    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Kate Darling,</p>
<p>her second time on the podcast.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a research scientist at MIT Media Lab,</p>
<p>interested in human-robot interaction and robot ethics,</p>
<p>which she writes about in her recent book</p>
<p>called The New Breed,</p>
<p>what our history with animals reveals</p>
<p>about our future with robots.</p>
<p>Kate is one of my favorite people at MIT.</p>
<p>She was a courageous voice of reason and compassion</p>
<p>through the time of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal</p>
<p>at MIT three years ago.</p>
<p>We reflect on this time in this very conversation,</p>
<p>including the lessons it revealed about human nature</p>
<p>and our optimistic vision for the future of MIT,</p>
<p>a university we both love and believe in.</p>
<p>And now, a quick second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got True Classic Tees for high-quality t-shirts,</p>
<p>Shopify for e-commerce, Linode for Linux,</p>
<p>Insight Tracker for bio-monitoring,</p>
<p>and ExpressVPN for privacy.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now, onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I hate those.</p>
<p>And since I do this podcast, I&rsquo;m able to control</p>
<p>whether we do them or not.</p>
<p>I try to make these interesting, but if you skip them,</p>
<p>please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by,</p>
<p>I believe in you sponsor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been wearing their t-shirts for a while now,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t remember,</p>
<p>but I do remember that I&rsquo;ve been loving it for a while now.</p>
<p>Anyway, the sponsor is True Classic Tees.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re high-quality, soft, slim-fitted t-shirts for men.</p>
<p>They also make all the other menswear staples,</p>
<p>like polos and workout shirts,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all built with the same flattering fit</p>
<p>as their t-shirts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of fascinating how something like a t-shirt</p>
<p>can feel good and look good,</p>
<p>and the way to achieve those two goals</p>
<p>are very subtle design decisions.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fascinating because I&rsquo;m a t-shirt person.</p>
<p>I usually just wear a black t-shirt,</p>
<p>a bunch of black t-shirts.</p>
<p>True Classic Tees is an example of a company that delivers.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve tried it, that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve been wearing.</p>
<p>I feel amazing.</p>

<p>This show is also brought to you by Shopify,</p>
<p>a platform designed for anyone to sell anywhere,</p>
<p>with a great-looking online store</p>
<p>that brings your ideas to life</p>
<p>and gives you tools to manage day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Shopify for a while to sell stuff,</p>
<p>but my use cases are pretty simple,</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s probably true for many people,</p>
<p>for many merchants.</p>
<p>You just wanna sell a couple of things that you care about</p>
<p>and to a small set of people</p>
<p>that are interested in that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s a lot of entrepreneurs</p>
<p>that really use Shopify to run a business,</p>
<p>small business, medium-sized business,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s 1.7 million entrepreneurs that use it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s my favorite, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.</p>
<p>If you look on Reddit and all those other kinds of places,</p>
<p>Shopify is the recommended place to sell stuff online.</p>
<p>Super easy to use, super easy to set up, all that.</p>
<p>Get a free trial and full access</p>
<p>to Shopify&rsquo;s entire suite of features</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all lowercase, Shopify.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This episode is also brought to you by Linode,</p>
<p>Linux Virtual Machines.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an awesome computer infrastructure</p>
<p>that I just love everything about it.</p>
<p>It lets you develop, deploy, and scale</p>
<p>what applications you build faster and easier.</p>
<p>I use it for small personal projects.</p>
<p>I hope to one day have huge projects that I can run on it.</p>
<p>I think the big competitor is AWS.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably a bunch of others, but AWS.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s lower cost than AWS, better customer service,</p>
<p>the simplicity of everything.</p>
<p>I just love it.</p>
<p>Obviously, computer infrastructure,</p>
<p>the compute has to be really good, right?</p>
<p>The actual systems have to be really good.</p>
<p>The distributed compute has to be good.</p>
<p>But the interface from a user perspective</p>
<p>of how you set everything up, how you scale,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff, also should be good.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s actually more important,</p>
<p>the ability to set stuff up, to monitor,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really why I love Linode.</p>
<p>And of course, the number one reason,</p>
<p>or should I say the number zero reason,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s Linux.</p>
<p>I love Linux, all things Linux.</p>

<p>This show is also brought to you by InsideTracker,</p>
<p>a service I use to track biological data.</p>
<p>They have a bunch of plans that collect</p>
<p>a bunch of information from your body</p>
<p>and you use machine learning algorithms</p>
<p>to analyze your blood data, DNA data, fitness tracker data,</p>
<p>all of that to give you a picture</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s going on inside you and give you recommendations</p>
<p>for diet lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>I wish they gave dating advice or career advice</p>
<p>or just food advice, what I should eat today</p>
<p>based on my body.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably the future.</p>
<p>My body is giving me very noisy signals</p>
<p>about when it&rsquo;s hungry and what it wants to eat.</p>
<p>I wish I had higher resolution signals</p>
<p>or the signals that it&rsquo;s sending needs to be interpreted.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably a lot of signal there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just my brain is too dumb to interpret it.</p>

<p>I use them to protect my privacy on the internet.</p>
<p>I also use them to feel good about my life.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m probably having a bunch of conversation</p>
<p>with cybersecurity folks on both sides.</p>
<p>I think I have a person coming on</p>
<p>that used to be an FBI agent doing cybersecurity</p>
<p>and also really want to get a bunch of hackers on.</p>
<p>Former, current hackers would be epic.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>because if they&rsquo;re current hackers,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this gray area about what they can</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t talk about, and I don&rsquo;t like gray areas.</p>
<p>I like people to be raw and transparent and real,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Kate Darling.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>Last time we talked a few years back,</p>
<p>you wore Justin Bieber&rsquo;s shirt for the podcast.</p>
<p>So now looking back, you&rsquo;re a respected researcher,</p>
<p>all the amazing accomplishments in robotics,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re an author.</p>
<p>Was this one of the proudest moments of your life?</p>
<p>Proudest decisions you&rsquo;ve ever made?</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>You handled it really well, though.</p>
<p>It was cool, because I walked in,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know you were going to be filming.</p>
<p>I walked in and you&rsquo;re in a fucking suit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, why are you all dressed up?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then you were so nice about it.</p>
<p>You made some excuses.</p>
<p>You were like, oh, well, I&rsquo;m interviewing some,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t you say you were interviewing</p>
<p>some military general afterwards to make me feel better?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m CTO of Lockheed Martin, I think.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s what it was.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t tell me, oh, I was dressed like this.</p>
<p>Are you an actual Bieber fan?</p>
<p>Or was that like one of those t-shirts</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in the back of the closet</p>
<p>that you use for painting?</p>
<p>I think I bought it for my husband as a joke.</p>
<p>And yeah, we were gut renovating a house at the time</p>
<p>and I had worn it to the site.</p>
<p>Got his joke and now you wear it.</p>
<p>Okay, have you worn it since?</p>
<p>Was this a one time?</p>
<p>How could I touch it again?</p>
<p>It was on your podcast, now it&rsquo;s framed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a wedding dress or something like that.</p>
<p>You only wear it once.</p>
<p>You are the author of The New Breed,</p>
<p>What Our History With Animals Reveals</p>
<p>About Our Future With Robots.</p>
<p>You opened the book with the surprisingly tricky question,</p>
<p>what is a robot?</p>
<p>So let me ask you, let&rsquo;s try to sneak up to this question.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a robot?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not really sneaking up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just asking it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right, well.</p>
<p>What do you think a robot is?</p>
<p>What I think a robot is,</p>
<p>is something that has some level of intelligence</p>
<p>and some level of magic.</p>
<p>That little shine in the eye, you know,</p>
<p>that allows you to navigate the uncertainty of life.</p>
<p>So that means like autonomous vehicles to me in that sense,</p>
<p>are robots because they navigate the uncertainty,</p>
<p>the complexity of life.</p>
<p>Obviously social robots are that.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>I like that you mentioned magic because that also,</p>
<p>well, so first of all,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t define robot definitively in the book</p>
<p>because there is no definition that everyone agrees on.</p>
<p>And if you look back through time,</p>
<p>people have called things robots until they lose the magic</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re more ubiquitous.</p>
<p>Like a vending machine used to be called a robot</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s not, right?</p>
<p>So I do agree with you that there&rsquo;s this magic aspect</p>
<p>which is how people understand robots.</p>
<p>If you ask a roboticist,</p>
<p>they have the definition of something that is,</p>
<p>well, it has to be physical.</p>
<p>Usually it&rsquo;s not an AI agent.</p>
<p>It has to be embodied.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll say it has to be able to sense its environment</p>
<p>in some way.</p>
<p>It has to be able to make a decision autonomously</p>
<p>and then act on its environment again.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a pretty good technical definition</p>
<p>even though it really breaks down</p>
<p>when you come to things like the smartphone</p>
<p>because the smartphone can do all of those things</p>
<p>and most robotists would not call it a robot.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s really no one good definition</p>
<p>but part of why I wrote the book</p>
<p>is because people have a definition of robot in their minds</p>
<p>that is usually very focused</p>
<p>on a comparison of robots to humans.</p>
<p>So if you Google image search robot,</p>
<p>you get a bunch of humanoid robots,</p>
<p>robots with a torso and head and two arms and two legs.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the definition of robot</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m trying to get us away from</p>
<p>because I think that it trips us up a lot.</p>
<p>Why does the humanoid form trip us up a lot?</p>
<p>Well, because this constant comparison of robots to people,</p>
<p>artificial intelligence to human intelligence,</p>
<p>first of all, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>from a technical perspective</p>
<p>because the early AI researchers,</p>
<p>some of them were trying to recreate human intelligence.</p>
<p>Some people still are</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot to be learned</p>
<p>from that academically, et cetera.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not where we&rsquo;ve ended up.</p>
<p>AI doesn&rsquo;t think like people.</p>
<p>We wind up in this fallacy</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re comparing these two</p>
<p>and when we talk about what intelligence even is,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re often comparing to our own intelligence.</p>
<p>And then the second reason this bothers me</p>
<p>is because it doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s boring to recreate intelligence</p>
<p>that we already have.</p>
<p>I see the scientific value</p>
<p>of understanding our own intelligence,</p>
<p>but from a like practical,</p>
<p>what could we use these technologies for perspective?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much more interesting to create something new,</p>
<p>to create a skillset that we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>that we can partner with</p>
<p>in what we&rsquo;re trying to achieve.</p>
<p>And it should be in some deep way similar to us,</p>
<p>but in most ways different</p>
<p>because you still want to have a connection,</p>
<p>which is why the similarity might be necessary.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what people argue, yes.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>So the two arguments for humanoid robots</p>
<p>are people need to be able to communicate</p>
<p>and relate to robots</p>
<p>and we relate most to things that are like ourselves.</p>
<p>And we have a world that&rsquo;s built for humans.</p>
<p>So we have stairs and narrow passageways and door handles.</p>
<p>And so we need humanoid robots to be able to navigate that.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re speaking to the first one,</p>
<p>which is absolutely true.</p>
<p>But what we know from social robotics</p>
<p>and a lot of human robot interaction research</p>
<p>is that all you need is something that&rsquo;s enough</p>
<p>like a person for it to give off cues</p>
<p>that someone relates to,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t have to look human or even act human.</p>
<p>You can take a robot like R2-D2</p>
<p>and it just like beeps and boops</p>
<p>and people love R2-D2, right?</p>
<p>Even though it&rsquo;s just like a trash can on wheels.</p>
<p>And they like R2-D2 more than C3PO, who&rsquo;s a humanoid.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s lots of ways to make robots</p>
<p>even better than humans in some ways</p>
<p>and make us relate more to them.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s kind of amazing the variety of cues</p>
<p>that can be used to anthropomorphize the thing,</p>
<p>like a glowing orb or something like that.</p>
<p>Just a voice, just subtle basic interaction.</p>
<p>I think people sometimes over-engineer these things.</p>
<p>Like simplicity can go a really long way.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>I mean, ask any animator and they&rsquo;ll know that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, those are actually,</p>
<p>so the people behind Cosmo, the robot,</p>
<p>the right people to design those is animators,</p>
<p>like Disney type of people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Versus like roboticists.</p>
<p>Roboticists, quote-unquote, are mostly clueless.</p>
<p>It seems like-</p>
<p>Well, no, they just have their own discipline</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re very good at and they don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that don&rsquo;t, you know.</p>
<p>I feel like robotics of the early 21st century</p>
<p>is not going to be the robotics of the later 21st century.</p>
<p>Like if you call yourself a roboticist,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be something very different.</p>
<p>Because I think more and more you&rsquo;d be like a,</p>
<p>maybe like a control engineer or something.</p>
<p>Controls engineer.</p>
<p>Like you separate, because ultimately all the unsolved,</p>
<p>all the big problems of robotics</p>
<p>will be in the social aspect,</p>
<p>in the interacting with humans aspect,</p>
<p>in the perception interpreting the world aspect,</p>
<p>in the brain part.</p>
<p>Not the basic control level part.</p>
<p>You call it basic, it&rsquo;s actually really complex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very complicated.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, but like, I think you&rsquo;re so right.</p>
<p>And what a time to be alive.</p>
<p>Because for me, I just,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had robots for so long</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve just been behind the scenes.</p>
<p>And now finally robots are getting deployed into the world.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re coming out of the closet.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we&rsquo;re seeing all these mistakes</p>
<p>that companies are making</p>
<p>because they focus so much on the engineering</p>
<p>and getting that right,</p>
<p>and getting the robot to even be able to function</p>
<p>in a space that it shares with a human.</p>
<p>See, what I feel like people don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>is to solve the perception and the control problem.</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t try to just solve</p>
<p>the perception control problem.</p>
<p>You should teach the robot how to say,</p>
<p>oh shit, I&rsquo;m sorry, I fucked up.</p>
<p>Yeah, or ask for help.</p>
<p>Ask for help or be able to communicate the uncertainty.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, all of those things.</p>
<p>Because you can&rsquo;t solve the perception control.</p>
<p>We humans haven&rsquo;t solved it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really damn good at it.</p>
<p>But the magic is in the self-deprecating humor</p>
<p>and the self-awareness about where our flaws are,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s a whole body of research</p>
<p>in human-robot interaction showing ways to do this.</p>
<p>But a lot of these companies haven&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t do HRI, they, like the,</p>
<p>have you seen the grocery store robot in the Stop and Shop?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, the Marty, it looks like a giant penis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like six feet tall, it roams the aisles.</p>
<p>I will never see Marty the same way again.</p>
<p>Thank you for that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p>But like, these poor people worked so hard</p>
<p>on getting a functional robot together.</p>
<p>And then people hate Marty</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t at all consider</p>
<p>how people would react to Marty in their space.</p>
<p>Does everybody, I mean, you talk about this,</p>
<p>do people mostly hate Marty?</p>
<p>Because I like Marty.</p>
<p>I feel like less.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you like Flippy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>And actually, like.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a parallel between the two?</p>
<p>I believe there is.</p>
<p>So we were actually gonna do a study on this</p>
<p>right before the pandemic hit,</p>
<p>and then we canceled it</p>
<p>because we didn&rsquo;t wanna go to the grocery store,</p>
<p>and neither did anyone else.</p>
<p>But our theory, so this was with a student at MIT,</p>
<p>Daniela Di Paola.</p>
<p>She noticed that everyone on Facebook, in her circles,</p>
<p>was complaining about Marty.</p>
<p>They were like, what is this creepy robot?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s watching me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always in the way.</p>
<p>And she did this quick and dirty sentiment analysis</p>
<p>on Twitter where she was looking at positive</p>
<p>and negative mentions of the robot.</p>
<p>And she found that the biggest spike</p>
<p>of negative mentions happened</p>
<p>when Stop and Shop threw a birthday party</p>
<p>for the Marty robots, like with free cake and balloons.</p>
<p>Who complains about free cake?</p>
<p>Well, people who hate Marty, apparently.</p>
<p>And so we were like, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And then we did this online poll.</p>
<p>We used Mechanical Turk,</p>
<p>and we tried to get at what people don&rsquo;t like about Marty.</p>
<p>And a lot of it wasn&rsquo;t, oh, Marty&rsquo;s taking jobs.</p>
<p>It was, Marty is the surveillance robot, which it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It looks for spills on the floor.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t actually look at any people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s watching.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s creepy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting in the way.</p>
<p>Those were the things that people complained about.</p>
<p>And so our hypothesis became, is Marty a real life Clippy?</p>
<p>Because I know, Alex, you love Clippy,</p>
<p>but many people hated Clippy.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a complex thing there.</p>
<p>It could be like marriage.</p>
<p>A lot of people seem to like to complain about marriage,</p>
<p>but they secretly love it.</p>
<p>So it could be, the relationship you might have</p>
<p>with Marty is like, oh, there he goes again,</p>
<p>doing his stupid surveillance thing.</p>
<p>But you grow to love the, I mean,</p>
<p>bitching about the thing</p>
<p>that kind of releases a kind of tension.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, I mean, some people, a lot of people,</p>
<p>show love by sort of busting each other&rsquo;s chops,</p>
<p>you know, like making fun of each other.</p>
<p>And then I think people would really love it</p>
<p>if Marty talked back.</p>
<p>And like, these are so many possible options</p>
<p>for humor there.</p>
<p>One, you can lean in.</p>
<p>You can be like, yes, I&rsquo;m an agent of the CIA,</p>
<p>monitoring your every move,</p>
<p>like mocking people that are concerned,</p>
<p>you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Like, yes, I&rsquo;m watching you because you&rsquo;re so important</p>
<p>with your shopping patterns.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m collecting all this data.</p>
<p>Or just, you know, any kind of making fun of people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I think you hit on what exactly it is</p>
<p>because when it comes to robots or artificial agents,</p>
<p>I think people hate them more</p>
<p>than they would some other machine or device or object.</p>
<p>And it might be that thing,</p>
<p>it might be combined with love or like whatever it is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a more extreme response</p>
<p>because they view these things as social agents</p>
<p>and not objects.</p>
<p>And that was, so Clifford Nass</p>
<p>was a big human-computer interaction person.</p>
<p>And his theory about Clippy was that</p>
<p>because people viewed Clippy as a social agent,</p>
<p>when Clippy was annoying and would like bother them</p>
<p>and interrupt them and like not remember what they told him,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when people got upset</p>
<p>because it wasn&rsquo;t fulfilling their social expectations.</p>
<p>And so they complained about Clippy</p>
<p>more than they would have if it had been a different,</p>
<p>like not a, you know, virtual character.</p>
<p>So is complaining to you a sign</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re on the wrong path with a particular robot?</p>
<p>Or is it possible, like again, like marriage,</p>
<p>like family, that there still is a path</p>
<p>towards that direction</p>
<p>where we can find deep, meaningful relationships?</p>
<p>I think we absolutely can find</p>
<p>deep, meaningful relationships with robots.</p>
<p>And well, maybe with Marty.</p>
<p>I mean, I just would,</p>
<p>I would have designed Marty a little differently.</p>
<p>Like how?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there a charm to the clumsiness, the slowness?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ll sometimes just-</p>
<p>There is if you&rsquo;re not trying to get through</p>
<p>with a shopping cart and a screaming child.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s, I think,</p>
<p>I think you could make it charming.</p>
<p>I think there are lots of design tricks</p>
<p>that they could have used.</p>
<p>And one of the things they did,</p>
<p>I think without thinking about it at all,</p>
<p>is they slapped two big googly eyes on Marty.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>And I wonder if that contributed</p>
<p>maybe to people feeling watched</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s looking at them.</p>
<p>And so like, is there a way to design the robot</p>
<p>to do the function that it&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>in a way that people are actually attracted to</p>
<p>rather than annoyed by?</p>
<p>And there are many ways to do that,</p>
<p>but companies aren&rsquo;t thinking about it.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re realizing that</p>
<p>they should have thought about it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s a way to,</p>
<p>if it would help to make Marty</p>
<p>seem like an entity of its own</p>
<p>versus the arm of a large corporation.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some sense where this is just the camera</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s monitoring people versus this is an entity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a standalone entity.</p>
<p>It has its own task and it has its own personality.</p>
<p>The more personality you give it,</p>
<p>the more it feels like it&rsquo;s not sharing data</p>
<p>with anybody else.</p>
<p>When we see other human beings,</p>
<p>our basic assumption is whatever I say to this human being,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like being immediately sent to the CIA.</p>
<p>Yeah, what I say to you, no one&rsquo;s gonna hear that, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>No, no, I&rsquo;m kidding.</p>
<p>Well, you forget it.</p>
<p>I mean, you do forget it.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if even with microphones here,</p>
<p>you forget that that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>But for some reason, I think probably with Marty,</p>
<p>I think when it&rsquo;s done really crudely and crappily,</p>
<p>you start to realize, oh, this is like PR people</p>
<p>trying to make a friendly version</p>
<p>of a surveillance machine.</p>
<p>But I mean, that reminds me of the slight clumsiness</p>
<p>or significant clumsiness on the initial releases</p>
<p>of the avatars for the metaverse.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, what are your actually thoughts about that?</p>
<p>The way the avatars, the way like Mark Zuckerberg</p>
<p>looks in that world, in the metaverse,</p>
<p>the virtual reality world where you can have</p>
<p>like virtual meetings and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Like how do we get that right?</p>
<p>Do you have thoughts about that?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a kind of, it feels like a similar problem</p>
<p>to social robotics, which is how you design</p>
<p>a digital virtual world that is compelling</p>
<p>when you connect to others there</p>
<p>in the same way that physical connection is.</p>
<p>Right, I haven&rsquo;t looked into, I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen people joking about it on Twitter</p>
<p>and like posting whatever.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I mean, have you seen it?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s something you can&rsquo;t quite put into words</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t feel genuine about the way it looks.</p>
<p>And so the question is, if you and I were to meet virtually,</p>
<p>what should the avatars look like</p>
<p>for us to have a similar kind of connection?</p>
<p>Should it be really simplified?</p>
<p>Should it be a little bit more realistic?</p>
<p>Should it be cartoonish?</p>
<p>Should it be more, better capturing of expressions</p>
<p>in interesting, complex ways versus like cartoonish,</p>
<p>oversimplified ways?</p>
<p>But haven&rsquo;t video games figured this out?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a gamer, so I don&rsquo;t have any examples,</p>
<p>but I feel like there&rsquo;s this whole world in video games</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;ve thought about all of this</p>
<p>and depending on the game, they have different like avatars</p>
<p>and a lot of the games are about connecting with others.</p>
<p>I just, the thing that I don&rsquo;t know is,</p>
<p>and again, I haven&rsquo;t looked into this at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been like shockingly not very interested</p>
<p>in the metaverse, but they must have poured</p>
<p>so much investment into this meta.</p>
<p>And like, why is it so, why are people, why is it so bad?</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s gotta be a reason.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gotta be some thinking behind it, right?</p>
<p>Well, I talked to Carmack about this,</p>
<p>John Carmack, who&rsquo;s a part-time Oculus CTO.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s several things to say.</p>
<p>One is, as you probably know, that I mean,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s bureaucracy, there&rsquo;s large corporations</p>
<p>and they often, large corporations have a way</p>
<p>of killing the indie kind of artistic flame</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s required to create something really compelling.</p>
<p>Somehow they make everything boring</p>
<p>because they run through this whole process</p>
<p>through the PR department, through all that kind of stuff</p>
<p>and it somehow becomes generic to that process.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s like-</p>
<p>They strip out anything interesting</p>
<p>because it could be controversial, is that, or?</p>
<p>Yeah, right, exactly.</p>
<p>Like, what, I mean, we&rsquo;re living through this now,</p>
<p>like, with a lot of people with cancellations</p>
<p>and all those kinds of stuff, people are nervous</p>
<p>and nervousness results in, like usual,</p>
<p>the assholes are ruining everything.</p>
<p>But, you know, the magic of human connection</p>
<p>is taking risks, of making a risky joke,</p>
<p>of like, with people you like who are not assholes,</p>
<p>good people, like, some of the fun in the metaverse</p>
<p>or in video games is, you know, being edgier,</p>
<p>being interesting, revealing your personality</p>
<p>in interesting ways.</p>
<p>In the sexual tension or in,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re definitely paranoid about that.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Like, in metaverse, the possibility of sexual assault</p>
<p>and sexual harassment and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obviously very high, but they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>so you should be paranoid to some degree,</p>
<p>but not too much because then you remove completely</p>
<p>the personality of the whole thing.</p>
<p>Then everybody&rsquo;s just like a vanilla bot that,</p>
<p>like, you have to have ability</p>
<p>to be a little bit political, to be a little bit edgy,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>and large companies tend to suffocate that.</p>
<p>So, but in general, if you get all that,</p>
<p>just the ability to come up</p>
<p>with really cool, beautiful ideas.</p>
<p>If you look at, I think Grimes tweeted about this,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s very critical about the metaverse,</p>
<p>is that,</p>
<p>you know, independent game designers have solved this problem</p>
<p>of how to create something beautiful</p>
<p>and interesting and compelling.</p>
<p>They do a really good job.</p>
<p>So, you have to let those kinds of minds,</p>
<p>the small groups of people, design things</p>
<p>and let them run with it, let them run wild</p>
<p>and do edgy stuff, yeah.</p>
<p>But otherwise, you get this kind of,</p>
<p>you get a clippy type of situation, right,</p>
<p>which is like a very generic looking thing.</p>
<p>But even clippy has some, like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of wild that you would take a paperclip</p>
<p>and put eyes on it.</p>
<p>And suddenly people are like, oh, you&rsquo;re annoying,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re definitely a social agent.</p>
<p>And I just feel like that wouldn&rsquo;t even,</p>
<p>that clippy thing wouldn&rsquo;t even survive Microsoft</p>
<p>or Facebook of today, meta of today.</p>
<p>Because it would be like, well,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be these meetings about why is it a paperclip?</p>
<p>Like, why don&rsquo;t we, it&rsquo;s not sufficiently friendly,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s make it, you know.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden,</p>
<p>the artist with whom it originated is killed</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all PR, marketing people</p>
<p>and all of that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Now, they do important work to some degree,</p>
<p>but they kill the creativity.</p>
<p>I think the killing of the creativity is in the whole,</p>
<p>like, okay, so what I know from social robotics is like,</p>
<p>obviously, if you create agents that,</p>
<p>okay, so take for an example,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d create a robot that looks like a humanoid</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, you know, Sophia or whatever.</p>
<p>Now, suddenly you do have all of these issues</p>
<p>where are you reinforcing an unrealistic beauty standard?</p>
<p>Are you objectifying women?</p>
<p>Why is the robot?</p>
<p>So you have, but the thing is,</p>
<p>I think that with creativity,</p>
<p>you can find a solution that&rsquo;s even better</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not even harming anyone</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re creating a robot that looks like not humanoid,</p>
<p>but like something that people relate to even more.</p>
<p>And now you don&rsquo;t even have any of these bias issues</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re creating.</p>
<p>And so how do we create that within companies?</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s really about,</p>
<p>like, I, cause I, you know, maybe we disagree on that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that edginess or humor or interesting things</p>
<p>need to be things that harm or hurt people</p>
<p>or that people are against.</p>
<p>There are ways to find things that everyone is fine with.</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t we doing that?</p>
<p>The problem is there&rsquo;s departments</p>
<p>that look for harm in things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so they will find harm in things that have no harm.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the big problem</p>
<p>because their whole job is to find harm in things.</p>
<p>So what you said is completely correct,</p>
<p>which is edginess should not hurt,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t need to be a thing that hurts people.</p>
<p>Obviously, great humor, great personality</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to, like Clippy.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, but it&rsquo;s tricky to get right.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not exactly sure.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why a large corporation</p>
<p>with a lot of funding can&rsquo;t get this right.</p>
<p>I do think you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a lot of aversion to risk.</p>
<p>And so if you get lawyers involved</p>
<p>or people whose job it is, like you say, to mitigate risk,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just gonna say no to most things</p>
<p>that could even be in some way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, you get the problem in all organizations.</p>
<p>So I think that you&rsquo;re right, that that is a problem.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s the way to solve that in large organizations</p>
<p>is to have Steve Jobs type of characters.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you do need to have, I think,</p>
<p>from a designer perspective, or maybe like a Johnny Ive,</p>
<p>that is almost like a dictator.</p>
<p>Yeah, you want a benevolent dictator.</p>
<p>Yeah, who rolls in and says,</p>
<p>cuts through the lawyers, the PR,</p>
<p>but has a benevolent aspect.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, there&rsquo;s a good heart and make sure,</p>
<p>I think all great artists and designers</p>
<p>create stuff that doesn&rsquo;t hurt people.</p>
<p>Like if you have a good heart,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to create something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to actually make a lot of people feel good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what people like Johnny Ive,</p>
<p>what they love doing is creating a thing</p>
<p>that brings a lot of love to the world.</p>
<p>They imagine millions of people using the thing</p>
<p>and it instills them with joy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, you could say that about social robotics,</p>
<p>you could say that about the metaverse.</p>
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t be done by the PR people,</p>
<p>should be done by the designers.</p>
<p>I agree, PR people ruin everything.</p>
<p>Yeah, all the fun.</p>
<p>In the book, you have a picture,</p>
<p>I just have a lot of ridiculous questions.</p>
<p>You have a picture of two hospital delivery robots</p>
<p>with a caption that reads,</p>
<p>by the way, see your book,</p>
<p>I appreciate that it keeps the humor in.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t run it by the PR department.</p>
<p>No, no one edited the book, we got rushed through.</p>
<p>Bad thing.</p>
<p>The caption reads,</p>
<p>two hospital delivery robots whose sexy nurse names</p>
<p>Roxy and Lola made me roll my eyes so hard</p>
<p>they almost fell out.</p>
<p>What aspect of it made you roll your eyes?</p>
<p>Is it the naming?</p>
<p>It was the naming.</p>
<p>The form factor is fine, it&rsquo;s like a little box on wheels.</p>
<p>The fact that they named them, also great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll let people enjoy interacting with them.</p>
<p>We know that even just giving a robot a name,</p>
<p>it facilitates technology adoption.</p>
<p>People will be like, oh, you know,</p>
<p>Betsy made a mistake, let&rsquo;s help her out</p>
<p>instead of the stupid robot doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>But why Lola and Roxy?</p>
<p>Like-</p>
<p>Those are to you, too sexy?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s research showing that</p>
<p>a lot of robots are named according to gender biases</p>
<p>about the function that they&rsquo;re fulfilling.</p>
<p>So, you know, robots that are helpful and assistance</p>
<p>and are like nurses are usually female gendered.</p>
<p>Robots that are powerful, all wise computers like Watson</p>
<p>usually have like a booming male coded voice and name.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s one of those things, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re opening a can of worms for no reason.</p>
<p>For no reason.</p>
<p>You can avoid this whole can of worms.</p>
<p>Yeah, just give it a different name.</p>
<p>Like why Roxy?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because people aren&rsquo;t even thinking.</p>
<p>So to some extent, I don&rsquo;t like PR departments,</p>
<p>but getting some feedback on your work</p>
<p>from a diverse set of participants,</p>
<p>listening and taking in things</p>
<p>that help you identify your own blind spots.</p>
<p>And then you can always make your good leadership choices</p>
<p>and good, like you can still ignore things</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t believe are an issue,</p>
<p>but having the openness to take in feedback</p>
<p>and making sure that you&rsquo;re getting the right feedback</p>
<p>from the right people.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>And also don&rsquo;t unnecessarily propagate</p>
<p>the biases of society.</p>
<p>Yeah, why?</p>
<p>In the design.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re not careful when you do the research of,</p>
<p>like you might, if you ran a poll with a lot of people,</p>
<p>of all the possible names these robots have,</p>
<p>they might come up with Roxy and Lola</p>
<p>as names they would enjoy most.</p>
<p>Like that could come up as the highest.</p>
<p>As in you do marketing research,</p>
<p>and then, well, that&rsquo;s what they did with Alexa.</p>
<p>They did marketing research,</p>
<p>and nobody wanted the male voice.</p>
<p>Everyone wanted it to be female.</p>
<p>Well, what do you think about that?</p>
<p>If I were to say, I think the role of a great designer,</p>
<p>again, to go back to Johnny Ive,</p>
<p>is to throw out the marketing research.</p>
<p>Take it in, do it, learn from it.</p>
<p>But if everyone wants Alexa to be a female voice,</p>
<p>the role of the designer is to think deeply</p>
<p>about the future of social agents in the home,</p>
<p>and think, what does that future look like?</p>
<p>And try to reverse engineer that future.</p>
<p>So in some sense, there&rsquo;s this weird tension.</p>
<p>You want to listen to a lot of people,</p>
<p>but at the same time, you&rsquo;re creating a thing</p>
<p>that defines the future of the world,</p>
<p>and the people that you&rsquo;re listening to</p>
<p>are part of the past.</p>
<p>So that weird tension.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>and I think some companies like Apple</p>
<p>have historically done very well</p>
<p>at understanding a market and saying,</p>
<p>you know what our role is?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not to listen to what the current market says.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to actually shape the market</p>
<p>and shape consumer preferences.</p>
<p>And companies have the power to do that.</p>
<p>They can be forward thinking,</p>
<p>and they can actually shift</p>
<p>what the future of technology looks like.</p>
<p>And I agree with you that I would like to see more of that,</p>
<p>especially when it comes to existing biases that we know.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s the low-hanging fruit</p>
<p>of companies that don&rsquo;t even think about it at all,</p>
<p>and aren&rsquo;t talking to the right people,</p>
<p>and aren&rsquo;t getting the full information.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s companies</p>
<p>that are just doing the safe thing</p>
<p>and giving consumers what they want now.</p>
<p>But to be really forward-looking and be really successful,</p>
<p>I think you have to make some judgment calls</p>
<p>about what the future is gonna be.</p>
<p>But do you think it&rsquo;s still useful to gender</p>
<p>and to name the robots?</p>
<p>Yes, I mean, gender is a minefield,</p>
<p>but people, it&rsquo;s really hard to get people</p>
<p>to not gender a robot in some way.</p>
<p>So if you don&rsquo;t give it a name,</p>
<p>or you give it an ambiguous voice,</p>
<p>people will just choose something.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s better than just entrenching something</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve decided is best.</p>
<p>But I do think it can be helpful</p>
<p>on the anthropomorphism engagement level</p>
<p>to give it attributes that people identify with.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think a lot of roboticists I know,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t gender the robot.</p>
<p>They even try to avoid naming the robot.</p>
<p>Or naming it ain&rsquo;t something that can be used</p>
<p>as a name in conversation kind of thing.</p>
<p>And I think that actually, that&rsquo;s irresponsible,</p>
<p>because people are going to anthropomorphize</p>
<p>the thing anyway.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re just removing from yourself</p>
<p>the responsibility of how they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to anthropomorphize it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point.</p>
<p>And so you want to be able to,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re going to do it,</p>
<p>you have to start to think about how they&rsquo;re going to do it.</p>
<p>Even if the robot is like a Boston Dynamics robot</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not supposed to have any kind of social component,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re obviously going to project</p>
<p>a social component to it.</p>
<p>Like that arm, I worked a lot with quadrupeds now</p>
<p>with robot dogs.</p>
<p>You know, that arm, people think it&rsquo;s a head immediately.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s supposed to be an arm,</p>
<p>but they start to think it&rsquo;s a head.</p>
<p>And you have to like acknowledge that.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, I mean-</p>
<p>They do now.</p>
<p>They do now?</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;ve deployed the robots and people are like,</p>
<p>oh my God, the cops are using a robot dog.</p>
<p>And so they have this PR nightmare.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re like, oh yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe we should hire some HR people.</p>
<p>Well, Boston Dynamics is an interesting company,</p>
<p>or any of the others that are doing a similar thing,</p>
<p>because their main source of money</p>
<p>is in industrial applications.</p>
<p>So like surveillance of factories and doing dangerous jobs.</p>
<p>So to them, it&rsquo;s almost good PR</p>
<p>for people to be scared of these things.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s for some reason, as you talk about,</p>
<p>people are naturally, for some reason, scared.</p>
<p>We could talk about that, of robots.</p>
<p>And so it becomes more viral,</p>
<p>like playing with that little fear.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s almost like a good PR,</p>
<p>because ultimately, they&rsquo;re not trying</p>
<p>to put them in the home and have a good social connection.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to put them in factories.</p>
<p>And so they have fun with it.</p>
<p>If you watch Boston Dynamics videos,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re aware of it.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, the videos for sure, that they put out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like an unspoken, tongue-in-cheek thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re aware of how people are going to feel</p>
<p>when you have a robot that does like a flip.</p>
<p>Now, most of the people are just like excited</p>
<p>about the control problem of it,</p>
<p>like how to make the whole thing happen.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re aware when people see.</p>
<p>Well, I think they became aware.</p>
<p>I think that in the beginning,</p>
<p>they were really, really focused on just the engineering.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re at the forefront of robotics,</p>
<p>like locomotion and stuff.</p>
<p>And then when they started doing the videos,</p>
<p>I think that was kind of a labor of love.</p>
<p>I know that the former CEO, Mark,</p>
<p>he oversaw a lot of the videos</p>
<p>and made a lot of them himself.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s even really detail-oriented.</p>
<p>There can&rsquo;t be some sort of incline</p>
<p>that would give the robot an advantage.</p>
<p>He was very, a lot of integrity</p>
<p>about the authenticity of them.</p>
<p>But then when they started to go viral,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s when they started to realize,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s something interesting here that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much they took it seriously</p>
<p>in the beginning other than realizing</p>
<p>that they could play with it in the videos.</p>
<p>I know that they take it very seriously now.</p>
<p>What I like about Boston Dynamics and similar companies,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still mostly run by engineers.</p>
<p>But, you know, I&rsquo;ve had my criticisms.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bit more PR leaking in.</p>
<p>But those videos are made by engineers</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what they find fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like testing the robustness of the system.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re having a lot of fun there with the robots.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Have you been to visit?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most incredible.</p>
<p>I mean, because I have eight robot dogs now.</p>
<p>Wait, you have eight robot dogs?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re just walking around your place?</p>
<p>Like, where do you keep them?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m working on them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually one of my goals</p>
<p>is to have at any one time always a robot moving.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m far away from that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an ambitious goal.</p>
<p>Well, I have like more Roombas that I know what to do with.</p>
<p>Those are the Roombas that I program.</p>
<p>So the programmable Roombas.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>And I have a bunch of little, like I built a,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m not finished with it yet,</p>
<p>but I bought a robot from Rick and Morty.</p>
<p>I just have a bunch of robots everywhere.</p>
<p>But the thing is, what happens is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re working on one robot at a time,</p>
<p>and that becomes like a little project.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually very difficult to have</p>
<p>just a passively functioning robot always moving.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a dream for me,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;d love to create that kind of little world.</p>
<p>So the impressive thing about Boston Dynamics to me</p>
<p>was to see like hundreds of spots.</p>
<p>And like, there was a,</p>
<p>the most impressive thing that still sticks with me is</p>
<p>there was a spot robot walking down the hall</p>
<p>seemingly with no supervision whatsoever.</p>
<p>And he was wearing, he or she, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>was wearing a cowboy hat.</p>
<p>It just, it was just walking down the hall</p>
<p>and nobody paying attention.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like walking down this long hall.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like looking around.</p>
<p>Is anyone, like what&rsquo;s happening here?</p>
<p>So presumably some kind of automation was doing the map.</p>
<p>I mean, the whole environment is probably really well mapped.</p>
<p>But I, it was just,</p>
<p>it gave me a picture of a world</p>
<p>where a robot is doing his thing, wearing a cowboy hat,</p>
<p>just going down the hall,</p>
<p>like getting some coffee or whatever.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s doing, what&rsquo;s the mission.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know, for some reason it really stuck with me.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t often see robots that aren&rsquo;t part of a demo</p>
<p>or that aren&rsquo;t, you know, like with a semi-autonomous</p>
<p>or autonomous vehicle, like directly doing a task.</p>
<p>This was just chilling.</p>
<p>Just walking around, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, you know, I mean, we&rsquo;re at MIT.</p>
<p>Like when I first got to MIT, I was like,</p>
<p>okay, where&rsquo;s all the robots?</p>
<p>And they were all like broken or like not demoing.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>And what really excites me is that we&rsquo;re about to have that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re about to have so many moving about too.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coming in our lifetime</p>
<p>that we will just have robots moving around.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re already seeing the beginnings of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s delivery robots in some cities, on the sidewalks.</p>
<p>And I just love seeing like the TikToks</p>
<p>of people reacting to that.</p>
<p>Because yeah, you see a robot walking down the hall</p>
<p>with a cowboy hat.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, what the fuck?</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>This is awesome and scary and kind of awesome.</p>
<p>And people either love or hate it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the things</p>
<p>that I think companies are underestimating,</p>
<p>that people will either love a robot or hate a robot</p>
<p>and nothing in between.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just, again, an exciting time to be alive.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think kids almost universally,</p>
<p>at least in my experience, love them.</p>
<p>Love legged robots.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re not loud.</p>
<p>My son hates the Roomba because ours is loud.</p>
<p>Oh, that, yeah.</p>
<p>No, the legs, the legs make a difference.</p>
<p>Because your son,</p>
<p>do they understand Roomba to be a robot?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, my kids, that&rsquo;s one of the first words they learned.</p>
<p>They know how to say beep boop.</p>
<p>And yes, they think the Roomba&rsquo;s a robot.</p>
<p>Do they project intelligence out of the thing?</p>
<p>Well, we don&rsquo;t really use it around them anymore</p>
<p>for the reason that my son is scared of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>I think they would.</p>
<p>Even a Roomba, because it&rsquo;s moving around on its own,</p>
<p>I think kids and animals view it as an agent.</p>
<p>So what do you think,</p>
<p>if we just look at the state of the art of robotics,</p>
<p>what do you think robots are actually good at today?</p>
<p>So if we look at today.</p>
<p>You mean physical robots?</p>
<p>Yeah, physical robots.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Like what are you impressed by?</p>
<p>So I think a lot of people,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what your book is about,</p>
<p>have maybe not a perfectly calibrated understanding</p>
<p>of where we are in terms of robotics,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s difficult in robotics, what&rsquo;s easy in robotics.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re way behind where people think we are.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s impressive to me, so let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>Oh, one thing that came out recently</p>
<p>was Amazon has this new warehouse robot,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the first autonomous warehouse robot</p>
<p>that is safe for people to be around.</p>
<p>And so most people, I think,</p>
<p>envision that our warehouses are already fully automated</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s just robots doing things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually still really difficult</p>
<p>to have robots and people in the same space</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s dangerous, for the most part.</p>
<p>Especially robots that have to be strong enough</p>
<p>to move something heavy, for example,</p>
<p>they can really hurt somebody.</p>
<p>And so until now, a lot of the warehouse robots</p>
<p>had to just move along pre-existing lines,</p>
<p>which really restricts what you can do.</p>
<p>And so having, I think, that&rsquo;s one of the big challenges</p>
<p>and one of the big exciting things that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re starting to see more cobotics</p>
<p>in industrial spaces like that,</p>
<p>where people and robots can work side by side</p>
<p>and not get harmed.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what people don&rsquo;t realize,</p>
<p>sort of the physical manipulation task with humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that the robots wanna hurt you.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what people are worried about,</p>
<p>like this malevolent robot gets mad of its own</p>
<p>and wants to destroy all humans.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s actually very difficult</p>
<p>to know where the human is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And to respond to the human and dynamically</p>
<p>and collaborate with them on a task,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re something like</p>
<p>an industrial robotic arm, which is extremely powerful.</p>
<p>See, some of those arms are pretty impressive now</p>
<p>that you can grab it, you can move it.</p>
<p>So the collaboration between human and robot</p>
<p>in the factory setting is really fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you think they&rsquo;ll take our jobs?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that simple.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s a ton of disruption</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening and will continue to happen.</p>
<p>I think speaking specifically of the Amazon warehouses,</p>
<p>that might be an area where it would be good</p>
<p>for robots to take some of the jobs</p>
<p>that are where people are put in a position</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s unsafe and they&rsquo;re treated horribly.</p>
<p>And probably it would be better if a robot did that</p>
<p>and Amazon is clearly trying to automate that job away.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of disruption.</p>
<p>I do think that robots and humans</p>
<p>have very different skillsets.</p>
<p>So while a robot might take over a task,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna take over most jobs.</p>
<p>I think just things will change a lot.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know, one of the examples</p>
<p>I have in the book is mining.</p>
<p>So there you have this job that is very unsafe</p>
<p>and that requires a bunch of workers</p>
<p>and puts them in unsafe conditions.</p>
<p>And now you have all these different robotic machines</p>
<p>that can help make the job safer.</p>
<p>And as a result, now people can sit</p>
<p>in these air-conditioned remote control stations</p>
<p>and control these autonomous mining trucks.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a much better job,</p>
<p>but also they&rsquo;re employing less people now.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a lot of,</p>
<p>I think from a bird&rsquo;s eye perspective,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna see job loss.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna see more jobs created</p>
<p>because the future is not robots</p>
<p>just becoming like people and taking their jobs.</p>
<p>The future is really a combination of our skills</p>
<p>and then the supplemental skills that robots have</p>
<p>to increase productivity,</p>
<p>to help people have better, safer jobs,</p>
<p>to give people work that they actually enjoy doing</p>
<p>and are good at.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really easy to say that</p>
<p>from a bird&rsquo;s eye perspective.</p>
<p>And ignore kind of the rubble on the ground</p>
<p>as we go through these transitions,</p>
<p>because of course specific jobs are going to get lost.</p>
<p>If you look at the history of the 20th century,</p>
<p>it seems like automation constantly increases productivity</p>
<p>and improves the average quality of life.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been always good.</p>
<p>So like thinking about this time being different</p>
<p>is that it would need to go against the lessons of history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And the other thing is,</p>
<p>I think people think that the automation</p>
<p>of the physical tasks is easy.</p>
<p>I was just in Ukraine and the interesting thing is,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of difficult and dark lessons</p>
<p>just about a war zone.</p>
<p>But one of the things that happens in war</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a lot of mines that are placed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the big problems</p>
<p>for years after a war is even over</p>
<p>is the entire landscape is covered in mines.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a demining effort.</p>
<p>And you would think robots would be good</p>
<p>at this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Or like your intuition would be like,</p>
<p>well, say you have unlimited money</p>
<p>and you wanna do a good job of it, unlimited money.</p>
<p>You would get a lot of really nice robots.</p>
<p>But no, humans are still far superior.</p>
<p>Or animals.</p>
<p>Or animals, right.</p>
<p>But humans with animals together.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just have a dog with a hat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>But yes, but figuring out also how to disable the mine.</p>
<p>Obviously the easy thing,</p>
<p>the thing a robot can help with is to find the mine</p>
<p>and blow it up.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s gonna destroy the landscape.</p>
<p>That really does a lot of damage to the land.</p>
<p>You wanna disable the mine.</p>
<p>And to do that because of all the different,</p>
<p>all the different edge cases of the problem.</p>
<p>It requires a huge amount of human-like experience,</p>
<p>it seems like.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s mostly done by humans.</p>
<p>They have no use for robots.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want robots.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think we overestimate what we can automate.</p>
<p>Especially in the physical realm.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>I mean, it continues that the story of humans,</p>
<p>we think we&rsquo;re shitty at everything in the physical world,</p>
<p>including driving.</p>
<p>We think everybody makes fun of themselves</p>
<p>and others for being shitty drivers,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re actually kind of incredible.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re incredible.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why Tesla still says that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in the driver&rsquo;s seat,</p>
<p>like you are ultimately responsible.</p>
<p>Because the ideal for,</p>
<p>I mean, you know more about this than I do,</p>
<p>but like robot cars are great at predictable things</p>
<p>and can react faster and more precisely than a person</p>
<p>and can do a lot of the driving.</p>
<p>And then the reason that we still don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>autonomous vehicles on all the roads yet</p>
<p>is because of this long tail of just unexpected occurrences</p>
<p>where a human immediately understands</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a sunset and not a traffic light.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a horse and carriage ahead of me on the highway,</p>
<p>but the car has never encountered that before.</p>
<p>In theory, combining those skillsets</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s gonna really be powerful.</p>
<p>The only problem is figuring out</p>
<p>the human-robot interaction and the handoffs.</p>
<p>So like in cars, that&rsquo;s a huge problem right now,</p>
<p>figuring out the handoffs.</p>
<p>But in other areas, it might be easier.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really the future is human-robot interaction.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really hard to improve,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s terrible that people die in car accidents,</p>
<p>but I mean, it&rsquo;s like 70, 80, 100 million miles,</p>
<p>one death per 80 million miles.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like really hard to beat for a robot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like incredible.</p>
<p>Like think about it, like the, how many people?</p>
<p>Think just the number of people throughout the world</p>
<p>that are driving every single day.</p>
<p>All of this, you know, sleep deprived, drunk,</p>
<p>distracted, all of that.</p>
<p>And still very few die relative to what I would imagine.</p>
<p>If I were to guess, back in the horse,</p>
<p>see, when I was like in the beginning of the 20th century,</p>
<p>riding my horse, I would talk so much shit about these cars.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like, this is extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>These machines traveling at 30 miles an hour</p>
<p>or whatever the hell they&rsquo;re going at.</p>
<p>This is irresponsible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unnatural and it&rsquo;s going to be destructive</p>
<p>to all of human society.</p>
<p>But then it&rsquo;s extremely surprising</p>
<p>how humans adapt to the thing</p>
<p>and they know how to not kill each other.</p>
<p>I mean, that ability to adapt is incredible</p>
<p>and to mimic that in the machine is really tricky.</p>
<p>Now, that said, what Tesla is doing,</p>
<p>I mean, I wouldn&rsquo;t have guessed</p>
<p>how far machine learning can go on vision alone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, really incredible.</p>
<p>And people that are, at least from my perspective,</p>
<p>people that are kind of, you know,</p>
<p>critical of Elon and those efforts,</p>
<p>I think don&rsquo;t give enough credit</p>
<p>of how much incredible progress</p>
<p>has been made in that direction.</p>
<p>I think most of the robotics community</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have guessed how much you can do on vision alone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of incredible because we would be,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s that approach, which is relatively unique,</p>
<p>has challenged the other competitors to step up their game.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re using LIDAR, if you&rsquo;re using mapping,</p>
<p>that challenges them to do better, to scale faster,</p>
<p>and to use machine learning and computer vision as well</p>
<p>to integrate both LIDAR and vision.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of incredible.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not, I don&rsquo;t know if I even have a good intuition</p>
<p>of how hard driving is anymore.</p>
<p>Maybe it is possible to solve.</p>
<p>So all the sunset, all the edge cases you mentioned.</p>
<p>Yeah, the question is when.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s not happening</p>
<p>as quickly as people thought it would</p>
<p>because it is more complicated.</p>
<p>But I wouldn&rsquo;t have, I agree with you.</p>
<p>My current intuition is that we&rsquo;re gonna get there.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re gonna get there too.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t, before I wasn&rsquo;t sure we&rsquo;re gonna get there.</p>
<p>Without, like with current technology.</p>
<p>So I was kind of, this is like with vision alone,</p>
<p>my intuition was you&rsquo;re gonna have to solve</p>
<p>like common sense reasoning.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have to solve some of the big problems</p>
<p>in artificial intelligence, not just perception.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like you have to have a deep understanding of the world</p>
<p>is what was my sense.</p>
<p>But now I&rsquo;m starting to like, well this,</p>
<p>I mean I&rsquo;m continually surprised how well the thing works.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Obviously Elon and others, others have stopped.</p>
<p>But Elon continues, you know,</p>
<p>saying we&rsquo;re gonna solve it in a year.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the thing, bold predictions.</p>
<p>Yeah, but everyone else used to be doing that.</p>
<p>But they kind of like, all right.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe we&rsquo;ll.</p>
<p>Maybe let&rsquo;s not promise we&rsquo;re gonna solve</p>
<p>level four driving by 2020.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s chill on that.</p>
<p>But people are still trying silently.</p>
<p>I mean the UK just committed 100 million pounds</p>
<p>to research and development to speed up the process</p>
<p>of getting autonomous vehicles on the road.</p>
<p>Like everyone can see that it is solvable</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to happen and it&rsquo;s gonna change everything.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re still investing in it.</p>
<p>And like Waymo Lowkey has driverless cars in Arizona.</p>
<p>Like you can get, you know, there&rsquo;s like robots.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird, have you ever been in one?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so weird.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so awesome.</p>
<p>Because the most awesome experience is the wheel turning.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re sitting in the back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it feels like you&rsquo;re a passenger with that friend</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a little crazy of a driver.</p>
<p>It feels like, shit, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Are you all right to drive, bro?</p>
<p>You know, that kind of feeling.</p>
<p>But then you kind of, that experience,</p>
<p>that nervousness and the excitement</p>
<p>of trusting another being,</p>
<p>and in this case it&rsquo;s a machine, is really interesting.</p>
<p>Just even introspecting your own feelings about the thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not doing anything</p>
<p>in terms of making you feel better about,</p>
<p>like at least Waymo.</p>
<p>I think they went with the approach of like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not try to put eyes on the thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wheel, we know what that looks like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a car.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a car, get in the back.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not like discuss this at all.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not discuss the fact that this is a robot driving you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in the back.</p>
<p>And if the robot wants to start driving 80 miles an hour</p>
<p>and run off of a bridge, you have no recourse.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not discuss this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just getting in the back.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no discussion about like how shit can go wrong.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no eyes, there&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a map showing what the car can see.</p>
<p>Like, you know, what happens</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s like a HAL 9000 situation?</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m sorry, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You have a button you can like call customer service.</p>
<p>Oh God, then you get put on hold for two hours.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>But you know, currently what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>which I think is understandable,</p>
<p>but you know, the car just can pull over and stop</p>
<p>and wait for help to arrive.</p>
<p>And then a driver will come</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll actually drive the car for you.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>what if you&rsquo;re late for a meeting</p>
<p>or all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Or like the more dystopian,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it the fifth element where,</p>
<p>is Will Smith in that movie?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s in that movie?</p>
<p>No, Bruce Willis?</p>
<p>Bruce Willis.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and he gets into like a robotic cab</p>
<p>or car or something.</p>
<p>And then because he&rsquo;s violated a traffic rule,</p>
<p>it locks him in.</p>
<p>And he has to wait for the cops to come</p>
<p>and he can&rsquo;t get out.</p>
<p>So like, we&rsquo;re gonna see stuff like that maybe.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s, I believe that the companies that have robots,</p>
<p>the only ones that will succeed</p>
<p>are the ones that don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Meaning they respect privacy.</p>
<p>You think so?</p>
<p>Yeah, because people,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re gonna have to earn people&rsquo;s trust.</p>
<p>Yeah, but like Amazon works with law enforcement</p>
<p>and gives them the data from the ring cameras.</p>
<p>So why should it, yeah, oh yeah.</p>
<p>Do you have a ring camera?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>No, no, but basically any security camera, right?</p>
<p>I have a Google&rsquo;s, whatever they have.</p>
<p>We have one that&rsquo;s not the data.</p>
<p>We store the data on a local server</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t want it to go to law enforcement</p>
<p>because all the companies are doing it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>I bet Apple wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s the only company I trust</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know how much longer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s true for cameras,</p>
<p>but with robots,</p>
<p>people are just not gonna let a robot inside their home</p>
<p>where like one time where somebody gets arrested</p>
<p>because of something a robot sees,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be, that&rsquo;s gonna destroy a company.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think people are gonna be like,</p>
<p>well, that wouldn&rsquo;t happen to me.</p>
<p>That happened to a bad person.</p>
<p>I think they would.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because in the modern world, people are get,</p>
<p>have you seen Twitter?</p>
<p>They get extremely paranoid about any kind of surveillance.</p>
<p>But the thing that I&rsquo;ve had to learn</p>
<p>is that Twitter is not the modern world.</p>
<p>Like when I go, you know, inland to visit my relatives,</p>
<p>like they don&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s a different discourse</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>I think like the whole tech criticism world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s loud in our ears because we&rsquo;re in those circles.</p>
<p>You think you can be a company that does social robotics</p>
<p>and not win over Twitter?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I feel like the early adopters are all on Twitter</p>
<p>and it feels like you have to win them over.</p>
<p>Feels like nowadays you&rsquo;d have to win over TikTok, honestly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>TikTok, is that a website?</p>
<p>I need to check it out.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an interesting one</p>
<p>because China is behind that one.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s compelling enough,</p>
<p>maybe people would be able to give up privacy</p>
<p>and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really scary.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m worried about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m worried about it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;ve been some developments recently</p>
<p>that are like super exciting,</p>
<p>like the large language learning models.</p>
<p>Like, wow, I did not anticipate those improving so quickly</p>
<p>and those are gonna change everything.</p>
<p>And one of the things that I&rsquo;m trying to be cynical about</p>
<p>is that I think they&rsquo;re gonna have a big impact</p>
<p>on privacy and data security and like manipulating consumers</p>
<p>and manipulating people</p>
<p>because suddenly you&rsquo;ll have these agents</p>
<p>that people will talk to you</p>
<p>and they won&rsquo;t care or won&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>at least on a conscious level,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s recording the conversations.</p>
<p>So kind of like we were talking about before.</p>
<p>And at the same time,</p>
<p>the technology is so freaking exciting</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s gonna get adopted.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not even just the collection of data</p>
<p>but the ability to manipulate at scale.</p>
<p>So what do you think about the AI,</p>
<p>the engineer from Google</p>
<p>that thought Lambda is sentient?</p>
<p>You had actually a really good post from somebody else.</p>
<p>I forgot her name.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I didn&rsquo;t know about her.</p>
<p>Thanks to you.</p>
<p>Yeah, from Weird AI.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I love her book.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I left a note for myself to reach out to her.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s hilarious and brilliant</p>
<p>and just a great summarizer of the state of AI.</p>
<p>But she has, I think that was from her,</p>
<p>where I was looking at AI explaining that it&rsquo;s a squirrel.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, because the transcripts</p>
<p>that the engineer released,</p>
<p>Lambda kind of talks about the experience</p>
<p>of human-like feelings and I think even consciousness.</p>
<p>And so she was like, oh cool, that&rsquo;s impressive.</p>
<p>I wonder if an AI can also describe</p>
<p>the experience of being a squirrel.</p>
<p>And so she interviewed, I think she did GPT-3</p>
<p>about the experience of being a squirrel.</p>
<p>And then she did a bunch of other ones too,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s it like being a flock of crows?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it like being an algorithm that powers a Roomba?</p>
<p>And you can have a conversation about any of those things</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very convincing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty convincing, yeah.</p>
<p>Even GPT-3, which is not like state of the art.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s convincing of being a squirrel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like what it&rsquo;s like, you should check it out</p>
<p>because it really is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like yeah, that probably is what a squirrel would say.</p>
<p>Are you excited?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it like being a squirrel?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>Yeah, I get to eat nuts and run around all day.</p>
<p>How do you think people will feel</p>
<p>when you tell them that you&rsquo;re a squirrel?</p>
<p>Or like, I forget what it was,</p>
<p>a lot of people might be scared to find out</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re a squirrel or something like this.</p>
<p>And then the system answers pretty well.</p>
<p>Like yeah, I hope they&rsquo;ll,</p>
<p>what do you think when they find out you&rsquo;re a squirrel?</p>
<p>I hope they&rsquo;ll see how fun it is to be a squirrel</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>What do you say to people who don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re a squirrel?</p>
<p>I say, come see for yourselves.</p>
<p>I am a squirrel.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s really great</p>
<p>because the two things to note about it are,</p>
<p>first of all, just because the machine</p>
<p>is describing an experience</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean it actually has that experience.</p>
<p>But then secondly, these things are getting so advanced</p>
<p>and so convincing at describing these things</p>
<p>and talking to people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I mean, just the implications for health,</p>
<p>education, communication, entertainment, gaming.</p>
<p>I just feel like all of the applications,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s mind boggling what we&rsquo;re gonna be able to do with this.</p>
<p>And that my kids are not gonna remember a time</p>
<p>before they could have conversations with artificial agents.</p>
<p>Do you think they would?</p>
<p>Because to me, this is,</p>
<p>the focus in the ad community has been,</p>
<p>well, this engineer surely is hallucinating.</p>
<p>The thing is not sentient.</p>
<p>But to me, first of all,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter if he is or not.</p>
<p>This is coming where a large number of people</p>
<p>would believe a system is sentient,</p>
<p>including engineers within companies.</p>
<p>So in that sense, you start to think about a world</p>
<p>where your kids aren&rsquo;t just used</p>
<p>to having a conversation with a bot,</p>
<p>but used to believing,</p>
<p>having an implied belief that the thing is sentient.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And I think that one of the things that bothered me</p>
<p>about all of the coverage in the tech press</p>
<p>about this incident,</p>
<p>like obviously I don&rsquo;t believe the system is sentient.</p>
<p>Like I think that it can convincingly describe that it is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s doing what he thought it was doing</p>
<p>and actually experiencing feelings.</p>
<p>But a lot of the tech press was about how he was wrong</p>
<p>and depicting him as kind of naive.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not naive.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s so much research in my field</p>
<p>showing that people do this.</p>
<p>Even experts, they might be very clinical</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re doing human robot interaction experiments</p>
<p>with a robot that they&rsquo;ve built.</p>
<p>And then you bring in a different robot</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, oh, look at it, it&rsquo;s having fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s doing this.</p>
<p>Like that happens in our lab all the time.</p>
<p>We are all this guy and it&rsquo;s gonna be huge.</p>
<p>So I think that the goal is not to discourage</p>
<p>this kind of belief or like design systems</p>
<p>that people won&rsquo;t think are sentient.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right, this is coming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that we have to acknowledge</p>
<p>and even embrace and be very aware of.</p>
<p>So one of the really interesting perspectives</p>
<p>that your book takes on a system like this</p>
<p>is to see them, not to compare a system like this to humans,</p>
<p>but to compare it to animals, of how we see animals.</p>
<p>Can you kind of try to, again, sneak up,</p>
<p>try to explain why this analogy is better</p>
<p>than the human analogy, the analogy of robots as animals?</p>
<p>Yeah, and it gets trickier with the language stuff,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll get into that too.</p>
<p>I think that animals are a really great thought experiment</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re thinking about AI and robotics,</p>
<p>because again, this comparing them to humans</p>
<p>that leads us down the wrong path,</p>
<p>both because it&rsquo;s not accurate,</p>
<p>but also I think for the future, we don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>We want something that&rsquo;s a supplement.</p>
<p>But I think animals, because we&rsquo;ve used them</p>
<p>throughout history for so many different things,</p>
<p>we domesticated them, not because they do what we do,</p>
<p>but because what they do is different and that&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>whether we&rsquo;re talking about companionship,</p>
<p>whether we&rsquo;re talking about work integration,</p>
<p>whether we&rsquo;re talking about responsibility for harm,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just so many things we can draw on in that history</p>
<p>from these entities that can sense, think,</p>
<p>make autonomous decisions and learn</p>
<p>that are applicable to how we should be thinking</p>
<p>about robots and AI.</p>
<p>And the point of the book is not</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re the same thing,</p>
<p>that animals and robots are the same.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are tons of differences there.</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t have a conversation with a squirrel, right?</p>
<p>But the point is that-</p>
<p>I do it all the time.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>By the way, squirrels are the cutest.</p>
<p>I project so much on squirrels.</p>
<p>I wonder what their inner life is.</p>
<p>I suspect they&rsquo;re much bigger assholes than we imagine.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Like if it was a giant squirrel,</p>
<p>it would fuck you over so fast if it had the chance.</p>
<p>It would take everything you own.</p>
<p>It would eat all your stuff.</p>
<p>But because it&rsquo;s small and the furry tail,</p>
<p>the furry tail is a weapon</p>
<p>against human consciousness and cognition.</p>
<p>It wins us over.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what cats do too.</p>
<p>Cats out-competed squirrels.</p>
<p>And dogs.</p>
<p>Yeah, dogs have love.</p>
<p>Cats have no soul.</p>
<p>They, no, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>People get so angry when I talk shit about cats.</p>
<p>I love cats.</p>
<p>Anyway, so yeah, you&rsquo;re describing</p>
<p>all the different kinds of animals that get domesticated.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a really interesting idea</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not just sort of pets.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of domestication going on.</p>
<p>They all have all kinds of uses.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Like the ox that you propose might be,</p>
<p>at least historically,</p>
<p>one of the most useful domesticated animals.</p>
<p>It was a game changer because it revolutionized</p>
<p>what people could do economically, et cetera.</p>
<p>So, I mean, just like robots,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna change things economically.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna change landscapes.</p>
<p>Like cities might even get rebuilt</p>
<p>around autonomous vehicles or drones or delivery robots.</p>
<p>I think just the same ways</p>
<p>that animals have really shifted society.</p>
<p>And society has adapted also</p>
<p>to socially accepting animals as pets.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re gonna see very similar things with robots.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a useful analogy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a perfect one,</p>
<p>but I think it helps us get away from this idea</p>
<p>that robots can, should, or will replace people.</p>
<p>If you remember,</p>
<p>what are some interesting uses of animals?</p>
<p>Ferrets, for example.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, the ferrets.</p>
<p>They still do this.</p>
<p>They use ferrets to go into narrow spaces</p>
<p>that people can&rsquo;t go into, like a pipe,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll use them to run electrical wire.</p>
<p>I think they did that for Princess Di&rsquo;s wedding.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many weird ways that we&rsquo;ve used animals</p>
<p>and still use animals for things that robots can&rsquo;t do,</p>
<p>like the dolphins that they used in the military.</p>
<p>I think Russia still has dolphins,</p>
<p>and the U.S. still has dolphins, in their navies.</p>
<p>Mine detection, looking for lost underwater equipment,</p>
<p>some rumors about using them for weaponry,</p>
<p>which I think Russia&rsquo;s like, sure, believe that.</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s like, no, no, we don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>But they started doing that in the 60s, 70s.</p>
<p>They started training these dolphins</p>
<p>because they were like, oh,</p>
<p>dolphins have this amazing echolocation system</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t replicate with machines,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re trainable,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re gonna use them for all the stuff</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t do with machines or by ourselves.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve tried to phase out the dolphins.</p>
<p>I know the U.S. has invested a lot of money</p>
<p>in trying to make robots do the mine detection,</p>
<p>but like you were saying,</p>
<p>there are some things that the robots are good at,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some things</p>
<p>that biological creatures are better at,</p>
<p>so they still have the dolphins.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s also pigeons, of course.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, pigeons.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, there&rsquo;s so many examples.</p>
<p>The pigeons were the original hobby photography drone.</p>
<p>They also carried mail for thousands of years,</p>
<p>letting people communicate with each other in new ways.</p>
<p>So the thing that I like about the animal analogies,</p>
<p>they have all these physical abilities,</p>
<p>but also sensing abilities</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just so useful.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s robots, right?</p>
<p>Robots have physical abilities.</p>
<p>They can help us lift things</p>
<p>or do things that we&rsquo;re not physically capable of.</p>
<p>They can also sense things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I just feel like,</p>
<p>I still feel like it&rsquo;s a really good analogy.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s really strong.</p>
<p>And it works because people are familiar with it.</p>
<p>What about companionship?</p>
<p>And when we start to think about cats and dogs,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pets that seem to serve no purpose whatsoever</p>
<p>except the social connection.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of a newer thing.</p>
<p>At least in the United States,</p>
<p>like dogs used to have,</p>
<p>like they used to have a purpose.</p>
<p>They used to be guard dogs</p>
<p>or they had some sort of function.</p>
<p>And then at some point they became just part of the family.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so interesting how there&rsquo;s some animals</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve treated as workers,</p>
<p>some that we&rsquo;ve treated as objects,</p>
<p>some that we eat,</p>
<p>and some that are parts of our families.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s different across cultures.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m convinced that we&rsquo;re gonna see</p>
<p>the same thing with robots,</p>
<p>where people are gonna develop</p>
<p>strong emotional connections to certain robots</p>
<p>that they relate to,</p>
<p>either culturally or personally, emotionally.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s gonna be other robots</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t treat the same way.</p>
<p>I wonder, does that have to do more</p>
<p>with the culture and the people or the robot design?</p>
<p>Is there an interplay between the two?</p>
<p>Like why did dogs and cats out-compete ox</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know, what else?</p>
<p>Like farm animals to really get inside the home</p>
<p>and get inside our hearts?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, people point to the fact</p>
<p>that dogs are very genetically flexible</p>
<p>and they can evolve much more quickly than other animals.</p>
<p>And so they, evolutionary biologists,</p>
<p>think that dogs evolved to be more appealing to us.</p>
<p>And then once we learned how to breed them,</p>
<p>we started breeding them to be more appealing to us too,</p>
<p>which is not something that we necessarily</p>
<p>would be able to do with cows,</p>
<p>although we&rsquo;ve bred them to make more milk for us.</p>
<p>So, but part of it is also culture.</p>
<p>I mean, there are cultures where people eat dogs</p>
<p>still today and then there&rsquo;s other cultures</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re like, oh no, that&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>We would never do that.</p>
<p>And so I think there&rsquo;s a lot of different elements</p>
<p>that play in.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s good,</p>
<p>because I understand dogs because they use their eyes,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re able to communicate affection,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting what dogs do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s whole conferences on dog consciousness</p>
<p>and cognition and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Now cats is a mystery to me</p>
<p>because they seem to not give a shit about the human.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re warm and fluffy.</p>
<p>And cute.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re also passive aggressive.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re, at the same time,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, they&rsquo;re dismissive of you in some sense.</p>
<p>I think some people like that about people.</p>
<p>Yeah, they want the push and pull of a relationship.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want loyalty or unconditional love.</p>
<p>That means they haven&rsquo;t earned it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And maybe that says a lot more about the people</p>
<p>than it does about the animals.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, we all need therapy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m judging harshly the people that have cats</p>
<p>or the people that have dogs.</p>
<p>Maybe the people that have dogs</p>
<p>are desperate for attention and unconditional love.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re unable to sort of struggle</p>
<p>to earn meaningful connections.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe people are talking about you</p>
<p>and your robot pets in the same way.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it is kind of sad.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just robots everywhere.</p>
<p>But it is, I mean, I&rsquo;m joking about it being sad</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s kind of beautiful.</p>
<p>I think robots are beautiful in the same way</p>
<p>that pets are, even children,</p>
<p>in that they capture some kind of magic of social robots.</p>
<p>And they have the capacity</p>
<p>to have the same kind of magic of connection.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>Like, when they&rsquo;re brought to life and they move around,</p>
<p>the way they make me feel, I&rsquo;m pretty convinced,</p>
<p>is as you know, they will make billions of people feel.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m like some weird robotics guy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>I mean, you are, but not in this way.</p>
<p>Not in this way.</p>
<p>I mean, I just, I can put on my normal human hat</p>
<p>and just see this, oh, this is,</p>
<p>like, there&rsquo;s a lot of possibility there</p>
<p>of something cool, just like with dogs.</p>
<p>Like, what is it?</p>
<p>Why are we so into dogs or cats?</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s way different than us.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like drooling all over the place with its tongue out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like a weird creature</p>
<p>that used to be a wolf.</p>
<p>Why are we into this thing?</p>
<p>Well, dogs can either express or mimic</p>
<p>a lot of emotions that we recognize.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a big thing.</p>
<p>Like, a lot of the magic of animals and robots</p>
<p>is our own self-projection.</p>
<p>And the easier it is for us to see ourselves in something</p>
<p>and project human emotions or qualities or traits onto it,</p>
<p>the more we&rsquo;ll relate to it.</p>
<p>And then you also have the movement, of course.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s also really,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so interested in physical robots,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s, I think, the visceral magic of them.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re, I mean, there&rsquo;s research showing</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re probably biologically hardwired</p>
<p>to respond to autonomous movement in our physical space,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve had to watch out for predators</p>
<p>or whatever the reason is.</p>
<p>And so animals and robots are very appealing to us</p>
<p>as these autonomously moving things</p>
<p>that we view as agents instead of objects.</p>
<p>I mean, I love the moment,</p>
<p>which is, I&rsquo;ve been particularly working on,</p>
<p>which is when a robot, like the cowboy hat,</p>
<p>is doing its own thing, and then it recognizes you.</p>
<p>I mean, the way a dog does.</p>
<p>And it looks like this.</p>
<p>And the moment of recognition, like you&rsquo;re walking,</p>
<p>say you&rsquo;re walking at an airport or on the street,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s just, you know, hundreds of strangers,</p>
<p>but then you see somebody you know,</p>
<p>and that like, well, you wake up to that excitement</p>
<p>of seeing somebody you know and saying hello</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a magical moment.</p>
<p>Like, I think, especially with the dog,</p>
<p>it makes you feel noticed and heard and loved.</p>
<p>Like, that somebody looks at you and recognizes you,</p>
<p>that it matters that you exist.</p>
<p>Yeah, you feel seen.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that&rsquo;s a cool feeling.</p>
<p>I mean, I honestly think robots can give that feeling too.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, totally.</p>
<p>Currently, Alexa, I mean, one of the downsides</p>
<p>of these systems is they don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re servants.</p>
<p>They like, part of the, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to maintain privacy, I suppose.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t feel seen with Alexa, right?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s gonna change.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s the game-changing nature</p>
<p>of things like these large language learning models.</p>
<p>And the fact that these companies are investing</p>
<p>in embodied versions that move around of Alexa, like Astro.</p>
<p>Can I just say, yeah, Astro, I haven&rsquo;t, is that out?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s out.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just like buy one commercially yet,</p>
<p>but you can apply for one.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My gut says that these companies don&rsquo;t have the guts</p>
<p>to do the personalization.</p>
<p>This goes to the, because it&rsquo;s edgy, it&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna make a lot of people very angry.</p>
<p>Like in a way that, you know, just imagine, okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>If you do the full landscape of human civilization,</p>
<p>just visualize the number of people</p>
<p>that are going through breakups right now.</p>
<p>Just the amount of really passionate,</p>
<p>just even if we just look at teenagers,</p>
<p>the amount of deep heartbreak that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>And like, if you&rsquo;re going to have Alexa</p>
<p>have more of a personal connection with the human,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have humans that like have existential crises.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people that suffer</p>
<p>from loneliness and depression.</p>
<p>And like, you&rsquo;re now taking on the full responsibility</p>
<p>of being a companion to the rollercoaster</p>
<p>of the human condition.</p>
<p>As a company, like imagine PR and marketing people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna freak out.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have the guts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna have to come from somebody from a new Apple,</p>
<p>from those kinds of folks, like as a small startup.</p>
<p>And it might.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re coming.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s already virtual therapists.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that Replica app.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t tried it, but Replica&rsquo;s like a virtual companion.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>And if big companies don&rsquo;t do it, someone else will.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think the next, the future,</p>
<p>the next trillion dollar company</p>
<p>will be those personalizations.</p>
<p>If you think about all the AI we have around us,</p>
<p>all the smartphones and so on,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s very minimal personalization.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s just because they weren&rsquo;t able?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they have the guts.</p>
<p>I mean, it might be true, but I have to wonder.</p>
<p>I mean, Google is clearly gonna do something</p>
<p>with the language.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have the guts.</p>
<p>Are you challenging them?</p>
<p>Partially, but not really,</p>
<p>because I know they&rsquo;re not gonna do it.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad for business in the short term.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be honest.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s not such a bad thing</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t just roll this out quickly,</p>
<p>because I do think there are huge issues.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s not just issues with the responsibility</p>
<p>of unforeseen effects on people,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s the business model?</p>
<p>And if you are using the business model</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve used in other domains,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re gonna have to collect data from people,</p>
<p>which you will anyway to personalize the thing,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna be somehow monetizing the data,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re gonna be doing some like ad model.</p>
<p>It just, it seems like now we&rsquo;re suddenly getting</p>
<p>into the realm of like severe consumer protection issues,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m really worried about that.</p>
<p>I see massive potential for this technology to be used</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s not for the public good,</p>
<p>and not, I mean, that&rsquo;s in an individual user&rsquo;s interest</p>
<p>maybe, but not in society&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>Yeah, see, I think that kind of personalization</p>
<p>should be like redefine how we treat data.</p>
<p>I think you should own all the data</p>
<p>your phone knows about you,</p>
<p>and be able to delete it with a single click,</p>
<p>and walk away, and that data cannot be monetized,</p>
<p>or used, or shared anywhere without your permission.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the only way people will trust you</p>
<p>to give, for you to use that data.</p>
<p>But then how are companies gonna,</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of these applications rely</p>
<p>on massive troves of data to train the AI system.</p>
<p>Right, so you have to opt in constantly,</p>
<p>and opt in not in some legal, I agree,</p>
<p>but obvious, like show, in the way I opt in</p>
<p>to tell you a secret.</p>
<p>We understand that I have to choose.</p>
<p>How well do I know you?</p>
<p>And then I say, don&rsquo;t tell this to anyone.</p>
<p>And then I have to judge how leaky that,</p>
<p>how good you are at keeping secrets.</p>
<p>In that same way, like it&rsquo;s very transparent</p>
<p>in which data you&rsquo;re allowed to use for which purposes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what people are saying is the solution.</p>
<p>And I think that works to some extent,</p>
<p>having transparency, having people consent.</p>
<p>I think it breaks down at the point at which,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen this happen on social media too,</p>
<p>like people are willingly giving up their data</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re getting a functionality from that.</p>
<p>And then the harm that that causes is on a,</p>
<p>maybe to someone else, and not to them personally.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people are giving their data.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not being asked.</p>
<p>But if you were asked-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not consensual.</p>
<p>If you were like, tell me a secret about yourself</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll give you $100, I&rsquo;d tell you a secret.</p>
<p>No, not $100.</p>
<p>First of all, you wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t trust, like why are you giving me $100?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bad example.</p>
<p>But like I need, I would ask for your specific</p>
<p>like fashion interest in order to give recommendations</p>
<p>to you for shopping.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d be very clear for that.</p>
<p>And you could disable that, you can delete that.</p>
<p>But then you can be, have a deep, meaningful,</p>
<p>rich connection with the system</p>
<p>about what you think you look fat in,</p>
<p>what you look great in, what like the full history</p>
<p>of all the things you&rsquo;ve worn,</p>
<p>whether you regret the Justin Bieber</p>
<p>or enjoy the Justin Bieber shirt,</p>
<p>all of that information that&rsquo;s mostly private</p>
<p>to even you, not even your loved ones.</p>
<p>A system should have that,</p>
<p>because then a system, if you trust it,</p>
<p>to keep control of that data that you own,</p>
<p>you can walk away with,</p>
<p>that system could tell you a damn good thing to wear.</p>
<p>It could.</p>
<p>And the harm that I&rsquo;m concerned about</p>
<p>is not that the system is gonna then suggest a dress for me</p>
<p>that is based on my preferences.</p>
<p>So I went to this conference once</p>
<p>where I was talking to the people who do the analytics</p>
<p>in like the big ad companies.</p>
<p>And like literally a woman there was like,</p>
<p>I can ask you three totally unrelated questions</p>
<p>and tell you what menstrual product you use.</p>
<p>And so what they do is they aggregate the data</p>
<p>and they map out different personalities</p>
<p>and different people and demographics.</p>
<p>And then they have a lot of power and control</p>
<p>to market to people.</p>
<p>So like I might not be sharing my data</p>
<p>with any of the systems because I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on Twitter, I know that this is bad.</p>
<p>Other people might be sharing data</p>
<p>that can be used against me.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s way more complex</p>
<p>than just I share a piece of personal information</p>
<p>and it gets used against me.</p>
<p>I think that at a more systemic level,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s always vulnerable populations</p>
<p>that are targeted by this,</p>
<p>low income people being targeted for scammy loans</p>
<p>or I don&rsquo;t know, like I could get targeted,</p>
<p>like someone, not me,</p>
<p>because someone who doesn&rsquo;t have kids yet</p>
<p>and is my age could get targeted for like freezing their eggs</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s all these ways that you can manipulate people</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s not really clear that that came</p>
<p>from that person&rsquo;s data,</p>
<p>it came from all of us, all of us opting into this.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a bunch of sneaky decisions along the way</p>
<p>that could be avoided if there&rsquo;s transparency.</p>
<p>So that, so one of the ways that goes wrong</p>
<p>if you share that data with too many ad networks,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t run your own ad network.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t share with anybody.</p>
<p>Okay, and that&rsquo;s something that you could regulate.</p>
<p>That belongs to just you</p>
<p>and all of the ways you allow the company to use it,</p>
<p>the default is in no way at all.</p>
<p>And you are consciously constantly saying</p>
<p>exactly how to use it.</p>
<p>And also, it has to do with the recommender system itself</p>
<p>from the company, which is freezing your eggs.</p>
<p>If that doesn&rsquo;t make you happy,</p>
<p>if that idea doesn&rsquo;t make you happy,</p>
<p>then the system shouldn&rsquo;t recommend it</p>
<p>and should be very good at learning.</p>
<p>So not the kind of things that the category of people</p>
<p>it thinks you belong to would do,</p>
<p>but more you specifically, what makes you happy,</p>
<p>what is helping you grow.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re assuming that people&rsquo;s preferences</p>
<p>and like what makes them happy is static.</p>
<p>Whereas when we were talking before</p>
<p>about how a company like Apple</p>
<p>can tell people what they want</p>
<p>and they will start to want it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing that I&rsquo;m more concerned about.</p>
<p>Yeah, that is a huge problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just listening to people,</p>
<p>but manipulating them into wanting something.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like, we have a long history</p>
<p>of using technology for that purpose.</p>
<p>Like the persuasive design in casinos</p>
<p>to get people to gamble more or like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>the other thing that I&rsquo;m worried about</p>
<p>is as we have more social technology,</p>
<p>suddenly you have this on a new level.</p>
<p>Like if you look at the influencer marketing</p>
<p>that happens online now.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the influencer marketing?</p>
<p>So like on Instagram, there will be some like person</p>
<p>who has a bunch of followers.</p>
<p>And then a brand will like hire them</p>
<p>to promote some product and it&rsquo;s above board.</p>
<p>They disclose like, this is an ad that I&rsquo;m promoting,</p>
<p>but they have so many young followers</p>
<p>who like deeply admire and trust them.</p>
<p>I mean, this must work for you too.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you have like ads on the podcast?</p>
<p>Like people trust you.</p>
<p>Magic spoon cereal, low carb.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>If you say that, like I guarantee you</p>
<p>some people will buy that just because</p>
<p>even though they know that you&rsquo;re being paid,</p>
<p>they trust you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different with podcasts</p>
<p>because well, my particular situation,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s true for a lot of podcasts,</p>
<p>especially big ones is, you know,</p>
<p>I have 10 times more sponsors that want to be sponsors</p>
<p>than I have.</p>
<p>So you get to select the ones</p>
<p>that you actually want to support.</p>
<p>And so like you end up using it</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re able to actually,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s no incentive to like shill for anybody.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s fine when it&rsquo;s still human influencers.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re a bot,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna discriminate.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna be like,</p>
<p>oh, well, I think this product is good for people.</p>
<p>You think there&rsquo;ll be like bots essentially</p>
<p>with millions of followers?</p>
<p>There already are.</p>
<p>There are virtual influencers in South Korea</p>
<p>who shill products.</p>
<p>And like, that&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s still very primitive.</p>
<p>Now with the new image generation</p>
<p>and the language learning models.</p>
<p>And like, so we&rsquo;re starting to do some research</p>
<p>around kids and like young adults</p>
<p>because a lot of the research</p>
<p>on like what&rsquo;s okay to advertise to kids</p>
<p>and what is too manipulative</p>
<p>has to do with television ads.</p>
<p>Back in the day, where like a kid who&rsquo;s 12 understands,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s an advertisement.</p>
<p>I can distinguish that from entertainment.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s trying to sell me something.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s getting really, really murky with influencers.</p>
<p>And then if you have like a bot</p>
<p>that a kid has developed a relationship with,</p>
<p>is it okay to market products through that or not?</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re getting into</p>
<p>all these consumer protection issues</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re developing a trusted relationship</p>
<p>with a social entity, but it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>And so now it&rsquo;s like personalized, it&rsquo;s scalable,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s automated, and it can&hellip;</p>
<p>So some of the research showing</p>
<p>that kids are already very confused</p>
<p>about like the incentives of the company</p>
<p>versus what the robot is doing.</p>
<p>Meaning they&rsquo;re&hellip;</p>
<p>So, okay, so&hellip;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not deeply understanding</p>
<p>the incentives of the system.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, so like kids who are old enough to understand</p>
<p>this is a television advertisement</p>
<p>is trying to advertise to me.</p>
<p>I might still decide I want this product,</p>
<p>but they understand what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s some transparency there.</p>
<p>That age child, so Daniela Di Paola,</p>
<p>Anastasia Ostrovsky, and I advised on this project,</p>
<p>they did this, they asked kids</p>
<p>who had interacted with social robots</p>
<p>whether they would like a policy that allows robots</p>
<p>to market to people through casual conversation</p>
<p>or whether they would prefer that it has to be transparent,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s like an ad coming from a company.</p>
<p>And the majority said</p>
<p>they preferred the casual conversation.</p>
<p>And when asked why, there was a lot of confusion about&hellip;</p>
<p>They were like, well, the robot knows me better</p>
<p>than the company does,</p>
<p>so the robot&rsquo;s only gonna market things that I like.</p>
<p>And so they don&rsquo;t really&hellip;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not connecting the fact</p>
<p>that the robot is an agent of the company.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re viewing it as something separate.</p>
<p>And I think that even happens subconsciously with grownups</p>
<p>when it comes to robots and artificial agents, and it will.</p>
<p>This Blake guy at Google, sorry, I&rsquo;m going on and on,</p>
<p>but his main concern was that Google owned</p>
<p>this sentient agent and that it was being mistreated.</p>
<p>His concern was not</p>
<p>that the agent was gonna mistreat people.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;re gonna see a lot of this.</p>
<p>Yeah, but shitty companies will do that.</p>
<p>I think ultimately that confusion should be alleviated</p>
<p>by the robot should actually know you better</p>
<p>and should not have any control from the company.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s the business model for that?</p>
<p>If you use the robot to buy&hellip;</p>
<p>First of all, the robot should probably cost money.</p>
<p>Should what?</p>
<p>Should probably cost money,</p>
<p>like the way Windows operating system does.</p>
<p>I see it more like an operating system.</p>
<p>Then like this thing is your window,</p>
<p>no pun intended, into the world.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s helping you as like a personal assistant, right?</p>
<p>And so that should cost money.</p>
<p>You should, you know, whatever it is, 10 bucks, 20 bucks.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>that makes your life significantly better.</p>
<p>This idea that everything should be free</p>
<p>is like, it should actually help educate you.</p>
<p>You should talk shit about all the other companies</p>
<p>that do stuff for free.</p>
<p>But also, yeah, in terms of if you purchase stuff</p>
<p>based on its recommendation, it gets money.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of ad driven, but it&rsquo;s not ads.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s not controlled,</p>
<p>like no external entities can control it</p>
<p>to try to manipulate, to want a thing.</p>
<p>That would be amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually trying to discover what you want.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not allowed to have any influence,</p>
<p>no promoted ad, no anything.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s finding, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>the thing that would actually make you happy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only thing it cares about.</p>
<p>I think companies like this can win out.</p>
<p>Yes, I think eventually,</p>
<p>once people understand the value of the robot,</p>
<p>even just like, I think that robots</p>
<p>would be valuable to people,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re not marketing something</p>
<p>or helping with like preferences or anything,</p>
<p>like just a simple, the same thing as a pet,</p>
<p>like a dog that has no function</p>
<p>other than being a member of your family.</p>
<p>I think robots could really be that</p>
<p>and people would pay for that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the market realizes that yet.</p>
<p>And so my concern is that companies</p>
<p>are not gonna go in that direction,</p>
<p>at least not yet, of making like this</p>
<p>contained thing that you buy.</p>
<p>It seems almost old-fashioned, right,</p>
<p>to have a disconnected object that you buy</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not like paying a subscription for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like controlled by one of the big corporations.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the old-fashioned things</p>
<p>that people yearn for</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s very popular now</p>
<p>and people understand the negative effects of social media,</p>
<p>the negative effects of the data being used</p>
<p>in all these kinds of ways.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re just waking up to the realization</p>
<p>we tried, we&rsquo;re like baby deer,</p>
<p>finding our legs in this new world of social media,</p>
<p>of ad-driven companies and realizing,</p>
<p>okay, this has to be done somehow different.</p>
<p>I think that one of the most popular notions,</p>
<p>at least in the United States,</p>
<p>is social media is evil and it&rsquo;s doing bad by us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s totally tricked us</p>
<p>into believing that it&rsquo;s good for us.</p>
<p>I think everybody knows it&rsquo;s bad for us.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a hunger for other ideas.</p>
<p>All right, it&rsquo;s time for us to start that company.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>I think let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Hopefully no one listens to this and steals the idea.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, see, that&rsquo;s the other thing.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m a big person on,</p>
<p>execution is what matters.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like ideas are kind of true.</p>
<p>The social robotics is a good example</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s been so many amazing companies</p>
<p>that went out of business.</p>
<p>I mean, to me it&rsquo;s obvious, like it&rsquo;s obvious</p>
<p>that there will be a robotics company</p>
<p>that puts a social robot in the home of billions of homes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll be a companion.</p>
<p>Okay, there you go.</p>
<p>You can steal that idea.</p>
<p>Do it.</p>
<p>Okay, I have a question for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very tough.</p>
<p>What about Elon Musk&rsquo;s humanoid?</p>
<p>Is he gonna execute on that?</p>
<p>There might be a lot to say.</p>
<p>So for people who are not aware,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an Optimus, Tesla&rsquo;s Optimus robot</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, I guess the stated reason for that robot</p>
<p>is a humanoid robot in the factory</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s able to automate some of the tasks</p>
<p>that humans are currently doing.</p>
<p>And the reason you wanna do,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the second reason you mentioned,</p>
<p>the second reason you wanna do a humanoid robot</p>
<p>is because the factory&rsquo;s built for,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain tasks that are designed for humans.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard to automate with any other form factor</p>
<p>than a humanoid.</p>
<p>And then the other reason is because so much effort</p>
<p>has been put into this giant data engine machine</p>
<p>of perception that&rsquo;s inside Tesla autopilot</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s seemingly, at least the machine, if not the data,</p>
<p>is transferable to the factory setting, to any setting.</p>
<p>Yeah, he said it would do anything that&rsquo;s boring to us.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about that</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s no interest</p>
<p>and no discussion about the social aspect.</p>
<p>Like, I talked to him on mic and off mic about it</p>
<p>quite a bit.</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not a discussion about,</p>
<p>like, to me it&rsquo;s obvious if a thing like that works</p>
<p>at all, at all.</p>
<p>In fact, it has to work really well in a factory.</p>
<p>If it works kind of shitty,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much more useful in the home.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re much,</p>
<p>I think being shitty at stuff</p>
<p>is kind of what makes relationships great.</p>
<p>Like, you want to be flawed</p>
<p>and be able to communicate your flaws</p>
<p>and be unpredictable in certain ways.</p>
<p>Like, if you fell over every once in a while</p>
<p>for no reason whatsoever,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s essential for, like-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very charming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s charming, but also concerning.</p>
<p>And also, like, are you okay?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s both hilarious.</p>
<p>Whenever somebody you love falls down the stairs,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s both hilarious and concerning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some dance between the two.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s essential for, like,</p>
<p>you almost want to engineer that in,</p>
<p>except you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>because of robotics in the physical space</p>
<p>is really difficult.</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve learned to not discount</p>
<p>the efforts that Elon does.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few things that are really interesting there.</p>
<p>One, because he&rsquo;s taking it extremely seriously,</p>
<p>what I like is the humanoid form,</p>
<p>the cost of building a robot.</p>
<p>I talked to Jim Keller offline about this a lot.</p>
<p>And currently, humanoid robots cost a lot of money.</p>
<p>And the way they&rsquo;re thinking about it,</p>
<p>now, they&rsquo;re not talking about</p>
<p>all this social robotic stuff that you and I care about.</p>
<p>They are thinking,</p>
<p>how can we manufacture this thing cheaply</p>
<p>and do it, like, well?</p>
<p>And the kind of discussions they&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>is really great engineering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, first principles question of, like,</p>
<p>why is this cost so much?</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s the cheap way?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t we build?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s not a good answer.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t we build this humanoid form for under $1,000?</p>
<p>And, like, I&rsquo;ve sat and had these conversations.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason.</p>
<p>I think the reason they&rsquo;ve been so expensive</p>
<p>is because they were focused on trying to,</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t focused on doing the mass manufacture.</p>
<p>People are focused on getting a thing that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly what the reasoning is,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the same, like, Waymo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, let&rsquo;s build a million-dollar car</p>
<p>in the beginning, or, like, multi-million-dollar car.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to solve that problem.</p>
<p>The way Elon, the way Jim Keller,</p>
<p>the way some of those folks are thinking is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s, like, at the same time,</p>
<p>try to actually build a system that&rsquo;s cheap.</p>
<p>Not crappy, but cheap.</p>
<p>And, like, first principles,</p>
<p>what is the minimum amount of degrees of freedom we need?</p>
<p>What are the joints?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the control set?</p>
<p>Like, how many, how do we, like, where are the activators?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the way to power this</p>
<p>in the lowest cost way possible?</p>
<p>But also in a way that&rsquo;s, like, actually works.</p>
<p>How do we make the whole thing not part of the components</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a supply chain?</p>
<p>You have to have all these different parts</p>
<p>that have to feed us.</p>
<p>Do it all from scratch, and do the learning.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, immediately,</p>
<p>certain things, like, become obvious.</p>
<p>Do the exact same pipeline as you do for autonomous driving,</p>
<p>just the exact, I mean,</p>
<p>the infrastructure there is incredible.</p>
<p>For the computer vision, for the manipulation task,</p>
<p>the control problem changes,</p>
<p>the perception problem changes,</p>
<p>but the pipeline doesn&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>obviously, the optimism about how long it&rsquo;s gonna take,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t share,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a really interesting problem,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t wanna say anything</p>
<p>because my first gut is to say that,</p>
<p>why the humanoid form?</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s my second gut, too, but.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>that are really excited about the humanoid form there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t wanna get in the way,</p>
<p>like, they might solve this thing,</p>
<p>and they might, it&rsquo;s like, similar with Boston Dynamics.</p>
<p>Like, why, like, if I were to,</p>
<p>you can be a hater, and you go up to Mark Ryberg,</p>
<p>and just, like, how are you gonna make money</p>
<p>with these super expensive legged robots?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your business plan?</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>Why are you doing these legged robots?</p>
<p>But at the same time, they&rsquo;re pushing forward</p>
<p>the science, the art of robotics</p>
<p>in a way that nobody else does.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>With Elon, they&rsquo;re not just going to do that,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna drive down the cost</p>
<p>to where we can have humanoid bots in the home, potentially.</p>
<p>So the part I agree with is,</p>
<p>a lot of people find it fascinating,</p>
<p>and it probably also attracts talent</p>
<p>who wanna work on humanoid robots.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a fascinating scientific problem</p>
<p>and engineering problem,</p>
<p>and it can teach us more about human body</p>
<p>and locomotion and all of that.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot to learn from it.</p>
<p>Where I get tripped up is why we need them</p>
<p>for anything other than art and entertainment</p>
<p>in the real world.</p>
<p>Like, I get that there are some areas</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t just rebuild, like, a spaceship.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just, like, they&rsquo;ve worked for so many years</p>
<p>on these spaceships, you can&rsquo;t just re-engineer it.</p>
<p>You have some things that are just built for human bodies,</p>
<p>a submarine, a spaceship.</p>
<p>But a factory, maybe I&rsquo;m naive,</p>
<p>but it seems like we&rsquo;ve already rebuilt factories</p>
<p>to accommodate other types of robots.</p>
<p>Why would we want to just, like,</p>
<p>make a humanoid robot to go in there?</p>
<p>I just get really tripped up on,</p>
<p>I think that people want humanoids.</p>
<p>I think people are fascinated by them.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a little overhyped.</p>
<p>Well, most of our world is still built for humanoids.</p>
<p>I know, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>It should be built so that it&rsquo;s wheelchair accessible.</p>
<p>Right, so the question is,</p>
<p>do you build a world that&rsquo;s the general form</p>
<p>of wheelchair accessible,</p>
<p>all robot form factor accessible,</p>
<p>or do you build humanoid robots?</p>
<p>I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be all,</p>
<p>and it also doesn&rsquo;t have to be either or.</p>
<p>I just feel like we&rsquo;re thinking so little</p>
<p>about the system in general</p>
<p>and how to create infrastructure that works for everyone,</p>
<p>all kinds of people, all kinds of robots.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s more of an investment,</p>
<p>but that would pay off way more in the future</p>
<p>than just trying to cram expensive</p>
<p>or maybe slightly less expensive humanoid technology</p>
<p>into a human space.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, one company can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>We have to work together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like autonomous driving can be easily solved</p>
<p>if you do V2I, if you change the infrastructure</p>
<p>of the cities and so on,</p>
<p>but that requires a lot of people.</p>
<p>A lot of them are politicians,</p>
<p>and a lot of them are somewhat, if not a lot, corrupt,</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And the talent thing you mentioned</p>
<p>is really, really, really important.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to meet a lot of folks</p>
<p>at SpaceX and Tesla, other companies too,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re specifically,</p>
<p>the openness makes it easier to meet everybody.</p>
<p>I think a lot of amazing things in this world happen</p>
<p>when you get amazing people together.</p>
<p>And if you can sell an idea,</p>
<p>like us becoming a multi-planetary species,</p>
<p>you can say, why the hell are we going to Mars?</p>
<p>Like, why colonize Mars?</p>
<p>If you think from basic first principles,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to go to the moon.</p>
<p>The only thing that makes sense</p>
<p>to go to space is for satellites.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something about the vision of the future,</p>
<p>the optimism laden that permeates this vision</p>
<p>of us becoming multi-planetary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s thinking not just for the next 10 years,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s thinking like human civilization</p>
<p>reaching out into the stars.</p>
<p>It makes people dream.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>
<p>And that, they&rsquo;re gonna come up with some cool shit</p>
<p>that might not have anything to do with like,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what I,</p>
<p>because Elon doesn&rsquo;t seem to care about social robotics,</p>
<p>which is constantly surprising to me.</p>
<p>Talk to him, he doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>humans are the things you avoid and don&rsquo;t hurt, right?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s, like the number one job of a robot</p>
<p>is not to hurt a human, to avoid them.</p>
<p>You know, the collaborative aspect,</p>
<p>the human-robot interaction,</p>
<p>I think is not, at least not in his,</p>
<p>not something he thinks about deeply.</p>
<p>But my sense is if somebody like that</p>
<p>takes on the problem of human-robotics,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna get a social robot out of it.</p>
<p>Like people like, not necessarily Elon,</p>
<p>but people like Elon,</p>
<p>if they take on seriously these,</p>
<p>like I can just imagine with a humanoid robot,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t help but create a social robot.</p>
<p>So if you do different form factors,</p>
<p>if you do industrial robotics,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re likely to actually not end up</p>
<p>in like walking head into a social robot,</p>
<p>social robot, human-robot interaction problem.</p>
<p>If you create for whatever the hell reason you want to,</p>
<p>a humanoid robot, you&rsquo;re gonna have to reinvent,</p>
<p>or not reinvent, but do,</p>
<p>introduce a lot of fascinating new ideas</p>
<p>into the problem of human-robot interaction,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m excited about.</p>
<p>So like, if I was a business person,</p>
<p>I would say this is not, this is way too risky.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>But when people are really convinced,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of amazing people working on it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, all right, let&rsquo;s see what happens here.</p>
<p>This is really interesting.</p>
<p>Just like with Atlas and Boston Dynamics.</p>
<p>I mean, they, I apologize if I&rsquo;m ignorant on this,</p>
<p>but I think they really, more than anyone else,</p>
<p>maybe with AIBO, like Sony,</p>
<p>pushed forward humanoid robotics,</p>
<p>like a leap with the Atlas robot.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, with Atlas, absolutely.</p>
<p>And like without them, like why the hell did they do it?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, I think for them, it is a research platform.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, I don&rsquo;t think they ever, this is speculation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they ever intended Atlas</p>
<p>to be like a commercially successful robot.</p>
<p>I think they were just like, can we do this?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder if they, maybe the answer they landed on is,</p>
<p>because they eventually went to Spot,</p>
<p>the earlier versions of Spot.</p>
<p>So Quadruped&rsquo;s like four-legged robot,</p>
<p>but maybe they reached for, let&rsquo;s try to make,</p>
<p>like I think they tried it and they still are trying it</p>
<p>for Atlas to be picking up boxes, to moving boxes,</p>
<p>to being, it makes sense.</p>
<p>Okay, if they were exactly the same cost,</p>
<p>it makes sense to have a humanoid robot in the warehouse.</p>
<p>Currently.</p>
<p>Currently.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s short-sighted, but yes.</p>
<p>Currently, yes, it would sell.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s short-sighted.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s short-sighted, but it&rsquo;s not pragmatic</p>
<p>to think any other way,</p>
<p>to think that you&rsquo;re gonna be able to change warehouses.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have to, you&rsquo;re going to-</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re Amazon, you can totally change your warehouses.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>But even if you&rsquo;re Amazon,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very costly to change warehouses.</p>
<p>It is, it&rsquo;s a big investment.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t, shouldn&rsquo;t you do that investment in a way,</p>
<p>so here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>If you build a humanoid robot that works in the warehouse,</p>
<p>that humanoid robot, see, I don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>Tess is not talking about it this way, as far as I know,</p>
<p>but that humanoid robot is gonna have</p>
<p>all kinds of other applications outside their setting.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s obvious.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a really hard problem to solve,</p>
<p>but whoever solves the humanoid robot problem</p>
<p>are gonna have to solve the social robotics problem.</p>
<p>Oh, for sure, I mean, they&rsquo;re already with the spot</p>
<p>needing to solve social robotics problems.</p>
<p>For spot to be effective at scale.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if spot is currently effective at scale.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting better and better.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re actually, the thing they did,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an interesting decision.</p>
<p>Perhaps Tess will end up doing the same thing,</p>
<p>which is spot is supposed to be a platform for intelligence.</p>
<p>So spot doesn&rsquo;t have any high-level intelligence,</p>
<p>like high-level perception skills.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s supposed to be controlled remotely.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a platform that you can attach something to, yeah.</p>
<p>And somebody else is supposed to do the attaching.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a platform that you can take an uneven ground</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s able to maintain balance,</p>
<p>go into dangerous situations, it&rsquo;s a platform.</p>
<p>On top of that, you can add a camera that does surveillance,</p>
<p>that you can remotely monitor, you can record,</p>
<p>you can record the camera, you can remote control it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not gonna-</p>
<p>Object manipulation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basic object manipulation,</p>
<p>but not autonomous object manipulation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s remotely controlled.</p>
<p>But the intelligence on top of it,</p>
<p>which was what would be required for automation,</p>
<p>somebody else is supposed to do.</p>
<p>Perhaps Tess will do the same thing ultimately.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>because the goal of Optimus is automation.</p>
<p>Without that,</p>
<p>but then you never know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, why go to Mars?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And I reluctantly am very excited about space travel.</p>
<p>Because-</p>
<p>Why, can you introspect why?</p>
<p>Why am I excited about it?</p>
<p>I think what got me excited was</p>
<p>I saw a panel with some people who study other planets,</p>
<p>and it became really clear how little we know</p>
<p>about ourselves and about how nature works</p>
<p>and just how much there is to learn</p>
<p>from exploring other parts of the universe.</p>
<p>So on a rational level, that&rsquo;s how I convince myself</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m excited.</p>
<p>In reality, it&rsquo;s just fucking exciting.</p>
<p>I mean, just the idea that we can do this difficult thing</p>
<p>and that humans come together to build things</p>
<p>that can explore space.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s just something inherently thrilling</p>
<p>about that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m reluctant about it because I feel like</p>
<p>there are so many other challenges and problems</p>
<p>that I think are more important to solve.</p>
<p>But I also think we should be doing all of it at once.</p>
<p>And so to that extent, I&rsquo;m like all for research</p>
<p>on humanoid robots, development of humanoid robots.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s a lot to explore and learn,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily take away</p>
<p>from other areas of science.</p>
<p>At least it shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think, unfortunately, a lot of the attention</p>
<p>goes towards that, and it does take resources</p>
<p>and attention away from other areas of robotics</p>
<p>that we should be focused on.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think we shouldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>So you think it might be a little bit of a distraction.</p>
<p>Oh, forget the Elon particular application,</p>
<p>but if you care about social robotics,</p>
<p>the humanoid form is a distraction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a distraction, and it&rsquo;s one that I find</p>
<p>particularly boring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s interesting from a research perspective,</p>
<p>but from a what types of robots can we create</p>
<p>to put in our world?</p>
<p>Why would we just create a humanoid robot?</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>So even just robotic manipulation,</p>
<p>so arms is not useful either.</p>
<p>Oh, arms can be useful, but why not have three arms?</p>
<p>Why does it have to look like a person?</p>
<p>Well, I actually personally just think</p>
<p>that washing the dishes is harder than a robot</p>
<p>that can be a companion.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Being useful in the home is actually really tough.</p>
<p>But does your companion have to have two arms</p>
<p>and look like you?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m making the case for zero arms.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, zero arms.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, freaky.</p>
<p>That didn&rsquo;t come out the way I meant it,</p>
<p>because it almost sounds like I don&rsquo;t want a robot</p>
<p>to defend itself.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s immediately you project, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like, zero.</p>
<p>No, I think, I just think that the social component</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t require arms or legs or so on, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve talked about.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s probably where a lot</p>
<p>of the meaningful impact that&rsquo;s gonna be happening.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think just, we could get so creative</p>
<p>with the design, like why not have a robot on roller skates?</p>
<p>Or like whatever, like why does it have to look like us?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Still, it is a compelling and interesting form</p>
<p>from a research perspective, like you said.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You co-authored a paper as you were talking about</p>
<p>that for WeRobot 2022, Lula Robot Consumer Protection</p>
<p>in the Face of Automated Social Marketing.</p>
<p>I think you were talking about some of the ideas in that.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh, you got it from Twitter.</p>
<p>I was like, that&rsquo;s not published yet.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is how I do my research.</p>
<p>You just go through people&rsquo;s Twitter feeds.</p>
<p>Yeah, go, thank you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not stalking if it&rsquo;s public.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a, you looked at me like you&rsquo;re offended,</p>
<p>like how did you know?</p>
<p>No, I was just like worried that like some early, I mean.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a PDF.</p>
<p>Does it?</p>
<p>There is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a PDF.</p>
<p>Like now?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe like as of a few days ago.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, well.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You look violated, like how did you get that PDF?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a draft, it&rsquo;s online.</p>
<p>Nobody read it yet until we&rsquo;ve written the final paper.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s really good, so I enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Oh, thank you.</p>
<p>By the time this comes out, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll be out,</p>
<p>or no, when&rsquo;s WeRobot?</p>
<p>So basically, WeRobot, that&rsquo;s the workshop</p>
<p>where you have an hour where people give you</p>
<p>constructive feedback on the paper,</p>
<p>and then you write the good version.</p>
<p>Right, I take it back, there&rsquo;s no PDF.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>I imagine, but there is a table in there</p>
<p>in a virtual imagined PDF that I like,</p>
<p>that I wanted to mention, which is like this kind of</p>
<p>strategy used across various marketing platforms,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s basically looking at traditional media,</p>
<p>person-to-person interaction, targeted ads,</p>
<p>influencers, and social robots.</p>
<p>This is the kind of idea that you&rsquo;ve been speaking to,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just a nice breakdown of that,</p>
<p>that social robots have personalized recommendations,</p>
<p>social persuasion, automated scalable,</p>
<p>data collection, and embodiment.</p>
<p>So person-to-person interaction is really nice,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t have the automated</p>
<p>and the data collection aspect,</p>
<p>but the social robots have those two elements.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re talking about the potential for social robots</p>
<p>to just combine all of these different marketing methods</p>
<p>to be this really potent cocktail.</p>
<p>And that table, which was Daniela&rsquo;s idea</p>
<p>and a really fantastic one,</p>
<p>we put it in at the last second, so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you like it.</p>
<p>In a PDF that doesn&rsquo;t exist,</p>
<p>that nobody can find if they look.</p>
<p>So when you say social robots, what does that mean?</p>
<p>Does that include virtual ones or no?</p>
<p>I think a lot of this applies to virtual ones, too,</p>
<p>although the embodiment thing,</p>
<p>which I personally find very fascinating,</p>
<p>is definitely a factor that research shows</p>
<p>can enhance people&rsquo;s engagement with a device.</p>
<p>But can embodiment be a virtual thing also,</p>
<p>meaning like it has a body in the virtual world?</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Makes you feel like,</p>
<p>because what makes a body?</p>
<p>A body is a thing that can disappear,</p>
<p>like has a permanence.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s certain characteristics</p>
<p>that you kind of associate to a physical object.</p>
<p>So I think what I&rsquo;m referring to,</p>
<p>and I think this gets messy</p>
<p>because now we have all these new virtual worlds</p>
<p>and AR and stuff, and I think it gets messy,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s research showing that something on a screen,</p>
<p>on a traditional screen,</p>
<p>and something that is moving in your physical space,</p>
<p>that that has a very different effect</p>
<p>on how your brain perceives it even.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I have a sense</p>
<p>that we can do that in a virtual world.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>Like when I&rsquo;ve used VR, I jump around like an idiot</p>
<p>because I think something&rsquo;s gonna hit me.</p>
<p>And even if a video game on a 2D screen</p>
<p>is compelling enough,</p>
<p>like the thing that&rsquo;s immersive about it</p>
<p>is I kind of put myself into that world.</p>
<p>You kind of, those, the objects you&rsquo;re interacting with,</p>
<p>Call of Duty, things you&rsquo;re shooting,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of, I mean, your imagination fills the gaps</p>
<p>and it becomes real.</p>
<p>Like it pulls your mind in when it&rsquo;s well done.</p>
<p>So it really depends what&rsquo;s shown on the 2D screen.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think there&rsquo;s a ton of different factors</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s different types of embodiment.</p>
<p>Like you can have embodiment in a virtual world.</p>
<p>You can have an agent that&rsquo;s simply text-based,</p>
<p>which has no embodiment.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a whole spectrum</p>
<p>of factors that can influence</p>
<p>how much you engage with something.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder, I always wondered if you can have like</p>
<p>an entity living in a computer.</p>
<p>Okay, this is gonna be dark.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t always wondered about this.</p>
<p>So this is gonna make it sound like</p>
<p>I keep thinking about this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>No, but like, this is almost like black mirror,</p>
<p>but the entity that&rsquo;s convinced</p>
<p>or is able to convince you that it&rsquo;s being tortured</p>
<p>inside the computer and needs your help to get out.</p>
<p>Something like this.</p>
<p>That becomes, to me, suffering is one of the things</p>
<p>that make you empathize with.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re not good at, as you&rsquo;ve discussed in other,</p>
<p>in the physical form, like holding a robot upside down,</p>
<p>you have a really good examples about that</p>
<p>and discussing that.</p>
<p>I think suffering is a really good catalyst for empathy.</p>
<p>And I just feel like we can project embodiment</p>
<p>on a virtual thing if it&rsquo;s capable</p>
<p>of certain things like suffering.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I was wondering.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what happened with the Lambda thing.</p>
<p>Not that, none of the transcript was about suffering,</p>
<p>but it was about having the capacity</p>
<p>for suffering and human emotion</p>
<p>that convinced the engineer that this thing was sentient.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s basically the plot of Ex Machina.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>Have you ever made a robot scream in pain?</p>
<p>Have I?</p>
<p>No, but have you seen that someone,</p>
<p>oh yeah, no, they actually made a Roomba scream</p>
<p>whenever it hit a wall.</p>
<p>Yeah, I programmed that myself as well.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>I was inspired by that, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>Do you still have it?</p>
<p>Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>Hit a wall.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Whenever it bumped into something,</p>
<p>it would scream in pain.</p>
<p>No, so I had, the way I programmed the Roombas</p>
<p>is when I kick it, whenever I,</p>
<p>so contact between me and the robot is when it screams.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And you were inspired by that?</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess I misremembered the video.</p>
<p>I saw the video a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>And, or maybe I heard somebody mention it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the easiest thing to program.</p>
<p>So I did that.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t run those Roombas for over a year now,</p>
<p>but yeah, it was, my experience with it</p>
<p>was that it&rsquo;s like they quickly become,</p>
<p>like you remember them, you miss them,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re real living beings.</p>
<p>So the capacity to suffer is a really powerful thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Even then that, I mean, it was kind of hilarious.</p>
<p>It was just a random recording of screaming</p>
<p>from the internet, but it&rsquo;s still, it&rsquo;s still, it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a thing you have to get right</p>
<p>based on the interaction, like the latency.</p>
<p>Like it has, there is a,</p>
<p>there is a realistic aspect of how you should scream</p>
<p>relative to when you get hurt.</p>
<p>Like it should correspond correctly.</p>
<p>Like if you kick it really hard, it should scream louder?</p>
<p>No, it should scream at the appropriate time, not like.</p>
<p>Oh, I see.</p>
<p>One second later, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a exact, like there&rsquo;s a timing</p>
<p>when you get like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>when you run into, when you run your foot</p>
<p>into like the side of a table or something,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a timing there, the dynamics you have to get right</p>
<p>for the actual screaming.</p>
<p>Because the Roomba in particular doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>so I was, the sensors don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t know about pain.</p>
<p>See?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to say, Roomba doesn&rsquo;t understand pain.</p>
<p>So you have to correctly map the sensors,</p>
<p>the timing to the production of the sound.</p>
<p>But when you get that somewhat right,</p>
<p>it starts, it&rsquo;s a weird, it&rsquo;s a really weird feeling.</p>
<p>And you actually feel like a bad person.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, but it&rsquo;s, it makes you think</p>
<p>because that, with all the ways that we talked about,</p>
<p>that could be used to manipulate you.</p>
<p>Oh, for sure.</p>
<p>In a good and bad way.</p>
<p>So the good way is like you can form a connection</p>
<p>with a thing, and a bad way that you can form a connection</p>
<p>in order to sell you products that you don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>Yeah, or manipulate you politically,</p>
<p>or many nefarious things.</p>
<p>You tweeted, we&rsquo;re about to be living in the movie Her,</p>
<p>except instead of, see, I researched your tweets,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re like Shakespeare.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re about to be living in the movie Her,</p>
<p>except instead of about love, it&rsquo;s gonna be about,</p>
<p>what did I say, the chatbot being subtly racist,</p>
<p>and the question whether it&rsquo;s ethical</p>
<p>for companies to charge for software upgrades.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So can we break that down?</p>
<p>What do you mean by that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Obviously, some of it is humor.</p>
<p>Yes, well, kind of.</p>
<p>I am, like, ah, it&rsquo;s so weird to be in this space</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m so worried about this technology,</p>
<p>and also so excited about it at the same time.</p>
<p>But the really, like, I haven&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I had gotten a little bit jaded,</p>
<p>and then with GPT-3, and then the Lambda transcript,</p>
<p>I was like re-energized,</p>
<p>but have also been thinking a lot about,</p>
<p>you know, what are the ethical issues</p>
<p>that are gonna come up?</p>
<p>And I think some of the things that companies</p>
<p>are really gonna have to figure out is,</p>
<p>obviously, algorithmic bias is a huge</p>
<p>and known problem at this point.</p>
<p>Like, even, you know, the new image generation tools,</p>
<p>like DALI, where they&rsquo;ve clearly put in a lot of effort</p>
<p>to make sure that if you search for people,</p>
<p>it gives you a diverse set of people, et cetera.</p>
<p>Like, even that one, people have already found numerous,</p>
<p>like, ways that it just kind of regurgitates biases</p>
<p>and things that it finds on the internet.</p>
<p>Like how, if you search for success,</p>
<p>it gives you a bunch of images of men.</p>
<p>If you search for sadness,</p>
<p>it gives you a bunch of images of women.</p>
<p>So I think that this is like the really tricky one</p>
<p>with these voice agents that companies</p>
<p>are gonna have to figure out.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s subtly racist and not overtly,</p>
<p>because I think they&rsquo;re gonna be able to solve</p>
<p>the overt thing, and then with the subtle stuff,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be really difficult.</p>
<p>And then I think the other thing is gonna be,</p>
<p>yeah, like people are gonna become so emotionally attached</p>
<p>to artificial agents with this complexity of language,</p>
<p>with a potential embodiment factor that,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s already, there&rsquo;s a paper</p>
<p>at WeRobot this year written by roboticists</p>
<p>about how to deal with the fact that robots die</p>
<p>and looking at it as an ethical issue</p>
<p>because it impacts people.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s gonna be way more issues</p>
<p>than just that, like I think the tweet</p>
<p>was software upgrades, right?</p>
<p>Like how much is it okay to charge for something like that</p>
<p>if someone is deeply, emotionally invested</p>
<p>in this relationship?</p>
<p>Oh, the ethics of that, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also the practical funding mechanisms,</p>
<p>like you mentioned with AIBO, the dog.</p>
<p>In theory, there&rsquo;s a subscription.</p>
<p>Yeah, the new AIBO, so the old AIBO from the 90s,</p>
<p>people got really attached to, and in Japan,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still having like funerals and Buddhist temples</p>
<p>for the AIBOs that can&rsquo;t be repaired</p>
<p>because people really viewed them as part of their families.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about robot dogs.</p>
<p>Robot dogs, the AIBO, yeah, the original,</p>
<p>like famous robot dog that Sony made,</p>
<p>came out in the 90s, got discontinued,</p>
<p>having funerals for them in Japan.</p>
<p>Now they have a new one.</p>
<p>The new one is great, I have one at home.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s $3,000, how much is it?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s $3,000, and then after a few years,</p>
<p>you have to start paying, I think it&rsquo;s like 300 a year</p>
<p>for a subscription service for cloud services.</p>
<p>And the cloud services,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a lot,</p>
<p>the dog is more complex than the original,</p>
<p>and it has a lot of cool features,</p>
<p>and it can remember stuff and experiences,</p>
<p>and it can learn, and a lot of that</p>
<p>is outsourced to the cloud,</p>
<p>and so you have to pay to keep that running,</p>
<p>which makes sense.</p>
<p>People should pay, and people who aren&rsquo;t using it</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t have to pay,</p>
<p>but it does raise the interesting question,</p>
<p>could you set that price to reflect</p>
<p>a consumer&rsquo;s willingness to pay</p>
<p>for the emotional connection?</p>
<p>So if you know that people are really, really attached</p>
<p>to these things, just like they would be to a real dog,</p>
<p>could you just start charging more,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s more demand?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you have to be,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s true for anything that people love, right?</p>
<p>It is, and it&rsquo;s also true for real dogs,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s all these new medical services nowadays</p>
<p>where people will shell out thousands and thousands of</p>
<p>dollars to keep their pets alive,</p>
<p>and is that taking advantage of people,</p>
<p>or is that just giving them what they want?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the question.</p>
<p>Back to marriage, what about all the money</p>
<p>that it costs to get married,</p>
<p>and then all the money that it costs to get a divorce?</p>
<p>That feels like a very, that&rsquo;s like a scam.</p>
<p>I think the society is full of scams that are like.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s such a scam, and then we&rsquo;ve created,</p>
<p>the whole wedding industrial complex</p>
<p>has created all these quote-unquote traditions</p>
<p>that people buy into that aren&rsquo;t even traditions,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re just fabricated by marketing, it&rsquo;s awful.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about racist robots.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Is it up to a company that creates that to,</p>
<p>so we talk about removing bias and so on,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a really popular field in AI currently,</p>
<p>and a lot of people agree that it&rsquo;s an important field,</p>
<p>but the question is for like social robotics,</p>
<p>is should it be up to the company</p>
<p>to remove the bias of society?</p>
<p>Well, who else can?</p>
<p>Oh, to remove the bias of society.</p>
<p>I guess because there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>that are subtly racist in modern society,</p>
<p>like why shouldn&rsquo;t our robots also be subtly racist?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>why do we put so much responsibility on the robots?</p>
<p>Because, because the robots.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m imagining like a Hitler Roomba.</p>
<p>I mean, that would be funny,</p>
<p>but I guess I&rsquo;m asking a serious question.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re Jewish, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re allowed to make that joke.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly, I&rsquo;m allowed to make that joke, yes.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been nonstop reading about World War II and Hitler.</p>
<p>I think, I&rsquo;m glad we exist in a world</p>
<p>where we can just make those jokes,</p>
<p>that helps deal with it.</p>
<p>Anyway, it is a serious question of sort of like,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s such a difficult problem to solve.</p>
<p>Now, of course, like bias and so on,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s low-hanging fruit,</p>
<p>which I think was what a lot of people are focused on,</p>
<p>but then it becomes like subtle stuff over time.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very difficult to know.</p>
<p>Now, if you can also completely remove the personality,</p>
<p>you can completely remove the personalization.</p>
<p>You can remove the language aspect,</p>
<p>which is what I had been arguing,</p>
<p>because I was like,</p>
<p>the language is the disappointing aspect</p>
<p>of social robots anyway.</p>
<p>But now we&rsquo;re reintroducing that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s now no longer disappointing.</p>
<p>So I do think, well, let&rsquo;s just start with the premise,</p>
<p>which I think is very true,</p>
<p>which is that racism is not a neutral thing,</p>
<p>but it is the thing that we don&rsquo;t want in our society.</p>
<p>Like it does not conform to my values.</p>
<p>So if we agree that racism is bad,</p>
<p>I do think that it has to be the company,</p>
<p>because the problem, I mean, it might not be possible.</p>
<p>And companies might have to put out products</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re taking risks</p>
<p>and they might get slammed by consumers</p>
<p>and they might have to adjust.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how this is gonna work in the market.</p>
<p>I have opinions about how it should work,</p>
<p>but it is on the company.</p>
<p>And the danger with robots</p>
<p>is that they can entrench this stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like your racist uncle</p>
<p>who you can have a conversation with</p>
<p>and-</p>
<p>And put things into context maybe.</p>
<p>Yeah, or who might change over time with more experience.</p>
<p>A robot really just like regurgitates things,</p>
<p>entrenches them, could influence other people.</p>
<p>And I mean, I think that&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>Well, I think there&rsquo;s a difficult challenge here</p>
<p>is because even the premise you started with</p>
<p>that essentially racism is bad.</p>
<p>I think we live in a society today</p>
<p>where the definition of racism</p>
<p>is differing between different people.</p>
<p>Some people say that it&rsquo;s not enough not to be racist.</p>
<p>Some people say you have to be anti-racist.</p>
<p>So you have to have a robot that constantly calls out,</p>
<p>like calls you out on your implicit racism.</p>
<p>I would love that.</p>
<p>I would love that robot.</p>
<p>But like, maybe it sees racism.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;d love it,</p>
<p>because maybe you&rsquo;ll see racism</p>
<p>in things that aren&rsquo;t racist.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re arguing with a robot.</p>
<p>Your robot starts calling you racist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure that, I mean, it&rsquo;s a tricky thing.</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m saying that the line is not obvious,</p>
<p>especially in this heated discussion</p>
<p>where we have a lot of identity politics</p>
<p>of what is harmful to different groups and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It feels like the broader question here is,</p>
<p>should a social robotics company be solving</p>
<p>or being part of solving the issues of society?</p>
<p>Well, okay, I think it&rsquo;s the same question as,</p>
<p>should I, as an individual, be responsible</p>
<p>for knowing everything in advance</p>
<p>and saying all the right things?</p>
<p>And the answer to that is,</p>
<p>yes, I am responsible,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not gonna get it perfect.</p>
<p>And then the question is, how do we deal with that?</p>
<p>And so as a person, how I aspire to deal with that is,</p>
<p>when I do inevitably make a mistake</p>
<p>because I have blind spots and people get angry,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t take that personally.</p>
<p>And I listen to what&rsquo;s behind the anger.</p>
<p>And it can even happen that like,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;ll tweet something that&rsquo;s well-intentioned</p>
<p>and one group of people starts yelling at me</p>
<p>and then I change it the way that they said,</p>
<p>and then another group of people starts yelling at me,</p>
<p>which has happened, this happened to me actually around,</p>
<p>in my talks, I talk about robots</p>
<p>that are used in autism therapy.</p>
<p>And so whether to say a child with autism</p>
<p>or an autistic child is super controversial.</p>
<p>And a lot of autistic people prefer to be referred to</p>
<p>as autistic people.</p>
<p>And a lot of parents of autistic children</p>
<p>prefer child with autism.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s, they disagree.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve gotten yelled at from both sides.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;m still, I&rsquo;m responsible</p>
<p>even if I can&rsquo;t get it right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a responsibility thing.</p>
<p>And I can be as well-intentioned as I want</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m still gonna make mistakes.</p>
<p>And that is part of the existing power structures that exist.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that I accept.</p>
<p>And you accept being attacked from both sides</p>
<p>and grow from it and learn from it.</p>
<p>But the danger is that after being attacked,</p>
<p>assuming you don&rsquo;t get canceled,</p>
<p>AKA completely removed from your ability to tweet,</p>
<p>you might become jaded</p>
<p>and not want to talk about autism anymore.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, and I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s happened to me.</p>
<p>What I did was I listened to both sides and I chose,</p>
<p>I tried to get information.</p>
<p>And then I decided that I was going to use autistic children.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m moving forward with that.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>For now, right.</p>
<p>For now, yeah, until I get updated information</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m never gonna get anything perfect,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m making choices and I&rsquo;m moving forward</p>
<p>because being a coward and like just retreating from that,</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>But see, here&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a very smart person and an individual,</p>
<p>a researcher, a thinker, an intellectual.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the right thing for you to do.</p>
<p>The hard thing is when, as a company,</p>
<p>imagine you had a PR team.</p>
<p>I said, Kate, like this, you should.</p>
<p>We hate.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, just, well, if you were,</p>
<p>if you hired PR people, like obviously they would see that.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;d be like, well, maybe don&rsquo;t bring up autism.</p>
<p>Maybe don&rsquo;t bring up these topics.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting attacked.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad for your brand.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll say the brand word.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be, if we look at different demographics</p>
<p>that are inspired by your work,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s insensitive to them.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not mention this anymore.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s this kind of pressure</p>
<p>that all of a sudden you,</p>
<p>or you do suboptimal decisions.</p>
<p>You take a kind of poll.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s looking at the past versus the future,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And it becomes difficult.</p>
<p>In the same way that it&rsquo;s difficult</p>
<p>for social media companies to figure out</p>
<p>like who to censor, who to recommend.</p>
<p>I think this is ultimately a question about leadership,</p>
<p>honestly, like the way that I see leadership.</p>
<p>Because right now,</p>
<p>the thing that bothers me about institutions</p>
<p>and a lot of people who run current institutions</p>
<p>is that their main focus is protecting the institution</p>
<p>and protecting themselves personally.</p>
<p>That is bad leadership</p>
<p>because it means you cannot have integrity.</p>
<p>You cannot lead with integrity.</p>
<p>And it makes sense because like,</p>
<p>obviously if you&rsquo;re the type of leader</p>
<p>who immediately blows up the institution you&rsquo;re leading,</p>
<p>then that doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t have any good leaders anymore</p>
<p>because they had integrity</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t put the survival of the institution first.</p>
<p>But I feel like you have to,</p>
<p>just to be a good leader,</p>
<p>you have to be responsible</p>
<p>and understand that with great power</p>
<p>comes great responsibility.</p>
<p>You have to be humble and you have to listen</p>
<p>and you have to learn.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t get defensive</p>
<p>and you cannot put your own protection before other things.</p>
<p>Yeah, take risks where you might lose your job.</p>
<p>You might lose your wellbeing because of,</p>
<p>because in the process of standing for the principles,</p>
<p>for the things you think are right to do.</p>
<p>Yeah, based on the things you,</p>
<p>like based on learning from,</p>
<p>like listening to people</p>
<p>and learning from what they feel.</p>
<p>And the same goes for the institution, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I ultimately actually believe</p>
<p>that those kinds of companies and countries succeed</p>
<p>that have leaders like that.</p>
<p>You should run for president.</p>
<p>No, thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s maybe the problem.</p>
<p>Like the people who have good ideas about leadership,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, yeah.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>This is why I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>this is why I&rsquo;m not running a company.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been, I think, three years</p>
<p>since the Jeffrey Epstein controversy at MIT,</p>
<p>MIT Media Lab.</p>
<p>Joey Ito, the head of the Media Lab, resigned.</p>
<p>And I think at that time</p>
<p>you wrote an opinion article about it.</p>
<p>So just looking back a few years have passed,</p>
<p>what have you learned about human nature</p>
<p>from the fact that somebody like Jeffrey Epstein</p>
<p>found his way inside MIT?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really good question.</p>
<p>What have I learned about human nature?</p>
<p>I think,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s how did this problem come about?</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s what was the reaction to this problem</p>
<p>and to it becoming public?</p>
<p>And in the reaction,</p>
<p>the things I learned about human nature</p>
<p>were that sometimes cowards are worse than assholes.</p>
<p>Wow, I&rsquo;m really, ugh.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a really powerful statement.</p>
<p>I think because the assholes,</p>
<p>at least you know what you&rsquo;re dealing with.</p>
<p>They have integrity in a way.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just living out their asshole values.</p>
<p>And the cowards are the ones that you have to watch out for.</p>
<p>And this comes back to people protecting themselves</p>
<p>over doing the right thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll throw others under the bus.</p>
<p>Is there some sense</p>
<p>that not enough people took responsibility?</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>And I mean, I don&rsquo;t wanna sugarcoat at all</p>
<p>what Joey Ito did.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s gross</p>
<p>that he took money from Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>I believe him that he didn&rsquo;t know about the bad, bad stuff,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been in those circles</p>
<p>with those like public intellectual dudes</p>
<p>that he was hanging out with.</p>
<p>And any woman in those circles,</p>
<p>any woman in those circles saw 10 zillion red flags.</p>
<p>Just the whole environment was so misogynist.</p>
<p>And so personally, because Joey was a great boss</p>
<p>and a great friend,</p>
<p>I was really disappointed that he ignored that</p>
<p>in favor of raising money.</p>
<p>And I think that it was right for him to resign</p>
<p>in the face of that.</p>
<p>But one of the things that he did</p>
<p>that many others didn&rsquo;t was he came forward about it</p>
<p>and he took responsibility.</p>
<p>And all of the people who didn&rsquo;t, I think,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just interesting.</p>
<p>The other thing I learned about human nature,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m gonna go on a tangent,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll come back, I promise.</p>
<p>So I once saw this tweet from someone</p>
<p>or it was a Twitter thread</p>
<p>from someone who worked at a homeless shelter.</p>
<p>And he said that when he started working there,</p>
<p>he noticed that people would often come in</p>
<p>and use the bathroom</p>
<p>and they would just trash the entire bathroom,</p>
<p>like rip things out of the walls,</p>
<p>like toilet paper on the ground.</p>
<p>And he asked someone who had been there longer,</p>
<p>like, why do they do this?</p>
<p>Why do the homeless people come in and trash the bathroom?</p>
<p>And he was told it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s the only thing</p>
<p>in their lives that they have control over.</p>
<p>And I feel like sometimes when it comes to the response,</p>
<p>just the mobbing response that happens</p>
<p>in the wake of some harm that was caused,</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t target the person</p>
<p>who actually caused the harm who was Epstein,</p>
<p>you will go as many circles out as you can</p>
<p>until you find the person that you have power over</p>
<p>and you have control over, and then you will trash that.</p>
<p>And it makes sense that people do this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s again, it&rsquo;s a human nature thing.</p>
<p>Of course, you&rsquo;re gonna focus all your energy</p>
<p>because you feel helpless and enraged</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s unfair and you have no other power.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna focus all of your energy</p>
<p>on someone who&rsquo;s so far removed from the problem</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s not even an efficient solution.</p>
<p>The problem is often the first person you find</p>
<p>is the one that has integrity,</p>
<p>sufficient integrity to take responsibility.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s why my husband always says,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a liberal, but he&rsquo;s always like,</p>
<p>when liberals form a firing squad, they stand in a circle.</p>
<p>Because you know that your friends</p>
<p>are gonna listen to you, so you criticize them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna be able</p>
<p>to convince someone across the aisle.</p>
<p>But see, in that situation, what I had hoped</p>
<p>is the people in the farther, in that situation,</p>
<p>any situation of that sort,</p>
<p>the people that are farther out in the circles,</p>
<p>stand up and also take some responsibility</p>
<p>for the broader picture of human nature</p>
<p>versus specific situation,</p>
<p>but also take some responsibility</p>
<p>and, but also defend the people involved</p>
<p>as flawed, not in a like, no, no, no, nothing,</p>
<p>like this, people fucked up.</p>
<p>Like you said, there&rsquo;s a lot of red flags</p>
<p>that people just ignored for the sake of money</p>
<p>in this particular case.</p>
<p>But also like be transparent and public about it</p>
<p>and spread the responsibility</p>
<p>across a large number of people</p>
<p>such that you learn a lesson from it institutionally.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was a systems problem.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a one individual problem.</p>
<p>And I feel like currently,</p>
<p>because Joey took, resigned because of it,</p>
<p>or essentially fired, pressured out because of it,</p>
<p>MIT can pretend like, oh, we didn&rsquo;t know anything.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t part-</p>
<p>Bad leadership, again,</p>
<p>because when you are at the top of an institution</p>
<p>with that much power and you were complicit</p>
<p>in what happened, which they were,</p>
<p>like, come on, there&rsquo;s no way that they didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that this was happening.</p>
<p>So like to not stand up and take responsibility,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s bad leadership.</p>
<p>Do you understand why Epstein was able to</p>
<p>outside of MIT, he was able to make a lot of friends</p>
<p>with a lot of powerful people.</p>
<p>Does that make sense to you?</p>
<p>Why was he able to get in these rooms,</p>
<p>befriend these people,</p>
<p>befriend people that I don&rsquo;t know personally,</p>
<p>but I think a lot of them indirectly I know</p>
<p>as being good people, smart people.</p>
<p>Why would they let Jeffrey Epstein into their office,</p>
<p>have a discussion with them?</p>
<p>What do you understand about human nature from that?</p>
<p>Well, so I never met Epstein or,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve met some of the people who interacted with him,</p>
<p>but I was never, like, I never saw him in action.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how charismatic he was or what that was,</p>
<p>but I do think that sometimes the simple answer</p>
<p>is the more likely one.</p>
<p>And from my understanding, what he would do is,</p>
<p>he was kind of a social grifter,</p>
<p>like, you know those people who will,</p>
<p>you must get this because you&rsquo;re famous.</p>
<p>You must get people coming to you and being like,</p>
<p>oh, I know your friend so-and-so</p>
<p>in order to get cred with you.</p>
<p>I think he just convinced some people</p>
<p>who were trusted in a network</p>
<p>that he was a great guy and that, you know, whatever.</p>
<p>I think at that point,</p>
<p>because at that point he had had like a,</p>
<p>what, a conviction prior, but it was a one-off thing.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t clear that there was this other thing</p>
<p>that was that.</p>
<p>And most people probably don&rsquo;t check.</p>
<p>Yeah, and most people don&rsquo;t check.</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re at an event, you meet this guy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe people do check</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re that powerful and wealthy,</p>
<p>or maybe they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re just stupid.</p>
<p>I mean, and they&rsquo;re not, like,</p>
<p>all right, does anyone check anything about me?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve walked into some of the richest,</p>
<p>some of the most powerful people in the world,</p>
<p>and nobody, like, asks questions,</p>
<p>like, who the fuck is this guy?</p>
<p>Like-</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, nobody asks those questions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I would think, like,</p>
<p>there would be more security or something.</p>
<p>Like, there really isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think a lot of it has to do,</p>
<p>well, my hope is, in my case,</p>
<p>has to do with, like,</p>
<p>people can sense that this is a good person,</p>
<p>but if that&rsquo;s the case, then they can surely,</p>
<p>then a human being can use charisma to infiltrate.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just being, just saying the right thing.</p>
<p>And once you have people vouching for you</p>
<p>within that type of network,</p>
<p>like, once you, yeah,</p>
<p>once you have someone powerful vouching for you</p>
<p>who someone else trusts,</p>
<p>then, you know, you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>So how do you avoid something like that?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re MIT, if you&rsquo;re Harvard,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re any of these institutions?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, first of all,</p>
<p>you have to do your homework</p>
<p>before you take money from someone.</p>
<p>Like, I think that&rsquo;s required.</p>
<p>But I think, you know, I think Joey did do his homework.</p>
<p>I think he did.</p>
<p>And I think at the time that he took money,</p>
<p>there was the one conviction and not, like, the later thing.</p>
<p>And I think that the story at that time was that</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t know she was underage and blah, blah, blah,</p>
<p>or whatever, it was a mistake.</p>
<p>And Joey always believed in redemption for people,</p>
<p>and that people can change,</p>
<p>and that they can genuinely regret,</p>
<p>and, like, learn and move on.</p>
<p>And he was a big believer in that.</p>
<p>So I could totally see him being like,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m not gonna exclude him because of this thing,</p>
<p>and because other people are vouching for him.</p>
<p>Just to be clear,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re now talking about the set of people</p>
<p>who I think Joey belonged to</p>
<p>who did not, like, go to the island</p>
<p>and have sex with underage girls,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a whole other set of people</p>
<p>who, like, were powerful,</p>
<p>and, like, were part of that network,</p>
<p>and who knew and participated.</p>
<p>And so, like, I distinguish between</p>
<p>people who got taken in,</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t know that that was happening,</p>
<p>and people who knew.</p>
<p>I wonder what the different circles look like.</p>
<p>So, like, people that went to the island</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t do anything, didn&rsquo;t see anything,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know about anything,</p>
<p>versus the people that did something.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s people who heard rumors, maybe.</p>
<p>And what do you do with rumors?</p>
<p>Like, isn&rsquo;t there people that heard rumors</p>
<p>about Bill Cosby for the longest time?</p>
<p>For, like, for the longest,</p>
<p>like, whenever that happened,</p>
<p>like, all these people came out of the woodwork,</p>
<p>like, everybody kind of knew.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, all right,</p>
<p>so what are you supposed to do with rumors?</p>
<p>Like, what?</p>
<p>I think the other way to put it is red flags,</p>
<p>as you were saying.</p>
<p>Yeah, and, like, I can tell you that those circles,</p>
<p>like, there were red flags</p>
<p>without me even hearing any rumors about anything ever.</p>
<p>Like, I was already, like,</p>
<p>there are not a lot of women here, which is a bad sign.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there a lot of places where there&rsquo;s not a lot of women,</p>
<p>and that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean it&rsquo;s a bad sign?</p>
<p>There are, if it&rsquo;s, like, a pipeline problem</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s, like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>technology law clinic that only gets, like, male lawyers,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s not a lot of women,</p>
<p>you know, applicants in the pool.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s some aspect of this situation</p>
<p>that, like, there should be more women here.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve,</p>
<p>actually, I&rsquo;d love to ask you about this,</p>
<p>because you have strong opinions about Richard Stallman.</p>
<p>Is that, do you still have those strong opinions?</p>
<p>Look, all I need to say is that he met my friend,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a law professor.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She shook his hand, and he licked her arm</p>
<p>from wrist to elbow,</p>
<p>and it certainly wasn&rsquo;t appropriate at that time.</p>
<p>What about if you&rsquo;re, like, an incredibly weird person?</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s a good question,</p>
<p>because, obviously, there&rsquo;s a lot of neurodivergence</p>
<p>at MIT and everywhere, and, obviously,</p>
<p>like, we need to accept that people are different,</p>
<p>that people don&rsquo;t understand social conventions</p>
<p>the same way.</p>
<p>But one of the things that I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>about neurodivergence is that women are often</p>
<p>expected or taught to mask their neurodivergence</p>
<p>and kind of fit in,</p>
<p>and men are accommodated and excused.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that being neurodivergent</p>
<p>gives you a license to be an asshole.</p>
<p>You can be a weird person, and you can still learn</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not okay to lick someone&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a balance.</p>
<p>Like, women should be allowed to be a little weirder,</p>
<p>and men should be less weird.</p>
<p>Because I think there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re one of the people, I think,</p>
<p>tweeting that, what made me,</p>
<p>because I wanted to talk to Richard Stallman</p>
<p>on the podcast about,</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t have a context,</p>
<p>because I wanted to talk to him,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s, you know, free software.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very weird in interesting, good ways</p>
<p>in the world of computer science.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also weird in that, you know, when he gives a talk,</p>
<p>he would be like picking at his feet</p>
<p>and eating the skin off his feet, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s known for these extremely kind of,</p>
<p>how else do you put it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to put it.</p>
<p>But then there was something that happened to him</p>
<p>in conversations on this thread related to Epstein.</p>
<p>Which I was torn about,</p>
<p>because I felt it&rsquo;s similar to Joy Ito&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Like, I felt he was maligned.</p>
<p>Like, people were looking for somebody to get angry at.</p>
<p>So he was inappropriate, but the,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t like the cowardice more.</p>
<p>Like, I set aside his situation, and we could discuss it.</p>
<p>But the cowardice on MIT&rsquo;s part, and this is me saying it,</p>
<p>about the way they treated that whole situation.</p>
<p>Oh, they&rsquo;re always cowards about how they treat anything.</p>
<p>They just try to make the problem go away.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it was about, yeah, exactly,</p>
<p>making the conversation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I think he should have left the mailing list.</p>
<p>He shouldn&rsquo;t have been part of the mailing list.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s probably true also.</p>
<p>But I think what bothered me,</p>
<p>what always botherss me in these mailing list situations,</p>
<p>or Twitter situations, like,</p>
<p>if you say something that&rsquo;s hurtful to people,</p>
<p>or makes people angry,</p>
<p>and then people start yelling at you.</p>
<p>Maybe they shouldn&rsquo;t be yelling.</p>
<p>Maybe they are yelling because, again,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the only point of power they have.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s okay that you&rsquo;re yelling.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s your response to that that matters.</p>
<p>And I think that I just have a lot of respect for people</p>
<p>who can say, oh, people are angry.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason they&rsquo;re angry.</p>
<p>Let me find out what that reason is</p>
<p>and learn more about it.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;m bad.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;m ill-intentioned.</p>
<p>But why are they angry?</p>
<p>I wanna understand.</p>
<p>And then, once you understand,</p>
<p>you can respond, again, with integrity,</p>
<p>and say, actually, I stand by what I said.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>Or you can say, actually, I listened,</p>
<p>and here are some things I learned.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of response I wanna see from people.</p>
<p>And people like Stallman do not respond that way.</p>
<p>They just, like, go into battle.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like, where it&rsquo;s obvious you didn&rsquo;t listen.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No interest in listening.</p>
<p>Honestly, that&rsquo;s, to me,</p>
<p>as bad as the people who just apologize</p>
<p>just because they are trying to make the problem go away.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, like, if you-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, like, both are bad.</p>
<p>A good apology has to include</p>
<p>understanding what you did wrong.</p>
<p>And, in part, standing up for the things</p>
<p>you think you did right.</p>
<p>So, like-</p>
<p>Yeah, if there are those things, yeah.</p>
<p>Finding, and then, but you have to give,</p>
<p>you have to acknowledge,</p>
<p>you have to, like, give that hard hit to the ego</p>
<p>that says I did something wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely Richard Stallman is not somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s capable of that kind of thing,</p>
<p>or hasn&rsquo;t given evidence of that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But that was also, even just your tweet,</p>
<p>I had to do a lot of thinking, like,</p>
<p>different people from different walks of life</p>
<p>see red flags in different things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so, things I find</p>
<p>as a man, non-threatening and hilarious,</p>
<p>are not necessarily,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t, like, deeply hurtful to others.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean that in a social justice warrior way,</p>
<p>but in a real way,</p>
<p>like, people really have different experiences.</p>
<p>So, I have to, like, really put things into context.</p>
<p>I have to kind of listen to what people are saying,</p>
<p>put aside the emotion of what they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>emotion with which they&rsquo;re saying it,</p>
<p>and try to keep the facts of their experience,</p>
<p>and learn from it.</p>
<p>And because it&rsquo;s not just about</p>
<p>the individual experience, either.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like, oh, you know,</p>
<p>my friend didn&rsquo;t have a sense of humor about being licked.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that she&rsquo;s been metaphorically licked,</p>
<p>you know, 57 times that week,</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s an attractive law professor,</p>
<p>and she doesn&rsquo;t get taken seriously.</p>
<p>And so, like, men walk through the world,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s impossible for them to even understand</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s like to have a different experience of the world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important to listen to people,</p>
<p>and believe people,</p>
<p>and believe that they&rsquo;re angry for a reason.</p>
<p>Maybe you don&rsquo;t like their tone.</p>
<p>Maybe you don&rsquo;t like that they&rsquo;re angry at you.</p>
<p>Maybe you get defensive about that.</p>
<p>Maybe you think that they should, you know,</p>
<p>explain it to you.</p>
<p>But believe that they&rsquo;re angry for a reason,</p>
<p>and try to understand it.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a deep truth there,</p>
<p>and an opportunity for you to become a better person.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t you been doing that for two hours?</p>
<p>Three hours now.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s been saying that she&rsquo;s an innocent victim.</p>
<p>Is she an innocent victim,</p>
<p>or is she evil and equally responsible,</p>
<p>like Jeffrey Epstein?</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m asking far away from any MIT things,</p>
<p>and more just your sense of the whole situation.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been following it,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know the facts of the situation,</p>
<p>and what is now known to be her role in that.</p>
<p>If I were her, clearly I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>But if I were her, I wouldn&rsquo;t be going around</p>
<p>saying I&rsquo;m an innocent victim.</p>
<p>I would say,</p>
<p>maybe she&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s saying.</p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>She was controlled by Jeffrey.</p>
<p>Is she saying this as part of a legal case,</p>
<p>or is she saying this as a PR thing?</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>PR.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just her.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s her whole family believes this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole effort that says like,</p>
<p>how should I put it?</p>
<p>I believe they believe it.</p>
<p>So in that sense, it&rsquo;s not PR.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I believe the family,</p>
<p>basically the family is saying that</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a really good human being.</p>
<p>Well, I think everyone is a good human being.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s a controversial opinion,</p>
<p>but I think everyone</p>
<p>is a good human being.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no evil people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people who do bad things</p>
<p>and who behave in ways that harm others.</p>
<p>And I think we should always hold people</p>
<p>accountable for that.</p>
<p>But holding someone accountable doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>saying that they&rsquo;re evil.</p>
<p>Yeah, actually those people usually think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing good.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, aside from,</p>
<p>maybe sociopaths are specifically trying to harm people.</p>
<p>But I think most people are trying to do their best.</p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;re not doing their best,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s some impediment</p>
<p>or something in their past.</p>
<p>So I genuinely don&rsquo;t believe in good and evil people,</p>
<p>but I do believe in harmful and not harmful actions.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Yeah, she&rsquo;s a good person.</p>
<p>But if she contributed to harm,</p>
<p>then she needs to be accountable for that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my position.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the facts of the matter are.</p>
<p>It seems like she was pretty close to the situation,</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t seem very believable that she was a victim,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I wish I have met Epstein,</p>
<p>because something tells me he would just be</p>
<p>a regular person, a charismatic person,</p>
<p>like anybody else.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very dark reality</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t know which among us,</p>
<p>what each of us are hiding in the closet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really tough thing to deal with,</p>
<p>because then you can put your trust into some people</p>
<p>and they can completely betray that trust</p>
<p>and in the process destroy you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>that interacted with Epstein that now have to,</p>
<p>I mean, if they&rsquo;re not destroyed by it,</p>
<p>then their whole,</p>
<p>the ground on which they stand ethically</p>
<p>has crumbled, at least in part.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure you and I have interacted with people</p>
<p>without knowing it who are bad people.</p>
<p>As I always tell my four-year-old,</p>
<p>people who have done bad things.</p>
<p>People who have done bad things.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s always talking about bad guys</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to move him towards,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just people who make bad choices.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really powerful, actually.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really important to remember,</p>
<p>because that means you have compassion</p>
<p>towards all human beings.</p>
<p>Do you have hope for the future of MIT,</p>
<p>a future of Media Lab in this context?</p>
<p>So David Newman is now at the helm.</p>
<p>I talked to her previously, I&rsquo;ll talk to her again.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I love her.</p>
<p>Yeah, she&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if she knew the whole situation</p>
<p>when she started, because the situation went beyond</p>
<p>just the Epstein scandal.</p>
<p>A bunch of other stuff happened at the same time.</p>
<p>Some of it&rsquo;s not public,</p>
<p>but what I was personally going through at that time.</p>
<p>So the Epstein thing happened, I think,</p>
<p>was it August or September 2019?</p>
<p>It was somewhere around late summer in June 2019.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a research scientist at MIT.</p>
<p>You are too, right?</p>
<p>So, and I always have had various supervisors</p>
<p>over the years, and they&rsquo;ve just basically</p>
<p>let me do what I want, which has been great.</p>
<p>But I had a supervisor at the time,</p>
<p>and he called me into his office for a regular check-in.</p>
<p>In June of 2019, I reported to MIT</p>
<p>that my supervisor had grabbed me,</p>
<p>pulled me into a hug, wrapped his arms around my waist,</p>
<p>and started massaging my hip and trying to kiss me,</p>
<p>kissed my face, kissed me near the mouth,</p>
<p>and said literally the words,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll take care of your career.</p>
<p>And that experience was really interesting</p>
<p>because I just, I was very indignant.</p>
<p>I was like, he can&rsquo;t do that to me.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t he know who I am?</p>
<p>And I was like, this is the Me Too era.</p>
<p>And I naively thought that when I reported that,</p>
<p>it would get taken care of.</p>
<p>And then I had to go through the whole reporting process</p>
<p>at MIT, and I learned a lot about how institutions</p>
<p>really handle those things internally,</p>
<p>particularly situations where I couldn&rsquo;t provide evidence</p>
<p>that it happened.</p>
<p>I had no reason to lie about it, but I had no evidence.</p>
<p>And so I was going through that,</p>
<p>and that was another experience for me</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s so many people in the institution</p>
<p>who really believe in protecting the institution</p>
<p>at all costs.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s only a few people who care</p>
<p>about doing the right thing.</p>
<p>And one of them resigned.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s even less of them left, so.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;d you learn from that?</p>
<p>I mean, where&rsquo;s the source, if you have hope</p>
<p>for this institution that I think you love,</p>
<p>at least in part.</p>
<p>I love the idea of MIT.</p>
<p>I love the idea, I love the research body,</p>
<p>I love a lot of the faculty, I love the students.</p>
<p>I love the energy, like I love it all.</p>
<p>I think the administration suffers from the same problems</p>
<p>as any institutional, any leadership of an institution</p>
<p>that is large, which is that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve become risk-averse, like you mentioned.</p>
<p>They care about PR.</p>
<p>The only ways to get their attention</p>
<p>or change their minds about anything</p>
<p>are to threaten the reputation of the institute</p>
<p>or to have a lot of money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only way to have power at the institute.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think they have a lot of integrity</p>
<p>or believe in ideas or even have a lot of connection</p>
<p>to the research body and the people who are really,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so weird.</p>
<p>You have this amazing research body of people</p>
<p>pushing the boundaries of things</p>
<p>who aren&rsquo;t afraid to, there&rsquo;s the hacker culture,</p>
<p>and then you have the administration</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re really like,</p>
<p>protect the institution at all costs.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a disconnect, right?</p>
<p>Complete disconnect.</p>
<p>I wonder if that was always there,</p>
<p>if it just kind of slowly grows over time,</p>
<p>a disconnect between the administration and the faculty.</p>
<p>I think it grew over time is what I&rsquo;ve heard.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve been there for 11 years now.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s gotten worse during my time,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve heard from people who&rsquo;ve been there longer</p>
<p>that it didn&rsquo;t, like MIT didn&rsquo;t used to have</p>
<p>a general counsel&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t used to have all of this corporate stuff.</p>
<p>And then they had to create it as they got bigger</p>
<p>and in the era where such things are,</p>
<p>I guess, deemed necessary.</p>
<p>See, I believe in the power of individuals</p>
<p>to overthrow the thing.</p>
<p>So just a really good president of MIT</p>
<p>or certain people in the administration</p>
<p>can reform the whole thing.</p>
<p>Because the culture is still there of like,</p>
<p>I think everybody remembers that MIT</p>
<p>is about the students and the faculty.</p>
<p>Do they though?</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ve had a lot of conversations</p>
<p>that have been shocking with like senior administration.</p>
<p>They think the students are children.</p>
<p>They call them kids.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, these are the smartest people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re way smarter than you.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re so dismissive of that.</p>
<p>But those individuals, I&rsquo;m saying like the capacity,</p>
<p>like the aura of the place still values the students</p>
<p>and the faculty.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m being awfully poetic about it,</p>
<p>but what I mean is the administration</p>
<p>is the froth at the top of the, like the waves, the surface.</p>
<p>Like they can be removed</p>
<p>and new life can be brought in</p>
<p>that would keep to the spirit of the place.</p>
<p>Who decides on who to bring in?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s hiring?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bottom up.</p>
<p>Oh, I see.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>But I do think ultimately,</p>
<p>especially in the era of social media and so on,</p>
<p>faculty and students have more and more power.</p>
<p>Just more and more of a voice, I suppose.</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>I really do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see MIT going away anytime soon.</p>
<p>And I also don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a terrible place at all.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s an amazing place.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s different trajectories it can take.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And like, and that has to do with a lot of things,</p>
<p>including, does it, is it stays,</p>
<p>even if we talk about robotics,</p>
<p>it could be the capital of the world in robotics.</p>
<p>But currently, if you wanna be doing the best AI work</p>
<p>in the world, you&rsquo;re gonna go to Google</p>
<p>or Facebook or Tesla or Apple or so on.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna be at MIT.</p>
<p>And so that has to do,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s basically has to do</p>
<p>with not allowing the brilliance</p>
<p>of the researchers to flourish.</p>
<p>Yeah, people say it&rsquo;s about money,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s about that at all.</p>
<p>Like, sometimes you have more freedom</p>
<p>and can work on more interesting things in companies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really where they lose people.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the freedom in all ways,</p>
<p>which is why it&rsquo;s heartbreaking to get people</p>
<p>like Richard Stallman, there&rsquo;s such an interesting line,</p>
<p>because Richard Stallman&rsquo;s a gigantic weirdo</p>
<p>that crossed lines he shouldn&rsquo;t have crossed, right?</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t wanna draw too many lines.</p>
<p>This is the tricky thing.</p>
<p>There are different types of lines, in my opinion.</p>
<p>But yes, your opinion, you have strong lines you hold to,</p>
<p>but then if administration listens to every line,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also power in drawing a line.</p>
<p>Like, and it becomes like a little drug.</p>
<p>You have to find the right balance.</p>
<p>Licking somebody&rsquo;s arm is never appropriate.</p>
<p>I think the biggest aspect there is not owning it,</p>
<p>learning from it, growing from it</p>
<p>from the perspective of Stallman or people like that,</p>
<p>back when it happened, like understanding,</p>
<p>seeing the right, being empathetic,</p>
<p>seeing the fact that this was totally inappropriate.</p>
<p>Not when that particular act,</p>
<p>but everything that led up to it, too.</p>
<p>No, I think there are different kinds of lines.</p>
<p>I think there are&hellip;</p>
<p>So Stallman crossed lines that essentially excluded</p>
<p>a bunch of people and created an environment</p>
<p>where there are brilliant minds</p>
<p>that we never got the benefit of</p>
<p>because he made things feel gross</p>
<p>or even unsafe for people.</p>
<p>There are lines that you can cross</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re challenging an institution to&hellip;</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t think he was intentionally</p>
<p>trying to cross a line, or maybe he didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>There are lines that you can cross intentionally</p>
<p>to move something forward or to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Like when MIT was like,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t put an all-gender restroom in the media lab</p>
<p>because something permits whatever,</p>
<p>and Joey did it anyway.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a line you can cross</p>
<p>to make things actually better for people.</p>
<p>And the line you&rsquo;re crossing is some arbitrary, stupid rule</p>
<p>that people who don&rsquo;t wanna take the risk are like&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>No, ultimately, I think the thing you said</p>
<p>is cross lines in a way that doesn&rsquo;t alienate others.</p>
<p>So for example, I started for a while</p>
<p>wearing a suit often at MIT,</p>
<p>which sounds counterintuitive,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s actually&hellip;</p>
<p>People always looked at me weird for that.</p>
<p>MIT created this culture,</p>
<p>specifically the people I was working with.</p>
<p>Nobody wore suits.</p>
<p>Maybe the business school does.</p>
<p>Yeah, we don&rsquo;t trust the suits.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t trust the suits.</p>
<p>I was like, fuck you, I&rsquo;m wearing a suit.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not really hurting anybody, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s challenging people&rsquo;s perceptions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s doing something that you wanna do,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not hurting people.</p>
<p>And that particular thing was, yeah, it was hurting people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good line.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good line.</p>
<p>Hurting ultimately the people that you want to flourish.</p>
<p>You tweeted a picture of pumpkin spice Greek yogurt</p>
<p>and asked, grounds for divorce?</p>
<p>Yes, no.</p>
<p>So let me ask you,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the key to a successful relationship?</p>
<p>Oh my God, a good couple therapist?</p>
<p>What went wrong with the pumpkin spice Greek yogurt?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s exactly wrong?</p>
<p>Is it the pumpkin?</p>
<p>Is it the Greek yogurt?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>I stared at that tweet for a while.</p>
<p>I grew up in Europe,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t understand the pumpkin spice in everything craze</p>
<p>that they do every autumn here.</p>
<p>I understand that it might be good in some foods,</p>
<p>but they just put it in everything.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t belong in Greek yogurt.</p>
<p>I mean, I was just being humorous.</p>
<p>I ate one of those yogurts</p>
<p>and it actually tasted pretty good.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I think part of the success of a good marriage</p>
<p>is giving each other a hard time humorously</p>
<p>for things like that.</p>
<p>Is there a broader lesson?</p>
<p>Because you guys seem to have a really great marriage</p>
<p>from the external.</p>
<p>I mean, every marriage looks good from the external.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true, but yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>No, but like relationships are hard.</p>
<p>Relationships with anyone are hard.</p>
<p>And especially because people evolve and change</p>
<p>and you have to make sure there&rsquo;s space</p>
<p>for both people to evolve and change together.</p>
<p>And I think one of the things</p>
<p>that I really liked about our marriage vows was,</p>
<p>I remember before we got married,</p>
<p>Greg, at some point, got kind of nervous</p>
<p>and he was like, it&rsquo;s such a big commitment</p>
<p>to commit to something for life.</p>
<p>And I was like, we&rsquo;re not committing to this for life.</p>
<p>And he was like, we&rsquo;re not?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, no, we&rsquo;re committing to being part of a team</p>
<p>and doing what&rsquo;s best for the team.</p>
<p>If what&rsquo;s best for the team is to break up, we&rsquo;ll break up.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t believe in this.</p>
<p>Like, we have to do this for our whole lives.</p>
<p>And that really resonated with him too.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>Did you put in the vows?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that was our vows.</p>
<p>Like that we&rsquo;re just, we&rsquo;re gonna be a team.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a team and do what&rsquo;s right for the team.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very like Michael Jordan view.</p>
<p>Did you guys get like married in the desert</p>
<p>like November rain style with Slash playing?</p>
<p>Or, you don&rsquo;t have to answer that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not good at these questions.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve brought up marriage like eight times.</p>
<p>Are you trying to hint something on the podcast?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, yeah, I have an announcement to make.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It just seems like a good metaphor for,</p>
<p>why would, it felt like a good metaphor for,</p>
<p>in a bunch of cases, for the marriage industrial complex.</p>
<p>I remember that.</p>
<p>And, oh, people complaining.</p>
<p>It just seemed like marriage is one of the things</p>
<p>that always surprises me.</p>
<p>Because I want to get married.</p>
<p>You do?</p>
<p>Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>And then I listened to like friends of mine that complain.</p>
<p>Not all, I like guys, I really like guys</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t complain about their marriage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a cheap, like if,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a cheap release valve,</p>
<p>like that doesn&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s bitching about anything,</p>
<p>honestly, that&rsquo;s just like, it&rsquo;s too easy.</p>
<p>But especially, like, bitch about the sports team</p>
<p>or the weather if you want.</p>
<p>But like, about somebody that you&rsquo;re dedicating</p>
<p>your life to, like, if you bitch about them,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to see them as a lesser being also.</p>
<p>Like, you don&rsquo;t think so,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re going to like decrease the value you have.</p>
<p>I personally believe, over time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to appreciate the magic of that person.</p>
<p>I think, anyway.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like, I just notice this a lot,</p>
<p>that people are married and they will whine about,</p>
<p>you know, like the wife, whatever.</p>
<p>This, it&rsquo;s part of the sort of the culture</p>
<p>to kind of comment in that way.</p>
<p>I think women do the same thing about the husband.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t, he never does this, or he&rsquo;s a goof.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s incompetent at this or that, whatever.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of-</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s those tropes like,</p>
<p>oh, you know, husbands never do X.</p>
<p>And like, wives are, I think those do a disservice</p>
<p>to everyone, it&rsquo;s just disrespectful to everyone involved.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it happens.</p>
<p>So I was, I brought that up as an example</p>
<p>of something that people actually love,</p>
<p>but they complain about, because for some reason</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more fun to do, is complain about stuff.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what with Clippy or whatever, right?</p>
<p>So like, you complain about, but you actually love it.</p>
<p>There you go, it&rsquo;s just a good metaphor that, you know.</p>
<p>What was I gonna ask you?</p>
<p>Oh, you,</p>
<p>your hamster died.</p>
<p>When I was like eight.</p>
<p>Eight, you miss her?</p>
<p>Beige.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the closest relationship you&rsquo;ve had with a pet?</p>
<p>Not the one?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Pet or robot have you loved the most in your life?</p>
<p>I think my first pet was a goldfish named Bob,</p>
<p>and he died immediately, and that was really sad.</p>
<p>I think it was really attached to Bob and Nancy,</p>
<p>my goldfish.</p>
<p>We got new Bobs, and then Bob kept dying,</p>
<p>and we got new Bobs, Nancy just kept living.</p>
<p>So it was very replaceable.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was young.</p>
<p>It was easy to.</p>
<p>Do you think there will be a time when the robot,</p>
<p>like in the movie Her,</p>
<p>be something we fall in love with romantically?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, oh for sure, yeah.</p>
<p>At scale, like we&rsquo;re a lot of people.</p>
<p>Romantically, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s gonna happen at scale.</p>
<p>I think we talked about this a little bit last time</p>
<p>on the podcast too, where I think we&rsquo;re just capable</p>
<p>of so many different kinds of relationships.</p>
<p>And actually, part of why I think marriage is so tough</p>
<p>as a relationship is because we put so many expectations</p>
<p>on it, like your partner has to be your best friend,</p>
<p>and you have to be sexually attracted to them,</p>
<p>and they have to be a good co-parent and a good roommate,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all the relationships at once that have to work.</p>
<p>But normally with other people,</p>
<p>we have one type of relationship,</p>
<p>or we even have a different relationship to our dog</p>
<p>than we do to our neighbor,</p>
<p>than we do to the person, someone, a co-worker.</p>
<p>I think that some people are gonna find</p>
<p>romantic relationships with robots interesting.</p>
<p>It might even be a widespread thing,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gonna replace</p>
<p>human romantic relationships.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just gonna be a separate type of thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be more narrow.</p>
<p>More narrow, or even just something new</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t really experienced before.</p>
<p>Maybe having a crush on an artificial agent</p>
<p>is a different type of fascination.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Do you think people would see that as cheating?</p>
<p>I think people would, well, I mean,</p>
<p>the things that people feel threatened by in relationships</p>
<p>are very manifold, so.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s just an interesting one,</p>
<p>because maybe they&rsquo;ll be good,</p>
<p>a little jealousy for the relationship.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;ll be part of the couple&rsquo;s therapy,</p>
<p>that kind of thing, or whatever.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think jealousy, I mean, I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to avoid jealousy,</p>
<p>but I think the objective is probably to avoid it.</p>
<p>I mean, some people don&rsquo;t even get jealous</p>
<p>when their partner sleeps with someone else.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s polyamory, and.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s just such a diversity of different ways</p>
<p>that we can structure relationships, or view them,</p>
<p>that this is just gonna be another one that we add.</p>
<p>You dedicate your book to your dad.</p>
<p>What did you learn about life from your dad?</p>
<p>Oh, man, my dad is,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a great listener, and he is</p>
<p>the best person I know</p>
<p>at the type of cognitive empathy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s perspective-taking.</p>
<p>So, not emotional, crying empathy,</p>
<p>but trying to see someone else&rsquo;s point of view,</p>
<p>and trying to put yourself in their shoes.</p>
<p>And he really instilled that in me from an early age.</p>
<p>And then he made me read a ton of science fiction,</p>
<p>which probably led me down this path.</p>
<p>Taught you how to be curious about the world,</p>
<p>and how to be open-minded.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Last question.</p>
<p>What role does love play in the human condition?</p>
<p>Since we&rsquo;ve been talking about love and robots,</p>
<p>how, and you&rsquo;re fascinated by social robotics.</p>
<p>It feels like all of that operates in the landscape</p>
<p>of something that we can call love.</p>
<p>Love?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think there are a lot of different kinds of love.</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s, we need,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, don&rsquo;t the Eskimos have</p>
<p>all these different words for snow?</p>
<p>We need more words to describe different types</p>
<p>and kinds of love that we experience.</p>
<p>But I think love is so important,</p>
<p>and I also think it&rsquo;s not zero-sum.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the really interesting thing about love,</p>
<p>is that I had one kid, and I loved my first kid</p>
<p>more than anything else in the world.</p>
<p>And I was like, how can I have a second kid,</p>
<p>and then love that kid also?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never gonna love it as much as the first.</p>
<p>But I love them both equally.</p>
<p>It just, my heart expanded.</p>
<p>And so I think that people who are threatened</p>
<p>by love towards artificial agents,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t need to be threatened for that reason.</p>
<p>Artificial agents will just, if done right,</p>
<p>will just expand your capacity for love.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Beautifully put.</p>
<p>Kate, this was awesome.</p>
<p>I still didn&rsquo;t talk about half the things</p>
<p>I wanted to talk about, but we&rsquo;re already</p>
<p>way over three hours, so thank you so much.</p>
<p>I really appreciate you talking today.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re awesome.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an amazing human being,</p>
<p>and a great roboticist, great writer now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an honor that you would talk with me.</p>
<p>Thanks for doing it.</p>
<p>Right back at you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Kate Darling.</p>

<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Maya Angelou.</p>
<p>Courage is the most important of all the virtues,</p>
<p>because without courage, you can&rsquo;t practice</p>
<p>any other virtue consistently.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you</p>
<p>next time.</p>
