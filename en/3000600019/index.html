    <ul>
<li>Good afternoon, everybody.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ann Harrison.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the Dean at the Haas School of Business.</p>
<p>Welcome on this beautiful sunny day.</p>
<p>This is a very special Dean&rsquo;s Speaker Series.</p>
<p>It is co-sponsored by the Haas Veterans Club.</p>
<p>I am deeply honored to introduce General Stanley McChrystal,</p>
<p>who is today&rsquo;s distinguished speaker.</p>
<p>General McChrystal was educated at West Point,</p>
<p>the US Naval War College,</p>
<p>and Harvard&rsquo;s John F. Kennedy School of Government.</p>
<p>He has practiced and established effective leadership</p>
<p>throughout his army career,</p>
<p>which has included numerous leadership and staff positions.</p>
<p>Most notably from 2003 to 2008,</p>
<p>General McChrystal commanded</p>
<p>the Joint Special Operations Command</p>
<p>with responsibility for leading</p>
<p>the nation&rsquo;s deployed military counter terrorism efforts</p>
<p>around the globe.</p>
<p>In 2009, he received his fourth star</p>
<p>and assumed command of all international forces</p>
<p>in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>In 2011, General McChrystal founded the McChrystal Group,</p>
<p>an advisory services firm that encourages businesses</p>
<p>to challenge the hierarchical command and control approach</p>
<p>to organizational management.</p>
<p>A passionate advocate for national service,</p>
<p>McChrystal is the Chair</p>
<p>of the Board of Service Year Alliance,</p>
<p>which envisions a future in which a service year</p>
<p>is a cultural expectation for every young American.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also a Senior Fellow at Yale University&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Jackson Institute for Global Affairs,</p>
<p>where he teaches a popular course on leadership</p>
<p>and is a bestselling author of a number of leadership books.</p>
<p>General McChrystal, thank you so much</p>
<p>for taking the time to speak with us today.</p>
<p>We are so grateful you are here,</p>
<p>and we are really looking forward to today&rsquo;s discussion.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s conversation will be led by two MBA students,</p>
<p>both veterans, and part of our Haas Veterans Club.</p>
<p>We will have time for audience questions</p>
<p>after the conversation.</p>
<p>So Nate, go ahead, and let&rsquo;s get started.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, General.</li>
</ul>
<p>My name&rsquo;s Nate Mason.</p>
<p>I enlisted in the Air Force,</p>
<p>inspired by the attacks of 9/11,</p>
<p>and actually end up serving 12 years on active duty</p>
<p>before separating.</p>
<p>Thanks for being here.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[General McChrystal] Thanks for having me. It&rsquo;s an honor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My first question, sir, is when you were a young officer,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>you were taught to trust your gut,</p>
<p>to go with your instincts,</p>
<p>but later you said that mindset was wrong.</p>
<p>At Haas we&rsquo;re taught to make data driven decisions.</p>
<p>I believe decision making takes a balanced approach</p>
<p>of trusting your gut and using data.</p>
<p>Do you still believe trusting your gut is wrong?</p>
<p>And if not, like what changed your mind?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a single answer to this</li>
</ul>
<p>because the answer is if you have enough data,</p>
<p>theoretically, you have the answer to the problem,</p>
<p>but we almost never have enough data.</p>
<p>And if we have a lot of data,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know if we have all the data that we need.</p>
<p>And so the answer is, I think it&rsquo;s always a combination.</p>
<p>What I would say is the best approach that I find</p>
<p>is first to be voracious about trying to get information</p>
<p>that informs you about the problem</p>
<p>or the decision you&rsquo;re gonna make,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t be scared to make a decision</p>
<p>with your instincts either.</p>
<p>Often you know so much more than you think you do.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also, one of the biggest challenges I&rsquo;ve seen is</p>
<p>people will try get more and more information</p>
<p>to mitigate the risk that they&rsquo;re wrong down to zero.</p>
<p>And by the time you&rsquo;ve gathered that much information,</p>
<p>the opportunity&rsquo;s passed or the risk is arrived.</p>
<p>So the reality is it&rsquo;s always a balance,</p>
<p>and you are gonna have to</p>
<p>unless things change dramatically,</p>
<p>go an awful lot with your instincts.</p>
<p>Often more than you really would like to.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recently, I had a class with Angela Duckworth,</p>
<p>an American author and researcher</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s best known for research on grit,</p>
<p>a strength she defines as passion and perseverance</p>
<p>for long term goals.</p>
<p>Her research found a positive correlation</p>
<p>between grit and highly successful people.</p>
<p>What would it be if you had to name one characteristic</p>
<p>of your most successful leaders?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, this is an interesting one</li>
</ul>
<p>because we could sort of hang it on the word successful.</p>
<p>If somebody is an effective leader,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re a good person.</p>
<p>It also doesn&rsquo;t, because if we say successful,</p>
<p>I mean, in that mind,</p>
<p>Adolf Hitler was successful too by many metrics,</p>
<p>and there are a number of other people</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t admire their efforts or the outcome,</p>
<p>but they were effective at what they did</p>
<p>and therefore you could argue successful.</p>
<p>But what I would say, I think the most important thing,</p>
<p>without trying to dance around that is I agree</p>
<p>with the idea of grit in generally successful</p>
<p>in accomplishing what you want to do.</p>
<p>I think empathy is critical for leaders.</p>
<p>And when I say empathy, I don&rsquo;t mean sympathy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean rubbing people&rsquo;s back and making &rsquo;em feel good.</p>
<p>What I mean is the ability to put yourself in a position</p>
<p>where you can respect</p>
<p>what the other person&rsquo;s perspective is.</p>
<p>Be able to put yourself on the other side of the table</p>
<p>and understand that the people you&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>or leading are probably and usually are rational people.</p>
<p>They have a view.</p>
<p>They have a mindset that is a result</p>
<p>of their life experience to that point.</p>
<p>And so sometimes we think that if I speak louder</p>
<p>or if I have a very clever argument,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna talk people into a different perspective on life.</p>
<p>And I found that that&rsquo;s typically not the outcome.</p>
<p>Typically, if you are empathetic enough</p>
<p>to respect people&rsquo;s viewpoints, then you have an ability,</p>
<p>a starting point to start and connect to them.</p>
<p>And in many cases provide the kind of leadership</p>
<p>that is effective.</p>
<ul>
<li>General, in your book &ldquo;Team of Teams,&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>you describe a gardener analogy to leadership.</p>
<p>Can you briefly describe that approach to the group?</p>
<p>And then the second part,</p>
<p>how can leaders create and foster that type of environment?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I&rsquo;m happy to.</li>
</ul>
<p>And I really came up with that gardener analogy</p>
<p>from working in my mother&rsquo;s garden when I was a kid.</p>
<p>Where I was sort of unskilled labor carrying stuff around,</p>
<p>but the reality is for much of the leadership training</p>
<p>that I got, it was really sort of based on the idea</p>
<p>of being a chess master.</p>
<p>And it was designed to build as much competence as you could</p>
<p>at the military art in the case of military leadership,</p>
<p>and in the ability to be a strategist.</p>
<p>And that crosses beyond just military.</p>
<p>But the idea is, if you are a brilliant strategist,</p>
<p>you maneuver your organization like chess pieces on a board.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re better than your opponent,</p>
<p>then your organization will be more successful than theirs.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll win the battle or the business interaction.</p>
<p>What I found in the later parts of my career</p>
<p>as I got into increasingly complex environments,</p>
<p>and I think this is more and more true in the modern ages,</p>
<p>variables and the speed of things increase.</p>
<p>Therefore the complexity of the environment</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re operating at increases.</p>
<p>What I found is that doesn&rsquo;t really work</p>
<p>because I haven&rsquo;t run into anybody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good enough to do that in that kind of environment.</p>
<p>Even though we have this siren&rsquo;s call of modern technology,</p>
<p>where I can talk to anybody with a cell phone,</p>
<p>connect with &rsquo;em,</p>
<p>I can see where they are using unmanned aerial vehicles</p>
<p>or tracking systems.</p>
<p>So if I wanna micromanage,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got more tools than any time in history,</p>
<p>but I would argue that this is exactly the time</p>
<p>we need to take the opposite approach.</p>
<p>Because in a complex environment,</p>
<p>what I have found works best</p>
<p>is to take this gardener approach.</p>
<p>And that is really the gardener creates the garden.</p>
<p>The gardener doesn&rsquo;t grow anything, only plants do that.</p>
<p>But the gardener creates an environment</p>
<p>where plants do that which only plants can do.</p>
<p>And so the idea of the gardener is somewhat less ego driven,</p>
<p>somewhat less leader centric,</p>
<p>but the gardener creates this opportunity</p>
<p>for the people in this case in the organization to do more,</p>
<p>to be more effective themselves.</p>
<p>Instead of being chess pieces, in fact,</p>
<p>they are thinking, acting, decision making entities,</p>
<p>and what I found in a very complex environment</p>
<p>that is far more effective.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also, has second and third order effects</p>
<p>of helping develop people over time.</p>
<p>Will you have some missteps?</p>
<p>Will you have some junior leaders</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t yet have the experience or the competence</p>
<p>to get it right all the time?</p>
<p>You will.</p>
<p>But the reality is I believe that in the aggregate</p>
<p>you have fewer mistakes and a much better outcome</p>
<p>when you push that down to people lower in the organization,</p>
<p>closer to the problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the &ldquo;Team of Teams&rdquo; framework is trust.</li>
</ul>
<p>With more and more companies allowing employees</p>
<p>to work remotely, how can you effectively build trust</p>
<p>across organizations in the remote setting?</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m not sure we know yet to be honest.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think we have a lot of theories about it.</p>
<p>And we say we are going to trust you.</p>
<p>And trust goes both ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the organization, trust up into the organization,</p>
<p>to the values of the organization, to their leaders,</p>
<p>to their fellow teammates.</p>
<p>But in my experience,</p>
<p>much of trust comes from a lot of interaction.</p>
<p>You know, I often jokingly ask people,</p>
<p>who do they or what do they trust?</p>
<p>And they say, well, I trust my family or my pastor</p>
<p>or my best friends.</p>
<p>And I typically go, you trust McDonald&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and they go, no, I don&rsquo;t. You know, I don&rsquo;t like that food.</p>
<p>And I say, you do trust it</p>
<p>because when you see the sign on the roadway,</p>
<p>you know what to expect.</p>
<p>They have through repeated interactions convinced you</p>
<p>that you know about how good the quality will be,</p>
<p>about how clean it will be, exactly what it will cost.</p>
<p>And therefore you can make a decision</p>
<p>based upon a level of trust, and you go or don&rsquo;t go there.</p>
<p>And so I think in organizations where we are remote,</p>
<p>we are gonna have to take a journey here</p>
<p>and figure out what really builds that trust.</p>
<p>What gives us enough interactions, where I, for example,</p>
<p>would trust your good intentions and your competence.</p>
<p>Because if you say you&rsquo;re gonna do something,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotta trust both of those.</p>
<p>One I think you&rsquo;re gonna do it for, you know,</p>
<p>my best outcome,</p>
<p>but also that you&rsquo;re capable of delivering what you say.</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s gonna take us a little while,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll vary for different organizations and people,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s a journey that&rsquo;s really just starting.</p>
<ul>
<li>In your book &ldquo;Leaders,&rdquo; you debunk what you call</li>
</ul>
<p>the attribution myth,</p>
<p>which purports that successes and failures of a team</p>
<p>are all the results of its leader,</p>
<p>which I know is really big in the army.</p>
<p>Instead, you suggest that the best leaders,</p>
<p>like you mentioned a little bit earlier,</p>
<p>are those who are able to maximize</p>
<p>their team members&rsquo; potential</p>
<p>without putting themselves on a pedestal.</p>
<p>Here at Haas, we have a lot of people</p>
<p>who will soon be in situations</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;ll want to make a lot of impact.</p>
<p>What would you recommend to them</p>
<p>to attempt to make that impact</p>
<p>without putting themselves on a pedestal</p>
<p>or trying to do too much?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a really interesting tension</li>
</ul>
<p>because it pulls in several directions, not just two.</p>
<p>First off, when I left the military</p>
<p>along with a great young man</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s just graduating from Yale Law School,</p>
<p>I wrote my memoirs, and it was a humbling experience</p>
<p>because you write your memoirs,</p>
<p>you know what happened because you were there.</p>
<p>Well, the reality is we spent two and a half years</p>
<p>researching all the parts of my life</p>
<p>that were interesting enough to include in memoirs</p>
<p>or at least I thought they were.</p>
<p>And what we found when we did all these interviews</p>
<p>is in many cases, I had a pretty superficial view</p>
<p>of what had happened in a case.</p>
<p>We had, I&rsquo;d made a decision.</p>
<p>This had been the outcome.</p>
<p>And so I connected my decision to the outcome.</p>
<p>And then when we did interviews and got more background,</p>
<p>we found in many cases</p>
<p>were all these other things happening</p>
<p>that had much greater actual causation</p>
<p>to what happened than my great or bad decision.</p>
<p>And so I suddenly stepped back and said</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even the star of my own memoirs.</p>
<p>The reality is things are much more complex than that.</p>
<p>And so the idea that the leader is the person that causes</p>
<p>the corporation to be successful or the country to do it,</p>
<p>or the team to win,</p>
<p>whatever, you know, you want to connect it to</p>
<p>is usually a gross oversimplification.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s partly the way we write history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also reinforced by things like our incentive programs.</p>
<p>If someone leads an organization, they want to get credit,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;ll get promoted.</p>
<p>Or if they&rsquo;re in a financial thing, they want to get credit</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;ll be paid more.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a temptation to try to personify</p>
<p>to say that&rsquo;s the reason we succeeded or didn&rsquo;t succeed.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not trying to say that leaders are not important.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>And other members of organizations are very important.</p>
<p>But I think that when we try to attribute the outcomes</p>
<p>to one or even a small number of people,</p>
<p>we run a great risk of putting the spotlight</p>
<p>on a single person,</p>
<p>ignoring everything that&rsquo;s right out of that field of view</p>
<p>and missing the actual full story.</p>
<p>And when we think about that further,</p>
<p>and we talk about creating good organizations,</p>
<p>we start to say, well, if we go get a great quarterback</p>
<p>or a great coach we&rsquo;ve solved the problem.</p>
<p>And actually the organizations that do best</p>
<p>build organizations.</p>
<p>They build full teams, and they are then less reliant</p>
<p>on the superstar CEO or something like that.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s important we not, you know, bow down</p>
<p>or salute every time we pass somebody up on a pedestal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>In one of your TED talks,</p>
<p>you mentioned that leaders can let you fail</p>
<p>without making you feel like a failure.</p>
<p>And that leaders increasingly need to adapt to environments</p>
<p>and teams where they may not have expertise.</p>
<p>And you mentioned this a little bit earlier</p>
<p>in the complex environments.</p>
<p>What advice do you have for MBA students</p>
<p>who will soon be leading diverse teams</p>
<p>with divergent skill sets,</p>
<p>where they may not have expertise?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, it&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m gonna take both of those,</li>
</ul>
<p>&lsquo;cause you mentioned the first part</p>
<p>about you can fail without being a failure</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>because if we have a sense that we cannot fail</p>
<p>without being a failure, and the military,</p>
<p>the army particularly has a bad habit</p>
<p>of zero defect situations.</p>
<p>If you get anything significant on your record,</p>
<p>an officer or senior NCO is not likely to move</p>
<p>to the next level of promotion or responsibility.</p>
<p>What that does, it&rsquo;s insidious.</p>
<p>You say, well, what we&rsquo;re gonna do</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re gonna pull out the people who don&rsquo;t do well.</p>
<p>What you do is you cause people</p>
<p>to be extraordinarily risk averse</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t want to take a chance</p>
<p>where they could get a ding.</p>
<p>And the problem with that of course is there are less dings,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also less accomplished</p>
<p>because people are unwilling to take the kind of risks.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not talking about</p>
<p>being frivolous with people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about risks in reasonable things</p>
<p>that produce greater outcomes.</p>
<p>The other part of that you talk about is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna go into organizations,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not gonna be the expert.</p>
<p>Well, in some cases you will.</p>
<p>In some cases, you&rsquo;ll be a very narrow expert</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ll be the person most informed on a single issue.</p>
<p>But as soon as you get more senior</p>
<p>that will become less and less the case.</p>
<p>You may have more experience, more instinct,</p>
<p>more general kind of ability to add to it,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll have less granular information.</p>
<p>And I remember as I got more senior in the army,</p>
<p>another senior leader, I said,</p>
<p>how do you get briefed 15 times day?</p>
<p>And someone comes in and briefs you</p>
<p>on a pretty complicated thing, and you,</p>
<p>how do you make a decision?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cause there&rsquo;s no way you can understand</p>
<p>all of the background information</p>
<p>and the data the person puts in front of you</p>
<p>for that decision.</p>
<p>He said, well, what you learn to do is judge the briefer.</p>
<p>You learn to judge whether that person speaking to you</p>
<p>has credibility.</p>
<p>If they have a track record, that&rsquo;s very useful.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t have a track record,</p>
<p>you learn to get an instinctual response.</p>
<p>Does that person seem to know?</p>
<p>And really good leaders I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>learn to ask some very strategic questions</p>
<p>that sort of ferret out whether the person</p>
<p>one understands what they&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>and two is it rational?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still not foolproof because, as you know,</p>
<p>people can come in and they can be very loquacious</p>
<p>and convincing, and in the limits of senior leadership,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve gotta go through decisions, you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>in many cases, you&rsquo;re a little bit vulnerable to that,</p>
<p>but over time you get better and better at it.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;d tell you is particularly as you get senior,</p>
<p>leadership and problem solving is more about people</p>
<p>than it is about the nuts and bolts of the issue.</p>
<p>Particularly as you get the wide swaths of things,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t try to become an expert on all of those.</p>
<p>And if you do, I think it&rsquo;s a fools errand</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ll start to grab onto certain parts of it,</p>
<p>and you won&rsquo;t be able to step back</p>
<p>and make the broader judgements</p>
<p>that I think are really the best way to go.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, that&rsquo;s great.</li>
</ul>
<p>Building on that maybe,</p>
<p>leadership is often used synonymously with management.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve you&rsquo;ve said a lot about both here today.</p>
<p>How would you distinguish between the two?</p>
<p>And what advice do you have for people</p>
<p>who aspire to be good leaders</p>
<p>who are going into managerial positions?</p>
<p>And how would you kind of delineate between those two?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I think that they are not easy</li>
</ul>
<p>to completely separate.</p>
<p>We tend to think of leadership as inspiration</p>
<p>or developing of people,</p>
<p>and we tend to think of management as, you know,</p>
<p>assigning tasks and tracking things.</p>
<p>In 1994, I was commanding a parachute infantry battalion</p>
<p>in the 82nd airborne division.</p>
<p>And on a March morning,</p>
<p>I had paratroopers down at Pope Air Force Base</p>
<p>preparing to do a practice parachute jump.</p>
<p>And there was a freak accident above the airfield.</p>
<p>An F-16 and a C-130 collided.</p>
<p>They later attributed it</p>
<p>to an air traffic control mistake.</p>
<p>And in the process, the F-16 pilot ejected,</p>
<p>and the plane went down and crashed onto the airfield.</p>
<p>Now it crashed onto the airfield,</p>
<p>and it hit a parked airplane, a cargo plane, a C-141,</p>
<p>that was loaded with fuel, but not with people,</p>
<p>and it created a fireball of fuel and wreckage.</p>
<p>And that fireball of fuel and wreckage</p>
<p>went about a hundred more meters</p>
<p>and ran right into where elements of my battalion</p>
<p>and another battalion were preparing for a parachute jump.</p>
<p>So in an instant young paratroopers</p>
<p>were engulfed in flame and wreckage.</p>
<p>21 were killed.</p>
<p>45 were badly injured, in many cases,</p>
<p>burns, amputations, and whatnot.</p>
<p>Now over the next really months,</p>
<p>but really over the next days right after that,</p>
<p>I was a leader who had just had 10% of my battalion</p>
<p>made casualties.</p>
<p>And you expect casualties in war time,</p>
<p>but this was in peace time.</p>
<p>And just in an instant, 10% of the battalion were casualties</p>
<p>of a pretty shocking nature.</p>
<p>Now I had to try to be the best leader I could be</p>
<p>and provide inspiration and interact with people.</p>
<p>But the other thing I had to do was be a manager</p>
<p>because in that moment,</p>
<p>we had to organize our battalion</p>
<p>to provide people to take care of families.</p>
<p>In many cases, there were families that had been left</p>
<p>by somebody who&rsquo;d been killed or wounded.</p>
<p>Other families came in, parents and whatnot,</p>
<p>to take care of people.</p>
<p>We had to arrange meals, hotel rooms, travel,</p>
<p>and then fairly soon we had to arrange burial parties</p>
<p>who go around the country and conduct the burials.</p>
<p>Now in that case you could say</p>
<p>that that second part was logistics, and it was management,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s pretty hard to parse out that management</p>
<p>from leadership because it was so incredibly important.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;d say is good leaders</p>
<p>have gotta be competent managers so people get paid,</p>
<p>so people get healthcare.</p>
<p>So in the case of soldiers, so they get fed,</p>
<p>so that the mess hall, things that seem mundane,</p>
<p>but at the end of the day are the welfare of people,</p>
<p>I think it overlaps into leadership.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s true at every level.</p>
<p>And so I would say that we don&rsquo;t wanna to pretend</p>
<p>that there is more separation than there is.</p>
<p>At the same time,</p>
<p>I think if someone is skewed totally towards management,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>that the other human aspects of leadership,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re unlikely to be as effective in critical moments</p>
<p>as they might be.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all known people who that is their greater strength.</p>
<ul>
<li>Got it.</li>
</ul>
<p>In &ldquo;Leaders,&rdquo; you mentioned lessons you learned</p>
<p>from the leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq.</p>
<p>Can you expand on some of those lessons?</p>
<p>And why did you choose specifically to focus on Zarqawi?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was a young Jordanian</li>
</ul>
<p>who&rsquo;d grown up in the town of Zarqa, an industrial town.</p>
<p>And he had as a young man gotten more, well,</p>
<p>first he had a lot of issues, petty crime.</p>
<p>He was kind of a thug, got into drugs and alcohol,</p>
<p>and his mother put him in a more fundamentalist school.</p>
<p>And then he became more imbued with the tenets of Islam.</p>
<p>And then he went to first to Pakistan then Afghanistan</p>
<p>to try to fight the Soviets.</p>
<p>But he got there after the Soviets</p>
<p>had pulled out of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>So he did operate against the remnants</p>
<p>of the Soviet-backed government</p>
<p>under President Najibullah,</p>
<p>but he became more and more extreme.</p>
<p>He came back to Jordan a few years later</p>
<p>and got himself thrown into prison by the Jordanians</p>
<p>who considered him a dangerous extremist.</p>
<p>And he spent five years in prison.</p>
<p>And during that period, he became more and more extreme,</p>
<p>more and more committed,</p>
<p>more and more fanatical, we would say, or zealous.</p>
<p>He came out of there, went back and formed an organization</p>
<p>that was allied with, but initially not part of Al-Qaeda.</p>
<p>And I tell you this story because he took a road</p>
<p>to get to lead an organization</p>
<p>that eventually became known as Al-Qaeda in Iraq.</p>
<p>He was not particularly well,</p>
<p>in fact, he was not well educated at all,</p>
<p>but he was extraordinarily committed.</p>
<p>He was inflexibly committed to his beliefs.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not always a bad thing.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a reason to admire someone</p>
<p>who believes in something strongly.</p>
<p>Now I believed in something different,</p>
<p>but the reality was he had a level of zealotry</p>
<p>that was very inspirational to people, to bring to him.</p>
<p>And he committed people to a level of extremism</p>
<p>against the government of Iraq</p>
<p>and against American and allied forces</p>
<p>because he was so committed to it.</p>
<p>And he was also a very effective retail leader.</p>
<p>He dealt well with people.</p>
<p>He was kind of soft spoken around those.</p>
<p>He did the things</p>
<p>that people expected a terrorist leader to do.</p>
<p>He dressed the part.</p>
<p>He went out and did operational things.</p>
<p>So I say all of this is</p>
<p>while I very much was opposed to him.</p>
<p>I thought he was a psychopathic murderer.</p>
<p>I also thought he was a very effective leader.</p>
<p>And for two and a half years,</p>
<p>my force fought him, and we ultimately killed him.</p>
<p>But the fact that I thought so different from him,</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t color my admission that he was damn good,</p>
<p>and he almost beat us.</p>
<p>And he almost beat us because he was very good,</p>
<p>not because his cause or whatever.</p>
<p>And so I say that.</p>
<p>And so he had a leadership style</p>
<p>that was fairly decentralized.</p>
<p>It was very flexible, constantly adaptable.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of things.</p>
<p>He probably couldn&rsquo;t walk into a Fortune 500 Company</p>
<p>because he had some other issues.</p>
<p>But the reality is he was, he was good.</p>
<p>And we have got to learn from people who are effective,</p>
<p>not just people we like or agree with.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Nate] One last question for you, General.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I served on active duty,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I spent a career in a joint serve service environment</p>
<p>where it was rare to know the political affiliation</p>
<p>of other service members.</p>
<p>However, political conversations took a turn</p>
<p>later in my career,</p>
<p>and before I separated from the Air Force in 2016,</p>
<p>I noticed a culture shift across the organizations</p>
<p>that embraced overt tribal politics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested to hear your perspective</p>
<p>on how leaders should manage</p>
<p>fast moving corrosive culture shifts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, this is gonna be something</li>
</ul>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna have to learn to do</p>
<p>because my experience was yours.</p>
<p>When I was in the military, we didn&rsquo;t talk politics</p>
<p>of a partisan nature.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know who was a Republican, Democrat or whatever.</p>
<p>It just wasn&rsquo;t considered the right thing to do.</p>
<p>And yet, as we see this growth</p>
<p>in this cultural or tribal politics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost identifying with a part of our society</p>
<p>as opposed to a traditional political party.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty dangerous.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fueled by,</p>
<p>in many cases by misinformation or disinformation.</p>
<p>I think that the first thing we&rsquo;ve gotta do in the military</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;ve gotta stay absolutely focused with people,</p>
<p>the importance of an apolitical military,</p>
<p>and the importance is because if we lose</p>
<p>that nature of our military,</p>
<p>we will be like many other countries</p>
<p>that have had military overthrows on a pretty regular basis</p>
<p>because the military starts to rationalize</p>
<p>that they are the actual stewards of the nation.</p>
<p>And so they will overthrow a civilian government and say,</p>
<p>we actually have the best interests of the people at heart,</p>
<p>and we know best.</p>
<p>And I think in many cases, they actually believe that.</p>
<p>But once you create that dynamic, and the military</p>
<p>who are uniquely armed, and therefore, it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>they are advantaged in a competitive environment.</p>
<p>Then suddenly you don&rsquo;t have a democracy.</p>
<p>You have something different.</p>
<p>You have something that&rsquo;s been corrupted.</p>
<p>I think that we&rsquo;ve gotta start by constantly pushing,</p>
<p>not just to inside our military force but outside,</p>
<p>the importance of an apolitical military.</p>
<p>The second is discipline.</p>
<p>There are certain things you just don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re in the military.</p>
<p>And if you choose to be in the military,</p>
<p>you follow orders.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t do other things.</p>
<p>And so the reality is, I think we&rsquo;ve got to understand</p>
<p>that military people are not like every other citizen</p>
<p>because we give them weapons.</p>
<p>And so the reality is that when a person joins the military,</p>
<p>they make a vow that they are going to follow certain orders</p>
<p>and not become partisan.</p>
<p>I think we need to nail that as well.</p>
<p>And then we need to have a discussion across our nation</p>
<p>that once our political conversation, discussion, argument,</p>
<p>whatever we wanna call it,</p>
<p>once it starts to tip past a certain point,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to get back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of reading</p>
<p>about the decades before the US Civil War recently.</p>
<p>And the reality is there was a period for several decades</p>
<p>where there was always disagreements</p>
<p>between the north and the south political party</p>
<p>and even over slavery.</p>
<p>But then it tipped, and it started to tip about 1850.</p>
<p>And then of course the publication of &ldquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin,&rdquo;</p>
<p>and then it became a cultural disagreement,</p>
<p>not just a political disagreement.</p>
<p>There was always that in the background</p>
<p>and in economic issues, but then it became tribal.</p>
<p>And once it became tribal,</p>
<p>arguably it may have been impossible</p>
<p>to stop the carnage that began in 1861.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we don&rsquo;t want to see in my view.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thank you, General.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call me Stan, please.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Come on, guys.</p>
<p>We talked about that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been called a lot worse, so don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Okay, Stan, if I may.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[General McChrystal] Please.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So we have time for question from the audience,</p>
<p>and this is a wonderful opportunity.</p>
<p>So if any of you would like to go to the mics</p>
<p>and ask a question of General Stan, please do so.</p>
<p>And can you please identify yourselves also?</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, Stan.</li>
</ul>
<p>My name is Peter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a full-time MBA.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for being here with us.</p>
<p>So here at Berkeley Haas,</p>
<p>one of the core tenets of our school</p>
<p>is to learn how to challenge the status quo.</p>
<p>So you mentioned that in the military</p>
<p>you have to follow orders from your commanding officers,</p>
<p>not really much of a dialogue,</p>
<p>you just do what he or she tells you.</p>
<p>So how do you reconcile that</p>
<p>with becoming an independent thinker who uses your autonomy</p>
<p>to make important decisions?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a great question.</li>
</ul>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a tension in the military and always has been.</p>
<p>You want iconoclastic thinkers who will question doctrine,</p>
<p>who will question processes in the military,</p>
<p>who will push the bounds of the way things are done.</p>
<p>Look at Billy Mitchell with air power,</p>
<p>and there are always history like that.</p>
<p>However, there is a time for that and a way to do that,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a time not to do that.</p>
<p>As I tell people, you know,</p>
<p>when the landing craft hits Omaha beach and the ramp drops,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the time for people to question</p>
<p>whether this is a good idea.</p>
<p>That is the time when you follow through and execute.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit of art.</p>
<p>I mean, people have gotta understand</p>
<p>there is a time in a warm, cool, dry, calm place</p>
<p>where you can push things.</p>
<p>And you can have that conversation,</p>
<p>even with your very senior leaders.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a time for the kind of character attacks</p>
<p>or arguments that weaken the institution</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t a conversation.</p>
<p>Many of you, and I doubt many of you are married</p>
<p>at this point, but if you are,</p>
<p>you know that a marriage consists</p>
<p>of a number of conversations,</p>
<p>and those conversations have gotta be conducted carefully</p>
<p>within a certain rule set</p>
<p>because once you cross by,</p>
<p>cross outside too often and too far,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to resurrect it.</p>
<p>And so I would say that&rsquo;s kind of the way it is</p>
<p>in the military.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we too often become too rank conscious,</p>
<p>too status quo conscious, too limited.</p>
<p>And so I think we can push the bounds courteously,</p>
<p>respectfully a little more than we do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, sir.</li>
</ul>
<p>My name is Emma Levy, and I&rsquo;m a second year MBA.</p>
<p>I was an analyst at the McChrystal Group back in 2013.</p>
<p>It was my first job outta college</p>
<p>and remains a really foundational part of my career.</p>
<p>And I know the McChrystal Group.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[General McChrystal] Thanks for all you&rsquo;ve done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good to see you again.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So I know the McChrystal Group has changed and evolved</p>
<p>since I was there in 2013.</p>
<p>I left in 2014 to go back to grad school,</p>
<p>but I was wondering if you could share an example</p>
<p>for how the application of your leadership principles</p>
<p>has transformed corporations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, and that&rsquo;s a really good question,</li>
</ul>
<p>and again thanks for all you&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>What we do is we try to partner with organizations</p>
<p>basically to unlock their capacity.</p>
<p>You know, most organizations,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got pretty good people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got, they&rsquo;re in a good market, or if they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>those are problems that we really can&rsquo;t take on for &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve gotta, they&rsquo;ve gotta have certain things,</p>
<p>but what we can do is we can unlock their ability.</p>
<p>So what we found is there are several things</p>
<p>that work pretty well.</p>
<p>First is to understand the problem and do a diagnostic</p>
<p>to get down and see why the engine&rsquo;s running rough.</p>
<p>The second is to get an operating rhythm that works.</p>
<p>That seems, that seems so basic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a schedule.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how you do things.</p>
<p>You control interactions, and people say, ah, that&rsquo;s basic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s simple stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually not.</p>
<p>Creating an effective operating rhythm</p>
<p>that creates processes and passes information</p>
<p>on a constant basis is key.</p>
<p>Creating decision space,</p>
<p>identifying what decisions are made where,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not inflexible,</p>
<p>but it creates the ability for decisions.</p>
<p>And the heart of that, of course, is communication.</p>
<p>At the end of the day,</p>
<p>I would say that the most important thing</p>
<p>that organizations seek</p>
<p>is what we call shared consciousness.</p>
<p>And that is a common, contextual understanding</p>
<p>of what the organization&rsquo;s trying to do</p>
<p>and what the situation is in the moment.</p>
<p>And therefore people are empowered to make decisions</p>
<p>down at a lower level</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re now armed with information</p>
<p>and not just authorities, but expectations</p>
<p>that they make decisions closer to the problem.</p>
<p>And we found tremendous success as organizations do this.</p>
<p>And again, it sounds basic, but it&rsquo;s really easy to say.</p>
<p>And, as you know, really hard to do.</p>
<p>A little bit like, you know, doing a nuclear reaction,</p>
<p>you bring a bunch of things together</p>
<p>and think it&rsquo;s gonna work.</p>
<p>Well, you can have a really bad outcome</p>
<p>or you can produce great energy.</p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Emma] Yeah, thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My question is in regards to your involvement</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>From what I understand, you played a significant role</p>
<p>back in 2009 and pushing for</p>
<p>tens of thousands of more troops to be sent to Afghanistan</p>
<p>as part of a counterinsurgency strategy.</p>
<p>And basically to give time to the US to train</p>
<p>and build a larger Afghan National Army Police Force,</p>
<p>and in a meeting with Biden,</p>
<p>you along with Petraeus and others were asked, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the government&rsquo;s a criminal syndicate a year from now,</p>
<p>&ldquo;how will the troops make a difference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quote, &ldquo;if a year from now,</p>
<p>&ldquo;there is no demonstrable progress in governments,</p>
<p>&ldquo;what do we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And according to Woodward &ldquo;Obama&rsquo;s Wars,&rdquo;</p>
<p>no one in that room recorded an answer in their notes.</p>
<p>You later admitted in an interview last year, that quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we sat around a table ever</p>
<p>&ldquo;and talked about where this is going to be in 20 years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s documented extensively how leading US generals</p>
<p>and officials have lied profusely</p>
<p>regarding the wars following 9/11</p>
<p>and the quote unquote progress that they were making.</p>
<p>And none of them have been punished yet for their deceit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve of course continued on in building a career</p>
<p>after your time in the military.</p>
<p>And as we know, Afghanistan is now in complete shambles.</p>
<p>There are nearly 20 million people on the verge of famine,</p>
<p>millions of others that are now refugees,</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands civilians killed,</p>
<p>and thousands of our own troops dead as well,</p>
<p>all for the price of over $2 trillion.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like serving in the military.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like being in a position of authority</p>
<p>where you need to make decisions with limited information.</p>
<p>But what I do know is that when people are put</p>
<p>into extremely high positions of power,</p>
<p>they deserve greater scrutiny as well.</p>
<p>And so my two part question is one,</p>
<p>do you believe you share any responsibility,</p>
<p>an iota of accountability</p>
<p>in the current humanitarian crisis,</p>
<p>the largest of its kind right now in Afghanistan?</p>
<p>And two, what is the US military</p>
<p>and the US government&rsquo;s responsibility</p>
<p>in uplifting a people whose country that we helped destroy?</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m not sure what you want my response to be here.</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, that was more speech than question.</p>
<p>I have a different view.</p>
<p>I believe, and I will tell you what I saw.</p>
<p>I saw from 2002 on,</p>
<p>which is the first time I actually went to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>I saw forces from the west,</p>
<p>the United States being the preponderance,</p>
<p>go there and find a country that was literally in tatters</p>
<p>from almost 20 years of war at that point.</p>
<p>As you remember, 10 years of war against the Soviets</p>
<p>and then a brutal civil war,</p>
<p>and first amongst the Muj groups</p>
<p>and then with the Taliban.</p>
<p>So when we arrived in 2002,</p>
<p>there was a requirement in Afghanistan</p>
<p>for the Afghans to put back a nation, put it together.</p>
<p>And yet the pieces were in pretty bad shape.</p>
<p>So you run into a pretty difficult situation.</p>
<p>There was an argument that says</p>
<p>we should have turned our backs</p>
<p>and walked away at that point.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not the decisions that were made.</p>
<p>And I personally think that that would&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>a very difficult decision to make.</p>
<p>The actions that I saw after that, every year,</p>
<p>and I was there part of every year from 2002</p>
<p>until I left the service in 2010.</p>
<p>I never saw the version</p>
<p>that some of your question described,</p>
<p>I never saw stupid people.</p>
<p>I never saw people lying about the situation.</p>
<p>I never saw the kinds of things that you either believe</p>
<p>or the tone of the question.</p>
<p>What I saw was good people working hard,</p>
<p>trying to get a good outcome.</p>
<p>Now we didn&rsquo;t get a good outcome,</p>
<p>which ought to give us an awful lot of cause</p>
<p>because if we do have good people</p>
<p>trying very hard to get a good outcome,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t get the outcome we want,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually more disturbing</p>
<p>than if we can find some generals who lied</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Because in reality, if we do, give it our best shot,</p>
<p>and we struggle, then I think gotta look at</p>
<p>a whole bunch of things, processes and whatnot.</p>
<p>You ask the question whether I feel responsible?</p>
<p>Of course I do.</p>
<p>I believe, well, lemme put it this way.</p>
<p>I only know what my intentions were at my decisions were,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m very comfortable with what my intentions were.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think all my decisions were right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;ll be many senior leaders</p>
<p>who claim that every decision they made was right.</p>
<p>But the reality is I think that as I look at the decisions</p>
<p>of others as well, I think there was a good faith effort,</p>
<p>a lot of, again, a lot of mistakes made,</p>
<p>but I think that you probably oversimplify it</p>
<p>in my interpretation,</p>
<p>in the way that you&rsquo;ve concluded.</p>
<p>And as we go into a situation like this again,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;ve gotta do is be able to step back and say,</p>
<p>okay, how are we gonna get better next time?</p>
<p>One morally, will we make the decision to do anything?</p>
<p>Will we just say, well, we touched the stove,</p>
<p>and it was too hot, and therefore, we can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>And I would point to things like Rwanda,</p>
<p>where we made the decision to do nothing.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s certainly questions</p>
<p>about whether we would do that particular decision again,</p>
<p>but this is what&rsquo;s gonna make it hard.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think studying this kind of thing</p>
<p>is of value for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you so much, General.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Can you please identify yourself?</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, my name&rsquo;s Austin Lavin Fulton, MBA Class of 2022.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna be a tough act to follow.</p>
<p>My question&rsquo;s a little easier.</p>
<p>So prior to Haas, I worked for the Intel community</p>
<p>and served as a consultant for the IC.</p>
<p>In my time in the IC, I learned that faith</p>
<p>and democratic institutions are really key</p>
<p>to a country&rsquo;s stability.</p>
<p>My question for you is</p>
<p>how do we get faith in democratic institutions in the states</p>
<p>back on track, given the fact that right now</p>
<p>the faith is at an all time low</p>
<p>given like corrosive political commentary?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I agree with you completely</li>
</ul>
<p>that the most important thing</p>
<p>is to have faith in our democratic institutions</p>
<p>to include elections.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;ve been undermined by misinformation,</p>
<p>disinformation, and also by some people</p>
<p>who have conducted themselves in a way</p>
<p>that I think gives us a big question mark</p>
<p>in whether our institutions are as strong</p>
<p>and provide as fair an outcome as they need to.</p>
<p>The problem is now, even if they do provide that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s enough people who doubt it,</p>
<p>that it gets a certain reality in perception.</p>
<p>And if people doubt that the outcome in fact</p>
<p>is either real or, you know,</p>
<p>reflects the will of the people,</p>
<p>then you suddenly are unfettered.</p>
<p>You can make an argument that says,</p>
<p>if the election was not fair,</p>
<p>then why should I limit my actions</p>
<p>to those things within the law?</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t I use violence or other things</p>
<p>to overthrow the government?</p>
<p>Because the foundation</p>
<p>upon which the legitimacy of the government,</p>
<p>which is the validity of elections, is in doubt.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why this is so incredibly important.</p>
<p>So incredibly sacred.</p>
<p>And yet we are trying to figure out in this new environment</p>
<p>of the way information flows and whatnot</p>
<p>how to deal with it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure that we,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re mature enough yet as a society</p>
<p>for the information technology we have at our fingertips.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve got more power</p>
<p>than we have maturity to use it</p>
<p>because we can, as we know, we can influence people</p>
<p>in ways that are pretty dangerous.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Austin] Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m George.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I work for the Department of Energy,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m intimately familiar</p>
<p>with the command and control structure</p>
<p>and the serial defect policies you describe.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;m forbidden to make Third Reich comparisons at work,</p>
<p>but you started in the beginning with, you know,</p>
<p>Adolf Hitler was a very efficient leader.</p>
<p>So thank you for that, I&rsquo;m gonna bring that to work.</p>
<p>But to my question, if you have an organization</p>
<p>that is very command and control,</p>
<p>how did you manage to get the decisions down to the people?</p>
<p>And how did you, I guess,</p>
<p>manage up and like stand behind the shift</p>
<p>in organizational structure there?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, well, imperfectly would be the answer,</li>
</ul>
<p>but the reality is the military is perceived</p>
<p>as the ultimate command and control organization.</p>
<p>The ranks are clear, the chain of command,</p>
<p>and everybody thinks that if a leader in the,</p>
<p>military leader tells the organization to go left,</p>
<p>it all goes left.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not really accurate.</p>
<p>The reality is it&rsquo;s much more like a civilian organization.</p>
<p>On the parade ground, privates will follow a Sergeant</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s an environment,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re certainly frightened of the Sergeant there,</p>
<p>but in combat, they&rsquo;re more frightened of the enemy.</p>
<p>And so the reality is they do things for leaders</p>
<p>in difficult environments,</p>
<p>and particularly when you are spread out.</p>
<p>So the leadership that is needed to be effective</p>
<p>in that situation is much more</p>
<p>the influence kind of leadership and inspiration,</p>
<p>and them trusting that the decisions made by their leaders</p>
<p>are in the best interest of them, that individual soldier,</p>
<p>but also of the cause for which they fight.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always institutional pressures on organizations</p>
<p>if you try to change as we tried to change</p>
<p>at the counter-terrorist world.</p>
<p>When we pushed things a certain way,</p>
<p>there would be almost an equal and opposite reaction</p>
<p>that says, no, you can&rsquo;t do &rsquo;em that way</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve not done it that way before.</p>
<p>I found, in some cases, you&rsquo;ve gotta make the argument</p>
<p>to senior leaders, and you gotta go up and say,</p>
<p>this is what we have to do.</p>
<p>And I had a fair amount of success</p>
<p>because the moment that was most difficult,</p>
<p>and that was the Iraq years from 2003 to 2008,</p>
<p>people felt like it was very necessary</p>
<p>to do something different.</p>
<p>So I think we got additional leeway to do things</p>
<p>that we probably wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten</p>
<p>in a peace time environment.</p>
<p>It just, the bureaucracy sort of closes in on you.</p>
<p>And then there are times when you&rsquo;ve just gotta act.</p>
<p>There are times when you have gotta act</p>
<p>and seek forgiveness.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t mean you are trying to be disloyal</p>
<p>or trying to violate things.</p>
<p>That just means there are times</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve gotta push the boundaries</p>
<p>because if everybody waits and asks detailed instructions</p>
<p>for everything they do,</p>
<p>that will cause an organization to seize up</p>
<p>just as badly as the leader.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just a micromanaging leader</p>
<p>that can be the problem.</p>
<p>It can be a lack of willingness on the part of people</p>
<p>down in the organization to push and accept responsibility</p>
<p>and in some cases put themselves a little bit at risk</p>
<p>to do that.</p>
<p>And a lot of the organizations we deal with today,</p>
<p>what leaders will tell us is they are most frustrated</p>
<p>by the decisions their subordinates won&rsquo;t make.</p>
<p>You know, we talk about risk and whatnot.</p>
<p>And they say, I keep telling my subordinates</p>
<p>to take more risk.</p>
<p>And of course that&rsquo;s a trust issue,</p>
<p>but I think it goes both ways.</p>
<p>And so junior people at times</p>
<p>have gotta be willing to push that.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[George] All right, thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hello, my name is Danny M.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m a current senior studying electrical engineering</p>
<p>here in the undergraduate program here at Berkeley.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also an Army ROTC Cadet.</p>
<p>And I actually had a question,</p>
<p>with our army currently rapidly changing</p>
<p>and our society and country as a whole</p>
<p>rapidly getting polarized, I was just wondering, you know,</p>
<p>you were in the same shoes as me one time,</p>
<p>and I was wondering if you had any advice</p>
<p>for junior officers or, you know, soon-to-be lieutenants.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, sure, I think the age, I came out in 19,</li>
</ul>
<p>I went into West Point in 1972.</p>
<p>It was a pretty polarized period.</p>
<p>The 60s were pretty difficult.</p>
<p>&lsquo;72 the army was in a pretty difficult way.</p>
<p>It was coming out of Vietnam</p>
<p>and not coming out in a healthy way.</p>
<p>And so I graduated from West Point in &lsquo;76.</p>
<p>Things had gotten a little bit better,</p>
<p>but I will tell you that my experience was</p>
<p>it starts at home.</p>
<p>And when I say at home, it starts with the individual.</p>
<p>The most important thing I think each of us can do</p>
<p>is sort of figure out who we are and what our values are.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be pressured in many ways,</p>
<p>not always intentional and not evilly, but organizations,</p>
<p>your friends, society,</p>
<p>everything is gonna push you in multiple directions.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna have to decide who you are.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an extraordinarily good article,</p>
<p>&ldquo;The World of Epictetus,&rdquo; written by James Stockdale,</p>
<p>which describes his time at the Hanoi Hilton.</p>
<p>And of course in an era, when for five years,</p>
<p>he loses all control over his physical life.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s tortured, he&rsquo;s abused.</p>
<p>He can do, he can make no decisions</p>
<p>that we would take for granted on a daily basis.</p>
<p>What he learns is what he can hold onto is his values,</p>
<p>the identity that he sees for himself,</p>
<p>his personal narrative.</p>
<p>And I think many of us don&rsquo;t spend enough time on that,</p>
<p>trying to do that.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean that I think at a young age,</p>
<p>everyone should know exactly who you are</p>
<p>and everything you believe in</p>
<p>and therefore you become inflexible</p>
<p>for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>I think you will, like all of us, you&rsquo;ll mature and grow,</p>
<p>but I think paying attention to that,</p>
<p>understanding the importance of that journey.</p>
<p>I think the most important things in my life</p>
<p>besides some of the key relationships that I value heavily</p>
<p>are the idea that I want to be somebody</p>
<p>that I can look in the mirror and feel comfortable with.</p>
<p>I want my granddaughters to be able to look at me</p>
<p>or read about me and have some sense</p>
<p>that I was somebody that they could be comfortable about</p>
<p>and proud of, and whatever a person metrics for that are,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I tell you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more important than learning how to fire maneuvers</p>
<p>as a Lieutenant.</p>
<p>You get that part right, and everything else gets easier.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Roger, thank you, sir.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[General McChrystal] Thank you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, Stan.</li>
</ul>
<p>My name is Rohan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a third year year at the undergraduate Haas program.</p>
<p>I was sort of wondering, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been hearing a lot in the media,</p>
<p>both on both sides of the aisle</p>
<p>that people are sort of very bearish</p>
<p>about America right now.</p>
<p>What is sort of one contrarian argument that you have</p>
<p>in the case that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sort of very optimistic about America?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s sort of one reason in that respect?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, if I&rsquo;m optimistic about America,</li>
</ul>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be because generations that come up,</p>
<p>and this just sounds like a trite answer, but America is,</p>
<p>our history is interesting,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t define who we are because that&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the reality anymore.</p>
<p>The reality is who we are now</p>
<p>and who we decide to be going forward.</p>
<p>So if there is reason for optimism,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the room with you now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in other rooms like this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in young people who make a decision</p>
<p>on what they&rsquo;re gonna do.</p>
<p>And in some cases, people my age make a decision</p>
<p>on what values we&rsquo;re gonna support.</p>
<p>You know, too often we say we&rsquo;re exceptional.</p>
<p>America is an exceptional country.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>America is a country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exceptional if we get up this morning</p>
<p>and act exceptionally.</p>
<p>And if we get up tomorrow morning,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t act exceptionally,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not exceptional anymore.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing, there&rsquo;s no greater being</p>
<p>that came down and touched America</p>
<p>and said we&rsquo;re better than everybody else.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s nobody who says our values are better.</p>
<p>Or our economy&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only if we do that work and we embody those behaviors.</p>
<p>On the one hand, that&rsquo;s kind of disappointing,</p>
<p>and say, well, we&rsquo;ve had 200 plus years</p>
<p>of people working hard to create this great thing</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve inherited.</p>
<p>No, actually they got us into the room,</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s all up to us.</p>
<p>And so what I&rsquo;d say is, that&rsquo;s the opportunity.</p>
<p>The bad thing is we&rsquo;ve gotta understand, but it&rsquo;s up to us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what we do now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what we do going forward.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s in the rear view mirror</p>
<p>that I think is gonna make a difference.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s every reason in the world</p>
<p>that America can do very, very well.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>because we are entering into the equivalent</p>
<p>of a cold war competition, whether we want to or not,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just gonna come upon us.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re gonna have to not militarily only,</p>
<p>but as a society,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have to be a society that other people admire</p>
<p>because ultimately if they don&rsquo;t admire us as a society,</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t support us in the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Rohan] Awesome, thank you so much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you so much, General McChrystal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You have given us so much food for thought.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been inspiring.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been honest, you&rsquo;ve been empathetic.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been humble, really insightful.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very grateful to you for this opportunity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very grateful to our Veterans Club at Haas</p>
<p>for making this opportunity possible.</p>
<p>So thank you, and thank everyone in the room.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>(audience applauding)</p>
<ul>
<li>My pleasure.</li>

<p>Thank you.</p>
