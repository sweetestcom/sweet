    <p>Our card this week is Jennifer Lynn, the Queen of Hearts from California.</p>
<p>In 1994, the brutal murder of 14-year-old Jenny inside her parents&rsquo; safe suburban</p>
<p>house left a community shaken to its core, because not only had a bright and talented</p>
<p>life been suddenly snuffed out, but police struggled to find a motive.</p>
<p>And the more clues they uncovered, the more investigators realized the nightmare they</p>
<p>were dealing with.</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s murder was more than a crime of opportunity.</p>
<p>It had been carefully planned.</p>
<p>For nearly 30 years, Jenny&rsquo;s murder has weighed on Alameda County and terrorized detectives</p>
<p>as they pondered the same question over and over since 1994.</p>
<p>Why Jenny?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>It was about 5.30 p.m. on May 27, 1994.</p>
<p>John Lynn was at work at the Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco, and he knew that his</p>
<p>14-year-old daughter was home alone in their Castro Valley home 30-some minutes away, so</p>
<p>he called their house phone to check in on her.</p>
<p>The call rang, but then the answering machine picked up.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like Jenny to not answer the phone if she was home, but he figured she</p>
<p>was just busy around the house or maybe was outside playing with the family dog.</p>
<p>So John wrapped things up at work and started heading home just before 6.</p>
<p>He jumped on the train, as he did every day, and arrived at his station at around 6.30.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when he hopped in his car and was home by 6.45.</p>
<p>When he walked inside the house, he was probably expecting to be greeted by Jenny, but instead</p>
<p>there was just silence.</p>
<p>He called out for her, but there was no response, so John started walking around the first level</p>
<p>of the home, checking every room.</p>
<p>As he walked, he noticed the TV was on, and on the dining room table was an uneaten microwave</p>
<p>dinner, which meant that Jenny was definitely around somewhere.</p>
<p>John thought Jenny was probably outside in the backyard, again, maybe playing with her</p>
<p>dog or something, so he opened the unlocked sliding glass door, stepped outside, and sure</p>
<p>enough there was the dog, outside in the dog run, but there was no sign of Jenny.</p>
<p>And something that John found odd was the fact that the sliding glass door was unlocked</p>
<p>when he opened it, but Jenny wasn&rsquo;t out there.</p>
<p>He knew that his wife, Maylynn, always checked before leaving for work that all of the windows</p>
<p>were shut, all of the doors were locked, so this stuck out to him.</p>
<p>John went back inside to check the one place he hadn&rsquo;t yet, upstairs.</p>
<p>As he walked in his and Maylynn&rsquo;s primary bedroom, he noticed something was off.</p>
<p>The door to the ensuite bathroom was shut.</p>
<p>The door always stayed open unless it was being used, and Jenny had no reason to be</p>
<p>using that specific bathroom.</p>
<p>So with a lump in his throat, John slowly opened the door, and his worst fears were</p>
<p>confirmed.</p>
<p>Lying face down on the floor in a pool of blood was his daughter, Jenny.</p>
<p>She was nude, her arms and legs were bound with grey duct tape, and it looked like her</p>
<p>clothes had been cut off.</p>
<p>Heart racing, John dropped to the floor beside his daughter and rolled her over.</p>
<p>The front of her body was covered with puncture wounds.</p>
<p>It was clear to John right away that it was too late for any life-saving measures.</p>
<p>His beloved, youngest baby girl was dead.</p>
<p>Somewhat with shock and grief, he picked up the nearest phone and dialed 911.</p>
<p>And through tears and screams, he begged the operator to send help.</p>
<p>As first responders were on their way, John called Maylynn at work.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you get the words out, but John did.</p>
<p>I went a little bit blank.</p>
<p>All I thought of was, is this real?</p>
<p>Is this real?</p>
<p>And I ran.</p>
<p>I ran all the way from, I believe I was on the fourth floor or fifth floor of the building.</p>
<p>I ran downstairs, and I ran to my car, and I drove.</p>
<p>On the way back, all I could think of was, is this me?</p>
<p>I could never see her again.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so unreal at the time, that moment of, like, something irreversible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I thought of.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t see her again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That thought, it tear your heart.</p>
<p>When deputies with the Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office arrived, they first did a thorough</p>
<p>sweep of the house to clear it of any suspects, and medical personnel rushed in to check on Jenny.</p>
<p>But just as John had told the 911 operator, there was nothing that could be done.</p>
<p>And with the nature of how she was found, partially nude, bound with gray duct tape</p>
<p>and stabbed repeatedly, there was no doubt in anyone&rsquo;s mind that they were dealing</p>
<p>with a homicide, and probably the most brutal killing they had ever seen.</p>
<p>The bloody scene was a stark contrast in the Lynn&rsquo;s suburban upscale home.</p>
<p>Police wasted no time.</p>
<p>Right away, they called evidence technicians and more law enforcement to respond.</p>
<p>The Lynn&rsquo;s home, which hours earlier was a safe oasis for John, Mae Lynn, and their</p>
<p>two beautiful daughters, was now the biggest crime scene in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>When police started searching the Lynn&rsquo;s backyard, that&rsquo;s when they began to piece</p>
<p>together what had happened.</p>
<p>All over the deck, around the hot tub, and even in some patches of dirt, investigators</p>
<p>found footprints.</p>
<p>It looked like they were boot prints, maybe from a Gorilla brand work boot or something</p>
<p>similar.</p>
<p>Now, none of the prints were of a whole foot, though, so detectives weren&rsquo;t able to determine</p>
<p>an exact shoe size.</p>
<p>All they could tell after lifting them were that they were somewhere between a men&rsquo;s</p>
<p>size 9 and 11.</p>
<p>You can actually find pictures of the prints and other crime scene photos in the blog post</p>
<p>for this episode.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s on our website, thedeckpodcast.com.</p>
<p>Now, police also found evidence that the killer&rsquo;s first attempt to enter the home was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>On the sliding glass door on the upper balcony that went from the backyard up to an entrance</p>
<p>to the primary bedroom, investigators found small pry marks.</p>
<p>It looks like maybe a flat-tip object was used to try and unlock the door, something</p>
<p>like a flathead screwdriver, maybe?</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t work, and so detectives determined that after this entry method failed, the killer</p>
<p>went another route.</p>
<p>Downstairs, one of the dining room windows on the side of the house that was in the dog</p>
<p>run and looked toward the neighbor&rsquo;s house was smashed.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m sure probably a lot of you already know what a dog run is.</p>
<p>I actually didn&rsquo;t until I saw pictures of this, which again, we have on our website.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super helpful to see, but for those of you who can&rsquo;t access that right now, a dog</p>
<p>run is kind of like this little fenced-in area on the side of the house.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s within the yard, connected to the house, where you could basically let a dog out to</p>
<p>just get some fresh air, go to the bathroom, but they don&rsquo;t have free reign to just roam</p>
<p>the backyard.</p>
<p>But anyway, it wasn&rsquo;t just the fact that the window was broken.</p>
<p>The police, it looked like someone had shattered the window, then tried to cover it up, like</p>
<p>the interior curtain had been shifted from its usual position to cover up the window.</p>
<p>And again, we&rsquo;ve got pictures of this, but it&rsquo;s one of those where like it&rsquo;s connected</p>
<p>at the top and the bottom of the window with this like tie in the middle.</p>
<p>And that tie, again, normally sits right in the middle, but it was way down low, so they</p>
<p>could just tell that even though the curtain itself was technically in the same position,</p>
<p>someone had moved it or maneuvered it because that tie had kind of shifted all the way to</p>
<p>the bottom.</p>
<p>Aside from how the curtain was positioned, some of the glass shards also looked like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d been moved to disguise the fact that the window was broken.</p>
<p>So detectives suspected that that was how the killer made entry to the home.</p>
<p>Now the opening was rather small, but it was just big enough for an adult to squeeze through.</p>
<p>Now if you look at the pictures on the website, this is something I actually can&rsquo;t wrap my</p>
<p>head around.</p>
<p>Because when I say that the opening was small, it looks so small.</p>
<p>And the thing that I can&rsquo;t get over is there are even these shards of glass sticking up.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like, okay, say you punched a hole through the window, you&rsquo;ve got these</p>
<p>pokey glass pieces right on the bottom, like facing up, which I would have assumed someone</p>
<p>would either cut themselves on at a minimum as they were coming in if they&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>maneuver around the shards.</p>
<p>But really, I almost would have expected those bottom pieces to be like completely flattened</p>
<p>off as someone is like shuffling in and taking that with them.</p>
<p>And again, the curtain is like completely intact, which I would have imagined for a</p>
<p>full grown adult to not rip or damage as they were entering the home, like seems impossible.</p>
<p>But the detectives told us that they actually had someone recreate it, and they said it</p>
<p>was totally possible.</p>
<p>So the working theory was that the killer entered through the broken window before Jenny</p>
<p>had gotten home, then tried to cover up his mess so Jenny wouldn&rsquo;t be suspicious, and</p>
<p>then hid upstairs where he waited for her.</p>
<p>Then after killing Jenny, police think that the suspect went back downstairs, unlocked</p>
<p>the downstairs sliding glass door, and left that way.</p>
<p>As detectives combed through the rest of the house, there was something else that they</p>
<p>found very odd.</p>
<p>It appeared that nothing was taken from the home.</p>
<p>Nothing had been ransacked or gone through.</p>
<p>In reporting by the North County Times, Lieutenant Ted Nelson was quoted saying,</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t even signs of any intent to rob the home.</p>
<p>The whole thing appears very controlled.</p>
<p>While detectives and the crime scene technicians were scouring the property for clues, the</p>
<p>coroner&rsquo;s bureau was conducting Jenny&rsquo;s autopsy and administering a sexual assault</p>
<p>exam.</p>
<p>It surprised no one that the coroner concluded Jenny&rsquo;s cause of death was multiple stab</p>
<p>wounds, though back at the crime scene, they weren&rsquo;t finding any weapons that they believed</p>
<p>were used in the attack.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d imagine it caught everyone by surprise when the exam found no evidence of sexual</p>
<p>assault.</p>
<p>If neither theft nor sexual assault were the motive for killing a 14-year-old girl, then</p>
<p>what the hell was?</p>
<p>Police were stumped.</p>
<p>In the same reporting from the North County Times, Lieutenant Nelson said, quote,</p>
<p>It appears the motive was to kill her.</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s just a cute little sweetheart of a girl, just a nice kid.</p>
<p>Jenny was as talented as she was nice.</p>
<p>She was a straight-A student at Canyon Middle School, where she was set to graduate in less</p>
<p>than a month.</p>
<p>Her teacher said she was even likely to be named the class valedictorian.</p>
<p>Her dad, John, was so proud of her.</p>
<p>Jenny was a very lively teenager.</p>
<p>She was excellent in school, academic studies was excellent.</p>
<p>And she was also very good at playing music with piano, with viola.</p>
<p>And she is very friendly.</p>
<p>She loved making friends.</p>
<p>She is very well liked at school by students, by teachers, by everyone.</p>
<p>Aside from excelling at school, Jenny loved music.</p>
<p>And she loved being active.</p>
<p>She ran, danced, played tennis.</p>
<p>Part of Jenny&rsquo;s bio on the Jenny Lin Foundation reads, quote,</p>
<p>Jenny pursued many talents and interests.</p>
<p>She sought and welcomed new challenges voraciously and kept her family busy, driving her to her</p>
<p>many activities, end quote.</p>
<p>Even at the young age of 14, Jenny was already showing that she was a well-rounded person.</p>
<p>John and Mei-Lin told our reporting team that she was always blowing them away with her</p>
<p>wisdom and maturity.</p>
<p>Occasionally, if she was, you know, sad or upset or disappointed on the parental decision,</p>
<p>she would go up to her room and she&rsquo;d stay there.</p>
<p>She kind of like time out herself, you know, for five, 10 minutes.</p>
<p>And then she&rsquo;ll come downstairs and hug me and say, I understand, you know, Mama, I understand</p>
<p>why you did it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one thing that I would never forget.</p>
<p>While Jenny&rsquo;s family was mourning the loss of their bright, funny, kind-hearted young</p>
<p>daughter, police were looking high and low for the person who took her life.</p>
<p>Because Jenny&rsquo;s murder happened in broad daylight in an upper-middle-class suburban</p>
<p>neighborhood, one of those where houses are just inches apart, detectives were positive</p>
<p>that someone must have seen or heard something.</p>
<p>So the sheriff&rsquo;s office did a canvas of the neighborhood, going door to door, seeing if</p>
<p>neighbors witnessed anything strange in the afternoon or early evening of May 27th.</p>
<p>And just as investigators suspected, people did see some weird things.</p>
<p>And the tips police got were a bit all over the place.</p>
<p>One man who lived in the neighborhood said that he was driving home that day, maybe around</p>
<p>6 or 6.30.</p>
<p>And as he approached their neighborhood, he saw a man that he didn&rsquo;t recognize walking</p>
<p>away from the neighborhood.</p>
<p>He said that this guy was on foot cutting through a baseball field right behind the</p>
<p>Lynn&rsquo;s house and was carrying a blue duffel bag with red straps.</p>
<p>He recalled that the guy had something covering his head, maybe a hood or a hat, and he seemed</p>
<p>to be purposely avoiding eye contact with this driver.</p>
<p>Another resident of the neighborhood thought that they saw someone suspicious riding a</p>
<p>motorcycle in the area that afternoon.</p>
<p>Someone else recalled a man was going door to door trying to sell people something, and</p>
<p>a few people reported hearing a dog barking loudly at around 3 p.m.</p>
<p>But if we assume that that was the Lynn&rsquo;s dog barking at the intruder, that conflicts</p>
<p>with detectives timeline.</p>
<p>I mean, according to their theory, the killer was already inside the house well before Jenny</p>
<p>got home.</p>
<p>Jenny got home from school at like 2.45, and then the dogs heard at like 3, which to me</p>
<p>at least means that the barking dog probably wasn&rsquo;t related.</p>
<p>Or I mean, I guess the dog could have been barking when something was happening to Jenny.</p>
<p>If the dog heard her screaming, I don&rsquo;t know, but you would think someone else would have</p>
<p>heard her screaming.</p>
<p>Something about this just isn&rsquo;t lining up.</p>
<p>And I keep coming back to the dog.</p>
<p>So hear me out for a second.</p>
<p>Again, police think that this guy is in the house before Jenny comes home at 2.45.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t anyone hear a dog barking earlier in the day when police think the killer broke</p>
<p>in?</p>
<p>I had a long conversation about this with our reporter, and we did this over Zoom, and</p>
<p>literally when I got on Zoom, her dog lost it, seeing me on the computer.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not that abnormal.</p>
<p>Dogs will, you know, they might not attack, but they&rsquo;re going to make noise, especially</p>
<p>if they feel like the person that they love and are protecting is in danger.</p>
<p>Like someone is breaking into the Lynn&rsquo;s house for God&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>I think most family dogs would be freaking out, barking up a storm that a stranger had</p>
<p>entered the house.</p>
<p>And even though it&rsquo;s inside at this time, again, we&rsquo;re assuming Jenny hasn&rsquo;t let the</p>
<p>dog out into the dog run area.</p>
<p>Again, these houses are so close together.</p>
<p>You can see how close.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got pictures on our website.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t help but think, granted, I don&rsquo;t know what kind of dog it was.</p>
<p>The detective now doesn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But small dog, big dog, there&rsquo;s very few dogs that are just cool with a stranger coming</p>
<p>in, which makes me wonder if this dog was comfortable with whoever broke into their</p>
<p>home.</p>
<p>Whether that means it was a family friend or even a stranger who&rsquo;d been coming around</p>
<p>and getting the dog familiar with them while the Lynn&rsquo;s weren&rsquo;t looking.</p>
<p>And that idea gives me chills.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a theory, but it&rsquo;s something that I keep getting hung up on.</p>
<p>I cannot stop thinking about this dog and what it could mean.</p>
<p>But anyway, while officers were doing a canvas of the neighborhood, detectives were talking</p>
<p>to Jenny&rsquo;s friends and family to determine what she had been up to the day she was killed.</p>
<p>It was a Friday, the Friday before Memorial Day.</p>
<p>Jenny got out of school at around 2.20.</p>
<p>She took the bus home, as she did every day since her parents both worked full time.</p>
<p>Around 2.40, she was dropped off at the end of her street, which was about a block from</p>
<p>her house.</p>
<p>And that means that she was likely walking in the door at about 2.45.</p>
<p>Not long after getting home, Jenny called a friend just to chat.</p>
<p>The friend told police that the call probably lasted like an hour, and it was just a normal</p>
<p>conversation.</p>
<p>She was talking about school, things going on with her classmates, their big summer plans.</p>
<p>At one point during the call, Jenny sat down and started playing the piano.</p>
<p>She was a master pianist, and friends didn&rsquo;t seem to even think it was weird for Jenny</p>
<p>to be poking around with the piano during this casual call.</p>
<p>Now not long after that call, Jenny phoned another friend.</p>
<p>It was around 4.45 at this point, and that friend told police that she and Jenny chatted</p>
<p>for a few minutes, but then the call ended abruptly when the friend thought that her</p>
<p>parents got home.</p>
<p>A bit later, the friend called Jenny back, they chatted some more.</p>
<p>Jenny talked about her plans for that evening.</p>
<p>She said she was going to fix herself something to eat, then watch Mommy Dearest on TV.</p>
<p>Jenny didn&rsquo;t sound stressed or mention anything about a broken window or a weird feeling.</p>
<p>The two chatted until like 5.30 when Jenny said that she needed to hang up to get some</p>
<p>chores and homework done before her parents got home.</p>
<p>And that was the last time anyone spoke to Jenny.</p>
<p>Investigators questioned her family, too, partially to clear them of any suspicion and</p>
<p>partially to further flesh out their timeline.</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s older sister Rhoda, who was in college, couldn&rsquo;t provide much helpful information</p>
<p>to aid in the investigation.</p>
<p>She said that she was with her boyfriend in Santa Cruz that day about an hour away.</p>
<p>Rhoda and her boyfriend both agreed to take polygraphs, and they both passed.</p>
<p>Police talked to Jenny&rsquo;s mom, Mei-Lin, who confirmed that before leaving for work</p>
<p>that morning at around 7, she did her usual routine.</p>
<p>She checked that all the windows were shut, the doors were locked, and the stove was off.</p>
<p>Mei-Lin recalled that she tried to reach Jenny at around 4.30 that afternoon, but the call</p>
<p>went to the answering machine.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t try to reach Jenny again, and she went back to work until she received that</p>
<p>horrible phone call from John.</p>
<p>Police also asked Mei-Lin to take a polygraph, and she, too, passed.</p>
<p>Investigators then talked with John.</p>
<p>He said that he and Jenny left the house that morning not long after Mei-Lin, probably around</p>
<p>7.35.</p>
<p>He dropped Jenny off at school at around 7.50, watched her walk into the building, and then</p>
<p>he drove to the nearby Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART, station.</p>
<p>As he always did, he took the BART train to San Francisco, where he worked.</p>
<p>Nothing significant happened until John got home and discovered his daughter.</p>
<p>And just like the rest of his family, John agreed to take a polygraph, and he, too, passed.</p>
<p>Now John&rsquo;s story about the day didn&rsquo;t raise any red flags for police, especially with</p>
<p>the support of a passed polygraph.</p>
<p>But something else he said during the interview really raised some eyebrows.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something Detective Patrick Smith with the Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>working on Jenny&rsquo;s case today, still comes back to sometimes.</p>
<p>A couple weeks or a week before the murder, there was something strange that occurred</p>
<p>to John Lin.</p>
<p>John said that around 7 p.m. on May 12th, 15 days before Jenny was killed, he was exiting</p>
<p>the BART station on his way home from work, heading to his car parked just outside, when</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s suddenly confronted by a man that he didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>He described this guy as having a dark complexion, maybe around 5'8, 5'10, 35 to 40 years old.</p>
<p>And what this man said to John was deeply disturbing.</p>
<p>The man told John that he had his daughter, like he had kidnapped her and was holding</p>
<p>on to her.</p>
<p>Obviously, this freaked John out.</p>
<p>He immediately got away from the man and hopped in his car.</p>
<p>Before John could get the chance to drive away, the man stood right beside the car and,</p>
<p>like, motioned for John to roll his window down.</p>
<p>John did his best to ignore the guy and drive away as fast as he could, but as John was</p>
<p>driving away, he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel like he should have gotten a better look at</p>
<p>the guy.</p>
<p>So he actually turned around and drove back.</p>
<p>John looked around for a bit, but he couldn&rsquo;t find this guy anywhere.</p>
<p>Now, John told police that at the time, he didn&rsquo;t take the man&rsquo;s threat too seriously,</p>
<p>but it spooked him enough that he went to Jenny&rsquo;s practice where he knew she was supposed</p>
<p>to be just to make sure that she was safe and sound, and she was.</p>
<p>So knowing Jenny was accounted for, he then phoned his other daughter, Rhoda, who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>off at college, and just like Jenny, she was perfectly fine.</p>
<p>So John tried to brush the whole interaction off.</p>
<p>He thought that perhaps the man was struggling with potentially mental illness.</p>
<p>But it was something that stuck with him.</p>
<p>Because John told our reporting team that in all his years taking public transportation</p>
<p>to and from work, nothing like this had ever happened to him before or since.</p>
<p>The interaction also stood out to police, and they arranged for John to work with a</p>
<p>sketch artist right away.</p>
<p>They wanted a composite of this guy ASAP.</p>
<p>John didn&rsquo;t know how much he could actually remember, but he was willing to give it a</p>
<p>shot.</p>
<p>On June 3rd, a week after Jenny was killed, John met with the sketch artist, and the first</p>
<p>composite of this mystery man was created.</p>
<p>Though John wasn&rsquo;t super happy with the finished product.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t think that it resembled the man he saw.</p>
<p>So the Lins actually hired their own sketch artist to create a different sketch.</p>
<p>You can see both of those on our website.</p>
<p>Police didn&rsquo;t distribute that first sketch, because the sketch artist thought John lacked</p>
<p>the recall to accurately describe the man he saw.</p>
<p>But after the Lins had that second one made, the family themselves actually distributed</p>
<p>that to the local media.</p>
<p>Detective Smith said a few tips came from that, but nothing that panned out.</p>
<p>To this day, police don&rsquo;t know who that man was.</p>
<p>In fact, investigators today aren&rsquo;t so sure the confrontation was related to Jenny&rsquo;s</p>
<p>murder at all.</p>
<p>Detective Smith&rsquo;s gut says that it was likely just a coincidence.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know, man.</p>
<p>This has kept me up at night.</p>
<p>I spiral on this.</p>
<p>Part of me thinks it&rsquo;s too weird, too much of a coincidence.</p>
<p>But then I swing the other way and say, but what was the point?</p>
<p>If the guy who approached him was the same man who would later kill his daughter, what</p>
<p>did he gain by telling John he&rsquo;d kidnapped his daughter when he hadn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>I could spend the next 45 minutes talking about this alone, because I have a hundred</p>
<p>theories.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re theories.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all suspicion.</p>
<p>None of it solid.</p>
<p>But listen, even though it seemed like a coincidence to them, for a while, that was all they had</p>
<p>to go on.</p>
<p>Authorities in Alameda County quickly figured out that Jenny&rsquo;s case was going to be a</p>
<p>tough one to crack, and they knew they could benefit from some assistance.</p>
<p>So they asked the FBI to step in and help using their resources and expertise.</p>
<p>Specifically, local law enforcement asked the FBI to take a look at the duct tape used</p>
<p>to bind Jenny&rsquo;s limbs.</p>
<p>And get this, the FBI lab was not only able to determine the exact brand of tape, but</p>
<p>they also matched up the torn ends and were able to determine the sequence of how she</p>
<p>was bound.</p>
<p>Police also consulted with the FBI&rsquo;s behavioral analysis unit and came up with a profile of</p>
<p>the killer, one that police could pass out to the Lynn&rsquo;s neighbors to see if it might</p>
<p>jog someone&rsquo;s memory.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a voice actor reading the profile.</p>
<p>We believe that the person or persons who was responsible for Jennifer&rsquo;s death may</p>
<p>be familiar with this neighborhood.</p>
<p>He could have lived, worked, or visited the neighborhood sometime around or before May</p>
<p>27th.</p>
<p>Because the offender may have been around here for purely legitimate reasons, he may</p>
<p>not have stood out in your mind.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that the person responsible for Jennifer&rsquo;s death would not necessarily</p>
<p>appear strange, threatening, or weird if you would have had some type of interaction with</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>We believe the offender is a loner who may live with others and interact with others,</p>
<p>but he prefers his own company.</p>
<p>He has reasonably good interpersonal skills, is comfortable in the neighborhood, would</p>
<p>not necessarily stand out for any reason, and following the murder would have indicated</p>
<p>concern or worry over what happened to Jennifer.</p>
<p>It is likely that the person has a problem with alcohol, but would not normally appear</p>
<p>drunk or out of control.</p>
<p>It is possible he left for a day, perhaps longer, for what would appear to be legitimate</p>
<p>reasons.</p>
<p>However, if he still has ties to this area, he would have returned.</p>
<p>This part about her killer knowing the neighborhood, I personally think, is really important.</p>
<p>We have some aerial footage of the neighborhood on our website, and it wasn&rsquo;t what I was</p>
<p>picturing at all.</p>
<p>It is like out there on its own in the middle of the California hills.</p>
<p>This is not a place that someone just passes through without having a reason to be there.</p>
<p>Now, even with all of these incredible resources at detectives&rsquo; fingertips, there was a weeks-long</p>
<p>lull in the investigation.</p>
<p>Sure, police were getting tips and following leads, but nothing was materializing.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have any suspects.</p>
<p>Melanie&rsquo;s name stayed in the headlines, though.</p>
<p>In July, John and Mei-Lin were interviewed for a piece in the Oakland Tribune by William</p>
<p>Wong.</p>
<p>In the column, Wong described John and Mei-Lin&rsquo;s journey moving from Taiwan to the United States</p>
<p>in 1973 to pursue graduate degrees.</p>
<p>After getting married in 74, they decided to stay in the U.S. because they thought it</p>
<p>would be a better place to raise their children.</p>
<p>They settled in California because of its pleasant climate, and they ultimately chose</p>
<p>the affluent Palomares Hills housing development because of how safe it felt.</p>
<p>It was a new community.</p>
<p>It was a pretty upscale community.</p>
<p>Usually people have good jobs, are working diligently, really like to have a good environment</p>
<p>to bring up their family.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of environment we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>We thought it couldn&rsquo;t be safer than any other place, who knows that things like this</p>
<p>could happen.</p>
<p>The Lin&rsquo;s illusion of safety was crushed on May 27, 1994.</p>
<p>In his piece, Wong wrote, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Just like that, without any rational explanation, without any warning, the Lin&rsquo;s American dream</p>
<p>was shattered.</p>
<p>It will never be the same for a family that, until that awful moment, had every reason</p>
<p>to celebrate their close-knit, comfortable, middle-class existence,&rdquo; end quote.</p>
<p>Although Jenny&rsquo;s case was still getting the media attention it deserved, police still</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have any solid leads.</p>
<p>That is, until August 3rd, just over two months after Jenny was murdered, when investigators&rsquo;</p>
<p>first promising suspect came on their radar, a 22-year-old Castro Valley resident who police</p>
<p>asked us to call Doug.</p>
<p>Doug shared a home with his parents in the same neighborhood as the Lin&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s not clear who tipped police off about Doug or what they found suspicious about</p>
<p>him, but the more detectives learned about this guy, the more their suspicion grew.</p>
<p>They learned that Doug&rsquo;s father owned a surgical instruments sharpening business, which I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know was a thing, but to police, it meant that he would have had access to sharp tools</p>
<p>if he wanted to commit a murder.</p>
<p>So again, they didn&rsquo;t have a murder weapon at the scene, and as far as I can tell, never</p>
<p>even determined with 100% certainty what she was stabbed with.</p>
<p>Detectives reached out to Doug&rsquo;s parents to see if they could provide an account of where</p>
<p>he was on May 27th, but they said they couldn&rsquo;t be of much help.</p>
<p>That was the start of Memorial Day weekend, remember, and they were out of town.</p>
<p>Now I say they, but they did not include Doug, who stayed behind.</p>
<p>So investigators went straight to their new person of interest, Doug, and they asked him</p>
<p>what he was doing up to and on the day of Jenny&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>He said that he was home all day until he picked up his girlfriend from work.</p>
<p>After that, he and his girlfriend went back to his house and hung out.</p>
<p>In fact, he said that&rsquo;s all they did the entire weekend.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t leave the house really at all.</p>
<p>He told detectives that he didn&rsquo;t even know Jenny and he didn&rsquo;t hear about her murder</p>
<p>until a few days later.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing, when police talked to Doug&rsquo;s girlfriend, they found out that</p>
<p>her shift on May 27th didn&rsquo;t end until 8 p.m., more than an hour after Jenny&rsquo;s body was found.</p>
<p>Police also learned that not long after Jenny&rsquo;s murder, Doug moved out of his parents&rsquo; home</p>
<p>and in with a friend, but a few weeks later moved back in with his parents.</p>
<p>Ring a bell?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly in line with what the FBI profilers said would happen.</p>
<p>So investigators kept their eye on Doug, but they didn&rsquo;t have any solid evidence or</p>
<p>enough probable cause to make an arrest.</p>
<p>So they took time to pursue other leads that came along, like one in August of 94, when</p>
<p>detectives in Alameda County got a call from another agency letting them know about a suspicious</p>
<p>guy who&rsquo;d just come on their radar, who they might want to look into for Jenny&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>Six hundred-some miles north, in Portland, Oregon, police found a man sleeping in a car</p>
<p>that had been stolen from San Ramon, California.</p>
<p>And what they found inside was disturbing.</p>
<p>Things like a round weight, books on topics ranging from satanic culture to body chemistry</p>
<p>to first aid, pornographic material, two blue ski masks, plastic flex cuffs, handcuffs,</p>
<p>a knife, a claw hammer, binoculars, combat boots, a blue bag, and gray duct tape.</p>
<p>The man who&rsquo;d been sleeping in the stolen car was 26-year-old Oregon resident Sebastian</p>
<p>Alexander Shaw.</p>
<p>Police took him into custody and called authorities in San Ramon to let them know about the stolen</p>
<p>car.</p>
<p>And when a detective in San Ramon heard about the Sebastian guy and the contents of his</p>
<p>car, his mind immediately went to Jenny Lin.</p>
<p>He thought there might be a connection, so he&rsquo;s the one that called Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Office right away.</p>
<p>The Sheriff&rsquo;s Office agreed that this Sebastian guy seemed like a promising suspect, especially</p>
<p>considering what was found in his car.</p>
<p>So they got a hold of the duct tape that was found and sent it to the FBI&rsquo;s lab to compare</p>
<p>it to the tape used on Jenny.</p>
<p>While the FBI was analyzing the tape, Alameda County detectives were looking hard at Sebastian,</p>
<p>trying to figure out if he had any connection to California.</p>
<p>And sure enough, they found out that he worked in Southern California from April to at least</p>
<p>May of 1994.</p>
<p>And since Jenny was killed in May, they could reasonably prove that Sebastian was in California</p>
<p>when Jenny was killed.</p>
<p>But just as police were getting their hopes up that they&rsquo;d caught the killer, the FBI</p>
<p>analysis results came back.</p>
<p>The duct tape found in the stolen car did not match the tape used to bind Jenny.</p>
<p>So as suspicious as Sebastian seemed, police had nothing on him aside from the fact that</p>
<p>he was in California when Jenny was killed.</p>
<p>So they were right back to square one.</p>
<p>Investigators couldn&rsquo;t shake the feeling that the answers they were looking for were</p>
<p>in the Lin&rsquo;s neighborhood.</p>
<p>So in September, police organized a thorough canvas of the area.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d already done a traditional door knocking canvas, but this one involved a detailed written</p>
<p>questionnaire that the FBI put together for police to deliver to every house within the</p>
<p>Lin&rsquo;s neighborhood.</p>
<p>And it included all kinds of questions.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of Jennifer Lin?</p>
<p>Have you heard about what happened to Jennifer?</p>
<p>Were you in the neighborhood on May 27th, 1994?</p>
<p>Who all lives in your house?</p>
<p>Who was at your home that day?</p>
<p>Who else did you see in the neighborhood at the time?</p>
<p>Did you have any repairmen or other maintenance type house calls on May 27th?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your opinion as to the type of person who could be responsible for Jenny&rsquo;s murder?</p>
<p>And boy, oh boy, did the questionnaire pay off.</p>
<p>It resulted in a major tip for police.</p>
<p>Apparently, at least one neighbor did see something suspicious on the day that Jenny</p>
<p>was murdered, but for some reason decided to keep the information from law enforcement.</p>
<p>In part two of this episode, which you can listen to right now, I&rsquo;ll tell you everything</p>
<p>we know about what that neighbor saw and the investigative avenues police took to keep</p>
<p>trying to find Jenny&rsquo;s killer.</p>
<p>We split this episode into two parts because the rest of this investigation is long and</p>
<p>complicated with so many twists and turns.</p>
<p>So please go listen to part two of Jenny&rsquo;s story right now, because it is far from over.</p>
<p>Until then, if you have any information about the murder of Jennifer Lynn on May 27th, 1994,</p>
<p>please contact the Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office at 510-667-3636.</p>
