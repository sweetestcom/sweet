    <p>Well, I would like to welcome everybody to I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast.</p>
<p>And today is a very special Thursday where we get to hear from our listeners.</p>
<p>Which is always the most fun.</p>
<p>Because there is so much shit out there that Pumps and I have just forgotten about.</p>
<p>And it is such a service to us to remind us what else we need to be annoyed with.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And that we&rsquo;re our people.</p>
<p>We found our people.</p>
<p>That we have a tribe.</p>
<p>We have a tribe.</p>
<p>And they are our tribe.</p>
<p>And together we browbeat this shit.</p>
<p>And then we feel better.</p>
<p>And when we feel better, we&rsquo;re nicer.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So these are very important therapeutic sessions that I think people should be able to get</p>
<p>off work for in order to listen to.</p>
<p>Like have a holiday.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast holiday.</p>
<p>Every Tuesday and Thursday.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to go to work till noon.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>They just have to listen to the podcast before noon.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Kylie, who was our first contestant today?</p>
<p>Our first one is Christine W.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Had It with dumbass, over the top, completely unqualified wedding registries where the couple</p>
<p>asks for contributions to their honeymoon fund and contributions to their airline ticket</p>
<p>and contributions to their house fund.</p>
<p>And then a bunch of dumbass, specific, unnecessary things that they&rsquo;re never going to fucking</p>
<p>use like a $5,000 wood fired pizza oven or a two person sleeping bag where they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>on a hikes like a bunch of cavemen.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I have just, I fucking had it and I&rsquo;m not going to buy you a wedding gift if you have</p>
<p>all those things.</p>
<p>You know what I like about that?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s had it and it&rsquo;s followed up with a boundary and an action.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I mean, that is, that is what we need to start doing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we, boundaries, you know, they&rsquo;re not my best suit.</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re the worst at that.</p>
<p>I could get better.</p>
<p>I do think back in the day, the wedding registry was like China that nobody ever fucking uses,</p>
<p>but we all had to register for it.</p>
<p>I have cabinets full of that shit and my kids were like, you need to sell this on like Craigslist</p>
<p>or whatever.</p>
<p>And I was like, it&rsquo;s your problem.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s in this cabinet.</p>
<p>When I die, you fuck with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m done with it.</p>
<p>Never used half of it.</p>
<p>But let me, let me ask you about that.</p>
<p>Like your kids don&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I mean, at that time it&rsquo;s probably pretty dated, right?</p>
<p>This is something that kind of cracks me up.</p>
<p>How people will be like with plates.</p>
<p>Those were my mother&rsquo;s plates or those are my grandmother&rsquo;s plates, but neither the mother</p>
<p>nor the grandmother ever fucking used them.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And what it is is a burden passed me down.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s my kids&rsquo; problems.</p>
<p>Let them figure it out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re burdening them with that.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you, they already have already said they don&rsquo;t want them.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you just get rid of them?</p>
<p>I told if they wanted to get rid of them on Craigslist right now, they could.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m just like, whatever you want to do with it, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Free up my shelves.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>So have you ever served on your china?</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I have, I have, my grandmother gave me, passed down this, uh, old Christmas china.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>Really nice.</p>
<p>Blah, blah.</p>
<p>And every year my mom and I are like, okay, we&rsquo;re going to get that out.</p>
<p>We are going to use that.</p>
<p>Going to do it.</p>
<p>The whole thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d have to hand wash it and everything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what happens.</p>
<p>By two days before we&rsquo;re like, let&rsquo;s just do paper plates.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just easier.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t even think I&rsquo;ve used that Christmas china that my grandmother gave me.</p>
<p>Not one time.</p>
<p>Not one time.</p>
<p>What do you think about this trend that Christine&rsquo;s talking about where the gifts are now.</p>
<p>Money.</p>
<p>Which I&rsquo;m kind of for, I would rather give like whatever your budget is for the gift.</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s say that you&rsquo;re planning on spending 150 bucks for the bride and groom or a hundred</p>
<p>bucks.</p>
<p>Then you could put that in.</p>
<p>But I do think it&rsquo;s obnoxious to start specifying like all of the things, like it&rsquo;s our honeymoon</p>
<p>fund or, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>How do you feel about that?</p>
<p>You know, my initial thought is it&rsquo;s in poor taste, right?</p>
<p>But then when you think about it, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Using the money or the gift that you give, they&rsquo;re actually using it for a good purpose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to just be a Waterford crystal that sits in the cabinet, but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s just my age.</p>
<p>Like contribute to our honeymoon, contribute to our airline.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m iffy.</p>
<p>I agree with her about the obnoxious, like $5,000 pizza oven.</p>
<p>I think that is ridiculous, way over the top.</p>
<p>But I am kind of, I&rsquo;m kind of like over the China thing.</p>
<p>I never used mine.</p>
<p>Never?</p>
<p>I have all this gorgeous Versace China that I maybe used five times when I had gay friends</p>
<p>over because I knew they would love it.</p>
<p>And like, because I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen your Versace.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fabulous.</p>
<p>I mean, it is absolutely 10 out of 10 fabulous.</p>
<p>And I would have a couple of gay couples over and have a fabulous dinner party.</p>
<p>But now I&rsquo;m like, okay, it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>My boys are not going to want it.</p>
<p>Heavens no, they&rsquo;re not going to want it.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I kind of, here&rsquo;s the deal, Christine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with half of your had it, but I kind of think the contribution, just a cash</p>
<p>deal and then let the people, let them figure out.</p>
<p>If they want to go blow it on their honeymoon, blow it, whatever it is.</p>
<p>But I think some of those, and I know so many people that have gotten married that they</p>
<p>have so many loads and loads and loads of gifts.</p>
<p>A lot of them never even come out of the box.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>And then you re-gift them.</p>
<p>I did that for years.</p>
<p>You re-gifted your wedding gifts?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That is ballsy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I didn&rsquo;t do it to the same, I was very good about if I&rsquo;m going to a wedding</p>
<p>shower for a person, it&rsquo;s not in the friend group of the person that gave me the gift.</p>
<p>So you were kind of diabolical about it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I would sit there.</p>
<p>How it all started, it wasn&rsquo;t like diabolical.</p>
<p>It was, oh my God, I have to be there in an hour.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a gift.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;ve got a whole room full of gifts.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what started it.</p>
<p>Then I became diabolical, but I kind of just fell into the re-gifting.</p>
<p>And then it became kind of an addiction.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it was an addiction.</p>
<p>It was just so convenient.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>How many gifts do you think you re-gifted?</p>
<p>Oh gosh, during the time when I was getting married and everybody else I knew getting</p>
<p>married, I mean, I would say at least 10.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No wonder.</p>
<p>You know, because you get all that serving pieces that are like-</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>So stuff that&rsquo;s generic.</p>
<p>I get that.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s really ballsy.</p>
<p>And I think it was kind of a sign that maybe your marriage might end poorly.</p>
<p>Well, considering every time you and I drive by the church that I got married in, you say,</p>
<p>where is the crime scene tape?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Every time we pass it, she points it out and goes, where&rsquo;s the crime scene tape?</p>
<p>I do every single time.</p>
<p>So there were a lot of signs before that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was a listener when you got to the aisle and you looked at 500 people deep.</p>
<p>500 people deep, had an enormous amount of bridesmaids, which Jennifer loves to beat</p>
<p>me up about.</p>
<p>And I remember I took the first step and through my head, I&rsquo;m thinking, this could go either</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>And it went that way.</p>
<p>This could go either way.</p>
<p>This could go either way as I&rsquo;m marching down.</p>
<p>Kylie, who is our next contestant?</p>
<p>Up next, we&rsquo;ve got Dana L.</p>
<p>Dana L.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where this podcast has been all my life.</p>
<p>But since I discovered it, I have been binge listening to the I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast 24-7</p>
<p>for the past at least three days.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had it with my bladder.</p>
<p>I have laughed and laughed and laughed.</p>
<p>And every time I laugh, I pee a little bit.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m 50, that means I have to change my underwear at least two or three times a</p>
<p>day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with my bladder.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>I need a bladder tuck, y&rsquo;all.</p>
<p>Dana, first of all, that was fantastic.</p>
<p>And thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thank you, Dana.</p>
<p>For binge listening.</p>
<p>Love that.</p>
<p>And pissing your pants for the I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast.</p>
<p>That is so good.</p>
<p>And we hope that we can keep, we hope that you can continue pissing your pants.</p>
<p>Maybe we should contribute, maybe we should make I&rsquo;ve Had It panties.</p>
<p>Panty liners.</p>
<p>Some Depends.</p>
<p>Some Depends.</p>
<p>No, let&rsquo;s do liners.</p>
<p>Liners.</p>
<p>No Depends.</p>
<p>Well, I will tell you that when you do get a certain age, like after having children,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m walking and I have to sneeze, I have to stop.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I used to be able to walk and sneeze at the same time.</p>
<p>Now I have to stop, kegel, then sneeze.</p>
<p>So I won&rsquo;t pee a little bit.</p>
<p>See, this is one of the advantages of a C-section.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, like, I don&rsquo;t sneeze or cough or anything.</p>
<p>Pee doesn&rsquo;t come out.</p>
<p>So are you saying you just have this fucking high and tight vagina?</p>
<p>Well, heavens no.</p>
<p>I would never say that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying.</p>
<p>I think Pumps is saying.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying, like, I never have, so many of my friends have that problem, but I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never had it because I was a C-section girl.</p>
<p>Look at Pumps, listener.</p>
<p>Look at Pumps with the high and tight vagina.</p>
<p>I mean, Pumps&rsquo; vagina is high.</p>
<p>And tight.</p>
<p>And tight, listener.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a safe.</p>
<p>Dana, I am so sorry.</p>
<p>I can, I, I care what you&rsquo;re saying because sometimes my bladder fills me during a sneeze</p>
<p>or maybe a hard giggle.</p>
<p>So I can relate with you.</p>
<p>Pumps finds this entirely unrelatable because her vagine is so high and so tight.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re putting words in my mouth, but that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I think that you said, I don&rsquo;t, you know, like, I don&rsquo;t have this problem.</p>
<p>I have other bladder related problems.</p>
<p>What are those?</p>
<p>Oh, that you have to pee nonstop for all the goddamn iced tea and drink?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>When I have to pee, it sometimes takes me a while.</p>
<p>Oh my God, listener.</p>
<p>Like when I sit down, it takes a while.</p>
<p>This is torture.</p>
<p>So Pumps and I are so, well, let me just say it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so fucked up that when she comes to the office to see me, she&rsquo;d be like, I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got to pee, come with me.</p>
<p>So I just go with her.</p>
<p>And so she sits down on the toilet and I mean, it is like, at first I&rsquo;m thinking, is it stage</p>
<p>fright?</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve been friends for over 20 years and then she&rsquo;s like, like squinting and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>focusing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then finally a little trail starts in and then it stops.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what happened?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, hang on.</p>
<p>I got to focus.</p>
<p>I got to focus.</p>
<p>So she wants me to go to the bathroom with her because she wants to talk to me.</p>
<p>But now I, you know what?</p>
<p>Your vagina is so goddamn high and tight.</p>
<p>That piss isn&rsquo;t coming out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>This is high and tight vagine problems.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to make it a hashtag, hashtag Daffy Pumps, hashtag pumps has a high and tight</p>
<p>vagine.</p>
<p>This is the worst thing.</p>
<p>I mean, this is unbelievable.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, I remember the house that I lived in before this and pumps has like, like uncontrollable</p>
<p>toddler like bowel situations that come on.</p>
<p>And I mean, it&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just sitting in my living room.</p>
<p>My housekeeper was at the house cleaning my master bathroom and I have like, I have a</p>
<p>baby and a toddler at the time.</p>
<p>I hear pumps come barreling in the house and I&rsquo;m like, oh my God, hi pumps.</p>
<p>And she goes and plops down on the toilet.</p>
<p>My poor housekeeper&rsquo;s in there and it is a Nagasaki Hiroshima style explosion.</p>
<p>It comes barreling out of the bathroom and I was like, what the fuck are you doing?</p>
<p>I know that was bad, but I was, it was a nine one one.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was bad.</p>
<p>But poor Berta.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know it was bad, but we, yes.</p>
<p>And we do.</p>
<p>We go to the bathroom a lot together.</p>
<p>We pee together.</p>
<p>I think a lot of friends pee together.</p>
<p>Would you pee with your girlfriends?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My actual girlfriend.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like very codependent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll sit on her lap while she&rsquo;s peeing.</p>
<p>I can totally see lesbians peeing together, but pumps and I are non-practicing lesbians.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, the only thing that&rsquo;s not lesbian about our relationship is that we don&rsquo;t sexually</p>
<p>act upon it.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Other than that, we&rsquo;re total lesbians.</p>
<p>Yet.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Yet.</p>
<p>Kylie keeps telling me there&rsquo;s time for me still.</p>
<p>There is time for you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in your prime.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Still high and tight.</p>
<p>I think that high and tight vagine could be really marketable on the post 50 lesbian market.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll hit it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>Kylie?</p>
<p>Up next and on theme is Derek B.</p>
<p>I have fucking had it with automated everything in public bathrooms, the fucking sinks, the</p>
<p>fucking soap, the fucking hand dryers.</p>
<p>Even if you want paper towels, they&rsquo;re fucking automated and I have to put my hands in and</p>
<p>out 15 times like I&rsquo;m fisting somebody in order to get the fucking water out of the</p>
<p>sink to wash my goddamn hands.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve fucking had it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not wrong.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not wrong.</p>
<p>I mean, where&rsquo;s the lie?</p>
<p>There is none.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>That shit doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Half the time it does not work.</p>
<p>So at this particular place that I go to every single day to engage in a sport, the bathrooms</p>
<p>have these, you can roll your eyes all you want to, but I&rsquo;m not going to say it today</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want, I don&rsquo;t want the fucking, you know, backlash from you and Kylie and</p>
<p>Richard.</p>
<p>So anyway, the toilets are supposed to be automated flushers and they don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Every time I go in to pee before I partake in this sporting activity, I look at the toilet.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all full.</p>
<p>And so then I have to put my foot up because I don&rsquo;t like to touch things.</p>
<p>So the touch thing works great, but he&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>I mean, the touch thing doesn&rsquo;t work great, but the idea is good because you don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>germs, but it&rsquo;s better just get the toilet paper and then flush the toilet with that</p>
<p>in your hand.</p>
<p>I also find that when you&rsquo;re trying to wash your hands, like you have to do 47 dances</p>
<p>to figure out where the motion sensor is.</p>
<p>You can never just like put your hands under there and the water comes out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, where is it?</p>
<p>Is it this way?</p>
<p>Is it that way?</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;ll spurt and it&rsquo;ll stop.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I&rsquo;m a big, I don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the automated.</p>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>The soap, usually it&rsquo;s, you know, doesn&rsquo;t shoot out where it&rsquo;s supposed to.</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Paper towels are a disaster.</p>
<p>Disaster.</p>
<p>Disaster.</p>
<p>I think Derek is a hundred percent right.</p>
<p>I think in general, public restrooms need to up their game.</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;re a business and you have a public restroom, that shit needs to be really</p>
<p>well maintained.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>I just, I think they need every, a lot of the places I go to, I think they need to maintain</p>
<p>their public restroom integrity better.</p>
<p>Soaps need to be refilled.</p>
<p>Toilets need to be cleaned.</p>
<p>Off the ground, paper towels refilled.</p>
<p>And I just don&rsquo;t think, I don&rsquo;t think this is being addressed enough.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s being ignored.</p>
<p>The worst part of it though, is the nasty public toilet paper, like the feel, the toilet</p>
<p>paper in the public bathrooms.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s like sandpaper.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I bet that really hurts on your high and tight vaginal vagene.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s never squeezed a baby out of it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think that would probably hurt more?</p>
<p>Kelly, you&rsquo;ve never had a vaginal baby yet.</p>
<p>So does that public restroom toilet paper hurt your vagene?</p>
<p>It does hurt.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how bad it hurts you.</p>
<p>You know, it doesn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>Is it untight and un-high?</p>
<p>Low and loose.</p>
<p>Quasi-high, quasi-tight.</p>
<p>I mean, I have to do some kegels, you know, to keep it.</p>
<p>Do you have to do any kegels?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What about you, Kylie?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>But you do?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I feel like just subconsciously sometimes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing some right now.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Now I am too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to bust out an eight count.</p>
<p>I wonder if the mic will pick it up.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s kegeling?</p>
<p>Oh, audience.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s all do kegels together.</p>
<p>Five, six, seven, eight.</p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But I will say, Derek, I agree with you.</p>
<p>Public restrooms are going to the shitter.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No pun intended.</p>
<p>Or.</p>
<p>Or pun intended.</p>
<p>Pun intended.</p>
<p>Or pun intended.</p>
<p>Or pun intended.</p>
<p>Or pun intended.</p>
<p>Or pun intended.</p>
<p>Or pun intended.</p>
<p>Or pun intended.</p>
<p>Or pun intended.</p>
<p>Or pun intended.</p>
<p>Or pun intended.</p>
<p>Or pun intended.</p>
<p>Or pun intended.</p>
<p>Or pun intended.</p>
<p>Or pun intended.</p>
<p>Either way.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so clever.</p>
<p>God damn it.</p>
<p>Tune in to I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast for the cleverest cunts around.</p>
<p>Okay, Kylie, who was our last and final contestant?</p>
<p>The last one is Juliana C.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with people not honoring my exit.</p>
<p>What is attempted to be a graceful exit, you know, the good old, well, I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>keep you.</p>
<p>It looks like it&rsquo;s getting late.</p>
<p>I gotta get some sleep.</p>
<p>That is far from an invitation to start a therapy session with me to talk about your</p>
<p>dumb ass adult children, to talk about your struggles at work.</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>You let me leave.</p>
<p>You release me from this captivity.</p>
<p>I am not signing up for a church goodbye right now.</p>
<p>You are asking me to either throat punch you or Kool-Aid man my ass through the door.</p>
<p>Please honor my exit.</p>
<p>Release me.</p>
<p>That is fantastic.</p>
<p>Juliana, this is so on brand, so perfect.</p>
<p>I have this problem when I will tell people on the phone, okay, I&rsquo;m going to let you go.</p>
<p>And then they start gearing up and it&rsquo;s so rude.</p>
<p>You know who does it to me a lot?</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Josh.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t surprise me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not done until he&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just unbelievable.</p>
<p>And then I have a couple of other friends I&rsquo;m talking to on the phone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best thing about you and me.</p>
<p>We hang up on each other.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We could be in the middle of a huge conversation and then it&rsquo;s just like, okay, bye.</p>
<p>Oh, immediately.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll call each other.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s never any follow-up or, did you get mad at me, did I hurt your feelings?</p>
<p>But Juliana&rsquo;s onto something and this is that person is not reading her social cues.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>She says she&rsquo;s tired.</p>
<p>She says she needs to get home.</p>
<p>And all of that is getting ignored.</p>
<p>What I wonder about is why don&rsquo;t the people want her to leave?</p>
<p>You know, if it&rsquo;s getting late and why would they want to keep her there?</p>
<p>Based on the content that she just gave us, I imagine she&rsquo;s our kind of people and that</p>
<p>we want to be around her.</p>
<p>Based on these people that aren&rsquo;t releasing her, they probably want some of what Juliana&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got.</p>
<p>And so then the divide, you know, it just gets greater and greater.</p>
<p>And the more they want it, the less you want to give it.</p>
<p>I think these needy people are heat-seeking missiles to people like us and our listeners.</p>
<p>They seek us out.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s torture or they want to convert, but it&rsquo;s a problem where people</p>
<p>cannot read a social cue that you are about to leave.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten pretty bad about it.</p>
<p>Like Josh and I will go out and walk the dogs and he&rsquo;ll start, we see some people we know,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, hey, how are you?</p>
<p>And I just think we&rsquo;re going to keep on walking, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even a stop.</p>
<p>Josh stops and he starts some of this fucking dorky ass dad humor shit.</p>
<p>And then I just go ahead and walk down about five yards like I&rsquo;m not participating in this</p>
<p>conversation.</p>
<p>Well, and he&rsquo;s the worst offender.</p>
<p>Like if you were stopped talking to someone, he would be five miles ahead of you.</p>
<p>A hundred percent.</p>
<p>He would never even remotely slow down.</p>
<p>What about Juliana saying, release me?</p>
<p>Release me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great one.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s worse, trying to get off the phone with somebody or trying to leave</p>
<p>a party.</p>
<p>The in-person is a million times worse because on the phone you can always like, oh my God,</p>
<p>I got to go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cutting out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cutting out really bad.</p>
<p>You can hang up so you can fake the entire thing.</p>
<p>And then send a text, sorry, my cell phone service is really bad right now.</p>
<p>And you can get out of that.</p>
<p>If the person isn&rsquo;t visibly seeing your social cues, which it sounds like Juliana&rsquo;s are probably</p>
<p>pretty palpable.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You know, because I think when I&rsquo;m kind of done with something, like it just starts everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s written all over me.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Immediately.</p>
<p>I just remembered I&rsquo;ve had somebody that I&rsquo;m trying to leave.</p>
<p>I get in my car and they stand between the car door and the car while I&rsquo;m sitting there.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t shut my door.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just yak mouth, just nonstop yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak.</p>
<p>This, you know, what we&rsquo;re starting to identify as this podcast progresses, ladies, is a lot</p>
<p>of this starts with yak mouths.</p>
<p>A hundred percent.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s followed up by people that are unable to take into account the feelings of</p>
<p>the listener and people that cannot read the room and people that cannot land the plane</p>
<p>or as Josh would say, shotgun it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So if we were to have in this podcast an enemy that everybody in our tribe unites against,</p>
<p>it would be those people.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I could not agree more.</p>
<p>Juliana, thank you for helping us get the word out there about these abusive people.</p>
<p>Release me.</p>
<p>Release.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best.</p>
<p>And listener, we are going to release you.</p>
