huge line of people</p><p>let&rsquo;s get to as many questions as we can</p><p>okay we sure can and this is for others</p><p>in the audience waim was on the in the</p><p>Green Room last week and got cut off</p><p>because of the vagaries of the various</p><p>systems in the internet so we&rsquo;ve got him</p><p>back on this week he&rsquo;s also outside of</p><p>work snuck out to his car looks great</p><p>and he going to ask this one question in</p><p>30 seconds and to the other people by</p><p>the way that that&rsquo;s happened to we urge</p><p>you to Rite into drberg.com we&rsquo;ll make</p><p>sure you eventually get on the air in</p><p>the meantime waim welcome to the show go</p><p>ahead with your one question with Dr</p><p>Berg thanks Steve and thanks Dr Berg for</p><p>having me uh so last month I had a</p><p>severe octive colitis flare up and they</p><p>put me on infliximab and a prazone taper</p><p>and so basically after that my blood</p><p>work started to read that I had two</p><p>liver enzymes that were uh very high a</p><p>and</p><p>Al um and I was wondering if you think</p><p>that I could take the liver cleanse</p><p>detox that you have to be able to kind</p><p>of get that in order or if there&rsquo;s</p><p>another uh way to do that that would be</p><p>better so is there a</p><p>um is a lot of the inflammation that</p><p>they detected in your stomach the small</p><p>intestine or the large intestine did</p><p>they tell</p><p>you so they said large intestine um</p><p>towards the end of the track</p><p>actually so I think um I think probably</p><p>the most important thing to do is to get</p><p>you on the right eating plan right off</p><p>the bat which should be the carnivore</p><p>diet because um what happens we want to</p><p>get rid of the inflammation we want to</p><p>calm down the the fire uh as the most</p><p>important thing and I think the</p><p>medications obviously have a side effect</p><p>of messing with your liver so I would</p><p>work with your doctor to see if um if</p><p>that&rsquo;s the right choice in the meantime</p><p>I think the the liver detox product that</p><p>I have could help to</p><p>um kind of protect the liver because um</p><p>there are certain ingredients that are</p><p>liver supportive so it can be a</p><p>protective thing for the liver but I</p><p>think the most important thing is to go</p><p>on a carnivore just to kind of heal the</p><p>gut um that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s high on glutamine</p><p>which will uh provide the</p><p>anti-inflammatory effect and support any</p><p>leaky gut going on um that&rsquo;s what I</p><p>would</p><p>do um the other thing is that um</p><p>is just kind of go back in to my videos</p><p>on that topic just so you can get more</p><p>knowledge about the area and and make</p><p>sure that you understand like all the</p><p>different causes so you can that now pre</p><p>going forward prevent it from coming</p><p>back once you get it</p><p>corrected all right thanks Dr bur</p><p>appreciate it sure great call Hen and</p><p>once again just to everyone out there I</p><p>know how annoying it can be when you</p><p>sign up and take your time we value your</p><p>time and then don&rsquo;t go on on the air a</p><p>couple things just to address first of</p><p>all we have a um you know a maximum</p><p>amount of spots available and yes we do</p><p>overbook a little bit because many times</p><p>people&rsquo;s cameras aren&rsquo;t working or this</p><p>that and the other so we want to make</p><p>sure but any of you in fact that</p><p>happened today to a couple and you know</p><p>who you are we&rsquo;d ask that you right back</p><p>in and we&rsquo;re going to put you back to</p><p>the top of the queue until you finally</p><p>get on the air uh with us so we</p><p>certainly don&rsquo;t ignore you uh and we</p><p>don&rsquo;t ignore our quiz questions and here</p><p>is the first one for the day Dr Bur</p><p>all right so if you have early morning</p><p>insomnia where let&rsquo;s say you get up a</p><p>little too early and you can&rsquo;t get back</p><p>to bed which mineral are you mostly</p><p>missing in your</p><p>diet sorry doc let me get your shot back</p><p>here all right so climb on that audience</p><p>and now let&rsquo;s head over to social media</p><p>and Hayden from YouTube which</p><p>supplements should someone on birth</p><p>control meds be</p><p>taking well the birth control pills do</p><p>um deplete things they create issues</p><p>they could create issues with your bile</p><p>and so you just I think</p><p>um I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily take a vitamin</p><p>while you&rsquo;re taking it I would just kind</p><p>of like see if you&rsquo;re deficient in</p><p>anything because if your diet is the</p><p>healthy version of the ketogenic diet</p><p>then you&rsquo;re probably going to be okay</p><p>but I will say that one one issue that</p><p>I&rsquo;ve seen in the past with birth control</p><p>pills is that uh that does mess with it</p><p>messes with the the gallbladder and</p><p>sometimes then you can&rsquo;t absorb from the</p><p>diet the fat cable nutrients like the</p><p>vitamin A D E K1 K2 so if you</p><p>notice problems with that especially</p><p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re driving at night it&rsquo;s</p><p>hard to see in the dark because you&rsquo;re</p><p>that&rsquo;s like a real easy one like vitamin</p><p>A deficiency then chances are instead of</p><p>taking vitamin A maybe you just take</p><p>some bile salts after you after you eat</p><p>and that might help you but</p><p>um yeah that&rsquo;s what I would do um and</p><p>just make sure you you re-evaluate your</p><p>what you&rsquo;re eating so you can get all</p><p>those nutrients that&rsquo;s terrific and in</p><p>addition to our green room um</p><p>participants Candace dwen and Curtis we</p><p>have others that are joining us from</p><p>around the world and they are as follows</p><p>uh we&rsquo;d like to give you all a warm</p><p>welcome uh to the UK Canada Mexico</p><p>Switzerland India Poland Romania Germany</p><p>Italy Germany excuse me Italy Gree</p><p>Greece Jordan South Africa Pakistan the</p><p>Philippines arria Nigeria Norway</p><p>Australia Belgium Chile the Virgin</p><p>Islands Oman P Pac uh excuse me</p><p>Palestine Scotland

for</p><p>everybody for joining us around the</p><p>world in the pursuit of a great healthy</p><p>life and many are achieving</p><p>that so let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s</p><p>go by the way we are I also didn&rsquo;t</p><p>announce today we are safely on Rumble</p><p>we are broadcasting it&rsquo;s showing up over</p><p>there so we urge all of the uh YouTube</p><p>patrons and again we&rsquo;re appreciative to</p><p>be on YouTube and on Facebook but it&rsquo;s a</p><p>good idea because of some of the um sort</p><p>of regulations that are popping up that</p><p>you always find Dr ber and the way to do</p><p>that is go over to rumble and uh you</p><p>know make sure you see where the show is</p><p>and is there a register can you what&rsquo;s</p><p>going on on Rumble with that do they</p><p>follow or what&rsquo;s the</p><p>routine you just you just subscribe you</p><p>press subscribe and you&rsquo;re good to go</p><p>okay that&rsquo;s great so you will never miss</p><p>anything from Dr ber in fact you will</p><p>gain more from them because there are no</p><p>censorship rules over there rumble&rsquo;s</p><p>allowing people to make decisions fors</p><p>and uh you know urge that way you can</p><p>research uh the traditional medical</p><p>stuff and all the Alternatives that</p><p>cumulatively make us and keep us all</p><p>healthy we hope okay Brenda from YouTube</p><p>I started taking the nutritional yeast</p><p>by crushing up Seven Tablets into my</p><p>electrolyte water I felt great but now</p><p>after 3 days I&rsquo;m constipated any</p><p>suggestions</p><p>I highly doubt that that&rsquo;s causing</p><p>constipation I would look at something</p><p>else because</p><p>it&rsquo;s nutritional use doesn&rsquo;t con it</p><p>won&rsquo;t it won&rsquo;t constipate it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s</p><p>a it&rsquo;s just a very small amount of</p><p>something there&rsquo;s not enough calories to</p><p>constipate but I would look at other</p><p>things that you maybe change in your</p><p>diet and it could possibly be too too</p><p>much salad or too much greens for some</p><p>people other people it&rsquo;s not enough</p><p>grains so I would look at anything out</p><p>of the ordinary that you added to this</p><p>mix I mean even the electrolyte powder</p><p>as well as B1 actually is known to get</p><p>rid of</p><p>constipation that being said one of the</p><p>interesting things about</p><p>constipation um is that you can also be</p><p>constipated from having not enough bio</p><p>salts and if you have too much bio salts</p><p>you can have diarrhea so um on quite a</p><p>few people I noticed that you give them</p><p>a little bio salts after they eat and</p><p>then now now they&rsquo;re actually really</p><p>they&rsquo;re able to go very nicely so</p><p>just that&rsquo;s just as a side note um but</p><p>watch my videos on constipation because</p><p>there&rsquo;s many different</p><p>reasons all right very good the audience</p><p>has always has leapt on the first</p><p>question which ask if you have early</p><p>morning insomnia which mineral are you</p><p>most likely missing and 66% of our</p><p>respondents say it&rsquo;s magnesium 24% say</p><p>it&rsquo;s potassium 5% say selenium and the</p><p>final five say it&rsquo;s B12</p><p>okay the answer is</p><p>magnesium magnesium magnesium now you</p><p>might say well it&rsquo;s easy to get</p><p>magnesium uh it&rsquo;s actually it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p><p>more difficult than you might think</p><p>because um the dark leafy green</p><p>vegetables that would be like kale Swiss</p><p>chart and especially spinach have a good</p><p>amount of potassium but they also have a</p><p>good amount of oxalates which can create</p><p>uh issues with people that are sensitive</p><p>like uh even AR</p><p>um even um kidney stones you know or</p><p>risks to kidney stones so but you can</p><p>easily overcompensate by adding a little</p><p>cheese to that spinach but kale in Swiss</p><p>CHS Swiss chart doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have</p><p>as much um oxalates also you can get it</p><p>from chocolate but of course you have to</p><p>watch the sugar but chocolate also has</p><p>oxalates so have your cheese with your</p><p>with your chocolate and then also it&rsquo;s</p><p>an almonds but almonds are also high in</p><p>oxalate so you know you want to do the</p><p>best you can yes it is true that</p><p>magnesium is a lot of different products</p><p>but you should just do the math sometime</p><p>and try to see how much magnesium you&rsquo;re</p><p>actually getting from the foods that</p><p>you&rsquo;re eating you&rsquo;re going to be</p><p>probably quite shocked to find out that</p><p>you&rsquo;re low and this is why you may need</p><p>to have a supplement I recommend</p><p>magnesium glycinate and have that um</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily like to be right</p><p>before bed but I think you&rsquo;re going to</p><p>find that actually you&rsquo;ll sleep been uh</p><p>better and you&rsquo;ll just feel like your</p><p>especially your muscles your muscles</p><p>will just feel relaxed you&rsquo;ll sleep</p><p>longer and it it t tends to lower</p><p>cortisol too so um like 45% of the</p><p>population is deficient in</p><p>magnesium so and on top of that vitamin</p><p>D is dependent on magnesium so you can&rsquo;t</p><p>even convert the active form of vitamin</p><p>D without magnesium so it&rsquo;s a really</p><p>important mineral um I did a video on it</p><p>and uh it went viral recently so if you</p><p>wanted to see that video watch it it&rsquo;s</p><p>called what is the first symptom of a</p><p>magnesium deficiency all right very good</p><p>we go to rumble good morning and this</p><p>person is using a bit of scripture to</p><p>identify himself Ephesians 4:10 from</p><p>Rumble I love Mexican food but how can</p><p>uh I do it on healthy keto good question</p><p>I&rsquo;m 70 years young and loving your</p><p>supplements thank you Dr</p><p>bird well you know if you go to actual</p><p>Mexico they have some seriously high</p><p>quality food and you can do keto but you</p><p>just have to do it without the corn corn</p><p>tortillas and the other other uh wheat</p><p>wheat type products um so you know you</p><p>have your guacamole you can do maybe</p><p>some almond tortillas and things like</p><p>that um but I think with all the</p><p>different sauces and things and without</p><p>omitted the rice and the beans I think</p><p>you can do it um in fact if you go to my</p><p>YouTube channel under uh and then look</p><p>at other channels I have a recipe</p><p>Channel and there&rsquo;s quite a few recipes</p><p>there you can check out which will make</p><p>keto delicious but</p><p>um yes you can do it you just have to</p><p>understand what&rsquo;s on the okay list and</p><p>what&rsquo;s on the not okay list all right</p><p>very good well uh speaking of the Green</p><p>Room Curtis from Hampton Virginia popped</p><p>off off because of one of the vagaries</p><p>of the system and he&rsquo;s back on I want to</p><p>make sure we don&rsquo;t lose him so make sure</p><p>you&rsquo;re unmuted Curtis and go ahead with</p><p>your terrific and captivating one</p><p>question that you will belt out in 30</p><p>seconds welcome to the show okay hello</p><p>Dr Burke thank you Hi how are you all</p><p>right uh my question is about fruit of</p><p>of course I love fruit and I&rsquo;ve been</p><p>watching you since February my question</p><p>is is it the sugar content that you&rsquo;re</p><p>concerned about in Fruit concerning keto</p><p>or do you consider fruit not being being</p><p>really healthy for the body because of</p><p>the sugar content you know it&rsquo;s</p><p>definitely better than um high fruit is</p><p>corn syrup and these other sugars but</p><p>there is a bit more sugar in fruit now</p><p>you might say well it&rsquo;s natural yes it</p><p>does have fiber it does s phytonutrients</p><p>absolutely um but the on the flip side a</p><p>great majority of the population has</p><p>metabolic issues they have insulin</p><p>resistance in which case they don&rsquo;t do</p><p>as well in fact I just gave up apples</p><p>when I was you know years ago I gave up</p><p>apples and I went from 111 pounds of</p><p>pure muscle and I&rsquo;m being sarcastic to</p><p>185 uh pretty A to B from just those</p><p>apples and that is has to do with the um</p><p>how they did hybrids with the fruit a</p><p>long ago we didn&rsquo;t have this sweet fruit</p><p>like we have now I mean honey crisp</p><p>apples is just like eating candy so even</p><p>the bananas they&rsquo;ve been hybrids for</p><p>more carbohyd hydrate that&rsquo;s really the</p><p>big problem and also um fruit typically</p><p>comes seasonal right not all year round</p><p>well and you could have it all year</p><p>around</p><p>so I&rsquo;m not I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;m against it</p><p>but I I would just say I would if you</p><p>have metabolic syndrome you might have</p><p>to not do fruit you can do some berries</p><p>um like even on my property there&rsquo;s some</p><p>indigenous apple and pear trees there&rsquo;s</p><p>a pear tree that these pears are not</p><p>even sweet at all um</p><p>so like that might be okay I haven&rsquo;t</p><p>tested the sugar content but um but you</p><p>know the bottom line is you might want</p><p>to just test it out on your body see how</p><p>you do do you feel better do you are you</p><p>trying to solve a problem uh healthwise</p><p>and uh um and play around with it to see</p><p>if it works out for you would you do</p><p>better or worse on</p><p>it</p><p>okay and it is hard to get on keto</p><p>because the carbs are are a bit high on</p><p>that so especially like like an apple</p><p>it&rsquo;s like 19 grams of carbs so you can</p><p>imagine if you&rsquo;re on keto you can easily</p><p>knock yourself out true okay understood</p><p>thanks a lot appreciate sure no problem</p><p>I tell you what this uh group of Green</p><p>Room participants is knocking it out of</p><p>the park with their their succinct</p><p>questions intelligent uh uh process own</p><p>thank you all very much and Curtis I&rsquo;m</p><p>glad we were able to get you back and</p><p>get you on the air uh and you just hang</p><p>around there Curtis and you can enjoy</p><p>the rest of the show from right where</p><p>you&rsquo;re at let&rsquo;s see um here&rsquo;s another</p><p>interesting name we&rsquo;d like to hear from</p><p>BH 2366 on Rumble what an interesting</p><p>name what&rsquo;s the best way to naturally</p><p>address Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma is the</p><p>same protocols we should follow with</p><p>other types of cancer and again not uh</p><p>you know replacing his medical</p><p>care well it&rsquo;s one of those things where</p><p>I can&rsquo;t I can&rsquo;t um have have any more</p><p>videos on YouTube about that well I can</p><p>but I you have to be within their</p><p>guidelines but I think if you go to</p><p>rumble and you search um those videos I</p><p>have the protocols that um that you</p><p>could you can research so you could see</p><p>what we&rsquo;re talking about um there is</p><p>some really interesting things about</p><p>cancer that I will say right off the bat</p><p>um they don&rsquo;t have&rsquo;t figured out okay</p><p>they have a lot of theories out there</p><p>and and um they don&rsquo;t they don&rsquo;t know</p><p>they don&rsquo;t know even though they might</p><p>sound like even the General Medical</p><p>consensus is blah blah blah but they</p><p>don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s not known uh yet but there&rsquo;s</p><p>some fascinating new theories coming up</p><p>that um make a lot of sense that have to</p><p>do with cancer being connected to um uh</p><p>fungus because if you take a look at</p><p>inside a tumor for example they recently</p><p>found out it&rsquo;s not sterile there&rsquo;s</p><p>microbes in there which is interesting</p><p>which could explain a lot of these wild</p><p>variables that it&rsquo;s that just don&rsquo;t</p><p>makees sense</p><p>um I won&rsquo;t get too much into it but the</p><p>point is I would search on Rumble um not</p><p>YouTube on the protocols that uh may be</p><p>worth doing a research to see if it can</p><p>work for you boy it is so exciting to be</p><p>on Rumble you know we are now</p><p>bulletproof uh in the service of our</p><p>various viewers and</p><p>those that have found a better life for</p><p>Dr Burg so you can find whatever answer</p><p>you want one way or the other let&rsquo;s go</p><p>back to um Rumble again let&rsquo;s see Ethan</p><p>loves keto he&rsquo;s from Rumble I started on</p><p>keto in October one and it feels like</p><p>I&rsquo;ve always been on it and I love it uh</p><p>was always bloated badly on on veggies</p><p>so I cut them out how long should it be</p><p>before I reintroduce</p><p>vegetables</p><p>well I think um the type of Keto I</p><p>recommend is U is starting out with</p><p>vegetables you&rsquo;re doing vegetables</p><p>you&rsquo;re doing a combination of vegetables</p><p>and meats so um you should start</p><p>immediately but I thought you going to</p><p>ask me something else how long do I have</p><p>to be on this before I can go back to my</p><p>original</p><p>diet</p><p>um um as long as you want to get well</p><p>but um there&rsquo;s a new diet that they&rsquo;re</p><p>trying to they are trying to push on us</p><p>all it&rsquo;s called the planetary Health</p><p>diet which you can have one and a half</p><p>ounces of meat per day I think you have</p><p>a fourth of or a fourth of an egg a day</p><p>uh or you can have um a little piece of</p><p>one bacon strip per day for your pro</p><p>protein because they want to get rid of</p><p>all these dangerous you know animal</p><p>products um but but you can have um 800</p><p>of your calories can be grains okay and</p><p>you can have S and a half teaspoons of</p><p>sugar and I&rsquo;m not kidding this is a diet</p><p>that they want to it&rsquo;s called the eat</p><p>Lancet diet that they want to put</p><p>everyone on so I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re looking</p><p>forward to some great great new things</p><p>coming up um I think it&rsquo;s actually not</p><p>going to happen because when I went</p><p>recently I went to the</p><p>butcher um it&rsquo;s organic butcher uh place</p><p>and there was a line that wrapped around</p><p>the entire it&rsquo;s going to be really hard</p><p>for people to give up their meat and</p><p>start eating these other foods and even</p><p>if they do uh you&rsquo;re going to see um</p><p>some major health problems because</p><p>people don&rsquo;t do well on these grains 800</p><p>calories of grains and they don&rsquo;t do</p><p>well in sugar and you&rsquo;re going to create</p><p>nutritional deficiencies so</p><p>um that&rsquo;s um so it&rsquo;s not going to work</p><p>basically and a uh simple way to</p><p>describe that diet is just a big picture</p><p>of Kool-Aid with plenty of sugar and</p><p>you&rsquo;re on the road to health so I&rsquo;m sure</p><p>you&rsquo;ll feel terrific oh yeah it&rsquo;ll work</p><p>it&rsquo;ll work bound to Something&rsquo;s GNA</p><p>happen Okay JS Fuji if I said that right</p><p>from Rumble again what are your thoughts</p><p>about drinking Bulletproof Coffee he</p><p>didn&rsquo;t mention whether he puts any cream</p><p>or anything but</p><p>anyway I think it&rsquo;s fine I think it&rsquo;s</p><p>fine the only thing when you do the</p><p>Bulletproof Coffee where you&rsquo;re adding</p><p>like butter or MCT oil to your coffee is</p><p>that realize it&rsquo;s good to do that when</p><p>you start out but if you&rsquo;re trying to</p><p>lose weight you may find that that fat</p><p>could be used as fuel more than your own</p><p>fat which means it could slow down your</p><p>ability to lose weight because you&rsquo;re</p><p>you&rsquo;re giving your body extra fuel to</p><p>live off ideally it&rsquo;d be nice to have</p><p>you live off your own fat and in which</p><p>case you once you get adapted maybe you</p><p>want not not consume this these extra</p><p>fats that aren&rsquo;t really part of your</p><p>protein but if you don&rsquo;t have a weight</p><p>problem I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a great thing</p><p>especially for the brain uh you might</p><p>find your cognitive improvements improve</p><p>as well as your your physical ex energy</p><p>from your exercise improves as well</p><p>because you your body starts using the</p><p>especially the the MCT oil for energy</p><p>you&rsquo;ll have a lot of energy okay very</p><p>good now I our producer Terry keeps me</p><p>on very short leash terms of keeping the</p><p>show moving and so I&rsquo;m putting up the</p><p>question before he scolded me for it</p><p>this is the second question so take that</p><p>Terry I remembered and Doc there&rsquo;s our</p><p>true</p><p>falser okay true or false the average</p><p>American consumes 45 gallons 120 170</p><p>lers of soda per year wow is that true</p><p>audience we&rsquo;ll find out let&rsquo;s see uh</p><p>midy from Facebook book well eating more</p><p>protein possibly cause M micro bulit Ura</p><p>oh God I should have read that micro</p><p>bulua does that ring a bell you ever had</p><p>that</p><p>doc sorry see sometimes I read these</p><p>questions not all the way through and</p><p>then I get stuck let&rsquo;s</p><p>just yeah remember we talked about that</p><p>Steve like when he gets a very specific</p><p>medical questions yeah um but I think um</p><p>here&rsquo;s the thing um if you EA too much</p><p>protein is it going to create like maybe</p><p>some waste products in the urine like</p><p>like ammonia or certain types of</p><p>problems for the kidney um the answer is</p><p>no um it&rsquo;s not but that being said you</p><p>you may find that if you already have</p><p>existing kidney damage the ability to</p><p>tolerate extra protein might not be</p><p>there so in which case you want to do</p><p>maybe moderate amounts of protein not</p><p>too high but I will say on the flip side</p><p>if if you start going on a low protein</p><p>diet low animal protein or</p><p>whatever you could you&rsquo;re more</p><p>susceptible to having um deficiencies of</p><p>protein which is very damaging to your</p><p>body uh so you know everyone&rsquo;s focusing</p><p>oh too much protein yeah but what about</p><p>if you have not enough amino acids you</p><p>create a worse problem so um I would</p><p>just recommend doing moderate amounts of</p><p>protein and you don&rsquo;t have to worry</p><p>about anything all right well I tell you</p><p>what the can you believe how fast the</p><p>audience got back to our question we</p><p>just asked the average American consumes</p><p>45 gallons or 170 lers of soda per year</p><p>and 95% of our respondents say it&rsquo;s true</p><p>and 5% say how could you do such a thing</p><p>it&rsquo;s</p><p>false it&rsquo;s absolutely true it used to be</p><p>58</p><p>gallons but now it&rsquo;s uh what 48 gall</p><p>and um also do you know how much water</p><p>Steve you know how much water someone</p><p>consumes 58 gallons so just a little bit</p><p>more wow so someone&rsquo;s drinking a lot of</p><p>soda and I know Soda is hydrating and um</p><p>some of these beverage companies you</p><p>know they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re definitely um</p><p>supporting the anti-obesity</p><p>movements which is kind of ironic</p><p>because um like this liquid candy I&rsquo;m</p><p>sorry soda is just so so much sugar and</p><p>uh without the um without the nutrients</p><p>so you&rsquo;re creating a</p><p>situation that is really going to put</p><p>your body in a especially your liver in</p><p>a state of danger when you add that much</p><p>and I know um growing up um we used to</p><p>get cases of soda at different parties</p><p>and didn&rsquo;t even think twice but of</p><p>course that was that trigger was sugar</p><p>cane it wasn&rsquo;t the high fructose corn</p><p>syrup they have now but um but yes a lot</p><p>of people are drinking a tremendous</p><p>amount of soda without even thinking</p><p>twice and then on top of that if you&rsquo;re</p><p>adding a burger with fries to that soda</p><p>unbelievable how you even survive that</p><p>that&rsquo;s a lot of lot of problems for your</p><p>kidneys your eyes your arteries and your</p><p>nerves wow that meal you described I</p><p>think is a number three you get all the</p><p>ingredients there by the way just to</p><p>confirm is that Sugar soda not diet or</p><p>do it matter the 45 or however many</p><p>gallons yeah I&rsquo;m talking about I&rsquo;m</p><p>talking about the the typical hypose</p><p>corn syrup sweetened yeah I&rsquo;m not</p><p>talking about the diet sodas that&rsquo;s a</p><p>different a different question yeah all</p><p>right well maybe we&rsquo;ll see that soon</p><p>Tanya from Facebook are apple cider</p><p>vinegar pills just as good as drinking</p><p>it that&rsquo;s one of the questions that is</p><p>the last question we&rsquo;re going to get to</p><p>that well okay let&rsquo;s that isn&rsquo;t that</p><p>something</p><p>Serendipity uh okay let&rsquo;s move on um</p><p>Tracy from YouTube what dietary</p><p>recommendations would you offer for a</p><p>teenager I would I would recommend the</p><p>same diet as an adult however I would</p><p>probably depending on the situation make</p><p>sure that you&rsquo;re doing the three meals</p><p>no snacks and not necessarily like two</p><p>meals unless you have a way problem and</p><p>definitely not one male because children</p><p>or teenagers as they&rsquo;re developing they</p><p>we have to really make sure they have</p><p>the enough calories as well as enough</p><p>nutrients in the calories um very</p><p>important uh but I&rsquo;m if you did the</p><p>healthy version of the ketogenic diet</p><p>that I recommend and just did three</p><p>meals like that without snacks that</p><p>would be awesome that would actually be</p><p>very healthy in fact um I</p><p>would if if I if I if I was a teenager</p><p>and I knew about this I would that&rsquo;s</p><p>what I would be eating probably wouldn&rsquo;t</p><p>have the acne that I had probably I</p><p>would have more endurance especially</p><p>going through wrestling and uh and not I</p><p>would not do what I did which is go as a</p><p>lower weight class and try to starve</p><p>myself that was a big mistake all right</p><p>very good Anna from YouTube uh do you</p><p>have recommendations on CI it&rsquo;s a</p><p>bacteria that creates diarrhea and</p><p>Colitis my brother still fighting it</p><p>after a round of</p><p>antibiotics yeah you have to have a um</p><p>more powerful probiotic to solve that</p><p>issue so I would do find something</p><p>that&rsquo;s really strong and probably double</p><p>double the Dos dosage as well as</p><p>consuming on a daily basis at least one</p><p>cup of raw</p><p>sauerkraut and and then in the evening</p><p>after dinner have a cup of whole</p><p>milk uh plain without sweetened kefir if</p><p>you can find the kefir from goats or</p><p>sheep that would be better than the</p><p>cow&rsquo;s milk but any kefir will do that</p><p>way you have your pro um additional</p><p>microbes that can help you all right</p><p>let&rsquo;s get personal now because but a lie</p><p>from YouTube how can I fix keto tongue e</p><p>i shouldn&rsquo;t say that am I using your</p><p>electrolyte solution I am using your</p><p>electrolyte solution and eating lots of</p><p>veggies what else can I be doing I&rsquo;m</p><p>sorry for teasing you but a lie I&rsquo;m sure</p><p>that&rsquo;s</p><p>awful yeah I think what I would do um is</p><p>would make sure for that problem you</p><p>like you already told me you already</p><p>kind of gave me the answer of taking</p><p>enough the be vitamins and also eating</p><p>the healthy version with vegetables but</p><p>I would also uh add um try to get your</p><p>carbs down low but also at the same time</p><p>drink more fluids and also make sure you</p><p>have enough omega-3 fatty</p><p>acids right like fish oil um I&rsquo;m sorry C</p><p>oil and I I consume consume a really</p><p>good amount of CER oil and um I also</p><p>have my trace minerals in the morning</p><p>with it has the zinc and then I have</p><p>magnesium as well and then um a little</p><p>later I&rsquo;ll do a little electrolytes and</p><p>maybe the nutritional yeast but that</p><p>combination I&rsquo;ve never seen a problem</p><p>with with side effects from doing the</p><p>keto if you do that very good let&rsquo;s go</p><p>to The Equalizer as he calls himself</p><p>from Rumble how do you feel about Stevia</p><p>uh sweetened</p><p>sodas speaking of sodas I think they&rsquo;re</p><p>great especially since we&rsquo;re on the</p><p>topic of sodas I think it&rsquo;s a great</p><p>alternative um when you buy the Zia or</p><p>whatever they&rsquo;re called the sodas I</p><p>would make sure that you read uh that</p><p>the get the ones without the</p><p>caffeine so uh but yeah those are great</p><p>as a substitute I think they&rsquo;re awesome</p><p>um so a lot of people don&rsquo;t know about</p><p>them they taste just like a soda</p><p>and it&rsquo;s flavored with stevia</p><p>um you know there&rsquo;s something recently</p><p>that I tried I really like for some</p><p>reason some people don&rsquo;t like it but I</p><p>like tonic water but sugar-free I don&rsquo;t</p><p>know why I like that it&rsquo;s like bitter um</p><p>but U most of it has sugar so you have</p><p>to read the ingredients but for some</p><p>reason my body loves tonic water</p><p>interesting I like the smell of dead</p><p>skunks on the road so the thing my</p><p>family&rsquo;s grossed out by it and I don&rsquo;t</p><p>smoke pot but I like the smell of it in</p><p>the hallway we have some neighbors that</p><p>do it and it has that same skunky smell</p><p>so I don&rsquo;t know whether Co knocked out</p><p>my sense of smell but those are two</p><p>things Dead Skunk on the road and pot</p><p>good quality pot smoke in the hallway</p><p>for some reason you know I find that</p><p>great and that&rsquo;s really an important</p><p>topic for the</p><p>show all right yeah we need to talk</p><p>later about that okay okay very good</p><p>let&rsquo;s I have I do have a dead stunk on</p><p>the side of the road I&rsquo;ll bring it</p><p>over that&rsquo;s great all right let&rsquo;s see uh</p><p>let&rsquo;s go to the next Quiz question and</p><p>our producer Terry said you know you&rsquo;re</p><p>bragging about getting up but you were</p><p>still 3 minutes late and uh now I&rsquo;m</p><p>almost three minutes late again so</p><p>here&rsquo;s the next Quiz question which is</p><p>quiz question number</p><p>three okay why are women</p><p>60% less likely to get cancer and 70%</p><p>less likely to die from it compared to</p><p>men that seems</p><p>unfair uh let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s go to another</p><p>one you&rsquo;re right it is I know I mean</p><p>gosh</p><p>ladies um okay Malcolm from Facebook</p><p>will 16 hours of facing help with</p><p>histamine</p><p>resistance you said f fasting or his F</p><p>fasting fasting yeah um I think it will</p><p>I think it will I think you know there&rsquo;s</p><p>so many things that clear up when you do</p><p>like prolong fast even allergies um so</p><p>it&rsquo;s kind of</p><p>a kind of a a nice little recovery</p><p>healing situation that can occur uh if</p><p>you do a prolonged fast I I would try it</p><p>and see what happens I mean so many</p><p>things can change and it&rsquo;s a way to uh</p><p>um kind of uh shock your system into</p><p>working right another thing that I think</p><p>if you have high Hines or even like</p><p>allergies doing those cold baths really</p><p>are amazing so I have one of those</p><p>immersion cold immersion tanks and um as</p><p>much as I hate getting in there it</p><p>really makes you feel better when you</p><p>get</p><p>out but it also has um an interesting</p><p>effect on various uh allergies and uh</p><p>other problems you&rsquo;re running into um</p><p>but it&rsquo;s definitely a shocker when you</p><p>get in there at 50 degrees uh for five</p><p>minutes wow so you&rsquo;re holding out for</p><p>the whole five minutes now we remember</p><p>you sort of easing your way into it but</p><p>you can tolerate that that long yeah</p><p>yeah I can I can tolerate it&rsquo;s just yeah</p><p>just getting used to it you got to</p><p>breathe through it though the key is the</p><p>breathing because you initially you&rsquo;re</p><p>hyperventilating your body gets used to</p><p>it and then it it&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s</p><p>more comfortable it&rsquo;s just that you can</p><p>your tolerance goes up you can tolerate</p><p>it better for some reason interesting</p><p>Blunts and Otter this soul is calling</p><p>themselves from Rumble my</p><p>63-year-old uh mom has</p><p>hyperthyroidism could she uh safely do a</p><p>week of a weekl long</p><p>fast I don&rsquo;t know I think I think she</p><p>could I would um but I would make sure</p><p>you take the right nutrients the thing</p><p>you have to be careful about with a</p><p>hyper thyroid is not to take celp not to</p><p>take iodine not to take</p><p>bile salts because that those three</p><p>things can increase the uh the function</p><p>of the thyroid and you don&rsquo;t want to do</p><p>that I think a good thing to take would</p><p>be</p><p>um maybe um the cruciferous vegetables</p><p>but that&rsquo;s like when you&rsquo;re eating now</p><p>um because um apparently that can help</p><p>help to some degree but that being said</p><p>I think a prolong fast would be a very</p><p>smart thing to do all right very good</p><p>Gina has an interesting question from</p><p>YouTube what are the down sides of</p><p>intermittent fasting and doing extended</p><p>high-intensity</p><p>cardio well the down um the negatives</p><p>are that you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s freaking</p><p>expensive because you have to buy all</p><p>these new clothes you know you lose all</p><p>this weight and you start uh getting</p><p>younger as you get older and that&rsquo;s</p><p>always a problem um and uh you said with</p><p>exercise too exercise high intensity</p><p>yes</p><p>yeah the effort of doing that is really</p><p>a pain in the butt but um but the</p><p>benefits yeah are kind of are going to</p><p>outweigh it but I I think the downside</p><p>the the negative side would be doing it</p><p>incorrectly like if you&rsquo;re create</p><p>nutritional deficiencies or let&rsquo;s say</p><p>for example you&rsquo;re too th thin going</p><p>into this it&rsquo;s difficult to do because</p><p>you will lose weight you know so these</p><p>are all things you have to look at and</p><p>also make sure if you&rsquo;re not to do it if</p><p>you&rsquo;re or lactating</p><p>um but um the intense exercise if you&rsquo;re</p><p>and just to be serious about that</p><p>there&rsquo;s a really cool thing that we&rsquo;re</p><p>going to come out</p><p>with very soon I keep saying that right</p><p>which is uh will measure your autonomic</p><p>nervous system to determine your stress</p><p>and Recovery you can actually visualize</p><p>what&rsquo;s happening with your nervous</p><p>system so then you can know if you can</p><p>handle a high-intensity exercise</p><p>training and there&rsquo;s certain days like I</p><p>can&rsquo;t because it&rsquo;s slow because I just I</p><p>overtrained or the day before or</p><p>something like that so this this would</p><p>be very important to know when where</p><p>your um ability to recover is at like</p><p>because if you have a poor recovery and</p><p>you do a high-intensity interval</p><p>training it can worsen things because</p><p>you don&rsquo;t have the recovery to deal with</p><p>it so you&rsquo;re just adding more stress it</p><p>could affect your sleep I&rsquo;ll give you</p><p>one example one lady came into my office</p><p>when I had this testing device and</p><p>measured her after an exercise bout and</p><p>her she got her pulse rate up to</p><p>158 okay she came back the next day her</p><p>pulse rate was still</p><p>158 it did not come down she did not</p><p>sleep so that would be really bad for</p><p>her to do a high-intensity exercise</p><p>training uh because she can&rsquo;t push the</p><p>pulse right down but this is a great</p><p>device that you&rsquo;ll be able to get so you</p><p>can do your own experiments and your own</p><p>testing and your own lab to see what</p><p>works for you and where you&rsquo;re at and uh</p><p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be very important</p><p>all right well there&rsquo;s also hundreds of</p><p>thousands of people like myself around</p><p>the world that want to know about</p><p>growing inhouse any updates on that</p><p>going have a nice little Garden in your</p><p>house or better soil I think you talked</p><p>about instead of the hydroponic stuff</p><p>are we any closer to that yeah we we</p><p>just yeah we we&rsquo;re just completing a</p><p>course on how to grow</p><p>um</p><p>amazing uh micro greens indoors oh boy</p><p>so that&rsquo;s almost done and then we&rsquo;re</p><p>we&rsquo;re starting um a new YouTube channel</p><p>on that too we&rsquo;re going to show people</p><p>um some really great things related to</p><p>how to grow your own food and the</p><p>importance of the soil and what it does</p><p>and and really make it simple because</p><p>there are already amazing channels out</p><p>there but sometimes um you know either</p><p>they don&rsquo;t explain it right or they keep</p><p>it complex or they might you know to</p><p>even to get to the the meat of the topic</p><p>you have to it&rsquo;s like 45 minutes into it</p><p>and then they eventually tell you so</p><p>we&rsquo;re going to just have short videos to</p><p>give you some great information on how</p><p>to grow your own food really excited</p><p>about that doc as I&rsquo;m sure are many</p><p>others okay so quiz question number</p><p>three ask why are women which makes me</p><p>mad 60% less likely to get cancer and</p><p>70% less likely to die um from it</p><p>compared to you and me doctor uh and</p><p>let&rsquo;s find out what the audience said um</p><p>46 of responded say it&rsquo;s because of the</p><p>effects of testosterone 24% of them say</p><p>it&rsquo;s because men don&rsquo;t get checkups as</p><p>much as women I bet that&rsquo;s true and 10%</p><p>say it&rsquo;s because men have higher levels</p><p>of stress yes we&rsquo;re under a lot of</p><p>pressure</p><p>ladies well it is true with the</p><p>testosterone it is true with the</p><p>testosterone</p><p>uh</p><p>testosterone tends to keep the immune</p><p>system a little bit weaker but but</p><p>that&rsquo;s not the big answer the big answer</p><p>has to do with the um women have two X</p><p>chromosomes and apparently that um is</p><p>correlated to a stronger immune system</p><p>where men has they have this one X and</p><p>then they have a y chromosome which they</p><p>kind of have they&rsquo;re not as strong with</p><p>that with the immune system so maybe</p><p>that&rsquo;s the survival techniques because</p><p>women carry you know they carry the um</p><p>the baby and they perpetuate the um</p><p>their race through fertility and all</p><p>that but um and also I think there is an</p><p>estrogen aspect too estrogen is the</p><p>powerful antioxidant too but um so</p><p>that&rsquo;s one advantage the um on the flip</p><p>side um women have a a worse problem</p><p>with autoimmune worse outcome</p><p>because the immune system is apparently</p><p>sometimes a little bit more sensitive to</p><p>things or more</p><p>overactive and so that&rsquo;s another another</p><p>topic but for the the good thing is your</p><p>risk for cancer and risk from dying from</p><p>cancer is significantly lower than men</p><p>all right as a so this just just kind of</p><p>what you can do if you&rsquo;re a man is you</p><p>can um actively and</p><p>aggressively get healthy so you can</p><p>avoid so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about</p><p>it how about that very good well I can&rsquo;t</p><p>we&rsquo;re now going to prove that women are</p><p>less stressful than men by going to</p><p>Candice and she looks very relaxed and</p><p>will surely outlive both of us Dr bur</p><p>Candace you&rsquo;re on the air with your one</p><p>question 30 seconds</p><p>go good morning Dr Berg I want to start</p><p>off by saying thank you so much for your</p><p>service your products and your</p><p>informative videos I was inspired to</p><p>begin intermittent fasting and keto</p><p>again and my question is um without a</p><p>gallbladder for 15 years and with um</p><p>non-alcoholic fatty disease symptoms for</p><p>the last five years should I take the</p><p>gallbladder formula and the liver</p><p>cleanse at the same time each day or</p><p>should I start with the gallbladder</p><p>formula and then transition to the liver</p><p>cleanse what&rsquo;s your suggestion on this</p><p>good question I think both of those are</p><p>going to be good for you because both of</p><p>them actually will remove fat from the</p><p>liver and I&rsquo;m assuming you are on the</p><p>healthy version of Keto but that little</p><p>bit of Bio salt will actually help you</p><p>have a little bit more bile to extract</p><p>more fat cable nutrients as well as all</p><p>the the phytonutrients from the plants</p><p>which are from salad which are fat cble</p><p>so that both of that would both of those</p><p>things would help you but as far as the</p><p>liver detox there&rsquo;s some really great</p><p>herbs in there that will help your liver</p><p>in general work better so I think you</p><p>take them at the same time you just want</p><p>to make sure that you take um the</p><p>gallbladder one after the meal just take</p><p>one after the meal and</p><p>um I think um that would be</p><p>smart and also I if you start noticing</p><p>um</p><p>like problems with your vision at night</p><p>when you&rsquo;re driving that all that means</p><p>is like you need more bile so I would</p><p>kind of really look at those indicators</p><p>for fat soluble vitamin deficiencies to</p><p>see if you&rsquo;re getting enough bile</p><p>another indication this probably is kind</p><p>of you know strange thing to say but um</p><p>if your stool</p><p>floats and it&rsquo;s light colored that means</p><p>that you don&rsquo;t have enough bile because</p><p>the there&rsquo;s too much fat in there and</p><p>it&rsquo;s floating so it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s a way to</p><p>indirectly see if you&rsquo;re getting enough</p><p>of that</p><p>bile um one more thing uh choline would</p><p>be something to take because choline</p><p>directly gets rid of fat off the liver</p><p>as well so just make mental note of</p><p>that is that a product that you actually</p><p>sell uh on your website Coline or is</p><p>that just a supplement you can just get</p><p>a supplement uh you can get something</p><p>called um phosph faetal choline I think</p><p>it&rsquo;s called and then um or there&rsquo;s other</p><p>types of choline too but any any of</p><p>those cholines would would</p><p>work all right thank you very much I</p><p>appreciate Dr B thanks for a great call</p><p>Candace or video session and we</p><p>appreciate it as always love to hear</p><p>back uh you know in some weeks or months</p><p>uh as to what we hope would be the</p><p>improvements in your various symptoms</p><p>let&rsquo;s see Crystal from YouTube what are</p><p>your recommendations for a diabetic who</p><p>wants to start intermittent fasting is</p><p>it even safe to do</p><p>so well it&rsquo;s um it&rsquo;s not safe to not do</p><p>it I mean you it&rsquo;s like U sometimes</p><p>people think that wow is it is it going</p><p>to be bad if I start doing fasting if</p><p>I&rsquo;m a diabetic think about what&rsquo;s going</p><p>to happen if you do that number</p><p>one you&rsquo;re not going to be stimulating</p><p>the pancreas okay because you&rsquo;re not</p><p>eating you&rsquo;re fasting so you&rsquo;re going to</p><p>you&rsquo;ll have less um triggering of the</p><p>pancreas which will give the pancreas a</p><p>chance to breathe a little bit because</p><p>the eyelids of langerhan the cells that</p><p>the beta cells have been overworked and</p><p>so you can give those a chance to be</p><p>revived the other thing is like you&rsquo;re</p><p>not</p><p>um eating so then your body then is</p><p>forced to go after the fat Fu</p><p>ketones and not run on sugar which is</p><p>going to automatically take a big stress</p><p>off your</p><p>diabetes and what is diabetes it&rsquo;s a</p><p>disease of too much sugar so if we don&rsquo;t</p><p>eat that would be the ultimate solution</p><p>because you&rsquo;re not going to add sugar to</p><p>the system and any sugar needed your</p><p>body can make it instead you&rsquo;re running</p><p>in ketones and fat and uh it&rsquo;s the best</p><p>thing for a diabetic to do that is not</p><p>damaging at all even if you&rsquo;re a type</p><p>one diabetic um the goal would be to</p><p>take the least amount of insulin as</p><p>possible well what triggers insulin</p><p>carbs so I think um yes you need to do</p><p>it it&rsquo;s not damaging it&rsquo;s going to be</p><p>very therapeutic to be on keto if you&rsquo;re</p><p>a</p><p>diabetic very good let&rsquo;s go ahead with</p><p>quiz question number</p><p>four what is the primary reason why</p><p>people are more overweight now than in</p><p>the 50s or the 60s climb on at</p><p>audience sure there&rsquo;s many reasons but</p><p>what this question is specific to what</p><p>is the biggest reason</p><p>okay because from this difference see</p><p>see what you guys come up with all right</p><p>well I&rsquo;ll tell you what FJ Lopez 90 from</p><p>Rumble uh must have known what the</p><p>answer was because he has</p><p>lost5 pounds in nearly a year and wants</p><p>to thank you for your advice thank you</p><p>Dr so</p><p>congratulations U maybe e Mr Lopez for</p><p>doing a great job on that let&rsquo;s see um</p><p>that&rsquo;s fantastic a&rsquo;t that</p><p>great here we go so Belinda from</p><p>Facebook um I follow your Healthy keto</p><p>and intermittent fasting protocols and I</p><p>feel great but my gallbladder sludge has</p><p>gotten thicker in the process and</p><p>started forming pops ouch uh what can I</p><p>do to remove them and while avoiding the</p><p>surgery I would take a product called</p><p>tdka tdup and I would take two in the</p><p>morning on an empty stomach and two in</p><p>the afternoon on an empty stomach what</p><p>that&rsquo;s going to do it&rsquo;s going to give</p><p>you more of a nice</p><p>flowing bile that&rsquo;s going through those</p><p>little tubes and um that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what</p><p>you need to actually kind of uh correct</p><p>your situation</p><p>I think probably what happened is when</p><p>people lose weight on keto and they burn</p><p>fat the fat cell has to release not just</p><p>triglycerides but cholesterol too that&rsquo;s</p><p>part of the fat so as you dump more more</p><p>chuster through the the liver and the</p><p>gallbladder boy you might you might need</p><p>to make sure you have enough bile to</p><p>handle all that cholesterol in which</p><p>case you know normally you should have</p><p>it but if you&rsquo;re efficient that&rsquo;s when</p><p>you have problems okay very good and</p><p>last but not least in our Green Room uh</p><p>uh we have D and D&rsquo;s camera or something</p><p>is botched so we&rsquo;re going to take her as</p><p>a phone call D are you</p><p>there I am here thank you wonderful go</p><p>ahead with your one question for Dr</p><p>bird well Dr bird first I want to thank</p><p>you for all your wisdom and all that you</p><p>do for everybody so thank you very much</p><p>for that um you helped a friend of mine</p><p>her kids many many years ago with some</p><p>severe environmental and food allergies</p><p>and rheumatoid arthritis for her</p><p>six-year-old kid that couldn&rsquo;t walk</p><p>anyway my question specifically is what</p><p>do you recommend for food allergies such</p><p>as black pepper and Elian in</p><p>milk there&rsquo;s a couple things I would do</p><p>there&rsquo;s when I used to have people on</p><p>intermittent fasting but really it&rsquo;s the</p><p>prolong fasting periodic prolong fasting</p><p>look let&rsquo;s say every two weeks you do a</p><p>48 hour fast or every month you do a</p><p>72-hour fast I think that would go a</p><p>long way with getting rid of those</p><p>allergies or sensitivities or</p><p>intolerances um that&rsquo;s one thing the</p><p>other thing that you could do is</p><p>um do that ice paath I mean it&rsquo;s really</p><p>interesting it uh it helps your immune</p><p>system it stimulates immune system</p><p>because you&rsquo;re adding a stress so I</p><p>think the combination of both of those</p><p>would be very beneficial um there&rsquo;s</p><p>other other other things too you can</p><p>avoid you know get on keto but avoid</p><p>those things that you&rsquo;re allergic to for</p><p>a period of time and then go back on</p><p>them and see if that doesn&rsquo;t help reset</p><p>things but I think the big biggest thing</p><p>is the prolong fasting situation that&rsquo;s</p><p>very powerful because it actually</p><p>stimulates Ates uh new stem cells within</p><p>the immune system that then make you</p><p>more tolerant of</p><p>things I sure appreciate that Dr Berg I</p><p>really do thank you sure no problem all</p><p>right well D wraps it up for our Green</p><p>Room callers and what a great group we</p><p>had today once again those of you who</p><p>didn&rsquo;t make it please write into</p><p>drberg.com and we&rsquo;re going to get you a</p><p>new slot until we finally get you uh on</p><p>the air let&rsquo;s see quiz question number</p><p>four asked uh what is the primary reason</p><p>why people are more overweight now than</p><p>in the 50s and 60s and I&rsquo;m old enough to</p><p>remember those days uh 75% of our</p><p>respondents say there&rsquo;s more sugars like</p><p>high fructose syrups in our Foods these</p><p>days 20% say that there&rsquo;s an overall</p><p>increase of ultr processed foods that</p><p>are available and 5% say it&rsquo;s because of</p><p>lower levels of physical activity uh in</p><p>an age</p><p>population boy I think there&rsquo;s some</p><p>truth in all</p><p>that yes</p><p>because is it you know could it be that</p><p>we&rsquo;re just eating less saturated fat no</p><p>is it that we&rsquo;re eating um are we you</p><p>know smoking less is that is that doing</p><p>it no is it the alcohol no we we</p><p>probably still do the same amount of</p><p>alcohol but you know um I looked at this</p><p>very very deeply and it</p><p>there&rsquo;s many reasons the exercise is is</p><p>definitely less uh the high fructose</p><p>corn syrup is more that&rsquo;s a big one the</p><p>seed oils are more but there&rsquo;s something</p><p>else that I think that&rsquo;s going on that</p><p>is contributing</p><p>to this problem and I think it has to do</p><p>with the frequent eating with the</p><p>snacking and uh I remember growing up</p><p>and parents saying don&rsquo;t spoil your</p><p>dinner right so we wouldn&rsquo;t have these</p><p>snacks uh I don&rsquo;t know about you Steve</p><p>did you have as many snacks growing up</p><p>well we didn&rsquo;t have time for it I&rsquo;m 69</p><p>so I&rsquo;m definitely Opie of Mayberry kind</p><p>of kid and we actually ate pretty</p><p>crappily so we would ride our little</p><p>bicycles and go crazy then at noon one</p><p>nice mother would come out with um an</p><p>ice tray full of Kool-Aid sugar cubes</p><p>and they&rsquo;d put them in a paper towel and</p><p>we&rsquo;d slurp on them that&rsquo;s pure sugar</p><p>then maybe a Wonderbread peanut butter</p><p>and jelly sandwich with the crust cut</p><p>off which is probably the only good part</p><p>but we were all thin and so we had very</p><p>low caloric intake and we we burned</p><p>calories all day long so in my case I</p><p>can&rsquo;t say that we ate healthier but we</p><p>ate a hell of a lot less and we</p><p>exercised all day long and here&rsquo;s the</p><p>interesting thing if you saw a heavy</p><p>person when you were a kid it would be</p><p>like oh my god look because there was n</p><p>nobody on the horizon that was</p><p>overweight and you thought that poor</p><p>person would happen to them boy that&rsquo;s</p><p>the norm</p><p>now</p><p>I think um yeah and I think if you</p><p>notice they really um everyone&rsquo;s pushing</p><p>these uh these mid mid morning</p><p>midafternoon snacks night snacks before</p><p>you go to bed have a snack the snacks</p><p>bring bring protein bars right it&rsquo;s just</p><p>constantly eating 247 I think that&rsquo;s a</p><p>problem um but I also I will say</p><p>exercise is also right up there at the</p><p>top as well and I would also say the</p><p>fructose I mean even like um in the</p><p>50s um did you have leader Big Gulp uh</p><p>sodas did you have these large uh 20</p><p>ounce sodas the answer is no you had a 6</p><p>and a half ounce one they were very</p><p>small so we&rsquo;re just drinking like this</p><p>like there going on a style it&rsquo;s like</p><p>it&rsquo;s pretty bad Steve so you want to</p><p>just uh start a new trend and not do</p><p>that yeah good measure of that was the</p><p>famous oh absolutely we had TV dinners</p><p>this little crappy aluminum tray with</p><p>about a square inch worth of dessert and</p><p>then you know a little chicken little</p><p>tiny potatoes and I&rsquo;m sure it wasn&rsquo;t all</p><p>great food but I that would be an</p><p>appetizer now I mean just getting</p><p>started so and we consider our whole</p><p>meal and I don&rsquo;t remember I remember</p><p>feeling sated oh boy that was great and</p><p>then you you know go leap around outside</p><p>like a little kid anyway let&rsquo;s go to our</p><p>final uh quiz question of the day and we</p><p>did address this earlier one of the</p><p>questions and you uh uh with great</p><p>discipline held off the answer until we</p><p>asked this question and here it</p><p>is true or false those keto apple cider</p><p>vinegar gummies can help you lose weight</p><p>all right climb on that audience let&rsquo;s</p><p>see Joanna from YouTube what are your</p><p>thoughts on using a high fiber diet to</p><p>address high cholesterol levels and</p><p>heart</p><p>disease I think I I I wouldn&rsquo;t</p><p>necessarily just go after the fiber I</p><p>would just consume a healthy version of</p><p>Keto which include which is like seven</p><p>to 10 cups of salad get your fiber from</p><p>your salad that will help your</p><p>cholesterol for sure but it&rsquo;s not just</p><p>about the fiber because so many people</p><p>are doing these plant-based shakes and</p><p>fiber and and the new functional fibers</p><p>it&rsquo;s like tapioca fiber and uh cable</p><p>cornstarch fiber and all these different</p><p>fibers and they&rsquo;re thinking oh yeah or</p><p>oatmeal and they&rsquo;re thinking oh yeah</p><p>this going to help my cholesterol well</p><p>it&rsquo;s the problem is we haven&rsquo;t tested</p><p>those new things yet and uh there&rsquo;s a</p><p>lot of carbohydrates in them but there&rsquo;s</p><p>not a lot of carbohydrates in celery I&rsquo;m</p><p>sorry like compared to other things yes</p><p>there&rsquo;s carbohydrates but not a lot of</p><p>sugars so there&rsquo;s a huge amount of fiber</p><p>in celery</p><p>so Steve I think it&rsquo;d be um a really</p><p>good experiment to see how many stocks</p><p>of celery you would have to eat</p><p>to to gain fat well that&rsquo;s all I eat do</p><p>you know my carbohydrates yeah that&rsquo;s</p><p>all I eat is I know well you already</p><p>that&rsquo;s all you eat but because I saw</p><p>your diet but yeah I think um I&rsquo;m</p><p>talking about other people oh yeah the</p><p>weak ones uhhuh I know them anyway</p><p>there&rsquo;s nothing exactly people that</p><p>don&rsquo;t have power that&rsquo;s right well</p><p>there&rsquo;s nothing weak about our audience</p><p>in terms of answering questions I just</p><p>threw out question quiz question number</p><p>five the final one uh which was a true</p><p>false keto ACV gummies can help you lose</p><p>weight and 92% of the audience say it&rsquo;s</p><p>false that disappointing 8% say it&rsquo;s</p><p>true it&rsquo;s false false false um don&rsquo;t</p><p>waste your money I I&rsquo;ll give you an</p><p>example one serving size of these</p><p>gummies is a little more than a teaspoon</p><p>of sugar a whole bottle is 30 teaspoons</p><p>of sugar it&rsquo;s just pure sugar the first</p><p>ingredient the second ingredient the</p><p>third ingredient is it&rsquo;s like glucose</p><p>syrup um corn syrup cane sugar I mean</p><p>like it&rsquo;s just made from sugar this is</p><p>not a keto thing I don&rsquo;t know how they</p><p>can legally call it keto but there&rsquo;s no</p><p>legal definition and then the amount of</p><p>Alid of vinegar that&rsquo;s in there Steve</p><p>it&rsquo;s like maybe seven drops if you take</p><p>an average serving of apple cider</p><p>vinegar which is one tablespoon that&rsquo;s</p><p>15</p><p>grams right so in in one serving of</p><p>gummies it&rsquo;s 500</p><p>milligrams so one bottle would be</p><p>equivalent to one tablespoon of that</p><p>appet of vinegar that you could buy very</p><p>inexpensively at the store and add that</p><p>to the water it&rsquo;s it is a scam a lot of</p><p>people are falling for it it doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>work look at the reviews it&rsquo;s just</p><p>terrible and you&rsquo;re just eating you&rsquo;re</p><p>just eating candy it should be in the</p><p>candy</p><p>section on that note Steve I got the</p><p>hint there um I want to just thank</p><p>everyone for uh listening in and your</p><p>wonderful questions and your attention</p><p>stay tuned for more more great content</p><p>this next week that&rsquo;s going to be</p><p>released on YouTube and other social</p><p>media like
