    <p>It&rsquo;s Hardcore History.</p>
<p>ATTENTION.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting sort of phenomenon,</p>
<p>I guess you could call it, that happens after we get</p>
<p>a Hardcore History series finished.</p>
<p>You begin to hear from people that are connected</p>
<p>with the subject matter, and you get opportunities,</p>
<p>for example, to talk to them or to interview them.</p>
<p>And the upside is, um&hellip;</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re usually people that you would really like to talk to.</p>
<p>The downside is, you&rsquo;ve just finished up, usually,</p>
<p>a lot of work and a lot of conversation,</p>
<p>and a lot of the audience&rsquo;s time on the subject matter.</p>
<p>So, everybody&rsquo;s usually ready for something new,</p>
<p>but then you get all these opportunities</p>
<p>that are too good to turn down,</p>
<p>that are on the bit of subject matter</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve just covered extensively.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the case today.</p>
<p>Now, actually, we&rsquo;ve held on to this show</p>
<p>for several months.</p>
<p>The author has a, um&hellip; that we&rsquo;re gonna talk to</p>
<p>has a new&hellip; three-set book compilation coming out,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been delayed.</p>
<p>I imagine November 2021 is probably a safe bet</p>
<p>for it at some point, though.</p>
<p>And so, we were holding on to this</p>
<p>so that we could release this</p>
<p>and have it coincide with the, um, the new offering.</p>
<p>But what that means is, I&rsquo;ve actually got another show</p>
<p>ready to come out real soon, right after this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be another interview with another author,</p>
<p>and this one won&rsquo;t be about the subject</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve recently talked about.</p>
<p>So, um, one way or another, we should have a couple of things</p>
<p>for you in quick succession, which is good because&hellip;</p>
<p>because we held on to this,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have anything coming out, uh,</p>
<p>a couple of months ago, as we planned.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re due a couple of shows in quick succession.</p>
<p>This one&rsquo;s with an author whose work I enjoyed so much.</p>
<p>And some of my favorite little things that we included,</p>
<p>these little hits by a&hellip; a little quote by an author.</p>
<p>Some of my favorite ones were by Ian W. Toll.</p>
<p>And, uh, he has multiple books besides these three,</p>
<p>but these three, from start to finish,</p>
<p>cover the Pacific War and the Second World War,</p>
<p>from about Pearl Harbor to the end.</p>
<p>Pacific Crucible, followed by The Conquering Tide,</p>
<p>followed by Twilight of the Gods.</p>
<p>Any one of these, of course, can be bought separately,</p>
<p>but with a three-book compilation coming out,</p>
<p>uh, we assume in November, uh, Ian W. Toll&rsquo;s, um&hellip;</p>
<p>you know, his combined work on&hellip; on this specific theater</p>
<p>in the Second World War will be complete and available,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>And so, when his people called, uh, right after we finished</p>
<p>the six-part series on the war in the Asia-Pacific Theater</p>
<p>and said, would you like to talk to Ian W. Toll,</p>
<p>I said, what you would expect me to say,</p>
<p>even though we&rsquo;ve talked about this subject a lot recently.</p>
<p>I said, yes, please.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, our conversation</p>
<p>with author Ian W. Toll.</p>
<p>‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™</p>
<p>Obviously, you know that I&rsquo;ve done 27 hours recently</p>
<p>on this subject, and I&rsquo;m sure the audience is gonna groan</p>
<p>when they see I have more of it.</p>
<p>Uh, but what I&rsquo;d like to do maybe, as, you know,</p>
<p>and I consider the conversation maybe to be going now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re recording anyway, but, um&hellip;</p>
<p>with a guy who has lived this like you&rsquo;ve lived it,</p>
<p>uh, you know, not just the writing of the books</p>
<p>and the research, but the speeches that you have to give</p>
<p>and everything else, um, I imagine that you have</p>
<p>all kinds of ideas in your head of things that have happened</p>
<p>that make this conflict wild and crazy.</p>
<p>Is there something that you wish the general public,</p>
<p>and I feel like my audience now has 27 hours of this,</p>
<p>so what can we tell them about this war</p>
<p>that is unusual or interesting?</p>
<p>Or if you could say that you wish the general public</p>
<p>knew something about this war that you know,</p>
<p>what would it be?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, there&rsquo;s a couple, I mean, there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just so many things I could say</p>
<p>in answer to that question, but, uh&hellip;</p>
<p>Um&hellip;</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we say this?</p>
<p>Um, that as a continental nation, we Americans,</p>
<p>we tend to think of war as war on land</p>
<p>before anything else.</p>
<p>And naval operations are a supporting feature of war,</p>
<p>a sort of supporting operation.</p>
<p>And, um, in the Second World War,</p>
<p>I mean, that certainly was true of the war in Europe.</p>
<p>Uh, I think you could say naval operations were,</p>
<p>uh, a supporting aspect of the campaign.</p>
<p>And then you need to invert your understanding</p>
<p>when you come to the Pacific.</p>
<p>You really need to just look at the map of the Pacific</p>
<p>and you see this as a sea war and an air war first.</p>
<p>And, uh, land operations, these island, um, island fights,</p>
<p>were playing a sort of supporting role</p>
<p>in the larger scheme.</p>
<p>And so, you know, just from the very beginning,</p>
<p>I think you need to invert your understanding in that way.</p>
<p>And once you do that, uh, this vast conflict</p>
<p>with the Pacific war becomes much easier to understand.</p>
<p>You know, as an American, uh, one of the things</p>
<p>that we really didn&rsquo;t get much of,</p>
<p>I mean, I have a, uh, life goes to war,</p>
<p>life goes to war book that probably came out in 1950.</p>
<p>And if you leave through the pages,</p>
<p>the vast, vast majority of this work</p>
<p>is about the Pacific theater,</p>
<p>the battles that Americans, uh, who followed the exploits</p>
<p>of the Marines or MacArthur are very familiar with,</p>
<p>the Tarawa&rsquo;s, the Peleliu&rsquo;s, the Iwo Jima&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But the whole Asia side of this conflict is enormous</p>
<p>once you delve into it, once you start to realize</p>
<p>how many people are involved.</p>
<p>Um, why is, and you know, also, I didn&rsquo;t even think about this,</p>
<p>but I mean, five years later, we&rsquo;re in a war in Korea.</p>
<p>We have Chinese troops entering the war after a certain point.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s all directly connected to the fallout,</p>
<p>uh, from this Asia Pacific war.</p>
<p>Um, why don&rsquo;t Americans know more,</p>
<p>and this includes yours truly,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we know more about the giant,</p>
<p>you know, you mentioned the naval war,</p>
<p>which it is to the United States,</p>
<p>but there was a giant land war in Asia also.</p>
<p>Right. Well, you know, I mean,</p>
<p>the simplest way to answer that is just that,</p>
<p>you know, we weren&rsquo;t involved in that war in a big way.</p>
<p>And Americans, like most people,</p>
<p>we tend to be most interested in the aspects of a conflict</p>
<p>in which our boys were directly involved.</p>
<p>So I think that goes part of the way to explaining that.</p>
<p>Um, I think it&rsquo;s also true that, uh, because, uh, Mao&rsquo;s China,</p>
<p>uh, uh, communists won the Civil War</p>
<p>after, uh, the end of the Second World War,</p>
<p>um, China became for many years, and in many ways still is,</p>
<p>somewhat of a black box from the outside.</p>
<p>Uh, and so the, the telling of the, of the story,</p>
<p>the history of that war, uh, was something</p>
<p>that was controlled directly by Mao&rsquo;s regime.</p>
<p>And, um, and there was just a limited, um, access,</p>
<p>uh, to that country in order to, to try to tell that story.</p>
<p>I, I think that there are good efforts now</p>
<p>to try to rectify this, to place the Sino-Japanese War</p>
<p>back in the center of the story of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>Uh, and my, my colleague, uh, Richard Frank</p>
<p>is, is writing another trilogy about the Asia-Pacific War,</p>
<p>as he calls it, in which he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s trying to rectify that bias.</p>
<p>And, and so I commend, uh, that work.</p>
<p>The first of his three volumes is out.</p>
<p>You know, when you look at the amount of,</p>
<p>uh, the amount of resources, uh, we would say GDP today,</p>
<p>all the things that Japan, a small island nation,</p>
<p>had to, uh, set aside and devote for naval construction,</p>
<p>you know, over the 20s and the 30s and into the 40s,</p>
<p>um, modern aircraft development,</p>
<p>and, and millions of men on the ground</p>
<p>who need to be supported in Asia.</p>
<p>You look at this and you just think to yourself,</p>
<p>and I think we said in the podcast,</p>
<p>I mean, the Japanese were already trying to eat an elephant</p>
<p>in terms of, of the task that they had set for themselves</p>
<p>before they even attacked Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>Then to attack the strongest Western nations on top of that.</p>
<p>I read an account of one historian who had said</p>
<p>that a Japanese, I&rsquo;m trying to quote from memory here,</p>
<p>a Japanese poet had described the war as like a slow motion,</p>
<p>natural disaster, suggesting that the Japanese felt like</p>
<p>they were almost like pulled into it, like a riptide.</p>
<p>Um, when you look at something like this,</p>
<p>does it look like the Japanese had,</p>
<p>I mean, I feel like they had no chance from the get-go.</p>
<p>Um, how does this look to you when you,</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve examined, uh, all of the records,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve looked at this, um, how do you&hellip;</p>
<p>I guess they were optimists, certainly,</p>
<p>but I mean, you guys have guys like the whole naval staff,</p>
<p>everybody was so pessimistic about that.</p>
<p>How do you think this, um, I guess what I&rsquo;m saying is,</p>
<p>do you see it as a one-sided affair from the get-go,</p>
<p>or did the Japanese have a chance to do something</p>
<p>really unexpected here?</p>
<p>You know, when I consider the counterfactuals, Dan,</p>
<p>I find it very hard to imagine any scenario</p>
<p>where the Japanese could have escaped this conflict, uh,</p>
<p>with, um, in a better situation than they were on December 6,</p>
<p>1941, the day before they attacked Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost impossible to imagine a scenario</p>
<p>where, uh, the war ends up working out for them.</p>
<p>And, uh, really what, what the Pacific War was</p>
<p>from the Japanese perspective was,</p>
<p>it was an enormous bet that, uh,</p>
<p>that Hitler was going to dominate Europe.</p>
<p>And, um, and that by dominating Europe,</p>
<p>he was essentially going to keep the United States</p>
<p>forever on the defensive, worried about the security</p>
<p>of our own hemisphere of South America.</p>
<p>And that, uh, in that situation,</p>
<p>we just would not, uh, be able to fight</p>
<p>a prolonged bloody war, uh, in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Of course, that was a very bad bet.</p>
<p>And it was a bet that was made, you know,</p>
<p>right at the moment when the German army</p>
<p>was being stopped outside the gates of Moscow.</p>
<p>You know a lot about this.</p>
<p>I know you did, like, a six-parter</p>
<p>on the, uh, on the war in the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>And, um, and one of the leaders of the Japanese regime,</p>
<p>I forget who, in a, in a, uh, being interrogated</p>
<p>after the war said, you know, if, um,</p>
<p>if we had made this decision just two weeks later,</p>
<p>we might have looked at what was happening in, uh, in Russia</p>
<p>and, and, uh, perceived that this was not going to be</p>
<p>a walkover for the Germans the way it appeared</p>
<p>that it was going to be in the, in the early months.</p>
<p>And that might have caused us to think twice</p>
<p>about attacking the Americans, uh, in Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>And so, uh, with that in mind,</p>
<p>when I, when I go through the counterfactuals,</p>
<p>I think the one thing that could have really tipped</p>
<p>the balance, uh, throughout the world, really,</p>
<p>but also in the Pacific, would be, uh, a Russian collapse.</p>
<p>Um, and, and some form of a truce on the Russian front.</p>
<p>Uh, Stalin had essentially repeated</p>
<p>what the Bolsheviks had done in 1917</p>
<p>and cut a deal, uh, to end that war,</p>
<p>allowing Hitler to redeploy, uh, his forces, uh,</p>
<p>against, uh, England.</p>
<p>You know, that, I think, um, could have,</p>
<p>have really changed the entire complexion</p>
<p>of the global conflict in a way that, uh, led us to,</p>
<p>to think, let&rsquo;s try to cut our losses in the Pacific</p>
<p>and, and not, uh, devote the kind of enormous effort</p>
<p>that it will require to conquer Japan at a time</p>
<p>when we really do have to worry about our Atlantic flank.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m going to piggyback off what you said,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Uh, I spoke to a, a German once who had said that,</p>
<p>essentially, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m paraphrasing here,</p>
<p>but that we blew it in the East,</p>
<p>that we were welcomed by some of the population there,</p>
<p>uh, as liberators, and our actions turned</p>
<p>those very people against us</p>
<p>and made our job that much tougher.</p>
<p>I think about the Pacific and the East Asia,</p>
<p>the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere,</p>
<p>and, and this, this idea that it&rsquo;s Asia for the Asians</p>
<p>and the tying in of the Pan-Asianism</p>
<p>and the Japanese, uh, portraying themselves</p>
<p>as the tip of the Asian spear to sort of free,</p>
<p>uh, the Asian people from the colonial Western powers.</p>
<p>Um, you know, and when I was growing up,</p>
<p>we were taught that that was just a, a fig leaf covering,</p>
<p>uh, you know, rampant imperialism,</p>
<p>and certainly some of the Japanese leadership</p>
<p>thought that way, but the more you read,</p>
<p>especially the more modern works,</p>
<p>the more this seems like something a lot of people</p>
<p>really bought into and believed.</p>
<p>Um, could you say that the Japanese</p>
<p>are in a similar position to what that German guy was,</p>
<p>uh, in when, I mean, did they blow it here</p>
<p>by the way they treated the populations</p>
<p>that they liberated?</p>
<p>Could this have gone a different way?</p>
<p>Had they lived up to the hype a little bit</p>
<p>on the marketing message?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, you know, certainly the Japanese</p>
<p>would have done, done themselves a huge favor</p>
<p>if they had just treated the Asian peoples,</p>
<p>uh, that they had conquered, um, more in line</p>
<p>with, uh, with their ideology of this sort of</p>
<p>Pan-Asian liberation movement.</p>
<p>Um, and, and I think that there&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot to be said for that traditional view</p>
<p>that you were taught growing up, which is that the,</p>
<p>the Japanese were, were fundamentally out,</p>
<p>uh, as an imperialist power to try to aggrandize</p>
<p>themselves, their empire, uh, to raise their standard</p>
<p>of living to plunder Asia.</p>
<p>Um, that said, there was this, this kind of messianic</p>
<p>and idealistic strain of, of Japanese imperialism</p>
<p>and certainly among many of those in the regime</p>
<p>who were shaping this, this message.</p>
<p>Uh, there was this idea that, um, uh,</p>
<p>the Europeans have had their way in Asia for long enough</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to, we&rsquo;re the only Asian country</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s strong enough, uh, to put an end to this.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to do that and we&rsquo;re going to,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to, uh, uh, take great sacrifices</p>
<p>in order to do that.</p>
<p>Uh, and I think that there were many Japanese</p>
<p>who genuinely believed that whether or not, uh,</p>
<p>their military forces were able to live up to.</p>
<p>And in fact, that view really persists among,</p>
<p>particularly on the right in Japan today.</p>
<p>Uh, you often hear it said, uh, by right-wing politicians</p>
<p>and, and, uh, writers and historians, uh,</p>
<p>that, uh, Japan&rsquo;s, um, uh, defeat, uh,</p>
<p>in the Pacific war was in a sense,</p>
<p>a kind of long-term sacrifice for the rest of Asia</p>
<p>because it did lead, uh, indirectly and directly</p>
<p>in some cases to the decolonization</p>
<p>of so many of those nations.</p>
<p>Uh, and, um, and, uh, you know, the, the situation</p>
<p>in Asia today where you, you really don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>any European colonies left, uh, in, in Asia.</p>
<p>And that amplification, it probably sped up the process,</p>
<p>certainly throwing out places like France from Indochina</p>
<p>for several years and then having them try</p>
<p>to reestablish themselves definitely changes</p>
<p>the equation.</p>
<p>Um, and, and, you know, and Great Britain was,</p>
<p>was simply exhausted by the war, more of the war in Europe</p>
<p>than the war in the Pacific, but, but because of the war</p>
<p>sort of brought, um, England and, and the UK down</p>
<p>in the world, it became clear within a matter</p>
<p>of about two decades that they no longer had</p>
<p>the economic wherewithal to maintain this empire.</p>
<p>So that indirectly, you could say, uh, led to the,</p>
<p>the independence of places like Malaya.</p>
<p>And those places, of course, were some of the places</p>
<p>that had oil.</p>
<p>And one of the things I think about with this war now</p>
<p>more than I did as a kid, and I think, you know,</p>
<p>having, uh, my life straddles the, the early oil crises era</p>
<p>in the United States in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>And I think Americans, uh, had, had a much better</p>
<p>understanding of things like resources and whatnot</p>
<p>around the world after the oil crisis.</p>
<p>And so when I look back now and I read the stuff</p>
<p>about how the war happened, especially with the embargoes</p>
<p>and everything else, the idea of oil comes into it</p>
<p>so much more than it used to.</p>
<p>Like, I look at the war now and I go,</p>
<p>could this have been classified as the first major global war</p>
<p>for something like oil?</p>
<p>Um, how do you see sort of our, our, our modern,</p>
<p>um, what would we say?</p>
<p>We protect our interests overseas.</p>
<p>We have global supply chains.</p>
<p>We, I mean, in a sense, could we say that you see</p>
<p>the early stages of this in the second world war?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so. I mean, it was, it was clearly</p>
<p>from Japan&rsquo;s point of view, the immediate crisis</p>
<p>that they, that they had to address</p>
<p>that led them to their decision to attack</p>
<p>the United States and Great Britain in December 1941</p>
<p>was this oil problem.</p>
<p>Uh, they had and have, uh, today,</p>
<p>negligible domestic oil production.</p>
<p>So they really had to import, uh, oil both</p>
<p>for their domestic economy and just to run their military,</p>
<p>run their Navy. And so, um, uh, this was sort of</p>
<p>the scenic one on of the entire Japanese imperialist project</p>
<p>is how do you, uh, assure that you have a steady oil supply?</p>
<p>So when we, um, embargoed, uh, oil exports to Japan,</p>
<p>uh, essentially we, we, we started a clock ticking.</p>
<p>They had stockpiled a certain amount of oil,</p>
<p>um, and, uh, and perhaps enough for about a year, uh,</p>
<p>to run both their domestic economy</p>
<p>and their military operations.</p>
<p>And they had to solve that problem either by coming</p>
<p>to some sort of a diplomatic settlement with us,</p>
<p>uh, or if not, by going and getting their own oil,</p>
<p>uh, which is what they did by, uh, taking</p>
<p>the East Indies, Borneo and Sumatra.</p>
<p>And so, um, the, the immediate cause</p>
<p>of the decision to attack Pearl Harbor, uh,</p>
<p>was this, this need to solve this oil problem.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, oil was, was definitely at the very heart</p>
<p>of this conflict from the beginning.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s funny, because if I look at the two circumstances,</p>
<p>Europe versus the Asia Pacific area,</p>
<p>in Europe, the criticism of the Western powers</p>
<p>was that there was an appeasement of Hitler,</p>
<p>and he wasn&rsquo;t confronted strongly enough,</p>
<p>and hence, you get a war. What did Churchill say?</p>
<p>He called it the unnecessary war, right?</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t have to happen. The funny thing is, though,</p>
<p>is maybe you could make a case that in the Asia Pacific theater,</p>
<p>Roosevelt did exactly what the people</p>
<p>who want to confront these dictators did.</p>
<p>I mean, he didn&rsquo;t appease them, he basically told them,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna change your foreign policy,</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re gonna take your oil away,</p>
<p>and yet, you got war anyway.</p>
<p>What do you think about the United States&rsquo;, um,</p>
<p>you know, because there&rsquo;s always been a lot of controversy</p>
<p>about the way the Secretary of State played these things,</p>
<p>and every&hellip; Was this something that the United States</p>
<p>was kind of hoping would happen?</p>
<p>Or, I mean, because certainly, I think the U.S.</p>
<p>must have had enough politicians who realized</p>
<p>that the Japanese can&rsquo;t easily back down</p>
<p>from their entire foreign policy goals of the last 15 years.</p>
<p>Um, did we stumble into this, or was this sort of manipulated</p>
<p>in a way that turned out the way the U.S. wanted?</p>
<p>You know, I mean, you know, it&rsquo;s a controversial question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s gotten a lot of attention.</p>
<p>I tend to think that we stumbled into it</p>
<p>more than we intended for this to happen.</p>
<p>That said, it was clear, uh, in the weeks before,</p>
<p>leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor,</p>
<p>it was clear to our leaders that the Japanese were preparing</p>
<p>to make some sort of a move, uh, in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Um, we did not anticipate the&hellip; raid on Pearl Harbor,</p>
<p>despite all of the many conspiracy theories</p>
<p>that have been spun in that respect.</p>
<p>And yet, we did expect war to begin,</p>
<p>perhaps on that same day, December 7th.</p>
<p>War warnings had gone out.</p>
<p>Um, and I think what&rsquo;s clear is that we had, by that time,</p>
<p>uh, we&rsquo;d been reading the diplomatic mail.</p>
<p>This is a really important achievement</p>
<p>of our, um, cryptanalyst program,</p>
<p>is that we were able to essentially break the codes</p>
<p>that the Japanese, uh, foreign ministry used</p>
<p>to communicate with its embassies overseas.</p>
<p>We continued to read that mail right through the end</p>
<p>of the Second World War.</p>
<p>And so, we, uh, we knew that, um,</p>
<p>that they were essentially preparing, uh,</p>
<p>some sort of a military, uh, move</p>
<p>to try to solve their oil problem.</p>
<p>And, um, uh, you know, I-I think it&rsquo;s clear</p>
<p>that-that, uh, Roosevelt was okay with that.</p>
<p>Roosevelt and-and his, um, his-his cabinet,</p>
<p>uh, understood that the Japanese were likely</p>
<p>to, uh, break off negotiations and-and attack</p>
<p>probably the British and the Dutch,</p>
<p>but not us directly, and that, uh, that might,</p>
<p>uh, lead us to, you know, to-to-to solve</p>
<p>the political problem which-which FDR had at home,</p>
<p>which was that he simply didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the American people united behind this prospect</p>
<p>of joining the Second World War.</p>
<p>Something that he saw by that time</p>
<p>was going to be necessary.</p>
<p>And so, uh, I-I think it&rsquo;s-it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>it was a-it was a story of-of-of stumbling a bit</p>
<p>in terms of the way that the embargo,</p>
<p>the-the various measures were taken throughout 1941.</p>
<p>There are several instances in-in which it-it was not clear</p>
<p>that, uh, that the specific steps that were taken,</p>
<p>uh, to ratchet up these-these economic measures,</p>
<p>uh, were completely in line with the way FDR wanted them</p>
<p>to occur, and yet, um, overall, it, you know,</p>
<p>we had, um, we had-had, uh, regarded Japanese aggression</p>
<p>in Asia as a fundamental, uh, threat to the global peace,</p>
<p>and, uh, and it&rsquo;s essentially wrong in itself,</p>
<p>and FDR&rsquo;s rhetoric had been crystal clear about that,</p>
<p>uh, that this kind of aggression against other nations</p>
<p>was-was dangerous, uh, and it was a contagion,</p>
<p>uh, which had to be-had to be stopped.</p>
<p>And so, um, certainly, we were not going to continue</p>
<p>to export oil from West Texas, uh, to Japan</p>
<p>to allow them to carry on this-this war of aggression</p>
<p>against their neighbors, and if, uh, if that was going</p>
<p>to lead to an outbreak of war in the Pacific,</p>
<p>then so be it. I think our leaders were ready for that.</p>
<p>So then that makes me wonder about the other side&rsquo;s ability,</p>
<p>then, to respond or be flexible.</p>
<p>Um, I-I think this is maybe why everyone spends so much time</p>
<p>diagramming the way the Japanese government is set up,</p>
<p>to show you the dysfunction in it, or the, you know,</p>
<p>the-the-the period right before the Second World War</p>
<p>in the 20s and 30s was sometimes referred to</p>
<p>as a government by assassination,</p>
<p>where you have these-these lower-level officer types</p>
<p>having an outsized influence on overall policy.</p>
<p>And it seems like, in a sense, I mean, I-I was always moved</p>
<p>by the fact that a bunch of the Japanese leaders</p>
<p>at the end of the Second World War who are running the country</p>
<p>have bullets still in their body, you know,</p>
<p>from assassination attempts.</p>
<p>So-so you get this sense of how much leeway</p>
<p>did any of these particular leaders or-or-or influential</p>
<p>people in the Japanese, uh, um, uh, governmental system,</p>
<p>because, you know, they have those higher-up,</p>
<p>sort of the elder statesmen types, too.</p>
<p>Um, how much did that government have the ability?</p>
<p>I-I just feel like they were almost paralyzed sometimes,</p>
<p>uh, in terms of their ability to break this logjam</p>
<p>that whether it was the army or radical politicians</p>
<p>or whatever, I mean, it&rsquo;s almost like they got pulled</p>
<p>to the extremes and no one had the ability</p>
<p>to do anything about that.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, absolutely. I-I wouldn&rsquo;t say it was almost,</p>
<p>they were almost paralyzed.</p>
<p>I would say that it was a paralytic form of government.</p>
<p>The Meiji Constitution, which was the-the form of government</p>
<p>that, uh, Hirohito&rsquo;s grandfather had essentially given</p>
<p>to the Japanese people as a gift,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the way it was presented, um, was a-a document</p>
<p>which reserved quite a bit of power for the emperor,</p>
<p>particularly to command the armed forces directly.</p>
<p>And yet it was, uh, it was ambiguous in many ways.</p>
<p>And, uh, what had happened really was that after Meiji died,</p>
<p>his successors, including Hirohito,</p>
<p>were not strong enough personalities to continue</p>
<p>to assert, uh, the considerable power that-that-that they had,</p>
<p>uh, over the state and over the military in particular</p>
<p>under that-that document.</p>
<p>And through a series of legal precedents,</p>
<p>um, it had, uh, the system that had evolved by the 1930s</p>
<p>essentially put the-the, um, emperor in a very constrained role</p>
<p>where in particular, if his advisors,</p>
<p>his military advisors and his cabinet</p>
<p>presented him with, uh, um, a consensus recommendation,</p>
<p>he essentially was required, uh, to approve of that.</p>
<p>And so, uh, the military, which had really taken control</p>
<p>of the government, every aspect of the government,</p>
<p>not just foreign policy, but domestic policy as well,</p>
<p>um, the army and the navy who were constantly</p>
<p>at each other&rsquo;s throats in a struggle for power,</p>
<p>for control of resources, for control of-of directing</p>
<p>the foreign policy of the country,</p>
<p>um, they realized that as long as they could come</p>
<p>to some kind of rough and ready consensus,</p>
<p>that Hirohito would simply have to rubber stamp</p>
<p>whatever they wanted to do.</p>
<p>And, um, and-and this became a-a more and more costly feature</p>
<p>of the Japanese regime as the crisis approached in 1941</p>
<p>until finally, uh, it became&hellip;</p>
<p>It became necessary for, uh, the military leadership</p>
<p>to-to go ahead with this war that many of them</p>
<p>really didn&rsquo;t believe in, particularly in the navy,</p>
<p>because the alternative was going to be</p>
<p>a complete breakdown of this sort of fragile,</p>
<p>uh, consensus balance that had kept Japan</p>
<p>from descending into a civil war.</p>
<p>And so, yes, violence, political violence, assassinations,</p>
<p>uh, that was always, uh, right beneath the surface.</p>
<p>It-it, you know, it was at its height in the 1930s,</p>
<p>a period where you just had, you know,</p>
<p>one assassination after another,</p>
<p>one act of violence and intimidation</p>
<p>coming up from the middle ranks of the army in particular,</p>
<p>uh, aimed at the leadership.</p>
<p>Uh, and then that settled down in&hellip;</p>
<p>during the war itself, and-and General Tojo</p>
<p>was given much of the credit for having essentially,</p>
<p>sort of, imposed this-this fragile peace</p>
<p>in-in this nascent civil war in Japan.</p>
<p>And then, as the-as the end of the war approached</p>
<p>and the decision, the Japanese confronted the necessity</p>
<p>to essentially face up to their own defeat,</p>
<p>the threat of assassinations, of-of, uh,</p>
<p>civil disorder, of violence,</p>
<p>once again, that became a primary concern.</p>
<p>And so, uh, really, in the-the complex series of events</p>
<p>that finally led to the Japanese decision to surrender</p>
<p>after we had dropped two atomic bombs,</p>
<p>um, was&hellip; occurred against this backdrop of, as you say,</p>
<p>this kind of constant, uh, threat of violence</p>
<p>from&hellip; and-and&hellip; of military insurgency,</p>
<p>which could lead to a coup d&rsquo;etat,</p>
<p>which in turn would lead to the destruction of Japan,</p>
<p>because it would make it impossible</p>
<p>for Japan to surrender.</p>
<p>And so, yes, it was a real mess.</p>
<p>Uh, this-this entire regime, uh, was essentially</p>
<p>entirely dysfunctional.</p>
<p>Uh, the dysfunction of the regime</p>
<p>explains both the decision, uh, to go to war,</p>
<p>to-to launch themselves into a war</p>
<p>that many of their leaders, even before the attack</p>
<p>on Pearl Harbor, recognized that they could not win,</p>
<p>and it also explained the long delay</p>
<p>in acknowledging, uh, Ja-Japan&rsquo;s defeat,</p>
<p>which their military leaders understood perfectly well.</p>
<p>Even a year before the surrender,</p>
<p>they understood that they were defeated</p>
<p>and that, essentially, surrender</p>
<p>or some sort of negotiated settlement,</p>
<p>if they could get it, which would have been</p>
<p>to surrender, that that was inevitable</p>
<p>and the only&hellip; the only possible future for Japan.</p>
<p>You know, when you get to 1945, and you see,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d mentioned how crazy it is by then,</p>
<p>it always strikes me that as we&hellip;</p>
<p>because we still have these debates today</p>
<p>about, uh, dropping of atomic bombs</p>
<p>or-or fire bombings or-or&hellip; or strategic bombing at all.</p>
<p>Um, and-and how difficult it is from our position,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s-it&rsquo;s a stereotype, almost a trope,</p>
<p>but how difficult it is from our position now</p>
<p>in cold blood to try to assess the madness that&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and-and the destructive, um, uh, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a building of it, right?</p>
<p>When you look at the bombing in 1939</p>
<p>versus the 1945 version of it, I mean,</p>
<p>you almost have to build up to something like that.</p>
<p>And then when you try to assess it 70 or 80 years later,</p>
<p>it looks relatively insane, right?</p>
<p>It looks like the-the analog version of the nuclear war</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s so&hellip; that we&rsquo;re so scared about now.</p>
<p>How do you explain to people, and, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re an expert at this, you do this,</p>
<p>how do you explain to people in cold blood today,</p>
<p>um, the hot blood decisions to do things</p>
<p>like firebombing Tokyo in a way that makes sense to them?</p>
<p>How do you take them into a crazy world?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I-I think that, you know,</p>
<p>I agree with you about that.</p>
<p>I-I think that the only way you really can do it</p>
<p>is by telling the entire story of the conflict</p>
<p>from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Uh, that&rsquo;s the only way it makes sense.</p>
<p>The only way the firebombing of Tokyo</p>
<p>or the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</p>
<p>makes sense to me is if I go back to, um, uh,</p>
<p>the Chinese, uh, the Japanese invasion of China in 1937,</p>
<p>the extraordinarily, uh, awful, uh, massacres that went on,</p>
<p>um, the-the barbarism of-of the Japanese army,</p>
<p>the way it, uh, behaved toward, uh, civilians</p>
<p>in the areas that it occupied, uh,</p>
<p>its behavior toward prisoners of war,</p>
<p>including our prisoners of war.</p>
<p>Uh, and you really have to tell the whole story.</p>
<p>Uh, you have to tell the story of how there was this</p>
<p>no-surrender ethic, uh, which had been inculcated</p>
<p>into the Japanese military.</p>
<p>And the way that they really observed that,</p>
<p>uh, on one island after another,</p>
<p>essentially, uh, dying to the last man,</p>
<p>uh, refusing to surrender.</p>
<p>Uh, the way, uh, places like Saipan, uh, the, um,</p>
<p>you had mass suicides of-of Japanese civilians,</p>
<p>uh, rather than falling into the hands of Americans</p>
<p>who were, I think, in good faith,</p>
<p>trying to save their lives.</p>
<p>Um, and-and when you saw this cult of death occurring,</p>
<p>uh, then it became much easier to think in terms of,</p>
<p>well, you know, the Japanese are essentially behaving,</p>
<p>their-both their rhetoric and their behavior indicates</p>
<p>that what they&rsquo;re saying is we&rsquo;re gonna have to kill</p>
<p>all of them in order to end this war.</p>
<p>Uh, literally, every last man, woman, and child of Japan.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to do that, um, but inevitably,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have to kill a lot of Japanese</p>
<p>until, uh, they come to their senses.</p>
<p>And, um, uh, so, you know, you really, uh,</p>
<p>had this kind of inversion of-of what I would say</p>
<p>were, uh, traditional understanding</p>
<p>of-of military ethics, to the point where the-the most</p>
<p>important thing was to try to end the war quickly,</p>
<p>uh, by any means necessary, including, um,</p>
<p>the trespassing upon those traditional ideas</p>
<p>of, uh, separating the-the, um, uh, civilian</p>
<p>from the military target.</p>
<p>And, uh, and that occurred in-in, uh, in Germany as well,</p>
<p>uh, by the way.</p>
<p>And so, uh, again, I-I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s-it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>to sort of sit down with someone who doesn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>the history and to lay it out, uh, without going back</p>
<p>and really telling the entire story.</p>
<p>And so, um, that&rsquo;s-that&rsquo;s what I set out to do</p>
<p>in this, uh, three-volume history,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think that the story can be told</p>
<p>in any less than, uh, you know, 1,800 pages</p>
<p>that I took to tell it.</p>
<p>Do you think a land invasion of the Home Islands</p>
<p>would have happened?</p>
<p>I do not think, uh, that we would have invaded Japan.</p>
<p>Um, I-I think that it was, uh, perhaps we-we knew</p>
<p>that we needed to have the option,</p>
<p>which is why we placed such enormous preparations,</p>
<p>uh, for Operation Downfall, the invasion first of Kyushu</p>
<p>and then of Honshu.</p>
<p>Um, but the target date for the first stage of that invasion,</p>
<p>the invasion of Kyushu, Operation Olympic,</p>
<p>uh, was November 1st, 1945.</p>
<p>We dropped the bomb on, uh, Hiroshima</p>
<p>in the first week of August.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s almost three months.</p>
<p>And so, the question really becomes a counterfactual,</p>
<p>what would have happened in those three months?</p>
<p>And, um, and I think for all we know</p>
<p>about, uh, what was happening in Tokyo,</p>
<p>uh, I think it&rsquo;s very difficult to-to imagine</p>
<p>that the government would have, uh, continued to-to want to fight</p>
<p>that this-this struggle that they were-that they were undertaking</p>
<p>to try to surrender, um, that-that would not have succeeded</p>
<p>in those three months.</p>
<p>Uh, particularly when you consider that the-the conventional bombing campaign</p>
<p>was really growing by leaps and bounds,</p>
<p>uh, really week by week.</p>
<p>And so, even in the absence of the atomic bombs,</p>
<p>um, uh, I-I think it&rsquo;s very unlikely</p>
<p>that we would have launched an invasion of Japan.</p>
<p>You know, we dance around these issues,</p>
<p>I think, when we talk about it,</p>
<p>about how really different the Japanese are,</p>
<p>and how unique in so many ways.</p>
<p>I mean, it makes me wonder about the challenges</p>
<p>of historians who aren&rsquo;t Japanese trying to, you know,</p>
<p>like, I-I would read, uh, there are some wonderful books</p>
<p>we used for the show, uh, written about Japan,</p>
<p>but many of them by Western experts.</p>
<p>And I-I think to myself, um, not only that-that maybe</p>
<p>you might have to be Japanese to understand some of this stuff,</p>
<p>but that maybe even the modern-day Japanese</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t in a position to assess this,</p>
<p>because it was so different, even in that country,</p>
<p>70 or 80 years ago, from, I mean, it&rsquo;s a transformed society.</p>
<p>Um, is it becoming, you know, I used to think when I was younger</p>
<p>that-that, because you would meet people who were veterans in the war,</p>
<p>and people who had been there, they seemed like flesh and blood.</p>
<p>As I get older, they-they almost seem like trying to assess</p>
<p>Alexander the Great, or the Mongols, or, I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s getting to be a society that&rsquo;s in the past.</p>
<p>Does that make sense when we write about this?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to get into the minds of people</p>
<p>who aren&rsquo;t around anymore, and a sort of a societal ethic.</p>
<p>I mean, there are no more Hiroo Onoda&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>or-or-or Kamikaze pilots in Japan.</p>
<p>I mean, is this a&hellip;</p>
<p>This goes back maybe to why people deal with the opening</p>
<p>in the 19th century so much, or when I was growing up,</p>
<p>they used to talk about the Japanese being a-a medieval society</p>
<p>that had been brought into the modern world.</p>
<p>But they almost seem culturally like an extreme manifestation</p>
<p>of humanity by the Second World War.</p>
<p>Um, how does the fact that the Japanese are so different</p>
<p>play into all this? I mean, I know my stepfather</p>
<p>was overwhelmed by the Kamikaze phil-uh-uh-uh phenomenon</p>
<p>when he was in the war.</p>
<p>Um, how much does that play a role in this?</p>
<p>They just seem like the most unusual&hellip; people.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s an open-ended question,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sure you know what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fascination about the Japanese in this war</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re singular, aren&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, they&hellip; It&rsquo;s-it&rsquo;s really true,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, um, putting yourself into the mindset</p>
<p>of-of the Japanese in&hellip; during-during this war</p>
<p>has been a tremendous challenge for everyone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s written about it. Um, and I think there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>to what you say. I mean, the, you know, Japanese of 2021</p>
<p>trying to understand the Japanese of 1941,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s-it&rsquo;s not easy.</p>
<p>There also have been very powerful taboos</p>
<p>which still exist in Japan that kind of govern</p>
<p>the way people think about, talk about,</p>
<p>write about the war.</p>
<p>Um, that said, there has been, uh, quite a-quite a burst</p>
<p>of-of scholarship both by Western scholars of Japan</p>
<p>and by Japanese scholars, which has appeared</p>
<p>in English translation in the past 25 years.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a lot more to be done, actually.</p>
<p>If you look across all of World War II,</p>
<p>across, uh, the whole-the whole global landscape,</p>
<p>um, I think a lot of the most interesting scholarship</p>
<p>of the next, uh, several decades is gonna be</p>
<p>in-in trying to get a better understanding</p>
<p>of what precisely happened in Japan, uh, in those years.</p>
<p>And, um, uh, just to get even more futuristic on you,</p>
<p>I think, you know, machine learning, AI, um,</p>
<p>which is eventually going to eliminate</p>
<p>language barriers in archives.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s gonna be a tremendous, um, improvement</p>
<p>in our understanding collectively</p>
<p>of what happened there, uh, as those new-new tools</p>
<p>start to-start to-start to bear on the issue</p>
<p>over the next few decades.</p>
<p>Um, but, uh, you know, again, it-it really comes down</p>
<p>to kind of understanding this conflict</p>
<p>in the way that our ancestors who fought it understood-</p>
<p>understood it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s-that&rsquo;s where there&rsquo;s a strong case</p>
<p>to be made for narrative history.</p>
<p>Something that I do, something that you do as well</p>
<p>as a podcaster, trying to go back and-and help, um,</p>
<p>people understand what were-what was in the minds</p>
<p>of those who were there at the time,</p>
<p>making the decisions, fighting these battles.</p>
<p>Um, the, you know, from the-the guys in the-in the trenches,</p>
<p>on the decks of the ships, in the cockpits,</p>
<p>to those who are-are in the, uh, headquarters,</p>
<p>uh, making decisions, uh, from a military standpoint,</p>
<p>to the halls of power in Washington and-and Tokyo.</p>
<p>Understanding this entire conflict,</p>
<p>the way it unfolded week by week, uh, I think is-is the-</p>
<p>really the best way to try to get closer</p>
<p>to the way, uh, that it was understood by-by those</p>
<p>who were there.</p>
<p>There are parts, too, that fade into the background</p>
<p>until you start reading about them, and you go,</p>
<p>oh, really? This is hard to relate to.</p>
<p>For example, uh, and you touched upon it</p>
<p>with the Japanese, but I&rsquo;m fascinated</p>
<p>with the American version of it, too,</p>
<p>the inter-service rivalries.</p>
<p>And-and because I think these days,</p>
<p>at least the general consensus among civilians</p>
<p>is that, oh, the services work well together</p>
<p>in the United States and whatnot.</p>
<p>To-to truly understand, I mean, I was reading, um,</p>
<p>I was reading one book, and they were talking about,</p>
<p>uh, it was a scene, uh, on Guadalcanal, I think it was,</p>
<p>and there was a-it was an army officer</p>
<p>who was berating a Marine,</p>
<p>and there was another Marine in the distance</p>
<p>who cocked his rifle or something.</p>
<p>It was-it was portrayed as a scene</p>
<p>where this Marine was gonna frag this army officer</p>
<p>for yelling at another Marine.</p>
<p>Um, the Japanese inter-service rivalry</p>
<p>literally decided, you know, the direction</p>
<p>the war would take often, but-but people don&rsquo;t realize,</p>
<p>and-and this includes yours, truly.</p>
<p>You know, I remembered it, but I really didn&rsquo;t remember it</p>
<p>until you started diving into Douglas MacArthur&rsquo;s, uh,</p>
<p>paranoid fantasies about the Navy and all this stuff.</p>
<p>Can you talk a little about the inter-service rivalry</p>
<p>and how it determined kind of the way things went?</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, you know, our military, um, before,</p>
<p>and a-a lot of people don&rsquo;t know this,</p>
<p>including a lot of people who&rsquo;ve read a lot</p>
<p>about World War II, um, we did not have</p>
<p>a Joint Chiefs of Staff organization</p>
<p>prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>Uh, there was a, uh, board,</p>
<p>which was sort of a liaison organization,</p>
<p>uh, of generals and admirals</p>
<p>who kind of loosely coordinated their planning.</p>
<p>Uh, but there was really no, um, sustained attempt</p>
<p>to blend the operations of the Army, the Navy,</p>
<p>uh, and what was emerging as these two other services</p>
<p>under the umbrella of the Army and Navy,</p>
<p>the Army Air Forces, uh,</p>
<p>and in the case of the Navy, the Marines,</p>
<p>um, both sort of emerging</p>
<p>as increasingly independent organizations</p>
<p>within the Army and, uh, the, uh, War and Navy departments.</p>
<p>And so really, we-we had, um, we had a very sort of</p>
<p>decentralized, um, poorly coordinated military</p>
<p>prior to the war.</p>
<p>And it was really only under the pressure</p>
<p>of the emergency of the attack on Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>And then the first, uh, British, uh, summit,</p>
<p>uh, which occurred literally just weeks after Pearl Harbor</p>
<p>when the, uh, Churchill and his, um, military, uh, uh,</p>
<p>Chiefs came to Washington to sort of begin</p>
<p>to plan how we were going to deal with this crisis.</p>
<p>And it was only under that pressure that our, uh, Chiefs,</p>
<p>our Chief of Naval Operations</p>
<p>and our Army Chief of Staff, George Marshall,</p>
<p>uh, got together and said,</p>
<p>listen, we-we&rsquo;ve got to have some sort of way</p>
<p>of organizing ourselves,</p>
<p>so why don&rsquo;t we just start meeting?</p>
<p>And they called themselves the Joint Chiefs.</p>
<p>All of that was ad hoc.</p>
<p>Uh, there was no legislative charter.</p>
<p>And, um, and essentially, they just, uh, ran the war</p>
<p>as this sort of informal committee.</p>
<p>And the Joint Chiefs of Staff organization</p>
<p>was not formally codified in our laws until, uh, 1947</p>
<p>with the National Security Act.</p>
<p>It created the-the structure that exists today</p>
<p>at the Pentagon.</p>
<p>And so all of that is just a long-winded way of saying,</p>
<p>uh, that our military really was not prepared to fight,</p>
<p>uh, a global war which would require</p>
<p>these different services to work together</p>
<p>in sustained and intricate cooperation.</p>
<p>They had to figure that out, uh,</p>
<p>on essentially week by week</p>
<p>as they were dealing with this military emergency.</p>
<p>In the Pacific, uh, the problem was even greater</p>
<p>than it was in-in Europe.</p>
<p>Certainly was an issue in Europe as well.</p>
<p>But in the Pacific, you had, uh, as I said earlier,</p>
<p>looking at a map of the Pacific, you-you quickly grasped</p>
<p>that the fundamental strategic problem</p>
<p>is how do you deal with a rampaging Japanese fleet?</p>
<p>You have to destroy Japanese naval power</p>
<p>before you can project your military forces</p>
<p>across the Pacific in a way that will force Japan to surrender.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a job for your navy</p>
<p>and also your air forces.</p>
<p>Your air forces, of course, you have naval and army air forces.</p>
<p>They have to work together.</p>
<p>And then you have to take, uh, islands, uh, to&hellip;</p>
<p>as naval bases, as air bases, uh,</p>
<p>and to support the logistics drive across the Pacific.</p>
<p>And to take islands, you essentially have to develop</p>
<p>this-this, uh, particularly specialized, um,</p>
<p>branch of warfare called amphibious warfare,</p>
<p>uh, which the Marines had really focused on.</p>
<p>And-and they were the organization</p>
<p>that was best prepared, had done the most training,</p>
<p>had developed the equipment, uh, for-for, um,</p>
<p>storming even heavily defended beaches</p>
<p>that were in some cases thousands of miles away</p>
<p>from any, uh, allied base.</p>
<p>And so, uh, the very nature of the Pacific War</p>
<p>was that you had to, uh, force these services,</p>
<p>which were not prepared to work together,</p>
<p>to work together.</p>
<p>And in-in doing so, of course, uh, that would expose</p>
<p>all of the frictions, the prejudices, the biases,</p>
<p>the parochialism, uh, that, um, was natural</p>
<p>among military leaders who had grown up</p>
<p>in these very siloed kinds of organizations.</p>
<p>And then overlaid on top of that,</p>
<p>just to make the whole thing even more complex,</p>
<p>uh, you had in Douglas MacArthur,</p>
<p>a sort of a singular figure,</p>
<p>really no one else like him in the American military,</p>
<p>in any branch of the American military,</p>
<p>someone who became very, very famous very quickly,</p>
<p>uh, literally just in the week,</p>
<p>the two weeks after Pearl Harbor had skyrocketed</p>
<p>to this kind of position of, um, being regarded</p>
<p>almost as a kind of demigod by the American people</p>
<p>because of the-the lavish press coverage</p>
<p>that his campaign in the Pacific had received.</p>
<p>And he was a, I think fair to say,</p>
<p>a kind of narcissistic figure, uh,</p>
<p>who really wanted to place himself</p>
<p>at the center of this conflict</p>
<p>against Japan, uh, was jealous of others</p>
<p>who would receive attention and who, uh, you know,</p>
<p>very aggressively was willing to use his fame</p>
<p>as political influence, uh, in order to try</p>
<p>to force the war, uh, to be fought</p>
<p>according to the ideas that-that he had,</p>
<p>uh, on how it should be fought,</p>
<p>which really meant returning to the Philippines first.</p>
<p>Uh, and, uh, and-and es-essentially,</p>
<p>in order to accommodate, uh, MacArthur&rsquo;s, uh,</p>
<p>immense personality, uh, the way the war was set up</p>
<p>was we divided the Pacific into two separate theaters.</p>
<p>And you had MacArthur in Australia,</p>
<p>the command in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>Then you had the Navy with Nimitz</p>
<p>as commander-in-chief in Hawaii, uh,</p>
<p>and his realm included essentially everything</p>
<p>north of the equator.</p>
<p>Uh, and these two guys, uh, both reported</p>
<p>to the Joint Chiefs in Washington.</p>
<p>And, um, and-and they could talk to each other informally,</p>
<p>uh, but any conflict between them</p>
<p>would have to be resolved in Washington.</p>
<p>And so you had that element laid atop, uh,</p>
<p>what was already a pretty messy situation</p>
<p>in the way that the services had to-to work together.</p>
<p>And so w-when you-when you look at all of those issues,</p>
<p>all of those problems, uh, all of-all of those-those frictions,</p>
<p>those inherent frictions, um, it&rsquo;s remarkable, I think,</p>
<p>that our military was able to-to kind of get itself together,</p>
<p>uh, and win this war in less than four years.</p>
<p>Well, and you think about, I mean, you-you talked</p>
<p>about MacArthur almost being a demigod,</p>
<p>but I feel like it&rsquo;s a pa- You know, when you look</p>
<p>at all of the-the august military figures</p>
<p>from that day, it&rsquo;s like a giant cast of stars</p>
<p>with MacArthur maybe as the-as the superstar.</p>
<p>But I think about how overwhelming these people were</p>
<p>in terms of force of personality and-and the depth</p>
<p>of their experience, that when some guy like FDR,</p>
<p>who has been the ringmaster, sort of,</p>
<p>who-who for so many years is able to juggle</p>
<p>all these enormous personalities and work them against each other</p>
<p>and charm them all, when he leaves the scene</p>
<p>because he dies in office, and leaves it to a guy</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been vice president for about two seconds,</p>
<p>and who doesn&rsquo;t necessarily, uh, remind one</p>
<p>of some august, super strong personality,</p>
<p>and you throw him into a room where he&rsquo;s gotta make decisions</p>
<p>between these people who may be of different opinions</p>
<p>on things, right? Um, it makes me wonder</p>
<p>how different the war would&rsquo;ve gone</p>
<p>had FDR managed to-to ride it out health-wise until the end.</p>
<p>Uh, how much does a green Harry Truman change things,</p>
<p>or does it just sort of run on autopilot, do you think?</p>
<p>Um, because of the, you know, you got-you&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to over-overwhelm a MacArthur, who FDR once called,</p>
<p>as you know, uh, one of the two most dangerous men</p>
<p>in the world, along with Huey Long.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna o-you&rsquo;re not gonna overwhelm him.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, we-as we know,</p>
<p>that-that will come to a head in the next war in Korea,</p>
<p>where Harry Truman and Douglas MacArthur will bump heads.</p>
<p>But, I mean, it d-does it run on autopilot,</p>
<p>or do you think Truman put his-his stamp</p>
<p>on the way the war finished up at all?</p>
<p>Well, I think the-the war in Europe was-was virtually done.</p>
<p>Um, FDR died, I think, almost exactly a year before,</p>
<p>um, victory in Europe Day, V-E Day.</p>
<p>Um, and so, uh, I would say that, um,</p>
<p>the situation in Europe, at least the war in Europe,</p>
<p>uh, was on autopilot.</p>
<p>The negotiations with Stalin in particular</p>
<p>were not, uh, and so, um, Truman definitely had to step</p>
<p>into some very large shoes there quickly.</p>
<p>The war in-in, um, the Pacific,</p>
<p>there is a lot of counterfactual speculation</p>
<p>that you can do in the scenario where FDR lived.</p>
<p>Um, y-you know, so much of-of our government&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>um, uh, thinking about how to end the war in the Pacific</p>
<p>turned on this idea of, you know,</p>
<p>you know, what is, um, this unconditional surrender</p>
<p>formulation require of us?</p>
<p>FDR had set this thing out.</p>
<p>He had, it was a very personal decision that he made</p>
<p>to make unconditional surrender, uh, the, um,</p>
<p>the, essentially, the asking price, uh, for peace.</p>
<p>And, uh, you know, he had gone back to-to an inaccurate anecdote</p>
<p>about how the American Civil War had ended.</p>
<p>Um, but clearly, what he had in mind</p>
<p>was avoiding a reprise of the end of the First World War in Europe,</p>
<p>in which the seeds of-of the Second World War had been planted</p>
<p>and the rise of Nazism after, uh, the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
<p>And so, he-he wanted to-to be sure that Germany and Japan</p>
<p>were defeated utterly and-and critically</p>
<p>that the people of those countries understand,</p>
<p>understood that they had been defeated utterly.</p>
<p>And so, he had insisted upon this unconditional surrender formulation.</p>
<p>And then he dies, and-and our-our leaders are kind of left</p>
<p>with this question of, well, we have to-we have to do justice</p>
<p>to-to what our-our dead chief, uh, wanted.</p>
<p>Uh, and for our own credibility,</p>
<p>we have to insist upon unconditional surrender.</p>
<p>But what does that mean, exactly? Unconditional surrender.</p>
<p>It seems simple, but when you start to spin out</p>
<p>all the possible permutations of how a surrender might occur,</p>
<p>uh, it raises, uh, more questions than it answers.</p>
<p>And so, uh, Truman steps into this situation in which we,</p>
<p>you know, we do not have a very clear idea of-of what we expect</p>
<p>from the Japanese in terms of how this surrender will occur.</p>
<p>We do not want to invade those islands.</p>
<p>Uh, we have this new weapon, the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>Uh, Truman, by the way, had not been briefed</p>
<p>on the existence of the atomic bomb,</p>
<p>which seems like an extraordinary oversight.</p>
<p>Um, considering that FDR was in failing health,</p>
<p>his doctors knew he was in failing health.</p>
<p>Uh, and-and yet, uh, Truman was simply not prepared.</p>
<p>He had not been properly briefed.</p>
<p>Uh, and it-it seems like really an extraordinary failure</p>
<p>of, um, just the principles of constitutional government.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that I think FDR has to&hellip;</p>
<p>His-his legacy has to-has to be charged, uh, with that failure.</p>
<p>Um, but, uh, you know, so-so the counterfactual questions are,</p>
<p>you know, would we have used the atomic bombs</p>
<p>in the way that we use them?</p>
<p>Uh, you know, so-so often the-the question of the atomic bombs</p>
<p>is kind of reduced to a binary.</p>
<p>Should we or shouldn&rsquo;t we have used them?</p>
<p>I think the harder question is,</p>
<p>should we have used them in the way that we use them?</p>
<p>In particular, should we have dropped them</p>
<p>without any sort of explicit prior warning?</p>
<p>And should we have dropped them on cities</p>
<p>rather than on a military base, at least the first one?</p>
<p>And, um, and-and it&rsquo;s, you know, you-one can only speculate,</p>
<p>really, because there is so little that FDR said.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so little in the-in the historical record</p>
<p>indicating what his thinking was,</p>
<p>particularly about the use of these weapons.</p>
<p>Um, and yet, uh, I think it&rsquo;s clear that he would have seen them</p>
<p>as a weapon that should be used</p>
<p>if there was a way to avoid invading Japan.</p>
<p>Um, and yet, uh, would he have consented to drop them on cities</p>
<p>rather than on military targets?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a hard question to ask.</p>
<p>I think certainly you could argue that FDR, uh, would have said,</p>
<p>we dropped the first one on a military target.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the commander-in-chief.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve-I&rsquo;ve said, uh, what we&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not taking any backtalk from any of you guys</p>
<p>with-with, uh, Gold, Braid, and Stars.</p>
<p>Certainly, he-he would not have felt any compunction</p>
<p>about ruling directly on the question in that respect,</p>
<p>uh, in a way that Truman, I don&rsquo;t think, was ready to do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the real counterfactual, I think,</p>
<p>is would we have used the bombs in the way that we used them</p>
<p>if F-FDR had lived?</p>
<p>And, uh, you know, as I said, I-I think it&rsquo;s speculative,</p>
<p>but I think there are some good reasons to believe</p>
<p>that we would not have used them in the way that we used them.</p>
<p>Uh, had, uh, FDR lived through the end of the war.</p>
<p>You know, when you look at the Second World War,</p>
<p>um, you know, you read book- books like Neil Ferguson&rsquo;s works,</p>
<p>for example, and-and you realize what a-what a large role</p>
<p>race played in the whole thing.</p>
<p>So, in-in Europe, you have the whole master race question</p>
<p>involved in-in Nazi ideology.</p>
<p>In Asia, both sides can be called racist</p>
<p>because the Japanese have-have a sort of a master race philosophy.</p>
<p>The Americans and the, uh, and the British and the French</p>
<p>and the Western powers look upon the Japanese</p>
<p>the way they look upon a lot of different non-white peoples.</p>
<p>Um, how much, and-and there&rsquo;ve been a lot of good works</p>
<p>lately about the racial aspect, but-but if we were fighting,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t wanna say fighting Scandinavians,</p>
<p>because basically, everything we did to the Japanese,</p>
<p>we did to the Germans too, in terms of bombing</p>
<p>and everything else, and the atomic bomb was developed</p>
<p>to be dropped on Germany, so, and that&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>But-but how much does, do you think now,</p>
<p>if we had more of the, I-I was gonna say racial,</p>
<p>uh, racial tolerance thinking of the sort we have today,</p>
<p>but some would argue about that, but I think it would be</p>
<p>a different war compared to the 1940s, um, views on race</p>
<p>that weren&rsquo;t just something in the West,</p>
<p>but that most countries had a different view</p>
<p>on, uh, skin color, culture, background, uh, stereotypes,</p>
<p>and all that kinds of stuff. Talk to me a little bit</p>
<p>about the-the race idea in the Pacific Asia theater</p>
<p>in the Second World War.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I mean, you know, clearly, race-race hatred</p>
<p>was-was at the center of the propaganda</p>
<p>of both the, uh, allies and the Japanese.</p>
<p>Um, and, uh, uh, you know, it was partly the way</p>
<p>that the Japanese had-had conducted themselves</p>
<p>during the war, I think, aroused this peculiar race hatred.</p>
<p>Uh, many of those who would engage</p>
<p>in the most awful sorts of rhetoric.</p>
<p>Uh, I mean, I&rsquo;m thinking of a-a parade that occurred</p>
<p>in Fifth Avenue in Manhattan in June 1942,</p>
<p>is the same month as the Battle of Midway.</p>
<p>Uh, and it was essentially a parade to celebrate</p>
<p>the city&rsquo;s, uh, participation, mobilizing for war.</p>
<p>And they had these huge parade floats, uh, which were rats,</p>
<p>uh, and wearing Japanese army uniforms.</p>
<p>Um, and, uh, and you almost have to sort of rub your eyes</p>
<p>when you see these things.</p>
<p>You realize it&rsquo;s not that long ago,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s within living memory, in New York City,</p>
<p>uh, in-in which, really, the most virulent sorts</p>
<p>of, um, metaphors were used.</p>
<p>Um, you know, it was a-it was a different time,</p>
<p>it was a different war.</p>
<p>Uh, many of those who engaged in-in that-that sort of,</p>
<p>uh, you know, racist, uh, rhetoric, uh,</p>
<p>were also genuinely sympathetic to the Chinese,</p>
<p>and saw the Chinese as our allies, and, um,</p>
<p>and-and were moved by the suffering of the Chinese</p>
<p>at the hands of the Japanese.</p>
<p>Um, so, you know, I-I just think I-we&rsquo;re-we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>I-I just think I-one of the under-told stories</p>
<p>just occurring to me now in-in the Pacific</p>
<p>was the role of the Nisei, the Japanese-Americans.</p>
<p>We-we know well that one of the most decorated regiments</p>
<p>in the army was a Japanese-American Hawaiian regiment</p>
<p>that fought in Italy.</p>
<p>Um, but, uh, you had Japanese-Americans</p>
<p>from Hawaii and-and, uh, California</p>
<p>and the West Coast, uh, who were, um, uh,</p>
<p>serving as translators, uh, during these-these battles</p>
<p>in, um, Okinawa and Saipan and the Philippines.</p>
<p>And, uh, there were cases of extraordinary heroism,</p>
<p>uh, on the part of these Americans,</p>
<p>many of whom had their families interned in camps,</p>
<p>uh, back home, who were-would, um, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a-there&rsquo;s a story of a, uh, you know,</p>
<p>one of these guys who&rsquo;s really just-his job</p>
<p>is just to be a translator, but, you know,</p>
<p>he grabs a grenade, he goes, he knocks on the, uh,</p>
<p>hatch of a Japanese tank, he addresses them in Japanese,</p>
<p>telling them that he has a message from the colonel,</p>
<p>they open the hatch, he drops a grenade,</p>
<p>and, um, you had, uh, Japanese-American translators</p>
<p>descending into caves in Okinawa,</p>
<p>negotiating for their surrender face-to-face</p>
<p>with people who could easily kill them,</p>
<p>um, volunteering to do this,</p>
<p>not because they were ordered to do it.</p>
<p>Uh, and-and when you-when you, um,</p>
<p>realized that they were making these kinds of sacrifices,</p>
<p>you realize, um, you know, just how perverse it was,</p>
<p>really, for us to have allowed, uh, our own propaganda,</p>
<p>in many cases, to use the kinds of, um, uh, you know,</p>
<p>really repulsive racial stereotypes</p>
<p>and hateful rhetoric that-that we engaged in.</p>
<p>And, you know, I don&rsquo;t see myself as a prosecutor,</p>
<p>uh, you know, I-I think you have to recognize</p>
<p>that this was a very different time</p>
<p>and very extreme circumstances,</p>
<p>and yet, when you look at that, uh, certainly as an American,</p>
<p>you-you-you sort of wish that we could have done</p>
<p>some of those things differently.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s funny, though, those sorts of backdrops</p>
<p>do allow for, uh, some of the more wonderful</p>
<p>human moments to come out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m-I&rsquo;m reminded there was a,</p>
<p>I think it was in John Tolan&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>there was a-a scene during the-the Bataan Death March,</p>
<p>I think it was, where some Japanese officer,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get it wrong here, but-but sees, like,</p>
<p>a class ring on one of the Americans</p>
<p>from, like, Notre Dame or USC or something,</p>
<p>and walks up and embraces them,</p>
<p>because they were there and said, you know,</p>
<p>-&ldquo;What class were you?&rdquo; I mean, those moments</p>
<p>where, because you&rsquo;re in such a hell,</p>
<p>those-those human&hellip;</p>
<p>those little human connections</p>
<p>seem to stand out so much more.</p>
<p>Um, and-and, you know, I think about,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d mentioned the-the prisoners of war and all that.</p>
<p>One of the things that, when you talked,</p>
<p>and there are very few of them left, I guess,</p>
<p>but when you talked to-to veterans</p>
<p>from the Second World War,</p>
<p>did you ever notice the difference</p>
<p>in the-in the Pacific veterans, um,</p>
<p>remembrances or attitudes after the war,</p>
<p>and-and the ones in the European theater</p>
<p>or in North Africa or in Italy?</p>
<p>Uh, it just seemed like there was a lot more lingering,</p>
<p>uh, bitterness on the Pacific veterans&rsquo; parts,</p>
<p>uh, at least in my experience.</p>
<p>Did you notice that as well?</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, there were many, many, um,</p>
<p>uh, American and-and I-I think also allied British,</p>
<p>Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, uh, troops,</p>
<p>um, who just never were able to-to, uh,</p>
<p>overcome this kind of deeply felt hatred</p>
<p>for all Japanese and for the entire nation,</p>
<p>uh, of the Japanese.</p>
<p>Interestingly, um, there is a-a real difference</p>
<p>in the way that those troops who served</p>
<p>in the occupation in Japan after the war felt.</p>
<p>And-and I don&rsquo;t have any survey data.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, if-if there had been some survey data,</p>
<p>I think it would have borne this out</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s-it&rsquo;s-it was a-a fascinating pattern</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve seen in my interviews with hundreds and hundreds</p>
<p>of World War II veterans.</p>
<p>Those who were in Japan after the war</p>
<p>serving with the occupation,</p>
<p>they tended to have a much more nuanced view</p>
<p>of the Japanese and even very warm feelings,</p>
<p>uh, toward the Japanese.</p>
<p>They grasp very quickly, uh, that the way that, um,</p>
<p>the Japanese army had conducted itself on the battlefield,</p>
<p>uh, and the way that many of our prisoners have been treated</p>
<p>was not a reflection of the Japanese people overall,</p>
<p>but were-those were specific crimes</p>
<p>committed by specific people.</p>
<p>And that, uh, ordinary Japanese people had been,</p>
<p>in a sense, victims of the war as well.</p>
<p>That was a-a realization that came much more, uh,</p>
<p>naturally in my experience,</p>
<p>speaking, again, just to many hundreds of veterans,</p>
<p>uh, for those who-who had been served in Japan</p>
<p>after the war, uh, as opposed to those</p>
<p>who had never really set foot in Japan</p>
<p>and had just come straight home from the war.</p>
<p>Yes, well, so just close contact always has the opportunity</p>
<p>for people to get to know one another</p>
<p>on a human level.</p>
<p>Um, so-so, and I-I won&rsquo;t keep you very much longer,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m curious about, like, how you filter through,</p>
<p>um, the-the Cold War, um, um, um, opaqueness.</p>
<p>So-so, for example, when I was younger,</p>
<p>trying to figure out the role of the emperor in Japan</p>
<p>was always colored by, uh, the needs of the Cold War</p>
<p>and having Japanese cooperation early on.</p>
<p>Um, you know, you had talked also about records</p>
<p>becoming available, and it makes me think</p>
<p>of Chinese records now and-and former Soviet records</p>
<p>that the Russians are releasing.</p>
<p>Um, in-in-in the sense of trying to rewrite the history</p>
<p>of-of the Second World War based on, um, the-the&hellip;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the word I&rsquo;m looking for?</p>
<p>The-the fact that there were, I mean,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s-let&rsquo;s start with Hirohito&rsquo;s role.</p>
<p>Um, Herbert P. Bix wrote a whole book on Hirohito,</p>
<p>and I remember being amazed how much it conflicted</p>
<p>with, uh, the-the Hirohito as a puppet figure</p>
<p>that I had been taught.</p>
<p>Um, what-what is your view on that?</p>
<p>And how do you-how do you work your way as a-as a researcher</p>
<p>through the deliberate, um, uh, story of the Cold War</p>
<p>that maybe tries to hide some of Hirohito&rsquo;s, uh, uh,</p>
<p>ability to influence some of these decisions?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I&hellip; You know, I was a boy in Japan.</p>
<p>Um, Dan, I-I was in Japan from, uh, 1978 to 1981.</p>
<p>I was age 11.</p>
<p>Oh, I had no idea.</p>
<p>I was age 11 through 14.</p>
<p>Um, my father was, uh, working for an international bank</p>
<p>in Japan.</p>
<p>And, uh, Hirohito was the emperor then.</p>
<p>And, uh&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>We would actually go to the, uh&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d go to the Imperial Palace on his birthday.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d see him out there, you know, waving to the crowds.</p>
<p>He was a beloved figure.</p>
<p>We had a-a live-in, uh, housekeeper who, you know,</p>
<p>had a photo of him and who spoke of him as, you know,</p>
<p>almost like a personal father figure.</p>
<p>And so, um, you know, all of that is-is very, sort of,</p>
<p>very, sort of, personal and-and, um, you know,</p>
<p>sort of a visceral understanding of&hellip;</p>
<p>They really had this-this, um&hellip;</p>
<p>He-he was more than a-a king, really.</p>
<p>He was no-no longer a god, uh, and I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>the period when I was there as a boy.</p>
<p>Um, and yet, there were still these deep feelings</p>
<p>of affection that ordinary Japanese had felt toward him.</p>
<p>And so, you know, clearly, um, the Japanese needed, uh&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, it-it was understood that the-the continuation</p>
<p>of the Imperial House after the war was in our interests</p>
<p>in order to ease the occupation.</p>
<p>Um, when, uh, there were calls for Hirohito to be arrested</p>
<p>as a war criminal, potentially prosecuted along with the-the</p>
<p>other Japanese war criminals at the Tokyo war crimes trials,</p>
<p>uh, um, MacArthur, who opposed this, uh, said to Washington,</p>
<p>uh, listen, if you wanna do this, I need at least</p>
<p>800,000 more troops.</p>
<p>Uh&hellip;</p>
<p>And that quickly put an end to this talk of arresting Hirohito.</p>
<p>And so, uh, there were immediate contingent reasons</p>
<p>why it was clearly the right thing to do</p>
<p>in order to ease this occupation,</p>
<p>or at the same time, to kind of get Japan back on its feet</p>
<p>as a bulwark against communism, because very quickly,</p>
<p>as you say, our concern in Asia and throughout the world</p>
<p>shifted toward-toward holding the Soviet Union back,</p>
<p>and then, of course, China after the Civil War there.</p>
<p>Um, and so, for all of those reasons,</p>
<p>it just made sense to keep Hirohito on his throne</p>
<p>and to make him into a partner.</p>
<p>Um, and again, for those same reasons,</p>
<p>it was not in our interest to expose precisely the degree</p>
<p>to which, uh, he really had played an active role,</p>
<p>uh, in, um, uh, commanding his military forces,</p>
<p>uh, at least after the attack on Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>His-his role is-is sort of muddled, it&rsquo;s ambiguous.</p>
<p>He-he resisted the drift toward war,</p>
<p>and then he supported it after it seemed</p>
<p>to go well.</p>
<p>Uh, and so, uh, it was really after his death in 1989</p>
<p>that some of the, uh, documents that exposed this-this greater</p>
<p>role that he had played that Herbert Bix, uh, outlined</p>
<p>in his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, he mentioned,</p>
<p>uh, in particular, the document known as the Soliloquy,</p>
<p>which was, um, uh, essentially a series of notes</p>
<p>taken by Hirohito&rsquo;s private secretary,</p>
<p>in which he had, uh, reminisced about different aspects</p>
<p>of the war, uh, which showed, really, that he had played</p>
<p>this much more active role, um, and, uh, and so, you know,</p>
<p>I-I think it&rsquo;s-it&rsquo;s been a process since 1989</p>
<p>for the Japanese to gradually, um, come to understand,</p>
<p>uh, that their emperor, you know, had not been</p>
<p>the person who was presented to them in the mythology,</p>
<p>um, and that&rsquo;s continuing, and their role</p>
<p>with their imperial house is today very ambiguous.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had an emperor who&rsquo;s actually advocated something</p>
<p>that had not happened before, and so, um,</p>
<p>uh, you know, I-I think that often in the West,</p>
<p>we, you know, we-we tend to say the Japanese</p>
<p>simply haven&rsquo;t faced up to their history.</p>
<p>I think that that-that&rsquo;s still true to a degree,</p>
<p>but-but, um, it-it often misses the fact</p>
<p>that there has been quite a bit of progress in Japan,</p>
<p>uh, in, um, beginning to-to face up to a greater extent,</p>
<p>uh, to the importance of this history, and-and, um,</p>
<p>you know, now that the eyes of the world are on Tokyo</p>
<p>as the Olympics start, um, you know,</p>
<p>I-I just don&rsquo;t see any possibility</p>
<p>that in their opening ceremony, they would go back</p>
<p>and try to explain their history, uh,</p>
<p>at least that part of their history.</p>
<p>Uh, but there may-a day may come when-when the Japanese,</p>
<p>a future generation of Japanese, may be more willing,</p>
<p>uh, to sort of examine in a more public way,</p>
<p>uh, what happened in their period of their dark valley,</p>
<p>the 1930s to the-their defeat in 1945.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a human thing.</p>
<p>I think-I think most countries in the world</p>
<p>have parts of their population that have a hard time</p>
<p>going back and analyzing painful periods</p>
<p>when maybe the best decisions or the best actions weren&rsquo;t made.</p>
<p>Uh, before I let you go, is there anything</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t ask you about that you&rsquo;d like to convey?</p>
<p>The-the-the three-book series is a triumph.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t read it, folks, um, we used it extensively.</p>
<p>You have a wonderful way of finding</p>
<p>the best historical anecdotes to-to pepper the story with</p>
<p>that just really, really gives a great sense of the context.</p>
<p>Is there anything, uh, that I didn&rsquo;t ask you about</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s worth talking about before I let you go?</p>
<p>You know, something I was just thinking of, Mike,</p>
<p>as I was out walking this morning,</p>
<p>um, you often, in-in your podcast,</p>
<p>you often come up with these-these kinds of metaphors</p>
<p>that no historian would have thought of to make up a point.</p>
<p>Well, for their career&rsquo;s sake, probably.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Well, but often they kind of get to the heart of something.</p>
<p>And-and, um, you know, I-I was just thinking</p>
<p>in the Pacific War, we had, um, what I lay out in the book</p>
<p>as being the cumulative versus the sequential strategies.</p>
<p>Cumulative strategy is essentially the campaign</p>
<p>across the Pacific, island by island, battle by battle.</p>
<p>You can diagram it on the map with arrows.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the march across the Pacific toward Japan.</p>
<p>Then you had the, um, what they called the cumulative strategies,</p>
<p>which were like the submarine war against Japanese shipping</p>
<p>or strategic bombing of Japanese industries and cities.</p>
<p>And these are, rather than discrete battles, uh,</p>
<p>these are-are military actions which have this kind</p>
<p>of cumulative effect of undermining the Japanese, uh,</p>
<p>economy, their ability to wage war.</p>
<p>And one of the fascinating questions, sort of higher order</p>
<p>strategic questions in the Pacific was, uh,</p>
<p>how do you allocate your resources to these two different</p>
<p>ways of fighting this war?</p>
<p>Often your field commanders, uh, really are thinking</p>
<p>only of the next battle.</p>
<p>Um, and-and, uh, one of the things that I think</p>
<p>our-our military eventually did right,</p>
<p>although it took us a while to kind of get-get the hang of it,</p>
<p>uh, was to devote much more effort to this cumulative</p>
<p>sort of attack on the-on the, um, the-the cornerstones</p>
<p>of the Japanese economy and war effort.</p>
<p>And-and so that-that question, you know, how do you allocate</p>
<p>resources between those two very different wars</p>
<p>that are happening at the same time?</p>
<p>Uh, a metaphor, uh, I&rsquo;m a baseball fan,</p>
<p>and a metaphor occurred to me, which is, you know,</p>
<p>how do you evaluate a baseball player, uh, who may be</p>
<p>a great hitter and a lousy fielder?</p>
<p>Or another, uh, another, um, player who is a great fielder</p>
<p>and only an average hitter?</p>
<p>So what is the-the value of fielding versus, uh, hitting</p>
<p>in-in baseball?</p>
<p>Now, this is something that for many, many years</p>
<p>in the game of baseball, uh, the managers were not getting right</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t have the data analytics, uh,</p>
<p>to go in and analyze that-that, um, problem in a systematic way</p>
<p>using the data that baseball provides.</p>
<p>And all of that has changed.</p>
<p>Michael Lewis&rsquo;s Moneyball is probably the best account</p>
<p>of-of this revolution in baseball.</p>
<p>We had a bunch of data analysts who really knew nothing</p>
<p>about baseball, but were very, very good at analyzing data.</p>
<p>Uh, there&rsquo;s a metaphor there in the way that our military forces</p>
<p>at a high level had to confront this question of how should we</p>
<p>use our forces, should we dedicate them to the cumulative</p>
<p>versus the operational, uh, the, um, sequential strategies?</p>
<p>And, um, and-and eventually, the answer was, uh,</p>
<p>we should be doing a lot more on the cumulative side.</p>
<p>Uh, and that became one of the important factors</p>
<p>that led to a much earlier defeat of-of Japan</p>
<p>than, uh, we had anticipated at the beginning of the war.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating. I would&hellip;</p>
<p>The-the connection with Moneyball and the Second World War,</p>
<p>long-term overall strategy.</p>
<p>Ian W. Toll, your work is fantastic.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for coming on the program.</p>
<p>And, uh, I look forward to what&rsquo;s next.</p>
<p>Any-any hints?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m trying-I&rsquo;m trying my hand at fiction,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to say. Um, I wanted a new challenge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s inevitable.</p>
<p>But I did promise my editor that I eventually would write</p>
<p>a sequel to Six Frigates, so that&rsquo;s on deck.</p>
<p>All right, fantastic. Thank you so much for taking the time.</p>
<p>We really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thank you, Dan.</p>
<p>That was a ton of fun.</p>
<p>My thanks to Ian Toll for coming on the program.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when you&rsquo;re gonna get this,</p>
<p>but, uh, his three-book boxed set will either be out</p>
<p>by the time you hear me, or, um, soon afterwards.</p>
<p>It includes Pacific Crucible, The Conquering Tide,</p>
<p>and Twilight of the Gods.</p>
<p>And he has a lot of other books as well, so check him out.</p>
<p>If you like what we do, I bet you&rsquo;ll enjoy</p>
<p>what he does as well.</p>
<p>Just a reminder, keep your eyes peeled.</p>
<p>We should have a-an interview with him</p>
<p>at the end of the week.</p>
<p>Keep your eyes peeled.</p>
<p>We should have a-an interview with an author</p>
<p>on a very different subject</p>
<p>in the not-too-distant future come out.</p>
<p>Two hits in quick succession to make up</p>
<p>for the long delay between offerings.</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience, and as always,</p>
<p>um, thank you for everything, folks.</p>

<p>Have you ever been on a battlefield tour?</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m talking about, right?</p>
<p>You-you go to a famous battlefield</p>
<p>and you take the tour.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a very knowledgeable tour guide,</p>
<p>and they-they walk you around</p>
<p>with the rest of the tour group,</p>
<p>and they show you the battlefield from,</p>
<p>you know, a-a soldier&rsquo;s eye perspective.</p>
<p>Show you the salient, uh, historical points of interest,</p>
<p>gives you a sense of what was going on</p>
<p>on the ground back during the battle.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re really wonderful,</p>
<p>and if you get a chance to do that, you should.</p>
<p>Those of you who&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to go on</p>
<p>one of those things, or maybe if you&rsquo;re really lucky,</p>
<p>two of those things, we&rsquo;ll vouch for how helpful they are</p>
<p>into really giving you a sense of what was going on</p>
<p>that no book can really match, for example.</p>
<p>Well, during the COVID pandemic,</p>
<p>I was contacted by a group of people who do this.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re battlefield tour guides and military historians,</p>
<p>and they take people, uh, around places like</p>
<p>the First World War battlefields in France, right?</p>
<p>Well, when the pandemic hit, though,</p>
<p>like so many other businesses,</p>
<p>they were up a creek without a paddle, weren&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>What are you gonna do if you&rsquo;re a battlefield tour guide,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no tourists, because of the pandemic?</p>
<p>So, like many other businesses around the world,</p>
<p>they took a look at their business and retooled it,</p>
<p>and restructured it, and reimagined it.</p>
<p>And the way they reimagined it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tempted to say it&rsquo;s better than the original,</p>
<p>although, you know, few things beat a good battlefield tour.</p>
<p>And they still do that on the ground live,</p>
<p>but now they do it virtually as well.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so exciting, because you may know,</p>
<p>I get involved in things like immersive experiences</p>
<p>and virtual reality, and all these ways,</p>
<p>uh, that I think are key sparks for people</p>
<p>to get interested in history, beyond the names,</p>
<p>beyond the dates, appetizers, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I always say in the podcast,</p>
<p>is to an appetizer to history.</p>
<p>Well, the folks over at Battle Guide Virtual Tours</p>
<p>are doing this, too. They&rsquo;ve turned their tours,</p>
<p>which they, as I said, still do live, into virtual events.</p>
<p>Combine on-the-ground footage with the expert,</p>
<p>you know, the historian, or the battlefield tour guide,</p>
<p>add drone footage, period footage,</p>
<p>the voices of veterans mixed in there.</p>
<p>Archival film footage. I mean, a truly interactive</p>
<p>and, um, fascinating sort of an affair.</p>
<p>And if you catch it live, by the way,</p>
<p>you get to ask questions as though you were actually there.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re doing this in real life,</p>
<p>these are prohibitively expensive things,</p>
<p>unless you live near the battlefield.</p>
<p>But because it&rsquo;s been turned into a virtual tour,</p>
<p>this becomes affordable for almost everybody.</p>
<p>And these guys are offering the tours in one-off choices.</p>
<p>I mean, you can go look at their catalog</p>
<p>and pick any one you want, just buy that.</p>
<p>Or you could subscribe, and for a lower price per episode,</p>
<p>get access to everything they have</p>
<p>and everything they&rsquo;re continually adding.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>I love this as a way to sort of democratize</p>
<p>for people all over the world,</p>
<p>this battlefield tour experience.</p>
<p>And think about it this way, there are places</p>
<p>that a lot of people get to. I mean, you know,</p>
<p>getting a trip to France is not all that unusual,</p>
<p>but there are battlefields in these guys&rsquo; archives,</p>
<p>or soon to be, that are in places</p>
<p>that are very difficult for most people to get to.</p>
<p>So, a virtual tour may be the best choice for everyone.</p>
<p>Check it out, though. They&rsquo;re offering a free one,</p>
<p>if you want to see what we&rsquo;re talking about here.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re confident that you&rsquo;ll see it and want more, right?</p>
<p>So, just go to battleguide.co.uk forward slash carlin,</p>
<p>battleguide.co.uk forward slash carlin,</p>
<p>and, you know, add one of those battlefield tours</p>
<p>to your shopping cart, and then you&rsquo;ll get the discount,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get to see it for free, and then you can decide</p>
<p>if you like it enough to buy more.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll tell you something, this is one of those things</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m comfortable telling you about it,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m&hellip; This is the kind of thing I&rsquo;m all over, right?</p>
<p>Virtual tours of battlefields by experts,</p>
<p>utilizing all this technology,</p>
<p>and any cool thing that comes down the pike</p>
<p>probably going to be added to these offerings, too.</p>
<p>Check it out, Battle Guide Virtual Tours.</p>
<p>Everything from the Napoleonic Wars</p>
<p>to the modern-day stuff, specialized in First</p>
<p>and Second World War history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, um&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s the future, to be honest,</p>
<p>of battlefield tours, and I hope you like what you see.</p>
