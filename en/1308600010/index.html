    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>This podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s element.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s continue our discussion about neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>this incredible feature of our nervous system</p>
<p>that allows it to change itself in response to experience,</p>
<p>and even in ways that we consciously</p>
<p>and deliberately decide to change it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an incredible feature.</p>
<p>No other organ in our body has that capability.</p>
<p>Our nervous system, which governs everything</p>
<p>about who we are, how we feel, and what we do,</p>
<p>does have that capability.</p>
<p>The issue is most people don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how to access neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Children readily access neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t even realize that they&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>Adults want neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s what this entire month</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast has been about.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve explored neuroplasticity</p>
<p>from a variety of different perspectives,</p>
<p>we talked about representational plasticity,</p>
<p>we talked about the importance of focus and reward,</p>
<p>we talked about this amazing and somewhat surprising aspect</p>
<p>of the vestibular system,</p>
<p>how altering our relationship to gravity,</p>
<p>and in addition to that, making errors,</p>
<p>as we try and learn, can open up windows to plasticity,</p>
<p>but we have not really talked so much</p>
<p>about directing the plasticity toward particular outcomes,</p>
<p>and thus far, we really haven&rsquo;t talked yet</p>
<p>about how to undo things that we don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about learning, and I say, learn a language,</p>
<p>learn free throws, learn a particular motor skill, et cetera,</p>
<p>but what about what we would call unlearning</p>
<p>or about removing some aspect of our experience</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t want?</p>
<p>And so today, we are going to explore</p>
<p>that aspect of neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>and we are going to do that in the context</p>
<p>of a very important and somewhat sensitive topic,</p>
<p>which is pain, regeneration,</p>
<p>and in some cases, injury to the nervous system.</p>
<p>Now, for those of you that are fortunate enough</p>
<p>to not have or had a concussion,</p>
<p>or not have or know someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s experiencing chronic or acute pain,</p>
<p>I encourage you to stay in here with us,</p>
<p>because a lot of the information that we are going to cover</p>
<p>has direct relevance to neuroplasticity</p>
<p>for other purposes.</p>
<p>We, as always here on this podcast,</p>
<p>are going to discuss some of the science,</p>
<p>we get into mechanism,</p>
<p>but we also really get at principles.</p>
<p>Principles are far more important than any one experiment</p>
<p>or one description of mechanism,</p>
<p>and certainly far more important than any one protocol,</p>
<p>because principles allow you to think</p>
<p>about your nervous system and work with it</p>
<p>in ways that best serve you.</p>
<p>They are very flexible batches of information.</p>
<p>So we are going to talk about the principles</p>
<p>of neuroplasticity for removing pain</p>
<p>and wound healing and injury.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about acupuncture of all things.</p>
<p>We are going to talk about modern medicine&rsquo;s attempt</p>
<p>to try and restore youth to the aging</p>
<p>or injured or demented brain.</p>
<p>And we are going to definitely talk about tools.</p>
<p>Got a lot of tools.</p>
<p>I consulted a number of fantastic colleagues at Stanford,</p>
<p>at Harvard Medical School,</p>
<p>and in the greater community of tissue rehabilitation,</p>
<p>injury and pain management in preparation for this podcast.</p>
<p>I do want to be very clear and just remind you</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not a medical doctor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a professor, so I don&rsquo;t prescribe anything.</p>
<p>I profess things.</p>
<p>I have my beliefs,</p>
<p>but the podcast is for information purposes.</p>
<p>I do hope that the tools that we discuss</p>
<p>will be of benefit to you.</p>
<p>But as always, you should talk to your doctor</p>
<p>or healthcare provider about any tools</p>
<p>that you plan to add or are looking to explore,</p>
<p>as well as anything that you might look to remove</p>
<p>from your daily protocols.</p>
<p>In other words, don&rsquo;t change anything</p>
<p>without consulting an expert first.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re responsible for your health, not me.</p>
<p>And I say this not just to protect me,</p>
<p>but also to protect you.</p>
<p>So please keep that in mind as we move forward.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m very excited to share with you this information</p>
<p>because I do feel that it can be of great benefit</p>
<p>to a number of people.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start our discussion about pain and sensation</p>
<p>and regeneration and wound healing</p>
<p>with a discussion about a very important system</p>
<p>in the nervous system, which is the somatosensory system.</p>
<p>The somatosensory system is, as the name implies,</p>
<p>involved in understanding touch,</p>
<p>physical feeling on our body.</p>
<p>And the simplest way to think</p>
<p>about the somatosensory system</p>
<p>is that we have little sensors,</p>
<p>and those sensors come in the form of neurons, nerve cells,</p>
<p>that reside in our skin</p>
<p>and in the deeper layers below the skin.</p>
<p>And indeed we do.</p>
<p>We have some that correspond to,</p>
<p>and we should say respond to mechanical touch.</p>
<p>So, you know, pressure on the top of my hand</p>
<p>or a pinpoint or other sensors, for instance,</p>
<p>respond to heat, to cold.</p>
<p>Some respond to vibration.</p>
<p>We have a huge number of different receptors in our skin,</p>
<p>and they take that information</p>
<p>and send it down these wires that we call axons</p>
<p>in the form of electrical signals to our spinal cord</p>
<p>and then up to the brain.</p>
<p>And within the spinal cord and brain,</p>
<p>we have centers that interpret that information</p>
<p>that actually makes sense of those electrical signals.</p>
<p>And this is amazing</p>
<p>because none of those sensors</p>
<p>has a different unique form of information that it uses.</p>
<p>It just sends electrical potentials into the nervous system.</p>
<p>So the nervous system,</p>
<p>you somehow decode what a given stimulus on your skin is.</p>
<p>So maybe it&rsquo;s the wind blowing gently</p>
<p>and deflecting some of the hairs on your arm,</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s a sharp pinprick or a hot stove</p>
<p>or the warmth of a glowing fire.</p>
<p>That all arrives in your nervous system</p>
<p>in the form of these electrical things</p>
<p>we call action potentials, which is just amazing.</p>
<p>And then the brain computes them and makes sense of them.</p>
<p>So we have peripheral sensors</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve got stations up in our brain</p>
<p>and within our spinal cord</p>
<p>that makes sense of all the stuff coming in.</p>
<p>Pain and the sensation of pain is, believe it or not,</p>
<p>a controversial word in the neuroscience field.</p>
<p>People prefer to use the word nociception.</p>
<p>Nociceptors are the sensors in the skin</p>
<p>that detect particular types of stimuli.</p>
<p>It actually comes from the Latin word nocera,</p>
<p>which means to harm.</p>
<p>And why would neuroscientists not want to talk about pain?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s very subjective.</p>
<p>It has a mental component and a physical component.</p>
<p>We cannot say that pain is simply an attempt</p>
<p>to avoid physical harm to the body.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>They actually can be dissociated from one another.</p>
<p>A good example would be if, God forbid,</p>
<p>you were exposed to high levels of radiation,</p>
<p>such as working with some sort of material</p>
<p>that was radioactive,</p>
<p>or you were near a former radioactive plant,</p>
<p>or some radiation, excessive X-rays, et cetera,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t feel any pain during the X-rays.</p>
<p>In fact, you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever had X-rays, as I have,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t feel anything.</p>
<p>They put you under that lead blanket,</p>
<p>they run behind a wall, and then they, in my case,</p>
<p>they take these pictures of your teeth</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really scary because you go,</p>
<p>something really terrible must be happening here,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t feel anything.</p>
<p>But there can be a lot of tissue damage.</p>
<p>There can be mutations introduced to cells, et cetera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had X-rays.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying people shouldn&rsquo;t have X-rays,</p>
<p>but excessive X-rays certainly are not good</p>
<p>for human beings.</p>
<p>Likewise, with excessive exposure to any radiation.</p>
<p>So there can be tissue damage</p>
<p>without the physical perception</p>
<p>or mental perception of pain at all.</p>
<p>As well, there can be the belief of pain</p>
<p>or the feeling of pain without there being tissue damage.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a famous case that was published</p>
<p>in the British Journal of Medicine</p>
<p>where a construction worker,</p>
<p>I think he fell is how the story went,</p>
<p>and a 14-inch nail went through his boot</p>
<p>and up through the boot.</p>
<p>And he was in excruciating pain,</p>
<p>just beyond anything he&rsquo;d experienced.</p>
<p>He reported that he couldn&rsquo;t even move in any dimension,</p>
<p>even a tiny bit without feeling excruciating pain.</p>
<p>They brought him into the clinic, into the hospital.</p>
<p>They were able to cut away the boot,</p>
<p>and they realized that the nail had gone between two toes</p>
<p>and it had actually not impaled the skin at all.</p>
<p>His visual image of the nail going through his boot</p>
<p>gave him the feeling, the legitimate feeling,</p>
<p>that he was experiencing the pain</p>
<p>of a nail going through his foot,</p>
<p>which is incredible</p>
<p>because it speaks to the power of the mind</p>
<p>in this pain scenario.</p>
<p>And it also speaks to the power of the specificity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like he thought that his foot was on fire.</p>
<p>He thought because he saw a nail going through his foot,</p>
<p>it was going through his boot,</p>
<p>but he thought it was going through his foot,</p>
<p>that it was sharp pain of the sort</p>
<p>that a nail would produce.</p>
<p>And there are thousands</p>
<p>of these kinds of case reports out there.</p>
<p>Now, that is not to say that all pain that we experience</p>
<p>is in our head,</p>
<p>but it really speaks to the incredible capacity</p>
<p>that these top-down,</p>
<p>these higher-level cognitive functions have</p>
<p>in interpreting what we&rsquo;re experiencing out in the periphery,</p>
<p>even just on the basis of what we see.</p>
<p>And the example of radiation speaks to the fact</p>
<p>that pain and tissue damage</p>
<p>are dissociable from one another, okay?</p>
<p>So why are we talking about pain</p>
<p>during a month on neuroplasticity?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that the pain system</p>
<p>offers us a number of different principles</p>
<p>that we can leverage to,</p>
<p>A, ensure that if we are ever injured,</p>
<p>we are able to understand the difference</p>
<p>between injury and pain,</p>
<p>because there is a difference,</p>
<p>that if we&rsquo;re ever in pain,</p>
<p>that we can understand the difference</p>
<p>between injury and pain,</p>
<p>that we will be able to interpret our pain.</p>
<p>And during the course of today&rsquo;s podcast,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to cover protocols</p>
<p>that help eliminate pain from both ends of the spectrum,</p>
<p>from the periphery at the level of the injury,</p>
<p>and through these top-down mental mechanisms.</p>
<p>A lot of times on this podcast,</p>
<p>in fact, mostly I tend to center on the physiology,</p>
<p>on the really objective things that you can describe</p>
<p>and talk about, diaphragmatic movement or sunlight</p>
<p>of a particular number of photons, et cetera.</p>
<p>But today&rsquo;s a really exciting opportunity</p>
<p>for us to discuss some of the more subjective things.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, we&rsquo;re going to talk about love.</p>
<p>A colleague of mine at Stanford</p>
<p>who runs a major pain clinic is working on</p>
<p>and has published quality peer-reviewed data</p>
<p>on the role of love in modulating the pain response.</p>
<p>Only there&rsquo;s a twist to it,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not going to reveal it just yet,</p>
<p>but it turns out that the specific type of connection</p>
<p>one has to a romantic partner</p>
<p>actually dictates whether or not their love for them</p>
<p>will alleviate physical pain.</p>
<p>And the effects are really robust.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an amazing literature.</p>
<p>And so what we&rsquo;re talking about today</p>
<p>is plasticity of perception,</p>
<p>which has direct bearing on emotional pain</p>
<p>and has direct bearing on trauma</p>
<p>and other things that we&rsquo;ve discussed</p>
<p>in previous episodes a little bit,</p>
<p>but that we&rsquo;re going to explore even more</p>
<p>in an entire month about those topics.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get started in thinking about</p>
<p>what happens with pain.</p>
<p>And I will describe some examples</p>
<p>of some kind of extreme cases.</p>
<p>For instance, I will tell you just now</p>
<p>that there is a mutation,</p>
<p>a genetic mutation in a particular sodium channel.</p>
<p>A sodium channel is one of these little holes in neurons</p>
<p>that allows them to fire action potentials.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to the function of the neuron.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important for the development of certain neurons.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a particular mutation.</p>
<p>There are kids that are born without this sodium channel 1.7,</p>
<p>if you want to look it up.</p>
<p>Those kids experience no pain, no pain whatsoever.</p>
<p>And it is a terrible situation.</p>
<p>They burn themselves.</p>
<p>They tend to rest on their limbs too long.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t make the micro adjustments.</p>
<p>You might see me swiveling around in my chair,</p>
<p>moving around a lot.</p>
<p>Those micro adjustments are actually</p>
<p>normal healthy micro adjustments</p>
<p>that prevent us from going into pain.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t make those adjustments.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t get the feedback</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re in a particular position.</p>
<p>And so they never make those adjustments</p>
<p>and their joints get destroyed essentially.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t tend to live very long due to accidents.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really terrible and unfortunate circumstance.</p>
<p>Some people have a mutation in the same channel</p>
<p>where they make too much of this channel.</p>
<p>So they feel too much pain.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s reasonable to speculate</p>
<p>that one of the reasons, not all,</p>
<p>but one of the reasons why people might differ</p>
<p>in their sensitivity to pain is by way of genetic variation</p>
<p>in how many of these sorts of receptors that they express.</p>
<p>People who make too much of this receptor</p>
<p>experience extreme pain from even subtle stimuli.</p>
<p>Now, the good news is there are good drug treatments</p>
<p>that can block specifically this sodium channel 1.7.</p>
<p>And so those people get a lot of relief</p>
<p>from taking such drugs.</p>
<p>So pain and how much pain we are sensitive to</p>
<p>or insensitive to probably has some genetic basis.</p>
<p>And then of course, there are things that we can do</p>
<p>to make sure that we experience less pain,</p>
<p>although pain has this adaptive role.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about some of the features</p>
<p>of how we&rsquo;re built physically and how that relates to pain</p>
<p>and how we can recover from injury.</p>
<p>So, first of all,</p>
<p>we have maps of our body surface in our brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called a homunculus.</p>
<p>In a rat, believe it or not, I&rsquo;m not making this up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called a ratonculus.</p>
<p>In Costello, my dog is snoring behind me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dogonculus.</p>
<p>I could get into the nomenclature and why it&rsquo;s called this,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s basically a representation of the body surface.</p>
<p>That representation is scaled in a way</p>
<p>that matches sensitivity.</p>
<p>So the areas of your body that are most sensitive</p>
<p>have a lot more brain real estate devoted to them.</p>
<p>Your back is an enormous piece of tissue</p>
<p>compared to your fingertip,</p>
<p>but your back has fewer receptors devoted to it.</p>
<p>And the representation of your back in your brain</p>
<p>is actually pretty small.</p>
<p>Whereas the representation of your finger is enormous.</p>
<p>So how big a brain area is devoted</p>
<p>to a given body part is directly related</p>
<p>to the density of receptors in that body part,</p>
<p>not the size of the body part.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why if we were to draw your homunculus</p>
<p>or Costello&rsquo;s dogonculus,</p>
<p>what we would find is that certain areas like the lips,</p>
<p>like the fingertips, like the genitalia,</p>
<p>like the eyes and the area around the face</p>
<p>would have a huge representation.</p>
<p>Whereas the back, the torso,</p>
<p>and areas of the body that are less sensitive</p>
<p>are going to have smaller representation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;d be a very distorted map.</p>
<p>You can actually know how sensitive a given body part is</p>
<p>and how much brain area is devoted to it</p>
<p>through what&rsquo;s called two-point discrimination.</p>
<p>You can do this experiment if you want.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve described this once or twice before,</p>
<p>but basically if you have someone put,</p>
<p>maybe take two pens and put them maybe six inches apart</p>
<p>on your back and touch while you&rsquo;re facing away,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll ask you how many points they&rsquo;re touching you</p>
<p>and you say two.</p>
<p>But if they move those closer together, say three inches,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re likely to experience it as one point of contact.</p>
<p>Whereas on your finger, you could play that game all day.</p>
<p>And as long as there&rsquo;s a millimeter or so spacing,</p>
<p>you will know that it&rsquo;s two points as opposed to one.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s more pixels,</p>
<p>more density of receptors.</p>
<p>This has direct bearing to pain</p>
<p>because it says that areas of the body</p>
<p>that have denser receptors</p>
<p>are going to be more sensitive to pain than to others.</p>
<p>And where we have more receptors,</p>
<p>we tend to have more blood vessels and glia,</p>
<p>which are these support cells,</p>
<p>and other cells that lend to the inflammation response.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>So just as a rule of thumb,</p>
<p>areas of your body that are injured,</p>
<p>that are large areas that have low sensitivity</p>
<p>before injury likely are going to experience less pain</p>
<p>and the literature shows will heal more slowly</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have as many cells around</p>
<p>to produce inflammation.</p>
<p>And you might say, wait, I thought inflammation is bad.</p>
<p>Well, one of the things I really want to get across today</p>
<p>is that inflammation is not bad.</p>
<p>Inflammation out of control is bad,</p>
<p>but inflammation is wonderful.</p>
<p>Inflammation is the tissue repair response.</p>
<p>And we are going to talk about subjective</p>
<p>and objective ways to modulate inflammation</p>
<p>after tissue injury,</p>
<p>even after just exercise that&rsquo;s been too intense.</p>
<p>Okay, so you have this map of your body surface.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sensitive in different ways.</p>
<p>Now you know why.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got your neurobiology of somatosensation 101</p>
<p>under your belt now.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t cover everything,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll touch on some of the other details</p>
<p>as we go forward.</p>
<p>I thought it might be a nice time to just think about</p>
<p>the relationship between the periphery and the central maps</p>
<p>in a way that many of you have probably heard about before,</p>
<p>which will frame the discussion a little bit better,</p>
<p>which is phantom limb pain.</p>
<p>Now, some of you are probably familiar with this,</p>
<p>but for people that have an arm or a leg or a finger</p>
<p>or some other portion of their body amputated,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not uncommon for those people to feel</p>
<p>as if they still have that limb or appendage</p>
<p>or piece of their body intact.</p>
<p>And typically, unfortunately,</p>
<p>the sensation of that limb is not one of the limb</p>
<p>being nice and relaxed and just there.</p>
<p>The sensation is that the limb is experiencing pain</p>
<p>or is contorted in the specific orientation</p>
<p>that it was around the time of the injury.</p>
<p>So if someone has a blunt force to the hand</p>
<p>and they end up having their hand amputated,</p>
<p>typically they will continue to feel pain</p>
<p>in their phantom hand, which is pretty wild.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the representation of that hand</p>
<p>is still intact in the cortex, in the brain.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s trying to balance its levels of activity.</p>
<p>Normally, it&rsquo;s getting what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>proprioceptive feedback.</p>
<p>Proprioception is just our knowledge</p>
<p>of where our limbs are in space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an extremely important aspect</p>
<p>of our somatosensory system.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no proprioceptive feedback.</p>
<p>And so a lot of the circuits start to ramp up</p>
<p>their levels of activity,</p>
<p>and they become very conscious of the phantom limb.</p>
<p>Now, before my lab was at Stanford, I was at UC San Diego.</p>
<p>And one of my colleagues was a guy,</p>
<p>everyone just calls him by his last name, Ramachandran,</p>
<p>who is famous for understanding this phantom limb phenomenon</p>
<p>and developing a very simple,</p>
<p>but very powerful solution to it</p>
<p>that speaks to the incredible capacity</p>
<p>of top-down modulation.</p>
<p>And top-down modulation,</p>
<p>the ability to use one&rsquo;s brain, cognition, and senses</p>
<p>to control pain in the body is something that everyone,</p>
<p>not just people missing limbs or in chronic pain</p>
<p>can learn to benefit from,</p>
<p>because it is a way to tap into our ability</p>
<p>to use our mind to control perceptions</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s happening in our body.</p>
<p>And this is not a mystical statement.</p>
<p>This is not about mind, I guess, as much as it is brain</p>
<p>to control our perceptions of our body.</p>
<p>So what did Ramachandran do?</p>
<p>Ramachandran had people who were missing a limb</p>
<p>put their intact limb into a box that had mirrors in it</p>
<p>such that when they looked in the box</p>
<p>and they moved their intact limb,</p>
<p>the opposite limb, which was a reflection of the intact limb</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re missing the opposite limb,</p>
<p>they would see it as if it was intact.</p>
<p>And as they would move their intact limb,</p>
<p>they would visualize with their eyes</p>
<p>the limb that&rsquo;s in the place of the absent limb,</p>
<p>so this is all by mirrors,</p>
<p>moving around and they would feel immediate relief</p>
<p>from the phantom pain.</p>
<p>And he would tell them and they would direct their hand</p>
<p>toward a orientation that felt comfortable to them.</p>
<p>Then they would exit the mirror box,</p>
<p>they would take their hand out,</p>
<p>and they would feel as if the hand was now</p>
<p>in its relaxed normal position.</p>
<p>So you could get real time in moments</p>
<p>remapping of the representation of the hand.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>This is the kind of thing that all of us</p>
<p>would like to be able to do if we are in pain.</p>
<p>If you stub your toe, if you break your ankle,</p>
<p>if you take a hard fall on your bike,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re in chronic pain,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t it be amazing to be able to use a mind trick,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a trick, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s real visual imagery</p>
<p>to remap your representation of your body surface</p>
<p>and where your body is.</p>
<p>That is something that we could all benefit from</p>
<p>because if you do anything for long enough, including live,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to experience pain of some sort.</p>
<p>And this, again, I just want to remind you</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t just about physical injuries and pain.</p>
<p>This has direct relevance to emotional pain as well,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll, of course, we&rsquo;ll talk about.</p>
<p>So the Ramachandran studies were really profound</p>
<p>because they said a couple of things.</p>
<p>One, plasticity can be very fast,</p>
<p>that it can be driven by the experience of something,</p>
<p>just the visual experience.</p>
<p>He had people do this mirror box thing,</p>
<p>but not look into the mirror box,</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t get the remapping.</p>
<p>So it required visual imagery coming in.</p>
<p>We also know, for instance,</p>
<p>that in cases like where people are congenitally deaf,</p>
<p>the cochlear implant, which is simply a way of putting,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not simple, but it&rsquo;s a way of putting in a device</p>
<p>that replaces the cochlea,</p>
<p>the device that we&rsquo;re normally born with in the ear</p>
<p>that has these little, what are called hair cells</p>
<p>that deflect according to sound waves</p>
<p>and allow us to hear by replacing</p>
<p>the normal hearing apparatus that&rsquo;s deficient</p>
<p>in deaf people with this cochlear implant,</p>
<p>the brain can make sense of this artificial ear, basically.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the outside ear, not the pinna, but the inner ear,</p>
<p>and they can start to hear sounds.</p>
<p>Now, some people really like the artificial cochlea.</p>
<p>They really benefit from it.</p>
<p>It restores their ability to hear, and they like it.</p>
<p>Other people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Some deaf people would prefer not to hear anything</p>
<p>and it can be very disruptive to them,</p>
<p>and some of that might have to do with the need</p>
<p>for further, better engineering of these artificial cochleas,</p>
<p>but all this really speaks to the fact</p>
<p>that the brain is an adaptive device.</p>
<p>It will respond to what you give it.</p>
<p>It is not a device that is fixed.</p>
<p>In fact, the essence of the brain,</p>
<p>especially the human brain, is to take sensory inputs</p>
<p>and to make sense of those, meaning cognitive sense,</p>
<p>and then to interpret those signals,</p>
<p>and so this may come as a shock to some of you,</p>
<p>and by no means am I trying to be insensitive,</p>
<p>but pain is a perceptual thing</p>
<p>as much as it&rsquo;s a physical thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a belief system</p>
<p>about what you&rsquo;re experiencing in your body,</p>
<p>and that has important relevance</p>
<p>for healing different types of injury</p>
<p>and the pain associated with that injury.</p>
<p>In people&rsquo;s pursuit for neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>a question that comes up every once in a while</p>
<p>is people will say, you know,</p>
<p>if I just brush my teeth with the opposite hand</p>
<p>for a couple nights in a row, will I get neuroplasticity?</p>
<p>And the answer is probably yes.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a deliberate action.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re focusing on it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an end goal.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very likely to make errors,</p>
<p>like, you know, dropping an interior lip and gums at first</p>
<p>and then getting better at it,</p>
<p>and as you heard in last episode,</p>
<p>making errors is really important</p>
<p>because those errors are the signal</p>
<p>that plasticity needs to happen,</p>
<p>and then when you get the actions correct,</p>
<p>then those correct actions are programmed in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that brushing one&rsquo;s teeth</p>
<p>with the opposite hand is the most effective use</p>
<p>of this incredible thing that we have, which is plasticity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to open up plasticity for many other things,</p>
<p>so if that were really important to you,</p>
<p>for whatever reason, maybe you have a crowded bathroom</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s easier to do on one side or the other, then fine,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of hard to imagine</p>
<p>why this would be a highly adaptive behavior,</p>
<p>unless, of course, you have an injured limb</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re missing a limb,</p>
<p>and that gets me to some really exciting</p>
<p>and important studies that were performed</p>
<p>mostly in the 90s as well as in the 2000s</p>
<p>and that for now, there is really a solid base of data.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really a center of mass</p>
<p>around a particular set of experiments</p>
<p>that point to particular protocols</p>
<p>for how to overcome motor injury,</p>
<p>and this may resonate with some of you</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve ever been injured to the point</p>
<p>where you couldn&rsquo;t walk well, temporarily, I hope,</p>
<p>or even longer, so think about a sprained ankle scenario</p>
<p>or a broken arm scenario.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all familiar with the stories</p>
<p>of people having a cast on and then getting the cast off</p>
<p>and that the particular limb that wasn&rsquo;t being used</p>
<p>that was casted is much smaller and atrophied.</p>
<p>Most of that atrophy, you might be surprised to learn,</p>
<p>is not because the muscles aren&rsquo;t being used,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because the nerves sending signals</p>
<p>to those muscles are not active,</p>
<p>and therefore, the muscles aren&rsquo;t contracting.</p>
<p>Work done by a guy named Timothy Schallert</p>
<p>and his graduate students and postdocs,</p>
<p>Teresa Jones and others, in the 90s and 2000s,</p>
<p>showed something really wonderful</p>
<p>that I think we can all benefit from</p>
<p>should we have an injury,</p>
<p>and even if we simply want to balance out imbalances</p>
<p>in our motor activity,</p>
<p>and I think all of us tend to be stronger on one side</p>
<p>or the other side.</p>
<p>Usually, a right-handed person will be stronger</p>
<p>in their left arm, not always, for compensatory reasons.</p>
<p>Some other time, we can talk about handwriting.</p>
<p>The lefties likely will be stronger in their right arm,</p>
<p>although it kind of depends</p>
<p>on whether or not people are hook righties,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you kind of hook around</p>
<p>and write from the top, or hook lefties.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of theories about this</p>
<p>that we can talk about, right brain, left brain,</p>
<p>math proficiency, et cetera.</p>
<p>In any event, what Schallert and colleagues showed</p>
<p>was that if we have damage to our brain</p>
<p>in the sensory motor pathways,</p>
<p>any number of different sensory motor pathways,</p>
<p>or we have damage to a limb,</p>
<p>could be a leg, could be an arm, could be a hand,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s great benefit to restricting the use</p>
<p>of the opposite better performing uninjured limb,</p>
<p>or hand, or other part of the body.</p>
<p>They had about a dozen papers showing</p>
<p>that if there was damage centrally in the brain,</p>
<p>or there was damage to a limb,</p>
<p>so unilateral damage, as we say, one side,</p>
<p>the thing to do is not to cast up the damaged side,</p>
<p>although you need to do that to protect the limb,</p>
<p>of course, from further damage.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s a broken arm, you need to cast the arm,</p>
<p>or you need to brace the arm,</p>
<p>but that the key thing was to restrict movement</p>
<p>of the intact uninjured opposite limb.</p>
<p>And when they did that,</p>
<p>it forced some movement in the injured limb,</p>
<p>and remarkably, through connections</p>
<p>from the two sides of the brain,</p>
<p>through the corpus callosum,</p>
<p>this huge fiber pathway that links</p>
<p>the two sides of the brain,</p>
<p>they saw plasticity on both sides of the brain.</p>
<p>So this makes sense when you hear it,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say I injure my left ankle,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m limping along, or I&rsquo;m using crutches,</p>
<p>you would think, well,</p>
<p>the first thing you want to do is start,</p>
<p>is injure your opposite limb,</p>
<p>or not use your opposite limb,</p>
<p>my right ankle is perfectly fine.</p>
<p>But if I lean too hard on my right limb,</p>
<p>and I take all the work out of the left limb,</p>
<p>the left ankle, that&rsquo;s actually setting up a situation</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s going to be runaway asymmetry</p>
<p>in the central pathways,</p>
<p>and the nerve to muscle pathways on my left side.</p>
<p>And so what they suggested,</p>
<p>and what they showed in a variety of experiments</p>
<p>was that by encouraging activity of the injured limb,</p>
<p>provided it could be done without pain,</p>
<p>and importantly, not just exercising that limb</p>
<p>or part of the body,</p>
<p>but restricting the opposite healthy part of the body,</p>
<p>that the speed of recovery was significantly faster.</p>
<p>Now, I want to repeat,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to go injuring something further,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably the worst thing you could do.</p>
<p>But in some cases where people have damage in their brain,</p>
<p>the limbs are perfectly fine,</p>
<p>but the motor signals aren&rsquo;t getting down to the limbs.</p>
<p>And in that case, the limb is fine.</p>
<p>So you actually are free to use either limb</p>
<p>as much as you want.</p>
<p>And in that case,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to rely on the uninjured pathway too much.</p>
<p>In fact, you want to restrict the uninjured pathway.</p>
<p>So I find these studies remarkable,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve been followed up on at the molecular level,</p>
<p>at the cellular level, many times.</p>
<p>And I think the physiotherapists out there,</p>
<p>and the rest of you who are involved in sports medicine,</p>
<p>and some of the physicians will say,</p>
<p>well, of course that makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>But oftentimes this is not what happens.</p>
<p>Oftentimes what happens is it&rsquo;s all about resting</p>
<p>and limiting inflammation, et cetera,</p>
<p>of the injured limb or the limbs corresponding</p>
<p>to the injured part of the brain.</p>
<p>And these experiments and the collection of them</p>
<p>point to the fact that the balance between the right</p>
<p>and left side of our body is always dynamic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always being updated at the level of neural circuitry.</p>
<p>The Ramachandran studies with the mirror box</p>
<p>support that too.</p>
<p>And that even slight imbalances in the two sides</p>
<p>of the body can get amplified.</p>
<p>And so when you&rsquo;re in a situation where one side is injured</p>
<p>or the brain is injured representing one side of the body,</p>
<p>the key thing to do is to really overwork the side</p>
<p>that needs the work and to restrict the activity</p>
<p>of the side that doesn&rsquo;t need the work because it&rsquo;s healthy.</p>
<p>And this has great semblance to ocular dominance plasticity,</p>
<p>which I talked about a couple episodes ago.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t go into it in detail,</p>
<p>but where the Nobel prize winning neurobiologists,</p>
<p>Torrence Weasel and David Hubel showed that if one eye</p>
<p>is closed early in development,</p>
<p>that the representation of the opposite eye in the brain</p>
<p>is completely overtaken by the intact eye.</p>
<p>So this is important.</p>
<p>It means that all of our senses and our movements</p>
<p>are competing for space in our brain.</p>
<p>And so the way to think about the principle</p>
<p>is anytime you&rsquo;re injured and you&rsquo;re hobbling along,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to injure yourself further,</p>
<p>but you want to try and compensate in the ways</p>
<p>that respect this competition for neural real estate.</p>
<p>And what that usually means is not relying</p>
<p>on where you&rsquo;re still strong,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s just going to create runaway plasticity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to make it very hard for you to recover</p>
<p>the motor function and in some cases,</p>
<p>the sensory function of the damaged limb.</p>
<p>Some of you may be wondering how long and how often</p>
<p>one should restrict the activity of the intact</p>
<p>or healthy limb or limbs in some cases.</p>
<p>And the answer is you don&rsquo;t have to do that</p>
<p>all day, every day.</p>
<p>These experiments centered on doing one or two hours</p>
<p>of dedicated work, sensory motor work,</p>
<p>or so for instance, if you had a sprained ankle on the left,</p>
<p>you might spend part of the day where your left leg,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s not too painful, can be exercised</p>
<p>and in a way that&rsquo;s not damaging to the injury.</p>
<p>And the right limb can&rsquo;t contribute to that exercise.</p>
<p>So this might be pedaling unilaterally</p>
<p>on a stationary bike.</p>
<p>If you can do that for a different type of limb injury,</p>
<p>like an arm injury, this might be reaching,</p>
<p>provided the shoulder is mobile, doing reaching,</p>
<p>it might be even writing with the damaged side</p>
<p>and then intentionally not writing</p>
<p>with the preferred or undamaged side.</p>
<p>This has been shown to accelerate the central plasticity</p>
<p>and the recovery of function,</p>
<p>which I think is what most people want.</p>
<p>When people are injured,</p>
<p>they want to get back to doing what they</p>
<p>were doing previously,</p>
<p>and they want to be able to do that without pain.</p>
<p>Now, this brings up another topic,</p>
<p>which is definitely related to neuroplasticity and injury,</p>
<p>but is a more general one that I hear about a lot,</p>
<p>which is traumatic brain injury.</p>
<p>Many injuries are not just about the limb</p>
<p>and the lack of use of the limb,</p>
<p>but concussion and head injury.</p>
<p>And I want to emphasize, I&rsquo;m not a neurologist.</p>
<p>I have many colleagues that are.</p>
<p>At some point, we will do a whole month on TBI</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such a serious issue</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s such a huge discussion.</p>
<p>But I want to talk a little bit about what is known</p>
<p>about recovery from concussion.</p>
<p>And this is very important because it has implications</p>
<p>for just normal aging as well and offset setting</p>
<p>some of the cognitive decline and physical decline</p>
<p>that occurs with normal aging.</p>
<p>So we shouldn&rsquo;t think of TBI as just for the football players</p>
<p>or just for the kids that had an injury</p>
<p>or just for the person that was in the car accident.</p>
<p>We want to learn about TBI and understand TBI</p>
<p>for those folks, but we&rsquo;re also going to talk about TBI</p>
<p>as it relates to general degradation of brain function,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a certain resemblance there</p>
<p>of TBI to general brain aging.</p>
<p>Typically after TBI, there are a number of different things</p>
<p>that happen and there are a huge range of things</p>
<p>that can create TBI.</p>
<p>Neurologists and the emergency room physicians</p>
<p>are going to want to know, was the skull itself injured</p>
<p>or did the brain rattle around in the skull?</p>
<p>Was there actually a breach through the skull?</p>
<p>Is there a physical object in there?</p>
<p>How many concussions has the person had?</p>
<p>I mean, everyone&rsquo;s situation with TBI</p>
<p>is incredibly different.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a constellation of symptoms that many people,</p>
<p>if not all people with TBI report,</p>
<p>which is headache, photophobia,</p>
<p>that lights become kind of aversive,</p>
<p>sleep disruption, trouble concentrating,</p>
<p>sometimes mood issues.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge range,</p>
<p>and of course the severity will vary, et cetera.</p>
<p>In a previous episode, I mentioned the Kennard Principle.</p>
<p>The Kennard Principle, named by and after</p>
<p>the famous neurologist, Margaret Kennard,</p>
<p>said that if you&rsquo;re going to get a brain injury,</p>
<p>better to get it early in life than later in life.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the brain has a much greater</p>
<p>or heightened capacity for repairing itself</p>
<p>early in life than later.</p>
<p>But of course, none of us want TBI</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t pick when you get your TBI.</p>
<p>You can avoid certain activities that would give you TBI.</p>
<p>But really when it comes to TBI,</p>
<p>there are a couple of things</p>
<p>that are agreed upon across the board.</p>
<p>The first one is, as much as possible,</p>
<p>you want to avoid a second traumatic brain injury</p>
<p>or concussion.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s going to be a tough one</p>
<p>for some of the athletes</p>
<p>and even recreational athletes to swallow</p>
<p>because they want to continue in their sport.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not here to tell you</p>
<p>that you should or you shouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s simply the way that it is.</p>
<p>For folks that are in military</p>
<p>or that are in certain professions,</p>
<p>construction is a place where we see a lot of TBI.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always just football.</p>
<p>A lot of construction workers are dealing</p>
<p>with heavy objects swinging around in space.</p>
<p>They wear those hard hat helmets,</p>
<p>which unfortunately don&rsquo;t protect much</p>
<p>against a lot of those blunt forces</p>
<p>and certainly not against falls and things of that sort.</p>
<p>So many people in order to survive</p>
<p>and feed their families have to go back to work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear that regardless</p>
<p>of whether or not there was a skull break</p>
<p>and regardless of when the TBI happened</p>
<p>or how many times it&rsquo;s happened,</p>
<p>that the system that repairs the brain, the adult brain,</p>
<p>is mainly centered around this lymphatic system</p>
<p>that we call for the brain, the glymphatic system.</p>
<p>Now, the brain wasn&rsquo;t thought to have a lymphatic system.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t thought to have circulating immune cells,</p>
<p>but about 10 years ago, it was sort of rediscovered</p>
<p>because if you look in the literature,</p>
<p>you realize this stuff was around longer,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a glymphatic system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like a sewer system</p>
<p>that clears out the debris that surrounds neurons,</p>
<p>especially injured neurons.</p>
<p>And the glymphatic system is very active during sleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been imaged in functional</p>
<p>and magnetic resonance imaging.</p>
<p>And the glymphatic system is something</p>
<p>that you want very active</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to clear away the debris</p>
<p>that sits between the neurons.</p>
<p>And the cells that surround the connections</p>
<p>between the neurons called the glia,</p>
<p>those cells are actively involved</p>
<p>in repairing the connections between neurons when damaged.</p>
<p>So the glymphatic system is so important</p>
<p>that many people, if not all people</p>
<p>who get TBI are told get adequate rest, you need to sleep.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of twofold advice.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it&rsquo;s telling you to get sleep</p>
<p>because all these good things happen in sleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also about getting those people</p>
<p>to not continue to engage in their activity full-time</p>
<p>or really try and hammer through it.</p>
<p>You might say, well, if you have trouble sleeping,</p>
<p>how are you supposed to get deep sleep?</p>
<p>Most of the activity of the glymphatic system,</p>
<p>this washout of the debris</p>
<p>is occurring during slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>Slow wave sleep, as I mentioned in a previous episode,</p>
<p>is something that happens typically</p>
<p>in the early part of the evening.</p>
<p>So even for those of you that are falling</p>
<p>or early part of the night, rather,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re falling asleep</p>
<p>and then waking up three, four hours later,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important that you continue to get sleep,</p>
<p>but know that the slow wave sleep</p>
<p>is mainly packed toward the early part of the night.</p>
<p>So that hopefully will alleviate some of the anxiety</p>
<p>of the 3 and 4 a.m. wake up,</p>
<p>although you really should follow some of the protocols</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve suggested in your physician&rsquo;s protocols</p>
<p>in order to try and get regular longer sleep</p>
<p>of seven, eight hours.</p>
<p>Later, we&rsquo;re going to talk about the eight-hour mark</p>
<p>as a prerequisite for repair.</p>
<p>The glymphatic system has been shown</p>
<p>to be activated further in two ways.</p>
<p>One is that sleeping on one side, not on back or stomach,</p>
<p>seems to increase the amount of washout</p>
<p>or wash through, I should say, of the glymphatic system.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t a ton of data on this,</p>
<p>but the data that exists are pretty solid.</p>
<p>Again, sleeping on one side</p>
<p>or with feet slightly elevated as well</p>
<p>has been shown to increase the rate of clearance</p>
<p>of some of the debris.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the way that the glymphatic system works</p>
<p>is it has a physical pressure fluid dynamic to it</p>
<p>that allow it to work more efficiently</p>
<p>when one is sleeping on their side</p>
<p>or with feet slightly elevated.</p>
<p>So this means not falling asleep in a chair</p>
<p>while watching TV.</p>
<p>This means, if possible,</p>
<p>not falling asleep on one&rsquo;s back or on one&rsquo;s stomach,</p>
<p>sleeping on one&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t really like to sleep on my side.</p>
<p>I sleep with my feet slightly elevated.</p>
<p>I put out the kind of thin pillow under my ankles.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have TBI,</p>
<p>but I have had a few concussions before,</p>
<p>but right now I feel fine.</p>
<p>But I find that putting the pillow under my ankles</p>
<p>helps me sleep much more deeply</p>
<p>and I wake up feeling much more refreshed.</p>
<p>The other thing that has been shown</p>
<p>to improve the function of the glymphatic system,</p>
<p>and this is, again, is for sake of TBI,</p>
<p>as well as for everyone, even without brain injury,</p>
<p>is a certain form of exercise.</p>
<p>And I want to be very, very clear here.</p>
<p>I will never, and I am not suggesting</p>
<p>that people exercise in any way</p>
<p>that aggravates their injury</p>
<p>or that goes against their physician&rsquo;s advice.</p>
<p>Take your physician&rsquo;s advice</p>
<p>as to whether or not you should be exercising at all</p>
<p>and how much and to what intensity.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s some interesting data,</p>
<p>and we can provide a link to the review on this.</p>
<p>It shows that exercise of what,</p>
<p>I guess people would nowadays call it zone two cardio,</p>
<p>which is kind of low-level cardio</p>
<p>that one could do while talking to somebody else.</p>
<p>You could maintain a conversation,</p>
<p>although you don&rsquo;t have to talk to somebody else.</p>
<p>It just gives you a sense of the intensity of the exercise.</p>
<p>That zone two cardio for 30 to 45 minutes,</p>
<p>three times a week,</p>
<p>seems to improve the rates of clearance</p>
<p>of some of the debris after injury,</p>
<p>and in general, injury or no,</p>
<p>to accelerate and improve the rates of flow</p>
<p>for the glymphatic system.</p>
<p>I find this really interesting</p>
<p>because I think nowadays there&rsquo;s such an obsession</p>
<p>with high-intensity interval training</p>
<p>and people trying to pack in as much as they can</p>
<p>into a short workout,</p>
<p>which is great if it brings people to the table</p>
<p>who haven&rsquo;t been exercising before,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s really important that we know</p>
<p>that the data on exercise</p>
<p>and its relationship to brain health</p>
<p>speak to doing 30 to 45 minutes</p>
<p>of this kind of what we kind of call low-level cardio.</p>
<p>It could be fast walking.</p>
<p>It could be jogging,</p>
<p>if you can do that with your injury safely.</p>
<p>Could be cycling.</p>
<p>This is not the kind of workout</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s designed to get your heart rate up</p>
<p>to the point where you&rsquo;re improving your fitness levels</p>
<p>at some sort of massive rate</p>
<p>or taking huge jumps in your VO2 max or anything like that.</p>
<p>This is exercise, I do this,</p>
<p>and I know a number of other people,</p>
<p>especially people in communities</p>
<p>where there is a lot of TBI</p>
<p>are now starting to adopt this,</p>
<p>that the 30 to 45 minutes,</p>
<p>three times a week or so, could be more,</p>
<p>of this zone two type cardio can be very beneficial</p>
<p>for washout of debris from the brain.</p>
<p>And this is really interesting outside of TBI</p>
<p>because what we know from aging</p>
<p>is that aging is a non-linear process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like with every year of life,</p>
<p>your brain gets a little older.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, it has,</p>
<p>sometimes it follows what&rsquo;s more like a step function.</p>
<p>Like you get these big jumps in markers of aging.</p>
<p>I guess that we could think of them as jumps down</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a negative thing for most everybody</p>
<p>who would like to live longer</p>
<p>and be healthier in brain and body.</p>
<p>And so the types of exercise I&rsquo;m referring to now</p>
<p>are really more about brain longevity</p>
<p>and about keeping the brain healthy</p>
<p>than they are about physical fitness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason why you couldn&rsquo;t do this</p>
<p>and also provide it again, it&rsquo;s safe for you,</p>
<p>given your brain state and injury state, et cetera.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason why you couldn&rsquo;t also combine it</p>
<p>with weight training and other forms of cardio.</p>
<p>So I think this is really interesting.</p>
<p>And if some of you would like to know</p>
<p>the mechanism or at least the hypothesized mechanism,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a molecule called aquaporin-4.</p>
<p>It almost sounds like the fourth in a sequel of movies</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>But aquaporin-4 is a molecule</p>
<p>that is related to the glial system.</p>
<p>So glia, it means glue in Latin,</p>
<p>are these cells in the brain,</p>
<p>the most numerous cells in the brain, in fact,</p>
<p>that in sheath synapses, but they&rsquo;re very dynamic cells.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like little ambulance cells.</p>
<p>The microglia will run in and will gather up debris</p>
<p>and soak it up and then run out after an injury.</p>
<p>Aquaporin-4 is mainly expressed by the glial cell</p>
<p>called the astrocyte.</p>
<p>Astro, it looks like a little star.</p>
<p>Incredibly interesting cells.</p>
<p>And the thing to remember</p>
<p>is that the astrocytes bridge the connection</p>
<p>between the neurons, the synapse,</p>
<p>the connections between them and the vasculature,</p>
<p>the blood system and the glymphatic system.</p>
<p>So they kind of sit at the interface</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to imagine somebody on an emergency site,</p>
<p>car crash site, who&rsquo;s directing everybody around</p>
<p>as to what to do.</p>
<p>Get that person on a stretcher, bandage them up,</p>
<p>call their mother, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>Get this out of the road, put down some flares.</p>
<p>The astrocytes kind of work in that capacity</p>
<p>as well as doing some things more directly.</p>
<p>So this glymphatic system and the glial astrocyte system</p>
<p>is a system that we want chronically active</p>
<p>throughout the day as much as possible.</p>
<p>So low-level walking, zone two cardio,</p>
<p>and then at night during slow wave sleep</p>
<p>is when really when this glymphatic system kicks in.</p>
<p>So that should hopefully be an actionable takeaway</p>
<p>provided that you can do that kind of cardio safely</p>
<p>that I believe everybody should be doing</p>
<p>who cares about brain longevity,</p>
<p>not just people who are trying to get over TBI.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to return a little bit</p>
<p>to some of the subjective aspects of pain modulation</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s so interesting and so actionable</p>
<p>that everyone should know about this.</p>
<p>And in this case, we can also say that</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not you&rsquo;re experiencing pain,</p>
<p>acute or chronic, what I&rsquo;m about to tell you</p>
<p>is as close as anything is to proof,</p>
<p>in science we rarely talk about proof,</p>
<p>we talk about evidence in favor or against a hypothesis,</p>
<p>but as close as possible to proof that our interpretation,</p>
<p>our subjective interpretation of a sensory event</p>
<p>is immensely powerful for dictating</p>
<p>our experience of the event.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of examples.</p>
<p>First of all, anyone who&rsquo;s ever done combat sports</p>
<p>or martial arts knows that it&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>how little a punch hurts during a fight</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s incredible how much it hurts after a fight.</p>
<p>The molecule adrenaline when it&rsquo;s liberated into our body</p>
<p>truly blunts our experience of pain.</p>
<p>We all know the stories of people walking miles</p>
<p>on stumped legs, people doing all sorts of things</p>
<p>that were incredible feats that allowed them to move through</p>
<p>what would otherwise be pain</p>
<p>and afterward they do experience extreme pain,</p>
<p>but during the event oftentimes</p>
<p>they are not experiencing pain</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because of the pain blunting effects</p>
<p>of adrenaline.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you exactly how this works in a few minutes</p>
<p>when we talk about acupuncture,</p>
<p>but norepinephrine binding to particular receptors,</p>
<p>adrenaline binding to particular receptors</p>
<p>actually shuts down pain pathways.</p>
<p>People who anticipate an injection of morphine</p>
<p>immediately report the feeling of loss of pain.</p>
<p>Their pain starts to diminish</p>
<p>because they know they&rsquo;re going to get pain relief</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a powerful effect.</p>
<p>Now, all of you are probably saying placebo effect.</p>
<p>Placebo effects are very real.</p>
<p>Placebo effects and belief effects as they&rsquo;re called</p>
<p>have a profound effect on our experience</p>
<p>of noxious stimuli like pain</p>
<p>and they can also have a profound effect</p>
<p>on positive stimuli</p>
<p>and things that we&rsquo;re looking forward to.</p>
<p>One study that I think is particularly interesting here</p>
<p>is from my colleague at Stanford, Sean Mackey.</p>
<p>They did a neuroimaging study.</p>
<p>They subjected people to pain.</p>
<p>In this case, it was a heat pain.</p>
<p>People have very specific thresholds to heat</p>
<p>at which they cannot tolerate any more heat,</p>
<p>but they explored the extent to which looking at an image</p>
<p>of somebody, in this case, a romantic partner</p>
<p>that the person loved</p>
<p>would allow them to adjust their pain response.</p>
<p>And it turns out it does.</p>
<p>If people are looking at an image</p>
<p>or thinking about a person that they love</p>
<p>or even a thing that they love, a pet that they love,</p>
<p>studies previous to the one that Mackey and colleagues did</p>
<p>showed that their experience of pain was reduced.</p>
<p>Their threshold for pain was higher.</p>
<p>They could tolerate more pain</p>
<p>and they reported it as not as painful.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a twist there,</p>
<p>which is it turns out that the extent to which love</p>
<p>will modulate pain has everything to do</p>
<p>with how infatuated and obsessed somebody is</p>
<p>with the object of their love.</p>
<p>People that report thinking about somebody or a pet</p>
<p>for many hours of the day,</p>
<p>kind of having an obsessive nature,</p>
<p>like almost like kind of what people might call,</p>
<p>quote unquote, codependency.</p>
<p>For those of you that are listening,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just providing air quotes</p>
<p>because codependency is kind of a clinical thing now,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s thrown around a lot all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like gaslighting.</p>
<p>People talk about gaslighting all the time now.</p>
<p>Gaslighting is a real thing,</p>
<p>but then people talk about gaslighting</p>
<p>for many things outside the clinical description.</p>
<p>If people are very obsessed with somebody,</p>
<p>they have a kind of obsessive love of somebody&rsquo;s face,</p>
<p>even if the other person doesn&rsquo;t know them,</p>
<p>which is a little weird,</p>
<p>that response, that feeling of love internally</p>
<p>can blunt the pain experience to a significant degree.</p>
<p>These are not small effects.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just that love can protect us from pain,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that infatuation and obsession</p>
<p>can protect us from pain.</p>
<p>And not surprisingly, how early a relationship is,</p>
<p>how new a relationship is,</p>
<p>directly correlates with people&rsquo;s ability, they showed,</p>
<p>to use this love, this internal representation of love,</p>
<p>to blunt the pain response.</p>
<p>So for those of you that have been with your partners</p>
<p>for many years and you love them very much</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re obsessed with them, terrific.</p>
<p>You have a pre-installed,</p>
<p>I suppose it&rsquo;s not pre-installed,</p>
<p>you had to do the work because relationships are work,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve got a installed mechanism</p>
<p>for blunting pain.</p>
<p>And again, these are not minor effects.</p>
<p>These are major effects.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all going to be through that top-down modulation</p>
<p>that we talked about,</p>
<p>not unlike the mirror box experiments with phantom limb</p>
<p>that relieve phantom pain,</p>
<p>or some other top-down modulation</p>
<p>in the opposite example is the nail through the boot,</p>
<p>which is a visual image that made the person think</p>
<p>it was painful when in fact it was painful,</p>
<p>even though there was no tissue damage.</p>
<p>It was all perceptual.</p>
<p>So the pain system is really subject</p>
<p>to these perceptual influences,</p>
<p>which is remarkable because really,</p>
<p>when we think about the somatosensory system,</p>
<p>it has this cognitive component,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got this peripheral component,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s another component,</p>
<p>which is the way in which our sensation,</p>
<p>our somatosensory system is woven in</p>
<p>with our autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to get to that next,</p>
<p>but I want to just raise the idea</p>
<p>that the reason that this kind of infatuation</p>
<p>and obsessive love can blunt the pain response</p>
<p>and increase one&rsquo;s threshold for pain may have to do,</p>
<p>I would say almost certainly has to do,</p>
<p>but it hasn&rsquo;t been measured yet,</p>
<p>with dopamine release,</p>
<p>because dopamine is absolutely the molecule</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s liberated in our brain and body</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a new kind of obsession or infatuation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very distinct from the kind of love chemicals,</p>
<p>if you will.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even like calling them love chemicals,</p>
<p>that just feels weird.</p>
<p>If this were text, I would delete that line,</p>
<p>but from the chemicals associated with warmth</p>
<p>and connection, such as serotonin and oxytocin,</p>
<p>which tend to be for more stable,</p>
<p>long-lasting relationships,</p>
<p>dopamine is what dilates the pupils,</p>
<p>which gets people really excited.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t stop thinking about somebody.</p>
<p>The text messages are even exciting.</p>
<p>They write to them and they can&rsquo;t wait</p>
<p>for the text message to come back,</p>
<p>the dot, dot, dot on the screen,</p>
<p>the text message is excruciating.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t respond for two minutes</p>
<p>and people are getting flipped out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not here to support that kind of whatever.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is that that obsessive type of love,</p>
<p>which without question is going to be associated</p>
<p>with the dopamine pathway,</p>
<p>does seem to have a utility in the context</p>
<p>of reducing the unpleasantness of physical pain,</p>
<p>and probably has a lot to do</p>
<p>with reducing the unpleasantness of a lot of life,</p>
<p>like sitting in traffic, et cetera,</p>
<p>because when we talk about pain,</p>
<p>emotional pain and physical pain</p>
<p>start to become one in the same.</p>
<p>They are so closely intertwined</p>
<p>that the lines between them neurally become very blurry.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, if love and infatuation can reduce pain,</p>
<p>presumably through the release of dopamine,</p>
<p>well then does dopamine release itself, blunt pain,</p>
<p>should we be chasing dopamine release</p>
<p>as a way to treat chronic and acute pain?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re going to talk about now.</p>
<p>Independent of love,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk about something quite different,</p>
<p>which is putting needles and electricity</p>
<p>in different parts of the body, so-called acupuncture,</p>
<p>something that for many people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been viewed as a kind of alternative medicine,</p>
<p>but now there are excellent laboratories</p>
<p>exploring what&rsquo;s called electroacupuncture and acupuncture.</p>
<p>These are big university centers.</p>
<p>In fact, my source for everything</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to tell you next</p>
<p>is Professor Chu Fu Ma at Harvard Medical School</p>
<p>and his papers.</p>
<p>I stand behind the information that I&rsquo;m going to provide</p>
<p>today, but it&rsquo;s extracted largely from the Ma Lab&rsquo;s papers,</p>
<p>which use very rigorous variable isolating experiments</p>
<p>to address just how does something like acupuncture work?</p>
<p>And I think what you&rsquo;ll be interested in</p>
<p>and surprised to learn is that it does work,</p>
<p>but sometimes it can exacerbate pain</p>
<p>and sometimes it can relieve pain.</p>
<p>And it all does that through very discrete pathways</p>
<p>for which we can really say,</p>
<p>this neuron connects to that neuron,</p>
<p>connects to the adrenals,</p>
<p>and we can tie this all back to dopamine</p>
<p>because in the end, it&rsquo;s the chemicals and neural circuits</p>
<p>that are giving rise to these perceptions</p>
<p>or these experiences rather of things</p>
<p>that we call pain, love, et cetera.</p>
<p>In a previous podcast episode,</p>
<p>I mentioned my experience of visiting an acupuncturist</p>
<p>and getting acupuncture.</p>
<p>The acupuncture itself didn&rsquo;t really do that much for me,</p>
<p>but I wasn&rsquo;t there for any specific reason.</p>
<p>It was gifted to me by somebody and I wanted to try it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not passing judgment on acupuncture.</p>
<p>In fact, I know a number of people</p>
<p>that really derive tremendous benefit from acupuncture</p>
<p>for pain and for gastrointestinal issues.</p>
<p>There are actually a lot of really good peer-reviewed</p>
<p>studies supporting the use of acupuncture</p>
<p>for in particular GI tract issues.</p>
<p>In recent years, there&rsquo;s been an emphasis</p>
<p>on trying to understand the mechanism</p>
<p>of things like acupuncture and acupuncture itself,</p>
<p>not to support acupuncture</p>
<p>or to try to get everybody to do acupuncture,</p>
<p>but as a way to try and understand</p>
<p>how these sorts of practices might actually benefit people</p>
<p>who are experiencing pain or for changing the nervous system</p>
<p>or brain-body relationship in general.</p>
<p>And actually, the National Institutes of Health</p>
<p>in the United States now has a entire subdivision,</p>
<p>an institute within the National Institutes of Health,</p>
<p>which is complementary health.</p>
<p>And that institute is interested in things like acupuncture</p>
<p>and a variety of other practices</p>
<p>that I think 10, 15 years ago,</p>
<p>people probably thought were really alternative</p>
<p>and maybe even counterculture, at least in the States.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>I think people are starting to really take a look</p>
<p>at what&rsquo;s going on under the hood</p>
<p>for certain types of treatments that are very useful.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s very likely to lead</p>
<p>to an expanded number of treatments</p>
<p>for a number of different conditions.</p>
<p>What I want to talk about in terms of acupuncture</p>
<p>is the incredible way in which acupuncture illuminates</p>
<p>the crosstalk between the somatosensory system,</p>
<p>our ability to feel stuff externally,</p>
<p>extroception, internally, interoception,</p>
<p>and how that somatosensory system is wired in with</p>
<p>and communicating with our autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>that regulates our levels of alertness or calmness.</p>
<p>After that, I&rsquo;m going to talk about how the acupuncture</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being done right now also points to relief</p>
<p>for what&rsquo;s called referred pain.</p>
<p>So this takes us all back to the homunculus.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start there.</p>
<p>We have this representation of our body surface</p>
<p>in our brain.</p>
<p>That representation is what we call somatotopic.</p>
<p>And what somatotopy is,</p>
<p>is it just means that areas of your body</p>
<p>that are near one another,</p>
<p>so your thumb and your forefinger, for instance,</p>
<p>are represented by neurons that are nearby each other</p>
<p>in the brain.</p>
<p>Now you might say, well, duh,</p>
<p>but actually it didn&rsquo;t have to be that way.</p>
<p>The neurons that represent the tip of my forefinger</p>
<p>and the neurons that represent my thumb on the same hand</p>
<p>could have been distantly located.</p>
<p>And therefore the map of my body surface,</p>
<p>the homunculus would be really disordered,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very ordered.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very smooth.</p>
<p>As let&rsquo;s say you were to image my brain,</p>
<p>if you were to stimulate my finger, my forefinger,</p>
<p>and then march that stimulation across my finger,</p>
<p>across the palm and to the nearby thumb,</p>
<p>you would see that neurons in the brain</p>
<p>would also make a sort of J shape</p>
<p>in their pattern of activation.</p>
<p>So that means they&rsquo;re so-called somatotopy.</p>
<p>But the connections from those brain neurons</p>
<p>are sent into the body and they are synchronized with,</p>
<p>meaning they cross wire with and form synapses</p>
<p>with some of the input from the viscera,</p>
<p>from our guts, from our diaphragm, from our stomach,</p>
<p>from our spleen, from our heart.</p>
<p>Our internal organs are sending information</p>
<p>up to this map in our brain of the body surface,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s about internal information,</p>
<p>what we call interoception,</p>
<p>our ability to look inside or imagine inside</p>
<p>and feel what we&rsquo;re feeling inside.</p>
<p>So the way to think about this accurately</p>
<p>is that our representation of ourself</p>
<p>is a representation of our internal workings,</p>
<p>our viscera, our guts, everything inside our skin,</p>
<p>and the surface of our skin,</p>
<p>and the external world, what we&rsquo;re seeing.</p>
<p>Those three things are always being combined</p>
<p>in a very interesting, complex, but very seamless way.</p>
<p>Acupuncture involves taking needles</p>
<p>and sometimes electricity and or heat as well,</p>
<p>and stimulating particular locations on the body.</p>
<p>And through these maps of stimulation</p>
<p>that have been developed over thousands of years,</p>
<p>mostly in Asia, but now this is a practice</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being done many places throughout the world,</p>
<p>they have these maps that speak to,</p>
<p>oh, well, if you stimulate this part of the body,</p>
<p>you get this response.</p>
<p>And if somebody has a gastrointestinal issue,</p>
<p>like their guts are moving too quick, they have diarrhea,</p>
<p>you stimulate this area</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll slow their gut motility down.</p>
<p>Or if their gut motility is too slow, they&rsquo;re constipated,</p>
<p>you stimulate someplace else</p>
<p>and it accelerates it.</p>
<p>And hearing about this stuff,</p>
<p>it sounds kind of to a Westerner</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s not thinking about the underlying neural circuitry,</p>
<p>it could sound kind of wacky.</p>
<p>It really sounds like alternative</p>
<p>or even kind of really out there kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But when you look at the neural circuitry,</p>
<p>the neuroanatomy, it really starts to make sense.</p>
<p>And Chufu Ma&rsquo;s lab at Harvard Medical School</p>
<p>is an excellent laboratory,</p>
<p>has been exploring how stimulation of different types,</p>
<p>intense or weak, with heat or without heat</p>
<p>on different parts of the body</p>
<p>can modulate pain and inflammation.</p>
<p>And what they&rsquo;ve shown in a particularly exciting study</p>
<p>is that stimulation of the abdomen,</p>
<p>anywhere on the midsection, weakly does nothing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not very interesting, you might say.</p>
<p>Intense stimulation of the abdomen, however,</p>
<p>with this electroacupuncture</p>
<p>has a very strong effect</p>
<p>of increasing inflammation in the body.</p>
<p>And this is important to understand</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just that stimulating the gut does this</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re activating the gut area,</p>
<p>it activates a particular nerve pathway.</p>
<p>For the aficionados,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the splenic spinal sympathetic axis,</p>
<p>if you really want to know,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s pro-inflammatory under most conditions.</p>
<p>However, there are other conditions</p>
<p>where if, for instance,</p>
<p>the person is dealing with a particular bacterial infection,</p>
<p>that can be beneficial.</p>
<p>And this goes back to a much earlier discussion</p>
<p>that we had on a previous podcast</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll revisit again and again,</p>
<p>which is that the stress response</p>
<p>was designed to combat infection.</p>
<p>So it turns out that there are certain patterns</p>
<p>of stimulation on the abdomen</p>
<p>that can actually liberate immune cells</p>
<p>from our immune organs like our spleen</p>
<p>and counter infection</p>
<p>through the release of things like adrenaline.</p>
<p>Chufu&rsquo;s lab also showed that stimulation</p>
<p>of the feet and hands can reduce inflammation.</p>
<p>And again, this was done mechanistically.</p>
<p>This was done by blocking certain pathways</p>
<p>with the appropriate control experiments.</p>
<p>This was done not in any kind of subjective way.</p>
<p>This was also done by measuring particular molecules,</p>
<p>IL-6 and cytokines and things that are related</p>
<p>to the inflammation response.</p>
<p>And what they showed is that the stimulation</p>
<p>in particular the hind limbs</p>
<p>at low intensity led to increases</p>
<p>in the activity of this vagal pathway,</p>
<p>the vagus nerve being this 10th cranial nerve</p>
<p>that serves the kind of rest and digest</p>
<p>and parasympathetic, in other words, calming response.</p>
<p>So what this means is that we are now at the front edge</p>
<p>of this research field that&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s early days still, but it&rsquo;s discovering</p>
<p>that depending on whether or not the stimulation</p>
<p>is intense or mild,</p>
<p>and depending on where the stimulation is done on the body,</p>
<p>you can get very different effects.</p>
<p>So this points to the idea that you can&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>acupuncture good or acupuncture bad.</p>
<p>There has to be a systematic understanding</p>
<p>of what exactly the effect is that you&rsquo;re trying to achieve.</p>
<p>And the underlying basis for this is really relevant</p>
<p>to the thing about adrenaline that I said before,</p>
<p>that in a fight, it&rsquo;s rare that you ever feel pain</p>
<p>when you get hit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve experienced that, but later it hurts a lot.</p>
<p>It turns out that when you stimulate these pathways</p>
<p>that activate in particular the adrenals,</p>
<p>the adrenal gland liberates norepinephrine and epinephrine,</p>
<p>and the brain does as well,</p>
<p>it binds to what are called</p>
<p>the beta noradrenergic receptors.</p>
<p>Okay, so this is really getting kind of down into the weeds,</p>
<p>but the beta noradrenergic receptors activate the spleen,</p>
<p>which liberate cells that combat infection,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s anti-inflammatory.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the short-term quick response.</p>
<p>The more intense stimulation of the abdomen</p>
<p>and other areas can be pro-inflammatory</p>
<p>because of the ways that they trigger certain loops</p>
<p>that go back to the brain</p>
<p>and trigger the sort of anxiety pathways,</p>
<p>and that place people into a state of anxiety</p>
<p>that exacerbates pain.</p>
<p>So one pathway stimulates norepinephrine and blunts pain,</p>
<p>the other one doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What does all this mean?</p>
<p>How are we supposed to put all of this together?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a paper that was published</p>
<p>in Nature Medicine in 2014.</p>
<p>This is an excellent journal</p>
<p>that describes how dopamine</p>
<p>can activate the vagus peripherally,</p>
<p>not dopamine in the brain, peripherally,</p>
<p>and norepinephrine can activate the vagus peripherally</p>
<p>and reduce inflammation.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not trying to throw a ton of facts at you,</p>
<p>say, well, what am I supposed to do</p>
<p>with all this information?</p>
<p>What this means is that there are real maps</p>
<p>of our body surface that, when stimulated,</p>
<p>communicate with our autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>the system that controls alertness or calmness,</p>
<p>and thereby releases either molecules</p>
<p>like norepinephrine and dopamine,</p>
<p>which make us more alert as we would be in a fight,</p>
<p>and blunt our response to pain,</p>
<p>and they reduce inflammation.</p>
<p>But there are yet other pathways</p>
<p>that, when stimulated, are pro-inflammatory.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the question</p>
<p>of what is all this inflammation stuff</p>
<p>that people are talking about?</p>
<p>One of the things that bothers me so much these days,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not easily irritated,</p>
<p>but what really bothers me</p>
<p>is when people are talking about inflammation</p>
<p>like inflammation is bad.</p>
<p>Inflammation is terrific.</p>
<p>Inflammation is the reason why cells</p>
<p>are called to the site of injury to clear it out.</p>
<p>Inflammation is what&rsquo;s going to allow you</p>
<p>to heal from any injury.</p>
<p>Chronic inflammation is bad,</p>
<p>but acute inflammation is absolutely essential.</p>
<p>Remember those kids that we talked about earlier</p>
<p>that have mutations in these receptors</p>
<p>for sensing pain?</p>
<p>They never get inflammation,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why their joints literally disintegrate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really horrible</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t actually have the inflammation response</p>
<p>because it was never triggered by the pain response.</p>
<p>So inflammation can be very beneficial.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of interest nowadays</p>
<p>in taking things and doing things to limit inflammation.</p>
<p>One of the ones that comes up a lot is turmeric.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the moment anyone starts talking</p>
<p>about inflammation,</p>
<p>the question is, what about turmeric?</p>
<p>I have talked before about turmeric elsewhere.</p>
<p>I am very skeptical of turmeric,</p>
<p>and I might lose a few friends,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;d be weird if my friend,</p>
<p>that would say something about my friendships</p>
<p>if I lost friends over a discussion about turmeric.</p>
<p>But in any case,</p>
<p>turmeric does have anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question about that.</p>
<p>But as we&rsquo;ve just described,</p>
<p>inflammation can be a very good thing,</p>
<p>at least in the short term.</p>
<p>The other thing about turmeric</p>
<p>is there was a study published out of Stanford</p>
<p>in collection with some work from other universities</p>
<p>showing that a lot of turmeric</p>
<p>is heavily contaminated with lead.</p>
<p>The lead is used to get that really rich, dense,</p>
<p>you know, orange coloring to it that everyone wants to see.</p>
<p>So you have to check your sources of turmeric.</p>
<p>The other thing is for men in particular,</p>
<p>turmeric can be very antagonistic to dihydrotestosterone.</p>
<p>Dihydrotestosterone is the more dominant form of androgen</p>
<p>in human males,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s involved in things like aggression</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Many people that I&rsquo;ve talked to who have taken turmeric</p>
<p>get a severe blunting of affect and libido.</p>
<p>So for some people that might be a serious negative.</p>
<p>I certainly avoid turmeric.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like turmeric for that reason.</p>
<p>I also think that the inflammation response</p>
<p>is a healthy response.</p>
<p>You have to keep it in check,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to talk about specific practices</p>
<p>for wound healing and injury in a moment.</p>
<p>But this idea that just inflammation is bad</p>
<p>and you want to reduce inflammation across the board,</p>
<p>nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>We have pathways that exist in our body</p>
<p>specifically to increase inflammation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the inflammation that goes unchecked just like stress,</p>
<p>which is problematic for repair from brain injury</p>
<p>and that can exacerbate certain forms of dementia, et cetera.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d like to create a little bit more nuance</p>
<p>or a lot more nuance if possible</p>
<p>in the conversation around inflammation,</p>
<p>because people have just taken this discussion</p>
<p>to be this idea that just inflammation is bad</p>
<p>and nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>Before I continue,</p>
<p>I just thought I&rsquo;d answer a question that I get a lot,</p>
<p>which is what about Wim Hof breathing?</p>
<p>I get asked about this a lot.</p>
<p>Wim Hof, also called AKA the Iceman,</p>
<p>has this breathing that&rsquo;s similar to TUMO breathing,</p>
<p>as it was originally called.</p>
<p>It involves basically hyperventilating</p>
<p>and then doing some exhales and some breath holds.</p>
<p>A couple of things about that,</p>
<p>it should never be done near water.</p>
<p>People who have done it near water,</p>
<p>unfortunately, have drowned.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly not for everybody</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not here to either promote it</p>
<p>nor discourage people from doing it.</p>
<p>But I think we should ask ourselves,</p>
<p>what is the net effect of that?</p>
<p>Because a number of people have asked me about it</p>
<p>in relation to pain management.</p>
<p>The effect of doing that kind of breathing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a mysterious effect,</p>
<p>it liberates adrenaline from the adrenals.</p>
<p>There is a paper published in the Proceedings</p>
<p>of the National Academy of Sciences,</p>
<p>which is a very fine journal,</p>
<p>showing that that breathing pattern</p>
<p>can counter infection from endotoxin.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because when you have adrenaline in your system</p>
<p>and when the spleen is very active,</p>
<p>that response is used to counter infection</p>
<p>and stress counters infection.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about this more going forward,</p>
<p>but the idea that stress lends itself to infection is false.</p>
<p>Stress counters infection</p>
<p>by liberating killer cells in the body.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want the stress response</p>
<p>to stay on indefinitely, however.</p>
<p>Things like Wim Hof breathing, like ice baths,</p>
<p>anything that releases adrenaline</p>
<p>will counter the infection.</p>
<p>But you want to regulate the duration</p>
<p>of that adrenaline response.</p>
<p>This should make perfect sense.</p>
<p>We, as a species, had to evolve</p>
<p>under conditions of famine and cold.</p>
<p>Actually, Texas right now is an extreme case</p>
<p>of cold and power outages.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the pictures</p>
<p>and there are a lot of people out there really suffering.</p>
<p>Their systems are releasing a ton of adrenaline.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re cold.</p>
<p>Some of them are likely to be hungry.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably stressed.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re releasing a lot of adrenaline,</p>
<p>which is keeping them safe from infection.</p>
<p>After they get their heat back on and they relax</p>
<p>and they can finally warm up again,</p>
<p>which we would like for them very soon,</p>
<p>hopefully by the time this podcast comes out,</p>
<p>that will have already happened,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s typically when people get sick</p>
<p>because the immune response is blunted</p>
<p>as the stress response starts to subside.</p>
<p>So stress, inflammation, countering infection</p>
<p>that comes from endotoxin,</p>
<p>that comes from any number of things,</p>
<p>can be from cold, it can be from hyperventilation,</p>
<p>it can be from a physical threat,</p>
<p>it can be from the stress of an exam or an upcoming surgery.</p>
<p>This adrenaline thing and the inflammation associated</p>
<p>with it is adaptive, it&rsquo;s highly adaptive.</p>
<p>It is a short-term plasticity that is designed</p>
<p>to make us better for what we&rsquo;re experiencing</p>
<p>and challenged with, not worse.</p>
<p>And so hopefully that will add an additional layer</p>
<p>to this whole idea that stress is bad,</p>
<p>inflammation is bad, et cetera.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not suggesting people do or don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>something like Wim Hof Tumor Breathing.</p>
<p>I just want to point to the utility.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very similar to the utility from cold showers,</p>
<p>ice baths, and other forms of anything</p>
<p>that increase adrenaline.</p>
<p>Every episode, I want to make sure</p>
<p>that every listener comes away</p>
<p>with as much knowledge as possible,</p>
<p>but also actionable tools.</p>
<p>And today we&rsquo;ve talked about a variety of tools,</p>
<p>but I want to center in on a particular sequence of tools</p>
<p>that hopefully you won&rsquo;t need,</p>
<p>but presumably if you&rsquo;re a human being and you&rsquo;re active,</p>
<p>you will need at some point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about managing injury and recovering and healing fast,</p>
<p>or at least as fast as possible.</p>
<p>It includes removing the pain,</p>
<p>it includes getting mobility back</p>
<p>and getting back to a normal life,</p>
<p>whatever that means for you.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that what I&rsquo;m about to talk about next</p>
<p>was developed in close consultation with Kelly Starrett,</p>
<p>who many of you probably have heard of before.</p>
<p>Kelly can be found at The Ready State.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a formally trained,</p>
<p>so degreed and educated exercise physiologist.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a world expert in movement</p>
<p>and tissue rehabilitation, et cetera.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not sponsors of the podcast.</p>
<p>Kelly is a friend and a colleague.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s somebody that I personally trust,</p>
<p>and his views on tissue rehabilitation and injury,</p>
<p>I think are really grounded extremely well</p>
<p>in both medicine, physiology,</p>
<p>and the real cutting edge of what&rsquo;s new</p>
<p>and what you might not get in terms of advice</p>
<p>from the typical person.</p>
<p>All that said, you always, always, always</p>
<p>should consult with your physician</p>
<p>before adopting any protocols or removing any protocols.</p>
<p>So I asked Kelly, I made it really simple.</p>
<p>I said, okay, let&rsquo;s say I were to sprain my ankle</p>
<p>or break my arm or injure my knee or ACL tear</p>
<p>or something like that, or shoulder injury.</p>
<p>What are the absolute necessary things to do</p>
<p>regardless of situation?</p>
<p>And what science is this grounded in?</p>
<p>And then I made it a point to go find the studies</p>
<p>that either supported or refuted what he was telling me,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>So the first one is a very basic one</p>
<p>that now you have a lot of information to act on,</p>
<p>which is in terms of what we know about tissue rehabilitation</p>
<p>in both brain and body, we know that sleep is essential.</p>
<p>And so we both agreed that eight hours minimum</p>
<p>in bed per night is critical.</p>
<p>Now, what was interesting, however,</p>
<p>is that it doesn&rsquo;t have to be eight hours of sleep.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that some of that time</p>
<p>might be challenging to get to sleep,</p>
<p>especially if one is in pain or mobility is limited.</p>
<p>You know, we forget how often we roll over in bed</p>
<p>or how the conditions of our sleeping</p>
<p>can impact those injuries too.</p>
<p>So Kelly acknowledged and I agree</p>
<p>that eight hours of sleep would be ideal,</p>
<p>but if not, at least eight hours immobile.</p>
<p>And that speaks to the power</p>
<p>of these non-sleep deep rest protocols too.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t sleep doing non-sleep deep rest protocols,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve provided links to them before.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to continue to provide links</p>
<p>to the previous ones and new ones are coming soon.</p>
<p>That is extremely beneficial.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a non-negotiable in terms of getting</p>
<p>the foundation for allowing for glymphatic clearance</p>
<p>and tissue clearance, et cetera.</p>
<p>The other is, if possible,</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s absolutely excruciating</p>
<p>when you just can&rsquo;t do it, a 10 minute walk per day.</p>
<p>Of course, you don&rsquo;t want to exacerbate the injury,</p>
<p>at least a 10 minute walk per day and probably longer.</p>
<p>This is where it gets interesting.</p>
<p>I was taught, I learned that when you injure yourself,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to ice something,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to put ice on it.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t realize this,</p>
<p>but when speaking to exercise physiologists</p>
<p>and some physicians,</p>
<p>they said that the ice is really more of a placebo.</p>
<p>It numbs the environment of the injury,</p>
<p>which is not surprising,</p>
<p>and will eliminate the pain for a short while,</p>
<p>but it has some negative effects</p>
<p>that perhaps offset its use.</p>
<p>One, it sludges, it creates sludging within the blood</p>
<p>and other lymphatic tissue.</p>
<p>So it actually can create some like clotting and sludging</p>
<p>of the tissue and fluids,</p>
<p>the fascial interface with muscle.</p>
<p>And a number of the stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s supposed to be flowing through there can slow up</p>
<p>and increase inflammation in the wrong way,</p>
<p>can actually restrict movement out of the injury site,</p>
<p>which is bad because you want the macrophages</p>
<p>and the other cell types, phagocytosing,</p>
<p>eating up the debris and injury</p>
<p>and moving it out of there so that it can repair.</p>
<p>So that was surprising to me,</p>
<p>which made me ask, well, then what about heat?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out heat is actually quite beneficial.</p>
<p>A lot of people talk about heat shock proteins</p>
<p>and all these genetic pathways and protein pathways</p>
<p>that can be activated by heat.</p>
<p>Very little data to support the idea</p>
<p>that heat shock proteins</p>
<p>are part of the wound healing process,</p>
<p>at least in terms of the sorts of conventional heat</p>
<p>that one could use like a hot water bottle</p>
<p>or a hot bath or a hot compress.</p>
<p>The major effects seem to be explained</p>
<p>by heat improving the viscosity of the tissues</p>
<p>and the clearance and the perfusion of fluid,</p>
<p>blood, lymph, and other fluids out of the injury area.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know this.</p>
<p>I thought, well, you&rsquo;re supposed to ice something.</p>
<p>I said, well, whenever I would like</p>
<p>see a kid get injured in soccer,</p>
<p>never me, of course, no.</p>
<p>Of course, I got injured in soccer from time to time.</p>
<p>They give you an ice pack</p>
<p>and the ice pack removes some of the pain.</p>
<p>I think the consensus now,</p>
<p>which was surprising to me,</p>
<p>is that the ice pack is actually</p>
<p>more of the top-down modulation.</p>
<p>You think you&rsquo;re doing something for the pain.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some interesting studies</p>
<p>that actually show the placebo effect of the ice pack.</p>
<p>So ice packs are placebo, perhaps.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll underline perhaps, because who knows,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s some people out there</p>
<p>that are going to say this is totally crazy</p>
<p>and the ice is actually very beneficial.</p>
<p>But it seems like heat, mobility, sleep, keeping movement.</p>
<p>And it turns out that the movement itself</p>
<p>can act as a bit of an analgesic.</p>
<p>It can actually reduce the pain.</p>
<p>Whereas the ice reduces the pain,</p>
<p>but sludges the tissue and keeps the cells</p>
<p>that need to be removed from leaving the area.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s also interesting is in neuroscience,</p>
<p>we know that if we want to kill neurons or silence neurons,</p>
<p>we cool them.</p>
<p>This is a well-known tool in the laboratory.</p>
<p>Some of the early and most important studies in neuroscience</p>
<p>that form the basis for the textbooks</p>
<p>were lowering a cooling probe</p>
<p>into a particular area of the brain or a peripheral nerve</p>
<p>in order to shut down that nerve.</p>
<p>So the cooling will shut down the nerve.</p>
<p>But other very well-known fact in neuroscience textbooks</p>
<p>is that when the activity of the nerve pathway</p>
<p>or neurons comes back,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called homeostatic plasticity</p>
<p>that it rebounds with greater pain,</p>
<p>with a higher level of intensity,</p>
<p>which in the pain system would equate to greater pain.</p>
<p>So regardless of where these neurons are in the body,</p>
<p>if you stimulate a neuron, it&rsquo;s active.</p>
<p>If you cool it, it becomes inactive.</p>
<p>And when the neuron heats back up after being cooled,</p>
<p>it becomes hyperactive.</p>
<p>And so this makes really good sense</p>
<p>as to why heat, provided it&rsquo;s not damaging levels of heat,</p>
<p>would be more beneficial for wound healing</p>
<p>and for reducing pain in the short and long run</p>
<p>than would be cold or ice, which I find very interesting.</p>
<p>Now, in terms of chronic pain,</p>
<p>the manuscripts on this,</p>
<p>my discussion with Kelly and with others,</p>
<p>point to the fact that chronic pain</p>
<p>is basically plasticity gone wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like PTSD for the emotional system</p>
<p>and the stress system.</p>
<p>And chronic pain is going to involve</p>
<p>a number of different protocols</p>
<p>to rewire both the brain centers</p>
<p>and the peripheral centers associated with chronic pain.</p>
<p>Certain things like fibromyalgia, for instance,</p>
<p>which is whole body pain,</p>
<p>relate to too little inhibition in the brain.</p>
<p>You have excitation and inhibition.</p>
<p>They come from different sources of neurons.</p>
<p>The inhibition is mainly from GABA</p>
<p>and glycine and things like that.</p>
<p>In fibromyalgia, there&rsquo;s too little central</p>
<p>within the brain modulation of the pain responses</p>
<p>so that people experience whole body pain.</p>
<p>So in that case,</p>
<p>the emerging therapies are really interesting.</p>
<p>I have a friend who works</p>
<p>for the National Institutes of Health</p>
<p>who unfortunately suffers from fibromyalgia</p>
<p>who asked me about this a lot.</p>
<p>And his question and what he&rsquo;s now actually exploring</p>
<p>is red light therapy,</p>
<p>something that I&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>on various Instagram posts.</p>
<p>Red light therapy typically is talked about</p>
<p>in terms of mitochondria.</p>
<p>And the data on that are not so terrific,</p>
<p>at least not really published</p>
<p>in blue ribbon journals in most cases,</p>
<p>except for one study that I&rsquo;m aware of</p>
<p>from Glenn Jeffrey&rsquo;s lab at University College London</p>
<p>showing that red light stimulation to the eyes</p>
<p>in people 40 or older</p>
<p>can offset some of the effects of macular degeneration</p>
<p>by improving the health of the photoreceptors.</p>
<p>People with fibromyalgia, which is this whole body pain,</p>
<p>are now starting to use red light therapies.</p>
<p>And I asked Kelly and others and some experts in pain,</p>
<p>what are your thoughts on this red light therapy</p>
<p>for things like fibromyalgia and pain,</p>
<p>especially red light local therapy?</p>
<p>Their idea, and I don&rsquo;t think this is a field</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s progressed far enough now</p>
<p>to really place any firm conclusions on,</p>
<p>but the idea is that red light therapy locally</p>
<p>may have some effect, but the systemic red light therapy,</p>
<p>this is like wearing protection to the eyes in some cases,</p>
<p>so not for the treatment of macular degeneration,</p>
<p>but wearing protection of the eyes</p>
<p>and getting very bright red light therapy,</p>
<p>in many ways may be, to use Kelly&rsquo;s words,</p>
<p>approximating the effects of nature.</p>
<p>These are like surrogate technologies</p>
<p>for getting outside in the sunshine.</p>
<p>You know, when you&rsquo;re in the sun, it might not look red,</p>
<p>but there are a lot of red wavelengths coming toward you.</p>
<p>So the red light therapies may have some utility,</p>
<p>but getting into sunlight</p>
<p>may actually have as much or more effect.</p>
<p>Of course, if these wounds are on a part of the body</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t expose,</p>
<p>then you could imagine why the red light therapy</p>
<p>might be good, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>depending on the neighborhood you live in,</p>
<p>that may or may not be a weird thing to go outside</p>
<p>and expose your body to sunlight.</p>
<p>Probably a number of factors that dictate</p>
<p>whether or not that&rsquo;d be weird or not,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s up to you, not me.</p>
<p>And it seems that, so movement, heat, not ice,</p>
<p>light, sleep, and in some cases, the use,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll talk about this in a moment,</p>
<p>some cases the use of restricting above and below the injury</p>
<p>to then release and then increase perfusion through the site</p>
<p>so may actually accelerate the wound healing.</p>
<p>So all of this might sound just like common sense knowledge,</p>
<p>but to me, at least as a 45-year-old,</p>
<p>I always just thought it&rsquo;s ice,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s things that block prostaglandins,</p>
<p>so things like aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen,</p>
<p>those things generally work by blocking things</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re called the Cox prostaglandin blockers</p>
<p>and things of that sort, things in that pathway.</p>
<p>Those sorts of treatments which reduce inflammation</p>
<p>may not be so great at the beginning</p>
<p>when you want inflammation,</p>
<p>they may be important for limiting pain</p>
<p>so people can be functional at all.</p>
<p>But the things that I talked about today</p>
<p>really are anchored in three principles.</p>
<p>One is that the inflammation response is a good one,</p>
<p>this is what we&rsquo;re learning from Chufu Ma&rsquo;s lab&rsquo;s</p>
<p>work on acupuncture,</p>
<p>the immediate acute inflammation response is good,</p>
<p>it calls to the site of injury,</p>
<p>things that are going to clean up the injury in bad cells.</p>
<p>Then there are going to be things</p>
<p>that are going to improve perfusion</p>
<p>like the glymphatic system, getting deep sleep,</p>
<p>feet elevated, sleeping on one side,</p>
<p>low level zone two cardio three times a week,</p>
<p>red light perhaps is going to be useful</p>
<p>although sunlight might be just as good</p>
<p>depending on who you talk to.</p>
<p>And we talk about that probably more at length</p>
<p>in a future episode.</p>
<p>A number of people will ask me I&rsquo;m sure about stem cells</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t want to take more of your time</p>
<p>by going into an hour long discussion about stem cells.</p>
<p>Stem cells exist in all of us during development,</p>
<p>we were created from stem cells</p>
<p>which are cells that can become essentially anything.</p>
<p>Later cells get what&rsquo;s called restricted in their lineage,</p>
<p>so a skin cell,</p>
<p>unless you do some fancy molecular gymnastics to it,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t actually turn that cell into a neuron.</p>
<p>Yamanaka won the Nobel Prize</p>
<p>for finding these Yamanaka factors</p>
<p>which you could give a skin cell to turn into a neuron</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not an approved therapy at this time.</p>
<p>But many people ask me about platelet-rich plasma,</p>
<p>so-called PRP.</p>
<p>They take blood, they enrich for platelets</p>
<p>and then they re-inject it back into people.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal, this deserves an entire episode.</p>
<p>It has never been shown whether or not the injection itself</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s actually creating the effect.</p>
<p>This is something that the acupuncture literature</p>
<p>suffered from for a long time,</p>
<p>that the sham control as it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>sham we don&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s a sham</p>
<p>but in science you say a sham control</p>
<p>meaning you do everything</p>
<p>that exactly the same way you would like.</p>
<p>So for acupuncture,</p>
<p>you would bring the needle right up to the skin</p>
<p>but you wouldn&rsquo;t actually poke it into the skin.</p>
<p>For instance, that would be a sham control.</p>
<p>With a drug treatment,</p>
<p>you would inject a drug into a person</p>
<p>and then the control, the sham control</p>
<p>would be that you would bring the injection over,</p>
<p>you might do the injection or not do the injection</p>
<p>because you imagine that the injection itself</p>
<p>could have an effect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never really been shown whether or not PRP</p>
<p>has effects that are separate</p>
<p>from injecting a volume of fluid into a tissue.</p>
<p>The claims that PRP actually contains stem cells</p>
<p>are very, very feeble.</p>
<p>And when you look at the literature</p>
<p>and you talk to anyone expert in the stem cell field,</p>
<p>they will tell you that the number of stem cells in PRP</p>
<p>is infinitesimally small.</p>
<p>In fact, so much so that these places that inject PRP</p>
<p>for injuries are not allowed to advertise</p>
<p>through the use of the words stem cells.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually illegal at this point,</p>
<p>at least as far as I know,</p>
<p>it was through the end of last year</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m guessing it still is now.</p>
<p>Stem cells are an exciting area of technology.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s a clinic down in Florida</p>
<p>that was shut down a couple of years ago</p>
<p>for injecting stem cells harvested from patients</p>
<p>into the eye for macular degeneration.</p>
<p>These were people that were suffering from poor vision</p>
<p>and very shortly after injecting these stem cells</p>
<p>into the eyes, they went completely blind.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m somebody who is very skeptical</p>
<p>of the stem cell treatment work that&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually very hard to get in the United States</p>
<p>for this reason, it&rsquo;s not approved.</p>
<p>The PRP treatments are very complicated.</p>
<p>The marketing around them is shaky at best.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure a number of people will say that they had PRP</p>
<p>and benefited from it tremendously and I don&rsquo;t doubt that.</p>
<p>Whether or not it was placebo,</p>
<p>today we talked a lot about top-down control,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a variant on the word placebo, belief effects.</p>
<p>Whether or not it was placebo or not, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t there, that&rsquo;s for you to decide.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not here to tell you that you should</p>
<p>or shouldn&rsquo;t do something,</p>
<p>but I do think that anything involving stem cells,</p>
<p>one should be very cautious of.</p>
<p>You should also be very cautious of anyone that tells you</p>
<p>that PRP is injecting a lot of stem cells.</p>
<p>This is an evolving area that really needs</p>
<p>a lot more work and attention.</p>
<p>The major issue with stem cells that I think is concerning</p>
<p>is that stem cells are cells</p>
<p>that want to become lots of different things,</p>
<p>not just the tissue that you&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<p>So if you damage your knee</p>
<p>and you inject stem cells into your knee,</p>
<p>you need to molecularly restrict those stem cells</p>
<p>so that they don&rsquo;t become tumor cells, right?</p>
<p>A tumor is a collection of stem cells, right?</p>
<p>So when you get something horrible</p>
<p>like glioblastoma in the brain,</p>
<p>which is a terrible thing to have,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s glial cells that returned to stemness,</p>
<p>excessive stemness,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve started to produce too many of themselves.</p>
<p>And glioblastoma is often deadly, not always.</p>
<p>So injecting stem cells, it sounds great,</p>
<p>and it sounds like something that one would want to do,</p>
<p>but one needs to approach this with extreme caution,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s your own blood</p>
<p>or stem cells that you&rsquo;re re-injecting.</p>
<p>I think those technologies are coming, they&rsquo;re on the way.</p>
<p>If any of you are devotees of PRP,</p>
<p>tell me your experiences with them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious, I want to see the papers,</p>
<p>I want to know the evidence.</p>
<p>And of course, there are always folks out there</p>
<p>that say, I don&rsquo;t care what the scientists</p>
<p>and the physicians and the FDA say, I just want to do this.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s your stance, that&rsquo;s your stance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not here to govern that,</p>
<p>but I do think that people should be informed.</p>
<p>And in thinking about tissue recovery and injury,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I was able to glean.</p>
<p>Again, check out what Kelly and his coworkers are doing</p>
<p>at the Ready State, it&rsquo;s phenomenal.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve worked with all the top people</p>
<p>just about every domain of life, it seems,</p>
<p>very high integrity folks.</p>
<p>Some of you are probably saying, well, I&rsquo;m not injured,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an athlete, I don&rsquo;t want stem cell injections.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have, again, I think you shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get stem cell injections for now.</p>
<p>Please hold off until the field learns more</p>
<p>about how to do that safely.</p>
<p>But I want to talk about and end with a really interesting</p>
<p>and somewhat weird technology, which is baby blood.</p>
<p>I have a colleague at Stanford,</p>
<p>his name is Tony Weiss-Corey.</p>
<p>And in 2014, his laboratory published a study</p>
<p>showing that the blood of young rodents, mice and rats,</p>
<p>when transfused into old demented rodents, mice and rats,</p>
<p>made those old demented rodents recover much of their memory</p>
<p>and seem much more vital and energetic,</p>
<p>better recall of different spatial learning tasks,</p>
<p>tissue and wound healing they&rsquo;ve since shown</p>
<p>can be improved in these older animals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty incredible.</p>
<p>They went on to show several years later</p>
<p>that blood from umbilical cords, I&rsquo;m not making this up,</p>
<p>blood from umbilical cords can do the same.</p>
<p>And this is the basis of a biotech company.</p>
<p>Actually, one of my former postdocs</p>
<p>is now an employee there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve isolated the molecules from young blood</p>
<p>that seems to vitalize or revitalize the old brain</p>
<p>and body and one of those molecules</p>
<p>goes by the name TMP2, T-I-M-P-2.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s all this going?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know how long it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>before there are treatments</p>
<p>based on these blood transfusions.</p>
<p>I doubt that blood transfusions themselves</p>
<p>from young people into old people</p>
<p>is going to be used for the treatment of dementia,</p>
<p>although it might.</p>
<p>As weird as it seems,</p>
<p>we know that transfusions of all sorts of stuff,</p>
<p>for instance, fecal transplants</p>
<p>are being used to treat obesity.</p>
<p>The gut microbiome of thin people is being,</p>
<p>not transfused, but is being transplanted</p>
<p>into the colons and guts of obese people</p>
<p>and leading to weight loss,</p>
<p>which sounds really wild</p>
<p>and is not a topic I particularly enjoy talking about.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, it points to the importance</p>
<p>of the gut microbiome in regulating things</p>
<p>like blood sugar and health</p>
<p>as it relates to obesity and diabetes</p>
<p>and all sorts of things.</p>
<p>So it does appear that there are things,</p>
<p>factors in the blood of young members of a given species</p>
<p>that are lost over time</p>
<p>in the older members of that species.</p>
<p>I am not going to give you a tool</p>
<p>on the basis of these findings today.</p>
<p>I am not going to tell you to consume any fluid</p>
<p>from any other member of your species, our species,</p>
<p>for any reason.</p>
<p>But I do think that it&rsquo;s important to mention</p>
<p>that the science is asking questions</p>
<p>such as what are the factors within the brain</p>
<p>that allow the young brain to recover so much better</p>
<p>than the older brain from injury,</p>
<p>from all sorts of things, events, et cetera.</p>
<p>And what are the factors in the older brain</p>
<p>that are limiting?</p>
<p>And thinking about identifying which factors</p>
<p>are going to allow people to restore cognitive function,</p>
<p>physical function, wound healing, and so forth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really exciting area.</p>
<p>I mention it not to be sensationalist,</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>and because there&rsquo;s a lot of excitement about it.</p>
<p>And because I think it&rsquo;s clear</p>
<p>that the young brain and body and blood</p>
<p>are very different from the old brain, body, and blood.</p>
<p>And the goal of science is to identify</p>
<p>and isolate those factors that make that so,</p>
<p>such that people who would otherwise get dementia</p>
<p>or perhaps even have dementia will be allowed to recover.</p>
<p>Again, not an actionable item at this point,</p>
<p>but one to think about, perhaps not too long,</p>
<p>but one to think about.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to close there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about a lot of tools today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked a lot about somatosensation,</p>
<p>about plasticity, about pain, about acupuncture,</p>
<p>some of the nuance of acupuncture, inflammation, stress.</p>
<p>We even talked a little bit about high intensity breathing,</p>
<p>talked about restricting limb movement</p>
<p>to get compensatory regrowth of pathways,</p>
<p>or I should say reactivation of pathways</p>
<p>that have been injured or damaged.</p>
<p>So as always, we take kind of a whirlwind tour</p>
<p>through a given topic, lay down some tools as we go,</p>
<p>hopefully the principles that relate to pain and injury,</p>
<p>but also neuroplasticity in general</p>
<p>today in the context of the somatosensory system</p>
<p>will be of use to all of you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wish injury on any of you,</p>
<p>but I do hope that you&rsquo;ll take this information to mind</p>
<p>and that you will think about it</p>
<p>if ever you find yourself in a situation</p>
<p>where you have to ask,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the difference between my perception</p>
<p>and the actual tissue damage?</p>
<p>Is injury and pain, is it the same?</p>
<p>Well, no.</p>
<p>Do I have some control over my experience of pain?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Does all of that involve taking drugs</p>
<p>or doing certain therapeutics?</p>
<p>No, not necessarily.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an incredible subjective component.</p>
<p>There also is a need sometimes to treat the injury</p>
<p>at the level of the pain receptors at the site of the wound.</p>
<p>So please take the information, do with it what you will.</p>
<p>And in the meantime,</p>
<p>thank you so much for your time and attention.</p>
