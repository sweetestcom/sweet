<p>Call him daddy.</p>
<p>Do I call her daddy?</p>
<p>Call her daddy.</p>
<p>Daddy&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>Welcome back, guys.</p>
<p>It is call her daddy.</p>
<p>0:21</p>
<p>Who sex on the first date?</p>
<p>Oh Sophia.</p>
<p>Sex on the first day.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all done it Robin.</p>
<p>This podcast is called call her daddy.</p>
<p>So if you want to fuck on a first date fuck on a first date, absolutely.</p>
<p>0:38</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you agree 100%?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve said that in past episodes if you guys want to fuck fuck.</p>
<p>Freely, I&rsquo;ve been there.</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s passion you guys have chemistry.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re vibing.</p>
<p>Things are getting hot and heavy, you both want to do it, do it with that said, with people that sad, you gotta be prepared for pottered your father.</p>
<p>1:02</p>
<p>We go, Sofia, you gotta be prepared.</p>
<p>To never hear from this guy ever again.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just the tea.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the T says.</p>
<p>Well, I think you and I I&rsquo;ve talked about that people right in there.</p>
<p>Like holy shit.</p>
<p>1:17</p>
<p>I got ghosted.</p>
<p>I fucked this guy in the first date.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so upset.</p>
<p>Listen.</p>
<p>I think what we want to emphasize is that there is a chance, even if you didn&rsquo;t fuck him on the first date, he was going to ghost you.</p>
<p>Anyways, and so, it&rsquo;s hard for girls sometimes because would you be more?</p>
<p>1:36</p>
<p>But her if you walked away from that date, you hadn&rsquo;t fucked him.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, alright, I&rsquo;ll chalk it up as a loss.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s ghosting me, but girls get way more.</p>
<p>But her being like, I fucking Spread my legs open.</p>
<p>He entered me.</p>
<p>He fucked me.</p>
<p>And now he&rsquo;s never gonna talk to me again.</p>
<p>Makes the stakes just way highway higher.</p>
<p>1:51</p>
<p>If he doesn&rsquo;t talk to you and you guys had not done anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier to brush that off.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Basically, you almost fucked my, your ego might hurt a little.</p>
<p>But the, the moral of it is that you&rsquo;ll never really know if it was because you fucked or because you didn&rsquo;t have, so that&rsquo;s hard to.</p>
<p>2:08</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, move on from this is a really interesting topic because Alex, and I have talked about Out this, our backgrounds with that.</p>
<p>Yes, so different.</p>
<p>Well, I know, I think also just when we tell you guys this think about yourself to think about your past because I think everyone has different situations with how it goes.</p>
<p>2:27</p>
<p>If they fuck on a first date.</p>
<p>It also depends on the guy, but just read your audience and read your path.</p>
<p>Like what works and doesn&rsquo;t work for you.</p>
<p>Me personally, and my experiences, I would say my last three boyfriend&rsquo;s, my last three serious relationships.</p>
<p>It started off us partying, okay?</p>
<p>2:44</p>
<p>And raging together and then finally, like one night we hook up and then I mean maybe we like continually hook up.</p>
<p>But after that then we&rsquo;re like wait, we really like each other.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go on a date.</p>
<p>Oh my face.</p>
<p>Know what I&rsquo;m saying that like, okay.</p>
<p>3:00</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;ve already entered me but like let&rsquo;s get to know each other over this candlelit dinner.</p>
<p>Would you?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, hi we fucked and now it&rsquo;s time for some sushi.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s appropriate.</p>
<p>But I mean no.</p>
<p>And and that&rsquo;s we always talk about how we&rsquo;re we are a little different.</p>
<p>Current.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so similar in so many aspects of life, but this specifically is just a little different for both of us, because so that&rsquo;s happened for Sophia.</p>
<p>3:22</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how a lot of your long-term relationships have started from partying than hooking up.</p>
<p>I am completely different.</p>
<p>Most of my longer term relationships have started where like I start texting a guy and then we start hanging out and then eventually will fuck and my whole thing and listen, like a way I make them.</p>
<p>3:43</p>
<p>Wait, And within this has nothing to do with being like a Holy Roller being like, I&rsquo;m saving my shit for marriage.</p>
<p>No, okay, just I&rsquo;m not saving myself for marriage.</p>
<p>4:00</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay, but no, so I basically have this thing that I&rsquo;ve been doing since College.</p>
<p>I remember my best friend&rsquo;s brother told me and her or not before we went to college.</p>
<p>I do not hook up with someone, your first Simon semester of college, and I took that shit to heart.</p>
<p>4:19</p>
<p>And now, to this day, I still use it because this is, this is what I do.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t for my game.</p>
<p>Personally.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to give it up.</p>
<p>I like to make them work for it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a fucking tease, but I never have sex with them in, like, the first month, to two months.</p>
<p>4:36</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t make him wait a month or two.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Are you doing other stuff?</p>
<p>Sofia?</p>
<p>Of course?</p>
<p>What is the Cooper&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>Not if I don&rsquo;t but it to you.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so like for example, I absolutely in getting some PP in my mouth, but I&rsquo;m not, but I&rsquo;m not letting it go in the v and that&rsquo;s just an again.</p>
<p>4:57</p>
<p>I want to confirm, I&rsquo;m not judging any girls that are giving it up on the first night.</p>
<p>Mine&rsquo;s not about being like I don&rsquo;t want to let him have it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally me being like, I know this shit works when I make a guy, wait the longer I make awake.</p>
<p>He just keeps coming back and coming back and then that gives me the Opportunity in that timeframe to basically get him obsessed with me.</p>
<p>5:19</p>
<p>So then that when we do fuck I basically have full control of whether I want to take it to dating.</p>
<p>I want to keep fucking not very calculating.</p>
<p>I am so goddamn.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, we&rsquo;re drunk.</p>
<p>5:35</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hook up.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Um, but for I also think it&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>And that I am hooking up with these guys.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not fucking being a prude where they&rsquo;re like, this girl&rsquo;s the most boring bitch to hook up with.</p>
<p>5:53</p>
<p>I am getting his dick wet just specifically with my mouth and he&rsquo;s going down.</p>
<p>Okay, but with that said, you don&rsquo;t want to pull out all the fucking stock.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was going like that.</p>
<p>Like when you&rsquo;re hooking up with a guy for the first time.</p>
<p>6:11</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to pull out your Lisa Ann.</p>
<p>ERM it.</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t deserve that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we&rsquo;ve said this a million times you can have great sex without being a total freak.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Listen girls.</p>
<p>There is just this double standard and it&rsquo;s like every single time.</p>
<p>6:26</p>
<p>A girl goes to hook up with a guy, the for the first time.</p>
<p>If you perform like a nasty-ass freak in the bedroom, he it may love it.</p>
<p>But afterwards he&rsquo;s going to go up to his friends and be like they&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>Like, how was it?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like amazing fuck.</p>
<p>6:43</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s See as shit.</p>
<p>And then their mind yet.</p>
<p>I could never date her because they associate with nasty with having experience in being a slot, which is really fucked up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because so fucked up, honestly, like they&rsquo;re judging you.</p>
<p>Like if you do a great performance, they&rsquo;re just automatically thinking like she must get around.</p>
<p>7:01</p>
<p>Yeah, fuck material.</p>
<p>Fuck you.</p>
<p>Maybe I watch a lot of fucking porn and my vibrator is my best goddamn friend.</p>
<p>Yes, and I go to town on myself.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll write a lot of pent-up actual energy, but we just keep it.</p>
<p>Real you guys.</p>
<p>So that is a possibility.</p>
<p>7:16</p>
<p>So with that said, if you really, really like this guy, then don&rsquo;t give him your grade a performance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll save a little stuff for down the road, but girls do not lay there.</p>
<p>Like a dead fish.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get it twisted or they listen to call her.</p>
<p>Daddy.</p>
<p>Alex.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not laying there like a dead.</p>
<p>7:32</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Because go ahead.</p>
<p>I was just gonna say from my perspective, if I felt like I wanted to pull out all the stops on the first time and the guy like Joe.</p>
<p>Me for it.</p>
<p>I also would be like well, then he&rsquo;s not the guy for me.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, fuck all like different ways to look.</p>
<p>7:48</p>
<p>We what was that?</p>
<p>Girl that wrote in to us and she was like I went to this guy&rsquo;s house and he fucked me and then but I didn&rsquo;t come.</p>
<p>And what did she say?</p>
<p>She said that she liked.</p>
<p>Oh, and he said you never.</p>
<p>He said, you don&rsquo;t call me daddy, like, when were fucking and after they fucked, like, she grabbed up all of her shit and she was like, you are not Daddy.</p>
<p>8:10</p>
<p>I am Daddy and I am not here to make you come.</p>
<p>Um, yes.</p>
<p>Or something like that.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re here too.</p>
<p>You should be here to make me kind Le and walk out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>This girl needs to come on our podcast.</p>
<p>We fucking love that shit.</p>
<p>So back to the whole thing guys.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re hooking up will girls if you&rsquo;re hooking up with a guy on the first date, go fucking into it.</p>
<p>8:29</p>
<p>Give him a grade like seven performance, but don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t know, maybe go crazy.</p>
<p>That reminds me of the glove clock.</p>
<p>This is something I wanted to confirm about the GLOCK GLOCK.</p>
<p>I know ladies, I gave you the double hand twist.</p>
<p>Alka combo or getting sloppy.</p>
<p>8:46</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting noises.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting eye contact.</p>
<p>Double hands going different ways.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>This is what I do though, and I want to make sure you guys start doing this to, and I apologize if that it&rsquo;s taken me this long to realize, I didn&rsquo;t tell you guys this, I don&rsquo;t ever give the guy the GLOCK GLOCK nine thousand.</p>
<p>9:04</p>
<p>The first time we&rsquo;re hooking up fucking never because you don&rsquo;t want to use all of your ammo in the first go-round.</p>
<p>I agree like a magic because then what, you know what I mean, so what I do is I always the guy that I always talk about male x3000.</p>
<p>9:22</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe not even a 3000.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the preview to the Glock.</p>
<p>Le so I always text my friend after I&rsquo;m like, yeah give him head and he&rsquo;s like, what was your performance?</p>
<p>And usually on the first, this is so fucked up.</p>
<p>Usually, on the first time I give a guy head, I will go in and I personally label it, like a grade 6 in my repertoire.</p>
<p>9:41</p>
<p>That would be a stick.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an above-average.</p>
<p>Everyone else is It&rsquo;s wire.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fucking stop 20.</p>
<p>So no, so I give a guy a blowjob and it&rsquo;s a 6 which means that shit was an above-average blowjob for sure.</p>
<p>I would never walk away being like, oh, fuck.</p>
<p>9:56</p>
<p>I could have sucked it better.</p>
<p>No, I live there with feeling confident, but there are in my mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh my God, I have this, I can bring in, I didn&rsquo;t even double hand twist, his shit.</p>
<p>The sloppiness wasn&rsquo;t even disgusting, like, you know, you build up to build.</p>
<p>10:13</p>
<p>It up because then if it&rsquo;s an above-average, they&rsquo;re like holy shit.</p>
<p>This girl knows how to fucking suck dick, but also, they&rsquo;re not like that was the nastiest fucking thing that like, she looks like a Porn Star by your fifth day.</p>
<p>When you whip that shit out there.</p>
<p>Like, Okay, so let&rsquo;s get married, because holy shit.</p>
<p>10:30</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in love and it just almost looks like you are trying new things on him, little do they fucking know you&rsquo;ve been able to do it the whole time?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just fucking holding out.</p>
<p>I mean, brought to you by the minds of Alex, Cooper.</p>
<p>The fucking mind.</p>
<p>Fuck that shit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really brilliant.</p>
<p>10:46</p>
<p>I want to say guys.</p>
<p>This does not pertain to you know, this does not pertain to you every single time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in the bedroom.</p>
<p>You need to be pulling out all the stops, giving them your 100%.</p>
<p>Yes, Sofia, you don&rsquo;t get a say, I&rsquo;m gonna like make this girl.</p>
<p>11:03</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to give her all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to press too hard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna throw in two different positions know because Sofia, you and I were both saying that it&rsquo;s like and like We know I was going to say we were both about to come in here being like, all right, like what?</p>
<p>What can we tell guys?</p>
<p>11:18</p>
<p>For the rule fucking on the first date?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t fucking apply to God.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>What guy on a first day is like trying to like give the girl to build up and not pull out all the stops and he&rsquo;s like, let me just go down on you.</p>
<p>Yeah, no sex.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let me sexy.</p>
<p>11:34</p>
<p>You know, I do my dick in there.</p>
<p>Also, we didn&rsquo;t even want to tell guys if they should have sex on the first date or not.</p>
<p>Alex like you just said because what guy and they&rsquo;re It mind goes on a date with a girl and the girl is ready to spread her legs.</p>
<p>And he turns it down and he&rsquo;s not ready to spread.</p>
<p>11:50</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s just not the right time.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m not ready.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on my Myriad.</p>
<p>Like, what the fuck, like what can they say?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no excuse.</p>
<p>And so, I just think also, for guys being mindful.</p>
<p>You better be pulling out your fucking stallion performance every single time because like we&rsquo;ve talked about in previous episodes, there are gdrs and there are be.</p>
<p>12:11</p>
<p>DRS, gdr equals a good day.</p>
<p>Each review and a BD R equals a bad dick review and if you do not perform your first night and make her fucking wetter than anything and make her fucking calm or at least attempt to, she&rsquo;s going back to all of her home girls and she&rsquo;s like that guy.</p>
<p>12:28</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t fuck.</p>
<p>So fucking pull out all your stuff.</p>
<p>I mean coming back from a bdr, is nearly impossible.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve said, but doesn&rsquo;t that fucking suck it?</p>
<p>Like guys, just get to go full, ramping it up every goddamn time and we&rsquo;re over here.</p>
<p>Like, okay, so I&rsquo;m gonna give him the six and then next Be seven and a half and then all of these games, these don&rsquo;t apply when you&rsquo;re older.</p>
<p>12:49</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s for like people in their 20s and in college and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Even Alex and I are approaching an age where no one in their 40s and 50s is like, okay, so I&rsquo;m going to go on the date with him, but I&rsquo;m gonna hold out.</p>
<p>Like they don&rsquo;t have time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like God going on the day and if it&rsquo;s going, well, we&rsquo;re fucking or moving on.</p>
<p>13:06</p>
<p>Yeah, we everyone we talked to that tonight age from there.</p>
<p>Like if I&rsquo;m wasting my Saturday or my Thursday to go on a date with this guy.</p>
<p>Guy.</p>
<p>If I like him, I&rsquo;m fucking him.</p>
<p>And if I don&rsquo;t we know so many people that are like, I will leave after appetizers and be like, you&rsquo;re a great guy.</p>
<p>13:22</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think the chemistry is there and they bounce exact.</p>
<p>But we know that our demographic also, like a lot of you could be in college and that is such a different scene guys because it&rsquo;s like you maybe fucking someone and then you know that like, oh fuck.</p>
<p>If I fuck them on the first date, they&rsquo;re friends with this person and that social.</p>
<p>13:39</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s only so many more layers to it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I even feel like we&rsquo;re approaching an age where like Like, that&rsquo;s sad.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess we will be doing a lot of fucking on a first date.</p>
<p>Oh, PS a&ndash;.</p>
<p>But we just, we&rsquo;re just saying, fuck on.</p>
<p>The first date of you want but don&rsquo;t get fucking nasty with it now.</p>
<p>13:56</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t like get on the bed naked and like dangle your head off the bed and be like, come stick your dick in my mouth and like, fuck my throat.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I know eyes till I pass.</p>
<p>You preferably.</p>
<p>There is no, there is no face fucking going on a first date.</p>
<p>14:12</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s fucking face. us, fucking Can we talk about the effects?</p>
<p>Go fucking face fucking throat?</p>
<p>Fucking God.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so beautiful.</p>
<p>They are, that is what that is.</p>
<p>What we love here at call her daddy.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at talk about face fucking so well, actually, I feel like a lot of girls in the daddy gang have reached out to us and said, guys, I don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>14:36</p>
<p>I have such a bad gag reflex and like, they&rsquo;re like brushing their teeth and they like almost throw up there.</p>
<p>Like sticking their toothbrush, back to try to Practice for that night and they end up hurling off.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been there brushing the back of my tongue and I&rsquo;m like, well, I won&rsquo;t be doing any time soon.</p>
<p>14:54</p>
<p>So with that being said, listen, face-fucking is like not for everyone.</p>
<p>So, like I&rsquo;m not on here like girls get into guys.</p>
<p>Like I know some guys are just not in in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But so face-fucking, let&rsquo;s talk about phase fucking because I have a position.</p>
<p>15:11</p>
<p>I want to talk about that.</p>
<p>I think is really, really good for Girls and really good for guys.</p>
<p>So you just mentioned the head over the bed, which is not it, but we can talk about that in a minute.</p>
<p>Okay, girls, Envision yourself laying on your back, like you&rsquo;re going to sleep and you get him on top of you and you pull him up basically to your face, like as if your, when you let go and they say, like, oh, sit on my face.</p>
<p>15:37</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s basically sitting on it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important that you have a pillow behind your head.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be completely flat on a mattress.</p>
<p>If so, your heads on the pillow, the guys on top of you and his dick goes in your mouth.</p>
<p>Okay, right.</p>
<p>15:53</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>I figured it would go in the mouth.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>So once he&rsquo;s in there, this is why I love this position.</p>
<p>You are going to have your head up a little bit where you got your neck.</p>
<p>It could get cramped a little bit so you can go back and forth off the pillow a little bit, but you raise your head a little bit off the pillow and he&rsquo;s going to start face-fucking you basically, but you&rsquo;re going to put your hands on the Of his thighs.</p>
<p>16:16</p>
<p>So to him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like holy shit.</p>
<p>She wants to take all of me.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s so hot and you&rsquo;re basically going to control his rhythm of the thrust.</p>
<p>And that way.</p>
<p>This is a position.</p>
<p>You can really fucking, almost throw up like your gag reflex.</p>
<p>16:32</p>
<p>Is because the angle.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>So, what you want to do is with your hands, on the back of his thighs, you are almost, he&rsquo;s gonna think it&rsquo;s so hot because you&rsquo;re taking control of his speed.</p>
<p>But at the same time, your Most helping yourself out because you&rsquo;re controlling it the minute you feel guys.</p>
<p>16:50</p>
<p>Like you are like holy fuck.</p>
<p>I cannot take this thing anymore.</p>
<p>I am out of breath.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t breathe.</p>
<p>Know your limits.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;ve been there before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh my God, if I don&rsquo;t like chill for a second like, get my hands in volume.</p>
<p>17:07</p>
<p>Start turning blue.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m turning blue.</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>I go.</p>
<p>Throwing up like, I Girls have gotten 0400 throwing up on the day.</p>
<p>Well, and I was going to say it happens.</p>
<p>And so when you&rsquo;re doing this you need to be prepared like okay girls while your thrusting him forward, the best thing to do why I&rsquo;m telling you to have the pillow, is the minute you feel that you could possibly gag.</p>
<p>17:35</p>
<p>You pull your head back to the pillow so that you pull out of his dick AKA.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I told you if you were on the flat mattress, you&rsquo;re fucked.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a little getting some potato.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So have that little So make sure you back up.</p>
<p>And then what&rsquo;s going to happen is you will start licking the side of his peace, go down to his balls like start licking the tip and this is the position girls.</p>
<p>17:59</p>
<p>I know, sometimes we say don&rsquo;t always keep eye contact, disposition is 100% eye contact when a guy is looking down at you and he sees his whole fucking dick in your mouth and that position like seeing your eyes looking up at him and add, it&rsquo;s like a banana.</p>
<p>18:15</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s so hot to him, guys.</p>
<p>You listen.</p>
<p>You just need to make sure that you are taking it in certain ways and you are stopping when you&rsquo;re ready and a guy is gonna freak the fuck out and the more sloppy you can get with it better any blow job, but try this position just be mindful is could throw up.</p>
<p>18:35</p>
<p>I was thinking about the position where you like lay flat on the bed with like on your back and you have your head dangling off.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then that is like an actual Facebook.</p>
<p>I wear like you literally.</p>
<p>Just hang your mouth, open like this.</p>
<p>But like, literally I had, I was like down like Spider-Man kiss, except you&rsquo;re kissing.</p>
<p>18:54</p>
<p>Is Dick?</p>
<p>Your kissing is wiener instead and like that, like, you can actually pass out and because that&rsquo;s a full full fucking situation.</p>
<p>I was going to say that is like I personally don&rsquo;t like that position for girls because you at that very moment, ladies lose all control really?</p>
<p>19:11</p>
<p>You like he&rsquo;s actually fucking your face and you can&rsquo;t pull away.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re gonna go like you have no.</p>
<p>You have no room.</p>
<p>Ankle left.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re stuck.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re taking your a gag.</p>
<p>That is when you throw up on a day that is when you throw up on a dick, which is so common.</p>
<p>19:29</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I want to tell everyone.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>So common and guys are like, ooh, it&rsquo;s so gross and I&rsquo;m like it can happen.</p>
<p>If she&rsquo;s trying to deep throat you like an animal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when you&rsquo;re having anal right, like you might get poop on your dick and that&rsquo;s to be the Risk, you&rsquo;re willing to take because you&rsquo;re trying to fuck her up killer - fuck her throat.</p>
<p>19:50</p>
<p>Like some throw up.</p>
<p>Might come out but it is.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s discussed.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re talking to my friend.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re talking to me.</p>

<p>26:57</p>
<p>That the apartment I was living in was not a normal, New York City Apartment.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t have the rug that Sophia and I expect, there&rsquo;s no ruggedness.</p>
<p>There was no poop and pee coming out of their bathroom when it was just it was a way nicer.</p>
<p>It was like a museum.</p>
<p>Yeah, how would you explain it was like It was like borderline Penthouse.</p>
<p>27:16</p>
<p>You just is high-rise gorgeous apartment.</p>
<p>The views were incredible of all time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like no 20 something year old girl is a can afford to live in that.</p>
<p>There was no fucking way.</p>
<p>I was, that was just my place.</p>
<p>So the guy comes up, we walk into the apartment and he like stops in his tracks and he&rsquo;s like what the fuck he was like, do you guys live here?</p>
<p>27:38</p>
<p>And I remember being like, yes, it&rsquo;s like our place just two of us.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, meanwhile this Decoration in my apartment at the time.</p>
<p>The memorabilia like there were like 12 pictures of your ex boyfriend, like jerseys, like it wasn&rsquo;t like it was literally a museum of all of this like athletic shit, right?</p>
<p>27:58</p>
<p>I probably looked like a fucking great.</p>
<p>A psychopath like bad.</p>
<p>Like the biggest fan.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, I just I just love sports.</p>
<p>So anyways, so he sees it whatever.</p>
<p>We ended up saying it was our place.</p>
<p>They go into the bedroom and the guys shoes and clothes were.</p>
<p>Yeah, the way they&rsquo;re like, why do you have all these men&rsquo;s clothes?</p>
<p>28:14</p>
<p>That I dress like a boy.</p>
<p>Okay, so they go and they fuck.</p>
<p>In the morning, I&rsquo;m sound asleep in my bed.</p>
<p>And my friend comes in.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, knock on door.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like alcoholics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like what?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like I need to come in.</p>
<p>She closes the door.</p>
<p>She locks it.</p>
<p>She gets into bed.</p>
<p>28:29</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s naked.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what the fuck is going on.</p>
<p>Like, what did he do?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like nothing.</p>
<p>It was unbelievable.</p>
<p>Great sex, but I just don&rsquo;t want to see him again.</p>
<p>And I was like, wait what?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, I do not want to see this man again, and I&rsquo;m like, okay, but what the fuck dude?</p>
<p>28:45</p>
<p>Like this guy&rsquo;s in our apartment.</p>

<p>And I said, thanks for last night.</p>
<p>Sorry, but I need to be alone right now.</p>
<p>You can let yourself out and then she left her number at the bottom.</p>
<p>29:02</p>
<p>And didn&rsquo;t she put it on his head?</p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t she do that?</p>
<p>She put the Post-it note on his forehead and left him in the bedroom and came in here.</p>
<p>Honestly, it&rsquo;s not that crazy.</p>
<p>Because if you want, if you need to make sure that this I seized the Post-it note, like, world are going to put it on his day.</p>
<p>29:21</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>She was like, he better know beforehand who let himself out.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;re laying there and we were freaking out though, because we hear him get up and he opens the door.</p>
<p>We hear him walking around the apartment.</p>
<p>At this point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like this bitch is about to steal everything.</p>
<p>Like this guy is just having a shopping spree.</p>
<p>29:38</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s walking out with so Jersey.</p>

<p>So Well, the best part of this story, you guys, this man wrote in to call her daddy a couple weeks ago, a year later your later.</p>
<p>29:59</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting in my bed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>I was in.</p>
<p>So it turns out he did know, he knew he knew God.</p>
<p>He did know, he fucking knew if you went into that apartment, you would know.</p>
<p>So then he said, funniest part was I woke up alone completely naked with a Post-It note.</p>
<p>No on my head saying that the girl needed to be alone and went into the other room to pass out to top it off.</p>
<p>30:54</p>
<p>She only gave me six digits.</p>
<p>This leads me to my question.</p>

<p>I was kind of hooking up with a few months ago and he we were, I wouldn&rsquo;t say we&rsquo;re about to start like dating but we were More serious, and so I I don&rsquo;t know why the fuck I did it, but I stayed over one night.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s buying me enough, dinners.</p>
<p>You, taking me out enough.</p>
<p>I got to sleep over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a slumber party.</p>
<p>So I sleep there and I don&rsquo;t sleep a fucking minute guys.</p>
<p>I am laying there, like, the little mummy in my casket.</p>
<p>33:10</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like dead to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like counting the hours, and checking my phone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at he sleeping.</p>
<p>So I remembered you were the one day.</p>
<p>I texted you and I&rsquo;m like Sophia.</p>
<p>I am losing my fucking mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 6 a.m.</p>
<p>I need to get the fuck out of here.</p>
<p>Alex text me and she&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re gonna call me and you&rsquo;re going to say you&rsquo;re locked out of the apartment and I&rsquo;m an answer the phone so I can leave.</p>
<p>33:31</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t even text her back.</p>
<p>I was like, hey Alex, I&rsquo;m locked out of the apartment wanna come by me while I put my phone directly next to that motherfucker&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Head put it on loud.</p>
<p>And so it goes off and he&rsquo;s like, oh and I&rsquo;m like, oh my god.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s phone is a pretending like I didn&rsquo;t know goddamn well, I just fucking texted you and blow me up and that&rsquo;s the type of shit.</p>
<p>33:51</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think guys would never know.</p>
<p>Girls do that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, oh my God, there is nothing more irritating than when you&rsquo;re laying there and the guy is sound asleep and you know that you will not be able to go to sleep.</p>
<p>Like it pisses me off on a level that is not normal for something.</p>
<p>34:09</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so natural to happen.</p>
<p>Why do girls do this?</p>
<p>And not guys girls?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s just Sophie and I like it&rsquo;s every girl we need attention.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>To be asleep until I&rsquo;m excited.</p>
<p>Oh my God, if I am like laying there and I look over and he is sound asleep.</p>
<p>34:24</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s making that little peaceful face.</p>
<p>I want to fucking punch in the bed.</p>
<p>Like this is, here you go.</p>
<p>Sofia, I used to do this with my ex-boyfriend.</p>
<p>Like I would do the classic like, kind of like smacking a little bit.</p>
<p>34:40</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s like his nose, like do stuff.</p>
<p>So he would like, be like, what?</p>
<p>What, like, whatever to wake him up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not enough.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Enough never.</p>
<p>And so, what I started to do, Jesus Christ, what here she comes.</p>
<p>Guys, gonna bring it.</p>
<p>34:56</p>
<p>I would be like, babe, babe, babe.</p>
<p>I just heard a noise like I&rsquo;m terrified.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s someone downstairs.</p>
<p>It was so scary.</p>
<p>Like, please, please go check on him.</p>
<p>He would be like, babe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asleep.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s funny, please please.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, oh my God, please.</p>
<p>35:17</p>
<p>So he would And up so good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stairs.</p>
<p>Like look around and so by the time he&rsquo;s back up to our room.</p>
<p>He had gotten up, was walking around the house and he&rsquo;s awake and he&rsquo;s got them awake and you did and it will take it way longer to fall back asleep.</p>
<p>35:35</p>
<p>Then if you just like, did a little slap, your they need.</p>
<p>What do you have to want to watch a movie when I tell you board game?</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you&rsquo;re awake.</p>
<p>I like me too.</p>
<p>Well, I couldn&rsquo;t fall asleep either.</p>
<p>Like, what should we do is post show?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like no guys.</p>
<p>That is the thing.</p>
<p>You have to get them to stand up.</p>
<p>35:52</p>
<p>That have to stand up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be fun.</p>
<p>Babe.</p>
<p>I heard a noise babe.</p>
<p>Someone&rsquo;s in the house.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>They ought to make him do a lap.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re invited back to the room.</p>
<p>They are awake and you&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;ve told my boyfriend said that he started to get cozy here.</p>
<p>36:08</p>
<p>This is fucked up.</p>
<p>He said he started to get really bad anxiety.</p>
<p>Falling asleep around was Because he knew how bad it pissed me off.</p>
<p>Like he said that he would fall asleep.</p>
<p>And like after he&rsquo;d been asleep for like 1 to 2 minutes, like he would like hurry.</p>
<p>36:25</p>
<p>And like look over.</p>
<p>And I would just like these laying there like staring it Sophia.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the crazy.</p>
<p>Not easy.</p>
<p>No, we like we came.</p>
<p>We like came to the middle.</p>
<p>You would just probably before him.</p>
<p>I love you just decided that the best thing for the both of us was for me to fall asleep first.</p>
<p>36:43</p>
<p>And then he could fall asleep.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what relationships are all about, finding some Middle Ground.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we did doing and guys are going to be listening to them and be like, what the fuck?</p>
<p>Probably guys, don&rsquo;t understand the things girls do when we fucking lay there?</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s like a one-night stand or you just don&rsquo;t want to be there and you are bringing you a whole nother level.</p>
<p>37:00</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m not comfortable with a guy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Audi.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>I literally play on The Uber before we hook up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, here we go.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s off.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but that I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s as bad as in full-on nude.</p>
<p>Oh, sending a nude that shit.</p>
<p>Oh, can you imagine sending a full-blown vid?</p>
<p>A little lace vide?</p>
<p>38:42</p>
<p>I hop in the car and up an option.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re popping the cliff.</p>
<p>Okay, I am so sorry hiding it.</p>
<p>Thank you for riding in that shit.</p>
<p>Is I&rsquo;m so sorry about that situation.</p>
<p>All right, the next one.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m cooking with this guy.</p>
<p>38:58</p>
<p>He throws a condom on he starts thrusting.</p>
<p>I was a bit confused at his over exaggerated moans because his dick was underneath me in between my sheets and my ass, I wasn&rsquo;t sure what he was going for, but I just went for it with a minute for a minute and then he fucking came in my sheets shortly after and he told me my pussy was tight, really?</p>
<p>39:21</p>
<p>He was fucking railing.</p>
<p>My nylon bed sheets.</p>
<p>What the fuck?</p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p>She goes He panicked right after because the condom broke implying he thought he was inside me for that short ride.</p>
<p>What the fuck?</p>
<p>If you are listening to this podcast they call her daddy podcast and you don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re in a vagina or if you&rsquo;re in between her ass in a bedsheet go home.</p>
<p>39:46</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>What guys listen to something else?</p>
<p>Fuck this feels so good.</p>
<p>Babe.</p>
<p>This fucking pussy is so tight.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re fucking my sheet.</p>
<p>I would just want Fuck with and be like, I think I&rsquo;m pregnant but I&rsquo;m pregnant.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not good news for you about the condom breaking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, dude.</p>
<p>Oh my fucking idiot, dude.</p>
<p>40:04</p>
<p>Okay, hang on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to give that guy a second of our time unless he&rsquo;s like in middle school or high school.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah.</p>
<p>Wait, what age is this?</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>Okay, Sofia go.</p>
<p>Okay, this girl wrote and she said what is your advice if you&rsquo;ve been fucking a guy for about a month casually and now you&rsquo;re over it and don&rsquo;t want to fuck anymore.</p>
<p>40:22</p>
<p>Do you say you&rsquo;re over it or goes the fuck out of him?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Oh, Oh my God, so many curls right into us, and they&rsquo;re like, hey, like I&rsquo;ve been doing this with this guy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of over it.</p>
<p>Like, what do I do?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, why?</p>
<p>Is that a question you?</p>
<p>40:38</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>You ghost the fuck out of you literally leave.</p>
<p>He never hears from you again.</p>
<p>Guys.</p>
<p>Why do you care?</p>
<p>This is the thing, I think girls over think some things way too much.</p>
<p>There is no approach unless you&rsquo;re in a full-blown dating relationship.</p>
<p>There is no appropriate way to be like, hey, we&rsquo;ve fucked.</p>
<p>40:56</p>
<p>Times.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s my time to escape a and I&rsquo;m over it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go find new dick.</p>
<p>Thank you for your services.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Thank you for the orgasms, but it&rsquo;s time for me to find a new day.</p>
<p>We right.</p>
<p>No, I mean totally if it&rsquo;s boyfriend girlfriend, that&rsquo;s obviously if you guys are fuck buddies you do not owe him anything.</p>
<p>41:14</p>
<p>I mean, if you don&rsquo;t want to be such a dick, I think also the best way to do it is just slowly stopped answering and I can kind of ghost in then you kind of don&rsquo;t and your responses are just Bland as fuck and you always blow off the plan.</p>
<p>I will get Get the hint.</p>
<p>But I do want to also address that we acknowledge.</p>
<p>41:30</p>
<p>There are some people that are in like college settings or group settings.</p>
<p>I get, it&rsquo;s a little bit harder.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re fucking with a guy that&rsquo;s like in your friend group because you don&rsquo;t want to ruin a relationship or like split up the group and I think that more so is what we just said.</p>
<p>Start kind of like weaning off and just almost be like, yeah, like well, I think everyone&rsquo;s going out tonight.</p>
<p>41:46</p>
<p>We can hang out there and then just don&rsquo;t go home with him and just literally Wayne off the fucking.</p>
<p>But girls, if you again, if you&rsquo;re done be fucking done, just like guys.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean guys, what can do it all the time?</p>
<p>Girls in, we start ghosting, you goddamn daddy.</p>
<p>Well, this may be one of the only podcast telling people to go.</p>
<p>42:04</p>
<p>So, what that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Go last question.</p>
<p>How do I tell my boyfriend that he&rsquo;s not good at eating me out?</p>
<p>Oh, so first, we got to bring up the couch cobbler.</p>
<p>We gotta bring up the couch gobbling on the couch bubble.</p>
<p>Gum, baby in episode 5.</p>
<p>42:22</p>
<p>If you can have him, listen to it with you.</p>
<p>Without his feelings getting hurt.</p>
<p>I say go for it.</p>
<p>This is how you don&rsquo;t get his feelings hurt.</p>
<p>God.</p>
<p>You blame everything on call her daddy.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re going to do is you&rsquo;re gonna say, holy shit.</p>
<p>Babe.</p>
<p>I am listening to this podcast and this there a couple episodes one.</p>
<p>42:42</p>
<p>I have so many things.</p>
<p>I want to try on you for a blow job.</p>
<p>I found this new technique, but there is this shit.</p>
<p>I want you to try on me.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be so fucking hot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so horny.</p>
<p>I want you to listen to it and lets you try it on me tonight.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Like a positive.</p>
<p>Horsemen like excited, you gotta approach everything, basically mind, fucking them.</p>
<p>43:01</p>
<p>If you want to tell them something, you bring it, positive.</p>
<p>Your nice about it and you&rsquo;re like this couch, cobbler.</p>
<p>Babe, you doing on me?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even fucking him out.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;s gonna be like, oh my God, my girlfriend&rsquo;s wet over this podcast.</p>
<p>Listen, I&rsquo;ve only dated guys where they wanted me to tell them what I like.</p>
<p>43:18</p>
<p>Like they wanted me to literally tell them verbatim.</p>
<p>Like what I want to go did that on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve told you I know, but I guess there are guys out there.</p>
<p>Get their egos bruised.</p>
<p>I had a guy friend that was never really, like wanted to go down on girls what that he was just kind of fucking because he said, I know I&rsquo;m great at fucking I know my go-to positions but eating a girl out is something I&rsquo;m not as confident in and so I kind of strayed away from it and I think listen guys have a lot of guys and their egos get bruised, so easily especially when it comes to sexual things.</p>
<p>43:49</p>
<p>So girls, if you want to tell your guys something you can&rsquo;t be so direct with them because imagine if your do You fucking suck at giving head.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s not what anyone wants to hear a sexual shit because then what happens is the minute, he then goes down on you.</p>
<p>The next time he&rsquo;s insecure thinking.</p>
<p>44:05</p>
<p>Oh my God, it does.</p>
<p>She think this one sucks v+?</p>
<p>They want to switch it up and try something, and blaming a call her daddy and show them episode 5, the couch cobbler combo.</p>
<p>I mean, baby.</p>
<p>That shit is real and you will be wetter than ever, guys.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Another Wednesday down, daddy game.</p>
<p>44:23</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s December.</p>
<p>Oh, oh my God.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting close to New Year&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many episodes.</p>
<p>We have coming up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much content.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>Thank you guys for listening to this episode.</p>
<p>We love you guys.</p>

<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Daddy game.</p>
