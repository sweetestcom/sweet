    <p>Hi friends, this week we&rsquo;re gonna talk about why you&rsquo;re a miserable fuck, okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna start off the podcast like that. Oh, you know, we&rsquo;re just gonna go with it. Okay, I&rsquo;m not refilming this intro. Hi</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna share my three little theories I have on</p>
<p>happiness and why people are unhappy, you know, like people always talk about</p>
<p>Comparison is the thief of joy eat my ass. That&rsquo;s some kindergarten shit. Okay, we&rsquo;re gonna get into my like deep little theories</p>
<p>you know, they seem real simple, but</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re real helpful. I promise I promise a whole bunch and I am gonna go ahead and call out before somebody tries to give me</p>
<p>shit</p>
<p>One is its own thing two and three are a little bit contradictory</p>
<p>but kind of not and my third little tip theory is</p>
<p>Kind of like a trick for anxiety too. So</p>
<p>This episode is gonna be real helpful. It&rsquo;s gonna be real real helpful</p>
<p>So get your little notebook out bitch take some notes because I&rsquo;m about to rock you and I&rsquo;m not gonna be mean this week</p>
<p>This one&rsquo;s actually gonna be like a nice win. Like last week. I attacked the fuck out of you this week. I&rsquo;m gonna help you</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s kick Sunday service off. All right, my first little theory why you&rsquo;re not happy</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s because a lot of people spend time</p>
<p>Trying to not do shit</p>
<p>Let me explain that sounds real dumb they try to stop caring</p>
<p>About someone or something they try to stop loving somebody they try to stop doing things that they realize are damaging or bad</p>
<p>So basically just trying to not do shit because that is resistance as fuck</p>
<p>so what people don&rsquo;t realize about trying to not do things is</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t actually stop wanting to do them. So</p>
<p>If you have a desire, you can&rsquo;t not want it. Whatever you want you want. You can&rsquo;t make yourself unwanted</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t even fucking try what you can do is try to figure out why you want it</p>
<p>If you look at if you want to stop caring about something</p>
<p>Why do you want to stop caring if you look at loving someone? I don&rsquo;t want to love them anymore</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna stop loving them. How do I stop loving them? Stop looking at that look at why you don&rsquo;t want to love them</p>
<p>Why are you scared to continue loving them? Also ask yourself? What feelings am I trying to avoid?</p>
<p>What feeling states do I not want to feel</p>
<p>Get clear on what you don&rsquo;t want to feel and then look at what is that making you realize you do want to feel instead</p>
<p>What feeling states do you want to feel because most of the times?</p>
<p>The shit you&rsquo;re doing is trying to get to that</p>
<p>but you need to be clear and become aware of what you&rsquo;re actually trying to get to instead of just shooting in the fucking dark and</p>
<p>The same thing goes for if you keep doing shit that you know, you shouldn&rsquo;t be doing</p>
<p>Just look at why do you keep doing them?</p>
<p>Stop going at yourself with the attitude of like judging yourself as bad or wrong the fact that I care. No, it&rsquo;s bad</p>
<p>I want to stop doing it the fact that I keep doing these damaging behaviors or sabotaging behaviors. No, it&rsquo;s bad</p>
<p>I have to stop doing it. Stop looking at it like it&rsquo;s fucking bad because everything you do is serving you in some way</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a need being met even the self sabotaging shit. There&rsquo;s a reason you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>So look at yourself with an attitude of trying to understand why you&rsquo;re doing what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first fucking step</p>
<p>Stop with the judging stop with that. That will never get you anywhere like you&rsquo;re just gonna keep going in a cycle of</p>
<p>Okay, I need to stop doing this and then putting energy in to stop doing it. You know, that&rsquo;s resistance</p>
<p>You need to learn how to</p>
<p>Pull the anchor out of the fucking ocean before you try and drive your ship or you&rsquo;re not gonna fucking go nowhere</p>
<p>Okay, so when you pull up that resistance then you can get somewhere</p>
<p>So when you look at why do I keep doing this damaging behavior?</p>
<p>You can see how this thing was benefiting you and then you can find another way to get that need met. Does that make sense?</p>
<p>the same thing with caring all</p>
<p>The awareness you need to truly make changes and to truly stop caring is in the middle of what you&rsquo;re trying to run</p>
<p>From you have to go into it. You have to try to understand it</p>
<p>You have to face it before you can fucking get away from it. The only way out is through</p>
<p>okay, so quit trying to run from it and go the fuck into it and</p>
<p>I think this is a big contributor to unhappiness because people are trying to run from shit</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re trying to not care you&rsquo;re trying to force yourself to not do whatever it is. You want to stop doing that&rsquo;s annoying</p>
<p>Like because you constantly are just like judging yourself and beating yourself up mentally for everything you&rsquo;re doing and thinking</p>
<p>Feeling and you can&rsquo;t control the way that you feel. So</p>
<p>Stop with the judgment. Stop with the fucking bullshit. It&rsquo;s making you miserable a</p>
<p>perfect example of this is someone that</p>
<p>Wants to be successful, but they don&rsquo;t believe that they can actually be successful</p>
<p>So they try to convince theirself what they want is to stop wanting success</p>
<p>So once you have a desire for something, you can&rsquo;t get rid of it</p>
<p>Okay, so if you want to be successful, you can&rsquo;t stop wanting to be successful. You&rsquo;re fucked</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing you can do about that. If you want it you want it. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with wanting things</p>
<p>But if you feel the urge to want to stop wanting success look at why?</p>
<p>Why do you want to stop wanting success?</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s gonna prevent you from being heartbroken when you never achieve it?</p>
<p>You have to look at why you don&rsquo;t want to want it. What are you scared of?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>You gotta face that shit</p>
<p>So you got to get really real with yourself and you got to be brutally honest and that&rsquo;s one thing</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great about being honest with yourself is nobody has to fucking know you are safe in your own mind</p>
<p>You can think whatever you want to think no one&rsquo;s there to judge it</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s there to nothing like if you&rsquo;re safe in your own fucking mind. Okay, so you have to get really honest with yourself and</p>
<p>Face all this shit because if you just spend your whole life trying to stop wanting success, you&rsquo;re not gonna get anywhere</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never gonna stop wanting success and you&rsquo;re never gonna get successful</p>
<p>If you keep trying to not want it all your energy is gonna be spent in the wrong fucking direction and you&rsquo;re gonna get nowhere</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my first little theory and belief on</p>
<p>Why you&rsquo;re not happy. Okay. Did you like it?</p>
<p>Okay, so number two I&rsquo;m gonna get vulnerable and I&rsquo;m gonna tell you all straight the fuck up what I was dealing with and I</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t care if you judge me. I don&rsquo;t care if you get mad. This is a safe space. God damn it</p>
<p>Okay, this is my fucking podcast leave me alone</p>
<p>so my second little theory of why people aren&rsquo;t happy is</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have meaning like they don&rsquo;t have a why for the shit that they&rsquo;re doing and let me elaborate because that sounds real stupid</p>
<p>Right. Okay. Hang on</p>
<p>so what I was dealing with is I</p>
<p>was creating tick tocks and I was making this podcast and I was trying to just like keep consistent with it and</p>
<p>Then it started to get really fucking draining like I was like, there&rsquo;s no point behind it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not making fucking money. So I was looking at it like it&rsquo;s a waste like I&rsquo;m posting tick tocks for what?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a fuck to get famous. I don&rsquo;t give a fuck to get more followers. I have plenty like that&rsquo;s fine my podcast</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s doing good. I&rsquo;m getting like 10,000 listeners an episode like that makes my fucking heart happy. I&rsquo;m like, yeah, okay cool</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m like, okay what now, you know posting the podcast like for what?</p>
<p>Posting my fucking tick tocks on my life coach and my other account like for what posting on Instagram for what I felt like my</p>
<p>Time that I spent posting on social media and creating all these things was for nothing. I can&rsquo;t really fathom of how</p>
<p>Much I&rsquo;m helping people</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to realize it because a lot of y&rsquo;all are messaging me and saying that like the shit that I&rsquo;m saying is changing your</p>
<p>fucking lives and that is</p>
<p>Like hard for me to accept because I have my own kind of like beliefs and shit about being worthless and</p>
<p>Whatever, but I&rsquo;m slowly starting to realize that I&rsquo;m benefiting people and I&rsquo;m helping people and I&rsquo;m like, whoa</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s only fun for so long. Like I&rsquo;m a selfish prick. Like what the fuck do I get out of it?</p>
<p>Like yeah, it&rsquo;s all fun and games like help people but like I was getting drained with it</p>
<p>I was getting drained with the podcast. I was getting drained with the tick tocks. I&rsquo;m just getting bored</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m not making money at it</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see myself making money from this and the near or foreseeable future and I&rsquo;m tired of fucking doing shit where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>The outcome is promised later. Nah, bitch. I need some fucking instant shit. I need something that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>Now I need something like quick cuz I&rsquo;m tired of just having to have faith that shit&rsquo;s gonna work out</p>
<p>No, I want to see some fucking results now. I&rsquo;m sick of this shit. I&rsquo;m sick of putting it out in the future</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all down for</p>
<p>Doing what needs to be done and you can&rsquo;t expect instant gratification</p>
<p>I get that but nothing in my life has been instant gratification like jerking off. That&rsquo;s all I fucking get</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s all I fucking get is jerking off is that&rsquo;s my instant gratification</p>
<p>Even going to a music festival thing. I got a plan the shit months in advance. I got a drive there</p>
<p>I got a no no nothing</p>
<p>This is like a little rant, you know, but just I that&rsquo;s where I was looking at it</p>
<p>I was like, what am I posting this shit for? Like I don&rsquo;t want more followers. I don&rsquo;t see myself making money from this. So</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m bored. I&rsquo;m over it</p>
<p>Like it was taking so much energy from me to do this shit for a couple of weeks and then I was like, okay</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a realization about to come out of this shit and</p>
<p>It basically was that I had no meaning I felt like I was working toward nothing</p>
<p>So I sat down and I was like Leo look fucker. What do you want to do?</p>
<p>Like I needed to make a goal for myself and incorporate</p>
<p>Posting and shit into it so I could feel like it was worth the fuck. So I was like Leo</p>
<p>What do you want to do?</p>
<p>So I decided I wanted to get my life coach</p>
<p>Certification and start doing one-on-one zoom calls with people with like advice or whatever the fuck I can help you on if you need</p>
<p>To talk about shit if we need a new perspective</p>
<p>Whatever you need. I just want to start doing one-on-one</p>
<p>Zoom meetings with people and talking to people directly and</p>
<p>Seeing the impact that I have on them because making a podcast is cute and fun short</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not getting to live the results. I&rsquo;m not getting to like see the benefit that any of this could be having</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m just hearing about it, but it&rsquo;s different to experience it</p>
<p>So I want to be talking to someone and see their fucking face light up with what I just helped them realize</p>
<p>Like I want to interact</p>
<p>I want to see this shit and I feel like I have so much to offer and I could offer people a lot of</p>
<p>One-on-one basis, you know, so I decided okay. I&rsquo;m going to in</p>
<p>May start working toward getting my life coach certification because for the next two months</p>
<p>I have a lot of shit going on and it&rsquo;s just not a good timing. So I</p>
<p>Was like, okay. So Leo if you&rsquo;re gonna do the fucking life coach thing my life coach Leo tick-tock</p>
<p>I was like get consistent on it and grow that</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>Now making tick tocks you can make the content you can share what you know</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like free advertising like people will want to talk to me</p>
<p>Once they see how my brain works and once they see the knowledge that I have to offer</p>
<p>So with this podcast, it&rsquo;s like now I feel I need to keep making it. I need to talk about more and more shit</p>
<p>I need to talk about wanting to be a life coach on it. So people know that&rsquo;s gonna be a thing</p>
<p>So now when I go to make a podcast, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>Energized by it again. I&rsquo;m excited because my new goal is</p>
<p>To become a life coach and to start working with people one-on-one. I&rsquo;m still gonna do my tick tocks</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still gonna do my</p>
<p>Podcast and shit, but I&rsquo;m just saying that&rsquo;s my new goal. So now I feel energized by</p>
<p>doing the things</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s gonna help me meet that goal</p>
<p>So making my podcast is gonna help me reach more people and that&rsquo;s gonna help my goal of becoming a life coach</p>
<p>Same with making tick tocks now, I&rsquo;m excited to make them now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited and I&rsquo;m always thinking of ideas of like new shit to talk about and I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of lives on</p>
<p>life coach Leo and just giving people live advice and people are fucking loving it and</p>
<p>Getting to interact with people like one-on-one, even though it&rsquo;s just their messages like to get live feedback as I&rsquo;m talking to them</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so fucking nice and I&rsquo;m loving it. But to do that shit takes no energy. Now. I&rsquo;m energized</p>
<p>By making tick tocks by doing my podcast because I feel like it&rsquo;s gonna help me achieve my goal of</p>
<p>Being a life coach</p>
<p>So all I really did was assign meaning to what I was doing</p>
<p>Like I have a new outlook on what I&rsquo;m doing and now I feel energized by it and happy with it</p>
<p>instead of drained by it because when I was looking at it from the perspective of</p>
<p>This is fucking pointless like for what like there&rsquo;s no use in it</p>
<p>I was kind of drained by it like sure it was fun here and there</p>
<p>But to get consistent felt like a fucking drag and to like put a schedule on it</p>
<p>I was like you like fucking know like it&rsquo;s fun when I want to do it</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m gonna leave it as that but as soon as I looked at it from the perspective of this could help me achieve</p>
<p>something I&rsquo;m instantly like</p>
<p>Excited to do it. I&rsquo;m happy to fucking do it now</p>
<p>I feel like I have fucking meaning in my life because I&rsquo;m not just making random fucking tick tocks in a stupid little podcast</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like working toward</p>
<p>Something does that make sense?</p>
<p>This has helped me a ton and it just came from switching one perspective and like setting one goal</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not doing anything different. It&rsquo;s just in my brain the way I&rsquo;m looking at it</p>
<p>That has completely changed the way I feel about it</p>
<p>So the main thing to look out with this is when something is like draining you of energy or it&rsquo;s sucking your fucking energy and</p>
<p>Shit just seems like harder than it should</p>
<p>Look at why you feel drained. What are you telling yourself about what you&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the reason you feel drained when I was looking at this shit like it was pointless</p>
<p>It drained me when I was looking at it like it was helping me get to where I wanted to go now</p>
<p>I feel energized</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good thing for people to follow when you don&rsquo;t feel in touch with the way that you feel</p>
<p>Follow what gives you energy and what makes you feel drained? Okay, look at that shit. That&rsquo;s better than if I tell you</p>
<p>Well, how does this make you feel if you&rsquo;re cut off from your emotions like I was for a long time</p>
<p>You have nothing to follow like your emotions are your guidance</p>
<p>But when you can&rsquo;t feel them because you learn to cut off from them or there you&rsquo;re like detached from them</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have anything. So look at your energy. Look at your energy in your body. What makes you feel tired?</p>
<p>What makes you feel energized because one day I was so fucking tired</p>
<p>And I wanted to go take a nap and I thought about doing a live</p>
<p>So I jumped on live and I talked on live for like two hours with people and I felt so fucking energized</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t need no more nap. I didn&rsquo;t even think about a coffee like I didn&rsquo;t need anything. So that&rsquo;s one tip</p>
<p>I have for people that can&rsquo;t really feel their emotions</p>
<p>If you want help doing this</p>
<p>I have the app positive focus and there&rsquo;s an entire section of journal prompts full of questions to ask yourself on</p>
<p>Different topics different areas of life for shit like this to gain awareness to flip your perspective</p>
<p>Everything you need really to get started with this and to develop yourself and to switch your fucking mindset is in that app. So</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re like, oh this might not even work</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking at the topics a lot of the questions inside the different topics are more universal. It&rsquo;s just under one thing</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll be a lot more helpful than you realize and you can apply these questions to different areas of your life</p>
<p>You just got to switch a couple words around if you want</p>
<p>But I think they&rsquo;re very fucking helpful and a lot of you guys have found them helpful</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m throwing that out for the resource for people that don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put the link to download it in the description of this podcast</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on iPhones androids all the fucking shit in between</p>
<p>So yeah, if you want help and this is like sparking your interest, but you don&rsquo;t know where to start cuz that shit&rsquo;s overwhelming</p>
<p>I get it. That&rsquo;s why I made an app for it. I got you, babe</p>
<p>Let go get it go discover yourself go change your life cuz like I said, it just takes</p>
<p>Switching one perspective to completely change the way you feel about what you&rsquo;re doing and how you&rsquo;re living</p>
<p>Again, the app is called positive focus. If you just want to search it in the App Store. It&rsquo;s the blue eyeball</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the icon. So</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s also linked in the description. Love you. I had to plug that really quick just cuz it&rsquo;s a helpful resource</p>
<p>Okay, so my last theory for this</p>
<p>happiness topic that everybody won&rsquo;t shut the fuck up about</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kidding</p>
<p>Do y&rsquo;all know when I&rsquo;m kidding?</p>
<p>Cuz I feel like people don&rsquo;t really know when I&rsquo;m joking versus when I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>But I just want everyone to know if I&rsquo;m ever dead-ass serious</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll know like whenever I&rsquo;m actually aggravated. I&rsquo;m actually talking shit</p>
<p>You will 100% know you will without you will have no doubt that maybe I was joking</p>
<p>Okay, if I say some off-the-wall shit, I&rsquo;m probably kidding</p>
<p>Most of the time if you get me you get me, okay, whatever so back to the third thing</p>
<p>You got to get in the fucking moment with shit, and I&rsquo;m not talking about all that mindfulness fucking meditation</p>
<p>Bullshit that everybody preaches online that you need to meditate. You need to practice being mindful. Shut the fuck up. I</p>
<p>Have a brain that does not shut up with thoughts. Okay, 24 hours a day</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have one second when my brain is not thinking a fucking thought I can&rsquo;t meditate doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>I either fall asleep or I think about too much shit</p>
<p>Like I can&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ve tried it like I really have but it just doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>I sit still a lot and I&rsquo;ll just like pay attention of a sensation to my body</p>
<p>But girl to meditate no can&rsquo;t do it. Fuck you</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m not talking about that when I say get in the moment</p>
<p>But my counselor a long time ago told me a couple of things that do help, but this is not what I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to get to my point, but I need to throw you these couple tips</p>
<p>So I was asking her like how do I get more in the moment?</p>
<p>And she said Leo feel your ass in the chair</p>
<p>Love you at least if you ever listen to this, but she said feel your ass in the chair when you&rsquo;re in the moment</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re at a restaurant feel your butt in the chair get in the environment feel the weather</p>
<p>Feel like the sensation of your skin</p>
<p>What is the temperature in the room feel the cold on the glass when you pick up your cup to drink?</p>
<p>Like just feel how it feels to be in your body and to be doing what you&rsquo;re doing in that moment</p>
<p>And it will bring you back to the moment</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something that helps people with anxiety too, but my point with the whole get in the moment shit is</p>
<p>Stop doing things</p>
<p>so that and</p>
<p>what I mean by so that is</p>
<p>For an example for me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to the gym so that I can look good so that I can be healthy so that I can X Y fucking Z</p>
<p>Stop with the so that I&rsquo;m going to the gym</p>
<p>Period that&rsquo;s it. I&rsquo;m going to the gym if I decide okay</p>
<p>I want to look good, so I&rsquo;m gonna start going to the gym</p>
<p>Okay, the reason I&rsquo;m going to the gym is because I want to look good, but I don&rsquo;t need to remind myself</p>
<p>Every fucking time I go to the gym of this expectation that comes with it remove the expectation</p>
<p>Remove the so that so I decided I&rsquo;m gonna start going to the gym because I want to look good. Okay cool</p>
<p>So when I get in the car to go to the gym tomorrow, I&rsquo;m going to the gym</p>
<p>Period so that when I&rsquo;m at the gym. I&rsquo;m not looking for everything</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing to have an expectation it</p>
<p>Kind of like freeze my mind to let me be more in the moment and to enjoy the task that I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a task. So just do the task stop with the fucking so that</p>
<p>And I know this kind of like contradicts the last one, but not really like if you get what I mean</p>
<p>You fucking get what I mean. It&rsquo;s like you understand why you&rsquo;re going you set the goal</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna go do what it takes to reach that goal</p>
<p>But like with me posting a tick-tock or posting a podcast. I&rsquo;m posting a podcast</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m posting a podcast to share what I know</p>
<p>You could even go as far as to say I&rsquo;m just posting a podcast but adding to share what I know</p>
<p>Helps me. So I&rsquo;m making a podcast to share the awareness that I&rsquo;ve gained through what I&rsquo;ve experienced in life</p>
<p>Okay, great. That&rsquo;s it. I don&rsquo;t tell myself</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m posting a podcast sharing what I know so that I can become a life coach. Uh-uh cut that part</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing this shit. So that I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m just sharing what I know. I&rsquo;m sharing what I know. That&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s on a tick-tock or a podcast. I am sharing what I know</p>
<p>I know why I&rsquo;m doing it</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t need to have that in mind every time I take a step to get toward where I want to go</p>
<p>That will fuck you. It will make you anxious. It pulls you out of the moment and it puts expectations on everything</p>
<p>Because every move you make you now expect a result with it if you&rsquo;re expecting results and you don&rsquo;t get one</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get pissed off like when I go to the gym and I don&rsquo;t start looking good</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be fucking pissed, you know, like you need to reevaluate you need to own up to that</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m talking about when you need to keep yourself going because in the gym, you&rsquo;re not gonna see a result for a while</p>
<p>So you just got to remind yourself. I&rsquo;m going to the gym period</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to the gym so that I can look a certain way</p>
<p>That is gonna fuck you because if you keep saying I&rsquo;m going to the gym to look good after three weeks</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be like man. I don&rsquo;t look that much better. Fuck this but after three months, you&rsquo;re gonna be like damn</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna keep going to the gym, you know, but I&rsquo;m just saying when you&rsquo;re working towards something</p>
<p>Stop doing shit. So that stop reminding yourself why you&rsquo;re doing everything because it sets the expectation of</p>
<p>You need to get something for what you&rsquo;re doing right now just do the activity to do it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to the gym period go have a good ass workout while you&rsquo;re at the gym be at the gym went to the gym</p>
<p>You know what? I mean go and fucking do it have the experience do the task when I&rsquo;m making this podcast</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sharing my awareness</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m not reminding myself so that I can become a life coach because</p>
<p>Whenever I go to become a life coach if it fucking flops, I&rsquo;m gonna look back on everything</p>
<p>I just did and be so much more discontent and so much more upset because I&rsquo;m gonna look at all the effort</p>
<p>I just put into the things leading up to it as a failure and for nothing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna look at everything. I just did like it was fucking worthless and I shouldn&rsquo;t even have like wasting my time and effort</p>
<p>so stop</p>
<p>Associating everything with a fucking so that and just start doing shit</p>
<p>And like I said, this helps with anxiety because it helps you not get overwhelmed</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re every move you make has a so that on it</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re expecting so many little things from every move you make so your brain is trying to take into consideration</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re doing and then also what you&rsquo;re expecting to get from it and also the other five things that you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>So every single thing has like a stack of like a another an extra little add-on to consider</p>
<p>So if you just look at your life as actions</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re good. You&rsquo;ll have a lot less anxiety</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll feel a lot less overwhelmed all the time because I deal with that a whole lot. So</p>
<p>Simplicity is the key for that. It&rsquo;s helped me a ton</p>
<p>This frees you up to find the fun and shit</p>
<p>This helps you have fun and what you&rsquo;re doing because you&rsquo;re just doing what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>To do it like with going to the gym. It&rsquo;s like your goal is to lose weight. That&rsquo;s a given</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a given with going to the gym. That&rsquo;s just a bonus</p>
<p>So if you start going to the gym, you&rsquo;re gonna lose weight. That&rsquo;s a given</p>
<p>So put that out of your fucking head, you know, that&rsquo;s coming. You ain&rsquo;t got to worry about it</p>
<p>But now when you go to the gym, you get to have fun</p>
<p>You get to talk to people you get to mingle you get to learn new exercises</p>
<p>You get to like tap into what feels good and likes, you know</p>
<p>What I mean, you get to find the fun and shit you get to find the fun in what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>Same with doing my lives on tik-tok. It&rsquo;s like I just get to have fucking fun</p>
<p>I get to just enjoy what I&rsquo;m doing as I&rsquo;m doing it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like holding myself accountable and reassuring myself</p>
<p>this is all for something because if something gets in the way of it or</p>
<p>One of my actions gets prevented</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get fucking pissed off because if I&rsquo;m doing this action for something and I can&rsquo;t do it now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get even more fucking mad than before if there&rsquo;s an expectation on it. I</p>
<p>Hope I&rsquo;m making this simple enough so people are like able to keep up with it because my brain be going a mile a fucking</p>
<p>minute I</p>
<p>Really think my biggest tip with this part is simplicity like simplify everything</p>
<p>Make it as simple as possible and like my example with going to the gym if your goal is to lose weight</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a given with going to the gym. It&rsquo;s just gonna happen with going to the gym</p>
<p>So you that doesn&rsquo;t need to be your focus every time you go to the gym</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just gonna be the bonus of it</p>
<p>And I hate those fucking people that are like fall in love with the doing of things</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like no don&rsquo;t fall in love with it. Don&rsquo;t try to make yourself like like it, but look for the fun in it</p>
<p>Learn how to set yourself free mentally from stressing out why you&rsquo;re doing so much shit</p>
<p>So you can actually find the ways to enjoy it</p>
<p>Take off so much of the expectation of what you&rsquo;re doing like you still need to do things</p>
<p>so that but I&rsquo;m saying just try on a new perspective and</p>
<p>Try on not adding so many so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>All right friends do you feel happier</p>
