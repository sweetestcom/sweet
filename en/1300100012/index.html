    <p>all right we live we live</p>
<p>this shit working Bam can we hear each other</p>
<p>should I shut myself off</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>damn hello welcome to my weekly podcast I&rsquo;m solo</p>
<p>and shut the door so nobody interrupts us</p>
<p>Shazam I&rsquo;m back</p>
<p>riding totally 100 solo this time</p>
<p>here to answer your questions</p>
<p>talk to you</p>
<p>see what the fuck&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>out there in the</p>
<p>wild world of Twitter</p>
<p>thank you everybody that</p>
<p>tuned in to the show we did yesterday on Serious</p>
<p>I did a show for an hour yesterday on Raw Dog</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna try to do that more often cause it&rsquo;s fun</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fun just to do even for a goof but it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great way to</p>
<p>promote gigs and</p>
<p>you know get things cracking</p>
<p>not this weekend</p>
<p>as in tomorrow and Saturday and</p>
<p>Sunday but next weekend next Friday</p>
<p>not exactly</p>
<p>should a date I&rsquo;ll be at Gotham I think it&rsquo;s the 26th</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s today&rsquo;s date</p>
<p>7 days yeah the 26th</p>
<p>the 26th I&rsquo;ll be at Gotham</p>
<p>for 2 shows in</p>
<p>New York City I don&rsquo;t get to New York City very often</p>
<p>I only go there like once</p>
<p>every year and 1/2 2 years</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s already almost sold out so if</p>
<p>you want to get tickets you got to hop on that shit now</p>
<p>Gotham Comedy Club in New York City</p>
<p>you know how to use the Google Sun</p>
<p>I would throw up</p>
<p>links but if you really want to go you&rsquo;ll figure it out</p>
<p>right so get</p>
<p>Eddie on my podcast I will definitely</p>
<p>Brian was supposed to be my lips are very</p>
<p>shiny today</p>
<p>Brian was supposed to be here</p>
<p>today for this one but he got held in traffic and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s getting boned by the IRS</p>
<p>he owe some back</p>
<p>taxes pay your</p>
<p>taxes bitches</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s Uncle joe&rsquo;s advice for the day pay your fucking</p>
<p>taxes the worst</p>
<p>thing is when the IRS</p>
<p>like signals you out</p>
<p>singles you out as a guy who&rsquo;s not paying</p>
<p>taxes and then they just</p>
<p>crawl up your asshole and look around</p>
<p>the tax laws are so</p>
<p>gross the whole</p>
<p>thing is so gross</p>
<p>the idea that you have to pay such a</p>
<p>giant percentage</p>
<p>of what you make to do</p>
<p>to keep more people</p>
<p>arresting people</p>
<p>for buying pot to do what to fix the streets is that</p>
<p>where the fuck is the</p>
<p>money going god damn it</p>
<p>our machine is just too goddamn big</p>
<p>you know when you get to a certain amount of</p>
<p>money you get into a</p>
<p>48% tax bracket you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>you have to pay half of what you make half</p>
<p>literally that&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>and the crazy</p>
<p>thing is just</p>
<p>the people who make the more</p>
<p>money the more</p>
<p>money you make rather the higher percentage</p>
<p>you have to pay</p>
<p>so not only do you pay more</p>
<p>money just because you make more</p>
<p>money which seems</p>
<p>that seems rational to me</p>
<p>but the fact that you pay a higher percent</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just like saying</p>
<p>listen we know you got it fuck you give us the money</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s really that simple</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense that someone who makes more money</p>
<p>somehow or another uses</p>
<p>a higher percentage of resources</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s completely unfair it makes no sense but</p>
<p>people just accept</p>
<p>it they just accept it and just take it in the ass</p>
<p>and the machine</p>
<p>keeps rolling</p>
<p>on there will be no end</p>
<p>or will there</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll go to</p>
<p>first the twitter</p>
<p>to check it out the twitter feed that is on</p>
<p>the ustream page</p>
<p>which is you</p>
<p>stream dot TV channel</p>
<p>slash Joe Dash Rogan</p>
<p>live which will</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>and then I also go to forums</p>
<p>Joe Rogan net that&rsquo;s my website</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>forum up there</p>
<p>dedicated to this particular</p>
<p>or rather a threat</p>
<p>dedicated to this</p>
<p>particular broadcast</p>
<p>and so I&rsquo;ll answer some questions from there too you</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>pull out of Iran</p>
<p>afghan and you&rsquo;d save a fortune yeah what is that</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s a simple way of looking at it</p>
<p>right CMC Dermo 73</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a simple</p>
<p>way looking at everybody says pull out but</p>
<p>why the fuck are we there in the</p>
<p>first place like what is going on</p>
<p>you know I mean is it as simple as</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;re over there because we need to keep</p>
<p>these terrorists from becoming</p>
<p>strong we need to go and attack them at their base</p>
<p>okay if that was what was agreed</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s the reason why we&rsquo;re there</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of people that say that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make any sense</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of people that say there&rsquo;s very few Taliban</p>
<p>that are actually left in Afghanistan that we have</p>
<p>other motives</p>
<p>and that these motives</p>
<p>might be the</p>
<p>natural gas pipeline that runs through Afghanistan</p>
<p>which everybody</p>
<p>apparently has been trying to</p>
<p>control for years or</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also very overlooked and</p>
<p>a subject that people like</p>
<p>they kind of poo poo</p>
<p>and they make it seem like it&rsquo;s not that big a deal</p>
<p>is the opium market</p>
<p>Afghanistan produces</p>
<p>some 90 something percent of the entire</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s opium</p>
<p>the entire world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Poppy sees the entire</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s heroin</p>
<p>more than 90</p>
<p>of it is produced in Afghanistan</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>crazy right</p>
<p>you hear about that you like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of goddamn</p>
<p>money in heroin</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of goddamn</p>
<p>money in opium</p>
<p>I mean if all of it is being produced</p>
<p>literally almost all of it in this one place like</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s making some fucking</p>
<p>money off that it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>the US got in there and they stopped making heroin</p>
<p>no there&rsquo;s more heroin now heroin</p>
<p>apparently you talk to people no</p>
<p>you know I know people do heroin</p>
<p>and they they say there&rsquo;s more heroin</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s easier to get now</p>
<p>you know what the fuck man wait</p>
<p>what is really</p>
<p>going on then you find out that the President</p>
<p>of Afghanistan this is</p>
<p>absolute fact</p>
<p>president of Afghanistan his brother</p>
<p>was being paid</p>
<p>by the CIA for years</p>
<p>like our government dollars</p>
<p>were going to pay</p>
<p>the brother</p>
<p>of the president</p>
<p>of Afghanistan who&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>Poppy business</p>
<p>this guy is</p>
<p>involved in the opium</p>
<p>trade this guy is involved in the heroin</p>
<p>trade and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an employee of the CIA</p>
<p>like really is it that blatant</p>
<p>is that obvious</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s for sure there&rsquo;s 1t</p>
<p>of fucking corruption</p>
<p>when it comes to the higher</p>
<p>levels of government</p>
<p>but are they really selling drugs</p>
<p>are they really doing it that openly</p>
<p>it seems ridiculous</p>
<p>right it seems like there&rsquo;s no way that</p>
<p>could be possible</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way it</p>
<p>could be that corrupt if it was we would have</p>
<p>heard about it</p>
<p>but when you</p>
<p>start researching the history of the CIA</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;ve been accused of doing this forever</p>
<p>not just accused</p>
<p>of doing this but people who don&rsquo;t make any sense like</p>
<p>crazy people and you know</p>
<p>internet conspiracy theorists but no they&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>accused of doing</p>
<p>it by people who used to work for the CIA</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been accused of doing</p>
<p>it by people who&rsquo;ve actually just flown in the drugs</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a great case</p>
<p>about a guy named</p>
<p>Barry Seals from Mina Arkansas</p>
<p>this guy used to</p>
<p>drive and fly into</p>
<p>Mina Arkansas</p>
<p>and drop off big packages of cocaine</p>
<p>I think we talked</p>
<p>about this before</p>
<p>I talked about this before and anyway</p>
<p>these 2 kids</p>
<p>inadvertently were there when the cocaine got dropped</p>
<p>they witnessed</p>
<p>what had happened</p>
<p>so they took</p>
<p>these kids and they murdered them</p>
<p>and they left their bodies on the train tracks</p>
<p>and the excuse the official excuse that the</p>
<p>police used was that these kids had gotten high</p>
<p>and that they had fallen asleep on the</p>
<p>plane tracks because they were on drugs</p>
<p>well the mothers</p>
<p>of the kids</p>
<p>forced autopsies the parents forced autopsies</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t want to do autopsies but they forced</p>
<p>them and they got them done and it turns out that</p>
<p>these kids had been murdered</p>
<p>they had been</p>
<p>stabbed multiple times</p>
<p>before they had been put on these</p>
<p>train tracks</p>
<p>so then the investigation</p>
<p>goes further and it turns up this guy named</p>
<p>Barry Seals was a CIA employee</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>documented this guy&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>great long history</p>
<p>with the CIA</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s you know tons of</p>
<p>pictures there&rsquo;s tons of</p>
<p>you know documentation on this guy and this guy</p>
<p>was flying in drugs from</p>
<p>South America</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what he did he did it for the CIA</p>
<p>and right when he was</p>
<p>about to go testify the guy gets murdered</p>
<p>he gets assassinated</p>
<p>with George bush&rsquo;s</p>
<p>phone number in his pocket</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s that guy there&rsquo;s another guy</p>
<p>named Michael Rupert and Michael Rupert</p>
<p>has a website now and he&rsquo;s got a bunch of books on</p>
<p>the whole situation but his</p>
<p>story is that he was working for the LAPD</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if he worked in</p>
<p>narcotics but he&rsquo;s involved somehow or another</p>
<p>in some narcotics case</p>
<p>and it turns out that the CIA was involved</p>
<p>and the CIA</p>
<p>was protecting</p>
<p>these people and the CIA was selling drugs and he</p>
<p>went to try to report it</p>
<p>they squashed</p>
<p>everything and he just went public with everything and</p>
<p>he gets very little attention I mean it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>shocking how little attention he gets</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s a fascinating dude</p>
<p>this Michael Rupert guy he&rsquo;s got a couple</p>
<p>really fascinating books</p>
<p>I think the End of the Rubicon is one and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the one I&rsquo;ve read and there&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a few other ones so basically like</p>
<p>going into great depth and detail all of his research</p>
<p>on the CIA and their involvement in drugs</p>
<p>why why would they do that why</p>
<p>would our government do that</p>
<p>fucking there&rsquo;s a lot of goddamn money in it</p>
<p>I think they could justify that either so much money</p>
<p>involved in drugs and someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna make that money people are addicted to drugs</p>
<p>like why don&rsquo;t we make that money and at least that</p>
<p>money is being made by the good guys I mean that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the most idealistic</p>
<p>point of view</p>
<p>make sure your kids don&rsquo;t do drugs</p>
<p>make sure no one he loves</p>
<p>does drugs but let&rsquo;s be honest</p>
<p>there are people out there that are</p>
<p>gonna do drugs and if anybody</p>
<p>should make the money it should be the good guys</p>
<p>I can see people falling for that</p>
<p>but the bottom line is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all greed it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>this nasty evil</p>
<p>greed that&rsquo;s the whole reason why some drugs are</p>
<p>legal and some drugs are illegal it&rsquo;s because when</p>
<p>they make them illegal they can control what you do</p>
<p>bacon you can&rsquo;t control</p>
<p>things that are really easy to grow like marijuana</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the main reasons why marijuana</p>
<p>is illegal is because it&rsquo;s so goddamn easy to grow</p>
<p>you can just</p>
<p>plant seeds out in a</p>
<p>field that will grow on its own</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even need to help it</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s a really hardy plant</p>
<p>and I know a lot of</p>
<p>morons that grow pot</p>
<p>and when you know it&rsquo;s an easy</p>
<p>thing to do like that you can&rsquo;t control that</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna be able to control it there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be people selling it left and right</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna get taxes from that because people are just</p>
<p>gonna exchange cash or whatever the fuck they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do with it</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna be</p>
<p>able to wrap something up the way that you can wrap up</p>
<p>oxycontins or something like that</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s very difficult to produce an oxycontin</p>
<p>you know they like that they don&rsquo;t like heroin</p>
<p>heroin is just like what are you doing you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>growing a plant</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>scraping some shit off the</p>
<p>plant and you&rsquo;re selling</p>
<p>no stop that&rsquo;s illegal</p>
<p>we won&rsquo;t let you do that</p>
<p>but we will let you buy</p>
<p>these pills</p>
<p>that are basically the same goddamn</p>
<p>thing they&rsquo;re just made by a</p>
<p>pharmaceutical company and they process it</p>
<p>and they make this orally</p>
<p>ingestible heroin</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>Oxycontin is</p>
<p>I mean it literally they call it hillbilly heroin</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking heroin</p>
<p>it really is heroin</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just eating it</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating it in a pill form just like</p>
<p>Marinol is THC</p>
<p>in a pill form</p>
<p>that stuff&rsquo;s supposed to suck</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to people that say that</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>thc&rsquo;s only one active element in marijuana there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whole bunch of it&rsquo;s way better to get the actual</p>
<p>stuff from the plant</p>
<p>you know I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true with heroin</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done heroin</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done Marinol either</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>heroin I&rsquo;m scared of anything that&rsquo;s addictive</p>
<p>but if I was a</p>
<p>musician I might</p>
<p>consider it I</p>
<p>might I might</p>
<p>snort a little</p>
<p>every now and then you know</p>
<p>write down once</p>
<p>today and never</p>
<p>again or something</p>
<p>try to convince myself that somehow or another I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be addicted I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how addictive it really is</p>
<p>I hear varying reports</p>
<p>know that the problem I have with whenever</p>
<p>someone talks</p>
<p>about things being addicted</p>
<p>and not being addicted is that</p>
<p>alcohol is addictive</p>
<p>you know people get addicted to alcohol</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not addicted to it so I don&rsquo;t get that</p>
<p>I mean I can</p>
<p>I could if someone told me</p>
<p>right now I</p>
<p>could never have another beer or another</p>
<p>glass of wine for the rest of my life I&rsquo;d be like</p>
<p>okay I mean I</p>
<p>enjoy it I like</p>
<p>having a shot</p>
<p>every now and then with my friends just to get fucking</p>
<p>crazy a shot before a show is fun but</p>
<p>realistically it&rsquo;s not that important</p>
<p>you know I don&rsquo;t need it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really addictive to me</p>
<p>but to some people it is</p>
<p>okay is that the case with heroin</p>
<p>is that the case with</p>
<p>cigarettes seem</p>
<p>to be the one they&rsquo;ve got the most wired</p>
<p>cigarettes seem to be the one they they can addict</p>
<p>the most people to</p>
<p>you know because there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of people that don&rsquo;t get addicted to the normal stuff</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a lot of people that</p>
<p>drink coffee</p>
<p>and they drink it all the time but they can just quit</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t bother them at all</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some people that they</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t have coffee</p>
<p>every day they&rsquo;re fucked</p>
<p>those people are addicted to caffeine</p>
<p>when I was writing my blog I was writing a</p>
<p>monthly blog</p>
<p>right before I recorded my</p>
<p>my Spike TV comedy special</p>
<p>I wanted to make sure I kept my</p>
<p>brain like real sharp</p>
<p>and I said well the best</p>
<p>way to do that is to perform as much as I can but also</p>
<p>write as much as I can so I forced myself</p>
<p>into writing</p>
<p>a blog every day for a</p>
<p>whole month and</p>
<p>when I did that you know I was</p>
<p>drinking a lot of coffee</p>
<p>and I was drinking French</p>
<p>press coffee</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s really fucking strong</p>
<p>you know and I make it</p>
<p>strong too I like it I like a</p>
<p>strong cup of coffee</p>
<p>but the problem is I was</p>
<p>drinking this shit like 2</p>
<p>3 cups a day</p>
<p>and then I did it like</p>
<p>30 days in a row</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>point in time</p>
<p>where I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>drink it for a day and I had a headache</p>
<p>and it was like oh</p>
<p>like my brain was</p>
<p>getting accustomed</p>
<p>to having all these</p>
<p>stimulants in it</p>
<p>and I realized okay this is not good I</p>
<p>gotta stop that shit</p>
<p>lately I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>drinking tea</p>
<p>Brian turned me out to this thing</p>
<p>this is like this</p>
<p>you put the tea</p>
<p>leaves in there and then you put the</p>
<p>water in there</p>
<p>and you can it like</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to like have a tea bag you get like</p>
<p>fresh tea leaves taste good</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like I Sometimes I need something warm to</p>
<p>drink it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>like my friend</p>
<p>Tate he says the best he said</p>
<p>coffee is like a warm hug</p>
<p>but I got addicted to coffee</p>
<p>but I mean I was only addicted for a couple days</p>
<p>a couple days I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>drinking it just</p>
<p>drinking water and</p>
<p>everything is back to normal</p>
<p>again luckily</p>
<p>but this is 30 days in a row</p>
<p>not 30 years in a row you know I couldn&rsquo;t imagine that</p>
<p>but cigarettes</p>
<p>seem to be the one that they&rsquo;ve got the</p>
<p>most nailed as to how to just get you fucking hooked</p>
<p>you know um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a an</p>
<p>article that I read recently</p>
<p>where they were discussing</p>
<p>all the different additives that the government</p>
<p>allows them to put into cigarettes</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s 599 of them</p>
<p>how fucking nuts is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s 599 different chemicals</p>
<p>and you look at them</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re some sort of a</p>
<p>pharma chemist</p>
<p>sort of a character you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna have any idea what the fuck they are</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>599 of them in cigarettes</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say was just supposed to be fucking tobacco</p>
<p>like what the fuck is</p>
<p>going on what is that</p>
<p>I mean is it a preserve</p>
<p>are they preservatives is it</p>
<p>is it like that</p>
<p>Russell Crowe</p>
<p>movie The Insider</p>
<p>is all that</p>
<p>shit actually designed to make it more addictive</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the most damning</p>
<p>things I think</p>
<p>about politicians is that they</p>
<p>never talk about</p>
<p>cigarettes you know</p>
<p>they always want to talk</p>
<p>about the ill</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>bad drugs out there and you know this terrible</p>
<p>thing that can</p>
<p>happen if your kids get involved in drugs but</p>
<p>nobody wants to ban</p>
<p>cigarettes like nobody ever says that</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>those fucking tobacco companies</p>
<p>spend a bankroll</p>
<p>they spend a fuckload of money</p>
<p>all right what else</p>
<p>let me go to the questions here</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of questions and they keep moving fast</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a rambling motherfucker</p>
<p>Joe wear a different</p>
<p>color shirt in the UFC broadcast next time no</p>
<p>no I like wearing black shirts</p>
<p>and I get them for free</p>
<p>I get clothes from Affliction for free</p>
<p>send me some cool shit</p>
<p>so that I don&rsquo;t make fun of them anymore</p>
<p>I like their stuff I like some of their stuff</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there was some</p>
<p>Scully stuff that was just a little too Scully</p>
<p>and flaming for me</p>
<p>but I got a pair of the dragon jeans</p>
<p>they got dope leather jackets too</p>
<p>and I like their</p>
<p>the Japanese styled stuff they had all that</p>
<p>I forget the man&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>tattoo artist designed a bunch of</p>
<p>t shirts for them that were really fucking cool</p>
<p>like right up my alley like</p>
<p>tiger versus samurai type</p>
<p>stuff I got a bunch of those I love those</p>
<p>but apparently that that guy</p>
<p>he was selling his same designs to a couple different</p>
<p>t shirt companies they had to</p>
<p>get rid of them because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some sort of a copyright</p>
<p>lawsuit thing going on</p>
<p>affliction crows are fucking brutal</p>
<p>ed Hardy is the most brutal to me</p>
<p>ed Hardy should assassinate John from John K 8</p>
<p>because that guy single handedly</p>
<p>made Ed Hardy</p>
<p>shirts like that is just like that&rsquo;s the gold</p>
<p>stamp bang douchebag</p>
<p>like when that guy started wearing it everywhere</p>
<p>like I think Ed Hardy was probably paying him</p>
<p>but little did they know that</p>
<p>that just put the fucking the Douche</p>
<p>label on the Ed Hardy</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a chick that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>one of the morning DJs in Denver</p>
<p>her name is Missy</p>
<p>and she calls them douche capes</p>
<p>which is the perfect way to describe them douche caves</p>
<p>okay I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>glad you guys liked the Raw dog show that was fun</p>
<p>that was real fun am I coming to Australia anytime</p>
<p>again soon I&rsquo;ll be in Australia next time the</p>
<p>UFC is gonna be there</p>
<p>I really can&rsquo;t fly over there</p>
<p>just to fly over there</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the time</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too long 16 fucking hours in the air</p>
<p>I enjoyed the shit out of it though I had a</p>
<p>great goddamn time</p>
<p>that strongest man dude that&rsquo;s gonna fight Tim Sylvia</p>
<p>Aaron Davies</p>
<p>ask me a question</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this guy Pujanowski he&rsquo;s like one of the</p>
<p>he won strongman competition like many times and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>scheduled to fight Tim</p>
<p>Sylvia who&rsquo;s a former UFC Heavyweight Champion</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking that fight and everybody&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>going oh I want to see this fight this is a</p>
<p>great fight is a great fight like</p>
<p>Tim said we can fight</p>
<p>like just kids ray Mercer knocked him out just cuz</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s lost to a couple different guys like Fade or</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big goddamn difference between</p>
<p>losing the Fade or and losing to a guy&rsquo;s had one fight</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s really good at lifting shit</p>
<p>that guy&rsquo;s gonna get his ass handed to him if</p>
<p>Tim Sylvia loses that</p>
<p>fight there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>wrong he&rsquo;s got something</p>
<p>wrong with him and he probably shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fight anymore</p>
<p>I think Tim</p>
<p>Sylvia should be able to keep that dude at bay</p>
<p>I mean all he is is big and strong</p>
<p>I mean I just cannot see a world</p>
<p>where Tim Sylvia</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t bomb on that guy as he&rsquo;s coming in</p>
<p>you know I mean I</p>
<p>could be wrong</p>
<p>he could just get</p>
<p>completely overwhelmed</p>
<p>by the power but</p>
<p>technique is more important than</p>
<p>power and fighting</p>
<p>and if one guy I mean</p>
<p>you can hate on Tim</p>
<p>Sylvia all you want the guy was the</p>
<p>UFC Heavyweight</p>
<p>Champion and he wasn&rsquo;t because he sucked</p>
<p>go watch his</p>
<p>fight with Rico Rodriguez</p>
<p>you know watch</p>
<p>watch some of his</p>
<p>fights you know</p>
<p>watch when he head kicked</p>
<p>Trey Teligman</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s fucking dangerous man Tim Sylvia</p>
<p>is one of the most</p>
<p>underrated and</p>
<p>underlook guys yeah he got</p>
<p>knocked out by Ray Mercer</p>
<p>but guess what</p>
<p>ray Mercer connects on your head like that everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going out he</p>
<p>definitely fucked up and he</p>
<p>definitely didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fight smart in that</p>
<p>fight without a doubt</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>write him off just because of one performance he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still accomplished a lot of dangerous</p>
<p>shit he&rsquo;s always been a sucker for that overhand</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>a sucker but he&rsquo;s getting hit gotten hit with it before</p>
<p>Randy Couture</p>
<p>dropped him with it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where Alowski hit him with</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>obviously what Ray Mercer hit him with you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a lazy jab they said</p>
<p>but I think</p>
<p>that Pujinowski guy</p>
<p>is like wow</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re jumping into the deep end of the pool son</p>
<p>you know Tim</p>
<p>Sylvia is not that old Tim Sylvia</p>
<p>has had some</p>
<p>tough fights but</p>
<p>not that much</p>
<p>no I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be a real</p>
<p>tough fight for that Pujnaski guy I</p>
<p>could be wrong</p>
<p>I could be wrong</p>
<p>he might do</p>
<p>those running fucking leg kicks like he did to that</p>
<p>other dude we just</p>
<p>basically ran out like a bull</p>
<p>but that other guy</p>
<p>comparing him to Tim</p>
<p>Sylvia it&rsquo;s just ridiculous</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s smaller</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not as nearly as experienced he&rsquo;s just a boxer</p>
<p>I mean there&rsquo;s so many differences between</p>
<p>the first guy you fought and</p>
<p>fighting the UFC</p>
<p>heavyweight</p>
<p>champ that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>crazy he might not even get to him because he&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>fight in between then he&rsquo;s got a fight</p>
<p>before that I think in</p>
<p>April he&rsquo;s fighting</p>
<p>someone else and then he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna fight Tim</p>
<p>Sylvia right</p>
<p>after that he</p>
<p>might not beat that guy that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fighting April</p>
<p>I mean if a guy knows how to</p>
<p>fight it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>just a big goddamn difference between a guy who&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>strong he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna leave openings man</p>
<p>you know if he</p>
<p>leaves opening someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna catch him</p>
<p>and if someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna catch him he can&rsquo;t put muscles in your face and</p>
<p>you know I mean I don&rsquo;t know exactly what kind of a</p>
<p>background he has in</p>
<p>fighting other than being</p>
<p>super strong but</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t look like much he looked real stiff</p>
<p>I mean once he hits you if he gets a hold of you</p>
<p>starts hitting him</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fucked but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all that before he gets a hold of you</p>
<p>stuff that&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>herky jerky</p>
<p>all muscle no technique</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be interesting</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re a guy&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>strong let&rsquo;s do a</p>
<p>learn a few techniques get them really good and fuck</p>
<p>I mean you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about a guy that</p>
<p>literally is the one of the</p>
<p>strongest men</p>
<p>to walk the planet</p>
<p>you know if you could</p>
<p>teach that guy</p>
<p>teach that guy some some</p>
<p>solid wrestling</p>
<p>teach that guy like it just a good amount</p>
<p>you know just a few moves</p>
<p>just teach them how to keep his hands up</p>
<p>close the distance</p>
<p>teach them some take downs and</p>
<p>teach them to get on top of dudes and just</p>
<p>smush their fucking head</p>
<p>you know a guy like that if you</p>
<p>taught him some shit</p>
<p>he would only need a few</p>
<p>things just because he&rsquo;s so goddamn</p>
<p>strong a few</p>
<p>things he would be able to beat a lot of guys</p>
<p>but Tim Sylvia</p>
<p>who I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about that son</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about that son</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see what else we got here</p>
<p>I watched a video today of a dude who</p>
<p>cut his fucking balls off</p>
<p>the dude somebody posted it on my message board and</p>
<p>this guy it says something crazy Ozzy man or deranged</p>
<p>Ozzy man that&rsquo;s the thread cuts his balls off</p>
<p>this guy tied</p>
<p>a rubber band around his balls</p>
<p>until his balls</p>
<p>like literally died</p>
<p>like they turned like like dead and gray</p>
<p>and then he hacked his balls off with a knife</p>
<p>really do you</p>
<p>want to see it if you want to see it you know what I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>throw the link</p>
<p>I just let everybody know that it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>completely disgusting there&rsquo;s no way you</p>
<p>should really be</p>
<p>watching this</p>
<p>but if you want to</p>
<p>I will copy the link</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna post it on twitter</p>

<p>rough fucking</p>
<p>handsome character and she&rsquo;s a beautiful</p>
<p>woman and they make great couple</p>

<p>some new scan came out with all his twitters</p>
<p>are not not as</p>
<p>twitter as text messages that he sent to her I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>first of all</p>

<p>these girls that they would</p>
<p>wanna put his</p>
<p>like did even</p>

<p>it seems like</p>
<p>these girls like</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even like</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t even talk to him</p>
<p>it seems like you know like it was this this</p>
<p>thing was just all fucking</p>
<p>and because of that I</p>
<p>think they were like</p>
<p>they felt slighted</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>getting out of this I&rsquo;m getting that they felt slighted</p>
<p>you know that here&rsquo;s this guy with like the most</p>
<p>squeaky clean</p>
<p>image in the</p>
<p>world and this</p>
<p>image is what he used to make 1t of money</p>
<p>and you know he&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>super successful guy</p>
<p>at the most you know like lucrative</p>
<p>sport in the</p>
<p>world and the</p>
<p>sport the most connected to</p>
<p>money to big businesses to</p>

<p>where they didn&rsquo;t know who he was</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d have to go to like Malaysia to</p>
<p>cheat poor fella</p>
<p>poor fella</p>
<p>what do I think of James Tony</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m disturbed by James Tony</p>
<p>his recent speeches</p>
<p>you know oh</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on with him physically</p>
<p>you know I don&rsquo;t know I mean I</p>
<p>guess he wants to fight heavyweight</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that he says he wants to fight Brock Lesnar</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s the case I</p>
<p>think maybe the best thing to</p>
<p>do to get this over with is just give him Brock Lesnar</p>
<p>you know I mean if</p>
<p>James Tony loses to somebody</p>
<p>the way I look at it is like</p>
<p>James Tony obviously</p>
<p>all the respect in the</p>
<p>world as a boxer all time</p>
<p>really one of the</p>
<p>craftiest guys to come</p>
<p>along in decades</p>
<p>and a guy who really utilized that old</p>
<p>Archie Moore shoulders</p>
<p>shoulder roll</p>
<p>style like had a real</p>
<p>classic old</p>
<p>timers boxing</p>
<p>style like real good at</p>
<p>like rolling with</p>
<p>punches then coming back like his counter</p>
<p>right hands</p>
<p>against John Ruiz</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a YouTube</p>
<p>clip of them like you see how beautiful his timing was</p>
<p>and like when</p>
<p>he just destroyed a Vander Holyfield in in their</p>
<p>fight man he&rsquo;s a SO</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s so skillful as a boxer very very</p>
<p>skillful but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much more to MMA</p>
<p>than just boxing and I&rsquo;m not hearing</p>
<p>about him going to American Top Team</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not hearing about him</p>
<p>going to Team Quest</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not hearing</p>
<p>about him going to</p>
<p>you know to like high</p>
<p>level camps</p>
<p>to work with big</p>
<p>wrestlers they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna try to take him down because</p>
<p>otherwise I&rsquo;m hearing him say</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna fight Brock</p>
<p>Lesnar I&rsquo;m hearing</p>
<p>one of 2 things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m either hearing he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t give a fuck he&rsquo;s just here to get paid</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m hearing</p>
<p>he is crazy</p>
<p>and he thinks that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be able to stop Brock</p>
<p>Lesnar from taking him down</p>
<p>by hitting him with a punch</p>
<p>either one is not</p>
<p>good because one of them means he&rsquo;s delusional that he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>understand what this is all</p>
<p>about and the</p>
<p>other one means that he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>guy was looking for money</p>
<p>either one is not that good</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know you know</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>boxing is a</p>
<p>tough goddamn game</p>
<p>and when you&rsquo;ve been in it as long as</p>
<p>James Tony has</p>
<p>even though he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t take that much punishment</p>
<p>you know you got</p>
<p>you got to realize</p>
<p>these guys at a certain</p>
<p>point time and</p>
<p>you know they only have</p>
<p>you only have a certain amount more</p>
<p>punches you can take you know</p>
<p>at a certain</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a finite number and</p>
<p>after that number you&rsquo;re fucked</p>
<p>you know and I think</p>
<p>the thing with</p>
<p>James Tony is he has</p>
<p>this incredible</p>
<p>confidence in his hands</p>
<p>and he really</p>
<p>truly believes that if</p>
<p>a guy like Brock Lesnar</p>
<p>tries to take him down</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s going to be able to connect and with</p>
<p>those little</p>
<p>gloves he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to put him to sleep</p>
<p>I think it looks a lot easier than it is that&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>think I think if he starts training</p>
<p>with high level guys</p>
<p>he goes and you know work out with</p>
<p>King Mo work out with some like high</p>
<p>level wrestlers and see how easy it is for</p>
<p>those guys to take you down</p>
<p>you think you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>going to catch it with an uppercut</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t throw punches the same way</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re worried about a guy taking you down</p>
<p>the timing is not the same</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t stand the same way</p>
<p>if you stand the same way they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>kick your legs out</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to take you down easy</p>
<p>so you have to change your stance</p>
<p>so you now have to change your</p>
<p>stance as a boxer</p>
<p>you have to constantly be thinking about sprawling</p>
<p>constantly be</p>
<p>thinking about getting your under hook set</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the same sport it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>the punching ability that he has</p>
<p>is a huge plus</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll definitely if anybody</p>
<p>stupid enough to not try to take him down</p>
<p>and just box with him</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get your clock cleaned</p>
<p>you know for sure he&rsquo;s gonna hit you with some precise</p>
<p>counter punches</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna take advantage of little tiny</p>
<p>minute openings</p>
<p>because really he&rsquo;s such a high</p>
<p>level boxer we don&rsquo;t see that high level</p>
<p>striker in the octagon he can make a guy look foolish</p>
<p>if somebody chose</p>
<p>some crazy boxer</p>
<p>you know in the</p>
<p>UFC a guy who&rsquo;s got good hands</p>
<p>chose to try to</p>
<p>stand up just stand up with James Tony</p>
<p>he would make them look like a fool</p>
<p>he really would</p>
<p>really demoralized that he would talk shit to them</p>
<p>he would he would</p>
<p>start to what</p>
<p>bitch what bitch want some more this bitch boom</p>
<p>and he would keep just land and</p>
<p>punches on you he will fuck your world up</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re gonna do that I think guys are</p>
<p>gonna do one or 2</p>
<p>things they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna kick the living fuck out of his legs</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna take him down</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna stop that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna stop that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you know</p>
<p>if he got like</p>
<p>a big jiu jitsu guy gets all of them like a like</p>
<p>like Nepal Gabriel Gonzaga</p>
<p>Gabriel Gonzaga got a Holy</p>
<p>Jesus Christ</p>
<p>he might just start</p>
<p>breaking pieces of them off</p>
<p>you know and if</p>
<p>God help him if Brock</p>
<p>Lesnar wants to take him down</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>catch that guy with a punch</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not enough okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s enough for your average regular human</p>
<p>Brock Lesnar</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a freak of a man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the high end of the genetic spectrum</p>
<p>where you like you</p>
<p>know you can have a dude who looks like Ichabod Crane</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>could have a dude who looks like you know</p>
<p>like who is</p>
<p>Olive oil in that Popeye</p>
<p>movie what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>bitch&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>bitches I&rsquo;m so mean Shelly something another</p>
<p>whatever her name is real just think of</p>
<p>Lindsay Lohan</p>
<p>you can have a Lindsay Lohan</p>
<p>frame you know</p>
<p>a Paris Hilton</p>
<p>frame a little</p>
<p>skinny body or</p>
<p>you have the high end</p>
<p>you have Brock</p>
<p>was there some</p>
<p>weird instance</p>
<p>where you know Vikings fucked Vikings for</p>
<p>generation after</p>
<p>generation and</p>
<p>their warrior</p>
<p>bloodlines were passed on</p>
<p>and this motherfucker living in the woods in Minnesota</p>
<p>you know he</p>
<p>got the best of the best fucking head is that big</p>
<p>you know I mean that guy for sure has good</p>
<p>wrestling for sure works very hard on his technique</p>
<p>and all that&rsquo;s well and good</p>
<p>but at the end of the day that</p>
<p>motherfucker is a barbarian</p>
<p>the reason why he&rsquo;s so fucking good</p>
<p>he is a direct descendants</p>
<p>from ancient</p>
<p>giant warriors from thousands of years ago</p>
<p>that ain&rsquo;t a regular dude man you ain&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna just be able to</p>
<p>punch that guy and send him home packing</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna eat your</p>
<p>punch and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna pick you up in the air like you&rsquo;re a pillow</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna feel</p>
<p>so bad you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna feel terrible</p>
<p>the feeling that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have of helplessness</p>
<p>and hopelessness</p>
<p>when that fucking gorilla</p>
<p>grabs a hold of you and yanks you up in the air and</p>
<p>smashes you and then gets on top of you</p>
<p>and starts boom boom</p>
<p>those big fucking</p>
<p>lunch box fists</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a wrap son</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re done</p>
<p>okay you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna jab and</p>
<p>shoulder roll your way away from Brock</p>
<p>Lesnar he&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>fuck you he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna do whatever he wants to you</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna have you work for him you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna own him</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna be he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be your master he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna put a dog collar on you</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna do whatever the fuck he wants do you not</p>
<p>understand that</p>
<p>like that guy can do whatever he wants to you</p>
<p>if we didn&rsquo;t live</p>
<p>in this civilized culture</p>
<p>thousands years ago everyone that Brog Lesnar</p>
<p>fought would be</p>
<p>chained up in his yard they</p>
<p>would work for him</p>
<p>and they would just hope and pray that Brock</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>angry and decide to fuck you up today</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a scary dude man</p>
<p>you know is he the best guy in the</p>
<p>world I don&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta fight Fade</p>
<p>or he&rsquo;s gotta fight</p>
<p>Shane Carwin you know</p>
<p>we gotta see what happens we</p>
<p>gotta see what happens with fucking Kane</p>
<p>Velasquez Kane</p>
<p>Velasquez is a</p>
<p>motherfucker whoa</p>
<p>that guy&rsquo;s frighteningly talented</p>
<p>frighteningly talented and frighteningly</p>
<p>dedicated you know incredible technique too and</p>
<p>everything he does</p>
<p>his punches his takedowns his kicks</p>
<p>everything is perfect technique there&rsquo;s no fluff in</p>
<p>his technique there&rsquo;s no fat</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s no like excess movement</p>
<p>like the way he</p>
<p>throws leg kicks goddamn beautiful</p>
<p>just perfect technique</p>
<p>the way he throws</p>
<p>punches same thing</p>
<p>everything is perfect technique</p>
<p>his endurance is like</p>
<p>second to none</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m super</p>
<p>super impressed with Kane</p>
<p>Velasquez I</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s just amazing</p>
<p>you know the big question is</p>
<p>does all that amazing cardio</p>
<p>and technique</p>
<p>and discipline</p>
<p>does that make up for the</p>
<p>Great White Warrior</p>
<p>you know does it make up for that big fucking</p>
<p>freak of a monster like Brock Lesnar</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>angry motherfucker dude</p>
<p>when a dude beats your ass like you did to Frank Mir</p>
<p>and then still</p>
<p>get to the fucking camera</p>
<p>start screaming fuck yeah</p>
<p>fucking he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>screaming and spits coming out of his</p>
<p>mouth and his</p>
<p>mouthpiece is falling out you like what the fuck</p>
<p>you just beat his ass and you&rsquo;re still mad</p>
<p>and then he gets in</p>
<p>Frank mirror&rsquo;s face you fucking talking shit and</p>
<p>like whoa like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that is a guy who&rsquo;s got a lot of pent up shit</p>
<p>I mean when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>290 fucking plus</p>
<p>pounds of muscle</p>
<p>and your body&rsquo;s</p>
<p>covered with</p>
<p>swords he&rsquo;s got like</p>
<p>swords and skulls</p>
<p>and death it&rsquo;s all like axes and</p>
<p>swords and destruction</p>
<p>it actually says kill em all on his</p>
<p>lower back he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>a like a tramp</p>
<p>stamp that says kill</p>
<p>em all em all</p>
<p>whoa who&rsquo;s that there for</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a scary fucking dude man that&rsquo;s a real</p>
<p>angry motherfucker</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s real interesting to see</p>
<p>you know I would love to I really want to see him</p>
<p>versus Phaidor that is</p>
<p>a very very intriguing</p>
<p>fight to me because</p>
<p>they represent such</p>
<p>polar opposites</p>
<p>in Phaidor you have a guy that&rsquo;s you know a relatively</p>
<p>small heavyweight</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just about 6ft tall</p>
<p>he weighs about 230</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got a considerable amount of fat on them</p>
<p>I mean I would say like probably at least 20</p>
<p>pounds of fat like he&rsquo;s got a lot of jiggly fat</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t try to lose weight at all</p>
<p>you know he just says I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>heavy weight this is it this is what I</p>
<p>weigh I&rsquo;m gonna fight as a heavy weight</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>broad contrast between him his personality</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>stoic you you never see any expression out of him</p>
<p>I mean everybody</p>
<p>like comments on the fact that the dude like</p>
<p>never seems angry</p>
<p>never makes a mean face</p>
<p>never seems hurt</p>
<p>no matter if he&rsquo;s cut or no matter</p>
<p>if he&rsquo;s got the guy hurt and he&rsquo;s finishing him off</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just got this dead expression</p>
<p>whereas Brock</p>
<p>Lesnar is gigantic</p>
<p>has to cut weight to make 265</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a guy who you know</p>
<p>is at the very top of the weight</p>
<p>class and he&rsquo;s a guy who is just</p>
<p>flooded with emotion</p>
<p>flooded with anger</p>
<p>flooded with</p>
<p>expression I mean he wears</p>
<p>he is you know one of</p>
<p>those no nonsense</p>
<p>motherfuckers he wears who he is out on his sleeve</p>
<p>you know and he likes to talk a little shit and he gets</p>
<p>angry at people and he likes to</p>
<p>swear and you</p>
<p>know I mean he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>he likes to</p>
<p>stick the bird out the audience and</p>
<p>you know when they boom fuck you you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a totally different dude</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be very curious to see</p>
<p>those 2 approaches and see</p>
<p>which one would</p>
<p>ultimately prevail</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s really not</p>
<p>I mean it is fair but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not fair because Brock is so much goddamn bigger</p>
<p>Brock is a lean 265</p>
<p>and when he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>265 he&rsquo;s cutting a little weight to get down there</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;ll drop some</p>
<p>water weight like</p>
<p>maybe 10 15 pounds</p>
<p>you know to get down so he&rsquo;s inflated</p>
<p>you know well up</p>
<p>to like 280 by the time he actually gets in the octagon</p>
<p>you know just</p>
<p>solid as a fucking</p>
<p>house at 280</p>
<p>whereas Phaidor</p>
<p>you know at 230 that&rsquo;s 50</p>
<p>pounds less is not nearly a solid</p>
<p>you know Phaidor</p>
<p>at 230 is you know he&rsquo;s jiggly</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter if</p>
<p>he connects to your face you know he&rsquo;s a badass puncher</p>
<p>his jiu jitsu</p>
<p>is fantastic his grappling is fantastic he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great off of his back but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a big difference man</p>
<p>you know when all</p>
<p>things are equal</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not saying they are</p>
<p>skill wise because I do not believe they are I</p>
<p>think Phaidor is more</p>
<p>skillful and has more options to win the fight</p>
<p>but Brock is so fucking big</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s so much bigger when you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about Ôø°50 of</p>
<p>bone and muscle</p>
<p>50 fucking pounds</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a significant advantage</p>
<p>and then on</p>
<p>top of that you&rsquo;re dealing with a guy who&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>freak athlete</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s not just that he&rsquo;s big</p>
<p>like big and lumbering like they&rsquo;ve had guys that were</p>
<p>big and lumbering dudes that have fought in MMA</p>
<p>before they were</p>
<p>never like this</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>the way Brock moves he moves like a</p>
<p>light guy even though he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>giant guy he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a freak athlete you know</p>
<p>I mean he really is the descendants</p>
<p>of some fucking</p>
<p>crazy warrior tribe</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s got all this</p>
<p>angry energy to him that shit&rsquo;s genetic</p>
<p>a lot of it gotta be</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s my answer that question</p>
<p>all right that was the going off of the</p>
<p>you stream shit so I&rsquo;m gonna go to the</p>
<p>Joe Rogan net forum</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll see what kind of questions we got up in that</p>
<p>bitch we got 2 pages of questions</p>
<p>and a lot of them are joke questions</p>
<p>jokey jokey joke let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>Bebe Jones says hey Joe what do you know</p>
<p>is that a rhetorical question</p>
<p>I know I know I know not enough my friend</p>
<p>I know not enough nor do any of us that is the great</p>
<p>unfortunate truth</p>
<p>I say yeah how do you feel</p>
<p>about the Pope</p>
<p>knowing that child sex abuse was going on</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t say anything</p>
<p>about it when he was a priest in Germany</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re all fucking freaks</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s only one way you can be a guy who</p>
<p>dedicates your entire life to not having sex</p>
<p>the only way is your sexual deviant</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something wrong with you</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s any priest</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t really completely fucked up I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s one of the craziest ways</p>
<p>that anyone could ever make</p>
<p>make a living get through life</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to me</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a what you&rsquo;re a fucking priest</p>
<p>so wait a minute</p>
<p>you get to a different heaven than the people that get</p>
<p>pussy and get to have a good time</p>
<p>no you get to the same heaven</p>
<p>so by doing what</p>
<p>you do what everybody has to listen to you and give you</p>
<p>money and you get to fuck the kids</p>
<p>like what is that about</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>any sense because</p>
<p>it totally goes</p>
<p>against what the idea religion</p>
<p>should be all</p>
<p>about religion</p>
<p>should be all about</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like god&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Word to everyone and how to live your life</p>
<p>how come these guys that</p>
<p>spread god&rsquo;s Word they don&rsquo;t get to have sex</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that about</p>
<p>why why do they</p>
<p>why are they so fucked up</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you why</p>
<p>because initially preset</p>
<p>too much goddamn</p>
<p>power you know</p>
<p>a long time ago priests were allowed to have sex</p>
<p>but the problem was they were fucking everyone</p>
<p>because those are the guys that were in charge of God</p>
<p>those were the guys that were talking to God</p>
<p>those were the guys that were</p>
<p>they were at the</p>
<p>front of the fucking guideline</p>
<p>they had the Willy Wonka golden ticket</p>
<p>and they were reading the word of God</p>
<p>and in a village</p>
<p>you know of</p>
<p>several hundred people the guy who&rsquo;s the fucking priest</p>
<p>who speaks the word of God</p>
<p>and has to console all these</p>
<p>women and you know</p>
<p>maybe these</p>
<p>women are with husbands that you know are</p>
<p>tired of fucking them</p>
<p>and this priest</p>
<p>would love to</p>
<p>take step in and take some of that what&rsquo;s up</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you some God knowledge now give me some head</p>
<p>and that shit was</p>
<p>going on left and</p>
<p>right and that&rsquo;s why priests can&rsquo;t fuck</p>
<p>the reason why</p>
<p>priests aren&rsquo;t allowed to fuck is because</p>
<p>they were fucking everybody</p>
<p>so then well who the hell wants to be priest</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t fuck</p>
<p>you know once</p>
<p>they told them they couldn&rsquo;t fuck anymore what they did</p>
<p>well they probably some of them probably kept fucking</p>
<p>and said yeah yeah I&rsquo;ll stop</p>
<p>and they kept banging people then they got caught they</p>
<p>probably got flogged or something terrible like that</p>
<p>and so then they really</p>
<p>cracked down and made sure</p>
<p>that the priests are not allowed to have sex anymore</p>
<p>well once they</p>
<p>started doing that then</p>
<p>the only people that want to be priests were either</p>
<p>gays who could be with</p>
<p>other priests and they just like keep it on the</p>
<p>sneak sneak</p>
<p>and bag each</p>
<p>other or pedophiles</p>
<p>because they had access to all</p>
<p>these children</p>
<p>these children had to listen to</p>
<p>the overwhelming amount</p>
<p>I mean just</p>
<p>it hurts your head</p>
<p>to think about how many fucking kids</p>
<p>have been sexually abused by the Catholic Church</p>
<p>I mean it really hurts your head</p>
<p>it really hurts</p>
<p>to think that all</p>
<p>these people are so</p>
<p>blinded by a fucking fairy tale</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re willing to let some criminal</p>
<p>some monster</p>
<p>fuck their kids</p>
<p>after all these years</p>
<p>the fact that that is</p>
<p>still going on that is</p>
<p>mind boggling</p>
<p>it is mind boggling</p>
<p>that we pay any</p>
<p>attention to this fucking silly cult</p>
<p>and no one can say this no politician can say this</p>
<p>because for sure</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s gonna vote for you</p>
<p>have you come</p>
<p>out and say this is nonsense and if there is a God</p>
<p>for sure these are not his words</p>
<p>this is the word of man</p>
<p>how the I mean</p>
<p>if you just</p>
<p>analyze religion I mean just as</p>
<p>I mean let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say that once upon a time it was word of the word</p>
<p>of God who the fuck knows I don&rsquo;t know you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I mean if there really is a God I always said I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>were so much crazier than the stories that people tell</p>
<p>about heaven</p>
<p>when you smoke the</p>
<p>MT and you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>communicated in another dimension</p>
<p>with beings that are made out of love and</p>
<p>understanding and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>super knowledgeable they know everything</p>
<p>about life and</p>
<p>everything about you</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve seen something like that</p>
<p>and someone</p>
<p>wants to talk to you and tell you that they&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>a guy in the</p>
<p>cloud with a harp</p>
<p>who are you to tell him that he&rsquo;s full of shit</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about something</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve actually experienced that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually experienced that&rsquo;s way more fucking crazy</p>
<p>than angels with wings and a dude in a</p>
<p>clouds with a big book of who gets in and who doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s way less</p>
<p>crazy than the</p>
<p>things that I&rsquo;ve actually experienced</p>
<p>and this thing that</p>
<p>you actually</p>
<p>experience when you die this DMT</p>
<p>is stuff that</p>
<p>when you die</p>
<p>this is what your</p>
<p>brain produces when you&rsquo;re in heavy REM</p>
<p>sleep this is what your</p>
<p>brain produces a natural</p>
<p>part of human</p>
<p>neurochemistry</p>
<p>and it lets you see something way crazier than what</p>
<p>these religious people are talking about</p>
<p>so who am I to say that there&rsquo;s no God</p>
<p>that maybe there is a fucking village in the</p>
<p>clouds maybe it&rsquo;s all true</p>
<p>but just studying</p>
<p>the actual words</p>
<p>if you know the history of how the</p>
<p>Bible was made the</p>
<p>ancient Hebrew which</p>
<p>would be the original Old Testament was written in</p>
<p>the original</p>
<p>Bible written in ancient Hebrew was</p>
<p>that to this day they only know</p>
<p>3 out of 4 of</p>
<p>those words</p>
<p>to this day</p>
<p>like today 25</p>
<p>of the words in ancient Hebrew they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>who the fuck knows</p>
<p>not only that there was no numbers in ancient Hebrew</p>
<p>letters doubled as numbers</p>
<p>so like the letter A</p>
<p>was also the number one</p>
<p>and there was numerical</p>
<p>value to words</p>
<p>that is completely lost in the</p>
<p>translation to</p>
<p>Greek and to Latin like</p>
<p>the word love and the word god</p>
<p>have the same</p>
<p>numerical value</p>
<p>and this numerical</p>
<p>value the value of</p>
<p>these words</p>
<p>it was very important to the</p>
<p>translation of</p>
<p>what it was meant</p>
<p>all that is missing</p>
<p>when they translated</p>
<p>that and then eventually to English all that&rsquo;s missing</p>
<p>and then you got the New Testament</p>
<p>which is just</p>
<p>complete wackiness because</p>
<p>Constantine</p>
<p>who wasn&rsquo;t even a fucking Christian created this</p>
<p>and this is just</p>
<p>clearly a ploy to try to control people</p>
<p>Constantine got together with a</p>
<p>bunch of bishops and they</p>
<p>wrote it all out</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stuff that they left in and</p>
<p>stuff that they took out</p>
<p>so the New Testament</p>
<p>which is literally made hundreds of years</p>
<p>after Christ was supposed to be dead</p>
<p>who the fuck knows what that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about who knows</p>
<p>but all you need to know is the guy even</p>
<p>wrote it wasn&rsquo;t even a Christian</p>
<p>delete like</p>
<p>right before he died he converted I believe</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>it was very</p>
<p>clear Constantine</p>
<p>wanted he was an</p>
<p>emperor he wanted to control people</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s best at it&rsquo;s so good at controlling</p>
<p>people that you&rsquo;ll let pedophiles fuck your kids</p>
<p>because they have the fucking</p>
<p>the magic Fairy Tale</p>
<p>golden ticket it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mind boggling</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s mind boggling that this</p>
<p>goofy fuck in a</p>
<p>crazy outfit this cult leader</p>
<p>gets special</p>
<p>treatment they&rsquo;ll make fun of the Moonies</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll make fun of</p>
<p>Scientologist</p>
<p>but the fucking</p>
<p>Pope on TV somehow another gets to be national news</p>
<p>this crazy fuck who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not allowed to have sex who hangs out with a bunch of</p>
<p>crazy fucks</p>
<p>who aren&rsquo;t allowed to have sex</p>
<p>and every rock you fucking pick up there&rsquo;s a priest</p>
<p>fucking a kid</p>
<p>underneath it</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>throughout their entire organization there</p>
<p>are thousands and thousands and thousands of cases</p>
<p>every fucking year new ones pop up</p>
<p>every fucking year some new scandal</p>
<p>about how they</p>
<p>knew this guy was fucking kids and so they</p>
<p>moved them to New Mexico or some shit</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really shocking</p>
<p>that Catholic</p>
<p>people are even</p>
<p>going to church anymore it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely shocking that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still people that they trip</p>
<p>just the sheer weight of its own bullshit</p>
<p>should have</p>
<p>collapsed the Catholic religion a long fucking time ago</p>
<p>and this is</p>
<p>coming from someone who was raised a Catholic</p>
<p>I went to Catholic school</p>
<p>when I was in</p>
<p>first grade</p>
<p>one year I went to Catholic school</p>
<p>and it was such a fucking horrendous nightmare</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>second grade</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember it</p>
<p>I remember first</p>
<p>grade though</p>
<p>like a motherfucker</p>
<p>because first</p>
<p>grade was the only year that I was in Catholic</p>
<p>school I remember this fucking cunt</p>
<p>Sister Mary Josephine this evil evil woman</p>
<p>used to tell you</p>
<p>that if you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get your homework done you have to sit on a nail in the</p>
<p>closet overnight</p>
<p>she would smack you in the head</p>
<p>I mean it was real shit</p>
<p>if you cried if you were upset</p>
<p>about something she</p>
<p>would make fun of you</p>
<p>you know look at this one crying</p>
<p>she was just</p>
<p>no compassion no love no friendship</p>
<p>no warmth it was all</p>
<p>evil it was all</p>
<p>anger and evil</p>
<p>and that is what that relationship is it is unnatural</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not real</p>
<p>this relationship to life</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re a person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s in charge of some nonsense fairy tale</p>
<p>and because</p>
<p>of that you get to shit on people and yell at</p>
<p>their kids and hit</p>
<p>their fucking kids</p>
<p>and treat them like shit</p>
<p>because you somehow or another are special</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re one of</p>
<p>those people that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t fuck</p>
<p>and you have</p>
<p>you know what you have more access to God and no</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even have more access you don&rsquo;t have anything</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the craziest</p>
<p>most ridiculous cult ever and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still going on</p>
<p>and if that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a damning condemnation of</p>
<p>human beings in</p>
<p>human culture</p>
<p>today in 2010</p>
<p>with the age</p>
<p>of information with the internet with all this that we</p>
<p>still have the Catholic religion that that</p>
<p>stupid shit is</p>
<p>still around</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s mind boggling</p>
<p>without a doubt if there is a God</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not what He wants</p>
<p>if there is</p>
<p>a God what God is is the energy that creates everything</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>might not be a conscious</p>
<p>thing or it</p>
<p>might be all conscious</p>
<p>things together as one thing</p>
<p>in some sort of a</p>
<p>framework that</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t even recognize because it&rsquo;s so big</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so great that literally</p>
<p>when someone some hippie</p>
<p>says hey you are God and god&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>what if that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>what if that really is true</p>
<p>what if our</p>
<p>purpose on this life has</p>
<p>shielded us from that recognition because</p>
<p>we have to go</p>
<p>through whatever we have to go through like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re here for a reason that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pushing humanity and</p>
<p>human culture and</p>
<p>human innovation</p>
<p>forward for a reason</p>
<p>you know probably some sort of a fucking</p>
<p>some sort of a technological</p>
<p>thing that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna create that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna enter us into the new age</p>
<p>but if that&rsquo;s the case and so</p>
<p>that we just lack the perception to really</p>
<p>understand that we&rsquo;re in tune with</p>
<p>everything with the</p>
<p>whole world</p>
<p>then that makes sense that</p>
<p>everything is God</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>feeling that you get when you do mushrooms</p>
<p>when you do mushrooms</p>
<p>you get this feeling of connectedness</p>
<p>that you are attached when you do DMT as well</p>
<p>which is very similar to mushrooms in</p>
<p>what it is chemically</p>
<p>what DMT is is dimethyltryptamine</p>
<p>what mushrooms are</p>
<p>cubensis mushrooms is</p>
<p>4 foxboro loxy</p>
<p>and end dimethyltryptamine so</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>closely chemically related and</p>
<p>you have this</p>
<p>intense feeling of</p>
<p>connection with</p>
<p>everything with people</p>
<p>with the friends</p>
<p>in your life with animals with wilderness with I mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why they say do mushrooms and go into nature</p>
<p>because when you do</p>
<p>when you you</p>
<p>know have some mushrooms and you&rsquo;re laying in a</p>
<p>in the woods</p>
<p>you know in a plot of trees</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll you like you feel like</p>
<p>the energy of the trees it&rsquo;s like some Avatar type shit</p>
<p>like you really feel</p>
<p>like the fucking Tree of Souls communicating with you</p>
<p>I think that</p>
<p>our main problem</p>
<p>as human beings is that we are in</p>
<p>a stage of evolution</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re in an</p>
<p>adolescent stage</p>
<p>and we are certainly</p>
<p>passing where we used to be and</p>
<p>just our potential</p>
<p>for evolving</p>
<p>above the basic</p>
<p>fight or flight instincts and</p>
<p>our potential for</p>
<p>evolving above just animal brutality and</p>
<p>anger and jealousy and all</p>
<p>these things that we</p>
<p>think that we need in order to</p>
<p>compete and survive</p>
<p>we have potential to rise above that</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what yoga is all</p>
<p>about and that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>meditation is all</p>
<p>about and isolation tanks</p>
<p>people who are a</p>
<p>psychedelic enthusiast</p>
<p>what that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about is this</p>
<p>this struggle</p>
<p>up this slippery</p>
<p>slope to get to the top to have just a little</p>
<p>better view</p>
<p>of what the</p>
<p>world could be</p>
<p>and I think</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the potential that we have inside of us</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all moving towards that</p>
<p>you know human</p>
<p>understanding</p>
<p>the idea of</p>
<p>human enlightenment</p>
<p>you know this</p>
<p>quest to get your shit together</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all moving away from</p>
<p>these nonsensical animal instincts</p>
<p>to something higher and more</p>
<p>evolved and I</p>
<p>think that potential</p>
<p>is the only good</p>
<p>thing that human beings have</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like we have this potential</p>
<p>for one side or the</p>
<p>other we have this potential to be like</p>
<p>an evil government that corrupts its</p>
<p>citizens or</p>
<p>we have this potential to be a brother</p>
<p>we have this potential to be a</p>
<p>sister we have</p>
<p>this potential to be</p>
<p>someone who loves</p>
<p>you like they love family like they love themselves</p>
<p>you know I mean</p>
<p>I have a buddy that as a kid and we were talking</p>
<p>about babies recently</p>
<p>and we were just joking around he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>comic as well</p>
<p>gene Pompa last night</p>
<p>at the improv</p>
<p>and we just talking</p>
<p>about and I&rsquo;ve had this conversation with</p>
<p>other people too about</p>
<p>how it makes you like so much a nicer person</p>
<p>and I said that like man if everybody</p>
<p>treated everybody the way I</p>
<p>treat my daughter what a fucking beautiful</p>
<p>world we would live in</p>
<p>it would just be a</p>
<p>world of warmth</p>
<p>and friendship</p>
<p>you know if we just had a pill</p>
<p>that made you love everybody the way I love my</p>
<p>daughter and we do have a pill like that it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>ecstasy but that shit&rsquo;s terrible for you</p>
<p>and the next</p>
<p>day you feel like shit and it hurts your head but</p>
<p>if we figured out a way</p>
<p>and maybe we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do that</p>
<p>I mean maybe that&rsquo;s what the next</p>
<p>stage of evolution really is all</p>
<p>about maybe it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>evolution pill</p>
<p>know maybe you</p>
<p>know some people take the</p>
<p>evolution vaccine and some people won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>shoot your arm with some shit it lasts like 6 months</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s some vaccination</p>
<p>against stupidity</p>
<p>some vaccination</p>
<p>against against</p>
<p>nonsense against</p>
<p>a lack of understanding</p>
<p>and appreciation of the fact that we are here</p>
<p>in this temporary situation as one gigantic hive</p>
<p>one super organism</p>
<p>one super organism</p>
<p>and that the more love you</p>
<p>spread out the more positive energy you spread out</p>
<p>the more you get back</p>
<p>you know the more</p>
<p>it comes back to affect you</p>
<p>and it goes</p>
<p>out in ripples because the people that you affect</p>
<p>they affect</p>
<p>other people as well</p>
<p>and the more positive</p>
<p>you spread out like</p>
<p>literally you can change your world</p>
<p>you can change the</p>
<p>world of the people that you come in contact with</p>
<p>you know I think that is what</p>
<p>human beings are slowly</p>
<p>starting to realize and that may be what God really is</p>
<p>what God might be is everything</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>is a bunch of dudes in fucking</p>
<p>robes that want to have sex with your kids okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not God</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s nonsense</p>
<p>and the fact that</p>
<p>these fucking presidential candidates</p>
<p>and all these</p>
<p>knuckleheads that wanna be</p>
<p>world leaders and they want to</p>
<p>guide us towards</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>guiding us towards anything it&rsquo;s business as</p>
<p>usual there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>evolution whatsoever in the political process</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no evolution whatsoever amongst</p>
<p>these fuckheads</p>
<p>that talk they are</p>
<p>decades and decades behind the progressive</p>
<p>American culture</p>
<p>the people that are at the</p>
<p>front of the line of</p>
<p>thinking these</p>
<p>motherfuckers are decades behind</p>
<p>you know that this idea of religious freedom yes I</p>
<p>agree yes you</p>
<p>should have the freedom to</p>
<p>study religiously</p>
<p>you should have the freedom to do whatever you want</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t defeat</p>
<p>the Flying Spaghetti</p>
<p>Monster that&rsquo;s your thing</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s fine you know</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t take it seriously</p>
<p>like you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>expect someone</p>
<p>who is I mean that is the</p>
<p>whole idea of the</p>
<p>separation of church and</p>
<p>state the whole idea is like some sort of concede</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s conceding somehow that okay</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re allowed to believe</p>
<p>ridiculous shit</p>
<p>how about this how</p>
<p>about we just</p>
<p>leave all the religion out</p>
<p>and all we concentrate on is</p>
<p>how things are run business how we</p>
<p>treat each other</p>
<p>what laws we enforce how</p>
<p>you make sure that people aren&rsquo;t being</p>
<p>victimized these</p>
<p>fucking politicians and</p>
<p>these newspapers and all</p>
<p>these people that really follow all this pope bullshit</p>
<p>they just add credence to it because</p>
<p>knuckleheads read</p>
<p>about in the news</p>
<p>so they think it&rsquo;s legitimate</p>
<p>I had a conversation with someone</p>
<p>where they were saying that</p>
<p>we were talking</p>
<p>about cults</p>
<p>and I said well I was</p>
<p>watching a documentary and it was</p>
<p>really fascinating it was a documentary on Christianity</p>
<p>and they kept referring it to the cult</p>
<p>of Christianity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how they were referring it to</p>
<p>in this very</p>
<p>scientific documentary</p>
<p>and this woman was very</p>
<p>upset she&rsquo;s like Christianity is not a cult</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>how can you say it&rsquo;s not a cult</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like well because</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have a cult that has billions of people in it</p>
<p>yes you do it&rsquo;s just a bigger call</p>
<p>like if you have a cult that has</p>
<p>3 people if you could trick 3 people</p>
<p>you can trick</p>
<p>3,000,000 okay</p>
<p>if you can find</p>
<p>3 people dumb enough to believe your wackiness</p>
<p>and they let you fuck them and they wear purple Nikes</p>
<p>cause you tell them that&rsquo;s the sacred color</p>
<p>if you get 3 people to do that</p>
<p>they really believe it they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get more people to believe it</p>
<p>we are all going through this life</p>
<p>completely clueless</p>
<p>these we are like</p>
<p>people in a</p>
<p>spaceship that woke up from hyper sleep</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going through the</p>
<p>the manuals and no one knows how to run the ship</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we are like and</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a few of us that are older</p>
<p>that are pretending to the younger people listen don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry we&rsquo;ve got this everything&rsquo;s going to be fine</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have a meeting with Congress</p>
<p>gonna work all this time</p>
<p>and these people are trying to placate the rest of us</p>
<p>who are just like them</p>
<p>and no one knows what the fuck is</p>
<p>going on so anybody that</p>
<p>steps up and tells you that they have all the answers</p>
<p>that God wants this for you god wants that</p>
<p>no you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>those are the</p>
<p>enemy anybody that says they have the answers</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re your enemy</p>
<p>and anybody who wants your money</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re your</p>
<p>enemy too you know</p>
<p>give me a fucking show</p>
<p>alright don&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>stand there</p>
<p>and recite some</p>
<p>stupid Latin</p>
<p>shit and pass on a basket</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re too lazy to work for a living you fuck no</p>
<p>if you want to be the real messenger the word of God</p>
<p>you would be asking for</p>
<p>money okay stop it</p>
<p>people would be giving</p>
<p>money to you because they love you</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t have a fucking</p>
<p>basket you pass around make everybody feel guilty</p>
<p>fuck you that&rsquo;s nonsense that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>silly goddamn nonsense and</p>
<p>until we acknowledge that</p>
<p>until we acknowledge that</p>
<p>that is our own insecurities that are asking us to</p>
<p>search for an</p>
<p>answer to something that&rsquo;s impossible to answer</p>
<p>to acknowledge</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re fucked we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>spinning our wheels</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in the same spot we&rsquo;ve always been</p>
<p>you know and that is the problem the real problem is</p>
<p>everybody wants to pretend that there&rsquo;s an answer</p>
<p>to something</p>
<p>that you cannot answer</p>
<p>there is no answer it is</p>
<p>absolutely impossible and</p>
<p>if there is a God</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>so much more complex than you</p>
<p>could ever possibly wrap your fucking head around</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll tell you what it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>Adam and Eve</p>
<p>okay it&rsquo;s not god made 2 people</p>
<p>and you know they fucked and they had kids and</p>
<p>their kids started fucking each other</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what Adam and Eve is there&rsquo;s only 2 people because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like any</p>
<p>child with a simple</p>
<p>grasp of mathematics and 5 minutes to</p>
<p>think about it</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d say okay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna tell you a</p>
<p>story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p>you tell me what you</p>
<p>think is wrong with that</p>
<p>they would go okay if Adam and Eve</p>
<p>made people</p>
<p>everybody came from Adam and</p>
<p>Eve everybody the</p>
<p>whole world okay</p>
<p>if Adam and Eve made people so they had kids</p>
<p>and the kids were like they were brothers and</p>
<p>sisters yep</p>
<p>how do they make more people</p>
<p>there we go no</p>
<p>they fucked each other they fucked each other</p>
<p>the Adam fucked the kids and Eve</p>
<p>fucked the kids and the kids fucked each other</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where people came from</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s 2010</p>
<p>no one has any fucking answer no one goddamn it</p>
<p>except maybe Gangsta gangsta has got the answer</p>
<p>I like this I don&rsquo;t know who Big L is but I like them</p>
<p>big L recipes</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>long answer to a short question</p>
<p>fuck the Pope</p>
<p>fuck all those dummies</p>
<p>fuck anybody that tells you they&rsquo;ve got it wired</p>
<p>no no no stupid</p>
<p>no you don&rsquo;t have it wired and you</p>
<p>gotta get a real job now okay it&rsquo;s 2000 and fucking 10</p>
<p>if the whole</p>
<p>world got on mushrooms the Catholic religion</p>
<p>would implode okay</p>
<p>they would have to go out and</p>
<p>start kidnapping kids to fuck</p>
<p>cause nobody would bring their kids to him anymore</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a corrupt</p>
<p>criminal organization of kid fuckers</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it is</p>
<p>do I have any idea how Lost ends no</p>
<p>those fucks I&rsquo;ve been trying to not tune in</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be on Adam Crowes</p>
<p>podcast real soon I think next week</p>
<p>actually I&rsquo;ll tell you right now</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m on the fucking internet hollow</p>
<p>how you like them apples</p>
<p>I love the Internet this is easily my favorite</p>
<p>human creation I&rsquo;m so addicted</p>

<p>what time he puts it up so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my answer to that but I&rsquo;ll be doing it next</p>
<p>Tuesday the 23rd all right more questions</p>
<p>bad Bobby says Joe I once read</p>
<p>if they legalized all drugs it</p>
<p>could cost the USA</p>
<p>150 000 good jobs and cops</p>
<p>lawyers and so forth</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true but I believe the War on Drugs is a make up</p>
<p>make work project forget</p>
<p>about if they&rsquo;re getting some profits and selling them</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s true but it</p>
<p>sounded right yes</p>
<p>definitely the war on drugs</p>
<p>is definitely</p>
<p>look between</p>
<p>the private prisons</p>
<p>and between</p>
<p>law enforcement</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an industry in keeping drugs illegal</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>about protecting you</p>
<p>you know some drugs yes it is you know</p>
<p>when they go and</p>
<p>close down Crystal meth labs</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s a fucking danger</p>
<p>because crystal meth</p>
<p>makes people it</p>
<p>completely fucks with</p>
<p>their judgment makes them insane</p>
<p>look what it did to Jesse</p>
<p>James he fucked that</p>
<p>bitch with a</p>
<p>tattoo on her head</p>
<p>I guarantee that dude is doing methane</p>
<p>fuck there there&rsquo;s no way sober</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t fuck</p>
<p>chicks with</p>
<p>tattoos on their head when you&rsquo;re sober</p>
<p>when you see a</p>
<p>bitch that has</p>
<p>pray for Sinners</p>
<p>tattooed on her fucking forehead you go</p>
<p>what and she&rsquo;s ugly</p>
<p>oh yeah let me</p>
<p>stick my rod dick inside you</p>
<p>now that guy was doing drugs</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s drugs that are bad for you okay and crystal</p>
<p>meth is one of them it&rsquo;s a terrible terrible drug</p>
<p>you know heroin&rsquo;s another one I mean I&rsquo;ve seen cocaine</p>
<p>turn people into they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>they become like like</p>
<p>roaches they become like bugs</p>
<p>you know that like they don&rsquo;t they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>thinking about you man they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just trying to get that shit how do I get that shit</p>
<p>you know they</p>
<p>literally get</p>
<p>black shark eyes they turn dead on the inside man</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s drugs that are terrible for you and</p>
<p>those drugs yeah</p>
<p>I could see an argument for them being illegal I</p>
<p>could see an argument for us</p>
<p>doing something</p>
<p>about the people that sell them because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>damaging people it&rsquo;s dangerous</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other drugs like mushrooms and pot</p>
<p>if you get caught with</p>
<p>those things man it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter those are</p>
<p>still illegal drugs</p>
<p>as a matter of fact they&rsquo;re more illegal than heroin</p>
<p>do you know that</p>
<p>schedule One drugs for</p>
<p>the most part are the drugs that really have like use</p>
<p>schedule One is the most illegal</p>
<p>schedule One is DMT</p>
<p>which your own</p>
<p>brain produces so as Terrence</p>
<p>Mckenney said</p>
<p>he said everyone&rsquo;s holding</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>really what it is you are</p>
<p>in production</p>
<p>and in you are in</p>
<p>possession of</p>
<p>a really illegal substance</p>
<p>the number one</p>
<p>the schedule one</p>
<p>DMT marijuana</p>
<p>schedule one</p>
<p>no has ever died a pot ever</p>
<p>do you know what it can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>the only way pot is</p>
<p>going to kill you is if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>standing on the</p>
<p>wrong side of the fence</p>
<p>when one of</p>
<p>those Mexican drug helicopters</p>
<p>comes over and pushes a bail out</p>
<p>and it clubs you on the fucking head</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you die from pot</p>
<p>other than that you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna die from pot</p>
<p>you might think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dying but you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna fall asleep and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be fine no one&rsquo;s fucking died of it ever</p>
<p>but yet still pot is</p>
<p>schedule one</p>
<p>mushrooms same</p>
<p>thing I&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>heard of anybody</p>
<p>dying from mushrooms you can</p>
<p>definitely die if you eat poison</p>
<p>mushrooms but poison mushrooms by the way are legal</p>
<p>and you can</p>
<p>have poison mushrooms all around your backyard you can</p>
<p>munch on them all day</p>
<p>and fucking die of a</p>
<p>heart attack and nobody gives a shit</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s gonna have it&rsquo;s not gonna be</p>
<p>a big inquest no one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna go crazy</p>
<p>but if you if you put</p>
<p>psilocybin mushrooms in your yard</p>
<p>and the cops come and find them growing in your yard</p>
<p>they will lock you in a fucking cage</p>
<p>even though</p>
<p>psilocybin mushrooms</p>
<p>they can make you go</p>
<p>crazy if you do too</p>
<p>many of them and if you have a weak mental constitution</p>
<p>I could see you</p>
<p>going crazy for mushrooms</p>
<p>just too much information too much realization</p>
<p>but you could go crazy</p>
<p>from anything</p>
<p>you can go crazy from paint</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>could you could huff</p>
<p>paint and you know</p>
<p>sniff paint and</p>
<p>blow your fucking</p>
<p>brains out you can go</p>
<p>crazy for anything</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>some people are weak and fragile</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>any really extreme</p>
<p>experience can fuck them up</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an ant</p>
<p>that I think it&rsquo;s called an iron ant</p>
<p>I forget the name of the ant but this ant</p>
<p>bites you and the</p>
<p>venom is so intense and horrifying</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s been described as</p>
<p>slamming your arm</p>
<p>into a car door</p>
<p>for an hour</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it feels like</p>
<p>just slamming your arm imagine what that&rsquo;ll feel like</p>
<p>and it lasts for 24 hours</p>
<p>what so this intense insane throbbing like</p>
<p>literally you&rsquo;re getting ripped</p>
<p>apart like someone slamming a door on your arm</p>
<p>and it lasts a whole day</p>
<p>and the experience is so traumatic</p>
<p>that some people when they come out of it they are</p>
<p>never the same again they&rsquo;re just a shell</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just so fucked up</p>
<p>they could not get through the pain of one</p>
<p>full 24 hour period under so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some shit</p>
<p>in the world that could fuck you up okay that&rsquo;s not why</p>
<p>marijuana is illegal that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not why mushrooms are illegal that&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re illegal</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to keep you from them they don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want a society</p>
<p>that is questioning</p>
<p>leadership they don&rsquo;t want a society</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>other problem the people that are in power</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>using these</p>
<p>things throughout</p>
<p>human history shamans</p>
<p>have been the leaders of</p>
<p>tribes and shamans have been the ones that</p>
<p>the tribe will go to when the</p>
<p>tribe has troubles</p>
<p>and what the shamans are were</p>
<p>people who had a lot of</p>
<p>experience in</p>
<p>navigating psychedelic dimensions</p>
<p>in the Amazon</p>
<p>when you know they</p>
<p>would all sit around and</p>
<p>drink ayahuasca</p>
<p>ayahuasca is</p>
<p>an herb like a tea that they brew</p>
<p>with that that produces DMT and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>ordinarily DMT is not you can&rsquo;t drink it</p>
<p>because it gets</p>
<p>broken down when you take it in orally when you eat it</p>
<p>it gets broken down by something in your stomach called</p>
<p>monoamine oxidase</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s produced in your gut and</p>
<p>this ayahuasca</p>
<p>was a way that they figured out how to extract DMT and</p>
<p>a mono aiming</p>
<p>oxidase inhibitor</p>
<p>from another</p>
<p>plant it&rsquo;s really fucking crazy</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been doing this for 10,000 years</p>
<p>and a place</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know 250,000 plus different species of</p>
<p>plants they figured</p>
<p>out a way to combine 2 to make this incredible brew</p>
<p>that lets you communicate with with the afterlife</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>which by the way is totally illegal</p>
<p>you know I mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a mess you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a real</p>
<p>fucking mess when when you</p>
<p>start think about</p>
<p>what what it</p>
<p>really is because what it really is is people</p>
<p>keeping other people</p>
<p>from having an experience</p>
<p>and the reasoning</p>
<p>for it the reason why is not because they</p>
<p>think that this person</p>
<p>if they have that experience</p>
<p>gonna make life difficult for me they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna come after me they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna hurt my family no</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing it because they can profit</p>
<p>off this person not having that experience</p>
<p>if I say that something</p>
<p>is illegal and I set forth laws and I say if you cross</p>
<p>this boundary and you do this behavior and you you know</p>
<p>you violate my law</p>
<p>I get to lock you in a cage I get to make</p>
<p>money from lock you in</p>
<p>a cage not only that I get to employ people that will</p>
<p>now they have a job</p>
<p>their job is to go</p>
<p>after people</p>
<p>that are doing what I said they couldn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>and get them and kidnap them and put them in a cage</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having with marijuana and mushroom busts and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re telling someone that</p>
<p>by your judgment</p>
<p>they shouldn&rsquo;t have that experience</p>
<p>and so you say well if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna make such</p>
<p>an extreme judgment that judgment has to be</p>
<p>based on facts</p>
<p>right no no it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to be</p>
<p>based on facts of course it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because if it was</p>
<p>then marijuana</p>
<p>would have been</p>
<p>legal in the 1950s</p>
<p>I mean it would have been</p>
<p>legal in the when</p>
<p>when they passed the</p>
<p>sweeping Schedule One</p>
<p>Psychedelics</p>
<p>Act of 1970 I believe it was when they made</p>
<p>everything illegal</p>
<p>they would have</p>
<p>they would have had to provide some</p>
<p>reasoning for making mushrooms illegal some reasoning</p>
<p>for making marijuana illegal and it would been</p>
<p>scientific and</p>
<p>would have been medical</p>
<p>but the problem is</p>
<p>every single fucking medical</p>
<p>study that&rsquo;s ever been done</p>
<p>about marijuana shows that it&rsquo;s relatively harmless</p>
<p>I mean you can ruin your life with anything you</p>
<p>can ruin your life with cheeseburgers if you want to</p>
<p>like I always</p>
<p>talk about like</p>
<p>bottles you can take</p>
<p>a bottle and bottles can hold a nice delicious drink</p>
<p>or you can take a bottle</p>
<p>and you could</p>
<p>stuff it up your ass and</p>
<p>throw yourself down a flight of</p>
<p>stairs and bleed to</p>
<p>death it doesn&rsquo;t mean that bottle</p>
<p>should be illegal</p>
<p>the real fucking problem is that we are</p>
<p>allowing people</p>
<p>to victimize</p>
<p>other people for</p>
<p>profit and that&rsquo;s what the War on Drugs is all about</p>
<p>and the reason why the war on drugs works at all</p>
<p>is because the people responsible</p>
<p>the cops and the lawyers</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not doing drugs</p>
<p>if they were doing drugs if they were doing the</p>
<p>right drugs</p>
<p>they were doing mushrooms and they were smoking pot</p>
<p>they would be nothing</p>
<p>it would all stop</p>
<p>they would have to stop</p>
<p>if you do the correct amount of mushroom dose</p>
<p>you would realize that in</p>
<p>victimizing people</p>
<p>you are victimizing yourself</p>
<p>you are creating a terrible</p>
<p>stream of karma</p>
<p>you are ruining lives</p>
<p>for nothing you are ruining lives for something that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with you</p>
<p>and something that&rsquo;s been around</p>
<p>in terms of</p>
<p>for marijuana</p>
<p>and mushrooms and</p>
<p>ayahuasca tens of thousands of years of human use</p>
<p>and as I said in</p>
<p>those indigenous cultures</p>
<p>the shaman was the one who made the decisions</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because this is the guy that had the most</p>
<p>experience in</p>
<p>these matters of the</p>
<p>spirit world</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have that anymore now we have the opposite</p>
<p>we have leaders that</p>
<p>if we find out they&rsquo;re doing mushrooms we&rsquo;d be shocked</p>
<p>we would want them removed from office</p>
<p>if Obama had a</p>
<p>press conference on</p>
<p>Monday and said</p>
<p>I got together with my wife the</p>
<p>other day we did 5</p>
<p>grams of mushrooms and we went to the mountains</p>
<p>and I really</p>
<p>start to think</p>
<p>about our country</p>
<p>everybody be like what</p>
<p>the fuck are you talking about</p>
<p>that would be the most beautiful</p>
<p>thing that he</p>
<p>could ever say</p>
<p>if you could say I just took something that allowed me</p>
<p>to literally</p>
<p>tune into the</p>
<p>stream of love that is</p>
<p>god that is the energy of the universe that is</p>
<p>Mother Gaia</p>
<p>I connected myself to all that is loving in the world</p>
<p>and I came back with some</p>
<p>revelations and some thoughts</p>
<p>about how we</p>
<p>could lead our</p>
<p>culture better</p>
<p>how we could be kinder to the rest of the</p>
<p>world how instead of</p>
<p>going all these</p>
<p>places to control the resources and to</p>
<p>to ruin them how</p>
<p>about we introduce them to this spiritual realm</p>
<p>how about we introduce the whole</p>
<p>world to mushrooms</p>
<p>how about we</p>
<p>produce them in mass</p>
<p>quantities and slowly</p>
<p>start to open</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s eyes up to the fact that it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a lack of resources that we have in this country</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a gluttonous fucking gigantic</p>
<p>group at the top</p>
<p>that are fucking in raping the world</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that we have</p>
<p>not enough resources to run the life</p>
<p>that we need</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have enough resources to run the life</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re living</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have to live like this</p>
<p>this is all nonsense</p>
<p>we live a non agriculturally</p>
<p>based life we live a life</p>
<p>where we rely</p>
<p>on fossil fuels and</p>
<p>rely on petroleum</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s many many</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>could be done with</p>
<p>plants that we&rsquo;re doing right now</p>
<p>if marijuana was legal</p>
<p>first of all just hemp as</p>
<p>for use for oil</p>
<p>and use for textiles and use for</p>
<p>for you can make</p>
<p>houses out of it</p>
<p>and you can you can fucking fuel cars with it you could</p>
<p>build cars with it lotus actually made a fucking car</p>
<p>with a instead of carbon</p>
<p>fiber or fiberglass</p>
<p>they made the fucking shell out of hemp</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s all possible</p>
<p>we just can&rsquo;t live the way we&rsquo;re living right now</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>to effectively reset</p>
<p>civilization</p>
<p>better than</p>
<p>psychedelics</p>
<p>but meanwhile</p>
<p>saying that makes you</p>
<p>sound like a retard like I&rsquo;m listening to my own</p>
<p>self and I&rsquo;m like if I didn&rsquo;t do drugs if I had</p>
<p>never you know done mushrooms or anything like that I</p>
<p>heard a guy talking like this like who the</p>
<p>freak is this</p>
<p>idiot like what</p>
<p>could you how</p>
<p>could you possibly say that</p>
<p>you you think you have all the answers</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the answers but I do have</p>
<p>a possible door to the answers</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>think I think</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>experiences are</p>
<p>and these guys that are running for president</p>
<p>they will deny that to the end they will</p>
<p>they will you know</p>
<p>Obama had this fucking</p>
<p>thing recently</p>
<p>where was a town hall meeting</p>
<p>and he got all</p>
<p>these questions from the Internet</p>
<p>and the number one question</p>
<p>the number one question</p>
<p>was marijuana</p>
<p>legalization</p>
<p>and every other</p>
<p>issue that was being discussed</p>
<p>that day whether it was healthcare or anything else</p>
<p>he gave these</p>
<p>really well thought out in</p>
<p>depth answers</p>
<p>but it came to the marijuana question was like ho ho ho</p>
<p>well I don&rsquo;t know what that says</p>
<p>about this group here ho</p>
<p>ho ho they said no I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s a good idea</p>
<p>really you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s a good idea you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a good idea to stop suppressing people</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>idea to not jail people for having a fucking experience</p>
<p>to not jail people for selling a</p>
<p>plant a naturally growing</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never killed anyone</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a good idea to reverse an evil fucked up corrupt law</p>
<p>that is helping people with</p>
<p>the worst karma ever</p>
<p>imprison people from nothing</p>
<p>well you sir need some fucking mushrooms</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>we have a whole</p>
<p>group of people running this</p>
<p>fucking country and none of them are doing mushrooms</p>
<p>I would like to have a talk show</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about this on stage</p>
<p>I wanted to have a talk show</p>
<p>where I make people do mushrooms with me</p>
<p>and it would be called</p>
<p>do Mushrooms with Joe Rogan</p>
<p>and we have on you know</p>
<p>like people that like</p>
<p>I mean you want to know a real truth serum</p>
<p>mushrooms is the best</p>
<p>truth Sam you get you once that fucking wave hits you</p>
<p>that wave of</p>
<p>of alien information and the the</p>
<p>wave of love and the connectivity and when you see the</p>
<p>fiber of the very universe all around you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>start talking</p>
<p>and if I could get</p>
<p>you know like Ken Starr and</p>
<p>Dick Cheney and</p>
<p>could you imagine</p>
<p>could you imagine if</p>
<p>those guys like if people sued them</p>
<p>and people you know</p>
<p>you know because</p>
<p>like look there&rsquo;s a lot of people that want to take</p>
<p>them to trial for war crimes</p>
<p>especially Dick</p>
<p>Cheney we think</p>
<p>about the fact that Dick</p>
<p>Cheney was a CEO of Halliburton</p>
<p>and then you know he becomes the</p>
<p>Vice President of the United States</p>
<p>we go to some</p>
<p>crazy fucking wars</p>
<p>where Halliburton</p>
<p>gets the contracts and the wars are all</p>
<p>based on totally</p>
<p>false information</p>
<p>about weapons</p>
<p>of mass destruction there&rsquo;s people that say that</p>
<p>Dick Cheney was at the</p>
<p>helm of it he was lying</p>
<p>you could try that</p>
<p>motherfucker for wars against</p>
<p>crimes against</p>
<p>humanity you</p>
<p>could try him for that</p>
<p>and if he was convicted</p>
<p>and they said</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s one thing you can do to get out of it</p>
<p>you gotta you</p>
<p>gotta do the</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s Get let&rsquo;s Do Mushrooms with Joe Rogan show</p>
<p>and you have a guy like that like a</p>
<p>any any really fucked up</p>
<p>politician George Bush senior</p>
<p>George Bush Jr</p>
<p>You know anyone</p>
<p>like that sit them down and make them do mushrooms</p>
<p>make them realize that</p>
<p>just because you&rsquo;ve been living this life the same way</p>
<p>as everyone before you</p>
<p>as your father and all</p>
<p>these other corrupt politicians</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s justifiable</p>
<p>just because you can find</p>
<p>examples all around you of people who have done worse</p>
<p>and people who are doing the same things</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s supposed to continue</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>to there&rsquo;s got to be a way to stop it</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be stopping</p>
<p>with the evolution of culture</p>
<p>it seems to be the same</p>
<p>it seems to be the corruption</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s being exposed more</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t seem like it&rsquo;s put a</p>
<p>monkey wrench in it like they&rsquo;re just stopping</p>
<p>you know the financial</p>
<p>corruption involved in this bailout is staggering</p>
<p>and if you really want to hurt your head</p>
<p>you go and read some of</p>
<p>Matt Taibis</p>
<p>articles about it</p>
<p>it fucking hurts</p>
<p>like when you look at the</p>
<p>billions and trillions of dollars</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s going and how</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s being funded and</p>
<p>these guys are getting</p>
<p>bonuses and they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>bonuses but they don&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>money and the</p>
<p>money came from taxpayers but they were</p>
<p>owed the bonuses or</p>
<p>else they&rsquo;ll quit or why don&rsquo;t they fire them they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the ones that fuck this</p>
<p>thing up in the</p>
<p>first place</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s staggering I mean</p>
<p>literally our entire</p>
<p>civilization</p>
<p>is built on a</p>
<p>foundation of</p>
<p>unfixable bullshit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the only way I</p>
<p>think to restructure our society correctly</p>
<p>literally it</p>
<p>would have to be done by someone</p>
<p>other than us</p>
<p>because once</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s what the Constitution was all</p>
<p>about when there was the</p>
<p>birth of America</p>
<p>the idea of America was that we were</p>
<p>going to have</p>
<p>a separation of church and</p>
<p>state that we were</p>
<p>gonna have people that</p>
<p>could only run it for a few years and then they</p>
<p>would have to leave</p>
<p>we were gonna have</p>
<p>the will of the people and then it was</p>
<p>gonna be we were</p>
<p>gonna be free from all the imperialism</p>
<p>bullshit that we had to deal with in England and</p>
<p>in Europe but</p>
<p>after a while it just fell into the same</p>
<p>thing people</p>
<p>inherently if we&rsquo;re left</p>
<p>alone and we&rsquo;re just people the way we are</p>
<p>right now our</p>
<p>evolution our</p>
<p>cultural and social</p>
<p>evolution is so much slower</p>
<p>than the evolution of</p>
<p>technology what we&rsquo;re able to do</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re able to communicate with people all around the</p>
<p>world we&rsquo;re about</p>
<p>flying fucking tubes through the sky</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re able to</p>
<p>send video through the air</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re able to watch</p>
<p>television programs that are being broadcast from the</p>
<p>other side of the planet</p>
<p>I mean we have</p>
<p>this incredible technological capabilities but</p>
<p>socially we&rsquo;re just a bump</p>
<p>ahead of where we were in the 50s just a little</p>
<p>just a little</p>
<p>I mean it could be argued that we&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>slightly behind</p>
<p>where we were in the 70s</p>
<p>in comparison to like</p>
<p>you know if you</p>
<p>think about it like</p>
<p>as far as like</p>
<p>what kind of access to information they had back then</p>
<p>you know everybody was all</p>
<p>about love and fucking</p>
<p>peace and love</p>
<p>why is that</p>
<p>why was the 60s the late 60s</p>
<p>what was the drop off between then and here</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s drugs</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what it is</p>
<p>when all that Summer of Love all that Woodstock shit</p>
<p>they were all on acid</p>
<p>okay they&rsquo;re all on mushrooms they&rsquo;re all on peyote</p>
<p>they were high</p>
<p>as fuck and they were realizing that this way of living</p>
<p>the life that you know</p>
<p>leads you to be your dad is not</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s at when you</p>
<p>watch your dad drop dead of a fucking</p>
<p>heart attack at 55 and you scarcely can remember him</p>
<p>laughing 3 times ever</p>
<p>you know and you go</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m supposed to be that guy what the fuck is that</p>
<p>you know and then the Vietnam War and all the</p>
<p>disenchantment with</p>
<p>our government I mean that&rsquo;s what forced people</p>
<p>to more drugs that&rsquo;s what forced the</p>
<p>culture to change more</p>
<p>we need something like that we need something like that</p>
<p>right now because the way we&rsquo;re doing it we are just</p>
<p>spinning our fucking wheels</p>
<p>when the president wins the Nobel</p>
<p>Peace Prize and then</p>
<p>like a week</p>
<p>later sends</p>
<p>30,000 people</p>
<p>more into Afghanistan</p>
<p>you gotta go what the fuck</p>
<p>really you know</p>
<p>what the fuck you</p>
<p>think this is a good idea nobody</p>
<p>after the Vietnam</p>
<p>War thought the Vietnam War was a good idea</p>
<p>less people</p>
<p>are gonna think the Afghanistan war is a good idea</p>
<p>cause Afghanistan isn&rsquo;t even really the fucking country</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s like one city</p>
<p>and a hundred tribes</p>
<p>the way John McCain</p>
<p>describes Afghanistan he said</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s run the same way it was run when Alexander the</p>
<p>Great was around</p>
<p>I mean literally you have warlords</p>
<p>and they run</p>
<p>tribes and in between</p>
<p>these warlords</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a few Taliban</p>
<p>like sprinkled in the hills</p>
<p>and you know how we find out</p>
<p>about these Taliban</p>
<p>this is where it gets really funny</p>
<p>we give the warlords Viagra</p>
<p>because the warlords can&rsquo;t get it up anymore</p>
<p>and you know they want to</p>
<p>still be the warlord but you know</p>
<p>they got like</p>
<p>these 6 wives and</p>
<p>these chicks are like sitting around</p>
<p>come on when are you</p>
<p>gonna fuck me</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t fuck them so they take Viagra</p>
<p>now and the soldiers give them Viagra and they in</p>
<p>tune in turn</p>
<p>give them information</p>
<p>about the Taliban</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty funny shit</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>how long will the world ignore the people that are</p>
<p>dying of starvation I</p>
<p>think Sam Kennisson has the best answer to that</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you people live where the food is</p>
<p>okay let me see</p>
<p>tiger Woods is gully I don&rsquo;t know what that means</p>
<p>fuck James Tony</p>
<p>big L Recipes</p>
<p>oh Big L was</p>
<p>a rapper that was shot and killed in Harlem in 1999</p>
<p>thank you eternal</p>
<p>damn it&rsquo;s already almost 7 a fucking</p>
<p>clock we&rsquo;ve been doing this for an hour and 1/2</p>
<p>all right people</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see anything more interesting here</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m gonna go to back to Twitter</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna stay with you guys for another half an hour</p>
<p>oh someone thinks I can&rsquo;t recognize 2 dudes dicks</p>
<p>I claim early I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>proficient in identifying poor stars by the dicks</p>
<p>some fans might wonder if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>truly being honest because it seems kind of gay</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s this who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Peter North</p>
<p>Ron Jeremy rocko sir Freddie mmm</p>
<p>I would say the bottom one it looks a little like</p>
<p>Ron Jeremy and the top one</p>
<p>looks a little like Rocko Sir Freddie</p>
<p>but the top one could be the same guy in</p>
<p>which case I say both of Ron Jeremy am I right</p>
<p>sad so sad that I know all right twitter</p>
<p>she was on Twitter god damn it I love you too</p>
<p>Harris for Andrew you motherfucker</p>
<p>infiltrate the White House kitchen and mix psychedelics</p>
<p>in the food</p>
<p>mmm that might not be such a good idea to hear</p>
<p>about what happened in France I&rsquo;ll find the</p>
<p>article for you the CIA</p>
<p>the CIA put LSD</p>
<p>in they spiked</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put the it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s all over the Internet</p>
<p>not just one</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put a put one up on but if you just look up CIA</p>
<p>France LSD in Google you will find</p>
<p>many many many articles</p>
<p>about it I&rsquo;ll put it up on twitter right now</p>
<p>okay just just</p>
<p>threw it up on twitter</p>
<p>right there is some fascinating shit man</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t think that</p>
<p>dosing people with</p>
<p>acid is the answer</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s definitely not the way to go</p>
<p>I think any psychedelic drug</p>
<p>should be done if you&rsquo;re going to do it at all</p>
<p>with an understanding of what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing it with someone who knows</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re doing who&rsquo;s done it many times before</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what the role of a shaman is supposed to be</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>a shaman is supposed to be is someone who can give you</p>
<p>experience and help you and</p>
<p>guide you through</p>
<p>the experience of</p>
<p>literally leaving this</p>
<p>world I mean that&rsquo;s what psychedelics are all about</p>
<p>you know I mean everybody wants everybody thinks that</p>
<p>you know to really leave this world you&rsquo;re gonna get a</p>
<p>spaceship and you&rsquo;re gonna go to another planet</p>
<p>you can leave this world</p>
<p>from right here</p>
<p>you can leave this world in your own mind</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s much more possible to me</p>
<p>that the real</p>
<p>aliens that real alien life</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably way</p>
<p>weirder and way</p>
<p>more complicated than we&rsquo;ve got it broken down in the</p>
<p>movies with</p>
<p>metal ships and shit like that</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s more of a</p>
<p>dimensional</p>
<p>thing I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>know if you talk to people that know anything</p>
<p>about quantum physics and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand it I don&rsquo;t get it but</p>
<p>from their claims and</p>
<p>supposedly this is mathematically provable there&rsquo;s at</p>
<p>least 11 dimensions</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s just what we know</p>
<p>about what does that even</p>
<p>mean do you even know what that means I&rsquo;m not sure I do</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>I think that</p>
<p>the way I think about it</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s very likely that just this reality</p>
<p>is just the reality that we&rsquo;re tuned into</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>an infinite number of different realities</p>
<p>going on at the same time all around us</p>
<p>we just can&rsquo;t tune into it we just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>literally don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>senses for it</p>
<p>so it might be that</p>
<p>alien life is here</p>
<p>right now all the time it&rsquo;s just operating</p>
<p>on like a different</p>
<p>frequency on the dial</p>
<p>you know like that the</p>
<p>world is a radio and that we&rsquo;re 971 but that the</p>
<p>aliens are 1098 and you know we just can&rsquo;t tune them in</p>
<p>you know who</p>
<p>the fuck knows</p>
<p>but you know when you</p>
<p>start talking aliens</p>
<p>people gonna</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re crazy</p>
<p>if we ever did man if we ever did fucking find</p>
<p>aliens god damn would that be a crazy day</p>
<p>if they ever did come down but I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they would be too nice to us</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not so nice to chimps</p>
<p>you know look at what we do to killer whales man</p>
<p>you know we take fucking killer whales we</p>
<p>just we know they&rsquo;re super smart and we don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>get in the fish tank stupid</p>
<p>get in the tank and do tricks</p>
<p>you know what makes us think that</p>
<p>aliens are gonna treat us any differently</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>all these alien abduction experiments are all</p>
<p>about maybe</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t take it seriously at all they just</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re crazy pink monkeys with nuclear weapons</p>
<p>and they come down and they fuck with us</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a joke that I do in my act</p>
<p>about how if there are really are aliens</p>
<p>I believe that Earth is the Tijuana of outer space</p>
<p>and I really I think that might be accurate</p>
<p>this might be just a place to come to fuck around</p>
<p>you know why</p>
<p>would you want to fix us so what so we can make more</p>
<p>is already 6 billion of us</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>why would you want to make more</p>
<p>in you know</p>
<p>the last hundred years I mean how many more</p>
<p>people have been born some like 4 or 5 fucking billion</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s getting pretty nutty man</p>
<p>this is motherfuckers</p>
<p>gonna get overcrowded soon and</p>
<p>why would they mean if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna fix us it would have to be a radical changing</p>
<p>it would have to be really radical because</p>
<p>socially we are not catching up to where we are</p>
<p>technologically</p>
<p>our awareness is not up to what we&rsquo;re capable of</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re capable of blowing up the whole planet</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re capable of creating</p>
<p>black holes and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re capable</p>
<p>of all kinds of nutty shit I mean just the</p>
<p>the nuclear arsenal that</p>
<p>North Korea possesses</p>
<p>look at those dummies</p>
<p>they got one fucking</p>
<p>stupid little dude with glasses</p>
<p>makes them shut the</p>
<p>lights out at</p>
<p>night to save energy nobody&rsquo;s got any money this</p>
<p>motherfuckers got a gang nuclear weapons just wanted</p>
<p>to launch on people</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>oh look at this guy 11 dimensions explained says</p>
<p>S Y Z G Y One one one one</p>
<p>I watch that and I still won&rsquo;t learn anymore</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll watch it but I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>still be like I&rsquo;m not sure really what they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>okay couple</p>
<p>more questions and I get the fuck out of here I hear my</p>
<p>little daughter crying</p>
<p>if aliens didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist that says</p>
<p>that everyone who was abducted or saw UFO is</p>
<p>crazy no it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t because</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>what UFO means is unidentified</p>
<p>let me tell you something man</p>
<p>people are full of shit</p>
<p>you know we did a</p>
<p>thing I used to</p>
<p>do a show called Game Show in my head I did it for CBS</p>
<p>and it was a hidden camera game show</p>
<p>and what the show was</p>
<p>was we would</p>
<p>have a contestant and the contestant</p>
<p>would have to convince people to do a</p>
<p>bunch of shit</p>
<p>and it would be</p>
<p>under a hidden camera</p>
<p>and we set up in Hollywood</p>
<p>and this dude we had a contestant</p>
<p>dress up like</p>
<p>a newscaster like a guy who worked for Channel 4 News</p>
<p>and he stood there in the</p>
<p>street corner</p>
<p>and we had all</p>
<p>these cameras</p>
<p>pointed on them and</p>
<p>the cameras</p>
<p>right on the people</p>
<p>and he would go up to people and say can you do me a</p>
<p>favor I&rsquo;m in a terrible situation</p>
<p>we had a situation here</p>
<p>earlier and</p>
<p>a UFO landed they had to tell</p>
<p>the people on camera</p>
<p>that a UFO landed</p>
<p>and that all</p>
<p>these witnesses</p>
<p>had seen it</p>
<p>but then the witnesses took off</p>
<p>so I need you to pretend that you saw it</p>
<p>and every fucking person we</p>
<p>asked to do that did it</p>
<p>I thought no one was</p>
<p>gonna do it they just stepped</p>
<p>right up and they so tell us</p>
<p>about the experience</p>
<p>the guy was</p>
<p>like well you know I saw the UFO and it cram</p>
<p>was silver and</p>
<p>lights around the edge</p>
<p>they describe it in detail</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sitting there like what</p>
<p>people love</p>
<p>to be on camera</p>
<p>and people are just</p>
<p>generally full</p>
<p>of shit and even if they did see something</p>
<p>by the time that</p>
<p>story comes around and there&rsquo;s cameras on them</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re being interviewed</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re talking to reporters</p>
<p>that story is</p>
<p>gonna morph in</p>
<p>their memory it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna change</p>
<p>who knows what the fuck it was</p>
<p>it could have been an</p>
<p>experimental government jet</p>
<p>it could have been a flock of birds at</p>
<p>night it could have been a UFO</p>
<p>who the fuck knows</p>
<p>who knows what it really was but</p>
<p>the people that are talking</p>
<p>about are almost all nuts man</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re almost all loony</p>
<p>so I think that people see</p>
<p>things and then they</p>
<p>blow those things up in their head</p>
<p>and as far as the abduction</p>
<p>experiences</p>
<p>all UFO abduction</p>
<p>experiences</p>
<p>occur while people are sleeping</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>occurring late at</p>
<p>night if you look at them the bulk of them</p>
<p>except that people are just probably</p>
<p>completely insane to think they</p>
<p>come and take them</p>
<p>during the middle of the day and</p>
<p>bring them back</p>
<p>and it seems like they&rsquo;re only gone for a</p>
<p>second but really they&rsquo;re gone for days</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>loons that will tell you some stories like that but</p>
<p>I think that what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s DMT related</p>
<p>because we know that the</p>
<p>brain produces DMT</p>
<p>while a person is in</p>
<p>heavy REM sleep</p>
<p>and if you smoke BMT</p>
<p>the experience that you have is very much alien</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very much like what you would</p>
<p>expect someone to be talking</p>
<p>about if they were brought to another</p>
<p>world or brought aboard a spaceship</p>
<p>I mean it feels like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going on to something</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>who knows what kind of</p>
<p>you know a response</p>
<p>you would give</p>
<p>these UFO people if you took them</p>
<p>and gave them DMT</p>
<p>and made them</p>
<p>smoke DMT and go okay</p>
<p>was that what you saw</p>
<p>if they were like</p>
<p>yeah I was back on the ship you go okay settle down</p>
<p>then you know then you know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on you</p>
<p>know what what is that there are they really</p>
<p>making contact with entities</p>
<p>is it really</p>
<p>their brain and their</p>
<p>their imagination</p>
<p>that becomes</p>
<p>supercharged because of the</p>
<p>chemical that</p>
<p>floods through</p>
<p>it and what is imagination exactly I mean</p>
<p>people can poo</p>
<p>poo that and say oh it&rsquo;s just you&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>things up it&rsquo;s hallucinations</p>
<p>is it you know</p>
<p>how do you know that that</p>
<p>world is not just as real as this</p>
<p>world just because this</p>
<p>world you can bang on it</p>
<p>make noise you know you can feel it that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s more real</p>
<p>that just means it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>solid you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very possible that the</p>
<p>world of the imagination the</p>
<p>world of your mind the</p>
<p>world of dreams</p>
<p>is really a</p>
<p>world is really another dimension</p>
<p>do I believe in</p>
<p>ghosts I&rsquo;m not scared of them</p>
<p>I fucking watch</p>
<p>those ghost stories</p>
<p>like what are they scared of this fucking</p>
<p>ghost never kill anybody</p>
<p>you see I saw some shit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing how many of</p>
<p>those goddamn</p>
<p>shows there are though everybody wants to like</p>
<p>watch the paranoia more</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s obsessed with Ufos and</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s obsessed with you know</p>
<p>shit that&rsquo;s not necessarily real</p>
<p>you know Bigfoot like I&rsquo;ve always said the killer</p>
<p>whales are way more interesting than Bigfoot</p>
<p>these super intelligent animals that</p>
<p>actually rescue people</p>
<p>they kill great white sharks</p>
<p>they kill dolphins they&rsquo;re like they&rsquo;re ruthless</p>
<p>crazy super intelligent animals</p>
<p>they play with their dead</p>
<p>like seals you ever see killer whales</p>
<p>like throw a seal up in the air and</p>
<p>SWAT them with their tail and send them flying</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fucking ruthless and they&rsquo;re super smart</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating shit</p>
<p>all right I think</p>
<p>chat roulette</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>on chat roulette you probably seen my deck sorry no I</p>
<p>never put my dick on chat roulette that&rsquo;s just rude son</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s funny though</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done it yet</p>
<p>I did the other roulette</p>
<p>where you just type just like a it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>one on one personal messaging</p>
<p>like and there&rsquo;s always dudes trying to get laid</p>
<p>are you a dude and I would say yes</p>
<p>and then they would just fucking hang up on me so I</p>
<p>started saying I was a chick</p>
<p>and I did a few of those and I put them up on</p>
<p>the forums on Joe Rogan net it was kind of fun</p>
<p>all right did Dan Hardy</p>
<p>get to leap prog</p>
<p>top 10 welterweights</p>
<p>and get a title shot you know</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s hard to say</p>
<p>I think Dan hardy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exciting dude</p>
<p>he talks a lot of shit he&rsquo;s saying all the</p>
<p>right things</p>
<p>he got serious</p>
<p>power in his hands</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just whether or not he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be able to deal with that fucking</p>
<p>wrestling game of GSPS</p>
<p>GSP can take</p>
<p>you down man he&rsquo;s such an athlete man he&rsquo;s so explosive</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s just really hard for dudes to</p>
<p>avoid that takedown</p>
<p>and he gets on top of you and stays on top he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna beat your ass</p>
<p>you know the thing is</p>
<p>about GSP is</p>
<p>will it be a</p>
<p>fight like the</p>
<p>Tiago Alves</p>
<p>fight where he</p>
<p>neutralize Alves</p>
<p>but he never really came</p>
<p>close to stopping him</p>
<p>or will it be a</p>
<p>fight like the Fitch</p>
<p>fighter the BJ</p>
<p>fight where he just gets on top of him</p>
<p>beats the fucking shit out of him</p>
<p>or will Hardy have something up his</p>
<p>sleeve you know</p>
<p>maybe hardy&rsquo;s take</p>
<p>down defenses better than we thought it is you know</p>
<p>maybe Hardy</p>
<p>has a strategy for</p>
<p>how to counter the double</p>
<p>and how to stop him when he&rsquo;s coming in</p>
<p>or how to you</p>
<p>know take it to him or maybe he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna pull guard</p>
<p>who the fuck knows what hardy&rsquo;s gonna do</p>
<p>hardy&rsquo;s a very very</p>
<p>smart guy and he&rsquo;s very confident it&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>confidence it&rsquo;s not bullshit</p>
<p>he really believes that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna clip GSP and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna rock them and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna go home with the title</p>
<p>who the fuck knows son</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>spice bag of ice a</p>
<p>spilled bag of ice</p>
<p>says that the 11th dimension is in his</p>
<p>pants wow that</p>
<p>spilled bag of ice is</p>
<p>still around I thought you</p>
<p>would have abandoned that Twitter by now</p>
<p>you got a lot of stick to</p>
<p>it if not son</p>
<p>good for you</p>
<p>all right I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s enough</p>
<p>right sucking</p>
<p>37 11 that&rsquo;s a perfect time to end</p>
<p>we are proof that</p>
<p>aliens exist</p>
<p>perspective</p>
<p>okay I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;ve done too much drugs</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re ruining the</p>
<p>whole cause dot com</p>
<p>I will look one more time for</p>
<p>a good question on the forums Joe open</p>
<p>net and if we cannot find one we&rsquo;ll wrap it up bitches</p>
<p>did anyone ever wonder why</p>
<p>we lose all the good rappers that have a significant</p>
<p>place in hip hop history rappers like</p>
<p>Tupac Big E</p>
<p>Big L Eazy E</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know Big L is</p>
<p>easy E Yeah yet we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stuck with garbage like Nelly and fucking Soldier Boy</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>I think rappers man that life</p>
<p>you know the life is all guns and</p>
<p>I mean when you&rsquo;re Tupac</p>
<p>and you got fucking machine guns</p>
<p>tattooed on your body it says thug life on your stomach</p>
<p>you know those aren&rsquo;t signs of</p>
<p>a long and healthy career</p>
<p>he was like the</p>
<p>first dude to like</p>
<p>cover his body his</p>
<p>whole body with</p>
<p>tattoos too</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all doing that now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really crazy</p>
<p>you know Little Wayne</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s hilarious that Little Wayne</p>
<p>said that he&rsquo;s a gangster like told</p>
<p>Katie Kirk I&rsquo;m a gangster Miss Katie</p>
<p>meanwhile they</p>
<p>put him in jail they immediately put him in</p>
<p>protective custody</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a gangster</p>
<p>maybe you and you get all your</p>
<p>money and you&rsquo;re outside but the inside world no</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a singer</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re an entertainer and it</p>
<p>would be awesome if one of</p>
<p>those guys fucked your face not</p>
<p>for everybody for them for that guy to fuck your face</p>
