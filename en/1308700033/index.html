    <p>Our card this week is Marjorie Fithian, a wild card from Colorado.</p>
<p>It broke my heart when I first heard about what happened to Marjorie and her son,</p>
<p>so even though they&rsquo;re not featured on a cold case card in Colorado,</p>
<p>I knew we had to tell you their story.</p>
<p>And not just because it is so devastating,</p>
<p>but because nearly 50 years have gone by since Marjorie&rsquo;s murder,</p>
<p>and some of the stories surrounding her death are as confusing today as they were back then.</p>
<p>From a personal attack to a serial killer to drug conspiracies,</p>
<p>detectives need help closing this case.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s haunted them for decades, and they&rsquo;re still desperate to solve it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>Around 9 a.m. on June 24th, 1975, Terry Furnish, a ranch worker,</p>
<p>was driving down a rural dirt road in Roggin, Colorado, toward work.</p>
<p>Terry was a few miles away from the ranch when he saw a car speeding by him,</p>
<p>heading in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Now, it might not sound unusual to pass another car on your way to work,</p>
<p>but on this particular country road, it was.</p>
<p>Terry was on County Road 386, which is a dirt road sandwiched between two highways</p>
<p>with nothing but fields as far as you can see.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really a thoroughfare, so it was weird to see a little sedan way out there.</p>
<p>The car was going fast, and it kicked up dirt as it sped past Terry&rsquo;s truck.</p>
<p>Terry thought maybe it was just someone who took the wrong exit off nearby I-76,</p>
<p>but further down, he spotted something on the side of the road.</p>
<p>When Terry pulled over and got out, panic rushed over him.</p>
<p>It was a woman lying on the side of the road, covered in blood.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s former detective Jack Van Arsdall.</p>
<p>Back then, he was the only detective at the sheriff&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>He came across and he saw her face and described this blood gushing out of her face.</p>
<p>Jack is in his 70s now and has long been retired from law enforcement,</p>
<p>but despite it being almost 47 years later, Jack remembers that day well.</p>
<p>He remembers Terry saying that he was shocked at the sight of the bleeding woman,</p>
<p>but even more shocking was what the ranch worker saw next to her.</p>
<p>A toddler.</p>
<p>A little blonde boy who appeared to be no older than one or two</p>
<p>was sitting next to the woman, holding her hand.</p>
<p>In those first few moments, Terry had a hard time comprehending what he was looking at.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t tell if the woman was even still alive.</p>
<p>She was wearing jeans, a blouse, and one of her sandals was off to the side.</p>
<p>She had reddish hair that was cut in a signature 70s shag.</p>
<p>Her feathered bangs were covered in blood from what looked like a gunshot wound to her forehead.</p>
<p>His adrenaline pumping, Terry ran back to his truck and got on his CB radio and called out for help.</p>
<p>His shaking voice went out over the airwaves and ranchers nearby heard him</p>
<p>say that there had been a shooting.</p>
<p>So they all dropped what they were doing and headed to where Terry said he was,</p>
<p>about four miles up the dirt road from I-76.</p>
<p>His radio call out also reached Colorado state troopers</p>
<p>and Weld County patrol deputies in nearby Greeley.</p>
<p>Jack said one of the state troopers got to the scene first</p>
<p>and he called for an ambulance because the woman still had a pulse</p>
<p>and a deputy, unsure what else to do,</p>
<p>picked up the boy and put him in the back of his patrol car.</p>
<p>Medics got there pretty fast, loaded the woman into the ambulance</p>
<p>and rushed her toward the hospital.</p>
<p>Jack remembers passing the ambulance on the way to the scene</p>
<p>and he stopped the medics to ask if he could hop in</p>
<p>in case the woman became alert and said anything.</p>
<p>But the EMTs told him that she had just died.</p>
<p>When she passed away in the ambulance, instead of going to the hospital,</p>
<p>the medics took her to the local mortuary in Greeley,</p>
<p>which was owned and operated by the Weld County coroner at the time.</p>
<p>We proceeded on down to this crime scene.</p>
<p>Pretty confusing mess.</p>
<p>A couple of state patrol cars, a couple of farmers,</p>
<p>a couple of ranchers, a couple of our guys.</p>
<p>So it was a lot of stuff going on right there on a little dirt road.</p>
<p>It was only 9.30 a.m.</p>
<p>Deputies wondered who the woman was</p>
<p>and why she&rsquo;d been way out there in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Weld County Sheriff Steven Reams.</p>
<p>Where this crime occurred is not easily accessible off the highway.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t just take an exit ramp and turn.</p>
<p>You have to kind of go out of your way to get where they ended up at.</p>
<p>Even though there&rsquo;s very little traffic here,</p>
<p>deputies shut down the road and secured the scene.</p>
<p>The first thing Jack noticed was shattered glass on the side of the road.</p>
<p>There was also a lot of blood and one of the victim&rsquo;s shoes,</p>
<p>a brown leather sandal.</p>
<p>There was a jacket and a blanket on the ground,</p>
<p>both of which the first responders put on the woman when they arrived.</p>
<p>And most notably, there was no weapon anywhere to be found.</p>
<p>Jack asked Terry, the ranch hand,</p>
<p>if the woman had said anything when he first found her.</p>
<p>But he said that she was unconscious.</p>
<p>I mean, he thought that she was dead until law enforcement showed up</p>
<p>and took her pulse.</p>
<p>Terry told Jack about the car that he&rsquo;d seen heading away from the scene</p>
<p>right before he spotted the victim.</p>
<p>He said he had no way of knowing if it was involved,</p>
<p>but he felt like it was a weird coincidence.</p>
<p>He described it as a yellowish brown sedan</p>
<p>with a black cloth top that was ripped in one spot.</p>
<p>Jack radioed back to dispatch and gave them the car description</p>
<p>so they could put out a bulletin for people to be on the lookout.</p>
<p>Our team also interviewed Detective Byron Castellon.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the Weld County Sheriff&rsquo;s investigator working the case today.</p>
<p>He said Terry unfortunately didn&rsquo;t get a good look at the driver</p>
<p>or even the license plate.</p>
<p>And because it had blown by him so fast,</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t certain where exactly he&rsquo;d pass the car on the dirt road.</p>
<p>County Road 386 is a pretty long road,</p>
<p>so I couldn&rsquo;t really determine at what point he might have seen that vehicle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s possible that it wasn&rsquo;t involved,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s certainly possible that it was.</p>
<p>When Jack turned his attention back to the scene,</p>
<p>he knew he needed to work fast because if the woman was shot</p>
<p>and she was still alive around 9 a.m.,</p>
<p>he knew her killer had to have struck shortly before that time,</p>
<p>which meant they had to still be in the area.</p>
<p>One of the ranch workers had seen tire marks nearby,</p>
<p>which he pointed out to police.</p>
<p>Deputies thought they looked fresh</p>
<p>and were really close to where the woman was laying,</p>
<p>so investigators took photos of them.</p>
<p>We were actually able to get copies of those</p>
<p>and other crime scene photos,</p>
<p>which you can see on thedeckpodcast.com.</p>
<p>Those photos will also help you get a sense of just how rural this area is,</p>
<p>and our team said that it looks exactly the same today.</p>
<p>It still is a dirt road and everything.</p>
<p>As Jack and the other deputies sifted through the broken glass and dirt,</p>
<p>they found a spent bullet casing.</p>
<p>Deputies could tell that it had come from a .25 caliber round</p>
<p>and likely an automatic pistol.</p>
<p>They photographed the casing and bagged it up.</p>
<p>As they searched for more evidence,</p>
<p>Jack and other deputies at the scene grappled with what to do</p>
<p>with the little boy who was still sitting in the deputy&rsquo;s patrol car.</p>
<p>The boy being with his mom when she was murdered</p>
<p>is something the members of the sheriff&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>have never been able to shake.</p>
<p>Here Sheriff Reams again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked some ugly cases,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve never worked something where a human life was disposed of</p>
<p>on the side of the road and then their child was disposed of,</p>
<p>and almost the same method.</p>
<p>Only by the grace of God is the kid still alive or was his life spared?</p>
<p>Jack and the others decided they should take the boy to the sheriff&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>and try to figure out who he was and who his mom was.</p>
<p>And honestly, at that point,</p>
<p>they knew so little that they were just assuming that the woman was his mother.</p>
<p>But even who she was was a mystery</p>
<p>because she didn&rsquo;t have a wallet or ID on her.</p>
<p>Just then, deputies found something else about 20 yards down the road.</p>
<p>And that would be the key to not only finding out who the woman was,</p>
<p>but what she&rsquo;d been up to before she was shot</p>
<p>and left for dead in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>There was a suitcase not even a hundred feet down the road</p>
<p>from where the woman was shot.</p>
<p>The luggage was sitting just off the road</p>
<p>as if someone had carefully placed it there.</p>
<p>Deputies opened it and found women&rsquo;s clothing</p>
<p>and a few items they figured were the little boy&rsquo;s clothes.</p>
<p>Under the clothing, they came across a small piece of paper</p>
<p>with a phone number on it.</p>
<p>Deputies took the suitcase and the boy</p>
<p>back to the Weld County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office in Greeley,</p>
<p>about 45 minutes west of the crime scene.</p>
<p>That phone number led us to her mom.</p>
<p>The woman who answered the call from the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>was Betty Fithian.</p>
<p>Deputies asked if she knew a young woman with red hair</p>
<p>who had a toddler son.</p>
<p>And Betty said yes.</p>
<p>Her daughter Marjorie Fithian had red hair</p>
<p>and Marjorie&rsquo;s son Sage was 18 months old.</p>
<p>Deputies asked Betty to come to the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office right away.</p>
<p>When she arrived and learned about what happened,</p>
<p>she was devastated and had no idea</p>
<p>who would want to hurt her daughter.</p>
<p>While Betty was collecting Sage and his things,</p>
<p>the county coroner was still examining</p>
<p>Marjorie&rsquo;s body at the morgue.</p>
<p>But investigators didn&rsquo;t want to waste any time</p>
<p>waiting on the coroner&rsquo;s official findings</p>
<p>to start a homicide investigation.</p>
<p>They wanted to know right away if Marjorie had any enemies</p>
<p>or why she&rsquo;d been all the way out near Roggen with her son.</p>
<p>They immediately brought in Terry, the rancher,</p>
<p>for a sit-down interview</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;d have a written statement from him.</p>
<p>They wanted to make sure he hadn&rsquo;t forgotten any details,</p>
<p>maybe, about the car or the scene.</p>
<p>Terry still couldn&rsquo;t recall any details about the driver.</p>
<p>And again, he just said the most significant thing</p>
<p>about the car was that cloth top that was ripped on one side.</p>
<p>He was certain of that.</p>
<p>Detective Castellan said deputies at the time</p>
<p>used every tool they had to try and track down cars</p>
<p>that fit that profile.</p>
<p>They did a lot of work on finding vehicles like that</p>
<p>through Colorado Department of DMV.</p>
<p>They got long lists of license plates</p>
<p>for vehicles that matched that description</p>
<p>and looked into where these vehicles were registered to</p>
<p>and who they were registered to.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it didn&rsquo;t come up with any leads,</p>
<p>but not for lack of trying.</p>
<p>That same day, before Betty left with Sage,</p>
<p>they sat down with her to try and figure out</p>
<p>who her daughter had been with that morning</p>
<p>or even the day before.</p>
<p>Though Marjorie didn&rsquo;t live with Betty,</p>
<p>she actually rented a house in Greeley,</p>
<p>Betty knew Marjorie had gone down to Denver</p>
<p>for the weekend to visit her aunt and uncle.</p>
<p>And she was supposed to return to Greeley that morning</p>
<p>because she had classes at the community college</p>
<p>the next day.</p>
<p>So the trip to Denver explained the suitcase,</p>
<p>but it also puzzled investigators</p>
<p>because Roggin is not exactly in between Denver and Greeley.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much further east.</p>
<p>Like detectives, Betty had no idea why her daughter</p>
<p>would have been all the way out in the country</p>
<p>where she was found.</p>
<p>Deputies connected with detectives</p>
<p>at the Denver Police Department</p>
<p>and asked them to go interview Marjorie&rsquo;s uncle right away.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s where things get interesting.</p>
<p>Marjorie&rsquo;s uncle said he dropped off Marjorie</p>
<p>and her son Sage at the bus depot</p>
<p>in downtown Denver around 7 a.m. that morning,</p>
<p>as in just a few hours before.</p>
<p>He said Marjorie and Sage were gonna catch the 7.30 bus</p>
<p>from Denver back to Greeley.</p>
<p>Given the fact that Marjorie and Sage</p>
<p>were in downtown Denver at 7 a.m.</p>
<p>and apparently alive and fine,</p>
<p>it was perplexing how she could have ended up murdered</p>
<p>just two hours later in Roggin, Colorado.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not just saying that it&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>because it wasn&rsquo;t her original intended destination.</p>
<p>Roggin isn&rsquo;t even on that bus line</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a full hour drive away.</p>
<p>So that left a very small window of time</p>
<p>for the murder to take place.</p>
<p>The detectives pressed her uncle for more.</p>
<p>What did she do that weekend?</p>
<p>How did she seem?</p>
<p>Was there anyone else that she might&rsquo;ve met up with?</p>
<p>And he said they had a nice visit with Marjorie that weekend</p>
<p>and that everything seemed fine</p>
<p>when he dropped them off at the bus stop.</p>
<p>For all he knew, Marjorie and Sage</p>
<p>were back in Greeley already.</p>
<p>But Marjorie&rsquo;s uncle did mention someone else</p>
<p>that Marjorie saw that weekend.</p>
<p>He said while she was in Denver,</p>
<p>his niece had gone on a date with a man</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;d been casually seeing.</p>
<p>The man had taken Marjorie and Sage to the zoo</p>
<p>and he said it seemed as if they all had a really nice time.</p>
<p>So the Denver detectives knew their next move</p>
<p>was to find the guy Marjorie was seeing</p>
<p>and then go to the bus depot to find out</p>
<p>if Marjorie and Sage ever actually made it</p>
<p>onto that 7.30 bus back to Greeley.</p>
<p>But if any efforts were actually made back then</p>
<p>to find the guy that she went on a date with,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no documentation of it in today&rsquo;s case file.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of all I have.</p>
<p>If you feel like me moving on in the story right now</p>
<p>leaves a huge gap, same.</p>
<p>But I actually will come back to this later.</p>
<p>While detectives were trying to track down people</p>
<p>at the bus depot, deputies in Greeley</p>
<p>tried to learn more about Marjorie&rsquo;s life there.</p>
<p>Several people said that, you know,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a free spirit, hippie chick,</p>
<p>very trusting, maybe to a fault, was a good mother.</p>
<p>You know, everybody seemed to like her.</p>
<p>Everybody I talked to couldn&rsquo;t imagine anybody</p>
<p>that would want to kill her</p>
<p>because of anything that she did,</p>
<p>any argument that she had</p>
<p>or any problems that she had with anybody.</p>
<p>They found out that Sage&rsquo;s dad wasn&rsquo;t in the picture,</p>
<p>but he lived out of state</p>
<p>and was in fact out of state on June 24th.</p>
<p>So this wasn&rsquo;t over any kind of custody dispute.</p>
<p>Betty didn&rsquo;t know who killed her daughter or why.</p>
<p>So she had no way of knowing if Sage was still in danger.</p>
<p>Moreover, as she had to transition</p>
<p>from grandmother to mother figure,</p>
<p>she worried about Sage.</p>
<p>She had no idea what her grandson had witnessed</p>
<p>or if he understood anything that had happened.</p>
<p>She wanted to protect him as much as possible.</p>
<p>In Weld County the next day, June 25th,</p>
<p>Detective Jack Van Arsdale and the sheriff at the time</p>
<p>went back out to the crime scene on horseback.</p>
<p>They rode up and down the road looking for more evidence,</p>
<p>specifically looking for the murder weapon,</p>
<p>thinking maybe it had been discarded</p>
<p>somewhere near where they found her suitcase.</p>
<p>But all they found was more broken glass.</p>
<p>That day they also searched Marjorie&rsquo;s house in Greeley,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t find many clues there either.</p>
<p>The next day Marjorie&rsquo;s death hit the local newspaper,</p>
<p>the Greeley Daily Tribune.</p>
<p>They announced funeral plans and a memorial fund</p>
<p>that had been set up for Sage.</p>
<p>The news of her death triggered a lot of people</p>
<p>to call the Weld County Sheriff&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>A few tipsters said that they thought Marjorie</p>
<p>had been involved in drug trade,</p>
<p>maybe as a mule moving drugs from Denver up to Greeley,</p>
<p>but that didn&rsquo;t totally jibe for police.</p>
<p>When they searched her home,</p>
<p>they found very small amounts of marijuana residue,</p>
<p>but nothing to suggest drug trafficking</p>
<p>or any evidence of a high-risk lifestyle for that matter.</p>
<p>But Jack decided they should follow any lead that came in.</p>
<p>By then detectives in Denver told deputies in Weld County</p>
<p>that they found the bus driver</p>
<p>who would have driven the 7.30 a.m. route</p>
<p>on June 24th from Denver to Greeley.</p>
<p>They said when they showed the driver</p>
<p>a photo of Marjorie and Sage,</p>
<p>the driver was like, nope,</p>
<p>those two never even tried to get on my bus that morning.</p>
<p>Now detectives weren&rsquo;t exactly surprised by this news.</p>
<p>There was no possible scenario for Marjorie</p>
<p>to have ended up dead in Roggen</p>
<p>if she had gotten onto that bus.</p>
<p>The timeline just didn&rsquo;t add up, but they had to be sure.</p>
<p>So that led police to wonder if Marjorie had hitchhiked</p>
<p>rather than taking the bus.</p>
<p>So they went back to Marjorie&rsquo;s uncle</p>
<p>to see if he had maybe seen her get in a car with anyone.</p>
<p>He said no, but he did say</p>
<p>that when he got back to his house that morning,</p>
<p>he found something interesting.</p>
<p>He went back in the room and saw some change on the floor.</p>
<p>And he thought maybe that had fallen out of her pants</p>
<p>when she was getting dressed.</p>
<p>So she may not have had enough money for the bus ticket.</p>
<p>That was his impression.</p>
<p>Maybe if she had accidentally dropped her money,</p>
<p>it forced her to hitchhike.</p>
<p>This was all before the days</p>
<p>of surveillance cameras everywhere.</p>
<p>So police had no way of knowing what happened after that,</p>
<p>unless they could find someone</p>
<p>who actually witnessed Marjorie getting into someone&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>By the end of June,</p>
<p>the Greeley Daily Tribune was running regular articles</p>
<p>about the murder investigation.</p>
<p>On June 30th, a headline read,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Murder Probe Uncovers Little.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the next several weeks,</p>
<p>Jack and five other deputies worked around the clock,</p>
<p>interviewing all of Marjorie&rsquo;s relatives and friends</p>
<p>who were scattered all over Northern Colorado.</p>
<p>They needed to find out what motives</p>
<p>someone would have to kill her.</p>
<p>Some tips were coming in about a group of local men</p>
<p>who all had criminal histories,</p>
<p>mostly for drug-related crimes.</p>
<p>People around town were hearing that four of the men,</p>
<p>guys named Vernon, Robbie, Jerry, and Larry,</p>
<p>were involved in Marjorie&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>Deputies decided to expand their interviews</p>
<p>to see if they could get any information</p>
<p>that would connect these men to Marjorie,</p>
<p>or if they could at least figure out</p>
<p>what the men were up to the weekend she was killed.</p>
<p>But deputies were already familiar with these men</p>
<p>because they had regular run-ins with the law,</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t think that any of these guys drove the car</p>
<p>that the rancher had seen leaving the scene,</p>
<p>though they were still determined to talk to them.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, police found out that two of the men,</p>
<p>Jerry and Robbie, had been arrested in a neighboring town</p>
<p>and were burning down their buddy Vern&rsquo;s garage.</p>
<p>This made deputies even more suspicious</p>
<p>because they knew that these guys were close,</p>
<p>so this obviously meant there&rsquo;d been</p>
<p>some kind of falling out with the group,</p>
<p>and they wondered if it had anything</p>
<p>to do with Marjorie&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>So this is red flag number one.</p>
<p>Red flag number two was that in August,</p>
<p>a tip came in from a man who said that Jerry</p>
<p>was bragging about Marjorie&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>The man even said that Jerry showed him proof</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;d killed her.</p>
<p>Now, this guy, whose name was kept confidential,</p>
<p>told police that Jerry showed him photos of Marjorie</p>
<p>with gunshot wounds to her face.</p>
<p>According to reporting in the Greeley Tribune</p>
<p>from August 1975, the confidential informant said</p>
<p>Jerry showed him one black and white photo</p>
<p>and two colored photos of Marjorie, quote,</p>
<p>suffering from wounds.</p>
<p>Attributing to a court affidavit,</p>
<p>the Tribune also reported that Jerry allegedly told</p>
<p>two other people that he, quote,</p>
<p>shot that in the face.</p>
<p>So police took action.</p>
<p>They arrested Jerry for Marjorie&rsquo;s murder</p>
<p>on August 27th, 1975.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d gone to Jerry&rsquo;s house with a search warrant</p>
<p>to look for a 25 caliber weapon,</p>
<p>ammo, or photos of Marjorie,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t find anything.</p>
<p>Now, the next day, the Tribune ran a photo</p>
<p>of Jerry being arrested,</p>
<p>and then Betty Fithian called</p>
<p>the Weld County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>saying something weird happened.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s called me and said that,</p>
<p>strangest thing, Sage just looked at that picture</p>
<p>and said, oh, there&rsquo;s Jerry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only person who&rsquo;s ever identified</p>
<p>or said anything about me.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Jerry.</p>
<p>It gave Jack chills.</p>
<p>This was the first thing Sage had ever said</p>
<p>related to his mom&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>Of course, he wasn&rsquo;t even two years old</p>
<p>and couldn&rsquo;t really speak in full sentences,</p>
<p>but it made Jack wonder if Sage recognized Jerry</p>
<p>from maybe a relationship with his mom prior to her death,</p>
<p>or maybe if Sage knew him from the day of the murder,</p>
<p>or maybe it was a total fluke.</p>
<p>Like maybe Sage had just heard Jerry&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>on the news or something and was just repeating it</p>
<p>the way two year olds repeat everything they hear.</p>
<p>Until then, Jack had been skeptical</p>
<p>of the stories about Marjorie being involved</p>
<p>with Jerry and the other suspects.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t even totally convinced of the informant&rsquo;s story</p>
<p>about the photos of Marjorie&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>And it was just one of those things</p>
<p>that he was gonna remain skeptical about</p>
<p>until he saw the evidence for himself.</p>
<p>So to build a stronger case,</p>
<p>deputies knew that they needed to get a confession</p>
<p>from the other men.</p>
<p>But before they were able to strengthen their case,</p>
<p>the district attorney filed a motion</p>
<p>to dismiss the first degree murder charge against Jerry.</p>
<p>According to reporting in the Greeley Daily Tribune,</p>
<p>the murder charge was dismissed due to lack of evidence.</p>
<p>Jerry was still facing charges of criminal mischief,</p>
<p>assault and arson for burning down Vern&rsquo;s garage,</p>
<p>but those are all misdemeanors.</p>
<p>So he was released from jail on a $5,000 bond.</p>
<p>Jack and the other investigators didn&rsquo;t give up though.</p>
<p>They heard about a drug party happening on October 1st</p>
<p>that some of the suspects would be attending.</p>
<p>So they got a search warrant,</p>
<p>raided the party and arrested everyone there.</p>
<p>Jack pulled Robbie, one of Jerry&rsquo;s buddies aside,</p>
<p>and he started talking.</p>
<p>He said, well, it was Vern Hudson.</p>
<p>I was in the car with Vern Hudson and Larry Joe Hernandez</p>
<p>when Vern shot her in the face.</p>
<p>At this point, police can&rsquo;t figure out which way is up.</p>
<p>These guys have been pointing fingers</p>
<p>at each other for weeks.</p>
<p>Were they actually involved?</p>
<p>And if so, who actually pulled the trigger?</p>
<p>Was it Vern or Jerry?</p>
<p>Or were they just making up stories</p>
<p>because they all had beef with one another</p>
<p>and were trying to blame each other any chance they got?</p>
<p>Jack said that he never really bought any of their stories</p>
<p>because the only details they could recall</p>
<p>about the murder had been published in the news.</p>
<p>So they were public knowledge.</p>
<p>They still didn&rsquo;t give any information</p>
<p>that only the killers would know.</p>
<p>Plus, Jack kept thinking about the two-hour window</p>
<p>in which Marjorie left Denver,</p>
<p>traveled to Rogin and was shot.</p>
<p>How would a group of men in Greeley</p>
<p>logistically pull that off</p>
<p>unless they were already in Denver?</p>
<p>I keep coming back to 7.30, she got on the bus.</p>
<p>The bus was there and she didn&rsquo;t get on it,</p>
<p>but her uncle dropped her off there at 7.30.</p>
<p>And at 9.30, she&rsquo;s on a dirt road out in Rogin.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think she could have called Jerry Walker</p>
<p>to come pick her up and get her a ride home</p>
<p>or Vern Hudson or&hellip;</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know that they would have been at the bus station.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anybody knew</p>
<p>because she was just coming home from her uncle&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Spending the weekend there.</p>
<p>While Jack was looking for ways to verify</p>
<p>what Robbie had said about Vern</p>
<p>being the one to pull the trigger,</p>
<p>one of their key suspects turned up dead.</p>
<p>While he was out on bail, Jerry died at home.</p>
<p>According to a 1975 news report in the Greeley Daily Tribune,</p>
<p>his wife found him on their living room couch.</p>
<p>It was late morning on Sunday, October 12th.</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s wife called police</p>
<p>and first responders found lots of empty pill bottles</p>
<p>at the scene, which made the coroner rule it a suicide.</p>
<p>But some still consider Jerry&rsquo;s death suspicious.</p>
<p>The Greeley Daily Tribune reported</p>
<p>that his death was ruled an accidental overdose</p>
<p>by the Weld County Coroner&rsquo;s Office.</p>
<p>But some informants told police</p>
<p>that the death wasn&rsquo;t accidental</p>
<p>and it was actually tied to Marjorie&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>A captain with the Greeley Police Department</p>
<p>told the newspaper back then</p>
<p>that letters found in Walker&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>indicated he had contemplated suicide in the past,</p>
<p>but had not discussed it recently.</p>
<p>With Jerry dead, Marjorie&rsquo;s case stalled.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Jack again.</p>
<p>It was kind of a dead end for looking at people.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t getting any more information.</p>
<p>And every time I was told something</p>
<p>or was led to believe something,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d track it back and it was from Robbie Davis</p>
<p>who was talking about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going down that trail again.</p>
<p>Sorry, folks, you know, I just don&rsquo;t believe the guy.</p>
<p>A year went by with little information.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have any evidence</p>
<p>to actually tie Jerry or Vern to the shooting</p>
<p>and the other men kept going back and forth</p>
<p>with their stories.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t stop investigating though.</p>
<p>And in early 1977, they brought Larry,</p>
<p>one of the other men from that main suspect group,</p>
<p>in for a lie detector test.</p>
<p>But Larry passed the polygraph.</p>
<p>He told police that he had sold Marjorie marijuana</p>
<p>a few times and they went to the community college together,</p>
<p>but he did not kill her.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t know who killed her.</p>
<p>With that, police tracked down Vern again.</p>
<p>At that time, he was in jail in Wyoming</p>
<p>facing drug trafficking charges.</p>
<p>He agreed to talk to the Weld County deputies</p>
<p>and denied having anything to do with Marjorie&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>Police even gave Vern an opportunity</p>
<p>to turn on one of the other guys,</p>
<p>but he said the whole thing had been a lie.</p>
<p>And Vern was pretty much cleared.</p>
<p>Certainly didn&rsquo;t have a motive for killing her.</p>
<p>This is when detectives paused and wondered</p>
<p>whether or not they just spent the last year and a half</p>
<p>on a wild goose chase,</p>
<p>working a lead that was completely made up.</p>
<p>So they started to consider other theories,</p>
<p>like a random murder of opportunity.</p>
<p>Maybe Marjorie&rsquo;s killer was a stranger</p>
<p>was a stranger to her.</p>
<p>I think somebody picked her up at the&hellip;</p>
<p>Her dad said that she was pretty friendly gal.</p>
<p>I think somebody realized at the bus station</p>
<p>that she didn&rsquo;t have any money and offered her a ride.</p>
<p>And he said, if that&rsquo;s the scenario,</p>
<p>she would have taken the ride.</p>
<p>The thing about that theory is that it lacks motive.</p>
<p>According to former and current investigators</p>
<p>who have seen the autopsy report,</p>
<p>the coroner back then seemed pretty certain</p>
<p>that she wasn&rsquo;t sexually assaulted.</p>
<p>Now there is the possibility</p>
<p>that whoever Marjorie took a ride with</p>
<p>tried to make a move on her and she refused,</p>
<p>which led to them killing her.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;ve never been able to rule that out</p>
<p>as a possibility.</p>
<p>And they also said that robbery</p>
<p>seemed like an unlikely motive</p>
<p>because Marjorie didn&rsquo;t have a ton of money</p>
<p>and wasn&rsquo;t known to carry cash</p>
<p>or have cash just kind of like laying around.</p>
<p>But Sheriff Reams said two gunshots to the face,</p>
<p>basically execution style, doesn&rsquo;t sound random to him.</p>
<p>To me, it always seemed like it was a very personal thing</p>
<p>to, I guess, circumstances surrounding Marjorie&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Someone knew that she was gonna be traveling with her kid.</p>
<p>Now, could they have just picked that up at a bus stop?</p>
<p>Yes, but to kill her and leave her son behind,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like there was a personal relationship</p>
<p>that was formed there, the anger involved.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what comes across to me, but we just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Obviously, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily take</p>
<p>that many gunshots to kill someone.</p>
<p>Typically, we would call that an overkill.</p>
<p>It would be referred to as an overkill.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessary.</p>
<p>And again, just taking her out in a remote location,</p>
<p>she trusted whoever enough to at least travel with them.</p>
<p>Think about it from Marjorie&rsquo;s perspective for a moment.</p>
<p>Maybe she realized at the bus depot</p>
<p>that she didn&rsquo;t have the money for a ticket,</p>
<p>so she thumbed a ride with a stranger.</p>
<p>If she got in and told the driver to take her to Greeley,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a point in that drive where she would have known</p>
<p>that the person was driving toward the middle of nowhere</p>
<p>instead of to her hometown.</p>
<p>How did her killer justify driving in the wrong direction?</p>
<p>She was trusting enough of someone</p>
<p>to not even try to get out of the car</p>
<p>at a stop sign or anything like that.</p>
<p>Tells me there was some kind of relationship</p>
<p>that was probably there.</p>
<p>And then, yes, the two shots, you know,</p>
<p>dragging her out of the car,</p>
<p>leaving her on the side of the road,</p>
<p>and then just sitting her kid and driving off.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t speak to me of a stranger killing,</p>
<p>but, you know, I can&rsquo;t rule that out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a chance that Marjorie was unconscious already,</p>
<p>but police believe that she was shot</p>
<p>right where the killer left her</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no other way</p>
<p>to explain the glass on the ground.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Jack again.</p>
<p>I think she was shot inside the car.</p>
<p>He went around, got her out,</p>
<p>and shot her a second time on the ground.</p>
<p>Weeks, months, and years went by</p>
<p>without any new information in Marjorie&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>It was heartbreaking to her family.</p>
<p>Then, in 1982, a serial killer came on police&rsquo;s radar</p>
<p>who was claiming that he was responsible</p>
<p>for some murders in Colorado in the 70s.</p>
<p>Otis Toole was in prison for other murders,</p>
<p>and word got out that he had claimed</p>
<p>some Colorado killings from the 70s.</p>
<p>Otis was known to work with serial killer Henry Lee Lucas,</p>
<p>but he was also known to claim killings</p>
<p>that he didn&rsquo;t actually commit,</p>
<p>according to Detective Castellan.</p>
<p>But it turns out Otis may really have been in Colorado</p>
<p>in the summer of 1975, so they went and interviewed him.</p>
<p>Otis agreed to be interviewed about Marjorie&rsquo;s murder,</p>
<p>but he wasn&rsquo;t exactly helpful.</p>
<p>He said, you know, he couldn&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>The detective was like, well, trying to describe</p>
<p>where the murder happened, north of Denver,</p>
<p>northeast of Denver, and he was just noncommittal.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, I&rsquo;m not sure if I was there.</p>
<p>I might have killed her, basically, he said.</p>
<p>According to the Daily Sentinel in Grand Junction, Colorado,</p>
<p>in a report from 1984,</p>
<p>Toole confessed to a 1974 murder in Colorado Springs,</p>
<p>but he later recanted.</p>
<p>Detective Castellan said it was thought</p>
<p>that since Toole knew that he was gonna die in prison,</p>
<p>he had nothing to lose when it came to claiming murders</p>
<p>that he wasn&rsquo;t involved with.</p>
<p>He claimed to have killed people in Colorado,</p>
<p>but he was so vague in his statements that,</p>
<p>to my knowledge, he wasn&rsquo;t really linked</p>
<p>to anything in Colorado.</p>
<p>He claimed to have been in Colorado,</p>
<p>and he claimed to have killed people in Colorado,</p>
<p>but that wasn&rsquo;t verified yet.</p>
<p>The Otis Toole theory was never totally dismissed,</p>
<p>but he couldn&rsquo;t be linked for sure,</p>
<p>and he died in prison when he was 49.</p>
<p>More years passed without updates,</p>
<p>but in the early 2000s,</p>
<p>investigators took another look at Marjory&rsquo;s case,</p>
<p>and what they found by looking at it</p>
<p>through a modern-day lens</p>
<p>was honestly a little disappointing.</p>
<p>Sheriff Reams was working as a detective back then.</p>
<p>1975 in Weld County,</p>
<p>the resources probably were not as available</p>
<p>to work a case like this.</p>
<p>The manpower that would have been necessary</p>
<p>to track down those leads</p>
<p>and find people in Denver and various other areas,</p>
<p>it just, it seems simple now.</p>
<p>I wish we could go back and try it again,</p>
<p>and every year that goes by,</p>
<p>you realize it&rsquo;s just that much farther</p>
<p>from probably having that likelihood.</p>
<p>So I worry about all that stuff.</p>
<p>To be honest with you,</p>
<p>when I went back and looked for this case file,</p>
<p>I was able to find a certain amount of information</p>
<p>that was stored on site,</p>
<p>and then once I got back from the FBI Academy,</p>
<p>I went out to a place where we store archives,</p>
<p>and I found another box of documents or evidence</p>
<p>related to this case,</p>
<p>some photos and whatnot,</p>
<p>that were in a place</p>
<p>where those items should have never been.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, I worry about what steps were done</p>
<p>and not properly documented or not properly retained.</p>
<p>I hate the idea of potentially saying,</p>
<p>hey, basic steps weren&rsquo;t taken, if they were,</p>
<p>but if they were,</p>
<p>they certainly weren&rsquo;t documented</p>
<p>in a way that we would expect by today&rsquo;s standards.</p>
<p>Jack even admits that if he knew then</p>
<p>what he knows today,</p>
<p>the investigation would have been handled</p>
<p>and documented better.</p>
<p>We just didn&rsquo;t have our act together very well.</p>
<p>We had not gotten our crime scene techs trained yet.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t in place.</p>
<p>So what we had was patrol officers trying to do their job.</p>
<p>Really didn&rsquo;t know what they were doing.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t go back in time</p>
<p>and give themselves the resources</p>
<p>or know how to ace the investigation.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re still working the case today,</p>
<p>hoping for a break.</p>
<p>In order to stay motivated,</p>
<p>they just think about that little boy</p>
<p>on the side of the road,</p>
<p>holding his mom&rsquo;s hand as she died.</p>
<p>Sage is grown today with a family of his own.</p>
<p>He was raised by his aunt and grandma,</p>
<p>and he no longer lives in Colorado,</p>
<p>but he actually agreed to talk to our team</p>
<p>over the phone for this episode.</p>
<p>He was too young to remember his mom,</p>
<p>and he doesn&rsquo;t have any memories from the actual murder.</p>
<p>He only knows what he&rsquo;s heard about his mother,</p>
<p>which was that she was artsy and liked music.</p>
<p>My first name is Dylan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m named after Bob Dylan.</p>
<p>And then Sage after, I think, Sagebrush.</p>
<p>So, you know, definitely of that era and of that time,</p>
<p>I think she was a painter.</p>
<p>She wrote poetry.</p>
<p>So I have old scrapbooks of some of her work,</p>
<p>and we all have pictures or paintings that she had done.</p>
<p>Sage has some of his mom&rsquo;s albums,</p>
<p>and he said while none of his children</p>
<p>got Marjorie&rsquo;s red hair,</p>
<p>he wonders if they got her talent.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s, you know, some of our kids</p>
<p>show some talent in that direction.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s nice to think that we could attribute that to her,</p>
<p>you know?</p>
<p>Sage has heard the stories</p>
<p>about how the ranch hand found him at the murder scene.</p>
<p>He said his family did a good job of protecting him</p>
<p>from a lot of the details when he was growing up.</p>
<p>But I, you know, think about my children at that age</p>
<p>and just how that, yeah, that would be difficult for them.</p>
<p>But luckily, I had a good support system around me.</p>
<p>Sage still doesn&rsquo;t know who killed his mom</p>
<p>or why they spared his life.</p>
<p>He said he&rsquo;s tried not to obsess over the investigation</p>
<p>over his lifetime,</p>
<p>but it would be nice to know who did it,</p>
<p>if only for his grandma, aunt, and other family members</p>
<p>who were distraught over losing Marjorie.</p>
<p>He witnessed that heartbreak firsthand</p>
<p>when he was growing up.</p>
<p>Anytime someone would bring up his mom,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d see his grandma and his aunts</p>
<p>and his uncles just get sad.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can lose a daughter or a sister</p>
<p>or a mother and not be traumatized by it,</p>
<p>and especially when it&rsquo;s the way that it happened.</p>
<p>So, you know, kind of putting those pieces together,</p>
<p>I think, again, this would bring closure for everybody.</p>
<p>In March 2020, Detective Castellan</p>
<p>started working cold cases full-time</p>
<p>for the Weld County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office.</p>
<p>He knew there was a lot of pressure</p>
<p>to get this case solved,</p>
<p>so he absorbed all of the information possible</p>
<p>and got to work re-interviewing everyone</p>
<p>who was still alive today.</p>
<p>In April 2020, he revisited Robbie,</p>
<p>one of the only initial suspects who&rsquo;s still alive today,</p>
<p>and Robbie admitted that he made up the story</p>
<p>about Verne shooting Marjorie</p>
<p>because he was mad at Verne for something at the time.</p>
<p>He said that&rsquo;s why they burned down his garage, too.</p>
<p>In spring of 2020, Detective Castellan</p>
<p>even tracked down the man Marjorie went on a date with</p>
<p>in Denver in 1975,</p>
<p>and they went on that date, remember,</p>
<p>the day before she was murdered.</p>
<p>Now, he said the man was never a suspect,</p>
<p>but he remembered being interviewed by police</p>
<p>back in the day.</p>
<p>But again, there&rsquo;s no documentation of that interview</p>
<p>in Detective Castellan&rsquo;s files today,</p>
<p>but the man did say something to him that makes no sense.</p>
<p>He told Detective Castellan</p>
<p>that he dropped Marjorie and Sage</p>
<p>off at the bus stop on June 25th.</p>
<p>Obviously, that contradicts</p>
<p>what police always thought was the truth,</p>
<p>that Marjorie&rsquo;s uncle dropped her off at the bus depot.</p>
<p>Detective Castellan said Marjorie&rsquo;s uncle is deceased now,</p>
<p>and he was also never a suspect.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s not really a way to reinvestigate</p>
<p>that discrepancy today.</p>
<p>Detective Castellan said he thinks it might just be</p>
<p>a memory mix-up on the part of the boyfriend.</p>
<p>When we asked him about the boyfriend&rsquo;s car,</p>
<p>like did it match the one seen leaving the scene,</p>
<p>he said he didn&rsquo;t know what kind of car he had,</p>
<p>and he doesn&rsquo;t think that police ever searched it</p>
<p>or anything like that.</p>
<p>In fall of 2020, some news stories ran</p>
<p>about Detective Castellan taking on Weld County&rsquo;s cold cases,</p>
<p>which actually prompted the last and most recent phone call</p>
<p>the department has gotten related to Marjorie&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>It was a woman who said that a creepy thing happened to her</p>
<p>back in 1975, right around the same time Marjorie was killed.</p>
<p>She said that she was walking in north of UNC,</p>
<p>like maybe on 13th Ave or 12th Ave, somewhere around there,</p>
<p>back around this time, like in June of 1975,</p>
<p>and there was this guy in a van following her,</p>
<p>like slowly following her, and she&rsquo;s walking down the road,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s looking back, and he&rsquo;s just staring at her,</p>
<p>and he looks super creepy,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s not liking this at all.</p>
<p>So the van finally goes ahead and turns right.</p>
<p>So she keeps walking, and then as she&rsquo;s walking,</p>
<p>she sees the van is parked on that cross street,</p>
<p>like waiting for her.</p>
<p>And so she starts walking up to this house.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s like, maybe he&rsquo;ll think that I live here,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;ll leave me alone.</p>
<p>Well, the van then starts up and comes over</p>
<p>and parks in front of the house.</p>
<p>So she goes into the house,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s freaking out now.</p>
<p>She says, thank God the door was unlocked.</p>
<p>She goes into the house and closes the door,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this old couple in their 60s</p>
<p>sitting in their chairs, reading newspapers,</p>
<p>going, like, what is this lady doing?</p>
<p>She locks the door and hides behind the door,</p>
<p>and the guy comes up and starts banging on the door,</p>
<p>and he tries to open the door.</p>
<p>Thank God she locked it.</p>
<p>So this is a crazy story.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t get a license plate or anything,</p>
<p>but she wanted to give this information.</p>
<p>Detective Castellan said he can&rsquo;t help but wonder</p>
<p>if there was someone targeting young women</p>
<p>in Northern Colorado in June of 1975.</p>
<p>He wishes he had DNA to work with,</p>
<p>but he knows that this is one of those cases</p>
<p>where it truly will take someone</p>
<p>who knows something to speak up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna take either confession</p>
<p>or somebody to get implicated.</p>
<p>Yeah, confession, probably the best thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna get complete closure on it with a conviction.</p>
<p>This case will haunt Marjorie&rsquo;s family</p>
<p>and the Weld County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office until they solve it.</p>
<p>Sheriff Reams says if the right person hears this episode,</p>
<p>it could change a lot of lives, most importantly, Sage&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Only by the grace of God was that kid,</p>
<p>is that kid still alive or was his life spared?</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t imagine what went through someone&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>or how they could sleep from that day forward</p>
<p>knowing what they had done.</p>
<p>And even if we never solve it,</p>
<p>I hope that they burn in hell for the rest of their life</p>
<p>for what they did.</p>
<p>If you know anything that might help this case,</p>
<p>someone who owned a yellowish brown sedan</p>
<p>with a ripped soft top,</p>
<p>someone who even had a different car,</p>
<p>but the window was randomly shot out in June of 1975,</p>
<p>because remember, police think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the shattered glass came from.</p>
<p>Seriously, even the smallest bit of information could help.</p>
<p>You are urged to call the Weld County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>at 970-304-6464.</p>
