    <p>Is anybody else seeing a half a second lag with J-Cal?</p>
<p>Like a second lag?</p>
<p>Test, test, test.</p>
<p>One, two, one, two.</p>
<p>From like the way his mouth moves?</p>
<p>Well, that always happens.</p>
<p>Oh God, here it comes.</p>
<p>His mouth never stops moving.</p>
<p>Relax, Sax.</p>
<p>Relax, Sax.</p>
<p>Are we going?</p>
<p>Are we recording?</p>
<p>Are you ready to go?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t lose this.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t lose this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s A-plus material.</p>
<p>Are we going in hot sacks?</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>This is Chappelle at the punchline.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready to go.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man David Sax.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>And instead, we open sourced it to the fans</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you, S-I-C.</p>
<p>Queen of Quinoa.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>All right, everybody, welcome to episode 111</p>
<p>of the World&rsquo;s Greatest Podcast,</p>
<p>according to Slate,</p>
<p>the podcast that shall not be mentioned</p>
<p>by the press, apparently.</p>
<p>No, what do you mean?</p>
<p>They put a profile on us.</p>
<p>Well, they did.</p>
<p>This is the conundrum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so much of a phenomenon</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re the number one business</p>
<p>and the number one tech podcast in the world, hands down,</p>
<p>that the press has a hard time giving us any oxygen</p>
<p>because they want to hate us.</p>
<p>They want to cover it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying they take the ideas, but not the&hellip;</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to cite it.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to cite it.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to cite it.</p>
<p>But anyway, shout out to Slate.</p>
<p>Yeah, what I thought was interesting</p>
<p>was the guy pointed out that</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want to subject ourselves</p>
<p>to independent journalists asking us independent questions.</p>
<p>Therefore, we go direct.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of the thing nowadays.</p>
<p>When everyone says they want to go direct,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t want to be subject</p>
<p>to independent journalists.</p>
<p>Well, one might ask themselves</p>
<p>why subjects don&rsquo;t want to go direct.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>You mean don&rsquo;t want to go to journalists?</p>
<p>Yeah, because there&rsquo;s a specific reason</p>
<p>why principals, the subject of stories,</p>
<p>do not want to have the press interpret</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t feel they&rsquo;re getting a fair shake.</p>
<p>They feel like the words are being twisted.</p>
<p>Right, but the challenge is that then</p>
<p>we avoid independent scrutiny</p>
<p>of our points of view and our decisions.</p>
<p>No, we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re constantly writing hit pieces about us.</p>
<p>The question is, when we want to present our side of it,</p>
<p>do we need to go through their filter or not?</p>
<p>Why would you go through their filter</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s always going to be a hit piece?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, they have a class hatred</p>
<p>of basically of technology entrepreneurs</p>
<p>and investors.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just your sex.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just your sex.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, Jake, how they don&rsquo;t hate you</p>
<p>because you genuflect to their political biases.</p>
<p>You see, if you do what SPF did,</p>
<p>which is basically agree with all of their biases,</p>
<p>then yes, they&rsquo;ll treat you better.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>And when you say they,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re referring to specific large media outlets,</p>
<p>right, Sax?</p>
<p>They all think the same way.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not referring to Fox or Tucker.</p>
<p>No, but he, there we go.</p>
<p>Okay, you can name one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll trade you Fox for MSNBC and CNN</p>
<p>and the New York Times,</p>
<p>the Washington Post and the Atlantic Magazine</p>
<p>and on and on and on.</p>
<p>You get a lot of mileage out of being able to name Fox.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is-</p>
<p>Megyn Kelly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a podcaster.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s independent now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>You can name one.</p>
<p>I mean, literally one outlet</p>
<p>that is not part of this mainstream media.</p>
<p>And they all think the same way.</p>
<p>There are very small differences in the way they think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about clicks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about clicks at this point.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all about-</p>
<p>Not just about clicks.</p>
<p>And advocacy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that combination.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re calling advocacy is bias and activism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s activism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>Activism journalism, yes.</p>
<p>I think Draymond also highlights a really important point,</p>
<p>which is, you know, he started his podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become one of the most popular forms of sports media.</p>
<p>And he can speak directly without the filtering</p>
<p>and, you know, classification that&rsquo;s done by the,</p>
<p>you know, journalist.</p>
<p>And it seems to be a really powerful trend.</p>
<p>The audience really wants to hear direct</p>
<p>and they want to hear unfiltered, raw points of view.</p>
<p>And maybe there&rsquo;s still a role for,</p>
<p>I think, the journalism separate from that,</p>
<p>which is to then scrutinize and analyze and question and-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not journalism, this is activism.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just activists.</p>
<p>Look, why does anybody-</p>
<p>There are also journalists out there, Sax, right?</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Actually, well, it depends what the topic is</p>
<p>and what the outlet is.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>But actually, I would argue</p>
<p>that most of these journalists are doing</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re doing for the same reason</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re doing what we&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>which is they want to have some kind of influence</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t get paid very much, right?</p>
<p>But the way they have influence</p>
<p>is to push a specific political agenda.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re activists.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re basically party activists.</p>
<p>It has become advocacy journalism.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s the term I coined for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s advocacy journalism.</p>
<p>Did you guys see this brouhaha</p>
<p>where Matt Iglesias wrote this article</p>
<p>about the Fed and about the debt ceiling?</p>
<p>And through this whole multi-hundred word,</p>
<p>thousand word tome,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t understand the difference</p>
<p>between a percentage point and a basis point</p>
<p>and then he didn&rsquo;t calculate the interest directly?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I did see that.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So wait a second.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying the Fed&rsquo;s raising 25%?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a big difference.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a huge difference between a-</p>
<p>My mortgage is going up 25%.</p>
<p>Between a principal and an outside analyst, right?</p>
<p>Like a principal has a better grasp,</p>
<p>typically, of the topics and the material.</p>
<p>But, you know, the argument from a journalist,</p>
<p>the argument from a journalist-</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s considered, he&rsquo;s considered,</p>
<p>within the journalist circle,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s considered the conventional wisdom.</p>
<p>I get it, but the argument from a journalist</p>
<p>is that by having that direct access,</p>
<p>that person is also biased.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re an agent,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re a player on the field,</p>
<p>they do have a point of view</p>
<p>and they do have a direction they want to take things.</p>
<p>So it is a fair commentary</p>
<p>that journalists can theoretically play a role,</p>
<p>which is they&rsquo;re an off-field analyst</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t necessarily bring the bias.</p>
<p>I would argue they&rsquo;re less educated</p>
<p>and more biased than we are.</p>
<p>That may or may not be true,</p>
<p>what the two of you guys are debating,</p>
<p>which is a very subjective take.</p>
<p>But the thing that is categorical,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t deny,</p>
<p>is that there is zero checks and balances</p>
<p>when something as simple as the basis point,</p>
<p>percentage point difference,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t caught in proofreading,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t caught by any editor,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t caught by the people that,</p>
<p>you know, help them review this.</p>
<p>And so what that says is,</p>
<p>all kinds of trash must get through.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s no way for the average person on Twitter</p>
<p>to police all of this nonsensical content.</p>
<p>This one was easy</p>
<p>because it was so numerically illiterate</p>
<p>that it just stood out.</p>
<p>But can you imagine the number of unforced errors</p>
<p>journalists make today in their search for clicks</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t get caught out,</p>
<p>that may actually tip somebody to think A versus B?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I think, the thing that&rsquo;s kind of undeniable.</p>
<p>You only need to,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very simple test for this.</p>
<p>If you read the journalists writing about a topic</p>
<p>you are an expert on,</p>
<p>whatever the topic happens to be,</p>
<p>you start to understand,</p>
<p>okay, well, on that story I&rsquo;m reading,</p>
<p>that they understand about 10 or 20 or 30%</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>But then when you read stories that you&rsquo;re not involved in,</p>
<p>you know, you read a story about Hollywood or,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, pick an industry or a region</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not super aware of,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, okay, well, that must be 100% correct.</p>
<p>And the truth is, journalists have access to five to 20,</p>
<p>there is a name for it, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the Gell-Mann amnesia effect.</p>
<p>You just plagiarized Michael Crichton</p>
<p>who came up with that.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you, yeah.</p>
<p>But no, he&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s worse than that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because now the mistakes aren&rsquo;t being driven</p>
<p>just by sloppiness or laziness or just a lack of expertise.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s being driven by an agenda.</p>
<p>So just to give you an example on the Slate thing,</p>
<p>the Slate article actually wasn&rsquo;t bad.</p>
<p>It kind of made us seem, you know, cool.</p>
<p>The sub headline was,</p>
<p>a close listen to all in the infuriating,</p>
<p>fascinating safe space for Silicon Valley&rsquo;s money men.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But the headline changed.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if you guys noticed this.</p>
<p>The headline now is Elon Musk&rsquo;s inner circle</p>
<p>is telling us exactly what it thinks.</p>
<p>First of all, like they&rsquo;re trying to-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Elon for clicks.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s Elon for, so they&rsquo;re trying way too hard</p>
<p>to like describe us in terms of Elon,</p>
<p>which, you know, is maybe two episodes out of 110.</p>
<p>But before inner circle, the word they used was cronies.</p>
<p>And then somebody edited it because I saw cronies</p>
<p>in like one of those tweet, you know, summaries,</p>
<p>you know, where like it does a capsule or whatever.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And those get frozen in time.</p>
<p>So, you know, they were trying to bash us even harder</p>
<p>and then somebody took another look at it</p>
<p>and toned it down.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s what happened.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what happens in the editorial process.</p>
<p>Whoever writes the article, the article gets submitted.</p>
<p>Maybe it gets edited, proofread, whatever.</p>
<p>Maybe it doesn&rsquo;t even in some publications</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have the time for it</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re in a race.</p>
<p>Then they pick, there&rsquo;s somebody who&rsquo;s really good</p>
<p>at social media.</p>
<p>They picked six or seven headlines, they AB test them.</p>
<p>And they even have software for this</p>
<p>where they will run a test.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;ll do a paid test.</p>
<p>They put $5 in ads on social media,</p>
<p>whichever one performs the best,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the one they go with.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s even more cynical.</p>
<p>And because people who read the headlines,</p>
<p>sometimes they don&rsquo;t read the story, right?</p>
<p>Obviously most people just see the headline,</p>
<p>they interpret that as a story.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I told you</p>
<p>when they did that new Republic piece on you</p>
<p>with that horrific monstrous monstrosity of an illustration,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>People just read the headline.</p>
<p>They know you&rsquo;re important.</p>
<p>Nobody reads the story anyway.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t a bad article actually.</p>
<p>It was well-written actually, I was in shock.</p>
<p>I was like, who is this writer</p>
<p>that actually took the time to write some prose</p>
<p>that was actually decent?</p>
<p>Yeah, he had listened to a lot of episodes clearly.</p>
<p>That was a really good moment actually.</p>
<p>That was great advice because you gave it to him</p>
<p>and you gave it to me</p>
<p>because both of us had these things</p>
<p>and Jason said the same thing.</p>
<p>Just look at the picture.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re okay with the picture, just move on.</p>
<p>And I thought, this can&rsquo;t be true.</p>
<p>And it turned out to mostly be true.</p>
<p>Yeah, but my picture was terrible.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s close to reality, so.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of, I mean, oh, geez.</p>
<p>I mean, the person who did the worst there was Peter Thiel.</p>
<p>Poor, poor Peter.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that just shows how ridiculously biased it is,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>My picture wasn&rsquo;t so bad.</p>
<p>Hugh Grant.</p>
<p>Elon, let&rsquo;s pull that up one more time here.</p>
<p>Elon looks like Hugh Grant.</p>
<p>I just kind of- Yeah, he does.</p>
<p>He does. Kind of not bad.</p>
<p>Kind of looks like Hugh Grant in like, Notting Hill.</p>
<p>I knew that article was gonna be fine</p>
<p>when the first item they presented</p>
<p>as evidence of me doing something wrong</p>
<p>was basically helping to oust Chesa Boudin,</p>
<p>which was something that was supported</p>
<p>by like 70% of San Francisco,</p>
<p>which is a 90% Democratic city.</p>
<p>So not exactly evidence of some, you know,</p>
<p>out of control right-wing movement.</p>
<p>Look at the headline.</p>
<p>The Quiet Political Rise of David Sachs,</p>
<p>Silicon Valley&rsquo;s Prophet of Urban Doom.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just letting you know,</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t get past the sixth word in the image.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 99% of people were like, oh my God,</p>
<p>congrats on the, you know, Republic article.</p>
<p>It could have literally been Laurel,</p>
<p>what do they call them?</p>
<p>Laurel Ipsums, you know?</p>
<p>Like it could have just been filler words</p>
<p>from their second graph down and nobody would know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But now apparently if you notice</p>
<p>that San Francisco streets look like, you know,</p>
<p>walking dead that apparently you&rsquo;re a prophet of urban doom.</p>
<p>I mean, people are so out of touch.</p>
<p>I mean, they can&rsquo;t even acknowledge</p>
<p>what people can see with their own eyes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the bias that&rsquo;s gotten crazy.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw this</p>
<p>really horrible dystopian video of an art gallery owner</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been dealing with owning a storefront</p>
<p>in San Francisco, which is challenging,</p>
<p>having to clean up feces and, you know,</p>
<p>trash and whatever every day.</p>
<p>And I guess the guy snapped and he&rsquo;s hosing down</p>
<p>a homeless person who refuses to leave</p>
<p>the front of his store.</p>
<p>Oh, I saw that.</p>
<p>I saw that.</p>
<p>Just like the humanity in this is just insane.</p>
<p>Like really like you&rsquo;re hosing a human being down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>Who is obviously not living a great life</p>
<p>and is, you know, in dire straits.</p>
<p>I can feel for both of them, J. Cal.</p>
<p>I can feel for both of them.</p>
<p>I agree that it&rsquo;s not good to hose a human being down.</p>
<p>On the other hand, think about the sense of frustration</p>
<p>that store owner has,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s watching his business go in the toilet</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s got homeless people living in front of him.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re both like being mistreated.</p>
<p>The homeless person is being mistreated.</p>
<p>Say more about the store owner.</p>
<p>Say more.</p>
<p>The homeless person is being mistreated.</p>
<p>The store owner is being mistreated</p>
<p>by the city of San Francisco.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Say more about the store owner.</p>
<p>That person&rsquo;s not in a privileged position.</p>
<p>The store owner, the store owner,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s probably fighting to stay in business.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying, I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s right,</p>
<p>but I think-</p>
<p>No, no, I&rsquo;m just, I&rsquo;m laying the rope.</p>
<p>No, I mean, look, I&rsquo;m just saying,</p>
<p>no, what you&rsquo;re trying to do,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re trying to do is,</p>
<p>oh my God, look at this homeless person</p>
<p>being horribly oppressed.</p>
<p>No, that store owner is a victim too.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s no doubt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s horrible to run a business.</p>
<p>What is that person supposed to do?</p>
<p>No, wait, this is symbolic of the breaking down</p>
<p>of basic society.</p>
<p>Like, both of these people are obviously like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a horrible moment to even witness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, it&rsquo;s like something-</p>
<p>Jason, do you have equal empathy for the store owner</p>
<p>and the homeless person or no?</p>
<p>Under no circumstances should you hose a person down</p>
<p>in the face who is homeless.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s just horrific to watch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just inhumane.</p>
<p>This is a human being.</p>
<p>Now, but as a person who owns a store,</p>
<p>yeah, my dad grew up in the local business.</p>
<p>If people were abusing the store</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to make a living</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got to clean up, you know,</p>
<p>whatever, excrement every day,</p>
<p>which is horrific, yes.</p>
<p>And this thing is dystopian.</p>
<p>In that moment, the empathy is not equal.</p>
<p>I think you have more empathy, obviously,</p>
<p>for the person on the receiving end of that hose.</p>
<p>Okay, but in general,</p>
<p>our society has tons of empathy for homeless people.</p>
<p>We spend billions of dollars trying to solve that problem.</p>
<p>You never hear a thing about the store owners</p>
<p>who are going out of business.</p>
<p>So on a societal level,</p>
<p>you know, not in that moment, but in general,</p>
<p>the lack of empathy is for these middle-class store owners</p>
<p>who may not even be middle-class, working class,</p>
<p>who are struggling to stay afloat.</p>
<p>And you look at something like, what is it,</p>
<p>like a quarter or a third of the storefronts</p>
<p>in San Francisco are now vacant?</p>
<p>The city has destroyed these businesses.</p>
<p>The shocking thing is like,</p>
<p>this person is running an art gallery storefront</p>
<p>in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Like, why would you even bother?</p>
<p>Why would you bother to have a storefront in San Francisco?</p>
<p>I mean, everybody&rsquo;s left.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just-</p>
<p>What do you mean, why do you bother?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve opened a store,</p>
<p>what are you supposed to do,</p>
<p>start to code all of a sudden?</p>
<p>Well, no.</p>
<p>I mean, you would shut it down at some point</p>
<p>and find an exit.</p>
<p>And do what?</p>
<p>Yeah, but a store has large fixed costs, right?</p>
<p>So that may be an investment he made 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>At some point,</p>
<p>you have to shut down your store in San Francisco</p>
<p>the second you can get out of the lease.</p>
<p>The solution to everything, J. Cal,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t go to coding school online</p>
<p>and then, you know, end up working for Google.</p>
<p>Oh, I didn&rsquo;t say it was, I&rsquo;m just&hellip;</p>
<p>But moving to another city is a possibility.</p>
<p>So true.</p>
<p>A lot of folks in Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>I think, in this weirdly fucked up way,</p>
<p>do believe the solution to everything is learn to code.</p>
<p>Or become an Uber driver.</p>
<p>Or become a masseuse.</p>
<p>Get a gig job.</p>
<p>Get a gig job.</p>
<p>Or the guy spent years building his retail business.</p>
<p>I mean, the thing is-</p>
<p>And then a homeless person camps in front,</p>
<p>and he calls the police.</p>
<p>The police don&rsquo;t come and move the homeless person.</p>
<p>The homeless person stays there.</p>
<p>He asks nicely to move.</p>
<p>Customers are uncomfortable going in the store as a result.</p>
<p>Yeah, I stopped going to certain stores in my neighborhood</p>
<p>because of homeless tents being literally fixated</p>
<p>in front of the store.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d go to the store down the road</p>
<p>to get my groceries or whatever.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, it&rsquo;s not a kind of uncommon situation</p>
<p>for a lot of these small business owners.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t own the real estate.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re paying rent.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got high labor costs.</p>
<p>You know, everything&rsquo;s inflating.</p>
<p>Generally, city population&rsquo;s declining.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a brutal situation all around.</p>
<p>I think if everybody learns to code or drives an Uber,</p>
<p>the problem is that in the absence of things</p>
<p>like local stores and small businesses,</p>
<p>you hollow out communities.</p>
<p>You have these random detached places</p>
<p>where you kind of live,</p>
<p>and then you sit in your house,</p>
<p>which becomes a prison while you order food</p>
<p>from an app every day.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that is the society that people want.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I kind of want small businesses to exist.</p>
<p>And I think that the homeless person should be taken care of,</p>
<p>but the small business person should have the best chance</p>
<p>of trying to be successful,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s hard enough as it is.</p>
<p>The mortality rate of the small business owner</p>
<p>is already 90%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible in San Francisco, let&rsquo;s just be honest.</p>
<p>So stop genuflecting, Jay Cowell.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not genuflecting.</p>
<p>Listen.</p>
<p>Yeah, you are, because here&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Wait, how am I genuflecting?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying the guy,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just shocked that the guy even has a storefront.</p>
<p>I would have left a long time ago.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re showing a tweet that&rsquo;s a moment in time,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not showing the 10 steps that led up to it.</p>
<p>Oh, 1,000 steps.</p>
<p>The five times he called the police</p>
<p>to do something about it.</p>
<p>I framed it as dystopian from the get.</p>
<p>The lost customers.</p>
<p>The stuff that Freeberg and Chamath</p>
<p>were just talking about.</p>
<p>Or maybe there was physical conflict</p>
<p>that we didn&rsquo;t see in that,</p>
<p>you know, and he&rsquo;s resolving it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, who knows, man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to look at these videos</p>
<p>and know what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awful to see, but man, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awful.</p>
<p>And actually, you want to know another reason</p>
<p>why we can&rsquo;t solve this problem?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the language we use around it.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem here is not homeless.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s addiction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s addiction, and it&rsquo;s mental illness.</p>
<p>Schellenberger&rsquo;s done the work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like he said, 99% of the people he talks to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s either mental illness or addiction.</p>
<p>But we keep using this word homeless</p>
<p>to describe the problem.</p>
<p>But the issue here is not the lack of housing,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s a separate problem in California,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s basically the lack of treatment.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>So we should be calling them treatmentless.</p>
<p>And mandates around this because-</p>
<p>Well, and enforcement.</p>
<p>You cannot have a super drug be available</p>
<p>for a nominal price and give people,</p>
<p>you know, a bunch of money to come here</p>
<p>and take it and not enforce it.</p>
<p>You have to draw the line at Fentanyl.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, Fentanyl is a super drug.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s three alternatives.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s mandated rehab, mandated mental health,</p>
<p>or jail, or, you know, housing services.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not breaking the law, you don&rsquo;t have mental illness,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have drug addiction.</p>
<p>And then provide, those are the four paths</p>
<p>of outcome here of success.</p>
<p>And if all four of those paths were both mandated</p>
<p>and available in abundance,</p>
<p>this could be a tractable problem.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the mandate, I mean,</p>
<p>you guys remember that Kevin Bacon movie</p>
<p>where Kevin Bacon was locked up in a mental institution,</p>
<p>but he wasn&rsquo;t like, he wasn&rsquo;t mentally ill.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a famous story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a famous- Footloose?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Footloose.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a famous story.</p>
<p>I think you guys, someone&rsquo;s probably gonna</p>
<p>call me an idiot for messing this whole thing up.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s a story</p>
<p>where mandated mental health services,</p>
<p>like locking people up to take care of them</p>
<p>when they have mental health issues like this,</p>
<p>became kind of inhumane.</p>
<p>And a lot of the institutions were shut down</p>
<p>and a lot of the laws were overturned.</p>
<p>And there are many of these cases that happened</p>
<p>where they came across as like torturous</p>
<p>to what happened to people that weren&rsquo;t mentally ill.</p>
<p>And so the idea was like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just abandon the entire approach.</p>
<p>One flew over the cuckoo&rsquo;s nest?</p>
<p>You think about one flew over the cuckoo&rsquo;s nest?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s another one, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s unfortunate, but I think that there&rsquo;s some,</p>
<p>you know, we talk a lot about nuance and gray areas,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s certainly some solution here</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t black or white.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about not having mandated mental health services,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not about locking everyone up</p>
<p>that has some slight problem,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some solution here that needs to be crafted</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t let people suffer</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t let people suffer</p>
<p>both as the victim on the street,</p>
<p>but also the victim in the community.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about a 51-50, I think,</p>
<p>like when people are held because they&rsquo;re a danger</p>
<p>to themselves or others kind of thing.</p>
<p>Right, but Jacob,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s think about the power of language here.</p>
<p>If we refer to these people as untreated persons,</p>
<p>instead of homeless persons,</p>
<p>and that was the coverage 24-7 in the media</p>
<p>is this is an untreated person.</p>
<p>The whole policy prescription would be completely different.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d realize there&rsquo;s a shortage of treatment.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d realize there&rsquo;s a shortage of remedies</p>
<p>related to getting people in treatment</p>
<p>as opposed to building housing, but why-</p>
<p>And laws that mandate it, that don&rsquo;t enable it,</p>
<p>because if you don&rsquo;t mandate it,</p>
<p>then you enable the free reign</p>
<p>and the free living on the street</p>
<p>and the open drug markets and all this sort of stuff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a really easy test for this.</p>
<p>If it was yourself and you were addicted,</p>
<p>or if it was a loved one,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of your immediate family members,</p>
<p>would you want yourself or somebody else</p>
<p>to be picked up off the street</p>
<p>and held with a 51-50 or whatever code</p>
<p>involuntarily against their will</p>
<p>because they were a danger?</p>
<p>Would you want them to be allowed to remain on the street?</p>
<p>Would you want yourself if you were in that dire straits?</p>
<p>And the answer, of course,</p>
<p>is you would want somebody to intervene-</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s the liberal policy perspective</p>
<p>on this, J. Cal?</p>
<p>So let me ask you as our diehard liberal on this show-</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not a diehard liberal, no.</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s an independent and only votes for Democrats.</p>
<p>Please get it right.</p>
<p>75% of the time I voted Democrat, 25% Republican.</p>
<p>Independent votes for Democrats, okay.</p>
<p>25% Republicans.</p>
<p>Is it not that your individual liberties</p>
<p>are infringed upon if you were to be,</p>
<p>quote, picked up and put away?</p>
<p>You know, my position on it</p>
<p>is if you&rsquo;re not thinking straight</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re high on fentanyl,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not thinking for yourself</p>
<p>and you could lose the liberty</p>
<p>for a small period of time, 72 hours a week.</p>
<p>You know, especially if you&rsquo;re a danger to somebody,</p>
<p>you know, yourself or other people.</p>
<p>And in this case, if you&rsquo;re on fentanyl,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re on meth, you&rsquo;re a danger to society.</p>
<p>I mean, I think if more people had that,</p>
<p>if more people had that point of view</p>
<p>and had that debate, as Saxe is saying,</p>
<p>in a more open way,</p>
<p>you could get to some path to resolution on-</p>
<p>Just not in San Francisco.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not how it happens.</p>
<p>So you guys know this, we won&rsquo;t say who it is,</p>
<p>but someone in my family</p>
<p>has some pretty severe mental health issues.</p>
<p>And the problem is,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re an adult,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get them to get any form of treatment whatsoever.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>You only have the nuclear option.</p>
<p>And the nuclear option is you basically</p>
<p>take that person to court</p>
<p>and try to seize their power of attorney,</p>
<p>which is essentially saying that, you know-</p>
<p>Individual liberties are gone.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And by the way, it is so unbelievably restrictive</p>
<p>what happens if you lose that power of attorney</p>
<p>and somebody else has it over you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a huge burden that</p>
<p>the legal system makes extremely difficult.</p>
<p>And the problem-</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s why the law is a backstop.</p>
<p>You know, if the person&rsquo;s committing something illegal,</p>
<p>like camping out or doing fentanyl, meth, whatever,</p>
<p>you can use the law as the backstop, you know,</p>
<p>against personal liberty. You can&rsquo;t use the law.</p>
<p>All that person can do is really get arrested.</p>
<p>Even that is not a high enough bar</p>
<p>to actually get power of attorney over somebody.</p>
<p>The other thing that I just wanted you guys to know,</p>
<p>I think you know this,</p>
<p>but just a little historical context,</p>
<p>is a lot of this crisis in mental health started</p>
<p>because Reagan defunded all the psychiatric hospitals.</p>
<p>He emptied them in California and that compounded,</p>
<p>because for whatever reason,</p>
<p>his ideology was that these things</p>
<p>should be treated in a different way.</p>
<p>And when he got to the presidency,</p>
<p>one of the things that he did was</p>
<p>he repealed the Mental Health-</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s called the Mental Health Systems Act, MHSA,</p>
<p>which completely broke down</p>
<p>some pretty landmark legislation on mental health.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve ever really recovered</p>
<p>in that we&rsquo;re now 42 years onward from 1980,</p>
<p>but, or 43 years onward.</p>
<p>But just something for you guys to know that that&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>Reagan had a lot of positives,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s one definitely negative check in my book</p>
<p>against his legacy is his stance</p>
<p>on mental health in general</p>
<p>and what he did to defund mental health.</p>
<p>Well, let me make two points there.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m not defending that specific decision.</p>
<p>There were a bunch of scandals in the 1970s</p>
<p>and epitomized by the movie,</p>
<p>One Flew Over the Cuckoo&rsquo;s Nest with Jack Nicholson,</p>
<p>about the conditions in these mental health homes.</p>
<p>And that did create a groundswell</p>
<p>to change laws around that.</p>
<p>But I think this idea that somehow Reagan is to blame</p>
<p>when he hasn&rsquo;t been in office for 50 years,</p>
<p>as opposed to the politicians</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve been in office for the last 20 years,</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s letting them off the hook.</p>
<p>I mean, Gavin Newsom, 10, 15 years ago,</p>
<p>when he was mayor of San Francisco,</p>
<p>declared that he would end homelessness within 10 years.</p>
<p>He just made another declaration like that as governor.</p>
<p>So, I just feel like-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s Reagan&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying-</p>
<p>Well, I just think it&rsquo;s interesting historical moment.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s letting the politicians off the hook.</p>
<p>Society needs to start thinking about changing priorities.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have this problem</p>
<p>of massive numbers of people living on the streets</p>
<p>10, 15 years ago.</p>
<p>It was a much smaller problem.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of it has to do with fentanyl.</p>
<p>The power of these drugs has increased massively.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other things going on here.</p>
<p>So, in any event, I mean,</p>
<p>you can question what Reagan did</p>
<p>in light of current conditions,</p>
<p>but I think this problem really started</p>
<p>in the last 10, 15 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like in an order of magnitude bigger way.</p>
<p>These are super drugs until people realize</p>
<p>like these are a different class of drugs</p>
<p>and they start treating them as such.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna just get worse.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no path.</p>
<p>Oh, as far as I know,</p>
<p>Reagan didn&rsquo;t hand out to these addicts $800 a week</p>
<p>to feed their addiction</p>
<p>so they can live on the streets of San Francisco.</p>
<p>That is the current policy of the city.</p>
<p>I hear you.</p>
<p>All I just wanted to just provide</p>
<p>was just that color that we had a system of funding</p>
<p>for the mental health infrastructure,</p>
<p>particularly local mental health infrastructure.</p>
<p>And we took that back and then we never came forward.</p>
<p>And all I was saying is I&rsquo;m just telling you</p>
<p>where that decision was.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s part of the solution here is,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have to basically build up shelters.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna have to build up homes.</p>
<p>And to support your point,</p>
<p>the problem now, for example,</p>
<p>is Gavin Newsom says a lot of these things</p>
<p>and now he&rsquo;s gone from a massive surplus</p>
<p>to a $25 billion deficit overnight,</p>
<p>which we talked about even a year ago</p>
<p>because that was just the law of numbers</p>
<p>catching up with the state of California.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s not in a position now to do any of this stuff.</p>
<p>So this whole problem may get worse.</p>
<p>Well, they did appropriate,</p>
<p>I forget the number,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like 10 billion or something out of that,</p>
<p>huge budget they had to solve the problem of homelessness.</p>
<p>I would just argue they&rsquo;re not tackling it in the right way</p>
<p>because what happened is there&rsquo;s a giant special interest</p>
<p>that formed around this problem,</p>
<p>which is the building industry</p>
<p>who gets these contracts to build the quote,</p>
<p>affordable housing or the-</p>
<p>Homeless industrial complex is insane.</p>
<p>They end up building 10 units at a time on Venice beach,</p>
<p>like the most expensive land you could possibly build</p>
<p>because you get these contracts from the government.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s now a giant special interest in lobby</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s formed around this.</p>
<p>If you really want to solve the problem,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t be building housing on Venice beach,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be going to cheap land just outside the city</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d be building scale shelters.</p>
<p>I mean, shelters that can house 10,000 people,</p>
<p>not 10, and you&rsquo;d be having treatment services.</p>
<p>But they also have to get treatment, yes.</p>
<p>But with treatment built into them, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be solving this problem at scale</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>By the way, do you guys want to hear this week in grift?</p>
<p>Sure, we&rsquo;re all in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great example of grift.</p>
<p>I read something today in Bloomberg that was unbelievable.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s about $2 trillion of debt</p>
<p>owned by the developing world</p>
<p>that has been classified by a nonprofit,</p>
<p>the Nature Conservancy in this case,</p>
<p>as eligible for what they called nature swaps.</p>
<p>So this is 2 trillion of the umpteen trillions of debt</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s about to get defaulted on by countries like Belize,</p>
<p>Ecuador, Sri Lanka, Seychelles, you name it.</p>
<p>And what happens now are the big bulge bracket,</p>
<p>Wall Street banks and the Nature Conservancy</p>
<p>goes to these countries and says, listen,</p>
<p>you have a billion dollar tranche of debt</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s about to go upside down</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna be in default with the IMF,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll let you off the hook.</p>
<p>And we will negotiate with those bondholders</p>
<p>to give them 50 cents on the dollar.</p>
<p>But in return, you have to promise</p>
<p>to take some of that savings and protect the rainforest</p>
<p>or protect a coral reef or protect some mangrove trees.</p>
<p>All sounds good.</p>
<p>Except then what these folks do</p>
<p>is they take that repackaged debt,</p>
<p>they call it ESG, they mark it back up</p>
<p>and then they sell it to folks like BlackRock</p>
<p>who have decided that they must own this in the portfolio.</p>
<p>So it literally just goes from one sleeve of BlackRock,</p>
<p>which is now marked toxic emerging market debt,</p>
<p>and then it gets into someone&rsquo;s 401k as ESG debt.</p>
<p>Is that unbelievable?</p>
<p>So you convert your signal and buy some ESG</p>
<p>to make yourself feel good, yeah.</p>
<p>$2 trillion of this paper.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s all you have to know about ESG</p>
<p>is that Exxon is like the number seven,</p>
<p>like top ranked company according to ESG</p>
<p>and Tesla is even on the list.</p>
<p>Disastrous.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>How crazy is that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complete scam.</p>
<p>All of those, we&rsquo;ve said this many times,</p>
<p>but each of those letters individually mean so much</p>
<p>and should be worth a lot to a lot of people.</p>
<p>But when you stick them together,</p>
<p>it creates this toxic soup</p>
<p>where you can just hide the cheese.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, governance is important in companies.</p>
<p>Of course, the environment is important.</p>
<p>Social change is important.</p>
<p>I mean, but why are these things grouped together in this?</p>
<p>It just perverts the whole thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an industry, J. Cal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an industry of consultants.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>All right, speaking of grifts,</p>
<p>Microsoft is going to put $10 billion or something</p>
<p>into chat GPT.</p>
<p>Degenerate AI, as I&rsquo;m calling it now,</p>
<p>is the hottest thing in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>The technology is incredible.</p>
<p>I mean, you can question the business model maybe,</p>
<p>but the technology is pretty.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;d say is $29 billion for a company</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s losing a billion dollars in Azure credits a year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one way to look at it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also a naive way to look at a lot of other businesses</p>
<p>that ended up being worth a lot down the road.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>You can model out the future of a business like this</p>
<p>and create a lot of really compelling big outcomes.</p>
<p>Potentially, yeah.</p>
<p>So Microsoft is close to investing 10 billion in open AI</p>
<p>in a very convoluted transaction</p>
<p>that people are trying to understand.</p>
<p>It turns out that they might wind up owning 59% of open AI,</p>
<p>but get 75% of the cash and profits back over time.</p>
<p>49%.</p>
<p>49%, yeah, of open AI.</p>
<p>But they would get paid back the $10 billion</p>
<p>over some amount of time.</p>
<p>And this obviously includes Azure credits and chat GPT.</p>
<p>As everybody knows, this just incredible demonstration</p>
<p>of what AI can do in terms of text-based creation</p>
<p>of content and answering queries</p>
<p>is taking the net by storm.</p>
<p>People are really inspired by it.</p>
<p>Sax, do you think that this is</p>
<p>a defensible, real technology,</p>
<p>or do you think this is like a crazy hype cycle?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s definitely the next VC hype cycle.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s kind of glomming onto this</p>
<p>because VC really right now needs a savior.</p>
<p>Just look at the public markets,</p>
<p>everything we&rsquo;re investing in is in the toilets.</p>
<p>So we all really wanna believe</p>
<p>that this is gonna be the next wave.</p>
<p>And just because something is a VC hype cycle</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>So as I think one of our friends pointed out,</p>
<p>mobile turned out to be very real.</p>
<p>I think cloud turned out to be, I&rsquo;d say, very real.</p>
<p>Social was sort of real in the sense</p>
<p>that it did lead to a few big winners.</p>
<p>On the other hand, web three and crypto</p>
<p>was a hype cycle and it&rsquo;s turned into a big bust.</p>
<p>VR falls into the hype cycle.</p>
<p>I think VR is probably a hype cycle so far.</p>
<p>No one can even explain what web three is.</p>
<p>In terms of AI, I think that if I had to guess,</p>
<p>I would say the hype is real</p>
<p>in terms of its technological potential.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m not sure about how much potential</p>
<p>there is yet for VCs to participate</p>
<p>because right now it seems like</p>
<p>this is something that&rsquo;s gonna be done</p>
<p>by really big companies.</p>
<p>So open AI is basically a,</p>
<p>it looks like kind of a Microsoft proxy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got Google, I&rsquo;m sure will develop it</p>
<p>through their DeepMind asset.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m sure Facebook</p>
<p>is gonna do something huge in AI.</p>
<p>So what I don&rsquo;t know is, is this really a platform</p>
<p>that startups are gonna be able to benefit from?</p>
<p>I will say that some of the companies we&rsquo;ve invested in</p>
<p>are starting to use these tools.</p>
<p>So I guess where I am is,</p>
<p>I think the technology is actually exciting.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t go overboard on the valuations.</p>
<p>So I wouldn&rsquo;t buy into that level of hype.</p>
<p>But you think there could be hundreds of companies</p>
<p>built around an API for something like ChatGPT, Dolly?</p>
<p>Maybe, yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think startups are gonna be able</p>
<p>to create the AI themselves,</p>
<p>but they might be able to benefit from the APIs.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing that has to be proven out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of really fantastic machine learning</p>
<p>services available through cloud vendors today, right?</p>
<p>So Azure has been one of these kind of vendors</p>
<p>and obviously OpenAI is building tools</p>
<p>a little bit further down on the stack.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of tooling that can be used</p>
<p>for specific vertical applications.</p>
<p>Obviously the acquisition of InstaDeep by BioNTech</p>
<p>is a really solid example.</p>
<p>And most of the big dollars</p>
<p>that are flowing in biotech right now</p>
<p>are flowing into machine learning applications</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s some vertical application</p>
<p>of machine learning tooling and techniques</p>
<p>around some specific problem set.</p>
<p>And the problem set of mimicking human communication</p>
<p>and doing generative media is a consumer application set</p>
<p>that has a whole bunch</p>
<p>of really interesting product opportunities.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s not kind of be blind to the fact</p>
<p>that nearly every other industry</p>
<p>and nearly every other vertical is being transformed today</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s active progress being made in funding</p>
<p>and getting liquidity on companies</p>
<p>and progress with actual products being driven</p>
<p>by machine learning systems.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of great examples of this.</p>
<p>So the fundamental capabilities of large data sets</p>
<p>and then using these kind of learning techniques</p>
<p>in software and statistical models</p>
<p>to make kind of predictions and drive businesses forward</p>
<p>in a way that they&rsquo;re not able to</p>
<p>with just human knowledge and human capability alone</p>
<p>is really real and it&rsquo;s here today.</p>
<p>And so I think let&rsquo;s not get caught up in the fact</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s this really interesting</p>
<p>consumer market hype cycle going on</p>
<p>where these tools are not being kind of validated</p>
<p>and generating real value</p>
<p>across many other verticals and segments.</p>
<p>Chamath, when you look at this Microsoft OpenAI deal</p>
<p>and you see something that&rsquo;s this convoluted,</p>
<p>hard to understand, what does that signal to you</p>
<p>as a capital allocator and company builder?</p>
<p>I would put deals into two categories.</p>
<p>One is easy and straightforward.</p>
<p>And then two is, you know, cute by half</p>
<p>or, you know, the two hard bucket.</p>
<p>This is clearly in that second category,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t mean that-</p>
<p>Why is it in that category?</p>
<p>Well, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that it won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>In our group chat with the rest of the guys,</p>
<p>one person said, there&rsquo;s a lot of complex law</p>
<p>when you go from a nonprofit to a for-profit,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s lots of complexity in deal construction.</p>
<p>The original investors have certain things</p>
<p>that they want to see.</p>
<p>There may or may not be, you know, legal issues at play here</p>
<p>that you encapsulated well in the last episode.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s important to just like,</p>
<p>give those folks the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>But yeah, if you&rsquo;re asking me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the two hard bucket for me to really take seriously.</p>
<p>Now, that being said, it&rsquo;s not like I got shown the deal.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t comment.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I will say.</p>
<p>The first part of what Zach said,</p>
<p>that I think is really important</p>
<p>for entrepreneurs to internalize,</p>
<p>which is where can we make money?</p>
<p>The reality is that, well, let me just take a prediction.</p>
<p>I think that Google will open source their models</p>
<p>because the most important thing that Google can do</p>
<p>is reinforce the value of search.</p>
<p>And the best way to do that</p>
<p>is to scorch the earth with these models,</p>
<p>which is to make them widely available</p>
<p>and as free as possible.</p>
<p>That will cause Microsoft to have to catch up.</p>
<p>And that will cause Facebook</p>
<p>to have to really look in the mirror</p>
<p>and decide whether they&rsquo;re going to cap</p>
<p>the betting that they&rsquo;ve made on AR VR</p>
<p>and reallocate very aggressively to AI.</p>
<p>I mentioned this in the, I did this Lex Friedman podcast,</p>
<p>but that should be what Facebook does.</p>
<p>And the reason is if Facebook and Google and Microsoft</p>
<p>have roughly the same capability and the same model,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an element of machine learning</p>
<p>that I think is very important,</p>
<p>which is called reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>And specifically it&rsquo;s reinforcement learning</p>
<p>from human feedback, right?</p>
<p>So these RLHF pipelines,</p>
<p>these are the things that will make your stuff unique.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a startup,</p>
<p>you can build a reinforcement learning pipeline.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>You build a product that captures a bunch of usage.</p>
<p>We talked about this before.</p>
<p>That data set is unique to you as a company.</p>
<p>You can feed that into these models,</p>
<p>get back better answers.</p>
<p>You can make money from it.</p>
<p>Facebook has an enormous amount</p>
<p>of reinforcement learning inside of Facebook.</p>
<p>Every click, every comment, every like, every share.</p>
<p>Twitter has that data set.</p>
<p>Google inside of Gmail and search.</p>
<p>Microsoft inside of Minecraft and Hotmail.</p>
<p>So my point is David&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>The huge companies, I think, will create the substrates.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;ll be forced to scorch the earth</p>
<p>and give it away for free.</p>
<p>And then on top of that is where you can make money.</p>
<p>And I would just encourage entrepreneurs to think,</p>
<p>where is my edge in creating a data set</p>
<p>that I can use for reinforcement learning?</p>
<p>That I think is interesting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of saying,</p>
<p>I buy the ingredients from the supermarket,</p>
<p>but then I can still construct a dish that&rsquo;s unique.</p>
<p>And the salt is there, the pepper is there,</p>
<p>but how I use that will determine</p>
<p>whether you like the thing or not.</p>
<p>And I think that that is the way</p>
<p>that I think we need to start thinking about it.</p>
<p>Interestingly, as we&rsquo;ve all pointed out here,</p>
<p>OpenAI was started as a nonprofit.</p>
<p>The stated philosophy was this technology is too powerful</p>
<p>for any company to own.</p>
<p>Therefore, we&rsquo;re going to make it open source.</p>
<p>And then somewhere in the last couple of years,</p>
<p>they said, well, you know what?</p>
<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s too powerful</p>
<p>for it to be out there in the public.</p>
<p>We need to make this a private company,</p>
<p>and we need to get $10 billion from Microsoft.</p>
<p>That is the disconnect I am trying to understand.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most interesting part of the story, Jason.</p>
<p>I think if you go back to 2014,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s when Google bought DeepMind.</p>
<p>And immediately, everyone started reacting</p>
<p>to a company as powerful as Google,</p>
<p>having a toolkit and a team as powerful</p>
<p>as DeepMind within them.</p>
<p>That sort of power should not sit in anyone&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>I heard people that I&rsquo;m close with</p>
<p>that are close to the organization and the company</p>
<p>comment that they thought this is the most</p>
<p>kind of scary, threatening, biggest threat to humanity</p>
<p>is Google&rsquo;s control of DeepMind.</p>
<p>And that was a naive kind of point of view,</p>
<p>but it was one that was deeply held by a lot of people.</p>
<p>So Reid Hoffman, Peter Thiel, Elon Musk,</p>
<p>a lot of these guys funded</p>
<p>the original kind of OpenAI business in 2015.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the link.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m putting it out here.</p>
<p>You guys can pull up the original blog post.</p>
<p>Do all those people who donated get stock in OpenAI?</p>
<p>So what happened was it was all in a nonprofit.</p>
<p>And then the nonprofit owned stock</p>
<p>in a commercial business now.</p>
<p>But your point is interesting,</p>
<p>because at the beginning, the idea was</p>
<p>instead of having Google own all of this,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll make it all available.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the statement</p>
<p>from the original blog post in 2015.</p>
<p>OpenAI is a nonprofit AI research company.</p>
<p>Our goal is to advance digital intelligence</p>
<p>in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity</p>
<p>as a whole, unconstrained</p>
<p>by a need to generate financial return.</p>
<p>Since our research is free from financial obligations,</p>
<p>we can better focus on a positive human impact.</p>
<p>And they kind of went on and the whole thing</p>
<p>about Sam, Greg, Elon, Reid, Jessica,</p>
<p>Peter Thiel, AWS, YC are all donating to support OpenAI,</p>
<p>including donations and commitments of over a billion</p>
<p>dollars, although we expect that to only be</p>
<p>a tiny fraction of what we will spend</p>
<p>in the next few years,</p>
<p>which is a really interesting kind of,</p>
<p>if you look back historical perspective</p>
<p>on how this thing all started seven years ago,</p>
<p>and how quickly it&rsquo;s evolved, as you point out,</p>
<p>into the necessity to have a real commercial alignment</p>
<p>to drive this thing forward without seeing</p>
<p>any of these models open sourced.</p>
<p>And during that same period of time,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen Google share AlphaFold</p>
<p>and share a number of predictive models</p>
<p>and toolkits and make them publicly available</p>
<p>and put them in Google&rsquo;s cloud.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s both kind of tooling and models</p>
<p>and outputs of those models that Google has open sourced</p>
<p>and made freely available.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, OpenAI has kind of diverged</p>
<p>into this deeply profitable, profit-seeking</p>
<p>kind of enterprise model.</p>
<p>And when you invest in OpenAI in the round</p>
<p>that they did before, you could generate</p>
<p>a financial return capped at 100X,</p>
<p>which is still a pretty amazing financial return.</p>
<p>You put a billion dollars in,</p>
<p>you can make a hundred billion dollars.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s funding a real commercial endeavor at that point.</p>
<p>Well, and then to-</p>
<p>It is the most striking question about this whole thing,</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going on in our AI.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one that Elon&rsquo;s talked about publicly</p>
<p>and others have kind of sat on one side or the other,</p>
<p>which is that AI offers a glimpse</p>
<p>into one of the biggest</p>
<p>and most kind of existential threats to humanity.</p>
<p>And the question we&rsquo;re all gonna be tackling</p>
<p>and the battle that&rsquo;s gonna be happening politically</p>
<p>and regulatory-wise, and perhaps even between nations</p>
<p>in the years to come, is who owns the AI?</p>
<p>Who owns the models?</p>
<p>What can they do with it?</p>
<p>And what are we legally gonna be allowed to do with it?</p>
<p>And this is a really important part of that story, yeah.</p>
<p>To build on what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>I just put in PyTorch, for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another framework, P-Y-T-O-R-C-H.</p>
<p>This was, you know, largely built inside of Facebook.</p>
<p>And then Facebook said,</p>
<p>hey, we want to democratize machine learning.</p>
<p>And they made, and I think they put a bunch of executives,</p>
<p>they may have even funded those executives</p>
<p>to go work on this open-source project.</p>
<p>So they have a huge stake in this,</p>
<p>and they went very open-source with it.</p>
<p>And then TensorFlow, which you have an investment in,</p>
<p>Chamath, TensorFlow was inside of-</p>
<p>No, no, I don&rsquo;t have an investment in TensorFlow.</p>
<p>We built-</p>
<p>No, no, TensorFlow, the public source,</p>
<p>came out of Google,</p>
<p>and then you invested in another company.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re building Silicon for machine learning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>Yes, right.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s based on TensorFlow.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, the founder of this company</p>
<p>was the founder of TensorFlow.</p>
<p>Oh, got it, okay.</p>
<p>Sorry, not of TensorFlow, pardon me, of TPU,</p>
<p>which was Google&rsquo;s internal Silicon</p>
<p>that they built to accelerate TensorFlow.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>If that makes sense.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to be cynical about the whole project or not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the confounding part of this</p>
<p>and what is happening here.</p>
<p>It reminds me, I don&rsquo;t know if you remember this,</p>
<p>Chamath, and we were on AOL.</p>
<p>The biggest opportunity here is for Facebook.</p>
<p>I mean, they need to get in this conversation, ASAP.</p>
<p>I mean, to think that, like, look,</p>
<p>PyTorch was like a pretty seminal piece of technology</p>
<p>that a lot of folks in AI and machine learning</p>
<p>were using for a long time.</p>
<p>TensorFlow before that.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s so funny about like Google and Facebook</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re a little bit kind of like,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not really making that much progress.</p>
<p>I mean, Facebook released this kind of like</p>
<p>rando version of AlphaFold recently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that good.</p>
<p>I think these companies really need to get these products</p>
<p>in the wild as soon as possible.</p>
<p>It cannot be the case that you have to email people</p>
<p>and get on some list.</p>
<p>I mean, this is Google and Facebook, guys, come on.</p>
<p>Get going.</p>
<p>This is the, I think the big innovation of OpenAI,</p>
<p>SACS, to bring you in the conversation.</p>
<p>They actually made an interface</p>
<p>and let the public play with it</p>
<p>to the tune of $3 million a day in cloud credits or costs.</p>
<p>Which, you know.</p>
<p>By the way, just on that, my son was telling me,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, hey, dad, do you want me to tell you</p>
<p>when the best time to use chat GPT is?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, huh?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah, my friends and I have tried,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been using it so much.</p>
<p>We know now when we can actually get resources.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s such an interesting thing</p>
<p>where like a 13-year-old kid knows, you know,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s mostly compute intensive that it&rsquo;s unusable</p>
<p>and when to come back and use it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>When&rsquo;s the last time SACS, the technology,</p>
<p>became this mainstream</p>
<p>and captured people&rsquo;s imagination this broadly?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check GPT is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a while.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe the iPhone or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, look, it&rsquo;s powerful.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question it&rsquo;s powerful.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m of two minds about it</p>
<p>because whenever something is the hype cycle,</p>
<p>I just reflexively want to be skeptical of it.</p>
<p>But on the other hand,</p>
<p>we have made a few investments in this area.</p>
<p>And I mean, I think it is powerful</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to be an enabler</p>
<p>of some really cool things to come.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question about it.</p>
<p>I have two pieces of more insider information.</p>
<p>One, I have a chat GPT iOS app on my phone.</p>
<p>One of the nice folks at OpenAI</p>
<p>included me in the test flight.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the simplest interface you&rsquo;ve ever seen,</p>
<p>but basically you type in your question,</p>
<p>but it keeps your history.</p>
<p>And then you can search your history.</p>
<p>So it looks, SACS, like you&rsquo;re in iMessage, basically,</p>
<p>and it has your threads.</p>
<p>And so I asked him,</p>
<p>hey, what are the best restaurants in Yawnville,</p>
<p>in a town near Napa?</p>
<p>And then I said, which one has the best duck?</p>
<p>And it literally like gave me a great answer.</p>
<p>And then I thought, wait a second,</p>
<p>why is this not using a Siri or Alexa-like interface?</p>
<p>And then why isn&rsquo;t it, oh, here&rsquo;s a video of it.</p>
<p>I gave the video to Nick.</p>
<p>By the way, Jason, this, what you&rsquo;re doing right now</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re creating a human feedback</p>
<p>reinforcement learning pipeline for chat GPT.</p>
<p>So just the fact that you asked that question,</p>
<p>and, you know, over time,</p>
<p>if chat GPT has access to your GPS information</p>
<p>and then knows that you went to restaurant A versus B,</p>
<p>it can intuit, and it may actually prompt you to ask,</p>
<p>hey, Jason, we noticed you were in the area.</p>
<p>Did you go to Bottega?</p>
<p>If you did, how would you rate it one through five?</p>
<p>That reinforcement learning now allows the next person</p>
<p>that asks, what are the top five restaurants,</p>
<p>to say, well, you know,</p>
<p>over a thousand people that have asked this question,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s actually the best answer</p>
<p>versus a generic rank of the open web,</p>
<p>which is what the first data set is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so interesting about this.</p>
<p>So this is why, if you&rsquo;re a company</p>
<p>that already owns the eyeballs,</p>
<p>you have to be running to get this stuff out there.</p>
<p>Well, and then this answer, you know, cited Yelp.</p>
<p>Well, this is the first time</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually seen chat GPT cite,</p>
<p>and this is, I think, a major legal breakthrough.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t put a link in,</p>
<p>but if it&rsquo;s gonna use Yelp&rsquo;s data,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they have permission from Yelp,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s quoting Yelp here,</p>
<p>it should link to French Laundry Bottega and Bouchon.</p>
<p>Bouchon actually has the best duck confit for the record,</p>
<p>and I did have that duck,</p>
<p>so I asked this afterwards to see,</p>
<p>you know, in a scenario like this,</p>
<p>but it could also, if I was talking to it,</p>
<p>I could say, hey, which one has availability this afternoon</p>
<p>or tomorrow for dinner,</p>
<p>and make the phone call for me like Google Assistant does,</p>
<p>or any number of next tasks.</p>
<p>This was an incredibly powerful display in a 1.0 product.</p>
<p>I was thinking about what you said last week,</p>
<p>and I thought back to the music industry</p>
<p>in the world of Napster,</p>
<p>and what happened was there was a lot of musicians,</p>
<p>I think Metallica being the most famous one,</p>
<p>famously suing Napster because it was like,</p>
<p>hey, listen, you&rsquo;re allowing people to take my content,</p>
<p>which they would otherwise pay for.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s economic damage that I can measure.</p>
<p>That legal argument was meaningful enough</p>
<p>that ultimately Napster was shut down.</p>
<p>Now, there are other versions of that</p>
<p>that folks created, including us at Winamp.</p>
<p>We created a headless version of that,</p>
<p>but if you translate that problem set here,</p>
<p>is there a claim that Yelp can make in this example</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re losing money?</p>
<p>That, you know, if you were going through Google</p>
<p>or if you are going through their app,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the sponsored link revenue</p>
<p>and the advertising revenue that they would have got</p>
<p>that they wouldn&rsquo;t get from here.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that Chad GPT can&rsquo;t figure that out,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s those kinds of problems</p>
<p>that are gonna be a little thorny in these next few years</p>
<p>that have to really get figured out.</p>
<p>This is a-</p>
<p>If you are a human reading every review on Yelp about duck,</p>
<p>then you could write a blog post in which you say</p>
<p>many reviewers on Yelp say that Bouchon is the best duck.</p>
<p>So the question is like, is GPT held to that standard</p>
<p>or is it- Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Or something different?</p>
<p>And is linking to it enough?</p>
<p>This is the question that I&rsquo;m asking.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It should be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll argue it should be</p>
<p>because if you look at the four-part test for fair use,</p>
<p>which I had to go through</p>
<p>because blogging had the same issue.</p>
<p>We would write a blog post</p>
<p>and we would mention Walt Mossberg&rsquo;s review of a product</p>
<p>and somebody else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And then people would say,</p>
<p>oh, I don&rsquo;t need to read Walt Mossberg&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Indiana Wall Street Journal subscription.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;d say, well, we&rsquo;re doing an original work.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re comparing two or three different,</p>
<p>you know, human is comparing two or three different reviews</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re adding something to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, you know, it&rsquo;s not a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not interfering with Walt Mossberg&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to get subscribers in the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>But the effect on the potential market</p>
<p>is one of the four tests.</p>
<p>And just reading from Stanford&rsquo;s quote on fair use,</p>
<p>another important fair use factor</p>
<p>is whether your use deprives the copyright owner of income</p>
<p>or undermines a newer potential market</p>
<p>for the copyrighted work.</p>
<p>Depriving a copyright owner of income</p>
<p>is very likely to trigger a lawsuit.</p>
<p>This is true even if you are not competing directly</p>
<p>with the original work.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll put the link to Stanford here.</p>
<p>This is the key issue.</p>
<p>And I would not use Yelp.</p>
<p>In this example, I would not open the Yelp app.</p>
<p>Yelp would get no commerce and Yelp would lose this.</p>
<p>So ChatGPT and all these services must use citations</p>
<p>of where they got the original work.</p>
<p>They must link to them and they must get permission.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where this is all going to shake out.</p>
<p>And I believe that&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Well, forget about permission.</p>
<p>I mean, you can&rsquo;t get a big enough data set</p>
<p>if you have to get permission in advance, right?</p>
<p>You have to go out and negotiate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be the large data sets.</p>
<p>Quora, Yelp, the App Store reviews, Amazon&rsquo;s reviews.</p>
<p>So there are large corpuses of data that you would need.</p>
<p>Like Craigslist has famously never allowed anybody</p>
<p>to scrape Craigslist.</p>
<p>The amount of data inside Craigslist,</p>
<p>but one example of a data set,</p>
<p>would be extraordinary to build ChatGPT on.</p>
<p>ChatGPT is not allowed to,</p>
<p>because as you brought up robots.txt last week,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to need to be an AI.txt.</p>
<p>Are you allowed to use my data set in AI and under,</p>
<p>and how will I be compensated for it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll allow you to use Craigslist,</p>
<p>but you have to link to the original post</p>
<p>and you have to note that.</p>
<p>The other gray area that isn&rsquo;t there today,</p>
<p>but may emerge is when section 230 gets rewritten.</p>
<p>Because if they take the protections away</p>
<p>for the Facebook and the Googles of the world,</p>
<p>for the basically for being an algorithmic publisher</p>
<p>and saying an algorithm is equivalent to a publisher.</p>
<p>What it essentially saying is that an algorithm</p>
<p>is kind of like doing the work of a human</p>
<p>in a certain context.</p>
<p>And I wonder whether that&rsquo;s also an angle here,</p>
<p>which now this algorithm, which today,</p>
<p>David, you said the example,</p>
<p>I read all these blog posts, I write something.</p>
<p>But if an algorithm does it, maybe can you then say,</p>
<p>no, actually there was intent there that&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>than if a human were to do it.</p>
<p>My point is very complicated issues</p>
<p>that are going to get sorted out.</p>
<p>And I think the problem with the hype cycle</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re going to have to marry it</p>
<p>with an economic model for VCs to really make money.</p>
<p>And right now there&rsquo;s just too much betting on the come.</p>
<p>So to the extent you&rsquo;re going to invest,</p>
<p>it makes sense that you put money into open AI</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s safe.</p>
<p>Because the economic model of how you make money</p>
<p>for everybody else is so unclear.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s clear, actually, I have it for business.</p>
<p>I just signed up for ChatGPT Premium.</p>
<p>They had a survey that they shared on their Discord server</p>
<p>and I filled out the survey</p>
<p>and they did a price discovery survey, Friedberg.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the least you would pay, the most you would pay,</p>
<p>what would be too cheap of a price for ChatGPT Pro</p>
<p>and what would be too high of a price?</p>
<p>I put in like 50 bucks a month would be what I would pay.</p>
<p>But I was just thinking, imagine ChatGPT allowed you,</p>
<p>Friedberg, to have a Slack channel called Research</p>
<p>and you could go in there or anytime you&rsquo;re in Slack,</p>
<p>you do slash chat or slash ChatGPT</p>
<p>and you say slash ChatGPT tell me,</p>
<p>you know, what are the venues available in,</p>
<p>which we did this actually for,</p>
<p>I did this for Venues for a Long Summer.</p>
<p>I can say, what are the venues</p>
<p>that seat over 3000 people in Vegas?</p>
<p>And it just gave us the answer.</p>
<p>Okay, well, that was the job of the local event planner.</p>
<p>They had that list.</p>
<p>Now you can pull that list</p>
<p>from a bunch of different sources.</p>
<p>What would you pay for that?</p>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>Well, I think one of the big things that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>is all the old business models don&rsquo;t make sense anymore</p>
<p>in a world where the software is no longer</p>
<p>just doing what it&rsquo;s done for the last 60 years,</p>
<p>which is what is historically defined</p>
<p>as information retrieval.</p>
<p>So you have this kind of hierarchical storage of data</p>
<p>that you have some index against</p>
<p>and then you go and you search and you pull data out</p>
<p>and then you present that data back to the customer</p>
<p>or the user of the software.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s effectively been how all kind of data</p>
<p>has been utilized in all systems</p>
<p>for the past 60 years in computing.</p>
<p>Largely, what we&rsquo;ve really done</p>
<p>is kind of built an evolution of application layers</p>
<p>or software tools to interface with the fetching</p>
<p>of that data, the retrieval of that data</p>
<p>and the display of that data.</p>
<p>But what these systems are now doing,</p>
<p>what AI type systems or machine learning systems now do</p>
<p>is the synthesis of that data</p>
<p>and the representation of some synthesis of that data</p>
<p>to you the user in a way that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>look anything like the original data</p>
<p>that was used to make that synthesis.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where business models like a Yelp, for example,</p>
<p>or like a web crawler that crawls the web</p>
<p>and then presents webpage directories to you.</p>
<p>Those sorts of models no longer make sense</p>
<p>in a world where the software,</p>
<p>the signal to noise is now greater.</p>
<p>The signal is greater than the noise</p>
<p>and being able to present to you a synthesis of that data</p>
<p>and basically resolve what your objective is</p>
<p>with your own consumption and interpretation of that data,</p>
<p>which is how you&rsquo;ve historically used these systems.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s where there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>going back to the question of the hype cycle,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s about being a hype cycle.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s about the investment opportunity</p>
<p>against fundamentally rewriting all compute tools.</p>
<p>Because if all compute tools ultimately can use</p>
<p>this capability in their interface and in their modeling,</p>
<p>then it very much changes everything.</p>
<p>And one of the advantages that I think</p>
<p>businesses are gonna latch onto,</p>
<p>which we talked about historically,</p>
<p>is novelty in their data in being able to build new systems</p>
<p>and new models that aren&rsquo;t generally available.</p>
<p>Example?</p>
<p>In biotech and pharma, for example,</p>
<p>having screening results from very expensive experiments,</p>
<p>and running lots of experiments,</p>
<p>and having a lot of data against those experiments,</p>
<p>gives a company an advantage</p>
<p>in being able to do things like drug discovery,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna talk about that in a minute,</p>
<p>versus everyone using publicly known screening libraries</p>
<p>or publicly available protein modeling libraries,</p>
<p>and then screening against those,</p>
<p>and then everyone&rsquo;s got the same candidates</p>
<p>and the same targets and the same clinical objectives</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re gonna try and resolve from that output.</p>
<p>So I think novelty in data</p>
<p>is one way that advantage kind of arises.</p>
<p>But really, that&rsquo;s just kind of, where&rsquo;s there an edge?</p>
<p>But fundamentally, every business model can</p>
<p>and will need to be rewritten</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s dependent on the historical,</p>
<p>on the legacy of kind of information retrieval</p>
<p>as the core of what computing is used to do.</p>
<p>Saks, on my other podcast,</p>
<p>I was having a discussion with Molly</p>
<p>about the legal profession.</p>
<p>What impact would it be if ChantGPT took every court case,</p>
<p>every argument, every document,</p>
<p>and somebody took all of those legal cases</p>
<p>on the legal profession,</p>
<p>and then the filing of a lawsuit,</p>
<p>the defending of a lawsuit,</p>
<p>public defenders, prosecutors,</p>
<p>but what data could you figure out?</p>
<p>Like, just to think of the recent history,</p>
<p>look at Chesa Boudin.</p>
<p>You could literally take every case,</p>
<p>every argument he did, put it through it,</p>
<p>and say, you know, versus an outcome in another state,</p>
<p>and you could figure out what&rsquo;s actually going on</p>
<p>with this technology.</p>
<p>What impact did this have on the legal field?</p>
<p>You are a non-practicing attorney.</p>
<p>You have a legal degree.</p>
<p>I never practiced, other than one summer at a law firm.</p>
<p>But no, I think-</p>
<p>Did you pass the bar?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>I did pass the bar.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>First try.</p>
<p>Yes, of course.</p>
<p>First try?</p>
<p>Of course, yeah, come on, man.</p>
<p>You gotta be kind of dumb to fail the bar exam.</p>
<p>Look at Saks rolling his eyes.</p>
<p>Yes, I went to Stanford, dude.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m rated 1800.</p>
<p>It took two days of studying, come on.</p>
<p>I may not have passed the bar, but I know a little shit,</p>
<p>enough to know that you can&rsquo;t legally-</p>
<p>No, look, I would be curious in terms of-</p>
<p>Coach a lot?</p>
<p>A very common question</p>
<p>that an associate at a law firm would get asked</p>
<p>would be something like, you know,</p>
<p>summarize the legal precedence in favor of X, right?</p>
<p>And that, you could imagine GPT doing that, like, instantly.</p>
<p>Now, I think that the question about that,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s two questions.</p>
<p>One is, can you prompt GPT in the right way</p>
<p>to get the answer you want?</p>
<p>And I think, you know, Chamath,</p>
<p>you shared a really interesting video</p>
<p>showing that people are developing some skills</p>
<p>around knowing how to ask GPT questions in the right way.</p>
<p>Exact prompt engineering.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because GPT is a command line interface.</p>
<p>So, if you ask GPT a simple question</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s the best restaurant in, you know, Napa,</p>
<p>it knows how to answer that.</p>
<p>But there are much more complicated questions</p>
<p>that you kind of need to know</p>
<p>how to prompt it in the right way.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s not clear to me that a command line interface</p>
<p>is the best way of doing that.</p>
<p>I could imagine apps developing</p>
<p>that create more of like a GUI.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;re an investor, for example, in Copy AI,</p>
<p>which is doing this for copywriters and marketers,</p>
<p>helping them write blog posts and emails.</p>
<p>And so, you know, imagine putting that, like, you know,</p>
<p>GUI on top of Chad GPT.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve already been kind of doing this.</p>
<p>So, I think that&rsquo;s part of it.</p>
<p>I think the other part of it is on the answer side,</p>
<p>you know, how accurate is it?</p>
<p>Because in some professions,</p>
<p>having 90 or 95 or 99% accuracy is okay.</p>
<p>But in other professions, you need six nines accuracy,</p>
<p>meaning 99.9999% accuracy, okay?</p>
<p>So, I think for a lawyer going into court,</p>
<p>you know, you probably need, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, it depends on the brief, on the question.</p>
<p>Versus a murder trial is two very different things.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So, is 99% accuracy good enough?</p>
<p>Is 95% accuracy good enough?</p>
<p>I would say probably for a court case,</p>
<p>95% is probably not good enough.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure GPT&rsquo;s at even 95% yet.</p>
<p>But could it be helpful?</p>
<p>Like, could the associates start with Chad GPT,</p>
<p>get an answer, and then validate it?</p>
<p>Probably, yeah.</p>
<p>If you had a bunch of associates</p>
<p>bang on some law model for a year,</p>
<p>again, that&rsquo;s that reinforcement learning</p>
<p>we just talked about.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d get precision recall off the charts,</p>
<p>and it would be perfect.</p>
<p>By the way, just a cute thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys got this email.</p>
<p>It came about an hour ago from Reid Hoffman.</p>
<p>And Reid said to me,</p>
<p>Hey, Chamath, I created Fireside Chatbots,</p>
<p>a special podcast miniseries</p>
<p>where I will be having a set of conversations</p>
<p>with Chad GPT.</p>
<p>So, you can go to YouTube, by the way,</p>
<p>and see Reid having,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a very smart guy,</p>
<p>so this should be kind of cool.</p>
<p>And by the way, Chad GPT will have an AI-generated voice</p>
<p>powered by the text-to-speech platform Play.ht.</p>
<p>Go to YouTube if you want to see Reid</p>
<p>have a conversation with Chad GPT.</p>
<p>I mean, Chamath, we have a conversation</p>
<p>with the two Davids every week.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
<p>We know how this is going to turn out.</p>
<p>Hey, but actually, so synthesizing Chamath&rsquo;s point</p>
<p>about reinforcement learning</p>
<p>with something you said, Jkal, in our chat,</p>
<p>which I actually thought was pretty smart.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a first.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;m going to give you credit here</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve said it on this episode,</p>
<p>which is you said that these open AI capabilities</p>
<p>are eventually going to become commoditized</p>
<p>or certainly much more widely available.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that means</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ll be totally commoditized</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;ll be four players,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;ll be multiple players that offer them.</p>
<p>And you said the real advantage will come from</p>
<p>applications that are able to get ahold</p>
<p>of proprietary data sets</p>
<p>and then use those proprietary data sets</p>
<p>to generate insights.</p>
<p>And then layering on what Chamath said</p>
<p>about reinforcement learning,</p>
<p>if you can be the first out there</p>
<p>in a given vertical with a proprietary data set,</p>
<p>and then you get the advantage,</p>
<p>the moat of reinforcement learning,</p>
<p>that would be the way to create,</p>
<p>I think, a sustainable business.</p>
<p>Just to build on what you said,</p>
<p>this week is the JP Morgan conference.</p>
<p>Freeberg mentioned it last week.</p>
<p>I had dinner on Wednesday</p>
<p>with this really interesting company based in Zurich.</p>
<p>And what they have is basically a library of ligands, right?</p>
<p>And so these ligands are used as a substrate</p>
<p>to deliver all kinds of molecules inside the body.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting is that they have a portfolio</p>
<p>of like a thousand of these,</p>
<p>but really what they have</p>
<p>is they have all the nuclear medicine</p>
<p>about whether it works.</p>
<p>They target glioblastoma, glioblastoma.</p>
<p>And so all of a sudden they can say,</p>
<p>well, this ligand can actually cross the blood-brain barrier</p>
<p>and get to the brain.</p>
<p>They have an entire data set of that</p>
<p>and a whole bunch of nuclear imagery around that.</p>
<p>They have something for soft cell carcinoma.</p>
<p>So then they have that data set.</p>
<p>So to your point, that&rsquo;s really valuable</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s real work that Google or Microsoft</p>
<p>or OpenAI won&rsquo;t do, right?</p>
<p>And if you have that and you bring it to the problem,</p>
<p>you can probably make money.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a business there to be built.</p>
<p>Just building on this conversation,</p>
<p>I just realized like a great prompt engineer</p>
<p>is gonna become a title and an actual skill,</p>
<p>the ability to interface with these AIs.</p>
<p>Here you go, coding school 2.0.</p>
<p>Well, no, a prompt engineer,</p>
<p>somebody who is very good at talking to these instances</p>
<p>and maximizing the result for them</p>
<p>and refining the results for them,</p>
<p>just like a detective who asks great questions,</p>
<p>that person is gonna be 10 or 20 times more valuable.</p>
<p>They could be the proverbial 10X engineer</p>
<p>in the future in a company.</p>
<p>And as we talk about austerity and doing more with less</p>
<p>and the 80% less people running Twitter now</p>
<p>or Amazon laying off 18,000 people,</p>
<p>Salesforce laying off 8,000,</p>
<p>Facebook laying off 10 and probably another 10,000,</p>
<p>what catalytic effect could this have?</p>
<p>We could be sitting here in three or four or five years</p>
<p>and instead of running a company like Twitter</p>
<p>with 80% less people,</p>
<p>maybe you could run it with 98% less people.</p>
<p>Look, I think directionally, it&rsquo;s the right statement.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve made the statement a number of times</p>
<p>that I think we move from this idea of creator economy</p>
<p>to narrator economy,</p>
<p>where historically it was kind of labor economy,</p>
<p>where humans use their physical labor to do things.</p>
<p>Then we were knowledge workers.</p>
<p>We used our brains to make things.</p>
<p>And then ultimately we kind of, I think,</p>
<p>resolve to this narrator economy</p>
<p>where the way that you kind of can state intention</p>
<p>and better manipulate the tools</p>
<p>to drive your intentional outcome,</p>
<p>the more successful you&rsquo;re gonna be.</p>
<p>And you can kind of think about this</p>
<p>as being the artist of the past.</p>
<p>Da Vinci was, what made him so good</p>
<p>was he was technically incredible</p>
<p>at trying to reproduce a photographic like imagery</p>
<p>using paint.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s these really great kind of museum exhibits</p>
<p>on how he did it using these really interesting</p>
<p>kind of like split mirror systems.</p>
<p>And then the artist of the 21st century,</p>
<p>the 20th century was the best user of Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>And that person is not necessarily the best painter.</p>
<p>And the artist of the 22nd century</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t gonna look like the Photoshop expert.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not gonna look like the painter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna look like something entirely different.</p>
<p>It could be who&rsquo;s got the most creative imagination</p>
<p>in driving the software to drive new outcomes.</p>
<p>And I think that the same analogy</p>
<p>can be used across every market and every industry.</p>
<p>However, one thing to note, Jekyll,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not about austerity</p>
<p>because the Luddite argument is</p>
<p>when you have new tools</p>
<p>and you get more leverage from those tools,</p>
<p>you have less work for people to do</p>
<p>and therefore everyone suffers.</p>
<p>The reality is new work emerges</p>
<p>and new opportunities emerge</p>
<p>and we level up as a species.</p>
<p>And when we level up,</p>
<p>we all kind of fill the gaps</p>
<p>and expand our productivity and our capability set.</p>
<p>I thought what Jekyll was saying was more that</p>
<p>Google will be smaller,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t mean that the pie wouldn&rsquo;t grow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that that individual company is run differently,</p>
<p>but there will be hundreds of more companies</p>
<p>or thousands more, millions more.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s sort of,</p>
<p>I have an actual punch up for you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Instead of narrative, it&rsquo;s the conductor economy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re conducting a symphony.</p>
<p>Ooh, a punch up.</p>
<p>Punch up there.</p>
<p>But I do think like we&rsquo;re gonna,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be somebody who&rsquo;s sitting there like,</p>
<p>remember Tom Cruise in Minority Report as a detective</p>
<p>was moving stuff around with a interface,</p>
<p>with the gloves and everything.</p>
<p>This is kind of that manifested.</p>
<p>You could, even if you&rsquo;re not an attorney,</p>
<p>you could say,</p>
<p>hey, I wanna sue this company for copyright infringement.</p>
<p>Give me my best arguments.</p>
<p>And then on the other side say,</p>
<p>hey, I wanna know what the next three features</p>
<p>I should put into my product is.</p>
<p>Can you examine who are my top 20 competitors?</p>
<p>And then who have they hired in the last six months?</p>
<p>And what are those people talking about on Twitter?</p>
<p>You can have this conductor,</p>
<p>you know, who becomes really good at that.</p>
<p>Well, the leveling up,</p>
<p>massive amounts of tasks.</p>
<p>Yeah, the leveling up that happens</p>
<p>in the book Ender&rsquo;s Game,</p>
<p>I think is a good example of this</p>
<p>where the guy goes through the entire kind of ground up.</p>
<p>And then ultimately he&rsquo;s commanding armies</p>
<p>of spaceships in space.</p>
<p>And his orchestration of all of these armies</p>
<p>is actually the skillset that wins the war.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You predicted that there would be like all these people</p>
<p>that create these next gen forms of content.</p>
<p>But I think this Reid Hoffman thing could be pretty cool.</p>
<p>Like what if he wins a Grammy</p>
<p>for his computer created podcast miniseries?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>The thing I&rsquo;m really excited about,</p>
<p>when&rsquo;s the first AI novel gonna get published</p>
<p>by a major publisher?</p>
<p>I think it happens this year.</p>
<p>When&rsquo;s the first AI symphony gonna get performed</p>
<p>by a major symphony orchestra?</p>
<p>And when&rsquo;s the first AI generated screenplay</p>
<p>get turned into an AI generated 3D movie that we all watch?</p>
<p>And then the more exciting one I think</p>
<p>is when do we all get to make our own AI video game</p>
<p>where we instruct the video game platform</p>
<p>what world we wanna live in?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>for the next three or four years,</p>
<p>but when it does, I think everyone&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>these new immersive environments that they can live in.</p>
<p>I have a question.</p>
<p>When-</p>
<p>When I say live in, I mean video game wise.</p>
<p>Yeah, sorry, go ahead.</p>
<p>When you have these computer systems,</p>
<p>just like to use a question of game theory for a second,</p>
<p>these models are iterating rapidly.</p>
<p>These are all mathematical models.</p>
<p>So inherent in, let&rsquo;s just say the perfect answer, right?</p>
<p>Like if you had perfect precision recall,</p>
<p>if multiple models get there at a system-wide level,</p>
<p>everybody is sort of like,</p>
<p>they get to the game theory optimal.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all at Nash equilibrium, right?</p>
<p>All these systems working at the same time.</p>
<p>Then the real question would then be,</p>
<p>what the hell do you do then?</p>
<p>Because if you keep getting the same answer,</p>
<p>if everybody then knows how to ask the exact right question</p>
<p>and you start to go through these iterations</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like, maybe there is a dystopian hellscape</p>
<p>where there are no jobs.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s the Elon world,</p>
<p>which is you can recursively find a logical argument</p>
<p>where there is no job that&rsquo;s possible, right?</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m not saying that that path is the likely path,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m saying it is important to keep in mind</p>
<p>that that path of outcomes is still very important</p>
<p>to keep in the back of our mind</p>
<p>as we figure these things out.</p>
<p>Well, Freeberg, you know, you were asking before about this,</p>
<p>like, you know, will more work be created?</p>
<p>Of course, artistic pursuits,</p>
<p>podcasting is a job now, being an influencer is a job,</p>
<p>yada, yada, new things emerge in the world.</p>
<p>But here in the United States in 1970,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at Fred, I&rsquo;m looking at the St. Louis Fed,</p>
<p>1970, 26.4% of the country was working in a factory,</p>
<p>was working in manufacturing.</p>
<p>You want to guess what that is in 2012?</p>
<p>Sorry, what percentage?</p>
<p>It was 26% in 1970.</p>
<p>And in 2015, when they stopped the percentage</p>
<p>in manufacturing in the United States,</p>
<p>they discontinued this, it was a 10.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s possible we could just see, you know,</p>
<p>the concept of office work, the concept of knowledge work</p>
<p>is going to follow, pretty inevitable,</p>
<p>the path of manufacturing.</p>
<p>That seems like a pretty logical theory or no?</p>
<p>I think we should move on, but yes.</p>
<p>Okay, so how would we like to ruin the show now?</p>
<p>Should we talk about Biden and the documents</p>
<p>and ruin the show with political talk?</p>
<p>Or should we talk about,</p>
<p>since it&rsquo;s been such a great episode so far,</p>
<p>what do we want to talk about next?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a couple of choices.</p>
<p>Well, I know what you don&rsquo;t want to talk about.</p>
<p>You guys are talking about productivity.</p>
<p>Give it to him, give it to him, give it to him.</p>
<p>We all know, we all know,</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>We all know, J. Cal, that according to you,</p>
<p>when a president is in possession of classified documents</p>
<p>in his home that apparently have been taken</p>
<p>in an unauthorized manner, basically stolen,</p>
<p>he should have his home raided by the FBI.</p>
<p>Almost, close, close.</p>
<p>So anyway, Biden, as of the taping of this,</p>
<p>has now said there&rsquo;s a third batch of classified documents.</p>
<p>This group, I guess there was one at an office,</p>
<p>one at a library,</p>
<p>now this third group is in his garage with his Corvette.</p>
<p>Certainly not looking good and independent.</p>
<p>They say that in his defense,</p>
<p>they say the garage was locked,</p>
<p>meaning that you could use a garage door opener</p>
<p>to open and close it.</p>
<p>It was locked when it went closed.</p>
<p>So pretty much as secure as the documents at Mar-a-Lago,</p>
<p>same equivalency.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Actually, I mean, just to be perfectly fair,</p>
<p>the documents at Mar-a-Lago were locked in a basement.</p>
<p>The FBI came, checked it out,</p>
<p>said, we&rsquo;d like you to lock those up.</p>
<p>They locked them up.</p>
<p>A little safer than being in a garage with a Corvette,</p>
<p>but functionally the same.</p>
<p>Functionally the same.</p>
<p>The only difference here would be what,</p>
<p>Sachs, when you look at these two cases?</p>
<p>Well, that in one case,</p>
<p>Merrick Garland is appointed an independent counsel</p>
<p>to investigate Trump,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no such a special counsel</p>
<p>or investigator appointed to investigate Biden.</p>
<p>I mean, these things are functionally the same.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t he put somebody on it, though?</p>
<p>Wait, did he put somebody on it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ve appointed a special counsel yet.</p>
<p>No, they did.</p>
<p>As of an hour ago, a special counsel was appointed.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Did that just happen?</p>
<p>Yeah, one hour ago.</p>
<p>Robert Herr is his name.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I guess there are real questions to look into here.</p>
<p>The documents apparently were moved twice.</p>
<p>Why were they moved?</p>
<p>Who ordered that?</p>
<p>What was a classified document doing</p>
<p>in Biden&rsquo;s personal library?</p>
<p>What do the documents pertain to?</p>
<p>Do they touch on the Biden family&rsquo;s business dealings</p>
<p>in Ukraine and China?</p>
<p>So there are real things to look into here,</p>
<p>but let me just take a step back.</p>
<p>Now that the last three presidential candidates</p>
<p>have been ensnared in these classified document problems,</p>
<p>remember, it&rsquo;s Biden now, and then Trump,</p>
<p>and Hillary Clinton before Trump,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s time to step back and ask,</p>
<p>are we over-classifying documents?</p>
<p>I mean, are we fetishizing these documents?</p>
<p>Are they all really that sensitive?</p>
<p>It seems to me that we have an over-classification problem,</p>
<p>meaning that ever since FOIA was passed,</p>
<p>the Freedom of Information Act,</p>
<p>the government can avoid accountability and prying eyes</p>
<p>by simply labeling any document as classified.</p>
<p>So over-classification was a logical response</p>
<p>by the permanent government</p>
<p>to the Freedom of Information Act,</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s gotten to the point</p>
<p>where just about everything handed</p>
<p>to a president or vice president is classified.</p>
<p>So I think I can understand</p>
<p>why they&rsquo;re all making this mistake.</p>
<p>And I think a compounding problem</p>
<p>is that we never declassify anything.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still all these records</p>
<p>from the Kennedy assassination</p>
<p>that have never been declassified.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re supposed to have declassified these.</p>
<p>The CIA keeps filibustering</p>
<p>on the release of the JFK assassination documents,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve been told they have to stop</p>
<p>and they have to release them,</p>
<p>and then they keep redacting stuff</p>
<p>and not releasing them.</p>
<p>I hate to be a conspiracy theorist here,</p>
<p>but what are they trying to cover up?</p>
<p>I mean, this is a long time ago.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only way to interpret it.</p>
<p>But even for more mundane documents,</p>
<p>there are very few documents</p>
<p>that need to be classified after even, say, five years.</p>
<p>You could argue that we should be</p>
<p>automatically declassifying them after five years,</p>
<p>unless they go through a process to get reclassified.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;d say, just you guys in business,</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s not government, in business,</p>
<p>how many of the documents that you deal with</p>
<p>are still sensitive, are trade secrets, five years later?</p>
<p>I would say almost none of them.</p>
<p>Certainly 20 years later, they&rsquo;re not, right?</p>
<p>Like in almost all cases.</p>
<p>No, but I would even say like five years.</p>
<p>I mean, the only documents-</p>
<p>The Coca-Cola formula.</p>
<p>The only documents in business</p>
<p>that I think I deal with that you could call sensitive</p>
<p>are the ones that pertain to the company&rsquo;s future plans,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Because you wouldn&rsquo;t want a competitor-</p>
<p>Cap table.</p>
<p>To get those.</p>
<p>Yeah, cap table.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a handful of things, right?</p>
<p>Legal issues, yeah.</p>
<p>Even cap table is not that sensitive</p>
<p>because by the time you go public,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s legally has to be public.</p>
<p>Yeah, so at some point-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on Carta, like there&rsquo;s 100 people who have that.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So like in business, I think our experience has been</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s very few documents that stay sensitive,</p>
<p>that need to remain secret.</p>
<p>Now look, if Biden or Trump or whoever,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re reviewing the schematics</p>
<p>to the Javelin missile system or to, you know,</p>
<p>how we make our nuclear bombs or something,</p>
<p>obviously that needs to stay secret forever.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t believe our politicians</p>
<p>are reviewing those kinds of documents.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, we both-</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really understand what it is that they&rsquo;re reviewing-</p>
<p>Why are they keeping them-</p>
<p>That needs to be classified five years later.</p>
<p>And why are they keeping them</p>
<p>was the issue we discussed previously.</p>
<p>We actually agreed on that.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re just keeping mementos.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a simple explanation</p>
<p>for why they&rsquo;re keeping them, Jason,</p>
<p>which is that everything is more classified</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a zillion documents.</p>
<p>And if you look, like both Biden and Trump,</p>
<p>these documents were mixed in</p>
<p>with a bunch of personal effects and mementos.</p>
<p>My point is, if you work in government</p>
<p>and handle documents, they&rsquo;re all classified.</p>
<p>So I mean-</p>
<p>And if the National Archive asks for them back,</p>
<p>or you find them, you should just give them back.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s going to wind up being the rough years.</p>
<p>Trump didn&rsquo;t give them back and Biden did.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the only difference here really.</p>
<p>Well, no, no, no, hold on.</p>
<p>The FBI went to Trump&rsquo;s basement.</p>
<p>They looked around.</p>
<p>They said, put a lock on this.</p>
<p>They seemed to be okay with it initially.</p>
<p>Then maybe they changed their minds.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not defending Trump, but-</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s pretty clear that he wouldn&rsquo;t give them back in.</p>
<p>That was the issue.</p>
<p>The point I&rsquo;m making is that now that Biden, Trump,</p>
<p>and Hillary Clinton have all been ensnared in this,</p>
<p>is it time to rethink the fact</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re over-classifying so many documents?</p>
<p>I mean, just think about the incentives</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re creating for our politicians.</p>
<p>Okay, just think about the incentives.</p>
<p>Number one, never use email.</p>
<p>Remember Hillary Clinton and the whole email server?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You gotta be nuts to use email.</p>
<p>Number two, never touch a document.</p>
<p>Never touch a document.</p>
<p>Never let anyone hand you a document.</p>
<p>Flush them down the toilet.</p>
<p>Never let anyone hand you a document.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re a politician, an elected official,</p>
<p>the only time you should ever be handling anything</p>
<p>is go into a clean room, make an appointment,</p>
<p>go in there, read something, don&rsquo;t take notes,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t bring a camera, and then leave.</p>
<p>I mean, this is no way to run a government.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Who does this benefit?</p>
<p>Who does this benefit?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t benefit our elected officials.</p>
<p>It makes it almost impossible</p>
<p>for them to act like normal people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>It benefits the insiders, the permanent government.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re missing the most important part about the SACs.</p>
<p>This was, if you wanna go into conspiracy theories,</p>
<p>this was a setup.</p>
<p>Biden planted the documents</p>
<p>so that we could create the false equivalency</p>
<p>and start up Biden versus Trump 2024.</p>
<p>This ensures that now Trump has something</p>
<p>to fight with Biden about and this is gonna help Trump.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying, because they&rsquo;re both tainted,</p>
<p>equally tainted from the same source.</p>
<p>They are equally tainted now, but I-</p>
<p>It puts Trump in the new cycle.</p>
<p>No, I think it&rsquo;s the opposite.</p>
<p>I think Merrick Garland now is gonna have to drop</p>
<p>the prosecution against Trump for the stolen documents,</p>
<p>or at least that part of what they&rsquo;re investigating him for.</p>
<p>They might still investigate him</p>
<p>over January 6th or something.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t investigate Trump over documents now.</p>
<p>Those two seems more sticky, yeah.</p>
<p>I agree with that, actually.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna be hard to do.</p>
<p>But my point is, like, just think about, look,</p>
<p>both sides are engaged in hyper partisanship.</p>
<p>The way right now that the conservatives on the right,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re attacking Biden now for the same thing</p>
<p>that the left was attacking Trump for.</p>
<p>My point is, like, just take a step back</p>
<p>and again, think about the incentives we&rsquo;re creating</p>
<p>about how to run our government.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t use email and you can&rsquo;t touch documents.</p>
<p>And everything&rsquo;s an investigation</p>
<p>the second you get out of the office.</p>
<p>And by the way, don&rsquo;t ever go into politics</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a business person,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll investigate every deal you ever did</p>
<p>prior to getting into politics.</p>
<p>I mean, just think about the incentives we&rsquo;re creating.</p>
<p>So what are you gonna do when you try to get</p>
<p>your treasury position?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s gonna happen?</p>
<p>You gotta be nuts.</p>
<p>You gotta be nuts to go into government.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not gonna take a position</p>
<p>in DeSantis&rsquo; cabinet?</p>
<p>My point is that the Washington insiders,</p>
<p>by which I mean the permanent Washington establishment,</p>
<p>i.e. the deep state, they&rsquo;re creating a system</p>
<p>in which they&rsquo;re running things</p>
<p>and the elected officials barely can operate</p>
<p>like normal functioning humans there.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>I heard a great rumor.</p>
<p>This is total gossip mongering.</p>
<p>Oh, here we go.</p>
<p>That, you know, one of Ken Griffin&rsquo;s best out</p>
<p>is to get DeSantis elected</p>
<p>so that he can become treasury secretary.</p>
<p>I mean, Ken Griffin would get that if he wanted it.</p>
<p>And then he would be able to divest</p>
<p>all of Citadel tax-free.</p>
<p>So he would mark the market like $30 billion,</p>
<p>which is a genius way to go out.</p>
<p>Now, then it occurred to me, oh my God,</p>
<p>that is me and Sachs&rsquo; path too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love with a lot less money, but let&rsquo;s say path.</p>
<p>Wait, why would it be tax-free?</p>
<p>When you get appointed to those senior posts,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re allowed to either stick it in a blind trust</p>
<p>or you can sell with no capital gains.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Well, because they want you to divest anything that can.</p>
<p>Yes, anything that presents a conflict,</p>
<p>they want you to divest.</p>
<p>And so the argument is, if you&rsquo;re forced to divest it</p>
<p>to enter a government, you shouldn&rsquo;t be forcibly taxed.</p>
<p>Wait, if I become mayor of San Francisco or Austin,</p>
<p>I can enter a federal government.</p>
<p>When you become secretary of transportation,</p>
<p>J. Cal, you can do that.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m qualified for that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d take the bus.</p>
<p>I got an electric bike.</p>
<p>To answer Freebrook&rsquo;s point, I think Citadel securities,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of folks that would buy that</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s just a securities trading business.</p>
<p>And then Citadel, the hedge fund,</p>
<p>probably something like a big bulge bracket bank</p>
<p>or Blackstone.</p>
<p>Probably Blackstone, in fact,</p>
<p>because now Blackstone can plug it</p>
<p>into a trillion dollar asset machine.</p>
<p>I think there would be buyers out the door.</p>
<p>This is an incredible grift.</p>
<p>Now I know why Sachs-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a grift at all, but it&rsquo;s an incredible-</p>
<p>Oh, come on, man.</p>
<p>A cabinet position for no cap gains?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not a grift.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, those are the laws.</p>
<p>They force you to sell everything.</p>
<p>It feels grifty to me.</p>
<p>And then you do public service.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re misusing the word</p>
<p>to continue to genuflect to the left-leaning media.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not genuflecting.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re being a little defensive</p>
<p>because you see this as a bad-</p>
<p>Then that or you&rsquo;re dumb.</p>
<p>Pick one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not stupid, man.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t-</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even grift when I see it.</p>
<p>You take a cabinet position.</p>
<p>Sachs, would you take a cabinet position?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t pay cap gains?</p>
<p>Would you be secretary of the country?</p>
<p>Where does that exist?</p>
<p>Yeah, Sachs, if you were asked to serve-</p>
<p>Look, any normal person who wants to serve in government,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t use email and you can&rsquo;t touch a document</p>
<p>and every deal you&rsquo;ve ever done gets investigated.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a yes.</p>
<p>Why the hell would you want to do it?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a yes.</p>
<p>Why would you want to do it?</p>
<p>I mean, offsetting that, you get to divest tax-free.</p>
<p>Methink thou doth protesteth too much, David Sachs.</p>
<p>The fact that you two know this rule</p>
<p>and Freeberg and I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>No, I know it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a well-known-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the only person who doesn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>this rich people knowledge.</p>
<p>I looked up grift.</p>
<p>It means to engage- Everyone knows this.</p>
<p>It means that to engage in a petty or small-scale swindle.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think selling a $31 billion entity</p>
<p>to a combination of BlackRock and Blackstone</p>
<p>would be considered a petty small-scale swindle.</p>
<p>Did any of you guys watch the Madoff series on Netflix?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Was it good? No.</p>
<p>Oh my God, it is so depressing.</p>
<p>I gotta say, just that Madoff series,</p>
<p>there is no glimmer of light or hope or positivity</p>
<p>or recourse.</p>
<p>Everyone is a victim.</p>
<p>Everyone suffers.</p>
<p>It is just so dark. So gross.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t watch it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so depressing.</p>
<p>The Madoff one.</p>
<p>The Madoff one is so depressing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so awful.</p>
<p>Yeah, they all kill themselves and die.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s a victim.</p>
<p>One guy died of cancer.</p>
<p>Irving Picard.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize all this.</p>
<p>The trustee that went and got the money.</p>
<p>He went and got money back from these people</p>
<p>who were 80 years old and retired</p>
<p>and had spent that money decades ago.</p>
<p>And he sued them and took their homes away from them.</p>
<p>And no one, and they had no idea</p>
<p>that they were part of the scam.</p>
<p>No one won.</p>
<p>It was a brutal, awful whole thing, yeah.</p>
<p>By the way, that&rsquo;s going to be really interesting</p>
<p>as we enter this SBF trial, because that is the trial.</p>
<p>That is what happens if you got-</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the Southern District of New York</p>
<p>said that this case is becoming too big for them</p>
<p>because all the places that SBF sent money,</p>
<p>all those PACs and all those political donations,</p>
<p>they have to go and investigate where that money went</p>
<p>and see if they can get it back.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to open up an investigation</p>
<p>into each one of these campaign finance and election</p>
<p>kind of interfering actions that were taken.</p>
<p>ProPublica, sorry, ProPublica.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum,</p>
<p>I did watch this weekend, Triangle of Sadness.</p>
<p>Have you guys seen that?</p>
<p>I watched it too, it was great!</p>
<p>Oh my God, Triangle of Sadness is great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so dark.</p>
<p>To the Davids, listen, this is one of the,</p>
<p>I thought it was, it didn&rsquo;t pay off the way I thought,</p>
<p>but this is one of the best setups you&rsquo;ll see in a movie.</p>
<p>So basically it&rsquo;s a bunch of people on a luxury yacht.</p>
<p>So you have a bunch of rich people as the guests.</p>
<p>Then you have the staff that interacts with them.</p>
<p>And this is like mostly Caucasian.</p>
<p>And then in the bowels of the ship,</p>
<p>what you see are Asian and black workers</p>
<p>that support them, okay?</p>
<p>So in some ways,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit of a microcosm of the world.</p>
<p>Oh, I thought you were gonna say</p>
<p>a microcosm of something else.</p>
<p>And then what happens is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a shipwreck basically, right?</p>
<p>Oh, don&rsquo;t spoil it, come on.</p>
<p>Okay, and so, but no, but I&rsquo;ll just say it.</p>
<p>So the plot is you have this Caucasian patriarchy</p>
<p>that then gets flipped upside down</p>
<p>because after the shipwreck,</p>
<p>the only person who knows how to make a fire</p>
<p>and catch the fish is the Filipino woman</p>
<p>who was in charge of cleaning the toilets.</p>
<p>So she becomes in charge.</p>
<p>So now you flip to this immigrant matriarchy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty great meditation on class and survival.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty well done.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t end well, I thought.</p>
<p>I thought it could.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s hard to wrap that one up.</p>
<p>Well, you know what they say, boys.</p>
<p>Steal a little and they throw you in jail.</p>
<p>Steal a lot and they make you king.</p>
<p>Famous Bob Dylan quote.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>All right, well, it&rsquo;s been a great episode.</p>
<p>Great to see you besties.</p>
<p>Austerity menu tonight.</p>
<p>Chamath, what&rsquo;s on the austerity menu tonight?</p>
<p>What are we doing?</p>
<p>Salad, some tuna sandwiches.</p>
<p>No, I think Kirsten is doing,</p>
<p>I think durad.</p>
<p>Durad, yeah, that&rsquo;s, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good fish.</p>
<p>Jake and I once had a great durad in Venice.</p>
<p>In Venice.</p>
<p>In Venice.</p>
<p>The durad from Venice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the best meals we&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p>Am I right?</p>
<p>So good, I agree.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s done well, the durad kicks ass.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one way to cook a durad.</p>
<p>Do you know what that is?</p>
<p>You gotta, it&rsquo;s the way they did in Venice.</p>
<p>You gotta cook the whole fish.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, she&rsquo;s doing that.</p>
<p>And then after you cook the fish,</p>
<p>then you debone it and yeah, that&rsquo;s the way to do it.</p>
<p>That was back when Saxon and I</p>
<p>used to enjoy each other&rsquo;s company.</p>
<p>Before this podcast made us into mortal enemies.</p>
<p>Jake, I&rsquo;m a little disappointed</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t agree with my take on this document scandal.</p>
<p>Instead of dunking in a partisan way,</p>
<p>I tried to explain why it was a problem</p>
<p>of our whole political system.</p>
<p>I like your theory.</p>
<p>I think, you know, you keep making me defend Biden.</p>
<p>I think Biden&rsquo;s a grifter.</p>
<p>I told you these guys are grifting.</p>
<p>Just think you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>I just think your party grifts a little bit more.</p>
<p>But yeah, compare your grift.</p>
<p>Are we going to play Saturday after the wildcard game?</p>
<p>Are you guys interested in playing Saturday as well?</p>
<p>Cause I got the hall pass.</p>
<p>I can do a game on Saturday.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I have to check with my boss.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s going to the, are you guys all going?</p>
<p>Sax, are you going to come to play poker</p>
<p>at that live stream thing for the day, LA?</p>
<p>I doubt it, no.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t want to interact with humans.</p>
<p>That does not play well in confirmation hearings.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The last time I did one of those,</p>
<p>Alan Keating destroyed me on camera.</p>
<p>I like, I had like, I had two left feet</p>
<p>and every time he bluffed, I folded.</p>
<p>Every time he had the nuts, I called.</p>
<p>It was brutal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Now you do get shellacked, a shellacking,</p>
<p>a classic Sax shellacked.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an edge saving thing.</p>
<p>Is that what&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Preserving, okay.</p>
<p>No, it has to do with the cabinet positions.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t need to be seen recklessly gambling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bad look.</p>
<p>If you could pick any cabinet position, Sax,</p>
<p>which one would it be?</p>
<p>State.</p>
<p>Treasury.</p>
<p>State&rsquo;s a lot of travel.</p>
<p>State&rsquo;s a lot of travel.</p>
<p>You never stay at home.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re always on a plane.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s looking for.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that those like cabinet positions</p>
<p>are that important.</p>
<p>I mean, they run these giant bureaucracies</p>
<p>that again are permanent.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t fire anyone.</p>
<p>So if you can&rsquo;t fire a person,</p>
<p>do they really report to you?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, only ceremonial.</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s idea was like, put a bunch of hardline,</p>
<p>CEO type people in charge,</p>
<p>have them blow up these things</p>
<p>and make it more efficient.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t really work, did it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, you know why a CEO is actually in charge?</p>
<p>Like Elon, he walks in,</p>
<p>if he doesn&rsquo;t like what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll just fire you.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t fire anyone.</p>
<p>How do you manage them</p>
<p>when they don&rsquo;t have to listen to anything you say?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our whole government right now.</p>
<p>Our cabinet heads are figureheads</p>
<p>for these departments,</p>
<p>for these giant departments.</p>
<p>Is that a no?</p>
<p>Or is that a yes you&rsquo;d still take state?</p>
<p>Look at that.</p>
<p>I think I have another theory.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s going for the ambassadorship first.</p>
<p>What is the best ambassadorship?</p>
<p>Well, you can&rsquo;t divest everything with no cap.</p>
<p>Historically, you can tell which ambassadorship</p>
<p>is the best one based on how much they charge for it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not an issue for you.</p>
<p>I think London is the most expensive.</p>
<p>I think that one&rsquo;s 15 million.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 10 million for London, 10 to 15.</p>
<p>Yeah, 10, 15 million, yeah.</p>
<p>10, 15 million?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Sachs&rsquo; fourth least expensive home cost.</p>
<p>No, no, no, you have to spend that</p>
<p>every year to run it, Jason.</p>
<p>You only get-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nothing for him.</p>
<p>You could be the ambassador to Guinea</p>
<p>or the ambassador to the UK.</p>
<p>You get the same budget.</p>
<p>Actually, what&rsquo;s kind of funny is</p>
<p>I know two people who served as ambassadors under Trump</p>
<p>and it was really cheap to get those</p>
<p>because no one wanted to be part</p>
<p>of the Trump administration.</p>
<p>Oh, they were on fire sale, two for one.</p>
<p>They were on fire sale after because of Trump.</p>
<p>Who wants to be tainted?</p>
<p>But by the way, one of them,</p>
<p>and you can just bleep out the name,</p>
<p>was telling me it was the best thing</p>
<p>because he ended up selling.</p>
<p>They already dipped the all-time highs to take the job.</p>
<p>He was like, I got to get out of all of his stuff.</p>
<p>No, but listen, let me tell you, the ambassadorships,</p>
<p>it was a smart trade by those guys</p>
<p>because ambassador&rsquo;s a lifetime title.</p>
<p>So your ambassador, whatever,</p>
<p>no one remembers what president when you were ambassador.</p>
<p>No one cares.</p>
<p>So you are going for the ambassador.</p>
<p>So Steve, I think it&rsquo;s fair to say.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s going ambassadorship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not interested in ceremonial things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in making an impact.</p>
<p>The problem with all these positions,</p>
<p>I mean, being a cabinet official</p>
<p>is not much different than being an ambassador.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to enlist in the Navy?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What has a bigger impact?</p>
<p>Being on all in pod or being an ambassador?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s more influential?</p>
<p>Sax on the all in pod or beep as the ambassador of Sweden?</p>
<p>Being on all in pod actually.</p>
<p>All in pod is more impactful.</p>
<p>By the way, this is why I take issue</p>
<p>with your statement about the term mainstream media,</p>
<p>because I think you have become the mainstream media</p>
<p>more than most of the folks that-</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re independent media.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re independent media.</p>
<p>Trust me, it&rsquo;s independent.</p>
<p>This thing&rsquo;s hanging on by a thread.</p>
<p>And stop genuflecting.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s independent.</p>
<p>Who knows if this thing&rsquo;s going to last</p>
<p>another three episodes.</p>
<p>I just like saying the word genuflect.</p>
<p>You like genuflecting, I know.</p>
<p>That is the top word of 2023 so far for me.</p>
<p>Oh, is that, is somebody doing an analysis</p>
<p>with Chad Chappity of the words used here?</p>
<p>No, but Sax brought that word up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful word.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not used enough.</p>
<p>All right, everybody, we&rsquo;ll see you next time</p>
<p>on the all in podcast.</p>
<p>Comments are turned back on.</p>
<p>Have at it, you animals.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>Enjoy, bye-bye.</p>
<p>Love you, besties, bye.</p>
<p>‚ô™ I&rsquo;m going all in ‚ô™</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Saxon.</p>
<p>‚ô™ I&rsquo;m going all in ‚ô™</p>
<p>And instead, we open source it to the fans</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you, Wesley.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>‚ô™ I&rsquo;m going all in ‚ô™</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>I hope they&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my dog taking a notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>Sax.</p>
<p>Wait, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>My avatars will meet me at place.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room</p>
<p>and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension</p>
<p>that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>Let your, the, be.</p>
<p>Let your, be.</p>
<p>Let your, be.</p>
<p>Be.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are back.</p>
<p>‚ô™ I&rsquo;m going all in ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ I&rsquo;m going all in ‚ô™</p>
