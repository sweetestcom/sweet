i&amp;rsquo;ve done so many videos on how to lose weight i haven&amp;rsquo;t done a video on how to gain weight gain actual fat and i think it&amp;rsquo;s good sometimes reverse the flow because if you really know how to gain weight which a lot of people do then you can actually reverse this plan and actually help yourself lose weight now i stumbled on this uh this diet that just actually made me laugh it&amp;rsquo;s called the nibbling diet okay it was an actual diet the nibbling diet where you&amp;rsquo;re consuming 17 snacks per day this was written in 1978 and basically not only do you have three meals and two snacks but you have additional snacks in between the snacks so this is actually even worse than the six meals per day plan that some people are doing and it&amp;rsquo;s also similar to the snack all day diet i&amp;rsquo;m not kidding there&amp;rsquo;s an actual diet called the snack all day diet where you&amp;rsquo;re doing six snacks okay you&amp;rsquo;re roughly doing about 180 calories per snack your dinner is 300 calories but you can do trades you can trade a snack for another snack or you can trade two snacks for a dinner because we all know that this whole calorie counting thing absolutely doesn&amp;rsquo;t work we&amp;rsquo;ve tried it a million times it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work it&amp;rsquo;s outdated but some people keep trying over and over and over again so let me get back to the nibbling diet the whole strategy of this nibbling diet where you&amp;rsquo;re doing 17 snacks a day is this it makes you feel like you are in control because you&amp;rsquo;re you&amp;rsquo;re actually eating anytime you want so you&amp;rsquo;re in control right well actually it&amp;rsquo;s just the opposite you&amp;rsquo;re completely out of control what&amp;rsquo;s out of control is your hormones your hormones are so far out of whack that you are actually in the back seat and your hormones are driving the car and so this is just a disaster waiting to happen because every time you snack i don&amp;rsquo;t care what you snack on you&amp;rsquo;re going to just jack up insulin it&amp;rsquo;s going to come down up and down up and down and guess what insulin is the hormone that converts your food into fat insulin is a hormone that makes you hungry and insulin is triggered by eating as well as eating carbs as well as eating anything and so every time you eat you&amp;rsquo;re just jacking this thing up all day long 17 times right it&amp;rsquo;s a perfect plan to put on fat let&amp;rsquo;s say for example you&amp;rsquo;re auditioning for a movie and you have to gain some quick fat this would be the perfect diet to go on another rationale in this book is that animals eat all day long and they don&amp;rsquo;t get fat i guess he&amp;rsquo;s talking about a cow right well first of all cows are fat and they eat grass so maybe you should start eating grass you can graze it all day long and maybe that&amp;rsquo;ll help you but most animals don&amp;rsquo;t graze all day long they usually go for a period of time without eating so they&amp;rsquo;re really doing a lot of fasting a lot of intermittent fasting and of course the cow is constantly regurgitating and and this grass is going through these four stomachs and it&amp;rsquo;s fermenting completely different digestive system than humans now the other rationale that they use in this book is that you want to eat to prevent hunger okay because if you&amp;rsquo;re hungry you might overeat so if you&amp;rsquo;re snacking just a small amount then you&amp;rsquo;re going to be safe because you&amp;rsquo;re not going to overeat but the problem is you&amp;rsquo;re going to jack up insulin so everything you&amp;rsquo;re eating is being converted into fat so that is not a good uh strategy and then they talk about these snacks are going to prevent a a low blood sugar situation so thereby cutting down on your hunger i guarantee this the more snacking you do the more hungry you&amp;rsquo;re going to be in fact snacking and binging is going to completely prevent your ability to tap into fat okay so you only have a little bit of sugar supply it&amp;rsquo;s going to be tapped out and then you&amp;rsquo;re going to be hungry again you&amp;rsquo;re gonna put yourself in a serious situation where you&amp;rsquo;re gonna be fat and hungry and tired and then pre-diabetic and then diabetic so now that you know how to get fat let&amp;rsquo;s reverse this and implement the opposite strategy which is intermittent fasting don&amp;rsquo;t snack eat infrequently drop insulin now your body can tap into fat an average person has almost an unlimited amount of fat to use as fuel versus the amount of stored sugar that you would use it&amp;rsquo;s very very small so you want to be able to tap into almost an unlimited amount of fuel and that way you&amp;rsquo;re burning fat 24 7 you have no hunger your appetite is gone so you can lose weight much easier because you&amp;rsquo;re not gonna have the appetite you&amp;rsquo;re not gonna be hungry if you&amp;rsquo;re new to my channel i put the exact plan down below so just follow it and i promise you it will work hey before you go if you&amp;rsquo;re benefiting from any of my content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down

to lose weight i haven&rsquo;t done a video  </p><p>on how to gain weight gain actual fat and i think 
it&rsquo;s good sometimes reverse the flow because if  </p><p>you really know how to gain weight which a lot of 
people do then you can actually reverse this plan  </p><p>and actually help yourself lose weight now 
i stumbled on this uh this diet that just  </p><p>actually made me laugh it&rsquo;s called the 
nibbling diet okay it was an actual diet  </p><p>the nibbling diet where you&rsquo;re consuming 17 snacks 
per day this was written in 1978 and basically not  </p><p>only do you have three meals and two snacks but 
you have additional snacks in between the snacks  </p><p>so this is actually even worse than the six meals 
per day plan that some people are doing and it&rsquo;s  </p><p>also similar to the snack all day diet i&rsquo;m not 
kidding there&rsquo;s an actual diet called the snack  </p><p>all day diet where you&rsquo;re doing six snacks 
okay you&rsquo;re roughly doing about 180 calories  </p><p>per snack your dinner is 300 calories but you can 
do trades you can trade a snack for another snack  </p><p>or you can trade two snacks for a dinner because 
we all know that this whole calorie counting thing  </p><p>absolutely doesn&rsquo;t work we&rsquo;ve tried it a million 
times it doesn&rsquo;t work it&rsquo;s outdated but some  </p><p>people keep trying over and over and over again 
so let me get back to the nibbling diet the whole  </p><p>strategy of this nibbling diet where you&rsquo;re doing 
17 snacks a day is this it makes you feel like  </p><p>you are in control because you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re actually 
eating anytime you want so you&rsquo;re in control right  </p><p>well actually it&rsquo;s just the opposite you&rsquo;re 
completely out of control what&rsquo;s out of control  </p><p>is your hormones your hormones are so far out of 
whack that you are actually in the back seat and  </p><p>your hormones are driving the car and so this 
is just a disaster waiting to happen because  </p><p>every time you snack i don&rsquo;t care what you snack 
on you&rsquo;re going to just jack up insulin it&rsquo;s going  </p><p>to come down up and down up and down and guess 
what insulin is the hormone that converts your  </p><p>food into fat insulin is a hormone that makes 
you hungry and insulin is triggered by eating  </p><p>as well as eating carbs as well as eating anything 
and so every time you eat you&rsquo;re just jacking  </p><p>this thing up all day long 17 times right it&rsquo;s a 
perfect plan to put on fat let&rsquo;s say for example  </p><p>you&rsquo;re auditioning for a movie and you have to 
gain some quick fat this would be the perfect diet  </p><p>to go on another rationale in this book is that 
animals eat all day long and they don&rsquo;t get fat i  </p><p>guess he&rsquo;s talking about a cow right well first of 
all cows are fat and they eat grass so maybe you  </p><p>should start eating grass you can graze it all day 
long and maybe that&rsquo;ll help you but most animals  </p><p>don&rsquo;t graze all day long they usually go for a 
period of time without eating so they&rsquo;re really  </p><p>doing a lot of fasting a lot of intermittent 
fasting and of course the cow is constantly  </p><p>regurgitating and and this grass is going through 
these four stomachs and it&rsquo;s fermenting completely  </p><p>different digestive system than humans now the 
other rationale that they use in this book is that  </p><p>you want to eat to prevent hunger okay because 
if you&rsquo;re hungry you might overeat so if you&rsquo;re  </p><p>snacking just a small amount then you&rsquo;re going 
to be safe because you&rsquo;re not going to overeat  </p><p>but the problem is you&rsquo;re going to jack up insulin 
so everything you&rsquo;re eating is being converted  </p><p>into fat so that is not a good uh strategy and 
then they talk about these snacks are going to  </p><p>prevent a a low blood sugar situation so thereby 
cutting down on your hunger i guarantee this  </p><p>the more snacking you do the more hungry you&rsquo;re 
going to be in fact snacking and binging is going  </p><p>to completely prevent your ability to tap into fat 
okay so you only have a little bit of sugar supply  </p><p>it&rsquo;s going to be tapped out and then you&rsquo;re going 
to be hungry again you&rsquo;re gonna put yourself  </p><p>in a serious situation where you&rsquo;re gonna be 
fat and hungry and tired and then pre-diabetic  </p><p>and then diabetic so now that you know how 
to get fat let&rsquo;s reverse this and implement  </p><p>the opposite strategy which is intermittent 
fasting don&rsquo;t snack eat infrequently drop  </p><p>insulin now your body can tap into fat an average 
person has almost an unlimited amount of fat to  </p><p>use as fuel versus the amount of stored sugar that 
you would use it&rsquo;s very very small so you want to  </p><p>be able to tap into almost an unlimited amount of 
fuel and that way you&rsquo;re burning fat 24 7 you have  </p><p>no hunger your appetite is gone so you can lose 
weight much easier because you&rsquo;re not gonna have  </p><p>the appetite you&rsquo;re not gonna be hungry if you&rsquo;re 
new to my channel i put the exact plan down below  </p><p>so just follow it and i promise you it will work 
hey before you go if you&rsquo;re benefiting from any of  </p><p>my content i would love to hear about your success
