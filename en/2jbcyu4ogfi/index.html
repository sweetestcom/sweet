<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>
<p>Ôªøhey everyone I have a great interview</p>
<p>for you this is Amit and you&rsquo;re were you</p>
<p>from right now were you located</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m located in Bangalore which is in</p>
<p>India awesome so I wanted to talk to you</p>
<p>because you sent me your before and</p>
<p>after picture it was quite incredible</p>
<p>and I wanted to find out a little bit</p>
<p>about your story can you tell me a</p>
<p>little bit about where you were before</p>
<p>and then what happened to turn around</p>
<p>before you lost the way yeah definitely</p>
<p>so in my early teen age I was pretty</p>
<p>good and then I was slim but when I</p>
<p>started my college is that when I got</p>
<p>lot of fat so it was like eating all day</p>
<p>out junk food I was not kidding about</p>
<p>what I am eating exactly it was whatever</p>
<p>I get most it was fast food and</p>
<p>restoring food so it started in college</p>
<p>time when I was like at the 19 or 20</p>
<p>years of old I got a lot of weight my</p>
<p>weight was around 89 is 92 aswell 92 kg</p>
<p>okay so 92 case how many pounds is that</p>
<p>I think it is around 200 okay Wow yeah I</p>
<p>remember in college we ain&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>really healthy no I&rsquo;m being sarcastic</p>
<p>now it was like we had deep fried night</p>
<p>Hormel chili oh my gosh I can&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>I actually survived on that we&rsquo;ve go to</p>
<p>the we were so poor we went to these</p>
<p>these stores that you had these</p>
<p>discounted canned food and buy canned</p>
<p>meat and I&rsquo;m like what the heck am I</p>
<p>doing with spam and it was bad bad so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that was the start of my thing</p>
<p>too so so you gained all this weight and</p>
<p>then and then what happened so it was</p>
<p>then a time came and I started feeling</p>
<p>unhealthy I did my health checkup but I</p>
<p>found so many issues I had a fatty liver</p>
<p>that was the first symptom how old were</p>
<p>you when you found you had a fatty liver</p>
<p>I was at the age of 23</p>
<p>is amazing yeah did you at school - yes</p>
<p>Wow</p>
<p>so that was scary for me he doctor told</p>
<p>me that I have a fatty liver and he told</p>
<p>me that you have to exercise you have to</p>
<p>stop eating outside food but then I</p>
<p>asked him he what kind of food should I</p>
<p>eat so he said stop outside food stop a</p>
<p>stolen food and start eating healthy</p>
<p>food like brown rice and grains healthy</p>
<p>grains and so on</p>
<p>which really didn&rsquo;t help me so taking</p>
<p>his feedback I joined the gym I joined</p>
<p>goals then I met a nutritionist she was</p>
<p>a dietician I took her advice she gave</p>
<p>me a meal plan that plan was again seven</p>
<p>meals per day starting from a breakfast</p>
<p>then every to wash they asked me to eat</p>
<p>so initially I lost around 4 to 5 kgs of</p>
<p>great I think that was all water went</p>
<p>all I stopped eating restoring food that</p>
<p>caused me to lose some weight but I was</p>
<p>still around 85 86 for around eight to</p>
<p>seven to eight years and it is recently</p>
<p>within a year when I started following</p>
<p>you I actually got my results down and</p>
<p>most of it is in last 3-4 months when I</p>
<p>actually started going through your</p>
<p>videos and following your guidance</p>
<p>religiously and you search like an</p>
<p>example when you get up in the morning</p>
<p>when&rsquo;s the first time you eat so I work</p>
<p>in I work for us business but I am in</p>
<p>India so I work in night shift so my</p>
<p>work starts at 7:30 p.m. ist which is 9</p>
<p>a round 9 a.m. est basically so what I</p>
<p>do is I get up around 2:00 p.m. every</p>
<p>day India time all right and then I work</p>
<p>out at 5:00 p.m. 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. ist</p>
<p>time and today I start my work so I fast</p>
<p>for nearly 60</p>
<p>our minimum and before finishing my fast</p>
<p>I workout as advised by you the best</p>
<p>time to do a workout so it also helps me</p>
<p>to get into so now like like few days</p>
<p>back I shared my report with you I was</p>
<p>out of ketosis so what had happened is</p>
<p>my wife was not in town so I was eating</p>
<p>a stolen food and considering the labels</p>
<p>that I had on KFC I tried it but it</p>
<p>kicked me out of the ketosis that was</p>
<p>for sure but I got high CRP levels yes</p>
<p>see we are she reacted protein as an</p>
<p>inflammatory indicator yeah yes and at</p>
<p>the same time you released a video on</p>
<p>CRP so I was not looking at that report</p>
<p>until I saw your video that I have to</p>
<p>look at those indicators so yeah then as</p>
<p>you told me you gave me advice that it</p>
<p>is high in MSG which will have</p>
<p>inflammation in your body so I stopped</p>
<p>it and I fall I got back to the eating</p>
<p>habits that you have told me and today I</p>
<p>did my test and I am back into ketosis</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>and like in in India I just talked to</p>
<p>someone in Pakistan and India just just</p>
<p>this morning and both of them said that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a fair amount of starch in India</p>
<p>they give a lot of starches grains rice</p>
<p>right II our that&rsquo;s exactly that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s absolutely right</p>
<p>yes a diabetes and thyroid I mean if you</p>
<p>see in my family I have my cousin</p>
<p>brothers and all who think they are</p>
<p>eating critically they go to gym they do</p>
<p>all exercise that they should do but</p>
<p>still they have thyroid there are two</p>
<p>three exams with such examples in my</p>
<p>family itself who has high roid and then</p>
<p>there are one or two my uncle&rsquo;s who also</p>
<p>have got diabetes Wow so this is my</p>
<p>family itself so I can understand how it</p>
<p>would be and if</p>
<p>where I work there we I work for</p>
<p>Microsoft so in there also we have a few</p>
<p>of my colleagues who have been who have</p>
<p>tyroid and issues with diabetes terrible</p>
<p>and then so give me an example of what</p>
<p>you would eat as your first meal</p>
<p>so my first means is after approximately</p>
<p>five to six hours after I wake up</p>
<p>so after getting up I workout before</p>
<p>ending my fast once I am done with my</p>
<p>workout I wait for another one hour or</p>
<p>so and then I eat my first meal so first</p>
<p>meal would be I include around 500 grams</p>
<p>of mixed vegetables so that would be</p>
<p>christoforous vegetables like broccoli</p>
<p>bell peppers and so on so mix I cook it</p>
<p>in coconut oil as suggested by you so</p>
<p>that is my first meal along with that I</p>
<p>have three ounces of chicken boiled or</p>
<p>sorted and and then I dress it with the</p>
<p>geese that is grass-fed butter that is</p>
<p>my first meal I generally try to keep</p>
<p>one meal only but in case if there are a</p>
<p>day or two in a week where I do two</p>
<p>meals then second meal would be a</p>
<p>smaller meal where I have a whole X 4 to</p>
<p>5 volts and a cheese basically so cheese</p>
<p>has been my partner and after I started</p>
<p>watching your videos on earlier I was</p>
<p>thinking like Jesus is dangerous for</p>
<p>health but then I look looked at my</p>
<p>report the cholesterol has been a 50%</p>
<p>reduction in the cholesterol after</p>
<p>eating the e and you&rsquo;re not even from</p>
<p>Wisconsin that&rsquo;s amazing Wisconsin was</p>
<p>they have a lot of cheese there so yes</p>
<p>some people are allergic to lactose</p>
<p>intolerance but I suggest try it cheese</p>
<p>is the higher protein and has good fats</p>
<p>question I have</p>
<p>the quality of food in where you are</p>
<p>from cheese and things I do they use</p>
<p>like hormones do they use a lot of</p>
<p>pesticides like America so uh yeah I</p>
<p>mean we have a branch which are</p>
<p>pasteurized but what I do is a your days</p>
<p>are so I know a farmer who gives me milk</p>
<p>so I generally take it from him and then</p>
<p>my wife makes use at home oh that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fantastic</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m jealous that is awesome that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really healthy and then um so you so did</p>
<p>you find that do you go from three meals</p>
<p>to two meals to one meal or how fast did</p>
<p>you go to the one meal a day so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been like initially when I started I if</p>
<p>it was difficult because I always had</p>
<p>cravings for carbs with the sugar but</p>
<p>then after understanding how exactly</p>
<p>body works obviously from your videos</p>
<p>your guidance I started pushing myself</p>
<p>then I came to three meals from three</p>
<p>meals after three weeks I entered into</p>
<p>two meals then I continued to mix for</p>
<p>twelve weeks and now I&rsquo;m doing one deal</p>
<p>of one meal a day</p>
<p>Wow and do you work out at all what you</p>
<p>do work out is it really intense or is</p>
<p>it a small workout</p>
<p>so uh again I was doing a rest-pause</p>
<p>training that is after I&rsquo;ve a said I</p>
<p>take a rest of two to three minutes but</p>
<p>then and I used to work out daily it was</p>
<p>not that effective since then I start</p>
<p>after falling your videos I started</p>
<p>doing high-intensity interval training</p>
<p>and that helps me a lot</p>
<p>to burn packs as I am doing workout on a</p>
<p>fasted state it helps me to get into</p>
<p>ketosis also a min last example</p>
<p>yesterday&rsquo;s example I was out of ketosis</p>
<p>for two days from last 3-4 days I am</p>
<p>eating a proper food but I was still not</p>
<p>into ketosis yesterday I went and I did</p>
<p>a high-intensity interval training for</p>
<p>45 minutes and today morning when I</p>
<p>checked I was into ketosis so that that</p>
<p>helps</p>
<p>out and then you are you finding that</p>
<p>your you&rsquo;re basically not as hungry as</p>
<p>you were before and you don&rsquo;t crave as</p>
<p>much not at all I mean it&rsquo;s like a I</p>
<p>have food but I don&rsquo;t feel like eating</p>
<p>but I eat because I have to get my daily</p>
<p>calories in yeah I&rsquo;m the same way I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like oh shoot I got to eat now I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>I guess like I guess see what happens</p>
<p>then you start eating and then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting hungry and like because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually raising the blood Sugar&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little bit so that drops and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>hungry it&rsquo;s like you probably would be</p>
<p>especially the people in the morning</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t be as hungry if they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t eat as soon as they eat now</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re hungry two hours later so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of like they&rsquo;re this it&rsquo;s a trap so</p>
<p>one of my colleague I was talking to him</p>
<p>so he has a diabetes so I asked him why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you do intermittent fasting so he</p>
<p>was like no my doctor has given me pills</p>
<p>I take them I feel better</p>
<p>so I I really collected one of your</p>
<p>video that it would be a sugar which</p>
<p>makes them feel better so I told him I</p>
<p>know a doctor who is very good in this</p>
<p>so three to four of my colleagues have</p>
<p>started actually falling you have seen</p>
<p>new subscriptions coming from them at</p>
<p>least on YouTube they have started</p>
<p>following you and two of my friends they</p>
<p>nearly lost three to four cages after</p>
<p>following your video Wow that&rsquo;s correct</p>
<p>but and one of them has also got into</p>
<p>ketosis so we when we did this medical</p>
<p>test it ketosis were detected in his</p>
<p>urine so yeah all advice that you have</p>
<p>given is helping us a lot that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great and for those people who</p>
<p>are new to this this video in this</p>
<p>concept I have a lot of other basic</p>
<p>videos you can watch on what to eat the</p>
<p>details there&rsquo;s a little real summary</p>
<p>book this my new book is not out yet if</p>
<p>the index is being done so it&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>month but I have a summary book it&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>my website is if you can probably get</p>
<p>through it in 20 minutes but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>this kind of like telling you here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what to eat exactly here&rsquo;s what to do</p>
<p>but that the two things that people tend</p>
<p>to be</p>
<p>concern with is oh I&rsquo;m eating all this</p>
<p>cholesterol I&rsquo;m going to get a heart</p>
<p>attack well no you&rsquo;re not your body</p>
<p>makes a lot of cholesterol 3,000</p>
<p>milligrams a day that&rsquo;s the equivalent</p>
<p>of a pound of butter a day 14 eggs or</p>
<p>300 strips of bacon so it&rsquo;s not your</p>
<p>body will basically make less when you</p>
<p>eat more and it&rsquo;s just like we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>brainwashed that cholesterol is bad but</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing is you got into</p>
<p>ketosis now you actually feel what it</p>
<p>feels like and I highly doubt that you</p>
<p>would ever go back to your old ways</p>
<p>because now you know the benefits and</p>
<p>you actually experienced it yes I would</p>
<p>definitely not go see I joined gold&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gym for event initially 4 to 5 5 6 years</p>
<p>back thinking that they are the one</p>
<p>octopus that I could look out for but</p>
<p>the advance that I got from them was to</p>
<p>eat 5 to 6 meals seven meals plan I mean</p>
<p>what kind of advice are they giving</p>
<p>which is actually not true I mean it</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t help me at all and it was it is</p>
<p>so difficult to follow that you have to</p>
<p>prepare those meals pack them take them</p>
<p>with you and all that I mean it is very</p>
<p>difficult in current life I mean how</p>
<p>would you do it that was one thing yeah</p>
<p>I mean like you&rsquo;re doing one meal a day</p>
<p>are you saving any money to a 1 mil a</p>
<p>day I think so definitely I&rsquo;m saving a</p>
<p>lot on the supplements as well so when I</p>
<p>started dreaming of the trainer in</p>
<p>Gold&rsquo;s Gym he told me that you will have</p>
<p>to take the BC SS you&rsquo;ll have to take</p>
<p>pre-workout you&rsquo;ll have to take interest</p>
<p>our you&rsquo;d have to take post-workout</p>
<p>and I used to buy all that but in India</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t get genuine supplements so I</p>
<p>used to import it from us every time so</p>
<p>it used to cost me around the you know</p>
<p>of four hundred three hundred four</p>
<p>hundred dollars to you know every month</p>
<p>for four supplements that I am saving</p>
<p>that every month I am not using any</p>
<p>supplement at all it is just it is just</p>
<p>and just old food that I&rsquo;m eating back</p>
<p>to one meal which which has helped me to</p>
<p>lose my weight I was a 200 lbs as I said</p>
<p>and in</p>
<p>last four to five months since I started</p>
<p>following you yes five to six months</p>
<p>when I started I was looking into your</p>
<p>videos from quite some time but I</p>
<p>actually started following them from</p>
<p>five months and now I wait around 154</p>
<p>LVS about that&rsquo;s great is your wife</p>
<p>following which is she doing the eating</p>
<p>plan yes so she she recently got</p>
<p>pregnant we got a big order baby and</p>
<p>then she was concerned about how to you</p>
<p>know lose weight because she had got out</p>
<p>of shape so she started falling</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and she also I mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the food that she cooks for me so</p>
<p>there has not been any issues with the</p>
<p>production of milk I mean she is able to</p>
<p>breastfeed the baby with the diet that</p>
<p>you have told us there is no side</p>
<p>effects at all my baby is also very good</p>
<p>so she is following it and here also</p>
<p>lost around five to six kids a kg in</p>
<p>last six weeks he is going to this slow</p>
<p>she is eating two meals two to three</p>
<p>meals but yeah she is falling</p>
<p>intermittent fasting that&rsquo;s awesome and</p>
<p>I think if a female is breastfeeding I</p>
<p>think two or three meals is which is</p>
<p>probably a little better just to make</p>
<p>sure you get everything all the</p>
<p>nutrients but the point is that if</p>
<p>someone has midsection weight they need</p>
<p>to do the ketosis and intermittent</p>
<p>fasting together because ketosis you can</p>
<p>still do six meals a day well that&rsquo;s to</p>
<p>screw that up and then the other thing</p>
<p>is that they want to if you have if you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get out of bed in the morning like</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you lost your vitality or your</p>
<p>energy and you get brain clogged you</p>
<p>just you just do this and it gets better</p>
<p>you get more focus ketosis was basically</p>
<p>for a peptic seizures so anything with</p>
<p>seizures or epilepsy you need to do this</p>
<p>because it actually feeds the brain so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of benefits that go way</p>
<p>beyond just wait</p>
<p>cognitive my skin is better I think you</p>
<p>might have said your skin&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>better right did you we the one that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in yet</p>
<p>I mean what has happened is so I go to</p>
<p>gym so I have the people who workout</p>
<p>with me they are working out from last</p>
<p>five to six years and they have a good</p>
<p>physique but then the way they saw my</p>
<p>transformation from last five to six</p>
<p>months now they are coming to seek</p>
<p>advice from me that happened actually</p>
<p>two of them very good body builders a</p>
<p>professional they are doing it from long</p>
<p>time they come and ask me now hey what</p>
<p>is your diet plan can you tell us I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying hard to lose a the fat but I am</p>
<p>not able to do it but I see that you</p>
<p>have done some magic that you have</p>
<p>drastically lost it in last five to six</p>
<p>months so what is exactly that you have</p>
<p>done so I told them that I am into</p>
<p>ketosis so they say is it good for your</p>
<p>body are you sure I said yeah it is I</p>
<p>mean I&rsquo;m doing it from five six months</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t seen a face any problem so</p>
<p>they were like one of my friend did it</p>
<p>and he got constipation so he had to go</p>
<p>to doctor to take medications to get out</p>
<p>of constipation I said you go to youtube</p>
<p>and follow dr. Burke he he is the one</p>
<p>who might follow and you will get good</p>
<p>results is what I have said told them</p>
<p>yeah yeah because you know you there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of different aspects you need to</p>
<p>know what to do you know if you get</p>
<p>constipation keto flu whatever there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>handling for everything because when you</p>
<p>switch yourselves over to this new</p>
<p>machine it actually requires a little</p>
<p>more of certain nutrients so you got to</p>
<p>understand the whole picture even the</p>
<p>dietitians that are critical of this</p>
<p>diet I know they don&rsquo;t even understand</p>
<p>it so when I explain it to someone I</p>
<p>before I tell them what to do I tell</p>
<p>them why it works right sure they really</p>
<p>get that data versus just blindly</p>
<p>following an eating planet they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand it conflicts with everything</p>
<p>else they&rsquo;ve done they might not do it</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why the videos are important</p>
<p>but yeah my whole thing is giving people</p>
<p>the truth on how to burn fat so they</p>
<p>have the tools now so it&rsquo;s not a matter</p>
<p>of believing someone</p>
<p>but experiencing it knowing it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>and then being them I have that tool if</p>
<p>you need to lose weight or you know if</p>
<p>you want to eat which you want that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fine but least you know how to undo it</p>
<p>if you mess up right so a keto has taken</p>
<p>a lot of you know attention nowadays but</p>
<p>there are many people who advise on</p>
<p>Tito&rsquo;s even I was you know if I go and</p>
<p>search on Google or YouTube to find</p>
<p>anything related to Kito&rsquo;s I will find</p>
<p>lot of videos but they are not that easy</p>
<p>to follow and what this is not actually</p>
<p>true unless I see what you tell us</p>
<p>I have followed that and have</p>
<p>experienced that and I have got the</p>
<p>results so I know that whatever you tell</p>
<p>is true and you go very detailed in</p>
<p>explaining what it exactly is others</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do that they will just read and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll reiterate it to us but the</p>
<p>videos that you have are very detailed I</p>
<p>have given it to my friends I have you</p>
<p>know referred my friends to subscribe to</p>
<p>your channels and they are also finding</p>
<p>it very useful</p>
<p>I remember one instance one is DC how do</p>
<p>you know the timings when to release the</p>
<p>videos you are at a point I mean I I did</p>
<p>my test and I found High Sierra P and</p>
<p>then you are releasing a video on</p>
<p>c-reactive protein the other day a</p>
<p>couple of months back my wife was</p>
<p>dealing with a after pregnancy effect</p>
<p>like you were getting hair fall she was</p>
<p>getting hair loss and then you will use</p>
<p>the video about why do you get the hair</p>
<p>loss for pregnancy and then she started</p>
<p>taking metal root so I have a secret</p>
<p>camera I&rsquo;m watching you and just saying</p>
<p>of problems you run into and quickly</p>
<p>create that video and then I release it</p>
<p>yeah I mean it makes you become as I</p>
<p>mean it makes you it makes us feel you</p>
<p>as a family doctor like you are looking</p>
<p>I mean yes you you have a something that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re observing us and then you are</p>
<p>helping us out on every situation</p>
<p>that is what is happening</p>
<p>and then you make us give that I read</p>
<p>most of the comments and we I have a lot</p>
<p>of comments on a lot of videos but I</p>
<p>just get feedback to see what people</p>
<p>want to know more about so that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>I get the ideas for the videos so yeah</p>
<p>so enough people are interested I&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>a video on that but but I&rsquo;ll you know</p>
<p>people say well how do you release two</p>
<p>videos a day how do you come up with the</p>
<p>material I mean one video alone could</p>
<p>take me ten hours of research I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking like five minutes of a video so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not just like throwing them out</p>
<p>there I&rsquo;m like really going through to</p>
<p>make sure that the data is correct and</p>
<p>then put it out there versus uh just put</p>
<p>out a bunch of crap and I think I</p>
<p>appreciate you noticing that and be are</p>
<p>grateful to you I mean I don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>to thank you for the things that you are</p>
<p>doing it is really helping and in</p>
<p>country like India of where our staple</p>
<p>food comes mostly from cups and then if</p>
<p>you look at a proper food if I go my</p>
<p>hometown and I ask my mom to make a food</p>
<p>she will rip the food that I&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>will be mostly on cups it will be rice</p>
<p>then we call something as Indian bread</p>
<p>they are also made of wheat and then</p>
<p>vegetable is we mostly include potatoes</p>
<p>everywhere so that is how it has been</p>
<p>and exchanging our mindset to follow</p>
<p>kita right is very difficult but your</p>
<p>videos make it really easy to understand</p>
<p>you do affinity it like anyone would</p>
<p>understand it I mean a non medical</p>
<p>background guy is also able to</p>
<p>understand what you talk I mean I can</p>
<p>advise my friends now on diabetes that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how it has been I&rsquo;m glad you like that</p>
<p>yeah I try to explain it to a</p>
<p>seven-year-old so I can really break it</p>
<p>down not assuming that you know anything</p>
<p>just trying to give you the basics but</p>
<p>hey this is a great interview and I want</p>
<p>to thank you for your great success</p>
<p>story and so I&rsquo;m glad we can do it in</p>
<p>your car and it worked out fine it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>totally fine thanks to you doctor all</p>
<p>credit goes to you on my transformation</p>
<p>you have literally saved my life I mean</p>
<p>I had a fatty liver I had so many issues</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you I can&rsquo;t explain those</p>
<p>on video calls but I had so many</p>
<p>complications within going going within</p>
<p>me but now when I look at myself the way</p>
<p>other compliment me it has been amazing</p>
<p>I mean it is very difficult for people</p>
<p>like us who do a sedentary job I am a</p>
<p>computer engineer so I am always on in</p>
<p>front of my computer sitting and doing a</p>
<p>brain work there is no manual physical</p>
<p>activity that I actually do and the</p>
<p>eating habits as well so all credit goes</p>
<p>to you on the transformation that I have</p>
<p>done thank you thank you and my wife</p>
<p>also wants to say you thank you because</p>
<p>she is also off great has I mean it is</p>
<p>helping her also also moving so I</p>
<p>appreciate that</p>
<p>I had one request if you can make a</p>
<p>video on how to build muscles I mean it</p>
<p>most of your videos have been where you</p>
<p>we lose fat and it is very effective but</p>
<p>if you can give some you know tips on</p>
<p>how to build muscles while being in</p>
<p>Quito I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll release at</p>
<p>tomorrow I already did it I just didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really say yes so I was waiting for you</p>
<p>to request it now release it tomorrow</p>
<p>okay great thanks so much thank you sure</p>
<p>have a good one</p>
<p>okay fine</p>
