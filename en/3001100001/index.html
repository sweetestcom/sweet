    <p>Hi guys. Happy South by. I feel like what a way to kick this off. One of the things I love about South by Southwest is I&rsquo;ve been coming for the last decade, and we&rsquo;re always talking about what&rsquo;s the next big thing in tech, and I would say like artificial intelligence and chat GPT is like couldn&rsquo;t be more relevant. So glad to be sitting here with you. How many folks in the audience have used chat GPT?</p>
<p>Okay, so it feels like this is an audience that like we can. That&rsquo;s good. I can be very specific on this stuff, and remember you guys ask questions. I&rsquo;m going to leave 15 minutes at the end to get to it, so I want to get to open AI, and I want to talk about the company behind chat GPT, but I would love to start with chat GPT, so let&rsquo;s go. It&rsquo;s November 22nd. You guys released chat GPT.</p>
<p>This is an AI chatbot that&rsquo;s developed by open AI. It&rsquo;s built on top of large language models, a large language model called GPT-3. You release it November 2022. Over 100 million users in two months, this becomes the fastest growing application in history.</p>
<p>Just for some perspective, it took Facebook meta 4.5 years to reach 100 million users, took TikTok nine months. Like why was chat GPT the killer app?</p>
<p>Yeah, I actually think about this question a lot because for us, you know, we actually had the technology behind it, the model behind it created almost a year prior, so it wasn&rsquo;t new technology, but the thing that we really did differently is that we did a little bit of extra work to make it more aligned, so it really you could talk to it. It would do what you wanted, but secondly, we made it accessible, right?</p>
<p>We built an interface that was super simple. It was kind of the simplest interface we could think of. We made it available for free to anyone, and I think that the thing that was very interesting was as this app really took off and people started using it, we could see the gap between what people thought was possible and what actually had been possible for quite some time.</p>
<p>And I think to me, this is actually maybe the biggest takeaway is that I really want us as a company and as a field to be informing people to make sure that they know what&rsquo;s possible, what&rsquo;s not, kind of what the forefront is going to look like and where things are going because I think that&rsquo;s actually really important to figure out how to absorb this in society, like how do we actually get all the positives and how do we mitigate the negatives?</p>
<p>Like in the past, I mean, should we talk about Tay? We won&rsquo;t talk too much about Tay, but like chatbots are hard to put out there, but there was something about what you put out there, and you talk about that gap, right, that it didn&rsquo;t implode, right? It learned a lot, and all of a sudden, it&rsquo;s almost spurred this whole new era of everyone saying, could we do this? Could we do this? Could we do this? Why now?</p>
<p>Yes, so I, as we were preparing Chachapiti for release, the thing I kept telling to the team was the most important thing, we can be overly conservative in terms of like refusing to do anything that seems even a little bit sketchy, that&rsquo;s fine. Most important thing is that we don&rsquo;t have to like turn it off in three days.</p>
<p>Yeah, are you worried when you kind of like pressed publish on this?</p>
<p>You have to be worried. How could you not, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right, so we&rsquo;ve been doing lots of testing, right? We have our own internal red teams. We&rsquo;ve had beta testers on it, hundreds of beta testers for many, many months, but it&rsquo;s very different from kind of exposing it to kind of the full diversity and adversarial and sort of beautiful force of the world and where people are going to apply it.</p>
<p>And so for us, I think that, you know, we have been doing iterative deployment for a very long time, right? We&rsquo;ve been, you know, ever since, you know, 2020, June or so is when we first released a product, you know, an API so people could use these language models.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been making them more capable, getting them into more people&rsquo;s hands, but we kind of knew this was going to be just a different dimension.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it was our first time building a consumer facing app. And so we definitely were nervous, but I think that the team really rose to the occasion.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, I want to look, I definitely want to talk about the future of ChatGPT because I know a lot of folks, especially we have a lot of users in the audience are curious about it.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s look, I want to start at the, I want to go to the past, right? Because the company behind ChatGPT, Dali, is OpenAI.</p>
<p>And this is, it&rsquo;s interesting because in the Silicon Valley world, you have like a sexy company comes out, everyone&rsquo;s talking about it. OpenAI was just kind of the opposite.</p>
<p>It just was kind of like hanging out in the background until this thing came out. Until you, you know, you put out these products that could shift culture and start all these questions.</p>
<p>And so let&rsquo;s go back. It&rsquo;s 2015, July, and you&rsquo;re in Menlo Park at a fancy hotel called the Rosewood. I don&rsquo;t know if anyone here has been to the Rosewood. It&rsquo;s certainly a scene.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sitting there. Who&rsquo;s there? What are we eating? Why are we there? What&rsquo;s the topic of conversation? And I promise I&rsquo;m going somewhere with this.</p>
<p>Well, I couldn&rsquo;t tell you what was on the menu that night.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But yeah, we were.</p>
<p>I just want to know what Elon Musk was eating during this conversation.</p>
<p>Uh-huh, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, sorry, I got ahead of it. Go ahead.</p>
<p>So we were having a dinner to discuss AI in the future and kind of just what might be possible and whether we could do something positive to affect it.</p>
<p>And so my co-founders at OpenAI, so that&rsquo;s Elon, Sam, Ilya, and other people were all there.</p>
<p>And kind of the question was, is it too late to start a lab with a bunch of the best people at it?</p>
<p>Right, we all kind of saw that like AI feels like it&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>It feels like AGI, really building human level machines, will be achievable.</p>
<p>And what can we do as technologists, as just people who care about this problem, to try to steer in a positive direction?</p>
<p>And kind of the conclusion from the dinner was, it&rsquo;s not obviously impossible to do something here.</p>
<p>You felt a sense of urgency.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>The moment, I think the thing that is easy to miss here, right, is I think now people see ChatGPT and they say, wow, like suddenly you feel the possibilities.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And you both see what&rsquo;s possible, like not science fiction anymore, right, actually usable today.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still hard to kind of extrapolate, to really follow the exponential, to think what might be possible tomorrow.</p>
<p>And I think that the mode that I have been in for a long time has been really thinking about that exponential.</p>
<p>Like I remember reading Alan Turing&rsquo;s 1950 paper on the Turing test.</p>
<p>And the thing that really stuck out to me, and this was right after high school, was he said, look, you&rsquo;re never going to program a machine to solve this problem.</p>
<p>Instead, you need a machine that can actually learn how to do it.</p>
<p>And that for me was the aha moment.</p>
<p>The idea that you could have a machine that could solve problems that I could not, that no human could figure out how to solve.</p>
<p>Like that so clearly could be so transformational, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these challenges, global warming, you know, just like medicine for everyone, like all these things that are kind of out of reach.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how we&rsquo;re going to do it.</p>
<p>But if you could use machines to aid in that process, we want to.</p>
<p>And so I think we all kind of felt like, OK, the technology is starting to happen.</p>
<p>You know, deep learning is an overnight success that took 70 years, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, 2012, there was a big breakthrough on image recognition.</p>
<p>But it really took another decade to start to get to the point that we&rsquo;re at now.</p>
<p>But we could all see that exponential.</p>
<p>And I think we really wanted to really push it along and really steer it.</p>
<p>And I mean, you at the time.</p>
<p>So you before you were the CTO of Stripe, this little company called Stripe.</p>
<p>And you really felt that you, Sam Altman at the time, Elon Musk.</p>
<p>We can get into all this later, but that you guys could build something better and you guys could build something that was pro-humanity and not anti-humanity, which is always that fine line in technology, which I think the last decade has kind of taught us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I would I would quibble a little bit with, you know, I don&rsquo;t know that at least for me personally, that I viewed it as we would build something better.</p>
<p>You know, in the sense of like, you know, there&rsquo;s lots of other people who are in this field doing great work, too.</p>
<p>But I wanted to contribute, you know, and I think it&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s actually very important about AI and something that&rsquo;s very core to our values and our mission is that we think this really should be an endeavor of humanity.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re all thinking about, well, what&rsquo;s my part of it?</p>
<p>You know, like, what do I get to own?</p>
<p>I think that is actually one place where the danger really lies.</p>
<p>And so so tell me about how the company was and is structured, because now that was seven years ago.</p>
<p>So take us behind the curtain.</p>
<p>I saw something Sam Altman wrote.</p>
<p>He said, we&rsquo;ve attempted to set up our structure in a way that aligns our incentives with a good outcome.</p>
<p>What does that even mean?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we are a weird looking company.</p>
<p>In what sense?</p>
<p>So we started as a nonprofit because we had this grand mission, but we did not know how to operationalize it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We know that we want to have AGI benefit all of humanity.</p>
<p>But what is what does that mean?</p>
<p>What are you supposed to do?</p>
<p>And so we started as a research lab.</p>
<p>We hired some PhDs.</p>
<p>We did some research.</p>
<p>We open source some code.</p>
<p>And our original plan was open source everything.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You think about how you can have a good impact.</p>
<p>Maybe if you just make everything available to anyone that can make any changes they want, then, you know, if there&rsquo;s one bad actor, well, you&rsquo;ve got seven billion good actors who can keep them in check.</p>
<p>And, you know, I think that this plan was a good place to start.</p>
<p>But, you know, Ilya and I, we were really the ones running the company in the early days, spent a lot of time really thinking about how do you turn this into the kind of impact that we think is possible and to something that really can make a difference in terms of just how beneficial AGI ends up being.</p>
<p>And I think that we found kind of two important pieces.</p>
<p>One was simply a question of scale.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You know, all the results that we were getting that were impressive and really pushing things forward were requiring bigger and bigger computers.</p>
<p>And we kind of realized that, OK, well, you&rsquo;re just going to need to raise billions of dollars to build these supercomputers.</p>
<p>And we actually tried really hard to raise that money as a nonprofit.</p>
<p>Like I remember sitting in a room during one of these fundraisers and looking in the eyes of a well-known Silicon Valley investor.</p>
<p>Who is that?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t share the name, but he was like, $100 million, which is what we&rsquo;re trying to raise.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s a staggering amount for a nonprofit.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And we looked at each other, we were like, it is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we actually succeeded.</p>
<p>We actually raised the money.</p>
<p>But we realized that 10x that.</p>
<p>That was not going to happen.</p>
<p>I mean, if anyone in this audience knows how to do that as a nonprofit, like, please, we will hire you in an instant.</p>
<p>But we realized that, you know, that if we wanted to actually achieve the mission, that we needed a vehicle that could get us there.</p>
<p>And, you know, we&rsquo;re not anti-capitalist.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s not why we started a nonprofit the way, opening as a nonprofit.</p>
<p>Actually, capitalism is a very good mechanism within the bounds that it&rsquo;s designed for.</p>
<p>But if you do build sort of the most powerful technology ever in a single company, and that thing becomes just like way more valuable or powerful than any company we have today.</p>
<p>Capitalism is not really designed for that.</p>
<p>So we ended up sort of designing this custom bespoke structure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super weird.</p>
<p>Like, we have this limited partnership with all custom docs.</p>
<p>You know, if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re a legal nerd, like, it&rsquo;s the kind of thing that, like, you know, is like actually really, really fun to dig into.</p>
<p>But the way we design things is that we actually have the nonprofit is the governing body.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a board of a nonprofit that kind of owns everything.</p>
<p>It owns this limited partnership that actually has profit interest, but they&rsquo;re capped.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s only a fixed amount that investors and shareholders are able to get.</p>
<p>And that there&rsquo;s a very careful balance in a lot of these details in terms of, like, you know, having the board have a majority of people who don&rsquo;t have profit interest.</p>
<p>All these things in order to really try to change the incentive and make it so that, you know, that the way that we operate the company is it comports with the mission.</p>
<p>And so I think that, you know, this kind of approach of, like, really trying to figure out how do you balance?</p>
<p>How do you approach the mission?</p>
<p>But how do you make it practical?</p>
<p>How do you operationalize it?</p>
<p>That is something that has come up again and again in our history.</p>
<p>And if we look back at the history of, I mean, artificial intelligence like this is nothing new, obviously.</p>
<p>So, like, what is it about now that feels like a watershed moment?</p>
<p>Why now are all companies putting money into this?</p>
<p>Why now is this the thing that we all are talking about?</p>
<p>What is it about the technology now?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I think the fundamental thing here is really about exponentials, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like no matter how many times you hear it, it is still hard to impossible to internalize.</p>
<p>And when I look back, like, we&rsquo;ve done these studies on the growth of compute power in the field.</p>
<p>And we see this nice exponential with a doubling period of, like, every 3.5 months, you know, as opposed to 18 months for Moore&rsquo;s Law.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been going on for the past 10 years or so.</p>
<p>But we actually extrapolated back even further.</p>
<p>And you can see that this exponential continues all the way.</p>
<p>Slightly smaller slope.</p>
<p>It used to be Moore&rsquo;s Law.</p>
<p>But over the past 10 years, basically, people have been being like, well, you can go faster than Moore&rsquo;s Law by just spending more money.</p>
<p>And I think that what&rsquo;s been happening is we&rsquo;ve been having this accumulated value, this slow roll.</p>
<p>Rather than trying to do a flash in the pan, like, just get rich quick kind of thing that maybe other fields have been accused of.</p>
<p>AI, I think, has been a much more steady incremental build of value.</p>
<p>And I think that the thing that&rsquo;s so interesting is normally if you have a technology in search of a problem, adoption is hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new technology.</p>
<p>Everyone has to change their business.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know where it fits in.</p>
<p>But for language in particular, every business is already a language business.</p>
<p>Every flow is a language flow.</p>
<p>And so if you can add a little bit of value, then everyone wants it.</p>
<p>And I think that is the fundamental thing that really has driven the adoption and the excitement.</p>
<p>Is that it just fits into what everyone already wants to do.</p>
<p>Well, and also in 2017, you know, a model called Transformers, right?</p>
<p>These large language models and this idea that you could treat everything as a language.</p>
<p>Music and code and speech and image.</p>
<p>The entire world almost looks like a sequence of tokens, right?</p>
<p>If we could put a language behind it.</p>
<p>That was really an accelerant for a lot of what you&rsquo;re building, too.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that it&rsquo;s, you know, the way they think about the progress, like the technological driver behind this,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s very easy to latch on to any one piece of it, right?</p>
<p>Transformer, definitely a really important thing.</p>
<p>But where the Transformer came from was really trying to figure out how do you get good compute utilization out of the compute hardware that we use?</p>
<p>The GPUs, right?</p>
<p>And the GPUs themselves are really impressive feat of engineering that has required just huge amounts of investment to get there.</p>
<p>And the software stack on top of them.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s kind of each of these pieces.</p>
<p>And each one kind of has its time.</p>
<p>Like one thing that&rsquo;s super interesting to me, looking from the inside,</p>
<p>was that we were working on language models that look very similar to what we do today.</p>
<p>Starting 2016, you know, we had one person, Alec Radford, who was really excited about language.</p>
<p>And, you know, like he just was kind of working on building these little chatbots.</p>
<p>And like, we really liked Alec.</p>
<p>And so we were just like very supportive of him, doing whatever he wanted.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, we were off like investing in serious projects and stuff.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re just like, you know, whatever Alec needs, like we&rsquo;ll make sure he gets.</p>
<p>And 2017, you know, we had a first really interesting result,</p>
<p>which was that we had a model that was trained on Amazon reviews.</p>
<p>And that it was just predicting the next character, the next character, just what letter comes next.</p>
<p>And it actually learned a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis classifier.</p>
<p>You could give it a sentence and it would say like, this is positive or negative.</p>
<p>May not sound very impressive, but this was the moment where we kind of knew it was going to work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so clear that you would transcend it, just syntax, where the commas go.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d move to semantics.</p>
<p>And so we just knew we had to push and push and push.</p>
<p>I mean, it always comes to Amazon reviews.</p>
<p>Who knew that this is the real story behind it?</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly. You always start small.</p>
<p>You know, every day there&rsquo;s a new headline on how this technology is being adapted.</p>
<p>I just literally was Googling it yesterday.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the latest headlines are companies are harnessing the power of a chatbot</p>
<p>to write and automate emails with a little bit of personalization.</p>
<p>Another headline, how Chachapiti can help abuse survivors represent themselves in court if they can&rsquo;t afford.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we obviously know about Microsoft&rsquo;s being and disrupting search.</p>
<p>From the seat that you&rsquo;re sitting in, what for you, and if you could be as specific as possible,</p>
<p>what do you think are the most interesting and disruptive use cases for generative AI?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you know, I actually first want to just tell a personal anecdote</p>
<p>of the kind of thing that I am very hopeful for.</p>
<p>So, you know, medicine is definitely a very high stakes area.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very cautious with, you know, how people should use this kind of technology there.</p>
<p>But even today, I want to talk about a place where I have just been like,</p>
<p>I really want for my own use.</p>
<p>So, you know, my wife, a number of years ago, had a mysterious ailment.</p>
<p>That she had this pulsating pain right here on her abdomen, bottom right side.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t appendicitis.</p>
<p>You know, we went to the first doctor and the doctor was like, oh, I know what this is.</p>
<p>And prescribes some antibiotic.</p>
<p>Nothing happened.</p>
<p>Went to a second doctor who said, oh, it&rsquo;s a super rare disease.</p>
<p>Went to a second doctor who said, oh, it&rsquo;s a super rare bacterial infection.</p>
<p>You need this other super powerful antibiotic.</p>
<p>Took that.</p>
<p>And over the course of three months, we went to four different doctors.</p>
<p>Until finally someone just like did an ultrasound and found what it was.</p>
<p>And I kid you not, I just typed in, you know, a couple sentences of description</p>
<p>that I just gave here into chat GPT.</p>
<p>Said number one, make sure it&rsquo;s not appendicitis.</p>
<p>Number two, ruptured ovarian cyst.</p>
<p>And that is in fact what it was.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And so the kind of thing that I want is I personally in the medical field</p>
<p>want something that I don&rsquo;t rely on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want it to replace a doctor.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want it to tell me like, oh, go take this super rare antibiotic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want a doctor telling me that either.</p>
<p>And also chat GPT sometimes confidently says the exact wrong thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like a drunk frat guy every so often.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So you got to be a little bit careful.</p>
<p>You got to be careful.</p>
<p>Something we&rsquo;re working on.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>And I think that our models actually are much more calibrated than we realize</p>
<p>and can say when they&rsquo;re right or wrong.</p>
<p>But we currently destroy that information in some of the training processes we do.</p>
<p>So more to say there.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think this suggests, give you ideas really, you know, in writing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the blank page problem.</p>
<p>But I think this for me is where generative AI can really shine.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really about sort of unblocking you, giving you ideas,</p>
<p>and just giving you an assistant that is willing to do whatever you want 24</p>
<p>7.</p>
<p>And so let&rsquo;s you&rsquo;ve now the chat GPT has been deployed to millions.</p>
<p>Has there been anything that&rsquo;s really shocked you or surprised you and how</p>
<p>people have been utilizing it?</p>
<p>I mean, of course.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I do think that for me, the overall most interesting thing has just</p>
<p>been seeing just how many people engage with it for so many just sort of</p>
<p>surprising aspects of life.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>I think knowledge work is maybe the area that I kind of see as most</p>
<p>important for us to really focus on.</p>
<p>And, you know, we see people within OpenAI who don&rsquo;t have who aren&rsquo;t native</p>
<p>English speakers use it to improve their writing.</p>
<p>And that you know, at first that there was someone with OpenAI who is</p>
<p>suddenly his you could just tell it the writing style of everything changed.</p>
<p>And it was just like way more fluid and just also just like honestly just</p>
<p>like way more understandable.</p>
<p>And at first, what just happened?</p>
<p>And he literally at one point had hired someone to to do the writing for him.</p>
<p>But that was actually really hard.</p>
<p>It was just like a lot of overhead and he wasn&rsquo;t able to get the points</p>
<p>across.</p>
<p>But with chat GPT, he really was able to.</p>
<p>And I think that that for me is just like so interesting to see that people</p>
<p>just use it as a cognitive aid to think just more clearly and to</p>
<p>communicate with others.</p>
<p>Well, you always know you have disruptive technology when you put it out</p>
<p>there and people misuse it.</p>
<p>I remember a decade ago doing like a story on pimps recruiting women on</p>
<p>Which is like, OK, you know, if someone&rsquo;s using your technology in a bad</p>
<p>way, like you have something that&rsquo;s hitting mainstream.</p>
<p>So like, can you tell us like what how are people using it in ways that</p>
<p>Have you what have you learned from putting this out there?</p>
<p>And what have you learned from how people are misusing it?</p>
<p>Well, misuse is definitely also very core to what we think about.</p>
<p>Part of why we wanted to put this out there was to get feedback to see</p>
<p>how people use it for good and for bad and to continually tune.</p>
<p>And honestly, one of the biggest things that we&rsquo;ve seen, you know,</p>
<p>we always anticipate all the different things that might go wrong for GPT-3.</p>
<p>We really focused on misinformation and that actually the most common</p>
<p>people, the most common abuse vector was generating spam for drugs,</p>
<p>you know, for various medicines.</p>
<p>And so you don&rsquo;t necessarily see the problems around the corner.</p>
<p>For Chachapiti, one thing we&rsquo;ve just seen is people just creating</p>
<p>thousands or hundreds of thousands of accounts in order to just be able</p>
<p>to use it much more.</p>
<p>Some people generating lots of spam.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that people are using it for all sorts of different things.</p>
<p>I think for individuals, there&rsquo;s definitely, I think, actually,</p>
<p>I would say this is an interesting category of, you know, to your point</p>
<p>where it says something that is confidently wrong.</p>
<p>My drunk frat guy point.</p>
<p>Exactly. Yeah. Over reliance. Right.</p>
<p>And thinking, oh, because it said that, it must be true.</p>
<p>Yeah. And that&rsquo;s not true for humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not quite true for AIs.</p>
<p>Yeah. I think we will get there at one point,</p>
<p>but I think that it&rsquo;s going to be a process and something we all need</p>
<p>to participate in. Right.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, I would love to get into kind of what we can predict</p>
<p>in the future with AI, but before we leave Chachapiti,</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t really Chachapiti, but I feel like we have to talk</p>
<p>about Sydney for a moment.</p>
<p>People in the audience, people who heard of,</p>
<p>who read Kevin Roose&rsquo;s article in the New York Times?</p>
<p>Right. So just a little background.</p>
<p>You know, you guys put Chachapiti out there,</p>
<p>Microsoft, Google, racing to get search products out there.</p>
<p>Microsoft releases its own AI-powered search,</p>
<p>a Bing chatbot, and all of a sudden, Kevin Roose,</p>
<p>great writer at the New York Times, is playing with it,</p>
<p>with the Bing chatbot.</p>
<p>It reveals that its name is, the shadow name is Sydney,</p>
<p>and also tries and tells Kevin when prompted a certain way,</p>
<p>I want to be alive, and tried to persuade him to leave his wife.</p>
<p>So obviously, that&rsquo;s like an awkward conversation.</p>
<p>So what are the guardrails?</p>
<p>And to be clear, Microsoft&rsquo;s an investor and partner.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t something that OpenAI specifically put out there,</p>
<p>but I do think it&rsquo;s an interesting point of saying,</p>
<p>you put this stuff out there, the next thing you know,</p>
<p>like, I don&rsquo;t know, Sydney&rsquo;s trying to make you leave your wife.</p>
<p>So like, what are the guardrails that need to be put in?</p>
<p>Like, what have you learned over the last couple months</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve seen the misuse, and what can you put in</p>
<p>to make sure that we&rsquo;re not all, you know,</p>
<p>trying to leave our significant others</p>
<p>that bots are telling us to?</p>
<p>I mean, look, like, there&rsquo;s, I think that even the,</p>
<p>I think this is actually a great question, right?</p>
<p>And I think that even the most high-order bit, right,</p>
<p>the most important thing in my mind,</p>
<p>is this question of when.</p>
<p>When do you want to release?</p>
<p>And my point earlier of, well, there was this overhang</p>
<p>in terms of this gap between people&rsquo;s expectations,</p>
<p>what they were prepared for,</p>
<p>and what was actually possible.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s actually where a lot of the danger lies.</p>
<p>You know, we can kind of joke about or laugh about this article</p>
<p>because it wasn&rsquo;t very convincing.</p>
<p>You know, just like chatbot saying, you know, leave your wife.</p>
<p>Sydney was pretty spicy, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was very spicy, right?</p>
<p>But did not actually have an impact, you know?</p>
<p>And I think that is actually, in my mind,</p>
<p>the most important thing, is trying to surface these things</p>
<p>as early in the process as possible, right?</p>
<p>Before you have some system that is much more persuasive</p>
<p>or capable or able to operate in more subtle ways.</p>
<p>Because we want to build trust</p>
<p>and figure out where we can&rsquo;t trust yet.</p>
<p>You know, figure out where we put the guardrails in.</p>
<p>So that, to me, this is the process, right?</p>
<p>This is the pain of the learning.</p>
<p>And that we&rsquo;ve seen this across the board, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen places where people try really hard</p>
<p>to get the model to do something,</p>
<p>and it says, sorry, nope, can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen places where people use it for positive things,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve seen cases where people have outcomes like this.</p>
<p>And so, I think that my answer is that, you know,</p>
<p>we have a team that works really hard on these problems.</p>
<p>You know, that we have people who build on top of us,</p>
<p>who customize the technology in different ways.</p>
<p>But fundamentally, I think that we&rsquo;re all very aligned</p>
<p>in terms of trying to make this technology</p>
<p>more trustworthy and usable.</p>
<p>And, you know, we do a lot of red teaming internally.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s, you know, we hire experts in different domains.</p>
<p>We hire lots of people to try to break the models.</p>
<p>You know, when we actually released it,</p>
<p>we knew, like, we&rsquo;d kind of cleared a bar, we felt,</p>
<p>in terms of just how hard it was</p>
<p>to get it to go off the rails.</p>
<p>But we knew it wasn&rsquo;t perfect.</p>
<p>We knew that we had come up with some ways</p>
<p>to get around it with sufficient effort.</p>
<p>And we knew that other people would find more, too.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve been feeding all that back in.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been learning from what we see in practice.</p>
<p>And so I think that this sort of loop</p>
<p>of there being failures, I think that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>Because if not, it means you&rsquo;re kind of holding it too long</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re being too conservative.</p>
<p>And then when you do release it,</p>
<p>now you actually are taking on much more risk</p>
<p>and much more danger.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not 100% true in all cases,</p>
<p>but I think that that heuristic, I think, is important.</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s also, we&rsquo;ll get to it a little bit later,</p>
<p>but an important segue, too,</p>
<p>to talk about the future of misinformation</p>
<p>and how we can prep now for what&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>with this innovation.</p>
<p>Before we get to it, I mean,</p>
<p>I think one of the most interesting things to me</p>
<p>is the ability for this technology</p>
<p>to synthesize information and make predictions</p>
<p>and identify patterns.</p>
<p>So can you tell me what you think</p>
<p>the most interesting future use cases</p>
<p>of what artificial intelligence will be able to predict</p>
<p>will be, like predict disease,</p>
<p>predict stock market,</p>
<p>predict if you&rsquo;re going to get a, not you,</p>
<p>if someone&rsquo;s going to get a divorce?</p>
<p>What could this predict?</p>
<p>Paint the image of the future.</p>
<p>Well, I think that the real story here in my mind</p>
<p>is amplification of what humans can do.</p>
<p>And I think that that will be true on knowledge work.</p>
<p>I think that it will just be that we&rsquo;re all,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like if you hire six assistants</p>
<p>who are all like, you know, they&rsquo;re not perfect.</p>
<p>They need to be trained up a little bit.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t quite know exactly what you want always,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re so eager, they never sleep.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re there to help you.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re willing to do the drudge work.</p>
<p>And you get to be the director.</p>
<p>And I think that that is going to be</p>
<p>what writing will look like.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what sort of, you know,</p>
<p>business communication will look like.</p>
<p>But I also think that is what entertainment will look like.</p>
<p>You think about today</p>
<p>where everyone watches the same TV show.</p>
<p>And, you know, maybe people are still upset</p>
<p>about the last season of Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>But imagine if you could ask your AI</p>
<p>to make a new ending that goes a different way.</p>
<p>And maybe even put yourself in there</p>
<p>as a main character or something.</p>
<p>Having interactive experiences.</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s just going to be</p>
<p>every aspect of life</p>
<p>is going to be sort of amplified by this technology.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure there are some aspects,</p>
<p>people or companies that will say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Like, I think it&rsquo;s really going to be a tool</p>
<p>just like the cell phone in your pocket</p>
<p>that is going to be available when it makes sense.</p>
<p>I think, we think a lot at my company</p>
<p>about we&rsquo;re knee-deep in exploring</p>
<p>how artificial intelligence can personalize content,</p>
<p>develop closer relationships with the audience,</p>
<p>which is a wide open space</p>
<p>and an interesting space.</p>
<p>But also there&rsquo;s so many ethics that come up with that.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re developing a lot of</p>
<p>these ethical frameworks around it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious, when you talk about Game of Thrones</p>
<p>and personalized media</p>
<p>and being able to put yourself in it,</p>
<p>when we look at the future of media and entertainment,</p>
<p>would you say this is a new frontier</p>
<p>for personalized media?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think for sure.</p>
<p>And I kind of think it&rsquo;s a new frontier</p>
<p>for most areas.</p>
<p>You know, it may not be great yet</p>
<p>at some domains,</p>
<p>but I think that we are just going to see</p>
<p>just like way more creative action happening.</p>
<p>And to me, actually, the thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>I think most sort of encouraging</p>
<p>is I think it will be</p>
<p>the barriers to entry decrease.</p>
<p>And this is, by the way,</p>
<p>how we thought about things at Stripe.</p>
<p>Decrease the barrier to people</p>
<p>making payments online,</p>
<p>to people making services.</p>
<p>Way more activity happens,</p>
<p>things you would never think of.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;ll see this in content.</p>
<p>Individuals who have a creative idea</p>
<p>that they want to see realized,</p>
<p>they now have a whole creative studio</p>
<p>at their disposal.</p>
<p>But also the pros,</p>
<p>the people who really want to make something good</p>
<p>or make something way better</p>
<p>than any of the amateurs could.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen this with Dolly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s literally these 100-page books</p>
<p>that people write on how to prompt Dolly.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all these murky questions</p>
<p>around identity and attribution</p>
<p>as these models go mainstream.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not perfectly clear</p>
<p>what the data sets are used to train.</p>
<p>So when we take a step back,</p>
<p>and this is a more fundamental question,</p>
<p>should an artist style</p>
<p>with models trained on their work,</p>
<p>should it be available to folks,</p>
<p>to anyone without use of attribution?</p>
<p>What are you guys thinking about</p>
<p>when it comes to these ethical?</p>
<p>Yeah, so we engage very closely</p>
<p>with policymakers,</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s something that we have.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, we as a company</p>
<p>want to provide information</p>
<p>and to show just what&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>and let there be a public conversation</p>
<p>about these topics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that we have all the answers,</p>
<p>but we think it&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>to be talking about.</p>
<p>So take me for example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like the beta test.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put myself in the driver&rsquo;s seat.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say someone took all the footage</p>
<p>of me interviewing folks like you,</p>
<p>Zuckerberg, whatever,</p>
<p>and they trained this as a Lori model.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already named it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t do it, guys.</p>
<p>And then, I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m inviting this,</p>
<p>but then they launched a podcast</p>
<p>using my likeness, my style, my voice.</p>
<p>Hopefully you&rsquo;d have fabulous style.</p>
<p>That would be all I&rsquo;d ask.</p>
<p>But could they do it?</p>
<p>Should they get a cut?</p>
<p>Should I get a say in it?</p>
<p>As a content creator,</p>
<p>as someone who&rsquo;s sat at the center</p>
<p>of the conversation about the future,</p>
<p>what does that look like?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Again, I think this is a great question.</p>
<p>I think it would be kind of</p>
<p>futuristic of me to say</p>
<p>that I have all the answers,</p>
<p>but I can tell you a little bit</p>
<p>about how we think about it.</p>
<p>As a company, our mission to build AGI</p>
<p>that benefits all of humanity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve kind of built with this</p>
<p>cap profit structure.</p>
<p>I really think that an answer</p>
<p>on this question, but more broadly,</p>
<p>all of humanity are kind of</p>
<p>stakeholders in what gets built.</p>
<p>Everyone benefits if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>access to these services,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re able to</p>
<p>have your AI personality</p>
<p>or this AI that you build up</p>
<p>that represents you</p>
<p>and build a business with that.</p>
<p>I think all of this is on the table.</p>
<p>I do think that we need</p>
<p>some sort of,</p>
<p>I think that society as a whole</p>
<p>needs to adapt here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that</p>
<p>we need to think done</p>
<p>to get a little black mirror,</p>
<p>but why not?</p>
<p>Do you see a future where</p>
<p>we verify our own AI identities</p>
<p>and we can license them out</p>
<p>so I could license out</p>
<p>my likeness to some degree?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Again, I think kind of</p>
<p>everything is on the table.</p>
<p>I think actually this,</p>
<p>to your earlier question too</p>
<p>of why now, what&rsquo;s happening now,</p>
<p>is I think everyone kind of</p>
<p>agrees that I think</p>
<p>where content comes from,</p>
<p>in good and bad ways,</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s created,</p>
<p>what an application is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Web 1.0 and 2.0</p>
<p>or something,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not going to talk</p>
<p>about Web 3.</p>
<p>Is it too soon?</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>More to say there.</p>
<p>I think that where we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>is what an application is</p>
<p>will be very different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s static.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t really interact with it,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re clearly moving</p>
<p>to a world where it&rsquo;s alive.</p>
<p>You can talk to it</p>
<p>and it understands you</p>
<p>and helps you.</p>
<p>Honestly, every time I go</p>
<p>through some menu</p>
<p>and I keep trying to find</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m supposed to click,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>why is this still here?</p>
<p>I think in the future</p>
<p>it will not.</p>
<p>How much powerful</p>
<p>is the current technology</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re building?</p>
<p>We are continuing</p>
<p>to make, I say,</p>
<p>significant progress.</p>
<p>Blink twice if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ten times more powerful.</p>
<p>Or, okay,</p>
<p>three times.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>I guess all I can say</p>
<p>is that I can&rsquo;t comment</p>
<p>on unreleased work,</p>
<p>but I can say that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a lot of rumors</p>
<p>swirling around about</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re going to be releasing</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s coming out.</p>
<p>What I can definitely say</p>
<p>is that we do not release</p>
<p>until we feel good</p>
<p>about the safety</p>
<p>and the risk mitigations.</p>
<p>You guys have the ability</p>
<p>to turn up the dial,</p>
<p>turn down the dial.</p>
<p>I joke about ChatGPT</p>
<p>confidently.</p>
<p>It does so many</p>
<p>things, right?</p>
<p>Can you give any insight,</p>
<p>maybe speaking,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>we could speak around it</p>
<p>about what future versions</p>
<p>are going to look like?</p>
<p>Will it be more cautious,</p>
<p>more creative?</p>
<p>Let me give you a mental</p>
<p>model for how we build</p>
<p>these systems.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a first step</p>
<p>in the process</p>
<p>of training what we</p>
<p>do.</p>
<p>It sees all the bad stuff.</p>
<p>It sees true facts.</p>
<p>It sees math problems</p>
<p>with good answers</p>
<p>and incorrect answers.</p>
<p>No one tells its incorrect</p>
<p>answers.</p>
<p>It sees everything.</p>
<p>It learns to predict.</p>
<p>It learns to,</p>
<p>given some document,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s supposed to predict</p>
<p>what comes next.</p>
<p>It has to think</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s the next word.</p>
<p>That model,</p>
<p>it has every bias,</p>
<p>it has every ideology,</p>
<p>it has every idea</p>
<p>that has been almost</p>
<p>expressed in this system,</p>
<p>compressed and learned</p>
<p>in a real way.</p>
<p>Then we do a second step</p>
<p>of reinforcement learning</p>
<p>from human preferences,</p>
<p>of what we call post-training.</p>
<p>Here you move from this</p>
<p>giant sea of data of</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the next word,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the next thing.</p>
<p>Here I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>important, very fraught.</p>
<p>This question of,</p>
<p>what should the AI do?</p>
<p>Who should pick that?</p>
<p>That is also a whole</p>
<p>different conversation.</p>
<p>That second step is</p>
<p>where these behaviors come</p>
<p>from.</p>
<p>I alluded to earlier</p>
<p>that we found that the</p>
<p>base model itself is</p>
<p>actually right with</p>
<p>quite good precision.</p>
<p>But our current</p>
<p>post-training process,</p>
<p>this next step that we</p>
<p>do to really say,</p>
<p>no, no, no, this is</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re supposed to do.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really include</p>
<p>any of that calibration</p>
<p>in there.</p>
<p>That the model really</p>
<p>learns, you know what,</p>
<p>just go for it.</p>
<p>That I think is a</p>
<p>engineering challenge</p>
<p>for us to address.</p>
<p>You should expect that</p>
<p>even with the current</p>
<p>chatGB team, we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>released four or five</p>
<p>versions since December</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve gotten</p>
<p>a lot better.</p>
<p>Factuality improves,</p>
<p>that hallucinations</p>
<p>are a problem.</p>
<p>People talk about those</p>
<p>have improved.</p>
<p>A lot of the jailbreaks</p>
<p>that used to work</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t work anymore.</p>
<p>And that is because</p>
<p>of the post-training</p>
<p>process.</p>
<p>And so I would expect</p>
<p>that we will have</p>
<p>systems that are much</p>
<p>more calibrated,</p>
<p>that are able to</p>
<p>sort of check their</p>
<p>own work,</p>
<p>that are able to</p>
<p>be much more calibrated</p>
<p>on when they should</p>
<p>refuse, when they</p>
<p>should help you,</p>
<p>but also that are</p>
<p>able to help you</p>
<p>solve more ambitious</p>
<p>tasks.</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>Well, you know,</p>
<p>I think that the</p>
<p>kinds of things that</p>
<p>I want as a programmer</p>
<p>is that, you know,</p>
<p>right now, we started</p>
<p>with a program called</p>
<p>Copilot, which can do</p>
<p>sort of, you know,</p>
<p>just like autocomplete</p>
<p>a line.</p>
<p>And it was very useful</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>know the programming</p>
<p>language that you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>or you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>specific library functions,</p>
<p>that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically like,</p>
<p>you know, being able</p>
<p>to get, skip the</p>
<p>dictionary and look up</p>
<p>and it just does it</p>
<p>for you right there</p>
<p>in your text editor.</p>
<p>With chatGPT, you</p>
<p>can start being more</p>
<p>ambitious, you can</p>
<p>start asking to write</p>
<p>whole functions for you</p>
<p>or like, oh, like you</p>
<p>write the skeleton of</p>
<p>writing a bot in this</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>And I think that where</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to go is</p>
<p>towards systems that</p>
<p>could help you be much</p>
<p>more like a manager,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Where you can really</p>
<p>be like, okay, I want</p>
<p>a software system that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>architected in this way</p>
<p>and the system goes</p>
<p>and it writes a lot</p>
<p>of the pieces and</p>
<p>actually tests them</p>
<p>and runs them.</p>
<p>And I think this</p>
<p>kind of like moving,</p>
<p>you know, giving</p>
<p>everyone a promotion,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Like making you into</p>
<p>more of the, you know,</p>
<p>the CEO of a company</p>
<p>and making you more</p>
<p>of the person who</p>
<p>does the whole pay</p>
<p>grades.</p>
<p>I think literally</p>
<p>and figuratively, I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>kind of thing that</p>
<p>they would do.</p>
<p>So the future of</p>
<p>chatGPT is we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>getting a promotion.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not too bad</p>
<p>if we achieve it.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>obviously a lot of</p>
<p>fear around the</p>
<p>future of artificial</p>
<p>intelligence, right?</p>
<p>People say AI&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>for our jobs.</p>
<p>Be honest with all</p>
<p>of our friends here.</p>
<p>What jobs are most</p>
<p>at risk?</p>
<p>And one of the</p>
<p>things that I think</p>
<p>about this, certainly</p>
<p>that I did, was it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very clear that AI&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coming for the jobs.</p>
<p>Just a question of</p>
<p>what order?</p>
<p>And clearly the like,</p>
<p>you know, ones that</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t, you know, that</p>
<p>are like menial or,</p>
<p>you know, just like</p>
<p>require physical work</p>
<p>or something like</p>
<p>that, oh, the robots</p>
<p>will come for that</p>
<p>first.</p>
<p>And in reality, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been very different,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>That actually we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>made great strides on</p>
<p>cognitive labor,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>On, you know, think</p>
<p>about writing poems or,</p>
<p>you know, anything like</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>And we have not made</p>
<p>very much progress on</p>
<p>physical things.</p>
<p>And I think that this</p>
<p>amplification is kind of</p>
<p>showing a very different</p>
<p>character from what was</p>
<p>expected.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also the case</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>automated a whole job,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>That you think about, I</p>
<p>think the lesson from</p>
<p>that is that humans, I</p>
<p>think, are much more</p>
<p>capable than we give</p>
<p>ourselves credit for,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>To actually, you know,</p>
<p>do your job, to do</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing right</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just-</p>
<p>Well, I asked</p>
<p>ChatGPT.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t the</p>
<p>ChatGPT questions.</p>
<p>These are the</p>
<p>ChatGPT questions.</p>
<p>I had to follow up and</p>
<p>say, can you be more</p>
<p>hard-hitting?</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Well, thank you.</p>
<p>Are these the hard-</p>
<p>hitting ones?</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re coming.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re about to go into</p>
<p>the future of truth right</p>
<p>after this.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>But ChatGPT, it&rsquo;s not up</p>
<p>here on stage with me.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>personal relationship</p>
<p>aspect.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this judgment</p>
<p>aspect.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many details</p>
<p>that are what you want</p>
<p>from the person in</p>
<p>charge.</p>
<p>But the, like, writing</p>
<p>of the actual copy, I</p>
<p>mean, who cares about</p>
<p>that?</p>
<p>But the, like,</p>
<p>writing of the actual</p>
<p>copy, I mean, who cares</p>
<p>about that?</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll do the</p>
<p>follow-up.</p>
<p>Well, probably we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>do the follow-up</p>
<p>question.</p>
<p>My follow-up</p>
<p>question is, so give</p>
<p>us a couple jobs</p>
<p>most at risk.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I&rsquo;ll tell</p>
<p>you, the one that I</p>
<p>think is is actually</p>
<p>content moderator.</p>
<p>So jobs, what I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>really seen is jobs</p>
<p>that you kind of didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want human judgment</p>
<p>there in the first</p>
<p>place, right?</p>
<p>You really just wanted</p>
<p>a set of rules that</p>
<p>could be followed, and</p>
<p>you kind of wanted a</p>
<p>computer to do it.</p>
<p>And then you had</p>
<p>to decide, is this</p>
<p>thing sufficiently</p>
<p>horrible or just</p>
<p>like slightly not</p>
<p>sufficiently horrible</p>
<p>to be disallowed?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something I already</p>
<p>see this technology</p>
<p>impacting.</p>
<p>So that might be a</p>
<p>good segue into the</p>
<p>future of truth,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Because I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re entering this</p>
<p>really fascinating,</p>
<p>exciting, and scary</p>
<p>era of you have the</p>
<p>rise of deep fakes,</p>
<p>these automated</p>
<p>chatbots that could</p>
<p>have the ability to</p>
<p>persuade someone one</p>
<p>way or the other.</p>
<p>What happens to truth</p>
<p>in an era where AI</p>
<p>just makes fiction so</p>
<p>believable?</p>
<p>Well, I have a</p>
<p>slightly spicy take</p>
<p>here, which is that I</p>
<p>think technology has</p>
<p>not been kind in a lot</p>
<p>of ways to journalism.</p>
<p>And I think that AI</p>
<p>and this particular</p>
<p>problem might actually</p>
<p>be something that is</p>
<p>quite kind and actually</p>
<p>really reinforces the</p>
<p>need for authoritative</p>
<p>sources that can tell</p>
<p>you this is real,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>We actually went out,</p>
<p>had humans investigate</p>
<p>this, that we looked at</p>
<p>all the different sides</p>
<p>of this thing, and this</p>
<p>is actually user</p>
<p>authenticated videos or</p>
<p>whatever it is that can</p>
<p>tell you what happened</p>
<p>and what the facts are.</p>
<p>And so I think that</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re going to go</p>
<p>is away from a world</p>
<p>where because certainly</p>
<p>you saw some text</p>
<p>somewhere that you can</p>
<p>trust it&rsquo;s true, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never really been the</p>
<p>case.</p>
<p>Humans have always been</p>
<p>very good at writing</p>
<p>fake text.</p>
<p>Images,</p>
<p>pictures,</p>
<p>images,</p>
<p>images,</p>
<p>doctored images,</p>
<p>those have existed since</p>
<p>the invention of</p>
<p>photography.</p>
<p>But this gives us the</p>
<p>ability to do this at</p>
<p>viral speed.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>All the bad things that</p>
<p>happened over the last</p>
<p>decade, if we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>careful, this will</p>
<p>amplify.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I think this is,</p>
<p>to me, I agree with</p>
<p>this, right?</p>
<p>I think this is kind of</p>
<p>the crux is that the</p>
<p>fact of being able to do</p>
<p>these things at all,</p>
<p>not new.</p>
<p>The fact of being able</p>
<p>to do it with a much</p>
<p>lower barrier to entry,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s new.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what sparked the need</p>
<p>for new solutions.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never had real</p>
<p>answers for sort of</p>
<p>chain of custody of</p>
<p>information online.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never really had</p>
<p>verified identities.</p>
<p>All these things people</p>
<p>talked about since the</p>
<p>beginning of the</p>
<p>internet.</p>
<p>But I think there was</p>
<p>never really a need for</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And I think the need</p>
<p>will come.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I, the folks, I was at</p>
<p>an event for the folks</p>
<p>for the Center for</p>
<p>Humane Technology.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the folks who</p>
<p>did also like the</p>
<p>Social Dilemma, which</p>
<p>in my opinion, Social</p>
<p>Dilemma&rsquo;s great, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>having these conversations</p>
<p>for 10 years before</p>
<p>Netflix puts out a</p>
<p>doc and asks these</p>
<p>questions, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re at the</p>
<p>beginning of an</p>
<p>interesting era.</p>
<p>We should ask these</p>
<p>questions, you know,</p>
<p>before like we have to</p>
<p>do a sexy doc on it in</p>
<p>10 years.</p>
<p>So there was something</p>
<p>that was said there that</p>
<p>I thought was really</p>
<p>important.</p>
<p>They said that 2024</p>
<p>will be the last human</p>
<p>election, meaning by</p>
<p>2028, we will see</p>
<p>synthesized ads, viral</p>
<p>information powered by</p>
<p>artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Someone releases a</p>
<p>Biden-Trump filter,</p>
<p>tens of millions of</p>
<p>videos are going out</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>How do we build now?</p>
<p>Like what has to</p>
<p>happen now in your</p>
<p>opinion to get ahead of</p>
<p>what will be the</p>
<p>inevitable downside of</p>
<p>this?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I think this is a</p>
<p>great question and I</p>
<p>think this is like maybe</p>
<p>also going to be a tip</p>
<p>of an iceberg kind of</p>
<p>problem where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the most visible</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clearly extremely</p>
<p>impactful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one that, you</p>
<p>know, has been very</p>
<p>topical for a long</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>But I think that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to see the same</p>
<p>questions appearing</p>
<p>across all sorts of</p>
<p>human endeavor of just</p>
<p>as there&rsquo;s more access</p>
<p>to creation, how do</p>
<p>you sift through for</p>
<p>good creation?</p>
<p>How do you actually,</p>
<p>you know, find what is</p>
<p>true or find what is</p>
<p>high quality or, you</p>
<p>know, how do you make</p>
<p>sense of it?</p>
<p>And I think some of</p>
<p>this is really going to</p>
<p>be about what people</p>
<p>building good tools.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;ve seen this</p>
<p>within, I think, the</p>
<p>social media space.</p>
<p>Like even, for example,</p>
<p>you know, people</p>
<p>building tools for</p>
<p>cyber harassment, you</p>
<p>know, to make it so</p>
<p>that people can easily</p>
<p>block, you know,</p>
<p>various efforts and</p>
<p>things like that.</p>
<p>And I think that we</p>
<p>need lots of tools to</p>
<p>be able to do that.</p>
<p>And I think that we</p>
<p>need lots of tools to</p>
<p>be built here that are</p>
<p>really tackling this</p>
<p>problem.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s one reason</p>
<p>that we, you know, we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t just build chat</p>
<p>GPT, the app.</p>
<p>Actually, our main focus</p>
<p>is building a platform.</p>
<p>So we release an API.</p>
<p>Anyone can use this to</p>
<p>build applications.</p>
<p>And I think that you</p>
<p>have an opportunity,</p>
<p>some using traditional</p>
<p>technology, some using,</p>
<p>you know, the AI</p>
<p>technology itself in</p>
<p>order to actually sift</p>
<p>through and figure out</p>
<p>like what is high</p>
<p>quality curated and</p>
<p>people want to play</p>
<p>with it.</p>
<p>And so I think that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>things that we need</p>
<p>to do.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>things that we need</p>
<p>to do is to create</p>
<p>an API that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>high quality curated and</p>
<p>people want to put</p>
<p>their stamp of</p>
<p>approval on it.</p>
<p>I remember the</p>
<p>move fast and</p>
<p>break things era of</p>
<p>meta-Facebook.</p>
<p>Remember they used</p>
<p>to have the sign that</p>
<p>said move fast and</p>
<p>break things.</p>
<p>I know Open AI put</p>
<p>these things out there</p>
<p>in an iterative way and</p>
<p>has a philosophy about</p>
<p>limiting growth to</p>
<p>some degree and</p>
<p>getting feedback.</p>
<p>But now I would say</p>
<p>because of what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>launched, there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>AI race with the</p>
<p>biggest companies</p>
<p>around the world</p>
<p>that is like what</p>
<p>is the best for</p>
<p>society?</p>
<p>What do you think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve learned from</p>
<p>the last decade of</p>
<p>tech innovation that</p>
<p>we must use as we</p>
<p>enter into this new</p>
<p>era where the stakes</p>
<p>you could argue are</p>
<p>even higher?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We think about this a</p>
<p>lot.</p>
<p>Like I have spent a</p>
<p>lot of time really</p>
<p>trying to understand</p>
<p>for each of the big</p>
<p>tech companies, you</p>
<p>know, what did they</p>
<p>do wrong?</p>
<p>And right.</p>
<p>But to the extent</p>
<p>that things, that</p>
<p>mistakes were made,</p>
<p>like what are they,</p>
<p>what can we learn?</p>
<p>And actually one thing</p>
<p>I found very</p>
<p>interesting is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not really</p>
<p>consensus on that</p>
<p>answer.</p>
<p>Like I wish there was</p>
<p>a clean narrative that</p>
<p>everyone knew and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just like just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do this thing.</p>
<p>Well, I could give an</p>
<p>opinion.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>I would love it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve interviewed Mark</p>
<p>Zuckerberg many times</p>
<p>and I would say just</p>
<p>having been across</p>
<p>from some of those</p>
<p>folks, I think the</p>
<p>biggest mistake is</p>
<p>not understanding</p>
<p>humans.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, right?</p>
<p>So how I think like,</p>
<p>you know.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got the stamp</p>
<p>of approval on this.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>And the audience.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s, I</p>
<p>mean, it sounds like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve done a lot of,</p>
<p>you guys have done a</p>
<p>lot of thinking into</p>
<p>how you put this out</p>
<p>there and how you</p>
<p>build out these APIs</p>
<p>that other people can</p>
<p>build on.</p>
<p>Who are the people</p>
<p>that need to build</p>
<p>out for these</p>
<p>solutions?</p>
<p>Like who can you</p>
<p>guys, now that you</p>
<p>have a seat in Silicon</p>
<p>Valley and you&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>this really powerful</p>
<p>place, like who do</p>
<p>you guys bring in</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s different,</p>
<p>diverse and interesting?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we do quite a lot</p>
<p>of outreach and I</p>
<p>actually think this is</p>
<p>a really good example</p>
<p>on how we make</p>
<p>decisions on the</p>
<p>limits of what the</p>
<p>AI should say.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve written a blog</p>
<p>post about this, but</p>
<p>we think that this is</p>
<p>something that really</p>
<p>needs legitimacy.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t just be a</p>
<p>company in Silicon</p>
<p>Valley.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t just be us</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s making these</p>
<p>decisions.</p>
<p>It has to be</p>
<p>collective.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually, and we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have more to share</p>
<p>soon in terms of</p>
<p>exactly what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing, but we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really trying to</p>
<p>scale up efforts to</p>
<p>get input to actually</p>
<p>be able to help</p>
<p>make collective</p>
<p>decisions.</p>
<p>And so I think</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s just so</p>
<p>clear that you do</p>
<p>need everyone to</p>
<p>have a seat at the</p>
<p>table here and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>very committed to.</p>
<p>And then talking</p>
<p>like regulation, I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s, Open</p>
<p>AI talks about moving</p>
<p>at a bit of a slower</p>
<p>pace, but these tools</p>
<p>are being deployed to</p>
<p>millions.</p>
<p>So the FDA doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>allow a drug to go</p>
<p>out to the market</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s safe.</p>
<p>So what is the</p>
<p>right regulation look</p>
<p>like for artificial</p>
<p>intelligence and what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening?</p>
<p>So yeah, this is</p>
<p>again something we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been engaging with</p>
<p>Congressional</p>
<p>testimonies back in</p>
<p>like 2016, 2017.</p>
<p>It was so</p>
<p>interesting to see</p>
<p>that policymakers</p>
<p>were already quite</p>
<p>smart on these issues</p>
<p>and already starting</p>
<p>to engage.</p>
<p>And I think that,</p>
<p>you know, one thing</p>
<p>we think is really</p>
<p>important is really</p>
<p>about focusing</p>
<p>regulation on</p>
<p>regulating harms,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>tempting to regulate</p>
<p>the means.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>seeing this right now</p>
<p>with like the EU AI</p>
<p>Act that&rsquo;s kind of a</p>
<p>question of exactly</p>
<p>how to sort of</p>
<p>operationalize some</p>
<p>of these issues.</p>
<p>And the thing you</p>
<p>really want is to</p>
<p>really say like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s think about</p>
<p>the stakes and</p>
<p>really parse apart</p>
<p>what are high-stakes</p>
<p>areas, what are</p>
<p>low-stakes areas,</p>
<p>what does it mean</p>
<p>to do a good job,</p>
<p>how do you know?</p>
<p>And these sort of</p>
<p>measurements and</p>
<p>evaluations, like</p>
<p>those are really,</p>
<p>really critical.</p>
<p>And so we think</p>
<p>the government,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a key part</p>
<p>of the issue,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Like this question</p>
<p>of how do you</p>
<p>get everyone</p>
<p>involved?</p>
<p>The answer is we</p>
<p>have institutions</p>
<p>that are meant</p>
<p>to be able to</p>
<p>regulate these</p>
<p>issues.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I</p>
<p>have Facebook made</p>
<p>money and the</p>
<p>answer was like</p>
<p>we sell ads.</p>
<p>So really</p>
<p>understanding because</p>
<p>it certainly seems</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be all these</p>
<p>new issues.</p>
<p>Should there be</p>
<p>a new regulatory</p>
<p>body for this?</p>
<p>Again, I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on the table.</p>
<p>I think more</p>
<p>likely what I see</p>
<p>happening is like</p>
<p>I think that AI</p>
<p>is just going to</p>
<p>be so baked into</p>
<p>so many different</p>
<p>pieces and honestly</p>
<p>so helpful in so</p>
<p>many different areas</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>strategy.</p>
<p>But I think that</p>
<p>every organization,</p>
<p>government or</p>
<p>otherwise, is going</p>
<p>to have to understand</p>
<p>AI and really</p>
<p>figure it out.</p>
<p>I know we have to</p>
<p>wrap soon because</p>
<p>I want to get to</p>
<p>questions but I</p>
<p>thought we could</p>
<p>do a little</p>
<p>lightning round.</p>
<p>I love a good</p>
<p>lightning round.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>AI will be</p>
<p>sentient when?</p>
<p>Long time from</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>Like how long?</p>
<p>This kind of</p>
<p>question I prefer</p>
<p>not to comment on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to answer.</p>
<p>Most interesting</p>
<p>question.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be just</p>
<p>making your dreams</p>
<p>come to life.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>In what sense?</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not part of</p>
<p>the lightning round.</p>
<p>You hook up your</p>
<p>brain machine interface</p>
<p>and then you do a</p>
<p>nice rendering and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get great</p>
<p>visions of your</p>
<p>dreams.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Spiciest take on</p>
<p>the future of AI</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>generally not</p>
<p>allowed to say</p>
<p>publicly.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be</p>
<p>making your</p>
<p>dreams come to</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to figure it</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to go well.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re optimistic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m optimistic.</p>
<p>I consider myself</p>
<p>an optimistic realist.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to go well by</p>
<p>default, but I</p>
<p>think humanity can</p>
<p>rise to this challenge.</p>
<p>Elon Musk no longer</p>
<p>really deeply involved</p>
<p>with open AI,</p>
<p>building potentially</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>anti-woke AI.</p>
<p>Success or failure?</p>
<p>Well, I think a</p>
<p>failure on our part</p>
<p>for sure.</p>
<p>In what sense?</p>
<p>Well, I think we</p>
<p>were not fast enough</p>
<p>with our biases in</p>
<p>chat GPT, and we</p>
<p>did not intend them</p>
<p>to be there, that</p>
<p>our goal really was</p>
<p>to have a system that</p>
<p>would kind of, you</p>
<p>know, be sort of</p>
<p>egalitarian, sort of</p>
<p>treat all the sort</p>
<p>of mainstream sides</p>
<p>equally, and we</p>
<p>actually made a lot</p>
<p>of improvements on</p>
<p>this over the past</p>
<p>month, and we&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>more to share soon,</p>
<p>but, yeah, I think</p>
<p>that people were</p>
<p>right to criticize us,</p>
<p>and I think that we</p>
<p>really sort of, you</p>
<p>know, responded to</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>pieces of feedback</p>
<p>that I think is most</p>
<p>valuable.</p>
<p>Fill in the blank.</p>
<p>What do you think</p>
<p>the future of AI in</p>
<p>2050 is?</p>
<p>Unimaginable.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>The single most</p>
<p>important ethical issue</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re facing when it</p>
<p>comes to the future</p>
<p>of AI in humans.</p>
<p>This one&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>whole package,</p>
<p>honestly.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>question of how the</p>
<p>values get in there,</p>
<p>whose values get in</p>
<p>there, who&rsquo;s values</p>
<p>get in there, and</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s values don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get in there, and</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s values don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get in there, and</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s values don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get in there, and</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s values don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get in there, and</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s benefits get</p>
<p>in there, and who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>benefits get in</p>
<p>there, and who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>benefits get in</p>
<p>there, and who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>benefits get</p>
<p>distributed.</p>
<p>How do you make</p>
<p>sure the technology</p>
<p>is safe and used in</p>
<p>the right ways and</p>
<p>the emergent risks</p>
<p>that are going to</p>
<p>appear at some point</p>
<p>with very capable</p>
<p>systems don&rsquo;t end up</p>
<p>overwhelming the</p>
<p>positives we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to get.</p>
<p>So I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>whole thing.</p>
<p>At some point to</p>
<p>your first question,</p>
<p>the sentience</p>
<p>question, at what</p>
<p>point do the</p>
<p>systems have moral</p>
<p>philosophers to</p>
<p>help answer some</p>
<p>of these questions?</p>
<p>Are you going to</p>
<p>hire philosophers?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>hire I think everyone</p>
<p>across the board.</p>
<p>I think this is</p>
<p>one key thing to get</p>
<p>across.</p>
<p>I think that within</p>
<p>AI I&rsquo;ve definitely</p>
<p>seen this fallacy of</p>
<p>people thinking this</p>
<p>is a technology</p>
<p>problem or just</p>
<p>saying look,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>alignment problem</p>
<p>of how do you</p>
<p>make the AI not</p>
<p>go off the rails,</p>
<p>but the society</p>
<p>thing, that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>hard part.</p>
<p>And I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>hard part.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to</p>
<p>worry about that.</p>
<p>And I think you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>I think that it</p>
<p>really has to be that</p>
<p>you engage with the</p>
<p>whole package and</p>
<p>that I think is going</p>
<p>to require everyone.</p>
<p>I like the</p>
<p>understanding of</p>
<p>understanding the</p>
<p>people behind the</p>
<p>code that transforms</p>
<p>society.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve just</p>
<p>met you in person</p>
<p>today, but we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>spoken a little bit</p>
<p>about some of the</p>
<p>ethical stuff too.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re at the helm</p>
<p>of one of the most</p>
<p>important technological</p>
<p>advances of our time.</p>
<p>What do you want</p>
<p>people here to know</p>
<p>about you?</p>
<p>Well, I love my</p>
<p>wife.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to</p>
<p>listen to the chat</p>
<p>bot.</p>
<p>I bet she is</p>
<p>fabulous.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not being</p>
<p>replaced.</p>
<p>Sidney cannot</p>
<p>break up that</p>
<p>marriage.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And we were</p>
<p>talking about this</p>
<p>last night.</p>
<p>She was asking</p>
<p>why do I do it?</p>
<p>Because I work a</p>
<p>lot.</p>
<p>I think we give</p>
<p>up a lot of time</p>
<p>together as a result</p>
<p>of just how much I</p>
<p>really try to focus</p>
<p>on the work and</p>
<p>trying to kind of</p>
<p>move the company</p>
<p>forward.</p>
<p>And, you know, I</p>
<p>hadn&rsquo;t really thought</p>
<p>about that question</p>
<p>for a while.</p>
<p>And I thought</p>
<p>about it, and my</p>
<p>true answer was</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>right thing to do.</p>
<p>Like, I just think</p>
<p>that this technology</p>
<p>really can help</p>
<p>everyone, can help</p>
<p>the world.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, you</p>
<p>know, these problems</p>
<p>that we just see</p>
<p>coming down the</p>
<p>pipe, you know,</p>
<p>climate change again</p>
<p>being one of them,</p>
<p>I think we have a</p>
<p>way out.</p>
<p>And if I can</p>
<p>move the needle on</p>
<p>that, and, you</p>
<p>know, I&rsquo;m grateful</p>
<p>to be in the</p>
<p>position that I am,</p>
<p>but honestly, when</p>
<p>we started the</p>
<p>company, what I</p>
<p>cared about most</p>
<p>was I was just like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to do</p>
<p>anything.</p>
<p>You know, like,</p>
<p>first day two people</p>
<p>were arguing about</p>
<p>something, they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have a white</p>
<p>board, I was like,</p>
<p>great, I&rsquo;ll go get</p>
<p>the white board.</p>
<p>And I think that</p>
<p>this problem is just</p>
<p>so important.</p>
<p>It transcends</p>
<p>each of us</p>
<p>individually.</p>
<p>It transcends our</p>
<p>own position in it.</p>
<p>And I think it is</p>
<p>really about trying</p>
<p>to get to that</p>
<p>good future.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Well, thank you.</p>
<p>So, I think we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about the</p>
<p>decline in human</p>
<p>intelligence as we</p>
<p>start to outsource</p>
<p>our cognition to</p>
<p>AI.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is</p>
<p>definitely something</p>
<p>that keeps me up at</p>
<p>night.</p>
<p>Although, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting to see</p>
<p>this trend across</p>
<p>all previous</p>
<p>technologies, you</p>
<p>know, radio,</p>
<p>television, you</p>
<p>know, I&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>to some esteemed</p>
<p>states people who</p>
<p>have said, like,</p>
<p>the politicians</p>
<p>these days, nothing</p>
<p>compared to</p>
<p>Teddy Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Like, read all of</p>
<p>Teddy Roosevelt&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great thoughts, and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so unclear to</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>Like, you know, I</p>
<p>feel, like, is this</p>
<p>true or is it not?</p>
<p>But I think that</p>
<p>what is definitely</p>
<p>important as we see</p>
<p>this new technology</p>
<p>coming is figuring</p>
<p>out how to have it</p>
<p>be an intelligence</p>
<p>multiplier, right?</p>
<p>So that, you know,</p>
<p>sometimes, yeah, you</p>
<p>do need to solve the</p>
<p>problem yourself, but</p>
<p>what you really want</p>
<p>is you want a great</p>
<p>tutor.</p>
<p>You want someone who</p>
<p>breaks down the</p>
<p>problem to you,</p>
<p>really understands</p>
<p>what motivates you,</p>
<p>and if you have a</p>
<p>different learning</p>
<p>style.</p>
<p>And so I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>But if you have</p>
<p>something that</p>
<p>actually is figuring</p>
<p>out the how do I</p>
<p>help you fish, or</p>
<p>how do I help you</p>
<p>learn to fish, I</p>
<p>think you can go way</p>
<p>further.</p>
<p>What is your opinion</p>
<p>on, this one was</p>
<p>upvoted a lot, so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being true to</p>
<p>the audience.</p>
<p>They have a good</p>
<p>question.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>What is your opinion</p>
<p>on intellectual</p>
<p>property rights for</p>
<p>AI-generated content</p>
<p>trained on the work</p>
<p>of a particular</p>
<p>artist?</p>
<p>We talked a little</p>
<p>bit about this, but</p>
<p>The people want more.</p>
<p>I think this is like</p>
<p>asking a question</p>
<p>about exactly how</p>
<p>copyright should work</p>
<p>right at the</p>
<p>creation of the</p>
<p>Gutenberg press,</p>
<p>right, where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like we are going to</p>
<p>need to have an</p>
<p>answer.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re engaging with</p>
<p>the copyright office.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re engaging with</p>
<p>lots of different</p>
<p>areas, and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>personally know what</p>
<p>exactly the answer</p>
<p>should be, but I do</p>
<p>think that, like, one</p>
<p>thing that I do want</p>
<p>to say, not to kind</p>
<p>of hedge everything</p>
<p>here, is that I do</p>
<p>think that content</p>
<p>creators should be</p>
<p>sort of, you know,</p>
<p>it should be a more</p>
<p>prestigious, a more</p>
<p>compensated, a more</p>
<p>just, like, good thing</p>
<p>for people to pursue</p>
<p>now than ever, and I</p>
<p>think if we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>achieve that in some</p>
<p>way, then I think</p>
<p>that something has</p>
<p>gone wrong.</p>
<p>Will there be new</p>
<p>laws that didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist?</p>
<p>Oh, for sure.</p>
<p>I mean, there should</p>
<p>be.</p>
<p>What do you think</p>
<p>they will be?</p>
<p>Well, again, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to speak out of</p>
<p>turn.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be</p>
<p>too, yeah, I just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to speak</p>
<p>out of turn on</p>
<p>these issues, but I</p>
<p>think that, to me,</p>
<p>the process that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening right now</p>
<p>is really important.</p>
<p>I think that, you</p>
<p>know, it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>important that, you</p>
<p>know, when we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about</p>
<p>things, people really</p>
<p>care, and they should,</p>
<p>and that we are</p>
<p>trying to figure out</p>
<p>mechanisms just</p>
<p>within our own, you</p>
<p>know, sort of, you</p>
<p>know, slice of how we</p>
<p>implement things and</p>
<p>how we sort of work</p>
<p>with different</p>
<p>partners.</p>
<p>You know, for</p>
<p>Dolly, for example,</p>
<p>the very first people</p>
<p>that we invited to</p>
<p>use it were artists,</p>
<p>right, because we</p>
<p>really wanted to figure</p>
<p>out how do we make</p>
<p>this be a tool that</p>
<p>you are excited about</p>
<p>and that you feel</p>
<p>like, yes, like, I</p>
<p>think that the most</p>
<p>important thing is</p>
<p>really going to be</p>
<p>these higher-level</p>
<p>skills, right,</p>
<p>judgment, really</p>
<p>figuring out is this</p>
<p>good, is this bad, do</p>
<p>I like this, do I</p>
<p>not, knowing when to</p>
<p>sort of, you know,</p>
<p>sort of dig more into</p>
<p>the details, and</p>
<p>really, I think today</p>
<p>just even playing with</p>
<p>these systems, like, I</p>
<p>think that it will be</p>
<p>the case that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to make, you</p>
<p>know, the next</p>
<p>generations of the</p>
<p>Dolly&rsquo;s and these</p>
<p>other systems just be,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even have</p>
<p>to, no language,</p>
<p>you know, you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even have to know</p>
<p>the language, you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even have to</p>
<p>know the language,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even have to</p>
<p>know the language,</p>
<p>right, they should</p>
<p>become much more</p>
<p>child-accessible, and I</p>
<p>think that children</p>
<p>being sort of AI native</p>
<p>users, I think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to find that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to figure</p>
<p>out how to just use</p>
<p>these in totally</p>
<p>unimaginable ways.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>Sorry, this one&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>working, I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>this one.</p>
<p>Okay, how can we</p>
<p>maintain the integrity</p>
<p>of AI models like</p>
<p>ChatGPT when capital</p>
<p>from corporates has</p>
<p>entered the space</p>
<p>monetizing a tool run</p>
<p>by a nonprofit, and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve, I mean, a lot</p>
<p>of folks, this is,</p>
<p>actually, this is what</p>
<p>I was going to ask</p>
<p>you, but ChatGPT</p>
<p>also asked me to ask</p>
<p>you, which is</p>
<p>interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very topical.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>This is good.</p>
<p>And so if you could</p>
<p>give us a little more</p>
<p>insight, because</p>
<p>obviously we&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>far from when you</p>
<p>guys sat at that</p>
<p>dinner and said we</p>
<p>want to change</p>
<p>things, and now</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s money, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>profit, there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these other things, so</p>
<p>how do you guys</p>
<p>maintain that?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Well, I think that</p>
<p>our answer to this</p>
<p>question, and you</p>
<p>should hold us</p>
<p>accountable, by the</p>
<p>way, is really about</p>
<p>the fact that we</p>
<p>really set up our</p>
<p>structure in a very</p>
<p>specific way, which,</p>
<p>by the way, has</p>
<p>turned off a lot of</p>
<p>investors.</p>
<p>We have this big</p>
<p>purple box at the</p>
<p>top of all of our</p>
<p>investment docs that</p>
<p>say the mission comes</p>
<p>first, that we may</p>
<p>have to, you know,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a conflict</p>
<p>with achieving the</p>
<p>mission, cancel all</p>
<p>of your profit</p>
<p>interests, which,</p>
<p>yeah, you know,</p>
<p>sends many traditional</p>
<p>investors running for</p>
<p>the hills, and I</p>
<p>think that, you know,</p>
<p>like, there&rsquo;s a part</p>
<p>of the frame of the</p>
<p>question that I, you</p>
<p>know, sort of don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>agree with, which is</p>
<p>that the existence of</p>
<p>capital is itself a</p>
<p>problem.</p>
<p>Like, I think that,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>using iPhones, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using TVs created by</p>
<p>companies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of good</p>
<p>things, but I do think</p>
<p>it comes with great</p>
<p>incentives, right?</p>
<p>It comes with this</p>
<p>pressure to, you</p>
<p>know, sort of do</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s good for you</p>
<p>specifically, but not</p>
<p>necessarily for the</p>
<p>rest of society, not</p>
<p>to internalize those</p>
<p>externalities.</p>
<p>And so I think that</p>
<p>the important thing for</p>
<p>us has been to really</p>
<p>figure out how do you</p>
<p>set up the incentives</p>
<p>that are on yourself so</p>
<p>that you do, as much</p>
<p>as possible, get</p>
<p>the, you know, the</p>
<p>best people to join,</p>
<p>you can build the</p>
<p>massive supercomputers,</p>
<p>you can actually build</p>
<p>these tools and get</p>
<p>them out there.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>if you do succeed</p>
<p>massively and wildly</p>
<p>beyond anything that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happened, how do you</p>
<p>make sure that you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t, you know, once</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve kind of gotten</p>
<p>to everything, you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to then 2x</p>
<p>everything, you know?</p>
<p>And I think that these</p>
<p>kinds of very subtle</p>
<p>choices make a huge</p>
<p>difference in terms of</p>
<p>outcome.</p>
<p>I want to end with a</p>
<p>quote from your</p>
<p>co-founder Sam</p>
<p>Altman.</p>
<p>He wrote, a misaligned</p>
<p>super intelligent AGI</p>
<p>could lead to</p>
<p>serious harm to the</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>An autocratic regime</p>
<p>with a super intelligence</p>
<p>could lead to that,</p>
<p>too.</p>
<p>Successfully</p>
<p>transitioning to a world</p>
<p>where super intelligence</p>
<p>is perhaps the most</p>
<p>important and hopeful</p>
<p>and scary project in</p>
<p>human, is perhaps the</p>
<p>most, sorry, I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>messing this up, is the</p>
<p>most important, hopeful</p>
<p>and scary project in</p>
<p>human history.</p>
<p>Success is far from</p>
<p>guaranteed and the</p>
<p>stakes, boundless</p>
<p>downside and boundless</p>
<p>upside, are there to</p>
<p>hopefully unite us</p>
<p>all.</p>
<p>I want to end</p>
<p>with a quote from</p>
<p>the great guy Sam</p>
<p>Altman, who&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>artist, a philosopher,</p>
<p>a Î¥âÏùÑ ÌÉÑÏÉùÌïòÍ≥†</p>
<p>40ÌóàÎ¶¨ Ïó¥ÌíçÏùÑ</p>
<p>I think that this is</p>
<p>the key.</p>
<p>And I think by engaging</p>
<p>in these technologies</p>
<p>we have to study</p>
<p>these questions</p>
<p>and not know the</p>
<p>answers yet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>responsibility not just</p>
<p>of us but of everyone</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a</p>
<p>project of decades</p>
<p>to really go from</p>
<p>where we are to the</p>
<p>kinds of systems that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>And all along the way</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>surprising things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>great things that</p>
<p>happen.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>causes for joy,</p>
<p>causes for grief.</p>
<p>And I think that they</p>
<p>all happen in small</p>
<p>ways now.</p>
<p>And I think in the</p>
<p>future maybe they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>happen in bigger and</p>
<p>bigger ways.</p>
<p>And I think that just</p>
<p>really engaging with</p>
<p>this process, just</p>
<p>really everyone</p>
<p>educating themselves</p>
<p>as much as possible</p>
<p>and figuring out how</p>
<p>can this fit in.</p>
<p>I love the question</p>
<p>about what should I</p>
<p>teach my one-year-old</p>
<p>because that is a hope</p>
<p>for the future kind of</p>
<p>question.</p>
<p>And I think that I am</p>
<p>very optimistic.</p>
<p>Again, I think I</p>
<p>consider myself this</p>
<p>realistic optimist that</p>
<p>you really have to be</p>
<p>calibrated.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just blindly</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s all going to</p>
<p>work out but you have</p>
<p>to engage with all the</p>
<p>problems.</p>
<p>But I think it is</p>
<p>possible that we will</p>
<p>end up in this world</p>
<p>of abundance and sort</p>
<p>of the real good</p>
<p>future.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>possible that we</p>
<p>will end up in this</p>
<p>world of abundance and</p>
<p>sort of the real good</p>
<p>future.</p>
<p>I think it won&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>perfect.</p>
<p>I think there will be</p>
<p>problems.</p>
<p>And there will certainly</p>
<p>be many problems along</p>
<p>the way.</p>
<p>But I think we can</p>
<p>rise to the occasion.</p>
<p>You have children?</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>Working on convincing</p>
<p>my wife though.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I was going to</p>
<p>say, do you believe</p>
<p>that kids of your</p>
<p>friends, if you end up</p>
<p>having children, will</p>
<p>grow up in a better</p>
<p>world?</p>
<p>I do think so.</p>
<p>I think we have a</p>
<p>shot at it.</p>
<p>And I think the moment</p>
<p>you think that it is,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when things go</p>
<p>wrong.</p>
<p>And so I think we all</p>
<p>have to be sort of</p>
<p>constantly asking what</p>
<p>can go wrong and what</p>
<p>can we do to prevent</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Greg Ruckman, thank</p>
<p>you so much.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks, guys.</p>
<p>Appreciate it</p>
