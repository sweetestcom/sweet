    <p>Our card this week is Selene Eadie, the Three of Diamonds from South Carolina.</p>
<p>Selene Eadie was a friendly 15-year-old girl whose budding teenage years were cut horrifically</p>
<p>short in the spring of 2004.</p>
<p>Law enforcement investigators in Columbia, South Carolina have been trying to solve this</p>
<p>case for 18 years.</p>
<p>So to help us understand the ins and outs of this story and learn more about what happened</p>
<p>Detectives took our reporter, Emily, to the scene of the crime, which means we&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>you there in this episode as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>It was still light outside at 730 at night on Thursday, April 15th, 2004 in Columbia,</p>
<p>South Carolina, when Brenda McCoy heard her neighbor, Veronica, yell from across the street,</p>
<p>Veronica was having a cookout across the road when she saw Brenda&rsquo;s teenage daughter, Selene</p>
<p>Eadie, leave the house.</p>
<p>So to help keep Brenda in the loop, Veronica shouted across the road to inform her what</p>
<p>was going on.</p>
<p>At the time, Veronica knew Brenda had been having some trouble with Selene.</p>
<p>Brenda had mentioned a few times that Selene had been acting out, not coming home on time,</p>
<p>leaving without permission, things like that.</p>
<p>Spring of 2004 was just a tough time overall for everyone in the family.</p>
<p>Brenda was a widow whose husband, Fred, had died 10 years earlier, and she&rsquo;d been trying</p>
<p>her best to be a good mother of three.</p>
<p>Her children were all adopted or in the process of being adopted, and that included 15-year-old</p>
<p>Selene and Selene&rsquo;s 11-year-old brother and 4-year-old sister.</p>
<p>Selene had been with Brenda for 12 years, so most of her life, and her little sister</p>
<p>was in the process of coming into Brenda&rsquo;s home full-time in April of 2004.</p>
<p>Being the oldest of three, going through the thick of her teenage years, and still grieving</p>
<p>the loss of her adoptive father really took a toll on Selene, and that&rsquo;s why she began</p>
<p>acting out.</p>
<p>Senior cold case detective for the Richland County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, Dottie Cronice,</p>
<p>said Brenda had been trying to be helpful and supportive of her daughter, who was obviously</p>
<p>struggling.</p>
<p>Selene was adopted by Brenda McCoy, and I believe it was Frederick Eady, and he died</p>
<p>when I believe Selene was about five, and that had, from all accounts, a devastating</p>
<p>effect on Selene.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how often she tried to find her original birth family, but that seemed to</p>
<p>be a concern to her.</p>
<p>That was noted as possibly being cause for some of the troubles she was having and the</p>
<p>difficulties, but losing him, she was just so attached to him that, you know, I guess</p>
<p>you go through feelings of abandonment, is the only thing I can equate it to.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s at five, and he&rsquo;s gone, and he&rsquo;s not coming back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure Ms. McCoy did what she could do to help her through that, but Selene was her</p>
<p>own person.</p>
<p>Sometimes Selene&rsquo;s behaviors went a little beyond just typical teenage angst and desire</p>
<p>for independence, though.</p>
<p>In fact, according to police records, Selene had actually run away two weeks before the</p>
<p>night of April 15th, when her neighbor caught her.</p>
<p>That incident had scared Brenda so much that she&rsquo;d contacted the police and filed a missing</p>
<p>persons report.</p>
<p>That time, Brenda had dropped Selene off at a shoe store in town, but when she came back</p>
<p>to get her, Selene was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>At the time, Brenda told police that she&rsquo;d come to the Columbia Police Department and</p>
<p>reported her daughter as a runaway because she thought that maybe the cops sitting down</p>
<p>and intervening could make the teen realize she had to stop taking off, kind of a put</p>
<p>the fear of God in her type of thing.</p>
<p>Eventually, Selene did return home on her own hours later, and the whole reporting the</p>
<p>incident to the police didn&rsquo;t have much of an impact on her.</p>
<p>So fast forward to April 15th, when Veronica caught a glimpse of the teen sneaking out</p>
<p>of her family&rsquo;s home, she decided to confront her.</p>
<p>Veronica yelled towards Selene to ask her where she was going, and she responded by</p>
<p>just sort of brushing it off and saying she wasn&rsquo;t going anywhere.</p>
<p>Next thing Veronica and Brenda knew, Selene was gone.</p>
<p>Brenda even tried to jog up the street to catch up with her daughter, but she was already</p>
<p>too far ahead.</p>
<p>Like I said, Selene running off wasn&rsquo;t that unheard of for the family, so Brenda tried</p>
<p>not to worry at first.</p>
<p>She thought that her daughter would just come home like she always did later that night.</p>
<p>Brenda had told police in previous runaway reports that Selene was overly friendly to</p>
<p>strangers and too trusting of people she barely knew.</p>
<p>The scary thing was that she would, you know, if she wanted to go into town, she&rsquo;d take</p>
<p>a ride from anybody.</p>
<p>And that, I think, probably scared her family and her friends more than anything else.</p>
<p>Being 15 has its own aggravations, and that was something her mom said, too, is she never</p>
<p>took into account that mom used to be 15, and she, you know, you just don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>I used to be 15, too, and I know what you&rsquo;re going through.</p>
<p>And she would just, Selene did not like anybody getting in her face and just would walk off.</p>
<p>Like a lot of 15-year-olds think that parents don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Now, quick sidebar on Detective Dottie Cronise.</p>
<p>Like the bird that flies, it&rsquo;s a nice day, crow, nice.</p>
<p>Dottie isn&rsquo;t your average cop.</p>
<p>The 68-year-old has been a detective since the 1970s.</p>
<p>I graduated from University of South Carolina in 1974, August 17th.</p>
<p>August 25th of 1974, I started to work here at Richland County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office and</p>
<p>was put in juvenile investigations.</p>
<p>Despite working thousands of cases in her career, Dottie can rattle off dates, times</p>
<p>and details from memory like it&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>She talks about each murder case like it&rsquo;s her only priority.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s someone who befriends victims&rsquo; families and shows up to candlelight vigils wearing</p>
<p>a t-shirt the family made to raise awareness about their loved one&rsquo;s unsolved case.</p>
<p>Talking with Dottie is like talking with an old friend, even though she doesn&rsquo;t always</p>
<p>love doing media interviews.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell you a little more about Dottie, because if you become a regular listener of</p>
<p>The Deck, which hopefully you do, you&rsquo;re going to hear her featured a few times on</p>
<p>the show talking about a couple of different unsolved cases in Columbia.</p>
<p>Even though she doesn&rsquo;t jump at the chance to do sit-down interviews, Dottie loves people.</p>
<p>And she knows that talking about cases, especially cold cases, is one of the keys to solving</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad, but when you can actually bring some resolution, that kind of gives you the</p>
<p>motivation to keep going.</p>
<p>Like Dottie said a second ago, Selene didn&rsquo;t hesitate to take a ride from someone if they</p>
<p>had a familiar face, like someone she knew from the neighborhood.</p>
<p>She had no problem asking them for a ride.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know if this is something that Selene did the night she took off from her</p>
<p>family&rsquo;s house, but what investigators did know for sure is that after Selene walked</p>
<p>away that Thursday night in mid-April, Brenda went back inside after just a few minutes</p>
<p>and waited.</p>
<p>Night turned into the next morning, and Selene still had not come home.</p>
<p>Two more nights went by, and there was still no sign of her.</p>
<p>Because Selene had that previous history as a runaway, Brenda decided not to call the</p>
<p>police this time.</p>
<p>She was holding out hope that Selene would just show back up.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not like she did nothing.</p>
<p>Instead of calling 911, Brenda started calling around to people she thought were her daughter&rsquo;s</p>
<p>friends, and touching base with other family members to ask if anyone had seen or heard</p>
<p>from Selene.</p>
<p>But they hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>After those two days came and went, it was the weekend, and Brenda was full of dread,</p>
<p>but still trying to stay hopeful.</p>
<p>But any glimmer of hope that Selene would return home unharmed was dashed when county</p>
<p>firefighters made a grisly discovery on that Saturday morning.</p>
<p>That Saturday, a person driving on the outskirts of town noticed a small brush fire burning</p>
<p>in a wooded area.</p>
<p>On Saturday morning, April 17, 2004, around ten after five, there&rsquo;s a phone call to the</p>
<p>fire department that there&rsquo;s a fire at the intersection of Pincushion and Montgomery</p>
<p>on the lower side of Richland County.</p>
<p>The fire department responded.</p>
<p>They said the blaze was about 40 feet in diameter.</p>
<p>And they went in, got the blaze out, but as they put the blaze out, they noticed there</p>
<p>was a body in the center.</p>
<p>That body was lying face down in the woods and had been badly burned.</p>
<p>Firefighters didn&rsquo;t immediately recognize who it was, but from what they saw of the</p>
<p>remains, they could tell that it was likely a girl or woman.</p>
<p>Right before 6 a.m., firefighters called for sheriff&rsquo;s deputies to respond to the scene</p>
<p>and take over.</p>
<p>When detectives arrived, they processed the area and transported the body to the local</p>
<p>medical examiner&rsquo;s office for an autopsy.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where science and the record keeping really make a huge difference in this case.</p>
<p>The ME had no way of really identifying the body just by looking at it.</p>
<p>The fire had inflicted too much damage.</p>
<p>All they could say was that it appeared that in addition to being set on fire, whoever</p>
<p>it was had also been severely beaten.</p>
<p>Some reports indicate that there was soot found in the person&rsquo;s lungs, which indicated</p>
<p>that they may have still been alive when they were set on fire, but the ME couldn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>that determination for sure.</p>
<p>Today, law enforcement still is not sure of that fact.</p>
<p>But remember that missing persons report I told you about earlier?</p>
<p>The one Brenda had filed with the Columbia Police Department when Selene ran away from</p>
<p>that shoe store?</p>
<p>Well, that report was still in law enforcement&rsquo;s system on April 17th.</p>
<p>It had never been properly cleared after Selene had returned home safely two weeks prior.</p>
<p>Thankfully, that report included Selene&rsquo;s description and some identifying marks and</p>
<p>features.</p>
<p>When the ME compared the charred remains to cases of missing persons from the area, the</p>
<p>information in Selene&rsquo;s report stood out.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Dottie again to explain.</p>
<p>They had the information about Selene being a missing person.</p>
<p>So they were able to, I think, recognize some of the clothing and what all that she was</p>
<p>wearing or supposedly seen last in.</p>
<p>And they got her dental records and through the dental records, they were able to identify</p>
<p>the burned body as that of Selene.</p>
<p>Within a few hours of that discovery, Brenda was asked to come in and identify the body</p>
<p>to help law enforcement clarify, once and for all, that the remains did in fact belong</p>
<p>to Selene.</p>
<p>A necklace her daughter wore with a charm of a shoe on it helped her know for sure.</p>
<p>Dottie said that Brenda was devastated, completely heartbroken, and had a hard time comprehending</p>
<p>why someone would do something so awful to her little girl.</p>
<p>So much of what I have read on her, it talks about Ms. McCoy as being her adoptive mother.</p>
<p>Adopted or not, she was mom and mom loved her daughter and lost her.</p>
<p>You have a child, but in this case, she chose this child.</p>
<p>And there had to be something very special about Selene at the age of three that made</p>
<p>her choose this little girl.</p>
<p>And if she was as happy and spirited at three as she grew up to be, I can see why.</p>
<p>Always that big smile, just glad to be there.</p>
<p>And obviously had a close relationship with dad.</p>
<p>During her interview with us, Dottie brought out her favorite pictures of Selene, which</p>
<p>are still in the Richland County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office case file.</p>
<p>You can see some of them on our website, thedeckpodcast.com.</p>
<p>In one, Selene is wearing an oversized jacket and hat, leaning over and smiling at the camera.</p>
<p>Selene was just a happy 15-year-old little girl.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen the picture of her there in her red coat and kneeling down on the ground.</p>
<p>Her smile just captivates you and she just looks ready for life.</p>
<p>This picture of when she was young is just so pretty.</p>
<p>She just looks so cute in that.</p>
<p>Do you know who took this picture?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yeah, her personality really shows through in this one.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m cute and I know it.</p>
<p>Yeah, she just looks like a little girl.</p>
<p>In the days after Selene&rsquo;s murder, Brenda told several local media outlets something</p>
<p>that made police highly suspicious that Selene&rsquo;s killer could have been a Columbia local.</p>
<p>Brenda was quoted by a few publications stating that Selene had started wearing nothing but</p>
<p>red and black clothing, colors associated with a local street gang.</p>
<p>Brenda had become worried that Selene had possibly gotten mixed up with the wrong group</p>
<p>of friends and was getting into a dangerous crowd.</p>
<p>She said she talked with her daughter about this a few times and tried desperately to</p>
<p>intervene and steer Selene back onto a straight path, but nothing worked.</p>
<p>Selene ended up having to move high schools.</p>
<p>And at the time she was killed, she was enrolled in doing well at an alternative high school.</p>
<p>Police started their investigation into her murder by talking with teachers at that school</p>
<p>and trying to crack into Selene&rsquo;s friend group, but everyone detectives spoke with</p>
<p>had little information to provide, not because they were unwilling, but mostly because they</p>
<p>were just shocked.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t think of anyone who knew Selene that was capable of such a violent murder.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t understand, I think their reaction was more that of shock.</p>
<p>How does this happen to a 15 year old girl in our neighborhood?</p>
<p>How does that even take place?</p>
<p>Police began to theorize that whoever Selene was hanging out with and whoever killed her</p>
<p>likely had some kind of power over her.</p>
<p>They could have been older than her and heavily influencing her actions and attitude.</p>
<p>A sheriff&rsquo;s office investigator at the time told WISTV, quote,</p>
<p>She was a child that had a lot of problems.</p>
<p>She was searching for a lot of comfort in the wrong places, in the wrong people.</p>
<p>People took advantage of her, end quote.</p>
<p>The more police looked into Selene&rsquo;s life in the days leading up to her murder, the</p>
<p>more leads they came across that they had to chase down.</p>
<p>Detectives interviewed a ton of people and pulled the call logs from Brenda&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>to see what numbers Selene had dialed and if anyone had called her.</p>
<p>The teen had a pretty robust social life, so there had been dozens of calls to and from</p>
<p>different friends all routed through the home&rsquo;s landline.</p>
<p>Law enforcement didn&rsquo;t indicate to us in our interview that Selene had a cell phone,</p>
<p>but this was 2004, it&rsquo;s definitely possible she had one.</p>
<p>But if she did, no one knew about it.</p>
<p>Not her mother, not her friends, no one.</p>
<p>After days of sorting through the home&rsquo;s call history and interviewing all of Selene&rsquo;s</p>
<p>known friends and acquaintances, detectives were trying desperately to find a very specific</p>
<p>type of caller, someone who might have had a romantic interest in Selene.</p>
<p>They thought maybe if there was a significant other person in Selene&rsquo;s life, that person</p>
<p>could help shed more light on the situation, but that just didn&rsquo;t pan out.</p>
<p>Based on everyone they interviewed, Selene didn&rsquo;t have a crush or any kind of romantic</p>
<p>interest at the time of her death.</p>
<p>There were no reports of her sneaking off with an older guy or girl or telling any of</p>
<p>her friends that she was leaving to be with someone.</p>
<p>So the next and most logical place investigators were left to turn to was the location where</p>
<p>Selene&rsquo;s body had been found.</p>
<p>The spot is what locals refer to as the lower side of Richland County, a rural area by some</p>
<p>railroad tracks.</p>
<p>Dottie, and another cold case detective in Richland County named Larry Ganey, took Emily</p>
<p>to the old crime scene last summer.</p>
<p>The exact spot that Selene&rsquo;s charred remains were found back in 2004 is walking distance</p>
<p>into the woods from a paved country road.</p>
<p>The one critical thing that both Dottie and Larry agree on is that the spot would be really</p>
<p>hard to find unless you&rsquo;re someone who&rsquo;s super familiar with the area.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually one of the reasons they volunteered to drive our reporter Emily to the area.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t think that she could find it on her own.</p>
<p>The area there at Montgomery and Pencushion, it&rsquo;s rural.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got a train track running through there.</p>
<p>The houses in that area are far apart.</p>
<p>On a Saturday morning, you&rsquo;re not going to have much traffic at all because there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to be anybody going to work, you know, five o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>The trees are dense, and after just a few hundred yards of walking in the brush, Emily,</p>
<p>Larry, and Dottie arrived.</p>
<p>See that where those things are?</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be approximately where it was.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So has this always been pretty wooded like this?</p>
<p>It was even back then.</p>
<p>Emily took some photos of the site that you can see on our website.</p>
<p>When I looked at them, it&rsquo;s pretty clear that it would be really easy to start a fire in</p>
<p>the area.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s dry brush and trees everywhere, and according to Dottie, it looks pretty much</p>
<p>exactly how it did when Selene was killed.</p>
<p>Right next to the closest intersection that borders the woods where Selene was found is</p>
<p>an old, overgrown logging road.</p>
<p>Larry pointed out the small access road, and he believes that path could have aided Selene&rsquo;s</p>
<p>killer or killers.</p>
<p>They would have been able to use the logging road to get in and out of the area fairly</p>
<p>undetected.</p>
<p>The road used to go like up through here.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It went back towards where her body was.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it was like two ruts, and you can only see them from the crime scene photographs.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, you couldn&rsquo;t tell it today.</p>
<p>Dottie has theorized that it&rsquo;s possible the moon might have been full the night Selene</p>
<p>was killed.</p>
<p>She says that in that part of Columbia, if the moon was bright enough, the logging road</p>
<p>might have been lit up for the suspect.</p>
<p>If it was dark though, the killer would have had to bring their own light or use headlights</p>
<p>to get them back to where Selene was dumped.</p>
<p>Either that, or once again, the suspect knew the area so well, they didn&rsquo;t need anything</p>
<p>to help them with their sense of direction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very secluded.</p>
<p>The chances of somebody just driving by and seeing somebody, it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>And it may be that somebody did and didn&rsquo;t think anything about it at the time.</p>
<p>And they may even have recognized the vehicle, or who was in it, but just discounted it.</p>
<p>But that area is woods, it&rsquo;s country, and you kind of almost need to know your way around</p>
<p>to get back in there.</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re riding around, look, there&rsquo;s really no houses right here.</p>
<p>So then if you do it late enough at night, you&hellip;</p>
<p>And then Saturday morning, nobody&rsquo;s going to find you.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>The remote nature of the area where Selene was left, and the fact that whoever killed</p>
<p>her wanted to make sure she wouldn&rsquo;t live to tell about what had happened to her, are</p>
<p>two big reasons why her mother Brenda always believed the killer was someone her daughter</p>
<p>knew.</p>
<p>And to this day, investigators still agree with that theory.</p>
<p>We are still looking at that time span between 7.30 that Thursday night and 5 a.m. Saturday</p>
<p>morning, and what happened and who she was with.</p>
<p>And we are getting tips about that.</p>
<p>That is still coming into play.</p>
<p>Over the years, detectives like Dottie wanted so badly to find Selene&rsquo;s killer and give</p>
<p>Brenda closure, but unfortunately, time ran out.</p>
<p>Her mom, Brenda McCoy, in one of her interviews made the statement that she really wanted</p>
<p>this to get solved.</p>
<p>I maybe did before that happens, is what she said.</p>
<p>And sadly, she passed away April 30th of 2020.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it just makes you sad to think that that mom never got to confront</p>
<p>the person that took her daughter from her.</p>
<p>And in such a horrific way.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>You know, what brought them to a point of beating and burning?</p>
<p>What was the aggravation?</p>
<p>What was the aggravating factor there?</p>
<p>Those are critical questions.</p>
<p>Who would have the ability to do such horrific things to a 15 year old?</p>
<p>And more importantly, why?</p>
<p>Usually when there&rsquo;s a fire at a scene or a body has been badly burned, investigators</p>
<p>barely have any evidence to work off of because the flames destroy so much of the scene.</p>
<p>But Dottie says that&rsquo;s actually not the case here.</p>
<p>Back in 2004, forensic techs were able to pull enough evidence from the crime scene</p>
<p>so that when they do get their suspect, there won&rsquo;t be any doubt.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to be.</p>
<p>They were able to get some good forensics off of it.</p>
<p>So I think, again, corroborating and validating.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think the fire is going to make a difference one way or the other.</p>
<p>Dottie wouldn&rsquo;t go into too much detail, but she said confidently that Richland County</p>
<p>is the closest they have ever been to solving the case.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s thanks to forensic advances and useful tips that have found their way</p>
<p>onto investigators&rsquo; desks.</p>
<p>They trickle in, but the last few that we&rsquo;ve gotten have been usable.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying is those kinds of things really add up.</p>
<p>When you look at tips from five years ago and then you get this one that makes this</p>
<p>one look reasonable.</p>
<p>And as I said, you&rsquo;re corroborating and putting it together, which is why hopefully, you know,</p>
<p>someone in the community that knew Selene, that hung around with her.</p>
<p>She had so many friends in so many different places.</p>
<p>Again, she was just a very outgoing, friendly child.</p>
<p>And that was, I think, part of the problem in the original investigation was she knew</p>
<p>so many people trying to get a hold of all these people.</p>
<p>Somebody out there knows something.</p>
<p>They may not even realize that they know it.</p>
<p>Or they may suspect, my buddy over here, he&rsquo;s talked about this a lot, or he seems to maybe</p>
<p>know a little more than he should, but yet they don&rsquo;t really want to believe that their</p>
<p>buddy could ever have done something like this.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t come forward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that these folks will come forward and at least give us the opportunity to rule</p>
<p>it in or rule it out.</p>
<p>What bothers Dottie the most is knowing that Brenda McCoy died without answers.</p>
<p>Before she passed, Brenda told the state newspaper that not knowing and all of the unanswered</p>
<p>questions were killing her.</p>
<p>She said, quote, it&rsquo;s never going to be easier because I don&rsquo;t know what happened.</p>
<p>Now, if I find out what happened, then I can kind of rest my mind, end quote.</p>
<p>You would like to think that when you have a child that&rsquo;s murdered, that you do eventually</p>
<p>get to confront the perpetrator.</p>
<p>And she never had that opportunity.</p>
<p>And this case is solvable.</p>
<p>We just need a few more pieces.</p>
<p>If you have any information about Celine Eady&rsquo;s murder, Dottie urges you to come forward.</p>
<p>Crime Stoppers in South Carolina still has a $1,000 reward available for information</p>
<p>that leads to a suspect&rsquo;s conviction.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t sit home thinking, gosh, I don&rsquo;t really want to bother him with that.</p>
<p>This is silly.</p>
<p>No, pick up the phone, call us.</p>
<p>We would be much more thankful if you called us than if you didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I have a lot of faith in our people here, our citizens, that they&rsquo;ll come forward.</p>
<p>Something will happen and they will come forward.</p>
<p>Either they&rsquo;ve grown up and they&rsquo;ve got a daughter now that&rsquo;s 15 or a grandchild that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>15.</p>
<p>And think about Celine and remember something that they heard or they saw that gave them</p>
<p>a little concern back then that they didn&rsquo;t want to say anything, that maybe they&rsquo;ll say</p>
<p>something now.</p>
<p>Celine Eady, no matter how misguided her teen years were, did not deserve to die.</p>
<p>She deserved to figure out her life like we all do and have a future.</p>
<p>She deserved to go to beauty school and become a hairdresser, which she told her friends</p>
<p>and teachers was one of her goals.</p>
<p>And her mother, Brenda, didn&rsquo;t deserve to die not knowing what happened to her daughter.</p>
<p>If you know anything about this horrific killing, it&rsquo;s time to talk.</p>
<p>Call Dottie at the Richland County Cold Case Unit.</p>
<p>Help bring the person or people who viciously killed a sweet 15-year-old girl to justice.</p>
<p>It is long overdue.</p>
