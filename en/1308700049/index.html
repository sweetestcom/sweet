    <p>Our card this week is Donna Ingersoll, the Ten of Clubs from Minnesota.</p>
<p>On a snowy December night in 1990, 25-year-old Donna stormed outside and disappeared into</p>
<p>the night after a heated argument with her boyfriend,</p>
<p>leaving behind several important belongings and a twisted web of mysteries that investigators</p>
<p>have spent decades trying to untangle.</p>
<p>But some recent developments have present-day investigators questioning everything they</p>
<p>thought they knew about the case, and believing that they&rsquo;re closer than ever to cracking</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>It was 2012, and Jim Warren had just been appointed police chief of Wabasha, a rural</p>
<p>Minnesota city hugging the Mississippi River and the Wisconsin border.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tiny community, like population 2,500, ripe with small-town charm where everyone</p>
<p>knows each other.</p>
<p>And aside from some issues with drug crimes and petty theft, not much ever goes wrong.</p>
<p>Except for one cold night in 1990, when one of its residents vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s name was Donna, and her case had been haunting Chief Warren for years.</p>
<p>He actually reviewed the case back when he was a detective in 2006, helping the then-police</p>
<p>chief get Donna&rsquo;s story on social media.</p>
<p>And the details of her case stuck with him.</p>
<p>So much so that, now that he was chief, one of his first priorities was doing everything</p>
<p>he could to warm up Donna&rsquo;s hopelessly cold case.</p>
<p>But before making any investigative steps, Chief Warren wanted to form a cold case board</p>
<p>to go over the two decades&rsquo; worth of records and documents with a fine-toothed comb.</p>
<p>Not only to familiarize themselves with the case, but also to see if the initial investigators</p>
<p>missed anything, or if there was something they could poke holes in.</p>
<p>This was the timeline that they sorted out.</p>
<p>Right around 11.45 p.m. on December 16, 1990, the Wabasha County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office got</p>
<p>a call from a 33-year-old man named Gary Murphy, who said that his girlfriend Donna was missing.</p>
<p>He said that they&rsquo;d gotten into an argument an hour or so prior during a get-together</p>
<p>at a friend&rsquo;s house in downtown Wabasha.</p>
<p>He said that she got so mad that she stormed outside into the cold and snow, leaving behind</p>
<p>her car and purse.</p>
<p>And she hadn&rsquo;t come back.</p>
<p>Police reports didn&rsquo;t make it seem like there was a sense of urgency about her disappearance yet.</p>
<p>After all, Donna was 25 years old.</p>
<p>She could simply not return after an argument if she wanted to.</p>
<p>Chief Warren told our reporting team that since Gary didn&rsquo;t mention anything about</p>
<p>finding signs of foul play, authorities probably wanted to wait it out, and to see if she would</p>
<p>come back.</p>
<p>Back then, it was common if you called in and said, hey, we have someone missing.</p>
<p>Well, technically, if you&rsquo;re an adult, you can be missing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s on how the caller states what kind of issues they&rsquo;re dealing with.</p>
<p>But Gary ended up calling again, about 15 minutes later, around midnight.</p>
<p>And this time, a deputy responded to the friend&rsquo;s house to see if they could find any signs</p>
<p>of foul play or anything worrisome.</p>
<p>Just like Gary had said, they found Donna&rsquo;s car sitting in the driveway, her purse still</p>
<p>inside of it.</p>
<p>But those weren&rsquo;t the only things that Donna had left behind.</p>
<p>Gary also handed the deputy a lens that he said was from Donna&rsquo;s eyeglasses, like just</p>
<p>one lens.</p>
<p>The deputy asked Gary why just the one lens, and Gary said it must have fallen out.</p>
<p>And right away, this probably should have been pretty concerning, because it either</p>
<p>meant that Donna was out in the freezing, snowy night without full use of her glasses,</p>
<p>or maybe without them entirely.</p>
<p>And I know that she probably wouldn&rsquo;t want to be far away from them for too long.</p>
<p>I think she could make out objects and stuff like that, and she could make her way, but</p>
<p>I mean, she could still see, but not well.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know how glasses worked in 1990, but to me, this is also a sign that maybe</p>
<p>something bad happened.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t see lenses just falling out randomly, but for some reason, the fact that</p>
<p>there was only one lens, and the fact that many of Donna&rsquo;s most important belongings</p>
<p>were left behind, didn&rsquo;t raise any red flags for the deputy.</p>
<p>He seemed to think that Donna was probably fine and would just return on her own.</p>
<p>But night turned to morning, and still there was no sign of her.</p>
<p>So Gary called the sheriff&rsquo;s office yet again.</p>
<p>The police reports from the time make it seem like authorities still wanted to wait</p>
<p>it out a little bit longer before launching an investigation.</p>
<p>Even as Monday faded into Tuesday, many people still weren&rsquo;t too concerned.</p>
<p>They figured she&rsquo;d just gone to one of the nearby stores or a downtown bar.</p>
<p>But there might actually be a possible reason that so many people, including law enforcement,</p>
<p>thought this.</p>
<p>It was known that she&rsquo;d do that.</p>
<p>And family members said there was times where she&rsquo;d get mad and you wouldn&rsquo;t hear from her</p>
<p>for a day or two.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d drop off the map basically for a day or two if she was mad.</p>
<p>I did read that in the reports.</p>
<p>I think one time I read that there was, she had gotten in an argument and went out and</p>
<p>hung out with some friends near the airport and then came back and everything was fine.</p>
<p>And she had a history of that as well.</p>
<p>And I can only speculate being me back then, with the same technologies and the same way</p>
<p>you respond to calls, that&rsquo;s what their thought would have been because she had done this</p>
<p>before and you never want to rush into something, especially if you&rsquo;re adults, you have every</p>
<p>right to go anywhere you&rsquo;d like, but there was no caveat to this.</p>
<p>But Tuesday went by with no word from Donna.</p>
<p>So by the time Wednesday the 19th rolled around, authorities and Donna&rsquo;s loved ones made the</p>
<p>call to file a report and have Donna officially labeled a missing person.</p>
<p>With that, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension got involved.</p>
<p>Now, in a lot of cases that I&rsquo;ve talked about, like Dale Williams, Darwin Vest, and</p>
<p>Shelton Sanders, once the missing person&rsquo;s report is officially filed, the investigation</p>
<p>kind of takes off, but that wasn&rsquo;t really the case with Donna.</p>
<p>Even with the report filed, not much was done.</p>
<p>Everyone was just waiting for Donna to call up her parents and say that she was okay or</p>
<p>just come walking through the door at any moment with a story about where she&rsquo;d been.</p>
<p>But as the days passed, people started wondering if something terrible had happened to her.</p>
<p>Like maybe she&rsquo;d fallen into the nearby Mississippi River and froze to death or drowned.</p>
<p>So finally, on December 21st, this is five days since Donna was last seen and two days</p>
<p>since she was reported missing, this is when authorities set out on their first search.</p>
<p>And they went all out, maybe trying to make up for lost time.</p>
<p>Local fire departments and search and rescue dogs did ground searches in the area.</p>
<p>And a Minneapolis helicopter flew in to do an aerial search.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t find anything.</p>
<p>Police also sent out a release to the press about Donna&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>And they finally sat down for interviews with four critical people to this case, those who</p>
<p>were there that night at the get-together.</p>
<p>That was Donna&rsquo;s boyfriend Gary, Gary&rsquo;s ex-girlfriend, who was the mother of his child,</p>
<p>her name&rsquo;s Colleen Harwick, Gary and Colleen&rsquo;s preschool-age child, who we&rsquo;re gonna call</p>
<p>Adam, and Colleen&rsquo;s current boyfriend, Chuck Darnell.</p>
<p>So again, that&rsquo;s Gary, Gary&rsquo;s ex, their kid, and Gary&rsquo;s ex&rsquo;s current boyfriend.</p>
<p>So Gary was interviewed first, and here&rsquo;s what he said happened.</p>
<p>On the evening of Sunday, December 16th, he and Donna made the 20-something minute drive</p>
<p>from the home that they shared in Plainview to Colleen&rsquo;s house in Wabasha to drop his</p>
<p>son Adam back off after a weekend visit.</p>
<p>And when they arrived, Colleen invited him and Donna in for drinks, and they accepted.</p>
<p>Things were going well, they were all drinking, having a good time, until sometime between</p>
<p>10 and 11 p.m.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when he and Donna got into an argument.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not super clear what the argument was about, but it seemed like it had something</p>
<p>to do with the fact that Gary used to date Colleen.</p>
<p>Well, she wasn&rsquo;t mad until they started to enjoy their evening and have cocktails, and</p>
<p>then it came up, and that&rsquo;s where she got irritated.</p>
<p>And you know, I can&rsquo;t imagine being there and having cocktails, and then maybe they</p>
<p>were being, you know, batty-eyed and flirtatious, I don&rsquo;t know, I wasn&rsquo;t there, but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m reading is what happened, and she became upset over it.</p>
<p>Gary said that the argument got heated, and even physical at one point.</p>
<p>He told investigators that he ended up pushing Donna, and that was kind of the final straw</p>
<p>for her.</p>
<p>After that, she stormed off into the kitchen area.</p>
<p>Gary says that he took a moment to cool off, and then he went to go talk to her, but she</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t in the kitchen.</p>
<p>According to an interview Gary did with Winona Daily News, that&rsquo;s when his preschool-age</p>
<p>son told him that he saw Donna walk out the door.</p>
<p>So Gary walked outside to find her, but he didn&rsquo;t see her anywhere.</p>
<p>He noticed that her 82 Pontiac Bonneville was still in the driveway, and when he looked</p>
<p>inside of it, he saw her purse was sitting there, which meant that she probably wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have gone too far.</p>
<p>Gary told Winona Daily News, quote, I went out and looked in the alley, around the house,</p>
<p>anywhere I could look.</p>
<p>I looked under trees, anything, end quote.</p>
<p>Now remember, it was snowing that night, but Gary didn&rsquo;t mention seeing any footprints</p>
<p>or anything indicating where she&rsquo;d gone.</p>
<p>By the time 1145 rolled around with no signs of Donna, Gary decided it was time to call</p>
<p>the authorities.</p>
<p>He was especially worried about his girlfriend because he told police that she wasn&rsquo;t dressed</p>
<p>for the freezing temperature and the snow.</p>
<p>And so that was Gary&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>Next police talked with Chuck, who actually didn&rsquo;t have anything to offer.</p>
<p>He said that he was passed out on the couch from drinking too much when all of this went</p>
<p>down and he didn&rsquo;t remember a thing.</p>
<p>And like Chuck, Colleen didn&rsquo;t have much to say.</p>
<p>She told investigators that she was upstairs and didn&rsquo;t see anything.</p>
<p>Police even tried talking to Adam, the preschooler, but he couldn&rsquo;t really tell them anything</p>
<p>either.</p>
<p>All investigators had was Gary&rsquo;s statement and a woman who had vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>Even as the days continued dragging by with no word from Donna, authorities still weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>a hundred percent convinced that she was the victim of a crime.</p>
<p>On December 26th, then Wabasha police chief Dave Kruger told Winona Daily News flat out</p>
<p>that foul play was not suspected.</p>
<p>But it was clear that people in the community were losing hope that she would be found alive.</p>
<p>Local newspapers documented rumors that were flying around about Donna&rsquo;s disappearance</p>
<p>as the weeks and months passed by with no sign of her.</p>
<p>Some people were saying that she&rsquo;d been found dead in the Zumbro River, a tributary</p>
<p>of the Mississippi River on the outskirts of Wabasha.</p>
<p>Other people were gossiping that she&rsquo;d been found murdered and sexually assaulted in a</p>
<p>park.</p>
<p>Still, others claimed that they&rsquo;d seen her alive at local bars.</p>
<p>A psychic even came forward and said that they had a vision of Donna&rsquo;s body floating</p>
<p>in the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>But even though all of the talk going around town was nothing more than unsubstantiated</p>
<p>gossip, it still bothered Donna&rsquo;s mom, Phyllis.</p>
<p>She knew that Donna wouldn&rsquo;t have gone this long without calling if she was okay.</p>
<p>She certainly wouldn&rsquo;t have left her beloved car behind, but the thought of her daughter</p>
<p>dead somewhere was more than Phyllis could bear.</p>
<p>Donna&rsquo;s best friend, Mary Klein, agreed that vanishing with no word like this was</p>
<p>super unlike the Donna that she knew.</p>
<p>Mary was also quoted in the Winona Daily News saying that something had to have happened</p>
<p>to Donna for her to just disappear like this.</p>
<p>She thought maybe she drank too much alcohol and had become disoriented.</p>
<p>That mixed with the fact that she didn&rsquo;t have her glasses, maybe she walked into the</p>
<p>Mississippi River.</p>
<p>But not everyone agreed with Mary.</p>
<p>In that same article, Gary said that he thought Donna was still alive.</p>
<p>He knew she was drinking pretty heavily that night, but he said that she wasn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>a sloppy drunk or anything, and certainly not incoherent enough to put herself in danger</p>
<p>of drowning in the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>He said, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who the hell would walk into the river when it&rsquo;s freezing out?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Instead, Gary had his own theory about what happened.</p>
<p>He thought Donna ran away, perhaps with another man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite Donna&rsquo;s family growing less hopeful that she&rsquo;d turn up alive, they put out one</p>
<p>last desperate plea.</p>
<p>In that same Winona Daily News article, Donna&rsquo;s sister, Christina, said, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We just want Donna to know she should call us and that we love her.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>It took until March 1991 for investigators to really begin to consider the possibility</p>
<p>that Donna was the victim of a crime.</p>
<p>Three months after Donna vanished, then-Chief Kruger told the Star Tribune that there were</p>
<p>three possibilities.</p>
<p>She got disoriented and wandered into rough terrain and died there.</p>
<p>She hitched a ride somewhere, or she was the victim of foul play.</p>
<p>But with no evidence or clues, investigators were stuck, still not knowing if they had</p>
<p>a crime on their hands.</p>
<p>Donna&rsquo;s case remained at a standstill for the coming months, and things were only further</p>
<p>frustrated in July, when Gary died by suicide.</p>
<p>Since Gary was the last person to see Donna that December night, his death was a huge</p>
<p>blow to the investigation.</p>
<p>If there was anything that Gary had neglected to tell police about the night she vanished,</p>
<p>that information died with him.</p>
<p>And it left the community wondering what led to Gary making such a decision.</p>
<p>Was he driven by a shattered heart or a guilty conscience?</p>
<p>There were plenty of people who truly didn&rsquo;t think Gary had anything to do with Donna&rsquo;s</p>
<p>disappearance.</p>
<p>Her best friend Mary told Winona Daily News that she didn&rsquo;t think Gary would ever hurt</p>
<p>Donna.</p>
<p>She said, quote,</p>
<p>She would always talk about him.</p>
<p>I think she loved him, and he really loved her, end quote.</p>
<p>Mary also noted that Gary and Donna had big plans for their future, such as possibly publishing</p>
<p>a children&rsquo;s book that they had been writing together before she disappeared.</p>
<p>After Gary&rsquo;s death, Donna&rsquo;s case went ice cold.</p>
<p>There were a few tips here and there, supposed sightings and such, but nothing that ever</p>
<p>panned out.</p>
<p>The next big push in her case didn&rsquo;t come until 2006, when authorities tried using social</p>
<p>media to get her story out there, but that didn&rsquo;t really amount to anything noteworthy</p>
<p>either.</p>
<p>So when Chief Warren&rsquo;s Cold Case Board finished reviewing Donna&rsquo;s case in 2012, they were</p>
<p>ready to make some big moves.</p>
<p>Two decades was far too long for any case to sit essentially stagnant like that.</p>
<p>And once word got out that the police department was reexamining Donna&rsquo;s case, tips actually</p>
<p>came flooding in.</p>
<p>They got a psychic tip that Donna was in a wooded area well lit by the moon, but they</p>
<p>also got another psychic tip that was more specific and easier to investigate.</p>
<p>The tipster said that they felt Donna was behind the National Guard post in Wabasha</p>
<p>along Highway 61.</p>
<p>Now this tip was interesting because Chief Warren was already thinking about searching</p>
<p>that area.</p>
<p>He basically took this tip as the push he needed to get a search in motion.</p>
<p>He called in volunteers from the Community United Effort, or CUE, Center for Missing</p>
<p>Persons.</p>
<p>He wanted to search not only the area behind the National Guard building, but also a nearby</p>
<p>pond.</p>
<p>Since the people from the CUE Center were volunteers, he only had them in Wabasha for</p>
<p>the weekend, so they got busy.</p>
<p>Volunteers and cadaver dogs searched the National Guard armory area, but they found nothing.</p>
<p>And just as they were about to move on to that nearby pond, police got another tip.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting close to that body of water.</p>
<p>Someone had called in a tip and said that they found what they believe to be a monkey</p>
<p>skull on Highway 42, and that&rsquo;s just down the road here about four miles up on the hill.</p>
<p>So word came to me and I made a knee-jerk reaction call and suspended everything going</p>
<p>on in Wabasha and sent everybody up to this area where this skull was found.</p>
<p>Listen, I know what you&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<p>A monkey skull in Minnesota?</p>
<p>And just to save you a Google search, no, monkeys are not native to Minnesota, or even</p>
<p>North America for that matter.</p>
<p>So why this tipster would assume it was a monkey skull when they found it, I truly do</p>
<p>not have the slightest clue.</p>
<p>Chief Warren was also super baffled by this when he got the tip.</p>
<p>For good reason.</p>
<p>He assumed the quote-unquote monkey skull was probably human, maybe even Donna&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So like Chief Warren said, he asked everyone to go to the farm where it was found, not</p>
<p>only to collect the skull, but also to search the area for any other remains.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>When he got to the farm, he was told there had been a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The tipster said that they didn&rsquo;t actually have the skull with them anymore.</p>
<p>They hadn&rsquo;t even found it recently.</p>
<p>They found it back in the early 90s.</p>
<p>And since they just assumed, again, that it was a monkey skull, they didn&rsquo;t report it</p>
<p>back then.</p>
<p>And then get this.</p>
<p>After they found it, they ended up just tossing it into their manure spreader and spreading</p>
<p>it all across their fields.</p>
<p>You heard that right.</p>
<p>That skull had been completely destroyed years ago and was now fertilizing their fields.</p>
<p>I felt kind of awkward at the time.</p>
<p>I tried to hold back some of my reactions because I didn&rsquo;t understand how that could</p>
<p>happen.</p>
<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t their fault.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mine for suspending what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>So what I did was I pulled everybody up on that hillside and we searched two areas of</p>
<p>farmland that are about 100 acres.</p>
<p>And cadaver dogs had a couple hits.</p>
<p>But we took what we found and nothing ever came back to being human bone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest.</p>
<p>When I first heard that this tipster found a human-like skull and then proceeded to completely</p>
<p>destroy it, alarm bells started going off in my head.</p>
<p>Like saying that&rsquo;s suspicious is the understatement of the century.</p>
<p>But Chief Warren told our reporting team that he doesn&rsquo;t see it that way.</p>
<p>For one, they didn&rsquo;t think it was anything.</p>
<p>What perked their interest was all this stuff going on.</p>
<p>Years later, you know what?</p>
<p>Remember when I found that?</p>
<p>Yeah, call them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what happened.</p>
<p>No offense to them.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re in a rural area and farming is pretty big in Minnesota and a lot of things</p>
<p>go into those spreaders and get spread.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t think nothing of it.</p>
<p>But then years later, they&rsquo;re trying to help by saying, hey, we found this back then and</p>
<p>we thought it was a, but it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Well, then again, I don&rsquo;t know what age bracket this person was and I don&rsquo;t have a name, but</p>
<p>I know that they, they meant well, their intentions meant well.</p>
<p>After the devastation of that dead-end tip, Chief Warren said that he kind of took a step</p>
<p>back and realized that the investigation had gotten too big for their small agency to handle.</p>
<p>It just got blown out of the water and it got too big too quick.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to control.</p>
<p>It was like a wildfire.</p>
<p>So to contain it, we shut some things down just so things didn&rsquo;t get overblown.</p>
<p>And then, you know, you have psychics calling in cause this just, it blew up and then they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>calling in saying, well, she could be here.</p>
<p>And I took every single tip as if it were happening, but we&rsquo;re so small, we got overrun.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t handle it.</p>
<p>So we had to shut it down.</p>
<p>Chief Warren wanted to return to that pond that they nearly searched before getting the</p>
<p>skull tip.</p>
<p>But the timing with the Kew Center didn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t clear when it ever would.</p>
<p>But even though there was a pause on the large scale searches and the investigative efforts</p>
<p>for now, that didn&rsquo;t stop Chief Warren from quietly mulling over the case and looking</p>
<p>into his long held theory about what really happened to Donna.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been saying it from the get-go, I don&rsquo;t believe she ever left the house.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just tell you what I think happened and hopefully I don&rsquo;t get criticized too much</p>
<p>for it.</p>
<p>But my theory is they had that argument and I think Gary shoved her, like he said he did.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s as easy as her hitting her head on the side of that table or the floor</p>
<p>and killed her and he freaked out.</p>
<p>And Chief Warren&rsquo;s theory wasn&rsquo;t coming from out of left field.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d actually received a few tips from some of Colleen&rsquo;s old neighbors that she&rsquo;d gotten</p>
<p>a lot of cement delivered to her house just two days after Donna went missing.</p>
<p>So I checked the records, of course, they had some work there done from the cement company</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, what the heck?</p>
<p>Making things even more suspicious was the fact that there was no record of Colleen hiring</p>
<p>anyone to do the cement work.</p>
<p>She just had the cement delivered to her house.</p>
<p>And there was still one more thing supporting Chief Warren&rsquo;s theory, the fact that one</p>
<p>of Donna&rsquo;s eyeglass lenses was found at Colleen&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>He found it hard to believe that she would just run out the door into the night without</p>
<p>her glasses fully working or intact.</p>
<p>So in 2013, armed with a hunch and a little bit of evidence, Chief Warren decided to see</p>
<p>if he could prove his suspicions that Donna never left the house and was buried somewhere</p>
<p>in the basement.</p>
<p>Now obviously a hunch, no matter how strong, isn&rsquo;t probable cause, so Chief Warren knew</p>
<p>he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get a search warrant.</p>
<p>And instead, he needed to get the current homeowner&rsquo;s permission to search the basement.</p>
<p>Colleen no longer owned the house, but one of her relatives did.</p>
<p>Understandably, Chief Warren was worried that the relative wouldn&rsquo;t welcome into their</p>
<p>home a search team that might prove their family member helped cover up a homicide.</p>
<p>But to his surprise, they okayed the search.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned earlier, Wabasha is a small, rural city, so they didn&rsquo;t have all the</p>
<p>resources like a large metropolitan police department might have.</p>
<p>And they certainly weren&rsquo;t equipped to do a scan of a cement basement all by themselves.</p>
<p>So Chief Warren called in reinforcements.</p>
<p>We brought a team in.</p>
<p>It was a non-profit out of Wisconsin with a floor scanner and some cadaver dogs and</p>
<p>some screens that we could sift dirt on.</p>
<p>So what we did was we drilled boreholes.</p>
<p>First of all, we scanned the entire basement.</p>
<p>Well, not the entire basement, but we scanned it.</p>
<p>And we took some tests with the homeowner&rsquo;s permission that we&rsquo;d fix anything that we</p>
<p>disturbed.</p>
<p>We finished our testing and we left.</p>
<p>Chief Warren wasn&rsquo;t sure when he would get the results of those tests back.</p>
<p>So he waited patiently.</p>
<p>And waited.</p>
<p>And eventually, he got tired of waiting.</p>
<p>So I called.</p>
<p>Look, I want to see that floor scan because there&rsquo;s a portion of that basement that wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>done by this non-profit, right?</p>
<p>So I called the place and I won&rsquo;t say names because it&rsquo;s not right for me to point fingers.</p>
<p>But they said, well, we don&rsquo;t save that data.</p>
<p>And I said, well, but I never saw the data.</p>
<p>You heard that right.</p>
<p>The non-profit didn&rsquo;t save the data of the scan, but they also never bothered to tell</p>
<p>Chief Warren what was found with the scan, if anything.</p>
<p>So all of that hard work, all of those results were just completely gone.</p>
<p>I was professionally disappointed that I was on that and didn&rsquo;t know that I didn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>to see the data.</p>
<p>You talk about having dreams about it even, I mean, you work so hard on something.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know they didn&rsquo;t save that data, but that&rsquo;s how you learn.</p>
<p>Chief Warren said that even if he had gotten the results back, he&rsquo;s not sure that they</p>
<p>would have been what he was hoping for because they didn&rsquo;t get to examine the entirety of</p>
<p>the basement.</p>
<p>The basement theory is one that he continued holding on to.</p>
<p>Even after leaving the Wabasha Police Department in the fall of 2015 to become the chief deputy</p>
<p>at the Wabasha County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office.</p>
<p>But when he left the police department, he didn&rsquo;t want to leave Donna&rsquo;s case behind,</p>
<p>especially considering that the sheriff&rsquo;s office had more resources at their fingertips</p>
<p>than the police department did.</p>
<p>So I wasn&rsquo;t doing it to, hey, I want to keep this for me.</p>
<p>I was doing it saying, hey, we&rsquo;re going to ride with this because we have more resources.</p>
<p>And, you know, instead of just you working on it, let&rsquo;s all work on it.</p>
<p>Since 2015, there hasn&rsquo;t been much movement in Donna&rsquo;s case, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sitting on a shelf just collecting dust.</p>
<p>Even when there have been lulls, Chief Deputy Warren has been thumbing through the case</p>
<p>file hoping something new will pop out at him with each read through.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also actively planning to return to Colleen&rsquo;s old home, which, by the way, is</p>
<p>still owned by that same relative.</p>
<p>He wants to retest the basement for human remains.</p>
<p>So sometime soon when I get permission, I do plan on going back and having ground zero</p>
<p>completely done so I can tell the residents I won&rsquo;t be back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m satisfied nothing&rsquo;s here, but I can&rsquo;t say that right now because I still believe that.</p>
<p>Sometimes some things aren&rsquo;t as far away as you think they are, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>And if it ends up that way, then so be it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s got to be found.</p>
<p>This time, instead of using a nonprofit for the testing, he is bringing in the Minnesota</p>
<p>Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, who have more tools at their disposal.</p>
<p>Well, they have the ground penetrating radar that got better since the last time I used it.</p>
<p>They have forensic testing they can do on the underfloor of that house.</p>
<p>Even today, they can do that, the luminol.</p>
<p>They could do that and see the blue if they&rsquo;d like, but yeah, it&rsquo;d be different to see.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s put it this way.</p>
<p>They have more things at their disposal than I ever thought even existed, and we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have that type of technology.</p>
<p>We asked Chief Deputy Warren if he&rsquo;s worried that the first search scared someone who might</p>
<p>have knowledge of the case.</p>
<p>And if Donna really was buried down there in the basement, maybe they dug her up and</p>
<p>moved her.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s confident that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>Wabasha is a small city, and Colleen&rsquo;s old house is located on one of the main roads,</p>
<p>so he thinks that someone would have definitely seen something suspicious.</p>
<p>Chief Deputy Warren remains hopeful that future testing will yield results to confirm his</p>
<p>theory.</p>
<p>And he told our reporting team that a very recent conversation with a key person in the</p>
<p>case has him more confident than ever that it will.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t want to elaborate on who that person was or what they said so as to protect</p>
<p>the integrity of the investigation.</p>
<p>We asked him if the next search of the basement doesn&rsquo;t show any sign of Donna, what else</p>
<p>does he think could have happened to her if she truly did storm out of the house that</p>
<p>cold December night?</p>
<p>What else would have happened?</p>
<p>As easy as leaving the house, walking down the 60, getting in the truck with a trucker</p>
<p>or something?</p>
<p>He also thinks it&rsquo;s possible that she was dumped in that nearby pond that he wanted</p>
<p>to search with the Kew Center back in 2012.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually something he still wants to search.</p>
<p>With technology comes better equipment, and I think maybe we could have a search of that</p>
<p>pond done to the owner&rsquo;s wall.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all murky.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t see nothing.</p>
<p>Well, but maybe the technology can.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m the Titanic, why not?</p>
<p>Chief Deputy Warren also said that both Colleen and Chuck are still alive, and he wants to</p>
<p>re-interview them soon, hoping that maybe, just maybe, they hold the key to solving a</p>
<p>case that has haunted Wabasha since 1990.</p>
<p>For more than 30 years, Donna&rsquo;s family and friends have been left wondering what happened</p>
<p>to her.</p>
<p>They deserve closure, and Donna deserves justice.</p>
<p>If you have any information about the 1990 disappearance of Donna Ingersoll, please contact</p>
<p>Chief Deputy Jim Warren at the Wabasha County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office at 651-565-3361, or you</p>
<p>can email him at jwarren, W-A-R-R-E-N, at co.wabasha.mn.us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have all of that in the show notes.</p>
<p>Donna was 4'11 and about 106 pounds when she vanished.</p>
<p>She has blonde hair and green or hazel eyes, and was last seen wearing boots and blue jeans.</p>
<p>She would be 57 years old today.</p>
