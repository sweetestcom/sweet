    <p>Our card this week is Natasha Warren, the four of hearts from South Carolina.</p>
<p>In 2008, Natasha was a young mother of two who was working two jobs to provide for her</p>
<p>family, when one night, on a dark stretch of road, a stranger came across her path and</p>
<p>forever changed her life.</p>
<p>That person has gone unnamed and unknown for 14 years, and now, law enforcement is opening</p>
<p>up, hoping justice can finally be served.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>On Sunday, August 24th, 2008, in Columbia, South Carolina, Adrienne Warren was on her</p>
<p>way to help a friend move.</p>
<p>Her friend had worn out her welcome at her sister&rsquo;s apartment in Columbia, so Adrienne</p>
<p>volunteered to help the woman until she could find her own place.</p>
<p>Now Adrienne was pretty sure that her friend could stay with her sister, Natasha, for a</p>
<p>Natasha had a three-bedroom apartment nearby, and she worked so much that she was hardly</p>
<p>ever there.</p>
<p>But Adrienne hadn&rsquo;t actually gotten around to asking Natasha if that plan would be okay</p>
<p>because she hadn&rsquo;t seen her sister for a week.</p>
<p>Now Natasha did have two small kids, two boys just two and three years old.</p>
<p>But Adrienne and Natasha&rsquo;s mom often watched the kids because Natasha had been working</p>
<p>two jobs and finishing up college, and their dads weren&rsquo;t really around.</p>
<p>It was about 10 a.m. when Adrienne was driving on the highway to her friend&rsquo;s house, thinking</p>
<p>about all of that, when she noticed a car parked on the side of Interstate 26.</p>
<p>And that car looked a lot like Natasha&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>She wondered for a minute if it was her sister&rsquo;s because where it was located was only a few</p>
<p>miles from where Natasha lived.</p>
<p>Adrienne wasn&rsquo;t able to stop or turn around to check because it was a busy morning and</p>
<p>she was due at her friend&rsquo;s place to help her start packing.</p>
<p>And honestly, the glimpse of the familiar car didn&rsquo;t cross Adrienne&rsquo;s mind after that.</p>
<p>When Adrienne finished helping her friend pack, she drove over to Natasha&rsquo;s apartment</p>
<p>to arrange for her friend&rsquo;s stay and run the plan by Natasha.</p>
<p>But Natasha wasn&rsquo;t home.</p>
<p>Again, that wasn&rsquo;t all that unusual since Adrienne knew Natasha worked a lot and was</p>
<p>never really at her apartment for very long.</p>
<p>At the time, Natasha didn&rsquo;t have a working cell phone, so Adrienne couldn&rsquo;t call or text</p>
<p>her to see where she was or relay a message about Adrienne&rsquo;s friend wanting to crash</p>
<p>at her place.</p>
<p>But Adrienne did have a working number for Natasha&rsquo;s fianc√©, Michael, though.</p>
<p>So she called him and he told her that he hadn&rsquo;t heard from Natasha since Friday night,</p>
<p>almost two days earlier, when she called from a payphone and left a voicemail saying she&rsquo;d</p>
<p>gotten a flat tire on her way to work the night shift at the post office.</p>
<p>Like I said earlier, Natasha had two jobs.</p>
<p>One was at the Columbia Postal Mail Processing and Distribution Center, and one was as a</p>
<p>patient care assistant at Providence Hospital.</p>
<p>After hanging up with Natasha&rsquo;s fianc√© and learning that her sister had car trouble,</p>
<p>Adrienne thought about the car that she had seen on the side of the interstate.</p>
<p>Now, she was sure that that familiar looking car must have been her sister&rsquo;s after all.</p>
<p>It would make sense why it was pulled over.</p>
<p>And not only that, where it was parked would have been on the way to the postal processing</p>
<p>center where Natasha worked.</p>
<p>While Adrienne is connecting the dots in her head and talking with Natasha&rsquo;s fianc√©,</p>
<p>a South Carolina state trooper had stopped to check on the car.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t do this because any of Natasha&rsquo;s family had asked him to, he was just making</p>
<p>his normal patrol rounds.</p>
<p>He saw the car pulled over in a really busy area on the highway right near an exit for</p>
<p>Bush River Road.</p>
<p>He could tell right away that the car had a flat tire, so he pulled behind it to see</p>
<p>if the driver needed help.</p>
<p>From where he parked his cruiser, he couldn&rsquo;t see anyone inside.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t look like anyone was in the driver&rsquo;s seat, and he figured whoever had broken down</p>
<p>probably walked off to get help or had been picked up.</p>
<p>So he thought he might need to report the car as an abandoned vehicle.</p>
<p>But as he got closer to the driver&rsquo;s side window, he saw something alarming.</p>
<p>A woman&rsquo;s lifeless body propped in the driver&rsquo;s seat, covered in blood.</p>
<p>The trooper immediately radioed for the Richland County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department to respond,</p>
<p>and within minutes, deputies arrived along with the county coroner.</p>
<p>Now the timing of the trooper&rsquo;s discovery is wild, because by the time Adrian got off</p>
<p>the phone with Natasha&rsquo;s fianc√©, figured out it was likely her sister&rsquo;s car that</p>
<p>she spotted earlier on the highway, and then drove back to check it out, the roadway had</p>
<p>turned into a crime scene.</p>
<p>When Adrian pulled over near the Bush River Road exit, all she could see were cop cars</p>
<p>and yellow crime scene tape around her sister&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>A deputy told her to stay back because they&rsquo;d found a deceased female in the vehicle.</p>
<p>Adrian spoke with our reporter Emily for this episode, but she didn&rsquo;t want to be recorded.</p>
<p>She said that in that moment, talking with the deputy and seeing all the chaos unfolding</p>
<p>around Natasha&rsquo;s car, she couldn&rsquo;t even think straight.</p>
<p>She remembers the investigators asking her why she was there, and her telling them that</p>
<p>she thought the car belonged to her sister.</p>
<p>She said one deputy asked her if Natasha had any tattoos to try and help them determine</p>
<p>if the woman in the vehicle was, in fact, Natasha.</p>
<p>They needed some concrete form of identification from someone who knew Natasha, because at</p>
<p>the time, investigators had not found Natasha&rsquo;s driver&rsquo;s license in the car, or any form</p>
<p>of ID that could help them identify the dead woman.</p>
<p>And so they specifically asked Adrian about any tattoos because they didn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>walk her over to see the body, in case it was her sister.</p>
<p>At that point, the coroner had looked over the body and determined that, based on her</p>
<p>stage of decomposition from the August heat, she&rsquo;d likely been in the car and dead for</p>
<p>at least a day, if not two.</p>
<p>So she wasn&rsquo;t in a physical state that police felt would be good for Adrian to see.</p>
<p>So Adrian told police about a tattoo Natasha had on her back, and that is how they were</p>
<p>able to confirm that it was, in fact, her sister.</p>
<p>Adrian was horrified by the news and quickly left the highway scene in a state of panic.</p>
<p>She went back to Natasha&rsquo;s apartment, and by that point, there were cops everywhere.</p>
<p>But not just cops.</p>
<p>Upstairs, Adrian ran into Natasha&rsquo;s fianc√© Michael and his brother looking around.</p>
<p>Adrian says that she was surprised to see the two of them there, so she asked what he</p>
<p>was doing, and he said that he came over to look for any clues or evidence.</p>
<p>Adrian knew that he lived a town over, and actually would have had to pass right by the</p>
<p>crime scene to get to Natasha&rsquo;s apartment.</p>
<p>She told Emily that she immediately felt it was odd that he wouldn&rsquo;t have stopped</p>
<p>at Natasha&rsquo;s car first to speak with police or do any of the stuff that she had just done</p>
<p>with the cops on the side of the highway.</p>
<p>Adrian pressed him about why he hadn&rsquo;t mentioned anything to anyone about not seeing or hearing</p>
<p>from Natasha for two days.</p>
<p>She also asked him why he&rsquo;d not followed up with Natasha after he got her voicemail</p>
<p>Friday night about being stranded with a flat tire.</p>
<p>His response, according to Adrian, was that he hadn&rsquo;t seen the voicemail until hours</p>
<p>after Natasha left it, and so he figured that Natasha had probably called one of her cousins</p>
<p>or a friend to help her.</p>
<p>This response didn&rsquo;t really sit right with Adrian, and Richland County investigators</p>
<p>also felt that something about Michael&rsquo;s answers were odd.</p>
<p>At the time, Natasha and her fianc√© didn&rsquo;t live together, and because of their busy schedules,</p>
<p>mostly Natasha&rsquo;s, they didn&rsquo;t see each other every day.</p>
<p>But investigators wondered, what couple goes days without speaking, especially when one</p>
<p>of them knows the other is without a working car or having car issues?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Richland County cold case investigator Dottie Cronice discussing this very point</p>
<p>with our investigator.</p>
<p>Do you find it odd that like her boss or a family member didn&rsquo;t call her in missing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say, because she lived close enough, I mean she was just off of her St.</p>
<p>Andrews Road exit, that the family may have thought that she got a ride back to her apartment</p>
<p>or that she got a ride to work, and the boss may have thought, well, she&rsquo;s having car difficulties,</p>
<p>she can&rsquo;t get the tire changed, so she&rsquo;s just, you know, she just didn&rsquo;t show today.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really say what they thought.</p>
<p>Those are simply speculations on my part, as to what might have been reasonable, because</p>
<p>she lived here in Columbia, she didn&rsquo;t live with family members who were out of county.</p>
<p>Dottie sat down with us to go over what investigators were working off of at the start of the investigation.</p>
<p>By midday on Sunday, hours after finding Natasha, detectives launched a full-blown murder investigation.</p>
<p>They labeled it a homicide because it was determined on scene that Natasha had been</p>
<p>shot in the chest, and no weapon was found near her or in her car, so it wasn&rsquo;t possible</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;d chosen to take her own life.</p>
<p>Someone else had definitely killed her.</p>
<p>Natasha&rsquo;s remains were taken for an autopsy, where the coroner officially ruled her death</p>
<p>a homicide by gunshot.</p>
<p>A closer forensic examination of Natasha&rsquo;s body further ruled out any kind of suicide</p>
<p>theory, because the wound in her upper chest had entered at an angle that police said would</p>
<p>have been virtually impossible for anyone to make if they had a gun pointing towards</p>
<p>themselves, holding it with both hands or even one hand.</p>
<p>What happened was most definitely not accidental.</p>
<p>Detectives towed her car to the sheriff&rsquo;s department and combed it for more evidence.</p>
<p>As police were gathering evidence and lining up interviews with possible witnesses and</p>
<p>family members, Adrienne, her mom, and Natasha&rsquo;s other family members were reeling with grief,</p>
<p>and trying to figure out how to explain to Natasha&rsquo;s two sons what was going on and</p>
<p>why their mother would never be coming home.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s 23, has two young children, I believe one was two years old, and the other little</p>
<p>boy is four, and they are now left with some very hard explanations for the adults to try</p>
<p>to give them.</p>
<p>Natasha&rsquo;s fianc√©, Michael, was not the father of her two kids.</p>
<p>The boys had different dads from Natasha&rsquo;s previous relationships.</p>
<p>But the fathers of Natasha&rsquo;s two sons were ruled out really early on because Richland</p>
<p>County determined that they had alibis and weren&rsquo;t even in the area at the time Natasha</p>
<p>was believed to have been killed, which police were pretty certain was late Friday night</p>
<p>or possibly early Saturday morning based on the state her body was in when they had found</p>
<p>her.</p>
<p>Michael also had a fairly solid alibi for that Friday night.</p>
<p>He told police that he was at work late on Friday at a Food Lion grocery store plant.</p>
<p>He said he worked his regular 7 p.m. to 1 a.m. shift.</p>
<p>Detectives confirmed his story after interviewing his co-workers, and they all vouched that</p>
<p>he was at work late Friday night and didn&rsquo;t get off until early Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Records from his cell phone show that it was turned on but inside his car in the plant&rsquo;s</p>
<p>parking lot because he was working in the freezer rooms on Friday night.</p>
<p>So that fact supported his claim that he had not received Natasha&rsquo;s call for help about</p>
<p>the flat tire until he got off work Saturday morning and checked his phone.</p>
<p>Which all of that makes me wonder why Natasha even called her fiance from the payphone of</p>
<p>the gas station in the first place, if she knew that he was at work and wouldn&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<p>The best thing I can think is that maybe she thought he would take a break, see the voicemail</p>
<p>and decide to come help her and change her tire.</p>
<p>Or maybe she assumed he wouldn&rsquo;t be working in the freezer section that night.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t always work in that part of the facility.</p>
<p>Police say that they don&rsquo;t know the answer to these questions either.</p>
<p>Back in 2008, the main lead they chose to follow was looking further into Natasha&rsquo;s</p>
<p>relationship with Michael.</p>
<p>Detectives wanted to figure out if there was something they were missing, something that</p>
<p>could be a red flag.</p>
<p>And it turns out, there was.</p>
<p>According to Natasha&rsquo;s sister Adrienne, Natasha and her fiance planned to get married</p>
<p>in late September of 2008, just one month after she was killed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a small detail, but one that stuck out to law enforcement, especially because</p>
<p>when Natasha was found in her car, she wasn&rsquo;t wearing her engagement ring.</p>
<p>Police initially thought that was odd, but when they talked with her family and friends,</p>
<p>they learned that it wasn&rsquo;t all that uncommon for Natasha to leave her ring behind at home</p>
<p>when she went to her jobs, and they did find her ring back at her apartment.</p>
<p>So her not wearing it wasn&rsquo;t a huge red flag.</p>
<p>But what was, was a conversation Adrienne told police she&rsquo;d had with her sister not</p>
<p>long before she had died, and it was regarding her upcoming wedding.</p>
<p>In July, so just a few weeks before she was killed, Natasha and Adrienne went wedding</p>
<p>dress shopping.</p>
<p>Adrienne said that while she was helping Natasha pick out a wedding dress, she noticed that</p>
<p>Natasha didn&rsquo;t seem very excited about getting married.</p>
<p>She said there was no sense of joy in her sister&rsquo;s mood, and it felt like Natasha</p>
<p>was maybe even a little bit sad.</p>
<p>Adrienne, who&rsquo;s seven years older than Natasha, said it got to the point where she told her</p>
<p>baby sister that if she didn&rsquo;t want to get married and didn&rsquo;t feel like this decision</p>
<p>was the right one, that she didn&rsquo;t have to go through with the wedding if she didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to.</p>
<p>She said she told Natasha, right there in one of the dress boutiques, that she should</p>
<p>consider either a longer engagement or a breakup with Michael if the wedding wasn&rsquo;t what</p>
<p>she wanted.</p>
<p>Natasha and Michael had only known one another for about a year before they got engaged.</p>
<p>Adrienne told our reporter that throughout most of his and Natasha&rsquo;s relationship, she&rsquo;d</p>
<p>always been a little bit skeptical of him.</p>
<p>She said the way Natasha and Michael met was kind of a whirlwind and atypical.</p>
<p>She said that one night after working a long shift and attending college classes, Natasha</p>
<p>had dozed off at the wheel and actually crashed her car.</p>
<p>A guy showed up and offered to help her, and less than a year later, he&rsquo;d proposed and</p>
<p>the two were engaged.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s where things get even more interesting.</p>
<p>Adrienne said that about a week before the murder, which would have been the last time</p>
<p>she saw her sister alive, the whole family was at their grandparents&rsquo; house for a Sunday</p>
<p>dinner.</p>
<p>Natasha and Michael were there, but Natasha barely said anything.</p>
<p>Adrienne found out that the reason there seemed to be so much tension was because Natasha</p>
<p>had recently tried to break things off, but her fianc√© wanted to work it out.</p>
<p>Adrienne said that she remembered going out to their car as they were leaving dinner and</p>
<p>Natasha had a look in her eyes that told Adrienne she was unhappy.</p>
<p>And Michael just looked at Adrienne and said that he and Natasha were going to work everything</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>Adrienne says that she took that comment as less of a reassuring gesture and more of a</p>
<p>way of him saying, mind your own business.</p>
<p>To this day, that interaction and the dress shopping conversation breaks Adrienne&rsquo;s</p>
<p>heart to think about, because she feels guilty for trying to help her little sister get out</p>
<p>of a bad relationship, but not being able to actually do anything to really help her.</p>
<p>After learning all of this information from Adrienne, the police investigating Natasha&rsquo;s</p>
<p>death at the time had no doubt that the couple&rsquo;s relationship was rocky and not in the best</p>
<p>place.</p>
<p>But again, Michael&rsquo;s alibi checked out, and when asked directly by police in an interview</p>
<p>if he had anything to do with Natasha&rsquo;s death, Michael said no, he didn&rsquo;t even own a gun.</p>
<p>Investigators had nothing to go on to say that he was involved in any way, so they had</p>
<p>to move on.</p>
<p>They began re-evaluating everything they&rsquo;d learned and tried to piece together the moments</p>
<p>leading up to Natasha&rsquo;s murder, and here&rsquo;s what they determined.</p>
<p>Natasha was driving to her job at the post office at 10.30 p.m. on Friday, August 22nd.</p>
<p>While she was nearing the Brush River Road exit, she likely realized something was wrong</p>
<p>with one of her tires and pulled over.</p>
<p>She got out and saw the flat tire, and because she didn&rsquo;t have a cell phone, she walked</p>
<p>down the exit ramp to a nearby Sonico gas station to use the phone.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Dottie again to explain who Natasha called and what police believe happened next.</p>
<p>She goes into Sonico, she calls a family member and she called her boss, one to get</p>
<p>help and the other to let him know that she was going to be late, and then she goes back</p>
<p>to the car, and I believe she goes back into the Sonico station three more times, and one</p>
<p>time she actually goes in and uses the restroom, and then goes back to the vehicle.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, as we well know, she was killed and left there on the side of the</p>
<p>road in her vehicle.</p>
<p>According to Dottie, the female gas station attendant working in the store that night</p>
<p>was never a suspect.</p>
<p>She cooperated with police and told them exactly what she remembered from that night, including</p>
<p>all the times Natasha came and went from the store to her car and back.</p>
<p>They had spoken with her, you know, they tried to get her to let, you know, use our phone,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t use the payphone.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m going to use the payphone.</p>
<p>You know, she was, she was independent, I&rsquo;m going to use the payphone.</p>
<p>She got her quarters from the register and used the payphone and made the phone calls</p>
<p>that she needed to make, and it&rsquo;s just a sad set of circumstances, perhaps even a perfect</p>
<p>storm that you&rsquo;re a single female and you&rsquo;re stuck there on the side of the road and nowhere</p>
<p>to go, and you can speculate all day long, well, why didn&rsquo;t she just stay at the Sonico</p>
<p>station, any number of things, but she didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>She walked back to her cars, as far as we know, that&rsquo;s what she did.</p>
<p>And the most tragic thing that could happen then.</p>
<p>Based on surveillance video, the interview with a gas station employee, and the logs</p>
<p>from the payphone, detectives think Natasha was alive and going back and forth between</p>
<p>her car and the gas station for at least an hour.</p>
<p>So that would mean she likely was alive up until close to midnight.</p>
<p>The last phone call she made was around 1130, 1120 that night on the 22nd.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not discovered until 1130 Sunday morning.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re 36 hours from basically the last phone call till her body is discovered there</p>
<p>on the side of the road in her vehicle.</p>
<p>So to recap, the calls to her fiance and to her boss were the only calls police know of</p>
<p>that Natasha made that night.</p>
<p>So either Natasha decided to wait for Michael to get her voicemail and come help, or she</p>
<p>ran out of change to call more friends or more family for help.</p>
<p>Now, the crime junkie in me has to wonder why the boss didn&rsquo;t think it was weird when</p>
<p>Natasha never showed up for work.</p>
<p>But according to police, her boss has never been considered a suspect, and they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know why he didn&rsquo;t report her overdue and she didn&rsquo;t show up.</p>
<p>But like Dottie said, maybe her boss figured Natasha couldn&rsquo;t resolve the car issue and</p>
<p>just was a no-show for her shift.</p>
<p>Detectives didn&rsquo;t have too much time to focus on why Natasha&rsquo;s boss didn&rsquo;t do what would</p>
<p>have been helpful, because as investigators dug for more information about who else was</p>
<p>at the gas station Friday night, detectives saw a lone man on surveillance video waltzing</p>
<p>into the service station at the exact time they knew Natasha was there.</p>
<p>In a press release that followed the discovery of this man on the store&rsquo;s videotapes, authorities</p>
<p>were careful not to refer to him as a suspect.</p>
<p>They called him a person of interest, basically just someone they wanted to talk to in case</p>
<p>he was a witness to anything that could help lead the investigation in a helpful direction.</p>
<p>He was there in the store, I believe, with her at the time, and came from the same area</p>
<p>where she was walking from in the parking lot, and thought that he may have seen somebody</p>
<p>near the car.</p>
<p>I believe he came in, gave a statement.</p>
<p>Detectives have never released what information the man gave in his statement, but it was</p>
<p>helpful.</p>
<p>They gleaned some new info from him that they hoped would come in handy someday.</p>
<p>But as far as what exactly he told them, authorities still won&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>But they will say this.</p>
<p>As far as I know, he was not involved.</p>
<p>The next person they see on the store&rsquo;s surveillance video takes investigators by surprise.</p>
<p>Another man crossed paths with Natasha that night, but this guy was wearing a police uniform.</p>
<p>During one of Natasha&rsquo;s trips back into the gas station, as she was waiting in line</p>
<p>for change to use the payphone, she&rsquo;s seen standing behind a uniformed police officer.</p>
<p>On the video, you don&rsquo;t see Natasha and this officer have any interaction or conversation,</p>
<p>and detectives trying to solve her murder wonder why she didn&rsquo;t ask the officer for</p>
<p>help if she was having car troubles.</p>
<p>In hindsight, police were thinking he could have changed her tire for her, and she would</p>
<p>have been well on her way to work before her killer had the chance to attack.</p>
<p>But detectives probably didn&rsquo;t take into consideration that as a young black woman,</p>
<p>Natasha might not have felt comfortable asking a police officer for help.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the officer actually worked for the Richland County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department,</p>
<p>the very agency who would end up investigating her murder.</p>
<p>Detectives followed up with him, and unfortunately, he didn&rsquo;t remember seeing or hearing anything</p>
<p>suspicious in that area while he was in front of Natasha in line.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t even see Natasha&rsquo;s car, because he didn&rsquo;t take that highway exit ramp to</p>
<p>get to the gas station.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d actually approached the store from a different direction on Bush River Road.</p>
<p>Natasha&rsquo;s family told investigators that it didn&rsquo;t surprise them Natasha had not</p>
<p>asked the cop for help.</p>
<p>She was fiercely independent, and Adrienne said that she did everything on her own.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s safe to assume that if she had known how to change a tire, she would have done</p>
<p>that before calling for help or asking a police officer to help her.</p>
<p>She also never called 911 from the payphone.</p>
<p>She only called Michael and her boss.</p>
<p>Adrienne wasn&rsquo;t surprised at all to learn that Natasha had likely waited in her car</p>
<p>for help rather than hanging around the gas station.</p>
<p>She said her sister maintained such a busy lifestyle that she would sometimes take power</p>
<p>naps in her driver&rsquo;s seat in between obligations.</p>
<p>According to everyone who knew her, Natasha wasn&rsquo;t afraid of being alone.</p>
<p>And she also didn&rsquo;t have any enemies to be afraid of.</p>
<p>She, from all accounts, a good student, attentive mother, good sister, daughter.</p>
<p>Not causing anybody any aggravations or problems, trying to get her education, working two jobs</p>
<p>to do the things that she really wanted to do and accomplish, and to have a better life</p>
<p>for her children.</p>
<p>You go back and you wonder, you know, why do good people have bad things happen to them?</p>
<p>This is one of those instances.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so hard for the family to understand what would make someone want to do this.</p>
<p>Figuring out the motive behind the crime was authorities&rsquo; biggest challenge.</p>
<p>Answering the hard questions that Dottie just asked were constantly on detectives&rsquo; minds</p>
<p>in 2008.</p>
<p>Fortunately, authorities caught a small break about a week after the crime.</p>
<p>Some information came in that completely changed who authorities thought could be</p>
<p>responsible for such a brutal murder.</p>
<p>A few days after Natasha&rsquo;s body was found, a group of teenagers was arrested in Richland</p>
<p>County for robbing a convenience store not far from the murder scene.</p>
<p>One of the suspects who&rsquo;d been caught was a young woman.</p>
<p>She told police that she&rsquo;d acted as a getaway driver in a string of robberies, and three</p>
<p>guys she&rsquo;d been associated with had been the ones to actually rob the stores.</p>
<p>She told police that on Friday night, August 22nd, the three guys she&rsquo;d been working</p>
<p>with had borrowed her van, and the next day she overheard them talking about something</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d done to someone.</p>
<p>It was a super vague statement, but the girl went on to tell police she also found some</p>
<p>weird stuff in her van after the boys brought it back, like a comb and a part of a woman&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weave.</p>
<p>So police interviewed all four of the teen suspects separately since they were already</p>
<p>in custody for the robberies.</p>
<p>And they straight up asked them if they&rsquo;d been involved in what happened to a woman</p>
<p>on the side of the Interstate 26 on August 22nd.</p>
<p>Detectives figured because Natasha&rsquo;s driver&rsquo;s license had been missing from her car, one</p>
<p>possible motive for whoever killed her could have been robbery.</p>
<p>And there were things missing from the car, but there was nothing in that car, as her</p>
<p>sister Adrienne said, that was worth killing her over.</p>
<p>Police won&rsquo;t say on the record what specific items were missing from Natasha&rsquo;s car, but</p>
<p>they confirmed that it wasn&rsquo;t anything of value.</p>
<p>Two of the teenagers got lawyers right away, but the others started talking more with investigators.</p>
<p>The female suspect, who said that she thought she heard the guys talking about something</p>
<p>that could have been the murder, even agreed to take a polygraph.</p>
<p>But during the questioning, she kept changing her story.</p>
<p>At first, she said she thought her co-robbers killed Natasha.</p>
<p>Then she said she was just telling police what they wanted to hear so the robbery charges</p>
<p>against her would be dropped and she could get out of jail.</p>
<p>She ended up failing two polygraph tests, one where they questioned her about being</p>
<p>at the scene of the murder, and another where they questioned what she knew about it based</p>
<p>on what the male suspects had said.</p>
<p>The fact that she failed both polygraphs didn&rsquo;t help the investigation at all.</p>
<p>It just muddied the process.</p>
<p>At that point, investigators were running short on any evidence connecting the teens</p>
<p>to Natasha&rsquo;s killing, and the changing stories weren&rsquo;t helping things.</p>
<p>On top of that, the gun that the group had been using during their gas station robberies</p>
<p>was not the same type of gun that police knew had been used to shoot Natasha.</p>
<p>You see, it was a semi-automatic pistol that had been used to kill Natasha.</p>
<p>And according to Richland County, the gun that the teens had was not semi-automatic.</p>
<p>So what police thought was going to be their big break was looking more and more like a reach.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have enough to charge any of the teens with Natasha&rsquo;s murder, so</p>
<p>they had to let them go.</p>
<p>They still faced punishment for their robbery crimes, but over the next several years,</p>
<p>Natasha&rsquo;s case went cold.</p>
<p>Detectives continued to try and connect the teens or any of their associates to the crime,</p>
<p>but nothing ever materialized.</p>
<p>According to Dottie, sexual assault has actually risen to the top of the list as a more likely</p>
<p>motive for Natasha&rsquo;s murder than just a random robbery.</p>
<p>Police have their reasons for thinking this, but the details that back up that theory are</p>
<p>completely off the record.</p>
<p>So we just don&rsquo;t know what they found out since 2008 that makes them think that.</p>
<p>What police did tell us, though, is that Natasha&rsquo;s body was too badly decomposed when it was found,</p>
<p>so they were unable to get any sexual assault determination from a post-mortem exam.</p>
<p>The results from what forensic swabs they did submit were inconclusive.</p>
<p>In 2015, evidence technicians cut apart Natasha&rsquo;s car and did forensic tests to see if they could</p>
<p>lift any skin cell tissues.</p>
<p>They remained tight-lipped about what they found, but whatever it was, it didn&rsquo;t match</p>
<p>the teen suspects, nor anyone else whose DNA is in national or local databases.</p>
<p>A male fingerprint on Natasha&rsquo;s car was also lifted and preserved,</p>
<p>but it didn&rsquo;t match anyone.</p>
<p>Not her fianc√©, not anyone in her family, no one close to her.</p>
<p>Investigators think that the fingerprint could belong to the killer, or it could belong to</p>
<p>anyone else who had contact with the car prior to the murder.</p>
<p>I mean, the car had not been washed leading up to the crime,</p>
<p>so who knows how old the fingerprint was.</p>
<p>Dottie says despite all the near misses and lack of corroborating evidence,</p>
<p>Natasha&rsquo;s case is still solvable.</p>
<p>She firmly believes that there is someone out there who has a small piece of information</p>
<p>that could help solve it.</p>
<p>The leads are there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a matter of getting whoever in the community that knows about the case,</p>
<p>that knows Natasha, that may have some information of who they think may have had</p>
<p>last interaction with her, to come forward and let us know.</p>
<p>Detectives have gone as far as regularly searching national crime databases to try</p>
<p>and find patterns for similar murders.</p>
<p>But so far, they&rsquo;ve never come across one that perfectly matches Natasha&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>There are highway murders daily in the United States.</p>
<p>But according to Richland County, there were none before, nor have there been any since,</p>
<p>that were done in the same manner as Natasha&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Even the thought that Natasha could have died at the hands of a random violent predator</p>
<p>scares Dottie.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why she urges anyone listening, or who learns about Natasha&rsquo;s case,</p>
<p>to contact her department if you have any information.</p>
<p>If you even think you suspect something, call us.</p>
<p>Let us run it down.</p>
<p>Let us see if it works with what we already have.</p>
<p>Whatever you can give to us, don&rsquo;t think that you&rsquo;re worrying us,</p>
<p>or that it&rsquo;s silly, or anything else.</p>
<p>Just simply think about Natasha&rsquo;s little boys are growing up without a mom.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t have their mom there on their wedding.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t have mom there for graduation from high school.</p>
<p>And so many events that they have missed having their mother.</p>
<p>And it would be nice to at least give them the opportunity</p>
<p>to find out who did this to their mom.</p>
<p>Natasha&rsquo;s sons are teenagers now.</p>
<p>And even though they were so young when their mother was killed,</p>
<p>her sister Adrienne says that they still remember her.</p>
<p>They remember her taking them to the beach and to Chuck E. Cheese.</p>
<p>Adrienne says that her family will see news stories</p>
<p>about cold cases getting solved after 20 years,</p>
<p>thanks to DNA or a tip.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s still holding out hope that one day that will be the case for them.</p>
<p>Thinking about her family and even what Natasha&rsquo;s life would be like today</p>
<p>keeps detectives like Dottie motivated to find resolution</p>
<p>and give Adrienne and everyone else in Natasha&rsquo;s life closure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure she would be very successful.</p>
<p>The kind of person you would want in your hospital room.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just very, very frustrating.</p>
<p>Adrienne says that if she ever gets to confront her sister&rsquo;s killer,</p>
<p>she only has one question.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Help the Warren family find some peace in the way of answers.</p>
<p>Please, if you know anything about the 2008 murder of Natasha Warren,</p>
<p>call the Richland County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department in Columbia, South Carolina</p>
<p>at 803-576-3000.</p>
<p>Or you can call South Carolina Crime Stoppers</p>
<p>at 888-CRIME-SC.</p>
