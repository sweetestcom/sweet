    <p>The following is a conversation with Jaron Lanier,</p>
<p>a computer scientist, visual artist, philosopher,</p>
<p>writer, futurist, musician,</p>
<p>and the founder of the field of virtual reality.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>As a side note,</p>
<p>you may know that Jaron is a staunch critic</p>
<p>of social media platforms.</p>
<p>Him and I agree on many aspects of this,</p>
<p>except perhaps I am more optimistic</p>
<p>about it being possible to build better platforms.</p>
<p>And better artificial intelligence systems</p>
<p>that put longterm interests</p>
<p>and happiness of human beings first.</p>
<p>Let me also say a general comment about these conversations.</p>
<p>I try to make sure I prepare well,</p>
<p>remove my ego from the picture,</p>
<p>and focus on making the other person shine</p>
<p>as we try to explore the most beautiful</p>
<p>and insightful ideas in their mind.</p>
<p>This can be challenging</p>
<p>when the ideas that are close to my heart</p>
<p>are being criticized.</p>
<p>In those cases, I do offer a little pushback,</p>
<p>but respectfully, and then move on,</p>
<p>trying to have the other person come out</p>
<p>looking wiser in the exchange.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s no such thing as winning in conversations,</p>
<p>nor in life.</p>
<p>My goal is to learn and to have fun.</p>
<p>I ask that you don&rsquo;t see my approach</p>
<p>to these conversations as weakness.</p>
<p>It is not.</p>
<p>It is my attempt at showing respect</p>
<p>and love for the other person.</p>
<p>That said, I also often just do a bad job of talking,</p>
<p>but you probably already knew that.</p>
<p>So please give me a pass on that as well.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with Jaron Lanier.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re considered the founding father of virtual reality.</p>
<p>Do you think we will one day spend most</p>
<p>or all of our lives in virtual reality worlds?</p>
<p>I have always found the very most valuable moment</p>
<p>in virtual reality to be the moment</p>
<p>when you take off the headset and your senses are refreshed</p>
<p>and you perceive physicality afresh,</p>
<p>as if you were a newborn baby,</p>
<p>but with a little more experience.</p>
<p>So you can really notice just how incredibly strange</p>
<p>and delicate and peculiar and impossible the real world is.</p>
<p>So the magic is, and perhaps forever will be</p>
<p>in the physical world.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s my take on it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just me.</p>
<p>I mean, I think I don&rsquo;t get to tell everybody else</p>
<p>how to think or how to experience virtual reality.</p>
<p>And at this point, there have been multiple generations</p>
<p>of younger people who&rsquo;ve come along and liberated me</p>
<p>from having to worry about these things.</p>
<p>But I should say also even in what some,</p>
<p>well, I called it mixed reality,</p>
<p>back in the day, and these days it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>augmented reality, but with something like a HoloLens,</p>
<p>even then, like one of my favorite things</p>
<p>is to augment a forest, not because I think the forest</p>
<p>needs augmentation, but when you look at the augmentation</p>
<p>next to a real tree, the real tree just pops out</p>
<p>as being astounding, it&rsquo;s interactive,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s changing slightly all the time if you pay attention,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard to pay attention to that,</p>
<p>but when you compare it to virtual reality,</p>
<p>all of a sudden you do.</p>
<p>And even in practical applications,</p>
<p>my favorite early application of virtual reality,</p>
<p>which we prototyped going back to the 80s</p>
<p>when I was working with Dr. Joe Rosen at Stanford Med</p>
<p>near where we are now, we made the first surgical simulator.</p>
<p>And to go from the fake anatomy of the simulation,</p>
<p>which is incredibly valuable for many things,</p>
<p>for designing procedures, for training,</p>
<p>for all kinds of things, then to go to the real world</p>
<p>is then to go to the real person,</p>
<p>boy, it&rsquo;s really something like surgeons</p>
<p>really get woken up by that transition, it&rsquo;s very cool.</p>
<p>So I think the transition is actually more valuable</p>
<p>than the simulation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating, I never really thought about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost, it&rsquo;s like traveling elsewhere</p>
<p>in the physical space can help you appreciate</p>
<p>how much you value your home once you return.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s how I take it.</p>
<p>I mean, once again, people have different attitudes</p>
<p>towards it, all are welcome.</p>
<p>What do you think is the difference</p>
<p>between the virtual world and the physical meat space world</p>
<p>that you are still drawn, for you personally,</p>
<p>still drawn to the physical world?</p>
<p>Like there clearly then is a distinction.</p>
<p>Is there some fundamental distinction</p>
<p>or is it the peculiarities of the current set of technology?</p>
<p>In terms of the kind of virtual reality that we have now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s made of software and software is terrible stuff.</p>
<p>Software is always the slave of its own history,</p>
<p>its own legacy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always infinitely arbitrarily messy and arbitrary.</p>
<p>Working with it brings out a certain kind</p>
<p>of nerdy personality in people, or at least in me,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m not that fond of.</p>
<p>And there are all kinds of things about software</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s different from the physical world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something we understand, as you just pointed out.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I&rsquo;m a little mystified</p>
<p>when people ask me, well,</p>
<p>do you think the universe is a computer?</p>
<p>And I have to say, well, I mean,</p>
<p>what on earth could you possibly mean</p>
<p>if you say it isn&rsquo;t a computer?</p>
<p>If it isn&rsquo;t a computer,</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t follow principles consistently</p>
<p>and it wouldn&rsquo;t be intelligible</p>
<p>because what else is a computer ultimately?</p>
<p>I mean, and we have physics, we have technology,</p>
<p>so we can do technology so we can program it.</p>
<p>So, I mean, of course it&rsquo;s some kind of computer,</p>
<p>but I think trying to understand it as a Turing machine</p>
<p>is probably a foolish approach.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s the question, whether it performs,</p>
<p>this computer we call the universe,</p>
<p>performs the kind of computation that can be modeled</p>
<p>as a universal Turing machine,</p>
<p>or is it something much more fancy,</p>
<p>so fancy, in fact, that it may be</p>
<p>beyond our cognitive capabilities to understand?</p>
<p>Turing machines are kind of,</p>
<p>I call them teases in a way,</p>
<p>because if you have an infinitely smart programmer</p>
<p>with an infinite amount of time,</p>
<p>an infinite amount of memory,</p>
<p>and an infinite clock speed, then they&rsquo;re universal,</p>
<p>but that cannot exist.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not universal in practice.</p>
<p>And they actually are, in practice,</p>
<p>a very particular sort of machine within the constraints,</p>
<p>within the conservation principles of any reality</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s worth being in, probably.</p>
<p>And so I think universality of a particular model</p>
<p>is probably a deceptive way to think,</p>
<p>even though at some sort of limit,</p>
<p>of course something like that&rsquo;s gotta be true</p>
<p>at some sort of high enough limit,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just not accessible to us, so what&rsquo;s the point?</p>
<p>Well, to me, the question of whether we&rsquo;re living</p>
<p>inside a computer or a simulation</p>
<p>is interesting in the following way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a technical question that&rsquo;s here.</p>
<p>How difficult is it to build a machine,</p>
<p>not that simulates the universe,</p>
<p>but that makes it sufficiently realistic</p>
<p>that we wouldn&rsquo;t know the difference,</p>
<p>or better yet, sufficiently realistic</p>
<p>that we would kinda know the difference,</p>
<p>but we would prefer to stay in the virtual world anyway?</p>
<p>I wanna give you a few different answers.</p>
<p>I wanna give you the one that I think</p>
<p>has the most practical importance</p>
<p>to human beings right now,</p>
<p>which is that there&rsquo;s a kind of an assertion</p>
<p>sort of built into the way the questions usually asked</p>
<p>that I think is false, which is a suggestion</p>
<p>that people have a fixed level of ability</p>
<p>to perceive reality in a given way.</p>
<p>And actually, people are always learning,</p>
<p>evolving, forming themselves.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re fluid, too.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also programmable, self programmable,</p>
<p>changing, adapting.</p>
<p>And so my favorite way to get at this</p>
<p>is to talk about the history of other media.</p>
<p>So for instance, there was a peer review paper</p>
<p>that showed that an early wire recorder</p>
<p>playing back an opera singer behind a curtain</p>
<p>was indistinguishable from a real opera singer.</p>
<p>And so now, of course, to us,</p>
<p>it would not only be distinguishable,</p>
<p>but it would be very blatant</p>
<p>because the recording would be horrible.</p>
<p>But to the people at the time,</p>
<p>without the experience of it, it seemed plausible.</p>
<p>There was an early demonstration</p>
<p>of extremely crude video teleconferencing</p>
<p>between New York and DC in the 30s, I think so,</p>
<p>that people viewed as being absolutely realistic</p>
<p>and indistinguishable, which to us would be horrible.</p>
<p>And there are many other examples.</p>
<p>Another one, one of my favorite ones,</p>
<p>is in the Civil War era,</p>
<p>there were itinerant photographers</p>
<p>who collected photographs of people</p>
<p>who just looked kind of like a few archetypes.</p>
<p>So you could buy a photo of somebody</p>
<p>who looked kind of like your loved one</p>
<p>to remind you of that person</p>
<p>because actually photographing them was inconceivable</p>
<p>and hiring a painter was too expensive</p>
<p>and you didn&rsquo;t have any way for the painter</p>
<p>to represent them remotely anyway.</p>
<p>How would they even know what they looked like?</p>
<p>So these are all great examples</p>
<p>of how in the early days of different media,</p>
<p>we perceived the media as being really great,</p>
<p>but then we evolved through the experience of the media.</p>
<p>This gets back to what I was saying.</p>
<p>Maybe the greatest gift of photography</p>
<p>is that we can see the flaws in a photograph</p>
<p>and appreciate reality more.</p>
<p>Maybe the greatest gift of audio recording</p>
<p>is that we can distinguish that opera singer now</p>
<p>from that recording of the opera singer</p>
<p>on the horrible wire recorder.</p>
<p>So we shouldn&rsquo;t limit ourselves</p>
<p>by some assumption of stasis that&rsquo;s incorrect.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first thing, that&rsquo;s my first answer,</p>
<p>which is I think the most important one.</p>
<p>Now, of course, somebody might come back and say,</p>
<p>oh, but you know, technology can go so far.</p>
<p>There must be some point at which it would surpass.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a different question.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s also an interesting question,</p>
<p>but I think the answer I just gave you</p>
<p>is actually the more important answer</p>
<p>to the more important question.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s profound, yeah.</p>
<p>But can you, the second question,</p>
<p>which you&rsquo;re now making me realize is way different.</p>
<p>Is it possible to create worlds</p>
<p>in which people would want to stay</p>
<p>instead of the real world?</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>Like, en masse, like large numbers of people.</p>
<p>What I hope is, you know, as I said before,</p>
<p>I hope that the experience of virtual worlds</p>
<p>helps people appreciate this physical world we have</p>
<p>and feel tender towards it</p>
<p>and keep it from getting too fucked up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my hope.</p>
<p>Do you see all technology in that way?</p>
<p>So basically technology helps us appreciate</p>
<p>the more sort of technology free aspect of life.</p>
<p>Well, media technology.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, you can stretch that.</p>
<p>I mean, you can, let me say,</p>
<p>I could definitely play McLuhan</p>
<p>and turn this into a general theory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s totally doable.</p>
<p>The program you just described is totally doable.</p>
<p>In fact, I will psychically predict</p>
<p>that if you did the research,</p>
<p>you could find 20 PhD theses that do that already.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but they might exist.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know how much value there is</p>
<p>in pushing a particular idea that far.</p>
<p>Claiming that reality isn&rsquo;t a computer in some sense</p>
<p>seems incoherent to me because we can program it.</p>
<p>We have technology.</p>
<p>It seems to obey physical laws.</p>
<p>What more do you want from it to be a computer?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a computer of some kind.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know exactly what kind.</p>
<p>We might not know how to think about it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re working on it, but.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt, but you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s my fascination with the AI as well,</p>
<p>is it helps, in the case of AI,</p>
<p>I see it as a set of techniques</p>
<p>that help us understand ourselves, understand us humans.</p>
<p>In the same way, virtual reality,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re putting it brilliantly,</p>
<p>which it&rsquo;s a way to help us understand reality,</p>
<p>appreciate and open our eyes more richly to reality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly how I see it.</p>
<p>And I wish people who become incredibly fascinated,</p>
<p>who go down the rabbit hole of the different fascinations</p>
<p>with whether we&rsquo;re in a simulation or not,</p>
<p>or, you know, there&rsquo;s a whole world of variations on that.</p>
<p>I wish they&rsquo;d step back</p>
<p>and think about their own motivations</p>
<p>and exactly what they mean, you know?</p>
<p>And I think the danger with these things is,</p>
<p>so if you say, is the universe</p>
<p>some kind of computer broadly,</p>
<p>it has to be because it&rsquo;s not coherent to say that it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>On the other hand, to say that that means</p>
<p>you know anything about what kind of computer,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something very different.</p>
<p>And the same thing is true for the brain.</p>
<p>The same thing is true for anything</p>
<p>where you might use computational metaphors.</p>
<p>Like, we have to have a bit of modesty about where we stand.</p>
<p>And the problem I have with these framings of computation</p>
<p>is these ultimate cosmic questions</p>
<p>is that it has a way of getting people</p>
<p>to pretend they know more than they do.</p>
<p>Can you maybe, this is a therapy session,</p>
<p>psychoanalyze me for a second.</p>
<p>I really liked the Elder Scrolls series.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a role playing game, Skyrim, for example.</p>
<p>Why do I enjoy so deeply just walking around that world?</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s people and you could talk to</p>
<p>and you can just like, it&rsquo;s an escape.</p>
<p>But you know, my life is awesome.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m truly happy, but I also am happy</p>
<p>with the music that&rsquo;s playing in the mountains</p>
<p>and carrying around a sword and just that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very pleasant though to go there.</p>
<p>And I miss it sometimes.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s wonderful to love artistic creations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wonderful to love contact with other people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wonderful to love play and ongoing evolving</p>
<p>meaning and patterns with other people.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like anti tech</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m certainly not anti digital tech.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m anti, as everybody knows by now,</p>
<p>I think the manipulative economy of social media</p>
<p>is making everybody nuts and all that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m anti that stuff.</p>
<p>But the core of it, of course, I worked for many, many years</p>
<p>on trying to make that stuff happen</p>
<p>because I think it can be beautiful.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t like, why not?</p>
<p>And by the way, there&rsquo;s a thing about humans,</p>
<p>which is we&rsquo;re problematic.</p>
<p>Any kind of social interaction with other people</p>
<p>is gonna have its problems.</p>
<p>People are political and tricky.</p>
<p>And like, I love classical music,</p>
<p>but when you actually go to a classical music thing</p>
<p>and it turns out, oh, actually,</p>
<p>this is like a backroom power deal kind of place</p>
<p>and a big status ritual as well.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of not as fun.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of the package.</p>
<p>And the thing is, it&rsquo;s always going to be,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always gonna be a mix of things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the search for purity</p>
<p>is gonna get you anywhere.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not worried about that.</p>
<p>I worry about the really bad cases</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re making ourselves crazy or cruel enough</p>
<p>that we might not survive.</p>
<p>And I think the social media criticism rises to that level,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m glad you enjoy it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And I like that you basically say</p>
<p>that every experience has both beauty and darkness,</p>
<p>as in with classical music.</p>
<p>I also play classical piano, so I appreciate it very much.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, every, and even the darkness,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s search for meaning</p>
<p>with Viktor Frankl in the concentration camps.</p>
<p>Even there, there&rsquo;s opportunity to discover beauty.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the interesting thing about humans,</p>
<p>is the capacity to discover beautiful</p>
<p>in the darkest of moments,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s always the dark parts too.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it&rsquo;s our situation is structurally difficult.</p>
<p>We are, no, it is, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>We perceive socially, we depend on each other</p>
<p>for our sense of place and perception of the world.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re dependent on each other.</p>
<p>And yet there&rsquo;s also a degree in which we&rsquo;re inevitably,</p>
<p>we never really let each other down.</p>
<p>We are set up to be competitive as well as supportive.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just our fundamental situation</p>
<p>is complicated and challenging,</p>
<p>and I wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about one of the most challenging things.</p>
<p>One of the things I unfortunately am very afraid of</p>
<p>being human, allegedly.</p>
<p>You wrote an essay on death and consciousness</p>
<p>in which you write a note.</p>
<p>Certainly the fear of death</p>
<p>has been one of the greatest driving forces</p>
<p>in the history of thought</p>
<p>and in the formation of the character of civilization.</p>
<p>And yet it is under acknowledged.</p>
<p>The great book on the subject,</p>
<p>The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker</p>
<p>deserves a reconsideration.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Russian, so I have to ask you about this.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of death in life?</p>
<p>See, you would have enjoyed coming to our house</p>
<p>because my wife is Russian and we also have,</p>
<p>we have a piano of such spectacular qualities,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t, you would have freaked out.</p>
<p>But anyway, we&rsquo;ll let all that go.</p>
<p>So the context in which,</p>
<p>I remember that essay sort of,</p>
<p>this was from maybe the 90s or something.</p>
<p>And I used to publish in a journal</p>
<p>called the Journal of Consciousness Studies</p>
<p>because I was interested in these endless debates</p>
<p>about consciousness and science,</p>
<p>which certainly continue today.</p>
<p>And I was interested in how the fear of death</p>
<p>and the denial of death played into</p>
<p>different philosophical approaches to consciousness.</p>
<p>Because I think on the one hand,</p>
<p>the sort of sentimental school of dualism,</p>
<p>meaning the feeling that there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>apart from the physical brain,</p>
<p>some kind of soul or something else,</p>
<p>is obviously motivated in a sense</p>
<p>by a hope that whatever that is</p>
<p>will survive death and continue.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very core aspect of a lot of the world religions,</p>
<p>not all of them, not really, but most of them.</p>
<p>The thing I noticed is that the opposite of those,</p>
<p>which might be the sort of hardcore,</p>
<p>no, the brain&rsquo;s a computer and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>In a sense, we&rsquo;re motivated in the same way</p>
<p>with a remarkably similar chain of arguments,</p>
<p>which is no, the brain&rsquo;s a computer</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna figure it out in my lifetime</p>
<p>and upload myself and I&rsquo;ll live forever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s like the implied thought, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, and so it&rsquo;s kind of this,</p>
<p>in a funny way, it&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s peculiar to notice that these people</p>
<p>who would appear to be opposites in character</p>
<p>and cultural references and in their ideas</p>
<p>actually are remarkably similar.</p>
<p>And to an incredible degree,</p>
<p>this sort of hardcore computationalist idea</p>
<p>about the brain has turned into medieval Christianity</p>
<p>with together, like there&rsquo;s the people who are afraid</p>
<p>that if you have the wrong thought,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll piss off the super AIs of the future</p>
<p>who will come back and zap you and all that stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really turned into medieval Christianity</p>
<p>all over again.</p>
<p>This is so the Ernest Becker&rsquo;s idea that death,</p>
<p>the fear of death is the warm at the core,</p>
<p>which is like, that&rsquo;s the core motivator</p>
<p>of everything we see humans have created.</p>
<p>The question is if that fear of mortality is somehow core,</p>
<p>is like a prerequisite to consciousness.</p>
<p>You just moved across this vast cultural chasm</p>
<p>that separates me from most of my colleagues in a way.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t answer what you just said on the level</p>
<p>without this huge deconstruction.</p>
<p>Should I do it?</p>
<p>Yes, what&rsquo;s the chasm?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let us travel across this vast chasm.</p>
<p>Okay, I don&rsquo;t believe in AI.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any AI.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just algorithms, we make them, we control them.</p>
<p>Now, they&rsquo;re tools, they&rsquo;re not creatures.</p>
<p>Now, this is something that robs a lot of people,</p>
<p>the wrong way, and don&rsquo;t I know it.</p>
<p>When I was young, my main mentor was Marvin Minsky,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the principal author of the computer</p>
<p>as creature rhetoric that we still use.</p>
<p>He was the first person to have the idea at all,</p>
<p>but he certainly populated AI culture</p>
<p>with most of its tropes, I would say,</p>
<p>because a lot of the people will say,</p>
<p>oh, did you hear this new idea about AI?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, yeah, I heard it in 1978.</p>
<p>Sure, yeah, I remember that.</p>
<p>So Marvin was really the person.</p>
<p>And Marvin and I used to argue all the time about this stuff</p>
<p>because I always rejected it.</p>
<p>And of all of his,</p>
<p>of all of his, I wasn&rsquo;t formally his student,</p>
<p>but I worked for him as a researcher,</p>
<p>but of all of his students and student like people</p>
<p>of his young adoptees,</p>
<p>I think I was the one who argued with him</p>
<p>about this stuff in particular, and he loved it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would have loved to hear that conversation.</p>
<p>It was fun.</p>
<p>Did you ever converse to a place?</p>
<p>Oh, no, no.</p>
<p>So the very last time I saw him, he was quite frail.</p>
<p>And I was in Boston, and I was going to the old house</p>
<p>in Brookline, his amazing house.</p>
<p>And one of our mutual friends said,</p>
<p>hey, listen, Marvin&rsquo;s so frail.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do the argument with him.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t argue about AI, you know?</p>
<p>And so I said, but Marvin loves that.</p>
<p>And so I showed up, and he&rsquo;s like, he was frail.</p>
<p>He looked up and he said, are you ready to argue?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s such an amazing person for that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard to summarize this</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s decades of stuff.</p>
<p>The first thing to say is that nobody can claim</p>
<p>absolute knowledge about whether somebody</p>
<p>or something else is conscious or not.</p>
<p>This is all a matter of faith.</p>
<p>And in fact, I think the whole idea of faith</p>
<p>needs to be updated.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not about God,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just about stuff in the universe.</p>
<p>We have faith in each other, being conscious.</p>
<p>And then I used to frame this</p>
<p>as a thing called the circle of empathy in my old papers.</p>
<p>And then it turned into a thing</p>
<p>for the animal rights movement too.</p>
<p>I noticed Peter Singer using it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it was coincident or,</p>
<p>but anyway, there&rsquo;s this idea</p>
<p>that you draw a circle around yourself</p>
<p>and the stuff inside is more like you,</p>
<p>might be conscious, might be deserving of your empathy,</p>
<p>of your consideration,</p>
<p>and the stuff outside the circle isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And outside the circle might be a rock or,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And that circle is fundamentally based on faith.</p>
<p>Well, if you don&rsquo;t know it.</p>
<p>Your faith in what is and what isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The thing about this circle is it can&rsquo;t be pure faith.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a pragmatic decision</p>
<p>and this is where things get complicated.</p>
<p>If you try to make it too big,</p>
<p>you suffer from incompetence.</p>
<p>If you say, I don&rsquo;t wanna kill a bacteria,</p>
<p>I will not brush my teeth.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, like, what do you do?</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s a competence question</p>
<p>where you do have to draw the line.</p>
<p>People who make it too small become cruel.</p>
<p>People are so clannish and political</p>
<p>and so worried about themselves ending up</p>
<p>on the bottom of society</p>
<p>that they are always ready to gang up</p>
<p>on some designated group.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s always these people who are being,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re always trying to shove somebody out of the circle.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>So aren&rsquo;t you shoving AI outside the circle?</p>
<p>Well, give me a second.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a pragmatic consideration here.</p>
<p>And so, and the biggest questions</p>
<p>are probably fetuses and animals lately,</p>
<p>but AI is getting there.</p>
<p>Now with AI, I think,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve had this discussion so many times.</p>
<p>People say, but aren&rsquo;t you afraid if you exclude AI,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be cruel to some consciousness?</p>
<p>And then I would say, well, if you include AI,</p>
<p>you make yourself, you exclude yourself</p>
<p>from being able to be a good engineer or designer.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re facing incompetence immediately.</p>
<p>So like, I really think we need to subordinate algorithms</p>
<p>and be much more skeptical of them.</p>
<p>Your intuition, you speak about this brilliantly</p>
<p>with social media, how things can go wrong.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it possible to design systems</p>
<p>that show compassion, not to manipulate you,</p>
<p>but give you control and make your life better</p>
<p>if you so choose to, like grow together with systems.</p>
<p>And the way we grow with dogs and cats, with pets,</p>
<p>with significant others in that way,</p>
<p>they grow to become better people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why that&rsquo;s fundamentally not possible.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying oftentimes you get into trouble</p>
<p>by thinking you know what&rsquo;s good for people.</p>
<p>Well, look, there&rsquo;s this question</p>
<p>of what framework we&rsquo;re speaking in.</p>
<p>Do you know who Alan Watts was?</p>
<p>So Alan Watts once said, morality is like gravity</p>
<p>that in some absolute cosmic sense, there can&rsquo;t be morality</p>
<p>because at some point it all becomes relative</p>
<p>and who are we anyway?</p>
<p>Like morality is relative to us tiny creatures.</p>
<p>But here on earth, we&rsquo;re with each other,</p>
<p>this is our frame and morality is a very real thing.</p>
<p>Same thing with gravity.</p>
<p>At some point, you get into interstellar space</p>
<p>and you might not feel much of it, but here we are on earth.</p>
<p>And I think in the same sense,</p>
<p>I think this identification with a frame that&rsquo;s quite remote</p>
<p>cannot be separated from a feeling of wanting to feel</p>
<p>sort of separate from and superior to other people</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an impulse behind it that I really have to reject.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re just not competent yet</p>
<p>to talk about these kinds of absolutes.</p>
<p>Okay, so I agree with you that a lot of technologists</p>
<p>sort of lack this basic respect, understanding</p>
<p>and love for humanity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a separation there.</p>
<p>The thing I&rsquo;d like to push back against,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that you disagree,</p>
<p>but I believe you can create technologies</p>
<p>and you can create a new kind of technologist engineer</p>
<p>that does build systems that respect humanity,</p>
<p>not just respect, but admire humanity,</p>
<p>that have empathy for common humans, have compassion.</p>
<p>I mean, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I think, yeah, I mean, I think musical instruments</p>
<p>are a great example of that.</p>
<p>Musical instruments are technologies</p>
<p>that help people connect in fantastic ways.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a great example.</p>
<p>My invention or design during the pandemic period</p>
<p>was this thing called together mode</p>
<p>where people see themselves seated sort of</p>
<p>in a classroom or a theater instead of in squares.</p>
<p>And it allows them to semi consciously perform to each other</p>
<p>as if they have proper eye contact,</p>
<p>as if they&rsquo;re paying attention to each other nonverbally</p>
<p>and weirdly that turns out to work.</p>
<p>And so it promotes empathy so far as I can tell.</p>
<p>I hope it is of some use to somebody.</p>
<p>The AI idea isn&rsquo;t really new.</p>
<p>I would say it was born with Adam Smith&rsquo;s invisible hand</p>
<p>with this idea that we build this algorithmic thing</p>
<p>and it gets a bit beyond us</p>
<p>and then we think it must be smarter than us.</p>
<p>And the thing about the invisible hand</p>
<p>is absolutely everybody has some line they draw</p>
<p>where they say, no, no, no,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna take control of this thing.</p>
<p>They might have different lines,</p>
<p>they might care about different things,</p>
<p>but everybody ultimately became a Keynesian</p>
<p>because it just didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>It really wasn&rsquo;t that smart.</p>
<p>It was sometimes smart and sometimes it failed, you know?</p>
<p>And so if you really, you know,</p>
<p>people who really, really, really wanna believe</p>
<p>in the invisible hand is infinitely smart,</p>
<p>screw up their economies terribly.</p>
<p>You have to recognize the economy as a subservient tool.</p>
<p>Everybody does when it&rsquo;s to their advantage.</p>
<p>They might not when it&rsquo;s not to their advantage.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of an interesting game that happens.</p>
<p>But the thing is, it&rsquo;s just like that with our algorithms,</p>
<p>you know, like, you can have a sort of a Chicago,</p>
<p>you know, economic philosophy about your computer.</p>
<p>Say, no, no, no, my things come alive,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s smarter than anything.</p>
<p>I think that there is a deep loneliness within all of us.</p>
<p>This is what we seek, we seek love from each other.</p>
<p>I think AI can help us connect deeper.</p>
<p>Like this is what you criticize social media for.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s much better ways of doing social media</p>
<p>than doing social media that doesn&rsquo;t lead to manipulation,</p>
<p>but instead leads to deeper connection between humans,</p>
<p>leads to you becoming a better human being.</p>
<p>And what that requires is some agency on the part of AI</p>
<p>to be almost like a therapist, I mean, a companion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not telling you what&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not guiding you as if it&rsquo;s an all knowing thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just another companion that you can leave at any time.</p>
<p>You have complete transparency control over.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of mechanisms that you can have</p>
<p>that are counter to how current social media operates</p>
<p>that I think is subservient to humans,</p>
<p>or no, deeply respects human beings</p>
<p>and is empathetic to their experience</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s possible to create AI systems like that.</p>
<p>And I think they, I mean, that&rsquo;s a technical discussion</p>
<p>of whether they need to have something that looks like more,</p>
<p>something that looks like more like AI versus algorithms,</p>
<p>something that has a identity,</p>
<p>something that has a personality, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>AI systems, and you&rsquo;ve spoken extensively</p>
<p>how AI systems manipulate you within social networks.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the biggest problem,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t necessarily that there&rsquo;s advertisement</p>
<p>that social networks present you with advertisements</p>
<p>that then get you to buy stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the biggest problem.</p>
<p>The biggest problem is they then manipulate you.</p>
<p>They alter your human nature to get you to buy stuff</p>
<p>or to get you to do whatever the advertiser wants.</p>
<p>Or maybe you can correct me.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t see it quite that way,</p>
<p>but we can work with that as an approximation.</p>
<p>Sure, so my&hellip;</p>
<p>I think the actual thing is even sort of more ridiculous</p>
<p>and stupider than that, but that&rsquo;s okay, let&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>So my question is, let&rsquo;s not use the word AI,</p>
<p>but how do we fix it?</p>
<p>Oh, fixing social media,</p>
<p>that diverts us into this whole other field in my view,</p>
<p>which is economics,</p>
<p>which I always thought was really boring,</p>
<p>but we have no choice but to turn into economists</p>
<p>if we wanna fix this problem,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all about incentives.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve been around this thing since it started,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been in the meetings</p>
<p>where the social media companies sell themselves</p>
<p>to the people who put the most money into them,</p>
<p>which are usually the big advertising holding companies</p>
<p>and whatnot.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this idea that I think is kind of a fiction,</p>
<p>and maybe it&rsquo;s even been recognized as that by everybody,</p>
<p>that the algorithm will get really good</p>
<p>at getting people to buy something.</p>
<p>Because I think people have looked at their returns</p>
<p>and looked at what happens,</p>
<p>and everybody recognizes it&rsquo;s not exactly right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like a cognitive access blackmail payment</p>
<p>at this point.</p>
<p>Like just to be connected, you&rsquo;re paying the money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so much that the persuasion algorithms&hellip;</p>
<p>So Stanford renamed its program,</p>
<p>but it used to be called Engage Persuade.</p>
<p>The engage part works, the persuade part is iffy,</p>
<p>but the thing is that once people are engaged,</p>
<p>in order for you to exist as a business,</p>
<p>in order for you to be known at all,</p>
<p>you have to put money into the&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s dark.</p>
<p>Oh, no, that&rsquo;s not&hellip;</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work, but they have to&hellip;</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re still&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a giant cognitive access blackmail scheme</p>
<p>at this point.</p>
<p>So because the science behind the persuade part,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not entirely a failure,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not what&hellip;</p>
<p>We play make believe that it works more than it does.</p>
<p>The damage doesn&rsquo;t come&hellip;</p>
<p>Honestly, as I&rsquo;ve said in my books,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not anti advertising.</p>
<p>I actually think advertising can be demeaning</p>
<p>and annoying and banal and ridiculous</p>
<p>and take up a lot of our time with stupid stuff.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a lot of ways to criticize advertising</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s accurate and it can also lie and all kinds of things.</p>
<p>However, if I look at the biggest picture,</p>
<p>I think advertising, at least as it was understood</p>
<p>before social media, helped bring people into modernity</p>
<p>in a way that overall actually did benefit people overall.</p>
<p>And you might say, am I contradicting myself</p>
<p>because I was saying you shouldn&rsquo;t manipulate people?</p>
<p>Yeah, I am, probably here.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not pretending to have</p>
<p>this perfect airtight worldview without some contradictions.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a bit of a contradiction there, so.</p>
<p>Well, looking at the long arc of history,</p>
<p>advertisement has, in some parts, benefited society</p>
<p>because it funded some efforts that perhaps&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think like there&rsquo;s a thing</p>
<p>where sometimes I think it&rsquo;s actually been of some use.</p>
<p>Now, where the damage comes is a different thing though.</p>
<p>Social media, algorithms on social media</p>
<p>have to work on feedback loops</p>
<p>where they present you with stimulus</p>
<p>and they have to see if you respond to the stimulus.</p>
<p>Now, the problem is that the measurement mechanism</p>
<p>for telling if you respond in the engagement feedback loop</p>
<p>is very, very crude.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s things like whether you click more</p>
<p>or occasionally if you&rsquo;re staring at the screen more</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a forward facing camera that&rsquo;s activated,</p>
<p>but typically there isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So you have this incredibly crude back channel of information</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s crude enough that it only catches</p>
<p>sort of the more dramatic responses from you</p>
<p>and those are the fight or flight responses.</p>
<p>Those are the things where you get scared or pissed off</p>
<p>or aggressive or horny.</p>
<p>These are these ancient,</p>
<p>the sort of what are sometimes called the lizard brain</p>
<p>circuits or whatever, these fast response,</p>
<p>old, old, old evolutionary business circuits that we have</p>
<p>that are helpful in survival once in a while</p>
<p>but are not us at our best.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not who we wanna be.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not how we relate to each other.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re this old business.</p>
<p>So then just when you&rsquo;re engaged using those intrinsically</p>
<p>totally aside from whatever the topic is,</p>
<p>you start to get incrementally just a little bit</p>
<p>more paranoid, xenophobic, aggressive.</p>
<p>You get a little stupid and you become a jerk</p>
<p>and it happens slowly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like everybody&rsquo;s instantly transformed,</p>
<p>but it does kind of happen progressively</p>
<p>where people who get hooked kind of get drawn</p>
<p>more and more into this pattern of being at their worst.</p>
<p>Would you say that people are able to,</p>
<p>when they get hooked in this way,</p>
<p>look back at themselves from 30 days ago</p>
<p>and say, I am less happy with who I am now</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m not happy with who I am now</p>
<p>versus who I was 30 days ago.</p>
<p>Are they able to self reflect</p>
<p>when you take yourself outside of the lizard brain?</p>
<p>Sometimes.</p>
<p>I wrote a book about people suggesting people take a break</p>
<p>from their social media to see what happens</p>
<p>and maybe even, actually the title of the book</p>
<p>was just the arguments to delete your account.</p>
<p>Yeah, 10 arguments.</p>
<p>10 arguments.</p>
<p>Although I always said, I don&rsquo;t know that you should.</p>
<p>I can give you the arguments.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up to you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always very clear about that.</p>
<p>But you know, I get like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a social media account obviously</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not that easy for people to reach me.</p>
<p>They have to search out an old fashioned email address</p>
<p>on a super crappy antiquated website.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s actually a bit, I don&rsquo;t make it easy.</p>
<p>And even with that, I get this huge flood of mail</p>
<p>from people who say, oh, I quit my social media.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing so much better.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe how bad it was.</p>
<p>But the thing is, what&rsquo;s for me a huge flood of mail</p>
<p>would be an imperceptible trickle</p>
<p>from the perspective of Facebook, right?</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s rare for somebody</p>
<p>to look at themselves and say,</p>
<p>oh boy, I sure screwed myself over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really hard thing to ask of somebody.</p>
<p>None of us find that easy, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just hard.</p>
<p>The reason I asked this is,</p>
<p>is it possible to design social media systems</p>
<p>that optimize for some longer term metrics</p>
<p>of you being happy with yourself?</p>
<p>Well see, I don&rsquo;t think you should try</p>
<p>to engineer personal growth or happiness.</p>
<p>I think what you should do is design a system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just respectful of the people</p>
<p>and subordinates itself to the people</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t have perverse incentives.</p>
<p>And then at least there&rsquo;s a chance</p>
<p>of something decent happening.</p>
<p>You have to recommend stuff, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying like, be respectful.</p>
<p>What does that actually mean engineering wise?</p>
<p>Yeah, curation.</p>
<p>People have to be responsible.</p>
<p>Algorithms shouldn&rsquo;t be recommending.</p>
<p>Algorithms don&rsquo;t understand enough to recommend.</p>
<p>Algorithms are crap in this era.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sorry, they are.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying this as somebody</p>
<p>as a critic from the outside.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the middle of it.</p>
<p>I know what they can do.</p>
<p>I know the math.</p>
<p>I know what the corpora are.</p>
<p>I know the best ones.</p>
<p>Our office is funding GPT3 and all these things</p>
<p>that are at the edge of what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>And they do not have yet.</p>
<p>I mean, it still is statistical emergent pseudo semantics.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t actually have deep representation</p>
<p>emerging of anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not like, I mean that I&rsquo;m speaking the truth here</p>
<p>and you know it.</p>
<p>Well, let me push back on this.</p>
<p>This, there&rsquo;s several truths here.</p>
<p>So one, you&rsquo;re speaking to the way</p>
<p>certain companies operate currently.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s outside the realm</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s technically feasible to do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just not incentive,</p>
<p>like companies are not, why fix this thing?</p>
<p>I am aware that, for example, the YouTube search</p>
<p>and discovery has been very helpful to me.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a huge number of, there&rsquo;s so many videos</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s nice to have a little bit of help.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m still in control.</p>
<p>Let me ask you something.</p>
<p>Have you done the experiment of letting YouTube</p>
<p>recommend videos to you either starting</p>
<p>from a absolutely anonymous random place</p>
<p>where it doesn&rsquo;t know who you are</p>
<p>or from knowing who you or somebody else is</p>
<p>and then going 15 or 20 hops?</p>
<p>Have you ever done that and just let it go</p>
<p>top video recommend and then just go 20 hops?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ve not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done that many times now.</p>
<p>I have, because of how large YouTube is</p>
<p>and how widely it&rsquo;s used,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to get to enough scale</p>
<p>to get a statistically solid result on this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done it with high school kids,</p>
<p>with dozens of kids doing it at a time.</p>
<p>Every time I&rsquo;ve done an experiment,</p>
<p>the majority of times after about 17 or 18 hops,</p>
<p>you end up in really weird, paranoid, bizarre territory.</p>
<p>Because ultimately, that is the stuff</p>
<p>the algorithm rewards the most</p>
<p>because of the feedback crudeness I was just talking about.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying that the video</p>
<p>never recommends something cool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that its fundamental core</p>
<p>is one that promotes a paranoid style</p>
<p>that promotes increasing irritability,</p>
<p>that promotes xenophobia, promotes fear, anger,</p>
<p>promotes selfishness, promotes separation between people.</p>
<p>And the thing is, it&rsquo;s very hard to do this work solidly.</p>
<p>Many have repeated this experiment</p>
<p>and yet it still is kind of anecdotal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to do a large citizen science thing sometime</p>
<p>and do it, but then I think the problem with that</p>
<p>is YouTube would detect it and then change it.</p>
<p>Yes, I love that kind of stuff on Twitter.</p>
<p>So Jack Dorsey has spoken about doing healthy conversations</p>
<p>on Twitter or optimizing for healthy conversations.</p>
<p>What that requires within Twitter</p>
<p>are most likely citizen experiments</p>
<p>of what does healthy conversation actually look like</p>
<p>and how do you incentivize those healthy conversations</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re describing what often happens</p>
<p>and what is currently happening.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;d like to argue is it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>to strive for healthy conversations,</p>
<p>not in a dogmatic way of saying,</p>
<p>I know what healthy conversations are and I will tell you.</p>
<p>I think one way to do this is to try to look around</p>
<p>at social, maybe not things that are officially social media,</p>
<p>but things where people are together online</p>
<p>and see which ones have more healthy conversations,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s hard to be completely objective</p>
<p>in that measurement, you can kind of, at least crudely.</p>
<p>You could do subjective annotation</p>
<p>like have a large crowd source annotation.</p>
<p>One that I&rsquo;ve been really interested in is GitHub</p>
<p>because it could change.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;ll always be, but for the most part,</p>
<p>GitHub has had a relatively quite low poison quotient.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a few things about GitHub</p>
<p>that are interesting.</p>
<p>One thing about it is that people have a stake in it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just empty status games.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actual code or there&rsquo;s actual stuff being done.</p>
<p>And I think as soon as you have a real world stake</p>
<p>in something, you have a motivation</p>
<p>to not screw up that thing.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s often missing</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no incentive for the person</p>
<p>to really preserve something.</p>
<p>If they get a little bit of attention</p>
<p>from dumping on somebody&rsquo;s TikTok or something,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t pay any price for it.</p>
<p>But you have to kind of get decent with people</p>
<p>when you have a shared stake, a little secret.</p>
<p>So GitHub does a bit of that.</p>
<p>GitHub is wonderful, yes.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m tempted to play the Jaren Becker at you,</p>
<p>which is that, so GitHub is currently is amazing.</p>
<p>But the thing is, if you have a stake,</p>
<p>then if it&rsquo;s a social media platform,</p>
<p>they can use the fact that you have a stake</p>
<p>to manipulate you because you want to preserve the stake.</p>
<p>So like, so like.</p>
<p>Right, well, this is why,</p>
<p>all right, this gets us into the economics.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this thing called data dignity</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been studying for a long time.</p>
<p>I wrote a book about an earlier version of it</p>
<p>called Who Owns the Future?</p>
<p>And the basic idea of it is that,</p>
<p>once again, this is a 30 year conversation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating topic.</p>
<p>Let me do the fastest version of this I can do.</p>
<p>The fastest way I know how to do this</p>
<p>is to compare two futures, all right?</p>
<p>So future one is then the normative one,</p>
<p>the one we&rsquo;re building right now.</p>
<p>And future two is gonna be data dignity, okay?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna use a particular population.</p>
<p>I live on the hill in Berkeley.</p>
<p>And one of the features about the hill</p>
<p>is that as the climate changes,</p>
<p>we might burn down and I&rsquo;ll lose our houses</p>
<p>or die or something.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s dangerous, you know, and it didn&rsquo;t used to be.</p>
<p>And so who keeps us alive?</p>
<p>Well, the city does.</p>
<p>The city does some things.</p>
<p>The electric company kind of sort of,</p>
<p>maybe hopefully better.</p>
<p>Individual people who own property</p>
<p>take care of their property.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all nice.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s this other middle layer,</p>
<p>which is fascinating to me,</p>
<p>which is that the groundskeepers</p>
<p>who work up and down that hill,</p>
<p>many of whom are not legally here,</p>
<p>many of whom don&rsquo;t speak English,</p>
<p>cooperate with each other</p>
<p>to make sure trees don&rsquo;t touch</p>
<p>to transfer fire easily from lot to lot.</p>
<p>They have this whole little web</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s keeping us safe.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know about this at first.</p>
<p>I just started talking to them</p>
<p>because they were out there during the pandemic.</p>
<p>And so I try to just see who are these people?</p>
<p>Who are these people who are keeping us alive?</p>
<p>Now, I want to talk about the two different phases</p>
<p>for those people in your future one and future two.</p>
<p>Future one, some weird like kindergarten paint job van</p>
<p>with all these like cameras and weird things,</p>
<p>drives up, observes what the gardeners</p>
<p>and groundskeepers are doing.</p>
<p>A few years later, some amazing robots</p>
<p>that can shimmy up trees and all this show up.</p>
<p>All those people are out of work</p>
<p>and there are these robots doing the thing</p>
<p>and the robots are good.</p>
<p>And they can scale to more land</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re actually good.</p>
<p>But then there are all these people out of work</p>
<p>and these people have lost dignity.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>And then somebody will say,</p>
<p>well, they go on basic income, whatever.</p>
<p>They become wards of the state.</p>
<p>My problem with that solution is every time in history</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve had some centralized thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s doling out the benefits,</p>
<p>that things get seized by people</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s too centralized and it gets seized.</p>
<p>This happened to every communist experiment I can find.</p>
<p>So I think that turns into a poor future</p>
<p>that will be unstable.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people will feel good in it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;ll be a political disaster</p>
<p>with a sequence of people seizing this central source</p>
<p>of the basic income.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll say, oh no, an algorithm can do it.</p>
<p>Then people will seize the algorithm.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll seize control.</p>
<p>Unless the algorithm is decentralized</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s impossible to seize the control.</p>
<p>Yeah, but 60 something people</p>
<p>own a quarter of all the Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Like the things that we think are decentralized</p>
<p>are not decentralized.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go to future two.</p>
<p>Future two, the gardeners see that van with all the cameras</p>
<p>and the kindergarten paint job,</p>
<p>and they say, the groundskeepers,</p>
<p>and they say, hey, the robots are coming.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to form a data union.</p>
<p>And amazingly, California has a little baby data union law</p>
<p>emerging in the books.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And so they say, we&rsquo;re going to form a data union</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to,</p>
<p>not only are we going to sell our data to this place,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re going to make it better than it would have been</p>
<p>if they were just grabbing it without our cooperation.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to improve it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to make the robots more effective.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to make them better</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to be proud of it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to become a new class of experts</p>
<p>that are respected.</p>
<p>And then here&rsquo;s the interesting,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two things that are different about that world</p>
<p>from future one.</p>
<p>One thing, of course, the people have more pride.</p>
<p>They have more sense of ownership, of agency,</p>
<p>but what the robots do changes.</p>
<p>Instead of just like this functional,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;ll figure out how to keep the neighborhood</p>
<p>from burning down,</p>
<p>you have this whole creative community</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t there before thinking,</p>
<p>well, how can we make these robots better</p>
<p>so we can keep on earning money?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be waves of creative groundskeeping</p>
<p>with spiral pumping, pumpkin patches</p>
<p>and waves of cultural things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be new ideas like,</p>
<p>wow, I wonder if we could do something</p>
<p>about climate change mitigation with how we do this.</p>
<p>What about, what about fresh water?</p>
<p>Can we, what about, can we make the food healthier?</p>
<p>What about, what about all of a sudden</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be this whole creative community on the case?</p>
<p>And isn&rsquo;t it nicer to have a high tech future</p>
<p>with more creative classes</p>
<p>than one with more dependent classes?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that a better future?</p>
<p>But, but, but, but, future one and future two</p>
<p>have the same robots and the same algorithms.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no technological difference.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only a human difference.</p>
<p>And that second future two, that&rsquo;s data dignity.</p>
<p>The economy that you&rsquo;re, I mean,</p>
<p>the game theory here is on the humans</p>
<p>and then the technology is just the tools</p>
<p>that enable both possibilities.</p>
<p>I mean, I think you can believe in AI</p>
<p>and be in future two.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s a little harder.</p>
<p>You have to do more contortions, it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>So in the case of social media,</p>
<p>what does data dignity look like?</p>
<p>Is it people getting paid for their data?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think what should happen is in the future</p>
<p>there should be massive data unions</p>
<p>for people putting content into the system</p>
<p>and those data unions should smooth out</p>
<p>the results a little bit.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not winner take all, but at the same time,</p>
<p>and people have to pay for it too.</p>
<p>They have to pay for Facebook</p>
<p>the way they pay for Netflix</p>
<p>with an allowance for the poor.</p>
<p>There has to be a way out too.</p>
<p>But the thing is people do pay for Netflix.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a going concern.</p>
<p>People pay for Xbox and PlayStation.</p>
<p>Like people, there&rsquo;s enough people</p>
<p>to pay for stuff they want.</p>
<p>This could happen too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that this precedent started</p>
<p>that moved it in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>And then what has to happen,</p>
<p>the economy is a measuring device.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s an honest measuring device,</p>
<p>the outcomes for people form a normal distribution,</p>
<p>a bell curve.</p>
<p>And then, so there should be a few people</p>
<p>who do really well, a lot of people who do okay.</p>
<p>And then we should have an expanding economy</p>
<p>reflecting more and more creativity and expertise</p>
<p>flowing through the network.</p>
<p>And that expanding economy moves the result</p>
<p>just a bit forward.</p>
<p>So more people are getting money out of it</p>
<p>than are putting money into it.</p>
<p>So it gradually expands the economy</p>
<p>and lifts all boats.</p>
<p>And the society has to support the lower wing</p>
<p>of the bell curve too, but not universal basic income.</p>
<p>It has to be for the,</p>
<p>cause if it&rsquo;s an honest economy,</p>
<p>there will be that lower wing</p>
<p>and we have to support those people.</p>
<p>There has to be a safety net.</p>
<p>But see what I believe, I&rsquo;m not gonna talk about AI,</p>
<p>but I will say that I think there&rsquo;ll be more</p>
<p>and more algorithms that are useful.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t think everybody&rsquo;s gonna be supplying data</p>
<p>to grounds keeping robots,</p>
<p>nor do I think everybody&rsquo;s gonna make their living</p>
<p>with TikTok videos.</p>
<p>I think in both cases,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be a rather small contingent</p>
<p>that do well enough at either of those things.</p>
<p>But I think there might be many, many, many,</p>
<p>many of those niches that start to evolve</p>
<p>as there are more and more algorithms,</p>
<p>more and more robots.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that large number that will create</p>
<p>the economic potential for a very large part of society</p>
<p>to become members of new creative classes.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to create a social network</p>
<p>that competes with Twitter and Facebook</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s large and centralized in this way?</p>
<p>Not centralized, sort of large, large.</p>
<p>How to get, all right, so I gotta tell you</p>
<p>how to get from where we are</p>
<p>to anything kind of in the zone</p>
<p>of what I&rsquo;m talking about is challenging.</p>
<p>I know some of the people who run,</p>
<p>like I know Jack Dorsey at H1N1,</p>
<p>and I view Jack as somebody who&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s really striving and searching</p>
<p>and trying to find a way to make it better,</p>
<p>but is kind of like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to do it while in flight</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s under enormous business pressure too.</p>
<p>So Jack Dorsey to me is a fascinating study</p>
<p>because I think his mind is in a lot of good places.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a good human being,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a big Titanic ship</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s already moving in one direction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know what to do with it.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the story of Twitter.</p>
<p>One of the things that I observed is that</p>
<p>if you just wanna look at the human side,</p>
<p>meaning like how are people being changed?</p>
<p>How do they feel?</p>
<p>What does the culture like?</p>
<p>Almost all of the social media platforms that get big</p>
<p>have an initial sort of honeymoon period</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re actually kind of sweet and cute.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like if you look at the early years of Twitter,</p>
<p>it was really sweet and cute,</p>
<p>but also look at Snap, TikTok.</p>
<p>And then what happens is as they scale</p>
<p>and the algorithms become more influential</p>
<p>instead of just the early people,</p>
<p>when it gets big enough that it&rsquo;s the algorithm running it,</p>
<p>then you start to see the rise of the paranoid style</p>
<p>and then they start to get dark.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen that shift in TikTok rather recently.</p>
<p>But I feel like that scaling reveals the flaws</p>
<p>within the incentives.</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m torturing you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not torture.</p>
<p>No, because I have hope for the world with humans</p>
<p>and I have hope for a lot of things that humans create,</p>
<p>including technology.</p>
<p>And I just, I feel it is possible to create</p>
<p>social media platforms that incentivize</p>
<p>different things than the current.</p>
<p>I think the current incentivization is around</p>
<p>like the dumbest possible thing that was invented</p>
<p>like 20 years ago, however long.</p>
<p>And it just works and so nobody&rsquo;s changing it.</p>
<p>I just think that there could be a lot of innovation</p>
<p>for more, see, you kind of push back this idea</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t know what longterm growth or happiness is.</p>
<p>If you give control to people to define</p>
<p>what their longterm happiness and goals are,</p>
<p>then that optimization can happen</p>
<p>for each of those individual people.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, imagine a future where</p>
<p>probably a lot of people would love to make their living</p>
<p>doing TikTok dance videos, but people recognize generally</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of hard to get into.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, dance crews have an experience</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very similar to programmers working together on GitHub.</p>
<p>So the future is like a cross between TikTok and GitHub</p>
<p>and they get together and they have rights.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re negotiating for returns.</p>
<p>They join different artists societies</p>
<p>in order to soften the blow of the randomness</p>
<p>of who gets the network effect benefit</p>
<p>because nobody can know that.</p>
<p>And I think an individual person</p>
<p>might join a thousand different data unions</p>
<p>in the course of their lives, or maybe even 10,000.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but the point is that we&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>like these very hedge distributed portfolios</p>
<p>of different data unions we&rsquo;re part of.</p>
<p>And some of them might just trickle in a little money</p>
<p>for nonsense stuff where we&rsquo;re contributing</p>
<p>to health studies or something.</p>
<p>But I think people will find their way.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll find their way to the right GitHub like community</p>
<p>in which they find their value in the context</p>
<p>of supplying inputs and data and taste</p>
<p>and correctives and all of this into the algorithms</p>
<p>and the robots of the future.</p>
<p>And that is a way to resist</p>
<p>the lizard brain based funding system mechanisms.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an alternate economic system</p>
<p>that rewards productivity, creativity,</p>
<p>value as perceived by others.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a genuine market.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not doled out from a center.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not some communist person deciding who&rsquo;s valuable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actual market.</p>
<p>And the money is made by supporting that</p>
<p>instead of just grabbing people&rsquo;s attention</p>
<p>in the cheapest possible way,</p>
<p>which is definitely how you get the lizard brain.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re finally at the agreement.</p>
<p>But I just think that&hellip;</p>
<p>So yeah, I&rsquo;ll tell you how I think to fix social media.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few things.</p>
<p>So one, I think people should have complete control</p>
<p>over their data and transparency of what that data is</p>
<p>and how it&rsquo;s being used if they do hand over the control.</p>
<p>Another thing they should be able to delete,</p>
<p>walk away with their data at any moment, easy.</p>
<p>Like with a single click of a button, maybe two buttons,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, just easily walk away with their data.</p>
<p>The other is control of the algorithm,</p>
<p>individualized control of the algorithm for them.</p>
<p>So each one has their own algorithm.</p>
<p>Each person has their own algorithm.</p>
<p>They get to be the decider of what they see in this world.</p>
<p>And to me, that&rsquo;s, I guess, fundamentally decentralized</p>
<p>in terms of the key decisions being made.</p>
<p>But if that&rsquo;s made transparent,</p>
<p>I feel like people will choose that system</p>
<p>over Twitter of today, over Facebook of today,</p>
<p>when they have the ability to walk away,</p>
<p>to control their data</p>
<p>and to control the kinds of things they see.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s walk away from the term AI.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>In this case, you have full control</p>
<p>of the algorithms that help you</p>
<p>if you want to use their help.</p>
<p>But you can also say a few to those algorithms</p>
<p>and just consume the raw, beautiful waterfall</p>
<p>of the internet.</p>
<p>I think that, to me, that&rsquo;s not only fixes social media,</p>
<p>but I think it would make a lot more money.</p>
<p>So I would like to challenge the idea.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re not presenting that,</p>
<p>but that the only way to make a ton of money</p>
<p>is to operate like Facebook is.</p>
<p>I think you can make more money by giving people control.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I certainly believe that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re definitely in the territory</p>
<p>of a wholehearted agreement here.</p>
<p>I do want to caution against one thing,</p>
<p>which is making a future that benefits programmers</p>
<p>versus this idea that people are in control of their data.</p>
<p>So years ago, I cofounded an advisory board for the EU</p>
<p>with a guy named Jay.</p>
<p>Giovanni Bottarelli, who passed away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the reasons I wanted to mention it.</p>
<p>A remarkable guy who&rsquo;d been,</p>
<p>he was originally a prosecutor</p>
<p>who was throwing mafioso in jail in Sicily.</p>
<p>So he was like this intense guy who was like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve dealt with death threats.</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg doesn&rsquo;t scare me or whatever.</p>
<p>So we worked on this path of saying,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s make it all about transparency and consent.</p>
<p>And it was one of the feeders that led to this huge data</p>
<p>privacy and protection framework in Europe called the GDPR.</p>
<p>And so therefore we&rsquo;ve been able to have empirical feedback</p>
<p>on how that goes.</p>
<p>And the problem is that most people actually get stymied</p>
<p>by the complexity of that kind of management.</p>
<p>They have trouble and reasonably so.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m like a techie.</p>
<p>I can go in and I can figure out what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>But most people really do.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a problem that it differentially benefits</p>
<p>those who kind of have a technical mindset</p>
<p>and can go in and sort of have a feeling</p>
<p>for how this stuff works.</p>
<p>I kind of still want to come back to incentives.</p>
<p>And so if the incentive for whoever is,</p>
<p>if the commercial incentive is to help the creative people</p>
<p>of the future make more money,</p>
<p>because you get a cut of it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you grow an economy.</p>
<p>Not the programmers.</p>
<p>Well, some of them will be programmers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not anti programmer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that it&rsquo;s not only programmers, you know?</p>
<p>So, yeah, you have to make sure the incentives are right.</p>
<p>I mean, I like control is an interface problem</p>
<p>to where you have to create something that&rsquo;s compelling</p>
<p>to everybody, to the creatives, to the public.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know, Creative Commons,</p>
<p>like the licensing, there&rsquo;s a bunch of legal speak</p>
<p>just in general, the whole legal profession.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice when it can be simplified</p>
<p>in the way that you can truly simply understand.</p>
<p>Everybody can simply understand the basics.</p>
<p>In the same way, it should be very simple to understand</p>
<p>how the data is being used</p>
<p>and what data is being used for people.</p>
<p>But then you&rsquo;re arguing that in order for that to happen,</p>
<p>you have to have the incentives alike.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of the reason that money works</p>
<p>is actually information hiding and information loss.</p>
<p>Like one of the things about money</p>
<p>is a particular dollar you get</p>
<p>might have passed through your enemy&rsquo;s hands</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know it.</p>
<p>But also, I mean, this is what Adam Smith,</p>
<p>if you wanna give the most charitable interpretation possible</p>
<p>to the invisible hand is what he was saying,</p>
<p>is that like there&rsquo;s this whole complicated thing</p>
<p>and not only do you not need to know about it,</p>
<p>the truth is you&rsquo;d never be able to follow it if you tried</p>
<p>and just like let the economic incentives</p>
<p>solve for this whole thing.</p>
<p>And that in a sense, every transaction</p>
<p>is like a neuron and a neural net.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;d had that metaphor, he would have used it</p>
<p>and let the whole thing settle to a solution</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>I think this idea of having incentives</p>
<p>that reduce complexity for people</p>
<p>can be made to work.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an example of an algorithm</p>
<p>that could be manipulative or not,</p>
<p>going back to your question before</p>
<p>about can you do it in a way that&rsquo;s not manipulative?</p>
<p>And I would say a GitHub like,</p>
<p>if you just have this vision,</p>
<p>GitHub plus TikTok combined, is it possible?</p>
<p>I think it is.</p>
<p>I really think it is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna be able to unsee that idea</p>
<p>of creatives on TikTok collaborating</p>
<p>in the same way that people on GitHub collaborate.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>I like that kind of version.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>I like it, I love it.</p>
<p>I just like, right now when people use,</p>
<p>by the way, father of teenage daughter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about TikTok, right?</p>
<p>So, when people use TikTok,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of, it&rsquo;s kind of funny,</p>
<p>I was gonna say cattiness,</p>
<p>but I was just using the cat</p>
<p>as this exemplar of what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>I contradict myself.</p>
<p>But anyway, there&rsquo;s all this cattiness</p>
<p>where people are like,</p>
<p>ee, this person&rsquo;s ee.</p>
<p>And I just, what about people getting together</p>
<p>and kind of saying,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re gonna work on this move.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna get a better,</p>
<p>can we get a better musician?</p>
<p>Like, and they do that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the part</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of off the books right now.</p>
<p>That should be like right there.</p>
<p>That should be the center.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the, that&rsquo;s the really best part.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s where the invention of Git period,</p>
<p>the versioning is brilliant.</p>
<p>And so some of the things</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>technology, algorithms, tools can empower.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing for humans to connect,</p>
<p>to collaborate and so on.</p>
<p>Can we upset more people a little bit?</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;d have to try.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Can we, can I ask you to elaborate?</p>
<p>Cause I, my intuition was that</p>
<p>you would be a supporter of something</p>
<p>like cryptocurrency and Bitcoin</p>
<p>because it is fundamentally emphasizes decentralization.</p>
<p>What do you, so can you elaborate?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, look.</p>
<p>Your thoughts on Bitcoin.</p>
<p>I, it&rsquo;s kind of funny.</p>
<p>Um, I, I wrote, I, I&rsquo;ve been advocating</p>
<p>some kind of digital currency for a long time.</p>
<p>And when the, the, uh, when, when Bitcoin came out</p>
<p>and the original paper on, on blockchain,</p>
<p>um, my heart kind of sank because I thought,</p>
<p>Oh my God, we&rsquo;re applying all of this fancy thought</p>
<p>and all these very careful distributed security</p>
<p>measures to recreate the gold standard.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just so retro.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so dysfunctional.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so useless from an economic point of view.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s always, and then the other thing</p>
<p>is using computational inefficiency</p>
<p>at a boundless scale as your form of security</p>
<p>is a crime against this atmosphere.</p>
<p>Obviously a lot of people know that now,</p>
<p>but we knew that at the start.</p>
<p>Like the thing is when the first paper came out,</p>
<p>I remember a lot of people saying,</p>
<p>Oh my God, I think this thing scales.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a carbon disaster, you know?</p>
<p>And, and, um, I, I just like, I&rsquo;m just mystified,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a different question than when you asked,</p>
<p>can you have, um, a cryptographic currency</p>
<p>or at least some kind of digital currency</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s of a benefit?</p>
<p>And absolutely.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m, and there are people who are trying</p>
<p>to be thoughtful about this.</p>
<p>You should, uh, if you haven&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you should interview, uh, Vitalik Buterin sometime.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve interviewed him twice.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So like there are people in the community</p>
<p>who are trying to be thoughtful</p>
<p>and trying to figure out how to do this better.</p>
<p>It has nice properties though, right?</p>
<p>So the, one of the nice properties is that</p>
<p>like government centralized, it&rsquo;s hard to control.</p>
<p>Uh, and then the other one to fix some of the issues</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re referring to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sort of playing devil&rsquo;s advocate here is,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s lightning network.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s ideas how to, how you, uh, build stuff</p>
<p>on top of Bitcoin, similar with gold</p>
<p>that allow you to have this kind of vibrant economy</p>
<p>that operates not on the blockchain,</p>
<p>but outside the blockchain.</p>
<p>And you use this, uh, Bitcoin for, uh, for like</p>
<p>checking the security of those transactions.</p>
<p>So Bitcoin&rsquo;s not new.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been around for a while.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching it closely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve not, I&rsquo;ve not seen one example of it</p>
<p>creating economic growth.</p>
<p>There was this obsession with the idea</p>
<p>that government was the problem,</p>
<p>that idea that government&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say government earned that wrath, honestly,</p>
<p>because if you look at some of the things</p>
<p>that governments have done in recent decades,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a pretty story.</p>
<p>Like, uh, after, uh, after a very small number</p>
<p>of people in the US government decided to bomb</p>
<p>in landmine Southeast Asia, it&rsquo;s hard to come back</p>
<p>and say, oh, government&rsquo;s this great thing.</p>
<p>But, uh, then the problem is that this resistance</p>
<p>to government is basically resistance to politics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way of saying, if I can get rich,</p>
<p>nobody should bother me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way of not, of not having obligations to others.</p>
<p>And that ultimately is a very suspect motivation.</p>
<p>But does that mean that the impulse that the government, um,</p>
<p>should not overreach its power is flawed?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, what I want to ask you to do</p>
<p>is to replace the word government with politics.</p>
<p>Like our politics is people having to deal with each other.</p>
<p>My theory about freedom is that the only authentic form</p>
<p>of freedom is perpetual annoyance.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So annoyance means you&rsquo;re actually dealing with people</p>
<p>because people are annoying.</p>
<p>Perpetual means that that annoyance is survivable</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t destroy us all.</p>
<p>So if you have perpetual annoyance,</p>
<p>then you have freedom.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s politics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s politics.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have perpetual annoyance,</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s gone very wrong and you&rsquo;ve suppressed those people</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s only temporary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to come back and be horrible.</p>
<p>You should seek perpetual annoyance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll invite you to a Berkeley city council meeting</p>
<p>so you can know what that feels like.</p>
<p>What perpetual annoyance feels like.</p>
<p>But anyway, so freedom is being&hellip;</p>
<p>The test of freedom is that you&rsquo;re annoyed by other people.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re not free.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re trapped in some temporary illusion</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to fall apart.</p>
<p>Now, this quest to avoid government</p>
<p>is really a quest to avoid that political feeling,</p>
<p>but you have to have it.</p>
<p>You have to deal with it.</p>
<p>And it sucks, but that&rsquo;s the human situation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the human condition.</p>
<p>And this idea that we&rsquo;re going to have this abstract thing</p>
<p>that protects us from having to deal with each other</p>
<p>is always an illusion.</p>
<p>The idea, and I apologize,</p>
<p>I overstretched the use of the word government.</p>
<p>The idea is there should be some punishment from the people</p>
<p>when a bureaucracy, when a set of people</p>
<p>or a particular leader, like in an authoritarian regime,</p>
<p>which more than half the world currently lives under,</p>
<p>if they become, they stop representing the people,</p>
<p>it stops being like a Berkeley meeting</p>
<p>and starts being more like a dictatorial kind of situation.</p>
<p>And so the point is, it&rsquo;s nice to give people,</p>
<p>the populace in a decentralized way,</p>
<p>power to resist that kind of government becoming over authoritarian.</p>
<p>Yeah, but people see this idea that the problem</p>
<p>is always the government being powerful is false.</p>
<p>The problem can also be criminal gangs.</p>
<p>The problem can also be weird cults.</p>
<p>The problem can be abusive clergy.</p>
<p>The problem can be infrastructure that fails.</p>
<p>The problem can be poisoned water.</p>
<p>The problem can be failed electric grids.</p>
<p>The problem can be a crappy education system</p>
<p>that makes the whole society less and less able to create value.</p>
<p>There are all these other problems</p>
<p>that are different from an overbearing government.</p>
<p>Like you have to keep some sense of perspective</p>
<p>and not be obsessed with only one kind of problem</p>
<p>because then the others will pop up.</p>
<p>But empirically speaking, some problems are bigger than others.</p>
<p>So like some groups of people,</p>
<p>like governments or gangs or companies lead to problems.</p>
<p>Are you a US citizen?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Has the government ever really been a problem for you?</p>
<p>Well, okay.</p>
<p>So first of all, I grew up in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Yeah, my wife did too.</p>
<p>So I have seen, and has the government bothered me?</p>
<p>I would say that that&rsquo;s a really complicated question,</p>
<p>especially because the United States is such,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a special place like a lot of other countries.</p>
<p>My wife&rsquo;s family were refused NICs.</p>
<p>And so we have like a very,</p>
<p>and her dad was sent to the Gulag.</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth on my father&rsquo;s side,</p>
<p>all but a few were killed by a pogrom</p>
<p>in a post Soviet pogrom in Ukraine.</p>
<p>So I would say because you did a little trick</p>
<p>of eloquent trick of language</p>
<p>that you switched to the United States</p>
<p>to talk about government.</p>
<p>So I believe unlike my friend,</p>
<p>Michael Malus, who&rsquo;s an anarchist,</p>
<p>I believe government can do a lot of good in the world.</p>
<p>That is exactly what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>which is it&rsquo;s politics.</p>
<p>The thing that Bitcoin folks and cryptocurrency folks argue</p>
<p>is that one of the big ways that government</p>
<p>can control the populace is centralized bank,</p>
<p>like control the money.</p>
<p>That was the case in the Soviet Union too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s inflation can really make poor people suffer.</p>
<p>And so what they argue is this is one way to go around</p>
<p>that power that government has</p>
<p>of controlling the monetary system.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a way to resist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not actually saying government bad.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s saying some of the ways</p>
<p>that central banks get into trouble</p>
<p>can be resisted through centralized.</p>
<p>So let me ask you on balance today in the real world</p>
<p>in terms of actual facts,</p>
<p>do you think cryptocurrencies are doing more</p>
<p>to prop up corrupt, murderous, horrible regimes</p>
<p>or to resist those regimes?</p>
<p>Where do you think the balance is right now?</p>
<p>I know exactly having talked to a lot of cryptocurrency folks</p>
<p>what they would tell me, right?</p>
<p>I, it&rsquo;s hard, it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t, no, no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking it as a real question.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to know the answer perfectly.</p>
<p>However, I gotta say, if you look at people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve been able to decode blockchains</p>
<p>and they do leak a lot of data.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not as secure as this widely thought.</p>
<p>There are a lot of unknown Bitcoin whales</p>
<p>from pretty early and they&rsquo;re huge.</p>
<p>And if you ask, who are these people?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s evidence that a lot of them are quite</p>
<p>not the people you&rsquo;d wanna support, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>And I just don&rsquo;t, like, I think empirically</p>
<p>this idea that there&rsquo;s some intrinsic way</p>
<p>that bad governments will be disempowered</p>
<p>and people will be able to resist them more</p>
<p>than new villains or even villainous governments</p>
<p>will be empowered.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no basis for that assertion.</p>
<p>It just is kind of circumstantial.</p>
<p>And I think in general, Bitcoin ownership is one thing,</p>
<p>but Bitcoin transactions have tended</p>
<p>to support criminality more than productivity.</p>
<p>Of course, they would argue that was the story</p>
<p>of its early days, that now more and more Bitcoin</p>
<p>is being used for legitimate transactions, but&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the difference.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say for legitimate transactions.</p>
<p>I said for economic growth, for creativity.</p>
<p>Like, I think what&rsquo;s happening is people are using it</p>
<p>a little bit for buying, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>maybe some of these companies make it available</p>
<p>for this and that, they buy a Tesla with it or something.</p>
<p>Investing in a startup hard, it might&rsquo;ve happened</p>
<p>a little bit, but it&rsquo;s not an engine of productivity,</p>
<p>creativity, and economic growth,</p>
<p>whereas old fashioned currency still is.</p>
<p>And anyway, look, I think something&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pro the idea of digital currencies.</p>
<p>I am anti the idea of economics wiping out politics</p>
<p>as a result.</p>
<p>I think they have to exist in some balance</p>
<p>to avoid the worst dysfunctions of each.</p>
<p>In some ways, there&rsquo;s parallels to our discussion</p>
<p>of algorithms and cryptocurrency is you&rsquo;re pro the idea,</p>
<p>but it can be used to manipulate,</p>
<p>you can be used poorly by aforementioned humans.</p>
<p>Well, I think that you can make better designs</p>
<p>and worse designs.</p>
<p>And the thing about cryptocurrency that&rsquo;s so interesting</p>
<p>is how many of us are responsible for the poor designs</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re all so hooked on that Horatio Alger story</p>
<p>on like, I&rsquo;m gonna be the one who gets the viral benefit.</p>
<p>Way back when all this stuff was starting,</p>
<p>I remember it would have been in the 80s,</p>
<p>somebody had the idea of using viral</p>
<p>as a metaphor for network effect.</p>
<p>And the whole point was to talk about</p>
<p>how bad network effect was,</p>
<p>that it always created distortions</p>
<p>that ruined the usefulness of economic incentives</p>
<p>that created dangerous distortions.</p>
<p>Like, but then somehow, even after the pandemic,</p>
<p>we think of viral as this good thing</p>
<p>because we imagine ourselves as the virus, right?</p>
<p>We wanna be on the beneficiary side of it.</p>
<p>But of course, you&rsquo;re not likely to be.</p>
<p>There is a sense because money is involved,</p>
<p>people are not reasoning clearly always</p>
<p>because they want to be part of that first viral wave</p>
<p>that makes them rich.</p>
<p>And that blinds people from their basic morality.</p>
<p>I had an interesting conversation.</p>
<p>I sort of feel like I should respect some people&rsquo;s privacy,</p>
<p>but some of the initial people who started Bitcoin,</p>
<p>I remember having an argument about like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s intrinsically a Ponzi scheme,</p>
<p>like the early people have more than the later people.</p>
<p>And the further down the chain you get,</p>
<p>the more you&rsquo;re subject to gambling like dynamics</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s more and more random</p>
<p>and more and more subject to weird network effects</p>
<p>and whatnot unless you&rsquo;re a very small player perhaps</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just buying something,</p>
<p>but even then you&rsquo;ll be subject to fluctuations</p>
<p>because the whole thing is just kind of,</p>
<p>as it fluctuates,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna wave around the little people more.</p>
<p>And I remember the conversation turned to gambling</p>
<p>because gambling is a pretty large economic sector.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always struck me as being nonproductive.</p>
<p>Like somebody goes to Las Vegas and they lose money.</p>
<p>And so one argument is, well, they got entertainment.</p>
<p>They paid for entertainment as they lost money.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>And Las Vegas does up the losing of money</p>
<p>in an entertaining way.</p>
<p>So why not?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like going to a show.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one argument.</p>
<p>The argument that was made to me was different from that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that, no, what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re getting a chance to experience hope.</p>
<p>And a lot of people don&rsquo;t get that chance.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s really worth it.</p>
<p>Even if they&rsquo;re gonna lose,</p>
<p>they have that moment of hope</p>
<p>and they need to be able to experience that.</p>
<p>And it was a very interesting argument.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so heartbreaking, but I&rsquo;ve seen that.</p>
<p>I have that a little bit of a sense.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to some young people</p>
<p>who invest in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>And what I see is this hope.</p>
<p>This is the first thing that gave them hope.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s so heartbreaking to me</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve gotten hope from that.</p>
<p>So much is invested.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like hope from somehow becoming rich</p>
<p>as opposed to something to me.</p>
<p>I apologize, but money is in the longterm</p>
<p>not going to be a source of that deep meaning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to have enough money,</p>
<p>but it should not be the source of hope.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s heartbreaking to me</p>
<p>how many people is the source of hope.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;ve just described the psychology of virality</p>
<p>or the psychology of trying to base a civilization</p>
<p>on semi random occurrences of network effect peaks.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it doesn&rsquo;t really work.</p>
<p>I mean, I think we need to get away from that.</p>
<p>We need to soften those peaks</p>
<p>and accept Microsoft, which deserves every penny,</p>
<p>but in every other case.</p>
<p>Well, you mentioned GitHub.</p>
<p>I think what Microsoft did with GitHub was brilliant.</p>
<p>I was very happy.</p>
<p>Okay, if I can give a, not a critical,</p>
<p>but on Microsoft because they recently purchased Bethesda.</p>
<p>So Elder Scrolls is in their hands.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m watching you, Microsoft,</p>
<p>do not screw up my favorite game.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, look, I&rsquo;m not speaking for Microsoft.</p>
<p>I have an explicit arrangement with them</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t speak for them, obviously,</p>
<p>like that should be very clear.</p>
<p>I do not speak for them.</p>
<p>I am not saying I like them.</p>
<p>I think such is amazing.</p>
<p>The term data dignity was coined by Sacha.</p>
<p>Like, so, you know, we have, it&rsquo;s kind of extraordinary,</p>
<p>but, you know, Microsoft&rsquo;s this giant thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to screw up this or that.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a few occasions in my life</p>
<p>to see how things work from the inside of some big thing.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s always just people kind of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s always like coordination problems.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always human problems.</p>
<p>Oh God, there&rsquo;s some good people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some bad people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always, I hope Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t screw up your game.</p>
<p>And I hope they bring Clippy back.</p>
<p>You should never kill Clippy.</p>
<p>Bring Clippy back.</p>
<p>Oh, Clippy.</p>
<p>But Clippy promotes the myth of AI.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s why, this is why I think you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>How about if we, all right.</p>
<p>Could we bring back Bob instead of Clippy?</p>
<p>Which one was Bob?</p>
<p>Oh, Bob was another thing.</p>
<p>Bob was this other screen character</p>
<p>who was supposed to be the voice of AI.</p>
<p>Cortana?</p>
<p>Would Cortana do it for you?</p>
<p>Cortana is too corporate.</p>
<p>I like it, Cortana&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a woman in Seattle who&rsquo;s like the model for Cortana,</p>
<p>did Cortana&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>The voice?</p>
<p>There was like,</p>
<p>No, the voice is great.</p>
<p>We had her as a, she used to walk around</p>
<p>if you were wearing Hollands for a bit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s happening anymore.</p>
<p>I think, I don&rsquo;t think you should turn a software</p>
<p>into a creature.</p>
<p>Well, you and I,</p>
<p>Get a cat, just get a cat.</p>
<p>You and I, you and I.</p>
<p>Well, get a dog.</p>
<p>Get a dog.</p>
<p>Or a dog, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or a hedgehog.</p>
<p>A hedgehog.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You coauthored a paper, you mentioned Lee Smolin,</p>
<p>titled The Autodidactic Universe,</p>
<p>which describes our universe as one that learns its own physical laws.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a trippy and beautiful and powerful idea.</p>
<p>What are, what would you say are the key ideas in this paper?</p>
<p>Ah, okay.</p>
<p>Well, I should say that paper reflected work from last year</p>
<p>and the project, the program has moved quite a lot.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little, there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff that&rsquo;s not published</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m quite excited about.</p>
<p>So I have to kind of keep my frame in that,</p>
<p>in that last year&rsquo;s thing.</p>
<p>So I have to try to be a little careful about that.</p>
<p>We can think about it in a few different ways.</p>
<p>The core of the paper, the technical core of it</p>
<p>is a triple correspondence.</p>
<p>One part of it was already established</p>
<p>and then another part is in the process.</p>
<p>The part that was established was, of course,</p>
<p>understanding different theories of physics as matrix models.</p>
<p>The part that was fresher is understanding those</p>
<p>as machine learning systems so that we could move fluidly</p>
<p>between these different ways of describing systems.</p>
<p>And the reason to want to do that is to just have more tools</p>
<p>and more options because, well,</p>
<p>theoretical physics is really hard</p>
<p>and a lot of programs have kind of run into a state</p>
<p>where they feel a little stalled, I guess.</p>
<p>I want to be delicate about this</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not a physicist,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the computer scientist collaborating.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t mean to diss anybody&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So this is almost like gives a framework</p>
<p>for generating new ideas in physics.</p>
<p>As we start to publish more about where it&rsquo;s gone,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll start to see there&rsquo;s tools</p>
<p>and ways of thinking about theories</p>
<p>that I think open up some new paths</p>
<p>that will be of interest.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the technical core of it,</p>
<p>which is this idea of a correspondence</p>
<p>to give you more facility.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s also the storytelling part of it.</p>
<p>And this is something Lee loves stories and I do.</p>
<p>And the idea here is that a typical way</p>
<p>of thinking about physics is that there&rsquo;s some kind</p>
<p>of starting condition and then there&rsquo;s some principle</p>
<p>by which the starting condition evolves.</p>
<p>And the question is like, why the starting condition?</p>
<p>The starting condition has to be fine tuned</p>
<p>and all these things about it have to be kind of perfect.</p>
<p>And so we were thinking, well, look,</p>
<p>what if we could push the storytelling</p>
<p>about where the universe comes from much further back</p>
<p>by starting with really simple things that evolve</p>
<p>and then through that evolution,</p>
<p>explain how things got to be how they are</p>
<p>through very simple principles, right?</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve been exploring a variety of ways</p>
<p>to push the start of the storytelling</p>
<p>further and further back,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really kind of interesting</p>
<p>because like for all of his,</p>
<p>Lee is sometimes considered to be,</p>
<p>to have a radical quality in the physics world.</p>
<p>But he still is like, no, this is gonna be like,</p>
<p>the kind of time we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>in which evolution happens is the same time we&rsquo;re now</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re talking about something that starts and continues.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, well, what if there&rsquo;s some other kind</p>
<p>of time that&rsquo;s time like, and it sounds like metaphysics,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s an ambiguity, you know, like,</p>
<p>it has to start from something</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this, a lot of the math</p>
<p>can be thought of either way, which is kind of interesting.</p>
<p>So push this so far back that basically</p>
<p>all the things that we take for granted in physics</p>
<p>start becoming emergent, it&rsquo;s emergent.</p>
<p>I really wanna emphasize this is all super baby steps.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna over claim.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I think a lot of the things we&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re approaching some old problems</p>
<p>in a pretty fresh way, informed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a zillion papers about how you can think</p>
<p>of the universe as a big neural net</p>
<p>or how you can think of different ideas in physics</p>
<p>as being quite similar to, or even equivalent</p>
<p>to some of the ideas in machine learning.</p>
<p>And that actually works out crazy well.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, that is actually kind of eerie</p>
<p>when you look at it, like there&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>two or three dozen papers that have this quality</p>
<p>and some of them are just crazy good.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re trying to do is take those kinds</p>
<p>of observations and turn them into an actionable framework</p>
<p>where you can then start to do things</p>
<p>with landscapes or theories that you couldn&rsquo;t do before</p>
<p>and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>So in that context, or maybe beyond,</p>
<p>how do you explain us humans?</p>
<p>How unlikely are we, this intelligent civilization</p>
<p>or is there a lot of others or are we alone in this universe?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You seem to appreciate humans very much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve grown fond of us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re okay.</p>
<p>We have our nice qualities.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re kind of weird.</p>
<p>We sprout this hair on our heads and then we&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, we&rsquo;re sort of weird animals.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the feature, not a bug, I think.</p>
<p>The weirdness.</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>I think if I&rsquo;m just going to answer you in terms of truth,</p>
<p>the first thing I&rsquo;d say is we&rsquo;re not in a privileged enough</p>
<p>position, at least as yet, to really know much about who we</p>
<p>are, how we are, what we&rsquo;re really like in the context</p>
<p>of something larger, what that context is,</p>
<p>like all that stuff.</p>
<p>We might learn more in the future.</p>
<p>Our descendants might learn more, but we don&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>very much, which you can either view as frustrating or charming</p>
<p>like that first year of TikTok or something.</p>
<p>All roads lead back to TikTok.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Well, lately.</p>
<p>But in terms of, there&rsquo;s another level at which I can think</p>
<p>about it where I sometimes think that if you are just quiet</p>
<p>and you do something that gets you in touch with the way</p>
<p>reality happens, and for me it&rsquo;s playing music, sometimes it</p>
<p>seems like you can feel a bit of how the universe is.</p>
<p>And it feels like there&rsquo;s a lot more going on in it and there</p>
<p>is a lot more life and a lot more stuff happening and a lot</p>
<p>more stuff flowing through it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not speaking as a scientist now.</p>
<p>This is kind of a more my artist side talking and I feel like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m suddenly in multiple personalities with you.</p>
<p>Jack Kerouac said that music is the only truth.</p>
<p>It sounds like you might be at least in part.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a passage in Kerouac&rsquo;s book, Dr.</p>
<p>Sacks, where somebody tries to just explain the whole</p>
<p>situation with reality and people in like a paragraph.</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t reproduce it for you here, but it&rsquo;s like, yeah,</p>
<p>like there are these bulbous things that walk around and</p>
<p>they make these sounds, you can sort of understand them, but</p>
<p>only kind of, and then there&rsquo;s like this, and it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>this amazing, like just really quick, like if some spirit</p>
<p>being or something was going to show up in our reality and</p>
<p>hadn&rsquo;t knew nothing about it, it&rsquo;s like a little basic intro</p>
<p>of like, okay, here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible passage.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a one or two sentence summary in H.</p>
<p>Hiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy, right?</p>
<p>Of what this&hellip;</p>
<p>Mostly harmless.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s truth to that, that music somehow</p>
<p>connects to something that words cannot?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Music is something that just towers above me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like I have an overview of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the reverse.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fully understand it because on one level it&rsquo;s simple.</p>
<p>Like you can say, oh, it&rsquo;s a thing people evolved to</p>
<p>coordinate our brains on a pattern level or something like that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these things you can say about music, which are,</p>
<p>you know, some of that&rsquo;s probably true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also, there&rsquo;s kind of like this, this is the mystery of</p>
<p>meaning.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a way that just instead of just being pure</p>
<p>abstraction, music can have like this kind of substantiality</p>
<p>to it that is philosophically impossible.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to do with it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The amount of understanding I feel I have when I hear the</p>
<p>right song at the right time is not comparable to anything I</p>
<p>can read on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Anything I can understand, read through in language.</p>
<p>The music does connect us to something.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this thing there.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s some kind of a thing in it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve never ever, I&rsquo;ve read across a lot of explanations</p>
<p>from all kinds of interesting people like that it&rsquo;s some kind</p>
<p>of a flow language between people or between people and how</p>
<p>they perceive and that kind of thing.</p>
<p>And that sort of explanation is fine, but it&rsquo;s not quite it</p>
<p>either.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about music that makes me believe that</p>
<p>panpsychism could possibly be true, which is that everything</p>
<p>in the universe is conscious.</p>
<p>It makes me think, makes me be humble in how much or how</p>
<p>little I understand about the functions of our universe that</p>
<p>everything might be conscious.</p>
<p>Most people interested in theoretical physics eventually</p>
<p>land in panpsychism, but I&rsquo;m not one of them.</p>
<p>I still think there&rsquo;s this pragmatic imperative to treat</p>
<p>people as special.</p>
<p>So I will proudly be a dualist without people and cats.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not quite sure where to draw the line or why the</p>
<p>line&rsquo;s there or anything like that.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think I should be required to all the same</p>
<p>questions are equally mysterious for no line.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t feel disadvantaged by that.</p>
<p>So I shall remain a dualist.</p>
<p>But if you listen to anyone trying to explain where</p>
<p>consciousness is in a dualistic sense, either believing in</p>
<p>souls or some special thing in the brain or something, you</p>
<p>pretty much say, screw this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be a panpsychist.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>Well put.</p>
<p>Is there moments in your life that happened that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>defining in the way that you hope others your daughter?</p>
<p>Well, listen, I got to say the moments that defined me were</p>
<p>not the good ones.</p>
<p>The moments that defined me were often horrible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had successes, you know, but if you ask what defined</p>
<p>me, my mother&rsquo;s death, being under the World Trade Center</p>
<p>and the attack, the things that have had an effect on me</p>
<p>were the most were sort of real world, terrible things,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t wish on young people at all.</p>
<p>And this is the thing that&rsquo;s hard about giving advice to</p>
<p>young people that they have to learn their own lessons.</p>
<p>And lessons don&rsquo;t come easily.</p>
<p>And a world which avoids hard lessons will be a stupid</p>
<p>world, you know, and I don&rsquo;t know what to do with it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little bundle of truth that has a bit of a fatalistic</p>
<p>quality to it, but I don&rsquo;t‚Äîthis is like when I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>that, you know, freedom equals eternal annoyance.</p>
<p>Like, you can&rsquo;t‚Äîlike, there&rsquo;s a degree to which honest</p>
<p>advice is not that pleasant to give.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want young people to have to know about</p>
<p>everything.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to wish hardship on them.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think they deserve to have a little grace period</p>
<p>of naivet√© that&rsquo;s pleasant.</p>
<p>I mean, I do, you know, if it&rsquo;s possible, if it&rsquo;s‚Äîthese</p>
<p>things are‚Äîthis is like‚Äîthis is tricky stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, if you‚Äîokay, so let me try a little bit on this</p>
<p>advice thing.</p>
<p>I think one thing‚Äîand any serious, broad advice will</p>
<p>have been given a thousand times before for a thousand</p>
<p>years, so I&rsquo;m not going to claim originality, but I think</p>
<p>trying to find a way to really pay attention to what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>feeling fundamentally, what your sense of the world is, what</p>
<p>your intuition is, if you feel like an intuitive person, what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re‚Äîlike, to try to escape the constant sway of social</p>
<p>perception or manipulation, whatever you wish‚Äînot to</p>
<p>escape it entirely, that would be horrible, but to find cover</p>
<p>from it once in a while, to find a sense of being anchored</p>
<p>in that, to believe in experience as a real thing.</p>
<p>Believing in experience as a real thing is very dualistic.</p>
<p>That goes with my philosophy of dualism.</p>
<p>I believe there&rsquo;s something magical, and instead of squirting</p>
<p>the magic dust on the programs, I think experience is something</p>
<p>real and something apart, something mystical and something‚Äî</p>
<p>Your own personal experience that you just have, and then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying silence the rest of the world enough to hear</p>
<p>that‚Äîlike, whatever that magic dust is in that experience.</p>
<p>Find what is there, and I think that&rsquo;s one thing.</p>
<p>Another thing is to recognize that kindness requires genius,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s actually really hard, that facile kindness is not</p>
<p>kindness, and that it&rsquo;ll take you a while to have the skills</p>
<p>to have kind impulses to want to be kind you can have right</p>
<p>away. To be effectively kind is hard.</p>
<p>To be effectively kind, yeah.</p>
<p>It takes skill. It takes hard lessons.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll never be perfect at it. To the degree you get anywhere</p>
<p>with it, it&rsquo;s the most rewarding thing ever.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, what else would I say?</p>
<p>I would say when you&rsquo;re young, you can be very overwhelmed</p>
<p>by social and interpersonal emotions. You&rsquo;ll have broken hearts and</p>
<p>jealousies. You&rsquo;ll feel socially down the ladder instead of up the</p>
<p>ladder. It feels horrible when that happens. All of these things.</p>
<p>And you have to remember what a fragile crust all that stuff is,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard because right when it&rsquo;s happening, it&rsquo;s just so intense.</p>
<p>If I was actually giving this advice to my daughter, she&rsquo;d already</p>
<p>be out of the room. This is for some hypothetical teenager that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really exist that really wants to sit and listen to my</p>
<p>voice for your daughter 10 years from now. Maybe.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a difficult question?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>You talked about losing your mom.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you miss her?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I still connected her through music. She was a</p>
<p>a young prodigy piano player in Vienna, and she survived the</p>
<p>concentration camp and then died in a car accident here in the US.</p>
<p>What music makes you think of her? Is there a song that connects?</p>
<p>Well, she was in Vienna, so she had the whole Viennese music thing</p>
<p>going, which is this incredible school of absolute skill and</p>
<p>romance bundled together and wonderful on the piano, especially.</p>
<p>I learned to play some of the Beethoven sonatas for her, and I</p>
<p>played them in this exaggerated, drippy way I remember when I was</p>
<p>a kid.</p>
<p>Exaggerated meaning too full of emotion?</p>
<p>Yeah, just like&hellip;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that the only way to play Beethoven? I mean, I didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s any other way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a reasonable question. I mean, the fashion these days is to</p>
<p>be slightly Apollonian even with Beethoven, but one imagines that</p>
<p>actual Beethoven playing might have been different. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know. I&rsquo;ve gotten to play a few instruments he played and tried</p>
<p>to see if I could feel anything about how it might have been for</p>
<p>him. I don&rsquo;t know, really.</p>
<p>I was always against the clinical precision of classical music.</p>
<p>I thought a great piano player should be, like, in pain, like,</p>
<p>you know, emotionally, like, truly feel the music and make it</p>
<p>messy, sort of maybe play classical music the way, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know, blues pianist plays blues.</p>
<p>It seems like they actually got happier, and I&rsquo;m not sure if</p>
<p>Beethoven got happier. I think it&rsquo;s a different kind of concept</p>
<p>of the place of music. I think the blues, the whole African</p>
<p>American tradition was initially surviving awful, awful</p>
<p>circumstances. So you could say, you know, there was some of</p>
<p>that in the concentration camps and all that too. And it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>that Beethoven&rsquo;s circumstances were brilliant, but he kind of</p>
<p>also, I don&rsquo;t know, this is hard. Like, I mean, it would</p>
<p>seem to be his misery was somewhat self imposed, maybe</p>
<p>through, I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s kind of interesting, like, I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>known some people who loathed Beethoven, like the composer,</p>
<p>late composer, Pauline Oliveros, this wonderful modernist</p>
<p>composer. I played in her band for a while, and she was like,</p>
<p>oh, Beethoven, like, that&rsquo;s the worst music ever. It&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>all ego. It completely, it turns information, I mean, it</p>
<p>turns emotion into your enemy. And it&rsquo;s ultimately all about</p>
<p>your own self importance, which has to be at the expense of</p>
<p>others. What else could it be? And blah, blah, blah. So she</p>
<p>had, I shouldn&rsquo;t say, I don&rsquo;t mean to be dismissive, but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just saying, like, her position on Beethoven was very negative</p>
<p>and very unimpressed, which is really interesting because</p>
<p>the manner of the music. I think, I don&rsquo;t know. I mean,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s not here to speak for herself. So it&rsquo;s a little hard</p>
<p>for me to answer that question. But it was interesting because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d always thought of Beethoven as like, whoa, you know, this</p>
<p>is like Beethoven is like really the dude, you know, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just like, Beethoven, Schmadovan, you know, it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>not really happening. Yeah, I still, even though it&rsquo;s cliche,</p>
<p>I like playing personally, just for myself, Moonlight Sonata.</p>
<p>I mean, I just, Moonlight&rsquo;s amazing. I mean, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>Moonlight&rsquo;s amazing. You know, I, you know, you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about comparing the blues and that sensibility from Europe</p>
<p>is so different in so many ways. One of the musicians I</p>
<p>play with is John Batiste, who has the band on Colbert Show,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;ll sit there playing jazz and suddenly go into</p>
<p>Moonlight. He loves Moonlight. And what&rsquo;s kind of interesting</p>
<p>is he&rsquo;s found a way to do Beethoven. And he, by the way,</p>
<p>he can really do Beethoven. Like, he went through Juilliard</p>
<p>and one time he was at my house, he&rsquo;s saying, hey, do you</p>
<p>have the book of Beethoven&rsquo;s Sonatas? I say, yeah, I want to</p>
<p>find one I haven&rsquo;t played. And then he sight read through the</p>
<p>whole damn thing perfectly. And I&rsquo;m like, oh, God, I just</p>
<p>get out of here. I can&rsquo;t even deal with this. But anyway,</p>
<p>but anyway, the thing is he has this way of with the same</p>
<p>persona and the same philosophy moving from the blues into</p>
<p>Beethoven that&rsquo;s really, really fascinating to me. It&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say he plays it as if it were jazz, but he</p>
<p>kind of does. It&rsquo;s kind of really, and he talks, well, he</p>
<p>was sight reading, he talks like Beethoven&rsquo;s talking to him.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s like, oh yeah, here, he&rsquo;s doing this. I can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>John, but you know, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s really interesting. Like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very different. Like for me, I was introduced to</p>
<p>Beethoven as like almost like this godlike figure, and I</p>
<p>presume Pauline was too, that was really kind of a press</p>
<p>for an art to deal with. And for him, it&rsquo;s just like the</p>
<p>conversation. He&rsquo;s playing James P. Johnson or something. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like another musician who did something and they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very cool to be around. It&rsquo;s very kind of freeing</p>
<p>to see someone have that relationship. I would love to</p>
<p>hear him play Beethoven. That sounds amazing. He&rsquo;s great. We</p>
<p>talked about Ernest Becker and how much value he puts on our</p>
<p>mortality and our denial of our mortality. Do you think about</p>
<p>your mortality? Do you think about your own death? You know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s funny is I used to not be able to, but as you get older,</p>
<p>you just know people who die and there&rsquo;s all these things</p>
<p>that just becomes familiar and and more of a more ordinary,</p>
<p>which is what it is. But are you afraid? Sure, although less</p>
<p>so. And it&rsquo;s not like I didn&rsquo;t have some kind of insight or</p>
<p>revelation to become less afraid. I think I just, like I</p>
<p>say, it&rsquo;s kind of familiarity. It&rsquo;s just knowing people who&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>died and I really believe in the future. I have this optimism</p>
<p>that people or this whole thing of life on Earth, this whole</p>
<p>thing we&rsquo;re part of, I don&rsquo;t know where to draw that circle,</p>
<p>but this thing is going somewhere and has some kind of</p>
<p>value and you can&rsquo;t both believe in the future and want</p>
<p>to live forever. You have to make room for it. You know, like</p>
<p>you have to, that optimism has to also come with its own like</p>
<p>humility. You have to make yourself small to believe in</p>
<p>the future and so it actually in a funny way comforts me.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s powerful. And optimism requires you to kind</p>
<p>of step down after a time. Yeah, I mean, that said, life</p>
<p>seems kind of short, but you know, whatever. Do you think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve tried to find I can&rsquo;t find the complaint</p>
<p>department. You know, I really want to I want to bring this</p>
<p>up, but the customer service number never answers and like</p>
<p>the email bounces one way. So yeah, do you think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>meaning to it to life? We&rsquo;ll see. Meaning is a funny word</p>
<p>like we say all these things as if we know what they mean, but</p>
<p>meaning we don&rsquo;t know what we mean when we say meaning like</p>
<p>we obviously do not and it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a funny little</p>
<p>mystical thing. I think it ultimately connects to that</p>
<p>sense of experience that dualists tend to believe in.</p>
<p>I guess there are why like if you look up to the stars and</p>
<p>you experience that awe inspiring like joy at whatever</p>
<p>when you look up to the stars that I don&rsquo;t know why for me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of makes me feel joyful, maybe a little bit</p>
<p>melancholy, just some weird soup of feelings and ultimately</p>
<p>the question is like why are we here in this vast universe?</p>
<p>That question why?</p>
<p>Have you been able in some way maybe through music answer it</p>
<p>for yourself?</p>
<p>My impulse is to feel like it&rsquo;s not quite the right question</p>
<p>to ask, but I feel like going down that path is just too</p>
<p>tedious for the moment and I don&rsquo;t want to do it, but</p>
<p>the wrong question. Well, just because you know, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what meaning is and I think I do know that sense of awe. I</p>
<p>grew up in southern New Mexico and the stars were so vivid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had some weird misfortunes, but I&rsquo;ve had some</p>
<p>weird luck also. One of our near neighbors was the head of</p>
<p>optics research at White Sands and when he was young he</p>
<p>discovered Pluto. His name was Clyde Tombaugh and he taught me</p>
<p>how to make telescopes, grinding mirrors and stuff. My dad</p>
<p>had also made telescopes when he was a kid, but Clyde had like</p>
<p>backyard telescopes that would put to shame a lot of like</p>
<p>I mean he really he did his telescopes you know and so</p>
<p>I remember he&rsquo;d let me go and play with him and just like looking at a</p>
<p>globular cluster and you&rsquo;re seeing the actual photons and with a good</p>
<p>telescope it&rsquo;s really like this object like you can really tell</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t coming through some intervening information structure this</p>
<p>is like the actual photons and it&rsquo;s really a three dimensional object</p>
<p>and you have even a feeling for the vastness of it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s I don&rsquo;t know I so I definitely I was</p>
<p>very very fortunate to have a connection to the sky that way</p>
<p>when I was a kid. To have had that experience</p>
<p>again the emphasis on experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of funny like I feel like sometimes</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve taken when she was younger I took my daughter and her friends to</p>
<p>to like a telescope there are a few around here that are</p>
<p>kids can go and use and they would like look at Jupiter&rsquo;s moons or something</p>
<p>I think like Galilean moons and I don&rsquo;t know if they quite</p>
<p>had that because it&rsquo;s like too</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been just too normalized and I think maybe</p>
<p>when I was growing up screens weren&rsquo;t that common yet and maybe it&rsquo;s like too</p>
<p>confusable with the screen I don&rsquo;t know you know somebody uh</p>
<p>brought up in conversation to me somewhere I don&rsquo;t remember who</p>
<p>but they they kind of posited this idea that</p>
<p>if humans early humans weren&rsquo;t able to see the stars like if</p>
<p>earth atmosphere was such there was cloudy</p>
<p>that we would not develop human civilization there&rsquo;s something about</p>
<p>being able to look up and see a vast universe is like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fundamental to the development of human civilization</p>
<p>I thought that was a curious kind of thought that reminds me of that</p>
<p>old Isaac Asimov story where the you know there&rsquo;s this planet where they</p>
<p>finally get to see what&rsquo;s in the sky once in a while and it turns out they&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>the middle of a globular cluster and they&rsquo;re all these stars and</p>
<p>I forget what happens exactly god that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s from when I was the same age as a</p>
<p>kid I don&rsquo;t really remember yeah uh but um yeah I don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it might be right I&rsquo;m just thinking of all the</p>
<p>civilizations that grew up under clouds I mean like</p>
<p>the the vikings needed a special uh diffracting piece of mica to navigate</p>
<p>because they could never see the sun they had this thing called a sunstone</p>
<p>that they found from this this one cave you know about that</p>
<p>so they were in this like uh they were trying to navigate</p>
<p>boats you know in the north atlantic with without being able to see the sun</p>
<p>because it was cloudy and so they they used uh of a uh</p>
<p>a chunk of mica to diffract it in order to be able to align where the sun really</p>
<p>was because they couldn&rsquo;t tell by eye and navigate so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying there are a lot of civilizations that are pretty impressive</p>
<p>that had to deal with a lot of clouds uh</p>
<p>the amazonians invented our agriculture and they they were probably under</p>
<p>clouds a lot I don&rsquo;t know I don&rsquo;t know to me personally the the question of the</p>
<p>meaning of life becomes most um</p>
<p>vibrant most apparent when you look up at the stars</p>
<p>because it makes me feel very small uh that we&rsquo;re not small</p>
<p>but then you ask it it still feels that we&rsquo;re special and then the natural</p>
<p>question is like well if we are special as I think we</p>
<p>are why the heck are we here in this vast</p>
<p>universe that ultimately is the question of um</p>
<p>right well the meaning of life I mean look</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a confusion sometimes in trying to use uh</p>
<p>to set up a question or a thought experiment or something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s defined in terms of a context to explain something</p>
<p>where there is no larger context and that&rsquo;s a category error</p>
<p>um if we want to do it in physics um or well or in computer science um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to talk about the universe as a Turing machine because a Turing</p>
<p>machine has an external clock and an observer and a</p>
<p>input and output there&rsquo;s a larger context implied in order for it to be</p>
<p>defined at all and so if you&rsquo;re talking about the</p>
<p>universe you can&rsquo;t talk about it coherently as a Turing machine uh</p>
<p>quantum mechanics is like that quantum mechanics has an external clock and has</p>
<p>some kind of external context depending on your interpretation</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s either you know the observer or whatever</p>
<p>uh and there&rsquo;s a they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re similar that way so maybe</p>
<p>maybe Turing machines and quantum mechanics can be</p>
<p>better friends or something because they have a similar setup but the thing is if</p>
<p>you have something that&rsquo;s defined in terms of an outer context you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>talk about ultimates with it because obviously it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not suited for that so there&rsquo;s some ideas that</p>
<p>are their own context general relativity is its own context</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s different that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s hard to unify and</p>
<p>um i think the same thing is true when we talk about</p>
<p>these types of questions like uh meaning is in a context and</p>
<p>to talk about ultimate meaning is therefore a category error it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a um it&rsquo;s not a resolvable way of thinking</p>
<p>it might be a way of thinking that is experientially</p>
<p>um or aesthetically valuable because it is awesome in the sense of</p>
<p>you know awe inspiring um but to try to treat it analytically is not</p>
<p>sensible maybe that&rsquo;s what music can poetry for</p>
<p>yeah maybe i think so i think music actually does</p>
<p>escape any particular context that&rsquo;s how it feels to me but i&rsquo;m not sure about</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s once again crazy artist talking not scientist</p>
<p>well you did uh you do both masterfully uh jaron i&rsquo;m like i said i&rsquo;m a big fan</p>
<p>of everything you&rsquo;ve done of you as a human being</p>
<p>um i appreciate the the fun argument we had today that will i&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>continue for 30 years as it did with mark mitski um honestly</p>
<p>i i deeply appreciate that you spend your really valuable time with me today</p>
<p>it was a really great conversation thank you so much</p>
<p>thanks for listening to this conversation with jaron lanier</p>
<p>to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description</p>
<p>and now let me leave you with some words from jaron lanier himself</p>
<p>a real friendship ought to introduce each person</p>
<p>to unexpected weirdness in the other thank you for listening i hope to see</p>
<p>you next time</p>
