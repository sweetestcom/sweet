    <p>That was good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>My best work pumps.</p>
<p>What have you had it with this week?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with something that I just learned the name of.</p>
<p>I was describing to Kylie, why is my internet Instagram thing?</p>
<p>Every time I open it, it&rsquo;s like these women just eating this weird shit and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>every single time it&rsquo;s just reels and I&rsquo;m always like, what the fuck are they eating</p>
<p>and why are they eating so much?</p>
<p>Blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s called muck bang.</p>
<p>Muck bang.</p>
<p>Muck bang?</p>
<p>Muck bang.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>It means eating weird shit on the internet as far as I know.</p>
<p>But yeah, it&rsquo;s gross.</p>
<p>Do you not ever get that?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this like beautiful girl that&rsquo;s just sitting there that&rsquo;s maybe 80, 90 pounds.</p>
<p>I mean, teensy, teensy.</p>
<p>And it has all this weird shit she&rsquo;s eating.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like one after the other, after the other, like a bite, a bite, a bite.</p>
<p>You know why this is probably happening to you?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re constantly browbeating me about not having snacks in the office.</p>
<p>This whole thing was created to torture you.</p>
<p>Your iPhone hears it, snacking, snacking.</p>
<p>So then it&rsquo;s giving you this algorithm of these, what are they called?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it called?</p>
<p>Muck bang.</p>
<p>M-U-C-K-B-A-N-G.</p>
<p>And I think Kylie says that people like to watch other people eat on the internet, which</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>Like I get people want to watch people have sex, like porn.</p>
<p>That seems okay, normal.</p>
<p>I mean, being the porn addict that you are, I totally understand.</p>
<p>Well, absolutely.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m a porn star.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I totally see how that would be right in your warehouse.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just saying like of all this shit you can watch on the internet, you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to watch somebody eat something weird?</p>
<p>Like when you say something weird, what, are you talking about a cricket or what?</p>
<p>How weird?</p>
<p>One of them was like an alive squid, like ate it while it was alive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>It is weird.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard.</p>
<p>I mean, I haven&rsquo;t seen that and I&rsquo;m probably now going to because my phone&rsquo;s in the recording</p>
<p>studio.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to start coming on.</p>
<p>You just completely dicked me over.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Yet again.</p>
<p>Yet again.</p>
<p>Yet again, you porn star dick over pumps.</p>
<p>Stormy pumps.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what I&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Lay it on me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with stupid advice.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let me, let me tell you one.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll be like at a wedding reception and the mother of the groom or the father of the</p>
<p>bride will be like, I want to give you guys some advice.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Never go to bed angry.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Number one, that is such bullshit.</p>
<p>Unrealistic.</p>
<p>Anybody who says that they&rsquo;ve never gone to bed mad at their significant other is a fucking</p>
<p>liar, a lying liar to the most extreme.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s unbelievable how unrealistic of a goal that is.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And what unrealistic advice it is because sometimes you&rsquo;re angry because you&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>tired.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And you know, it has nothing to do with the other person.</p>
<p>And sometimes you need to sleep on it.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can&rsquo;t resolve an issue in one night.</p>
<p>I would say more often than not, sleeping on it is better in any type of anger situation,</p>
<p>not just marriage.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Although you and I, for sure, in our heyday of having marital problems, would drag out</p>
<p>the spouse.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>For no reason.</p>
<p>Get your, no, for lots of reasons.</p>
<p>I mean, for lots of reasons.</p>
<p>But in the moment it was like we were mad about something that happened four days ago</p>
<p>and it just happened right then.</p>
<p>Get your ass out of bed and let&rsquo;s fucking dissect this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m mad.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh, I thought you meant to the other, to the spouse, like wake up and start browbeating</p>
<p>over something that happened a week earlier.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve done that too.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m talking about in the throes of marital problems.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m talking about rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The marriage is red alert.</p>
<p>It is imploded nuclear bomb style.</p>
<p>Multiple times.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>in the brain about some bullshit that happened and I&rsquo;m like, get your fucking ass up.</p>
<p>I want to chew this up.</p>
<p>I want to talk about it and I want to talk about it right this very second.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I just think that kind of advice for our younger listeners, you&rsquo;re going to go to bed</p>
<p>at times mad at your spouse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just going to happen.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to go to bed mad at you sometimes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just going to happen.</p>
<p>It is, it&rsquo;s human nature.</p>
<p>We get mad, time happens, apologies happen, therapy occurs.</p>
<p>Sometimes people have to go to rehab.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s neither here nor there.</p>
<p>And then, you know, you can resolve things.</p>
<p>I have been to several weddings where they&rsquo;re like, what&rsquo;s your advice for the bride and</p>
<p>groom?</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re asking the guests.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so stupid.</p>
<p>My standard response is you don&rsquo;t want mine.</p>
<p>I have no marital advice to give.</p>
<p>I think that relationships are so unique to the couple.</p>
<p>You know, for example, Jen and Nealey like to sit on the same side of the booth.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s stupid.</p>
<p>You think that&rsquo;s stupid.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had it with that.</p>
<p>But that is something you&rsquo;re super into.</p>
<p>Well I would like to welcome everybody to I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jennifer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Angie.</p>
<p>We call her Pumps.</p>
<p>And today we are going to talk about a very, very interesting subject for all women and</p>
<p>men across this great country of ours.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to exclude the three to four international listeners we have.</p>
<p>So Saudi Arabia, I&rsquo;m talking to you.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re talking about when you&rsquo;re in a relationship and your antennas go up and you know something&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not right.</p>
<p>Maybe your partner or your spouse or your boyfriend or your girlfriend is looking at</p>
<p>their phone a lot, but they&rsquo;re hiding their phone from you.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, that&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s keeping that phone in that pocket 24-7.</p>
<p>He used to have it out.</p>
<p>And then you confront the person, why are you being so weird about your phone?</p>
<p>And then they kind of say, I&rsquo;m not being weird about my phone.</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t you minding your own business?</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, slowly this narrative starts to change, where something that was</p>
<p>all accessible at all times out in the open, you start sensing these secrets.</p>
<p>One could argue that perhaps you&rsquo;re being gaslit a little bit.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We were gaslit before there was a name.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Pumps and I have horrible pickers when it comes to picking life partners.</p>
<p>Horrible.</p>
<p>I want to teach a seminar on how not to pick a husband.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I think we should start a service for parents to hire us with their daughter&rsquo;s fiance.</p>
<p>And if we like that person and give it a go, call off the wedding immediately.</p>
<p>Immediately.</p>
<p>Especially if Pumps likes them.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Or if I say, oh my gosh, absolutely not.</p>
<p>Do not marry.</p>
<p>Marry immediately.</p>
<p>Put a lasso on that motherfucker.</p>
<p>Get him down to the courthouse.</p>
<p>Marry him right then.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Because I am 100% the worst picker.</p>
<p>I probably should have been just taken out of the gene pool at birth.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, I have the three greatest kids in the world, but I&rsquo;m just saying, if you look at</p>
<p>my track record.</p>
<p>Well, I do want to insert this one caveat, listener, and it is that right now, and you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>probably heard the episode with my magnificent husband, Josh.</p>
<p>We are in a great space now and we&rsquo;ve been together 20 years, but we have gone to hell</p>
<p>and back multiple times.</p>
<p>And there have been instincts and instances in our marriage where my antennas were up</p>
<p>and alert.</p>
<p>And I thought something is amiss here.</p>
<p>Something is fucking wrong here.</p>
<p>He is fucking lying to me.</p>
<p>And then I confront him and then I get more lies.</p>
<p>And then what happens is your sanity gets questioned.</p>
<p>You think, am I going crazy?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Or are my instincts correct?</p>
<p>And for those of you that have been in this type of relationship before, and it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily have to be an alcoholic.</p>
<p>It could be a narcissist or, and let&rsquo;s just face it, people are kind of broken and messed</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And a lot of this stuff comes to light when we partner with other people.</p>
<p>And live in the same house.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It, all of these issues kind of come to the surface and they play themselves out.</p>
<p>And I know this because I&rsquo;ve spent an obscene amount of money on therapy.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Can you even imagine if we got a dollar amount on the therapy?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>An embarrassing amount.</p>
<p>We could probably buy Twitter.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>But I think that for those of you out there that find yourselves in a relationship and</p>
<p>you know something&rsquo;s amiss, your antennas are up and you&rsquo;re confronting the person about</p>
<p>it and they are circling back to you and telling you you&rsquo;re crazy.</p>
<p>But I want everyone to know that number one, you&rsquo;re not crazy.</p>
<p>If your antennas consistently keep going up, that instinct in our brain is telling us that</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s not right.</p>
<p>And then if you go to the, your significant other and they&rsquo;re telling you you&rsquo;re crazy,</p>
<p>you genuinely start to feel crazy.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And some people go to great lengths to confirm their reality because their partner or their</p>
<p>significant other isn&rsquo;t giving it to them.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not giving them the truth.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not giving them the facts.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to give you a prime example.</p>
<p>So when Pumps was married, we were suspicious that her husband was up to no good.</p>
<p>So we decided we were going to do a reconnaissance trip.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>He was an attorney.</p>
<p>And we go and scope out the office, right?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re like, okay, so what we can do tomorrow is we can get our babysitter&rsquo;s car and we</p>
<p>can go stake out across the street.</p>
<p>And we look across the street and there is a closed down bank, 100% closed.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 100% closed.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re like, perfect.</p>
<p>We can back in there.</p>
<p>We can see the parking lot.</p>
<p>Great view.</p>
<p>Perfect view.</p>
<p>We, I don&rsquo;t know what we thought we were going to see other than lawyers walking in and out</p>
<p>of a building.</p>
<p>But at the time, it seemed like a rock solid idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rock solid.</p>
<p>And I wonder what did the babysitter think when we were like, we need to take your car.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s neither here nor there.</p>
<p>Totally different story.</p>
<p>So we proceed the next day to put on baseball caps, sunglasses, and we wear black.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t plan that, but we both did.</p>
<p>We get the babysitter&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>We go through the drive-through of Taco Bell, as most people that are conducting a reconnaissance</p>
<p>trip do.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to eat while you&rsquo;re on the lookout.</p>
<p>And we back into the bank that we had confirmed had closed down.</p>
<p>So we had backed in to the bank and we start eating our Mexi-melts, our tacos and our burritos.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Hot sauces flying around the car.</p>
<p>We see a man in a business suit exit the building and then we see a man in a business suit enter</p>
<p>the building.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all we got.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all we got.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re eating and we&rsquo;re like, adrenaline&rsquo;s pumping.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re waiting for the shoe to drop.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, Pumps goes, is this bank open?</p>
<p>I saw the light.</p>
<p>And there was like, out of the corner of my eye, I saw the light, like a green light.</p>
<p>And I was like, the lane is open.</p>
<p>So we turned around and there&rsquo;s a big drive-through bank window.</p>
<p>Huge plate glass window with tellers, four, four tellers sitting there like, what are</p>
<p>they doing?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re backed in.</p>
<p>Our cars aren&rsquo;t going the right way.</p>
<p>Going backed in.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re staring at us.</p>
<p>And we have burritos hanging out of our mouths.</p>
<p>Incognito.</p>
<p>Incognito.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I was like, oh my God.</p>
<p>We leave the bank.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re so fucking dumb.</p>
<p>We then go park in this parking lot that&rsquo;s adjacent to the bank.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like right on the side of the bank.</p>
<p>And then the tellers get to leave for lunch.</p>
<p>Oh, God, I forgot that part.</p>
<p>Listener, bear with me.</p>
<p>I got to get through this.</p>
<p>All the tellers that had just saw these crackheads with burritos back into the bank the wrong</p>
<p>way, they all leave for lunch and then they look across the street and they see us still</p>
<p>eating.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, I&rsquo;d forgotten the tellers spotted us after lunch.</p>
<p>It was so horrifying, like it was so bad, but we didn&rsquo;t give up.</p>
<p>No, we remained steadfast to the reconnaissance trip, right?</p>
<p>We doubled down.</p>
<p>But listener, I share this because I want you to know that when you&rsquo;re being lied to</p>
<p>and somebody questions your reality, you will get your best friend and you will get Taco</p>
<p>Bell and you will get the fucking babysitter&rsquo;s car and you will back into a fucking open</p>
<p>bank with four eyewitnesses.</p>
<p>How crazy you are.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t crack anything big.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But in this episode, we&rsquo;re kind of talking about this, the art of conducting an investigation</p>
<p>on a lying liar, significant other.</p>
<p>Lying liar who lies a lot.</p>
<p>And we have some guests that this is great shit, listener.</p>
<p>These guests are private investigators out of the tri-state area, which is like New York,</p>
<p>New Jersey, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>It is an all-female run PI firm.</p>
<p>And our guest names are Barry Kroll and Jen Rosant.</p>
<p>And they are going to join us because they have seen some shit and I&rsquo;m going to take</p>
<p>a wild crack at it.</p>
<p>I bet they wouldn&rsquo;t have backed into the open bank.</p>
<p>I bet they would not have.</p>
<p>They might be just a touch better than we were at it.</p>
<p>They might be.</p>
<p>They might be.</p>
<p>Hi, guys.</p>
<p>How you doing?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re great.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m Jennifer and this is Angie, but we call her Pumps.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Thanks for being here.</p>
<p>So we were just talking before you guys came on because one thing we were not very good</p>
<p>at doing is picking spouses.</p>
<p>We were both just abject failures.</p>
<p>My husband is, I mean, he was a rough diamond.</p>
<p>I have shined the shit out of that motherfucker.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>But it took a long time to do.</p>
<p>About 20 years.</p>
<p>And so we were just talking about, and I think that a lot of people can relate that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in a relationship and your antennas go up and you&rsquo;re like, something&rsquo;s off.</p>
<p>And then you talk to your spouse or your partner or, you know, boyfriend, girlfriend, and they</p>
<p>start saying, no, you&rsquo;re crazy.</p>
<p>And so your reality is like completely cracked, you know, it&rsquo;s just that has no foundation.</p>
<p>And so you go to these great links to try to confirm that you&rsquo;re not a crazy person</p>
<p>because these antennas just keep going up.</p>
<p>Enter the all-female sensation out of the tri-state area, Jennifer Berry.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And so we conducted our own investigations and we were really bad at it.</p>
<p>Really bad at it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>We were.</p>
<p>We were pretty good on the phone records.</p>
<p>You were.</p>
<p>I was really good.</p>
<p>She really wanted to get her husband&rsquo;s phone records.</p>
<p>And this was in like 2008-ish, maybe?</p>
<p>Early 2008, 2007.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You were still allowed.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It was with his business, like the phone records are with his business.</p>
<p>And so she wasn&rsquo;t able to log in and see the call log.</p>
<p>And I was like, I will get those fucking phone records, Pumps.</p>
<p>She goes, there&rsquo;s no way you&rsquo;re going to be able to.</p>
<p>So we drive to the AT&amp;T store.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;re pulling up, she is so naive.</p>
<p>Her husband&rsquo;s like office manager is pulling out.</p>
<p>She goes, oh my God, look, there&rsquo;s such and such.</p>
<p>And I go, well, he obviously just sent him to get the phone records.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, no.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve been crawling up his ass to get the phone records.</p>
<p>So I go in and she&rsquo;s like a nervous wreck.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, go into the AT&amp;T store and I&rsquo;m like, hey, I work for this guy and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>so mean to me.</p>
<p>And I was supposed to like completely do this expense report and I messed up.</p>
<p>I lost the phone record bill that y&rsquo;all sent and can you please do me a solid and get it</p>
<p>for me?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna lose my job.</p>
<p>Can you please do it?</p>
<p>She printed the whole things.</p>
<p>I walked out and just put them in her lap.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It was unbelievable.</p>
<p>And to this day, he and his company could never get those records because it was an</p>
<p>overnight records.</p>
<p>It was within 24 hours and he never, ever, ever.</p>
<p>They could never get him.</p>
<p>But we got him.</p>
<p>Jennifer got him.</p>
<p>We got him.</p>
<p>So that was my most.</p>
<p>That was your claim to fame.</p>
<p>That was the ninja move.</p>
<p>That was it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That was a really good one.</p>
<p>But what we want to hear from you all is what type of people hire you and is everybody fucking</p>
<p>around on everybody?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll start with that.</p>
<p>No, not everybody&rsquo;s fucking around on everybody.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s people like you, right?</p>
<p>So the antennas are going up.</p>
<p>They still like you explained it.</p>
<p>You explained it perfectly.</p>
<p>The reality is shattered.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re listening to their partner.</p>
<p>The partner says, no, you&rsquo;re crazy.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, am I crazy?</p>
<p>It must be me.</p>
<p>Keeps telling me I&rsquo;m crazy.</p>
<p>I have to be crazy.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And they are crazy.</p>
<p>No offense.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you why.</p>
<p>Because there are people that come to us.</p>
<p>We will give them video of a sexual act of whatever they without listening to their own</p>
<p>spidey sense.</p>
<p>There are little antenna that go up.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll go back to the partner and say, I hired this private show me look this video and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting a blow job in the car and he is he&rsquo;s literally getting a blow job in the car.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>She calls me and she says, you know, Barry, you know, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you did a very good job.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t do a good job.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t do a good job.</p>
<p>And she says, well, I showed Tony the video and he said, you know, your private investigator,</p>
<p>you know, it doesn&rsquo;t show us having intercourse.</p>
<p>Girl, I can&rsquo;t help you.</p>
<p>I cannot help.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>I cannot help you.</p>
<p>So talk about like, you know, reality shattered like.</p>
<p>And the gaslighting.</p>
<p>But I think at some point, you know, at some point a person is, you know, a true victim.</p>
<p>But then after they are exposed to the truth, then they are a willing victim, right?</p>
<p>You know, they are willingly re-victimizing themselves.</p>
<p>Initially, people are victims.</p>
<p>But then when you&rsquo;re presented with the truth and you choose to keep going down that path</p>
<p>and getting abused, it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re being a willful victim.</p>
<p>Well, and I think part of the reason is you don&rsquo;t want to believe it.</p>
<p>Like you will do anything not to believe it, because I do divorce law and we&rsquo;re a no fault</p>
<p>state.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t have to prove extramarital affairs or anything like that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just like they tell you these terrible stories about what their spouse has done to</p>
<p>them and just terrible.</p>
<p>And like I go home and I worry, like, is it going to be OK?</p>
<p>Is she going to be fine or is he going to be fine?</p>
<p>And then the next thing you know, it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re going to reconcile, dah, dah, dah, dah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just like, OK.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t judge it because I&rsquo;ve been that person before that wanted so desperately</p>
<p>not to believe the truth.</p>
<p>But it does become like like you said, like you kind of get what you deserve or not.</p>
<p>No, you become a willful.</p>
<p>Yeah, you become a part of it.</p>
<p>Participant.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just you can&rsquo;t be helped.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be there to help you.</p>
<p>I tell people all the time and I just had this conversation with a male client of mine</p>
<p>who has been my client, young couple since 2017.</p>
<p>He is still, unfortunately, my client because, well, he&rsquo;s a puss because, you know, you have</p>
<p>an affair with somebody who&rsquo;s like at a gym and then, you know, you&rsquo;re the one who had</p>
<p>the affair says, well, I have to go to that gym.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t say, girl, if you go to that gym, we&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re done with the gym.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a million other gyms that you can go to.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re done with this one.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so true.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s what I want to circle back to.</p>
<p>And I know the listener wants to circle back to when it pumps.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re going to want to.</p>
<p>How do you get this footage of the BJ in the car?</p>
<p>I mean, walk me down that path, Jen and Barry.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just let&rsquo;s take us on a reconnaissance trip with you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re following this guy around, supposedly a cheating spouse, following the dinner.</p>
<p>Everything is good.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re having enjoying their dinner and they get into his Jeep and I&rsquo;m following behind</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tailing them all through like one question.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s with the mistress.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Dinner.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s with the mistress.</p>
<p>OK, go on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She left her car at the restaurant.</p>
<p>OK, he got in the car.</p>
<p>She got in the car and we&rsquo;re driving and they pulled into a park and I pulled across the</p>
<p>street because I have to be careful.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get made, but I want to I want to seal the deal like I want to see action.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Yeah, totally.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m driving around and as I&rsquo;m driving around, I turn the lights off on my car and I drive</p>
<p>up next to them and I look and all I see is from the reflection on the street and the</p>
<p>girl had blonde hair and all I see is.</p>
<p>I was like, I can&rsquo;t believe this.</p>
<p>I think that specifically in terms of like getting the goods when someone&rsquo;s having an</p>
<p>affair, unless the partner has spooked them in some way, like the person, my client.</p>
<p>And I always ask them, unless my client has said to that person, I&rsquo;m going to have you</p>
<p>followed.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to get away with this.</p>
<p>I got somebody to watch you, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Most of the time they are in their own world.</p>
<p>I literally pulled up in a parking lot right in daylight.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>They were so into each other, pulled up right next to them, jumped in the back seat and</p>
<p>just filming right through my tinted windows in the back.</p>
<p>They had no clue.</p>
<p>So I think that, you know, when they&rsquo;re in their zone, they are not caring about what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going around them.</p>
<p>So sometimes it&rsquo;s a little easier than you think it might be than it should be.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re all like nervous or like, oh, you know, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re probably on</p>
<p>high alert.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re cheating, doing something wrong.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Unless somebody has kind of tarnished it.</p>
<p>Which they all do.</p>
<p>All the divorce clients, they rat themselves out before they do it.</p>
<p>I am going to go through your phone and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah at five o&rsquo;clock tonight</p>
<p>when you get, and I did it.</p>
<p>I did it.</p>
<p>You were the worst.</p>
<p>I was the worst.</p>
<p>I was the worst.</p>
<p>Let me share a story with you.</p>
<p>She would be a nightmare client.</p>
<p>I, I try, I got the phone records.</p>
<p>I delivered the goods for her, but then she wouldn&rsquo;t fucking listen to me.</p>
<p>Her husband&rsquo;s out to like 5am, 6am.</p>
<p>She calls me the next morning and she&rsquo;s like, he didn&rsquo;t get home to like 6am.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>Whatever he&rsquo;s telling you, he&rsquo;s fucking lying.</p>
<p>So she confronts him and he makes up the story that he&rsquo;s been at IHOP.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>International House of Pancakes with his buddies eating breakfast from 2am until 6am.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s, well, that&rsquo;s what he said he did.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Oh, it gets far worse.</p>
<p>It gets far worse.</p>
<p>I have to say.</p>
<p>And so she said, I&rsquo;m going to go up to IHOP and I&rsquo;m going to talk to the manager and see</p>
<p>if he was there.</p>
<p>And I said, whatever you do, do not tell your husband that you&rsquo;re going to IHOP.</p>
<p>Just while I already did.</p>
<p>And I go, let me tell you exactly what&rsquo;s going to happen when you walk into IHOP.</p>
<p>And she said, what?</p>
<p>And I said, you&rsquo;re going to go up to him and you&rsquo;re going to ask him, was this guy in here?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s going to say, yes, he sat there and this is what he ordered.</p>
<p>And your husband and the manager all going to have the same story because he slipped</p>
<p>him a Benjamin.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s just no fucking doubt about it.</p>
<p>So she calls me, she goes, I&rsquo;m just leaving IHOP.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s exactly what he said.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>He had the scrambled eggs, the bacon and the pancake.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, hello, hello.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this.</p>
<p>Do you guys ever have like a total psycho-like client?</p>
<p>Well, I know they probably all are, but I&rsquo;m talking extreme.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s like, I think my husband has the potential to cheat.</p>
<p>Will you catfish him and see if you can get him?</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t catfish, but we have had people that think that out of their mind, husband&rsquo;s cheating.</p>
<p>Oh, I mean, there&rsquo;s some that I got to tell you, that&rsquo;s more often than not.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>More often they&rsquo;re not cheating or they&rsquo;re not cheating with a person.</p>
<p>I mean, we had somebody not too long ago, like having a love affair with food.</p>
<p>She was convinced he was cheating on her.</p>
<p>She went through phone numbers on his phone, Pennsylvania number.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got to be a woman ran the number.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t come back to anything.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t we couldn&rsquo;t get a hit on it.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re like, oh, maybe, maybe she&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And then the son would be like, dad, every Saturday and Sunday, where are you going?</p>
<p>Now the kid was 20.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like a baby.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that cruel.</p>
<p>So, but it was an adult son saying, dad, mom wants to know where you&rsquo;re going every Saturday</p>
<p>for two hours at a time.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m not telling you guys.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s none of your business.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s like, Gary, he&rsquo;s not telling me anything.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, she&rsquo;s definitely having an affair.</p>
<p>I know who it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this woman, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s from Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>He met her at work.</p>
<p>She had a whole narrative.</p>
<p>The narrative was set.</p>
<p>Jim follows him.</p>
<p>I follow him.</p>
<p>I follow him all day.</p>
<p>Barry&rsquo;s like, where is he going?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, he left.</p>
<p>He left.</p>
<p>First place he goes, he went to shop.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>He comes out with food.</p>
<p>OK, he never brings it home like a small bag sitting in his car and eating the food.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Maybe he just needs a snack before, you know, then he just sits there.</p>
<p>And next thing you know, we&rsquo;re now we&rsquo;re at a Chinese restaurant.</p>
<p>A little while later, he grabs a slice of pizza.</p>
<p>The final straw.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, Barry, he pulled into McDonald&rsquo;s and he got an ice cream and he was eating it.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, Barry, there&rsquo;s something wrong with him.</p>
<p>He just looks really depressed.</p>
<p>He was staring at the ice.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Looking out his window.</p>
<p>You know, he was staring at the ice cream.</p>
<p>So when you tell the wife, like, hey, here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>He is up to no good.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to the Chinese restaurant and to McDonald&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I said to her, does she believe you have snacks?</p>
<p>I swear to God.</p>
<p>I said, you know, he just drove around and I said, do you let him have snacks at home?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, well, you know, we&rsquo;re losing weight and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>And I was like, mm hmm.</p>
<p>And that was the end of her.</p>
<p>If you think your significant other is fucking around from the time they call you to</p>
<p>to the time you&rsquo;ve cracked the case and you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>blowjob footage, how much time has passed?</p>
<p>Depends.</p>
<p>Depends how quick.</p>
<p>My my rule of thumb is I say we do surveillance.</p>
<p>We plan on it for three consecutive days.</p>
<p>OK, unless somebody&rsquo;s out of town or someone else is married and they only have certain</p>
<p>availability going on, I say they will see that person within one to three days.</p>
<p>Sometimes happens the first day, like within hours.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s done right.</p>
<p>I had a case where a woman called me and she said, you know, I had this other detective.</p>
<p>We really didn&rsquo;t get anywhere.</p>
<p>But where we did get was, you know, my husband.</p>
<p>I definitely think he I thought he was having an affair and he would always bring the suitcase</p>
<p>with him.</p>
<p>He would wheel the suitcase to work from work, like whatever.</p>
<p>And she said one day the detective was like, well, why don&rsquo;t you just look in the suitcase?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, no, I don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>I mean, you do it.</p>
<p>So they got she had this guy come into our house in her basement, look in the suitcase</p>
<p>and there was women&rsquo;s clothing in it.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, oh, my God, it&rsquo;s having an affair.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s women&rsquo;s clothing in it.</p>
<p>And it got to the point where I started watching him because she was convinced that because</p>
<p>she started going, finally going through the bag herself.</p>
<p>And she said she would find shoes that were like a size nine, that it was a wig.</p>
<p>I mean, shoes that were like size 11 rather than a wig and clothing.</p>
<p>And then she noticed her purses were missing.</p>
<p>One day she was home and found pearls like a necklace had broken.</p>
<p>There were like pearls in the sink.</p>
<p>So I watch him and she&rsquo;s like, I just need she&rsquo;s like, I want to be done with him.</p>
<p>And it turns this whole blackmail scheme to on top of everything else.</p>
<p>So the guy was like loaded.</p>
<p>He was a very like he was like a very well known professional in the area.</p>
<p>Everybody knew him.</p>
<p>They looked at them.</p>
<p>They were like the king and queen of the town.</p>
<p>And she said, I just want to have this marriage and I want my lifestyle and I got to get pictures</p>
<p>of him.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s dressing like a woman.</p>
<p>And sure enough, I was there one day parked outside the house where she said to me, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to we set it up.</p>
<p>I said, you go somewhere for the day.</p>
<p>And she did.</p>
<p>And sure enough, I&rsquo;m at the house and I said, is your house for sale?</p>
<p>Like you expecting a realtor or something?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, no, I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>He had come outside to show me who he was.</p>
<p>All I saw was a woman with a wig on and tall woman, blue sweater.</p>
<p>I remember to this day what he was wearing.</p>
<p>Blue sweater, black skirt, black tights and heels came outside, looked around.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, he is having an affair.</p>
<p>Like, who&rsquo;s this woman?</p>
<p>So she comes home.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you got to go in the suitcase.</p>
<p>You got to look in the suitcase and you got to see what&rsquo;s in there.</p>
<p>It was the exact outfit and wig that I saw a wig with bangs, a blue sweater.</p>
<p>So he was cross-dressing and he wanted he knew I was there.</p>
<p>He wanted me to see him.</p>
<p>He started to get to the point where he&rsquo;s like exploring.</p>
<p>That was one of the weirdest cases that I had.</p>
<p>That one was pretty bizarre.</p>
<p>And then he ended up like, well, choking her and she stayed with him.</p>
<p>So, you know, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Like, he got so flustered.</p>
<p>She started, like, pressing him and questioning him, like, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>And he just got really frustrated.</p>
<p>And one day he just choked her.</p>
<p>And I remember being in the parking lot of a Walgreens and she calls me at night and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like, I don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>Like, you got to go to the police.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t trust the police.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so well known.</p>
<p>They all know him.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re going to think I&rsquo;m lying.</p>
<p>And they believed her and they arrested him.</p>
<p>And then she took him back.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those things that can&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Just you don&rsquo;t know where to go with that.</p>
<p>So I mean, together, of course, they are.</p>
<p>We thought for a time that my ex-husband might be gay because we were calling.</p>
<p>OK, so once we once we got the phone records, we immediately go back to I think we&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>my house.</p>
<p>And this is like all printed paper.</p>
<p>And we have highlighters, Marlboro lights.</p>
<p>And I mean, we have paperclips, staplers, and we are starting the system just of insanity.</p>
<p>Insanity.</p>
<p>So her husband&rsquo;s an attorney and he&rsquo;s sitting in the conference room and there&rsquo;s like 10</p>
<p>to 15 people at the conference table.</p>
<p>And she just starts calling the numbers one by one.</p>
<p>She hit star six, seven.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll be anonymous.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s in a meeting and this partner&rsquo;s phone rings and it&rsquo;s a hang up.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>And then the person next to him rings and it&rsquo;s a hang up.</p>
<p>And then the next person rings and it&rsquo;s a hang up.</p>
<p>So she prank calls all of them.</p>
<p>And then he calls me and says, quit calling everybody.</p>
<p>And then this one number consistently ends up showing up.</p>
<p>And so we say, oh, here it is again.</p>
<p>Do you have the 243 number?</p>
<p>Got the 243.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, my God, the 243 is again.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, it&rsquo;s the 243.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s like seven calls in one day.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like April 14th.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s his CPA.</p>
<p>So we totally, I mean, we did, I mean, you know, obviously she&rsquo;s divorced now,</p>
<p>but we did, I mean, we did our best to be badasses like you all.</p>
<p>But if you did a great job, I think the prank calling, I mean, that&rsquo;s iffy.</p>
<p>We did back into a bank that was open drive through and were made by the tellers.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about being made.</p>
<p>Yeah, we were made by all tellers.</p>
<p>We thought the bank was closed and they had like a bank.</p>
<p>You were made.</p>
<p>Yeah, we were, we were made a lot.</p>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>And with all of these new like tracking devices.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be so much easier.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You guys are amazing.</p>
<p>I love the all female vibe.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re both gorgeous.</p>
<p>I love everything about it.</p>
<p>I love this so much.</p>
<p>I want you guys to do us a favor and I want you to start thinking about some of your good</p>
<p>cases.</p>
<p>I think this could be a regular situation because this shit is so good because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so relatable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so relatable.</p>
<p>And nobody really, unless our listeners are like super functional.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>That would be, there&rsquo;s no such thing.</p>
<p>If they like us, let&rsquo;s face it.</p>
<p>Thanks for being on.</p>
<p>I appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thank you so, so much.</p>
<p>We hope.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>I think that is just the most enviable job.</p>
<p>But I do think it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>One to three days.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to happen in one to three days.</p>
<p>One to three days.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the limit.</p>
<p>But I mean, you think about it.</p>
<p>I mean, these people are Jones in for it.</p>
<p>One to three days and they crack the case.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be a good job.</p>
<p>Other than all the blowjobs you see.</p>
<p>Random men&rsquo;s dick.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s just not fun to watch.</p>
<p>Take pictures of.</p>
<p>Would you think it&rsquo;d be enjoyable?</p>
<p>I mean, no.</p>
<p>I just think like there&rsquo;s an excitement to is he fucking around?</p>
<p>Is he fucking around?</p>
<p>You go and then boom.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s given him a blowjob.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, that would be the happy ending to being a private detective.</p>
<p>For both of you.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>For both the subject and for the private investigator.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like, yes, I got the goods.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve probably seen a lot of creepy shit.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>No doubt.</p>
<p>No doubt.</p>
<p>Well, listener, thank you so much for joining us.</p>
<p>I think that was such a fantastic episode.</p>
<p>Please voice memo to at I&rsquo;ve had it on Instagram and tell us if you yourself</p>
<p>have fallen prey to a cheating spouse and what you have had it with.</p>
<p>So we can follow up with a bonus episode on this.</p>

<p>I think they&rsquo;re already listening.</p>
