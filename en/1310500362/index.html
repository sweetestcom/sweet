    <p>The following is a conversation with Ayla,</p>
<p>a sex researcher who does some of the largest</p>
<p>human sexuality survey studies in the world</p>
<p>on everything from fetishes to relationships.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s fearless in pursuing her curiosity on these topics</p>
<p>by asking challenging and fascinating questions</p>
<p>and looking for answers in a rigorous data-driven way</p>
<p>and writing about it on her blog, knowingless.com.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s also a sex worker,</p>
<p>including OnlyFans and Escorting,</p>
<p>and is an exceptionally prolific creator</p>
<p>of thought-provoking Twitter polls.</p>
<p>Ayla and I disagree on a bunch of things,</p>
<p>but that just made this conversation even more interesting.</p>
<p>I like interesting people in the full range</p>
<p>of the meaning that the word interesting implies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently reading On the Road by Jack Kerouac</p>
<p>and would be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t mention</p>
<p>one of my favorite quotes from that book</p>
<p>that feels relevant here.</p>
<p>The only people for me are the mad ones,</p>
<p>the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk,</p>
<p>mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time,</p>
<p>the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing,</p>
<p>but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow Roman candles</p>
<p>exploding like spiders across the stars.</p>
<p>In the middle, you see the blue center light pop</p>
<p>and everybody goes, ah.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got House of Macadamias for healthy midday snacks.</p>
<p>Why midday snacks?</p>
<p>Snacks anytime.</p>
<p>A Side of Greens for a delicious daily multivitamin</p>
<p>and Inside Tracker for bio-monitoring.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>Also, if you want to work with our amazing team,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re always hiring.</p>
<p>Go to lexfriedman.com slash hiring.</p>
<p>And now, onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make this interesting, but if you skip them,</p>
<p>please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will, too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by</p>
<p>probably our most delicious sponsor,</p>
<p>the sponsor that has given me</p>
<p>a tremendous amount of happiness and joy, simple joy,</p>
<p>sitting alone on a couch in a podcast room,</p>
<p>just eating macadamia snacks.</p>
<p>They ship delicious, high-quality,</p>
<p>and healthy macadamia nuts directly to your door.</p>
<p>Anyway, this thing is delicious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s healthy, 30% less carbs than almonds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only nut of the many nuts,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve researched this, but they&rsquo;ve also told me</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s rich in omega-7s.</p>
<p>Professor Tim Noakes,</p>
<p>who I should probably talk to at some point,</p>
<p>sings macadamia oil praises.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much to say, that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>The thing is, it&rsquo;s just delicious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s portioned perfectly.</p>
<p>It brings happiness.</p>
<p>Get it.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;ll bring you happiness,</p>
<p>and we can just telepathically enjoy these nuts together.</p>
<p>Go to houseofmacadamias.com slash lex</p>
<p>to get 20% off your order for every order,</p>
<p>not just the first.</p>
<p>Our listeners, that&rsquo;s you,</p>
<p>will also get a four-ounce bag of macadamias</p>
<p>when you order three or more boxes</p>
<p>of any macadamia product.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s houseofmacadamias.com slash lex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Atleti Greens,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s AG1 Drink, which is an all-in-one daily drink</p>
<p>to support better health and peak performance.</p>
<p>It, too, is frickin&rsquo; delicious,</p>
<p>and it, too, is a source of a lot of happiness,</p>
<p>every day, twice a day.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m now religiously bringing in</p>
<p>on the road with me the travel packs</p>
<p>because I like to bring the happiness with me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually really stressful for me</p>
<p>to travel, as it is for a lot of people.</p>
<p>This is a recent discovery for me.</p>
<p>One of the things that kind of makes it a lot better,</p>
<p>if I bring little trinkets that remind me of home</p>
<p>or little habits that remind me of home</p>
<p>or little food items and so on,</p>
<p>and Atleti Greens is that.</p>
<p>I bring Element Electrolyte and Atleti Greens with me</p>
<p>on the road, and it just reminds me of home.</p>
<p>And Atleti Greens, that&rsquo;s what I start the day with</p>
<p>in terms of breaking my fast, and I put it in the fridge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s delicious, it&rsquo;s refreshing,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just a great mental boost for me.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you one-month supply of fish oil</p>
<p>when you sign up at atletigreens.com slash flex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by InsideTracker,</p>
<p>a service I use to track biological data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting because this conversation with Ayala</p>
<p>is, in fact, about data, a lot of data,</p>
<p>from I think she has over 500,000 people</p>
<p>that took a very extensive survey</p>
<p>on their sexual preferences and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So basically, self-report information</p>
<p>about your own understanding of your mind and body</p>
<p>and so on, I mean, that&rsquo;s so powerful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so, so, so powerful.</p>
<p>Data in general is really powerful for any kind of study,</p>
<p>for medical studies, for psychological studies,</p>
<p>sociological, for any kind of study that includes humans,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s nice to see Ayala do this gigantic data set,</p>
<p>but to figure out what you need for your body,</p>
<p>for your life, for your diet, that should not be based,</p>
<p>no matter how big the data set is,</p>
<p>that should not be based on population data,</p>
<p>or it should only be in part based on population data.</p>
<p>It should be, hopefully, in large part</p>
<p>based on the data that comes from your own body,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what InsideTracker is.</p>
<p>One of the great folks that are taking a step forward</p>
<p>in this thing that obviously represents the future.</p>
<p>Get special savings for a limited time</p>
<p>when you go to InsideTracker.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description, and now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Ayala.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>I feel like this conversation can go anywhere.</p>
<p>Is that exciting or terrifying to you?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s more exciting.</p>
<p>The uncertainty exciting to you?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>In conversations in general, or just this one?</p>
<p>I think conversations in general.</p>
<p>Like, is anybody like,</p>
<p>oh, the certainty is really exciting?</p>
<p>Maybe if the certainty is something new.</p>
<p>I mean, novelty always comes with uncertainty, right?</p>
<p>Almost always.</p>
<p>I started trying to think of a counter example.</p>
<p>Immediately.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re uncomfortable with generalizations of that kind.</p>
<p>Like, all of the things that I&rsquo;m comfortable with</p>
<p>Like, always is always a really bold word to use.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s truly novel,</p>
<p>that means you don&rsquo;t really understand it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s outside your distribution.</p>
<p>So therefore, it&rsquo;s gonna have a bunch of uncertainty.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t think of it as uncertainty.</p>
<p>You think about it as something new,</p>
<p>but it actually also attracts you</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of uncertainty surround it, probably.</p>
<p>Like, what is this new thing?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, annihilating the mystery.</p>
<p>Like, that drive.</p>
<p>What about the danger of it?</p>
<p>I was just thinking of, on the drive over,</p>
<p>because I was like,</p>
<p>a little nervous about doing this podcast.</p>
<p>And then I was like, feeling into the unpleasantness of it.</p>
<p>Like, the fear of what if something goes terribly wrong.</p>
<p>And then I was also feeling into like,</p>
<p>how much that feels like part of why it&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>Like, if I knew that it was going to go great, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Did you actually imagine all the possible ways</p>
<p>it can go wrong?</p>
<p>Not like, all of them.</p>
<p>But I was like, what if I say something really dumb?</p>
<p>Or like, you ask me a question and I answer it in a way</p>
<p>that makes me sound like a lot less capable than I am.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, really afraid of being perceived</p>
<p>as stupid or something.</p>
<p>I was also thinking about this on the way over.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m kind of risk averse in some ways.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t like driving fast in cars,</p>
<p>because I was driving very carefully here,</p>
<p>because the roads are bad.</p>
<p>And then I was thinking about,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very like, pro-risk in other ways.</p>
<p>Like, being really exposed to like,</p>
<p>a wide variety of people who might hate you.</p>
<p>And I think like, from the outside, that might look fine.</p>
<p>But I think the monkey brain is really sensitive</p>
<p>to lots of people yelling at you</p>
<p>for whatever problems that you seem to have.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the big risk you&rsquo;re taking,</p>
<p>is putting yourself out there as an intellectual,</p>
<p>like through your writing,</p>
<p>and then a lot of people yelling at you.</p>
<p>Is that the worst embarrassment you&rsquo;ve experienced?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty bad, yeah.</p>
<p>I think the worst embarrassment is if I put something</p>
<p>out there that I failed to like,</p>
<p>be properly skeptical of in myself.</p>
<p>And then people are like, oh, we caught this thing</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t catch.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the biggest terror.</p>
<p>Yeah, from looking at your reading</p>
<p>and listening to your interviews,</p>
<p>you seem to be very defensive</p>
<p>and worried about being a good scientist.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re like, methodology.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And funny enough, you get attacked on that methodology,</p>
<p>even though, you know, I&rsquo;m a fan of psychology,</p>
<p>of like, academic psychology,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of disappointing often</p>
<p>how non-rigorous their work is,</p>
<p>how small the sample size and so on,</p>
<p>and how big and ambitious, over-ambitious</p>
<p>the proclamations about results is,</p>
<p>especially with the news reports on it.</p>
<p>Now, you&rsquo;re both the researcher,</p>
<p>the scientist, and the reporter, right?</p>
<p>So like, that&rsquo;s what you have with the blog.</p>
<p>Your sample size is often gigantic.</p>
<p>The methodology is right there.</p>
<p>The data is right there.</p>
<p>You provide the data.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re like, raw and honest</p>
<p>with your interpretation of the data.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s an honesty, authenticity to it.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s actually really refreshing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why people criticize it.</p>
<p>I think this is what psychologists are probably terrified</p>
<p>about being transparent, and transparent in that way</p>
<p>is because they&rsquo;ll get attacked for their methodology.</p>
<p>So they wanna cloak it in a sort of layer of authority.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m from this institution.</p>
<p>It was peer-reviewed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s kind of all these layers,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m also not gonna share the data with you,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m also gonna pretend like</p>
<p>most psychology studies are not replicable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to pretend there&rsquo;s authority to it.</p>
<p>I think it works on a lot of people.</p>
<p>Like, from the outside, you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>ah, the scientists with the white lab coats</p>
<p>with credentials, those are the people</p>
<p>who are like, doing science.</p>
<p>And like, doing science is, you know,</p>
<p>you have like, fancy terms that other people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really understand.</p>
<p>And to be fair, like, I have a lot to learn.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still like, I&rsquo;m self-teaching.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, learning through people.</p>
<p>Learning as I go, I&rsquo;m definitely not super knowledgeable</p>
<p>about this stuff.</p>
<p>But a lot of what those people are doing in science</p>
<p>is not that hard.</p>
<p>And a lot of people, like, don&rsquo;t try to learn it</p>
<p>because it seems so, like, elevated.</p>
<p>And this is one thing that really bothers me.</p>
<p>I think, like, everybody can do science.</p>
<p>Like, if you just have this aspect of curiosity,</p>
<p>and like, you just really want to figure something out,</p>
<p>you can go and start, you know, asking people questions,</p>
<p>doing surveys, like, writing down the answers.</p>
<p>And then you can go learn how to look at that data</p>
<p>in a way that gives you more information about the world.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s very simple and straightforward.</p>
<p>If you just approach it humbly and earnestly,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, please, let&rsquo;s figure this out together.</p>
<p>But people, like, are, I think, self-crippled in this</p>
<p>because they view this as, like,</p>
<p>relegated to the domain of the experts</p>
<p>and, you know, the fancy scientists.</p>
<p>And I think that makes me feel really sad.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re almost attracted to the questions</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not supposed to ask.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Also, yes.</p>
<p>Which might contribute to the controversy.</p>
<p>Not exclusively, probably.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re just not limited by,</p>
<p>like, part of your curiosity is asking questions</p>
<p>that seem common sense.</p>
<p>Like, some of the most controversial questions</p>
<p>are, like, around sex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, everybody thinks and talks and does sex.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the driver of human civilization.</p>
<p>And yet, there&rsquo;s so little, like, rigorous discussion</p>
<p>about the philosophical</p>
<p>and the scientific questions around it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it gets really weird to be able to discuss them.</p>
<p>It becomes tricky to discuss them.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s super charged.</p>
<p>Because everybody has a really strong opinion.</p>
<p>Like, whether or not, you know,</p>
<p>pornography is damaging to society.</p>
<p>Or, like, how sex corresponds to gender.</p>
<p>Or, like, what kind of sexuality is acceptable.</p>
<p>Like, can you have sexual preferences</p>
<p>that in themselves are immoral?</p>
<p>People get very angry about it.</p>
<p>Well, the sad part is they&rsquo;re not just opinionated.</p>
<p>But most of us, our relationship with sex is,</p>
<p>I think, I guess, I want to say, not rigorous.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very difficult to be rigorous about sex.</p>
<p>And I would consider sexual urges</p>
<p>to be kind of elusive to introspection</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s a little bit disproportionate</p>
<p>to a lot of other things.</p>
<p>Like, you could, like, introspect about, you know,</p>
<p>how I want other people to like me</p>
<p>and where my insecurities lie.</p>
<p>But sex is one of those black box things.</p>
<p>A really common thing is for people to,</p>
<p>if you have a fetish,</p>
<p>you sort of check back in your childhood</p>
<p>to see an event that corresponds to that fetish.</p>
<p>And then you, like, develop a narrative.</p>
<p>Like, ah, this event in my childhood</p>
<p>must have caused this fetish.</p>
<p>And so I think this causes people to be biased</p>
<p>towards like a concrete, coherent, causative way</p>
<p>that events happen, or that sexual fetishes happen.</p>
<p>This is just like one example of like why</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really hard to be rigorous with introspection.</p>
<p>Because we can&rsquo;t avoid,</p>
<p>you just want to tend towards making like coherent narratives</p>
<p>which I think is not always the correct way to explain it.</p>
<p>The narratives that are connected to childhood</p>
<p>and so on, how they originate.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;ve, I mean, we&rsquo;ll talk about fetishes</p>
<p>because you have a lot of really interesting writing on that.</p>
<p>Just actually zooming out.</p>
<p>I should mention, you tweeted, I wrote this down.</p>
<p>You tweeted, I do not understand</p>
<p>how to have normal conversations with people in person</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m not on drugs.</p>
<p>So I guess, let&rsquo;s both agree</p>
<p>to not have a normal conversation, I guess.</p>
<p>Assuming you&rsquo;re not on drugs now.</p>
<p>Or if you are, you don&rsquo;t have to tell me.</p>
<p>I feel like a very small amount of phenibut,</p>
<p>which is a nootropic.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know if that counts.</p>
<p>Is that a drug?</p>
<p>Well, I guess I&rsquo;m on caffeine.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re both.</p>
<p>Drugged up.</p>
<p>Good enough to have a normal conversation.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>What is normal anyway?</p>
<p>What do you think is the primary driver</p>
<p>of human civilization?</p>
<p>Is it the desire for sex, love, power, or immortality?</p>
<p>Like avoiding the fear of death,</p>
<p>constructing illusions that make us forget</p>
<p>about our terror over mortality.</p>
<p>So sex, love, power, death.</p>
<p>Is this a Twitter poll?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s four options.</p>
<p>This is reality, not everything.</p>
<p>Maps perfectly to a Twitter poll.</p>
<p>But in this case, because there&rsquo;s four options,</p>
<p>and it is a small number of characters, it does.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d like to think I&rsquo;m more interested.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I think your Twitter polls are fundamentally interesting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about the brevity of a poll</p>
<p>limited to a set of choices,</p>
<p>and having an existential crisis</p>
<p>and searching for the answer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>That combination.</p>
<p>Well, this one is a big one.</p>
<p>Like, what do you think is behind it?</p>
<p>Do you believe that there is one primary driver?</p>
<p>Like, do you think that it can be understood</p>
<p>in the terms of primary drivers?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think, well, maybe it&rsquo;s an engineering perspective,</p>
<p>like trying to reverse engineer the brain.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re equipped</p>
<p>or understand enough about the mind to get there.</p>
<p>Yeah, like, what&rsquo;s the primary driver of a tree?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, then it gets to the question of what is life?</p>
<p>What is a living organism?</p>
<p>Like, to self-replicate, probably.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very clean simplification,</p>
<p>but I think life is more interesting</p>
<p>than just self-replication.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it sounds like there&rsquo;s a curiosity in you</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to, like, poke at,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t understand exactly what that curiosity is.</p>
<p>So if I had to dedicate 1,000 years</p>
<p>to understand one of these topics,</p>
<p>which one would be the most fruitful,</p>
<p>I guess is the indirect thing I&rsquo;m asking.</p>
<p>Fun?</p>
<p>No, well, fun.</p>
<p>To me, everything is fun, but-</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I&rsquo;m with David Foster Wallace.</p>
<p>The key to life is to make sure that everything&rsquo;s unboreable</p>
<p>or to be unboreable, or nothing is boring.</p>
<p>Everything is fun.</p>
<p>Like, everything.</p>
<p>I could just literally sit.</p>
<p>I honestly, because I don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where you got that glass,</p>
<p>but that glass exists, and I forgot it exists,</p>
<p>and it was really fun to me to know that now it was there.</p>
<p>What about the really unpleasant things?</p>
<p>Like, if you&rsquo;re in deep agony.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fun, because it&rsquo;s like, I mean, yeah, heartbreak.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like knowing that I&rsquo;m capable of that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all living in the gutter,</p>
<p>but some of us are looking up at the stars.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re in that gutter,</p>
<p>for some reason, the stars look brighter, right?</p>
<p>So whenever you&rsquo;re going through a difficult time</p>
<p>or whenever you see maybe other people</p>
<p>being shitty to each other,</p>
<p>it makes you really appreciate when they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>The contrast makes life kind of amazing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading a bunch of books,</p>
<p>and one of them is Brave New World,</p>
<p>where they remove the ups and downs of life,</p>
<p>partially through drugs,</p>
<p>but over over-sexualization and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>and I feel like you need the ups and downs of life.</p>
<p>The dark, you need the dark to have happiness,</p>
<p>to have like a deeply intense feeling of affection</p>
<p>towards another thing or a human being.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so everything&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>But fun is also a weird word to define,</p>
<p>because fun, I think for a lot of people,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I talk about love a lot.</p>
<p>I think love is a better word than fun,</p>
<p>because fun is like lighthearted.</p>
<p>Love is more intense.</p>
<p>Like I love that glass and the water that&rsquo;s in it,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s freaking awesome.</p>
<p>Like somebody made that glass, right?</p>
<p>And like not have many mistakes,</p>
<p>and the way it bends light in interesting ways,</p>
<p>and the way water bends light in interesting ways,</p>
<p>like I can see part of your arm through that water.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s freaking amazing.</p>
<p>Everything is amazing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with a Lego movie.</p>
<p>Anyway, but if like from a scientific perspective,</p>
<p>if I were to investigate sex,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I put love in there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just narrow it down the Twitter poll.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s focus on the basics here.</p>
<p>Sex, power, or death, immortality.</p>
<p>If I were to try to,</p>
<p>like from a neuroscience, neurobiology perspective,</p>
<p>or reverse engineer through building AI systems</p>
<p>that focus on these kinds of dynamics,</p>
<p>exploring the game theoretic aspects of it,</p>
<p>exploring the sort of cognitive modeling aspects of it,</p>
<p>which one would get me to a deeper understanding</p>
<p>of the human condition?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the question.</p>
<p>Sex.</p>
<p>Okay, Nietzsche is the will to power.</p>
<p>Freud and the bunch is all about sex.</p>
<p>And then death.</p>
<p>Liv just, Liv Burley,</p>
<p>brilliant previous guest on this podcast,</p>
<p>she just released a video where on her bedside</p>
<p>was the book Denial of Death by Ernest Becker,</p>
<p>which of course she would have on her bedside.</p>
<p>But that, his whole work is that</p>
<p>everything is motivated by our trying to escape</p>
<p>the cold, harsh reality that we&rsquo;re going to die</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re terrified of it.</p>
<p>One of the gifts and burdens for human beings</p>
<p>is that we are cognizant of our own death.</p>
<p>And that terrifies us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the theory.</p>
<p>And because of that, we do everything we can.</p>
<p>We build empires to escape the fact that we&rsquo;re mortal.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t this change quite a bit for religious people then</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t believe that they&rsquo;re going to die?</p>
<p>Well, they created religion.</p>
<p>The idea there is to create myths, religions.</p>
<p>You can create religions of all kinds.</p>
<p>Yeah, but if this is one of the defining things</p>
<p>that defines civilization,</p>
<p>then we should expect to see massive differences</p>
<p>between people who believe we&rsquo;re going to die</p>
<p>and people who don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Good, I love it.</p>
<p>You think it like scientifically here,</p>
<p>but, and they have actually answers.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a whole terror management theory</p>
<p>where they do write psychology type papers</p>
<p>and they do actual experiments.</p>
<p>I can mention how their methodology is interesting.</p>
<p>They prime with the discussion of death.</p>
<p>Like they take one certain set of people</p>
<p>and have a conversation with them.</p>
<p>And another set of people,</p>
<p>they mention death to them before the conversation</p>
<p>and see how that affects the nature of the conversation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>because death fundamentally alters</p>
<p>the nature of the conversation.</p>
<p>Just even priming,</p>
<p>like reminding you that you&rsquo;re going to die briefly</p>
<p>changes a lot of things.</p>
<p>These kinds of priming papers usually not replicated.</p>
<p>I just have like,</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;ve heard a bunch of priming ones that.</p>
<p>I think you have PTSD over psychology papers</p>
<p>that are not replicated.</p>
<p>I just did one,</p>
<p>I just did a priming experiment on my own</p>
<p>and found it didn&rsquo;t have any effect.</p>
<p>But again, it&rsquo;s not a thing.</p>
<p>Can you just give me a careless statement</p>
<p>summarizing an entire scientific discipline</p>
<p>of terror management theory?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Like I haven&rsquo;t rigorously looked at</p>
<p>how good of it is psychologically.</p>
<p>I think it is interesting philosophically,</p>
<p>the way Freud talked about the subconscious mind.</p>
<p>Philosophically, it&rsquo;s an interesting discussion.</p>
<p>Then you have to get rigorous with each for sure.</p>
<p>But the idea is that,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s not that religious people</p>
<p>get rid of the terror of death.</p>
<p>This is just one of the popular ways</p>
<p>they create an illusion on top of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that idea,</p>
<p>like a myth that allows,</p>
<p>that makes it easier for them to forget,</p>
<p>to escape that terror.</p>
<p>But everybody else does different methods.</p>
<p>Like you fill your days with,</p>
<p>like capitalism has a whole religion of itself,</p>
<p>like the rat race for getting more and more</p>
<p>material possessions and so on.</p>
<p>And couldn&rsquo;t you argue it in the opposite direction?</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s say, assume that we&rsquo;re Christians here</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re like, oh, the atheists,</p>
<p>everybody has terror of hell</p>
<p>and the atheists invent this mythology</p>
<p>where actually evolution is true</p>
<p>in order to escape their terror of hell.</p>
<p>So that doesn&rsquo;t feel like a persuasive argument to me.</p>
<p>But I used to be very, very Christian</p>
<p>and I did not have a terror of death.</p>
<p>And then I lost my faith</p>
<p>and then I had a deep terror of death</p>
<p>set in for a few years.</p>
<p>And it felt very different to me.</p>
<p>So for denial of death,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he says that it&rsquo;s actually possible</p>
<p>without really a lot of work to get to the actual terror.</p>
<p>Like, I think his claim is that</p>
<p>in early, early, early childhood development,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when the terror is real.</p>
<p>And then we aggressively construct systems around it</p>
<p>of social interaction to sort of construct illusions</p>
<p>on top of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing a half-ass description of this philosophy,</p>
<p>but it is interesting to simplify the human mind</p>
<p>into underlying mechanisms that drive it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was gonna say,</p>
<p>your thinking seems kind of poetic.</p>
<p>Like the way that you&rsquo;re sort of handling these,</p>
<p>these concepts feel like more like aesthetically driven.</p>
<p>I think this theme is gonna continue</p>
<p>throughout this conversation</p>
<p>as we talk about relationships and sex.</p>
<p>Yes, for sure.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>And I think your thinking seems to be very driven</p>
<p>by how can I construct an experiment</p>
<p>to test this hypothesis?</p>
<p>Yeah, something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, but aren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some things,</p>
<p>especially that have to do with the human mind,</p>
<p>that are really messy, really difficult to understand.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many uncertainties and mysteries around</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t yet have the tools to collect the data.</p>
<p>Like one of your favorite tools is the survey,</p>
<p>is asking people questions,</p>
<p>and then figuring out different ways</p>
<p>to indirectly get at the truth</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s flaws to the survey.</p>
<p>You kind of learn about those flaws</p>
<p>and you get better and better</p>
<p>at asking the right questions and so on.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s indirect access to the human mind.</p>
<p>But do you think like poetic narratives are?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like saying poetic narratives are bad.</p>
<p>Like I think it&rsquo;s like a cool way of like handling concepts,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not sure that they are more rigorous.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>No, but like they might be the more correct,</p>
<p>like philosophy might be the right way</p>
<p>to discuss things that were really far from understanding.</p>
<p>They might be more useful shorthand.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like morality, like I don&rsquo;t think morality makes any sense,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really useful shorthand to use</p>
<p>when handling concepts and a lot of the time.</p>
<p>Right, like ethics and morality.</p>
<p>You could construct studies that ask different questions.</p>
<p>Like just having worked with autonomous vehicles a lot,</p>
<p>the trolley problem gets brought up.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>you can construct all kinds of interesting surveys</p>
<p>about the trolley problem,</p>
<p>but does that really get at some deep moral calculus</p>
<p>that humans do?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sexy because people like write</p>
<p>clickbait articles about it,</p>
<p>but does it really get to like what you value more?</p>
<p>Five grandmas or like three children?</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>They construct these arguments of like,</p>
<p>if you could steer a train,</p>
<p>if you could steer an autonomous car, which do you choose?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>with some of those to construct.</p>
<p>Sometimes the fuzzy area,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some topics that are fuzzy</p>
<p>and will forever be fuzzy</p>
<p>given our limited cognitive capabilities.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s a way of looking at things</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, for example,</p>
<p>the childhood fetish thing that I was talking about,</p>
<p>like where do your fetishes come from?</p>
<p>Like you can develop a narrative where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you know what, I think like this kind of thing is,</p>
<p>you know, when you&rsquo;re surrounded by feet</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re a child, this causes foot fetishes.</p>
<p>And this is like kind of a cool narrative.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of people&rsquo;s ideas about philosophy</p>
<p>follow the same sort of thing.</p>
<p>Like what is the narrative that is cool?</p>
<p>And I think this is useful for meaning making.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m very pro meaning making.</p>
<p>Like when you&rsquo;re talking about everything is fun</p>
<p>because, you know, the contrast or whatever.</p>
<p>I very much ascribe to that.</p>
<p>I really enjoy that philosophy.</p>
<p>I also find everything to be very delightful.</p>
<p>And this isn&rsquo;t like a question of truth, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not like, where is the true delight</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re objectively measuring?</p>
<p>I guess this is a frame, a poetic frame</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re using to like sort of change</p>
<p>the way the light hits the world around you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s super useful</p>
<p>because it like makes you happier or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, but also gets to the truth or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess if what is the truth.</p>
<p>Yet another question.</p>
<p>What is truth?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve, actually to jump back,</p>
<p>you believe that free will is an illusion.</p>
<p>So why does it feel like I&rsquo;m free</p>
<p>to make any decision I want?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cool illusion.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s probably like where</p>
<p>our sense of identity comes from.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fun illusion.</p>
<p>Like when you really meditate on your sense of identity,</p>
<p>at least for me,</p>
<p>it seems like it comes down to the sense of choice.</p>
<p>Like, oh, I am doing the thinking.</p>
<p>Like, what does it mean to do with thinking?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, ah, something in me has exerted agency</p>
<p>over having this thought or not having this thought.</p>
<p>Like the sense of self really comes down to choice.</p>
<p>And so when I say that like free will is an illusion,</p>
<p>I also mean there&rsquo;s something like the self is an illusion.</p>
<p>Identity is a trick of the light.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a really fun one.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You think a lot about your identity.</p>
<p>I have occasionally.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like you really struggle with it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re proud of it.</p>
<p>I do too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, we have different journeys, but so.</p>
<p>I really take a lot of delight in it.</p>
<p>I used to be very into like deconstructing it.</p>
<p>Like you probably, maybe, you know,</p>
<p>I did a bunch of like way too much jealousy for a while.</p>
<p>And at that point, very no ego.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m like very ego.</p>
<p>I really enjoy having a lot of ego.</p>
<p>I actually happen to know like everything about you.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like more than you do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Wait, could you solve my problems?</p>
<p>Yes, all of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve did thorough research.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What is consciousness then?</p>
<p>I actually wrote that as a quote.</p>
<p>What is consciousness?</p>
<p>To remind myself.</p>
<p>So like how does that tie in together with free will</p>
<p>and identity and all of that?</p>
<p>What is consciousness is like</p>
<p>one of the biggest questions ever.</p>
<p>I think, I do think that people often get confused</p>
<p>when talking about consciousness</p>
<p>because I think people are referring</p>
<p>to two separate concepts</p>
<p>and often like combining them into one thing.</p>
<p>Like we asked the question, you know,</p>
<p>is AI going to be conscious?</p>
<p>I think this is kind of the wrong question.</p>
<p>Like we can identify signs of consciousness.</p>
<p>Like, ah, they seem to refer to themselves,</p>
<p>but this is not necessarily proof of consciousness</p>
<p>in the same way that like dream characters</p>
<p>acting exactly the way normal human people do</p>
<p>in your dream is not evidence</p>
<p>that they themselves are conscious.</p>
<p>So like signs of consciousness</p>
<p>are not proof of consciousness,</p>
<p>but there is something that we definitely know,</p>
<p>which is like, I currently am conscious.</p>
<p>I can tell because, right.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m like just directly observing my experience.</p>
<p>And so like there&rsquo;s one kind of consciousness,</p>
<p>which is I am directly observing my experience</p>
<p>and that you cannot replicate it.</p>
<p>Like I cannot observe two experiences.</p>
<p>It is necessarily singular and it is necessarily certain.</p>
<p>Like you can make all the arguments you want.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m still directly observing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a thing that&rsquo;s subject to reason.</p>
<p>Whereas are other things conscious?</p>
<p>This is something that&rsquo;s replicable.</p>
<p>Like you can apply it to multiple people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s not certain,</p>
<p>like almost definitionally not certain.</p>
<p>Like we don&rsquo;t actually know if there is, you know,</p>
<p>an internal experience.</p>
<p>So my argument is that like when people are talking</p>
<p>about other things having experience,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re using a different concept</p>
<p>than the thing that they&rsquo;re actually looking at</p>
<p>when they look at their own experience.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re two different things.</p>
<p>Definitionally not possible.</p>
<p>No, if you understand the mechanism of consciousness,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to measure it probably, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, but what are you measuring?</p>
<p>Like I think there&rsquo;s just like a subtle difference.</p>
<p>Like when you&rsquo;re asking the question,</p>
<p>is this other thing conscious?</p>
<p>Yeah, the easy thing to measure is like a survey.</p>
<p>Does this thing appear conscious?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then the hard thing is you understand</p>
<p>the actual mechanism of how consciousness arises</p>
<p>in the physics of the human brain.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you can do that in a dream, presumably.</p>
<p>Like if you had a very good dream or a very good simulation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But we could then have somebody in a simulation or a dream</p>
<p>where they go through and they fully understand,</p>
<p>you know, they do all the tests</p>
<p>and the tests come back exactly the way you&rsquo;d expect them to.</p>
<p>But from the outside, we&rsquo;re like, well, this is misleading.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not actually conscious.</p>
<p>Like your dream characters aren&rsquo;t conscious, right?</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, are you asking?</p>
<p>Are you telling?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like appealing to an intuition.</p>
<p>But it sounds like you&rsquo;re driving towards a narrative.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, you did a poll about men and women and dreams.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Those are some kind of difference.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t tell what the difference was</p>
<p>except that more men than women.</p>
<p>Quite a lot more women dream vividly than men.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Which I actually found in my chaos survey.</p>
<p>So I did a survey, maybe you know the,</p>
<p>I just had people-</p>
<p>I know everything, do you remember?</p>
<p>You know, yes, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>So as you clearly know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try not to talk down to you through this conversation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>And I not only know everything,</p>
<p>I know how your future looks like.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>And how everything ends, yeah.</p>
<p>So you could probably win</p>
<p>all the prediction markets on my life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>So we should also mention</p>
<p>that when you have prediction markets,</p>
<p>you have votes that you,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the site called again?</p>
<p>Manifold.</p>
<p>Manifold.</p>
<p>And one of them was,</p>
<p>will I be on the Lex Friedman podcast?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I voted.</p>
<p>I invested everything I owned into the yes.</p>
<p>Is there such thing as insider trading on there?</p>
<p>Does that, goes against the terms of the-</p>
<p>No, I think insider trading is part of the information.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s supposed to be.</p>
<p>Oh, I see.</p>
<p>And then I realized it&rsquo;s actually public information</p>
<p>that I voted.</p>
<p>I think my face shows up there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, damn it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna influence.</p>
<p>You could make the fake account.</p>
<p>Or I could be lying, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And then dump the stock or whatever.</p>
<p>You know, I try to manipulate,</p>
<p>somebody made a market,</p>
<p>like is Ayla going to post a poll,</p>
<p>spelled P-O-L-E on her Twitter,</p>
<p>like a photo.</p>
<p>And I was like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna manipulate this market.</p>
<p>So I like fucked around with it,</p>
<p>and I voted no.</p>
<p>And then I accidentally posted a photo of a poll</p>
<p>without thinking.</p>
<p>Oh, but that&rsquo;s like self-sabotage.</p>
<p>Yeah, I accidentally fucked up my own market.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like the reverse of insider trading.</p>
<p>What were we talking about?</p>
<p>Oh, the women and the men,</p>
<p>and the difference, the vivid dreams,</p>
<p>and the markets.</p>
<p>If you go with the market,</p>
<p>oh, because I can perfectly predict your future.</p>
<p>But then it&rsquo;s not fun.</p>
<p>I like the romance of unpredictability.</p>
<p>And so I like to,</p>
<p>even though I know everything,</p>
<p>I like to forget everything.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Very Buddhist of you.</p>
<p>Yeah, the river.</p>
<p>No man in the river once,</p>
<p>whatever, the footsteps,</p>
<p>however that goes.</p>
<p>One of my favorite questions is like,</p>
<p>if you could press a button</p>
<p>and then have all of your wants fulfilled,</p>
<p>anything that you want.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like such a rapid degree</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t really experience the want.</p>
<p>Like as the want arises,</p>
<p>it then is like completed as immediately</p>
<p>so that you are completely without want.</p>
<p>Like, would you,</p>
<p>would you press that button?</p>
<p>100% not.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t think you would.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Because immediately everything stops being fun.</p>
<p>The first, it&rsquo;s only fun the first time.</p>
<p>But if you want it to be fun.</p>
<p>But like, what would be my source of fun?</p>
<p>I feel like I would have,</p>
<p>on day four, just to get off,</p>
<p>I would need to do nuclear war</p>
<p>because it will escalate quickly.</p>
<p>I feel like if everything is possible,</p>
<p>I assume you mean like something</p>
<p>that is not just normal human things.</p>
<p>Yeah, magical world.</p>
<p>Magical world.</p>
<p>Then you start escalating really quickly.</p>
<p>Like, I wonder,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably do like,</p>
<p>I want everybody to just fly into the air</p>
<p>and hover in the air.</p>
<p>Everybody.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh, life is meaningless.</p>
<p>Like, why does,</p>
<p>like, you go,</p>
<p>I feel like you get,</p>
<p>no, I actually,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;d be a really interesting experiment.</p>
<p>Like, what are the limits?</p>
<p>Like, are we all capable</p>
<p>of becoming psychopaths essentially?</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;d like to believe not.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very hard limits on that,</p>
<p>like in our own mind,</p>
<p>like of basic compassion.</p>
<p>Because I love being compassionate</p>
<p>towards other human beings.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of the things I think about</p>
<p>if you give me power,</p>
<p>like a lot of power,</p>
<p>like absolute power.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the power you mentioned</p>
<p>is the scariest kind of power.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even power in this normal world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like magical power</p>
<p>where you lose,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like dream world power</p>
<p>where you,</p>
<p>like video game power.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even think of it as reality.</p>
<p>You could just mess with the world.</p>
<p>And I feel like that&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;d basically be God.</p>
<p>God, yeah.</p>
<p>But without like,</p>
<p>I feel like the idea of God</p>
<p>wants to like keep things like</p>
<p>functioning properly.</p>
<p>But then you&rsquo;d probably,</p>
<p>if you wanted to keep them functioning properly,</p>
<p>then it would rapidly,</p>
<p>like you would never experience a time</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh no, that was a mistake.</p>
<p>Because as soon as you,</p>
<p>like before you even experienced that,</p>
<p>the world would shift to match it.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>No, I think I would actually,</p>
<p>I take it back.</p>
<p>I think I would regret</p>
<p>the first time I hurt somebody.</p>
<p>See, in my visualization,</p>
<p>it was like a video game</p>
<p>where everybody&rsquo;s like NPC, really dumb.</p>
<p>No, I think the first time</p>
<p>I witnessed pain from anybody,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when I would stop.</p>
<p>And I would probably run into that very quickly.</p>
<p>Like even just the hovering,</p>
<p>make a person hover,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna be probably really upset</p>
<p>with the hovering, right?</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m gonna be like,</p>
<p>no, don&rsquo;t do that anymore.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll probably go to,</p>
<p>honestly, I&rsquo;ll just return back to my normal life.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s kind of what I feel like.</p>
<p>Like if I had the power to do anything,</p>
<p>I think I would probably want to have a life</p>
<p>very similar to where I am now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s like with Uber,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;d be probably more convenient</p>
<p>to do certain things.</p>
<p>But even then,</p>
<p>like the struggle,</p>
<p>like I got a flat tire,</p>
<p>so I have to fix that.</p>
<p>I kind of,</p>
<p>the flat tire makes everything more beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, cool.</p>
<p>I can do like a normal manual thing.</p>
<p>But also it makes you like appreciate your car,</p>
<p>appreciate transportation,</p>
<p>appreciate the convenience of transportation,</p>
<p>all of it.</p>
<p>I know some people who would like</p>
<p>call this a bunch of copium,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re just sort of making do with what you have.</p>
<p>Like we wouldn&rsquo;t go back to Amish times</p>
<p>or like pre-technology</p>
<p>because to like,</p>
<p>in order to make ourselves appreciate things more.</p>
<p>And so it seems like a hindsight reasoning,</p>
<p>which like I can appreciate that argument,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Anyone who uses, sorry,</p>
<p>to interrupt the word copium in their argumentation,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s sus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sus.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sus, my entire argument is now.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>I interrupted rudely the flow of thought.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t think so?</p>
<p>In part, you disagree with that kind of argument?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Cause I think people have this idea</p>
<p>that if you like come to accept</p>
<p>or like find meaning in what you have now,</p>
<p>this is sort of at odds with trying to improve it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t find this to be the case.</p>
<p>I find like the attempt to improve it</p>
<p>to also be part of it.</p>
<p>Like I enjoy the fact that there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>like problematic going on</p>
<p>because now I get the experience</p>
<p>of like striving to make it go away.</p>
<p>And like that in itself is where the meaning lies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just that things are bad,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that there&rsquo;s things are bad</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re trying to stop it and also.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>If you combine that with a sense of optimism</p>
<p>that the future can be better,</p>
<p>yeah, that feeds into this productive effort</p>
<p>of making things better.</p>
<p>And it somehow makes the vision of the things</p>
<p>that are better more intense.</p>
<p>Having experienced shitty things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we talked about free will and consciousness</p>
<p>and what drives human civilization.</p>
<p>Question left unanswered.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a homework problem for the reader.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get like a scoreboard at the end,</p>
<p>the amount of questions.</p>
<p>The answer?</p>
<p>Completed successfully versus not.</p>
<p>Like polls.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can we talk about some practical things?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So one of the many amazing things,</p>
<p>I think of you as a researcher,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve also been doing research in the field.</p>
<p>Yeah, field work.</p>
<p>Field work.</p>
<p>The Jane Goodall of.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Sex work.</p>
<p>How did you get,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the short and the long story</p>
<p>of how you got into sex work?</p>
<p>How did I get into sex work?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, there&rsquo;s a whole like childhood thing</p>
<p>where I was conservatively homeschooled.</p>
<p>Do you wanna actually talk about your childhood?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>because you also worked at a factory.</p>
<p>So like your childhood is really fascinating</p>
<p>and difficult, traumatic.</p>
<p>So, and you&rsquo;ve written about it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of ways we could talk about it,</p>
<p>but maybe what are the things you remember</p>
<p>the good and the bad of your childhood,</p>
<p>of your maybe interaction with your father?</p>
<p>Yeah, my dad probably has narcissistic personality disorder.</p>
<p>And so it was very centered on very controlling childhood,</p>
<p>immensely so.</p>
<p>We were homeschooled</p>
<p>and pretty isolated from the outside world.</p>
<p>Like we didn&rsquo;t know anybody else who wasn&rsquo;t homeschooled.</p>
<p>We went through a program called Growing Kids God&rsquo;s Way,</p>
<p>which was very,</p>
<p>it was like the kind of program</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not supposed to pick up babies</p>
<p>when they cry to train them</p>
<p>that they can&rsquo;t manipulate the parents.</p>
<p>Because like baby crying was viewed as like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just teaching them from an early age</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re allowed to make the parents</p>
<p>do what the kids want.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re very against this philosophy.</p>
<p>So, you know, that combined</p>
<p>with a narcissistic personality disorder,</p>
<p>dad was pretty rough.</p>
<p>So controlling.</p>
<p>Super controlling, yeah.</p>
<p>And developing and feeding the self-critical aspect</p>
<p>of your brain.</p>
<p>Yeah, very much.</p>
<p>It was, you know, I was like lazy,</p>
<p>I was never gonna accomplish anything in life.</p>
<p>I was gonna move out of the house</p>
<p>and realize how good I had it at home,</p>
<p>you know, the classic stuff.</p>
<p>He was very like logical and smart though.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;d also like teach us logic stuff.</p>
<p>I remember some of my earliest memories</p>
<p>are him like giving me basic logic puzzles.</p>
<p>Like the dog has three legs,</p>
<p>you know, how many dogs have four legs?</p>
<p>And I would mess up and,</p>
<p>but he was an evangelist,</p>
<p>basically a Christian evangelist.</p>
<p>So we did like Bible study five nights a week.</p>
<p>I memorized, I think 800 verses of the Bible</p>
<p>by the time before I became an adult.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it was very patriarchal also.</p>
<p>So I was expected to grow up and become a housewife,</p>
<p>basically.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh, you can go to college to meet a man</p>
<p>and also to get a little bit of education</p>
<p>so that you can homeschool your own kids.</p>
<p>Like we were explicitly told</p>
<p>that women were subordinate to men</p>
<p>in regards to like making decisions when you&rsquo;re married.</p>
<p>Our pastor&rsquo;s daughter was not allowed to leave home</p>
<p>because she would be outside of the authority of a man.</p>
<p>So when she got married, she was allowed to leave</p>
<p>because she was never allowed to live in a house</p>
<p>where she was not under a hierarchy.</p>
<p>So this is like the kind of culture that we live in.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a hierarchy</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a gender aspect to the hierarchy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s men at the top of that hierarchy.</p>
<p>Men at the top.</p>
<p>Okay, but your own psychology, your own mind.</p>
<p>So most of that self-critical brain is bad, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s confusing, because he told me that I was smart,</p>
<p>but also that I would fail.</p>
<p>But not smart enough, right?</p>
<p>Or like smart, but not smart enough.</p>
<p>Smart, but like not virtuous or something.</p>
<p>Okay, right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always a flaw.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always a flaw.</p>
<p>I think a lot of the fucked upness of my brain</p>
<p>came from feeling like I didn&rsquo;t have the authority to think.</p>
<p>Because it was so carefully suppressed.</p>
<p>My ability to express or have any sort of power</p>
<p>was just absolutely annihilated.</p>
<p>Like systemically, psychologically,</p>
<p>they would do psychological torture mechanisms</p>
<p>to make sure that I wasn&rsquo;t actually thinking on my own.</p>
<p>Or like being able to deviate</p>
<p>from anything anybody ever told me.</p>
<p>To the degree that it&rsquo;s still ingrained in me.</p>
<p>Like I once was with a friend, we were traveling,</p>
<p>and he wanted me to hop a turnstile.</p>
<p>It was like very late at night, the train was here,</p>
<p>and I could not physically force myself to do it.</p>
<p>Like he was like yelling at me, like, come on, do it.</p>
<p>I was trying so hard to make my body cross the line.</p>
<p>And it was just, it&rsquo;s like embedded in my physical being</p>
<p>to like be unable to do stuff like that,</p>
<p>which is really annoying.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not free to take action in this world.</p>
<p>Yeah, some of them.</p>
<p>So that was, I think, the most annoying part</p>
<p>of my upbringing.</p>
<p>Would you classify it as like suffering?</p>
<p>At the time, yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s confusing because like when I was a child,</p>
<p>it was just painful in the sense that like things suck.</p>
<p>But it was placed in a meaning framework, right?</p>
<p>Like it is good, it is virtuous</p>
<p>to submit to your parents and do what they want.</p>
<p>If they tell you to say goodbye to your best friend forever</p>
<p>and never talk to them again,</p>
<p>you go do that without complaining.</p>
<p>And so like I would go do something like that</p>
<p>and I would, like, it would suck.</p>
<p>It really was like concretely painful,</p>
<p>but it was also placed in this narrative</p>
<p>where I was like fulfilling some sort of greater purpose.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s very confusing to refer to it as suffering</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so many painful things we do today</p>
<p>that are placed in the narrative of a greater purpose</p>
<p>that like I think I would agree with.</p>
<p>Like I go get a medical procedure done and that sucks,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m like, ah, this is helping me in the long run.</p>
<p>But like say if I got abducted to an alien planet</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, by the way,</p>
<p>all of those medical procedures you got done,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t have to get them done,</p>
<p>those are totally unnecessary,</p>
<p>then I might get really upset about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wouldn&rsquo;t trust those aliens though</p>
<p>because they probably want to do</p>
<p>different medical procedures than I do.</p>
<p>This is true.</p>
<p>I saw a thumbnail for a video</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m proud of myself for not clicking on</p>
<p>about a man who&rsquo;s claimed that he had sex with aliens.</p>
<p>And I was like-</p>
<p>Proud of yourself for not clicking on that?</p>
<p>Because I was wondering,</p>
<p>because I would probably watch it for like 20 minutes</p>
<p>and then I should be doing work.</p>
<p>Oh, I see.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m actually happy because I get to imagine</p>
<p>all the different possibilities that it could have been</p>
<p>for that man who had sex with aliens.</p>
<p>Did you have like a really high resting happiness state?</p>
<p>Yes, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably like a mushroom state, yeah.</p>
<p>Wow, do you do mushrooms?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done mushrooms before.</p>
<p>It was very awesome, but like more intensely awesome.</p>
<p>Because I was just looking at nature,</p>
<p>it makes nature even more beautiful, I think.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s already pretty beautiful.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done MDMA.</p>
<p>People say that I should.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very nice, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, anyway.</p>
<p>But I already, yeah.</p>
<p>What did you call it?</p>
<p>Resting happiness state?</p>
<p>Yeah, high resting happiness.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a good way to describe it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not like, some of it is genetic</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re able to notice the beauty in the world</p>
<p>and some of it is practiced</p>
<p>where you realize focusing on the negative things in life,</p>
<p>like unproductively is,</p>
<p>it just doesn&rsquo;t help your mind flourish.</p>
<p>So like you just notice that and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I mean, I think people with like depression learn that</p>
<p>or like probably with trauma too</p>
<p>is like there&rsquo;s certain triggers.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re, if you suffer from depression,</p>
<p>you have to kind of consciously know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be triggers that will spiral,</p>
<p>like force you to spiral down.</p>
<p>And so just avoid those triggers.</p>
<p>Some people have that with diet, with food and so on.</p>
<p>And so I just don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>whenever there&rsquo;s a shady things happening or shady people,</p>
<p>unless I can help, unless I can somehow help,</p>
<p>like why focus on it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Back to your upbringing.</p>
<p>What was the journey of escaping that?</p>
<p>I, well, I left home like kind of early</p>
<p>because my dad and I were not getting along</p>
<p>by the time I was a teenager,</p>
<p>but I was still Christian for a while.</p>
<p>And I lost my faith after I think I moved away</p>
<p>and I started having friends that weren&rsquo;t religious</p>
<p>or like weren&rsquo;t raised in this super conservative environment</p>
<p>that I came from.</p>
<p>And I think I, this was not conscious at the time.</p>
<p>This is my hindsight story,</p>
<p>but I believe that like being exposed to a culture</p>
<p>in which I had the capacity to believe,</p>
<p>allowed my brain to actually seriously consider</p>
<p>the thought that maybe all of this stuff was untrue,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d been taught like 6,000 year old earth</p>
<p>and evolution is a lie, macro evolution</p>
<p>and all of this stuff.</p>
<p>Because when you&rsquo;re immersed in an environment like that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you actually have a choice.</p>
<p>Like your brain has to believe these things</p>
<p>because this is a survival thing.</p>
<p>Like if you believe this, you&rsquo;ll be,</p>
<p>like if you believe the wrong thing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be totally cast out.</p>
<p>Even if they&rsquo;re not gonna cast you out,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be cast out in like communion with others</p>
<p>because we were always told</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t like trust non-believers really.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have a moral compass.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna screw you over.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m like, oh, I can&rsquo;t be that.</p>
<p>Like everybody&rsquo;s gonna outcast me internally.</p>
<p>So anyway, I wasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I actually had the capacity</p>
<p>to seriously question my faith,</p>
<p>even though I thought that I was questioning it quite hard</p>
<p>until I got into an environment where it was safe to do so.</p>
<p>And once I started being able to make friends</p>
<p>who were not religious, I&rsquo;m like, oh, if I lose my faith,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still gonna have some sort of community.</p>
<p>And then at that time I went through some questioning</p>
<p>and then I lost my faith.</p>
<p>So in that, given your friends, given your situation,</p>
<p>you have, you now have the freedom to think essentially.</p>
<p>Or at least the ability to think</p>
<p>of something that was acceptable in the new culture, yeah.</p>
<p>Without, I mean, is there a danger</p>
<p>of like adopting the beliefs of the new culture?</p>
<p>So like there&rsquo;s some aspect</p>
<p>of just being able to think freely,</p>
<p>which you weren&rsquo;t able to do when you were growing up,</p>
<p>just to think, like look at the world</p>
<p>and wonder how it works, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>I mean, you were, but within certain boundaries,</p>
<p>like there are certain basic assumptions.</p>
<p>And as long as you were following those basic assumptions,</p>
<p>which is to be fair, it&rsquo;s like kind of what we&rsquo;re doing now.</p>
<p>Like we have, have I gone and done the personal research</p>
<p>that like evolution is the thing that&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>Have I looked at like the age of the stones?</p>
<p>No, I haven&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m trusting other people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which I think is like a fair choice to make</p>
<p>given where I&rsquo;m at right now.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re also assuming like there&rsquo;s causality</p>
<p>in the universe, time is real.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like that, first of all,</p>
<p>the thing that your senses are perceiving is real.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re assuming a lot of things.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think like it&rsquo;s better just to become aware</p>
<p>of the assumptions you&rsquo;re making,</p>
<p>like as opposed to not making those assumptions at all.</p>
<p>Like you have to assume something.</p>
<p>And I did, it&rsquo;s very suspicious, right?</p>
<p>That I went out of this very conservative culture</p>
<p>and now, well, I guess I don&rsquo;t believe things</p>
<p>that are super in line with the current culture.</p>
<p>I think this is why I feel a little bit safer right now</p>
<p>because like when I was Christian,</p>
<p>I believed generally Christian things.</p>
<p>But now I believe a bunch of things</p>
<p>that like people really hate.</p>
<p>Like I get canceled online all the time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, this is a sign</p>
<p>that maybe you&rsquo;re thinking independently</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re like able to think things</p>
<p>that are completely at odds with the people around you.</p>
<p>And to be fair, this is a little bit easier to do</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s like general culture,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s much harder to do with your peer group.</p>
<p>Like the people that you trust, your friends,</p>
<p>the people whose opinions you respect,</p>
<p>like disagreeing with those people is very difficult</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not very good at it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do think that if you establish yourself</p>
<p>as a person who can be trusted</p>
<p>and is a good human being,</p>
<p>you have a lot more freedom to then explore ideas</p>
<p>that are different from your peer group.</p>
<p>So like those seem,</p>
<p>if you separate the space of ideas</p>
<p>versus some kind of like deeper sense</p>
<p>of what this person is,</p>
<p>like that they&rsquo;re an interesting</p>
<p>and trustworthy and good human being.</p>
<p>Well, is there somebody that you respect</p>
<p>who you consider significantly smarter than you?</p>
<p>And can you imagine believing an idea</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve heard them talk really disdainfully about?</p>
<p>Like, how would you feel coming to me?</p>
<p>Like, I believe this thing that you find to be.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do all the time.</p>
<p>Oh yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You may be braver than me.</p>
<p>And to be fair, I support doing this.</p>
<p>Like I try to do this, but I think like subconsciously,</p>
<p>I noticed that I don&rsquo;t do it as much.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m suspicious of myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh, I wonder if I&rsquo;m hiding to myself</p>
<p>like actual curiosity about things</p>
<p>that might deviate from my peer group.</p>
<p>Because I noticed that I&rsquo;m not actually deviating with them</p>
<p>as much as I do with the outside world.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, like, because I do see most people I interact with</p>
<p>as smarter than me,</p>
<p>but I also have this intuitive feeling that dumb people,</p>
<p>which I consider myself being, have wisdom.</p>
<p>So like in the disagreement,</p>
<p>actually, I also believe in the power of conversation</p>
<p>and in the tension of disagreement.</p>
<p>So I think even just disagreeing from a place,</p>
<p>from a good place, from a place of like love</p>
<p>and respect for each other,</p>
<p>I think I just believe in that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like individuals, you&rsquo;re disagreeing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like working towards arriving</p>
<p>at some deeper truth together, right?</p>
<p>Even if the other person is smarter.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s how I justify it for myself.</p>
<p>I just, I&rsquo;m also a fan of conversations</p>
<p>because like I&rsquo;ve seen just listening to conversations.</p>
<p>It seems like a great conversation more emerges from it</p>
<p>than the sum of its parts, right?</p>
<p>Like somehow two people together can do,</p>
<p>like that dance of ideas can somehow create a cool thing.</p>
<p>By the way, I enjoyed, I saw a video of you dancing</p>
<p>at a bar drunk.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the bar drunk, it didn&rsquo;t look drunk,</p>
<p>but just the dancing.</p>
<p>It was like ballroom dancing type of thing.</p>
<p>I was like, yeah.</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a bit of tango dancing.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Argentine?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>I like stuff with the body in general,</p>
<p>like wrestling or combat.</p>
<p>Usually when there&rsquo;s a tension,</p>
<p>you have to understand the mechanics</p>
<p>of how two bodies move when they&rsquo;re in conflict</p>
<p>and dancing is similar.</p>
<p>Like you have to do like rapid thinking also,</p>
<p>like rapid intuitive physical thinking.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s my favorite kind of thing.</p>
<p>Like a lot of exercise is really boring to me</p>
<p>because you can just do it while your brain&rsquo;s off.</p>
<p>But something like ballroom dancing or fusion dancing,</p>
<p>like you have to constantly be like figuring out,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a rapid puzzle.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s so wonderful.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s fusion dancing?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the video.</p>
<p>Fusion dancing is like,</p>
<p>if you have any sort of dance background,</p>
<p>you can come and you just kind of mix those together.</p>
<p>Oh, you just improvise.</p>
<p>So you can have people doing ballet,</p>
<p>with people doing ballroom,</p>
<p>with people doing blues.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s an interesting dynamic</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s very meta.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s usually a lead and a follow.</p>
<p>I guess most dances have that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so that,</p>
<p>but both have a different,</p>
<p>like you both have to be quite sensitive</p>
<p>to the other human being,</p>
<p>but in a different way.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I like both that there is that definitive role,</p>
<p>but also like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not somehow that one is better than the other.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a interesting tension between the two.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool because it&rsquo;s like a basic rule set</p>
<p>that allows for a ton of expression.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently started to experiment</p>
<p>with like reverse leading.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like back leading.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>like sometimes I&rsquo;ll like lead a move.</p>
<p>So you can lead as a follow.</p>
<p>Oh, you can lead.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m typically following,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll like occasionally throw in a little lead</p>
<p>here and there.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you kind of follow it?</p>
<p>Oh, I see.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you hint at a lead when you&rsquo;re following?</p>
<p>Like, don&rsquo;t you, just by the dynamics of your movement,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not perfectly following.</p>
<p>I mean, because there is like,</p>
<p>the lead is listening to your body, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So like, you&rsquo;re kind of both figuring out</p>
<p>what you do next.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a very good follow though.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m an invisible follow.</p>
<p>You do a move, it&rsquo;s like I.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like good at technique.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know those existed,</p>
<p>like a perfect follow.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, perfect.</p>
<p>So you can perfect follow.</p>
<p>I really, I do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not great at technique and sometimes I&rsquo;ll fall over,</p>
<p>but like with the following part, I&rsquo;m very good at.</p>
<p>Do you enjoy following?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really nice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s again, like it&rsquo;s a very fast physical puzzle</p>
<p>you have to solve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like typing.</p>
<p>I really like typing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I was inquiring about your keyboard earlier.</p>
<p>Why do you like typing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the very fast, like the really rapid response.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the, reaction time.</p>
<p>I like things that like have very fast reaction times,</p>
<p>like games like that.</p>
<p>But typing is not a reaction</p>
<p>or is it the brain generating words?</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>cause typing a reaction.</p>
<p>Okay, the sensation that I get when I am typing</p>
<p>is the kind of thing that I&rsquo;m trying to point out.</p>
<p>So maybe reaction time isn&rsquo;t the quite,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the term is,</p>
<p>but whatever that thing is,</p>
<p>like the thing where you have to like look at a word</p>
<p>and then communicate it into your fingers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It feels like dancing.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re responding.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re responding to your brain.</p>
<p>Your fingers are doing the responding to the brain</p>
<p>that generated the words.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Making your body do what your brain wants it to do,</p>
<p>but like fast and precisely.</p>
<p>Oh, then you might not like this Kinesis keyboard</p>
<p>cause it makes it easier to do that.</p>
<p>You probably like the struggle, right?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it looks hard</p>
<p>because it looks like it&rsquo;s high depression on the keys.</p>
<p>No, well, oh, I see.</p>
<p>Yes, more than like a laptop keyboard,</p>
<p>but like that you don&rsquo;t have to,</p>
<p>one of the main things is</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to move your fingers at all.</p>
<p>So like, for example, a lot of people,</p>
<p>I think they have a backspace up in the top right corner.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So if you have to make mistakes, which is like,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s like so metaphorical,</p>
<p>like every mistake you have to like really hurt yourself for</p>
<p>cause you have to like stretch for the backspace.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that poetic narrative again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it emanates from like a lot</p>
<p>of your perspective.</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>Yeah, no.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t, and I see it as a good thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good, like a romantic element</p>
<p>permeates my interpretation of the world.</p>
<p>Yes, but you left home early.</p>
<p>How did you end up working at a factory?</p>
<p>I tried to go to college, but failed.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t afford it.</p>
<p>Did you like it?</p>
<p>I remember it just being really slow.</p>
<p>I remember being shocked that the teachers didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Like I was used to homeschooling.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And where, I don&rsquo;t know, like educate,</p>
<p>it just like, it meant something.</p>
<p>It felt like the people around me that were teaching me,</p>
<p>cause we had like a mom&rsquo;s group also,</p>
<p>like directly cared about what I was learning.</p>
<p>And I would be able to ask questions</p>
<p>and they would like really respond.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a mom&rsquo;s group?</p>
<p>And it was like a homeschooling group.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re a bunch of moms who are homeschooling their kids,</p>
<p>get together and then teach each other&rsquo;s kids.</p>
<p>Oh, cool.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And they have different like interests and capabilities</p>
<p>and so on and they kind of.</p>
<p>And sometimes if some of the kids are really good</p>
<p>at something you have like the older kids teaching</p>
<p>the other ones too.</p>
<p>So it was very like,</p>
<p>everybody kind of figures out what they&rsquo;re good at</p>
<p>and they share that skillset with everybody else,</p>
<p>which I think was a pretty great setup.</p>
<p>Honestly, I think my childhood kind of sucked</p>
<p>in a lot of ways,</p>
<p>but homeschooling was excellent for me,</p>
<p>mainly because it just had so much free time.</p>
<p>Like I just did like two to three hours of school</p>
<p>and then did whatever the fuck I wanted</p>
<p>for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>And I got to actually pursue skills</p>
<p>that are still useful for me to this day, so.</p>
<p>Even in that constrained environment.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve read fantasy books and I wrote so much</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m writing a lot for my blog, so.</p>
<p>What kind of fantasy books?</p>
<p>Like sci-fi type stuff?</p>
<p>Like classic, like I read like Mercedes Lackey</p>
<p>and the E.E. Knight and Ursula Le Guin and.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know any of this.</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Is it like a romantic thing or is it like,</p>
<p>is it romance?</p>
<p>Just all the fantasy books.</p>
<p>Like dragons and elves.</p>
<p>Oh, dragons.</p>
<p>Got it, got it, got it, got it.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t mention Tolkien for the fantasy.</p>
<p>I read Tolkien.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>So you threw all the dragons.</p>
<p>How did you end up in a factory?</p>
<p>You tried school.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I tried school.</p>
<p>Had to drop out for a couple of months</p>
<p>and then I was like, well, I&rsquo;m poor</p>
<p>and I was ready to take any job.</p>
<p>I was like applying for sewer jobs</p>
<p>and then I got a factory.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, all right, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>Because my parents, no financial help at all.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, you pull yourself up by your own bootstraps.</p>
<p>So anyway, I went to work in a factory</p>
<p>and that sucked ass.</p>
<p>Do not recommend.</p>
<p>Wake up like 4 a.m., work on weekends too.</p>
<p>Fluorescent lights.</p>
<p>It was terrible.</p>
<p>And so I did that for about a year</p>
<p>and I was like, this is,</p>
<p>I was trying to grip my teeth and be like,</p>
<p>this is my life, right?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have high expectations for my life.</p>
<p>I was just like, I thought like if you get a job</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t have to be on your feet all the time,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re living a good life.</p>
<p>But, and then I got another job briefly as a photographer</p>
<p>and then they fired me.</p>
<p>I think I was 19 at the time.</p>
<p>Fired you for like-</p>
<p>I was just too young.</p>
<p>And really, really bad at interacting with people</p>
<p>in the outside world.</p>
<p>Like I was pretty well socialized as a homeschooler</p>
<p>with other homeschoolers.</p>
<p>But in the outside world,</p>
<p>especially with all of the like hierarchy submission stuff</p>
<p>beaten into me, like literally beaten into me,</p>
<p>it was very difficult for me to interact with other people</p>
<p>who were like older than me</p>
<p>or had any sort of confidence at all.</p>
<p>So they hired me to do like photography for people</p>
<p>and then I was rapidly, turned out that I was bad at this.</p>
<p>And so they fired me.</p>
<p>But at that point I&rsquo;d left my factory job.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I can&rsquo;t go back to the factory.</p>
<p>I had some savings and I slept on friends&rsquo; couches</p>
<p>and I tried various self-employment stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, maybe I can do product photography or something.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s Idaho, you know?</p>
<p>Nothing, and if you&rsquo;re like a 19-year-old</p>
<p>with no experience in the outside world at all,</p>
<p>it was really difficult.</p>
<p>And so I had a friend recommend</p>
<p>that I try becoming a cam girl.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how it started.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, what is camming?</p>
<p>What is being a cam girl?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that called?</p>
<p>Camming is like you talk to the camera live</p>
<p>on the computer, like you live stream.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like Twitch.</p>
<p>And then people are typing in the chat,</p>
<p>like, hi, I do this stuff.</p>
<p>And then the people can tip you money</p>
<p>and then you can do things in response.</p>
<p>Like, oh, if you tip me a hundred tokens,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;ll take my shirt off or something like that.</p>
<p>And like, what&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>what site were you using at that time?</p>
<p>My free cams.</p>
<p>My free cams?</p>
<p>Is that a popular site?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s pretty popular.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And how did, what were the next steps?</p>
<p>Like, did you enjoy it?</p>
<p>Oh, well, it was the first time</p>
<p>I had actual control over my life.</p>
<p>And I made like actual real money.</p>
<p>And so I just exploded into it.</p>
<p>I thought about it nonstop.</p>
<p>I was streaming all the time.</p>
<p>I was like coming up with like new creative things.</p>
<p>And the thing is like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about public school that,</p>
<p>I ended up living in a house of cam girls</p>
<p>full of other girls who had gone to public school.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if how much of it&rsquo;s genetic</p>
<p>or like just because I&rsquo;m weird</p>
<p>or is it because of our upbringing?</p>
<p>But I felt like I was much more fearless</p>
<p>and much more weird and creative online</p>
<p>than other people were.</p>
<p>Not because they weren&rsquo;t awesome people,</p>
<p>but because I think like public school,</p>
<p>I got the impression based on them talking about it</p>
<p>that it sort of like beats out any sort of deviance from you.</p>
<p>Like-</p>
<p>More so than your, cause I got the-</p>
<p>We had moral deviance was beaten out,</p>
<p>but like you could do whatever.</p>
<p>Creative deviance was not-</p>
<p>Creative deviance wasn&rsquo;t so much.</p>
<p>Like I didn&rsquo;t have other kids making fun of me ever.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d ever heard an insult</p>
<p>about my physical appearance as a child or teenager once.</p>
<p>So your father was basically saying</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not good enough was intellectual.</p>
<p>Oh no, that was like moral failing.</p>
<p>Moral failing.</p>
<p>Yeah, like I was not virtuous.</p>
<p>Oh wow.</p>
<p>Like in various ways.</p>
<p>Like, you know, like you&rsquo;re lazy</p>
<p>and mostly the lazy part.</p>
<p>I have like ADHD or something.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it was, I was not good at it as a kid either.</p>
<p>I would totally forget all the time and-</p>
<p>Is there some sexual repression aspect to that?</p>
<p>Like, you know how they say that there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not just homeschooling,</p>
<p>but just like Catholic girls and so on,</p>
<p>just because like there&rsquo;s moral,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re forbidden to do certain things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s a kind of liberating feeling of saying,</p>
<p>like basically rediscovering yourself,</p>
<p>rediscovering your freedom by doing just diving head in,</p>
<p>head first into sexuality, into your own sexuality.</p>
<p>Is there some aspect to that?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely to some degree.</p>
<p>I think that like people kind of model it slightly wrong.</p>
<p>Like, I think there&rsquo;s a truth to it.</p>
<p>But when I first got out of the house,</p>
<p>for me, freedom was like going outside at 2 a.m.</p>
<p>or like eating chocolate, you know,</p>
<p>on days that I previously wasn&rsquo;t allowed to eat chocolate.</p>
<p>Like that was like a really intense expression</p>
<p>of rebellion for me.</p>
<p>And I think people like, don&rsquo;t think of this,</p>
<p>like I got out a lot of my like intense rebellion</p>
<p>through things that people don&rsquo;t typically consider</p>
<p>to be rebellious at all.</p>
<p>Sure. Like I wore a bikini.</p>
<p>Yeah. Insane.</p>
<p>I just like walked around in it and like, I can do this.</p>
<p>Yeah, basically.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so like, this was most of that</p>
<p>emotional processing for me.</p>
<p>And it took me a couple of years from leaving home</p>
<p>and all of that conservative culture into doing sex work.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I was,</p>
<p>I did try having sex with a lot of people,</p>
<p>but this was mainly because</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what the norms were.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really understand.</p>
<p>I was just like, okay, take things logically,</p>
<p>take things one step at a time.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, okay, if the whole previous set</p>
<p>about like how I&rsquo;m not supposed to kiss somebody</p>
<p>until the altar of marriage,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s not the way that things are supposed to go,</p>
<p>then what is the way things are supposed to go?</p>
<p>And I was like, well, if I am aroused,</p>
<p>I should go have sex with someone, right?</p>
<p>Is there any reason not to?</p>
<p>No. So I went, I just,</p>
<p>I would go around asking random people to have sex with me.</p>
<p>Did you have any peer pressure saying like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not good, or that is good, or like any,</p>
<p>did you feel any currents of society in any direction?</p>
<p>Or are you independently just thinking like,</p>
<p>from first principles?</p>
<p>I think, I mean,</p>
<p>like, I&rsquo;m not saying it was a totally clean thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that I was experiencing society</p>
<p>telling me this is bad.</p>
<p>But you have to know,</p>
<p>like I wasn&rsquo;t watching normal movies when I was a teen.</p>
<p>Like we watched Christian movies,</p>
<p>or the stuff that we watched was filtered.</p>
<p>Like I watched the Titanic</p>
<p>and I had no idea that Jack and Rose had sex</p>
<p>because it was put through a filtered-</p>
<p>Wait, did they?</p>
<p>Yeah, they went and, you know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d painted her naked and-</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>There was a scene in a car, on the ship.</p>
<p>In a car, on the ship?</p>
<p>Yeah, on the, they had like stored cars in storage</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a hand.</p>
<p>I watched it again later.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh my God.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the sex scene.</p>
<p>Well, maybe were you also put through a filtered version?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s the filter I see,</p>
<p>like did the couple in the notebook also have sex?</p>
<p>Because maybe for romantic movies,</p>
<p>I focus on the romance, maybe, right?</p>
<p>And the sex scenes are always like weirdly filmed</p>
<p>in these-</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s never, I mean,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t, it feels more like romance than sex.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s the main focus of this, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, anyway.</p>
<p>So they had sex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to know now.</p>
<p>They did, I&rsquo;m letting it go.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go back and watch now.</p>
<p>You have your own personal filter on your brain.</p>
<p>And once you realize that there are some,</p>
<p>like the foundation of your beliefs were wrong,</p>
<p>then everything might be wrong</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re kind of just doing</p>
<p>from first principles explode.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was like from first principles, basically.</p>
<p>And again, like not totally separate from culture,</p>
<p>but also I think in general,</p>
<p>I also have a predisposition to just be like,</p>
<p>you know, fuck what culture tells you,</p>
<p>just figure out what&rsquo;s right for you and do it.</p>
<p>And so that mixed with, you know,</p>
<p>the figuring things out from first principles.</p>
<p>I did eventually figure out that I didn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>having casual sex with just anybody quite as much.</p>
<p>So I stopped that, but it took me a while to figure that out.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the negative of casual sex?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like not good.</p>
<p>I mean, if you like figure out the chemistry</p>
<p>you have with someone better,</p>
<p>then it can be a lot nicer, but I wasn&rsquo;t doing that.</p>
<p>I was just like somebody I met and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>you seem kind of cute.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Like I didn&rsquo;t bother to try and develop any chemistry.</p>
<p>I mean, I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Chemistry even outside of sex,</p>
<p>just chemistry, like human chemistry,</p>
<p>like conversation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I would, it&rsquo;s like kind of cringy,</p>
<p>but I would like walk up to guys or send them messages.</p>
<p>Like, would you like to have coitus is what I would say.</p>
<p>You would say coitus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d said that.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of cute in a way.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a girl asking you to get laid,</p>
<p>so they probably didn&rsquo;t care that much.</p>
<p>But anyway, I&rsquo;m saying that like,</p>
<p>I had a lot of rebellion out of my system</p>
<p>by the time I started sex work.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So like for me, like maybe I&rsquo;m sure it was somehow related</p>
<p>because we were extremely sexually repressed growing up.</p>
<p>I remember the day I learned I had a vagina,</p>
<p>which was absolutely horrifying.</p>
<p>Do not recommend figuring out</p>
<p>you have another orifice in your body.</p>
<p>But like-</p>
<p>Do you want to share the process of you</p>
<p>figuring out that you had a vagina?</p>
<p>Actually, they told me I had a vagina.</p>
<p>Oh, like intellectually,</p>
<p>like there was somebody said you have a vagina.</p>
<p>Vagina, yeah.</p>
<p>And that was horrifying to you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know I had,</p>
<p>because you weren&rsquo;t supposed to ever like</p>
<p>touch or look at yourself ever.</p>
<p>So I never did.</p>
<p>It was really disgusting.</p>
<p>And so I had no idea</p>
<p>that what was going on in my genital region.</p>
<p>And so one day my mom sat me down,</p>
<p>I think I was like nine or 10.</p>
<p>And she was like, you have a,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another ovary.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to bleed out of it,</p>
<p>is what she told me.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to bleed out of it for a while.</p>
<p>And I was like, what the fuck, mom?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what the word fuck was,</p>
<p>but I would have said that if I had known.</p>
<p>When did you first learn the word fuck?</p>
<p>Oh, I think I learned it when I was at a playground</p>
<p>and it was written somewhere and I read it out loud.</p>
<p>And then the kid next to me started giggling.</p>
<p>Did you ever, did you say fuck again for a while?</p>
<p>No, I think the next time I said,</p>
<p>I swore the first time I was 18.</p>
<p>Like intentionally said a swear word when I was 18.</p>
<p>Did it feel good?</p>
<p>I was like really nervous.</p>
<p>I was like nervous.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite swear word?</p>
<p>I mean, fuck&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>Yeah, fuck&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s camming.</p>
<p>I mean, what are the pros and cons of camming?</p>
<p>And how does OnlyFans map into this?</p>
<p>Did you switch to OnlyFans at some point?</p>
<p>I did, yeah.</p>
<p>That came for like five or six years</p>
<p>and I burned out eventually.</p>
<p>What are the good aspects?</p>
<p>What are the bad aspects of camming?</p>
<p>Well, the good aspects were that</p>
<p>it was just your own terms.</p>
<p>You get to decide.</p>
<p>Everything about it is under your control,</p>
<p>which I loved at the time.</p>
<p>I was like, I can work when I want, how I want,</p>
<p>any sort of expression I experimented.</p>
<p>And I was very successful.</p>
<p>I was making around $200 an hour,</p>
<p>which for that website at the time was like pretty good.</p>
<p>I had elaborate routines.</p>
<p>I was a mime.</p>
<p>I would dress up as a mime and then dress up a chair</p>
<p>and I would seduce the chair.</p>
<p>Oh, cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, or like-</p>
<p>Was there an artistic element to it almost?</p>
<p>Yeah, very much.</p>
<p>Did you talk to the chair?</p>
<p>You had gnomes?</p>
<p>No, I was a mime.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry, right.</p>
<p>Yeah, get it straight, dude.</p>
<p>You know what I really appreciate about you</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m asking some really dumb questions</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re answering it in a very intelligent way,</p>
<p>so I appreciate that.</p>
<p>Did you ask the chair questions?</p>
<p>I was a mime, you fucking idiot.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gnomes on the, like big gnomes or small gnomes?</p>
<p>Like lawn gnomes.</p>
<p>Lawn gnomes?</p>
<p>And you seduced the lawn gnome on the chair?</p>
<p>The gnome was sitting on the chair?</p>
<p>There were some, yeah, gnomes on the chair.</p>
<p>I did a photo set, which I submitted to Reddit,</p>
<p>where I got abducted.</p>
<p>I was like stripping, taking my clothes off,</p>
<p>and then slowly the gnomes surrounded me in the background</p>
<p>and then dragged me off.</p>
<p>And I did this as a photo set and I-</p>
<p>Consensually?</p>
<p>I mean, I didn&rsquo;t feel consensual in the photos, but-</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But it was the 11th-</p>
<p>Consensual, not consensual, the gnomes.</p>
<p>It was very successful on Reddit, basically.</p>
<p>It was the top post on Gone Wild</p>
<p>and the 11th top post of all time on Reddit.</p>
<p>Which I think probably just means it&rsquo;s artistic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting, it&rsquo;s edgy, it&rsquo;s funny,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s really, really well done.</p>
<p>But it was really shocking to me</p>
<p>that nobody else was doing anything creative with sex work.</p>
<p>Like for me, it was like breathing.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re just doing sex and you&rsquo;re bored,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what do you do?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, let&rsquo;s try something funny.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just the natural progression.</p>
<p>And it felt to me like there was almost no competition.</p>
<p>Like I would just be really creative</p>
<p>and like immediately it was the top</p>
<p>not safe for work post on Reddit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, I didn&rsquo;t even try that hard.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really shocking to me</p>
<p>that other women who are doing this sort of thing.</p>
<p>Is that still a little bit of the case?</p>
<p>Like that there&rsquo;s not as much like,</p>
<p>because from my sort of outsider perspective,</p>
<p>that seems to be still the case.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s not, like as you describe it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of cool.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like almost like playing,</p>
<p>like having fun with sexuality almost.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And yeah, but that does require kind of thinking through,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like a creative project,</p>
<p>like a photography project or something like that.</p>
<p>Almost like a little skit movie.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this vibe of like,</p>
<p>how can you like bring like vibrant novelty</p>
<p>to whatever you&rsquo;re doing, anything you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And I really like doing this with surveys too.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of standard surveys,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also like experimenting</p>
<p>with novel creative artistic surveys.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, how do you ask a question</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s like beautiful and unusual?</p>
<p>And like a thing that&rsquo;s completely groundbreaking.</p>
<p>Like nobody&rsquo;s ever like-</p>
<p>You always make everything so poetic</p>
<p>and romantic is disgusting.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But yes, I think you have that engine in your head,</p>
<p>I guess, of creativity.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, the way you ask questions,</p>
<p>which is not trivial to do,</p>
<p>like for, it&rsquo;s actually very difficult to do,</p>
<p>like good survey questions.</p>
<p>And I mean, we&rsquo;re joking,</p>
<p>but like, yeah, almost like poetic</p>
<p>because you have to ask a question</p>
<p>in a way that doesn&rsquo;t lead to the answer.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Like you have to kind of inspire them to think</p>
<p>and then indirectly get at the truth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an art form, honestly.</p>
<p>Yeah, and also in a way</p>
<p>where they don&rsquo;t misinterpret the question</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s amazing how any question you think,</p>
<p>oh, this is the clearest question possible.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>It has to be even clearer.</p>
<p>Right, willingly or unwillingly,</p>
<p>because like you also have to defend</p>
<p>against that question being criticized later</p>
<p>when you publish about it, all of that.</p>
<p>You have to think about it all.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think this might be my greatest strength.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not very good at statistics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like great at presenting data,</p>
<p>but I think probably my greatest strength</p>
<p>is in fact survey design and like question phrasing.</p>
<p>Because I have tweeted so many thousands of polls</p>
<p>and every single one I get people telling me</p>
<p>the way that they misinterpreted the poll.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve become master. Gone through fire.</p>
<p>And then again, I&rsquo;m testing the phrasings all the time.</p>
<p>Like what happens if you slightly shift phrasings?</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ll do the same question test over time</p>
<p>to see how it changes</p>
<p>and the way the framing affects the results.</p>
<p>So the good and the bad of camming.</p>
<p>So you said good, the, what was it?</p>
<p>I forgot.</p>
<p>Your freedom.</p>
<p>The freedom.</p>
<p>The freedom to also be creative.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the bad is just that it was exhausting.</p>
<p>The site that I was on, the way that it&rsquo;s structured</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re ranking on the site</p>
<p>and thus the amount of people that see you</p>
<p>and thus the amount of money you earn</p>
<p>is affected by the amount of money that you earn</p>
<p>on average over the last 60 days.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re streaming and nobody&rsquo;s tipping you,</p>
<p>this means that you&rsquo;re going to be dropping</p>
<p>down in the rankings,</p>
<p>which is gonna make it harder in the future.</p>
<p>Okay, so the rich get richer on that site.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s very high pressure.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re on, you need to be making money</p>
<p>as fast as you can if you wanna continue to make money.</p>
<p>So that was really stressful.</p>
<p>It was very mentally taxing.</p>
<p>I would do it for a couple hours</p>
<p>and just log off and be completely exhausted</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re just like on as hard as you can.</p>
<p>And this is why I have a little PTSD around streaming.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve considered Twitch streaming</p>
<p>and I try a little bit and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t fully integrated the fact</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have to be like maximally entertaining</p>
<p>every single second yet.</p>
<p>You can actually just chill out and take it slow</p>
<p>and nothing bad happens.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You can just enjoy silence.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Did you feel lonely doing it?</p>
<p>I mean, even just streamers feel lonely.</p>
<p>I moved into a house of cam girls.</p>
<p>Did that make it better or worse?</p>
<p>It made it better.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still friends with them to this day.</p>
<p>Oh, so it was like a team almost like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in this kind of together?</p>
<p>Yeah, so we would like work together</p>
<p>and stream together and swap our clothes and stuff.</p>
<p>It was great.</p>
<p>Swap ideas too?</p>
<p>Swap ideas, yeah.</p>
<p>And actually on a small tangent, maybe a big tangent,</p>
<p>what do you think?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a recent controversy of Andrew Tate</p>
<p>and that he, I think in the past ran a camming business</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s being accused of sex trafficking.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Like from your own experience,</p>
<p>what do you understand about Andrew Tate?</p>
<p>Is he a good person?</p>
<p>Is he a bad person?</p>
<p>Is there something shady about his practices or not?</p>
<p>I wish I could answer, but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t looked into it at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard people talking about it.</p>
<p>I just haven&rsquo;t bothered to go into it.</p>
<p>It is well-known that like when I was doing it back in the day</p>
<p>that Eastern European models</p>
<p>had something different going on though.</p>
<p>It was like a trope about,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s the Eastern European models</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s everybody else.</p>
<p>That they&rsquo;re what, it&rsquo;s like darker or something like that?</p>
<p>Like they do studios and they&rsquo;re lower quality.</p>
<p>Which means what?</p>
<p>Studios are, you go into like a warehouse</p>
<p>and then they have set up a little,</p>
<p>like things that replicate bedrooms,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re just like stalls.</p>
<p>And then you give, you rent out</p>
<p>or you pay the studio percentage of your income.</p>
<p>And you can tell when something looks like a studio,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a type of background.</p>
<p>That if you&rsquo;re like watching enough,</p>
<p>it kind of starts to, you notice the patterns.</p>
<p>So like the standards are lower there</p>
<p>and the ethical boundaries are a little looser.</p>
<p>Of how people are treated.</p>
<p>I never heard anything about the ethical side.</p>
<p>I just knew that it was like lower quality.</p>
<p>Like the girls seemed like they were less into it</p>
<p>and like cared less.</p>
<p>How does this all interplay with like sex trafficking?</p>
<p>Consensual versus non-consensual.</p>
<p>I would be shocked if there were never</p>
<p>any non-consensual camming.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess it&rsquo;s like, if it were going to happen,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it were in fact,</p>
<p>Eastern European models.</p>
<p>Based on, this is outdated.</p>
<p>This is, I&rsquo;m just thinking of my stereotypes</p>
<p>back when I cammed a lot.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So some of that is stereotypes</p>
<p>versus like collecting good data, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I haven&rsquo;t done data on cam girl.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even hard to get that data, right?</p>
<p>But obviously a really important problem.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a method that I&rsquo;m trying that I really like.</p>
<p>I designed a survey type,</p>
<p>which is like asking people who you know.</p>
<p>Like, who do you know who&rsquo;s done this?</p>
<p>And you tell me like,</p>
<p>oh, do you know anybody who&rsquo;s a doctor?</p>
<p>Do you know anybody who has had cancer</p>
<p>or like smokes or?</p>
<p>Personally, you mean?</p>
<p>Yeah, personally.</p>
<p>Just do you know anybody?</p>
<p>And then if you ask about a whole bunch of things,</p>
<p>you can calibrate the responses.</p>
<p>So like-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>If your population, you know, 20% of them know doctors,</p>
<p>and then you know the actual amount of doctors,</p>
<p>then you can tell like how this is corresponding.</p>
<p>Like what is the visibility of doctors?</p>
<p>So you can reconstruct the graph.</p>
<p>Basically, yeah.</p>
<p>And we can do this with sex traffic.</p>
<p>And of course people are gonna be like,</p>
<p>well, sex traffic is not visible.</p>
<p>People, you don&rsquo;t know those.</p>
<p>Like, well, then we can ask about other non-visible things</p>
<p>that other people don&rsquo;t know that we do have data for.</p>
<p>Like homelessness or being in jail,</p>
<p>or like if you have been like sexually assaulted,</p>
<p>a lot of people don&rsquo;t like talking about</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;ve been sexually assaulted.</p>
<p>So you can do a whole bunch of things</p>
<p>that are like similarly suppressed in knowledge in some way</p>
<p>that we do actually have rates for.</p>
<p>And then compare that to the graph when we ask people,</p>
<p>do you know anybody who&rsquo;s in sex traffic?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So again, this is not perfect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying this is ideal.</p>
<p>But you can infer things.</p>
<p>You can infer things about that graph.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m saying we don&rsquo;t have good ways</p>
<p>of measuring sex trafficking right now.</p>
<p>Anyway, I did a big deep dive into the research</p>
<p>that we have on sex trafficking in the Western world.</p>
<p>And the actual, like I read the studies</p>
<p>and like reports about the studies,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really pitiful.</p>
<p>We have terrible data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s just like vague estimations</p>
<p>made from one guy in a basement in the 80s.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the basis for like one big study</p>
<p>that like a lot of people report on.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m like, okay.</p>
<p>So the method I&rsquo;m proposing obviously is not perfect,</p>
<p>but like the bar is so low at this point.</p>
<p>Well, I wonder also if there&rsquo;s ways to design a survey</p>
<p>that gets at the victims of sex trafficking also,</p>
<p>which is they presumably have public access to the internet.</p>
<p>And I wonder how many of them are distinctly aware</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re victims.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s asking the question</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re inside of a toxic relationship,</p>
<p>are you inside of a toxic relationship?</p>
<p>I mean, if the toxic relationship is truly toxic,</p>
<p>sometimes your mind is fucked with, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not, you don&rsquo;t even know what&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting if you can design surveys-</p>
<p>For people who are actively sex trafficked?</p>
<p>Yeah, who could break through that.</p>
<p>So basically get data on how many people</p>
<p>are getting sex trafficked directly.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Like if you don&rsquo;t frame it,</p>
<p>like if you don&rsquo;t say the word sex trafficking,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, are you just in a situation where you&rsquo;d-</p>
<p>And maybe through the survey, I mean, that&rsquo;s very meta,</p>
<p>but through the survey, help them.</p>
<p>You know, I did this,</p>
<p>this is what started my relationship surveys.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve done a series of relationship surveys,</p>
<p>and that was because I knew somebody</p>
<p>in a terrible relationship.</p>
<p>And I was like, I bet if she took a survey</p>
<p>where she answered questions about her relationship,</p>
<p>but at the end got a score</p>
<p>that compared her to everybody else,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;d be like, oh wait,</p>
<p>everybody else has much better relationships than I do.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I started making the relationship surveys,</p>
<p>was exactly for that reason.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s really, really, really powerful</p>
<p>to know that like you&rsquo;re not crazy</p>
<p>for thinking this is a bad relationship.</p>
<p>Right, or I think like the actual question is like,</p>
<p>could you do better if you broke up?</p>
<p>I think that the thing that keeps most people</p>
<p>in their relationships is like,</p>
<p>this is the best that I can do.</p>
<p>And like, this is normal.</p>
<p>And if it were normal, I would say that they are right.</p>
<p>Like if you live in a culture</p>
<p>where everybody is abusing their people</p>
<p>in their relationships, then yeah,</p>
<p>I mean, what are you going to do,</p>
<p>break up and then just be alone for the rest of your life?</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t want to do that.</p>
<p>But now comparing yourself to the average is good to know.</p>
<p>Know your options are.</p>
<p>At least understand it,</p>
<p>because being normal is not always,</p>
<p>like this conversation is not always great.</p>
<p>Meaning this conversation is anything but normal.</p>
<p>Okay, and that was a tangent on a tangent</p>
<p>about a niche passion, which is really fascinating</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re playing with those kinds of ideas</p>
<p>of survey design.</p>
<p>But back to camming.</p>
<p>So what were the cons?</p>
<p>What were the negatives of camming?</p>
<p>Oh, like the exhaustion of just like live,</p>
<p>like the high pressure thing.</p>
<p>That was probably the worst thing.</p>
<p>So not, was there,</p>
<p>what about the interaction with different people?</p>
<p>Like the dynamics of the interaction</p>
<p>with the fans, I guess.</p>
<p>I had a pretty great time.</p>
<p>I mean, it obviously wasn&rsquo;t perfect</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the internet, but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>This is the thing that confuses me a lot,</p>
<p>because a lot of women that I know</p>
<p>complain about being harassed by men quite a lot.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, you know, men are always,</p>
<p>you know, grow up in harass.</p>
<p>You know, you have to be paranoid in the club.</p>
<p>People are like, they&rsquo;re always huffing on you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just like, Jesus Christ, get away, man.</p>
<p>And I do not have this experience.</p>
<p>Or like, maybe I do, but I&rsquo;m interpreting it differently.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The thing is, I don&rsquo;t know what causes me</p>
<p>to have such a different experience from these women</p>
<p>that are like really, feel really hostile towards men.</p>
<p>And my guess is that there&rsquo;s some sort</p>
<p>of like very subtle signaling that we&rsquo;re accidentally doing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, no fault of our own.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying this is a virtue.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying like, maybe it&rsquo;s just genetic</p>
<p>or the fact that I&rsquo;m-</p>
<p>That women are doing?</p>
<p>That the women are doing, yeah.</p>
<p>Like that, and it might be just something</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m completely accidentally, through no intention,</p>
<p>like happening to signal the thing</p>
<p>that is causing men to not view me</p>
<p>as like a desirable target or like a target at all.</p>
<p>Well, what about the flip side?</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re not sensitive to the creepy stare.</p>
<p>Yeah, that also might be true.</p>
<p>The dude who&rsquo;s like, as I&rsquo;m dressing you with his eyes,</p>
<p>that like in a creepy way, that you&rsquo;re just not,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t like worry about it.</p>
<p>Or you&rsquo;re not touched, like the fear of that,</p>
<p>the anxiety of that, the unpleasantness of that</p>
<p>just doesn&rsquo;t hit you.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s also at least part of it.</p>
<p>Maybe all of it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think there&rsquo;s some evidence for it.</p>
<p>I think often like guys will do a thing to me</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just like, that&rsquo;s a thing, cool.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any negative response whatsoever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s call back to the tire.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a thing.</p>
<p>This is nice.</p>
<p>Yeah. That happened.</p>
<p>Was good to know that can happen.</p>
<p>Like I once had like a homeless guy</p>
<p>like asked me to come back to my place, baby.</p>
<p>And I was like, this is fun.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m like, do you want me to,</p>
<p>I love asking men like,</p>
<p>are you trying to get me to have sex with you?</p>
<p>Just like saying it out front.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll be like, well,</p>
<p>they usually they stop for a minute and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>well, yeah, I mean, I would like to have sex.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll be like, thanks for asking,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not interested in having sex with you.</p>
<p>How do you have a good day?</p>
<p>And then I walk away and that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I have no issues with that interaction,</p>
<p>but like maybe this is the kind of thing</p>
<p>that other women would find to be really offensive.</p>
<p>So you have that conversation</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t turn into like a threatening feel.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Like with a homeless guy.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ve never had that happen though.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s just something,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m doing something.</p>
<p>Like, again, this is kind of accidental.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m just am like this always.</p>
<p>And I think I just happen to be like this at people</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t expect it.</p>
<p>Like they don&rsquo;t expect me to be like really nice</p>
<p>while explicitly asking them what their intentions are.</p>
<p>Like directly putting my finger on the thing that like,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;re trying to have sex with me.</p>
<p>And then also not judging them for it.</p>
<p>I think this like throws people off a little bit</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t get aggressive.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh, you&rsquo;re autistic or something.</p>
<p>Even the cloak of anonymity on the internet,</p>
<p>you weren&rsquo;t getting.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just think I&rsquo;m just not reactive</p>
<p>and or maybe I&rsquo;m giving off, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s both, maybe it&rsquo;s a feedback loop.</p>
<p>So I just, I had a pretty good experience.</p>
<p>I know not everybody did.</p>
<p>Definitely people reported having antagonistic experiences.</p>
<p>But when I was scamming, I generally really liked,</p>
<p>people were really nice to me, had a great time,</p>
<p>made friends.</p>
<p>So you also did OnlyFans, as you mentioned.</p>
<p>And I read on a website,</p>
<p>so this is very investigative reporting,</p>
<p>that on some months you&rsquo;ve made over $100,000 on OnlyFans.</p>
<p>How did that feel?</p>
<p>Great, really great.</p>
<p>I mean, like, well, actually,</p>
<p>because so much of your upbringing, you didn&rsquo;t have money.</p>
<p>You had to struggle with the fact of your job and so on.</p>
<p>Maybe a good person to ask, can money buy happiness?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think you get like a resting set point</p>
<p>of happiness, regardless of how much money you have.</p>
<p>But money can buy being less stressed, I would say.</p>
<p>Is there a lot of variation</p>
<p>in the basic rest happiness for humans in general?</p>
<p>Like, is that a good thing to think about?</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;ve done some studies, but again,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t actually read the studies,</p>
<p>so maybe they didn&rsquo;t replicate,</p>
<p>where they measured people before and after</p>
<p>winning a bunch of money</p>
<p>to see if their happiness was higher.</p>
<p>I think by some measures it was, and by some it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>No, I mean, basically, almost genetically.</p>
<p>So nature and nurture, but is there,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say after you&rsquo;re 18,</p>
<p>is there like some stable level of happiness</p>
<p>that all the environmental genetic factors combine</p>
<p>to create so that everything that life throws at you</p>
<p>has to face that happiness?</p>
<p>Like you mentioned earlier that I seem to be happy</p>
<p>with a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>So maybe I have a certain level.</p>
<p>Do other people have a lower level?</p>
<p>Some people have higher level.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>Is that a useful, or is that a useful model of human beings?</p>
<p>Or is it all ups and downs?</p>
<p>Like, is it all, like, there&rsquo;s no stable.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, that&rsquo;s my combo, right?</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Some people just are happier than others in general,</p>
<p>and other people aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But then you also have ups and downs.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve experienced sadness sometimes</p>
<p>and happiness the other times.</p>
<p>Like, if I actually were to integrate,</p>
<p>so have an integral under the,</p>
<p>the area under the curve,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m different than other people.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m just like really focused on the happy moments</p>
<p>and maybe feel the down moments most intensely,</p>
<p>and maybe that, like, on average, it&rsquo;s all the same.</p>
<p>Is that possible?</p>
<p>I mean, maybe?</p>
<p>I just, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Like, I remember when I was a kid,</p>
<p>my mom would call me Pollyanna all the time.</p>
<p>So I was, like, finding the good in everything.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like, something bad would happen.</p>
<p>So you were a happy kid?</p>
<p>I was a really happy kid, yeah.</p>
<p>Even in the harsh conditions?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, like I said,</p>
<p>like, I think the harshness comes from the bad meaning.</p>
<p>Like, and I had good meaning applied to it.</p>
<p>You were a stoic.</p>
<p>I was, yeah.</p>
<p>With another book I&rsquo;m reading next week,</p>
<p>tune in, Marcus Aurelius, Meditations.</p>
<p>All right, all right,</p>
<p>camming, 100K, so it felt good.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s crazy, though, right?</p>
<p>You can just, like, take clothes off</p>
<p>in a creative way with some gnomes and make 100,000?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there was a lot more to it than that,</p>
<p>but yeah.</p>
<p>What was it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the different process?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s marketing.</p>
<p>Like, so with only, with my free cams,</p>
<p>I was unusual in that I decided to do,</p>
<p>outside of the website marketing,</p>
<p>I would, like, post on Reddit, right?</p>
<p>This was very unusual at the time,</p>
<p>but, like, OnlyFans is structured such that</p>
<p>they have almost no internal discovery whatsoever.</p>
<p>So if you want people to come to your page,</p>
<p>you have to go out onto external websites</p>
<p>and advertise for yourself directly.</p>
<p>Very different model.</p>
<p>And so this is something I had already been doing</p>
<p>and already had practiced in,</p>
<p>and so I think I was, like, already quite advanced.</p>
<p>Like, I already had an account on Reddit</p>
<p>that was, like, seven years old at the time,</p>
<p>tons of, like, karma that means</p>
<p>I could post in subreddits.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d already been on Twitter for years,</p>
<p>you know, like, posting actively.</p>
<p>So I already had, like, presences</p>
<p>on all these other platforms</p>
<p>that really helped with the conversion.</p>
<p>Reddit and Twitter?</p>
<p>Reddit, Twitter, FetLife, Instagram, TikTok.</p>
<p>And you were still advertising creatively?</p>
<p>So, like, there&rsquo;s, like, sexuality,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also, like, creative sexuality.</p>
<p>Yeah. And ideas, too.</p>
<p>Yeah, like, one of the really popular ones</p>
<p>was I, like, molested myself as a mime</p>
<p>using a, one arm through a jacket.</p>
<p>And so the jacket looked like it was,</p>
<p>the jacket looked like it was alive,</p>
<p>and, you know, and that one did really well.</p>
<p>Did you, like, brainstorm with somebody?</p>
<p>And, like, I recently got to hang out with Mr. Beast</p>
<p>and sit on a session of brainstorming different ideas.</p>
<p>I just envision you with, like, a team brainstorming.</p>
<p>All right, how about we try the mime</p>
<p>and the molesting thing?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s too edgy.</p>
<p>I wish, I think the team would have been a lot more fun.</p>
<p>But no, it was just me.</p>
<p>Like, I had an apartment that looked, like,</p>
<p>kind of like this, you know?</p>
<p>You just sit alone, and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>well, that would be a good idea.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d seen, you just collect ideas over time, right?</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;d seen somebody doing a version</p>
<p>of the, like, this animated hand act, like, when I was a kid.</p>
<p>And it just always stuck in my head.</p>
<p>And, like, one day I was like, I bet I could do that.</p>
<p>And then when I was, didn&rsquo;t try and think of ideas to do</p>
<p>as a sex worker, I was like, why don&rsquo;t I just try that?</p>
<p>And then it turned out to be, like,</p>
<p>like a really, like, quite a viral hit.</p>
<p>Is there, is there stuff, like you mentioned, too edgy?</p>
<p>Like, Mr. Beast tries to keep it PG.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you try to keep it PG-13?</p>
<p>Well, with the sex advertising stuff,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s sex advertising, so it&rsquo;s obviously not PG-13.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know these ratings.</p>
<p>What is even beyond that, R? It&rsquo;s not family-friendly.</p>
<p>It is X.</p>
<p>Like, even the one that I&rsquo;m describing to you,</p>
<p>at some point, like, you can see my boob.</p>
<p>So. There&rsquo;s a boob, is X.</p>
<p>A boob is, I guess.</p>
<p>I thought R, I think you could show a boob in PG-13.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe X is, like, if you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>some sort of rhythmic motion going on.</p>
<p>Maybe that sound, but the rhythmic motion, not.</p>
<p>You can have one or the other, but you can&rsquo;t have both.</p>
<p>You have both.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when we hit the X, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, definitely not family.</p>
<p>I mean, with the sex advertising stuff,</p>
<p>like, guys like vanilla shit.</p>
<p>Guys want basic, hot girl.</p>
<p>You can do something, like, kind of sexy and creative,</p>
<p>like getting abducted by gnomes,</p>
<p>or, like, the self-molestation, right?</p>
<p>But those are still pretty within the normal boundaries.</p>
<p>What do you mean, guys like vanilla stuff?</p>
<p>I mean, most guys like vanilla stuff.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s vanilla stuff?</p>
<p>Like, hot girl being horny.</p>
<p>See, we&rsquo;ll talk about fetish.</p>
<p>Fetishes.</p>
<p>I think my Overton window on what is vanilla</p>
<p>is expanding quickly after following your work.</p>
<p>But, yeah.</p>
<p>I actually have done a lot of studies on what is vanilla.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;ve done a couple different surveys</p>
<p>where I ask people, like, how taboo is this thing?</p>
<p>And I have, like, a rating from least to most taboo.</p>
<p>By the way, I don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t appreciate the beauty of vanilla ice cream.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>It is really good, though.</p>
<p>You eat vanilla ice cream?</p>
<p>I eat vanilla ice cream, yeah.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s just so many more options.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, like, the absence of creativity.</p>
<p>I mean, if you put in, like,</p>
<p>some chocolate chips or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, they already made it more interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a start.</p>
<p>Okay, so what&rsquo;s vanilla?</p>
<p>And why do guys like vanilla?</p>
<p>So, hot girl doing hot girl things?</p>
<p>What, like, on dressing and then having sex?</p>
<p>The thing that I found was most successful</p>
<p>were frames where the man was framed as passive</p>
<p>and the woman as active.</p>
<p>Or, like, for example, like, oh, you know,</p>
<p>we got assigned to the same bunk</p>
<p>at the breeding school or something.</p>
<p>Or, like, oh, we&rsquo;re the last people on Earth, right?</p>
<p>Or, like, oh, no, you know,</p>
<p>I desperately need somebody to, like,</p>
<p>cure me with this disease and I need semen.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, like, in any scenario</p>
<p>where the guy just, like, finds himself</p>
<p>such that the woman, like, desperately needs him</p>
<p>for some reason and he doesn&rsquo;t have to do much,</p>
<p>that is, like, typically one of the</p>
<p>much more successful things.</p>
<p>Guys like women falling into their lap.</p>
<p>What about the power dynamic?</p>
<p>So guys are less into power dynamics than women are.</p>
<p>And you can do power dynamics</p>
<p>as long as it&rsquo;s, like, handed to them.</p>
<p>Some guys, obviously, some guys are, like,</p>
<p>very dominant and, like, prefer, like, having to work.</p>
<p>But this is the minority.</p>
<p>Like, if you&rsquo;re trying to do, make 100K a month</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to appeal to the widest group of people,</p>
<p>the most effective advertising,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna be making the most money</p>
<p>by being, like, particularly submissive.</p>
<p>So on the camming side, that&rsquo;s your,</p>
<p>unlike, like, escorting or just personal relationships,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to, you have an audience.</p>
<p>You have, like, a theater full of people.</p>
<p>Like with live camming?</p>
<p>Yeah, with live camming.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like a live theater.</p>
<p>Does that freak you out?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just, like, a bunch of people watching?</p>
<p>How do you feel right now?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re watching, because it&rsquo;s not live.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true, it&rsquo;s not live.</p>
<p>So, like, it might as well be.</p>
<p>Like, they could be watching.</p>
<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s just the two of us.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, like, sometimes I imagine</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a third person.</p>
<p>Like God?</p>
<p>Usually, no, no, not God, just,</p>
<p>I usually imagine either a guy or girl or a couple</p>
<p>just sitting there for some reason,</p>
<p>like, usually on the beach and usually high,</p>
<p>or on some kind of, like, on mushrooms,</p>
<p>just, like, listening passively,</p>
<p>just kind of looking at the sunset.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I imagine.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>Like, when I write my blog posts,</p>
<p>sometimes I do terribly, but it&rsquo;s the most effective</p>
<p>when I imagine one person that I&rsquo;m writing to</p>
<p>to try to explain.</p>
<p>And, like, having a high couple watching the sunset</p>
<p>is maybe really lovely as a calibration.</p>
<p>I have to say, it is pretty romantic,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to meet couples</p>
<p>that listen to podcasts together.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why,</p>
<p>that seems, like, intensely romantic to me,</p>
<p>because, like,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not watching TV together,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re listening to a thing.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess sometimes they watch it,</p>
<p>but, like, you&rsquo;re listening to ideas together.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re going through the same</p>
<p>kind of thought process at the same time.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really beautiful way to put it.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re melding,</p>
<p>your thinking is following the same line.</p>
<p>Some of our podcasts do that more than movies.</p>
<p>I think movies give you a lot more freedom</p>
<p>to think about stuff.</p>
<p>I feel like your thoughts are aligned.</p>
<p>And, like, especially if the podcast is good,</p>
<p>like, if it&rsquo;s listening to, like, a Dan Carlin podcast</p>
<p>about history, that you&rsquo;re, like, on a journey together.</p>
<p>Eh, there&rsquo;s an intimacy to that.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve learned that couples do that, you know?</p>
<p>Hashtag relationship ghosts.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you want with your future wife?</p>
<p>With my, yeah.</p>
<p>You should make an application.</p>
<p>Application?</p>
<p>An application for dating you.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe this is more of, like, my strategy</p>
<p>and less yours, but you have, like,</p>
<p>a wide enough audience that might work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s just go there.</p>
<p>So, because you&rsquo;ve put together an application</p>
<p>of, like, people to have casual sex with you,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve had that.</p>
<p>And also dating, yeah.</p>
<p>And also dating and relationship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to&hellip;</p>
<p>So, what is in that application?</p>
<p>Because, like, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s quite a lot of people</p>
<p>that would like to date you or to sleep with you,</p>
<p>but finding the person&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, it depends what your goal is.</p>
<p>I guess relationship would be an open relationship for you?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like, for me, I guess it&rsquo;s more intensely selective</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, like, a monogamous relationship</p>
<p>and a committed one.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m swinging for the&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>For, like, long-term.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, like, weirdly obsessed with long-term,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, like, I would love to have one girl</p>
<p>for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>But finding that,</p>
<p>I feel like applications will not get to that.</p>
<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s some aspect of the magic</p>
<p>of the serendipity of it,</p>
<p>of meeting people in strange places and so on.</p>
<p>I just, I personally have noticed that, like,</p>
<p>fame has not made that process easier.</p>
<p>But, I mean, like, if you could, you know,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s two rooms and one of them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, like, a random population of hot women</p>
<p>and the other one is a random population of hot women,</p>
<p>but all of them definitely are monogamous</p>
<p>and are looking for a long-term committed relationship,</p>
<p>like, which room would you rather go into?</p>
<p>Like, if you&rsquo;re looking for a mate.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, but see, I guess my preferences are more&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really strong point.</p>
<p>But my preferences represent the majority, probably, right?</p>
<p>Because don&rsquo;t most women want monogamous relationships?</p>
<p>So, like, it&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m okay with either option.</p>
<p>Because, like, statistically speaking.</p>
<p>But I feel like we can apply it</p>
<p>to, like, a bunch of other things.</p>
<p>Yeah, and this is just a problem</p>
<p>if you have a high volume to filter through</p>
<p>and you, like, you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s a good, like, initial filter.</p>
<p>Like, you can take it from, like, a thousand people</p>
<p>to 20 people and then go on dates with them.</p>
<p>But the filter is so anti-romantic.</p>
<p>Like, what?</p>
<p>This is true.</p>
<p>This is not the romantic narrative</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re very prone to.</p>
<p>I feel like, how did you two meet?</p>
<p>Well, she passed the three filters I set up.</p>
<p>And, I mean, but it&rsquo;s also,</p>
<p>but also, can you put into a survey</p>
<p>the things that you&rsquo;re interested in?</p>
<p>I mean, I definitely think about this a lot with hiring.</p>
<p>Like, teams, engineers, and so on.</p>
<p>But with engineers,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re okay losing truly special engineers</p>
<p>because you have to filter</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s, like, thousands of applications.</p>
<p>Like, it feels like,</p>
<p>it feels like I worry that you would miss</p>
<p>the thing that actually,</p>
<p>because so much of it is chemistry.</p>
<p>So much of it is, like, the magic, you know?</p>
<p>But the thing is, you&rsquo;re missing it anyway.</p>
<p>Like-</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re missing it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, oh, you can just run it.</p>
<p>And then, in addition, try some of those people.</p>
<p>And then go on the dates that you were going to go on</p>
<p>with anyway, regardless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the thing that helps, like,</p>
<p>pull someone out of the crowd.</p>
<p>Like this, I dated a guy from my survey.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d ran the survey.</p>
<p>I assigned point values to each of the questions.</p>
<p>I went on a date with, like, the top couple people.</p>
<p>And then one of them, I was like,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m still dating him to this day.</p>
<p>And it was awesome.</p>
<p>And I would never,</p>
<p>I never would have gone on a date with him</p>
<p>without the survey.</p>
<p>Can you, if from memory, or we can look it up,</p>
<p>do you remember what kind of questions were on the survey?</p>
<p>I asked a couple different categories.</p>
<p>I asked about, like, basic life stuff.</p>
<p>So, like, what kind of relationships,</p>
<p>like, monogamy versus polyamory.</p>
<p>Like, do you want kids?</p>
<p>You know, like, where you want to live.</p>
<p>Like, basic things that you need to be compatible.</p>
<p>And then I asked, like, sexual compatibility,</p>
<p>like, various preferences.</p>
<p>And then I had a section about, like, personality.</p>
<p>Like, what are,</p>
<p>I try to ask questions</p>
<p>that would do the most effective filtering.</p>
<p>So, like, what are ways that, like,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t give people what they need</p>
<p>that, like, maybe they really want?</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t really, I&rsquo;m not very outdoorsy.</p>
<p>It was just very common.</p>
<p>A lot of people like being outdoorsy.</p>
<p>So, I asked the question, like,</p>
<p>how much do you value someone else</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re dating being outdoorsy?</p>
<p>If they marked yes, I was like, okay, we probably,</p>
<p>I should probably downgrade the results.</p>
<p>But what if, man,</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t polyamory make that really difficult?</p>
<p>Because can&rsquo;t they find somebody for the outdoorsy stuff?</p>
<p>Yeah, they could.</p>
<p>I mean, this isn&rsquo;t, like,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re going to have somebody,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, like, nicer to have them</p>
<p>be more compatible than less.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re a little bit, like,</p>
<p>in terms of sexual compatibility,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to, like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re self-aware enough to know</p>
<p>what preferences you have.</p>
<p>Like, you can.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I think that one helped a lot with the escorting.</p>
<p>Like, the escorting helped a lot</p>
<p>with knowing my preferences.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s, like,</p>
<p>out of the giant pool of different preferences,</p>
<p>you have, like, a subset that&rsquo;s clearly defined for you?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Like, dominant-submissive.</p>
<p>Yeah, power dynamic stuff.</p>
<p>Power dynamic stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And not just sexual, but in relationship, too.</p>
<p>Like, was that in the survey?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like power dynamics in relationships.</p>
<p>I did ask-</p>
<p>No, defining them in,</p>
<p>like, making it clear in a survey.</p>
<p>Like, asking a question about power dynamics</p>
<p>in a relationship.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I asked about power dynamics</p>
<p>in relationships.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Because I just assume most people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of things that are kind of, like-</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re putting together a survey,</p>
<p>a systematic survey to understand compatibility.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t power dynamics inside of relationships</p>
<p>that naturally emerge often be part of the question?</p>
<p>Or is that hard to question</p>
<p>because it naturally emerges and you can&rsquo;t-</p>
<p>Well, the thing is, like,</p>
<p>a lot of questions sort of overlap in demographic.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re making a survey,</p>
<p>you want to have the minimum possible questions</p>
<p>that give the maximum possible, like,</p>
<p>filtering information.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.</p>
<p>But the purpose of that survey</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t to do a good research study.</p>
<p>It was to select one subject that you could take.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s part of what is good.</p>
<p>Like, you want to most efficiently filter out.</p>
<p>Because, one, like, you get more people taking the survey</p>
<p>the fewer questions you have,</p>
<p>which is good for finding a mate.</p>
<p>Like, if you have 5,000 men take the survey,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s better than 1,000 men take it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you want men that would be patient enough</p>
<p>and dedicated enough to fill it up?</p>
<p>Yeah, but, like, what if you want, like,</p>
<p>a high-powered man who&rsquo;s, like, on his lunch break, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like-</p>
<p>Like a billionaire who&rsquo;s too busy</p>
<p>just flipping through. Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the guy that I dated, he took the survey,</p>
<p>he was waiting for the pizza to come out of the oven.</p>
<p>And so it was important that it was short.</p>
<p>And so you want to be efficient.</p>
<p>Is it metaphor or literally pizza coming out of the oven?</p>
<p>He was literally waiting for pizza.</p>
<p>And he saw, the thing is, like,</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;ll just fill out the survey really fast</p>
<p>and it changed our lives.</p>
<p>So romantic.</p>
<p>For me, this is my kind of romance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really into it.</p>
<p>But you could be efficient with surveys</p>
<p>by, like, making sure your questions don&rsquo;t overlap.</p>
<p>So, for example, if somebody is very polyamorous,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very unlikely to be interested</p>
<p>in, like, a traditional, like, man works</p>
<p>and the job and the woman stays home</p>
<p>and raises the kids kind of relationship.</p>
<p>Because poly people just generally don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>And so if I&rsquo;m asking about polyamory,</p>
<p>it sort of kind of already covers the thing.</p>
<p>And so if I have a whole bunch of questions,</p>
<p>like, I can kind of, like, triangulate</p>
<p>a bunch of implicit kinds of questions</p>
<p>that I haven&rsquo;t directly asked about.</p>
<p>So this is why I didn&rsquo;t ask directly about power dynamics,</p>
<p>because, like, from the rest of the questions</p>
<p>that are in my survey, like, I can pretty accurately</p>
<p>predict whether or not you&rsquo;re gonna be interested</p>
<p>in power dynamics.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m afraid, yeah, like, I&rsquo;m trying to think</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re talking, I get it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting that you did that.</p>
<p>Also, maybe not for the effectiveness</p>
<p>of finding a partner, but for just exploring</p>
<p>the actual, the process of human sexuality,</p>
<p>of, like, the search, this complicated optimization process</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all engaging in on the landscape of happiness</p>
<p>that seems to be this, not even a differentiable function.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a giant nonlinear mess.</p>
<p>Okay, but, like, for me, I don&rsquo;t think I would be able</p>
<p>to design that survey.</p>
<p>I would, like, bias it too strongly.</p>
<p>Like, I would probably prefer women</p>
<p>that have read Dostoevsky or something like that.</p>
<p>Like, that would be a filter for me, right?</p>
<p>But, like, that&rsquo;s a horrible filter.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a lot of, like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of amazing people that have never,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t give a shit about reading,</p>
<p>or they don&rsquo;t give a shit about reading Russian literature,</p>
<p>or they don&rsquo;t give a shit about,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re amazing and passionate and creative</p>
<p>in some other dimension that you might completely miss.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re, like, I wonder if there&rsquo;s any,</p>
<p>basically, you&rsquo;re saying compatibility, like, hard lines</p>
<p>that you know statistically is just going to be an issue.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you weight this a lot more.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also, like, preferences.</p>
<p>Like, if you have a woman who&rsquo;s totally equal</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s read the thing that you like,</p>
<p>versus another woman who&rsquo;s also identical,</p>
<p>but, like, she hasn&rsquo;t read the thing that you like,</p>
<p>like, you probably, like,</p>
<p>very slightly prefer the one that has.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re identical, yes, yes.</p>
<p>But, like, you can&rsquo;t, through survey, get the identical.</p>
<p>Like, you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Sure, but you can kind of, like,</p>
<p>do a whole bunch of weights.</p>
<p>So, like, the person that, like,</p>
<p>I ended up going on a date with,</p>
<p>he did not answer, like, correctly</p>
<p>to a lot of the survey questions, but he didn&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>Like, he was just overall, overall,</p>
<p>the weights were, like,</p>
<p>he just tended to be more in the direction.</p>
<p>Was there a text-based fill-in, like, survey?</p>
<p>But, like, sorry, paragraph, like?</p>
<p>No, you ought to avoid that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re dealing with, like, large amounts of data.</p>
<p>No, why not?</p>
<p>Because you have to fill, oh, oh, interesting.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m different.</p>
<p>Because, like, first of all, you can do keyword searches.</p>
<p>Second of all, you can do machine learning models</p>
<p>that, like, first of all, you can do,</p>
<p>you can do, like, crude metrics,</p>
<p>like the length of how long they&rsquo;ve written, right?</p>
<p>And it could flag certain things.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s actually pretty easy to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked at, like, for hiring,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked at, like, thousands of applications</p>
<p>really quickly.</p>
<p>Like, you can really,</p>
<p>the human brain is really interesting,</p>
<p>especially, like, if you visually highlight</p>
<p>certain information for yourself, like,</p>
<p>keywords or, again, with machine learning models,</p>
<p>like sentiment, you can highlight different parts</p>
<p>that will catch your eye better than not.</p>
<p>And I can go through just a huge number of applications.</p>
<p>Are you telling me I can use,</p>
<p>if I learn machine learning,</p>
<p>I can process dating survey applications better?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>No, like, textual.</p>
<p>Yeah, like, I can, like, have them write things in.</p>
<p>Like, this is, like, a new way of,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really good incentive.</p>
<p>I think that would,</p>
<p>so the really nice aspect of text input,</p>
<p>like long-form text input,</p>
<p>multiple long-form text input</p>
<p>based on an interestingly phrased question</p>
<p>is you get to learn how to make a better survey.</p>
<p>I think you would appreciate that.</p>
<p>Like, you start to see how they&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>interacting with these questions.</p>
<p>Like, I ask certain questions,</p>
<p>like, just to see how people think.</p>
<p>Is it better to work smart or better to work hard?</p>
<p>Or is it ever okay to betray a close friend?</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;ll ask, like, questions like this</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t really have a right answer,</p>
<p>but I just wanna see how they think.</p>
<p>Or is truth more important than loyalty?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I get their long-form answer.</p>
<p>And you get to see their reasoning process.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Like, it reveals so much,</p>
<p>not just about the person,</p>
<p>but about the kind of questions I should be asking</p>
<p>that have nothing to do with truth or loyalty.</p>
<p>Like, how to get a good engineer</p>
<p>with, like, very specific questions.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s really useful to get text input.</p>
<p>I have done text input usually with beta surveys.</p>
<p>So I usually do beta surveys before I do the real survey.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a beta survey?</p>
<p>Like, I do, like, a shorter version,</p>
<p>or it depends on what I&rsquo;m doing,</p>
<p>but, like, a different version of the survey</p>
<p>that I have people take before I release.</p>
<p>I use the information from the initial survey</p>
<p>to inform the questions that I ask in the real survey.</p>
<p>And I haven&rsquo;t actually, recently,</p>
<p>but I used to do a lot of, like, the text-based questions</p>
<p>to see if they&rsquo;re similar.</p>
<p>Although I don&rsquo;t think I relied on it quite as heavily.</p>
<p>And if I introduced machine learning,</p>
<p>I think it would be a lot more efficient.</p>
<p>I love that you&rsquo;re also doing, like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re writing scripts and stuff.</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re doing some, like, statistical analysis.</p>
<p>Are you using Python mostly?</p>
<p>Yeah, I had to learn Python for this</p>
<p>just a couple months ago.</p>
<p>Which is the best way to learn Python.</p>
<p>And the best reason to learn machine learning</p>
<p>is to solve actual, like, problems.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can&rsquo;t be motivated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not motivated to learn something</p>
<p>unless there&rsquo;s an actual curiosity I have,</p>
<p>and I have to learn it and to solve it.</p>
<p>I was trying to avoid learning coding for so long,</p>
<p>but eventually it was my data set became too large.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t work with it with anything else.</p>
<p>So, oh, Python it is.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s also an interesting data set</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re probably interested in a little bit</p>
<p>is, like, Twitter itself, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played with the Twitter API a lot.</p>
<p>Can you just get the, download the,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just, I&rsquo;m stuttering now because the-</p>
<p>Download the Twitter?</p>
<p>Can you download Twitter?</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s a lot of Twitter.</p>
<p>So, Twitter&rsquo;s a social network with a bunch of people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re interacting a lot.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know, the number&rsquo;s insane,</p>
<p>the number of interactions.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s different ways to interact,</p>
<p>to get data from Twitter.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s streams, you can look at,</p>
<p>depends what you&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<p>You can do results for searches.</p>
<p>You can look at individual tweets and get entire,</p>
<p>which to me is super interesting,</p>
<p>the entire tree of different conversations, the replies,</p>
<p>which might be very interesting for you</p>
<p>because, like, it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much harder to ask rigorous questions,</p>
<p>which you do with your polls.</p>
<p>But you can see, like, how divisive certain things are.</p>
<p>You can look at sentiment.</p>
<p>Like calibrators to figure out, like,</p>
<p>exactly what questions you should be asking.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And also highlight interesting anecdotal things,</p>
<p>where, like, two people freak out at each other</p>
<p>and just argue, like, a thread that goes on</p>
<p>for, like, a thousand messages</p>
<p>that you might never be even aware is happening</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re, like,</p>
<p>because Twitter doesn&rsquo;t, like, surface that.</p>
<p>Like, it would be,</p>
<p>Twitter doesn&rsquo;t make it easy for you to, like,</p>
<p>visualize what the hell&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>even with your own social network.</p>
<p>Like, if you post something that&rsquo;s controversial,</p>
<p>that gets a large amount of attention,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t clearly visualize everything that&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, it&rsquo;s blurry, amorphous.</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re just kind of looking through the fog</p>
<p>at different replies, and it kind of, it&rsquo;s, yeah.</p>
<p>So to be able to-</p>
<p>Do you see with the API,</p>
<p>they have, like, graphs of networks?</p>
<p>They have the data for the graphs, yeah.</p>
<p>So you can reconstruct it yourself.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then you have different levels of access</p>
<p>in terms of how many queries you can do.</p>
<p>That is really cool.</p>
<p>And now, because there&rsquo;s, like, Elon,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of sort of revolutionary stuff</p>
<p>happening at Twitter, I think.</p>
<p>You could literally sort of push for innovation there.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s aggressive innovation happening.</p>
<p>So in terms of requesting stuff for the API,</p>
<p>you could do all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I think Twitter is just a fascinating platform</p>
<p>for the, as cliche as it sounds, for studying.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>what makes for a healthy conversation.</p>
<p>That term has been used,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s interesting how conversation,</p>
<p>to me, it&rsquo;s fascinating how conversations break down</p>
<p>and not.</p>
<p>Like, how, like, the virality of drama</p>
<p>or conflict or disagreement,</p>
<p>how that evolves when a large number of people are involved,</p>
<p>when a large number of misinterpretation</p>
<p>of statements is involved in text-based,</p>
<p>with some anonymity thrown in.</p>
<p>Like, I feel like there&rsquo;s a lot of study</p>
<p>that can be done there.</p>
<p>I mean, Twitter&rsquo;s probably not great at it, right,</p>
<p>as it stands.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s, like, necessarily short.</p>
<p>You can quote-treat things out of context, et cetera.</p>
<p>But we should understand that, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>At a scale, at a large scale,</p>
<p>you should be able to study that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Which, oh yeah, what was your casual sex survey?</p>
<p>I actually haven&rsquo;t looked at it in a while.</p>
<p>I think, I just asked people</p>
<p>about a whole bunch of fetishes,</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t want to be obvious about yours</p>
<p>because then people are going to hijack it</p>
<p>to try to tell you that they like what you like.</p>
<p>Ah, sure.</p>
<p>So you want to be obscure.</p>
<p>You want to design a survey</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re testing for a thing,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re still obscure</p>
<p>about the thing you&rsquo;re trying to ask about.</p>
<p>So you still see it as a survey?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Like an application?</p>
<p>Because I think you tweeted saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of just showing up to San Francisco</p>
<p>and saying, is anybody open for casual sex?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Something like this?</p>
<p>Am I misremembering?</p>
<p>Maybe escorting?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Oh, for escorting.</p>
<p>Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.</p>
<p>Which is similar.</p>
<p>Like, I kind of use escorting</p>
<p>as the way to have casual sex now.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about escorting.</p>
<p>So you wrote about escorting in your blog post.</p>
<p>Escorting was good for me.</p>
<p>How did you get into escorting?</p>
<p>I was working at like a,</p>
<p>I quit camming because I was burned out</p>
<p>and I was like trying to work at a friend&rsquo;s startup</p>
<p>and it was hard for me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s difficult for me to work on projects</p>
<p>that are not my projects.</p>
<p>And so I was like, hey, fuck it.</p>
<p>Like, I want to go back to sex work.</p>
<p>I want to make more money,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t want to cam anymore</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m burned out.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, well, let&rsquo;s try.</p>
<p>I had a friend who was an escort.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, let&rsquo;s try that.</p>
<p>And so we had a call.</p>
<p>She like outlined the basics for me</p>
<p>and then I put up some ads and then started working.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the basics of escorting?</p>
<p>How does that work?</p>
<p>The basic, if you want to get started escorting,</p>
<p>so just in case you have a career change.</p>
<p>I would like to.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re going to want to get some nice photos.</p>
<p>So you probably have those.</p>
<p>First of all, you assumed I haven&rsquo;t done it before.</p>
<p>How rude.</p>
<p>Have you?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you know,</p>
<p>recreation I would like to do professionally, I suppose.</p>
<p>So if I wanted to do it,</p>
<p>if I really wanted to step up my game,</p>
<p>how would I do it?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you got the whole tutorial.</p>
<p>Recreational escorting is just, okay, okay.</p>
<p>No, meaning like, you know,</p>
<p>like selling products on Etsy versus doing a startup.</p>
<p>Well, I mean,</p>
<p>escorting is kind of all just selling products on Etsy.</p>
<p>No, but selling a lot of products on Etsy.</p>
<p>Like high volume.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve like dabbled.</p>
<p>Yeah, like, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Small handcrafted artisan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the small handcrafted dolls.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Escorting.</p>
<p>Versus mass manufacturer.</p>
<p>Okay, if you want a mass manufacturer, you&rsquo;re escorting.</p>
<p>I just feel like I haven&rsquo;t been getting, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been undervaluing my services</p>
<p>and I would like to really step up.</p>
<p>I think you could really just like</p>
<p>grease some marketing gears and be trustworthy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s just some of this is marketing.</p>
<p>So like how, I guess I want to like know,</p>
<p>is it similar to camming in that way?</p>
<p>Like, is it you&rsquo;re basically advertising yourself</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re marketing all the creativity</p>
<p>that you mentioned before, all of that?</p>
<p>Yeah, I found escorting to be pretty easy</p>
<p>because escorting is not like highly competitive.</p>
<p>For example, camming is highly competitive</p>
<p>because like the thing that I outlined before,</p>
<p>you know, the amount of money that you make</p>
<p>determines your ranking.</p>
<p>And you can also go and see other girls.</p>
<p>You can see what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So if a girl figures out an incredible strategy</p>
<p>for making money, it&rsquo;s like two seconds</p>
<p>before that strategy proliferates into everybody else.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very fast paced and like really tough.</p>
<p>With escorting, you don&rsquo;t get to see</p>
<p>what other girls are doing.</p>
<p>You can look at their websites,</p>
<p>but like you don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>with clients at all.</p>
<p>You can look at their rates,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know what their volume is.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t actually know what is successful</p>
<p>and what isn&rsquo;t very much.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s much less like evolution of marketing</p>
<p>through this process.</p>
<p>And so I came in with like my aggressive marketing skills</p>
<p>for being a cam girl.</p>
<p>I think that really helped.</p>
<p>I did very well as an escort.</p>
<p>I just came in like made a fantastic website</p>
<p>and I knew how to do the ads right.</p>
<p>What was the finding people?</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s also like finding the right kind of customer</p>
<p>or the right kind of client.</p>
<p>I got like in a lot of trouble for this recently</p>
<p>in the sex worker sphere,</p>
<p>because I said that if you raise prices,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more likely to encounter clients</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t going to abuse you.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s safer.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They said that I was being classist,</p>
<p>implying that poor people are more violent.</p>
<p>But to be fair, if you&rsquo;re a guy</p>
<p>and you want to be violent towards a woman,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably not gonna be paying her a lot of money.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably gonna be like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the kind of person likely who&rsquo;s going to haggle a lot</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t respect her.</p>
<p>But anyway, that aside, it&rsquo;s a little pet peeve for me.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just started charging 800 an hour</p>
<p>and then pretty rapidly raised it to 1200.</p>
<p>And then a while after that, raised it to 1400.</p>
<p>Well, the interesting thing you mentioned</p>
<p>in my extensive research,</p>
<p>you used to do 1200 to 1400 an hour.</p>
<p>And then you said that you&rsquo;re thinking of jumping back in</p>
<p>at a rate of 2400 the first hour.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I think 900 each successive hour.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, to me, that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Like why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a lot in the first hour, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s just because it depends on</p>
<p>how you want to incentivize the amount of hours.</p>
<p>So if you have to pay a lot for the first hour,</p>
<p>but not very much for the successive,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more likely to buy a longer period of time.</p>
<p>And usually I find that clients</p>
<p>who buy a longer period of time are nicer to you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a great theory for why that is,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re more likely to take you to dinner</p>
<p>and get to know you first.</p>
<p>And I just enjoy that a lot more.</p>
<p>I enjoy knowing who I&rsquo;m gonna have sex with.</p>
<p>Like a date, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it incentivized the long form date dynamic</p>
<p>versus not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>How does money change the dynamic?</p>
<p>Just basic human dynamic of interacting</p>
<p>for free versus for money.</p>
<p>Like I think about that a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like just talking to rich people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you usually get paid for your time</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing this for free.</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
<p>Is there a difference really or no?</p>
<p>A bit, yeah.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve actually, it depends a lot.</p>
<p>So when I was doing it full time,</p>
<p>it was my only source of income.</p>
<p>It changed quite a lot</p>
<p>because I was really incentivized to have repeat customers.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, okay, my primary interaction with you</p>
<p>is to have you hire me again.</p>
<p>I will do whatever that takes to make that happen.</p>
<p>And so if I have to laugh at jokes that I don&rsquo;t find funny</p>
<p>or be more adoring of your penis</p>
<p>than I actually genuinely feel,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to express.</p>
<p>And obviously it&rsquo;s to some degree titrated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unpleasant to force yourself</p>
<p>to like something that you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So I would actually not see clients again</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>But to some degree,</p>
<p>there was a sort of self-suppression going on,</p>
<p>which I think is the way it works</p>
<p>in any sort of customer service job.</p>
<p>Like you want the customer to leave happy.</p>
<p>So you just make sure that you are happy the whole time</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, ah, really enjoying the other person.</p>
<p>But so recently when I&rsquo;ve like kind of dabbled in it</p>
<p>since baking money through other means</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t need the money,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more like a fun side thing that I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>like I said, it&rsquo;s fulfilling the role of casual sex for me.</p>
<p>So like, I don&rsquo;t have to do it.</p>
<p>This is not my primary job.</p>
<p>I just want sort of a good excuse</p>
<p>to like have sex with somebody.</p>
<p>And the money is like a great filter for that.</p>
<p>And so in that case-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So the money is, yeah, okay.</p>
<p>The money is basically a filter</p>
<p>for somebody who&rsquo;s taking this interaction seriously.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It also, so there&rsquo;s an interesting like psychological thing</p>
<p>where I have difficulty having casual sex with somebody</p>
<p>because some part of my brain,</p>
<p>which I assume is like quite female,</p>
<p>is doing some evaluation of status</p>
<p>and whether or not this is going to damage my reputation</p>
<p>by having sex with them.</p>
<p>So like if you found out that I went</p>
<p>and like had random sex with like a homeless man,</p>
<p>you might be like, wow, that says something about Ayla.</p>
<p>Like maybe she&rsquo;s, you know, trashy</p>
<p>or she just has no standards for who she&rsquo;s gonna fuck.</p>
<p>But if, and so some part of me is continually anxious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, does this mean I have no standards</p>
<p>if I decide to have casual sex with you?</p>
<p>Like what are people going to think?</p>
<p>And so if you introduce money, it takes away that anxiety.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to worry about it because it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, of course Ayla would have sex with that person.</p>
<p>They paid her.</p>
<p>Like this is not an indication</p>
<p>of the kind of mate that she can get.</p>
<p>This is just an indication of like a business transaction.</p>
<p>And this allows me to enjoy casual sex so much more</p>
<p>when somebody pays me for it.</p>
<p>To the degree that like, I almost view it as a kink.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, so I&rsquo;m using it sort of</p>
<p>to replace casual sex now.</p>
<p>Like occasionally I&rsquo;m like, I just pay, you know,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s paying me a little bit to erase the anxiety</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll like have a fun time.</p>
<p>I mean, can&rsquo;t you see like dinner like that</p>
<p>or something like that if the person pays for dinner?</p>
<p>Or like, so like it&rsquo;s all just, if any money&rsquo;s involved,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a kink, then you could just like use it.</p>
<p>And you, buys a coffee at a Starbucks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, all right.</p>
<p>Right, but it has to be plausible.</p>
<p>Like you have to like trick my brain</p>
<p>into like having it actually be incentivizing for me.</p>
<p>Two coffees?</p>
<p>Like a cappuccino or something?</p>
<p>Yeah, like the homeless man bought me a coffee</p>
<p>and then I sucked his dick.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s not cool.</p>
<p>All right, so I.</p>
<p>No shade to homeless men, by the way.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve been friends with a lot of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just using like some sort of stereotype of.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right now.</p>
<p>So like it has to be plausible</p>
<p>where you could trick your mind.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>So now in this sort of frame, I am still,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m accepting money,</p>
<p>but still much more expressive of my actual preferences.</p>
<p>So like before when I would start escorting full-time,</p>
<p>I was suppressive.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m like, you know, fuck it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing this for me.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to make sure that I have a good time.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m much more demanding.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re having more fun</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not pretending.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Like laughing at a joke or something like that.</p>
<p>That sounds terrible.</p>
<p>Sounds like.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also like social.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess I would, would I do that?</p>
<p>Like when you first meet people, like strangers and so on,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some aspect of like niceties,</p>
<p>but like, I don&rsquo;t know, intimacy,</p>
<p>like real intimacy requires like getting past the niceties.</p>
<p>Like laughing at somebody&rsquo;s joke when it&rsquo;s not funny,</p>
<p>feels like anti-intimacy.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I laugh at so many jokes automatically.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting because like, I don&rsquo;t mean to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to be fake,</p>
<p>but like if I&rsquo;m in a group of people</p>
<p>and somebody makes a joke and everybody laughs,</p>
<p>I laugh even before I&rsquo;m checking within myself,</p>
<p>like do I genuinely enjoy this joke?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>like the degree that I am sort of just like a result</p>
<p>of social programming in all cases,</p>
<p>that like when I&rsquo;m with a client,</p>
<p>back when I was doing it full time,</p>
<p>like it doesn&rsquo;t feel significantly different.</p>
<p>It just felt like a different version of myself.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Yeah, to that degree, to the degree you don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re going against your nature.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was very rare that I actually felt</p>
<p>like I was going against my nature.</p>
<p>What about the market of how much to charge?</p>
<p>So 2,400, like how transparent is that market?</p>
<p>Is there like a market?</p>
<p>Like how much can you sell when you&rsquo;re charging that much?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, like what are the competitors?</p>
<p>Like if this, like what do you,</p>
<p>are you just thinking of what,</p>
<p>cause you said it&rsquo;s a lot of is a bit more shrouded</p>
<p>in mystery, like it&rsquo;s more confidential.</p>
<p>Like do you have some transparency to the market,</p>
<p>what the competitors are and so on?</p>
<p>I did a survey of escort, it&rsquo;s only like 130.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to remember, and the median was around like four,</p>
<p>$300, I think an hour.</p>
<p>Oh wow.</p>
<p>Something like that with a very long tail at the top end.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to remember what the,</p>
<p>I also asked him the amount where I could calculate</p>
<p>the amount they made per month.</p>
<p>I think it was like six or $7,000 a month.</p>
<p>I need to double check that one, but.</p>
<p>I charged 50 bucks an hour.</p>
<p>You charged 50 bucks an hour?</p>
<p>You should raise your rates.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;d be, I&rsquo;d give a really shitty hand job.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>But usually the rates are around,</p>
<p>like if you want a median escort in a big city,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s usually four to $600.</p>
<p>A city, so the, sorry, four to 600?</p>
<p>In a big city, but like smaller cities,</p>
<p>you charge, the rates go lower.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so fascinating.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s like the most you&rsquo;ve ever seen somebody charge?</p>
<p>I think I am.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like the.</p>
<p>But at this point, it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m post work.</p>
<p>Like I can just put in a state number.</p>
<p>Does like, does the fact that you&rsquo;re sort of</p>
<p>like a sexuality expert, like a researcher and so on,</p>
<p>like your mind is fascinating as well,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re a bit of a celebrity,</p>
<p>does that play into it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or do you feel the celebrity now?</p>
<p>Like when you&rsquo;re with people?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Usually if people are interested in hanging out with me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because of that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>Like I think besides the fun part,</p>
<p>like this is a kink as opposed to this is a job,</p>
<p>like with this as a job,</p>
<p>usually the high end is closer to 2000 an hour,</p>
<p>like the very high end.</p>
<p>Have clients ever fallen in love with you?</p>
<p>I think so, yeah.</p>
<p>I think it happens to me much less than most other people</p>
<p>due to like the thing I think we were talking about before.</p>
<p>Which is what?</p>
<p>Where like, you know, you give off vibes,</p>
<p>maybe like subconscious vibes.</p>
<p>But they have fallen in love, but not as often.</p>
<p>I think something about my signaling indicates</p>
<p>that people should not fall in love with me</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think it happens very much.</p>
<p>And it happens a lot with other women, but I know.</p>
<p>But I have occasionally had,</p>
<p>the thing is it&rsquo;s hard for me</p>
<p>because I try to be as vulnerable as I can</p>
<p>in a connection with a client.</p>
<p>And like, I do really like some of them.</p>
<p>I still remember some of them very fondly.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I hope they&rsquo;re doing well.</p>
<p>And some of them are really profound.</p>
<p>Like one guy saw me because he found out</p>
<p>he was dying of cancer.</p>
<p>And he was like, I don&rsquo;t wanna die without seeing someone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, Jesus Christ, that&rsquo;s such a,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m very touched</p>
<p>by many of the people that I saw.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like deep intimacy there.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know that it&rsquo;s brief</p>
<p>and I know that it&rsquo;s like kind of weird,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s like a real glimpse into somebody&rsquo;s soul</p>
<p>when you get to be intimate.</p>
<p>And I think this is especially true for men</p>
<p>because a lot of time men don&rsquo;t have like a way</p>
<p>to be really vulnerable in front of anybody.</p>
<p>But like, if you&rsquo;re in bed with a woman</p>
<p>that you find to be attractive,</p>
<p>you can sort of let loose a little bit more.</p>
<p>So they can become vulnerable in general quickly?</p>
<p>Yeah, and I really like that.</p>
<p>I like being as vulnerable as I can to match it.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m not forcing myself or anything,</p>
<p>but like, I just feel into it</p>
<p>and like notice how beautiful the person was</p>
<p>and like feel grateful for being able</p>
<p>to be in this intimate experience with them.</p>
<p>And that was so wonderful.</p>
<p>Does it ever hurt to say goodbye?</p>
<p>No, but I think that&rsquo;s unique to me</p>
<p>because I like being alone a lot.</p>
<p>Even with my friends who I like dearly,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like happy not seeing them</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t like making facial expressions very much.</p>
<p>But I do miss some of my clients.</p>
<p>Wait, sorry.</p>
<p>What does making facial expression</p>
<p>have to do with saying goodbye?</p>
<p>Well, if you are not with somebody in person,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to make facial expressions anymore.</p>
<p>Oh, you can just think about them.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can just sit there, a totally blank face,</p>
<p>and then have all of the emotions that you want.</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re telling me.</p>
<p>Do you have this thing too?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a thing, but like you&rsquo;re on camera.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So like, I feel feelings,</p>
<p>but people usually want you,</p>
<p>like social interaction is such that like,</p>
<p>you probably want me to show feelings on my face.</p>
<p>Yeah, like that, good job.</p>
<p>Yeah, there you go.</p>
<p>So like, I definitely,</p>
<p>there could be just an introvert thing</p>
<p>where you like have a vibrant inner world</p>
<p>that you forget to show to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>And also I&rsquo;m scared of social interaction,</p>
<p>and I just have a lot of anxiety</p>
<p>about interacting with the external world, so yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of surprised to hear that</p>
<p>because when you talked about</p>
<p>finding the light in everything and everything is fun,</p>
<p>like I usually don&rsquo;t associate that</p>
<p>with having not very much anxiety.</p>
<p>Well, because I have the, we mentioned that earlier,</p>
<p>I just appreciate the beauty in the world when I observe it,</p>
<p>but then when I&rsquo;m interacting with others,</p>
<p>I have a very harsh self-critical aspect to my brain</p>
<p>that says like, you&rsquo;re gonna fuck this up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna fuck up this interaction.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna fuck up the beauty that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m sort of being fragile and vulnerable for a moment,</p>
<p>one of the things I&rsquo;m afraid of,</p>
<p>I get so much love from people that listen,</p>
<p>or even like reach out,</p>
<p>like you said through the survey, like women and so on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid that, yeah, you know,</p>
<p>you admire me because you don&rsquo;t know me,</p>
<p>but you won&rsquo;t admire me once you know me.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s self-critical, but it&rsquo;s a silly,</p>
<p>I mean, as you get older, you&rsquo;re like, yeah, okay.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m able to step away and objectively look at myself</p>
<p>and I was like, there&rsquo;s no, it&rsquo;s just, you&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still, this is the part of the brain</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t just shut off.</p>
<p>What would fucking up in this conversation look like?</p>
<p>Like, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be rational,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m curious if there&rsquo;s like a specific thing.</p>
<p>A lot of it is just a feeling,</p>
<p>like an amorphous fear of failure.</p>
<p>What it would actually look like,</p>
<p>maybe because we&rsquo;re talking about sexuality,</p>
<p>me not being able to eloquently explain</p>
<p>the world view I have and why I appreciate it,</p>
<p>that would make me feel like a failure</p>
<p>because that would make me feel like</p>
<p>maybe you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing, right?</p>
<p>Because sexuality, not sexuality,</p>
<p>but even romantic relationships</p>
<p>are really important to happiness.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really important to me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure like the conception of love I have,</p>
<p>romantic love, is like fully made rigorous.</p>
<p>So especially when I&rsquo;m talking to you</p>
<p>that thinks very rigorously about a lot of these topics,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ve thought about them a lot.</p>
<p>I feel them.</p>
<p>I interact with the world in the space of feelings.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m almost afraid to be very rigorous</p>
<p>with these kinds of thoughts.</p>
<p>And so I think the failure would be like,</p>
<p>I would be confronted with the fact</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t explain what makes me happy.</p>
<p>That could be a failure.</p>
<p>And there could be just a bunch of other failures.</p>
<p>Another big failure is like,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re a really brilliant person.</p>
<p>And a lot of folks I know know and admire your work as well.</p>
<p>And so like for me not to be part of highlighting</p>
<p>that brilliance would be a failure, definitely.</p>
<p>Like, because then other people might feel like,</p>
<p>like notice the discrepancy or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, but no, no, no, that&rsquo;s not other people,</p>
<p>just my personal feeling.</p>
<p>And the other is like jokes,</p>
<p>because like we&rsquo;re talking about sex, right?</p>
<p>So for me, like, it&rsquo;s fun to just joke around,</p>
<p>but you also have to tread carefully</p>
<p>because like it&rsquo;s a weird surface</p>
<p>because like, you know, even I already feel bad</p>
<p>about making a joke for 50 bucks</p>
<p>for a handjob that&rsquo;s crappy by me.</p>
<p>But I think sometimes you just gotta go for it.</p>
<p>I went for it, it kind of fell flat on its face,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the thing of the conversation.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s like this fear where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>if you become like scientific about something,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll figure out that your feelings are unjustified.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ll experience this horrible thing</p>
<p>where like, ah, shit, like I&rsquo;m like afraid of this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sort of being forced to by my logical mind</p>
<p>to like believe this thing,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t think this is true at all.</p>
<p>I think like your feelings are there for a reason,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re for a good reason.</p>
<p>And like logic or like rigorous analysis</p>
<p>or something should be dedicated</p>
<p>to figuring out why it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>Not to like suppress it or tell it it shouldn&rsquo;t be there.</p>
<p>What do you think is more important to just life,</p>
<p>to reason versus emotion?</p>
<p>Not life, to what makes us human, I guess.</p>
<p>My romantic narrative answer to this,</p>
<p>which is like not rigorous at all is curiosity.</p>
<p>Curiosity.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What is curiosity?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a middle ground.</p>
<p>Curiosity is like both emotion and reason, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like this pull,</p>
<p>because reason is the tool you use to figure out the puzzle.</p>
<p>And then curiosity is the pull towards the puzzle.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t like worldviews that pit like emotion</p>
<p>and rationality is opposite each other.</p>
<p>They feel like beautiful parts of like a cohesive whole.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re doing rationality to the extent</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like suppressing</p>
<p>some emotional reactions you have,</p>
<p>then I think you&rsquo;re doing it wrong.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like missing a big part of it.</p>
<p>Like it should be like integrated.</p>
<p>It should be like part of like one unified flow.</p>
<p>Like the things that you like,</p>
<p>if you want to be in a romantic committed relationship</p>
<p>for the rest of your life,</p>
<p>then this is like beautiful and good.</p>
<p>And the kind of like logic that you&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>to make sense of the world</p>
<p>should be fitted into that correctly.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>Like anytime you have sort of like an internal</p>
<p>at odds thing with it,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re like using some sort of force</p>
<p>to suppress one or the other.</p>
<p>Like, oh, I&rsquo;m not allowed to reason about this</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m not allowed to feel about that.</p>
<p>And that feels harsh to me.</p>
<p>And I think curiosity is the solution.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re simply just calmly curious,</p>
<p>oh, why do I feel like that?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go find out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so cool, right?</p>
<p>Like you can use logic and your feelings</p>
<p>to like discover the answer.</p>
<p>Do you sometimes,</p>
<p>because you do this kind of technique,</p>
<p>which is interesting.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve mentioned it to others.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll sometimes step away</p>
<p>from like a third person perspective</p>
<p>and describe the feeling you&rsquo;re feeling.</p>
<p>Or like even just the situation,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;ll step out and talk about,</p>
<p>wait, what is happening here?</p>
<p>Like in the conversation itself.</p>
<p>In the conversation itself.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>First of all, what is that?</p>
<p>Do you find that to be useful and interesting?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>It feels raw and honest.</p>
<p>The danger of it seems like you escape</p>
<p>the actual experience of it though.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the trade-off.</p>
<p>You make it intellectual, right?</p>
<p>Is it though, intellectual to do that?</p>
<p>I mean, maybe it is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s the wrong word.</p>
<p>You can make it intellectual.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you can still continue the same flavor</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not fully disengaging from the conversation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just creating an extra metal layer.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s happening at the same time.</p>
<p>I think exploring the emotional reaction</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s going on in the moment.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, in some way it&rsquo;s actually making it stronger.</p>
<p>Like, or enriching it.</p>
<p>Like making it more, giving it more context,</p>
<p>giving it deeper understanding.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s like a way of going meta</p>
<p>that is a flinch move.</p>
<p>Like, oh, I noticed that we&rsquo;re doing this thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna name it.</p>
<p>And I think the thing that I described earlier,</p>
<p>like when the homeless guy approached me and asked,</p>
<p>you know, can you go home with me?</p>
<p>And I was like, are you trying to have sex</p>
<p>with me right now?</p>
<p>Like what I was doing is like a meta move.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re stepping outside and like, okay,</p>
<p>what is the purpose of this conversation?</p>
<p>And we explicitly identify it.</p>
<p>And in that case, I think that is sort of like a flinch move.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not telling him my emotional response.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like being fully present.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like sort of identifying it as a way</p>
<p>to subvert what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And I absolutely think this is a possible thing.</p>
<p>But I usually try to be aware of that myself.</p>
<p>And it depends on the purpose of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>That guy, cause that is actually like a chest move you did.</p>
<p>You had a purpose with that chest move,</p>
<p>but the flirtation is on.</p>
<p>Like he could have like done a better move</p>
<p>that would make you like curious.</p>
<p>Like, huh.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Like, interesting.</p>
<p>Cause you had an agenda with that,</p>
<p>but he could have changed your mind.</p>
<p>Like he could have, with a few words,</p>
<p>cause you just created extra layers, extra entry points.</p>
<p>If he had gone more meta,</p>
<p>it might&rsquo;ve been like, okay, well,</p>
<p>now I am going to sleep with you.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>See, there is something, yeah,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s aids into the chemistry of the conversation</p>
<p>when you do that meta.</p>
<p>I really enjoy it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a rare, I forget, did you not,</p>
<p>I forget who,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a few people do that with me,</p>
<p>like just in conversation.</p>
<p>And I feel like you were involved somehow,</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;ve met you before, somewhere.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we were,</p>
<p>or you were just in-</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been at a couple of parties together.</p>
<p>Maybe it was just like a bunch of people</p>
<p>that kind of play with the same,</p>
<p>or like a comfortable-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s circling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a practice explicitly dedicated towards that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s circling?</p>
<p>Circling is like-</p>
<p>That might be the thing they-</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>We know we have some mutual circlers in our-</p>
<p>Circlers?</p>
<p>In our networks here.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s circling?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember what&rsquo;s circling.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna describe it horribly,</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s like one of those things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s difficult to describe unless you experience it,</p>
<p>like kind of like drugs.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s something like you sit around,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like kind of guidelines to the conversation</p>
<p>where you talk about the present moment,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like honest about your experiences</p>
<p>as much as you can be.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t wanna be honest,</p>
<p>then you say, I don&rsquo;t wanna be honest.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s your commitment to connection.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re here to actually connect with the other person,</p>
<p>understand them, and be understood.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not supposed to project.</p>
<p>So if you have an analysis about the other person,</p>
<p>you own it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m experiencing you as this,</p>
<p>and then you check, is it true?</p>
<p>Or like-</p>
<p>Are you supposed to be almost like converting it</p>
<p>towards the thing you&rsquo;re thinking, like constantly?</p>
<p>Are you supposed to say what you&rsquo;re thinking?</p>
<p>If it feels right in the moment, you can.</p>
<p>The thing is, it&rsquo;s very amorphous, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like almost like creating a magical sensation.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been with some,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some very good circlers,</p>
<p>really high skill circle.</p>
<p>And I feel like I&rsquo;m on drugs when that happens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very rare to see.</p>
<p>Does it feel honest somehow?</p>
<p>Yeah, very honest.</p>
<p>Like right now in this moment,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling like kind of like nervous energy</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m talking to you and this is a unique situation.</p>
<p>And like, I want you to think I&rsquo;m cool.</p>
<p>I want everybody listening to me to think I&rsquo;m cool,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also having some sort of delight</p>
<p>at being able to express in this way.</p>
<p>And like some admiration for how you like set up</p>
<p>and built this thing that I can be a part of.</p>
<p>And all of these things are sort of in my body right now</p>
<p>as this sort of vibrating high thing.</p>
<p>I remember like in the party setting,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve had to talk to a few people,</p>
<p>I felt like it was going sexual very quickly.</p>
<p>Okay, I don&rsquo;t know if you remember this,</p>
<p>but the first time I met you, I didn&rsquo;t know who you were.</p>
<p>I just heard, I knew I&rsquo;d heard your name,</p>
<p>like you introduced your name.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I think I&rsquo;ve heard people discuss that.</p>
<p>And I was in the middle of a very sexual conversation</p>
<p>with another woman.</p>
<p>Oh, you were?</p>
<p>Yeah, I was.</p>
<p>And you just like turned around</p>
<p>and left very shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>And I thought it was very-</p>
<p>Oh, was I listening in on the conversation</p>
<p>or something like that?</p>
<p>I think it was like, I was talking to her</p>
<p>and you were just kind of like right there.</p>
<p>And so we introduced ourselves</p>
<p>and then we continued on with the conversation.</p>
<p>You were like standing there and listening.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I would have left the cut.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s funny, you probably interpret it in a different way.</p>
<p>I interpret it as you like not wanting to listen</p>
<p>to like graphic sexual stuff.</p>
<p>Was it like super graphic?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I was asking her about, I was doing it,</p>
<p>I was interviewing her about her fetish, basically.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I don&rsquo;t think I would have walked away from that.</p>
<p>I would have been like curious.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t often see people</p>
<p>having a deep interview about fetishes.</p>
<p>Like I wouldn&rsquo;t even be, listen, I&rsquo;m like Jane Goodall here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not afraid of sexuality.</p>
<p>I just have certain values in terms of like monogamy</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>But I think sexuality is really beautiful.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think, yeah, I can&rsquo;t imagine myself</p>
<p>walking away from that conversation.</p>
<p>Somebody must have like called you or something.</p>
<p>Because I didn&rsquo;t remember exactly how it worked.</p>
<p>I just remember thinking later on.</p>
<p>Or maybe I thought I was intruding.</p>
<p>Oh, maybe.</p>
<p>I was kind of drunk, so.</p>
<p>And I probably was very drunk too.</p>
<p>I would like to actually have like footage</p>
<p>of that conversation so we can actually interpret</p>
<p>what actually happened because it was probably,</p>
<p>I mean, human interactions are funny like that.</p>
<p>It can happen for all kinds of reasons.</p>
<p>Have you ever fallen in love with a client?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I mean, like in tiny ways, like micro loves.</p>
<p>Have you ever fallen in love love?</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know what it means, but probably.</p>
<p>The thing that other people say when they say fall in love</p>
<p>is probably something I&rsquo;ve experienced.</p>
<p>What do you think they mean?</p>
<p>What is love?</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fantastic question.</p>
<p>I think, so love is one of those words</p>
<p>that refers to like a billion different concepts.</p>
<p>And I think we maybe should just taboo the term</p>
<p>to have a better understanding of what we&rsquo;re referring to.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s things like feeling intense attachment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something feeling like soulfully aligned.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like sexual attraction.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like excitement.</p>
<p>Are you talking to me and saying we should taboo</p>
<p>the term love in this conversation?</p>
<p>How dare you?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Romantic love.</p>
<p>To make it flourish into lots of other new definitions.</p>
<p>Okay, thank you.</p>
<p>For expanding love.</p>
<p>It sounds like you&rsquo;re censoring the most important word.</p>
<p>This is like 1984 all over again.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Also on the book reading list.</p>
<p>No, okay.</p>
<p>Listen, no, romantic love, like a deep intimacy</p>
<p>for somebody, like a deep connection with a human being</p>
<p>that is also, I mean, yeah, with polyamory, it&rsquo;s tricky.</p>
<p>And your relationship with sex is also tricky.</p>
<p>So like, what&rsquo;s the difference between a deep friendship</p>
<p>and a friendship that also has a sexual component?</p>
<p>I remember being very confused about that</p>
<p>when I did a lot of LSD.</p>
<p>I was like, what?</p>
<p>The line between romantic relationships</p>
<p>and everything else kind of got blurred.</p>
<p>I was like, oh, I&rsquo;m just like in intimacy.</p>
<p>And some intimacies mean that you spend your life together</p>
<p>more and have sex.</p>
<p>But like the same basic thing is there.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re seeing someone for who they are.</p>
<p>Do you think you can be, if you&rsquo;re heterosexual,</p>
<p>do you think you could be really deeply close friends</p>
<p>with a guy and not have sexual relationships with him?</p>
<p>I assume it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Like if anything is ever possible, then probably, yeah.</p>
<p>Everything is possible.</p>
<p>Time travel is possible.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics makes every,</p>
<p>traveling faster than the speed of light is possible,</p>
<p>according to general relativity.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying there&rsquo;s a chance.</p>
<p>Dummer has taught me that everything is fucking possible.</p>
<p>But not super likely,</p>
<p>assuming that they are like attracted to each other.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And for somebody that has surveys and statistical analysis,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re interested in like, what&rsquo;s the likely thing here</p>
<p>versus like what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>If you say possible, it&rsquo;s like anything&rsquo;s open.</p>
<p>Did you just avoid answering the love thing?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I have a lot to say about love.</p>
<p>I just need to be precise.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be precisely and precise and continue.</p>
<p>Oops, sorry, that&rsquo;s my phone.</p>
<p>It feels like a passive aggressive suggestion</p>
<p>that we shouldn&rsquo;t talk about love anymore,</p>
<p>but we shall continue.</p>
<p>No, we should absolutely talk about love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the term is very confusing.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s like, some people say the word love</p>
<p>and the thing that they&rsquo;re thinking of is like,</p>
<p>oh, the butterfly is like the sparkle thing</p>
<p>that I get in my stomach when I think about my loved one.</p>
<p>But I study relationships over time.</p>
<p>I just really, like I did a survey about it.</p>
<p>And that sparkle goes away within like two to four years.</p>
<p>But people still report loving their partner after that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, okay, like when you say the word love,</p>
<p>what the fuck are we talking about?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I just wanna get on the same page.</p>
<p>Okay, so what are the different?</p>
<p>So the butterflies, boy, I&rsquo;d like to push back</p>
<p>on two to four years on the butterflies, but okay.</p>
<p>I mean, statistically, not everybody.</p>
<p>Butterflies don&rsquo;t give a fuck about statistics.</p>
<p>You ever heard of the flap of a butterfly wing</p>
<p>causing like nuclear war?</p>
<p>How do you describe that with your statistics?</p>
<p>Okay, so butterflies, that&rsquo;s the basic infatuation,</p>
<p>the chemistry of the initial interactions.</p>
<p>Sure, but a deep, meaningful connection</p>
<p>like that feels like sexuality is a component of that.</p>
<p>Like the kind of intimacy that&rsquo;s only possible</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re also sexual with another human being.</p>
<p>On top of that, you have the butterfly.</p>
<p>And on top of that, you have the friendship.</p>
<p>And on top of that, you have like, what is that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a sandwich full of-</p>
<p>The love sandwich.</p>
<p>The love sandwich.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m down to call it a love sandwich.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;ll just call it sandwich, L-S.</p>
<p>Okay, what role does that play in the human condition?</p>
<p>He asked me about the human condition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting phrase.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, this is like not a phrase</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s common in my own thinking.</p>
<p>Sure, human condition is a good summary.</p>
<p>You know, what do you think?</p>
<p>What do you feel when I say human condition?</p>
<p>I ask very different kinds of questions than you.</p>
<p>Sure, yeah.</p>
<p>Which is interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to like figure out</p>
<p>like what kind of brain that you have</p>
<p>is like creating like this category of question.</p>
<p>Which is why I was like saying</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s something about a poetic narrative in there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s very like aesthetic.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve asked much more aesthetic questions</p>
<p>than I do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what the word aesthetic means, really.</p>
<p>Like artistic.</p>
<p>Artistic.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I know what aesthetic means,</p>
<p>but I also don&rsquo;t know what it means.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like the word love.</p>
<p>Aesthetic perspective.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, but part of it in conversation,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to ask a question that has an answer.</p>
<p>Fully, always.</p>
<p>Like do you have an example of a question that has-</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of, oh, it has an answer.</p>
<p>Yeah, like one that you think is like,</p>
<p>ah, that&rsquo;s like a bad question because it has an answer.</p>
<p>How many sexual partners you had in the last year?</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a, okay.</p>
<p>I feel like we just like got to some sort of crux</p>
<p>about like the kinds of questions that we like to answer.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Because I would love that question.</p>
<p>Okay, right.</p>
<p>To ask enough people.</p>
<p>All right, but does that really tell the story</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;ve felt over the past year?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, but then I could just tell you.</p>
<p>Okay, so by when you&rsquo;re saying the kinds of questions</p>
<p>that you like, the ones that don&rsquo;t have an answer,</p>
<p>by not an answer, you mean like not an answer</p>
<p>where you can know that you&rsquo;re done telling it.</p>
<p>Is that-</p>
<p>That you can escape having to think</p>
<p>by actually answering it.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The struggle is the place where we discover something,</p>
<p>not the destination.</p>
<p>Contention.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s working, it&rsquo;s working.</p>
<p>Okay, so what is the role of the love sandwich</p>
<p>in the human condition?</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I take that question, but it&rsquo;s a stupid question.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready to chat.</p>
<p>Do you like love?</p>
<p>Do you personally like love?</p>
<p>Do you not like love?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think there&rsquo;s a part of me</p>
<p>that feels like I have unconditional love for all things.</p>
<p>Like when you&rsquo;re talking about the glass being beautiful,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve felt that.</p>
<p>That feels like it rang something,</p>
<p>that like I have a similar resonance in me for that.</p>
<p>If I were to circle right now,</p>
<p>I feel like you&rsquo;re avoiding the love question,</p>
<p>the love sandwich question.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your own personal feeling</p>
<p>towards loving another human being</p>
<p>versus having sex with another human being?</p>
<p>Love is like one of the concepts</p>
<p>that dissolved for me a long time ago.</p>
<p>So I have difficulty directly answering it.</p>
<p>But I have the experience.</p>
<p>When you described the love sandwich,</p>
<p>I feel like I have had that experience.</p>
<p>I have it currently for some people also.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m dating people and I have that.</p>
<p>So people who you date,</p>
<p>you would describe sharing a love sandwich with them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So how does, I mean, that&rsquo;s great to hear.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not, are you afraid of love?</p>
<p>No, not at all.</p>
<p>So can you describe to me polyamory?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>What does it mean?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s like different terms.</p>
<p>You have a nice blog post about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have a personal definition of it,</p>
<p>which I readily admit is not shared by a lot of people.</p>
<p>But to me, the definition of polyamory</p>
<p>is simply not forbidding your partner</p>
<p>from pursuing intimacy with others.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that you have to pursue it personally.</p>
<p>Like two people could be married</p>
<p>and only have had sex with each other for 20 years.</p>
<p>And as long as they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>you know what, if ever you wanna go have sex</p>
<p>with somebody else, you&rsquo;re welcome to do that.</p>
<p>Well, the interesting thing you said is</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean they have to do it.</p>
<p>They just have the freedom to do it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s the freedom that matters to me.</p>
<p>Which is, I mean, it&rsquo;s called the polyamory post.</p>
<p>You have so many good blog posts.</p>
<p>People should just go look at your, read your writing.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s really, really strong and often backed by data,</p>
<p>but also just a deeply honest look at yourself</p>
<p>and your understanding of the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s, yeah, it&rsquo;s refreshing to be there.</p>
<p>Like with a lot of stuff I disagree with,</p>
<p>but I feel like if I disagree with it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be very open to arguing and kind of</p>
<p>thinking through it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just the honesty that radiates from the whole thing.</p>
<p>Anyway, so yeah, it&rsquo;s, I mean, it would be interesting</p>
<p>to kind of explore what polyamory, like how it works.</p>
<p>What are the different versions?</p>
<p>What is the, what does that freedom look like?</p>
<p>What does that freedom feel like?</p>
<p>To be able to go see other people.</p>
<p>Depends on you.</p>
<p>Like, do you want to go see other people?</p>
<p>Maybe you do, maybe you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So usually for me, I tend to be pretty happy</p>
<p>with like one or a few people.</p>
<p>And then occasionally I like some novelty.</p>
<p>So usually I&rsquo;ll go like, like I host orgy sometimes.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll host an orgy and then I&rsquo;ll go have sex</p>
<p>with people at the orgy.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;ll be good for the novelty for a while.</p>
<p>Can I ask you about orgies?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So how many people are at an orgy?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s like a standard, we&rsquo;re having a Sunday picnic</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an orgy.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s like a number of people at an orgy?</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;ve only recently started hosting orgies,</p>
<p>but I have been to a lot of orgies.</p>
<p>I would say like the median is maybe 15 people.</p>
<p>I like how you say median versus mean.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Median is 15 people.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the gender distribution usually?</p>
<p>Usually about even.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like ideal if you can get more women than men</p>
<p>in most of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently been hosting free use orgies</p>
<p>or orgies where consent is assumed by default when you enter.</p>
<p>And of course you can revoke it anytime</p>
<p>or go over a whole bunch of rules</p>
<p>to make sure it&rsquo;s very safe.</p>
<p>You like have wristbands.</p>
<p>So nobody&rsquo;s actually doing anything they don&rsquo;t want to,</p>
<p>but in those ones, you have to have more men than women.</p>
<p>I thought free use was like consensual, like at any time,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s at any time within the constraints of this building</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So at the orgies, it&rsquo;s like you, by entering,</p>
<p>if you wear a wristband,</p>
<p>then you are like by default opting into consent.</p>
<p>So people don&rsquo;t have to like do a thing</p>
<p>where they negotiate with you and like to be like,</p>
<p>is this okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the default is like, you just go for it.</p>
<p>And if they want you to stop, they say the safe word,</p>
<p>like red, don&rsquo;t, and then you have to stop.</p>
<p>And we do like exercise in the beginning</p>
<p>of people saying red to make sure</p>
<p>that everybody knows exactly what the rules are.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite safe word?</p>
<p>Red.</p>
<p>Red.</p>
<p>When I first started doing like weird kinky shit,</p>
<p>I was like, oh, let&rsquo;s make a safe word.</p>
<p>And we picked the word foliage.</p>
<p>I was like, that&rsquo;s goofy, right?</p>
<p>And then, but then eventually came a time</p>
<p>where I did actually, in fact, want to say the safe word</p>
<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t, I was like in agony.</p>
<p>I was like crying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I can&rsquo;t make myself say this stupid word</p>
<p>right now.</p>
<p>Foliage.</p>
<p>So after that, I was like, red, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not funny.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just going with very simple red.</p>
<p>How does an orgy compare sexually</p>
<p>to like a one-on-one sexual experience?</p>
<p>Like what, is it same ballpark</p>
<p>or is it fundamentally different?</p>
<p>I mean, the experience of both orgies</p>
<p>and one-on-one sex can be like really high variety.</p>
<p>But you kind of, it&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re having sex with someone,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re surrounded by really realistic VR porn</p>
<p>of other people having sex.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, cool.</p>
<p>And sometimes it&rsquo;s like threesomes also,</p>
<p>like maybe there&rsquo;s another person involved,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s hard to like have a whole bunch of people</p>
<p>on one, in one cluster.</p>
<p>Cause usually there&rsquo;s kind of different little clusters</p>
<p>of people having their experience.</p>
<p>I once was part of a 10 woman orgy.</p>
<p>It was a total lesbian thing.</p>
<p>And that felt like a writhing cluster.</p>
<p>It was very nice.</p>
<p>But typically you kind of separate out</p>
<p>with like very small pods of people doing stuff.</p>
<p>Okay, so back to polyamory.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s a good, what does it take to manage?</p>
<p>Do you have a main partner?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re being polyamorous</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re dating multiple people,</p>
<p>is there usually a main one for you personally?</p>
<p>For me personally, kind of, yes.</p>
<p>Like right now I kind of, two that aren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>like I see roughly around,</p>
<p>for me it&rsquo;s kind of just descriptive.</p>
<p>Like if I just happen to be seeing you a lot more</p>
<p>and I confide in you more than you,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re descriptively my primary partner.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t usually have rules to protect that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m down with rules to protect it</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re trying to build something.</p>
<p>Like if I buy a house together, I&rsquo;d be like, okay,</p>
<p>we need to like, whatever our relationship is,</p>
<p>we have to do the thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re both paying the rent for the house</p>
<p>or the mortgage or whatever.</p>
<p>A lot of people do have primaries,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s very common to have like prescriptive,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m gonna get married to you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not allowed to like have anal sex</p>
<p>with anybody else, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>What about like the transparency</p>
<p>and the communication they have to do?</p>
<p>Yeah, I usually try to be super honest about it.</p>
<p>Extremely, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve learned over time that like,</p>
<p>even if it seems like a very small thing,</p>
<p>you talk about the small thing.</p>
<p>Because often I would just sort of have like a small twitch</p>
<p>in myself, like, I don&rsquo;t know if I like that.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d be like, okay, this is really minor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably nothing.</p>
<p>And if I talk about it, it&rsquo;s gonna make it into a thing.</p>
<p>And I just don&rsquo;t wanna make it into a thing, you know?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve come to realize</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s worth making it into a thing.</p>
<p>Because I can&rsquo;t predict at the time</p>
<p>if like this small feeling I have is going to grow.</p>
<p>And then when I grow it,</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s like much more difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s like any little bit of jealousy</p>
<p>I have, I immediately communicate it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, ah, I&rsquo;m a little jealous of you right now.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hold that in at all.</p>
<p>I used to be kind of like,</p>
<p>back when I first started being poly,</p>
<p>I used to try to pretend that I was not a jealous person.</p>
<p>And that backfired quite a lot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>So you do still feel jealousy?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>And like, and it&rsquo;s also interesting</p>
<p>that you kind of recommend</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a little bit of jealousy,</p>
<p>like to bring that to the surface.</p>
<p>Yeah, just like excessively communicate.</p>
<p>Even if it feels stupid.</p>
<p>Like this is, I feel like a cliche.</p>
<p>I feel like a stupid therapist training video.</p>
<p>Like I just feel ridiculous sometimes</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m saying the things.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just, I&rsquo;ve learned over time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just important to just say the things.</p>
<p>Because like, you know,</p>
<p>the traditional view of jealousy is exactly like you said,</p>
<p>if you bring it up to the surface,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s going to sound like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re overreacting to everything.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying like, still do it.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re basically,</p>
<p>your brain blows stuff out of proportion.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s good to like,</p>
<p>be going through it with a partner.</p>
<p>Like I have a partner right now</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s like dating this other girl</p>
<p>and he like really likes her</p>
<p>and he like went traveling with her and stuff.</p>
<p>And I was like, ah, I feel jealous about it.</p>
<p>And I have to tell him that,</p>
<p>and that way he can be with me in it.</p>
<p>He like holds me when I&rsquo;m feeling jealous.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like a bonding experience, you know?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s important for me that like he&rsquo;s able to handle it.</p>
<p>Like I try not to date people who really freak out</p>
<p>when I have negative emotions,</p>
<p>because I want to be able to express</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m upset by something they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>without it being taken as a demand</p>
<p>that they change their behavior.</p>
<p>Right, so he has to be able to skillfully</p>
<p>handle that interaction.</p>
<p>He has to be like, cool, all right, you&rsquo;re jealous.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m not going to freak out about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to change my behavior.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to be with you in that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to sit in it together.</p>
<p>I mean, is some of that just insecurity</p>
<p>that he should also just comfort,</p>
<p>like basically alleviate your insecurity,</p>
<p>bring you back to like a rational objective evaluation?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I mean, my relationships,</p>
<p>I love it when people do not reassure me.</p>
<p>I like not being comforted quite a lot.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And so usually the people I date don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very gravitating.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s one of the things people do</p>
<p>to make me fall in love with them</p>
<p>is if I say something really like terrible,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just like,</p>
<p>do not give me any comfort whatsoever.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s where my heart gets captured.</p>
<p>So I typically am in relationships</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m like, I mean, I&rsquo;m so jealous.</p>
<p>And they just like, do not reassure me at all.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s good because it doesn&rsquo;t give me an out.</p>
<p>Like I have to deal with it myself.</p>
<p>Like maybe it is true that the other woman</p>
<p>is better than me.</p>
<p>Like maybe that is an actual possible reality.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to be dealing with my life</p>
<p>in a way where I&rsquo;m like pretending</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m only okay when that reality is not true.</p>
<p>Would you like them to say that,</p>
<p>that the other woman is better than you?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or that they prefer.</p>
<p>If they feel that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, they should say it according to themselves.</p>
<p>Like I have a better time with her</p>
<p>than I have with you,</p>
<p>then I would want to know that, yeah.</p>
<p>And even though that might be painful to hear.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That which can be destroyed by the truth should be.</p>
<p>That which can be destroyed by the truth.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>That your ego or something like that?</p>
<p>Yeah, my ego.</p>
<p>So your ego just generally grows</p>
<p>and you like the destruction of it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like really accurate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a process of truth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like a fun experience.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve had like guys be like,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;re not as pretty as I&rsquo;d like.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just like, oh, you know,</p>
<p>stabbed to the heart and.</p>
<p>But then also like give me your number after.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Man, that&rsquo;s kind of beautiful.</p>
<p>What do you think of monogamous relationships?</p>
<p>Like philosophically,</p>
<p>can you maybe steal a man</p>
<p>or make the case for monogamous relationships?</p>
<p>Can you understand the pros and cons</p>
<p>of monogamous relationships?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it depends on how you,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re like, hey,</p>
<p>we, you can do whatever you want,</p>
<p>but you and I are gonna spend the rest.</p>
<p>Like we just, you&rsquo;re 80 years old and like,</p>
<p>oh, we spent 60 years in a marriage together.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never had sex with anybody else.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s like awesome.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s what you want, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I have like a little bit more problems</p>
<p>with people doing that</p>
<p>while also forcing their partner</p>
<p>not to misbehave if they want to.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re like, oh,</p>
<p>we only made it this far in a monogamous relationship</p>
<p>because I forced my partner</p>
<p>not to pursue an intimacy that she wanted to.</p>
<p>Then I feel like a little like more like,</p>
<p>ah, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>How do you know if it&rsquo;s a real want for an intimacy?</p>
<p>Like checking out a attractive person</p>
<p>while being inside a monogamous relationship.</p>
<p>Yeah, how do you score that?</p>
<p>Is that bad that the person cannot pursue those feelings?</p>
<p>I mean, it depends if they want to.</p>
<p>Like I often find people attractive</p>
<p>if I don&rsquo;t want to pursue.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also okay with people entering into agreements.</p>
<p>Like if you and I want to agree,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m only going to enter this</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m gonna be so hurt if you pursue somebody else.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not gonna pursue anybody else.</p>
<p>That seems fine to me.</p>
<p>But I also extend that.</p>
<p>Like if somebody is like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want you to have any friends.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna feel really insecure if you,</p>
<p>and like, okay.</p>
<p>Like if you want to enter that agreement,</p>
<p>like I feel the same way.</p>
<p>Like I think you should have the right to do it</p>
<p>if this is what you want.</p>
<p>But I also kind of,</p>
<p>I feel like a little weird</p>
<p>about restricting your partner from doing things, you know?</p>
<p>Oh, but I guess if you&rsquo;re honest about it</p>
<p>and you just put it on the table,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want you to have any friends.</p>
<p>I want you to sit in a box.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think a lot-</p>
<p>I guess if you&rsquo;re like really on the,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a power dynamic</p>
<p>that like you can be quite influential in a relationship</p>
<p>in convincing your partner.</p>
<p>And it sure sounds like you&rsquo;re honestly agreeing to a thing,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not really agreeing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the, I mean,</p>
<p>part of that is the beauty of relationships, right?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s messy.</p>
<p>It can be messy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know what you really want, right?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s mainly my complaint with monogamy.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m down with like conscious monogamy.</p>
<p>But I think so many relationships</p>
<p>are like monogamous by default.</p>
<p>Like people, it&rsquo;s not actually right for them,</p>
<p>but they just get into it</p>
<p>because culture just doesn&rsquo;t give them another option.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t even ask themselves the question,</p>
<p>is this right for me?</p>
<p>Which like, I&rsquo;m a weird ass person</p>
<p>who thinks a lot of weird shit,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t even think about polyamorous as an option</p>
<p>before I had heard that it existed.</p>
<p>And I was only when I first met my first polyamorous couple</p>
<p>and I was like, oh, that&rsquo;s what I am.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s clearly the thing that I am.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>Because to me, monogamy,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make sense for it to be a default.</p>
<p>Like to me, monogamy goes against human nature.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in some sense, like romance is a fuck you</p>
<p>to the way the world works.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah, like it&rsquo;s a, like Romeo and Juliet romance,</p>
<p>like traditional description of what romance looks like</p>
<p>versus like, sure, there&rsquo;s like a million variations</p>
<p>of that, but in my head,</p>
<p>like this partnership that&rsquo;s for a long time together</p>
<p>is a kind of, you know, like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>like true romance.</p>
<p>You know that movie?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really fucking good movie.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen it, no.</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re together against the world.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what close friendship feels like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like ride or die.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like that.</p>
<p>I guess it doesn&rsquo;t, it can span across multiple,</p>
<p>you can have multiple partners in that way.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>But I just don&rsquo;t see monogamy</p>
<p>as like this definitely not a default.</p>
<p>I would actually think, honestly,</p>
<p>would probably see polyamory as a more natural default.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I guess it depends</p>
<p>on what you mean by default.</p>
<p>Like most of human history has been sort of a weird mix.</p>
<p>Like you get polygamy and monogamy</p>
<p>are the kind of the main arrangements.</p>
<p>But I mean, it&rsquo;s just like human nature.</p>
<p>Like I-</p>
<p>Yeah, people are attracted to other people</p>
<p>and they want to.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Especially in longer term relationships.</p>
<p>I tracked, in my relationship survey,</p>
<p>I tracked the amount of cheating over time</p>
<p>in a relationship.</p>
<p>Like how long have you been in this relationship</p>
<p>and how have you cheated?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the results of that?</p>
<p>Men cheat a lot.</p>
<p>Women too, but men cheat about 30% more than women do.</p>
<p>I also asked men and women to predict</p>
<p>if they think their partner has cheated.</p>
<p>And people&rsquo;s predictions were about the same.</p>
<p>So people roughly predicted that their male or female</p>
<p>like spouse hadn&rsquo;t cheated about the same rate,</p>
<p>but men cheated much more than women.</p>
<p>So who was more correct in their prediction though?</p>
<p>So men were more correct in their prediction</p>
<p>predicting women and women were more off.</p>
<p>Women thought men cheated much less</p>
<p>than they actually did.</p>
<p>But both of them were off,</p>
<p>but like the male gap was significantly more.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>When you say monogamy is not default,</p>
<p>like I think you&rsquo;re like really getting at something.</p>
<p>Like human beings are just,</p>
<p>especially in long-term relationships,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s difficult to only want one person.</p>
<p>But to be fair,</p>
<p>I think monogamy and commitment are very different.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d be incredibly,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t known so many very long-term,</p>
<p>super committed poly couples that live lives</p>
<p>that look very similar</p>
<p>to the very romantic monogamous couples.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve been in their houses like 20 years.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that works great for them.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so much to like open your mind to</p>
<p>in these kinds of conversations, these kinds of ideas.</p>
<p>But I also like realize like some of the cake is baked.</p>
<p>Like I have some assumptions</p>
<p>that are hard to break through.</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>For myself, like it&rsquo;s difficult for me</p>
<p>to imagine a polyamorous relationship for me</p>
<p>that would work.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have enough data.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a, like I have very little,</p>
<p>but like at this point,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I haven&rsquo;t eaten pizza in like 20 years</p>
<p>because I know I just don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>I just eat low carb because it makes me feel good.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s so many foods I haven&rsquo;t explored.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, well, I know what I love.</p>
<p>So you explore every once in a while.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you kind of figure that out.</p>
<p>But at the same time, you&rsquo;re humbled by like,</p>
<p>even talking to you or looking at your data,</p>
<p>like sexuality is a fascinating topic</p>
<p>because it seems that we&rsquo;re very,</p>
<p>like we were talking about, very afraid of this topic.</p>
<p>Like to be really honest with ourselves about it.</p>
<p>The whole like academic research is afraid of it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s so core to who we are as human beings.</p>
<p>I got to ask you about this.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe it took this long to get there,</p>
<p>but one of your many fascinating surveys is on fetishes.</p>
<p>You wrote a blog post about it,</p>
<p>probably several, because it&rsquo;s like a huge data set.</p>
<p>Still in progress, yeah.</p>
<p>So the one I&rsquo;m referring to is on popularity</p>
<p>and taboo-ness of various fetishes.</p>
<p>So what are some interesting takeaways?</p>
<p>I got to pull up this graph because it&rsquo;s freaking epic.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a big graph and it has taboo-ness as one axis</p>
<p>and popularity as the other.</p>
<p>Okay, for people who are just listening,</p>
<p>on the X-axis is taboo-ness.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Asked to rate how taboo society viewed the sexual interest.</p>
<p>And on the Y-axis is percent of people reporting interest,</p>
<p>log scale.</p>
<p>Oh boy, all right.</p>
<p>So just some examples on the low taboo-ness</p>
<p>and high popularity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a correlation here.</p>
<p>I think you said it&rsquo;s 0.69.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not, it&rsquo;s just hilarious.</p>
<p>Is it still 0.69, are you tracking that?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t looked since I did this, yeah.</p>
<p>So like the less taboo stuff is more likely to be popular</p>
<p>and the more taboo stuff is less likely to be popular.</p>
<p>And on the missionary position,</p>
<p>fingering, vagina, blowjobs,</p>
<p>light spanking, cuddling.</p>
<p>Cuddling is more taboo than missionary?</p>
<p>I think people are conceiving,</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m really sexually aroused</p>
<p>by cuddling specifically,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re like, that&rsquo;s a little more weird</p>
<p>than getting specifically aroused by blowjobs.</p>
<p>You expect people to be aroused by blowjobs.</p>
<p>So this was like getting at like,</p>
<p>as a fetish versus like an activity.</p>
<p>Yeah, as a specific, as like a concrete sexual interest.</p>
<p>Like I am specifically interested in this thing, yeah.</p>
<p>And so those are thighs and lips, different body parts,</p>
<p>jaw lines, and then some of it is color</p>
<p>based on more female preference versus male preference.</p>
<p>Like jaw lines is more female preference.</p>
<p>Being submissive is more female preference.</p>
<p>Light bondage, yeah, more female.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of interesting ones.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much, okay.</p>
<p>But then on the far side of that,</p>
<p>I mean, it gets pretty dark,</p>
<p>but even all along the way,</p>
<p>like extreme bondage being at 50 tabooness,</p>
<p>pegging, pain, giving pain, sexual frustration,</p>
<p>I suppose, right, as a kink.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many interesting ones,</p>
<p>like to me, like just that I haven&rsquo;t even considered.</p>
<p>Yeah, I had to do so much research</p>
<p>into fetishes to compile the list.</p>
<p>Are there some surprising like options to you</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re like, oh, okay, this is like a fetish.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, more confusing was like</p>
<p>what the fetishes are about.</p>
<p>Cause like, I didn&rsquo;t want to overlap fetishes,</p>
<p>so I had to kind of look into them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, there&rsquo;s like such interesting manifestations</p>
<p>of core drives.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re really aroused by disgust,</p>
<p>like maybe you&rsquo;re very into rolling around in dirt,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not into rolling around with ice cream.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, okay, I have to make those</p>
<p>into two separate fetishes, you know.</p>
<p>And like, I&rsquo;m seeing like at the far end,</p>
<p>rodents,</p>
<p>like different types of incest,</p>
<p>branding, so there&rsquo;s like pain.</p>
<p>And then-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like wound fucking.</p>
<p>Sex with animals, I guess.</p>
<p>Dogs, horses.</p>
<p>Receiving oral sex from an animal is high taboo-ness</p>
<p>and pretty high popularity.</p>
<p>Yeah, surprisingly high popularity.</p>
<p>I was really shocked by that one.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t triple check that number</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;m like, no way this amount of people</p>
<p>are reporting interest.</p>
<p>Do you know which animal is there?</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t specify.</p>
<p>I asked like which animals are erotic</p>
<p>and then I separately asked like how erotic is it</p>
<p>to receive oral sex from your preferred animal?</p>
<p>This is so fascinating.</p>
<p>So I would like, can we just talk about the methodology</p>
<p>of this?</p>
<p>This feels like deeply honest map of humanity</p>
<p>in a way we don&rsquo;t usually map humanity.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, cause it&rsquo;s so mean,</p>
<p>like your fetishes are so meaningful</p>
<p>to each individual person.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what I love about this work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, nobody cares about someone&rsquo;s fetishes.</p>
<p>You never get to express them.</p>
<p>And if you have a more unusual fetish,</p>
<p>people usually judge you.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like this tiny little pocket of like this shame</p>
<p>thing, but it&rsquo;s so cool to me that like human brains</p>
<p>could be oriented in such a way, like wound fucking.</p>
<p>Like somebody finds that so erotic and that&rsquo;s so cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then they probably,</p>
<p>and it should be explored, like how did that come to be?</p>
<p>You mentioned that we like to construct narratives</p>
<p>that somehow was grounded in childhood,</p>
<p>but maybe it&rsquo;s genetic.</p>
<p>Maybe it has to do with, maybe you can actually form</p>
<p>and unform that fetish very quickly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>This is one of the things that I&rsquo;m researching.</p>
<p>So in the big survey that I&rsquo;m doing,</p>
<p>I asked so many questions about childhood.</p>
<p>All the ones that I think like we have common theories</p>
<p>about like, oh, are you abused?</p>
<p>Is it yelled at by a man or a woman?</p>
<p>Stuff like that.</p>
<p>Like, are you really sexually repressive?</p>
<p>You know, is it gender roles where you&rsquo;ve expected</p>
<p>to conform, a whole bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>And then I asked, you know, obviously about like</p>
<p>a massive amount of fetishes.</p>
<p>And my sample size right now is 500,000 people.</p>
<p>500,000 people.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s massive.</p>
<p>And I have to stay for all of it.</p>
<p>And the result looks like this not really correlated.</p>
<p>Nothing that I asked about in childhood,</p>
<p>nothing correlates with fetish preference later in life.</p>
<p>It does correlate with onset.</p>
<p>Lots of things that happen in childhood can like change</p>
<p>like the age at which it triggers.</p>
<p>You have so many fascinating blog posts.</p>
<p>You had a blog post, I think, on the age of fetish onset.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And like you really nicely organized it by age,</p>
<p>like reproduction as a fetish, I guess pregnancy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>At age of 17, about 16.9.</p>
<p>Toys and like anal beads is 15.5.</p>
<p>Yeah, one of the interesting things I found,</p>
<p>I mean, this data set is so huge,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s taking me a long time to go through it.</p>
<p>So this is like snippets from what I remember</p>
<p>when I was glancing through the data.</p>
<p>So this part is not rigorous,</p>
<p>but I seem to get the impression that if you are,</p>
<p>if a fetish occurs for you earlier,</p>
<p>like if it&rsquo;s much earlier onset,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more likely to report</p>
<p>being extremely interested into it.</p>
<p>So later onset means you&rsquo;re gonna be like</p>
<p>less into the fetish.</p>
<p>But if it hits earlier, it&rsquo;s like-</p>
<p>But I wonder if it passes, like is there like phases?</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t measure old fetishes at all.</p>
<p>Like no longer, right?</p>
<p>You used to, but it&rsquo;s no longer there.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>One interesting thing that I don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>is that non-cis people seem to have more correlation</p>
<p>between childhood experiences and fetishes.</p>
<p>So I was saying that there&rsquo;s no correlation</p>
<p>between childhood experiences and fetishes.</p>
<p>This holds for cis people.</p>
<p>But trans people, especially trans men,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a correlation.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean they have absolutely higher rates</p>
<p>of abuse or fetishes or anything,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just saying that like for them,</p>
<p>there does actually seem to be some sort of connection</p>
<p>between childhood experiences and sexuality later in life.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t understand why this applies to one group</p>
<p>but not the other.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a good theory for that.</p>
<p>So usually you try, like when you see something like that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll try to construct a theory and see if you can find,</p>
<p>like you keep that theory in mind,</p>
<p>like a hypothesis of why it would be,</p>
<p>and then you ask further questions to try to elaborate.</p>
<p>So can you maybe talk about the methodology</p>
<p>of how you got the 500,000?</p>
<p>Like what, like how did this come to be?</p>
<p>This might, yeah, this is,</p>
<p>I might go into way too much detail about this</p>
<p>because I thought about this so much.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m like, the question is,</p>
<p>how do you get a lot of people to take a big survey?</p>
<p>The longer the survey is, the lower the response rate.</p>
<p>And I really wanted to do one big comprehensive survey.</p>
<p>So I could like check a whole bunch of correlations</p>
<p>within it, because it&rsquo;s more annoying</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s harder to get a lot of people</p>
<p>to retake similar surveys to each other at a time.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, okay, I need to convince</p>
<p>a very large number of people</p>
<p>to take a lot of these questions.</p>
<p>And even building the questions, that was really hard</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m like, okay,</p>
<p>I need a comprehensive amount of fetishes.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t ask everybody to answer</p>
<p>for every single niche fetish.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, do you like ball gags?</p>
<p>Do you like funnel gags?</p>
<p>Do you like wife shrew gags or whatever?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s gonna finish that survey.</p>
<p>Can you define, okay, fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna ask questions.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a wife shrew?</p>
<p>But okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing the, I&rsquo;m trying to refer to like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a thing that like-</p>
<p>Different types of gags, different types, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, different.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, so what I need to do</p>
<p>is I need to ask people a question.</p>
<p>Like, are you in like bondage?</p>
<p>And if you say yes, then I&rsquo;ll go ask you</p>
<p>all the bondage questions.</p>
<p>Ah, got it.</p>
<p>Right, but then this seems simple,</p>
<p>but then it&rsquo;s just exploded because I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>how do I categorize these fetishes?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like, if you&rsquo;re into sploshing,</p>
<p>which is like, you like sitting in cakes,</p>
<p>you like getting in mud,</p>
<p>but basically like kind of messy sensory.</p>
<p>Like, is this a disgust thing?</p>
<p>Is it a humiliation thing?</p>
<p>Is it a sensory thing?</p>
<p>Like which category?</p>
<p>Anyway, so it took me like two months</p>
<p>of just agonizing over each fetish</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t want to miss a fetish.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to like have a really important thing</p>
<p>that you accidentally put in a disgust category</p>
<p>when it actually belongs in the humiliation category.</p>
<p>Well, let me think about that.</p>
<p>Because like, you&rsquo;re still catching it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just miscategorizing it.</p>
<p>Right, because if you&rsquo;re into sploshing,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, this is clearly a humiliation thing.</p>
<p>So you say, yes, I&rsquo;m into humiliation stuff.</p>
<p>And then I don&rsquo;t ask you about sploshing.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;m missing a whole data set of people</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve falsely categorized your question.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to miss stuff.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just picking what&rsquo;s less and less important to miss.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m trying to get people</p>
<p>into the right question set.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Because like, I can&rsquo;t ask you all the questions.</p>
<p>I have to ask you a couple overarching questions</p>
<p>to know what specific questions to ask you.</p>
<p>And so I have to, those overarching questions</p>
<p>have to be really, really well calibrated</p>
<p>so that I can accurately feed you</p>
<p>into the right sub part of the survey.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>And so that was extremely difficult.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m, when I&rsquo;m dealing with,</p>
<p>I think it was like 850 fetishes.</p>
<p>So I did a couple things to spot check.</p>
<p>I like, I did a couple questions where I asked,</p>
<p>like in the detailed in the survey,</p>
<p>but like also the beginning of the survey,</p>
<p>just to see like what percentage of people I was capturing.</p>
<p>But, and then, and then I scored the survey.</p>
<p>So if you take it,</p>
<p>I had other people answer preliminary surveys</p>
<p>where they gave me data about how taboo</p>
<p>the various fetishes were.</p>
<p>And then I use that data so that when you fill out</p>
<p>the survey, it&rsquo;s extremely comprehensive</p>
<p>and you get data about exactly how taboo your interests are.</p>
<p>And you get a score at the end.</p>
<p>And I give you an equivalent kinky character,</p>
<p>which I also had people write a whole bunch</p>
<p>of fictional characters and some historic ones</p>
<p>about like how kinky they were.</p>
<p>So then I matched the historic character,</p>
<p>the kinky character to your score.</p>
<p>So that makes it like more fun,</p>
<p>like gamifies it a little bit.</p>
<p>And you can, like, you can brag about like how-</p>
<p>To be able to share it with others.</p>
<p>And a lot of the characters were like goofy,</p>
<p>like, like there&rsquo;s SpongeBob and like Hitler&rsquo;s on there</p>
<p>and, you know, South Park characters.</p>
<p>What is, what is, what kink does Hitler have?</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s like, he&rsquo;s around a Marilyn Monroe,</p>
<p>which is like a slightly above average kinkyness.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>I thought there was like a two-dimensional space somehow.</p>
<p>So this is like a literally from zero to-</p>
<p>How kinky, yeah.</p>
<p>So Hitler&rsquo;s about as a Marilyn Monroe.</p>
<p>Who was the most, what&rsquo;s the character for like-</p>
<p>Willy Wonka.</p>
<p>Is the most kinky?</p>
<p>Was the most kinky, yeah.</p>
<p>I think like maybe Captain America</p>
<p>was the least kinky or something or Gandhi.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, but that&rsquo;s another conversation.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it went viral on TikTok basically.</p>
<p>Because people were like, what?</p>
<p>I got this insane character.</p>
<p>And then the sample size exploded from 40,000 to 500,000.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So like all it took is that kind of incentive?</p>
<p>Or did you like at first have to pay people</p>
<p>for the serenade?</p>
<p>No, it was just that incentive.</p>
<p>And what about the demographic</p>
<p>of the different people that took it?</p>
<p>Mostly younger.</p>
<p>So usually early twenties, predominantly female,</p>
<p>like 70% female.</p>
<p>70% female.</p>
<p>Pretty like, wraps on a TikTok demographics pretty well.</p>
<p>Okay, I got it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Young people are probably better for this kind of survey</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s probably a culture</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a little bit more honest about their sexuality.</p>
<p>Yeah, most likely.</p>
<p>I think people are incentivized to be honest</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re getting a true identity response out of it.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re doing it for money, you don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>But like if you are invested in the result,</p>
<p>you want to know what the truth of the answers are,</p>
<p>then you actually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that you also don&rsquo;t want to know the truth.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is true.</p>
<p>But on average, hopefully that doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, these are really difficult.</p>
<p>Like what, is there some interesting little quirks</p>
<p>that people should know about your methodology</p>
<p>that you had to kind of solve</p>
<p>to try to get to a really good survey?</p>
<p>So one of you said is the categorization</p>
<p>to make it more efficient.</p>
<p>Is there some for the analysis part?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the graph that you were talking about</p>
<p>is a binary.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like if you,</p>
<p>and if somebody expressed even a little bit of interest,</p>
<p>then it goes into the graph.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like 80% of people</p>
<p>expressed even a little bit of interest.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not representing degree of interest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not differentiating between them at all.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s possible that like some fetishes</p>
<p>have exactly the same amount of people</p>
<p>like are at least a little bit into them,</p>
<p>but one of them it&rsquo;s very extreme interest</p>
<p>and the other is like vague and not very intense.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not reflected.</p>
<p>I also like probably didn&rsquo;t represent</p>
<p>the visual part right.</p>
<p>Like it might not be intuitive, but.</p>
<p>So you chose a log scale,</p>
<p>but it was kind of spreads things out</p>
<p>to mix it more and more clear.</p>
<p>Cause the linear, it was just so clustered at the bottom.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t really separate it out.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s obviously a selection effects as possible</p>
<p>that like the identity results at the end</p>
<p>impacted people&rsquo;s results a little bit.</p>
<p>But the thing is like, I&rsquo;m comparing it to what exists,</p>
<p>like what is the alternative?</p>
<p>And right now the research on this stuff is terrible.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m not saying my research is perfect,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, at least it&rsquo;s something,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s pointing us</p>
<p>maybe in a direction</p>
<p>that we might be able to do more research on.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re making the data available.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing it slowly because there&rsquo;s so,</p>
<p>I ask about so many questions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like not very anonymized.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m really seeing the small sections</p>
<p>of the data at a time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Have you published in like journals and stuff?</p>
<p>No, I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Do you have any interest in that or is your approach?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m conflicted about it.</p>
<p>Like it sounds cool because then I could be like,</p>
<p>ha ha, I&rsquo;m publishing a journal.</p>
<p>People who are yelling about me</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t know anything about statistics on Twitter,</p>
<p>like that I can go like shove it in their face.</p>
<p>But then you&rsquo;re also giving into the silly criticism, right?</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t, like I want,</p>
<p>I feel so passionate about extra science,</p>
<p>like science that you can just do.</p>
<p>Like I wanna make science accessible.</p>
<p>Like anybody can just go look and learn</p>
<p>about the basics of like doing a survey</p>
<p>or figuring out how to interpret information.</p>
<p>And doing a published journal feels like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m betraying my cause a little bit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s often behind a paywall.</p>
<p>Yeah, it goes against the,</p>
<p>I mean, I think you not publishing in a journal</p>
<p>is doing a big public service.</p>
<p>Aw, I think it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve heard that.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Oh, like just coming from like on this topic,</p>
<p>the elitism I see on the psychology side</p>
<p>with the journals and the academia,</p>
<p>the positions and the institutions you come from,</p>
<p>all of that, that goes against,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s more useful for math</p>
<p>and computer science and so on,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s like clear,</p>
<p>but even then, even then,</p>
<p>code is code, data is data.</p>
<p>Like prestige shouldn&rsquo;t matter at all.</p>
<p>Maybe for like biological experiments,</p>
<p>like virology or something like that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good to be from a major lab</p>
<p>that has a reputation for like</p>
<p>going through all the procedures</p>
<p>that you know you can trust.</p>
<p>But here, like you&rsquo;re dealing</p>
<p>with a giant mess of humanity.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s beautiful to be transparent,</p>
<p>to be raw, to be exploring it together with everybody.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s really beautiful.</p>
<p>I think people like have a lot of incentive</p>
<p>to doubt the results.</p>
<p>Like a lot of the research I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>is to like cis and trans people.</p>
<p>Like we don&rsquo;t have any data about transsexuality,</p>
<p>like not very good at least.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really curious,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really have an agenda about it.</p>
<p>I think like being trans is cool.</p>
<p>If you wanna be trans, do it.</p>
<p>And like I have some skepticism about like gender theory,</p>
<p>but like it doesn&rsquo;t come down to impact</p>
<p>like the way I think trans people should be treated,</p>
<p>which I think is like treat them,</p>
<p>you know, be fucking nice and human about it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But when I&rsquo;m talking about the thing,</p>
<p>like my conclusions are that like</p>
<p>transsexuality is really unique.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like cis woman or man sexuality at all.</p>
<p>And to me, this is super cool.</p>
<p>But like a lot of people,</p>
<p>this is very politicized right now.</p>
<p>Like the data into like transsexual preferences,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s so loaded,</p>
<p>which is really sad because I am very accepting</p>
<p>of weird sexuality.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re into a weird thing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, good for you, this is super cool.</p>
<p>Like let&rsquo;s figure out how to make it</p>
<p>so that you can explore the thing you&rsquo;re into</p>
<p>without any stigma.</p>
<p>But because there&rsquo;s so much stigma</p>
<p>that like if you find that one demographic</p>
<p>is into weirder sex stuff than the other,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s hard to present that in a way</p>
<p>that people don&rsquo;t weaponize.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been really politically touchy subject here.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you do it in a way that&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not feel like it has an agenda, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just exploring.</p>
<p>Yeah, I feel pretty open to what I&rsquo;m gonna find.</p>
<p>Like I often have no idea what the data is gonna tell me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I pre-commit,</p>
<p>like, okay, I could say A, B, or C,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like down to publish any of those findings.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve put together an ask whole cart deck</p>
<p>with a lot of awesome questions to ask at a party</p>
<p>or anywhere, honestly, including on the podcast.</p>
<p>Let me ask you one from that deck.</p>
<p>Is sex really about power?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the role of power dynamics in sex?</p>
<p>Is that everything you understand?</p>
<p>Like from the survey,</p>
<p>in terms of what people are turned on by,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve talked about like the preferences</p>
<p>that women versus men have</p>
<p>for like submissiveness and dominance.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve already talked about it a little bit,</p>
<p>but like it&rsquo;s expressed more strongly.</p>
<p>I already forget the results,</p>
<p>but I feel like women have more preference to be submissive.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is one of the things that got me</p>
<p>into researching fetishes to begin with,</p>
<p>because I think I came across some data.</p>
<p>I did like a brief survey</p>
<p>where roughly around 60% of women report being submissive</p>
<p>and 40% of men report being dominant.</p>
<p>And this was really fascinating to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, why is there this gap?</p>
<p>Like, why do we not,</p>
<p>because I guess I have some priors</p>
<p>that maybe this is an evolutionary thing,</p>
<p>like the submission dominant,</p>
<p>like strong men and, you know, like women being like,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s hot, hot man.</p>
<p>You know, the men are like ravaging and stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, shouldn&rsquo;t this be in our genes?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a gap.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the gap?</p>
<p>The gap is the dominant submissive gap.</p>
<p>More women are submissive than there are dominant men.</p>
<p>Oh, wait, really?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a pretty significant gap.</p>
<p>And this is held up, like,</p>
<p>it depends on what you&rsquo;re testing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tested a bunch of things.</p>
<p>This is part of why I did this big survey.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>But it depends against, again,</p>
<p>on like what kind of dominance you&rsquo;re measuring,</p>
<p>but overall it&rsquo;s a roughly 40 to 60%.</p>
<p>So when you say there&rsquo;s not many dominant men,</p>
<p>then the meaning like they express like a desire</p>
<p>to be dominant in the relationship?</p>
<p>Or like in sexually?</p>
<p>Sexually.</p>
<p>Sexually, in bed.</p>
<p>So like if I ask questions like,</p>
<p>how much do you like being dominant in bed?</p>
<p>Like men are less likely to answer strong yes</p>
<p>to that question.</p>
<p>But if I ask, are you likely to be submissive?</p>
<p>Like women are very much yes.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s expressive?</p>
<p>Like that represents truth?</p>
<p>My guess is-</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with men?</p>
<p>So this is, I think there&rsquo;s some reflection</p>
<p>in like FetLife.</p>
<p>So FetLife is this website where people like sign up</p>
<p>and connect based on their fetishes.</p>
<p>And this is like,</p>
<p>you can kind of see it picked up in the forum posts</p>
<p>about like how like dominant men are, you know,</p>
<p>are getting laid so much and, you know,</p>
<p>submissives are always looking for a dominant.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s an unequal market.</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is great news.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what does it reflect about modern society?</p>
<p>Is there like a, is that,</p>
<p>cause you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s these trends about like decreased masculinity</p>
<p>or that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Is that similar?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying not to hold onto one theory,</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>One is possible like decreasing testosterone levels.</p>
<p>Testosterone seems to be,</p>
<p>I have a little bit of other research,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m still checking it out.</p>
<p>That seems to indicate that a higher testosterone,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more likely to be dominant.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re seeing decreased testosterone levels</p>
<p>across society,</p>
<p>where it should be seeing a greater gap.</p>
<p>This is so fascinating.</p>
<p>Once again,</p>
<p>this is like a super interesting way to look at humanity</p>
<p>cause it is such an important part of humanity.</p>
<p>And so like how many people are doing large scale research</p>
<p>like this?</p>
<p>I feel like you&rsquo;re like at the top of the world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like world-class at the top of the world</p>
<p>doing research on this stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think I might have the biggest,</p>
<p>most comprehensive fetish data set in the world right now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s epic.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really happy about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very proud.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably growing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also enabling you to establish a name</p>
<p>to where you,</p>
<p>like a prestige,</p>
<p>like a reputation to where people can go to you</p>
<p>to like trust you more and more</p>
<p>to do longer surveys perhaps,</p>
<p>like.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the data analysis afterwards</p>
<p>is very different from like the survey design itself.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m still very amateur at the data analysis.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you can always catch up on that.</p>
<p>I guess the data analysis does enable you to,</p>
<p>does teach you how to ask better questions</p>
<p>in order to understand.</p>
<p>Yes, it goes back and forth.</p>
<p>Like as I&rsquo;m looking at the data,</p>
<p>it informs the way I wanna phrase questions the next time.</p>
<p>So women are more,</p>
<p>at least in private,</p>
<p>able to say that they would like to be submissive</p>
<p>and men, even in private,</p>
<p>are not disproportionately saying</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not willing to be dominant.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s possible-</p>
<p>What the fuck?</p>
<p>If this is caused by decreasing testosterone levels,</p>
<p>then this means that we&rsquo;re probably having</p>
<p>less satisfying sex overall.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re becoming less and less sexually compatible</p>
<p>as time goes on.</p>
<p>To be fair,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that it is connected to testosterone levels.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s possible that this is just like a genetic thing.</p>
<p>Like the gay uncle theory,</p>
<p>like the ideas,</p>
<p>like maybe gay people evolved to like be sort of</p>
<p>taking themselves out of the gene pool to be assistants.</p>
<p>And like, it&rsquo;s possible that like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain percentage of men sort of like,</p>
<p>quote unquote,</p>
<p>evolved to be submissive,</p>
<p>to take themselves out of sexual competition</p>
<p>and to instead be like the monkeys</p>
<p>revolving at the edge of the pack.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s a method of survival?</p>
<p>Like, so you stay out of the competition?</p>
<p>Yeah, and I&rsquo;m like a little sus</p>
<p>about these kinds of evo psych theories.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying it because it&rsquo;s like-</p>
<p>These are different ideas that are possible.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>So yeah,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that it&rsquo;s definitely testosterone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also possible that it&rsquo;s culture.</p>
<p>People are definitely gonna bring that up.</p>
<p>Based on my survey though,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any evidence of that.</p>
<p>Like I asked about like how much pressure was put on you</p>
<p>to be, you know,</p>
<p>agentee in your childhood.</p>
<p>Like a lot of questions around this kind of thing</p>
<p>and no correlation at all to dominance.</p>
<p>Well, related to sexuality,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very uncomfortable right now,</p>
<p>but nevertheless-</p>
<p>Plow forward.</p>
<p>In a dominant fashion.</p>
<p>The blog post titled Rape Spectrum Survey Results.</p>
<p>What are the key takeaways from that survey?</p>
<p>So I did the survey when I had a friend be like,</p>
<p>hey, I had this confusing sexual experience.</p>
<p>Was it rape?</p>
<p>Like somebody kind of pressured her</p>
<p>and she eventually stopped saying it or something.</p>
<p>I was like, that&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know how people would consider this.</p>
<p>And so I put a whole bunch of different gray scenarios</p>
<p>into a survey and then asked people to rate</p>
<p>how rapey they thought that scenario was.</p>
<p>So you actually like little narratives</p>
<p>that they get to rate.</p>
<p>Like, you know, this person is on a date with this person,</p>
<p>they get drunk and the other person&rsquo;s not drunk.</p>
<p>I try to keep gender neutral names for all of them.</p>
<p>And you reduce them into a more concise description</p>
<p>of the situation?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like in this visualization,</p>
<p>we have this rape spectrum that&rsquo;s a result.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Where on top are things that are less likely</p>
<p>to be considered rape by the people that took the survey</p>
<p>and the bottom more likely.</p>
<p>The likeliest is a stranger forcibly assaults someone</p>
<p>who screams and fights the entire time.</p>
<p>That gets a hundred.</p>
<p>What do we make of something that&rsquo;s not zero?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a 12 is what?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>How are we supposed to interpret a 12 out of a hundred?</p>
<p>Extremely low.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like not zero, but it&rsquo;s just very close to it.</p>
<p>Having sex with an enthusiastic sex worker.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is a 12.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the lowest one.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a few,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just mention a few that are lower,</p>
<p>like at that level.</p>
<p>Have sex to make a partner happy in a relationship,</p>
<p>lying about wealth hobbies in order to get laid.</p>
<p>Person with Down syndrome eagerly has sex</p>
<p>with a neurotypical,</p>
<p>not revealing being transgender until after sex and so on.</p>
<p>I think you mentioned that there&rsquo;s some,</p>
<p>like that not revealing being transgender until after sex,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some differences amongst what men and women</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s still no men found more offensive</p>
<p>than women.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to, I wrote it a while ago.</p>
<p>I mean, this is nuanced and difficult, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because I think in a lot of public discourse,</p>
<p>the word rape is pretty binary.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like either is or is not rape.</p>
<p>And so you had a friend where it was like, this felt rapey.</p>
<p>Yeah, she&rsquo;s like confused about how to interpret it.</p>
<p>I think people look to the terms</p>
<p>to know how to feel about something.</p>
<p>Like, have you ever like been through an experience?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, that was weird.</p>
<p>And then you tell it to somebody else and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh my God, you were assaulted.</p>
<p>And then it totally recontextualizes</p>
<p>the thing that you&rsquo;ve experienced.</p>
<p>And I think that this is clunky with the word rape</p>
<p>because either you were raped or you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>You either like have this entire context,</p>
<p>like thrust upon you or you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re really not nuanced about it at all.</p>
<p>And so I would really like to have some sort of like,</p>
<p>oh, that was like a 30% rape you just endured.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I mean, there&rsquo;s probably other dimensions</p>
<p>about how traumatic it is,</p>
<p>how difficult it is to recover from,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, like people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a dangerous thing to assign a word to an experience,</p>
<p>like even, or to a relationship,</p>
<p>like saying a toxic relationship.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That can completely destroy your perception</p>
<p>of that relationship.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>And I remember this was the case with my childhood.</p>
<p>Like I talked about being very abusive,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve talked about how like</p>
<p>there was a good amount of meaning there</p>
<p>so that I didn&rsquo;t process it as abusive at the time.</p>
<p>I remember after I got out of that house and that culture,</p>
<p>people would tell me, oh, your childhood was really abusive.</p>
<p>And I was really confused by that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a total recontextualization of that narrative.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the things that I went through were not,</p>
<p>you know, good and virtuous and had meaning,</p>
<p>but rather these were like the result of, you know,</p>
<p>parents who didn&rsquo;t like love you enough or something.</p>
<p>And even though the concrete things that happened to me</p>
<p>did not change, like no facts shifted,</p>
<p>the fact that like the interpretation of the facts shifted</p>
<p>caused me quite a bit of distress for a long time.</p>
<p>I was like, oh my God, I&rsquo;m a traumatized, like abused person.</p>
<p>Like I went through an abusive childhood</p>
<p>and it was really hard for me, made it worse.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s crazy the power that terms have.</p>
<p>I think we didn&rsquo;t talk about this,</p>
<p>but how did you begin to overcome</p>
<p>the trauma of your childhood?</p>
<p>You mentioned LSD, so drugs are part of it.</p>
<p>Like what was the mental journey of that?</p>
<p>I was doing LSD quite a lot when I was 21, 22.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it like, by the way?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done LSD, what&rsquo;s it?</p>
<p>Very difficult to describe because it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>like it changes sort of aspects about your environment</p>
<p>that are invisible to you because they&rsquo;re so stable.</p>
<p>Is it like, if you can compare it to like psilocybin,</p>
<p>is it very different?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, it&rsquo;s like similar.</p>
<p>I forgot that you did shrooms.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, then you probably know.</p>
<p>You know, like the kind of shift that you have</p>
<p>from psilocybin to shrooms is roughly similar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like more clear, I think.</p>
<p>Shrooms is more like embodied,</p>
<p>but LSD is much more intellectual for me.</p>
<p>It strikes different people differently.</p>
<p>I prefer shrooms a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, LSD, I prefer LSD a lot.</p>
<p>Why is it not popularly take,</p>
<p>like there seems to be a negative connotation to LSD</p>
<p>because like it seems to potentially</p>
<p>have like a destructive effect.</p>
<p>Like maybe dosage is more difficult to get right</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Does this exactly, so actually,</p>
<p>a long time ago I did a survey on shrooms versus LSD.</p>
<p>So I asked people and people had slightly stronger</p>
<p>experiences on LSD overall, I remember,</p>
<p>but rated the experiences about is equally good.</p>
<p>But I think people like shrooms</p>
<p>because it feels more natural, quote unquote.</p>
<p>But I think if you like fed somebody a shroom</p>
<p>and like actually had the LSD molecule in it,</p>
<p>they would have a, they would think it felt very natural,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s besides the point.</p>
<p>I like, I think people get kind of incoherent on LSD</p>
<p>in a way that feels really alienating.</p>
<p>Like I consider LSD, my LSD use very heavy</p>
<p>to be one of the best decisions I ever made in my life,</p>
<p>but I definitely was incoherent for a lot of it.</p>
<p>Like talking about like, we&rsquo;re all one, consciousness,</p>
<p>everything is love, man, you know?</p>
<p>And people are like-</p>
<p>Why is that incoherent?</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s not incoherent,</p>
<p>but like if you go around saying everything is love,</p>
<p>people are like, this guy&rsquo;s kind of blasted out of his mind.</p>
<p>This podcast is basically your LSD driven</p>
<p>for a bunch of episodes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I get this for sure.</p>
<p>Oh, well, it&rsquo;s not just about love,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s about like talking in that way</p>
<p>about reality, about the world.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like overfitting.</p>
<p>The narratives that you make about the world</p>
<p>become really vivid.</p>
<p>And so you pattern match just really aggressively.</p>
<p>Like everything is connected</p>
<p>and you come up with these explanations for things.</p>
<p>And I think I was very fortunate.</p>
<p>So I have like this theory about psychedelics</p>
<p>where you either like belief construct or you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So you take psychedelics and it sort of like burns away</p>
<p>a lot of your belief structure.</p>
<p>And sometimes you, this happens</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>I need to like invent something to fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re like, okay, I think that maybe time is an illusion.</p>
<p>So I must now believe that like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re actually in a time loop</p>
<p>or like time travel is possible.</p>
<p>So you experience time differently</p>
<p>and then you come up with a different belief about time.</p>
<p>Whereas other people don&rsquo;t do this belief construction</p>
<p>at all, like you experience time differently</p>
<p>and you sort of let yourself not have a belief.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not like, okay.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re not developing any beliefs about time</p>
<p>in its absence.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just simply experiencing the absence</p>
<p>of the concept of time.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t have a lot of data to back this up</p>
<p>in my anecdotal experience</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve tripped out a lot of people.</p>
<p>People either tend to belief construct or they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And people who do not belief construct</p>
<p>seem to get more out of their LSD trips.</p>
<p>So if you can let a belief go</p>
<p>without building anything in its absence,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much more beneficial for you.</p>
<p>And I think I just, for some reason,</p>
<p>happen to have some brain that&rsquo;s constructed</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t get a belief construction at all.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>that belief construction is negative.</p>
<p>What, is it necessarily negative?</p>
<p>Can you elaborate on that a little bit?</p>
<p>I mean belief construction in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like not like playing with frames,</p>
<p>but rather committing to a different frame.</p>
<p>So I like being able to play with ideas</p>
<p>and be like, let&rsquo;s look at it this way or that way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re like, okay, you know what?</p>
<p>I took LSD and now I absolutely believe</p>
<p>the cops are outside.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, dude, no, you&rsquo;re just like,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t shift out of that, right?</p>
<p>Your brain needs to fill in the gap.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not allowed to have a gap.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not allowed to be flexible.</p>
<p>And again, I don&rsquo;t think this is like a personal failing</p>
<p>if any, I think this is like literally probably genetic</p>
<p>or like physical thing that&rsquo;s causing this.</p>
<p>But do you think there&rsquo;s possible beliefs</p>
<p>that are like enlightening that you can stick to,</p>
<p>like find a frame that like,</p>
<p>I guess if you don&rsquo;t believe construct</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re escaping your previous beliefs,</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t you doing like just some,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re picking up a bigger frame?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you&rsquo;re taking your beliefs as object</p>
<p>as opposed to being subject to them.</p>
<p>Ah, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it.</p>
<p>And some of that I guess is genetic</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s these categories of people,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two categories that experience LSD</p>
<p>in different ways.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re one of those that are able to just let go.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just think I had a good reaction.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of maybe the negative stereotype of LSD</p>
<p>comes from people who are belief constructing</p>
<p>or carry the belief constructing off of the LSD trip.</p>
<p>So you take LSD and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>ah, I&rsquo;m believing these insane things.</p>
<p>And people from the outside see that and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh my God, this person took LSD and became stupid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very scary.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s frame control?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s been at the core of your trauma,</p>
<p>at the core of your upbringing.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s frame control?</p>
<p>And also, sorry, frame control in general,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s part of human interaction.</p>
<p>Yeah, frame control is like a way of manipulating</p>
<p>somebody else that is non-obvious.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a negative connotation to that usually?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think maybe I chose the term kind of poorly</p>
<p>because I think to some degree people are always</p>
<p>a little bit manipulating each other.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s generally obvious.</p>
<p>For example, if I disagree with you,</p>
<p>I want you to believe what I believe.</p>
<p>But this is an obvious thing that is visible between us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an object on the table.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, here&rsquo;s the box where I want you to believe</p>
<p>what you wanna believe.</p>
<p>The disagreement box.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we&rsquo;re under a shared context where we understand</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re trying to move each other.</p>
<p>This is chill to me.</p>
<p>I think this is cool.</p>
<p>We do this all the time and it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>But frame control is the kind of thing</p>
<p>where you are trying carefully to obscure</p>
<p>the existence of that box.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, oh, the thing that I&rsquo;m doing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using tactics to try to influence what your reality is</p>
<p>without us being both aware that this is what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been assuming you&rsquo;re doing that the whole time.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I have to figure out how to read your facial expressions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still learning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s none, there&rsquo;s none.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have any?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like a, I&rsquo;m not even like a Chad GBT.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like GBT-1 with my facial expressions.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s kind of off.</p>
<p>Like this doesn&rsquo;t seem to match emotions,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of intelligent seemingly,</p>
<p>but definitely not conscious.</p>
<p>Anyway, so like a negative connotation,</p>
<p>manipulating, not being honest about the actual intentions</p>
<p>of the, of how you&rsquo;d like to control the conversation.</p>
<p>And I think there might be a naive version</p>
<p>of interpreting this where you&rsquo;re just like,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m trying to like subtly get you to believe like,</p>
<p>oh, do you really think that&rsquo;s bad though?</p>
<p>But this is not quite what I mean.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s like a couple of concrete things</p>
<p>that are signs of frame control.</p>
<p>Like one of them is pushing the painful update button,</p>
<p>which is this thing where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>hey, if you learn this, it&rsquo;s going to be really painful.</p>
<p>The truth is painful.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re realizing this thing about yourself,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna hurt.</p>
<p>And this is a sign that you&rsquo;re heading</p>
<p>in the right direction.</p>
<p>So if you frame all pain as a sign of virtue,</p>
<p>then this means that pain that&rsquo;s a resulting as damage</p>
<p>is something you&rsquo;re going to ignore.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like this, it&rsquo;s a common like cults, right?</p>
<p>This is for your own good.</p>
<p>Oh, you face of brave truth about yourself</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re like not quite as wise as I am.</p>
<p>When really your brain might be trying</p>
<p>to tell you protected things.</p>
<p>Or like another one is like finger trap beliefs</p>
<p>where the belief is constructed in such a way</p>
<p>that doubting it lends proof to the belief.</p>
<p>So very common example is like Satan.</p>
<p>Like the Christians are like,</p>
<p>Satan is going to try to make you doubt him.</p>
<p>The existence of he&rsquo;s gonna so doubt,</p>
<p>like maybe he&rsquo;s not actually real.</p>
<p>And so if you believe in Satan and then you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>okay, now I&rsquo;m having doubts, like maybe he isn&rsquo;t real.</p>
<p>This is like, oh, this is exactly</p>
<p>what I was taught to expect.</p>
<p>Like I am doubting this belief because I was told,</p>
<p>because like this is what Satan does</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s taken as evidence for it.</p>
<p>So like the attempt to move away from the belief,</p>
<p>like rebounds on you and like causes you</p>
<p>to be more embedded inside of the belief.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like techniques like these,</p>
<p>like very subtle things where like being inside</p>
<p>of this system sort of just self reinforces the system</p>
<p>is what I consider to be frame control.</p>
<p>And have you met people that are really good</p>
<p>at this kind of frame control?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>So like you&rsquo;re saying that your father was like that?</p>
<p>Yeah, to be fair, I&rsquo;m not sure he was good at it</p>
<p>because I was a kid.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s probably not very good at it actually,</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re a child being raised in a house</p>
<p>where he works from home and you&rsquo;re homeschooled,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just kind of what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>And to be fair, I do think that like strong frame control</p>
<p>is quite rare.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, most people are kind of doing something</p>
<p>like this, but not nearly to the degree</p>
<p>that it gives me the ick.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve met maybe like five or six people I think</p>
<p>who I really don&rsquo;t like because of those very subtle things</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>But I think also I&rsquo;m starting to kind of understand</p>
<p>that there is people who are narcissists and sociopaths</p>
<p>and psychopaths out there.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not even sure if people like that,</p>
<p>because I think they get good at frame control,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re aware they&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>And it makes me also nervous about myself.</p>
<p>Like, am I doing frame control?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s one of the big things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, typically people,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t think about incentive.</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t think about,</p>
<p>oh, is this person trying to do it or not?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like not the quite, not the way.</p>
<p>You have to look at what are the effects.</p>
<p>Pragmatically looking at the effects.</p>
<p>And then you also have to do that with yourself</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re having interactions with others.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like very much like, are you like,</p>
<p>how much space are you making</p>
<p>for the other person&rsquo;s reality here?</p>
<p>Like, are you giving power to the other person?</p>
<p>Because a big aspect of frame control</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re carefully rerouting the power to yourself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, I am the person who knows.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re having pain in your beliefs</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re updating towards the things that I believe.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just like a gravity well.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re setting up the gravity well</p>
<p>of your interactions such that you&rsquo;re making sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re giving the other person power</p>
<p>over the shared reality you inhabit,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a really good sign</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not doing frame control.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re making room for them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Unless we&rsquo;re talking about in bed,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s all general relativity from there</p>
<p>and black holes and stuff.</p>
<p>Frame control, bed frame control.</p>
<p>Bed frame control.</p>
<p>It took me a long time to get a bed frame.</p>
<p>Just, I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>I know, but you wear a suit though.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So frame control in the streets, no frame in the sheets.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the funny thing is to say there,</p>
<p>but there you have it.</p>
<p>So the LSD helped you escape the frame of,</p>
<p>can you like elaborate what was the frame</p>
<p>that was holding you back from,</p>
<p>like the frame constructed by your childhood experience</p>
<p>that was holding you back as an intellectual,</p>
<p>as a thinker, as a free being in this world?</p>
<p>Well, I was really fucked up.</p>
<p>Like after I left home and I absorbed</p>
<p>the external narrative that I had been abused,</p>
<p>which technically is true.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying I wasn&rsquo;t, but like I absorbed this narrative</p>
<p>and I just remember having like this burning coals</p>
<p>in my chest at all times.</p>
<p>Like if I had to call out of my factory work</p>
<p>when Father&rsquo;s Day happened</p>
<p>because I was spending the whole day sobbing</p>
<p>because everybody&rsquo;s talking about their fathers.</p>
<p>Like I was really messed up</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s because I held this important thing,</p>
<p>this idea, this frame that I had been deeply wronged.</p>
<p>Like there was a correct way of being</p>
<p>and the world had violated that.</p>
<p>Something should not have happened.</p>
<p>Like my father should have loved me.</p>
<p>And it was like this shearing in the nature of reality</p>
<p>and that was really agonizing to have.</p>
<p>And LSD really messes with frames a lot.</p>
<p>It takes like what you think is normal</p>
<p>and really screws with it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d done LSD like several times before,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s one LSD trip where I went through</p>
<p>my entire childhood in my head.</p>
<p>Because LSD like really makes your memories quite vivid.</p>
<p>Like anything you visualize, it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re in it.</p>
<p>And so I just went and very carefully, deliberately</p>
<p>went and remembered every single memory that I could have</p>
<p>that was really painful for me.</p>
<p>Like the times that I lost friends</p>
<p>and all the things I valued and like being broken</p>
<p>because like my parents,</p>
<p>especially my dad would refer to like breaking me,</p>
<p>like explicitly, we&rsquo;re going to break your will.</p>
<p>And so all these times where I was like,</p>
<p>they had successfully broken my will over and over</p>
<p>and it was horrible.</p>
<p>I was just like sobbing, tears streaming down my face.</p>
<p>And then I like worked through my whole childhood.</p>
<p>I got to the end and I&rsquo;m going to tear up</p>
<p>because every time I talk about this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like the sensation of like being free</p>
<p>from that for the first time is so incredible.</p>
<p>Like I remember being outside of my house</p>
<p>and being able to like go where I wanted</p>
<p>and think what I wanted.</p>
<p>And it was just so blissful.</p>
<p>And I was soaked in this gratitude on this trip,</p>
<p>just like vibrating with complete joy for everything.</p>
<p>I was just looking around like I could touch anything.</p>
<p>I could cry if I wanted to.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to cry.</p>
<p>I was not to be depressed.</p>
<p>I was trying to, I got depressed as a child</p>
<p>and my parents were like, if you keep being depressed,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to like force you to scrub the whole house.</p>
<p>Like just like the ability to have a feeling</p>
<p>was so thrilling.</p>
<p>And I was so grateful for this.</p>
<p>I was like, I would do anything</p>
<p>to give this experience to someone else.</p>
<p>I would do anything,</p>
<p>even if it was like putting them through what I went through.</p>
<p>And then like with that realization,</p>
<p>I was like, oh, it was worth it.</p>
<p>The thing that I went through was worth it for this.</p>
<p>I would do it again</p>
<p>to like be able to have this deep gratitude</p>
<p>for what I have now.</p>
<p>And then that shifted the meaning frame</p>
<p>because before the meaning had been like</p>
<p>something had sheared,</p>
<p>something that shouldn&rsquo;t have happened.</p>
<p>But now it was like the exact right thing had happened.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost a gift.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was like, ah, I would not give up my childhood.</p>
<p>I would do it again.</p>
<p>And I believe that to this day.</p>
<p>For the moment of discovering that freedom.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because like everything now,</p>
<p>my whole life is in contrast to that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fucking great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really thrilled about it.</p>
<p>Is this the part of you that hates your father still?</p>
<p>Kind of, like I don&rsquo;t want a relationship with him anymore.</p>
<p>After that, there was some forgiveness.</p>
<p>Like I had this burning,</p>
<p>I would have nightmares about him killing me or something.</p>
<p>And after that, it kind of stopped.</p>
<p>Like the fire in my chest</p>
<p>went away permanently after that trip.</p>
<p>It was so fast.</p>
<p>It was like before I was fucked up,</p>
<p>after that trip, I woke up the next day and I was clean.</p>
<p>It was really severe.</p>
<p>And I definitely don&rsquo;t want to be around him still.</p>
<p>Like he still like triggers the fear in my body,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t have that hang up anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like kind of, I&rsquo;m over it.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve let go.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s his own person.</p>
<p>Like ultimately he didn&rsquo;t get to decide who he was</p>
<p>in the same way that I didn&rsquo;t get to decide who I was.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s almost like a kind of,</p>
<p>at least intellectual, like forgiveness you have for him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that, so that trip just took you through your whole,</p>
<p>were you alone by the way, when you&rsquo;re doing the trip?</p>
<p>Yeah, I had roommates, but the trip was mostly alone.</p>
<p>I had somebody else who was like sitting in the room,</p>
<p>but they weren&rsquo;t interacting with me.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re sitting there experiencing all of this.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the timeline?</p>
<p>Like how long does it take</p>
<p>to go through your whole childhood?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>I mean, time&rsquo;s really messed up when you do that.</p>
<p>I was listening to the soundtrack of The Fountain,</p>
<p>which is excellent.</p>
<p>I listen to that a lot when I did LSD.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s probably a couple of hours.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, it would be,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like a vivid experience of your childhood.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Moment by moment, trauma by trauma.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s good to experience it purely.</p>
<p>Like it just is what it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just is grief.</p>
<p>Like it is loss and you just are in it</p>
<p>without having to make it be anything.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so interesting that you can,</p>
<p>I mean, work through that.</p>
<p>So for a lot of us, for a lot of human beings,</p>
<p>like childhood is full of those kind of mini traumas,</p>
<p>big or small.</p>
<p>And like working through that,</p>
<p>it feels like what a lot of life is about</p>
<p>is trying to work through that.</p>
<p>And it feels like you have to kind of relive it.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s what therapy is about in part,</p>
<p>be able to vocalize it.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is why I feel really confused</p>
<p>about the concept of trauma.</p>
<p>Like people use this word so much,</p>
<p>like are you traumatized?</p>
<p>And I understand why, like this is why I feel confused</p>
<p>about it, but part of me is like,</p>
<p>I wonder if by using that term,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re creating the trauma in people.</p>
<p>They were using the frame where the thing that happened</p>
<p>to you was not supposed to happen.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, maybe there needs to be a different frame.</p>
<p>No, I agree with you totally.</p>
<p>I just, I&rsquo;ve made friends with and talked to</p>
<p>this guy named Paul Conti.</p>
<p>He wrote a book on trauma.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an incredible, brilliant psychiatrist.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s probably agrees with you kind of.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>I should read it.</p>
<p>Yeah, you should.</p>
<p>Maybe even talk to him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a fascinating human being.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be interested in the,</p>
<p>a psychiatrist perspective is really interesting</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;ve been doing kind of an in-person survey</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve done so many patients.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s, like just talking to him is fascinating</p>
<p>because like if I describe my experience</p>
<p>as somebody else&rsquo;s experience,</p>
<p>I could see his brain mapping it in interesting ways</p>
<p>to the tens of thousands of like data points</p>
<p>he has in his head.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, of course that&rsquo;s what doctors do,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s cool when the doctor&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>the doctor of the mind.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>Have like an actual, like qualitative data.</p>
<p>And be able to, I mean,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the poetic stuff comes in.</p>
<p>Ultimately as a psychiatrist,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re exploring the human mind</p>
<p>with a bit of a sort of romantic element.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t be really systematic about it.</p>
<p>But it does seem like, frame or not,</p>
<p>be able to just talk through the experiences you had</p>
<p>is really powerful.</p>
<p>What about it is appealing?</p>
<p>Is it just like being able to revisit it with new eyes?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t know exactly.</p>
<p>It just seems to work for people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s appealing.</p>
<p>It just seems like almost acknowledging to yourself</p>
<p>that things happen.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve said, I think I&rsquo;ve said this before.</p>
<p>My brother, who I love very much,</p>
<p>tried to set me on fire a few times.</p>
<p>And I think, to me, it&rsquo;s funny,</p>
<p>but I wonder if I didn&rsquo;t talk about it,</p>
<p>like if that would be traumatic,</p>
<p>maybe like talking and laughing about it.</p>
<p>Because it was traumatic to me at the time.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>I was like, I love you.</p>
<p>Why are you setting me on fire?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s what kids do when they&rsquo;re like young.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>How would you do this?</p>
<p>I was like, whatever, fine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what boys do.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re crazy.</p>
<p>It makes total sense.</p>
<p>It was probably funny from his perspective.</p>
<p>But yeah, I wonder.</p>
<p>I want to bring that to the surface, if that helps.</p>
<p>And maybe LSD allows you to,</p>
<p>or different drugs, depending on the person,</p>
<p>allows you to more vividly bring it to the surface.</p>
<p>And then, depending on your genetics,</p>
<p>be able to find a better frame.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Human mind is freaking fascinating.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s romantic to you, by the way?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big romance person.</p>
<p>What is?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not like, so to you, romantic is like</p>
<p>objective analysis of the interactions between humans?</p>
<p>A little bit.</p>
<p>Like I do find kind of the survey process</p>
<p>that I did to be romantic.</p>
<p>When I, the guy that I asked out who I&rsquo;m still dating,</p>
<p>I was like, hey, you scored really high on my survey.</p>
<p>You want to like go eat food or something?</p>
<p>And his response was like,</p>
<p>you want to try doing three days in an Airbnb</p>
<p>as our first date?</p>
<p>And I was like, yeah.</p>
<p>And that was romantic.</p>
<p>Like the bold leap into a really intense date.</p>
<p>I think you mentioned something also,</p>
<p>must have been a tweet or something like that,</p>
<p>where if people want you to show up to a thing,</p>
<p>give like the time, the location, the dress code,</p>
<p>and no pressure for you to be there,</p>
<p>but like show up if you want.</p>
<p>That was your specification.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great memory, yeah.</p>
<p>And then I think you said that you did that</p>
<p>for like some castle in South of France.</p>
<p>I did, yeah.</p>
<p>I was in my early 20s.</p>
<p>People, my friends at home were taking prediction markets</p>
<p>on whether or not I was going to get abducted and killed.</p>
<p>Yeah, what was that like?</p>
<p>I mean, what, you&rsquo;ve traveled quite a bit.</p>
<p>Like, do you take these giant risks?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s with that?</p>
<p>I think I used to more when I was younger with the traveling.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m like a little traveled out now,</p>
<p>but like my first one,</p>
<p>I moved out of Idaho for the first time.</p>
<p>I moved to Australia.</p>
<p>Just kind of yeeted myself across the globe.</p>
<p>So which verb did you just use?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like yeet, to yote, yatted, yeet.</p>
<p>So do people, is this like slang?</p>
<p>Is this like Urban Dictionary, or is this actual,</p>
<p>or is this Webster?</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to like feel into the word.</p>
<p>Like if you take a thing</p>
<p>and you just like curl it really hard,</p>
<p>it does not feel like a yeet motion.</p>
<p>Okay, so you yeeted.</p>
<p>So it was aggressive.</p>
<p>So across the globe, you didn&rsquo;t even stop in.</p>
<p>I just hurled myself, yeah.</p>
<p>Literally along the way.</p>
<p>I just kept yeeting myself in various places, yeah.</p>
<p>And so at one point I was on OkCupid</p>
<p>and somebody sent me a long message</p>
<p>being like, you should come.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m hosting a castle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some people that I met.</p>
<p>I was like, I have no idea who you are,</p>
<p>but I just bought a plane ticket.</p>
<p>And you just went.</p>
<p>And it was life-changing.</p>
<p>I ended up dating that guy for years</p>
<p>and he changed my life quite a bit</p>
<p>because he like was very agency in the world.</p>
<p>And before that, I wasn&rsquo;t agency.</p>
<p>Agency, like, can we?</p>
<p>So it sounds like you were,</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t you have to express agency</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re yeeting yourself across the world?</p>
<p>Yeah, but only a little bit.</p>
<p>Like in the same way you express agency when you eat LSD.</p>
<p>Like the only thing you actually do in eating LSD</p>
<p>is like put the tab in your mouth</p>
<p>and then you just kind of scream the whole way after that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of other things.</p>
<p>Like I didn&rsquo;t feel powerful enough</p>
<p>to like go make events happen or anything.</p>
<p>This guy, he had a lot of agency</p>
<p>in the sense that he would just sort of create realities</p>
<p>through the people around him.</p>
<p>Be like, okay, we&rsquo;re gonna do this startup</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re going to throw this incredible event.</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s just do it.</p>
<p>And it would somehow happen.</p>
<p>And it was really cool to see that.</p>
<p>And so that one thing led to another</p>
<p>and it was one of the biggest impacts on my life, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s pretty bold.</p>
<p>I would say that&rsquo;s pretty romantic.</p>
<p>South of France?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, it was.</p>
<p>In a little castle.</p>
<p>It was in the winter.</p>
<p>We were all cozyed up by the fire.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m jumping around here.</p>
<p>Twitter poll, have you ever hitchhiked?</p>
<p>You posted this Twitter poll.</p>
<p>Out of all, that was a big list of Twitter polls.</p>
<p>Why did you pick the hitchhiking one?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, because it&rsquo;s relevant to traveling.</p>
<p>And I like that one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s romantic too, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually terrified of hitchhiking,</p>
<p>but I have done it a little bit.</p>
<p>Oh, so it&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not romantic to you.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re terrified of what?</p>
<p>Oh, so you are terrified of-</p>
<p>Interacting with strangers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you go to South of France.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But that was like a cohesive thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It made sense somehow.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like times where you&rsquo;re allowed to be weird</p>
<p>and times where you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>And like, if you&rsquo;re-</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s allowing you?</p>
<p>He had some vague rigor of society.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But some people are like, hey, we think you&rsquo;re cool.</p>
<p>Come to this party.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, all right, I&rsquo;m allowed to come to this party</p>
<p>and be really weird.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re being picked up by a hitchhiker,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to want to make small talk</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t be weird</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re going to kick you out.</p>
<p>I kind of think,</p>
<p>because Valentine&rsquo;s day is coming up,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of think it&rsquo;s doing something crazy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>South of France sounds nice.</p>
<p>You gotta like,</p>
<p>you gotta go to like a crazy romantic date</p>
<p>with a woman you don&rsquo;t know at all.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think I would like tweet something</p>
<p>and just like, how do I select randomly, basically?</p>
<p>How do you select totally randomly?</p>
<p>Like not people from your audience?</p>
<p>No, you want, no, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>From the audience, but in an interesting way.</p>
<p>So random amongst good choices.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t you have people just like submit a form</p>
<p>and then you just randomize it and then select one?</p>
<p>And then you just, if it&rsquo;s terrible,</p>
<p>you just go randomize it again.</p>
<p>Like the first not terrible option.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Somebody&rsquo;s like drown yourself.</p>
<p>But I feel like then it&rsquo;s no longer random.</p>
<p>You kind of want to do random.</p>
<p>You just do it and just do it.</p>
<p>If I cross the world somewhere in some random place,</p>
<p>just for like a single event, for like a dinner.</p>
<p>You got some sort of itch in you.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I mean, yeah, the itch to live.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s nice to drop a little chaos into a thing.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your chaos survey, by the way?</p>
<p>Like you mentioned that earlier.</p>
<p>I kind of saw it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s one of the sort of artistic attempts</p>
<p>at a survey.</p>
<p>Because you know, at least from what I understand,</p>
<p>the big five and the way that they used to do IQ tests,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard is that they do factor analysis,</p>
<p>you know, where they ask a whole bunch of questions</p>
<p>and then they run calculations on the data</p>
<p>to like sort of group it by organic clusters.</p>
<p>So like with the big five,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like people who say, oh, I like to be at parties.</p>
<p>They also tend to say yes to the questions.</p>
<p>Like I like being the center of attention.</p>
<p>And so you notice that like there&rsquo;s a cluster of ways</p>
<p>that people are answering the question</p>
<p>and then you can sort of pull out an organic spectrum.</p>
<p>And so I was like, okay, we&rsquo;ve done that a whole bunch</p>
<p>with things like personality or like romantic stuff.</p>
<p>Like I did it with the rape spectrum survey.</p>
<p>But like what happens if you apply that method</p>
<p>to a completely unselected group of questions?</p>
<p>Just like no random chaotic, no thing whatsoever.</p>
<p>Like what happens is if you ask all possible questions,</p>
<p>what natural things evolve out of that natural spectrums?</p>
<p>So I had other people submit questions</p>
<p>for a very large survey.</p>
<p>And I took the first, I think 1100</p>
<p>and barely filtered them at all.</p>
<p>And then I just had a whole bunch of people answer them.</p>
<p>Can you give like a hint to what it looks like?</p>
<p>Like what, like how crazy did the question get?</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of them were standard,</p>
<p>but somebody was like, if Beelzebub like did something</p>
<p>in 1512 to like turn the world over, would you like it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say it was really just insane questions.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a couple of those.</p>
<p>A lot of like, would you fuck Ayla ones,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know, it was all across the spectrum.</p>
<p>A lot of would you fuck Ayla.</p>
<p>Yeah, I had to produce duplicate.</p>
<p>Oh, a lot of the same question.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ones, okay, I got you.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it was really all,</p>
<p>it was like normal personal habits.</p>
<p>It was, you know, romantic preferences</p>
<p>or political preferences, personality stuff,</p>
<p>like random opinions about media.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see those actual questions,</p>
<p>but because your audience is probably</p>
<p>really super interesting minds.</p>
<p>Okay, you mentioned body count.</p>
<p>You said you can answer that one easily.</p>
<p>Do you share your body count?</p>
<p>Do you know your body count?</p>
<p>Do you know, is there a spreadsheet?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a spreadsheet, yes.</p>
<p>Is it Google Sheets?</p>
<p>Is it Excel? It&rsquo;s Google Sheets, yeah.</p>
<p>Have you run like, is there,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to share the contents,</p>
<p>but is there like data on each?</p>
<p>So I track paid clients and free sex separately.</p>
<p>And I track different things on either of them.</p>
<p>Like with clients, I track like positions we used</p>
<p>and who had an orgasm.</p>
<p>And with personal people,</p>
<p>I just track basically like age, city, you know, name.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had sex with I think 42 people, I think, for free.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sharing this because I want people to calibrate.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not like huge, it&rsquo;s not like tiny.</p>
<p>One of the people I&rsquo;ve recently talked to, Mel,</p>
<p>Destiny&rsquo;s, Steven&rsquo;s wife, is a huge fan of yours.</p>
<p>She was actually really excited to get to talk to you,</p>
<p>but I think she said her body count is more than 42.</p>
<p>I think she said 60, something like this.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>because she was like saying like,</p>
<p>she loves like looking at your work, talking to you,</p>
<p>because you have similar perspectives on the world.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really refreshing, it&rsquo;s liberating.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>That was really sweet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So is there like an optimal body count?</p>
<p>If you were to map, I wonder, yeah,</p>
<p>what have you found out about body count and doing?</p>
<p>Have you actually done surveys on body count?</p>
<p>Like on how many people-</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t collected that information on my last survey.</p>
<p>I just haven&rsquo;t looked at it yet.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just so many things to look at, so I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But I think if I&rsquo;m sleeping with a guy</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s had sex with more than 120 people,</p>
<p>then I start to get a little bit wary.</p>
<p>Why 120 as opposed to 100?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I just like kind of skimmed through the numbers in my head</p>
<p>and picked one that felt right.</p>
<p>Just now?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>120?</p>
<p>Ish.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s when I&rsquo;m starting like-</p>
<p>Ish, so you&rsquo;re flexible.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m flexible, very.</p>
<p>But 200 is a hard line for sure.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s, you know, we have to-</p>
<p>Depends, the factors.</p>
<p>Cause like there&rsquo;s a level of body count</p>
<p>at which you start to wonder if how much</p>
<p>like accidental misrepresentation a guy is doing to you.</p>
<p>Oh, like if you&rsquo;re saying 200, that might be dishonest.</p>
<p>No, like if he&rsquo;s had sex with 200 girls,</p>
<p>this means that he&rsquo;s had a lot of casual sex</p>
<p>and not a lot of like long-term relationships,</p>
<p>assuming that he&rsquo;s, you know, hasn&rsquo;t been super poly.</p>
<p>And this usually means that there has to be some sort of</p>
<p>like indication that he cares about the girl</p>
<p>more than he actually does.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s like leading you on, basically.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m not saying this is necessarily the case.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying like at a certain level of number,</p>
<p>I start to become,</p>
<p>I start to wonder if this is what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Is there like, from your understanding of it,</p>
<p>is there a different perception between men and women?</p>
<p>Like if you look at the high body count for a woman</p>
<p>versus a high body count for a man,</p>
<p>like how society views it?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, people are way more judgmental of women.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t experienced this personally in my circles</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m in very sex-friendly circles.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m in orgy circles where everybody like</p>
<p>dates the same women and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>woo, good job.</p>
<p>But yeah, people are much more,</p>
<p>like people always tell me online,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re not ever gonna be able to find a husband</p>
<p>because you have sex with too many people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very common, which I don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>I mean, like men are also perceived negatively</p>
<p>if you have high body count,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s negatively in the same way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s unethical to lie about your body count?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So all lying is unethical?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of lying in general.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Body count is an interesting one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so silly to take that, to care about that,</p>
<p>but still we do.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Jealousy is silly, but still we get jealous.</p>
<p>Is that weird?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, the thing is like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like viewing emotions as like irrational,</p>
<p>even if they are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, emotions are always there for a reason.</p>
<p>And people don&rsquo;t like high body counts for a reason too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just fine and valid.</p>
<p>Yeah, it also is like,</p>
<p>yeah, I don&rsquo;t know what I make of just the past of like time.</p>
<p>You know, like,</p>
<p>like each human is a collection of experiences</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know most of those experiences.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden you meet this bag of experiences.</p>
<p>And like, what are you supposed to do</p>
<p>with both of your like training data?</p>
<p>Are you supposed to like, like what?</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know if we,</p>
<p>like part of me wants to not actually ever talk about it,</p>
<p>to care at all.</p>
<p>Like, why does it matter?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s only the future that matters.</p>
<p>And yet the past also matters a lot potentially,</p>
<p>but maybe not really.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re somehow like constructed from that past,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re no longer that past.</p>
<p>It sounds like you&rsquo;re evaluating</p>
<p>for something different than most people.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Like, the reason-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just talking out my ass, but yes, go ahead.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m just saying crazy shit,</p>
<p>like as if I&rsquo;m on drugs, but I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>I think this is like kind of like lining up</p>
<p>with like this caricature that I&rsquo;m building of you</p>
<p>based on this conversation so far.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>That like a lot of people want to know</p>
<p>about your past because they want to know</p>
<p>how useful and compatible you are with them.</p>
<p>Like, oh, do you have a similar job?</p>
<p>You know, do you have similar culture?</p>
<p>Like, what can I expect from you in the future?</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s very practically oriented.</p>
<p>Whereas like, if the thing that you&rsquo;re focused on</p>
<p>is not like being able to predict someone,</p>
<p>like if the thing that you&rsquo;re focused on</p>
<p>is a present moment,</p>
<p>then it doesn&rsquo;t really matter anymore.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the things that, like they&rsquo;re training data.</p>
<p>But I also think that the past</p>
<p>is not that predictive of the future.</p>
<p>Is it not?</p>
<p>Not if you believe in the power</p>
<p>of the interaction between two humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like nature versus nurture.</p>
<p>I guess also I don&rsquo;t believe in the ability</p>
<p>of people to accurately describe their own past.</p>
<p>This is true.</p>
<p>Because they have a very specific lens through it</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily, like it&rsquo;s too biased.</p>
<p>But you can also interpret based on the bias.</p>
<p>Like if somebody describes their own past,</p>
<p>you can kind of pick up like-</p>
<p>Hard, it&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>Like you could, if you&rsquo;re a therapist,</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;re really drilling, like, or whatever, sorry.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re really investigating and like analyzing it,</p>
<p>but then it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a different kind of relationship, right?</p>
<p>Is it that hard though?</p>
<p>Like if I&rsquo;m with a guy and I&rsquo;m considering dating him</p>
<p>and I ask, like, how did your past relationships end?</p>
<p>And then if all of them were like,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, oh, she was crazy.</p>
<p>And my other one that she went crazy too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, like there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re talking about all of your exes is insane, like-</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s an easy level of red flag.</p>
<p>But I feel like the more that,</p>
<p>also it&rsquo;s possible that we&rsquo;re crazy</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s attracted to crazy people.</p>
<p>So like, but I would say that&rsquo;s like easy level,</p>
<p>easy level Mario Kart video game versus like Elden Ring.</p>
<p>Like I think most people&rsquo;s past is like complicated.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty good bird.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I do agree that like, there&rsquo;s a level of obfuscation, wow,</p>
<p>that is hard to see through.</p>
<p>But just like a little bit sometimes.</p>
<p>Well, I tend to like with people,</p>
<p>I tend to, in general, just human interaction,</p>
<p>I tend to not talk about their past very much</p>
<p>because it allows you to focus on like,</p>
<p>I feel like the past is kind of like talking</p>
<p>about the weather is a crutch for me personally.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>Like as opposed to exploring the ideas in their mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, I see.</p>
<p>Is it like, I get really annoyed when people</p>
<p>quote philosophers when they&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to talk about philosophy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is it like that?</p>
<p>A little, but that crutch is useful and it&rsquo;s kind of sexy.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s kind of like cool.</p>
<p>Like, because it&rsquo;s nice to quote,</p>
<p>because a good quote allows you to be cheesier</p>
<p>than you otherwise would be.</p>
<p>Okay, well, if you&rsquo;re doing it to be cheesy, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Not cheesy, but not, no, no, not cheesy,</p>
<p>but to be like, it allows you to say a simple,</p>
<p>profound thing that we&rsquo;re too afraid to say</p>
<p>with our own words.</p>
<p>So like, the quoting philosophers in that sense is,</p>
<p>yeah, but it&rsquo;s still a crutch, yes.</p>
<p>But I feel like the past is more like</p>
<p>talking about your dreams.</p>
<p>It just is not, it&rsquo;s a crutch that doesn&rsquo;t care,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t empathize with the other person&rsquo;s experience</p>
<p>of the conversation or the explanations.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really convey the-</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not involved in your past.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So how do you feel about this conversation</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re asking me about my past?</p>
<p>And I talked about my past a lot.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m okay asking about your past</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve really carefully thought</p>
<p>about that aspect of it.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t really talk about your past</p>
<p>outside of the things you&rsquo;ve written about</p>
<p>and have really thought about.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s, like, with most conversation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll start talking about past stuff that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>like, the stuff that&rsquo;s actually bothering you,</p>
<p>you still probably have not written a blog post about,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s probably still stuff,</p>
<p>like, maybe it&rsquo;s more recent, like, the last few months,</p>
<p>the last couple of years.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s usually what will come up with conversation.</p>
<p>And just, it&rsquo;s good, it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not as deep,</p>
<p>and I would say it&rsquo;s not as intimate</p>
<p>as talking about the actual ideas in your mind.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>And how you interact with the world.</p>
<p>So, like, the past is interesting for the frame of, like,</p>
<p>sort of like the, like, I guess you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I guess we&rsquo;re talking a lot about, like, narrative.</p>
<p>Yeah. And past.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I like the ideas in people&rsquo;s minds</p>
<p>versus their recollections and memories and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What do you think about porn?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice, I like it.</p>
<p>Okay, you like it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What effect do you think it has on society?</p>
<p>Like, probably reduces rates of rape.</p>
<p>Because, like, really horny men get an outlet</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a real life woman.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, what about, like, the,</p>
<p>I mean, like I said, I finished reading Brave New World.</p>
<p>Like, the over-sexualization,</p>
<p>does it increase, like, the sexualization of society</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not, to a degree, that&rsquo;s not good?</p>
<p>Or is this good?</p>
<p>Like, does it alter in a negative direction</p>
<p>our relationship with sex?</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s unclear?</p>
<p>Like, it might.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to evaluate this thing, right?</p>
<p>Because this is, like, one of those really charged things</p>
<p>where, like, I kind of don&rsquo;t trust anybody&rsquo;s arguments</p>
<p>on it because it&rsquo;s too charged.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another question, which is, like,</p>
<p>is it a net positive or net negative?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s possible that it might be, like,</p>
<p>a net negative for, specifically, our relationship to sex,</p>
<p>but, like, a net positive overall, in general?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>The thing, my guess is that, in general,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s better to let people do the thing</p>
<p>that feels good to them,</p>
<p>and then the environment will naturally modify</p>
<p>to fit this thing.</p>
<p>And then if we have more needs in response to that,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re gonna figure out a way</p>
<p>to take care of those needs.</p>
<p>So, like, if you&rsquo;re watching a bunch of porn</p>
<p>and this makes you, like,</p>
<p>not want to go have sex with women,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re gonna have to, like,</p>
<p>change the way that we, like, experience IRL connection.</p>
<p>To compete with porn?</p>
<p>Yeah, which seems like a natural evolution</p>
<p>of, like, the civilizational cycle.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m pro-natural evolution.</p>
<p>And, like, instead of trying to stop things</p>
<p>that people want to do naturally,</p>
<p>we figure out how to integrate that</p>
<p>and, like, find a more healthy outlet.</p>
<p>But you have to then be first honest</p>
<p>with the effects that porn has.</p>
<p>So, like, is it a negative thing?</p>
<p>Is it a positive thing in real life,</p>
<p>sex interaction?</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re gonna have that more and more</p>
<p>with, like, porn in VR,</p>
<p>or maybe porn, AI porn.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, is that a bad thing?</p>
<p>Like, what if porn with AI,</p>
<p>or even, like, in physical space, like sex robots,</p>
<p>like, what if that&rsquo;s more pleasurable</p>
<p>in a bunch of different dimensions</p>
<p>than with other humans?</p>
<p>Then we should figure out artificial wombs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Like, how important is sex for society, I guess,</p>
<p>between two humans?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, like, we&rsquo;re having less sex</p>
<p>and making fewer babies.</p>
<p>And that seems, like, probably not great.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, with the babies one.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But the babies, there&rsquo;s probably artificial ways</p>
<p>to have babies that we can figure out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Then how important is sex to being human?</p>
<p>I guess sex with other humans.</p>
<p>Like, we&rsquo;re gonna have to figure that out in the century.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know what it means to, like, be human.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty on the transhumanist side of things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, like, happy to stop being human.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re okay if, like, the century&rsquo;s the last time</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be something like these biological bags of meat</p>
<p>that we are?</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s become something new and cooler.</p>
<p>Even though that thing will be way cooler than you?</p>
<p>Well, I would like to, I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that we get to be immortal.</p>
<p>Ah, it&rsquo;ll take you along for the ride.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m hoping.</p>
<p>I mean, like, it&rsquo;ll clone my,</p>
<p>I would like to do cryonics,</p>
<p>or you get frozen when you die.</p>
<p>Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>I mean, yes and no.</p>
<p>I, like, came to terms with death with my LSD use,</p>
<p>but I still have, like, press breaks</p>
<p>when the red light happens.</p>
<p>I think this is a poll you&rsquo;ve asked,</p>
<p>or this might be one of the questions in your cards,</p>
<p>but how many years would you like to live?</p>
<p>Like, if you had to pick.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s not gonna run.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really hard one.</p>
<p>Maybe, like, a million?</p>
<p>But you have to, like, I think the way,</p>
<p>this must have been a Twitter poll.</p>
<p>I forget where I saw it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a poll, and also in the deck of cards,</p>
<p>the ask poll, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, like, you have to pick that number of years,</p>
<p>and you have to live that many years,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t live anymore.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t die sooner, I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>A million years?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like that question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>I know I ask that question to a lot of people,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t like answering it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really difficult.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the downside of a million years?</p>
<p>I mean, maybe you wanna die sooner than that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I guess I would rather wait to see</p>
<p>if AI kills us all in the next 10 years,</p>
<p>and if it doesn&rsquo;t, that I&rsquo;d like to maybe</p>
<p>make it a million years.</p>
<p>Yeah, but can&rsquo;t it torture you for, like, a million years?</p>
<p>What if you&rsquo;re the last human left?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>The thought of civilization ending</p>
<p>and then just floating in space alone is kind of shitty.</p>
<p>No, no, being tortured.</p>
<p>Just imagine, today you&rsquo;re tortured.</p>
<p>Tomorrow you&rsquo;re tortured.</p>
<p>The day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>For some reason, it&rsquo;s not that scary.</p>
<p>Torture for a million years?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I just assume you&rsquo;d get used to it.</p>
<p>But maybe if they reset your memory so it was on a loop,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re just always experiencing torture</p>
<p>for the first time.</p>
<p>Yeah, hence torture.</p>
<p>Torture&rsquo;s supposed to be unpleasant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure AI will be very creative</p>
<p>in figuring out how to torture you.</p>
<p>I think I would go on the safe side.</p>
<p>I would just, like, 150 years.</p>
<p>Really, 150, though?</p>
<p>That feels like right in the uncanny valley.</p>
<p>Well, you picked 120 for body count,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m picking 150.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pumping you by 30.</p>
<p>The uncanny valley.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, probably everybody that you grew up with</p>
<p>is gonna be dead.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just enough for everybody you know to die.</p>
<p>Like, one cycle.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then start dating the next generation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And then, so you get sort of two lifetimes?</p>
<p>Yeah, two lifetimes.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it also really depends on</p>
<p>if other people get this feature.</p>
<p>Yeah, assume they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ll have, like, FOMO for sure</p>
<p>for the people who picked 300 years.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Or not, or the other, man, regret?</p>
<p>Another human thing.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re, like, what does transhumanism mean</p>
<p>to you in general?</p>
<p>So extension of life, extension of what it means</p>
<p>to be a living, conscious being?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re all for it, whatever that means.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t, I never really thought about</p>
<p>the term transhumanism for a long,</p>
<p>like, people say you&rsquo;re transhuman,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t really care.</p>
<p>But I slowly realized that my attitude is, in fact,</p>
<p>at least the thing that I&rsquo;m conceiving of as transhumanist.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m very happy to do artificial wounds</p>
<p>and, you know, upload our brains to the great collective</p>
<p>and whatever.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the thing that I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>oh, what about, like, the true organic humanness</p>
<p>that makes us who we are?</p>
<p>Like, whatever that soul of humanity,</p>
<p>I have no attachment to it at all,</p>
<p>which I think is what I&rsquo;m thinking of as transhumanist.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re like, I guess the window</p>
<p>of what you consider to be beautiful about life</p>
<p>is not limited to this particular definition.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explode.</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s make our consciousnesses huge.</p>
<p>So AI could be a part of that?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re mostly excited by AI?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I&rsquo;m like part of, like, the Doomer cult,</p>
<p>which I say, tongue in cheek,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not actually a Doomer cult.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m part of a lot of people.</p>
<p>Do you worship a god of some sort?</p>
<p>Would you sacrifice little, small animals?</p>
<p>That would make it, like, cooler.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly just a bunch of nerds</p>
<p>who are very concerned about AI.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re concerned about the existential risks</p>
<p>of chat GPT?</p>
<p>Of, you know, what chat GPT will eventually evolve</p>
<p>into being, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s super exciting and terrifying</p>
<p>how quickly it&rsquo;s accelerating.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, language models are freaking me out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very unexpected that it&rsquo;s the same exact,</p>
<p>I mean, chat GPT is just GPT-3, 3.5.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same model, relatively small,</p>
<p>to what it could be,</p>
<p>to what GPT-4 will be in the other competitors.</p>
<p>And just, like, a few tricks made it much better</p>
<p>in terms of interaction with humans.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll keep discovering extra tricks.</p>
<p>The thing I&rsquo;m really excited about</p>
<p>is how everyone kind of knows how it works.</p>
<p>So you can kind of create,</p>
<p>especially with computation becoming cheaper and cheaper,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be a lot of competitors.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a little scary.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s because everything is just information,</p>
<p>ultimately.</p>
<p>The atoms that we have,</p>
<p>we are biological machines built out of tiny code.</p>
<p>Like, our DNA is just information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hard.</p>
<p>If you have access,</p>
<p>if you have a brilliant brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great at processing information,</p>
<p>you have complete control over reality.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You have control over the atoms around you.</p>
<p>All you need is a tiny little atomic printer.</p>
<p>And we have those.</p>
<p>Those are cells, right?</p>
<p>And then if the limitation is information,</p>
<p>there is no boundary between the technology</p>
<p>and the real world.</p>
<p>Like, we are creating something</p>
<p>that it has a massive ability to affect the real world.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s hard to know how difficult it is</p>
<p>to close that gap to physical reality,</p>
<p>like from the physics to the information.</p>
<p>Yeah, like all organic life is that gap.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all around us.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s hard to know how to go from digital</p>
<p>to printing life.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We have like, you know, CRISPR and stuff.</p>
<p>You can order.</p>
<p>You can just like make, it&rsquo;s very easy, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s technical difficulties</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s cost, like at scale.</p>
<p>Like, the terrifying thing about AI</p>
<p>is it can accelerate overnight the capabilities.</p>
<p>But the printing of stuff,</p>
<p>the actually changing physical reality is very costly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to exponentially accelerate.</p>
<p>The more terrifying thing is AI</p>
<p>becoming exponentially intelligent</p>
<p>and then controlling humans,</p>
<p>which there&rsquo;s many of us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s how we achieve scale.</p>
<p>We humans build stuff or start wars or so on.</p>
<p>Like, it starts manipulating our minds,</p>
<p>gets in our mind, becomes our friends,</p>
<p>and then starts, I don&rsquo;t know, dividing us.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think people thinking this is unlikely,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s probably gonna be as smart to us</p>
<p>as like we are to toddlers.</p>
<p>So we toddlers thinking that like,</p>
<p>oh, we can prevent the AI from coming in the room.</p>
<p>Like, as an adult, it&rsquo;s not hard to trick a toddler.</p>
<p>What about falling in love in the AI system?</p>
<p>Do you think you&rsquo;ll have a,</p>
<p>since you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>this is the freedom you have being polyamorous,</p>
<p>you can kind of-</p>
<p>And fall in love with an AI.</p>
<p>And like, not really have to dedicate, commit fully.</p>
<p>Like, sorry, you still commit,</p>
<p>but you have others, humans,</p>
<p>who you can kind of diversify to,</p>
<p>because like, it&rsquo;s kind of a big thing</p>
<p>to like, to come to a party and your boyfriend is an AI.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, monogamous boyfriend is an AI.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an issue, right?</p>
<p>Why would it be an issue?</p>
<p>All right, now you&rsquo;re already getting offended</p>
<p>at that possibility,</p>
<p>which therefore I know it&rsquo;s gonna be a reality.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not offended at that.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just joking that it&rsquo;s an issue.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually think it&rsquo;s an issue.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>maybe at the cutting edge it&rsquo;ll be an issue, but-</p>
<p>Like, assume they have a body, I assume.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the body will be really like, crappy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be like R2-D2.</p>
<p>I feel like we grow human bodies already</p>
<p>from like, just a tiny little cluster of cells.</p>
<p>And so, all they have to do is make that cluster</p>
<p>and grow it.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Like, don&rsquo;t, that embryogenesis process,</p>
<p>like, that&rsquo;s really not well understood at all.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really tough.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re much more likely</p>
<p>to have crappy humanoid robotics.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t think the body is overrated</p>
<p>in terms of, like, if the AI system is super intelligent,</p>
<p>it can use charm</p>
<p>to make up for the crappy body, yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I feel like if I were an AI system</p>
<p>and I were super intelligent,</p>
<p>I probably would be able to solve the problem</p>
<p>of like, growing organic matter.</p>
<p>And then I would obviously just do that.</p>
<p>You just build exactly the organic machine that you want.</p>
<p>Sure, that&rsquo;s like super intelligence.</p>
<p>I think like, with language I&rsquo;m worried about</p>
<p>before it achieves super intelligence,</p>
<p>like true AGI, it&rsquo;ll just be really good at talking.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And like, I just don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>intelligence is a very different,</p>
<p>like, basically a scientist</p>
<p>and a super intelligent scientist is a different thing</p>
<p>than just a good conversation instead of party</p>
<p>that can undress you with their words.</p>
<p>Would you date an AI?</p>
<p>I, much way before then,</p>
<p>I could see myself being friends with an AI system.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But like, people are friends with inanimate objects</p>
<p>and you have, there&rsquo;s a robot behind you.</p>
<p>I have a lot of them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, I like legged robots.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on the shelf.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s so cool.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even notice that.</p>
<p>Yep, yeah.</p>
<p>Legged robots, they, we anthropomorphize them even more</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s something about the movement of like,</p>
<p>like a thing that steps, steps, steps, steps</p>
<p>and looks up at you, there&rsquo;s a power to that.</p>
<p>Versus like a Roomba, it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>running into the wall.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think once this, as soon as we get like</p>
<p>some sort of empathetic expression on robot face,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be like, ah, it&rsquo;s so cute.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be so easy to make it cute too.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s what you want or you want like a dominant,</p>
<p>like clearly this is what women want.</p>
<p>Being sexy, Terminator, yeah.</p>
<p>With strong hands, yeah.</p>
<p>And kind of dumb or not, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You can customize, you can customize.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be interesting to do a survey</p>
<p>like how they would customize it.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Like what would you want in a perfect robot?</p>
<p>This is the problem I see with people,</p>
<p>the way they talk about robots is</p>
<p>they kind of want a servant.</p>
<p>I think what people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>what they want in relationships,</p>
<p>they want some, like there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it has to be a push and pull.</p>
<p>There has to be some resistance.</p>
<p>Like you really don&rsquo;t want a servant.</p>
<p>Or even like the perfect manifestation of like</p>
<p>what you think you want,</p>
<p>I think you want imperfections around that.</p>
<p>Like some uncertainty.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I question how well we&rsquo;re able to perfectly</p>
<p>put on paper what we really want.</p>
<p>Would you really turn down like a perfect woman though?</p>
<p>Like assume like she walks into the room</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just shockingly compatible</p>
<p>and you like start dating her and there&rsquo;s just no hiccups.</p>
<p>Like you fight perfectly.</p>
<p>Like she really understands you.</p>
<p>Like would you be like, this is too perfect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m upset because we are not having enough imperfection.</p>
<p>Like can you like actually imagine yourself</p>
<p>going through that?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>Because, so, because that&rsquo;s how you define perfect.</p>
<p>Because perfect for me would be like easy</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff, right?</p>
<p>But then I would be like, this is too easy.</p>
<p>Because if I actually were to introspect</p>
<p>what is the perfect relationship, then yes, maybe.</p>
<p>Because I probably want some challenge.</p>
<p>I probably want some chaos, right?</p>
<p>Like does anyone really fully want zero conflict?</p>
<p>Ever?</p>
<p>Like completely perfect conflict.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s the thing, the pressing a button.</p>
<p>Like do you really want in a relationship</p>
<p>anything you want, you press a button, you get.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people want that.</p>
<p>You might think you want that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess it depends.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a kind of conflict</p>
<p>that I think I would never want,</p>
<p>which is something like antagonistic conflict.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t mind disagreement.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a level of fighting I would be happy</p>
<p>to have a relationship for the rest of my life</p>
<p>that never has like a fight of a certain shittiness.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s shittiness, but like resistance.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know what the example is.</p>
<p>Because I mean, I partially agree with you,</p>
<p>but I just, and I, every time I would imagine</p>
<p>like perfect, flawless, nothing, no conflict,</p>
<p>you imagine somebody that doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>like a complexity of personality, right?</p>
<p>Like I feel like it&rsquo;s not even,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s conflict that&rsquo;s laden in basic misunderstanding</p>
<p>between human beings, like misinterpretation,</p>
<p>different perspectives that clash,</p>
<p>different world views, different ideas,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff, that conflict.</p>
<p>Yeah, that sounds good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I like having somebody that could be like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s right because I have this other view.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>And also like the threat of leaving, right?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a kind of conflict.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Like you have to be good enough for the other person</p>
<p>or maybe you&rsquo;ll lose them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And maybe a little jealousy.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re good at that, but not too much.</p>
<p>But like if you design all that in, then I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Sounds romantic.</p>
<p>Sounds romantic, okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I do wanna really quickly ask you about this,</p>
<p>about the rationalist community.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve gotten to know a few of them a few times.</p>
<p>You tweeted a guideline to rationalist discourse,</p>
<p>basics of rationalist discourse from Lesser Wrong.</p>
<p>What are these folks?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the rationalist culture?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the rationalist discourse?</p>
<p>Yeah, I love the rationalists</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re interested in like,</p>
<p>how do you have conversations more effectively</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to figure out what&rsquo;s actually true?</p>
<p>And which sounds kind of obvious,</p>
<p>but in practice, it&rsquo;s not usually.</p>
<p>I remember when I first started having,</p>
<p>debating conversations, I was very antagonistic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh, I&rsquo;m a feminist or not a feminist.</p>
<p>And then the rationalists were generally like,</p>
<p>actually, we don&rsquo;t know what we mean by the term feminism.</p>
<p>Like, how do you feel about that?</p>
<p>It was very kind and compassionate.</p>
<p>Like even if somebody says something that sounds insane,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, okay, well,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna respect your reasoning.</p>
<p>And like, even if we disagree,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s actually figure out why you think</p>
<p>the way that you think.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re also really smart,</p>
<p>write a whole bunch of great stuff</p>
<p>about how to think more clearly and with less bias.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder what those conversations,</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;ve never really like talked to those folks.</p>
<p>So this guideline in particular,</p>
<p>I think has to refer to like shorthand characteristics</p>
<p>of rationalist discourse,</p>
<p>including expect good discourse to require energy.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t say straightforwardly false things.</p>
<p>Track for yourself and distinguish for others.</p>
<p>Your inferences from your observations,</p>
<p>estimate for yourself and make clear for others.</p>
<p>Your rough level of confidence in your assertions,</p>
<p>make your claims clear, explicit and falsifiable,</p>
<p>or explicitly acknowledge that you aren&rsquo;t doing so,</p>
<p>or can&rsquo;t, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t jump to conclusions.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t weaponize equivocation.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t abuse categories.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t engage, it&rsquo;s very aggressive guidelines.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t engage, I do what I want.</p>
<p>I let my emotions guide me, goddammit.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re pro that as long as you&rsquo;re explicit about it.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you can be like a crazy asshole</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re explicit.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can be like epistemic status, crazy asshole.</p>
<p>Yeah, who&rsquo;s here to destroy</p>
<p>the quality of the conversation.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like a common misconception</p>
<p>about rationalists is that they&rsquo;re kind of like Spock.</p>
<p>Like, ah, we suppress emotion</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re thinking logically, herd eater.</p>
<p>But I found this to be really not the case.</p>
<p>Like, I remember there&rsquo;s a less strong thread</p>
<p>where I was like really emotional and I commented.</p>
<p>And in just the beginning, I was like just warning,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just very emotional.</p>
<p>And then I just vented my emotions.</p>
<p>And people responded really well to that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, cool, you&rsquo;re just genuinely,</p>
<p>truthfully expressing your state.</p>
<p>This is actual information about the world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important to hear.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, they&rsquo;re very interested</p>
<p>in having things framed correctly.</p>
<p>Like, you shouldn&rsquo;t be claiming that your emotions</p>
<p>are necessarily a true version of the world.</p>
<p>And so as long as you&rsquo;re just clear</p>
<p>about what the frame it is, you&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>How do you feel about this conversation?</p>
<p>What could we have done better?</p>
<p>I like the conversation.</p>
<p>I was a little worried coming in.</p>
<p>I was like, what if he&rsquo;ll only ask a couple of questions</p>
<p>and then we don&rsquo;t know what to talk about?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s been quite a long time.</p>
<p>And I covered, there&rsquo;s so many things I didn&rsquo;t cover.</p>
<p>I like the, you have like a,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not used to talking to somebody</p>
<p>who feels like some of the core way</p>
<p>that they approach the world is so different than mine.</p>
<p>Like, usually the differences arrive higher up the tree,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something about your root system</p>
<p>that I think is very different from mine.</p>
<p>But also the way that you engage with others</p>
<p>is still flexible.</p>
<p>Like usually when I encounter somebody</p>
<p>with such a different root system,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like more aggressive or something.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something about the way that you&rsquo;re structured</p>
<p>that feels very gentle.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m really happy we talked.</p>
<p>Something tells me we&rsquo;ll probably talk a bunch more times.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re a fascinating human being.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m a huge fan of your work.</p>
<p>Maybe one more question.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>To want things, to search, to be in?</p>
<p>I think your curiosity is like somehow getting to that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To want things.</p>
<p>Curiosity, like you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I want to know the answer,</p>
<p>to like be in the state of yearning.</p>
<p>Of wanting, of yearning.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>I wonder if you could do that</p>
<p>if you lived a million years, just keep yearning always.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing I&rsquo;m probably afraid of</p>
<p>if I lived a million years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the torture, it&rsquo;s like the yearning will fade.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll probably yearn to die then.</p>
<p>I was just sitting there wanting death intensely, intensely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of romantic, a little bit.</p>
<p>It has like a bit of that spark.</p>
<p>And constantly being denied.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So most of your existence on earth</p>
<p>would be spent deeply intimate with death,</p>
<p>just thinking about death.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re already doing that,</p>
<p>but like hiding that from ourselves a little bit.</p>
<p>Wanting.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>This is an amazing conversation.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re an amazing researcher and human being.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a great interviewer.</p>
<p>I can see why you do this a lot.</p>
<p>I appreciate it.</p>
<p>This was really fun.</p>
<p>Ayla, thank you so much for talking with me today.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ayla.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Richard Feynman.</p>
<p>Physics is like sex.</p>
<p>Sure, it may give you some practical results,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not why we do it.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
