    <p>The following is a conversation with Jed Buchwald, a professor of history and a philosopher of</p>
<p>science at Caltech, interested especially in the development of scientific concepts</p>
<p>and the instruments used to create and explore new effects and ideas in science.</p>
<p>To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and here is my conversation with Jed Buchwald.</p>
<p>Does science progress via paradigm shifts and revolutions as philosopher Thomas Kuhn said,</p>
<p>or does it progress gradually? What do you think?</p>
<p>Well, I got into this field because I was Tom Kuhn&rsquo;s research assistant 50 years ago, 52 years</p>
<p>ago. He pulled me into it out of physics instead. So I know his work pretty well. And in the years</p>
<p>when I was at MIT running an institute, he was then in the philosophy department, used to come</p>
<p>over all the time to the talks we held and so on. So what would I say about that? He, of course,</p>
<p>developed his ideas a lot over the years. The thing that he&rsquo;s famous for, the structure of</p>
<p>scientific revolutions came out in 62. And as you just said, it offered an outline for what he</p>
<p>called a paradigmatic structure, namely the notion that you have to look at what scientists do as</p>
<p>forming a community of investigators, and that they&rsquo;re trying to solve various puzzles, as he</p>
<p>would put it, that crop up, figuring out how this works, how that works and so on. And of course,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t do it out of the blue. They do it within a certain framework. The framework can</p>
<p>be pretty vague. He called it a paradigm. And his notion was that eventually they run into troubles</p>
<p>or what he called anomalies. That kind of cracks things. Somebody new comes along with a different</p>
<p>way of doing it, etc. Do I think things work that way? No, not really. Tom and I used to have</p>
<p>lengthy discussions about that over the years. I do think there is a common structure that</p>
<p>formulates both theoretical and experimental practices. And historians nowadays of science</p>
<p>like to refer to scientific work as what scientists practice. It&rsquo;s almost craftsman like.</p>
<p>They can usually adapt in various ways. And I can give you all kinds of examples of that.</p>
<p>I once wrote a book on the origins of wave theory of light. And that is one of the paradigmatic</p>
<p>examples that Tom used. Only it didn&rsquo;t work that way exactly because he thought that what happened</p>
<p>was that the wave theory ran into trouble with a certain phenomenon, which it couldn&rsquo;t crack.</p>
<p>Well, it turned out that in fact, historically that phenomenon was actually not relevant</p>
<p>later on to the wave theory. And when the wave theory came in, the alternative to it,</p>
<p>which had prevailed, which was Newton&rsquo;s views light as particles that it seemed couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>explain what the wave theory could explain. Again, not true. Not true. Much more complex</p>
<p>than that. The wave theory offered the opportunity to deploy novel experimental and mathematical</p>
<p>structures, which gave younger scientists, mathematicians and others, the opportunity</p>
<p>to effect, manufacture, make new sorts of devices. It&rsquo;s not that the alternative couldn&rsquo;t sort of</p>
<p>explain these things, but it never was able to generate them de novo as novelties. In other</p>
<p>words, if you think of it as something scientists want to progress in the sense of finding new stuff</p>
<p>to solve, then I think what often happens is that it&rsquo;s not so much that the prevailing view</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t crack something as that it doesn&rsquo;t give you the opportunity to do new stuff.</p>
<p>When you say new stuff, are we referring to experimental science here or</p>
<p>new stuff in the space of new theories?</p>
<p>Could be both. Could be both actually.</p>
<p>So how does that&hellip; Can you maybe elaborate a little bit on the story of the wave view?</p>
<p>Sure. The prevailing view of light, at least in France where the wave theory really first took</p>
<p>off, although it had been introduced in England by Thomas Young, the prevailing theory dates back</p>
<p>to Newton that light is a stream of particles and that refraction and reflection involve sort</p>
<p>of repulsive and attractive forces that deflect and bend the paths of these particles. Newton was</p>
<p>not able successfully to deal with the phenomenon of what happens when light goes past a knife&rsquo;s</p>
<p>edge or a sharp edge, what we now call diffraction. He had cooked up something about it that no</p>
<p>mathematical structure could be applied. Thomas Young first, but really this guy named Augustin</p>
<p>Fresnel in France deployed, in Fresnel&rsquo;s case, rather advanced calculus forms of mathematics,</p>
<p>which enabled computations to be done and observations to be melded with these</p>
<p>computations in a way that you could not do or see how to do with Newton. Did that mean that the</p>
<p>Newtonian explanation of what goes on in diffraction fails? Not really. You can actually</p>
<p>make it work, but you can&rsquo;t generate anything new out of it. Whereas using the mathematics</p>
<p>of wave optics in respect to a particular phenomenon called polarization, which ironically</p>
<p>was discovered by partisans of Newton&rsquo;s way of doing things, you were able to generate devices</p>
<p>which reflect light in crystals, do various things that the Newtonian way could accommodate only</p>
<p>after the fact. They couldn&rsquo;t generate it from the beginning. And so if you want to be somebody who</p>
<p>is working a novel vein, which increasingly becomes the case with people who become what we</p>
<p>now call physicists in the 1820s, 30s, and 40s in particular, then that&rsquo;s the direction you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to go. But there were holdouts until the 1850s. I want to try to elaborate on the nature of the</p>
<p>disagreement you have with Thomas Kuhn. So do you still believe in paradigm shifts? Do you still see</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s ideas that really have a transformational effect on science? The nature of</p>
<p>the disagreement has to do with how those paradigm shifts come to be? How they come to be and how</p>
<p>they change. I certainly think they exist. How strong they may be at any given time is maybe not</p>
<p>quite as powerful as Tom thought in general. Although towards the end of his life, he was</p>
<p>beginning to develop different modifications of his original way of thinking. But I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that the changes happened quite so neatly, if you will, in reaction to novel experimental</p>
<p>observations. They get much more complex than that. In terms of neatness, how much of science</p>
<p>progresses by individual lone geniuses and how much by the messy collaboration of competing and</p>
<p>cooperating humans? I don&rsquo;t think you can cut that with a knife to say it&rsquo;s this percent and</p>
<p>that percent. It&rsquo;s almost always the case that there are one or two or maybe three individuals</p>
<p>who are sort of central to what goes on when things begin to shift. Are they inevitably and</p>
<p>solely responsible for what then begins to happen in a major way? I think not. It depends. You can</p>
<p>go very far back with this, even into antiquity to see what goes on. The major locus we always</p>
<p>talk about from the beginning is if you&rsquo;re talking about Galileo&rsquo;s work on motion, for example,</p>
<p>were there ways of accommodating it that others could adapt to without buying into the whole</p>
<p>scheme? Yes. Did it eventually evolve and start convincing people because you could also do</p>
<p>other things with it that you couldn&rsquo;t otherwise do? Also, yes. Let me give you an example.</p>
<p>The great French mathematician philosopher Descartes, who was a mechanical philosopher,</p>
<p>he believed the world was matter in motion. He never thought much of what Galileo had done</p>
<p>in respect to motion because he thought, well, at best, it&rsquo;s some sort of approximative scheme</p>
<p>or something like that. But one of his initial, I wouldn&rsquo;t call him a disciple, but follower,</p>
<p>who then broke with him in a number of ways, was a man named Christian Huygens, who was,</p>
<p>along with Newton, one of the two greatest scientists of the 17th century. Huygens is</p>
<p>older than Newton, and Huygens nicely deployed Galilean relationships in respect to motion</p>
<p>to develop all sorts of things, including the first pendulum governed clock,</p>
<p>and even figured out how to build one, which keeps perfect time, except it didn&rsquo;t work. But</p>
<p>he had the mathematical structure for it. How well known is Huygens?</p>
<p>Oh, very well known. Should I know him well?</p>
<p>Yes, you should. Interesting.</p>
<p>You should definitely know him.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no. Can we define should here?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So is this should like, yeah, can you define should?</p>
<p>Should means this. If you had taken up to a second year physics courses, you should,</p>
<p>you would have heard his name because one of the fundamental principles in optics is called</p>
<p>Huygens principle.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I have and I have heard his name.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>No, but I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>So I mean, there&rsquo;s a very different thing between names attached to principles and laws and so on</p>
<p>that you sometimes let go of, you just remember the equations of the principles themselves,</p>
<p>and the personalities of science. And there&rsquo;s certain personalities,</p>
<p>certain human beings that stand out. And that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s a sense to which the lone inventor,</p>
<p>the lone scientist is the way I personally mean, I think a lot of people think about the history</p>
<p>of science is these lone geniuses. Without them, the senses, if you remove Newton from the picture,</p>
<p>if you remove Galileo from the picture, then science would, there&rsquo;s almost a feeling like</p>
<p>it would just have stopped there. Or at the very least, there&rsquo;s a feeling like it would take much</p>
<p>longer to develop the things that were developed. Is that a silly way to look at the history?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not entirely incorrect, I suppose. I find it difficult to believe that had Galileo not</p>
<p>existed, that eventually someone like Huygens, for instance, given the context of the time,</p>
<p>what was floating around in the belief structure concerning the nature of the world and so on,</p>
<p>the developments in mathematics and whatnot, that sooner or later, whether it would have been</p>
<p>exactly the same or not, I cannot say. But would things have evolved? Yes.</p>
<p>If we look at the long arc of history of science, from back when we were in the caves trying to knock</p>
<p>two rocks together, or maybe make a basic tool to a long time from now, many centuries from now,</p>
<p>when human civilization finally destroys itself. If we look at that history, and imagine you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a historian at the end, like with the fire of the apocalypse coming upon us, and you look back at</p>
<p>this time in the 21st century, how far along are we on that arc? Do you sense? Have we invented</p>
<p>and discovered everything that&rsquo;s to be discovered, or are we at like below 1%? You&rsquo;re going to get a</p>
<p>lot of absurd questions today. I apologize. It&rsquo;s a lugubrious picture you&rsquo;re painting there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what the word lugubrious means, but I love it. Lugubrious.</p>
<p>Well, let me try and separate the question of whether we&rsquo;re all going to die in an apocalypse</p>
<p>in several hundred years or not from the question of where science may be sitting.</p>
<p>Take that as an assumption. Okay. I find that hard to say. And I find it hard to say</p>
<p>because in the deepest sense of the term, as it&rsquo;s usually deployed by philosophers of science today,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not fundamentally a realist. That is to say, I think our access to the inner workings of nature</p>
<p>is inevitably mediated by what we can do with the materials and factors around us. We can probe</p>
<p>things in various ways. Does that mean that I don&rsquo;t think that the standard model in quantum</p>
<p>electrodynamics is incorrect? Of course not. I wouldn&rsquo;t even dream of saying such a thing.</p>
<p>It can do a lot, especially when it comes to figuring out what&rsquo;s happening in very large,</p>
<p>expensive particle accelerators and applying results in cosmology and so on as well.</p>
<p>Do I think that we have inevitably probed the depths of reality through this? I do not agree</p>
<p>with Steven Weinberg who thinks we have about such things. Do I, on the other hand, think that</p>
<p>the way in which science has been moving for the last hundred years, physics in particular is what</p>
<p>I have in mind, will continue on the same course? In that sense, I don&rsquo;t because we&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>be building bigger and bigger and more and more expensive machines to rip apart particles in</p>
<p>various ways. In which case, what are physicists going to do? They&rsquo;ll turn their attention to other</p>
<p>aspects. There are all sorts of things we&rsquo;ve never explained about the material world.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have theories that go beyond a certain point for all sorts of things.</p>
<p>Can we, for example, start with the standard model and work our way up all the way to chemical</p>
<p>transformations? You can make an argument about it and you can justify things, but in chemistry,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the way people work. They work with much higher level quantum mechanical relationships</p>
<p>and so on. This notion of the deep theory to explain everything is a longstanding belief</p>
<p>which goes back pretty far, although I think it only takes its fullest form</p>
<p>sometime towards the end of the 19th century. Maybe we just speak to that. You&rsquo;re referring to</p>
<p>a hope, a dream, a reality of coming up with a theory of everything that explains everything.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very specific thing that that currently means in physics,</p>
<p>is the unification of the laws of physics. But I&rsquo;m sure in antiquity or before it meant maybe</p>
<p>something else, or is it always about physics? Because I mean, I think as you&rsquo;ve kind of implied</p>
<p>in physics, there&rsquo;s a sense once you get to the theory of everything, you&rsquo;ve understood everything,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a very deep sense in which you&rsquo;ve actually understood not very much at all.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve understood at that particular level how things work, but you don&rsquo;t understand how the</p>
<p>abstractions on top of abstractions form, all the way to the chemistry, to the human mind,</p>
<p>and the human societies, and all those kinds of things. So maybe you can speak to the theory of</p>
<p>everything and its history and comment on what the heck does that even mean, the theory of everything.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think you can go back that far with something like that. Maybe to the, at best,</p>
<p>to the 17th century. If you go back all the way in antiquity, there are, of course,</p>
<p>discussions about the nature of the world. But first of all, you have to recognize that the</p>
<p>manipulative character of physics and chemistry, the probing of&hellip; Let me put it this way. We assume</p>
<p>and have assumed for a long time, I&rsquo;ll come back to when in a moment, that if I take a little device,</p>
<p>which is really complicatedly made out of all kinds of things, and I put a piece of some material in</p>
<p>it, and I monkey around with it and do all kinds of unnatural things to it, things that wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>happen naturally, and I find out how it behaves and whatnot, and then I try and make an argument</p>
<p>about how that really applies even in the natural world without any artificial structures and so on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a belief that was widely held by pretty much anyone until sometime maybe</p>
<p>in the 1500s. And when it was first held, it was held by people we now call alchemists.</p>
<p>So alchemy was the first, the early days of the theory of everything, of a dream of a theory of</p>
<p>everything. I would put it a little differently. I think it&rsquo;s more along the way, a dream that</p>
<p>by probing nature in artificially constructed ways, we can find out what&rsquo;s going on deep down there.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s distinct from science being an observing thing, where you observe nature</p>
<p>and you study nature. You&rsquo;re talking about probing, like messing with nature to understand it.</p>
<p>Indeed I am. But that, of course, is the very essence of experimental science. You have to</p>
<p>manipulate nature to find out things about it, and then you have to convince others that you haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>so manipulated it that what you&rsquo;ve done is to produce what amounts to fake artifactual behavior</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t really hold purely naturally. So where are we today in your sense to jump</p>
<p>around a little bit with the theory of everything? Maybe a quick kind of sense you have about the</p>
<p>journey in the world of physics that we&rsquo;re taking towards the theory of everything.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m, of course, not a practicing physicist. I mean, I was trained in physics at Princeton</p>
<p>a long time ago. Until Thomas Kuhn stole you away.</p>
<p>More or less. I was taking graduate courses in those days in general relativity. I was an</p>
<p>undergraduate, but I moved up and then I took a course with him and&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, you made the mistake of being compelled by charismatic philosophers and never looked back.</p>
<p>I suppose so in a way. From what I understand, talking especially to my friends at Caltech,</p>
<p>like Kip Thorne and others, the fundamental notion is that actually the laws that even</p>
<p>at the deepest level we can sort of divine and work with in the universe that we inhabit are</p>
<p>perhaps quite unique to this particular universe as it formed at the Big Bang.</p>
<p>The question is, how deep does it go? If you are very mathematically inclined, the prevailing notion</p>
<p>for several decades now has been what&rsquo;s called string theory, but that has not been able to</p>
<p>figure a way to generate probative experimental evidence, although it&rsquo;s pretty good apparently</p>
<p>at accommodating things. Then the question is, what&rsquo;s before the Big Bang? Actually,</p>
<p>the word before doesn&rsquo;t mean anything given the nature of time, but why do we have the</p>
<p>laws that prevail in our universe? Well, there is a notion that those laws prevail in our universe</p>
<p>because if they didn&rsquo;t, we wouldn&rsquo;t be here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a bit of a cyclical, but nevertheless, a compelling definition. And there&rsquo;s all kinds</p>
<p>of things like it seems like the unification of those laws could be discovered by looking</p>
<p>inside of a black hole because you get both the general relativity and the quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>quantum field theory in there. Experimentally, of course, there&rsquo;s a lot of interesting ideas.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t really look close to the Big Bang. We can&rsquo;t look that far back. Caltech and MIT will</p>
<p>LIGO looking at gravitational waves, perhaps allows us to march backwards and so on. Yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really exciting space. And there&rsquo;s, of course, the theory of everything,</p>
<p>like with a lot of things in science, captivates the dreams of those who are perhaps completely</p>
<p>outside of science. It&rsquo;s the dream of discovering the key to the nature of how everything works.</p>
<p>And that feels deeply human. That&rsquo;s perhaps the basic elements of what makes up a scientist in</p>
<p>the end is that curiosity, that longing to understand. Let me ask, you mentioned a disagreement</p>
<p>with Weinberg on reality. Could you elaborate a little bit? Well, obviously, I don&rsquo;t disagree</p>
<p>with Steve Weinberg on physics itself. I wouldn&rsquo;t know enough to even begin to do that. And clearly,</p>
<p>you know, he&rsquo;s one of the founders of the standard model and so on. And it works to a level of</p>
<p>accuracy that no physical theory has ever worked at before. I suppose the question in my mind is</p>
<p>something that in one way could go back to the philosopher Immanuel Kant in the 18th century,</p>
<p>namely, can we really ever convince ourselves that we have come to grips with something that is</p>
<p>not in itself knowable to us by our senses, or even except in the most remote way through the</p>
<p>complex instruments that we make as to what it is that underlies everything? Can we corral it</p>
<p>with mathematics and experimental structures? Yes. Do I think that a particular way of corraling</p>
<p>nature will inevitably play itself out? I don&rsquo;t know. It always has. I&rsquo;ll put it to you that way.</p>
<p>So the basic question is, can we know reality? Is that the Kant question? Is that the Weinberg</p>
<p>question? We humans, with our brains, can we comprehend reality? Sounds like a very trippy</p>
<p>question because a lot of it rests on definitions of know and comprehend and reality. But</p>
<p>get to the bottom of it. It&rsquo;s turtles on top of turtles. Can we get to the bottom turtle and say</p>
<p>hello? Well, maybe I can put it to you this way in a way that I often begin discussions in a class</p>
<p>on the history of science and so on, and say, I&rsquo;m looking at you. Yes. You are in fact a figment of</p>
<p>my imagination. You have a messed up imagination, yes. Well, what do I mean by that? If I were a</p>
<p>dragonfly looking at you, whatever my nervous system would form by way of a perceptual structure</p>
<p>would clearly be utterly different from what my brain and perceptual system altogether is forming</p>
<p>when I look at you. Who&rsquo;s right? Is it me or the dragonfly?</p>
<p>Well, the dragonfly is certainly very impressive, so I don&rsquo;t know. But yes, the observer matters.</p>
<p>What is that supposed to tell us about objective reality?</p>
<p>Well, I think it means that it&rsquo;s very difficult to get beyond the constructs that our perceptual</p>
<p>system is leading us to. When we make apparatus and devices and so on, we&rsquo;re still making things,</p>
<p>the results of which or the outputs of which we process perceptually in various ways.</p>
<p>An analogy I like to use with students sometimes is this. All right, they all have their laptops</p>
<p>open in front of them, of course. I&rsquo;ve sent them something to read, and I say, okay, click on it</p>
<p>and open it up. PDF opens up. I said, what are you looking at? They said, well, I&rsquo;m looking at the</p>
<p>paper that you sent me. I said, no, you&rsquo;re not. What you&rsquo;re looking at is what you&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>is a stream of light coming off LEDs or LCDs coming off a screen. And I said, what happens when you</p>
<p>use your mouse and move that fake piece of paper on the screen around? What are you doing? You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not moving a piece of paper around, are you? You&rsquo;re moving a construct around, a construct</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being processed so that our perceptual system can interact with it in the way we</p>
<p>interact with pieces of paper. Yes. But it&rsquo;s not real. So, are there things outside of the reach</p>
<p>of science? Can you maybe, as an example, talk about consciousness? I&rsquo;m asking for a friend</p>
<p>trying to figure this thing out. Well, boy, I mean, I read a fair bit of science, but I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know. I read a fair bit about that, but I certainly can&rsquo;t really say much about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a materialist in the deepest sense of the term. I don&rsquo;t think there is anything out there</p>
<p>except material structures which interact in various ways. Do I think, for example,</p>
<p>that this bottle of water is conscious? No, I do not. Although, how would I know? I can&rsquo;t talk to</p>
<p>it. Yeah. But, so what do&hellip; It&rsquo;s a hypothesis you have. It&rsquo;s an opinion, an educated opinion</p>
<p>that may be very wrong. Well, I know that you&rsquo;re conscious because I can interact directly with you.</p>
<p>But am I? Well, unless you&rsquo;re a figment of my imagination, of course. Or I&rsquo;m a robot that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>able to generate the illusion of consciousness effectively enough to facilitate a good</p>
<p>conversation. Because we humans do want to pretend that we&rsquo;re talking to other conscious beings.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we respect them. If it&rsquo;s not conscious, we don&rsquo;t respect them. We&rsquo;re not good at talking</p>
<p>to robots. That&rsquo;s true. Of course, we generalize from our own inner sense, which is the kind of</p>
<p>thing Descartes said from the beginning. We generalize from that. But I do think that</p>
<p>consciousness must be something, whatever it is, that occurs as a result of some particular</p>
<p>organizational structure of material elements. Does materialism mean that it&rsquo;s all within the</p>
<p>reach of science? My sense would be that, especially as neuroscience progresses more and more and</p>
<p>at Caltech, we just built a whole neuroscience arena and so on. And as more knowledge is gained</p>
<p>about the ways in which animals, when they behave, what patterns show up at various parts of the</p>
<p>brain and nervous system, and perhaps extending it to humans eventually as well, we&rsquo;ll get more of a</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get more of a handle on what brain activity is associated with experiences that we have as</p>
<p>humans. Can we move from the brain activity to the experiences in terms of our perception? No,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t. Perception is perception. That&rsquo;s the hypothesis, once again.</p>
<p>Maybe consciousness is just one of the laws of physics that&rsquo;s yet to be discovered. Maybe it</p>
<p>permeates all matter. Maybe it&rsquo;s as simple as trying to plug it in and plug into the ability</p>
<p>to generate and control that kind of law of physics that would crack open. Or we would understand</p>
<p>that the bottle of water is in fact conscious, just much less conscious than us humans,</p>
<p>and then we would be able to generate beings that are more conscious.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;ll be unfortunate. I&rsquo;d have to stop drinking the water after that.</p>
<p>Every time you take a sip, there&rsquo;s a little bit of suffering going on.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>What do you use the most interesting, beautiful moments in the history of science? What stands</p>
<p>out? And then we can pull at that thread.</p>
<p>Right. Well, I like to think of events that have a major impact and involve both beautiful,</p>
<p>conceptual, mathematical, if we&rsquo;re talking physical structures work, and are associated as</p>
<p>well with probing experimental situations. So among my favorites is one of the most famous,</p>
<p>which was the young Isaac Newton&rsquo;s work with the colors produced when you pass sunlight through a</p>
<p>prism. And why do I like that? It&rsquo;s not profoundly mathematical in one sense. It doesn&rsquo;t need it</p>
<p>initially. It needs the following though, which begins to show you I think a little bit about what</p>
<p>gets involved when you&rsquo;ve got a smart individual who&rsquo;s trying to monkey around with stuff and</p>
<p>finds new things about it. First, let me say that the prevailing notion going back to antiquity</p>
<p>was that colors are produced in a sense by modifying or tinting white light, that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>modifications of white light. In other words, the colors are not in the sunlight in any way.</p>
<p>Now, what Newton did following experiments done by Descartes before him who came to very different</p>
<p>conclusions, he took a prism. You might ask, where do you get prisms in the 1660s? County fairs,</p>
<p>they were very popular. They were pretty crude with bubbles in them and everything,</p>
<p>but they produced colors. So you could buy them at county fairs and things very popular.</p>
<p>Oh, so they were modifying the white light to create colors.</p>
<p>Well, they were creating colors from it, well known. And what he did was the following. He</p>
<p>was by this time, even though he&rsquo;s very young, a very good mathematician. And he could use the</p>
<p>then known laws for how light behaves when it goes through glass to calculate what should happen</p>
<p>if you took light from the sun, passed it from a hole, through a little hole, then hit the prism,</p>
<p>goes out of the prism, strikes a wall a long distance away and makes a splash of light,</p>
<p>never mind the colors for a moment, makes a splash of light there. He was very smart.</p>
<p>First of all, he abstracts from the colors themselves, even though that&rsquo;s what everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>paying attention to initially. Because what he knows is this, he knows that if you take</p>
<p>this prism and you turn it to a certain particular angle, that he knew what it should be because he</p>
<p>could calculate things. Very few other people in Europe at the time could calculate things like he</p>
<p>could. That if you turn the prism to that particular angle, then the sun, which is, of course, a</p>
<p>circle, when its light passes through this little hole and then into the prism on the far distant</p>
<p>wall, should still make a circle. But it doesn&rsquo;t. It makes a very long image. And this led him to a</p>
<p>very different conception of light, indicating that there are different types of light in the</p>
<p>sunlight. Now, to go beyond that, what&rsquo;s particularly interesting, I think, is the following.</p>
<p>When he published this paper, which got him into a controversy, he really didn&rsquo;t describe</p>
<p>at all what he did. He just gave you some numbers. Now, I just told you that you had to set this</p>
<p>prism at a certain angle, right? You would think, because we do have his notes and so on,</p>
<p>you would think that he took some kind of complicated measuring device to set the prism.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t. He held it in his hand. That&rsquo;s all. And he twiddled it around. And what was he doing?</p>
<p>It turns out that when you twiddle the prism around at the point where you should get a circle</p>
<p>from a circle, it also is the place where the image does not move very fast. So if you want</p>
<p>to get close to there, you just twiddle it. This is manipulative experimentation taking advantage</p>
<p>through his mathematical knowledge of the inherent inaccuracies that let you come to</p>
<p>exact conclusions, regardless of the built in problematics of measurement. He&rsquo;s the only one</p>
<p>I know of doing anything like that at the time. Yeah. Well, even still, there&rsquo;s very few people</p>
<p>that are able to have to calculate as well as he did to be a theoretician and an experimentalist,</p>
<p>like in the same moment. It&rsquo;s true, although until really well into the 20th century,</p>
<p>maybe the beginning of the 20th century, really, most of the most significant experimental results</p>
<p>produced in the 1800s, which laid the foundations for light, electricity, electrodynamics, and so on,</p>
<p>even hydrodynamics and whatnot, were also produced by people who are both excellent calculators,</p>
<p>very talented mathematicians, and good with their hands experimentally.</p>
<p>And then that led to the 21st century with Enrico Fermi that one of the last people that</p>
<p>was able to do that, both of those things very well, and that he built a little device</p>
<p>called an atomic bomb that has some positives and negatives.</p>
<p>Well, right. Of course, that actually did involve some pretty large scale elaborate</p>
<p>equipment too. Well, holding a prism in your hands.</p>
<p>Right. No. What&rsquo;s the controversy that Newton got into with that paper when he published it?</p>
<p>Well, in a number of ways, it&rsquo;s a complicated story. There was a very talented character</p>
<p>known as a mechanic. Mechanic means somebody who was a craftsman who could build and make</p>
<p>really good stuff. And he was very talented. His name was Robert Hooke. And he was the guy who</p>
<p>at the weekly meetings of the Royal Society in London, and Newton&rsquo;s not in London, he&rsquo;s at</p>
<p>Cambridge, he&rsquo;s a young guy, he would demonstrate new things. And he was very clever. And he had</p>
<p>written a book, in fact, called the Micrographia, which by the way, he used a microscope to make</p>
<p>the first depictions of things like a fly&rsquo;s eye, the structure of, you know, it had a big influence.</p>
<p>And in there, he also talked about light. And so he had a different view of light. And when he read</p>
<p>what Newton wrote, he had a double reaction. On the one hand, he said, anything in there that is</p>
<p>correct, I already knew. And anything that I didn&rsquo;t already know, is probably not right anyway.</p>
<p>Trey Lockerbie I gotta love egos. Okay. Can we just step</p>
<p>back? Can you say who was Isaac Newton? What are the things he contributed to this world</p>
<p>in the space of ideas? Wow. Who was he? He was born in 1642,</p>
<p>and near the small town of Grantham in England. In fact, the house he was born in,</p>
<p>and that his mother died in is still there and can be visited.</p>
<p>His father died before he was born. And his mother eventually remarried a man named</p>
<p>Reverend Smith, whom Newton did not like at all. Because Reverend Smith took his mother away to</p>
<p>live with him a few miles away, leaving Newton to be brought up more or less by his grandmother</p>
<p>over there. And he had huge resentment about that his whole life.</p>
<p>I think that gives you a little inkling that a little bit of trauma in childhood,</p>
<p>maybe a complicated father son relationship can be useful to create a good scientist.</p>
<p>Could be, although this case, it would be right, the absent father, non father relationship,</p>
<p>so to speak. He was known as a kid, little that we do know for being very clever about</p>
<p>flying kites. And there are stories about him putting candles and putting flying kites and</p>
<p>scaring the living devil out of people at night by doing that and things like that,</p>
<p>making things. Most of the physicists and natural philosophers I&rsquo;ve dealt with actually,</p>
<p>as children, were very fond of making and playing with things. I can&rsquo;t think of one I know of who</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t actually, very good with their hands and whatnot. His mother wanted him to take over the</p>
<p>manor. It was a kind of farming manor. They were the class of what are known as yeomans.</p>
<p>There are stories that he wasn&rsquo;t very good at that. One day, one of the stories is he&rsquo;s sitting</p>
<p>out in the field and the cows come home without him and he doesn&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on. Anyway,</p>
<p>had relatives and he manages to get to Cambridge, sent to Cambridge because he&rsquo;s known to be smart.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s read books that he got from local dignitaries and some relatives. And he goes there as what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>known as a sub sizer. What does that mean? Well, it&rsquo;s not too pleasant. Basically, a sub sizer</p>
<p>was a student who had to clean the bed pans of the richer kids. That didn&rsquo;t last too long.</p>
<p>He makes his way and he becomes absorbed in some of the new ways of thinking that are being talked</p>
<p>about on the parts of Descartes and others as well. There&rsquo;s also the traditional curriculum,</p>
<p>which he follows. And we have his notes. We have his student notebooks and so on. We can see</p>
<p>gradually this young man&rsquo;s mind focusing and coming to grips with deeper questions of the</p>
<p>nature of the world and perception even, and how we know things and also probing and learning</p>
<p>mathematical structures to such an extent that he builds on some of the investigations that had been</p>
<p>done in the period before him to create the foundations of a way of investigating processes</p>
<p>that happen and change continuously instead of by leaps and bounds and so on, forming the</p>
<p>foundation of what we now call the calculus. Yeah. So can you maybe just paint a little bit</p>
<p>of a picture you&rsquo;ve already started of what were the things that bothered him the most</p>
<p>that stood out to him the most about the traditional curriculum, about the way people</p>
<p>saw the world? You mentioned discrete versus continuous. Is there something where he began</p>
<p>thinking in a revolutionary way? Because it&rsquo;s fascinating. Most of us go to college,</p>
<p>Cambridge or otherwise, and we just kind of take what we hear as gospel, right? Like not gospel,</p>
<p>but as like facts. You don&rsquo;t begin to sort of see how can I expand on this aggressively or how can</p>
<p>I challenge everything that I hear rigorously, mathematically through the&hellip; I mean, I don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>know how rigorous the mathematics was at that point. I&rsquo;m sure it was geometry and so on,</p>
<p>no calculus, huh? There are elements of what turned into the calculus that predate Newton,</p>
<p>but&hellip; How much rigor was there? How much&hellip; Well, rigor, no. And then, of course, no scientific</p>
<p>method. Not really. I mean, somewhat. I mean, appreciation of data. That is a separate question</p>
<p>from a question of method. Appreciation of data is a significant question as to what you do with</p>
<p>data. There&rsquo;s lots of things you&rsquo;re asking. I apologize. So maybe let&rsquo;s backtrack in the first</p>
<p>question. Was there something that was bothering him that he especially thought he could contribute</p>
<p>or work on? Well, of course, we can&rsquo;t go back and talk to him, but we do have these student</p>
<p>notebooks. There&rsquo;s two of them. One&rsquo;s called The Philosophical Questions and the other is called</p>
<p>The Waste Book. The Philosophical Questions has discussions of the nature of reality and</p>
<p>various issues concerning it. And The Waste Book has things that have to do with motion in various</p>
<p>ways, what happens in collisions and things of that sort. And it&rsquo;s a complicated story,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s among the things that I think are interesting is he took notes in The Philosophical</p>
<p>Questions on stuff that was traditionally given to you in the curriculums going back several hundred</p>
<p>years, namely on what scholars refer to as scholastic or neo scholastic ways of thinking</p>
<p>about the world dating back to the reformulation of Aristotle in the Middle Ages by Thomas Aquinas</p>
<p>in the church. This is a totally different way of thinking about things, which actually connects to</p>
<p>something we were saying a moment ago. For instance, so I&rsquo;m wearing a blue shirt and I will</p>
<p>sometimes ask students, where is the blue? And they&rsquo;ll usually say, well, it&rsquo;s in your shirt.</p>
<p>And then some of them get clear and they say, well, no, you know, light is striking it,</p>
<p>photons are reemitted, they strike the back of your retina and et cetera, et cetera. And I said,</p>
<p>yes. What that means is that the blue is actually an artifact of our perceptual system considered as</p>
<p>the percept of blue. It&rsquo;s not out there, it&rsquo;s in here. That&rsquo;s not how things were thought about</p>
<p>well into the 16th century. The general notion dating back even to Aristotelian antiquity</p>
<p>and formalized by the 12th century at Paris, Oxford and elsewhere is that qualities are there</p>
<p>in the world. They&rsquo;re not in us. We have senses and our senses can be wrong. You could go blind,</p>
<p>things like that. But if they&rsquo;re working properly, you get the actual qualities of the world.</p>
<p>Now, that break, which is occurring towards the end of the 16th century and is most visible in</p>
<p>Descartes, is the break between conceiving that the qualities of the world are very different</p>
<p>from the qualities that we perceive. That in fact, the qualities of the world consist almost</p>
<p>entirely in shapes of various kinds and maybe hard particles or whatever, but not colors,</p>
<p>not sounds, not smells, not softness and hardness. They&rsquo;re not in the world, they&rsquo;re in us.</p>
<p>That break Newton is picking up as he reads Descartes. He&rsquo;s going to disagree with a lot in</p>
<p>Descartes, but that break he is, among other things, picking up very strongly. And that</p>
<p>underlies a lot of the way he works later on when he becomes skeptical of the evidence provided</p>
<p>by the senses. Yeah, that&rsquo;s actually, I don&rsquo;t know, the way you&rsquo;re describing is so powerful.</p>
<p>It just makes me realize how liberating that is as a scientist, as somebody who&rsquo;s trying</p>
<p>to understand reality, that our senses are not to be trusted, that reality is to be investigated</p>
<p>through tools that are beyond our senses. Yes, or that improve our senses in some ways.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty powerful. For a human being to realize I can&rsquo;t trust my own senses at that time,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty trippy. It&rsquo;s coming in, it&rsquo;s coming in. And I think it arises probably a fair number</p>
<p>of decades before that, perhaps in part with all chemical experimentation and manipulations,</p>
<p>that you have to go through elaborate structures to produce things and ways you think about it.</p>
<p>But let me give you an example that I think you might find interesting because it&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>it involves that guy named Hooke that Newton had an argument with. And he had lots of arguments</p>
<p>with Hooke, although Hooke was a very clever guy and gave him some things that stimulated him later.</p>
<p>Anyway, Hooke, who was argumentative, and he really was convinced that the only way to gain</p>
<p>real knowledge of nature is through carefully constructed devices. And he was an expert</p>
<p>mechanic, if you will, at building such things. Now, there was a rather wealthy man in Danzig</p>
<p>by the name of Hevelius, Latinized name. He was a brewer in town. And he had become very</p>
<p>fascinated with the telescope. This is 30 years or so, 20 or 30 years after the telescope had</p>
<p>moved out and become more common. And he built a large observatory on the top of his brewery,</p>
<p>actually. And working with his wife, they used these very elaborately constructed</p>
<p>grass and metal instruments to make observations of positions of the stars. And he published a whole</p>
<p>new catalog of where the stars are. And he claimed it was incredibly accurate. He claimed it was so</p>
<p>accurate that nothing had ever come close to it. Hooke reads this, and he says, wait a minute,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t use a telescope here of any kind, because what&rsquo;s the point? Unless you do something</p>
<p>to the telescope, all you see are dots with stars. You just use your eyes. Your eyes can&rsquo;t be that</p>
<p>good. It&rsquo;s impossible. So what did Hooke do to prove this? He said, what you should have done</p>
<p>is you should have put a little device in the telescope that lets you measure distances between</p>
<p>these dots. You didn&rsquo;t do that. And because you didn&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s no way you could have been that</p>
<p>good. At two successive meetings of the Royal Society, he hauls the members out into the courtyard</p>
<p>and he takes a card and he makes successive black and white stripes on the card. And he pastes the</p>
<p>card up on a wall and he takes them one by one. He says, now move back looking at it, presumably</p>
<p>with one eye, until you can&rsquo;t tell the black ones from the white stripes. He says, that I can then</p>
<p>measure the distance. I can see the angles. I can give a number then for what is the best possible,</p>
<p>what we would call perceptual acuity of human vision. And it turned out, he thought, to be</p>
<p>something like 10 or more times worse than this guy Hevelius had claimed. So obviously he says,</p>
<p>Hooke, Hevelius. Well, years ago, I calculated Hevelius&rsquo;s numbers and so on using modern</p>
<p>tables from NASA and so on. And they are even more accurate than Hevelius claimed. And worse than</p>
<p>that, the Royal Society sent a young astronomer named Halley over to Dantzig to work with him.</p>
<p>And Halley writes back and he says, I couldn&rsquo;t believe it, but he taught me how to do it.</p>
<p>And I could get just as good as he. How is it possible? Well, here, this shows you something</p>
<p>very interesting about experiments, perception and everything else. Hooke was right, but he was also</p>
<p>wrong. He was wrong for the right reasons and he was right for the wrong reasons. And what do I</p>
<p>mean by that? What he actually found was the number for what we now call 2020 vision. He was</p>
<p>right. You can&rsquo;t tell, except a few people, much better than that. But he was observing the wrong</p>
<p>thing. What Hevelius was observing was a bright dot, a star, moving past a pointer.</p>
<p>Our eyes are rather similar to frogs eyes. You know, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard the story. If I hold</p>
<p>a dead fly on a string in front of a frog and don&rsquo;t move it, the frog pays no attention. As soon</p>
<p>as I move the fly, the frog immediately tongue lats out because the visual system of the frog</p>
<p>responds to motion. So does ours and our acuity for distinguishing motion from statics, five or</p>
<p>more times better. Yeah, that&rsquo;s fascinating. Damn. And of course, I mean, maybe you can comment on</p>
<p>their understanding of the human perceptual system at the time. It&rsquo;s probably really terrible.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, like I&rsquo;ve recently been working with just almost as a fun side thing with vision</p>
<p>scientists and peripheral vision. It&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a beautiful, complex mess. That whole thing,</p>
<p>we still don&rsquo;t understand all the weird ways that human perception works. And they were probably</p>
<p>terrible at it. They probably didn&rsquo;t even have any conceptual peripheral vision or anything like</p>
<p>any conceptual peripheral vision or, or the fovea or, or, I mean, basically anything.</p>
<p>They had some, I mean, because actually it was Newton himself who probed a lot of this. For</p>
<p>instance, Newton, the young Newton trying to work his way around what&rsquo;s going on with colors,</p>
<p>wanted to try and distinguish colors that occur through natural processes out there and colors</p>
<p>that are a result of our eyes not operating whites. You know what he did? It&rsquo;s a famous thing.</p>
<p>He took a stick and he stuck that stick under his lower eyelid and pushed up on his eyeball.</p>
<p>And what that did, what produced colored circles at diametrically opposite positions of the stick</p>
<p>in the eyeball. And he moved it around to see how they moved, trying to distinguish.</p>
<p>Legit. Right? I always have to tell my students don&rsquo;t do this, but.</p>
<p>Or do it if you want to be great and remembered by human history. That&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>equivalent to sticking a stick into your eye in modern day that may pay off in the end. Okay.</p>
<p>As a small aside, is the Newton and the Apple story true?</p>
<p>No. Was it a different fruit?</p>
<p>As a colleague of mine named Simon Schaffer in England once said on a Nova program that we were</p>
<p>both on, the role of fruit in the history of science has been vastly exaggerated.</p>
<p>Okay. So was there any, I mean, to, to the zoom out moments of epiphany,</p>
<p>is, is there something to moments of epiphany? Oh, again, this is the paradigm shift versus the</p>
<p>gradualism. There is a shift. It&rsquo;s a much more complex one than that. And we,</p>
<p>as it happens, a colleague of mine and I are writing a paper right now on one of the aspects</p>
<p>of these things based on the work that many of our colleagues have done over the last 30 and 40 years.</p>
<p>Let me try and see if I could put it to you this way. Newton, until the early 1670s and probably</p>
<p>really until a fair time after that, first of all, was not very interested in questions of motion.</p>
<p>He was working actually in all chemical relationships or what is called by historians</p>
<p>chymistry, a kind of early modern chemical structure. Colleagues of ours at Indiana have</p>
<p>even reproduced the amalgams that, you know, anyway, his way of thinking about motion involved</p>
<p>a certain set of relationships, which was not conducive to any application of motion.</p>
<p>Not conducive to any application that would yield computationally direct results for things like</p>
<p>planetary motions, which he wasn&rsquo;t terribly interested in anyway. He enters a correspondence</p>
<p>with his original nemesis, Robert Hooke. And Hooke says, well, have you ever thought about,</p>
<p>and then Hooke tells him a certain way you might think about it. And when Newton hears that,</p>
<p>he recognizes that there is a way to inject time that would enable him to solve certain problems.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that there was anything he thought before that was contrary to that way of thinking,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that that particular technical insight was not something that,</p>
<p>for a lot of reasons that are complex, had never occurred to him at all. And that sent him a</p>
<p>different way of thinking. But to answer your question about the Apple business, which is always</p>
<p>about, you know, gravity and the moon and all of that being, no. The reason there is that the idea</p>
<p>that what goes on here in the neighborhood of the earth and what goes on at the moon,</p>
<p>at the moon, let us say, remind the sun and the planets, can be due to a direct relationship</p>
<p>between the earth, let&rsquo;s say, and the moon, is contrary to fundamental beliefs held by many of</p>
<p>the mechanical philosophers, as they&rsquo;re called at the time, in which everything has to involve</p>
<p>at least a sequence of direct contacts, has to be something between here and there that&rsquo;s involved.</p>
<p>And Hooke, probably not thinking terribly deeply about it, based on what he said,</p>
<p>along with others, like the architect and mathematician Christopher Wren,</p>
<p>harken back to the notion that, well, maybe there is a kind of magnetic relationship between the</p>
<p>moon and maybe the planets and the earth and gravity and so on, vague, but establishing a</p>
<p>direct connection somehow, however it&rsquo;s happening, forget about it. Newton wouldn&rsquo;t have cared about</p>
<p>that, if that&rsquo;s all they said, but it was when Hooke mentioned this different way of thinking</p>
<p>about the motion, a way he could certainly have thought of, because it does not contradict</p>
<p>anything. Newton is a brilliant mathematician, and he could see that you could suddenly start</p>
<p>to do things with that, that you otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t, and this led eventually to another</p>
<p>controversy with Hooke, in which Hooke said, well, after Newton published his Great Principia,</p>
<p>I gave him how to do this. And then Newton, of course, got ticked off about that and said, well,</p>
<p>listen to this, I did everything, and because he had a picayune little idea,</p>
<p>he thinks he can take credit for it. Okay. So his ability to play with his ideas mathematically is</p>
<p>what solidified the initial intuition that you could have. Was that the first time he was born,</p>
<p>the idea that you have action at a distance, that you can have forces without contact,</p>
<p>which is another revolutionary idea? I would say that in the sense of dealing with</p>
<p>the mechanics of force like effects considered to act at some distance, it is novel with both</p>
<p>Hooke and Newton at the time. The notion that two things might interact at a distance with one</p>
<p>another without direct contact, that goes back to antiquity. Only there it would be thought of</p>
<p>more as a sympathetic reaction to a magnet and a piece of iron. They have a kind of mutual sympathy</p>
<p>for one another. Like what? Love? What are we talking about? Actually, they do sometimes talk</p>
<p>like that. That is love. See, now I talk like that all the time. I think love is somehow</p>
<p>in consciousness or forces of physics that yet to be discovered. Okay. Now there&rsquo;s the other side</p>
<p>of things, which is calculus that you began to talk about. So Newton brought a lot of things</p>
<p>to this world. One of them is calculus. What is calculus? And what was Newton&rsquo;s role in bringing</p>
<p>it to life? What was it like? What was the story of bringing calculus to this world? Well, since</p>
<p>the publication starting many decades ago by Tom Whiteside, who&rsquo;s now deceased, of Newton&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mathematical papers, we know a lot about how he was pushing things and how he was developing things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complex question to say what calculus is. Calculus is the set of mathematical techniques</p>
<p>that enable you to investigate what we now call functions, mathematical functions,</p>
<p>which are continuous. That is, that are not formed out of discrete sets like the counting numbers,</p>
<p>for instance. Newton, there were already procedures for solving problems involving</p>
<p>such things as finding areas to under curves and tangents to curves by using geometrical structures,</p>
<p>but only for certain limited types of curves, if you will. Newton as a young man, we know this is</p>
<p>what happened, is looking at a formula which involves an expansion in separate terms, polynomial</p>
<p>terms, as we say, for certain functions. I know I don&rsquo;t want to get complicated here about this,</p>
<p>and he realizes it could be generalized. And he tries the generalization and that leads him to</p>
<p>an expansion formula called the binomial theorem. That enables him to move ahead with the notion</p>
<p>that if I take something that has a certain value, and I add a little bit to it, and I use</p>
<p>this binomial theorem and expand things out, I can begin to do new things. And the new things that</p>
<p>he begins to do leads him to a recognition that the calculations of areas and the calculations</p>
<p>of tangents to curves are reciprocal to one another. And the procedures that he develops</p>
<p>is a particular form of the calculus in which he considers small increments and then continuous</p>
<p>flows and changes of curves and so on. And we have relics of it in physics today, the notation</p>
<p>in which you put a dot over a variable indicating the rate of change of the variable. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Newton&rsquo;s original type of notation. The dot. Yeah, the dot notation.</p>
<p>Possibly independently of Newton, because he didn&rsquo;t publish this thing, although he became</p>
<p>quite well known as quite a brilliant young man, in part because people heard about his work and</p>
<p>so on. When another young man by the name of Gottfried Leibniz visited London and he heard</p>
<p>about these things, it is said that he independently develops his form of the calculus,</p>
<p>which is actually the form we use today, both in notation and perhaps in certain</p>
<p>fundamental ways of thinking. It has remained a controversial point as to where exactly and how</p>
<p>much independently Leibniz did it. Leibniz aficionados think and continue to maintain he</p>
<p>did it completely independently. Newton, when he became president of the Royal Society, put together</p>
<p>a group to go on the attack saying, no, he must have taken everything. We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I will tell you this. About 25 or so years ago, a scholar who&rsquo;s a professor at Indiana now</p>
<p>named Domenico Melli got his hands on a Leibniz manuscript called the Tentamen,</p>
<p>which was Leibniz&rsquo;s attempt to produce an alternative to Newton&rsquo;s mechanics.</p>
<p>Mm hmm.</p>
<p>And it comes to some conclusions that you have in Newton&rsquo;s mechanics. Well, he published that,</p>
<p>but Melli got the manuscript. And what Melli found out was that Leibniz reverse engineered</p>
<p>the Principia and cooked it backwards so that he could get the results he wanted.</p>
<p>That was for the mechanics. So that means his mind allows for that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Some people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re breaking some news today. You&rsquo;re starting some whole drama.</p>
<p>Some people think so. I think most historians of mathematics do not agree with that.</p>
<p>A friend of mine, rather well known physicist, unfortunately, died a couple of years ago named</p>
<p>Mike Nowenberg at UC Santa Cruz, had some evidence along those lines. Didn&rsquo;t pass mustard</p>
<p>with many of my friends who are historians of math. In fact, I edit with a historian of math,</p>
<p>a technical journal, and we were unable to publish it in there because we couldn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>it through any of our colleagues. But I am, I remain suspicious.</p>
<p>What is it about those tense relationships and that kind of drama? Einstein doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>appear to have much of that drama. Nobody claimed, I haven&rsquo;t heard claims that they&rsquo;ve,</p>
<p>perhaps because it&rsquo;s such crazy ideas, of any of his major inventions, major ideas,</p>
<p>being those that are basically, I came up with it first or independently. There&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>as far as I&rsquo;m aware, not many people talk about general relativity, especially in those terms.</p>
<p>But with Newton, that was the case. I mean, is that just a natural outgrowth of how science works?</p>
<p>Is there going to be personalities that, I&rsquo;m not saying this about Linus, but maybe I am,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s people who steal ideas for the, because of ego, because of all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s all that common, frankly. The Newton book, Leibniz, Contratemps and so on.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re at the beginnings of a lot of things there and so on. These are difficult</p>
<p>and complex times as well. These are times in which science as an activity pursued by other than,</p>
<p>let us say, interested aristocrats is becoming something somewhat different. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a professional community of investigators in the same way. It&rsquo;s also a period in which</p>
<p>procedures and rules or practice are being developed to avoid attacking one another directly</p>
<p>and pulling out a sword to cut off the other guy&rsquo;s head if he disagrees with you and so on.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very different period. Controversies happen. People get angry. I can think of a number</p>
<p>of others, including in the development of optics in the 19th century and so on, and it can get hot</p>
<p>under the collar. Sometimes one character who&rsquo;s worked an area extensively, whether they&rsquo;ve come</p>
<p>up with something terribly novel or not, and somebody else kind of moves in and does completely</p>
<p>different and novel things, the first guy gets upset about it because he&rsquo;s sort of muscled into</p>
<p>what I thought was my area. You find that sort of stuff. But do you have examples of cases where it</p>
<p>worked out well, like that competition is good for the progress of science? Yeah, it almost always is</p>
<p>good in that sense. It&rsquo;s just painful for the individuals involved. It can be. It doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to be nasty, although sometimes it is. So for the example with optics, could you comment on that one?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, sure. There are several, but I could give you&hellip; All right, so I&rsquo;ll give you this</p>
<p>example that probably is the most pertinent. The first polytechnic school like MIT or Caltech was</p>
<p>actually founded in France during the French Revolution. It exists today. It&rsquo;s the Ecole</p>
<p>Polytechnique. Two people who were there were two young men in the 90s, 1790s named on the one hand</p>
<p>Francois Arago and the other Jean Baptiste Biot. They both lived a long time, well into the 1850s.</p>
<p>Arago became a major administrator of science and Biot&rsquo;s career started to peter out after about the</p>
<p>late teens. Now, they are sent on an expedition, which was one of the expeditions involving</p>
<p>measuring things to start the metric system. There&rsquo;s a lot more to that story. Anyway,</p>
<p>they come back. Arago gets separated. He&rsquo;s captured by pirates actually. Wounds up in</p>
<p>Tangier, escapes, is captured again. Everybody thinks he&rsquo;s dead. He gets back to Paris and so on.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s greeted as a hero and whatnot. In the meantime, Biot has pretty much published some</p>
<p>of the stuff that he&rsquo;s done and Arago doesn&rsquo;t get much credit for it and Arago starts to get very</p>
<p>angry and Biot is known for this kind of thing. Biot starts investigating a new phenomenon in</p>
<p>optics involving something called polarization and he writes all kinds of stuff on it. Arago</p>
<p>looks into this and decides to write some things as well and actually Biot gets mostly interested</p>
<p>in it when he finds out that Arago is doing stuff. Now, Biot is actually the better scientist</p>
<p>in a lot of ways, but Arago is furious about this. So furious that he actually demands and</p>
<p>forces the leader of French science, Laplace, the Marquis de Laplace and cohorts to write a note in</p>
<p>the published journal saying, oh, excuse us, actually Arago, et cetera, et cetera, blah, blah.</p>
<p>So Arago continues to just hold this antipathy and fear of Biot. So what happens? 1815,</p>
<p>Napoleon is finished at Waterloo. A young Frenchman by the name of Augustin Fresnel</p>
<p>who was in the army is going back to his home on the north coast of France in Normandy,</p>
<p>passes through Paris. Arago is friends with Fresnel&rsquo;s uncle who&rsquo;s the head of the √âcole des</p>
<p>Beaux Arts at the time. Anyway, Fresnel is already interested in certain things in light</p>
<p>and he talks to Arago. Arago tells him a few things. Fresnel goes home and Fresnel is a</p>
<p>brilliant experimenter. He observes things and he&rsquo;s a very good mathematician, calculates things,</p>
<p>he writes something up, he sends it to Arago. Arago looks at it and Arago says to himself,</p>
<p>I can use this to get back at Biot. He brings Fresnel to Paris, sets him up in</p>
<p>a room at the observatory where Arago is for Fresnel to continue his work. Paper after paper</p>
<p>comes out undercutting everything Biot had done. What is it about jealousy and just envy that</p>
<p>could be an engine of creativity and productivity versus like an Einstein where it seems like not?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know which one is better. I guess it depends on the personality. Both are useful</p>
<p>engines in science. Well, in this particular story, it&rsquo;s maybe even more interesting because</p>
<p>Fresnel himself, the young guy, he knew what Arago was doing with him and he didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t want to get with, he wrote his brother said, I don&rsquo;t want to get in an argument with Biot,</p>
<p>I just want to do my stuff. Arago is using him, but it&rsquo;s because Arago kept pushing him to go</p>
<p>into certain areas that stuff kept coming out. Yeah. Ego is beautiful. Okay. But back to Newton,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of things I want to ask, but sort of, let&rsquo;s say since we&rsquo;re on the Leibniz</p>
<p>and the topic of drama, let me ask another drama question. Why was Newton a complicated man?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re breaking news today. This is like. Right. Why was he complicated? His</p>
<p>brain structure was different. I don&rsquo;t know why. He had a complicated young life, as we&rsquo;ve said.</p>
<p>He had always been very self contained and solitary. He had acquaintances and friends.</p>
<p>And when he moved to London eventually, he had quite a career. A career, for instance, that led</p>
<p>him when he was famous by then, the 1690s, he moves to London. He becomes first warden of the</p>
<p>mint. The mint is what produces coins and coinage was a complicated thing because there was</p>
<p>counterfeiting going on. And he becomes master of the mint to the extent. And a guy at MIT wrote a</p>
<p>book about this a little bit. We wrote something on it too. I forget his name was Levin. That Newton</p>
<p>sent investigators out to catch these guys and sent at least one of them, a famous one named</p>
<p>Challener to the gallows. And one of the reasons he probably was so particularly angry at Challener</p>
<p>was Challener had apparently said some nasty things about Newton in front of parliament at</p>
<p>some point. Fair enough. That was apparently not a good idea. Well, he had a bit of a temper. So</p>
<p>you had a bit of a temper. Clearly. But he even as a young man at Cambridge, though he doesn&rsquo;t come</p>
<p>from wealth, he attracts people who recognize his smarts. There&rsquo;s a young fellow named Humphrey</p>
<p>Newton shared his rooms. These students always shared rooms with one another, became his kind</p>
<p>of amanuensis to write down what Newton was doing and so on. And there were others over time who he</p>
<p>befriended in various ways and so on. He was solitary. He had, as far as we know, no relationships</p>
<p>with either women or men in anything other than a formal way. The only&hellip;</p>
<p>Those get in the way relationships.</p>
<p>Right. Well, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if he was close to his mother. I mean, she passed away,</p>
<p>everything left him. He went to be with her after she died. He was close to his niece,</p>
<p>Catherine Barton, who basically came to run his household when he moved to London and so on. And</p>
<p>she married a man named Conduit, who became one of the people who controlled Newton&rsquo;s legacy</p>
<p>later on and so on. And you can even see the townhouse that Newton lived in, in those days,</p>
<p>still there.</p>
<p>All right. So there&rsquo;s the story of Newton coming up with quite a few ideas during a pandemic.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on the outskirts of a pandemic ourselves.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And a lot of people use that example as motivation for everybody while they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in lockdown to get stuff done. So what&rsquo;s that about? Can you tell the story of that?</p>
<p>Well, I can. Let me first say that, of course, we&rsquo;ve been teaching over Zoom lately.</p>
<p>There was no Zoom back then?</p>
<p>There was no Zoom back then. Although it wouldn&rsquo;t have made much difference because the story was</p>
<p>Newton was so complicated in his lectures that at one point, Humphrey Newton actually said that</p>
<p>he might as well have just been lecturing to the walls because nobody was there</p>
<p>to listen to it. So what difference?</p>
<p>Also not a great teacher, huh?</p>
<p>If you look at his optical notes, if that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s reading from&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, boy. Okay.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So what can you say about that whole journey through the pandemic that resulted in so much</p>
<p>innovation in such a short amount of time?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, there&rsquo;s two times that he goes home. Would he have been able to do it and do do it if</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d stayed at Cambridge? I think he would have. I don&rsquo;t think it really&hellip; Although I do like to</p>
<p>tell my advanced students when I lecture on the history of physics to the physics and chemistry</p>
<p>students, especially we&rsquo;ve been doing it over Zoom last year, when we get to Newton and so on,</p>
<p>because these kids are, you know, 21, 22, I like to say, well, you know, when Newton was your age</p>
<p>and he had to go home during an epidemic, do you know what he produced?</p>
<p>So can you actually summarize this for people who don&rsquo;t know how old was Newton and what did</p>
<p>he produce? Well, Newton goes up to Cambridge, as it said, when he&rsquo;s 18 years old in 1660.</p>
<p>And the so called miraculous year, the annus mirabilis, where you get the development</p>
<p>in the calculus and in optical discoveries, especially, is 1666, right? So he&rsquo;s, what,</p>
<p>24 years old at the time. But judging from the notebooks that I mentioned, he&rsquo;s already,</p>
<p>before that, come to an awful lot of developments over the previous couple of years.</p>
<p>Does it have much to do with the fact that he twice went home? It is true that the optical</p>
<p>experiments that we talked of a while ago with the light on the wall moving up and down were done at</p>
<p>home. In fact, you can visit the very room he did it in to this day. Yeah, it&rsquo;s very cool.</p>
<p>And if you look through the window in that room, there is an apple tree out there in the garden.</p>
<p>So you might be wrong about this. You&rsquo;re lying to me. Maybe there&rsquo;s an apple</p>
<p>involved after all. Well, it&rsquo;s not the same apple tree, but it&rsquo;s cuttings.</p>
<p>How do you know?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t last that long, but it&rsquo;s 400 years ago.</p>
<p>Oh, wow. I continue with the dumbest questions. Okay. So you&rsquo;re saying that perhaps going home</p>
<p>was not&hellip; It may have given him an opportunity to work things through. And after all, he did make</p>
<p>use of that room and he could do things like put a shade over the window, move things around,</p>
<p>cut holes in it and do stuff. Probably in his rooms at Cambridge, maybe not. Although when he</p>
<p>stayed at Cambridge subsequently and became a fellow, and then the second Lucasian professor</p>
<p>there, he was actually really the first one because Isaac Barrow, who was the mathematician,</p>
<p>professor of optics who recognized Newton&rsquo;s genius, gave up what would have been his position</p>
<p>because he recognized&hellip; Newton may not have learned too much from him, although they did</p>
<p>interact. And so Newton was the first Lucasian professor really, the one that Stephen Hawking</p>
<p>held till he died. And we know that the rooms that he had there at Cambridge subsequently,</p>
<p>those rooms are still there, he built an all chemical furnace outside, did all sorts of stuff</p>
<p>in those rooms. And don&rsquo;t forget, you didn&rsquo;t have to do too much as a Lucasian professor.</p>
<p>Every so often you had to go give these lectures, whether anybody was there or not,</p>
<p>and deposit the notes for the future, which is how we have all those things.</p>
<p>Oh, they were stored and now we have them. And now we know just how terrible of a teacher Newton</p>
<p>was. Yeah, but we know how brilliant these notes are. In fact, the second volume of Newton&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>of the notes really on the great book that he published, The Optics, which he published in 1704,</p>
<p>that has just been finished with full annotations and analysis by the greatest analyst of Newton&rsquo;s</p>
<p>optics, Alan Shapiro, who retired a few years ago at the University of Minnesota and been working</p>
<p>on Newton&rsquo;s optics ever since I knew him and before, and I&rsquo;ve known him since 1976.</p>
<p>Is there something you could say broadly about either that work on optics or Principia itself</p>
<p>as something that I&rsquo;ve never actually looked at as a piece of work?</p>
<p>Is it powerful in itself or is it just an important moment in history in terms of the</p>
<p>amount of inventions that are within, the amount of ideas that are within, or is it a really powerful</p>
<p>work in itself? Well, it is a powerful work in itself. You can see this guy coming to grips with</p>
<p>and pushing through and working his way around complicated and difficult issues, melding</p>
<p>experimental situations which nobody had worked with before, even discovering new things,</p>
<p>trying to figure out ways of putting this together with mathematical structures,</p>
<p>succeeding and failing at the same time. And we can see him doing that.</p>
<p>I mean, what is, what is contained within Principia? I don&rsquo;t even know in terms of the</p>
<p>scope of the work. Is it the entirety of the body of work of Newton?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no. The Principia Mathematica&hellip;</p>
<p>Is it calculus?</p>
<p>Well, all right. So the Principia is divided into three books.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Book one contains his version of the laws of motion and the application of those laws</p>
<p>to figure out when a body moves in certain curves and is forced to move in those curves</p>
<p>by forces directed to certain fixed points, what is the nature of the mathematical formula</p>
<p>for those forces? That&rsquo;s all that book one is about. And it contains not the kind of version</p>
<p>of the calculus that uses algebra of the sort that I was trying to explain before,</p>
<p>but is done in terms of ratios between geometric line segments when one of the line segments goes</p>
<p>very, very small. It&rsquo;s called the kind of limiting procedure, which is calculus, but it&rsquo;s a geometrically</p>
<p>structured, although it&rsquo;s clearly got algebraic elements in it as well. And that makes the</p>
<p>Principia&rsquo;s mathematical structure rather hard for people who aren&rsquo;t studying it today to</p>
<p>go back to. Book two contains his work on what we now call hydrostatics and a little bit about</p>
<p>hydrodynamics, a fuller development of the concept of pressure, which is a complicated concept.</p>
<p>And book three applies what he did in book one to the solar system. And it is successful</p>
<p>partially because the only way that you can exactly solve, the only types of problems you</p>
<p>can exactly solve in terms of the interactions of two particles governed by gravitational force</p>
<p>between them is for only two bodies. If there&rsquo;s more than two, let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s A, B, and C,</p>
<p>A acts on B, B acts on C, C acts on A, you cannot solve it exactly. You have to develop techniques.</p>
<p>The fullest sets of techniques are really only developed about 30 or 40 years after Newton&rsquo;s</p>
<p>death by French mathematicians like Laplace. Newton tried to apply his structure to the</p>
<p>sun, earth, moon, because the moon&rsquo;s motion is very complicated. The moon, for instance,</p>
<p>exactly repeats its observable position among the stars only every 19 years.</p>
<p>That is, if you look up where the moon is among the stars at certain times and it changes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s complicated. That&rsquo;s, by the way, that was discovered by the Babylonians.</p>
<p>That fact, the 19 years.</p>
<p>Thousands of years ago, yes.</p>
<p>And then you have to load that little piece of data and how do you make sense of it? I mean,</p>
<p>that is data and you have to fit it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s complicated. So Newton actually kind of reverse engineered a technique that had been</p>
<p>developed by a man named Horrocks, using certain laws of Kepler&rsquo;s to try and get around this thing.</p>
<p>And Newton then sort of, my understanding, I&rsquo;ve never studied this, has reversed,</p>
<p>sort of reversed it and fit it together with his force calculations by way of an approximation.</p>
<p>And was able to construct a model to make some predictions?</p>
<p>It fit things backwards pretty well.</p>
<p>Okay. Where does data fit into this? We kind of earlier in the discussion</p>
<p>mentioned data as part of the scientific method. How important was data to Newton?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So like you mentioned Prism and playing with it and looking at stuff and then coming up with</p>
<p>calculations and so on. Where does data fit into any of his ideas?</p>
<p>All right. Well, let me say two things first. One, we rarely use the phrase scientific method</p>
<p>anymore because there is no one easily describable such method. I mean, humans have been</p>
<p>playing around with the world and learning how to repetitively do things and make things happen</p>
<p>ever since, you know, humans became humans.</p>
<p>Do you have a preferred definition of the scientific method?</p>
<p>Do you have a preferred definition of the scientific method? What are the various?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t. I prefer to talk about</p>
<p>the considered manipulation of artificial structures to produce results that can be</p>
<p>worked together with schemes to construct other devices and make</p>
<p>predictions, if you will, about the way such things will work.</p>
<p>So ultimately, it&rsquo;s about producing other devices. It&rsquo;s like leads you down a&hellip;</p>
<p>I think so, principally. I mean, you may have data, if you will, like astronomical data</p>
<p>obtained otherwise and so on, but yes. But number two here is this question of data. What is data</p>
<p>in that sense? See, when we talk about data today, we have a kind of complex notion, which</p>
<p>reverts to even issues of statistics and measurement procedures and so on. So let me put it to you this</p>
<p>way. So let&rsquo;s say I had a ruler in front of me and it&rsquo;s marked off in little black marks separated</p>
<p>by, let&rsquo;s say, distances called a millimeter. Okay. Now I make a mark on this piece of paper here.</p>
<p>So I made a nice black mark, right? Nice black mark. And I ask you, I want you to measure that</p>
<p>and tell me how long it is. You&rsquo;re going to take the ruler, you&rsquo;re going to put it next to it,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to look, and it&rsquo;s not going to sit, even if you put one end in the middle,</p>
<p>even if you put one end as close as you can on one black mark, the other end probably isn&rsquo;t going to</p>
<p>be exactly on a black mark. Well, you&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s closer to this or that. You&rsquo;ll write down a number</p>
<p>and I say, okay, take the ruler away a minute. I take this away, come back in five minutes,</p>
<p>put the piece of paper down, do it again. You&rsquo;re going to probably come up with a different number</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to do that a lot of times. And then if I tell you, I want you to give me your</p>
<p>best estimate of what the actual length of that thing is, what are you going to do?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to average all of these numbers. Why?</p>
<p>Statistics.</p>
<p>Well, yes, statistics. There&rsquo;s lots of ways of going around it,</p>
<p>but the average is the best estimate on the basis of what&rsquo;s called the central limit theorem,</p>
<p>a statistical theorem. We&rsquo;re talking about things that were not really developed until the 1750s,</p>
<p>60s and 70s. Newton died in 1727.</p>
<p>The intuition perhaps was there.</p>
<p>Not really. I&rsquo;ll tell you what people did, including Newton, although Newton is</p>
<p>partially the one exception. We talked a while ago about this guy, Christian Huygens.</p>
<p>He measured lots of things and he was a good mechanic himself. He and his brother ground</p>
<p>lenses. Huygens, I told you, developed the first pendulum mechanism, pendulum driven clock with a</p>
<p>mechanism and so on. Also a spring watch where he got into a controversy with Hooke over that,</p>
<p>by the way.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s with these mechanics and the controversy?</p>
<p>Well, we also have Huygens&rsquo;s notes. They&rsquo;re preserved at Leiden University in Holland,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s Dutch, for his work in optics, which was extensive. We don&rsquo;t have time to go into that,</p>
<p>except the following. A number of years ago, I went through those things because</p>
<p>in this optical theory that he had, there are four numbers that you&rsquo;ve got to be able to get</p>
<p>good numbers on to be able to predict other things. What would we do today? What in fact</p>
<p>was done at the end of the 18th century when somebody went back to this? I told you to do</p>
<p>with the ruler. You make a lot of measurements and average results. We have Huygens&rsquo;s notes.</p>
<p>He did make a lot of measurements, one after the other, after the other. But when he came to use</p>
<p>the numbers for calculations, and indeed when he published things at the end of his life,</p>
<p>he gives you one number and it&rsquo;s not the average of any of them. It&rsquo;s just one of them. Which one</p>
<p>was it? The one that he thought he got so good at working by practice that he put down the one he</p>
<p>was most confident in. That was the general procedure at the time. You wouldn&rsquo;t publish</p>
<p>a paper in which you wrote down six numbers and said, well, I measured this six times.</p>
<p>Let me put them together. None of them is really, they would have said, the right number,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll put them together and give you a good number. No, you would have been thought of that,</p>
<p>you know, you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing. Yeah. By the way, there&rsquo;s just an inkling of value to</p>
<p>that approach. Just an inkling. We sometimes use statistics as like a thing that like, oh,</p>
<p>that solves all the problems. We&rsquo;ll just do a lot of it and we&rsquo;ll take the average or whatever it</p>
<p>is. As many excellent books on mathematics have highlighted the flaws in our approach to certain</p>
<p>sciences that rely heavily on statistics. Okay. Let me ask you again for a friend about this</p>
<p>alchemy thing. You know, it&rsquo;d be nice to create gold, but it also seems to come into play quite</p>
<p>a bit throughout the history of science, perhaps in positive ways in terms of its impact. Can you</p>
<p>say something to the history of alchemy? A little bit. Sure. It used to be thought two things. One,</p>
<p>that alchemy, which dates certainly back to the Islamic period in Islam, you&rsquo;re talking, you know,</p>
<p>11th, 12th, 13th centuries among Islamic natural philosophers and experimenters.</p>
<p>But it used to be thought that alchemy, which picked up strikingly in the 16th century, 1500s</p>
<p>and thereabouts, was a sort of mystical procedure involving all sorts of strange notions and so on.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not entirely untrue, but it is substantially untrue in that alchemists were</p>
<p>engaged in what was known as chrysopoeia, that is looking for ways to transform invaluable materials</p>
<p>into valuable ones. But in the process of doing so or attempting to do so, they learned how to</p>
<p>create complex amalgams of various kinds. They used very elaborate apparatus, glass</p>
<p>alembics in which they would use heat to produce chemical decompositions. They would write down and</p>
<p>observe these compositions. And many of the so called really strange looking alchemical formulas</p>
<p>and statements where they&rsquo;ll say something like, I can&rsquo;t produce it, but it&rsquo;ll be the soul of</p>
<p>Mars will combine with this, et cetera, et cetera. These, it has been shown, are almost all actual</p>
<p>formulas for how to engage in the production of complex amalgams and what to do. And by the time</p>
<p>of Newton, Newton was reading the works of a fellow by the name of Starkey, who actually came</p>
<p>from Harvard shortly before, in which things had progressed, if you will, to the point where</p>
<p>the procedure turns into what historians call chrysopoeia, which basically runs into the notion</p>
<p>of thinking that these things are made out of particles. This is the mechanical philosophy.</p>
<p>This is the mechanical philosophy. Can we engage in processes, chemical processes to rearrange these</p>
<p>things, which is not so stupid after all. I mean, we do it, except we happen to do it in reactors,</p>
<p>not in chemical processes, unless of course it had happened that cold fusion had worked,</p>
<p>which it didn&rsquo;t. Not yet. Well, right. So that&rsquo;s the way they&rsquo;re thinking about these things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of mix. And Newton engages extensively in those sorts of manipulations.</p>
<p>In fact, more in that than almost anything else, except for his optical investigations. If you look</p>
<p>through the latter parts of the 1670s, the last five, six, seven years or so of that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more on that than there is on anything else. He&rsquo;s not working on mechanics. He&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>much gone pretty far in optics. He&rsquo;ll turn back to optics later on. So optics and alchemy.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re saying is Isaac Newton liked shiny things. Well, actually, if you go online and look</p>
<p>at what Bill Newman, the professor at Indiana, at Bloomington, Indiana has produced, you&rsquo;ll find</p>
<p>the very shiny thing called the star regulus, which Newton describes as having produced according to</p>
<p>a particular way, which Newman figured out and was able to do it. And it&rsquo;s very shiny.</p>
<p>There you go. Proves the theorem. Can I ask you about God, religion and its role in Newton&rsquo;s life?</p>
<p>Was there helpful, constructive or destructive influences of religion in his work and in his life?</p>
<p>Well, there you begin to touch on a complex question. The role that God played would be an</p>
<p>interesting question to answer should one go and be able to speak with this invisible character</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t exist. But putting that aside for the moment. Yeah, we don&rsquo;t like to talk about others</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re not here. So, right. Newton is a deeply religious man, not unusually so,</p>
<p>of course, for the time. And clearly, his upbringing and perhaps his early experiences</p>
<p>have exacerbated that in a number of ways that he takes a lot of things personally. And he finds</p>
<p>perhaps solace in thinking about a sort of governing, abstract, rulemaking, exacting deity.</p>
<p>I think there is little question that his conviction that you can figure things out has</p>
<p>a fair bit to do with his profound belief that this rulemaker doesn&rsquo;t do things arbitrarily.</p>
<p>Newton does not think that miracles have happened since maybe the time of Christ, if then,</p>
<p>and not in the same way. He was, for instance, an anti Trinitarian. He did not hold that Christ</p>
<p>had a divine being, but was rather endowed with certain powers by the rulemaker and whatnot.</p>
<p>And he did not think that some of the tales of the Old Testament with various miracles and so on</p>
<p>occurred in anything like that way. Some may have, some may not have. Like everybody else,</p>
<p>of course, he did think that creation had happened about 6,000 years ago. Wait, really? Oh, yeah,</p>
<p>sure. Well, biblical chronology can give you a little bit about that. It&rsquo;s a little controversial,</p>
<p>but sure. Interesting. Wow. The deity created the universe 6,000 years ago. And that didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>interfere with his playing around with the sun and the moon? No, because he&rsquo;s figuring out,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s watching the brilliant construction that this perfect entity did 6,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Yeah, has produced. Plus or minus a few years. Well, if you go with Bishop Boster, it&rsquo;s 4004 BCE.</p>
<p>Want to be precise about it. We always, and this is a serious program, we always want to be precise.</p>
<p>Okay. Let me ask another ridiculous question. If Newton were to travel forward in time</p>
<p>and visit with Einstein and have a discussion about space time and general relativity,</p>
<p>that conception of time and that conception of gravity, what do you think that discussion will go</p>
<p>like? Put that way, I think Newton would sit there in shock and say, I have no idea what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about. If on the other hand, there&rsquo;s a time machine, you go back and bring a somewhat</p>
<p>younger Newton, not a man my age, say. I mean, he lived a long time into his mid eighties,</p>
<p>but take him when he&rsquo;s in his forties, let&rsquo;s say, bring him forward and don&rsquo;t immediately</p>
<p>introduce him to Einstein. Let&rsquo;s take him for a ride on a railroad. Let him experience the</p>
<p>railroad. Oh, that&rsquo;s right. Take him around and show him a sparking machine. He knows about sparks,</p>
<p>sending off sparks. Show him wires, have him touch the wires and get a little shock.</p>
<p>Show him a clicking telegraph machine of the kind. Then let him hear the clicks in a telephone</p>
<p>receiver and so on. Do that for a couple of months. Let him get accustomed to things.</p>
<p>Then take him into, not Einstein yet, let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re taking him into the 1890s. Einstein is</p>
<p>young man then. We take him into some of the laboratories. We show him some of the equipment,</p>
<p>the devices, not the most elaborate ones. We show him certain things. We educate him</p>
<p>bit by bit. On optics, maybe focus on that. Certainly on optics. You begin to show him</p>
<p>things. He&rsquo;s a brilliant human being. I think bit by bit, he would begin to see what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>But if you just dumped him in front of Einstein, he&rsquo;d sit there, his eyes would glaze over.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess it&rsquo;s almost a question of how big of a leap, how many leaps have been taken</p>
<p>in science that go from Newton to Einstein. We sometimes in a compressed version of history</p>
<p>think that not much. Oh, that&rsquo;s totally wrong. A lot. Huge amounts in multifarious ways</p>
<p>involving fundamental conceptions, mathematical structures, the evolution of novel experimentation</p>
<p>and devices, the organization. It&rsquo;s not everything. Everything. I mean, to a point where I wonder</p>
<p>even if Newton was like, you said 40, but even like 30. So he&rsquo;s very, like if you would be able</p>
<p>to catch up with the conception of everything. I wonder as a scientist, how much you load in from</p>
<p>age five about this world in order to be able to conceive of the world of ideas that push that</p>
<p>science forward. I mean, you mentioned the railroad and all those kinds of things. That might be</p>
<p>fundamental to our ability to invent even when it doesn&rsquo;t directly obviously seem relevant.</p>
<p>Well, yes. I mean, the railroad, the steam engine, the Watt engine, et cetera. I mean,</p>
<p>that was really the Watt engine was developed pretty&hellip; Although Watt knew Joseph Black,</p>
<p>a chemist scientist and so on, did stuff on heat, was developed pretty much independently of</p>
<p>the developing thoughts about heat at the time. But what it&rsquo;s not independent of is the evolution</p>
<p>of practice in the manufacture and construction of devices which can do things in extraordinarily</p>
<p>novel ways and the premium being gradually placed on calculating how you can make them more</p>
<p>efficient. That is of a piece with a way of thinking about the world in which you&rsquo;re controlling</p>
<p>things and working it. It&rsquo;s something that humans have been doing for a long time, but in this more</p>
<p>concerted and structured way, I think you really don&rsquo;t find it in the fullest sense until well into</p>
<p>the 1500s and really not fully until the 17th century later on. So Newton had this year of</p>
<p>miracles. I wonder if I could ask you briefly about Einstein and his year of miracles. I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been reading, re reading, revisiting the brilliance of the papers that Einstein published in the year</p>
<p>1905, one of which won him the Nobel prize, the photoelectric effect, but also Brownian motion,</p>
<p>special theory of relativity, and of course the old E equals MC squared.</p>
<p>Does that make sense to you that these two figures had such productive years</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s this moment of genius? Maybe, maybe if we zoom out, I mean, I, my work is very much</p>
<p>in artificial intelligence, sort of wondering about the nature of intelligence. Like how did we,</p>
<p>how did evolution on earth produce genius that could come up with so much in so little time?</p>
<p>To me, that gives me hope that one person can change the world in such a small amount of time.</p>
<p>Well, of course there are precedents for, in both Newton&rsquo;s and Einstein&rsquo;s cases for elements of</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re finding there. It&rsquo;s, you know, and so on. Well, I have no idea. You know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you must&rsquo;ve read, it was a kind of a famous story that after Einstein died,</p>
<p>he donated his brain and they sliced it up to see if they could find something unusual there,</p>
<p>nothing unusual visibly in there. So I have, clearly there are people who for various reasons,</p>
<p>maybe both intrinsic and extrinsic in the sense of experience and so on, are capable of coming</p>
<p>up with these extraordinary results. Many years ago, when I was a student, a friend of mine came</p>
<p>in and said, did you read about, did you read this? I forget what, anyway, there was a story</p>
<p>in the paper. It was about, I think it was a young woman who was, she couldn&rsquo;t speak and she was</p>
<p>somewhere on the autism spectrum. She could not read other people&rsquo;s affect in any ways, but she</p>
<p>could sit down at a piano and having heard it once and then run variations on the most complex</p>
<p>pianistic works of Chopin and others, right? Now how?</p>
<p>Some aspect of our mind is able to tune in in some aspect of reality and become a master of it.</p>
<p>And every once in a while, that means coming up with breakthrough ideas in physics.</p>
<p>Yep. How the heck does that happen? Who knows? Jed, I&rsquo;d like to say thank you so much for spending</p>
<p>your valuable time with me today. It was a really fascinating conversation. I&rsquo;ve learned so much</p>
<p>about Isaac Newton, who&rsquo;s one of the most fascinating figures in human history. So</p>
<p>thank you so much for talking to me. My pleasure. I enjoyed it very much.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jed Buchwald. To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from</p>
<p>Thomas Kuhn, a philosopher of science. The answers you get depend on the questions you ask.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
