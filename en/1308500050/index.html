    <p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> I operate under the fundamental assumption that all companies are terrible, that ‚Äì all of the ones ever created, which you know, like, some people don‚Äôt love me saying this, but like I think, to me, this is actually inspiring because, boy, building companies is worth it. Like, it‚Äôs like, I mean, all innovation around us is like ‚Äì it comes from companies. It comes from journeys, it comes from ‚Äì like entrepreneurships and builders getting together.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I‚Äôm your host, Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft.</p>
<p>In this podcast, we‚Äôre going to get behind the tech. We‚Äôll talk with some of the people who have made our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they did. So, join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind-the-scenes insights into what‚Äôs happening today. Stick around.</p>
<p>[MUSIC]</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> Hello, welcome to Behind The Tech. I‚Äôm cohost Christina Warren, Senior Developer Advocate at GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> And I‚Äôm Kevin Scott.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> And we are kicking off 2023 with an insightful conversation with Tobi L√ºtke, who is the CEO and founder of the Canadian e‚Äìcommerce company, Shopify.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, I‚Äôve been really looking forward to this conversation. Tobi and I have known each other for a few years. The company that he runs is sort of amazing. Like, I love anyone who is doing work, building platforms to help people run their businesses to you know, just empower them to do more of what they want. And I think Shopify is a really great company on that front.</p>
<p>But Tobi is a really unique CEO. He is a programmer and computer scientist by training, and, like, he just is deeply invested in his programmer roots. And I think you‚Äôre going to hear a bunch of that in our conversation. He‚Äôs a very unusual and impressive CEO.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> I‚Äôm super, super excited. All right, let‚Äôs dive into your conversation with Tobi.</p>
<p>[MUSIC]</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Tobi L√ºtke is the CEO and Founder of Shopify, the Canadian multinational ecommerce platform that helps companies set up and run online stores. Growing up in Germany, he spent his time as a teacher, tinkering with computers and writing code. Tobi began his career as an entrepreneur when he and a friend decided to design an ecommerce platform to sell snowboards which eventually evolved into the concept that built Shopify.</p>
<p>As a programmer, Tobi has served on the core team of the Ruby on Rails framework and has created many popular opensource libraries. I‚Äôve been looking forward to this conversation for a really long while. Thank you for joining us, Tobi, and apologies in advance ‚Äì we&rsquo;re doing this from my lab which can sometimes get a little bit noisy.</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> Thanks for having me.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> So we always start these conversations by going all the way back to what inspired you or how you go the spark to, you know, get interested in science and technology. So tell us a little bit about that.</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> Yeah, I had ‚Äì you‚Äôd have to go all the way back. I got really lucky. So my dad is a doctor and he had - and this is in Germany - we had Macintosh in the house. These were sort of LC1 variety, you know, (inaudible) in the ‚Äì growing up in the ‚Äò80s, and I just like ‚Äì I mean, there was no other magical object that existed on planet Earth that had nearly ‚Äì this draw on me, right? It‚Äôs like it just was ‚Äì it was an interesting experience, going into the ‚Äò80s and ‚Äò90s.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, and so what ‚Äì and so you were ‚Äì you started out with Macintosh programming, so what was it, MPW Pascal, was it HyperCard, what was your ‚Äì</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> Exactly, it‚Äôs ‚Äì the usual suspects, but HyperCard was ‚Äì like, you know, the whole concept of. I mean, I made HyperCard index cards for learning my Latin vocab ‚Äì conjugations, and you know, shared them with the other kids that had a monitor, and a ‚Äì but like, pretty quickly I found, like BASIC and Pascal, like eventually. I don‚Äôt think I was any good at it, and like I was pretty young during those days.</p>
<p>But you know, just like the ‚Äì the spark really happened then. You know, the German version of <em>Byte</em> magazine ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know if that was the same in North America. They often had listings in the back, you know, just ‚Äì often, like a little videogame or something, and I would type them into my BASIC interpreter. I had, at this point, this BASIC computer. It‚Äôs called an Amstrad CPC, which again is kind of a European thing.</p>
<p>And you know, just like I very naturally started like ‚Äì you know, to play the thing after it runs, and this is magic, and then you beat it, and you make it harder, and ‚Äì and it ‚Äì it was only like years and years later that someone told me this is called programming and has a name. This was just like using computers. And you ran out of things to do pretty quickly, so this is what I gravitated to.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, and it‚Äôs really interesting. In our generation, I think that is a fairly common experience. Like oftentimes, like games were the, you know, sort of provocative thing that captured your attention, and then it‚Äôs just sort of hacking around with these systems, not even realizing that what ‚Äì well, none of us certainly realized that what we were doing then we‚Äôre going to inform, like all of the crazy stuff that we do now, right?</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> Definitely not, but like it did feel, especially going from the ‚Äò90s, a little bit ‚Äì which probably looked very different. Again, I‚Äôm from a small town, and ‚Äì and really didn‚Äôt know anyone who was into computers in a similar way I was. And we were connected through, you know, dialup modems, BBSs and so on, very quick download messages and it ‚Äì sort of there was a bridge to Usenet.</p>
<p>So you were this outside observer to ‚Äì you know more was going on, but you know, you were stepped out ‚Äì like away from my bedroom, and the world wasn‚Äôt changing. And ‚Äì and people were ‚Äì I remember very early in my teenage years that I had this realization where, you know what? The adults are ‚Äì they do not understand what‚Äôs coming. Because just it was just so obvious that everything would change, given this thing which was just simply not possible before.</p>
<p>And you know, you could play the party tricks, where ‚Äì especially with things like HyperCard, where, you know, some data entry job, you just made it like basically go away, and ‚Äì but it was clear that there was more value there, and that this would have a much, much bigger impact in ‚Äì like in the future.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> And so I‚Äôm curious. So the German education system is a little bit different from the U.S. education system, so at some point, when you‚Äôre a kid you get selected, and it‚Äôs just always been unclear to me, like how much of a choice the student has, versus how much the system is sort of deciding for you, whether you‚Äôre going to go do <em>Fachhochschule</em>, which is this vocational track, or you‚Äôre going to <em>Gymnasium</em>, which prepares you to go to university.</p>
<p>So I presume you went on the <em>Gymnasium</em> track. Was there anything in <em>Gymnasium</em> when you went to, effectively, high school that was, you know, helps you learn programing, or you know, get you interested in computer science?</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> Yeah, not ‚Äì not in my experience. I mean, I‚Äôm sure obviously, it‚Äôs changed now, but like I was initially eventually ‚Äì this is a really interesting meta topic, which is that Europe has a ‚Äì especially this Germanic region of Europe, this sort of heritage of the craft is very different, and it‚Äôs, North America does not understand it well.</p>
<p>I know this for a fact because I have to constantly re-explain this because I, inside of Shopify, it‚Äôs ‚Äì it‚Äôs well established that you have to kind of understand what vocation is and what craft is, in the European sense, to really understand the way the company thinks about itself.</p>
<p>So but anyway, I went into this more academic <em>Gymnasium</em> track initially, but I‚Äôm just sort of hands-on. I would tinker. I‚Äôm not, I don‚Äôt ‚Äì it‚Äôs, academia for academia‚Äôs sake is not for me, and ‚Äì so I wanted to go, like more into the practical side. I found out that if you switch, I think after like ninth grade or eighth grade, I switched into the more vocational track of school, and then we did practicals and then ‚Äì like I actually worked at a Siemens subsidiary for like a couple of ‚Äì like for a month or so, which was just the most magical thing to me.</p>
<p>And it was clear that I wanted to leave school as soon as I could because it, just everyone was teaching things that were just kind of the exact things that I didn‚Äôt think would be super relevant in the future, and then the wisdom of a vocational system allows you to leave school after tenth grade and start as an apprentice.</p>
<p>And so that‚Äôs what I did. I was actually ‚Äì most, like the first year where computer programming was taught as a craft, in the vocation system, and I‚Äôm so glad that I hit that particular timing window because things would have gone very different otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> This whole idea of computer science and programming is just a huge category, and I‚Äôve always wondered for ‚Äì for myself, like I‚Äôm also practically inclined.</p>
<p>Like I like to write code. You know, it‚Äôs why I studied compilers versus theoretical computer science. It was like this perfect mix of you‚Äôve got a little bit of theory that was sort of intellectually satisfying, but at the end of the day, the thing that you wanted to do was like build a compiler and optimization pass, or like something, and in the very truest sense. Like you‚Äôre building a tool for other people to pick up and use to do their craft.</p>
<p>And so like, I‚Äôve always thought of it as craft, but some of it is art, and I do think some of it is like legitimately science, and there‚Äôs like this blurry boundary between all of them, but like treating it ‚Äì treating it as if like all of it is this sort of wholly academic scientific thing, always. It just never appealed to me.</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> Yeah, I think it‚Äôs a side effect of a way academia sorted itself, right? Like, it ‚Äì they had to put it in some building when computation came around, not realizing that it probably ought to have had its own building because there‚Äôs a lot of different things that it needed, and I think the people that don‚Äôt doggedly, like associate themselves with like this ‚Äì we‚Äôre a scientist, we do science-y things, but rather follow the value ‚Äì you know, like treat all these different disciplines as like sources of inspiration and energy and value, and ‚Äì and pull it from all of them, just to get the task done.</p>
<p>Those are hugely the vocational people, right? And I think this is something we ‚Äì like I think we see this, you know, in a lot of places. I mean, take a very recent example. I feel like machine learning is currently being like recaptured by the tinkerers, and with much more of a vocational bent, because being able to do cool things with their own GPUs, rather than calling APIs, and you know, many of the greatest things will not be used like this, this way, because they‚Äôre just too big for machines, but just the ability for people to start tinkering, just leads to all sorts of better tooling and better ‚Äì like great writing.</p>
<p>And like people from different backgrounds entering the machine learning area, which obviously is the kind of created melting points for ‚Äì where suddenly focus accelerates.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, and I think, look, it leads to better applications as well. So one of the things that I really strongly believe about all of the stuff that‚Äôs happening in AI and machine learning right now is, if we can‚Äôt make what we‚Äôre doing into an accessible platform for people to do this tinkering ‚Äì you know, whether it‚Äôs ‚Äì you know, you‚Äôre downloading a copy of Stable Diffusion, and you know, getting it to run on your own machine, on your own GPU card, plugged into your PC, or it‚Äôs calling someone else‚Äôs API.</p>
<p>Like the API calls have to be unrestricted enough and cheap enough where you can just tinker. You know, if we can‚Äôt do that, you‚Äôre not going to really get the full breadth of the interesting stuff that‚Äôs sitting in people‚Äôs imaginations that they don‚Äôt even know is there.</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> Absolutely. The core of a craft is like converting something into something, right? Like, like any craft that exists is sort of a ‚Äì that particular process is like people who convert wood into furniture are carpenters.</p>
<p>One thing which is really inspired about these things is that they really ‚Äì it‚Äôs the identity of a carpenter, that they are a carpenter. Their identity is actually that they‚Äôre a craftsperson, and that the particular craft that they are ‚Äì that they‚Äôve pursued, and that they‚Äôve done their ‚Äì they become a master in, it‚Äôs usually just their aptitude, and it‚Äôs a very common type of person, which is also really useful, because therefore some crafts exist for a moment, and then they don‚Äôt exist anymore, they‚Äôre no longer needed.</p>
<p>Like the blacksmith has finally figured out what to do next. And so I think that‚Äôs ‚Äì like all of this is actually really worth sort of understanding, and because ‚Äì you know, like I sometimes talk to, you know, junior engineers who describe themselves as, &ldquo;I‚Äôm a React front-end developer,&rdquo; and like, &ldquo;Wow, you just put two little bits into your identity, but you really don‚Äôt need to, because ‚Äì like I think you‚Äôre actually much more than that because you can solve problems extremely well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rallying cry is like, people who were able to make the things that they really want with what they‚Äôve got, like that‚Äôs sort of at the core of it, and I love that.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> I think that‚Äôs a beautiful definition, and more to your point, like I think some craftspeople really do associate themselves more with their tools than with the process, and it‚Äôs okay, but it‚Äôs like a narrowing thing. Like it actually happens in woodworking right now.</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> Does it?</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, like I‚Äôm a woodworker, and so ‚Äì like there‚Äôs some woodworkers who are like, &ldquo;Oh, it‚Äôs not really woodworking unless you are doing it all with hand tools,&rdquo; and you know, there are some woodworkers who are like, &ldquo;Oh, no, no, it‚Äôs only woodworking if you do it with power tools, but CNC is completely unacceptable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, it‚Äôs all the same craft, like you‚Äôre just wielding your tools in different ways and the tools evolve, and so it‚Äôs very interesting, that mindset, I think.</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> It‚Äôs funny because ‚Äì I mean, there‚Äôs ‚Äì there‚Äôs clearly some common ground somewhere, but no one ought to be a hammer carpenter, like that‚Äôs too fine grained, so everyone agrees, but you shouldn‚Äôt narrow the focus too much, but like the degree by which people agree is something to be debated.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, and one of the things that I‚Äôve seen in some of the most creative and successful craftspeople across any of these disciplines is the agility that they have to adapt to new tools, to sort of say, &ldquo;Oh, this is new and interesting. I‚Äôm going to incorporate this into my craft because it helps me do the thing that I care about, better.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> Yeah, I think this one skill, like how quickly you can get value out of new tools and how quickly do you spot better and better tools would make a substantial improvement to things that you that are worth improving on. It‚Äôs like the unacknowledged meta skill of all the most successful people on planet Earth. And I think it‚Äôs ‚Äì it‚Äôs really that. Like it‚Äôs so ‚Äì it, it just ‚Äì once you look for it, it‚Äôs really stunning. Like it‚Äôs ‚Äì it‚Äôs, you really do not hear stories of extremely successful people who are absolutely set in their ways, and it‚Äôs ‚Äì it‚Äôs, it‚Äôs ‚Äì it‚Äôs a fascinating ‚Äì At least, okay, you can probably find some people in some areas, but like, very unlikely to find this in ‚Äì in anywhere close to where you make things.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, so I want to go back to this thing that you mentioned a few minutes ago, which is this idea of apprenticeship, which I think is very, very powerful, and so my experience with this, as a programmer, was I always did my academic work and my programming work side by side, but they were relatively separate from one another.</p>
<p>So like, I would have a side job where I was, you know, writing firmware for industrial controllers, or I was helping someone build an internet site. Like this is all back in the early ‚Äò90s, and then I would go study computer science at school. And like it was always confusing to me that they were as separate as they were.</p>
<p>And I even remember, when I left my PhD studies to go join Google, I probably got more benefit, in terms of developing my craft as a programmer, that first six months at Google than anything else I did the rest of my programming life, and I, it really was an apprenticeship. So like it was the special thing about the culture at the time is that your peer engineers valued spending their time in code reviews, and like writing good documentation for the things that they were producing for building things in a way, like a first-order bit of their job was making a thing that someone else could reuse.</p>
<p>Like they were all, like teaching me how to be a better engineer, and I wonder how you think about that at Shopify, because ‚Äì like you, you sort of run your company as someone with programmer mindset, which I find very fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> Yeah, I mean, the concept of ‚Äì I have tried to reproduce the concept of apprenticeship because I love it as well, although it requires sort of a double opt in, which is hard to manufacture, I‚Äôve found. We had limited success with this, but we did have some, but it ‚Äì there is a bit of a cultural norm.</p>
<p>I mean, the first thing about ‚Äì vocational system in Germany, that‚Äôs really hard to replace. It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs extremely parent compatible, right? Like parents are like, you know, &ldquo;Godspeed. Go, go, go into the crafts, make ‚Äì do your honest work,&rdquo; and after apprenticeship also, you can go back to university afterwards. Like it‚Äôs optional which track you take. You can do academic ‚Äì next couple of years, or you do a vocational one.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, so ‚Äì so it‚Äôs ‚Äì it‚Äôs respected.</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> It‚Äôs respected, and that‚Äôs a really, really important thing because I ‚Äì I‚Äôm ‚Äì it‚Äôs, it was obviously easier to convince, you know, students to say, &ldquo;Hey, you should actually go full-time,&rdquo; just like you did with Google, because you kind of like ‚Äì like this is your ‚Äì but the parents would say, &ldquo;No chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I‚Äôve had dinners with parents trying to explain how this all can work out, and it‚Äôs just like very little pickup. So that‚Äôs sort of an interesting aspect. But the other thing is also the mindset of the ‚Äì of the apprentice. Like you are ‚Äì like they don‚Äôt even call you an apprentice, at least at my place. They didn‚Äôt call you apprentice. For first year, you were ‚Äì they called pen‚Äô ‚Äì like <em>Stift</em>, which is just short for pencil.</p>
<p>And like basically you were, utility, to be, like utilized for certain tasks, and like I cooked ‚Äì made coffee for everyone. I did the photocopying. I helped out in accounting. I actually did inventory sorting ‚Äì</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> That‚Äôs so important.</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> And now, like ‚Äì and now we are building warehouses, and I can draw on like weird lessons that I‚Äôve had doing something which ‚Äì some people describe as a hazing, but like it was actually ‚Äì it was very good, it was ‚Äì it was a perfect place to enter the workforce because you it just, I don‚Äôt even know what it does. Like humility in a way, but also just like perspective is fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Well, I ‚Äì look, I think, honestly, it‚Äôs a really good entrepreneurial lesson because when you ‚Äì when you are undertaking a new endeavor, like all that stuff needs to get done. Like the coffee needs to be made, the dishes need to be washed, the inventory needs to be ‚Äì I mean, like all of these, and like you have to ‚Äì I think as an entrepreneur, like part of your job is figuring out how are you going to be of service to your team and of service to the tasks that you are doing? And not being overly precious about what your role in that is, like just having flexibility, like, &ldquo;I will do whatever needs to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> I couldn‚Äôt agree more. You, you really have to I mean, at the very least, you should have a non-theoretical understanding of every little job that exists because otherwise how do you ‚Äì how can you judge what great work is, right? Like it‚Äôs, this is a very important part of what entrepreneurs have to do in a business, and you judge your own work because you‚Äôre doing every job in the beginning, and then you use that skill to actually help other people like reach higher than they might have otherwise imagined they would.</p>
<p>So those principles are super valuable, and just there‚Äôs very enduring truths, right? Like this is, you can find ‚Äì like, Cicero talked about Roman times, about the importance of having hands-on experience at everything.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm, I‚Äôm not sure if he would go all the way down to ‚Äì in that particular society, with those things, and ‚Äì but the virtues of these ideas are well known to us, and so ‚Äì in Shopify, so you are right. I operate under the fundamental assumption that all companies are terrible, that ‚Äì all of the ones ever created, which you know, like I ‚Äì I, some people don‚Äôt love me saying this, but like I ‚Äì I think, to me, this is actually inspiring because, boy, building companies is worth it.</p>
<p>Like, it‚Äôs like, I mean, all innovation around us is like ‚Äì it comes from companies. It comes from journeys, it comes from ‚Äì like entrepreneurships and builders getting together. You build this incredible legal structure which allows deeply caring, hardworking people to get together, align everyone‚Äôs economic incentives, and allow them to just like pour themselves into, like really tough problems for ‚Äì you know, sometimes their entire work life, and I think it‚Äôs a beautiful thing that we have something like this. And so we should be good at it.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, and I tend to agree with you. All of what you just said is the inspiring bit, and like I don‚Äôt know that there‚Äôs an existence proof for how to go accomplish the most complicated things that humans get up to, without this sort of structure. Like maybe there‚Äôs something else, but like, I think the only other thing might be like a national emergency, like you‚Äôre going to war, or something like that.</p>
<p>But like companies I think do a pretty good job of doing what you said, like sort of aligning the interests of a whole bunch of people to accomplish a task that‚Äôs, you know, too big for any one of them, individually, to accomplish. And like, that‚Äôs sort of a necessity, right, because companies are kind of miserable, right? It, it‚Äôs just sort of hard, hard work to get a group of people together to do these complicated things, and there‚Äôs so many, like entropic pulls, to ‚Äì you know, misery and inefficiency and friction and so like that‚Äôs ‚Äì I‚Äôd love to hear your take on like how you think about solving some of these problems at Shopify, but like it just is a constant struggle against all of these things to, like make a company work well.</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> Yeah, so I would be really sad if people tell ‚Äì if someone would come to me in the future and say, &ldquo;Hey, like the companies of today are the most efficient companies ever will exist, and there‚Äôs not much to be improved.&rdquo; I would probably be uninterested in doing my job if that would be the case.</p>
<p>So again, if something is terrible, it‚Äôs very motivating to me because, like I draw motivation from dissatisfaction with the status quo, usually. That‚Äôs my sort of source of energy, and so if you would take any ‚Äì I mean, the World Cup, the World Soccer Cup is going on right now, and you always see these like replays ‚Äì like replays of the goals, and sometimes an analysis, and like it‚Äôs just like, every single player is just in the right spot, right?</p>
<p>Like it‚Äôs ‚Äì this is like the top of the game, where it matters more ‚Äì like people who have spent their entire lives, like training for this moment, but like there‚Äôs lots of mistakes. Like, it‚Äôs like if you actually get down to it, like individual muscles that were activated, you‚Äôre probably like talking about like 70% efficiency, or something like this. Like, we are getting close, like as close as we can.</p>
<p>But if you freeze-frame every frame, and analyze, like is everyone exactly where they should be or are there different opportunities they didn‚Äôt spot within the moment, you will find them. If you do that with a company, what‚Äôs the ‚Äì if they, if a professional player gets to 70%, companies probably get to seven, right? Like there are so many memos that no one reads, so many meetings that should be an email, and so many projects that, you know, are like local maxima optimizations of something that no one would have to do, if everyone would just spend a moment figuring out what does a global company want from its mission, right?</p>
<p>Like, so I certainly have not cracked the code on how to solve these problems, but I mean, again, what‚Äôs motivating to me is like at the end of my career I want to have conversations with my contemporaries and say I want to know that I‚Äôve done the best job I could have possibly done, and maybe I‚Äôm going to be slightly less embarrassed, by my company, so that would be awesome.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, it‚Äôs really ‚Äì I mean, it‚Äôs interesting to hear you frame it this way because when we were building LinkedIn, for instance, like we thought about it a lot in these terms. There‚Äôs this economist-philosopher named Frank Kaufmann, who ‚Äì one of the exercises he does is ‚Äì you know, to a group of leaders, he walks into the room, and he asks folks on a football team, &ldquo;What‚Äôs the job of the goalkeeper?&rdquo; And people will confidently raise their hand and say it‚Äôs to ‚Äì you know, play that position and keep the ball out of the goal, and he‚Äôs like, &ldquo;No, you‚Äôre wrong,&rdquo; like their job is to help the team win the game, and like that ‚Äì that mentality, I think, in the best football teams is probably why they get to 70% efficiency.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not just about being at peak performance for themselves, but like paying attention to, like everything else that‚Äôs happening on the field, with their opponents and their teammates and being willing to get into whatever position you need to be in to assist your team in winning the game. And that‚Äôs just sort of ‚Äì it gets harder, the bigger you get, you know, probably quadratically, at least, and you know, you‚Äôre just sort of fighting against a bunch of impulses, right?</p>
<p>Like, one of the catastrophic failings of sports teams is, like, if you get an egomaniac on the team who, like, wants the whole game to be about them. And, like, you sort of see those pathologies inbig companies.</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> Absolutely. Yeah, I mean, with business is like, people have, like, a different incentive hierarchy than the team. And ‚Äì and, you know, that‚Äôs a book, which made a really big impression on me. I read it, like, sort of, like, very early, and then recently, again, written by James Carse, which is it‚Äôs named <em>Finite and Infinite Games</em>. And it‚Äôs actually ‚Äì it‚Äôs a pretty dense, philosophical book. But it feels extremely actionable, because it really explains how, you know, the ‚Äì you know, some things are, I mean‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Like, the world is, like, completely controlled by finite games, partly because they have clear goals, and they are measurable, and they‚Äôre fun, and they‚Äôre easy to communicate, and they are‚Ä¶ you just know how you do. Like, there‚Äôs a score, and you know if you‚Äôre winning, but there are infinite games as well.</p>
<p>So, like, for instance, like, every person on planet Earth is, I think, I hope, engaged in an infinite game towards wisdom, towards, like, education. Like, these are unwinnable games. They have no goal orientation, and there‚Äôs no way to finish them, right? Like, those could go on forever. But we‚Äôve structured the world in such a way that we encode these infinite pursuits underneath finite games, like school, like Grade 1, Grade 2. Like, you can win Grade 1 by qualifying for Grade 2, and you can win the math test by getting a high score.</p>
<p>One thing which is unfortunate, I think, which happens at some point is that people end up getting so addicted sort of in this sort of empty calories, dopamine way to how they‚Äôre doing on the finite games and the scores, that they completely lose their pursuit of more important infinite goals. And I think that‚Äôs a problem that‚Äôs avoidable. It‚Äôs a cultural thing.</p>
<p>And, again, I could talk about how this informs some of the things we‚Äôre doing at Shopify, but, like, I don‚Äôt actually know how to get the most value out of these ideas, per se. I just know that eventually, we will figure out how to turn what I just said into the perfect fortune cookie. And once it is compressed this way in such a way that it ‚Äúlosslessly‚Äù uncompresses into the right set of ideas, after it‚Äôs communicated, whoever figures that one out will do better than everyone else. And then hopefully, in the sort of Darwinian process of ideas, it‚Äôll be something that becomes better known and better communicated.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, it really is a tough set of problems, because‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs tough on a bunch of different images. Like, one of them, for instance, is in a complicated company ‚Äì and I‚Äôm sure Shopify is at the point where it‚Äôs a complicated company ‚Äì you have people like you who probably have, like, this very wide horizontal view of what‚Äôs going on that not many other people have. And then you have people who have these, like, very narrow vertical views of some part of the company. And both of those things are sort of necessary, and they both occupy a huge amount of space in your head.</p>
<p>And so, it‚Äôs just sort of hard. I mean, like, it would be impossible for you, for instance, to, like, have the sum of all of those little detail vertical bits of knowledge in your head at one time. And it would probably be very hard for someone who‚Äôs, like, deep in the weeds of, you know, like, hey, I‚Äôve got to solve this particular problem in this backend code to get the latency down. And there‚Äôs some weird bug, you know, whatever it might be, to have time to, like, see the whole horizontal view.</p>
<p>And so, like, you know, part of the hell of setting up a company is, like, how do you ‚Äì you know, how do you balance those two things out? Like, how do you free the people who need to go do this detailed stuff to have enough context about what‚Äôs going on? And so, when they‚Äôre making their decisions every day, they choose to spend their time on the right things.</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> Totally. I mean, this is the hardest challenge related to alignment. It‚Äôs the alignment challenge of companies.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> We‚Äôre hearing a lot about alignment challenges in ‚Äì in AI, and I feel, like, we should solve the people ones first. It‚Äôs ‚Äì I would love to have an RLHF for my HR, my company.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, and you might one day. (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> Yeah, I might one day. So, this is actually‚Ä¶ look, your listeners are, like, this is a lot of highly technical people. A lot of them are in key roles in the businesses they are in.</p>
<p>I think, a thing we talked about earlier, which is sort of academia sort of decided it‚Äôs computer science. And therefore, it‚Äôs going to STEM. And it‚Äôs sort of, like, that‚Äôs its swim lane. It‚Äôs ‚Äì we‚Äôre still a little bit, like, there‚Äôs a hangover from that idea, which means that I don‚Äôt think the technical ‚Äì the sort of technically minded people, especially the ones who make it high up in an organization structure tend to be people who can reason very well across very complicated systems, because that‚Äôs what we built, right? Like, you know, the architects and the people will find the novel solutions, which means that‚Ä¶</p>
<p>There‚Äôs a ‚Äì there‚Äôs a wonderful story. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a true story. Sorry for the aside. That I read‚Ä¶ Man, yeah, let me go back. And if I don‚Äôt get this, right, don‚Äôt ‚Äì this was a long time ago, that I heard about this, where I think Charles Petzold from Microsoft actually talked about it, who writes amazing books ‚Äì shout out ‚Äì which I read, and now read to my children.</p>
<p>Anyway, he retold the story. There was an event of where I think Bill Gates was introducing Basic, and there was a programming contest, like, Storm The Gates, I think was it called. This is, like, weird memories coming back to me. And you were supposed to, like, write code, which was, like, quicker than Bill using Basic, presumably in Pascal or Sembla or something like this.</p>
<p>And some ‚Äì someone ended up winning by realizing that the spec was draw a circle on the screen at different alternating differences of circumference, and realized you could do this with an uppercase and lowercase O ‚Äì (laughter) ‚Äì so, which, of course, like, somehow, somewhere in this story, again, is this incredible pragmatic-ness of, like, being able to spot, like, the sort of Pareto Principle. Here‚Äôs how we can solve this issue without having to do all the hard work. Like, we don‚Äôt actually have to build an entire GUI stack. We can actually just solve the spec this way.</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry for the aside. Like, the people who are high up in companies are trained on systems thinking and don‚Äôt know it, because this is what we do in engineering. Engineering is an applied field of systems thinking in the same way how poker is an applied field of game theory. And this actually took a while in my own journey after, you know, running a company which was getting increasingly big. I tried to, very hard, to check my biases of, like, hey, engineering would solve this this way. But of course, you are a professional in HR. Therefore, you understand how this really works.</p>
<p>And, you know, often this is true, but sometimes, like, our industry has solved problems that are not fathomable by people who are in other fields, in other disciplines. And so, I really highly encourage people to take more of an engineering, like a systems engineering, a company engineering approach to their businesses.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, everyone who works in a company is an intelligent actor working in accordance with their incentive system. A lot of it is sort of entropy reversion to the mean that happens in companies. You know, people talk about it as politics, people talk about it as bureaucracy, people talk about it as process. These are all proxy words for ‚Äúthis sucks.‚Äù</p>
<p>A lot of this just happens because people want to improve the place. They identify true problems, but they don‚Äôt have the ability to create processes or systems, one set of systems that actually are effortless. But computers are very good at it. A lot of other problems arise if the people who can create the processes are the actors in the systems, because incentives aren‚Äôt aligned there.</p>
<p>So, one ‚Äì you know, at some point, I realized Shopify was getting really inefficient in, like, all these random ways. Like, there‚Äôs like, I don‚Äôt know, on 5,000 or 10,000, people of staff, we had like ‚Äì like 5,000 different titles, partly because I realized at some point, my God, like, this company‚Äôs people systems are basically like, I don‚Äôt know, like a Windows 95 computer connected to the modern Internet, unpatched, giving everyone root access. And like, if that‚Äôs your situation, then you probably are going to end up with really random, hard‚Äìto‚Äìdocument, like, incentive systems in the company. And you will never spot who is acting according to which.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, like, I don‚Äôt know, these days, all our people systems, titling, comm frameworks, levels, disciplines, and sub disciplines, and all these kinds of things exist in a GitHub repository, that you have to formulate a pull request against if you want to make a change. And then there‚Äôs going to be a discussion and unless it is committed, this is not happening.</p>
<p>And that‚Äôs not actually that crazy of a change, although it‚Äôs a little bit of a hard tool to initially explain to the HR team. But once you‚Äôre there, everyone loves it because now, you know, that ‚Äì something that was previously kind of crazy, suddenly is totally‚Ä¶ like, there‚Äôs a shared understanding of how the system evolves forward.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah. I ‚Äì so, I love that example. I think you and I were chatting about that at some event a few months ago. And I was like, this is ‚Äì it‚Äôs like, really, really inventive and creative, because part of the struggle that you deal with in these complicated organizations, where you‚Äôve got a lot of different people with a lot of different information is just sort of sharing context.</p>
<p>Like, how did this decision get made? What is the real problem that we‚Äôre trying to solve? Like, what have we tried before that didn‚Äôt work? And, like, what did we try before that did work? And, like, what can we all learn from these? So, like, having a way to, like, codify these decisions, like, where you‚Äôve got the whole pull request history and, I mean, I think it‚Äôs really smart.</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> And it‚Äôs extremely powerful. Like, we‚Äôve been doing, like, I&rsquo;ve been working on this one a while, and I actually, you know, write code along on this repository, which is doing this kind of thing. And they‚Äôre using, like, tools, which are, again, made by engineers for engineering problems, but actually generalized to people system cases in ways that I think isn‚Äôt clear to people.</p>
<p>So, for instance, you‚Äôll like this because this is your thing. Probably the most sort of politics‚Äìinducing process that I‚Äôve ever encountered in my company is headcount allocation.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah. (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> Because it‚Äôs ‚Äì you know, it‚Äôs very many ‚Äì like, a lot of things aren‚Äôt zero sum games, and people just pretend they are. But some things are, you know, resources are finite, and ‚Äì and it‚Äôs a rivalrous process, right? Like, and headcount allocation is clearly one of those.</p>
<p>So, we now in the same GitHub repository, we have a full, like stated via DSL. The principles by which Shopify does headcount, the decisions that are high level on, like, which groups should be which size. And then we run it through, I think it‚Äôs called Z3. It‚Äôs a SAT solver, like an optimized version of a SAT solver, which comes out of Microsoft Research.</p>
<p>And I read the entire doc on it. It talks about every single problem that you could imagine, except not headcount allocation. (Laughter.) So, it‚Äôs ‚Äì certainly an off‚Äìlabel use, but, like, it‚Äôs magical. Like, it‚Äôs a magical tool applied in this space.</p>
<p>And it‚Äôs an incredibly complex problem, and it solves ‚Äì like, suddenly, people don‚Äôt have to go fight. People just ‚Äì I mean, people will make their cases on the principal level, and then we make decisions, which are committed. And then on CI, the thing reruns, and it generates data and a book. (Laughter.) And, like, everyone can read how many people they get. So, it‚Äôs really neat, if you can get there.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, I ‚Äì I think, again, that‚Äôs super smart. Like, this is one of the very interesting things I think about, being in an organization and making decisions. Like, frequently, like, all of this stuff, that sort of politics and emotion and whatnot, goes away as soon as everybody understands what the rubric is for making the decision. And they believe that it‚Äôs fair, that the decision maker or the decision making process, like in the case, this SAT solver that you‚Äôre using, like, has seen all of the relevant data, when it is producing the solution, the decision. So, I think it‚Äôs clever.</p>
<p>The one thing that I will add, though, I agree with you that headcount allocation is mostly a zero sum problem. But there are ways to, like, make it slightly non zero in that I find, oftentimes, people haven‚Äôt really asked themselves, when they want another person on their team, like, why do I want another person? Have I exploited every other possible way to, like, get the work done that I think this new person is necessary for?</p>
<p>And, you know, sometimes, there‚Äôs, like, a bunch of shadow reasons for adding people. It‚Äôs like, oh, well, it‚Äôs a score that I‚Äôm keeping, you know, on, you know, how influential I am as a manager, or, like, I need to collect these many people tokens before I can advance to the next level. You know, and I‚Äôm ‚Äì like, I‚Äôm not even making fun of it. Like, I‚Äôm sure I have done this myself in the past.</p>
<p>But oftentimes, when people really look at what they need to do, like, there‚Äôs other ways to accomplish the problem than adding another head. And, like, adding another head to a team, like, just bigger is always worse, honestly. So, you don‚Äôt want to be big, unless it‚Äôs absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Have you built the tools that you need to do to make yourself more efficient? Like, have you, like, tried to go in and clean up a bunch of friction that you have in the system? Like, for the love of God, don‚Äôt add more people just to cover up, you know, for inefficiencies that you‚Äôve let creep into the system.</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> It‚Äôs also bad for the planet, right? Like, if people do this, because, like, I mean, every problem that can be solved by one person should be solved by one person, because there‚Äôs nothing more efficient. Like, you know, I type 120 words per minute. That‚Äôs not even, like, the speed of a modem from the ‚Äò90s. And ‚Äì but our brain interconnects with, like, some multi‚Äìterabytes of synaptic bandwidth.</p>
<p>So, if you encounter a problem that can be solved by a single person, the speed of communication internally to the brain to, like, having ‚Äì to even just one other person is just, like, magnitudes different. This is why you have ultra‚Äìefficient people, if people have a range to solve all aspects of a problem. Now, of course, this is sort of‚Ä¶ you know, sometimes it‚Äôs getting rarer, that that happens, although hopefully, we‚Äôll stage a comeback.</p>
<p>Now if you add people just because, hey, we need at least three people so that, you know, if anyone goes on vacation kind of thing, then‚Ä¶ and the problem could have been solved by one person, now there‚Äôs two people who are there to slow down one person, really, instead of, like, being an individual doing something really remarkable, the best they‚Äôve got, again. And it‚Äôs just kind of not ‚Äì no one benefits from this other than, like, I don‚Äôt know, like, it looks good in a spreadsheet, I guess. So, I think those are real conversations.</p>
<p>I cut my teeth ‚Äì like, so after ‚Äì after learning programming, working at this apprenticeship, one of the coolest things about growing up in Germany and ‚Äì and in the 90s was this ‚Äì what was previously referred to as the demo scene, which is really the, this was really pre‚ÄìInternet. It was super expensive to go on Internet, so we really ‚Äì we had mailboxes that we downloaded, BBSs. So, but we would have a lot of these LAN parties where, like, on a weekend, 1,000, 500 people would bring their computers. And then it was almost a festival where code was celebrated like a craft.</p>
<p>So, there was competitions you could enter at, like, four kilobytes, 64 kilobyte and two megabytes, and you just were making art, right? Like, we‚Äôre making something that was launched, shown and rated by everyone.</p>
<p>And this is where I learned to really program and, you know, we did all this in Assembler. And we were engaged in a four kilobyte category, which is like the .exe header, the PE header is too large.</p>
<p>Like, you were making comm files. And you‚Äôre like, you‚Äôre are not importing anything there. So, it was absolutely incredible, like, just procedurally generating textures, and landscapes and so on, like, programming for the art of it.</p>
<p>And so, you know, like, I mean, we‚Äôre recording this in 20‚Ä¶ right at the end of 2022, very different world than it was 12 months ago. I sort of talked about the 2021 energy as sort of the tail end of the boom times. And now, there‚Äôs like a 2022 energy around us, which I think, whatever else it does, it really compels people to think more about what to do with limited resources, right?</p>
<p>And actually, this is so much better. Like, it‚Äôs not engineering, if you have infinite resources. That is called daydreaming. (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> It doesn‚Äôt qualify as engineering if you think, oh, we could refactor this to be so perfect, if you had unlimited time. And, you know, like, yeah, that ‚Äì that‚Äôs hallucination. That‚Äôs not actually engineering. Engineering is getting the thing you want with what you‚Äôve got. And I think that‚Äôs actually a very good energy to seep into our industry again, because we lost this a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, I could not agree with you more, and I wish we had more time. We‚Äôre almost at the end. But, like, maybe very quickly, I could ask you&hellip; what outside ‚Äì and so, I know, like, being CEO of, like, one of the fastest growing, most important e-commerce companies on the planet is a lot of work. But like, what outside of work do you do for fun? Like, what‚Äôs energizing you right now?</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> Right now, I am playing <em>Dwarf Fortress</em>. (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Nice.</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> But like, I mean, I tinker a lot. I mean, I have three kids; I have three boys, 12, 10 and eight. I ‚Äì we‚Äôll be on Replit together and using Kahoot ‚Äì no, Kaboom, anyway, like, for making video games, which is really, really fun. And we fell in love with this open source fantasy console called TIC‚Äì80, which is, like, basically a computer like they were when I was a kid.</p>
<p>And so, these are fun things, but I tinker a lot. I love technology. I am as addicted as ‚Äì although sometimes annoyed as everyone else ‚Äì to Hacker News as I ever have been. I have a home lab at home that‚Äôs now has increasingly getting GPUs, because I‚Äôm doing more machine learning. It‚Äôs ‚Äì it‚Äôs all built on Nix, because that seemed interesting to learn.</p>
<p>And, in fact, I learned from Nix how to build deterministic, reproducible environments and the value of them. And that actually influenced the HR system we built, which is like, think about that for a moment.</p>
<p>I think there‚Äôs ‚Äì like, I think there‚Äôs a school of thought about what creativity is, which says that creativity is predominantly the extraction of incredibly insightful ideas out of obscure fields and moving them into others where they are of just as much value, once contextualized. And I believe that. I really think that I find tons and tons of inspirations in this ‚Äì like, in this tinkering.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm doing the advent of code right now. I‚Äôm trying to do it in a different programming language every day of this year.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> What‚Äôs your favorite programming language right now?</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> I mean, I ‚Äì like, Ruby fits into my brain better than anything else. And I just love ‚Äì man, I could spend an hour talking about this, but, like, I wish people would give Ruby more of a chance because there‚Äôs ideas encoded in it, which are necessary in the rest of the programming world.</p>
<p>Like, making a programming language optimized for programmer happiness is just, like, important. Like, we are not machines, we‚Äôre humans. And we love aesthetics and these kinds of things, even though it just seems inefficient sometimes to the sort of more shape rotator types.</p>
<p>I really enjoy Zig right now. It just also seems like, I love everything that is a clear, novel take on problems that I recognize to be worth solving, right? Like, I ‚Äì doing this comp time thing is brilliant. Struggling a little bit with Rust.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs just like, the learning curve, it‚Äôs hard. I know I‚Äôm going to love it once I clear the borrow checker hurdle, but, like, I keep running my head into it. And yeah, actually, TypeScript is very, very good. TypeScript, I like, too, so.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Awesome. Well, I ‚Äì</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> What about you? What is ‚Äì what‚Äôs your favorite programming language? Like, can I ask this?</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> This is probably politically charged for you. (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> No, no, no, it‚Äôs not politically charged at all. So, I ‚Äì my default ‚Äì</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> I love all my children.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah. No, my default programming language for just a really long time now, since I was an engineer at Google, has been Python. Yeah, it‚Äôs very comfortable, like, the way that I think is harmonized with the with the language. And I‚Äôm sure, you know, sort of influenced in both directions. But yeah, and I‚Äôm intrigued by Rust. Like, it‚Äôs an interesting ‚Äì interesting learning curve. I‚Ä¶</p>
<p>You know, I‚Äôve been doing a bunch of, like, weird machining stuff, like, which we‚Äôve talked about before. And so, like, there‚Äôs a bunch of procedural stuff that I‚Äôm doing with, with machining, where I‚Äôm sort of taking a tool where you are graphically laying in a bunch of tool paths for a thing that you‚Äôre trying to make. And then I will export the code from that, which is usually G code, or, like, there‚Äôs this programming language called Simple for the DATRON CNC machine that I have. And then I‚Äôm writing a bunch of code to transform that in a bunch of weird ways to get the machining effects that I want.</p>
<p>And, like, what I really want is to be able to have a coding assistant, like, an AI assistant help me with all of this stuff, because I think there‚Äôs no reason to think that you can‚Äôt, in natural language, describe most of what it is I‚Äôm doing and have an assistant help you out with it.</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> Yeah, it‚Äôs ‚Äì I mean, I am so ready ‚Äì I started doing a lot more programming again, like, two, three years ago, because I just kind of ‚Äì I was really missing it.</p>
<p>And luckily, friends at GitHub hooked me up with, like, early access to GitHub Copilot. And I am just like ‚Äì I mean, I used to do all of Shopify‚Äôs programming, doing pair programming with my ‚Äì with one of my co‚Äìfounders. And we would play, like, a test driven development. And we would ‚Äì we would basically do this bug ping pong kind of thing, where we were trying to be lazy, as lazy as possible to solve for unit tests that the other person wrote, and go back and forth.</p>
<p>And like, but this is really fun for me, this kind of thing, but it‚Äôs hard to reproduce. Like, everyone‚Äôs scared of me now. Like, now, I can‚Äôt just go pair with someone random.</p>
<p>Honestly, working with Copilot is actually very close to this. Like, it really reminds me of, like, of pair programming with someone who‚Äôs always available. And it‚Äôs just like, again, it‚Äôs such a cool time to be in this space and be able to get to solve problems, and tinker with technology. It‚Äôs ‚Äì it‚Äôll be seen as the golden age forever, basically, from this point forward.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah. That, I very much agree with you. And so, on that note, thank you so much for being on the podcast today. And I could easily spend another couple hours chatting with you. So, hopefully, we‚Äôll get a chance to chat again.</p>
<p><strong>TOBI L√úTKE:</strong> Awesome. Yeah, really enjoyed this, too. Thanks so much for having me, Kevin.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Cool.</p>
<p>[MUSIC]</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> What a great conversation with Tobi L√ºtke. You know, as you mentioned, kind of at the top, he is such a pure engineer, through and through. And that was actually something that kind of struck me, as the two of you were talking, is he is obviously very entrepreneurial minded, and is a very good leader and thinks very thoughtfully about business. But he also approaches the way that he runs his business as an engineer in every aspect of everything that he does. It‚Äôs like he can‚Äôt turn it off. I love it.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah. And you can sort of see it. I mean, he and I, even before this interview, had talked about him applying some of these computer science and programming techniques to unusual places in the company, like how you do some HR things, like allocating headcount to teams, and, you know, like, how you document how you‚Äôre making the important decisions that you make in the company.</p>
<p>And so, like, I just love that mindset in general. And at the core, I think he talked about it a couple of different ways. Like, he really thinks of himself more as a craftsperson than, like, a scientist, or even like a business executive, I would imagine, where he‚Äôs always thinking about, like, what can I make from what I have?</p>
<p>And what he has is an important problem and a really amazing team. And he‚Äôs just constantly trying to think about, like, what tools can I use to mold the material of this company, this organization, this ecosystem into something that is not just satisfying the needs of the customer but is well built.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> Yes. No, I completely agree, and especially, it‚Äôs in an area that it needs to be well built, especially for what Shopify does. What kind of struck me, as you were even saying that, is that, you know, you‚Äôre right, he takes this craftsmanship approach. And I think he sees himself that way. But it also kind of comes through with the product itself, right? You talk about how they‚Äôre building this platform.</p>
<p>But fundamentally, Shopify is a platform for people to be able to build their own businesses, and build their own things, and sell things they‚Äôve maybe crafted themselves, if that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing. So, it kind of, you know, serendipitous and almost comes full circle in that regard.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, for sure. And again, like, we could have spent several more hours talking about things, because I think Tobi is truly a systems thinker and, like, thinks about things from first principles, and, like, not in that sort of superficial way. Like, I think it‚Äôs, you know, become a little bit trendy in the past ‚Äì past year to say, ‚Äúoh, I‚Äôm a first principles thinker.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> But this is just deeply wired into the way that Tobi thinks about the world, and it results in him just getting to, like, really impressive outcomes, like non‚Äìobvious things, just because he‚Äôs willing to think about things differently. And I love that.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> No, I love that too. I‚Äôve had a number of friends over the years who work at Shopify, or some of them who have worked at Shopify, and to a person, they‚Äôve all really had great things to say about him. And I think that comes through because, you know, especially, you can see it in the product, and the employees definitely see it. And I think you‚Äôre right, I think it comes from taking that first principles approach and really thinking thoughtfully about the things that he‚Äôs doing.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, and, like, maybe my ‚Äì selfishly, my favorite part of the conversation was right there at the end where, like, we‚Äôre sort of, you know, trading, like, what‚Äôs our favorite technical thing right now.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Like, I always feel like I learned something, talking with Tobi.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> No, honestly, I said this to you off‚Äìmic, but I‚Äôll say it on the pod as well. I could listen to an entire hour of just that. And so, Tobi, if you ever want to do, like, a Behind The Tech behind the scenes episode, like bonus episode, like there‚Äôs maybe a Patreon out there for you guys, is all I‚Äôm saying. (Laughter.) Like, I would definitely listen to that. I‚Äôm just saying I would subscribe.</p>
<p>All right, that is all the time that we have for this episode. A huge thank you to Tobi L√ºtke for joining us. And if you have anything that you‚Äôd like to share with us, like what is your favorite programming language right now, please e‚Äìmail us anytime at <a class="link" href="mailto:BehindTheTech@microsoft.com" >BehindTheTech@microsoft.com</a>. And you can follow Behind The Tech on your favorite podcast platform, or you can check out our full video episodes on YouTube.</p>
<p>Thanks for tuning in.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> And next month, we‚Äôll be talking with entrepreneur and AI thought leader, Rana el Kaliouby. See you next time.</p>
