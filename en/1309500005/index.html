    <p>hi friends how are you today</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s me again I&rsquo;m here</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;re having a wonderful day so far</p>
<p>if you are new here</p>
<p>hi my name is Bailey Sarian and it&rsquo;s Monday</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s Murder Mystery and Makeup Monday</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my theme song</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know how we ended up with it</p>
<p>but we did and it&rsquo;s here every Monday</p>
<p>I sit down and I talk about a true crime story</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been heavy on my noggin</p>
<p>and I do my makeup at the same time</p>
<p>so I would suggest you hit that subscribe button</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re interested in true crime</p>
<p>and makeup because it&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>and this week</p>
<p>the story was recommended to me by one of you guys</p>
<p>um shout out to Kalin Shay</p>
<p>99 on Twitter</p>
<p>she sent this to me</p>
<p>and it was really interesting and really kind of gross</p>
<p>to be honest as well</p>
<p>so you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right up my alley</p>
<p>and I thought let&rsquo;s do it</p>
<p>so Barbara Daily</p>
<p>Barbara was born in Boston in 1922</p>
<p>I believe she was an only daughter</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t read anything about her having siblings</p>
<p>so forgive me if I am wrong there</p>
<p>but I believe she was the only child</p>
<p>when she was 11 years old in 1933</p>
<p>her father actually committed suicide</p>
<p>he locked himself in the garage</p>
<p>he committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning</p>
<p>from the exhaust</p>
<p>Barbara was the one that found him</p>
<p>which I couldn&rsquo;t even imagine how</p>
<p>how that affects a poor child</p>
<p>once he committed suicide</p>
<p>it was just her and her mother</p>
<p>and they just waited</p>
<p>for the life insurance payment to come through</p>
<p>now this was like</p>
<p>back in 1933</p>
<p>so I believe</p>
<p>um life insurance was different than</p>
<p>like you could actually get life insurance</p>
<p>if somebody committed suicide</p>
<p>now I think</p>
<p>if you commit suicide</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get life insurance</p>
<p>I could be wrong there</p>
<p>it might be a fixed amount or something</p>
<p>but which is so stupid</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s so yeah</p>
<p>they ended up collecting a good amount of money</p>
<p>when the life insurance came through once</p>
<p>barbara&rsquo;s mother collected the life insurance policy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when the 2 of them</p>
<p>Barbara and her mother</p>
<p>they moved to New York City</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when they took up a residence in the Delmonico</p>
<p>Hotel in New York</p>
<p>based off like</p>
<p>articles I was looking at</p>
<p>it seems like the Del Monaco hotel was a pretty um</p>
<p>like elite hotel</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s no longer there anymore</p>
<p>Trump actually purchased it in 2001 for</p>
<p>like a hundred</p>
<p>and $15,000,000</p>
<p>and turned it into the Trump Park Avenue</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m getting at is</p>
<p>they must have had</p>
<p>they must have got a good amount of money</p>
<p>in order to stay there</p>
<p>from my understanding</p>
<p>they were not wealthy</p>
<p>barber&rsquo;s family</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s kind of suspicious</p>
<p>like do you think the mom killed him</p>
<p>now the 2 of them are living in New York City</p>
<p>and Barbara is in her teenage years</p>
<p>like her early twenties</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s thrown into the middle of the city</p>
<p>and she becomes a prominent social light</p>
<p>what is a social light</p>
<p>a social light is somebody who</p>
<p>like is wealthy</p>
<p>and is always at different parties</p>
<p>and always invited to the latest and greatest</p>
<p>those restaurants</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t ever get into</p>
<p>a social light</p>
<p>will be there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just somebody who</p>
<p>like networks</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>social light</p>
<p>I will Google</p>
<p>so I googled</p>
<p>social light</p>
<p>and it says</p>
<p>a person who is well known in fashionable society</p>
<p>and is fond of social activities</p>
<p>and entertainment</p>
<p>which like that could be any of us</p>
<p>anyways Barbara becomes a prominent socialite</p>
<p>in New York City</p>
<p>when she was there</p>
<p>you see Barbara would be named one of New york&rsquo;s</p>
<p>10 most beautiful girls</p>
<p>and from that</p>
<p>she gained regular modeling contracts with vogue</p>
<p>and harper&rsquo;s Bazaar</p>
<p>her social status and beauty</p>
<p>constantly brought her</p>
<p>invitations to high society parties</p>
<p>allowing her to date various wealthy admirers</p>
<p>very high brown high class</p>
<p>she just like</p>
<p>networked her way to the top baby</p>
<p>in her real life</p>
<p>she was actually suffering</p>
<p>from a mental illness</p>
<p>her mother also suffered from schizophrenia</p>
<p>but her I couldn&rsquo;t really get that much</p>
<p>clarification</p>
<p>now this was a time when mental health was</p>
<p>not really even talked about</p>
<p>because if you were seeing a psychiatrist or anything</p>
<p>you were taken as somebody who&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>am I saying that this is true</p>
<p>no but this</p>
<p>was a time when everybody thought that</p>
<p>she was also seeing a private patient</p>
<p>psychiatrist</p>
<p>his name was Foster Kennedy</p>
<p>and but she</p>
<p>never mentioned it</p>
<p>she kept it a secret</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t tell anybody</p>
<p>because if anybody knew</p>
<p>she would lose everything</p>
<p>now Barbara actually got invited</p>
<p>to fly out to Hollywood</p>
<p>for a screen test</p>
<p>she really want to be an actress</p>
<p>she just want to be famous</p>
<p>hold on why am I doing</p>
<p>let me do liner off camera</p>
<p>why do I try</p>
<p>and do it on camera</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>so while out in Los Angeles</p>
<p>Barbara did not get cast in a movie</p>
<p>but she actually left</p>
<p>with a new friendship</p>
<p>and that was from an actress</p>
<p>or an aspiring actress</p>
<p>named Cornelia Bakeland</p>
<p>Barbara met Cornelia</p>
<p>and they really hit it off</p>
<p>and they became friends</p>
<p>and they started hanging out a lot</p>
<p>and then Cornelia</p>
<p>introduced Barbara</p>
<p>to her brother</p>
<p>named Brooks</p>
<p>now Brooks was actually working as a</p>
<p>trainee pilot</p>
<p>with the Royal Canadian Air Force</p>
<p>now at first</p>
<p>barber&rsquo;s like oh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s cute</p>
<p>but like you guys playing</p>
<p>now back then</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have Google</p>
<p>so they had to figure out shit</p>
<p>on their own</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>how exactly</p>
<p>Barbara figures this out</p>
<p>but I think</p>
<p>probably word of mouth</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming</p>
<p>but she finds out</p>
<p>that Brooks</p>
<p>this guy and Cornelia</p>
<p>come from a very</p>
<p>very wealthy family</p>
<p>I mean money</p>
<p>you and I will never know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s different types of rich</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>self made millionaire</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s rich rich</p>
<p>which is old money</p>
<p>usually like</p>
<p>the oil industry</p>
<p>or the railroad company</p>
<p>those people are like rich</p>
<p>rich anyway</p>
<p>she finds out that</p>
<p>this family</p>
<p>rich Brooks</p>
<p>this guy that she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>kind of interested</p>
<p>but not really</p>
<p>she finds out that</p>
<p>his grandfather</p>
<p>invented plastic</p>
<p>he invented it</p>
<p>he probably stole it</p>
<p>from someone</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s the one that</p>
<p>like you know</p>
<p>got that patent</p>
<p>and everything</p>
<p>there was no plastic</p>
<p>before this man</p>
<p>so the 2 of them</p>
<p>Brooks and Barbara</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re dating now</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re official</p>
<p>barbara&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>like oh my God</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the best thing ever</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like fuck yeah</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m set for life</p>
<p>bitch come on</p>
<p>ask me to marry you</p>
<p>so as time goes on</p>
<p>allegedly the relationship was pretty rocky</p>
<p>from the start</p>
<p>they seem to always be bickering</p>
<p>fighting you know</p>
<p>eventually I think</p>
<p>Brooks is the one</p>
<p>who was like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really done with this</p>
<p>I and I went out of this relationship</p>
<p>and then good ol</p>
<p>Barb was like</p>
<p>well guess what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pregnant</p>
<p>now she knew</p>
<p>that Brooks</p>
<p>was just trying to get out of the relationship now</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the kicker</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the kicker</p>
<p>Barbara wasn&rsquo;t pregnant</p>
<p>nene Barbara</p>
<p>just didn&rsquo;t want this man to leave</p>
<p>cause then she</p>
<p>would have to go back to work</p>
<p>but she didn&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>Brooks this</p>
<p>until after</p>
<p>they got married</p>
<p>they got married</p>
<p>right away you know</p>
<p>getting a pregnant</p>
<p>before marriage</p>
<p>is just frowned upon</p>
<p>you know those times</p>
<p>doing anything wrong</p>
<p>it was frowned upon</p>
<p>it was frowned upon to breathe</p>
<p>just everything</p>
<p>was frowned upon</p>
<p>so they quickly get married</p>
<p>in California</p>
<p>because barbara&rsquo;s pregnant</p>
<p>we have to get married</p>
<p>before anybody finds out</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;s pregnant</p>
<p>they get married</p>
<p>boom barbara&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>oh by the way</p>
<p>not pregnant</p>
<p>of course that</p>
<p>leads to a really big fight</p>
<p>Brooks is really</p>
<p>disappointed</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucked up</p>
<p>Barbara over here</p>
<p>is just so happy</p>
<p>because she sealed the deal</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s now Barbara</p>
<p>Bakeland and</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>that means money</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s now part of the family</p>
<p>Bakelite family</p>
<p>bakelite is</p>
<p>the plastic</p>
<p>company that</p>
<p>the family owned</p>
<p>so after the marriage</p>
<p>the couple had</p>
<p>set up a home</p>
<p>and luxury apartment</p>
<p>in the Upper East Side</p>
<p>of New York</p>
<p>and in this apartment</p>
<p>they held parties</p>
<p>all the time</p>
<p>they would invite</p>
<p>only the fancy</p>
<p>and well known</p>
<p>wealthy people</p>
<p>in the area</p>
<p>come on over</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have a party</p>
<p>an extravagant dinner</p>
<p>just to kind of</p>
<p>keep this socialite</p>
<p>thing going</p>
<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>Brooks stayed with her</p>
<p>after finding out</p>
<p>she lied about</p>
<p>being pregnant</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t really find</p>
<p>much information</p>
<p>maybe she lied to him</p>
<p>and said she lost the baby</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and maybe would have been</p>
<p>frowned upon it</p>
<p>now over time</p>
<p>Barbara in general</p>
<p>became well known to</p>
<p>to everybody</p>
<p>for her unstable</p>
<p>personality</p>
<p>she had rude</p>
<p>outburst not fun</p>
<p>to hang out with</p>
<p>she was just rude</p>
<p>she was very rude</p>
<p>to people but again</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a time</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t get help</p>
<p>and if anyone knew</p>
<p>she was seeing a</p>
<p>psychiatrist</p>
<p>it would be</p>
<p>it would be</p>
<p>done for her</p>
<p>social light days</p>
<p>so it was also</p>
<p>reported that</p>
<p>Barbara was</p>
<p>an alcoholic</p>
<p>she would get</p>
<p>sloppy drunk</p>
<p>it was also said</p>
<p>as time went on</p>
<p>her husband</p>
<p>Brooks he had</p>
<p>many affairs</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>like a new girl</p>
<p>a week he just</p>
<p>was constantly</p>
<p>sleeping around</p>
<p>whoopsie Barbara</p>
<p>actually did</p>
<p>end up pregnant</p>
<p>for reals this time</p>
<p>with Brooks baby</p>
<p>she ended up</p>
<p>giving birth to</p>
<p>a little boy</p>
<p>in August of 1946</p>
<p>and his name was</p>
<p>Anthony Bacon</p>
<p>they called him</p>
<p>Tony for short</p>
<p>so every summer</p>
<p>beginning in 1954</p>
<p>and then onward</p>
<p>the whole Bacon</p>
<p>family they</p>
<p>would pretty much do</p>
<p>what a lot of</p>
<p>rich people do</p>
<p>they have the luxury</p>
<p>of having a home</p>
<p>well many homes</p>
<p>so they had</p>
<p>their main home</p>
<p>like in New York</p>
<p>and then they had</p>
<p>another home</p>
<p>Spain London</p>
<p>Paris and then</p>
<p>it just really depended</p>
<p>on the season</p>
<p>where they wanted to stay</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s cold</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go stay</p>
<p>in our summer house</p>
<p>why pay for heating</p>
<p>when you can</p>
<p>just go somewhere</p>
<p>warm you know</p>
<p>am I right peasants</p>
<p>and then in 1960 the family decided</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just go live in Paris</p>
<p>something happened in New York</p>
<p>I think it was at a party</p>
<p>Barbara I guess had gotten really sloppy</p>
<p>sloppy drunk and just was a mess</p>
<p>like embarrassed herself</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why they decided to go stay in Paris</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t know about that little hiccup I had</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just go stay there and start over</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re in Paris</p>
<p>Brooks her husband</p>
<p>he had met another girl</p>
<p>English diplomats daughter</p>
<p>and she was 15 years old</p>
<p>at this time</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t illegal</p>
<p>15 sounds great</p>
<p>so he meets this girl she&rsquo;s 15</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like wow I love her</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s the love of my life</p>
<p>and Brooks is like I&rsquo;m gonna marry you</p>
<p>this is such a Lifetime movie</p>
<p>so Brooks goes to his wife Barbara</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like hey</p>
<p>met this 15 year old</p>
<p>I want to be with her</p>
<p>I want out of this marriage</p>
<p>here are the divorce papers</p>
<p>I want out now</p>
<p>like any of us would be</p>
<p>Barbara was traumatized</p>
<p>she was so upset</p>
<p>plus she was jealous and bitter</p>
<p>that he was going with a 15 year old</p>
<p>a much younger woman</p>
<p>lady kid much younger kid</p>
<p>and she was quote</p>
<p>better looking than her</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s when Barbara just lost it</p>
<p>okay she was like</p>
<p>my life is over</p>
<p>no more money</p>
<p>I love this man</p>
<p>so Barbara came up with this great idea</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like you know what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna kill myself</p>
<p>so she tries to kill herself</p>
<p>it was more for show</p>
<p>Brooks is like</p>
<p>really Barb</p>
<p>she tried to kill herself</p>
<p>but it didn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>because she didn&rsquo;t really want to die</p>
<p>she just wanted Brooks be scared</p>
<p>and like stay with her</p>
<p>Brooks comes home finds her</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ll break off the affair</p>
<p>I just wanna be with you Barb</p>
<p>so Barbara ends up being fine</p>
<p>and she gets what she wanted</p>
<p>Brooks is breaks off this affair with the 15 year old</p>
<p>and just wants to be with Barbara</p>
<p>as far as the relationship goes with their son</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really not talked about much</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t seem like</p>
<p>there was much of a relationship</p>
<p>there was nanny&rsquo;s taking care of Tony</p>
<p>Barbara just giving him whatever he wanted</p>
<p>because she didn&rsquo;t really want to be a mother</p>
<p>so she just gave him stuff</p>
<p>and that was good enough</p>
<p>poor Tony this little kid</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just growing up super wealthy</p>
<p>but he really doesn&rsquo;t have parents around</p>
<p>to take care of him</p>
<p>pretty much ignored the son</p>
<p>after the age of 18</p>
<p>he decides to kind of travel around</p>
<p>and live in different areas</p>
<p>than his family</p>
<p>like he wants to be on his own</p>
<p>plus they&rsquo;re wealthy</p>
<p>he can go wherever he wanted</p>
<p>and the parents didn&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>which is like the dream</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re a teenager</p>
<p>so Tony was like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna go through Europe to like</p>
<p>different places</p>
<p>and then kind of figure out where I&rsquo;m gonna live</p>
<p>so then in 1967</p>
<p>Tony is now 20 years old</p>
<p>he decides to go live in Italy</p>
<p>and at this time</p>
<p>Tony ends up meeting a guy named Jake Cooper</p>
<p>and Jake Cooper was a bisexual Australian man</p>
<p>now Jake would become a really close friend to Tony</p>
<p>Jake would be the one</p>
<p>to introduce Tony to various different drugs</p>
<p>tony&rsquo;s like oh shit</p>
<p>this is cool drugs</p>
<p>so Tony and Jake are getting pretty close</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pretty much living together</p>
<p>you know a little bit of time goes on</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re experimenting with drugs and stuff</p>
<p>and then tony&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m attracted to dudes</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna be with this guy so</p>
<p>they ended up being in a romantic relationship together</p>
<p>the 2 of them</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t tell anybody</p>
<p>because again</p>
<p>this was a time when no no no</p>
<p>Barbara was still living in Paris</p>
<p>while her son was having this relationship</p>
<p>down in Italy</p>
<p>word got back to Barbara</p>
<p>that her son was in a relationship with a man</p>
<p>and Barbara was like</p>
<p>oh hell no he is not</p>
<p>so Barbara was like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna drive down there</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna go get him</p>
<p>bring him back</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna fix this</p>
<p>he will not make this family look bad</p>
<p>so Barbara drives down there</p>
<p>to where her son staying at</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>get your shit</p>
<p>we are getting out of here right now</p>
<p>so Barbara actually</p>
<p>wanted to set her son up with a young girl</p>
<p>Barbara firmly believed that Tony just didn&rsquo;t meet</p>
<p>the right girl</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why he was gay</p>
<p>he needed a girl that he actually liked</p>
<p>and he wouldn&rsquo;t be gay anymore</p>
<p>so Barbara hit up one of her friends</p>
<p>her friend had a young Spanish daughter</p>
<p>and her name was Sylvie</p>
<p>and pretty much</p>
<p>Barbara was like</p>
<p>this is the girl</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna date</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re not dating a guy anymore</p>
<p>and this is who you&rsquo;re dating</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s moving in</p>
<p>so the relationship was moving</p>
<p>quite quickly</p>
<p>sylvie Barbara</p>
<p>Brooks Tony</p>
<p>they were all living together</p>
<p>barbara&rsquo;s plan actually backfired</p>
<p>and she found out that her husband</p>
<p>Brooks was sleeping</p>
<p>and had a relationship with Sylvie</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s messy</p>
<p>so then in 1968</p>
<p>Brooks decided that he was just</p>
<p>again once again</p>
<p>he was done with Barbara</p>
<p>and her shit</p>
<p>he wanted to be with the Sylvie girl</p>
<p>so Brooks goes to Barb</p>
<p>and tells her</p>
<p>once again like</p>
<p>I want out of this</p>
<p>I want to have this marriage</p>
<p>luckily for Brooks</p>
<p>I guess they ended up getting a divorce</p>
<p>and Brooks ended up marrying Sylvie</p>
<p>and Tony tells Barbara that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be with a guy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I want</p>
<p>I like men this time</p>
<p>I just really set her off the rails</p>
<p>like she was livid</p>
<p>okay look Barber was having a lot of affairs as well</p>
<p>throughout her marriage</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t just the Brooks guy</p>
<p>she was also</p>
<p>engaging in some affairs</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m mentioning that because</p>
<p>her thought process here really doesn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just different</p>
<p>so Barbara was determined to</p>
<p>fix her son</p>
<p>so she would hire prostitutes</p>
<p>force Tony to have sex with them</p>
<p>and like none of it was working</p>
<p>Barbara here was like</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had many men tell me</p>
<p>that my pussy is bomb</p>
<p>maybe if I sleep with Tony</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll be straight</p>
<p>hey her ego</p>
<p>is that big my vagina</p>
<p>is that special</p>
<p>that it will heal Tony</p>
<p>of his gayness</p>
<p>oh yes this is what</p>
<p>she thought</p>
<p>Barbara was alleged</p>
<p>to have manipulated her son</p>
<p>into having sex with her</p>
<p>which is absolutely disturbing</p>
<p>now her son</p>
<p>was really good looking</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if she was like</p>
<p>actually attracted to him or what</p>
<p>but at the end of the day</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s still your son</p>
<p>so that is and it said that</p>
<p>during his young adulthood</p>
<p>Tony displayed</p>
<p>signs of schizophrenia</p>
<p>with paranoid tendencies</p>
<p>and his erratic behavior</p>
<p>caused concern</p>
<p>and then eventually</p>
<p>he was diagnosed with schizophrenia</p>
<p>however his</p>
<p>his father refused to</p>
<p>allow him to be treated</p>
<p>by a psychiatrist</p>
<p>he believed that</p>
<p>it was immoral</p>
<p>it was against everything</p>
<p>they believe in</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna get help</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not schizophrenic</p>
<p>he just needs a nap</p>
<p>so when Barbara is having this relationship with him</p>
<p>having a sexual relationship with him</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s even worse</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s taking</p>
<p>advantage of her son</p>
<p>who is suffering from a mental illness</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going untreated</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>like making</p>
<p>everything worse</p>
<p>with her selfish actions</p>
<p>got tongue tied</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re having a</p>
<p>sexual relationship</p>
<p>for a little bit of time</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s even said that</p>
<p>Tony was seeing another guy</p>
<p>and they were like</p>
<p>at the house</p>
<p>and then Barbara had a</p>
<p>threesome with them</p>
<p>Barbara felt like</p>
<p>she thought</p>
<p>if I have sex</p>
<p>with my son</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not going</p>
<p>to be gay anymore</p>
<p>but she did that here</p>
<p>on October 17th 1972</p>
<p>Tony ended up murdering Barb</p>
<p>Tony goes down into the kitchen</p>
<p>and he grabs a kitchen knife</p>
<p>he went behind Barb</p>
<p>his mother and he ended up staring stabbing her</p>
<p>just a couple of times</p>
<p>because his first stab</p>
<p>almost killed her instantly</p>
<p>I think it was only like 2 times</p>
<p>but he stabs her</p>
<p>and Barbara ends up dying</p>
<p>she was 50 years old at that time</p>
<p>Tony at this time was 25</p>
<p>so you see this story was pretty old</p>
<p>and there wasn&rsquo;t that much information on it</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really clear on like I&rsquo;m not sure why</p>
<p>police came to the scene</p>
<p>who called I&rsquo;m not sure on that</p>
<p>but police do end up coming to the scene</p>
<p>and they end up finding Barbara</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s dead on the ground</p>
<p>and they also find Tony</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s still at the house</p>
<p>police arrest</p>
<p>and they take him in</p>
<p>and he confesses to the murder</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like yeah</p>
<p>I did that shit</p>
<p>he also goes on to say that Barbara was abusing him</p>
<p>and he just couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore</p>
<p>so he went up and he killed her he was gay</p>
<p>he also had mental health issues</p>
<p>that were going untreated</p>
<p>and it was because his mother</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t allowing him to be himself</p>
<p>but also was preventing him from getting more help</p>
<p>as far as the mental illness goes</p>
<p>and she was abusing him</p>
<p>so he just had all this rage built up</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna kill her</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sad but like</p>
<p>at the same time</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of like</p>
<p>well I don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the Gypsy Rose story</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s nothing like that</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of similar with Gypsy Rose</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t sexually abused</p>
<p>but she was being abused</p>
<p>and then she just had somebody else kill her mom</p>
<p>with this story</p>
<p>Barbara is abusing her son</p>
<p>he the only way he thought he could get out</p>
<p>was killing her</p>
<p>do I think it&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>no but I I guess I&rsquo;m sick</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t come for me</p>
<p>but I kind of understand</p>
<p>I guess like I Yeah</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to agree that yeah</p>
<p>it was the only option</p>
<p>but sometimes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like dude</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>anyways so he confesses to the murder</p>
<p>he gets charged with murder</p>
<p>but instead of going to prison</p>
<p>he was institutionalized at Broadmoor</p>
<p>which is a psychiatric hospital</p>
<p>and he was there until July 21st of 1980</p>
<p>he seems to be doing really well</p>
<p>and the doctors were like you know what</p>
<p>he seems like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing well</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gotten better</p>
<p>of this illness</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure again</p>
<p>what the thought process was</p>
<p>I read that a group of his friends</p>
<p>had a petition to get him out</p>
<p>said that he was being abused</p>
<p>and he shouldn&rsquo;t even be there</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s fine but then</p>
<p>I also read that</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t the case</p>
<p>so he did get out in 1980</p>
<p>and he was 33 years old at this time</p>
<p>and tony&rsquo;s like okay</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t go with my dad</p>
<p>because his dad</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t want anything to do with him</p>
<p>so Tony was like</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t go to my dad</p>
<p>decides to fly to New York City</p>
<p>to stay with his 87 year old maternal grandmother</p>
<p>so this was barbara&rsquo;s mother now</p>
<p>it seems that they also had a very toxic relationship</p>
<p>and it only took 6 days</p>
<p>after he was released</p>
<p>July 27th he attacked his grandmother</p>
<p>with the kitchen knife</p>
<p>and he ended up stabbing her 8 times</p>
<p>and he broke several bones</p>
<p>it seemed he was very upset towards his grandmother</p>
<p>for a couple of reasons</p>
<p>one she didn&rsquo;t believe him</p>
<p>that Barbara was sexually abusing him</p>
<p>and then also</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t approve of him being gay</p>
<p>so then he was arrested</p>
<p>by the New York City Police Department</p>
<p>he was charged with attempted murder</p>
<p>and sent to prison</p>
<p>after 8 months</p>
<p>of being imprisoned</p>
<p>he actually was expecting to be released on bail</p>
<p>at a court hearing</p>
<p>March 20 1981</p>
<p>however it didn&rsquo;t work out</p>
<p>because there was a delay</p>
<p>in the transfer of his medical records from the UK</p>
<p>so this made Tony extremely depressed</p>
<p>he went back to his cell</p>
<p>and then he ended up putting a plastic</p>
<p>bag over his head</p>
<p>and he killed himself</p>
<p>there are a lot of people who do not believe that</p>
<p>Tony killed himself</p>
<p>they believe that</p>
<p>he was murdered</p>
<p>but there really isn&rsquo;t any proof</p>
<p>to show that he was murdered</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not really sure</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure</p>
<p>what I think</p>
<p>either anyways</p>
<p>so that is the story about Barbara</p>
<p>and Tony Brooks</p>
<p>Bakeland I know</p>
<p>I was kind of all over the place</p>
<p>with the story</p>
<p>because again</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t much information</p>
<p>about a lot of things</p>
<p>there was actually a movie made</p>
<p>based off of this story</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>Savage Grace</p>
<p>and it stars like</p>
<p>Julianne Moore</p>
<p>I think it has</p>
<p>plays Barbara</p>
<p>and it kind of shows</p>
<p>the relationship</p>
<p>and what happened</p>
<p>a lot of the families say that</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a movie</p>
<p>so a lot of parts are over exaggerated</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not very factual</p>
<p>but it is a pretty good movie</p>
<p>if you wanna watch it</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>yeah so that&rsquo;s the story</p>
<p>sad gross and sad</p>
<p>I feel really bad for Tony</p>
<p>I mean um he had a pretty</p>
<p>rough ass life</p>
<p>and Barbara</p>
<p>over here suck balls</p>
<p>like she sucked</p>
<p>it just goes to show you</p>
<p>you could be the</p>
<p>richest little bitch in the world</p>
<p>but guess what baby</p>
<p>your life still probably sucks</p>
<p>Barbara was a piece of shit</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t know what else to say</p>
<p>I hope you have a wonderful day today</p>
<p>you make good choices</p>
<p>I appreciate you guys so much for always sending</p>
<p>suggestions</p>
<p>it means so much</p>
<p>make good choices</p>
<p>and please be safe out there</p>
<p>okay I&rsquo;ll be seeing you guys later bye</p>
