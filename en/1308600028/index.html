    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk all about hearing and balance</p>
<p>and how you can use your ability to hear specific things</p>
<p>and your balance system in order to learn anything faster.</p>
<p>The auditory system, meaning the hearing system</p>
<p>and your balance system,</p>
<p>which is called the vestibular system,</p>
<p>interact with all the other systems of the brain and body</p>
<p>and used properly,</p>
<p>can allow you to learn information more quickly,</p>
<p>remember that information longer and with more ease,</p>
<p>and you can also improve the way you can hear.</p>
<p>You can improve your balance.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about tools for all of that.</p>
<p>This is one area of science</p>
<p>where we understand a lot about the cells</p>
<p>and the mechanisms in the ear and in the brain and so forth.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to talk about that a little bit,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re going to get directly into protocols,</p>
<p>meaning tools.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also going to talk about ways</p>
<p>in which the auditory and balance systems suffer.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about tinnitus,</p>
<p>which is this ringing of the ears</p>
<p>that unfortunately for people that suffer from it,</p>
<p>they really suffer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very intrusive for them.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about some treatments</p>
<p>that can work in some circumstances,</p>
<p>and some of the more recent emerging treatments</p>
<p>that I think many people aren&rsquo;t aware of.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also going to talk about this,</p>
<p>what seems like kind of a weird fact,</p>
<p>which is that 70% of people, all people,</p>
<p>make what are called autoacoustic emissions.</p>
<p>Their ears actually make noises.</p>
<p>Chances are your ears are making noises right now,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t perceive them,</p>
<p>and yet those can have an influence on other people</p>
<p>and animals in your environment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating aspect to your biology.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to learn a lot about how your biology</p>
<p>and brain and ears and the so-called inner ear</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s associated with balance.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to learn a lot about how all those work.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to learn a lot of neuroscience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll even tell you what type of music to listen to,</p>
<p>and if you listen to me,</p>
<p>you can leverage that in order to learn faster.</p>
<p>Before we begin talking about the science</p>
<p>of hearing and balance and tools that leverage</p>
<p>hearing and balance for learning faster,</p>
<p>I want to provide some information</p>
<p>about another way to learn much faster.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a paper that was published recently.</p>
<p>This is a paper that was published in Cell Reports,</p>
<p>an excellent journal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a peer-reviewed paper from a really excellent group</p>
<p>looking at skill learning.</p>
<p>Now, previously, I&rsquo;ve talked about how</p>
<p>in the attempt to learn skills,</p>
<p>the vital thing to do is to get lots of repetitions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve heard of the 10,000 hours thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve heard of lots of different strategies</p>
<p>for learning faster, 80-20 rule and all that.</p>
<p>The bottom line is you need to generate many,</p>
<p>many repetitions of something that you&rsquo;re trying to learn,</p>
<p>and the errors that you generate</p>
<p>are also very important for learning.</p>
<p>It also turns out that taking rest</p>
<p>within the learning episode is very important.</p>
<p>I want to be really clear what I&rsquo;m referring to here.</p>
<p>In earlier episodes, I&rsquo;ve discussed how</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trying to learn something, it&rsquo;s beneficial,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been shown in scientific studies</p>
<p>that if you take a 20-minute shallow nap</p>
<p>or you simply do nothing after a period of learning,</p>
<p>that it enhances the rates of learning</p>
<p>and the depth of learning,</p>
<p>your ability to learn and remember that information.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m about to describe are new data</p>
<p>that say that you actually should be injecting rest</p>
<p>within the learning episode.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about going to sleep while learning.</p>
<p>This is the way that the study was done.</p>
<p>The study involved having people learn sequences of numbers</p>
<p>or keys on a piano.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s use the keys on a piano example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a musician, but I think I&rsquo;ll get this correct.</p>
<p>They asked people to practice a sequence of keys, G, D, F, E,</p>
<p>G, G, D, F, E, G, G, D, F, E, G.</p>
<p>And they would practice that either continually</p>
<p>for a given amount of time</p>
<p>or they would just do that for 10 seconds.</p>
<p>They would play G, D, F, E, G, G, D, F, E, G,</p>
<p>G, D, F, E, G, G, D, F, E, G for 10 seconds.</p>
<p>And then they would take a 10-second pause, a rest.</p>
<p>They would just take a space or a period of time</p>
<p>where they do nothing for 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Then they would go back to G, D, F, E, G, G, D, F, E, G.</p>
<p>So the two conditions essentially</p>
<p>were to have people practice continually,</p>
<p>lots of repetitions,</p>
<p>or to inject or insert these periods</p>
<p>of 10-seconds idle time</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re not doing anything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not looking at their phone.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not focusing on anything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just letting their mind drift</p>
<p>wherever it wants to go.</p>
<p>And they are not touching the keys on the keyboard.</p>
<p>What they found was that the rates of learning,</p>
<p>the skill acquisition and the retention of the skills</p>
<p>was significantly faster</p>
<p>when they injected these short periods of rest,</p>
<p>these 10-second rest periods.</p>
<p>The rates of learning were,</p>
<p>when I say significantly faster, were much, much faster.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll reveal what that was in just a moment.</p>
<p>But you might ask, why would this work?</p>
<p>Why would it be that injecting these 10-second rest periods</p>
<p>would enhance rates of learning?</p>
<p>What they called them was micro-offline gains</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re sort of taking their brain offline</p>
<p>from the learning task for a moment.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out the brain isn&rsquo;t going offline at all.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard of the hippocampus,</p>
<p>the area of the brain involved in memory,</p>
<p>and the neocortex, the area of the brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s involved in processing sensory information.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that during these brief periods of rest,</p>
<p>these 10-second rest periods,</p>
<p>the hippocampus and the cortex are active in ways</p>
<p>such that you get a 20 times repeat of the GD-FEG.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a temporal compression, as they say.</p>
<p>So basically the rehearsal continues while you rest,</p>
<p>but at 20 times the speed.</p>
<p>So if you were normally getting just,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say five repetitions of GD-FEG,</p>
<p>GD-FEG, GD-FEG per 10 seconds,</p>
<p>now you multiply that times 20.</p>
<p>In the rest periods, you&rsquo;ve practiced it a hundred times.</p>
<p>Your brain has practiced it.</p>
<p>We know this because they were doing brain imaging,</p>
<p>functional imaging of these people with brain scanners</p>
<p>while they were doing this.</p>
<p>This is an absolutely staggering effect.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one that, believe it or not,</p>
<p>has been hypothesized or thought to exist</p>
<p>for a very long time.</p>
<p>This effect is called the spacing effect,</p>
<p>and it was actually first proposed by Ebbington in 1885.</p>
<p>And since then, it&rsquo;s been demonstrated</p>
<p>for a huge number of different,</p>
<p>what they call domains, in the cognitive domain,</p>
<p>so for learning languages, in the physical domain,</p>
<p>so for learning skills that involve a motor sequence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been demonstrated for a huge number</p>
<p>of different categories of learning.</p>
<p>If you want to learn all about the spacing effect</p>
<p>and the categories of learning that it can impact,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a wonderful review article.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll provide a link to it.</p>
<p>The title of the review article is</p>
<p>Parallels Between Spacing Effects</p>
<p>During Behavioral and Cellular Learning.</p>
<p>What that review really does is it ties</p>
<p>the behavioral learning and the improvement of skill</p>
<p>to the underlying changes in neurons</p>
<p>that can explain that learning.</p>
<p>I should mention that the paper that I&rsquo;m referring to,</p>
<p>the more recent paper that injects</p>
<p>these 10-second little micro-offline gains rest periods,</p>
<p>is the work of the laboratory of Leonard Cohen,</p>
<p>not the musician Leonard Cohen.</p>
<p>He passed away.</p>
<p>He was not a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>a wonderful poet and musician, but not a neuroscientist.</p>
<p>Again, the paper was published in Cell Reports,</p>
<p>and we will provide a link to the full paper as well.</p>
<p>So the takeaway is if you&rsquo;re trying to learn something,</p>
<p>you need to get those reps in,</p>
<p>but one way that you can get 20 times</p>
<p>the number of reps in is by injecting</p>
<p>these little 10-second periods of doing nothing.</p>
<p>Again, during those rest periods,</p>
<p>you really don&rsquo;t want to attend to anything else</p>
<p>as much as possible.</p>
<p>You could close your eyes if you want,</p>
<p>or you can just simply wait</p>
<p>and then get right back into generating repetitions.</p>
<p>I find these papers that Cell Reports</p>
<p>and other journals have been publishing recently</p>
<p>to be fascinating because they&rsquo;re really helping us</p>
<p>understand what are the best protocols</p>
<p>for learning anything,</p>
<p>and they really leverage the fact</p>
<p>that the brain is willing to generate repetitions for us</p>
<p>provided that we give it the rest that it needs.</p>
<p>So inject rest throughout the learning period,</p>
<p>and if you can, based on the scientific data,</p>
<p>you would also want to take a 20-minute nap</p>
<p>or a 20-minute decompressed period</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not doing anything after a period of learning.</p>
<p>I think those could both synergize</p>
<p>in order to enhance learning even further,</p>
<p>although that hasn&rsquo;t been looked at yet.</p>
<p>Before we begin talking about hearing and balance,</p>
<p>I just want to mention that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I want to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast</p>
<p>and make it clear that we only work with sponsors</p>
<p>whose products we absolutely love</p>
<p>and that we think you will benefit from as well.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3</p>
<p>and K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need</p>
<p>and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase, they&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally,</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Can you hear me?</p>
<p>Can you hear me?</p>
<p>Okay, well, if you can hear me, that&rsquo;s amazing,</p>
<p>because what it means is that my voice</p>
<p>is causing little tiny changes in the airwaves,</p>
<p>wherever you happen to be,</p>
<p>and that your ears and whatever&rsquo;s contained in those ears</p>
<p>and in your brain can take those sound waves</p>
<p>and make sense of them.</p>
<p>And that is an absolutely fantastic</p>
<p>and staggering feat of biology,</p>
<p>and yet we understand a lot about how that process works.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to teach it to you now in simple terms</p>
<p>over the next few minutes.</p>
<p>So what we call ears have a technical name.</p>
<p>That technical name is auricles,</p>
<p>but more often they&rsquo;re called pinna,</p>
<p>the pinnas, P-I-N-N-A, pinna.</p>
<p>And the pinnas of your ears,</p>
<p>this outer part that is made of cartilage and stuff,</p>
<p>is arranged such that it can capture sound</p>
<p>in the best way for your head size.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about ear size also,</p>
<p>because it turns out that your ears change size</p>
<p>across the lifespan, and that how big your ears are,</p>
<p>or rather how fast your ears are changing size,</p>
<p>is a pretty good indication of how fast you&rsquo;re aging.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll get to that in a few minutes,</p>
<p>but I want to talk about these things that we call ears</p>
<p>and some of the stuff contained within them</p>
<p>that allow us to hear.</p>
<p>So the shape of these ears that we have</p>
<p>is such that it amplifies high-frequency sounds.</p>
<p>High-frequency sounds, as the name suggests,</p>
<p>are the squeakier stuff, right?</p>
<p>So low-frequency sound.</p>
<p>Costello snoring in the background,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a low-frequency sound.</p>
<p>Or high-frequency sound, okay?</p>
<p>So we have low-frequency sounds and high-frequency sounds</p>
<p>and everything in between.</p>
<p>Now, those sound waves get captured by our ears,</p>
<p>and those sound waves, for those of you that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>maybe fully conceptualize sound waves,</p>
<p>are literally just fluctuations or shifts</p>
<p>in the way that air is moving</p>
<p>toward your ear and through space.</p>
<p>In the same way that water can have waves,</p>
<p>air can have waves, okay?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s reverberation of air.</p>
<p>Those come in through your ears</p>
<p>and you have what&rsquo;s called your eardrum.</p>
<p>And on the inside of your eardrum,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little bony thing that&rsquo;s shaped</p>
<p>like a little hammer.</p>
<p>So attached to that eardrum,</p>
<p>which can move back and forth like a drum,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a little membrane,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got this hammer attached to it.</p>
<p>And that hammer has three parts.</p>
<p>For those of you that want to know,</p>
<p>those three parts are called the malleus,</p>
<p>incus, and stapes.</p>
<p>But basically, you can just think about it as a hammer.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got this eardrum and then a hammer,</p>
<p>and then that hammer has to hammer on something.</p>
<p>And what it does is it hammers</p>
<p>on a little coiled piece of tissue</p>
<p>that we call the cochlea, sometimes called the cochlea,</p>
<p>depending on where somebody lives in the country.</p>
<p>So typically in the Midwest, on the East Coast,</p>
<p>they call them cochlea,</p>
<p>and on the West Coast, we call them cochlea, same thing.</p>
<p>So this snail-shaped structure in your inner ear</p>
<p>is where sound gets converted into electrical signals</p>
<p>that the brain can understand.</p>
<p>But I want to just bring your attention</p>
<p>to that little hammer,</p>
<p>because that little hammer is really, really cool.</p>
<p>What it means is that sound waves come in through your ears,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening right now,</p>
<p>that eardrum that you have, it&rsquo;s like the top of a drum,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a membrane, or it can move back and forth,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not super rigid, and it moves that little hammer,</p>
<p>and then the hammer goes,</p>
<p>dun-dun-dun-dun-dun, and hits this coil-shaped thing</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re calling the cochlea, okay?</p>
<p>Now, the cochlea, at one end,</p>
<p>is more rigid than the other.</p>
<p>So one part can move really easily,</p>
<p>and the other part doesn&rsquo;t move very easily.</p>
<p>And that turns out to be very important</p>
<p>for decoding or separating sounds that are low-frequency,</p>
<p>like Costello&rsquo;s snoring,</p>
<p>and sounds that are of high-frequency,</p>
<p>like a shriek or a shrill.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because within that little coiled thing</p>
<p>we call the cochlea,</p>
<p>you have all these tiny little, what are called hair cells.</p>
<p>Now, they look like hairs,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not at all related to the hairs on your head</p>
<p>or elsewhere on your body.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just shaped like hair, so we call them hair cells.</p>
<p>Those hair cells, if they move,</p>
<p>send signals into the brain</p>
<p>that a particular sound is in our environment.</p>
<p>And if those hair cells don&rsquo;t move,</p>
<p>it means that particular sound is not in our environment.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>So just to give you the mental picture of this,</p>
<p>sound waves are coming in</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s stuff out there making noises,</p>
<p>like my voice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s changing the patterns of air around you</p>
<p>in very, very subtle ways.</p>
<p>That information is getting funneled into your ears</p>
<p>because your pinnas are shaped in a particular way.</p>
<p>The eardrum then moves this little hammer</p>
<p>and the hammer bangs on this little snail-shaped thing.</p>
<p>And because that snail-shaped thing at one end</p>
<p>is very rigid, it doesn&rsquo;t want to move,</p>
<p>and at the other end, it&rsquo;s very flexible,</p>
<p>it can separate out high-frequency and low-frequency sounds.</p>
<p>And the fact that this thing in your inner ear</p>
<p>that we call the cochlea is coiled</p>
<p>is actually really important to understand</p>
<p>because along its length,</p>
<p>it varies in how rigid or flexible it is.</p>
<p>I already mentioned that before.</p>
<p>And at the base, it&rsquo;s very rigid.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the hair cells, if they move,</p>
<p>will make high-frequency sounds.</p>
<p>And at the top, what&rsquo;s called the apex,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very flexible and it&rsquo;s more like a bass drum.</p>
<p>So basically what happens is sound waves come into your ears</p>
<p>and then at one end of this thing that we call the cochlea,</p>
<p>at the top, it&rsquo;s essentially encoding</p>
<p>or only responding to sounds like doom, doom, doom, doom,</p>
<p>whereas at the bottom,</p>
<p>it responds to high-frequency sounds like a cymbal,</p>
<p>tss, tss, tss, tss, tss, tss, tss, tss, tss, tss, okay?</p>
<p>And everywhere in between,</p>
<p>we have other frequencies, medium frequencies.</p>
<p>Now, this should stagger your mind.</p>
<p>If it doesn&rsquo;t already, it should</p>
<p>because what this means</p>
<p>is that everything that&rsquo;s happening around us,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s music or voices or crying or screaming</p>
<p>or screaming of delight from small children</p>
<p>who are excited because they&rsquo;re playing</p>
<p>or because they get cake,</p>
<p>all of that is being broken down into its component parts.</p>
<p>And then your brain is making sense of what it means.</p>
<p>These things that I&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>like the pinna of your ears</p>
<p>and this little hammer and the cochlea,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all purely mechanical.</p>
<p>It has no mind of its own.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just breaking things down into high frequencies,</p>
<p>medium frequencies, and low frequencies.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t understand sound frequency,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really simple to understand.</p>
<p>Just imagine ripples on a pond,</p>
<p>and if those ripples are very close together,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s high frequency.</p>
<p>They occur at high frequency.</p>
<p>If those ripples are further apart, it&rsquo;s low frequency.</p>
<p>And obviously, medium frequency is in between.</p>
<p>So just like you can have waves in water,</p>
<p>you can have waves in air.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really how it works.</p>
<p>Now, we are all familiar with light</p>
<p>and how if you take a prism and put it in front of light,</p>
<p>it will split that light into its different wavelengths,</p>
<p>its different colors, red, green, blue, et cetera, right?</p>
<p>So like the Pink Floyd, Dark Side of the Moon album,</p>
<p>I think has a prism,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s converting white light into all the colors,</p>
<p>all the wavelengths that are contained in white light.</p>
<p>Your cochlea essentially acts as a prism.</p>
<p>It takes all the sound in your environment</p>
<p>and it splits up those sounds into different frequencies.</p>
<p>So you can think of the cochlea of your ear</p>
<p>sort of like a prism,</p>
<p>and then the brain takes that information</p>
<p>and puts it back together and makes sense of it.</p>
<p>So those hair cells in each of your two cochlea,</p>
<p>because you have two ears, you also have two cochlea,</p>
<p>send little wires, what we call axons,</p>
<p>that convey their patterns of activity into the brain.</p>
<p>And there are a number of different stations</p>
<p>within the brain that information arrives at</p>
<p>before it gets up to the parts of your brain</p>
<p>where you are consciously aware.</p>
<p>And because some of you have asked for more names</p>
<p>and nomenclature, I&rsquo;ll give that to you.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want a lot of detailed names,</p>
<p>you can just ignore what I&rsquo;m about to say,</p>
<p>but basically the cochlea send information</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s called the spiral ganglion.</p>
<p>The spiral ganglion, a ganglion, by the way,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to learn any neuroscience,</p>
<p>just know that anytime you hear ganglion,</p>
<p>a ganglion is just a clump.</p>
<p>So it means a bunch of neurons.</p>
<p>So a clump of cells.</p>
<p>So the spiral ganglion is a bunch of neurons</p>
<p>that the information then goes off</p>
<p>to what are called the cochlear nuclei in the brainstem.</p>
<p>Brainstem is kind of down near your neck,</p>
<p>then up to a structure that has a really cool name</p>
<p>called the superior olive,</p>
<p>because you have one on each side of your brain.</p>
<p>And if I were to bring you to my lab</p>
<p>and show you the superior olives in your brain</p>
<p>or anyone else&rsquo;s brain, they look like little olives.</p>
<p>They even have a little divot in them</p>
<p>that to me looks like a pimiento,</p>
<p>but they just call them the superior olive.</p>
<p>And then the neurons in the superior olive,</p>
<p>then they send information up</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s called the inferior colliculus,</p>
<p>only called inferior because it sits below</p>
<p>a structure called the superior colliculus.</p>
<p>And then the information goes up</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s called the medial geniculate nucleus,</p>
<p>and then up to your neocortex,</p>
<p>where you make sense of it all.</p>
<p>Now, you don&rsquo;t have to remember all that,</p>
<p>but you should know that there are a lot of stations</p>
<p>in which auditory information is processed</p>
<p>before it gets up to our conscious detection.</p>
<p>And there is a good reason for that,</p>
<p>which is that more important than knowing</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re hearing,</p>
<p>you need to know where it&rsquo;s coming from.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s vital to our survival that if something, for instance,</p>
<p>is falling toward us,</p>
<p>that we know if it&rsquo;s coming to our right side,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s going to hit us from behind.</p>
<p>We have to know, for instance,</p>
<p>if a car is coming at us from our left or from our right.</p>
<p>And our visual system can help with that.</p>
<p>But our auditory and our visual system collaborate</p>
<p>to help us find and locate the position of things in space.</p>
<p>That should come as no surprise.</p>
<p>If you hear somebody talking off to your right,</p>
<p>you tend to turn to your right, not to your left.</p>
<p>If you see somebody&rsquo;s mouth moving in front of you,</p>
<p>you tend to assume that the sound</p>
<p>is going to come from right in front of you.</p>
<p>Disruptions in this auditory hearing and visual matching</p>
<p>are actually the basis of what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>the ventriloquism effect,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll talk about in a few minutes in more depth.</p>
<p>But the ventriloquism effect can basically be described</p>
<p>in simple terms as when you essentially think</p>
<p>that a sound is coming from a location</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not actually coming from.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about that in a moment,</p>
<p>but what I&rsquo;d like you to realize</p>
<p>is that one of these stations deep in your brainstem</p>
<p>is responsible for helping you identify</p>
<p>where sounds are coming from</p>
<p>through a process that&rsquo;s called interaural time differences.</p>
<p>And that sounds fancy,</p>
<p>but really the way you know where things are coming from,</p>
<p>what direction a car or a bus or a person is coming from</p>
<p>is because the sound lands in one ear before the other.</p>
<p>And you have stations in your brain,</p>
<p>meaning you have neurons in your brain</p>
<p>that calculate the difference in time of arrival</p>
<p>for those sound waves in your right versus your left ear.</p>
<p>And if they arrive at the same time,</p>
<p>you assume that thing is making noise</p>
<p>right in front of you.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s off to your right,</p>
<p>you assume it&rsquo;s over on your right.</p>
<p>And if the sound arrives first to your left ear,</p>
<p>you assume quite correctly</p>
<p>that the thing is coming toward your left ear.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very simple and kind of mechanical system</p>
<p>at the level of sound localization.</p>
<p>But what about up and down?</p>
<p>If you think about it,</p>
<p>a sound coming from above is going to land</p>
<p>on your right ear and your left ear at the same time.</p>
<p>A sound from below is going to land on your right ear</p>
<p>and your left ear at the same time.</p>
<p>So the way that we know where things are</p>
<p>in terms of what&rsquo;s called elevation,</p>
<p>where they are in the up and down plane</p>
<p>is by the frequencies.</p>
<p>The shape of your ears actually modifies the sound</p>
<p>depending on whether or not it&rsquo;s coming straight at you</p>
<p>from the floor or from high above.</p>
<p>And so already at the level of your ears,</p>
<p>you are taking information about the outside world</p>
<p>and determining where that information is coming from.</p>
<p>Now, this all happens very, very fast in the subconscious,</p>
<p>but now you know why</p>
<p>if people really want to hear something,</p>
<p>they make a cup around their ear.</p>
<p>They essentially make their ear</p>
<p>into more of a fennec fox type ear.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever seen those cute little fennec fox things,</p>
<p>they have these big spiky ears.</p>
<p>They kind of look like a French bulldog,</p>
<p>although they&rsquo;re kind of the fox version</p>
<p>of the French bulldog.</p>
<p>These big, tall ears,</p>
<p>and they have excellent sound localization.</p>
<p>And so when people lean in with their hand like this,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re listening to this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just cupping my hand at my ear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving myself a bigger pinna.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and if I do it on the left side, I do this side.</p>
<p>And if I really want to hear something,</p>
<p>I do it on both sides, okay?</p>
<p>So this isn&rsquo;t just gesturing.</p>
<p>This actually serves a mechanical role.</p>
<p>And actually, if you want to hear</p>
<p>where things are coming from</p>
<p>with a much greater degree of accuracy,</p>
<p>this can actually help</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re capturing sound waves</p>
<p>and funneling them better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really remarkable, this whole system.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got these two ears,</p>
<p>and because of the differences in the timing</p>
<p>of when things arrive in those two ears,</p>
<p>as well as these differences in the frequencies</p>
<p>that certain things sound,</p>
<p>or I should say the differences in the frequencies</p>
<p>that arrive at your ears,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not the thing is above you</p>
<p>or right in front of you or below you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to make out</p>
<p>where things are in space pretty well.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;re probably starting to realize</p>
<p>that these two things on the side of our head</p>
<p>that we call ears are there for a lot more</p>
<p>than hanging earrings on or for other aesthetic purposes</p>
<p>or for putting sunglasses on top of.</p>
<p>They are very powerful devices</p>
<p>for allowing us to capture sound waves from our environment.</p>
<p>Now I have a question for you,</p>
<p>which is, can you move your ears?</p>
<p>Turns out that unlike other animals,</p>
<p>humans are not terrifically good at moving their ears.</p>
<p>Other animals can move their ears even independently.</p>
<p>So Costello is pretty good at raising his ears,</p>
<p>the two of them together.</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t really move his ears separately.</p>
<p>Some dogs can do that really well.</p>
<p>In fact, sight hounds and some scent hounds</p>
<p>do that exquisitely well.</p>
<p>Some animals like deer and other animals</p>
<p>that really have a very acute hearing</p>
<p>will put one ear down to a very particular angle</p>
<p>and will tilt the other one</p>
<p>and they will actually capture information</p>
<p>about two distant sound-making organisms.</p>
<p>Those could be hunters coming after them</p>
<p>or other animals coming after them.</p>
<p>They are very good at doing this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not so good at it,</p>
<p>but about 60% of people, it&rsquo;s thought,</p>
<p>can move their ears consciously</p>
<p>without having to touch their ears.</p>
<p>So can you do that?</p>
<p>Maybe you should try it.</p>
<p>Ask someone to look at you</p>
<p>and see whether or not you can do it.</p>
<p>The typical distances that people can move it</p>
<p>is usually no more than two or three millimeters.</p>
<p>But can you flap your pinna</p>
<p>with just using mental control?</p>
<p>If you can, or if you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>try looking all the way to your right</p>
<p>or all the way to your left.</p>
<p>Obviously, if you&rsquo;re driving a car</p>
<p>or doing something or exercising,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t put yourself in danger right now.</p>
<p>But if you move your eyes all the way to your left,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m doing now,</p>
<p>or all the way to my right,</p>
<p>you might feel a little bit of a contraction of the muscles</p>
<p>that control ear movement, all right?</p>
<p>Now, I want to ask you this.</p>
<p>Can you raise one eyebrow?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not very good at it.</p>
<p>I can do a little bit,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s mostly by cramping down my face on one side,</p>
<p>and I certainly can&rsquo;t raise my right eyebrow.</p>
<p>I can only do my left eyebrow.</p>
<p>Trying to talk while I&rsquo;m doing this,</p>
<p>so this is why it looks strange.</p>
<p>People who can raise one eyebrow very easily</p>
<p>almost always can move their ears</p>
<p>without having to touch them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s controlled by the same motor pathway.</p>
<p>And there does seem to be a small</p>
<p>but statistically significant sex difference</p>
<p>in the ability to move one&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p>Typically, men can do this more than women can,</p>
<p>although plenty of women can move their ears as well.</p>
<p>Now, if you think that is all a little strange</p>
<p>or off topic, it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>because what we&rsquo;re really talking about here</p>
<p>is a system of the brain,</p>
<p>but also of the body, of the musculature</p>
<p>for localizing things in space.</p>
<p>And so you might find it interesting to note</p>
<p>that one of the things that we share very closely</p>
<p>with other primates, with non-human primates,</p>
<p>like macaque monkeys and chimpanzees,</p>
<p>if you look at their ears,</p>
<p>their ears are remarkably similar to our ears,</p>
<p>or rather our ears are remarkably similar to their ears.</p>
<p>The eyes of certain monkeys, like macaque monkeys,</p>
<p>are remarkably similar to human eyes.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why</p>
<p>if you look at a baby macaque monkey,</p>
<p>it has this unbelievably human element to it.</p>
<p>But the ears of these primates is very similar to our ears,</p>
<p>our ears similar to their ears.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in ear movements</p>
<p>and what they could mean,</p>
<p>and some of the things that ear movements correlate with</p>
<p>in other aspects of our biology,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a nice paper, actually, a scientific paper.</p>
<p>The author&rsquo;s last name is Code, C-O-D-E.</p>
<p>It was published in 1995.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give a reference to that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a review article that discusses</p>
<p>some of the sex differences in ear movement control,</p>
<p>as well as the relationship</p>
<p>between ear movements and eye movements.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a pretty accessible paper.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one that I think any of you</p>
<p>who are interested in this topic could parse fairly easily.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some very interesting underlying biology</p>
<p>and some theories as to why humans</p>
<p>would have this so-called vestigial</p>
<p>or ancient carryover of a system for moving our ears.</p>
<p>Now, if ear movement seems strange,</p>
<p>next I want to talk about a different feature</p>
<p>of your hearing and ears that&rsquo;s even stranger,</p>
<p>but that has some really interesting implications</p>
<p>for your biology.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m guessing that you&rsquo;ve not heard of this.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m about to describe are called</p>
<p>autoacoustic emissions.</p>
<p>And autoacoustic emissions, as the name suggests,</p>
<p>are sounds that your ears make.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, 70% of people make noises</p>
<p>with their ears, but they don&rsquo;t actually detect them.</p>
<p>Like I said, you&rsquo;ve never heard of this, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I mean.</p>
<p>But what I do mean is that 70% of people&rsquo;s ears</p>
<p>are making noise that&rsquo;s cast out of the ear.</p>
<p>And these autoacoustic emissions</p>
<p>actually can be detected by microphones.</p>
<p>Sometimes they can be detected by other people in the room</p>
<p>if they have very good hearing.</p>
<p>Now, it turns out that women,</p>
<p>or I should be technical here,</p>
<p>females who report themselves as heterosexual</p>
<p>have a higher frequency, not frequency of sound,</p>
<p>but a higher frequency of autoacoustic emissions</p>
<p>than do men who report themselves as heterosexual.</p>
<p>Women who report themselves as homosexual or bisexual</p>
<p>make fewer autoacoustic emissions than heterosexual women.</p>
<p>These are data that come from Dennis McFadden&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>at the University of Texas, Austin.</p>
<p>He actually discovered these,</p>
<p>what are called sexual dimorphisms</p>
<p>and differences based on sexual orientation</p>
<p>without looking for them.</p>
<p>He was studying hearing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a auditory scientist</p>
<p>and people were coming into his laboratory</p>
<p>and they were detecting these autoacoustic emissions</p>
<p>and they started to notice the group differences</p>
<p>in autoacoustic emissions.</p>
<p>So they started asking people about their sex</p>
<p>and about their sexual orientation.</p>
<p>And these differences fell out of the data, as we say.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting because autoacoustic emissions</p>
<p>are not something that we associate with sex</p>
<p>or sexual dimorphism,</p>
<p>but what these data really underscore is, first of all,</p>
<p>a lot of us are making noises with our ears,</p>
<p>some of us more than others,</p>
<p>and that exposure to certain combinations</p>
<p>of hormones during development</p>
<p>are very likely shaping the way that our hearing apparati,</p>
<p>meaning the cochlea and the pinna and all sorts of things,</p>
<p>how those develop and how those function</p>
<p>throughout the lifespan.</p>
<p>We did do an episode on hormones and sexual development,</p>
<p>which gets much deeper into the other effects</p>
<p>that hormones have on the developing brain and body.</p>
<p>If you want to check out that episode,</p>
<p>we will put a link to it in the captions.</p>
<p>So now I want to shift to talking about</p>
<p>ways to leverage your hearing system, your auditory system,</p>
<p>so that you can learn anything,</p>
<p>not just auditory information, but anything faster.</p>
<p>I get a lot of questions about so-called binaural beats.</p>
<p>Binaural beats, as their name suggests,</p>
<p>involve playing one frequency of sound to one ear</p>
<p>and a different frequency of sound to the other ear.</p>
<p>So it might be,</p>
<p>dun, dun, dun, dun, to your right ear,</p>
<p>and it might be,</p>
<p>dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, to the left ear.</p>
<p>And the idea is that</p>
<p>the brain will take those two frequencies of sound,</p>
<p>and because the pathways that bring information</p>
<p>from the ears into the brain eventually cross over,</p>
<p>they actually share that information</p>
<p>with both sides of the brain,</p>
<p>that the brain will average that information</p>
<p>and come up with a sort of intermediate frequency.</p>
<p>And the rationale is that those intermediate frequencies</p>
<p>place the brain into a state that is better for learning.</p>
<p>And when I say better for learning,</p>
<p>I want to be precise about what I mean.</p>
<p>That could mean more focus for encoding</p>
<p>or bringing the information in.</p>
<p>As you may have heard me say before,</p>
<p>we have to be alert and focused in order to learn.</p>
<p>There is no passive learning</p>
<p>unless we&rsquo;re little tiny infants.</p>
<p>So can binaural beats make us more focused?</p>
<p>Can binaural beats allow us to relax more if we&rsquo;re anxious?</p>
<p>I know some people,</p>
<p>they go to the dentist</p>
<p>and the dentist offers binaural beats</p>
<p>as they drill into your teeth</p>
<p>and give root canals and things of that sort,</p>
<p>probably causing some anxiety</p>
<p>just describing those things right now.</p>
<p>But those are available in several dentists,</p>
<p>many dental practices.</p>
<p>Their binaural beats have been thought</p>
<p>to increase creativity,</p>
<p>or at least have been proposed to increase creativity.</p>
<p>So what are the scientific data say about binaural beats?</p>
<p>There are a number of different apps out there</p>
<p>that offer binaural beats.</p>
<p>There are a number of different programs.</p>
<p>I think you can also even just find these</p>
<p>on YouTube and on the internet.</p>
<p>But typically it&rsquo;s an app</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll program in a particular outcome that you want,</p>
<p>more focused, more creative,</p>
<p>fall asleep, less anxious, et cetera.</p>
<p>So what are the scientific data say?</p>
<p>So believe it or not,</p>
<p>the science on binaural beats is actually quite extensive</p>
<p>and very precise.</p>
<p>So sound waves are measured typically in hertz</p>
<p>or kilohertz.</p>
<p>I know many of you aren&rsquo;t familiar</p>
<p>with thinking about things in hertz or kilohertz.</p>
<p>But again, just remember those waves on a pond,</p>
<p>those ripples on a pond.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re close together,</p>
<p>then they are of high frequency.</p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;re far apart, then they are low frequency.</p>
<p>So when you hear more hertz,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re essentially hearing is higher frequency, right?</p>
<p>And so if it&rsquo;s many more kilohertz,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s much higher frequency</p>
<p>than if it&rsquo;s fewer hertz or kilohertz.</p>
<p>And so you may have heard of these things as delta waves</p>
<p>or theta waves or alpha waves or beta waves, et cetera.</p>
<p>Delta waves would be big, slow waves, so low frequency.</p>
<p>And indeed, there&rsquo;s quality evidence</p>
<p>from peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>that are not sponsored by companies</p>
<p>that make binaural beat apps</p>
<p>that tell us that delta waves like one to four hertz,</p>
<p>so very low frequency sounds,</p>
<p>think Costello&rsquo;s snoring,</p>
<p>can help in the transition to sleep and for staying asleep.</p>
<p>And that theta rhythms,</p>
<p>which are more like four to eight hertz,</p>
<p>can bring the brain into a state of subtle sleep</p>
<p>or meditation.</p>
<p>So deeply relaxed, but not fully asleep.</p>
<p>And then you can sort of ascend the staircase</p>
<p>of findings here, so to speak,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll find evidence that alpha waves,</p>
<p>eight to 13 hertz,</p>
<p>can increase alertness to a moderate level.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great state for the brain to be in</p>
<p>for recall of existing information, okay?</p>
<p>And that beta waves, 15 to 20 hertz,</p>
<p>are great for bringing the brain into focus states</p>
<p>for sustained thought or for incorporating new information,</p>
<p>and especially gamma waves, the highest frequency,</p>
<p>the most frequent ripples of sound, so to speak,</p>
<p>32 to 100 hertz for learning and problem solving.</p>
<p>Now, all of this matches, or I should say,</p>
<p>maps onto what I&rsquo;ve said before</p>
<p>about learning really nicely,</p>
<p>which is that you need to be in a highly alert state</p>
<p>in order to bring new information in,</p>
<p>in order to access a state of mind</p>
<p>in which you can tell your brain,</p>
<p>or the brain is telling itself,</p>
<p>okay, I need to learn this.</p>
<p>This is why stress and unfortunate circumstances</p>
<p>are so memorable,</p>
<p>is because our brain gets into a really high alert system.</p>
<p>Here, we&rsquo;re talking about the use of binaural beats</p>
<p>in order to increase our level of alertness</p>
<p>or our level of calmness.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s important to underscore</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not that there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>fundamentally important about the binaural beats.</p>
<p>They are yet another way of bringing the brain</p>
<p>into states of deep relaxation through low-frequency sound</p>
<p>or highly alert states for focused learning</p>
<p>with more high-frequency sound.</p>
<p>So they are effective,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll review a little bit of the data in detail.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re effective,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re uniquely special for learning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that they can help some people</p>
<p>bring their brain into the state</p>
<p>that allows them to learn better.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of studies that allowed us to arrive,</p>
<p>or I should say allowed the field to arrive</p>
<p>on these parameters of slow low-frequency waves</p>
<p>are going to bring you into relaxed states,</p>
<p>high-frequency waves into more alert states.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very good evidence for anxiety reduction</p>
<p>from the use of binaural beats.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting is the anxiety reduction</p>
<p>seems to be most effective</p>
<p>when the binaural beats are bringing the brain into delta,</p>
<p>so those slow big waves like sleep,</p>
<p>theta and alpha states.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll link to a couple of these studies,</p>
<p>although I will probably link more to the list</p>
<p>that really segregates them out one by one</p>
<p>so you can see them all next to one another.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s good evidence that binaural beats</p>
<p>can be used to treat pain, chronic pain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s three studies in peer-reviewed journals,</p>
<p>which I took a look at,</p>
<p>and they seem to be of good quality,</p>
<p>not sponsored research, as we say,</p>
<p>not paid for by any specific company.</p>
<p>Binaural beats have been shown</p>
<p>to modestly improve cognition, attention,</p>
<p>working memory, and even creativity.</p>
<p>But the real boost from binaural beats</p>
<p>appears to be for anxiety reduction and pain reduction.</p>
<p>Some people might find these beneficial</p>
<p>for these oral surgeries, right?</p>
<p>Believe it or not,</p>
<p>there are people who would rather have</p>
<p>the entire root canal or cavity drilled without Novocaine,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because they sometimes have a syringe phobia</p>
<p>or something of that sort,</p>
<p>or they just don&rsquo;t like being numb from the Novocaine,</p>
<p>or maybe there&rsquo;s an underlying medical reason.</p>
<p>But I think most people don&rsquo;t enjoy</p>
<p>getting their teeth drilled</p>
<p>even if they have Novocaine in there or a root canal.</p>
<p>And so it seems that binaural beats</p>
<p>can be effective in that environment,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have to go into</p>
<p>that sort of extreme environment</p>
<p>to benefit from binaural beats.</p>
<p>Binaural beats are a either</p>
<p>relatively inexpensive thing to access.</p>
<p>Most of the apps are pretty inexpensive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a favorite binaural beats app</p>
<p>to recommend to you.</p>
<p>I confess I did use binaural beats a few years ago.</p>
<p>I shifted over to other, what I call NSDR,</p>
<p>non-sleep deep rest protocols in favor of those.</p>
<p>But many people like binaural beats</p>
<p>and say that they benefit from them,</p>
<p>especially while studying or learning.</p>
<p>I think part of the reason for that</p>
<p>relates to the ability to channel our focus</p>
<p>when we have some background noise.</p>
<p>And this is something I also get asked about a lot.</p>
<p>Is it better to listen to music</p>
<p>and have background noise when studying,</p>
<p>or is it better to have complete silence?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s actually a quite good literature</p>
<p>on this as well,</p>
<p>but not so much as it relates to binaural beats,</p>
<p>but rather whether or not people are listening to music,</p>
<p>so-called white noise, brown noise,</p>
<p>believe it or not, there&rsquo;s white noise</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s brown noise, there&rsquo;s even pink noise,</p>
<p>and how that impacts brain states</p>
<p>that allow us to learn information better or not.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;d like to talk about white noise.</p>
<p>And I want to be very clear that white noise</p>
<p>has been shown to really enhance brain states for learning</p>
<p>in certain individuals, in particular in adults,</p>
<p>but white noise actually can have a detrimental effect</p>
<p>on auditory learning</p>
<p>and maybe even the development of the auditory system</p>
<p>in very young children, in particular in infants.</p>
<p>So first I&rsquo;d like to talk about the beneficial effects</p>
<p>of white noise on learning.</p>
<p>There are some really excellent studies on this.</p>
<p>The first one that I&rsquo;d like to just highlight</p>
<p>is one that&rsquo;s entitled</p>
<p>Low Intensity White Noise Improves Performance</p>
<p>in Auditory Working Memory Task, an fMRI study.</p>
<p>This is a study that explored</p>
<p>whether or not learning could be enhanced</p>
<p>by playing white noise in the background.</p>
<p>But the strength of the study is that they looked</p>
<p>at some of the underlying neural circuitry</p>
<p>and the activation of the neural circuitry in these people</p>
<p>as they did the learning task.</p>
<p>And what it essentially illustrates</p>
<p>is that white noise, provided that white noise</p>
<p>is of low enough intensity, meaning not super loud, right?</p>
<p>Not imperceptible, so not so quiet that you can&rsquo;t hear it,</p>
<p>but not super loud either.</p>
<p>It actually could enhance learning to a significant degree.</p>
<p>And this has been shown now for a huge number</p>
<p>of different types of learning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a terrific article as well,</p>
<p>is in a somewhat obscure journal, at least obscure to me,</p>
<p>which is the effects of noise exposure</p>
<p>on cognitive performance and brain activity patterns.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a study involving 54 subjects.</p>
<p>They basically were evaluated</p>
<p>for mental workload and attention</p>
<p>under different levels of noise exposure,</p>
<p>background noise, and different,</p>
<p>essentially loudness of noise.</p>
<p>And the reason I like this study</p>
<p>is that they looked at different levels of noise</p>
<p>and types of noise,</p>
<p>and they varied a number of different things</p>
<p>as opposed to just doing a kind of two condition,</p>
<p>either white noise or no white noise type thing.</p>
<p>And what they found, again,</p>
<p>is that provided the white noise is not extremely loud,</p>
<p>it could really enhance brain function</p>
<p>for sake of learning any number</p>
<p>of different kinds of information.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s all great,</p>
<p>but it really doesn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>to the kind of deeper guts of mechanism.</p>
<p>And as a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>what I really want to see</p>
<p>is not just that something has an effect.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always nice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always nice to see in a nice peer-reviewed study</p>
<p>without any kind of commercial biases</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s an effect, okay?</p>
<p>Binaural beats can enhance learning</p>
<p>or listening to white noise, not too loud,</p>
<p>can enhance learning.</p>
<p>But you really want to understand mechanism</p>
<p>because once you understand mechanism,</p>
<p>not only does it start to make sense,</p>
<p>but you can also imagine ways</p>
<p>in which you could develop better tools and protocols.</p>
<p>So I was very relieved to find,</p>
<p>or I should say excited to find this study published</p>
<p>in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience.</p>
<p>This is a 2014 paper.</p>
<p>White noise improves learning by modulating activity</p>
<p>in dopaminergic midbrain regions</p>
<p>and the right superior temporal sulcus, okay?</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t expect you to know</p>
<p>what the right superior temporal sulcus is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect you to know</p>
<p>what the dopamine midbrain region is,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re like me,</p>
<p>you probably took highlighted notice</p>
<p>of the word dopaminergic.</p>
<p>Dopamine is a neuromodulator,</p>
<p>meaning it&rsquo;s a chemical that&rsquo;s released in our brain</p>
<p>and body, but mostly in our brain,</p>
<p>that modulates, meaning controls the likelihood</p>
<p>that certain brain areas will be active</p>
<p>and other brain areas won&rsquo;t be active.</p>
<p>And dopamine is associated with motivation.</p>
<p>Dopamine is associated with craving.</p>
<p>Motivation is associated with all sorts of different things,</p>
<p>including movement.</p>
<p>But what this study so nicely shows</p>
<p>is that white noise can really enhance the activity</p>
<p>of neurons in what&rsquo;s called the substantia nigra VTA.</p>
<p>The substantia nigra VTA is a very rich source of dopamine.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s very chock-a-block full</p>
<p>of dopamine neurons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an area of the brain that is perhaps</p>
<p>the richest source of dopamine neurons.</p>
<p>And you actually can see this brain region</p>
<p>under the microscope, if you take a slice of brain</p>
<p>or you look at a brain without even staining it</p>
<p>for any proteins or dopamine or anything,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s two very dark regions at the kind of bottom</p>
<p>of the brain.</p>
<p>And the reason it&rsquo;s called substantia nigra,</p>
<p>nigra meaning dark, is because the dopamine neurons</p>
<p>actually make something that makes those neurons dark.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;ve got these two regions down there</p>
<p>that contain dopamine and can release dopamine</p>
<p>and essentially activate other brain regions</p>
<p>and activate our sense of motivation</p>
<p>and activate our sense of desire</p>
<p>to continue focusing and learning.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t just snap your fingers</p>
<p>and make them release dopamine.</p>
<p>You actually have to trigger dopamine release from them.</p>
<p>Now that trigger can be caused</p>
<p>by being very excited about something</p>
<p>or the fact that that thing gave you a lot of pleasure</p>
<p>in the past, or you&rsquo;re highly motivated by fear or desire.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s so interesting to me is that it appears</p>
<p>that white noise itself can raise</p>
<p>what we call the basal, the baseline levels of dopamine</p>
<p>that are being released from this area,</p>
<p>the substantia nigra.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re starting to get a more full picture</p>
<p>of how particular sounds in our environment</p>
<p>can increase learning.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s in part, I believe,</p>
<p>through the release of dopamine from substantia nigra.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not trying to shift you away from binaural beats</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s your thing,</p>
<p>but it does appear that turning on white noise</p>
<p>at a low level, not too loud.</p>
<p>You may say, well, how loud?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you in a moment,</p>
<p>but not too loud can allow you to learn better</p>
<p>because of the ways that it&rsquo;s modulating</p>
<p>your brain chemistry.</p>
<p>So how loud or how soft should that white noise be</p>
<p>while you learn?</p>
<p>Well, in these studies,</p>
<p>it seemed that white noise that could be heard</p>
<p>by the person, so it wasn&rsquo;t imperceptible to them,</p>
<p>so it was loud enough that they could hear,</p>
<p>but not so loud that they felt it was intrusive</p>
<p>or irritating to them, okay?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to differ from person to person</p>
<p>because people have different levels</p>
<p>of auditory sensitivity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to depend on age,</p>
<p>going to depend on a number of different factors.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t tell you, turn to level two</p>
<p>on your volume controller.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just not going to work.</p>
<p>Also, I don&rsquo;t know how far you are</p>
<p>from a given speaker in the room,</p>
<p>or if you got earphones in your head,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve got speakers in the room,</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s coming out of your computer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know those things.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re going to have to do</p>
<p>is adjust that white noise to a place</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s not interfering with your ability to focus,</p>
<p>but rather it&rsquo;s enhancing your ability to focus.</p>
<p>I think a good rule of thumb is going to be</p>
<p>to put it probably in the lower third</p>
<p>of any kind of volume dial,</p>
<p>as opposed to in the upper third</p>
<p>where it would really be blasting.</p>
<p>And really blasting any noise, frankly, is not good,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s especially not good,</p>
<p>meaning it&rsquo;s especially bad if you have headphones in.</p>
<p>I do want to mention something about headphones</p>
<p>before I talk about white noise</p>
<p>in the developmental context</p>
<p>and why it can be dangerous there.</p>
<p>When you put headphones in your ears,</p>
<p>it has this incredible effect of making the sounds</p>
<p>like they come from inside your head,</p>
<p>not from out in the room.</p>
<p>And now that might seem like kind of a duh,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s actually really amazing, right?</p>
<p>Your brain assumes that the sounds</p>
<p>are coming from inside your head</p>
<p>as opposed from the environment that you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>the moment you put headphones in.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re listening to an audio book</p>
<p>or maybe you&rsquo;re listening to this podcast with headphones,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very different</p>
<p>than when you&rsquo;re listening to something out in the room</p>
<p>and there are other sounds, other sound waves,</p>
<p>especially if you use these noise cancellation headphones.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to use white noise</p>
<p>to enhance studying or learning of any kind,</p>
<p>or this also could be for skill learning,</p>
<p>motor skill learning while you&rsquo;re exercising,</p>
<p>my suggestion would be that if you&rsquo;re using headphones</p>
<p>to keep it quite low, right?</p>
<p>This is an effect on the midbrain dopamine neurons.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a background effect</p>
<p>of raising the baseline of dopamine release.</p>
<p>The way that dopamine neurons fires, they&rsquo;re always firing.</p>
<p>Yours are firing right now, so are mine.</p>
<p>When something exciting happens, they fire a lot.</p>
<p>And when something disappointing happens,</p>
<p>that firing, the release of dopamine</p>
<p>goes down below baseline.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re talking about here</p>
<p>is raising your overall levels of attention and motivation,</p>
<p>which translate to better learning</p>
<p>by just tickling those neurons a little bit,</p>
<p>raising the baseline, firing, okay?</p>
<p>So this isn&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re not turning up the white noise</p>
<p>to the point where you&rsquo;re feeling amazing.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t like turning on your favorite song.</p>
<p>This is actually the opposite.</p>
<p>This is about getting that baseline up just a bit, okay?</p>
<p>So I recommend turning the volume up just a bit</p>
<p>so that you can focus entirely on the task</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>And of course, you&rsquo;ve turned on white noise</p>
<p>so your attention might drift to that for a moment.</p>
<p>Is it too loud? Is it too soft?</p>
<p>If you can disappear into the work, so to speak,</p>
<p>if your attention can disappear into the work,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s probably sufficiently quiet.</p>
<p>And for those of you that say,</p>
<p>well, I like really loud music,</p>
<p>and if I just blast the music,</p>
<p>then I forget about the music.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t suggest blasting music.</p>
<p>And this is coming from somebody</p>
<p>who really likes loud music.</p>
<p>I grew up with kind of a loud, fast rules mentality.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t know what loud, fast rules means,</p>
<p>then I can&rsquo;t help you.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a time and a place perhaps</p>
<p>to listen to music loud, but especially with headphones,</p>
<p>you can trigger, excuse me, hearing loss quite rapidly.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, because these hair cells</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>our central nervous system neurons,</p>
<p>they do not regenerate, they do not come back.</p>
<p>Now, along the lines of hearing loss,</p>
<p>I should just say that the best way</p>
<p>to blow out your hearing for good,</p>
<p>to eliminate your hearing,</p>
<p>is to have very loud sounds superimposed</p>
<p>on a loud environment, okay?</p>
<p>So loud environments can cause hearing loss over time.</p>
<p>So if you work at a construction site clanging really loud,</p>
<p>or if you work the soundboard in a club or something,</p>
<p>you are headed towards hearing loss,</p>
<p>unless you protect your hearing</p>
<p>with earplugs and headphones.</p>
<p>Nowadays, some of the earplugs are very low profile,</p>
<p>meaning you can&rsquo;t see them.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of nice.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not like the, like when I was younger,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t want to be the dork</p>
<p>to go to the concert with the earplugs,</p>
<p>but turns out those dorks were smarter than everybody else</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not the ones who are craning their neck</p>
<p>to try and hear trivial things at the age of 30 or so</p>
<p>because they blew out their hearing.</p>
<p>So if you are working in a loud environment</p>
<p>or you expose yourselves to a loud environment,</p>
<p>you really want to avoid big inflections</p>
<p>in sound above that.</p>
<p>So loud environment plus fireworks,</p>
<p>loud environment plus gunshot,</p>
<p>loud environments plus very high-frequency intense sound,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we call the two-hit model.</p>
<p>When you, this is also true for concussion,</p>
<p>that you can take a kind of a stimulus</p>
<p>that normally would be below the threshold of injury.</p>
<p>You add another stimulus at the same time</p>
<p>that would be below the threshold of injury,</p>
<p>and then suddenly you killed the neurons.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to make people paranoid,</p>
<p>but you do want to protect your hearing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no fun to lose your hearing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to use headphones</p>
<p>and you feel like you want to crank it up all the way,</p>
<p>just remember that the more that you can get</p>
<p>out of a lower volume,</p>
<p>meaning the longer that you can go listening</p>
<p>to things at lower volume,</p>
<p>the longer you&rsquo;ll be able to hear that music or that thing.</p>
<p>So again, I&rsquo;m not the hearing cop, that&rsquo;s not my job,</p>
<p>but as somebody who&rsquo;s lost</p>
<p>some of his high-frequency hearing,</p>
<p>I can tell you it&rsquo;s not a pleasure.</p>
<p>The old argument that it helps you not have to hear</p>
<p>or listen to people that you don&rsquo;t want to listen to,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t really work.</p>
<p>They just send you text messages instead.</p>
<p>So what about white noise and hearing loss in development?</p>
<p>You know, a lot of people with children</p>
<p>have these kind of noise machines,</p>
<p>like sound waves and things like that,</p>
<p>that help the kids sleep.</p>
<p>And look, I think kids getting good sleep</p>
<p>and parents getting good sleep is vital</p>
<p>to physical and mental health and family health.</p>
<p>So I certainly sympathize with those needs.</p>
<p>However, there are data that indicate</p>
<p>that white noise during development</p>
<p>can be detrimental to the auditory system.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to frighten any parents.</p>
<p>If you played white noise to your kids,</p>
<p>this doesn&rsquo;t mean that their auditory system</p>
<p>or their speech patterns are going to be disrupted</p>
<p>or that their interpretation of speech</p>
<p>is going to be disrupted forever.</p>
<p>But there are data published in the journal Science,</p>
<p>and Science being one of the three apex journals,</p>
<p>Science, Nature, Cell, the most stringent journals.</p>
<p>Data published in the journal Science some years ago,</p>
<p>actually by a scientist who I know quite well.</p>
<p>His name is Edward Chang.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a medical doctor now.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a neurosurgeon.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s actually the chair of neurosurgery at UCSF.</p>
<p>And he runs a laboratory where they study</p>
<p>auditory learning, neuroplasticity, et cetera.</p>
<p>He and his mentor at the time, Mike Merzenich,</p>
<p>published a paper showing that if young animals,</p>
<p>and this was in animal models,</p>
<p>were exposed to white noise.</p>
<p>So, the very type of noise that I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>as a older person, and when I say older,</p>
<p>I mean somebody who&rsquo;s in their late teens,</p>
<p>early twenties and older,</p>
<p>could benefit from listening to that</p>
<p>at a low level in the background for sake of learning.</p>
<p>Well, when they exposed very young animals</p>
<p>to this white noise, it actually disrupted the maps</p>
<p>of the auditory world within the brain.</p>
<p>Now, we haven&rsquo;t talked about these maps yet,</p>
<p>but I want to take a moment and talk about them</p>
<p>and explain this effect and what it might mean for you</p>
<p>if you have kids or if you were exposed</p>
<p>to a lot of white noise early on.</p>
<p>So, auditory information goes up into our cortex,</p>
<p>into essentially the outside portion of our brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s responsible for all of our higher level cognition,</p>
<p>our planning, our decision-making, et cetera, creativity.</p>
<p>And up there, we have what are called tonotopic maps.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a tonotopic map?</p>
<p>Well, remember the cochlea, how it&rsquo;s coiled,</p>
<p>and at one end it responds to high frequencies</p>
<p>and the other end it responds to low frequencies?</p>
<p>Sort of like a piano, the keys sound different</p>
<p>as you extend down and up the piano keys,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s organized in a very systematic way, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all intermixed high frequencies</p>
<p>and low frequencies, it&rsquo;s organized in a very systematic way</p>
<p>from one end to the other.</p>
<p>Your visual system is in what&rsquo;s called a retinotopic map.</p>
<p>So, neighboring points in space off to my right,</p>
<p>like my two fingers off to my right,</p>
<p>are mapped to neighboring points in space in my brain.</p>
<p>And the space right in front of me</p>
<p>is mapped to a different location in my brain,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s systematic, it&rsquo;s regular, it&rsquo;s not random,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not salt and pepper.</p>
<p>It goes from high to low or from right to center to left.</p>
<p>In the auditory system,</p>
<p>we have what are called tonotopic maps</p>
<p>where frequency, high frequency to low frequency</p>
<p>and everything in between</p>
<p>is organized in a very systematic way.</p>
<p>Now, our experience of life from the time we&rsquo;re a baby</p>
<p>until the time that we die is not systematic.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t hear low frequencies at one part of the room</p>
<p>or at one part of the day</p>
<p>and high frequencies at another part of the room</p>
<p>and another part of the day, they&rsquo;re all intermixed.</p>
<p>But if you remember, the cochlea separates them out</p>
<p>just like a prism of light separates out</p>
<p>the different wavelengths of light,</p>
<p>the cochlea separates out the different frequencies.</p>
<p>And the developing brain</p>
<p>takes those separated out frequencies</p>
<p>and learns this relationship between itself,</p>
<p>meaning the child and the outside world.</p>
<p>White noise essentially contains no tonotopic information.</p>
<p>The frequencies are all intermixed, it&rsquo;s just noise.</p>
<p>Whereas when I speak, my voice has,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m getting technical,</p>
<p>but it has what&rsquo;s called a certain envelope,</p>
<p>meaning it has some low frequencies</p>
<p>and some slightly high frequencies.</p>
<p>Like I make my voice higher,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;m not very good at that,</p>
<p>my voice starts to crack and I can make my voice lower,</p>
<p>although not as low as Costello&rsquo;s snore.</p>
<p>So it has an envelope, it has a container.</p>
<p>White noise has no container.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like all the colors of the rainbow</p>
<p>spread out together, which is actually what you get</p>
<p>when you get white light.</p>
<p>White noise is analogous to white light.</p>
<p>So one of the reasons why hearing a lot of white noise</p>
<p>during development for long periods of time</p>
<p>can be detrimental to the development of the auditory system</p>
<p>is that these tonotopic maps don&rsquo;t form normally.</p>
<p>At least they don&rsquo;t in experimental animals.</p>
<p>Now, the reason I&rsquo;m raising this</p>
<p>is that many people I know,</p>
<p>in particular friends who have small children,</p>
<p>they say, I want to use a white noise machine while I sleep.</p>
<p>But is it okay for my baby to use a white noise machine?</p>
<p>And I consulted with various people, scientists about this,</p>
<p>and they said, well, you know,</p>
<p>the baby is also hearing the parents&rsquo; voices</p>
<p>and is hearing music and is hearing the dog bark.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not the only thing they&rsquo;re hearing.</p>
<p>However, every single person that I consulted with said,</p>
<p>but you know, there&rsquo;s neuroplasticity during sleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when the kid is sleeping.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;d want to expose a child</p>
<p>to white noise the entire night</p>
<p>because it might degrade that tonotopic map.</p>
<p>It might not destroy it, it might not eliminate it,</p>
<p>but it could make it a little less clear,</p>
<p>like sort of taking the keys on the piano</p>
<p>and taping a few of them together, right?</p>
<p>So you still got the highs and lows</p>
<p>in the appropriate order and everything in between,</p>
<p>but when you tape the keys together,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get the same fidelity.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get the same precision of the noise</p>
<p>that comes out of that piano.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t, again, I don&rsquo;t want to scare anybody,</p>
<p>but I would say if you are in a position</p>
<p>to make the choice of either using white noise</p>
<p>or something similar,</p>
<p>pink noise is just a kind of variation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a little bit more of a certain frequency,</p>
<p>just like pink light has a little bit more</p>
<p>of a certain wavelength than white light.</p>
<p>If you are in a position to make choices</p>
<p>about things to put in a young,</p>
<p>especially very young child&rsquo;s sleeping environment,</p>
<p>white noise might be something to consider avoiding.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not telling you what to do,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something to perhaps consider avoiding.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think most pediatricians</p>
<p>are going to be aware of these data,</p>
<p>but if you talk to any auditory physiologist</p>
<p>or an audiologist or somebody</p>
<p>who studies auditory development,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fairly certain that they would have opinions about that.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not their opinions agree with mine</p>
<p>and these folks that I consulted with or not</p>
<p>is a separate matter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know because I don&rsquo;t know them,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something that I felt was important enough</p>
<p>to cue you to,</p>
<p>especially since I&rsquo;ve highlighted, excuse me,</p>
<p>the opposite effect is true in adulthood.</p>
<p>Once your auditory system has formed,</p>
<p>once it&rsquo;s established these tonotopic maps,</p>
<p>then the presence of background white noise</p>
<p>should not be a problem at all.</p>
<p>In fact, it shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem at all</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re also not attending to it.</p>
<p>The idea is that it&rsquo;s playing at a low enough volume</p>
<p>that you kind of forget it in the background</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s supporting learning</p>
<p>by bringing your brain into a heightened state</p>
<p>of alertness and especially this heightened state</p>
<p>of dopamine, dopaminergic activation of the brain,</p>
<p>which will make it easier to learn faster</p>
<p>and easier to learn the information.</p>
<p>So now I want to talk about auditory learning</p>
<p>and actually how you can get better</p>
<p>at learning information that you hear,</p>
<p>not just information that you see on a page</p>
<p>or motor skill learning.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons to want to do this.</p>
<p>A lot of classroom teaching,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s by Zoom or in person,</p>
<p>is auditory in nature.</p>
<p>Not everything is necessarily written down for us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also good to get better at listening, or so I&rsquo;m told.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a phenomenon called the cocktail party effect.</p>
<p>Now, even if you&rsquo;ve never been to a cocktail party,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve experienced and participated</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s called the cocktail party effect.</p>
<p>The cocktail party effect is where you are</p>
<p>in an environment that&rsquo;s rich with sound,</p>
<p>many sound waves coming from many different sources,</p>
<p>many different things.</p>
<p>So in a city, in a classroom,</p>
<p>in a car that contains people having various conversations,</p>
<p>you somehow need to be able to attend</p>
<p>to specific components of those sound waves,</p>
<p>meaning you need to hear certain people and not others.</p>
<p>The reason it&rsquo;s called the cocktail party effect</p>
<p>is that you, meaning your brain,</p>
<p>are exquisitely good at creating a cone</p>
<p>of auditory attention, a narrow band of attention</p>
<p>with which you can extract the information you care about</p>
<p>and wipe away or erase all the rest.</p>
<p>Now, this takes work.</p>
<p>It takes attention.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why you might come home</p>
<p>from a loud gathering, maybe a stadium, a sports event,</p>
<p>or a cocktail party for that matter,</p>
<p>and feel just exhausted is because</p>
<p>if you are listening to conversations there</p>
<p>or trying to listen to those conversations</p>
<p>while watching the game and people moving past you</p>
<p>and hearing all this noise, clinking of glasses, et cetera,</p>
<p>it takes attentional effort</p>
<p>and the brain uses up a lot of energy just at rest,</p>
<p>but it uses up even more energy</p>
<p>when you are paying strong attention to something,</p>
<p>literally caloric energy,</p>
<p>burning up things like glucose, et cetera.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re ketogenic, it&rsquo;s burning up energy.</p>
<p>So the cocktail party effect has been studied extensively</p>
<p>in the field of neuroscience.</p>
<p>And we now know at a mechanistic level</p>
<p>how one accomplishes this feat</p>
<p>of attending to certain sounds,</p>
<p>despite the fact that we are being bombarded</p>
<p>with all sorts of other sounds.</p>
<p>So there are a couple of ways that we do this.</p>
<p>First of all, much as with our visual system,</p>
<p>we can expand or contract our visual field of view</p>
<p>so we can go from panoramic vision,</p>
<p>see the entire scene that we are in by dilating our gaze.</p>
<p>Talked a lot about this on this podcast and elsewhere.</p>
<p>We can, for instance, keep our head and eyes stationary</p>
<p>or mostly stationary.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be rigid about it.</p>
<p>And you can expand your field of view</p>
<p>so you can see the walls and ceiling and floor,</p>
<p>can see yourself in the environment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s panoramic view.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what you would accomplish without having to try at all</p>
<p>if you went to a horizon, for instance.</p>
<p>Or we can contract our field of view.</p>
<p>I can bring my focus to a particular location,</p>
<p>what we call a vergence point, directly in front of me.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m pointing at the camera directly in front of me.</p>
<p>Okay, we can do that.</p>
<p>We can expand and contract our visual field of view.</p>
<p>Well, we can expand and contract our auditory field of view,</p>
<p>so to speak, or our auditory window.</p>
<p>You can try this next time you are in an environment</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s rich with noise, meaning lots of different sounds.</p>
<p>You can just tune out all the noise to a background chatter.</p>
<p>You kind of just, you try not focus</p>
<p>on any one particular sound</p>
<p>and you get the background kind of chatter of noise.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll find that&rsquo;s actually very relaxing</p>
<p>in comparison to trying to listen to somebody</p>
<p>at a cocktail party and you&rsquo;re shouting back and forth.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re very, very interested in that person</p>
<p>or getting to know them better or what they&rsquo;re telling you</p>
<p>or some combination of those things,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll be very motivated to do it,</p>
<p>but nonetheless it requires energy and effort and attention.</p>
<p>How do we do this?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s actually quite simple,</p>
<p>or at least it&rsquo;s simple in essence,</p>
<p>although the underlying mechanisms are complex.</p>
<p>Here I have to credit the laboratory</p>
<p>of a guy named Mike Weir, W-E-H-R,</p>
<p>up at the University of Oregon,</p>
<p>who essentially figured out that we are able</p>
<p>to accomplish this extraction of particular sounds.</p>
<p>We can really hear one person or a small number of people</p>
<p>amidst a huge background of chatter</p>
<p>because we pay attention to the onset of words,</p>
<p>but also to the offset of words.</p>
<p>Now, the way to visualize this is if the background noise</p>
<p>is just like a bunch of waves of noise,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s literally just sound waves coming,</p>
<p>every frequency, low frequency, high frequency,</p>
<p>glasses clinking together.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re at a game, people are shouting,</p>
<p>people are talking on their phone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the crack of the ball if somebody</p>
<p>actually manages to hit the ball,</p>
<p>the announcer, et cetera.</p>
<p>But whatever we&rsquo;re paying attention to,</p>
<p>we set up a cone of auditory attention,</p>
<p>a kind of a tunnel of auditory attention</p>
<p>where we are listening, although we don&rsquo;t realize it,</p>
<p>we are listening for the onset</p>
<p>and the offset of those words.</p>
<p>Now, this is powerful for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s a call to arms, so to speak,</p>
<p>to disengage your auditory system</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t need to focus your attention</p>
<p>on something particular.</p>
<p>So if you are somebody, you&rsquo;re coming home from work,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve had a very long day and you&rsquo;re trying to make out</p>
<p>a particular conversation on background noise,</p>
<p>you might consider just not having that conversation,</p>
<p>just letting your auditory landscape be very broad,</p>
<p>almost like panoramic vision.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to learn how to extract sound information,</p>
<p>it could be notes of music, it could be scales of music,</p>
<p>it could be words spoken by somebody else.</p>
<p>Maybe somebody is telling you what you need to say</p>
<p>for a particular speech or the information</p>
<p>that you need to learn for a particular topic</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re telling it to you.</p>
<p>Deliberately paying attention both to the onset</p>
<p>and to the offset of those words can be beneficial</p>
<p>because it is exactly the way that the auditory system</p>
<p>likes to bring in information.</p>
<p>So one of the more common phenomena</p>
<p>that I think we all experience</p>
<p>is you go to a party and, or you meet somebody new</p>
<p>and you say, hi, I would say, hi, I&rsquo;m Andrew.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;d say, hi, I&rsquo;m Jeff, for instance.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re great, great to meet you.</p>
<p>And then a minute later, I can&rsquo;t remember the guy&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>Now, is it because I don&rsquo;t care what his name is?</p>
<p>No, somehow the presence of other auditory information</p>
<p>interfered, it&rsquo;s not that my mind</p>
<p>was necessarily someplace else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that the signal to noise, as we say, wasn&rsquo;t high enough.</p>
<p>Somehow the way he said it</p>
<p>or the way it landed on my ears,</p>
<p>which is really all that matters, right?</p>
<p>When it comes down to learning is such</p>
<p>that it just didn&rsquo;t achieve high enough signal to noise.</p>
<p>The noise was too high or the signal was too low</p>
<p>or some combination of those.</p>
<p>So the next time you ask somebody&rsquo;s name,</p>
<p>remember, listen to the onset of what they say</p>
<p>and the offsets.</p>
<p>It would be paying attention to the je in Jeff</p>
<p>and it would be paying attention to the th in F,</p>
<p>in Jeff, excuse me, all right?</p>
<p>And chances are, you&rsquo;ll be able to remember that name.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know if people who are super learners</p>
<p>of names do this naturally or not.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have access to their brains.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re going to give me access</p>
<p>to their brains either.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a very interesting way to take the natural biology</p>
<p>of auditory attention and learning and apply it</p>
<p>to scenarios where you&rsquo;re trying to remember</p>
<p>either people&rsquo;s names or specific information.</p>
<p>Now, I do acknowledge that trying to learn every word</p>
<p>in a sentence by paying attention to its onset and offset</p>
<p>could actually be kind of disruptive</p>
<p>to the learning process.</p>
<p>So this would be more for specific attention.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re asking directions in a city and somebody says,</p>
<p>okay, you say you&rsquo;re lost and they say,</p>
<p>okay, you&rsquo;re going to go two blocks down,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to turn left,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re going to see a landmark on your right,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re going to go in the third door on your left.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of information, at least for me, okay?</p>
<p>So the way you would want to listen to that</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re going to go down the road.</p>
<p>See, I already forgot.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to go left and you&rsquo;re just going to program.</p>
<p>And instead of just hearing the word left,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to think the L at the front of left and the T.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to left, okay?</p>
<p>And then, so you&rsquo;re coding in specific words.</p>
<p>And what this does is this kind of hijacks</p>
<p>these naturally occurring attention mechanisms</p>
<p>that the auditory system likes to use.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit of data that for auditory encoding,</p>
<p>this kind of thing can be beneficial.</p>
<p>There are a lot of data</p>
<p>that attention for auditory coding is beneficial.</p>
<p>There are a little bit of data</p>
<p>showing that deliberately encoding auditory information</p>
<p>this way, meaning trying to learn</p>
<p>auditory information this way can be beneficial</p>
<p>or can accelerate learning.</p>
<p>And some of these features of what I&rsquo;m describing here</p>
<p>map onto some of the work of Mike Merzenich</p>
<p>and others that have been designed</p>
<p>to try and overcome things like stutter</p>
<p>and to treat various forms of auditory learning disorders.</p>
<p>But more importantly, and perhaps more powerful</p>
<p>is the work of Mike Merzenich</p>
<p>that was done with his then graduate student,</p>
<p>Greg Rechenzone, that showed that</p>
<p>using the attentional system,</p>
<p>we can actually learn much faster</p>
<p>and we can actually activate neuroplasticity</p>
<p>in the adult brain,</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s very challenging to do.</p>
<p>And that the auditory system is one of the main ways</p>
<p>in which we can access neuroplasticity more broadly.</p>
<p>So I just want to take a couple of minutes</p>
<p>and describe the work of Rechenzone and Merzenich</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s absolutely fantastic and fascinating.</p>
<p>What they did is they had subjects</p>
<p>try to learn auditory information,</p>
<p>except that they told them to pay attention</p>
<p>to particular frequencies.</p>
<p>So now you know what frequencies are.</p>
<p>So essentially high-pitched sounds or low-pitched sounds.</p>
<p>What they found was just passively listening</p>
<p>to a bunch of stuff does not allow the brain to change</p>
<p>and for that stuff to be remembered at all.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a surprise.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all experienced the phenomenon</p>
<p>of having someone talk</p>
<p>and we see their mouth moving and we&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>yeah, this is really important, this is really important.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re listening, we&rsquo;re trying to listen</p>
<p>and then they walk away and we think,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get any of that.</p>
<p>And you wonder whether or not it was them.</p>
<p>Maybe this is happening to you right now.</p>
<p>You wonder whether or not it was you.</p>
<p>You wonder whether or not you have trouble with learning</p>
<p>or you have attention deficit.</p>
<p>It could be any number of different things.</p>
<p>But what Rechenzone and Merzenich discovered</p>
<p>was that if you instruct subjects to listen</p>
<p>for particular cues within speech or within sounds,</p>
<p>that not only can you learn those things more quickly,</p>
<p>but that you can remap these tonotopic maps in the cortex</p>
<p>that I referred to earlier.</p>
<p>You actually get changes in the neural architecture,</p>
<p>the neural circuitry in the brain.</p>
<p>And this can occur not only very rapidly,</p>
<p>but they can occur in the adult brain,</p>
<p>which prior to their work</p>
<p>was not thought to be amenable to change.</p>
<p>It was long thought that neuroplasticity</p>
<p>could only occur in the developing brain,</p>
<p>but the work of Rechenzone and Merzenich</p>
<p>in the auditory system actually was some of the first</p>
<p>that really opened up everybody&rsquo;s eyes and ears</p>
<p>to the idea that the brain can change in adulthood.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s how this sort of process would work</p>
<p>and how you might apply it.</p>
<p>If you are trying to learn music</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re trying to learn information</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to then recite,</p>
<p>you can decide to highlight certain words</p>
<p>or certain frequencies of sound</p>
<p>or certain scales or certain keys on the piano</p>
<p>and to only focus on those for certain learning bouts, okay?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll give an example that&rsquo;s sort of real time for me,</p>
<p>meaning it&rsquo;s happening right now.</p>
<p>I know generally what I want to say when I arrive here.</p>
<p>I even know specifically certain things</p>
<p>that I want to make sure get across to you.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think about every single word</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m going to say and the precise order</p>
<p>in which I&rsquo;m going to say those things.</p>
<p>That would be actually very disruptive</p>
<p>because it wouldn&rsquo;t match my normal patterns of speech</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d probably think I was sounding rather robotic</p>
<p>if I were to do that.</p>
<p>So one way that we can remember information</p>
<p>is as we write out, for instance,</p>
<p>something that we want to say,</p>
<p>we can highlight particular words, we can underline those.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re listening to somebody</p>
<p>and they are telling us information,</p>
<p>we can decide just to highlight particular words</p>
<p>that they said to us and write those down.</p>
<p>Now, of course, we&rsquo;re listening to all the information,</p>
<p>but the work of Rechenzon and Merzenich</p>
<p>and the work of others, in addition to them,</p>
<p>his former student or former postdoc, I don&rsquo;t know which,</p>
<p>Michael Kilgard, who&rsquo;s now got his own lab down in Texas,</p>
<p>or others, have shown that the cuing of attention</p>
<p>to particular features of speech,</p>
<p>particular components of speech,</p>
<p>the way in which it increases our level of attention</p>
<p>overall allows us to capture more</p>
<p>of the information overall.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t want this to be abstract at all.</p>
<p>What this means is when you&rsquo;re listening,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to listen to every word.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re already listening to every word,</p>
<p>all the information&rsquo;s coming in through your ears.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re trying to extract is particular things</p>
<p>or themes within the content.</p>
<p>So maybe you decide, if you&rsquo;re listening to me,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re only going to listen to the word tools</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re only going to listen to when my voice</p>
<p>kind of goes above background.</p>
<p>You get to decide what you decide to listen to or not.</p>
<p>And what you decide to focus on</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t necessarily as important</p>
<p>as the fact that you&rsquo;re focusing.</p>
<p>So I hope that&rsquo;s clear.</p>
<p>The auditory system does this all the time</p>
<p>with the cocktail party effect.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m talking about is exporting certain elements</p>
<p>of the mechanisms of the cocktail party effect,</p>
<p>paying attention to the onset and offset of words</p>
<p>or particular notes within music or particular scales,</p>
<p>or you can make it even broader</p>
<p>and particular motifs of music</p>
<p>or particular sentences of words or particular phrases.</p>
<p>And in doing that, you extract more</p>
<p>of the information overall,</p>
<p>even though you&rsquo;re not paying attention</p>
<p>to all the information at once.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to talk about a phenomenon</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve all experienced before,</p>
<p>which is called Doppler.</p>
<p>So the Doppler effect is the way that we experience sound</p>
<p>when the thing that&rsquo;s making that sound is moving.</p>
<p>The simplest way to explain this</p>
<p>is to translate the sound into the visual world once again.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve ever seen a duck or a goose</p>
<p>sitting in a pond or a lake,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of bobbing up and down,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll notice is that the ripples of water</p>
<p>that extend out from that duck or goose</p>
<p>are fairly regularly spaced in all directions.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because that duck or goose is stationary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s moving up and down,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not moving forward or backward or to the side.</p>
<p>Now, if that duck or goose were to swim forward</p>
<p>by paddling its little webbed feet under the surface,</p>
<p>you would immediately notice that the ripples of water</p>
<p>that are close to and in front of that duck or goose</p>
<p>would be closer together</p>
<p>than the ones that trailed it, that were behind.</p>
<p>And that is essentially what happens with sound as well.</p>
<p>With the Doppler effect,</p>
<p>we experience sounds that are closer to us</p>
<p>at higher frequency.</p>
<p>The ripples are closer together.</p>
<p>And sounds that are further away at lower frequency,</p>
<p>especially when they&rsquo;re moving past us.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve ever, for instance,</p>
<p>heard a siren in the distance.</p>
<p>Nanana, nanana, nanana, nanana, nanana, nanana, nanana.</p>
<p>Nanana, nanana, nanana, nanana, nanana, nanana, nanana.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s essentially my rendition of a siren.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what ambulance or police or what,</p>
<p>passing you on a street.</p>
<p>That is the Doppler effect.</p>
<p>The Doppler effect is one of the main ways</p>
<p>that we make out the direction that things are arriving from</p>
<p>and their speeds and trajectories.</p>
<p>And we get very good from a very young age</p>
<p>at discerning what direction things are arriving from</p>
<p>and the direction that they are going to pass us in.</p>
<p>And the Doppler effect has probably saved your life</p>
<p>many, many times.</p>
<p>In this way, you just don&rsquo;t realize it</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ll step off the curb</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re driving your car and you pull to the side</p>
<p>so that the ambulance or fire truck can go by</p>
<p>because you heard that siren off in the distance.</p>
<p>And then you pull away from the curb</p>
<p>and you get back on the road,</p>
<p>in part because you don&rsquo;t see it any longer,</p>
<p>but also you don&rsquo;t hear any other sirens in the distance.</p>
<p>Now, some animals such as bats are exquisitely good</p>
<p>at navigating their environments according to sound.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;ve all heard that bats don&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually not true.</p>
<p>They actually have vision,</p>
<p>but they just rely more heavily on their auditory system.</p>
<p>And the way that bats navigate in the dark</p>
<p>and the way that bats navigate using sound</p>
<p>is through Doppler.</p>
<p>Now, they don&rsquo;t simply listen</p>
<p>to whether or not things are coming at them</p>
<p>or moving away from them and pay attention to Doppler</p>
<p>like the siren example I gave for you.</p>
<p>What they do is they generate their own sounds.</p>
<p>So a bat, as it flies around, is sending out clicks.</p>
<p>Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s my best bat sound, or maybe it&rsquo;s click,</p>
<p>click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re clicking.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually propelling sound out</p>
<p>at a particular frequency that they know.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not they&rsquo;re conscious of it, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never asked them.</p>
<p>And if I did ask them, I don&rsquo;t think they could answer.</p>
<p>And if they could answer,</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t answer in a language that I could understand.</p>
<p>But the bat is essentially flying around,</p>
<p>sending out sound waves,</p>
<p>pinging its environment with sound waves</p>
<p>of a particular frequency.</p>
<p>And then depending on the frequency of sound waves</p>
<p>that come back,</p>
<p>they know if they&rsquo;re getting closer to an object</p>
<p>or further away from it.</p>
<p>So if they send out sounds at a frequency of,</p>
<p>this was much slower than it would actually occur,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say one every half second,</p>
<p>rr-rr-rr-rr-rr-rr-rr-rrr.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s coming back even faster,</p>
<p>rr-rr-rr-rr-rr-rr-rr-rr-rr-rr.</p>
<p>Then they know they&rsquo;re getting closer,</p>
<p>because of the Doppler effect.</p>
<p>And if that comes back more slowly,</p>
<p>they know that there&rsquo;s nothing in front of them.</p>
<p>So the bat is essentially navigating its world</p>
<p>by creating these auras of sound</p>
<p>that bounce back onto them</p>
<p>from the various objects, trees, et cetera,</p>
<p>buildings, and people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of eerie to think about,</p>
<p>but yes, they see you with,</p>
<p>they experience you with their sound, they sense you.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re using Doppler to accomplish it.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to talk about ringing in the ears.</p>
<p>This is something that I get asked about a lot.</p>
<p>And speaking of signal to noise,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I get asked about it a lot</p>
<p>because many people suffer from ringing in their ears</p>
<p>or because the people who suffer from ringing in their ears</p>
<p>suffer so much that they are more prone to ask.</p>
<p>So it could be a sampling bias, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been asked enough times</p>
<p>and some of the experiences of discomfort</p>
<p>that people have expressed</p>
<p>about having this ringing of the ears</p>
<p>really motivated me to go deep into this literature.</p>
<p>So the ringing of the ears that one experiences</p>
<p>is called tinnitus, not tinnitus, but tinnitus.</p>
<p>And tinnitus can vary in intensity</p>
<p>and it can vary according to stress levels.</p>
<p>It can vary across the lifespan or even time of day.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very subject to kind of background effects</p>
<p>and contextual effects.</p>
<p>So I think we all know that we should do our best</p>
<p>to maximize healthy sleep.</p>
<p>We did a number of episodes on that.</p>
<p>Essentially the first four episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast were all about sleep</p>
<p>and how to get better sleep.</p>
<p>We all know that we should try and limit our stress.</p>
<p>And we had an episode about stress</p>
<p>and ways to mitigate stress as well.</p>
<p>However, there are people, it seems,</p>
<p>that are suffering from tinnitus</p>
<p>for which stress or lack of sleep</p>
<p>just can&rsquo;t explain the presence of the tinnitus.</p>
<p>Tinnitus can be caused by disruption to these hair cells</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier or damage to the hair cells.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another reason why,</p>
<p>even if you have good hearing now,</p>
<p>that you want to protect that hearing</p>
<p>and really avoid putting yourself</p>
<p>into these kind of two-hit environments,</p>
<p>environments where there&rsquo;s a lot of background noise</p>
<p>and then you add another really loud auditory stimulus.</p>
<p>This also can happen at different times, I should mention.</p>
<p>If you go to a concert</p>
<p>or you listen to loud music with your headphones</p>
<p>and then you go to a concert</p>
<p>or you go into a very loud work environment,</p>
<p>the hair cells can still be vulnerable.</p>
<p>And once those hair cells are knocked out,</p>
<p>currently we don&rsquo;t have the technology to put them back,</p>
<p>although many groups,</p>
<p>including some excellent groups at Stanford and elsewhere,</p>
<p>too, of course, are working on ways</p>
<p>to replenish those hair cells and restore hearing.</p>
<p>There are treatments for tinnitus</p>
<p>that involve taking certain substances.</p>
<p>There are medications for tinnitus.</p>
<p>In the non-prescription landscape,</p>
<p>which is typically what we discuss on this podcast</p>
<p>when we discuss taking anything,</p>
<p>there are essentially four compounds</p>
<p>for which there are quality peer-reviewed data</p>
<p>where there does not appear to be any overt commercial bias,</p>
<p>meaning that nothing&rsquo;s reported in the papers</p>
<p>as funding from a particular company.</p>
<p>And those are melatonin, ginkgo bilboa, zinc, and magnesium.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve talked about melatonin before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m personally not a fan of melatonin as a sleep aid,</p>
<p>but there are four studies.</p>
<p>First one entitled,</p>
<p>The Effects of Melatonin on Tinnitus and Sleep.</p>
<p>Second one, Treatment of Sensual and Sensory Neural Tinnitus</p>
<p>with Orally Administered Melatonin.</p>
<p>And then the title goes on much longer,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a randomized study.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to read out all of these.</p>
<p>Melatonin, Can It Stop the Ringing?</p>
<p>Which is an interesting article, double-blinded study.</p>
<p>And The Effects of Melatonin on Tinnitus.</p>
<p>Each one of these studies has anywhere from 30</p>
<p>to more than 100 subjects, in one case, 102 subjects,</p>
<p>both genders, as they list them out.</p>
<p>Typically, it&rsquo;s listed as sex, not gender in studies,</p>
<p>so it should say both sexes, but nonetheless.</p>
<p>And age range anywhere from 30 years old</p>
<p>all the way up to 65 plus.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see any studies of people younger than 30.</p>
<p>All three focused on melatonin,</p>
<p>not surprisingly because of the titles.</p>
<p>Looking at a range of dosages,</p>
<p>anywhere from three milligrams per day,</p>
<p>which is sort of typical of many supplements for melatonin,</p>
<p>still much higher than one would manufacture endogenously</p>
<p>through your own pineal gland.</p>
<p>But three milligrams in these studies</p>
<p>for a duration of anywhere from 30 days</p>
<p>to much longer in some cases, six months.</p>
<p>And all four of these studies found modest,</p>
<p>yet still statistically significant effects</p>
<p>of taking melatonin by mouth,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s orally administered melatonin,</p>
<p>in reducing the severity of tinnitus.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s compelling, at least to me.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t sound like a cure.</p>
<p>And of course, as always, I&rsquo;m not a physician.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a scientist, so I don&rsquo;t prescribe anything.</p>
<p>I only profess things.</p>
<p>I report to you the science.</p>
<p>You have to decide if melatonin is right for you</p>
<p>if you have tinnitus.</p>
<p>And certainly I say that both to protect myself,</p>
<p>but also protect you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re responsible for your health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not telling anyone to run out</p>
<p>and start taking melatonin for tinnitus,</p>
<p>but it does seem that it can have some effects</p>
<p>in reducing its symptoms.</p>
<p>Ginkgo-Boa-Boa is an interesting compound.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been prescribed for or recommended</p>
<p>for many, many things.</p>
<p>But there are a few studies, again,</p>
<p>double-blinded studies lasting one to six months,</p>
<p>one that has an impressive number of subjects,</p>
<p>978 subjects ranging from age 18 all the way up to 65,</p>
<p>so on and so forth,</p>
<p>that show not huge effects of ginkgo,</p>
<p>but as they quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Limited evidence suggests that if tinnitus</p>
<p>is a side effect of something else,</p>
<p>in particular cognitive decline,</p>
<p>so age-related tinnitus might be helped by ginkgo-Boa-Boa.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t go through all the details of the zinc studies,</p>
<p>but it seems that zinc supplementation at higher levels</p>
<p>than are typical of most people&rsquo;s intakes,</p>
<p>so 50 milligrams per day,</p>
<p>do appear to be able to reduce subjective symptoms</p>
<p>of tinnitus in most of the people</p>
<p>that took the supplemented zinc.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t a lot of studies on that,</p>
<p>so I could only find one double-blinded study.</p>
<p>It lasted anywhere from one to six months, 41 subjects,</p>
<p>both genders listed out again here, 45 to 64,</p>
<p>and they saw a decrease in the severity of tinnitus symptoms</p>
<p>with 50 milligrams of elemental zinc supplementation.</p>
<p>And then last but not least is the magnesium study.</p>
<p>Again, only a single study.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a phase two study,</p>
<p>looking at a fairly limited number of subjects,</p>
<p>so only 19 subjects,</p>
<p>taking 532 milligrams of elemental magnesium.</p>
<p>For those of you that take magnesium,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s magnesium and elemental magnesium,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s always translated on the bottle,</p>
<p>but it was associated with a lessening of symptoms</p>
<p>related to tinnitus.</p>
<p>So for you tinnitus sufferers out there,</p>
<p>you may already be aware of this.</p>
<p>You may already be taking these things</p>
<p>and had no positive effects,</p>
<p>meaning they didn&rsquo;t help, maybe not.</p>
<p>I hope that you&rsquo;ll at least consider these,</p>
<p>talk to your doctor about them.</p>
<p>I do realize that tinnitus is extremely disruptive.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say I empathize because I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>from a place of experience, that is,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t have tinnitus,</p>
<p>but for those of you that don&rsquo;t, including myself,</p>
<p>you can imagine that hearing sounds</p>
<p>of things that aren&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>and the ringing in one&rsquo;s ears can be very disruptive,</p>
<p>and I think would be very disruptive,</p>
<p>and it explains why people with tinnitus</p>
<p>reach out so often with questions</p>
<p>about how to alleviate that,</p>
<p>and I hope this information was useful to you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to now talk about balance</p>
<p>and our sense of balance,</p>
<p>which is controlled by, believe it or not,</p>
<p>our ears and things in our ears,</p>
<p>as well as by our brain and elements of our spinal cord.</p>
<p>But before I do that, I want to ask you another question,</p>
<p>or I would rather I&rsquo;d like to ask you</p>
<p>to ask yourself a question and answer it,</p>
<p>which is, how big are your ears?</p>
<p>Turns out that the ears grow our entire life.</p>
<p>In the early stage of our life, they grow more slowly,</p>
<p>and then as we age, they grow more quickly.</p>
<p>You may have noticed if you have family members</p>
<p>who are well into their 70s and 80s,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re fortunate and you&rsquo;re into their 90s</p>
<p>and maybe even 100s,</p>
<p>is that the ears of some of these individuals</p>
<p>get very, very big relative to their previous ear sizes.</p>
<p>It turns out that biological age</p>
<p>can actually be measured according to ear size.</p>
<p>Now, you have to take a few measurements,</p>
<p>but believe it or not,</p>
<p>there is a formula in the scientific literature.</p>
<p>If you know your ear circumference,</p>
<p>so the distance around your ear, ears, plural,</p>
<p>presumably you have two, most people do, in millimeters.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to take the circumference</p>
<p>of your ears in millimeters.</p>
<p>How would you do this, right?</p>
<p>How would you do this?</p>
<p>Maybe you take a string and you put it around your ear,</p>
<p>and then you measure the string.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably going to be easier</p>
<p>than marching around your ear</p>
<p>or somebody else&rsquo;s ear with a ruler</p>
<p>and measuring in millimeters.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your ear circumference?</p>
<p>On the outside, don&rsquo;t go in on the divot or anything,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just going around</p>
<p>as if you were going to trace the closest fitting oval,</p>
<p>assuming your ears are oval,</p>
<p>closest fitting oval that matches your ear circumference.</p>
<p>Take that number in millimeters, subtract from it.</p>
<p>Oh, excuse me, I should do this correctly.</p>
<p>Do that for both ears, add them together,</p>
<p>add those numbers together, divide by two,</p>
<p>get the average for your two ears,</p>
<p>get your average ear circumference</p>
<p>for across your two ears.</p>
<p>Then take that number in millimeters, subtract 88.1,</p>
<p>and then whatever value that is,</p>
<p>multiply it times 1.96,</p>
<p>and that will tell you your biological age.</p>
<p>Now, why in the world would this be accurate?</p>
<p>Well, as we age,</p>
<p>there are changes in number of different biological pathways.</p>
<p>One of those pathways is the pathways</p>
<p>related to collagen synthesis.</p>
<p>So not only are our ears growing,</p>
<p>but our noses are growing too.</p>
<p>My nose seems to be growing a lot,</p>
<p>but then again, I did sports where I would get my nose</p>
<p>broken, something I don&rsquo;t recommend.</p>
<p>So I always point out,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get a nose like mine doing yoga.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, my nose is still growing</p>
<p>and my ears are still growing,</p>
<p>and I suspect as I get older,</p>
<p>if I have the good fortune of living into my 80s and 90s,</p>
<p>my ears are going to continue to grow.</p>
<p>A comparison between chronological age and biological age</p>
<p>is something that&rsquo;s of really deep interest these days.</p>
<p>And the work of David Sinclair</p>
<p>at Harvard Medical School and others,</p>
<p>so-called Horvath clocks that people have developed,</p>
<p>have tapped into how the epigenome and the genome</p>
<p>can give us some insight into our biological age</p>
<p>and how that compares to our chronological age.</p>
<p>Most of us know our chronological age</p>
<p>because we know when we were born</p>
<p>and we know where we are relative to that now.</p>
<p>But you can start to make a little chart, if you like,</p>
<p>about your rates of ear growth.</p>
<p>Your rates of ear growth actually correlate pretty well</p>
<p>with your rates of biological progression</p>
<p>through this thing that we call life.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not something that we think about too often,</p>
<p>but just like our DNA and our epigenome</p>
<p>and some other markers of metabolic health</p>
<p>and hormone health relate to our age,</p>
<p>so does our collagen synthesis.</p>
<p>And one of the places that shows up the most</p>
<p>is in these two little goodies on the sides of our heads,</p>
<p>which are our ears.</p>
<p>So even though it&rsquo;s a little bit of a bizarre metric,</p>
<p>it makes perfect sense in the biological context.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about balance</p>
<p>and how to get better at balancing.</p>
<p>The reason why we&rsquo;re talking about balance</p>
<p>and how to get better at balancing</p>
<p>in the episode about hearing</p>
<p>is that all the goodies that are going to allow you</p>
<p>to do that are in your ears.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also in your brain,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re mostly in your ears.</p>
<p>So as you recall from the beginning of this episode,</p>
<p>you have two cochlea, cochleas,</p>
<p>that are one on each side of your head,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a little spiral snail-shaped thing</p>
<p>that converts sound waves into electrical signals</p>
<p>that the rest of your brain can understand.</p>
<p>Right next to those,</p>
<p>you have what are called semicircular canals.</p>
<p>The semicircular canals can be best visualized</p>
<p>as thinking about three hula hoops with marbles in them.</p>
<p>So imagine that you have a hula hoop,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not filled with marbles all the way around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just got some marbles down there at the base, okay?</p>
<p>So if you were to move that hula hoop around,</p>
<p>the marbles will move around.</p>
<p>Shoo, shoo, shoo, okay?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got three of those,</p>
<p>and each one of those hula hoops</p>
<p>has these marbles that can move around.</p>
<p>One of those hula hoops is positioned vertically</p>
<p>with respect to gravity.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically parallel to your nose.</p>
<p>It sits like this if you&rsquo;re watching on a video,</p>
<p>but basically it&rsquo;s upright.</p>
<p>Another one of those hula hoops</p>
<p>is basically at a 90-degree angle to your nose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically parallel to the floor</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re standing upright now, if you&rsquo;re seated, okay?</p>
<p>And the other one is kind of tilted</p>
<p>about 45 degrees in between those.</p>
<p>Now, why is the system there?</p>
<p>Well, those marbles within each one of those hula hoops</p>
<p>can move around, but they&rsquo;ll only move around</p>
<p>if your head moves in a particular way.</p>
<p>And there are three planes or three ways</p>
<p>that your head can move.</p>
<p>Your head can move up and down,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m nodding right now, so that&rsquo;s called pitch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pitching forward or pitching back, okay?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a nod up and down.</p>
<p>Or I can shake my head no, side to side.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called yaw.</p>
<p>You pilots will be very familiar with this, yaw.</p>
<p>Not yawn, yaw.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s roll, tilting the head from side to side,</p>
<p>the way that a cute puppy might look at you</p>
<p>from side to side, okay?</p>
<p>Or if somebody doesn&rsquo;t really understand</p>
<p>or believe what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>they might tilt their head, very common phenomenon.</p>
<p>I mean, no one does that to me,</p>
<p>but they do that to each other.</p>
<p>So pitch, yaw, and roll are the movements of the head</p>
<p>in each of the three major planes of motion, as we say.</p>
<p>And each one of those causes those marbles</p>
<p>to move in one or two of the various hula hoops, okay?</p>
<p>So if I move my head up and down when I nod,</p>
<p>one of those hula hoops, literally right now,</p>
<p>the marbles are moving back and forth.</p>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t actually marbles, by the way.</p>
<p>These are little, kind of like little stones, basically,</p>
<p>little calcium-like deposits.</p>
<p>And when they roll back and forth,</p>
<p>they deflect little hairs, little hair cells</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t like the hair cells</p>
<p>that we use for measuring sound waves.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not too different,</p>
<p>but they are different from them.</p>
<p>Not like the hairs on our heads,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re basically rolling past these little hair cells</p>
<p>and causing them to deflect.</p>
<p>And when they deflect downward, the neurons,</p>
<p>because hair cells are neurons,</p>
<p>send information up to the brain.</p>
<p>So if I move my head like this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a physical movement of these little stones</p>
<p>in this hula hoop, as I&rsquo;m referring to it,</p>
<p>but they deflect these hairs,</p>
<p>send those hairs, which are neurons, those hair cells,</p>
<p>send information off to the brain.</p>
<p>If I move my head from side to side,</p>
<p>different little stones move.</p>
<p>If I roll my head, different stones move.</p>
<p>This is an exquisite system</p>
<p>that exists in all animals that have a jaw.</p>
<p>So any fish that has a jaw has this system.</p>
<p>A puppy has this system.</p>
<p>Any animal that has a jaw has this so-called balance system,</p>
<p>which we call the vestibular system.</p>
<p>One of the more important things to know</p>
<p>about the vestibular, the balance system,</p>
<p>is that it works together with the visual system.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I hear something off to my left</p>
<p>and I swing my head over to the left to see what it is.</p>
<p>There are two sources of information</p>
<p>about where my head is relative to my body,</p>
<p>and I need to know that.</p>
<p>First of all, when I quickly move my head to the side,</p>
<p>those little stones, as I&rsquo;m referring to them,</p>
<p>I realize they&rsquo;re not actually stones,</p>
<p>but as I&rsquo;m referring to them,</p>
<p>they quickly activate those hair cells</p>
<p>in that one semicircular canal</p>
<p>and send a signal off to my brain</p>
<p>that my head just moved to the side like this.</p>
<p>Not that it went like this and pitched back</p>
<p>or not that it tilted, but it just moved to the side.</p>
<p>But also visual information slid past my field of view.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have to think about it,</p>
<p>but just slid past my field of view.</p>
<p>And when those two signals combine,</p>
<p>my eyes then lock to a particular location.</p>
<p>Now, if this is at all complicated,</p>
<p>you can actually uncouple these things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to do.</p>
<p>You can do this right now.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;d like you to do this experiment</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not already doing something else</p>
<p>that requires your attention.</p>
<p>And certainly don&rsquo;t do this if you&rsquo;re driving, okay?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to sit down</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to move your head to the left very slowly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going with your eyes open.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to move it very, very slowly.</p>
<p>The whole thing should take about five, six,</p>
<p>maybe even 10 seconds to complete.</p>
<p>Okay, I just did it.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m going to do it very quickly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like you to do it very quickly as well.</p>
<p>Now do it slowly again.</p>
<p>Okay, what you probably noticed</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s very uncomfortable to do it slowly,</p>
<p>but you can do it very quickly</p>
<p>without much discomfort at all.</p>
<p>You just move your head to the side.</p>
<p>The reason is when you move your head very slowly,</p>
<p>those little stones at the base of that hula hoop,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t get enough momentum to move.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re actually not generating</p>
<p>this signal to the brain that your head is moving.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;ll notice is that your eyes have to go,</p>
<p>boom, boom, boom, jumping over step by step.</p>
<p>Whereas if you move your head really quickly,</p>
<p>the signal gets off to your brain</p>
<p>and your eyes just go, boom,</p>
<p>right to the location you want to look at.</p>
<p>So moving your body slowly is actually very disruptive</p>
<p>to the vestibular system.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very disruptive to your visual system.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;ve ever had the misfortune of being on a boat</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going through big oscillations on the boat,</p>
<p>for those of you seasick, folks that get seasick,</p>
<p>this can actually make certain people seasick</p>
<p>just to hear about it.</p>
<p>That was big oscillations going up and down</p>
<p>and up and down.</p>
<p>Those are very disruptive.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about nausea in a minute</p>
<p>and how to offset that kind of nausea.</p>
<p>I get pretty seasick,</p>
<p>but there are ways that you can deal with this.</p>
<p>But this is incredible</p>
<p>because what it means is it&rsquo;s a purely physical system</p>
<p>of these little stones rolling around in there</p>
<p>and directing where your eyes should go, okay?</p>
<p>So you can do this also just by looking up.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just say you&rsquo;re sitting in a chair,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to look up towards the ceiling</p>
<p>and your eyes will just go there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing this eyes open and you look down.</p>
<p>Now try doing it really, really slowly.</p>
<p>Some people even get motion sick doing this,</p>
<p>which if you do, then just stop, okay?</p>
<p>So you can do this also to the side,</p>
<p>although it works best</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re moving your head from side to side</p>
<p>or nodding up and down.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re doing here</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re uncoupling these two mechanisms.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re pulling them apart,</p>
<p>the visual part and the vestibular part,</p>
<p>just to illustrate to you that normally</p>
<p>these mechanisms in your inner ear</p>
<p>tell your eyes where to go,</p>
<p>but as well, your eyes tell your balance system,</p>
<p>your vestibular system, how to function.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like you to do a different experiment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to do it right now,</p>
<p>but basically stand up.</p>
<p>If you get the opportunity,</p>
<p>you can do this safely wherever you are.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to stand up</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to look forward about 10, 12 feet.</p>
<p>You can pick a point on a wall</p>
<p>or you can, you know, anywhere that you like.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re out in public, you know, just do it anyway.</p>
<p>You know, just tell them you&rsquo;re listening</p>
<p>to Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>and someone&rsquo;s telling you to do it.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you don&rsquo;t want to do it, don&rsquo;t do it,</p>
<p>but basically do it.</p>
<p>Stand on one leg and lift up the other leg.</p>
<p>You can bend your knee if you like</p>
<p>and just look off into the distance about 10, 12 feet.</p>
<p>If you can do that, if you can stand on one leg,</p>
<p>now close your eyes.</p>
<p>Chances are you&rsquo;re going to suddenly feel</p>
<p>what scientists call postural sway.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to start swaying around a lot.</p>
<p>It is very hard to balance with your eyes closed.</p>
<p>You might think, well, and if you think about that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, why is that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Why would it be that it&rsquo;s hard to balance</p>
<p>with your eyes closed?</p>
<p>Well, information about the visual world</p>
<p>also feeds back onto this vestibular system.</p>
<p>So the vestibular system informs your vision</p>
<p>and tells you where to move your eyes</p>
<p>and your eyes and their positioning</p>
<p>tell your balance system, your vestibular system,</p>
<p>how it should function.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a really cool way</p>
<p>that you can learn to optimize balance.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to try and do this</p>
<p>by learning to balance with your eyes closed.</p>
<p>What you can do is you can raise one leg</p>
<p>and you can look at a short distance,</p>
<p>maybe off to just the distance that your thumb would be</p>
<p>if you were to reach your arm out in front of you,</p>
<p>although you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to put your thumb</p>
<p>in front of you.</p>
<p>So maybe just about two feet in front of you.</p>
<p>Then while still balancing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to step your vision out a further distance</p>
<p>and then a further distance.</p>
<p>And as far as you can possibly see in the environment</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re going to march it back to you.</p>
<p>Now, what the literature shows</p>
<p>is that this kind of balance training</p>
<p>where you incorporate the visual system</p>
<p>and extending out and then marching back in</p>
<p>to the point at which you direct your visual focus</p>
<p>sends robust information</p>
<p>about the relationship between your visual world</p>
<p>and your balance system.</p>
<p>And of course, the balance system includes</p>
<p>not just these hula hoops, these semicircular canals,</p>
<p>but they communicate with the cerebellum,</p>
<p>this so-called mini brain,</p>
<p>actually means mini brain in the back of your brain,</p>
<p>combines that with visual information</p>
<p>and your map of the body surface.</p>
<p>That pattern of training is very beneficial</p>
<p>for enhancing your ability to balance</p>
<p>because the ability to balance is in part</p>
<p>the activation of particular postural muscles,</p>
<p>but just as much, perhaps even more so,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about being able to adjust those postural muscles,</p>
<p>excuse me, it&rsquo;s about the ability</p>
<p>to adjust those postural muscles</p>
<p>as you experience changes in your visual world.</p>
<p>And one of the most robust ways</p>
<p>that you can engage changes in your visual world</p>
<p>is through your own movement.</p>
<p>And so most people are not trying to balance in place.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just trying to stand there</p>
<p>like a statue on one leg.</p>
<p>Most of what we think about when we think about balance</p>
<p>is for sake of sport or dynamic balance</p>
<p>of being able to break ourselves</p>
<p>and when we&rsquo;re lunging in one particular direction</p>
<p>to stop ourselves, that is,</p>
<p>and then to move in another direction</p>
<p>or for skateboarding or surfing or cycling</p>
<p>or any number of different things, gymnastics.</p>
<p>So the visual system is the primary input</p>
<p>by which you develop balance,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t do it just with the visual system.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m recommending is if you&rsquo;re interested</p>
<p>in cultivating a sense of balance,</p>
<p>understand the relationship</p>
<p>between these semicircular canals.</p>
<p>Understand that they are both driving eye movements</p>
<p>and they are driven by eye movements.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a reciprocal relationship.</p>
<p>And then even just two or three minutes a day</p>
<p>or every once in a while, even three times a week,</p>
<p>maybe five minutes, maybe 10 minutes, you pick.</p>
<p>But if you want to enhance balance,</p>
<p>you have to combine changes in your visual environment</p>
<p>with a static posture, standing on one leg</p>
<p>and shifting your visual environment</p>
<p>or static visual view,</p>
<p>looking at one thing and changing your body posture, okay?</p>
<p>So those two things we now know</p>
<p>from the scientific literature combine</p>
<p>in order to give an enhanced sense of balance.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a really nice paper that was published in 2015</p>
<p>called Effects of Balance Training on Balance Performance.</p>
<p>This was in Healthy Adults.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a systematic review and a meta-analysis.</p>
<p>A meta-analysis is when you combine a lot of literature</p>
<p>from a lot of different papers</p>
<p>and extract the really robust</p>
<p>and the less robust statistical effects.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a really nice paper.</p>
<p>As well, there are some papers out there,</p>
<p>for instance, Comparison of Static Balance</p>
<p>and the Role of Vision in the Elite Athletes.</p>
<p>This is essentially the paper that I&rsquo;ve extracted</p>
<p>most of the information that I just gave you from.</p>
<p>And that paper, and there are some others as well,</p>
<p>but basically I distilled them down</p>
<p>into their core components.</p>
<p>The core components are move your vision around</p>
<p>while staying static still,</p>
<p>but in a balanced position, like standing on one leg.</p>
<p>Could be something more complicated</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re somebody who can do more complicated movements.</p>
<p>Unilateral movements seem to be important.</p>
<p>So standing on one leg as opposed to both, right?</p>
<p>Or trying to generate some tilt</p>
<p>is another way to go about it,</p>
<p>or imbalance, meaning one limb asymmetrically</p>
<p>being activated compared to the other limb.</p>
<p>And then the other way to encourage or to cultivate</p>
<p>and build up this vestibular system</p>
<p>and your sense of balance</p>
<p>actually involves movement itself, acceleration.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to talk about now.</p>
<p>So up until now, I&rsquo;ve been talking about balance</p>
<p>only in the static sense,</p>
<p>like standing on one leg, for instance,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a very artificial situation.</p>
<p>Even though you can train balance that way,</p>
<p>most people who want to enhance their sense of balance</p>
<p>for sport or dance or some other endeavor</p>
<p>want to engage balance in a dynamic way,</p>
<p>meaning moving through lots of different planes of movement,</p>
<p>maybe even sometimes while squatting down low</p>
<p>or jumping and landing or making trajectories</p>
<p>that are different angles.</p>
<p>For that, we need to consider that the vestibular system</p>
<p>also cares about acceleration.</p>
<p>So it cares about head position,</p>
<p>it cares about eye position and where the eyes are</p>
<p>and where you&rsquo;re looking,</p>
<p>but it also cares about what direction you&rsquo;re moving</p>
<p>and how fast.</p>
<p>And one of the best things that you can do</p>
<p>to enhance your sense of balance</p>
<p>is to start to bring together your visual system,</p>
<p>the semicircular canals of the inner ear</p>
<p>and what we call linear acceleration.</p>
<p>So if I move forward in space rigidly upright,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a vastly different situation</p>
<p>than if I&rsquo;m leaning to the side.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to cultivate</p>
<p>a better sense of balance, literally,</p>
<p>within the sense organs and the neurons</p>
<p>and the biology of the brain</p>
<p>is to get into modes where we are accelerating forward,</p>
<p>typically it&rsquo;s forward,</p>
<p>while also tilted with respect to gravity.</p>
<p>Now, this would be the carve on a skateboard</p>
<p>or on a surfboard or a snowboard.</p>
<p>This would be the taking a corner on a bike</p>
<p>while being able to lean safely, of course,</p>
<p>lean into the turn so that your head is actually tilted</p>
<p>with respect to the earth.</p>
<p>So anytime that we are rigidly upright,</p>
<p>we aren&rsquo;t really exercising</p>
<p>the vestibular system and balance.</p>
<p>This is why, you know, you see people in the gym on these,</p>
<p>what are those?</p>
<p>Bouncy balls?</p>
<p>Bouncy ball is the one that the guys roll in the park,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Bouncy balls where they&rsquo;re balancing back and forth.</p>
<p>That won&rsquo;t work the small stabilizing muscles.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m talking about is getting into modes</p>
<p>where you actually tilt the body and the head</p>
<p>with respect to earth.</p>
<p>What I mean is with respect to earth&rsquo;s gravitational pull.</p>
<p>Now, the cerebellum is a very interesting structure</p>
<p>because not only is it involved in balance,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also involved in skill learning</p>
<p>and in generating timing of movements.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating structure deserving of an entire episode</p>
<p>or several episodes all on its own.</p>
<p>But some of the outputs of the cerebellum,</p>
<p>meaning the neurons in the cell cerebellum get inputs,</p>
<p>but they also send information out.</p>
<p>The outputs of the cerebellum are strongly linked</p>
<p>to areas of the brain that release neuromodulators</p>
<p>that make us feel really good,</p>
<p>in particular, serotonin and dopamine.</p>
<p>And this is an early emerging subfield within neuroscience,</p>
<p>but a lot of what are called the non-motor outputs</p>
<p>of the cerebellum have a profound influence,</p>
<p>not just on our ability to learn how to balance better,</p>
<p>but also how we feel overall.</p>
<p>So for you exercisers out there,</p>
<p>I do hope people are getting regular,</p>
<p>healthy amounts of exercise.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about what that means in previous episodes.</p>
<p>So at least 150 minutes a week of endurance work,</p>
<p>some strength training,</p>
<p>a minimum of five sets per body part</p>
<p>to maintain musculature.</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t want to grow muscles,</p>
<p>you want to do that in order to maintain healthy strength</p>
<p>and bones, et cetera.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing that,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re only doing things like curls in the gym,</p>
<p>squats in the gym, riding the Peloton,</p>
<p>or even if you&rsquo;re outside running</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting forward acceleration,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re never actually getting tilted, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never actually getting tilted</p>
<p>with respect to Earth&rsquo;s gravitational pull.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not really exercising</p>
<p>and getting the most out of your nervous system.</p>
<p>Activation of the cerebellum in this way of being tilted</p>
<p>or the head being tilted and the body being tilted</p>
<p>while in acceleration, typically forward acceleration,</p>
<p>but sometimes side to side,</p>
<p>has a profound and positive effect</p>
<p>on our sense of mood and wellbeing.</p>
<p>And as I talked about in previous episode,</p>
<p>it can also enhance our ability to learn information</p>
<p>in the period after generating those tilts</p>
<p>and the acceleration.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the cerebellum has these outputs</p>
<p>to these areas of the brain</p>
<p>that release these neuromodulators</p>
<p>like serotonin and dopamine,</p>
<p>and they make us feel really good.</p>
<p>I think this is one of the reasons why growing up,</p>
<p>I had some friends, some of whom might&rsquo;ve been,</p>
<p>the world heavyweight champions of laziness</p>
<p>for essentially everything,</p>
<p>except they would wake up at 4.30 in the morning</p>
<p>to go surf.</p>
<p>They would like drive.</p>
<p>They would get up so early to go surf.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just surfers.</p>
<p>And some surfers, by the way, I should point out</p>
<p>are not lazy humans.</p>
<p>They do a lot of other things,</p>
<p>but I knew people that couldn&rsquo;t be motivated</p>
<p>to do anything,</p>
<p>but they were highly driven to get into these experiences</p>
<p>of forward acceleration while tilted</p>
<p>with respect to gravity.</p>
<p>Likewise, with snowboarding or skiing or cycling,</p>
<p>those modes of exercise seem to have an outsized effect</p>
<p>both on our wellbeing and our ability to translate</p>
<p>the vestibular balance that we achieve in those endeavors</p>
<p>to our ability to balance while doing other things.</p>
<p>So, and I don&rsquo;t mean psychological balance necessarily.</p>
<p>I mean, physical balance.</p>
<p>So for those of you that don&rsquo;t think of yourselves</p>
<p>as very coordinated or with very good balance,</p>
<p>getting into these modes of acceleration,</p>
<p>forward movement or lateral movement while getting tilted,</p>
<p>even if you have to do it slowly, could be beneficial.</p>
<p>I do believe, and the scientific literature points</p>
<p>to the fact that it will be beneficial</p>
<p>for cultivating better sense of physical balance.</p>
<p>It can really build up the circuits</p>
<p>of this vestibular system.</p>
<p>And then of course, the feel good components</p>
<p>of acceleration while tilted or while getting the head</p>
<p>into different orientations relative to gravity.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the explanation for roller coasters.</p>
<p>Some people hate roller coasters.</p>
<p>They make them feel nauseous.</p>
<p>Many people love roller coasters.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons they love roller coasters</p>
<p>is because of the way that when you get the body,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re not generating the movement,</p>
<p>you get the body into forward acceleration</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going upside down and tilted to the side</p>
<p>as the tracks go from side to side and tilt, et cetera,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting activation of these deeper brain nuclei</p>
<p>that trigger the release of neuromodulators</p>
<p>that just make us feel really, really good.</p>
<p>In fact, some people get a long arc,</p>
<p>a long duration kind of buzz</p>
<p>from having gone through those experiences.</p>
<p>Some people who hate roller coasters</p>
<p>are probably getting nauseous just hearing about that.</p>
<p>So I encourage people to get into modes of acceleration</p>
<p>while tilted every once in a while,</p>
<p>provided you can do it safely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an immensely powerful way to build up your skills</p>
<p>in the realm of balance.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also, for most people, very, very pleasing.</p>
<p>It feels really good because of the chemical relationship</p>
<p>between forward acceleration and head tilt and body tilt.</p>
<p>Now, speaking of feeling nauseous,</p>
<p>some people suffer from vertigo.</p>
<p>Some people feel dizzy.</p>
<p>Some people get lightheaded.</p>
<p>An important question to ask yourself always</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re feeling quote-unquote dizzy or lightheaded is,</p>
<p>are you dizzy or are you lightheaded?</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;re not going to diagnose anything here</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s just no way we can do that.</p>
<p>This is essentially me shouting into a tunnel,</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>with each and every one of you.</p>
<p>But if ever you feel that your world is spinning,</p>
<p>but that you can focus on your thumb, for instance,</p>
<p>but the rest of the world is spinning</p>
<p>and your thumb is stationary, that&rsquo;s called being dizzy.</p>
<p>Now, if you feel like you&rsquo;re falling</p>
<p>or that you feel like you need to get down onto the ground</p>
<p>because you feel lightheaded, that&rsquo;s being lightheaded.</p>
<p>And oftentimes with language,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t distinguish between being dizzy</p>
<p>and being lightheaded.</p>
<p>Now, there are a lot of ways that dizziness</p>
<p>and lightheadedness can occur.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t even want to begin to guess</p>
<p>at the number of different things and ways</p>
<p>that it could happen for those of you that suffer from it,</p>
<p>because it could be any number of them.</p>
<p>But oftentimes if people are lightheaded,</p>
<p>yes, it could be low blood sugar.</p>
<p>It could also be that you&rsquo;re dehydrated.</p>
<p>It could also be that you are low in electrolytes.</p>
<p>We talked about this in a previous episode,</p>
<p>but we will talk about it more in a future episode.</p>
<p>Many people have too little sodium in their system, salt,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why they feel lightheaded.</p>
<p>I have family members who for years</p>
<p>thought they had disrupted blood sugar.</p>
<p>They would get shaky, jittery, lightheaded,</p>
<p>feel like they were nauseous, et cetera.</p>
<p>And simply the addition of a little sea salt to their water</p>
<p>remedied the problem entirely.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to remedy</p>
<p>every issue of lightheadedness out there by any stretch,</p>
<p>but just the addition of salt in this particular case</p>
<p>helped the person, and they are not alone.</p>
<p>Many people who think that they have low blood sugar</p>
<p>actually are lightheaded because of low electrolytes</p>
<p>and because of the way that salt carries water</p>
<p>into the system and creates changes in blood volume,</p>
<p>et cetera, low sodium can often be a source</p>
<p>of lightheadedness, as can low blood sugar,</p>
<p>and of course, other things as well.</p>
<p>Now for dizziness or seasickness,</p>
<p>we were all taught that you need to pick a point</p>
<p>on the horizon and focus on it,</p>
<p>but actually that&rsquo;s not correct.</p>
<p>It is true that if you are down in the cabin of a boat</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re on the lower deck,</p>
<p>and all you can see are things up close to you,</p>
<p>that getting sloshed around like so,</p>
<p>or the boat going up and down like so,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m getting a little seasick</p>
<p>even as I do this and I describe it.</p>
<p>Focusing on things close to you can be problematic.</p>
<p>And in that case, the advice to go up on deck</p>
<p>and get fresh air and to look off into the horizon,</p>
<p>that part is correct.</p>
<p>But focusing your eyes on a particular location</p>
<p>on the horizon is effectively like trying</p>
<p>to move very slowly as I had you do before,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re trying to move your head very slowly</p>
<p>while fixating on one location.</p>
<p>Your eyes and your balance system</p>
<p>were designed to move together.</p>
<p>So really what you want to do is allow your visual system</p>
<p>to track with your vestibular system.</p>
<p>This is why sitting in the back of an Uber or a taxi</p>
<p>and being on your phone</p>
<p>can make you suddenly feel very nauseous.</p>
<p>Sometimes the cabs, particularly in New York City,</p>
<p>they have a lot of occluders.</p>
<p>They have a lot of stuff blocking your field of view.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s usually a little portal out</p>
<p>that where you can see out to the front of the windshield,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s all this stuff now.</p>
<p>Television&rsquo;s in the backseat</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re watching that television and the cab is moving.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in linear acceleration</p>
<p>and sometimes you&rsquo;re taking corners, you&rsquo;re braking.</p>
<p>So then your vestibular system has to adjust to that.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking at your phone or a book</p>
<p>or even if you&rsquo;re talking to somebody,</p>
<p>actually I&rsquo;m starting to feel a little nauseous</p>
<p>I promise I&rsquo;m not going to finish this episode</p>
<p>by vomiting at the end, at least not here.</p>
<p>But what can happen is that you&rsquo;re uncoupling</p>
<p>the visual information from your motion,</p>
<p>from your vestibular information.</p>
<p>You want those to be coupled.</p>
<p>This is why a lot of people have to drive.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t be in the passenger seat</p>
<p>because when you drive,</p>
<p>you also get what&rsquo;s called proprioceptive feedback.</p>
<p>Your body is sending signals also to the vestibular system</p>
<p>about where you are in space.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re the passenger,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just getting jolted around as the person is driving.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re looking at your phone, it&rsquo;s even worse.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re looking at the occluder between you</p>
<p>and the two front seats, that&rsquo;s even worse.</p>
<p>So this is why staring out the front windshield is great</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t want to fixate.</p>
<p>Okay, so hopefully I spared a few people</p>
<p>and hopefully a few cab drivers</p>
<p>of having people get sick in their cars or Ubers.</p>
<p>Let your visual system</p>
<p>and your vestibular system work together.</p>
<p>If appropriate, get into linear acceleration</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll improve your sense of balance.</p>
<p>Once again, we&rsquo;ve covered a tremendous amount of information.</p>
<p>Now you know how you hear,</p>
<p>how you make sense of the sounds in your environment,</p>
<p>how those come into your ears</p>
<p>and how your brain processes them.</p>
<p>In addition, we talked about things</p>
<p>like low-level white noise and even binaural beats</p>
<p>which can be used to enhance certain brain states,</p>
<p>certain rhythms within the brain,</p>
<p>and even dopamine release in ways that allow you</p>
<p>to learn better.</p>
<p>And we talked about the balance system</p>
<p>and this incredible relationship</p>
<p>between your vestibular apparatus,</p>
<p>meaning the portions of your inner ear</p>
<p>that are responsible for balance</p>
<p>and your visual system and gravity.</p>
<p>And you can use those to enhance your learning as well,</p>
<p>as well as just to enhance your sense of balance.</p>
