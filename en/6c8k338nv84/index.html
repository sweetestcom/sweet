<p>Ôªø[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>welcome back everyone we&rsquo;re here with</p>
<p>another show and today we have some</p>
<p>really interesting questions and you</p>
<p>know just as always my disclaimer is I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not going to claim to provide any cures</p>
<p>or anything to even prevent any illness</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s up to you to check with your doctor</p>
<p>to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t conflict with</p>
<p>your medications all right Steve let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Dive Right In a lot of questions lined</p>
<p>up I can imagine and if any of you feel</p>
<p>better just keep it to yourself for</p>
<p>goodness sakes right exactly all right</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see now uh hang on just a moment I</p>
<p>need to do something on my little</p>
<p>control board and then why don&rsquo;t we kick</p>
<p>things off right away with our first</p>
<p>question of the day and there are some</p>
<p>interesting ones here and Dr Berg there</p>
<p>you go</p>
<p>okay question are cancer cells more</p>
<p>acidic or more alkaline</p>
<p>all right</p>
<p>folks jump on that one and let&rsquo;s see why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we go to social</p>
<p>media uh let&rsquo;s see the very first person</p>
<p>that echoed in this morning was Miles</p>
<p>Jericho from YouTube thank you for</p>
<p>sharing your information about the keto</p>
<p>diet it has cleared up my skin issues</p>
<p>and I have reached my ideal weight but</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m too skinny oh I dream of such</p>
<p>things well eating chickpeas help me</p>
<p>maintain a healthy weight</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;d have to eat a lot of them but I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if I would go after that I</p>
<p>would definitely at least increase your</p>
<p>fat because that way</p>
<p>um your body will go after the dietary</p>
<p>fat as the with the ketones versus your</p>
<p>own stored fat so you&rsquo;ll stop losing</p>
<p>weight and then maybe add exercise to</p>
<p>start to stimulate more muscle growth</p>
<p>and also maybe raise your carbs at the</p>
<p>highest level like at 50 grams a day you</p>
<p>know throw some berries in there you</p>
<p>want to throw some some</p>
<p>you know peas in there if you want to do</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>um but just make sure that um</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t go too high with that um that car</p>
<p>level because it&rsquo;s going to knock you</p>
<p>out of ketosis but yeah it is a that is</p>
<p>the big problem with ketosis is</p>
<p>eventually you get too skinny and then</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a big problem so you have to kind</p>
<p>of weigh out what problem you want you</p>
<p>want to be too skinny or you want to be</p>
<p>too fat</p>
<p>all right now uh here&rsquo;s something sort</p>
<p>of encouraging Magi Maggie the cat as</p>
<p>she calls herself from YouTube thanks</p>
<p>for all that you do I had multiple</p>
<p>nodules on my neck and thyroid I have</p>
<p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s I started drinking a Sia</p>
<p>redox if I said that right and my</p>
<p>nodules are all gone thank you</p>
<p>fantastic and again</p>
<p>um any cures that people have with</p>
<p>anything just don&rsquo;t mention our names</p>
<p>because we have no no connection with</p>
<p>cures over here at all that&rsquo;s right okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s carry on with um</p>
<p>social media also from YouTube Christy</p>
<p>what would you recommend to treat</p>
<p>frequent UTIs oh that&rsquo;s not fun</p>
<p>honestly I think I would I would if that</p>
<p>was me I would do the methylene blue you</p>
<p>know do uh</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>about 20 drops a day maybe up to 40</p>
<p>drops a day and that&rsquo;s very very low</p>
<p>and uh do it to the point where urine</p>
<p>turns green that&rsquo;s not a problem because</p>
<p>the blue if you mix blue with yellow it</p>
<p>comes out green and what that&rsquo;ll do is</p>
<p>it it&rsquo;ll concentrate a bit more in your</p>
<p>bladder making it very unfriendly</p>
<p>environment for those microbes that are</p>
<p>causing the UTI</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s one great I mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>thoroughly researched but methylene blue</p>
<p>is a good remedy for UTIs that&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>would recommend all right very good good</p>
<p>luck with that Christy and uh let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>here for anyone that&rsquo;s new to the</p>
<p>various uh Lifestyles here in Dr Berg</p>
<p>tati tati from YouTube asks can you</p>
<p>provide a basic explanation of what keto</p>
<p>is and why it&rsquo;s good for us</p>
<p>yeah you know we always say that keto is</p>
<p>an alternative uh fuel for our body</p>
<p>cells</p>
<p>um honestly I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>alternative I think what we&rsquo;re doing now</p>
<p>eating so much glucose is an alternative</p>
<p>uh our bodies were not meant to or</p>
<p>designed to consume the amount of</p>
<p>glucose as fuel simply because look what</p>
<p>look what it created diabetics fatty</p>
<p>livers but when you go in the keto diet</p>
<p>your the</p>
<p>he</p>
<p>you lower your carbohydrates which then</p>
<p>force your cells to burn fat that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>it works and then when you burn the fat</p>
<p>it turns into ketones and your body can</p>
<p>use the ketones as fuel so the way you</p>
<p>do that is lowering your carbs and your</p>
<p>body has um can tap into your own body</p>
<p>fat for fuel</p>
<p>Ora has a choice of burning the dietary</p>
<p>fat as fuel</p>
<p>so you might say well doesn&rsquo;t certain</p>
<p>parts of your body need sugar</p>
<p>um yes certain a small percentage of</p>
<p>your body needs sugar or requires only</p>
<p>sugar as the fuel but your body can make</p>
<p>that through a new system well it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a new system but it&rsquo;s a system called</p>
<p>gluconeogenesis from your liver so it</p>
<p>can make any sugar it needs from other</p>
<p>things it doesn&rsquo;t need sugar so</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s what keto is it&rsquo;s a the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet you&rsquo;re burning ketones</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a great way to get healthy lose</p>
<p>weight and really help your brain too</p>
<p>and so I think that&rsquo;s the the simplest</p>
<p>definition I can think of or the</p>
<p>explanation of what it is</p>
<p>sounds great now I hate to be a Debbie</p>
<p>Downer but Natasha now from YouTube says</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on keto for three months uh</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t lost a pound what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on with poor Natasha well you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard to evaluate that because I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what else you&rsquo;re doing I don&rsquo;t many</p>
<p>many times when I when someone says that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say well what are you eating and</p>
<p>then I find out it&rsquo;s not really the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet the other factor is um</p>
<p>are you doing in a minute fasting with</p>
<p>that because if you&rsquo;re not you need to</p>
<p>um I had a guy who went in the ketogenic</p>
<p>diet and lowered the carbs but he was</p>
<p>doing uh snacks between meals well I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry that even though you&rsquo;re burning uh</p>
<p>fat the dietary</p>
<p>calories and the fat coming in is going</p>
<p>to stop you from burning your own</p>
<p>reserves so you won&rsquo;t lose any weight</p>
<p>that way so you&rsquo;re gonna have to combine</p>
<p>the intermittent fasting with the keto</p>
<p>and then let&rsquo;s say you do that and it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work then the question is what</p>
<p>type of intermittent fasting are you</p>
<p>down to one once a day I will say that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re over the age of 50</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m like I&rsquo;m almost there</p>
<p>um what happens is that your body will</p>
<p>um doesn&rsquo;t need as much food our</p>
<p>metabolism is slow down a bit so I think</p>
<p>this is my personal opinion that</p>
<p>everyone should do one meal a day and um</p>
<p>some people think that&rsquo;s extreme but do</p>
<p>you really need that many calories one</p>
<p>meal a day over 50 you&rsquo;ll start losing</p>
<p>weight now if your metabolism is really</p>
<p>messed up then you might have to take it</p>
<p>one step further but and do some</p>
<p>periodic prolonged fasting but the point</p>
<p>is that um</p>
<p>you know doing the cinnamon fasting with</p>
<p>keto should work and there&rsquo;s always an</p>
<p>exception so I&rsquo;ve done videos on that</p>
<p>you can watch my Plateau videos on that</p>
<p>okay great questions audience and also a</p>
<p>great response from our first question</p>
<p>which asked are cancer cells more acidic</p>
<p>or are they more alkaline and the</p>
<p>audience sixty percent of them say that</p>
<p>they are acidic and 40 say they are</p>
<p>alkaline they&rsquo;re all crossing their</p>
<p>fingers who&rsquo;s correct</p>
<p>look it up look it up it&rsquo;s um the inside</p>
<p>of the cancer the cell itself is is is</p>
<p>more alkaline than normal cells it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more alkaline interesting interesting uh</p>
<p>we always say that cancer is more acidic</p>
<p>but what you&rsquo;re describing when you say</p>
<p>that is you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re describing what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>outside the cell in cancer and that is</p>
<p>more acidic so because of the byproduct</p>
<p>of lactic acid so yes it is more acidic</p>
<p>on the outside but not inside the cell</p>
<p>which is interesting</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m going to be releasing a video on</p>
<p>this and how this relates to</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>tumors</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>carbon dioxide which uh you know if you</p>
<p>start looking at cancer from the</p>
<p>Viewpoint of carbon dioxide carbon</p>
<p>dioxide helps us get oxygen</p>
<p>and so we know with cancer the metabolic</p>
<p>pathway</p>
<p>is uh</p>
<p>partially destroyed within the</p>
<p>mitochondria so the body then goes</p>
<p>outside the mitochondria in the in the</p>
<p>cytoplasm in the cell</p>
<p>with another pathway</p>
<p>but the question is how does this relate</p>
<p>to CO2 and there&rsquo;s some fascinating</p>
<p>fascinating data I was wondering well we</p>
<p>always talk about oxygen we&rsquo;re lacking</p>
<p>oxygen but could it be that CO2</p>
<p>can help the oxygen revive well there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some studies and I&rsquo;ll release that this</p>
<p>in a video that they use CO2 therapy to</p>
<p>help uh shrink tumors and to slow down</p>
<p>malignancy so that just is like</p>
<p>mind-blowing to me so stay tuned for</p>
<p>that information and how it can relate</p>
<p>to other things as well wow fascinating</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;ll tell you what was also</p>
<p>fascinating was watching Mary who&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>Illinois hang up on her boss when she</p>
<p>came on air here I hope she&rsquo;s still uh</p>
<p>you know employed after all this but in</p>
<p>deference to her we&rsquo;re going to put it</p>
<p>on the air and see if she can get her</p>
<p>job back Mary go with your one question</p>
<p>for Dr Berger on there make sure you</p>
<p>unmute yourself please</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hi Doug me</p>
<p>out</p>
<p>I loved your video about potassium</p>
<p>um versus sodium</p>
<p>intake and my question and so I</p>
<p>understand that</p>
<p>um but my question comes from when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing intermittent fasting or</p>
<p>prolonged fasting how do you get that</p>
<p>ratio is it by drinking four or five of</p>
<p>your electrolytes</p>
<p>um I I just that&rsquo;s where I don&rsquo;t on I</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m confused</p>
<p>good question because when you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>eating any food uh what happens to these</p>
<p>dietary requirements especially for</p>
<p>potassium that needs to be like</p>
<p>you know 4 700 milligrams</p>
<p>um here&rsquo;s the thing the requirements go</p>
<p>way down</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t go down to zero but they go</p>
<p>down because your body becomes more</p>
<p>efficient</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um your body starts to conserve things</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I would say</p>
<p>I would say two two of those scoops of</p>
<p>electrolyte power powder would give you</p>
<p>two thousand</p>
<p>um milligrams of potassium</p>
<p>and you may need to</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t have a lot of sodium in my</p>
<p>electrolyte powder so you might need to</p>
<p>add that sodium that sodium is really</p>
<p>important when you&rsquo;re doing fasting just</p>
<p>as much as potassium but</p>
<p>um you don&rsquo;t want to neglect that so the</p>
<p>reason why some people might get tired</p>
<p>when they fast is they don&rsquo;t do enough</p>
<p>sodium through the</p>
<p>um the sea salt</p>
<p>so I would do maybe um a half to a a</p>
<p>third of a teaspoon of salt in some</p>
<p>water maybe break it up into a couple</p>
<p>times a day and you already just put it</p>
<p>in the electrolyte powder and drink that</p>
<p>that should give you enough of that</p>
<p>those minerals But ultimately the way</p>
<p>that you</p>
<p>can just understand this is</p>
<p>start with something and then see do you</p>
<p>get do you get weakness are you feeling</p>
<p>great</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re good</p>
<p>um because it&rsquo;s really hard to know</p>
<p>exactly for every single person so these</p>
<p>are just guidelines</p>
<p>um but the requirements go down</p>
<p>when you do intermittent fasting which</p>
<p>is cool</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>now if you&rsquo;re exercising and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sweating while you&rsquo;re fasting</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the situation but typically when</p>
<p>people do prolonged fasting they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going</p>
<p>more than three days so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>minor point but if you&rsquo;re doing longer</p>
<p>fast likes a week two weeks three weeks</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you have cancer then you need</p>
<p>to um</p>
<p>keep those nutrients a bit High</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome that is so absolutely</p>
<p>great and even under threat of losing</p>
<p>her job she put out a perfectly executed</p>
<p>one Thirty second question and that is</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m impressed Grace under the pressure</p>
<p>right there so we thank you for that</p>
<p>Mary would love to typically typically</p>
<p>people will go well now as far as my</p>
<p>blood test I had high creatinine I had</p>
<p>this and that like I&rsquo;m it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>impossible to do some type of evaluation</p>
<p>on a blood test on a q a like this Steve</p>
<p>yeah and you know I tell I sort of brief</p>
<p>everybody in the audience for those who</p>
<p>might want to join us in future shows</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t worry Dr Berg is not going to</p>
<p>let you go until he finds out what he</p>
<p>needs to do to give you some counsel so</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to kind of give the</p>
<p>History Dr Berg somehow he gets to talk</p>
<p>as much as he wants so he can probe you</p>
<p>for all that stuff so don&rsquo;t worry so</p>
<p>anyway thank you Mary for that great</p>
<p>example let&rsquo;s move on to our next</p>
<p>question and Mary I hope you get this</p>
<p>right and here it is</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>why do some people feel better after</p>
<p>drinking carbonated water</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about soda just like the</p>
<p>carbonated water whether it&rsquo;s a Seltzer</p>
<p>or the uh</p>
<p>um the different drinks they have now</p>
<p>that are carbonated why would they feel</p>
<p>better</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s interesting I&rsquo;ve got one</p>
<p>collecting dust one of those carbonator</p>
<p>things so maybe I&rsquo;ll break it out again</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s hopeful news you you tell us</p>
<p>afterwards all right let&rsquo;s go back to</p>
<p>social media</p>
<p>um oh interesting Lydia from Facebook</p>
<p>wants to know if goat colostrum will</p>
<p>help me with my rheumatoid arthritis</p>
<p>colostrum is the first milk that</p>
<p>um that has some really interesting</p>
<p>things in it has immune factors it has</p>
<p>uh friendly microbes it kind of seeds</p>
<p>the gut so when you&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>autoimmune you&rsquo;re dealing with gut</p>
<p>issues so colostrum is going to be</p>
<p>really good and if you can get the goats</p>
<p>colostrum that&rsquo;s even better because it</p>
<p>has</p>
<p>um a better ratio of</p>
<p>of certain proteins similar to breast</p>
<p>milk but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it just works a little bit better if you</p>
<p>can find it so yes</p>
<p>um any autoimmune problem or if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on</p>
<p>steroids like prednisone like anything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of suppressing your immune</p>
<p>system that would be really good to</p>
<p>start and do small amounts over time</p>
<p>but colostrum is a kind of a a magical</p>
<p>thing</p>
<p>um and the reason I know a bit more</p>
<p>about it because we had a a cow that</p>
<p>would not um</p>
<p>feed its calf so we had to bottle feed</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>I started looking at the um the powdered</p>
<p>milk they have for that and I&rsquo;m like oh</p>
<p>my gosh it&rsquo;s not even milk it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s they added soy protein in there</p>
<p>all this other crap and um you talk to</p>
<p>any really good farmer and they always</p>
<p>start their calves out with colostrum</p>
<p>and they they even can give it</p>
<p>supplemented but we we found a farmer</p>
<p>that um gave us some raw milk and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re using uh and uh wow talk</p>
<p>about a thriving calf amazing</p>
<p>all right interesting uh Meshach from</p>
<p>YouTube what alternatives would you</p>
<p>suggest for someone who is allergic to</p>
<p>cheese oh that kills me</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>you could either be sensitive to the</p>
<p>lactose the milkshere which is probably</p>
<p>not the problem it could be the the</p>
<p>casein in there</p>
<p>um but</p>
<p>you may be allergic maybe get a test but</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re not allergic and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still reacting the type of the cheese</p>
<p>matters for example</p>
<p>if you get European cheese that is</p>
<p>usually like raw you can get real raw</p>
<p>European cheese you could probably get</p>
<p>in America you have to search search it</p>
<p>out because it&rsquo;s kind of illegal you</p>
<p>have to find some company that sells it</p>
<p>because they just paid more they paid</p>
<p>the the fine and they&rsquo;re able to sell it</p>
<p>but that raw milk cheese is um super</p>
<p>healthy and it&rsquo;s um there&rsquo;s less</p>
<p>allergies with that than</p>
<p>the cheeses that you&rsquo;d get in America so</p>
<p>the quality of the cheese you could be</p>
<p>reacting just because it&rsquo;s not as</p>
<p>quality but um but let&rsquo;s say for example</p>
<p>you are reacting and then maybe you get</p>
<p>a and you need some Dairy maybe you find</p>
<p>a lactose</p>
<p>free if it is lactose I don&rsquo;t know uh</p>
<p>kefir that would be ideal but</p>
<p>and also</p>
<p>um Kefir is a good dairy product that</p>
<p>has a lot of microbes and it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>nearly have the amount of the casein</p>
<p>protein</p>
<p>as um</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s cheese too because cheese kind</p>
<p>of concentrates that protein</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I release this or not</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll be releasing</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>a good way to detect if you have</p>
<p>allergies using your pulse rate</p>
<p>and you can detect that</p>
<p>just by checking your pulse rate after</p>
<p>you eat it at a certain interval so stay</p>
<p>tuned for that video just to see if you</p>
<p>really have analogy or not that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting well you know one of the</p>
<p>gratifying things with all the</p>
<p>differences we might have around the</p>
<p>world on all the politics and so on we</p>
<p>all seem to celebrate uh living well and</p>
<p>feeling healthier and I&rsquo;ve never seen</p>
<p>such evidence of that as I have on Dr</p>
<p>Berg show and here&rsquo;s evidence a good</p>
<p>morning to all of our viewers joining us</p>
<p>today from the UK Canada Mexico New</p>
<p>Zealand Malaysia South Africa Jordan</p>
<p>Switzerland Albania Scotland Slovakia</p>
<p>Spain Austria Pakistan Kenya Armenia</p>
<p>Venezuela the Philippines India France</p>
<p>Nigeria Sweden Norway Poland Belgium</p>
<p>Russia Israel the Virgin Islands Nepal</p>
<p>Oman Oman excuse me Saudi Arabia the</p>
<p>Netherlands Greece Chile Italy Peru the</p>
<p>Dominican Republic Trinidad and Trinidad</p>
<p>excuse me in Tobago Romania Jamaica Hong</p>
<p>Kong Haiti Azerbaijan</p>
<p>on Madagascar Singapore Cyprus Ethiopia</p>
<p>Ethiopia excuse me and all across these</p>
<p>United States and undoubtedly we&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>some more chiming in because everyone</p>
<p>wants to be recognized for their pursuit</p>
<p>of great wonderful life and healthy</p>
<p>living and all that why not so thank you</p>
<p>everybody for listening around the world</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see uh we&rsquo;re still waiting for</p>
<p>answer for our next Quiz question in the</p>
<p>meantime Tamika from Facebook can you</p>
<p>offer any advice on treating</p>
<p>diverticulitis</p>
<p>anything involving itis&rsquo;s of the colon</p>
<p>any of that stuff</p>
<p>you need to um</p>
<p>look at your fiber and make sure that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not aggravating things I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>talked about that last week with um you</p>
<p>know if you have inflammation in your</p>
<p>gut you should probably do carnivore for</p>
<p>a while to start to reduce this the</p>
<p>irritation so that&rsquo;s one big factor and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not just talking about all the new</p>
<p>fangle fibers that they&rsquo;re coming out</p>
<p>with now but I&rsquo;m just talking about even</p>
<p>vegetables as well you might be reacting</p>
<p>to that so</p>
<p>um and then of course</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the Omega like for example a lot of nuts</p>
<p>can do it as well and of course I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>giving I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re not doing</p>
<p>beans and things like that which can</p>
<p>really bloat people and create problems</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>um the carnivore seems to be the best</p>
<p>thing for that and doing it healthily</p>
<p>um as far as remedies go uh there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something called n a g you can get as a</p>
<p>supplement</p>
<p>and uh it&rsquo;s basically a combination</p>
<p>between um</p>
<p>a sugar and an amino acid and it helps</p>
<p>it helps to build up that mucosal layer</p>
<p>of your colon that gets destroyed</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like a precursor so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called n a g</p>
<p>um you can just look online and just get</p>
<p>that as a product that&rsquo;s good for a lot</p>
<p>of things especially gut</p>
<p>um and so um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I would recommend</p>
<p>all right very good and here I think is</p>
<p>an important question John from YouTube</p>
<p>can meditate excuse me medications or</p>
<p>supplements knock you out of keto</p>
<p>yes absolutely</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the supplements that Knock You Out have</p>
<p>carbs</p>
<p>okay or or like protein like like the</p>
<p>Whey Protein which is very high on the</p>
<p>insulin scale so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s one thing that can do it but</p>
<p>typical regular vitamins and minerals</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t knock you out</p>
<p>um as far as medications go there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of them that will</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve done a video on that so you</p>
<p>can you can check it out but um you know</p>
<p>Steve what blows me away about</p>
<p>medications</p>
<p>is that um</p>
<p>the effects that occur the side effects</p>
<p>that it creates are just they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>looked at close enough there are so many</p>
<p>additional complications that are just</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>mind-blowing to me to how many side</p>
<p>effects that then then they treat you</p>
<p>with that another medication for that</p>
<p>side effect and you go down this rabbit</p>
<p>hole and unfortunately when you go to</p>
<p>the doctor a lot of times</p>
<p>they might find something that say oh we</p>
<p>need to do more testing that scares the</p>
<p>hell out of me because it&rsquo;s like okay</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re going to send it to another</p>
<p>specialist and we found this that you</p>
<p>know all of a sudden now we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>treat that and it just gets really kind</p>
<p>of crazy with um</p>
<p>this whole racket of over specialization</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s really looking at the</p>
<p>connection of anything and the side</p>
<p>effects of things they&rsquo;re not looking at</p>
<p>that instead they send you to a</p>
<p>specialist and they&rsquo;re not looking at</p>
<p>the elephant in the room the obvious</p>
<p>stuff and they don&rsquo;t emphasize the diet</p>
<p>so um I mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crazy it&rsquo;s crazy uh to kind of get</p>
<p>into that system and going round and</p>
<p>round and round which I see so many</p>
<p>people</p>
<p>go through well it&rsquo;s also you listen to</p>
<p>those ads in tryplovenia for so and so</p>
<p>may cause violent death Agony horror all</p>
<p>that I care about those little things</p>
<p>you know make you think about it but</p>
<p>anyway so let&rsquo;s uh let&rsquo;s answer a quiz</p>
<p>question so our second question for the</p>
<p>day was expertly answered and it asked</p>
<p>why do some people feel better after</p>
<p>drinking carbonated water and 90 say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the acidic levels help with feeling</p>
<p>full and 10 say mineral content can</p>
<p>improve overall health are they onto</p>
<p>something doctor</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on the something I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re on to but they&rsquo;re onto</p>
<p>something I uh</p>
<p>um I did a video in this a while ago I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>updating it because I I think I found</p>
<p>the real reason and it has to do with</p>
<p>what CO2 does to oxygen allows the</p>
<p>oxygen to get</p>
<p>penetrated deep into your cells and so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what this carbonated water is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re pumping CO2 into it</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re consuming it there&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>lot of if any research on this but I</p>
<p>think this is why but there is a lot of</p>
<p>research on co2 uh bath spas in Europe</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re going into this bath and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just fusing CO2 and people are it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great for peripheral vascular problems</p>
<p>diabetics that are they can&rsquo;t heal</p>
<p>their wounds right it&rsquo;s good for that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like wow even when you go into Hot</p>
<p>Springs you&rsquo;re natural Hot Springs are</p>
<p>low with CO2 and so you&rsquo;re getting this</p>
<p>infusement we&rsquo;ll see it too and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting more oxygen so you it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>counterintuitive you don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>this it&rsquo;s called the bore effect b-o-h-r</p>
<p>effect you can look it up it allows</p>
<p>oxygen to be absorbed</p>
<p>um but I mean there this goes all the</p>
<p>way from beauty creams by putting CO2 in</p>
<p>this cream and putting on your face for</p>
<p>scarring and wrinkles to um</p>
<p>um just the spas and uh so if you can</p>
<p>consume CO2 right</p>
<p>um it can actually help your oxygen and</p>
<p>I I notice when I drink carbonated water</p>
<p>I just feel</p>
<p>better it feels more hydrating I feel</p>
<p>more relaxed because it also stimulates</p>
<p>the parasympathetic nervous system so</p>
<p>stay tuned for a video on that and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more to know about that as well</p>
<p>and so I don&rsquo;t know why I get such</p>
<p>Delight over admonishing the audience</p>
<p>when they have like zero correct even</p>
<p>though I don&rsquo;t know any better but</p>
<p>anyway audience you&rsquo;re going to get a</p>
<p>chance to redeem yourself from really</p>
<p>um not getting that answer right</p>
<p>collectively and here&rsquo;s the next</p>
<p>question for the audience</p>
<p>okay why do people sleep better after a</p>
<p>thunderstorm</p>
<p>where my cat certainly doesn&rsquo;t but get</p>
<p>on that audience and let us know what</p>
<p>you think about that and by the way</p>
<p>there were actually more viewers that</p>
<p>want to be recognized and they&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Indonesia Japan Kosovo Australia</p>
<p>Colombia Panama Hungary Dubai turkey and</p>
<p>Taiwan thank you all so much on behalf</p>
<p>of Dr Berg for listening that is uh</p>
<p>terrific why don&rsquo;t we go back to our</p>
<p>green room and this time we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>pick on Brett who is from Buffalo New</p>
<p>York and he announced that Buffalo is</p>
<p>going to call in for more snow on Monday</p>
<p>can you believe that that place I just</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t oh my goodness that&rsquo;s where my</p>
<p>wife went to uh college so my gosh it</p>
<p>gets cold there it gets really cold and</p>
<p>snowy wow well Brad if you&rsquo;re unmuted</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on with Dr Berg well one question</p>
<p>please 30 seconds</p>
<p>foreign</p>
<p>Dr Berg our retired Marine here uh my my</p>
<p>question concern is I don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>gallbladder spleener appendix and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>concerned about the absorption of</p>
<p>vitamin and vitamins and supplements and</p>
<p>also the timing of when to take my</p>
<p>um supplements of vitamins while</p>
<p>intermediate fasting okay good question</p>
<p>questions</p>
<p>um I think a good way to know if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>absorbing these fat soluble vitamins</p>
<p>vitamin A D E K1 and K2 is um just to um</p>
<p>a couple ways you can notice your vision</p>
<p>at night can you see well in the dark</p>
<p>can you um</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in in the backyard with your</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>your ak-15 and your your sniper rifle</p>
<p>can you see good in the dark that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>big question but if another way is just</p>
<p>to see if your stool Floats or not if it</p>
<p>floats it means you&rsquo;re not digesting</p>
<p>your fats so you need more bile salt so</p>
<p>you just take take some bile salts like</p>
<p>right after the meal and that way it can</p>
<p>actually help uh absorb and</p>
<p>and then the thing is like if you have</p>
<p>too much you&rsquo;ll go the other way and you</p>
<p>might have diarrhea so it&rsquo;s that stool</p>
<p>that um</p>
<p>that gives you a lot of Clues on what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on with the bile</p>
<p>um so that&rsquo;s uh that&rsquo;s some simple ways</p>
<p>but yeah you&rsquo;re right so if you have the</p>
<p>gallbladder out</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re usually always going to be</p>
<p>deficient in the concentration of</p>
<p>um absorption</p>
<p>of bile and then absorption of the fat</p>
<p>the a the D the E the K1 and K2 and then</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done videos on the symptoms of</p>
<p>those you can look look for that but I</p>
<p>think the night vision is a really good</p>
<p>indicator to know about fat soluble</p>
<p>vitamins as well as the stool</p>
<p>great thank you</p>
<p>hey you&rsquo;re welcome and then one last</p>
<p>thing about that if</p>
<p>um realize too if you&rsquo;re taking up like</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>sauerkraut or fermented uh</p>
<p>probiotic type thing that those guys</p>
<p>also build up uh bile salts so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another way to get bile salts is by</p>
<p>improving the gut Flora so just want to</p>
<p>throw that out there with tooth could be</p>
<p>a good</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>supplement yeah tatka is a good one</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>more in between the meals because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>used to thin the bile</p>
<p>um I would do a regular bile salt after</p>
<p>the meal but Tucka is</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as good uh</p>
<p>with a meal it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s better to take uh</p>
<p>between the meal and um then it has to</p>
<p>kind of Chase through the body that uh</p>
<p>into the digestive tract so I think that</p>
<p>would be a better situation if you had</p>
<p>um sludge in your bile ducts that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>backing up to the liver which could</p>
<p>happen too because if you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>enough bile your bile becomes sluggish</p>
<p>and you would have a right shoulder pain</p>
<p>or pain that wraps around the back of</p>
<p>the rhomboid if that happens then you</p>
<p>need to cut or underneath a tightness</p>
<p>underneath your right rib cage then you</p>
<p>definitely need tight cut</p>
<p>great thank you okay thanks Brett that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great thanks so much Brett and thank you</p>
<p>for your service we all appreciate it</p>
<p>here in the U.S and let&rsquo;s see what do we</p>
<p>have next mumac from YouTube please make</p>
<p>a video about uh clots now</p>
<p>Terry put pots I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>acronym for something else how can I</p>
<p>stop clots from forming</p>
<p>okay so yeah pots is a that&rsquo;s where you</p>
<p>stand up and get really dizzy but clots</p>
<p>are a little different</p>
<p>um that has to do with um</p>
<p>you know people say it&rsquo;s too much</p>
<p>vitamin K1 but it&rsquo;s not because your</p>
<p>body if you have enough K1 you you won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>over clot with that uh the clotting</p>
<p>happens when you&rsquo;re eating too many</p>
<p>carbs and uh things are oxidizing</p>
<p>um so one way to uh prevent clots is to</p>
<p>have enough vitamin E Foods in the diet</p>
<p>cutting out the carbs garlic will will</p>
<p>decrease the clotting Factor but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also something else that&rsquo;s involved with</p>
<p>clots and that has to do with</p>
<p>calcium calcium if you are if you have</p>
<p>too much calcium that can form too many</p>
<p>clots if you&rsquo;re deficient in calcium</p>
<p>that can cause bruising which is</p>
<p>interesting because the calcium does</p>
<p>affect the clotting factors this is why</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>when people are deficient in calcium</p>
<p>that if you look on the bottom of their</p>
<p>legs they&rsquo;ll have these little red</p>
<p>tiny little</p>
<p>spots or black and blue little spots</p>
<p>um and that&rsquo;s that could be caused from</p>
<p>a calcium problem too so but typically</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if you just get your diet correct with</p>
<p>the healthy keto human fasting uh the</p>
<p>clotting will go to where it needs to go</p>
<p>and um you&rsquo;ll be fine that&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>would recommend</p>
<p>all right very good and uh the latest</p>
<p>question this is number three for the</p>
<p>day</p>
<p>why do people sleep better after a</p>
<p>thunderstorm except for pets and the</p>
<p>audience 75 percent of our respondents</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s because of the positively</p>
<p>charged ion ion excuse me in the</p>
<p>atmosphere 20 say it&rsquo;s because of</p>
<p>increased negative ions and five percent</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s increased ozone levels which</p>
<p>can mimic uh bariatric oxygen therapy</p>
<p>boy they have really done their research</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all correct yeah but there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>more thing there&rsquo;s one more thing about</p>
<p>uh thunderstorm and uh bad weather you</p>
<p>have a um significant increase in CO2</p>
<p>so we got the CO2 again right got the</p>
<p>CO2 allowing the oxygen to go you know</p>
<p>improved you know absorption in your</p>
<p>body which is another interesting thing</p>
<p>about this CO2 that keeps coming up over</p>
<p>and over and over again so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know I just love thunderstorms right</p>
<p>after you sleep like a baby of course</p>
<p>keep the window open if you can but uh</p>
<p>um yeah you&rsquo;re thinking it&rsquo;s just oxygen</p>
<p>no no it&rsquo;s CO2 that&rsquo;s helping the O2 go</p>
<p>into your body uh CO2 has gotten a bad</p>
<p>rap recently and uh we&rsquo;re just trying to</p>
<p>repair its relationship Steve very good</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s all fascinating stuff and we</p>
<p>had a big Boomer early this morning and</p>
<p>I just love them for some reason uh Lily</p>
<p>Rose from YouTube what are your thoughts</p>
<p>about adding kimchi to our diets</p>
<p>I have a lot of good thoughts about that</p>
<p>I just had some the other day um yeah</p>
<p>kimchi is um</p>
<p>hands down a very I mean just like take</p>
<p>a look at the ingredients you have</p>
<p>you got the uh the cabbage in there you</p>
<p>have sometimes bok choy sometimes Chili</p>
<p>Peppers I mean like everything in there</p>
<p>plus it&rsquo;s fermented so you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>all these great microbes I mean</p>
<p>if you could</p>
<p>do this I think it could be a</p>
<p>significant Improvement in your health</p>
<p>if you just had a half a cup of either</p>
<p>sauerkraut or kimcheed every single day</p>
<p>just do that that could be a simple huge</p>
<p>uh positive influence on creating more</p>
<p>health</p>
<p>I guess an interesting one of concerning</p>
<p>one Joyce from Facebook who doesn&rsquo;t let</p>
<p>us know how old she is but she says she</p>
<p>has brown spots spreading all over her</p>
<p>face and it&rsquo;s creating some self-esteem</p>
<p>issues I&rsquo;m sure it is please help me</p>
<p>well of course I would the first</p>
<p>question I would ask you is what are you</p>
<p>eating get around the right basic eating</p>
<p>plan which you can download right off my</p>
<p>site for free immediately but some other</p>
<p>things that can help brown spots are the</p>
<p>um the um the vitamin C serums</p>
<p>um they can actually get rid of those</p>
<p>spots very easily</p>
<p>and so you might want to try those</p>
<p>serums skin vitamin C serums uh there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other things too there&rsquo;s other</p>
<p>things but that&rsquo;s the thing that uh is</p>
<p>like a no-brainer very easy solution</p>
<p>all right poor Kathleen from Facebook is</p>
<p>hearing from doctors and other experts</p>
<p>that vitamin D3 and K2 and mk7 are not</p>
<p>good for you they suggest three bowls of</p>
<p>Captain Crunch I&rsquo;m sure what are your</p>
<p>thoughts</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re going to get a lot of</p>
<p>opposing viewpoints out there um</p>
<p>um I I would just find out why show me</p>
<p>the show me the studies uh make sure and</p>
<p>look see if it makes sense it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I know this is shocking Steve but you</p>
<p>could literally find</p>
<p>whatever the consensus is State and</p>
<p>especially in medicine</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>go the opposite direction because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s not science science is</p>
<p>not consensus it&rsquo;s not about it&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>popular opinion it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>and we should be able to question things</p>
<p>right we should be able to have other</p>
<p>viewpoints without being attacked right</p>
<p>like oh the science is settled and you</p>
<p>should not speak your view other</p>
<p>alternate Viewpoint I mean that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not science</p>
<p>um but yeah I would um I found</p>
<p>throughout history it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>consensus usually it&rsquo;s the truth is in</p>
<p>the opposite direction</p>
<p>wow well you know for those in our</p>
<p>audience who don&rsquo;t know who Karen is Dr</p>
<p>Berg&rsquo;s wife uh someone&rsquo;s asking about</p>
<p>her or wants to know if we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>see her again and I can tell you she&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lovely talented and entertaining woman</p>
<p>uh but she doesn&rsquo;t have as big a ego as</p>
<p>I am so she doesn&rsquo;t come on the air all</p>
<p>the time but what about that are we</p>
<p>going to see uh care never again for a</p>
<p>little cameo</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;re just talking about that where</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re thinking about what type of um</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s going to be creating some</p>
<p>interesting uh videos on</p>
<p>preserving herbs and things with at</p>
<p>various properties Health properties so</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s she does that now and so yeah</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s we just talked about that and how</p>
<p>how we can</p>
<p>um do some more of those videos uh</p>
<p>because uh a lot of people are like</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s Karen but uh she&rsquo;s right in the</p>
<p>other room right now so um yeah she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>here we just need to put her on film and</p>
<p>have her do her her magic and she is</p>
<p>definitely</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m more straight dry she&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very um</p>
<p>yeah she balances me out really well</p>
<p>she I can tell she&rsquo;s using the other</p>
<p>room with her hand over Charlie the</p>
<p>dog&rsquo;s mouth because Charlie likes to be</p>
<p>on the show just like I do and he&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>yell back there so she&rsquo;s containing him</p>
<p>but no she&rsquo;s wonderful and I&rsquo;ve had the</p>
<p>honor of being by the Bergs home and</p>
<p>eating what uh someone would think oh</p>
<p>poor thing he don&rsquo;t let me tell you</p>
<p>something it is so delicious when</p>
<p>prepared correctly I mean there is no</p>
<p>suffering at all going over during the</p>
<p>keto Feast at the Berg&rsquo;s house it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>delicious so I hope you do because her</p>
<p>cooking and you know ability to to bring</p>
<p>the best out of keto things I&rsquo;m a great</p>
<p>fan of there&rsquo;s no reason to eat any</p>
<p>other way so Karen we all salute you and</p>
<p>hope to see you on the air soon okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see uh what we have here the quiz</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>we already did quiz question number</p>
<p>three all right Michelle from Facebook</p>
<p>what can cause someone to have low</p>
<p>phosphorus levels how can I fix it</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain um</p>
<p>conditions that can create low</p>
<p>phosphorus you can have a problem with</p>
<p>your parathyroid gland</p>
<p>Also let&rsquo;s say you don&rsquo;t consume a lot</p>
<p>of meat in your diet that could create a</p>
<p>problem but the phosphorus is uh an area</p>
<p>that people don&rsquo;t really even think of</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s needed to create energy in our</p>
<p>bodies ATP adenosine triphosphate so we</p>
<p>need this greatly and there&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re deficient in phosphorus you can</p>
<p>have problems with calcium you need</p>
<p>phosphorus for your bone health too so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I don&rsquo;t even remember if</p>
<p>I ever did a video on phosphorus I think</p>
<p>I have I think I should because it&rsquo;s I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>um kind of a neglected mineral and we we</p>
<p>use a lot of phosphorus in our bodies so</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s great that you brought</p>
<p>that up to remind me of doing a video on</p>
<p>that very good speaking we&rsquo;ve got some</p>
<p>feedback from the off audience Ira from</p>
<p>Facebook Berg&rsquo;s keto Pizza equals</p>
<p>um is that something on one of Karen&rsquo;s</p>
<p>recipe</p>
<p>yeah yeah we make a really good pizza</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>have that recipe quite often it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>good I think I think you&rsquo;d like it and</p>
<p>um we have several versions of it online</p>
<p>and you can check it out and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>if you go to uh my channel YouTube</p>
<p>channel and there&rsquo;s uh Czech channels we</p>
<p>have all the different languages but</p>
<p>then we have a a cooking section uh what</p>
<p>you can do is just find all sorts of</p>
<p>alternative recipes on that channel we</p>
<p>have the videos we put a lot of time</p>
<p>into that we are going to be creating</p>
<p>more uh coming up here soon</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>with a little a little a bigger emphasis</p>
<p>on Quality Foods so it&rsquo;s going to take</p>
<p>it to the next level uh so then I mean</p>
<p>where do you see some of these recipes</p>
<p>that were kind of um formulating it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be exciting okay very good you</p>
<p>know we hear a lot from the audience uh</p>
<p>about concerns over hair loss on keto</p>
<p>and and not to continually pick on Karen</p>
<p>but Karen has this Lion&rsquo;s Mane worth of</p>
<p>Rich hair and you can see Dr Berg is not</p>
<p>doing a comb over I mean that&rsquo;s all the</p>
<p>way to the back of his head and their</p>
<p>hair is very very healthy so anyone who</p>
<p>suggested keto causes hair loss but Dr</p>
<p>Berg how can you talk to people about</p>
<p>maybe doing what you call as you know</p>
<p>pure keto is that the the right word for</p>
<p>it or good keto just look look at</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s diet make sure</p>
<p>um the quality uh Foods their nutrient</p>
<p>dense</p>
<p>because if you do the dirty version of</p>
<p>Keto you&rsquo;re not going to get the level</p>
<p>of nutrients now you might say oh I saw</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no difference between organic</p>
<p>versus commercial food yes there is a</p>
<p>huge difference and I can prove it I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>show it to you I have a lot of data on</p>
<p>this but like we&rsquo;re talking about the</p>
<p>trace minerals right which is hard to</p>
<p>get unless you do shellfish or seafood</p>
<p>also it&rsquo;s you got vitamin D which is</p>
<p>hard to get that and then the B vitamins</p>
<p>all these can lead to a loss of hair</p>
<p>hair problems so</p>
<p>just follow the the healthy version of</p>
<p>the ketogenic diet to to retain your</p>
<p>hair that&rsquo;s the bottom line all right</p>
<p>very good get on that audience and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>get on the next question this one&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>true fall sir uh Dr Burke so there you</p>
<p>go</p>
<p>all right true or false the FDA allows</p>
<p>companies to self-certify new chemicals</p>
<p>into the market which is called</p>
<p>generally recognized as safe</p>
<p>grass</p>
<p>All Right audience is it true or false</p>
<p>yeah true or false yes or no that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re requiring from you on this one uh</p>
<p>this person&rsquo;s moniker is life Coast</p>
<p>coach medical have you ever discussed</p>
<p>the connection uh root canals and poor</p>
<p>health</p>
<p>stuff that happens in your mouth</p>
<p>yeah only when I want to get in trouble</p>
<p>if I talk about that but uh yes root</p>
<p>canals are</p>
<p>you know a lot of dentists use them you</p>
<p>I mean do them a lot and uh</p>
<p>um unless you really understand and know</p>
<p>how to do it correctly you can leave</p>
<p>some bacteria in there and that can uh</p>
<p>develop into an abscess and that can</p>
<p>spread into</p>
<p>throughout the body and create all sorts</p>
<p>of problems with the heart with the</p>
<p>joints</p>
<p>um they found that um</p>
<p>the bacteria in your arteries is very</p>
<p>similar to or if not identical to the</p>
<p>bacteria in your teeth in your mouth so</p>
<p>these root canals can cry deaths</p>
<p>devastating effects I&rsquo;ve read several</p>
<p>books but you know it&rsquo;s um it&rsquo;s just I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t I have to balance some of those</p>
<p>videos with</p>
<p>things</p>
<p>that are more uplifting because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very depressing some of these procedures</p>
<p>and things that can leave a person with</p>
<p>a lot of problems</p>
<p>um but I think dentists should really</p>
<p>think twice about just jumping to a root</p>
<p>canal try to save the the road as much</p>
<p>as possible because um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s too many too many problems that</p>
<p>are related to that underneath the teeth</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t see and they can create</p>
<p>all sorts of issues with arthritis and</p>
<p>heart problems</p>
<p>um yeah absolutely interesting okay just</p>
<p>a couple hundred clicks below Brett who</p>
<p>is in snowy uh Albany is Renee who has</p>
<p>complained that there&rsquo;s been little or</p>
<p>no snow in Pennsylvania this year and</p>
<p>once again that&rsquo;s Karen&rsquo;s alma mater</p>
<p>State as Pennsylvania so a special nod</p>
<p>from her to you Renee and you have your</p>
<p>opportunity for the one question in 30</p>
<p>seconds go</p>
<p>thank you um thanks Dr Berg for having</p>
<p>me and my question is for my son who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>16 years old he&rsquo;s a junior in high</p>
<p>school he&rsquo;s coming off of wrestling</p>
<p>season and now he&rsquo;s really looking to</p>
<p>bulk up and gain weight for football and</p>
<p>the challenge is how to do it</p>
<p>healthfully but within his schedule he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>out of the house for you know 10 or more</p>
<p>hours a day and so he was doing this um</p>
<p>Weight Gainer shake and it was like 1500</p>
<p>calories a nice quick hit but what was</p>
<p>it loaded with maltodextrin sugar and my</p>
<p>husband and I are like no you have to</p>
<p>get off that but he&rsquo;s well then what</p>
<p>what am I going to eat how am I going to</p>
<p>get in all these calories to gain this</p>
<p>weight you know with my schedule so just</p>
<p>would love to your input on what type of</p>
<p>eating plan me as the mom I&rsquo;m kind of</p>
<p>like tasked with this so I would love</p>
<p>your</p>
<p>well I wish I I um I&rsquo;m a wrestler I love</p>
<p>wrestling I watch wrestling a lot of it</p>
<p>and so if I could only go back in time I</p>
<p>would have done something differently</p>
<p>um yeah I I did the worst of the worst</p>
<p>and of course you know you&rsquo;re starving</p>
<p>to try to make Wade and then you pick</p>
<p>out I mean it just messes you up it</p>
<p>actually stunted my growth I&rsquo;m only six</p>
<p>two I mean my dad&rsquo;s six five my</p>
<p>brother&rsquo;s six</p>
<p>seven I think so um I&rsquo;m only six two so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty short but here&rsquo;s what here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I would recommend I would recommend</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do the protein shake stuff I would</p>
<p>do real food but just large quantities</p>
<p>of calories and just make sure that you</p>
<p>have the huge salads and for him because</p>
<p>his metabolism is probably so High</p>
<p>um he may need to do you know some sweet</p>
<p>potato uh maybe he does some fruit</p>
<p>um you know healthy healthy for berries</p>
<p>and stuff like that</p>
<p>um but even some of the other fruits I</p>
<p>think for someone like that with a</p>
<p>metabolism he might need to do that and</p>
<p>then more fat too so like these huge</p>
<p>meals and uh he might need just to do</p>
<p>three of those but if you could just</p>
<p>avoid the snacks that would be good</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and then do a lot of weight training and</p>
<p>the other thing I would mention as far</p>
<p>as a wrestler goes um the workouts</p>
<p>training schedule I used to work out</p>
<p>twice a day that was a big mistake I</p>
<p>would just do once a day and try to have</p>
<p>a day off on the weekends because</p>
<p>um that recovery will keep keep the</p>
<p>endurance and keep his repair up</p>
<p>throughout the season and don&rsquo;t over</p>
<p>train because that&rsquo;s what messes you up</p>
<p>I mean he would have such an the unfair</p>
<p>advantage against any competitor if he</p>
<p>actually got the diet straightened out</p>
<p>with his energy level and his endurance</p>
<p>which you need as a wrestler and the</p>
<p>repair</p>
<p>um especially at the end of the season</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s like the unfair Advantage just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t tell anyone this information so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure this is not broadly promoted</p>
<p>but yeah I would just do huge amounts um</p>
<p>and um as much as you can consume to try</p>
<p>to keep the weight up but it is a</p>
<p>situation I had I ran into the same</p>
<p>thing and I didn&rsquo;t know that I would be</p>
<p>doing all the powders and the</p>
<p>maltodextrin and I was wondering why I</p>
<p>got so tired and um I don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>how I got got through a match</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s great and I</p>
<p>sorry I&rsquo;m and I was going to say that</p>
<p>many of you or most of you I know that</p>
<p>the show is is recorded So after the</p>
<p>fact when you tell your son you know you</p>
<p>should do something different he&rsquo;ll say</p>
<p>who says sitting down and replay this</p>
<p>session which will I&rsquo;m sure go a long</p>
<p>way uh to convincing them to have a</p>
<p>different approach to great health and</p>
<p>strength and all that Renee thank you so</p>
<p>much uh for your a quick question and</p>
<p>yeah shout out to Renee and Brett and</p>
<p>Mary for being I think about the best</p>
<p>green room participants we&rsquo;ve had all</p>
<p>day no I&rsquo;m scared no just a terrific for</p>
<p>uh as a historical marker of exactly how</p>
<p>to do it okay let&rsquo;s go back</p>
<p>um to social media</p>
<p>uh Quinn from YouTube is it safe to take</p>
<p>bile salts and tatka if you have</p>
<p>gastritis and acid reflux</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good question because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>30 of the time when you have acid reflux</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also reflexing bile</p>
<p>so we know probably you&rsquo;re deficient in</p>
<p>BIO but we also know that that bile is a</p>
<p>detergent which can irritate the lining</p>
<p>of inflamed stomach and your esophagus</p>
<p>so it would be I would watch my uh</p>
<p>videos on I think it&rsquo;s called bile</p>
<p>reflux or bile regurgitation and just</p>
<p>get more information on that you have to</p>
<p>test the waters to see how you feel if</p>
<p>you feel better then do it if you feel</p>
<p>worse than you know you&rsquo;re not on the</p>
<p>right track but</p>
<p>um when you&rsquo;re trying to fix this reflux</p>
<p>thing</p>
<p>um you know you always start out with uh</p>
<p>the correct diet</p>
<p>okay did that fix everything no okay</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll add the betaine hydrochloride oh I</p>
<p>needed I need some more help maybe you</p>
<p>need to add the bile salts maybe you</p>
<p>need to add B1 to help the vagus nerve</p>
<p>connection to that valve the valves are</p>
<p>autonomic nervous system innervated so</p>
<p>that B1 is going to be necessary to help</p>
<p>keep the the valve shut</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but very good question you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have to</p>
<p>I mean you could do a scope but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>too invasive I would just</p>
<p>try to take some see if you feel better</p>
<p>or worse and then you know for sure but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>getting that digestive system squared</p>
<p>away is like</p>
<p>sometimes a bit complex</p>
<p>all right Quinn will we wish you well on</p>
<p>that sounds like you&rsquo;re on the right</p>
<p>track trying to take care of yourself</p>
<p>and our one true false or question for</p>
<p>the day asked the FDA allows companies</p>
<p>to self-certify new chemicals in the</p>
<p>market which are is called what an</p>
<p>acronym or generally uh required as safe</p>
<p>I was going to say a euphemism gross and</p>
<p>the audience uh let me go back to that</p>
<p>sorry this thing flies by so quickly</p>
<p>oh I&rsquo;m embarrassed now I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>find it here it is 97 of our respondents</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s true at three percent only</p>
<p>three percent say it&rsquo;s false</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s totally true it&rsquo;s like um</p>
<p>you think of this uh cross</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s not a certification but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like wow yeah this chemical is</p>
<p>generally recognized as safe I like that</p>
<p>word generally but not all the time</p>
<p>um the point is that they allow industry</p>
<p>to certify themselves</p>
<p>this is something new I just finally I</p>
<p>recently found out about and I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>you got to be kidding me I thought in my</p>
<p>mind all these chemicals like the 10 10</p>
<p>000 chemicals that are in our food</p>
<p>supply I thought it was the FDA that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>supposed to regulate them but it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>loophole</p>
<p>a loophole that industry uses to</p>
<p>self-certified I think there could</p>
<p>possibly be a bias there Steve what do</p>
<p>you think</p>
<p>well I I think of the fox guarding the</p>
<p>hen house frankly</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right uh and of course the UPS</p>
<p>guy is right outside so the dog is</p>
<p>barking so I&rsquo;m just letting you know in</p>
<p>advance that&rsquo;s right old uh Charlie has</p>
<p>to have this moment it&rsquo;s 15 seconds of</p>
<p>Fame and there it is all right final</p>
<p>question for today is not a true false</p>
<p>it is going to require some real thought</p>
<p>processes Dr Berg there it is</p>
<p>okay why is selenium the most important</p>
<p>Trace mineral for hypothyroidism</p>
<p>okay climb on that folks</p>
<p>um oh that&rsquo;s just interesting little lit</p>
<p>from it&rsquo;s not interesting it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>prevalent little it from YouTube please</p>
<p>help me address sleep apnea issues</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s another interesting</p>
<p>um topic as it relates to CO2</p>
<p>now if you could train your body to</p>
<p>start breathing through your nose</p>
<p>um you you probably will start getting</p>
<p>more oxygen</p>
<p>um if you ever notice even when people</p>
<p>they snore</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>they snore through the back of the</p>
<p>throat try to snore just by if you try</p>
<p>to breathe through your nose and try to</p>
<p>mimic snoring it&rsquo;s really hard to do</p>
<p>that unless there&rsquo;s a sinus congestion</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>you need to definitely do keto</p>
<p>intermittent fasting to lose weight if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some fat around your throat that</p>
<p>could be can just be a</p>
<p>a structural thing</p>
<p>but if that&rsquo;s not the situation you need</p>
<p>to train your body to nose breathing and</p>
<p>keep your mouth shut right Steve the key</p>
<p>is keeping your mouth shut oh that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>tough one for me</p>
<p>and uh because you get in trouble when</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t keep your mouth shut now</p>
<p>breathe through your nose and what</p>
<p>happens is you&rsquo;ll get more oxygen</p>
<p>to your tissues 20 percent more oxygen</p>
<p>when you breathe through your nose when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sleeping and um that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all about versus just trying to put a</p>
<p>mask on your face and pump more air into</p>
<p>your body which is um doesn&rsquo;t always get</p>
<p>the oxygen in there and your body&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always gasping for air so you want to</p>
<p>train your your respiratory Pathways and</p>
<p>your lungs and build those up</p>
<p>um and watch my videos on on the sinus</p>
<p>because it could be simple a simple</p>
<p>sinus inflammatory problem that you can</p>
<p>solve with a number of Remedies and a</p>
<p>change of diet but you know I had We</p>
<p>rescued these pigs that were literally</p>
<p>so obese that um I&rsquo;ll I&rsquo;ll put a video</p>
<p>on it I mean they were just you talk</p>
<p>about sleep apnea all these pigs snored</p>
<p>because they could barely breathe barely</p>
<p>walk now no sound no snoring when</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re sleeping they&rsquo;re running around</p>
<p>I think each one of them lost at least</p>
<p>50 pounds each so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you got to put put even put your pigs on</p>
<p>a diet well they look really funny with</p>
<p>a CPAP mask on too but you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to do it together yeah I had a</p>
<p>hard time putting them on on them but</p>
<p>you know here you go well listen if you</p>
<p>want to see that video and more here&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great suggestion get Dr Berg&rsquo;s free uh</p>
<p>app and you can get it for uh iOS Apple</p>
<p>you know iPhones and also uh for any of</p>
<p>the Google stuff so that&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>resource at your fingertips to find out</p>
<p>exactly what is going on in the world of</p>
<p>Dr Berg&rsquo;s thousands of videos and and I</p>
<p>understand Dr Berg gets very organized</p>
<p>right so it may be a better experience</p>
<p>than YouTube sometimes because you can</p>
<p>really uh kind of search for something</p>
<p>and find it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right absolutely</p>
<p>okay and then we love all our Stateside</p>
<p>folks but that we have people around the</p>
<p>world as you&rsquo;ve heard from our shout</p>
<p>outs and just letting them know that Dr</p>
<p>Berg is always working in his team on</p>
<p>making products available more easily</p>
<p>and affordably internationally so I</p>
<p>guess there&rsquo;s a link in there somewhere</p>
<p>at the bottom on the side here it tells</p>
<p>you how to do that if you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Slovakia or wherever the heck you are</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see why don&rsquo;t we wrap things</p>
<p>up uh with another question from social</p>
<p>media uh let&rsquo;s see Quinn from YouTube is</p>
<p>it safe to take bile salts oh no I</p>
<p>already did that one excuse me oh here</p>
<p>we go Ada from Facebook do you have any</p>
<p>suggestions for getting rid of freckles</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re cute but what do you</p>
<p>think doc</p>
<p>yeah well that&rsquo;s um that&rsquo;s a difficult</p>
<p>one</p>
<p>um I I think um some of that is genetics</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can get rid of</p>
<p>actual freckles</p>
<p>um I do know that when you&rsquo;re on the sun</p>
<p>they they&rsquo;re more emphasized</p>
<p>um but um</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re taught when you have liver</p>
<p>spots and aging spots that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>completely different thing</p>
<p>um niacin works on works well on that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all sorts of great creams with</p>
<p>antioxidants I think I think if you get</p>
<p>spots on your face the best thing to</p>
<p>ensure is more antioxidants in the diet</p>
<p>from just eating the healthy foods that</p>
<p>I recommend and doing intermittent</p>
<p>fasting that way of the antioxidants to</p>
<p>um keep the skin nice and healthy and</p>
<p>glowing wonderful glowing skin terrific</p>
<p>by the way we do have to answer the</p>
<p>final question today which asked why is</p>
<p>selenium the most important Trace</p>
<p>mineral mineral for hypothyroidism and</p>
<p>the audience is split up as usual eighty</p>
<p>percent of our respondents say selenium</p>
<p>transfers key Force to t3s 10 say it</p>
<p>improves thyroid function and 10 say it</p>
<p>helps with hormone production how are</p>
<p>they doing doc</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all doing great because it does</p>
<p>all those and it also since 90 of all</p>
<p>hypothyroidism is Hashimoto&rsquo;s which</p>
<p>involves antibodies against your own</p>
<p>your thyroid apparently selenium has the</p>
<p>ability to lower these antibodies</p>
<p>directly which is very very</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>um an interesting effect plus it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>precursor for a glutathione which is the</p>
<p>most powerful antioxidant in the body</p>
<p>that gets rid of some of the byproducts</p>
<p>that are created when you have</p>
<p>autoimmune diseases especially of the</p>
<p>thyroid like like um</p>
<p>hydrogen peroxide so um it does a lot</p>
<p>and for your for Hashimoto&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more important than iodine hands down so</p>
<p>um where do you get it red meat</p>
<p>shellfish seaweed things like that but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an important mineral that we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to neglect and it&rsquo;s also good for</p>
<p>the liver it actually can lower liver</p>
<p>enzymes help decrease fibrosis in your</p>
<p>liver it can help decrease the um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um fatty liver and so and even reduce</p>
<p>the risk of getting cancer too in your</p>
<p>liver so it does a lot</p>
<p>all right terrific well anyway I joined</p>
<p>the audience and and uh saying hello to</p>
<p>Karen and we can&rsquo;t wait to see her on</p>
<p>the air and divulge some of her uh great</p>
<p>health</p>
<p>approaches as well which of course mimic</p>
<p>Dr Bergs very closely and let&rsquo;s see what</p>
<p>else we we have uh 20 seconds left Dr</p>
<p>Berg any closing thoughts</p>
<p>I just just uh um I have some really</p>
<p>really fascinating videos this week I</p>

<p>before but uh this week is different</p>
