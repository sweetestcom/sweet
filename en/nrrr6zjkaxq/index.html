Transcript ﻿so you want to do fasting for fear related disorders i&amp;rsquo;m talking about anxiety panic attacks ptsd post traumatic stress disorder and phobias now fear is an emotion that helps you survive but what happens when our body becomes in a chronic state of fear and how does that influence our bodies not good and the question is what can we do about it well one of the most powerful things you can do is you can do fasting there are many many things that fasting can do for the brain for your immune system for your cognitive function and for your mood now when i say mood i&amp;rsquo;m talking about elevating your mood from a chronic state of anxiety or fear to a much higher state and now there&amp;rsquo;s several mechanisms behind why this works but fasting is also a survival mechanism that helps you survive in times of danger so it tends to counter this fear of motion especially supporting your adrenal glands also a little structure in your brain called the amygdala which is very similar to the adrenals but for the brain and so they found the amygdala in the brain has everything to do with fear and then you have something called the sympathetic nervous system as in the flight or fight mechanism and the location of that is inside your adrenal glands because there&amp;rsquo;s two parts you have an outside and inside it&amp;rsquo;s on the inside and also in all of the mid back nerves you have the sympathetic nervous system so there&amp;rsquo;s studies that show that fasting helps your adrenal glands your sympathetic nervous system which is part of the autonomic nervous system and also it can help your amygdala so if you&amp;rsquo;re stuck in this fear band whether it&amp;rsquo;s a low-level fear or a level fear like in panic attacks or whatever you can do fasting to pull yourself out so fasting will improve your mood it improves gaba which is a neurotransmitter that makes you calm it will improve dopamine which helps increase pleasure which then counters stress hormones like cortisol and fasting can actually reduce cortisol directly and reduces that flat or fight mechanism as improving sympathetic nervous system dominance and so if you&amp;rsquo;re new to my channel and you really want to start out doing something very very easy just start doing intermittent fasting even without changing your diet okay as a step one then you&amp;rsquo;re going to find that it&amp;rsquo;s going to be easier to change your diet so then you can start eliminating carbs okay that&amp;rsquo;s called keto i put a link down below of that plan and it&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through this step by step but the main thing with fasting is you don&amp;rsquo;t want to eat if you&amp;rsquo;re not hungry so many people eat breakfast as a routine thing thinking that it&amp;rsquo;s a healthy thing to do even though they&amp;rsquo;re not hungry if you&amp;rsquo;re not hungry don&amp;rsquo;t eat especially in the morning instead do two meals a day one at lunch one at dinner make sure you don&amp;rsquo;t have anything between those meals then you&amp;rsquo;re doing intermittent fasting very very simple that will give you 18 hours of fasting from your last meal to your first meal you&amp;rsquo;re going to start seeing some magical things happen when you fast for 18 hours now there&amp;rsquo;s many things you can do to enhance this you can start adding mct oil which your brain will love you can start adding b vitamins in the form of nutritional yeast especially vitamin b1 that&amp;rsquo;s going to help a lot and then also adding more fat to the meals to make you more satisfied so you can go longer not to mention most of your brain is made of the fat and so you&amp;rsquo;re supporting your brain just from adding that fat all

disorders i&rsquo;m talking about anxiety panic attacks  </p><p>ptsd post traumatic stress disorder and phobias 
now fear is an emotion that helps you survive but  </p><p>what happens when our body becomes in a chronic 
state of fear and how does that influence our  </p><p>bodies not good and the question is what can 
we do about it well one of the most powerful  </p><p>things you can do is you can do fasting there are 
many many things that fasting can do for the brain  </p><p>for your immune system for your cognitive function 
and for your mood now when i say mood i&rsquo;m talking  </p><p>about elevating your mood from a chronic state 
of anxiety or fear to a much higher state and  </p><p>now there&rsquo;s several mechanisms behind why this 
works but fasting is also a survival mechanism  </p><p>that helps you survive in times of danger so it 
tends to counter this fear of motion especially  </p><p>supporting your adrenal glands also a little 
structure in your brain called the amygdala  </p><p>which is very similar to the adrenals but for the 
brain and so they found the amygdala in the brain  </p><p>has everything to do with fear and then you have 
something called the sympathetic nervous system  </p><p>as in the flight or fight mechanism and the 
location of that is inside your adrenal glands  </p><p>because there&rsquo;s two parts you have an outside and 
inside it&rsquo;s on the inside and also in all of the  </p><p>mid back nerves you have the sympathetic nervous 
system so there&rsquo;s studies that show that fasting  </p><p>helps your adrenal glands your sympathetic nervous 
system which is part of the autonomic nervous  </p><p>system and also it can help your amygdala so if 
you&rsquo;re stuck in this fear band whether it&rsquo;s a  </p><p>low-level fear or a level fear 
like in panic attacks or whatever  </p><p>you can do fasting to pull yourself out so fasting 
will improve your mood it improves gaba which is  </p><p>a neurotransmitter that makes you calm it will 
improve dopamine which helps increase pleasure  </p><p>which then counters stress hormones like cortisol 
and fasting can actually reduce cortisol directly  </p><p>and reduces that flat or fight mechanism 
as improving sympathetic nervous system  </p><p>dominance and so if you&rsquo;re new to my channel and 
you really want to start out doing something very  </p><p>very easy just start doing intermittent fasting 
even without changing your diet okay as a step one  </p><p>then you&rsquo;re going to find that it&rsquo;s going to be 
easier to change your diet so then you can start  </p><p>eliminating carbs okay that&rsquo;s called keto i put 
a link down below of that plan and it&rsquo;ll walk you  </p><p>through this step by step but the main thing with 
fasting is you don&rsquo;t want to eat if you&rsquo;re not  </p><p>hungry so many people eat breakfast as a routine 
thing thinking that it&rsquo;s a healthy thing to do  </p><p>even though they&rsquo;re not hungry if you&rsquo;re not 
hungry don&rsquo;t eat especially in the morning instead  </p><p>do two meals a day one at lunch one at dinner make 
sure you don&rsquo;t have anything between those meals  </p><p>then you&rsquo;re doing intermittent fasting very very 
simple that will give you 18 hours of fasting  </p><p>from your last meal to your first meal you&rsquo;re 
going to start seeing some magical things happen  </p><p>when you fast for 18 hours now there&rsquo;s many things 
you can do to enhance this you can start adding  </p><p>mct oil which your brain will love you can start 
adding b vitamins in the form of nutritional yeast  </p><p>especially vitamin b1 that&rsquo;s going to help a 
lot and then also adding more fat to the meals  </p><p>to make you more satisfied so you can go longer 
not to mention most of your brain is made of the  </p><p>fat and so you&rsquo;re supporting your brain just from 
adding that fat all right there you have it thanks  </p><p>for watching and definitely click the program down 
below so you can get started and do it correctly  </p><p>hey before you go if you&rsquo;re benefiting 
from any of my content i would love  </p><p>to hear about your success story 
please share it in the link down below</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
