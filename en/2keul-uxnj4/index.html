Berg here in this video I want to discuss probably one of the most important body systems that you have it&amp;rsquo;s the digestive system ok so you have 33 feet of intestines and that&amp;rsquo;s a like you can mention a water hose in your backyard it&amp;rsquo;s a very long hose and it&amp;rsquo;s all wrapped around and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of things that happen from start to finish so let&amp;rsquo;s just time to take from the top you&amp;rsquo;ve got the stomach here which normally what&amp;rsquo;s interesting about the stomach is that people don&amp;rsquo;t realize how acid the stomach should be if you understand pH neutral is 7 and it goes down to be more acid and higher to be more alkaline for every number let&amp;rsquo;s say we go from 7 to 6 going down that&amp;rsquo;s 10 times more acid so it it compounds so you can imagine a pH of 1 to 3 that is super super acidic okay that&amp;rsquo;s what the stomach should be normally and the stomach actually helps you release the stomach releases the acid triggers enzymes that then help you break down protein so they have very powerful proto lytic enzymes so if there&amp;rsquo;s a problem with the valve on the top of the stomach then that enzyme gets up into the esophagus they can literally digest your tissues up into your throat so it&amp;rsquo;s that powerful it helps you absorb minerals so if you don&amp;rsquo;t have the right acid in your stomach you can&amp;rsquo;t absorb like iron you become anemic like even b12 will not be absorbing either and that&amp;rsquo;s another type of anemia it also kills microbes because microbes have a hard time living in that acid and either even h pylori which is a very nasty bacteria that causes ulcers and other issues if your stomach is very acidic that thing will stay in a mission or not invade your tissues but if the stomach is not asked enough it will not release these to other organs called the pancreas and the gallbladder so what controls a pancreas in and the gallbladder is really the pH of the stomach pH of that stomach also controls the valve of the top of the stomach so without that stomach being acidic you you can get GERD acid reflux and then people take any acids which is the exact opposite but what happens if you you can&amp;rsquo;t release the pancreas now we don&amp;rsquo;t we don&amp;rsquo;t get the release of enzymes so the pancreas has all these different enzymes for carbohydrates proteins fats collagen you name it and it&amp;rsquo;s constantly released depending on which you eat so signals from your mouth are telling the pancreas what to release and what to create when you start eating so so we have this enzyme breakdown and then we have the gallbladder release bile bile helps you break down fats break down fat so you can absorb fat side with vitamins vitamin A D and K and then also help you it helps you detoxify certain chemicals in the liver so without the gallbladder we can&amp;rsquo;t get that full detox let these two work together and then the bile is alkalyn so it helps to neutralize this incredibly strong acid coming into the small intestine so if we didn&amp;rsquo;t have the bile we couldn&amp;rsquo;t neutralize that and you would get an ulcer in your small intestine and then we have the pancreas that also makes this other alkaline fluid called bicarbonate that helps neutralize the acid at this point too so we go from a strong acid to a very alkaline fluid inside the small intestine so the small intestine is alkaline okay and it&amp;rsquo;s so funny when people say well you need to be alkaline well what part of the body you&amp;rsquo;re talking about because your stomach better not the alkaline definitely the small intestine should be alkaline but the large intestine should be acidic so you have different PHS so now in the small intestine this is where 90% of the digestion occurs and you have helped though you have microbes you have a lot of microbes in fact in your body you have a thousand trillion bacteria or microbes in your body outside and inside that&amp;rsquo;s a thousand trillion that&amp;rsquo;s a lot you only have a hundred trillion cells so these bacteria or these microbes have are ten times more than your own self so if you take a body it&amp;rsquo;s mostly microbes so but they&amp;rsquo;re very small so you don&amp;rsquo;t there&amp;rsquo;s like probably about three or four maybe five pounds of microbes per body weight but the microbes basically help you break down your food and help so you can absorb the food there&amp;rsquo;s thousands tens of thousands of different strains of microbes in your gut you have good bacteria and then you have bad bacteria they&amp;rsquo;re called pathogenic now antibiotics destroy both good and bad bacteria what&amp;rsquo;s happening now is the bad bacteria is adapting to the antibiotics and they&amp;rsquo;re becoming more resistant so now the antibiotics don&amp;rsquo;t work but the good news is this that the good bacteria also adapts to the antibiotics if it didn&amp;rsquo;t you&amp;rsquo;d be probably be dead by now so your microbes are very intelligent and they have developed new strategies of surviving so if you take a let&amp;rsquo;s say someone comes in your house and they try to steal something and then you take a bat and you whack them right well the next time they come in their house they&amp;rsquo;re they wear a helmet so these microbes basically have different ways of adapting to survive one of the interesting strategies some of these microbes pulled off is they basically can mimic and adapt to your vitamin D receptors they mimic the vitamin D receptor so when your vitamin D goes into the wrong receptor it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work anymore so it&amp;rsquo;s just as fascinated because you need vitamin D for the immune system so there&amp;rsquo;s all these different types of strategies that use one type of micro adapted without a cell wall so they can move into the joints and then they can travel and they can do this and they can hide so your immune system can&amp;rsquo;t detect them very intelligent sneaky little guys but thank goodness that our good bacteria also adapt so we have 90% of the nutrient nutrition absorption occurs at this level with other another thing that&amp;rsquo;s interesting about this is that you have something called the enteric nervous system so you have the sympathetic which is a flight-or-fight that&amp;rsquo;s like the stress nervous system and then we have the parasympathetic which is part of the rest and digest which controls a lot of this - that&amp;rsquo;s that&amp;rsquo;s kind of like the opposite of the stress nervous system but then you have the enteric which controls like all this intestines and the peristalsis the pumping action of the whole thing and if years someone cut your spinal column for example you could this will still work because it&amp;rsquo;s an independent nervous system it can work on its own that&amp;rsquo;s what I call the second brain but the challenge is that a lot of the information that happens down here is transmitted up to the brain so whatever&amp;rsquo;s going on your digestion can affect your mood you could it could have create depression anxiety and a lot of tension in your neck and even a lot of headaches so it&amp;rsquo;s interesting how the digestion can affect your mood and also your mood could affect your digestion both ways because it&amp;rsquo;s a second brain the bacteria also makes a lot of B vitamins so what happens when I see people with vitamin B deficiencies it&amp;rsquo;s not because they&amp;rsquo;re not consuming them is because they don&amp;rsquo;t have the microbes or they they don&amp;rsquo;t have the good digestive system to absorb those vitamin B over those B vitamins or they they make them but they can&amp;rsquo;t get absorbed because the surface lining of the intestines is damaged so I&amp;rsquo;ll get to that in a little bit but what these microbes eat or consume is fiber preferably when we want to feed them a vegetable fiber and they turn it into something called butyrate which is a type of acid that then will feed the colon cells so it&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s interesting these microbes actually exchange with us we help them they we provide a house and they give us food as well so that&amp;rsquo;s what happens in the small intestine and the large intestine is mainly responsible for reabsorption of water and minerals but this is where you have the highest concentration of microbes so without the microbes here you&amp;rsquo;ll get diarrhea okay the little little roots that occur in a small intestine are called little villi they&amp;rsquo;re upside down roots and that&amp;rsquo;s where it absorbs and you have like a million bacteria per millimeter like a real small surface area there&amp;rsquo;s a so many compacted microbes in there that are supposed to help you absorb and write when it gets absorbed it goes right into the lymphatic system 80% of your lymphatic system is surrounding your intestines so 85% of your immune system is really connected to your gut and it&amp;rsquo;s there and it&amp;rsquo;s kind of like immigration to give these microbes a stamp of approval or not approval to not let them through so there&amp;rsquo;s a barrier there that resists microbes that are unfriendly so when you destroy these little so-called villi or little roots you get this small surface area where you now you can&amp;rsquo;t you lose your immigration so now my unfriendly microbes can innervate and start to go into the lymphatic system and create health for the immune system that&amp;rsquo;s where you get autoimmune diseases that&amp;rsquo;s where the immune system you know starts giving the wrong information and attacking it&amp;rsquo;s not creating antibodies for your own tissue it&amp;rsquo;s like self attack so you have a lot of inflammatory conditions that originated from this lining that you lose the structure okay so there&amp;rsquo;s a couple things that you can do number one you have to build up the flora and I think the best way is to take something called effective microbes I&amp;rsquo;ll put a link down there I&amp;rsquo;m not affiliated I don&amp;rsquo;t get any Commission&amp;rsquo;s or anything but I&amp;rsquo;ll put a link down there of effective microbes and you can check it out but effective microbes is the symbiotic a group of microbes that basically all live on each other so they kind of work together and you want to take very very very small amounts starting out because if you have too many unfriendly strains you can create a war so you want to take them right before you go to bed and then they&amp;rsquo;ll grow in your system over a period of time so effective microbes are very important and then to retrain your immune system your t-cells and start to put back that immune system I recommend something called colostrum and again I&amp;rsquo;ll put a link down there below I&amp;rsquo;m not affiliated with any companies but this is a really good thing too your immune system and it&amp;rsquo;s really really good for rheumatoid arthritis it&amp;rsquo;s good for inflammation it&amp;rsquo;s good for autoimmune it&amp;rsquo;s good for allergies it&amp;rsquo;s really good for sinus mucus it&amp;rsquo;s good for any type of inflammatory condition but I will say when you take this start off taking very small amounts maybe 1/4 of a teaspoon before bed why because if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a good immune system you&amp;rsquo;re going to stir up a hornet&amp;rsquo;s nest and you&amp;rsquo;re gonna get more mucus that it&amp;rsquo;s gonna kick in there so you always want to start very small over a gradual period of time to start introducing these 2 things so and I also recommend al glutamine - those three are really good to start building up the intestinal wall and then over time you&amp;rsquo;ll start getting your immune system back ok so I hope that kind of gave you a summary of how this digestive system works and put your comments below'>

that the good bacteria also adapts to the antibiotics if it didn&amp;rsquo;t you&amp;rsquo;d be probably be dead by now so your microbes are very intelligent and they have developed new strategies of surviving so if you take a let&amp;rsquo;s say someone comes in your house and they try to steal something and then you take a bat and you whack them right well the next time they come in their house they&amp;rsquo;re they wear a helmet so these microbes basically have different ways of adapting to survive one of the interesting strategies some of these microbes pulled off is they basically can mimic and adapt to your vitamin D receptors they mimic the vitamin D receptor so when your vitamin D goes into the wrong receptor it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work anymore so it&amp;rsquo;s just as fascinated because you need vitamin D for the immune system so there&amp;rsquo;s all these different types of strategies that use one type of micro adapted without a cell wall so they can move into the joints and then they can travel and they can do this and they can hide so your immune system can&amp;rsquo;t detect them very intelligent sneaky little guys but thank goodness that our good bacteria also adapt so we have 90% of the nutrient nutrition absorption occurs at this level with other another thing that&amp;rsquo;s interesting about this is that you have something called the enteric nervous system so you have the sympathetic which is a flight-or-fight that&amp;rsquo;s like the stress nervous system and then we have the parasympathetic which is part of the rest and digest which controls a lot of this - that&amp;rsquo;s that&amp;rsquo;s kind of like the opposite of the stress nervous system but then you have the enteric which controls like all this intestines and the peristalsis the pumping action of the whole thing and if years someone cut your spinal column for example you could this will still work because it&amp;rsquo;s an independent nervous system it can work on its own that&amp;rsquo;s what I call the second brain but the challenge is that a lot of the information that happens down here is transmitted up to the brain so whatever&amp;rsquo;s going on your digestion can affect your mood you could it could have create depression anxiety and a lot of tension in your neck and even a lot of headaches so it&amp;rsquo;s interesting how the digestion can affect your mood and also your mood could affect your digestion both ways because it&amp;rsquo;s a second brain the bacteria also makes a lot of B vitamins so what happens when I see people with vitamin B deficiencies it&amp;rsquo;s not because they&amp;rsquo;re not consuming them is because they don&amp;rsquo;t have the microbes or they they don&amp;rsquo;t have the good digestive system to absorb those vitamin B over those B vitamins or they they make them but they can&amp;rsquo;t get absorbed because the surface lining of the intestines is damaged so I&amp;rsquo;ll get to that in a little bit but what these microbes eat or consume is fiber preferably when we want to feed them a vegetable fiber and they turn it into something called butyrate which is a type of acid that then will feed the colon cells so it&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s interesting these microbes actually exchange with us we help them they we provide a house and they give us food as well so that&amp;rsquo;s what happens in the small intestine and the large intestine is mainly responsible for reabsorption of water and minerals but this is where you have the highest concentration of microbes so without the microbes here you&amp;rsquo;ll get diarrhea okay the little little roots that occur in a small intestine are called little villi they&amp;rsquo;re upside down roots and that&amp;rsquo;s where it absorbs and you have like a million bacteria per millimeter like a real small surface area there&amp;rsquo;s a so many compacted microbes in there that are supposed to help you absorb and write when it gets absorbed it goes right into the lymphatic system 80% of your lymphatic system is surrounding your intestines so 85% of your immune system is really connected to your gut and it&amp;rsquo;s there and it&amp;rsquo;s kind of like immigration to give these microbes a stamp of approval or not approval to not let them through so there&amp;rsquo;s a barrier there that resists microbes that are unfriendly so when you destroy these little so-called villi or little roots you get this small surface area where you now you can&amp;rsquo;t you lose your immigration so now my unfriendly microbes can innervate and start to go into the lymphatic system and create health for the immune system that&amp;rsquo;s where you get autoimmune diseases that&amp;rsquo;s where the immune system you know starts giving the wrong information and attacking it&amp;rsquo;s not creating antibodies for your own tissue it&amp;rsquo;s like self attack so you have a lot of inflammatory conditions that originated from this lining that you lose the structure okay so there&amp;rsquo;s a couple things that you can do number one you have to build up the flora and I think the best way is to take something called effective microbes I&amp;rsquo;ll put a link down there I&amp;rsquo;m not affiliated I don&amp;rsquo;t get any Commission&amp;rsquo;s or anything but I&amp;rsquo;ll put a link down there of effective microbes and you can check it out but effective microbes is the symbiotic a group of microbes that basically all live on each other so they kind of work together and you want to take very very very small amounts starting out because if you have too many unfriendly strains you can create a war so you want to take them right before you go to bed and then they&amp;rsquo;ll grow in your system over a period of time so effective microbes are very important and then to retrain your immune system your t-cells and start to put back that immune system I recommend something called colostrum and again I&amp;rsquo;ll put a link down there below I&amp;rsquo;m not affiliated with any companies but this is a really good thing too your immune system and it&amp;rsquo;s really really good for rheumatoid arthritis it&amp;rsquo;s good for inflammation it&amp;rsquo;s good for autoimmune it&amp;rsquo;s good for allergies it&amp;rsquo;s really good for sinus mucus it&amp;rsquo;s good for any type of inflammatory condition but I will say when you take this start off taking very small amounts maybe 1/4 of a teaspoon before bed why because if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a good immune system you&amp;rsquo;re going to stir up a hornet&amp;rsquo;s nest and you&amp;rsquo;re gonna get more mucus that it&amp;rsquo;s gonna kick in there so you always want to start very small over a gradual period of time to start introducing these 2 things so and I also recommend al glutamine - those three are really good to start building up the intestinal wall and then over time you&amp;rsquo;ll start getting your immune system back ok so I hope that kind of gave you a summary of how this digestive system works and put your comments below">

<p>﻿hey guys dr. Berg here in this video I want to 
discuss probably one of the most important body  </p>
<p>systems that you have it&rsquo;s the digestive system 
ok so you have 33 feet of intestines and that&rsquo;s a  </p>
<p>like you can mention a water hose in your backyard 
it&rsquo;s a very long hose and it&rsquo;s all wrapped around  </p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of things that happen from start 
to finish so let&rsquo;s just time to take from the top  </p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got the stomach here which normally what&rsquo;s 
interesting about the stomach is that people don&rsquo;t  </p>
<p>realize how acid the stomach should be if you 
understand pH neutral is 7 and it goes down to  </p>
<p>be more acid and higher to be more alkaline for 
every number let&rsquo;s say we go from 7 to 6 going  </p>
<p>down that&rsquo;s 10 times more acid so it it compounds 
so you can imagine a pH of 1 to 3 that is super  </p>
<p>super acidic okay that&rsquo;s what the stomach should 
be normally and the stomach actually helps you  </p>
<p>release the stomach releases the acid triggers 
enzymes that then help you break down protein so  </p>
<p>they have very powerful proto lytic enzymes so 
if there&rsquo;s a problem with the valve on the top  </p>
<p>of the stomach then that enzyme gets up into 
the esophagus they can literally digest your  </p>
<p>tissues up into your throat so it&rsquo;s that powerful 
it helps you absorb minerals so if you don&rsquo;t have  </p>
<p>the right acid in your stomach you can&rsquo;t absorb 
like iron you become anemic like even b12 will  </p>
<p>not be absorbing either and that&rsquo;s another type 
of anemia it also kills microbes because microbes  </p>
<p>have a hard time living in that acid and either 
even h pylori which is a very nasty bacteria that  </p>
<p>causes ulcers and other issues if your stomach is 
very acidic that thing will stay in a mission or  </p>
<p>not invade your tissues but if the stomach is not 
asked enough it will not release these to other  </p>
<p>organs called the pancreas and the gallbladder so 
what controls a pancreas in and the gallbladder  </p>
<p>is really the pH of the stomach pH of that stomach 
also controls the valve of the top of the stomach  </p>
<p>so without that stomach being acidic you you 
can get GERD acid reflux and then people take  </p>
<p>any acids which is the exact opposite but what 
happens if you you can&rsquo;t release the pancreas  </p>
<p>now we don&rsquo;t we don&rsquo;t get the release of enzymes 
so the pancreas has all these different enzymes  </p>
<p>for carbohydrates proteins fats collagen you name 
it and it&rsquo;s constantly released depending on which  </p>
<p>you eat so signals from your mouth are telling 
the pancreas what to release and what to create  </p>
<p>when you start eating so so we have this enzyme 
breakdown and then we have the gallbladder release  </p>
<p>bile bile helps you break down fats break down fat 
so you can absorb fat side with vitamins vitamin  </p>
<p>A D and K and then also help you it helps you 
detoxify certain chemicals in the liver so without  </p>
<p>the gallbladder we can&rsquo;t get that full detox 
let these two work together and then the bile is  </p>
<p>alkalyn so it helps to neutralize this incredibly 
strong acid coming into the small intestine so if  </p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have the bile we couldn&rsquo;t neutralize 
that and you would get an ulcer in your small  </p>
<p>intestine and then we have the pancreas that also 
makes this other alkaline fluid called bicarbonate  </p>
<p>that helps neutralize the acid at this point too 
so we go from a strong acid to a very alkaline  </p>
<p>fluid inside the small intestine so the small 
intestine is alkaline okay and it&rsquo;s so funny  </p>
<p>when people say well you need to be alkaline well 
what part of the body you&rsquo;re talking about because  </p>
<p>your stomach better not the alkaline definitely 
the small intestine should be alkaline but the  </p>
<p>large intestine should be acidic so you have 
different PHS so now in the small intestine this  </p>
<p>is where 90% of the digestion occurs and you have 
helped though you have microbes you have a lot of  </p>
<p>microbes in fact in your body you have a thousand 
trillion bacteria or microbes in your body outside  </p>
<p>and inside that&rsquo;s a thousand trillion that&rsquo;s a lot 
you only have a hundred trillion cells so these  </p>
<p>bacteria or these microbes have are ten times 
more than your own self so if you take a body  </p>
<p>it&rsquo;s mostly microbes so but they&rsquo;re very small 
so you don&rsquo;t there&rsquo;s like probably about three  </p>
<p>or four maybe five pounds of microbes per body 
weight but the microbes basically help you break  </p>
<p>down your food and help so you can absorb the food 
there&rsquo;s thousands tens of thousands of different  </p>
<p>strains of microbes in your gut you have good 
bacteria and then you have bad bacteria they&rsquo;re  </p>
<p>called pathogenic now antibiotics destroy both 
good and bad bacteria what&rsquo;s happening now is  </p>
<p>the bad bacteria is adapting to the antibiotics 
and they&rsquo;re becoming more resistant so now the  </p>
<p>antibiotics don&rsquo;t work but the good news is 
this that the good bacteria also adapts to the  </p>
<p>antibiotics if it didn&rsquo;t you&rsquo;d be probably be dead 
by now so your microbes are very intelligent and  </p>
<p>they have developed new strategies of surviving 
so if you take a let&rsquo;s say someone comes in your  </p>
<p>house and they try to steal something and then you 
take a bat and you whack them right well the next  </p>
<p>time they come in their house they&rsquo;re they wear a 
helmet so these microbes basically have different  </p>
<p>ways of adapting to survive one of the interesting 
strategies some of these microbes pulled off is  </p>
<p>they basically can mimic and adapt to your vitamin 
D receptors they mimic the vitamin D receptor so  </p>
<p>when your vitamin D goes into the wrong receptor 
it doesn&rsquo;t work anymore so it&rsquo;s just as fascinated  </p>
<p>because you need vitamin D for the immune system 
so there&rsquo;s all these different types of strategies  </p>
<p>that use one type of micro adapted without a 
cell wall so they can move into the joints and  </p>
<p>then they can travel and they can do this and they 
can hide so your immune system can&rsquo;t detect them  </p>
<p>very intelligent sneaky little guys but thank 
goodness that our good bacteria also adapt so  </p>
<p>we have 90% of the nutrient nutrition absorption 
occurs at this level with other another thing  </p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting about this is that you 
have something called the enteric nervous  </p>
<p>system so you have the sympathetic which is a 
flight-or-fight that&rsquo;s like the stress nervous  </p>
<p>system and then we have the parasympathetic which 
is part of the rest and digest which controls a  </p>
<p>lot of this - that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s kind of like the 
opposite of the stress nervous system but then  </p>
<p>you have the enteric which controls like all this 
intestines and the peristalsis the pumping action  </p>
<p>of the whole thing and if years someone cut your 
spinal column for example you could this will  </p>
<p>still work because it&rsquo;s an independent nervous 
system it can work on its own that&rsquo;s what I call  </p>
<p>the second brain but the challenge is that a 
lot of the information that happens down here  </p>
<p>is transmitted up to the brain so whatever&rsquo;s going 
on your digestion can affect your mood you could  </p>
<p>it could have create depression anxiety and a 
lot of tension in your neck and even a lot of  </p>
<p>headaches so it&rsquo;s interesting how the digestion 
can affect your mood and also your mood could  </p>
<p>affect your digestion both ways because it&rsquo;s a 
second brain the bacteria also makes a lot of B  </p>
<p>vitamins so what happens when I see people with 
vitamin B deficiencies it&rsquo;s not because they&rsquo;re  </p>
<p>not consuming them is because they don&rsquo;t have 
the microbes or they they don&rsquo;t have the good  </p>
<p>digestive system to absorb those vitamin B 
over those B vitamins or they they make them  </p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t get absorbed because the surface 
lining of the intestines is damaged so I&rsquo;ll get  </p>
<p>to that in a little bit but what these microbes 
eat or consume is fiber preferably when we want  </p>
<p>to feed them a vegetable fiber and they turn it 
into something called butyrate which is a type of  </p>
<p>acid that then will feed the colon cells so it&rsquo;s 
it&rsquo;s interesting these microbes actually exchange  </p>
<p>with us we help them they we provide a house and 
they give us food as well so that&rsquo;s what happens  </p>
<p>in the small intestine and the large intestine is 
mainly responsible for reabsorption of water and  </p>
<p>minerals but this is where you have the highest 
concentration of microbes so without the microbes  </p>
<p>here you&rsquo;ll get diarrhea okay the little little 
roots that occur in a small intestine are called  </p>
<p>little villi they&rsquo;re upside down roots and that&rsquo;s 
where it absorbs and you have like a million  </p>
<p>bacteria per millimeter like a real small surface 
area there&rsquo;s a so many compacted microbes in there  </p>
<p>that are supposed to help you absorb and write 
when it gets absorbed it goes right into the  </p>
<p>lymphatic system 80% of your lymphatic system is 
surrounding your intestines so 85% of your immune  </p>
<p>system is really connected to your gut and it&rsquo;s 
there and it&rsquo;s kind of like immigration to give  </p>
<p>these microbes a stamp of approval or not approval 
to not let them through so there&rsquo;s a barrier there  </p>
<p>that resists microbes that are unfriendly so 
when you destroy these little so-called villi  </p>
<p>or little roots you get this small surface area 
where you now you can&rsquo;t you lose your immigration  </p>
<p>so now my unfriendly microbes can innervate and 
start to go into the lymphatic system and create  </p>
<p>health for the immune system that&rsquo;s where you get 
autoimmune diseases that&rsquo;s where the immune system  </p>
<p>you know starts giving the wrong information and 
attacking it&rsquo;s not creating antibodies for your  </p>
<p>own tissue it&rsquo;s like self attack so you have a 
lot of inflammatory conditions that originated  </p>
<p>from this lining that you lose the structure 
okay so there&rsquo;s a couple things that you can  </p>
<p>do number one you have to build up the flora and 
I think the best way is to take something called  </p>
<p>effective microbes I&rsquo;ll put a link down there 
I&rsquo;m not affiliated I don&rsquo;t get any Commission&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>or anything but I&rsquo;ll put a link down there of 
effective microbes and you can check it out but  </p>
<p>effective microbes is the symbiotic a group of 
microbes that basically all live on each other  </p>
<p>so they kind of work together and you want to 
take very very very small amounts starting out  </p>
<p>because if you have too many unfriendly strains 
you can create a war so you want to take them  </p>
<p>right before you go to bed and then they&rsquo;ll grow 
in your system over a period of time so effective  </p>
<p>microbes are very important and then to retrain 
your immune system your t-cells and start to put  </p>
<p>back that immune system I recommend something 
called colostrum and again I&rsquo;ll put a link down  </p>
<p>there below I&rsquo;m not affiliated with any companies 
but this is a really good thing too your immune  </p>
<p>system and it&rsquo;s really really good for rheumatoid 
arthritis it&rsquo;s good for inflammation it&rsquo;s good for  </p>
<p>autoimmune it&rsquo;s good for allergies it&rsquo;s really 
good for sinus mucus it&rsquo;s good for any type of  </p>
<p>inflammatory condition but I will say when you 
take this start off taking very small amounts  </p>
<p>maybe 1/4 of a teaspoon before bed why because if 
you don&rsquo;t have a good immune system you&rsquo;re going  </p>
<p>to stir up a hornet&rsquo;s nest and you&rsquo;re gonna get 
more mucus that it&rsquo;s gonna kick in there so you  </p>
<p>always want to start very small over a gradual 
period of time to start introducing these 2  </p>
<p>things so and I also recommend al glutamine - 
those three are really good to start building  </p>
<p>up the intestinal wall and then over time you&rsquo;ll 
start getting your immune system back ok so I  </p>
<p>hope that kind of gave you a summary of how this 
digestive system works and put your comments below</p>
