    <p>Is is Jake out here? I can&rsquo;t see him</p>
<p>Why do the two fat guys have to ruin everything I mean get your shit together you</p>
<p>The show started free burger</p>
<p>If</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d like to skip the bestie Twitter drama and get right into the episode jump to 20 minutes and 48 seconds</p>
<p>Hey everybody. Hey, we&rsquo;ve got a great show for you today. What a treat</p>
<p>This is gonna be here at the all-in podcast. We cover everything technology business market politic science</p>
<p>And of course the besties emotions and their feelings. I&rsquo;m Dave Friedberg the king of canoes</p>
<p>Joining me today are the guys that used to be besties first joining us from burly sconey&rsquo;s boomba boomba palace</p>
<p>The Pied Piper of spax himself to moth Pauly hop a boo you</p>
<p>Chamath welcome. You look great today. Thank you and from one of his many houses the</p>
<p>sass bully himself</p>
<p>David</p>
<p>sacks</p>
<p>And of course our former moderator and host the one and only the internet famous</p>
<p>the Bronx bully</p>
<p>Jason</p>
<p>Calacanis everybody J Cal. Welcome. You&rsquo;re looking great. You look like you&rsquo;re ready to do a little jab at a hook</p>
<p>So for those of you joining us today that haven&rsquo;t been following on Twitter, I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>Chamath did did you get Kermit the Frog to host the show?</p>
<p>I mean Jesus Christ that opening was the worst most painful thing. I&rsquo;ve ever heard. It really was not very good. Okay. Well, welcome</p>
<p>Not really feeling great</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a failed experiment already, I thought the opening was good. Good job free bird. I think you&rsquo;re doing well</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fucking four of ten. Stop prejudging his performance</p>
<p>Interrupting already stop interrupting stop interrupting Calacanis</p>
<p>So the moderator is moderating and J Cal has to take the money</p>
<p>dreamers and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna mute him. Thank you. So gentlemen, welcome as we know over the past week. There has been a Twitter feud between Jason and</p>
<p>David Sachs and I&rsquo;m gonna give you guys a little bit of this background for those of you who haven&rsquo;t followed online</p>
<p>Which I&rsquo;m assuming is the vast majority of you</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a Twitter account called all in stats and they publish an analysis showing</p>
<p>That J Cal has been talking a lot on our podcast and Sachs</p>
<p>You know kind of quote tweeted and said, you know</p>
<p>Here is statistical proof of Jason&rsquo;s piss-poor moderation of the all-in pod J Cal if you were moderating correctly</p>
<p>You would be fourth place in airstime interior time instead of tied for first</p>
<p>Your job is to facilitate discussion not dominate it. Stop interrupting and let the grown-ups talk</p>
<p>JCal immediately jumps up with a response</p>
<p>Maybe you could start your own pod with Peter Thiel and Keith or boys and have Tucker Carlson moderate</p>
<p>Sacks as I know it&rsquo;s rough doing 10 years of this week in startups and never getting to number one</p>
<p>Then Chamath Friedberg and I do it effectively on the first date on the first take</p>
<p>but this is why you need to stick to your lane and</p>
<p>Stop talking over us. Oh my god, so brutal sacks</p>
<p>JCal then responds with a niche podcast about just startups is never gonna be number one</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not for a general audience like all-in by design</p>
<p>number two sure trash the guy who is</p>
<p>Relentlessly supported you for decades because you&rsquo;re obsessed with your stats and forget about the quality of the conversation</p>
<p>Then J Cal blocks David Sachs on Twitter publicly Sachs tells everyone J Cal blocked him and this whole thing</p>
<p>Escalates and snowballs. So the besties have they broken up?</p>
<p>Are they gonna get back together? Is this podcast gonna continue? My mom sent me a text this morning</p>
<p>Has the pod disintegrated Jason pulled out question mark question mark question mark the drama?</p>
<p>Ensues so gentlemen, I leave it to you sacks with your opening remarks and then J Cal you may respond</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here to moderate this opening of today&rsquo;s all-in pod</p>
<p>So we can kind of get past this and hopefully get the besties back together and continue our</p>
<p>Conversations that I think many people find valuable and are super helpful and useful for us and for our listeners</p>
<p>Sacks, please. Well, I mean I can see on Jason&rsquo;s face that he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s hurt that by my my tweets</p>
<p>you know, I</p>
<p>Maybe he should go first and explain what&rsquo;s so hurtful</p>
<p>I mean look the reality is about this show that you know breaking balls is part of it</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been doing it for you know, a year and a half and nobody does it more than Jason and then all of a sudden</p>
<p>You know</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s on the receiving end of a couple of mean tweets and he&rsquo;s like the schoolyard bully</p>
<p>Who finally gets popped in the nose and goes running to the teacher and he can&rsquo;t stop balling</p>
<p>So, you know</p>
<p>where is it that somehow the word piss-poor crossed a red line for you after all of the</p>
<p>You know ball-busting you&rsquo;ve been doing for the last year that somehow that&rsquo;s out of bounds and now you&rsquo;re gonna block me</p>
<p>And potentially end the show in our friendship. So explain that to me</p>
<p>big, baby</p>
<p>All right</p>
<p>number one I</p>
<p>want to talk about the statistics in my role on my perception of you David is</p>
<p>that you got a taste of</p>
<p>Fame and celebrity and it&rsquo;s gone to your fucking head and</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re out of your ego is out of control</p>
<p>you now have stopped doing your job every day and you are obsessed with your statistics and how you&rsquo;re perceived on the pod as</p>
<p>Seen by your obsession and your bromance with Henry or Harvey</p>
<p>Bellcaster or whatever you&rsquo;re sitting there</p>
<p>obsessing over what percentage each of us talk none of the other besties are reading all in stats or</p>
<p>Getting obsessed with Henry Bellcaster and how they&rsquo;re perceived on the pod</p>
<p>You have taken a championship show</p>
<p>Which I pulled together with my decades of experience and team as the point God</p>
<p>I am the Chris Paul of</p>
<p>Moderating the reason this show is number one is</p>
<p>Because I created a super team</p>
<p>there are four people on this podcast who bring a lot to the table and</p>
<p>You have asked for decades for air cow</p>
<p>I will not pull out a list, but the time that you were gonna get canceled because of</p>
<p>And the other time that your company was in the because the beep was investigating it</p>
<p>You called air cow you called an air cow</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t deny it and</p>
<p>nobody</p>
<p>Has benefited more from my skills in media than you</p>
<p>Are you waiting? Are you speaking in an accent?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not speaking an accent. I&rsquo;m getting this is when I get upset what he&rsquo;s getting for Clemson. He&rsquo;s getting for class. He&rsquo;s controlling it</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m bringing the ball up court and I fucking pass the ball to everybody. I am white chocolate on this team</p>
<p>I am the professor. I am Chris Paul</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>And I pass the ball now if you want to be a point guard like me and throw crisp</p>
<p>Passes that make the audience laugh and make them cheer and bring down the whole goddamn stadium</p>
<p>Well, sometimes I&rsquo;m gonna do a no-look pass</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna hit you in the back of the head or it&rsquo;s gonna bounce off</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t fucking cry about it constantly David. And if you&rsquo;re looking at the minutes, I</p>
<p>Have to read the story and prep the story so I can put it in your lap</p>
<p>which I love to do I love my role here and</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking my minute count, which is at least two-thirds moderation and you&rsquo;re saying that&rsquo;s indicative me being piss poor</p>
<p>Now if it&rsquo;s all a goddamn joke, that&rsquo;s fine, but you&rsquo;re messing with my business</p>
<p>My business is podcasting and performing if you got a problem with me as the moderator</p>
<p>You have my fucking phone number. You can call me</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t go out and start some fight with me and then go start hanging out with Henry Bell caster when I&rsquo;m your boy</p>
<p>Okay, and then everything with you is about your</p>
<p>Call in clubhouse killer and we&rsquo;ve got to move the pod to that you&rsquo;re getting out of control David</p>
<p>You need to realize we started a podcast that went to number one instantly and be grateful about that and stay the course</p>
<p>The end I&rsquo;m done. Well, alright good. Alright, so can I respond? So first of all J Cal I agree</p>
<p>You put the the super team together for this pod. You&rsquo;re an indispensable part of it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not questioning that, you know, I don&rsquo;t think we should I don&rsquo;t think well, let me come to that the adults talk</p>
<p>Let me first</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m actually saying some positive things about you before I get into my</p>
<p>Critique, okay. So look you deserve credit for putting this thing together along with with Chamath</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be the same without you. You do bring an element of</p>
<p>entertainment to it</p>
<p>Lord knows if it was just free bird moderating all the time. It&rsquo;d probably be extremely boring. So</p>
<p>Look I although we&rsquo;re gonna give him a chance today. So who knows?</p>
<p>But rough start and it&rsquo;s not that I was angry or upset or concerned about my airtime or any of that stuff</p>
<p>I was frustrated. Okay, because your moderation I have a couple of</p>
<p>Concerns about her or I guess complaints</p>
<p>Okay, one is that you do tend to interrupt and I&rsquo;d say you interrupt not true more than the others fall</p>
<p>Okay, and specifically not true. Let&rsquo;s talk about the issue</p>
<p>The the issue where this came up was the Eric Adams issue last pod. Okay, so</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t even go to me this this issue. The Eric Adams issue is all about the current issue</p>
<p>What the audience doesn&rsquo;t know is that you went to Chamath like three times then you moved on and we had to come back</p>
<p>Said no, listen, I raised my hand to get back into the conversation. We edited that part out. You skipped over me completely</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how that was good</p>
<p>Passing where was the dish? Okay to me on that issue. Okay, let me explain to you. Can I respond to that? Sure</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got three people on the team who can score I come down the court I pass it sometimes there&rsquo;s two open guys</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the guy who was open who didn&rsquo;t get the pass and now you&rsquo;re walking down the court complaining</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s better keeping your head in the game. This would be like not going to Freeburg on a science issue</p>
<p>I understand</p>
<p>To defend the cops</p>
<p>Beating up criminals. I understand that your wheelhouse. No when it comes to that. I&rsquo;ll make sure it would be it would be a</p>
<p>Great with you. I agree with you. It&rsquo;s an oversight. I can&rsquo;t hit every perfect pass. You&rsquo;re expecting perfection</p>
<p>So then it&rsquo;s a miss pass and yet now you&rsquo;re upset about it. Okay, so then so then I basically say listen</p>
<p>I want to talk to this issue. I have three points to make</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not through point number two before you&rsquo;re interrupting me and taking the ball away the specific reason why I said</p>
<p>I have three points is to telegraph to you. Don&rsquo;t interrupt me bitch. I got three points to make. Okay, what do you do?</p>
<p>You cut me off in the middle of point two. How is that good moderation?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d do that to Chamath or even Freeburg</p>
<p>This really is about just really is about Chamath versus you and my relationship with each. I love you both</p>
<p>And the reason why I brought up the all-in stats, okay, it&rsquo;s not cuz I&rsquo;m concerned about my air time</p>
<p>but but to show a little concerned no because I</p>
<p>They broke down that I was like fourth in air time</p>
<p>And so the only point about that is why are you giving me the hook?</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not talking too much if I were talking too much if I were monologuing it&rsquo;d be a whole different story</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re yanking the mic away from me in the mid sentence before I even had a chance to finish and there&rsquo;s and there&rsquo;s one more</p>
<p>Thing okay, which is as soon as I bring up any concern with a moderation, where do you go?</p>
<p>You start calling me Tucker, you know, you start labeling me in this way</p>
<p>Okay, Tucker in the last just like just like a year dinner with Tucker and you&rsquo;re proving you&rsquo;re proving my point</p>
<p>Where do you go? It&rsquo;s called a joke</p>
<p>Yes, but why I&rsquo;m trying to show entertaining and keep it moving</p>
<p>No part of keeping the show entertaining moving is keeping you guys from monologuing</p>
<p>I have to cut you off and make jokes a year and a half ago at the beginning of the pod</p>
<p>We had to have the last time we had a sort of session like this</p>
<p>It was because you kept trying to paint me as the Trump supporter, which is not my agenda</p>
<p>Okay. Now you&rsquo;re trying for Trump. Now. You&rsquo;re trying to hang did you vote for Tucker label on me?</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t you saying? Hey, let&rsquo;s hear from George</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s hear from William Buckley</p>
<p>The reason why you&rsquo;re choosing those labels is because you know</p>
<p>They are anathema to most people in Silicon Valley and you&rsquo;re trying to stigmatize me with them</p>
<p>No, that is you&rsquo;re trying to are you reading from your notes?</p>
<p>Are you reading from you&rsquo;re trying to hang that albatross over my neck?</p>
<p>Okay, and that is you&rsquo;re trying to anathema ties me in in the in the view of most people Silicon Valley</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re causing what I&rsquo;m trying to do. You&rsquo;re trying to make a joke</p>
<p>But you are causing the audience to pre judge my message my points before I&rsquo;ve even had the chance to say what I&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>Do by by a time trying to make a joke even of the left to me</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>the result of that is the audience is gonna prejudge what I have to say and probably a third of the audience will never</p>
<p>Want to hear what I have to say because you&rsquo;ve pre labeled and prejudged me</p>
<p>That is a serious problem and that is fucking with my business</p>
<p>That is fucking with my business a lot more a lot more than me</p>
<p>Calling out your shitty moderation on one show. Oh, so now it is shitty moderation. Okay. I thought it was great</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure now we&rsquo;re back to it being shitty moderation. Let me ask you</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re doing, you know, what are you doing? Did you have to talk?</p>
<p>You know what you&rsquo;re doing. Have you had dinner with Tucker answer the question?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna mute both of you now. Okay, I&rsquo;m in the moderator Chamath</p>
<p>Do you want to weigh in on these two idiots and talk a little bit about how we can move the show forward and at this</p>
<p>Point I&rsquo;m thinking about V V vetoing the publication of the show so we can just have this conversation</p>
<p>This was this is so fucking pocket. This is just this is painful. This is this is so stupid Nick edit all this nonsense</p>
<p>Make it 30 seconds and move on</p>
<p>Hey guys, this is a really important powerful thing that we accidentally stumbled into</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make two points. David does get labeled and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair and</p>
<p>Jason does an excellent job of moderating and sometimes I think that Jason does get excited and in getting excited</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s also not just there to moderate. He&rsquo;s there to contribute as well</p>
<p>And so I think that if you look at the the number of minutes as a guide</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna be accurate because he does have two jobs to do whereas the rest of us only have one and</p>
<p>David does bring an enormous amount of clarity to what he says in a very fair way</p>
<p>And it is unfair to him that he gets basically slathered with here&rsquo;s the crazy guy on the right</p>
<p>So I think what I would just say is just let&rsquo;s just tone it the fuck down and calm down</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;re at a million fucking people a week. We could be a 10 million people a fucking week and we could fucking own</p>
<p>The distribution of our ideas to millions and millions of people</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just stay the course and calm the fuck down. Well, I agree with all that. Actually, I agree with 100% in agreement</p>
<p>I want to address the labeling issue. I want to address the legal issue. I am joking</p>
<p>Nine out of 10 times when I talk about trump because it&rsquo;s hilarious and your relationship with tucker</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s hilarious that you&rsquo;re part of the keith raboi</p>
<p>And and teal thing and and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s damaging for your business at all</p>
<p>And I think people are telling me i&rsquo;m purple viewed we&rsquo;re moving to the center here</p>
<p>So I believe that we&rsquo;re doing something noble by bringing all these voices together</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all a big joke and you know what? I don&rsquo;t care what you say about me on twitter</p>
<p>I know i&rsquo;m good at what I do. There&rsquo;s nothing you could say that can change that. Why did your accent change?</p>
<p>I I think in general you are good at what you do and I and I</p>
<p>And the reason I have two of the top 10 tech podcasts go open up your fucking podcast player</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t tell me to get my fucking shoes. I don&rsquo;t shine shoes anymore foreign number four and number eight</p>
<p>No, nobody&rsquo;s saying that so I think I think what what david is literally what he said</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s literally what he&rsquo;s doing right now is showing why I had to tweet which is you won&rsquo;t take a note</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell the guy. Hey, listen, you gotta know for me. It&rsquo;s not gonna happen on twitter</p>
<p>You got my fucking phone number. Well, it doesn&rsquo;t happen in private either. We know that you could fucking call me</p>
<p>Oh, really? You&rsquo;re gonna take a note in private</p>
<p>With your fucking week i&rsquo;ve tried we&rsquo;ve had this conversation before we had this specific conversation about the trump thing a year ago</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t talked about trump in six months. You&rsquo;re back to all your bad habits</p>
<p>Can we just hear an apology from one to the other and tell the other?</p>
<p>Absolutely willing to hear sax&rsquo;s apology. Tell him what you appreciate about him and what you like about him. Go ahead</p>
<p>Yeah, go fucking christ. Is this therapy? All right, I unblocked fucking sax and i&rsquo;m following him enough. Thank you</p>
<p>Move on we move forward apologize to each other</p>
<p>Sorry, you tweeted that shit sax. I&rsquo;m sorry. Come on susie</p>
<p>David apologized to him. Let&rsquo;s just move on jason. Tell sax you&rsquo;re sorry for labeling him and you know</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be more conscientious in the future, please. I&rsquo;m, sorry</p>
<p>That I brought up your relationship with tucker</p>
<p>And that I labeled you</p>
<p>a trump</p>
<p>disciple</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even need an apology. I just want him to recognize me too</p>
<p>So i&rsquo;m trying to be the bigger man. Fuck it. I take it back</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>I unblocked you and you&rsquo;re followed. I unblocked you and you&rsquo;re followed that&rsquo;s enough sax</p>
<p>his feelings were hurt by you telling him that his podcast sucks and</p>
<p>And yeah, piss poor piss poor</p>
<p>Okay, look you asked me to have 10 of your founders on the podcast in the last two years</p>
<p>I counted your team is in the fucking mix trying to get people</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not gonna keep it going you&rsquo;ve benefited from this relationship as well. So thank you for that. I never said I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Thank you, all i&rsquo;ve ever said is thank you to you. All right, we good</p>
<p>Look my frustration</p>
<p>Over your moderation boiled off into a couple of tweets last week. I did not mean to hurt your feelings</p>
<p>I was just trying to give you a note</p>
<p>Okay, if you would take the notes in private, I would give you them to you in private</p>
<p>I do think that overall you&rsquo;re a great moderator your contribution to the show is</p>
<p>Absolutely necessary and essential</p>
<p>Never disputed that I think we should keep doing the show</p>
<p>Um, I didn&rsquo;t expect you to block me. Honestly, I didn&rsquo;t expect your feelings to be so hurt by what I said</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Um, so yeah, look I apologize for that</p>
<p>All I wanted to do is give you a note and I would appreciate if you could try and respect my note</p>
<p>Not mischaracterize it. I think you know what i&rsquo;m saying, right?</p>
<p>I just want the chance to be able to present my views without the audience pre-judging them because you know</p>
<p>That certain labels will not go over well with our audience</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;d be like introducing chamath as the michael milken of spax. Okay</p>
<p>There is I edited that out</p>
<p>No, I mean i&rsquo;m not saying he is</p>
<p>No, i&rsquo;m saying it would be as if you did that right you understand what you&rsquo;d be doing</p>
<p>If you labeled him that way I don&rsquo;t think that is a fair label in fairness</p>
<p>I thought the labeling and the joking about you being the token republican</p>
<p>Was a meta joke about the fact that silicon valley doesn&rsquo;t have too many of you and teals and reboys, etc</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a small I think the whole point of what we were trying to say is silicon valley&rsquo;s heads up their ass</p>
<p>I agree</p>
<p>So maybe so maybe the problem maybe the problem we&rsquo;ve we&rsquo;ve identified is</p>
<p>All these left-leaning people are just sniffing their own balls basically running to a cliff</p>
<p>Shredding. So yeah, a lot of my views like on free speech are the old</p>
<p>Center left exactly and now you&rsquo;re for universal health care. Look at you. I haven&rsquo;t moved the whole world&rsquo;s gone crazy</p>
<p>I mean everyone supported free speech until five minutes ago. Okay, that&rsquo;s what I went on tucker to discuss you were free market about uh,</p>
<p>Education and you were free market about about health care. Now you&rsquo;re like, I mean we should have health care</p>
<p>I I am I am a believer in in markets. All right, jason. Let&rsquo;s start go. Let&rsquo;s fucking start the show three two</p>
<p>Hey, everybody. Hey, everybody. The all-in podcast is back besties unblocked with us again the rain man himself</p>
<p>david sax and david freeberg the queen of quinoa and</p>
<p>from his italian hideaway</p>
<p>gallivanting in</p>
<p>italy chamath polyhepatea the dictator big news for besties this week robin hood</p>
<p>um has filed their s1</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Paid a fin refined 70 million dollars for outages and misleading</p>
<p>Customers multiple days of outages back in march 2020. We talked about here</p>
<p>And poor communications around options trading risks</p>
<p>robin hood&rsquo;s s1 highlighted some extraordinary, uh growth during that period as we discussed on the pod</p>
<p>18 million funded accounts</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re on a two billion dollar run rate 522 million dollars in revenue in the first quarter up four x</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Monthly active users have more than doubled 8.6 million accounts to 17.7 million</p>
<p>Just in the last year revenue was up 300</p>
<p>Any thoughts on robin hood&rsquo;s s1?</p>
<p>Obviously i&rsquo;m an interested party. It&rsquo;s the largest fine ever. I think of this type but on the thinner&rsquo;s largest fine</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, so it should be a black eye for the company</p>
<p>but the reality is that they&rsquo;re happy to pay the fine and just</p>
<p>Move on so they don&rsquo;t have this issue hanging over their heads anymore</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re going to be able to ipo at like a 50 60 70 billion dollar valuation</p>
<p>And so for them, it&rsquo;s a sort of cost of doing business. I think there&rsquo;s something a little bit</p>
<p>off about that, but um</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of how it works freeberg anything. I mean congrats to you</p>
<p>J cal looks like you&rsquo;re gonna do really well with this deal, huh? It will return</p>
<p>Roughly this one deal will do three or four times</p>
<p>the value of the first fund the launch fund one which was</p>
<p>11 million dollars. Did you invest in the seed round or the a or what round did you invest in?</p>
<p>I think it was the seed round. Um</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s your multiple going to be on a 50 billion dollar market cap, you know?</p>
<p>uh, it would be</p>
<p>500 x</p>
<p>amazing</p>
<p>Amazing congrats big boy. Yeah, it&rsquo;s a congrats. J cal and i&rsquo;m happy to see that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Your success is finally catching up to your ego. And so I think</p>
<p>Well, actually between this and the composition, uh, i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>You know, listen, it&rsquo;s a long way to go before we distribute obviously</p>
<p>But that first fund I did which came after the scouts fund my sequoia scouts portfolio</p>
<p>My only advice to you jason is talk talk to a few seasoned gps like girly fred wilson and figure out the right</p>
<p>distribution strategy one of the biggest things that I see these folks do is</p>
<p>Early stage venture investors thinking that they&rsquo;re public market investors</p>
<p>Trying to time the market trying to figure out how to do distributions and it never works</p>
<p>Which means do you hold the shares for another year or two</p>
<p>I would distribute that immediately book the win move on. Yeah</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s interesting a lot of the top firms that i&rsquo;m in are holding their shares and I had a firm that had</p>
<p>Square and they held some number of them until it&rsquo;s seven x and then distributed. So I guess technically they get to book that win</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on that sax of when to distribute and how are you doing into your fund?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean it&rsquo;s a good question. Um, the reality is that you know</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that you&rsquo;re in year four or five of a 10-year fund. You could hold the shares for another five years</p>
<p>And if the shares go up over that five-year period you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll do better</p>
<p>So I think the question on irr your your numbers will look better</p>
<p>Well, I mean you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re compensated on the absolute amount of return that you generate and so it might be</p>
<p>If you distribute the shares and then if you&rsquo;re in carry and you just hold the shares you&rsquo;ll realize the same gains</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re not well, it depends what happens to the stock price</p>
<p>I guess I guess what I would say</p>
<p>But hold on a second if the stock were to go 10x and you get 20 of those shares if there were 100 shares</p>
<p>You had 20 if a 10x you&rsquo;re still getting 20 percent, right?</p>
<p>So it nets out to the same if you hold the shares yourself personally</p>
<p>This is why I think that if you&rsquo;re in the business of running a multi-fund business</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re better off generally and I think again if you talk to the best firms out there</p>
<p>They typically will not try to guess what&rsquo;s going to happen in the public markets. They distribute and they move on to their next fund</p>
<p>Um, and then because you have to remember the irrs, you know, you go through these rough patches</p>
<p>It decays quickly and all of a sudden something that looks great can start to look not so great</p>
<p>And the example of that might be snowflake or something</p>
<p>Going down after it went public and if you had distributed it, you would have booked the win at that high multiple</p>
<p>Yeah, and then then you&rsquo;re thinking to yourself. Wow. I hope it goes back up and then you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>Well, when do I distribute it&rsquo;s all if these are all not things that venture capitalists should be engaged in</p>
<p>They should be there to help build the next the next david versus goliath</p>
<p>I think the the cat argument to that is if you really believe in the company and think you understand it better than the public</p>
<p>Markets do or or because you&rsquo;ve been on the board and you have information, you know, if you hold it for another</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s going to be ups and downs, but let&rsquo;s say that you plan to hold it for another four or five years</p>
<p>um, yeah, you&rsquo;ll still get the same 20 25 percent carry, but</p>
<p>Um the point at which that carry will crystallize would be at like a much higher level and so</p>
<p>Essentially you&rsquo;re preventing your lps from selling is what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>And so you may get an extra turn of your fund by doing that. How do we feel as lps david freeberg?</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s sorry there&rsquo;s also isn&rsquo;t there like a</p>
<p>Um, i&rsquo;m just trying to pull up the goldman sachs report they did in 2019</p>
<p>Where they analyzed 4500 ipos over a 25-year period</p>
<p>And I think that and I could be wrong on this but if I remember some summary of this i&rsquo;m trying to find it</p>
<p>Sorry, I can&rsquo;t find it right now. Um, but that they</p>
<p>Basically highlighted that ipos as an index generally outperform the market over some period of time whether it&rsquo;s one year or three years</p>
<p>And so if you have access to those ipo shares assume you&rsquo;re a venture investor</p>
<p>You can beat the s&amp;p by 10 15 points</p>
<p>Just generally without having any thought about the business itself or the company itself</p>
<p>Um, and you know participate in 20% carry on the upside from there or 25% carrying the upside from there</p>
<p>And so generally the rule of thumb becomes well, you shouldn&rsquo;t distribute right away</p>
<p>You should hold is that not kind of a common dogma amongst gps nowadays?</p>
<p>Look at square look at square. I mean square</p>
<p>Like most of the appreciation happened in the public markets</p>
<p>I think sequoia held on to their square shares did way way better because nobody sold effectively for several years</p>
<p>And the best firms do this, right?</p>
<p>I mean like you we hear from girly and others that you know, they hold on to these shares for years</p>
<p>And you know a good business going public</p>
<p>Uh has a much better chance of performing. Well as a public company than you know, just tracking the s&amp;p</p>
<p>Uh after an ipo regardless of the valuation it exits at well</p>
<p>How do we feel as lps chamath your lps in a lot of terrible i&rsquo;m in 15 terrible you you want your shares?</p>
<p>I I don&rsquo;t know no offense to any gp out there</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re as good of a public market investor as I am. So give me the shares</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll manage it myself</p>
<p>Uh and get out of the way</p>
<p>Um, I I give money to a lot of to your point a lot of gps</p>
<p>Because I want private market exposure</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want them speculating in the public markets for me. I do that for myself</p>
<p>And so I would rather just get the shares and make my own decision</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>You know a lot of foundations for example are in the situation where they&rsquo;re there to fund programs</p>
<p>So if they have a you know multi-hundred million dollar position in a great company</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t fund a program or the</p>
<p>You know a hospital system can&rsquo;t do what they need to do because some gp is speculating in the public markets. I think it&rsquo;s insane</p>
<p>So give you give it give give the lps the money and move on it&rsquo;s not your job</p>
<p>Otherwise, you should run a generalized fund</p>
<p>And most people don&rsquo;t because they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Generally, how do you guys when you are a large owner in a company that goes public?</p>
<p>Or just say the pool of venture investors or owners in a company that goes public</p>
<p>And the lockup is expiring, you know, typically six months after the ipo and you can now distribute your shares to your lps</p>
<p>do those um</p>
<p>You know investors take note of or have concern</p>
<p>About the impact it might have on the stock price when they&rsquo;re making those distribution decisions. Typically</p>
<p>I think they think about that but a lot of these lps particularly the non-profits</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re forced day one sellers the minute that they get the stock</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just like as soon as the stock gets distributed everyone&rsquo;s selling and the stock takes a hit right and yeah</p>
<p>You know what? There&rsquo;s something happening</p>
<p>I mean, uh, this is speculation, um that I don&rsquo;t have so just you know, take it as that</p>
<p>but my understanding was some investment banks went to</p>
<p>The uh and chamath might know the background on this went to some of the major lps in the world</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave it at that</p>
<p>And said hey you have a position in I don&rsquo;t know this cab company</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s going public. It&rsquo;s fully valued or it&rsquo;s very well valued. Would you like to collar your shares?</p>
<p>uh before that and</p>
<p>We will take them off your hands, uh, and and lock you into a certain price for some percentage of it</p>
<p>Basically end running the gp&rsquo;s decision making process</p>
<p>Of course</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot about that happens</p>
<p>This is why i&rsquo;m saying I think the gp is better off if you&rsquo;re in the venture fund business</p>
<p>Be in the venture fund business do a great job at that</p>
<p>Raise funds distribute cash do what you&rsquo;re supposed to do, but please don&rsquo;t try to do some it&rsquo;s kind of like asking</p>
<p>You know the firemen to also operate on you</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want that take me to the hospital and let the doctor do the job</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a very valid perspective</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s probably the baseline that vcs should operate from but I do think there are</p>
<p>Exceptions where if the vc has been on a company board for a while</p>
<p>It feels like they have they understand the company better than the public markets</p>
<p>Especially during the first two years as a public company when the markets can be really choppy and the company&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Trying to find its level and people don&rsquo;t really understand it. I think there is an argument for</p>
<p>the vc having expertise in that initial public run then they might be doing their own piece of favor by</p>
<p>Holding but but look I I think chamath&rsquo;s point is well taken</p>
<p>also, uh</p>
<p>Companies are going public earlier</p>
<p>so this is going to become a bigger issue because</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an easy decision in year 11. If you were an uber investor an airbnb investor to say, okay</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been 11 years. We&rsquo;re going to give you your shares</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re in year five and the company goes out so early, you know, you could make an argument</p>
<p>Hey, maybe we hold it for two or three years just going back on the previous topic. J cal the um</p>
<p>The finra news on robin hood, right? So finra just</p>
<p>So everyone understands it&rsquo;s not a government regulator</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a private entity. Yeah, it&rsquo;s called a self-regulatory organization and these sros</p>
<p>Are basically they have a board and a you know, a bunch of people that run them</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re pooled and managed by all the participants the private participants in the market</p>
<p>So goldman sachs and morgan stanley jp morgan and all the banks. They are all part of the finra</p>
<p>Sro, and so the way that these sros are set up is to avoid government regulation and to avoid government</p>
<p>Intervention in markets and allows the markets to effectively self-regulate themselves</p>
<p>In a way that everyone in the market is kind of keeping an eye on each other and making sure that this is</p>
<p>Being taken care of and I think one thing to take note of from this fine</p>
<p>Is that it telegraphs that finra and the markets in general the market participants in general may be rather concerned</p>
<p>and rather worried</p>
<p>about government intervention</p>
<p>In some of these new markets and emerging fintech practices</p>
<p>Because they wanted to say look we put the gauntlet down on robin hood. We made them pay the biggest fine ever</p>
<p>We made them pay 70 million dollars</p>
<p>Stay away</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re taking care of it because the concern everyone&rsquo;s had is that aoc and elizabeth warren and a bunch of people on capitol hill</p>
<p>Are waving flags saying we need to step in we need to regulate these companies. We need to regulate these practices</p>
<p>We need to protect consumers</p>
<p>And so this fine really signals that the market is a bit concerned</p>
<p>That the government is going to come in and start trying to tell fintech companies how to practice and how to operate and generally tell</p>
<p>All market company, you know market participants how to operate which is a very scary prospect for them</p>
<p>So to me this was really this this was really big news about what it telegraphs the backdoor conversations are, you know</p>
<p>That are going on with market participants right now</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re almost saying is that this is a benefit to robin hood to pay the largest fine because it</p>
<p>It says to the you know to the politicians look we&rsquo;ve already been punished in this, you know</p>
<p>Maximal way you don&rsquo;t need to layer it on top</p>
<p>So in a way it&rsquo;s better for robin hood that they paid 70 million instead of 10 million</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not by the way. It&rsquo;s not even for robin hood. I think all the market participants jp morgan goldman sachs</p>
<p>They all have huge</p>
<p>You know tech teams and they all have acquired fintech companies and they are all trying to go digital</p>
<p>And everyone is worried about the government intervening and changing how this business is transforming</p>
<p>Because as soon as the government gets involved, it&rsquo;s going to slow down the transformation</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to you know, make things much more challenging</p>
<p>And I think that everyone&rsquo;s trying to keep the government at bay while the great digital transformation of markets is underway</p>
<p>um, and and I think that&rsquo;s like the biggest signal from this this finra fine</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some interesting nuances there that they brought up something like the confetti. So when you buy something</p>
<p>on</p>
<p>Robin hood it used to explode confetti gamification. They&rsquo;re like, oh we&rsquo;re going to take that out</p>
<p>And you know, if you go to vegas, they&rsquo;ve got bells and whistles going off everywhere when you place a bet</p>
<p>Uh, and so it is a little bit of window dressing. I think it&rsquo;s also interesting that you bring up the self-regulatory</p>
<p>Organizations, there&rsquo;s two other equivalents for people who are thinking about this the mpa motion picture association</p>
<p>which was formed back in 1922 because people had the same fear about movies and</p>
<p>Valentini, I think was the</p>
<p>the guy who really uh changed</p>
<p>How movies were perceived in the pg-13 era allowing a lot more violence terminator those kind of movies</p>
<p>And then you had a similar thing happen in the video game industry in 90s</p>
<p>Does robinhood still have like the lawsuits with like, uh, massachusetts</p>
<p>Uh, there&rsquo;s like 10 other lawsuits class actions, etc about um, no, no</p>
<p>More like with with government entities, right like like didn&rsquo;t massachusetts try to state attorney state attorney general</p>
<p>Yeah, something like that. I think right. Yeah</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. Um, but the other one that was very interesting was the um es rb</p>
<p>which is the entertainment software ratings board because video games like mortal combat and those and doom were</p>
<p>You know had to self-regulate, right?</p>
<p>Um, so either you regulate yourself jason tomatoes asking a question about lawsuits at robinhood. I know I was trying to deflect</p>
<p>notice</p>
<p>Can we move on to the delta variant because i&rsquo;m supposed to be</p>
<p>Hysterically afraid of getting covet now because i&rsquo;ve been vaccinated people keep talking about there&rsquo;s this delta variant</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s spreading and then i&rsquo;m hearing one set of information, which is if you&rsquo;re vaccinated, it&rsquo;s not an issue and then</p>
<p>other folks are going on tv saying</p>
<p>This is going to be like we&rsquo;re going to have to put masks back on in california</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t find any data about how many actual cases there are but according to the us cdc 46</p>
<p>Percent of the total u.s. Population has been vaccinated now</p>
<p>Uh and new york new jersey california all well about 50 some people are in the 60 of adults 70 of adults</p>
<p>Florida is still trailing, but I can&rsquo;t and people are saying this is going to become the dominant variant freeberg</p>
<p>How should we look at the delta variant if you&rsquo;re vaccinated and then how should we look at it in terms of?</p>
<p>Are we going to go through?</p>
<p>Mandatory masks again, which people are starting to signal already in certain</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>coastal cities</p>
<p>Yeah, so trevor bedford&rsquo;s a great guy to follow on this. Uh, he&rsquo;s a epidemiologist virologist who um on twitter</p>
<p>On twitter. Yeah, uh trvrb is his uh twitter handle</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s aggregated a bunch of good data</p>
<p>so there was a paper published two days ago out of the uk where they were trying to estimate the um,</p>
<p>uh, you know the reproduction rate, uh of</p>
<p>The delta variant and it looks like it&rsquo;s about 1.3. That means for every person that gets infected with the delta</p>
<p>Variant of the sars-cov-2 virus. That&rsquo;s the r0 you&rsquo;re talking about. That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s yeah, some people call r0. Yeah, and so um</p>
<p>It turns out that you know, that number is higher than what we saw with the original sars-cov-2</p>
<p>Which I think was probably closer to 1.1 or so</p>
<p>And so, um, you know what that means is this variant is much more infectious, right?</p>
<p>It could spread through the air that the proteins could last in oxygen much longer and not degrade</p>
<p>All these different reasons why it might be kind of more infectious</p>
<p>Um, and there are some cases of people that have been vaccinated, but this is not the predominance of what we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>That have tested positive for having this delta variant, but are having mild to moderate symptoms</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t at this point a lot of people</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a lot of data to indicate that this is actually kind of like a lethal risk or fatal risk to people that have</p>
<p>been vaccinated in case in fact that seems to be</p>
<p>Not true and one way that that data is kind of demonstrated right now</p>
<p>Is there was another analysis that was done where they showed what is the reproduction rate of this variant?</p>
<p>Based on what percentage of the population has been vaccinated by state</p>
<p>And they show that you know for a state that&rsquo;s had maybe 30 percent of its population vaccinated</p>
<p>The r0 is closer to 1.35</p>
<p>When 60 percent of the state is vaccinated the r0 is just at one and so there&rsquo;s this, you know, um, you know</p>
<p>negatively correlated kind of relationship between how many people have been vaccinated and how</p>
<p>Much this variant is transmitting and that makes intuitive sense, right? Like if people are vaccinated</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to get infected. The virus isn&rsquo;t going to hop from person to person to person</p>
<p>Now when you do the analysis of what percentage of the u.s. Population is unvaccinated</p>
<p>And how reproductive this virus is a lot of epidemiologists are saying</p>
<p>That the models indicate that we could see up to 10 percent of the u.s</p>
<p>Population now get hit with this variant and what we don&rsquo;t know is what percentage of people actually had, you know</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 in the first run around last year</p>
<p>But we are seeing this this variant pop up now</p>
<p>The fatality rate doesn&rsquo;t appear to be much higher than what we saw with SARS-CoV-2 the first time around</p>
<p>And and so there&rsquo;s no indication to say like hey, this is going to be much more lethal</p>
<p>So when you combine those factors, it seems like at this point, you know, the the death rates in the u.s are remaining flat</p>
<p>And stable while we are going to see and may expect to see a continuing up surge surge up in terms of number of cases</p>
<p>Are we going to require masks?</p>
<p>this goes back to kind of my previous point about</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve kind of normalized ourselves to masks and shutdowns and lockdowns and all the stuff that we did last year</p>
<p>Thinking that it had an effect a recent paper showed that lockdowns had no effect</p>
<p>on the reproduction rate in the united states because at the end of the day what if a government says lockdown or government says put</p>
<p>Masks on people still have a tendency to do whatever the hell they want to do</p>
<p>And at least in the united states that is the case</p>
<p>That is not the case likely in asian countries where we did see an effect of lockdowns and masks</p>
<p>but in the united states these uh, these restrictions</p>
<p>Obviously had adverse economic effects, but didn&rsquo;t seem to have a strong epidemiological effect</p>
<p>Based on a recent paper that I will share</p>
<p>In this thing. So so what are we going to do? I don&rsquo;t know. I feel like we&rsquo;ve normalized mass</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve normalized lockdown. We&rsquo;ve normalized these responses</p>
<p>But SARS-CoV-2 is going to be here forever and it is going to cycle through variants and that&rsquo;s the concern right now</p>
<p>Let me make a prediction</p>
<p>I think that what at the end of this thing</p>
<p>what I think I have come to the conclusion of</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>there was</p>
<p>a lot of unknowns</p>
<p>that got</p>
<p>perverted into hysteria and mania</p>
<p>by a handful of organizations to basically</p>
<p>uh sequester power</p>
<p>And what we realized is that these people were incompetent</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t know what they were doing</p>
<p>Because you ended up in the same place with all of these different distributions of actions</p>
<p>And so now I think when you have this other variant, I think there&rsquo;s a growing sensation by a lot of people not just americans</p>
<p>that the cdc the who</p>
<p>Whoever it is</p>
<p>Is probably at best guessing and at worst making it up</p>
<p>And the ultimate result is there this it&rsquo;s almost as if they like being drunk with power</p>
<p>And so I think the last part of what you said freeberg is what I really agree with which is that this is not going</p>
<p>to be tolerated anymore and the reason is because</p>
<p>They are also politicizing science and what they&rsquo;re doing is when they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making poor guesses in the name of science, which is just as bad</p>
<p>So, you know, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen with the delta variant maybe a lot maybe a little but as far as I can</p>
<p>Tell I think people are tired</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>uninformed</p>
<p>Impacts to their lives and they&rsquo;re not going to put up with it anymore</p>
<p>Saks chances california goes back to lockdowns or some sort of mask mandates</p>
<p>Uh, well, they are they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re imposing mask mandates indoors in places like la and you have the teachers unions</p>
<p>the the national education union is now</p>
<p>Putting down all these conditions of going back to school in the fall</p>
<p>So I think you could be in a situation where we do not have they will call it school reopening</p>
<p>But we will not have five day a week in-person learning and the schools the public schools that have it are going to have all</p>
<p>sorts of insane</p>
<p>Restrictions and conditions like making kids who really aren&rsquo;t at risk for covet even even the delta variant</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to force them to wear masks they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>enforce this ridiculous social distancing</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re talking about making the kids who aren&rsquo;t vaccinated sit at a separate table like the outcasts</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s insane what they&rsquo;re talking about doing</p>
<p>So why is that insane david not to interrupt you, but i&rsquo;m just curious for how much you unpack that</p>
<p>Because so so look, I I&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m pro vaccine, you know, I think adults should get vaccinated</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think my kids need to get vaccinated</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that is a wise policy to to force kids to get vaccinated. They&rsquo;re at very low risk for getting the virus</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very low risk for transmitting the virus if they get it and even if they get it</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re at almost no risk for it being harmful or you know to cause serious illness or death</p>
<p>And so to impose all these restrictions on kids, it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re living in a time warp, you know back to last summer</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t know as much about the virus</p>
<p>I mean to chamas point they&rsquo;re imposing all these restrictions which are just unscientific</p>
<p>And it really seems like the real point is to create excuses for the teachers not to have to go back to work</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>You know a school system is borked when the truancy is on the part of the teachers not the students</p>
<p>The students want to go back the teachers want to be truant. It&rsquo;s like they want to be on permanent vacation forever</p>
<p>It is a really broken system</p>
<p>By the way, let me just highlight, um, you know to support</p>
<p>Uh the concern that I think people</p>
<p>Like like people that sax is kind of speaking to might be having</p>
<p>A research letter was published in the journal</p>
<p>Um of the american medalist medical association two days ago</p>
<p>a lead researcher with a guy named harold walsh and this paper is going viral amongst kind of the</p>
<p>You know the the scientific and medical community right now</p>
<p>What these guys did is they measured the carbon dioxide content of children&rsquo;s lungs</p>
<p>um from wearing masks</p>
<p>And so they were trying to identify like is this a risk to children to actually be wearing masks health wise</p>
<p>And the results are pretty scary</p>
<p>It turns out that you know, um in in in air in in ambient air</p>
<p>0.07 by volume is carbon dioxide when a normal and then they measured kids, you know, randomized control double blind</p>
<p>You know, here&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re not double blind</p>
<p>But randomized control there&rsquo;s kids that have masks and kids that don&rsquo;t the kids that don&rsquo;t have masks</p>
<p>Their carbon dioxide when they exhale is about point two eight percent</p>
<p>When you have to wear a surgical mask your carbon dioxide increases to one point three percent</p>
<p>um, and uh</p>
<p>You know when they looked at this in a more detailed way, it turns out that it could be as high as 3.8</p>
<p>And so this starts to reach a medical level</p>
<p>That is concerning for doctors that having these kids wear masks for hours a day</p>
<p>could actually be having an adverse health effect because it is increasing the carbon dioxide content of their blood because</p>
<p>You know their lungs aren&rsquo;t strong enough to breathe all this carbon dioxide out it builds up in their body</p>
<p>And so there is a now a counterpoint that is being made by scientists and doctors</p>
<p>That may be the benefit of the safety we might get from kids wearing masks and spreading the virus</p>
<p>is um outweighed, uh by the uh,</p>
<p>The cost of their health as a result of wearing these masks and to ask kids to wear masks for eight hours a day</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s five hours a day for nine months a year</p>
<p>Um, we&rsquo;re just now waking up to the fact that there may actually be consequences to this and i&rsquo;m not making a strong case</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like child abuse. So we sent our five-year-old to a summer camp in la, okay</p>
<p>And the camp is outside and all the the adults are vaccinated. Okay, but they&rsquo;re making the kids wear masks</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s no fun, you know, and they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Play sports the way they need to and we just said the hell with this and we took them out</p>
<p>Now what I don&rsquo;t understand is why people aren&rsquo;t laying this at the feet of Gavin Newsom</p>
<p>This is 100 his order, you know, all he has to do is say listen, we don&rsquo;t need these rules anymore</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kids it&rsquo;s outside and all the adults are vaccinated. What is the point of this?</p>
<p>And you know, and I think we have this recall election now that&rsquo;s been scheduled for mid-september</p>
<p>You know right now it looks like newsom&rsquo;s going to cruise to to to winning</p>
<p>But if we had a candidate in california who could say listen, we need five day a week</p>
<p>In you know in person schooling in the fall</p>
<p>No exceptions all the teachers need to go back to work or they&rsquo;re going to need to be looking for new jobs</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to kowtow and give in to all these unnecessary unscientific restrictions</p>
<p>Okay, because newsom will not make that guarantee. I think they could they could basically steal this thing</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have anyone standing up saying that</p>
<p>And I think the closer we get to the start of school</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t have that kind of five-day-a-week instruction, I think parents are going to be up in arms about this</p>
<p>I think they will be and I think what we&rsquo;re going to prove is</p>
<p>None of these folks really know what they&rsquo;re talking about. And so they will make it up</p>
<p>And someone will have some shred of evidence about something</p>
<p>on either side of any topic</p>
<p>And all it&rsquo;ll do is obfuscate and confuse and the end of it will be</p>
<p>somebody imposing</p>
<p>Something on to you that will have a negative impact on your life</p>
<p>But for their benefit in the teachers for their benefit, like I don&rsquo;t want to go back</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s I mean listen, I want to say all teachers don&rsquo;t want to go back to school</p>
<p>I know a lot of teachers want to go back to school and teach kids and take the masks off because it&rsquo;s insufferable</p>
<p>No, you I think you can say you can say the union and separate it from teachers. Exactly</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s all teachers. It&rsquo;s some percentage of teachers, but I think we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Going to move david freeberg. Correct me if i&rsquo;m wrong here</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to move to a two-class system here</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re vaccinated you get one set of rules and if you&rsquo;re not vaccinated you get another and this is where david I think</p>
<p>Kids who are over the age of 11 or 12 who do get vaccinated?</p>
<p>They shouldn&rsquo;t have to wear a mask at school. But then well, sorry. Can I just say something?</p>
<p>This is what the insanity of this thing is. It&rsquo;s like, okay, we&rsquo;re gonna throw around again</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re probably going to use the word equity</p>
<p>When we make these new rules, but then fine, why don&rsquo;t you just create a school</p>
<p>That has everybody in it who is vaccinated</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t even understand. I don&rsquo;t understand this because all of us are vaccinated</p>
<p>So why we don&rsquo;t need to worry about it?</p>
<p>So in other words, we&rsquo;re going to impose restrictions on people and force kids or whoever to get vaccinated</p>
<p>To protect whom if all the adults are vaccinated, we&rsquo;re not protecting anybody</p>
<p>All we&rsquo;re doing is protecting I guess</p>
<p>Unvaccinated adults that makes no sense to me. Well, they&rsquo;re taking the risk, right?</p>
<p>I mean if you&rsquo;re choosing to not get the vaccine at this point friedberg</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking some significant level of risk or some moderate. Well, does the government have a responsibility to protect that person?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it matters. What I think matters is remember like the societal responsibility</p>
<p>Is not and cannot be to protect every individual</p>
<p>The societal responsibility is to make sure that society functions</p>
<p>And um, and if we take a zoom back and I just want everyone to reset your brains</p>
<p>Go back to march of last year</p>
<p>And we were talking about the surge of deaths in hospitals and hospitals were going to be overwhelmed</p>
<p>And that was the reason we needed to go into lockdowns and the reason we needed to stop the surge</p>
<p>Even if this delta variant is highly infectious</p>
<p>There are enough people people vaccinated in the united states at this point</p>
<p>That this delta variant is not going to crush our hospital system</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to cause massive amount of fatalities, which is the reason we went into lockdowns in the first place</p>
<p>All of the concerns that we had last year that rationalized a lot of the extreme behavior that we undertook</p>
<p>No longer exists and we are now talking about continuing those those behaviors</p>
<p>Under a different set of standards and the set of standards is now I can&rsquo;t put a teacher at risk</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t put an individual at risk and even if that individual got infected if the fatality rate is so low</p>
<p>I can still say well they could die</p>
<p>Therefore I can&rsquo;t have them exposed right and that has become the new standards</p>
<p>What I think saxon that that article kind of talked about is zeroism</p>
<p>You know you get to a point if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re fighting a war on a battlefield</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, well, I can&rsquo;t let any of my soldiers die. We can&rsquo;t move down the field</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to move down the field</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to win the war and i&rsquo;m not saying that this is a war the point is society has to progress</p>
<p>The economy has to progress people&rsquo;s lives have to progress people have to be educated</p>
<p>Life is about progress</p>
<p>And if we halt progress because of the concern that any individual might get harmed</p>
<p>Because of the progress of the group as a whole</p>
<p>We will not go anywhere and we&rsquo;ve created a new set of standards that I think creates that very reality and it is frightening</p>
<p>Let me let me let me put a finer point on this</p>
<p>Which is just this coat this delta variant is just more covid fear porn</p>
<p>Okay, this is the third variant of concern where they&rsquo;ve been, you know running around alarms saying that you know</p>
<p>We have to worry the truth is is it more transmissible?</p>
<p>Yes, it is going to I think sweep through areas of the country in the fall that aren&rsquo;t vaccinated. But the question is</p>
<p>How does it perform against the vaccines and so far the vaccines are holding up?</p>
<p>The the variants none of the variants have really punched through the vaccines in a meaningful way</p>
<p>I think the stats on pfizer were it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>Was it maybe reduced the effectiveness from 95 percent to 88 percent or something like that?</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t a material difference. If you are double vax with pfizer, you are protected against the delta variant</p>
<p>And so this is just more fear porn that they keep pumping. I&rsquo;m agree. I&rsquo;m in agreement with you and I think this reminds me of</p>
<p>When we were growing up in the 80s</p>
<p>They tried to scare us about sex and hiv</p>
<p>And were you not going to have sex if you were in your 20s in the 90s and into the 80s?</p>
<p>No, you learned about hiv. You learned to use condoms. You learned that you probably couldn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>Uh, you know what people did in the 60s and 70s, which had many many partners</p>
<p>You maybe had to have fewer partners maybe longer term partners</p>
<p>But you could you could take your own risk by putting on a condom you could make that decision for yourself here</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a group of people who don&rsquo;t want anybody to make any decisions for themselves</p>
<p>And in this case the vaccine is wearing a condom if you&rsquo;re wearing a condom like your chance of getting hiv go down</p>
<p>Dramatically, it&rsquo;s just a known fact and we&rsquo;re at 263 people</p>
<p>On average dying a day. How many of those friedberg do you think are with kovat versus?</p>
<p>from kovat</p>
<p>I have always I I hate doing this because then people think it&rsquo;s like an inhuman analysis</p>
<p>But the way that actuaries or economists would kind of take a look at this sort of decision tree</p>
<p>And this sort of data</p>
<p>Is the number of life years lost?</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>So imagine someone is going to die tomorrow if someone&rsquo;s going to die tomorrow and they catch kovat today</p>
<p>And they die a day early you have lost a life day and everyone. Yes, that is absolutely devastating and it is awful emotionally</p>
<p>But like when we&rsquo;re making big decisions, we have to think with the data</p>
<p>And so if someone catches kovat and they and they lose five years and they die five years earlier than they</p>
<p>Statistically would have died. That&rsquo;s five life years lost when a child dies. You are losing 68 life years, right?</p>
<p>That is an incredible loss of life is one is one way to kind of think about this statistically</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>You know part of I think what&rsquo;s been missing in the equation and it&rsquo;s easy to tell the narrative</p>
<p>By speaking about people that have dead that have died that tested positive for kovat when they died</p>
<p>Is it now speaks to the fact that this is a binary experience and there&rsquo;s a binary number of lives lost</p>
<p>But the statistical the data-driven exercise which may sound inhuman and may sound awful</p>
<p>But again, we have to make these decisions using data</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re going to make large decisions that are going to impact everyone in a meaningful way</p>
<p>Is to look at the number of life years lost and I think if you were to do that you would still find</p>
<p>That the vast majority of deaths associated with kovat are very elderly people</p>
<p>Who are already very close to dying and that&rsquo;s why we are seeing the fatality rates</p>
<p>So low right now in the united states, even though kovat is still spreading with the delta variant</p>
<p>It is because almost 90 percent of people over 70 have been vaccinated</p>
<p>And as a result the people that are most at risk of dying are well protected and we are not seeing a significant loss of life</p>
<p>Associated with this terrible virus</p>
<p>The terrible virus is still spreading but the life lost is still not there now</p>
<p>Someone might raise their hand and say well, we don&rsquo;t know the long-term implications long-term ramifications</p>
<p>Long-haul kovid. Yeah, I would raise my other hand and say show me</p>
<p>What the data is</p>
<p>that says that there are those long-term implications ramifications because I can say the what ifs about anything and then</p>
<p>Implement any policy decision I want by just saying what if and we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>We have to say we do know here&rsquo;s the data in order to make a tough decision</p>
<p>versus saying we need to be you know, protective and use the protective, you know, uh principle of</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Of precaution or the precautionary principle and be really careful in these circumstances</p>
<p>Uh, because at this point the impact and the damage associated with some of our practices to quote-unquote guard against kovid and</p>
<p>And you know protect people</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s turning out there are real consequences to those decisions</p>
<p>All right, freeberg final question on kovid. Uh, should you wear two condoms?</p>
<p>In other words, should you get materna and pfizer or j and j and pfizer?</p>
<p>There are studies coming out now to say one plus one equals three</p>
<p>There is some super effect of getting two. I am looking into this</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking i&rsquo;m going to get a second vaccine. I might get to get a moderna or a pfizer or j and j just</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t wait. Don&rsquo;t waste the vaccine shots. Let them go to other countries</p>
<p>You know not needed</p>
<p>Not needed even though the studies are starting to show it gives you increased</p>
<p>I mean, do you need your test? Do you need your tesla to go from 180 to 185 miles an hour? I mean like, you know</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point. I mean look everything we learn about the vaccines makes them look better and better</p>
<p>The protection lasts longer than we thought</p>
<p>the um</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re more effective against variants than people were afraid of</p>
<p>And now we learn that there is even more protection by sort of this mix and match idea</p>
<p>So the vaccines have worked there are still I think a couple of groups in america that are very vaccine hesitant</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Evangelicals and african americans are the two groups. I thought it was male republicans</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s more like evangelicals. And so in a place like mississippi where you have large numbers of both</p>
<p>The vaccine rate&rsquo;s only like 29 30. It&rsquo;s actually pretty low in a place like that. You could see the delta variant sweep through</p>
<p>In the fall and you could see a lot of cases. I you know, let me</p>
<p>Let me buck your uh labeling categorization of me jake. I wish I was ready to say it</p>
<p>By saying that I don&rsquo;t think the leaders on the right are doing anyone</p>
<p>Any favors any of their voters any favors by not coming out and saying look the vaccines work, you know</p>
<p>I think trump could do a lot of good by coming out and just saying listen, I got the vaccine</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, pretty sure he did right he did he did and so, you know, I think if you are</p>
<p>in one of those groups</p>
<p>You know, and certainly you&rsquo;re over like 40. You should be getting the vaccine. I mean they work</p>
<p>Not to harp on this, but what did trump say when you suggested he come out publicly about it?</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s listening to me</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s fine. Nobody&rsquo;s listening to me obviously</p>
<p>I mean it it is very weird</p>
<p>that trump</p>
<p>Spent massive amounts of money on the vaccine and now doesn&rsquo;t want to take credit for project lightspeed by telling everybody to get it</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s got a lot of other issues</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s got a lot of other issues on the plate to deal with including an indictment that just landed yesterday</p>
<p>so maybe you know, maybe he just doesn&rsquo;t know what to focus on because he he sees his uh,</p>
<p>His budding empire unraveling before him</p>
<p>Did you see the report that said that trump was extremely thrilled by the fact that his cfo was indicted</p>
<p>for two reasons one is it kind of</p>
<p>Indicates that they didn&rsquo;t have enough to go after him</p>
<p>And two is it&rsquo;s going to make joe biden look bad and his administration look bad</p>
<p>Uh, because it looks like they&rsquo;re being kind of prosecuted and persecuted now</p>
<p>But that he views this as a positive and he&rsquo;s thinking about it as a way to kind of stage a 2024 run</p>
<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t I didn&rsquo;t see that particular story, but I do think that</p>
<p>Okay, well what the charges show I think is that they got nothing on trump directly</p>
<p>Um that I mean this turned out to be a big nothing burger after years of investigation</p>
<p>Just like the whole russia thing. And so it&rsquo;s 15 felony 15 felony counts</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>Trump was not let me finish trump. Trump was not named. They didn&rsquo;t get close to trump</p>
<p>All they got was they&rsquo;re trying to charge. Uh, wesselheim is his cfo with basically receiving certain perks as compensation</p>
<p>Violations, it was crazy. Yeah, this is penny any stuff. It does look like persecution rather than prosecution</p>
<p>And what they&rsquo;re trying to do is they&rsquo;re going after this guy wesselheim to squeeze him to try and roll over on trump</p>
<p>Well, good luck with that. That&rsquo;s about as likely</p>
<p>To happen as uh, putin releasing the p tapes not going to happen. Sorry, j. Cal</p>
<p>Trump is getting away. The one thing I would say I think that I disagree with respectfully is um</p>
<p>This is a 15-year</p>
<p>Tax avoidance scheme that included more than tne included people</p>
<p>Getting their tuition paid for for free and free apartments. So the equipment would be and then hold on</p>
<p>They then knowingly did this and changed the books knowingly so they caught them going into their accounting and changing</p>
<p>To hide it and so the cover-up worse than the crime</p>
<p>This is an explicit way to not pay their taxes</p>
<p>This would be if all of us took our personal residences and our kids</p>
<p>And didn&rsquo;t pay taxes on it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s significant. Jason. So the total amount for example that this guy got in</p>
<p>uh tuition reimbursements over this 15-year period was about</p>
<p>375 000</p>
<p>The total amount of some other rent perks that he got was for about one point</p>
<p>Six or seven million dollars the total amount of value that I think his son got</p>
<p>You know was spending a thousand dollars a month in a trump owned apartment when you add it all up</p>
<p>For a guy that was accused of you know</p>
<p>Being in cahoots with russia this and that and everything</p>
<p>You pinch the cfo for a few million dollars of effectively again</p>
<p>T and e let&rsquo;s just say that he did it, you know, some of these checks came directly from trump</p>
<p>It I think I agree with david. It&rsquo;s a bit of a nothing burger and it really does look like it&rsquo;s politically motivated</p>
<p>and the reason is because</p>
<p>These kinds of chargers are typically not brought</p>
<p>These are things that typically result in a civil penalty or restatement and you just kind of move on</p>
<p>You know, nobody nobody&rsquo;s trying to send somebody to jail for you know, getting for miss miscategorizing</p>
<p>I have a theory because we don&rsquo;t have full information and they weren&rsquo;t investigating this stuff before trump became a politician. Why weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>This if this has been going on for 15 years, why didn&rsquo;t this investigation happen?</p>
<p>Five six seven years ago. I could tell you why his um</p>
<p>the daughter-in-law of weisselbergs</p>
<p>uh was uh</p>
<p>Received a lot of these perks and then she dropped a dime and gave all the documents to them</p>
<p>My theory on this is because we don&rsquo;t have complete information yet</p>
<p>I think that they have other I think they have this bigger tax, uh a case around</p>
<p>making the assets</p>
<p>look, um</p>
<p>Smaller when paying taxes and inflating the value of the assets when getting loans</p>
<p>and I think they want to get that and the way to get that is to flip weisselberg because</p>
<p>Trump does not use email and communications. I think that that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on here</p>
<p>Um, but yes, you&rsquo;re right. They&rsquo;re trying to they&rsquo;re trying to flip him look</p>
<p>The the kgb had a saying show us the man will tell you the crime, okay</p>
<p>They decided we&rsquo;re going to go after trump. This is entirely political</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t interested in him five six seven years ago. Once he got into politics. They became interested in him</p>
<p>He became the man and now they are trying to</p>
<p>Roll up and flip all these people and try to get them to turn on trump and give them something</p>
<p>These democratic pitbull prosecutors they are going to make trump look like the victim here</p>
<p>This will rebound I think in a negative way it is a really stupid thing that they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>I mean this this could have happened in so many different ways</p>
<p>The guy was finished and washed up</p>
<p>Right. He was in his little hovel in florida, you know, no twitter account, you know in the one no twitter account no access to his base</p>
<p>Um the one time he actually showed up in new york two or three weeks ago</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw the photos. He looks so disheveled so old so broken</p>
<p>Let the guy wither into obscurity, but instead you pin these charges you create an entire press cycle</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to rally so many people on the right and actually a lot of people in general who feel like wait</p>
<p>What are we doing as a country?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we just let it just be done with this guy?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t ever want to hear about him ever again. And instead we&rsquo;re kind of like bringing it all back front center</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s a bad look. What do you think about the insurrection commission? Do you think that that should um,</p>
<p>Should be disbanded as well to mob because you think that should that should be pursued</p>
<p>Yeah, because that&rsquo;s not necessarily about trump that it is about a whole totality of things that really will lead into the fact that we have</p>
<p>a lot of far-right organizations</p>
<p>That need to be understood</p>
<p>We have one far-left organization that needs to be understood all in the same light</p>
<p>Which is that these folks are destabilizing force to democracy</p>
<p>And so yeah, you got to get to the bottom of what the hell happened</p>
<p>Sex do you do you think the insurrection commission is going to be equally kind of politically motivating for</p>
<p>For trump&rsquo;s face and for folks like that</p>
<p>Well, I just think that</p>
<p>You have to decide as a country whether you&rsquo;re going to keep</p>
<p>Relitigating, you know what happened in the previous administration?</p>
<p>I mean if we&rsquo;re going to go back and keep this going, you know, are we going to go back and look at why did the</p>
<p>FBI</p>
<p>Use the steel dossier to go to a fisa court to spy on members of the trump campaign</p>
<p>Had there were 17</p>
<p>Misrepresentations in their uh in their petition to the fisa court. I mean there was clear misconduct there</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to go back and re-litigate that and go after people and punish them. Look, maybe we should okay</p>
<p>But I think that this is the thing about politics. Everyone just wants to move forward</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a new administration now whatever misconduct occurred, I think the punishment was paid at the ballot box</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just time to move on and I agree with that</p>
<p>And I look I know there&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of partisans</p>
<p>On both sides who just want to go re-litigate and punish their enemies forever</p>
<p>But you know, I think the american people just want to move forward</p>
<p>Yeah, what are you in the far what are you in the far left want to do?</p>
<p>Well, i&rsquo;m not on the far left</p>
<p>I mean, I I think that there is a I do think that there is a bunch of gamesmanship here</p>
<p>I think this is a a chessboard that on the left</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re saying if we we if we have a chance to take trump out of political life</p>
<p>We need to do that because the cost of him getting re-elected in 2024 is too great</p>
<p>and so what we&rsquo;re talking about here is, you know, what is the best path to doing that and</p>
<p>You know chamath&rsquo;s right like just letting him fade into obscurity</p>
<p>He may not want to run again because he&rsquo;s so old and it&rsquo;s so painful to be president. He&rsquo;s 75</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s going to be 78 or no 70. He&rsquo;ll be the same age as biden going</p>
<p>I mean, this this is ridiculous. Both of these two guys are one-term presidents. I think that is</p>
<p>Abundantly clear. I think the question is what is biden&rsquo;s transition plan?</p>
<p>You know, does he actually only stay two years and transitions it to kamala?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know but there&rsquo;s no way that he&rsquo;s running for a second term either. He does not look healthy</p>
<p>I think that much is</p>
<p>At least and i&rsquo;m and i&rsquo;m saying this as you know, a centrist democrat. He doesn&rsquo;t look completely</p>
<p>fit</p>
<p>Um, and it&rsquo;s only going to get worse and this is the most incredibly stressful job in the world</p>
<p>Neither of these two guys are our long-term solution. It&rsquo;s time to let it all go</p>
<p>Right. It&rsquo;s like we had</p>
<p>Four years of just chaos</p>
<p>We now get to have four years to catch our breath</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s time to find the</p>
<p>late 40s to mid 50s</p>
<p>centrist normal people again</p>
<p>And we have three years to do it</p>
<p>Who do you think that is on the republican side and chamath?</p>
<p>Who do you think it is on the democrat side?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s going to run for the next election cycle because just this morning, by the way</p>
<p>An article came out that um highlighted that several insiders in the white house are completely like up in arms about how</p>
<p>uh chaotic</p>
<p>Uh kamala harris&rsquo;s offices, which is basically a way of starting to shoot her down, right?</p>
<p>So if you think about the the motivation here someone in the white house is starting to shoot kamala harris down</p>
<p>Which means they&rsquo;re starting to weaken her a little bit</p>
<p>In terms of whether she could actually be a good replacement for the next term</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s truly the motivation but that&rsquo;s typically what these sorts of stories indicate</p>
<p>so if not her</p>
<p>If not her who on the democrat side and you know</p>
<p>If not trump who on the republican side in the next election cycle because those folks are going to start to pop their head up</p>
<p>right the</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think the I think the person who has enough credibility to take a shot</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not clear that she will but if she did she would be really serious and</p>
<p>She could actually get people to be relatively normal as nikki haley</p>
<p>On the right but ron de santis is going to be the rights candidate correct and she&rsquo;s kind of normal</p>
<p>De santis is definitely the early front runner. Um</p>
<p>There was a straw poll in which he was the first republican to actually run ahead of trump</p>
<p>In a straw poll for what four or five years?</p>
<p>and uh, so yeah, it looks like um now</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s running for re-election in florida in 2022</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s on his plate. Yeah, but I think it looks like he&rsquo;s going to sweep to victory</p>
<p>He made the right decisions on lockdowns. This is the central feather in his cap that</p>
<p>Before any other governor really he looked at the data saw that to freeberg&rsquo;s point lockdowns don&rsquo;t make a difference</p>
<p>He went back to normal the state benefited. You look at per capita covid deaths in florida</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s middle of the pack, um, which is actually a really good result given how many old people they have</p>
<p>so he did a phenomenal job, I think setting covid policy in</p>
<p>Florida and he did it in the face of a hostile media that was just tearing him limb from limb</p>
<p>And so he showed that he only can find the right policy</p>
<p>But that he&rsquo;s got the spine to stand up for it. And I think as a result of that. Yeah, he has</p>
<p>galvanized early the republican base</p>
<p>if he wins</p>
<p>Re-election in 2022 by a by a strong margin. I think he does become the putative front runner for 2024</p>
<p>Very similar in a way I think to the way that that george w bush</p>
<p>You know, he he basically won</p>
<p>Re-election in texas two years before he ran for president and on the heels of that victory</p>
<p>He was able to make the case. Look, I just got re-elected</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, very popular in a huge state of the country, you know, I should be the front runner</p>
<p>I think de santis is in a similar position. What do you think about nicky haley sex?</p>
<p>I think nicky haley is sort of popular with the establishment wing of the republican party, but she does not</p>
<p>bring together both</p>
<p>The the sort of the establishment wing with the populist wing and what de santis has been able to do</p>
<p>Is get the business republicans and the establishment republicans to get behind him as well as the populist trump base</p>
<p>loves him and that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the um, that&rsquo;s the combo you got to have I think to to win the republican nomination and so</p>
<p>Nicky haley, I think you know</p>
<p>Everybody who sort of reads elite media</p>
<p>Is going to over index on her but if you go to the the straw polls and the rallies</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not just not going to perform in those polls</p>
<p>There was a very interesting article in politico though over the past week about how de santis is being very careful</p>
<p>Not to do anything to upset trump and I think he understands you see the vp candidate</p>
<p>With trump you think</p>
<p>Well that that that pre-assumes a lot of things happening. I mean look we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen. I think that</p>
<p>You know the the number one way to resurrect trump is what jamal said is to keep poking that bear to fill him</p>
<p>with the the rage to</p>
<p>To sort of counter punch and come back. I think it would be better</p>
<p>however for a new generation of leaders to look we have we&rsquo;re being run by a gerontocracy right now, so I mean just</p>
<p>Biden is 78. Pelosi is 80. Schumer is 77. McConnell is 80 and trump is 75 and that&rsquo;s today</p>
<p>Okay in 2024. All those people are going to be in their 80s or just about who will even be alive. I mean</p>
<p>Feinstein will be 91 or 92. It&rsquo;s time to have a new generation in both parties</p>
<p>Why are we being run by this gerontocracy?</p>
<p>What a joke do we want to move on to the drought and impending uh death and or the facebook fdc dismissal?</p>
<p>Oh, that was incredible</p>
<p>And also at the fdc got two gut punches in a row</p>
<p>Uh, and then you know amazon writes this petition to recuse lena khan</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s why she was hired</p>
<p>Incredible she was hired because she&rsquo;s an expert on amazon</p>
<p>The the amazon the amazon letter was actually extremely well written and basically said I know that she&rsquo;s in charge</p>
<p>Of basically finding fairness and fairness seems to be that we will get legislated</p>
<p>But we believe that it&rsquo;s unfair to us. So please take her out of a mix. I just think it was fantastic</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s incredible. It&rsquo;s like isn&rsquo;t this the point of having her in the job?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;ve hired a new prosecutor who specializes in organized crime and the gambino crime family has petitioned to have them</p>
<p>Exactly recused</p>
<p>From doing any organized crime, right? Their argument is that she should be recused because she published um articles</p>
<p>Yeah, that amazon should be broken up and they&rsquo;re saying she&rsquo;s already pre-judged the situation there&rsquo;s no way this is gonna fly</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way she&rsquo;s gonna get recused</p>
<p>But I think what they&rsquo;re trying to do is put an argument on appeal</p>
<p>So that if lena khan does break them up somehow they can then go appeal to the supreme court or wherever</p>
<p>And and this is basically reserving an argument they can make later. So just to highlight the fdc</p>
<p>Um brought this case against facebook</p>
<p>Saying that they&rsquo;re a monopoly and their monopolistic practices are damaging the market the dc federal court threw out the case</p>
<p>And they basically said that the fdc failed to demonstrate in any way</p>
<p>That facebook has a monopoly over anything because they kept using the 60 market share term and they&rsquo;re like 60 percent what?</p>
<p>And the fdc was never able to give them data or facts to indicate what facebook has a 60 percent share of</p>
<p>There are other social media services. There are other advertising platforms. There are other content sites that are all</p>
<p>In aggregate much larger than facebook. And so the case was dismissed because there was no demonstration at all</p>
<p>Yeah, which is why lena khan is of the traditional definition of a monopoly</p>
<p>And then elizabeth warren comes out two days ago and says we need to rewrite the laws</p>
<p>Uh, the antitrust laws entirely redefine what it means to be a monopoly redefine what this this impacts</p>
<p>and so I think the big question is</p>
<p>how much of a priority is it going to be for this administration and for this congress before they&rsquo;re out of session and</p>
<p>And we end up with a split congress again to step up and rewrite antitrust laws at this point</p>
<p>Is this really a high priority quest?</p>
<p>Or is it going to get that&rsquo;s why lena khan is being brought in is to take another approach like we talked about on the last</p>
<p>episode which is</p>
<p>You know the harm is</p>
<p>competition</p>
<p>and not</p>
<p>Uh the monopolistic power but downstream competition as chamath eloquently explained on the last pod the irony of the elizabeth warren</p>
<p>Uh statements was that she released them on twitter. Not her facebook. Somebody dug that or like</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s talking about the monopolistic powers of facebook on twitter, right? Right. You have an alternative. That&rsquo;s the point</p>
<p>Um, can I I&rsquo;d say I mean how big of how big of a like legislative priority is this going to be for democrats?</p>
<p>Because this could be if they rewrite the laws</p>
<p>It could be impactful to amazon apple facebook, you know, everyone&rsquo;s huge. It&rsquo;s a huge priority</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s six bills that just got passed in the house</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to the senate and I do think moving fast</p>
<p>This is one of the areas where you could actually get some bipartisan agreement in the senate</p>
<p>You remember it&rsquo;s a 50 50 senate all it would take would be a few democrats</p>
<p>To defect and they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to pass anything, but you got 21 republicans who supported lena khan</p>
<p>So, you know that says to me that legislation is likely I think it&rsquo;s going to go through I think we are going to see</p>
<p>Some some big changes and in fairness to lena khan this fdc lawsuit that got thrown out was brought before she got there</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t have a chance to shape those arguments. They have 30 days to refile. It&rsquo;ll be really interesting</p>
<p>To see how she handles this hot potato now whether she brings the lawsuit</p>
<p>In a different way in the next 30 days or whether she lets it drop</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>I do think that of all the big tech companies the argument for breaking up facebook is the weakest because</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true. Like it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s harder to say definitively. They have a monopoly in social networking when you&rsquo;ve got twitter</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got uh snapchat. You&rsquo;ve got reddit. You&rsquo;ve got tiktok. You&rsquo;ve got linkedin</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got so many other companies in social media</p>
<p>But but that does not mean</p>
<p>That the argument against amazon google and apple isn&rsquo;t strong those companies are clearly monopolies or duopolies in their spaces</p>
<p>Nobody can effectively compete with them their network effects or monopoly scale effects</p>
<p>I think that facebook&rsquo;s monopolistic impact probably tends towards</p>
<p>some form of information distribution, but it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>Technical argument that has to be framed accurately on the one side or it&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;ve aggregated long-tail advertisers on the other</p>
<p>But to your point david on the idea of social networking, I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re a monopoly in the least</p>
<p>Well, also they&rsquo;re re-litigating the approved acquisitions of instagram and whatsapp. I kind of feel like</p>
<p>If you bought these things and you approved it, what is it nine years ago and seven years ago?</p>
<p>Yeah, they said they said if you guys had an issue that you know</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s attorney general that filed this the suit against the instagram acquisition and whatsapp</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like if you had an issue with it, you should have filed the suit years ago</p>
<p>You waited too long and clearly there&rsquo;s you know, uh, you know other motivations like just because google was successful buying youtube</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean you can go back in and unwind youtube because they did a great job building youtube</p>
<p>99.999% of youtube success is because of google not because of youtube</p>
<p>They took a small team and they rebuilt that whole thing and they scaled the heck out of it</p>
<p>Let me ask you a question to sax if these companies paid more taxes</p>
<p>And got out of the censorship business</p>
<p>Uh, do you think they could you know, maybe take a little wind out of the sales? Yes</p>
<p>Yeah, of course</p>
<p>Look, the only reason the only reason those 21 republicans have now gotten on board with regulating the power of these big tech companies</p>
<p>Is they see those big tech companies using their gatekeeper power to restrict free speech and it&rsquo;s all one-sided and as partisan</p>
<p>Against you know their side of the aisle because these companies are populated</p>
<p>Generally speaking by people on the other side of the aisle</p>
<p>And so, you know big tech if they had just reined in their own impulses to want to censor the other side</p>
<p>They would not be in the hot water. They&rsquo;re in right now</p>
<p>They brought this on themselves now because it seems like facebook is starting to backtrack on the trump ban</p>
<p>Well, they haven&rsquo;t twitter and I think I think they got a big problem now</p>
<p>No, look, I think they should have been doing this over the last couple years the cat&rsquo;s out of the bag</p>
<p>What they thought could never happen all of a sudden became arbitrary</p>
<p>And the thing that they did was they started to legislate</p>
<p>A private company started to legislate power</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just a third rail issue the minute you do that</p>
<p>You have every government in the world saying to you&rsquo;re saying to themselves. Wait a minute</p>
<p>I am only focused on this one thing, right? I don&rsquo;t take a huge salary</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been grinding at the low levels of politics for 40 50 years to get to this exact place</p>
<p>And now I have a bunch of hipsters in menlo park telling me what I can and can&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>To the people that I worked a lifetime to basically be able to govern over. I mean, I you know, yeah</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t it can&rsquo;t stand. Yeah, so I think a big mistake that zuckerberg made goes all the way back to 2016</p>
<p>Facebook basically bought into the disinformation argument. They apologized for it</p>
<p>What zuck that was the time for zuckerberg to fight? He should have said no listen</p>
<p>Was the fsb were these bad actors on facebook?</p>
<p>Yes, but when you look at the total number of impressions and page views, it was like a drop of water in the ocean</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not the ones who caused this election to go the way it did obama used facebook very effectively in 2008</p>
<p>And nobody had a problem with us then and that was the time to fight</p>
<p>That was the time to fight and to your point david</p>
<p>He actually should have been even more he said the reason trump got elected was not me</p>
<p>But it was obama, you know, he could have really gone on the attack and he would have done himself</p>
<p>Well, look hillary hillary just ran a bad campaign if hillary had just campaigned in wisconsin</p>
<p>It would have gone a different way in 2016</p>
<p>So what zuck should have she had an idiot team?</p>
<p>She had an idiot. She had a terrible team and they were bad at everything including facebook including everything</p>
<p>Social media so zuck should have said listen don&rsquo;t blame us for the fact. The campaign was bad at social media</p>
<p>They put victory into the jaws of defeat. Uh, let&rsquo;s uh end on this u.s. Sprinter case. I think it&rsquo;s super interesting u.s</p>
<p>Sprinter shock. It&rsquo;s unbelievable richardson test positive for marijuana and it&rsquo;s suspended a month putting her tokyo olympics in doubt</p>
<p>Uh, she is the gold medal favorite in the women&rsquo;s 100 meter</p>
<p>Uh, and she could miss the games after testing positive positive</p>
<p>She said she smoked pot when she found out, uh in oregon legally when she found out her mom had died</p>
<p>um, and</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on the united states. I don&rsquo;t being agency</p>
<p>Announced this result on friday</p>
<p>Her explanation is so fucking heartbreaking</p>
<p>I mean, what are we doing here?</p>
<p>Change this decision</p>
<p>Well, there was there was this is similar to the golfer who was about to win the pga</p>
<p>And got kicked out on the final day because he tested positive for covid without any symptoms and an outdoor. He&rsquo;s outside guys</p>
<p>I cannot imagine a worse drug for a sprinter than marijuana</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean for healing great, but it&rsquo;s I mean you&rsquo;re gonna like run the 100</p>
<p>For a cheeseburger. You&rsquo;re gonna take it up</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a it&rsquo;s not a performance enhancing drug. What this is is this legalism these bureaucratic legalistic technicalities gone wild</p>
<p>In this case or this runner in the case of the golfer</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like the bureaucrats enforcing the rules have completely lost sight of what the purpose these rules are</p>
<p>The spirit of the rule is super important</p>
<p>And there was a professional snowboarder</p>
<p>And his name was ross</p>
<p>Rabaglotti from canada and he wanted a medal and they took his medal away</p>
<p>Because he had thc in his system</p>
<p>And qualified him and then they went back and gave him his medal back, I believe</p>
<p>and so this is</p>
<p>Heartbreaking and ridiculous and I I&rsquo;m not gonna watch the I love watching the olympics. I watch a lot of the olympics</p>
<p>I really enjoy it. Um, I think it&rsquo;s awesome and i&rsquo;m just not gonna watch this this year</p>
<p>Fuck it. I I just i&rsquo;m so offended by this</p>
<p>Like you want these people to take like opioids for their pain?</p>
<p>Uh and suffering when you want to take some anti-depressant. I mean jesus christ jason</p>
<p>Look, I also say like in in our</p>
<p>friend group we have</p>
<p>A handful of nba players and I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t think you remember this conversation. Maybe you do. I think we were all together</p>
<p>when they talked about the</p>
<p>up until uh</p>
<p>Marijuana was more widely used in the nba. Yes, the pills that these players were given</p>
<p>Literally borderline opioids crazy ripped their stomach apart ripped everything apart, you know created dependencies</p>
<p>And all of a sudden you had a natural alternative and people are going to judge folks for taking I mean these guys</p>
<p>Are brutalizing their bodies for enter for effectively our entertainment</p>
<p>And then we don&rsquo;t give them a reasonable way to manage their pain. It&rsquo;s outrageous</p>
<p>And everybody else is smoking a doobie during halftime or taking a gummy on the way home to sleep</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s so hypocritical</p>
<p>And it feels like I mean this country just feels like it&rsquo;s being run by a bunch of bureaucratic technocratic</p>
<p>weenies</p>
<p>And whether it&rsquo;s monitors whether it&rsquo;s we should give them a wedgie and throw them in the locker</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we should do with this. I whoever</p>
<p>Put this person they get a wedgie and get thrown in a locker</p>
<p>I knew you I knew you were a schoolyard bully jk. I&rsquo;m not a schoolyard bully</p>
<p>But I do think the hall monitors, you know, those pi you were a hall monitor weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Did you volunteer to be a hall monitor</p>
<p>Be honest. No, no, no, you were in the chess club. I liked our chess game sax. Yeah</p>
<p>Okay, this is how I knew this is how I knew that jk out wasn&rsquo;t real. I knew I knew I had heard him</p>
<p>Okay, I knew he was genuinely hurt</p>
<p>But I knew he would get over it when I got I saw my push notifications or a quest from chess.com</p>
<p>He started a chess game with me</p>
<p>So i&rsquo;m like, oh, how did I play because i&rsquo;m a neophyte?</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t how easy he couldn&rsquo;t be away for how easy was it to beat me as a 1200 player to my 600</p>
<p>yeah, well the chess.com analysis said that uh, I was never I was never in any danger, but uh,</p>
<p>I thought you played pretty well. And uh, yeah, give me a tip. What&rsquo;s my tip?</p>
<p>Well, you you didn&rsquo;t castle fast enough. You let me you let me try to get that bishop out</p>
<p>Yeah, you let me trap your king in the center and then you know, it was a but that but you did good</p>
<p>You did good. All right</p>
<p>I knew I was okay with you when I got to chess.com. I think we need a vegas trip</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;re all just a little cooped out. Maybe we need to go to vegas do a quick 48-hour run this weekend</p>
<p>Should we do a little 48-hour vegas run?</p>
<p>All right, everybody this has been an amazing episode</p>
<p>So, uh, i&rsquo;m officially unblocking sax and um, I even followed him</p>
<p>Love you chamath. Love you sax. Love you free bird. Jake. I have something to say to you as well</p>
<p>Which is I appreciate you. I I I love I</p>

<p>And instead we open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it love us queen of</p>
<p>What what your winners ride</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big uge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension, but they just need to release it</p>
<p>All in</p>
