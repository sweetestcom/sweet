    <p>Hi friends, I don&rsquo;t know where this episode is gonna go, but I&rsquo;m gonna just stand here</p>
<p>and run my mouth and see what happens.</p>
<p>So the thing I want to talk about is people being a lot more intentional about what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing than you think.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve kind of touched on this in other episodes, but I&rsquo;ve never like really went into it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said people are trying more than you think, putting more effort into things, but</p>
<p>people are a lot more intentional behind the shit that they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And the reason I want to make a whole episode about it is because everyone makes it seem</p>
<p>like shit happens to them by accident.</p>
<p>So success, if someone&rsquo;s very successful, if someone&rsquo;s famous, if someone has a lot</p>
<p>of money, if someone has a really cool outfit, if someone has a really good body, they act</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s all just a fucking accident and like it just happened.</p>
<p>And they oh my god, they&rsquo;re like a deer in headlights, like just a ditz.</p>
<p>Oh my god, how did this happen?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why that&rsquo;s so common and why that&rsquo;s like the trend is to act like you fucking</p>
<p>have no clue how you got where you are and how you have what you have.</p>
<p>But people behaving like this and people hiding their true intentions behind what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing fucks a lot of people up in the head.</p>
<p>So like everybody pretends like they&rsquo;re not actually trying and they&rsquo;re not actually intentional</p>
<p>behind their actions like, oh, I just don&rsquo;t know how it happened.</p>
<p>And that sends the narrative that shit happens by accident.</p>
<p>Success does not happen by accident.</p>
<p>Making money does not happen by accident.</p>
<p>Having a really good body does not happen by fucking accident.</p>
<p>So I want to go into a lot of these things and kind of deconstruct some shit.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to hit like every area I can think of, really, like, no, there&rsquo;s not that</p>
<p>many.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like six or seven.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s seven areas I want to like deconstruct and shed some light on because I know what</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like to be working towards shit.</p>
<p>And okay, this is something that I&rsquo;ve noticed there&rsquo;s a void of in like social media spaces.</p>
<p>So it seems like there are people that are wanting to start working toward their goals</p>
<p>and like they have their little routine and they&rsquo;re like doing their shit.</p>
<p>And then you have people who are already successful.</p>
<p>So you have the people that are starting on their success journey or you have people</p>
<p>that are already fucking successful telling you how to get there.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t see anyone in the middle struggling and failing and busting their fucking ass</p>
<p>and keeps getting shit thrown in their face.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve noticed there&rsquo;s a void in the market basically for someone that&rsquo;s climbing the</p>
<p>ladder but is also sharing all the trials and tribulations and all the hard shit that</p>
<p>comes with it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve opened up so much about some of the things that I&rsquo;m facing and I&rsquo;m dealing</p>
<p>with on my road to trying to fucking make some goddamn money.</p>
<p>Like honestly, it&rsquo;s so frustrating and I feel so isolated and alone with it because I only</p>
<p>see people who are already successful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not where I&rsquo;m at.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re ahead of me.</p>
<p>And then I see people who are doing their basic little fucking daily routines with their</p>
<p>lemon water and making their bed thinking that&rsquo;s going to fucking do something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do a whole video about morning routines and having a routine in your day</p>
<p>and how it&rsquo;s actually fucking you and holding you back.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a separate episode.</p>
<p>But my point is there&rsquo;s people that are ahead of me or people that I feel are behind me.</p>
<p>I have no one to relate to right now.</p>
<p>Like where&rsquo;s the people struggling their fucking ass off?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the people that are like failing?</p>
<p>Where the fuck are y&rsquo;all?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sitting there fucking being quiet and not posting shit and that&rsquo;s making other people</p>
<p>like you and me feel alone because nobody wants to post that.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to fucking post how they&rsquo;re so goddamn frustrated or how they just lost a</p>
<p>certain amount of money or how shit&rsquo;s just not working out for them.</p>
<p>No one wants to post that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s important that we start posting it because I really need to relate to someone</p>
<p>right now.</p>
<p>I need to feel like someone fucking gets it.</p>
<p>Like I feel like I&rsquo;m struggling and like as Gary Vee said, eating shit.</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m&hellip;</p>
<p>I hate that motherfucker, okay?</p>
<p>He pisses me off.</p>
<p>But I feel like I&rsquo;m like sucking fucking wind and I&rsquo;m struggling and the only people I have</p>
<p>to turn to are people that are ahead of me that are already at the other end of success</p>
<p>or people that are just having the idea and starting and doing their little routine.</p>
<p>Like, you know, I have no one that&rsquo;s actually like made shit, started shit, done shit and</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s failing.</p>
<p>Like honestly, where the fuck are y&rsquo;all at?</p>
<p>Like connect with me, be friends with me, be friends with me so we can be there for</p>
<p>each other and fucking help each other through this shit because it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>I need someone to lean on, but not just someone that is there.</p>
<p>Like I want someone that I can relate to.</p>
<p>I want someone that&rsquo;s like going through it with me.</p>
<p>Human beings suffer less when we suffer together.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not going to seem so fucking bad if we fail together.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s do that.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m also not the type that gets like jealous.</p>
<p>So like if we&rsquo;re both working on something and your shit takes off and mine doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a fuck.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be just as excited for you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to be intimidated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to be mad.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to like push me to work harder.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m going to be like, okay, it can happen.</p>
<p>Look, it just happened.</p>
<p>It worked.</p>
<p>Like I can do it too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to feel encouraged, not intimidated.</p>
<p>So if somebody goddamn come be friends with me that&rsquo;s on their little entrepreneur journey</p>
<p>and is struggling because I feel very alone and I&rsquo;m upset.</p>
<p>But anyway, let&rsquo;s get into my fucking seven topics of where I&rsquo;m about to expose these</p>
<p>motherfuckers.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So success.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my first one.</p>
<p>People that are successful, it doesn&rsquo;t happen by accident.</p>
<p>I wish it goddamn fucking did.</p>
<p>I wish it just happened by chance and I wish it was just fucking easy.</p>
<p>Like success does not just happen to people.</p>
<p>Even if they&rsquo;re not busting their ass, they&rsquo;re doing a lot more than you think.</p>
<p>So an example is Kylie Jenner.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, she was born into it.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>But so much more went into her being famous than people even fucking realize.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, you have the fame of the name, but that bitch became one of the most famous</p>
<p>people in the world because she was marketed.</p>
<p>She put what she needed to put out on social media and yeah, all these big managers and</p>
<p>shit are telling her what to post, telling her what to do, but she&rsquo;s still having to</p>
<p>do the work and post the shit so that she can become famous.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s still having to do a lot of things.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so much more calculated action than everyone fucking realizes behind that.</p>
<p>Because if you look at her Instagram, she&rsquo;s just a pretty bitch that does nothing.</p>
<p>She has some skincare, she has some makeup, but like, she&rsquo;s just a pretty fucking girl.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s all she contributes through her fucking Instagram is some cool pictures to</p>
<p>look at.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m saying everything is so much more calculated than you realize.</p>
<p>Literally every fucking thing about people&rsquo;s social media is calculated and thought through</p>
<p>and take so much more effort than you think.</p>
<p>I guarantee you there&rsquo;s 10 fucking people that run Kylie&rsquo;s Instagram and she&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>the one that takes the fucking pictures or has the pictures taken of her.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s 10 different fucking people analyzing shit, thinking of shit, scheduling shit, telling</p>
<p>her when, where, what, how, and all that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just her running the fucking Instagram, I promise, but we don&rsquo;t see any of that.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see any of the planning and the preparation that goes into any famous person&rsquo;s Instagram</p>
<p>or anyone that has an Instagram with like a decent amount of followers.</p>
<p>Because as much as like my Instagram is a shit show and I just throw random shit up,</p>
<p>sometimes I think it through and I calculate it a little bit.</p>
<p>Like I had to take into consideration the way that my grid looks because I have brands</p>
<p>that are like looking at my shit and I have to make it like look pretty, you know?</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t get to know that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get to know that these people are planning all this shit and putting all this</p>
<p>effort into it.</p>
<p>All you see is that they post a little story or they post a little Instagram picture.</p>
<p>They just make it look so effortless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, I just took this and threw it up.</p>
<p>Look at me.</p>
<p>Look how cute I am.</p>
<p>Look.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s all it seems like it is.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s 20 times more the fucking intention, effort, and strategy behind it.</p>
<p>Look at fucking Rob Kardashian.</p>
<p>He ain&rsquo;t shit.</p>
<p>He has basically the same opportunity being related to the family and he&rsquo;s a fucking flop.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t do shit with it.</p>
<p>Like Kylie tried and like has done a lot more to have the fame that she has and the success</p>
<p>that she has.</p>
<p>Like I get it.</p>
<p>A lot of people want to say it was fucking handed to her.</p>
<p>Kris Jenner is a goddamn genius.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said this before and I will give credit where credit is due.</p>
<p>I fucking love her.</p>
<p>They both have the same opportunity.</p>
<p>And why did Kylie skyrocket?</p>
<p>Because she fucking did more.</p>
<p>I can guarantee it to you.</p>
<p>But she was a lot more intentional with trying to gain an audience than Rob is.</p>
<p>Rob is like, okay, whatever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little famous.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s his intention is probably to make money.</p>
<p>He did that.</p>
<p>And Kylie&rsquo;s intention is to be famous.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s gone after that and done that.</p>
<p>But the success of that is like, there&rsquo;s so much more that went into it.</p>
<p>Even with like goals and shit to meet a goal, people are doing so much more than you realize.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m overlapping because I&rsquo;m about to get to that shit because like all these things are</p>
<p>goals really.</p>
<p>I have gotten so off track with this shit and I&rsquo;m frustrated with myself, but I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about success.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I keep overlapping points, but success, it is not fucking easy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, I shouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s not easy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not simple by any fucking means.</p>
<p>It takes a lot more action than you think.</p>
<p>It takes a lot more intention than you think.</p>
<p>And I say then you think, because everybody&rsquo;s posting that it&rsquo;s easy fucking peasy.</p>
<p>Like, Oh my God, you just drink your lemon water in the morning and you make your bed</p>
<p>and you meditate and your journal is successful.</p>
<p>No bitch, that&rsquo;s not fucking success at all.</p>
<p>None of those things lead to success.</p>
<p>None of those actions directly lead you to success or having a business or owning shit</p>
<p>or making money.</p>
<p>Sorry, none of those actions that everybody keeps posting about are going to make you</p>
<p>a fuck thing.</p>
<p>This is just my reassurance to you.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to start something or you&rsquo;re trying to be successful and you&rsquo;re like running</p>
<p>into a lot of shit, nothing&rsquo;s gone wrong, babe.</p>
<p>Nothing&rsquo;s gone wrong.</p>
<p>I swear the more you become aware, Oh my God, look at me rhyming.</p>
<p>I swear the more you become aware you&rsquo;re going to see that all the things that you&rsquo;re facing</p>
<p>other people have faced too.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not like the odd one out.</p>
<p>Like everybody has to go through a lot of shit and like put a lot of intentional effort</p>
<p>behind things and like this whole manifestation shit bro with the whole like you just think</p>
<p>a thought and it&rsquo;s going to create your reality.</p>
<p>No bitch, intentional action is going to create your reality.</p>
<p>So if you want success, you got to work for it.</p>
<p>You got to do things.</p>
<p>You got to take action.</p>
<p>So just think anyone that you know that has a business has had to go through the process</p>
<p>of doing the paperwork for a sole proprietorship or LLC or whatever paperwork they did to establish</p>
<p>the business.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>People have done so much more than you realize for their fucking business and you&rsquo;re never</p>
<p>going to realize that until you try and start one.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be like, God damn, all these people were doing all this or like they hired</p>
<p>an attorney to do their paperwork, but like, damn, like I, they had to do all this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to realize as you start to create something, fuck like a lot more went into</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So my next point is going to be about fame.</p>
<p>That one was about success, but I got some shit to say about fame.</p>
<p>People that are posting on Tik TOK myself included, we&rsquo;re a lot more intentional about</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re posting than we lead on.</p>
<p>Like I schedule, not schedule because you can&rsquo;t schedule tech talks, but I plan out</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m going to post certain things, what I&rsquo;m going to do certain things.</p>
<p>I record videos and I never post them.</p>
<p>Like I have over 400 drafts because I&rsquo;m so calculated about what I want out there and</p>
<p>how I want to represent myself on my Tik TOK accounts, both of them.</p>
<p>So I record a lot of fucking videos.</p>
<p>I do a lot of shit, but I&rsquo;m very picky with what I post.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m a lot more intentional behind blowing up on Tik TOK than it might seem like.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>There are videos where I am just effortless and I&rsquo;m like, whatever, I don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>if this one blows up.</p>
<p>But some of them I&rsquo;m like, God damn, I hope that one does good, you know?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s always the ones that you don&rsquo;t expect to blow up that blow up.</p>
<p>Because my Cabo video of me taking shots in my hotel room, that was just a for fuck video.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a for fun video.</p>
<p>And it got like 10 million views.</p>
<p>And I was like, huh?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s my most popular video.</p>
<p>And it still shocks the shit out of me.</p>
<p>But my point is, I&rsquo;m a lot more intentional behind my Tik TOKs and everyone is so much</p>
<p>more intentional behind what they&rsquo;re posting than you fucking realize.</p>
<p>Everyone is worried about what time they&rsquo;re posting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re worried about their fucking caption.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re worried about the way their pictures look on Instagram, whatever it is.</p>
<p>People are so much more intentional behind it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a fucking accident.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an accident that people look the way that they do and post what they post.</p>
<p>It is all very much intentional.</p>
<p>People say the shit that they do and behave the way that they do online for a reason.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason that everybody behaves a certain way.</p>
<p>Now my shit is my personality.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s just how I fucking am.</p>
<p>Like you know, like the people that know me know me because my podcast reflects exactly</p>
<p>the same as my Tik TOKs and shit.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m the same fucking person, but a lot of people construct like who they are and</p>
<p>how they behave.</p>
<p>But they do that for a reason.</p>
<p>Like that fucking dumb bitch that is like a Trump, like she&rsquo;s the Trump bitch that goes</p>
<p>to the college campuses and her name is Caitlin or whatever the fuck.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;ll go to like campuses and like harass people and just like fuck with them and try</p>
<p>and start controversy.</p>
<p>Like she goes around with her little microphone, you know, I carry, right?</p>
<p>Like shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>You dumb cunt.</p>
<p>You dumb fucking cunt.</p>
<p>You Oh my God.</p>
<p>I just wish I could run across the bitch like that so I could put her in her fucking place.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I would eat her the fuck alive with my words because she&rsquo;s a girl so I wouldn&rsquo;t hit her.</p>
<p>But when she said, I can&rsquo;t, you know, I carry, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I do too bitch.</p>
<p>I want about it.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t need to run around and fucking say that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to run around and be like, I have a gun.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even talking about that.</p>
<p>Leo, get onto something else.</p>
<p>Get onto your point.</p>
<p>But my point behind that bitch is like, she knows what the fuck she&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>She knows she&rsquo;s starting controversy.</p>
<p>She knows what she&rsquo;s saying is causing people to want to watch her videos.</p>
<p>They like to watch the conflict.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so fucking funny.</p>
<p>But she behaves that way on purpose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much calculated.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s just, that&rsquo;s not just the dumb bitch.</p>
<p>Like she knows what she&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>But like with videos, if you just would take a second and ask yourself what went into this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to fucking get disgusted.</p>
<p>Like if you look at someone like Vinnie Hacker for the people that know Vinnie Hacker, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>about to eat this little boy alive.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So like any thirst trapper.</p>
<p>So like Vinnie Hacker is just a man who comes to mind.</p>
<p>But if you look at all of these people that make like thirst trap videos, if you just</p>
<p>imagine, okay, what went into this video, you&rsquo;re going to get the ick.</p>
<p>Because if you imagine these people like setting up their ring light, putting their fucking</p>
<p>phone on it, setting their phone up, making sure that they&rsquo;re in frame and then like making</p>
<p>sure that their abs look good and like moving their pants around.</p>
<p>Like when they, when you like imagine them trying to perfect their self for the fucking</p>
<p>camera or like the ones where they stick their arm out and record their self.</p>
<p>Like imagine Vinnie Hacker laying in his bed with his arms stuck out trying to be like</p>
<p>sexy to his phone.</p>
<p>Like bitch, as soon as you imagine it from the other end of the phone and you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>observing them making the video, you&rsquo;re going to get the fucking ick and you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be like, ew, like that&rsquo;s embarrassing.</p>
<p>Like even with my shit, sometimes I&rsquo;m like, you literally like can imagine me like walking</p>
<p>up, setting my phone down, making sure I look okay.</p>
<p>And then running my mouth about some stupid ass shit or like making a fucking cooking</p>
<p>video.</p>
<p>Like if you just picture what went into this becoming a thing, that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to start realizing like, oh my God, there&rsquo;s like 45 fucking things I didn&rsquo;t even think</p>
<p>about that like made this video a thing.</p>
<p>And the whole thing I want to like bring to light in this and my whole intention behind</p>
<p>making this podcast episode is for people that want these things.</p>
<p>Like when these people are posting and making it seem like it&rsquo;s so easy to achieve these</p>
<p>things and it just happens by accident.</p>
<p>When you go out and try to do it too, you think it&rsquo;s going to be easy or you think that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get really good results because you&rsquo;re doing what everybody else is doing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing 12 times more than what they&rsquo;re fucking showing you that they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So when you try to do it and it&rsquo;s really hard for you, you&rsquo;re going to think something has</p>
<p>gone wrong.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be like, what the fuck?</p>
<p>Or you&rsquo;re going to get really discouraged.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m here to make this episode to reassure you nothing&rsquo;s gone wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for fucking everyone.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re just making it seem like it&rsquo;s no big deal.</p>
<p>But all the effort that you&rsquo;re having to put in, yeah, bitch, they all are.</p>
<p>I promise.</p>
<p>Like don&rsquo;t get discouraged, please just keep going.</p>
<p>Keep working towards what you want to work on and just realize that everyone is more</p>
<p>intentional with a lot of fucking things than you even would consider.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to get into more like personal things in a second.</p>
<p>But next thing is money.</p>
<p>People are a lot more intentional about making money than you think.</p>
<p>Everyone has a bill of some sort or rent or whatever they have to do.</p>
<p>And even the people that don&rsquo;t, like I live at home with my dad right now and I&rsquo;m living</p>
<p>for free because I don&rsquo;t have to pay rent.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m staying here to bank up some fucking money while I decide where I want to move</p>
<p>to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m moving out in the next couple of months.</p>
<p>And the whole rationale behind that is like, I&rsquo;m not going to pay to live in Pensacola.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m going to pay to live somewhere, I&rsquo;m leaving.</p>
<p>So like I&rsquo;m when I move out, it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m moving away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not just moving out.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to like, figure my shit out with that.</p>
<p>But yeah, people are a lot more intentional about making money and having an income than</p>
<p>they let on.</p>
<p>Like money is such a like a taboo fucking topic.</p>
<p>And nobody talks about it.</p>
<p>And nobody like tells the truth about their intentions with it.</p>
<p>Like everybody wants to make fucking money.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s goal is to make money.</p>
<p>We need it to fucking survive.</p>
<p>Like, at the end of the day, I know I have the whole episode about money where I said</p>
<p>you did it.</p>
<p>Like we all want it because it makes things very, very easy as a tool.</p>
<p>So who doesn&rsquo;t want more tools in their fucking toolbox, everybody.</p>
<p>So I just want to like make that clear.</p>
<p>People are a lot more intentional about fucking money than we think.</p>
<p>And one thing I kind of want to bring up about that is like, when you see influencers online</p>
<p>with their fucking paid posts and shit, you do not realize how much work goes into that.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t see the hours of communication back and forth between the influencer and</p>
<p>the brand.</p>
<p>And then you don&rsquo;t see the contract they send over.</p>
<p>And then you don&rsquo;t see how long it took for them to create the content, whether it&rsquo;s take</p>
<p>a picture or make a video for the brand, then they have to send it to the brand for approval.</p>
<p>And if the brand says no, we want something different, you have to redo it.</p>
<p>And then you post it.</p>
<p>But all the viewer sees is you just took an effortless looking picture and threw it up</p>
<p>and made $20,000.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the fucking case, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so much more complex and so much more difficult than you think.</p>
<p>And the intentional behind money thing, the reason I&rsquo;m bringing that up is because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nothing wrong with wanting to go for more money.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with wanting to make more money.</p>
<p>Everybody fucking does.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s just a narrative that&rsquo;s pushed where it&rsquo;s like, no, you&rsquo;re not supposed to</p>
<p>want more money.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not supposed to nothing.</p>
<p>And if you do want more money, you&rsquo;re not allowed to talk about it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re only allowed to suffer and struggle in silence.</p>
<p>Like you have to fucking just deal with it and then you can make the money, but don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>brag about it.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s such a weird fucking like connotation around money and like the whole thing.</p>
<p>But everybody&rsquo;s more intentional with it than you think.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve said that like 25 fucking times now, Leo, shut up.</p>
<p>You see all these people spending all this fucking money online.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like they have to be intentional about making it.</p>
<p>And even people that are like born into really rich families and they have the money there,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fucking stressed about it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just like, ooh, carefree, like it seems like everybody has a concern around</p>
<p>money and stresses about money.</p>
<p>The people that fucking go and are spending all this shit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re stressed too.</p>
<p>All you see is them being happy.</p>
<p>Oh my God, just being carefree and spending all this money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no bitch, they&rsquo;re stressed the fuck out too.</p>
<p>And even if they&rsquo;re not like stressed like we get because we&rsquo;re normal people, um, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>at least like taking it into consideration and being like, Oh fuck for a second.</p>
<p>You know, like everybody has that kind of worry.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what fucking tax bracket you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>Everybody has money stress and everybody deals with that shit and people are more geared</p>
<p>toward making more money than you&rsquo;d think.</p>
<p>So like even these little trust fundy people, like they know they&rsquo;re okay right now, but</p>
<p>I guarantee you they&rsquo;re fucking stressed about their future.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, okay, I&rsquo;m going to enjoy myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to ignore it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go party and have fun, but I&rsquo;m just going to ignore this feeling that&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>up of like, Oh my God, what am I going to do?</p>
<p>What if my money runs out?</p>
<p>What did I piss my parent off and they cut me off like that&rsquo;s all going through their</p>
<p>fucking head.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Next one is a little bit more personal.</p>
<p>So what people prioritize, they are a lot more intentional about, I swear to God.</p>
<p>So when people prioritize relationships or trying to talk to certain people, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a lot more intentional than you think.</p>
<p>If someone likes you, they will prioritize talking to you.</p>
<p>And I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but if someone makes an excuse for why they</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be with you, understand that it&rsquo;s an excuse.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if they&rsquo;re like, I need to go work on my mental health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in the place right now for a relationship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m worried.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really stressed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m yada yada.</p>
<p>Everything that they say is a fucking excuse because I&rsquo;m more busy than I&rsquo;ve ever been</p>
<p>in my entire fucking life right now.</p>
<p>And my mind is pulled in like 45 different fucking directions.</p>
<p>But if Mr. Right came and plopped down in my lap, you best believe him and make it fucking</p>
<p>work because I&rsquo;d want him.</p>
<p>Like if I found Mr. Right, I would do what it took to keep him and have him in my life.</p>
<p>So if someone truly likes you and truly cares about you, they will be intentional about</p>
<p>prioritizing you.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let no one give you no fucking excuse on why they can&rsquo;t be with you, but they still</p>
<p>want to be friends or like, Oh, I can&rsquo;t date you, but I still want to be friends with benefits.</p>
<p>Fuck that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re telling you they don&rsquo;t care about you enough to date you.</p>
<p>But yes, this is reassurance that people know what the fuck they&rsquo;re doing and there are</p>
<p>a lot more intentional about what they choose to prioritize than you&rsquo;d think.</p>
<p>But like friendships too.</p>
<p>If your friend is going to hang out with other people, they&rsquo;re prioritizing that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re choosing that.</p>
<p>Like people choose who they want to hang out with.</p>
<p>People choose who they want to be close to.</p>
<p>People put the effort, the intentional effort into who they want to put it into based off</p>
<p>who they like and who they care about.</p>
<p>People are not as oblivious as you&rsquo;d think.</p>
<p>I swear.</p>
<p>I really promise they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Like if you voice something to someone and they just act oblivious to how they just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how you feel so neglected and they just don&rsquo;t understand how you feel like unwanted</p>
<p>as a friend and not prioritized, no, they fucking know.</p>
<p>They know exactly what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re prioritizing other shit.</p>
<p>They just don&rsquo;t want to say it to you.</p>
<p>Like just if when someone does that, just let them do that and go fucking do something</p>
<p>else.</p>
<p>Like don&rsquo;t let someone just like play around with you like that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re clearly not okay with communicating their true feelings and intentions.</p>
<p>Uh, well one, you got to ask, but two, if you ask and then they give you some bullshit</p>
<p>excuse, they don&rsquo;t want to fucking hang out with you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>And the same goes for dating someone.</p>
<p>Like if they give you a bullshit fucking excuse or any excuse, like I said, it&rsquo;s an excuse,</p>
<p>babe.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but people are intentional about spending</p>
<p>their energy and time on things they want.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t do that, it&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>The next thing on my list, like I&rsquo;m annoyed just fucking looking at it.</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s appearance.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m about to like unravel some thoughts on this shit cause we&rsquo;re going to get to tattoos</p>
<p>in a minute.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>It fucking makes my ass itch.</p>
<p>People and their fucking tattoos nowadays.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re talking about looks and appearance first.</p>
<p>So people are a lot more intentional behind the way that they fucking look.</p>
<p>People are a lot more intentional about the vibe that they put on and the clothes that</p>
<p>they wear and the certain like style they have.</p>
<p>People are a lot more fucking intentional behind it.</p>
<p>Then you realize they&rsquo;re fucking outfits, their style.</p>
<p>Like everybody&rsquo;s going for a certain look.</p>
<p>All these boys on fucking Instagram and tick tock that are trying to look like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>being effortless.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re putting, they&rsquo;re laying that shit out the day before.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re spending an hour every night thinking of what they&rsquo;re going to wear the</p>
<p>next day.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re laying their outfit out to go to the fucking coffee shop in the morning.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re fucking going to school.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re picking their outfits.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re laying their little fit out like their first day of school outfit.</p>
<p>They be putting that level of energy into every day&rsquo;s outfit to look effortless, air</p>
<p>quote effortless bitch and ain&rsquo;t fucking effortless.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying so much harder than you realize.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not just going to thrift stores and finding all this great shit.</p>
<p>I promise you, I fucking promise you these little thrifters online.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not fucking finding all this cool ass shit at thrift shops.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of places that make vintage looking things and they just sell them at</p>
<p>on on online shops.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re very much mass produced.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very much not vintage.</p>
<p>There might be a couple of things people find that are ventures that are cool, like from</p>
<p>thrift shops or wherever, but not as much like no one is wearing a full fucking thrifted</p>
<p>outfit and look in the way that these people look.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d look raggedy as fuck or shit just ain&rsquo;t going to fit you right.</p>
<p>So like a lot of people get their shit tailored and that&rsquo;s something that people need to take</p>
<p>into consideration.</p>
<p>These people are not going to these thrift stores and just finding things that fit their</p>
<p>body perfectly.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fucking getting shit altered so that it does fit them perfectly, but they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>show you that.</p>
<p>They just show, Oh my God, I went to Goodwill and I found 500 fucking things and they all</p>
<p>fit me perfect.</p>
<p>Look, I have a whole outfit look for $12 but you&rsquo;re not going to say you spent 150 on getting</p>
<p>it tailored.</p>
<p>Dumbass.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s the shit that irks me.</p>
<p>People just are so fake about what they&rsquo;re fucking doing and they hide so many details</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, yo, so like when I go to the thrift store and I don&rsquo;t find a fuck thing</p>
<p>that fits me.</p>
<p>So I go to 12 more stores and I don&rsquo;t find a single fucking thing that fits me good or</p>
<p>looks cute.</p>
<p>Like where are y&rsquo;all finding y&rsquo;all shit, you know?</p>
<p>That makes me think something&rsquo;s wrong with me.</p>
<p>Ain&rsquo;t shit wrong with me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something wrong with y&rsquo;all lying about what the fuck you&rsquo;re really doing.</p>
<p>I also am six foot seven, so I will take that into consideration.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not going to find much that fits me very Alfie, so I will throw, I&rsquo;ll put that</p>
<p>one to, I&rsquo;ll put that one to rest.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s get into tattoos.</p>
<p>So when people get tattoos, they know what they&rsquo;re getting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re choosing what they&rsquo;re getting.</p>
<p>They know how it&rsquo;s about to fucking look.</p>
<p>They know the vibe they&rsquo;re about to have.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that irks the living shit out of me about tattoos nowadays is every</p>
<p>fucking little Joe Schmo fruit loop has them and they try to get them to look all tough</p>
<p>stuff like there&rsquo;s these little 18 year old boys on tick tock, be bopping around doing</p>
<p>their little dances with dope ass tattoos on like some tough stuff as shit.</p>
<p>And like, you can&rsquo;t tell who&rsquo;s with it anymore.</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t tell who actually will fuck your shit up or won&rsquo;t anymore.</p>
<p>Like every normal ass person has tattoos now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the people that used to have tattoos and used to fit a certain image.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, okay, we need to watch out for them or like, Oh, let&rsquo;s be friends with them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re with the shit, you know?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how like you could like tell.</p>
<p>But nowadays everybody has tattoos.</p>
<p>These fucking no good, can&rsquo;t even fight soft as a marshmallow motherfuckers are covered</p>
<p>in tattoos.</p>
<p>Vinny Hacker, what are you fucking doing kid?</p>
<p>Like he has some cool ass tattoos, but like girl, you trying to look all grunge and tough</p>
<p>stuff and you over here living in a goddamn fucking mansion and you over here making thirst</p>
<p>shots for a living.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very contradictory.</p>
<p>Like people want to look a vibe, but they don&rsquo;t want to be the vibe.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I just fucking figured it out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many losers with these goddamn tattoos trying to look a certain vibe, but</p>
<p>they are not that vibe.</p>
<p>Like these are the type of people to like try to look tough stuff and then get their</p>
<p>fucking shit smashed in because they&rsquo;re a fucking pussy y&rsquo;all.</p>
<p>You could tell I&rsquo;m aggravated by this because there&rsquo;s so many people that have like a false</p>
<p>sense of confidence and a false sense of superiority because they have some fucking tattoos.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a fucking loser and you have tattoos, all you are now is a loser with tattoos.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still a fucking bozo.</p>
<p>Your skin might look a little cooler, but you&rsquo;re still a fucking pussy at heart.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s another really big contributor to everybody being so fucking confused is</p>
<p>because nobody is what they portray.</p>
<p>Like everybody&rsquo;s intentionally getting these tattoos to look a certain vibe, but they know</p>
<p>that ain&rsquo;t them.</p>
<p>They know that their personality does not match that shit.</p>
<p>Like I saw this one boy on Tik Tok, I think he was like 17 and he had like knuckle tattoos</p>
<p>like how biker gangs get them and he had hand tattoos like skulls and shit with flames.</p>
<p>Like he had some really, really well done tattoos and I fucking loved them.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s this little fucking teeny bopper that like you ain&rsquo;t been through a fuck thing.</p>
<p>Why are you dressed like that?</p>
<p>Like why are you dressing your skin like that to put on this image that you&rsquo;re tough stuff</p>
<p>when like you grew up in suburbia and your parents love you and babied you and you have</p>
<p>a fucking horse.</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get to have those tattoos.</p>
<p>Okay, y&rsquo;all know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like do you get what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Like you fucking people, you are not allowed to have these type tattoos.</p>
<p>Like you look so fucking stupid.</p>
<p>Like these people are covered in tattoos and they&rsquo;re too scared to go ask for fucking ketchup</p>
<p>at a restaurant.</p>
<p>Like oh, I&rsquo;m in my villain era.</p>
<p>No you&rsquo;re a pussy.</p>
<p>Sit down.</p>
<p>Your fucking sleeve is cool, but you&rsquo;re a fucking little care bear.</p>
<p>All right, I need to stop being so mean and dissing everybody.</p>
<p>I need to cool it.</p>
<p>I need to drink a little water.</p>
<p>Oh, fucking chill out.</p>
<p>But yeah, people are a lot more intentional behind the vibe they&rsquo;re trying to put on.</p>
<p>I wish people would put more intention behind trying to be what they&rsquo;re trying to look like.</p>
<p>Like actually embody it and actually become it than just fucking look like it.</p>
<p>But unfortunately that&rsquo;s not the case because looking a certain way online gets you certain</p>
<p>attention.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t actually have to be that thing.</p>
<p>You can just look like it.</p>
<p>And everyone will still love you and think you&rsquo;re great.</p>
<p>So a lot of people can control the way that they&rsquo;re perceived online and they can shine</p>
<p>a better light on their self or like a tougher light on their self than is actually there.</p>
<p>Like these bitches that look witchy and they dress like very like hippie and they try and</p>
<p>look like witches.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to do that.</p>
<p>Like I love those girls, but like they don&rsquo;t just wake up with a wardrobe of fucking pentagram</p>
<p>necklaces and goddamn scarves and robes and shit that they wear.</p>
<p>Like no, like they&rsquo;re intentionally trying to do that.</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s style does not just happen.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re trying to look a certain way.</p>
<p>Okay, onto my next point because that just fucking derailed.</p>
<p>Like I really like that y&rsquo;all like to hear me ramble because that&rsquo;s one thing about me</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m a motherfucking ramble.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get off on a tangent and I&rsquo;m gonna get off my point.</p>
<p>I always come back to it in a way.</p>
<p>Next thing I want to talk about is people&rsquo;s bodies.</p>
<p>Like it goes with the appearance thing, but people&rsquo;s bodies, like if someone is in really</p>
<p>good fucking shape, babe, it&rsquo;s not by accident.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not by fucking accident.</p>
<p>I promise you, I promise it&rsquo;s not by accident.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying their ass off to look the way that they look like me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even look that fucking great and you have no idea how much effort I put into looking</p>
<p>the way that I do.</p>
<p>So these people that look 10 times better than me, girl, I can&rsquo;t even fucking imagine.</p>
<p>I cannot imagine how much more strict and like intentional they are with every fucking</p>
<p>move they make.</p>
<p>Like they probably jerk off at a certain speed so they can burn a certain amount of calories.</p>
<p>Like God damn, a lot of them don&rsquo;t go out and a lot of them don&rsquo;t drink and party and</p>
<p>do shit like that.</p>
<p>Like people, oh my God, the hot ones are so nuts.</p>
<p>Like the ones that have really, really good bodies are like muscular or like people that</p>
<p>are just in really, really good shape and they&rsquo;re very fit.</p>
<p>Like y&rsquo;all, they&rsquo;re like the fucking, they&rsquo;re a weird breed.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I really want to be like that, but I&rsquo;m fucking busy.</p>
<p>I have too much shit to do to be like worried about every fucking micro detail of like how</p>
<p>I look like y&rsquo;all.</p>
<p>I ain&rsquo;t talking shit because if I was bored and had nothing to do, girl, sure shit, sure</p>
<p>shit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be the most perfect looking motherfucker you&rsquo;ve ever seen in your life.</p>
<p>One day I&rsquo;m going to get there.</p>
<p>One day I&rsquo;m going to be so like tired of working on shit because I want to write a book now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like an X on my journey, but I&rsquo;m going to be so tired of working on shit that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to just make myself my own like trophy husband.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m going to pay my own shit and be my own shit, but like, I&rsquo;m just going to worry</p>
<p>about looking cute and going to branch and drinking Xanax smoothies.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s going to be a point in my life where all I focus on is my appearance, but</p>
<p>maybe, I don&rsquo;t fucking know.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m just too like, my brain is too high maintenance for that.</p>
<p>I need more stimulation than just like eating, cleaning, working out, but people that work</p>
<p>out babe, they&rsquo;re so much more intentional about it than you fucking think.</p>
<p>When I tell you every meal is counted for and what I mean by counted for is they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>eat like five, six meals a day and they will weigh out every single thing they eat.</p>
<p>I have to do this too, but these people with really, really like perfect bodies and are</p>
<p>in super good shape, they have to do this like 10 times more strict than I do it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll like fuck around and weigh my rice and weigh my chicken and I just try to make</p>
<p>sure I eat like four to five times a day, make sure I get my protein in, but no, these</p>
<p>people want their fucking numbers hit and they will do what it takes to make sure they</p>
<p>hit their goddamn numbers.</p>
<p>Like they don&rsquo;t fuck around.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t take chances.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t go out to eat.</p>
<p>They like do not fuck with that shit and if they do have a cheat day, it&rsquo;s once in a goddamn</p>
<p>while.</p>
<p>If you see really fit people that you see online posing with a cheeseburger or posing</p>
<p>with a pizza or like something, it&rsquo;s like bitch half the time they don&rsquo;t even eat it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to say it.</p>
<p>Half the time they don&rsquo;t even fucking eat the bad food that they&rsquo;re showing.</p>
<p>They just take the picture with it because they want to like be cute and be trendy.</p>
<p>But even if they do eat it, they&rsquo;re not eating it every day.</p>
<p>And let me tell you, when they go home, they are freaking the fuck out mentally because</p>
<p>they just had a piece of pizza.</p>
<p>They are like beating themselves up.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going on the Stairmaster for the next fucking week and they&rsquo;re fucking freaking</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>Oh my God, I ate a piece of pizza, I&rsquo;m gonna fucking kill myself.</p>
<p>Like they literally like are next level with the shit and all their meals are calculated</p>
<p>and planned.</p>
<p>What they eat is planned.</p>
<p>How they work out is planned.</p>
<p>They all got their little fucking notebook journal shit at the gym or they got the notes</p>
<p>in their phone.</p>
<p>Like every move they make is calculated and that is such a draining fucking life to live</p>
<p>because I tried to live it and I fucking hated it.</p>
<p>Like I have a balance.</p>
<p>So like I&rsquo;m very calculated with most things that I eat, but like I give myself a little</p>
<p>bit of freedom, you know, like I make sure I hit what I need to hit for like my protein</p>
<p>goal and my calories, but like I&rsquo;m not as strict as these people.</p>
<p>So like, yeah, I look like I just have fun and I do whatever and I drink because I post</p>
<p>a lot of like shit with me drinking alcohol.</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all, when I drink, I make sure that I can and I make sure it&rsquo;s not going to throw off</p>
<p>my fucking calories.</p>
<p>So I know that one shot of tequila because I only drink tequila.</p>
<p>One shot of tequila is a hundred calories.</p>
<p>So I know that going into the shit.</p>
<p>So I do not order sugary drinks.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t order anything that&rsquo;s like a drink.</p>
<p>I rarely order a drink, but if I do, it&rsquo;s tequila soda with lime because that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>zero calories of like the liquid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the hundred from the tequila, a hundred calories from the tequila.</p>
<p>So if I know I like to have between eight to 10 shots throughout the night because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>very big, it takes a lot to get me drunk and I have a tolerance like a motherfucker.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s more than that, but that&rsquo;s 800 to a thousand calories I know I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to spend from drinking.</p>
<p>So I will do extra cardio at the gym and I will eat a little bit less throughout the</p>
<p>day.</p>
<p>So like I&rsquo;ll do 500 calories of cardio after my workout, 400, 500, whatever.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll eat a little bit less throughout the day so that I know when I go out that</p>
<p>night, I&rsquo;m not fucking up my calories and I&rsquo;m not going to wake up fucking fat.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m serious.</p>
<p>Like I take that into consideration of like my goals.</p>
<p>But other people that work out really, really hard and have these perfect fucking bodies,</p>
<p>take it to the next level.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m not even going to drink tonight because I don&rsquo;t want it to ruin my</p>
<p>workout tomorrow because tomorrow I&rsquo;m not going to feel as energized.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to sleep as good tonight, so I&rsquo;m not going to have as good of a workout</p>
<p>tomorrow.</p>
<p>If I feel hungover, I&rsquo;m going to fuck up like what I&rsquo;m going to do tomorrow.</p>
<p>Like these people don&rsquo;t even go out and if they do, they have one or two drinks.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t get drunk.</p>
<p>They have like the slightest little buzz, but like that&rsquo;s it because they don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to fuck their shit up, which is totally like respectable.</p>
<p>And I love that people have that level of self-discipline, but they don&rsquo;t show that.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t fucking show that online.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t show how strict they&rsquo;re actually being and they pretend that they like their</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll show a couple of meals, they&rsquo;ll show a couple of things, but they don&rsquo;t show anything</p>
<p>else that goes into it.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t show the mental side of it.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t show how they have to sacrifice having fun and going to restaurants and going</p>
<p>out and having friends and having a fucking social life.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t show that.</p>
<p>They literally show their self eating their fucking meals, going to the gym and watching</p>
<p>Netflix.</p>
<p>Boring, but like that&rsquo;s very respectable, but that&rsquo;s the price that comes with having</p>
<p>a perfect body like that.</p>
<p>And then there are some people that have really, really good bodies that party a lot.</p>
<p>And let me fucking tell you, they are a lot more calculated about it than you think.</p>
<p>So just how I said, I&rsquo;ll do the cardio, they will too.</p>
<p>Or they won&rsquo;t eat that fucking day because you&rsquo;ll get drunker faster on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>So I used to have a friend that was super muscular and she was in such good fucking</p>
<p>shape and I was like, bitch, how the fuck are you in such good shape?</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t fucking eat barely and you drink all weekend and she would eat very clean</p>
<p>throughout the week.</p>
<p>Very, very, very clean.</p>
<p>Her fucking chicken, she would eat high protein, but on the weekends she wouldn&rsquo;t eat much</p>
<p>so that the alcohol would hit her harder so she could get to the same level of drunk with</p>
<p>half the calories.</p>
<p>But then she wasn&rsquo;t even eating the calories like she was still in a negative even though</p>
<p>she was drinking.</p>
<p>So she was able to drink Saturday, Friday and Saturday and be fine.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like there are a lot more calculated than you fucking think.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t know every micro detail of people&rsquo;s lives, bro.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s so much more that goes into these people with the perfect fucking bodies</p>
<p>than you realize.</p>
<p>But a lot of them just make it seem like it&rsquo;s accident or like they, you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so much harder than you think because as soon as you get on your fitness journey</p>
<p>or you try and start counting a macro or a calorie, you&rsquo;re going to realize, God damn</p>
<p>this is annoying.</p>
<p>This is fucking annoying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tired of this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tired of this grandpa.</p>
<p>But literally that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m at.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;ve done it so long.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done it since I&rsquo;m 14 and I&rsquo;ve just like had a general understanding of like what the</p>
<p>fuck&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not going to commit my life to being like miserable.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;d rather prioritize looking not in perfect shape and still enjoy living my life,</p>
<p>you know, but some people looking in perfect shape is their enjoyment.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all subjective and it&rsquo;s up to you.</p>
<p>But my whole point about all this fucking shit is that people don&rsquo;t get muscular and</p>
<p>get in good shape by accident.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re training their fucking ass off and they&rsquo;re being very, very calculated about</p>
<p>what they eat, when they eat, how they exercise.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much more that goes into it and it&rsquo;s a lot harder than they&rsquo;re going to fucking</p>
<p>warn you for.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why so many people fall off the wagon because they ain&rsquo;t prepared for what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coming.</p>
<p>Like you think that you just need to hop on a wagon and keep rolling.</p>
<p>Really bitch, you got to hop on a train.</p>
<p>Like you got to fucking, you got to elevate and like it&rsquo;s so much more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a wagon, it&rsquo;s a train babe.</p>
<p>So hop the fuck on the right one.</p>
<p>So one more idea that just popped into my head, okay, this one is like off the cuff,</p>
<p>but my last one is coming up next.</p>
<p>But this one is like another example of all this shit is like studying when you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>school.</p>
<p>I dealt with this shit a lot where everybody just seemed to do so good on the tests.</p>
<p>And I was like, what the fuck, how?</p>
<p>Like there was a couple of people that always got A&rsquo;s and I&rsquo;m like, how the motherfuck are</p>
<p>you getting an A?</p>
<p>Like I studied my ass off for this and I got a C, what?</p>
<p>Like when you get into nursing school, there&rsquo;s a whole, it&rsquo;s a whole different way of like</p>
<p>taking tests.</p>
<p>Like you have to completely change the way that you answer questions and go about taking</p>
<p>a test because every answer is right, but it&rsquo;s about which one&rsquo;s the most right.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s besides the point.</p>
<p>So after tests and shit, like I would go around to the people that made A&rsquo;s and I would ask</p>
<p>them like, what the fuck are you studying?</p>
<p>Because I studied my ass off and I&rsquo;m still doing bad.</p>
<p>And they would just be like so aloof about it.</p>
<p>Like, oh, I read the PowerPoints.</p>
<p>I studied the PowerPoints and I&rsquo;m like, okay.</p>
<p>So like, huh, I did too.</p>
<p>So what do you mean you studied the PowerPoints and you read a little bit in the textbook?</p>
<p>Like I fucking did that too, but they didn&rsquo;t tell me how long they read the PowerPoints</p>
<p>and how long and how many times they read the textbook because I stopped asking people</p>
<p>for advice and I just decided I&rsquo;m going to figure this fucking shit out on my own because</p>
<p>what was working for everybody else was not working for me.</p>
<p>Typical how my fucking life goes.</p>
<p>So I cracked down and I was like, you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to study these motherfucking PowerPoints for my next test.</p>
<p>And I sat down and I read the PowerPoints every single day, three times a day.</p>
<p>So I was spending around four hours a day reading these fucking PowerPoints basically</p>
<p>and studying for my tests for like the week before.</p>
<p>Like bitch, when I tell you I studied, I studied and then I made a fucking A because yeah,</p>
<p>all they told me was they read the PowerPoints.</p>
<p>But what I had to learn for myself was how many times.</p>
<p>Like I memorized the fucking PowerPoints by reading them three times a day for a week,</p>
<p>but it took me four hours a day to do that shit.</p>
<p>So like they just say I read the PowerPoints, but it&rsquo;s a lot harder than you think.</p>
<p>It takes a lot more of, it&rsquo;s like more than just reading the PowerPoints.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s studying the PowerPoints.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fucking memorizing them.</p>
<p>Like when I went to real estate school and I took my real estate exam, I passed it on</p>
<p>the first try because I knew about studying, like going through nursing school.</p>
<p>I learned like, yeah, you might be studying the right thing, but you&rsquo;re not like learning</p>
<p>it enough.</p>
<p>Like you need to like drill that shit into your brain.</p>
<p>So when I went into real estate school, I knew how to study and I was the only person</p>
<p>in my real estate class that passed the exam the first time because I read my entire textbook</p>
<p>again before I took the test.</p>
<p>So I sat down for a weekend for three days and I did nothing but read my fucking textbook</p>
<p>cover to cover and made sure I understood everything in that fucking book.</p>
<p>And I did that because I knew that&rsquo;s what it takes to pass a fucking test.</p>
<p>Like if I really wanted to prepare and make sure I didn&rsquo;t have to take it twice, I did</p>
<p>what it took.</p>
<p>But most people were not willing to put in the three days of effort that I did to reading</p>
<p>that fucking textbook.</p>
<p>Who wants to read a textbook?</p>
<p>Nobody, you know?</p>
<p>But when people would ask me, what did I do?</p>
<p>I could have just said, Oh, I read over my textbook and they would have thought, Oh,</p>
<p>okay.</p>
<p>I could have just like go scan over a couple of things and read a couple of sections.</p>
<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t think that I read over the entire textbook.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>So like people that are really smart and making A&rsquo;s in class are doing a lot more work than</p>
<p>you fucking think.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a lot more intentional with it.</p>
<p>And I hate when they hide their fucking secrets and they hide what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Like motherfucker, if you&rsquo;re studying four hours a day, tell me, tell me that so I can</p>
<p>go do that.</p>
<p>So the last thing I want to talk about, people are more intentional about than you realize</p>
<p>is being positive and having a positive mindset.</p>
<p>So someone like me, I take a lot of time to look into things and journal about things.</p>
<p>And I take a lot of time looking into other perspectives.</p>
<p>Like my brain doesn&rsquo;t just work the way it does.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t just automatically see the bright side of shit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how our brains are wired one, but two, it seems so effortless with me.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, I vent.</p>
<p>Yeah, I rant.</p>
<p>But like, I always have a good point.</p>
<p>I always have a positive note to end on.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not just how I am.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve had to teach myself to be and what I&rsquo;ve had to like, work toward.</p>
<p>Because I get sad a lot.</p>
<p>And I go into the way that I feel.</p>
<p>I spend a lot more time with my emotions and in my head than people realize.</p>
<p>And my outlook on life was earned.</p>
<p>It was grown.</p>
<p>I achieved this like it&rsquo;s not something that just happened to me like, oh, he&rsquo;s just he</p>
<p>was just born smart.</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t know shit when I was born.</p>
<p>I was a fucking little neck and mole rat.</p>
<p>Basically, that&rsquo;s what babies are.</p>
<p>Like I just I didn&rsquo;t know shit.</p>
<p>Like I had to learn it.</p>
<p>But people that are positive are a lot more intentional about being positive than you</p>
<p>think like they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re intentionally looking for other perspectives.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking for other viewpoints.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking for other ways to see a situation so that they can feel better about it.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t just automatically feel good about everything all the time.</p>
<p>People that are very positive, and that are able to stay motivated and keep going and</p>
<p>just have a like better mood, I guess they&rsquo;re intentional about that.</p>
<p>They put a lot of fucking effort and work into that.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re someone that&rsquo;s like, Okay, I want to feel better.</p>
<p>And I want to change the way that I think, bitch, buckle up, that shit&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna fill up journals like every fucking couple weeks with shit that you just pour</p>
<p>out of your brain.</p>
<p>Like all the negative shit has to come out all the old perspectives that you hold have</p>
<p>to come out.</p>
<p>And then you have to question yourself for the new perspectives.</p>
<p>And those will fill your fucking journal up.</p>
<p>You have to be intentional about seeing different perspectives and experiencing different shit,</p>
<p>because your experiences come from your perception.</p>
<p>So if you change your perception of how you&rsquo;re looking at something, it will change the way</p>
<p>you feel about it 100%.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a very intentional process.</p>
<p>It becomes easier as you do it more, but it&rsquo;s still very much intentional.</p>
<p>You have to check yourself, you have to choose to think in certain directions, and about</p>
<p>certain things and in certain ways.</p>
<p>Like people that are just positive Polly&rsquo;s are not positive Polly is just fucking because</p>
<p>like, oh, that&rsquo;s just how they are.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not negative Nancy, just because she was born like that.</p>
<p>Like you, it takes effort to be the opposite.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m gonna leave this off.</p>
<p>I have yelled at you guys enough.</p>
<p>I hope you guys like this episode.</p>
<p>If you like this podcast, I just have one request.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that you go leave me a five star rating.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>If you want to keep up with me all of my social media will be linked in the description of</p>
<p>this podcast.</p>
<p>Also, if you are interested in one on one coaching with me, I have now created an application</p>
<p>process so it&rsquo;s no longer just free to schedule.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing applications now to keep up with the demand because it just got too high.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m screening people basically to see who&rsquo;s a good fit and who&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Because I want to work with action takers.</p>
<p>I want to work with people that are serious about transforming their life.</p>
<p>Because the shit that I say y&rsquo;all know, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s for.</p>
<p>And where I specialize is with the people that have been looking for answers they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>find and the people that have been trying shit and it&rsquo;s just not working.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the person that those people can go to.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in that, I will put the link to the application in the description</p>
<p>box also.</p>
<p>And I want to make it very clear that you&rsquo;ve already got what it takes to get through what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dealing with or to improve your life or to reach your goals.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll help you see that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to be a lot easier when you got me in your corner because that&rsquo;s exactly</p>
<p>how I want it to feel.</p>
<p>I want it to feel like you have someone that has your back and like I&rsquo;m in your corner</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m there for you and I&rsquo;m there to do shit with you.</p>
<p>But anyways, thank you so much for listening.</p>
<p>Please stay safe and take care of yourself.</p>
<p>And I will talk to you next Sunday.</p>
