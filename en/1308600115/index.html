    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Rick Rubin.</p>
<p>Rick Rubin is credited with being one of the most creative</p>
<p>and prolific music producers of all time.</p>
<p>The range of artists with whom he&rsquo;s worked with</p>
<p>and discovered is absolutely staggering,</p>
<p>ranging from artists such as LL Cool J,</p>
<p>Public Enemy, Minor Threat, Fugazi, Beastie Boys,</p>
<p>Jesus and Mary Chain, Jay-Z, Red Hot Chili Peppers,</p>
<p>Metallica, Green Day, Tom Petty, System of a Down,</p>
<p>Joe Strummer, Kanye West, Johnny Cash,</p>
<p>Adele, and many, many more.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, therefore,</p>
<p>Rick is considered somewhat of an enigma.</p>
<p>That is, people want to know how it is</p>
<p>that one individual is able to extract</p>
<p>the best creative artistry from so many different people</p>
<p>in so many different genres of music.</p>
<p>Well, as today&rsquo;s discussion reveals,</p>
<p>Rick&rsquo;s expertise in the creative process</p>
<p>extends well beyond music.</p>
<p>In fact, our conversation takes us into the realm</p>
<p>of what the creative process is specifically</p>
<p>and generally across domains,</p>
<p>including music, of course,</p>
<p>but also writing, film, science,</p>
<p>and essentially all domains in which new original thought,</p>
<p>ideas, and production of anything becomes important.</p>
<p>Our conversation ventures from abstract themes</p>
<p>such as what is creativity and where does it stem from</p>
<p>to the more concrete everyday tool-based approaches</p>
<p>to creativity, including those that Rick himself uses</p>
<p>and that he&rsquo;s seen other people use to great success.</p>
<p>That took us down some incredible avenues</p>
<p>ranging from a discussion about the subconscious</p>
<p>to how the subconscious interacts with our conscious mind</p>
<p>and how the subconscious and conscious mind interact</p>
<p>with nature around us and within us.</p>
<p>Indeed, our conversation got rather scientific at times,</p>
<p>but all with an eye and an ear</p>
<p>toward understanding the practical tools</p>
<p>that any and all of us can use</p>
<p>in order to access the creative process.</p>
<p>We also spend some time talking about Rick&rsquo;s new book,</p>
<p>which is all about creativity and ways to access creativity.</p>
<p>The title of the book is</p>
<p>The Creative Act, A Way of Being by Rick Rubin.</p>
<p>This is a book that I&rsquo;ve now read three times</p>
<p>from cover to cover, and I&rsquo;m now reading it a fourth time</p>
<p>because it is so rich with wisdom and information</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m applying in multiple domains of my life,</p>
<p>not just my work, but my everyday life.</p>
<p>I cannot recommend it highly enough.</p>
<p>Rick has an incredible ability to translate</p>
<p>his understanding of the creative process</p>
<p>in a way that is meaningful for anybody.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in music, if you&rsquo;re a musician,</p>
<p>it will certainly be meaningful for you,</p>
<p>but it is not about music.</p>
<p>It is about the creative process.</p>
<p>And so whether or not you consider yourself</p>
<p>somebody creative or not,</p>
<p>or whether or not you seek to be more creative,</p>
<p>Rick&rsquo;s book and today&rsquo;s conversation sheds light</p>
<p>on what I believe to be the fundamental features</p>
<p>of what makes us human beings.</p>
<p>That is what allows us, unlike other animals,</p>
<p>to look out on the landscape around us,</p>
<p>to examine our inner landscape,</p>
<p>and to come up with truly novel ideas that thrill us,</p>
<p>entertain us, entertain other people, scare us,</p>
<p>make us laugh, make us cry.</p>
<p>All the things that make life rich</p>
<p>are essentially contained in the creative process.</p>
<p>And to be able to sit down and learn from the Rick Rubin,</p>
<p>how the creative process emerges in him</p>
<p>and his observations about how it can best emerge in others</p>
<p>is and was truly a gift.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m excited to share his knowledge with you today.</p>
<p>One thing that you&rsquo;ll quickly come to notice</p>
<p>about today&rsquo;s conversation</p>
<p>is that Rick is incredibly generous with his knowledge</p>
<p>about the creative process.</p>
<p>In fact, he very graciously and spontaneously,</p>
<p>I should add,</p>
<p>offered to answer your questions about creativity.</p>
<p>So if you have questions</p>
<p>about the creative process for Rick,</p>
<p>please put those in the comment section on YouTube.</p>
<p>And in order to make those questions</p>
<p>a bit easier for me to find,</p>
<p>please put question for Rick Rubin in capitals,</p>
<p>then colon or dash, whichever you choose,</p>
<p>and then put your question there.</p>
<p>I do ask that you keep the questions relatively short</p>
<p>so that I can ask Rick</p>
<p>as many of those questions as possible.</p>
<p>We will record that conversation</p>
<p>and we will post it as a clip</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab Clips channel.</p>
<p>Before we begin,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Maui Nui,</p>
<p>which I can confidently say is the most nutrient dense</p>
<p>and delicious red meat available.</p>
<p>Maui Nui spent nearly a decade</p>
<p>building a USDA certified wild harvesting system</p>
<p>to help balance invasive deer populations</p>
<p>on the Island of Maui.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked before on this podcast</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve had guests on this podcast</p>
<p>that have emphasized the critical role</p>
<p>of getting quality protein,</p>
<p>not just for muscle repair and protein synthesis,</p>
<p>but also for repair of all tissues,</p>
<p>including brain tissue on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>And the general rule of thumb for that</p>
<p>is one gram of quality protein</p>
<p>per pound of body weight per day.</p>
<p>With Maui Nui meats,</p>
<p>you can accomplish that very easily</p>
<p>and you can do that without ingesting an excess of calories,</p>
<p>which is also critical for immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>I should say that Maui Nui meats</p>
<p>are not only extremely high quality,</p>
<p>but they are also delicious.</p>
<p>I particularly like their jerky,</p>
<p>so their venison jerky.</p>
<p>I also have had Maui Nui venison in various recipes,</p>
<p>including ground venison, some venison steaks,</p>
<p>and I love the taste of the venison.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s lean, but it doesn&rsquo;t taste overly lean or dry at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly delicious.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;d like to try Maui Nui venison,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes custom nootropics.</p>
<p>And as many of you have probably heard me say before,</p>
<p>I am not a fan of the word nootropics</p>
<p>because nootropics means smart drugs.</p>
<p>And frankly, the brain doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>The brain has neural circuits for focus.</p>
<p>It also has neural circuits for creativity</p>
<p>and neural circuits for task switching</p>
<p>and for imagination and for memory.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a neural circuit for being smart.</p>
<p>And therefore the word nootropics</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really apply to anything specific</p>
<p>neurobiologically speaking.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this</p>
<p>and therefore has designed custom nootropics</p>
<p>that are tailored to your unique needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for over a year now</p>
<p>and their nootropic formulas</p>
<p>have been a game changer for me,</p>
<p>in particular in the realm of cognitive work.</p>
<p>My go-to formula for when I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>any kind of cognitive work is their clarity formula.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one I&rsquo;ve been using most often lately.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Thesis customized nootropics,</p>
<p>you can go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll take a brief three-minute quiz</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Woop.</p>
<p>Woop is a fitness wearable device</p>
<p>that tracks your daily activity and sleep,</p>
<p>but goes beyond activity and sleep tracking</p>
<p>to provide real-time feedback</p>
<p>on how to adjust your training and sleep schedules</p>
<p>in order to feel and perform better.</p>
<p>Six months ago, I started working with Woop</p>
<p>as a member of their scientific advisory council</p>
<p>as a way to help Woop advance their mission</p>
<p>of unlocking human performance.</p>
<p>And as a Woop user, I&rsquo;ve experienced firsthand</p>
<p>the health benefits of their technology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear based on quality research</p>
<p>that Woop can inform you how well you&rsquo;re sleeping,</p>
<p>how to change your sleep habits,</p>
<p>how to change your activity habits,</p>
<p>even how to modify different aspects of your nutrition,</p>
<p>exercise, sleep, and lifestyle</p>
<p>in order to maximize your mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>So whether or not you&rsquo;re an athlete</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re exercising simply for health,</p>
<p>Woop can really help you understand</p>
<p>how your body functions under different conditions</p>
<p>and how to really program your schedule,</p>
<p>nutrition, and exercise,</p>
<p>and many other factors of your life</p>
<p>in order to really optimize your health and performance,</p>
<p>including your cognition.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in trying Woop,</p>
<p>you can go to joinwoop, spelled W-H-O-O-P,</p>

<p>And now for my discussion with Rick Rubin.</p>
<p>Great to have you here today, Rick.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pleasure.</p>
<p>So of all the topics in science</p>
<p>and in particular in neuroscience,</p>
<p>I confess that creativity</p>
<p>is the most difficult one to capture</p>
<p>because you can find papers,</p>
<p>scientific studies, that is,</p>
<p>on convergent thinking versus divergent thinking.</p>
<p>And there are definitions to these.</p>
<p>I mean, they take on different forms,</p>
<p>but in a strict definition form,</p>
<p>it seems that creativity has something to do</p>
<p>with either rearranging existing elements</p>
<p>or coming up with new elements.</p>
<p>But as I went into your book,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve done twice, I&rsquo;ve read it twice,</p>
<p>and by the way, I feel so blessed and honored</p>
<p>to have gotten an early copy from you,</p>
<p>or a final copy early, that is.</p>
<p>But having gone through it twice,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now convinced that there may not actually be</p>
<p>an internal source of creativity that exists on its own.</p>
<p>Right, and the example that you give</p>
<p>that for me really is serving as an anchor,</p>
<p>and tell me if I&rsquo;m wrong here,</p>
<p>is this idea that ideas and creativity</p>
<p>are a little bit like a cloud.</p>
<p>If you look at it at one moment,</p>
<p>you might think that it looks like one thing,</p>
<p>where it has a certain shape and texture,</p>
<p>but then you look at it a moment later,</p>
<p>it could be quite a bit different,</p>
<p>and if you look at it an hour later,</p>
<p>it very well could be gone.</p>
<p>And the reason I think that serves as such a powerful hook</p>
<p>for me to think about creativity</p>
<p>and why I think neuroscientists and scientists in general</p>
<p>have never actually captured a way</p>
<p>to even talk about creativity,</p>
<p>stems from somebody that you knew in person,</p>
<p>but that, as you know, I greatly admire.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have many heroes,</p>
<p>but I would put Joe Strummer</p>
<p>among the short list of heroes that I have.</p>
<p>And I remember once an interview with him,</p>
<p>fairly disjointed, he was sort of off in different tangents</p>
<p>that I couldn&rsquo;t follow, but at one point,</p>
<p>he just kind of blurted out that if you have an idea,</p>
<p>you have to write it down,</p>
<p>and you may end up throwing it away,</p>
<p>but if you wait, it will be gone.</p>
<p>And I remember that, and as a consequence,</p>
<p>I have a whole system that I use to try and capture ideas,</p>
<p>but what are your thoughts on what Joe said,</p>
<p>this cloud idea that comes up in one form</p>
<p>in one area of the book,</p>
<p>but then I think is thread throughout the book</p>
<p>in different ways, how did that come to you?</p>
<p>And how does it serve you in trying to,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say extract, but trying to access creativity?</p>
<p>I think the best way to think about it is like a dream.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, if you think about your dreams,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t necessarily make sense.</p>
<p>When you wake up, you might remember part,</p>
<p>but not the whole thing.</p>
<p>Then if you start writing them down, they&rsquo;ll come back,</p>
<p>and they may not make sense to you.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be a series of abstract images,</p>
<p>and maybe someday in the future,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to look back and understand what they mean,</p>
<p>and maybe not.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sort of how the art making process works,</p>
<p>is like we&rsquo;re making things,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re looking for a feeling in ourselves,</p>
<p>and it could be a feeling of excitement or enthusiasm,</p>
<p>a feeling of interest, a feeling of curiosity,</p>
<p>I want to know more, feeling of leaning forward.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re following that energy in our body</p>
<p>when we feel there&rsquo;s something here,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something here, I want to know more,</p>
<p>I want to know more, I want to know more.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not, I&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s not an intellectual process,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a different thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s hard even to talk about it,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so elusive, you know?</p>
<p>Recently, I was listening to a podcast</p>
<p>by our friend Lex Friedman.</p>
<p>I think it was an episode with Balaji Srinivasan,</p>
<p>where this, with Balaji, who&rsquo;s a investor type guy,</p>
<p>thinker type guy, this is like an eight hour episode.</p>
<p>He says something at the beginning</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d love your thoughts on.</p>
<p>He said, look, you know, we can train a rat</p>
<p>to lever press every other time,</p>
<p>or to expect reward on every even number press,</p>
<p>or every odd number press,</p>
<p>or even every fifth number press.</p>
<p>But a human and a rat can&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>for like prime number presses.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t actually train that.</p>
<p>And then you think about the reward systems</p>
<p>and the way that we follow life</p>
<p>from when we get up until we go to sleep.</p>
<p>And what he said is, the fact that we can&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>means that we may not actually be in touch</p>
<p>with the best schedules of doing things.</p>
<p>Like every time I&rsquo;m thirsty, I take a sip.</p>
<p>I assume that&rsquo;s the right way to do it,</p>
<p>but it might not be optimal, right?</p>
<p>Optimal for whatever purpose.</p>
<p>When I was reading your book,</p>
<p>I was thinking about there&rsquo;s a set of things to follow,</p>
<p>things to pay attention to.</p>
<p>You talk about this, things to access,</p>
<p>that none of the creative process</p>
<p>comes from just within us.</p>
<p>It can, but it&rsquo;s always being fed by things outside of it.</p>
<p>And so what I started to do</p>
<p>is the second time I read through the book</p>
<p>was think about it through the lens</p>
<p>of what Balaji was saying was that</p>
<p>there may not even be a language</p>
<p>for this thing that we call accessing creativity.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a process,</p>
<p>but that language in the form of words</p>
<p>is a little bit like trying to use even numbers</p>
<p>to try and access prime numbers.</p>
<p>The math becomes so convoluted</p>
<p>that we end up in a conversation like this</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m confident we can get to the kernels of it</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s remarkable about the book is that you do.</p>
<p>You show and inform the process,</p>
<p>but there may not be a English or any other language</p>
<p>for saying do this, then this, then this, then this,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll have something of creative value.</p>
<p>Does that capture it?</p>
<p>Yes, I think language is insufficient</p>
<p>to drill down on creativity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s closer to magic than it is science.</p>
<p>So when kids come into the world,</p>
<p>do you think that they have better access</p>
<p>to this creative process than we do as adults?</p>
<p>Because we start to impart role plays</p>
<p>and books like, will it get likes?</p>
<p>Will people like it?</p>
<p>But also like all the things that are available to us</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not paying attention to,</p>
<p>like the texture of this table, right?</p>
<p>They, we&rsquo;re discarding things kind of systematically.</p>
<p>We get quote unquote set in our ways.</p>
<p>Do you think kids are more, are just by definition</p>
<p>and by design more creative than adults?</p>
<p>Yes, kids are, they&rsquo;re open and they have no baggage.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have any belief system.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know how things are supposed to work.</p>
<p>They just see what is.</p>
<p>And if we pay attention to what is we learn,</p>
<p>we learn much more than if we,</p>
<p>most of us select from an endless number of data points</p>
<p>available to us to, well, as a species,</p>
<p>to make sure that we don&rsquo;t die and to procreate</p>
<p>and to feed ourselves are probably</p>
<p>the primary functions first.</p>
<p>And then, and then we learn things</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s right and what&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>And we learn things about how to do certain things</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re inspired by someone who makes something we love</p>
<p>and we want to do it the way they do it.</p>
<p>And all of those things undermine the purity</p>
<p>of the creative process.</p>
<p>They can be tools to build your skillset</p>
<p>to be able to do it yourself.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re a singer,</p>
<p>you might imitate a singer you really like for a while</p>
<p>to get good at it.</p>
<p>And then eventually come to find your own voice.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t always start with your own voice.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re three years old or five years old</p>
<p>and you try singing, you&rsquo;re not singing like anyone else.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re singing with your own voice.</p>
<p>And when you make something,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making it based on not knowing.</p>
<p>And I think I had the advantage early in my career</p>
<p>of starting making music without any experience,</p>
<p>which was helpful because I didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what rules I was breaking.</p>
<p>And so it wasn&rsquo;t intentional breaking of rules.</p>
<p>I just did what seemed right to me.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t realize that I was doing things</p>
<p>that other people wouldn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>I mean, there is this idea that there are no new ideas.</p>
<p>I sort of disagree because every once in a while</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll see or hear something</p>
<p>that at least seems different enough.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a combination of a new combination</p>
<p>of existing ideas presented in a new way.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but I will say it does seem like</p>
<p>the things that are most interesting to me</p>
<p>have a series of familiar elements joined together</p>
<p>in a way that it&rsquo;s creating something</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve never seen before.</p>
<p>You mentioned that when you are close to</p>
<p>or you see hints of creativity,</p>
<p>that is of real value, that it&rsquo;s a feeling.</p>
<p>And I also believe that the body</p>
<p>is a great source of information,</p>
<p>which once people realize that the brain, of course,</p>
<p>is in the skull, but the nervous system</p>
<p>extends everywhere in the body,</p>
<p>the whole mind-body thing just falls away.</p>
<p>Philosophers have argued about this forever,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a silly argument.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also true that if, God forbid,</p>
<p>I were to amputate all my limbs, have them amputated,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d fundamentally still be me, right?</p>
<p>The same is not true if we took out</p>
<p>a big enough chunk of my brain and I still survived,</p>
<p>I would be fundamentally different human being.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d still have the same name and identity</p>
<p>and social security number,</p>
<p>but I would behave very differently.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe better.</p>
<p>The signals from the body,</p>
<p>we know or at least we assume are pretty generic.</p>
<p>Like I can think of 50 different ways</p>
<p>or 100 ways that we could talk about creativity today</p>
<p>and we could define it and redefine it</p>
<p>and carve it up and serve it up like sushi</p>
<p>in a bunch of different ways.</p>
<p>But the body sends signals that most of us</p>
<p>we have a kind of coarse understanding of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, my stomach hurts or my stomach feels good</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m not sensing my stomach.</p>
<p>Or, oh, that feels good, it feels warm, it feels cold.</p>
<p>Most of us aren&rsquo;t trained in understanding</p>
<p>how to interpret those signals.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like you have a few vowels, a few syllables,</p>
<p>and there isn&rsquo;t a lot more.</p>
<p>Whereas when we talk about our thoughts and our experiences,</p>
<p>depending on how hyperverbal somebody is</p>
<p>and how much emphasis they put on different sounds,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of near infinite, right?</p>
<p>Not infinite, but near infinite.</p>
<p>So for you personally, when you know</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re on the end of a thread of creativity,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re listening to an artist</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re hearing something and you&rsquo;re like there</p>
<p>and your antennae start to deflect in a certain way, right?</p>
<p>Do you feel that in your body as a recognizable sensation</p>
<p>or is it a thought and a sensation?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a feeling in my body.</p>
<p>Is it localized?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a feeling of,</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s like a surge of energy.</p>
<p>Do you remember the first time you experienced that?</p>
<p>Probably hearing the Beatles</p>
<p>when I was three or four years old.</p>
<p>Three or four years old?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is there something wrong with me</p>
<p>that the Beatles have never done it for me?</p>
<p>No, maybe just weren&rsquo;t exposed at the right time</p>
<p>in the right way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no right or wrong way.</p>
<p>And everyone, I can love the Beatles and you cannot,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re both right.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s not a-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad we can still be friends.</p>
<p>I was a little concerned.</p>
<p>I was a little scared to ask you that question.</p>
<p>I know my taste in music is a little bit obscure</p>
<p>and kind of fragmentary, but okay, good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always felt like, gosh,</p>
<p>there must be something wrong with me.</p>
<p>I like their songs, but there&rsquo;s no juice for me there.</p>
<p>I think maybe we&rsquo;ll watch,</p>
<p>there was an eight part series called</p>
<p>The Beatles Anthology, which is out of print,</p>
<p>but I can try to find it somewhere</p>
<p>and we can watch that together.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;ll make the case for the Beatles.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I mean, nothing against them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, and I&rsquo;m always bothering you for story,</p>
<p>but like Ramones, I saw that and I was like, wow,</p>
<p>like Genes, Aviators,</p>
<p>everyone had to change their last name to Ramone.</p>
<p>A lot of them hated each other.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much drama in there and three chords and just,</p>
<p>but to me, it just was like, wow,</p>
<p>like kids from New York, that energy.</p>
<p>So I think different things for different people, right?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So that brings me to a question of</p>
<p>when something feels creatively right</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re sensing it and you&rsquo;re there,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say in the studio,</p>
<p>or maybe even you&rsquo;re listening to something</p>
<p>that somebody sent you,</p>
<p>how do you translate that given the absence of language?</p>
<p>How do you translate that into a conversation</p>
<p>with the artist?</p>
<p>And again, this could be about writing or comedy or,</p>
<p>you know, or science or podcasting for that matter.</p>
<p>How do you say that, keep going that way</p>
<p>when they might not even recognize that they did it?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m guessing a lot of times they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah, sometimes they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It depends when we&rsquo;re in the,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to be in a setting where as we&rsquo;re talking about it,</p>
<p>we can engage with it in that moment.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not much good.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I was producing your new record</p>
<p>and you played me something</p>
<p>and I had some thoughts about it.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be so helpful for me</p>
<p>to tell you what those were.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be better for us to wait till we were in a place</p>
<p>where we could try things and see where it goes.</p>
<p>So the first thing is I wouldn&rsquo;t rely on language to do it.</p>
<p>It would be more of a making a suggestion</p>
<p>of something that&rsquo;s actionable.</p>
<p>We try it and then we have more data</p>
<p>and either we&rsquo;re moving in a good direction</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re moving away from it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re moving towards it or away from it and we never know.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s always an experiment</p>
<p>and maybe a simple way to talk about it would be like</p>
<p>if I gave you two dishes of food and asked you to taste them</p>
<p>and tell me which one you like better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty, usually it&rsquo;s pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>When you have two choices, which you like better.</p>
<p>And I think most creativity can be boiled down to that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very different than I wonder how this is gonna</p>
<p>perform on certain social media platforms.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s different than what is it</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m tasting these two things</p>
<p>which is the one I wanna finish eating.</p>
<p>And if I would say, hmm, I like this one better</p>
<p>but it needs a little salt and then put a little salt on it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, hmm, maybe I put too much salt</p>
<p>and you know when you taste it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s that simple.</p>
<p>Being in tune enough with ourselves</p>
<p>to really know how we feel in the face of knowing</p>
<p>that other people might feel very differently</p>
<p>which is part of the challenge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if everyone tells you A, A, A, A, A, A, A</p>
<p>and you listen and you&rsquo;re like, that&rsquo;s B.</p>
<p>As an artist, it&rsquo;s important to be able to say,</p>
<p>to me it&rsquo;s B.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a disconnect because so much of, you know</p>
<p>when we go to school, it&rsquo;s to get us to follow the rules.</p>
<p>And in art, it&rsquo;s different because the rules are there</p>
<p>as a scaffolding to be chipped away as need be.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;re helpful, sometimes they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>And sometimes we&rsquo;ll even impose our own rules</p>
<p>to give something its shape.</p>
<p>So we can decide to make a, we&rsquo;re gonna make a painting</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re only gonna use green and red</p>
<p>are the only colors we&rsquo;re allowed to use.</p>
<p>We decide that in advance.</p>
<p>And then how do we solve the problem</p>
<p>knowing all we have is green and red?</p>
<p>Because otherwise if there&rsquo;s an infinite number</p>
<p>of choices, anything can be anything.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s sometimes more choices</p>
<p>is not better.</p>
<p>So limiting your palette to something manageable</p>
<p>forces you to solve problems in a different way.</p>
<p>Now in our digital age, music wise</p>
<p>you can make anything digitally.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, like in, there was a time when</p>
<p>if you didn&rsquo;t have a guitar in the studio</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t record guitar.</p>
<p>Or if you didn&rsquo;t, if you couldn&rsquo;t hire an orchestra</p>
<p>there couldn&rsquo;t be orchestra on your recording.</p>
<p>Now you can just call any of those things up.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s infinite choices and infinite choices</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t necessarily lead to better compositions</p>
<p>or better final works.</p>
<p>Understanding how you feel</p>
<p>in the face of other voices</p>
<p>without second guessing yourself</p>
<p>is probably the single most important</p>
<p>thing to practice as an artist</p>
<p>or skill set to develop as an artist</p>
<p>is to know how you feel and own your feelings.</p>
<p>And the key to that is not, I know.</p>
<p>So I know what&rsquo;s right for you.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I know for me.</p>
<p>And the reason I chose to be an artist</p>
<p>is to demonstrate this is how I see it.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m undermining my taste</p>
<p>for some commercial idea</p>
<p>or it defeats the whole purpose of doing this.</p>
<p>This is not, that&rsquo;s not what this process is about.</p>
<p>This process is I&rsquo;m doing me</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m showing you who I am</p>
<p>and you can like it or not,</p>
<p>but either way, this is still how I see it.</p>
<p>I love that because in science,</p>
<p>having trained graduate students,</p>
<p>having been a graduate student,</p>
<p>I was very blessed to have mentors.</p>
<p>One of who was a real icon of class.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s dead now.</p>
<p>Actually, all my advisors are dead.</p>
<p>Suicide, cancer, cancer.</p>
<p>The joke is you don&rsquo;t want me to work for you.</p>
<p>They were all had a morbid sense of humor.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re laughing about this someplace right now.</p>
<p>I thought you were going to say</p>
<p>they all ate the poison mushroom.</p>
<p>No, but the last one said to me,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the common denominator, Andrew.</p>
<p>And I thought, oh my goodness.</p>
<p>And he said, kind of just kidding, but not really.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a little bit eerie.</p>
<p>But in any case, he always said, his name was Ben.</p>
<p>He always said, the one thing I can&rsquo;t teach is taste.</p>
<p>And the one predictor I have of the people</p>
<p>who will never develop it</p>
<p>are the ones who are perfectionists</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re filtering their perfect,</p>
<p>perfectionists that filter their perfection</p>
<p>through the feedback of others.</p>
<p>He was always looking for the person</p>
<p>that was putting up a little bit</p>
<p>of a middle finger to feedback,</p>
<p>not so much that they would get things wrong</p>
<p>because it can be badly wrong in science.</p>
<p>You can be wrong for the right reasons,</p>
<p>but you can also be wrong for the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>But people that just had almost a compulsion</p>
<p>to do it their way or to believe in what they were doing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m hearing some of that,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m hearing that in what you&rsquo;re describing.</p>
<p>I also think that there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about the human empathic process or the emotional process</p>
<p>where when we see somebody doing something</p>
<p>and they seem to really not be paying attention</p>
<p>to what anyone else is doing.</p>
<p>I mean, like I said, the crazy person on the street</p>
<p>is one version of it where we go,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just in their experience and it&rsquo;s just crazy.</p>
<p>But when somebody seems to be enjoying themselves</p>
<p>or the emotion seems to be real,</p>
<p>I think there are a good fraction of people</p>
<p>who feel a kind of gravitational pull.</p>
<p>They go, yeah, that.</p>
<p>And the best example I have of this</p>
<p>is I remember growing up in the skateboard thing.</p>
<p>We were the first to start doing the baggy,</p>
<p>like sagging the clothes thing.</p>
<p>We got teased endlessly one year in school.</p>
<p>Then there was a bunch of hip hop that came out</p>
<p>and guys were wearing, sagging their jeans or their shorts.</p>
<p>Next year we come back and the very same people</p>
<p>who were making fun of us were all doing it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when it clicked for me.</p>
<p>I was like, most people don&rsquo;t actually know what they like.</p>
<p>They like what they like because of the certainty</p>
<p>of the people that they like.</p>
<p>And so the question then is in this landscape</p>
<p>of creative stuff, what&rsquo;s real, what&rsquo;s not real?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like whoever can create</p>
<p>the most convincing story,</p>
<p>at least captures a good fraction of audiences.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not what the creative artist needs to do.</p>
<p>They need to actually depart from that.</p>
<p>Do I have that right?</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re just two different things.</p>
<p>Like coming up with a story</p>
<p>with the purpose of pleasing someone else is a skillset,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more of a commercial endeavor</p>
<p>than an artistic endeavor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like tactical.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was seeing it in your book.</p>
<p>You describe, again, when you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about the creative processes, the cloud.</p>
<p>For me, again, it serves as such a powerful anchor.</p>
<p>And then I think about the biology,</p>
<p>the neurobiology of like strategy formation</p>
<p>or strategy implementation.</p>
<p>And then almost by sheer luck or miraculously,</p>
<p>I turn a few pages later into the book,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a description of how animals</p>
<p>that are trying to accomplish something,</p>
<p>eat, mate, find water,</p>
<p>accomplish the requirements of living,</p>
<p>it requires a narrow visual focus.</p>
<p>This is something my lab is kind of obsessed with</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been obsessed with.</p>
<p>And in that more narrow visual focus,</p>
<p>we know that the playbook becomes more narrow.</p>
<p>The rule set is more narrow.</p>
<p>Now, at some point,</p>
<p>in order to come up with a new creative idea,</p>
<p>that means broadening vision is essential in some way</p>
<p>or broadening thinking.</p>
<p>Well, it could either be a broadening or a narrowing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s changing the aperture from the standard.</p>
<p>The reason we do this is to present something new</p>
<p>that maybe you already knew, but didn&rsquo;t know you knew it.</p>
<p>And for that to be the case,</p>
<p>if to be looking at it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not unlike what a comedian does.</p>
<p>You know, comedian makes you laugh.</p>
<p>Usually what they&rsquo;re saying, it&rsquo;s outrageous,</p>
<p>but you know that it&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You know, just no one says it that way</p>
<p>or no one has said it that way before,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s always the truth in it that makes it funny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same idea as recognizing something</p>
<p>that seems really obvious once you see it,</p>
<p>but it seems like nobody else sees it</p>
<p>or no one else points it out.</p>
<p>And I feel like science is like that too,</p>
<p>because how much of science,</p>
<p>when once the light flashes over your head,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, I got it.</p>
<p>It just seems like, well, we knew that forever.</p>
<p>No one knew it, but do you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s so obvious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so obvious.</p>
<p>And I think another superpower of artists</p>
<p>is this accepting we don&rsquo;t know anything.</p>
<p>When we think we know things, that also limits our world.</p>
<p>We think we know, it&rsquo;s only like this.</p>
<p>This is all that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re mice in this little box.</p>
<p>But in reality, who&rsquo;s to say that&rsquo;s the case?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s to say any of the,</p>
<p>we could take all of the, what we believe in science now</p>
<p>and decide to throw all of that away and start from scratch.</p>
<p>And we would probably create a different,</p>
<p>a whole different one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a brief break</p>

<p>In an offline conversation one time,</p>
<p>you asked a good friend of mine</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been a guest on this podcast, Eddie Chang,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s Chair of Neurosurgery.</p>
<p>And I would place him in the top, top 1% of neuroscientists.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s pulling speech out of people</p>
<p>who are completely paralyzed with Locked-In Syndrome,</p>
<p>et cetera, and you asked him what percentage</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s contained in medical textbooks and training-</p>
<p>Today.</p>
<p>Today.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you went to medical school today</p>
<p>and you learned what was in the textbook,</p>
<p>what percentage of that information is accurate</p>
<p>and what percentage is not?</p>
<p>And he said, maybe half.</p>
<p>Right, and you asked, and what is the consequence of that?</p>
<p>And he said, incalculable.</p>
<p>And I completely agree.</p>
<p>And I asked him a second time</p>
<p>and he still came up with the same answer.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a good sign.</p>
<p>Reliability from experiment to the next is good.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that there is this idea</p>
<p>that we really know things.</p>
<p>In science, I mean, you&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve observed amazing discoveries from chance.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve observed amazing discoveries</p>
<p>from incredible bouts of hard work.</p>
<p>In both cases, people were spending a lot of time</p>
<p>in the lab.</p>
<p>Like, no one walked into the lab, saw something one day,</p>
<p>and had a Nobel Prize winning discovery</p>
<p>or fundamental discovery.</p>
<p>They were all hanging out in lab a lot.</p>
<p>Just some of them came up with something</p>
<p>that they didn&rsquo;t expect.</p>
<p>Others were drilling toward an answer.</p>
<p>And in all those cases, when the breakthroughs happen,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing, I don&rsquo;t know this,</p>
<p>that considering we assume this information,</p>
<p>then this discovery is true</p>
<p>based on everything that came before it.</p>
<p>But if everything that came before it is wrong,</p>
<p>then the discoveries are probably built on a,</p>
<p>do you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the context,</p>
<p>everything that happens takes into account</p>
<p>that the context that it&rsquo;s sitting in,</p>
<p>it fits in that context.</p>
<p>Maybe that context isn&rsquo;t right.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m saying we&rsquo;re too close to most things</p>
<p>in thinking when we think we know things,</p>
<p>where there are a lot of assumptions that go into it.</p>
<p>And that any new discoveries are essentially built</p>
<p>on top of these beliefs, you know?</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re beliefs.</p>
<p>I remember, of course I listened to the Beastie Boys</p>
<p>growing up, who didn&rsquo;t, I was a child of the 90s.</p>
<p>And they were in this, you know,</p>
<p>Sabotage was sort of an outgrowth of a skateboarding movie,</p>
<p>like Spike Jones and like the girl movies.</p>
<p>And those worlds, the Beastie Boys and skateboarding</p>
<p>were really closely interwoven for a while.</p>
<p>Some people know this, some people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And Spike sort of formed the bridge.</p>
<p>And then Spike went off and started making bigger movies</p>
<p>that more people watch.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s just use them as an example.</p>
<p>I heard you say once before that, you know,</p>
<p>you guys were kind of joking around like Beastie Boys,</p>
<p>like, you know, these guys doing hip hop,</p>
<p>but it was kind of like the hardcore scene in New York,</p>
<p>punk rock scene.</p>
<p>And it was sort of a joke.</p>
<p>There were a lot of inside jokes.</p>
<p>When you were working together,</p>
<p>was there the thought that people might love it,</p>
<p>might hate it, or you just weren&rsquo;t paying attention at all?</p>
<p>Weren&rsquo;t paying attention at all.</p>
<p>Never considered it.</p>
<p>There were no, at that point in time,</p>
<p>when we were making Licensed to Ill,</p>
<p>hip hop music was a tiny underground thing.</p>
<p>And there was no one making hip hop at that time</p>
<p>thought it would ever mean anything.</p>
<p>It was not a realistic thought.</p>
<p>So we were making it really for our crazy friends.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>So do you think nowadays the fact that one can create</p>
<p>something and quote, unquote, release it quickly,</p>
<p>I can put something out onto Twitter or Instagram now,</p>
<p>you can do it in 10 seconds from now,</p>
<p>and I will get immediate feedback that,</p>
<p>which is external feedback, of course,</p>
<p>but then I can iterate on the basis of that feedback.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s problematic</p>
<p>for the larger opportunity for creativity?</p>
<p>In other words, if we were to go back 20 years</p>
<p>or even 15 years, when the opportunity to create</p>
<p>was certainly still there,</p>
<p>but you really didn&rsquo;t know how it was gonna land</p>
<p>until you quote, unquote, released it.</p>
<p>It seems to me there was more opportunity</p>
<p>to stay in that magical rainforest</p>
<p>that is the creativity itself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s wrong or right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s more information that you can use</p>
<p>or not use and use it in a useful way.</p>
<p>And you can make something and put it out</p>
<p>and people could not like it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, oh, they still don&rsquo;t get it here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna, I gotta go harder.</p>
<p>I gotta go harder in that direction, not,</p>
<p>do you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like not to react away from information.</p>
<p>It can be helpful.</p>
<p>It can be helpful when there could be different stories</p>
<p>that happen at the same time where you&rsquo;re making something</p>
<p>and you have an idea of what it is</p>
<p>and then other people engage with it</p>
<p>and they have a different idea of what it is</p>
<p>and they like it for a different reason than you did</p>
<p>or dislike it for a reason different</p>
<p>than the reason you like it.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t control any of those things.</p>
<p>The only part of it that we can control</p>
<p>is how we relate to the thing that we make.</p>
<p>And any external information that undermines the clarity</p>
<p>of that connection is probably bad for the art is my guess.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m only saying this from my experience.</p>
<p>Like I try to make things, all I&rsquo;ve ever tried to make</p>
<p>were something I like or something that I felt like</p>
<p>was missing as a fan that I wanted</p>
<p>and nobody was making it, so I&rsquo;ll make it,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t, it was always in the service of,</p>
<p>I love this thing, I want something like this,</p>
<p>no one else is making one,</p>
<p>I have to make one.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s beautiful because the word</p>
<p>that keeps coming to mind is this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like a compulsion.</p>
<p>Like there are other options of ways to be</p>
<p>and to behave and to function and work in life,</p>
<p>but if something&rsquo;s a compulsion,</p>
<p>it yanks us away from those other opportunities</p>
<p>just enough that we have to get back to it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked before about, and you talk in the book,</p>
<p>this notion of the source.</p>
<p>And to me, again, I can&rsquo;t help</p>
<p>but put my neuroscientist lens on this.</p>
<p>I think of the source as not one brain area,</p>
<p>but some function within the brain</p>
<p>where we are in touch with our bodily signals,</p>
<p>like what feels right, what doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>sort of like tasting the two foods, I love that example.</p>
<p>And that it&rsquo;s a playbook that is,</p>
<p>that is far more vast than the short-term adaptive playbook.</p>
<p>Like this is how I&rsquo;m going to get from point A to point B.</p>
<p>And yet when I listen to an album or a song,</p>
<p>I mean, I have to assume that there,</p>
<p>at some point it becomes not strategy development</p>
<p>or creativity, but strategy implementation.</p>
<p>Like there needs to be,</p>
<p>like the songs are going to come in this order.</p>
<p>And like, I don&rsquo;t know much about music.</p>
<p>My musician friends are always, you know, laughing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t either, it&rsquo;s not so much about music.</p>
<p>Right, well put.</p>
<p>But the ordering of the sequence of the melodies, et cetera.</p>
<p>So at what point does one decide,</p>
<p>okay, like now&rsquo;s the time to get</p>
<p>into that more narrow focus of effort.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;ve got it, let&rsquo;s run with this.</p>
<p>Because there is a component of the creative process</p>
<p>that involves packaging and finishing.</p>
<p>And is that part less satisfying to you</p>
<p>or is it just all part of the same larger arc?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all part of the same, it&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a good feeling.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s usually a good feeling when something is done.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it&rsquo;s a commitment</p>
<p>because up until the time that you say it&rsquo;s done,</p>
<p>you can keep experimenting and changing it.</p>
<p>You know, if you think,</p>
<p>well, maybe tomorrow I can make it better,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s not finished.</p>
<p>And you keep thinking that for a long time,</p>
<p>you can do that forever and never, never put out anything.</p>
<p>So getting to the point where you&rsquo;re ready to sign off</p>
<p>is a good feeling.</p>
<p>And it allows you,</p>
<p>one of the things I talk about in the book is</p>
<p>because it is a difficult thing to do,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s fun to play and it&rsquo;s fun to,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s not the best it could be yet, you know?</p>
<p>To use whatever the next project is gonna be</p>
<p>as motivation to finish the one you&rsquo;re working on now.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m working on this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m spending all of my time on this thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>I believe it can be better,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s this other thing that I really wanna make.</p>
<p>And if I keep tinkering with this one,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never get to make the other one.</p>
<p>So using other projects as a impetus to finish something</p>
<p>and release it into the world&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p>And you said your description of source</p>
<p>is something within us.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I would accurate,</p>
<p>if I would say that was accurate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely in us too,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not only in us.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I think of source as the organizing principle of everything.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s how everything exists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how the trees grow and why there are mountains</p>
<p>and anything that we can see in the outside world</p>
<p>and every discovery and every piece of art</p>
<p>and every new design and every machine</p>
<p>are all outgrowths of this source energy.</p>
<p>Our part of it is the antenna that like connects to it.</p>
<p>And maybe where the vehicle for source</p>
<p>to allow things to happen in the world.</p>
<p>And thank you for that.</p>
<p>Cause I did indeed miss speak</p>
<p>because I recall very distinctly in the book,</p>
<p>you described how the physical world is constrained</p>
<p>by the laws of physics and certain things.</p>
<p>The imagination is unconstrained.</p>
<p>And I think I have this right.</p>
<p>That you said the work sits somewhere between those.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s neither of one nor the other,</p>
<p>that ultimately what feeds into all of that,</p>
<p>our imagination and the way indeed</p>
<p>that our brain is a physical entity,</p>
<p>the nature and the outside world provides</p>
<p>at least what appears to be near infinite,</p>
<p>if not infinite options.</p>
<p>And I love the example of the color palette</p>
<p>that if we restrict me to whatever sorts of paints</p>
<p>or medium I have, then it&rsquo;s restricted.</p>
<p>But in nature, there&rsquo;s an infinite number</p>
<p>of shades and tones and combinations.</p>
<p>And even on one, if you pick up a rock</p>
<p>and look at the color of the rock</p>
<p>and tried to find a paint to match that rock,</p>
<p>it would never match.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s too much, there are too many variations in nature</p>
<p>within a single color rock for us to get close.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s too much information.</p>
<p>We scratch the surface.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re only scratching the surface.</p>
<p>And we love when we are able to peer in</p>
<p>at different scales, spatial scales,</p>
<p>time scales too, but spatial scales,</p>
<p>the delight that comes from that.</p>
<p>You know, like these nature pictures,</p>
<p>seem like there were more of these in the eighties,</p>
<p>like where you&rsquo;d see a drop of oil shot</p>
<p>at high, very high resolution.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s beauty in a drop of oil.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;d see the earth and the galaxy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s beauty in that too, right?</p>
<p>These extremes.</p>
<p>And of course our daily perception is mostly</p>
<p>through the filter of these kinds of interactions,</p>
<p>walls and sometimes outdoors.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a brilliant neuroscientists</p>
<p>and not surprisingly, he has a Nobel.</p>
<p>His name is Richard Axel.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s at Columbia University.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s outrageous personality.</p>
<p>Choose Nicorette nonstop.</p>
<p>You guys would get along great,</p>
<p>not because of the Nicorette,</p>
<p>but because his perspective on things</p>
<p>is very abstract for a guy who&rsquo;s solved,</p>
<p>he won the Nobel for solving a great problem</p>
<p>within how we smell, perception of odors and taste.</p>
<p>And he says, you know,</p>
<p>everything that the brain does is an abstraction.</p>
<p>Like I could take a photograph of your face</p>
<p>and show it to you and say, yeah, that&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>Or let&rsquo;s say for the moment,</p>
<p>I call myself an abstract artist.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just play a game.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;ve never been accused of being an artist,</p>
<p>but, and I do three dots and a squiggly line.</p>
<p>And I say, that&rsquo;s you.</p>
<p>And you say, well, that doesn&rsquo;t look like me.</p>
<p>And I say, but that&rsquo;s my abstraction of you.</p>
<p>Okay, well, the brain essentially does that</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re something in between that</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no actual photograph of you in my brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a bunch of neurons playing</p>
<p>what we call an ensemble,</p>
<p>like a different keys on a piano.</p>
<p>And we go, Rick, I recognize you, Rick Rubin.</p>
<p>And so everything is an abstraction.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only once we start tinkering with the parts,</p>
<p>and this is the essence of science</p>
<p>to remove and add and manipulate.</p>
<p>And the best example I can come up with</p>
<p>would be Rothko.</p>
<p>And I only come up with this example</p>
<p>cause I started off in vision science</p>
<p>and maybe so make the most sense to everyone,</p>
<p>except the folks who&rsquo;ve been blind since birth</p>
<p>and they can swap something in here.</p>
<p>That if I show you a Rothko</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t tell you it&rsquo;s a Rothko,</p>
<p>you may or may not actually think it&rsquo;s that impressive.</p>
<p>It depends on your taste in art.</p>
<p>But what Rothko did, which was amazing,</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t like Rothko&rsquo;s, and I happen to,</p>
<p>is that he removed all the white</p>
<p>and high contrasty stuff.</p>
<p>And when you do that, you alter color space.</p>
<p>And so the colors look very different.</p>
<p>Some people saw that dress a few years ago.</p>
<p>Is it orange or is it gold or whatever?</p>
<p>That was a little bit of the same phenomenon.</p>
<p>I doubt, in fact, I&rsquo;d be willing to bet my left arm</p>
<p>that Rothko knew nothing about</p>
<p>the neuroscience of color perception,</p>
<p>but somehow got to this place</p>
<p>where if there was no canvas showing and no high contrast</p>
<p>and the paintings were large enough</p>
<p>and on the appropriate wall,</p>
<p>you saw them a certain way</p>
<p>that tapped into something fundamental.</p>
<p>And this is where I think art and science really converge</p>
<p>is that every once in a while we see something</p>
<p>that feels amazing to enough people</p>
<p>and not just like the baggy pants phenomenon,</p>
<p>not just because other people think it&rsquo;s cool,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something there.</p>
<p>And again, this defies language.</p>
<p>And I have to imagine that in your years of life</p>
<p>and music and other creative endeavors</p>
<p>that every once in a while,</p>
<p>have you ever encountered something</p>
<p>where like something fundamental</p>
<p>keeps showing up in different form</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s something almost like a rule or a principle?</p>
<p>Does it ever come about?</p>
<p>Because in science, we think of this as like,</p>
<p>this reveals something about our limitation</p>
<p>to abstract the world.</p>
<p>I hope I made that clear.</p>
<p>Not exactly, but I have a thought.</p>
<p>You talked earlier about the drop of oil,</p>
<p>the photograph of the drop of oil and the photograph,</p>
<p>or we could use the, on the other side,</p>
<p>like Hubble telescope images of these vast things</p>
<p>and high definition.</p>
<p>What we see every day is as impressive as those things,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re numb to them because we see them all the time.</p>
<p>We look at drops of oil every day in a microscope.</p>
<p>A month from now, we would not find wonder in that image.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, sometimes it&rsquo;s the novelty</p>
<p>of not seeing it from that perspective before.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really thrilling.</p>
<p>You could, and I could imagine,</p>
<p>and this probably relates to the Rothko idea,</p>
<p>you could see something from a particular angle</p>
<p>and have this magical experience</p>
<p>and then walk three feet to the side</p>
<p>and see it from a different way and it just evaporates.</p>
<p>It only works, it only triggers this thing in us</p>
<p>when we look at it just the right way.</p>
<p>There was a paint, an experiment I just heard about,</p>
<p>heard about the other day that sounds fascinating,</p>
<p>that a painting teacher recommended</p>
<p>where instead of painting, you know,</p>
<p>having a model in the room and painting the model,</p>
<p>that you have the model in the next room</p>
<p>and you go into the next room without your equipment,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have your equipment</p>
<p>and you can study the model for as long as you want</p>
<p>and then you go into a different room</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t see the model and paint the model.</p>
<p>Instead of, and it changes your relationship</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s not, we&rsquo;re not just painting the lines.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re painting what is interesting enough</p>
<p>about what I saw.</p>
<p>What are the data points that stuck in my mind?</p>
<p>And when I string those together, what do I get?</p>
<p>And what do I, how do I form it</p>
<p>to get as close to whatever that,</p>
<p>the experience of that person was,</p>
<p>which the closest of getting to the experience</p>
<p>of that person in the painting</p>
<p>might not look like a photograph.</p>
<p>You know, it might look more different</p>
<p>than more the same to really see what you see.</p>
<p>This, if we think about the Picasso paintings</p>
<p>that were inspired by African art,</p>
<p>where the eyes are on different levels,</p>
<p>they may give us more information</p>
<p>than a photograph would give us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about the,</p>
<p>when you were describing the sensation</p>
<p>of when something takes your breath away</p>
<p>and we all have that</p>
<p>when we see a dramatic sunset.</p>
<p>Anyone you know, when there&rsquo;s a really dramatic sunset,</p>
<p>or if there&rsquo;s a whale,</p>
<p>and if anyone&rsquo;s on the beach and there&rsquo;s a whale,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s really interested that there&rsquo;s a whale.</p>
<p>Do you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>These feelings of wonder,</p>
<p>we get to experience them depending on where we are,</p>
<p>or, you know, a dragonfly,</p>
<p>or a bird flies into your space.</p>
<p>These things happen.</p>
<p>And when they happen,</p>
<p>and when they happen,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re confronted with the mystery of the world</p>
<p>when we change the perspective.</p>
<p>Normally, we don&rsquo;t think of whales in our backyard</p>
<p>or birds in our house, you know, flying freely.</p>
<p>But they do happen.</p>
<p>These things do happen.</p>
<p>And they like break us out of our trance</p>
<p>when these things happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh yeah, there are birds like this everywhere.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not paying attention.</p>
<p>This guy&rsquo;s coming in to like tap me on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Like, remember me?</p>
<p>Here I am, you know?</p>
<p>So I would say that the whale example</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;re describing is it&rsquo;s revealing to us</p>
<p>how, in a delightful way,</p>
<p>how deficient our perceptual filters normally are.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit like the Rothko is revealing how,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never thought about it this way until this moment,</p>
<p>is revealing to us how color normally looks</p>
<p>is actually, first of all, not the only way it looks.</p>
<p>Those colors we think are one way, but all color,</p>
<p>this gets into the biology of color vision,</p>
<p>is all about contrast.</p>
<p>What something is next to dictates what it looks like.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the origin of that dress meme</p>
<p>or whatever you call it.</p>
<p>I still can&rsquo;t figure out exactly what a meme is.</p>
<p>Someone will eventually tell me.</p>
<p>In the same way, when you see a whale and it&rsquo;s delightful,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s revealing to us the extent</p>
<p>to which those whales are, the ocean is vast.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole universe there</p>
<p>and we are blind to it all the time.</p>
<p>And I think the misperception or the misconception,</p>
<p>excuse me, is that we&rsquo;re delighted because we see the whale.</p>
<p>We might be just as delighted</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re getting hit with the contrast</p>
<p>of how little we recognize all the time.</p>
<p>And in that way, it reminds me a little bit about comedy,</p>
<p>where, and I&rsquo;ve been watching more comedy lately,</p>
<p>and sometimes it&rsquo;s the shock.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s the absolute truth that&rsquo;s revealed.</p>
<p>And then other times, what I&rsquo;ve noticed,</p>
<p>and I saw Rogan do comedy at the Vulcan Club in Austin,</p>
<p>which he does every once in a while,</p>
<p>and it was a small club and he was leading out the story</p>
<p>during his routine or bit, I think, right?</p>
<p>This bit, and everyone knew where it was going.</p>
<p>We all knew.</p>
<p>And then when he finally told us,</p>
<p>it was exactly where we thought it was going</p>
<p>and it was hilarious.</p>
<p>And it felt good.</p>
<p>And it felt amazing.</p>
<p>And I thought in that moment, I was like, wait a second,</p>
<p>how did he pull that off?</p>
<p>That was masterful because normally it&rsquo;s this thing</p>
<p>like you create one story,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a scripting out almost like a courtroom lawyer,</p>
<p>and then they kind of pull the curtain</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s something different.</p>
<p>And if you look at the science, the neuroscience</p>
<p>and brain imaging of laughter and humor,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve looked into, to be honest,</p>
<p>and no disrespect to the people in that field,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty lame.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s lame because it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>the jarring nature of a surprise.</p>
<p>But what he led us to was something that,</p>
<p>oh no, he&rsquo;s actually going there.</p>
<p>Oh wait, he&rsquo;s really going there.</p>
<p>And it was this anticipation</p>
<p>with a beautiful delivery at the end.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m convinced that based on</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re talking about here,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something about when we see something,</p>
<p>we think it&rsquo;s about that,</p>
<p>but that the delight that we feel</p>
<p>could be about all the other experiences</p>
<p>that now become in a subconscious way,</p>
<p>kind of like, ha, it&rsquo;s almost like laughing</p>
<p>at this perceptual deficit that we have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like laughing at how little we actually know,</p>
<p>which is what you&rsquo;ve said.</p>
<p>Yeah, it could be that.</p>
<p>It also could be the sense of community</p>
<p>of when you think it&rsquo;s going to go a particular way</p>
<p>and it goes that way, it&rsquo;s like reinforcement of you.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like, yeah, he&rsquo;s saying it,</p>
<p>but in a way we&rsquo;re saying it together.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m listening, he&rsquo;s saying it,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re in this together and that&rsquo;s a good feeling.</p>
<p>To think about that for a second,</p>
<p>I was trying to think about why certain music</p>
<p>still can evoke such powerful emotions in me.</p>
<p>And there does seem to be something special</p>
<p>about the music we listen to when we are teenagers,</p>
<p>from about 14 until about 25,</p>
<p>it seems to get routed into our nervous system in some way,</p>
<p>maybe because that phase of our life</p>
<p>is really one of identity crisis.</p>
<p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t find too many 40-year-olds,</p>
<p>some who are wondering like who they are occasionally,</p>
<p>but almost every young teenager or preteen</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of like, who am I?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re defining personality.</p>
<p>So I always likened it to that,</p>
<p>but leaving out the sort of critical period biology stuff,</p>
<p>what do you think it is about</p>
<p>the music that we hear at that time?</p>
<p>Are we that much more emotionally tuned?</p>
<p>Have we not shut down our sensors quite as much?</p>
<p>Is there, the songs and the artists don&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re very individual to me.</p>
<p>For other people, it will be the Beatles or something.</p>
<p>Now I just really wish the Beatles did it for me too,</p>
<p>but do you think that&rsquo;s important?</p>
<p>Because I could see how it&rsquo;s really terrific.</p>
<p>I could also see how it sets up one of these,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;ll just use nerdy language</p>
<p>and call it like a semi-deprived filter,</p>
<p>because if I&rsquo;m only looking for the way that</p>
<p>like a stiff little fingers track made me feel</p>
<p>the first time I listened to when I was 15,</p>
<p>the feeling is worthwhile.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;m looking for that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m missing all the other stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m missing the Beatles.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m missing Fleetwood Mac,</p>
<p>which never did it for me either.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m missing all this stuff that,</p>
<p>people I love and respect really love.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve never worried about it</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s kind of an infinite treasure trove</p>
<p>of other things that I do love.</p>
<p>But I do sometimes wonder whether or not</p>
<p>my life experiences diminish</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not allowing kind of range.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve obviously worked in a huge number</p>
<p>of different genres of music.</p>
<p>Punk is one thing, hip hop isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, Neil Diamond too, right?</p>
<p>Eminem too, Slayer too, right?</p>
<p>And in some senses I list these off.</p>
<p>I mean, just think about how much in high school,</p>
<p>maybe nowadays less so,</p>
<p>but even in college and as an adult,</p>
<p>societally we&rsquo;re sort of asked to constrain ourselves</p>
<p>to one of these groups.</p>
<p>Like, I didn&rsquo;t know it was okay to love Bob Dylan</p>
<p>and love punk rock as much as I do</p>
<p>until I heard Tim Armstrong said he loved Bob Dylan.</p>
<p>And I was like,</p>
<p>and recently he told me he loves the Grateful Dead.</p>
<p>And I was like, whoa.</p>
<p>But to it, I remember when you had to pick.</p>
<p>Both the Ramones and the Clash loved the Beatles,</p>
<p>so we can-</p>
<p>Okay, I got work to do.</p>
<p>No, but we&rsquo;ll do it together.</p>
<p>Okay, so-</p>
<p>I have a feeling part of it is,</p>
<p>the reason it gets in at that age is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s at a time when we&rsquo;re defining who we are</p>
<p>and the music is part of the definition</p>
<p>of how we see ourselves.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like the music that we hear before that</p>
<p>might be the music that&rsquo;s on the radio</p>
<p>or our parents&rsquo; music</p>
<p>or our older brother or sister&rsquo;s music.</p>
<p>And then when you&rsquo;re 14 or 15</p>
<p>and you start choosing what you&rsquo;re listening to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, now it&rsquo;s finally mine.</p>
<p>And my parents might not like it</p>
<p>and my older brothers and sisters may or may not like it,</p>
<p>but this one is mine.</p>
<p>And it always has that impression in us</p>
<p>that this is ours.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my thought of why it continues to last.</p>
<p>How do you wipe the slate clean then?</p>
<p>So for instance, if you&rsquo;re going to go in</p>
<p>and work with somebody new,</p>
<p>and again, as people are hearing this,</p>
<p>I hope that they&rsquo;re transplanting this</p>
<p>to whatever it is that they do.</p>
<p>Because in the realm of science and podcasting,</p>
<p>communication, it&rsquo;s not music,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a contour and a way,</p>
<p>hopefully this podcast will look nothing</p>
<p>like it does in five years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my hope,</p>
<p>is it will still have the core features</p>
<p>of the beauty and utility of biology coming through,</p>
<p>but I hope it doesn&rsquo;t look anything like episode two.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;ll evolve as you evolve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the truer it is to what interests you.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re not interested in biology</p>
<p>in the same way in five years,</p>
<p>I would hope it&rsquo;s not the same.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be doing psychoanalysis in real time here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do therapy, we&rsquo;ll all be lying down on couches.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, whatever it is.</p>
<p>Yeah, we probably won&rsquo;t be on psychedelics,</p>
<p>but we might be levitating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a brief break</p>
<p>and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker.</p>
<p>InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform</p>
<p>that analyzes data from your blood and DNA</p>
<p>to help you better understand your body</p>
<p>and help you reach your health goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been a believer in getting regular blood work done</p>
<p>for the simple reason that many of the factors</p>
<p>that impact your immediate and long-term health</p>
<p>can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.</p>
<p>The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,</p>
<p>however, is that you get data back</p>
<p>about metabolic factors, lipids and hormones and so forth,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know what to do with those data.</p>
<p>InsideTracker solves that problem</p>
<p>and makes it very easy for you to understand</p>
<p>what sorts of nutritional, behavioral,</p>
<p>maybe even supplementation-based interventions</p>
<p>you might want to take on</p>
<p>in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors,</p>
<p>hormones, lipids, and other things</p>
<p>that impact your immediate and long-term health</p>
<p>to bring those numbers into the ranges</p>
<p>that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you.</p>

<p>So how do you, let&rsquo;s talk a little bit, if you would,</p>
<p>because I know I&rsquo;m very interested in your process, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll spare you the daily routine question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very cliche,</p>
<p>but you and I are both lovers of sunlight, of horizons,</p>
<p>and not as a trivial source,</p>
<p>as an amazing gift of energy, right?</p>
<p>And there aren&rsquo;t words for it, really.</p>
<p>Aside from your daily routines,</p>
<p>when it comes to somebody,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going from project to project,</p>
<p>and you know you&rsquo;re going to be doing work with somebody,</p>
<p>could be your own work,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about the writing of this book</p>
<p>and its structure, which is very unique.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never encountered a book</p>
<p>with this kind of structure before.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the most facile read ever,</p>
<p>and yet every single page I underline,</p>
<p>took notes, starred,</p>
<p>and as you&rsquo;d notice, it&rsquo;s very worn,</p>
<p>very, very worn already,</p>
<p>and only more so over time.</p>
<p>Do you have a process for removing the functions of the day,</p>
<p>and what you were doing last week,</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>and in order to get more access to this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to think of it now more</p>
<p>as a receiver inside of you, right?</p>
<p>Almost like tuning a radio,</p>
<p>and then it comes in,</p>
<p>like the beginning of like a strummer clash, right?</p>
<p>You love the radio, Joe loved the radio, right?</p>
<p>And then it comes in clear, and there it is.</p>
<p>How do you clear the static?</p>
<p>What are some of the operational steps</p>
<p>that you think might be more generalizable</p>
<p>to regardless of where somebody in Africa</p>
<p>is listening to this now?</p>
<p>I would say when I engage in a particular project,</p>
<p>whatever it is,</p>
<p>I dedicate all of myself for that period of time,</p>
<p>whatever it is,</p>
<p>whether it be 20 minutes,</p>
<p>or whether it be five hours,</p>
<p>whatever it is,</p>
<p>total focus,</p>
<p>and no outside distraction whatsoever.</p>
<p>And when I leave that process,</p>
<p>I do my best not to think about it when I&rsquo;m away from it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t bring any materials with me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t leave the studio with works in progress</p>
<p>and spend time listening to them during the day</p>
<p>or looking for ideas.</p>
<p>I stay as far away from it</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m not directly engaging in it as possible.</p>
<p>And in the best of situations,</p>
<p>I have something else to totally engage myself in,</p>
<p>in between.</p>
<p>So instead of working on project A for five hours,</p>
<p>and then leaving and doing nothing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to engage in a project B or B, C, and D</p>
<p>with all of myself before going back to project A again,</p>
<p>which might be the next day, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>So this relates to an amazing chapter</p>
<p>and series of writings of your book</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not going to describe</p>
<p>because I want people to find it for themselves</p>
<p>about disengaging,</p>
<p>about disengaging from the process.</p>
<p>One question I had as I read that chapter,</p>
<p>and as you&rsquo;re saying this now is,</p>
<p>even though you&rsquo;re disengaged,</p>
<p>do you believe that your subconscious</p>
<p>is working it through?</p>
<p>I believe so.</p>
<p>I believe so.</p>
<p>And I think in general,</p>
<p>to stew over a problem is not the way to solve a problem.</p>
<p>Think to hold the problem slightly.</p>
<p>And when I say a problem,</p>
<p>you know, when we&rsquo;re starting a project,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s usually this feeling of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a question mark</p>
<p>at the beginning of every project.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always anxious when I start a new project</p>
<p>because I have no idea what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>I never know.</p>
<p>I never, I never,</p>
<p>I may have in some cases a potential backup plan</p>
<p>if, you know, if nothing works.</p>
<p>But I really try not even to have that.</p>
<p>I prefer not to have that.</p>
<p>I prefer to go in,</p>
<p>maybe to calm myself down enough to be able to show up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be an idea of like, nothing works.</p>
<p>Maybe we could try something like this.</p>
<p>But that would only be for my own anxiety.</p>
<p>That would, it wouldn&rsquo;t be for actual practical use.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s always a sense of anxiety</p>
<p>because I know whatever&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>is completely out of my control.</p>
<p>Something&rsquo;s going to,</p>
<p>something either interesting or not will appear.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re going to follow that wherever it goes.</p>
<p>And until something appears for us to follow,</p>
<p>I have a lot of anxiety.</p>
<p>Even though it has never not come,</p>
<p>you know, it has come every time,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something about it.</p>
<p>Cause I also feel like there might be expectation on me</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m going to make it happen.</p>
<p>And I know that&rsquo;s not happening.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how it works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I show up ready for it to happen</p>
<p>and am open to whatever we have to do</p>
<p>to find that first thread.</p>
<p>And once we find the thread, then it&rsquo;s like, okay,</p>
<p>we have a, and that thread may lead us to anything,</p>
<p>you know, could lead us to in a million</p>
<p>different directions,</p>
<p>but something about having that glimmer</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not a blank,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not looking at a blank page.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re looking at a blank page.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re looking at, okay,</p>
<p>we have the beginnings of,</p>
<p>I would say a map,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a map that we don&rsquo;t know where it takes us.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just the beginning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, it&rsquo;s just the start, you know,</p>
<p>you are here.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t, if you have a map and it says you are here,</p>
<p>even if you can&rsquo;t see the directions,</p>
<p>knowing where we are feels okay.</p>
<p>And once we get, and usually, again,</p>
<p>usually in the first day, first couple of days,</p>
<p>it happens,</p>
<p>but up until then,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really an anxiety producing situation.</p>
<p>And then I can&rsquo;t remember the original question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that was the beginning of,</p>
<p>of something completely different.</p>
<p>But I, do you remember what you asked?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, we were talking about,</p>
<p>and then we were talking about, you know,</p>
<p>so I love this.</p>
<p>So like, what are,</p>
<p>what is your process of wading into this thing?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re revealing that now.</p>
<p>I mean, I, I think of anxiety as readiness, you know,</p>
<p>I mean, think about the characteristic features of anxiety.</p>
<p>It tends to be a bit of a constriction of the visual field</p>
<p>into more of a narrow vision,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s appropriate because you want to shed the,</p>
<p>you know, the, the, the, the, the,</p>
<p>the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s appropriate because you want to shed the,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on elsewhere.</p>
<p>And then, you know,</p>
<p>even when people talk about the shakes or this,</p>
<p>like not feeling okay, sitting still,</p>
<p>anxiety was designed to mobilize us</p>
<p>and not always to run away.</p>
<p>This is one of the, I could, you know,</p>
<p>rarely do I talk about the work in my own laboratory,</p>
<p>but one of the things that frankly I didn&rsquo;t discover,</p>
<p>but it was done in my laboratory,</p>
<p>but this brilliant graduate student,</p>
<p>Lindsay Salay, who&rsquo;s now at Caltech,</p>
<p>was that we can often observe animals or humans</p>
<p>in very high states of anxiety</p>
<p>as they move forward toward a goal.</p>
<p>And we always think of moving forward</p>
<p>as like this calm thing, you know, we, these heroes,</p>
<p>you know, Rosa Parks telling people like,</p>
<p>F you, like, I&rsquo;m not getting off the back,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not leaving the, giving up my seat on the bus,</p>
<p>or Muhammad Ali, I bet you,</p>
<p>they were experiencing tremendous anxiety,</p>
<p>but it was in the forward tilt.</p>
<p>And so I think anxiety is least comfortable</p>
<p>when we are forcing ourselves to stand still.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an activating energy.</p>
<p>And, you know, that brings up a word that, you know,</p>
<p>I have written in my notebook as an extraction</p>
<p>of a lot of themes from within the book</p>
<p>that you and I have talked about before,</p>
<p>which is, and here I&rsquo;m going to sound very West Coast woo,</p>
<p>but I mean it as seriously as it can be stated</p>
<p>that I feel like everything is energetic, right?</p>
<p>We can do things from a place of anger.</p>
<p>We can do things from a place of joy.</p>
<p>We can do things from a place of delight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, I like to think maturing into the idea</p>
<p>that joy and delight and love</p>
<p>is kind of the ultimate reservoir of energy.</p>
<p>But, you know, a lot of the music that I liked</p>
<p>from when I was younger,</p>
<p>it was because of the anger that was thread into it</p>
<p>or the sadness.</p>
<p>If you think of your relationship to that music,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a relationship of love.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t listen to that to get angry.</p>
<p>You listened to it because you loved it.</p>
<p>And I felt loved by it</p>
<p>because it matched where I was at at the time.</p>
<p>It was true to who you were and where you were.</p>
<p>I know that collaboration,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a wonderful chapter on collaboration,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s collaboration, as you mentioned before,</p>
<p>with the universe, not with others.</p>
<p>But in terms of the,</p>
<p>especially the kind of work that you&rsquo;ve done and do,</p>
<p>when it comes to working with artists,</p>
<p>I do wonder,</p>
<p>and here I&rsquo;m not looking for any gossip or stories.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been interested in gossip.</p>
<p>I love stories, but I&rsquo;m not interested in gossip.</p>
<p>But once you see that thread kind of dangling there</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to,</p>
<p>you guys are going to go after this</p>
<p>or you grab onto it and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>okay, now you have a little bit of a map</p>
<p>and an orientation within that map.</p>
<p>I often wonder, you know, scientists are complicated people.</p>
<p>People think they&rsquo;re very boring,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re actually very complicated</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re often living in one limited rule set</p>
<p>of the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you get good at getting degrees</p>
<p>is by understanding the rules of academia</p>
<p>and playing by those rules.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>People tinker with the rules.</p>
<p>You get your Richard Axels who are very playful</p>
<p>in how they go about it, but they are systematic.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s known for rigor, rigor, rigor, right?</p>
<p>When I think of creative artists and musical artists,</p>
<p>I think of a bit more zany or loose,</p>
<p>or you watch the documentary about the Ramones</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, wow, there&rsquo;s all this chaos.</p>
<p>How, because so many of the brilliant artists,</p>
<p>musical artists that are out there</p>
<p>seem to have some chaos inside them</p>
<p>or their lives aren&rsquo;t always structured.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, and science too, by the way,</p>
<p>there are substance abuse issues and personal life issues.</p>
<p>How, since you don&rsquo;t have 100% control,</p>
<p>they need to play the instruments, sing, et cetera.</p>
<p>How do you work with people who have it in them,</p>
<p>but are getting in their own way, right?</p>
<p>And do you think that that kind of the internal chaos</p>
<p>that a lot of artists seem to have,</p>
<p>do you think that sometimes is actually an essential piece</p>
<p>of the creativity picture, that you can&rsquo;t disentangle it?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s an essential piece in general,</p>
<p>but certain artists, that&rsquo;s how they do it.</p>
<p>I would say I rarely get to see the chaotic part of artists</p>
<p>for whatever reason, they rarely show it to me.</p>
<p>And most of them, like most comedians I know,</p>
<p>are much more serious about what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>than what it looks like from, if you see them on stage.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s much more to it and there&rsquo;s much more focus</p>
<p>on craft going on and digging deep</p>
<p>than would necessarily be obvious</p>
<p>seeing them jump around on stage.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of boxing, track and field and boxing,</p>
<p>the sports nobody really cares about</p>
<p>now that UFC is so popular.</p>
<p>And track and field, it&rsquo;s a little bit like wrestling.</p>
<p>When you go, the people that there are there</p>
<p>because they really love it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about wrestling a little bit,</p>
<p>professional wrestling.</p>
<p>But Floyd Mayweather is obviously a colorful character</p>
<p>and one of the best records in boxing of all time.</p>
<p>And a few years back, I got into watching his stuff</p>
<p>and what one sees is the cars and the money,</p>
<p>they literally call themselves the money team,</p>
<p>and the spending and there&rsquo;s all the outrageous stuff.</p>
<p>But I know someone who is in camp with him</p>
<p>who actually was a sparring partner for him</p>
<p>and the lore has it, they have very closed door sparring</p>
<p>or camps, but the lore is that he would do,</p>
<p>because nowadays it&rsquo;s 12, three minute rounds, right?</p>
<p>With a minute in between, used to be 15,</p>
<p>but now neuroscientists stepped in</p>
<p>and it turns out a lot of deaths were occurring</p>
<p>when it was more than 12 rounds.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, you cut off at 12,</p>
<p>really seemed to truncate the death.</p>
<p>There are other things too.</p>
<p>If the dad is apparently a corner man,</p>
<p>we have someone else here at the podcast</p>
<p>who knows more about this than me,</p>
<p>but yeah, the kid not wanting to disappoint the parent</p>
<p>correlated with death.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, and I&rsquo;ll get some of this wrong</p>
<p>and then they can come after me.</p>
<p>But in any case, this guy who was in Floyd&rsquo;s camp</p>
<p>said that he would do 30 to 60 minutes of sparring,</p>
<p>bringing in fresh sparring partners with no rest.</p>
<p>That he would run three or four times per 24 hour cycle,</p>
<p>despite all the critical need for sleep.</p>
<p>That his training was unbelievably intense</p>
<p>to the point where he would just chew out,</p>
<p>chew up and destroy all training partners.</p>
<p>And yet the perception that we see</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s kind of a, it&rsquo;s playful for him.</p>
<p>So it sounds very similar.</p>
<p>Like what we see is often not what goes into it,</p>
<p>that people are intensely rigorous.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think in a way from a psychological perspective,</p>
<p>if you knew you were fighting someone</p>
<p>who wasn&rsquo;t taking it seriously,</p>
<p>that would give you some confidence</p>
<p>and that would not be a good thing</p>
<p>if the person was actually working really hard</p>
<p>outworking you, do you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s from a psychological perspective</p>
<p>that makes sense to me.</p>
<p>So I keep coming back to is that I&rsquo;m imagining in my mind</p>
<p>kind of two ends of the continuum.</p>
<p>One that is about fairly narrow focus,</p>
<p>training, training, strategy, implementation,</p>
<p>cultivating craft, building craft.</p>
<p>And then the other side is this, the cloud.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very nebulous, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this word that I learned from a colleague of mine</p>
<p>when I was down at the Salk Institute</p>
<p>when my lab was there, because he studies this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this phenomenon that I don&rsquo;t want to mispronounce</p>
<p>because then it sounds like something else.</p>
<p>But the correct pronunciation is pareidolia.</p>
<p>And pareidolia is our tendency to look at an amorphous shape</p>
<p>like a cloud or a tree</p>
<p>and think that it looks like something else.</p>
<p>An ice cream cone.</p>
<p>The man in the moon.</p>
<p>And that again, reveals the extent to which the brain</p>
<p>wants to place symbolic filters on things.</p>
<p>And we need this, right?</p>
<p>Because I see you walk in the door and,</p>
<p>Rick, I recognize you.</p>
<p>In fact, we have a brain area</p>
<p>called the fusiform face gyrus.</p>
<p>It literally is a face recognition area.</p>
<p>And you could be at any orientation</p>
<p>or I could just see your eyes and know that it&rsquo;s you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a phenomenon called propriocegnosia</p>
<p>where people can see faces,</p>
<p>they can describe everything in the face,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t know, for instance,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s JFK or Madonna or Lex Friedman.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite the list.</p>
<p>Quite the list.</p>
<p>There you go, Lex.</p>
<p>Run for office, Lex.</p>
<p>Just kidding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard enough to get you to respond to my text as it is.</p>
<p>So we have these filters.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re taking this cloud</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re deciding what things are.</p>
<p>And what I want to drill into your process</p>
<p>a little bit more deeply,</p>
<p>when you approach a project,</p>
<p>so everyone meets each other, shakes hands,</p>
<p>here are the engineers,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to sit down,</p>
<p>everyone knows what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>because you work with professionals,</p>
<p>and you start going,</p>
<p>are you trying to be with the cloud</p>
<p>or in the implementation?</p>
<p>Like, where are you in that continuum?</p>
<p>And forgive me if I&rsquo;m trying to surgically</p>
<p>go into your process in a way</p>
<p>that would disrupt it in any way,</p>
<p>but I trust you&rsquo;ve been doing this for a while</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no threat of that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the cloud with the exception of,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware of what could go wrong on a technical side.</p>
<p>And I might, like, if something good is happening,</p>
<p>I might look over and make sure that we&rsquo;re rolling.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a leap over to here momentarily,</p>
<p>but then you&rsquo;re back in the cloud.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>If I feel like,</p>
<p>if I was in the moment,</p>
<p>I would be in the cloud,</p>
<p>and if something good starts happening,</p>
<p>it would trigger something in me,</p>
<p>like, uh-oh, I hope this is,</p>
<p>I hope we&rsquo;re really doing this</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know if we could ever do this again.</p>
<p>That would be a thought of when the first time</p>
<p>the real world would come into the picture</p>
<p>would be something good is happening.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not lose it.</p>
<p>And when that happens, do you,</p>
<p>never been in a studio besides a podcast studio,</p>
<p>do you say, hey guys, that sounded good,</p>
<p>more of that, or do you wait, you let them continue?</p>
<p>Because obviously you don&rsquo;t want to break their flow.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d never want to break any flow once it&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Yeah, once something&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>just kind of sit back and watch.</p>
<p>And do you think there&rsquo;s resonance,</p>
<p>like the team of engineers and other people know</p>
<p>when it quote unquote is happening?</p>
<p>If everyone&rsquo;s paying attention, yes.</p>
<p>When everyone&rsquo;s paying attention,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s usually pretty obvious.</p>
<p>Sometimes the threat will be something different</p>
<p>than expected, and maybe not everybody would pick up on it.</p>
<p>And that might be a particular,</p>
<p>that might be particular based on my taste</p>
<p>or an artist&rsquo;s taste,</p>
<p>or someone involved might say that was,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s listen back to that.</p>
<p>I think that was better than what we thought</p>
<p>that can happen.</p>
<p>You said several things and it was like,</p>
<p>you said enough for there to be several conversations.</p>
<p>I tend to do that, sorry, especially with you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get to see you as nearly as often as I would like.</p>
<p>And so when I do,</p>
<p>I confess that I&rsquo;m a little bit of a kid in a candy shop.</p>
<p>I wrote down the brain tells us stories.</p>
<p>So you talked about, I walk in certain data points,</p>
<p>you recognize me,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a real like looking at a cloud shorthand.</p>
<p>We go through our lives doing this all day</p>
<p>with everything we see.</p>
<p>And the shorthand, in the case of me, you know me,</p>
<p>the shorthand turns out to be right, it checks out.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s something we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and something we&rsquo;re not familiar with,</p>
<p>something happens, we experience something on the street,</p>
<p>something happens and it doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>Something out of the ordinary happens.</p>
<p>First thing is, is this doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>Then what we do is again, subconscious, unconsciously,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s unconscious or subconsciously</p>
<p>without thinking, we create a story</p>
<p>that explains what just happened, a hypothetical</p>
<p>that makes it okay that what just happened, happened.</p>
<p>And, oh, maybe he&rsquo;s running</p>
<p>because his dog ran away and he&rsquo;s chasing his dog.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s running.</p>
<p>And as soon as we have that thought of what it might be,</p>
<p>we relax because now it&rsquo;s not just a guy running</p>
<p>and this is weird, but it&rsquo;s a guy running.</p>
<p>Oh, he&rsquo;s probably running after his dog.</p>
<p>And now we register that story</p>
<p>that we just made up without even knowing</p>
<p>we were making it up as what happened.</p>
<p>And then later in the day, if someone says,</p>
<p>yeah, do you see that guy running out of the box?</p>
<p>Like, yeah, he was chasing his dog, I saw that.</p>
<p>And you won&rsquo;t even realize</p>
<p>that it was the maybe hypothetical story</p>
<p>that was the first possible explanation</p>
<p>that allowed you to continue walking.</p>
<p>Do you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our whole lives.</p>
<p>Our whole lives are reacting to things,</p>
<p>making up a story of what we think may have happened</p>
<p>without realizing that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>and then living the rest of our lives</p>
<p>as if that thing that we made up really happened</p>
<p>and we never know.</p>
<p>I completely agree.</p>
<p>We confabulate from birth until death.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this well-observed phenomenon</p>
<p>in people who have memory deficits.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the sad example of this,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the everyday typical,</p>
<p>not, who knows, sad or not sad example.</p>
<p>So for instance, if somebody has a slight memory deficit</p>
<p>or someone has Alzheimer&rsquo;s dementia,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll find themselves in the hallway at night</p>
<p>and say, what are you doing here?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll say, oh, you know,</p>
<p>I was going to get a glass of water,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re walking away from the direction</p>
<p>that would make sense.</p>
<p>People who, alcoholics who drink enough</p>
<p>develop something called Korsakoff syndrome</p>
<p>where a certain brain area gets messed up</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll ask them a question like,</p>
<p>oh, what are you doing here?</p>
<p>And they will come up with incredible stories,</p>
<p>sometimes interesting stories</p>
<p>that have no bearing on reality.</p>
<p>You ask them who their name is.</p>
<p>But do they believe, they believe that&rsquo;s what happened.</p>
<p>With 100% certainty.</p>
<p>And this actually relates to a lot of the</p>
<p>now better understood controversy around repressed memories.</p>
<p>You know, you can, especially from young people,</p>
<p>you can pull memories from them</p>
<p>of things that never happened.</p>
<p>This has been demonstrated over and over again.</p>
<p>So courtrooms know to be very cautious now</p>
<p>about this whole notion of repressed memories.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good to know.</p>
<p>Yeah, very, very complicated area of the law,</p>
<p>as you can imagine,</p>
<p>because we want, we tend to want to trust victims</p>
<p>for understandable reasons.</p>
<p>But in terms of accuracy of details,</p>
<p>two people have very different accounts of the same,</p>
<p>of the same experiences.</p>
<p>And this has been shown over and over again.</p>
<p>And even that you can do well in the laboratory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty interesting.</p>
<p>So again, because of these selective filtering</p>
<p>and storytelling, and we are,</p>
<p>I think it was Salman Rushdie who said,</p>
<p>we are the storytelling species.</p>
<p>He probably-</p>
<p>Wow, I was going to say we&rsquo;re storytelling machines.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think, you know, we are the story.</p>
<p>I would say that the big five,</p>
<p>if I had to pick up sort of brain function is,</p>
<p>we are very limited filters.</p>
<p>The mantis shrimp sees 67 shades of red</p>
<p>for every one that we see.</p>
<p>So they have access to things we don&rsquo;t have access to.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not, as far as I know, you know,</p>
<p>releasing albums of the, you know,</p>
<p>red hot chili peppers caliber, but who knows,</p>
<p>maybe down there they are.</p>
<p>I did see something, by the way,</p>
<p>as a relevant tangent recently.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s, look,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s crazy, it&rsquo;s super cool.</p>
<p>If you take a device that amplifies</p>
<p>the electrical signals coming from cactus,</p>
<p>and you just translate that into a simple rule</p>
<p>of conversion to two or three pitches of sound,</p>
<p>the music that comes out of it is beautiful.</p>
<p>Nothing short of beautiful.</p>
<p>And when I saw that, the teenager in me thought,</p>
<p>you know, when we hear whale song,</p>
<p>we think it&rsquo;s so beautiful.</p>
<p>Like, what if they&rsquo;re just like cursing at each other</p>
<p>the whole time, right?</p>
<p>I mean, maybe they&rsquo;re in there like a Rogan episode</p>
<p>when he invites all his comedian friends in there.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a psychoanalytic conversation</p>
<p>about their childhood traumas.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But we decide whale song is beautiful.</p>
<p>We decide cactus are just plants.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s beautiful to us.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re right that it is beautiful to us,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t mean we know anything about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we have these filters, perceptual filters.</p>
<p>We only can see and hear, smell and taste what we can.</p>
<p>And then the brain likes to work in symbols.</p>
<p>We tend to like to match that person</p>
<p>whose shoes are messed up must be homeless.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a couple instances in life</p>
<p>where I saw what I thought was a homeless vagrant</p>
<p>inside a building at an academics institution.</p>
<p>It turned out it was the most accomplished person</p>
<p>in the field.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always cool.</p>
<p>Yes, that happened at Berkeley.</p>
<p>Then the other thing that we do</p>
<p>is we tend to put symbol,</p>
<p>so we said perception, symbol representations,</p>
<p>and then our memories are entirely confabulated</p>
<p>based on already deficient symbol</p>
<p>and perceptual representation.</p>
<p>And so I never liked the statement</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t know how the brain works.</p>
<p>I think we do know how the brain works,</p>
<p>but that it works through very limited filters.</p>
<p>Knowing that and accepting it.</p>
<p>It seems to me that this idea of looking to nature,</p>
<p>looking outside us is so critical.</p>
<p>And in fact, I hope you won&rsquo;t mind me sharing this,</p>
<p>but a few years back, I had sent you something by text</p>
<p>and I was kind of in disbelief</p>
<p>about something I&rsquo;d seen in the media.</p>
<p>I was like, they got it all wrong.</p>
<p>And I knew the person involved</p>
<p>and it was not a good situation for them.</p>
<p>I was like, they got it all wrong.</p>
<p>And you wrote back and you said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all lies, back to nature, the only truth.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s wild.</p>
<p>And I wrote that down, I put it over my desk.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And I still, I&rsquo;d tattoo it on my forehead</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t already have it well committed to memory.</p>
<p>But I think I know that&rsquo;s true, right?</p>
<p>Nature we can look at and it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>But when I say it&rsquo;s all lies,</p>
<p>you just talked about our ability to,</p>
<p>how limited our facility to see and understand what we see.</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So based on that, that leads us to,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t know much.</p>
<p>Do you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Our resolution is so low on everything</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re really just like, we&rsquo;re grasping at straws.</p>
<p>We have no idea.</p>
<p>We have no idea.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s great power in knowing that.</p>
<p>Because if you think you know what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>chances are you&rsquo;re being deceived.</p>
<p>Not because somebody is deceiving you,</p>
<p>but because they&rsquo;re telling you what they see</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all, do you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all made up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all made up.</p>
<p>Everything that we, everything we know is made up.</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>This brings us to pro wrestling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the reason that pro wrestling is closer to reality</p>
<p>than anything else we can watch or any other content.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, we know it&rsquo;s made up.</p>
<p>We know that it&rsquo;s a performance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s storytelling.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how everything is,</p>
<p>except we think wrestling&rsquo;s fake and the world is real.</p>
<p>Wrestling&rsquo;s real and the world&rsquo;s fake.</p>
<p>You talk about in the book,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re definitely going this direction.</p>
<p>In the book, you talk about this notion</p>
<p>of entertaining the idea of the opposite being true, as it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s our not only emerging,</p>
<p>but established fields of psychology</p>
<p>that are making great ground, I think,</p>
<p>into the human psyche, Byron Katie&rsquo;s work and others,</p>
<p>where you take a statement</p>
<p>and you start playing with that statement</p>
<p>for you poke at its authenticity.</p>
<p>And when I first heard that, I thought,</p>
<p>this is kind of hokey, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just words.</p>
<p>And then I realized how foolish I was being</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s really onto something.</p>
<p>And there are others too, of course,</p>
<p>but in science, that&rsquo;s exactly what you do.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really ask questions in science.</p>
<p>You are forced to raise hypotheses</p>
<p>and try and say true or false.</p>
<p>Now, there are limitations to that approach, certainly.</p>
<p>I mean, pure observational studies have been incredible</p>
<p>in terms of what they&rsquo;ve revealed to us,</p>
<p>especially in medicine.</p>
<p>A patient that has a bullet hole</p>
<p>through a certain area of the brain,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t go in and say,</p>
<p>oh, I hypothesize that person will have a deficit</p>
<p>in seeing faces.</p>
<p>No, the person wandered into the clinic</p>
<p>and they go, this person sees faces,</p>
<p>but can&rsquo;t make sense of them.</p>
<p>And then you reverse,</p>
<p>you forensically arrive at an understanding.</p>
<p>But in general, we go about things in this way.</p>
<p>And considering that the opposite might be true,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s a little bit, I suppose,</p>
<p>of like seeing the whale at the surface of the water.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, the opposite of my experience,</p>
<p>which is all above water for the most part,</p>
<p>is maybe not the complete experience of life.</p>
<p>You start seeing the inverse all the time.</p>
<p>So I want to-</p>
<p>Consider the inverse all the time.</p>
<p>And it really relates to the way that you described</p>
<p>how we see colors is based on contrast.</p>
<p>So maybe blue&rsquo;s only blue in relation to yellow.</p>
<p>So if blue is our choice,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re not considering yellow,</p>
<p>blue doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Do you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we talk about night.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only night because there&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>If there was no day, there is no night.</p>
<p>In all of our cases,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the yin-yang.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the light and the shadow always.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always another side for everything.</p>
<p>And we focus on one aspect.</p>
<p>But if we look at the other aspect,</p>
<p>chances are we&rsquo;ll learn something too.</p>
<p>The nervous system is not just able to do this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the way it does everything.</p>
<p>Two experiments I&rsquo;ll just briefly describe.</p>
<p>My scientific great-grandparents,</p>
<p>David Hubel and Torrance de Wiesel,</p>
<p>showed that if you force a person</p>
<p>to look at something for a long period of time</p>
<p>without moving their eyes,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a way that you can do this,</p>
<p>the image disappears.</p>
<p>Because normally your eyes are making little micro saccades</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re comparing what you&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s right next to it, pixel by pixel,</p>
<p>pixel by pixel, pixel by pixel.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t even have to use the example</p>
<p>of pressing on the arm,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re sitting in chairs right now.</p>
<p>And until I said,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on at the level of sensation</p>
<p>on the backs of your thighs,</p>
<p>you were unaware of it</p>
<p>because if you experience a pressure</p>
<p>or a smell in a room,</p>
<p>you ever walk in,</p>
<p>the smell is either good or not good,</p>
<p>pretty soon the smell disappears.</p>
<p>The neurons are still firing like sledgehammers on a bell,</p>
<p>but we become blind and deaf to it</p>
<p>because the nervous system likes to habituate</p>
<p>the value of that signal when it&rsquo;s there often.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only the stuff that comes through,</p>
<p>signal the noise,</p>
<p>that kind of jolts us into attention and awareness.</p>
<p>And I want to return to attention awareness,</p>
<p>which are prominent themes in the book.</p>
<p>And I think in an important way,</p>
<p>not just, oh, attention awareness is important,</p>
<p>but you also give insight into how to pay better attention,</p>
<p>how to pay awareness with the understanding</p>
<p>that people are going to go about it differently.</p>
<p>But I do want to ask you about wrestling</p>
<p>because when I was growing up,</p>
<p>I was not, I lived South of the Cow Palace</p>
<p>and there was some wrestling going on there.</p>
<p>I think back then it was WWF.</p>
<p>And there was a short stint in my childhood</p>
<p>where I paid attention to, in particular,</p>
<p>was it Coco Beware, the guy that had a macaw?</p>
<p>I was obsessed with tropical birds.</p>
<p>And he would come in,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d put his tropical bird on the thing.</p>
<p>And then who&rsquo;s that, George the Animal Steel,</p>
<p>the guy that would eat the ring.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so, and-</p>
<p>I believe he was a professor.</p>
<p>Seriously, seriously, seriously.</p>
<p>Was he really?</p>
<p>In real life.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>He was a professor,</p>
<p>George the Animal Steel as a wrestler.</p>
<p>And I loved the movie, The Wrestler.</p>
<p>The Wrestler.</p>
<p>Darren Aronofsky movie.</p>
<p>It was Mickey Rourke.</p>
<p>Yeah, one of the reasons I liked it</p>
<p>is I once visited Ashbury Park.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that where that was filmed?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a vacant, he goes to visit his daughter.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a vacant amusement park</p>
<p>or abandoned amusement park scene there</p>
<p>that was really eerie.</p>
<p>Still kind of haunts me a little bit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about the East Coast</p>
<p>in kind of fall,</p>
<p>all the places that people normally go</p>
<p>just for the summer</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t have out here on the West Coast.</p>
<p>People on the East Coast are just tougher than we are.</p>
<p>It still haunts me.</p>
<p>Great movie.</p>
<p>But I remember watching wrestling</p>
<p>and it was at that age,</p>
<p>I think I was probably about 12, 13,</p>
<p>maybe 11, 12, 13,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re kind of entering puberty.</p>
<p>So, and puberty is a fundamental landmark of development.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most rapid period of aging.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also when we start to change our rule set,</p>
<p>like certain people in certain kinds of interactions</p>
<p>take on profoundly different meaning, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a reproductive competence time</p>
<p>and when kids change, their bodies change.</p>
<p>The rule book changes fundamentally.</p>
<p>Our understanding of the world changes in that moment.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the moment that a child understands</p>
<p>really what sex is and kind of how they got there</p>
<p>and that a lot of the stuff that we see in the world</p>
<p>is kind of passively or not so passively</p>
<p>being sent through that filter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s something,</p>
<p>it changes the rule or the rule book of perception.</p>
<p>I view this age from about 11 to 13,</p>
<p>at least for me was a unique transition point</p>
<p>where the gap between what I perceived as reality</p>
<p>and fiction was kind of blurry.</p>
<p>This is captured pretty well in that movie,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Stand By Me,&rdquo;</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re hanging around the campfire at night</p>
<p>and the kid says,</p>
<p>who do you think would win in a fight</p>
<p>between Superman and Mighty Mouse?</p>
<p>And the other kid says like, you idiot,</p>
<p>Mighty Mouse is a cartoon.</p>
<p>Of course Superman would win.</p>
<p>And like, to me, that&rsquo;s being 11 and a half or 12 years old</p>
<p>where your understanding of reality as you know it</p>
<p>is changing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not completely crystallized</p>
<p>into an adult form reality.</p>
<p>That sounds like a really healthy place to be to me,</p>
<p>like that, not letting it crystallize.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the, there&rsquo;s where the downfall happens.</p>
<p>So I have questions specifically about wrestling,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really about process.</p>
<p>I want to know whether or not you watch wrestling</p>
<p>because it allows you to access the energy state</p>
<p>in your body and mind,</p>
<p>and that kind of mode of thinking in which reality</p>
<p>as one conceives it is somewhat blurry,</p>
<p>or is it for a number of other reasons, which is fine?</p>
<p>Is that the energy you&rsquo;re trying to export</p>
<p>and bring to the creative process elsewhere to life?</p>
<p>Is it that anything is possible</p>
<p>or that we&rsquo;re dealing with archetypes?</p>
<p>Because it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s Coco Beware</p>
<p>or Randy Macho Man Savage,</p>
<p>or George the Animal Steel and the lovely Elizabeth.</p>
<p>I guess I did watch a little bit of wrestling.</p>
<p>They are archetypes,</p>
<p>much like the Greek myths or the Bible,</p>
<p>or no disrespect to the Bible or to Greek myths</p>
<p>or to wrestling for that matter.</p>
<p>Archetypes are a powerful filter for humans,</p>
<p>but we know that they&rsquo;re a very limited filter too</p>
<p>because people aren&rsquo;t built like square wave functions.</p>
<p>We have curves and contours and complexity.</p>
<p>So what is the deal with your relationship to wrestling?</p>
<p>I think it maintains that kind of playfulness.</p>
<p>Anything is possible.</p>
<p>We expect the unexpected all the time in wrestling,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a way to have a kind of a feeling</p>
<p>of the energy of a sport with no competition.</p>
<p>Everyone is working together</p>
<p>to put on the best show they can.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more like a ballet than it is like a sporting event.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s great skill involved.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the few things that I can watch</p>
<p>and really feel relaxed.</p>
<p>It relaxes me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like I have to think about it.</p>
<p>I can just relax and enjoy it.</p>
<p>This brings up a topic that is very near and dear</p>
<p>to my heart, which is this notion of balance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very near and dear to my heart,</p>
<p>which is this notion of dopamine schedules.</p>
<p>I never want to reduce everything to dopamine,</p>
<p>but dopamine is the universal currency</p>
<p>of delight, pleasure, motivation seeking.</p>
<p>There are other chemicals involved too,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a beautiful experiment</p>
<p>and a couple of examples that I&rsquo;ll use as a foundation</p>
<p>to more questions about wrestling and why it&rsquo;s powerful</p>
<p>and why other people may want to use wrestling</p>
<p>or some other endeavor as a way to access</p>
<p>creative energy and source.</p>
<p>Earlier, we talked about, you can train an animal</p>
<p>to press a lever three times and then get reward</p>
<p>and it will learn three&rsquo;s the magic number for reward.</p>
<p>And then it can switch.</p>
<p>It takes a little bit of training and then they can switch,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t do prime numbers.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t do high abstraction schedules.</p>
<p>Humans either, we&rsquo;re not very good at figuring out</p>
<p>the rule set for optimal foraging.</p>
<p>We do it well enough to persist as a species,</p>
<p>at least for now, but it&rsquo;s very likely</p>
<p>that we are not tapping into that system</p>
<p>as well as we could.</p>
<p>And how would we know if we don&rsquo;t know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those, you don&rsquo;t know what you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a beautiful experiment that explored</p>
<p>when dopamine is released in the context of watching sport</p>
<p>or watching comedy, believe it or not.</p>
<p>And with the comedy stuff,</p>
<p>it was every time there was a surprise,</p>
<p>it was kind of that jarringly, ha ha,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d measure people&rsquo;s dopamine output.</p>
<p>They were also brain imaging.</p>
<p>In a game of basketball,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a beautiful opportunity experimentally</p>
<p>because every time one team gets the ball</p>
<p>or shooting free throws or something,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going down court and it&rsquo;s either going to end up</p>
<p>in the basket or it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Might end up on the free throw line, but it&rsquo;s never not.</p>
<p>So what they found is that the schedule of anticipation</p>
<p>was every time there was a switch of which team got it.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re waiting, waiting, and then it&rsquo;s, ah,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re waiting, waiting, yes, waiting, waiting,</p>
<p>three pointer, oh, awesome.</p>
<p>And if something happened where it looked like</p>
<p>they were going to make the three pointer,</p>
<p>but then somebody basically swatted the ball away</p>
<p>and then went for a half court shot,</p>
<p>like you don&rsquo;t expect that very often,</p>
<p>bigger dopamine release, okay?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of how the dopamine thing works.</p>
<p>When you describe wrestling, I wonder,</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t know the script,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not one team gets it, then the other team gets it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s going to win.</p>
<p>Anything could happen is what you said.</p>
<p>The availability of that dopamine surge or drip,</p>
<p>which is a powerful thing,</p>
<p>is completely, it&rsquo;s completely out of your reach</p>
<p>in terms of anticipation.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know when it&rsquo;s going to come,</p>
<p>but it must arrive often enough that you return to it</p>
<p>11 hours a week of watching.</p>
<p>In many ways, the way I&rsquo;m starting to conceptualize</p>
<p>the creative process is a little bit the same.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know where those nuggets of gold</p>
<p>and those loose threads are,</p>
<p>but you have enough experience.</p>
<p>And in this case, I am referring to you specifically</p>
<p>to know that they are in there.</p>
<p>The people walking in this room</p>
<p>have a certain level of ability and talent to create</p>
<p>that the map will form itself</p>
<p>as we are going through the voyage.</p>
<p>And those nuggets of, here I&rsquo;m calling them dopamine,</p>
<p>but they are out there.</p>
<p>And that knowledge is enough to get you to come back again.</p>
<p>And again, to trust the process.</p>
<p>So I actually think the way you described wrestling as,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s the energy of the sport.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the, whether or not it&rsquo;s this move or that move</p>
<p>or who wins or who loses, it&rsquo;s the energy.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s the energy that it creates in you</p>
<p>as an observer.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s the energy it creates in me</p>
<p>and the reality that it&rsquo;s honest in what it is</p>
<p>in a world where seemingly nothing is honest at what it is.</p>
<p>And again, not because people are lying all the time.</p>
<p>We have little data.</p>
<p>We make up a story to explain it.</p>
<p>And then we say, that&rsquo;s what happened.</p>
<p>And we have trusted sources</p>
<p>who do exactly what I just described</p>
<p>and who pass this down as gospel of what we think</p>
<p>and what we teach and maybe it&rsquo;s true and maybe it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>With wrestling, we know maybe it&rsquo;s true, maybe it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>We lean towards it not being true.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s really interesting about wrestling</p>
<p>and maybe one of the most fun things about it</p>
<p>is that sometimes real life works its way into the story.</p>
<p>Like two wrestlers get married.</p>
<p>Now-</p>
<p>In real life.</p>
<p>Well, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You never know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like in the storyline, they&rsquo;re getting married</p>
<p>or getting divorced or best friends turn on each other.</p>
<p>And it could be part of the story</p>
<p>and it could really be happening because they do, right?</p>
<p>Someone breaks their leg.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re out because their leg is broken.</p>
<p>Did they break their leg?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re out.</p>
<p>Do you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re told they broke their leg.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s always this like, I wonder what&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I wonder where the line is.</p>
<p>We know that it&rsquo;s scripted or predetermined.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how they say it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s predetermined.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t know where reality is and isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And in some ways, that&rsquo;s our real experience of the world.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really know where reality is and isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We have an idea maybe.</p>
<p>I think in some ways, wrestling is more honest</p>
<p>or legitimate because we start with the idea</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s fixed.</p>
<p>When we go to a boxing match,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t go to a boxing match thinking it&rsquo;s fixed.</p>
<p>Yet it might be.</p>
<p>And historically, it&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>Or there was just something in baseball where,</p>
<p>was it baseball?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t follow baseball.</p>
<p>I should know.</p>
<p>There was just a big sports,</p>
<p>one of the teams that-</p>
<p>The plays, basically.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Was it the call signals of the catcher?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not supposed to deprogram</p>
<p>or deconstruct the call signals of the other team.</p>
<p>And I guess maybe a team got caught doing that.</p>
<p>Yes, and the team that won whatever the World Series was.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like with wrestling, that wouldn&rsquo;t be a scandal.</p>
<p>Do you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like-</p>
<p>Because almost anything goes.</p>
<p>Anything goes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the world is really like.</p>
<p>So in some ways, it&rsquo;s comforting.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s still this mystery of like,</p>
<p>well, I wonder if that&rsquo;s true or not</p>
<p>because we never really know.</p>
<p>Someone gets hurt.</p>
<p>Did they really break their back</p>
<p>or are they just going on vacation?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll never know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>It is fascinating.</p>
<p>And I feel like there are certain people</p>
<p>who show up in a way that is surprising</p>
<p>in not just one direction, but in all directions.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s one thing for a celebrity to come out</p>
<p>and make a statement.</p>
<p>That can be interesting or not interesting</p>
<p>depending on the celebrity and the statement</p>
<p>and the delivery.</p>
<p>But, and I&rsquo;m probably going to get this wrong</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m terrible at pop culture things,</p>
<p>most of them anyway.</p>
<p>But as I recall, Lady Gaga showed up to some event</p>
<p>wearing an outfit made of meat.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t tell you for the life of me</p>
<p>whether or not that was a statement against meat</p>
<p>or for meat.</p>
<p>Maybe it was a statement for the carnivore diet.</p>
<p>Maybe it was a statement for veganism.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Either way.</p>
<p>Or maybe neither.</p>
<p>Or maybe neither.</p>
<p>But it was definitely a statement</p>
<p>in that it broke with the norm.</p>
<p>And it said to me, okay,</p>
<p>she creates different rules for herself</p>
<p>or sort of breaks boundaries that other people had.</p>
<p>I never heard of anyone doing that before.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean they hadn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but I never heard of anyone doing it before.</p>
<p>But we do tend to associate outside the current playbook</p>
<p>with quote unquote creativity,</p>
<p>unless it crosses a line,</p>
<p>in which case it becomes something else.</p>
<p>It becomes almost theater for sake of theater.</p>
<p>But what you&rsquo;re telling me is that</p>
<p>within the realm of wrestling,</p>
<p>theater is the goal at some level.</p>
<p>And everybody knows it who goes into those arenas,</p>
<p>who watches it.</p>
<p>Everybody.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And everyone agrees to kind of suspend outside reality</p>
<p>and say, this is reality.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And they boo for the bad guys</p>
<p>and cheer for the good guys,</p>
<p>knowing that backstage they&rsquo;re probably friends.</p>
<p>Except for the kids that are 11,</p>
<p>who think it&rsquo;s really real.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if they know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>The only other person I know</p>
<p>who has vocalized their love of professional wrestling</p>
<p>to the extent that you have</p>
<p>is Lars Fredrickson,</p>
<p>the rhythm guitar player for Rancid,</p>
<p>who loves wrestling.</p>
<p>But his statement,</p>
<p>and forgive me, Lars,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m getting this wrong,</p>
<p>is that because he grew up in an area of the South Bay</p>
<p>where there were no teams,</p>
<p>like now there&rsquo;s the San Jose Earthquakes,</p>
<p>but there was no football team in San Jose.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s from Campbell.</p>
<p>But there were no good teams,</p>
<p>no sports teams,</p>
<p>but they had wrestling.</p>
<p>And he had it where?</p>
<p>On the television set.</p>
<p>And so if you didn&rsquo;t have a,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t grow up with any organized sports thing.</p>
<p>The 49ers were up the road,</p>
<p>but for me it was skateboarding.</p>
<p>And I love it for the same reason.</p>
<p>You actually never really know what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>There is no rule book.</p>
<p>The rule book is made up.</p>
<p>But they are very,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a unique sport in that,</p>
<p>surfing&rsquo;s a bit like this too,</p>
<p>in that they are absolutely maniacal</p>
<p>about making things look a certain way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about just doing it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about doing it and making it look good.</p>
<p>Smooth, catching it with the front foot.</p>
<p>And the trends change.</p>
<p>Style.</p>
<p>Style.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a style.</p>
<p>Style is this nebulous thing of like,</p>
<p>you know, in fashion or in sport.</p>
<p>Whereas with a football,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some amazing catches.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s even like the catch,</p>
<p>which I happen to know is a 49er,</p>
<p>the catch during the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>But in general,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the goal is get in the end zone,</p>
<p>win the game.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure football players are like cringing</p>
<p>as I say this,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you run ugly,</p>
<p>if you run fastest.</p>
<p>In skateboarding, that would never fly.</p>
<p>In fact, you basically be ridiculed out of the sport.</p>
<p>In wrestling, is it the same?</p>
<p>Is there style to wrestling?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all performance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all the charisma of the people involved.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the physical ability,</p>
<p>the ability to talk and tell a story,</p>
<p>and how charismatic the performers are.</p>
<p>Whether you want to watch them,</p>
<p>whether you want to see them win,</p>
<p>whether you want to see them lose,</p>
<p>and whether you&rsquo;re interested in cheering</p>
<p>or booing for them.</p>
<p>I was going to say it reminds me of opera,</p>
<p>but opera get released over and over again.</p>
<p>You know the story and how it ends when you walk in,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve listened to it before.</p>
<p>So wrestling does seem to be unique in that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s real-time iteration,</p>
<p>at least from the perspective of the-</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s real-time iteration based on,</p>
<p>because people get hurt all the time,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing really crazy physical stuff.</p>
<p>So if someone gets hurt, the story has to change,</p>
<p>because in real life, they can&rsquo;t show up next week</p>
<p>and do what was planned in the script.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very alive,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of,</p>
<p>something interesting and unexpected is always happening.</p>
<p>Well, in a much more calm form,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll share with you something,</p>
<p>just like your perspective on it.</p>
<p>For years, I used a tool</p>
<p>in order to try and access ideas,</p>
<p>since I was a little kid, actually,</p>
<p>because I have a little bit of OCD,</p>
<p>a little bit of a Tourette&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>When I get tired, I&rsquo;ll do that,</p>
<p>and very strategy implementation oriented.</p>
<p>When I was a little, little kid,</p>
<p>I needed all my stuffed animals arranged in a certain way.</p>
<p>Legos had to be a little neurotic, or a lot.</p>
<p>And then science is very much about,</p>
<p>you have to do things with a lot of precision.</p>
<p>And I discovered that the ultimate reset for me</p>
<p>when I was in graduate school or a postdoc,</p>
<p>if I couldn&rsquo;t make it to a really good,</p>
<p>like agnostic front show, or like chaos,</p>
<p>like the chaos of a punk rock show for me</p>
<p>was kind of this reset.</p>
<p>It was like, ah, could like release all this thing,</p>
<p>and I got energy from it.</p>
<p>First time I saw Transplants play,</p>
<p>and you know, it was like, whoa,</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>And it was scary, and I loved it.</p>
<p>The other thing that I used over time</p>
<p>to kind of reset this ability to think in a structured way</p>
<p>without it feeling like it was overcoming me,</p>
<p>maybe even access the same thing</p>
<p>in some ways that you&rsquo;re accessing with wrestling</p>
<p>was I like to stare at Aquaria.</p>
<p>Like I like to go to aquariums or I&rsquo;d build aquariums,</p>
<p>and I would just sit there</p>
<p>because you never know which way the fish are going to go.</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s going that way,</p>
<p>but then all of a sudden they&rsquo;ll turn and go the other way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely unpredictable.</p>
<p>And I love Aquaria because of the tranquility</p>
<p>and had them in my lab for a long time.</p>
<p>I just adore aquariums</p>
<p>because of the non-linearity of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not A, B, C, it&rsquo;s A, Z, Z, Q, you know?</p>
<p>And I think this is what some people try</p>
<p>and access through psychedelics,</p>
<p>but that didn&rsquo;t seem to me like a very good way</p>
<p>to do it on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Whereas with Aquaria, you just, the tanks are there.</p>
<p>So in your book, you talk about something</p>
<p>that I also share a love for,</p>
<p>which is how the ocean and aspects of nature,</p>
<p>like clouds and ocean, they have a predictability to them.</p>
<p>We know where they are and where to find them.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the sun rises and sets every day,</p>
<p>at least for now.</p>
<p>And we can count on them with 100% reliability.</p>
<p>And yet they are from the perspective</p>
<p>of like what physicists would say, they&rsquo;re very chaotic.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t look at a wave</p>
<p>and know exactly how the foam is going to roll out.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s going to roll in and roll out.</p>
<p>We have the tides.</p>
<p>But when I hear about wrestling,</p>
<p>when I think about my love of Aquaria,</p>
<p>when I think about my love of punk rock music, for instance,</p>
<p>or I think about the ocean,</p>
<p>I think of it in that way that we actually have a need</p>
<p>to source from things that have both a combination</p>
<p>of structure and no structure.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting that there are some places</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t change and some places that change a lot.</p>
<p>And I can remember thinking about this.</p>
<p>I was walking, there&rsquo;s a beach that I walk on in Hawaii.</p>
<p>That I walk on every morning when I&rsquo;m there.</p>
<p>And if you walk on the same beach every day,</p>
<p>you kind of get a sense of what it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>And I remember I was in Hawaii,</p>
<p>walked on the beach every day for a year,</p>
<p>however long it was.</p>
<p>And then I left for six months and I came back.</p>
<p>And the next time I walked on the beach,</p>
<p>it was an entirely different beach, entirely different.</p>
<p>And I remember thinking in that moment,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, this is an unusual place</p>
<p>because I pictured the house that I didn&rsquo;t even grow up in.</p>
<p>The house I lived in maybe for the first seven years</p>
<p>of my life.</p>
<p>And I think about what the backyard looked like.</p>
<p>And I think about a particular old tree that was there.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know this for sure,</p>
<p>but my sense is if I were to go back to where I grew up</p>
<p>and go to that place and look in that yard,</p>
<p>it would probably look pretty similar.</p>
<p>Yet here was this beach that I was walking on in Hawaii</p>
<p>that in the course of six months,</p>
<p>completely changed its face.</p>
<p>And just how interesting both of those things are.</p>
<p>And that depending on the project we&rsquo;re working on,</p>
<p>to be able to go to a place that we know</p>
<p>has the potential to change a lot</p>
<p>and what that would do to our connection with the earth</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re experiencing that,</p>
<p>versus going to a place that has very little change.</p>
<p>And you can kind of count on it being the way</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always been.</p>
<p>That both of those are interesting things</p>
<p>to be able to draw upon,</p>
<p>depending on what we want to open in our psyche.</p>
<p>I have an almost unhealthy fascination with New York</p>
<p>in the mid 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t live there though.</p>
<p>No, but since I was a kid,</p>
<p>I went there when I was a little kid</p>
<p>and I was fascinated by it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a very interesting migration</p>
<p>of East Coast to West Coast creatives,</p>
<p>including yourself,</p>
<p>that played an important part of my life,</p>
<p>just seeing things and hearing things</p>
<p>that were meaningful to me.</p>
<p>But I like, for instance, I love the movie.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen the documentary,</p>
<p>but the one about Jean-Michel Basquiat,</p>
<p>because of the characters that are in it</p>
<p>and the huge number of people in that,</p>
<p>like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, and Christopher Wall,</p>
<p>and on and on.</p>
<p>Those images of New York at that time</p>
<p>are so exciting and what was happening.</p>
<p>I wish I could transplant myself to that.</p>
<p>If I had a time machine, that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;d land first.</p>
<p>I hear a lot of people say,</p>
<p>New York isn&rsquo;t what it used to be.</p>
<p>San Francisco isn&rsquo;t what it used to be, whatever.</p>
<p>LA isn&rsquo;t what&hellip;</p>
<p>There does seem to be something</p>
<p>that feels a little bit disruptive to people</p>
<p>about cities changing.</p>
<p>But the idea that natural landscapes change</p>
<p>is actually, we even accept like,</p>
<p>if fires sweep through places</p>
<p>and assuming they weren&rsquo;t started by humans,</p>
<p>we accept that, that change</p>
<p>and the reordering of landscapes is normal and healthy.</p>
<p>And I always tell myself,</p>
<p>they have the kids growing up in New York</p>
<p>or San Francisco or Chicago now,</p>
<p>they only know it that way.</p>
<p>So to them, it&rsquo;s as cool or as uncool</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s ever gonna be, right?</p>
<p>They either wanna get out</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re loving every piece of it.</p>
<p>And this happened for all the people that came before us.</p>
<p>So my question is a very basic one.</p>
<p>Do you miss the New York that you came up in?</p>
<p>Are you somebody who is attached to the past?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not attached at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not attached to anything in the past.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t look back at all.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think about like,</p>
<p>oh, in my dorm room at NYU, Beastie Boys, this,</p>
<p>like I miss&hellip;</p>
<p>No, your optics are forward, present and forward.</p>
<p>Only present and forward.</p>
<p>Is there a process to that</p>
<p>or it just happens to be where you default to?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure, but that&rsquo;s how I do it.</p>
<p>Nostalgia is not in Rick Rubin&rsquo;s brain.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh, lucky you, man.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I say that with genuine admiration.</p>
<p>So you can hear a song</p>
<p>that maybe you had a role in producing or not,</p>
<p>something from the past,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re accessing a state presumably,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not pining for or wishing how it was.</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no psychologist,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to venture to say</p>
<p>that I think that&rsquo;s a very unique quality.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people wish for</p>
<p>or wish that things did not happen the way they did,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a lot of living in the past.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of this notion of like people future trip.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the default state of the brain.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people live in emotional anchors</p>
<p>to the past, good and bad.</p>
<p>No, I have none.</p>
<p>And watching wrestling is one way</p>
<p>that you cleanse the palate.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>You go to a meal and they pass around this,</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t really do the same more,</p>
<p>but pass around a little bit of sorbet</p>
<p>to cleanse the palate.</p>
<p>Turns out there&rsquo;s a biological reason for that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of neutralization of the taste receptors</p>
<p>between savory and sweet, et cetera.</p>
<p>So if wrestling is your palate neutralizer.</p>
<p>I know that if I watch wrestling before I go to sleep,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be a good night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>Do you dream about wrestling?</p>
<p>No, never.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just relaxing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just relaxing.</p>
<p>Do you anticipate when you watch it?</p>
<p>Like here comes the dopamine hit.</p>
<p>Sometimes, sometimes when it happens,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>Yeah, sometimes it&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>But do you enjoy it?</p>
<p>But even men, it&rsquo;s like the stakes are low.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t really care what happens,</p>
<p>which feels good.</p>
<p>You know that I&rsquo;m just being entertained.</p>
<p>Do they actually get hurt sometimes?</p>
<p>You said they do.</p>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>Often.</p>
<p>They do.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re basically stuntmen.</p>
<p>So imagine stuntman getting hurt, doing a crazy stunt.</p>
<p>Happens all the time.</p>
<p>Well, in the movie, The Wrestler,</p>
<p>I remember he got staples stapled into him.</p>
<p>And I thought that&rsquo;s pretty intense.</p>
<p>I once went and saw,</p>
<p>I guess they called it Mexican wrestling.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they call it that anymore,</p>
<p>where the guys dip their hands.</p>
<p>Yeah, they dipped their hands in glass.</p>
<p>This was in Sacramento.</p>
<p>And I went and saw it.</p>
<p>I honestly didn&rsquo;t have a stomach for it.</p>
<p>I really didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t believe it was legal.</p>
<p>It might not have been legal.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I thought.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s crazy stuff in wrestling sometimes.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So before sleep,</p>
<p>is that typically when you watch wrestling?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s useful for people to have some activity</p>
<p>that allows them to kind of clear their mind</p>
<p>and create peace before heading off to sleep?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>And I think yoga nidras would be good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like yoga nidra pro wrestling.</p>
<p>Any of the, any of those type things.</p>
<p>Yeah, not watching the Dalmer thing.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t watch that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t watch any horror, anything,</p>
<p>or I don&rsquo;t like violent things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I know it exists.</p>
<p>I know horrible things happen in the world,</p>
<p>but I certainly don&rsquo;t want to do that before sleep.</p>
<p>I think these liminal states before</p>
<p>and emerging from sleep are very powerful.</p>
<p>When you wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>are your thoughts immediately structured</p>
<p>or do you enjoy the kind of clearing of the clouds?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a slow process for me to wake up.</p>
<p>And I like that.</p>
<p>I like not engaging too much too soon.</p>
<p>I also, another, I usually fall asleep</p>
<p>listening to a lecture or something speaking</p>
<p>because if I&rsquo;m, if I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I can get caught in my own thoughts</p>
<p>and listening to something is enough of a focus point</p>
<p>that it stops me from talking to myself.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do the same.</p>
<p>My grandfather listened to the radio,</p>
<p>to sports on the radio, and he would fall asleep.</p>
<p>Oftentimes he was a smoker with a cigarette in his mouth.</p>
<p>His wife&rsquo;s responsibility was to stay up later than he did</p>
<p>to make sure he didn&rsquo;t burn everything down.</p>
<p>And then when you wake up, you said it&rsquo;s a slow process.</p>
<p>Is it an hour or two before you feel like you&rsquo;re?</p>
<p>I would say probably an hour.</p>
<p>I usually wake up and try to get in the sun</p>
<p>as soon as I possibly can</p>
<p>and hope to spend, hope to spend about an hour.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll usually go for a walk on the beach</p>
<p>for another hour, 90 minutes, depending.</p>
<p>Are you with family members and other people at that time?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m usually focused by myself.</p>
<p>Phone?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be listening to something.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t look at the phone, but I listen.</p>
<p>I listen to, again, a lecture or a podcast or audio book.</p>
<p>I like audio books a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do too.</p>
<p>If an idea comes to mind, do you write it down?</p>
<p>I may.</p>
<p>It depends.</p>
<p>I like to.</p>
<p>I usually would do a note in my phone.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t usually carry pen and paper with me</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m walking.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do the same.</p>
<p>I do a long Sunday hike or jog</p>
<p>and I will audio script into my phone.</p>
<p>People sometimes give me funny looks</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m talking to myself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a nice way to do it though.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to learn more of the audio methods of doing it</p>
<p>instead of the typing methods.</p>
<p>Right now I type and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the best way.</p>
<p>The voice memos function in the iPhone</p>
<p>and other phones is really good.</p>
<p>And there are now companies like Rev.com</p>
<p>that will turn those into Word doc scripts</p>
<p>that are fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive.</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re not a sponsor of the podcast.</p>
<p>I just happen to use it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I actually learned that trick from Richard Axel,</p>
<p>the Nicorette chewing wild man, Nobel prize winner.</p>
<p>He writes manuscripts and by walking around his office,</p>
<p>pacing and talking into his phone.</p>
<p>I always think of the Woody Allen movie</p>
<p>where the Alan Alda character is talking about,</p>
<p>yeah, he&rsquo;s speaking comedy ideas into the phone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really pretentious.</p>
<p>I liked that movie about Harvey Milk,</p>
<p>that Sean Penn played Harvey Milk.</p>
<p>Because that all took place before I was alive,</p>
<p>mostly in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s these beautiful scenes of him,</p>
<p>as I recall, sitting there at his kitchen table</p>
<p>talking into a tape recorder at night,</p>
<p>talking about how he predicted</p>
<p>that he would be possibly assassinated, et cetera.</p>
<p>And this goes back to the Strummer thing</p>
<p>about writing things down.</p>
<p>I think that a lot of people, including myself,</p>
<p>feel a little bit of like egotistical guilt</p>
<p>around like, who am I to think that my ideas</p>
<p>could be worthwhile or something?</p>
<p>But I think over time, I&rsquo;ve come to realize</p>
<p>that the ideas about experiments</p>
<p>or health questions I have about health,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t always, but oftentimes can lead to real seeds</p>
<p>that grow into big trees.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s interesting to you.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what anyone else thinks.</p>
<p>Most of my notes are not for anyone else&rsquo;s use.</p>
<p>I hear about something that&rsquo;s interesting to me</p>
<p>and I think about, okay,</p>
<p>I want to learn more about this, whatever it is.</p>
<p>And then sometimes those things work their way</p>
<p>into things I&rsquo;m doing because the universe</p>
<p>seems to work in that way.</p>
<p>But I rarely am learning something</p>
<p>with the idea of using it.</p>
<p>I learn things with the idea of, this is what I want to know.</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s interesting to me.</p>
<p>And then often those things that are interesting to me</p>
<p>can find their way into other projects just because they do.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s almost like Kohler kindling.</p>
<p>But the moment that you think of it that way,</p>
<p>it sort of, it sounds so extractive, right?</p>
<p>But if you, so you take this walk</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re writing down the occasional idea perhaps,</p>
<p>and then what is the next sort of the way that,</p>
<p>here are less than do this, than this, than that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in like, where does your mind shift to?</p>
<p>Does it become more structured as the day goes on?</p>
<p>Does your thinking become more structured</p>
<p>around projects and plans?</p>
<p>I try to deal with things that need dealing with after that</p>
<p>and in preparation for going to work.</p>
<p>And then when I go to work, it&rsquo;s more like free,</p>
<p>this free thing where I&rsquo;m, again,</p>
<p>hoping something good comes, welcoming something good,</p>
<p>paying attention and maybe trying to will it to happen,</p>
<p>but never, but knowing I don&rsquo;t have the ability</p>
<p>to make it happen.</p>
<p>I can just be present for it and be ready if it does arrive.</p>
<p>Some of the more surprising,</p>
<p>and I found really interesting and useful features</p>
<p>of the book were about dancing with structure</p>
<p>and lack of structure.</p>
<p>So when I think of structure, I think of like deadlines.</p>
<p>So when you are in the process of creating something,</p>
<p>obviously deadlines are relevant, time of day, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only so many hours in the day</p>
<p>where one can stay in the groove</p>
<p>or in this like readiness to receive.</p>
<p>Have you ever found yourself in that mode</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re kind of grinding, like, ah, like here we are,</p>
<p>like, okay, I&rsquo;m not coming home for dinner tonight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the next, you know, we&rsquo;re going to push.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, put on the coffee pot kind of thing.</p>
<p>A lot, a lot in the, over the course of my life, a lot,</p>
<p>not as much now.</p>
<p>And one of the things that I discovered</p>
<p>through working on the book was the phases of work</p>
<p>were not required to treat the different phases of work</p>
<p>in the same way.</p>
<p>Whereas before I did,</p>
<p>before everything was in this state of play,</p>
<p>everything had a wide open time schedule.</p>
<p>It happens when it happens.</p>
<p>And if it takes two years or three years,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter, it&rsquo;s not about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only about this thing has to be great.</p>
<p>And what I came to realize in working on the book</p>
<p>is that there are different phases.</p>
<p>And the first phase is this seed collecting phase,</p>
<p>which is kind of an ongoing part of life in general.</p>
<p>I do that.</p>
<p>I do that always, whether I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>whether I&rsquo;m working on something or not,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always in the seed collecting phase</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no deadline or just anything that interests me</p>
<p>that I think I want to learn more about</p>
<p>or has potential to be something, anything,</p>
<p>something, I hear something, I think, hmm,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to read more about that.</p>
<p>Or I wonder if there&rsquo;s a movie about that.</p>
<p>Is there a movie about that?</p>
<p>If not, maybe there&rsquo;s a movie to be made.</p>
<p>You know, like, again, I want,</p>
<p>this is something I want in my life.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if it exists.</p>
<p>If it doesn&rsquo;t exist,</p>
<p>then maybe that&rsquo;s something interesting to pursue.</p>
<p>But I know that the desire is there because I have it.</p>
<p>So in the seed phase, there&rsquo;s no deadlines.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a wide open part.</p>
<p>And then the next phase is called the experimentation phase</p>
<p>where you start experimenting</p>
<p>to see what the seeds want to do.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re involved, but you&rsquo;re more of a,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not really dictating the action.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re setting the stage for something to happen,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not about you yet.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;d be like the equivalent of you&rsquo;d plant the seed,</p>
<p>you would water it,</p>
<p>you would make sure it was in the sun, and you&rsquo;d wait.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re involved, but you can&rsquo;t make it grow, you know?</p>
<p>And then when it sprouts and it grows</p>
<p>and if it turns into a plant,</p>
<p>then you can look at the plants,</p>
<p>like, okay, how does this plant,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the potential of this plant?</p>
<p>And then the third phase is the crafting phase</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, okay, I have this plant,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m gonna trim it,</p>
<p>or maybe I&rsquo;m gonna combine it with these other plants</p>
<p>to make something else with it.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s like material that you have.</p>
<p>And then finally is the completion or finishing phase,</p>
<p>which is the final edit, getting to the version of it.</p>
<p>The version of it that&rsquo;s the one</p>
<p>that you can share with the world</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re gonna do.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve come to realize that by the time</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going into the completion phase,</p>
<p>you can have a deadline and it won&rsquo;t hurt the project.</p>
<p>In fact, it might help the project.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t know that before.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve worked on projects that have gone longer</p>
<p>than they necessarily needed to.</p>
<p>And maybe not in the best interest of the project</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t understand the timing of that</p>
<p>because I am so aware of the necessity</p>
<p>in the experimental phase to not have a deadline</p>
<p>that I assumed that that held through the whole project.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not a clear phase one finishes</p>
<p>and then you start phase two,</p>
<p>phase two finishes and then you start phase three.</p>
<p>You move back and forth between them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m collecting seeds all the time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always in phase one.</p>
<p>And then probably to some degree,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always some version of experimentation going on.</p>
<p>Maybe not now, but if something&rsquo;s on a list of things</p>
<p>I wanna look at, hopefully I&rsquo;ll get to the list</p>
<p>and give them some experimentation</p>
<p>and see what they can turn into.</p>
<p>And then if they do turn into something,</p>
<p>then they get to the crafting phase</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s more, okay, now I have this thing.</p>
<p>What do I know about this kind of thing?</p>
<p>What can I match this with?</p>
<p>What can I use this for?</p>
<p>How can I be involved as a craftsman?</p>
<p>And by the end of the crafting phase</p>
<p>or deep into the crafting phase,</p>
<p>you can start seeing the end.</p>
<p>You can start seeing an end</p>
<p>and then you can even dictate an end.</p>
<p>But I recommend if you do just dictate it for you,</p>
<p>not for anyone else,</p>
<p>because if something comes up where you learn,</p>
<p>if you set a deadline, a public deadline,</p>
<p>and then a new discovery happens along the way</p>
<p>and you realize, oh, this could actually be much better</p>
<p>than I thought, but I need more time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s harder to do that if you set the deadline.</p>
<p>So I would say have an internal deadline</p>
<p>to get to finish it.</p>
<p>That said, if an unusual situation comes up</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s better for everything not to meet that deadline,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of those rules that you set the rule to break it</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s best for the project.</p>
<p>But that was a new thing for me and it helped me a lot.</p>
<p>When did you realize that?</p>
<p>In collecting the material for the book</p>
<p>and thinking about it.</p>
<p>When I realized that it was phases,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know any of this.</p>
<p>When I started writing the book,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know hardly any of the things in the book.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re more, most of it would be reverse engineering</p>
<p>something that I had experienced, a successful experience,</p>
<p>using these methods without knowing they were methods,</p>
<p>just following my instincts, got me to something good.</p>
<p>And then I would look back at why did I want to do that?</p>
<p>And is there a principle at play</p>
<p>that could be of use outside of this case?</p>
<p>And how do I explain that?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the book is,</p>
<p>is these reverse engineered principles</p>
<p>that have led to good decision-making</p>
<p>and trying to make things.</p>
<p>The chapter on self-doubt was really interesting to me.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;re all-</p>
<p>Tell me what it says,</p>
<p>because I can&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll read the first sentence of it,</p>
<p>which is that self-doubt lives in all of us.</p>
<p>And while we may wish it was gone, it is there to serve us.</p>
<p>And it goes on to describe how to dance with self-doubt</p>
<p>in not so many words.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a saying</p>
<p>that is actually from the landscape of psychology,</p>
<p>which is generally discussed</p>
<p>in a kind of pathological context,</p>
<p>which is, if nothing matters, anything goes.</p>
<p>This is usually the phrase used to describe people</p>
<p>who feel as if there&rsquo;s no use in living,</p>
<p>so just go crazy, often to self-destruct.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a light version of this, I realize,</p>
<p>where in some sense,</p>
<p>the creative process seems to have something to do with,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not paying attention to what outcomes are,</p>
<p>like who likes it, who doesn&rsquo;t like it,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just doing it for you,</p>
<p>you make the rule play, I want to delight myself,</p>
<p>well then, anything goes,</p>
<p>and you have an infinite rule set there</p>
<p>to extract from, at least initially.</p>
<p>So, as one gets better at their craft,</p>
<p>you can imagine self-doubt goes down.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the perception of a lot of people, right?</p>
<p>You get better at what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>you can land more free throws as a basketball player,</p>
<p>you can hit more home runs as a baseball player,</p>
<p>you can produce more platinum albums as an artist,</p>
<p>self-confidence goes up, self-doubt goes down,</p>
<p>but I think you and I both know a number of people</p>
<p>who are successful enough to know that,</p>
<p>oftentimes, there&rsquo;s a mirror image to that</p>
<p>where people feel pressure because they did it once,</p>
<p>now they got to do it again.</p>
<p>Yes, or that you think you&rsquo;re so good at it</p>
<p>that it comes easily and you don&rsquo;t have to apply yourself.</p>
<p>Arrogance.</p>
<p>Yeah, so self-doubt, it&rsquo;s like a check on yourself.</p>
<p>It can either be really helpful, or it can undermine you.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s something we all have,</p>
<p>and if we let it undermine us,</p>
<p>then we don&rsquo;t make anything, and that&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>But when used as a balancing tool in our lives,</p>
<p>it serves a great function, where we really do,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s okay to have all the confidence in the world,</p>
<p>and still second guess, is this the best it can be?</p>
<p>You can doubt, I think the phrase is in the book,</p>
<p>you can doubt your way to a great work,</p>
<p>to a masterpiece, but it&rsquo;s okay to doubt your way.</p>
<p>To a great work, to a masterpiece.</p>
<p>Sometimes that questioning allows you to push further</p>
<p>than just accepting I made it so it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve encountered more people</p>
<p>that seem to be driven by self-doubt</p>
<p>and the need to constantly perform and perform again</p>
<p>than I have real arrogance.</p>
<p>Just that&rsquo;s been my experience, fortunately.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve met some arrogant people in my life,</p>
<p>but, and of course, we never, as a psychiatrist,</p>
<p>who I admire a lot, and bioengineer,</p>
<p>who was a guest on this podcast, Karl Deisseroth,</p>
<p>said we never really know how other people feel.</p>
<p>I mean, most of the time, we don&rsquo;t even know how we feel.</p>
<p>Again, language is a very deprived format</p>
<p>for explaining feelings, so we think somebody feels one way,</p>
<p>but we can observe, and it could be another,</p>
<p>but we observe their behavior.</p>
<p>So, in the sense of returning to the work,</p>
<p>just always returning to process,</p>
<p>it sounds like your routine is fairly scripted,</p>
<p>at least now, but the things that you are getting</p>
<p>in touch with, wrestling, sleep and dreaming, the ocean,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a predictability of them</p>
<p>because you can access them in a predictable way,</p>
<p>but they seem to have a lot of unpredictability in them.</p>
<p>The ocean is completely unpredictable.</p>
<p>I also listen to a lot of music that I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>so I listen to a lot of classical music,</p>
<p>less so, but some jazz,</p>
<p>and a lot of old music that I never heard before,</p>
<p>and I like being surprised by music,</p>
<p>and sometimes it really catches me off guard,</p>
<p>like I shazam a lot when I hear something I like.</p>
<p>Have you ever encountered music that really works well live,</p>
<p>but just does not work in a recording?</p>
<p>Or that is that much better live,</p>
<p>but the recording is sort of, meh.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to name names.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I feel like maybe there are some artists who are great live</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve never captured it well on record.</p>
<p>Example would probably be the Grateful Dead&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good example of a band where I feel like their albums</p>
<p>are not their strong point,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re, if you hear live recordings,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really interesting</p>
<p>and really different from each other,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s kind of part of what makes</p>
<p>the Grateful Dead interesting is their unpredictability.</p>
<p>I confess, I had a sister who listened to the Grateful Dead,</p>
<p>and I got taken to a few shows when I was younger,</p>
<p>and they would do that, what is it called, space?</p>
<p>It was like these drum solos</p>
<p>that would go on for hours and hours.</p>
<p>This is like the antithesis of punk rock shows</p>
<p>where songs are like 90 to 120 seconds,</p>
<p>and I remember thinking like, what is this?</p>
<p>But people I know who love the Grateful Dead</p>
<p>love that uncertainty about where that drum thing,</p>
<p>I think they do call it space.</p>
<p>Forgive me, Deadheads, I&rsquo;m not enough of one</p>
<p>to get it right.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re looking for something,</p>
<p>and sometimes they find it,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re there when they find it, it feels exciting,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just following a script.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like something is really happening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real moment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that I aim for in the studio</p>
<p>is to create real moments that when you hear them,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t necessarily sound perfect.</p>
<p>They sound like something that really happened,</p>
<p>and in that moment, something happened,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a special moment.</p>
<p>And you can feel that if they were to play it again,</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t be like that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something really exciting about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really how jazz works as well,</p>
<p>and I think bringing some of that jazz mentality</p>
<p>into other types of music is really interesting,</p>
<p>makes for compelling things,</p>
<p>because when you hear them,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain amount of,</p>
<p>you really have to pay attention to do it.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re doing it, you&rsquo;re really paying attention.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t really know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no music.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no map to follow,</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re working together to make something.</p>
<p>Do I play or not play?</p>
<p>When do I play?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re really paying attention,</p>
<p>can I add, or you go to start adding something,</p>
<p>and someone else added something,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, oh, I can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, everyone&rsquo;s just in this moment,</p>
<p>experiencing this thing at once</p>
<p>that you can feel as a listener,</p>
<p>and we get to hear their excitement of finding it,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s thrilling when it happens.</p>
<p>So I like that experience.</p>
<p>I feel like that&rsquo;s kind of what the dead do live.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll play songs in different ways,</p>
<p>and again, I don&rsquo;t know very much about the dead,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s sort of a newer,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s newer for me to listen to the dead.</p>
<p>Growing up, I never listened to the dead,</p>
<p>but probably because I heard songs on their albums</p>
<p>and thought, this doesn&rsquo;t really speak to me,</p>
<p>but I think that the albums don&rsquo;t really reflect</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s special about them.</p>
<p>I think a lot of their shows were recorded, right,</p>
<p>or videotaped.</p>
<p>But by fans, which they supported.</p>
<p>They supported that everybody come, everybody tape,</p>
<p>everybody trade tapes.</p>
<p>It made sense for who that band was.</p>
<p>They redefined, or they defined, excuse me,</p>
<p>the notion of followers.</p>
<p>I mean, people literally gave up their lives</p>
<p>or spent much of their lives</p>
<p>literally driving from city to city to follow them.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not like going from city to city</p>
<p>to watch a movie over and over,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not a movie.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different every night.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s changing.</p>
<p>Pretty incredible phenomenon.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know of anything else quite like it except cults,</p>
<p>and those often don&rsquo;t end well.</p>
<p>I think a guy that mixed the punch</p>
<p>for the Jonestown Massacre went to my high school.</p>
<p>That was the-</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>I think so, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>My sister is really good at all this kind of like 70s, 80s,</p>
<p>like dark psychology trivia.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a very light person, but-</p>
<p>Did you read Season of the Witch?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about San Francisco in the 60s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll love it.</p>
<p>One-</p>
<p>Great book.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to check it out.</p>
<p>The way you describe experiences going by in time</p>
<p>or things emerging in time</p>
<p>and the creative process being a way</p>
<p>of sort of capturing those moments,</p>
<p>maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera,</p>
<p>I thought was beautifully captured</p>
<p>in the analogy you gave</p>
<p>about a kind of a conveyor belt going by of things, right?</p>
<p>That we think of the creative process</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s going to land in us or we&rsquo;re going to enter it,</p>
<p>or that we&rsquo;re going to sit there in a chair</p>
<p>and like grit our teeth.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s like a some Hemingway quote</p>
<p>where you just sit there and stare at the page</p>
<p>until the beads of blood form on your forehead or something.</p>
<p>Maybe it was him.</p>
<p>Maybe it was, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>it sounds like Bukowski or something.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m going to get this wrong.</p>
<p>People tell me in the comments,</p>
<p>maybe no one said it.</p>
<p>It was a dream.</p>
<p>But I love this conveyor belt thing.</p>
<p>That reminds me of being in laboratory,</p>
<p>doing experiments thinking I was trying to solve one thing</p>
<p>and then seeing something else</p>
<p>and then having to make the decision like,</p>
<p>is that really cool enough to drop everything</p>
<p>and go that direction</p>
<p>or to kind of spend a night or a week</p>
<p>or a career going that way?</p>
<p>I mean, these are kind of big decisions</p>
<p>given that at least as far as we know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to live 100 years or less.</p>
<p>But this idea that we have, you know,</p>
<p>thoughts and experiences in our past</p>
<p>and we can draw on and like try and make good decisions.</p>
<p>Do we like grab these things off the conveyor or not?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hearing you and I&rsquo;m starting to realize</p>
<p>that being attached to the past</p>
<p>might be the worst thing that one could do</p>
<p>in terms of being able to make good decisions</p>
<p>in this context.</p>
<p>Because if we have a kind of a playbook</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s worked and what hasn&rsquo;t worked,</p>
<p>but you actually talk about this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a passage in the book, you know,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll just read it.</p>
<p>To be aware of the assumption</p>
<p>that the way you work is the best way</p>
<p>simply because it&rsquo;s the way you&rsquo;ve done it before.</p>
<p>I sat with this page for almost 10 full minutes,</p>
<p>which is not something I do very often.</p>
<p>Maybe you could elaborate on this a little bit.</p>
<p>I mean, we want to have, you know,</p>
<p>mechanisms and routines we can trust.</p>
<p>But this is, I think, an important warning.</p>
<p>Yeah, when something works,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to be fooled into believing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the way to do it or that&rsquo;s the right way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a way and it&rsquo;s just a way</p>
<p>that happened to work that time.</p>
<p>And this plays into when you get</p>
<p>advice from people who have more experience than you.</p>
<p>You explain your situation, they tell you their advice.</p>
<p>The advice that they&rsquo;re giving you</p>
<p>is not based on your life or your experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s based on their life and their experience.</p>
<p>And the stories that they&rsquo;re telling</p>
<p>are based on experiences they&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>that have very different data points than yours.</p>
<p>So maybe they&rsquo;re giving you good advice,</p>
<p>but maybe they&rsquo;re giving you good advice for them</p>
<p>and not giving you good advice for you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s easy when we try something</p>
<p>and have a result, a positive result,</p>
<p>thinking this is, everybody can do this.</p>
<p>You know, the way I was vegan for a long time, 22 years,</p>
<p>and then I started eating animal protein,</p>
<p>and then eventually changed my diet a few times</p>
<p>to the point where I lost a lot of weight.</p>
<p>The way that I did it worked for me.</p>
<p>Right before that happened,</p>
<p>I did something that I was told</p>
<p>that everyone else who did what you did,</p>
<p>they all lost weight for whatever reason I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So the idea that we know what&rsquo;s right for someone else,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s hard enough to even figure out</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s right for ourselves.</p>
<p>And if we do somehow crack the code of what&rsquo;s right for us,</p>
<p>be happy we have it, and then still know,</p>
<p>I wonder if that&rsquo;s the only way.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s an even better way that we&rsquo;re not considering.</p>
<p>Like not to get comfortable with thinking</p>
<p>we know how it works,</p>
<p>just because we get the outcome we want.</p>
<p>I was raised in science with a principle.</p>
<p>It was literally dictated to me as a principle,</p>
<p>almost like a rule of religion,</p>
<p>which was that the brain is plastic.</p>
<p>It can change and learn until you&rsquo;re about 25,</p>
<p>and then the critical periods end and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And this was a rule,</p>
<p>essentially it was dictated a Nobel Prize,</p>
<p>which was very deserved,</p>
<p>given to my scientific great-grandparents,</p>
<p>they deserve it.</p>
<p>But I was told there was no changing</p>
<p>of brain structure function in any meaningful way</p>
<p>after age 25 or so.</p>
<p>Turns out that&rsquo;s completely wrong.</p>
<p>Sorry, David and Torsten, but they knew it was wrong.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was actively suppressed</p>
<p>because of the competitive nature</p>
<p>of prizes and discoveries at that time.</p>
<p>And a guy named Mike Merzenich</p>
<p>and a student, Greg Reckin&rsquo;s own,</p>
<p>were showing that adult plasticity exists.</p>
<p>And only now is this really starting to emerge as a theme.</p>
<p>Just crazy.</p>
<p>There were so many reasons and the textbook said it,</p>
<p>we were all told it, and it changed our behavior.</p>
<p>Now we know this to be completely false.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plasticity throughout the lifespan.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s limits to it here and there,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just far and away a different story.</p>
<p>So why would that be the only time that ever happened?</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>But the field was run by a very small cabal</p>
<p>of people at that time.</p>
<p>All fields are run by a very small cabal of people</p>
<p>who have an investment in things being the way they are now</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re in charge.</p>
<p>And one of the great things about getting older</p>
<p>is that, well, fortunately, everyone eventually ages.</p>
<p>And I hope that, you know, David unfortunately passed away.</p>
<p>He was lovely, Torsten&rsquo;s lovely, he&rsquo;s still alive.</p>
<p>And they would say, I think Torsten would say,</p>
<p>yeah, we should have been a little more open or kind</p>
<p>in allowing these other ideas.</p>
<p>But I think that-</p>
<p>But just think about all the years that were wasted</p>
<p>with this misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>And it went beyond that.</p>
<p>And there were BBC specials that helped propagate this.</p>
<p>And, you know, one of the goals of the podcast</p>
<p>has been to try and shine light on ideas</p>
<p>that at first seemed crazy.</p>
<p>Like I know you and I are both semi-obsessed</p>
<p>with the health benefits of light.</p>
<p>And you hear about this stuff like negative ion therapy.</p>
<p>Sounds crazy, right?</p>
<p>Sounds like something you would only hear about</p>
<p>at Esalen or in Big Sur.</p>
<p>Turns out negative ionization therapy for sleep and mood</p>
<p>is based on really amazing work out of Columbia</p>
<p>by a guy named Michael Terman.</p>
<p>The Nobel Prize, I think it was in 1916,</p>
<p>was given for phototherapy for the treatment of lupus.</p>
<p>Like this idea that certain wavelengths of light</p>
<p>can help treat medical conditions is not a new idea.</p>
<p>But somehow we see a red light.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not used to seeing red lights</p>
<p>except in sunsets and on stoplights.</p>
<p>And somehow it bothers people or it makes them feel like-</p>
<p>Well, it undermines a business model</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t take red light into consideration.</p>
<p>Right, until it does.</p>
<p>And then it was, and then it&rsquo;s co-opted there.</p>
<p>And the place, what I look to is acupuncture.</p>
<p>You know, for a lot of years people said,</p>
<p>well, acupuncture, this is like no mechanism,</p>
<p>no mechanism, no mechanism.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lab at Harvard, a guy named Chufu Ma,</p>
<p>who I know reasonably well, whose laboratory is dedicated</p>
<p>to trying to figure out the biological mechanisms</p>
<p>of acupuncture.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re discovering what everyone has known</p>
<p>for thousands of years, which is that incredible effects</p>
<p>on anti-inflammation, the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>I have a friend who was having a terrible back problem.</p>
<p>And I suggested that he see an acupuncturist.</p>
<p>And he went to the acupuncturist that I suggested</p>
<p>and his back problem completely healed</p>
<p>almost instantaneously.</p>
<p>And I asked him, you know, have you been keeping up?</p>
<p>Because he had another flare up.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, no, I can&rsquo;t go back there</p>
<p>because acupuncture doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>I said, well, you saw it work for you.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah, but there&rsquo;s no science.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, he&rsquo;s got it.</p>
<p>There is, now there&rsquo;s good science.</p>
<p>And published in premier journals.</p>
<p>It, you know, what&rsquo;s interesting is,</p>
<p>this is a little bit of science editorial,</p>
<p>but since we like to exchange information about health</p>
<p>and things of that sort,</p>
<p>the editorial staff of a journal dictates</p>
<p>what gets published and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And the premier journals have an outsized effect</p>
<p>on what the media covers.</p>
<p>And so the beautiful thing is the journal staff now</p>
<p>is of the age that they grew up</p>
<p>hearing about acupuncture.</p>
<p>Hypnosis has a powerful clinical effect,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s done right.</p>
<p>Yoga Nidra and similar practices.</p>
<p>And so the tides are changing,</p>
<p>but I sometimes like to take a step back and think,</p>
<p>what are we confronted with now that seems crazy</p>
<p>that in 10 years, the kids that will be the,</p>
<p>because to me, they&rsquo;re kids, will be journal editors.</p>
<p>Like, oh yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m making this up,</p>
<p>but putting tuning forks against your head</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Like sound wave therapy.</p>
<p>I think when one adopts a stance of,</p>
<p>we have to filter everything through</p>
<p>the limitations of our biology,</p>
<p>but also through the sociology of like the way culture goes,</p>
<p>it becomes a different story.</p>
<p>How do you deal with that?</p>
<p>Not just in terms of health,</p>
<p>but in terms of thinking about anything.</p>
<p>It sounds like you don&rsquo;t spend a whole lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about what people are gonna think is cool or not.</p>
<p>No, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a punk rocker at heart.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You still are.</p>
<p>Yes, I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I just know what I like and what I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I know what works for me and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You know, I try things and I&rsquo;m constantly looking</p>
<p>for new, better solutions to anything.</p>
<p>And wherever they come from, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It could come from, it could come from Stanford</p>
<p>or it could come from the guy talking to himself</p>
<p>on the street.</p>
<p>If it works, I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>You know, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter to me at all.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hold, I don&rsquo;t hold any of it tightly.</p>
<p>Well, fortunately there&rsquo;s now a division</p>
<p>of the National Institutes of Health</p>
<p>called Complementary Health,</p>
<p>Complementary and Alternative Health.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>NCCIH is run by a woman who has published on,</p>
<p>this is interesting, some of the anti-cancer effects</p>
<p>of things like acupuncture.</p>
<p>Not that acupuncture can cure all cancers,</p>
<p>but real, you know, real data.</p>
<p>That I think for a lot of people, you know,</p>
<p>certainly of the generation above us, you know,</p>
<p>they just are like not interested.</p>
<p>It sheds new light on the Andrew Wiles,</p>
<p>the Paul Stamets&rsquo;, you know, the wild ones.</p>
<p>Ozone therapy or there&rsquo;s so many,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many we can look at.</p>
<p>I mean, for a long time,</p>
<p>nutrition was just thought of as something</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t matter what you eat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what medicine you take and what, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the food is everything.</p>
<p>Food is a powerful, powerful variable.</p>
<p>In the landscape of online nutrition,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of one of the third rails</p>
<p>for anyone like myself who&rsquo;s out there on social media.</p>
<p>You do a very good job of putting out posts</p>
<p>on Twitter and Instagram, but each day you take it down,</p>
<p>you put up a new one.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t talk about any, I only talk about, you know,</p>
<p>I talk about creative ideas.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t talk about anything specific related to anything</p>
<p>other than, you know, maybe something like</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t believe what you hear.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>Well, in the landscape of nutrition,</p>
<p>sometimes I now place it through the filter</p>
<p>of professional wrestling.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got your vegans and your omnivores</p>
<p>and your carnivore MD, and you&rsquo;ve got liver king,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got everything in between, right?</p>
<p>So you could translate that to any number</p>
<p>of different areas.</p>
<p>Fashion probably has its people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not aware of who they are.</p>
<p>Music has theirs, and sports has theirs,</p>
<p>and science has theirs, characters.</p>
<p>So are we all just pro-wrestling like characters</p>
<p>in these different domains?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re taking ourselves and each other</p>
<p>way too seriously?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s all, we don&rsquo;t know anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all, if someone has an idea</p>
<p>and it sounds interesting to you, try it.</p>
<p>And if it doesn&rsquo;t work, it&rsquo;s okay, try something else.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an empiricist.</p>
<p>Yeah, whatever works, whatever works.</p>
<p>And if something seems interesting to you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re excited by it, why not try it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, I try very fringy things.</p>
<p>I like, in some ways, the more unrealistic it seems,</p>
<p>the more interesting it is to me.</p>
<p>Because I feel like that&rsquo;s getting closer</p>
<p>to something that somebody doesn&rsquo;t want me to know,</p>
<p>you know?</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not a big drug guy,</p>
<p>like the big psychedelic craze that&rsquo;s happening now</p>
<p>and that happened some years back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not against it, it just has never been</p>
<p>something that I&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, it&rsquo;s an interesting area</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s definitely making it headway</p>
<p>inside of standard academic science and medicine now.</p>
<p>So that-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in non-pharmalogical approaches to things,</p>
<p>whatever they are.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m a big believer that also</p>
<p>that behavioral do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts first</p>
<p>are the, they&rsquo;re the most fun to explore.</p>
<p>Because in general, unless it&rsquo;s something like, you know,</p>
<p>jumping between buildings, doing parkour or something,</p>
<p>most of the time, you&rsquo;re not going to injure</p>
<p>or harm yourself.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more room for iteration</p>
<p>than there is with a pill or a potion.</p>
<p>Although, you know, certainly pharmacology has its place.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve had creative works,</p>
<p>certainly within the realm of music,</p>
<p>also comedy and producing film and other things.</p>
<p>For somebody out there who, of whatever age,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re creating,</p>
<p>maybe they know they have this creative antennae,</p>
<p>not the sources outside.</p>
<p>What was it that Strummer said?</p>
<p>I actually wrote this on the wall of my laboratory.</p>
<p>No input, no output.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Strummer&rsquo;s law.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s written in my laboratory.</p>
<p>The people in my lab were so like, what&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>I think one guy under knew what that was,</p>
<p>but it was a picture of him and picture of my bulldog.</p>
<p>And, you know, no input, no output.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I can just stay in a room</p>
<p>with four walls and a ceiling and nothing else and create.</p>
<p>I mean, I know that there&rsquo;s a certain number</p>
<p>of things in here,</p>
<p>but I do think accessing the world is important.</p>
<p>The world is giving us clues all the time</p>
<p>for paying attention.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another part of it.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re paying attention,</p>
<p>the thing that you are looking for</p>
<p>is being either whispered or screamed at you</p>
<p>in the outside world, if you&rsquo;re paying attention.</p>
<p>Well, and I forget the exact title of the chapter,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a chapter about staying open to clues</p>
<p>or being on the lookout for clues.</p>
<p>Now I feel tempted to look for the exact title</p>
<p>of that chapter, but-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably look for clues.</p>
<p>It was look for clues.</p>
<p>Sounds like it sounds right.</p>
<p>And since you wrote it, I&rsquo;m guessing that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So do you think there are clues in everywhere?</p>
<p>Yes, I think there are clues everywhere.</p>
<p>If we pay attention, we&rsquo;ll hear a phrase,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll trigger a thought, we&rsquo;ll see something unexpected.</p>
<p>If someone recommends something to you,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s a coincidence.</p>
<p>If three people recommend the same thing to you,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s not, you know, who knows?</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>I do believe the universe is on the side of creativity.</p>
<p>And the universe is supporting things to happen.</p>
<p>And they can happen through you,</p>
<p>or they could happen through someone else.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re paying attention,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;ll happen through you.</p>
<p>We had a guest on the podcast named Justin Sonnenberg.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an expert in the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>And he applied something that, without knowing,</p>
<p>he applied the opposite principle.</p>
<p>The opposite is true principle.</p>
<p>We were talking about these trillions of gut microbiota</p>
<p>that clearly are doing amazing things to create</p>
<p>neurotransmitters and govern our brain,</p>
<p>and even decision-making,</p>
<p>how much sugar is in our system, driving appetite, et cetera.</p>
<p>And he said, you know, we think of them as cargo.</p>
<p>But like, maybe we&rsquo;re just vehicles and they&rsquo;re in charge.</p>
<p>That all of our interactions,</p>
<p>like every time we shake hands or touch our eyes,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re exchanging gut microbiota.</p>
<p>And we think of intelligence as thinking and intelligence.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a microbiologist.</p>
<p>And in all seriousness, he said,</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;re the ones being manipulated.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the house cats.</p>
<p>And we think here we are,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re falling in love and kissing and shaking hands</p>
<p>and washing hands and doing all sorts of things</p>
<p>to isolate or connect with one another.</p>
<p>And maybe the gut microbiota are really trying</p>
<p>to optimize their survival.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Laird Hamilton said that one point in the sauna,</p>
<p>that when you&rsquo;re in the sauna and it&rsquo;s really hot,</p>
<p>the feeling that you have of wanting to get out</p>
<p>could be the bad critters in your body that can&rsquo;t handle it.</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s get out of here.</p>
<p>Are trying to convince you from the inside to get out.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s where that feeling of being compelled</p>
<p>to get out comes from.</p>
<p>So Elon, getting us all to Mars might be a bit of,</p>
<p>maybe they just want to get to Mars.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re-</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to feel like I&rsquo;m channeling Lex Friedman here</p>
<p>for a moment.</p>
<p>No, I think this considering the opposite is really key.</p>
<p>And while it might sound mystical to people</p>
<p>or a little bit like we&rsquo;re just playing with ideas,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s exactly what you do in science.</p>
<p>Someone walks in with a result and says,</p>
<p>I found this, this is true.</p>
<p>And you say, but what if it&rsquo;s all something else?</p>
<p>A good example might be here,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pulling from podcast episodes that we&rsquo;ve had,</p>
<p>but Aaliyah Crum is this amazing psychologist</p>
<p>who works on belief effects.</p>
<p>Your knowledge strongly shapes the physiological outcome.</p>
<p>And she had this amazing graduate thesis where she said,</p>
<p>what if all of exercise is placebo?</p>
<p>All of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it burns some calories and does some things.</p>
<p>Turns out this isn&rsquo;t the case,</p>
<p>but it turns out a lot of the effects of exercise,</p>
<p>positive effects, lowering blood pressure,</p>
<p>relieving stress, positive, are placebo.</p>
<p>But nobody thinks of it like that</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re so attached to calories burned, et cetera.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a big point that the belief part of it</p>
<p>is a huge part of the conversation about everything.</p>
<p>You know, what we believe has power.</p>
<p>If we believe we can make something great,</p>
<p>the chances of us making something great are better</p>
<p>than if we don&rsquo;t believe we can.</p>
<p>So I would say any ability to harness your belief</p>
<p>on your behalf is a really healthy thing to do.</p>
<p>And one thing that you make very clear</p>
<p>is that while our own abilities may come into question</p>
<p>from time to time, you absolutely believe</p>
<p>that the elements from which to create are out there.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>All the elements are here.</p>
<p>Everything is here.</p>
<p>We get to pick and choose.</p>
<p>We get to, the conveyor belt&rsquo;s going by</p>
<p>with the little gifts.</p>
<p>And we can, first we have to notice</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a conveyor belt.</p>
<p>Then we notice the gifts.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s the starting point.</p>
<p>And then we may even feel empowered enough</p>
<p>to grab one of the gifts and open it up</p>
<p>and see what&rsquo;s inside.</p>
<p>And then maybe that&rsquo;s the start</p>
<p>of something really beautiful</p>
<p>that we wouldn&rsquo;t have done.</p>
<p>Everything that I make or have made</p>
<p>has always been based on something that I see or hear</p>
<p>that allows me to see something that I didn&rsquo;t see before.</p>
<p>So I was going to ask you whether or not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to be happy in order to create,</p>
<p>but certainly a lot of people that were unhappy</p>
<p>were still able to create.</p>
<p>But the more I listened to you,</p>
<p>it seems that it&rsquo;s really about an ability</p>
<p>to pay attention.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m unhappy or if I&rsquo;m happy,</p>
<p>may not be as relevant as whether or not</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m able to stay undistracted.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I would say that&rsquo;s, I would say being able</p>
<p>to stay present in the work</p>
<p>is probably the most important part of it.</p>
<p>And how you feel is less of an issue</p>
<p>unless how you feel gets in the way of you feeling</p>
<p>how the work makes you feel.</p>
<p>Do you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a lot of pain</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re looking at a piece of art,</p>
<p>it may be hard to know how that art makes you feel</p>
<p>because the big signal in your body is the physical pain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are some people who can do that too,</p>
<p>who can even through the physical pain can feel it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this idea of transmutation</p>
<p>of taking one emotion and contorting it</p>
<p>and co-opting it into another action in an adaptive way.</p>
<p>But this idea of distraction being a problem,</p>
<p>this really resonates, I think,</p>
<p>when I think of times of great productivity</p>
<p>is when I was able to be undistracted.</p>
<p>I could also see how success can be its own distraction.</p>
<p>This is often discussed in the context of fighting sports</p>
<p>where someone starts making a lot of money</p>
<p>and pretty soon their focus becomes all the things</p>
<p>they can access with their success</p>
<p>as opposed to the thing that got them there</p>
<p>in the first place.</p>
<p>Keeping an underdog mentality.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Before we conclude, I do want to ask you</p>
<p>about one other aspect of process, which is meditation.</p>
<p>Meditation is interesting to me</p>
<p>because when we close our eyes,</p>
<p>as most meditations are done,</p>
<p>and we focus on our brain, our brain has no sensation.</p>
<p>Like if we-</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say we focus on our brain.</p>
<p>Or we focus on something other than our normal experience.</p>
<p>How would you define meditation?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>There are different types of meditation.</p>
<p>Usually, either way,</p>
<p>I would say there&rsquo;s no form of meditation</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re focused on our brain.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad we disagree.</p>
<p>I would say here are the things that happen.</p>
<p>We either are engaging in a mantra,</p>
<p>which would be a version of almost like</p>
<p>creating a trance for ourselves,</p>
<p>not unlike listening to something when we go to sleep</p>
<p>that would distract our conscious mind</p>
<p>from participating.</p>
<p>We would be overriding the talking mind</p>
<p>with just a sound that we&rsquo;re generating,</p>
<p>or a word, or a phrase, series of phrases.</p>
<p>A meta meditation is a loving kindness meditation</p>
<p>with phrases.</p>
<p>Could be that.</p>
<p>Or it could be focused on the breath.</p>
<p>But the purpose of being focused on the breath</p>
<p>is to not hear the self-talk that we normally have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a single-pointed focus exercise</p>
<p>in those that I described.</p>
<p>The other version is an awareness meditation</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re closing your eyes</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re being with whatever is and noticing.</p>
<p>So if we were to do it now,</p>
<p>and you could do it eyes open or eyes closed</p>
<p>with an awareness practice.</p>
<p>But the first thing that I would do is I would feel,</p>
<p>I feel a little ringing in my ears.</p>
<p>It might be from the electronic equipment around us,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t mean that I hear the sound.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a vibration.</p>
<p>I hear cars passing in the distance.</p>
<p>See what else comes up.</p>
<p>I can feel a feeling in my chest.</p>
<p>I can feel this part of my face, not sure why.</p>
<p>Feels like it&rsquo;s related to my jaw.</p>
<p>More car sounds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware of a little feeling of warmth.</p>
<p>So now I would say the room feels a bit warm.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t aware of that before</p>
<p>when I wasn&rsquo;t just being with what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Feel a little itch on my left shoulder.</p>
<p>So that would be an awareness practice,</p>
<p>which is another kind of meditation</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re just paying attention to what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no story.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no this means this, none of those things.</p>
<p>Just like an inventory almost</p>
<p>of everything that comes up when it comes up,</p>
<p>and you do that for a period of time.</p>
<p>But in all of those cases,</p>
<p>in the example of doing the awareness meditation</p>
<p>or doing a mantra meditation or focusing on the breath,</p>
<p>in none of them am I thinking,</p>
<p>in none of them am I concentrating on,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being aware of sense perceptions in the awareness one,</p>
<p>or in the other meditations, I&rsquo;m doing a practice</p>
<p>so that I&rsquo;m not aware of thinking about anything else.</p>
<p>When did you start meditating</p>
<p>and how often do you meditate now?</p>
<p>I learned when I was 14 and I started with TM,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s probably the meditation</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve done the most in my life.</p>
<p>And I come back to, although I tried many different kinds</p>
<p>and also different physical forms of meditation,</p>
<p>Tai Chi, things like that.</p>
<p>I meditated for five or six years,</p>
<p>and then I stopped when I went to school to university.</p>
<p>And then I started again several years later.</p>
<p>And when I started again,</p>
<p>I realized how profound it was in me</p>
<p>that I had done it when I did it.</p>
<p>So I usually have some sort of a practice.</p>
<p>In some ways, the beach walks could be a form of meditation.</p>
<p>But for me, typically I would wake up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be the first thing I would do</p>
<p>during that sort of in-between time,</p>
<p>maybe go out in the sun, close my eyes and meditate</p>
<p>before starting my day.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m doing it twice a day,</p>
<p>the second time would probably be right before dinner</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m doing it on a regular schedule.</p>
<p>Then if I find myself on an airplane,</p>
<p>I might meditate for an hour or for the&hellip;</p>
<p>I can remember one time meditating the entire flight</p>
<p>from New York to LA,</p>
<p>just was a great opportunity to do a deep dive.</p>
<p>And time passes, you lose track of time.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like going to sleep and waking up.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t feel like that was eight hours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just time stops.</p>
<p>Not always, but when it does, it&rsquo;s a great feeling.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;ve sent me some meditations,</p>
<p>including the one that you did on that transatlantic</p>
<p>or transcontinental flight.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been trying to do longer and longer meditations,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve always meditated a little bit,</p>
<p>but your meditation practice is one</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m starting to adopt.</p>
<p>Maybe we could convince you to give us</p>
<p>suggestions of one or two,</p>
<p>and we can link out to them for listeners.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;d appreciate that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also meditation-like practices to do</p>
<p>that involve, like there&rsquo;s something called</p>
<p>the surgical series from the Monroe Institute,</p>
<p>which I used when I had a surgery.</p>
<p>You listen to this recording</p>
<p>and it both allows your body to heal much faster.</p>
<p>And remove some of the trauma that goes on</p>
<p>when getting cut open, it&rsquo;s traumatic.</p>
<p>But just through listening to certain things,</p>
<p>you can have a really powerful effect, heal much faster.</p>
<p>I remember I was about to be put under for a surgery,</p>
<p>and my eyes were closed and I wasn&rsquo;t communicating</p>
<p>with anyone there because I was going inside.</p>
<p>And my wife was with me and they came in and they said,</p>
<p>oh, so they already gave Rick the sedative</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s ready to wheel in.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, I didn&rsquo;t give him anything.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, but look at his numbers, like, yeah.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s an amazingly powerful practice.</p>
<p>I like, because anyone can cultivate.</p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no good or bad version.</p>
<p>It really is just, if you learn a technique</p>
<p>and show up and do it, it works.</p>
<p>Well, I love that you&rsquo;re so willing to share</p>
<p>what you do and your process.</p>
<p>And listen, I just want to say thank you</p>
<p>for a number of things.</p>
<p>I want to thank you for the music you&rsquo;ve created</p>
<p>and that you are to create</p>
<p>because we want to be still ongoing.</p>
<p>Certainly for your time today</p>
<p>and sharing your thought process</p>
<p>and a bit of what goes into this incredible</p>
<p>creative process.</p>
<p>And I want to thank you for writing the book.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t talk about or feature many books</p>
<p>on the podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not something we typically do,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve seen a little bit of the evolution of it.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ve seen it now and read through it</p>
<p>in its final form twice, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to continue to read through it again.</p>
<p>It is one of those books where it is so filled with gems,</p>
<p>like every chapter, like I could take notes on this</p>
<p>and take notes on this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s assembled in a very digestible way</p>
<p>that allows people to extract the meaningful parts</p>
<p>in every chapter.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many in a way that&rsquo;s very straightforward.</p>
<p>So I love the book.</p>
<p>So thank you for doing it</p>
<p>because you certainly didn&rsquo;t have to write a book,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m so happy that you did.</p>
<p>And I know that I&rsquo;ve already benefited.</p>
<p>I know so many people are going to benefit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an amazing book</p>
<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t help but put my neuroscience lens on it.</p>
<p>But I also about halfway through,</p>
<p>I learned to discard my preexisting lens a bit</p>
<p>and start to see things through what I think</p>
<p>is a different perspective.</p>
<p>So I just want to thank you</p>
<p>for being such an incredible portal</p>
<p>and also for being an amazing friend.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so happy to be here with you.</p>
<p>And anytime I get to see you, it&rsquo;s a good day.</p>
<p>Likewise.</p>

<p>for you creative types out there,</p>
<p>for those of you that seek to be more creative</p>
<p>or to understand the creative process generally.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned at the beginning of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>Rick has very generously offered</p>
<p>to answer your questions about creativity.</p>

<p>but on many episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>we discuss supplements.</p>
<p>While supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>for things like enhancing the depth and quality of sleep,</p>
<p>for enhancing focus and for hormone support,</p>
<p>and many other aspects of mental health,</p>
<p>physical health and performance.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab podcast is proud to announce</p>
<p>that we are now partnered with Momentous Supplements</p>
<p>because Momentous Supplements</p>
<p>are of the very highest quality.</p>
<p>They ship internationally</p>
<p>and they have single ingredient formulations,</p>
<p>which turns out to be important</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to develop the most cost-effective</p>
<p>and biologically effective supplementation regimen.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to access the supplements</p>
<p>discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>you can go to LiveMomentous, spelled O-U-S,</p>
<p>so livemomentous.com slash Huberman.</p>

<p>LinkedIn, and Facebook.</p>
<p>In all of those places,</p>
<p>I talk about science and science-related tools,</p>
<p>some of which overlap with the content</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>but much of which is distinct from the content</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s Huberman Lab on all social media handles,</p>
<p>all platforms, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn.</p>
