<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>
<p>﻿hey guys welcome back I wanted to do a video on 
the difference between not losing weight versus  </p>
<p>slow weight loss and the reason is if a lot 
of times we&rsquo;ll have people that will contact  </p>
<p>me and they&rsquo;re saying I&rsquo;m not losing weight 
okay then I find out they are losing weight  </p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just incredibly slow so there&rsquo;s a huge 
difference between not losing any weight at all  </p>
<p>and losing some weight okay I mean the actions 
that you would do if you weren&rsquo;t losing weight  </p>
<p>are going to be completely different than what 
you would do if you have slow weight loss so let&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>take a look at that you put someone on the right 
program and by the way I always want to make sure  </p>
<p>that the data that someone&rsquo;s giving me is correct 
so sometimes if they tell me I&rsquo;m eating perfectly  </p>
<p>right and I don&rsquo;t actually find out what they&rsquo;re 
eating I could find out it&rsquo;s not perfect and that  </p>
<p>has happened so many times also you could have 
someone that is possibly cheating and they&rsquo;re not  </p>
<p>telling you that&rsquo;s a possibility so those things 
you want to rule out but the point is if they  </p>
<p>did everything right is they&rsquo;re not losing weight 
then you have to make a huge change okay there&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>some seriously something stuck in their body it 
could be with the thyroid it could be with the  </p>
<p>adrenal could be with a kidney and that were just 
requires more data more testing I need to dig deep  </p>
<p>and find out what is behind that okay so that&rsquo;s 
if you&rsquo;re not losing anything if you&rsquo;re having  </p>
<p>slow weight loss it&rsquo;s like molasses you&rsquo;re losing 
some but it&rsquo;s too gradual you don&rsquo;t want to make a  </p>
<p>huge change all you want to do is strengthen the 
successful actions okay so that&rsquo;s very different  </p>
<p>because if I make so many changes right here all 
of a sudden can turn from here to here so so we  </p>
<p>want to look at the quality in the quantity of the 
food so we look at the quality of the protein are  </p>
<p>there doing soy protein isolates are they doing 
too much protein powder is it low-fat protein  </p>
<p>powder that actually raises insulin or what about 
the quality of the fat are they doing corn oil  </p>
<p>or or soy oil really bad quality are they doing 
low quality carbohydrates are they doing sports  </p>
<p>drinks so they&rsquo;re doing just pure sugar with fine 
carbohydrates like refined breads and things like  </p>
<p>so we look at the quality and then look at the 
quantity the protein is it too high is it between  </p>
<p>three to six ounces what about the fats is it too 
low or maybe too high sometimes they can&rsquo;t they&rsquo;re  </p>
<p>not used to digesting all the fat and maybe maybe 
the meal is so large and the metabolism is so small  </p>
<p>we have to adjust that some people unfortunately 
have such a damaged metabolism they need to have </p>
<p>smaller meals or less frequent meals okay just 
because everything is molasses I&rsquo;ll get to that  </p>
<p>in a second so the quality and quantity of these 
proteins carbohydrates and fats are vital and  </p>
<p>then we look at the frequency of eating now are 
they doing six meals a day or right there I&rsquo;m  </p>
<p>going to put them to three meals a day because 
six meals a day is a lot of insulin every time  </p>
<p>you eat by spiking insulin or maybe they&rsquo;re 
at three maybe I need to push them down to two  </p>
<p>meals a day okay without any like intermittent 
fasting in between no anything between the meals  </p>
<p>a lot of people are very successful with that 
but there&rsquo;s a small group of people that just  </p>
<p>have a very very slow metabolism that I have to 
put on one meal a day now you might say that&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>starvation but it&rsquo;s not because they&rsquo;re having 
a very large meal all the nutrients but their  </p>
<p>system is so slow that they can run efficiently 
or should I say their system is so efficient they  </p>
<p>can run on very small amounts of food because 
it&rsquo;s such a slow machine so on some people we  </p>
<p>have to do that and they eventually lose weight 
because the&hellip; because the system has been  </p>
<p>damaged over their life specially if they&rsquo;ve been 
dieting as a kid or you know ever since like like  </p>
<p>sometimes even parents put the kids on a diet when 
they&rsquo;re four or five years old well that&rsquo;s going  </p>
<p>to really mess up things later in life okay now 
the other thing we look at if it&rsquo;s slow is there  </p>
<p>other body problems the quality of sleep is there 
bladder waking them up is it hot flashes is it  </p>
<p>sinus like sleep apnea do they have those issues 
because it&rsquo;s not sleeping that&rsquo;s going to make it  </p>
<p>slow I look at digestion are they constipated do 
they have heartburn they have ulcers all that is  </p>
<p>just a symptom that there is a digestive issue I 
mean I&rsquo;ll even put people on a good probiotic and  </p>
<p>all of a sudden they start losing weight or what 
about their menstrual cycle the menstrual cycle  </p>
<p>being too heavy that indicate too much estrogen 
and that right there can stop the weight loss  </p>
<p>too much estrogen but I don&rsquo;t ever support the 
weight loss directly with a pill or a nutrient  </p>
<p>because that doesn&rsquo;t work there&rsquo;s so many pills 
out so that people use that say oh yeah take this  </p>
<p>weight-loss pill that doesn&rsquo;t work because the 
weight is always a symptom of something else so  </p>
<p>we know most of the way problems are related to 
insulin and insulin resistance so if you support  </p>
<p>that problem you&rsquo;ll be way more successful the 
really the only weight loss pill that I use is  </p>
<p>something called insulin and glucose support 
which is I&rsquo;ll put a link down there if you  </p>
<p>want more information but it supports insulin 
directly it lowers insulin and that actually  </p>
<p>helps because in the presence of insulin you&rsquo;re 
not going to lose weight and some people even  </p>
<p>our pre-diabetic or diabetic they lose weight 
but they still have a little insulin problem  </p>
<p>they need some support that&rsquo;s when I would use 
some nutrition with that okay so I just wanted  </p>
<p>to differentiate no weight loss or slow waves 
weight loss what category are you in and things  </p>
<p>that you can do to speed things up thanks for 
watching hey if you&rsquo;re enjoying my videos press  </p>

updated on the future event thank you so much</p>
