    <p>I really understand now why people don&rsquo;t fucking make videos like this.</p>
<p>This is hard as fuck to talk about.</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all about to hear all my darkest shit.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it, I guess.</p>
<p>Hi friends!</p>
<p>So, this week, I&rsquo;m gonna tell you a lot of things that I&rsquo;ve never told anyone.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna be talking about suicide, and death, and very dark shit, like the darkest</p>
<p>things you can imagine, so if you don&rsquo;t feel like you&rsquo;re in a place to hear about stuff</p>
<p>like that, skip this week&rsquo;s episode.</p>
<p>And this is like your little trigger warning, for all of you that like to freak the fuck</p>
<p>out about that, that think everything needs a fucking trigger warning, okay, dandelion,</p>
<p>you saw the fucking title, what do you think we&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>But for this episode, I&rsquo;m gonna share the darkest shit that I&rsquo;ve been through, the darkest</p>
<p>places I&rsquo;ve been, mentally, emotionally, are, and then how I got out of it.</p>
<p>Because when I was going through my worst shit, no one talks about it.</p>
<p>No one has anything to watch or consume with the fucking truth, and there&rsquo;s nothing to</p>
<p>relate to.</p>
<p>So my hopes and my intention behind making this episode is to give inspiration, one,</p>
<p>help you guys get to know me, but also to be a place where people that are really struggling</p>
<p>can go to when they have no one they can fucking relate to, because hi, been there.</p>
<p>And I am gonna go ahead and clear my ass legally, I&rsquo;m not giving advice in this episode, nothing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying is advice or telling you what to do, because I am gonna be talking about the</p>
<p>topic of suicide, but this is all my personal experience and my story.</p>
<p>Like I said, nothing&rsquo;s advice, don&rsquo;t try and come at me with no legal fucking bullshit.</p>
<p>Everybody shut up.</p>
<p>This is a deep ass topic, and I&rsquo;ll be fucked if somebody is gonna try and come at me sideways</p>
<p>about it.</p>
<p>Girl, if you don&rsquo;t like real life, go watch somebody else.</p>
<p>And the first thing I want to say is a little message.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re contemplating suicide, or you have contemplated it before, it makes sense why</p>
<p>you would contemplate it, because it&rsquo;s a relief from pain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been there, I know it.</p>
<p>But the only reason you have not acted on it yet, if you&rsquo;ve been thinking about it,</p>
<p>is because part of you so desperately wants to fucking live.</p>
<p>And that matters.</p>
<p>And whatever it is you&rsquo;re going through, you don&rsquo;t see a way out right now.</p>
<p>But I promise there&rsquo;s a way out.</p>
<p>Do not make a permanent decision based off of something temporary.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m about to share everything that I&rsquo;ve fucking been through, kind of in my whole</p>
<p>life, and then what got me to my breaking point of like where I almost did opt out,</p>
<p>and hopefully this will bring you a little bit of insight and hope.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the best gift I could give you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure how to start this, but let&rsquo;s just jump into it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m 25 years old.</p>
<p>I just had my 25th birthday a couple days ago.</p>
<p>But I have experienced too much too young.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve experienced the worst of the absolute worst at a very young age.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also experienced the best of the best.</p>
<p>But I have experienced and seen way too much for being so young.</p>
<p>I saw and was exposed to the worst things in the world at a very young age.</p>
<p>And it will fuck you up.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just start opening up about some of it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to give you a little bit of a background to get to the point where my life</p>
<p>hit a breaking point.</p>
<p>And all of these things are big key factors.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to do a little background and then I&rsquo;m going to go through all of the shit</p>
<p>and then the night I almost did it.</p>
<p>And you know what I fucking mean by that.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s just jump into this.</p>
<p>Oh my god, I&rsquo;m a little nervous.</p>
<p>So in my early life, I was bullied very bad in school.</p>
<p>Like insane bullying for no fucking reason.</p>
<p>Like from preschool until high school.</p>
<p>Like I was bullied so insanely fucking bad and I never understood why.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that people do not explain about bullying or even talk about is when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re bullied so bad for no fucking reason, it makes you feel so defective.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the feeling states I&rsquo;ve suffered with and struggled with my entire</p>
<p>life is feeling defective.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t anymore.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll kind of explain my way through that.</p>
<p>But feeling defective and feeling powerless are the two biggest things I&rsquo;ve struggled</p>
<p>with.</p>
<p>And those are the two fucking things that will like drive you to where I got to.</p>
<p>But being bullied in school was bad and I&rsquo;m talking like the emotional side of it fucked</p>
<p>me up.</p>
<p>But like the physical, like getting beat and shit was not fun.</p>
<p>And a lot of powerlessness was in that because no one would help me.</p>
<p>No one could help me.</p>
<p>How the fuck do you control like little like school kids, like teenagers, middle schoolers?</p>
<p>How the fuck are you supposed to control them?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I went through such bad bullying.</p>
<p>I would literally go home and like cry to my mom, please don&rsquo;t make me go back to school.</p>
<p>Please do not make me go back to fucking school.</p>
<p>And I would just fucking cry.</p>
<p>And I hated it.</p>
<p>I fucking hated school.</p>
<p>I never wanted to go.</p>
<p>And my mom went up to my school and like talked to my teachers.</p>
<p>She talked to the principals.</p>
<p>She talked to the deans.</p>
<p>She talked to everyone.</p>
<p>And no one would help me.</p>
<p>Like no one would do anything.</p>
<p>I was just literally subject to fucking living hell every time I went to school.</p>
<p>Just going to school enough is shit.</p>
<p>And then to be bullied on top of it.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people deal with bullying and my shit was like next level for no fucking</p>
<p>reason.</p>
<p>I genuinely never understood it.</p>
<p>But no one would help me.</p>
<p>I felt so powerless.</p>
<p>There was nothing I could do.</p>
<p>I would literally beg these people to stop.</p>
<p>Like stop hurting me.</p>
<p>And they wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I was never shown mercy once in my fucking life.</p>
<p>From anyone or anything.</p>
<p>And y&rsquo;all are lucky I fucking grant it to you.</p>
<p>Because what the fuck I&rsquo;ve turned into because of it?</p>
<p>Oh please.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>Now everybody wants to attack me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the asshole because I fucking turned the knife the other way.</p>
<p>How do you like it, bitch?</p>
<p>But anyway, I digress.</p>
<p>I was bullied so fucking bad I was literally backed into a wall.</p>
<p>Like I didn&rsquo;t know how to fix it.</p>
<p>How to stop it.</p>
<p>And my dad literally looked at me one day.</p>
<p>And so did my mom.</p>
<p>They were like, we&rsquo;ve done everything we can.</p>
<p>Fucking swing.</p>
<p>Like start beating the fuck out of these kids.</p>
<p>And maybe they&rsquo;ll stop.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;ve tried everything else.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I did.</p>
<p>Every single person who ever made fun of me or hurt me or did anything, I started beating</p>
<p>the absolute fuck out of.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m proud I did it.</p>
<p>And my only regret in this life is not doing it earlier.</p>
<p>Because fuck all of you.</p>
<p>And all of you that watch me now, trying to be friends with me now, do not ever, in your</p>
<p>fucking life, think we will ever be cool.</p>
<p>We will never be friends.</p>
<p>I will never fucking forgive you, ever, for what you&rsquo;ve done to little Leo.</p>
<p>I wish you nothing but the fucking worst in life.</p>
<p>You ruined my fucking childhood.</p>
<p>And you guys fucked me up.</p>
<p>I will never help you.</p>
<p>And like I said, wish you nothing but the worst.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t watch my episodes because they&rsquo;re going to help you.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t want to fight.</p>
<p>I really didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It was just the only way to stop being tormented and like abused as a kid.</p>
<p>So I had to do what I had to do.</p>
<p>But that feeling of no one ever looking out for me, that one will get you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to pop up again.</p>
<p>Next thing.</p>
<p>The next really big thing that fucked with me growing up was I was thrown to the side</p>
<p>by everyone.</p>
<p>I was never anyone&rsquo;s favorite.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been anyone&rsquo;s favorite.</p>
<p>And someone else has always been chosen over me.</p>
<p>Even if I did everything right, I was never chosen.</p>
<p>I was never good enough for anyone.</p>
<p>I was never picked.</p>
<p>So that whole feeling of being defective comes up again.</p>
<p>And also with that, shit has always just seemed to work out for other people.</p>
<p>Like things just didn&rsquo;t work out for me like they did for others.</p>
<p>Even if I was 10 times better at something, I was never good enough.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t work out for me.</p>
<p>No one ever wanted me or the situation just didn&rsquo;t line up.</p>
<p>Like it didn&rsquo;t fucking make any logical sense where that happened.</p>
<p>And like when you&rsquo;re a kid, you have nothing to believe or like you have no way to make</p>
<p>sense of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, I guess something&rsquo;s just wrong with me because logically all the proof is</p>
<p>there that I&rsquo;m better, but it&rsquo;s not working or I&rsquo;m not being picked.</p>
<p>So something must be off that I don&rsquo;t know about.</p>
<p>And that is what truly fucks you up because it sends you on a scavenger hunt to find out</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s wrong with you when there actually isn&rsquo;t anything fucking wrong with you.</p>
<p>The next thing for my background is I&rsquo;ve had a medical condition my entire life that is</p>
<p>extremely painful and I&rsquo;m not going to get into the details of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that I still deal with to this day.</p>
<p>And the things that I&rsquo;ve had to do to my own body and the pain that I live with and have</p>
<p>lived with since I&rsquo;m like 10, inexplainable.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no way to heal it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to fully get rid of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried everything and that&rsquo;s just a pain a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize I live with.</p>
<p>And I have lived with it forever.</p>
<p>But just because you have pain for a long time, it doesn&rsquo;t mean it hurts less.</p>
<p>You just get better at dealing with it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a little bit about background of like my childhood.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s walk into more of my adult life.</p>
<p>So when I&rsquo;m 18, I joined nursing school and the things that you see as a nurse will fuck</p>
<p>you up.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why nurses are not paid more, but the psychological side of nursing</p>
<p>is insane.</p>
<p>Like the things that I encountered at such a young age, that was my choice to go into</p>
<p>nursing at a young age.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>I was guided in that direction, but I was willing to take it on and I&rsquo;m a strong fucking</p>
<p>person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been strong since I&rsquo;m a little kid.</p>
<p>So I went into it and I was like, this is what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>But all the things I saw as a nurse, you have no clue.</p>
<p>Like it makes you very in touch with like humility, how fragile the human body is and</p>
<p>the fucked up shit that goes on in real life from like domestic disputes and having to</p>
<p>take care of someone who&rsquo;s been mangled or medical conditions that are uncontrolled and</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t escape them.</p>
<p>I saw everything really that can go wrong with the human body in nursing.</p>
<p>Not everything.</p>
<p>A lot of things.</p>
<p>Definitely enough to fuck me up and change my perspective on a lot.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s something else that was a big contributor to the stack up and the build up of me getting</p>
<p>to a point of suicide.</p>
<p>Another period I kind of missed, it was a little bit before I started nursing, was my</p>
<p>stepdad.</p>
<p>His name was Josh.</p>
<p>And the period of my life where he was in it, I went through an extreme level of torture,</p>
<p>physical abuse, mental and psychological abuse.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a weird dynamic because I&rsquo;ve never felt a sense of safety in my fucking life.</p>
<p>Ever.</p>
<p>Until I met Josh.</p>
<p>He was the only thing I&rsquo;ve ever feared in my life.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s the only thing I think I will ever fear.</p>
<p>Because he showed me what someone&rsquo;s capable of and some of the darkest things in the world.</p>
<p>And he taught me a lot of it by doing it to me.</p>
<p>And putting me through situations to know how to handle them.</p>
<p>His whole thing was like, I&rsquo;m going to teach you and prepare you.</p>
<p>But it was not like that.</p>
<p>Basically he showed me what real fear was.</p>
<p>And showed me what the reality of life is.</p>
<p>And taught me how to handle absolutely anything that can be a physical threat to you.</p>
<p>By being that.</p>
<p>But he was only in my life for a short period, a couple years, because he died from like</p>
<p>a tragic accident.</p>
<p>But when he died, that was a mindfuck of its own because like I said, I was so fearful</p>
<p>of him.</p>
<p>But I was so safe with him because he was so untouchable and showed me so many things</p>
<p>about life and how to handle anything.</p>
<p>There was nothing he couldn&rsquo;t get through.</p>
<p>And I felt so safe having someone like that around.</p>
<p>Because I felt like as long as I was on his good side, as long as his target wasn&rsquo;t set</p>
<p>on me, to hurt me, I couldn&rsquo;t be hurt.</p>
<p>So being made aware and experiencing everything that he put me through and made me realize</p>
<p>about the world and prepared me for was a lot.</p>
<p>But I also had him as the safety to help me.</p>
<p>And then when I lost him, I was just left to be in this world.</p>
<p>He showed me truly how dangerous it is without him.</p>
<p>And I was the only one left that could kind of like be there for myself in the ways that</p>
<p>he was.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t ever feel as like equipped or like good as him.</p>
<p>Like that motherfucker was literally impenetrable.</p>
<p>I had seen him get shot, get stabbed, be hit by cars.</p>
<p>There was multiple times where he put a gun to my head.</p>
<p>So when I say he instilled the fear of life into me, sure as fuck did.</p>
<p>But losing him was really hard and still living day to day without him is kind of hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotten easier with time.</p>
<p>But that sense of safety is something I&rsquo;ll never feel again in my life.</p>
<p>And getting to experience that and then having to live without that is difficult.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s jump into the relationship that absolutely fucked me up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in one relationship my entire life.</p>
<p>I got into it at 21 years old and it was with a 40 year old at the time.</p>
<p>And every single thing you can imagine could go wrong in a relationship went wrong.</p>
<p>Everything you could do to someone, he did to me.</p>
<p>And anything that just popped into your head, yes.</p>
<p>So you guys always ask me a lot, how do I know so much about relationships?</p>
<p>I have had one, but I experienced a lifetime of relationships in that one.</p>
<p>Everything like I said that could go wrong, went wrong.</p>
<p>And I learned how to like navigate it, deal with it, understand it, but there&rsquo;s just so</p>
<p>much shit.</p>
<p>Oh my God, I want to skate past that because Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>But also with that relationship being the worst fucking thing that happened to me, it</p>
<p>also gave me access to some of the best things in life because the person I was with was</p>
<p>very, very rich.</p>
<p>And I got to experience a whole different side of life.</p>
<p>And I was raised by my dad.</p>
<p>He always told me if you don&rsquo;t have money, you have nothing.</p>
<p>And basically instilled it into me that money will save you.</p>
<p>Money is all that you will ever need.</p>
<p>And that is your sense of safety and security.</p>
<p>So when I finally touched the level of money that I was always taught would save me, and</p>
<p>I never felt more empty and scared in my fucking life, I did not know what to do.</p>
<p>Because this thing, money, was supposed to save me.</p>
<p>It was supposed to be the answer.</p>
<p>It was supposed to make everything okay.</p>
<p>And then when I got it, my whole belief system around life flipped.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t understand what the fuck to do.</p>
<p>What was supposed to save me didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What was supposed to make me feel safe didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What was supposed to make me feel happy didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So I was left with devastation while also experiencing one of the best situations to</p>
<p>be in financially.</p>
<p>Very weird dynamic.</p>
<p>But my whole belief system and my whole outlook on life was shattered in that moment.</p>
<p>And when I chose to leave that ex, going back to a normal life after that is very difficult.</p>
<p>And a lot of your relationship to money and your idea about life is fucked.</p>
<p>And trying to rebuild that and recalibrate and readjust to a new reality of going back</p>
<p>to a normal life is real difficult.</p>
<p>But also what came with that was so much confusion because I made the decision to leave that</p>
<p>person and the lifestyle because I wasn&rsquo;t happy.</p>
<p>But to choose out of that lifestyle, go back to a normal life, go back to working as a</p>
<p>nurse and then trying to move forward and continue forward.</p>
<p>My whole vision and my whole goal and what my purpose of my life was going to be was</p>
<p>supposed to be to achieve money and then you can have everything you&rsquo;ve ever wanted.</p>
<p>I got the money and nothing the fuck you want is in it.</p>
<p>Money&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cute.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>It gives you a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better to have it than not have it.</p>
<p>But what was supposed to be wrapped up in that, what I was taught, is not in that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no fulfillment in that shit.</p>
<p>And going back to normal life and having to convince myself to go to work and function</p>
<p>on a daily basis, I had no why anymore.</p>
<p>I had no reason or purpose or anything.</p>
<p>I just felt so confused and hopeless and like, well, if money&rsquo;s not the point of life, then</p>
<p>what the fuck is the point of it?</p>
<p>What am I supposed to be working forward?</p>
<p>To get more money to buy a house, to this, to that?</p>
<p>For what?</p>
<p>I just had it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s empty as fuck.</p>
<p>I was literally like, what now?</p>
<p>And that was a lot.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to do a whole podcast episode about voids money can&rsquo;t fill, so I can help</p>
<p>you avoid that heartbreak once you start making a lot of money and you hit that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not as much tied up in it as you think.</p>
<p>And who you are now is the same person you&rsquo;re going to be with money.</p>
<p>Everything you feel now is going to be the same way you feel.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t run from it.</p>
<p>But while I was going through all this and adjusting to this new way of life, my ex was</p>
<p>destroying my life.</p>
<p>And I did a whole podcast episode, it&rsquo;s episode 60, about the fucked up shit he did to me</p>
<p>and why I started on social media and how all this came about.</p>
<p>All the worst things you can do to someone, like shit you can&rsquo;t even make up for a movie</p>
<p>he was doing to me.</p>
<p>And he was able to do it to me and I couldn&rsquo;t fight back because I didn&rsquo;t have money to</p>
<p>fight him.</p>
<p>He was fucking with me in every way, legally and monetarily, because I didn&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>money to fight back.</p>
<p>So that, ooh, a whole other breed of powerlessness I had never experienced before.</p>
<p>And like I said before, feeling defective and feeling powerless are the two things that</p>
<p>have been a trend in my fucking life that really got me to this point, because every</p>
<p>one of these situations hits on those two, and those be hurt.</p>
<p>So with my ex trying to destroy my life, I truly saw how broken the system is.</p>
<p>The justice system is fucked.</p>
<p>Cops are not here to help you.</p>
<p>Cops are fucking worthless as shit, unless you know a corrupt one that can help you avoid</p>
<p>shit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only time a cop is fucking useful.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t do a fuck thing for you.</p>
<p>No one can help you, and no one&rsquo;s going to look out for you.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not there to protect you, bitch, sorry.</p>
<p>I hate that I&rsquo;m being so aggressive about that, but I&rsquo;m pissed off, and I think I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be pissed off for the rest of my fucking life.</p>
<p>The justice system is not there for you, it&rsquo;s never going to help you.</p>
<p>These people don&rsquo;t give a fuck about you.</p>
<p>Cops are lazy as fuck.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to put their life out on the line for you, they&rsquo;re not going to inconvenience</p>
<p>themselves for you.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you&rsquo;re going through.</p>
<p>And attorneys are not going to do shit unless you pay them.</p>
<p>And also judges are money hungry as fuck, and if you pay them, they&rsquo;ll sway things in</p>
<p>your favor.</p>
<p>So going through everything that&rsquo;s happened so far, the real thing that kind of like fucked</p>
<p>with me was my sense of safety in society and life.</p>
<p>Like the whole structure of society was crumbled beneath my eyes from what I was experiencing,</p>
<p>and hopelessness, fear, panic, all of it set in because I realized how truly broken the</p>
<p>system is, and how weak it is, and how everything in life is actually so fragile.</p>
<p>And to make the powerlessness worse, when I was going through all this, I started seeing</p>
<p>therapists and counselors, and I was trying to go to anyone I could go to for help.</p>
<p>No one could help me.</p>
<p>No one knew what to tell me.</p>
<p>No one had shit that they can do.</p>
<p>I was going to attorneys to try and help me with the legal shit, I was going to therapists</p>
<p>trying to help me with like my feelings, my emotions, my fucking depression, everything</p>
<p>that was in me.</p>
<p>No one could help me with it.</p>
<p>People literally looked me in my fucking face and said, I don&rsquo;t know what to tell you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I can&rsquo;t help you.</p>
<p>You know how many times I had to hear that before I just said fuck it, and stopped going</p>
<p>to see people, and stopped asking for help?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the type to ask for help, never have been, but I was put in a position where I</p>
<p>finally had to, and I couldn&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>You want to talk about hopelessness?</p>
<p>There it is.</p>
<p>So then I started reading books, and researching online, and trying to find any fucking self-help</p>
<p>guru that had any explanation, or could help me at all with what I was feeling or dealing</p>
<p>with.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t find anything.</p>
<p>Certain little things would help with certain areas.</p>
<p>Someone who was very influential to me and helped me a lot was Teal Swan.</p>
<p>I love that bitch to death, I don&rsquo;t give a fuck what people say about her, I don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>if she is a cult leader or not, consider me in the cult, bitch.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not a cult leader.</p>
<p>A lot of people are just dumb as fuck, and don&rsquo;t know how to think for themselves.</p>
<p>But her content really helped me a lot, and I will promote her for the rest of my fucking</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>She helped me through a lot, just by sharing the things that she knows and she&rsquo;s been through.</p>
<p>But really nothing fucking fully helped.</p>
<p>Like even with her shit I was still kinda confused, very confused.</p>
<p>No book helped, no coach helped, no nothing.</p>
<p>Everything was fucking worthless.</p>
<p>And on top of that, this was my breaking point.</p>
<p>This piece of shit ex I fucking had prevented any move I made.</p>
<p>Everything in my life was prevented, destroyed, and fucked with.</p>
<p>Every day I woke up, a new area of my life was being taken away.</p>
<p>And it was so hard to wake up certain days, and just get out of the bed.</p>
<p>And there were so many nights that I would just like, hope I didn&rsquo;t fucking wake up.</p>
<p>Cause I wasn&rsquo;t at the point where I was ready to take my own life yet, but I was literally</p>
<p>sitting in bed like, if I didn&rsquo;t wake up tomorrow, I&rsquo;d kinda be fucking happy about it.</p>
<p>But with my life being attacked the way that it was, any potential I felt like I saw for</p>
<p>my life.</p>
<p>From a young age I always felt like I had a lot of potential, and I had a lot to share,</p>
<p>and I was gonna accomplish a lot.</p>
<p>And I had a really big heartbreak with that, because this ex of mine ruined any potential</p>
<p>that I had.</p>
<p>And I felt like my life was over, and was done for.</p>
<p>Like I saw no way out.</p>
<p>My life was so fucked up and destroyed, anything I worked for was taken away, was gone, was</p>
<p>ruined.</p>
<p>I did everything right my whole fucking life, and for it to just be taken away like that?</p>
<p>Imagine where I was.</p>
<p>Imagine where I was mentally.</p>
<p>But this is when I started coping with my life, because living was just too fucking</p>
<p>painful.</p>
<p>Like to wake up every day and your life just to be fucked with an attack, and for your</p>
<p>life to be fucking toyed with?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not fun.</p>
<p>Like if there&rsquo;s no way to defend yourself and protect yourself, waking up is not fun.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a fair fucking fight.</p>
<p>I love a fair fight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fighter bitch, I&rsquo;ll fight 10 on 1 as long as I got a knife, I don&rsquo;t give a fuck.</p>
<p>But when there&rsquo;s such a disadvantage of like where your hands are basically tied behind</p>
<p>your back and someone&rsquo;s just kicking you in your fucking face, that&rsquo;s not a fair fight</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not fun.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how I felt like my life was, every day waking up.</p>
<p>Who the fuck would want to wake up from that?</p>
<p>Nobody.</p>
<p>But the real thing that I had to cope with was feeling like the potential for my life</p>
<p>was gone.</p>
<p>Like everything I had ever hoped to do, or everything I dreamed about, or like even hoped</p>
<p>for, my brain couldn&rsquo;t even hope for it anymore.</p>
<p>My brain couldn&rsquo;t even think of these things because there was no possibility of it.</p>
<p>Like the way my life was, there was no way out.</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t even entertain like positive thoughts or happy things because they just</p>
<p>were so far out of reach and I knew they were inaccessible.</p>
<p>Like for me to think about the potential for my life, it was gone.</p>
<p>It was over.</p>
<p>It was wiped out.</p>
<p>Like the little kid in me that felt all this potential and knew how much he had to give,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t do anything with him.</p>
<p>I literally didn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>There was no way for him to express it.</p>
<p>Like there was no way for me to ever tap into that potential with the way that my life was.</p>
<p>So when I talk about hopelessness, motherfucker, I&rsquo;m talking about it.</p>
<p>And this is when I started coping with my life because there was no way out.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see a way out.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see a way through.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see a point.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see why to keep going.</p>
<p>Like I had experienced enough.</p>
<p>I had seen too much, I felt.</p>
<p>And I was like, what the fuck is even the goddamn point?</p>
<p>Every day I wake up, it&rsquo;s some more bullshit that I can&rsquo;t protect myself from.</p>
<p>What the fuck is going on?</p>
<p>So I started doing drugs.</p>
<p>I started drinking.</p>
<p>I started getting blacked out, fucking drunk as often as I could.</p>
<p>I was rolling my ass off on molly.</p>
<p>I never did no ugly drug.</p>
<p>I never did meth or anything weird like that.</p>
<p>I never did like a trashy drug, but I did do molly as fuck and ecstasy.</p>
<p>I used to love an ecstasy and love a molly just because I got to feel good for a goddamn</p>
<p>second.</p>
<p>But then the comedown would hit, but my life was already so fucking bad.</p>
<p>This is the thing.</p>
<p>You have a very bad comedown when you do MDMA.</p>
<p>And my life was so bad.</p>
<p>And the way I felt normally was the level of a comedown that I didn&rsquo;t even know that</p>
<p>you had comedowns from drugs.</p>
<p>And so my life got better and I tried them again.</p>
<p>And I was like, why do I feel like I want to fucking die for three days?</p>
<p>Having to fucking die was my sense of normal.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t understand that there was a comedown with drugs, so I just kept doing them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I was at.</p>
<p>And I was never addicted to anything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one thing I will say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always just been stubborn.</p>
<p>Like I was like, I&rsquo;m not going to get addicted to shit.</p>
<p>But I was abusing the fuck out of some drugs and drinking.</p>
<p>Like my poor Czech liver light was on.</p>
<p>But in this stage, I really didn&rsquo;t give a fuck if I woke up.</p>
<p>I really was like, not hoping I didn&rsquo;t wake up, but I really was just like, eh, it would</p>
<p>make things a lot easier.</p>
<p>And I was taking a lot of drugs and I knew what I was taking and the amount that I was</p>
<p>taking.</p>
<p>And I was like, if I die, I die.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>And there was a lot of nights that I just did a lot of stupid shit and I was so careless</p>
<p>with my life because I didn&rsquo;t see it as something worth protecting anymore.</p>
<p>My life potential was gone.</p>
<p>So I was just like stripped bare naked feeling like, what the fuck is the point?</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m just going to be careless and just risk anything I fucking want.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing to risk anymore.</p>
<p>I just did absolutely anything I wanted.</p>
<p>I did some crazy ass shit.</p>
<p>But I did get to a point where I had to like reel in the partying and drinking so much</p>
<p>because I was in court with this motherfucker and I was having to represent myself.</p>
<p>I was my own goddamn attorney because I didn&rsquo;t have money to pay for one.</p>
<p>So I had to like calm down on the party and calm down on the drinking to study law, practice,</p>
<p>prepare and then go represent myself in fucking court.</p>
<p>So when I would get off the drugs and when I would stop drinking, it was very hard because</p>
<p>that like heartbreak for the potential that I felt for my life came through and I got</p>
<p>to quiet it with substances, but like it never went away.</p>
<p>And when I wasn&rsquo;t on anything, the potential that I felt so heartbroken over that I was</p>
<p>never going to get a chance to meet was there.</p>
<p>And I just felt like the little kid in me, like I had to just like tell him no, like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>Like I know how much love you have to give.</p>
<p>I know what you want to share.</p>
<p>I know what you can do.</p>
<p>You see it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve always wished for it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve always hoped for it.</p>
<p>But no, you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And there was nothing I could do to protect him.</p>
<p>There was nothing I could do to protect myself.</p>
<p>And this broke the fuck out of my heart.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve been through a lot of heartbreak.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been through the biggest betrayals you could think of, family, friends, anyone.</p>
<p>Heartbreak is nothing fucking new to me.</p>
<p>But the biggest heartbreak I ever experienced, I think was that like with my little self,</p>
<p>like anytime my little self is involved, that&rsquo;s my biggest heartbreak.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll fucking lose my mind over.</p>
<p>And I literally was just thinking like, I see the innocence and like the potential that</p>
<p>I have and what I want to give to this fucking world.</p>
<p>And how the fuck could this shit be happening to me?</p>
<p>Like karma went out the fucking window.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in fucking karma because I&rsquo;ve never in my life done shit to deserve</p>
<p>what the fuck I&rsquo;ve been through.</p>
<p>So karma can eat a fucking dick.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I still have so much resentment and I turned my fucking back on God.</p>
<p>I literally turned my back on God.</p>
<p>I turned my back on the universe because I was like, this makes no sense.</p>
<p>I know my fucking heart.</p>
<p>I know how I&rsquo;ve never done people wrong.</p>
<p>And for this fucking shit to be happening to me, everything in this life, everything</p>
<p>in this universe can eat my fucking dick.</p>
<p>And that anger didn&rsquo;t come so quick because I literally got to a place of desperation</p>
<p>where I was like praying for anything, like praying to anything out there.</p>
<p>Like I was literally praying to God.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>I prayed to the universe.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>I prayed to the fucking devil to help me.</p>
<p>Take anything you fucking want.</p>
<p>Nothing came.</p>
<p>Nothing happened.</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all asked why I&rsquo;m not religious.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>Girl, I got into voodoo too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Marie Laveau, Baba Legba, motherfucker.</p>
<p>Maybe I could find a supernatural spirituality, witchcraft, anything you can fucking think</p>
<p>of.</p>
<p>I tried it.</p>
<p>I fucking tried it.</p>
<p>And when nothing worked, that feeling of powerlessness and hopelessness and never feeling looked</p>
<p>after or like someone was there for me or feeling safe was there again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had that run in too many fucking times, but that was like a breaking point.</p>
<p>So all my beliefs, all my hopes, all my thoughts, everything shattered, gone, wiped out.</p>
<p>And at this point, I was just so fucking mad about my little self, like the potential</p>
<p>that I always have felt and the dreams that I had when I was little for all those to just</p>
<p>be taken away from some piece of fucking shit who can&rsquo;t control his fucking emotions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to try and ruin me because you&rsquo;re a fucking little shit.</p>
<p>I was so mad and I had nothing to lose.</p>
<p>And my Albanian came out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a spiteful fuck.</p>
<p>I am one of the biggest hearts and one of the most caring people.</p>
<p>I will do anything for you, but if you hurt me or you cross me, I will do anything to</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of the most mean and hateful fucking people you will ever meet in your life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s duality in everything.</p>
<p>As much as I can love is as much as I can hate.</p>
<p>And I was looking at my life like if my life is ruined and the potential is gone, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to cost you, bitch.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to take out what I feel inside of me and prevent that and ruin that, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not just fucking sitting down and taking it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking shit into my own hands.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t care if I lived or died anymore.</p>
<p>Living, there was literally no future to live for.</p>
<p>My current life at that time, what the fuck was that shit?</p>
<p>I did not care.</p>
<p>Death felt like a fucking relief.</p>
<p>All I was experiencing was pain.</p>
<p>There was no hope.</p>
<p>There was no good feelings.</p>
<p>There was no nothing in life.</p>
<p>Even the molly didn&rsquo;t fucking make me feel good anymore.</p>
<p>My life was just pain.</p>
<p>And I saw no way out.</p>
<p>So then I started weighing my options.</p>
<p>I was looking at my life like it was over.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s just like this pit of fucking pain that I can&rsquo;t escape.</p>
<p>So I can choose to keep living that or I can end this motherfucker how I want to.</p>
<p>I had tried fucking everything to fix my life and help myself.</p>
<p>Nothing worked.</p>
<p>And I felt so fucking powerless to the pain that I was feeling and what was happening</p>
<p>to my life.</p>
<p>Like, internally, the pain I was feeling, plus externally, like the shit that was going</p>
<p>on.</p>
<p>I felt so powerless to it.</p>
<p>I made a plan.</p>
<p>And I made a plan for what it was going to cost for ruining my life.</p>
<p>I was going to get my fucking get back on every single person who has ever fucking hurt</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>Like I said, the Albanian came out.</p>
<p>So I was very logical and very calculated about my plan for how I was going to go about</p>
<p>a mass fucking murder spree and then a suicide to follow it off because I&rsquo;m not getting away</p>
<p>with it.</p>
<p>The amount of people I was going to get, there was no getting away with it.</p>
<p>There was a paper trail.</p>
<p>There was too much shit going on.</p>
<p>And I was looking at it like my life is already over.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s make it worth something.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to try and fuck up my life, if you&rsquo;re going to take away my life, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to pay the cost.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to cost you yours and every single thing you love in this fucking world.</p>
<p>So my plan was I was going to mutilate my ex.</p>
<p>I was going to cut his arms and legs off at the elbows because I still wanted to have</p>
<p>some nubs arms and legs at the knees and elbows.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to turn him into a full nugget.</p>
<p>I wanted to just mutilate the fuck out of him.</p>
<p>And I have the medical background to do it.</p>
<p>And I have the connections in the medical field to do it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m friends with a lot of doctors and surgeons.</p>
<p>And at that time, they all knew what I was going through and they were all on board to</p>
<p>help me because the shit that I was going through, dude, no one fucking deserves that.</p>
<p>And as good as I was to this person, I didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong.</p>
<p>If I did something wrong, I&rsquo;d fucking own it.</p>
<p>But the way shit was, I felt good about that.</p>
<p>I feel like that&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>And then I was going to take away everything he ever loved.</p>
<p>So anyone that he cared about, I was going to kill them.</p>
<p>And then any pet he had, any pet that he knew or anything that brought him joy, I was going</p>
<p>to take it.</p>
<p>And then I had a long list of all the people from my past, from high school and all my</p>
<p>bullies that I had.</p>
<p>And just people that really pissed me off.</p>
<p>Like this one lady in nursing school was just a raging fucking cunt.</p>
<p>So I was going to take her out too before I went.</p>
<p>I concocted this full plan of how I was going to get justification for my life actually</p>
<p>being over.</p>
<p>But I was going to mutilate my ex first because I wanted him to live.</p>
<p>I know how to mutilate someone to keep them alive.</p>
<p>I wanted to keep him alive.</p>
<p>This is all a theory too.</p>
<p>Let me just go ahead and say that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any plans of doing this.</p>
<p>This never happened.</p>
<p>This just was my plan.</p>
<p>And like I said, there&rsquo;s no plan to execute it.</p>
<p>And this is not a threat for any attorney who wants to watch this video suck my dick.</p>
<p>But basically I wanted to keep my ex alive.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to kill him.</p>
<p>This is too easy.</p>
<p>I wanted him to suffer.</p>
<p>I wanted all of the pain I was feeling to be transferred to him.</p>
<p>I wanted him to feel the powerlessness, the hopelessness, the dread, the despair, and</p>
<p>the fucking loneliness that I felt.</p>
<p>Because when you&rsquo;re going through shit like this, there&rsquo;s no one to fucking relate to.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t talk to nobody about this shit.</p>
<p>Nobody got it.</p>
<p>Nobody could relate to me.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t go nowhere.</p>
<p>I felt so fucking alone.</p>
<p>Like more alone than I ever felt in my life.</p>
<p>And I wanted to transfer that to him because he fucking caused that shit.</p>
<p>There was a lot from my past that he didn&rsquo;t cause, but he just caused so much of it.</p>
<p>I was like, I&rsquo;m going to throw it all on you, you little shit.</p>
<p>You want to fucking take my life?</p>
<p>Watch what I do to yours.</p>
<p>So I wanted to keep him alive, but with no arms and legs.</p>
<p>So his day-to-day life is hell, like mine was.</p>
<p>And then I was going to take everything that he ever loved and cared about.</p>
<p>And just so he felt that sense of loneliness and pain, and he couldn&rsquo;t kill himself because</p>
<p>you have no fucking hands.</p>
<p>I want you to fucking sit there and endure it.</p>
<p>I wanted my life to be worth taking.</p>
<p>Like if you were going to ruin the potential for my life, you were going to sit there and</p>
<p>deal with the consequences.</p>
<p>Because I know what I&rsquo;ve felt inside myself for so long, I literally was like, it&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>much for a little price.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re paying a big one.</p>
<p>And like I said, death was too easy.</p>
<p>I wanted a life of suffering because that&rsquo;s what I was subjected to.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s only fair.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only fair.</p>
<p>You want to talk about fair?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about it.</p>
<p>You want to talk about God and how I&rsquo;m going to go to hell?</p>
<p>Eat my dick.</p>
<p>That shit ain&rsquo;t real.</p>
<p>But like I said, after all that, I planned on just killing myself because the potential</p>
<p>for my life was over anyway.</p>
<p>So I would rather choose to go out the way that I wanted to go out and end the suffering</p>
<p>than just endure the suffering and be tormented the rest of my life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not fun.</p>
<p>And the most fucked up part of this situation is I was fully ready to do it so many times.</p>
<p>And I was going to do it a couple of times.</p>
<p>And I know I&rsquo;m fully capable of it.</p>
<p>You guys don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m actually capable of.</p>
<p>And a lot of people would hear this and be like, oh yeah, you&rsquo;re full of shit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many things that I&rsquo;ve done and things that people don&rsquo;t know about my capabilities</p>
<p>and what I&rsquo;m able to do.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d rather leave it that way.</p>
<p>But this plan was not something that was to be taken easy.</p>
<p>Like this is the only thing that ever made me feel better about what I was going through.</p>
<p>I felt so powerless to do anything.</p>
<p>And making that plan, I knew I could do it.</p>
<p>And I knew I&rsquo;d execute it.</p>
<p>And that is the only thing that brought me relief and brought me a little bit of peace</p>
<p>knowing I was going to get some kind of get back.</p>
<p>I was going to get some kind of justification.</p>
<p>I was going to be able to do something.</p>
<p>And the motherfucker knew I&rsquo;m insane because he kept fleeing the country.</p>
<p>But as soon as it at last landed back, I knew where he was.</p>
<p>Making that plan released so much resistance in me because I felt so free.</p>
<p>I felt so trapped, but I felt so free finally.</p>
<p>Like I knew what I was going to do.</p>
<p>I felt okay with it.</p>
<p>And I was like, now it&rsquo;s just a matter of like, when do I want to do it?</p>
<p>So I was like, fuck it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to enjoy life a little bit.</p>
<p>Like even though all this shit&rsquo;s happening, I didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have to think of the future anymore.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have to think of like, what are the consequences going to be if I go do.</p>
<p>XYZ that I want to try.</p>
<p>I was free to take risks.</p>
<p>I was free to gamble.</p>
<p>I was free to live every day, day to day and just see what the fuck I could do.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t give a fuck.</p>
<p>I was in court anymore.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I literally was just like, I&rsquo;ll go kill everybody when I&rsquo;m ready and then kill myself.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, let&rsquo;s have some fun.</p>
<p>And I was only able to start enjoying my life or like anything I could about life because</p>
<p>I knew I had an end to my suffering coming.</p>
<p>So making that list really fucking saved my ass.</p>
<p>Like it really, really did for so many reasons.</p>
<p>And it like brought back so many feeling states that I couldn&rsquo;t access.</p>
<p>Like I finally got like a little sense like, okay, this isn&rsquo;t too bad, but it wasn&rsquo;t long.</p>
<p>It was just like, okay, the next couple of days will be nice until I do this.</p>
<p>So I was just like happy again for a minute, but I knew it was going to end and I knew</p>
<p>it was going to go away.</p>
<p>So I was like, fuck it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just be happy for a couple of days.</p>
<p>So like for the next few days after I made my plan, I was just running around life like</p>
<p>I gave a fuck.</p>
<p>Like I was literally just like balls to the wind, didn&rsquo;t give a fuck.</p>
<p>I was literally just being reckless.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t give a fuck about shit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m dying.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t give a fuck.</p>
<p>I was just doing anything I wanted to do.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to talk about law of attraction a little bit because the universe shit is</p>
<p>real.</p>
<p>Like as much as I want to say, fuck you to the universe, it is real.</p>
<p>Making that list of what I plan to do allowed me to release so much resistance that I was</p>
<p>a match to higher feeling states and like higher level thoughts.</p>
<p>And I had the idea to start my app Positive Focus two days after I made the murder suicide</p>
<p>plan.</p>
<p>And I was like, hey, that could be fun.</p>
<p>Like I loved the idea of going through so much shit and then making an app that would</p>
<p>like truly help people and then dying.</p>
<p>Like ah, I don&rsquo;t know why I got off on that.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s so me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so me to do.</p>
<p>Like make this app like I wanted it to like blow up immediately.</p>
<p>Like I was hoping it would like blow the fuck up.</p>
<p>Everybody would love it.</p>
<p>And then I would die.</p>
<p>Like go on my little murder spree and then kill myself.</p>
<p>Like I just felt like that was like so cool.</p>
<p>And I was like obsessed with that idea.</p>
<p>So I was like, fuck it.</p>
<p>Like I already have my plan to execute this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make a little app before I go, you know?</p>
<p>So like I said, I didn&rsquo;t give a fuck what I was dealing with day to day.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t thinking toward the future.</p>
<p>I knew I was going to make this little app and I was like, okay.</p>
<p>But I couldn&rsquo;t think past like a month&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>First it was like every day I was living day to day and it like was fun.</p>
<p>And then I was like, okay, the idea for the app.</p>
<p>So I was thinking like I could only think a month out in advance of like my future because</p>
<p>I it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s ending.</p>
<p>Like my life was ending and I knew it.</p>
<p>It was just a matter of like, when can I get this app out?</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m going to go execute everything because it&rsquo;s nothing&rsquo;s stopping at this point.</p>
<p>All the torment is still going on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just finding a way to like fuck around in between executing my plan.</p>
<p>But telling myself that I would start the app and then die was kind of like a bitch</p>
<p>because it made me stick around.</p>
<p>And there were certain days where I was like, man, fuck it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just go do this.</p>
<p>Cause like he was doing so much shit to me.</p>
<p>I was like so tempted so many times should just like execute my plan.</p>
<p>But I was like, no, Leo, we&rsquo;re making the app and then we&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>Like to make the app and like, oh, then die.</p>
<p>I was so obsessed with that idea.</p>
<p>Still kind of am.</p>
<p>So as I&rsquo;m in the process of making my app and doing all that, I&rsquo;m still being fucked</p>
<p>with.</p>
<p>My life is still fucking awful, but I&rsquo;m still just kind of like fucking around.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m back drinking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m back drugging.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just doing my shit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about court.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about a fuck thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like going about life, making my little app and I&rsquo;m ready to die.</p>
<p>Like I know that I&rsquo;m making it sound lighthearted, but I was just ready to go.</p>
<p>Like I was like, this is not letting up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not getting better.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m just excited for this app to be done so I can finally fucking escape this shit</p>
<p>because you can only cope and like have fun with life for so long when there&rsquo;s no future.</p>
<p>So the thing that brought me relief was like, oh, I&rsquo;ll just enjoy myself while I can.</p>
<p>And it was just getting a little too long.</p>
<p>And I was like, let&rsquo;s wrap this bitch the fuck up because what I&rsquo;m experiencing is too</p>
<p>painful.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, get this app out.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Cause I have fucking shit to do.</p>
<p>Let me let me be done with this.</p>
<p>And in the process of waiting for my app to be finished, I was trying new things to</p>
<p>get this motherfucker to stop ruining my life.</p>
<p>And they worked.</p>
<p>All of the torment stopped.</p>
<p>Oh, and reliving like this feeling state is a lot because like I was so ready to go and</p>
<p>like execute on my plan because of what I was going through and everything stopped and</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what the fuck to do.</p>
<p>My plan was no longer going to have to be executed.</p>
<p>I was no longer going to have to die.</p>
<p>So I was just so like, what the fuck?</p>
<p>Like literally what the hell just happened?</p>
<p>I literally had it all figured out.</p>
<p>I got the relief from having to think about life and think about a future and deal with</p>
<p>all this bullshit.</p>
<p>I just got to like live for a minute.</p>
<p>And I got used to living so careless with my life and not having, not throwing any caution</p>
<p>to the wind and just doing whatever the fuck I wanted because I was in so much pain.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>And I knew it was going to end.</p>
<p>And for everything to just stop, like physically that was going on with my life, it was like</p>
<p>all the damage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally like a fucking war zone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;ve been at war.</p>
<p>Your whole city is destroyed and you finally kill the last person on the opposing team.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;ve just been fighting for years.</p>
<p>Everything about your life is ruined.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re covered in all these fucking wounds.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s like fucked up and the war&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>What the fuck am I supposed to do now is what I thought.</p>
<p>Like how the hell am I supposed to go back to living life normally after this?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m literally getting chills talking about this shit.</p>
<p>But like that was the biggest mindfuck I&rsquo;ve ever experienced.</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>For so long I was living life where death was my safety net and I didn&rsquo;t have to care</p>
<p>about anything.</p>
<p>That sense of safety that I talked about that I felt with Josh, I felt that in death.</p>
<p>Like I used death as a safety net.</p>
<p>Everything I was worried about trying or doing, I was like fuck it, if it gets bad</p>
<p>enough I&rsquo;ll kill myself.</p>
<p>Who cares?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just go with my plan, take everybody out, and then kill myself.</p>
<p>Like I just got to live life so carefree and not have to take anything into consideration</p>
<p>and just do whatever the fuck I wanted to do.</p>
<p>And the thing that was causing me to live like that just stopped.</p>
<p>And I was so lost.</p>
<p>Because how the fuck are you supposed to just flip back into living normal and caring about</p>
<p>your future and like trying to clean up the fucking mess that&rsquo;s been made?</p>
<p>Like I said, it&rsquo;s like going to war and it&rsquo;s over and you&rsquo;re literally just standing there</p>
<p>in all the rubble like, what the fuck now?</p>
<p>What the fuck life do I even have left?</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>That stopped.</p>
<p>But the damage is still done.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much irreparable fucking damage to my life, to my emotions, to my mental state,</p>
<p>to my fucking reality, to even being alive.</p>
<p>How the fuck am I supposed to even take one step forward and keep going?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never felt more lost in my life because I felt too fucked up.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when the next level of hopelessness set in.</p>
<p>So like everything that was happening to my life made me want to die, to escape it.</p>
<p>When everything was gone and the war was over, the thing that made me want to leave now was</p>
<p>like, there&rsquo;s really no point in going forward.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s just too much damage.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m too fucked up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been very, very aware and I&rsquo;ve always just known shit I&rsquo;m not supposed to</p>
<p>know.</p>
<p>I understand everything at a level that most people can&rsquo;t get to.</p>
<p>You guys know you listen to my fucking podcast, but I was aware how fucked up I was.</p>
<p>I was aware how bad everything in my life had fucked with me at this point, especially</p>
<p>this giant situation.</p>
<p>Like I knew how fucked up I was.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, the thing I can relate it to is it&rsquo;s like being fully covered in third degree</p>
<p>burns all over your fucking body.</p>
<p>All your skin is melted off.</p>
<p>And now you want me to go walk around life and try and go function?</p>
<p>What the literal fuck is that?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one big thing about trauma is like, it&rsquo;s so unfair to have to go back and be expected</p>
<p>to function and live life after you&rsquo;ve been traumatized in a very, very bad way.</p>
<p>Like I said, I had dealt with betrayal before.</p>
<p>I had dealt with heartbreak before, but this level of heartbreak tarnished any hope I had</p>
<p>for anything or anyone.</p>
<p>How the fuck was I supposed to go forward and trust another human being again?</p>
<p>I literally saw the worst of the world.</p>
<p>I saw the worst of everything.</p>
<p>I saw the darkest shit, felt the darkest shit, and I saw how truly fragile everything is.</p>
<p>I saw like reality, and it&rsquo;s not nice.</p>
<p>The reality of this fucking life and this world, I was only exposed to the bad part</p>
<p>of it.</p>
<p>It took me a while to practice seeing the good side of it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happened now.</p>
<p>But I saw all of the bad, everything fucking bad.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so much worse than you can ever fucking imagine.</p>
<p>And the things that you feel when you see it, oh my god.</p>
<p>But understanding the truth about life now, all the true dangers, all the real shit to</p>
<p>be scared of, all the real shit that you can feel, and all the real darkness that&rsquo;s out</p>
<p>there, I was scared to commit to life again.</p>
<p>Why the fuck would I want to continue life like that?</p>
<p>Now I see everything for what it is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no more illusion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no more false sense of safety and false sense of anything.</p>
<p>My eyes were ripped the fuck open.</p>
<p>And I saw everything for what it was.</p>
<p>I saw all the real pain that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>In what logical fucking world would you want to go into life?</p>
<p>Where would you want to recommit to life again?</p>
<p>Because I was on the fence for a while.</p>
<p>I was on the fence with like, am I living, am I dying?</p>
<p>I was more committed to dying in the way that I wanted to go out.</p>
<p>But now I was at a standstill of like, I can choose to commit to death and kill myself,</p>
<p>which I didn&rsquo;t really want to.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t really like worth it anymore.</p>
<p>Like for me to just like kill myself, I was like, no, I like to go out with a bang.</p>
<p>But on the flip side, to commit to going through life and like trying to repair all the damage</p>
<p>that had been caused, oh, I felt too fucked up.</p>
<p>I felt like it was just too far gone.</p>
<p>I felt like I was too far gone.</p>
<p>Everything that had happened to me, everything that I had seen, I literally was like, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no point.</p>
<p>There is not like, I understand what I have to do.</p>
<p>Going through all of this taught me all of the ways to handle shit and taught me all</p>
<p>of the answers I couldn&rsquo;t find.</p>
<p>I found all of the answers I was looking for in the fucking bottom of my suffering.</p>
<p>And all the shit I couldn&rsquo;t find, I now knew.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m so fucking aware.</p>
<p>I knew what it would take to heal myself.</p>
<p>And I knew what I had to do.</p>
<p>I was just like, for what?</p>
<p>I just saw life for what is actually in it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the point?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one reason I do not like for people to look into my eyes too long.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like when people hold eye contact with me because I&rsquo;m scared of what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna see.</p>
<p>Because the shit that I&rsquo;ve seen, I don&rsquo;t want anyone to see it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want anyone to experience what I&rsquo;ve experienced.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I just feel like your eyes are like a vessel.</p>
<p>And I feel like whenever I look into someone&rsquo;s eyes, I have this thing where I can like,</p>
<p>see shit.</p>
<p>And like, I feel things.</p>
<p>And like, I don&rsquo;t want anyone to ever tap into me like that.</p>
<p>Because of what the fuck you&rsquo;re gonna see.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like people looking into my eyes too long.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want them to see the darkness that I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>And I do not want them to see what I&rsquo;m capable of.</p>
<p>Because getting to the places I&rsquo;ve been to, it would scare the fuck out of you.</p>
<p>Like anyone.</p>
<p>It would fucking terrify you.</p>
<p>It terrifies me sometimes.</p>
<p>So at this point with feeling like I was just too far gone, I really was just ready to go.</p>
<p>And I wasn&rsquo;t mad anymore.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t angry.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sad.</p>
<p>I just kind of like, accepted it.</p>
<p>And I was like, this is what life is.</p>
<p>And if this is what my path is gonna be, I&rsquo;m ready to go.</p>
<p>I saw no hope.</p>
<p>I saw no anything.</p>
<p>Nothing good coming out of my life.</p>
<p>I saw nothing good left from my life.</p>
<p>And I really just like, made peace with it.</p>
<p>I was like, I&rsquo;m ready to go.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Like it was a very calm decision.</p>
<p>And it was not an emotionally charged one.</p>
<p>And I was at peace with it.</p>
<p>And literally 30 seconds after I decided that in myself, my sister walked into my room.</p>
<p>And she saw this post online.</p>
<p>And it said, if you found out you were gonna die tomorrow, what is something you&rsquo;d regret</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t do?</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t think of anything.</p>
<p>And that made me really fucking sad.</p>
<p>Like it genuinely made me so fucking sad to think like, how at peace I was with it.</p>
<p>Like if I did find out I was dying tomorrow, that there was nothing that I regretted not</p>
<p>doing.</p>
<p>One thing that did come to mind was, I&rsquo;ve always wanted to go into like an open field</p>
<p>and just run.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>Like, you know when you&rsquo;re like driving down like some countryside, and it&rsquo;s like just</p>
<p>a bunch of land, like as far as you can see, and like the sun is setting, I&rsquo;ve just always</p>
<p>just wanted to like pull a car over and like just take off fucking running.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That was like the one regret I had and I literally was like, okay, so I can do that tomorrow.</p>
<p>And then what?</p>
<p>Like I really had no other regret that I didn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>And I wasn&rsquo;t scared at how at peace I was with wanting to like just go.</p>
<p>And after my sister left my room, I kind of was just like sitting in my bed thinking.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden I started feeling very, very guilty.</p>
<p>And I was like, why the fuck am I all of a sudden feeling guilty?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just so at peace over here, ready to die.</p>
<p>What the fuck is this guilt all of a sudden?</p>
<p>And emotions are messengers.</p>
<p>And I always preach that.</p>
<p>And I always say that because it&rsquo;s the fucking truth.</p>
<p>And I was like, okay, what the fuck is this guilt trying to make me aware of?</p>
<p>And the fucking guilt was everything that I had been through gave me all of the answers</p>
<p>I needed to end my suffering.</p>
<p>And if I was back in a position like I was before, I know exactly how to handle it.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t suffer like I did before.</p>
<p>Like I know what true ways out of shit and the ways to deal with yourself and deal with</p>
<p>situations.</p>
<p>And all the answers I looked for that I couldn&rsquo;t find, I now had.</p>
<p>And the guilt that I felt was after I died.</p>
<p>It was like a guilt for like after death of like, I would feel so guilty to have died</p>
<p>with all of this inside of me.</p>
<p>Like even if I was too far gone and too far damaged, I did know a lot of ways to help.</p>
<p>And I did have a lot of shit to share.</p>
<p>And I was like, why am I feeling like guilt after I&rsquo;ve already died?</p>
<p>I was like, is my soul trying to fucking talk to me?</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>Now you all of a sudden want to fucking communicate, bitch, where were you?</p>
<p>But this overwhelming guilt of like dying with all the things I found inside of me without</p>
<p>like sharing it or giving it to someone else really fucked with me.</p>
<p>I literally was like, even if I&rsquo;m too far damaged, I can help a lot of people.</p>
<p>And then my pissed off side came out.</p>
<p>My little hurt side was like, you know what?</p>
<p>Fuck that.</p>
<p>What do I get out of sharing that shit?</p>
<p>Who fucking helped me when I was suffering?</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Nobody.</p>
<p>So why the fuck would I give you all the answers to it?</p>
<p>I was literally so mad.</p>
<p>And I was like, you know what feels actually better now is to fucking die with all this</p>
<p>shit trapped inside of me and everybody else can fucking suffer the way that I did.</p>
<p>And no one helped me enjoy, bitch, enjoy.</p>
<p>I was so fucking mad and so hurt.</p>
<p>And I was so just like, I want everyone to suffer the way that I fucking have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sharing shit.</p>
<p>I literally was like, fuck my soul.</p>
<p>Fuck God.</p>
<p>Fuck the universe.</p>
<p>Fuck everything.</p>
<p>Like y&rsquo;all did this to me.</p>
<p>And you think I&rsquo;m just gonna fucking freely just give it out out of the kindness of my</p>
<p>heart?</p>
<p>Eat shit.</p>
<p>Where was the kindness of everyone else&rsquo;s heart when I needed help?</p>
<p>But I was stuck in such a standstill because sure, I was pissed off and I was mad and I</p>
<p>wanted everyone to suffer just like I had because no one helped me and everybody was</p>
<p>hurting me.</p>
<p>So fuck everybody.</p>
<p>I was acting like that.</p>
<p>But then as soon as the emotional charge kind of like wore off, I really wanted to die without</p>
<p>sharing shit as like the biggest cosmic fuck you.</p>
<p>So whoever orchestrated this life, I&rsquo;m like in the hunger games, like the one that fucked</p>
<p>up the game.</p>
<p>Like, ha, I know you&rsquo;re supposed to share what you learned, but fuck you.</p>
<p>That was too unfair.</p>
<p>I genuinely got so much satisfaction out of thinking of dying with it all inside of me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like my ultimate revenge is to have everything everybody needs and to fucking</p>
<p>die with it and not share it.</p>
<p>Like from what I&rsquo;ve been through, I felt like that was justification.</p>
<p>Also that guilt I felt like the little, the little me that felt the potential his whole</p>
<p>life was like, you can&rsquo;t just fucking die with it in you asshole.</p>
<p>And that little kid that I felt and like the potential that I&rsquo;ve always felt was very clear.</p>
<p>And I was like, what the fuck do I do now?</p>
<p>And I was so torn because I just wanted to fucking die so bad out of spite.</p>
<p>And then I wanted to just take care of that little kid that everybody had hurt and like</p>
<p>make my life worth something.</p>
<p>But I just knew how much I had to clean up and fix.</p>
<p>I was like, sorry, kid.</p>
<p>Like I really don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>Can you just get on board with dying?</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not kidding.</p>
<p>I was at such a standstill and I had a decision to make.</p>
<p>And I really was like, am I going to die or am I going to not like I, I didn&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>to make the fucking decision.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a very extreme person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very dramatic.</p>
<p>So in Pensacola, Florida, where I lived at the time, there&rsquo;s a pier, it&rsquo;s like a quarter</p>
<p>mile long pier that goes out into the Gulf.</p>
<p>It goes out into the ocean and it&rsquo;s very, very high.</p>
<p>So one night, very late, I went out to the pier and I went to the end of it.</p>
<p>It was pitch black.</p>
<p>It was dead fucking silent.</p>
<p>There was no one around.</p>
<p>I literally had a discussion with myself, like I was fighting for both sides of me.</p>
<p>And I literally was like, how bad do you actually want to go?</p>
<p>Because if I&rsquo;m going to actually kill myself, it&rsquo;s not going to be on some pussy shit.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s going to be a cool way to go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to like be real cool.</p>
<p>When I wanted to test myself, like this angry part of me that was like wanting to just die</p>
<p>with everything inside of me.</p>
<p>I was talking to that part and was like, if you want to go so bad, I&rsquo;m not making it easy</p>
<p>on you.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re not going to get to just go like shoot yourself or go like take some fucking</p>
<p>drugs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a painful death.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re facing an easy death and you&rsquo;re like, yeah, it&rsquo;s worth it, let&rsquo;s die.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s different from, I want to die so bad I&rsquo;ll do anything to get out.</p>
<p>And the other part of me was like the one that wanted to fight for the little me and</p>
<p>was like, no, I want to share everything that I&rsquo;ve learned.</p>
<p>I literally was like, I couldn&rsquo;t come to a fucking decision in my head of what to do.</p>
<p>So I just got up on the fucking ledge of the pier and jumped.</p>
<p>When I fucking hit that water, I literally was like, what the fuck did you just do?</p>
<p>I was literally in the pitch dark middle of the fucking ocean getting jerked around by</p>
<p>waves like a bitch.</p>
<p>It was not calm that night.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, but I&rsquo;m over here just like literally like, like I&rsquo;m not swimming, but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like doing enough to keep my head above water.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m thinking to myself like, what the fuck did you just do?</p>
<p>And I literally was like, okay, if you want to die, swim out, let your body get exhaustion</p>
<p>and drown.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not getting an easy, peaceful way to die.</p>
<p>If you want to die, it&rsquo;s going to hurt because I really want to see how bad you want it.</p>
<p>Now, Leo, if you fucking swim out there and die, so be it, or you can swim your ass to</p>
<p>the shore.</p>
<p>But if you swim to the shore, you&rsquo;re going to honor the little part of you that wants</p>
<p>to share everything, and you&rsquo;re going to go fucking share it.</p>
