<p>into a salad so anyway it was a disaster</p>
<p>it clogged up the machine they had to</p>
<p>take the Machine apart four different</p>
<p>times and clean all the different parts</p>
<p>because apparently fractionate coconut</p>
<p>oil makes things really sticky so it</p>
<p>locked up the Pistons and it was it was</p>
<p>a washed so we had about 325 gallons of</p>
<p>liquid ice cream go down the drain so</p>
<p>now I know why there&rsquo;s not a lot of</p>
<p>companies if any that ever came out with</p>
<p>an ice cream that&rsquo;s less than one gram</p>
<p>of sugar simply because the sugar allows</p>
<p>for the consistency the texture the</p>
<p>melting points that doesn&rsquo;t turn into a</p>
<p>solid rock when you put it in the</p>
<p>freezer so anyway it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>chemistry project we&rsquo;re gonna we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna try it again because I have some</p>
<p>material left we&rsquo;re gonna try it again</p>
<p>this Tuesday so I&rsquo;ll let you know what</p>
<p>happens but you know you just got to try</p>
<p>it and keep trying until it works so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>back we&rsquo;re gonna answer your questions</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s start with Vanessa go ahead</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Orange County hi Vanessa</p>
<p>good morning doctor but especially I</p>
<p>just wanna show my appreciation you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been very helpful to me and others I</p>
<p>appreciate that very much</p>
<p>I before we following you three months</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing you know Jenni and intimate</p>
<p>laughs man I been taking some of your</p>
<p>products for my pre diabetic condition</p>
<p>that the reason why I contacted you the</p>
<p>beginning and so there&rsquo;s several</p>
<p>products I&rsquo;ve been taking and I do</p>
<p>couches a lot a lot of Dallas in my</p>
<p>entire life you have a Titan that much</p>
<p>and some in about a month ago I started</p>
<p>like difficulty walking up stairs and</p>
<p>getting up with my knee and then last</p>
<p>week I just had this terrible like Rambo</p>
<p>leg from cats all the way to the coast</p>
<p>that lasted forever</p>
<p>in like 10 15 minutes and it was very</p>
<p>very painful never had that before once</p>
<p>in a while when try on leave it&rsquo;s not to</p>
<p>end up expensive of our team and then I</p>
<p>went to Annabelle that was 6 a.m. on</p>
<p>Saturday and then about 4 p.m. that same</p>
<p>day I had the emergency room so you</p>
<p>think you also have to relax right you</p>
<p>have the electrolytes you try that</p>
<p>instead yes I had a like July as well I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t allow couch shoes and eating 90%</p>
<p>of a thing you advise and so I thought I</p>
<p>should be better but my back and my POC</p>
<p>you are clueless people because it&rsquo;s 101</p>
<p>who they should hide ok so Vanessa</p>
<p>Vanessa all right so let me just tell</p>
<p>you what let&rsquo;s just focus on this one</p>
<p>issue here because I have a lot of</p>
<p>questions I want to get right to the</p>
<p>whole the main topic ok so this is a</p>
<p>very good point we&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>electrolytes normally that should handle</p>
<p>the cramps if it doesn&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m sort of</p>
<p>like potassium in the in the</p>
<p>electrolytes that normally should handle</p>
<p>it about 90% of the time if it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other minerals too that you can</p>
<p>use like calcium which is in the</p>
<p>electrolyte powder so if that didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>handle it</p>
<p>there are a couple other reasons why you</p>
<p>can have leg cramps</p>
<p>despite the mineral sign I just actually</p>
<p>I I created the video it didn&rsquo;t release</p>
<p>it yet but this has to do with the low</p>
<p>vitamin E vitamin E in a natural complex</p>
<p>normally increases the oxygen carrying</p>
<p>capacity to the muscle tissue and so if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re low in vitamin E you can even</p>
<p>have not just cramps in your muscles</p>
<p>generally you can have cramps in your</p>
<p>heart muscle called angina okay so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a heart cramp but you can also</p>
<p>have the lower legs so vitamin E is the</p>
<p>next step for you to test get a natural</p>
<p>vitamin E complex try taking that and it</p>
<p>that should work if it doesn&rsquo;t was one</p>
<p>more thing you can try and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>vitamin b1 vitamin b1 will also increase</p>
<p>heart rate and that&rsquo;s what you have</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll feel like your heart pounding a</p>
<p>little bit more heart rate it affects a</p>
<p>lot of issues especially if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pre-diabetic so you need more b1 b1 b1</p>
<p>is involved in the neurology the nerve</p>
<p>conduction velocity of a nerve it helps</p>
<p>prevent the loss of myelin on the</p>
<p>nervous system that&rsquo;s why I get</p>
<p>peripheral neuropathy if you&rsquo;re diabetic</p>
<p>so I would go with vitamin E and then or</p>
<p>b1 okay you can do nutritional yeast</p>
<p>but those are the two things I think</p>
<p>will fully handle your issues especially</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re kind of going on keto or</p>
<p>intermittent fasting if you have</p>
<p>problems because you need that you need</p>
<p>the potassium electrolytes and then you</p>
<p>need to be vitamins okay and then</p>
<p>sometimes vitamin E okay try that</p>
<p>Vanessa and let us know how it works</p>
<p>hey run you&rsquo;re from Los Angeles go ahead</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air run are you do hi good</p>
<p>how are you hello</p>
<p>okay a lot of questions ammonium</p>
<p>chloride yeah you talked about so I did</p>
<p>some burpees and my hands got real stiff</p>
<p>but I did a little bit too much oh I</p>
<p>bought bulk ammonium chloride so what is</p>
<p>the dose ditchin and what is the</p>
<p>duration that&rsquo;s a really good question</p>
<p>because when you buy in bulk sometimes</p>
<p>it could be</p>
<p>coming in and different they could be</p>
<p>using different units I would go back to</p>
<p>just look up the basic version of the</p>
<p>pill form and see what that comes into</p>
<p>is it 100 milligrams is the 50</p>
<p>milligrams whatever it is and then just</p>
<p>take out that much and use that I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really know of an exact dosage it&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of like an experimentation</p>
<p>I just basically use what&rsquo;s on the label</p>
<p>but when you took ammonium chloride you</p>
<p>have stiffness in the hands that is the</p>
<p>reason I I bought it I haven&rsquo;t tried it</p>
<p>yet okay you know I&rsquo;m thinking in terms</p>
<p>of like a quarter teaspoon or yeah I</p>
<p>think Dunning I think that&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>would start with sometimes it works</p>
<p>immediate sometimes it takes about two</p>
<p>or three days to kick in but what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to do it&rsquo;s going to start to</p>
<p>change your pH and help rid excess</p>
<p>calcium accumulation in the joints and</p>
<p>it really is wonderful for stiffness in</p>
<p>the hands and arthritis and inflammation</p>
<p>it was part of a as part of the extra</p>
<p>ingredient in some of the older</p>
<p>medications for arthritis and they took</p>
<p>it out and then the medication didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work so it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a real natural thing</p>
<p>that people can take called ammonium</p>
<p>chloride so go ahead and try that run</p>
<p>and thanks for your call hey didi you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from Costa Rica go ahead you have a</p>
<p>question oh yeah I have a question</p>
<p>because well I&rsquo;m here I came here for</p>
<p>three months just to basically wind down</p>
<p>from crazy life in New York City so I am</p>
<p>suffering was adrenal fatigue and I</p>
<p>pretty much have all symptoms that you</p>
<p>list and last winter they diagnosed me</p>
<p>me was a bronchial asked my even and</p>
<p>stuff like that and I basically said</p>
<p>okay there&rsquo;s something wrong and now I</p>
<p>found out that adrenals and so I am</p>
<p>taking adrenal fatigue supplement the</p>
<p>night formula pretty much most of the</p>
<p>supplements that you sell for these</p>
<p>issues</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t order the electrolyte powder I</p>
<p>actually</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know I needed because I am</p>
<p>actually on a limited fasting and keto</p>
<p>so I have a question regarding oldest</p>
<p>basically I am doing my program and I</p>
<p>have two things that have flared up I</p>
<p>have a say our sucide outbreak which I</p>
<p>usually have very I mean very seldom and</p>
<p>then I have pain on my left side of my</p>
<p>bellybutton and I&rsquo;m kind of looking it</p>
<p>up and I see that it is pancreas issue</p>
<p>probably and yeah and I&rsquo;m also taking</p>
<p>from a different online store I&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>also digestive and systemic enzymes that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking and I do take the cow blood</p>
<p>or formula okay um pretty much eat</p>
<p>salads all the time and some protein and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty much it okay alright let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>talk about that DD other than that how</p>
<p>you doing no it&rsquo;s going so here&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>couple things asthma and psoriasis have</p>
<p>a common denominator and yes you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s an adrenal insufficiency and</p>
<p>by the way I just want to make a</p>
<p>disclaimer on this show everything I say</p>
<p>is mainly for educational materials</p>
<p>check with your doctor before you take</p>
<p>any advice that I give you it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>meant to cure you or treat any type of</p>
<p>diseases okay alright that being said</p>
<p>asthma and psoriasis are definitely</p>
<p>adrenal issues because they treat them</p>
<p>with steroids adrenal that&rsquo;s adrenal</p>
<p>hormones cortisol but there is one</p>
<p>common thing and you&rsquo;re in Costa Rica so</p>
<p>you should be able to get this very</p>
<p>cheaply which is vitamin D getting a lot</p>
<p>of Sun vitamin D is one of the best</p>
<p>remedies for asthma and psoriasis for</p>
<p>the skin issues believe it or not so now</p>
<p>if let&rsquo;s say you can&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s not working</p>
<p>and then it could be a factor of not</p>
<p>digesting it and it could be that your</p>
<p>genomes are really kind of burnt out</p>
<p>that they need to kind of slowly come</p>
<p>back up so you&rsquo;re gonna have to I would</p>
<p>get lots of Sun I would I would get in</p>
<p>the salt water like in the ocean and get</p>
<p>that exposed to your scalp or wherever</p>
<p>the psoriasis is</p>
<p>the other thing too is bentonite clay if</p>
<p>you mix that with water bentonite clay</p>
<p>is the weathered ashes from the volcano</p>
<p>and you could take that little water and</p>
<p>it activates with water it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>electrically charged material that can</p>
<p>then connect it&rsquo;s like a detox ER but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also great for the skin you can</p>
<p>make it as a mask and or put it on your</p>
<p>scalp</p>
<p>wherever the psoriasis is and it&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>to heal that so that&rsquo;s another little</p>
<p>thing for a topical but I think deeper</p>
<p>you do need adrenal help</p>
<p>and so one added thing that I highly</p>
<p>recommend is to get the massage tool</p>
<p>that I happen that comes with a manual</p>
<p>that teaches you how to do acupressure</p>
<p>for your adrenal I use this thing every</p>
<p>single night and it helps me sleep and</p>
<p>it kind of relieved extracts the tension</p>
<p>in my body and then we show you how to</p>
<p>do the acupressure on the adrenal points</p>
<p>and the flight-or-fight points and the</p>
<p>recovery points and you just do these</p>
<p>points before you go to bed do that long</p>
<p>walks make sure your food comes from the</p>
<p>farmers market and then just give it a</p>
<p>little more time okay thanks for your</p>
<p>call hey Chris you&rsquo;re from California go</p>
<p>ahead you&rsquo;re on the air yeah are you</p>
<p>doing good yeah I have a request because</p>
<p>you do three videos one on erectile</p>
<p>dysfunction and I couldn&rsquo;t find any that</p>
<p>you did on that right the second one</p>
<p>would be a toe fungus and the last one I</p>
<p>know you don&rsquo;t have which is a ketogenic</p>
<p>diet for dogs hmm that&rsquo;s a really good</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an interesting topic right there</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think about that that would be</p>
<p>a great one to do good so no let me just</p>
<p>give you a couple tips on those points</p>
<p>okay Chris okay all right so erectile</p>
<p>dysfunction the main problem with that</p>
<p>is low testosterone normally caused by</p>
<p>high levels of estrogen</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s really an estrogen dominant</p>
<p>problem men</p>
<p>get you know manboobs they get problems</p>
<p>with their right dog dysfunction they</p>
<p>have problems with extra fat</p>
<p>they lose their vitality or get up and</p>
<p>go so it&rsquo;ll be a combination to rid that</p>
<p>estrogen of doing things like</p>
<p>cruciferous vegetables there&rsquo;s a another</p>
<p>herb that I guess it&rsquo;s kind of a it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the stinging nettle root as a plant</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really good one to help balance</p>
<p>your estrogen levels as well mushrooms</p>
<p>will also help balance testosterone and</p>
<p>estrogen dominance and men the other</p>
<p>thing too even more than the food would</p>
<p>be making sure your adrenals are good so</p>
<p>the acupressure around the adrenals is</p>
<p>really important with my massage tool</p>
<p>and then getting enough sleep you got to</p>
<p>make sure you don&rsquo;t over exercise</p>
<p>because a lot of these guys are trying</p>
<p>to get the testosterone up they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>working out too much they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>overtraining they&rsquo;re not resting enough</p>
<p>to get enough recovery not sleeping so I</p>
<p>would do maybe one or two workouts a</p>
<p>week with lots of rest and take naps</p>
<p>that normally will help those are the</p>
<p>main things now as far as the toenail</p>
<p>fungus that&rsquo;s an internal problem</p>
<p>normally in your gut you have 400</p>
<p>microbes and there are different strains</p>
<p>of not foreign microbes different 400</p>
<p>different types of strains of microbes</p>
<p>from friendly bacteria to friendly</p>
<p>fungus from the yeast friendly mold in</p>
<p>your in your body you have these</p>
<p>friendly microbes so when you destroy</p>
<p>them</p>
<p>you get unfriendly mold yeast bacteria</p>
<p>fungus that grow on the external part of</p>
<p>his body so you want to put back in the</p>
<p>good microbes and I recommend</p>
<p>researching something called effective</p>
<p>microbes e/m effective microbes comes in</p>
<p>liquid I used to sell it but you can get</p>
<p>it anywhere so I decided why not just</p>
<p>have you go get it somewhere else it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not something unique you can find it</p>
<p>take a little bit in some water before</p>
<p>you go to bed drink that and that will</p>
<p>help you topically you want to get a</p>
<p>regular oil well that&rsquo;s the best fungus</p>
<p>killer that I know of and you rubbed it</p>
<p>on the toe and that will actually help</p>
<p>externally but it&rsquo;s really an internal</p>
<p>issue key to put dogs is a great topic</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna actually create a video on</p>
<p>that one simply</p>
<p>because you know if you look at these</p>
<p>dog foods they add a lot of carbs so we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want that so and then do</p>
<p>intermittent fasting for dogs - the</p>
<p>problem with people with dogs is they</p>
<p>give them so many treats it&rsquo;s like it</p>
<p>spikes the insulin and they keep going</p>
<p>then when you want to feed your dogs</p>
<p>like we feed our dogs in the morning at</p>
<p>night we don&rsquo;t do all these treats and I</p>
<p>know when you&rsquo;re training them you got</p>
<p>to do some treats but just be careful</p>
<p>with that good question</p>
<p>hey Jessica you&rsquo;re from Florida go ahead</p>
<p>yes thank you for your time I need it</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re helping a lot of people it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>amazing</p>
<p>okay um anyway I am 26 and I had a baby</p>
<p>a year and a half ago and I do have PCOS</p>
<p>it took me a while it&rsquo;s and fever but it</p>
<p>did happen thank God and I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>overweight at all I don&rsquo;t have acne I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the hair on my face I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even have blood sugar issues I just have</p>
<p>like little tiny specks on my ovaries</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t ovulate all the time so I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been like looking up stuff and I found</p>
<p>you and my sis have been going down</p>
<p>dramatically so my question is is I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing the fast thing not or cuz I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to have another baby I&rsquo;m sorry I</p>
<p>forgot that and my question is the fast</p>
<p>thing I&rsquo;m doing is for more hormonal</p>
<p>balancing than losing weight because I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need to lose weight I&rsquo;m not under</p>
<p>weight but I don&rsquo;t need to lose weight</p>
<p>right and I was wondering that&rsquo;s safe to</p>
<p>do while trying to get pregnant should I</p>
<p>not fat and just eat heat oh okay or</p>
<p>what are your thoughts on that</p>
<p>great question Jessica so first of all</p>
<p>PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome is a</p>
<p>condition where the person has these</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not really assisted follicles in</p>
<p>the ovaries and so those tend to be over</p>
<p>produced because of an imbalance with</p>
<p>higher amounts of androgens no it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t sound like you have a severe</p>
<p>case like other people we have facial</p>
<p>hair deeper voice male pattern baldness</p>
<p>whatever so you don&rsquo;t have those</p>
<p>symptoms it&rsquo;s probably like a mild</p>
<p>version of it but the point is that</p>
<p>what causes the high essure by the high</p>
<p>androgens is high insulin okay so what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing is the exact thing you need</p>
<p>to do to correct it which is in a minute</p>
<p>fasting in some keto ketogenic so yes I</p>
<p>would do that as kind of a treatment to</p>
<p>help balance your hormones as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting pregnant I think once you get</p>
<p>pregnant and it&rsquo;s really solid it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>then maybe just go with doing three</p>
<p>meals and no snacks just that that would</p>
<p>be your version so I don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>version you&rsquo;re doing now but just</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re pregnant or breastfeeding</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to have six meals</p>
<p>a day</p>
<p>you just want solid healthy meals I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do another video on that because I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s an important point but the</p>
<p>fact that you had a little bit of this</p>
<p>condition that&rsquo;s a little higher</p>
<p>antigens will shut down your estrogen</p>
<p>and you create problems with fertility</p>
<p>so you are doing the exact right thing</p>
<p>to become more fertile and get your body</p>
<p>in good shape there&rsquo;s a couple things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna recommend though for fertility</p>
<p>and also once you&rsquo;re pregnant number one</p>
<p>is to royal jelly is something that I</p>
<p>would start taking immediately that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really good fertility remedy natural</p>
<p>remedy okay the other thing is the</p>
<p>facile vitamins vitamin A from cod liver</p>
<p>oil essential when you&rsquo;re having this</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trying to become more</p>
<p>fertile vitamin A vitamin D from the cod</p>
<p>liver oil they both cod liver oil has</p>
<p>the balance of DNA those would be the</p>
<p>most important make sure you do trace</p>
<p>minerals so that baby comes out with all</p>
<p>the the minerals that it needs to form</p>
<p>and the other thing that you want to</p>
<p>make sure you know it&rsquo;s when you</p>
<p>actually get pregnant</p>
<p>unfortunately the the infant formulas</p>
<p>that women use for these babies coming</p>
<p>out or they they don&rsquo;t have time to</p>
<p>breastfeed creates a lot of issues so if</p>
<p>you can start beefing up the trace</p>
<p>minerals and fat soluble vitamins you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to prevent a lot of issues</p>
<p>with the dental structure so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no overbites or under bites</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trace minerals and the fat size</p>
<p>of vitamins allow those minerals to be</p>
<p>transported so your your child will have</p>
<p>a lot less cavities and good bone</p>
<p>structure so those are the things that I</p>
<p>would focus on</p>
<p>but fertility is mainly into healthy</p>
<p>fats and and make sure your hormones are</p>
<p>balanced so you don&rsquo;t have too much</p>
<p>insulin or antigen so I think you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>the right track just keep going add</p>
<p>those things in there and I think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have a really amazing baby all</p>
<p>right now we have Marigny you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Australia go ahead you&rsquo;re on the air oh</p>
<p>thanks dr. Berg for taking my call I</p>
<p>just want to thank you for being such a</p>
<p>wonderful teacher and I&rsquo;ve learned so</p>
<p>much in such a short time and I look</p>
<p>forward to seeing your videos every day</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t mind I&rsquo;ve got two quick</p>
<p>questions and a favor to ask and I had</p>
<p>sleep apnea due to taking prednisone and</p>
<p>Plaquenil for lupus I&rsquo;ve been on these</p>
<p>drugs since 2009 and I want to get off</p>
<p>them safely since starting the keto into</p>
<p>minute diet last month I feel so much</p>
<p>better and I was bold enough this week</p>
<p>to cut my dosage down I haven&rsquo;t had any</p>
<p>side effects so far and I&rsquo;m wondering</p>
<p>how to wean off these drugs safely and</p>
<p>you mentioned taking colostrum as an</p>
<p>alternative and would sarah peptidase</p>
<p>help as well</p>
<p>and my second question is regarding the</p>
<p>sleep apnea I don&rsquo;t use a CPAP machine</p>
<p>and wondered if I should be my mother</p>
<p>died of a brain cancer and I&rsquo;m worried</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not going to get enough oxygen</p>
<p>to my brain or would the fat from my</p>
<p>diet counteract this and the last thing</p>
<p>is the favor I just wanted to see if you</p>
<p>could do a video on the benefits of bone</p>
<p>broth I&rsquo;ve been having this during my</p>
<p>fasting period and it&rsquo;s really done</p>
<p>wonders for my energy levels with the</p>
<p>electrolytes and it&rsquo;s replaced coffee</p>
<p>for me I&rsquo;m just wondering if I might be</p>
<p>taking it too much because I can undo</p>
<p>fasting once a day it&rsquo;s sorry one meal a</p>
<p>day</p>
<p>but in their off times I&rsquo;m just having a</p>
<p>couple of cups of bone broth that I make</p>
<p>myself and I&rsquo;m hoping that&rsquo;s okay it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not going to affect the diet and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all that&rsquo;s it okay good</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good so I&rsquo;ll see if I can</p>
<p>remember all those points but a very</p>
<p>good question I think you&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>right track with what you&rsquo;re doing it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>working</p>
<p>but we just want to tweak it now when</p>
<p>you have lupus original that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>adrenal issue so I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>some adrenal supplement or support the</p>
<p>one that you would need would be</p>
<p>something called adrenal fatigue</p>
<p>advanced formula because that actually</p>
<p>is for a lowered renal to bring it back</p>
<p>up it&rsquo;s not for high cortisol it&rsquo;s for</p>
<p>low cortisol just help support that but</p>
<p>sleep apnea is an adrenal issue as</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re coming off prednisone you do it</p>
<p>gradually very very gradually and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple pointers colostrum will</p>
<p>actually is wonderful to repair it but</p>
<p>you got to do smaller doses over a long</p>
<p>period of time and that will slowly kind</p>
<p>of bring you back up the other thing</p>
<p>that you want to do is you want to well</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re already doing you&rsquo;re doing in a</p>
<p>minute fasting and keto you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>like one meal a day you got to make sure</p>
<p>that one meal is really nutrient-dense</p>
<p>and robust that&rsquo;s very very important</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t just have like a</p>
<p>couple different things and you probably</p>
<p>already know that so it&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>potassium a lot of greens the more</p>
<p>potassium you can include in the diet</p>
<p>the less need for cortisol so that&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>actually help the course all the other</p>
<p>thing is vitamin D but I would prefer</p>
<p>you get it from the Sun vitamin D is</p>
<p>really it will decrease the need for</p>
<p>cortisol as well and I&rsquo;ve done some</p>
<p>videos on the damage from prednisone so</p>
<p>you know you can do you can actually get</p>
<p>some other pointers on that but I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the right track as far as</p>
<p>saira pepper taste goes that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>enzyme for extra scar tissue in the</p>
<p>different parts of the body from serosa</p>
<p>from liver cirrhosis or things like that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the one that you</p>
<p>need I wouldn&rsquo;t focus on that I would do</p>
<p>the colostrum for sure bone bruise bone</p>
<p>broth is another great protein amino</p>
<p>acid profile</p>
<p>natural thing that people don&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>bones so I think that&rsquo;s awesome I will</p>
<p>do a video on that as far as a sleep</p>
<p>machine where you you you know an oxygen</p>
<p>type of apparatus that you&rsquo;re putting</p>
<p>over your breathing air into your face I</p>
<p>would I don&rsquo;t know if I would jump to</p>
<p>that especially if it&rsquo;s working and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>getting better you can always get a test</p>
<p>to see how much obstructions occurring</p>
<p>through the night and if it&rsquo;s a major</p>
<p>problem you can use as a temporary thing</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s up to you it&rsquo;s not a bad</p>
<p>thing but here&rsquo;s the thing as you do</p>
<p>this over time that should improve the</p>
<p>massage tool that I have I would</p>
<p>recommend using on your adrenals and the</p>
<p>back of the neck the second bone down</p>
<p>when you do those points it really helps</p>
<p>opening up the sinuses especially do be</p>
<p>you do this before bed and it really</p>
<p>facilitates more neurological benefits</p>
<p>to this part of the face sleep apnea is</p>
<p>really kind of the atrophy of a certain</p>
<p>cranial nerve in the back of the neck</p>
<p>that tends to come from high levels of</p>
<p>cortisol that then makes all the the</p>
<p>loss of tone in the back of the nasal so</p>
<p>it kind of sags and obstructs your</p>
<p>breathing so those are some tips that I</p>
<p>would I would do but hey thanks for the</p>
<p>wonderful words so Katie you&rsquo;re from New</p>
<p>York you had a question of estrogen yes</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 41 years old and in my early 30s I</p>
<p>had to have an emergency hysterectomy</p>
<p>and they I went to menopause overnight</p>
<p>which I had an unusual side effect I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if it was unusual but it took</p>
<p>months of putting me on estrogen before</p>
<p>I came out of this severe severe</p>
<p>depression and so now I take an</p>
<p>unusually high level of estrogen and</p>
<p>progesterone every day my question is I</p>
<p>started doing the ketogenic intermittent</p>
<p>fasting my body adapted very fast I</p>
<p>literally started with two meals and now</p>
<p>I can eat one meal because I&rsquo;m satiated</p>
<p>all day so I love this diet but I have</p>
<p>not dropped a single pound question and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering is your way</p>
<p>shrink it I&rsquo;ve done my measurements not</p>
<p>yet I&rsquo;m not losing inches now in the</p>
<p>past before this hysterectomy I was</p>
<p>diagnosed with of polycystic ovarian</p>
<p>syndrome which I didn&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>standard symptoms but the</p>
<p>endocrinologist said I had metabolic</p>
<p>resistance I lost over a hundred pounds</p>
<p>on my own doing not this diet it was the</p>
<p>hardest you know the six times a day</p>
<p>eating diet but then I always hit these</p>
<p>weight plateaus and start gaining again</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m wondering if there&rsquo;s a yeah you</p>
<p>get my point</p>
<p>yeah all right so a couple things let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>talk about that obviously if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing one meal a day and you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>keto and and fasting you should be</p>
<p>losing weight I mean it&rsquo;s lodged I mean</p>
<p>99% of people do that but the problem if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some underlying hormonal issues</p>
<p>which there is that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dealing with so I think you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>everything right with the eating part I</p>
<p>think we just need to do with the</p>
<p>estrogen issue when they do a</p>
<p>hysterectomy what that does is it forces</p>
<p>the adrenals to take over and do the</p>
<p>work and I think really the adrenals are</p>
<p>your issue because they&rsquo;re not able to</p>
<p>produce the normal estrogen progesterone</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re having a substitute you</p>
<p>know adding that estrogen in there so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a you&rsquo;re stuck between a</p>
<p>rock and a hard place because we want to</p>
<p>have your adrenals do the work and not</p>
<p>necessarily take it externally but I</p>
<p>would focus on the adrenal work there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>several videos that you can learn about</p>
<p>how to improve adrenal function that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>number one because it&rsquo;s kind of like an</p>
<p>early menopause situation so we want to</p>
<p>support the adrenal acupressure the</p>
<p>foods nutrition okay a couple other</p>
<p>things the fact that you had PCOS tells</p>
<p>me that you had an insulin resistance so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to give it more time</p>
<p>to do this to allow it to kick in and it</p>
<p>even sounds like if you have that much</p>
<p>estrogen probably the thyroid is</p>
<p>involved so that takes it just makes</p>
<p>everything slower and the fact that you</p>
<p>know you&rsquo;ve done other diets before you</p>
<p>Center pounds and plateaus tells me you</p>
<p>have a set point so we&rsquo;re dealing really</p>
<p>with the slow metabolism issue and you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t go any lower than one meal a day</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re gonna have to improve these</p>
<p>other body issues so we&rsquo;re not dealing</p>
<p>with a food or nutrient thing we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dealing with a physical thing that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>of the reasons I created the membership</p>
<p>site just simply because it has all</p>
<p>these other tools to work on body issues</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what you need to focus on</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably a little more extensive</p>
<p>than doing this Q&amp;A on this video but at</p>
<p>least I want to point you in the right</p>
<p>direction I would focus on getting your</p>
<p>adrenals good make sure that our is good</p>
<p>and I think then you&rsquo;ll start seeing</p>
<p>more change okay but you might just have</p>
<p>to give it a little bit more time too</p>
<p>but the fact is you&rsquo;re getting benefits</p>
<p>already probably in other levels that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a good indicator so just kind of do that</p>
<p>all right Katie thanks for calling hey</p>
<p>sue</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from New Jersey go ahead you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on the air hi thank you for taking my</p>
<p>call sure I wanted to know I started the</p>
<p>keto diet and intermittent fasting and I</p>
<p>wanted to get my father doing this as</p>
<p>well but he&rsquo;s diabetic so I wanted to</p>
<p>know what is the safe way to incorporate</p>
<p>the keto diet in intermittent fasting</p>
<p>with someone that&rsquo;s diabetic is he</p>
<p>taking an insulin is he taking insulin</p>
<p>yes he&rsquo;s taking insulin does he type 1</p>
<p>or type 2 he is type 2 okay second year</p>
<p>another question is he&rsquo;s starting to</p>
<p>have neuropathy pain yeah and I want to</p>
<p>know what I can do to help him with it</p>
<p>okay very good question sue let&rsquo;s answer</p>
<p>them number one he absolutely needs to</p>
<p>do this jump right in there is no other</p>
<p>I mean this is for a diabetic it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>decrease his Nitra insulin the only</p>
<p>thing you have to watch out for is as he</p>
<p>and does this program on a nice gradual</p>
<p>start with three meals a day no stacks</p>
<p>and the whole thing like I talked about</p>
<p>as he does this the need for insulin is</p>
<p>going to go down the need for medication</p>
<p>is going to go down so he has</p>
<p>be in communication with this doctor so</p>
<p>the doctor can make the adjustments on</p>
<p>the medication because what&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>happen he&rsquo;s gonna end up with low blood</p>
<p>sugar and then I gotta tell him to take</p>
<p>glucose I&rsquo;m like no just take less</p>
<p>medication so he&rsquo;s gonna have to</p>
<p>gradually adjust the amount of</p>
<p>medication as he does this to the point</p>
<p>where he needs less and less and less</p>
<p>and hopefully to the point we can come</p>
<p>off the insulin it&rsquo;s happened many times</p>
<p>before so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s number one if he</p>
<p>has peripheral neuropathy he tells me</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty much set in there and what</p>
<p>caused peripheral neuropathy is a the</p>
<p>high sugar has depleted his b1 and b12</p>
<p>vitamins which have to do with forming</p>
<p>myelin around the nerves so now he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have the myelin so he gets this</p>
<p>short circuit electrical problem in the</p>
<p>hands of the feet so he needs to take a</p>
<p>product go to Amazon and just search it</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the link on me but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called nerve support formula nerve</p>
<p>support formula and that is a nutrient</p>
<p>dense b12 b12 thing that I recommend</p>
<p>people take and I don&rsquo;t get any</p>
<p>kickbacks or anything with it but I I</p>
<p>know about it but it&rsquo;s a fat soluble b1</p>
<p>and b12 and you can take that has to go</p>
<p>into the nerves and actually we&rsquo;ll fix</p>
<p>that those symptoms pretty nicely but</p>
<p>yeah he needs to jump in and start it</p>
<p>immediately and you&rsquo;re gonna see some</p>
<p>seriously positive changes with that</p>
<p>okay and then I want a success story</p>
<p>all right Paris you&rsquo;re on the air from</p>
<p>Northern California go ahead good yeah I</p>
<p>have a fatty tissue and I was diabetic</p>
<p>right now it&rsquo;s controlled and my</p>
<p>cholesterol is okay my LDL is high okay</p>
<p>so for my fatty tissue I was thinking</p>
<p>maybe I should do coffee enema or garlic</p>
<p>and Emma are you okay with that so you</p>
<p>saying I&rsquo;m very fatty liver or fatty</p>
<p>tissue but I do okay yeah got it okay</p>
<p>good question I know after my keto diet</p>
<p>my skin got very dry yeah</p>
<p>eg and um the picture is darker</p>
<p>everybody thinks I&rsquo;m taking Channel you</p>
<p>know I&rsquo;m going to cancel on which I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not but that itching and drawing is</p>
<p>really bothers me and my other question</p>
<p>is what do you think about all TMS</p>
<p>because I was suffering about depression</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just going through that what was</p>
<p>that our PMS our TMS what&rsquo;s our TMS it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of electromagnetic you know wait</p>
<p>for the new stuff for the depression oh</p>
<p>God okay so can I give you my two cents</p>
<p>oh sure okay so Paris let&rsquo;s start at the</p>
<p>top if I deliver that that&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>really severely decrease your put your</p>
<p>your bile output your ability your</p>
<p>livers ability to make bile bi le so you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a bile so what&rsquo;s gonna happen</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna have a hard time</p>
<p>extracting that that type of vitamins</p>
<p>from the food to make keep the since kin</p>
<p>nice and good oily and or just the right</p>
<p>texture so it&rsquo;s not drying out so you</p>
<p>need purify both thought I would get the</p>
<p>gallbladder formula that I have because</p>
<p>that you can take one after a meal I</p>
<p>think that will solve the problem and</p>
<p>also bile salts will help dissolve a</p>
<p>fatty liver so that&rsquo;s one thing right</p>
<p>there you need to really plug in the</p>
<p>intermittent fasting you may be already</p>
<p>doing that but just if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>plugging the intermittent fasting</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to actually help</p>
<p>the gallbladder and the liver and you</p>
<p>want to keep your vegetables really</p>
<p>really high with the fatty liver so</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do this with a low vegetable diet</p>
<p>you need a lot of greens a lot of salads</p>
<p>every single day to eventually handle</p>
<p>the fatty liver okay so that will help</p>
<p>the skin in the itching by adding the</p>
<p>bile salts the depression I personally</p>
<p>would give this a little more time with</p>
<p>an ADD intermittent fasting because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>once you get in you&rsquo;re fully key to</p>
<p>adapted your moods gonna go straight up</p>
<p>and vertical but I would add right now</p>
<p>something called nutritional yeast okay</p>
<p>every day start taking maybe two or</p>
<p>three</p>
<p>tablespoons of this stuff because it has</p>
<p>in there several things for depression</p>
<p>one is b12 is b3 button b3 is the</p>
<p>greatest thing for depression</p>
<p>so that actually will turn into trip</p>
<p>tell tryptophan and help your serotonin</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I would I would recommend if</p>
<p>I were you</p>
<p>before you go into electric type you</p>
<p>know therapies and things because this</p>
<p>is a nutritional deficiency issue in</p>
<p>fact the fed liver means you have</p>
<p>insulin resistance which means it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna affect the ability to make</p>
<p>neurotransmitters and hormones and</p>
<p>affect your mood so I&rsquo;m just saying</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s stick to the cause of this issue</p>
<p>and and get that so do that and then let</p>
<p>me know how you do Paris okay Stefan</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Canada go ahead you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>the air</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;ve been I&rsquo;m gonna have to take</p>
<p>some pictures this week because I</p>
<p>started Quito I said what seven days ago</p>
<p>intermittent fasting really and its</p>
<p>leading me to fasting have always been</p>
<p>interested about it but right now I have</p>
<p>tons of energy on my 18th and 20th our</p>
<p>22nd hour I have tons in energy I can</p>
<p>goes sometimes three times at the gym</p>
<p>the last few days Wow and my muscle</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t hurt the day after but before I</p>
<p>slow down and get into a real fasting I</p>
<p>wanted to know if drinking my urine in</p>
<p>the morning or throughout the day really</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in fasting if they would take me</p>
<p>out of ketosis got it okay because</p>
<p>because when I&rsquo;m taking urine in the</p>
<p>morning gives you in your morning this</p>
<p>amount of energy but we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>wondering adding it to keto how much of</p>
<p>you know how much you&rsquo;re gonna really</p>
<p>handle it okay okay good good question</p>
<p>okay so you know I&rsquo;ve heard this I</p>
<p>personally I&rsquo;ve never tried drinking my</p>
<p>urine I have had patients come in that</p>
<p>have tried it so I&rsquo;m gonna say I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert on doing that I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a lot of data I do know a couple</p>
<p>things about it I do know a lot of</p>
<p>people get a lot of benefits not just</p>
<p>drinking tea hearin but putting it on</p>
<p>their skin</p>
<p>or things like poison ivy psoriasis</p>
<p>itching like amazing skin issues</p>
<p>improvements so no I don&rsquo;t have a video</p>
<p>on it no I haven&rsquo;t done it personally</p>
<p>but the point is that people do it all</p>
<p>the time with and report amazing results</p>
<p>I highly doubt it&rsquo;s gonna knock you out</p>
<p>of ketosis because there&rsquo;s not a lot of</p>
<p>calories in there there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>necessarily sugar in there there could</p>
<p>be if you&rsquo;re diabetic there&rsquo;s now so I</p>
<p>think it will not affect the keto and I</p>
<p>do know that there&rsquo;s benefits to that so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my answer and I&rsquo;m sticking to it</p>
<p>hey Salvador you&rsquo;re from Texas go ahead</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>Salvador doctor thank you for taking my</p>
<p>call sure</p>
<p>just get here me yeah okay great thank</p>
<p>you again for taking my call and like I</p>
<p>mentioned thank you for all the</p>
<p>information you put out for us sir so</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m first of all so start by</p>
<p>saying I&rsquo;m a former boxer and you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny that I started chemo genic</p>
<p>diet and intermittent fasting and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny they tell me I needed to carb load</p>
<p>and I still have the same energy or even</p>
<p>more energy on this type of protocol Wow</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 35 pounds down I&rsquo;m down on inches on</p>
<p>inches my cognitive function has</p>
<p>increased in my so has my muscle</p>
<p>definition Wow</p>
<p>so yes everything is going great until</p>
<p>recently I don&rsquo;t have a gallbladder and</p>
<p>recently I started getting some warm</p>
<p>pains dolphines around my liver area</p>
<p>under my right side of the ribcage kind</p>
<p>of equivalent to when I had a</p>
<p>gallbladder except it&rsquo;s more towards the</p>
<p>liver area so my question was is it</p>
<p>possible that I could have stones in my</p>
<p>liver and what a liver flush help good</p>
<p>question so let&rsquo;s talk about that the</p>
<p>biggest thing that I would recommend is</p>
<p>I would if you don&rsquo;t call blood it means</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re going to be low in bile</p>
<p>le bile salts so therefore you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>gotta watch that because you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna if you don&rsquo;t know by all that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not eventually it&rsquo;s going to kind</p>
<p>of creep up and not allow you pull to</p>
<p>pull the fat cycle vitamins vitamin A D</p>
<p>and K - so that&rsquo;s probably what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening there could be some stones and</p>
<p>liver as well so I would plug in a</p>
<p>purified bile salts the reason I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>recommend my gall bladder formula</p>
<p>because it hasn&rsquo;t has a bunch of other</p>
<p>factors in there as well that look that</p>
<p>actually work on the whole picture not</p>
<p>just bile salts you take one after the</p>
<p>meal that should get rid of those</p>
<p>sensations because you&rsquo;re just gonna be</p>
<p>bile deficient that&rsquo;s the main problem</p>
<p>and the other thing is you want to make</p>
<p>sure is you have a lot of leafy greens</p>
<p>and huge salads as you do this because</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t you can end up with a lot</p>
<p>of strain on the liver because a lot of</p>
<p>fats coming out of your body and we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to plug up that whole system</p>
<p>because you need bile salts to digest</p>
<p>fat so a little bit more so it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>important to if you don&rsquo;t have a gall</p>
<p>bladder at least give you some factors</p>
<p>that if you that replace the gall</p>
<p>bladder as a enhancement to that good</p>
<p>question then hey child you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Mississippi you had a question</p>
<p>good morning I want to wish you the best</p>
<p>on that ice cream injure - I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>interested yeah thanks yeah I love ice</p>
<p>cream uh that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m creating because</p>
<p>personally I would like it but I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like the sugar yeah go ahead</p>
<p>exactly I began the ketogenic about six</p>
<p>months ago I started out 240 pounds I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>six foot tall I started out 240 pounds</p>
<p>about a 38 inch waist I called in a</p>
<p>couple months ago and I&rsquo;d lost 25 pounds</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;ve continued to lose weight on</p>
<p>down another 15 pounds and I&rsquo;m pretty</p>
<p>sure I&rsquo;m stabilized around 200 pounds</p>
<p>Wow okay seven six foot tall 60 years</p>
<p>old 200 pounds that&rsquo;s good as far as</p>
<p>exercise I my waist just 34 instead of</p>
<p>38 pounds really good and as far as</p>
<p>exercise I do about an hour yogurt a day</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done that pretty much my whole life</p>
<p>and it as far as a getting rid of the</p>
<p>excess weight that really helped and me</p>
<p>enjoy my yoga route</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s good but my question is I have</p>
<p>a I think I&rsquo;ve settled on a set of</p>
<p>supplements going forward that I want to</p>
<p>continue with I was taking a not good</p>
<p>not pretty sure and get rid of most of</p>
<p>it but I want to go over the quick list</p>
<p>real quick with you and see if you can</p>
<p>tell me long-term if I&rsquo;m missing</p>
<p>anything and I start out today with</p>
<p>vinegar and women I also have the needs</p>
<p>of nutritional yeast coconut oil in CT</p>
<p>oil and as far as your products which I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think I can live without or the</p>
<p>wheatgrass juice the electrolytes the</p>
<p>trace minerals and I take it a case</p>
<p>upland right now but I soon as I run out</p>
<p>of them don&rsquo;t get your K and D</p>
<p>supplement I&rsquo;m taking one that you</p>
<p>recommend it was cup from natto or</p>
<p>something like that Nate oh yeah right</p>
<p>awesome okay that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m taking</p>
<p>right now and then I was taking omega</p>
<p>oils magnesium supplements and niacin</p>
<p>supplements some turmeric supplement</p>
<p>system Co Q 10 I I think I can can</p>
<p>eliminate those along with the diet and</p>
<p>with this what do you think and okay I</p>
<p>think I think you&rsquo;re doing really good</p>
<p>trials the standard thing that helps</p>
<p>people with keto is to the wheatgrass</p>
<p>juice because it has it&rsquo;s like the multi</p>
<p>nutrient on steroids but it has a lot of</p>
<p>other phytonutrients that go beyond just</p>
<p>vitamins and minerals so it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>concentrated it&rsquo;s like eating a thing at</p>
<p>rate wheatgrass juice in one tablespoon</p>
<p>the electrolytes are essential because</p>
<p>it has the trace minerals there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>multiple dextran and has a lot of</p>
<p>potassium a thousand milligrams so those</p>
<p>two are really key you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>nutritional yeast I think you&rsquo;re I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be totally fine you have</p>
<p>everything and you have the trace</p>
<p>minerals which is the liquid which is</p>
<p>always hard to get in the food and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>almost impossible to get on your trace</p>
<p>mineral so I think you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re good on</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t sound like you&rsquo;re you were</p>
<p>pre-existing diabetic if you were I</p>
<p>would recommend the insulin and glucose</p>
<p>support as the icing on the cake</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s a bad expression but I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t necessary for your situation</p>
<p>recommend it because it doesn&rsquo;t sound</p>
<p>like you even have that issue but that</p>
<p>just kind of speeds things up but other</p>
<p>than I think you&rsquo;re doing wonderful your</p>
<p>waist is 34 that&rsquo;s quite incredible so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re really close being</p>
<p>six-foot-two your goal prep maybe you</p>
<p>want to get down to 190 but I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing great I don&rsquo;t think I would</p>
<p>add anything to that I think you&rsquo;re fine</p>
<p>so I would just ride the wave if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>working don&rsquo;t change anything just keep</p>
<p>going and I think you&rsquo;re doing great</p>
<p>trials so thanks for calling I don&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>anything that stands out as being an</p>
<p>issue Darlena you&rsquo;re from South Carolina</p>
<p>go ahead you&rsquo;re on the air thank you</p>
<p>sure I&rsquo;m gonna serious issues that I</p>
<p>think I have which is thyroid issues yes</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>I just want to know like is there</p>
<p>anything that I can do naturally to get</p>
<p>my thyroid back going and you know help</p>
<p>lose weight because I I have tried</p>
<p>fasting and I mean it&rsquo;s actually my</p>
<p>religion so I&rsquo;m very familiar with</p>
<p>fasting night but I just I don&rsquo;t know I</p>
<p>just I kind of feel like I&rsquo;m stuck</p>
<p>because I work out and you know I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>changed my diet and I cannot lose weight</p>
<p>so I have a question how many meals are</p>
<p>you doing now okay yeah to two meals a</p>
<p>day okay and are you doing also keto</p>
<p>which means no juice or carb or fruit or</p>
<p>sugar or anything like that okay good is</p>
<p>your stomach shrinking no okay it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bulging yeah honestly I&rsquo;ve never seen my</p>
<p>stomach be so big okay I don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>okay so can I give you some advice</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re on the right track but if</p>
<p>you have a thyroid issue and this is</p>
<p>that I did a video on this if there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>thyroid involved that means the</p>
<p>metabolism is way down to zero and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like now we got to do something</p>
<p>I would keep going in shipped to one</p>
<p>meal a day keep working towards that</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re gonna have to because the</p>
<p>metabolism is so slow now as far as the</p>
<p>chronic fatigue goes and the hair loss</p>
<p>eyebrows what that means is that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not pulling in the nutrients you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to enhance the diet with the</p>
<p>trace minerals I have a hair formula</p>
<p>that has the trace minerals in it where</p>
<p>you can just do trace minerals so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one thing I would highly recommend that</p>
<p>you add in there make sure you do</p>
<p>electrolytes and the B vitamins ok</p>
<p>nutritionally used electrolytes because</p>
<p>as you transition into this that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really what&rsquo;s going to be needed to make</p>
<p>the adaptation I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fully adapted yet so that&rsquo;s what I would</p>
<p>do you&rsquo;re doing it sounds like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing good you just need to take it one</p>
<p>step further and be a little bit strict</p>
<p>with the frequency of the the meal and</p>
<p>just do one meal a day unfortunately</p>
<p>keep the exercise in there but I do</p>
<p>understand that the fatigue is there and</p>
<p>you have other body issues and this is</p>
<p>another good point where you know diet</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t always fix everything so you got</p>
<p>to have other techniques that go beyond</p>
<p>just nutrition there&rsquo;s physical</p>
<p>techniques that I recommend that that</p>
<p>are in my membership site you probably</p>
<p>benefit from that and then start</p>
<p>learning about how to work on the other</p>
<p>body issues that go beyond just the</p>
<p>eating so that&rsquo;s pretty much what I</p>
<p>would do but most our issues come from</p>
<p>either</p>
<p>gallbladder liver or the highest region</p>
<p>one last point the thyroid really needs</p>
<p>vitamin A vitamin A is kind of like</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t even think about that cod</p>
<p>liver oil you can enhance the conversion</p>
<p>from t4 to t3 by adding vitamin A that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably why if you don&rsquo;t have enough</p>
<p>bile to convert the fat soluble vitamins</p>
<p>into the fact to the absorbed zorbel a</p>
<p>simple form then you can&rsquo;t get the</p>
<p>benefit of the vitamin A or the</p>
<p>or the vitamin e so it takes but am Nate</p>
<p>to help thyroid but it takes bile to</p>
<p>convert not just to the active form of</p>
<p>vitamin a because you need the</p>
<p>conversion but also from t4 to t3 so</p>
<p>vitamin A is necessary in a lot of</p>
<p>different ways with the thyroid good</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>hey Danny you&rsquo;re from Cynthiana</p>
<p>Cincinnati go ahead you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>hi dr. Berg hi first I wanted to thank</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>profusely for changing my life I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>following your protocol since late</p>
<p>November I&rsquo;ve lost 75 pounds and what</p>
<p>what pant sizes what yeah that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>yeah I started intermittent fasting in</p>
<p>that late April down to one meal a day</p>
<p>Wow and I feel great you know I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>had any problems I had my OC tofu early</p>
<p>on but it falls quickly but since I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>lost this weight I&rsquo;ve noticed that my dr</p>
<p>Boyd process is protruding you&rsquo;re what</p>
<p>three per family my cyborg runs on us</p>
<p>yeah yeah and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s thinking about</p>
<p>quite a bit it&rsquo;s not sore yeah I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>recall any injury I had umbilical hernia</p>
<p>surgery an early November and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of what inspired me to lose the</p>
<p>weight once I had to her knee at that</p>
<p>time I decided that you know I could</p>
<p>take this bet again and I found you and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been a big change this I forward</p>
<p>process I&rsquo;m also having lower to mid</p>
<p>back pain and someone told me that maybe</p>
<p>a referred pain from this side boy and I</p>
<p>wondered based on your chiropractic yeah</p>
<p>its thing that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re hanging on</p>
<p>that was what I could do good good</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>and Danny definitely email us with you</p>
<p>before afters because I want to do a</p>
<p>Skype interview with you at dr. Berg at</p>
<p>dr. Berger calm because I want to see</p>
<p>those before and afters</p>
<p>okay so the xiphoid process is the lower</p>
<p>part of the sternum right here there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little piece of cartilage called the</p>
<p>xiphoid process and apparently it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sticking out you lost weight no less</p>
<p>than sticking</p>
<p>out you know that sounds like an</p>
<p>anatomical thing and it could come from</p>
<p>a hiatal hernia that&rsquo;s pushing behind it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one thing that might not be a bad</p>
<p>idea bad idea to do an ultrasound or get</p>
<p>a scan to see what&rsquo;s really doing that</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s an instructional problem or</p>
<p>is it something pushing it out because</p>
<p>it could be camouflaged if you have a</p>
<p>lot more weight now as far as the back</p>
<p>pain the mid-back pain this is a really</p>
<p>good point because the tips on the lower</p>
<p>back pain is to actually do massage on</p>
<p>the front part of your lower body</p>
<p>wherever the pain is in the back you do</p>
<p>it to the front you work with the</p>
<p>massage tool on the front part and that</p>
<p>knocks out the back pain which is very</p>
<p>opposite of what everyone else does</p>
<p>on the mid-back you work on the sternum</p>
<p>so just don&rsquo;t press on your xiphoid</p>
<p>process you could work up here on the</p>
<p>sternum</p>
<p>wherever the pain is in the back like</p>
<p>draw a line right through the back and</p>
<p>that will knock it out but I like to</p>
<p>work on the outside of the rib where</p>
<p>that rib connects to the xiphoid process</p>
<p>on both sides and that should help your</p>
<p>mid-back but it sounds to me if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mid-back it could be gallbladder</p>
<p>digestion as well so I would want to</p>
<p>look at that to make sure that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>kind of sticking up and pressing out on</p>
<p>your thyroid like especially if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like maybe some internal bloating or</p>
<p>something like that so those are just</p>
<p>things I would look at Danny but yeah I</p>
<p>definitely want to see her before and</p>
<p>after if but thanks for calling hey Ken</p>
<p>you are from the UK you had a question</p>
<p>yeah hi dr. Berg hi thanks all your</p>
<p>videos really helpful just had a</p>
<p>question about vitamin k2 I&rsquo;ve seen a</p>
<p>few of your videos and they talked about</p>
<p>the benefits of vitamin k2 with d3 I</p>
<p>just found confused between the two</p>
<p>versions of bitumen k2 MK 4 and MK 7 and</p>
<p>I just like to know which version I</p>
<p>should be taking with good question can</p>
<p>MK 4 and MK 7 are types or forms of</p>
<p>vitamin k2 vitamin k2 removes soft</p>
<p>tissue calcium from places it should not</p>
<p>be in the body joints arteries and</p>
<p>also pushes it into the bone making your</p>
<p>bone really solid vitamin k2 comes from</p>
<p>grass-fed dairy grass-fed animal</p>
<p>products grass-fed fast because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a fat soluble vitamin you can also get</p>
<p>it from NATO which is a fermented soy</p>
<p>bean product which actually is</p>
<p>disgusting if you consume it but it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>there but the mk4 version is the</p>
<p>synthetic version ok</p>
<p>the mk7 version is the natural version</p>
<p>of k2 so I would recommend sticking with</p>
<p>the natural version because I don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>to use synthetics and anything but a</p>
<p>temporary detox so I would use the mk7</p>
<p>version that&rsquo;s really the big difference</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a synthetic no that&rsquo;s the the 7 is</p>
<p>natural and the 4 is synthetic so stick</p>
<p>with the 7 and I think you&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>fine good question hey Becky</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Arkansas go ahead you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>the air yes I&rsquo;m how to do this ok I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not meeting my calorie intake ok good so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s pretty much the confusion</p>
<p>right yeah ok alright so let&rsquo;s just talk</p>
<p>about that Becky you know when you start</p>
<p>doing this you actually switched the</p>
<p>body to burning your own fat that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>being stored on your body when you start</p>
<p>doing that a lot of people their hunger</p>
<p>goes away because the food that your</p>
<p>body is eating it&rsquo;s its own stored food</p>
<p>ok so that&rsquo;s really what&rsquo;s happening so</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re gonna do is if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>hungry</p>
<p>like out people who just keep going I</p>
<p>would at least have one meal a day don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily focus too much on the macros</p>
<p>focus on the nutrients of the microbes</p>
<p>like you need a big huge salad every day</p>
<p>minimally 7 cups maybe a little bit more</p>
<p>and have that make sure it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nutrient-dense in that iceberg lettuce</p>
<p>but like some kale and there are some</p>
<p>regular spring green okay and then I</p>
<p>would also do three ounces of protein</p>
<p>maybe you want to do four or five but at</p>
<p>least three ounces of high quality</p>
<p>protein and then maybe substitute with</p>
<p>some trace minerals so that&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>would do is your meal if that if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really if you&rsquo;re not hungry right now</p>
<p>and just let your body start losing the</p>
<p>weight but you could keep the vitamins</p>
<p>and minerals intact so you don&rsquo;t end up</p>
<p>you know with a problem with a fatty</p>
<p>liver or hair loss or other issues but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I would do but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>about macros is about the nutrients but</p>
<p>of course to get the nutrients you need</p>
<p>some quantity of macros right so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna need some amounts some quantity</p>
<p>but just make sure that they&rsquo;re nutrient</p>
<p>dense and I think you&rsquo;re gonna be fine</p>
<p>but I do understand you have no appetite</p>
<p>which normally that&rsquo;s a good thing but</p>
<p>it also can come from a lack of b12 if</p>
<p>you consume b12 and sometimes be one</p>
<p>from nutritional yeast you can actually</p>
<p>increase your appetite a little bit more</p>
<p>not that you want to do it too much but</p>
<p>a normal amount okay so go ahead and do</p>
<p>that good question hey Travis you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from Atlanta go ahead Travis okay hey</p>
<p>Travis hold on hold on a second because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re breaking up why why they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>tweak that I&rsquo;m going to show you</p>
<p>something on the board okay I&rsquo;m gonna go</p>
<p>to the board right now and I want to get</p>
<p>this book sorry guidance physiology so</p>
<p>this is my plan B if that if anything</p>
<p>goes wrong down with the internet I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do something on the board I wanted</p>
<p>just to communicate real quickly about a</p>
<p>different topic which is diabetes and</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;ll come back to this question</p>
<p>diabetes what really or insulin</p>
<p>resistance like what&rsquo;s really how do you</p>
<p>really fix this thing for real how do</p>
<p>you well the key is understanding it</p>
<p>what it is and I think the biggest thing</p>
<p>that people think the diabetes is its</p>
<p>high sugar okay too much sugar so that</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where the doctors measure</p>
<p>it and they test it you chew fasting</p>
<p>glucose if it&rsquo;s high then it&rsquo;s diabetes</p>
<p>or an a1c which is an average of high</p>
<p>blood Sugar&rsquo;s over three months diabetes</p>
<p>or a post perennial glucose test which</p>
<p>is two meals after you eat blood glucose</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s high glucose but really let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ask why that is high sugar is a symptom</p>
<p>of low insulin so really diabetes is an</p>
<p>insulin deficiency</p>
<p>let me explain because in some of the</p>
<p>other videos like - there&rsquo;s too much</p>
<p>insulin when you have an insulin</p>
<p>deficiency here&rsquo;s the cell okay here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>insulin the insulin is going into the</p>
<p>cell the cell is insulin resistant it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>blocked okay so it can&rsquo;t get in there so</p>
<p>now inside the cell we have low insulin</p>
<p>that sends a signal to the pancreas to</p>
<p>make more insulin so outside the cell we</p>
<p>have high insulin inside the cell we</p>
<p>have low insulin so diabetes is a</p>
<p>situation with intracellular low insulin</p>
<p>so even if you did a fasting insulin</p>
<p>test it might show it being high because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re measuring it in the blood not in</p>
<p>the cell so does that make sense so</p>
<p>really diabetes and insulin resistance</p>
<p>is a insulin deficiency inside the cell</p>
<p>now the next question is this why the</p>
<p>heck is insulin low and cell why does</p>
<p>your body create insulin resistance in</p>
<p>the first place and that has to do with</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to use this book</p>
<p>physiology which is my favorite textbook</p>
<p>because physiology books explain the the</p>
<p>basic information of the body that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t change over time like they do in</p>
<p>like researching studies where they we</p>
<p>found the fats bad now we find it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>right and all that type of things so but</p>
<p>insulin resistance so because insulin is</p>
<p>a hormone it follows the law of</p>
<p>communication now what would cause the</p>
<p>cells to ignore insulin it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing that causes you to ignore other</p>
<p>people so what happens is you have a</p>
<p>situation where you have let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>someone talks to you too much you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna ignore them right you ever try</p>
<p>have someone that talks too much and</p>
<p>they never shut up they keep talking</p>
<p>talking</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna phase them out you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>ignore them you&rsquo;re gonna basically look</p>
<p>away and they&rsquo;re still talking to you</p>
<p>right so basically if the person</p>
<p>obsessively talks too much you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>ignore them</p>
<p>same thing happens in the body because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s too much insulin coming out</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s causing the cells to ignore</p>
<p>creating insulin resistance and then</p>
<p>diabetes so then the question is what</p>
<p>would trigger insulin to be increased</p>
<p>now you probably already know this</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve watched my videos but I</p>
<p>just want to make it really clear on</p>
<p>page 228 right here what factors that</p>
<p>control insulin secretion says instant</p>
<p>secretion increases almost 10 full</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 10 times within 3 minutes after</p>
<p>elevation of blood glucose so number one</p>
<p>increasing sugar in the diet increases</p>
<p>insulin you already know that carbs</p>
<p>right so we got that that&rsquo;s number one</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s more on the next page page</p>
<p>that 9:30 it says other factors of</p>
<p>stimulate insulin secretion amino acids</p>
<p>interesting protein says right here at</p>
<p>amino acids in the absence of horizon</p>
<p>blood glucose can cause a small increase</p>
<p>in insulin secretion so basically if you</p>
<p>consume protein without eating carbs it</p>
<p>can increase insulin a little bit check</p>
<p>this out it says right here however when</p>
<p>administrate at the same time blood</p>
<p>glucose concentration is elevated the</p>
<p>glucose</p>
<p>induced secretion of insulin may be as</p>
<p>much as doubled in the presence of</p>
<p>excess amino acids so basically what</p>
<p>that means if you increase sugar in the</p>
<p>diet with protein you can double insulin</p>
<p>secretion number one high glucose number</p>
<p>two amino acids to a small degree number</p>
<p>three adding protein with sugar will</p>
<p>double it okay so that&rsquo;s three things</p>
<p>and then the next thing is</p>
<p>gastrointestinal hormones that means</p>
<p>that every time you eat you increase</p>
<p>insulin so we got sugar</p>
<p>we got protein we&rsquo;ve got the combination</p>
<p>of sugar in protein and we have eating</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s causing in some insulin</p>
<p>resistance nowhere in guidance</p>
<p>physiology does it talk about eating</p>
<p>saturated fats will increase insulin</p>
<p>that is not true okay so it&rsquo;s absolutely</p>
<p>not true that saturated fats causing</p>
<p>some resistance or diabetes all right so</p>
<p>on that note I want to thank you guys</p>
<p>for watching I hope you got some tips</p>
<p>this week and stay tuned for next week</p>
<p>thanks for watching</p>
