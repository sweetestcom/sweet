    <p>hi guys how are you</p>
<p>today I hope you&rsquo;re having a wonderful day</p>
<p>my name is Bailey Sarian</p>
<p>and welcome to another episode of Murder</p>
<p>mystery makeup</p>
<p>was that a good</p>
<p>intro probably not if you&rsquo;re new here every Monday</p>
<p>we sit down or I sit down and talk about a true crime</p>
<p>story that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>heavy on my noggin</p>
<p>and I just kind of like tell you what happened what was</p>
<p>going on and then</p>
<p>just to keep me busy I do makeup if you like true crime</p>
<p>and you like makeup we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>married the 2</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>welcome and</p>
<p>other than that I will stop rambling and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>get into it</p>
<p>Edmund Kember III</p>
<p>he was a serial killer</p>
<p>and he also was a necrophile</p>
<p>and he would become</p>
<p>known as the Coed Killer</p>
<p>so Edmond was born December 18th 1948</p>
<p>in Burbank California</p>
<p>and Edmond he had an</p>
<p>older sister and a younger</p>
<p>sister so he was the middle child</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a middle</p>
<p>child as well so no we don&rsquo;t always turn</p>
<p>into serial killers it&rsquo;s okay if you&rsquo;re a middle child</p>
<p>so Edmunds father</p>
<p>his name is</p>
<p>Edmund Kemper</p>
<p>the Second he was a</p>
<p>World War 2</p>
<p>veteran so he</p>
<p>would describe his</p>
<p>marriage to his wife Clarnelle who is</p>
<p>Edmunds father mother</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;m being confused</p>
<p>anyways so Edmunds father and</p>
<p>mother they</p>
<p>would describe</p>
<p>their marriage as loveless</p>
<p>and damaging</p>
<p>the father he</p>
<p>would describe his</p>
<p>marriage to his wife as</p>
<p>well this is a</p>
<p>quote he said he</p>
<p>suicide missions in wartime</p>
<p>and the later atomic bomb</p>
<p>testings were nothing compared to living with Clarnelle</p>
<p>so based off what I&rsquo;ve read</p>
<p>about Clarnelle the mother</p>
<p>she was not a nice</p>
<p>lady and if there&rsquo;s anything we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>learned here</p>
<p>on these Monday</p>
<p>episodes is that when</p>
<p>Mama ain&rsquo;t nice</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t end well for the child&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right like we can we can</p>
<p>gather that</p>
<p>based off what we&rsquo;ve discussed here</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not always the case</p>
<p>but for some people it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t end well and</p>
<p>yeah so Clarinell</p>
<p>she was just</p>
<p>she was very</p>
<p>verbally abusive</p>
<p>towards her husband she</p>
<p>would make him feel like crap</p>
<p>about his job</p>
<p>I mean nothing was ever good enough for her</p>
<p>so she would do a lot of belittling</p>
<p>she would attack</p>
<p>not physically it was more emotionally and verbally</p>
<p>when she had</p>
<p>Edmund her son she</p>
<p>would refuse to coddle her son</p>
<p>in fear that</p>
<p>she would turn him</p>
<p>quote turn him gay end quote</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll call him Ed</p>
<p>but this is not the same</p>
<p>Ed as last week okay this is a new Ed</p>
<p>so Ed began</p>
<p>to display dark</p>
<p>fantasies relating to sexuality and</p>
<p>death it was said that he</p>
<p>would decapitate his</p>
<p>sister&rsquo;s dolls</p>
<p>and in second</p>
<p>grade he ended up</p>
<p>stalking his</p>
<p>second grade</p>
<p>teacher outside her house</p>
<p>I was trying to look</p>
<p>a little bit more into this like what they meant by</p>
<p>stalking but I</p>
<p>guess he would just like follow her home</p>
<p>and in second</p>
<p>grade I mean you were so</p>
<p>young so when he was</p>
<p>stalking his</p>
<p>second grade</p>
<p>teacher outside her</p>
<p>house he&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>carrying his father&rsquo;s bayonet</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>knife from the war I</p>
<p>think could be</p>
<p>wrong on that but it&rsquo;s a knife</p>
<p>in second grade</p>
<p>1957 Edmund</p>
<p>the Second the father</p>
<p>he left the family now the kids were pretty much</p>
<p>stuck with their mother ed</p>
<p>would describe his relationship with his mother</p>
<p>very difficult</p>
<p>she was an alcoholic</p>
<p>she was emotionally</p>
<p>and physically abusive</p>
<p>towards just Ed</p>
<p>like not the</p>
<p>other children</p>
<p>maybe because</p>
<p>Ed reminded</p>
<p>her of her ex husband</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just my thought</p>
<p>ed&rsquo;s mom said that</p>
<p>she feared him because at the</p>
<p>age of 15 he was already</p>
<p>6ft 4 at 15</p>
<p>the boy was big</p>
<p>so she ended up making Ed</p>
<p>sleep in a locked basement for fear that</p>
<p>he would harm</p>
<p>his sisters</p>
<p>in an interview I was</p>
<p>watching with Ed</p>
<p>he said it it</p>
<p>definitely made him feel</p>
<p>really bad because</p>
<p>everybody else got to go upstairs and go to bed</p>
<p>while his mom</p>
<p>forced him to go down into this dark basement</p>
<p>and sleep there so Ed</p>
<p>would say that his mom on the reg</p>
<p>would insult him</p>
<p>abuse him constantly telling him that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never gonna be anything in life</p>
<p>she put an emphasis on like</p>
<p>that no woman</p>
<p>would ever love him</p>
<p>so Edmund grew up to hate his</p>
<p>mother and at the</p>
<p>age of 14 he ran away from home</p>
<p>and he went to go</p>
<p>search for his father</p>
<p>to go live with</p>
<p>him and his father was living in Van Nuys</p>
<p>California ed</p>
<p>would stay with his dad for a little bit but</p>
<p>his father ended up</p>
<p>having to remove</p>
<p>Ed from the</p>
<p>house because of the stress that</p>
<p>Ed was causing onto his new wife</p>
<p>she said that she had been suffering from</p>
<p>migraines due to all the stress from Ed</p>
<p>but when I dug a little bit deeper</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t exactly figure out what the stress was</p>
<p>everybody has opinions as to what it was but</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna give wrong information</p>
<p>anywho so then</p>
<p>Edmunds father</p>
<p>was like okay</p>
<p>go stay with your paternal</p>
<p>grandmother and grandfather</p>
<p>in North Fork</p>
<p>California so Ed</p>
<p>moves in with his grandma and grandpa</p>
<p>and then Ed</p>
<p>claims that his</p>
<p>grandmother was very similar</p>
<p>to his own mother</p>
<p>she also just like</p>
<p>ed&rsquo;s mom was very abusive</p>
<p>verbally abusive</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there was</p>
<p>physical abuse</p>
<p>going on but</p>
<p>still verbally emotionally abusive and</p>
<p>Ed would say that he disliked</p>
<p>his grandmother</p>
<p>1t okay I forgot to mention something when</p>
<p>Ed was living with his</p>
<p>his mom and his</p>
<p>sisters and</p>
<p>stuff I mean I said that he</p>
<p>would he would</p>
<p>decapitate is at the word</p>
<p>he would cut off the heads of his</p>
<p>sister&rsquo;s dolls</p>
<p>but he also</p>
<p>would ask his</p>
<p>sisters to play a game he called gas chamber</p>
<p>and in this game he would</p>
<p>blindfold his</p>
<p>sisters and then tie them to a chair</p>
<p>with like some kind of cord</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>would pretend to</p>
<p>be in agony</p>
<p>until they died</p>
<p>the game doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>sense to me it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t sound fun</p>
<p>but that was a game that he played</p>
<p>he also said they</p>
<p>had like a big rug or something and in the room so they</p>
<p>would take turns like</p>
<p>wrapping each</p>
<p>other up in the rug</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>would have to try and get out</p>
<p>with no help he just like to see them struggle which</p>
<p>okay and then at the</p>
<p>age of 8 or 9</p>
<p>Ed would describe</p>
<p>going to a magic show</p>
<p>and it was at like a</p>
<p>comic bookstore</p>
<p>this magician was there</p>
<p>and he was doing a trick</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m drawing a</p>
<p>blank on the name it&rsquo;s what they used</p>
<p>in the olden</p>
<p>days to chop people&rsquo;s heads you know the holes</p>
<p>anyways he went to go see a</p>
<p>magician the</p>
<p>magician took</p>
<p>a volunteer from the audience</p>
<p>to chop their head off and Ed</p>
<p>describes being there</p>
<p>and he was like oh what</p>
<p>kind of getting</p>
<p>excited like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna chop</p>
<p>some someone&rsquo;s head off I I have to I have to</p>
<p>watch I mean he&rsquo;s 8 or 9 you</p>
<p>gonna be intrigued a little bit</p>
<p>so then the um this girl</p>
<p>that was pulled from the audience</p>
<p>she comes up on</p>
<p>stage to get her head</p>
<p>chopped off</p>
<p>awesome Ed would say</p>
<p>that the girl was just so beautiful</p>
<p>she was smiling and laughing</p>
<p>and she put her head into the</p>
<p>chopper and the</p>
<p>magician pulled</p>
<p>the string the</p>
<p>blade came down</p>
<p>and because it&rsquo;s a magic</p>
<p>trick and it&rsquo;s not real the blade like</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t chop your head off it stops</p>
<p>and the girl survived</p>
<p>but Ed would say that this kind of</p>
<p>like this introduced him to</p>
<p>control of like</p>
<p>chopping off</p>
<p>a pretty girl&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>but in an interview that I watched of</p>
<p>Ed in prison he</p>
<p>you can tell by the</p>
<p>way he&rsquo;s describing it it played like a big part in his</p>
<p>childhood he just</p>
<p>remembered it was such</p>
<p>great detail</p>
<p>and he just seemed to be getting</p>
<p>excited over it</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>where it would like it was introduced</p>
<p>you know say</p>
<p>he was like what</p>
<p>you could chop the head off</p>
<p>it was said at 10 years old and he had</p>
<p>taken the house cat</p>
<p>and he ended up</p>
<p>bearing the</p>
<p>house cat alive</p>
<p>in the family backyard</p>
<p>and then at 13 years old</p>
<p>he used a knife</p>
<p>and he killed</p>
<p>a cat he buried it also in the backyard and his mom</p>
<p>found it and there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s constant</p>
<p>when it comes to serial killers or people who end up</p>
<p>killing they always tend to kill animals at a very</p>
<p>young age like it&rsquo;s a big red flag okay</p>
<p>ed did have that pattern as well</p>
<p>flash forward to Ed</p>
<p>now living on the farm with his</p>
<p>grandparents and</p>
<p>ed&rsquo;s grandfather gave him a</p>
<p>point 22 caliber</p>
<p>rifle to shoot and kill rabbits</p>
<p>and gophers this</p>
<p>did worry like his</p>
<p>grandmother because he would see</p>
<p>some kind of rage happening with Ed</p>
<p>he would be</p>
<p>shooting and killing birds</p>
<p>trying to shoot</p>
<p>other animals</p>
<p>so his grandmother would</p>
<p>like hide their</p>
<p>their handgun that they had in the</p>
<p>house she would hide that because she was afraid that</p>
<p>Ed was gonna</p>
<p>take it when she wasn&rsquo;t looking or</p>
<p>something so</p>
<p>his grandmother did have feelings of like let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not do that let&rsquo;s not let&rsquo;s take the gun away but</p>
<p>the grandfather</p>
<p>said it&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>let him shoot</p>
<p>these animals that are coming up and like</p>
<p>ruining our farm</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s give him something to do</p>
<p>so then August</p>
<p>27th 1964 comes around</p>
<p>ed has this rage that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>building inside of him for years</p>
<p>he was now 15 years old at this time</p>
<p>and he was with his</p>
<p>grandmother in the kitchen</p>
<p>and they got into</p>
<p>some kind of argument no idea what the argument was</p>
<p>about but they had gotten into an argument</p>
<p>I guess his</p>
<p>grandmother was sitting at the</p>
<p>kitchen table</p>
<p>ed goes and</p>
<p>he grabs the handgun he comes into the</p>
<p>kitchen he gets behind his</p>
<p>grandmother who&rsquo;s sitting at the</p>
<p>table and he</p>
<p>shoots her in the head 3 times</p>
<p>now at this time his grandfather was out at the grocery</p>
<p>store like running errands</p>
<p>or something</p>
<p>but his grandfather wasn&rsquo;t home</p>
<p>so his grandfather pulled up</p>
<p>he was coming home he was in the</p>
<p>driveway and</p>
<p>Ed thought to himself</p>
<p>I should probably kill my grandfather</p>
<p>so before his grandfather</p>
<p>could even get into the</p>
<p>house okay he was</p>
<p>still out in the</p>
<p>driveway ed</p>
<p>comes out with the gun and he shoots</p>
<p>his grandfather</p>
<p>in the head as well</p>
<p>and later Ed</p>
<p>would say that he did it because</p>
<p>he wanted to</p>
<p>protect his grandfather from seeing his wife dead</p>
<p>and then possibly having a</p>
<p>heart attack</p>
<p>so after he kills them he then</p>
<p>Ed he calls his</p>
<p>mother calls up his</p>
<p>mother on the</p>
<p>phone and he&rsquo;s like what do I do you just shot 2 people</p>
<p>your grandparents what do you mean what do you do</p>
<p>and his mom said you need to call the police</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t call the police I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna call the police</p>
<p>so Ed he ends</p>
<p>up calling the police okay he does turn himself in</p>
<p>and then police take</p>
<p>him into the station and they ask him like why did you</p>
<p>shoot your grandparents</p>
<p>and Ed said</p>
<p>quote to see what it felt like</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about you guys</p>
<p>but for me personally like he needs to be locked up for</p>
<p>some time so then</p>
<p>Ed was handed over to the</p>
<p>California Youth Authority</p>
<p>so there he he met with different</p>
<p>psychiatrist to see um</p>
<p>if he had a mental illness like what was going on</p>
<p>and they also gave him an IQ test</p>
<p>that is the</p>
<p>first time that he</p>
<p>learned and</p>
<p>had learned of his high score</p>
<p>he took this IQ test and he scored a one</p>
<p>36 which is a genius</p>
<p>level and then</p>
<p>later on down the road he took the test</p>
<p>again and scored a one</p>
<p>40 which is like</p>
<p>super genius</p>
<p>oh he&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>genius okay</p>
<p>now they probably</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t have done this because it did boost</p>
<p>ed&rsquo;s ego he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fucking</p>
<p>genius so psychiatrist did some testing like I had</p>
<p>mentioned to see if he suffered from any mental illness</p>
<p>and Ed was diagnosed as</p>
<p>paranoid and</p>
<p>psychotic by a</p>
<p>court appointed</p>
<p>psychiatrist</p>
<p>ed was sent to a maximum security facility</p>
<p>for the mentally ill convicts</p>
<p>not just any</p>
<p>mentally ill for</p>
<p>mentally ill convicts</p>
<p>and then in 1969</p>
<p>he was released and he was only there for 5 years</p>
<p>which had me so confused</p>
<p>he killed 2 people</p>
<p>he killed his</p>
<p>grandmother and grandfather</p>
<p>and his reasoning for killing</p>
<p>is because he just he wanted to know how it felt</p>
<p>and then after 5 years</p>
<p>they let him go because he was doing really well</p>
<p>and his juvenile</p>
<p>criminal record was expunged</p>
<p>which means like it was</p>
<p>pretty much erased from his record</p>
<p>like he had</p>
<p>never done it</p>
<p>so when he got out he was now 21</p>
<p>doctors had</p>
<p>told him it&rsquo;d be best if he did not move in with his</p>
<p>mother or live with his mother</p>
<p>again because of her past</p>
<p>abuse but I feel like</p>
<p>he also didn&rsquo;t have anywhere else to go so he ended up</p>
<p>moving back in with his</p>
<p>mother in Santa Cruz</p>
<p>California and she had</p>
<p>moved there</p>
<p>because she took a job at the</p>
<p>University of</p>
<p>California he</p>
<p>still had to</p>
<p>check in with probation</p>
<p>psychologists</p>
<p>within those 5 years</p>
<p>of being in prison he knew exactly what to say to them</p>
<p>does that make</p>
<p>sense like he just knew how to work it so</p>
<p>Ed was considered low risk like</p>
<p>when he would check in</p>
<p>he seemed fine</p>
<p>everything seemed to be</p>
<p>going really well seemed</p>
<p>quote unquote</p>
<p>normal whatever the you know yeah</p>
<p>he seemed fine</p>
<p>so he was considered low risk</p>
<p>since we&rsquo;re here talking about him</p>
<p>we know now that he was far from</p>
<p>fine Ed began living in</p>
<p>places across</p>
<p>Northern California</p>
<p>and then periodically he</p>
<p>would return to his mother&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house when he had run out of</p>
<p>money and he</p>
<p>had nowhere to stay</p>
<p>and he also attended community college for a</p>
<p>short time and he worked a variety of jobs</p>
<p>and eventually</p>
<p>he got employment</p>
<p>with the Department of</p>
<p>Transportation</p>
<p>in 1971 now Ed</p>
<p>really wanted to become a police officer or a</p>
<p>state trooper</p>
<p>ed was rejected</p>
<p>because he reached the maximum height requirement</p>
<p>which I didn&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>that they had a maximum height requirement to become</p>
<p>a police officer like I</p>
<p>would think they</p>
<p>would want big</p>
<p>buff dudes because I don&rsquo;t know like when it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I thought he had weighed</p>
<p>Ôø°300 and he was 6ft 9</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>boy he became friends with a lot of the guys who were</p>
<p>state troopers and they gave him a nickname of Big Ed</p>
<p>and he would kind of hang around the</p>
<p>Santa Cruz police officers and he</p>
<p>would hang around like the bar that all the guys</p>
<p>would hang out at</p>
<p>he just really</p>
<p>wanted to become a police officer</p>
<p>so that was like kind of</p>
<p>crushing to him</p>
<p>because that was his goal ed</p>
<p>ended up buying a</p>
<p>motorcycle because he</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t be a cop</p>
<p>but he want to like act like one so he bought</p>
<p>a motorcycle and</p>
<p>thank God he didn&rsquo;t become a police officer</p>
<p>so while Ed</p>
<p>was out riding his</p>
<p>motorcycle he</p>
<p>ended up getting hit by a car</p>
<p>and his arm was badly injured</p>
<p>now some reports</p>
<p>say that it was his head that was injured</p>
<p>but others said it was his arm</p>
<p>so it was either his head or his arm</p>
<p>maybe it was both</p>
<p>it was injured</p>
<p>he ended up receiving a settlement of 15</p>
<p>000 from the</p>
<p>other driver</p>
<p>because they were at fault</p>
<p>and then with the settlement</p>
<p>money he ended up purchasing a new car</p>
<p>which resembled an unmarked police patrol car</p>
<p>so Ed was feeling some type of way</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t become a police officer because</p>
<p>he was too tall</p>
<p>now he couldn&rsquo;t even ride his</p>
<p>motorcycle because he got hit by a car</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t even work at the time because</p>
<p>he was badly injured so</p>
<p>like what do you do now a normal person</p>
<p>would find something else to do hopefully</p>
<p>but Ed decided</p>
<p>to just go down a</p>
<p>completely different path</p>
<p>ed had noticed a</p>
<p>large number of women</p>
<p>hitchhiking in the area</p>
<p>he would start picking up hitchhikers and</p>
<p>would refine</p>
<p>his technique</p>
<p>of how he picked up</p>
<p>these hitchhikers and got to the</p>
<p>point where</p>
<p>he could easily</p>
<p>pick up hitchhikers and seem</p>
<p>trustworthy</p>
<p>and approachable and</p>
<p>comfortable</p>
<p>so he would pick up lady hitchhikers and then he</p>
<p>would let them go</p>
<p>he offered a ride to 2 Fresno</p>
<p>State students Mary Ann</p>
<p>and then another girl</p>
<p>named Anita</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>both hitchhiking just trying to get home I believe from</p>
<p>school unfortunately</p>
<p>they did not make it to their</p>
<p>destination</p>
<p>so the families of Mary</p>
<p>Anne and Anita they had</p>
<p>reported them missing</p>
<p>and then on August 15th out in the wood</p>
<p>like a wooded area in</p>
<p>Santa Cruz a</p>
<p>woman&rsquo;s head was</p>
<p>found and it was</p>
<p>later determined that it was</p>
<p>Mary anne&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>Anita unfortunately was her remains</p>
<p>was never found</p>
<p>later on down the road he would</p>
<p>explain that he</p>
<p>stabbed and killed Anita</p>
<p>and he tried to strangle Mary</p>
<p>but that didn&rsquo;t work so he</p>
<p>ended up stabbing her and cutting her</p>
<p>throat he then brought the</p>
<p>bodies back to his</p>
<p>apartment and removed</p>
<p>their heads in</p>
<p>their hands</p>
<p>ed also said that he engaged</p>
<p>in sexual activity with</p>
<p>their corpses</p>
<p>later that year September 14th 1972</p>
<p>Ed picked up 15 year old Iiko</p>
<p>she caught on to his</p>
<p>scheme and tried</p>
<p>to escape so she was hitchhiking as well ed</p>
<p>he had taped her</p>
<p>mouth shut and</p>
<p>tried to suffocate her by putting</p>
<p>his fingers</p>
<p>in her nostrils</p>
<p>so she will suffocate</p>
<p>and realizes that this isn&rsquo;t working</p>
<p>so then he ended up taking a</p>
<p>scarf that she was wearing strangled her sadly</p>
<p>and then he raped her</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s 15 like come on</p>
<p>dick I hate this guy he&rsquo;s disgusting so then he</p>
<p>places her body into the</p>
<p>trunk of the car and</p>
<p>and then he decides I want to go get</p>
<p>an adult beverage at the bar</p>
<p>so he goes to</p>
<p>the bar that he normally always goes to with a</p>
<p>bunch of police officers like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where they all hang out</p>
<p>he goes there and he grabs a</p>
<p>drink with them</p>
<p>like who does that</p>
<p>ed does apparently</p>
<p>he then brings her body back to his</p>
<p>house and he</p>
<p>starts to just</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if dissect dissect</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if dissect</p>
<p>is the correct or dismember he takes off her limbs okay</p>
<p>he had this obsession</p>
<p>decapitating</p>
<p>his victim so he would</p>
<p>chop their heads off</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>would drop his the heads somewhere</p>
<p>also take off</p>
<p>their hands</p>
<p>oh my gosh like the magician</p>
<p>duh god okay I was sitting here forever</p>
<p>trying to figure out why he just took off the head</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why he put a big emphasis on that</p>
<p>magician thing</p>
<p>oh he takes her head off and then he</p>
<p>drove around with her head</p>
<p>and hands in the car for the day in a bag</p>
<p>and then he went to a court appointed meeting and</p>
<p>after his meeting he then disposed</p>
<p>the hands and the head in separate locations</p>
<p>January 1973</p>
<p>ed continued to act on his murderous impulses</p>
<p>and he picked up another hitchhiker</p>
<p>named Cindy</p>
<p>Cindy he he shot and killed and then while</p>
<p>ed&rsquo;s mother was out of the house ed</p>
<p>took cindy&rsquo;s body to</p>
<p>the house and he hid</p>
<p>cindy&rsquo;s body in his room and just like his</p>
<p>other victims he</p>
<p>dismembered her body the following day he took bits and</p>
<p>pieces of the</p>
<p>of her body</p>
<p>and he threw them into the ocean</p>
<p>he took her head and he buried it in his</p>
<p>mother&rsquo;s backyard</p>
<p>and he left it facing upwards towards his</p>
<p>mother&rsquo;s bedroom</p>
<p>and according to him</p>
<p>he did that because his</p>
<p>mother quote</p>
<p>always wanted people to look up to her</p>
<p>and then February</p>
<p>5th 1973 Ed</p>
<p>and his mother got into a</p>
<p>fight was filled with rage</p>
<p>and he was just</p>
<p>ready to kill</p>
<p>so he gets in his car and he uses his mom&rsquo;s</p>
<p>campus parking</p>
<p>sticker you know like a</p>
<p>community college or college in general</p>
<p>you normally have like a parking pass so you can</p>
<p>get onto the</p>
<p>campus or whatever so he takes that</p>
<p>and then Ed</p>
<p>stated that the next good looking girl he saw</p>
<p>would die so he sees 2 students</p>
<p>rosalind and</p>
<p>Alice are their names</p>
<p>he sees them they&rsquo;re both good looking</p>
<p>he said he was like attracted to them and then</p>
<p>shortly after picking them up he didn&rsquo;t stop the car</p>
<p>so normally he would like</p>
<p>pull over and</p>
<p>kill who was ever in the car with him</p>
<p>but he said</p>
<p>this time he didn&rsquo;t stop the car he was just driving</p>
<p>and he turns</p>
<p>to Alice in the back seat</p>
<p>and he just</p>
<p>shoots her several times</p>
<p>and then he shot Roseland</p>
<p>point blank</p>
<p>then he pulls over into</p>
<p>a cul de sac</p>
<p>and he I guess it&rsquo;s just like a quiet</p>
<p>cul de sac there</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t many</p>
<p>street lights or anything</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>takes the bodies and he</p>
<p>places them into the</p>
<p>trunk of his car once again</p>
<p>decapitated both of the girls and then he dismembers</p>
<p>their bodies</p>
<p>he also removed the bullets from</p>
<p>their head and then he disposed of their</p>
<p>body parts in different locations in March</p>
<p>there were some people out hiking</p>
<p>on Highway 1</p>
<p>in San Mateo</p>
<p>County and then</p>
<p>these hikers came across heads</p>
<p>called the police</p>
<p>now at the time of</p>
<p>ed&rsquo;s murders 2</p>
<p>other serial killers John Frazier and</p>
<p>Herbert Molins they were also</p>
<p>perpetrating</p>
<p>their own crimes in the area</p>
<p>which then resulted</p>
<p>in Santa Cruz</p>
<p>receiving the nickname the murder Capital</p>
<p>of the World</p>
<p>in the press</p>
<p>so there was just like a lot of murders happening</p>
<p>in that area</p>
<p>and that time for Ed</p>
<p>he was dubbed the Coed Killer and the Coed</p>
<p>Butcher by the</p>
<p>press so then</p>
<p>April 1973 Ed</p>
<p>would commit</p>
<p>what would be his last 2 murders</p>
<p>Edmund is a dick</p>
<p>so on Good Friday</p>
<p>Ed went to his</p>
<p>mother&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>he says that he had like a very unpleasant exchange</p>
<p>they got into a</p>
<p>fight did his mom know you</p>
<p>think then his</p>
<p>mother decided to go to</p>
<p>sleep and I guess</p>
<p>Ed just couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>building up for years</p>
<p>4 years and he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>dreaming of the opportunity</p>
<p>to kill his mother</p>
<p>while she was asleep</p>
<p>he beat his</p>
<p>mother to death with a claw hammer</p>
<p>he then dismembered her body</p>
<p>just like his</p>
<p>other victims</p>
<p>he removed his</p>
<p>mother&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>I mean okay look look look look</p>
<p>look side note this</p>
<p>whole story is</p>
<p>absolutely disgusting what he did to his mother is</p>
<p>he removed his mother&rsquo;s head and then he raped her</p>
<p>severed head meaning he forced his mother&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>to have oral sex with him</p>
<p>and this is like what he says this is what he says okay</p>
<p>had oral sex with his his mom&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>he then takes her head he</p>
<p>places it onto the fireplace mantle</p>
<p>and he used her head as a dart board</p>
<p>something I thought I&rsquo;d never say in my lifetime</p>
<p>but he did that okay he cuts out her</p>
<p>his mother some</p>
<p>tongue and her Larnix</p>
<p>aka the voice box</p>
<p>he cuts that out</p>
<p>and then he places them into the garbage disposal ed</p>
<p>would describe that the car the garbage disposal</p>
<p>it actually didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s so stupid he says that</p>
<p>as he was trying to get rid of these 2</p>
<p>things the garbage disposal kept spitting it back</p>
<p>up like it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>taking it he was like I have a great idea</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna call up my friend my mom&rsquo;s friend</p>
<p>Sally and he invites her over for dinner</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s waiting for Sally</p>
<p>to come over</p>
<p>once she comes over and she enters the house</p>
<p>shortly after she arrived</p>
<p>he strangled her</p>
<p>and once she died hit her body in a closet</p>
<p>and then he ended up having sex with her body</p>
<p>later that night</p>
<p>so then Ed fled the area the next day in</p>
<p>sally&rsquo;s car</p>
<p>he went to like a rent a car place</p>
<p>and then he switched out the cars</p>
<p>so he first took</p>
<p>sally&rsquo;s car</p>
<p>used that drove</p>
<p>for quite some time</p>
<p>stopped at like a rent a car place and got another car</p>
<p>then drove 18 hours</p>
<p>stopping only for gas and soda</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what he said</p>
<p>gas and soda he drove east all the way</p>
<p>until he got to Colorado and then on April 23rd he</p>
<p>made a call to Santa Cruz</p>
<p>police to confess his crimes</p>
<p>so at first they didn&rsquo;t believe him because</p>
<p>they knew him as Big</p>
<p>Ed remember I said</p>
<p>they hung out at the bar and</p>
<p>stuff and he became friends with all of them</p>
<p>so now Ed was calling them and saying</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the one that</p>
<p>killed all these people</p>
<p>just they couldn&rsquo;t believe him but he did confess</p>
<p>and he turned</p>
<p>himself into the police who then handed them over</p>
<p>handed him over to</p>
<p>Santa Cruz Police Department</p>
<p>and then during interrogation</p>
<p>he led police officers and investigators</p>
<p>to all the evidence they needed to</p>
<p>prove that he was in fact</p>
<p>the Coed killer the police</p>
<p>department was</p>
<p>completely shocked that this guy was</p>
<p>literally right in</p>
<p>front of them this</p>
<p>whole time so</p>
<p>Ed was taken into custody</p>
<p>and confessed to all</p>
<p>8 murders in</p>
<p>great detail</p>
<p>he took the investigators to various</p>
<p>disposal sites</p>
<p>where they thought the investigation</p>
<p>would never end he</p>
<p>was arrested in</p>
<p>April of 1973 at the</p>
<p>age of 24 years old</p>
<p>and at the age of 24 he had murdered 6</p>
<p>women students his own</p>
<p>mother and her best friend</p>
<p>Ed was charged with</p>
<p>8 counts of</p>
<p>first degree murder</p>
<p>he went on trial for his</p>
<p>crimes in October of 1973</p>
<p>he was found guilty of</p>
<p>all of the charges in</p>
<p>early November 1973</p>
<p>concurrent life sentences</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s never getting out so currently</p>
<p>Ed is serving his time at</p>
<p>California Medical Facility</p>
<p>here in California</p>
<p>Ed was asked by a Cosmopolitan</p>
<p>magazine reporter during a prison interview</p>
<p>how he felt when he saw a pretty girl</p>
<p>after killing his</p>
<p>mother and he said</p>
<p>quote one side of me says</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to talk to her</p>
<p>date her the</p>
<p>other side says</p>
<p>I wonder how her head</p>
<p>would look on a stick</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>ed was up for parole on July</p>
<p>25th of 2017</p>
<p>and the California parole board</p>
<p>quietly denied him parole</p>
<p>during his last parole hearing he actually</p>
<p>tried to take back his confession that he</p>
<p>gave to the police because he said that he was immature</p>
<p>at the time he was</p>
<p>young and he thought by pleaing guilty</p>
<p>he said he thought it was helping</p>
<p>build a case supporting his</p>
<p>psychiatric plea</p>
<p>of not guilty by reason of insanity</p>
<p>some reports say that he was a cannibal that he</p>
<p>ate some of his</p>
<p>victims but there&rsquo;s actually no</p>
<p>proof that he did so</p>
<p>and Ed had claimed that he did it</p>
<p>but he also says that he was lying</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t read anything</p>
<p>about him being a cannibal</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not true I</p>
<p>guess we don&rsquo;t really know if it&rsquo;s true or not only Ed</p>
<p>knows that it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>because different sources say different</p>
<p>things so it&rsquo;s really hard</p>
<p>to know what&rsquo;s true and what&rsquo;s not true I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna say he is because I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know so currently he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still in prison</p>
<p>for a while he was</p>
<p>teaching computer science inside the facility to</p>
<p>other inmates</p>
<p>also he says he</p>
<p>routinely answers his fan mail</p>
<p>at the prison</p>
<p>like I mentioned in my last</p>
<p>video get better idols be better</p>
<p>could you imagine if</p>
<p>this guy who was a</p>
<p>quote unquote genius</p>
<p>genius like you do you know like the</p>
<p>things he could have done for this</p>
<p>world and actually helped it</p>
<p>become a better</p>
<p>place but instead he</p>
<p>chose to be a</p>
<p>piece of shit you know like that sucks</p>
<p>be better be</p>
<p>fucking be better</p>
<p>I think the</p>
<p>biggest take away from this is please don&rsquo;t hitchhike</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get in a car with strangers</p>
<p>oh Uber I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think people really hitchhike much anymore but I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what you guys do out there just don&rsquo;t hitchhike</p>
<p>okay anyways I hope you have a wonderful day</p>
<p>today make good choices please</p>
<p>be safe I appreciate you guys so much for</p>
<p>hanging out with me I&rsquo;ll be seeing you guys later bye</p>
