talk about smartphone addictions in teens and children okay it&amp;rsquo;s a big problem there was a study done in 2016 involving 1,240 parents and they found that 50 of teens felt addicted no surprise there 59 of parents believed that their kids were addicted okay 77 percent of parents feel that their kids get distracted and lose attention that&amp;rsquo;s uh no surprise of course you&amp;rsquo;re going to be distracted and 72 percent of teens felt that they needed to respond to text and social media immediately when they get this like text message because texting you get like a 95 open rate so you have people that are just all day long just responding responding responding it&amp;rsquo;s training you to respond um versus email which is i think it&amp;rsquo;s only like 15 or 20 percent so it&amp;rsquo;s definitely a problem because you&amp;rsquo;re glued to this phone and you&amp;rsquo;re literally addicted i only check text messages maybe twice a day same thing with the email because i found that i wasn&amp;rsquo;t getting anything done at all because i&amp;rsquo;m constantly it and when you think about multitasking you think you&amp;rsquo;re gonna you&amp;rsquo;re getting more stuff done you&amp;rsquo;re not your power is in your attention so you really wanna do what you&amp;rsquo;re doing when you&amp;rsquo;re doing it and not doing something else by doing this thing over here 78 of teens check their devices at least hourly i think it&amp;rsquo;s a lot more frequent than that smartphone addictions are similar to drug addictions in that they do influence the size and shape of certain parts of the brain specifically in the gray matter the insula and the temporal cortex which is involved with emotion speech hearing sight memory and self control they also found that there&amp;rsquo;s more anxiety without your phone and i think a lot of people um if they lose their phone or they forget their phone they they freak out because it&amp;rsquo;s their lifeline we depend on that phone the problem is just the obsessive use of this phone and and what it can do to your body which we&amp;rsquo;re going to cover in a minute um there&amp;rsquo;s less social interaction with people in front of you because we&amp;rsquo;re communicating through the phone and a lot of people have insomnia and fatigue because of this cell phone and so what is the real damage with our cell phones it&amp;rsquo;s the emf electromagnetic fields there&amp;rsquo;s two fields one is the electric fields which is different than the magnetic fields i&amp;rsquo;m not going to get into the difference because i created a video on that which i&amp;rsquo;ll put a link down below but i found when i measured my house with an emf meter by my bed there was a massive magnetic field because of the wiring in the back of the wall which i had to hire an electrician to redo because i was literally being bathed in a sea of magnetic fields and it was massively affecting my sleep cycle so i fixed that bam sleep like a baby now all right so emf affects the brain and it affects the heart mainly but it affects other parts as well it can even affect fertility so but if you put your cell phone in your pocket next to the gonads you&amp;rsquo;re literally sending microwaves into that area also the blue light from the devices not just your cell phone but other devices affects melatonin so that&amp;rsquo;s going to affect your sleep so the main thing is damage control how can we reduce the effect of emfs in our body number one avoid contact with your brain do not hold your cell phone up to your head also if you have those earbuds or you have some type of earphones that go right into your brain there&amp;rsquo;s a very specific type you need to get i think it&amp;rsquo;s called air buds or something where there&amp;rsquo;s a space between your brain and the wire so you&amp;rsquo;re not driving this current or these these fields right into your brain which is not good use the speaker on your phone but keep it away from your head very important and really interesting when i was in practice i did a series of talks to the natural science institute that&amp;rsquo;s when i first got introduced to emf because there was a research scientist that came up to me and said did you hear about some of the studies that they were doing on children developing brain tumors from exposure to emf and i&amp;rsquo;m like really what so they were already involved in the research and that increased my awareness on that connection number two if you have a sleeping problem you don&amp;rsquo;t want to use the cell phone two to three hours before bed because the blue light is going to interfere with your ability to sleep the circadian rhythm because it&amp;rsquo;s going to affect melatonin and the next thing is that get an emf uh protection case especially if you&amp;rsquo;re carrying in your pocket you want to limit the amount of exposure that you have the emf by having this this case that can help at least reduce the exposure all right there you have it uh but check out the videos i have down below hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it&amp;rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and here&amp;rsquo;s why here&amp;rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below check

addictions in teens and children okay it&rsquo;s a big  </p><p>problem there was a study done in 2016 involving 
1,240 parents and they found that 50 of teens felt  </p><p>addicted no surprise there 59 of parents believed 
that their kids were addicted okay 77 percent of  </p><p>parents feel that their kids get distracted and 
lose attention that&rsquo;s uh no surprise of course  </p><p>you&rsquo;re going to be distracted and 72 percent of 
teens felt that they needed to respond to text and  </p><p>social media immediately when they get this like 
text message because texting you get like a 95  </p><p>open rate so you have people that are just all day 
long just responding responding responding it&rsquo;s  </p><p>training you to respond um versus email which 
is i think it&rsquo;s only like 15 or 20 percent  </p><p>so it&rsquo;s definitely a problem because you&rsquo;re 
glued to this phone and you&rsquo;re literally  </p><p>addicted i only check text messages maybe twice a 
day same thing with the email because i found that  </p><p>i wasn&rsquo;t getting anything done at all because 
i&rsquo;m constantly it and when you think about  </p><p>multitasking you think you&rsquo;re gonna you&rsquo;re getting 
more stuff done you&rsquo;re not your power is in your  </p><p>attention so you really wanna do what you&rsquo;re 
doing when you&rsquo;re doing it and not doing something  </p><p>else by doing this thing over here 78 of teens 
check their devices at least hourly i think it&rsquo;s a  </p><p>lot more frequent than that smartphone addictions 
are similar to drug addictions in that they do  </p><p>influence the size and shape of certain parts 
of the brain specifically in the gray matter  </p><p>the insula and the temporal cortex which is 
involved with emotion speech hearing sight memory  </p><p>and self control they also found that 
there&rsquo;s more anxiety without your phone  </p><p>and i think a lot of people um if they lose 
their phone or they forget their phone they  </p><p>they freak out because it&rsquo;s their 
lifeline we depend on that phone  </p><p>the problem is just the obsessive use of this 
phone and and what it can do to your body which  </p><p>we&rsquo;re going to cover in a minute um there&rsquo;s less 
social interaction with people in front of you  </p><p>because we&rsquo;re communicating through the phone 
and a lot of people have insomnia and fatigue  </p><p>because of this cell phone and so what is the 
real damage with our cell phones it&rsquo;s the emf  </p><p>electromagnetic fields there&rsquo;s two fields one 
is the electric fields which is different than  </p><p>the magnetic fields i&rsquo;m not going to get into the 
difference because i created a video on that which  </p><p>i&rsquo;ll put a link down below but i found when i 
measured my house with an emf meter by my bed  </p><p>there was a massive magnetic field because 
of the wiring in the back of the wall which  </p><p>i had to hire an electrician to redo because i was 
literally being bathed in a sea of magnetic fields  </p><p>and it was massively affecting my sleep cycle 
so i fixed that bam sleep like a baby now all  </p><p>right so emf affects the brain and it affects the 
heart mainly but it affects other parts as well  </p><p>it can even affect fertility so but if you put 
your cell phone in your pocket next to the gonads  </p><p>you&rsquo;re literally sending microwaves into that 
area also the blue light from the devices  </p><p>not just your cell phone but other devices affects 
melatonin so that&rsquo;s going to affect your sleep  </p><p>so the main thing is damage control how can we 
reduce the effect of emfs in our body number one  </p><p>avoid contact with your brain do not hold your 
cell phone up to your head also if you have those  </p><p>earbuds or you have some type of earphones that go 
right into your brain there&rsquo;s a very specific type  </p><p>you need to get i think it&rsquo;s called air buds or 
something where there&rsquo;s a space between your brain  </p><p>and the wire so you&rsquo;re not driving this current or 
these these fields right into your brain which is  </p><p>not good use the speaker on your phone but 
keep it away from your head very important and  </p><p>really interesting when i was in practice i did a 
series of talks to the natural science institute  </p><p>that&rsquo;s when i first got introduced to emf because 
there was a research scientist that came up to me  </p><p>and said did you hear about some of 
the studies that they were doing on  </p><p>children developing brain tumors from exposure 
to emf and i&rsquo;m like really what so they were  </p><p>already involved in the research and that 
increased my awareness on that connection  </p><p>number two if you have a sleeping problem you 
don&rsquo;t want to use the cell phone two to three  </p><p>hours before bed because the blue light is 
going to interfere with your ability to sleep  </p><p>the circadian rhythm because it&rsquo;s going to affect 
melatonin and the next thing is that get an emf  </p><p>uh protection case especially if you&rsquo;re carrying 
in your pocket you want to limit the amount  </p><p>of exposure that you have the emf by having 
this this case that can help at least reduce  </p><p>the exposure all right there you have it uh but 
check out the videos i have down below hey before  </p><p>you go real quick i have a course entitled how to 
bulletproof your immune system it&rsquo;s a free course  </p><p>i want you to take it and here&rsquo;s why here&rsquo;s you 
here is your environment everyone is focused on  </p><p>this over here avoiding your environment but 
what about here what about strengthening your  </p><p>immune system that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s missing this course 
will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so  </p><p>you can tolerate and resist your environment 
much better by strengthening your own immune  </p><p>system i put a link down in the description right
