    <p>Mossad will do anything.</p>
<p>Mossad has no qualms doing what it takes</p>
<p>to ensure the survival of every Israeli citizen</p>
<p>around the world.</p>
<p>Most other countries will stop at some point,</p>
<p>but Mossad doesn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Andrew Bustamante,</p>
<p>former CIA covert intelligence officer</p>
<p>and US Air Force combat veteran,</p>
<p>including the job of operational targeting</p>
<p>in cryptic communications and launch operations</p>
<p>for 200 nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>Andrew&rsquo;s over seven years as a CIA spy</p>
<p>have given him a skillset and a perspective on the world</p>
<p>that is fascinating to explore.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Andrew Bustamante.</p>
<p>The Central Intelligence Agency was formed</p>
<p>almost 75 years ago.</p>
<p>What is the mission of the CIA?</p>
<p>How does it work?</p>
<p>The mission of the CIA is to collect intelligence</p>
<p>from around the world that supports</p>
<p>a national security mission and be the central repository</p>
<p>for all other intelligence agencies</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s one collective source</p>
<p>where all intelligence can be synthesized</p>
<p>and then passed forward to the decision makers.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t include domestic intelligence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s primarily looking outward outside the United States.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>CIA is the foreign intelligence collection,</p>
<p>king spoke, if you will.</p>
<p>FBI does domestic,</p>
<p>and then Department of Homeland Security does domestic.</p>
<p>Law enforcement essentially handles all things domestic.</p>
<p>Intelligence is not law enforcement,</p>
<p>so we technically cannot work inside the United States.</p>
<p>Is there clear lines to be drawn between,</p>
<p>like you just said, the FBI, CIA, FBI,</p>
<p>and the other U.S. intelligence agencies</p>
<p>like the DIA, Defense Intelligence Agency,</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security,</p>
<p>NSA, National Security Agency, and there&rsquo;s a list.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a list of about 33</p>
<p>different intelligence organizations.</p>
<p>Yeah. So like the Army, the Navy has,</p>
<p>all the different organizations</p>
<p>have their own intelligence groups.</p>
<p>So is there clear lines here to be drawn,</p>
<p>or is the CIA the giant integrator of all of these?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit of both, to be honest.</p>
<p>So yes, there are absolutely lines,</p>
<p>and more so than the lines.</p>
<p>There are lines that divide what our primary mission is.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s gotta be prioritized.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the benefits</p>
<p>and the superpowers of the United States,</p>
<p>is we prioritize everything.</p>
<p>So different intelligence organizations are prioritized</p>
<p>to collect certain types of intelligence.</p>
<p>And then within the confines of how they collect,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also given unique authorities,</p>
<p>authorities are a term that&rsquo;s directed</p>
<p>by the executive branch.</p>
<p>Different agencies have different authorities</p>
<p>to execute missions in different ways.</p>
<p>FBI can&rsquo;t execute the same way CIA executes,</p>
<p>and CIA can&rsquo;t execute the same way NGA executes.</p>
<p>But then at the end, excuse me, when it&rsquo;s all collected,</p>
<p>then yes, CIA still acts as a final synthesizing repository</p>
<p>to create what&rsquo;s known as the president&rsquo;s daily brief,</p>
<p>the PDB, the only way CIA can create the PDB</p>
<p>is by being the single source of all source intelligence</p>
<p>from around the IC, the intelligence community,</p>
<p>which are those 30 some odd and always changing organizations</p>
<p>that are sponsored for intelligence operations.</p>
<p>What is the PDB, the president&rsquo;s daily brief look like?</p>
<p>How long is it?</p>
<p>What does it contain?</p>
<p>So first of all, it looks like the most expensive</p>
<p>book report you can ever imagine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got its own binder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all very high end.</p>
<p>It feels important, it looks important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like a cheap trapper keeper.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somewhere between, I would give it probably</p>
<p>between 50 and 125 pages a day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s produced every day around two o clock in the morning</p>
<p>by a dedicated group of analysts.</p>
<p>And each page is essentially a short paragraph</p>
<p>to a few paragraphs about a priority happening</p>
<p>that affects national security from around the world.</p>
<p>The president rarely gets to the entire briefing in a day.</p>
<p>He relies on a briefer instead to prioritize</p>
<p>what inside the briefing needs to be shared</p>
<p>with the president.</p>
<p>Because some days the PDB will get briefed in 10 minutes</p>
<p>and some days it&rsquo;ll be briefed over the course of two hours.</p>
<p>It depends on the president&rsquo;s schedule.</p>
<p>How much competition is there for the first page?</p>
<p>And so how much jockeying there is for attention?</p>
<p>I imagine for all the different intelligence agencies</p>
<p>and within the CIA there&rsquo;s probably different groups</p>
<p>that are modular and they all care about different nations</p>
<p>or different cases.</p>
<p>Do you understand how much competition there is</p>
<p>for the attention, for the limited attention</p>
<p>of the president?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re 100% correct in how the agency</p>
<p>and how officers and managers at the agency handle the PDB.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a ton of competition.</p>
<p>Everybody wants to be the first on the radar.</p>
<p>Everybody wants to be on the first page.</p>
<p>The thing that we&rsquo;re not baking into the equation</p>
<p>is the president&rsquo;s interests.</p>
<p>The president dictates what&rsquo;s on the first page of his PDB</p>
<p>and he will tell them usually the day before,</p>
<p>I wanna see this on the first page tomorrow.</p>
<p>Bring this to me in the beginning.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna hear about what&rsquo;s happening in Mozambique.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really care about what&rsquo;s happening in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>I wanna see one, two, three.</p>
<p>And regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>those are the three biggest things in the world,</p>
<p>the president&rsquo;s the executive, he&rsquo;s the one.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the ultimate customer.</p>
<p>So we do what the customer says.</p>
<p>That has backfired in the past.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already started seeing</p>
<p>how that could go wrong, that has backfired in the past,</p>
<p>but that is essentially what happens</p>
<p>when you serve in the executive branch.</p>
<p>You serve the executive.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the role of the director of the CIA</p>
<p>versus the president?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that dance like?</p>
<p>So the president really leads the focus of the CIA?</p>
<p>The president is the commander in chief for the military,</p>
<p>but the president is also the executive</p>
<p>for the entirety of the intelligence community.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s the ultimate customer.</p>
<p>If you look at it like a business,</p>
<p>the customer, the person spending the money</p>
<p>is the president and the director is the CEO.</p>
<p>So if the director doesn&rsquo;t create what the president wants,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be a new director.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the director of CIA</p>
<p>is a presidential appointed position.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;re extremely qualified</p>
<p>intelligence professionals.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;re just professional politicians</p>
<p>or soldiers that get put into that seat</p>
<p>because the president trusts them</p>
<p>to do what he wants them to do.</p>
<p>Another gaping area that causes problems,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s still the way it is.</p>
<p>So you think this is a problematic configuration</p>
<p>of the whole system?</p>
<p>Massive flaw in the system.</p>
<p>It is a massive flaw in the system</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re essentially appointing a director</p>
<p>to do what you want them to do,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re assigning a crony.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we define corruption as</p>
<p>within the United States.</p>
<p>And inside the United States,</p>
<p>we say if you pick somebody outside of merit</p>
<p>for any other reason other than merit,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s cronyism or it&rsquo;s nepotism.</p>
<p>Here, that&rsquo;s exactly what our structure is built on.</p>
<p>All presidential appointees</p>
<p>are appointed on something other than merit.</p>
<p>So for an intelligence agency to be effective,</p>
<p>it has to discover the truth and communicate that truth.</p>
<p>And maybe if you&rsquo;re appointing the director of that agency,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not, they&rsquo;re less likely to communicate the truth</p>
<p>to you unless the truth aligns perfectly</p>
<p>with your desired worldview.</p>
<p>Well, not necessarily perfectly</p>
<p>because there are other steps, right?</p>
<p>They have to be, they have to go in front of Congress</p>
<p>and they have to have the support</p>
<p>of multiple legislatures or legislators,</p>
<p>but the challenge is that the shortlist of people</p>
<p>who even get the opportunity aren&rsquo;t a meritorious list.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shortlist based off of who the president is picking</p>
<p>or who the would be president is picking.</p>
<p>Now, I think we&rsquo;ve proven</p>
<p>that an intelligence organization can be,</p>
<p>an intelligence organization can be extremely effective</p>
<p>even within the flawed system.</p>
<p>The challenge is how much more effective could we be</p>
<p>if we improved?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I think that&rsquo;s the challenge</p>
<p>that faces a lot of the US government.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a challenge that has resulted</p>
<p>in what we see today when it comes to the decline</p>
<p>of American power and American influence,</p>
<p>the rise of foreign influence, authoritarian powers,</p>
<p>and a shrinking US economy, a growing Chinese economy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, we have questions, hard questions</p>
<p>we need to ask ourselves</p>
<p>about how we&rsquo;re gonna handle the future.</p>
<p>What aspect of that communication between the president</p>
<p>and the CIA could be fixed to help fix the problems</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re referring to</p>
<p>in terms of the decline of American power?</p>
<p>So when you talk about the president wanting to prioritize</p>
<p>what the president cares about,</p>
<p>that immediately shows a break</p>
<p>between what actually matters</p>
<p>to the longterm success of the United States</p>
<p>versus what happened,</p>
<p>what benefits the short term success</p>
<p>of the current president.</p>
<p>Because any president is just a human being</p>
<p>and has a very narrow focus.</p>
<p>And narrow focus is not a longterm calculation.</p>
<p>Exactly, what&rsquo;s the maximum amount of years</p>
<p>the president can be president?</p>
<p>Eight.</p>
<p>He has to be, he or she.</p>
<p>In the United States.</p>
<p>In the United States,</p>
<p>according to our current constitution.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re very limited</p>
<p>in terms of what they have to prioritize.</p>
<p>And then if you look at a four year cycle,</p>
<p>two years of that is essentially preparing</p>
<p>for the next election cycle.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s only two years of really quality attention</p>
<p>you get from the president,</p>
<p>who is the chief executive</p>
<p>of all the intelligence community.</p>
<p>So the most important thing to them</p>
<p>is not always the most important thing</p>
<p>to the longterm survival of the United States.</p>
<p>What do you make of the hostile relationship</p>
<p>that to me at least stands out of the presidents</p>
<p>between Donald Trump and the CIA?</p>
<p>Was that a very kind of personal bickering?</p>
<p>I mean, is there something interesting to you</p>
<p>about the dynamics between that particular president</p>
<p>and that particular instantiation</p>
<p>of the intelligence agency?</p>
<p>Man, there were lots of things fascinating to me</p>
<p>about that relationship.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the good and the bad, sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>So let me start with the good first</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t think there was any good.</p>
<p>So the good thing is we saw that the president</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the chief customer, the executive to the CIA,</p>
<p>when the president doesn&rsquo;t want to hear</p>
<p>what CIA has to say, he&rsquo;s not gonna listen.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s an important lesson</p>
<p>for everyone to take home.</p>
<p>If the president doesn&rsquo;t care what you have to say,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna take funding away</p>
<p>or she will take funding away.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna take attention away.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to shut down your operations, your missions.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna kill the careers of the people working there.</p>
<p>Think about that, for the four years</p>
<p>that President Trump was the president,</p>
<p>basically everybody at CIA, their career was put on pause.</p>
<p>Some people&rsquo;s careers were ended.</p>
<p>Some people voluntarily left their career there</p>
<p>because they found themselves working for a single customer</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t want what they had to produce.</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Donald Trump did not display significant,</p>
<p>deep interest in the output.</p>
<p>He did not trust it, yeah.</p>
<p>He was a disinterested customer.</p>
<p>Exactly right.</p>
<p>Of the information.</p>
<p>And then what do disinterested customers do?</p>
<p>They go find someone else to create their product.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what Donald Trump did.</p>
<p>And he did it through the private intelligence world,</p>
<p>funding private intelligence companies</p>
<p>to run their own operations that brought him</p>
<p>the information he cared about when CIA wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It also didn&rsquo;t help that CIA</p>
<p>stepped outside of their confines, right?</p>
<p>CIA is supposed to collect foreign intelligence</p>
<p>and not comment on domestic matters.</p>
<p>They went way outside of that</p>
<p>when they started challenging the president,</p>
<p>when they started questioning the results,</p>
<p>when they started publicly claiming Russian influence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all something the FBI could have handled by itself.</p>
<p>The Justice Department could have handled by itself.</p>
<p>CIA had no place to contribute to that conversation.</p>
<p>And when they did, all they did was undermine</p>
<p>the relationship they had with their primary customer.</p>
<p>Let me sort of focus in on this relationship</p>
<p>between the president or the leader</p>
<p>and the intelligence agency</p>
<p>and look outside the United States.</p>
<p>It seems like authoritarian regimes</p>
<p>or regimes throughout history,</p>
<p>if you look at Stalin and Hitler,</p>
<p>if you look at today with Vladimir Putin,</p>
<p>the negative effects of power</p>
<p>corrupting the mind of a leader</p>
<p>manifest itself is that they start</p>
<p>to get bad information from the intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>So this kind of thing that you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>over time, they start hearing information</p>
<p>they want to hear.</p>
<p>The agency starts producing</p>
<p>only the kind of information they want to hear,</p>
<p>and the leader&rsquo;s worldview starts becoming distorted</p>
<p>to where the propaganda they generate</p>
<p>is also the thing that the intelligence agencies</p>
<p>provide to them, and so they start getting this,</p>
<p>they start believing their own propaganda,</p>
<p>and they start getting a distorted view of the world.</p>
<p>Sorry for the sort of walking through in a weird way,</p>
<p>but I guess I want to ask, do you think,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s look at Vladimir Putin specifically.</p>
<p>Do you think he&rsquo;s getting accurate information</p>
<p>about the world?</p>
<p>Do you think he knows the truth of the world,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s the war in Ukraine,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s the behavior of the other nations,</p>
<p>in NATO, the United States in general?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rare that I&rsquo;ll talk about just thinking.</p>
<p>I prefer to share my assessment,</p>
<p>why I assess things a certain way,</p>
<p>rather than just what&rsquo;s my random opinion.</p>
<p>In my assessment, Vladimir Putin is winning.</p>
<p>Russia is winning.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re winning in Ukraine, but they&rsquo;re also winning</p>
<p>the battle of influence against the West.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re winning in the face of economic sanctions.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re winning.</p>
<p>Empirically, when you look at the math, they&rsquo;re winning.</p>
<p>So when you ask me whether or not Putin</p>
<p>is getting good information from his intelligence services,</p>
<p>when I look at my overall assessment of multiple data points,</p>
<p>he must be getting good information.</p>
<p>Do I know how or why?</p>
<p>I do not.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how or why it works there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how such deep cronyism,</p>
<p>such deep corruption can possibly yield true real results.</p>
<p>And yet, somehow there are real results happening.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s either excessive waste and an accidental win,</p>
<p>or there really is a system and a process there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s functioning.</p>
<p>So this winning idea is very interesting.</p>
<p>In what way, short term and long term, is Russia winning?</p>
<p>Some people say there was a miscalculation</p>
<p>of the way the invasion happened.</p>
<p>There was an assumption that you would be able</p>
<p>to successfully take Kiev.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be able to successfully capture the East,</p>
<p>the South, and the North of Ukraine.</p>
<p>And with what now appears to be</p>
<p>significantly insufficient troops</p>
<p>spread way too thin across way too large of a front.</p>
<p>So that seems to be like an intelligence failure.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be like winning.</p>
<p>In another way, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like winning</p>
<p>if we put aside the human cost of war.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem like winning</p>
<p>because the hearts and minds of the West</p>
<p>were completely on the side of Ukraine.</p>
<p>This particular leader, Volodymyr Zelensky,</p>
<p>captured the attention of the world</p>
<p>and the hearts and minds of Europe, the West,</p>
<p>and many other nations throughout the world,</p>
<p>both financially, in terms of military equipment,</p>
<p>and in terms of sort of social and cultural</p>
<p>and emotional support for the independence fight</p>
<p>of this nation.</p>
<p>That seems to be like a miscalculation.</p>
<p>So against that pushback,</p>
<p>why do you think there&rsquo;s still kernels</p>
<p>of winning in this on the Russian side?</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re laying out isn&rsquo;t incorrect.</p>
<p>And the miscalculations are not unexpected.</p>
<p>Anybody who&rsquo;s been to a military college,</p>
<p>including the Army War College in Pennsylvania,</p>
<p>where so many of our military leaders are brought up,</p>
<p>when you look at the conflict in Ukraine,</p>
<p>it fits the exact mold</p>
<p>of what an effective longterm military conflict,</p>
<p>protracted military conflict,</p>
<p>would and should look like for military dominance.</p>
<p>Now, did Zelensky and did the Ukrainians</p>
<p>shock the world?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>But in that, they also shocked American intelligence,</p>
<p>which, like you said, miscalculated.</p>
<p>The whole world miscalculated</p>
<p>how the Ukrainians would respond.</p>
<p>Putin did not move in there accidentally.</p>
<p>He had an assessment.</p>
<p>He had high likelihood of a certain outcome,</p>
<p>and that outcome did not happen.</p>
<p>Why did he have that calculation?</p>
<p>Because in 2014, it worked.</p>
<p>He invaded, he took Crimea in 14 days.</p>
<p>He basically created an infiltration campaign</p>
<p>that turned key leaders over</p>
<p>in the first few days of the conflict.</p>
<p>So essentially, there was no conflict.</p>
<p>It worked in 2008 when he took Georgia.</p>
<p>Nobody talks about that.</p>
<p>He invaded Georgia the exact same way, and it worked.</p>
<p>So in 2008, it worked.</p>
<p>In 2014, it worked.</p>
<p>There was no reason to believe it wasn&rsquo;t going to work again.</p>
<p>So he just carried out the same campaign.</p>
<p>But this time, something was different.</p>
<p>That was a miscalculation for sure on the part of Putin.</p>
<p>And the reason that there was no support from the West,</p>
<p>because let&rsquo;s not forget, there is no support.</p>
<p>There is nothing other than the Lend Lease Act,</p>
<p>which is putting Ukraine in massive debt right now</p>
<p>to the West.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only form of support they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>from NATO or the United States.</p>
<p>So if somebody believed Ukraine would win,</p>
<p>if somebody believed Ukraine had a chance,</p>
<p>they would have gotten more material support</p>
<p>than just debt.</p>
<p>And we can jump into that anytime you want to.</p>
<p>But the whole world miscalculated.</p>
<p>Everybody thought Russia was going to win in 14 days.</p>
<p>I said that they would win in 14 days</p>
<p>because that was the predominant calculation.</p>
<p>Once the first invasion didn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>then the military does what professional militaries do, man.</p>
<p>They reevaluate, they reorganize leaders,</p>
<p>and then they take a new approach.</p>
<p>You saw three approaches.</p>
<p>The first two did not work.</p>
<p>The first two campaigns against Ukraine did not work</p>
<p>the way they were supposed to work.</p>
<p>The third has worked exactly like it&rsquo;s supposed to work.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need Kiev to win Ukraine.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need hearts and minds to win Ukraine.</p>
<p>What you need is control of natural resources,</p>
<p>which they&rsquo;re taking in the East,</p>
<p>and you need access to the heartbeat,</p>
<p>the blood flow of food and money into the country,</p>
<p>which they&rsquo;re taking in the South.</p>
<p>The fact that Ukraine had to go to the negotiation table</p>
<p>with Russia and Turkey in order to get exports</p>
<p>out of the Black Sea approved again</p>
<p>demonstrates just how much Ukraine is losing.</p>
<p>The aggressor had a seat at the negotiation table</p>
<p>to allow Ukraine the ability to even export</p>
<p>one of its top exports.</p>
<p>If Russia would have said no,</p>
<p>then they would not have had that.</p>
<p>Russia has, that&rsquo;s like someone holding your throat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like somebody holding your jugular vein and saying,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t do what I tell you to do,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m not gonna let you breathe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna let blood flow to your brain.</p>
<p>So do you think it&rsquo;s possible that Russia</p>
<p>takes the South of Ukraine?</p>
<p>It takes, so starting from Mariupol, the Kherson region.</p>
<p>All the way to Odessa.</p>
<p>And into Moldova.</p>
<p>I believe all of that will happen before the fall.</p>
<p>Fall of this year?</p>
<p>Fall of this year.</p>
<p>Before winter hits Europe,</p>
<p>NATO wants Germany needs to be able to have sanctions lifted</p>
<p>so they can tap into Russian power.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way they can have those sanctions lifted</p>
<p>unless Russia wins.</p>
<p>And Russia also knows that all of Europe,</p>
<p>all of NATO is the true,</p>
<p>the true people feeling the pain of the war</p>
<p>outside of Ukraine are the NATO countries</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re so heavily reliant on Russia.</p>
<p>And as they have supported American sanctions against Russia,</p>
<p>their people feel the pain.</p>
<p>Economically, their people feel the pain.</p>
<p>What are they gonna do in the winter?</p>
<p>Because without Russian gas,</p>
<p>their people are gonna freeze to death.</p>
<p>Ukrainian people.</p>
<p>People all over NATO.</p>
<p>Ukraine, everybody knows Ukraine&rsquo;s at risk.</p>
<p>Everybody knows Ukrainians are dying.</p>
<p>The game of war isn&rsquo;t played just,</p>
<p>it isn&rsquo;t even played majoritively</p>
<p>by the people who are fighting.</p>
<p>The game of war is played by everyone else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an economic game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a military game.</p>
<p>The flow of resources and energy.</p>
<p>Attention. And food.</p>
<p>Exactly right.</p>
<p>I was on the front in the Kherson region,</p>
<p>the very area that you&rsquo;re referring to,</p>
<p>and I spoke to a lot of people,</p>
<p>and the morale is incredibly high.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think the people in that region,</p>
<p>soldiers, volunteer soldiers, civilians,</p>
<p>are going to give up that land without dying.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>I mean, in order to take Odessa,</p>
<p>would require huge amount of artillery</p>
<p>and slaughter of civilians, essentially.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna use artillery in Odessa</p>
<p>because Odessa&rsquo;s too important to Russian culture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be even uglier than that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be clearing of streets,</p>
<p>clearing of buildings, person by person, troop by troop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be a lot like what it was in Margol.</p>
<p>Just shooting at civilians.</p>
<p>Because they can&rsquo;t afford to just do bombing raids</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re gonna destroy cultural,</p>
<p>significant architecture that&rsquo;s just too important</p>
<p>to the Russian culture,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gonna demoralize their own Russian people.</p>
<p>I have to do a lot of thinking</p>
<p>to try to understand what I even feel.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but in terms of information,</p>
<p>the thing that the soldiers are saying,</p>
<p>the Russian soldiers are saying,</p>
<p>the thing the Russian soldiers really believe</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re freeing,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re liberating the Ukrainian people from Nazis.</p>
<p>And they believe this.</p>
<p>Because I visited Ukraine,</p>
<p>I spoke to over 100,</p>
<p>probably a couple hundred Ukrainian people</p>
<p>from different walks of life.</p>
<p>It feels like the Russian soldiers, at least,</p>
<p>are under a cloud of propaganda.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not operating on a clear view of the whole world.</p>
<p>And given all that,</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t see Russia taking the South</p>
<p>without committing war crimes.</p>
<p>And if Vladimir Putin is aware of what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in terms of the treatment of civilians,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see him pushing forward all the way</p>
<p>to take the South,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s not going to be effective strategy</p>
<p>for him to win the hearts and minds of these people.</p>
<p>Autocracies don&rsquo;t need to win hearts and minds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a staunchly democratic point of view.</p>
<p>Hearts and minds mean very little</p>
<p>to people who understand core basic needs and true power.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see Xi Jinping worrying</p>
<p>about hearts and minds in China.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see it in North Korea.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see it in Congo.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see it in most of the world.</p>
<p>Hearts and minds are a luxury.</p>
<p>In reality, what people need is food, water, power.</p>
<p>They need income to be able to secure a lifestyle.</p>
<p>It is absolutely sad.</p>
<p>I am not in any way, shape or form saying</p>
<p>that my assessment on this is enriching</p>
<p>or enlightening or hopeful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just fact.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just calculatable empirical evidence.</p>
<p>If Putin loses in Ukraine, the losses,</p>
<p>the influential losses, the economic losses,</p>
<p>the lives lost, the power lost is too great.</p>
<p>So it is better for him to push and push and push</p>
<p>through war crimes, through everything else.</p>
<p>War crimes are something defined</p>
<p>by the international court system.</p>
<p>The international court system has Russia</p>
<p>as part of its board.</p>
<p>And the international court system is largely powerless</p>
<p>when it comes to enforcing its own outcomes.</p>
<p>So the real risk gain scenario here</p>
<p>for Russia is significantly in favor of gain over risk.</p>
<p>The other thing that I think is important</p>
<p>to talk about is we, everybody is trapped</p>
<p>in the middle of a gigantic information war.</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s battlefield bullets and cannons and tanks,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a massive informational war.</p>
<p>The same narrative that you see these ground troops</p>
<p>in Ukraine, these Russian ground troops in Ukraine,</p>
<p>believing they&rsquo;re clearing the land of Nazis.</p>
<p>That information is being fed to them</p>
<p>from their own home country.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why people seem to think</p>
<p>that the information that they&rsquo;re reading in English</p>
<p>is any more or less true.</p>
<p>Every piece of news coming out of the West,</p>
<p>every piece of information coming out</p>
<p>in the English language is also a giant narrative</p>
<p>being shared intentionally to try to undermine the morale</p>
<p>and the faithfulness of English speaking Russians,</p>
<p>which somebody somewhere knows exactly</p>
<p>how many of those there are.</p>
<p>So we have to recognize that we&rsquo;re not getting</p>
<p>true information from other side</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a strategic value in making sure</p>
<p>that there is just the right amount</p>
<p>of mis or disinformation out there.</p>
<p>Not because someone&rsquo;s trying to lie to Americans,</p>
<p>but because someone is trying to influence</p>
<p>the way English speaking Russians think.</p>
<p>And in that world, that&rsquo;s exactly why you see</p>
<p>so many news articles cited to anonymous sources,</p>
<p>government officials who do not wanna be named.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing that links back responsibility there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing that can go to court there,</p>
<p>but the information still gets released.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s enough to make Ukrainians believe</p>
<p>that the United States is gonna help them</p>
<p>or that the West is gonna help them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enough to make Russians think</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to lose.</p>
<p>And maybe they should just give up now</p>
<p>and leave from the battlefield now.</p>
<p>We have to understand.</p>
<p>We are in the middle of a giant information war.</p>
<p>Maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>but it feels like in the English speaking world,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s harder to control.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s harder to fight the information war</p>
<p>because of, some people say there&rsquo;s not really</p>
<p>a freedom of speech in this country,</p>
<p>but I think if you compare,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot more freedom of speech.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just harder to control narratives</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a bunch of guerrilla journalists</p>
<p>that are able to just publish anything they want</p>
<p>on Twitter or anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just harder to control narratives.</p>
<p>So people don&rsquo;t understand what freedom of speech is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first major problem.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s shameful how many people in the United States</p>
<p>do not understand what freedom of speech actually protects.</p>
<p>So that aside, you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>Fighting the information war in the West</p>
<p>is extremely difficult</p>
<p>because anyone with a blog, anyone with a Twitter account,</p>
<p>anyone, I mean, anyone can call themselves</p>
<p>a journalist, essentially.</p>
<p>We live in a world, we live in a country</p>
<p>where people read the headline</p>
<p>and they completely bypass the author line</p>
<p>and they go straight into the content.</p>
<p>And then they decide whether the content&rsquo;s real or not</p>
<p>based on how they feel</p>
<p>instead of based on empirical, measurable evidence.</p>
<p>So you mentioned the Lend Lease Act</p>
<p>and the support of the United States,</p>
<p>support of Ukraine by the United States.</p>
<p>Are you skeptical to the level of support</p>
<p>that the United States is providing</p>
<p>and is going to provide over time?</p>
<p>The strategy that the United States has taken</p>
<p>to support Ukraine is similar to the strategy we took</p>
<p>to support Great Britain during World War II.</p>
<p>The enactment of the Lend Lease Act</p>
<p>is a perfect example of that.</p>
<p>The Lend Lease Act means that we are lending</p>
<p>or leasing equipment to the Ukrainian government</p>
<p>in exchange for future payment.</p>
<p>So every time a rocket is launched,</p>
<p>every time a drone crashes into a tank,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a bill that Ukraine is just racking up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when you go to a restaurant</p>
<p>and you start drinking shots.</p>
<p>Sometime the bill will come due.</p>
<p>This is exactly what we did when Europe</p>
<p>and when Great Britain was in the face of a Nazi invasion.</p>
<p>We signed the same thing into motion.</p>
<p>Do you know that the UK did not pay off the debt</p>
<p>from World War II until 2020?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been paying that debt since the end of World War II.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re doing is we&rsquo;re indebting Ukraine</p>
<p>against the promise that perhaps</p>
<p>they will secure their freedom,</p>
<p>which nobody seems to wanna talk about</p>
<p>what freedom is actually gonna look like for Ukrainians.</p>
<p>What are the true handful of outcomes,</p>
<p>the realistic outcomes that could come of this</p>
<p>and which of those outcomes really looks like freedom</p>
<p>to them, especially in the face of the fact</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to be trillions of dollars in debt</p>
<p>to the West for supplying them with the training</p>
<p>and the weapons and the food and the med kits</p>
<p>and everything else that we&rsquo;re giving them</p>
<p>because none of it&rsquo;s free.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all coming due.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a democracy, but we&rsquo;re also a capitalist country.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t afford to just give things away for free,</p>
<p>but we can give things away at a discount.</p>
<p>We can give things away, lay away,</p>
<p>but the bill will come due.</p>
<p>And unfortunately that is not part of the conversation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being had with the American people.</p>
<p>So debt is a way to establish some level of control.</p>
<p>Power is power.</p>
<p>That said, having a very close relationship</p>
<p>between Ukraine and the United States</p>
<p>does not seem to be a negative possibility</p>
<p>when the Ukrainians think about their future</p>
<p>in terms of freedom.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one thing.</p>
<p>And the other, there&rsquo;s some aspect of this war</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve just noticed that one of the people I talked to</p>
<p>said that all great nations have a independence war,</p>
<p>have to have a war for their independence.</p>
<p>In order, there&rsquo;s something, it&rsquo;s dark,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something about war just being a catalyst</p>
<p>for finding your own identity as a nation.</p>
<p>So you can have leaders, you can have sort of</p>
<p>signed documents, you can have all this kind of stuff,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something about war</p>
<p>that really brings the country together</p>
<p>and actually try to figure out what is at the core</p>
<p>of the spirit of the people that defines this country.</p>
<p>And they see this war as that,</p>
<p>as the independence war to define the heart</p>
<p>of what the country is.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s been before the war, before this invasion,</p>
<p>there was a lot of factions in the country.</p>
<p>There was a lot of influence from oligarchs</p>
<p>and corruption and so on.</p>
<p>A lot of that was the factions were brought together</p>
<p>under one umbrella effectively to become one nation</p>
<p>because of this invasion.</p>
<p>So they see that as a positive direction</p>
<p>for the defining of what a free democratic country</p>
<p>looks like after the war,</p>
<p>in their perspective after the war is won.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a difficult situation because I&rsquo;m trying to make sure</p>
<p>that you and all, everybody listening understands</p>
<p>that what&rsquo;s happening in Ukraine, among Ukrainians,</p>
<p>is noble and brave and courageous</p>
<p>and beyond the expectations of anyone.</p>
<p>The fact is there is no material support</p>
<p>coming from the outside.</p>
<p>The American Revolution was won</p>
<p>because of French involvement.</p>
<p>French ships, French troops, French generals,</p>
<p>French military might.</p>
<p>The independence of communist China was won</p>
<p>through Russian support, Russian generals,</p>
<p>Russian troops on the ground fighting with the communists.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how revolutions are won.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how independent countries are born.</p>
<p>Ukraine doesn&rsquo;t get any of that.</p>
<p>No one is stepping into that</p>
<p>because we live in a world right now</p>
<p>where there simply is no economic benefits</p>
<p>to the parties in power to support Ukraine to that level.</p>
<p>And war is a game of economics.</p>
<p>The economic benefit of Ukraine is crystal clear</p>
<p>in favor of Russia, which is why Putin cannot lose.</p>
<p>He will not let himself lose.</p>
<p>Short of something completely unexpected, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking 60%, 70% probability, Ukraine loses.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s still 20%, 30% probability</p>
<p>of the unimaginable happening.</p>
<p>Who knows what that might be?</p>
<p>An oligarch assassinates Putin</p>
<p>or a nuclear bomb goes off somewhere</p>
<p>or who knows what, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a chance</p>
<p>that something unexpected will happen</p>
<p>and change the tide of the war.</p>
<p>But when it comes down to the core calculus here,</p>
<p>Ukraine is the agricultural bed to support a future Russia.</p>
<p>Russia knows, they know they have to have Ukraine.</p>
<p>They know that they have to have it to protect themselves</p>
<p>against military pressure from the West.</p>
<p>They have to have it for agricultural reasons.</p>
<p>They have major oil and natural gas pipelines</p>
<p>that flow through Eastern Ukraine.</p>
<p>They cannot let Ukraine fall</p>
<p>outside of their sphere of influence.</p>
<p>They cannot.</p>
<p>The United States doesn&rsquo;t really have</p>
<p>any economic vested interest in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Ideological points of view and promises aside,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no economic benefit.</p>
<p>And the same thing goes for NATO.</p>
<p>NATO has no economic investment in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Ukrainian output, Ukrainian food</p>
<p>goes to the Middle East and Africa.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t go to Europe.</p>
<p>So the whole, the West siding with Ukraine</p>
<p>is exclusively ideological</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s putting them in a place</p>
<p>where they fight a war with Russia</p>
<p>so the whole world can see Russia&rsquo;s capabilities.</p>
<p>Ukraine is a, as sad as it is to say, man,</p>
<p>Ukraine is a pawn on a table for superpowers</p>
<p>to calculate each other&rsquo;s capacities.</p>
<p>Right now we&rsquo;ve only talked about Russia and the United States.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t even talked about Iran.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t even talked about China, right?</p>
<p>It is a pawn on a table.</p>
<p>This is a chicken fight so that people get to watch</p>
<p>and see what the other trainers are doing.</p>
<p>Well, a lot of people might&rsquo;ve said the same thing</p>
<p>about the United States back in the independence fight.</p>
<p>So there is possibilities, as you&rsquo;ve said.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not saying a 0% chance</p>
<p>and it could be a reasonably high percent chance</p>
<p>that this becomes one of the great democratic nations</p>
<p>that the 21st century is remembered by.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And so you said American support.</p>
<p>So ideologically, first of all,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t assign much longterm power to that.</p>
<p>That US could support Ukraine</p>
<p>purely on ideological grounds.</p>
<p>Just look in the last four years, the last three years.</p>
<p>Do you remember what happened in Hong Kong</p>
<p>right before COVID?</p>
<p>China swooped into Hong Kong violently,</p>
<p>beating protesters, killing them in the street,</p>
<p>imprisoning people without just cause.</p>
<p>And Hong Kong was a democracy</p>
<p>and the whole world stood by and let it happen.</p>
<p>And then what happened in Afghanistan just a year ago</p>
<p>and the whole world stood by</p>
<p>and let the Taliban take power again</p>
<p>after 20 years of loss.</p>
<p>This, we are showing a repeatable point of view.</p>
<p>We will talk.</p>
<p>American politicians, American administrations,</p>
<p>we will say a lot of things.</p>
<p>We will promise a lot of ideological pro democracy,</p>
<p>rah rah statements.</p>
<p>We will say it.</p>
<p>But when it comes down to putting our own people,</p>
<p>our own economy, our own GDP at risk,</p>
<p>we step away from that fight.</p>
<p>America is currently supplying</p>
<p>military equipment to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And a lot of that military equipment</p>
<p>has actually been the thing that turned</p>
<p>the tides of war a couple of times already.</p>
<p>Currently that&rsquo;s the high mar systems.</p>
<p>So you mentioned sort of Putin can&rsquo;t afford to lose,</p>
<p>but winning can look in different ways.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve kind of defined so on.</p>
<p>At this moment, the prediction is that winning</p>
<p>looks like capturing not just the east,</p>
<p>but the south of Ukraine.</p>
<p>But you can have narratives of winning</p>
<p>that return back to what was at the beginning of this year</p>
<p>before the invasion.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>That Crimea is still with Russia.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some kind of negotiated thing about Donbass</p>
<p>where it still stays with Ukraine,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some.</p>
<p>Puppet government.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just like that&rsquo;s what they have in Georgia right now.</p>
<p>And that could still be defined through mechanisms.</p>
<p>As Russia winning.</p>
<p>As Russia winning for Russia and then for Ukraine</p>
<p>as Ukraine winning and for the west as democracy winning</p>
<p>and you kind of negotiate.</p>
<p>I mean, that seems to be how geopolitics works</p>
<p>is everybody can walk away with a win win story</p>
<p>and then the world progresses with the lessons learned.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the high likely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most probable outcome.</p>
<p>The most probable outcome is that Ukraine remains</p>
<p>in air quotes, a sovereign nation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to be truly sovereign</p>
<p>because it will become,</p>
<p>it will have to have new government put in place.</p>
<p>Zelinsky will, it&rsquo;s extremely unlikely he will be president</p>
<p>because he has gone too far to demonstrate his power</p>
<p>over the people and his ability to separate</p>
<p>the Ukrainian people from the autocratic power of Russia.</p>
<p>So he would have to be unseated whether he goes into exile</p>
<p>or whether he is peacefully left alone</p>
<p>is all gonna be part of negotiations.</p>
<p>But the thing to keep in mind also is that</p>
<p>a negotiated peace really just means a negotiated ceasefire.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen this happen all over the world.</p>
<p>North Korea and South Korea are technically still</p>
<p>just in negotiated cease power.</p>
<p>What you end up having is Russia will allow Ukraine</p>
<p>to call itself Ukraine, to operate independently,</p>
<p>to have their own debt to the United States.</p>
<p>Russia doesn&rsquo;t wanna take on that debt.</p>
<p>And then in exchange for that,</p>
<p>they will have firmer guidelines</p>
<p>as to how NATO can engage with Ukraine.</p>
<p>And then that becomes an example</p>
<p>for all the other former Soviet satellite states,</p>
<p>which are all required economically by Russia,</p>
<p>not required economically by the West.</p>
<p>And then you end up seeing how it just,</p>
<p>you can see how the whole thing plays out</p>
<p>once you realize that the keystone is Ukraine.</p>
<p>There is something about Ukraine,</p>
<p>the deep support by the Ukrainian people of America</p>
<p>that is in contrast with, for example, Afghanistan,</p>
<p>that it seems like ideologically,</p>
<p>Ukraine could be a beacon of freedom</p>
<p>used in narratives by the United States</p>
<p>to fight geopolitical wars in that part of the world,</p>
<p>that they would be a good partner</p>
<p>for this idea of democracy, of freedom,</p>
<p>of all the values that America stands for.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a good partner.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s valuable,</p>
<p>if you sort of have a cynical, pragmatic view,</p>
<p>sort of like Henry Kissinger type of view,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s valuable to have them as a partner,</p>
<p>so valuable that it makes sense to support them</p>
<p>in achieving a negotiated ceasefire</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s on the side of Ukraine.</p>
<p>But because of this particular leader,</p>
<p>this particular culture,</p>
<p>this particular dynamics of how the war unrolled</p>
<p>and things like Twitter</p>
<p>and the way digital communication currently works,</p>
<p>it just seems like this is a powerful symbol of freedom</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s useful for the United States</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re sort of to take the pragmatic view.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>that United States supports Ukraine</p>
<p>financially, militarily enough</p>
<p>for it to get an advantage in this war?</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;ve already gotten advantage in the war.</p>
<p>The fact that the war is still going on</p>
<p>demonstrates the asymmetrical advantage.</p>
<p>The fact that Russia has stepped up</p>
<p>to the negotiating table with them several times</p>
<p>without just turning to Chechen,</p>
<p>I mean, you remember what happened in Chechnya,</p>
<p>without turning to Chechnya level,</p>
<p>just mass blind destruction,</p>
<p>which was another Putin war.</p>
<p>To see that those things have happened</p>
<p>demonstrates the asymmetric advantage</p>
<p>that the West has given.</p>
<p>I think the true way to look at the benefit of Ukraine</p>
<p>as a shining example of freedom in Europe for the West</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t to understand whether or not they could.</p>
<p>They absolutely could.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the question of how valuable is that in Europe?</p>
<p>How valuable is Ukraine?</p>
<p>Which before February, nobody even thought about Ukraine.</p>
<p>And the people who did know about Ukraine</p>
<p>knew that it was an extremely corrupt former Soviet state</p>
<p>with 20% of its national population</p>
<p>self identifying as Russian.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason Putin went into Ukraine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason he&rsquo;s been promising</p>
<p>he would go into Ukraine for the better part of a decade.</p>
<p>Because the circumstances were aligned,</p>
<p>it was a corrupt country that self identified</p>
<p>as Russian in many ways.</p>
<p>It was supposed to be an easier of multiple marks</p>
<p>in terms of the former Soviet satellite states to go after.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all part of the miscalculation</p>
<p>that the rest of the world saw too</p>
<p>when we thought it would fall quickly.</p>
<p>So to think that it could be a shining example of freedom</p>
<p>is accurate.</p>
<p>But is it as shining a star as Germany?</p>
<p>Is it as shining a star as the UK?</p>
<p>Is it as shining a star as Romania?</p>
<p>Is it as shiny a star as France?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a lot of democratic freedom based countries</p>
<p>in Europe to compete against</p>
<p>to be the shining stellar example.</p>
<p>And in exchange, on counterpoint to that,</p>
<p>it has an extreme amount of strategic value to Russia</p>
<p>which has no interest in making it a shining star</p>
<p>of the example of democracy and freedom.</p>
<p>Outside of research in terms of the shininess of the star,</p>
<p>I would argue yes.</p>
<p>If you look at how much it captivated</p>
<p>the attention of the world.</p>
<p>The attention of the world</p>
<p>has made no material difference, man.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your estimation, but are you sure we can,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t, if you can convert that into political influence</p>
<p>into money, don&rsquo;t you think attention is money?</p>
<p>Attention is money in democracies and capitalist countries.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Which serves as a counterweight</p>
<p>to sort of authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>So for Putin, resources matter.</p>
<p>For the United States, also resources matter,</p>
<p>but the attention and the belief of the people also matter</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how you attain and maintain political power.</p>
<p>So going to that exact example,</p>
<p>then I would highlight that our current administration</p>
<p>has the lowest approval ratings of any president in history.</p>
<p>So if people were very fond of the war going on in Ukraine,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t that counterbalance some of our upset,</p>
<p>some of the dissent coming from the economy</p>
<p>and some of the dissent coming from the great recession</p>
<p>or the second great, or the great resignation</p>
<p>and whatever&rsquo;s happening with the draw</p>
<p>with the down stock market?</p>
<p>You would think that people would feel</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re sacrificing for something</p>
<p>if they really believed that Ukraine mattered,</p>
<p>that they would stand next to the president</p>
<p>who is so staunchly driving and leading the West</p>
<p>against this conflict.</p>
<p>Well, I think the opposition to this particular president,</p>
<p>I personally believe has less to do with the policies</p>
<p>and more to do with a lot of the other human factors.</p>
<p>But again, empirically, this is,</p>
<p>I look at things through a very empirical lens,</p>
<p>a very cold fact based lens.</p>
<p>And there are multiple data points that suggest</p>
<p>that the American people ideologically sympathize</p>
<p>with Ukraine, but they really just want</p>
<p>their gas prices to go down.</p>
<p>They really just want to be able to pay less money</p>
<p>at the grocery store for their food.</p>
<p>And they most definitely don&rsquo;t want their sons</p>
<p>and daughters to die in exchange for Ukrainian freedom.</p>
<p>It does hurt me to see the politicization</p>
<p>of this war as well.</p>
<p>I think that maybe has to do with the kind of calculation</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re referring to, but it seems like it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s a cynical,</p>
<p>whatever takes attention of the media for the moment,</p>
<p>the red team chooses one side</p>
<p>and the blue team chooses another.</p>
<p>And then I think, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>but I believe the Democrats went into full support</p>
<p>of Ukraine on the ideological side.</p>
<p>And then I guess Republicans are saying,</p>
<p>why are we wasting money?</p>
<p>The gas prices are going up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very crude kind of analysis,</p>
<p>but they basically picked whatever argument</p>
<p>on whatever side, and now more and more and more,</p>
<p>this particular war in Ukraine is becoming</p>
<p>a kind of pawn in the game of politics</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s first the midterm elections,</p>
<p>then building up towards the presidential elections,</p>
<p>and stops being about the philosophical, the social,</p>
<p>the geopolitical aspects, parameters of this war,</p>
<p>and more about just like whatever the heck</p>
<p>captivates Twitter, and we&rsquo;re gonna use that for politics.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right in the sense of the fact that it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say that the red team and the blue team</p>
<p>picked opposite sides on this.</p>
<p>What I would say is that media discovered</p>
<p>that talking about Ukraine wasn&rsquo;t as profitable</p>
<p>as talking about something else.</p>
<p>People simply, the American people who read media</p>
<p>or who watch media, they simply became bored</p>
<p>reading about news that didn&rsquo;t seem to be changing much.</p>
<p>And we turned back into wanting to read</p>
<p>about our own economy, and we wanted to hear more</p>
<p>about cryptocurrency, and we wanted to hear more</p>
<p>about the Kardashians, and that&rsquo;s what we care about,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s what media writes about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how a capitalist market driven world works,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how the United States works.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why in both red papers and blue papers,</p>
<p>red sources and blue sources,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t see Ukraine being mentioned very much.</p>
<p>If anything, I would say that your Republicans</p>
<p>are probably more in support of what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in Ukraine right now, because we&rsquo;re creating</p>
<p>new weapon systems, our military is getting stronger,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re sending these, we get to test military systems</p>
<p>in combat in Ukraine, that&rsquo;s priceless.</p>
<p>In the world of the military industrial complex,</p>
<p>being able to field test, combat test a weapon</p>
<p>without having to sacrifice your own people</p>
<p>is incredibly valuable.</p>
<p>You get all the data, you get all the performance metrics,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have to put yourself at risk.</p>
<p>That is one of the major benefits of what we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>from supporting Ukraine with weapons and with troops.</p>
<p>The longterm benefit to what will come of this</p>
<p>for the United States, practically speaking,</p>
<p>in the lens of national security,</p>
<p>through military readiness,</p>
<p>through future economic benefits, those are super strong.</p>
<p>The geopolitical fight is essentially moot,</p>
<p>because Ukraine is not a geopolitical player.</p>
<p>It was not for 70 years, and after this conflict is over,</p>
<p>it will not again.</p>
<p>Just think about what you were just saying</p>
<p>with the American people&rsquo;s attention span</p>
<p>to Twitter and whatever&rsquo;s currently going on.</p>
<p>If the Ukraine conflict resolved itself today</p>
<p>in any direction, how many weeks do you think</p>
<p>before no one talked about Ukraine anymore?</p>
<p>Do you think we would make it two weeks?</p>
<p>Or do you think we&rsquo;d make it maybe seven days?</p>
<p>It would be headline news for one or two days,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;d be onto something else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just an unfortunate reality</p>
<p>of how the world works in a capitalist democracy.</p>
<p>Yeah, it just breaks my heart how much,</p>
<p>you know, I know that there&rsquo;s Yemen and Syria</p>
<p>and that nobody talks about anymore.</p>
<p>Still raging conflicts going on.</p>
<p>It breaks my heart how much generational hatred is born.</p>
<p>I happen to be from, my family is from Ukraine</p>
<p>and from Russia, and so for me, just personally,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a part of the world I care about.</p>
<p>In terms of its history, because I speak the language,</p>
<p>I can appreciate the beauty of the literature,</p>
<p>the music, the art, the cultural history</p>
<p>of the 20th century through all the dark times,</p>
<p>through all the hell of the dark sides</p>
<p>of authoritarian regimes, the destruction of war.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still just the beauty that I&rsquo;m able to appreciate</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t appreciate about China, Brazil,</p>
<p>other countries because I don&rsquo;t speak their language.</p>
<p>This one I can appreciate.</p>
<p>And so in that way, this is personally really painful to me</p>
<p>to see so much of that history, the beauty in that history</p>
<p>suffocated by the hatred that is born</p>
<p>through this kind of geopolitical game</p>
<p>fought mostly by the politicians, the leaders.</p>
<p>People are beautiful, and that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>People are just, people are beautiful creatures.</p>
<p>Culture and art and science,</p>
<p>these are beautiful, beautiful things</p>
<p>that come about because of human beings.</p>
<p>And the thing that gives me hope is that</p>
<p>no matter what conflict the world has seen,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve seen some devastating,</p>
<p>horrible crimes against humanity already.</p>
<p>We saw nuclear bombs go off in Japan.</p>
<p>We saw genocide happen in Rwanda.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen horrible things happen.</p>
<p>But people persevere.</p>
<p>Language, culture, arts, science, they all persevere.</p>
<p>They all shine through.</p>
<p>Some of the most, people don&rsquo;t even realize</p>
<p>how gorgeous the architecture and the culture is</p>
<p>inside Iran.</p>
<p>People have no idea.</p>
<p>Chinese people in the rural parts of China</p>
<p>are some of the kindest, most amazing people</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll ever meet.</p>
<p>And Korean art and Korean dance, Korean drumming,</p>
<p>I know nobody has ever even heard of Korean drumming.</p>
<p>Korean drumming is this magical, beautiful thing.</p>
<p>And the North, in North Korea, does it better</p>
<p>than anybody in the world.</p>
<p>Taekwondo in North Korea is just exceptional to watch.</p>
<p>In North Korea?</p>
<p>In North Korea.</p>
<p>Nobody knows these things.</p>
<p>How do you know about Taekwondo in North Korea?</p>
<p>I have questions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, people don&rsquo;t think about that,</p>
<p>but the culture, the beauty of the people</p>
<p>still flourishes even in the toughest of places.</p>
<p>Absolutely, and we always will.</p>
<p>We always will because that is what people do.</p>
<p>And that is just the truth of it.</p>
<p>And it breaks my heart to see travesties</p>
<p>that people commit against people.</p>
<p>But whether you&rsquo;re looking at a micro level,</p>
<p>like what happens with shootings here in the United States,</p>
<p>or whether you look at a macro level,</p>
<p>like geopolitical power exchanges</p>
<p>and intra and interstate conflicts,</p>
<p>like what you see in Syria and what you see in Ukraine,</p>
<p>those are disgusting, terrible things.</p>
<p>War is a terrible thing.</p>
<p>That is a famous quote.</p>
<p>But people will persevere.</p>
<p>People will come through.</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>And I hope we don&rsquo;t do something</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll probably also ask you about later on</p>
<p>is things that destroy the possibility of perseverance,</p>
<p>which is things like nuclear war,</p>
<p>things that can do such tremendous damage</p>
<p>that we will never recover.</p>
<p>But yeah, amidst your pragmatic pessimism,</p>
<p>I think both you and I have a kind of</p>
<p>maybe small flame of optimism in there</p>
<p>about the perseverance of the human species in general.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about intelligence agencies</p>
<p>outside of the CIA.</p>
<p>Can you illuminate what is the most powerful</p>
<p>intelligence agency in the world?</p>
<p>The CIA, the FSB, formerly the KGB, the MI6, Mossad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to interact with a lot of Israelis</p>
<p>while in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Just incredible people.</p>
<p>Yeah, in terms of both training and skill,</p>
<p>just every front.</p>
<p>American soldiers too, just American military is incredible.</p>
<p>I just, the competence and skill of the military,</p>
<p>the United States, Israeli I got to interact,</p>
<p>and Ukrainian as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s striking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s striking, it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>I just love people, I love carpenters,</p>
<p>or people that are just extremely good at their job</p>
<p>and then take pride in their craftsmanship.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful to see.</p>
<p>And I imagine the same kind of thing happens</p>
<p>inside of intelligence agencies as well</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t get to appreciate because of the secrecy.</p>
<p>Same thing with like Lockheed Martin.</p>
<p>I interviewed the CTO of Lockheed Martin.</p>
<p>It breaks my heart, as a person who loves engineering,</p>
<p>because of the cover of secrecy,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll never get to know some of the incredible engineering</p>
<p>that happens inside of Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Raytheon.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, there&rsquo;s kind of this idea</p>
<p>that these are, you know, people have conspiracy theories</p>
<p>and kind of assign evil to these companies in some part,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s beautiful people inside those companies,</p>
<p>brilliant people, and some incredible science</p>
<p>and engineering is happening there.</p>
<p>Anyway, that said, the CIA, the FSB, the MI6,</p>
<p>Mossad, China, I know very little about the&hellip;</p>
<p>MSS, the Ministry of State Security.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much you know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or just other intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>In India, Pakistan, I&rsquo;ve also heard&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, RAW is powerful, and so is ISSI.</p>
<p>Yes, or ISSI.</p>
<p>And then, of course, European nations in Germany and France.</p>
<p>Yeah, so what can you say about the power,</p>
<p>the influence of the different intelligence agencies</p>
<p>within their nation and outside?</p>
<p>Yeah, so to answer your question, your original question,</p>
<p>which is the most powerful,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to give you a few different answers.</p>
<p>So the most powerful intelligence organization in the world</p>
<p>in terms of reach is the Chinese MSS,</p>
<p>the Ministry of State Security,</p>
<p>because they have created</p>
<p>a single, solitary intelligence service</p>
<p>that has global reach and is integrated</p>
<p>with Chinese culture, so that essentially,</p>
<p>every Chinese person anywhere in the world</p>
<p>is an informant to the MSS,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s their way of serving the Middle Kingdom,</p>
<p>Zhongguo, the Central Kingdom, the Chinese word for China.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re the strongest.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the most powerful intelligence service</p>
<p>in terms of reach.</p>
<p>Most assets, most informants, most intelligence.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s deeply integrated with the citizenry.</p>
<p>Correct, with their culture.</p>
<p>You know what a Chinese person who lives in Syria</p>
<p>thinks of themself as?</p>
<p>A Chinese person.</p>
<p>Do you know what a Chinese person,</p>
<p>a Chinese national living in the United States</p>
<p>thinks of themself as?</p>
<p>A Chinese person, right?</p>
<p>Americans living abroad often think of ourselves</p>
<p>as expats, expatriates, living on the local economy,</p>
<p>embracing the local culture.</p>
<p>That is not how Chinese people view</p>
<p>traveling around the world.</p>
<p>And by the way, if I may mention,</p>
<p>I believe the way Mossad operates</p>
<p>is a similar kind of thing,</p>
<p>because people from Israel living abroad</p>
<p>still think of themselves as Jewish and Israeli.</p>
<p>First.</p>
<p>First, so that allows you to integrate the.</p>
<p>Culture, and yep, the faith based aspects.</p>
<p>Exactly right.</p>
<p>But the number of people in Israel is much, much smaller.</p>
<p>Exactly right.</p>
<p>The number of people in China.</p>
<p>When it comes to reach, China wins that game.</p>
<p>When it comes to professional capability,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the CIA by far, because budget wise,</p>
<p>capability wise, weapons system wise,</p>
<p>modern technology wise,</p>
<p>CIA is the leader around the world,</p>
<p>which is why every other intelligence organization out there</p>
<p>wants to partner with CIA.</p>
<p>They want to learn from CIA.</p>
<p>They want to train with CIA.</p>
<p>They want to partner on counter narcotics,</p>
<p>and counter drug, and counter terrorism,</p>
<p>and counter Uyghur, you name it,</p>
<p>people want to partner with CIA.</p>
<p>So CIA is the most powerful</p>
<p>in terms of capability and wealth.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got the idea, you&rsquo;ve got tech.</p>
<p>So tech alone, meaning corporate espionage,</p>
<p>economic espionage, nothing beats DGSE in France.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the top.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got a massive budget</p>
<p>that almost goes exclusively to stealing foreign secrets.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the biggest threat to the United States,</p>
<p>even above Russia and above China.</p>
<p>DGSE in France</p>
<p>is a massively powerful intelligence organization,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re so exclusively focused</p>
<p>on a handful of types of intelligence collection</p>
<p>that nobody even really thinks that they exist.</p>
<p>And then in terms of just terrifying violence,</p>
<p>you have Mossad.</p>
<p>Mossad will do anything.</p>
<p>Mossad has no qualms doing what it takes</p>
<p>to ensure the survival</p>
<p>of every Israeli citizen around the world.</p>
<p>Most other countries will stop at some point,</p>
<p>but Mossad doesn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the lines you&rsquo;re willing to cross.</p>
<p>And the reasons that you&rsquo;re willing to cross them.</p>
<p>The CIA will let an American stay in jail in Russia,</p>
<p>unlawfully, and seek a diplomatic solution.</p>
<p>I mean, the United States has let people,</p>
<p>there are two gentlemen from the 1950s</p>
<p>who were imprisoned in China for 20 years</p>
<p>waiting for diplomatic solutions to their release.</p>
<p>So we do not kill to save a citizen, but Mossad will.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ll not just kill,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll do large scale infiltration.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll do amazing things.</p>
<p>There is no, they spare no expense</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a demonstration to their own people.</p>
<p>Again, going back to the whole idea of influence.</p>
<p>Every intelligence operation that sees the light of day</p>
<p>has two purposes.</p>
<p>The first purpose is the intelligence operation.</p>
<p>But if it was just the intelligence operation,</p>
<p>it would stay secret forever.</p>
<p>The second purpose</p>
<p>of every successful intelligence operation,</p>
<p>when they become public,</p>
<p>is to send a signal to the world.</p>
<p>If you work against us, we will do this to you.</p>
<p>If you work for us, we will take care of you in this way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a massive information campaign.</p>
<p>Do you think in that way, CIA is not doing a good job?</p>
<p>Because there is the FSB, perhaps much less so GRU,</p>
<p>but the KGB did this well,</p>
<p>which is to send a signal, like basically communicate</p>
<p>that this is a terrifying organization with a lot of power.</p>
<p>So Mossad is doing a good job of that.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>The psychological information warfare.</p>
<p>And it seems like the CIA also has a lot of kind of myths</p>
<p>about it, conspiracy theories about it,</p>
<p>but much less so than the other agencies.</p>
<p>CIA does a good job of playing to the mythos.</p>
<p>So when General Petraeus used to be the director of CIA.</p>
<p>Yeah, and your workout partner.</p>
<p>And my workout partner.</p>
<p>I read about this.</p>
<p>So I loved and hated those workouts with Petraeus</p>
<p>because he is a physical beast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a strong fit, at the time, 60 something year old man.</p>
<p>Let me take a tangent on that because he&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>on this podcast.</p>
<p>Oh, excellent man.</p>
<p>So can you say what you learned from the man</p>
<p>in terms of, or like what you think is interesting</p>
<p>and powerful and inspiring about the way he sees the world,</p>
<p>or maybe what you learned in terms of how to get strong</p>
<p>in the gym or anything about life.</p>
<p>Two things right away.</p>
<p>And one of them I was gonna share with you anyway.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m glad that you asked the question.</p>
<p>So the first is that on our runs and man, he runs fast</p>
<p>and we would go for six mile runs through Bangkok.</p>
<p>And he talked openly about, I asked him,</p>
<p>how do you keep this mystery, this epic mythology</p>
<p>about your fitness and your strength?</p>
<p>How do you keep all of this alive with the troops?</p>
<p>And he had this amazing answer.</p>
<p>And he was like, I don&rsquo;t talk about it.</p>
<p>Myths are born not from somebody orchestrating the myth,</p>
<p>but from the source of the myth, simply being secretive.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t talk about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never talked about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never exacerbated it.</p>
<p>I just do what I do.</p>
<p>And I let the troops talk.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, when it&rsquo;s in favor, when it goes in favor</p>
<p>of discipline and loyalty and commitment, I let it run.</p>
<p>If it starts getting destructive or damaging,</p>
<p>then I have my leadership team step in to fix it.</p>
<p>But when it comes to the mythos,</p>
<p>the myth of him being superpowered soldier,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what he wants every soldier to be.</p>
<p>So he lets it run.</p>
<p>And it was so enlightening when he told me,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a myth that benefits you, you just let it go.</p>
<p>You let it happen because it gets you further</p>
<p>without you doing any work.</p>
<p>It costs no investment for you.</p>
<p>So the catalyst of the virality of the myth</p>
<p>is just being mysterious.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what CIA does well,</p>
<p>to go back to your first question.</p>
<p>What does CIA do?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t answer any questions.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>And wherever the myth goes, the myth goes,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s that they sold drugs</p>
<p>or use child prostitutes or whatever else,</p>
<p>wherever the myth goes, they let it go.</p>
<p>Because at the end of the day,</p>
<p>everybody sits back and says, wow, I really just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Now, the second thing that I learned from Petraeus,</p>
<p>and I really am a big fan of Petraeus.</p>
<p>I know he made personal mistakes.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get to be that powerful</p>
<p>without making personal mistakes.</p>
<p>But when I worked out with him,</p>
<p>the one thing that my commanding officer</p>
<p>told me not to ask about,</p>
<p>he was like, never ask the general about his family.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a family guy.</p>
<p>So as soon as I met General Petraeus,</p>
<p>one of the first things I asked him was,</p>
<p>hey, what was it like raising a family</p>
<p>and being the commander of forces in the Middle East?</p>
<p>Like you weren&rsquo;t with your family very much.</p>
<p>And the thing I love about the guy,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t bite off my head.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t snap at me.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>He openly admitted that he regretted</p>
<p>some of the decisions that he made</p>
<p>because he had to sacrifice his family to get there.</p>
<p>Relationships with his children,</p>
<p>absentee father, missing birthdays,</p>
<p>missing, we all say, we all say how sad it is</p>
<p>to miss birthdays and miss anniversaries,</p>
<p>yada, yada, yada.</p>
<p>Everybody knows what that feels like.</p>
<p>Even business people know what that feels like.</p>
<p>The actual pain that we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is when you&rsquo;re not there to handle</p>
<p>your 13 year old&rsquo;s questions when a boy breaks up with her</p>
<p>or when you&rsquo;re not there to handle the bloody lip</p>
<p>that your nine year old comes back with</p>
<p>from their first encounter with a bully.</p>
<p>Those are the truly heartbreaking moments</p>
<p>that a parent lives and dies by.</p>
<p>He missed almost all of those</p>
<p>because he was fighting a war that we forgot</p>
<p>and we gave up on 20 years later, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so honest about that.</p>
<p>And it was really inspiring to me</p>
<p>to be told not to ask that question.</p>
<p>And when I broke that guidance, he didn&rsquo;t reprimand me.</p>
<p>He just, he was authentic.</p>
<p>And it was absolutely one of the big decisions</p>
<p>that helped me leave CIA on my own in 2014.</p>
<p>And he was honest on the sacrifice you make.</p>
<p>The same man, the same man who just taught me a lesson</p>
<p>about letting a myth live,</p>
<p>that same guy was willing to be so authentic</p>
<p>about this personal mistake.</p>
<p>I like complicated people like that.</p>
<p>So what did you, what do you make of that calculation,</p>
<p>of family versus job?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve given a lot of your life and passion</p>
<p>to the CIA, to that work.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve spoken positively about that world, the good it does.</p>
<p>And yet you&rsquo;re also a family man and you value that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that calculation like?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that trade off like?</p>
<p>I mean, for me, the calculation is very clear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>I left CIA because I chose my family.</p>
<p>And when my son was born, my wife and I found out</p>
<p>that we were pregnant while we were still on mission.</p>
<p>We were a tandem couple.</p>
<p>My wife is also a former CIA officer, undercover like me.</p>
<p>We were operating together overseas.</p>
<p>We got the positive pregnancy test, like so many people do.</p>
<p>And she cried.</p>
<p>My wife was a bad ass.</p>
<p>I was just, I was like the accidental spy,</p>
<p>but my wife was really good at what she does.</p>
<p>And she cried and she was like, what do we do now?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve always wanted, a child,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re in this thing right now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no space for a child.</p>
<p>So long story short, we had our baby.</p>
<p>CIA brought us back to have the baby.</p>
<p>And when we started having conversations about,</p>
<p>hey, what do we do next?</p>
<p>Cause we&rsquo;re not the type of people</p>
<p>to wanna just sit around and be domestic.</p>
<p>What do we do next?</p>
<p>But keep in mind, we have a child now.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s some of our suggestions.</p>
<p>We could do this and we can do that.</p>
<p>Let us get our child to a place where we can put him</p>
<p>into an international school,</p>
<p>or we can get him into some sort of program</p>
<p>where we can both operate together again during the day.</p>
<p>But CIA just had no,</p>
<p>they had no patience for that conversation.</p>
<p>There was no, family is not their priority.</p>
<p>So the fact that we were a tandem couple,</p>
<p>two officers, two operators trying to have a baby</p>
<p>was irrelevant to them.</p>
<p>So when they didn&rsquo;t play with us,</p>
<p>when they did nothing to help us prioritize parenthood</p>
<p>as part of our overall experience,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when we knew that they never would.</p>
<p>And what good is it to commit yourself to a career</p>
<p>if the career is always going to challenge</p>
<p>the thing that you value most?</p>
<p>And that was the calculation that we made to leave CIA.</p>
<p>Not everybody makes that calculation.</p>
<p>And a big part of why I am so vocal about my time in CIA</p>
<p>is because I am immensely appreciative of the men and women</p>
<p>who to this day have failed marriages</p>
<p>and poor relationships with their children</p>
<p>because they chose national security.</p>
<p>They chose protecting America over their own family.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve done it even though it&rsquo;s made them</p>
<p>abuse alcohol and abuse substances</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve gotten themselves,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got permanent diseases and issues</p>
<p>from living and working abroad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just insane the sacrifice that officers make</p>
<p>to keep America free.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just not one of those people.</p>
<p>I chose family.</p>
<p>You said that your wife misses it.</p>
<p>Do you miss it?</p>
<p>We both miss it.</p>
<p>We miss it for different reasons.</p>
<p>We miss it for similar reasons, I guess,</p>
<p>but we miss it in different ways.</p>
<p>The people, the people at CIA are just amazing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re everyday people like the guy and the gal next door,</p>
<p>but so smart and so dedicated and so courageous</p>
<p>about what they do and how they do it.</p>
<p>I mean, the sacrifices they make are massive,</p>
<p>more massive than the sacrifices I made.</p>
<p>So I was always inspired</p>
<p>and impressed by the people around me.</p>
<p>So both my wife and I absolutely miss the people.</p>
<p>My wife misses the work because you know everything.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re inside, it&rsquo;s all, I mean, we had top secret.</p>
<p>We had TS SCI clearances at the time.</p>
<p>I had a cat six, cat 12, which makes me nuclear cleared.</p>
<p>My wife had other privy clearances</p>
<p>that allowed her to look into areas that were specialized,</p>
<p>but there wasn&rsquo;t a headline that went out</p>
<p>that we couldn&rsquo;t fact check with a click of a few buttons.</p>
<p>And she misses that because she loved that kind of knowledge.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re just one of us living</p>
<p>in the cloud of mystery.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Not really knowing anything about what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Exactly, but for me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been the person that likes operating.</p>
<p>And you know what you still get to do when you leave CIA?</p>
<p>You still get to operate.</p>
<p>Operating is just working with people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s understanding how people think,</p>
<p>predicting their actions,</p>
<p>driving their direction of their thoughts, persuading them,</p>
<p>winning negotiations.</p>
<p>You still get to do that.</p>
<p>You do that every day.</p>
<p>And you can apply that in all kinds of domains.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you on that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a covert CIA intelligence officer for several years.</p>
<p>Maybe can you tell me the story of how it all began?</p>
<p>How were you recruited?</p>
<p>And what did the job entail</p>
<p>to the degree you can speak about it?</p>
<p>Feel free to direct me if I&rsquo;m getting too boring</p>
<p>or if the camera.</p>
<p>Every aspect of this is super exciting.</p>
<p>So I was leaving the United States Air Force in 2007.</p>
<p>I was a lieutenant getting ready to pin on captain.</p>
<p>My five years was up.</p>
<p>And I was a very bad fit for the US Air Force.</p>
<p>I was an Air Force Academy graduate, not by choice,</p>
<p>but by lack of opportunity, lack of options otherwise.</p>
<p>So I forced myself through the Academy,</p>
<p>barely graduated with a 2.4 GPA.</p>
<p>And then went on the Air Force taught me how to fly.</p>
<p>And then the Air Force taught me about nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>And I ended up as a nuclear missile commander in Montana.</p>
<p>And I chose to leave the Air Force</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t like shaving my face.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t like having short hair.</p>
<p>And I most definitely didn&rsquo;t like shining my shoes.</p>
<p>And I did not wanna be one of the people</p>
<p>in charge of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>So when I found myself as a person</p>
<p>in charge of 200 nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>I knew that I was going down the wrong road.</p>
<p>I have questions about this.</p>
<p>And more importantly, I have questions about your hair.</p>
<p>So you had short hair at the time?</p>
<p>I had, yeah, you have to.</p>
<p>Military regulations, you can&rsquo;t have hair</p>
<p>longer than one inch.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And this, the beautiful hair you have now,</p>
<p>that came to be in the CIA or after?</p>
<p>This, so I discovered I had messy hair in CIA</p>
<p>because I used to go muge, we called it muge.</p>
<p>I used to go Mujahideen style,</p>
<p>big burly beard and crazy wacky hair.</p>
<p>Because an ambiguously brown guy with a big beard</p>
<p>and long hair can go anywhere in the world</p>
<p>without anyone even noticing him.</p>
<p>They either think that he&rsquo;s a janitor</p>
<p>or they think that he&rsquo;s like some forgotten part of history</p>
<p>but nobody ever thinks that that guy is a spy.</p>
<p>So it was the perfect, for me,</p>
<p>it was one of my favorite disguises.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s known as a level two disguise.</p>
<p>One of my favorite disguises to Don</p>
<p>was just dilapidated brown guy.</p>
<p>Can you actually, we&rsquo;ll just take a million tangents.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a level two disguise?</p>
<p>What are the different levels of disguise?</p>
<p>What are the disguises?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s three levels of disguise by and large.</p>
<p>Level one is what we also know,</p>
<p>what we also call light disguise.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s essentially, you put on sunglasses</p>
<p>and a ball cap and that&rsquo;s a disguise.</p>
<p>You look different than you normally look.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just different enough</p>
<p>that someone who&rsquo;s never seen you before,</p>
<p>someone who literally has to see you</p>
<p>just from a picture on the internet,</p>
<p>they may not recognize you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why you see celebrities walk around</p>
<p>with ball caps and oversized jackets and baseball hats</p>
<p>because they just need to not look</p>
<p>like they look in the tabloid</p>
<p>or not look like they look in TV.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s level one.</p>
<p>Let me jump from level one to level three.</p>
<p>Level three is all of your prosthetics,</p>
<p>all the stuff you see in Mission Impossible,</p>
<p>your fake ears, your fake faces, your fat suits,</p>
<p>your stilts inside your feet, all that&rsquo;s level three.</p>
<p>Whenever they make any kind of prosthetic disguise,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a level three disguise</p>
<p>because prosthetics are very damning</p>
<p>if you are caught with a prosthetic.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re caught wearing a sudden,</p>
<p>wearing a baseball hat and sunglasses,</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s gonna say you&rsquo;re a spy.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re caught with a custom made nose prosthetic</p>
<p>that changes the way your face looks</p>
<p>or when someone pops out a fake jaw</p>
<p>and they see that your top teeth don&rsquo;t look like they did</p>
<p>in this prosthetic, then all of a sudden</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got some very difficult questions to ask</p>
<p>or to answer.</p>
<p>So level three is extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>Level one is not dangerous.</p>
<p>Level two is longterm disguise.</p>
<p>Level two is all the things that you can do</p>
<p>to permanently change the way you look</p>
<p>for a long period of time</p>
<p>so that whether you&rsquo;re aggressed in the street</p>
<p>or whether someone breaks into your hotel room or whatever,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>So maybe that&rsquo;s, maybe you get a tattoo.</p>
<p>Maybe you cut your hair short.</p>
<p>Maybe you grow your hair long.</p>
<p>Maybe you go bald.</p>
<p>Maybe you start wearing glasses.</p>
<p>Well, glasses are technically a prosthetic,</p>
<p>but you can, if you have teeth pulled,</p>
<p>if you gain 20 pounds, really gain 20 pounds</p>
<p>or lose 15 pounds, whatever you might do,</p>
<p>all of that&rsquo;s considered level two.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s designed for a longterm mission</p>
<p>so that people believe you are who you say you are</p>
<p>in that disguise.</p>
<p>A lot of that is physical characteristics.</p>
<p>What about what actors do,</p>
<p>which is the&hellip;</p>
<p>Method acting.</p>
<p>Yeah, the method acting,</p>
<p>sort of developing a backstory in your own mind,</p>
<p>and then you start pretending</p>
<p>that you host a podcast and teach at a university</p>
<p>and then do research and so on</p>
<p>just so that people can believe</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not actually an agent.</p>
<p>Is that part of the disguise levels or no?</p>
<p>So yes, disguise has to do with physical character traits.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what a disguise is.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re talking about is known as a cover legend.</p>
<p>When you go undercover,</p>
<p>what you claim to be, who you claim to be,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called your legend, your cover legend.</p>
<p>Every disguise would theoretically have</p>
<p>its own cover legend.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s just to describe</p>
<p>why you&rsquo;re wearing what you&rsquo;re wearing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all a cover.</p>
<p>So the method acting,</p>
<p>this is a fantastic point</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t get to make very often,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m glad you asked.</p>
<p>The difference between CIA officers in the field</p>
<p>and method actors</p>
<p>is that method actors try to become the character.</p>
<p>They try to shed all vestiges of who they really are</p>
<p>and become the character,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s part of what makes them so amazing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also part of what makes them mentally unstable</p>
<p>over long periods of time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of what feeds their depression,</p>
<p>their anxiety, their personal issues,</p>
<p>because they lose sight of who they really are.</p>
<p>Field officers don&rsquo;t get that luxury.</p>
<p>We have to always, always remember</p>
<p>we are a covert CIA intelligence officer</p>
<p>collecting secrets in the field.</p>
<p>We have to remember that.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re taught a very specific skill</p>
<p>to compartmentalize our true self separately,</p>
<p>but make that true self the true identity.</p>
<p>So then we can still live and act</p>
<p>and effectively carry out our cover legend</p>
<p>without ever losing sight,</p>
<p>without ever losing that compass true north</p>
<p>of who we actually are.</p>
<p>And then we can compartmentalize</p>
<p>and secure all the information that we need,</p>
<p>retain it, remember it,</p>
<p>but then return to our true self</p>
<p>when we get back to a position of safety.</p>
<p>Is it possible to do that?</p>
<p>So I just have kind of anecdotal evidence for myself.</p>
<p>I really try to be the exact same person in all conditions,</p>
<p>which makes it very easy.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re not lying,</p>
<p>it makes it very easy to, first of all, to exist,</p>
<p>but also to communicate a kind of authenticity</p>
<p>and a genuineness, which I think is really important.</p>
<p>Like trust and integrity around trust</p>
<p>is extremely important to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the thing that opens doors</p>
<p>and maintains relationships.</p>
<p>And I tend to think, like when I was in Ukraine,</p>
<p>so many doors just opened to the very high security areas</p>
<p>and everywhere else too.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve just interacted with some incredible people</p>
<p>without any kind of concerns.</p>
<p>You know, who is this guy?</p>
<p>Is he gonna spread it?</p>
<p>You know, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And I tend to believe that you&rsquo;re able</p>
<p>to communicate a trustworthiness somehow</p>
<p>if you just are who you are.</p>
<p>And I think, I suppose method actors</p>
<p>are trying to achieve that by becoming something</p>
<p>and they can, I just feel like there is very subtle cues</p>
<p>that are extremely difficult to fake.</p>
<p>Like you really have to become that person, be that person.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying as a CIA agent,</p>
<p>you have to remember that you are there</p>
<p>to collect information.</p>
<p>Do you think that gives you away?</p>
<p>So one of the flaws in your argument</p>
<p>is that you keep referring to how you feel.</p>
<p>I feel this, I feel that, I feel like this,</p>
<p>I feel like that.</p>
<p>That feeling is a predictable character trait</p>
<p>of all human beings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pink matter, we call it pink matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cognitive trait.</p>
<p>You are not alone in trusting your feelings.</p>
<p>All people trust their feelings.</p>
<p>But because what CIA teaches us</p>
<p>is how to systematically create artificial relationships</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re the one in control of the source</p>
<p>that is giving us intelligence.</p>
<p>And the core element to being able to control</p>
<p>a relationship is understanding</p>
<p>the pink matter truth of feelings.</p>
<p>What all people feel becomes their point of view</p>
<p>on what reality is.</p>
<p>So when you understand and you learn how to manipulate</p>
<p>what people feel, then you can essentially direct them</p>
<p>to feel any way you want them to feel.</p>
<p>So if you want them to feel like they can trust you,</p>
<p>you can make them feel that way.</p>
<p>If you want them to feel like you&rsquo;re a good guy</p>
<p>or a bad guy, if you want them to feel like</p>
<p>they should give you secrets even though their government</p>
<p>tells them not to, you can do that.</p>
<p>There are men who make women feel like they love them</p>
<p>and just so that the woman will sleep with them.</p>
<p>There are women who make men feel like they love them</p>
<p>just so the men will give them their money.</p>
<p>Manipulation is a core behavioral trait</p>
<p>of all the human species because we all understand</p>
<p>to some level how powerful feelings are,</p>
<p>but feelings are not the same thing</p>
<p>as logical, rational thought.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re two different sides of the brain.</p>
<p>What CIA teaches us how to do is systematically tap into</p>
<p>the right side, emotional side of the brain</p>
<p>so that we can quickly get past all of the stuff</p>
<p>you were just saying, all of the,</p>
<p>well, don&rsquo;t you have to be convincing</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t you have to really know your story</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t you have to be able to defend it?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you have to have authenticity</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t you have to have genuine feelings?</p>
<p>Yes, all of those things are true</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re having a genuine relationship,</p>
<p>but in an artificial relationship,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s ways to bypass all of that</p>
<p>and get right to the heart of making someone</p>
<p>feel comfortable and safe.</p>
<p>I guess the question I&rsquo;m asking</p>
<p>and the thing I was implying is that creating</p>
<p>an artificial relationship is an extremely difficult skill</p>
<p>to accomplish the level, like how good I am at being me</p>
<p>and creating a feeling in another person that I create.</p>
<p>For you to do that artificially,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gotta be, you gotta be,</p>
<p>my sense is you gotta be really damn good at that kind of thing.</p>
<p>I would venture to say, I mean,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to measure how difficult the thing is,</p>
<p>but especially when you&rsquo;re communicating with people</p>
<p>whose job depends on forming trusting relationships,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna smell bullshit.</p>
<p>And to get past that bullshit detector is tough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tough skill.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So I would say that.</p>
<p>Or maybe I&rsquo;m wrong actually on that.</p>
<p>I would say that once you understand the system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that hard.</p>
<p>It makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>But I would also say that to your exact point,</p>
<p>you are right that people smell bullshit.</p>
<p>People smell bullshit.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>If you come in smelling like goat shit,</p>
<p>you still smell like shit, but you don&rsquo;t smell like bullshit.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t count you out right away.</p>
<p>And if you come in smelling like rotten tomatoes</p>
<p>or if you come in smelling like lavender</p>
<p>or if you come in smelling like vanilla</p>
<p>or if you come in without any smell at all,</p>
<p>all that matters is that you don&rsquo;t smell like bullshit.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing that&rsquo;s one of the secret sauces of CIA.</p>
<p>When you look and act like a spy, people think you&rsquo;re a spy.</p>
<p>If you look and act in any other way,</p>
<p>you know what they never ever think you are?</p>
<p>A spy.</p>
<p>They might think you&rsquo;re an idiot.</p>
<p>They might think you&rsquo;re trailer trash.</p>
<p>They might think that you&rsquo;re a migrant worker,</p>
<p>but they never think you&rsquo;re a spy.</p>
<p>And that lesson in everyday life is immensely powerful.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to take your boss&rsquo;s job,</p>
<p>as long as you don&rsquo;t ever look like the employee</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s trying to take the boss&rsquo;s job,</p>
<p>the boss is focused on all the employees</p>
<p>who are trying to take his job.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s prioritizing whether they know it or not.</p>
<p>The goal is to just not be the one that they&rsquo;re targeting.</p>
<p>Target them without them knowing you&rsquo;re targeting them.</p>
<p>So people just, when they meet you, they put you in a bin.</p>
<p>And if you want to avoid being put in a particular bin,</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t act like the person that would be,</p>
<p>just show some kind of characteristics</p>
<p>that bin you in some other way.</p>
<p>Exactly right.</p>
<p>You have to be in a bin.</p>
<p>Just choose the bin.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So you, knowing these methods,</p>
<p>when you talk to people, especially in civilian life,</p>
<p>how do you know who&rsquo;s lying to you and not?</p>
<p>That gets to be more into the trained skill side of things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s body cues, there&rsquo;s micro expressions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that micro expressions alone do anything.</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t believe that micro expressions</p>
<p>without an effective baseline do anything.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t for a second think that I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>all the people out there pitching</p>
<p>that you can tell if someone&rsquo;s lying to you</p>
<p>just by looking at their face, it&rsquo;s all baloney.</p>
<p>In my world, that&rsquo;s baloney.</p>
<p>Like the way you move your eyes or something like that.</p>
<p>Without knowing a baseline, without knowing.</p>
<p>For that individual. For that individual.</p>
<p>Then you actually don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And an individual&rsquo;s baseline is based on education,</p>
<p>culture, life experience, you name it, right?</p>
<p>So this is huge.</p>
<p>But when you combine facial expressions</p>
<p>with body movements, body language, nonverbal cues,</p>
<p>and you add on top of that effective elicitation techniques</p>
<p>that you are in control of,</p>
<p>now you have a more robust platform</p>
<p>to tell if someone&rsquo;s lying to you.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like a set of like interrogation trajectories</p>
<p>you can go down that can help you figure out a person.</p>
<p>Technically they&rsquo;re interview, interview concepts.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Because an interrogation,</p>
<p>an interrogation is something very different</p>
<p>than an interview.</p>
<p>And in the world of professionals,</p>
<p>an interrogation is very different.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
<p>The nature of how relaxed the thing is or what?</p>
<p>So in an interrogation, there&rsquo;s a clear pattern of dominance.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no equality.</p>
<p>Also, there&rsquo;s no escape.</p>
<p>You are there until the interrogator is done with you.</p>
<p>Anybody who&rsquo;s ever been reprimanded by mom and dad</p>
<p>knows what an interrogation feels like.</p>
<p>Anybody who&rsquo;s ever been called into the principal&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>or the boss&rsquo;s office,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what interrogation feels like.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t leave until the boss says you can leave.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re there to say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s to answer questions the boss asks questions.</p>
<p>An interview is an equal exchange of ideas.</p>
<p>You are in control of this interview, for sure.</p>
<p>But if we were having coffee,</p>
<p>I could take control if I wanted to take control.</p>
<p>If I wanted to ask you personal questions, I would.</p>
<p>If I wanted to talk to you about your background, I could.</p>
<p>Why am I in control of this interview exactly?</p>
<p>Because the person in control</p>
<p>is the person asking questions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting here, as you&rsquo;ve spoken about,</p>
<p>my power here is I&rsquo;m the quiet one listening.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re exactly right.</p>
<p>Guess where this conversation goes?</p>
<p>Anywhere you choose to take it,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re the one asking questions.</p>
<p>Every time I answer a question,</p>
<p>I am creating a pattern of obedience to you,</p>
<p>which subliminally, subconsciously,</p>
<p>makes me that much more apt to answer your questions.</p>
<p>Of course, you can always turn and start asking me questions.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying that through conversation,</p>
<p>you can call it interviewing,</p>
<p>you can start to see cracks</p>
<p>in the story of the person</p>
<p>and the degree to which they exaggerate or lie</p>
<p>or to see how much they can be trusted, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is that through a conversation,</p>
<p>you develop a baseline.</p>
<p>Even just in the first part of our conversation,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been able to create some baseline elements about you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been able to create baseline elements about me.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re just not a friend of mine.</p>
<p>From those baselines,</p>
<p>now we can push through more intentional questions</p>
<p>to test whether or not the person is being truthful</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re operating within their baseline,</p>
<p>or if you are triggering sensitivities</p>
<p>outside of their baseline,</p>
<p>and then you can start to see their tells.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah, baseline, even the tells, right?</p>
<p>The eye contact.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably already formed a baseline</p>
<p>that I have trouble making eye contact.</p>
<p>And so if you ask me difficult questions</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not making eye contact,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s not a good signal of me lying or whatever.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Because I always have trouble making eye contact,</p>
<p>stuff like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really fascinating.</p>
<p>The majority of your eye movement is to the right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Your right, my left, right?</p>
<p>Which is usually someone who&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>if you ask micro expressionists,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s someone who&rsquo;s referencing fact.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not necessarily what&rsquo;s happening for you</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re pulling concepts out of the air.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s also a place</p>
<p>where you reference something other than fact.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a place for you to find creativity.</p>
<p>So if I just thought that you were lying</p>
<p>because you look up and to the right, I would be wrong.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so fascinating.</p>
<p>And a lot of that has to do with like habits</p>
<p>that are formed and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>or maybe some right hand, left hand type of situation.</p>
<p>Right eye dominance.</p>
<p>Yeah, right eye dominance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna make you look to the right.</p>
<p>Is this a science or an art?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of both.</p>
<p>I would say that like all good art,</p>
<p>art is taught from a foundation of skills.</p>
<p>And those skills are played,</p>
<p>are taught in a very structured manner.</p>
<p>And then the way that you use the skills after that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more of the artistic grace.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve always called espionage an art.</p>
<p>Spying is an art.</p>
<p>Being able to hack human beings is an art,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all based in a foundation of science.</p>
<p>You still have to learn how to mix the color palette</p>
<p>and use certain brushes.</p>
<p>Do you think of that as a kind of the study</p>
<p>of human psychology?</p>
<p>Is that what a psychologist does or a psychiatrist?</p>
<p>What from this process have you learned about human nature?</p>
<p>Human nature.</p>
<p>I mean, I suppose the answer to that could be a book,</p>
<p>but it probably will be a book.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll save you that, yeah.</p>
<p>But is there things that are surprising about human nature,</p>
<p>surprising to us civilians that you could speak to?</p>
<p>Yes, one thing is extremely surprising about human nature,</p>
<p>which is funny, because that&rsquo;s not the answer</p>
<p>I would have said.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m glad that you clarified this specific question.</p>
<p>The thing that&rsquo;s surprising about human nature</p>
<p>is that human beings long, like in their soul,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a painful longing to be with other people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really surprising,</p>
<p>because we all wanna pretend like we&rsquo;re strong.</p>
<p>We all wanna pretend like we&rsquo;re independent.</p>
<p>We all wanna pretend like we are the masters of our destiny.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s truly consistent in all people</p>
<p>is this longing to commune with others like us.</p>
<p>My more practical answer about what I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>to be the truth is that human nature is predictable.</p>
<p>And that predictability is what gives people</p>
<p>an incredible advantage over other people.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the surprising piece.</p>
<p>I mean, even when CIA taught me</p>
<p>that human nature is predictable, it just made sense.</p>
<p>I was like, oh yeah, that makes sense.</p>
<p>But what I never ever anticipated was</p>
<p>no matter where I&rsquo;ve been in the world,</p>
<p>no matter who I&rsquo;ve talked to,</p>
<p>no matter what socioeconomic bracket is that longing,</p>
<p>man, it hurts.</p>
<p>Loneliness sucks, and togetherness feels good,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re together with someone</p>
<p>you know isn&rsquo;t the right person.</p>
<p>It still feels better than being alone.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s such a deep truth you speak to,</p>
<p>and I could talk about that for a long time.</p>
<p>There is, I mean, through these conversations in general,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s being recorded or not,</p>
<p>I hunger to discover in the other person that longing.</p>
<p>You strip away the other things,</p>
<p>and then you share in the longing for that connection.</p>
<p>And I particularly also have detected that in people</p>
<p>from all walks of life, including people</p>
<p>that others might identify as evil or hard,</p>
<p>as completely cold, it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve hardened themselves in their search,</p>
<p>and who knows what dark place their brain is in,</p>
<p>their heart is in, but that longing is still there.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s an ember, it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the reason why in World War I and World War II,</p>
<p>you know, enemy combatants still shared cigarettes</p>
<p>on the front lines during periods of holidays</p>
<p>or bad weather or whatever else,</p>
<p>because that human connection, man, it triumphs over all.</p>
<p>See, that&rsquo;s in part of what I refer to when I say love,</p>
<p>because I feel like if political leaders</p>
<p>and people in conflict at the small scale</p>
<p>and the large scale were able to tune into that longing,</p>
<p>to seek in each other that basic longing</p>
<p>for human connection, a lot of problems could be solved.</p>
<p>But of course, it&rsquo;s difficult,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a game of chicken.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s if you open yourself up to reveal</p>
<p>that longing for connection with others,</p>
<p>people can hurt you.</p>
<p>Well, I would go a step farther,</p>
<p>and I would say that taking the connection away,</p>
<p>punishing, penalizing people by removing the connection</p>
<p>is a powerful tool, and that&rsquo;s what we see.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we send people to jail.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we put economic sanctions on countries.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we ground our children</p>
<p>and send them to their rooms.</p>
<p>We are penalizing them.</p>
<p>Whether we know it or not, we&rsquo;re using punitive damage</p>
<p>by taking away that basic human connection,</p>
<p>that longing for community.</p>
<p>What was your recruitment process and training process</p>
<p>and things you could speak to in the CIA?</p>
<p>As I was leaving the Air Force, all that was on my mind,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you were like at 27,</p>
<p>but I was a total tip shit at 27.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not much better now at 42, but.</p>
<p>You and me, Bill.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I was like, I just wanted to be anything</p>
<p>other than a military officer,</p>
<p>so I was actually in the process of applying</p>
<p>to the Peace Corps through this thing called the internet,</p>
<p>which was still fairly rudimentary in 2007.</p>
<p>I had a computer lab that we went to,</p>
<p>and it had 10 computers in it,</p>
<p>and you had to log in and log out,</p>
<p>and slow internet and everything else,</p>
<p>but anyways, I was filling out an online application</p>
<p>to go work in the US Peace Corps.</p>
<p>I wanted to grow my hair out.</p>
<p>I wanted to stop wearing shoes that were shiny.</p>
<p>I wanted to meet a hippie chick</p>
<p>and have hippie babies in the wild</p>
<p>teaching Nigerian children how to read,</p>
<p>so that was the path I was going down,</p>
<p>and as I filled in all of my details,</p>
<p>there came this page that popped up,</p>
<p>and it was this blinking red page,</p>
<p>and it said, stop here.</p>
<p>You may qualify for other government positions.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re willing to put your application</p>
<p>on hold for 72 hours,</p>
<p>that gives us a chance to reach out to you,</p>
<p>so again, 27 year old dipshit.</p>
<p>I was like, sure, I&rsquo;ll put myself on hold</p>
<p>if I might qualify for other government opportunities,</p>
<p>and then about a day later, I got a phone call</p>
<p>from an almost unlisted number.</p>
<p>It just said 703, which was very strange to see</p>
<p>on my flip phone at the time, just one 703 area code,</p>
<p>and I picked it up, and it was a person</p>
<p>from Northern Virginia asking me</p>
<p>if I would be telling me that I was qualified</p>
<p>for a position in national security,</p>
<p>and if I would be interested, they&rsquo;ll pay for my ticket</p>
<p>and fly me up to Langley, Virginia.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t say CIA.</p>
<p>They said Langley.</p>
<p>I put one on one together, and I was like,</p>
<p>maybe this is CIA, like, how cool is this?</p>
<p>Or maybe this is all make believe,</p>
<p>and this is totally fake, so either way,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t hurt me at all to say yes.</p>
<p>They already have my phone number, so yes, yes, yes,</p>
<p>and then I remember thinking,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way that happened, and this isn&rsquo;t real,</p>
<p>and then a day later, I got FedEx</p>
<p>or an overnight delivery of an airplane ticket</p>
<p>and a hotel reservation and a rental car reservation,</p>
<p>and then I just kept doing the next thing,</p>
<p>which I found out later on is a form of control.</p>
<p>You just do the next thing that they tell you to do,</p>
<p>and then before I knew it, I was interviewing</p>
<p>in a nondescript building with a person</p>
<p>who only told me their first name for a position</p>
<p>with the National Clandestine Service.</p>
<p>So you never really got a chance to think about it</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s small steps along the way,</p>
<p>and it kind of just leads you,</p>
<p>and maybe your personality is such that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an adventure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an adventure, and because it&rsquo;s one step at a time,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t necessarily see the negative consequences</p>
<p>of the adventure.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think about any of that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just stepping into the adventure.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no work involved.</p>
<p>Somebody else is doing all the work,</p>
<p>telling me where to be and when.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot like basic training in the military.</p>
<p>Anybody who&rsquo;s ever been through basic training</p>
<p>will tell you they hated the first few days,</p>
<p>and then by the end, it was really comforting</p>
<p>because you just did what you were told.</p>
<p>They told you when to eat.</p>
<p>They made the decision of what to eat,</p>
<p>and then you just, you marched when they told you to march,</p>
<p>shined your shoes when they told you to shine your shoes.</p>
<p>Human beings love being told what to do.</p>
<p>What about the training process</p>
<p>for becoming a covert CIA agent?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the interview process is.</p>
<p>Yeah, the interview process, too.</p>
<p>How rigorous was that?</p>
<p>It was very rigorous.</p>
<p>That was where it became difficult.</p>
<p>Everything up to the first interview was easy,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s three interviews,</p>
<p>and some people are lucky enough</p>
<p>to have four or five interviews if something goes wrong</p>
<p>or something goes awry with the first few interviews.</p>
<p>And again, this might be dated from what I went through,</p>
<p>but during the interview process is when they start,</p>
<p>they do your psychological evaluations.</p>
<p>They do your, they do personality assessments.</p>
<p>They do skills assessments.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll start sending you back to wherever you&rsquo;re living</p>
<p>with assignments, not intel assignments,</p>
<p>but actual homework assignments.</p>
<p>Write an essay about three parts of the world</p>
<p>that you think will be most impacted</p>
<p>in the next three to five years,</p>
<p>or prioritize the top three strategic priorities</p>
<p>for the United States and put it into 250 words</p>
<p>or 2,500 words and whatever else,</p>
<p>double spaced in this font, yada, yada, yada,</p>
<p>like super specific stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of stressful,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just like going back to college again.</p>
<p>So you go through all of those acts,</p>
<p>and then you submit this stuff to some PO box</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t have anybody that&rsquo;s ever gonna respond to you,</p>
<p>and then you hope.</p>
<p>You just send it into the ether,</p>
<p>and you hope that you sent it right.</p>
<p>You hope that you wrote well enough.</p>
<p>You hope that your assessment was right,</p>
<p>whatever else it might be,</p>
<p>and then eventually get another phone call that says,</p>
<p>hey, we received your package.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been moved to the next level of interview,</p>
<p>and now we need you to go to this other nondescript building</p>
<p>in this other nondescript city,</p>
<p>and then you start meeting.</p>
<p>You start sitting in waiting rooms</p>
<p>with other groups of people</p>
<p>who are at the same phase of interview with you,</p>
<p>which were some of the coolest experiences</p>
<p>that I remember still.</p>
<p>One of my best friends to this day,</p>
<p>who I don&rsquo;t get to talk to because he&rsquo;s still undercover,</p>
<p>is a guy I met during those interview processes,</p>
<p>and I was like, oh, we met.</p>
<p>I saw what he was wearing.</p>
<p>He saw what I was wearing.</p>
<p>I was brown.</p>
<p>So you immediately connected,</p>
<p>and you liked the people there.</p>
<p>Close.</p>
<p>More like we immediately judge each other,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re all untrained.</p>
<p>So he looked at me, and he was like,</p>
<p>brown dude with crazy hair, and I was wearing,</p>
<p>dude, I was dressed like a total ass.</p>
<p>I was dressed in a clubbing shirt.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I thought it would be a good idea</p>
<p>to go to a CIA interview in a clubbing shirt</p>
<p>with my buttons unbuttoned down to here.</p>
<p>And he was like, yeah, you were really,</p>
<p>after we got in, he was like,</p>
<p>yeah, dude, you were always really cool to talk to,</p>
<p>but I was like, there&rsquo;s no way that idiot&rsquo;s getting in.</p>
<p>And I remember looking at him and being like,</p>
<p>dude, you were just another white guy in a black suit.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not looking for you, but here you are.</p>
<p>So it was just, those kinds of things were so interesting,</p>
<p>because we were totally wrong</p>
<p>about what CIA was looking for.</p>
<p>Until you&rsquo;re in, you have no idea what they&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re just shooting in the dark.</p>
<p>Did they have you do like a lie detector test?</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s called a polygraph.</p>
<p>Polygraph.</p>
<p>How effective, just interesting,</p>
<p>or our previous discussion, how effective are those?</p>
<p>Polygraphs are really interesting.</p>
<p>So one of the things that people don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>about polygraphs is that polygraphs</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t meant to detect a lie.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re called a lie detector,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not actually meant to detect a lie.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re built to detect variants</p>
<p>from your physiological baseline.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re essentially meant to identify sensitivities</p>
<p>to certain types of questions.</p>
<p>And then as they identify a sensitivity to a question,</p>
<p>it gives the interviewer an additional piece of information</p>
<p>to direct the next round of questions.</p>
<p>So then from there, they can kind of see</p>
<p>how sensitive you are to a certain level of questions.</p>
<p>And your sensitivity could be a sign of dishonesty,</p>
<p>but it could also be a sign of vulnerability.</p>
<p>So the interrogator themselves, the interviewer themselves,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the one that have to make the judgment call</p>
<p>as to which one it is,</p>
<p>which is why you might see multiple interviewers</p>
<p>over the course of multiple polygraphs.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s really what they&rsquo;re all about.</p>
<p>So, I mean, outside of, they&rsquo;re extremely uncomfortable,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re mentally uncomfortable,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s also, you sit on a pad</p>
<p>because the pad is supposed to be able to tell</p>
<p>like your body movements, but also like your sphincter</p>
<p>contractions or whatever.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re sitting on this pad, you&rsquo;re plugged in,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re strapped in, you&rsquo;re tied up,</p>
<p>and it takes so much time to get in there.</p>
<p>And then they start asking you questions,</p>
<p>baseline questions at first,</p>
<p>and then other questions from there.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re just answering the best you can.</p>
<p>And you never know what they&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really hard not to get anxious of that anyways.</p>
<p>And then&hellip;</p>
<p>Are they the whole time monitoring the readings?</p>
<p>Yeah, from like a big, they&rsquo;ve got multiple screens</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve got just, it&rsquo;s all information superiority.</p>
<p>They have information superiority.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the idiot looking away from them</p>
<p>or looking sideways of them and trying not to move</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re afraid that if you like have gas</p>
<p>or if you move a little bit,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna bury you from your baseline.</p>
<p>And the whole time you&rsquo;re worried, your heart&rsquo;s racing</p>
<p>and your blood pressure&rsquo;s increasing,</p>
<p>which is a variance from baseline.</p>
<p>So yeah, that means it&rsquo;s an interesting art.</p>
<p>Or your baseline.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s some people that are just chilling</p>
<p>the whole time and that&rsquo;s their baseline.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re establishing a baseline.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess that means the polygraph</p>
<p>is a skill that you develop to do it well.</p>
<p>So when people talk about beating a lie detector,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re telling an effective lie.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to tell a lie to an interviewer.</p>
<p>And the interviewer doesn&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re being honest or not honest about a topic.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re looking for is sensitivity.</p>
<p>If they see no sensitivity, that&rsquo;s a big sign for them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big sign that you&rsquo;re probably a pathological liar.</p>
<p>If you show sensitivity to many things,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s a sign that you&rsquo;re probably an anxious person</p>
<p>and they can still reset their baseline</p>
<p>because they can tell how your anxiety</p>
<p>is increasing in 15 minute increments.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a unique skill.</p>
<p>I mean, a really good polygrapher is immensely valuable.</p>
<p>But yeah, it&rsquo;s the misnomers,</p>
<p>the misconceptions about polygraphs are vast.</p>
<p>You also mentioned personality tests.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>So how effective are personality tests?</p>
<p>One for the hiring process,</p>
<p>but also for understanding a human being.</p>
<p>So personality is extremely important</p>
<p>for understanding human being.</p>
<p>And I would say that there&rsquo;s a thousand different ways</p>
<p>of looking at personality.</p>
<p>The only one that I count with any significance is the MBTI.</p>
<p>And the MBTI is what all the leading spy agencies</p>
<p>around the world use as well.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s kind of interesting to hear.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s been criticisms of that kind of test.</p>
<p>There have been criticisms for a long time.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you think there&rsquo;s value.</p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a few reasons why, right?</p>
<p>So first, MBTI makes the claim</p>
<p>that your core personality doesn&rsquo;t change over time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s calibrated.</p>
<p>And one of the big arguments is that people say</p>
<p>that your personality can change over time.</p>
<p>Now, in my experience, the MBTI is exactly correct.</p>
<p>Your core personality does not change</p>
<p>because your core personality is defined</p>
<p>as your personality when all resources are removed.</p>
<p>So essentially, your emergency mode, your dire conditions,</p>
<p>that is your core personality.</p>
<p>We can all act a little more extroverted.</p>
<p>We can all be a little more empathetic</p>
<p>when we have tons of time and money and patience.</p>
<p>When you strip away all that time, money, and patience,</p>
<p>how empathetic are you?</p>
<p>How much do you like being around other people?</p>
<p>How much do you like being alone?</p>
<p>Do you make judgments or do you analyze information?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so powerful about MBTI</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s talking about what people are like</p>
<p>when you strip away resources.</p>
<p>And then because it&rsquo;s so consistent,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also only four codes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super easy to be able to assess a human being</p>
<p>through a dialogue, through a series of conversations,</p>
<p>to be able to hone in with high accuracy</p>
<p>what is there for letter code.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only 16 options and it becomes extremely valuable.</p>
<p>Is it perfectly precise and does everybody do it the same?</p>
<p>I mean, those things are, the answers to those are no,</p>
<p>but is it operationally useful in a short period of time?</p>
<p>That is a resoundingly powerful yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just, I only know, I think the first letter,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s introverted and extroverted, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken the test before,</p>
<p>just like a crude version of the test</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the same problem you have with IQ tests.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the right thorough way of doing it</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s like fun internet way.</p>
<p>And do you mind sharing what your personality?</p>
<p>My type index?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an ENTP, that&rsquo;s an extrovert,</p>
<p>intuitive, perceiver, thinker, ENT, thinker, P, perceiver.</p>
<p>My wife is an ISFJ, which is the polar opposite of me.</p>
<p>E, I&rsquo;m extroverted, she&rsquo;s introverted,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an intuitor, she&rsquo;s a sensor, I&rsquo;m a thinker,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a feeler, I&rsquo;m a perceiver, she&rsquo;s a judger.</p>
<p>Is there good science on like longterm</p>
<p>successful relationships in terms of the dynamics of that,</p>
<p>the 16, I wonder if there&rsquo;s good data on this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a lot of good data</p>
<p>in personalities writ large because there&rsquo;s not a lot</p>
<p>of money to be made in personality testing,</p>
<p>but I would say that with experience,</p>
<p>with a good MBTI test, with a good paid test,</p>
<p>a 400, 500 question test,</p>
<p>once you understand your own code</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re taught how to assess the code of others,</p>
<p>with those two things kind of combined</p>
<p>because then you have experience and learning,</p>
<p>it becomes very useful and you can have high confidence</p>
<p>in the conclusions that you reach about</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s professions, about people&rsquo;s relationships</p>
<p>with family, about people&rsquo;s relationships professionally,</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s capabilities to deal with stress,</p>
<p>how people will perform when pushed outside</p>
<p>of their comfort zones, really, really powerful,</p>
<p>useful stuff in corporate world and in the espionage world.</p>
<p>So in terms of compressed representation</p>
<p>of another human being, you can&rsquo;t do much better</p>
<p>than those four letters.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe you can do much better.</p>
<p>In my experience, I have not seen anything better.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is kind of, it&rsquo;s difficult to realize</p>
<p>that there is a core personality</p>
<p>or to the degree that&rsquo;s true, it seems to be true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even more difficult to realize</p>
<p>that there is a stable, at least the science says so,</p>
<p>a stable, consistent intelligence, unfortunately,</p>
<p>you know, the G factor that they call,</p>
<p>that if you do a barrage of IQ tests,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to consistently represent that G factor.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re all born with that, we can&rsquo;t fix it.</p>
<p>And that defines so much of who we are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see it as sad, because it&rsquo;s, for me,</p>
<p>the faster you learn it, the faster you learn</p>
<p>what your own sort of natural strengths and weaknesses are,</p>
<p>the faster you get to stop wasting time</p>
<p>on things that you&rsquo;re never gonna be good at,</p>
<p>and you get to double down on the things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re already naturally skilled or interested in.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s always a silver lining to a cloud.</p>
<p>But I know now that I will never be a ballerina</p>
<p>or a ballerino, I know that I&rsquo;ll never be an artist,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never be a musician, I&rsquo;ll never be any of those things.</p>
<p>And when I was 18, that might&rsquo;ve made me sad,</p>
<p>but now at 42, I&rsquo;m like, well, shit, awesome.</p>
<p>I can go be something else good instead of always being bad.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna be a ballerina, ballerino.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m not graceful.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve learned this through years of experience.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s an MBTI equivalent</p>
<p>for grace of movement.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s called S sensor.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, because a sensor is someone who&rsquo;s able</p>
<p>to interact with the world around them</p>
<p>through their five senses very effectively.</p>
<p>Like if you talk to dancers, dancers can actually feel</p>
<p>the grace in all of their muscles.</p>
<p>They know what position their finger is in.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any idea.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what position my feet are in right now.</p>
<p>I had to look to make sure I actually feel the floor right.</p>
<p>Yeah, I definitely have.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s good to know.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not a dancer, but I do have that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a musician, man.</p>
<p>Well, the music, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true that there is that physical component,</p>
<p>but I think deeper,</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s a technical aspect to that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just like, it&rsquo;s less about feel,</p>
<p>but I do know jujitsu and grappling I&rsquo;ve done all my life.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, you know, there&rsquo;s some people who are clumsy</p>
<p>and they drop stuff all the time.</p>
<p>They run into stuff.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t, first of all, I don&rsquo;t know how that happens,</p>
<p>but to me, I just have an awareness of stuff.</p>
<p>Like if there&rsquo;s a little orientation.</p>
<p>Yeah, like, like I know that there&rsquo;s a small object</p>
<p>I have to step over and I have a good sense of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so, it&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re just like born with that or something.</p>
<p>My wife is brilliant and she still walks into doors.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, she&rsquo;ll walk in a doorway.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;ll bang her knee on the same wall that&rsquo;s been there</p>
<p>for the last 50 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for some reason, really hilarious.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good for me.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been asked, I think on Reddit,</p>
<p>are there big secrets that you know that could lend you</p>
<p>and our country in terrible trouble</p>
<p>if you came out to the public and you answered,</p>
<p>yes, I wish I could forget them.</p>
<p>So let me ask you just about secrecy in general.</p>
<p>Are these secrets or just other secrets,</p>
<p>ones that the public will never know</p>
<p>or will it come out in 10, 20, 50 years?</p>
<p>I guess the deeper question is,</p>
<p>what is the value of secrecy and transparency?</p>
<p>The standard classification</p>
<p>for all human intelligence operations</p>
<p>is something called two five X two, 25 by two.</p>
<p>So 50 years, 25 years times two years or times two rounds.</p>
<p>So in essence, anything that I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>has the first chance of becoming public domain,</p>
<p>declassified after 50 years,</p>
<p>unless there&rsquo;s some congressional requirement</p>
<p>for it to be reviewed and assessed earlier.</p>
<p>So by then, I&rsquo;ll be 80 something years old</p>
<p>or potentially dead, which is either way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when it can come out</p>
<p>according to its typical classification.</p>
<p>The value of secrets I have seen</p>
<p>is that secrets create space.</p>
<p>Secrets give opportunity for security.</p>
<p>They give opportunity for thinking.</p>
<p>They give space</p>
<p>and space is an incredibly advantageous thing to have.</p>
<p>If you know something somebody else doesn&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s just 15 or 20 minutes different,</p>
<p>you can direct, you can change the course of fate.</p>
<p>So I find secrets to be extremely valuable,</p>
<p>extremely useful.</p>
<p>Even at the place where secrets</p>
<p>are being kept from a large mass,</p>
<p>part of what all Americans need to understand</p>
<p>is that one of the trade offs</p>
<p>to building a system of government</p>
<p>that allows us to be first world and wealthy</p>
<p>and secure and successful,</p>
<p>one of the trade offs is that we have given up</p>
<p>a great deal of personal freedom.</p>
<p>And one of the personal freedoms that we give up</p>
<p>is the freedom of knowing what we wanna know.</p>
<p>You get to know what the government tells you,</p>
<p>you get to know what you need to know</p>
<p>or what you&rsquo;ve learned yourself,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t get to know secrets.</p>
<p>People who do get to know secrets know them for a reason.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called a need to know.</p>
<p>How difficult is it to maintain secrecy?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s surprisingly difficult as technology changes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also surprisingly difficult</p>
<p>as our culture becomes one where people want notoriety.</p>
<p>People wanna be the person who breaks the secret.</p>
<p>25 years ago, 40 years ago, that wasn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>There was a time in the United States</p>
<p>where if someone gave you a secret,</p>
<p>it was a point of personal honor not to share the secret.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re in a place where someone tells you a secret,</p>
<p>like that could turn into a Twitter post</p>
<p>that gets you a bunch of thumbs up</p>
<p>and a bunch of likes or whatever else.</p>
<p>An opportunity. Right.</p>
<p>So the value of secrets has changed.</p>
<p>And now there&rsquo;s almost a greater value on exposing secrets</p>
<p>than there is on keeping secrets.</p>
<p>That makes it difficult to keep secrets,</p>
<p>especially when technology is going in the same direction.</p>
<p>Yeah, where is the line?</p>
<p>And by the way, I&rsquo;m one of those old school people</p>
<p>with the secrets.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a karma thing.</p>
<p>Again, back to the trust.</p>
<p>I think in the short term you can benefit</p>
<p>by sharing a secret.</p>
<p>But in the long term, if people know they can trust you,</p>
<p>like the juicy of the secret, it&rsquo;s a test of sorts.</p>
<p>If they know you can keep that secret,</p>
<p>that means you&rsquo;re somebody that could be trusted.</p>
<p>And I believe that not just effectiveness in this life,</p>
<p>but happiness in this life is informing a circle</p>
<p>of people you can trust.</p>
<p>Right, we&rsquo;re taught that secrets and lies are similar</p>
<p>in that they have a limited shelf life.</p>
<p>If you treat them like food,</p>
<p>secrets and lies have a very limited shelf life.</p>
<p>So if you cash in on them while they&rsquo;re still fresh,</p>
<p>you beat them before they spoil.</p>
<p>You get to take advantage of them before they spoil.</p>
<p>However, trust has no limit to its shelf life.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like you&rsquo;re trading a short term victory</p>
<p>and losing a long term victory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always better to keep the secret.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always better to let the lie live</p>
<p>because it will eventually come to light</p>
<p>from somebody else, not from you,</p>
<p>because it already has a limited shelf life.</p>
<p>But what you win in exchange</p>
<p>for not being the one that cashed in on the secret</p>
<p>is immense trust.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about lying and trust and so on.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve been contacted by</p>
<p>or interacted with the CIA, the MI6, the FSB,</p>
<p>Mossad or any other intelligence agency.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of offended, but would I know if I was?</p>
<p>So from your perspective.</p>
<p>No, you would not know if you were.</p>
<p>For sure you&rsquo;ve been on their radar.</p>
<p>Absolutely, you&rsquo;ve got a file.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got a dossier somewhere.</p>
<p>Why would I be on their radar?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re a.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s interesting?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily that you are interesting</p>
<p>to someone as a foreign asset</p>
<p>or an intelligence collection source,</p>
<p>but your network is extremely interesting.</p>
<p>The networks are important too.</p>
<p>Correct, if someone had access to,</p>
<p>if someone was able to clone your phone,</p>
<p>every time you cross a border,</p>
<p>you go through some sort of security.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever been pulled into secondary</p>
<p>and separated from your bag,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s exactly when and how people clone computers.</p>
<p>They clone phones, they make whatever,</p>
<p>photocopies of your old school planner,</p>
<p>whatever it might be.</p>
<p>But for sure you are an intelligence target.</p>
<p>It just may be that you&rsquo;re not suitable</p>
<p>to be a person who reports foreign intelligence.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to understand that all people</p>
<p>are potential sources of valuable information</p>
<p>to the national security infrastructure</p>
<p>of our host country and any country that we visit.</p>
<p>Someone like you with your public footprint,</p>
<p>with your notoriety, with your educational background,</p>
<p>with your national identifications</p>
<p>becomes a viable and valuable target of information.</p>
<p>Yeah, so to speak to that,</p>
<p>I take security pretty seriously,</p>
<p>but not to the degree that it runs my life,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m very careful about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good, I&rsquo;m glad to hear that.</p>
<p>So the moment you start to think about germs, right?</p>
<p>Like you start to freak out</p>
<p>and you become sort of paralyzed by the stress of it.</p>
<p>So you have to balance those two things.</p>
<p>If you think about all the things</p>
<p>that could hurt you in this world</p>
<p>and all the risk you could take,</p>
<p>it can overwhelm your life.</p>
<p>That said, the cyber world is a weird world</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t have the same.</p>
<p>I know not to cross the street without looking each way</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a physical intuition about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure, I&rsquo;m a computer science guy,</p>
<p>so I have some intuition,</p>
<p>but the cyber world, it&rsquo;s really hard</p>
<p>to build up an intuition of what is safe and not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of people just logging out</p>
<p>of your devices all the time, like regularly.</p>
<p>Just like that physical access step</p>
<p>is a lot of people don&rsquo;t take.</p>
<p>I can just like walk in into the offices of a lot of CEOs</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like everything&rsquo;s wide open</p>
<p>for physical access of those systems,</p>
<p>which is kind of incredible for somebody,</p>
<p>that sounds really shady, but it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written key loggers,</p>
<p>like things that record everything you type</p>
<p>in the mouse you move.</p>
<p>And like I did that for, during my PhD,</p>
<p>I was recording everything you do on your device</p>
<p>and everything you do on your computer.</p>
<p>People sign up to the study, they willingly do this</p>
<p>to understand behavior.</p>
<p>I was trying to use machine learning</p>
<p>to identify who you are based on different biometric</p>
<p>and behavioral things, which allows me</p>
<p>to study human behavior and to see</p>
<p>which is uniquely identifiable.</p>
<p>And the goal there was to remove the need for a password.</p>
<p>But how easy it is to write a thing</p>
<p>that logs everything you type.</p>
<p>I was like, wait a minute, like I can probably get</p>
<p>a lot of people in the world to run this for me.</p>
<p>I can then get all of their passwords.</p>
<p>I mean, you could do so much,</p>
<p>like I can run the entirety of the CIA from just myself.</p>
<p>If I was, and I imagine there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of really good hackers like that out there,</p>
<p>much better than me.</p>
<p>So I tried to prevent myself from being</p>
<p>all the different low hanging fruit attack vectors</p>
<p>in my life.</p>
<p>I try to make it difficult to be that.</p>
<p>But then I&rsquo;m also aware that there&rsquo;s probably people</p>
<p>that are like five steps ahead.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing the right thing.</p>
<p>What I always advocate is the low hanging fruit</p>
<p>is what keeps you from being a target of opportunity.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re half assed hackers,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re lazy hackers, you&rsquo;re unskilled hackers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking for low hanging fruit.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking for the person who gets the Nigeria email</p>
<p>about how you could be getting $5 million</p>
<p>if you just give me your bank account.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>The thing that&rsquo;s scary is that if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>a target of opportunity,</p>
<p>if you become a intentional target,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s almost nothing you can do.</p>
<p>Because once you become an intentional target,</p>
<p>then your security apparatus,</p>
<p>they will create a dedicated customized way vector</p>
<p>of attacking your specific security apparatus.</p>
<p>And because security is always after, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always, there&rsquo;s the leading advantage</p>
<p>and the trailing advantage.</p>
<p>When it comes to attacks,</p>
<p>the leader always has the advantage</p>
<p>because they have to create the attack</p>
<p>before anybody else can create a way</p>
<p>to protect against the attack.</p>
<p>So the attack always comes first</p>
<p>and that means they always have the advantage.</p>
<p>You are always stuck just leaning on,</p>
<p>this is the best security that I know of.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there&rsquo;s always somebody who can create a way</p>
<p>of attacking the best security out there.</p>
<p>And once they win, they have a monopoly.</p>
<p>They have all that time until a new defensive countermeasure</p>
<p>is deployed.</p>
<p>Yeah, I tend to think exactly as you said,</p>
<p>that the long hanging fruit protects against like,</p>
<p>yeah, crimes of opportunity.</p>
<p>And then I assume that people can just hack in</p>
<p>if they really want.</p>
<p>Think about how much anxiety we would be able to solve</p>
<p>if everybody just accepted that.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s several things you do.</p>
<p>First of all, to be honest, it just makes me,</p>
<p>it keeps me honest.</p>
<p>Not to be a douchebag or like, not, yeah,</p>
<p>to assume everything could be public.</p>
<p>And so don&rsquo;t trade information that could hurt people</p>
<p>if it was made public.</p>
<p>So I try to do that.</p>
<p>And the thing I try to make sure is I,</p>
<p>like Home Alone style, try to.</p>
<p>Booby trap.</p>
<p>I really would like to know if I was hacked.</p>
<p>And so I try to assume that I will be hacked and detect it.</p>
<p>Have a tripwire or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, a tripwire through everything.</p>
<p>And not paranoid tripwise, just like open door.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s probably the future of life on this earth</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re going, like everybody of interest</p>
<p>is going to be hacked.</p>
<p>That hopefully inspires, now this is outside of company.</p>
<p>These are individuals.</p>
<p>I mean, there is, of course, if you&rsquo;re actually operating,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m just a, who am I?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a scientist person, podcasting person.</p>
<p>So if I was actually running a company</p>
<p>or was an integral part of some kind of military operation,</p>
<p>then you probably have to have an entire team that&rsquo;s now</p>
<p>doing that battle of trying to be ahead of the best hackers</p>
<p>in the world that are attacking.</p>
<p>But that requires a team that full time is their focus.</p>
<p>And then you still get in trouble.</p>
<p>Correct, yeah.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;ve seen as the norm, well, what I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>is the cutting edge standard for corporations</p>
<p>and the ultra wealthy and even intelligence organizations</p>
<p>is that we have tripwires.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better if you can&rsquo;t prevent from being hacked.</p>
<p>The next best thing is to know as soon as you get hacked</p>
<p>because then you can essentially terminate all the information.</p>
<p>If you know it fast enough, you can just</p>
<p>destroy the information.</p>
<p>This is what the ultra wealthy do.</p>
<p>They have multiple phones.</p>
<p>So as soon as one phone gets hacked, the tripwire goes off.</p>
<p>The operating system is totally deleted along</p>
<p>with all data on the phone.</p>
<p>And a second phone is turned on with a whole new separate set</p>
<p>of metadata.</p>
<p>And now for them, there&rsquo;s no break in service.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, oh, this phone went black.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a warning on it that says it was hacked.</p>
<p>So trash it because they don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>about the price of the phone.</p>
<p>Pick up the next phone, and we move on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best thing that you can do essentially outside</p>
<p>of trying to out hack the hackers.</p>
<p>And then even in your intelligence and military</p>
<p>worlds where cyber warfare is active,</p>
<p>the people who are aggressing are not</p>
<p>trying to create aggression that beats security.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to find aggressive techniques,</p>
<p>offensive techniques that have no security built around them</p>
<p>yet.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s too cost and time intensive</p>
<p>to protect against what you know is coming,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so much more efficient and cost effective</p>
<p>to go after new vectors.</p>
<p>So it just becomes like, it becomes almost a silly game</p>
<p>of your neighbor gets a guard dog.</p>
<p>So you get a bigger guard dog.</p>
<p>And then your neighbor gets a fence.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re just constantly outdoing each other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the security paradigm.</p>
<p>People just, they just one up each other</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s never worth it to just get to the same level.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re always trying to outdo each other.</p>
<p>Yeah, then maybe like banks have to fight that fight,</p>
<p>but not everybody can.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, no.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying I operated at the state of the art</p>
<p>with the trip wires.</p>
<p>This is good to know.</p>
<p>Absolutely, man.</p>
<p>And also just not using anybody else&rsquo;s services,</p>
<p>doing everything myself.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s harder to figure out what the heck</p>
<p>this person is doing.</p>
<p>Because if I&rsquo;m using somebody else&rsquo;s service,</p>
<p>like I did with QNAP,</p>
<p>I have a QNAP NAS I use for cold storage</p>
<p>of unimportant things, but a large videos.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if you know, but QNAP is a company</p>
<p>that does NAS storage devices, and they got hacked.</p>
<p>And everybody that didn&rsquo;t update as of a week ago</p>
<p>from the point of the zero day hack, everybody got hacked.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s several thousand machines, and they asked,</p>
<p>you can get your data back if you pay,</p>
<p>I forget what it was, but it was,</p>
<p>it was about a couple thousand dollars.</p>
<p>And QNAP can get all the data back for their customers</p>
<p>if they pay, I think, two million dollars.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>But that came from me relying on the systems</p>
<p>of others for security.</p>
<p>I assumed this company would have their security handled,</p>
<p>but then that was a very valuable lesson to me.</p>
<p>I now have layers of security and also an understanding</p>
<p>which data is really important, which is somewhat important,</p>
<p>which is not that important, and layering that all together.</p>
<p>So just so you know, the US government, the military,</p>
<p>woke up to that exact same thing about two years ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still very new.</p>
<p>I mean, they were sourcing,</p>
<p>take night vision goggles, for example.</p>
<p>They were sourcing components and engineering</p>
<p>and blueprints for night vision goggles</p>
<p>from three, four, five different subcontractors</p>
<p>all over the country, but they never asked themselves</p>
<p>what the security status was of those subcontractors.</p>
<p>So fast forward a few years, and all of a sudden,</p>
<p>they start getting faulty components.</p>
<p>They start having night vision goggles that don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>They start having supply chain issues</p>
<p>where they have to change their provider,</p>
<p>and the army doesn&rsquo;t know that the provider is changing.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a strategy.</p>
<p>The idea of going through third party systems</p>
<p>is identifying the vulnerability in the supply chain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a savvy offensive practice</p>
<p>for more than just cyber hackers.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about physical hacking.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m now, like I&rsquo;m an introvert,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m paranoid about all social interaction,</p>
<p>but how much truth is there?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a funny question.</p>
<p>How suspicious should I be when I&rsquo;m traveling in Ukraine</p>
<p>or different parts of the world</p>
<p>when an attractive female walks up to me</p>
<p>and shows any kind of attention?</p>
<p>Is that like this kind of James Bond spy movie stuff,</p>
<p>or is that kind of stuff used by intelligence agencies?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s used.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely used.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called sexpionage.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the term that we jokingly call it, is sexpionage.</p>
<p>But yeah, the art of attraction, appeal,</p>
<p>the manifestation of feelings through sexual manipulation,</p>
<p>all of that is a super powerful tool.</p>
<p>The Chinese use it extremely well.</p>
<p>The Russians use it extremely well.</p>
<p>In the United States,</p>
<p>we actively train our officers not to use it</p>
<p>because in the end it leads to complications</p>
<p>in how you professionally run a case.</p>
<p>So we train our officers not to use it.</p>
<p>However, you can&rsquo;t control what other people think.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re an attractive male</p>
<p>or an attractive female officer,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to talk to an older general</p>
<p>who just happens to be gay or happens to be straight</p>
<p>and is attracted to you,</p>
<p>of course they&rsquo;re gonna be that much more willing</p>
<p>to talk to an American who is also attractive.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard to walk that back.</p>
<p>In all definitions.</p>
<p>So it could be all elements of charisma.</p>
<p>So attractiveness in a dynamic sense of the word.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s visual attractiveness,</p>
<p>but the smile, the humor, the wit, the flirting,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff that could be used</p>
<p>to the art of conversation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also elements of sexuality</p>
<p>that people underestimate, right?</p>
<p>So physical sexuality, physical attraction</p>
<p>is the most obvious one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the one that everybody talks about and thinks about.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s also sapiosexuality,</p>
<p>which is being sexually attracted to thoughts,</p>
<p>to intelligence.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got all the various varieties</p>
<p>of personal preferences.</p>
<p>Some people like people of a certain color skin,</p>
<p>or they like big noses, they like small noses,</p>
<p>they like big butts, they like small butts,</p>
<p>they like tall guys, they like bald guys,</p>
<p>whatever it might be.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t ever predict what someone&rsquo;s preferences,</p>
<p>sexual arousal preferences are going to be.</p>
<p>So then you end up walking into a situation</p>
<p>where then you discover, and just imagine,</p>
<p>imagine being an unattractive, overweight, married guy,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re walking into an asset or a target meeting</p>
<p>with like a middle aged female</p>
<p>who is also not very attractive and also married.</p>
<p>But then it turns out that that person is a sapiosexual</p>
<p>and gets extremely turned on by intelligent conversation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what you&rsquo;re there to do.</p>
<p>Your mission is to have intelligent conversation</p>
<p>with this person to find out if they have access to secrets.</p>
<p>And by virtue of you carrying out your mission,</p>
<p>they become extremely aroused and attracted to you.</p>
<p>That is a very complicated situation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know who to trust.</p>
<p>Like, how do you know your wife,</p>
<p>or how does your wife know</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not a double agent from Russia?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a large element of experience and time</p>
<p>that goes into that.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s also trained.</p>
<p>And I think my wife and I also.</p>
<p>Actually you think.</p>
<p>My wife and I also have the benefit</p>
<p>of being recruited young and together where.</p>
<p>So over time you can start to figure out things</p>
<p>that are very difficult to.</p>
<p>So you form the baseline,</p>
<p>you start to understand the person&rsquo;s very,</p>
<p>it becomes very difficult to lie.</p>
<p>The most difficult thing in the world is consistency.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most difficult thing in the world.</p>
<p>Some people say that discipline or self discipline,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re really talking about is consistency.</p>
<p>When you have someone who performs consistently</p>
<p>over long periods of time, under various levels of stress,</p>
<p>you have high, high confidence</p>
<p>that that is the person that you can trust.</p>
<p>You can trust, again,</p>
<p>you can trust them to behave within a certain pattern.</p>
<p>You can trust an asshole to be an asshole</p>
<p>without trusting the asshole</p>
<p>to take care of your kids, right?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t ever wanna mix up the idea of personal trust</p>
<p>versus trusting the outcome.</p>
<p>You can always trust a person</p>
<p>to operate within their pattern of behavior.</p>
<p>It just takes time for you to get a consistent,</p>
<p>to get consistent feedback</p>
<p>as to what that baseline is for them.</p>
<p>To form a good model, predictive model</p>
<p>of what their behavior is going to be like.</p>
<p>Right, and you know, it&rsquo;s fascinating is I think</p>
<p>the challenge is building that model quickly.</p>
<p>So technology is one of those tools</p>
<p>that will be able in the future</p>
<p>to very quickly create a model of behavior</p>
<p>because technology can pull in multiple data points</p>
<p>in a very short period of time</p>
<p>that the human brain simply can&rsquo;t pull in</p>
<p>at the same space, at the same speed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually what I did my PhD on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I did at Google</p>
<p>is forming a good representation,</p>
<p>unique representation in the entire world</p>
<p>based on the behavior of the person.</p>
<p>The specific task there is</p>
<p>so that you don&rsquo;t have to type in the password.</p>
<p>The idea was to replace the password.</p>
<p>But it also allows you to actually study human behavior</p>
<p>and to think, all right,</p>
<p>what is the unique representation of a person?</p>
<p>How, because we have very specific patterns</p>
<p>and a lot of humans are very similar in those patterns,</p>
<p>what are the unique identifiers</p>
<p>within those patterns of behavior?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s, from a psychology perspective,</p>
<p>a super fascinating question.</p>
<p>And from a machine learning perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something that you can,</p>
<p>as the systems get better and better and better,</p>
<p>and as we get more and more digital data</p>
<p>about each individual, you start to get,</p>
<p>you start to be able to do that kind of thing effectively.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, I mean, when I think of the fact</p>
<p>that you could create a dossier on somebody</p>
<p>in a matter of 24 or 48 hours,</p>
<p>if you could wire them for two days, right?</p>
<p>Internet of Things style,</p>
<p>you put it in their underwear or whatever, right?</p>
<p>Some chip that just reads everything.</p>
<p>How heavy are they walking?</p>
<p>How much time do they sleep?</p>
<p>How many times do they open the refrigerator?</p>
<p>When they log into their computer, how do they do it?</p>
<p>Like, which hand do they use when they log in?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s their most common swipe?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s their most visited website?</p>
<p>You could collect an enormous amount of normative data</p>
<p>in a short period of time where otherwise we&rsquo;re stuck.</p>
<p>The way that we do it now, once or twice a week,</p>
<p>we go out for a coffee for two hours.</p>
<p>And two hours at a time over the course of six,</p>
<p>eight weeks, 12 weeks, you&rsquo;re coming up with a 50%</p>
<p>assessment on how you think this person is going to behave.</p>
<p>Just that time savings is immense.</p>
<p>Something you&rsquo;ve also spoken about is private intelligence</p>
<p>and the power and the reach and the scale</p>
<p>and the importance of private intelligence</p>
<p>versus government intelligence.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate on the role of what is private intelligence</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s the role of private intelligence</p>
<p>in the scope of all the intelligence</p>
<p>that is gathered and used in the United States?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that so few people know about.</p>
<p>And it became a more mainstream topic</p>
<p>with the Trump administration.</p>
<p>Because Trump made it no secret that he was going to hire</p>
<p>private intelligence organizations</p>
<p>to run his intelligence operations.</p>
<p>And fund them.</p>
<p>So that really brought it to the mainstream.</p>
<p>But going all the way back to 9 11,</p>
<p>going all the way back to 2001,</p>
<p>when the 9 11 attacks happened,</p>
<p>there was a commission that was formed</p>
<p>to determine the reasons that 9 11 happened.</p>
<p>And among the lists that they determined,</p>
<p>of course they found out that the intelligence community</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t coordinating well with each other.</p>
<p>There were fiefdoms and there was infighting</p>
<p>and there wasn&rsquo;t good intel sharing.</p>
<p>But more than that, they identified</p>
<p>that we were operating at Cold War levels,</p>
<p>even though we were living in a time</p>
<p>when terrorism was the new biggest threat</p>
<p>to national security.</p>
<p>So the big recommendation coming out of the 9 11 commission</p>
<p>was that the intelligence organizations,</p>
<p>the intelligence community significantly increased</p>
<p>the presence of intelligence operators overseas</p>
<p>and in terms of analytical capacity</p>
<p>here in the United States.</p>
<p>When they made that decision,</p>
<p>it completely destroyed, it totally was incongruent</p>
<p>with the existing hiring process</p>
<p>because the existing hiring process for CIA or NSA</p>
<p>is a six to nine month process.</p>
<p>The only way they could plus up their sizes fast enough</p>
<p>was to bypass their own hiring</p>
<p>and instead go direct to private organizations.</p>
<p>So naturally the government contracted with the companies</p>
<p>that they already had secure contracts with,</p>
<p>Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Khaki, you name it.</p>
<p>And then over time from 2001 to now,</p>
<p>or I guess that started really in 2004</p>
<p>when they started significantly increasing</p>
<p>the presence of private intelligence officers.</p>
<p>From then until now, it&rsquo;s become a budgetary thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become a continuity of operations thing.</p>
<p>And now the reason Northern Virginia</p>
<p>has become one of the wealthiest zip codes in America</p>
<p>is because of the incredible concentration</p>
<p>of private intelligence that is supporting CIA, NSA,</p>
<p>DIA, FBI, and all the slew of IC partners.</p>
<p>By the way, does Palantir play a role in this?</p>
<p>Palantir is one of those organizations</p>
<p>that was trying to pitch their product</p>
<p>to an intelligence community because they have,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fantastic product on paper.</p>
<p>But the challenge was the proprietary services,</p>
<p>the proprietary systems that we current that we used</p>
<p>in CIA prior to Palantir continued to outperform Palantir.</p>
<p>So just like any other business decision,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve got homegrown systems</p>
<p>that outperform external systems,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s not worth it to share the internal information.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So what the close connection between Peter Thiel</p>
<p>and Donald Trump, did that have a role to play</p>
<p>in Donald Trump&rsquo;s leveraging of private intelligence</p>
<p>or is that completely disjoint?</p>
<p>I think that they&rsquo;re related but only circumstantially.</p>
<p>Because remember, Donald Trump</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t really investing in CIA.</p>
<p>So the last thing he wanted to do</p>
<p>was spend his network, WASTA,</p>
<p>WASTA is a term that we call influence,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an Arabic term for influence.</p>
<p>Trump didn&rsquo;t wanna use his WASTA putting Thiel into CIA</p>
<p>only to lose Thiel&rsquo;s contract</p>
<p>as soon as Trump left office.</p>
<p>So instead, it was more valuable to put Peter Thiel&rsquo;s tool</p>
<p>to use in private intelligence.</p>
<p>And then of course, I think he nominated Peter Thiel</p>
<p>to be his Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State.</p>
<p>At some point in time, he tried to present,</p>
<p>like presidentially appoint Peter Thiel</p>
<p>into a position of government authority.</p>
<p>What do you think of figures like Peter Thiel?</p>
<p>Do they wield, and I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s figures</p>
<p>of similar scale and reach and power</p>
<p>in private intelligence.</p>
<p>What do you think about their role and power</p>
<p>in this whole, like without public accountability</p>
<p>that you would think directors of CIA perhaps have?</p>
<p>So this is where private intelligence</p>
<p>has both a strength and a weakness.</p>
<p>The ultimate law overriding,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s overseeing private intelligence</p>
<p>is not government legislation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the law of economics.</p>
<p>If they produce a superior product,</p>
<p>then they will have a buyer.</p>
<p>If they do not produce a superior product,</p>
<p>they will not have a buyer.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very simple business principle.</p>
<p>Whereas in the current national security infrastructure,</p>
<p>you can create a crap product,</p>
<p>but the taxpayer dollars are always going to be spent.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really thrown things for a loop.</p>
<p>Especially during the Trump administration.</p>
<p>And this is one of the things that I will always say</p>
<p>I liked about the Trump administration.</p>
<p>It shown, it put a big blazing bright light</p>
<p>on all of the flaws within our system.</p>
<p>One of those flaws being this executive power</p>
<p>over the intelligence organizations</p>
<p>and the lack of accountability</p>
<p>for intelligence organizations to produce a superior product.</p>
<p>When that light got shown down,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you also saw Trump start to go after,</p>
<p>if you remember, there was a period</p>
<p>where he was taking security clearances away</p>
<p>from retiring officers.</p>
<p>That became a big hot issue.</p>
<p>That became something that people were very opposed to</p>
<p>when they didn&rsquo;t realize that that process</p>
<p>of taking security clearances away,</p>
<p>that incentivized seasoned senior officers</p>
<p>to stay in service.</p>
<p>Because with private intelligence</p>
<p>paying a premium during the Trump administration,</p>
<p>because Trump was paying a premium</p>
<p>to the private intelligence world,</p>
<p>when senior officers found that it was more profitable</p>
<p>to retire early, keep their clearance,</p>
<p>and go work for Raytheon, Trump saw that</p>
<p>as bypassing service to the American people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve made a career in CIA, you&rsquo;ve made a career in NSA,</p>
<p>you should stay there.</p>
<p>If you leave, you lose your clearance</p>
<p>because you no longer have a need to know.</p>
<p>He upset the apple cart with that.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, the narrative that came out</p>
<p>in many ways was a negative narrative against Trump,</p>
<p>when in fact, he was actually doing quite a service</p>
<p>to the American people, trying to take away</p>
<p>the incentive of senior officials leaving their service</p>
<p>in order to just profiteer in the private intelligence.</p>
<p>So in that way, he was kind of supporting the CIA</p>
<p>in making sure that competent people</p>
<p>and experienced people stay in CIA,</p>
<p>are incentivized to stay there.</p>
<p>Correct, I think that there was definitely,</p>
<p>he understood incentives.</p>
<p>I mean, Donald Trump understands incentives.</p>
<p>So he was trying to incentivize them to stay,</p>
<p>but I think he was also playing a safety card</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t want former CIA officials</p>
<p>who were not listening to him</p>
<p>to then move into private intel organizations</p>
<p>that he may be hiring, only to then have them undermine him</p>
<p>from both sides of the coin.</p>
<p>So there was a little bit of offensive calculation</p>
<p>in there as well.</p>
<p>But do the dynamics and the incentives of economics</p>
<p>that you referred to that the private intelligence</p>
<p>operates under, is that more or less ethical</p>
<p>than the forces that maybe government agencies operate under?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your intuition?</p>
<p>Is capitalism lead, so you mentioned it leads</p>
<p>to maximizations of efficiency and performance,</p>
<p>but is that correlated with ethical behavior</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re talking about such hairy activities</p>
<p>like collection of intelligence?</p>
<p>The question of ethics is a great question.</p>
<p>So let me start this whole thing out by saying,</p>
<p>CIA hires people on a spectrum</p>
<p>of our ability to be morally flexible, ethically flexible.</p>
<p>All people at their heart are ethically flexible.</p>
<p>I would never punch somebody in the face, right?</p>
<p>Some people out there would say,</p>
<p>I would never hurt another human being.</p>
<p>But as soon as a human being posed a direct threat</p>
<p>to their daughter or their son or their mother,</p>
<p>now all of a sudden they&rsquo;re gonna change</p>
<p>their ethical stance in self defense, right?</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still hurting another person.</p>
<p>So what CIA looks for is people who are able</p>
<p>to swing across that spectrum for lesser offenses, right?</p>
<p>More flexibility.</p>
<p>I do not believe that private intelligence</p>
<p>and the laws of economics lend themselves</p>
<p>to increased ethics or increased ethical behavior</p>
<p>in the short term.</p>
<p>But what ends up happening is that in the long term,</p>
<p>in order to scale economic benefits,</p>
<p>you are forced to act within norms of your customer base.</p>
<p>So as the norms of that customer base</p>
<p>dictate certain requirements,</p>
<p>the company has to adapt to those requirements</p>
<p>in order to continue to scale.</p>
<p>So if a company tries to ostracize LGBTQ</p>
<p>or if they try to ostracize men or ostracize women,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re limiting their ability to grow economically.</p>
<p>They have to adapt to whatever is the prevailing</p>
<p>ethical requirement of their customer base.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such an interesting question</p>
<p>because you look at big pharma and pharmaceutical companies,</p>
<p>and they have quite a poor reputation in the public eye.</p>
<p>And some of it, maybe much of it is deserved,</p>
<p>at least historically speaking.</p>
<p>And so you start to wonder, well,</p>
<p>can intelligence agencies use some of the same methods</p>
<p>or can these use some of the same technique</p>
<p>to manipulate the public,</p>
<p>like what they believe about those agencies</p>
<p>in order to maximize profit as well?</p>
<p>Sort of finding shortcuts or unethical paths</p>
<p>that allow you to not be ultimately</p>
<p>responsible to the customer.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And I would go a step further to say that</p>
<p>the covert nature of intelligence operations</p>
<p>is really attractive when it comes to the private sector,</p>
<p>because now they have all the same money</p>
<p>with none of the oversight,</p>
<p>and all they have to do is deliver.</p>
<p>So without the oversight, what&rsquo;s holding you back?</p>
<p>And for anybody who&rsquo;s ever run a business,</p>
<p>anybody who&rsquo;s ever started a startup</p>
<p>or tried to make something succeed,</p>
<p>we all know that there come those times</p>
<p>where you have to skirt the boundaries</p>
<p>of propriety or morality or commitments</p>
<p>or promises to other people,</p>
<p>because at the end of the day,</p>
<p>if your business fails, it&rsquo;s on you.</p>
<p>So if you promise to deliver something to a client,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to deliver it to the client,</p>
<p>even if that means you stay up late</p>
<p>or if you lie on your taxes, whatever it might be,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain level of do or die.</p>
<p>Yeah, I personally have a sort of optimistic view</p>
<p>that ultimately the best way is to stay</p>
<p>within the ethical bounds, kind of like what you suggested.</p>
<p>If you want to be a company that&rsquo;s extremely successful,</p>
<p>is win with competence, not with cheating,</p>
<p>because cheating won&rsquo;t, I believe, win in the long term.</p>
<p>But in terms of being publicly responsible</p>
<p>to your decisions, I mean, I&rsquo;ve already been supposed</p>
<p>to talk to Peter Thiel twice on this podcast,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just been complicated.</p>
<p>If I were to put myself into his shoes,</p>
<p>why do podcasts?</p>
<p>The risk is too high to be a public person at all.</p>
<p>And so I totally understand that.</p>
<p>At the same time, I think if you&rsquo;re doing things</p>
<p>by the book and you&rsquo;re the best in the world at your job,</p>
<p>then you have nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>And you can advertise that and you recruit,</p>
<p>you help recruit, I mean, that&rsquo;s the work of capitalism</p>
<p>is you want to advertise that this is the place</p>
<p>where the best people in the world at this thing work.</p>
<p>True, I think that your point of view is accurate.</p>
<p>I would also say that the complexities</p>
<p>of what makes somebody make a decision</p>
<p>can only really be properly calculated with a baseline.</p>
<p>So because there is no baseline</p>
<p>that you or I have on Peter Thiel,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s difficult to really ascertain why he does</p>
<p>or doesn&rsquo;t accept invites or why he does or doesn&rsquo;t appear.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask your opinion on the NSA,</p>
<p>and then maybe you could mention</p>
<p>about bulk collection in general in the CIA,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s look at some history with the NSA and Snowden.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your opinion on the mass surveillance</p>
<p>that is reported to have been conducted by the NSA?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about ethics.</p>
<p>Are you troubled by the, from a public perception,</p>
<p>the unethical nature of mass surveillance</p>
<p>of especially American citizens?</p>
<p>This is a topic that I never get tired of talking about,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very rare that anyone ever really agrees with me,</p>
<p>just so you know.</p>
<p>I see where you&rsquo;re, well, I think there&rsquo;s a nuance thing</p>
<p>here and maybe we&rsquo;ll find some agreement.</p>
<p>The truth is that the American experience after 9 11</p>
<p>is nothing like the American experience now.</p>
<p>So all the terminology, all the talk about privacy</p>
<p>and privacy laws and mass surveillance</p>
<p>and all this other stuff,</p>
<p>it was a completely different time then.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not to say it was an excuse,</p>
<p>because to this day, I will still say mass collection,</p>
<p>bulk collection of data that allows</p>
<p>for an expedient identification of a threat</p>
<p>to national security benefits all of us,</p>
<p>but people don&rsquo;t understand what they want.</p>
<p>Like people don&rsquo;t understand what the value</p>
<p>of their own privacy is.</p>
<p>First of all, the fact that people think</p>
<p>they have personal privacy is laughable.</p>
<p>You have no privacy.</p>
<p>The cell phone that you carry in your pocket,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re giving permission to those apps constantly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re giving commercial organizations,</p>
<p>what you and I have already said,</p>
<p>are less tied to ethical responsibility.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re giving them permission to collect enormous amounts</p>
<p>of private data from you all the time.</p>
<p>And do you know what happens if AT&amp;T or Verizon</p>
<p>sees some nefarious activity on your account?</p>
<p>They do nothing.</p>
<p>They might send a note to FBI because they have to,</p>
<p>according to some checklist.</p>
<p>But when NSA was collecting intelligence</p>
<p>on metadata from around the United States,</p>
<p>they were very specifically looking for terrorist threats</p>
<p>that would harm American lives.</p>
<p>Man, NSA can clone my phone.</p>
<p>I will give them my children&rsquo;s phone.</p>
<p>I will give them the passwords to every one of my accounts</p>
<p>if it means that there&rsquo;s a likelihood</p>
<p>that my family will be safer from a nefarious actor</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s intent on hurting us.</p>
<p>NSA doesn&rsquo;t care about your affair.</p>
<p>NSA doesn&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re cheating on your taxes.</p>
<p>NSA doesn&rsquo;t care if you talk shit about your boss</p>
<p>or if you hate the US president.</p>
<p>Nobody cares about that.</p>
<p>Your intelligence community is there</p>
<p>to find threats to national security.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re there to do.</p>
<p>What Snowden did when he outed that whole program,</p>
<p>the fact that the court, the justice system,</p>
<p>the civilian justice system went back</p>
<p>and essentially overruled the ruling</p>
<p>of the intelligence courts before them</p>
<p>just goes to show how the general mass community</p>
<p>really shouldn&rsquo;t have a say</p>
<p>in what happens in the intelligence community.</p>
<p>They really shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You have politicians and you have the opportunity</p>
<p>to elect people to a position and then you trust them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what a representative republic is.</p>
<p>You vote the people in,</p>
<p>you trust them to work on your behalf.</p>
<p>They make decisions without running them by you.</p>
<p>They make decisions that they believe</p>
<p>are in the best interest of their constituency</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how our form of democracy works.</p>
<p>It worked, we were safer.</p>
<p>Now that we don&rsquo;t have that information</p>
<p>and now that there&rsquo;s this giant looming question</p>
<p>of whether or not NSA is there to serve people</p>
<p>or is collecting mass surveillance</p>
<p>against all American people,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not really a true accurate representation</p>
<p>of what they were ever doing.</p>
<p>They were looking for the needle in a haystack</p>
<p>of the series of transactions in metadata</p>
<p>that was going to lead to American deaths.</p>
<p>We are now less secure because they can&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>and that bothers me.</p>
<p>So you said a few really interesting things there.</p>
<p>So because you are kind of an insider,</p>
<p>or were for a time an insider, meaning you were able</p>
<p>to build up an intuition about the good, the bad,</p>
<p>and the ugly of these institutions, specifically the good.</p>
<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t have a good sense of the good.</p>
<p>They know the bad and the ugly</p>
<p>or can infer the bad and the ugly.</p>
<p>You mentioned that the one little key little thing there</p>
<p>at the end saying the NSA doesn&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>about whether you hate the president or not.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s what people really worry about</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re not sure they can trust the government</p>
<p>to not go into full dictatorial mode</p>
<p>and basing your political preference, your oppositions,</p>
<p>your, basically one of the essential powers,</p>
<p>the freedom of speech in the United States</p>
<p>is the ability to criticize your government.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And that, they worry, well, can&rsquo;t the government</p>
<p>get a hold of the NSA and start to ask the basic question,</p>
<p>well, can you give me a list of people</p>
<p>that are criticizing the government?</p>
<p>Think about, so let&rsquo;s just walk through that exact example,</p>
<p>right, because this is, it&rsquo;s a preponderance,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a preponderance fear, it&rsquo;s a ridiculous fear</p>
<p>because you would have to tap on multiple elements</p>
<p>of government for anything to happen.</p>
<p>So for example, let&rsquo;s just say that somebody goes</p>
<p>to the NSA and says, hey, can you give us a readout</p>
<p>on all the people who are tweeting terrible things</p>
<p>about the president?</p>
<p>Okay, cool, here&rsquo;s your hundred million people,</p>
<p>whatever it is, right?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s all the people saying negative things</p>
<p>about the government.</p>
<p>So now they have a list, what do they do next?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s just make it simple.</p>
<p>They stay with NSA and they say, surveil them even more,</p>
<p>tap their phones, tap their computers,</p>
<p>I wanna know even more.</p>
<p>So then they get this preponderance of evidence.</p>
<p>What do you do with evidence?</p>
<p>You take it to a court.</p>
<p>Well, guess what no court is going to support?</p>
<p>Anything that goes against the freedom of speech.</p>
<p>So the court is not going to support</p>
<p>what the executive is asking them to do.</p>
<p>Even before you take somebody to court,</p>
<p>you have to involve law enforcement.</p>
<p>Essentially, you have to send some sort of police force</p>
<p>to go apprehend the individual who&rsquo;s in question.</p>
<p>Well, guess what doesn&rsquo;t meet criteria</p>
<p>for any police force anywhere in the United States?</p>
<p>Arresting people who say negative things</p>
<p>about the president.</p>
<p>Now, if somebody poses a threat to the life</p>
<p>of a public figure or the threat to life of a politician,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a completely different case,</p>
<p>which means the standards of evidence are much higher</p>
<p>for them to arrest that person.</p>
<p>So unless you create a secret police force,</p>
<p>then your actual public police force</p>
<p>is never gonna take action.</p>
<p>So all these people who are afraid of this exact situation</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re outlying,</p>
<p>they need the creation of a secret police force,</p>
<p>the creation of a secret court</p>
<p>that operates outside the judicial system,</p>
<p>the creation of a secret intelligence service</p>
<p>that operates outside of foreign intelligence collection,</p>
<p>all so that a handful of people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t like the president get what?</p>
<p>Whisked away, assassinated, put in prison, who knows what?</p>
<p>Think about the resources that would be,</p>
<p>the amount of money and time</p>
<p>and how hard would it be to keep that secret,</p>
<p>to have all of those things in motion.</p>
<p>The reason it worked in Russia and Soviet Germany</p>
<p>or Russia and communist Germany</p>
<p>was because everybody knew there was a secret police.</p>
<p>Everybody knew that there was a threat</p>
<p>to work to speaking out against the government.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely different here.</p>
<p>Well, so there&rsquo;s a lot to say.</p>
<p>So one is yes, if I was a dictator</p>
<p>and I wanted to, and just looking at history,</p>
<p>let me take myself out of it,</p>
<p>but I think one of the more effective ways</p>
<p>is you don&rsquo;t need the surveillance.</p>
<p>You can pick out a random person</p>
<p>and in a public display, semi public display,</p>
<p>basically put them in jail for opposing the government,</p>
<p>whether they oppose it or not,</p>
<p>and the fear, that sends a message to a lot of people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what you see happening in China.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you just light out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s genius, and that is the standard.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need the surveillance for that.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>But that said, if you did do the surveillance,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s the support, the sort of,</p>
<p>the incentives aren&rsquo;t aligned.</p>
<p>It seems like a lot of work to do</p>
<p>for the thing you could do without the surveillance.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But yes, the courts wouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>if you were to be able to get a list of people,</p>
<p>which I think that part you could do.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>That oppose the government.</p>
<p>You could do that just like you said on Twitter publicly.</p>
<p>You could make a list.</p>
<p>And with that, you can start to,</p>
<p>especially if you have a lot of data on those people,</p>
<p>find ways in which they did violate the law.</p>
<p>Not because they oppose the government,</p>
<p>but because in some other way.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll park your tickets or didn&rsquo;t pay the taxes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably a common one,</p>
<p>or like screwed up something about the taxes.</p>
<p>I just happen to know Russia and Ukraine,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very good at this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Knowing how the citizens screwed everything up,</p>
<p>because especially in those countries,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s breaking the law.</p>
<p>Because in a corrupt nation,</p>
<p>you have to bend the law to operate the war.</p>
<p>The number of people that pay taxes fully</p>
<p>in those nations is just very low, not zero.</p>
<p>And so they then use that breaking of the law</p>
<p>to come up with an excuse to actually put you in jail</p>
<p>based on that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s possible to imagine.</p>
<p>But yes, I think,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the ugly part of surveillance.</p>
<p>But I do think, just like you said,</p>
<p>the incentives aren&rsquo;t correct.</p>
<p>Like you really don&rsquo;t need to get all of the secret police</p>
<p>and all of these kinds of organizations working.</p>
<p>If you do have a charismatic, powerful leader</p>
<p>that built up a network that&rsquo;s able to control</p>
<p>a lot of organizations to a level of authoritarianism</p>
<p>in a government, they&rsquo;re just able to do the usual thing.</p>
<p>One, have propaganda machine to tell narratives.</p>
<p>Two, pick out people that they can put in jail</p>
<p>for opposing the state.</p>
<p>And maybe loud members of the press</p>
<p>start silencing the press.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a playbook to this thing.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t require the surveillance.</p>
<p>The surveillance, you know what is useful</p>
<p>for the surveillance is the thing you mentioned in China,</p>
<p>which is encourage everybody in the citizenry</p>
<p>to watch each other,</p>
<p>to say there&rsquo;s enemies of the state everywhere.</p>
<p>And then you start having children reporting</p>
<p>on their appearance and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Again, don&rsquo;t need a surveillance state for that.</p>
<p>Now the good of a surveillance system,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s operating within ethical bounds,</p>
<p>is that yes, it could protect the populace.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying like the good given on your understanding</p>
<p>of these institutions, the good outweighs the bad.</p>
<p>Absolutely, so let me give you just a practical example.</p>
<p>So people don&rsquo;t realize this,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s multiple surveillance states that are out there.</p>
<p>There are surveillance states that are close allies</p>
<p>with the United States.</p>
<p>One of those surveillance states</p>
<p>is the United Arab Emirates, the UAE.</p>
<p>Now I lived in the UAE from 2019 to 2020,</p>
<p>came back on a repatriation flight after COVID broke out.</p>
<p>And, but we were there for a full year.</p>
<p>We were residents, we had IDs, we had everything.</p>
<p>Now, when you get your national ID in the Emirates,</p>
<p>you get a chip and that chip connects you to everything.</p>
<p>It connects you to cameras,</p>
<p>it connects you to your license plate on your car,</p>
<p>to your passport, to your credit card, everything.</p>
<p>Everything is intertwined, everything is interlinked.</p>
<p>When you drive, there are no police.</p>
<p>There are no police on the roads.</p>
<p>Every 50 to 100 meters, you cross a camera</p>
<p>that reads your license plate, measures your speed.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re breaking the speed limit,</p>
<p>it just immediately charges your credit card</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s tied, it&rsquo;s all tied together.</p>
<p>Totally surveillance.</p>
<p>That technology was invented by the Israelis</p>
<p>who use it in Israel.</p>
<p>When I was in Abu Dhabi and I was rear ended at high speed</p>
<p>by what turned out to be an Emirati official,</p>
<p>a senior ranking official of one of the Emirates.</p>
<p>It was caught on camera.</p>
<p>His ID was registered, my ID was registered.</p>
<p>Everything was tied back to our IDs.</p>
<p>The proof and the evidence was crystal clear.</p>
<p>Even still, he was Emirati, I was not.</p>
<p>So when I went to the police station to file the complaints,</p>
<p>it was something that nobody was comfortable with</p>
<p>because generally speaking,</p>
<p>Emiratis don&rsquo;t accept legal claims</p>
<p>against their own from foreigners.</p>
<p>But the difference was that I was an American</p>
<p>and I was there on a contract</p>
<p>supporting the Emirati government.</p>
<p>So I had these different variances, right?</p>
<p>Long story short, in the end,</p>
<p>the surveillance state is what made sure</p>
<p>that justice was played</p>
<p>because the proof was incontrovertible.</p>
<p>There was so much evidence collected</p>
<p>because of the surveillance nature of their state.</p>
<p>Now, why do they have a surveillance state?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not for people like me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re constantly afraid</p>
<p>of extremist terrorist activity happening inside Abu Dhabi</p>
<p>or inside the UAE</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re under constant threat from Islam</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re from extremists</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re under constant threat from Iran.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what drives the people to want a police state,</p>
<p>to want a surveillance state.</p>
<p>For them, their survival is paramount</p>
<p>and they need the surveillance to have that survival.</p>
<p>For us, we haven&rsquo;t tasted that level of desperation and fear</p>
<p>yet or hopefully never,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what makes us feel</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s something wrong with surveillance.</p>
<p>Surveillance is all about the purpose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about the intent.</p>
<p>Well, and like you said,</p>
<p>companies do a significant amount of surveillance</p>
<p>to provide us with services that we take for granted.</p>
<p>For example, just one of the things to give props</p>
<p>to the digital efforts</p>
<p>of the Zelensky administration in Ukraine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re aware,</p>
<p>but they have this digital transformation efforts</p>
<p>where you could put, there&rsquo;s an, it&rsquo;s laughable to say</p>
<p>in the United States,</p>
<p>but they actually did a really good job</p>
<p>by having a government app that has your passport on it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all the digital information.</p>
<p>You can get a doctor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like everything that you would think America</p>
<p>would be doing, like license, like all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in an app.</p>
<p>You could pay, there&rsquo;s payment to each other.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all coming, I mean,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably contractors somehow connected</p>
<p>to the whole thing,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s like under the flag of government.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s an incredible technology.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t, I guess, hear anybody talk about surveillance</p>
<p>in that context, even though it is, but they all love it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s super easy.</p>
<p>And they, frankly already, it&rsquo;s so easy and convenient.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve already taken for granted that,</p>
<p>of course, this is what you do.</p>
<p>Of course, your passport is on your phone.</p>
<p>For everybody to have housed in a server</p>
<p>that you have no idea where it&rsquo;s at,</p>
<p>that could be hacked at any time by a third party.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t ask these kinds of questions</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so convenient,</p>
<p>as we do for Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple,</p>
<p>Microsoft products we use.</p>
<p>Security and convenience are on two opposite sides</p>
<p>of another spectrum.</p>
<p>The more convenient something is, the less secure.</p>
<p>And the more secure something is, the less convenient.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a battle that we&rsquo;re always working</p>
<p>with as individuals, and then we&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to outsource that battle to our politicians.</p>
<p>And our politicians are, frankly,</p>
<p>just more interested in being politicians.</p>
<p>Yeah, that said, I mean, people are really worried</p>
<p>about giving any one institution a large amount of power,</p>
<p>especially when it&rsquo;s a federal government institution,</p>
<p>given some history.</p>
<p>First of all, just history of the corruption,</p>
<p>of power corrupting individuals and institutions.</p>
<p>And second of all, myth or reality of certain institutions</p>
<p>like the CIA misbehaving.</p>
<p>Well, let me actually ask you about the Edward Snowden.</p>
<p>So you, outside of the utility that you&rsquo;re arguing for</p>
<p>of the NSA surveillance program,</p>
<p>do you think Edward Snowden is a criminal or a hero?</p>
<p>In terms, in the eyes of the law, he&rsquo;s a criminal.</p>
<p>He broke the law, he broke the confidence,</p>
<p>he made us, he was under security obligation.</p>
<p>And then when he ran away, he ran away</p>
<p>to all of the worst villains in the world</p>
<p>from the US perspective to basically seek protection.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you act in the face of accusation</p>
<p>is in essence part of the case that you build for yourself.</p>
<p>So running away to China, Russia, Cuba,</p>
<p>there was a Latin Ecuador, I think,</p>
<p>that just paints a very negative picture</p>
<p>that does not suggest that you were doing anything</p>
<p>that was ethical and upright</p>
<p>and in favor of the American people</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna run to American enemies to support yourself.</p>
<p>So for sure, in the eyes of law, he&rsquo;s a criminal.</p>
<p>In the eyes of a group of people</p>
<p>who are largely ignorant to what they lost,</p>
<p>to them, he&rsquo;s a hero.</p>
<p>To me, he&rsquo;s just kind of a sad case.</p>
<p>I personally look at Snowden as a sad, unfortunate case.</p>
<p>His life is ruined, his family name is tarnished.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s forever going to be a desperate pawn.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all because of the decisions that he made</p>
<p>and the order that he made them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure his name is tarnished.</p>
<p>I think the case you&rsquo;re making is a difficult case to make.</p>
<p>And so I think his name represents fighting one man,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like Tiananmen Square standing before the tank,</p>
<p>is like one man fighting the government.</p>
<p>And I think that there is some aspect</p>
<p>which, taking that case aside,</p>
<p>that is the American spirit,</p>
<p>which is hold the powerful accountable.</p>
<p>So whenever there&rsquo;s somebody in power,</p>
<p>one individual can change.</p>
<p>One man can make a difference.</p>
<p>Can make a difference, yeah.</p>
<p>Very Knight Rider of you.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the American individualism.</p>
<p>And so he represents that.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a huge skepticism</p>
<p>against large federal institutions.</p>
<p>And I think if you look at the long arc of history,</p>
<p>that actually is a forcing function</p>
<p>for the institutions to behave their best.</p>
<p>So basically hold them accountable.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s nice about this is that we can agree to disagree</p>
<p>and history will be the one that decides.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a reason that Edward Snowden</p>
<p>needs to do something new every 16 or 18 months</p>
<p>to remain relevant, right?</p>
<p>Because if he didn&rsquo;t, he would just be forgotten.</p>
<p>Because he was not a maverick</p>
<p>who changed history for the better.</p>
<p>He was a man who broke a law and now he&rsquo;s on the run.</p>
<p>And to some people, he is a hero.</p>
<p>To other people, he is a criminal.</p>
<p>But to the vast majority, he&rsquo;s just a blip</p>
<p>on a radar of their everyday life</p>
<p>that really makes no difference to them at all.</p>
<p>So actually let&rsquo;s linger on that.</p>
<p>So just to clarify, do you think,</p>
<p>are you making the difficult case</p>
<p>that the NSA mass surveillance program</p>
<p>was one, ethical and two, made a better world for Americans?</p>
<p>I am making the case that at the time,</p>
<p>it was exactly what we needed to feel safe in our own homes.</p>
<p>But what about to be safe, actually be safe?</p>
<p>So this is what&rsquo;s difficult because any proof</p>
<p>that was that they collected</p>
<p>that actually prevented an attack from happening</p>
<p>is proof we&rsquo;ll never know about.</p>
<p>This is the really unfortunate side</p>
<p>of intelligence operations.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been at the front end of this.</p>
<p>You work your ass off.</p>
<p>You take personal risk.</p>
<p>You make personal sacrifice to make sure</p>
<p>that something terrible doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Nobody knows that that ever happens.</p>
<p>Does that have to be that way?</p>
<p>Does it have to remain secret</p>
<p>every time the NSA or the CIA saves the lives of Americans?</p>
<p>It does for two reasons.</p>
<p>It has to be secret.</p>
<p>First, the mythos.</p>
<p>The same thing we were talking about with General Petraeus.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t brag about your victories</p>
<p>if you want to let the myth shape itself.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>The second thing is once a victory is claimed,</p>
<p>the danger comes from letting your enemy know</p>
<p>that you claimed the victory</p>
<p>because they can reverse engineer</p>
<p>and they can start to change how they did things.</p>
<p>If a terrorist act, if a terrorist cell tries</p>
<p>to execute an operation and the operation fails,</p>
<p>from their point of view, they don&rsquo;t know why it failed.</p>
<p>They just know that it failed.</p>
<p>But then if the US or if the American government comes in</p>
<p>and says, we took apart this amazing attack,</p>
<p>now they have more information, right?</p>
<p>The whole power of secrets, like we talked about before,</p>
<p>the power of secrets is in knowing</p>
<p>that not everybody has them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only a shelf life.</p>
<p>So take advantage of the shelf life.</p>
<p>You get space.</p>
<p>So you gotta keep it a secret.</p>
<p>There is no tactical advantage from sharing a secret</p>
<p>unless you are specifically trying to achieve</p>
<p>a certain tactical advantage from sharing that secret,</p>
<p>which is what we&rsquo;ve seen so much of</p>
<p>with US intel sharing with Ukraine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tactical advantage from sharing a secret</p>
<p>about Russian military movements or weaknesses in tanks</p>
<p>or supply chain challenges, whatever it might be.</p>
<p>Well, let me argue that there might be an advantage</p>
<p>to share information with the American public</p>
<p>when a terrorist attack or is averted</p>
<p>or the lives of Americans are saved,</p>
<p>because what that does.</p>
<p>Is make every American think that they&rsquo;re not that safe.</p>
<p>There is no tactical advantage there.</p>
<p>You think so?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>What about?</p>
<p>If the Austin PD started telling you every day</p>
<p>about these crazy crimes that they prevented,</p>
<p>would that make you feel more safe?</p>
<p>It would make you feel like they&rsquo;re doing their job.</p>
<p>Is that obvious to you, make us feel less safe?</p>
<p>Because if we see competence,</p>
<p>that there is extremely competent defenders</p>
<p>of this territory of these people,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t that make us feel more safe or no?</p>
<p>The human nature is not to assign competence.</p>
<p>So empirically, humans overvalue losses</p>
<p>and undervalue gains.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that we&rsquo;ve seen from finance</p>
<p>to betting and beyond.</p>
<p>If the Austin Police Department starts telling you</p>
<p>about all these heinous crimes that were avoided</p>
<p>because of their hard work,</p>
<p>the way that your brain is actually going</p>
<p>to process that information is you are going to say,</p>
<p>if this is all the stuff that they&rsquo;ve stopped,</p>
<p>how bad must this place be?</p>
<p>How much more haven&rsquo;t they stopped?</p>
<p>I take your point, it&rsquo;s a powerful psychological point,</p>
<p>but looking at the other picture of it,</p>
<p>looking at the police force, looking at the CIA, the NSA,</p>
<p>those people, now with the police,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re seeing, there&rsquo;s such a negative feeling</p>
<p>amongst Americans towards these institutions.</p>
<p>Who the hell wants to work for the CIA now</p>
<p>and the police force?</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re gonna be criticized,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s a, I mean, that&rsquo;s really bad for the CIA.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>Like, as opposed to being seen as a hero,</p>
<p>like for example, currently soldiers are for the most part</p>
<p>seen as heroes that are protecting this nation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the case for the CIA.</p>
<p>Soldiers weren&rsquo;t seen as heroes in the Vietnam War, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to remember that when you,</p>
<p>so first of all, public service is a sacrifice.</p>
<p>We oftentimes forget that.</p>
<p>We start to think, oh, government jobs are cushy</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re easy, and it must be so easy</p>
<p>to be the president,</p>
<p>because then you&rsquo;re basically a celebrity overnight.</p>
<p>Public service is a sacrifice, it&rsquo;s a grind.</p>
<p>For all of the soldiers, the submariners,</p>
<p>the missileers, the police officers,</p>
<p>intelligence specialists,</p>
<p>they all know what it&rsquo;s like to give things up,</p>
<p>to serve a public that can turn its opinion</p>
<p>at any given time.</p>
<p>And history is what defines it.</p>
<p>The more important thing is to understand that</p>
<p>if you want a true open and fair democracy,</p>
<p>you cannot control a narrative.</p>
<p>And starting to share all of your victories</p>
<p>or starting to share your biggest victories</p>
<p>with the intent of shaping public opinion</p>
<p>to be supportive of the police force or supportive of CIA</p>
<p>or supportive of you name it, is shaping a narrative</p>
<p>that is intentional operational use of influence</p>
<p>to drive public opinion.</p>
<p>That is something nobody wants to get into.</p>
<p>It is much more professional to be a silent sentinel,</p>
<p>a silent servant, humbly carrying the burden</p>
<p>of public service in the United States</p>
<p>where we are a fair and open democracy.</p>
<p>Why, why not celebrate the killing of Bin Laden?</p>
<p>We did.</p>
<p>The search, discovery, and the capture</p>
<p>and the killing of Bin Laden.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t that, actually the details of that,</p>
<p>how much of the details of that,</p>
<p>how he was discovered were made public?</p>
<p>I think some of it was made public enough.</p>
<p>Why not do that?</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t that make heroes out of the people</p>
<p>that are servants?</p>
<p>Or do people who serve to do service for this nation,</p>
<p>do they always have to operate</p>
<p>in a thankless manner in the shadows?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a very good question.</p>
<p>The folks who I left behind when I left CIA,</p>
<p>who continue to serve as faceless,</p>
<p>nameless heroes every day, I am grateful to them.</p>
<p>The truth is that if they were motivated by something else,</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t be as good as they are at doing what they do.</p>
<p>And I see your point about,</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t we be celebrating our victories?</p>
<p>But when celebrating our victories</p>
<p>runs the risk of informing our enemies how we operate,</p>
<p>giving away our informational advantage,</p>
<p>giving away our tactical battlefield advantage,</p>
<p>and running the risk of shaping a narrative intentionally</p>
<p>among our own American people,</p>
<p>now all of a sudden we&rsquo;re turning into exactly the thing</p>
<p>that the American people trust us not to become.</p>
<p>Yeah, but then you operate in the secrecy,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s corrupt and douchebag people everywhere.</p>
<p>So when they, even inside the CIA and criminals,</p>
<p>inside the CIA there&rsquo;s criminals in all organizations,</p>
<p>in all walks of life, human nature as such,</p>
<p>that this is always the case,</p>
<p>then it breeds conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>And sometimes those conspiracy theories</p>
<p>turn out to be true.</p>
<p>But most times they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just part of the risk of being a myth.</p>
<p>Can you speak to some of the myths?</p>
<p>So MKUltra, so.</p>
<p>Not a myth.</p>
<p>So this is a fascinating human experimentation program</p>
<p>undertaken by the CIA to develop procedures</p>
<p>for using drugs like LSD to interrogate people</p>
<p>through, let&rsquo;s say, psychological manipulation</p>
<p>and maybe even torture.</p>
<p>The scale of the program is perhaps not known.</p>
<p>How do you make sense that this program existed?</p>
<p>Again, you&rsquo;ve gotta look through the lens of time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gotta look at where we were historically</p>
<p>at that time.</p>
<p>There was the peak of the Cold War.</p>
<p>Our enemies were doing the same kind of experimentation.</p>
<p>It was essentially another space race.</p>
<p>What if they broke through a new weapon technology</p>
<p>faster than we did?</p>
<p>What would that mean for the safety and security</p>
<p>of the American people?</p>
<p>So right decision or wrong decision,</p>
<p>it was guided by and informed</p>
<p>by national security priorities.</p>
<p>So from this program that was designed to use drugs</p>
<p>to drive interrogation and torture people</p>
<p>was born something very productive, Operation Stargate,</p>
<p>which was a chance to use remote viewing and metaphysics</p>
<p>to try to collect intelligence.</p>
<p>Now, even though in the end, the outcome of MKUltra</p>
<p>and the outcome of Stargate were mixed,</p>
<p>nobody really knows if they did or didn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>what they were supposed to do,</p>
<p>we still know that to this day,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still a demand in the US government and in CIA</p>
<p>for people who have sensitivities to ethereal energies.</p>
<p>By the way, is there any proof</p>
<p>that that kind of stuff works?</p>
<p>Or it just shows that there&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>It shows that there&rsquo;s openness</p>
<p>to consider those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But is there any evidence that that kind of stuff works?</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s evidence, I haven&rsquo;t seen it.</p>
<p>Speaking from a science based point of view only,</p>
<p>if energy and matter can always be exchanged,</p>
<p>then a person who can understand</p>
<p>and become sensitive to energy</p>
<p>is a person who could become sensitive</p>
<p>to what does become matter.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the basics of the physics might be there,</p>
<p>but a lot of people probably are skeptical.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m skeptical too, but I&rsquo;m just trying to look at it.</p>
<p>You should be open minded, right?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s actually, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what science is about, is remain open minded,</p>
<p>even for the things that are long shots,</p>
<p>because those are the things</p>
<p>that actually define scientific revolutions.</p>
<p>What about Operation Northwoods?</p>
<p>It was a proposed 1962 false flag operation</p>
<p>by the DOD and the CIA to be carried out by the CIA</p>
<p>to commit acts of terrorism on Americans</p>
<p>and blame them on Cuba.</p>
<p>So JFK, the president, rejected the proposal.</p>
<p>What do you make that this was on the table,</p>
<p>Operation Northwoods?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>First, I&rsquo;m glad that JFK rejected it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good sign.</p>
<p>So we have to understand that good ideas</p>
<p>are oftentimes born from bad ideas.</p>
<p>I had a really good friend of mine</p>
<p>who actually went on to become a pastor,</p>
<p>and he used to say all the time</p>
<p>that he wanted all the bad ideas on the table.</p>
<p>Like, give me all your bad ideas</p>
<p>every time we had any kind of conversation.</p>
<p>And I was always one of those people who was like,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t a bad idea just a waste of time?</p>
<p>And he was like, no,</p>
<p>because the best ideas oftentimes come from bad ideas.</p>
<p>So again, Cuban missile crisis,</p>
<p>mass hysteria in the United States</p>
<p>about nuclear war from Cuba,</p>
<p>missiles blowing up American cities faster</p>
<p>than we could even see them coming.</p>
<p>It makes sense to me that a president would go to,</p>
<p>especially the part of CIA,</p>
<p>which is the Special Activities Division,</p>
<p>it makes perfect sense to me</p>
<p>that the president would go to a division</p>
<p>called Special Activities,</p>
<p>whose job it is to create crazy ideas</p>
<p>that have presidential approval,</p>
<p>but nobody knows they exist.</p>
<p>So it makes sense that he would challenge a group like that</p>
<p>to come up with any wacky idea, right?</p>
<p>Come up with anything.</p>
<p>Just let&rsquo;s start with something,</p>
<p>because we can&rsquo;t bring nothing to the table.</p>
<p>We have to do something about this Cuban issue.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s how an operation like that</p>
<p>could reasonably be born.</p>
<p>Not because anybody wants to do it,</p>
<p>but because they were tasked by the president</p>
<p>to come up with five ideas.</p>
<p>And it was one of the ideas.</p>
<p>That still happens to this day.</p>
<p>The president will still come in,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;ll basically send out a notice</p>
<p>to his covert action arm.</p>
<p>And he will say, I need this.</p>
<p>And I need it on Wednesday.</p>
<p>And people have to come back with options</p>
<p>for the thing he asked for, a finding.</p>
<p>He will issue a presidential finding.</p>
<p>And then his covert action arms have to come back and say,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s how we would do this</p>
<p>and hide the hands of the Americans.</p>
<p>How gangster was it of JFK to reject it though?</p>
<p>His baller, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, that is a mic drop right there.</p>
<p>Nope, not doing that.</p>
<p>Yep, doing that.</p>
<p>A thing that crosses an ethical line,</p>
<p>even in a time where the human,</p>
<p>the entirety of human civilization hangs in a balance,</p>
<p>still forfeit that power.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful thing about the American experiment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a few times throughout the history</p>
<p>that this has happened,</p>
<p>including with our first president, George Washington.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask about JFK.</p>
<p>25 times two, and they still keep that stuff classified.</p>
<p>So do you think the CIA had a hand</p>
<p>in the assassination of JFK?</p>
<p>I cannot imagine in any reasonable point of view</p>
<p>that the organization of CIA had anything to do</p>
<p>with the assassination of JFK.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not possible to infiltrate the CIA,</p>
<p>a small part of the CIA in order to attain political</p>
<p>or criminal gains, or financial.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely it&rsquo;s possible to infiltrate CIA.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a long history of foreign intelligence services</p>
<p>infiltrating CIA, from Aldrich Ames</p>
<p>to Jerry Lee recently with China.</p>
<p>So we know CIA can be infiltrated,</p>
<p>even if they are infiltrated,</p>
<p>and even if that&rsquo;s interlocutor execution</p>
<p>that interlocutor executes on their own agenda</p>
<p>or the agenda as directed by their foreign adversary,</p>
<p>their foreign handler,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s different than organizational support for an event.</p>
<p>So I do think it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>they could have been infiltrated at the time,</p>
<p>especially it was a major priority</p>
<p>for the Cubans and the Russians</p>
<p>to infiltrate some aspect of US intelligence,</p>
<p>multiple moles were caught in the years following.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not surprising</p>
<p>that there would be a priority for that.</p>
<p>But to say that the organization of CIA</p>
<p>was somehow in cahoots with,</p>
<p>to independently assassinate their own executive,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a significant stretch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen no evidence to support that.</p>
<p>And it goes contrary to everything I learned</p>
<p>from my time at CIA.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you,</p>
<p>do you think CIA played a part in enabling drug cartels</p>
<p>and drug trafficking,</p>
<p>which is another big kind of</p>
<p>shadow that hangs over the CIA?</p>
<p>At the beginning of the drug war,</p>
<p>I would imagine the answer is yes.</p>
<p>CIA has its own counter narcotics division,</p>
<p>a division that&rsquo;s dedicated to fighting</p>
<p>and preventing narcotics</p>
<p>from coming into the United States.</p>
<p>So when you paint a picture for me,</p>
<p>like do you think the CIA was complicit</p>
<p>in helping drug trafficking or drug use?</p>
<p>When I say yes,</p>
<p>my exception is I don&rsquo;t think they did that</p>
<p>for Americans inside the United States.</p>
<p>If the CIA can basically set it up</p>
<p>so that two different drug cartels shoot each other</p>
<p>by assisting in the transaction</p>
<p>of a sale to a third country</p>
<p>and then leaking that that sale happened</p>
<p>to a competing cartel,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just letting cartels do what they do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s them doing the dirty work for us.</p>
<p>So especially at the beginning of the drug war,</p>
<p>I think there was tons of space,</p>
<p>lots of room for CIA to get involved</p>
<p>in the economics of drugs</p>
<p>and then let the inevitable happen.</p>
<p>And that was way more efficient,</p>
<p>way more productive than us trying to send our own troops</p>
<p>in to kill a bunch of cartel warlords.</p>
<p>So that makes a ton of sense to me.</p>
<p>It just seems efficient.</p>
<p>It seems very practical.</p>
<p>I do not believe that CIA would like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think all the accusations out there</p>
<p>about how they would buy drugs and sell drugs</p>
<p>and somehow make money on the side from it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how it works.</p>
<p>So do you think there&rsquo;s, on that point,</p>
<p>a connection between Barry Seal,</p>
<p>the great governor and then President Bill Clinton,</p>
<p>Oliver North and Vice President and former CIA Director</p>
<p>George H.W. Bush and the little town</p>
<p>with a little airport called Mena, Arkansas?</p>
<p>So I am out of my element now.</p>
<p>This is one I haven&rsquo;t heard many details about.</p>
<p>Okay, so your sense is any of the drug trafficking</p>
<p>has to do with criminal operations</p>
<p>outside of the United States and the CIA</p>
<p>just leveraging that to achieve its ends</p>
<p>but nothing to do with American citizens</p>
<p>and American politicians.</p>
<p>With American citizens, again, speaking organizationally.</p>
<p>So that would be my sense, yes.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about, so back to Operation Northwoods</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such a powerful tool,</p>
<p>sadly powerful tool used by dictators throughout history,</p>
<p>the false flag operation.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s, and you said the terrorist attacks</p>
<p>in 9 11 were, it changed a lot for us,</p>
<p>for the United States, for Americans.</p>
<p>It changed the way we see the world.</p>
<p>It woke us up to the harshness of the world.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s, to my eyes at least,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing that shows evidence</p>
<p>that 9 11 was a quote inside job.</p>
<p>But is the CIA or the intelligence agencies</p>
<p>or the US government capable of something like that?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the question.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bunch of shadiness</p>
<p>about how it was reported on.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s the thing I struggle with.</p>
<p>While there&rsquo;s no evidence that there was an inside job,</p>
<p>it raises the question to me,</p>
<p>well, could something like this be an inside job?</p>
<p>Because it sure as heck, now looking back 20 years,</p>
<p>the amount of money that was spent on these wars,</p>
<p>the military industrial complex,</p>
<p>the amount of interest in terms of power and money involved,</p>
<p>organizationally, can something like that happen?</p>
<p>You know Occam&rsquo;s razor.</p>
<p>So the harem&rsquo;s razor is that you can never prescribe</p>
<p>to conspiracy what could be explained through incompetence.</p>
<p>That is one of, those are two fundamental guidelines</p>
<p>that we follow all the time.</p>
<p>The simplest answer is oftentimes the best</p>
<p>and never prescribe to conspiracy</p>
<p>what can be explained through incompetence.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate what you mean by we?</p>
<p>We as intelligence professionals.</p>
<p>So you think there&rsquo;s a deep truth to that second razor?</p>
<p>There is more than a deep truth.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s ages of experience for me and for others.</p>
<p>So in general, people are incompetent.</p>
<p>If left to their own means they&rsquo;re more incompetent</p>
<p>than they are malevolent at a large organizational scale.</p>
<p>People are more incompetent of executing a conspiracy</p>
<p>than they are of competently, yeah,</p>
<p>than they are of competently executing a conspiracy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what it means is that it&rsquo;s so difficult</p>
<p>to carry out a complex lie</p>
<p>that most people don&rsquo;t have the competency to do it.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to lead thinking of conspiracy.</p>
<p>It makes more sense to lead assuming incompetence.</p>
<p>When you look at all of the outcomes,</p>
<p>all the findings from 9 11, it speaks to incompetence.</p>
<p>It speaks brashly and openly to incompetence</p>
<p>and nobody likes talking about it.</p>
<p>FBI and CIA to this day hate hearing about it.</p>
<p>The 9 11 commission is gonna go down in history</p>
<p>as this painful example of the incompetence</p>
<p>of the American intelligence community.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to come back again and again.</p>
<p>Every time there&rsquo;s an intel flap,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna come back again and again.</p>
<p>What are you seeing?</p>
<p>Even right now, we miss the US intelligence infrastructure,</p>
<p>misjudged Afghanistan, misjudged Hong Kong,</p>
<p>misjudged Ukraine&rsquo;s and Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Those were three massive misjudgments in a few years.</p>
<p>That speaks, it&rsquo;s just embarrassing.</p>
<p>Exactly right.</p>
<p>So all the sort of cover up looking things around 9 11</p>
<p>is just people being embarrassed by their failures.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re taking steps to cover anything up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just their own, it&rsquo;s a painful reminder</p>
<p>of their lack of competency at the time.</p>
<p>Now, I understand that conspiracy theorists</p>
<p>want to take inklings of information</p>
<p>and put them together in a way that is the most damning,</p>
<p>but that goes back to our point about overvaluing losses</p>
<p>and undervaluing gains.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just predictable human behavior.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about this because it comes up often.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m from MIT and there&rsquo;s a guy by the name</p>
<p>of Jeffrey Epstein that still troubles me to this day</p>
<p>that some of the people I respect</p>
<p>were interacted with this individual</p>
<p>and fell into his influence.</p>
<p>The charm, charisma, whatever the hell he used</p>
<p>to delude these people, he did so successfully.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very open minded about this thing.</p>
<p>I just, I would love to learn more,</p>
<p>but a lot of people tell me, a lot of people I respect,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s intelligence agencies behind this individual.</p>
<p>So they were using Jeffrey Epstein</p>
<p>for getting access to powerful people</p>
<p>and then to control and manipulate those powerful people.</p>
<p>The CIA, I believe, is not brought up as often as Mossad.</p>
<p>And so this goes back to the original aspect</p>
<p>of our conversation is how much each individual</p>
<p>intelligence agency is willing to go to control,</p>
<p>to manipulate, to achieve its means.</p>
<p>Do you think there is, can you educate me?</p>
<p>If, obviously you don&rsquo;t know, but you can bet,</p>
<p>what are the chances the intelligence agencies</p>
<p>are involved with the character of Jeffrey Epstein?</p>
<p>In some way, shape, or form with the character of Epstein,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 100% guaranteed that some intelligence organization</p>
<p>was involved, but let&rsquo;s talk about why.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about why, okay?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s multiple types of intelligence assets,</p>
<p>just like we were talking earlier.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s foreign intelligence reporting assets,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s access agents,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s agents of influence.</p>
<p>Three different categories of intelligence, right?</p>
<p>One is when you talk about foreign intelligence reporters,</p>
<p>these are people who have access to secrets</p>
<p>and their job is to give you their secrets</p>
<p>in exchange for gold or money or alcohol or prostitution</p>
<p>or whatever else, right?</p>
<p>Their job is to give you secrets</p>
<p>and then you pay them for the secrets.</p>
<p>Access agents, their job is to give you physical access</p>
<p>or digital access to something of interest to you.</p>
<p>So maybe they&rsquo;re the ones that open a door</p>
<p>that should have been locked and let you come in</p>
<p>and stick your thumb drive in the computer.</p>
<p>Or maybe they&rsquo;re the ones that share a phone number</p>
<p>with somebody and then they&rsquo;re just like,</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t tell them you got the phone number from me.</p>
<p>Their job is to give you access.</p>
<p>Then you have these agents of influence.</p>
<p>An agent of influence&rsquo;s job is to be part of your effort</p>
<p>to influence the outcomes in some way</p>
<p>that benefits your intelligence requirements, right?</p>
<p>Of these three types of people,</p>
<p>the least scrupulous and the most shady</p>
<p>is your agent of influence.</p>
<p>Because your agent of influence</p>
<p>understands exactly what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>They know they&rsquo;re working with one guy</p>
<p>and they know they&rsquo;re using the influence</p>
<p>to manipulate some other guy.</p>
<p>When it comes to powerful people,</p>
<p>especially wealthy, powerful people,</p>
<p>the only thing that interests them is power.</p>
<p>Money is not a challenge anymore.</p>
<p>Prestige, notoriety, none of those things are a challenge.</p>
<p>The rest of us, we&rsquo;re busy trying to make money.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re busy trying to build a reputation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re busy trying to build a career, keep a family afloat.</p>
<p>At the highest levels, they&rsquo;re bored.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need any of that.</p>
<p>The only thing that they care about</p>
<p>is being able to wield power.</p>
<p>So a character like Jeffrey Epstein</p>
<p>is exactly the kind of character</p>
<p>that the Chinese would want, the Russians would want,</p>
<p>Mossad would want, the French would want.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too easy because the man had access</p>
<p>to a wide range of American influential people.</p>
<p>For corporate espionage uses,</p>
<p>for economic espionage uses,</p>
<p>for national security espionage uses,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense</p>
<p>that a person like that wouldn&rsquo;t be targeted.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So the question is.</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Who, and whether, I think the really important distinction</p>
<p>here is was this person, was Jeffrey Epstein created,</p>
<p>or once he&rsquo;s achieved and built his network,</p>
<p>was he then infiltrated?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a really sort of important difference.</p>
<p>Like at which stage do you connect a person like that?</p>
<p>You start to notice maybe they&rsquo;re effective</p>
<p>at building a network, and then you start making,</p>
<p>building a relationship to where at some point</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a job, they&rsquo;re working for you.</p>
<p>Or do you literally create a person like that?</p>
<p>Yeah, so intelligence organizations</p>
<p>have different strategies here.</p>
<p>In the United States, we never create.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a budget cycle that allows us to create.</p>
<p>I mean, the maximum budget cycle</p>
<p>in the United States is five years.</p>
<p>So even if we were to try to invest in some seed operation</p>
<p>or create some character of influence,</p>
<p>essentially every year you have to justify</p>
<p>why you&rsquo;re spending budget.</p>
<p>And that becomes very difficult in a democracy like ours.</p>
<p>However, Russia and China are extremely adept</p>
<p>at seed operations, longterm operations.</p>
<p>They are willing to invest and develop</p>
<p>and create an agent that serves their purposes.</p>
<p>Now, to create someone from scratch like Jeffrey Epstein,</p>
<p>the probabilities are extremely low.</p>
<p>They would have had to start</p>
<p>with like a thousand different targets</p>
<p>and try to grow a thousand different,</p>
<p>if you will, influencers, and then hope</p>
<p>that one of them hits,</p>
<p>kind of like a venture capital firm, right?</p>
<p>Invest in many, hope that a few hits.</p>
<p>More likely, they observed him at some point</p>
<p>in his own natural rise.</p>
<p>They identified his personal vulnerability,</p>
<p>very classic espionage technique.</p>
<p>And then they stepped in, introduced themselves mid career</p>
<p>and said, hey, we know you have this thing that you like</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t really frowned upon by your own people,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t frown upon it.</p>
<p>And we can help you both succeed</p>
<p>and have an endless supply of ladies along the way.</p>
<p>I recently talked to Ryan Graves, who&rsquo;s a lieutenant.</p>
<p>Ryan Graves, who&rsquo;s a fighter jet pilot,</p>
<p>about many things.</p>
<p>He also does work on autonomous weapon systems,</p>
<p>drones, and that kind of thing,</p>
<p>including quantum computing.</p>
<p>But he also happens to be one of the very few pilots</p>
<p>that were willing to go on record</p>
<p>and talk about UFO sightings.</p>
<p>Does the CIA and the federal government</p>
<p>have interest in UFOs?</p>
<p>In my experience at CIA, that is,</p>
<p>an area that remains very compartmented.</p>
<p>And that could be one of two reasons.</p>
<p>It could be because there is significant interest</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so heavily compartmented.</p>
<p>Or it could be because it&rsquo;s an area that&rsquo;s non,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just not important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a distraction.</p>
<p>So they compartment it so it doesn&rsquo;t distract</p>
<p>from other operations.</p>
<p>One of the areas that I&rsquo;ve been quite interested in</p>
<p>and where I&rsquo;ve done a lot of research and I&rsquo;ve done some work</p>
<p>in the private intelligence and private investigation side</p>
<p>is with UFOs.</p>
<p>The place where UFOs really connect</p>
<p>with the federal government is when it comes</p>
<p>to aviation safety and predominance of power.</p>
<p>So FAA and the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. military</p>
<p>are very invested in knowing what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in the skies above the United States.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s of primary interest to them.</p>
<p>When they can rule out the direct threat to national security</p>
<p>of UFOs, then they become less interested.</p>
<p>That said, when you have unexplained aerial phenomenon</p>
<p>that are unexplained, that can&rsquo;t directly be tied</p>
<p>to anything that is known of the terrestrial world,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re left without an answer to their question.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a threat or not a threat.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s a very important question.</p>
<p>But I think the scarier concern</p>
<p>for the U.S. national government</p>
<p>or for the U.S. federal government,</p>
<p>the scarier concern that nobody talks about</p>
<p>is what if the UFO isn&rsquo;t alien?</p>
<p>What if it is actually a cutting edge war machine</p>
<p>that we are eons behind ever being able to replicate?</p>
<p>Or the other concern is that it&rsquo;s a system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a machine from a foreign power</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s doing intelligence collection.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Not just military purposes, it&rsquo;s actually collecting data.</p>
<p>Well, they fall, a lot of times the federal government</p>
<p>will see the two as the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hostile tool from a foreign government.</p>
<p>So collection of information is a hostile act.</p>
<p>Absolutely, that&rsquo;s why the Espionage Act exists.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a criminal offense</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re committing espionage in the United States</p>
<p>as a U.S. citizen or a foreign citizen.</p>
<p>So I guess they keep digging</p>
<p>until they can confirm it&rsquo;s not a threat.</p>
<p>But it just, and you&rsquo;re saying that there&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>from your understanding, much evidence that they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So it could be because they&rsquo;re compartmentalized.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying private intelligence institutions</p>
<p>are trying to make progress on this.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s really difficult to know the scale.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s an economic interest</p>
<p>in the private intelligence world.</p>
<p>Because, for example, if you understand</p>
<p>why certain aerial phenomenon are happening over a location,</p>
<p>then you can use that to inform investors,</p>
<p>whether to invest in that location</p>
<p>or avoid investment in that location.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not a national security concern.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t matter to the federal government.</p>
<p>Could these UFOs be aliens?</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m going into a territory of you as a human being</p>
<p>wondering about all the alien civilizations</p>
<p>that are out there.</p>
<p>The humbling question.</p>
<p>We are not alone.</p>
<p>You think we&rsquo;re not alone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an improbability that we are alone.</p>
<p>If by virtue of the fact that sentient human life exists,</p>
<p>intelligent human life exists,</p>
<p>all the probabilities that would have to be destroyed</p>
<p>for that to be true simply speak over the galaxies</p>
<p>that exist that there&rsquo;s no possible way we&rsquo;re alone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mathematical equation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a one or a zero, right?</p>
<p>And for me, it has to exist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible otherwise rationally for me to think</p>
<p>that we are truly the only intelligent life form</p>
<p>in all of the universe.</p>
<p>But to think that an alien life form</p>
<p>is anything like us at all is equally as inconceivable.</p>
<p>To think that they&rsquo;re carbon based bipedal humanoid</p>
<p>alien species that just happened to fly around</p>
<p>in metal machines and visit alien planets</p>
<p>in a way that they become observed</p>
<p>is, it&rsquo;s just silly, it&rsquo;s the world of sci fi.</p>
<p>Well, let me push.</p>
<p>Every good scientist,</p>
<p>because we always assume that they&rsquo;re superior</p>
<p>to us in intelligence.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>When any scientist carries out an experiment,</p>
<p>the whole objective of the experiment is to observe</p>
<p>without being disclosed or being discovered.</p>
<p>So why on earth would we think that the superior species</p>
<p>makes the mistake of being discovered over and over again?</p>
<p>So to push back on that idea,</p>
<p>if we were to think about us humans trying to communicate</p>
<p>with ants, first we observe for a while.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be a bunch of PhDs written,</p>
<p>a bunch of people just sort of collecting data,</p>
<p>taking notes, trying to understand about this thing</p>
<p>that you detected that seems to be a living thing,</p>
<p>which is a very difficult thing to define</p>
<p>from an alien perspective or from our perspective</p>
<p>if we find life on Mars or something like that.</p>
<p>Okay, so you observe for a while.</p>
<p>But then if you want to actually interact with it,</p>
<p>how would you interact with the ants?</p>
<p>If I were to interact with the ants,</p>
<p>I would try to infiltrate.</p>
<p>I would try to figure out what is the language</p>
<p>they use to communicate with each other.</p>
<p>I would try to operate at their physical scale,</p>
<p>like in terms of the physics of their interaction,</p>
<p>in terms of the information, methods, mediums</p>
<p>of information exchange with pheromones or whatever,</p>
<p>however the heck, ants.</p>
<p>So I would try to mimic them in some way.</p>
<p>So in that sense, it makes sense</p>
<p>that the objects we would see, you mentioned bipedal.</p>
<p>Yes, of course it&rsquo;s ridiculous that aliens</p>
<p>would actually be very similar to us,</p>
<p>but maybe they create forms in order to be like,</p>
<p>here, the humans will understand it.</p>
<p>And this needs to be sufficiently different from humans</p>
<p>to know that there&rsquo;s something weird.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I think it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>an incredibly difficult problem of figuring out</p>
<p>how to communicate with a thing way dumber than you.</p>
<p>People assume if you&rsquo;re smart,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easier to talk to the dumb thing.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s actually extremely difficult</p>
<p>when the gap in intelligence is just orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>And so of course you can observe,</p>
<p>but once you notice the thing is sufficiently interesting,</p>
<p>how do you communicate with that thing?</p>
<p>So this is where, one of the things</p>
<p>I always try to highlight is how conspiracies are born.</p>
<p>Because many people don&rsquo;t understand how easy it is</p>
<p>to fall into the conspiratorial cycle.</p>
<p>So the first step to a conspiracy being born</p>
<p>is to have a piece of evidence that is true.</p>
<p>And then immediately following the true evidence</p>
<p>is a gap in information.</p>
<p>And then to fill in the gap of information,</p>
<p>people create an idea and then the next logical outcome</p>
<p>is based on the idea that they just created,</p>
<p>which is an idea that&rsquo;s based on something</p>
<p>that was imagined in the first place.</p>
<p>So the idea, the factual thing is now two steps away</p>
<p>and then three steps away, four steps away</p>
<p>as the things go on.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden you have this kernel of truth</p>
<p>that turned into this wild conspiracy.</p>
<p>So in our example, you talked about humans</p>
<p>trying to communicate with ants.</p>
<p>Ants are not intelligent.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, ants are not intelligent species.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a drone species that&rsquo;s somehow commanded</p>
<p>through whatever technology, whatever.</p>
<p>Spoken like a typical human, but yes.</p>
<p>Whatever biological thing is in the queen, right?</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not, it&rsquo;s not a fair equivalent.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s look at gorillas</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s look at something in the monkey family, right?</p>
<p>Where largely we agree that there is some sort</p>
<p>of intelligence there or dolphins,</p>
<p>some sort of intelligence, right?</p>
<p>It is a human thing, a human thing to want to observe</p>
<p>and then communicate and integrate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a human thing, not an intelligent life thing.</p>
<p>So for us to even think that a foreign</p>
<p>and intelligent alien species would want to engage</p>
<p>and communicate at all is an extremely human assumption.</p>
<p>And then from that assumption,</p>
<p>then we started going into all the other things you said.</p>
<p>If they wanted to communicate,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t they want to mimic?</p>
<p>If they wanted to mimic,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t they create devices like ours?</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re three steps removed from the true fact</p>
<p>of there&rsquo;s something unexplainable in the skies.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the fact is there&rsquo;s something unexplainable</p>
<p>in the skies and then we&rsquo;re filling in the gaps</p>
<p>with all our basic human biases and assumptions.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But the thing is.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re getting right back to Project Northwood.</p>
<p>We need some plan.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care how crazy the idea is, guys.</p>
<p>Give me some plan.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where we come up with.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s an alien species trying to communicate</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s an alien, a hostile threat</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trying to take over the world or who knows what.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But you have to somehow construct hypotheses</p>
<p>and theories for anomalies.</p>
<p>And then from that, amidst giant pile of the ridiculous,</p>
<p>emerges perhaps a deeper truth over a period of decades.</p>
<p>And at first, that truth is ridiculed</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s accepted, that whole process.</p>
<p>The Earth revolving around the sun?</p>
<p>Yeah, the Earth revolving around the sun.</p>
<p>But to me, it&rsquo;s interesting because it asks us</p>
<p>looking out there with SETI, just looking for alien life,</p>
<p>is forcing us to really ask questions about ourselves,</p>
<p>about what is life, how special.</p>
<p>First of all, what is intelligence?</p>
<p>How special is intelligence in the cosmos?</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s inspiring and challenging</p>
<p>to us as human beings,</p>
<p>both on a scientific and engineering level,</p>
<p>but also on a philosophical level.</p>
<p>I mean, all of those questions that are laid before us</p>
<p>when you start to think about alien life.</p>
<p>So you interviewed Joe Rogan recently.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And he said something that I thought was really,</p>
<p>really brilliant during the podcast interview.</p>
<p>He said that you.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna love hearing that.</p>
<p>But go ahead, sorry.</p>
<p>But he said that he realized at some point</p>
<p>that the turn in his opinion about UFOs happened</p>
<p>when he realized how desperately he wanted it to be true.</p>
<p>This is the human condition.</p>
<p>We are pink matter works the same way</p>
<p>as everybody&rsquo;s pink matter.</p>
<p>And one of the ways that our pink matter works</p>
<p>is with this thing, with what&rsquo;s known as a cognitive bias.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mental shortcut.</p>
<p>Essentially, your brain doesn&rsquo;t want to process</p>
<p>through facts over and over again.</p>
<p>Instead, it wants to assume certain facts are in place</p>
<p>and just jump right to the conclusion.</p>
<p>It saves energy, it saves megabytes.</p>
<p>So what Joe or Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>I feel weird calling him Joe, I don&rsquo;t know him,</p>
<p>but what Joe identified on his own.</p>
<p>Mr. Rogan.</p>
<p>What Mr. Rogan identified on his own.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Was his own cognitive loop.</p>
<p>And then he immediately grew suspicious of that loop.</p>
<p>That is a super powerful tool.</p>
<p>That is something that most people</p>
<p>never become self actualized enough to realize</p>
<p>that they have a cognitive loop,</p>
<p>let alone questioning their own cognitive loop.</p>
<p>So that was, when it came to this topic specifically,</p>
<p>that was just something that I thought was really powerful</p>
<p>because you learn to not trust your own mind.</p>
<p>Just for the record, after he drinks one whiskey,</p>
<p>all that goes out.</p>
<p>I think that was just in that moment in time, like, you know.</p>
<p>A moment of brilliance.</p>
<p>A moment of brilliance is, I think he still is, you know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s definitely, one of the things that inspires me about Joe</p>
<p>is how open minded he is, how curious he is.</p>
<p>He refuses to let sort of the conformity</p>
<p>and the conventions of any one community,</p>
<p>including the scientific community,</p>
<p>be a kind of thing that limits his curiosity,</p>
<p>of asking what if, like the whole, it&rsquo;s entirely possible.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>And it actually represents what the best of science is,</p>
<p>that childlike curiosity.</p>
<p>But, so it&rsquo;s good to sort of balance those two things,</p>
<p>but then you have to wake up to it, like,</p>
<p>is this, is there a chance this is true,</p>
<p>or do I just really want it to be true?</p>
<p>And that.</p>
<p>Like that hot girl that talks to you overseas?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>For a brief moment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a deeper explanation for it</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll tell you off the mic that perhaps</p>
<p>a lot of people can kind of figure out.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Just to take it one step further,</p>
<p>cause I love this stuff.</p>
<p>Personally, I love pink matter stuff.</p>
<p>In your interview with Jack Barsky,</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s a good friend of mine, a good dude.</p>
<p>An incredible person.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In your conversation with Jack Barsky,</p>
<p>you guys, he started talking to you about</p>
<p>how his recruiters were feeding back to him his own beliefs,</p>
<p>his own opinions about himself, how smart he was,</p>
<p>how good he was, how uniquely qualified he was.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all pink matter manipulation.</p>
<p>Feeding right back to the person</p>
<p>what they already think of themselves</p>
<p>is a way to get them to invest and trust you faster</p>
<p>because obviously you value them for all the right reasons</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how they see themselves.</p>
<p>So that loop that the KGB was using with Jack,</p>
<p>Jack did not wake up to that loop at the time.</p>
<p>He woke up to it later.</p>
<p>So it happens to all of us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all in a loop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just whether it&rsquo;s about oat milk</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s about aliens</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s about the Democrats trying to take your guns,</p>
<p>whatever it is, everybody&rsquo;s in a loop</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve got to wake up to ask ourselves,</p>
<p>just like you said, is it true</p>
<p>or do we just really want it to be true?</p>
<p>And until you ask yourself that question,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just one of the masses trapped in the loop.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the really, the Nietzsche gaze into the abyss.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dangerous thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the path to insanity is to ask that question.</p>
<p>You want to be doing it carefully,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also the place where you can truly discover</p>
<p>something fundamental about this world</p>
<p>that people don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>and then that and lay the groundwork for progress,</p>
<p>scientific, cultural, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>What is one spy trick?</p>
<p>This is from a Reddit that I really enjoy.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s one spy trick and you&rsquo;re full of a million spy tricks.</p>
<p>People should follow you.</p>
<p>You did an amazing podcast.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just an amazing person.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>What is the one spy trick you would teach everyone</p>
<p>that they can use to improve their life instantly?</p>
<p>Now you already mentioned quite a few,</p>
<p>but what else could jump to mind?</p>
<p>My go to answer for this has not really changed much</p>
<p>over the last few years.</p>
<p>So the first, the most important spy trick</p>
<p>to change everything immediately</p>
<p>is something called perception versus perspective.</p>
<p>We all look at the world through our own perception.</p>
<p>My dad used to tell me,</p>
<p>my stepdad used to tell me that perception is reality.</p>
<p>And I was arguing this with him when I was 14 years old.</p>
<p>I told you so dad, you&rsquo;re still wrong.</p>
<p>But perception is your interpretation</p>
<p>of the world around you, but it&rsquo;s unique only to you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no advantage in your perception.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why so many people find themselves</p>
<p>arguing all the time,</p>
<p>trying to convince other people of their own perception.</p>
<p>The way that you win any argument,</p>
<p>the way that you get ahead in your career,</p>
<p>the way that you outsell or out race anybody</p>
<p>is when you move off of perception</p>
<p>and move into perspective.</p>
<p>Perspective is the act or the art</p>
<p>of observing the world from outside of yourself,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s outside of yourself as like an entity,</p>
<p>just observing in a third from a different point of view,</p>
<p>or even more powerful, you sit in the shoes,</p>
<p>you sit in the seat of the person opposite you.</p>
<p>And you think to yourself, what is their life like?</p>
<p>What do they feel right now?</p>
<p>Are they comfortable?</p>
<p>Are they uncomfortable?</p>
<p>Are they afraid?</p>
<p>Are they scared?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the stressor that they woke up to this morning?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the stressor that they&rsquo;re gonna go to sleep</p>
<p>with tonight?</p>
<p>When you shift places and get out of your own perception</p>
<p>and into someone else&rsquo;s perspective,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re thinking like them,</p>
<p>which is giving you an informational advantage.</p>
<p>But you know what they&rsquo;re all doing?</p>
<p>Everyone else out there is trapped in their own perception,</p>
<p>not thinking about a different perspective.</p>
<p>So immediately you have superior information,</p>
<p>superior positioning,</p>
<p>you have an advantage that they don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>And if you do that to your boss,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna change your career.</p>
<p>If you do that to your spouse,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna change your marriage.</p>
<p>If you do that to your kids,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna change your family legacy</p>
<p>because nobody else out there is doing it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting how difficult empathy is for people</p>
<p>and how powerful it is,</p>
<p>especially for, like you said,</p>
<p>with spouse, like intimacy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like stepping outside of yourself</p>
<p>and really putting yourself in the shoes of the other person</p>
<p>considering how they see the world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I really enjoy that</p>
<p>because how does that exactly lead to connection?</p>
<p>I think when you start to understand</p>
<p>the way the other person sees the world,</p>
<p>you start to enjoy the world through their eyes</p>
<p>and you start to be able to share,</p>
<p>in terms of intimacy,</p>
<p>share the beauty that they see together</p>
<p>because you understand their perspective.</p>
<p>And somehow you converge as well.</p>
<p>Of course, that allows you to gather information better</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And that allows you to work together better,</p>
<p>to share in all different kinds of ways.</p>
<p>But for intimacy, that&rsquo;s a really powerful thing.</p>
<p>And also for, actually,</p>
<p>like people you really disagree with</p>
<p>or people on the internet you disagree with and so on,</p>
<p>I find empathy is such a powerful way</p>
<p>to resolve any tensions there.</p>
<p>Even like people like trolls or all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t deride them.</p>
<p>I just kind of put myself in their shoes</p>
<p>and it becomes like an enjoyable comradery with that person.</p>
<p>So I wanna draw a pretty hard line</p>
<p>between perspective and empathy.</p>
<p>Because empathy is, frankly, an overused term</p>
<p>by people who don&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re saying sometimes.</p>
<p>I think you know what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>but the vast majority of people listening.</p>
<p>I would argue that, but that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>As soon as you say empathy,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna just be like,</p>
<p>oh, yeah, I&rsquo;ve heard this a thousand times.</p>
<p>Empathy is about feeling what other people feel.</p>
<p>Or understanding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more about feeling, would you say?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s about feelings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about understanding someone else&rsquo;s feelings.</p>
<p>Feeling, it&rsquo;s not the same as sympathy</p>
<p>where you feel their feelings.</p>
<p>Empathy is about recognizing that they have feelings</p>
<p>and recognizing that their feelings are valid.</p>
<p>Perspective is more than just feelings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the pink matter on the left side</p>
<p>and the right side of the brain.</p>
<p>Yes, I care about feelings,</p>
<p>and this goes directly to your point about connection.</p>
<p>Yes, I care about feelings,</p>
<p>but I also care about objectives.</p>
<p>What is your life, what is your aspirational goal?</p>
<p>What was it like to grow up as you?</p>
<p>What was it like to experience this</p>
<p>and how did this shape your opinion on that?</p>
<p>And what is it that you&rsquo;re going to do next?</p>
<p>More than just feelings, actual tactical actions.</p>
<p>And that becomes extremely valuable</p>
<p>in the operational world</p>
<p>because if you can get into someone&rsquo;s head,</p>
<p>left brain and right brain, feelings and logic,</p>
<p>you can start anticipating</p>
<p>what actions they&rsquo;re gonna take next.</p>
<p>You can direct the actions that they&rsquo;re going to take next</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re basically telling them the story</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in their own head.</p>
<p>When it comes to relationships and personal connection,</p>
<p>we talked about it earlier,</p>
<p>the thing that people want the most is community.</p>
<p>They want someone else who understands them.</p>
<p>They want to be with people.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to be alone.</p>
<p>The more you practice perspective, empathy or no empathy,</p>
<p>the more you just validate that a person is there.</p>
<p>I am in this time and space with you in this moment.</p>
<p>Feelings aside, that is powerful.</p>
<p>That is intimate.</p>
<p>And whether you&rsquo;re talking about lovers</p>
<p>or whether you&rsquo;re talking about a business exchange</p>
<p>or whether you&rsquo;re talking about collaborators in a crime,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here with you ride or die, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s powerful.</p>
<p>How much of what you&rsquo;ve learned in your role at the CIA</p>
<p>transfer over to relationships,</p>
<p>the business relationship to other aspects of life?</p>
<p>This is something you work closely with powerful people</p>
<p>to help them out.</p>
<p>What have you learned about the commonalities,</p>
<p>about the problems that people face?</p>
<p>Man, I would say about a solid 95% of what I learned</p>
<p>at CIA carries over to the civilian world.</p>
<p>That 5% that doesn&rsquo;t is,</p>
<p>it would carry over in a disaster, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s knowing how to shoot on target</p>
<p>with my non dominant hand really only has one purpose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna happen day to day, right?</p>
<p>Knowing how to do a dead drop that isn&rsquo;t discoverable</p>
<p>by the local police force isn&rsquo;t gonna be useful right now,</p>
<p>but it could be useful in disaster.</p>
<p>But the 95% of stuff that&rsquo;s useful,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all tied to the human condition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all tied to being able to</p>
<p>understand what someone&rsquo;s thinking,</p>
<p>understand what someone&rsquo;s feeling,</p>
<p>direct their thoughts, direct their emotions,</p>
<p>direct their thought process, win their attention,</p>
<p>win their loyalty, win influence with them,</p>
<p>grow your network, grow your own circle of influence.</p>
<p>I mean, all of that is immensely, immensely valuable.</p>
<p>As an example, the disguise,</p>
<p>the disguise thing that we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>disguise in and of itself has mixed utility.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re Brad Pitt and you don&rsquo;t want anybody</p>
<p>to know you&rsquo;re Brad Pitt, you put on a level one disguise</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Or maybe you call me and I walk you through</p>
<p>a level two disguise so that you can go to Aruba</p>
<p>and nobody&rsquo;s gonna know you&rsquo;re in Aruba, right?</p>
<p>Whatever it is.</p>
<p>But even there with the 5%</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t apply to everyday life,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still elements that do.</p>
<p>For example, when a person looks at a human being&rsquo;s face,</p>
<p>the first place they look is the same part of the face</p>
<p>as if they were reading a piece of paper.</p>
<p>So in English, we start from the top left</p>
<p>and we read left to right, top to bottom.</p>
<p>So when an English speaking person</p>
<p>interacts with another person,</p>
<p>the first thing they look at isn&rsquo;t their eyes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the upper left from their point of view,</p>
<p>corner of their face, right?</p>
<p>They look there and the information they get</p>
<p>is hair color, hair pattern, skin color, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Before they know anything else about the face.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why somebody can look at you</p>
<p>and then you ask them, what color are my eyes?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really remember.</p>
<p>Because the way they read the face,</p>
<p>they read it from left to right, top to bottom.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re paying a lot of attention</p>
<p>to the first few things they see</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re paying less attention</p>
<p>as they go down the face.</p>
<p>The same scrolling behavior that you see</p>
<p>on the internet, right?</p>
<p>So when you understand that through the lens of disguise,</p>
<p>it allows you to make a very powerful disguise.</p>
<p>The most important part of your disguise</p>
<p>is here if you&rsquo;re English speaking, right?</p>
<p>Here if you&rsquo;re speaking some foreign languages</p>
<p>that read right to left, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re, if it&rsquo;s Chinese,</p>
<p>you know that they&rsquo;re gonna look from here down</p>
<p>because they read left down.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>So interesting.</p>
<p>So yeah, knowing that really helps you</p>
<p>sort of configure the things</p>
<p>in terms of physical appearance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Correct, correct.</p>
<p>So when it comes to how to make a disguise,</p>
<p>not so useful to the ultra wealthy usually.</p>
<p>But when it comes to how to read a face</p>
<p>or more importantly, how people are going to read your face,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s extremely important because now you know</p>
<p>where to find the first signs of deception</p>
<p>in a baseline or anything else.</p>
<p>You mentioned that the idea of having privacy</p>
<p>is one that we kind of, we think we can,</p>
<p>but we really don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Is it possible for maybe somebody like me</p>
<p>or a regular person to disappear from the grid?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s not as hard as you might think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not convenient.</p>
<p>Again, convenience and security.</p>
<p>You can disappear tomorrow, right?</p>
<p>I can walk you through three steps right now</p>
<p>that are gonna help you disappear tomorrow,</p>
<p>but none of them are convenient.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all extremely secure, right?</p>
<p>The first thing you do is every piece</p>
<p>of digital technology you have</p>
<p>that is connected to you in any way is now dead.</p>
<p>You just let the battery run out.</p>
<p>Forever.</p>
<p>You never touch it again, starting at this moment.</p>
<p>What you have to do is go out and acquire a new one.</p>
<p>Realistically, you will not be able to acquire a new one</p>
<p>in the United States by buying it</p>
<p>because to do so, you would tie it to your credit card.</p>
<p>You would tie it to a location, a time, a place,</p>
<p>a registered name, whatever else.</p>
<p>So you would have to acquire it essentially by theft</p>
<p>or through the black market.</p>
<p>So you would want something</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re gonna need the advantage of technology</p>
<p>without it being in your name.</p>
<p>So you go out and you steal a phone or you steal a laptop.</p>
<p>You do whatever you have to do to make sure</p>
<p>that you can get on with the password</p>
<p>and whatever else that might be.</p>
<p>As dirty or as clean as you want that to be,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all morally flexible here,</p>
<p>but now you have a technological device</p>
<p>that you can work with.</p>
<p>And then from there on,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just doing whatever you have to do,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re stealing every step of the way</p>
<p>or whether you run a massive con.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that we often talk about con men and cons.</p>
<p>Do you know what the root,</p>
<p>the word that con is a root word for?</p>
<p>Confidence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what a con man is.</p>
<p>A con man is a confidence man.</p>
<p>Just somebody who is so brazenly confident</p>
<p>that the people around them</p>
<p>living in their own perception, not perspective,</p>
<p>and their perception, they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>well, this guy really knows what he&rsquo;s talking about,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m gonna do what he says.</p>
<p>So you can run a massive con</p>
<p>and that can take care of your finances,</p>
<p>that can take care of your lodging,</p>
<p>whatever else it is.</p>
<p>You are whoever you present yourself to be.</p>
<p>So if you wanna go be Bill for the afternoon,</p>
<p>just go tell people your name is Bill.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna question you.</p>
<p>So the intelligence,</p>
<p>the natural web of intelligence gathering systems</p>
<p>we have in the United States and in the world,</p>
<p>are they going to believe for long that you&rsquo;re Bill?</p>
<p>Are they?</p>
<p>Until you do something that makes them think otherwise.</p>
<p>If you are consistent,</p>
<p>we talked about consistency being the superpower.</p>
<p>If you are consistent, they will think you&rsquo;re Bill forever.</p>
<p>How difficult is that to do?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not convenient.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite difficult.</p>
<p>Does that require training?</p>
<p>It does require training.</p>
<p>Because why do criminals always get caught?</p>
<p>Because they stop being consistent.</p>
<p>Criminals, I&rsquo;ve&hellip;</p>
<p>I never hesitate to admit this,</p>
<p>but people tell me I should hesitate to admit it.</p>
<p>So now I hesitate because of the guidance</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten to hesitate, right?</p>
<p>I like criminals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m friends with a number of criminals</p>
<p>because the only people who get me,</p>
<p>like right away who get me, are criminals.</p>
<p>Because we know what it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>to basically abandon all the rules,</p>
<p>do our own thing our own way,</p>
<p>and watch the world just keep turning.</p>
<p>Most people are so stuck in the trap</p>
<p>of normal thought and behavior</p>
<p>that when I tell them, they just don&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>Just go tell people your name is Bill.</p>
<p>Most people are going to say,</p>
<p>psh, that&rsquo;s not going to work.</p>
<p>But a criminal will be like, oh yeah, I did that once.</p>
<p>I just told everybody my name is Nancy,</p>
<p>you know, dude, and they still believe me.</p>
<p>Criminals just get it, right?</p>
<p>So what happens with criminals</p>
<p>is they go to the school of hard knocks.</p>
<p>They go to&hellip;</p>
<p>They learn criminal behavior on the job.</p>
<p>Spies go to school.</p>
<p>We go to the best spy school in the world.</p>
<p>We go to Langley&rsquo;s, the farm, right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s known as Field Tradecraft Course, FTC,</p>
<p>in a covert location for a covert period of time</p>
<p>and covert, covert, covert.</p>
<p>So if anybody from CIA is watching,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not breaking any rules.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all on Wikipedia, but it&rsquo;s not coming from me.</p>
<p>But we do&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we do it.</p>
<p>They train us from a hundred years of experience</p>
<p>and the best ways to carry out covert operations,</p>
<p>which are all just criminal activities overseas.</p>
<p>We learn how to do it the right way</p>
<p>so that we don&rsquo;t get caught.</p>
<p>We learn how to be consistent.</p>
<p>More importantly, we learn how to create an operation</p>
<p>that has a limited lifespan</p>
<p>because the longer it lives, the more at risk you are.</p>
<p>So you want operations to be short, concise,</p>
<p>on the X, off the X.</p>
<p>Limit your room for mistakes.</p>
<p>Criminals want the default</p>
<p>to wanting these longterm operations</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t want to have to recreate a new way</p>
<p>to make money every 15 days.</p>
<p>You mentioned, if anybody from the CIA is watching,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ve seen you talk about the fact</p>
<p>that sort of people that are currently working at the CIA</p>
<p>would kind of look down on the people who&rsquo;ve left the CIA</p>
<p>and they divide them, especially if you go public,</p>
<p>especially if there&rsquo;s a book and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Do you feel the pressure of that to be quiet,</p>
<p>to not do something like this conversation</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re doing today?</p>
<p>I feel the silent judgment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very real.</p>
<p>I feel it for myself and I feel it for my wife</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t appear on camera very often,</p>
<p>but who&rsquo;s also former CIA.</p>
<p>We both feel the judgment.</p>
<p>We know that right now, three days after this is released,</p>
<p>somebody&rsquo;s gonna send an email on a closed network system</p>
<p>inside CIA headquarters and there&rsquo;s a bunch of people</p>
<p>who are gonna laugh at it,</p>
<p>a bunch of people who are gonna say that who knows what.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna be good stuff.</p>
<p>A bunch of people you respect probably.</p>
<p>A bunch of people who I&rsquo;m trying to bring honor to.</p>
<p>Whether I know them or respect them is irrelevant.</p>
<p>These are people who are out there doing the deed every day</p>
<p>and I wanna bring them honor and I wanna do that in a way</p>
<p>that I get to share what they can&rsquo;t share</p>
<p>and what they won&rsquo;t share when they leave</p>
<p>because they will also feel the silent pressure,</p>
<p>the pressure to the shame, the judgment, right?</p>
<p>But the truth is that I&rsquo;ve done this now long enough.</p>
<p>The first few times that I spoke out publicly,</p>
<p>the response to being a positive voice</p>
<p>for what the sacrifice is that people are making,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so refreshing to be an honest voice</p>
<p>that people don&rsquo;t normally hear that it&rsquo;s too important.</p>
<p>One day I&rsquo;m gonna be gone</p>
<p>and my kids are gonna look back on all this</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna see their dad</p>
<p>trying to do the right thing for the right reasons</p>
<p>and even if my son or daughter ends up at CIA</p>
<p>and even if they get ridiculed for being,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;re the Bustamante kid, right?</p>
<p>Your dad&rsquo;s a total sellout, whatever it might be.</p>
<p>Like I want them to know dad was doing what he could</p>
<p>to bring honor to the organization</p>
<p>even when he couldn&rsquo;t stay in the organization anymore.</p>
<p>So you said when you were 27,</p>
<p>I think you didn&rsquo;t know what the hell you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So now that you&rsquo;re a few years older and wiser,</p>
<p>let me ask you to put on your wise sage hat</p>
<p>and give advice to other 27 year olds</p>
<p>or even younger 17, 18 year olds</p>
<p>that are just out of high school, maybe going to college,</p>
<p>trying to figure out this life,</p>
<p>this career thing that they&rsquo;re on.</p>
<p>What advice would you give them</p>
<p>about how to have a career</p>
<p>or how to have a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a powerful question, man?</p>
<p>Have you figured it out yet yourself?</p>
<p>No, I think I&rsquo;m a grand total of seven days smarter</p>
<p>than I was at 27.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a good average.</p>
<p>Progress.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still time.</p>
<p>So for all the young people out there deciding what to do,</p>
<p>I would just say the same thing that I do say</p>
<p>and I will say to my own kids.</p>
<p>You only have one life.</p>
<p>You only have one chance.</p>
<p>If you spend it doing what other people expect you to do,</p>
<p>you will wake up to your regret at some point.</p>
<p>I woke up when I was 38 years old.</p>
<p>My wife in many ways is still waking up to it</p>
<p>as she watches her grandparents pass</p>
<p>and an older generation pass away.</p>
<p>The folks that really have a blessed life</p>
<p>are the people who learn early on</p>
<p>to live with their own rules, live their own way</p>
<p>and live every day as if it&rsquo;s the last day.</p>
<p>Not necessarily to waste it by being wasteful or silly,</p>
<p>but to recognize that today is a day</p>
<p>to be productive and constructive for yourself.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want a career,</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s not the day to start pursuing a career</p>
<p>just because someone else told you to do it.</p>
<p>If you wanna learn a language,</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s a day to find a way to buy a ticket</p>
<p>to another country and learn through immersion.</p>
<p>If you want a date, if you wanna get married,</p>
<p>if you want a business,</p>
<p>today is the day to just go out</p>
<p>and take one step in that direction.</p>
<p>And as long as you, every day you just make one new step,</p>
<p>just like CIA recruited me, just do the next thing.</p>
<p>If the step seems like it&rsquo;s too big,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s probably two other steps</p>
<p>that you can do before that.</p>
<p>Just make constant progress, build momentum,</p>
<p>move forward and live on your own terms.</p>
<p>That way you don&rsquo;t ever wake up to the regret.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll be over before you know it.</p>
<p>Whether you regret it or not, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Self respect, that&rsquo;s a fast answer.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a story behind it if you want the story.</p>
<p>I would love to have the story.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a covert training base in Alabama in the south,</p>
<p>far south and like the armpit of America</p>
<p>where elite tier one operators</p>
<p>go to learn human intelligence stuff.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a bar inside this base.</p>
<p>And on the wall is just, it&rsquo;s scribbles of opinions.</p>
<p>And the question in the middle of the wall</p>
<p>says what&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>And all these elite operators over the last 25 or 30 years,</p>
<p>they all go, they get drunk and they scribble their answer</p>
<p>and they circle it with a Sharpie, right?</p>
<p>Love, family, America, freedom, right, whatever.</p>
<p>And then the only thing they have to do</p>
<p>is if they&rsquo;re gonna write something on there,</p>
<p>they have to connect it with something else on the wall,</p>
<p>at least one other thing.</p>
<p>So if they write love, they can&rsquo;t just leave it</p>
<p>floating there, they have to write love in a little bubble</p>
<p>and connect it to something else, connect it to family,</p>
<p>whatever else.</p>
<p>When you look at that wall,</p>
<p>the word self respect is on the wall</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s got a circle around it.</p>
<p>And then you can&rsquo;t see any other word</p>
<p>because of all the things that connect to self respect.</p>
<p>Just dozens of people have written over,</p>
<p>have written their words down and been drawn</p>
<p>and scribbled over because of all the lines</p>
<p>that connect to self respect.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>From my point of view,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen a better answer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all self respect.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t respect yourself, how can you do anything else?</p>
<p>How can you love someone else</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have self respect?</p>
<p>How can you build a business you&rsquo;re proud of</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have self respect?</p>
<p>How can you raise kids?</p>
<p>How can you make a difference?</p>
<p>How can you pioneer anything?</p>
<p>How can you just wake up and have a good day</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have self respect?</p>
<p>The power of the individual,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what makes this country great.</p>
<p>I have to say, after I was born,</p>
<p>I have to say after traveling quite a bit in Europe</p>
<p>and especially in a place of war,</p>
<p>coming back to the United States</p>
<p>makes me really appreciate</p>
<p>about the better angels of this nation,</p>
<p>the ideals it stands for, the values it stands for.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to thank you for serving this nation for time</p>
<p>and humanity for time</p>
<p>and for being brave enough and bold enough</p>
<p>to still talk about it and to inspire others,</p>
<p>to educate others for having many amazing conversations</p>
<p>and for honoring me by having this conversation today.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an amazing human.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for talking today.</p>
<p>Lex, I appreciate the invite, man.</p>
<p>It was a joy.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Andrew Bustamante.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Sun Tzu in The Art of War.</p>
<p>Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night.</p>
<p>And when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
