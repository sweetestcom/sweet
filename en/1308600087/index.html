    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Recently, I had the pleasure of hosting two live events,</p>
<p>one in Seattle, Washington, and one in Portland, Oregon,</p>
<p>both entitled The Brain-Body Contract,</p>
<p>where I discussed science and science-related tools</p>
<p>for mental health, physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>My favorite part of each evening, however,</p>
<p>was the question-and-answer period</p>
<p>that followed the lecture.</p>
<p>I love the question-and-answer period</p>
<p>because it gives me an opportunity</p>
<p>to hear directly from the audience</p>
<p>as to what they want to know most,</p>
<p>and indeed, to get into a bit of dialogue</p>
<p>so we really clarify what are the underlying mechanisms</p>
<p>of particular tools, how best to use the tools</p>
<p>for things like focus and sleep.</p>
<p>We also touched on some things</p>
<p>related to mental health and physical health.</p>
<p>It was a delight for me,</p>
<p>and I like to think that the audience learned a lot.</p>
<p>I know that many of you weren&rsquo;t able to attend those events,</p>
<p>but we wanted to make the information available to you.</p>
<p>So what follows this is a recording</p>
<p>of the question-and-answer period</p>
<p>from the lecture in Seattle, Washington.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll find it to be both interesting and informative.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to thank our sponsors of these live events.</p>
<p>The first is Momentous Supplements,</p>
<p>which is our partner with the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>providing supplements that are of the very highest quality,</p>
<p>that ship international,</p>
<p>and that are arranged in dosages</p>
<p>and single-ingredient formulations</p>
<p>that make it possible for you</p>
<p>to develop the optimal supplement strategy for you.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d also like to thank our other sponsor,</p>
<p>which is InsideTracker,</p>
<p>which provides blood tests and DNA tests</p>
<p>so you can monitor your immediate</p>
<p>and long-term health progress.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to announce</p>
<p>that there are two new live events scheduled.</p>
<p>The first one is going to take place Sunday, October 16th</p>
<p>at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The other live event will take place Wednesday, November 9th</p>
<p>at the Beacon Theater in New York City.</p>
<p>Tickets to both of those events are now available online</p>
<p>at hubermanlab.com slash tour.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hubermanlab.com slash tour.</p>
<p>I do hope that you learn from and enjoy the recording</p>
<p>of the question and answer period that follows this.</p>
<p>And last, but certainly not least,</p>
<p>thank you for your interest in science.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>What is your most used protocol?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming that you mean the protocol that I use the most.</p>
<p>I genuinely do the morning sunlight viewing this evening.</p>
<p>I went and looked at the sunset every single evening,</p>
<p>and I absolutely do 10 to 30 minutes</p>
<p>of some non-sleep-deep-rest protocol every single day.</p>
<p>Every single day.</p>
<p>The reason I called it non-sleep-deep-rest</p>
<p>is because while I love the classic traditions</p>
<p>and things like yoga nidra,</p>
<p>my fear was that if I called things yoga nidra</p>
<p>that people would get spooked.</p>
<p>But I also have to say that I rather loathe</p>
<p>the fact that scientists use so many fancy terms</p>
<p>that it also vaults information</p>
<p>from the very people that fund the work.</p>
<p>So I have a kind of an ax to grind</p>
<p>with the scientific community, too.</p>
<p>So non-sleep-deep-rest was my attempt to kind of</p>
<p>put my arms around a number of different things</p>
<p>like yoga nidra, which I have great reverence for,</p>
<p>and other tools like that.</p>
<p>I do that usually in the early afternoon,</p>
<p>or if I wake up first thing in the morning</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t slept enough or not that well,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do 30 minutes of yoga nidra,</p>
<p>and I feel terrific after that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just mention a brief anecdote.</p>
<p>I learned about yoga nidra while researching a book</p>
<p>that I never wrote that may or may not ever be published.</p>
<p>I went and spent a week in a trauma center</p>
<p>and addiction treatment center in Florida</p>
<p>and saw some amazing work of some amazing people</p>
<p>and some amazing transformations,</p>
<p>and it was a big part of their daily routine</p>
<p>for these people to do yoga nidra and non-sleep-deep-rest,</p>
<p>and I thought they&rsquo;re really onto something here.</p>
<p>So almost religiously for me, every day, 10 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Not that it matters, but the CEO of Google&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really into NSDR, I don&rsquo;t know him,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s written about that a number of times.</p>
<p>In Seattle, sunrise varies from 4.30 a.m. to 9 a.m.,</p>
<p>depending on season.</p>
<p>So are you recommending to vary your wake up</p>
<p>outside time with the seasons?</p>
<p>Somewhat.</p>
<p>You know, you don&rsquo;t need to see the sun cross the horizon.</p>
<p>That would be great, but not everyone</p>
<p>can wake up with the sun.</p>
<p>You want to get so-called low solar angle sunlight.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because of that yellow-blue contrast</p>
<p>that we talked about before.</p>
<p>Many people wake up before the sun is out.</p>
<p>If that case, if you wanna be awake,</p>
<p>turn on as many bright lights as you can.</p>
<p>Up here, I don&rsquo;t know, does anyone here,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to admit this if you don&rsquo;t want to,</p>
<p>but maybe nod or raise your hand</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re comfortable with me,</p>
<p>that in the winter you feel less well,</p>
<p>or typically in the transition.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s huge up here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And then when you&rsquo;re on campus,</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ve spent time,</p>
<p>and you see Rainier, and it&rsquo;s like the blossoms are out,</p>
<p>and you feel almost high, because that&rsquo;s dopamine.</p>
<p>You know, animals that have white pellage in the winter,</p>
<p>and then it turns dark in the summer and spring months,</p>
<p>that pathway, the melanin pathway is from tyrosine,</p>
<p>which is the precursor to dopamine,</p>
<p>and also to melanin production in the fur.</p>
<p>So the whole system is linked.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not rigged, it&rsquo;s linked.</p>
<p>So what do I suggest?</p>
<p>I suggest in the winter months,</p>
<p>getting 30 minutes of sunlight viewing.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s a lot, but it&rsquo;s much better</p>
<p>than feeling lousy all day.</p>
<p>And then the real key in the winter</p>
<p>is to try and catch some sunlight before it goes down.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re indoors and it goes down,</p>
<p>and then you go outside and it&rsquo;s dark,</p>
<p>your brain and body don&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>where they are in time.</p>
<p>And then you flip on Ozark, and you&rsquo;re watching Ozark,</p>
<p>and then you really don&rsquo;t know where you are in time.</p>
<p>I have one more episode, Don&rsquo;t Tell Me What Happened,</p>
<p>that shows.</p>
<p>When I was a postdoc, I used to recommend the wire</p>
<p>to my competitors.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>I go to sleep fired up, ready and excited</p>
<p>to do whatever it takes.</p>
<p>When I wake up, that drive is depleted.</p>
<p>Why and what can I do?</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Have not heard that one before,</p>
<p>but if I were to venture a guess.</p>
<p>You know, we didn&rsquo;t spend much time tonight</p>
<p>talking about the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>this kind of seesaw that takes us from very alert,</p>
<p>potentially panicked, but to very, very deep sleep.</p>
<p>Even, you know, God forbid you go into a coma,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because the parasympathetic nervous system</p>
<p>is overactive relative to the sympathetic nervous system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a seesaw of autonomic function.</p>
<p>You may be sleeping very, very deeply,</p>
<p>and when you are in deep, deep rest,</p>
<p>the last thing you wanna do is get into</p>
<p>that forward center of mass,</p>
<p>thinking, planning, predicting, right?</p>
<p>In, you know, again, in yoga nidra,</p>
<p>again, non-sleep, deep rest,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this common theme in the script</p>
<p>of going from thinking and doing and predicting</p>
<p>to being and feeling, they say.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not making fun of them.</p>
<p>As the moment I hear that, I go,</p>
<p>just gonna be and feel.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually just moving into sensation,</p>
<p>but no planning, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing mysterious about it.</p>
<p>Sensation, but no planning.</p>
<p>Now, in sleep, a very deeply parasympathetic sleep state,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening?</p>
<p>You actually, that visual aperture is actually so big,</p>
<p>right, you&rsquo;re not in panoramic vision,</p>
<p>your eyes are actually closed.</p>
<p>Space and time are from past, present, and future</p>
<p>are invited into your thinking.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in a deep, deep state of relaxation.</p>
<p>And it may be, Dustin, that when you&rsquo;re waking up,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having a hard time transitioning out of that</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re sleeping so deeply.</p>
<p>You may be waking up mid-sleep cycle.</p>
<p>Many people find it useful to set an alarm</p>
<p>so that they wake up at the end of a 90-minute,</p>
<p>so-called ultradian cycle.</p>
<p>There are some sleep apps that do this on the phone.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t recall their names, but.</p>
<p>So rather than sleeping seven hours,</p>
<p>you might be better off sleeping six</p>
<p>or seven and a half hours, right,</p>
<p>waking up at the end of one of these 90-minute cycles.</p>
<p>Try that.</p>
<p>I would be consistent with what we know about the biology.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s common to, if you sleep very deeply,</p>
<p>to wake up and not necessarily wanna spring out of bed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard of these people</p>
<p>that just wanna spring out of bed and attack the day.</p>
<p>Jocko Willink, 4.30 in the morning, his Casio phone.</p>
<p>I have a watch, I&rsquo;m seeing his watch,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s like eight for me, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>wow, like again, these people are amazing.</p>
<p>I must be doing something wrong.</p>
<p>But these are, you know, I don&rsquo;t wake up that way,</p>
<p>you know, like Tigger.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I want water, I want sunlight.</p>
<p>90 minutes later, I want caffeine.</p>
<p>What are some of your favorite books</p>
<p>that have had the biggest impact on you?</p>
<p>Kyle, gee, thank you, Kyle.</p>
<p>Gosh, so many.</p>
<p>You know, for nonfiction,</p>
<p>well, Oliver Sacks&rsquo; autobiography, On the Move,</p>
<p>had a profound impact on me.</p>
<p>You know, people hated him.</p>
<p>The scientific community tried to kick him out.</p>
<p>They said horrible things about him,</p>
<p>created all sorts of scandals.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until Awakenings became a blockbuster movie</p>
<p>that suddenly he got appointments at NYU and Columbia.</p>
<p>Then now they wanted him back,</p>
<p>and the revered neurologist, like incredible, right?</p>
<p>But he was also a real seeker in the cuttlefish thing,</p>
<p>and he had a lot of internal struggles too,</p>
<p>some of which I relate to, some of which I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Actually, I&rsquo;ve been in touch with his former partner</p>
<p>because it actually moved to Topanga Canyon</p>
<p>for a short while just because Oliver lived there.</p>
<p>I thought, if I go there, I&rsquo;ll actually finish this book.</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>Just moving someplace doesn&rsquo;t allow you to finish a book.</p>
<p>He lived in Topanga, so I was like, that&rsquo;s the key.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And people were wondering why I was hanging</p>
<p>around their house all the time,</p>
<p>because it was Oliver&rsquo;s former home.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an amazing book.</p>
<p>And tells you my obsessive nature.</p>
<p>The other books that have had a profound influence on me,</p>
<p>I would say in the nonfiction realm,</p>
<p>well, I learned how to make a decent steak</p>
<p>and a few other simple recipes not well</p>
<p>from Tim Ferriss&rsquo; book, The Four Hour Chef,</p>
<p>because I really needed help.</p>
<p>That was a fun one.</p>
<p>I like Robert Greene&rsquo;s book, Mastery,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve had amazing mentors,</p>
<p>and that book is all about finding mentors</p>
<p>and assigning mentors to you, even if you don&rsquo;t know them.</p>
<p>And as you can tell from my stories about Oliver,</p>
<p>who I never met, and a few other folks</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve just decided that they don&rsquo;t know it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m mentoring them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re mentoring me, excuse me.</p>
<p>That book was really important for me.</p>
<p>And that mentor-mentee relationships</p>
<p>always involve a breakup, either by death</p>
<p>or by decision or by consequence,</p>
<p>your circumstance, rather.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something happens, and they&rsquo;re supposed</p>
<p>to break.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not supposed to apprentice with somebody forever.</p>
<p>That was an interesting book for me.</p>
<p>I would say in the fiction realm,</p>
<p>I would say in the fiction realm,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all childhood books,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve read fiction.</p>
<p>I read a lot of poetry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big Wendell Berry fan.</p>
<p>I like poetry because poetry, to me,</p>
<p>is like the subconscious.</p>
<p>The structure is all messed up,</p>
<p>and you think you understand what they&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t really know.</p>
<p>And so it always feels important and consequential,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s your own interpretation.</p>
<p>And then I love The Psychologist.</p>
<p>I love Jung.</p>
<p>I love Erickson.</p>
<p>I love The Psychologist and could read endlessly</p>
<p>about the early days of attachment theory</p>
<p>and things like that,</p>
<p>because I find that stuff to be fascinating.</p>
<p>So those books have been a lot of fun,</p>
<p>and I love picture books with animals.</p>
<p>And so if you can get a hold</p>
<p>of Joel Sartore&rsquo;s Instagram account, The Photo Arc,</p>
<p>he decided to take pictures of every animal on the planet,</p>
<p>especially the ones that are endangered.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an amazing photographer,</p>
<p>but his books are even better,</p>
<p>so if you like animal books.</p>
<p>What excites you most about the future research</p>
<p>of mental health treatment,</p>
<p>particularly anxiety and depression?</p>
<p>Oye.</p>
<p>Michael, thank you, Michael.</p>
<p>Well, there I think that we&rsquo;re in an exciting time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just reveal my biases.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite pessimistic at the idea</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna have better medication soon</p>
<p>for most things.</p>
<p>What I do think we are starting to approach</p>
<p>is a time in which we understand</p>
<p>how broad categories of drugs impact</p>
<p>broad categories of chemicals,</p>
<p>which kind of shift our mind</p>
<p>in broad categories of directions.</p>
<p>What does all that mean?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re starting to realize</p>
<p>that because there are different receptors</p>
<p>for all these chemicals all over the brain and body,</p>
<p>that that side-effect-less drug</p>
<p>is unlikely to exist for mental health,</p>
<p>but that the combination of maybe some pharmacology,</p>
<p>but especially behavioral tools,</p>
<p>people actually learning how to drive this thing</p>
<p>that we call our nervous system,</p>
<p>is potentially helpful, maybe very helpful.</p>
<p>Now, in cases like schizophrenia, autism,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t put those next to one another</p>
<p>for any reason, by the way,</p>
<p>OCD, eating disorders,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m very mindful of the fact that anorexia</p>
<p>is the most lethal of all the psychiatric disorders, right?</p>
<p>Amazing and sad fact.</p>
<p>I think for those conditions,</p>
<p>we are soon going to enter a time</p>
<p>in which it&rsquo;s going to be combination behavioral,</p>
<p>drug therapy, and yes, brain-machine interface.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean putting chips down below the skull.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s going to be,</p>
<p>and there are things happening now</p>
<p>of people using devices like virtual reality,</p>
<p>as well as transcranial magnetic stimulation,</p>
<p>placing a magnet on a particular location in the head,</p>
<p>combined with a particular maybe drug,</p>
<p>maybe psychedelics, maybe not, to enhance plasticity.</p>
<p>I hear a vote for psychedelics,</p>
<p>and I want to make a serious point about psychedelics.</p>
<p>Five years ago, when I, well, four years ago,</p>
<p>when I started doing a bit of public-facing stuff,</p>
<p>I was absolutely terrified to say that word.</p>
<p>Terrified.</p>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;d lose my job.</p>
<p>I really did.</p>
<p>I thought, don&rsquo;t say psychedelics.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll be very honest, you know,</p>
<p>for me, I think that the clinical data</p>
<p>on MDMA and on psilocybin are very interesting.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they are the first and only pass</p>
<p>at rewiring the brain,</p>
<p>but it is clear that the brain can enter a state</p>
<p>of heightened learning capacity,</p>
<p>but it needs to be directed towards something.</p>
<p>The goal of opening plasticity,</p>
<p>just, it opens plasticity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the goal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like running.</p>
<p>The goal isn&rsquo;t running.</p>
<p>The goal is to run in a particular direction.</p>
<p>So what I think is really needed is to drive</p>
<p>that plasticity in particular directions.</p>
<p>And I would love to see more directed use of those</p>
<p>in, of course, the safe clinical setting</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s appropriate.</p>
<p>And a guest on the podcast, Matthew Johnson,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s at Johns Hopkins,</p>
<p>I asked him, what&rsquo;s the deal with microdosing?</p>
<p>And you know what his answer was?</p>
<p>I was very surprised.</p>
<p>He said, macrodose.</p>
<p>And I thought, okay, I&rsquo;m not a guy who, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not into, I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m not a pushing this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a proponent.</p>
<p>I said, you&rsquo;re kidding me.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why, why would you say this guy runs an NIH funded lab</p>
<p>at Johns Hopkins school of medicine?</p>
<p>Thought why?</p>
<p>And he said,</p>
<p>because the one session with a trained professional</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s triggering rewiring plasticity that&rsquo;s guided</p>
<p>as far as they know from the data,</p>
<p>you can go back and listen to these are his words,</p>
<p>not mine, but he&rsquo;s the expert in this area,</p>
<p>are encouraging plasticity in a particular direction.</p>
<p>And he thinks that that&rsquo;s far more useful</p>
<p>than just kind of nudging the system a little bit</p>
<p>without any particular goal or outcome.</p>
<p>Very interesting and very surprising.</p>
<p>And again, a trained academic</p>
<p>at one of the most elite institutions in the world.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re in very exciting times</p>
<p>for those compounds.</p>
<p>And there are studies at Stanford and elsewhere</p>
<p>on ketamine and other things, but it&rsquo;s early days.</p>
<p>Young people should be very cautious, young, young people.</p>
<p>And adults should be cautious,</p>
<p>especially people with preexisting psychiatric issues</p>
<p>and people who have the propensity for addiction.</p>
<p>Although some of those compounds</p>
<p>are being used to treat addiction.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d be an idiot and I would be lying</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t say that it is very exciting time</p>
<p>for psychedelic therapies.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Where do you see the biggest area?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve done only one clinical trial.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>I took part in one clinical trial.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t speak from a lot of experience.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just a little bit.</p>
<p>I was a subject in that trial.</p>
<p>Where do you see the biggest area</p>
<p>for performance enhancement within the elite athletes</p>
<p>and operators that already hit marks</p>
<p>for proper sleep and nutrition?</p>
<p>Meg Young, thanks for your question, Meg.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that, well, first of all,</p>
<p>very few of them hit marks for proper sleep.</p>
<p>But for those that do,</p>
<p>so once you have your sleep dialed in</p>
<p>and you got your nutrition dialed in</p>
<p>and the motivational component is there,</p>
<p>I think where there&rsquo;s a lot of work still to be done</p>
<p>and where people can really get outsized effects</p>
<p>is in this weird little cavern of human existence</p>
<p>that we call creativity.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t have time to talk about it tonight.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a very unique brain state</p>
<p>that we call creativity,</p>
<p>which is taking preexisting neural maps</p>
<p>and starting to combine them in unique ways</p>
<p>to create new ways of performance.</p>
<p>Performance can be basically summarized in any domain</p>
<p>as essentially four stages.</p>
<p>You have unskilled, skilled, mastery,</p>
<p>which is when the brain can generate movements</p>
<p>or cognitive computations</p>
<p>that create very predictable outcomes.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this fourth tier,</p>
<p>this fourth layer, which is virtuosity.</p>
<p>And virtuosity, by definition,</p>
<p>means inviting back in a component of uncertainty.</p>
<p>What this looks like in terms of operators</p>
<p>or this looks like in terms of athletes,</p>
<p>or even we can say musicians</p>
<p>or people who are in the cognitive fields</p>
<p>or poets or writers,</p>
<p>what it means is introducing that uncertainty</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s gonna happen next.</p>
<p>And the way to do that is to destabilize the system.</p>
<p>In other words, to create states of mind</p>
<p>in which there are literally sensory disruptions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like what I would like to see</p>
<p>is more training in a kind of funhouse</p>
<p>of mirrors type environment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you start to see incredible performances emerge.</p>
<p>And virtuosos invite in uncertainty.</p>
<p>They actually don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re going to do next.</p>
<p>And so this becomes a little bit of a vague concept.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m about to tell you next</p>
<p>might seem a little silly,</p>
<p>but one of the best ways to access creative states</p>
<p>is to, no surprise, use your visual system</p>
<p>to view things that are highly unstable and uncertain.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just love fish tanks.</p>
<p>I love staring at videos of aquariums in Tokyo</p>
<p>and actually watching the fish</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s completely unpredictable.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some evidence that doing things like that,</p>
<p>or people will say, oh, I was in the shower.</p>
<p>I took a walk in nature and then I had this idea.</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t think it was the walk or the shower.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that nature is filled with unpredictable</p>
<p>visual stimuli, auditory stimuli.</p>
<p>When you can predict what&rsquo;s going to happen next,</p>
<p>you have very little opportunity</p>
<p>to up-level your game, so to speak.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only by way of unpredictable sensory input</p>
<p>that you can do that.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a coach or you&rsquo;re working with people</p>
<p>who are very high-level performers,</p>
<p>do you want them to stand on one leg and spin around</p>
<p>and then do what they&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>Not necessarily.</p>
<p>What you want to do is try and get them into brain states</p>
<p>that are different than the brain states</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re in when they normally enter their practice.</p>
<p>The liminal state between sleep and waking, excuse me,</p>
<p>the liminal state between sleep and waking</p>
<p>is a very powerful one for accessing creativity.</p>
<p>Many people access ideas</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re waking up in the morning.</p>
<p>They have great insights.</p>
<p>Other people, while strolling in nature,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the strolling or the waking up.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the lack of, as we call it,</p>
<p>top-down regulation on rules.</p>
<p>You are able to access combinations of neural maps</p>
<p>that are unusual.</p>
<p>So you can play with this a little bit.</p>
<p>A lot of people throughout history</p>
<p>have used compounds, drugs, to do this, right?</p>
<p>Great writers would get drunk</p>
<p>and then try and write or wake up,</p>
<p>and the amount of self-abuse that people,</p>
<p>including athletes and creatives,</p>
<p>put themselves through to try and capture</p>
<p>these windows of cognitive ability is pretty intense,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>
<p>I think one should be an explorer</p>
<p>and try and find these cognitive states</p>
<p>in ways that are non-destructive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to sound like my mother with all this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to sound like my mother with all this.</p>
<p>Heelflips on lock, no kickflips.</p>
<p>Next question.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some skateboarders in the audience,</p>
<p>my first non-biological family.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some amazing skateboarders in this audience,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not gonna be the one doing a kickflip anytime soon,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re great to have.</p>
<p>One of the reasons we built the podcast</p>
<p>with the help of the great Mike Blayback</p>
<p>is because I learned a long time ago</p>
<p>that if you want things done right</p>
<p>and you wanna do them outside the lane lines</p>
<p>and you wanna have control over how things come across,</p>
<p>you do it with skateboarders,</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t come from a community</p>
<p>where I didn&rsquo;t have parents at my sports games</p>
<p>and things like that,</p>
<p>so thanks to the skateboarders and the misfits</p>
<p>and those folks.</p>
<p>Do you have any tips on how to improve memory?</p>
<p>Yes, Ron Vred.</p>
<p>Yes, okay, this is a wild literature, and I love it,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s changing the way that I do things.</p>
<p>I thought that to remember things,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to get really, really excited,</p>
<p>really focused, and remember them,</p>
<p>and guess what, that&rsquo;s not how you do it.</p>
<p>There are data, and there are stories</p>
<p>going back to medieval times</p>
<p>that they used to teach kids things</p>
<p>and then throw them in the river.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a beautiful annual review of neuroscience</p>
<p>written by the late James McGaugh,</p>
<p>brilliant researcher who taught me that in this review,</p>
<p>and it turns out that if you want to remember something,</p>
<p>you want to spike adrenaline</p>
<p>after you acquired that information, after.</p>
<p>That means the double espresso and the ice bath</p>
<p>after you study for math, immediately after,</p>
<p>and you think about this, you know,</p>
<p>that makes perfect sense, right?</p>
<p>Think about the one trial learning</p>
<p>that nobody wants to experience,</p>
<p>which is a car accident or some traumatic thing.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t get the spike of adrenaline first,</p>
<p>you got the spike of adrenaline after,</p>
<p>so again, I discourage the use of excessive stimulants</p>
<p>or anything like that,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re going to try and remember information,</p>
<p>you need to get your brain and body</p>
<p>into a high autonomic arousal state.</p>
<p>Literally, you need to deploy adrenaline into your system</p>
<p>after you have made the attempt to learn some information,</p>
<p>so much so that if you give people a beta blocker</p>
<p>after learning emotional information,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t learn it as well.</p>
<p>Incredible, just incredible data in animals and humans.</p>
<p>This is the beautiful work of Larry Cahill</p>
<p>at UC Irvine and James McGaugh,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s how I would focus on remembering things better,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s also true that if you tell yourself</p>
<p>that something&rsquo;s really important to you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to learn it better.</p>
<p>If you meet people and they tell you their name</p>
<p>and you forget two seconds later,</p>
<p>well, you should probably be thinking,</p>
<p>and now I do this, I meet people and I think,</p>
<p>okay, what terrible thing did this person do</p>
<p>just trying to spike my adrenaline or something like that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a terrible trick,</p>
<p>but I haven&rsquo;t figured out a better way,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s actually one data-supported way to do that.</p>
<p>Easily a dozen or more studies in humans</p>
<p>on that very topic.</p>
<p>How do you manage social media addiction, Paul?</p>
<p>Well, we should be careful with the use of the word addiction</p>
<p>because here I think it&rsquo;s entirely appropriate.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re engaging in a behavior</p>
<p>over and over and over again,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re thinking to yourself,</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t even that interesting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re officially addicted.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the litmus test for addiction,</p>
<p>not this feels so good.</p>
<p>People talk about the dopamine hits of social media.</p>
<p>Those only come at the beginning,</p>
<p>but then when you find yourself scrolling,</p>
<p>like, what am I doing?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s that narrow visual aperture,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a hypnotized chicken,</p>
<p>but maybe also you are seeking more dopamine hits</p>
<p>because guess what?</p>
<p>That dopamine wave pool is depleted,</p>
<p>at least for that activity.</p>
<p>It is true that dopamine, you have a baseline,</p>
<p>and then you have peaks that ride on that baseline.</p>
<p>I do think that we can have dopamine for one behavior,</p>
<p>not for another, but it&rsquo;s a generalized phenomenon.</p>
<p>So how do you manage it?</p>
<p>You have to stop seeking within social media.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve taken on the practice of turning off my phone</p>
<p>for a couple hours each day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly hard.</p>
<p>People get really upset too, by the way,</p>
<p>in case you haven&rsquo;t noticed.</p>
<p>These tethers that people expect.</p>
<p>We recorded a podcast recently,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t want to go into too much depth now,</p>
<p>about attachment and grief.</p>
<p>And we all have a map,</p>
<p>now you know understand what the maps are,</p>
<p>of space, time, and a dimension called closeness</p>
<p>to everyone that we know.</p>
<p>Space, where they are, time, when they are,</p>
<p>dead, alive, when will I see them again, et cetera,</p>
<p>and closeness.</p>
<p>And the phone has allowed us to tap into space, time,</p>
<p>and this closeness map,</p>
<p>which define all our attachments on a very regular basis.</p>
<p>So you can understand why it&rsquo;s so valuable to people.</p>
<p>You know, the plane lands and everyone&rsquo;s texting.</p>
<p>The plane takes off, everyone&rsquo;s texting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, where are you?</p>
<p>Well, the plane&rsquo;s in the air,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this thing called flight tracker,</p>
<p>no one cares about that anymore.</p>
<p>You want to hear from the person.</p>
<p>So I do think that,</p>
<p>I used to do an every odd hour of the day,</p>
<p>my phone was off,</p>
<p>and like half the relationships in my life disappeared.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t tolerate it.</p>
<p>I loved it, but I loved them too.</p>
<p>So I would say take breaks,</p>
<p>and I would say at least an hour.</p>
<p>And if you find yourself excited to get back on the phone,</p>
<p>that excitement, that is the dopamine system.</p>
<p>So you can kind of learn where it is for you.</p>
<p>But if you find yourself scrolling mindlessly,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not doing anything for you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re driving that wave pool down, down, down, down, down.</p>
<p>So hopefully that analogy will help.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird to call myself Dr. Huberman.</p>
<p>In my business, if you refer to yourself</p>
<p>in the third person,</p>
<p>it means you&rsquo;re officially a narcissist.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just going to start with,</p>
<p>were you nervous tonight?</p>
<p>And so what did you do to prepare, Brianne?</p>
<p>You saw my nervousness, didn&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>No, I asked myself that question.</p>
<p>I was excited, and I think I&rsquo;m good at lying to myself</p>
<p>and telling myself that autonomic arousal,</p>
<p>that might be nervousness is excitement.</p>
<p>But in truth, I wasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I was and am really excited to tell you all these stories</p>
<p>and about biology.</p>
<p>I know this might sound like a little bit of a line,</p>
<p>but I actually don&rsquo;t feel myself as like a person</p>
<p>when I do the podcast or I do this stuff.</p>
<p>I took a walk before I got here,</p>
<p>and I have to be careful,</p>
<p>there are only two topics that make me cry.</p>
<p>One is talking about my bulldog,</p>
<p>the other is talking about my graduate advisor.</p>
<p>So I have to be very careful.</p>
<p>But I took a walk and I imagined that they were here.</p>
<p>And I know, I know, don&rsquo;t make me cry.</p>
<p>Lex Friedman made me cry on a podcast</p>
<p>and it was really unfair.</p>
<p>And he was like digging and digging.</p>
<p>And there are a few people in the audience</p>
<p>that know Costello and it&rsquo;s like, you know.</p>
<p>And I just kept thinking to myself before coming in here,</p>
<p>like, you know, I love them and miss them.</p>
<p>And I, Costello would be entirely bored</p>
<p>with this whole thing.</p>
<p>So I distracted myself a bit and not so nervous.</p>
<p>I do get nervous about things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m human.</p>
<p>But when it comes to biology,</p>
<p>I think I still feel like that little kid</p>
<p>who just wants to tell you all this stuff, you know.</p>
<p>So, you know, can&rsquo;t help it.</p>
<p>Is learning from failure equal to learning from success?</p>
<p>Is one more efficient than the other?</p>
<p>Rachel, thanks for your question.</p>
<p>Well, on a trial by trial basis,</p>
<p>we know that when you fail at an attempt,</p>
<p>on the next attempt,</p>
<p>your forebrain is in a position to engage better.</p>
<p>And this makes total sense, right?</p>
<p>You feel that frustration.</p>
<p>And you want to get the next one, right?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re harboring, or I should say,</p>
<p>funneling more neural resources.</p>
<p>Your focus, that aperture, tightens.</p>
<p>Now you have to be mindful of that too,</p>
<p>because when you have a failure</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re gonna hit the bullseye.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about a dartboard</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m terrible at darts.</p>
<p>You know, sober, I&rsquo;m terrible at darts.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t even drink.</p>
<p>So that next trial, part of the problem is,</p>
<p>that focus can narrow so much</p>
<p>that you can start to lose access to information</p>
<p>that might help you if you were just to relax a little bit</p>
<p>and dilate that focus a little bit.</p>
<p>But in general, on a trial by trial basis,</p>
<p>focus is the cue that your nervous system</p>
<p>is going to be positioned to learn better on the next trial.</p>
<p>Now, in terms of life experiences,</p>
<p>gosh, I wish for everyone fewer failures and more successes.</p>
<p>But, you know, failures keep you humble.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had a lot of them.</p>
<p>I mean, if people ever wanted</p>
<p>and they, you know, I&rsquo;d be happy to tell you about.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve made a ton of mistakes in life,</p>
<p>a ton of mistakes.</p>
<p>Some of those were mistakes of persistence,</p>
<p>like dumb decisions.</p>
<p>I kept, like, it&rsquo;s gonna change, it&rsquo;s gonna change.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s clearly never gonna change.</p>
<p>And then some were failures of misjudgment</p>
<p>about other people or situations.</p>
<p>And a lot of them were just plain failures,</p>
<p>like the experiment didn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>or it just wasn&rsquo;t the right thing.</p>
<p>And you try and reframe those.</p>
<p>I do think that we owe it to ourselves</p>
<p>and to the people that we know</p>
<p>to try and generate some wins here and there</p>
<p>and try and help other people generate wins.</p>
<p>You know, in running a lab over the years, and I still do,</p>
<p>you realize that you want your students to publish a paper</p>
<p>and feel that success pretty early</p>
<p>so that they can experience, A, how much work it is,</p>
<p>so they pick problems wisely,</p>
<p>but B, so they can feel that, like, oh, I can do this.</p>
<p>And I think that, you know,</p>
<p>this gets into the psychological as well.</p>
<p>I think that, yes, failures help, but successes help.</p>
<p>And there, I think, you know, I function best in a team.</p>
<p>And I think that for those of you</p>
<p>that feel like you&rsquo;re fighting some challenge alone,</p>
<p>I do think that there are great resources to be had</p>
<p>in trying to access other people as sources of support.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s a great tool.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this whole literature, scientific literature,</p>
<p>around social connection</p>
<p>and how that can help us reframe motivation and goals.</p>
<p>Anyway, maybe that&rsquo;s a topic to expand on another time.</p>
<p>But failure is important on a trial-trial basis.</p>
<p>People who don&rsquo;t experience enough wins</p>
<p>for a long period of time,</p>
<p>the brain is a prediction machine after all,</p>
<p>and they start to predict failure.</p>
<p>So it takes a bit more work to wedge oneself out of that.</p>
<p>When are you gonna start training jujitsu?</p>
<p>Lex made me ask, Ryan Flores.</p>
<p>Okay, here&rsquo;s the story with that.</p>
<p>Lex said, do you wanna try jujitsu?</p>
<p>I said, sure.</p>
<p>Lex said, okay, it&rsquo;ll be great</p>
<p>to show people a beginner&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>I said, sure.</p>
<p>We went and did a jujitsu class.</p>
<p>He was very nice, nice, nice, Russian, nice,</p>
<p>like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Then he puts it on the internet with me in a rear naked,</p>
<p>him putting me in a rear naked choke.</p>
<p>It was actually Lex Friedman choking out Andrew Huberman.</p>
<p>There, I just talked about myself in the third person.</p>
<p>Damn it.</p>
<p>Edit that one.</p>
<p>I have not had the time for jujitsu.</p>
<p>I like my ears the way they are, you know?</p>
<p>Have you ever seen these people that do jujitsu?</p>
<p>Their ears literally look like stomps.</p>
<p>No, I should do it.</p>
<p>It looks like a great sport.</p>
<p>And unlike the other sports I&rsquo;ve been involved in</p>
<p>in my life, boxing, please don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not healthy.</p>
<p>Skateboarding, all this,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t really damage your head doing jujitsu.</p>
<p>So, no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get you back for that one, Lex.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Can you go through, oh, wow, John Edwards.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a joke that my friends used to tell</p>
<p>about the supplements I take.</p>
<p>They used to say,</p>
<p>someone would say, what supplements do you take?</p>
<p>And they would just go, all of them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t take all of them,</p>
<p>but I have been very systematic.</p>
<p>For about 30 years, I&rsquo;ve been interested in compounds</p>
<p>that change the nervous system.</p>
<p>And I do think that the events of the last few years</p>
<p>have changed the way that people view supplements.</p>
<p>I think that more people are starting to think about</p>
<p>how to take better care of their health.</p>
<p>And people are realizing that, obviously,</p>
<p>great sleep, mindsets, social connection,</p>
<p>exercise, nutrition, and so forth are very important.</p>
<p>But I actually don&rsquo;t know anybody,</p>
<p>granted I run with a strange crowd,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know anybody</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t take something nowadays.</p>
<p>You know, I could go through the whole list,</p>
<p>but I would say the most fundamental things,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no product pitch here,</p>
<p>the most fundamental things are</p>
<p>the things that are going to support</p>
<p>your kind of foundational health.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s going to mean mainly getting,</p>
<p>either by food sources or supplements,</p>
<p>is gonna be getting sufficient amounts</p>
<p>of these essential fatty acids.</p>
<p>So important.</p>
<p>For some people, that&rsquo;s taking liquid fish oil.</p>
<p>For some people, it&rsquo;s capsules.</p>
<p>For some people, it&rsquo;s eating fish.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the way fish tastes,</p>
<p>unless I&rsquo;m in Seattle.</p>
<p>By the way, the seafood here is amazing.</p>
<p>Not so much in California.</p>
<p>So, I think the essential fatty acids,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m big on the data,</p>
<p>dare I say, out of Stanford,</p>
<p>Justin Sonnenberg&rsquo;s lab and Chris Gardner&rsquo;s lab,</p>
<p>that these fermented foods,</p>
<p>of which all these cultures have interesting</p>
<p>fermented foods, kefir and sauerkraut and kimchi,</p>
<p>and pick your fermented food,</p>
<p>that those seem to really encourage</p>
<p>health of the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>So, I started eating a lot of those</p>
<p>and taking no probiotics,</p>
<p>except in a few of the supplements</p>
<p>that I was already taking.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m not trying to dodge the question,</p>
<p>but I think, by and large,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re eating well</p>
<p>and doing the other foundational behaviors well,</p>
<p>you can get away with a minimum of supplements.</p>
<p>D3, it seems to be a lot of people deficient in D3,</p>
<p>but not everybody.</p>
<p>So, I think those are the main ones, however.</p>
<p>I do think that nutrition should be the primary entry point.</p>
<p>Again, it should be behaviors first,</p>
<p>then nutrition, then supplements,</p>
<p>then prescription drugs, only if you need them.</p>
<p>And then, for some people,</p>
<p>their brain-machine interface,</p>
<p>like TMS and things like that,</p>
<p>are going to be useful.</p>
<p>But behaviors change your nervous system.</p>
<p>No supplement actually rewires you</p>
<p>or changes your nervous system.</p>
<p>Behaviors do that.</p>
<p>I hope I didn&rsquo;t dodge that question entirely.</p>
<p>I do take some of the things</p>
<p>that we talk about on the podcast</p>
<p>to do some focused work sometimes, alpha GPC.</p>
<p>But lately, I&rsquo;ve been doing this whole thing</p>
<p>of cold water exposure to spike my adrenaline,</p>
<p>because I hate it,</p>
<p>and it spikes my adrenaline after learning</p>
<p>based on the McGaughan-Cahill data.</p>
<p>What would be your best one or two pieces of advice</p>
<p>to recommend or protocols for improving learning</p>
<p>and retention for graduate students</p>
<p>in science and medicine?</p>
<p>We try to sleep sometimes.</p>
<p>Thank you, JD.</p>
<p>Oh, great, UW, JD.</p>
<p>So, you know, I used to teach this course</p>
<p>at Cold Spring Harbor on career development for scientists.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot in there.</p>
<p>But the two things that are most important</p>
<p>are, for sake of answering this question,</p>
<p>I would say are,</p>
<p>find non-destructive ways</p>
<p>to reset your dopamine and your energy levels</p>
<p>and do those at least every three days.</p>
<p>So for me, it was kind of a tough thing</p>
<p>to take a long walk or to spend,</p>
<p>I used to work really hard on Mondays,</p>
<p>really hard on Tuesdays,</p>
<p>and I would not go in until the afternoon on Wednesdays,</p>
<p>and sometimes not at all.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;d go in Thursday, Friday,</p>
<p>and work really, really hard,</p>
<p>and then not at all on Saturday,</p>
<p>and then maybe do a little bit of work from home on Sunday.</p>
<p>And I was very productive that way.</p>
<p>Those breaks are absolutely key,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not encouraged so much in academic or tech,</p>
<p>or maybe anything now.</p>
<p>I hear about so much stress and overwork.</p>
<p>I say, you just do it and define the culture</p>
<p>and let the results and your focus be the thing</p>
<p>that defines you, not how many hours you&rsquo;re in there.</p>
<p>But I realize there&rsquo;s a huge cognitive load</p>
<p>and energetic load, and for that,</p>
<p>I do think these non-sleep deep rest protocols</p>
<p>are where it comes in really handy.</p>
<p>There are at least two faculty I know at Stanford,</p>
<p>one who&rsquo;s a so-called Howard Hughes investigator,</p>
<p>those are big deal appointments.</p>
<p>They get tons of money, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>And they do amazing science most of the time.</p>
<p>These individuals certainly do.</p>
<p>And they take two 20-minute naps per day in their office.</p>
<p>When this guy came and visited me years ago</p>
<p>when I was at a different university,</p>
<p>he took the time that we were supposed to meet in my office</p>
<p>and talk about data, he asked if he could take a nap.</p>
<p>And he gave a great talk that afternoon.</p>
<p>So there you go.</p>
<p>I do think you have to take control of your schedule</p>
<p>and do those things, and I hope that helps.</p>
<p>And then, of course, for some people,</p>
<p>exercise and so on is the way they reset.</p>
<p>What research or work are you doing</p>
<p>or that your colleagues are doing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re most excited about lately?</p>
<p>Glenn, yeah.</p>
<p>One project in particular,</p>
<p>I hope this paper gets accepted soon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been out for review forever.</p>
<p>If the viewers are in the audience, please,</p>
<p>just tell us one way or the other, you know?</p>
<p>We did a very large-scale study during the pandemic,</p>
<p>we meaning David Spiegel and I,</p>
<p>and an amazing PhD named Malise Yilmaz Balban.</p>
<p>And Malise, we essentially equipped people</p>
<p>with remote monitoring devices and measured sleep</p>
<p>and heart rate variability and a bunch of stress</p>
<p>and a bunch of other things,</p>
<p>and we gave them a very brief set of breathing protocols.</p>
<p>And it turns out that this thing</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m talking about a lot on the podcast these days</p>
<p>of this double inhale-long exhale,</p>
<p>the so-called physiological sigh,</p>
<p>was the most effective breathing practice</p>
<p>for allowing people to control their heart rate variability,</p>
<p>reduce overall heart rate, access better sleep,</p>
<p>and these were extremely short protocols.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very excited about this.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t discover physiological sighs.</p>
<p>I love the idea that people can do</p>
<p>a very brief protocol once a day,</p>
<p>maybe even just while walking down the street</p>
<p>or in a moment, and actually learn to control</p>
<p>that autonomic seesaw better.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very excited about that.</p>
<p>And then we are gearing up to do some studies</p>
<p>on people who have more severe forms of anxiety</p>
<p>and panic attack using mainly respiration,</p>
<p>but also looking at some of these eye-vision-related ways</p>
<p>of controlling the nervous system.</p>
<p>I love that stuff.</p>
<p>If I keep talking about it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give you a data presentation,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m gonna turn around.</p>
<p>How does dopamine factor into neuroplasticity, if at all?</p>
<p>Colin, great question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very strong trigger of plasticity,</p>
<p>so much so, in fact, that there&rsquo;s some work</p>
<p>that shows if you stimulate with an electrode,</p>
<p>the brain area that releases dopamine,</p>
<p>and you pair that with anything, anything,</p>
<p>even just like an eight-kilohertz tone,</p>
<p>the brain remaps, and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, I love that eight-kilohertz tone.</p>
<p>Remember, dopamine is dumb, and it&rsquo;s just dumb,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just, you know, it&rsquo;s like Costello</p>
<p>when he said, this dog, I could hang a rope from a tree.</p>
<p>This dog was so lazy, it wouldn&rsquo;t cross a room for a steak.</p>
<p>You had to give the steak to him,</p>
<p>but it would run across a field.</p>
<p>He would run and jump on and hold onto that rope,</p>
<p>and he would suddenly bite through his lip</p>
<p>with like blood dripping down, and I was like,</p>
<p>oh my God, it was like breaking my heart.</p>
<p>He loved every, that&rsquo;s dopamine.</p>
<p>It turns us into idiots.</p>
<p>He was smart about what he needed to be smart about.</p>
<p>Dopamine, so if you trigger dopamine release</p>
<p>with Ritalin, Adderall, to a lesser extent,</p>
<p>L-tyrosine, and certainly, please don&rsquo;t do this,</p>
<p>but cocaine, amphetamine, whatever you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>seems super interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true, and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s such a slippery slope.</p>
<p>It makes anything you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>seem interesting and important,</p>
<p>and actually, I&rsquo;ll use this as an opportunity</p>
<p>to say something about the psychedelic thing earlier.</p>
<p>One of the issues with MDMA,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very unusual brain state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s high dopamine, high serotonin,</p>
<p>completely synthetic compound.</p>
<p>There are other things in there that it does as well.</p>
<p>One of the problems with people I see</p>
<p>with the problem with people taking MDMA</p>
<p>just at a basic level is that if you&rsquo;re not pushing that</p>
<p>towards some therapeutic outcome, music sounds amazing.</p>
<p>Everything feels and sounds amazing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a very neurochemically severe state,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why I think if people are going</p>
<p>to explore those things, do it as part</p>
<p>of one of the university-supported clinical trials.</p>
<p>Those drugs make everything seem interesting,</p>
<p>even stuff that&rsquo;s not terribly interesting.</p>
<p>Now, they also have the potential</p>
<p>for trauma healing capacity.</p>
<p>These are the MAP studies and so on,</p>
<p>so you have to be very careful</p>
<p>with what you pair with dopamine</p>
<p>and what you pair dopamine with,</p>
<p>and for those of you that are high sensation-seeking,</p>
<p>novelty-seeking, and everything&rsquo;s interesting to you,</p>
<p>and you want more and more and more experiences,</p>
<p>you basically have a eight-cylinder car in you,</p>
<p>and you need to be very careful how you drive that thing.</p>
<p>Like any high-performance automobile,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to spend more time in the shop,</p>
<p>so learn to drive appropriately.</p>
<p>What advice can you offer to future scientists</p>
<p>who want to make an impact like you have?</p>
<p>Ryan O&rsquo;Boyle, get tenure first.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m kidding.</p>
<p>So I have this weird history in science,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not looking for sympathy here,</p>
<p>but my undergraduate advisor, who I adored,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like a father to me, my graduate advisor,</p>
<p>and my post-doc advisor, who I also adored,</p>
<p>all three of them died.</p>
<p>Suicide, cancer, cancer.</p>
<p>Really young.</p>
<p>So the joke in my field is,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want me to work for you.</p>
<p>But in all seriousness,</p>
<p>all three of them had a really morbid sense of humor,</p>
<p>all amazing people,</p>
<p>but it is this kind of weird curse that I&rsquo;ve had.</p>
<p>So what scientists, you know, what advice, you know,</p>
<p>well, Ben Barris, the late Ben Barris,</p>
<p>died of pancreatic cancer, an amazing individual.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually making a documentary about Ben&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>He was transgendered, he was totally irreverent,</p>
<p>he said whatever he thought, he offended everybody,</p>
<p>he was awesome.</p>
<p>Brilliant, too.</p>
<p>Ben and I had a conversation as he was dying.</p>
<p>I recorded a lot of conversations with him,</p>
<p>and I told him I was interested</p>
<p>in doing public-facing education,</p>
<p>and he said, well, you&rsquo;re tenured now,</p>
<p>and people are gonna be upset,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not gonna like it,</p>
<p>and your colleagues are probably gonna hate it,</p>
<p>so whatever you do, you better make it good.</p>
<p>And I was like, wow, that doesn&rsquo;t really help much, Ben.</p>
<p>And he said, you know, you seem to have a compulsion for it.</p>
<p>So he was right.</p>
<p>I think that if you are excited about science,</p>
<p>and sharing what you know, then do that.</p>
<p>And even if it seems super nerdy,</p>
<p>I mean, there are these, I think they call themselves</p>
<p>entomologists, the insect people?</p>
<p>I mean, they make insects seem really, really cool.</p>
<p>And if you are excited about spindle kinetics, or whatever,</p>
<p>you know, tell people about it.</p>
<p>I really mean it.</p>
<p>I think that the one caveat is that</p>
<p>I do think it&rsquo;s important to get</p>
<p>a formal, rigorous training in at first.</p>
<p>I think that you will go further and faster</p>
<p>in the long run.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some amazing people out there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a postdoc at Stanford, I think his name is Ben Reen.</p>
<p>I think if you shorten it up on Instagram,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually Brain, Brain,</p>
<p>because he talks about brain science.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s weird, B-R-E-I-N.</p>
<p>He does a great job, and he&rsquo;s a really good example</p>
<p>of someone who&rsquo;s still on the ascent with his career,</p>
<p>doing serious science and doing science communication.</p>
<p>But you have to be careful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time-consuming.</p>
<p>Look, people will dislike you for whatever.</p>
<p>I made the mistake once of saying that I eat butter.</p>
<p>Apparently, that&rsquo;s a sin on the internet.</p>
<p>I like little bits of butter.</p>
<p>I actually like a lot of butter,</p>
<p>but I try and eat little bits of butter.</p>
<p>But somehow, it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s this idea</p>
<p>that I eat sticks of butter.</p>
<p>So you have to be careful.</p>
<p>I mean, of the things I&rsquo;ve heard,</p>
<p>I heard I was dead.</p>
<p>That was cool.</p>
<p>So you have to be careful.</p>
<p>And remember, everything is stamped into the cloud now,</p>
<p>and the metaverse, or whatever it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>So I would say, here are the rules that we have.</p>
<p>At the podcast, and on,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the rules that I created for myself.</p>
<p>I truly don&rsquo;t do it for me.</p>
<p>I do it because I think people want to hear about it.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve been telling myself that since I was six years old.</p>
<p>The other thing is, never, ever, ever do it</p>
<p>just for your own gratification.</p>
<p>You should really try and think,</p>
<p>is anyone gonna get anything useful out of this,</p>
<p>potentially?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the goal.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing that, it&rsquo;ll work out for you.</p>
<p>If you are thinking about how to get followers</p>
<p>or something like that, it ain&rsquo;t gonna work out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my advice.</p>
<p>Is age 66 too old for neuroplasty?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ll cut myself off.</p>
<p>To begin learning, Sandra Tresari.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Did I pronounce that right?</p>
<p>Thank you, Sandra.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Richard Feynman, the great Richard Feynman,</p>
<p>taught himself to draw later in life.</p>
<p>He was also really into flotation tanks.</p>
<p>Did you know that?</p>
<p>Yeah, he was also into bongo drumming naked</p>
<p>on the roof of Caltech.</p>
<p>Richard Feynman did so many things</p>
<p>that would get most people fired nowadays.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just lucky he was alive when he was.</p>
<p>You can absolutely learn at 66 and way beyond.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an amazing study from Rusty Gage&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>at the Salk Institute years ago</p>
<p>showing that even people who are very late in life,</p>
<p>terminally ill, in fact, are still producing new neurons</p>
<p>in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.</p>
<p>These people were gracious enough</p>
<p>to allow researchers to inject them with dyes</p>
<p>that would label these neurons for analysis post-mortem</p>
<p>after they died.</p>
<p>Absolutely, you can learn.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s harder is focus.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, what&rsquo;s harder is sleep as well,</p>
<p>but the same mechanisms apply.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no evidence whatsoever</p>
<p>that neuroplasticity disappears at any stage,</p>
<p>despite what Hubel and Wiesel told the BBC.</p>
<p>How do you tackle reading research papers?</p>
<p>Do you have a specific strategy, Anne Hunt?</p>
<p>Yes, I do.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I take notes on everything.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s four questions that we teach students</p>
<p>and that I think that I use.</p>
<p>The first one is, what&rsquo;s the question they&rsquo;re asking,</p>
<p>major and more specific?</p>
<p>Second is, what do they do, methods-wise, what do they do?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to know all the details</p>
<p>in the methods necessarily,</p>
<p>but be versed in those methods.</p>
<p>You have to understand, are they looking at mice?</p>
<p>Are they looking at humans?</p>
<p>Did they have people in two different conditions</p>
<p>or just one?</p>
<p>You have to understand, what do they do?</p>
<p>Then you ask, what did they find?</p>
<p>The last question is the most important one.</p>
<p>You should write down the answer to this</p>
<p>is, what did they conclude?</p>
<p>Then you look back at the first question</p>
<p>and you go, did they actually answer that question</p>
<p>or is it something unrelated?</p>
<p>Those four questions are essentially</p>
<p>the way that I parse each paper.</p>
<p>Learning to parse papers is tricky.</p>
<p>For the podcast, I use the telephone.</p>
<p>I call people and I badger them and I ask them,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s doing the really good work in this area?</p>
<p>I spend a lot of hours doing it.</p>
<p>Then the best way to remember science</p>
<p>is to tell someone about it.</p>
<p>Before each podcast, I&rsquo;ll call someone and be like,</p>
<p>hey, did you know that they used to throw kids in the river?</p>
<p>I do this and my sister, my poor sister,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like, yeah.</p>
<p>My sister, by the way, does not watch the podcast.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a therapist and she&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>hey, I learned this amazing breathing technique.</p>
<p>I was like, oh yeah, really?</p>
<p>Tell me about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like someone else is there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you know I have a podcast.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t like your podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s older sister.</p>
<p>Older sister.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not lying.</p>
<p>What is your favorite sauce, condiment, seasoning, sauce?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one in every audience.</p>
<p>I like the spicy stuff.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been fermenting our own food at home.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of cool.</p>
<p>You put the cabbage and the stuff</p>
<p>in the little ceramic thing outside</p>
<p>and then it goes pop, pop.</p>
<p>It makes this amazing sound</p>
<p>and then you can make your own sauerkraut.</p>
<p>You can do that with peppers</p>
<p>and fermenting that stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>Okay, they&rsquo;re telling me one more question,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ll do two.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s most important from your ADH?</p>
<p>Ah, Gabriel.</p>
<p>A lot of questions about ADHD.</p>
<p>For people on medication or not on medication?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll answer both.</p>
<p>For people on medication,</p>
<p>I think work with somebody really good</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s willing to work with you</p>
<p>to allow you to find that minimal effective dose</p>
<p>and also timing that dose.</p>
<p>One of the key things that we know now</p>
<p>is that from that waking up point in your morning</p>
<p>until about eight or nine hours later,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve sort of named that phase one of the day</p>
<p>for lack of a better naming protocol.</p>
<p>The systems that release cortisol, dopamine,</p>
<p>and epinephrine are essentially more effective</p>
<p>at producing those than they are</p>
<p>in the later periods of the day,</p>
<p>which makes sense if you think about</p>
<p>the way that the autonomic nervous system works, et cetera.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an important question</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t answer for you but you can answer for you,</p>
<p>which is if you&rsquo;re using Ritalin, Adderall, Vyvanse,</p>
<p>these things that enhance dopaminergic transmission,</p>
<p>modafinil, armodafinil.</p>
<p>By the way, for the people in the audience like me</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t go to college when these things were all in use,</p>
<p>the numbers of people that use these compounds</p>
<p>on and off prescription is astronomical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize it.</p>
<p>I think something like 80% of college students</p>
<p>use these at some point.</p>
<p>Incredible, because they put you into</p>
<p>a narrow aperture tunnel of concentration.</p>
<p>So you want to, with a physician&rsquo;s support, of course,</p>
<p>to help get permission or not,</p>
<p>to figure out what time of day to take your medication.</p>
<p>Now, for people who are not on medication,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just go right back to what I said earlier,</p>
<p>which is that you can train focus,</p>
<p>but it feels terrible to train it.</p>
<p>It is hard.</p>
<p>Again, there are these large-scale studies in China</p>
<p>and elsewhere of people literally teaching themselves,</p>
<p>and yes, they blink, although less often,</p>
<p>to focus their vision on a narrow aperture</p>
<p>and to really battle through that agitation,</p>
<p>stress, and learn how to keep their focus.</p>
<p>Now, focus will drift, right?</p>
<p>Focus is not a constant.</p>
<p>Focus will drift, and you pop out of focus states</p>
<p>and then refocus and pop out and refocus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that you can train up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard from many people who&rsquo;ve managed</p>
<p>to train themselves off medication</p>
<p>or to lower doses of medication,</p>
<p>and look, some people can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>They absolutely have to maintain</p>
<p>their standard medication protocols.</p>
<p>This is a larger discussion, obviously,</p>
<p>as it relates to ADHD.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna do another episode on ADHD</p>
<p>because the data are coming out so, so fast.</p>
<p>What future episodes are in the pipeline, David Nguyen?</p>
<p>Okay, thank you for that question.</p>
<p>We have one on grief.</p>
<p>We have an amazing episode with a guy</p>
<p>from the Rockefeller University on the,</p>
<p>this is, am I allowed to say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be my favorite episode?</p>
<p>I love all the guests, but this episode</p>
<p>just blew me away on the relationship</p>
<p>between language, speech, dance, and music,</p>
<p>and I have no musical talent</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not a very good dancer, so,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s being generous.</p>
<p>Amazing interplay between those things.</p>
<p>Exercise in the brain, OCD, bulimia, binge eating disorder.</p>
<p>Peter Attia&rsquo;s coming on.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll teach us about everything,</p>
<p>medicine and longevity,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m kind of blanking at the moment.</p>
<p>David Anderson from Caltech</p>
<p>on aggression and emotional states.</p>
<p>Amazing, and then there are a number of people,</p>
<p>Lisa Feldman Barrett, or Barrett Feldman,</p>
<p>I always get it backwards, sorry Lisa,</p>
<p>on emotions in the brain,</p>
<p>and really we do take suggestions</p>
<p>about who to bring on the podcast very seriously.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re mostly looking for,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re mostly looking for are the people</p>
<p>that no one else has heard,</p>
<p>that people haven&rsquo;t heard of,</p>
<p>who are not going on podcasts every week,</p>
<p>and that people should absolutely hear from,</p>
<p>and then I will tell you,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna kill me for saying this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m gonna do it anyway.</p>
<p>We have some short series coming up</p>
<p>with expert professionals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do a short series on trauma,</p>
<p>and my hope for this series is that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll actually get to see an exquisitely skilled</p>
<p>trauma therapist take someone through,</p>
<p>excuse me, I seem so excited, I&rsquo;m spitting on the audience.</p>
<p>Excuse me, to take someone through actual trauma therapy,</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t staged, this is somebody who&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>in a point of near suicidal grief and trauma,</p>
<p>taking them through it in the course of the podcast</p>
<p>so that people can see what this process actually entails.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very meaningful project to me</p>
<p>for a number of reasons,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re really excited about that,</p>
<p>and to be honest, I feel like there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>such a treasure trove of information out there,</p>
<p>I just wanna grab it all and tell you all about it until,</p>
<p>I always say, if nothing else, I&rsquo;ll cure insomnia.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you, appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time.</p>
<p>I really appreciate everyone coming out on the weekday</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>thank you for your interest in science.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
