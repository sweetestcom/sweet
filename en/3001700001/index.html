    <p>Hello. I&rsquo;m Susan. I&rsquo;m Gurindji Woolwonga</p>
<p>With deep honor and respect</p>
<p>I asked to speak to the male spirits,</p>
<p>I asked to speak to the female spirits for permission for all of us together</p>
<p>on Gadigal land.</p>
<p>Hello, Sydney.</p>
<p>And hello to all</p>
<p>of those who are online</p>
<p>and to all of</p>
<p>those who are online, globally, around the world,</p>
<p>who are tuning in this afternoon.</p>
<p>My name is Susan Moylan Coombs</p>
<p>and my ancestry is from the oldest living culture on the planet.</p>
<p>We are the original people.</p>
<p>Good design</p>
<p>based in our indigenous knowledge systems,</p>
<p>have grounded us in country.</p>
<p>We also are the oldest</p>
<p>living culture, so our culture has also grounded us</p>
<p>and we have been here since time immemorial.</p>
<p>So through the lens of the tribe, sacred,</p>
<p>we are connected by the three worlds</p>
<p>the physical world, the human world, and the sacred world.</p>
<p>But like the three legged stool,</p>
<p>if you take one of those legs away, it simply falls over.</p>
<p>When we honor, respect</p>
<p>and play our role in understanding, everything is connected,</p>
<p>then every action we take there is a reaction.</p>
<p>So my question to you</p>
<p>is what is going to be your legacy?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about planting the seeds of the tree</p>
<p>of the shade that you will never sit under.</p>
<p>But your children, your grandchildren</p>
<p>and your great grandchildren will be able to enjoy that.</p>
<p>So you are gifting it forward.</p>
<p>We all have our</p>
<p>own life journey and that which has shaped us.</p>
<p>We all have our own mindset</p>
<p>and our own viewpoints.</p>
<p>Be comfortable in your own skin</p>
<p>so you can be comfortable with others.</p>
<p>Listen with the intention of hearing and understanding others</p>
<p>and not just replying in a conversation.</p>
<p>Use words of kindness, compassion,</p>
<p>wisdom and love in every interaction that you have.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me here to do the acknowledgment of country.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to acknowledge all of us here in the audience today,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d like to acknowledge elders,</p>
<p>knowledge holders and wisdom keepers</p>
<p>as we embark on new eras and new beginnings,</p>
<p>Honor, protect and care for country.</p>
<p>Because country will protect you.</p>
<p>So we believe that we are born of country.</p>
<p>That as we live life, we walk country.</p>
<p>And when we die, we go back to country.</p>
<p>So we go back to the mother.</p>
<p>So listen, with your heart,</p>
<p>do good in the world,</p>
<p>and of course, it&rsquo;s a choice.</p>
<p>So the rest is up to you, what you do next.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>In a world that never stops,</p>
<p>how do you stay on topic</p>
<p>as this mind bending ever</p>
<p>pending chase of what&rsquo;s trending feels never ending,</p>
<p>how do you mark the end of an era in order to own</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s next, What&rsquo;s now, What&rsquo;s new.</p>
<p>Perhaps you start by asking yourself</p>
<p>what makes you, you?</p>
<p>Then take that authentic you and enhance the resolution.</p>
<p>Help the scale of you grow up so that the you-iest</p>
<p>version of you stands out whenever you show up.</p>
<p>For this is the era of you. The era of new. The</p>
<p>Era of we empowering what creatives do</p>
<p>we are conductors moving creativity from cacophony to concert,</p>
<p>keeping the magic and making while adding clarity to creating.</p>
<p>This is creativity with four bars. Possibility fully charged.</p>
<p>A new way of working this visual economy that&rsquo;s joyfully evolved</p>
<p>Where we manage to do less and achieve so much more</p>
<p>from those who work heads up</p>
<p>to those who work hands on. In this</p>
<p>new age of scale and speed,</p>
<p>it is our new</p>
<p>ways that prevail and lead, for this</p>
<p>is the era of action meets inspiration.</p>
<p>This is the era of access to imagination, and it is ours by design</p>
<p>For we embrace the new together.</p>
<p>We design this brand new</p>
<p>era.</p>
<p>Wow. Wow. Wow.</p>
<p>That was the amazing Grammy nominated,</p>
<p>spoken word poet and Canva Community member,</p>
<p>Sekou Andrews.</p>
<p>Give it up! Woo!</p>
<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>Good afternoon and good evening.</p>
<p>Whether you are here in our live audience or joining in from around the globe.</p>
<p>A very warm welcome to all of you.</p>
<p>Now, do you know how many people are actually tuning in today?</p>
<p>Oh, I lost count I think we had 300,000, So maybe 500,000 this time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to need to add a little bit more than that.</p>
<p>Okay. At a stretch, what do you reckon?</p>
<p>600,000? Higher.</p>
<p>800,000? Close.</p>
<p>Can you believe tuning in from around the globe,</p>
<p>there are over 1.5 million people tuning in</p>
<p>today.</p>
<p>Well, hello 1.5 million people!</p>
<p>We are incredibly.</p>
<p>excited to welcome every one of you to our second Canva</p>
<p>Create. The theme</p>
<p>last time we were on stage was the Future is Visual.</p>
<p>And that future has now arrived.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re here standing at the dawn of a brand new era.</p>
<p>But what is a brand new era?</p>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a brand new era</p>
<p>because as the web in the world become increasingly visual places,</p>
<p>the need for companies to be world</p>
<p>class visual communicators is more important than ever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a brand new era for schools as visual communication</p>
<p>has become a critical part of every classroom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a brand new era for technology.</p>
<p>Canva was born at a major inflection point when breakthroughs</p>
<p>in technology opened up entirely new ways of working.</p>
<p>Today, we have once again found ourselves at the precipice</p>
<p>as new technology is enabling us to reimagine</p>
<p>the design process and help everyone achieve their goals.</p>
<p>So to celebrate our 10th birthday, which is happening later this year,</p>
<p>we thought it would be fun to show our appreciation to all of our</p>
<p>community members across the globe</p>
<p>and drop some very special gifts on each of their home pages.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of anticipation about these gifts</p>
<p>and what secrets might be contained within these mysterious presents.</p>
<p>And it has been a lot of fun</p>
<p>seeing all the wild guesses about what these gifts might hold.</p>
<p>And there has been some very crafty detective work as well.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m very excited to say that today is the day</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re going to be seeing inside what is in all of these presents.</p>
<p>And very excitingly, you&rsquo;ll get a chance to explore these gifts for yourself</p>
<p>in just a moment.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll also have the unique opportunity to meet some of the 3,500</p>
<p>very talented</p>
<p>people from our team at Canva who have been working extraordinarily hard</p>
<p>to bring these gifts to life and craft the products you all know and love.</p>
<p>Last time we were on this stage, I said, it takes a village to raise a company.</p>
<p>While that is certainly true, I now know it actually takes a small city.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Our mission is the same today as when we first launched Canva,</p>
<p>and that is to empower the world to design.</p>
<p>Back in</p>
<p>September, we talked about our wild dream of taking the world&rsquo;s best technology</p>
<p>integrated into one simple to use platform and making it accessible</p>
<p>to the whole world,</p>
<p>empowering everyone to achieve their personal and professional goals with ease.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m happy to say that we&rsquo;ve done it.</p>
<p>Following the launch of the Visual Communication Suite.</p>
<p>With the launch of Canva Docs, we brought docs to life with visuals</p>
<p>and enabled everyone to transform their designs</p>
<p>into beautiful presentations with just a click.</p>
<p>With the launch of Canva Whiteboards, we introduced</p>
<p>brand new ways to collaborate, brainstorm and ideate.</p>
<p>And with the launch of Canva Video,</p>
<p>we made it easier than ever to create professional and engaging</p>
<p>content with new features like Video Background Remover.</p>
<p>And then with the launch of Print, we unlocked even more magical products,</p>
<p>making it quick and easy to get your designs printed</p>
<p>and delivered to your door.</p>
<p>And with the launch of Canva Websites, we made it possible to create anything</p>
<p>from landing pages to portfolios with just a few clicks.</p>
<p>Wow. That was a lot.</p>
<p>It sure was.</p>
<p>Should we wrap it all up in a rap?</p>
<p>Well, my rapping skills aren&rsquo;t really anything to be written about, so</p>
<p>maybe we should bring in someone that has a little more experience in this regard.</p>
<p>So we recently launched a new campaign and we have the amazing Roger Coles</p>
<p>rapping in the background.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s play that badboy.</p>
<p>Want to make your presentation</p>
<p>Wow? With Canva</p>
<p>you can amaze the crowd Want to brainstorm? Put your pencils down.</p>
<p>Online Whiteboards</p>
<p>ideas all around Coming in hot with a Canva Doc</p>
<p>Docs and decks, I like it</p>
<p>a lot. Design a website quick in minutes give the videos to one stop shop.</p>
<p>You can do design with ease, print for free delivery.</p>
<p>Make your work feel like a breeze.</p>
<p>Beautiful templates. Yes please</p>
<p>Oh, you can get the job done.</p>
<p>Play and have fun.</p>
<p>What will you design today at Canva.com?</p>
<p>Give it up for Roger in the creative team!</p>
<p>Thanks for that epic rap Roger.</p>
<p>So today as I mentioned before, we are seeing another monumental shift</p>
<p>in technology, the emergence of artificial intelligence, a.k.a, A.I.</p>
<p>is rapidly and fundamentally changing the way we work.</p>
<p>But we know not everyone wakes up in the morning wanting to use buzzwords</p>
<p>like AI.</p>
<p>They wake up having a problem to solve or a job to be done.</p>
<p>So, as with all these shifts in technology, our team has been hard</p>
<p>at work doing what we do best,</p>
<p>and that is taking the latest and greatest technology</p>
<p>and integrating them into one simple to use platform</p>
<p>and making it accessible to the entire world.</p>
<p>And that is why we call A.I. magic.</p>
<p>And we are excited to say that today all of this magic will be available.</p>
<p>We are not launching hype reels.</p>
<p>We are actually shipping this product to every single one of you.</p>
<p>We sure are.</p>
<p>Yeah. Round of applause,</p>
<p>absolutely. So,</p>
<p>while it&rsquo;s rather</p>
<p>obvious now that everyone should be empowered to design.</p>
<p>Looking back a decade when we were trying to get Canva off the ground,</p>
<p>that certainly was not the case. Back then</p>
<p>a design tool for non designers&ndash;</p>
<p>it sounded like an oxymoron.</p>
<p>In fact, it was pretty hard to get anyone to believe in our wild dreams.</p>
<p>We were rejected by more than 100 investors</p>
<p>across the globe for a very large variety of reasons,</p>
<p>many of whom didn&rsquo;t believe there was a market to empower anyone to design,</p>
<p>one investor said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll be participating in this round.</p>
<p>We have real concerns about how the market takes shape.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yes, it was a heartbreaking time being rejected so much. But</p>
<p>fortunately that market did take shape,</p>
<p>and it was pretty darn big, especially looking at all of you here today.</p>
<p>And just one year after launching Canva, we had over</p>
<p>1 million designs being created each and every month.</p>
<p>Fast forward a year,</p>
<p>there were being 6 million designs created every single month.</p>
<p>Now, nearly a decade later, last month saw more than 500</p>
<p>million designs created.</p>
<p>And I am very</p>
<p>pleased to say that collectively we have created more than 15 billion</p>
<p>yes, billion, with a B,</p>
<p>designs.</p>
<p>From the world&rsquo;s biggest</p>
<p>brands to the new businesses just starting out.</p>
<p>From eight year olds to eighty year olds.</p>
<p>From librarians to marketers.</p>
<p>And every profession in between.</p>
<p>As of today, Canva is now used by over 125 million people,</p>
<p>using it monthly from around the globe, 190</p>
<p>different countries in 100 different languages.</p>
<p>And can you believe since our last Create just six months ago,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve added 40 million new monthly active users,</p>
<p>which I think is a huge testament to everyone in this crowd,</p>
<p>At Canva.</p>
<p>We truly</p>
<p>believe that no matter your income,</p>
<p>no matter your experience, no matter your background, we fundamentally believe</p>
<p>that everyone, everywhere should be empowered to design.</p>
<p>So Mel,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to ask, who actually created the 15,000,000,000th design?</p>
<p>That is a really good question, actually.</p>
<p>One I was really curious about myself,</p>
<p>and it turns out some of you were too</p>
<p>our 15,000,000,000th designer is a very special person.</p>
<p>She hailed from Brazil but is in fact in the audience</p>
<p>with us today.</p>
<p>Yes, plot twist.</p>
<p>So, this person was creating</p>
<p>content for their mother&rsquo;s clothing store, which was called Tulum</p>
<p>when they unknowingly created the 15 billionth design.</p>
<p>They have been using Canva for five years now and learned about Canva</p>
<p>first at a class project.</p>
<p>What do we have here?</p>
<p>Oh, some trophies. Mm.</p>
<p>Who is this 15,000,000,000th designer?</p>
<p>Maria and Shirley, could you please stand up?</p>
<p>Can we get a</p>
<p>big round of applause for Maria and Shirley?</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>congratulations.</p>
<p>Thank you for playing such a special role on our journey.</p>
<p>When we met Maria for a tour of our office, we learned that</p>
<p>Maria&rsquo;s mum, Shirley, is actually an incredible designer herself.</p>
<p>And in fact, this jacket I&rsquo;m wearing today is from her shop in Brazil.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll share some links after so you can all</p>
<p>Gg online and make some purchases.</p>
<p>Show the support back.</p>
<p>So Maria and Shirley are just one great example</p>
<p>of the many stories behind those 15 billion designs.</p>
<p>So thank you both and thank you to all of our community</p>
<p>for creating with Canva each and every single month. Together</p>
<p>all of these 15 billion designs have enabled us to realize an even bigger,</p>
<p>even more important goal.</p>
<p>We have a simple two step plan at Canva.</p>
<p>Step one is to become one of the world&rsquo;s most valuable companies,</p>
<p>And step two and most importantly, is to do the most good we can do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And while many people view these steps sequentially, we believe</p>
<p>step one helps to fuel step two and step two helps to fuel step one.</p>
<p>And like with all crazy big goals,</p>
<p>we started by taking a small step, and that step was The 1% Pledge</p>
<p>as a company. This movement encourages companies to give away</p>
<p>1% of their time profit, product and equity.</p>
<p>So, we know a lot of companies like to take inspiration from Canva</p>
<p>and might even be watching right now.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s one thing I would love other companies to copy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s joining the 1% Pledge.</p>
<p>So, on top of joining the 1%</p>
<p>pledge, a couple of years ago, Cliff and I announced that we pledged</p>
<p>to give away the vast majority of our shares,</p>
<p>which is 30% of Canva, to contribute to a better world,</p>
<p>because we fundamentally don&rsquo;t believe that we should live on a planet</p>
<p>where some people don&rsquo;t have enough for basic human rights.</p>
<p>Like food, education and healthcare.</p>
<p>As we started to focus more on step two, we identified the three causes</p>
<p>which we care most deeply about and areas that we think</p>
<p>we can have the most impact in.</p>
<p>And those three pillars will underpin a lifetime of work ahead of us.</p>
<p>The first is ensuring every child has access to quality</p>
<p>education. The second; empowering non-profits to do their best work.</p>
<p>And the third is striving to end extreme poverty.</p>
<p>We know that these are some very big goals</p>
<p>and we are excited and a little scared</p>
<p>standing before them about to take steps in that direction.</p>
<p>But we already have made the first few steps</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re truly humbled by the journey ahead of us. Today</p>
<p>we now enable more than 30 million teachers</p>
<p>and students to use Canva for free. From individual schools right through to</p>
<p>some of the largest districts in the world, like the L.A.</p>
<p>School District and the Department of Education in Indonesia.</p>
<p>Since 2015, we also have given away our product away for free to nonprofits.</p>
<p>From the Red Cross to the UNHCR, we are extremely proud to say</p>
<p>there are now more than 350,000 nonprofits using Canva</p>
<p>to communicate visually and deliver their goals every single day.</p>
<p>Last year, we launched our first pilot program with GiveDirectly,</p>
<p>focusing on alleviating extreme poverty in Southern Africa. Similar</p>
<p>to when we first launched Canva,</p>
<p>we know we&rsquo;re standing at the start of a very long and worthwhile journey</p>
<p>with a lot left to learn.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not alone on this journey.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly not just Cliff and I working towards this plan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even just our team here at Canva.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all of you.</p>
<p>And with 30% percent of Canva dedicated to doing the most good we can,</p>
<p>anyone who is contributing to the success of Canva in Step One&ndash;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s you, that&rsquo;s the community, that&rsquo;s our customer</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s our team&mdash;are also contributing to the success of Step Two.</p>
<p>Every time someone subscribes to Canva, every time a new T-shirt is printed,</p>
<p>every time a new signs up, team signs up, you are directly contributing</p>
<p>to both Step One and Step Two. So thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you for being a part of our community and for contributing</p>
<p>to this very crazy big goal.</p>
<p>So Mel, did you mention there&rsquo;s like 125 million</p>
<p>people waiting patiently to unwrap some gifts?</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess I did.</p>
<p>So when are we unwrapping them?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m very pleased to say that the anticipation is officially over.</p>
<p>Everybody, please</p>
<p>welcome our co-founder, Cameron Adams, to the stage.</p>
<p>We are at</p>
<p>a pivotal time in history where the combination of mind</p>
<p>blowing technology and the power of visual communication are converging</p>
<p>to unlock new design superpowers that were once way out of reach</p>
<p>for most people.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence has rapidly changed the conversations</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re having about the astounding power of technology,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve all discovered that it has better flow than a lot of rappers</p>
<p>we know, apart from Roger Coles.</p>
<p>Fortunately for us, AI is something we have invested in</p>
<p>for a long time.</p>
<p>Science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke once said that any sufficiently advanced</p>
<p>technology is indistinguishable from magic.</p>
<p>And at Canva, we have always taken this to heart.</p>
<p>We see technology as an invaluable tool for creating experiences</p>
<p>that seem like magic.</p>
<p>And from our very first day, we have conjured that magic</p>
<p>to make visual communication easier and more magical for people</p>
<p>all over the globe.</p>
<p>Many of our most popular features over the last few years,</p>
<p>like Background Remover and Magic Recommendations,</p>
<p>have all been made possible thanks to A.I.,</p>
<p>Folks are turning to</p>
<p>AI enabled Magic as a powerful co-creator,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve been re-imagining the entire design process</p>
<p>with this in mind.</p>
<p>We have seen these new technologies open up doors to even more creativity,</p>
<p>delivered with quality and speed that keeps pace with your ideas.</p>
<p>So today we are here to unveil</p>
<p>what this new era of AI powered design looks like</p>
<p>Canva-style.</p>
<p>We are infusing our visual suite with even more magic.</p>
<p>We have a smorgasbord</p>
<p>of magical gifts to share with each and every one of you today.</p>
<p>So, what do you say?</p>
<p>Should we really find out what is inside</p>
<p>these mysterious gifts?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, here to open our very first present,</p>
<p>please welcome from our Content Discovery Product Team, Ivy!</p>
<p>Thanks, Cam.</p>
<p>Hey, everyone.</p>
<p>Welcome to where the magic happens.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all here because we love design, creativity and content, right?</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s the one part of the process</p>
<p>we like the least?</p>
<p>The dreaded blank page.</p>
<p>Design always</p>
<p>begins with you, the creator, but we know that the first step</p>
<p>of getting started can feel really overwhelming.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve been busy working on some new tools to smooth the way</p>
<p>and get you from the first from the blank page to a finished design</p>
<p>faster than ever before.</p>
<p>Canva already offers more than 3 million professionally designed templates</p>
<p>that make design easy, but we&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>striving to make things simpler.</p>
<p>And inside this first gift is a very exciting design</p>
<p>launch that&rsquo;s going to help us do just that.</p>
<p>Shall we unwrap it and see</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s inside?</p>
<p>Can I get</p>
<p>a drum roll, please?</p>
<p>Introducing Magic Design.</p>
<p>Magic Design is a personal design companion</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s with you from the very start of your creative journey.</p>
<p>Instead of spending hours trying to find the perfect template,</p>
<p>imagine if all you needed was an image or a video,</p>
<p>and with the click of a button, you can be served beautiful designs</p>
<p>that seamlessly integrate with your content.</p>
<p>Or better yet, what if you could describe any design</p>
<p>you desire and have it created in seconds?</p>
<p>To see it in action,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to need some help representing our Product Marketing Managers,</p>
<p>everybody please welcome Anna!</p>
<p>Hi Ivy! Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>Anna you launched some exciting new print offerings last year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>For mugs, posters, business cards, store brochures, we announce you can design</p>
<p>and print products directly through Canva and get them all delivered for free.</p>
<p>Plus, with every order placed, we plant a tree from the Philippines to Africa.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 6 million trees across over 4500 hectares</p>
<p>in more than 20 reforestation sites around the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing, Anna.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m excited to say that today</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re infusing even more magic into the print experience.</p>
<p>Oh, tell me more, Ivy.</p>
<p>I want to just tell you,</p>
<p>let me show you bigger print products.</p>
<p>Any print products.</p>
<p>Shall we try it out on a flier for a new product promotion?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a photo of the product right here,</p>
<p>Could Magic design help?</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>Simply upload your image or video.</p>
<p>And Magic Design uses AI technology to create</p>
<p>the most relevant and well-suited designs.</p>
<p>From here you can select any style or color palette and apply</p>
<p>to your magic design and find an aesthetic that complements your brand.</p>
<p>And presto, you&rsquo;ve got eight</p>
<p>beautifully designed options to choose from.</p>
<p>Spoiled for choice.</p>
<p>What an effortless way to kickstart the design journey.</p>
<p>Magic Design whips up a curated selection of personalized templates</p>
<p>so you spend less time searching for the right design</p>
<p>and more time perfecting it to suit your needs.</p>
<p>I can imagine this have worked beautifully for social posts too.</p>
<p>Sure does.</p>
<p>In fact, let&rsquo;s sprinkle</p>
<p>a bit of that magic into presentations</p>
<p>so that you never have to stare at an empty slide again.</p>
<p>Madre m√≠a! Qu√© pasada!</p>
<p>Did I hear no more empty slides?</p>
<p>Tell us more, Ivy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to leave you to it.</p>
<p>Round of applause for Anna everybody.</p>
<p>And please welcome from our presentation team Pol and</p>
<p>Ashley.</p>
<p>Okay,</p>
<p>brace yourselves.</p>
<p>Our next gift is</p>
<p>Magic Presentation.</p>
<p>Magic Presentation</p>
<p>allows anyone to create engaging and rich presentations about any topic</p>
<p>with relevant and inspiring content already baked in</p>
<p>for guests spending hours on the next deck for that important meeting.</p>
<p>Magic presentation can help nail your first draft in seconds.</p>
<p>So good Ivy. Can we try it?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Pol, Ashley, think of any presentation you want to create from scratch.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>How about a 12 page</p>
<p>presentation on the history</p>
<p>of the color orange and fashion?</p>
<p>An inspired choice.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Look at that.</p>
<p>This technology will suggest suitable structure and content,</p>
<p>including images, quotes, and even icebreakers.</p>
<p>Magic Presentation does all the upfront work so you can focus on</p>
<p>adding the important details and your own unique touches.</p>
<p>And you think it can tackle any topic?</p>
<p>Any topic.</p>
<p>A presentation on the latest digital marketing trends for Gen Z?</p>
<p>How about one about this super cute yet super dangerous wildlife in Australia?</p>
<p>Oh. Oh! I have one.</p>
<p>How about one to convince your teammate to stop dressing like you.</p>
<p>See no matter the topic,</p>
<p>Magic Presentation jumpstarts the creative process,</p>
<p>so you never need to stare</p>
<p>at a blank page again.</p>
<p>But what if you&rsquo;re already well into your design journey</p>
<p>and the pieces just aren&rsquo;t quite fitting together?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fret. We&rsquo;ve thought of that too.</p>
<p>To tell us more, I&rsquo;m going to need someone from our engineering team.</p>
<p>Michelle, come on out.</p>
<p>Hey, Pol and Ashley.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got just the thing to make sure your presentations always look</p>
<p>put together.</p>
<p>We love a makeover. Yeah,</p>
<p>what have you got for us?</p>
<p>Well, you know that feeling when you&rsquo;ve been deep</p>
<p>into creating a presentation document or website</p>
<p>and no matter how long you spend moving things around and trying different</p>
<p>images, colors and fonts, you still can&rsquo;t get it to look right?</p>
<p>We sure do.</p>
<p>Well, styles and layouts are</p>
<p>waiting in the wings whenever your work needs a glow up.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how they work in presentations.</p>
<p>Have you two got something we could use?</p>
<p>Yes, we do.</p>
<p>What about a pitch for</p>
<p>&lsquo;Kudos your co-worker&rsquo; Day?</p>
<p>Kudos on your awesome idea, Ash!</p>
<p>Now all the content is there, but it is looking a little mismatched and cluttered.</p>
<p>Right? An easy fix.</p>
<p>So first things first,</p>
<p>we need a consistent esthetic that pulls everything together.</p>
<p>Lucky for us, we can just use styles to quickly and easily</p>
<p>find the perfect look and apply it across any presentation in just one click.</p>
<p>We can also apply a color palette from any image within our design,</p>
<p>or we can copy a style from a recent design</p>
<p>to keep the same look and feel across our projects.</p>
<p>This looks much more cohesive, but it&rsquo;s still a little busy.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think? We can fix that.</p>
<p>Simply choose from layout suggestions based on your current content.</p>
<p>This way all the spacing and formatting look just right.</p>
<p>You can go slide by slide and choose what layout works best for each.</p>
<p>How good,</p>
<p>I can already see this looking across lots of designs.</p>
<p>Exactly. This is perfect for social posts,</p>
<p>mobile first presentations, websites, all the things.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t wait to see</p>
<p>all the flawless design makeovers you can rollout with styles and layouts.</p>
<p>Thanks, Michelle.</p>
<p>Should we go put the finishing touches on this presentation?</p>
<p>Great idea, Ashley.</p>
<p>And timed perfectly because that next gift needs to be unwrapped.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll give you all a clue.</p>
<p>This one&rsquo;s handmade.</p>
<p>To tell us more, please welcome from our Whiteboards team,</p>
<p>Diane and Kevin.</p>
<p>Thanks, Michelle.</p>
<p>I think we can all agree that adding a personal touch</p>
<p>to your ideas is what sets them apart.</p>
<p>This next gift can help you do just that.</p>
<p>It really compliments many of our design</p>
<p>types, but none better, than Whiteboards.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, Diane.</p>
<p>Last year, we launched the ultimate team brainstorming tool,</p>
<p>just like a real life whiteboard, Canva Whiteboards</p>
<p>are made for people to simply jump in and share their ideas.</p>
<p>Since the launch back in September, Whiteboards have been used</p>
<p>145 million times.</p>
<p>No way!</p>
<p>Well, in</p>
<p>that case, Kevin, I can&rsquo;t wait for you to see what&rsquo;s inside this gift.</p>
<p>Any guesses? Hmm?</p>
<p>Can we get another clue? Of course.</p>
<p>And who better to give it than the young visionary who inspired the launch</p>
<p>of Whiteboards last year with his dad, Canva&rsquo;s head of design, Andrew Green.</p>
<p>Everybody, please welcome, reporting live from grade six,</p>
<p>Lenny Green. Ooh.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, tens of thousands of years ago, in fact,</p>
<p>the earliest known drawings made on the walls of caves in</p>
<p>France, Spain and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Us kids have come a long way since then.</p>
<p>Over centuries we&rsquo;ve invented the mighty pen,</p>
<p>paint, pixels and other epic tools like Canva.</p>
<p>But despite all the tech at our fingertips,</p>
<p>that human instinct to draw, is timeless, let alone lots of fun.</p>
<p>We love making lines, circles, squares and scribbles.</p>
<p>Feel free to</p>
<p>explore, express, and flex outside the box.</p>
<p>So the</p>
<p>community and me, made our wish loud and clear for</p>
<p>all the clever engineers do hear.</p>
<p>We wanted to draw. We want to draw.</p>
<p>We want to draw.</p>
<p>Well, our future leaders have spoken.</p>
<p>Thanks, Lenny and Andrew.</p>
<p>Well, it is my pleasure to declare</p>
<p>that thanks to some seriously strong demand from teams,</p>
<p>individuals and schools like Lenny&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>You can now scribble and sketch in Canva</p>
<p>with Draw!</p>
<p>Draw</p>
<p>lets your ideas flow with freehand sketches because we know</p>
<p>the hardest part about any project is going from ideas to action.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re making selections from a photo shoot,</p>
<p>highlighting in a presentation or planning out</p>
<p>your next big project in a Whiteboard, Draw</p>
<p>makes it a breeze to get your thoughts in shape.</p>
<p>And go from inspiration to execution.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>
<p>Simply select the pen that you want,</p>
<p>Customize it with any color or weight to enhance your designs</p>
<p>and make your ideas pop.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t stop there.</p>
<p>Elevate your sketches with shape assist</p>
<p>to start by drawing a simple shape, like a star,</p>
<p>and shape assist will transform it into a lovely, polished one.</p>
<p>And if you need to highlight, annotate or draw attention to something,</p>
<p>Draw makes it even easier for anyone on your team to share their points of view</p>
<p>or unleash wild visions from their fingertips.</p>
<p>For those craving just a little extra sprinkle of magic,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a taste of what else is to come.</p>
<p>In the next few months, you&rsquo;ll be able to use Draw&rsquo;s, sketch</p>
<p>a graphic mode to sketch out ideas,</p>
<p>and find in your perfect graphic match from the Canva library.</p>
<p>Getting from scribbles to slick visuals has never been so magical.</p>
<p>Exactly,</p>
<p>Kevin. And we have plenty more treats like Draw waiting to be unwrapped today.</p>
<p>This next one is very special to show us their way with words,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s Ahmad, Kurt and Anna.</p>
<p>Hey, everyone.</p>
<p>Kurt, Anna, you both announced the launch of Canva Docs to the world last year,</p>
<p>a major milestone for Canva.</p>
<p>We did. The introduction of Canva Docs has given the world</p>
<p>an entirely new way to communicate visually.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a Canva Docs fan, you probably love Magic Write</p>
<p>too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s helped so many people to brainstorm fresh ideas and get.</p>
<p>To their first draft fast.</p>
<p>This is going to be fun.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a heartfelt poem</p>
<p>to thank the Canva community.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Canva community for all the amazing things you do.</p>
<p>Designs that inspire and motivate creativity that shines through.</p>
<p>Poetry in motion.</p>
<p>How about an elevator pitch for elevators?</p>
<p>Next level</p>
<p>Canva Magic Write</p>
<p>I love it. Oh, I&rsquo;ve got one.</p>
<p>How about a social media strategy for Magic Write?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>Are we doing it?</p>
<p>How much would that woodchuck chuck if a</p>
<p>Woodchuck could chuck wood?</p>
<p>Oh, my goodness.</p>
<p>Whoa. It actually has a response.</p>
<p>Can I take this home?</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t wait to see what creative things you write about.</p>
<p>From the minute it launched,</p>
<p>our community has found a vast array of fun and unique ways to use Magic</p>
<p>Write to craft their thoughts.</p>
<p>For everything from speeches to SEO friendly blog posts</p>
<p>and endless original poems,</p>
<p>Magic Write for for Docs has really taken off.</p>
<p>But you know us,</p>
<p>we couldn&rsquo;t just stop there.</p>
<p>The Magic Write team has been working super hard</p>
<p>to bring the gift of words to everything you create.</p>
<p>So from today&ndash;</p>
<p>Drum roll, please&ndash;</p>
<p>You can now access Magic Write across</p>
<p>the entire Visual Suite.</p>
<p>That means</p>
<p>Magic Write is now available when you&rsquo;re creating Docs, Whiteboards,</p>
<p>presentations, social media posts, videos, print products, and websites.</p>
<p>To help us demonstrate from our website&rsquo;s team,</p>
<p>Please welcome Mimansha!</p>
<p>Hey everyone.</p>
<p>Hey, Ahmad.</p>
<p>Hey Mimansha.</p>
<p>I hear websites has been really blowing up since you launched last year.</p>
<p>Does the team have anything that could use Magic</p>
<p>Write Wizardry?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been working on this for a new design studio.</p>
<p>Our About Us page just has a bit too much text.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m struggling to cut it down and make it concise.</p>
<p>Could we use Magic Write to summarize it?</p>
<p>We sure can.</p>
<p>Wait, what was that</p>
<p>you just clicked? Oh,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s Canva assistant.</p>
<p>Our new one click trick that unlocks</p>
<p>endless possibilities while you&rsquo;re editing.</p>
<p>Wow. In one click? Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty powerful button that provides quick access</p>
<p>to the best of Canva and connects you to our AI power tools like Magic Write,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;ll always</p>
<p>have an expert design assistant by your side.</p>
<p>So handy.</p>
<p>Okay, what else can it help me with?</p>
<p>What if you&rsquo;re stuck for words</p>
<p>trying to describe our services. Can be hard to come up with that</p>
<p>in the past, pass.</p>
<p>Could we expand this text to say more?</p>
<p>Consider it done.</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Okay, last request.</p>
<p>What about this paragraph?</p>
<p>It has a few typos and is feeling a bit bland.</p>
<p>Got anything to fix that?</p>
<p>Definitely. And this is one of my favorites.</p>
<p>You can use rewrite to fix errors,</p>
<p>create clarity, and add a splash of creativity to an otherwise rough draft.</p>
<p>And the cherry on top is that Magic Write is now available</p>
<p>across 21 languages.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to have a go.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got one more gift to open first, and this one&rsquo;s taking us global.</p>
<p>On behalf of our legendary product managers,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s welcome Mr. Worldwide himself, Michael!</p>
<p>Obrigado, Ahmad!</p>
<p>For businesses,</p>
<p>one of the biggest challenges can be rolling out assets across</p>
<p>different markets.</p>
<p>So, to help your designs bridge language barriers,</p>
<p>I am thrilled</p>
<p>to be launching</p>
<p>Translate.</p>
<p>Translate is the feature that helps</p>
<p>you communicate across borders and speak your audience&rsquo;s language.</p>
<p>So say so long, sayonara and auf wiedersehen to the time</p>
<p>consuming task of localizing every word in your designs.</p>
<p>Translate will magically transform your designs into multiple languages.</p>
<p>Kya baat hain, Michael!</p>
<p>Mazaa aa gaya!</p>
<p>Save yourself from hours of laborious translation</p>
<p>efforts with over a hundred languages to choose from.</p>
<p>Going global has never been quicker or easier.</p>
<p>Simply add text to your design,</p>
<p>choose a language,</p>
<p>watch it instantly convert</p>
<p>and tweak to perfection.</p>
<p>Arigato gozaimasu, Michael!</p>
<p>Looks like we</p>
<p>still have plenty more gifts to unwrap. Ammad,</p>
<p>Shall we see if Magic Write can draft us an intro to the next lunch?</p>
<p>I think it could handle that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s ask it to write a short,</p>
<p>fun introduction about Canva&rsquo;s new AI</p>
<p>for image creation.</p>
<p>Introducing Canva&rsquo;s</p>
<p>latest and greatest.</p>
<p>A.I. features for images that are elevated. With just a click,</p>
<p>your images will shine.</p>
<p>No need to waste your time with edits online. So go ahead and snap away,</p>
<p>Canva&rsquo;s got your back,</p>
<p>Hip hip, hooray!</p>
<p>Not bad for a first draft.</p>
<p>Sally, Ben, I think this next one&rsquo;s for you.</p>
<p>Thanks, team.</p>
<p>Hello, everybody.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Sally from our Content and Discovery team.</p>
<p>And joining me is one of the talented folks who works</p>
<p>in our visual A.I. features. All the way from our Canva offices in Vienna,</p>
<p>please welcome Ben.</p>
<p>Hello, everyone.</p>
<p>Hey, Sally.</p>
<p>Well, since launching last year, our community has been having</p>
<p>a lot of fun transforming their ideas from text to image.</p>
<p>Yes. Thanks to this fun feature,</p>
<p>finding that perfect image to fill your content calendar or</p>
<p>visualizing a quick mock up to illustrate your point is never impossible.</p>
<p>But now you can do even more with text to image and unlock</p>
<p>new corners of your imagination wherever you&rsquo;re designing.</p>
<p>You now have 19 different styles to choose from and the ability</p>
<p>to generate images in landscape, square or portrait.</p>
<p>Before the event</p>
<p>today, we asked our audience here to pluck anything from their imagination,</p>
<p>describe it to us and we&rsquo;d bring it to life right now.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get generating.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve certainly got some vivid imaginations in our audience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to narrow them down, but there are a few standouts.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one from Jessica, who&rsquo;s up from Melbourne.</p>
<p>Jess asked for a city in a beautiful galaxy surrounded by stars.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use the dreamlike style.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s dreamy.</p>
<p>Tony.</p>
<p>Tony,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s flown in from Canada, wants abstract, common geometric shapes</p>
<p>with pastel background to use as a backdrop for a product visual.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make this 3D.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s very Zen. And Cliff</p>
<p>from Perth</p>
<p>has asked for a knight</p>
<p>in shining armor walking through the water as the sun sets.</p>
<p>That sounds epic.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try filmic.</p>
<p>Oh, stunning.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who submitted suggestions</p>
<p>With text to image in Canva,</p>
<p>You really can design the way you see the world.</p>
<p>But the picture perfect developments don&rsquo;t stop there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so excited to be up here announcing the mind</p>
<p>blowing new updates to our photo editing experience.</p>
<p>Sadly, this gift will come in handy for anyone who has to keep up online.</p>
<p>Shall we give it a go on a social media post?</p>
<p>Well, Jai has been down here this whole time taking photos for social feed.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t mind me, you&rsquo;re doing great, sweeties.</p>
<p>Jai, why don&rsquo;t you come up and help me open this next gift?</p>
<p>I thought you&rsquo;d never ask.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you to it. From our social team,</p>
<p>please welcome Jai!</p>
<p>Right,</p>
<p>well, this crowd is looking sensational.</p>
<p>I think we need a little selfie with them.</p>
<p>Shall we? Of course.</p>
<p>All right, guys, get on in.</p>
<p>Ah, stunning.</p>
<p>All right, everyone,</p>
<p>back to business.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to introduce</p>
<p>Magic Edit.</p>
<p>With Magic Edit,</p>
<p>you can easily add or replace something in a photo.</p>
<p>Just describe what you want</p>
<p>And what should magically appear.</p>
<p>This sounds phenomenal, but to believe it, I am going to need to see it in action.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it. Have you got a photo that could do of some editing?</p>
<p>Ah, so many.</p>
<p>Oh, no, not that one, that&rsquo;s perfect. Next one. All right.</p>
<p>We see these flowers down the bottom there giving Valentine&rsquo;s, February&ndash;</p>
<p>Can we change that to something with a bit more of a sunny disposition?</p>
<p>Oh, done.</p>
<p>Phenomenal.</p>
<p>All right, well,</p>
<p>whilst I&rsquo;m up here, can I be cheeky and ask for another set of edits?</p>
<p>Of course. Go for it. All right, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>All right. This picture over here is stunning,</p>
<p>but the birds in the top corner, they&rsquo;re feeling a little bit distracting.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s replace those, get them out the way, and let&rsquo;s get a nice headline up there.</p>
<p>Yeah, no problem.</p>
<p>With Magic Eraser, you can automatically remove unwanted distractions.</p>
<p>You simply brush over the area and</p>
<p>bye bye, birdies.</p>
<p>Phenomenal.</p>
<p>For those of us who work in social media who have to make content</p>
<p>daily, often hourly, anything that elevates</p>
<p>our creativity and saves us a little bit of time.</p>
<p>Absolute godsend.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<p>With these new photo editing tools,</p>
<p>you can add magic to your photos across the visual suite. Right,</p>
<p>well, Ben, you&rsquo;ve been so generous.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to take an assumption</p>
<p>that the rest of these presents are also for me. Right?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ll certainly enjoy these.</p>
<p>Yes, but they are from Canva Video to hand them out from our video team,</p>
<p>please welcome Joe and Matt.</p>
<p>Hey, everyone,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s jump into this next present, creating a high quality video</p>
<p>has historically been really complex, costly, and time consuming.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been working really hard on making Canva video</p>
<p>the simplest and most enjoyable video editing tool there is.</p>
<p>Our community love video so much they&rsquo;ve made over one and a half billion to date.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;ve got some groundbreaking developments to animations</p>
<p>coming your way. Now, what&rsquo;s up with the&hellip;?</p>
<p>Well, Joe, I&rsquo;ve got to be careful with this one, because what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>unwrapping next is un-bee-lievable.</p>
<p>I am delighted to introduce</p>
<p>Create an Animation.</p>
<p>And just like that little fella, we&rsquo;ve been busy</p>
<p>bees adding even more magic to Canva Video.</p>
<p>As of today, you can create an animation right here in the editor, giving you</p>
<p>even more ways to craft your story with motion or make your point clear.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve got this cute element here,</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;ve got an easy way to create custom animations within my design.</p>
<p>All you need to do is draw. Simply drag your element</p>
<p>across the screen to record the path you want your animation to follow.</p>
<p>You can speed up</p>
<p>or slow down the animation by changing the pace of your movements</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re recording.</p>
<p>Ta-da! Oh my God, that&rsquo;s so cool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m buzzing with excitement.</p>
<p>Sure Jo, me too!</p>
<p>You can use in all kinds of ways to tell all kinds of stories.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can take your audience on a journey to faraway lands</p>
<p>with elements that travel around the page.</p>
<p>Or create something truly out of this world</p>
<p>by sending your elements into orbit.</p>
<p>It is so awesome to see the power of animation coming to Canva.</p>
<p>Matt, You better go track down that rogue bee.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give it up for Matt and Create an Animation.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;ve got one more surprise up our sleeve</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to rock your world.</p>
<p>Wrapping our video engineers,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s Julia.</p>
<p>Hey. Hey.</p>
<p>I have an announcement. I can&rsquo;t hear you.</p>
<p>What did you say?</p>
<p>An announcement!</p>
<p>Can we turn it down?</p>
<p>Oh, thanks.</p>
<p>Now, when it</p>
<p>comes to making captivating videos,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s one of the most important ingredients to get right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got to be the music. That&rsquo;s right, Jo.</p>
<p>The music is the heartbeat to any great piece of content.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I am so excited to introduce&ndash;</p>
<p>Can I get a drum</p>
<p>roll?</p>
<p>Beat Sync.</p>
<p>Whether you want to</p>
<p>upload your own track or choose from our library</p>
<p>Beat Sync finds the beats for you.</p>
<p>Now, typically you need to spend a ton of time</p>
<p>manually editing your content to line up with the music</p>
<p>bouncing back and forth between your footage and audio,</p>
<p>trying to get it just right. But not any more.</p>
<p>In just one click, Beat Sync will match your video</p>
<p>footage to your soundtrack automatically.</p>
<p>Hit it, Jo. [music]</p>
<p>[music]</p>
<p>[music]</p>
<p>[music]</p>
<p>Holy, booming beats Batman.</p>
<p>Canva Video just took it to a whole new level.</p>
<p>That epic announcement</p>
<p>just about wraps up our A.I. powered launches.</p>
<p>We have introduced you to Magic Design,</p>
<p>Magic Presentations, Styles and Layouts Draw, Magic Write, Canva Assistant,</p>
<p>Translate, Text to Image, Magic Edit, Magic Eraser, Create an Animation and Beat Sync.</p>
<p>And that is so much that I just ran out of breath</p>
<p>by weaving all this magic across the Visual Suite.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not only supercharging a way you communicate,</p>
<p>we are inviting you to create this brand new era with us.</p>
<p>So, with the infusion of all this magic, let&rsquo;s take a look at our Visual Suite</p>
<p>Now!</p>
<p>Thank you to all our onstage magic</p>
<p>Makers.</p>
<p>Now the first part of producing effective content at scale</p>
<p>is making sure absolutely everyone in your team has the magical tools</p>
<p>they need to avoid hitting any creative bottlenecks.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a second part to creating impactful visual content;</p>
<p>making sure that everyone can not just design</p>
<p>but design on brand.</p>
<p>Which brings us to our very last gift. Here to tell us a bit</p>
<p>more about that one, please welcome Canva&rsquo;s CMO Zach</p>
<p>Kitschke! Thank you, Cam.</p>
<p>Hi everyone.</p>
<p>Wow, I&rsquo;m really excited to be up here</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re celebrating the 10th year of Canva! It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard to fathom how much has changed. In just the beginning</p>
<p>there were a handful of us</p>
<p>gearing up to launch a brand and a product that no one had heard of.</p>
<p>And and here we are today.</p>
<p>While our team no longer</p>
<p>has to fight over the single bathroom or meeting room,</p>
<p>or that last Tim Tam,</p>
<p>some things are still the same.</p>
<p>Building a brand, whether you&rsquo;re a startup or a Fortune</p>
<p>500 is hard.</p>
<p>Finding that next customer, creating a social post, or email</p>
<p>that delights, or even putting on an event like this takes blood,</p>
<p>sweat and tears.</p>
<p>Actually, can I get a round of applause for the incredible team</p>
<p>behind today?</p>
<p>As marketers and creatives, we care deeply about our communities.</p>
<p>We care about brand&rsquo;s values</p>
<p>and we care about driving impact.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just as hard these days.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually gotten harder. For one, the sheer demand</p>
<p>for content and engagement has accelerated at an exponential rate.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got more people in our organizations needing to create and communicate,</p>
<p>and our creative teams are more stretched than ever before.</p>
<p>And while the technology is there, we&rsquo;re still stuck</p>
<p>with old school approaches to managing brands and scaling content.</p>
<p>Now, one of the greatest privileges of my job is connecting</p>
<p>with incredible marketers, creatives and brands.</p>
<p>And one thing we keep hearing is how everyone is facing the same challenge</p>
<p>maintaining brand craft at scale.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>
<p>Brands are in crisis.</p>
<p>78% of brands could disappear</p>
<p>while we&rsquo;re on this call, Zach, and nobody would notice or care.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me, I&rsquo;m Jennifer Halloran.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jolene Delisle.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Seth Matlins.</p>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m John Costello, and thanks for having me.</p>
<p>What would you say is the importance of visual communication these days,</p>
<p>Seth, and how has that changed?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think visual communication has ever in the history of history</p>
<p>Been more important than it is today.</p>
<p>We used to say that, you know, a picture is worth a thousand words, but that was</p>
<p>before social media, Instagram, before more pictures were being taken today</p>
<p>than they were throughout the rest of recorded history.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re seeing this explosion</p>
<p>in social platforms and decentralization of media.</p>
<p>What have been</p>
<p>some of those pressures in your words? The explosion of content</p>
<p>and social media has been a mixed blessing.</p>
<p>Everybody wants you to know them, speak to them.</p>
<p>And that makes it really hard to do what marketers do.</p>
<p>Our clients are posting six or seven times</p>
<p>a day versus, you know, six or seven times a month, which they were doing before.</p>
<p>And across multiple platforms too.</p>
<p>You can be all over the place really fast.</p>
<p>You start becoming</p>
<p>nothing to anyone as opposed to trying to be something for everyone.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen because of this explosion,</p>
<p>a fundamental shift in human behavior. Right?</p>
<p>We all scroll like this.</p>
<p>The default is ignored.</p>
<p>How do you think the importance of branding has changed?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re more engaged with brands than we ever were before.</p>
<p>If a brand is doing the right thing, then they should never be ignored.</p>
<p>They should be part of that conversation.</p>
<p>What job do you think</p>
<p>brand guidelines need to do today?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all part of building or in fact, tearing down the brand.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s marketing channels shift so quickly.</p>
<p>We found that when we create a company&rsquo;s brand,</p>
<p>giving them guidelines could only do so much.</p>
<p>So really, I think the guidelines</p>
<p>you have to act as an enabler and not necessarily always an enforcer.</p>
<p>Give them the basics and let people get in there and play with it themselves.</p>
<p>You know, today anybody with a keyboard can influence the destiny of a brand.</p>
<p>in a moment.</p>
<p>So I think it puts a real premium on finding a real type</p>
<p>answer to the question;</p>
<p>Why should I choose your brand over all</p>
<p>my other choices?</p>
<p>Definitely given us a lot to think about.</p>
<p>Thank you all so much for joining.</p>
<p>There is, however, hope as we enter this brand new era.</p>
<p>The technology we have available to us has the potential</p>
<p>to solve the challenges that brands are facing.</p>
<p>We need to enable creatives to pursue their craft</p>
<p>and enable our teams to leverage visual communication at scale.</p>
<p>This is the inspiration for how we set about making Canva</p>
<p>the home for every brand.</p>
<p>Which brings us to our final gift.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big one.</p>
<p>Drum roll, please.</p>
<p>Introducing the</p>
<p>Canva Brand Hub.</p>
<p>One central place</p>
<p>to make, manage and market your brands.</p>
<p>It all starts with leveraging the expertise and power</p>
<p>of your creative teams.</p>
<p>And who better to walk us through than the person</p>
<p>who built our creative team and scaled our brand?</p>
<p>Kat van der Werff.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to give you the grand tour.</p>
<p>We want to make sure that every brand from the smallest company</p>
<p>to the largest business feels at home here in Canva.</p>
<p>So when I started at Canva five years ago,</p>
<p>I asked for the brand guidelines and I was given a logo.</p>
<p>We all know that a brand is so much more than this.</p>
<p>And so we set to work articulating what our brand stands for</p>
<p>and how we should show up in the world. With our talented</p>
<p>in-house creative team and agency partners along the way,</p>
<p>we have been evolving Canva&rsquo;s brand ever since, from just a logo</p>
<p>in to the global brand that you see here today.</p>
<p>As our company has grown into from 300 to 3000 people,</p>
<p>we have used Canva&rsquo;s tools to keep everyone aligned and on brand.</p>
<p>Our roles</p>
<p>as creatives and marketers and designers</p>
<p>are more important than ever before in this brand new era.</p>
<p>We are experts at crafting brands,</p>
<p>but deploy them effectively at scale,</p>
<p>we need to put our brands in the hands of everyone,</p>
<p>in every role and every organization.</p>
<p>They will need to be used by internal design teams as well</p>
<p>as salespeople, community managers, the finance folks.</p>
<p>People who may not know how to use complex design tools</p>
<p>but do have critical roles that require consistent brand communication.</p>
<p>So by empowering everyone</p>
<p>to stay on brand, you can rest easy</p>
<p>in the knowledge that your lovingly crafted brand will show up in the world</p>
<p>and just the way you intended.</p>
<p>Everyone is welcome here</p>
<p>so come on in.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re about to explore the brand hub,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s head into our first room.</p>
<p>So everywhere you go in the world, the kitchen is the beating heart of a home.</p>
<p>And of course, quality ingredients</p>
<p>are essential for quality design.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s rustle up some visual feasts,</p>
<p>shall we, Carly?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to! Canva&rsquo;s brand kit feature brings together</p>
<p>all your brand ingredients and assets. By centralizing everything in one place,</p>
<p>you can set up, manage and grow your brand</p>
<p>consistently and scale your content seamlessly.</p>
<p>Our team loves this. Let&rsquo;s take a look at Canva&rsquo;s own Brand Kit.</p>
<p>Great idea, Cat.</p>
<p>So this is where you upload and store all your brand&rsquo;s core elements</p>
<p>so they live together for your whole team to find on demand.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s the art workers or the accountants.</p>
<p>From the logos, colors and fonts that make your brand unique</p>
<p>to the imagery, graphics and illustrations that help bring it to life,</p>
<p>Canva collates everything your teams or clients</p>
<p>need to stay on brand in one beautifully organized pantry.</p>
<p>You can even set up multiple brand kits</p>
<p>up to 300 of them for the different projects, clients,</p>
<p>brands or sub brands you are working on. You Canva</p>
<p>Brand Kit can be accessed from the Canva editor,</p>
<p>so no matter who is creating content, what device they&rsquo;re making it on,</p>
<p>or where, everything is right there to hand as they&rsquo;re designing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now easy for teams to apply approved brand ingredients</p>
<p>to their designs and create compelling branded content,</p>
<p>all from one single tab on</p>
<p>one user friendly platform.</p>
<p>There are already more than 2 million teams</p>
<p>around the world taking advantage of our brand kit.</p>
<p>Here is Zoom&rsquo;s brand creative manager</p>
<p>Brandon to share how it&rsquo;s helped them manage their brand assets globally.</p>
<p>Zoom is one of the</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s leading communication platforms.</p>
<p>We grew really, really fast and kind of</p>
<p>keeping in control of everything was a challenge for us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Brandon Realmonte, I&rsquo;m brand creative manager for Zoom.</p>
<p>My design team really sets the standards for the entire brand globally.</p>
<p>We had a lot of people that were non designers that needed to create things</p>
<p>and we didn&rsquo;t really have a tool that was effective for them to use.</p>
<p>Canva&rsquo;s really allowed us to scale globally and allow employees,</p>
<p>whether designer or non designer, to collaborate on one platform.</p>
<p>One of the most useful features for us personally is the brand kit</p>
<p>is really just allowing my team some freedom to, you know,</p>
<p>create assets that can then expand to the rest of the company.</p>
<p>Employees that weren&rsquo;t designers</p>
<p>can go and self-serve and create content that still feels on brand know</p>
<p>they can always go there and find brand elements or logos or whatever they need.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really efficient and allows us to scale easily.</p>
<p>Canva really helped in knowing whoever is designing from this,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to do a good job and it&rsquo;s going to be consistent</p>
<p>with those templates and guidelines</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve set. If I were to talk to a business leader</p>
<p>I would just let them know</p>
<p>how much time they&rsquo;re going to save by switching to Canva.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really going to allow your team at the time</p>
<p>that they need to focus on the projects that really matter.</p>
<p>Nice one, Zoom!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also got</p>
<p>another new addition to our buffet of features</p>
<p>to help your team design: Brand Guidelines.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re now able to add instructions and guidelines</p>
<p>so teams instantly understand how to use and how not to use</p>
<p>all the brand ingredients at their fingertips. So we</p>
<p>can kiss goodbye to those 100 page guidelines</p>
<p>no one ever reads.</p>
<p>And now you can easily access your living guidelines</p>
<p>right there where you need them the most. Yep.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not all. For the companies, agencies and freelancers</p>
<p>working with multiple brands that each boast their own unique flavor,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve built something extra special</p>
<p>that will make life a whole lot simpler.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to pass you to my sous chef,</p>
<p>Ash, to tell us more.</p>
<p>Thanks, Carls.</p>
<p>Hey, Cat. When you&rsquo;ve got lots of</p>
<p>cooks in the kitchen, you need a tool that keeps collaboration super simple</p>
<p>as well as allows anyone to stay on brand in absolutely any context.</p>
<p>And this is where brand photos come in.</p>
<p>Dedicated folders where you can set up unique branding templates</p>
<p>and controls for specific brand projects or teams.</p>
<p>Now, with Canva,</p>
<p>we work in different teams on multiple projects, campaigns, and events.</p>
<p>We shared templates, logos, images and elements from all over the world</p>
<p>for all 3500 of our teammates to create with.</p>
<p>Could get a little chaotic.</p>
<p>Yes it could, Cat.</p>
<p>But with folders staying organized and on brand is that simple.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got everything seamlessly stored in one accessible space for our team</p>
<p>to turn to. From brand templates</p>
<p>that help your whole organization show up just as you intended,</p>
<p>to having your brand kit handy when you need it the most.</p>
<p>Everything is saved in one centralized place to make staying on brand</p>
<p>seamless and effortless for anyone in our team.</p>
<p>Amazing,</p>
<p>we can find everything we need right away.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>Plus, photos makes collaborating that much easier.</p>
<p>Whether you want to work with your internal team, invite</p>
<p>external collaborators, or keep a project for only select individuals to see.</p>
<p>Something should be for select eyes only.</p>
<p>Agree.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ve got your brand&ndash;or brands&ndash; set up on Canva,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably wondering</p>
<p>how you can empower everyone to use them with ease and accuracy.</p>
<p>Sounds like it&rsquo;s time to head into the next room.</p>
<p>Thanks, Ash.</p>
<p>This is a really big house.</p>
<p>Hey Suganth, what&rsquo;s going on in here?</p>
<p>Hey, Cat,</p>
<p>Come on in, get comfy.</p>
<p>This is the zone</p>
<p>That allows you to sit back and relax in the knowledge that the brand</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve worked so hard</p>
<p>to craft will be safe once it flies the nest.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Because I can be a pretty protective brand Mama.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>Now you can rest easy</p>
<p>thanks to Canva&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Brand Controls.</p>
<p>Okay, everybody, be honest.</p>
<p>Have you ever handed over your designs only to have the execution</p>
<p>look nothing like your on brand vision?</p>
<p>Or, are you in fact, that person that goes crazy with clashing colors or comic sans?</p>
<p>Whichever side of the fence you&rsquo;re on,</p>
<p>Canva can help all of you by supplying everyone</p>
<p>with just the input they need and the right level of oversight.</p>
<p>Firstly, we are</p>
<p>giving you the power to control what your team can see</p>
<p>and access in terms of colors, fonts, templates and assets.</p>
<p>That will save people from feeling overwhelmed or being tempted to go a</p>
<p>Little wild.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And secondly, you can also add approval workflows</p>
<p>so that your creative team can review and provide</p>
<p>feedback on the designs before they go into the world.</p>
<p>Oh phew. Yes, this keeps things moving across your team,</p>
<p>but without the risk of dodgy designs slipping through the cracks.</p>
<p>What a relief.</p>
<p>Thank you, Suganth.</p>
<p>So since the beginning of Canva, one of the biggest</p>
<p>things that has drawn people to our platforms is our templates.</p>
<p>And while our team has been very busy designing templates</p>
<p>for everyone else in the world, we realized</p>
<p>that our own internal departments needed a little bit of a hand, too,</p>
<p>with their presentations and docs and posts to keep them on brand.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s head into the next room to see what the solution is.</p>
<p>Hey there, Mike. Where are we now?</p>
<p>Welcome to your very own home office where you&rsquo;ll find all your go to templates,</p>
<p>gadgets and tech that make your brand home seamless, smart and interconnected.</p>
<p>This sounds wonderful.</p>
<p>You know,</p>
<p>it is pretty cool.</p>
<p>For instance, if folks in your team are regularly creating similar designs,</p>
<p>you can save heaps of time by setting them up with brand templates.</p>
<p>Take Expedia, for example.</p>
<p>Expedia turned to Canva looking for a way to deploy</p>
<p>their brand to staff across the organization.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re able to create custom templates in Canada, which made it quick</p>
<p>and easy for their entire team to effortlessly design on brand content.</p>
<p>Or, you can import your existing files like Reddit.</p>
<p>When Reddit faced the challenge of rolling out brand consistency</p>
<p>globally, they used one of my favorite features.</p>
<p>They were able to import</p>
<p>all of their brand assets and create branded templates, empowering</p>
<p>everyone across their organization to create and update content</p>
<p>without needing a professional designer every time.</p>
<p>So instead of having to wait or beg for a designer to make</p>
<p>those tiny tweaks like updating some copy</p>
<p>changes can be made by anyone.</p>
<p>That means us designers and creatives can keep on crafting</p>
<p>brands wherever we feel most comfortable, and</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re ready to scale, then we can come to Canva.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve made it easy to import existing files</p>
<p>from other platforms. From Word or Google Docs to those presentations</p>
<p>your company has been using forever. Even your Photoshop files.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget my personal favorite.</p>
<p>Of course, the most exciting of all imports is PDFs,</p>
<p>which you can finally edit with ease.</p>
<p>Those previously locked up files have been freed and given new life in Canva.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also snuck in another shortcut</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to love. Canva&rsquo;s new template assistant.</p>
<p>It checks the quality of your template designs and highlights</p>
<p>potential issues so you can easily spot and correct them.</p>
<p>It saves so much time manually checking for errors</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t miss anything before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>Genius.</p>
<p>Plus, to really make the whole content creation process seamless from end to end,</p>
<p>Canva connects with your other most trusted workplace</p>
<p>tools too. If you use tools like Google Drive or SharePoint to house your content</p>
<p>or digital asset management system like Acquia by Widen or Brandfolder,</p>
<p>you can link them directly with Canva to make designing with all your media easy.</p>
<p>You can also integrate with the communication tools you use every day</p>
<p>like Slack or Microsoft Teams so that your Canva notifications</p>
<p>pop up directly wherever you&rsquo;re working. Every step of your creative journey</p>
<p>has truly been supercharged for maximum agility.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s a powerful thing.</p>
<p>Thanks much.</p>
<p>Speaking of&ndash; where in the</p>
<p>house do you keep your most powerful tools? In</p>
<p>the garage</p>
<p>of course.</p>
<p>Hey. Hey, Flick.</p>
<p>Flick, what&rsquo;s going on? Hi, everyone,</p>
<p>welcome to the garage!</p>
<p>This place is</p>
<p>full of handy tools to make designing even speedier,</p>
<p>like Magic Resize and Bulk Create Magic</p>
<p>Resize is already a firm Canva favorite.</p>
<p>Saves teams countless hours by instantly</p>
<p>resizing one design into multiple formats.</p>
<p>Our team uses this feature all the time for our campaign rollouts.</p>
<p>We just designed something once and then resize</p>
<p>it for every platform with the click. So good!</p>
<p>Whereas Bulk Create makes multiple versions</p>
<p>of the same design that only requires small tweaks</p>
<p>like different names, numbers or images, and it applies them to each design.</p>
<p>I use it to create my personalized invites to my annual garage sale.</p>
<p>And I recently used it to make business cards for</p>
<p>my whole team in seconds.</p>
<p>Uh Flick, is that</p>
<p>logo out of date?</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s awkward.</p>
<p>Luckily, I&rsquo;ve got something in here</p>
<p>That can solve that.</p>
<p>Gone are the days of a brand update being an agonizing affair</p>
<p>or the shame of seeing your 2007 logo</p>
<p>pop up in the CEO&rsquo;s presentation. From today,</p>
<p>with Canva, you can now magically</p>
<p>replace your outdated logos and brand imagery</p>
<p>across all your designs in just a few clicks.</p>
<p>You no longer have to go searching through thousands of docs</p>
<p>and decks and designs to find that elusive logo old photo.</p>
<p>This makes it easy to ensure your brand</p>
<p>always reflects your current identity.</p>
<p>Nailed it!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Flick.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;ve got an</p>
<p>effortless way to control how our brand shows up in the world.</p>
<p>All we need now is a&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh! Who could that be?</p>
<p>Oh, hi, Nicola. Come on in.</p>
<p>What have you got there?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a few special bonus gifs.</p>
<p>I thought these ones deserved to be delivered in person.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been on our community wish list for a while now.</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>Do you want do the honors?</p>
<p>I would love to.</p>
<p>Oh, what could this be?</p>
<p>As requested by Rachel, we now have</p>
<p>Grids!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to report that you&rsquo;ve got a helping hand</p>
<p>next time you&rsquo;re designing. Simply add layout guides to ensure</p>
<p>all elements are aligned, consistent, and in the right place.</p>
<p>You can choose from preset layout guides</p>
<p>or create your own customized ones to get the look you want.</p>
<p>Shall we open another one?</p>
<p>Yes. Let&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>All righty.</p>
<p>This one is for you, Aref.</p>
<p>One of the many people asking for</p>
<p>gradients!</p>
<p>It sure is a game changer, Aref.</p>
<p>You can now add a sweep of magic to any design by applying a gradient</p>
<p>to your background or shapes. Choose from pre-made gradients</p>
<p>or customize one to your style or colors.</p>
<p>Shall we open another one? Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>All righty.</p>
<p>Here is what you have been waiting for,</p>
<p>Rochelle.</p>
<p>Layers are here!</p>
<p>Ask and you shall receive.</p>
<p>Canva makes it easy to view, manage and arrange all the layers in your design</p>
<p>in one place.</p>
<p>It gives you the ultimate overview of which elements are locked, grouped,</p>
<p>or set as the background image we hope the community loves&ndash;</p>
<p>Nichola Sorry, I just.</p>
<p>I actually have a personal request.</p>
<p>Okay, thank you.</p>
<p>Just one last one.</p>
<p>I love all of Canva&rsquo;s fonts,</p>
<p>but can I please have even more?</p>
<p>Well, okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to reveal that from today</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve partnered with one of the world&rsquo;s premier font foundries;</p>
<p>Monotype! Yes,</p>
<p>that is my type of announcement.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>This partnership will give our community more creative</p>
<p>freedom to design beautifully and craft their stories.</p>
<p>There are now over a thousand curated fonts from Monotype available in Canva.</p>
<p>With this expansive collection, you can evoke emotions, play</p>
<p>with the classics, and take your message global all while staying on brand.</p>
<p>With Canva, it&rsquo;s now even easier to discover options</p>
<p>that suit your style and help you find exactly what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>I cannot wait to play around with all these new fonts.</p>
<p>Big round of applause for Nichola.</p>
<p>It is so rewarding</p>
<p>to see what our community inspires our team to create.</p>
<p>So if there is anything else you would like to see added to Canva&rsquo;s</p>
<p>toolbox, let us know.</p>
<p>We hope you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>enjoy taking a tour of your brand new brand home.</p>
<p>As we all know, a home is so much more than the fittings</p>
<p>and the furniture and brands are the same.</p>
<p>True brands have meanings well beyond the logos, the fonts, and the colors.</p>
<p>Your brand represents what you stand for.</p>
<p>It is your chance to tell your story, to share your values,</p>
<p>to grow your community, and importantly, to make people feel something.</p>
<p>Offering teams everywhere everything they need to be their brand&rsquo;s</p>
<p>greatest custodians or housekeepers</p>
<p>is part of Canva&rsquo;s mission to empower the whole world to design.</p>
<p>We are so happy you have arrived.</p>
<p>Welcome home.</p>
<p>[clapping]</p>
<p>What a section! How good was that?</p>
<p>No surprise.</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s someone behind the door.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s our fearless leader.</p>
<p>Welcome.</p>
<p>Come in.</p>
<p>Well, that is nearly</p>
<p>a wrap on our second Canva Create</p>
<p>and what a day it has been.</p>
<p>We are so</p>
<p>incredibly excited for all 125 million people</p>
<p>around the world to start unwrapping these incredible gifts today.</p>
<p>We have unveiled a lot today.</p>
<p>We started with some of the many</p>
<p>ways we&rsquo;re using A.I.</p>
<p>to supercharge our entire visual suite with so many magical new features.</p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;ve just seen, we have handed over the keys</p>
<p>to the home for every brand.</p>
<p>As we double down on empowering marketers, creatives and agencies</p>
<p>to accelerate their craft and scale visual content in organizations</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;ve never seen before with the Brand Hub.</p>
<p>It has been an absolutely jam packed day.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a quick look back at everything we have unwrapped</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>as we spoke about before, this isn&rsquo;t some hype reel.</p>
<p>We are launching all of this today!</p>
<p>We often say that we are</p>
<p>only 1% of the way there,</p>
<p>and as we continue to dream ever bigger dreams and set ever</p>
<p>bigger goals, that could be not be more true than it is today.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>A decade into this journey.</p>
<p>2023 marks a very special year for Canva.</p>
<p>In celebration of our 10th birthday, we&rsquo;ll be hitting the road</p>

<p>Developers Conference in San Francisco this June.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have more to share on this very shortly.</p>
<p>We actually have a</p>
<p>tradition at Canva of giving kudos to each other</p>
<p>when people do great work, and it&rsquo;s safe to say that the kudos</p>
<p>have absolutely been on fire over the last few months.</p>
<p>Mel said it earlier, but it really does take a small city</p>
<p>to bring all of this magic to life.</p>
<p>From our product and engineering teams who are making and launching magic for</p>
<p>millions of people all around the world to our marketing teams</p>
<p>and our creative teams that are behind this amazing jam packed event.</p>
<p>And to our people and operations teams who have been making every office</p>
<p>event and experience truly memorable for our team and our community.</p>
<p>We truly have the world&rsquo;s best team.</p>
<p>So thank you to all the Canvanauts</p>
<p>around the world who worked tirelessly to bring all of this magic to life</p>
<p>and who care passionately about building experiences for our community,</p>
<p>our customers, and make Canva one of the best companies in the world.</p>
<p>A lot of heart and hard work has gone into everything</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve seen on stage today</p>
<p>and so I would love everyone who works at Canva to please stand up.</p>
<p>Then up for each and every one of you stand up.</p>
<p>And I would like you to take, once you&rsquo;re up,</p>
<p>I would like you to take the biggest bow or curtsy that the world has ever seen,</p>
<p>because this stage is yours. Go on.</p>
<p>Congratulations everyone, [clapping].</p>
<p>Take your bow.</p>
<p>Bow everyone.</p>
<p>Bow</p>
<p>Congrats to you all.</p>
<p>I actually mean it.</p>
<p>I actually made it. I want you to take a bow on the</p>
<p>count of three.</p>
<p>Three, two, one, everyone, take a bow.</p>
<p>Well done. Congratulations,</p>
<p>you may take a seat.</p>
<p>And of course, to all our team tuning in online</p>
<p>from all around the world, give us an emoji on the stream.</p>
<p>Thank you for all of your extraordinary hard work.</p>
<p>And thank you for all the magic you make every single day.</p>
<p>While that is nearly a wrap, we do have one less one important thing left to do.</p>
<p>Please give a final warm welcome to someone who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been integral to so much of the innovation you&rsquo;ve seen here on stage</p>
<p>one of our leading magic makers, Danny.</p>
