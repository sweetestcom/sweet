    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Hi friends, this week I&rsquo;m going to tell you all the voids money can&rsquo;t fill.</p>
<p>And the reason I really want to make this is because I&rsquo;ve touched a lot of money, multiple</p>
<p>times now in my life.</p>
<p>And there are certain heartbreaks that came with it that I want to prevent you from.</p>
<p>Because I had so many ideas of what life would be like once I got money, everything would</p>
<p>be fixed.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of voids money can&rsquo;t fill and there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of problems</p>
<p>money can&rsquo;t solve.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re the most painful ones.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also going to dive into how when you get money, the pain gets worse of the</p>
<p>shit that it can&rsquo;t touch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to cover a ton in this episode.</p>
<p>But before we jump into it, I want to say I&rsquo;m bringing back what would Leo do?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a segment I did on my podcast a few months back where you guys would write in</p>
<p>and tell me your situation and ask for advice basically about what you&rsquo;re going through.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not going to bring it back in every episode how I was doing it before.</p>
<p>Like I would take like three scenarios and thrown in at the end of every podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start doing one episode a month.</p>
<p>That is a full episode of what would Leo do?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to leave a link in the description where you can go and submit your situation</p>
<p>and what you want advice on.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m just going to pull from there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be completely anonymous.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re free to be as explicit and as honest as you want.</p>
<p>Like give me enough details where I can give you accurate advice, but you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>worry about anything being attached to you.</p>
<p>So the link will be in the description and everyone listening on the audio version, it</p>
<p>will also be linked below where you can write in what you got to complain about and what</p>
<p>you want advice about.</p>
<p>Nothing&rsquo;s off limits.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll cover anything.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s jump into this.</p>
<p>The first void money cannot fill is the sense of purpose and every human being&rsquo;s need to</p>
<p>contribute and feel of value.</p>
<p>Feeling of use is a huge need of every human being.</p>
<p>So if you have a bunch of money, you&rsquo;re free to spend your time however you want.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re just handed a few million dollars and you&rsquo;re just able to do whatever you want</p>
<p>with your time, you&rsquo;re going to be able to do whatever the fuck you want and you&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>fun for a minute.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to go like travel and buy shit and do this and that and X, Y, Z.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t spend your time being of use to others, it&rsquo;s going to fuck with you</p>
<p>big time.</p>
<p>Trust me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all fun and games to have a bunch of money.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t have a sense of purpose and if you don&rsquo;t have something you&rsquo;re contributing</p>
<p>or doing or just sharing and providing to anyone or anything, you&rsquo;re going to feel like</p>
<p>a waste.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to feel like there&rsquo;s no point to your life.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just going to feel like you&rsquo;re here to just take up space on this earth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just this natural desire we all have to contribute, create, do things, be of use</p>
<p>and connect with people.</p>
<p>And when you have no sense of purpose, that shit is painful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why everybody&rsquo;s trying to figure out what is my purpose?</p>
<p>What is my purpose?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re trying to figure out what it is.</p>
<p>But that void when you have money is 10 times worse because the money is such a distraction</p>
<p>from so many things that you feel.</p>
<p>So when you don&rsquo;t have money and you&rsquo;re trying to work a job and you&rsquo;re like concerned with</p>
<p>things financially, you feel that lack of purpose and lack of contribution and lack</p>
<p>of doing things that make you feel fulfilled.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not that strong because you have financial stress all around you.</p>
<p>It takes up a lot of your attention.</p>
<p>So when you get money on a level where you&rsquo;re financially free, all of that distraction</p>
<p>is gone.</p>
<p>And that pain you feel of that void of not feeling like you have a purpose or any use,</p>
<p>that shit, oh, it will eat you alive.</p>
<p>And having money makes it very clear.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no distraction.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no other distraction in your life.</p>
<p>Once you have money and you&rsquo;re financially free, you have to figure out what the fuck</p>
<p>it is that you&rsquo;re here to contribute and what you enjoy contributing and how you like being</p>
<p>of use to others.</p>
<p>Because if you don&rsquo;t, you will feel fucking worthless.</p>
<p>So that void of feeling like you have a sense of purpose, that shit, oh girl, it&rsquo;s rough.</p>
<p>Money can&rsquo;t cure that.</p>
<p>Money can&rsquo;t fix that.</p>
<p>When you find out what it is you want to do, money can give you things and give you resources</p>
<p>and help you push it and share it and do it better.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t know what that is and you just don&rsquo;t do it, that fucking void is going</p>
<p>to swallow you whole.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a big thing a lot of people don&rsquo;t think about.</p>
<p>A lot of influencers and really, really rich people, sure, they live a great, lavish life.</p>
<p>They are the most miserable fucks you will ever meet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to be mean, but there&rsquo;s this narrative painted that you&rsquo;re just supposed</p>
<p>to have money and just enjoy life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a difference between enjoying life and doing nothing.</p>
<p>And when all your money and time is focused on just enjoying life and vacationing and</p>
<p>relaxing and buying the nicest shit and eating the nicest dinners, that lack of contribution</p>
<p>is going to rot you from the inside out.</p>
<p>All these people are so miserable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to let you know right now, prepare yourself.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re working towards success and you&rsquo;re working toward financial freedom, your goal</p>
<p>better not be to just sit on your ass because it will only feel good for so long.</p>
<p>And that is why so many people who are so rich and successful or really all these things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to talk about are why everyone has to cope.</p>
<p>Rich people have the ability to cope in so many ways, drugs, alcohol, gambling, sex.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s everything you can imagine to cope with.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why people who are like ultra successful are the biggest fucking freaks and they be</p>
<p>doing the craziest shit.</p>
<p>They feel the most emotion they need to cope with and they have the resources to cope with</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m shedding a little light on all the things that I&rsquo;ve observed from my experience</p>
<p>of like hitting that level of financial freedom and all the shit that still felt so bad inside</p>
<p>of me.</p>
<p>So the next void money can&rsquo;t touch and money can&rsquo;t fill is the sense of loneliness.</p>
<p>Everyone feels money does not give you closeness with people because it does not impact your</p>
<p>ability to connect with people.</p>
<p>And I have a whole podcast episode about feeling isolated in a room full of people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s episode 50 of my podcast.</p>
<p>If you want to hear me talk about that, it&rsquo;s on YouTube and it&rsquo;s on Apple podcasts and</p>
<p>Spotify as the audio versions, but it&rsquo;s on YouTube as the video.</p>
<p>What I talked about in that, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how many people are around you, you still</p>
<p>feel isolated and why you feel that way and then how to get out of it.</p>
<p>But money does not give you any freedom from it at all.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s kind of like stepping into your authentic self.</p>
<p>You have to become your authentic self to truly feel connected to people or you will</p>
<p>always feel fucking lonely.</p>
<p>Money does not do shit for that.</p>
<p>That void cannot be filled with the money, no matter what you buy or who you pay for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never going to fill it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just something you have to do in yourself and money can&rsquo;t touch it.</p>
<p>Money can&rsquo;t influence it.</p>
<p>Because when I was over here like living large, I was a lonely fuck and I couldn&rsquo;t figure</p>
<p>out why.</p>
<p>And that pain is the worst pain a human being can feel is a sense of loneliness.</p>
<p>And so many people at the top are so big, but they&rsquo;re disconnected from everyone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to connect when you&rsquo;re at a certain level.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have the ability to connect, money is going to make you feel more disconnected</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to put you on a higher pedestal, not really like a pedestal, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll put you in a different lifestyle.</p>
<p>You have different worries.</p>
<p>You have different concerns.</p>
<p>You have different feelings and stronger ones.</p>
<p>You no longer can relate to most people.</p>
<p>And all these rich people got money.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t got social skills.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t get emotional intelligence.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t got the ability to connect.</p>
<p>So when you hit that lifestyle, you feel very isolated and your pool of people to relate</p>
<p>to also feels isolated, but none of them know how to connect.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s the biggest mindfuck and it&rsquo;s the weirdest shit.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s a big thing people cope with when they&rsquo;re really rich, that sense of isolation</p>
<p>and feeling lonely.</p>
<p>So money is not going to fill any void of loneliness at all.</p>
<p>You can pay for someone to be around you.</p>
<p>You can pay for a sugar baby.</p>
<p>You could pay a fucking prostitute.</p>
<p>You can literally pay for anyone&rsquo;s company, but you cannot pay for connection.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to hit on that at the end with my biggest point.</p>
<p>And a long time ago, I used to always think like money is all that I wanted.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s how I was raised.</p>
<p>And I was like taught money would save you and money is all that you&rsquo;ll ever need.</p>
<p>But when I was at a very, very low point in my life, I had access to certain money.</p>
<p>And like I said, when I hit access to a lot of money, I never felt worse than my life.</p>
<p>And this is most of the shit, but I was literally skateboarding downtown one time.</p>
<p>And this is when my whole materialistic shit stopped.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another experience I&rsquo;m going to get to, but this is the main one where I realized</p>
<p>money can&rsquo;t do shit for you if you don&rsquo;t have connection.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;d rather have connection over money.</p>
<p>So the way that I kind of like came across this, it hit me in the fucking face is I was</p>
<p>skateboarding downtown.</p>
<p>I used to have an electric skateboard and I was skateboarding with my friend Genevieve</p>
<p>because she had one too.</p>
<p>They go like 25 miles an hour.</p>
<p>Like they haul ass, but don&rsquo;t hit nothing because you fly off and die.</p>
<p>But I was out by myself one day, just like skateboarding around, like in my thoughts,</p>
<p>just trying to like figure out like the way that I was feeling.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fucking know.</p>
<p>I was just not okay.</p>
<p>And I was just like skateboarding around and just like looking around at shit.</p>
<p>And I had on like a little Versace bag and some like expensive sunglasses.</p>
<p>And I was just like riding around in my little designer shoes.</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t give a fuck.</p>
<p>Like I was just like riding around and I thought I looked cute.</p>
<p>I was like, yeah, I have my little Versace bag.</p>
<p>Like give a fuck.</p>
<p>And I used to think monetary items and shit you can buy mattered girl.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t fucking matter for shit.</p>
<p>So when I was skateboarding and my little designer shit, I rode past this group of friends</p>
<p>and there was like three friends who were also skateboarding.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have an electric skateboard.</p>
<p>They had regular skateboards and they were sitting in a parking lot together, just like</p>
<p>facing each other, sitting on their skateboards, like just talking and hanging out.</p>
<p>And I was at a point I was so fucking lonely and seeing them like the realization struck</p>
<p>me of like, okay, yes, I have a Versace bag.</p>
<p>I have some money in the bank.</p>
<p>I have some designer shit on, but they have each other.</p>
<p>And that moment literally like fucked me up because I realized in that moment what I truly</p>
<p>wanted was connection and people because I had all the shit and it didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I wanted what they had so bad, even though it wasn&rsquo;t as like fruitful and abundant and</p>
<p>like nice, I would gladly have traded in my electric skateboard and my Versace bag and</p>
<p>every fucking thing that I had to go get a normal skateboard and just hang out with these</p>
<p>fucking people just to have some company and some people I feel like I connected to and</p>
<p>have people there for me.</p>
<p>Like that is the moment my materialism stopped because I realized items are empty.</p>
<p>Money is empty.</p>
<p>Connection is what is fucking important.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the number one need for a human being, bitch.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way around it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we are.</p>
<p>But I really wanted to harp on this feeling of loneliness with money.</p>
<p>There is no way to fill it.</p>
<p>There is no way.</p>
<p>I tried every way.</p>
<p>The only way to fill the loneliness is to connect with people and money cannot touch</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>There is no way for it.</p>
<p>And like I said, hitting a level of money makes it harder to do that.</p>
<p>It gets harder to connect to people you can&rsquo;t fucking relate to and having a lot of money</p>
<p>like switches who you&rsquo;re allowed to relate to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fucking weird.</p>
<p>But there is ways for you to relate.</p>
<p>Even if you have money, you can relate to a fucking homeless person.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re a billionaire, you&rsquo;re still a human being at heart.</p>
<p>So I want everyone that watches this to know you are never void of connection.</p>
<p>It is all around you.</p>
<p>You can relate to every human being breathing on this earth because we&rsquo;re all humans.</p>
<p>We all feel the same shit.</p>
<p>You can relate in so many more ways than you think.</p>
<p>So one of my tricks for this is if you don&rsquo;t feel like a sense of belonging or connection,</p>
<p>look for how you&rsquo;re the same as people, not how you&rsquo;re different.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll be shocked at how many similarities you find and how many ways you feel you can</p>
<p>relate.</p>
<p>The next void money can&rsquo;t fill or really like the next thing that money can&rsquo;t help you with</p>
<p>is if you have a void in your health.</p>
<p>Like if you don&rsquo;t have your health, you don&rsquo;t have shit.</p>
<p>And I know I be smoking and I be drinking and I be doing my shit, but I also take care</p>
<p>of my body and I do things to counteract it when I do do it.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not an excess of anything.</p>
<p>I party.</p>
<p>I have fun.</p>
<p>I like to do things.</p>
<p>I like to escape and distract and shit like everybody else.</p>
<p>But I am very conscious and aware because being in the medical field as a nurse, what</p>
<p>I saw with people, I took care of so many people who are millionaires and your money</p>
<p>means nothing when you&rsquo;re in that bed and you have no one in the room with you.</p>
<p>And money means nothing if you cannot enjoy it.</p>
<p>Like I was deathly fucking sick in Rome.</p>
<p>Like I got to Rome a couple months ago and I got food poisoning and I literally could</p>
<p>not get up out of the bed.</p>
<p>I finally had money to spend.</p>
<p>I was in the perfect location, but my body was not able to go out and experience and</p>
<p>enjoy shit like sure I had money.</p>
<p>So what girl?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have health to enjoy it.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to ask for money, ask for the health to go with it so you can enjoy</p>
<p>it because one of the worst and most powerless feelings you can have is to have money and</p>
<p>be able to access everything you&rsquo;ve ever wanted and not be able to do it because your health</p>
<p>is not there.</p>
<p>Your health is number one.</p>
<p>And sure, there are a lot of things that money can give you access to heal you and help you</p>
<p>and recover.</p>
<p>But there are so many things money just can&rsquo;t touch.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what resource you have.</p>
<p>Some shit is irreversible.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just something I got to bring up because holy fuck, like I&rsquo;ve taken care of</p>
<p>too many people and I&rsquo;ve had too many personal experiences of having money, but not health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather have health every day of the fucking week.</p>
<p>Every day of my life rather have health.</p>
<p>I need to start acting like it then I need to stop smoking.</p>
<p>So the next void that money cannot fill is one that made me go fucking insane.</p>
<p>I had like a mental break when this happened.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna tell you a little story.</p>
<p>But the void money can&rsquo;t fill is your need for comfort and to feel comforted.</p>
<p>So one night I was sitting in a very nice house and a very nice place in very nice clothes</p>
<p>and I was sad and like next level fucking sad and just didn&rsquo;t know what the fuck to</p>
<p>do with myself.</p>
<p>Like all I could do was just fucking cry.</p>
<p>Nothing was making me feel better.</p>
<p>No thought I could think made me feel better.</p>
<p>Nothing I could do physically in my external made me feel better.</p>
<p>I was in so much internal turmoil and I felt such like bad shit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting like the chills even thinking about that fucking night again.</p>
<p>But I was sitting there and I had on Cartier all over my hands and my wrists like I was</p>
<p>covered in fucking Cartier jewelry, a Rolex, all these designer clothes and I was just</p>
<p>fucking crying like literally just could not stop uncontrollable like not panic attack,</p>
<p>but it started to get there because I was looking at all the shit that I had on and</p>
<p>I started to freak out like I genuinely started to like lose my fucking mind because these</p>
<p>items that I had, I thought we&rsquo;re gonna be able to help me like the jewelry, the clothes,</p>
<p>the shit, the nice house, the lifestyle, the fucking cars, the money.</p>
<p>Like I thought all of this was supposed to help me.</p>
<p>And when I looked down at my hands and I saw all my jewelry and I literally was like looking</p>
<p>at all my clothes, I started freaking the fuck out and started ripping it all off of</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>Like I threw my fucking Rolex across the room.</p>
<p>I was on one bitch.</p>
<p>I was so upset.</p>
<p>But I started snatching off all my fucking jewelry.</p>
<p>I took off all my clothes and like put on just normal, like basic clothes that I had</p>
<p>from champs.</p>
<p>I love clothes from champs.</p>
<p>Little CSG brand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cheap dick.</p>
<p>This is not sponsored, but like I love champs clothes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve loved them since I&rsquo;m like 18 because they make good sizes.</p>
<p>They make my size.</p>
<p>So I just put on like my little $40 hoodie and my fucking $20 sweatpants.</p>
<p>And I just like cried because seeing everything on me that is supposed to make you like feel</p>
<p>better and it&rsquo;s supposed to be like the point of life that people make it seem pissed me</p>
<p>off seeing it because it comforted me in no fucking way.</p>
<p>And the reason this shit like fucked with me so bad is because online and in life in</p>
<p>general, people paint like this narrative with money.</p>
<p>Like they have the nice cars, they have the jewelry, they have the clothes, they have</p>
<p>the bags, they have everything.</p>
<p>Like everything looks pretty and it&rsquo;s expensive as fuck.</p>
<p>And they never share even one inkling of feeling negative emotions or dealing with chaos or</p>
<p>dealing with pain or dealing with anything.</p>
<p>It just seems like as soon as you get access to this lifestyle and your life looks like</p>
<p>this, you&rsquo;re just going to feel good.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to have any negative emotions.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not that I was consciously thinking this, it was subconscious.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just when something&rsquo;s painted in front of you, you just make assumptions without</p>
<p>realizing like it was just subconscious thoughts of like, once my life is like this, everything</p>
<p>is going to be fine.</p>
<p>And it fucking wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I like turn my back and started to resent the money and resent the designer</p>
<p>shit and the jewelry and everything.</p>
<p>I was like, fuck this shit.</p>
<p>I literally got so mad at it because I was like, this is not what y&rsquo;all painted out to</p>
<p>be.</p>
<p>This is not cool.</p>
<p>This is not fun.</p>
<p>This does not help me.</p>
<p>This does not make me feel good.</p>
<p>It makes me feel worse because subconsciously this is how life was supposed to be.</p>
<p>And it ain&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>Like your need for comfort cannot be touched with money at all.</p>
<p>And that literally left me to just sit there and think that something was so wrong.</p>
<p>And it freaked me out because I couldn&rsquo;t figure it out.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s my next point I&rsquo;m diving into is money cannot fill the void of feeling defective</p>
<p>and feeling like you are not good enough, feeling like you are not good enough is something</p>
<p>that every single human being deals with.</p>
<p>I have worked with and coached people who are like uber wealthy and people who are poor</p>
<p>and something consistent across the board is not feeling good enough.</p>
<p>And from my personal experience of going through this shit, it gets so much more painful the</p>
<p>more money you have and the more shit that you buy because everyone deals with not feeling</p>
<p>good enough.</p>
<p>Most of us assume things that we think will make us be good enough.</p>
<p>And for me, for so long, I was like, once I have money, I&rsquo;ll be good enough.</p>
<p>Once I can pay to fix my style, pay to fix my car, pay to fix everything about my life</p>
<p>physically and monetarily, then it&rsquo;s going to be fine.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s going to be okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s wrong with me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s wrong with my life.</p>
<p>And a lot of people have that thought like, oh, this is what makes me feel defective.</p>
<p>This is what makes me not feel good enough.</p>
<p>Like I can just achieve my way out of not feeling good enough.</p>
<p>And then once I got it, I had everything that I had convinced myself made me not good enough.</p>
<p>And that feeling of not being good enough was there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like someone shot me in my fucking chest.</p>
<p>Like it was more obvious than ever.</p>
<p>And it was so much more painful than ever of feeling not good enough.</p>
<p>Because when you don&rsquo;t have money or you&rsquo;re working towards something, it&rsquo;s easy to be</p>
<p>like, okay, and deal with not feeling good enough because you feel like the solution</p>
<p>is coming.</p>
<p>This feeling I&rsquo;m feeling as soon as I achieve this or have this much money or buy this or</p>
<p>do this, I&rsquo;m going to feel good enough.</p>
<p>But then you hit it and you achieve the thing or you get the thing.</p>
<p>And that feeling of not feeling good enough is still there waiting for you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s just there waiting for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s there like, yeah, bitch, I&rsquo;ve been waiting.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gonna fucking knock you on your ass because it&rsquo;s so much worse.</p>
<p>Once you achieve shit that you thought was gonna make you feel good enough, and it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s literally like what now?</p>
<p>Like that sense of feeling defective is 10 times worse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally 10 times fucking worse because you have no control anymore.</p>
<p>You get to convince yourself once I get XYZ, then I&rsquo;ll feel good enough.</p>
<p>Once you get it, you look around, you&rsquo;re like, I still don&rsquo;t feel good enough.</p>
<p>Now I have everything.</p>
<p>What the fuck is the real issue?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know why you feel so defective.</p>
<p>And it makes you freak out.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s no way to pinpoint something you can do to make it feel better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re just trapped in it and you&rsquo;re forced to sit there with that feeling.</p>
<p>So money cannot fill the void of feeling defective and not feeling good enough.</p>
<p>And money cannot even comfort you when you&rsquo;re feeling that shit.</p>
<p>So babe, I&rsquo;m trying to prepare you with this episode.</p>
<p>When you hit the level of money you want to hit, remember everything I&rsquo;m saying, rewatch</p>
<p>this video.</p>
<p>Girl, there&rsquo;s a lot of shit you got to get together before you get to the money or it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna hurt your feelings.</p>
<p>So the next void money can&rsquo;t fill is feeling insecure and feeling like you don&rsquo;t fit in</p>
<p>or belong.</p>
<p>And I kind of had this realization when I was moving into this apartment.</p>
<p>I could afford the apartment.</p>
<p>I looked the part.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve reached money now on my own where I&rsquo;m able to like elevate my style.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m able to buy shit that I want to fucking buy.</p>
<p>I look the way I do.</p>
<p>I present the way that I do.</p>
<p>I can afford this fucking place.</p>
<p>I never thought I would be able to on my own.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so proud of myself.</p>
<p>But my point is, I looked the part and I could afford this place.</p>
<p>And when I moved in, I felt so insecure walking in the lobby and touring this place and living</p>
<p>here for like the first couple of weeks I was here.</p>
<p>And then I had to check myself and be like, Leo, get the fuck real.</p>
<p>But the feeling of insecurity, not feeling worthy and not feeling like you fit in, even</p>
<p>when everything external shows that you fit in, you can afford it.</p>
<p>You look the part, you dress the part.</p>
<p>But that feeling state, there&rsquo;s no getting out of that.</p>
<p>Money cannot touch a feeling of insecurity.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t do shit for it.</p>
<p>Money can give you things that will externally make you feel a little bit better.</p>
<p>But that feeling, it can&rsquo;t touch because the feeling of security comes from who you are</p>
<p>as a person and what you think about yourself, your confidence, what you&rsquo;re capable of.</p>
<p>All of that is what contributes to that feeling of feeling secure.</p>
<p>And when you feel insecure, you feel like people can tell.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re insecure, you&rsquo;re automatically assuming people are judging you.</p>
<p>When I was walking in my apartment for the first time, I was thinking these people were</p>
<p>fucking judging the shit out of me.</p>
<p>But in reality, nobody was because there&rsquo;s no external way to know I was feeling the</p>
<p>way that I felt.</p>
<p>Everybody else just saw me as normal, saw that I fit in.</p>
<p>But me being insecure, I convinced myself everybody knew.</p>
<p>Like that whole imposter syndrome, I felt like everybody could just tell.</p>
<p>They fucking couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you trapped yourself in your own world when you&rsquo;re insecure and it&rsquo;s a painful</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>And you have to remind yourself, no one can tell the way that you&rsquo;re feeling.</p>
<p>So the whole fake it till you make it thing kind of works.</p>
<p>But if you want to absolve that feeling state inside yourself, that&rsquo;s a whole different</p>
<p>story.</p>
<p>And money can&rsquo;t help with that.</p>
<p>And this is so prevalent in like the designer fashion scene and like the cars and the money</p>
<p>and shit.</p>
<p>Like people flex their lifestyle and they flex all this shit to feel worthy, to feel</p>
<p>less insecure.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh, I have this watch.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like they don&rsquo;t even have to entertain the thought of not being good enough or not</p>
<p>being worth the shit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like they just get to deflect any thought that makes them insecure.</p>
<p>I have this watch.</p>
<p>I have this car.</p>
<p>I have this boat.</p>
<p>I have this house.</p>
<p>I have all these clothes.</p>
<p>I have this designer shit.</p>
<p>It kind of prevents them from actually looking at themselves and assessing themselves because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to have that realization.</p>
<p>I really am not shit.</p>
<p>And I am cripplingly insecure.</p>
<p>They just blind themselves with flexing their way out of it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m able to talk about it because bitch, I&rsquo;ve been there and it&rsquo;s not fun.</p>
<p>But my point with that is there&rsquo;s no way to flex your way out of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to buy enough shit to feel secure.</p>
<p>It comes from who you are inside.</p>
<p>And the thing that kind of goes along with that is lack of discipline.</p>
<p>Money can&rsquo;t fill that void, bitch.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all action.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all self-control and self-respect and discipline.</p>
<p>There is no way to buy that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a way to buy it.</p>
<p>Because if you look at all these rich people, a lot of them have fucked up bodies.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying fucked up to be rude.</p>
<p>They want to bypass and skip working out and actually being fit and disciplined and taking</p>
<p>care of themselves.</p>
<p>They just get lipo or they get implants to look like they have muscles and they look</p>
<p>fucked up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to cheat that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to pay for that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to buy things that can only be achieved through true discipline.</p>
<p>Money can&rsquo;t touch it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very obvious when people try and like shortcut it.</p>
<p>But money just&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to get around discipline, bitch.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to get around it at all.</p>
<p>And money can&rsquo;t help with that.</p>
<p>You just have to have that in yourself and just do it.</p>
<p>The next void money can&rsquo;t fill, I&rsquo;m going to hit this one real quick, is feeling lost</p>
<p>and feeling like you have no direction in life.</p>
<p>What the fuck is money supposed to do?</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t get better when you have more money.</p>
<p>More money is just going to lead to less distraction and more focus on feeling lost.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to feel more lost the more money you have.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have more awareness and more focus on the actual lack of direction you</p>
<p>have.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what the fuck to do, bitch, there&rsquo;s no way to find out.</p>
<p>Money can&rsquo;t help you.</p>
<p>You just have to try shit and discover yourself and have experiences and learn.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to shortcut that.</p>
<p>Money can&rsquo;t help you with that.</p>
<p>So if you feel lost and you think having money is going to make you feel more secure, girl,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to feel 10 times more lost.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have more resources to explore, which is good.</p>
<p>It will make it easier.</p>
<p>But not having a sense of direction, she&rsquo;s here to stay until you do something about</p>
<p>it and you can&rsquo;t pay for it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>One of the biggest voids that I was not aware of until this shit happened to me, that money</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t fill, is damage caused by someone disrespecting you or breaking your trust.</p>
<p>Money has no way to govern that, help that, or make it better at all.</p>
<p>Your relationships with people cannot be repaired with money.</p>
<p>It does not matter how much money I hand you or you hand me.</p>
<p>Some shit is irreparable.</p>
<p>Some shit can only be fixed between human beings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that connection part.</p>
<p>Connection can&rsquo;t be fucked with, with money.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing you can do to fix it.</p>
<p>You can do gestures for it.</p>
<p>That will lead you to feel a little bit more forgiving and assured.</p>
<p>But money can&rsquo;t repair damage that&rsquo;s caused between people.</p>
<p>Relationships are so fragile.</p>
<p>And the only way to navigate them, to help them, to fix them, is with human beings.</p>
<p>And your ability to connect, your emotional maturity, your intelligence, how you handle</p>
<p>shit, the way you communicate, that&rsquo;s all that can influence it.</p>
<p>Money can&rsquo;t do nothing for you, bitch.</p>
<p>What are you going to go pay for a therapist so you can understand more?</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>You still have to go implement it and repair it yourself.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just go learn shit or throw money at a problem you have with someone and expect</p>
<p>it to go away.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>People might be able to pretend that something isn&rsquo;t hurtful anymore, they&rsquo;re okay, or they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>past it.</p>
<p>But that emotional damage that&rsquo;s caused by someone betraying you or disrespecting you</p>
<p>or breaking your trust?</p>
<p>No fixing it.</p>
<p>Money can&rsquo;t do shit about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a skill you have to have on your own.</p>
<p>So remember me saying, money can&rsquo;t fix that hole once it&rsquo;s created.</p>
<p>Money can&rsquo;t fill it.</p>
<p>I think I need to fix this lighting because I look like a fucking ghost, like I&rsquo;m telling</p>
<p>a ghost story.</p>
<p>Hang on.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The lighting&rsquo;s a little fucked up, but whatever.</p>
<p>I recorded at the wrong time of the day.</p>
<p>Sue me.</p>
<p>So the next void money can&rsquo;t fill is something that&rsquo;s pissing me off recently because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going through it now and it&rsquo;s lack of knowledge.</p>
<p>Goddamn.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so frustrating because sure, if you have a lot of money, you can pay to learn things.</p>
<p>You still got to learn them, bitch.</p>
<p>You still got to learn the things that you need to know and then apply it.</p>
<p>But also it&rsquo;s like the knowledge of who to go to, what to do, how to handle certain shit.</p>
<p>You just have to learn it.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no way for money to like impact that.</p>
<p>Something that&rsquo;s been stressing me the fuck out is taxes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fucking fully get it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how to do them now that I&rsquo;m self-employed and I don&rsquo;t know, it just stresses</p>
<p>me the fuck out.</p>
<p>So I need to find an accountant.</p>
<p>Finding an accountant has been the biggest pain in the dick I&rsquo;ve ever experienced.</p>
<p>None of them want to work apparently, or they want to charge me five grand to file my taxes.</p>
<p>Girl, fuck you.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The next thing is a financial advisor.</p>
<p>Because now that I have the money, I don&rsquo;t know what the fuck to do with it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where to put it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to avoid taxes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to like sort it out and where to put it and how to store it.</p>
<p>And like, what&rsquo;s the most optimal.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know this shit.</p>
<p>And what makes it worse is like, I don&rsquo;t know what to do about it.</p>
<p>And then I don&rsquo;t know how to find someone who I can trust that knows how to fucking</p>
<p>do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just pissing me off.</p>
<p>But also with that, I need attorneys for the company that I&rsquo;m about to start.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you more details soon.</p>
<p>But I need a trademark attorney.</p>
<p>And then I need like a legal attorney for like, shit that I can and can&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>Girl, there&rsquo;s so much fucking money.</p>
<p>I can afford it.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>But finding out what attorney I actually need and finding out which accountant I actually</p>
<p>need and what to actually do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so frustrating.</p>
<p>Like money and accessing money at a level that I have on my own.</p>
<p>Now I don&rsquo;t know what the fuck to do with it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a whole new level of stress because taxes you cannot fuck around with.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not getting any type of messy with the IRS.</p>
<p>No thank you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna play that shit safe.</p>
<p>But this is just like a frustrating standpoint to be in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to find other people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be fine.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m speaking it into existence, bitch.</p>
<p>Stop fucking with me.</p>
<p>Just let me like attract an accountant.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need a boyfriend.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s too much for you.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>But can you give me an accountant and like a lawyer too?</p>
<p>But on some real shit, that&rsquo;s something I didn&rsquo;t realize is like money can&rsquo;t help you</p>
<p>with that.</p>
<p>Like knowledge, knowing what to do with shit or how to find things and like access resources.</p>
<p>Difficult.</p>
<p>And having the money, girl, I have it.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>What the fuck do I do with it?</p>
<p>So my next void money can&rsquo;t fill.</p>
<p>We have two left.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m going to tell you the most like important one and the deepest one that really</p>
<p>hurt my feelings when I realized it.</p>
<p>But this one is people&rsquo;s perception of you.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a void in that money can&rsquo;t touch it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to speak on this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>I had this episode scheduled to make and then I had to throw this point in because it got</p>
<p>canceled this week on Tuesday.</p>
<p>People took some shit I said out of context, tried to cancel me for it, girl.</p>
<p>But the point is, money cannot influence or impact people&rsquo;s perception of you.</p>
<p>When I was going through this certain narrative being pushed about me online, and all these</p>
<p>new people getting exposed to me and seeing me in a certain light that wasn&rsquo;t accurate,</p>
<p>there was nothing I can do to stop it.</p>
<p>There is no way to change people&rsquo;s perception of you with money.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no safety with money.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s none at all.</p>
<p>That is something you can&rsquo;t touch.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, I have money now.</p>
<p>What got me out of it was clearing it up myself and handling it myself and offering the explanation</p>
<p>that cleared people&rsquo;s perception of me.</p>
<p>But some people&rsquo;s perception of me is already stuck and it&rsquo;s staying and it&rsquo;s solid.</p>
<p>Like some people wanted to misconstrue some shit and take off fucking running with it</p>
<p>and paint me in a bad light.</p>
<p>Best believe, bitch, as soon as something comes out about you and people paint you in</p>
<p>the wrong light, I&rsquo;m a fucking be there.</p>
<p>The same way you just did this shit to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a be there and watch it be done to you.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been doing research about every single person who made a fucking video about</p>
<p>me and spread this misinformation.</p>
<p>Girl, I&rsquo;ve been digging on all of you and y&rsquo;all got some fucking skeletons in your goddamn</p>
<p>closet.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny because as soon as I said this on TikTok, all these people started removing</p>
<p>their videos.</p>
<p>All these people started coming out with apologies and shit toward me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this one cunt that won&rsquo;t shut the fuck up and keeps running her mouth.</p>
<p>I already got dirt on her.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m playing the long game.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m waiting on people to cancel her.</p>
<p>And when that fires are going, I&rsquo;m going to take what the fuck I found and throw the</p>
<p>gas on top, just like you did to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do it to you.</p>
<p>I hope you can handle it.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;re strong enough to fucking handle what you just dished out because you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to get it back.</p>
<p>Your actions against me will bite you in the ass always, and I will make sure of it because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the snake.</p>
<p>Anyway, let me move on from that because I&rsquo;m getting riled the fuck up.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m just so sick of that situation, but it really showed me how fragile people&rsquo;s perception</p>
<p>is and how people can just get one idea of you in their mind and they&rsquo;re gone and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no change in it.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no change in their mind once their narrative of you serves them because</p>
<p>everybody that was fucking like pissed off at me, they painted me out to be the villain</p>
<p>off of some misinformation.</p>
<p>And when a villain exists, they got to be the hero.</p>
<p>They got to feel justified and they got to feel like they were protecting and helping.</p>
<p>They got to be a public hero for standing up against the villain.</p>
<p>When I revealed the truth of shit and it revealed that there was no longer a villain,</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t handle it because when there&rsquo;s no villain, it means you&rsquo;re not actually a</p>
<p>fucking hero.</p>
<p>And now you look like a goddamn dick.</p>
<p>Now you look like the fucking villain spreading misinformation on people.</p>
<p>So funny how the little power play works and how it bits you in the ass.</p>
<p>But there is absolutely no changing people&rsquo;s mind with money.</p>
<p>Money cannot help you with that.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a void in your perception, girl, you got to fill that shit yourself.</p>
<p>You either got to make up for what you did wrong, fix it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say fucking sorry.</p>
<p>I changed my actions.</p>
<p>I have a weird relationship with apologies.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fucking apologize.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say sorry.</p>
<p>I literally will just fix the situation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see in my actions that I&rsquo;m fucking sorry.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll prove it because people throw around, I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m this, I&rsquo;m that, and they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>change a fuck thing.</p>
<p>Girl, I don&rsquo;t give a fuck about your, I&rsquo;m sorry, shove it in your ass.</p>
<p>And everybody was so pissed off.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get one out of me.</p>
<p>I will offer you an explanation.</p>
<p>And then you can just watch my changed actions.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s so mad.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say sorry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know you fucking shit.</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all took it out of context thinking that you knew me and ran in the wrong direction</p>
<p>and saying sorry does nothing.</p>
<p>One, I didn&rsquo;t do shit to say sorry for girl.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I spoke out of character.</p>
<p>I made a video pissed off.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>I spoke and used hand gestures that led something to be taken in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>I can take accountability for that.</p>
<p>But just because something got misinterpreted wrong does not mean what I was saying was</p>
<p>wrong.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s clear it out the fuck up real quick.</p>
<p>But my point with this one is your reputation and the light you&rsquo;re painted in is very sensitive</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no way to fix it and no way to touch it.</p>
<p>Even if you have money, there are things you can do like the Kardashians.</p>
<p>If someone says something about them, they can send them a cease and desist.</p>
<p>They can sue them.</p>
<p>They can pay these websites to take down anything about them.</p>
<p>But once that impression is already in people&rsquo;s heads, there&rsquo;s no getting it out.</p>
<p>Money can&rsquo;t help you with that.</p>
<p>Okay, so for the last void money can&rsquo;t fill.</p>
<p>Oh, bitch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s people genuinely caring about you and taking you into consideration.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to unpack this real quick.</p>
<p>There is nothing you can do financially to make someone genuinely care about you or take</p>
<p>you into consideration.</p>
<p>And a lot of people, especially Europeans, you grow up with parents who are transactional</p>
<p>as fuck.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll provide for you monetarily.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s hidden expectations around it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very transactional with your parents and people get into relationships like this</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s very transactional.</p>
<p>And when you are the one being given money or being paid for or being accommodated, the</p>
<p>person providing that expects you to care about them or at least act like you do and</p>
<p>take them into consideration.</p>
<p>Now from someone on the opposite side of it, the one that&rsquo;s not handing out the money,</p>
<p>the one that&rsquo;s getting the money, that is not a genuine way to get someone to care about</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>All these parents that put their children in transactions with them, oh, I do this and</p>
<p>that for you.</p>
<p>So you owe me this respect.</p>
<p>You owe me this.</p>
<p>You owe me that.</p>
<p>The love you feel like you&rsquo;re getting in return is not actually genuine.</p>
<p>Most times when it is transactional, like the way I used to be is when someone would</p>
<p>do something for me, I felt obligated.</p>
<p>And like I was in debt, like I had to take this person into consideration.</p>
<p>And I felt like I had to do things to prove that I cared about this person.</p>
<p>So the person with the money dishing it out, they got to feel cared for.</p>
<p>They got to feel like they were taken into consideration.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not genuine.</p>
<p>Nine times out of 10, it&rsquo;s not fucking genuine.</p>
<p>If all you&rsquo;re contributing to someone is money or some shit you could buy them, it&rsquo;s an obligated</p>
<p>reciprocation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a transaction, babe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not genuine.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something people don&rsquo;t realize.</p>
<p>Like a lot of people with money, there&rsquo;s no way to buy someone genuinely caring about</p>
<p>you and genuinely taking you into consideration because they&rsquo;re concerned for you and they</p>
<p>care for you.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll do shit that looks like that.</p>
<p>But every single person who is like at a high level financially that tries to pay for a</p>
<p>sugar baby, pay for anyone, pay for a relationship, pay for a business partner, and like provide</p>
<p>to people, they feel that fucking void because they know it&rsquo;s not real.</p>
<p>When you have someone genuinely care for you and you&rsquo;re not giving them shit monetarily,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just giving them yourself and your relationship with you, that&rsquo;s how you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking genuine.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re contributing shit, you&rsquo;ll never be able to know.</p>
<p>You will.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not saying everyone that&rsquo;s taken care of financially or given things doesn&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>about the person doing it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not something you can buy is to genuinely be cared for or genuinely be taken</p>
<p>into consideration.</p>
<p>And a lot of people can&rsquo;t fucking handle that.</p>
<p>And a lot of rich people feel that void.</p>
<p>They feel that they don&rsquo;t actually feel close with the person that they&rsquo;re paying for or</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re doing shit for.</p>
<p>They feel that the love that they&rsquo;re getting back is obligated love, not because they genuinely</p>
<p>care.</p>
<p>So these are some of the biggest voids that I personally think money cannot fill.</p>
<p>From my own experience, this is what the fuck I got.</p>
<p>So I just gave it all to you.</p>
<p>If you like this video, leave it a thumbs up.</p>
<p>Leave me a comment down below what you thought, because I really want to dissect this shit.</p>
<p>So play around in the comments.</p>
<p>Tell me what you thought.</p>
<p>And if you want to submit your situation for advice for what would Leo do, the link is</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget all of my social media and everywhere you can keep up with me, my merch, everything</p>
<p>you need from me will also be in the description.</p>
<p>But everybody be safe.</p>
<p>Take care of yourself.</p>
<p>Prepare yourself before you get money for all these little heartbreaks that are going</p>
<p>to happen.</p>
<p>I want money to be a more realistic experience.</p>
<p>And this is kind of like me telling you the truth about it.</p>
<p>So I hope you liked it.</p>
<p>Like I said, take care of your goddamn self.</p>
<p>Love you.</p>
<p>And I will talk to you guys next Sunday.</p>
