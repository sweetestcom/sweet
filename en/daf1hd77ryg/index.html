<p>﻿[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>welcome back everyone we&rsquo;re here with</p>
<p>another show and we have a lot of people</p>
<p>lined up I always like to just Dive</p>
<p>Right In and of course give you a</p>
<p>disclaimer that um we&rsquo;re not here to</p>
<p>cure you if you happen to be cured by</p>
<p>anything we said don&rsquo;t mention our names</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>check with your doctor before</p>
<p>implementing any of these things or or</p>
<p>stopping any type of chemicals you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking and definitely with replacement</p>
<p>of any type of natural remedy you know</p>
<p>make sure you check with your doctor</p>
<p>before you do that all right</p>
<p>very good if there are any quote unquote</p>
<p>cures or incidental uh let&rsquo;s see why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we go straight to the internet</p>
<p>this time from YouTube uh Alyssa is</p>
<p>intermittent fasting the best way to</p>
<p>lower body body fat percentage</p>
<p>it sure is because if you compare</p>
<p>intermittent fasting to</p>
<p>um just Keto</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>keto does tend to help you burn fat</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s low carb but the fact that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating anything can also</p>
<p>stimulate some insulin so how do we</p>
<p>maximize this lowering of insulin well</p>
<p>we fast and the intermittent fasting is</p>
<p>a great way to lose the most weight and</p>
<p>the more you fast the more you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to lose</p>
<p>the question is um</p>
<p>how to do it healthily you have to con</p>
<p>you have to phase into it correctly take</p>
<p>the right nutrition and make sure that</p>
<p>you um</p>
<p>adapt to your fat</p>
<p>um within probably two to three days and</p>
<p>if you do it correctly your appetite</p>
<p>will go away and so it makes it easier</p>
<p>to do this</p>
<p>very good okay here&rsquo;s an interesting one</p>
<p>from Rosie on YouTube what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>difference between prescription vitamin</p>
<p>D and Vitamin D supplements my joints</p>
<p>eight when I took the vitamin D</p>
<p>prescription</p>
<p>you know um most of the time when you</p>
<p>get prescribed vitamin D it&rsquo;s usually a</p>
<p>in a D2 prescription vitamin D2 which is</p>
<p>different than D3 it&rsquo;s not as potent and</p>
<p>uh it&rsquo;s made synthetically and so it has</p>
<p>different effects and um even the</p>
<p>research</p>
<p>um between D2 and D3 show different</p>
<p>outcomes which is interesting so um a</p>
<p>lot of times they&rsquo;ll say</p>
<p>some benefits from from vitamin D that</p>
<p>were not done from D2</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re not really comparing apples</p>
<p>and oranges so unfortunately I think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more problems with D2 than D3</p>
<p>okay very good we&rsquo;re going to start with</p>
<p>our first guest from The Green Room</p>
<p>coming to us all the way from India and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a husband and wife team rajmi is</p>
<p>the wife but her husband&rsquo;s on with her</p>
<p>uh to describe their questions so uh</p>
<p>Rashmi and husband you&rsquo;re on with Dr</p>
<p>Burr go ahead with your question</p>
<p>yeah thank you so Russian suffering from</p>
<p>IBS for the last 15 years and she has</p>
<p>lost weight from 50 kilograms to 30</p>
<p>kilograms now</p>
<p>she she has she has very limited diet</p>
<p>because anything she eats she cannot</p>
<p>digest so she is on basically rice rice</p>
<p>chapatis we call and some vegetables and</p>
<p>if she has even little food she feels</p>
<p>full</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s losing strength and for so many</p>
<p>years and our question was what food she</p>
<p>should take or what medicines</p>
<p>um she should have to get away uh gain</p>
<p>weight and strength yeah</p>
<p>so I think he I hope you&rsquo;re sitting down</p>
<p>for this uh recommendation</p>
<p>um because this might be a big change</p>
<p>for her but I think it will work very</p>
<p>nicely</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>pardon me</p>
<p>oh standby Dr Berg will give you his</p>
<p>answer yeah so here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s uh what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to recommend that you do for her</p>
<p>or she needs to do</p>
<p>um all the fiber the fiber from the</p>
<p>vegetables unfortunately and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to work for an inflamed gut</p>
<p>um especially the grains or beans or</p>
<p>typically a lot of the foods that they</p>
<p>have in India you&rsquo;re going to run into</p>
<p>trouble what she really needs to do uh</p>
<p>and this might be shocking to you but it</p>
<p>will work and start to do the the</p>
<p>carnivore okay this means that uh</p>
<p>exclusively animal products now before</p>
<p>you click off and go oh my gosh I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do that you should look at some of the</p>
<p>research I&rsquo;ve done or not I&rsquo;ve done but</p>
<p>other people have done in some of the</p>
<p>videos that I talk about relating to gut</p>
<p>health and the type of diet you should</p>
<p>be on is basically without the fiber and</p>
<p>without the vegetables and I think</p>
<p>she&rsquo;ll heal from that so she can do</p>
<p>um you know eggs she can do fish she can</p>
<p>do Meats that are fatty and she&rsquo;ll find</p>
<p>that her gut is going to do much much</p>
<p>better from them</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>I see mute on his speaker oh that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>right can you can you hear Dr Berg he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the midst of giving you your answer</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>okay just tell</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve kind of muted out doc go ahead and</p>
<p>um and okay so just just you can tell</p>
<p>him that you can watch this video later</p>
<p>and this sound will be recorded</p>
<p>very good okay so Rashmi uh and husband</p>
<p>thank you so much for coming on with Dr</p>
<p>Berg once again tune in to YouTube or</p>
<p>Facebook later and you can hear uh</p>
<p>clearly uh Dr Berg&rsquo;s complete uh answer</p>
<p>description to what&rsquo;s going on with you</p>
<p>too and we appreciate you uh coming on</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d love to hear from you either</p>
<p>through email or coming back on here to</p>
<p>tell about rashmi&rsquo;s progress so let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>back to social media and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>acknowledge who in the world is listen</p>

<p>Serbia Nicaragua and all across these</p>
<p>United States and Terry is always thank</p>
<p>you for your dutiful typing of all that</p>
<p>stuff so welcome everyone and we usually</p>
<p>will probably have a few more that will</p>
<p>chime in jealously after they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hear their name and now so thank you</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s waiting to hear maybe um the</p>
<p>Amazon and deep in the Amazons if we</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t had them yet let&rsquo;s try we can</p>
<p>listen to us</p>
<p>deep in the Amazon or even North Korea</p>
<p>or even Venezuela how come they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>tuning in so we need to reach out a</p>
<p>little bit further Steve absolutely well</p>
<p>Elon Musk will probably have a satellite</p>
<p>flying over there shortly so we&rsquo;ll even</p>
<p>increase the amount of folks that great</p>
<p>get great benefit from uh your Council</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s see uh let&rsquo;s go back to the</p>
<p>uh social media again</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>Mariana I believe is her name excuse me</p>
<p>uh should polyarthritis be treated the</p>
<p>same way as gout</p>
<p>no no uh it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s two different</p>
<p>things uh the gout usually comes from a</p>
<p>uric acid problem a buildup and of</p>
<p>course the UPS man just pulled up so</p>
<p>sorry about the background noise but</p>
<p>gout has to do with the inability of the</p>
<p>kidney to release this uric acid so it</p>
<p>tends to deposit in your big toe I will</p>
<p>be releasing a very interesting video on</p>
<p>what to do if you have that problem</p>
<p>which is some new information which will</p>
<p>explain all the paradoxes and the</p>
<p>the opposing conflicting things because</p>
<p>like uric acid is supposed to be a</p>
<p>potent</p>
<p>antioxidant right well then why does it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the biggest predictors of</p>
<p>heart disease then why is it um creating</p>
<p>all this oxidation in your toe well</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll explain that as far as poly</p>
<p>arthritis which is occurring in many</p>
<p>many joints that can also come from an</p>
<p>autoimmune but also Osteo and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>many different causes for that but when</p>
<p>you deal with inflammation in general</p>
<p>okay across the board</p>
<p>um the best thing to do is to get rid of</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>omega-6 fatty acids out of your diet</p>
<p>increase</p>
<p>the omega-3 fatty acids and take a lot</p>
<p>more vitamin D3</p>
<p>can you tell us what omega-6 are many</p>
<p>may know but I don&rsquo;t that&rsquo;s all the</p>
<p>vegetable oils like the uh the soy the</p>
<p>corn oil the canola oil the cottonseed</p>
<p>oil even the peanut oil and the</p>
<p>safflower and the sunflower oil all the</p>
<p>oils that are supposed to be healthy for</p>
<p>you and that are replacing the saturated</p>
<p>fats in your grocery store so when you</p>
<p>have the salad dressings and the</p>
<p>mayonnaise and all these other if you go</p>
<p>out to a restaurant well they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be cooking in the vegetable oil</p>
<p>unfortunately okay throw them out</p>
<p>audience for gosh sakes get rid of all</p>
<p>that junk let&rsquo;s get on to some omega-3</p>
<p>together why don&rsquo;t we start off with our</p>
<p>first question in this case it&rsquo;s a true</p>
<p>falser</p>
<p>all right true or false uh pork in beef</p>
<p>fat that would be like Tallow and lard</p>
<p>contain 50 of the mono unsaturated fats</p>
<p>you know like the that&rsquo;s like the main</p>
<p>fat in olive oil and and avocado oil so</p>
<p>true or false pork and beef contain 50</p>
<p>of that type of fat</p>
<p>I mean let the audience study that just</p>
<p>so they can that&rsquo;s sort of a a big one</p>
<p>so audience eat that up and give us your</p>
<p>usual quick response and let&rsquo;s go back</p>
<p>to social media Len from Facebook I lost</p>
<p>70 pounds on your program four years ago</p>
<p>but gained back 15 cents and I&rsquo;m having</p>
<p>trouble losing weight now what can I do</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m assuming you went back to</p>
<p>what was successful before you&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>surprised how many people don&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>um but um sometimes uh becomes even over</p>
<p>time you start losing and your body</p>
<p>adapts to this because see the body does</p>
<p>not like to get rid of fat fat is a</p>
<p>survival thing and so it likes to hold</p>
<p>on the fat you probably already know</p>
<p>that because you&rsquo;ve experienced that</p>
<p>um so shift your gear</p>
<p>your gears into getting healthy and uh</p>
<p>and running your body off that fuel by</p>
<p>um extending the time you fast so do it</p>
<p>longer so if you&rsquo;re at two meals go to</p>
<p>one meal if you&rsquo;re doing one meal try to</p>
<p>go every other day</p>
<p>you know one meal every other day that</p>
<p>might be hard but</p>
<p>um some people need to do that</p>
<p>especially if they have very strong or a</p>
<p>problem with insulin resistance and then</p>
<p>of course scan your foods to make sure</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no hidden carbs and then add the</p>
<p>exercise into that and usually that will</p>
<p>help you I have a lot of videos on</p>
<p>Plateau there&rsquo;s additional things you</p>
<p>can do but regardless of what your</p>
<p>situation is you can always improve it</p>
<p>if you are creative and look at um</p>
<p>actions to improve this insulin problem</p>
<p>very good doc did you know that</p>
<p>Switzerland has YouTube of all things</p>
<p>and to prove it&rsquo;s Sonya from Switzerland</p>
<p>on YouTube have you made any videos</p>
<p>about treating sarcoidosis and its</p>
<p>causes</p>
<p>um good question no I have not done any</p>
<p>videos in sarcoidosis</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s some interesting data</p>
<p>relating to vitamin D and Sarcoidosis</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna in fact you know what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>writing this down right now I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>actually do a video on sarcoidosis</p>
<p>wonderful okay uh Pierre Muhammad from</p>
<p>YouTube please share your advice on how</p>
<p>to avoid constipation while fasting and</p>
<p>omad</p>
<p>that relates to the microbiome okay so</p>
<p>if you have constipation when you fast</p>
<p>then you need to be taking a probiotic</p>
<p>because somehow you ended up with a</p>
<p>an insufficiency or just an official</p>
<p>insufficient amount of microbes in your</p>
<p>gut you just need more and um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re what you&rsquo;re dealing</p>
<p>with but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know so it&rsquo;s weird it&rsquo;s weird some</p>
<p>people have diarrhea when they do</p>
<p>fasting other people have constipation</p>
<p>other people have normal bowel movements</p>
<p>but over time if you&rsquo;re doing prolonged</p>
<p>fasting the question is why are you</p>
<p>still having bowel movements the third</p>
<p>or the fourth day well</p>
<p>your body is uh still</p>
<p>um getting fuel and you&rsquo;re having going</p>
<p>through what&rsquo;s called autophagy so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing a lot of recycling of</p>
<p>things and you are so you are consuming</p>
<p>certain things and that can show up in</p>
<p>your waist but um also it does take a</p>
<p>considerable amount of time to really</p>
<p>flesh out that colon completely which is</p>
<p>a really good thing periodically</p>
<p>okay very good</p>
<p>all right well the audience has leapt</p>
<p>right on it as usual and the question</p>
<p>was true false poor can be fat contained</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>monosaturated fat uh like in olive oil</p>
<p>and avocado oil and 85 percent of them</p>
<p>say that it&rsquo;s true and fifteen percent</p>
<p>are holding out uh indicating that they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t believe it at all</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s interesting because we we</p>
<p>really pushed the monounsaturated fats</p>
<p>as being the best fat it&rsquo;s heart healthy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an anti-inflammatory</p>
<p>um and stay away from the saturated fats</p>
<p>well guess what</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>lard and Tallow 50</p>
<p>monounsaturated fats so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s just a fact look it up but uh</p>
<p>apparently um these healthy fats are in</p>
<p>things that what are considered</p>
<p>unhealthy which actually they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>unless the quality you know I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>talking about getting your lard or</p>
<p>Tallow from the factory farms that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely not what I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>all right very good and here&rsquo;s a um a</p>
<p>grim a question Karen from uh YouTube</p>
<p>has stage four liver cancer we&rsquo;re sorry</p>
<p>Karen about that anything she can be</p>
<p>doing now</p>
<p>yeah I would I would get on a very</p>
<p>strict fasting protocol</p>
<p>um and I would watch all my videos on</p>
<p>the on the cancer but start fasting</p>
<p>immediately and I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>prolonged fasting like a week two weeks</p>
<p>three weeks the more severe the cancer</p>
<p>the longer you have to fast</p>
<p>unfortunately the problem is</p>
<p>do you have enough fat to do this and um</p>
<p>some people don&rsquo;t want to do it because</p>
<p>they might get too skinny but my thought</p>
<p>is you know what if it&rsquo;s the most potent</p>
<p>thing you can do as an anti-cancer</p>
<p>action I&rsquo;d be willing to get skinnier</p>
<p>and very thin if it saved my life so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a really important thing but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some other protocols that you</p>
<p>can watch as well</p>
<p>okay very good and as always happens we</p>
<p>have some different people that are</p>
<p>jealous not to have been mentioned and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in Sri Lanka is watching the</p>
<p>Philippines Nepal Brazil Latvia</p>
<p>Bangladesh Spain Portugal and Kazakhstan</p>
<p>and North Koreans are a little shy so</p>
<p>they haven&rsquo;t chimed in yet but we&rsquo;ll uh</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll hold a space for them and the</p>
<p>Congo all right let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>oh listen Terry says that notification</p>
<p>alerts are coming from my phone I hope</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not but uh Terry I&rsquo;m going to watch</p>
<p>out for that Terry insists that the</p>
<p>audience get the very best experience</p>
<p>out of the show and he&rsquo;s always on me</p>
<p>Tony from Facebook I&rsquo;ve lost 30 pounds</p>
<p>on healthy keto and intermittent fasting</p>
<p>but how do I lose the loose skin I&rsquo;m 62</p>
<p>years old</p>
<p>well I would focus more on</p>
<p>um a lot more exercise I would do</p>
<p>periodic prolonged fasting to strengthen</p>
<p>the skin through the anti-aging effect</p>
<p>and also the removal of some of these um</p>
<p>damaged collagen fibers it is a</p>
<p>situation if you lose a lot of weight</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have some loose skin and</p>
<p>some people try these other things and</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t work so they&rsquo;re gonna they do</p>
<p>surgery so it&rsquo;s kind of a depends on</p>
<p>on how how much sleep skin you have but</p>
<p>um the idea to try first is to try to</p>
<p>look at the skin as an organ and um</p>
<p>hopefully some of this will come back to</p>
<p>a normal Tone If you are focusing on</p>
<p>getting healthy versus just trying to</p>
<p>lose weight</p>
<p>okay very good I&rsquo;m not John from</p>
<p>Facebook why do I feel so sore during my</p>
<p>fasting periods</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>um it could be it could be because you</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>are you have inflammation you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>taking Omega-3</p>
<p>it could be that maybe you&rsquo;re exercising</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not recovering long enough I just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have enough data to know exactly</p>
<p>very good let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um oh here&rsquo;s something from uh Barger</p>
<p>hold on my thing just my screen just</p>
<p>shot down let me race back up to that</p>
<p>oh here he is uh barked your bird from</p>
<p>YouTube I&rsquo;m 42 six foot one 208 pounds</p>
<p>trying to work my way down to 150 85</p>
<p>with omad how do I bulk up with just</p>
<p>omad so he wants to maintain some muscle</p>
<p>I guess as he loses it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s purely</p>
<p>going to be a reflection of um</p>
<p>your workout</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re going to have to work out with</p>
<p>heavier weights uh sure uh less reps to</p>
<p>the point of fatigue and that way you</p>
<p>can maintain the muscles you can&rsquo;t grow</p>
<p>your muscles by not exercising exercise</p>
<p>is the uh the only way you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be able to actually</p>
<p>enlarge your muscles</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the cool thing when you do</p>
<p>keto and you do intermittent fasting it</p>
<p>protects the loss of muscle there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>certain things that protect the loss of</p>
<p>muscle which is a kind of a survival</p>
<p>mechanism so if you do this and you add</p>
<p>a good workout program where you</p>
<p>actually really</p>
<p>stimulate those muscles with the</p>
<p>intensity that is needed they will</p>
<p>enlarge and especially of course you</p>
<p>have to feed them the right things too</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what I would do if I were you</p>
<p>okay very good I tell you what let&rsquo;s put</p>
<p>up another question</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>see if I did that</p>
<p>and here it is Doc another long one but</p>
<p>this is a not a true falser</p>
<p>Okay so</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s an interesting question if</p>
<p>saturated fats</p>
<p>are good on keto and they&rsquo;re recommended</p>
<p>on the keto diet</p>
<p>then why do most studies link high fat</p>
<p>diets to bad Health outcomes like heart</p>
<p>disease and chronic illness</p>
<p>okay audience climb on that and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just go straight over to Julie she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coming to us from St Louis Missouri I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t even get a chance to unmute but</p>
<p>hopefully you&rsquo;re ahead of me Julie go</p>
<p>ahead with your questions</p>
<p>hi so I&rsquo;m asking this question from a</p>
<p>place of discouragement and depletion so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to figure out I hear you talk</p>
<p>about keto and fasting and I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m a good candidate because I have</p>
<p>three health conditions that I think are</p>
<p>related possibly</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s endometriosis anemia and MTHFR</p>
<p>and I feel depleted already so I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see how not eating or being very</p>
<p>confused about what to eat yeah I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>assuming that you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>um the methyl forms of B12 and folate</p>
<p>right you&rsquo;re doing that right</p>
<p>you have a really hard time swallowing</p>
<p>pills but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s trying</p>
<p>okay good so that will handle that</p>
<p>genetic problem and then you&rsquo;ll start to</p>
<p>be able to convert folate and that</p>
<p>should help</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the other thing is that a lot of times</p>
<p>when people find out they have that</p>
<p>genetic problem they don&rsquo;t they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get a full DNA test I don&rsquo;t know if you</p>
<p>had the full DNA test to look at other</p>
<p>things like you may need choline or you</p>
<p>may need a couple other things did you</p>
<p>get the full thing or did you just get</p>
<p>tests for that one gene</p>
<p>I did have a full genetic test but I</p>
<p>know I have both like I&rsquo;m it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>homogeneous or whatever I have both of</p>
<p>them but I don&rsquo;t know if I need to take</p>
<p>something else too okay well just to the</p>
<p>fact that um</p>
<p>you know if you get a good someone good</p>
<p>some a good evaluator to evaluate your</p>
<p>DNA test there might be some other</p>
<p>things you might need help with for</p>
<p>example</p>
<p>um there could be a problem with um</p>
<p>choline vitamin D and things like that</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m assuming your anemia is probably</p>
<p>coming from that B12 problem but it</p>
<p>could also be coming from Iron</p>
<p>um I mean if you think about it</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the best source of iron and b12</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m talking about the the correct</p>
<p>B12 that you need it&rsquo;s red meat and</p>
<p>liver of course so that would be on the</p>
<p>ketogenic plan</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s really no benefits to</p>
<p>carbohydrates for your problem there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no benefits in fact if you lower your</p>
<p>carbohydrates it won&rsquo;t worsen</p>
<p>endometriosis or anemia or your genetic</p>
<p>problems so I don&rsquo;t I think you are a</p>
<p>candidate for this you&rsquo;ll probably feel</p>
<p>a lot better if you do it but you</p>
<p>probably just need to</p>
<p>when you eat consume foods rich in the</p>
<p>B12 and the folate and also the folate</p>
<p>you can get from the dark leafy and</p>
<p>green vegetables which is on the plan so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to help you and it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>going to help greatly reduce your</p>
<p>endometriosis you just have to avoid</p>
<p>like Dairy which is more of a stimulator</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>some of these growth factors as well as</p>
<p>other types of</p>
<p>things that might have estrogen that can</p>
<p>be stirring up the endometriosis as well</p>
<p>I think you could I really think you</p>
<p>would do a lot better if you added those</p>
<p>two things to your plan with the three</p>
<p>conditions you have</p>
<p>um but then again also find someone that</p>
<p>can evaluate your DNA to</p>
<p>see if there&rsquo;s any other factors that</p>
<p>could be a problem because that one gene</p>
<p>you mentioned is real popular but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many other things that are</p>
<p>genetically has genetic variants that</p>
<p>can be messing you up</p>
<p>foreign</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great okay Julie we&rsquo;re rooting for</p>
<p>you and we&rsquo;d love to hear back with some</p>
<p>more progress you certainly seem so</p>
<p>interested in your health I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to find a path forward so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific let&rsquo;s see um</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;ve heard from a</p>
<p>lot of people and it scares them away</p>
<p>from fasting Maggie from YouTube I want</p>
<p>to start fasting but I start trembling</p>
<p>and feel weak when I don&rsquo;t eat for an</p>
<p>extended time how can I get to omad when</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m struggling physically</p>
<p>it sounds to me that this is a a blood</p>
<p>sugar issue because for some reason</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re um</p>
<p>doing it too fast because if you if you</p>
<p>jump into keto and you just like okay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna I&rsquo;m gonna go on a</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know maybe an 18-hour fast and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve never done it before</p>
<p>um that might be too high of a step so</p>
<p>you want to kind of gradually go into it</p>
<p>you know and let your body adapt at its</p>
<p>own pace and then make sure when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>um higher amounts of carbs try to keep</p>
<p>those carbs really low</p>
<p>um and because if you do the</p>
<p>intermittent fasting with a higher</p>
<p>amount of carbs</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s going to take longer to adapt</p>
<p>um and get into keto and that low blood</p>
<p>sugar situation</p>
<p>um will be harder to resolve but</p>
<p>if you go to my um</p>
<p>website Dr byrd.com and you click videos</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll have video One watch this first</p>
<p>and then start watching these videos in</p>
<p>order so you can learn the correct way</p>
<p>to gradually go into this so there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>problems I&rsquo;m not suggesting this of</p>
<p>Maggie but first the longest time for</p>
<p>years and years and years there&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>probably great momentum and people say</p>
<p>oh no no you must eat something light</p>
<p>every hour or two hours so you go crazy</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you know whatever you&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>nervous and stuff and and for some</p>
<p>people that might be true but I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s become sort of a mantra and I sort</p>
<p>of believe that I thought I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>possibly go uh you know 22 hours with</p>
<p>eating oh yes I can it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>life-changing for me so I&rsquo;m glad I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t listen to those voices uh Beyond</p>
<p>Reason</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably the worst advice you can</p>
<p>be given is to eat a little bit every so</p>
<p>often it&rsquo;s not good it&rsquo;s not good it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not natural because you what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing is you&rsquo;re just boosting insulin so</p>
<p>you feel good and then you&rsquo;re basically</p>
<p>jacking up insulin over over a period of</p>
<p>time and now you end up with</p>
<p>um now you&rsquo;re running basically on your</p>
<p>sugar fuel you&rsquo;re not running on fat and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a healthy thing to constantly</p>
<p>be tapping into your glycogen reserve</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p>you know you never get into the fat</p>
<p>burning and so that creates a lot of</p>
<p>other problems for you bad advice don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do it especially if you have</p>
<p>hypoglycemia</p>
<p>exactly what I&rsquo;ll tell you what is</p>
<p>healthy and that&rsquo;s our audience&rsquo;s</p>
<p>response to our various questions</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve already got an answer on the</p>
<p>second one which was a question this</p>
<p>time as saturated fats are good on keto</p>
<p>diet then why do most studies link a</p>
<p>high fat diet to bad Health outcomes</p>
<p>like heart disease and chronic illness</p>
<p>and drum roll please fifty percent of</p>
<p>our respondents say it has to do with</p>
<p>the quality of the fats 40 say the</p>
<p>studies do not exclude carbs and which</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard before from you Doc and 10</p>
<p>say</p>
<p>the test patients had high triglycerides</p>
<p>okay well 100</p>
<p>of all these studies</p>
<p>um don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t differentiate uh this one</p>
<p>thing okay</p>
<p>um the high fat diet they just kind of</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>all of them are also on the same same</p>
<p>time doing a high carb diet and that</p>
<p>includes the animal studies as well and</p>
<p>so um if you have a high fat and a high</p>
<p>carb diet how do you know the bad</p>
<p>outcomes aren&rsquo;t from the high carb</p>
<p>versus the high fat you don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s two two variables you</p>
<p>have to isolate them and so the the</p>
<p>study there is a study of like one that</p>
<p>shows that if you um they compare the</p>
<p>high fat</p>
<p>um versus uh I&rsquo;m sorry a low fat versus</p>
<p>um a low carb and they found the low</p>
<p>carb is the the significant factor into</p>
<p>regulating whether Fat&rsquo;s bad or fats</p>
<p>good as far as the outcome</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>these studies</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you assume that they&rsquo;re keto because</p>
<p>they say high fat but they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually not keto when you go</p>
<p>high carb so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s kind of the</p>
<p>Omission they don&rsquo;t talk about the carbs</p>
<p>in this equation and they just say oh</p>
<p>high fat yeah right so well show me a</p>
<p>study that really isolates the</p>
<p>difference and uh and then show me the</p>
<p>outcome I&rsquo;d love to see if someone could</p>
<p>go ahead and show me one study</p>
<p>um I could not find any</p>
<p>interesting yes our test subjects are on</p>
<p>pepperoni pizza which has a lot of high</p>
<p>fat and they&rsquo;re all dying so yeah see</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s see now let&rsquo;s go on to another</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>uh Christy from Facebook I have</p>
<p>pancreatitis ouch and I am trying</p>
<p>carnivore been on it for about a month</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m still feeling really tired what</p>
<p>can I do to help with her lack of energy</p>
<p>well make sure when you do the carnival</p>
<p>you do the um like the healthy version</p>
<p>um like nose to tail like also add you</p>
<p>know fish and you probably have to add</p>
<p>some supplements to this as well to make</p>
<p>sure you&rsquo;re getting like vitamin C</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hard to get when you&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>carnivore but there&rsquo;s one thing that I</p>
<p>think I would recommend for pancreatitis</p>
<p>um usually okay usually there&rsquo;s a kind</p>
<p>of a blockage in the the ducks that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple bile ducts that kind of</p>
<p>go Branch off into the gallbladder and</p>
<p>Branch off into the pancreas</p>
<p>so if you were to go online and search</p>
<p>tadka you can search on Amazon stuff and</p>
<p>buy that product called tadka that is a</p>
<p>certain type of bile salt that will kind</p>
<p>of open up that duct and free up the</p>
<p>flow</p>
<p>out of your pancreas</p>
<p>um and that way the inflammation may</p>
<p>just come down so that&rsquo;s a really good</p>
<p>remedy for pancreatitis is called tatka</p>
<p>okay very good not just not just good</p>
<p>for your gallbladder and your liver but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good for the pancreas all right and</p>
<p>Dr Berg&rsquo;s always beating up insulin but</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t have it out for it as is</p>
<p>evidence in this next question</p>
<p>okay here&rsquo;s a question if High insulin</p>
<p>is so bad for us okay High insulin is so</p>
<p>bad for us</p>
<p>um then why does insulin</p>
<p>improve dementia like they&rsquo;ll have a</p>
<p>nasal sprays of insulin that you can</p>
<p>spray up into your nose and it&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>for Dimension Alzheimer&rsquo;s why does it</p>
<p>improve muscle growth like even</p>
<p>bodybuilders use it to grow their</p>
<p>muscles and why does it even lower</p>
<p>inflammation lower your bad cholesterol</p>
<p>and even raise your testosterone</p>
<p>wow let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s see what you</p>
<p>have what you have to say about that I</p>
<p>mean I have a lot of videos on insulin</p>
<p>um so but I wanted to see what you guys</p>
<p>think about this question okay and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see what Carol has to think about her</p>
<p>health uh Carol I&rsquo;m unmuting you I hope</p>
<p>you do the same and looking for your one</p>
<p>question for Dr Burr go ahead Carol</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ve been uh I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>pre-diabetes for a couple of years and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing intermittent fasting two</p>
<p>meals a day and I exercise and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>really working hard on keto and I have a</p>
<p>CGM I&rsquo;ve been using for the last 16</p>
<p>weeks and all my all my readings in the</p>
<p>morning when I get up are like 100 110</p>
<p>120 130 for my glucose monitor so I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what else to do</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re not eating any sugar but your</p>
<p>but your blood sugars are high in the</p>
<p>morning right yes yeah and and</p>
<p>you know this relates to the next</p>
<p>question so I&rsquo;m going to kind of give</p>
<p>you a little bit and then we&rsquo;ll give you</p>
<p>more in a minute</p>
<p>um but what&rsquo;s happening is</p>
<p>your liver is making glucose</p>
<p>out of not from carbohydrates not from</p>
<p>the diet not from your diet it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>making extra sugar</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>you know um you know what I&rsquo;m gonna save</p>
<p>this question once people know because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give away the answer to</p>
<p>this this next question it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>relate to your questions so I tell you</p>
<p>what hang tight let&rsquo;s see what people</p>
<p>say and then I&rsquo;m going to answer your</p>
<p>question because it&rsquo;s going to be a very</p>
<p>simple solution and um you&rsquo;ll no longer</p>
<p>be in a mystery about it</p>
<p>how exciting Carol this question is for</p>
<p>you is for you so stand by don&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>anywhere because you&rsquo;re going to hear</p>
<p>this the great news that comes out of</p>
<p>that so uh let&rsquo;s see that&rsquo;s terrific</p>
<p>thanks for coming on with us and why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we just jump into another one uh</p>
<p>uh whose comment may not be question</p>
<p>related and that&rsquo;s going to be Jesse</p>
<p>from Worcester uh and I&rsquo;m so proud of</p>
<p>saying it right even though it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>spelled that way and Jesse you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>with Dr Burke he&rsquo;s muted</p>
<p>oh unmute yourselves there okay good</p>
<p>oops still can&rsquo;t hear you</p>
<p>Jesse check your settings</p>
<p>hello</p>
<p>try again Jesse</p>
<p>nope we don&rsquo;t have yet I&rsquo;m going to put</p>
<p>you on hold as you figure that out so to</p>
<p>speak and let&rsquo;s go back</p>
<p>um to how about</p>
<p>Dr Berg he&rsquo;s always popular to have on</p>
<p>the screen and then we&rsquo;ll add another</p>
<p>question from uh from our social media</p>
<p>folks Tay from YouTube why do I feel so</p>
<p>weak like I&rsquo;m going to faint during</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s another one oh Madden</p>
<p>fasting so</p>
<p>there we go yeah well uh I hope you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking your electrolytes okay and uh</p>
<p>that includes sea salt as well</p>
<p>sea salt uh is important as well as the</p>
<p>potassium</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ve been experimenting on</p>
<p>electrolytes recently and um uh I</p>
<p>started to kind of beef up no pun</p>
<p>intended more potassium like more than</p>
<p>usual it&rsquo;s very interesting apparently</p>
<p>in my body</p>
<p>um just has just so much extra energy so</p>
<p>noticing my workouts I&rsquo;m like wow where</p>
<p>is all this energy coming from then I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like oh that&rsquo;s right I just took a lot</p>
<p>of potassium so</p>
<p>um yeah sometimes it&rsquo;s good to</p>
<p>experiment but if you don&rsquo;t have enough</p>
<p>potassium magnesium or the sea salts</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be a little light-headed</p>
<p>okay Elena from YouTube what do you</p>
<p>recommend for someone with type 1</p>
<p>diabetes is there a natural way to</p>
<p>promote insulin production</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if you have a true autoimmune disease</p>
<p>you know you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>um unfortunately the beta cells that are</p>
<p>working enough to produce insulin but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a handful of people that</p>
<p>have type one that apparently</p>
<p>you know it came from having type 2 and</p>
<p>then it kind of just wore out so in</p>
<p>those cases I think there is something</p>
<p>you can do but it really depends on how</p>
<p>long you&rsquo;ve had it and how bad it is but</p>
<p>that being said</p>
<p>um if you uh</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you have some function left of</p>
<p>that that beta cell there&rsquo;s all sorts of</p>
<p>things you can do to improve it apple</p>
<p>cider vinegar and water can improve the</p>
<p>output also you can improve the um</p>
<p>um from Berber rain and cinnamon and</p>
<p>potassium and chromium and all these</p>
<p>things are really good for blood sugars</p>
<p>but of course the basic knowledge is</p>
<p>going on low carb and doing intermittent</p>
<p>fasting will help you but some of the</p>
<p>answer also is going to be answered in</p>
<p>that question that everyone&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>chewing on so stay tuned for a little</p>
<p>bit more on that very good Jesse how you</p>
<p>doing with us sir let me see if we can</p>
<p>hear you yet speak to us</p>
<p>no still have an audio issue you might</p>
<p>take your headphones off and unplug that</p>
<p>kick off the headphones</p>
<p>and unplug it from the thing let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>if we can hear you talk to me please oh</p>
<p>poor guy keep working on it Jesse we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to let you go</p>
<p>uh we&rsquo;re gonna keep working on that</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see so let&rsquo;s go back to social</p>
<p>media</p>
<p>uh Nadia not excuse me from Facebook or</p>
<p>YouTube I have constant pain under my</p>
<p>right shoulder blade can you help me</p>
<p>with what this indicates</p>
<p>yes I can help you that is a classic</p>
<p>um either liver or gallbladder or bile</p>
<p>duct problem in which case</p>
<p>um uh this means that you need to</p>
<p>kind of loosen up the sludge that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>building up through these tubes that</p>
<p>connect things and the best way to do</p>
<p>that is through that tadka I mentioned</p>
<p>before I&rsquo;d say type of bile salt that</p>
<p>helps the flow through those channels</p>
<p>you want to take to an empty stomach in</p>
<p>the morning and then two and then empty</p>
<p>stomach in the afternoon you can also do</p>
<p>it with other bile salts as well so it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to be taka but um the point</p>
<p>is that this tells us that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>your bile is lacking your your your</p>
<p>gallbladder um</p>
<p>bile collectively is lactating the bile</p>
<p>salt so you need more of that to get it</p>
<p>to flow better from your liver down into</p>
<p>the gallbladder and that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>refer pain to underneath your um</p>
<p>scapula on the right side and right into</p>
<p>the rhomboids</p>
<p>okay the usual suspect a good old</p>
<p>insulin uh if High insulin is so bad for</p>
<p>us then why does insulin improve</p>
<p>dementia muscle growth lower</p>
<p>inflammation lower LDL which is the bad</p>
<p>stuff and even raise your testosterone</p>
<p>levels which all the boys like uh in the</p>
<p>audience said 80 percent of them say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s beneficial to regulate sugar and</p>
<p>carbs and regulates full functions of</p>
<p>the brain and the muscles 20 percent say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a vital hormone in the production</p>
<p>of glucogenesis these are some big</p>
<p>answers I&rsquo;ll tell you</p>
<p>well let&rsquo;s just take that last that</p>
<p>point</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>insulin</p>
<p>actually and this will relates to the</p>
<p>lady&rsquo;s question that we mentioned</p>
<p>insulin actually</p>
<p>um suppresses</p>
<p>gluconeogenesis the formation of sugar</p>
<p>right so if she&rsquo;s waking up in the</p>
<p>morning with</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>high blood glucose then that means she</p>
<p>must have a deficiency of insulin now</p>
<p>wait a second</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t we told that um hyperinsulinemia</p>
<p>which is this high level of insulin in</p>
<p>the blood is a is basically</p>
<p>creating problems creating problems for</p>
<p>people</p>
<p>yes that&rsquo;s true and a lot of people have</p>
<p>that problem but this one little factor</p>
<p>is called insulin resistance and this</p>
<p>has everything to do with the receptor</p>
<p>of insulin the receptor so the receptor</p>
<p>is what controls everything it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the controlling factor and when you have</p>
<p>resistance or a blockage or a problem</p>
<p>with the receptor</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re consuming too many carbs</p>
<p>and increasing high levels of insulin</p>
<p>over a period of years</p>
<p>now you are insulin deficient so all of</p>
<p>the symptoms of insulin resistance are</p>
<p>really in reality a deficiency of</p>
<p>insulin which is fascinating so we</p>
<p>always think about wow the</p>
<p>hyperinsulinemia is causing the dementia</p>
<p>the Alzheimer&rsquo;s the this to that it is</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the high level it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the low level on the other end</p>
<p>of the communication that&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>so we do need insulin desperately to fix</p>
<p>all these problems but in the right</p>
<p>amounts</p>
<p>but the way to fix it is not to eat to</p>
<p>raise the insulin because then you</p>
<p>created a resistance problem so this is</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s really hard to understand this</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s you don&rsquo;t understand about</p>
<p>the adaptation the body considers it</p>
<p>toxic so it&rsquo;s going to start to inhibit</p>
<p>the absorption and</p>
<p>um but if you really understand that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the lack of insulin and the way to</p>
<p>fix that is by cutting your carbs down</p>
<p>over time going and fasting and so with</p>
<p>this particular person who has wakes up</p>
<p>with high blood glucose</p>
<p>she just needs to optimize and do a</p>
<p>little bit more for for insulin</p>
<p>resistance to fix that and that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be the adding of the berberine the</p>
<p>apple cider vinegar more chromium zinc</p>
<p>vitamin D potassium foods and then give</p>
<p>it more time</p>
<p>not to mention exercise and give it more</p>
<p>time until that blood glucose comes down</p>
<p>that is the solution because then you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>actually fix the insulin resistance</p>
<p>and then the last question</p>
<p>that you just uh mentioned by someone on</p>
<p>the social media can you refresh my</p>
<p>memory what that was about um Steve if</p>
<p>you remember because that also related</p>
<p>to this question let&rsquo;s see yeah it was</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for it now had something to</p>
<p>do with insulin correct uh Irene Cindy</p>
<p>it Roars up so fast that it&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>difficult Terry can you uh jog my memory</p>
<p>with that let me look</p>
<p>um I think it was memory loss I think we</p>
<p>both have uh deficiency of it and</p>
<p>Insulin because of our memory loss yeah</p>
<p>what do I need for that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>well the point is that this this is</p>
<p>interesting because we we just think</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>um wow insulin is just killing us no no</p>
<p>actually it&rsquo;s a deficiency but if you</p>
<p>have the right amount of insulin you</p>
<p>grow your muscles you get rid of</p>
<p>inflammation your brain works</p>
<p>um your blood sugars stay in uh in good</p>
<p>check uh and um your liver stops making</p>
<p>all this extra sugar so so you know the</p>
<p>video like I&rsquo;m going to release a video</p>
<p>on this topic can really make it so</p>
<p>simple to understand but it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>fascinating</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Paradox that will be cleared up when you</p>
<p>see this video okay very good and by the</p>
<p>way very organized website you go to</p>
<p>drburg.com and as he said watch this</p>
<p>first and so on but if uh if you want to</p>
<p>have a more</p>
<p>um remote way of doing it I want to</p>
<p>encourage you all to get Dr Burke&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great app it&rsquo;s good for Android or Apple</p>
<p>and so on and that will give you the</p>
<p>same availability to those great videos</p>
<p>as the website itself so go grab that</p>
<p>right away and uh let&rsquo;s see what do we</p>
<p>have now</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go to another question this one</p>
<p>Tay from YouTube why do I feel so weak</p>
<p>and like I&rsquo;m going to faint during omad</p>
<p>and fasting did I already asked that I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think so but you probably already</p>
<p>asked that Steve so um but we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>answer it again for some time it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically it&rsquo;s going to be um sea salt</p>
<p>electrolytes that is the that is going</p>
<p>to be the secret</p>
<p>okay very good now here&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>fascinating doc a true falser</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>okinawans okay now they&rsquo;re considered</p>
<p>the people who live the longest</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s a part of Japan</p>
<p>consume more pork and meat and less fish</p>
<p>than other Japanese</p>
<p>is that true or false</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting you&rsquo;re living a long</p>
<p>time they&rsquo;re doing something right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for sure and so climb on that</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see Elizabeth wants to know a doc</p>
<p>from YouTube can I take an iodine</p>
<p>supplement while on thyroid medication</p>
<p>of course check with your doctor it</p>
<p>really depends if you have Hashimoto&rsquo;s</p>
<p>or not if you which is very common if</p>
<p>you have Hashimoto&rsquo;s iodine might not be</p>
<p>what you need you may need more selenium</p>
<p>okay but I guess you just need to really</p>
<p>understand where the problem is is it in</p>
<p>the conversion from T4 to T3 is it</p>
<p>coming from an autoimmune or is it</p>
<p>coming from too much estrogen or is it</p>
<p>just an unknown thing that uh you know</p>
<p>your deficient item because your diet is</p>
<p>low in iodine that could be another</p>
<p>factor it&rsquo;s just one of those things you</p>
<p>have to kind of um</p>
<p>you know isolate</p>
<p>um what could be the reason I mean you</p>
<p>could have a deficiency of iodine but</p>
<p>not necessarily</p>
<p>okay very good we&rsquo;re frustrated with</p>
<p>Jeff see Jesse talked to me for a second</p>
<p>because we did have him we could hear</p>
<p>him early on but we can&rsquo;t now no we</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t Jesse I see a there we go oh my</p>
<p>God there we are we can&rsquo;t hold on I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to put you up on this I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>what happened it was about and at least</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t seem to mute it but</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>so my my uh my question to you would be</p>
<p>in regards to</p>
<p>um a few years ago I ended up getting uh</p>
<p>I started getting some birth symptoms</p>
<p>and then with headaches and then I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been diagnosed with H pylori and then it</p>
<p>slowly progressed and became stay back</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>um which</p>
<p>I was about 220 pounds</p>
<p>and I was still healthy going to the gym</p>
<p>regularly and then uh I I had a</p>
<p>recession or my symptoms gone away in my</p>
<p>interview levels and I sleep with better</p>
<p>after two weeks of probiotics then I got</p>
<p>to be diagnosed with H5 after</p>
<p>eradicating</p>
<p>um and then now I&rsquo;ve not lost 40 pounds</p>
<p>in this uh sleep apnea came back</p>
<p>um is it possible uh social testing a</p>
<p>Genoa test</p>
<p>level 10. um</p>
<p>which I test four months ago</p>
<p>is it possible</p>
<p>okay good and of course um sorry for all</p>
<p>the sound and static it was really hard</p>
<p>to hear but I hear I got what you said</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>um so he has he been losing weight he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been having problems with uh the balance</p>
<p>of his microbiome as dysbiosis and he</p>
<p>has H pylori H pylori is a microbe in</p>
<p>our our stomachs like 80 of the</p>
<p>population has it or more</p>
<p>um but usually it&rsquo;s silent usually it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of uh it&rsquo;s not unfriendly it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>friendly it just kind of sits there and</p>
<p>just co-exists right but it&rsquo;s not until</p>
<p>the environment changes that it kind of</p>
<p>comes out and kicks you when you&rsquo;re down</p>
<p>and especially if the pH in your stomach</p>
<p>um becomes less acid and one of the</p>
<p>survival mechanisms of H pylori is that</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>it makes ammonia then what is ammonia</p>
<p>ammonia is the substance that is so</p>
<p>alkaline I think on the pH scale it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 11. it&rsquo;s like way up there and it</p>
<p>does that to survive so it makes your</p>
<p>stomach very alkaline and you can</p>
<p>probably even sometimes with some people</p>
<p>uh smell like an ammonia breath</p>
<p>and that can also occur with candida</p>
<p>candida does the same thing so you make</p>
<p>this ammonia and that that way it</p>
<p>survives right so</p>
<p>um how do we solve this problem well um</p>
<p>there is a really good remedy for h</p>
<p>pylori and um</p>
<p>H pylori is a microbe and plants</p>
<p>naturally have developed all sorts of uh</p>
<p>defenses against</p>
<p>microbes and pathogens and one of the</p>
<p>defense mechanisms that plants develop</p>
<p>is sulforaphane</p>
<p>sulforaphane so you can actually grab</p>
<p>that sulforaphane from plants like in</p>
<p>broccoli Sprouts or you can get it</p>
<p>isolated in something called dim</p>
<p>from cruciferous and that is really good</p>
<p>to wipe out H pylori and put it back</p>
<p>into remission and keep it in check</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been really good for h pylori and</p>
<p>then also start to acidify the stomach</p>
<p>unless you have gastritis that&rsquo;s too bad</p>
<p>which in which case you need to you know</p>
<p>heal it first with the zinc and other</p>
<p>things until it gets better one of the</p>
<p>vegetables that seems to be okay with</p>
<p>gastritis out of all the vegetables is</p>
<p>cabbage and cabbages has sulforaphane</p>
<p>too so these are just kind of tips that</p>
<p>I would recommend</p>
<p>um but of course I would also not just</p>
<p>take a probiotic but I would try to take</p>
<p>the best probiotics that you can find</p>
<p>which are the fermented foods maybe have</p>
<p>a little bit more of that if you could</p>
<p>do that that&rsquo;s like way better than just</p>
<p>a typical probiotic</p>
<p>and really high quality</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>food that&rsquo;s from Farmers that grow these</p>
<p>maybe microgreens that are grown on soil</p>
<p>that have a very high level uh natural</p>
<p>microbiome in their plant leaves</p>
<p>themselves that would also help to seed</p>
<p>the gut</p>
<p>um but I think that um Your solution is</p>
<p>going to be</p>
<p>to really keep working on the gut to</p>
<p>support that and to get the pH of the</p>
<p>stomach normal and then to use the</p>
<p>sulforaphane to kill out the microbes</p>
<p>and if you have sibo I think this will</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to probably</p>
<p>you know it might not work to have some</p>
<p>of this fiber so then you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have to just do carnivores so it really</p>
<p>I just kind of gave you some things to</p>
<p>work with to try to sort this out but um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all I have for you right now well</p>
<p>that was a full appointment doc you got</p>
<p>tons of information and uh Jesse listen</p>
<p>I want to urge you to listen to the uh</p>
<p>repeat on YouTube or Facebook you can</p>
<p>hear what Dr Berg his counsel and also</p>
<p>hear your hilarious robot voice that</p>
<p>came through with your report audio</p>
<p>system but we were able to get the gist</p>
<p>and we wish you a well in that regard so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s move on uh let&rsquo;s see to answers</p>
<p>from the last question and these uh</p>
<p>wonderful okinawans lived the longest</p>
<p>and they consume more pork and meat and</p>
<p>so and then fish than other Japanese so</p>
<p>why on Earth uh that&rsquo;s usually Spells at</p>
<p>least to Common uh propaganda ill health</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s see Point things are moving so</p>
<p>fast there it is a question 85 say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>true and fifteen percent say it is false</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually true um you know it&rsquo;s cons</p>
<p>um you know there&rsquo;s certain</p>
<p>books on like the Blue Zone and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>people talking about longevity and um</p>
<p>people that live over the age of 100 110</p>
<p>and they always kind of like link it to</p>
<p>well they&rsquo;re on plant-based well</p>
<p>apparently they&rsquo;re not especially the</p>
<p>okinawans they have more meat and more</p>
<p>fish</p>
<p>and even especially pork which is</p>
<p>supposed to be very bad for us then the</p>
<p>other</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Japanese</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s um they don&rsquo;t just do plants</p>
<p>they do fermented foods and they have</p>
<p>lower stress and they get more exercise</p>
<p>but as far as the meat they do have meat</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s interesting but not not all</p>
<p>fish so that is conflicting information</p>
<p>for a lot of people</p>
<p>but I will say the there&rsquo;s a difference</p>
<p>between the modern okinawans and the</p>
<p>traditional ones right the younger</p>
<p>okinawans probably are eating more of</p>
<p>American food so it&rsquo;s probably going to</p>
<p>affect the longevity versus the</p>
<p>traditional okinawans that um probably</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>as much of the spam</p>
<p>um if they used to have this like</p>
<p>sauteed vegetable dish with Spam which</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the best thing in</p>
<p>the world but uh I would avoid it</p>
<p>so anyway that&rsquo;s that answer and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sticking to it Steve okay very well the</p>
<p>final question of the day is very</p>
<p>interesting as were the rest and here it</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>all right which two nutrients um should</p>
<p>anyone who grinds their teeth</p>
<p>consume more of</p>
<p>very interesting we have one person left</p>
<p>in the green room and she is from La my</p>
<p>old stopping grounds her name is uh</p>
<p>Cindy and Cindy you are on for your one</p>
<p>question with Dr Berg</p>
<p>hi Dr Berg hello so for 27 almost years</p>
<p>ever since I gave birth to my daughter</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had super hot feet at night and no</p>
<p>matter what I do</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t get better and I don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>diabetes and I don&rsquo;t have pre-diabetes</p>
<p>which is what every time I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>look it up that&rsquo;s what they say oh</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got diabetes but I don&rsquo;t so</p>
<p>I also have</p>
<p>um nocturnal</p>
<p>um hypoxia and I was wondering if that</p>
<p>was related to it</p>
<p>um okay</p>
<p>wow everyone&rsquo;s complaining a cold feet</p>
<p>now you have the hot feet so you have to</p>
<p>you have to pick what problem you want</p>
<p>you want hot feet or cold feet and no no</p>
<p>I think what I would do is I would um I</p>
<p>would definitely uh focus more on the</p>
<p>liver there&rsquo;s one symptom of liver uh is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s people get hot feed and I think</p>
<p>this boils down to circulation so if you</p>
<p>have hypoxia then that probably relates</p>
<p>to the circulation and the pooling of</p>
<p>blood and heat down to the feet</p>
<p>so what I would do first and I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve already done this is</p>
<p>implement the basic eating plan that I</p>
<p>recommend which is the healthy keto and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and see if it goes</p>
<p>away but there&rsquo;s other things that I</p>
<p>would do too I would take a milk thistle</p>
<p>for the liver and I would also do things</p>
<p>to increase</p>
<p>circulation like a lot of exercise and</p>
<p>but I I think if you have hypoxia</p>
<p>um I I don&rsquo;t know I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>good history to really know exactly what</p>
<p>to do for that other than uh</p>
<p>um do things to support the vascular</p>
<p>system in your body one really good</p>
<p>nutrient would be um niacin and um</p>
<p>and also I do know this one last thing</p>
<p>that does help regulate temperature in</p>
<p>the body uh and this may help you help</p>
<p>you just take more B1</p>
<p>B1 tends to</p>
<p>um if you&rsquo;re too cold or too hot it</p>
<p>tends to</p>
<p>help regulate that from an interesting</p>
<p>angle so you might want to try that as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>okay very good well thank you so much</p>
<p>Cindy and I hope that that leads you</p>
<p>forward to some great uh conclusion over</p>
<p>that issue and let&rsquo;s see we&rsquo;re waiting</p>
<p>for our final question for the day we</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve done very well today oh here it is</p>
<p>no sooner do I ask than it pops up all</p>
<p>right and the interesting question was</p>
<p>which two nutrients should everyone who</p>
<p>grinds their teeth consume more of I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t wait to hear uh the six excuse me</p>
<p>65 say zinc and magnesium 15 say Vitamin</p>
<p>B and D 15 say calcium and D3 and 5 say</p>
<p>vitamin C and magnesium so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>couple folks adding magnesium into that</p>
<p>roxism is a apparently a very common</p>
<p>problem and people were these night</p>
<p>guards which is kind of a pain in the</p>
<p>butt because you&rsquo;re chewing on plastic</p>
<p>all night long</p>
<p>um but um it&rsquo;s a big deal because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>grinding your teeth down and then when</p>
<p>you do like you got to get new teeth so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the two vitamins and in a video that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to do this this uh release anyway</p>
<p>very soon I&rsquo;ll talk about the reason why</p>
<p>but the two vitamins are B1 and D3</p>
<p>um and both of those are involved in</p>
<p>supporting</p>
<p>the type of nervous system</p>
<p>that could be affecting you while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sleeping and that can actually settle</p>
<p>things down so if I had grinding of the</p>
<p>teeth I would be taking a little more B</p>
<p>B1 and D3 B4 bed to see if I can resolve</p>
<p>that and there&rsquo;s also an interesting</p>
<p>Associated increase in your pulse rate</p>
<p>um while you&rsquo;re grind grinding of course</p>
<p>you go hand in hand so that&rsquo;s part of</p>
<p>the sympathetic nervous system that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>being activated so</p>
<p>stay tuned for that video interesting</p>
<p>well everyone says I&rsquo;m dinging even Lori</p>
<p>came out and said I&rsquo;m dinging to do</p>
<p>something dinging maybe it&rsquo;s coming from</p>
<p>my computer but anyway if so I apologize</p>
<p>for dinging so much I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>remember to that oh there it just goes</p>
<p>again that&rsquo;s from you know what the</p>
<p>culprit is Terry every time he sends</p>
<p>another text it dings on my computer so</p>
<p>Karen you you share in the guilt uh but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to fix that that shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>going out over the air let&rsquo;s see so uh</p>
<p>and the show&rsquo;s almost over so you folks</p>
<p>only have to to put up with that for a</p>
<p>little bit more okay let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>Jason from Facebook good morning Dr Berg</p>
<p>if after 19 hours of fasting and your</p>
<p>stomach is going crazy uh should I give</p>
<p>in or still keep pushing through I can</p>
<p>imagine what you&rsquo;re going to say</p>
<p>I would push through because that&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>temporary that should go away when you</p>
<p>fully completely adapt to keto</p>
<p>um things should be really easy in your</p>
<p>your appetite should go away and I&rsquo;m I</p>
<p>think you said appetite that was right</p>
<p>was that correct Steve yes appetite yes</p>
<p>or yeah he&rsquo;s just he&rsquo;s dying to eat poor</p>
<p>guy&rsquo;s dying to eat</p>
<p>yeah so um but just make sure when you</p>
<p>eat you add more fat make sure when you</p>
<p>eat you do the healthy version of the</p>
<p>keto and don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t increase your carbs</p>
<p>so many people do fasting but they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do keto and uh they they have a hard</p>
<p>time fasting because the sugar is a</p>
<p>little too high so the lower the the</p>
<p>lower amount of carbs you can put in</p>
<p>that actual meal the easier it is going</p>
<p>to be to adapt and and fast and go</p>
<p>longer</p>
<p>without eating wonderful okay that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>uh oh Zoo from Facebook will healthy</p>
<p>keto help with MS</p>
<p>terrible condition</p>
<p>I think it will because you&rsquo;re running</p>
<p>their brain off of ketones ketones are</p>
<p>antioxidants they&rsquo;re anti-inflammatory</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what you need if you have MS</p>
<p>which is an autoimmune if I had Ms I</p>
<p>would be doing</p>
<p>two things right off the bat I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>doing longer fast and I would be doing a</p>
<p>lot of vitamin D and of course I would</p>
<p>be doing keto at the same time</p>
<p>okay very good and you you may you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another way that you can</p>
<p>increase your ketones on top of all</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>and that is to take actual ketones as a</p>
<p>supplement</p>
<p>if you have any type of um brain related</p>
<p>problem and then um you can also do MCT</p>
<p>oil too that&rsquo;ll actually increase the</p>
<p>ketones because if given the choice the</p>
<p>neurons will uh choose the ketones over</p>
<p>the glucose and so if you keep that in</p>
<p>your blood through the day a little bit</p>
<p>uh your your brain will be happy the</p>
<p>neurons will thank you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific thank you neurons that</p>
<p>is wonderful let&rsquo;s see why don&rsquo;t we talk</p>
<p>about the fact that not just in the</p>
<p>contiguous U.S is a place to buy your</p>
<p>great products but you&rsquo;re always working</p>
<p>to help people in other parts of the</p>
<p>world to get it affordably any new news</p>
<p>on that front</p>
<p>yeah I think you know we&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>trying to do that I</p>
<p>um I think we&rsquo;re getting into India</p>
<p>right now and uh if you there&rsquo;s a link</p>
<p>down below to see if we actually have</p>
<p>something in your area you can check it</p>
<p>out</p>
<p>um but I will say um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always you know I always like to</p>
<p>um promote or tell people about</p>
<p>companies that are producing good</p>
<p>products out there and I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>affiliated and I don&rsquo;t get Kickbacks or</p>
<p>anything like that but there&rsquo;s um a</p>
<p>company I&rsquo;ll put them down below in the</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>in the description</p>
<p>or Steve will in about five minutes once</p>
<p>I get the exact name of the company and</p>
<p>the website but they produce um a</p>
<p>hazelnut a hazelnut that um is not</p>
<p>rancid and it&rsquo;s even they have chocolate</p>
<p>and they have different flavors of this</p>
<p>coating and I and what I like about this</p>
<p>company</p>
<p>is they don&rsquo;t put all the the extra</p>
<p>little</p>
<p>you know dextrin and uh these tapioca</p>
<p>and corn fibers that so many other keto</p>
<p>people do and the importance of um</p>
<p>the fat you know out of all the nuts the</p>
<p>hazelnut I&rsquo;m sorry did I say hazelnut I</p>
<p>meant macadamia nuts okay</p>
<p>that is the best nut on keto because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so high in fat</p>
<p>um and then you have the pecan but the</p>
<p>hazelnuts</p>
<p>are macadamia nuts are the one of the</p>
<p>best nuts to have it and</p>
<p>and they have um you can buy them just</p>
<p>direct or just have them coated with</p>
<p>little chocolate and with with zero</p>
<p>sugar I really like those as a little</p>
<p>dessert and um I don&rsquo;t have a picture</p>
<p>but I put the link I&rsquo;ll put the link</p>
<p>down below you might want to check it</p>
<p>out it&rsquo;s a if you need a little dessert</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a fat dessert I think you might</p>
<p>like this so check it out the sad thing</p>
<p>Doc is that is that we&rsquo;re out of time</p>
<p>which you were about to announce the</p>
<p>good thing is the audience doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to listen to any more dings uh today and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try to remedy that by next</p>
<p>week and sorry for stepping on your dock</p>
<p>take us away</p>
<p>thank you so much uh stay tuned for some</p>
<p>really good videos this next week and I</p>
<p>appreciate all of your wonderful</p>
<p>questions and your comments</p>
