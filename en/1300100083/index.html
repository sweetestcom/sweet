<p>right away he says</p>
<p>man they&rsquo;re reusable i say</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s that was not</p>
<p>right the best was</p>
<p>that my other friend he forgot it</p>

<p>paper bag and there were some poor</p>
<p>magazines in</p>

<p>japan too because</p>
<p>there are a</p>
<p>bunch of freaks over there</p>

<p>wow yeah so</p>

<p>whole cup so your</p>
<p>penis can only go in</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s for small penises i</p>
<p>guess you have to make a hole at the</p>
<p>other side yeah well how&rsquo;s that work</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s not designed for american or</p>
<p>dutch cocks</p>
<p>right for those</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t know who we&rsquo;re talking to this is</p>
<p>a true mixed martial arts</p>
<p>legend a real pioneer</p>
<p>boss rooting</p>
<p>was a former</p>
<p>ufc heavyweight</p>
<p>champion and when i</p>
<p>first saw boss</p>
<p>fight i saw you</p>
<p>fight back before</p>
<p>there was any real good</p>
<p>striking in</p>
<p>mixed martial arts</p>
<p>mixed martial arts was</p>
<p>a lot of it was you know karate</p>
<p>guys that weren&rsquo;t that good you</p>
<p>know there was a few people that were just wild and</p>
<p>crazy that were getting in there and trying it</p>
<p>and there was pancreas was</p>
<p>going on over in japan</p>
<p>and a buddy of</p>
<p>mine had sent me a tape</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d said</p>
<p>i forget who</p>
<p>gave me the tape but he goes you</p>
<p>gotta watch this</p>
<p>motherfucker boss root and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s finally a guy</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s over there that knows how to</p>
<p>strike and you were</p>
<p>ballasting guys like in pancreas</p>
<p>it was a lot of like they had these</p>
<p>shin pads on for</p>
<p>folks who haven&rsquo;t seen it</p>
<p>and you weren&rsquo;t allowed to</p>
<p>punch to the face</p>
<p>but you could use open palms</p>
<p>so what boss figured out how to do</p>
<p>was pull his hand</p>
<p>way back so he was</p>
<p>punching with his palm</p>
<p>where everybody else was doing</p>
<p>bitch slaps</p>
<p>boss was blasting guys with straight</p>
<p>right palms and</p>
<p>knocking them</p>
<p>unconscious</p>
<p>and body kicks</p>
<p>they just couldn&rsquo;t believe how much pain they were in</p>
<p>you were one of the</p>
<p>first guys from holland</p>
<p>that you know that hard dutch</p>
<p>style of kickboxing to</p>
<p>enter into mixed martial arts</p>
<p>i worked i used that already palm</p>
<p>strikes when i was a</p>
<p>bouncer because i</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t like to mess up my face so and i always thought</p>
<p>you have a way longer reach</p>
<p>like for instance</p>
<p>the left hook</p>
<p>right straight you know that combination</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great but if you</p>
<p>if you connect with the left hook you&rsquo;re too</p>
<p>close for the straight punch</p>
<p>you see and the longer the</p>
<p>punches the more</p>
<p>power it has</p>
<p>so i said why don&rsquo;t i hit with a palm</p>
<p>you know because</p>
<p>then it becomes almost as long as my straight punch</p>
<p>so the straight will have more effect</p>
<p>you know and then people</p>
<p>started thinking i said if</p>
<p>you hit behind the ear if you can see when i&rsquo;m fighting</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m hitting</p>
<p>right here just behind the ear at the jaw</p>
<p>where the jaw starts</p>
<p>and if you tap</p>
<p>it there yeah you&rsquo;ll drop well you&rsquo;re one of</p>
<p>those guys too you analyze different ways to attack</p>
<p>opponents and that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ve got all these</p>
<p>videos online of</p>
<p>self defense techniques and bars</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t seen</p>
<p>these videos have you seen them the</p>
<p>music video ones one i</p>
<p>love fucking</p>
<p>fantastic no</p>
<p>sorry i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sorry bang bang bang</p>
<p>oh looky look what we got here how did that get</p>
<p>started how did you</p>
<p>start doing</p>
<p>those it was the funniest</p>
<p>thing i made the big</p>
<p>boss rudan&rsquo;s big books of combat</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>i promised that the</p>
<p>first 300 people</p>
<p>were going to get a</p>
<p>self defense</p>
<p>book a small one a</p>
<p>small book like</p>
<p>50 pages book or something</p>
<p>but then this guy</p>
<p>screwed me over with the books</p>
<p>and when that all happened you know</p>
<p>i left this guy but i came back to him i said listen</p>
<p>i told the people that the</p>
<p>first 300 were</p>
<p>gonna get it and i</p>
<p>wanna keep my word</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna do anything with this guy anymore because</p>
<p>you know it took too</p>
<p>much for me already so anyway we said why don&rsquo;t i make</p>
<p>a video we do an instructional dvd</p>
<p>and then we give that to the</p>
<p>first 300 people oh that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great and she</p>
<p>said what do you want</p>
<p>to say well get the camera</p>
<p>it was like totally non scripted</p>
<p>you know when we</p>
<p>started at the bar how</p>
<p>funny was that you know that i go around the bar and</p>
<p>i see a little</p>
<p>what do you call it a</p>
<p>saucer or something i said okay well this you can</p>
<p>throw at him to distract you can</p>
<p>break it now he&rsquo;s got sharp</p>
<p>edges you can slice him</p>
<p>you know and then</p>
<p>when i go through that</p>
<p>thing that holds the receipt you know that pin</p>
<p>i grab and i look at the</p>
<p>thing and i go</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t need to tell you what you can do with this</p>
<p>it was the funniest</p>
<p>we had to stop so many times that we were dying</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all one take no preparation</p>
<p>nothing well see you don&rsquo;t have to worry</p>
<p>about things you</p>
<p>think like that all the time yeah</p>
<p>and being a</p>
<p>bouncer that is one</p>
<p>one i&rsquo;ve never been a</p>
<p>bouncer but i</p>
<p>did well i actually did work as a</p>
<p>bouncer at a concert</p>
<p>place at great woods it was a concert center and</p>
<p>there was a lot of</p>
<p>fights as concert</p>
<p>constantly dealing with fight</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s different than a bar</p>
<p>because a bar</p>
<p>is more dangerous is more contained the concert</p>
<p>places big and wide open it was an outdoor venue</p>
<p>you know when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re at a bar you must have seen a lot of shit</p>
<p>especially in holland</p>
<p>holland&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>crazy place it is</p>
<p>it is a crazy</p>
<p>place you have to</p>
<p>watch out then</p>
<p>you know i wasn&rsquo;t in that era that they really</p>
<p>started to come with the weapons</p>
<p>i was always fortunate you know to</p>
<p>the big guys</p>
<p>would come in</p>
<p>and they would actually give</p>
<p>their guns to us</p>
<p>you know we put them to the side</p>
<p>and when something</p>
<p>come in with</p>
<p>their guns oh yeah and they</p>
<p>will be put restored them for them before they went in</p>
<p>holy shit yeah it was</p>
<p>crazy you know i</p>
<p>had one guy it was a it was high up</p>
<p>there was actually cool because</p>
<p>i worked there only for like two weeks it was a big</p>
<p>place the galaxy</p>
<p>and set token boss</p>
<p>and a very known</p>
<p>place it gets big they</p>
<p>had some epic</p>
<p>fights there man</p>
<p>really cool and</p>
<p>this guy works at anyway</p>
<p>something broke out and</p>
<p>right away the</p>
<p>big guy the the guy was on top of the ladder</p>
<p>he grabbed me from the front</p>
<p>and he bear hug me</p>
<p>and he says we&rsquo;re just gonna</p>
<p>stand like this</p>
<p>and i said whoa is this i just want to take the</p>
<p>the worst one the most dangerous one i just want to</p>
<p>hold you like this so that was kind of a</p>
<p>compliment because all the</p>
<p>other bouncers heard it</p>
<p>they go like who&rsquo;s this guy you know and then</p>
<p>the world starts to</p>
<p>travel you know how it goes</p>
<p>so holland the</p>
<p>fights that happen in holland in</p>
<p>bars it seems to happen a lot with</p>
<p>mma guys i know you&rsquo;ve been in a</p>

<p>they they said can you come with us</p>
<p>so we go to</p>
<p>these two doors through</p>
<p>these two doors and there&rsquo;s a big fire</p>
<p>stairs like a marble</p>
<p>stairs giant</p>
<p>and he says well we want you to</p>

<p>gonna do something of course so he pushes me</p>
<p>and i said why would you push me i said i</p>
<p>wanna go it&rsquo;s okay you know i don&rsquo;t want any trouble</p>
<p>and he stopped putting his finger on my chest</p>
<p>which is something i really can&rsquo;t stand</p>
<p>right so i said okay don&rsquo;t touch me because if</p>
<p>you know if you do that again it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna go wrong and sure enough they were looking for a</p>
<p>fight of course</p>
<p>he did it again so i pushed him</p>
<p>and another guy behind him jumped over him and he</p>
<p>stabbed the finger in my eye and said guys</p>
<p>come on let&rsquo;s stop this right now i don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>boop my other eye</p>
<p>and there i went boom</p>
<p>and that guy went down</p>
<p>he went down like one</p>
<p>punch i&rsquo;ve never seen anything i</p>
<p>heard him over the music</p>
<p>i heard that</p>
<p>yeah that was the wildest thing ever</p>
<p>and then they had these little</p>
<p>microphones right so</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t know but fast it was like</p>
<p>it was five guys four five guys</p>
<p>and they start fighting and the guy that i</p>
<p>knocked out constantly because he would wake up</p>
<p>right and everything went good and went good</p>
<p>but then i started realizing wait a minute</p>
<p>these guys are gonna come back up all the time you know</p>
<p>this is gonna come to an end they</p>
<p>gotta get the hell out of here</p>
<p>so you knocking them down</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re hitting them they&rsquo;re falling down everyone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming at you you&rsquo;re not now but you realize and</p>
<p>you got to get out of here i had to get out of there</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s one part</p>
<p>until this day i have no clue what this was i&rsquo;m falling</p>
<p>against the wall</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a hole in the wall you know with a little</p>
<p>like bar in</p>
<p>front of it and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>broomsticks</p>
<p>broomsticks</p>
<p>but no brooms on</p>
<p>broomsticks just</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m grabbing one but</p>
<p>right away when i grab one i</p>
<p>think to myself i said</p>
<p>if i grab one they</p>
<p>gonna grab one</p>
<p>so i leave it</p>
<p>and it could</p>
<p>but they passed it</p>
<p>and they all took a</p>
<p>freaking broomstick</p>
<p>and i go oh you know</p>
<p>we were fighting</p>
<p>five guys with</p>
<p>broomsticks it was wild and then</p>
<p>i had to get</p>
<p>get the hell out of there so i went all the way down</p>
<p>and i remember</p>
<p>till this day it was a door that you know one of</p>
<p>these copper</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>you have to push in and then you open up so i</p>
<p>click and it&rsquo;s closed</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m go okay</p>
<p>and now what</p>
<p>you know so i turned around and i thought okay now i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go only for the eyes</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna hit him in the throat</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna kick him in the balls that&rsquo;s the only</p>
<p>thing i&rsquo;m gonna go for now and they looked at me</p>
<p>and they all step back</p>
<p>so i go whoa</p>
<p>they can see i mean business right</p>
<p>but behind me is the</p>
<p>whole police force</p>
<p>outside because there were windows</p>
<p>so they they</p>
<p>throw me in jail</p>
<p>and because</p>
<p>apparently one of</p>
<p>those monsters was a cop</p>
<p>and yeah and i</p>
<p>knocked him out of course also but he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>never told me that he was a god</p>
<p>but otherwise i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have done that</p>
<p>anyway we&rsquo;re there and this is also this is actually a</p>
<p>funny story</p>
<p>because before this all happened i&rsquo;m talking to my wife</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m already tanked right</p>
<p>she says why are you</p>
<p>laughing why you have so much fun i said</p>

<p>honey don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry about you know me if i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>drunk you know i don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>about anything</p>
<p>especially not that</p>
<p>i just want to have fun so</p>
<p>after two days they allowed me to get my</p>
<p>first phone call</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m calling my wife and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>freaking out i said</p>

<p>i didn&rsquo;t fuck two swedish girls</p>
<p>she says the bad news is i mean jill</p>
<p>she gonna hate me before the story because every time</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s not funny i think that&rsquo;s a hell of a story</p>
<p>you got the movie</p>
<p>yeah true story that&rsquo;s an outstanding story</p>
<p>so how did you get out of the country what happened</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>i asked them if they press charges and they said no</p>
<p>so i said okay i&rsquo;m not gonna press charges either</p>
<p>but apparently they did press charges</p>
<p>and then i had to go to court so i get this lawyer</p>
<p>and also you know they</p>
<p>drive me from the normal police station to jail right</p>
<p>this is like a move joe you drive into a mountain</p>
<p>and the road stops in the middle of a mountain</p>
<p>you get out this elevator</p>
<p>like two elevators i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about good when elevator i go like four stories up</p>
<p>i go out take another elevator go like two down</p>

<p>so i had a vcr</p>
<p>i had coffee cookies</p>
<p>i was playing guards with the</p>
<p>guards they actually gave me my phone they said oh</p>

<p>yeah it was nice</p>
<p>so then the lawyer comes the lawyer goes i say okay so</p>
<p>when can i go you know and he said well</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably gonna get like six to nine months</p>
<p>i said whoa</p>

<p>started they talked</p>
<p>apparently they talked to those guys</p>
<p>and i said man come on</p>
<p>take your charges back and that&rsquo;s what they did</p>
<p>and then they never go wow</p>
<p>you imagine six months</p>

<p>somewhere really weird</p>
<p>remember that the chair was in a mountain that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy it was in a</p>
<p>freaking mountain that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy and then</p>
<p>when you had to</p>
<p>let you know to go</p>

<p>it was like a circle</p>
<p>and it was divided like a pie</p>
<p>like an eight</p>
<p>and but with a fence like you</p>

<p>sweden is a strange</p>
<p>place and they take like violence and</p>

<p>world really yeah</p>
<p>japan is too but sweden is one</p>

<p>will turn the</p>
<p>plane right around and you know</p>
<p>wow so this is nice you say 96 97 yeah</p>
<p>about that time</p>
<p>i remember when you</p>
<p>could get on a</p>
<p>plane with just you didn&rsquo;t even have you have</p>
<p>to have a driver&rsquo;s license</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all you had to have</p>
<p>you know what you didn&rsquo;t even have to have a driver&rsquo;s</p>
<p>license i remember when you didn&rsquo;t get on a</p>
<p>plane with nothing</p>
<p>you just go on</p>
<p>with a ticket</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i meant</p>
<p>when i used to compete when i was doing taekwondo</p>
<p>tournaments we</p>
<p>would fly oh</p>
<p>i had a ticket</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t have a driver&rsquo;s</p>
<p>license they</p>
<p>told me to canada for a long time you</p>
<p>could go with your driver&rsquo;s</p>
<p>license too</p>
<p>right to canada yeah to</p>
<p>canada and to mexico</p>
<p>but then the united</p>
<p>states started being douchebags</p>
<p>about it and</p>
<p>you know they</p>
<p>would cut back on</p>
<p>mexicans and canadians coming</p>
<p>over here and so they made it more difficult and so</p>
<p>canada and mexico</p>
<p>made it more difficult too but yeah when i</p>
<p>first used to go to montreal</p>
<p>when i used</p>
<p>to do the comedy festival up there i didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a passport you got</p>
<p>trouble at the border there all the time</p>
<p>in canada never for some reason they always</p>
<p>get me out i have no clue why that is me too i have</p>
<p>no clue well it&rsquo;s your record</p>
<p>they find your record i mean</p>
<p>if you have an</p>
<p>assault like what happened in</p>
<p>sweden but what happened in sweden</p>
<p>no that was not because they went to</p>
<p>court and they</p>
<p>threw it out it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>the fact that you got arrested and you went to</p>
<p>court and all that and you were in a jail</p>
<p>for a little bit even if there&rsquo;s no charges that stick</p>
<p>they still have that on your record like</p>
<p>eddie bravo got arrested once</p>
<p>for legally having a gun</p>
<p>he got pulled over</p>
<p>for a traffic violation this one he was working for a</p>
<p>check cashing company needs to</p>
<p>carry around</p>
<p>a big bag of cash with them and he had to</p>
<p>carry a gun with them</p>
<p>and it was totally</p>
<p>legal but he had done something</p>
<p>like not stopping at a stop sign or something like that</p>
<p>so they pull</p>
<p>him over he said i just want to let you know</p>
<p>i have a gun a loaded gun in the car because i do this</p>
<p>they arrested him</p>
<p>they released him</p>
<p>because you know it was all correct they check his</p>
<p>paperwork it&rsquo;s all good</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>every time he goes to canada</p>
<p>every single time he gets pregnant</p>
<p>pulled aside</p>
<p>and they check his shit</p>
<p>and they ask him questions and it takes like an</p>
<p>extra hour and a half i got</p>
<p>stuck with him the last time i went to it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>annoying it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>annoying yeah and he</p>
<p>had no record i mean he did nothing</p>
<p>you know and never</p>
<p>stuck as a record but just the fact that he was even</p>
<p>arrested yeah</p>
<p>yeah just big</p>
<p>roided guy one time</p>
<p>standing there all</p>
<p>messed up when you go to get any</p>
<p>rights in the back</p>
<p>swear to god</p>
<p>i look at him</p>
<p>and say rights is perfected</p>
<p>perfected man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you said</p>
<p>straight in the eye it&rsquo;s funny</p>

<p>his bodies your body&rsquo;s not supposed to look</p>
<p>like that it&rsquo;s not supposed to that is not a fighters</p>
<p>build you know when you see these guys</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s guys in the</p>

<p>first 30 or 40</p>
<p>seconds you know that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>you could really gorilla fuck a guy for 30 or 40</p>
<p>seconds but then that lactic acid builds up</p>
<p>and boom crashing</p>
<p>yeah i always said i i</p>
<p>i never cared</p>
<p>about it and</p>
<p>never care if somebody said oh he&rsquo;s on</p>

<p>to me it is</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re insecure already</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>wrong with you because you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>happy with yourself let&rsquo;s go to that</p>
<p>and that bullshit</p>
<p>thing that they</p>
<p>say you know it yeah but everybody does it</p>

<p>to speak to the guys</p>
<p>you know to</p>
<p>help them out in the future once they do a pro what to</p>
<p>watch out for</p>
<p>and then the last the most important</p>
<p>thing what is the most important</p>
<p>thing they said i said well don&rsquo;t do rights</p>
<p>i mean if you if you already did words or are thinking</p>
<p>about doing words i mean you</p>

<p>particular stage</p>
<p>right now if you&rsquo;re already thinking</p>
<p>about it you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna fail you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be a loser</p>
<p>because you</p>
<p>you want rights</p>
<p>i never got that</p>
<p>and how danger is it you know what i hear the epo</p>
<p>you know people doing that i go mad it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t that make your</p>
<p>blood really thick hmm</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very dangerous and very common by the way yeah um</p>
<p>guy boxers been caught with it</p>
<p>sugar shame mosley got caught with it</p>
<p>you know epo</p>
<p>is what they always accuse</p>
<p>cyclists of</p>
<p>using and i had</p>
<p>a friend who was a professional</p>
<p>cyclist and he was on it</p>
<p>and he said</p>
<p>that when he was on a tour they were on a tour</p>
<p>they would ride on a bus</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>would compete in</p>
<p>these tournaments</p>
<p>and these are races rather and</p>
<p>you would hear guys in the middle of the</p>
<p>night unrack</p>
<p>their bikes and go ride they had to</p>
<p>if the heart rate</p>
<p>goes down or something well it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>too much blood</p>
<p>too much blood</p>
<p>builds up in your body because what what epo</p>
<p>simulates is it&rsquo;s like artificial altitude</p>
<p>you know like the same</p>
<p>effect that happens at altitude where your</p>
<p>blood thickens because you</p>
<p>need more oxygen because it&rsquo;s a low oxygen environment</p>
<p>so these guys and they take this epo</p>
<p>they have to exercise</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;ll wake up at like</p>
<p>three o&rsquo;clock in the morning and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>their parts all fucked up and they</p>
<p>gotta get on the bike and go yeah i was</p>
<p>gonna have a</p>
<p>heart attack or something</p>
<p>yeah you could have strokes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very dangerous i know</p>
<p>mixed martial arts guys that have</p>
<p>and i know guys that have done it that you know</p>
<p>their trainer</p>
<p>found out like</p>
<p>after the fight and</p>
<p>they were like what the fuck man you</p>
<p>gotta let us know that you&rsquo;re doing this</p>
<p>so that if you get</p>
<p>knocked out</p>
<p>we can tell the doctor hey here&rsquo;s something you</p>
<p>should consider you</p>
<p>guys on fucking epo</p>
<p>you know use a pen as a</p>
<p>syringe you know</p>
<p>you need to evolve like this because it&rsquo;s so thick yes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s coming out like lava</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get up</p>
<p>i was talking to a joe mccarthy</p>
<p>and i said you know what the new oh no no he asked me</p>
<p>since you know what the newest</p>
<p>drug is like</p>
<p>for fighting i said tell</p>
<p>i said viagra</p>

<p>i say i read an article</p>
<p>about it like a week before that</p>
<p>and apparently</p>
<p>guys are doing that taking viagra and</p>
<p>apparently viagra is one of this wonder</p>
<p>things it&rsquo;s really good for your kidneys for</p>
<p>blood pressure for i mean</p>
<p>i read an article in</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s why i tell you some</p>
<p>fitness magazine and it was like raving</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s a real good</p>
<p>medicine apparently but can you imagine</p>
<p>well what it does is it increases your nitric</p>
<p>oxide and all</p>
<p>those chemicals</p>
<p>those supplements</p>
<p>that people take you know nitric burn all</p>
<p>these different nitric</p>
<p>flood all these different things</p>
<p>this is the</p>
<p>exact same thing increases your nitric</p>
<p>oxide that&rsquo;s why your dick it&rsquo;s hard so</p>
<p>quick your muscles</p>
<p>fucking flare</p>
<p>veins get back big yeah</p>
<p>mmm definitely yeah</p>
<p>until it goes to the ground then it&rsquo;ll be uncomfortable</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m saying you know what do you do</p>
<p>as long as you keep your cup in</p>
<p>place a little tickle tickle</p>
<p>depends on if you have a dick that</p>
<p>could fit into one of</p>
<p>those japanese</p>
<p>masturbations</p>
<p>people might not even ever know right yeah</p>
<p>yeah that was funny</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re one of the guys</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re one of the few guys that has gone through a</p>
<p>mixed martial arts career and has</p>
<p>successfully brought</p>
<p>transition to a broadcasting career</p>
<p>i mean you you made</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>smart in how you handled it because</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t take too many</p>
<p>fights you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>go with your ego and have</p>
<p>fights after</p>
<p>you were busy with other</p>
<p>things or weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fully concentrated on it</p>
<p>you stepped away in full health</p>
<p>how did you manage to do that</p>
<p>not full health</p>
<p>not full health my knees were very bothering me and</p>
<p>one of the worst</p>
<p>things i have is</p>
<p>tendonitis in both my arms</p>
<p>and if that hits if that starts</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know did you yeah</p>
<p>did you ever</p>
<p>you have ever had yes</p>
<p>yeah okay now i have both here in the arms upstairs</p>
<p>and if it hits it&rsquo;s about a</p>
<p>45 minute hour</p>
<p>a pain which is unimaginable it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like yeah you have no clue</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like coming from the outside it&rsquo;s like he it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t describe it there&rsquo;s no pain like it and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing you can do you can take pain pills for</p>
<p>nothing wow and if the writer i</p>
<p>would lose weight</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>when i made that comeback in two thousand six</p>
<p>six weeks before</p>
<p>it hit it you know i had</p>
<p>nine weeks to prepare</p>
<p>i think two times</p>
<p>three times five days i took off</p>
<p>that i literally only worked my legs and</p>
<p>because i had the</p>
<p>tendonitis and then</p>
<p>because you lose weight from the pain</p>
<p>and then i start realizing</p>
<p>okay this is the reason that i stopped because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not fun anymore you know you&rsquo;re on the ground</p>
<p>everything hurts i was rolling</p>
<p>in eddie&rsquo;s class</p>
<p>and with goliath</p>
<p>you remember the big guy there</p>
<p>and i was gonna</p>
<p>fight leo polo</p>
<p>and kim o the</p>
<p>apollo and he</p>
<p>very much looks like him like built</p>
<p>i might get</p>
<p>a roll with you because i need to just get up and just</p>
<p>strike get up and strike</p>
<p>and i had to</p>
<p>tendonitis and i man</p>
<p>everything was hurting and i</p>
<p>could see everybody look like oh is this bastard</p>
<p>so i go okay man please give me a number you know</p>
<p>so i got his number of five days</p>
<p>later i said</p>
<p>and i took five days</p>
<p>offset come back</p>
<p>again and he was like whoa what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on now because it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whole different ball game</p>
<p>but so that means that every</p>
<p>every time when you</p>
<p>train with that it man it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so much pain</p>
<p>that yeah you lose weight you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>eat you know yeah tears in your eyes from the pain as</p>
<p>well and so what exactly is</p>
<p>tendonitis what is it what is it from</p>
<p>i have no clue</p>
<p>and you know what i realized that beginning in</p>
<p>early days when i did</p>
<p>track and field</p>
<p>i already had it there i</p>
<p>think that it comes from</p>
<p>all the cortisones that i took i was a very sick kid</p>
<p>badass my bad eczema</p>
<p>everywhere and</p>
<p>they gave me a lot of cortisones you know they always</p>
<p>were afraid something was</p>
<p>gonna happen in the end</p>
<p>and that and that has an</p>
<p>effect i hear on your</p>
<p>skeleton you know it melts they say</p>
<p>but i guess if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>could have got</p>
<p>you attendance</p>
<p>right wow that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy so you were you were a sick kid and you</p>
<p>transitioned</p>
<p>somehow into a martial arts</p>
<p>champion wow</p>
<p>right did you</p>
<p>start training really</p>
<p>hard because of your sickness because your asthma</p>
<p>is that one</p>
<p>yeah i i got</p>
<p>bullied a lot i i was a very lonely kid i</p>
<p>i was i was into trees</p>
<p>i had a really cool</p>
<p>skill i could</p>
<p>climb in a tree in the forest and i</p>
<p>could like 45</p>
<p>of the forest i go from treetop to treetop i</p>
<p>would start</p>
<p>swinging yeah</p>
<p>what go to the next</p>
<p>one yeah so if they</p>
<p>would follow me if they</p>
<p>would come out</p>
<p>to me fucking tarzan yeah</p>
<p>holy shit and i</p>
<p>climbed in a tree so they would go</p>
<p>after you and you</p>
<p>would jump from tree to tree like a monkey</p>
<p>get away from them</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i did</p>
<p>and a few of them fell</p>
<p>you know one was almost</p>
<p>they almost didn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>it you know i mean his hat fell like next to a rock</p>
<p>that scared everybody so much that that was my</p>
<p>harbor that was my safe harbor</p>
<p>you know every time</p>
<p>something happens i just</p>
<p>climbed a tree</p>
<p>it was it but i</p>
<p>think that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where i got my athleticism from</p>
<p>just climbing</p>
<p>climbing all the time yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>crazy it&rsquo;s amazing how many</p>
<p>mixed martial artists were bullied</p>
<p>you know i mean people look at a guy like you and they</p>
<p>would go there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no fucking way this guy was ever bullied</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing how much of that happens and what the</p>
<p>fuck i mean how do you stop that shit from happening in</p>
<p>school i know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re involved in a lot of anti</p>
<p>bullying programs and i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen you do you know public service announcements and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>how the how do you stop that in school</p>
<p>you get you</p>
<p>you know and it&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard you have to make sure that the</p>
<p>that the whole</p>
<p>school knows like i</p>
<p>would do how do you say that and um</p>
<p>i would tell there</p>
<p>if i if i would</p>
<p>speak in front of</p>
<p>those people that the bullies</p>
<p>that there we</p>
<p>gotta have sympathy for those guys</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s obviously something&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with them</p>
<p>they only can team up</p>
<p>you know to get somebody and they pick the weakest guy</p>
<p>i mean seriously if you guys</p>
<p>think this is cool</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the biggest</p>
<p>loser of the</p>
<p>whole school and i</p>
<p>think that weird</p>
<p>human nature</p>
<p>thing it really is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like we probably get beat at home</p>
<p>you know and if you</p>
<p>start talking like that</p>
<p>hopefully it rings a bell with a</p>
<p>bully because</p>
<p>otherwise she can&rsquo;t stop this</p>
<p>you know are you here</p>
<p>every now and then</p>
<p>about guys who are</p>
<p>fighters who are bullies</p>
<p>you know who you hear</p>
<p>about bullying in the gym</p>
<p>guys who are really good fucking</p>
<p>other guys up like</p>
<p>young guys that a lot</p>
<p>about hector lombard you know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s true but you hear a lot of stories</p>
<p>about him beating the shit out of</p>
<p>young guys and hurting people</p>
<p>yeah you know and you know that that has to</p>
<p>be something from their</p>
<p>childhood it just has to something happened there</p>
<p>yeah yeah scary</p>
<p>stuff you would</p>
<p>think that a guy who&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>trained fighter though you</p>
<p>would think well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like that would be my solution like how do you get</p>
<p>bullying out of the</p>
<p>schools i really</p>
<p>think you should</p>
<p>teach kids how to fight</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think they</p>
<p>should have to</p>
<p>fight but i</p>
<p>think you know offer it</p>
<p>in physical education offer it because</p>
<p>for a man it&rsquo;s one of the most important</p>
<p>things you could ever</p>
<p>learn for developing your character</p>
<p>for being just</p>
<p>being more confident and getting out</p>
<p>aggression so you can</p>
<p>think things more clearly</p>
<p>i we at ktla</p>
<p>this morning in the gym</p>
<p>and it was i was</p>
<p>frank your gym</p>
<p>by the way for people don&rsquo;t know you have a</p>
<p>great gym and thousand oaks and</p>
<p>how do people get there what is</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the what&rsquo;s the name of it it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>boss rutan&rsquo;s elite mma</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s from 8080</p>
<p>hampshire wrote</p>
<p>in thousands of</p>
<p>this is a rare</p>
<p>opportunity</p>
<p>if you live in this area to train with</p>
<p>you know a true</p>
<p>legend in a</p>
<p>pioneer and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>every day there</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m trey i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>teaching every day so it&rsquo;s not like my</p>
<p>name is on the gym and i&rsquo;m not there i don&rsquo;t like this</p>
<p>you know and so ktla was at your gym ktla was a jim</p>
<p>frank shamrock</p>
<p>was at the gym my friend</p>
<p>holt mckellan</p>
<p>you the guy from</p>
<p>lights out to the new tv show on fx</p>
<p>great show and</p>
<p>boxing shows yeah yeah he&rsquo;s next</p>
<p>heavyweight</p>
<p>champion you know and now he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got to cope with</p>
<p>all the problems you know the</p>
<p>money is gone and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got a little bit sopranos meats</p>
<p>rocky meat you know like serious like that</p>
<p>and and yeah all of us were</p>
<p>bullied also</p>
<p>frank also was a little fat kid he said</p>
<p>and then he also because he went to</p>
<p>boarding school</p>
<p>in in scotland his father sent him over</p>
<p>there he was the only american there so that went wrong</p>
<p>and with me also it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>yeah because of the</p>
<p>eczema and all of my</p>
<p>asthma you know</p>
<p>the alma and eczema</p>
<p>yeah they went</p>
<p>ahead and had together</p>
<p>how&rsquo;d they fix that i grew over it you know what the</p>
<p>weirdest thing is</p>
<p>when i stepped into the</p>
<p>states when i was</p>
<p>fighting in pancras if you see some</p>
<p>fights you&rsquo;ll see i</p>
<p>still have everywhere have spots</p>
<p>you know and when i came into america</p>
<p>i think within a month</p>
<p>everything i mean i see</p>
<p>almost disappearing</p>
<p>like was gone</p>
<p>i think also the climate</p>
<p>maybe has something to do with</p>
<p>california climate</p>
<p>yeah i love it</p>
<p>this is actually it&rsquo;s not too hard not to dry you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s perfect</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a pretty good</p>
<p>place to live</p>
<p>yeah we just said it right</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s pretty awesome</p>
<p>when you hear</p>
<p>about people in minnesota</p>
<p>freezing their dicks off</p>
<p>like i said i came into the</p>
<p>stage i said why</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t everybody in america live here</p>
<p>why would you live here seems like they do though</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no houses</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people living here man</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>so um so you didn&rsquo;t exactly</p>
<p>transition out without</p>
<p>any pain that said that was one of the reasons why you</p>
<p>you cut your your</p>
<p>fighting career short</p>
<p>attended honest yep</p>
<p>yep that at</p>
<p>my knees i have no cartilage on my kneecaps really</p>
<p>which sounds</p>
<p>as a very easy</p>
<p>thing to fix but</p>
<p>in reality it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>worst problem</p>
<p>any can have</p>
<p>i mean cartilage</p>
<p>in between the knees when a</p>
<p>bunch they can do something</p>
<p>about that you know but cartage on the kneecap</p>
<p>they can my friend has</p>
<p>his knees resurfaced he had them resurfaced with steel</p>
<p>they put some sort of a</p>
<p>steel or titanium</p>
<p>plate over the knee</p>
<p>my friend steve was on the us ski team back</p>
<p>in the 80s and he fucked his knees up really really bad</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s had i believe 16 or 17</p>
<p>surgeries on his knees</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re mangled</p>
<p>and they just recently put artificial</p>
<p>meniscus in place</p>
<p>this white padded</p>
<p>stuff in between the knees</p>
<p>his cartilage is so chewed up</p>
<p>that they actually resurfaced</p>
<p>it with metal</p>
<p>so he has like it like it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>crazy looking</p>
<p>thing man it&rsquo;s like metal</p>
<p>like on top of kneecap i have it here somewhere in my</p>
<p>email i&rsquo;ll find it for you before we</p>
<p>leave tonight so you can</p>
<p>check it out</p>
<p>but so there</p>
<p>is a solution that my friends do you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard they can for instance</p>
<p>they can put the kneecap is in constant</p>
<p>motion you know</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not like you can put something on there</p>
<p>and then because it gets</p>
<p>ripped off right away</p>
<p>again but it can do is like</p>
<p>drill a hole in there and then</p>
<p>i put a teflon</p>
<p>plate in it</p>
<p>but then if you</p>
<p>drill the hole the knee becomes</p>
<p>thirty five percent more weak so you have</p>
<p>way more chance to</p>
<p>break the knee and once you</p>
<p>break your kneecap</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>it was my doctor said that&rsquo;s why they the buffy osis</p>
<p>they break your kneecaps</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>worst thing to do to somebody</p>
<p>yeah the knees are brutal man</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve had three knee operations i had</p>
<p>my left acl reconstructed my meniscus</p>
<p>scope to my left knee</p>
<p>here i got a</p>
<p>picture of it here if you</p>
<p>wanna check it out</p>
<p>check this out real quick</p>
<p>you see that</p>
<p>this is a resurfacing this is</p>
<p>where they took</p>
<p>his cartilage was so fucked up</p>
<p>took it off and they resurfaced it with</p>
<p>steel and this</p>
<p>white stuff in this picture</p>
<p>this is the artificial</p>
<p>meniscus i&rsquo;ll put this</p>
<p>picture on twitter</p>
<p>later on so what else</p>
<p>pretty fucking</p>
<p>man the stuff that they can do nowadays is bizarre</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s pretty fucking</p>
<p>crazy yeah i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i mean this is really new</p>
<p>stuff that they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>but i mean his knee looks like</p>
<p>it looks like but how does he feel</p>
<p>it feels great</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s fucked me</p>
<p>crazy touches</p>
<p>the wildest</p>
<p>motherfucker i&rsquo;ve ever met he was</p>
<p>a flight surgeon he&rsquo;s in his 50s and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still trying to</p>
<p>fight it&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s out of his mind you it&rsquo;s a very hard</p>
<p>thing to step</p>
<p>away from you know to come back to it it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>when i have students of mine or friends of my</p>
<p>fighting it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m way more nervous than they are it&rsquo;s like because</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t control it&rsquo;s like sitting next to the driver</p>
<p>you know and they go fast you go like i rather have the</p>
<p>wheels so i</p>
<p>can control here</p>
<p>you know and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no feeling like it</p>
<p>like when you win or when you</p>
<p>for six or eight weeks you work on</p>
<p>like five special</p>
<p>dominations</p>
<p>you know on the ground and</p>
<p>standing and then to see if you can land one of</p>
<p>those and then 90</p>
<p>of the time you do</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that you really worked on and then you land that</p>
<p>thing and then</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a hole in one i</p>
<p>guess that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what i always say has to be feeling like that</p>
<p>yeah well i</p>
<p>think much crazier than that i</p>
<p>think that it&rsquo;s just the</p>
<p>ultimate gamble you know you&rsquo;re out there</p>
<p>throwing your bones at some guy</p>
<p>you know trying to</p>
<p>trying to hit his</p>
<p>vital areas</p>
<p>and it ain&rsquo;t just a regular guy it&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>expert and he&rsquo;s doing the</p>
<p>exact same thing and</p>
<p>so much of your success is</p>
<p>based on how much</p>
<p>dedication you have how much time you put in</p>
<p>how much you can keep your shit together</p>
<p>under pressure</p>
<p>is the ultimate high</p>
<p>right when you win is the</p>
<p>ultimate high</p>
<p>it really is and what you say</p>
<p>the thing is</p>
<p>can you i always say</p>
<p>can you bring</p>
<p>the dojo the way you fight and</p>
<p>train there</p>
<p>and spar there can you</p>
<p>bring that game</p>
<p>to the ring</p>
<p>cause that can</p>
<p>be a problem with that that&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>that is a big thing</p>
<p>under pressure you know guys</p>
<p>we have fires</p>
<p>right oh yeah</p>
<p>yeah and a lot</p>
<p>of guys fold like you&rsquo;ll see them they&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>great and they&rsquo;ll be like dominating</p>
<p>and then the guy will</p>
<p>still be there</p>
<p>yeah and then you see the adversity you see</p>
<p>doubt you see all kinds of creepy</p>
<p>things about</p>
<p>you know whatever the fuck</p>
<p>haunts their subconscious whatever the fuck is in</p>
<p>their personality that they don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>you see its surface</p>
<p>most of the time is that</p>
<p>you see a guy when he</p>
<p>hit him with a hard shot</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s most of the time the muscular guys by the way</p>
<p>check it out</p>
<p>and the big</p>
<p>blown up dudes</p>
<p>when they hit somebody with</p>
<p>their best bang</p>
<p>and the guy recovers and comes back then you see him go</p>
<p>and down or they have him in the</p>
<p>submission and they</p>
<p>think they had him and</p>
<p>and then the guy escapes</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s like a mental</p>
<p>break for them then they give up it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>weirdest thing you go like whoa</p>
<p>man it&rsquo;s so good i know so many fighters</p>
<p>who are like that</p>
<p>and i just do it</p>
<p>again do it</p>
<p>again and make it</p>
<p>a little bit more tight why won&rsquo;t you do that you know</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t they give up the fear of losing is a</p>
<p>tremendous burden that a lot of</p>
<p>guys have and it eventually manifests itself in a fight</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>afraid of losing they&rsquo;re so afraid of fucking up that</p>
<p>just it just</p>
<p>they make it happen but it&rsquo;s afraid of losing in</p>
<p>front of an audience</p>
<p>because they have to listen to</p>
<p>those people</p>
<p>gonna tell them what you</p>
<p>should have done this and</p>
<p>chris lieben said it really</p>
<p>funny a long time ago he says you got</p>
<p>knocked out by silver</p>
<p>and and then he said</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s bad if you go to the</p>
<p>blockbuster</p>
<p>and the guy behind the desk tells you what you</p>
<p>should have done</p>
<p>you know because everybody knows better</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s horrible</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why i always say i say you</p>
<p>fight for yourself and</p>
<p>you say oh buster you</p>
<p>fight for your family your wife and your kids no i</p>
<p>fight for me</p>
<p>because that takes a lot of pressure off because really</p>
<p>think about this and and</p>
<p>if if you have a fellow fighter</p>
<p>and you go both into a room you lock the door you guys</p>
<p>fight do you really care if you lose</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think i really care</p>
<p>i love to win</p>
<p>but you know i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s the best man that day he won the fight</p>
<p>now if it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>front of an audience you</p>
<p>gotta go through all that bs that</p>
<p>these other people say who have no clue</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s all about</p>
<p>but you see what i mean it&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fighting for</p>
<p>those people and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so much pressure that&rsquo;s why i stay away from the</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna rip his head off i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do this i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do that because all that</p>
<p>they will play at the moment you walk through the cage</p>
<p>and you hear yourself saying</p>
<p>what you gonna do head</p>
<p>right oh yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i</p>
<p>never did that because you put a lot of pressure on you</p>
<p>now i better do what i said</p>
<p>guys i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think guys realize it but you see it in</p>
<p>their face sometimes when they step into</p>
<p>the octagon you see all the shit talking they&rsquo;ve said</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>here we go like wow what have i fucking done</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a few shit talkers</p>
<p>who are actually really good</p>
<p>you know chelsea</p>
<p>was pretty good</p>
<p>that was yeah but</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the master josh barnett&rsquo;s pretty good at it too</p>
<p>george benetta&rsquo;s really good at it too yeah</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s a few guys if you guys have noticed slang</p>
<p>smart guy so</p>
<p>frank shamrock</p>
<p>was good at his</p>
<p>smart comments make and</p>
<p>tito made a</p>
<p>whole career out of it also you know</p>
<p>you know and everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i said that</p>
<p>those are not</p>
<p>the guys that you see you know they&rsquo;re playing a</p>
<p>smart game nick diaz</p>
<p>yeah yeah he loves it he loves it</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a he&rsquo;s a really nice guy you know i like him</p>
<p>well he gets</p>
<p>fired up though when he</p>
<p>fights when he</p>
<p>fights he&rsquo;s not such a nice guy</p>
<p>yeah yeah so that&rsquo;s the way</p>
<p>psychological</p>
<p>warfare is a part of</p>
<p>fighting right that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>who can i always say who&rsquo;s got the biggest balls</p>
<p>who can you know keep go keep on</p>
<p>going that&rsquo;s why i always say</p>
<p>stamina is the one number one thing</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing they can</p>
<p>never say for me my all</p>
<p>my career and</p>
<p>never run out of gas</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the only</p>
<p>thing you can</p>
<p>control you know when you train</p>
<p>go run an extra hill</p>
<p>through something i&rsquo;ve nothing for commer than losing</p>
<p>how difficult was that for you though when you</p>
<p>started to get the</p>
<p>tendonitis because you know there&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stamina from</p>
<p>you know from grappling</p>
<p>that you probably</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t get like i know for a fact that toshikosaka</p>
<p>fight yep when you fought kosaka</p>
<p>when you won the</p>
<p>title right that&rsquo;s you won the</p>
<p>title no that was your</p>
<p>first fight you know the</p>
<p>title from manaman</p>
<p>when you fought kosaka you</p>
<p>had a problem like you couldn&rsquo;t do any grappling for a</p>
<p>while right</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t you have a neck problem a neck problem i got</p>
<p>against daryl golar</p>
<p>the wrestler</p>
<p>very good i</p>
<p>got him in a triangle</p>
<p>at the gym and he lifted me up</p>
<p>and he slammed me down with my neck into the corner</p>
<p>that took a long time</p>
<p>god knows the whole</p>
<p>thing i just had surgery comes from that</p>
<p>all the way</p>
<p>back and that was the injury what it what was</p>
<p>it was i have no clue but it was so painful i had a</p>
<p>daughter at the time she was like</p>
<p>nine months old</p>
<p>and she could not lay on my chest</p>
<p>whoa i was coughing you know</p>
<p>and everything would</p>
<p>i would it was</p>
<p>funny because i had this big</p>
<p>syringe of lidocaine</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m injecting myself in between my rips</p>
<p>oh my god the</p>
<p>ufc comes in with the cameras</p>
<p>right and i was at the time with the</p>
<p>movie with universal soldier</p>
<p>and these guys are</p>
<p>freaking out you know i said no no no come in come</p>
<p>in i said this is you know the doctor no sense</p>
<p>vital king is dangerous shit yeah but</p>
<p>you have to watch out where to do it but</p>
<p>if they do it it always goes</p>
<p>wrong because they can&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>where it is</p>
<p>but i have to between every rip</p>
<p>so you have to do it yourself yeah</p>
<p>it was painful</p>
<p>lidocane is like the gay cousin of cocaine</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t know it just numbs</p>
<p>things up when i got my nose</p>
<p>fixed i got a deviated septum fix and they</p>
<p>squirt lidocaine out there when they&rsquo;re cleaning it out</p>
<p>so that it doesn&rsquo;t freak you out</p>
<p>is they go up in your nose with a vacuum</p>
<p>cleaner yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you know when you vacuum your car</p>
<p>at the car wash and</p>
<p>it gets stuck on the</p>
<p>floor mat and goes</p>
<p>that happens to the back of your fucking skull</p>
<p>right where your</p>
<p>brain is when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>cleaning out</p>
<p>blood clots</p>
<p>and dried up boogers and shit and they</p>
<p>spray lidocaine</p>
<p>up there and i felt</p>
<p>fucked up for the whole day</p>
<p>like i was like what is</p>
<p>wrong with me i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like out of it and then i realized oh that lidocaine</p>
<p>so then i go online and i&rsquo;m like what is the</p>
<p>effects of lidocaine</p>
<p>people fucking die from it</p>
<p>the girls that</p>
<p>put it on their legs</p>
<p>when they go to get</p>
<p>their legs lasered</p>
<p>they get the hair</p>
<p>lasered off</p>
<p>their legs it&rsquo;s painful</p>
<p>so they cover</p>
<p>their legs with lidocaine</p>
<p>some girl died in her fucking car</p>
<p>she covered her legs in lidocaine and then</p>
<p>wrapped her legs up and she</p>
<p>just ran around</p>
<p>and she just</p>
<p>od&rsquo;ed on oh</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re shooting it into your ribs and my ribs</p>
<p>i used them</p>
<p>many times that i</p>
<p>would go to the fight</p>
<p>and then one day</p>
<p>i had my resting</p>
<p>shoes because we had to wear</p>
<p>shoes at pancreas</p>
<p>they would be open like i had an</p>
<p>ankle injury</p>
<p>and i would wait</p>
<p>until they called my name</p>
<p>because one time i</p>
<p>broke my hand</p>
<p>the knuckle</p>
<p>and they said oh we put the</p>
<p>lighter can in there and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna wait for work for like an hour but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like fifteen minutes you know</p>
<p>especially with your</p>
<p>heart rate is up it goes really fast so</p>
<p>at the moment i stepped into the ring i go like</p>
<p>oh no it&rsquo;s back you know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna do this again</p>
<p>you know so i did it on them</p>
<p>at the moment they</p>
<p>would call my name</p>
<p>i would put it in and then hopefully i was not</p>
<p>gonna feel it fuck yeah</p>
<p>so you were</p>
<p>fighting on lidocaine to</p>
<p>shoot it in you and then</p>
<p>fight right here because you</p>
<p>could walk you know</p>
<p>i made a really bad trip</p>
<p>when i was running the day before i jumped on the plane</p>
<p>and it was against</p>
<p>vernon tiger</p>
<p>white it was like my fourth</p>
<p>fight or something somewhere there</p>
<p>and and it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s unbelievable</p>
<p>he takes me down and he goes for a toe hold and that</p>
<p>angle like i mean it&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m sending out a signal</p>
<p>you know take this</p>
<p>thing this is a</p>
<p>weird signal because whenever i get a tattoo</p>
<p>somebody fucking slaps me</p>
<p>arm with a tattoo it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>if you have an injury</p>
<p>here where you</p>
<p>never get hit if you</p>
<p>spar you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get hit there</p>
<p>it is what it is if you hurt</p>
<p>your hand for sure someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna squeeze it when they</p>
<p>shake it yeah</p>
<p>sure what it is</p>
<p>a lot of times you go a</p>
<p>whole year without a guy giving you one of</p>
<p>those douchey handshakes</p>
<p>you know those douchey handshakes where</p>
<p>he grabs a tip of your face what</p>
<p>the fuck is that</p>
<p>about insecure and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll go a year for that but if you hurt your hand</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s right away that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>first thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen the guys wait is that it</p>
<p>fucking strange it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>same you got two lines you always pick the line that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the longest way yeah</p>
<p>this one is way longer you take</p>
<p>the shortest and</p>
<p>this guy goes for a</p>
<p>break and the fucking replacement</p>
<p>comes in they got to redo the register yeah the</p>
<p>check the old</p>
<p>grandmother you know</p>
<p>what is the</p>
<p>title how much</p>
<p>again oh oh</p>
<p>sorry i got</p>
<p>take another one when i see people paying with</p>
<p>checks i&rsquo;m like why don&rsquo;t you just fucking whip out</p>
<p>beaver pelts i cannot</p>
<p>i saw one the</p>
<p>other day at the grocery store</p>
<p>like really</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>using this yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where last time i saw it too was at the grocery</p>
<p>store when it</p>
<p>checks people</p>
<p>allow you to just</p>
<p>write on a piece of</p>
<p>paper yeah the big lebowski</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like 70 nights</p>
<p>on that milk yeah</p>
<p>the opening movie</p>
<p>the opening shot</p>
<p>so if you didn&rsquo;t have all</p>
<p>these injuries do you</p>
<p>think you would have kept</p>
<p>going or do you</p>
<p>think i think i</p>
<p>would have kept going a</p>
<p>few more years yeah because</p>
<p>it was not a problem</p>
<p>not having stamina and</p>
<p>you know i always been very blessed</p>
<p>with my body</p>
<p>you know like people look at me now the</p>
<p>whole time and they say oh my god how much you</p>
<p>train well i didn&rsquo;t train for</p>
<p>a year you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like i i just</p>
<p>genetically</p>
<p>put together because</p>
<p>of my dad my brother has the same he&rsquo;s a lawyer but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same he&rsquo;s got no fat just good</p>
<p>just good base good genes yeah they&rsquo;re all athletes</p>
<p>the root inside you know so yeah</p>
<p>never had a problem with that</p>
<p>what was the question</p>
<p>the question was whether or not you would keep</p>
<p>going oh yeah no i would</p>
<p>yeah because</p>
<p>you know like i said there&rsquo;s nothing like it</p>
<p>but at the moment</p>
<p>the fun is gone out of</p>
<p>training training</p>
<p>would be so much fun for me</p>
<p>because you know somebody</p>
<p>everything you know when you roll</p>
<p>every time something pops up oh god that&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>yeah man and it&rsquo;s a new thing</p>
<p>and then you start</p>
<p>using a lot of people and it</p>
<p>works and it works and it works and it works oh my god</p>
<p>this is great you know and</p>
<p>every time a new little</p>
<p>thing or somebody shows you</p>
<p>another little thing like</p>
<p>a guilty joke do it like this because they can escape</p>
<p>no sergio painted</p>
<p>show to me i go wow</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like bizarre</p>
<p>things that i get that</p>
<p>whole expression yeah</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so cool but on the way you have to pain the</p>
<p>whole time it takes the pleasure out of it and</p>
<p>once you have no more fun</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the use of</p>
<p>still keeping</p>
<p>so you can&rsquo;t roll it all</p>
<p>right now no no and</p>
<p>especially just</p>
<p>after my surgery i get what</p>
<p>this surgery is the same surgery from the daryl golar</p>
<p>incident that you just had i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>think it added on</p>
<p>maybe you know</p>
<p>that was the</p>
<p>first time it got hurt though</p>
<p>yeah what was the actual surgery</p>
<p>would they have done</p>
<p>between c four and five and five and six my</p>
<p>nerves were flat squashed</p>
<p>so i lost at two</p>
<p>feet my whole arm</p>
<p>and shoulder</p>
<p>so now they honk</p>
<p>the holes open around it they make so that the</p>
<p>nerves are they can breathe</p>
<p>again so a lot of guys get that</p>
<p>the jose aldo just got that he has a</p>
<p>nerve issue as well</p>
<p>no arms going</p>
<p>numb and carwin</p>
<p>carwin had it as well he just had surgery on it carwin</p>
<p>did oh my god that for jose aldo</p>
<p>base one of my favorite guys</p>
<p>good that&rsquo;s not good man this is a bad injury</p>
<p>because this is</p>
<p>gonna take a long time i mean</p>
<p>this is over two</p>
<p>months ago and i</p>
<p>i noticed things like i could</p>
<p>push brush my</p>
<p>teeth harder</p>
<p>push a little bit harder when i</p>
<p>watch under my armpit</p>
<p>or i can shave my</p>
<p>whole head now with a</p>
<p>razor blade</p>
<p>which i couldn&rsquo;t do before</p>
<p>things like that but</p>
<p>power wise i do 15</p>
<p>pounds that&rsquo;s it wow</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>weak so when you roll around it&rsquo;s not fun you know</p>
<p>of course they attack that arm there we go</p>
<p>again murph&rsquo;s law yeah</p>
<p>everybody goes on that i had</p>
<p>giga musashi was</p>
<p>over and his brother and his brother said that nobody</p>
<p>could they could</p>
<p>break his grip at an armbar i have a really</p>
<p>weird way of putting</p>
<p>an armbar on but the way i do it nobody can escape</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>i do that i control the hand i make sure that the</p>
<p>elbow points up</p>
<p>you know and i control the such</p>
<p>way that your arm you can get out i can</p>
<p>just cover your face the</p>
<p>other leg i just can put away</p>
<p>and you still can get out really</p>
<p>yeah and he said to me</p>
<p>oh but you can do it on me so i&rsquo;m trying trying i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>break because</p>
<p>apparently he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>known for it&rsquo;s very strong</p>
<p>and he says she see a guy say</p>
<p>flip around</p>
<p>he says why i said this is my</p>
<p>wrong arm so i</p>
<p>could you decide to go</p>
<p>i got him in the arm by right away</p>
<p>i said listen i can do fifteen</p>
<p>pounds with this you know it&rsquo;s a very weak arm</p>
<p>right now so is it eventually</p>
<p>gonna come back to hundred percent you know if</p>
<p>they say it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>millimeter a day</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>months ago so that will be six</p>
<p>centimeters</p>
<p>go starting from my neck</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gotta go all the way to here</p>
<p>six centimeters of what of healing of healing the</p>
<p>nerve heals like a</p>
<p>millimeter a day they say</p>
<p>okay yeah so nine</p>
<p>months to a year i</p>
<p>should expect</p>
<p>at least he said he says</p>
<p>it comes back because i was very late with it</p>
<p>they misdiagnosed me</p>
<p>so i walked around with this</p>
<p>thing for a long time</p>
<p>so what is the</p>
<p>thing though what was the actual injury so</p>
<p>the compression of the compression</p>
<p>and the pain all the hard pain that i had</p>
<p>that was the</p>
<p>nerve apparently is a</p>
<p>whole bunch of</p>
<p>little cables he says and outside there&rsquo;s the pain</p>
<p>thing you know once you</p>
<p>squish that you know you&rsquo;re already really far gone</p>
<p>and that happened with me i had no pain anymore</p>
<p>and he says man that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>worst thing because</p>
<p>that means that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>already died so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>damaging and you don&rsquo;t even feel it that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>wow so then they go in there and they</p>
<p>drill it out and then you have to wait forever</p>
<p>for it to heal up yeah</p>
<p>wow and there&rsquo;s nothing you can do in between time</p>
<p>you just have to</p>
<p>let it go nothing i</p>
<p>started actually</p>
<p>yesterday and i think</p>
<p>two days ago i</p>
<p>started running on a treadmill</p>
<p>but only with the incline</p>
<p>so i can roll in</p>
<p>the balls of my feet so i don&rsquo;t have my knee shocking</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m actually feeling okay</p>
<p>today my knees so i figure okay if i can do that</p>
<p>then i can at</p>
<p>least start doing my</p>
<p>sprints again</p>
<p>i used to be a</p>
<p>freak man i</p>
<p>could ease these</p>
<p>what i do is</p>
<p>i run 10 miles</p>
<p>10 minutes 11</p>
<p>miles an hour that&rsquo;s the warm up</p>
<p>and then i jump off i</p>
<p>start stretching</p>
<p>while i put the incline all the way up go to 9</p>
<p>miles an hour</p>
<p>and then i jump on for 45 seconds</p>
<p>and off for 30</p>
<p>and i do those 10</p>
<p>ten of those rounds and</p>
<p>after that i run like five minutes to run it out</p>
<p>done take a five</p>
<p>minute break and i do my</p>
<p>power training workout this is what when i was</p>
<p>the top of my game</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really hard</p>
<p>so you would do your</p>
<p>sprints first and then you</p>
<p>would do your</p>
<p>power training</p>
<p>later yeah that everybody thought it was</p>
<p>weird but for me</p>
<p>if you do the</p>
<p>power training</p>
<p>first it hinders you with your running</p>
<p>sometimes i</p>
<p>would do it to mimic</p>
<p>the fight because that&rsquo;s what i think</p>
<p>is the biggest problem with a lot of guys</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t realize that you</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re pumping of it</p>
<p>you should do apps a lot of apps before you fight</p>
<p>and stretch them out</p>
<p>because what happens is your abs they</p>
<p>start filling up with like that behind your abs or your</p>
<p>lungs and that&rsquo;s why you see the roid guys</p>
<p>because they have that boop</p>
<p>right away they go strong</p>
<p>boom and then they drop</p>
<p>and i think it really is because of the apps</p>
<p>because if they</p>
<p>do ten times this it stays like this</p>
<p>right it bumps up</p>
<p>well imagine that happens to your core</p>
<p>and with everything</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fighting you</p>
<p>using your core take down defense everything</p>
<p>so that stops blowing up stops your</p>
<p>lungs from breathing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why you</p>
<p>get tired so you</p>
<p>think cabs are important for stamina that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying very important to keep him loose</p>
<p>to keep him</p>
<p>loose and to stretch him out this is very important</p>
<p>i would take before a</p>
<p>fight also aspirin</p>
<p>you know to make my</p>
<p>blood thin because</p>
<p>in thai boxing i</p>
<p>would never</p>
<p>wear wraps i don&rsquo;t like to have wraps around me so i</p>
<p>go bare knuckle in the gloves</p>
<p>and with the</p>
<p>shoes i hated</p>
<p>those things you know this was totally japanese rules</p>
<p>right the penguin</p>
<p>shoes yeah because what happens is</p>
<p>those japanese guys they&rsquo;re really good on the ground</p>
<p>and so they say okay and the</p>
<p>striking not so</p>
<p>okay so let&rsquo;s put them on</p>
<p>shin guards let put them on knee</p>
<p>protection and push</p>
<p>shoes because they&rsquo;re good with leg locks</p>
<p>and no gloves because then they&rsquo;re good for the rear</p>
<p>naked chokes and all</p>
<p>i mean they&rsquo;re totally</p>
<p>adapted when i left bankrose i think two</p>
<p>three months</p>
<p>later it was they</p>
<p>changed the rules it was closed fist</p>
<p>and i go whoa</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been waiting</p>
<p>for a long time for this yeah they had to try to</p>
<p>adapt to be</p>
<p>mixed martial arts yep</p>
<p>eventually so is it pancreas</p>
<p>where you hurt your knees</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t know i have no clue i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m so i&rsquo;m very explosive</p>
<p>and i think over the years that just</p>
<p>scraped off and my things are bold they say they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>bleeding bone marrow out of on me</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like yeah it&rsquo;s like very painful man it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not fun do you do any</p>
<p>other martial arts exercise i know you have that</p>
<p>thing that you sell</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s part of it because you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to hit things</p>
<p>right exactly like that yeah because it has no impact</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>the tendonitis</p>
<p>right every fighter</p>
<p>should use that thing like 12 days before the</p>
<p>fight not that</p>
<p>heavy back anymore</p>
<p>just when accidents happen you know you get tired</p>
<p>sweat on the back but your</p>
<p>gloves and slips or the</p>
<p>wrist hurts</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>things happen with a</p>
<p>heavy back and they like to hit a heavy bag</p>
<p>which i did also because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a cool thing but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>that moment when you hit really hard like a</p>
<p>liver shot and you feel think</p>
<p>right then i know okay tomorrow i got the ten and i</p>
<p>did you develop this</p>
<p>thing this what it&rsquo;s called the boss</p>
<p>system what is it what does it stand for</p>
<p>the body action stand</p>
<p>so what happened was this</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a long time ago a long time ago like</p>
<p>four years or something ago</p>
<p>my agent tells me</p>
<p>that this woman</p>
<p>wants to see me they have a product and it</p>
<p>started out with a stand</p>
<p>with two of</p>
<p>those kicking</p>
<p>things she knows like</p>
<p>one though yeah two</p>
<p>so i came to her</p>
<p>and i was hangover</p>
<p>hungover it was</p>
<p>the last period that i was</p>
<p>still drinking</p>
<p>and i walk in i said okay i&rsquo;m telling you</p>
<p>right now because you can breathe it</p>
<p>you can smell it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a little hangover</p>
<p>let me take a look at this</p>
<p>thing and i&rsquo;ll call you back tomorrow</p>
<p>what i think</p>
<p>so i looked at the</p>
<p>thing and the next day</p>
<p>i called back i said okay now this what we</p>
<p>should do and had this whole list</p>
<p>ready and she goes like whoa whoa whoa</p>
<p>we thought you didn&rsquo;t notice anything yesterday</p>
<p>i said no and then i came up to do a head to do a body</p>
<p>patch you know and make</p>
<p>targets on there and</p>
<p>you know but then it</p>
<p>starts because people</p>
<p>think this is an easy product</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s knockoffs from</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>right they&rsquo;re already selling knockoffs</p>
<p>if you buy that</p>
<p>thing then you really that was like our early</p>
<p>stages what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna flop around they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna break because</p>
<p>you need to find a spring</p>
<p>that is just</p>
<p>right to not</p>
<p>be too floppy</p>
<p>and not too</p>
<p>stiff if it&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>stiff the whole</p>
<p>stand will move</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s too floppy you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>knock it for the</p>
<p>second punch because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still moving</p>
<p>you know it needs to be just right</p>
<p>now the foam in there needs to be just</p>
<p>right now foam</p>
<p>the density</p>
<p>the density</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s really tight foam it&rsquo;s heavier</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>if you say okay</p>
<p>is this a little bit too hard i want different</p>
<p>foam to put different foam but now because it&rsquo;s lighter</p>
<p>then the spring needs to be</p>
<p>changed again so</p>
<p>every time i got like</p>
<p>eight prototypes and i have to</p>
<p>train on those</p>
<p>things the whole time to see</p>
<p>and find out</p>
<p>which is what</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>best weight and the best form with what spring</p>
<p>it took two and a half years</p>
<p>two and a half years to find that</p>
<p>they hit that</p>
<p>thing i mean</p>
<p>thirty thousand time with the machine dong</p>
<p>dong dong that</p>
<p>thing when you buy it won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>break two guys</p>
<p>there was two heads broke</p>
<p>but that was from a shipment that we</p>
<p>right away took</p>
<p>out because it was something with the glue that</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t connect with</p>
<p>it was vaporizing or eating the glue</p>
<p>so it didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work it was too only we sent a new head back and we</p>
<p>never we saw a lot of</p>
<p>those things we have no problems no problem do you use</p>
<p>those yourself do you use them</p>
<p>every time when i</p>
<p>train yeah now</p>
<p>right now i can&rsquo;t i use a lot</p>
<p>i can do hooks like see that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird weird</p>
<p>angle for me and uppercuts</p>
<p>if i make ten</p>
<p>uppercuts the last</p>
<p>uppercut goes slow up because it&rsquo;s yes</p>
<p>biceps now you really realize</p>
<p>that you need your biceps in</p>
<p>order to put your body weight into a punch</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t lock it up now</p>
<p>a straight punch i&rsquo;m okay with but hooks</p>
<p>i can hit with a</p>
<p>glove i can hit you as hard as i want to your</p>
<p>belly you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna go down</p>
<p>wow yeah it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s pathetic when i look at it like why did you</p>
<p>like having no wraps on</p>
<p>i always have</p>
<p>that i want to have</p>
<p>my blood flow</p>
<p>keep going for</p>
<p>some reason i have the feeling that this happens</p>
<p>that it doesn&rsquo;t circulate any more</p>
<p>naturally it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a bad feeling when you get a tight wrap when it&rsquo;s tight</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t like it at all</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t need it if you hit the</p>
<p>right way all</p>
<p>these guys are so</p>
<p>like tyson i always give the example just</p>
<p>learn how to</p>
<p>hit the correct way and nothing will happen these guys</p>
<p>they come in</p>
<p>the room and they got the special guys that</p>
<p>they got a stitch there on call</p>
<p>every day two times a day</p>
<p>rep the hands perfect he can hit it in any</p>
<p>angle it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>so then when</p>
<p>this guy that&rsquo;s why when he had a</p>
<p>street fight he</p>
<p>would always</p>
<p>break his hand</p>
<p>right tyson</p>
<p>because he doesn&rsquo;t know how to</p>
<p>hit he hits him with a</p>
<p>pinky or whatever</p>
<p>wrong technique</p>
<p>but isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>hard when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fighting because</p>
<p>guys move and sometimes you wanted to hit them with</p>
<p>these two knuckles but you accidentally</p>
<p>catch them with the last</p>
<p>knuckle you know of course</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>especially in karate</p>
<p>with the cue cucine karate</p>
<p>is sparring in its bare knuckle</p>
<p>and some of</p>
<p>these guys they have a gi</p>
<p>and some guys have</p>
<p>their hips here right</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s how i</p>
<p>broke this one also you hit a hip you</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;ve got the liver</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a head bone yeah that that hurt that will</p>
<p>that was a good</p>
<p>thing it makes martial arts because now you can see</p>
<p>what you hit</p>
<p>everything that you</p>
<p>started out you</p>
<p>started out in taekwondo</p>
<p>is that what you</p>
<p>like window</p>
<p>that was my</p>
<p>first sport yeah</p>
<p>i did that for about</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know four</p>
<p>weeks or six weeks and i was already beating up the</p>
<p>brown bells</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>understand my parents are very conservative</p>
<p>they would never</p>
<p>allow me to do</p>
<p>martial arts</p>
<p>but i always got bullets</p>
<p>and i saw a</p>
<p>bruce lee movie in 76</p>
<p>i entered the dragon</p>
<p>in france when</p>
<p>we were on the holiday and i came out and</p>
<p>said that&rsquo;s it i want to be</p>
<p>bruce lee you know</p>
<p>so i made these nunchucks</p>
<p>and i was only</p>
<p>like kung fu</p>
<p>shoes i had all nolans i was really so</p>
<p>i asked my parents please please please please but they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t allow me so i kept</p>
<p>going kept go</p>
<p>training myself so</p>
<p>watching moves and just kept training</p>
<p>and then finally</p>
<p>after two years they said okay</p>
<p>you know stop asking questions</p>
<p>go we had a neighbor</p>
<p>the girl next</p>
<p>door she had a boyfriend was the cool guy from the town</p>
<p>and he said okay come with me are you two in kind of</p>
<p>under a swing</p>
<p>and it went really good i</p>
<p>started being up like i said the brown belts out</p>
<p>within six weeks</p>
<p>says man you got a good feeling so my</p>
<p>confidence rose and</p>
<p>at that moment i was</p>
<p>riding my bike on the street</p>
<p>and the biggest</p>
<p>bully comes with six of his bodies or something</p>
<p>and they said something</p>
<p>and i shouted something back</p>
<p>and they all laugh were</p>
<p>laughing and they right away came</p>
<p>after me and</p>
<p>when i saw them coming for me i stopped my bike</p>
<p>and i put it down</p>
<p>and i was just waiting for the guy</p>
<p>and then the biggest</p>
<p>bully comes to me and he&rsquo;s put you know that the</p>
<p>early days you push with your chest</p>
<p>right and he pushed</p>
<p>against my chest and i go</p>
<p>puff and he goes down</p>
<p>broke his nose out</p>
<p>anybody more</p>
<p>nobody did anything</p>
<p>i come home police was already home waiting</p>
<p>and that was it</p>
<p>no more taekwondo for me so when i</p>
<p>moved out of</p>
<p>house when i</p>
<p>was twenty one</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s when i</p>
<p>started fighting</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you</p>
<p>start kickboxing and</p>
<p>everything else</p>
<p>kickboxing yeah muay</p>
<p>thai and how did you</p>
<p>transition into pancreas</p>
<p>where&rsquo;d that come about</p>
<p>you know this is oh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cool we got time</p>
<p>right yeah okay cool now</p>
<p>let me go back let me see</p>
<p>i was fighting</p>
<p>thai boxing in holland</p>
<p>i want a lot of</p>
<p>fights but not</p>
<p>like my first fourteen</p>
<p>fights of one by</p>
<p>knock after</p>
<p>thirteen in the</p>
<p>first round</p>
<p>round one i was sick</p>
<p>what was your your</p>
<p>final kick boxing record when you sixteen</p>
<p>sixteen and two</p>
<p>no fourteen wins two losses</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>i fought this guy</p>
<p>who was in jail for a long time frank lupman</p>
<p>very powerful fighter</p>
<p>had a record like 52 with like</p>
<p>three losses and like 48 knockouts a monster</p>
<p>now apparently i was a bouncer at the time</p>
<p>apparently on new year&rsquo;s day when i was</p>
<p>bouncing i was also drunk</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s an example</p>
<p>and somebody asked me if i wanted to fight him</p>
<p>and i said sure so in</p>
<p>i think like the end of january i get a phone call they</p>
<p>asked me where to send the posters to</p>
<p>and i said what posters</p>
<p>from the fights so who&rsquo;s gonna fight</p>
<p>you against lotman</p>
<p>and i go who said that</p>
<p>he said you you told me that you gonna fight for</p>
<p>so now they had posters already i go like okay</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>might as well</p>
<p>yeah i gotta do it now because</p>
<p>otherwise you&rsquo;re gonna think i&rsquo;m scared right</p>
<p>so i had about</p>
<p>five weeks to train now you gotta understand that</p>
<p>i got tired</p>
<p>from jumping rope the first time i was so out of</p>
<p>shape it was not even funny</p>
<p>so anyway i go to the</p>
<p>fights and i just had my knee my shin</p>
<p>at this here there was a huge hole</p>
<p>i i did some</p>
<p>crazy stuff on a wall there was a wall i jumped on i</p>
<p>i was always really good in jumping up like a randleman</p>
<p>did you know i could jump this high like my chest here</p>
<p>i would stand in front of it and jump on a wall</p>
<p>but it had been raining and i jumped on and my toes</p>
<p>slid up and i landed on my shin on it</p>
<p>so the rip my shin open</p>
<p>so the day of the fight was all wild</p>
<p>flash and we had the tape you know and</p>
<p>it was like super glue and everything and my</p>
<p>friend says okay lidocaine</p>
<p>there it is again right</p>
<p>he says you know i said just</p>
<p>put it around he says no we&rsquo;ll numb up the whole leg</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>about it he says and he said he put it in my butt</p>
<p>so he says no</p>
<p>the leg would be numb</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll see that fight</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see that fight</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like jumping</p>
<p>i never jump when i fight</p>
<p>and the whole time</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m shaking</p>
<p>my leg and i can&rsquo;t feel my leg it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>weirdest thing you know</p>
<p>oh no so then</p>
<p>they said there was a</p>
<p>knock i was knock i</p>
<p>would you look at the</p>
<p>fight you&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think he even hits me</p>
<p>but i am landing on my</p>
<p>butt and i want to get up and i can&rsquo;t get up my my leg</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>and i go whoa</p>
<p>you know i said man my leg</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work you know so and the referee</p>
<p>says stop the fight</p>
<p>then all the people</p>
<p>start saying see i always said</p>
<p>that he cannot fight</p>
<p>so that really bug me</p>
<p>of course anyway</p>
<p>i said okay i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>fight another</p>
<p>fight shouldn&rsquo;t have done that either because on the</p>
<p>three days or four days before the</p>
<p>fight i helped the body of my out</p>
<p>they really</p>
<p>beat the crap out of me at this</p>
<p>jaw all the way wired</p>
<p>you know and his</p>
<p>mouth was closed so</p>
<p>we went to the guys who did it and we got in a little</p>
<p>scuffle there of course and they</p>
<p>threw me in jail for a couple of days into jail</p>
<p>one is why you can&rsquo;t get in canada right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a long time ago</p>
<p>in the jail i had for some reason i got an infection</p>
<p>in one of my testicles</p>
<p>whoa and it became like really big</p>
<p>and it was hurting a lot and they let me out</p>
<p>you know because</p>
<p>it was only a few days it was they did the</p>
<p>whole test they</p>
<p>found out that you</p>
<p>know what the guys did they say you know what we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna</p>
<p>bring it to court you</p>
<p>know they kind of felt</p>
<p>that we were</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>doing what we did</p>
<p>anyway i still fought and i shouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>taken a fight i</p>
<p>knocked the guy down</p>
<p>three times in the first</p>
<p>round and then</p>
<p>and then actually i win</p>
<p>i make a spinning of</p>
<p>a breakfast oh yeah that was it</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s standing in</p>
<p>front of me and i&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>tired to know my body so i&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>tired and i</p>
<p>go boom i make give him a breakfast in his neck</p>
<p>and he goes down</p>
<p>and i so i think i want to fight and</p>
<p>apparently like a</p>
<p>month before there was a rule that if you did a bat</p>
<p>fist you only</p>
<p>could do it with the turn some bullshit</p>
<p>yeah it was bullshit anyway</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t come out for the</p>
<p>second round because i was too</p>
<p>tired and they said okay</p>
<p>now it really</p>
<p>started holland</p>
<p>you see i always said</p>
<p>he was not so good a blah blah</p>
<p>but i said okay i</p>
<p>never fight for holland</p>
<p>anymore this is over you know</p>
<p>if these fans</p>
<p>are like this i don&rsquo;t want to fight in</p>
<p>front of people like this</p>
<p>but i was always</p>
<p>yeah it is because you know it&rsquo;s your life it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and but it was always that</p>
<p>i wanted to do something with martial arts while</p>
<p>buddy of mine</p>
<p>we both together we made the show it&rsquo;s like an</p>
<p>a martial arts show</p>
<p>on music and we start doing this in like nightclubs</p>
<p>and we would like but really cool</p>
<p>really cool stuff i would kick him in the belly like</p>
<p>bruce lee and that</p>
<p>dragon right he would grab my foot</p>
<p>throw me back and i would make his flying kick</p>
<p>in his face and land and</p>
<p>you know we did all that cool</p>
<p>stuff we would come on with like</p>
<p>a cartwheel flick flick and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the way we would opt to walk to the place</p>
<p>and we had bows and we did nunchucks and we did like</p>
<p>brake tests the</p>
<p>crazy stuff and little cups on his mouth i</p>
<p>would kick back spinning back here and jump up and</p>
<p>jumping flying back the cup off his head</p>
<p>good quality martial arts but we start</p>
<p>putting comedy in there also</p>
<p>like funny things that</p>
<p>for instance i would i would</p>
<p>stand there very serious with an</p>
<p>suit and i go go get the cups</p>
<p>and the guy would come back and he had done</p>
<p>these little cups and i</p>
<p>kept looking straight to go no</p>
<p>the other ones</p>
<p>what the other ones and you go okay</p>
<p>so that he would walk and he</p>
<p>would come back with cops like this he like butts</p>
<p>stuff like that we start doing stuff like that and</p>
<p>he moved to heaven this is also a funny one</p>
<p>i would do a break test the same</p>
<p>thing you know he would come with the break test and go</p>
<p>take the other ones</p>
<p>so then he came back and he had like</p>
<p>these these wooden</p>
<p>things that were this thick you know little</p>
<p>things and he would</p>
<p>spread them out like a deck card</p>
<p>and i would like pick one right</p>
<p>and he would hold it</p>
<p>and then i would stand in front of it and i go</p>
<p>and he would buy because of fear</p>
<p>he will break it already know</p>
<p>stuff like that we would do</p>
<p>and that caught on real fast people really started</p>
<p>seem to like that</p>
<p>so suddenly we were doing this on bigger shows</p>
<p>first at nightclubs then we</p>
<p>start doing it on shows like</p>
<p>events big events</p>
<p>rob came and</p>
<p>when he was fighting i</p>
<p>think that when he had the main event one time</p>
<p>we were in the break</p>
<p>you know showing this to the people so they got aired</p>
<p>and then we were on dutch tv and then</p>
<p>euro sports saw it and they had an event</p>
<p>yearly in in france</p>
<p>and we went to there and we started</p>
<p>traveling now and doing the shows all over the place</p>
<p>and comedy was always the</p>
<p>thing once we</p>
<p>start doing</p>
<p>the comedy people will know me there&rsquo;s a few of</p>
<p>those things on youtube actually</p>
<p>so on one of</p>
<p>these shows because we came up with all</p>
<p>these flipflex and somersault and all that stuff</p>
<p>chris dolman was sitting there</p>
<p>and chris dolman is one of the forefathers in holland</p>
<p>he was a judo</p>
<p>champion tough guy</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>he called me to</p>
<p>him and he says man you got some really good abilities</p>
<p>man did you ever</p>
<p>think about free</p>
<p>fighting you know what it is he says no</p>
<p>he said well we do that in japan</p>
<p>are you interested i say</p>
<p>sure because they go okay that&rsquo;s not holland</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s japan right</p>
<p>so he says come and</p>
<p>try it out so i walk in there and at that moment i was</p>
<p>european champion thai boxing</p>
<p>so it was because the</p>
<p>those two fights</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t for a title</p>
<p>so i thought i was the cool dude</p>
<p>and and that was</p>
<p>literally like always</p>
<p>grace in the beginning you know i walk in</p>
<p>and they killed me</p>
<p>and they will put on</p>
<p>these jokes not</p>
<p>blood jokes but like</p>
<p>on my went pipe you</p>
<p>know and pulling pulling pulling because long as</p>
<p>no grappling back then zero</p>
<p>did you know that they were</p>
<p>gonna grapple when you went there</p>
<p>no no nothing nothing i had no clue</p>
<p>i saw them on the ground and then they say okay just go</p>
<p>wow i know so you showed</p>
<p>up you just thought it was just some kind of a</p>
<p>crazy fight you had no idea</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re training and i</p>
<p>literally when i</p>
<p>drove back i had</p>
<p>to stop my car next to the road and i had one of the</p>
<p>first phillips telephone</p>
<p>cell phones it was really cool at the time</p>
<p>you remember this</p>
<p>pretty big nose</p>
<p>and i called my wife i said listen um um</p>
<p>if my car next</p>
<p>to the road here i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna sleep</p>
<p>i said i can drive it</p>
<p>broke me it really</p>
<p>i i had to drink</p>
<p>liquid food for like</p>
<p>three days because my</p>
<p>whole throat was messed up because i thought i</p>
<p>could hold that</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>i was just fighting it and they were pulling pulling</p>
<p>till yeah that and</p>
<p>i would that but it was all</p>
<p>crushed up and</p>
<p>and my wife was already left and she says</p>
<p>okay so that&rsquo;s it right</p>
<p>i said no no i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go back</p>
<p>and within six months</p>
<p>three six months i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna tap everybody there</p>
<p>you know because i want to</p>
<p>learn this i want to</p>
<p>learn this game but things</p>
<p>started happening and i got an injury here an injury</p>
<p>there and i had to work and i was a</p>
<p>bouncer and you know</p>
<p>once a month i</p>
<p>would go over there</p>
<p>it kind of fade away</p>
<p>then my wife looks at me or</p>
<p>in the beginning of our career</p>
<p>and she says</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be a</p>
<p>famous fighter in</p>
<p>japan and i go</p>
<p>well but you say that she says</p>
<p>that just came up with me i said no i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna fight anymore i told you she said yeah you</p>
<p>you said holland</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna go to japan</p>
<p>six months after she made that comment</p>
<p>i get a phone call and i</p>
<p>never pick up the phone</p>
<p>and the answering machine was broke</p>
<p>or turned off because my</p>
<p>crazy ex wife</p>
<p>was calling all the time so i didn&rsquo;t turn on</p>
<p>so i get the</p>
<p>i pick up the</p>
<p>phone for some reason</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s crystal</p>
<p>money says boss</p>
<p>you got to come</p>
<p>tonight you got to come to the amsterdam</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a tryout there&rsquo;s two guys here</p>
<p>suzuki for now</p>
<p>looking for</p>
<p>fighters for a new organization bankers</p>
<p>so i went to the tryout</p>
<p>i had a scuffle with one of the rings</p>
<p>champion because</p>
<p>they were fighting for rings</p>
<p>but it was a lot of work i</p>
<p>heard already</p>
<p>that they were having works</p>
<p>which by works you mean fixed</p>
<p>fights fixed</p>
<p>fights there was a lot of that in pancreas</p>
<p>right no in there wasn&rsquo;t rings in pancreas</p>
<p>i will come back to that</p>
<p>no no i believe so that there was</p>
<p>but enough what the people said like they</p>
<p>never asked me</p>
<p>well i&rsquo;ll come back to that</p>
<p>also anyway</p>
<p>because he told me</p>
<p>right there he says you know it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>gonna ask you a little bit</p>
<p>later if you want to lose</p>
<p>fight anyway i</p>
<p>started sparring with this guy this</p>
<p>guy was a rings</p>
<p>champion he</p>
<p>tried to hurt me because they were filming</p>
<p>result was me</p>
<p>knocking him out with a high kick</p>
<p>boom and his his</p>
<p>whole eyebrow was open he had to go to the hospital for</p>
<p>stages suzuki</p>
<p>ifnaki i saw him</p>
<p>pointing at me so</p>
<p>they wanted me</p>
<p>i think two</p>
<p>months two and a half months</p>
<p>later i was in</p>
<p>japan and before i went i got that</p>
<p>speech from chris nomine</p>
<p>said they&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>gonna ask you</p>
<p>you know to lose or to win a</p>
<p>fight i said chris</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to do that</p>
<p>if i want to</p>
<p>if i fight it needs to be real</p>
<p>otherwise i don&rsquo;t i hated those guys</p>
<p>who were there</p>
<p>and they they</p>
<p>would come back and</p>
<p>they would say</p>
<p>yeah became</p>
<p>champion and and i said</p>
<p>they were all cool</p>
<p>but then when they came back and they had to lose they</p>
<p>would come back and they say yeah i lost but you know</p>
<p>you know they</p>
<p>i had to lose yeah</p>
<p>last time they made you win</p>
<p>you know but you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>say that but you only say it when you lose so i hated</p>
<p>those guys with that</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re not a real guy</p>
<p>so i knocked the</p>
<p>first guy out</p>
<p>and in the second</p>
<p>fight i knocked the</p>
<p>other guy out</p>
<p>fukai and then by the way we had dinner with funakya</p>
<p>suzuki and gaga here we go</p>
<p>you know so dinner they gave me a book from</p>
<p>fujiwara a really good</p>
<p>wrestler and we had</p>
<p>great dinner and then they put me on a cap</p>
<p>and just before they walked in i go whoa</p>
<p>i said i thought you guys were</p>
<p>gonna ask me</p>
<p>so he said what do you mean he says well chris tom</p>
<p>told me that</p>
<p>you know that</p>
<p>do you probably</p>
<p>gonna ask to to</p>
<p>to throw the</p>
<p>fight at suzuki</p>
<p>told me straight in my face</p>
<p>i will never ask you</p>
<p>such a thing</p>
<p>says we will</p>
<p>never do that</p>
<p>now over the years i&rsquo;ve been hearing of course and some</p>
<p>fights when you look at</p>
<p>fights it looks really</p>
<p>smooth and going over</p>
<p>and like can</p>
<p>shamrock said he lost</p>
<p>also he lost</p>
<p>the lost fights were all works</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s also you go like okay</p>
<p>he lost twice by exactly the same combination</p>
<p>he looked into a knee bar</p>
<p>against the same</p>
<p>opponent and you go like</p>
<p>if it was a</p>
<p>not real wouldn&rsquo;t you come up with something else</p>
<p>would you really do two times the same</p>
<p>you see so that&rsquo;s been also in my head</p>
<p>did you ever see bart vale</p>
<p>versus ken shamrock</p>
<p>no it looks so fake</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>early ones that</p>
<p>looks really like a work there&rsquo;s a few that look like a</p>
<p>really like a</p>
<p>work that&rsquo;s one of them</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;ve seen the ones in</p>
<p>pride like remember when coleman</p>
<p>found oh gotta</p>
<p>gotta you were before</p>
<p>were you commentating on that one</p>
<p>oh my god i hated my guts because it was the funniest</p>
<p>thing ever we knew that coleman was</p>
<p>gonna lose in six minutes with a heel hook right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s was the word i</p>
<p>heard that so</p>
<p>when the reporters came in</p>
<p>they asked me what do you</p>
<p>think is gonna win</p>
<p>and i say i</p>
<p>think the car is</p>
<p>gonna win in</p>
<p>about six minutes with the helo</p>
<p>and i command around and they they</p>
<p>changed it but like faster or something</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really didn&rsquo;t like that that i was doing that</p>
<p>but i go like that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>again i can</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i get sometimes</p>
<p>i get emotional from it when people say oh it was fake</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>worst one what they say is</p>
<p>yeah but sometimes</p>
<p>it was fake and buzz didn&rsquo;t know of it</p>
<p>so they told the</p>
<p>opponent to lose</p>
<p>against buzz</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>against i fought</p>
<p>against funaki</p>
<p>and then one guy said one time he said</p>
<p>yeah that was the work because he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hurt you i said</p>
<p>when did he decide</p>
<p>that he was</p>
<p>gonna lose was it before off he tried</p>
<p>to break my</p>
<p>freaking leg</p>
<p>i mean i know if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>if you see the fight</p>
<p>he pushed me in a heel hook and inverted heel hook</p>
<p>with the toes in his neck</p>
<p>and my heel is</p>
<p>180 degrees there i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>literally looking at my own leg</p>
<p>and i go oh my god i don&rsquo;t feel it you know</p>
<p>that i thought</p>
<p>nobody else</p>
<p>that was a big risk what he was</p>
<p>going to take if this was a fake</p>
<p>fight right</p>
<p>i needed it like two or</p>
<p>three times so you&rsquo;ll see my leg</p>
<p>completely be turned the</p>
<p>other way did you suffer any damage because</p>
<p>no i have no clue however</p>
<p>this heel hook is one of the</p>
<p>worst it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>worst one i broke this</p>
<p>this i&rsquo;m walking on the</p>
<p>street right</p>
<p>and we should</p>
<p>certainly be here with all the</p>
<p>fighters here</p>
<p>hybrids wrestling bankrose</p>
<p>and we look at is this</p>
<p>giant screen</p>
<p>and the first</p>
<p>thing you see is me</p>
<p>bath giving a bomb</p>
<p>strike and the</p>
<p>guy goes down and we go yeah you know that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>promo for the next day</p>
<p>so i see this guy take a high</p>
<p>she sitting</p>
<p>in a half guard</p>
<p>and he grabs a heel</p>
<p>and he falls back</p>
<p>and i go this is the time i had nobody to roll with</p>
<p>right i trained on the back</p>
<p>two times a day my</p>
<p>first year in the heaven</p>
<p>bank was was me</p>
<p>training on a back pretty much</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s wrestling no no</p>
<p>no pretty much</p>
<p>nothing like would you</p>
<p>rolling around if there was somebody who knew judo</p>
<p>he would come</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about once every</p>
<p>three weeks</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not kidding</p>
<p>so next day i&rsquo;m in that position</p>
<p>and i go up</p>
<p>might as well try it</p>
<p>right so i grab that heel but since i</p>
<p>never did it</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t realize how much pressure i put on</p>
<p>so i grab it and i fall back</p>
<p>using my body weight i snap the shin in half</p>
<p>so first we hear we have go cock</p>
<p>you know so i go</p>
<p>up you see me letting go</p>
<p>and then he feels his knee</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you wanna fight you say yeah</p>
<p>but i go like</p>
<p>dude i hurt</p>
<p>your knee snap because we thought it was a knee</p>
<p>but apparently it was</p>
<p>still like a little</p>
<p>stuck on that leg so then he kicks with that leg</p>
<p>and i flex my muscle</p>
<p>you see the</p>
<p>and then when he puts a foot down it</p>
<p>bounce all the way out you know</p>
<p>like that i&rsquo;ve seen that</p>
<p>a few times well</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen a few times with</p>
<p>checked legs only in person once corey hill</p>
<p>and who the</p>
<p>fight i forget</p>
<p>we fought prince</p>
<p>no what the hell&rsquo;s his name anyway</p>
<p>whoever he fought he he checks</p>
<p>his kick and cory hills leg snaps backwards the</p>
<p>referee didn&rsquo;t even see it</p>
<p>so cory goes down the</p>
<p>referee was in a bad</p>
<p>angle we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>screaming stop the</p>
<p>fight referee</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t even know and he&rsquo;s just on his back like</p>
<p>freaking out that&rsquo;s dangerous man</p>
<p>especially the shin when it&rsquo;s splintered</p>
<p>you know and it hits a wrong</p>
<p>oh yeah you can bleed</p>
<p>out you can bleed out</p>
<p>the guy here</p>
<p>that you showed me i think</p>
<p>on twitter you sent</p>
<p>a tweet with the guy who was</p>
<p>fighting with the broken arm</p>
<p>yeah remember</p>
<p>how tough is that dude</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t feel it then the referee</p>
<p>saw it in around</p>
<p>three and then they stopped the</p>
<p>fight but this guy was just</p>
<p>going annihilating the</p>
<p>other guy with it</p>
<p>it was unbelievable</p>
<p>both these guys were actually really good</p>
<p>i go what organization was that</p>
<p>well you know</p>
<p>rich franklin when he fought</p>
<p>chuck liddell</p>
<p>you got his</p>
<p>army punched</p>
<p>chuck with it</p>
<p>after it was broken yeah</p>
<p>god so you went and</p>
<p>after you your</p>
<p>fighting career was done then you</p>
<p>started doing the commentary</p>
<p>in in japan you had a couple</p>
<p>fights after that</p>
<p>the the ruben villarreal</p>
<p>fight you had in the wfa</p>
<p>yeah and what what happened was that i</p>
<p>would have mark kerr and marco</p>
<p>huas and beto</p>
<p>hezo and all</p>
<p>these guys they were</p>
<p>training with us</p>
<p>at the beverly hills jujutsu club and i</p>
<p>would train</p>
<p>those guys and i</p>
<p>would go with them as cornerman</p>
<p>and in in japan when you when you</p>
<p>fight you see the</p>
<p>fights are on in the</p>
<p>dressing room</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m sitting i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>watching there and yukino</p>
<p>and hideki those two guys the people</p>
<p>from pride who live in america you know who are</p>
<p>in between persons are the same</p>
<p>are there also</p>
<p>and i go like oh look at that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna go for straight arm bar</p>
<p>sounds right arm</p>
<p>watch out watch out there he comes here we</p>
<p>come boom and the guy&rsquo;s got straight arm</p>
<p>so they look at me</p>
<p>and then the next</p>
<p>fight it&rsquo;s right away also</p>
<p>again i said oh my god he&rsquo;s looking for a knee bar</p>
<p>oh he&rsquo;s gonna roll in life but she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna roll he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna go for any but</p>
<p>i showed a few rolls and</p>
<p>it goes for anybody and they go like how do you notice</p>
<p>i said you can see the setup</p>
<p>and they look at each</p>
<p>other and said</p>
<p>did you ever</p>
<p>think about being a commentator</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>i got the job who was doing it before you</p>
<p>nobody because</p>
<p>they were looking at that moment they were looking at</p>
<p>at new people because they had the first</p>
<p>nine or something</p>
<p>quadros and i we did that in a studio</p>
<p>later you know</p>
<p>yeah but but i we i think the</p>
<p>first one was um</p>
<p>cause that no</p>
<p>eddie did it with quadros for a</p>
<p>while eddie bravo</p>
<p>he did it also yeah and you came in and</p>
<p>which gracie</p>
<p>which gracie there was the</p>
<p>first one i was there</p>
<p>that was the</p>
<p>first one i</p>
<p>think that got broadcast</p>
<p>into the state</p>
<p>now this is it</p>
<p>after you&rsquo;d fought in the ufc</p>
<p>after you&rsquo;d won the</p>
<p>title did you were you</p>
<p>completely done i mean you obviously had another</p>
<p>fight in the wfa</p>
<p>after that what was it like</p>
<p>being there and</p>
<p>pride during the</p>
<p>glory days and you know did you think</p>
<p>about making comebacks</p>
<p>cause i know there was a talk</p>
<p>yeah yeah no i did i did it was two times two times</p>
<p>one time it was against</p>
<p>evangelist silva yeah</p>
<p>because they needed an</p>
<p>opponent for him that was at the event</p>
<p>that dynamite of a 91 and a half thousand people man</p>
<p>life outside crazy</p>
<p>you know and i couldn&rsquo;t find an</p>
<p>opponent and i said listen i did a role for a long time</p>
<p>because i have</p>
<p>problems i said but everybody wants to see a</p>
<p>strike anyway</p>
<p>why and and</p>
<p>was also at the same god was k one you remember jerome</p>
<p>the better was</p>
<p>fighting don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fight k one rules</p>
<p>so i said so why don&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>do k one rules</p>
<p>with mma gloves</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what the people want to see anyway you know from us too</p>
<p>but then that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why i didn&rsquo;t go through they they took somebody else</p>
<p>and yeah that</p>
<p>would have been awesome and because at that time</p>
<p>man i i was</p>
<p>i was hurting like</p>
<p>a guy holds</p>
<p>the tide patch i mean it</p>
<p>would have purple arms he</p>
<p>was go my god this is no fun anymore you know because</p>
<p>i was in shape</p>
<p>you know i had a real good</p>
<p>stand man fuck that</p>
<p>would have been a</p>
<p>great fight</p>
<p>against vandale</p>
<p>holy shit a pure</p>
<p>stand up fight</p>
<p>and then and then</p>
<p>when ken came to</p>
<p>pride i was the</p>
<p>first one to say</p>
<p>i say i come out of retirement if you if i can find him</p>
<p>but can&rsquo;t say no we did it already twice</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t need to do it the third time</p>
<p>really so he declined to fight in</p>
<p>pride with you yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what he came personally to tell me he says boss</p>
<p>i told him that i didn&rsquo;t want to do because we were</p>
<p>ready for two times</p>
<p>what does that mean yep</p>
<p>and you fought pancreas you</p>
<p>never fought an mma</p>
<p>i would have</p>
<p>but also at that time i was a totally different</p>
<p>fighter like you can&rsquo;t fight</p>
<p>against me made me who i am that</p>
<p>fight was like</p>
<p>literally god was</p>
<p>watching and he says okay i give you this one guy to</p>
<p>train with in holland</p>
<p>nineteen year old</p>
<p>leon van dijk</p>
<p>freaking monster he did</p>
<p>on a machine with two hundred and</p>
<p>seventy five</p>
<p>pounds you would do curls</p>
<p>it was bizarre i</p>
<p>would have him in an armbar</p>
<p>and i better do two hands because he</p>
<p>literally would</p>
<p>start doing this</p>
<p>this is insanely</p>
<p>strong and i</p>
<p>started training</p>
<p>both we didn&rsquo;t know anything and we</p>
<p>would watch tapes</p>
<p>i would watch tapes and i</p>
<p>would see a heel hoop for instance</p>
<p>i would write down how it works</p>
<p>next day we</p>
<p>start rolling i</p>
<p>would go heel hook</p>
<p>go heel hook</p>
<p>i say okay now let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>break this down let&rsquo;s see how we can make it better</p>
<p>okay how can you escape well if i push</p>
<p>this way okay so how can i stop you from doing this</p>
<p>and we start</p>
<p>breaking down</p>
<p>every little</p>
<p>thing i say okay you</p>
<p>basically did it by yourself</p>
<p>describe everything</p>
<p>no high level instruction at all nothing</p>
<p>i did everything myself and</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s the cool part because</p>
<p>one time i got a</p>
<p>phone call when my big dvds of combat come out</p>
<p>and i was at the time and bj fourth met use</p>
<p>all the way back</p>
<p>and bj called me and i say hey boss is bj said</p>
<p>bj pen yeah i said wow i say</p>
<p>where do i oh this pleasure for</p>
<p>is i just want to</p>
<p>tell you made the best instruction that i&rsquo;ve ever seen</p>
<p>i said man that is so cool he says you</p>
<p>gotta go i gotta do my run</p>
<p>so whoa let me can i use your quote</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s simple but that&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>stuff and i</p>
<p>saw and i realized also that a lot of people</p>
<p>a lot of fighters took</p>
<p>everything straight out</p>
<p>jiu jitsu and they put it into</p>
<p>mixed martial arts and a lot of</p>
<p>stuff straight out</p>
<p>jiu jitsu doesn&rsquo;t work it makes martial arts because</p>
<p>it needs to be more compact</p>
<p>like the sleeve</p>
<p>will take care that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>harder for you to roll out of an armbar so that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>armbars with me i always control the inside of the hand</p>
<p>so you can rotate your hand whatever</p>
<p>armbar pretty much i do it&rsquo;s always control control</p>
<p>because i don&rsquo;t want it to rotate</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>with helix we</p>
<p>start breaking</p>
<p>everything down and i say okay</p>
<p>if i would tap in for</p>
<p>instance with</p>
<p>an armbar from the mountain</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just making something up</p>
<p>he would after</p>
<p>three times he</p>
<p>would know my setup</p>
<p>so i would create a different way</p>
<p>to go to the</p>
<p>downbar he would find that one</p>
<p>out and then i</p>
<p>would create a different way</p>
<p>so then certainly i start for</p>
<p>every move i</p>
<p>start having</p>
<p>three or four different ways to go to that</p>
<p>submission and then i</p>
<p>start tossing</p>
<p>those around</p>
<p>that seems so</p>
<p>crazy it&rsquo;s like you had to</p>
<p>learn jiu jitsu on your own</p>
<p>on my own you had to figure it out</p>
<p>like look at how people were doing it and deconstruct</p>
<p>it and then my next</p>
<p>eight fights i</p>
<p>trained for</p>
<p>three months i think</p>
<p>two times a day sometimes i</p>
<p>would wake up at</p>
<p>night would call him</p>
<p>and we go around</p>
<p>he think i was always game always</p>
<p>and we would train</p>
<p>and my next</p>
<p>eight fights i won by submission</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>so when did you ever get real</p>
<p>legitimate jiu</p>
<p>jitsu instruction did you get someone</p>
<p>never never</p>
<p>never yeah your</p>
<p>whole career yourself</p>
<p>taught yeah</p>
<p>everything that&rsquo;s cool wow</p>
<p>and the cool part and</p>
<p>i always said is because i&rsquo;m very</p>
<p>proud of it and that&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;m saying it</p>
<p>as you if you look at the record</p>
<p>in pancras that rope escapes</p>
<p>right that means</p>
<p>that if you</p>
<p>could get in a</p>
<p>choke but you could</p>
<p>touch the rope</p>
<p>they had to</p>
<p>let you go it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous but</p>
<p>but on the other side</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really good for you as a</p>
<p>fighter to develop</p>
<p>because now you have to make be more</p>
<p>strategical now you have to make sure that you have</p>
<p>him in the center of the ring before you go so then</p>
<p>again if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna miss it</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the center of the ring</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>thinking which sometimes i</p>
<p>wanna fight</p>
<p>with like four</p>
<p>submissions</p>
<p>so instead of</p>
<p>going out there i had now four</p>
<p>submission victories pretty much in one</p>
<p>fight and i</p>
<p>think that that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>the pancras guys were so good in</p>
<p>uc i think six or seven</p>
<p>guys from pancras became all</p>
<p>ufc champion</p>
<p>because they</p>
<p>of that rule i</p>
<p>truly believe</p>
<p>i know it&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>i always said as long as i don&rsquo;t get have to escape</p>
<p>because if i</p>
<p>escaped for me that</p>
<p>would feel like a loss</p>
<p>but i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see so even</p>
<p>allowing them to escape</p>
<p>to you it&rsquo;s good because it just means you get more</p>
<p>submission work in yeah</p>
<p>i have another</p>
<p>fight now so</p>
<p>you have more</p>
<p>fights so you feel like you won you</p>
<p>won already and now let&rsquo;s do it and let&rsquo;s do it again</p>
<p>and then if you look at the ways i submitted people</p>
<p>you can call a</p>
<p>submission okay</p>
<p>a go go plot i didn&rsquo;t do but you can come up with some</p>
<p>crazy stuff</p>
<p>i put it every</p>
<p>he looks normally he looks inverted knee bar triangle</p>
<p>choke triangle armbar</p>
<p>figure force</p>
<p>how many fights did you have over in pancraz</p>
<p>uh 31 31 yeah</p>
<p>holy shit over the course of how many years that</p>
<p>was only over the course of five years i fought the</p>
<p>first year i fought nine</p>
<p>fights and the</p>
<p>second nine</p>
<p>again and that</p>
<p>night eight</p>
<p>again i mean how did i</p>
<p>go i thought that in a pretty</p>
<p>short time so by the time you got to the ufc</p>
<p>you had a shitload</p>
<p>of fights like all the muay thai</p>
<p>fights all the pancreas</p>
<p>fights and then finally you got to fight</p>
<p>mma style finally because i</p>
<p>i want to go to the ufc</p>
<p>for the for the</p>
<p>entrance song</p>
<p>i kid you not i thought that was the coolest</p>
<p>thing old original</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m do do</p>
<p>do from eindhoven holland</p>
<p>you know and i go</p>
<p>i want to come up with that song that is so cool</p>
<p>and that really that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>they came ask me i said but that was the</p>
<p>the deciding factor that i said okay i wouldn&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>because i just love that song</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>promoted the shit out of you when you first came</p>
<p>i remember that i gave you one of the posters</p>
<p>brian sold it on ebay i used to have the</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s best martial</p>
<p>art greatest martial artist</p>
<p>but it was cool and and i had a</p>
<p>great idea i had that the three two norse</p>
<p>you know pavarotti and all</p>
<p>these guys they had this they did a tour</p>
<p>and on one of those tracks i like to be in america</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a 43</p>
<p>second clip</p>
<p>and i told him</p>
<p>i said i like to be in america you know and i thought</p>
<p>okay please let me put on that clip for 43</p>
<p>seconds and then the</p>
<p>ufc tuner comes up i mean i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna score</p>
<p>here in america</p>
<p>right i was so</p>
<p>worried about your opening</p>
<p>music oh man that was it for</p>
<p>every fighter i always got that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right did you</p>
<p>read the script already for</p>
<p>kevin&rsquo;s movie</p>
<p>no i haven&rsquo;t read it okay because you&rsquo;re in it</p>

<p>trained with you a</p>
<p>bunch of times</p>

<p>apartment which he shared with another guy</p>
<p>yeah and now he lives in the</p>

<p>same guy i know</p>
<p>kevin since he was</p>
<p>basically an open micer i was the one who talked to</p>
<p>my manager into signing him</p>
<p>oh wow you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>only been doing comedy just like me we were both</p>
<p>basically open micers</p>
<p>we had done a little bit of professional work but</p>
<p>i mean we&rsquo;ve been doing comedy two</p>
<p>three years</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really an open micer that&rsquo;s getting paid</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re an amateur</p>
<p>basically that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>kevin and i met we men like</p>
<p>shit 91 maybe 92</p>
<p>yeah he said</p>
<p>that you and he</p>
<p>would watch the pancreas</p>
<p>fights all that together</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah that used</p>
<p>to come over my</p>
<p>house and then seen</p>
<p>him we would</p>
<p>watch him man</p>
<p>i had a buddy of mine from canada</p>
<p>who would get them from</p>
<p>japan he had</p>
<p>a connection in</p>
<p>japan so he</p>
<p>would get them they</p>
<p>would send them to canada and then he</p>
<p>would send them from canada to me</p>
<p>and then we would</p>
<p>watch them at my</p>
<p>house got all japanese commentary you know i</p>
<p>watched all of them i</p>
<p>watched you know i did get a</p>
<p>stack of them</p>
<p>every month</p>
<p>yeah this was before i was even working for the</p>
<p>ufc there was</p>
<p>a you know before i ever even</p>
<p>started thinking</p>
<p>about doing commentary yeah</p>
<p>yeah we were just fans that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how did you ever get in there because you went</p>
<p>from fear factor</p>
<p>before that</p>
<p>i started working in 97 before you came to the ufc i</p>
<p>done the post</p>
<p>fight interviews</p>
<p>for about two years</p>
<p>i started at</p>
<p>ufc 12 dolton alabama vitor</p>
<p>belfort&rsquo;s debut</p>
<p>okay and i did it then i was on news</p>
<p>radio and what</p>
<p>happened was they just needed a guy to do the post</p>
<p>fight interviews</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have anybody and my manager was friends</p>
<p>with the guy</p>
<p>who the same guy who signed kevin</p>
<p>my manager was friends with the guy who was one</p>
<p>of the producers of the show this guy campbell mclaren</p>
<p>who was also the guy who</p>
<p>tried to get me to</p>
<p>fight wesley snipes one day so</p>
<p>they needed someone to do the post</p>
<p>fight interviews</p>
<p>and so he just</p>
<p>sent me to fucking alabama</p>
<p>out of nowhere and before you know what i&rsquo;m doing it</p>
<p>was very unorganized though it&rsquo;s not like the ufc today</p>
<p>i did it for</p>
<p>maybe two years but i saw a lot of</p>
<p>great fights you</p>
<p>know shamrock vs an ovia i saw</p>
<p>frank i saw</p>
<p>randy kotor&rsquo;s debut</p>
<p>vito belford&rsquo;s debut</p>
<p>dan henderson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>debut amino&rsquo;s there for a lot of</p>
<p>great great</p>
<p>fights but it</p>
<p>started to cost me</p>
<p>money so i quit it was like i</p>
<p>would make more</p>
<p>money doing comedy than that so</p>
<p>it was a little too and i was</p>
<p>on newsradio at the time the sitcom so i was too busy</p>
<p>so i quit and then when the</p>
<p>ufc came along</p>
<p>when zufer rather purchased the ufc then</p>
<p>i started working for them</p>
<p>that was tough</p>
<p>and when did you fear</p>
<p>fear factor that was at that time also</p>
<p>yeah to fear factor</p>
<p>was 2001 i believe it</p>
<p>started and</p>
<p>i was already on</p>
<p>fear factor when i</p>
<p>started working for the</p>
<p>ufc i did it</p>
<p>as a favor the</p>
<p>first i think</p>
<p>eight shows i did for free yeah</p>
<p>i just said</p>
<p>you know they wanted me to do commentary and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>all right i&rsquo;ll do it i&rsquo;ll sit in there i&rsquo;ll yeah</p>
<p>just was just talking you know</p>
<p>yeah really honestly i shouldn&rsquo;t have been paid for the</p>
<p>first ones i wasn&rsquo;t really good</p>
<p>yeah no but</p>
<p>still you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the same as</p>
<p>fighting you</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>about money but</p>
<p>until you know something</p>
<p>you go like okay well actually she&rsquo;s get paid for it</p>
<p>then it became you know</p>
<p>that became the</p>
<p>thing that i</p>
<p>enjoyed most</p>
<p>i mean it was like</p>
<p>stand up comedy i</p>
<p>enjoy the most i&rsquo;ll always be a fan of</p>
<p>mixed martial arts even when i&rsquo;m not doing</p>
<p>if i retire</p>
<p>one day and stop doing commentary i&rsquo;m always</p>
<p>gonna watch the</p>
<p>fight i&rsquo;m always</p>
<p>gonna be a fan</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m always</p>
<p>gonna do stand up</p>
<p>comedy as a professional so that&rsquo;s my number one thing</p>
<p>but other than that</p>
<p>all the things that i&rsquo;ve ever done in my life like a</p>
<p>ufc or a fear factor or a news radio or</p>
<p>the ufc&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>greatest fucking job ever i mean i love it</p>
<p>i always loved it also in</p>
<p>japan i will say tomorrow i</p>
<p>would say tomorrow</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re the only two</p>
<p>in six billion</p>
<p>right now who see</p>
<p>freaking fader</p>
<p>versus crow</p>
<p>cop yeah oh</p>
<p>fader and no</p>
<p>guerra you know those epic</p>
<p>fights and and vandal a silver</p>
<p>annihilating you know</p>
<p>sakuraba like wow</p>
<p>crazy stuff and they were</p>
<p>there for some</p>
<p>prime oh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pride in the</p>
<p>for people who don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t aware of</p>
<p>pride pride</p>
<p>in the heyday</p>
<p>was one of the best if not the best</p>
<p>organization in the</p>
<p>world because</p>
<p>they had so many different rules</p>
<p>first of all there were a lot of</p>
<p>things that i like</p>
<p>they had 10 minutes for the first</p>
<p>round i like that</p>
<p>because then</p>
<p>a lot of times a guy</p>
<p>would take a guy down with five minutes</p>
<p>into the fight and then the</p>
<p>round would end yeah</p>
<p>you know and he was just</p>
<p>starting to get</p>
<p>impose his part of the game yeah</p>
<p>but in the in the the</p>
<p>pride rules they</p>
<p>would give him a full ten</p>
<p>minute first round and</p>
<p>they allowed soccer kicks and</p>
<p>stomps i mean it was a lot</p>
<p>more displays and no</p>
<p>elbows on the ground no elbows</p>
<p>you have less cuts</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it that&rsquo;s what i always</p>
<p>say i want to have the maloneys</p>
<p>underground you know</p>
<p>and get away from the guts yeah we know how many</p>
<p>knockouts that you see with an</p>
<p>elbow right five</p>
<p>yeah if that yeah ever</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s a good weapon i mean look john</p>
<p>jones when he used it on</p>
<p>branded vera i mean he broke his</p>
<p>orbital bone oh yeah no</p>
<p>but that but that&rsquo;s then one of the five</p>
<p>mmm yeah name the</p>
<p>other four yeah see not</p>
<p>that many yeah but yeah</p>
<p>but a lot of</p>
<p>fights get stopped by cuts</p>
<p>and a lot of guys and i hate that because of the on the</p>
<p>street you wouldn&rsquo;t stop if you get</p>
<p>cut you keep on</p>
<p>fighting you know it&rsquo;s not a real win</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna discard</p>
<p>guys who make careers out of it you know</p>
<p>but still it&rsquo;s an effective weapon</p>
<p>i feel like you can&rsquo;t take it away either because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so good it&rsquo;s a good technique</p>
<p>but okay maybe what they</p>
<p>should do is</p>
<p>yeah but again they don&rsquo;t pad that</p>
<p>elbow so something around it that at</p>
<p>least it doesn&rsquo;t cut i&rsquo;m totally for it if you</p>
<p>knock them out man</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m the biggest guy</p>
<p>but not like laying on somebody</p>
<p>and literally do</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even load them up</p>
<p>right right just rub them rub them rub</p>
<p>them and then they get cut and they win the fight yeah</p>
<p>i want to find no you didn&rsquo;t win the fight</p>
<p>for me it didn&rsquo;t win that</p>
<p>fight do you</p>
<p>think they could</p>
<p>solve that with a neoprene</p>
<p>sleeve on the the</p>
<p>elbow maybe</p>
<p>with a problem</p>
<p>is you know it&rsquo;s like this</p>
<p>crazy time we tie</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>have arrived</p>
<p>you know that always</p>
<p>starts moving</p>
<p>wing and around it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>annoying people</p>
<p>gotta you know</p>
<p>maybe surgically</p>
<p>they have to</p>
<p>implant one</p>
<p>surgically implant a pad over your elbow</p>
<p>man it&rsquo;s hot</p>
<p>here or not</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s you you&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>fired up yeah this is</p>
<p>awesome i like this</p>
<p>so you did two</p>
<p>fights in the ufc</p>
<p>after you won the</p>
<p>title with random and what</p>
<p>made you stop</p>
<p>pain pain pain</p>
<p>pain that neck injury</p>
<p>i brought it all the way to the randelman</p>
<p>fight and it was</p>
<p>still not gone it was hurting i couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sleep i wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sleeping pills for such a long time because of</p>
<p>the pain there was always pain pain in my neck</p>
<p>and then i said you know what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna so i tore</p>
<p>biceps like</p>
<p>throwing the left hook in the air pocket and go</p>
<p>oh my god what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on now you know i stopped</p>
<p>breaking down</p>
<p>breaking down</p>
<p>and then i started</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t do anything</p>
<p>then i started</p>
<p>training like</p>
<p>three years</p>
<p>after that i</p>
<p>started training and it went</p>
<p>start going good and the ground start</p>
<p>going good and</p>
<p>you know okay</p>
<p>everything feels good</p>
<p>and then i stopped</p>
<p>and then like two years later</p>
<p>two and a half years</p>
<p>later they that&rsquo;s when they call me for the wfa</p>
<p>if i was interested</p>
<p>they offered me a lot of</p>
<p>money and and</p>
<p>apparently what happened it was</p>
<p>funny also because they</p>
<p>came earlier polo</p>
<p>to him they said</p>
<p>he says who do you want to</p>
<p>fight and i said</p>
<p>hixon no at</p>
<p>first i said hixon</p>
<p>right they said we don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>money for that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never gonna happen</p>
<p>i said okay then</p>
<p>hixon&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>right he wants millions of</p>
<p>yeah that was at the time</p>
<p>you know and i was just want to see what you can do</p>
<p>against him right</p>
<p>and so they</p>
<p>by the way that</p>
<p>would have been another awesome</p>
<p>fight that would have been awesome fight</p>
<p>holy shit you</p>
<p>against van</p>
<p>delay or you</p>
<p>against oh shit</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s a shame</p>
<p>anyway then i said</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>so you thought villareal</p>
<p>so no no no they said</p>
<p>kimberly apollo</p>
<p>positive for steroids yeah but</p>
<p>when they said kimberly</p>
<p>polish are you sure i said</p>
<p>when i just hang out with them in</p>
<p>japan when he fought in</p>
<p>japan it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>weird i said no no no he actually wants to</p>
<p>fight you i said oh cool</p>
<p>so then when we get the</p>
<p>photo shoot i go to the</p>
<p>photo shoot and he&rsquo;s there and he&rsquo;s acting all</p>
<p>weird like giving me hand but like</p>
<p>shying away and</p>
<p>i go like wow he&rsquo;s taking</p>
<p>this fight very serious</p>
<p>right i mean what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on oh yeah we told him that you specifically</p>
<p>asked for him</p>
<p>i said why would you do that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>and then i thought you know what</p>
<p>am i gonna tell him</p>
<p>but then i said no i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna tell him because if i tell him</p>
<p>you know then</p>
<p>maybe he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna train us hard i wanted to have a</p>
<p>tough fight</p>
<p>you know so i thought he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>angry he&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>train harder there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be awesome fight</p>
<p>and then i thought</p>
<p>that was my</p>
<p>crazy mind i say on the day of the fight</p>
<p>i would deliver a letter to him in the</p>
<p>the dressing room</p>
<p>saying exactly what i just said so he</p>
<p>would read like i</p>
<p>i knew this already but i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna tell you</p>
<p>because i want you to be a hundred percent</p>
<p>before you fight me and a full of stamina because you</p>
<p>gonna need it</p>
<p>and that way i</p>
<p>think that would be totally backfiring right</p>
<p>away just before you fight</p>
<p>so that was the</p>
<p>setup to to play</p>
<p>and then yeah he got tested positive</p>
<p>so that was so</p>
<p>that ruben had to take his</p>
<p>place ruben</p>
<p>took it now</p>
<p>no there were a lot of guys that gabbit</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t want to do it and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>bunch of guys they went over because i said anybody</p>
<p>they came up with that because i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>so ruben was just the only one who was</p>
<p>willing to take the fight yeah</p>
<p>now when you were over there in</p>
<p>japan and you were were there for all</p>
<p>those great</p>
<p>fights like no</p>
<p>guerra versus</p>
<p>no guerra versus crow cop and</p>
<p>no guerra versus fade or and</p>
<p>what was that</p>
<p>like sitting there ringside i mean did you</p>
<p>want to just fucking jump in there sometimes no you get</p>
<p>crazy you get</p>
<p>crazy you get you</p>
<p>you were over there for some of the greatest</p>
<p>fights ever ever</p>
<p>ever and nobody gets to take that away from you</p>
<p>what they said</p>
<p>about my fights also i want to fight the</p>
<p>first two fights in</p>
<p>bankers and one guy in holland</p>
<p>says he said boss</p>
<p>everybody was saying oh he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna lose he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna lose he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna lose you know like a very negative</p>
<p>public country</p>
<p>and one guy says boss whatever happens</p>
<p>they never take this away from you anymore</p>
<p>so lock this up they got you got this you know</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s with</p>
<p>those fights also that&rsquo;s something that you</p>
<p>carry on with the rest of your life they were</p>
<p>great moments</p>
<p>and to interview</p>
<p>those guys you know</p>
<p>to reenact with</p>
<p>them and do</p>
<p>crazy stuff and then</p>
<p>when i inquire to</p>
<p>start doing</p>
<p>these crazy openings you</p>
<p>know yeah those</p>
<p>were fun man i liked those no</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>those cause</p>
<p>they pulled</p>
<p>those things out there was that</p>
<p>jerry millen came</p>
<p>out that guy yeah you know</p>
<p>he was certainly everything</p>
<p>the same as boxing</p>
<p>and i go why is it</p>
<p>gonna be the same as everybody else you know</p>
<p>let it be like</p>
<p>how many fights did you do over there in</p>
<p>pride how many</p>
<p>cards oh god i don&rsquo;t know i mean it but when they</p>
<p>started bushido</p>
<p>also i was there</p>
<p>twelve times a</p>
<p>month a year</p>
<p>every month i was like five six i</p>
<p>yeah i have no clue but during</p>
<p>the heyday it must have been</p>
<p>completely insane i mean i</p>
<p>heard stories</p>
<p>about guys getting paid with</p>
<p>stacks of money</p>
<p>stacks of money was crazy</p>
<p>old chris bold numbers</p>
<p>exactly in a row</p>
<p>i mean i think</p>
<p>if they would walk in there</p>
<p>with guns but yeah then again</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to do that i guess</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>money there</p>
<p>japan is run by the yakuza</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>whole deal with</p>
<p>pride and all</p>
<p>these organizations they&rsquo;re basically</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s accepted that&rsquo;s a part of japanese culture</p>
<p>right is that just how it works no no no no</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not accepted</p>
<p>because when it came out</p>
<p>then it was over right</p>
<p>then because then the tv said</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want to be associated with it</p>
<p>and they pulled the</p>
<p>money out or was it was that just</p>
<p>because it was made public but it was already known i</p>
<p>think it was made public i gotta</p>
<p>forget this it was</p>
<p>the pass from joe rogan</p>
<p>for a buddy of mine</p>
<p>oh yeah i gave him a</p>
<p>ufc password yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>is that your</p>
<p>phone that keeps</p>
<p>going on i have no</p>
<p>clue let me see</p>
<p>oh my battery&rsquo;s too low for use</p>
<p>okay good i&rsquo;ll turn it out</p>
<p>so when you were over there though when you were</p>
<p>watching all</p>
<p>these classic</p>
<p>fights i mean like i said you&rsquo;d been there for</p>
<p>i mean you were there for</p>
<p>shogun mark coleman</p>
<p>you were there for</p>
<p>shogun versus rampage rampage</p>
<p>versus arona i mean</p>
<p>some of the</p>
<p>greatest fights of all time</p>
<p>rampage the</p>
<p>things that we did with rampage how</p>
<p>you know i remember my first</p>
<p>when he fought</p>
<p>sakuraba and he lost that fight</p>
<p>i took him to the side i</p>
<p>said listen</p>
<p>you got it man</p>
<p>you got this</p>
<p>thing they love you</p>
<p>i say make sure this</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t happen anymore</p>
<p>because they actually had to get him out of jail</p>
<p>to get that</p>
<p>fight there was a</p>
<p>whole stress thing</p>
<p>going on because he</p>
<p>had a warrant</p>
<p>out of him or something and he was at the airport</p>
<p>and they got him and they put him in jail</p>
<p>really yeah but at the</p>
<p>pride people</p>
<p>started talking they got him out they made</p>
<p>pictures of it</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s standing in</p>
<p>front of the jail</p>
<p>it was on the</p>
<p>cover of all the newspapers he was</p>
<p>standing there with his big chain</p>
<p>you know and that was</p>
<p>that was quentin</p>
<p>he came in now</p>
<p>the what was</p>
<p>going on back then</p>
<p>at that time was</p>
<p>pride was a</p>
<p>mainstream japanese sensation</p>
<p>it was huge in mainstream</p>
<p>japan right it wasn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>mixed martial arts in america back then</p>
<p>was not nearly as</p>
<p>successful as it is</p>
<p>today oh you</p>
<p>a small show</p>
<p>was 43 000 people</p>
<p>damn yeah and they</p>
<p>would sell out</p>
<p>all the time the biggest show 91 and a half</p>
<p>tokyo dome 55 60 000</p>
<p>i mean it was</p>
<p>crazy and you</p>
<p>would go out on the</p>
<p>street and you</p>
<p>would get mobbed it was oh man</p>
<p>everywhere everybody yeah</p>
<p>so what happened what happened over there</p>
<p>cause it stopped being</p>
<p>like that it stopped being like because of that i i</p>
<p>because the yakuza</p>
<p>yeah when when</p>
<p>when the tv pulled</p>
<p>everything out</p>
<p>it was over</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>everything went down to</p>
<p>dread but it was so</p>
<p>successful so</p>
<p>many people liked it i couldn&rsquo;t imagine that</p>
<p>someone else</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t come</p>
<p>along no no no no no i</p>
<p>think the main reason of this</p>
<p>is sakuraba</p>
<p>started to lose</p>
<p>you like an organization in</p>
<p>japan in order to be</p>
<p>successful they</p>
<p>need japanese star star</p>
<p>and where you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>fight good luck</p>
<p>to find another</p>
<p>sakuraba who beat for gracie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not unbelievable fighter</p>
<p>you know but it is k one</p>
<p>never got big</p>
<p>in america why they don&rsquo;t have an american champion</p>
<p>right they have an american</p>
<p>champion in america k one</p>
<p>but that guy</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t do good</p>
<p>at the final tournament</p>
<p>so but once an american guy</p>
<p>is going to win in japan</p>
<p>you watch then</p>
<p>k1 becomes very interesting for the people and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>logic you know you want to root for your own guy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>though because</p>
<p>i mean horse gracie when he won</p>
<p>in america he was a hugely</p>
<p>popular guy and he&rsquo;s from brazil yeah i</p>
<p>think if they had k1 over in america i just</p>
<p>think people</p>
<p>dana white and i had a conversation</p>
<p>about this when he was talking about how</p>
<p>kickboxing has a negative stigma in america</p>
<p>because of pka</p>
<p>karate the old</p>
<p>boring kickboxing that</p>
<p>used to have on</p>
<p>es8 gigs above the</p>
<p>waist or something</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t even kick low</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t kick</p>
<p>low at all very few of the</p>
<p>i mean they</p>
<p>would occasionally they</p>
<p>would show you a low kick</p>
<p>fight you know</p>
<p>allow like special rules or special rule</p>
<p>dutch rules yeah</p>
<p>for the most part it was like they</p>
<p>would wear those big</p>
<p>stupid slippers on</p>
<p>their feet yeah</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t really kick it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exciting wasn&rsquo;t really as</p>
<p>exciting as boxing or muay</p>
<p>thai but the k1</p>
<p>now if you watch the</p>
<p>grand prix now that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bizarre so so best</p>
<p>show ever so</p>
<p>exciting best</p>
<p>show and max as well you know the k1 max</p>
<p>every later</p>
<p>week guys and it&rsquo;s georgia</p>
<p>petrosian i mean shit</p>
<p>unbelievable</p>
<p>right tell me that guy couldn&rsquo;t be a star in america or</p>
<p>you know alistair</p>
<p>especially yeah but</p>
<p>the thing is</p>
<p>in the beginning</p>
<p>it will work</p>
<p>but eventually</p>
<p>people want to see an american</p>
<p>champion well i</p>
<p>think maybe</p>
<p>if it was really big and</p>
<p>successful over here you</p>
<p>would have you know some americans that</p>
<p>would do well</p>
<p>but they would have to</p>
<p>they would have to know that that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>legitimate avenue for a</p>
<p>profession you know guys</p>
<p>like that barry</p>
<p>you know guys who are real</p>
<p>serious fucking</p>
<p>strikers you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not that many of them</p>
<p>there is not no there&rsquo;s really not</p>
<p>and you know the</p>
<p>in america it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>venue they have</p>
<p>to go out of the country to get like real high</p>
<p>level it&rsquo;s very hard</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very maury</p>
<p>smith would say</p>
<p>you know he was at the top of the pyramid at the time</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>it over there so then you know they go like okay well</p>
<p>guess who was</p>
<p>gonna beat maury</p>
<p>smith in america</p>
<p>nobody right</p>
<p>right yeah maurice</p>
<p>that was he was another interesting guy when he</p>
<p>first came to the ufc</p>

<p>debut i was there when he fought mark coleman</p>
<p>nobody gave</p>
<p>him a chance you know everybody thought more he&rsquo;s</p>

<p>but maurice</p>
<p>just it was the</p>
<p>first guy to have like that real high</p>
<p>level cardio</p>

<p>first guy that just not get</p>

<p>and it goes</p>
<p>real fast and</p>
<p>right away i give him a high kick</p>
<p>boof and it&rsquo;s on his defense</p>

<p>and i kick and i slip and i fall on the ground</p>
<p>and he wants to jump on top of me and i go wait</p>

<p>laugh is the funniest</p>
<p>thing hey it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>legal right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious yeah that was hilarious that was funny</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>tried to take my back this was the coolest i did</p>
<p>a mini bar upside down knee bar i&rsquo;m on my head feet up</p>
<p>knee barring him</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m standing</p>
<p>against the ropes and he&rsquo;s trying to get my back</p>
<p>so you just dove</p>
<p>down on a knee bar that&rsquo;s it i go like okay get my back</p>
<p>so right away when he did i dove in</p>
<p>but he grabs the ropes</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m standing upside down at the top of my head</p>
<p>left the knee bar he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s tapping into ropes your rope</p>
<p>escaping wow</p>
<p>yeah that was wild</p>
<p>man you were really there for some</p>
<p>crazy times what is it like now</p>
<p>going from like your your very beginnings</p>
<p>where there was no</p>
<p>mixed martial arts</p>
<p>where you went over there you were</p>
<p>literally had no idea what it was like</p>
<p>to seeing what it&rsquo;s like now</p>
<p>you know with like kane velasquez</p>
<p>and all these guys</p>
<p>unbelievable</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>understand that what i keep from thai boxing right</p>
<p>you get weight glasses</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like boxing</p>
<p>so i came to japan</p>
<p>and the first</p>
<p>thing i see is my opponent</p>
<p>is 245 pounds</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m 195</p>
<p>so i go like okay but i didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to show anything of course because okay this what it is</p>
<p>right you gotta fight</p>
<p>so i go okay cool cool cool cool i said how many</p>
<p>rounds i say one</p>
<p>round i said awesome how many minutes</p>
<p>thirty say awesome</p>
<p>but i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think inside</p>
<p>awesome i go</p>
<p>thirty minutes</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna fight</p>
<p>thirty minutes</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s why i put</p>
<p>those r&rsquo;s on my hand</p>
<p>i have to stay</p>
<p>relaxed because i&rsquo;m such a hot ad</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what the r</p>
<p>stood for yeah</p>
<p>relaxed yeah in holland it</p>
<p>starts with an r also so what&rsquo;s coincidentally is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s for routin</p>
<p>no no no for</p>
<p>rustic stay</p>
<p>comfortable</p>
<p>every time when i get hit</p>
<p>you hear my corner you listen to the</p>
<p>fight you go</p>
<p>stay calm stay calm stay calm because they know i</p>
<p>wanna that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>in holland were</p>
<p>all first round</p>
<p>knockouts i</p>
<p>would come out for a technical pop boom</p>
<p>as long as you get</p>
<p>hit you get</p>
<p>crazy oh i got</p>
<p>crazy so i figured i said man if i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna fight a guy like a rookie machado</p>
<p>you know we can take a lot of punishment</p>
<p>but then come back and i got 28 more minutes to go</p>
<p>whoa we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>shoot load i don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to have that so i put the two r&rsquo;s on my hand and they</p>
<p>would sound</p>
<p>they never shouted</p>
<p>an instruction the only instruction they</p>
<p>shout is like when i&rsquo;m in a guard</p>
<p>i would tell them</p>
<p>right this is my easiest</p>
<p>guard escape on the planet</p>
<p>imagine the</p>
<p>guard is here and his left foot</p>
<p>is on top right</p>
<p>i would look at my corner and it</p>
<p>would go right and i</p>
<p>would swing back and</p>
<p>under hook it</p>
<p>and grab it</p>
<p>they would be the eyes for me</p>
<p>and i till this</p>
<p>day i don&rsquo;t get it that nobody does this</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the simplest</p>
<p>thing on the planet</p>
<p>to know which foot is on top so he&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>lucky push up yeah</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not being held so you</p>
<p>just look at him and they go</p>
<p>right and then you</p>
<p>relax and then</p>
<p>whoop pick it up oh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious do you do that for your guys as well</p>
<p>oh yeah yeah i did it also yeah you</p>
<p>gotta be careful</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get caught in a triangle though no</p>
<p>oh you know you know that</p>
<p>right right yeah</p>
<p>this is not like</p>
<p>while he&rsquo;s pulling on your arm</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s try it now</p>
<p>man how old diamond plays how</p>
<p>crazy is it</p>
<p>watching the</p>
<p>evolution of the game</p>
<p>i mean literally in america there has</p>
<p>never been a</p>
<p>sport like mixed martial arts that has</p>
<p>exploded and</p>
<p>changed and grown</p>
<p>right before our eyes</p>
<p>i mean some sports got</p>
<p>famous like</p>
<p>skateboarding and</p>
<p>bmx riding i mean some</p>
<p>stuff that wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>a viable way</p>
<p>to make a living when i was a kid became one</p>
<p>but nothing like</p>
<p>mixed martial arts</p>
<p>where it was just constantly in the public eye in</p>
<p>movies and jammed down your throat on</p>
<p>television i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty fucking strange isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s i predicted it</p>
<p>right away after my</p>
<p>first fight they did an interview</p>
<p>with me and i said this is like a rollerball that movie</p>
<p>this people</p>
<p>gonna need like an outlet</p>
<p>you know and this is it this is</p>
<p>gonna be very big i say you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching four years from now or no</p>
<p>yeah i said</p>
<p>it four years from now this will be the biggest</p>
<p>thing and it was like</p>
<p>seven years</p>
<p>later or something i was like way off in time</p>
<p>but eventually it got there i go like what is</p>
<p>what is better than this</p>
<p>i knew at that time already that everybody likes to be</p>
<p>to know who&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>toughest guy on the planet and this is</p>
<p>literally being the</p>
<p>toughest guy</p>
<p>i was an inside</p>
<p>mma last week</p>
<p>and i was ashamed</p>
<p>about a comment that i made</p>
<p>against frank</p>
<p>because we had a comment</p>
<p>that one guy says oh</p>
<p>mma is just like two guys</p>
<p>rubbing against each</p>
<p>other on the floor</p>
<p>and then i told them the</p>
<p>story that i was fighting</p>
<p>frank and then</p>
<p>i stood up and i said to frank</p>
<p>come up he says no no you come down i said no come up</p>
<p>fight like a man</p>
<p>you know and i go</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m eating those words</p>
<p>right now because when i</p>
<p>broke that guy shin bone</p>
<p>because i had no clue how much power that</p>
<p>was on that joint</p>
<p>you know that really</p>
<p>started making me</p>
<p>think and i go</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>understood it</p>
<p>the ground guy can</p>
<p>break whatever he wants in your body</p>
<p>you got so much dominant</p>
<p>power if i roll with guys</p>
<p>my students</p>
<p>they brought a</p>
<p>stand with me then the ground</p>
<p>because of the ground they say you always you there</p>
<p>standing they can move around you know</p>
<p>right and they get hell out of there he</p>
<p>says but it&rsquo;s way harder on the ground</p>
<p>so i go like wow listen</p>
<p>i can dislocate</p>
<p>break snap i can do whatever i want if i say okay your</p>
<p>right arm is</p>
<p>gonna go your</p>
<p>right arm is</p>
<p>gonna go to any</p>
<p>guy on the street</p>
<p>you know i mean talking</p>
<p>about power compared to</p>
<p>knocking somebody out</p>
<p>i can put you to</p>
<p>sleep i can do some</p>
<p>crazy things with you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>strange thing</p>
<p>the jiu jitsu that</p>
<p>just came out</p>
<p>of nowhere i mean when i was a kid it was all</p>
<p>about striking there was</p>
<p>no one ever took judo</p>
<p>i wrestled in high</p>
<p>school but you know i just did it as a</p>
<p>sport you know</p>
<p>and i got bored with it</p>
<p>quick because it just didn&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s anything</p>
<p>going on you know</p>
<p>the guy down but it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>submitting submitting them</p>
<p>and once jiu jitsu came</p>
<p>along man it&rsquo;s amazing how much it&rsquo;s evolved</p>
<p>you look at like mma</p>
<p>look at the</p>
<p>jiu jitsu that was in</p>
<p>mma in 93 and look at the</p>
<p>jiu jitsu see now with like chakra ray</p>
<p>damian maya</p>
<p>you know fucking</p>
<p>so many levels</p>
<p>above it the</p>
<p>thing is what i</p>
<p>always say i say all the moves are pretty much invented</p>
<p>right but it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>setups they</p>
<p>found such creative ways to go to a</p>
<p>particular move that is the cool part</p>
<p>about mixed martial arts style</p>
<p>if you have that set up that nobody noticed yet</p>
<p>you see how many times you remember the</p>
<p>first time the anaconda got</p>
<p>introduced in pride</p>
<p>the guy from the garris camp</p>
<p>they said we call this anaconda</p>
<p>that was no garrett told me yeah because nobody saw the</p>
<p>freaking thing before boom everybody</p>
<p>start landing anaconda</p>
<p>yeah you know darse</p>
<p>joke same thing boom</p>
<p>suddenly there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the dars you know oh you can do it on the other</p>
<p>instead the armpit you go to the</p>
<p>you see so people stop playing with it and they create</p>
<p>these different ways like deed</p>
<p>lister against the</p>
<p>suck what is the ala</p>
<p>the italian guy suck</p>
<p>alessio sakari</p>
<p>the way he said the triangle choke up</p>
<p>i mean wow that was so cool it was so</p>
<p>sneaky slowly but surely that bloop</p>
<p>you know you go like</p>
<p>that is cool lister&rsquo;s a master it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unbelievable right</p>
<p>yeah i mean lister if</p>
<p>dean lister was around the</p>
<p>early ufcs nobody had jujutsu like him</p>
<p>93 you know even hoist</p>
<p>crazy didn&rsquo;t his jujutsu was very</p>
<p>basic it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>nothing like you know the jujutsu that you see</p>
<p>today you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a few guys that they say when they</p>
<p>compare jiu</p>
<p>jitsu they stay</p>
<p>you know like hixon is a perfect example</p>
<p>people today even high level</p>
<p>black belts that</p>
<p>roll with him just say that guy is on another level</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just a few guys that are just</p>
<p>you know leborio</p>
<p>ricardo leborio&rsquo;s another one they say</p>
<p>about that he&rsquo;s just on another level</p>
<p>just to such a high</p>
<p>level of jiu jitsu</p>
<p>but overall</p>
<p>the level of</p>
<p>jiu jitsu from the new guys like the</p>
<p>marcelo garcias</p>
<p>you know these new guys coming along</p>
<p>fucking sis</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so high</p>
<p>level it&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>more advanced than it was just 10 15 years ago you know</p>
<p>you know what a cool</p>
<p>thing is with liborio</p>
<p>he saw me rolling with jo ki manson</p>
<p>in china news</p>
<p>watching there and then he&rsquo;s for</p>
<p>show started showing me</p>
<p>things and i said what he</p>
<p>could do with</p>
<p>those particular lag locks and how we</p>
<p>could do this and</p>
<p>make it there</p>
<p>stronger and</p>
<p>and he was sitting look at me and he was like</p>
<p>oh i said oh you thought i was a</p>
<p>striker right and he go i didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s finished that</p>
<p>he wanted me</p>
<p>to come to an american top team to</p>
<p>teach a ground</p>
<p>fighting semi</p>
<p>that is cool stuff</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s good to have a</p>
<p>fresh perspective you know i mean you</p>
<p>never know that everybody has</p>
<p>their own way of doing</p>
<p>things that you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen it before</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it you</p>
<p>know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so many different techniques what people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand that don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>jiu jitsu there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so many different techniques that are</p>
<p>available it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like chess if you had a million</p>
<p>pieces you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so many different</p>
<p>submissions and so many different</p>
<p>transitions and</p>
<p>chains of submissions and new techniques and new</p>
<p>counters and yeah but i believe in</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good to know them all but</p>
<p>for every fight you have to say okay i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to use this</p>
<p>particular move for that guy</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t go crazy on this</p>
<p>deal because you know</p>
<p>and then have</p>
<p>those different</p>
<p>setups that is the key man i</p>
<p>would set up one to four</p>
<p>and go from one to four to</p>
<p>two to back to one to boom cart</p>
<p>some guys like jake</p>
<p>shields jake</p>
<p>shields is very basic</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t do a lot of different techniques rear naked</p>
<p>choke arm bar</p>
<p>guillotine choke</p>
<p>but he just fucking gets them yeah</p>
<p>i mean notion</p>
<p>yeah his path to</p>
<p>those techniques is so sharp yep</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>think so what do you</p>
<p>think about guys</p>
<p>today like when you look at</p>
<p>these guys today and you know</p>
<p>do you ever wish like man i was</p>
<p>did you ever say like</p>
<p>i came along too late like what do i want why yeah</p>
<p>on one side yeah but you know i always go with the</p>
<p>glasses have fool with me</p>
<p>you know i i&rsquo;m in a</p>
<p>great position</p>
<p>right now man i mean i got a</p>
<p>movie coming up with a big part for this you know the</p>
<p>kevin james comedy</p>
<p>you know i got</p>
<p>the tv show my wife predicted that one also by the way</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the inside</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that ever</p>
<p>made i mean</p>
<p>this is like</p>
<p>this is our fourth year</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crazy it&rsquo;s nice</p>
<p>and my wife when she she predicted that i was</p>
<p>gonna be a fighter in</p>
<p>japan and i said no because i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna fight she says she had holland you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go to</p>
<p>japan watch</p>
<p>six months later i&rsquo;m in japan</p>
<p>and two years into that</p>
<p>she looks at me weird</p>
<p>again i said now what</p>
<p>she says we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go to america you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be in tv business</p>
<p>swear to god how did you ever get that</p>
<p>a part of the</p>
<p>grand theft auto</p>
<p>like the men&rsquo;s room was probably one of the funniest</p>
<p>things ever</p>
<p>are you gonna ever do another one</p>
<p>what is it i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen it oh go on youtube he has a show</p>
<p>yeah he has</p>
<p>inside the grand theft auto</p>
<p>i would just sit there to</p>
<p>watch his show</p>
<p>inside the video games</p>
<p>oh yeah yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>buzzword in gta 4</p>
<p>that was they say</p>
<p>these guys from bar</p>
<p>fighting they saw it</p>
<p>and what they did they gave me a</p>
<p>script i said can i</p>
<p>tweet this thing and they say sure</p>
<p>so i would start</p>
<p>building sentences in the middle of the sentence i</p>
<p>would stop and then restart it so it looks like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a total</p>
<p>freaking psycho when i&rsquo;m talking it&rsquo;s like really</p>
<p>weird because it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work and</p>
<p>and the the result when you see the result is one of my</p>
<p>final work man</p>
<p>i had to send</p>
<p>people out there i say you can because they were</p>
<p>cracking up so hard</p>
<p>all the guys who fought though you&rsquo;re the very best in</p>
<p>my opinion at</p>
<p>transitioning into a career outside of</p>
<p>fighting and you do inside mma</p>
<p>you do commentary</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always do so by the way</p>
<p>you and michael shievello</p>
<p>when you did the commentary for</p>
<p>strike force for the</p>
<p>undercard was</p>
<p>the fucking best part of the night</p>
<p>i loved it i</p>
<p>loved it you guys need to do it together i love</p>
<p>shievello i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s fucking hilarious</p>
<p>you guys together were awesome somebody really needs to</p>
<p>scoop you up and have you guys do</p>
<p>more commentary</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>i love doing it but this</p>
<p>right now you know this is one of</p>
<p>those things that i thought i would</p>
<p>never say but i&rsquo;m so busy</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have the time for it anymore</p>
<p>but anytime i have a chance like for instance</p>
<p>now i&rsquo;d go to brussels</p>
<p>you know and then i do this just like</p>
<p>three days before i have to go to boston to shoot</p>
<p>she said why</p>
<p>do you do it you don&rsquo;t need to do it i say yeah but i</p>
<p>enjoy it i enjoy it so much to go there</p>
<p>and there i&rsquo;m also the ring announcer</p>
<p>and they let me free i get slapped</p>
<p>girls i do fun</p>
<p>stuff you know what</p>
<p>is brussels</p>

<p>they had one before</p>
<p>right yeah also one inside</p>
<p>mma which yes</p>
<p>yeah inside</p>
<p>mma by the way if you don&rsquo;t have hd</p>
<p>net you&rsquo;re missing out hd net is</p>
<p>the best for</p>
<p>watching fights</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>k1 k1 max they have</p>
<p>100 different</p>
<p>mfcs on 100 different</p>
<p>mixed martial arts organizations</p>
<p>fights from japan</p>
<p>fights from europe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really incredible</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where inside</p>
<p>mma your show is on as well</p>
<p>i love it and the</p>
<p>thing i love</p>
<p>about it is i see my old buddies</p>
<p>again whether they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still fighting or they&rsquo;re now</p>
<p>coaches from guys</p>
<p>and then i see the new</p>
<p>talent coming up</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>we all have them on the show you know we</p>
<p>would have thought you</p>
<p>could get a bossy award</p>
<p>you know like you can win a bossy</p>
<p>if you have the</p>
<p>greatest knockout of the year or something</p>
<p>how cool is that you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>we really want to</p>
<p>start doing that</p>
<p>thing i think in the</p>
<p>front of a live audience that</p>
<p>would be cool to do also</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really getting there we</p>
<p>never thought it was</p>
<p>gonna go like that</p>
<p>you know when it just</p>
<p>exploded from the half hour show we went</p>
<p>right away to an hour</p>
<p>and now commercials</p>
<p>are there so that means we&rsquo;re doing a good</p>
<p>thing with the hottest show on adj</p>
<p>net yeah maison</p>
<p>mma is great</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really really fun show to</p>
<p>watch now what</p>
<p>about guys that you know that you</p>
<p>started out with that have</p>
<p>taken a lot of damage</p>
<p>you know i mean you</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t take damage you took damage to your body like</p>
<p>you have tendinitis but you have no problem with your</p>
<p>thinking no</p>
<p>but what is it like when you see guys</p>
<p>that do because it disturbs the shit out of me really</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really sad the way i know a few guys that</p>
<p>start lisping and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>scary stuff</p>
<p>you know the like alosky</p>
<p>fight though</p>
<p>you know andre</p>
<p>you know i love this guy he&rsquo;s a really nice guy</p>
<p>i know he wants to</p>
<p>fight he already wants to</p>
<p>prepare for the next</p>
<p>fight i think somebody</p>
<p>should say you know what</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not do it</p>
<p>what do you think</p>
<p>about greg jackson saying that he&rsquo;s gonna get</p>
<p>right back in there they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna fix it and he</p>
<p>did some things</p>
<p>wrong but he&rsquo;s not done and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna come back it&rsquo;ll be even</p>
<p>sweeter than ever</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m listening i&rsquo;m talking i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>motherfucker do you know that this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been knocked</p>
<p>unconscious</p>
<p>four times in a row</p>
<p>you can you can kill</p>
<p>everything for the rest yeah</p>
<p>you know i mean maybe</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not gonna be a</p>
<p>teacher anymore nothing but makes martial</p>
<p>art that&rsquo;s the bad</p>
<p>thing also is</p>
<p>like your legacy is</p>
<p>going down what are you</p>
<p>gonna be a coach</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna go to a gym to</p>
<p>train with a guy who lost his last</p>
<p>seven fights imagine you&rsquo;re a guy like that</p>
<p>before do i</p>
<p>knock out no</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not there was not alosky i&rsquo;m doing but i lost</p>
<p>you right now yeah</p>
<p>you know they</p>
<p>should what i said what i should do</p>
<p>should tell them</p>
<p>okay you know what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna</p>
<p>fight for a year</p>
<p>and in between we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do some</p>
<p>grappling tournaments to keep the competition on there</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re busy and it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter if you win</p>
<p>or lose who cares about it</p>
<p>just be busy with competition so you</p>
<p>you perform</p>
<p>under pressure</p>
<p>and then if</p>
<p>everything feels good you know</p>
<p>then maybe try</p>
<p>it one more time but then really say okay if this is</p>
<p>gonna go the</p>
<p>wrong way you really</p>
<p>gotta stop like it took</p>
<p>about a year off from the</p>
<p>rogers fight didn&rsquo;t he</p>
<p>yeah but in my book</p>
<p>if i was my student</p>
<p>it was no i</p>
<p>would say no this has</p>
<p>been shut off too many times yeah</p>
<p>because i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to be that nail in the coffin that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna say god knows what happens what</p>
<p>about a guy like alstar that got stopped up</p>
<p>bunch of times i mean alistar got stopped like</p>
<p>think nine times in his career</p>
<p>bobby hoffman</p>
<p>knocked them out chocolate</p>
<p>del knocked them out so many guys stopped him and</p>
<p>look at them now</p>
<p>i mean i know the</p>
<p>greatest comeback ever</p>
<p>i know but you you</p>
<p>you see this fighting</p>
<p>style how he fights</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t throw</p>
<p>i was i was looking at so</p>
<p>let it go make</p>
<p>three four shots pa</p>
<p>pa pa paddy</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>everything is single shots</p>
<p>his defense is perfect boom</p>
<p>boom boom every watch</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>three right</p>
<p>uppercut left took</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s very good and</p>
<p>he knows you know yeah of course</p>
<p>tries not to get hit</p>
<p>tries not to get hit and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be hard for people to hit him</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so much power</p>
<p>you know i mean look at look</p>
<p>the striking is</p>
<p>bizarre the guy is so</p>
<p>strong his take</p>
<p>down his fence is getting really good he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great submissions ground control is really good</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s ever</p>
<p>been like alistair</p>
<p>that won the k1</p>
<p>grand prix and is a</p>
<p>mixed martial arts</p>
<p>champion yep</p>
<p>dream and strike</p>
<p>force three belts pretty fucking crazy yeah</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s really cool stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a guy you know</p>
<p>this is cool he</p>
<p>trained in the</p>
<p>early days he</p>
<p>trained chris dolman</p>
<p>when i was training there</p>
<p>he had his brother valentine</p>
<p>and i would</p>
<p>submit them</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>would they&rsquo;re very competitive</p>
<p>and then if i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t come over there</p>
<p>they suddenly</p>
<p>would call and they say oh we&rsquo;re at your gym</p>
<p>we want to train now because now we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get you</p>
<p>i say okay and then</p>
<p>it went again</p>
<p>and they say how is that possible i said because i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>training too</p>
<p>well but i always said that&rsquo;s the guy</p>
<p>those are the guys because</p>
<p>they keep on coming keep on coming i want more and</p>
<p>travel for it</p>
<p>he wants it and the guy who really wants it</p>
<p>it really is</p>
<p>like that it&rsquo;s like the book i always say the alchemist</p>
<p>you know if you set your goal you say that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where i want to go</p>
<p>whatever you do you don&rsquo;t get off the path you know</p>
<p>you are gonna get it i</p>
<p>truly believe</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something up there that helps you for that nope</p>
<p>go go relentless</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t walk over people though</p>
<p>in order to get there</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re andro</p>
<p>lovski and you&rsquo;ve been knocking</p>
<p>out four times in a row</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>but physically you have to stop and look at it and go</p>
<p>all right what are we</p>
<p>gonna do here</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how you say this i think</p>
<p>that you how do you tell when to tell them</p>
<p>i think that</p>
<p>people inside deep down inside the fathers know</p>
<p>if they can become a</p>
<p>champion or not i</p>
<p>think they already know that</p>
<p>when i was fighting and i</p>
<p>started winning in</p>
<p>japan when i</p>
<p>got the ground game i look at my wife i say</p>
<p>i think i can be a real</p>
<p>champion this</p>
<p>thing i truly believe i</p>
<p>can beat all</p>
<p>these guys now</p>
<p>you know and then it</p>
<p>started you know i</p>
<p>think you feel that i</p>
<p>think that that a</p>
<p>fighter will actually knows himself</p>
<p>they will keep on trying and keep on trying but i</p>
<p>think once you</p>
<p>know that it&rsquo;s not really there that that&rsquo;s not a good</p>
<p>feeling they</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t say it but it is it&rsquo;s like the guys who you mount</p>
<p>you hit they turn on the back and they get choked</p>
<p>mm hmm a lot of</p>
<p>these guys they give the choke</p>
<p>speaking of that what did you think</p>
<p>about the fatal</p>
<p>fight when fatal was fighting</p>
<p>bigfoot i mean he</p>
<p>gave up his back a couple of times he had to it was you</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s just too big</p>
<p>it was too big</p>
<p>i truly believe said</p>
<p>too big with</p>
<p>too big too big</p>
<p>too big and combination yeah</p>
<p>and then and then</p>
<p>being what 60</p>
<p>pounds heavier</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s a big difference man</p>
<p>i always said i wanted weight</p>
<p>class 205 to 35</p>
<p>yeah i agree no i agree</p>
<p>yeah i agree</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the too big of a leap</p>
<p>yeah those big</p>
<p>giant guys that are cutting weight to get down to</p>
<p>265 that&rsquo;s a huge percentage they said that he was 290</p>
<p>today i hope you gained 25</p>
<p>this fucking head looks like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>290 that guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>big yeah it&rsquo;s big</p>
<p>when he got on top of fatal and</p>
<p>mounted him you see how wide his is</p>
<p>he like that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>giant person he got</p>
<p>stopped by a bigfoot</p>
<p>did you see the footprint</p>
<p>still on his back</p>
<p>port fader man</p>
<p>that was a tough thing to watch and it&rsquo;s tough for even</p>
<p>still to watch all those people</p>
<p>that are behind himself</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna fight again he should fight no no no</p>
<p>the people booing when they don&rsquo;t let the</p>
<p>fight continue i say oh</p>
<p>yeah his eyes is closed</p>
<p>he can&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>anything coming from the left you know at all</p>
<p>yeah anyway</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be the same</p>
<p>thing anyway he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get taken down and smashed</p>
<p>that was it</p>
<p>is it hard watching a guy like that</p>
<p>you mean you</p>
<p>watch them enter into very hard</p>
<p>pride and then</p>
<p>see him get beat down like very hard yeah that</p>
<p>that does something</p>
<p>to you you know that you get emotional</p>
<p>i do get abortion from that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>crazy thing</p>
<p>right but in this game and that the game of</p>
<p>fighting we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna see it no matter what</p>
<p>i mean i was there for</p>
<p>chuck liddell&rsquo;s debut</p>
<p>i was there</p>
<p>you know for</p>
<p>hector gonzalez</p>
<p>i think it was the</p>
<p>guy&rsquo;s name he fought i forget the guy&rsquo;s name he fought</p>
<p>i was there for that knowing</p>
<p>gonzalez maybe</p>
<p>i was there for that</p>
<p>fight and then</p>
<p>to get to see him</p>
<p>you know all the way to the end to the rich franklin</p>
<p>fight you know it&rsquo;s like wow</p>
<p>you know seeing guys like at the top at</p>
<p>their most vibrant</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re just dominant</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>with chuck it&rsquo;s a mental</p>
<p>thing but i always say with</p>
<p>chuck if he has the</p>
<p>right person who</p>
<p>who can talk to him that he&rsquo;s too hungry</p>
<p>like if he lance if he</p>
<p>smells the victory he</p>
<p>starts over committing</p>
<p>and all the</p>
<p>knockouts he had is because of that</p>
<p>if he would step back relax</p>
<p>i mean he was doing really good</p>
<p>against french</p>
<p>franklin this guy</p>
<p>still can be the top guy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s his only defect</p>
<p>with him it&rsquo;s not that he lost his</p>
<p>timing and lost that it&rsquo;s only that he&rsquo;s too hungry</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>knocking on people too easy</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the same you can also see with the</p>
<p>training when he fought couture</p>
<p>you know that when he</p>
<p>trains he puts everybody backwards</p>
<p>and then sunday when couture</p>
<p>came and started pushing him backwards</p>
<p>that was like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa</p>
<p>now what he</p>
<p>never was there</p>
<p>that fight made him</p>
<p>again way better</p>
<p>after that made</p>
<p>him a better</p>
<p>counter strike</p>
<p>oh man yeah he</p>
<p>learned how to fire him off as he was moving backwards</p>
<p>one of my favorite guys</p>
<p>still is amazing yeah</p>
<p>he also lost the ability to take a</p>
<p>punch i mean if you go back and</p>
<p>watch his first</p>
<p>fights like with you ever</p>
<p>watched the pele</p>
<p>fight with no</p>
<p>oh my gosh yeah that was crazy</p>
<p>wvc right yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah that was</p>
<p>bare knuckle</p>
<p>bare knuckles</p>
<p>guys with the</p>
<p>net underneath the ropes so you</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t escape</p>
<p>stuck in there</p>
<p>chucks on top of pale</p>
<p>and punched him in the face with bare</p>
<p>knuckles people get</p>
<p>stabbed in the eyes</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure all</p>
<p>the time dudes</p>
<p>would grab the balls</p>
<p>remember i was</p>
<p>gonna say it</p>
<p>but the pedro</p>
<p>he was in his</p>
<p>pants and crushed his dick and balls</p>
<p>he said i had viagra on them he</p>
<p>literally grabbed the guy by the kohonis yeah</p>
<p>what the fuck and it was totally</p>
<p>completely legal yeah</p>
<p>and nobody had ever done it but gary</p>
<p>and valletuto anything else</p>
<p>yeah that is</p>
<p>anything up were they allowed to bite though</p>
<p>i thought you know well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>i read the book from</p>
<p>big john because i wrote the</p>
<p>foreword for the book</p>
<p>and man that&rsquo;s a cool book</p>
<p>what is big</p>
<p>john&rsquo;s book</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s wrong but</p>
<p>where do you</p>
<p>think john mccarthy yeah</p>
<p>no no no what is this line</p>
<p>oh let&rsquo;s get it</p>
<p>on let&rsquo;s get it on but that&rsquo;s sort of mills lane&rsquo;s line</p>
<p>mills lane in boxing had that way before the us oh yeah</p>
<p>yeah well i don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>fire are you</p>
<p>ready fire are you</p>
<p>ready let&rsquo;s get it out come on okay</p>
<p>that was his thing</p>
<p>and they like had made some sort of an</p>
<p>agreement where</p>
<p>john was gonna use it in</p>
<p>mma and mills lane was</p>
<p>gonna use it in boxing</p>
<p>okay but i remember</p>
<p>when you know there was like some words</p>
<p>that people were saying oh you know only john mccarthy</p>
<p>could say let&rsquo;s get it on because every</p>
<p>referees got to figure out a</p>
<p>thing to say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s martin gay</p>
<p>is the one that started it</p>
<p>marvin gaye marvin gaye</p>
<p>yeah well i mean you know let&rsquo;s get it on</p>
<p>the mills landing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve seen it all boss</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>there from the beginning you know you&rsquo;re a real</p>
<p>legend in this</p>
<p>crazy sport</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a very happy person let me</p>
<p>tell you that i have a lot of pain when i walk you know</p>
<p>everything hurts but it&rsquo;s been worth it</p>
<p>and i know that with the stem cells and</p>
<p>everything a book something will pop up</p>
<p>you know and i&rsquo;ll put it back i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna fight anymore you know i&rsquo;m also</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s also a</p>
<p>thing that i had when in 2006 when i made the comeback</p>
<p>i knew that</p>
<p>like i would roll</p>
<p>and everything</p>
<p>would go really well don&rsquo;t get me</p>
<p>wrong but there were</p>
<p>things that i say</p>
<p>i would have had that normally</p>
<p>and normally i</p>
<p>would have had that i noticed</p>
<p>that i was getting slower</p>
<p>you know and that my reactions were not</p>
<p>there as they were before</p>
<p>so you know you got to be</p>
<p>you know be very realistic to yourself</p>
<p>what do you think</p>
<p>about a guy like</p>
<p>randy couture who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>older than you</p>
<p>i mean how old do you know yeah but 45</p>
<p>46 randy&rsquo;s fucking 40 years old</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s about to</p>
<p>fight machida</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crazy but</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got the o2 trainer</p>
<p>the boss was</p>
<p>an invention the long</p>
<p>training device</p>
<p>what is the o2 trainer</p>
<p>you know what this is a fun</p>
<p>thing man i came up</p>
<p>with this yeah</p>
<p>when i was 15</p>
<p>years old around that time i had very bad asthma</p>
<p>but i also did</p>
<p>track and field</p>
<p>so when i had an asthma attack that</p>
<p>would be like a two week episode</p>
<p>which from the two weeks i</p>
<p>would be like five or six days in bed</p>
<p>because i couldn&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>and can breathe</p>
<p>because she can&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>she know you can</p>
<p>drink it like this</p>
<p>twenty four</p>
<p>hours day like</p>
<p>oh yeah now really bad</p>
<p>so i can walk</p>
<p>stairs nothing</p>
<p>everything in bed</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have any of that anymore no no sometimes i</p>
<p>do sometimes a little bit yeah</p>
<p>but you take an inhaler and it&rsquo;s gone</p>
<p>but then after i had an attack and i would do</p>
<p>track and field</p>
<p>i would realize that my</p>
<p>lungs would</p>
<p>work better</p>
<p>and i go why is that and i</p>
<p>start oh wait a</p>
<p>minute there&rsquo;s an infection in your lung pipe</p>
<p>you know it closes the lung pipe</p>
<p>your lungs have to work really hard to pull that air in</p>
<p>then when the infection is gone you know</p>
<p>they because</p>
<p>they work all the time they&rsquo;re used to pulling hard</p>
<p>air comes in easy</p>
<p>i go so why don&rsquo;t i come up with something that</p>
<p>controls the air intake</p>
<p>so i started</p>
<p>thinking about like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the stupidest</p>
<p>thing man you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna laugh like i will hold my mouth</p>
<p>in a certain position and try to memorize that position</p>
<p>stupid stuff</p>
<p>so you get much air in yeah</p>
<p>like and then make it</p>
<p>every time a little</p>
<p>smaller i go man i</p>
<p>gotta come up with something</p>
<p>so i tell all these</p>
<p>my buddies here in america everybody knew and hold</p>
<p>also that i wanted to make that thing</p>
<p>and then when vandale</p>
<p>came on tv with the snorkel</p>
<p>i think i had six or seven</p>
<p>phone calls</p>
<p>they said you</p>
<p>gotta do that</p>
<p>thing that you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about because somebody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna find it out somebody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna come up</p>
<p>with an idea</p>
<p>you know so i</p>
<p>started looking at a patent lawyer</p>
<p>and what do you know man nobody made it</p>
<p>i got the patent have</p>
<p>everything the what&rsquo;s it called</p>
<p>the boss root and</p>
<p>go to trainer the o two trainer</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i was</p>
<p>laughing because when i saw this</p>
<p>yeah o two trainer and it&rsquo;s it controls the air intake</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>simple thing</p>
<p>so imagine this week you do all your hard workouts like</p>
<p>only four times also because you don&rsquo;t need to do it</p>
<p>every way because she&rsquo;s actually turning your muscles</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re testing it in</p>
<p>texas right now at the university</p>
<p>that guy in 12 days he had</p>
<p>greater long volume</p>
<p>he said man you made something really cool</p>
<p>can i put my</p>
<p>track team on it he&rsquo;s got his female</p>
<p>track team on it they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna run test on them now because he thinks also</p>
<p>that because it&rsquo;s a little small</p>
<p>biodegradable little</p>
<p>compartment that&rsquo;s flexible also so you can&rsquo;t get hurt</p>
<p>because you rebreathe</p>
<p>the little tiny bit of carbon monoxide</p>
<p>which i want</p>
<p>to stay away from because i don&rsquo;t want people to get</p>
<p>dizzy he says no no you don&rsquo;t get this carbon dioxide</p>
<p>carbon dioxide</p>
<p>i wanted it too</p>
<p>anyway he says he</p>
<p>thinks it&rsquo;s just enough to spark</p>
<p>more red blood cell</p>
<p>production i</p>
<p>think you kidding</p>
<p>me he said i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know for sure yet he says but i will be the</p>
<p>icing on the cake wow</p>
<p>what is this</p>
<p>thing look like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an you know</p>
<p>she i hope i</p>
<p>still get better is it online can i find it online</p>
<p>let me see you go to o2trainer com</p>

<p>come back at the end of the week</p>
<p>so it will be something that you</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>make a big impact on i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s gonna be the</p>
<p>major impact is because</p>
<p>you look at it describe what it looks like okay it is</p>
<p>it is a supportable device it&rsquo;s a mouthpiece</p>
<p>like when you dive you know</p>
<p>like the snorkel</p>
<p>and it comes to the</p>
<p>front with two little</p>
<p>things it&rsquo;s like a square</p>
<p>and it comes to the</p>
<p>front here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>hole in as a cap</p>
<p>the cap you</p>
<p>can take off</p>
<p>and you can put</p>
<p>screens in there little rubber</p>
<p>screens with all</p>
<p>smaller holes they go from fourteen</p>
<p>millimeter all the way to one millimeter</p>
<p>so this week you</p>
<p>train all your hard work that&rsquo;s fourteen</p>
<p>millimeter next week you do thirteen</p>
<p>then you do</p>
<p>twelve and you go slowly gradually</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going down</p>
<p>and i want you down you know you you you really</p>
<p>you have to pull the air in</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the the</p>
<p>voice my wife</p>
<p>was saying like after</p>
<p>three weeks of</p>
<p>training in restaurant</p>
<p>she said man keep your</p>
<p>voice on you know</p>
