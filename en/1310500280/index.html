    <p>remember George Washington? You know how he died? Well meaning physicians bled him to death,</p>
<p>and this was the most important patient in the country, maybe in the history of the country,</p>
<p>and we bled him to death trying to help him. So when you&rsquo;re actually inflating the money supply</p>
<p>at 7% but you&rsquo;re calling it 2% because you want to help the economy, you&rsquo;re literally bleeding</p>
<p>the free market to death. But the sad fact is George Washington went along with it because he</p>
<p>thought that they were going to do him good, and the majority of the society, most companies,</p>
<p>most conventional thinkers, you know, the working class, they go along with this because they think</p>
<p>that someone has their best interest of mind, and the people that are bleeding them to death</p>
<p>believe, they believe that prescription because their mental models are just so defective.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Michael Saylor, one of the most prominent and brilliant</p>
<p>Bitcoin proponents in the world. He is the CEO of MicroStrategy, founder of Saylor Academy,</p>
<p>graduate of MIT, and Michael is one of the most fascinating and rigorous thinkers I&rsquo;ve ever gotten</p>
<p>a chance to explore ideas with. He can effortlessly zoom out to the big perspectives of human</p>
<p>civilization and human history, and zoom back in to the technical details of blockchains, markets,</p>
<p>governments, and financial systems. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Michael Saylor.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Michael Saylor. Let&rsquo;s start with a big question of truth and wisdom. When advanced humans</p>
<p>or aliens or AI systems, let&rsquo;s say five to ten centuries from now, look back at Earth</p>
<p>on this early 21st century, how much do you think they would say we understood about</p>
<p>money and economics, or even about engineering, science, life, death, meaning, intelligence,</p>
<p>consciousness, all the big interesting questions?</p>
<p>I think they would probably give us a</p>
<p>B minus on engineering, on all the engineering things, the hard sciences.</p>
<p>A passing grade.</p>
<p>Like, we&rsquo;re doing okay. We&rsquo;re working our way through rockets and jets and electric cars and</p>
<p>an electricity transport systems and nuclear power and space flight and the like. And if you look at</p>
<p>the walls that grace the great court at MIT, it&rsquo;s full of all the great thinkers and they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>pretty admirable. If you could be with Newton or Gauss or Madame Curie or Einstein, you would</p>
<p>respect them. I would say they&rsquo;d give us like a D minus on economics, like an F plus or a D minus.</p>
<p>You have an optimistic vision. First of all, optimistic vision of engineering,</p>
<p>because everybody you&rsquo;ve listed, not everybody, but most people you&rsquo;ve listed is just over the</p>
<p>past couple of centuries. And maybe it stretches a little farther back, but mostly all the cool</p>
<p>stuff we&rsquo;ve done in engineering is the past couple of centuries.</p>
<p>I mean, Archimedes had his virtues. I studied the history of science at MIT and I also studied</p>
<p>aerospace engineering. And so I clearly have a bias in favor of science. And if I look at the</p>
<p>past 10,000 years and I consider all of the philosophy and the politics and their impact</p>
<p>on the human condition, I think it&rsquo;s a wash for every politician that came up with a good idea,</p>
<p>another politician came up with a bad idea. And it&rsquo;s not clear to me that most of the</p>
<p>political and philosophical contributions to the human race and the human conditions</p>
<p>have advanced so much. I mean, we&rsquo;re still taking guidance and admiring Aristotle and</p>
<p>Plato and Seneca and the like. And on the other hand, if you think about what has made the human</p>
<p>condition better, fire, water, harnessing of wind energy, try to row across an ocean, right?</p>
<p>Not easy.</p>
<p>And for people who are just listening or watching, there&rsquo;s a beautiful sexy ship from</p>
<p>16th, 17th century.</p>
<p>This is a 19th century handmade model of a 17th century sailing ship, which is of the type that</p>
<p>the Dutch East India&rsquo;s company used to sail the world and trade. So that was made, the original</p>
<p>was made sometime in the 1600s. And then this model is made in the 19th century by individuals.</p>
<p>So both the model and the ship itself is engineering at its best. And just imagine,</p>
<p>just like rockets flying out to space, how much hope this filled people with,</p>
<p>exploring the unknown, going into the mystery, both the entrepreneurs and the business people</p>
<p>and the engineers and just humans. What&rsquo;s out there? What&rsquo;s out there to be discovered?</p>
<p>Yeah, the metaphor of human beings leaving shore or sailing across the horizon,</p>
<p>risking their lives in pursuit of a better life is an incredibly powerful one.</p>
<p>In 1900, I suppose the average life expectancy is 50. During the Revolutionary War,</p>
<p>while our founding fathers were fighting to establish life, liberty, pursuit of happiness,</p>
<p>the Constitution, average life expectancy is like 32, somewhere between 32 and 36.</p>
<p>So all the sound and the fury doesn&rsquo;t make you live past 32, but what does, right? Antibiotics.</p>
<p>Conquest of infectious diseases. If we understand the science of infectious disease, sterilizing</p>
<p>a knife and harnessing antibiotics gets you from 50 to 70. And that happened fast, right? That</p>
<p>happens from 1900 to 1950 or something like that. And I think if you look at the human condition,</p>
<p>you ever get on one of those rowing machines where they actually keep track of your watts output when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on that? Yeah. It&rsquo;s like 200 is a lot. Okay, 200 is a lot. So a kilowatt hour is like all</p>
<p>the energy that a human, a trained athlete can deliver in a day. And probably not 1% of the</p>
<p>people in the world could deliver a kilowatt hour in a day. And the commercial value of a kilowatt</p>
<p>hour, the retail value is 11 cents today. And the wholesale value is 2 cents. And so you have to look</p>
<p>at the contribution of politicians and philosophers and economists to the human condition. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like at best a wash one way or the other. And then if you look at the contribution of John D.</p>
<p>Rockefeller when he delivered you a barrel of oil and the energy in oil, liquid energy, or the</p>
<p>contribution of Tesla as we deliver electricity. And what&rsquo;s the impact on the human condition if I</p>
<p>have electric power, if I have chemical power, if I have wind energy, if I can actually set up a</p>
<p>reservoir, create a dam, spend a turbine, and generate energy from a hydraulic source?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s extraordinary, right? And so our ability to cross the ocean, our ability to grow food,</p>
<p>our ability to live, it&rsquo;s technology that gets the human race from a brutal life where life</p>
<p>expectancy is 30 to a world where life expectancy is 80.</p>
<p>You gave a D minus to the economists. So are they too like the politicians a wash</p>
<p>in terms of there&rsquo;s good ideas and bad ideas and that tiny delta between good and bad?</p>
<p>Is how you squeak past the F plus onto the D minus territory?</p>
<p>I think most economic ideas are bad ideas.</p>
<p>Most.</p>
<p>You know, like take us back to MIT and you want to solve a fluid dynamics problem. Like design</p>
<p>the shape of the hull of that ship, or you want to design an airfoil, a wing, or if you want to</p>
<p>design an engine or a nozzle in a rocket ship, you wouldn&rsquo;t do it with simple arithmetic.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t do it with a scaler. There&rsquo;s not a single number, right? It&rsquo;s vector math.</p>
<p>You know, computational fluid dynamics is n dimensional, higher level math,</p>
<p>you know, complicated stuff. So when an economist says the inflation rate is</p>
<p>2%, that&rsquo;s a scaler. And when an economist says it&rsquo;s not a problem to print more money,</p>
<p>because the velocity of the money is very low, monetary velocity is low, that&rsquo;s another scaler.</p>
<p>Okay, so the truth of the matter is inflation is not a scaler. Inflation is an n dimensional vector.</p>
<p>Money velocity is not a scaler.</p>
<p>The saying, what&rsquo;s the velocity of money? Oh, it&rsquo;s slow or it&rsquo;s fast. It ignores the question of</p>
<p>what medium is the money moving through. And the same way that, you know, what&rsquo;s the speed of sound?</p>
<p>Okay, well, what is sound, right? Sound, you know, sound is a compression wave. It&rsquo;s energy</p>
<p>moving through a medium, but the speed is different. So for example, the speed of sound through air is</p>
<p>different than the speed of sound through water. And sound moves faster through water,</p>
<p>it moves faster through a solid, and it moves faster to a stiffer solid. So there isn&rsquo;t one.</p>
<p>What is the fundamental problem with the way economists reduce the world down to a model?</p>
<p>Is it too simple? Or is it just even the first generation?</p>
<p>I think that the fundamental problem is, if you see the world as a scaler, you simply pick</p>
<p>the one number which is, which supports whatever you want to do, and you ignore the universe of</p>
<p>other consequences from your behavior. In general, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve heard of the</p>
<p>Eric Weisen has been talking about this with gauge theory. So different kinds of approaches</p>
<p>from the physics world, from the mathematical world to extend past this scaler view of economics.</p>
<p>So gauge theory is one way that comes from physics. Do you find that a way of exploring economics</p>
<p>interesting? So outside of cryptocurrency, outside of the actual technology,</p>
<p>and so on, just analysis of how economics works. Do you find that interesting?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that if we&rsquo;re going to want to really make any scientific progress in economics,</p>
<p>we have to apply much, much more computationally intensive and richer forms of mathematics.</p>
<p>So simulation, perhaps, or?</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, when I was at MIT, I studied system dynamics at MIT.</p>
<p>You know, when I was at MIT, I studied system dynamics. You know, they taught it at the Sloan</p>
<p>School. It was developed by Jay Forrester, who was an extraordinary computer scientist.</p>
<p>And when we created models of economic behavior, they were all multi dimensional nonlinear models.</p>
<p>So if you want to describe how anything works in the real world, you have to start with the concept</p>
<p>of feedback. If I double the price of something, demand will fall, and attempts to create supply</p>
<p>will increase, and there will be a delay before the capacity increases. There&rsquo;ll be an instant</p>
<p>demand change, and there&rsquo;ll be rippling effects throughout every other segment of the economy,</p>
<p>downstream and upstream of such a thing. So it&rsquo;s kind of common sense. But most economics,</p>
<p>most classical economics, it&rsquo;s always, you know, taught with linear models,</p>
<p>you know, fairly simplistic linear models. And oftentimes, even I&rsquo;m really shocked today</p>
<p>that the entire mainstream dialogue of economics has been captured by scale or arithmetic.</p>
<p>For example, if you read, you know, read any article in New York Times or the Wall Street</p>
<p>Journal, right, they just refer to there&rsquo;s an inflation number or the CPI or the inflation</p>
<p>rate is X. And if you look at all the historic studies of the impact of inflation, generally,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all based upon the idea that inflation equals CPI, and then they try to extrapolate from</p>
<p>that and you just get nowhere with it. So at the very least, we should be considering inflation</p>
<p>and other economics concept as a nonlinear dynamical system. So nonlinearity, and also</p>
<p>just embracing the full complexity of just how the variables interact, maybe through simulation,</p>
<p>maybe some have some interesting models around that.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be refreshing if somebody for once published a table of the change in price of every</p>
<p>product, every service, and every asset in every place over time?</p>
<p>LR You said table, some of that also is the task of visualization, how to extract from</p>
<p>this complex set of numbers, patterns that somehow indicate something fundamental about</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening. So like, summarization of data is still important, perhaps summarization,</p>
<p>not down to a single scale of value. But looking at that whole sea of numbers, you have to find</p>
<p>patterns, like what is inflation in a particular sector? What is maybe change over time, maybe</p>
<p>different geographical regions, you know, things of that nature. I think that&rsquo;s kind of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know even what that task is. You know, that&rsquo;s what you could look at machine learning,</p>
<p>you can look at AI with that perspective, which is like, how do you represent what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>efficiently, as efficiently as possible? That&rsquo;s never going to be a single number, but it might</p>
<p>be a compressed model that captures something, something beautiful, something fundamental</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an opportunity, for sure, right? You know, if we take, for example, during the</p>
<p>pandemic, the response of the political apparatus was to lower interest rates to zero, and to</p>
<p>start buying assets, in essence, printing money. And the defense was, there&rsquo;s no inflation.</p>
<p>But of course, you had one part of the economy where it was locked down, so it was illegal</p>
<p>to buy anything. It was either illegal or it was impractical. So it would be impossible</p>
<p>for demand to manifest, so of course, there is no inflation. On the other hand, there</p>
<p>was instantaneous immediate inflation in another part of the economy. For example, you lower</p>
<p>the interest rates to zero. At one point, we saw the swap rate on a 30 year note go</p>
<p>to 72 basis points. Okay, that means that the value of a long dated bond immediately</p>
<p>inflates. So the bond market had hyperinflation within minutes of these</p>
<p>financial decisions. The asset market had hyperinflation within minutes of these</p>
<p>financial decisions.</p>
<p>So here again, it&rsquo;s about how we insights whether the market will</p>
<p>react to the hyperinflation within minutes of these financial decisions.</p>
<p>asset market had hyperinflation. We had what you call a K shape recovery, what we affectionately</p>
<p>call a K shape recovery. Main Street shut down, Wall Street recovered all within six weeks.</p>
<p>The inflation was in the assets, like in the stocks, in the bonds. If you look today, you see</p>
<p>that a typical house, according to the Case Shiller Index today, is up 19.2% year over year. So if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a first time home buyer, the inflation rate is 19%. The formal CPI announced a 7.9%.</p>
<p>You can pretty much create any inflation rate you want by constructing a market basket,</p>
<p>a weighted basket of products or services or assets that yield you the answer. I think that</p>
<p>the fundamental failing of economists is, first of all, they don&rsquo;t really have a term for asset</p>
<p>inflation. What&rsquo;s an asset? What&rsquo;s asset hyperinflation? You mentioned bond market swap</p>
<p>rate and asset is where the majority of the hyperinflation happen. What&rsquo;s inflation? What&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hyperinflation? What&rsquo;s an asset? What&rsquo;s an asset market? I&rsquo;m going to ask so many dumb questions.</p>
<p>In the conventional economic world, you would treat inflation as the rate of increase in</p>
<p>price of a market basket of consumer products defined by a government agency.</p>
<p>LW. So they have like traditional things that a regular consumer would be buying.</p>
<p>The government selects like toilet paper, food, toaster,</p>
<p>refrigerator, electronics, all that kind of stuff. And it&rsquo;s like a representative</p>
<p>basket of goods that lead to a content existence on this earth for a regular consumer.</p>
<p>CM. They define a synthetic metric, right? I mean, I&rsquo;m going to say you should have a thousand</p>
<p>square foot apartment and you should have a used car and you should eat three hamburgers a week.</p>
<p>Now, 10 years go by and the apartment costs more, I could adjust the market basket by a,</p>
<p>they call them hedonic adjustments. I could decide that it used to be in 1970 you needed</p>
<p>a thousand square feet, but in the year 2020, you only need 700 square feet because we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>miniaturized televisions and we&rsquo;ve got more efficient electric appliances and because</p>
<p>things have collapsed out of the iPhone, you just don&rsquo;t need as much space. So now I, you know,</p>
<p>it may be that the apartment costs 50% more, but after the hedonic adjustment, there is no inflation</p>
<p>because I just downgraded the expectation of what a normal person should have.</p>
<p>TG. So the synthetic nature of the metric allows for manipulation by people in power?</p>
<p>CM. Pretty much. I guess my criticism of economists is rather than embracing inflation</p>
<p>based upon its fundamental idea, which is the rate at which the price of things go up, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been captured by mainstream conventional thinking to immediately equate inflation to the</p>
<p>government issued CPI or government issued PCE or government issued PPI measure, which was never the</p>
<p>rate at which things go up. It&rsquo;s simply the rate at which a synthetic basket of products and</p>
<p>services the government wishes to track go up. Now, the problem with that is that the</p>
<p>problem with that is two big things. One thing is the government gets to create the market basket,</p>
<p>and so they keep changing what&rsquo;s in the basket over time. So I mean, if I said three years ago,</p>
<p>you should go see 10 concerts a year and the concert tickets now cost $200 each. Now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>$2,000 a year to go see concerts. Now I&rsquo;m in charge of calculating inflation. So I redefine,</p>
<p>you know, your entertainment quota for the year to be eight Netflix streaming concerts,</p>
<p>and now they don&rsquo;t cost $2,000. They cost nothing, and there is no inflation,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t get your concerts, right? So the problem starts with continually changing</p>
<p>the definition of the market basket. But in my opinion, that&rsquo;s not the biggest problem.</p>
<p>The more egregious problem is the fundamental idea that assets aren&rsquo;t products or services.</p>
<p>Assets can&rsquo;t be inflated. What&rsquo;s an asset?</p>
<p>A house, a share of Apple stock, a bond, a Bitcoin is an asset, or a Picasso painting.</p>
<p>LW. Not a consumable good. Not an Apple that you can eat.</p>
<p>RL. Right. If I throw away an asset, then I&rsquo;m not on the hook to track the inflation rate for it.</p>
<p>So what happens if I change the policy such that, let&rsquo;s take the classic example,</p>
<p>a million dollar bond at a 5% interest rate gives you $50,000 a year in risk free income.</p>
<p>You might retire on $50,000 a year in a low cost jurisdiction. So the cost of social security</p>
<p>or early retirement is $1 million when the interest rate is 5%. During the crisis of March</p>
<p>of 2020, the interest rate went on a 10 year bond went to 50 basis points. So now the cost</p>
<p>of that bond is $10 million. The cost of social security went from a million dollars to $10 million.</p>
<p>So if you wanted to work your entire life, save money, and then retire risk free and live happily</p>
<p>ever after on a $50,000 salary, live in on a beach in Mexico, wherever you wanted to go,</p>
<p>you had hyperinflation. The cost of your aspiration increased by a factor of 10</p>
<p>over the course of some amount of time. In fact, in that case, that was over the course of about 12</p>
<p>years. As the inflation rate ground down, the asset traded up. But the conventional view is,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s not a problem, because it&rsquo;s good that the bond is highly priced because we own the bond.</p>
<p>Or what&rsquo;s the problem with the inflation rate in housing being 19%? It&rsquo;s an awful problem for a</p>
<p>22 year old that&rsquo;s starting their first job, that&rsquo;s saving money to buy a house. But it would</p>
<p>be characterized as a benefit to society by a conventional economist who would say, well, housing</p>
<p>asset values are higher because of interest rate fluctuation, and now the economy has got more</p>
<p>wealth. And so that&rsquo;s viewed as a benefit. So what&rsquo;s being missed here, like the suffering</p>
<p>of the average person, or the struggle, the suffering, the pain of the average person,</p>
<p>like metrics that captured that within the economic system? Is that when you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about different&hellip; One way to say it is a conventional view of inflation as CPI</p>
<p>understates the human misery that&rsquo;s inflicted upon the working class and on mainstream companies by</p>
<p>the political class. And so it&rsquo;s a massive shift of wealth from the working class to the property</p>
<p>class. It&rsquo;s a massive shift of power from the free market to the centrally governed or the</p>
<p>controlled market. It&rsquo;s a massive shift of power from the people to the government. And maybe one</p>
<p>more illustrative point here, Alexis, is what do you think the inflation rate&rsquo;s been for the past</p>
<p>100 years? Oh, you&rsquo;re talking about the scalar again? If you took a survey of everybody on the</p>
<p>street and you asked them, what do they think inflation was? What is it? You remember when</p>
<p>Jerome Powell said our target&rsquo;s 2%, but we&rsquo;re not there. If you go around the corner, I have posted</p>
<p>the deed to this house sold in 1930. Okay. And the number on that deed is $100,000, 1930. And if you</p>
<p>go on Zillow and you get the Z estimate. Is it higher than that? $30,500,000. So that&rsquo;s 92</p>
<p>years, 1930 or 2022. And in 92 years, we&rsquo;ve had 305x increase in price of the house. Now,</p>
<p>if you actually back calculate, you come to a conclusion that the inflation rate was approximately</p>
<p>6.5% a year every year for 92 years. Okay. And there&rsquo;s nobody, nobody in government,</p>
<p>no conventional economists that would ever admit to an inflation rate of 7% a year in the US dollar</p>
<p>over the last century. Now, if you dig deeper, I mean, one guy that&rsquo;s done a great job working on</p>
<p>this is Seyfettin Amos who wrote the book, The Bitcoin Standard. And he notes that on average,</p>
<p>it looks like the inflation rate and the money supply is about 7% a year all the way up to the</p>
<p>year 2020. If you look at the S&amp;P index, which is a market basket of scarce desirable stocks,</p>
<p>it returned about 10%. If you talk to 10% a year for 100 years, the money supply is expanding at</p>
<p>7% 100 years. If you actually talk to economists or you look at the economy and you ask the question,</p>
<p>how fast does the economy grow in its entirety year over year? Generally about 2% to 3%. Like</p>
<p>the sum total impact of all this technology and human ingenuity might get you a 2.5, 3% improvement</p>
<p>a year. As measured by GDP. Are you okay with that? I&rsquo;m not sure. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d go that far yet,</p>
<p>but I would just say that if you had the human race doing stuff and if you asked the question,</p>
<p>how much more efficiently will we do this stuff next year than this year? Or what&rsquo;s the value of</p>
<p>all of our innovations and inventions and investments in the past 12 months? You&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>hard pressed to say we get 2% better. Typical investor thinks they&rsquo;re 10% better every year.</p>
<p>So if you look at what&rsquo;s going on, really, when you&rsquo;re holding a million dollars of stocks and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting a 10% gain a year, you really get a 7% expansion of the money supply. You&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>a 2% or 3% gain under best circumstances. And another way to say that is if the money supply</p>
<p>stopped expanding at 7% a year, the S&amp;P yield might be 3% and not 10%. It probably should be.</p>
<p>Now, that gets you to start to ask a bunch of other fundamental questions. Like</p>
<p>if I borrow a billion dollars and pay 3% interest and the money supply expands at 7% to 10% a year,</p>
<p>and I ended up making a 10% return on a billion dollar investment paying 3% interest, is that fair?</p>
<p>And who suffered so that I could do that? Because in an environment where you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>inflating the money supply and you&rsquo;re holding the assets constant, it stands the reason that</p>
<p>the price of all the assets is going to appreciate somewhat proportional to the money supply.</p>
<p>And the difference in asset appreciations is going to be a function of the scarce desirable</p>
<p>quality of the assets, and to what extent can I make more of them, and to what extent are they</p>
<p>truly limited in supply? Yeah, so we&rsquo;ll get to a lot of the words you said there. The scarcity,</p>
<p>the scarcity, and so connected to how limited they are and the value of those</p>
<p>assets. But you also said, so the expansion of the money supply, which is put another way,</p>
<p>is printing money. And so is that always bad, the expansion of the money supply?</p>
<p>Just to put some terms on the table so we understand them. You nonchalantly say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always on average expanding every year, the money supply is expanding every year by 7%.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a bad thing? That&rsquo;s universally a bad thing? It&rsquo;s awful. I guess to be precise,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the currency. I would say money is monetary energy or economic energy. And the economic</p>
<p>energy has to find its way into a medium. So if you want to move it rapidly as a medium of exchange,</p>
<p>it has to find its way into currency. But the money can also flow into property, like a house</p>
<p>or gold. If the money flows into property, it&rsquo;ll probably hold its value much better if the money</p>
<p>flows into currency. If you had put $100,000 in this house, you would have 305x return over 92</p>
<p>years. But if you had put the money, $100,000, in a safe deposit box and buried it in the basement,</p>
<p>you would have lost 99.7% of your wealth over the same time period. So the expansion of the currency</p>
<p>creates a massive inefficiency in the society, what I&rsquo;ll call an adiabatic lapse. What we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing is we&rsquo;re bleeding the civilization to death. What&rsquo;s the adiabatic, what&rsquo;s that word?</p>
<p>Adiabatic lapse. Right. In aerospace engineering, you want to solve any problem, they start with</p>
<p>the phrase, assume an adiabatic system. And what that means is a closed system. So I&rsquo;ve got a</p>
<p>container and in that container, no air leaves and no air enters, no energy exits or enters.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a closed system. So you got the closed system lapse.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a leak in the ship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to use a physical metaphor for you because you&rsquo;re the jujitsu, right? Like you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got 10 pints of blood in your body. And so before your next workout, I&rsquo;m going to take one pint from</p>
<p>you. Now you&rsquo;re going to go exercise, but you&rsquo;ve lost 10% of your blood. You&rsquo;re not going to perform</p>
<p>as well. It takes about one month for your body to replace the red blood platelets. So what if I</p>
<p>tell you every month you got to show up and I&rsquo;m going to bleed you? Yeah. Okay. So if I&rsquo;m draining</p>
<p>the energy, I&rsquo;m draining the blood from your body, you can&rsquo;t perform. If you, adiabatic lapse is when</p>
<p>you go up in altitude, every thousand feet, you lose three degrees. You go at 50,000 feet, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>150 degrees colder than sea level. That&rsquo;s why you look at your instruments and instead of 80 degrees,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re minus 70 degrees. Why is the temperature falling? Temperature is falling because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a closed system, it&rsquo;s an open system. As the air expands, the density falls, the energy per cubic</p>
<p>whatever falls and therefore the temperature falls. The heat&rsquo;s falling out of the solution.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re inflating, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re inflating the currency supply by 6%,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sucking 6% of the energy out of the fluid that the economy is using to function.</p>
<p>So the currency, this kind of ocean of currency, that&rsquo;s a nice way for the economy to function.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most kind of, it&rsquo;s being inefficient when you expand the money supply, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the liquid. I&rsquo;m trying to find the right kind of adjective here. It&rsquo;s how you do transactions at</p>
<p>a scale of billions. Currency is the asset we use to move monetary energy around and you could use</p>
<p>the dollar or you could use the peso or you could use the bolivar. Selling houses and buying houses</p>
<p>is much more inefficient or like you can&rsquo;t transact between billions of people with houses.</p>
<p>Yeah. Properties don&rsquo;t make such good mediums of exchange. They make better stores of value</p>
<p>and they have utility value if it&rsquo;s a ship or a house or a plane or a bushel of corn, right?</p>
<p>Can I zoom out just for, can we zoom out? Keep zooming out until we reach</p>
<p>the origin of human civilization. But on the way, ask, you gave economists a D minus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even going to ask you what you give to governments.</p>
<p>Do you think their failure, economists and government failure is malevolence or incompetence?</p>
<p>I think policymakers are well intentioned, but generally all government policy is inflationary</p>
<p>and all government, it&rsquo;s inflammatory and inflationary. So what I mean by that is</p>
<p>when you have a policy pursuing supply chain independence, if you have an energy policy,</p>
<p>if you have a labor policy, if you have a trade policy, if you have any kind of foreign policy,</p>
<p>a domestic policy, a manufacturing policy, every one of these, a medical policy,</p>
<p>every one of these policies interferes with the free market and generally prevents some rational</p>
<p>actor from doing it in a cheaper, more efficient way. So when you layer them on top of each other,</p>
<p>they all have to be paid for. If you want to shut down the entire economy for a year,</p>
<p>you have to pay for it, right? If you want to fight a war, you have to pay for it,</p>
<p>pay for it, right? If you don&rsquo;t want to use oil or natural gas, you have to pay for it.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to manufacture semiconductors in China and you want to manufacture them in the</p>
<p>US, you got to pay for it. If I rebuild the entire supply chain in Pennsylvania and I hire a bunch of</p>
<p>employees and then I unionize the employees, then not only am I idle the factory in the Far East,</p>
<p>it goes to 50% capacity. So whatever it sells, it has to raise the price on. And then I drive up</p>
<p>the cost of labor for every other manufacturer in the US because I&rsquo;m competing against them,</p>
<p>right? I&rsquo;m changing that condition. So everything gets less efficient, everything gets more</p>
<p>expensive. And of course, the government couldn&rsquo;t really pay for its policies and its wars with</p>
<p>taxes. We didn&rsquo;t pay for World War I with tax. We didn&rsquo;t pay for World War II with tax. We didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>pay for Vietnam with tax. In fact, when you trace this, what you realize is the government never</p>
<p>pays for all of its policies with tax. Because it&rsquo;s too painful to ask to raise the taxes to</p>
<p>truly transparently pay for the things you&rsquo;re doing with taxes, with taxpayer money because</p>
<p>they feel the pain. That&rsquo;s one interpretation or it&rsquo;s just too transparent. If people understood</p>
<p>the true cost of war, they wouldn&rsquo;t want to go to war. If you were told that you would lose 95%</p>
<p>of your assets and 90% of everything you ever will be taken from you, you might reprioritize</p>
<p>your thought about a given policy and you might not vote for that politician. But you&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>saying incompetence, not malevolence. So fundamentally, government creates a bureaucracy</p>
<p>of incompetence is kind of how you look at it. I think a lack of humility. If people had more</p>
<p>humility, then they would realize. Humility about how little they know, how little they understand</p>
<p>about the function of complex systems. There&rsquo;s a phrase from Quint Eastwood&rsquo;s movie, Unforgiven,</p>
<p>where he says a man&rsquo;s got to know his limitations. I think that a lot of people overestimate</p>
<p>what they can accomplish and experience. Experience in life causes you to reevaluate that.</p>
<p>So I mean, I&rsquo;ve done a lot of things in my life and generally, my mistakes were always my good</p>
<p>ideas that I enthusiastically pursued to the detriment of my great ideas that required 150%</p>
<p>of my attention to prosper. So I think people pursue too many good ideas. They all sound good,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s just a limit to what you can accomplish. And everybody underestimates the</p>
<p>challenges of implementing an idea. And they always overestimate the benefits of the pursuit</p>
<p>of that. And so I think it&rsquo;s an overconfidence that causes an overexuberance in pursuit of</p>
<p>policies. And as the ambition of the government expands, so must the currency supply. Well,</p>
<p>I could say the money supply, but let&rsquo;s say the currency supply. You can triple the number of</p>
<p>pesos in the economy, but it doesn&rsquo;t triple the amount of manufacturing capacity in the set</p>
<p>economy. And it doesn&rsquo;t triple the amount of assets in the economy, it just triples the pesos. So</p>
<p>as you increase the currency supply, then the price of all those scarce desirable things</p>
<p>will tend to go up rapidly. And the confidence of all of the institutions, the corporations,</p>
<p>and the individual actors and trading partners will collapse.</p>
<p>TK If we take a tangent on a tangent, and we will return soon to the big human civilization</p>
<p>question. So if government naturally wants to buy stuff it can&rsquo;t afford,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the best form of government? Anarchism, libertarianism. So there&rsquo;s not even armies,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no borders, that&rsquo;s anarchism. The smallest possible, the best government would</p>
<p>be the least and the debate will be over that. TK When you think about this stuff,</p>
<p>do you think about, okay, government is the way it is, I as a person that can generate great ideas,</p>
<p>how do I operate in this world? Or do you also think about the big picture if we start a new</p>
<p>TK civilization somewhere on Mars, do you think about what&rsquo;s the ultimate form of government?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s at least a promising thing to try?</p>
<p>TK You know, I have laser eyes on my profile on Twitter, Lex.</p>
<p>TK What does that mean?</p>
<p>TK And the significance of laser eyes is to focus on the thing that can make a difference.</p>
<p>TK Yes.</p>
<p>TK And if I look at the civilization,</p>
<p>I would say half the problems in the civilization are due to the fact that our understanding of</p>
<p>economics and money is defective, half, 50%. I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s worth $500 trillion worth of</p>
<p>problems. Like money represents all the economic energy in the civilization and it kind of equates</p>
<p>to all the products, all the services and all the assets that we have and we&rsquo;re ever gonna have.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s half. The other half of the problems in the civilization are medical and military and</p>
<p>political and philosophical and natural. And I think that there are a lot of different solutions</p>
<p>to all those problems and they are all honorable professions and they all merit a lifetime of</p>
<p>consideration for the specialists in all those areas. I think that what I could offer it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>constructive is inflation is completely misunderstood. It&rsquo;s a much bigger problem</p>
<p>than we understand it to be. We need to introduce engineering and science</p>
<p>techniques into economics if we wanna further the human condition. All government policy is</p>
<p>inflationary. And another pernicious myth is inflation is always and everywhere a monetary</p>
<p>phenomenon. A famous quote by Milton Friedman, I believe, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a monetary phenomenon</p>
<p>that is inflation comes from expanding the currency supply. It&rsquo;s a nice phrase and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>oftentimes quoted by people that are anti inflation. But again, it just signifies a lack</p>
<p>of appreciation of what the issue is. Inflation is, if I had a currency which was completely</p>
<p>noninflationary, if I never printed another dollar, and if I eliminated fractional reserve</p>
<p>banking from the face of the earth, we&rsquo;d still have inflation. And we have inflation as long</p>
<p>as we have government that is capable of pursuing any kind of policies that are in themselves</p>
<p>inflationary and generally they all are. So in general, inflationary is the big</p>
<p>the big characteristic of human nature that governments collection of groups that have</p>
<p>power over others and allocate other people&rsquo;s resources will try to intentionally or not hide</p>
<p>the costs of those allocations, like in some tricky ways, whatever the options ever available.</p>
<p>You know, hiding the cost is like, is like the tertiary thing, like, the primary goal</p>
<p>is the government will attempt to do good. Right. And that&rsquo;s the fundamental, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the primary problem. They will attempt to do good and they will and they will do it.</p>
<p>They will do good imperfectly and they will create oftentimes as much damage,</p>
<p>more damage than the good they do. Most government policy will be iatrogenic. It will,</p>
<p>it will create more harm than good in the pursuit of it. But it is what it is.</p>
<p>The secondary, the secondary issue is they will unintentionally pay for it</p>
<p>by expanding the currency supply without realizing that they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>paying for it in in a suboptimal fashion. They&rsquo;ll collapse their own currencies while they attempt</p>
<p>to do good. The tertiary issue is they will mismeasure how badly they&rsquo;re collapsing the</p>
<p>currency. So for example, if you go to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, you know, and look at the</p>
<p>numbers printed by the Fed, they&rsquo;ll say, oh, it looks like the dollar&rsquo;s lost 95% of its purchasing</p>
<p>power over 100 years. Okay, they sort of fess up that there&rsquo;s a problem, but they make it 95%</p>
<p>loss over 100 years. What they don&rsquo;t do is realize it&rsquo;s a 99.7% loss over 80 years. So they will</p>
<p>mismeasure just the horrific extent of the monetary policy in pursuit of the foreign</p>
<p>policy and the domestic policy, which they overestimate their budget and their means to</p>
<p>accomplish their ends, and they underestimate the cost. And they&rsquo;re oblivious to the horrific</p>
<p>damage that they do to the civilization because the mental models that they use that are</p>
<p>conventionally taught are wrong, right? The mental model that, like, it&rsquo;s okay, we can print all this</p>
<p>money because the velocity of the money is low, right? Because money velocity is a scalar and</p>
<p>inflation is the scalar, and we don&rsquo;t see 2% inflation yet, and the money velocity is low,</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s okay if we print trillions of dollars. Well, the money velocity was immediate,</p>
<p>right? The velocity of money through the crypto economy is 10,000 times faster than the velocity</p>
<p>of money through the consumer economy, right? I think Nick pointed out when you spoke to him,</p>
<p>he said it takes two months for a credit card transaction to settle, right? So you want to</p>
<p>spend a million dollars in the consumer economy, you can move it six times a year.</p>
<p>You put a million dollars into gold, gold will sit in a vault for a decade, okay? So the velocity</p>
<p>of money through gold is 0.1. You put the money in the stock market and you can trade it once a</p>
<p>week, the settlement is T plus 2, maybe you get to 2 to 1 leverage. You might get to a money</p>
<p>velocity of 100 a year in the stock market. You put your money into the crypto economy,</p>
<p>and these people are settling every four hours. And you know, if you&rsquo;re offshore,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trading with 20x leverage. So if you settle every day and you trade the 20x leverage,</p>
<p>you just went to 7,000. So the velocity of the money varies. I think the politicians,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t really understand inflation and they don&rsquo;t understand economics, but you can&rsquo;t blame</p>
<p>them because the economists don&rsquo;t understand economics. Because if they did, they would be</p>
<p>creating multivariate computer simulations where they actually put in the price of every piece of</p>
<p>housing in every city in the world, the full array of foods, and the full array of products,</p>
<p>and the full array of assets. And then on a monthly basis, they would publish all those</p>
<p>results. And that&rsquo;s a high bandwidth requirement. And I think that people don&rsquo;t really want to</p>
<p>embrace it. And also, the most pernicious thing, there&rsquo;s that phrase, you know, you can&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>people what to think, but you can tell them what to think about. The most pernicious thing is I get</p>
<p>you to misunderstand the phenomena so that even when it&rsquo;s happening to you, you don&rsquo;t appreciate</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a bad thing and you think it&rsquo;s a good thing. So if housing prices are going up 20% year</p>
<p>over year, and I say, this is great for the American public because most of them are homeowners,</p>
<p>then I have misrepresented a phenomena. Inflation is 20%, not 7%. And then I have misrepresented it</p>
<p>as being a positive rather than a negative. And people will stare at it and you could even show</p>
<p>them their house on fire and they would perceive it as being great because it&rsquo;s warming them up</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to save on their heat costs. It does seem that the cruder the model,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s economics, whether it&rsquo;s psychology, the easier it is to weave whatever the heck</p>
<p>narrative you want and not in a malicious way, but just like it&rsquo;s some kind of emergent phenomena,</p>
<p>this narrative thing that we tell ourselves. So you can tell any kind of story about inflation.</p>
<p>Inflation is good, inflation is bad. The cruder the model, the easier it is to tell a narrative</p>
<p>about it. So if you take an engineering approach, I feel like it becomes more and more difficult</p>
<p>to run away from sort of a true deep understanding of the dynamics of the system.</p>
<p>I mean, honestly, if you went to 100 people on the street and you asked them to define inflation,</p>
<p>how many would say it&rsquo;s a vector tracking the change in price of every product service</p>
<p>asset in the world over time? Not many. Now, if you went to them and you said,</p>
<p>do you think 2% inflation a year is good or bad? The majority would probably say,</p>
<p>well, I hear it&rsquo;s good. The majority of economists would say 2% inflation a year is good.</p>
<p>And of course, look at the ship next to us. What if I told you that the ship leaked 2% of its</p>
<p>volume every something, right? The ship is rotting 2% a year. That means the useful life of the ship</p>
<p>is 50 years. Now, ironically, that&rsquo;s true. Like a wooden ship had a 50 year to 100 year life,</p>
<p>100 would be long, 50 years, not unlikely. So when we built ships out of wood,</p>
<p>they had a useful life of about 50 years and then they sunk, they rotted. There&rsquo;s nothing good about</p>
<p>it, right? You build a ship out of steel and it&rsquo;s zero as opposed to 2% degradation. And how much</p>
<p>better is 0% versus 2%? Well, 2% means you have a useful life of, you know, it&rsquo;s half life of 35</p>
<p>years. 2% is a half life of 35 years. That&rsquo;s basically the half life of money and gold.</p>
<p>If I store your life force in gold, under perfect circumstances, you have a useful life of 35 years.</p>
<p>0% is a useful life of forever. So 0% is immortal. 2% is 35 years average life expectancy.</p>
<p>So the idea that you would think the life expectancy of the currency and the civilization</p>
<p>should be 35 years instead of forever is kind of a silly notion. But the tragic notion is it was,</p>
<p>you know, seven into 70 or 10 years. The money has had a half life of 10 years except for the fact</p>
<p>that in weak societies in Argentina or the like, the half life of the money is three to four years</p>
<p>in Venezuela, one year. So the United States dollar and the United States economic system</p>
<p>was the most successful economic system in the last hundred years in the world. We won every war.</p>
<p>We were the world superpower. Our currency lost 99.7% of its value. And that means, horrifically,</p>
<p>every other currency lost everything. In essence, the other ones were 99.9% except for most that</p>
<p>were 100% because they all completely failed. And, you know, you&rsquo;ve got a mainstream economic</p>
<p>community, you know, that thinks that inflation is a number and 2% is desirable. It&rsquo;s kind of like,</p>
<p>you know, remember George Washington? You know how he died? Well meaning physicians bled him to</p>
<p>death. Okay, the last thing in the world you would want to do to a sick person is bleed them,</p>
<p>right? In the modern world, I think we understand that oxygen is carried by the blood cells and,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s that phrase, right? A triage phrase, what&rsquo;s the first thing you do in an</p>
<p>injury? Stop the bleeding. Single first thing, right? You show up after any accident, I look at</p>
<p>you, stop the bleeding because you&rsquo;re going to be dead in a matter of minutes if you bleed out.</p>
<p>So it strikes me as being ironic that orthodox conventional wisdom was bleed the patient to</p>
<p>death. And this was the most important patient in the country, maybe in the history of the country,</p>
<p>and we bled him to death trying to help him. So when you&rsquo;re actually inflating the money supply</p>
<p>at 7% but you&rsquo;re calling it 2% because you want to help the economy, you&rsquo;re literally bleeding</p>
<p>the free market to death. But the sad fact is George Washington went along with it because he</p>
<p>thought that they were going to do him good. And the majority of the people who were in the</p>
<p>majority of the society, most companies, most conventional thinkers, you know, the working class,</p>
<p>they go along with this because they think that someone has their best interest of mind and the</p>
<p>people that are bleeding them to death believe that prescription because their mental models</p>
<p>are just so defective. And then an understanding of energy and engineering and the economics that</p>
<p>are at play is crippled by these mental models. But that&rsquo;s both the bug in the future of human</p>
<p>civilization that ideas take hold, they unite us, we believe in them, and we make a lot of cool stuff</p>
<p>happen by, as an average, sort of just the fact of the matter, a lot of people believe the same</p>
<p>thing, they get together and they get some shit done because they believe that thing. And then</p>
<p>some ideas can be really bad and really destructive, but on average the ideas seem to be progressing</p>
<p>in a direction of good. Let me just step back. What the hell are we doing here, us humans on</p>
<p>this earth? How do you think of humans? How special are humans? How did human civilization</p>
<p>originate on this earth? And what is this human project that we&rsquo;re all taking on?</p>
<p>You mentioned fire and water and apparently bleeding you to death is not a good idea.</p>
<p>I always thought you can get the demons out in that way, but that was a recent</p>
<p>invention. So what&rsquo;s this thing we&rsquo;re doing here? I think what distinguishes human beings from</p>
<p>all the other creatures on the earth is our ability to engineer. We&rsquo;re engineers, right?</p>
<p>To solve problems or just build incredible cool things?</p>
<p>Engineering, harnessing energy and technique to make the world a better place than you found it.</p>
<p>Right? From the point that we actually started to play with fire, right? That was a big leap forward.</p>
<p>Harnessing the power of kinetic energy and missiles, another step forward. Every city</p>
<p>built on water. Why water? Well, water is bringing energy, right? If you actually put a turbine</p>
<p>on a river or you capture a change in elevation of water, you&rsquo;ve literally harnessed gravitational</p>
<p>energy. But water is also bringing you food. It&rsquo;s also giving you a cheap form of getting</p>
<p>rid of your waste. It&rsquo;s also giving you free transportation. You want to move one ton blocks</p>
<p>around. You want to move them in water. So I think, I mean, the human story is really the</p>
<p>story of engineering a better world. And the rise in the human condition is determined by those</p>
<p>groups of people, those civilizations that were best at harnessing energy.</p>
<p>Right? If you look at the Greek civilization, they built it around ports and seaports and</p>
<p>water and created a trading network. The Romans were really good at harnessing all sorts of</p>
<p>engineering. I mean, the aqueducts are a great example. If you go to any big city,</p>
<p>you travel through cities in the Med, you find that the carrying capacity of the city or the</p>
<p>island is 5,000 people without running water. And then if you can find a way to bring water to it,</p>
<p>it increases by a factor of 10. And so human flourishing is really only possible through</p>
<p>that channeling of energy, right? That eventually takes the form of air power, right? I mean,</p>
<p>that ship, I mean, look at the intricacy of those sails. I mean, it&rsquo;s just the model is intricate.</p>
<p>Now think about all of the experimentation that took place to figure out how many sails to put</p>
<p>on that ship and how to rig them and how to repair them and how to operate them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s thousands of lives spent thinking through all the tiny little details,</p>
<p>all to increase the efficiency of this, the effectiveness, the efficiency of this ship</p>
<p>as it sails to water. And we should also note there&rsquo;s a bunch of cannons on the side.</p>
<p>So obviously another form of engineering, right? Energy harnessing with explosives</p>
<p>to achieve what end? That&rsquo;s another discussion. Exactly. Suppose we&rsquo;re trying to get off the</p>
<p>planet, right? I mean, well, there&rsquo;s a selection mechanism going on. So natural selection,</p>
<p>this, whatever, however evolution works, it seems that one of the interesting inventions on earth</p>
<p>was the predator prey dynamic that you want to be the bigger fish.</p>
<p>That violence seems to serve a useful purpose. If you look at earth as a whole,</p>
<p>we as humans now like to think of violence is really a bad thing. It seems to be one of the</p>
<p>amazing things about humans is we&rsquo;re ultimately tend towards cooperation. We want to, we like peace.</p>
<p>If you just look at history, we want things to be nice and calm and</p>
<p>calm. But just wars break out every once in a while and lead to immense suffering</p>
<p>and destruction and so on. And they have a kind of like resetting the palette</p>
<p>effect. It&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s full of just immeasurable human suffering, but it&rsquo;s like a way to start over.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re quite the apex predator on the planet. And I Googled something the other day,</p>
<p>you know, what&rsquo;s the most common form of mammal life on earth?</p>
<p>By number of organisms?</p>
<p>Count.</p>
<p>By count.</p>
<p>And the answer that came back was human beings. I was shocked. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it, right? It says</p>
<p>apparently if we&rsquo;re just looking at mammals, the answer was human beings are the most common,</p>
<p>which was very interesting to me. I almost didn&rsquo;t believe it, but I was trying to,</p>
<p>you know, eight billion or so human beings. There&rsquo;s no other mammal that&rsquo;s got more than</p>
<p>eight billion. If you walk through downtown Edinburgh and Scotland and you look up on this</p>
<p>hill and this castle up on the hill, you know, and you talk to people and the story is, oh yeah,</p>
<p>well that was a British castle, before it&rsquo;s a Scottish castle, before it was a Pict castle,</p>
<p>before it was a Roman castle, before it was, you know, some other Celtic castle.</p>
<p>Then they found 13 prehistoric castles buried one under the other under the other.</p>
<p>And you get to the conclusion that 100,000 years ago, somebody showed up and grabbed the high</p>
<p>point, the apex of the city, and they built a stronghold there, and they flourished,</p>
<p>and their family flourished, and their tribe flourished until someone came along and knocked</p>
<p>them off the hill. And it&rsquo;s been a nonstop, never ending fight by the the aggressive,</p>
<p>most powerful entity, family, organization, municipality, tribe, whatever.</p>
<p>All for the hill.</p>
<p>For that one hill, going back since time immemorial. And, you know,</p>
<p>you scratch your head and you think, it seems like it&rsquo;s like just this never ending.</p>
<p>But doesn&rsquo;t that lead, if you just, all kinds of metrics, that seems to improve the quality</p>
<p>of our cannons and ships as a result. Like, it seems that war, just like your laser eyes,</p>
<p>focuses the mind on the engineering tasks.</p>
<p>It is that. And it does remind you that the winner is always the most powerful.</p>
<p>And we throw that phrase out, but no one thinks about what that phrase means.</p>
<p>Like, who&rsquo;s the most powerful, or the, you know, or the most powerful side one,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t think about it. And they think about power, energy delivered in a period of</p>
<p>time. And then you think a guy with a spear is more powerful than someone with their fist,</p>
<p>and someone with a bow and arrow is more powerful than the person with the spear.</p>
<p>And then you realize that somebody with bronze is more powerful than without,</p>
<p>and steel is more powerful than bronze. And if you look at the Romans, you know,</p>
<p>they persevered, you know, with artillery, and they could stand off from 800 meters and</p>
<p>blast you to smithereens. You know, you study the history of the Balearic slingers, right?</p>
<p>And, you know, you think we invented bullets, but they invented bullets to put in slings</p>
<p>thousands of years ago. They could have stood off 500 meters and put a hole in your head,</p>
<p>right? And so there was never a time when humanity wasn&rsquo;t vying to come up with an asymmetric form</p>
<p>of projecting their own power via technology.</p>
<p>And absolute power is when a leader is able to control a large amount of humans, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re facing the same direction, working in the same direction to leverage energy.</p>
<p>The most organized society wins.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>When the Romans were dominating everybody, they were the most organized civilization</p>
<p>in Europe. And as long as they stayed organized, they dominated, and at some point they overexpanded</p>
<p>and got disorganized and they collapsed. And I guess you could say that, you know,</p>
<p>the struggle of human condition, it catalyzes the development of new technologies one after</p>
<p>the other. It penalizes anybody that rejects ocean power, right, gets penalized. You reject</p>
<p>artillery, you get penalized. You reject atomic power, you get penalized. If you reject digital</p>
<p>power, cyber power, you get penalized. And the underlying control of the property keeps</p>
<p>shifting hands from, you know, one institution or one government to another based upon how</p>
<p>rationally they&rsquo;re able to channel that energy and how well organized or coordinated they are.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a really interesting thing about both the human mind and governments,</p>
<p>that they, once they get a few good, and companies, once they get a few good ideas,</p>
<p>they seem to stick with them. They reject new ideas. It&rsquo;s almost, whether that&rsquo;s emergent or</p>
<p>or however that evolved, it seems to have a really interesting effect because when you&rsquo;re young,</p>
<p>you fight for the new ideas. You push them through. Then a few of us humans find success.</p>
<p>Then we get complacent. We take over the world using that new idea. And then the new young person</p>
<p>with the better new idea challenges you. And you, as opposed to pivoting, you stick with the old</p>
<p>and lose because of it. And that&rsquo;s how empires collapse. And it&rsquo;s just both at the individual</p>
<p>level that happens when two academics fighting about ideas or something like that, and at the</p>
<p>at the human civilization level, governments, they hold on to the ideas of old. It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Jay Famiglietti An ever persistent theme in the history of science is the paradigm shift. And</p>
<p>the paradigms shift when the old guard dies and a new generation arrives, or the paradigm shifts</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a war and everyone that disagrees with the idea of aviation finds bombs dropping</p>
<p>on their head, or everyone that disagrees with whatever your technology is has a rude awakening.</p>
<p>And if they totally disagree, their society collapses, and they&rsquo;re replaced by that new thing.</p>
<p>Trey Lockerbie A lot of the engineering you talked</p>
<p>about had to do with ships and cannons and leveraging water. What about this whole digital</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s happening, been happening over the past century? Is that still engineering in your</p>
<p>mind? You&rsquo;re starting to operate in these bits of information?</p>
<p>Jay Famiglietti I think there&rsquo;s two big ideas.</p>
<p>The first wave of ideas were digital information. And that was the internet way been running since</p>
<p>1990 or so for 30 years. And the second wave is digital energy. So if I look at digital information,</p>
<p>this idea that we want to digitally transform a book, I&rsquo;m going to dematerialize every book</p>
<p>in this room into bits. And then I&rsquo;m going to deliver a copy of the entire library to a billion</p>
<p>people. And I&rsquo;m going to do it for pretty much de minimis electricity. If I can dematerialize music,</p>
<p>books, education, entertainment, maps, that is an incredibly exothermic transaction. It</p>
<p>gives&hellip; It&rsquo;s a crystallization when we collapse into a lower energy state as a civilization and</p>
<p>we give off massive amounts of energy. If you look at what Carnegie did, the richest man in the world</p>
<p>created libraries everywhere at the time, and he gave away his entire fortune. And now we can give</p>
<p>a better library to every six year old for nothing. And so what&rsquo;s the value of giving a</p>
<p>million books to eight billion people? That&rsquo;s the explosion in prosperity that comes from</p>
<p>digital transformation. And when we do it with maps, I transform the map, I put it into a car,</p>
<p>you get in the car and the car drives you where you want to go with the map. And how much better</p>
<p>is that than a Rand McNally Atlas right here? It&rsquo;s like a million times better. So the first wave of</p>
<p>digital transformation was the dematerialization of all of these informational things which are</p>
<p>non conservative. I could take Beethoven&rsquo;s Fifth Symphony, played for by the best orchestra in</p>
<p>Germany, and I could give it to a billion people and they could play it a thousand times each</p>
<p>at less than the cost of the one performance. So I deliver culture and education and erudition and</p>
<p>intelligence and insight to the entire civilization over digital rails. And the consequences of the</p>
<p>human race are first order, generally good, right? The world is a better place, it drives growth,</p>
<p>and you create these trillion dollar entities like Apple and Amazon and Facebook and Google</p>
<p>and Microsoft, right? That is the first wave. The second wave&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to interrupt, but that first wave, it feels like the impact that&rsquo;s positive,</p>
<p>you said the first order impact is generally positive. It feels like it&rsquo;s positive in a way</p>
<p>that nothing else in history has been positive. And then we may not actually truly be able to</p>
<p>understand the orders and magnitude of increase in productivity and just progress of human</p>
<p>civilization until we look back centuries from now. It just feels, or maybe, just looking at</p>
<p>the impact of Wikipedia, giving access to basic wisdom or basic knowledge and then perhaps wisdom</p>
<p>to billions of people. If you can just linger on that for a second, what&rsquo;s your sense of the</p>
<p>impact of that? You know, I would say if you&rsquo;re a technologist philosopher,</p>
<p>the impact of a technology is so much greater on the civilization and the human condition</p>
<p>than a non technology that is almost not worth your trouble to bother trying to fix things that</p>
<p>conventional way. So let&rsquo;s take example. I have a foundation, the Saylor Academy, and the Saylor</p>
<p>Academy gives away free education, free college education to anybody on earth that wants it.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve had more than a million students. And if you go and you take the physics class,</p>
<p>the lectures were by the same physics lecturer that taught me physics at MIT.</p>
<p>Except when I was at MIT, the cost of the first four weeks of MIT would have drained my family&rsquo;s</p>
<p>life, collective life savings for the first last hundred years. Like a hundred years worth of my</p>
<p>father, my grandfather, my great grandfather, they saved every penny they had after a hundred</p>
<p>years. They could have paid for one week or two weeks of MIT. That&rsquo;s how fiendishly expensive and</p>
<p>inefficient it was. So I went on scholarship. I was lucky to have a scholarship. But on the other</p>
<p>hand, I sat in the back of the 801 lecture hall and I was like right up in the rafters.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an awful experience on these like uncomfortable wooden benches and you can</p>
<p>barely see the blackboard. And you got to be there synchronously. And the stuff we upload,</p>
<p>you can start it and stop it and watch it on your iPad or watch it on your computer</p>
<p>and rewind it multiple times and sit in a comfortable chair and you can do it from</p>
<p>anywhere on earth and it&rsquo;s absolutely free. So I think about this and I think you want to improve</p>
<p>the human condition. You need people with postgraduate level education. You need PhDs.</p>
<p>And I know this sounds kind of elitist, but you want to cure cancer and you want to go to the</p>
<p>stars, fusion drive. We need new propulsion, right? We need extraordinary breakthroughs</p>
<p>in every area of basic science, you know, be it biology or propulsion or material science or</p>
<p>computer science. You&rsquo;re not doing that with an undergraduate degree. You&rsquo;re certainly not doing</p>
<p>it with a high school education. But the cost of a PhD is like a million bucks. There&rsquo;s like 10</p>
<p>million PhDs in the world if you check it out. There&rsquo;s 8 billion people in the world. How many</p>
<p>people could get a PhD or would want to? Maybe not 8 billion, but a billion, 500 million. Let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>say 500 million to a billion. How do you go from 10 million to a billion highly educated people,</p>
<p>all of them specializing in, and I don&rsquo;t have to tell you how many different fields of human</p>
<p>endeavor there are. I mean, your life is interviewing these experts and there&rsquo;s so many,</p>
<p>right? You know, it&rsquo;s amazing. So how do I give a multimillion dollar education to a billion people?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s two choices. You can either endow a scholarship, in which case you pay $75,000 a year.</p>
<p>Okay. $75,000. Let&rsquo;s pay a million dollars a person. I can do it that way. And you&rsquo;re never,</p>
<p>even if you had a trillion dollars, if you had $10 trillion to throw at the problem,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve just thrown $10 trillion at certain problems, you don&rsquo;t solve the problem, right?</p>
<p>If I put $10 trillion on the table and I said educate everybody, give them all a PhD,</p>
<p>you still wouldn&rsquo;t solve the problem. Harvard University can&rsquo;t educate 18,000 people</p>
<p>simultaneously, or 87,000, or 800,000, or 8 million. So you have to dematerialize the</p>
<p>professor and dematerialize the experience. So you put it all as streaming on demand,</p>
<p>computer generated education, and you create simulations where you need to create simulations,</p>
<p>and you upload it. It&rsquo;s like the human condition is being held back by 500,000 well meaning</p>
<p>average algebra teachers. I love them. I mean, please don&rsquo;t take offense if you&rsquo;re an algebra</p>
<p>teacher, but instead of 500,000 algebra teachers going through the same motion over and over again,</p>
<p>what you need is like one, or five, or 10 really good algebra teachers, and they need to do it a</p>
<p>billion times a day, or a billion times a year for free. And if we do that, there&rsquo;s no reason</p>
<p>why you can&rsquo;t give infinite education, certainly in science, technology, engineering, and math,</p>
<p>right? Infinite education to everybody with no constraint. And I think the same is true,</p>
<p>right? With just about every other thing. If you want to bring joy to the world,</p>
<p>you need digital music. If you want to bring enlightenment to the world, you need digital</p>
<p>education. If you want to bring anything of consequence in the world, you got to digitally</p>
<p>transform it. And then you got to manufacture it something like a hundred times more efficiently</p>
<p>as a start, but a million times more efficiently is probably, you know, that&rsquo;s hopeful. Maybe you</p>
<p>have a chance. And if you look at all of these space endeavors and everything we&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about getting to Mars, getting off the planet, getting to other worlds, number one thing you</p>
<p>got to do is you got to make a fundamental breakthrough in an engine. People dreamed</p>
<p>about flying for thousands of years, but until the internal combustion engine,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t have enough, you know, enough energy, enough power in a light enough package</p>
<p>in order to solve the problem. And the human race has all sorts of those fundamental</p>
<p>all engines and materials and techniques that we need to master. And each one of them is a lifetime</p>
<p>of experimentation of someone capable of making a seminal contribution to the body of human</p>
<p>knowledge. There are certain problems like education that could be solved through this</p>
<p>process of dematerialization. And by the way, to give props to the 500k algebra teachers,</p>
<p>when I look at YouTube, for example, one possible approach is each one of those 500,000 teachers</p>
<p>probably had days and moments of brilliance. And if they had the ability to contribute to</p>
<p>in the natural selection process, like the market of education, where the best ones rise up, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a really interesting way, which is like the best day of your life, the best lesson you&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>the best lesson you&rsquo;ve ever taught could be found and sort of broadcast to billions of people.</p>
<p>So all of those kinds of ideas can be made real in the digital world. Now traveling across planets,</p>
<p>you still can&rsquo;t solve that problem with dematerialization. What you could solve</p>
<p>potentially is dematerializing the human brain where you can transfer, like you don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>have astronauts on the ship, you can have a floppy disk carrying a human brain.</p>
<p>Touching on those points, you&rsquo;d love for the 500,000 algebra teachers to become 500,000 math</p>
<p>specialists, and maybe they clump into 50,000 specialties as teams, and they all pursue 50,000</p>
<p>new problems, and they put their algebra teaching on autopilot. That&rsquo;s the same as when I give you</p>
<p>11 cents worth of electricity and you don&rsquo;t have to row a boat eight hours a day before you can</p>
<p>eat. It would be a lot better that you would pay for your food in the first eight seconds of your</p>
<p>day and then you could start thinking about other things, right? With regard to technology, one</p>
<p>thing that I learned studying technology when you look at S curves is until you start the S curve,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know whether you&rsquo;re a hundred years from viability, a thousand years from viability,</p>
<p>or a few months from viability. Isn&rsquo;t that fun? That&rsquo;s so fun. The early part of the S curve is</p>
<p>so fun because you don&rsquo;t know. In 1900, you could have got any number of learned academics to give</p>
<p>you 10,000 reasons why humans will never fly, right? And in 1903, the Wright brothers flew,</p>
<p>and by 1969, we&rsquo;re walking on the moon. So the advance that we made in that field was extraordinary,</p>
<p>but for the hundred years and 200 years before, they were just back and forth and nobody was</p>
<p>close. And that&rsquo;s the happy part. The happy part is we went from flying 20 miles an hour or whatever</p>
<p>to flying 25,000 miles an hour in 66 years. The unhappy part is I studied aeronautical</p>
<p>engineering at MIT in the 80s. And in the 80s, we had Gulfstream aircraft, we had Boeing 737s,</p>
<p>we had the Space Shuttle. And you fast forward 40 years and we pretty much had the same exact</p>
<p>aircraft. The efficiency of the engines was 20, 30% more. We slammed into a brick wall around</p>
<p>69 to 75. In fact, the Global Express, the Gulfstream, these were all engineered in the 70s,</p>
<p>some in the 60s. The fuselage silhouette of a Gulfstream of a G5 was the same shape as a G4,</p>
<p>is the same shape as a G3, is the same shape as a G2. And that&rsquo;s because they were afraid to change</p>
<p>the shape for 40 years because they worked it out in a wind tunnel, they knew it worked.</p>
<p>And when they finally decided to change the shape, it was like a $10 billion exercise with modern</p>
<p>supercomputers and computational fluid dynamics. Why was it so hard? What is that wall made of</p>
<p>that you slammed into? The right question is, so why does a guy that went to MIT that got an</p>
<p>aeronautical engineering degree spend his career in software? Why is it that I never a day in my</p>
<p>life, with the exception of some Air Force Reserve work, I never got paid to be an aeronautical</p>
<p>engineer and I worked in software engineering my entire career. Maybe software engineering</p>
<p>is the new aeronautical engineering in some way. Maybe you hit fundamental walls uncertain</p>
<p>until you have to return to it centuries later. Or no.</p>
<p>STUART The National Gallery of Art was endowed by a very rich man,</p>
<p>Andrew Mellon. And you know how he made his money? Aluminum. Okay? And so,</p>
<p>and you know what kind of airplanes you can create without aluminum? Nothing. Nothing, right?</p>
<p>LARRY So it&rsquo;s a materials problem.</p>
<p>STUART Okay, so 1900, we made massive advances in metallurgy, right? I mean, that was US steel,</p>
<p>that was iron to steel, aluminum, massive fortunes were created because this was a massive technical</p>
<p>advance. And then we also had the internal combustion engine and, you know, the story of Ford</p>
<p>and General Motors and Daimler Chrysler and the like is informed by that. So you have no jet</p>
<p>engines, no rocket motors, no internal combustion engines, you have no aviation. But even if you had</p>
<p>those engines, if you were trying to build those things with steel, no chance. You had to have</p>
<p>aluminum. So there&rsquo;s like two pretty basic technologies. And once you have those two</p>
<p>technologies, stuff happens very fast. So tell me the last big advance in like jet engines,</p>
<p>there hasn&rsquo;t been one. Like the last big advance in rocket engines, hasn&rsquo;t been one. The big</p>
<p>advances in spaceship design from what I can see are in the control systems, the gyros and the</p>
<p>ability to land, right, in a stable fashion. That&rsquo;s pretty amazing, landing a rocket. Also in the,</p>
<p>at least according to Elon and so on, the manufacture of the more efficient and less</p>
<p>expensive manufacture of rockets. So like it&rsquo;s a production, whatever that you call that</p>
<p>discipline of at scale manufacture, at scale production, so factory work. But it&rsquo;s not 10X.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe it&rsquo;s 10X over a period of a few decades.</p>
<p>When we figure out how to operate a spaceship, you know, on the water in your water bottle for</p>
<p>a year, right? Now, then you&rsquo;ve got to break through. So the bottom line is propulsion,</p>
<p>propellant, propulsion technology, propellants and the materials technology, they were critical</p>
<p>to getting on that aviation S curve. And then we slammed into a wall. And then we had to</p>
<p>switch to a new S curve in the 70s. And the Boeing 747, the Global Express, the Gulf Stream,</p>
<p>these things were, the Space Shuttle, they were all pretty much reflective of that. And then we</p>
<p>kind of, then we stopped. And at that point, you have to switch to a new S curve. So the next</p>
<p>equivalent to the internal combustion engine was the CPU. And the next aluminum equipment was</p>
<p>the S curve. And then we actually started developing CPUs. The transistor gave way to CPUs.</p>
<p>And if you look at the power, right, the bandwidth that we had on computers and Moore&rsquo;s law, right?</p>
<p>What if the efficiency of jet engines had doubled every three years, right, in the last 40 years,</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;d be right now, right? So I think that if you&rsquo;re a business person, if you&rsquo;re looking for</p>
<p>a real application of your mind, then you have to find that S curve. And ideally,</p>
<p>you have to find it in the first five, six, 10 years. But people always miss this. Let&rsquo;s take</p>
<p>Google Glass, right? Google Glass was an idea in 2013. The year is 2022. And people were quite sure</p>
<p>this was going to be a big thing. And it could have been at the beginning of the S curve.</p>
<p>But fundamentally, we didn&rsquo;t really have an effective mechanism. I mean, people getting</p>
<p>vertigo and they&rsquo;re, you know. But you didn&rsquo;t know that at the beginning of the S curve, right? I mean,</p>
<p>maybe some people had a deep intuition about the fundamentals of augmented reality. But you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know that. You don&rsquo;t have those, you&rsquo;re looking through the fog. You don&rsquo;t know. So the point is,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re year zero in 2013. And we&rsquo;re still year zero in 2022 on that augmented reality. And when</p>
<p>somebody puts out a set of glasses that you can wear comfortably without getting vertigo,</p>
<p>right? Without any disorientation that managed to have the stability and the bandwidth necessary to</p>
<p>sync with the real world, you&rsquo;ll be in year one. And from that point, you&rsquo;ll have a 70 year or</p>
<p>some interesting future until you slam into a limit to growth. And then it&rsquo;ll slow down.</p>
<p>And this is the story of a lot of things, right? I mean, John D. Rockefeller got in the oil business</p>
<p>in the 1860s. And the oil business, as we understood it, became fairly mature by the 1920s,</p>
<p>the 30s. And then it actually stayed that way until we got to fracking, which was like seven</p>
<p>years later, and then it burst forward. So&hellip; The interesting story about Moore&rsquo;s law, though,</p>
<p>is that you get this constant burst of S curves on top of S curves on top of S curve. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the moment you start slowing down, or almost ahead of you slowing down, you come up with another</p>
<p>innovation, another innovation. So Moore&rsquo;s law doesn&rsquo;t seem to happen in every</p>
<p>technological advancement. It seems like you only get a couple of S curves and then you&rsquo;re done</p>
<p>for a bit. So I wonder what the pressures there are that resulted in such success over several</p>
<p>decades and still going. Humility dictates that nobody knows when the S curve kicks off,</p>
<p>and you could be 20 years early or 100 years early. Leonardo da Vinci, you know,</p>
<p>they were&hellip; Michelangelo, they were designing flying machines hundreds and hundreds of years ago.</p>
<p>So humility says you&rsquo;re not quite sure when you really hit that commercial viability,</p>
<p>and it also dictates you don&rsquo;t know when it ends. Like, when will the party stop? When will</p>
<p>Moore&rsquo;s law stop and we&rsquo;ll get to the point where they&rsquo;re exponentially diminishing returns on</p>
<p>silicon performance? And when you&hellip; Just like we got exponentially diminishing returns on jet</p>
<p>engines, you know, and it just takes an exponential increase in effort to make it 10% better.</p>
<p>But while you&rsquo;re in the middle of it, then you know you can do things. So the reason that the</p>
<p>digital revolution is so important is because the underlying platforms, the bandwidth of and the</p>
<p>performance of the components, and I say the components are the radio protocols, mobile</p>
<p>protocols, the batteries, the CPUs, and the displays, right? Those four components are</p>
<p>pretty critical. They&rsquo;re all critical in the creation of an iPhone. I wrote about it in the</p>
<p>book, The Mobile Wave, and they catalyzed this entire mobile revolution. Because they have</p>
<p>advanced and continue to advance, they created the very fertile environment for all these digital</p>
<p>transformations. And the digital transformations themselves, right? They call for creativity in</p>
<p>their own, right? Like, I think the interesting thing about&hellip; Let&rsquo;s take digital maps, right? When</p>
<p>you conceptualize something as a dematerialized map, right? It becomes a map because I can put it</p>
<p>on a display, like an iPad, or I can put it in a car, like a Tesla. But if you really want to</p>
<p>figure it out, you can&rsquo;t think like an engineer. You need to think like a fantasy writer. Like,</p>
<p>this is where it&rsquo;s useful if you studied&hellip; If you read&hellip; Played Dungeons and Dragons, and you read</p>
<p>Lord of the Rings, and you studied all the fantasy literature. Because when I dematerialize the map,</p>
<p>first I put 10 million pages of satellite imagery into the map, right? That&rsquo;s a simple physical</p>
<p>transform. But then I start to put telemetry into the map, and I keep track of the traffic</p>
<p>rates on the roads. And I tell you whether you&rsquo;ll be in a traffic jam if you drive that way, and I</p>
<p>tell you which way to drive. And then I start to get feedback on where you&rsquo;re going, and I tell</p>
<p>you the restaurants closed, and people don&rsquo;t like it anyway. And then I put an AI on the map, and</p>
<p>then I put an AI on top of it, and I have it drive your car for you. And eventually, the implication</p>
<p>of digital transformation of maps is, I get in a self driving car, and I say, take me someplace</p>
<p>cool where I can eat. And how did you get to that last step, right? It wasn&rsquo;t simple engineering.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bit of fantasy in there, a bit of magic. Design, art, whatever the heck you call it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s whatever, yeah, fantasy injects magic into the engineering process. Imagination</p>
<p>precedes great revolutions in engineering. It&rsquo;s like imagining a world of what you can do with</p>
<p>the display. How will the interaction be? That&rsquo;s where Google Glass actually came in, augmented</p>
<p>reality, virtual reality. People were playing in the space of sci fi, imagination.</p>
<p>They called a moonshot. They tried. It didn&rsquo;t work, but to their credit, they stopped trying,</p>
<p>right? And then there&rsquo;s new people. They keep dreaming. Dreamers all around us. I love those</p>
<p>dreamers, and most of them fail and suffer because of it. But some of them win Nobel prizes or become</p>
<p>billionaires. Well, what I would say is, if half the civilization dropped what they were doing</p>
<p>tomorrow and eagerly started working on launching a rocket to Alpha Centauri,</p>
<p>it might not be the best use of our resources because it&rsquo;s kind of like if half of Athens</p>
<p>in the year 500 BC eagerly started working on flying machines. If you went back and you said,</p>
<p>what advice would you give them? You would say, you know, it&rsquo;s not going to work till you get to</p>
<p>aluminum. And you&rsquo;re not going to get to aluminum until you work out the steel and certain other</p>
<p>things. And you&rsquo;re not going to get to that until you work out the calculus of variations and some</p>
<p>metallurgy. And there&rsquo;s a dude, Newton, that won&rsquo;t come along for quite a while, and he&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>give you the calculus to do it. And until then, it&rsquo;s hopeless. So you might be better off to work</p>
<p>on the aqueduct or to focus upon sails or something. So if I look at this today, I say,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s massive, profound civilization advances to be made through digital transformation of</p>
<p>information. And you can see them like that. This is the story of today. This is not the story of</p>
<p>today, right? It&rsquo;s 10 years old, what we&rsquo;ve been seeing. We&rsquo;re living through different manifestations</p>
<p>of that story today, too, though. Like social media, the effects of that is very interesting</p>
<p>because ideas spread even, you talk about velocity of money, the velocity of ideas keeps increasing.</p>
<p>So like Wikipedia is a passive store. It&rsquo;s a store of knowledge. Twitter is like a water hose</p>
<p>or something. It&rsquo;s like spraying you with knowledge, whether you want it or not. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>social media is just like this explosion of ideas. And then we pick them up, and then we</p>
<p>pick them up. And then we try to understand ourselves because the drama of it also plays</p>
<p>with our human psyche. So sometimes there&rsquo;s more ability for misinformation, for propaganda to take</p>
<p>hold. So we get to learn about ourselves. We get to learn about the technology that can decelerate</p>
<p>the propaganda, for example, all that kind of stuff. But like the reality is we&rsquo;re living,</p>
<p>I feel like we&rsquo;re living through a singularity in the digital information space. And we&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have a great understanding of exactly how it&rsquo;s transforming our lives.</p>
<p>This is where money is useful as a metaphor for significance, because if money is the economic</p>
<p>energy of the civilization, then something that&rsquo;s extraordinarily lucrative that&rsquo;s going to generate</p>
<p>a monetary or a wealth increase is a way to increase the net energy in the civilization.</p>
<p>And ultimately, if we had 10 times as much of everything, we&rsquo;d have a lot more</p>
<p>free resources to pursue all of our advanced scientific and mathematical and theoretical</p>
<p>endeavors. So let&rsquo;s take Twitter. Twitter is something that could be 10 times more</p>
<p>valuable than it is. Twitter could be made 10 times better.</p>
<p>No, by the way, I should say that people should follow you on Twitter. Your Twitter</p>
<p>account is awesome. Thank you. It could be made 10 times better. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. Twitter can be made 10 times better. If we take YouTube or take education,</p>
<p>we could generate a billion PhDs. And the question is, do you need any profound</p>
<p>breakthrough in materials or technology to do that? And the answer is not really.</p>
<p>So if you want to, you could make Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Twitter, all these things</p>
<p>better. The United States government, if they took 1% of the money they spend on the Department</p>
<p>of Education and they simply poured it into digital education and they gave degrees to</p>
<p>people that actually met those requirements, they could provide 100x as much education for</p>
<p>one one hundredth of the cost and they could do it with no new technology. That&rsquo;s a marketing</p>
<p>and political challenge. So I don&rsquo;t think every objective is equally practical.</p>
<p>And I think the benefit of being an engineer or thinking about practical achievements is</p>
<p>when the government pursues an impractical objective or when anybody, an entrepreneur,</p>
<p>not so bad with entrepreneur because they don&rsquo;t have that much money to waste,</p>
<p>when a government pursues an impractical objective, they squander trillions and trillions</p>
<p>of dollars and achieve nothing. Whereas if they pursue a practical objective or if they simply</p>
<p>get out of the way and do nothing and they allow the free market to pursue the practical objectives,</p>
<p>then I think you can have a profound impact on the human civilization.</p>
<p>And if I look at the world we&rsquo;re in today, I think that there are multi trillion, 10, 20,</p>
<p>50 trillion dollars worth of opportunities in the digital information realm yet to be obtained.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s hundreds of trillions of dollars of opportunities in the digital energy realm</p>
<p>that not only are they not obtained, the majority of people don&rsquo;t even know what digital energy is.</p>
<p>Most of them would reject the concept. They&rsquo;re not looking for it. They&rsquo;re not expecting to find it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s inconceivable because it is a paradigm shift. But in fact, it&rsquo;s completely practical.</p>
<p>Right under our nose, it&rsquo;s staring at us and it could make the entire civilization</p>
<p>work dramatically better in every respect.</p>
<p>So you mentioned in the digital world, digital information is one, digital energy is two,</p>
<p>and the possible impact on the world and the set of opportunities available in the digital energy</p>
<p>space is much greater. So how do you think about digital energy? What is it?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll start with Tesla. He had a very famous quote. He said, if you want to understand the</p>
<p>universe, think in terms of energy, vibration, and frequency. And it gets you thinking about</p>
<p>what is the universe? And of course, the universe is just all energy. And then what is matter?</p>
<p>Matter is low frequency energy. And what are we? You know, we&rsquo;re vibrating, you know, ashes to ashes,</p>
<p>dust to dust. I can turn a tree into light. I can turn light back into a tree. If I consider</p>
<p>the entire universe, and it&rsquo;s very important because we don&rsquo;t really think this way. Let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>take the New York disco model. If I walk into a nightclub and there&rsquo;s loud music blaring in</p>
<p>New York City, what&rsquo;s really going on there, right? If you blast out 15, 14 billion years ago,</p>
<p>the universe is formed. Okay, that&rsquo;s a low frequency thing. The universe formed a billion</p>
<p>years ago, the sun, maybe the earth, or form. The continents are 400 million years old. The schist</p>
<p>that New York City is on is some hundreds of millions of years. But the Hudson River is only</p>
<p>20,000 years. There&rsquo;s a building that&rsquo;s probably 50 years old. There&rsquo;s a company operating that</p>
<p>disco or that club, which is five to 10 years old. There&rsquo;s a person, a customer walking in there</p>
<p>for an experience for a few hours. There&rsquo;s music that&rsquo;s oscillating at some kilohertz. And then</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s light. And you have all forms of energy, all frequencies, all layered, all moving through</p>
<p>different medium. And how you perceive the world is the question of at what frequency do you want</p>
<p>to perceive the world. And I think that once you start to think that way, you&rsquo;re catalyzed to think</p>
<p>about what would digital energy look like? And why would I want it? And what is it? So</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we just start right there? What is it? The most famous manifestation of digital energy</p>
<p>is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a crypto asset. It&rsquo;s a crypto asset that has monetary value.</p>
<p>Can we just link on that? Bitcoin is a digital asset that has monetary value.</p>
<p>What is a digital asset? What is monetary? Why use those terms versus the words of</p>
<p>money and currency? Is there something interesting in that disambiguation of different terms?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d call it a crypto asset network. The goal is to create a billion dollar block of pure energy</p>
<p>in cyberspace. One that I could then move with no friction at the speed of light.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the equivalent to putting a million pounds in orbit. How do I actually launch</p>
<p>something into orbit? How do I launch something into cyberspace such that it moves friction free?</p>
<p>And the solution is a decentralized proof of work network. Satoshi&rsquo;s solution was,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to establish a protocol running on a distributed set of computers that will maintain</p>
<p>a constant supply of never more than 21 million Bitcoin subdividable by 100 million Satoshis each.</p>
<p>Transferable via transferring private keys. Now, the innovation is to create that in an ethical,</p>
<p>durable fashion. The ethical innovation is I want it to be property and not a security.</p>
<p>A bushel of corn, an acre of land, a stack of lumber and a bar of gold and a Bitcoin are all</p>
<p>property. And that means they&rsquo;re all commonly occurring elements in the world. You could call</p>
<p>them commodities, but commodity is a little bit misleading and I&rsquo;ll tell you why in a second.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re all distinguished by the fact that no one entity or person or government controls them.</p>
<p>If you have a barrel of oil and you&rsquo;re in Ukraine versus Russia versus Saudi Arabia versus the U.S.,</p>
<p>you have a barrel of oil. And it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the premier in Japan or the mayor of Miami</p>
<p>Beach thinks about your barrel of oil. They cannot wave their hand and make it not a barrel of oil</p>
<p>or a cord of wood, right? And so property is just a naturally occurring element in the universe,</p>
<p>right? Why use the word ethical? Sorry to, I may interrupt occasionally. Why ethical assigned</p>
<p>to property? Because if it&rsquo;s a security, a security would be an example of a share of a stock</p>
<p>or a crypto token controlled by a small team. And in the event that something is a security because</p>
<p>some small group or some identifiable group can control its nature, character, or supply,</p>
<p>then it really only becomes ethical to promote it or sell it pursuant to fair disclosures.</p>
<p>So I give you maybe practical example. I&rsquo;m the mayor of Chicago. I give a speech. My speech,</p>
<p>I say, I think everybody in Chicago should own their own farm and have chicken, a chicken in the</p>
<p>backyard and their own horse and an automobile. That&rsquo;s ethical. I give the same speech and I say,</p>
<p>I think everybody in Chicago should buy Twitter stock, sell their house, or sell their house,</p>
<p>or sell their cash and buy Twitter stock. Is that ethical? Not really. But at that point,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve entered into a conflict of interest because what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re promoting</p>
<p>an asset which is substantially controlled by a small group of people, the board of directors or</p>
<p>the CEO of the company. So how would you feel if the president of the United States said,</p>
<p>I really think Americans should all buy Apple stock, especially if you work to Google.</p>
<p>But you worked anywhere. You&rsquo;d be like, why isn&rsquo;t he saying buy mine? Right? A security is a</p>
<p>proprietary asset in some way, shape, or form. And the whole nature of securities law, it starts from</p>
<p>this ancient idea, thou shalt not lie, cheat, or steal. Okay? So if I&rsquo;m going to sell you securities</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m going to promote securities as a public figure or as an influencer or anybody else,</p>
<p>if I create my own yo yo coin or Mikey coin, and then there&rsquo;s a million of them, and I tell you</p>
<p>that I think that it&rsquo;s a really good thing, and Mikey coin will go up forever, right? And everybody</p>
<p>buys Mikey coin, and then I give 10 million to you and don&rsquo;t tell the public, right? I&rsquo;ve cheated</p>
<p>them. Maybe if I have Mikey coin, and I think there&rsquo;s only 2 million Mikey coin, and I swear</p>
<p>to you, there&rsquo;s only 2 million, and then I get married, and I have three kids, and my third kid</p>
<p>is in the hospital, and my kid&rsquo;s going to die, and I have this ethical reason to print 500,000</p>
<p>more Mikey coin or else people are going to die, and everybody tells me it&rsquo;s fine. You know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve still abused, you know, the investor, right? It&rsquo;s an ethical challenge. If you look at ethics</p>
<p>laws everywhere in the world, they all boil down to having a clause which says that if you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>public figure, you can&rsquo;t endorse a security. You can&rsquo;t endorse something that would cause you to</p>
<p>have a conflict of interest. So if you&rsquo;re a mayor, a governor, a country, a public figure, an</p>
<p>influencer, and you want to promote or promulgate or support something using any public influence</p>
<p>or funds or resources you may have, it needs to be property. It can&rsquo;t be security. So it goes</p>
<p>beyond that, right? I mean, like would the Chinese want to support an American company, right? As</p>
<p>soon as you look at what&rsquo;s in the best interest of the human race, the civilization, you realize</p>
<p>that if you want an ethical path forward, it needs to be based on common property, which is fair.</p>
<p>And the way you get to a common property is through an open permissionless protocol. If it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not open, right, if it&rsquo;s proprietary, and I know what the code says, and you don&rsquo;t know what the</p>
<p>code says, that makes it a security. If it&rsquo;s permissioned, if you&rsquo;re not allowed on my network,</p>
<p>or if you can be censored or booted off my network, that also makes it a security.</p>
<p>So when I talk about property, I mean, the challenge here is how do I create something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s equivalent to a barrel of oil in cyberspace? And that means it has to be a nonsovereign bearer</p>
<p>instrument, open, permissionless, not censorable, right? If I could do that, then I could deliver</p>
<p>you 10,000 dematerialized barrels of oil, and you would take settlement of them, and you would know</p>
<p>that you have possession of that property, irregardless of the opinion of any politician</p>
<p>or any company or anybody else in the world. That&rsquo;s a really critical characteristic. And</p>
<p>it actually is, it&rsquo;s probably one of the fundamental things that makes Bitcoin special.</p>
<p>Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t just a crypto asset network. It&rsquo;s easy to create a crypto asset network.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to create an ethical crypto asset network, because you have to create one</p>
<p>without any government or corporation or investor exercising in due influence to make it successful.</p>
<p>So open, permissionless, noncensorable. So basically no way for you without explicitly</p>
<p>saying so, outsourcing control to somebody else. So it&rsquo;s a kind of, you have full control.</p>
<p>Even with a barrel of oil, what&rsquo;s the difference between a barrel of oil and a Bitcoin to you?</p>
<p>Because you kind of mentioned that both are property. You mentioned Russia and China and</p>
<p>so on. Is it the ability of the government to confiscate? In the end, governments can</p>
<p>probably confiscate no matter what the asset is, but you want to lessen the effort involved.</p>
<p>A barrel of oil is a bucket of physical property, liquid property, and Bitcoin is a digital property.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s easier to confiscate a barrel of oil.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier to confiscate things in the real world than things in cyberspace. Much easier.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not universally true. Some things in the digital space are actually easier to</p>
<p>confiscate because just the nature of how things move easily with information, right?</p>
<p>So I think in the Bitcoin world, what we would say is that Bitcoin is the most difficult</p>
<p>property that the human race possesses or has yet invented to confiscate. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>by virtue of the fact that you could take possession of it via your private keys.</p>
<p>So if you got your 12 seed phrases in your head, then that would be the highest form of property,</p>
<p>right? Because I literally have to crack your head open and read your mind to take it.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean I couldn&rsquo;t extract it from you under duress, but it means that it&rsquo;s harder than</p>
<p>every other thing you might own. In fact, it&rsquo;s exponentially harder. If you consider every other</p>
<p>thing you might own, a car, a house, a share of stock, gold, diamonds, property rights,</p>
<p>intellectual property rights, movie rights, music rights, anything imaginable, they would all be</p>
<p>easier by orders and orders of magnitude to seize. So digital property in the form of a</p>
<p>set of private keys is by far the apex property of the human race.</p>
<p>In terms of ethics, I want to make one more point. I might say to you, Lex, I think Bitcoin is the</p>
<p>best, most secure, most durable crypto asset network in the world. It&rsquo;s going to go up forever,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s nothing better in the world. I might be right. I might be wrong.</p>
<p>But the point is, because it&rsquo;s property, it&rsquo;s ethical for me to say that if I were to turn</p>
<p>around and say, you know, Lex, I think the same about microstrategy stock, MSTR. That&rsquo;s a security.</p>
<p>Okay? If I&rsquo;m wrong about that, I have civil liability or other liability because I could go</p>
<p>to a board meeting tomorrow and I could actually propose we issue a million more shares of</p>
<p>microstrategy stock, whereas the thing that makes Bitcoin ethical for me to even promote is the</p>
<p>knowledge that I can&rsquo;t change it. If I knew that I could make it 42 million instead of 21 million</p>
<p>and I had the button back here, right, then I have a different degree of ethical responsibility.</p>
<p>Now, I could tell you your life will be better if you buy Bitcoin, and it might not. You might go</p>
<p>buy Bitcoin, you might lose the keys and be bankrupt and your life ends and your life is not</p>
<p>better because you bought Bitcoin, right? But it wouldn&rsquo;t be my ethical liability any more than if</p>
<p>I were to say, Lex, I think you ought to get a farm. I think you should be a farmer. I think a</p>
<p>chicken in every pot, you should get a horse. I think you&rsquo;d be better. I mean, these are all</p>
<p>opinions expressed about property, which may or may not be right, that you may or may not agree with,</p>
<p>but in a legal sense, if we read the law, if we understand securities law, and I would say,</p>
<p>you know, most people in the crypto industry, you know, they didn&rsquo;t take companies public,</p>
<p>and so they&rsquo;re not really focused on the securities law. They don&rsquo;t even know the securities law.</p>
<p>If you focus on the securities law, that would say you just can&rsquo;t legally sell this stuff to</p>
<p>the general public or promote it without a full set of continuing disclosures signed off on by</p>
<p>a regulator. So there&rsquo;s a fairly bright line there with regard to securities. But when you get to the</p>
<p>secondary issue, it&rsquo;s how do you actually build a world based on digital property if public figures</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t embrace it or endorse it? You see, so you&rsquo;re not going to build a better world based upon</p>
<p>Twitter stock, if that&rsquo;s your idea of property, because Twitter stock is a security and Twitter</p>
<p>stock is never going to be a non sovereign bearer instrument in Russia, right, or in China, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even legal in China, right? So it&rsquo;s not a global permissionless open thing. It will never</p>
<p>be trusted by the rest of the world. And legally, it&rsquo;s impractical. But, you know, would you really</p>
<p>want to put $100 trillion worth of economic value on Twitter stock if there&rsquo;s a board of directors</p>
<p>and a CEO that could just get up and like take half of it tomorrow? The answer is no. So if you</p>
<p>want to build a better world based on digital energy, you need to start with constructing a</p>
<p>digital property. And I&rsquo;m using property here and open permissionless in a legal sense. Okay,</p>
<p>but I would also go to the next step and say property is low frequency money. So if you if I</p>
<p>give you a million dollars, and you want to hold it for a decade, you might go buy a house with it.</p>
<p>Right. And the house is low frequency money, you converted the the million dollars of economic</p>
<p>energy into a structure called a house. Maybe an after a decade, you might convert it back into</p>
<p>energy, you might sell the house for currency. And it&rsquo;ll be more worth more or less depending</p>
<p>upon the monetary climate. The frequency means what here? How quickly it changes state? How</p>
<p>quickly does something vibrate? So if I transfer $10 from me to you for a drink, and then you turn</p>
<p>around, you buy another right, we&rsquo;re vibrating on a frequency of every few hours, right? The energy</p>
<p>is changing hands. But it&rsquo;s not likely that you sell and buy houses every few hours. Right? The</p>
<p>frequency of a transaction in real estate is every 10 years, every five years, it&rsquo;s a much lower</p>
<p>frequency transaction. And so when you think about what&rsquo;s going on here, you have extremely low</p>
<p>frequency things, which we&rsquo;ll call property, then you have mid frequency things, I&rsquo;m going to call</p>
<p>them money or currency. And then you have high frequency, that&rsquo;s energy. And that&rsquo;s why I use</p>
<p>the illustration of you got the building, you got the light, and you got the sound, and they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>just energy moving at different frequencies. Now, Bitcoin is magical. And it is truly the innovation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a singularity, because it represents the first time in the history of human race</p>
<p>that we managed to create a digital property, properly understood. It&rsquo;s easy to create something</p>
<p>digital, right? Every coupon and every scan on Fortnite and Roblox and Apple TV credits and all</p>
<p>these things, they&rsquo;re all digital something, but they&rsquo;re securities. And that&rsquo;s why I use the</p>
<p>word something, but they&rsquo;re securities, right? Shares of stock are securities. Whenever anybody</p>
<p>transfers, when you transfer money on PayPal or Apple Pay, you&rsquo;re transferring in essence a</p>
<p>security or an IOU. And so transferring a bearer instrument with final settlement in the internet</p>
<p>domain or in cyberspace, that&rsquo;s a critical thing. And anybody in the crypto world can do that.</p>
<p>All the crypto is going to do that. But what they can&rsquo;t do, what 99% of them fail to do,</p>
<p>is be property. They&rsquo;re securities, correct? Well, there&rsquo;s a line there I&rsquo;d like to explore</p>
<p>a little further. For example, what about when you, like Coinbase or something like that,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s an exchange that you buy Bitcoin in, you start to move away from this kind of,</p>
<p>some of the aspects that you said makes up a property, which is this</p>
<p>noncensorable and permissionless and open. So in order to achieve the convenience,</p>
<p>the effectiveness of the transfer of energy, you have to leverage some of these places that remove</p>
<p>the aspects of property. So maybe you can comment on that. Let me give you a good model for that.</p>
<p>If you think about the layer one of Bitcoin, the layer one is the property settlement layer,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to do 350,000 transactions or less a day, 100 million transactions a year is</p>
<p>the bandwidth on the layer one. And it would be an ideal layer one to move a billion dollars from</p>
<p>point A to point B with the massive security. The role of the layer one is two things.</p>
<p>One thing is I want to move a large sum of money through space with security. I can move</p>
<p>any amount of Bitcoin in a matter of minutes for dollars on layer one. The second important</p>
<p>feature of the layer one is I need the money to last forever. I need the money indestructible,</p>
<p>immortal. So the bigger trick is not to move a billion dollars from here to Tokyo. The big trick</p>
<p>is to move a billion dollars from here to the year 2140. And that&rsquo;s what we want to solve with</p>
<p>layer one. And the best real metaphor in New York City would be the granite or the schist.</p>
<p>What you want is a city block of bedrock. And how long has it been there? Like millions of years</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been there. And how fast do you want it to move? You don&rsquo;t. In fact, the single thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>most important is that it not deflect. If it deflects a foot in 100 years, it&rsquo;s too much.</p>
<p>If it deflects an inch in 100 years, you might not want that. So the layer one of Bitcoin is</p>
<p>a foundation upon which you put weight. How much weight can you put on it? You put a trillion,</p>
<p>10 trillion, 100 trillion, a quadrillion? How much weight&rsquo;s on the bedrock in Manhattan, right?</p>
<p>Think about 100 story buildings. So the real key there is the foundational asset needs to be there</p>
<p>at all. So the fact that you can create a hundred trillion dollar layer one that would stand for</p>
<p>100 years, that is the revolutionary breakthrough first time. And the fact that it&rsquo;s ethical,</p>
<p>right? It&rsquo;s ethical and it&rsquo;s common property, global, permissionless. Extremely unlikely that</p>
<p>would happen. People tried 50 times before and they all failed. They tried 15,000 times after,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve all generally failed. 98% have failed and a couple have been less successful. But</p>
<p>for the most part, that&rsquo;s an extraordinary thing. Now,</p>
<p>just really quickly pause just to define some terms. If people don&rsquo;t know, layer one is that</p>
<p>Michael&rsquo;s referring to is in general what people know of as the Bitcoin technology originally</p>
<p>defined, which is the blockchain. There&rsquo;s a consensus mechanism of proof of work,</p>
<p>low number of transactions, but you can move a very large amount of money. The reason he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>using the term layer one is now that there&rsquo;s a lot of ideas of layer two technologies built on top</p>
<p>of this bedrock that allow you to move a much larger number of transactions,</p>
<p>sort of higher frequency. I don&rsquo;t know what terminology you want to use, but basically be</p>
<p>able to use now something that is based on Bitcoin to then buy stuff, be a consumer,</p>
<p>to transfer money, to use it as currency, just to define some terms.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the layer one is the foundation for the entire cyber economy, and we don&rsquo;t want it to move</p>
<p>fast. What we want is immortality, immortal, incorruptible, indestructible, right? That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what you want, integrity from the layer one. Now there&rsquo;s layer two and layer three, and layer</p>
<p>two I would define as an open, permissionless, noncustodial protocol that uses the underlying</p>
<p>layer one token as its gas fee. So what&rsquo;s custodial mean and how does the different markets,</p>
<p>like is lightning network? So lightning network would be an example of a layer two, noncustodial.</p>
<p>So the lightning network will sit on top of layer one, it&rsquo;ll sit on top of Bitcoin,</p>
<p>and it solves the, what you want to do is solve the problem of it&rsquo;s well and fine, I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to move a billion dollars every day, what I want to move is five dollars a billion times a day.</p>
<p>So if I want to move five dollars a billion times a day, I don&rsquo;t really need to put the entire</p>
<p>trillion dollars of assets at risk every time I move five dollars. All I really need to do is put</p>
<p>a hundred thousand dollars in a channel or a million dollars in a channel, and then I do</p>
<p>ten million transactions where I have a million dollars at risk. And of course it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>simple, if I put, if I lower my security requirement by a factor of a million,</p>
<p>I could probably move the stuff a million times faster, right? And that&rsquo;s how lightning works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s noncustodial because there&rsquo;s no corporation or custodian or counterparty you&rsquo;re trusting,</p>
<p>right? There&rsquo;s the risk of moving through the channel. But lightning is an example of how I go</p>
<p>from 350,000 transactions a day to 350 million transactions a day. So on that layer too, you</p>
<p>could move the Bitcoin in seconds for fractions of pennies. Now that&rsquo;s not the end all be all,</p>
<p>because the truth is there are a lot of open protocols. Lightning probably won&rsquo;t be the only</p>
<p>one. You know, there&rsquo;s an open market competition of other permissionless open source protocols to</p>
<p>do this work. And in theory, any other crypto network that was deemed to be property, deemed to</p>
<p>be non a security, you could also think of as potentially a layer two to Bitcoin, right? There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a debate about are there any and what are they, and we can leave that for a little bit of a</p>
<p>debate about are there any and what are they, and we can leave that for a later time.</p>
<p>But why do you think of them as layer two, as opposed to contending for layer one?</p>
<p>Yeah, actually, if they&rsquo;re using their own token, then they are a layer one. If you create an open</p>
<p>protocol that uses the Bitcoin token as the fee, then it becomes a layer two, right? Bitcoin itself,</p>
<p>right, incentivizes his own transactions with its own token, and that&rsquo;s what makes it layer one.</p>
<p>Okay, what&rsquo;s layer three, then?</p>
<p>Layer three is a custodial layer. So if you want to move Bitcoin in milliseconds for free,</p>
<p>you move it through Binance or Coinbase or Cash App. So this is a very straightforward thing. I</p>
<p>mean, it seems pretty obvious when you think about it that there are going to be hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>of layer threes. There may be dozens of layer twos. I mean, Lightning is a one, but it&rsquo;s not the only</p>
<p>one. Anybody can invent something, right? And we can have this debate about custodial, noncustodial.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think there&rsquo;s a monopolization possibilities at layer three?</p>
<p>So, you know, Coin, you mentioned Binance, Coinbase. What if they start to dominate,</p>
<p>and basically everybody&rsquo;s using them, practically speaking, and then it becomes too costly to</p>
<p>memorize the private key in your brain? I mean, or like the cold storage of layer one technology.</p>
<p>The idealists fear the layer threes because they think, and especially they detest,</p>
<p>they would detest it. There&rsquo;s almost like a layer four, by the way, if you want to.</p>
<p>A layer four would be, I&rsquo;ve got Bitcoin on an application, but I can&rsquo;t withdraw it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve got an application that&rsquo;s backed by Bitcoin, but the Bitcoin is sealed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a proprietary example. And I&rsquo;ll give you an example of that. That would be like</p>
<p>Grayscale. If I own a share of GBTC, and so I own a security, actually, you know, you could own MSTR.</p>
<p>If you own a security or you own a product that has Bitcoin embedded in it, you get the benefits</p>
<p>of Bitcoin, but you don&rsquo;t have the ability to withdraw the asset.</p>
<p>To get out of the security market at layer four? Am I understanding this correctly?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I would say, I don&rsquo;t, not all securities are layer four, but anything that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a proprietary product based upon what with Bitcoin embedded in it, where you can&rsquo;t withdraw the</p>
<p>Bitcoin is another application of Bitcoin. So if you think about different ways you can use this,</p>
<p>you can either stay completely on the layer one and use the base chain for your transactions,</p>
<p>or you can limit yourself to layer one and layer two lightning. And the purist would say we stay</p>
<p>there, get your Bitcoin off the exchange. But you could also go to the layer three.</p>
<p>When Cash App supported Bitcoin, they made it very easy to buy it, and then they gave you the</p>
<p>ability to withdraw. When PayPal or I think Robinhood let you buy it, they wouldn&rsquo;t let</p>
<p>you withdraw it, and there was a big community uproar, and people wanted to withdraw.</p>
<p>They want these layer threes to make it possible to withdraw the Bitcoin so you can take it to</p>
<p>your own private wallet and get it off the exchange. I think the answer to the question</p>
<p>of, well, is corruption possible? Corruption is possible in all human institutions and all</p>
<p>governments everywhere. The difference between digital property and physical property is when</p>
<p>you own a building in Los Angeles and the city politics turn against you, you can&rsquo;t move the</p>
<p>building. And when you own a share of a security that&rsquo;s like a U.S. traded security and you wish</p>
<p>to move to some other country, you can&rsquo;t take the security with you either. And when you own</p>
<p>a bunch of gold and you try to get through the airport, they might not let you take it.</p>
<p>So Bitcoin is advantageous versus all those because you actually do have the option to</p>
<p>withdraw your asset from the exchange. And if you had Bitcoin with Fidelity and you had shares of</p>
<p>stock with Fidelity, and if you had bonds and sovereign debt with Fidelity, and if you own some</p>
<p>mutual funds and some other random limited partnerships with Fidelity, none of those things</p>
<p>can be removed from the custodian. But the Bitcoin, you can take off the exchange, you can remove</p>
<p>from the custodian. So there&rsquo;s a deterrent that&rsquo;s an anti corrupting element. And the phrase is an</p>
<p>armed society is a polite society, right? Because you have the optionality to withdraw all your</p>
<p>assets from the crypto exchange, you can enforce fairness. And at the point where you disagree</p>
<p>with their policies, you can within an hour, move your assets to another counterparty or take</p>
<p>personal custody of those assets. And you don&rsquo;t have that option to withdraw all your assets.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t have that option with most other forms of property. Maybe you don&rsquo;t have as much</p>
<p>optionality with any other form of property on Earth. And so what makes digital property distinct</p>
<p>is the fact that it has the most optionality for custody. Now coming back to this digital energy</p>
<p>issue, the real key point is the energy moves in milliseconds for free on layer threes. It moves in</p>
<p>seconds or less than seconds on layer twos, it moves in minutes on the layer one. And I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it makes any sense to even think about trying to solve all three problems on the layer one</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s impossible to achieve the security and the incorruptibility and immortality if you</p>
<p>try to build that much speed and that functionality and performance. In fact, if you come back to the</p>
<p>New York model, you really wanted a block of granite, a building and a company. That&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>makes the economy, right? If I said to you, you&rsquo;re going to build a building, but you can only have</p>
<p>one company in it for the life of the building, it would be very fragile, like very brittle. What</p>
<p>company a hundred years ago is still relevant today? You want all three layers because they</p>
<p>all oscillate at different frequencies. And there&rsquo;s a tendency to think, well, it&rsquo;s got to be</p>
<p>this L1 or that L1, not really. And sometimes people think, well, I don&rsquo;t really want any L3.</p>
<p>But companies, it&rsquo;s not an even or, companies are better than crypto asset networks at certain</p>
<p>things. If you want complexity, you want to implement complexity, or you want to implement</p>
<p>compliance or customer service, right? Companies do these things well, right? You couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>decentralize Apple or Netflix or even YouTube. The performance wouldn&rsquo;t be there and the subtlety</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be there. And you can&rsquo;t really legally decentralize certain forms of banking and insurance</p>
<p>because they will become illegal in the political jurisdiction they&rsquo;re in. So, unless you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>crypto anarchist and you believe in no companies and no nation states, right? Which is just not</p>
<p>very practical, not anytime soon. Once you allow that nation states will continue and companies</p>
<p>have a role, then the layered architecture follows and the free market determines who wins.</p>
<p>For example, there are layer threes that let you acquire Bitcoin and withdraw Bitcoin.</p>
<p>There are other applications that let you acquire but not withdraw it. And they don&rsquo;t get the same</p>
<p>market share, but they might give you some other advantage. There are certain layer threes like</p>
<p>Jack Dorsey&rsquo;s Cash App, where they just incorporated lightning, an implementation of it.</p>
<p>So, that makes it more, that makes it advantageous versus an application that doesn&rsquo;t incorporate</p>
<p>lightning. If you think about the big picture, the big picture is 8 billion people with mobile phones</p>
<p>served by 100 million companies doing billions of transactions an hour. And the companies are</p>
<p>settling with each other on the base layer in blocks of 80 million at a time. And then the</p>
<p>companies are trading with the consumers, right, in proprietary layers, like layer three. And then</p>
<p>on occasion, people are shuffling assets across custodians with lightning layer two,</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t want to pay $5 to move $50. You want to pay a 20th of a penny.</p>
<p>You want to pay a 20th of a penny to move $50. And so, all of these things create efficiency</p>
<p>in the economy. And, Lex, if you want to consider how much efficiency, if you gave me a billion</p>
<p>dollars in 20 years, I couldn&rsquo;t find a way to trade with another company or a counterparty in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Like, no amount of money. Give me $10 billion. I couldn&rsquo;t do it because you get shut down at</p>
<p>the banking level. You can&rsquo;t link up a bank in Nigeria with a bank in the US. You get shut down</p>
<p>at this credit card level because they don&rsquo;t have the credit card, so they won&rsquo;t clear.</p>
<p>You would get shut down at the compliance FCPA level because, you know, you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to</p>
<p>implement a system that interfaced with somebody else&rsquo;s system if it&rsquo;s not in the right political</p>
<p>jurisdiction. On the other hand, three entrepreneurs in Nigeria on the weekend could</p>
<p>create a website that would trade in this lightning economy using open protocols without asking</p>
<p>anybody&rsquo;s permission. So, you&rsquo;re talking about something that&rsquo;s, like, a million times cheaper,</p>
<p>less friction, and faster to do it if you want to get money to move.</p>
<p>What do you think that looks like so that now there&rsquo;s a war going on in Ukraine,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other wars, Yemen, going out throughout the world in this most difficult of states that</p>
<p>a nation can be in, which is a war, a civil war, or war with other nations? What&rsquo;s the role of</p>
<p>Bitcoin in this context? I mean, Bitcoin&rsquo;s a universal trust protocol, right? A universal</p>
<p>energy protocol, if you will. English is one, okay? What I see is a bunch of fragmentation</p>
<p>of applications. For example, you know, the Russian payment app is not going to work in</p>
<p>Ukraine. The Ukraine payment app is not going to work in Russia. You know, US payment apps won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work either of those places, as far as I know. So, you know, and in Argentina, their payment</p>
<p>app may not work in certain parts of Africa. So, what you have is different local economies</p>
<p>where people spin up their own applications compliant with their own local laws, or,</p>
<p>you know, in war zones, not compliant, but just spinning up, you know?</p>
<p>So, how do you build something that&rsquo;s not compliant? What is the revolutionary act here</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t agree with the government or what you want to free yourself from the constitution?</p>
<p>So, here&rsquo;s the thing. When a nation is really at war, especially if it&rsquo;s an authoritarian regime,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to try to control the pop, like lock everything down, the spread of information.</p>
<p>How do you break through that? Do you do the thing that you mentioned, which is you have to build</p>
<p>another app, essentially, that allows the flow of money outside the legal constraints placed on you</p>
<p>by the government? So, basically, break the law? Is that possible?</p>
<p>Metaphorically speaking, if you want to break out of the constraints of your culture,</p>
<p>you learn to speak English. For example, it&rsquo;s not illegal to speak English, or even if it is,</p>
<p>right? It doesn&rsquo;t matter, but English works everywhere in the world if you can speak it,</p>
<p>and then you can tap into a global commerce and intelligence network. So, Bitcoin is a language,</p>
<p>so you learn to speak Bitcoin, or you learn to speak Lightning, and then you tap into that network</p>
<p>in, you know, whatever manner you can. But the problem is it&rsquo;s still very difficult</p>
<p>to move Bitcoin around in Russia and Ukraine now, during the war. And there was a sense to me that</p>
<p>the cryptocurrency in general could be the savior for helping people. There&rsquo;s millions of refugees</p>
<p>that are moving all around. It&rsquo;s very difficult to move money around in that space to help people.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re very early. Like, we&rsquo;re very embryonic here. If you look at the&hellip;</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s we, sorry? We as a human civilization, or we operating in the cryptocurrency space?</p>
<p>I think the entire crypto economy is very embryonic, and the human race&rsquo;s adoption of it</p>
<p>is embryonic. We&rsquo;re like one, two percent down that adoption curve. If you take Lightning,</p>
<p>for example, you know, the first real commercial applications of Lightning are just in the last</p>
<p>12 months. So we&rsquo;re like year one. We might be approaching year two of commercial Lightning</p>
<p>adoption. And if you look at Lightning adoption, Lightning&rsquo;s not built into Coinbase, it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>built into Binance, it&rsquo;s not built into FTX. Cash App just implemented the first implementation,</p>
<p>but not all the features are built into it. There&rsquo;s a few dozen, a dozen Lightning wallets</p>
<p>circulating out there. So I think that, you know, we&rsquo;re probably going to be 36 months of</p>
<p>software development. At the point that every Android phone and every iPhone has a Bitcoin</p>
<p>wallet or a crypto wallet in it of sorts, that&rsquo;s a big deal. If Apple embraced Lightning,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a big deal. So the adoption is the thing, like in a war zone adoption, the people who</p>
<p>struggle the most in war are people who weren&rsquo;t doing that great before the war started. They</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the technological sophistication. The hackers and all those kinds of people will find</p>
<p>a way. It&rsquo;s just regular people who are just struggling to make day by day living. And so</p>
<p>if the adoption permeates the entire culture, then you can start to move money around in the</p>
<p>digital space. If you can psychoanalyze Jack Dorsey for a second. So he&rsquo;s one of the early</p>
<p>adopters, or he&rsquo;s one of the people pushing the early adoption, this layer three, so inside Cash</p>
<p>App. What do you make of the man of this decision as a business owner, as somebody playing in the</p>
<p>space? Like what, why did he do it? And what does that mean for others at this scale that might be</p>
<p>doing the same? So incorporating Lightning networking, incorporating Bitcoin into their</p>
<p>products. I think he&rsquo;s been pretty clear about this. He feels that Bitcoin is an instrument of</p>
<p>economic empowerment for billions of people that are unbanked and have no property rights</p>
<p>in the world. If you want to give an incorruptible bank</p>
<p>to eight billion people on the planet, that&rsquo;s the same as asking the question,</p>
<p>how do you give a full education through PhD to eight billion people on the planet? And the answer</p>
<p>is a digital version of the 20th century thing running on a mobile phone. And Bitcoin is a bank</p>
<p>in cyberspace. It&rsquo;s run by incorruptible software and it&rsquo;s for everybody on earth.</p>
<p>So I think when Jack looks at it, he&rsquo;s very sensitive to the plight of everybody in Africa.</p>
<p>If you look at Africans, you&rsquo;re going to give them banks, you&rsquo;re not going to put a bank branch on</p>
<p>every corner. That&rsquo;s an obscene waste of energy. You&rsquo;re not going to run copper wires across the</p>
<p>continent. That&rsquo;s an obscene waste of energy. You&rsquo;re not going to give them gold. So how are</p>
<p>you going to provide people with a decent life? The metaphor I think is relevant here,</p>
<p>the biological metaphor, Lex, is a type one diabetic. If you&rsquo;re a type one diabetic,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t form fat. And if you can&rsquo;t form fat, then you can&rsquo;t store excess energy. So</p>
<p>that means that, I mean, fat is the ultimate organic battery. And if you&rsquo;ve got 30 pounds of it,</p>
<p>you can go 60 days without eating. But if you can&rsquo;t generate insulin, you can&rsquo;t form fat cells.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t form fat cells and store energy, then you can eat yourself to death.</p>
<p>I mean, you will eat and you will die. You&rsquo;ll starve to death. So the lack of property rights</p>
<p>is like being a type one diabetic. And so if you look at most people everywhere in the world,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have property rights, they don&rsquo;t have effective bank, and their currency is broken.</p>
<p>Like what are the two things that in theory would serve as the equivalent of a</p>
<p>organic battery or an economic battery to civilization? It would be, I have a currency</p>
<p>which holds its value and I can store it in a bank. So a risk free currency derivative.</p>
<p>I pay you your money, you take your life savings, you put it in a bank, you save up for your</p>
<p>retirement, you&rsquo;ll have happily ever after. That&rsquo;s the American dream.</p>
<p>Right? That&rsquo;s the idyllic situation. The real situation is there are no banks,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get a bank account. So I give you your pay in currency, and then I double the supply and</p>
<p>I give it to my cousin, or I give it to whatever cause I want, or I use it to buy weapons. And then</p>
<p>you find a loaf of bread cost triple next month is what it costs. And your life savings is worthless.</p>
<p>And so in that environment, everybody&rsquo;s ripped back to Stone Age barter. And the problem with</p>
<p>that even Stone Age barter is you&rsquo;re going to carry your life savings on your back. And what</p>
<p>happens when the guy with a machine gun points it at your head and just takes your life savings.</p>
<p>So I think from Jack&rsquo;s point of view, he thinks that life is, this is maybe too strong, but these</p>
<p>are my words, life is hopeless. It&rsquo;s hopeless. It&rsquo;s hopeless. It&rsquo;s hopeless. It&rsquo;s hopeless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hopeless for a lot of people. And Bitcoin is hope. Right? Because it gives everyone</p>
<p>an engineered monetary asset that&rsquo;s a bearer instrument. And it gives them a bank on their</p>
<p>mobile phone. And they don&rsquo;t have to trust their government or another counterparty</p>
<p>with their life force. So there&rsquo;s a secondary thing I think he&rsquo;s interested in, which is the</p>
<p>first thing is the human rights issue. And the second thing would be the friction to trade cross</p>
<p>borders is so great. Right? Like, you know, you like AI. So I&rsquo;ll give you a beautiful notion.</p>
<p>Maybe one day there&rsquo;ll be an artificially intelligent creature in cyberspace that is</p>
<p>self sufficient and rich. Like that, we would have sovereignty. Can a robot own money or property?</p>
<p>How about kind of Tesla car? Can I actually put enough money in a car for it to drive itself and</p>
<p>maintain itself forever? Or can I create an artificially intelligent creature in cyberspace</p>
<p>that is endowed such that it would live a thousand years and continue to do its job?</p>
<p>Right? You know, we have a word for that in the real world is institution, Harvard, Cambridge,</p>
<p>Stanford, right? There are institutions with endowments that go on in perpetuity.</p>
<p>But what if I wanted to perpetuate a software program? And with something like digital property</p>
<p>with Bitcoin and lightning, you could do it. And on the other hand, with banks and credit cards,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t, right? You couldn&rsquo;t ever. So, so you can create things that are beautiful and lasting.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the difference in speed? Well, so I can either trade with everybody in the world</p>
<p>at the speed of light, friction free in 24 hours writing a Python script, or I can spend $100 billion</p>
<p>to trade with a few million people in the world after it takes them six months of application.</p>
<p>The impedance is like a 10 million to one difference, right? And the metaphors are</p>
<p>literally like launching something in orbit versus almost orbit or vacuum sealing something.</p>
<p>Does it last forever and does it orbit forever or does it go away?</p>
<p>Does it last forever and does it orbit forever or does it go up and come down and burn up?</p>
<p>Right. And I think Jack is interested in, you know, putting freedom in orbit. All right.</p>
<p>Putting freedom.</p>
<p>Putting freedom in orbit. And he said it many times. He said,</p>
<p>this is the internet needs a native currency. Right. And no political construct or security</p>
<p>can be a native currency. You need a property and you need a property that can be moved a million</p>
<p>times a second. Can you oscillate it at 10 kilohertz or a hundred kilohertz? And the answer</p>
<p>is only if it&rsquo;s a pure digital construct, permissionless and open. And so I think</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s enthusiastic as the technologist and he&rsquo;s enthusiastic as the humanitarian.</p>
<p>And what he&rsquo;s doing is support both those areas. He&rsquo;s supporting the Bitcoin and the lightning</p>
<p>protocol by building them into his products, but he&rsquo;s also building the applications,</p>
<p>which you need at the cash app level in order to commercialize and deliver the functionality</p>
<p>and the compliance necessary and they&rsquo;re related.</p>
<p>And I should also say he&rsquo;s just a fascinating person. I, for a random reason that</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t even explain. If I tried, I met him a few days ago and gave him a great big hug in the</p>
<p>middle of nowhere. There was no explanation. He just appeared. That&rsquo;s a fascinating human,</p>
<p>his relationship with art, with the world, with human suffering, with technology is fascinating.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what his path looks like, but it&rsquo;s interesting that people like that exist.</p>
<p>And in part, I&rsquo;m saddened that he no longer is involved with Twitter directly as a CEO,</p>
<p>because I was hoping something inside Twitter would also integrate some of these ideas of what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re calling digital energy to see how social networks, something I&rsquo;m really interested in and</p>
<p>passionate about could be transformed. Let me ask you just for educational purposes,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the, can you please explain to me what web three and the beef between Jack and Mark</p>
<p>Andreessen is exactly? Did you see what happened? Sorry to have you analyze Twitter like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Shakespeare, but can you please explain to me why, why there was any, any drama over this topic?</p>
<p>First of all, web three is a term that&rsquo;s used to refer to, you know,</p>
<p>the part of the economy that&rsquo;s token financed. So if I&rsquo;m launching an application and my idea</p>
<p>is to create a token along with the application and issue the token to the community so as to</p>
<p>finance the application and build support for it, I think that that&rsquo;s the most common</p>
<p>interpretation of web three. There are other interpretations too. So I&rsquo;m just going to refer</p>
<p>to that one. And I think the beef in a nutshell, not articulated, but I&rsquo;ll articulate it is whether</p>
<p>or not you should focus all your energy creating applications on top of an ethical digital property</p>
<p>like Bitcoin, or whether you should attempt to create a competitor to it, which generally would</p>
<p>be deemed as a security by the Bitcoin community. So I&rsquo;m going to put on my Bitcoin hat here. Yeah.</p>
<p>Right. All the tokens that are, if it&rsquo;s driven by a venture capitalist, well, it&rsquo;s a security.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a CEO and a CTO, it&rsquo;s a security. All these projects, they&rsquo;re companies. Foundations</p>
<p>are companies, right? If you call them a project or a foundation, it doesn&rsquo;t make it not a security.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all, in essence, collections of individuals that are issuing equity in the form of a token.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s a pre mine, an IPO, an ICO, a foundation, or any kind of protocol where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a group of engineers that have influence over it, then that&rsquo;s a security.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a group of engineers that have influence over it, then to a securities lawyer, or to most</p>
<p>Bitcoiners and definitely to anybody that&rsquo;s steeped in securities law, you&rsquo;re looking to say,</p>
<p>well, that passes the Howey test. It looks like a security. It should be sold to the public pursuant</p>
<p>to disclosures and regulations. And you&rsquo;re just ducking the IPO process, right? And so now we get</p>
<p>back to the ethical issue. The ethical issue is if you&rsquo;re trading it as a commodity and representing</p>
<p>it as a commodity, while truthfully it&rsquo;s a security, then it&rsquo;s a violation of ethics rules,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s probably illegal. Well, you keep leaning on this. Let me push back on that part. Maybe you</p>
<p>hit me, but you keep leaning on this line of securities law as if it would all do respect to</p>
<p>lawyers, as if that line somehow defines what is and isn&rsquo;t ethical. I think there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>correlation as you&rsquo;ve discussed, but I&rsquo;d like to leave the line aside. If the law calls something</p>
<p>as a security, it doesn&rsquo;t mean in my eyes that it is unethical. I mean, there could be some</p>
<p>technicalities and lawyers and people play games with this kind of stuff all the time. But I take</p>
<p>your bigger point that if there&rsquo;s a CEO, if there&rsquo;s a project lead, that&rsquo;s fundamentally,</p>
<p>well, that to you is fundamentally different than the structure of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that creating securities is unethical. I created security. I took a company public,</p>
<p>right? That&rsquo;s not the unethical part. It&rsquo;s completely ethical to create securities.</p>
<p>A block is a security. All companies are securities. The unethical part is to</p>
<p>represent it as property when it&rsquo;s a security and to promote it or trade it as such.</p>
<p>This whole promotion, that&rsquo;s also a technical thing because what counts and not as promotion</p>
<p>is a legal thing and you get in trouble for all these things, but that&rsquo;s the game that lawyers</p>
<p>play. There&rsquo;s an ethical thing here, which is what&rsquo;s right to promote and not. To me, propaganda is</p>
<p>unethical, but it&rsquo;s usually not illegal. If you roll the clock back 20 years,</p>
<p>all the boiler room pump and dump schemes were all about someone pitching a penny stock,</p>
<p>selling Swampland in Florida. And if you roll the clock back forward 20 years and I create my own</p>
<p>company and I represent it as the same thing and I don&rsquo;t make the disclosures, you&rsquo;re just one step</p>
<p>removed from the boiler room scheme and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s distasteful about it. There are ways to</p>
<p>sell securities to the public, but there are expectations. Maybe we could forget about whether</p>
<p>the security laws are ethical or not. I will leave that alone. We&rsquo;ll just start with the biblical</p>
<p>definition of ethics. Don&rsquo;t lie, cheat, or steal. So if I&rsquo;m going to sell something to you, I need</p>
<p>to fully disclose what I&rsquo;m selling to you, right? And that&rsquo;s a matter of great debate right now.</p>
<p>And so I think that that&rsquo;s part of the debate. But the other part of the debate is</p>
<p>whether or not we need more than one token. We need at least one, right? We need at least one</p>
<p>digital property because zero means there is no digital economy. And by the way, the conventional</p>
<p>view of maximalists is they think there&rsquo;s only one and everything else isn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s not the point</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to make. I would say we know that there is at least one digital property.</p>
<p>And that is Bitcoin. If you can create a truly decentralized, noncustodial, bearer instrument</p>
<p>that is not under the control of any organization that is fairly distributed, then you might create</p>
<p>another or multiple. And there may be others out there. But I think that</p>
<p>the frustration of a lot of people in the Bitcoin community, and I share this with Jack, is we could</p>
<p>create $100 trillion of value in the real world simply by building applications on top of Bitcoin</p>
<p>as a foundation. And so continually trying to reinvent the wheel and create competitive things</p>
<p>is a massive waste of time and it&rsquo;s diversion of human creativity. It&rsquo;s like we have an ethical good</p>
<p>thing. And now we&rsquo;re going to try to create a third or a fourth one. Why?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s talk about it. So first of all, I&rsquo;m with you. But let me ask you this interesting</p>
<p>question because we talked about properties and securities, and we talked about how you</p>
<p>have a popular Twitter account. It&rsquo;s hilarious and insightful. You do promote Bitcoin, in a sense.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you would say that. But do you think there&rsquo;s a conflict of interest in anyone</p>
<p>who owns Bitcoin promoting Bitcoin? Is it the same as you promoting the first Bitcoin?</p>
<p>I would say no, there&rsquo;s an interest. I think that you can promote a property or an idea to the extent</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t control it. I think that the point at which you start to have a conflict of interest</p>
<p>is that you don&rsquo;t control it. I think that the point at which you start to have a conflict of</p>
<p>interest is when you&rsquo;re promoting a proprietary product or a proprietary security. A security,</p>
<p>in general, is a proprietary asset. So for example, if you look at my Twitter, you will find</p>
<p>that I make lots of statements about Bitcoin. You won&rsquo;t ever see me making a statement that,</p>
<p>say, MicroStrategy stock will go up forever. I&rsquo;m not promoting a security MSTR because at the end</p>
<p>of the day, MSTR is a security. It is proprietary. I have proprietary interest in it. I have</p>
<p>a disproportionate amount of control and influence on the direction.</p>
<p>The control is the problem. The control is the problem. Because you have interest in both.</p>
<p>If Bitcoin is as successful as we&rsquo;re talking about, you very possibly can become the richest</p>
<p>human on earth, given how much you own in Bitcoin, right? The wealthiest, not the richest. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what those words mean.</p>
<p>I would benefit economically.</p>
<p>You would benefit economically.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>So the reason that&rsquo;s not conflict of interest is because the word property, that Bitcoin is an idea</p>
<p>and Bitcoin is open.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t own it. I don&rsquo;t control it. In essence, the ethical line here is,</p>
<p>could I print myself 10 million more Bitcoin or not, right?</p>
<p>Or can anyone, right? It&rsquo;s not just you. Can anyone? Because can you promote somebody else&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>Yes, I guess you can. Like, can you promote Apple when you have no stake?</p>
<p>You could have a Twitter account where you promote oil or you promote camping or you promote</p>
<p>family values or promote, you know, a carnivore diet or promote the Iron Man, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to get wealthier if you promote camping because you can&rsquo;t own a stake. I mean,</p>
<p>you own a lot of Bitcoin. What is that? Don&rsquo;t you own the stake in the idea?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would grant you that.</p>
<p>But the lack of control is the fundamental ethical line that you just, you don&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>all you are is you&rsquo;re a fan of the idea. You believe in the idea and the power of the idea.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t take that idea away from others.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s come back to, let me give you some maybe easier examples. If you were the head of the</p>
<p>Marine Corps, right? And someone came to you and said, I created MarineCoin. And the twist on</p>
<p>MarineCoin is I want you to tell every Marine that they&rsquo;ll get an extra MarineCoin when they</p>
<p>get their next stripe. And then I&rsquo;m going to let you buy MarineCoin now. And then after you buy</p>
<p>MarineCoin, I want you to promote it to them, right? At some point, if you start to have a</p>
<p>disproportional influence on it, or if you&rsquo;re in a conversation with people with disproportionate</p>
<p>influence becomes conflict of interest, and it would make you profoundly uncomfortable, I think,</p>
<p>if the head of the Marine Corps started promoting anything that looked like a security.</p>
<p>Now, if the head of the Marine Corps started promoting canoeing, you might think he&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of wacky, like maybe, like that&rsquo;s kind of a waste of time and distraction. So, but to the extent</p>
<p>that canoeing is not a security, not a problem, unless you, you know, ultimately, the issue of</p>
<p>decentralization is really a critical one. So not having a head. So is it something,</p>
<p>can Bitcoin be replicated? So the, all the things that you&rsquo;re saying that make it a property,</p>
<p>can that be replicated? Have any other&hellip;</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s possible to create other crypto properties.</p>
<p>Does it, does the having a head, like of a project, a thing that limits its ability to be a</p>
<p>property, if you try to replicate a project? Is that the fundamental flaw?</p>
<p>No, I, look, I think the real fundamental issue is you just never want it to change.</p>
<p>Like, like, if you really want something decentralized, you want a genetic template</p>
<p>that substantially is not going to change for a thousand years. So I think Satoshi said it at one</p>
<p>point, he said the nature of the software is such that by version 0.1, its genetic code was set.</p>
<p>If, if there was any development team that&rsquo;s continually changing it, you know, on a routine</p>
<p>basis, it becomes harder and harder to maintain its decentralization because now, now there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>issue of who&rsquo;s influencing the changes. So what you really want is, is a very, very simple idea,</p>
<p>right? The simplest idea, I&rsquo;m just going to keep track of who owns 21 million parts of energy.</p>
<p>And when someone proposes big functional upgrades, you almost don&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t really want that</p>
<p>development to go on the base layer. You want that development to go on the layer threes, because</p>
<p>now, cache app has a proprietary set of functionality and it&rsquo;s a security.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re going to promote the use of this thing, you&rsquo;re not going to, you&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>promote the layer three security because that&rsquo;s a, an edge to a given entity and you&rsquo;re trusting</p>
<p>the counterparty, you&rsquo;re going to promote the layer one or at most the layer two.</p>
<p>Okay. So one of the fascinating things about Bitcoin, and sorry to romanticize certain notions,</p>
<p>but Satoshi Nakamoto, that the founder is anonymous. Maybe you can speak a little bit</p>
<p>about that. Maybe you can speak to whether that&rsquo;s useful, but also I just like the psychology of</p>
<p>that to imagine that there&rsquo;s a human being that was able to create something special and walk away.</p>
<p>So first are you Satoshi Nakamoto?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain I&rsquo;m not. No, actually I, you know, I think the providence is really important. And</p>
<p>if I were to look at the highlighted points, I think having a founder that was anonymous</p>
<p>or should anonymous is important. I think the founder disappearing is also important. I think</p>
<p>that the fact that the Satoshi coins never moved is also important. I think the lack of an initial</p>
<p>coin offering is also important. I think the lack of a corporate sponsor is important. I think the</p>
<p>fact that it traded for 15 months with no commercial value was also important. I think that</p>
<p>the simplicity of the protocol is very important. I think that the outcome of the block size wars</p>
<p>is very important. And all of those things add up to common property. They&rsquo;re all indicia,</p>
<p>indicators of a digital property as opposed to security. If there was a Satoshi sitting around,</p>
<p>sitting on top of $50 billion worth of Bitcoin, I don&rsquo;t think it would</p>
<p>cripple Bitcoin as property, but I think it would undermine its digital property.</p>
<p>And if I wanted to undermine a crypto asset network, I would do the opposite of all those</p>
<p>things. I would launch one myself, I would sell 25% or 50% of the general public, I would keep some</p>
<p>of the initial, I would pre mine some stuff or early mine it, you know, and I would keep an</p>
<p>influence on it. Those are all the opposite of what you would do in order to create common property.</p>
<p>And so I see the entire story as Satoshi giving a gift of digital property to the human race</p>
<p>and disappearing.</p>
<p>Do you think it was one person? Do you have ideas of who it could be?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care to speculate.</p>
<p>But do you think it was one person?</p>
<p>It was one person, maybe in conjunction with a bunch of others. I mean, it might have been a</p>
<p>group of people that were working together, but certainly there&rsquo;s a Satoshi.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just so fascinating to me that one person could be so brave and thoughtful. Or do you</p>
<p>think a lot of his accent, like the block size wars, the decision to make a block a certain size,</p>
<p>all the things you mentioned led up to the characteristics that make Bitcoin property.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s an accident? Or it was deeply thought through? Like how does this is almost like</p>
<p>a history of science question.</p>
<p>They tried 40 of them, right? I mean, I think there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a history of attempting to</p>
<p>create something like this. And it was tried many, many times and, and they failed for different</p>
<p>reasons. And I think that it&rsquo;s like Prometheus tried to start a fire 47 times and maybe the 48th</p>
<p>time it sparked. And that&rsquo;s how I see this. This is the first one that sparked. And it sets a</p>
<p>roadmap for us. And I think if you&rsquo;re looking for any one word that characterizes it, it&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>The whole point of the network is it&rsquo;s a fair launch, a fair distribution. Like, yeah, I have</p>
<p>Bitcoin, but I bought it. In fact, I, you know, at this point, we&rsquo;ve paid $4 billion of you real</p>
<p>cash to buy it. If I was sitting on the same position, and I had it for free, then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always this question of, did I, you know, or I bought it for a nickel, a coin or a penny, a coin.</p>
<p>The question is, was it fair? And that&rsquo;s a very hard question to answer, right? Did you acquire</p>
<p>the Bitcoin that you own fairly? And if you roll the clock back, you know, you could have bought it</p>
<p>for a nickel or a dime, but that was when it was a million times more likely to fail, right? When</p>
<p>the risk was greater, the cost was lower. And then over time, the risk became lower and the cost</p>
<p>became greater. And the real critical thing was to allow the marketplace, absent any powerful</p>
<p>interested actor, right? It&rsquo;s almost like if Satoshi had held a million coins and then stayed</p>
<p>engaged for 10 more years, tweaking things in the background, there&rsquo;d still be that question.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;ve got is really a beautiful thing. We&rsquo;ve got a chain reaction in cyberspace or an</p>
<p>ideology spreading virally in the world that has seasoned in a fair ethical fashion. Sometimes it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a very violent, brutal fashion with all the volatility, right? And there&rsquo;s been a lot of,</p>
<p>you know, a lot of sound and fury along the way.</p>
<p>How do you psychoanalyze? How do you deal from a financial, from a human perspective with the</p>
<p>volatility? You mentioned you could have gotten it for a nickel and the risk was great. Where&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>risk today? What&rsquo;s your sense?</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re 13 years into this entire activity. I think the risk has never been lower.</p>
<p>If you look at all the risks, right, the risks in the early years are, is the engineering protocol</p>
<p>proper? Like one megabyte block size, 10 minute clock frequency cryptography is first, will it be</p>
<p>hacked or will it crash? 730,000 blocks and it hasn&rsquo;t crashed. Will it be hacked? Hasn&rsquo;t been</p>
<p>hacked. But you know, it&rsquo;s a Lindy thing, right? You wait 13 years to see if it&rsquo;ll be hacked.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, with a billion dollars, it&rsquo;s not as interesting a target as it is with</p>
<p>a hundred billion. And when it gets to be worth a trillion, then it&rsquo;s a bigger target. So the</p>
<p>risk has been bleeding off over time as the network monetized. I think the second question is,</p>
<p>will it be banned? You couldn&rsquo;t know. It literally could have been banned at any time, many times</p>
<p>early on. In fact, in 2013, I tweeted on that subject. I thought it would be banned. I made a</p>
<p>very infamous tweet. I thought it was going to be banned. In 2014, the IRS designated it as</p>
<p>property and gave it property tax treatment, okay? So they could have given it a tax treatment where</p>
<p>you had to pay tax on the unrealized capital gains every year and it probably would have</p>
<p>crushed it to death, right? So it could have been in any number of places banned by a government.</p>
<p>But in fact, it was legitimized as property. And then the question is, would it be hacked</p>
<p>or would it be copied? Well, it&rsquo;d be something better than that. And it was copied 15,000 times.</p>
<p>And you know the story of all those. And they either diverged to be something totally different</p>
<p>and not comparable or someone trying to copy a non sovereign bearer instrument store of value</p>
<p>found that their networks crashed to be 1% of what Bitcoin is. So now we&rsquo;re sitting at a point where</p>
<p>all those risks are out of the way. I would say that year one of institutional adoption</p>
<p>is it started August 2020. That&rsquo;s when MicroStrategy bought $250 million worth of</p>
<p>Bitcoin and we put that on the wire. We were the first publicly traded company to actually buy</p>
<p>Bitcoin. I don&rsquo;t think you could have found a $5 million purchase from a public company</p>
<p>before we did that. So that was kind of like a gun going off. And then in the next 12 months,</p>
<p>Tesla bought Bitcoin, Square bought Bitcoin. And I&rsquo;d say now we&rsquo;re in year two of institutional</p>
<p>adoption. And there are about 24, should be 24 publicly traded Bitcoin miners by the end of this</p>
<p>quarter. So you&rsquo;re looking at 36 publicly traded companies. And you&rsquo;ve got 50, at least in the</p>
<p>range of $50 billion of Bitcoin on the balance sheet of publicly traded companies and hundreds</p>
<p>of billions of dollars of market cap of Bitcoin exposed companies. So I would say the asset,</p>
<p>decade one was entrepreneurial, experimental. Decade two is a rotation from entrepreneurs</p>
<p>institutions and is becoming institutionalized. So maybe decade one, you go from zero to a trillion</p>
<p>and a decade two, you go from one trillion to a hundred trillion.</p>
<p>Trey Lockerbie What about governments, government adoption,</p>
<p>institutional adoption? Are governments important in this? Maybe making it some governments</p>
<p>incorporating it into as a currency into their banks, all that kind of stuff. Is that important?</p>
<p>And if it is, when will it happen?</p>
<p>John Ligato It&rsquo;s not essential for the success of the asset</p>
<p>class, but I think it&rsquo;s inevitable in various degrees over time. But the most likely thing</p>
<p>to happen next is large acquisitions by institutional investors of Bitcoin as a digital</p>
<p>gold, where they&rsquo;re just swapping out gold for digital gold and thinking of it like that.</p>
<p>And the government entities most likely to be involved with that would be sovereign wealth</p>
<p>funds. If you look at all the sovereign wealth funds that are holding big tech stock, equities,</p>
<p>the Swiss, the Norwegians, the Middle Easterners, if you can hold big tech, then holding digital</p>
<p>gold would be not far removed from that. That&rsquo;s a noncontroversial adoption.</p>
<p>I think there are opportunities for governments that are much more profound. If a government</p>
<p>started to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, that&rsquo;s much bigger than just an asset</p>
<p>investment. That&rsquo;s 100x bigger. And you could imagine that&rsquo;s like a trillion dollar opportunity.</p>
<p>Like any government that wanted to adopt it as a treasury reserve asset would probably</p>
<p>generate trillions of dollars, a trillion or more of value. And then the thing that people</p>
<p>think about is, well, will oil ever be priced in Bitcoin or any other export commodity?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s like $1.8 trillion or more of export commodities in the world. And right now,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all priced in dollars. I think that this is a colorful thing, but not really that relevant.</p>
<p>Like you could sell all that stuff in dollars. The relevant decision that any institution makes,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re a nonprofit, a university, a corporation, or a government, is what&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>treasury reserve asset? And if your treasury reserve asset is the peso, and if the peso is</p>
<p>losing 20% or 30% of its value a year, then your balance sheet is collapsing within five years.</p>
<p>And if the treasury reserve asset is dollars and currency derivatives and US treasuries,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re getting your seven. Right now, it&rsquo;s probably 15% or more monetary inflation. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>running double the historic average. You could argue triple, somewhere between double and triple,</p>
<p>depending upon what your metric is. So do I think it&rsquo;ll happen? I think that they&rsquo;re conservative,</p>
<p>but they have to be shocked. And I think there is a shock. The late Russian sanctions are a big</p>
<p>shock. When the West sees $300 billion worth of Russian gold and currency derivatives, I think</p>
<p>you got the famous quote by Putin that we have to rethink our treasury strategies. And that pushes</p>
<p>everybody toward a commodity strategy. What commodities do I want to hold? I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got a lot of people thinking. I think it&rsquo;s got the Chinese thinking. Everybody wants to be the</p>
<p>reserve currency, right? So if I buy $50 billion worth of dollars every year, then I buy $500</p>
<p>billion over a decade, and I probably pay $250 billion of inflation cost on the backs of my</p>
<p>on the backs of my citizens in a decade. So inflation could be one of the sources of shock.</p>
<p>And you wonder if there is a switch to Bitcoin, whether it will be a bang or a whimper. Like,</p>
<p>what is the nature of the shock or the transition? I think that the year 2022 is pretty catalytic</p>
<p>for digital assets in general and for Bitcoin in particular. The Canadian trucker crisis,</p>
<p>I think, educated hundreds of millions of people and made them start questioning their property</p>
<p>rights and their banks. I think the Ukraine war was a second shock. But I think that the Russian</p>
<p>sanctions was a third shock. Yeah, I think all three of them. And I think hyperinflation in the</p>
<p>rest of the world is a fourth shock. And then persistent inflation in the US is a fifth shock.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a perfect storm. And if you put all these events together, what do they signify?</p>
<p>They signify the rational conclusion for any person thinking about this is, I&rsquo;m not sure if I</p>
<p>can trust my property. I don&rsquo;t know if I have property rights. I don&rsquo;t know if I can trust the</p>
<p>bank. And if I&rsquo;m politically at odds with the leader of my own country, I&rsquo;m going to lose my</p>
<p>property. And if I&rsquo;m politically at odds with the owner of another country, I&rsquo;m still going to lose</p>
<p>my property. And when push comes to shove, the banks will freeze my assets and seize them.</p>
<p>And I think that that is playing out in front of everybody in the world, such that your logical</p>
<p>response would be, I&rsquo;m going to convert my weak currency to a strong currency. Like I&rsquo;ll convert</p>
<p>my peso and lira to the dollar. I&rsquo;m going to convert my weak property to strong property.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to sell my building downtown Moscow. And I&rsquo;d rather own a building in New York City. I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>rather own in a powerful nation than be stuck with a building in Nigeria or a building in Argentina</p>
<p>or whatever. So I&rsquo;m going to sell my weak properties to buy strong properties. I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>convert my physical assets to digital assets. I&rsquo;d rather own a digital building than own a physical</p>
<p>building. Because if I had a billion dollar building in Moscow, who can I rent that to?</p>
<p>But if I have a billion dollar digital building, I can rent it to anybody in any city in the world,</p>
<p>anybody with money. And the maintenance cost is almost nothing. And I can hold it for 100 years.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an indestructible building. And then finally, I want to move from having my assets</p>
<p>in a bank with a counterparty to self custody assets. And this is not just Ukraine, but this is</p>
<p>like the story in Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, South America. You don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really want to be sitting with $10 million in a bank in Istanbul, the bank&rsquo;s going to freeze your</p>
<p>money converted to lira, devalue the lira and then feed it back to you over 17 years, right?</p>
<p>So self custody assets will be layer one Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Self custody assets, it&rsquo;s like, if I if I got my own hardware wallet, and I&rsquo;ve either got</p>
<p>your highest form of self custody would be Bitcoin on your own hardware wallet or Bitcoin</p>
<p>and your own self custody. And the other the other thing people think about is how do I get crypto</p>
<p>dollars like tether, like some stable coin? Yeah, like I&rsquo;d rather if you had a choice, would you</p>
<p>rather have your money in a bank in a warzone in dollars or have your money in a stable coin on</p>
<p>your mobile phone in dollars? Right? I mean, you take the latter risk rather than the former</p>
<p>warzone. Definitely. Yeah. And you can see that happening. Like we&rsquo;ve gone from 5 billion in</p>
<p>stable coins to 200 billion. Yeah. In the last 24 months. Yeah. So I do think there&rsquo;s massive demand</p>
<p>for crypto dollars in the form of a US dollar asset. And there&rsquo;s and everybody in the world</p>
<p>would say, Yeah, I want that. Well, unless you&rsquo;re just an extreme patriot, but most people in the</p>
<p>world would say I want that. And then a lesser group of people would say, I think I want to be</p>
<p>able to carry my property in the palm of my hand. So I have self custody of it. So the</p>
<p>Bitcoin price has gone through quite a roller coaster. What do you think is the high point</p>
<p>is going to hit? I think it&rsquo;ll go forever. Right? I mean, I think the Bitcoin is going to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to climb in a serpentine fashion, it&rsquo;s going to advance and come back and it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>keep, it&rsquo;s going to keep climbing. I think that the volatility attracts all the capital</p>
<p>into the marketplace. And so the volatility makes it the most interesting thing in the financial</p>
<p>universe. It also generates massive yield and massive returns for traders. And that attracts</p>
<p>capital. Like we&rsquo;re talking about the difference between 5% return and 500% return. So the fast</p>
<p>money is attracted by the volatility. The volatility has been decreasing year by year by</p>
<p>year. I think that it&rsquo;s stabilizing. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll see as much volatility in the future as we</p>
<p>have in the past. I think that if we look at Bitcoin and model it as digital gold, the market</p>
<p>cap goes to between 10 and 20 trillion. But gold is, remember, gold is defective property. Gold is</p>
<p>dead money. You have a billion dollars of gold that sits in a vault for a decade. It&rsquo;s very hard</p>
<p>to mortgage the gold. It&rsquo;s also very hard to rent the gold. You can&rsquo;t loan the gold. No one&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to create a business with your gold. So gold doesn&rsquo;t generate much of a yield. So for that</p>
<p>reason, most people wouldn&rsquo;t store a billion dollars for a decade in gold. They would buy a</p>
<p>billion dollars of commercial real estate property. And the reason why is because I can rent it and</p>
<p>generate a yield on it that&rsquo;s in excess of the maintenance cost. So if you consider digital</p>
<p>property, that&rsquo;s 100 to 200 trillion dollar addressable market. So I would think it goes from</p>
<p>10 trillion to 100 trillion as people start to think of it as digital property.</p>
<p>What does that mean in terms of price per coin?</p>
<p>At 500,000, that&rsquo;s a 10 trillion dollar asset. At 5 million, that&rsquo;s a 100 trillion dollar asset.</p>
<p>So I think it crosses a million. It can go even higher.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it keeps going up forever. I mean, there&rsquo;s no reason it couldn&rsquo;t go to 10 million</p>
<p>a coin, right? Because digital property isn&rsquo;t the highest form, right? Gold was that low frequency</p>
<p>money. Property is a mid frequency money. But when I start to program it faster, it starts to</p>
<p>look like digital energy. And then it doesn&rsquo;t just replace property, then you&rsquo;re starting to replace</p>
<p>bonds. It&rsquo;s 100 trillion in bonds, there&rsquo;s 50 to 100 trillion in other currency derivatives.</p>
<p>And these are all conventional use cases, right? I think that there&rsquo;s 350 trillion to 500 trillion</p>
<p>dollars worth of currency derivatives in the world. And when I say that, I mean things that</p>
<p>are valued based upon fiat cash flows, any commercial real estate, any bond, any sovereign</p>
<p>debt, any currency itself, any derivatives to those things, they&rsquo;re all derivatives,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all defective. And they&rsquo;re all defective because of this persistent 7% to 14%</p>
<p>lapse, which we call inflation or monetary expansion.</p>
<p>Can we switch subjects to talk about the energy side of it, like the innovative piece?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just start with this idea that I&rsquo;ve got a hotel worth a billion dollars with a thousand</p>
<p>rooms. When it becomes a dematerialized hotel.</p>
<p>I love that word so much, by the way, dematerialized hotel.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re crossing the fountain blow here. Imagine the fountain blow is dematerialized.</p>
<p>The problem with a physical hotel is it got to hire real people moving subject to the speed of</p>
<p>sound and physics laws and Newton&rsquo;s laws, and I can rent it to people in Miami Beach.</p>
<p>But if it was a digital hotel, I could rent the room to people in Paris, London, and New York</p>
<p>every night, and I can run it with robots. And as soon as I do that, I can rent it by the room hour,</p>
<p>and I can rent it by the room minute. And so I start to chop my hotel up into</p>
<p>a hundred thousand room hours that I sell to the highest bidder anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>And you can see all of a sudden the yield, the rent, and the income of the property</p>
<p>is dramatically increased. I can also see the maintenance cost of the property falls.</p>
<p>I get on Moore&rsquo;s Law, and I&rsquo;m operating in cyberspace. So I got rid of Newton&rsquo;s</p>
<p>laws. I got rid of all the friction and all those problems. I tapped into the benefits of cyberspace.</p>
<p>I created a global property. I started monetizing at different frequencies. And of course, now I can</p>
<p>mortgage it to anybody in the world. You&rsquo;re not going to be able to get a mortgage on a Turkish</p>
<p>building from someone in South Africa. You have to find someone that&rsquo;s local to the culture you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>So when you start to move from analog property to digital property, it&rsquo;s not just a little bit</p>
<p>better. It&rsquo;s a lot better. And what I just described, Lex, is like the DeFi vision, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the beauty of DeFi, flash loans, money moving at high velocity. At some point,</p>
<p>if the hotel is dematerialized, then what&rsquo;s the difference between renting a hotel room</p>
<p>and loaning a block of stock, right? I&rsquo;m just finding the highest best use of the thing.</p>
<p>It feels like the magic really emerges, though, when you build a market of layer two and layer</p>
<p>three technologies on top of that. It&rsquo;s like, maybe you can correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but for</p>
<p>all these hotels and all these kinds of ideas, it&rsquo;s always touching humans at some point. And</p>
<p>consumers or humans, business owners, and so on. So you have to create interface, you have to create</p>
<p>services that make all that super efficient, super fun to use, pleasant, effective, all those kinds</p>
<p>of things. So you have to build a whole economy on top of that. Yeah, and I happen to think that won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be done by the crypto industry at all. I think that&rsquo;ll be done by centralized applications.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;ll be the citadels of the world, the high speed traders of the world, the New Yorkers.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;ll be Binance, FTX, and Coinbase as a layer three exchange that will give you the yield</p>
<p>and will give you the loan and the best terms. Because ultimately, you have to jump these</p>
<p>compliance hoops. It comes like BlockFi can give you yield, but they have to do it in a compliant</p>
<p>way with the United States jurisdiction. So ultimately, those applications to use that digital</p>
<p>property and either generate a loan, give you a loan on it or give you yield on it are going to</p>
<p>come from companies. But the difference, the fundamental difference is it could be companies</p>
<p>anywhere in the world. So if a company in Singapore comes up with a better offering,</p>
<p>right, then the capital is going to start to flow to Singapore. I can&rsquo;t send 10 city blocks of</p>
<p>LA to Singapore to rent during a festival, but I can send 10 blocks of Bitcoin to Singapore.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got a truly global market that&rsquo;s functioning in this asset. And is there second</p>
<p>order asset? For example, maybe you&rsquo;re an American citizen and you own 10 Bitcoin and someone in</p>
<p>Singapore will generate 27% yield in the Bitcoin. But legally, you can&rsquo;t send the money to them or</p>
<p>the Bitcoin to them. It doesn&rsquo;t matter because the fact that that exists means that someone in Hong</p>
<p>Kong will borrow the 10 Bitcoin from somebody in New York, and then they will put on the trade</p>
<p>in Singapore. And that will create a demand for Bitcoin, which will drive up the market.</p>
<p>A demand for Bitcoin, which will drive up the price of Bitcoin, which will result in an effective</p>
<p>tax free yield for the person in the US that&rsquo;s not even in the jurisdiction.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s nothing that&rsquo;s going on in Singapore to drive up the price of your land in LA.</p>
<p>But there is something going on everywhere in the world to drive up the price of</p>
<p>property and cyberspace if there&rsquo;s only one digital Manhattan. And so there&rsquo;s a dynamic</p>
<p>there which is profound because it&rsquo;s global. But now let&rsquo;s go to the next extreme. I&rsquo;m still</p>
<p>giving you a fairly conventional idea, which is let&rsquo;s just loan the money fast on a global network</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s just rent the hotel room fast in cyberspace. But let&rsquo;s move to maybe a more</p>
<p>innovative idea. The first generation of internet brought a lot of productivity, but there&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>just a lot of flaws in it. For example, Twitter is full of garbage. Instagram DMs are full of</p>
<p>garbage. Your Twitter DMs are full of garbage. YouTube is full of scams. Every 15 minutes,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a Michael Saylor Bitcoin giveaway spun up on YouTube. My Office 365 inbox is full of garbage,</p>
<p>millions of spam messages. I&rsquo;m running four different email filters. My company spends</p>
<p>million dollars a year to fight denial of service attacks and all sorts of other</p>
<p>security things. There are denial of service attacks everywhere against everybody in cyberspace</p>
<p>all the time. It&rsquo;s extreme. And we&rsquo;re all beset with hostility. You&rsquo;ve been a victim of it in</p>
<p>Twitter. You go on Twitter and people post stuff they would never say to your face. And then if you</p>
<p>look, you find out that the account was created like three days ago and it&rsquo;s not even a real</p>
<p>person. So, you know, we&rsquo;re beset with phishing attacks and scams and spam bots and garbage.</p>
<p>And why? And the answer is because the first generation of internet was digital information</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no energy. There&rsquo;s no conservation of energy in cyberspace. The thing that makes</p>
<p>the universe work is conservation of energy. Like if I went to a hotel room, I&rsquo;d have to post a</p>
<p>credit card. And then if I smashed the place up, there&rsquo;d be economic consequences. Maybe there&rsquo;d</p>
<p>be criminal consequences. There might be reputational consequences. You know, a lamp</p>
<p>might fall on me. But in the worst case, I can only smash up one hotel room. Now, imagine I could</p>
<p>actually write a Python script to send myself to every hotel room in the world every minute,</p>
<p>not post a credit card and smash them all up anonymously. The thing that makes the universe</p>
<p>work is friction, speed of sound, speed of light, and the fact that it&rsquo;s ultimately it&rsquo;s conservative.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re either energy or your matter, but once you&rsquo;ve used the energy, it&rsquo;s gone and you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do infinite everything. That&rsquo;s missing in cyberspace right now. And if you look at all of</p>
<p>the moral hazards and all of the product defects that we have in all of these products, most of</p>
<p>them, 99% of them could be cured if we introduced conservation of energy into cyberspace. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you can do with high speed digital property, high speed Bitcoin. And by high speed,</p>
<p>I mean, not 20 transactions a day, I mean, 20,000 transactions a day. So how do you do that? Well,</p>
<p>I let everybody on Twitter post 1000 or 10,000 Satoshis via lightning wallet, a lightning badge,</p>
<p>give me an orange check. If you put up 20 bucks once in your life, you could give 300 million</p>
<p>people an orange check. Right now, you don&rsquo;t have a blue check, Lex. You&rsquo;re a famous person. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know why you don&rsquo;t have a blue check. Have you ever applied for a blue check? No. There are 360,000</p>
<p>people on Twitter with a blue check. There are 300 million people on Twitter. So the conventional</p>
<p>way to verify accounts is elitist archaic. Yeah, how does it work? How do you get a blue check?</p>
<p>You go to apply and wait six months and you have to post like three articles in the public</p>
<p>mainstream media that illustrates you&rsquo;re a person of interest. Generally, they would grant them to</p>
<p>CEOs of public companies. The whole idea is to verify that you are who you say you are.</p>
<p>But the question is, why isn&rsquo;t everybody verified? And there&rsquo;s a couple of threads on that. One is</p>
<p>some people don&rsquo;t want to be doxxed. They want to be anonymous. But there are even anonymous people</p>
<p>that should be verified. Because otherwise, you&rsquo;re subjecting their entire following to</p>
<p>phishing attacks and scams and hostility. But the other&hellip; What&rsquo;s the orange verification? So</p>
<p>this idea, can you actually elaborate a little bit more if you put up 20 bucks? Yeah, I think</p>
<p>everybody on Twitter ought to be able to get an orange check if they could come up with like $10.</p>
<p>And what is the power of that orange check? What does that verify exactly? You basically post a</p>
<p>security deposit for your safe passes through cyberspace. So the way it would work is if you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got $10 once in your life, you can basically show that you&rsquo;re credit worthy. And that&rsquo;s your pledge</p>
<p>to me that you&rsquo;re going to act responsibly. So you put the 10 or the $20 into the lightning wallet,</p>
<p>you get an orange check. Then Twitter just gives you a setting where I can say the only people that</p>
<p>could DM me are orange checks. The only people that can post on my tweets are orange checks.</p>
<p>So instead of locking out the public and just letting your followers comment, you lock out</p>
<p>all the unverified. And that means people that don&rsquo;t want to post $10 security deposit can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>comment. Once you&rsquo;ve done those two things, then you&rsquo;re in position to monetize malice,</p>
<p>monetize motion or malice for that matter. But let&rsquo;s just say for the sake of argument,</p>
<p>you post something and 9,700 bots spin up and pitch their whatever scam. Right now,</p>
<p>you sit and you go report, report, report, report, report, report. And if you spend an hour,</p>
<p>you get through half of them, you waste an hour of your life. They just spin up another 97</p>
<p>gazillion because they&rsquo;ve got a Python script spinning it up, so it&rsquo;s hopeless. But on the</p>
<p>other hand, if you report them, and they really are a bot, Twitter&rsquo;s got a method to actually</p>
<p>delete the account. They know that they&rsquo;re bots. The problem is not they don&rsquo;t know how to delete</p>
<p>the account. The problem is there are no consequences when they delete the account.</p>
<p>So if there are consequences, Twitter could give, they could just seize the $10 or seize the $20</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a bot. It&rsquo;s a malicious criminal act or whatever. It is a violation of the platform</p>
<p>rules. You end up seizing $10,000, give half the money to the reporter and half the money to the</p>
<p>Twitter platform. And&hellip; It&rsquo;s a really powerful idea, but that&rsquo;s tying it, that&rsquo;s adding friction</p>
<p>akin to the kind of friction you have in the physical world. You&rsquo;re tying, you have consequences,</p>
<p>you have real consequences.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s putting conservation of energy.</p>
<p>Conservation of energy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no friction, there&rsquo;s no nothing on this earth. Right? I mean, you can&rsquo;t walk across the</p>
<p>room without friction. Right? So friction is not bad, right? Unnecessary friction</p>
<p>is bad. So in this particular case, you&rsquo;re introducing conservation of energy. And in essence,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re introducing the concept of consequence or truth into cyberspace. And that means if you do</p>
<p>want to spend up 10 million fake less Freedmen&rsquo;s, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to cost you a hundred million dollars to spend up 10 million fake Lexus.</p>
<p>But the thing is you could do that with the dollar, but your case, you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s more tied to physical reality when you do that with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, let&rsquo;s follow up on that idea a bit more. If you did do it with the dollar,</p>
<p>then the question is how to 6 billion people deposit the dollars, right? Because what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing is, yeah, could you do it with a credit card? Like how do you send dollars? You have to</p>
<p>docks yourself. Like it&rsquo;s not easy. So you&rsquo;re talking about inputting a credit card transaction,</p>
<p>docksing yourself. And now you&rsquo;ve just eliminated the 2 billion people that don&rsquo;t have credit cards</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t have banks. You&rsquo;ve also got a problem with everybody that wants to remain anonymous,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve also got this other problem, which is credit. You know, credit cards are expensive</p>
<p>transactions, low frequency, slow settlement. So do you really want to pay two and a half percent</p>
<p>every time you actually show a $20 deposit? And maybe you could do a Kluge version of this for</p>
<p>a subset of people. It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s 10% as good if you did it with conventional payment rails.</p>
<p>But what you can&rsquo;t do is the next idea, which is I want the orange badge to be used to give</p>
<p>me safe passage through cyberspace, tripping across every platform. So how do I solve the</p>
<p>denial of service attacks against a website? I publish a website. You hit it with a million</p>
<p>requests. OK, now how do I deal with that? Well, I can lock you out and I can make it a zero trust</p>
<p>website and then you have to be coming at me through a trusted firewall with a trusted credential. But</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a pretty draconian thing. Or I could put it behind a lightning wall. A lightning wall</p>
<p>would be, you know, I just challenge you, Lex, you want to browse the web, you want to</p>
<p>show me your 100000 Satoshis. Do you have 100000 Satoshis? Click. OK, now you click away 100 times</p>
<p>or 1000 times. And after 1000 times, you know, well, now, Lex, you&rsquo;re getting offensive to take</p>
<p>a Satoshi from you or 10 Satoshis, a microtransaction. You want to hit me a million</p>
<p>times? I&rsquo;m taking all your Satoshis and locking you out. What you want to do is you want to go</p>
<p>through 200 websites a day. And what you want every time you cross a domain, you need to be</p>
<p>able to, in a split second, prove that you&rsquo;ve got some asset. And now when you cross back,</p>
<p>when you exit domain, you want to fetch your asset back. So how do I, in a friction free fashion,</p>
<p>browse through dozens or hundreds of websites, post a security deposit for state, state, state</p>
<p>passage, and then get it back? You couldn&rsquo;t afford to pay a credit card fee each time.</p>
<p>When you think about two and a half percent as a transaction fee, it means you trade the money</p>
<p>40 times and it&rsquo;s gone. Yeah, it&rsquo;s gone. Yeah. So you can&rsquo;t do this kind of hopping around through</p>
<p>the internet with this kind of verification that grounds you to physical reality. It&rsquo;s a really,</p>
<p>really interesting idea. Why hasn&rsquo;t that been done? I think you need two things. You need an</p>
<p>idea like a digital asset like Bitcoin that&rsquo;s a bearer instrument for final settlement. And then</p>
<p>you need a high speed transaction network like Lightning where the transaction cost might be a</p>
<p>20th of a penny or less. And if you roll the clock back 24 months, I don&rsquo;t think you had the Lightning</p>
<p>network in a stable point. It&rsquo;s really just the past 12 months. It&rsquo;s an idea you could think about</p>
<p>this year. And I think you need to be aware of Bitcoin as something other than like a scary</p>
<p>speculative asset. So I really think we&rsquo;re just the beginning. The embryonic stage. I have to ask</p>
<p>Michael Saylor, you said before, there&rsquo;s no second best to Bitcoin. What would be the second best?</p>
<p>Traditionally, there&rsquo;s Ethereum with smart contracts, Cardano with proof of stake,</p>
<p>Polkadot with interoperability between blockchains. Dogecoin has the incredible power of the meme.</p>
<p>Privacy with Monero. I just can keep going. There&rsquo;s of course, after the block size wars,</p>
<p>the different offshoots of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>I think if you decompose or segment the crypto market, you&rsquo;ve got crypto property.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is the king of that. And other Bitcoin forks that wanted to be a bearer instrument store</p>
<p>of value would be a property, a Bitcoin cash or Litecoin, something like that.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;ve got crypto currencies. I don&rsquo;t think Bitcoin is a currency because a currency I define</p>
<p>in nation states since a currency is a digital asset that you can transfer in a transaction</p>
<p>without incurring a taxable obligation. So that means it has to be a digital asset.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a taxable obligation. So that means it has to be a stable dollar or a stable euro or a stable</p>
<p>yen, a stable coin. So I think you&rsquo;ve got crypto currencies, Tether, Circle, most famous.</p>
<p>Then I think you&rsquo;ve got crypto platforms. And Ethereum is the most famous of the crypto platforms,</p>
<p>the platform upon which with smart contract functionality, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then I think you&rsquo;ve got just crypto securities. It&rsquo;s just like my favorite</p>
<p>or whatever meme coin. And I love it because I love it. And it&rsquo;s attached to my game or my</p>
<p>company or my persona or my whatever. I think if you push me and said, what&rsquo;s the second best?</p>
<p>I would say the world wants two things. It wants crypto property as a savings account,</p>
<p>and it wants cryptocurrency as a checking account. And that means that the most popular thing really</p>
<p>is going to be a stable coin dollar. Right. And there&rsquo;s a maybe a fight right now. It might be</p>
<p>Tether. Right. But a stable dollar, because I feel like the market opportunity, it&rsquo;s not clear that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be one that will win. The class of stable dollars is probably a one to ten trillion dollar</p>
<p>market easily. I think that in a crypto platform space, Ethereum will compete with Solana and</p>
<p>Binance Smart Chain and the like. Are there certain characteristics of any of them that</p>
<p>kind of stand out to you? Don&rsquo;t you think the competition is based on a set of features? Also,</p>
<p>the set of features that a cryptocurrency provides, but also the community that it provides.</p>
<p>Do you think the community matters in sort of the adoption, the dynamic of the adoption,</p>
<p>both across the developers and the investors? If I&rsquo;m looking at them, I mean, the first question is,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the regulatory risk? How likely is it to be deemed a property versus security?</p>
<p>And the second is, what&rsquo;s the competitive risk? And the third is, what&rsquo;s the speed and the</p>
<p>performance? And all those things lead to the question of what&rsquo;s the security risk?</p>
<p>How likely is it to crash and burn? And how stable or unstable is it? And then there&rsquo;s the marketing</p>
<p>risk. I mean, there are different teams behind each of these things and communities behind them.</p>
<p>I think that the big cloud looming over the crypto industry is regulatory treatment of</p>
<p>cryptocurrencies and regulatory treatment of crypto securities and crypto platforms. And I think that</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t be determined until the end of the first Biden administration. For example, there are</p>
<p>people that would like only US FDIC insured banks to issue cryptocurrencies. They want JP Morgan to</p>
<p>issue a crypto dollar backed one to one. But then in the US right now, we have Circle and we have</p>
<p>other companies that are licensed entities that are backed by cash and cash equivalents, but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not FDIC insured banks. There&rsquo;s also a debate in Congress about whether state chartered</p>
<p>banks should be able to issue these things. And then we have Tether and others that are outside</p>
<p>of the US jurisdiction. They&rsquo;re probably not backed by cash and cash equivalents. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>backed by stuff, and we don&rsquo;t know what stuff. And then finally, you have UST and DAI, which are</p>
<p>algorithmic stable coins that are even more innovative further outside the compliance</p>
<p>framework. So if you ask who&rsquo;s going to win, the question is really, I don&rsquo;t know, will the market</p>
<p>decide or will the regulators decide if the regulators get out of the way and the market</p>
<p>fall out? Well, then it&rsquo;s an interesting discussion. And then I think that all bets are off if the</p>
<p>regulators get more heavy handed with this. And I think you could have the same discussion with</p>
<p>crypto properties like the DeFi exchanges and the crypto exchanges. The SEC would like to regulate</p>
<p>the crypto exchanges. They&rsquo;d like to regulate the DeFi exchanges. That means they may regulate the</p>
<p>crypto platforms and at what rate and in what fashion. And so I think that I could give you</p>
<p>an opinion if it was limited to competition and the current regulatory regime. But I think that</p>
<p>the regulations are so fast moving and it&rsquo;s so uncertain that you can&rsquo;t make a decision</p>
<p>without considering the potential actions of the regulators.</p>
<p>I hope the regulators get out of the way. Can you steel me on the case that Dogecoin is,</p>
<p>I guess, the second best cryptocurrency if you don&rsquo;t consider Bitcoin a cryptocurrency,</p>
<p>Bitcoin a cryptocurrency, but instead a crypto property?</p>
<p>I would classify it as crypto property because the US dollar is a currency. So unless your</p>
<p>crypto asset is pegged algorithmically or stably to the value of the dollar is not a currency,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a property or it&rsquo;s an asset.</p>
<p>So then can you steel me on the case that Dogecoin is the best cryptocurrency then?</p>
<p>Because Bitcoin is not even in that list.</p>
<p>The debate is going to be whether it&rsquo;s property or security. And there&rsquo;s a debate whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>decentralized enough. So let&rsquo;s assume it was decentralized.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s increasing at not quite five, what, 5% a year inflation rate, but it&rsquo;s not 5%</p>
<p>exponentially. It&rsquo;s like a plus 5 million, 5% something captain is less. I forget the</p>
<p>exact number, but it&rsquo;s an inflationary property. It&rsquo;s got a lower inflation rate</p>
<p>than the US dollar. And it&rsquo;s got a much lower inflation rate than many other fiat currencies.</p>
<p>So I think you could say that.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you see the power of meme, the power of ideas, the power of fun or whatever mechanism</p>
<p>is used to captivate a community?</p>
<p>I do, but there are meme stocks. It doesn&rsquo;t absolve you of your ethical and securities</p>
<p>liabilities if you&rsquo;re promoting it. So I don&rsquo;t have a problem with people buying a stock.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the way I divide the world is there&rsquo;s investment, there&rsquo;s saving, and there&rsquo;s speculation</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s trading. So Bitcoin is an asset for saving. If you want to save money for</p>
<p>100 years, you don&rsquo;t really want to take on execution risk or the like. So you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>buying something to hold forever. For you to actually endorse something as a property,</p>
<p>like if you said to me, Mike, what should I buy for the next 100 years? I say, well,</p>
<p>some amount of real estate, some amount of scarce collectibles, some amount of Bitcoin,</p>
<p>right? You can run your company, right? But running your company is an investment. So</p>
<p>the savings are properties. If you said, what should I invest in? I&rsquo;d say, well, here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a list of good companies, private companies. You can start your own company. That&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>investment, right? If you said, what should I trade? Well, I&rsquo;m trading as like a proprietary</p>
<p>thing. I don&rsquo;t have any special insight into that. If you&rsquo;re a good trader, you know you</p>
<p>are. If you said to me, what should you speculate in? We talk about meme stocks and meme stocks</p>
<p>and meme coins, and it kind of sits up there. It sits right in the same space with what</p>
<p>horse should you bet on and what sports team should you gamble on and should you bet on</p>
<p>black six times in a row and double down each time. I mean, it&rsquo;s fun, but at the end of</p>
<p>the day, it&rsquo;s a speculation, right? You can&rsquo;t build a civilization on it. It&rsquo;s not an institutional</p>
<p>asset. And in fact, where I&rsquo;d leave it, right, is Bitcoin is clearly digital property, which</p>
<p>makes it an institutional grade investable asset for a public company, a public figure,</p>
<p>a public investor, or anybody that&rsquo;s risk adverse. I think that the top 100 other cryptos</p>
<p>are like venture capital investments. And if you&rsquo;re a VC and if you&rsquo;re a qualified technical</p>
<p>investor and you have a pool of capital and you can take that kind of risk, then you can</p>
<p>parse through that and form opinions. It&rsquo;s just orders of magnitude more risky because</p>
<p>of competition, because of ambition, and because of regulation. And if you take the meme coins,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like when some rapper comes out with a meme coin, it&rsquo;s like maybe it&rsquo;ll peak when</p>
<p>I hear about it, right? I mean, SHIB was created as the coin such that it had so many zeros</p>
<p>after the decimal point that when you looked at it on the exchanges, it always showed zero,</p>
<p>zero, zero, zero. And it wasn&rsquo;t until like six months after it got popular that they</p>
<p>started expanding the display so you could see whether the price had changed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s speculation. You&rsquo;ve been, maybe you can correct me, but you&rsquo;ve been critical of Elon</p>
<p>Musk in the past in the crypto space. Where do you stand on Elon&rsquo;s effect on Bitcoin and</p>
<p>cryptocurrency in general these days? I believe that Bitcoin is a massive breakthrough for the</p>
<p>human race that will cure half the problems in the world and generate hundreds of trillions of</p>
<p>dollars of economic value to the civilization. And I believe that it&rsquo;s in an early stage</p>
<p>where many people don&rsquo;t understand it, and they&rsquo;re afraid of it, and there&rsquo;s FUD,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s uncertainty, there&rsquo;s doubt, and there&rsquo;s fear, and there&rsquo;s a very noisy crypto</p>
<p>world. And there&rsquo;s 15,000 other cryptos that are seeking relevance. And I think most of the FUD</p>
<p>is actually fueled by the other crypto entrepreneurs. So the environmental FUD and</p>
<p>the other types of uncertainty that surround Bitcoin, generally they&rsquo;re not coming from</p>
<p>legitimate environmentalists. They don&rsquo;t come from legitimate critics. They actually are guerrilla</p>
<p>marketing campaigns that are being financed and fueled by other crypto entrepreneurs</p>
<p>because they have an interest in doing so. So if I look at the constructive path forward,</p>
<p>first, I think it&rsquo;d be very constructive for corporations to embrace Bitcoin and build</p>
<p>applications on top of it. You don&rsquo;t need to fix it. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with it, right? Like</p>
<p>when you put it on a layer two and a layer three, it moves a billion times a second at the speed of</p>
<p>light. So every beautiful, cool DeFi application, every crypto application, everything you could</p>
<p>imagine you might want to do, you can do with a legitimate company and a legitimate website or</p>
<p>mobile application sitting on top of Bitcoin or Lightning if you want to. So I think that</p>
<p>to the extent that people do that, that&rsquo;s going to be better for the world. If you consider what</p>
<p>holds people back, I think it&rsquo;s just misperceptions about what Bitcoin is. So I&rsquo;m a big fan of just</p>
<p>educating people. If you&rsquo;re not going to commercialize it, then just educate people on</p>
<p>what it is. So for example, Bitcoin is the most efficient use of energy in the world by far,</p>
<p>right? Most people don&rsquo;t necessarily perceive that or realize that. But if you were to take</p>
<p>any metric, energy intensity, you put like $2 billion worth of electricity in the network</p>
<p>every year and it&rsquo;s worth $850 billion. There is no industry in the real world, right, that is that</p>
<p>energy efficient. Not only that energy efficient, it&rsquo;s also the most sustainable industry. We do</p>
<p>surveys. 58% of Bitcoin mining energy is sustainable. So there&rsquo;s a very good story.</p>
<p>In fact, every other industry, planes, trains, automobiles, construction, food, medicine,</p>
<p>everything else is less clean, less efficient. So the basic debate was&hellip;</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say there is a debate. I would just say that to the extent that the Bitcoin community</p>
<p>had any issue with Elon, it was just this environmental uncertainty that he fueled</p>
<p>in a couple of his tweets, right? Which I think just is very distracting.</p>
<p>But that was one of them. But I think it&rsquo;s like the Bitcoin maximalists, but generally,</p>
<p>the crypto community, what you call the crypto entrepreneurs are&hellip; It&rsquo;s also&hellip; They&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>it for investment, for speculation, and therefore get very passionate about people&rsquo;s celebrities,</p>
<p>including you, like famous people, saying positive stuff about any one particular</p>
<p>crypto thing you can buy in Coinbase. And so they might be unhappy with Elon</p>
<p>Musk that he&rsquo;s promoting Bitcoin and then not, and then promoting Dogecoin, then not.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much emotion tied up in the communication on this topic.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s where a lot of the&hellip;</p>
<p>Look, I don&rsquo;t have a criticism of Elon Musk. He&rsquo;s free to do whatever he wishes to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s his&hellip; In fact, Elon Musk is the second largest supporter of Bitcoin in the world.</p>
<p>I think that the Bitcoin community tends to eat its own quite a bit. It tends to be very</p>
<p>self critical. And instead of saying, well, Elon is more supportive of Bitcoin</p>
<p>than the other 10,000 people in the world with serious amounts of money, they focus upon&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, this is strange. Eating your own is just&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, I think he&rsquo;s free to do what he wants to do. And I think he&rsquo;s done a lot of good for</p>
<p>Bitcoin in putting it on the balance sheet of Tesla and holding it. And I think that</p>
<p>sent a very powerful message. Do you have advice for young people?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had a heck of a life. You&rsquo;ve done quite a lot of things.</p>
<p>Start before MIT, but starting with MIT. Is there advice here for young people in high school and</p>
<p>college, how to have a career they can be proud of, how to have a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>I was asked by somebody for quick advice for his young children. He had twins when they</p>
<p>enter adulthood. He said, give me your advice for them in a letter. I&rsquo;m going to give it to them</p>
<p>when they turn 21 or something. So then he handed&hellip; I was at a party and then he handed me</p>
<p>this sheet of paper and I thought, oh, he wants me to write it down right now. So I sat down,</p>
<p>I started writing and I figured, well, what would you want to tell someone at age 21?</p>
<p>You wrote it down.</p>
<p>So I wrote it down. And then I tweeted it and it&rsquo;s sitting on Twitter, but I tell you what I said.</p>
<p>I said, my advice if you&rsquo;re entering adulthood, focus your energy, guard your time, train your</p>
<p>mind, train your body, think for yourself, curate your friends, curate your environment,</p>
<p>keep your promises, stay cheerful and constructive, and upgrade the world. That was the 10.</p>
<p>Upgrade the world. That&rsquo;s an interesting choice of words. Upgrade the world. Upgrade the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an engineering train.</p>
<p>Focus your energy. It&rsquo;s a very, yeah, it&rsquo;s a very engineering themed&hellip;</p>
<p>Keep your promises too. That&rsquo;s an interesting one.</p>
<p>I think most people suffer because they don&rsquo;t focus. I think the big risk in this world is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s too much of everything. You can sit and watch chess videos 100 hours a week and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll never get through all the chess videos. There&rsquo;s too much of every possible thing,</p>
<p>too much of every good thing. So figuring out what you want to do and then everything will suck</p>
<p>up your time, right? There&rsquo;s 100 streaming channels to binge watch on. So you got to</p>
<p>guard your time and then train your body, train your mind and control who&rsquo;s around you, control</p>
<p>what surrounds you. So ultimately in a world where there&rsquo;s too much of everything, then</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like those laser eyes. It&rsquo;s like those laser eyes. You have to focus</p>
<p>on just a few of those things.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, I got a thousand opinions we could talk about and I could pursue a thousand things,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t expect to be successful. And I&rsquo;m not sure that my opinion in any of the 999 is any more</p>
<p>valid than the leader of thought in that area. So how about if I just focus upon one thing</p>
<p>and then deliver the best I can in the one thing. That&rsquo;s the laser eye message.</p>
<p>The rest get you distracted.</p>
<p>Well, how do you achieve that? Do you find yourself, given where you are in life,</p>
<p>having to say no a lot? Or just focus comes naturally when you just ignore everything?</p>
<p>So how do you achieve that focus?</p>
<p>I think it helps if people know what you&rsquo;re focused on.</p>
<p>So everything about you just radiates that people know.</p>
<p>If they know what you&rsquo;re focused on, then you won&rsquo;t get so many other things coming your way.</p>
<p>If you dolly or if you flirt with 27 different things,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re going to get approached by people in each of the 27 communities, right?</p>
<p>You mentioned getting a PhD and giving your roots at MIT. Do you think there&rsquo;s all kinds of</p>
<p>journeys you can take to educate yourself? Do you think a PhD or school is still worth it?</p>
<p>Or is there other paths through life that&hellip;</p>
<p>Is it worth it if you have to pay for it? Is it worth it if you spend the time on it?</p>
<p>Yeah. The time and the money is a big cost.</p>
<p>Time probably the bigger one, right?</p>
<p>It seems clear to me that the world wants more specialists. It wants you to be an expert</p>
<p>and to focus on one area. And it&rsquo;s punishing generalists, jack of all trades,</p>
<p>especially people that are generalists in the physical realm. Because if you&rsquo;re a specialist</p>
<p>in the digital realm, you might very well&hellip; You&rsquo;re the person with 700,000 followers on</p>
<p>Twitter and you show them how to tie knots. Or you&rsquo;re the banjo player with 1.8 million followers.</p>
<p>And when everybody types banjo, it&rsquo;s you, right? And so the world wants people that do something</p>
<p>well. And then it wants to stamp out 18 million copies of them. And so that argues in favor of</p>
<p>focus. Now, the definition of a PhD is someone with enough of an education that they&rsquo;re capable</p>
<p>of or have made. I guess to get a PhD, technically, you have to have done a dissertation where you</p>
<p>made a seminal contribution to the body of human knowledge. And if you haven&rsquo;t done that,</p>
<p>technically, you have a master&rsquo;s degree, but you&rsquo;re not a doctor. So if you&rsquo;re interested</p>
<p>in any of the academic disciplines that a PhD would be granted for, then I can see that being</p>
<p>a reasonable pursuit. But there are many people that are specialists. You know the agitator?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>The agitator on YouTube?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s greatest chess commentator.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve watched his career, and he&rsquo;s gotten progressively better, and he&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to love hearing this.</p>
<p>Yeah, if the agitator hears this, I&rsquo;m a big fan of the agitator. I have to cut myself off,</p>
<p>right? Because otherwise, you&rsquo;ll watch the entire Paul Morphy saga for your weekend.</p>
<p>But the point really is YouTube is full of experts who are specialists in something,</p>
<p>and they rise to the top of their profession. And Twitter is too, and the internet is. So I</p>
<p>would advocate that you figure out what you&rsquo;re passionate about and what you&rsquo;re good at, and you</p>
<p>do focus on it. Especially if the thing that you&rsquo;re doing can be automated. The problem is,</p>
<p>back to that 500,000 algebra teacher type comment, the problem is if it is possible to be automated,</p>
<p>then over time, someone&rsquo;s probably going to automate it, and that squeezes the state space</p>
<p>of everybody else. It&rsquo;s like after the lockdowns, it used to be there were all these local bands</p>
<p>that played in bars, and everyone went to the bar to see the local band. And then during the</p>
<p>lockdown, you would have like these six super groups, and they would all get 500,000 or a</p>
<p>million followers, and all these smaller local bands just got no attention at all.</p>
<p>Well, the interesting thing is one of those 500,000 algebra teachers is likely to be part of</p>
<p>the automation. So it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s an opportunity for you to think, where&rsquo;s my field, my discipline,</p>
<p>evolving into? I talked to a bunch of librarians, just happened to be friends with librarians,</p>
<p>and libraries will probably be evolving. And it&rsquo;s up to you as a librarian to be one of the few</p>
<p>that remain in the rubble. If you&rsquo;re going to give commentary on Shakespeare plays,</p>
<p>I want you to basically do it for every Shakespeare play. I want you to be the Shakespeare dude,</p>
<p>because once I, just like Lex, you&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re the deep thinking podcaster, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the podcaster that goes after the deep intellectual conversations. And once I get</p>
<p>comfortable with you, and I like you, then I start binge watching Lex. But if you changed</p>
<p>your format through 16 different formats, so that you could compete with 16 different other</p>
<p>personalities on YouTube, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t beat any of them, right? You would probably just</p>
<p>kind of sink into the, you&rsquo;re the number two or number three guy, you&rsquo;re not the number one guy</p>
<p>in the format. And I think that the algorithm, right, the Twitter algorithm and the YouTube</p>
<p>algorithm, they really reward the person that&rsquo;s focused on message, consistent. The world wants</p>
<p>somebody they can trust that&rsquo;s consistent and reliable. And they kind of want to know what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting into because, and this is taken for granted maybe, but there&rsquo;s 10 million people</p>
<p>vying for every hour of your time. And so the fact that anybody gives you any time at all is a huge</p>
<p>privilege, right? And you should be thanking them. And you should respect their time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting. Like everything you said is very interesting. But of course, from my perspective,</p>
<p>and probably from your perspective, my actual life has nothing to do with, it&rsquo;s just being focused</p>
<p>on stuff. And in my case, it&rsquo;s like focus on doing the thing I really enjoy doing and being myself</p>
<p>and not caring about anything else. Like I don&rsquo;t care about views or likes or attention. And that,</p>
<p>just maintaining that focus is the way, from an individual perspective, you live that life.</p>
<p>But yeah, it does seem that there&rsquo;s the world and technology is rewarding the specialization</p>
<p>and creating bigger and bigger platforms for the different specializations. And that lifts all</p>
<p>boats, actually, because the specializations get better and better and better at teaching people to</p>
<p>do specific things and they educate themselves. And it&rsquo;s just, everybody gets more and more</p>
<p>knowledgeable and more and more empowered. The reward for authenticity more than offsets</p>
<p>the specificity with which you pursue your mission. It&rsquo;s like, another way to say it is like,</p>
<p>nobody wants to read advertising. Like if you were to spend a hundred million dollars</p>
<p>advertising your thing, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t want to watch it. But we see the death of that.</p>
<p>And so the commercial shows are losing their audiences and the authentic</p>
<p>specialists or the authentic artists are gaining their audience.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a beautiful thing. Speaking of deep thinking, you&rsquo;re just a human. Your life ends.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve accumulated so much wisdom, so much money, but the ride ends. Do you think about that?</p>
<p>Do you ponder your death, your mortality? Are you afraid of it?</p>
<p>When I go, all my assets will flow into a foundation and the foundation&rsquo;s mission is to make</p>
<p>education free for everybody forever. And if I&rsquo;m able to contribute to the creation of a more</p>
<p>perfect monetary system, then maybe that foundation will go on forever.</p>
<p>The idea, the foundation of the idea. So each of the foundations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear we&rsquo;re on the S curve of immortal life yet. Like that&rsquo;s a biological question.</p>
<p>And you asked that, you know, on some of your other interviews a lot. I think that we are on</p>
<p>the threshold of immortal life for ideas or immortal life for certain institutions.</p>
<p>Or computer programs. So if we can fix the money, then you can create a technically perfected</p>
<p>endowment. And then the question really is, what are your ideas? What do you want to leave behind?</p>
<p>And so if it&rsquo;s a park, then you endow the park, right? If it&rsquo;s free education, you endow that.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s some other ethical idea, right?</p>
<p>Does it make you sad that there&rsquo;s something that you&rsquo;ve endowed, some very powerful idea</p>
<p>of digital energy that you put out into the world, you help put it into the world,</p>
<p>and your mind, your conscious mind will no longer be there to experience it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just gone forever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather think that the thing that Satoshi taught us is you should do your part during</p>
<p>some phase of the journey, and then you should get out of the way.</p>
<p>I think Steve Jobs said something similar to that effect in a very, very famous speech one day,</p>
<p>which is, you know, death is a natural part of life, and it makes way for the next generation.</p>
<p>And I think the goal is you upgrade the world, right? You leave it a better place,</p>
<p>but you get out of the way. And I think when that breaks down, you know, bad things happen.</p>
<p>I think nature cleanses itself. There&rsquo;s a cycle of life.</p>
<p>And speaking of one of great people who did a great job,</p>
<p>and speaking of one of great people who did also get out of the way is George Washington,</p>
<p>so hopefully when you get out of the way, nobody&rsquo;s bleeding you to death in hope of helping you.</p>
<p>What do you think, to do a bit of a callback, what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life? Why are we here? We talked about the rise of human civilization.</p>
<p>It seems like we&rsquo;re engineers at heart. We build cool stuff, better and better use of energy,</p>
<p>channeling energy to be productive. Why? What&rsquo;s it all for?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting metaphysical on me.</p>
<p>Very. There&rsquo;s a beautiful boat to the left of us. Like, why do we do that? This</p>
<p>boat that sailed the ocean. Then we build models of it to celebrate great engineering of the past.</p>
<p>To engineer is divine. You can make lots of arguments as well. We&rsquo;re here to entertain</p>
<p>ourselves or we&rsquo;re here to create something that&rsquo;s beautiful or something that&rsquo;s functional.</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;re an engineer, you entertain yourself by creating something that&rsquo;s both</p>
<p>beautiful and functional. So I think all three of those things, it&rsquo;s entertaining, but it&rsquo;s ethical.</p>
<p>You know, you got to admire, you know, the first person that built a bridge, crossing a chasm,</p>
<p>or the first person to work out the problem of how to get running water to a village,</p>
<p>the first person to figure out how to, you know, dam up a river, or mastered agriculture,</p>
<p>or the guy that figured out, you know, how to grow fruit on trees or created orchards,</p>
<p>you know, and maybe one day he had like 10 fruit trees, he&rsquo;s pretty proud of himself.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s functional. There is also something to that, just like you said, that&rsquo;s just beautiful.</p>
<p>It does get you closer to, like you said, the divine. Something,</p>
<p>when you step back and look at the entirety of it, a collective of humans using a beautiful</p>
<p>invention, or creation, or just something about this instrument is creating a beautiful piece of music.</p>
<p>That seems just right. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re here for. Whatever the divine is, it seems like we&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>for that. And I, of course, love talking to you because from the engineering perspective,</p>
<p>the functional is ultimately the mechanism towards the beauty.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there something beautiful about making the world a better place for people that you love,</p>
<p>your friends, your family, or yourself?</p>
<p>When you think about the entire arc of human existence, and you roll the clock back 500,000</p>
<p>years, and you think about every struggle of everyone that came before us and everything</p>
<p>they had to overcome in order to put you here right now, you got to admire that, right? You</p>
<p>got to respect that. That&rsquo;s a heck of a gift they gave us, but it&rsquo;s also a heck of a responsibility.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t screw it up. If I dropped you 500,000 years ago, and I said, figure out steel refining,</p>
<p>or figure out silicon chips, fabric production, or whatever it is.</p>
<p>Fly, or fire.</p>
<p>And so now we&rsquo;re here, and I guess the way you repay them is you fix everything in front</p>
<p>of your face you can, right? And that means to someone like Elon, it means get us off the planet,</p>
<p>right? To someone like me, it&rsquo;s like, I think, you know, fix the energy in the system.</p>
<p>And that gives me hope. Michael, this was an incredible conversation. You&rsquo;re an incredible</p>
<p>human. It&rsquo;s a huge honor you would sit down with me. Thank you so much for talking to me.</p>
<p>Yeah, thanks for having me, Lex.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Michael Saylor. To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with a few words from</p>
<p>Francis Bacon. Money is a great servant, but a bad master. Thank you for listening,</p>
<p>and hope to see you next time.</p>
