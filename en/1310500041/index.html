    <p>The following is a conversation with Leonard Susskind.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a professor of theoretical physics</p>
<p>at Stanford University and founding director</p>
<p>of Stanford Institute of Theoretical Physics.</p>
<p>He is widely regarded as one of the fathers</p>
<p>of string theory and in general,</p>
<p>as one of the greatest physicists of our time,</p>
<p>both as a researcher and an educator.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>Perhaps you noticed that the people I&rsquo;ve been speaking with</p>
<p>are not just computer scientists,</p>
<p>but philosophers, mathematicians, writers,</p>
<p>psychologists, physicists, and soon other disciplines.</p>
<p>To me, AI is much bigger than deep learning,</p>
<p>bigger than computing.</p>
<p>It is our civilization&rsquo;s journey</p>
<p>into understanding the human mind</p>
<p>and creating echoes of it in the machine.</p>
<p>If you enjoy the podcast, subscribe on YouTube,</p>

<p>or simply connect with me on Twitter</p>
<p>at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A M.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Leonard Susskind.</p>
<p>You worked and were friends with Richard Feynman.</p>
<p>How has he influenced you, changed you</p>
<p>as a physicist and thinker?</p>
<p>What I saw, I think what I saw was somebody</p>
<p>who could do physics in this deeply intuitive way.</p>
<p>His style was almost to close his eyes</p>
<p>and visualize the phenomena that he was thinking about.</p>
<p>And through visualization, outflank the mathematical,</p>
<p>the highly mathematical and very, very sophisticated</p>
<p>technical arguments that people would use.</p>
<p>I think that was also natural to me,</p>
<p>but I saw somebody who was actually successful at it,</p>
<p>who could do physics in a way that I regarded</p>
<p>as simpler, more direct, more intuitive.</p>
<p>And while I don&rsquo;t think he changed my way of thinking,</p>
<p>I do think he validated it.</p>
<p>He made me look at it and say, yeah,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something you can do and get away with.</p>
<p>Practically didn&rsquo;t get away with it.</p>
<p>So do you find yourself, whether you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about quantum mechanics or black holes</p>
<p>or string theory, using intuition as a first step</p>
<p>or step throughout using visualization?</p>
<p>Yeah, very much so, very much so.</p>
<p>I tend not to think about the equations.</p>
<p>I tend not to think about the symbols.</p>
<p>I tend to try to visualize the phenomena themselves.</p>
<p>And then when I get an insight that I think is valid,</p>
<p>I might try to convert it to mathematics,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not a natural mathematician.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good enough at it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good enough at it, but I&rsquo;m not a great mathematician.</p>
<p>So for me, the way of thinking about physics</p>
<p>is first intuitive, first visualization,</p>
<p>scribble a few equations maybe,</p>
<p>but then try to convert it to mathematics.</p>
<p>Experience is that other people are better</p>
<p>at converting it to mathematics than I am.</p>
<p>And yet you&rsquo;ve worked with very counterintuitive ideas.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>You can visualize something counterintuitive.</p>
<p>How do you dare?</p>
<p>By rewiring your brain in new ways.</p>
<p>Yeah, quantum mechanics is not intuitive.</p>
<p>Very little of modern physics is intuitive.</p>
<p>Intuitive, what does intuitive mean?</p>
<p>It means the ability to think about it</p>
<p>with basic classical physics,</p>
<p>the physics that we evolved with throwing stones,</p>
<p>or splashing water, whatever it happens to be.</p>
<p>Quantum physics, general relativity,</p>
<p>quantum field theory are deeply unintuitive in that way.</p>
<p>But after time and getting familiar with these things,</p>
<p>you develop new intuitions.</p>
<p>I always said you rewire.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s to the point where me and many of my friends,</p>
<p>I and many of my friends,</p>
<p>can think more easily quantum mechanically</p>
<p>than we can classically.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gotten so used to it.</p>
<p>I mean, yes, our neural wiring in our brain</p>
<p>is such that we understand rocks and stones and water</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>We sort of evolved for that.</p>
<p>Evolved for it.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to create a wiring</p>
<p>of neuron like state devices that more naturally</p>
<p>understand quantum mechanics, understand wave function,</p>
<p>understand these weird things?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>I think many of us have evolved the ability</p>
<p>to think quantum mechanically to some extent.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can think like an electron.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean another example.</p>
<p>Forget for a minute quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Just visualizing four dimensional space</p>
<p>or five dimensional space or six dimensional space,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re fundamentally wired</p>
<p>to visualize three dimensions.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even visualize two dimensions or one dimension</p>
<p>without thinking about it as embedded in three dimensions.</p>
<p>If I wanna visualize a line,</p>
<p>I think of the line as being a line in three dimensions.</p>
<p>Or I think of the line as being a line on a piece of paper</p>
<p>with a piece of paper being in three dimensions.</p>
<p>I never seem to be able to, in some abstract and pure way,</p>
<p>visualize in my head the one dimension,</p>
<p>the two dimension, the four dimension, the five dimensions.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s ever gonna happen.</p>
<p>The reason is I think our neural wiring</p>
<p>is just set up for that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we do learn ways</p>
<p>to think about five, six, seven dimensions.</p>
<p>We learn ways, we learn mathematical ways,</p>
<p>and we learn ways to visualize them, but they&rsquo;re different.</p>
<p>And so yeah, I think we do rewire ourselves.</p>
<p>Whether we can ever completely rewire ourselves</p>
<p>to be completely comfortable with these concepts, I doubt.</p>
<p>So that it&rsquo;s completely natural.</p>
<p>To where it&rsquo;s completely natural.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s somewhat, you could argue,</p>
<p>creatures that live in a two dimensional space.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe there are.</p>
<p>And while it&rsquo;s romanticizing the notion of curse,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all living, as far as we know,</p>
<p>in three dimensional space.</p>
<p>But how do those creatures imagine 3D space?</p>
<p>Well, probably the way we imagine 4D,</p>
<p>by using some mathematics and some equations</p>
<p>and some tricks.</p>
<p>Okay, so jumping back to Feynman just for a second.</p>
<p>He had a little bit of an ego.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Why, do you think ego is powerful or dangerous in science?</p>
<p>I think both, both, both.</p>
<p>I think you have to have both arrogance and humility.</p>
<p>You have to have the arrogance to say, I can do this.</p>
<p>Nature is difficult, nature is very, very hard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m smart enough, I can do it.</p>
<p>I can win the battle with nature.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I think you also have to have</p>
<p>the humility to know that you&rsquo;re very likely</p>
<p>to be wrong on any given occasion.</p>
<p>Everything you&rsquo;re thinking could suddenly change.</p>
<p>Young people can come along and say things</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t understand and you&rsquo;ll be lost and flabbergasted.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a combination of both.</p>
<p>You better recognize that you&rsquo;re very limited,</p>
<p>and you better be able to say to yourself,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so limited that I can&rsquo;t win this battle with nature.</p>
<p>It takes a special kind of person</p>
<p>who can manage both of those, I would say.</p>
<p>And I would say there&rsquo;s echoes of that in your own work,</p>
<p>a little bit of ego, a little bit of outside of the box,</p>
<p>humble thinking.</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>So was there a time where you felt,</p>
<p>you looked at yourself and asked,</p>
<p>am I completely wrong about this?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, about the whole thing or about specific things?</p>
<p>The whole thing.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Wait, which whole thing?</p>
<p>Me and me and my ability to do this thing.</p>
<p>Oh, those kinds of doubts.</p>
<p>First of all, did you have those kinds of doubts?</p>
<p>No, I had different kind of doubts.</p>
<p>I came from a very working class background</p>
<p>and I was uncomfortable in academia for,</p>
<p>oh, for a long time.</p>
<p>But they weren&rsquo;t doubts about my ability or my,</p>
<p>they were just the discomfort in being in an environment</p>
<p>that my family hadn&rsquo;t participated in,</p>
<p>I knew nothing about as a young person.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t learn that there was such a thing called physics</p>
<p>until I was almost 20 years old.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I did have certain kind of doubts,</p>
<p>but not about my ability.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I was too worried</p>
<p>about whether I would succeed or not.</p>
<p>I never felt this insecurity, am I ever gonna get a job?</p>
<p>That had never occurred to me that I wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Maybe you could speak a little bit to this sense</p>
<p>of what is academia.</p>
<p>Because I too feel a bit uncomfortable in it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something I can&rsquo;t put quite into words</p>
<p>what you have that&rsquo;s not, doesn&rsquo;t, if we call it music,</p>
<p>you play a different kind of music than a lot of academia.</p>
<p>How have you joined this orchestra?</p>
<p>How do you think about it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I thought about it</p>
<p>as much as I just felt it.</p>
<p>Thinking is one thing, feeling is another thing.</p>
<p>I felt like an outsider until a certain age</p>
<p>when I suddenly found myself the ultimate insider</p>
<p>in academic physics.</p>
<p>And that was a sharp transition, and I wasn&rsquo;t a young man.</p>
<p>I was probably 50 years old.</p>
<p>So you were never quite, it was a phase transition,</p>
<p>you were never quite in the middle.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right, I wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I always felt a little bit of an outsider.</p>
<p>In the beginning, a lot an outsider.</p>
<p>My way of thinking was different,</p>
<p>my approach to mathematics was different,</p>
<p>but also my social background</p>
<p>that I came from was different.</p>
<p>Now these days, half the young people I meet,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re parents or professors.</p>
<p>That was not my case.</p>
<p>But then all of a sudden, at some point,</p>
<p>I found myself at very much the center of,</p>
<p>maybe not the only one at the center,</p>
<p>but certainly one of the people in the center</p>
<p>of a certain kind of physics.</p>
<p>And all that went away, it went away in a flash.</p>
<p>So maybe a little bit with Feynman,</p>
<p>but in general, how do you develop ideas?</p>
<p>Do you work through ideas alone?</p>
<p>Do you brainstorm with others?</p>
<p>Oh, both, both, very definitely both.</p>
<p>The younger time, I spent more time with myself.</p>
<p>Now, because I&rsquo;m at Stanford,</p>
<p>because I have a lot of ex students</p>
<p>and people who are interested in the same thing I am,</p>
<p>I spend a good deal of time, almost on a daily basis,</p>
<p>interacting, brainstorming, as you said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very important part.</p>
<p>I spend less time probably completely self focused</p>
<p>than with a piece of paper</p>
<p>and just sitting there staring at it.</p>
<p>What are your hopes for quantum computers?</p>
<p>So machines that are based on,</p>
<p>that have some elements of leverage quantum mechanical ideas.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not just leveraging quantum mechanical ideas.</p>
<p>You can simulate quantum systems on a classical computer.</p>
<p>Simulate them means solve the Schrodinger equation for them</p>
<p>or solve the equations of quantum mechanics</p>
<p>on a computer, on a classical computer.</p>
<p>But the classical computer is not doing,</p>
<p>is not a quantum mechanical system itself.</p>
<p>Of course it is.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s made of quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not functioning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not functioning as a quantum system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just solving equations.</p>
<p>The quantum computer is truly a quantum system</p>
<p>which is actually doing the things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re programming it to do.</p>
<p>You want to program a quantum field theory.</p>
<p>If you do it in classical physics,</p>
<p>that program is not actually functioning in the computer</p>
<p>as a quantum field theory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just solving some equations.</p>
<p>Physically, it&rsquo;s not doing the things</p>
<p>that the quantum system would do.</p>
<p>The quantum computer is really a quantum mechanical system</p>
<p>which is actually carrying out the quantum operations.</p>
<p>You can measure it at the end.</p>
<p>It intrinsically satisfies the uncertainty principle.</p>
<p>It is limited in the same way that quantum systems</p>
<p>are limited by uncertainty and so forth.</p>
<p>And it really is a quantum system.</p>
<p>That means that what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>when you program something for a quantum system</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re actually building a real version of the system.</p>
<p>The limits of a classical computer,</p>
<p>classical computers are enormously limited</p>
<p>when it comes to the quantum systems.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re enormously limited</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve probably heard this before,</p>
<p>but in order to store the amount of information</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in a quantum state of 400 spins,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not very many, 400 I can put in my pocket,</p>
<p>I can put 400 pennies in my pocket.</p>
<p>To be able to simulate the quantum state</p>
<p>of 400 elementary quantum systems, qubits we call them,</p>
<p>to do that would take more information</p>
<p>than can possibly be stored in the entire universe</p>
<p>if it were packed so tightly</p>
<p>that you couldn&rsquo;t pack any more in.</p>
<p>400 qubits.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if your quantum computer</p>
<p>is composed of 400 qubits,</p>
<p>it can do everything 400 qubits can do.</p>
<p>What kind of space, if you just intuitively think</p>
<p>about the space of algorithms that that unlocks for us,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a whole complexity theory</p>
<p>around classical computers,</p>
<p>measuring the running time of things,</p>
<p>and P, so on, what kind of algorithms</p>
<p>just intuitively do you think it unlocks for us?</p>
<p>Okay, so we know that there are a handful of algorithms</p>
<p>that can seriously beat classical computers</p>
<p>and which can have exponentially more power.</p>
<p>This is a mathematical statement.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s exhibited this in the laboratory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mathematical statement.</p>
<p>We know that&rsquo;s true, but it also seems more and more</p>
<p>that the number of such things is very limited.</p>
<p>Only very, very special problems</p>
<p>exhibit that much advantage for a quantum computer,</p>
<p>of standard problems.</p>
<p>To my mind, as far as I can tell,</p>
<p>the great power of quantum computers</p>
<p>will actually be to simulate quantum systems.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in a certain quantum system</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s too hard to simulate classically,</p>
<p>you simply build a version of the same system.</p>
<p>You build a version of it.</p>
<p>You build a model of it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually functioning as the system.</p>
<p>You run it, and then you do the same thing</p>
<p>you would do to the quantum system.</p>
<p>You make measurements on it, quantum measurements on it.</p>
<p>The advantage is you can run it much slower.</p>
<p>You could say, why bother?</p>
<p>Why not just use the real system?</p>
<p>Why not just do experiments on the real system?</p>
<p>Well, real systems are kind of limited.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t change them.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t manipulate them.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t slow them down so that you can poke into them.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t modify them in arbitrary kinds of ways</p>
<p>to see what would happen if I change the system a little bit.</p>
<p>I think that quantum computers will be extremely valuable</p>
<p>in understanding quantum systems.</p>
<p>At the lowest level of the fundamental laws.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually satisfying the same laws</p>
<p>as the systems that they&rsquo;re simulating.</p>
<p>Okay, so on the one hand, you have things like factoring.</p>
<p>Factoring is the great thing of quantum computers.</p>
<p>Factoring large numbers, that doesn&rsquo;t seem that much</p>
<p>to do with quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>It seems to be almost a fluke that a quantum computer</p>
<p>can solve the factoring problem in a short time.</p>
<p>And those problems seem to be extremely special, rare,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not clear to me</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are a lot of quantum systems.</p>
<p>Chemistry, there&rsquo;s solid state physics,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s material science, there&rsquo;s quantum gravity,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all kinds of quantum field theory.</p>
<p>And some of these are actually turning out</p>
<p>to be applied sciences,</p>
<p>as well as very fundamental sciences.</p>
<p>So we probably will run out of the ability</p>
<p>to solve equations for these things.</p>
<p>Solve equations by the standard methods of pencil and paper.</p>
<p>Solve the equations by the method of classical computers.</p>
<p>And so what we&rsquo;ll do is we&rsquo;ll build versions</p>
<p>of these systems, run them,</p>
<p>and run them under controlled circumstances</p>
<p>where we can change them, manipulate them,</p>
<p>make measurements on them,</p>
<p>and find out all the things we wanna know.</p>
<p>So in finding out the things we wanna know</p>
<p>about very small systems, is there something</p>
<p>that we can also find out about the macro level,</p>
<p>about something about the function, forgive me,</p>
<p>of our brain, biological systems,</p>
<p>the stuff that&rsquo;s about one meter in size</p>
<p>versus much, much smaller?</p>
<p>Well, what all the excitement is about</p>
<p>among the people that I interact with</p>
<p>is understanding black holes.</p>
<p>Black holes.</p>
<p>Black holes are big things.</p>
<p>They are many, many degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>There is another kind of quantum system that is big.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a large quantum computer.</p>
<p>And one of the things we&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>is that the physics of large quantum computers</p>
<p>is in some ways similar to the physics</p>
<p>of large quantum black holes.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re using that relationship.</p>
<p>Now you asked, you didn&rsquo;t ask about quantum computers</p>
<p>or systems, you didn&rsquo;t ask about black holes,</p>
<p>you asked about brains.</p>
<p>Yeah, about stuff that&rsquo;s in the middle of the two.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>So black holes are,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something fundamental about black holes</p>
<p>that feels to be very different than a brain.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And they also function in a very quantum mechanical way.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It is, first of all, unclear to me,</p>
<p>but of course it&rsquo;s unclear to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a neuroscientist.</p>
<p>I have, I don&rsquo;t even have very many friends</p>
<p>who are neuroscientists.</p>
<p>I would like to have more friends who are neuroscientists.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t run into them very often.</p>
<p>Among the few neuroscientists</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever talked about about this,</p>
<p>they are pretty convinced</p>
<p>that the brain functions classically,</p>
<p>that it is not intrinsically a quantum mechanical system</p>
<p>or it doesn&rsquo;t make use of the special features,</p>
<p>entanglement, coherence, superposition.</p>
<p>Are they right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I sort of hope they&rsquo;re wrong</p>
<p>just because I like the romantic idea</p>
<p>that the brain is a quantum system.</p>
<p>But I think probably not.</p>
<p>The other thing,</p>
<p>big systems can be composed of lots of little systems.</p>
<p>Materials, the materials that we work with and so forth</p>
<p>are, can be large systems, a large piece of material,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re made out of quantum systems.</p>
<p>Now, one of the things that&rsquo;s been happening</p>
<p>over the last good number of years</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re discovering materials and quantum systems,</p>
<p>which function much more quantum mechanically</p>
<p>than we imagined.</p>
<p>Topological insulators, this kind of thing,</p>
<p>that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Those are macroscopic systems,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re just superconductors.</p>
<p>Superconductors have a lot of quantum mechanics in them.</p>
<p>You can have a large chunk of superconductor.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a big piece of material.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it&rsquo;s functioning and its properties</p>
<p>depend very, very strongly on quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>And to analyze them, you need the tools of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>If we can go on to black holes</p>
<p>and looking at the universe</p>
<p>as a information processing system,</p>
<p>as a computer, as a giant computer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a giant computer.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the power of thinking of the universe</p>
<p>as an information processing system?</p>
<p>Or what is perhaps its use</p>
<p>besides the mathematical use of discussing black holes</p>
<p>and your famous debates and ideas around that</p>
<p>to human beings,</p>
<p>or life in general as information processing systems?</p>
<p>Well, all systems are information processing systems.</p>
<p>You poke them, they change a little bit, they evolve.</p>
<p>All systems are information processing systems.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no extra magic to us humans?</p>
<p>It certainly feels, consciousness intelligence</p>
<p>feels like magic.</p>
<p>It sure does.</p>
<p>Where does it emerge from?</p>
<p>If we look at information processing,</p>
<p>what are the emergent phenomena</p>
<p>that come from viewing the world</p>
<p>as an information processing system?</p>
<p>Here is what I think.</p>
<p>My thoughts are not worth much in this.</p>
<p>If you ask me about physics,</p>
<p>my thoughts may be worth something.</p>
<p>If you ask me about this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure my thoughts are worth anything.</p>
<p>But as I said earlier,</p>
<p>I think when we do introspection,</p>
<p>when we imagine doing introspection</p>
<p>and try to figure out what it is</p>
<p>when we do when we&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>I think we get it wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure we get it wrong.</p>
<p>Everything I&rsquo;ve heard about the way the brain functions</p>
<p>is so counterintuitive.</p>
<p>For example, you have neurons which detect vertical lines.</p>
<p>You have different neurons</p>
<p>which detect lines at 45 degrees.</p>
<p>You have different neurons.</p>
<p>I never imagined that there were whole circuits</p>
<p>which were devoted to vertical lines in my brain.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the way my brain works.</p>
<p>My brain seems to work if I put my finger up vertically</p>
<p>or if I put it horizontally</p>
<p>or if I put it this way or that way.</p>
<p>It seems to me it&rsquo;s the same circuits.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the way it works.</p>
<p>The way the brain is compartmentalized</p>
<p>seems to be very, very different</p>
<p>than what I would have imagined</p>
<p>if I were just doing psychological introspection</p>
<p>about how things work.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that we won&rsquo;t get it right that way,</p>
<p>that how will we get it right?</p>
<p>I think maybe computer scientists will get it right eventually.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there are any ways near it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even think they&rsquo;re thinking about it,</p>
<p>but eventually we will build machines perhaps</p>
<p>which are complicated enough</p>
<p>and partly engineered, partly evolved,</p>
<p>maybe evolved by machine learning and so forth.</p>
<p>This machine learning is very interesting.</p>
<p>By machine learning, we will evolve systems</p>
<p>and we may start to discover mechanisms</p>
<p>that have implications for how we think</p>
<p>and for what this consciousness thing is all about</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll be able to do experiments on them</p>
<p>and perhaps answer questions</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t possibly answer by introspection.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a really interesting point.</p>
<p>In many cases, if you look at even a string theory,</p>
<p>when you first think about a system,</p>
<p>it seems really complicated, like the human brain,</p>
<p>and through some basic reasoning</p>
<p>and trying to discover fundamental low level behavior</p>
<p>of the system, you find out that it&rsquo;s actually much simpler.</p>
<p>Do you, one, have you, is that generally the process</p>
<p>and two, do you have that also hope</p>
<p>for biological systems as well,</p>
<p>for all the kinds of stuff we&rsquo;re studying at the human level?</p>
<p>Of course, physics always begins</p>
<p>by trying to find the simplest version of something</p>
<p>and analyze it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there are lots of examples</p>
<p>where physics has taken very complicated systems,</p>
<p>analyzed them and found simplicity in them for sure.</p>
<p>I said superconductors before, it&rsquo;s an obvious one.</p>
<p>A superconductor seems like a monstrously complicated thing</p>
<p>with all sorts of crazy electrical properties,</p>
<p>magnetic properties and so forth.</p>
<p>And when it finally is boiled down</p>
<p>to its simplest elements,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very simple quantum mechanical phenomenon</p>
<p>called spontaneous symmetry breaking,</p>
<p>and which we, in other contexts, we learned about</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re very familiar with.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, yes, we do take complicated things,</p>
<p>make them simple, but what we don&rsquo;t want to do</p>
<p>is take things which are intrinsically complicated</p>
<p>and fool ourselves into thinking</p>
<p>that we can make them simple.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to make, I don&rsquo;t know who said this,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t want to make them simpler</p>
<p>than they really are, okay?</p>
<p>Is the brain a thing which ultimately functions</p>
<p>by some simple rules or is it just complicated?</p>
<p>In terms of artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>nobody really knows what are the limits</p>
<p>of our current approaches, you mentioned machine learning.</p>
<p>How do we create human level intelligence?</p>
<p>It seems that there&rsquo;s a lot of very smart physicists</p>
<p>who perhaps oversimplify the nature of intelligence</p>
<p>and think of it as information processing,</p>
<p>and therefore there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be</p>
<p>any theoretical reason why we can&rsquo;t artificially create</p>
<p>human level or superhuman level intelligence.</p>
<p>In fact, the reasoning goes,</p>
<p>if you create human level intelligence,</p>
<p>the same approach you just used</p>
<p>to create human level intelligence</p>
<p>should allow you to create superhuman level intelligence</p>
<p>very easily, exponentially.</p>
<p>So what do you think that way of thinking</p>
<p>that comes from physicists is all about?</p>
<p>I wish I knew, but there&rsquo;s a particular reason</p>
<p>why I wish I knew.</p>
<p>I have a second job.</p>
<p>I consult for Google, not for Google, for Google X.</p>
<p>I am the senior academic advisor</p>
<p>to a group of machine learning physicists.</p>
<p>Now that sounds crazy because I know nothing</p>
<p>about the subject.</p>
<p>I know very little about the subject.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I&rsquo;m good at giving advice,</p>
<p>so I give them advice on things.</p>
<p>Anyway, I see these young physicists</p>
<p>who are approaching the machine learning problem.</p>
<p>There is a real machine learning problem.</p>
<p>Namely, why does it work as well as it does?</p>
<p>Nobody really seems to understand</p>
<p>why it is capable of doing the kind of generalizations</p>
<p>that it does and so forth.</p>
<p>And there are three groups of people</p>
<p>who have thought about this.</p>
<p>There are the engineers.</p>
<p>The engineers are incredibly smart,</p>
<p>but they tend not to think as hard</p>
<p>about why the thing is working</p>
<p>as much as they do how to use it.</p>
<p>Obviously, they provided a lot of data,</p>
<p>and it is they who demonstrated</p>
<p>that machine learning can work much better</p>
<p>than you have any right to expect.</p>
<p>The machine learning systems are systems.</p>
<p>The system&rsquo;s not too different</p>
<p>than the kind of systems that physicists study.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not all that much difference</p>
<p>between quantum, in the structure of mathematics,</p>
<p>physically, yes, but in the structure of mathematics,</p>
<p>between a tensor network designed</p>
<p>to describe a quantum system on the one hand</p>
<p>and the kind of networks that are used in machine learning.</p>
<p>So there are more and more, I think,</p>
<p>young physicists are being drawn</p>
<p>to this field of machine learning,</p>
<p>some very, very good ones.</p>
<p>I work with a number of very good ones,</p>
<p>not on machine learning, but on having lunch.</p>
<p>On having lunch?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I can tell you they are super smart.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t seem to be so arrogant</p>
<p>about their physics backgrounds</p>
<p>that they think they can do things that nobody else can do.</p>
<p>But the physics way of thinking, I think,</p>
<p>will add great value to,</p>
<p>or will bring value to the machine learning.</p>
<p>I believe it will.</p>
<p>And I think it already has.</p>
<p>At what time scale do you think</p>
<p>predicting the future becomes useless</p>
<p>in your long experience</p>
<p>and being surprised at new discoveries?</p>
<p>Well, sometimes a day, sometimes 20 years.</p>
<p>There are things which I thought</p>
<p>we were very far from understanding,</p>
<p>which practically in a snap of the fingers</p>
<p>or a blink of the eye suddenly became understood,</p>
<p>completely surprising to me.</p>
<p>There are other things which I looked at and I said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna understand these things for 500 years,</p>
<p>in particular quantum gravity.</p>
<p>The scale for that was 20 years, 25 years.</p>
<p>And we understand a lot</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t understand it completely now by any means,</p>
<p>but I thought it was 500 years to make any progress.</p>
<p>It turned out to be very, very far from that.</p>
<p>It turned out to be more like 20 or 25 years</p>
<p>from the time when I thought it was 500 years.</p>
<p>So if we may, can we jump around quantum gravity,</p>
<p>some basic ideas in physics?</p>
<p>What is the dream of string theory mathematically?</p>
<p>What is the hope?</p>
<p>Where does it come from?</p>
<p>What problem is it trying to solve?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the dream of string theory</p>
<p>is any different than the dream</p>
<p>of fundamental theoretical physics altogether.</p>
<p>Understanding a unified theory of everything.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like thinking of string theory</p>
<p>as a subject unto itself</p>
<p>with people called string theorists</p>
<p>who are the practitioners</p>
<p>of this thing called string theory.</p>
<p>I much prefer to think of them as theoretical physicists</p>
<p>trying to answer deep fundamental questions about nature,</p>
<p>in particular gravity,</p>
<p>in particular gravity and its connection</p>
<p>with quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>and who at the present time find string theory</p>
<p>a useful tool rather than saying</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a subject called string theorists.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like being referred to as a string theorist.</p>
<p>Yes, but as a tool, is it useful to think about our nature</p>
<p>in multiple dimensions, the strings vibrating?</p>
<p>I believe it is useful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what the main use of it has been up till now.</p>
<p>Well, it has had a number of main uses.</p>
<p>Originally, string theory was invented,</p>
<p>and I know that I was there.</p>
<p>I was right at the spot</p>
<p>where it was being invented literally,</p>
<p>and it was being invented to understand hadrons.</p>
<p>Hadrons are subnuclear particles,</p>
<p>protons, neutrons, mesons,</p>
<p>and at that time, the late 60s, early 70s,</p>
<p>it was clear from experiment</p>
<p>that these particles called hadrons could vibrate,</p>
<p>could rotate, could do all the things</p>
<p>that a little closed string can do,</p>
<p>and it was and is a valid and correct theory of these hadrons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been experimentally tested, and that is a done deal.</p>
<p>It had a second life as a theory of gravity,</p>
<p>the same basic mathematics,</p>
<p>except on a very, very much smaller distance scale.</p>
<p>The objects of gravitation are 19 orders of magnitude</p>
<p>or orders of magnitude smaller than a proton,</p>
<p>but the same mathematics turned up.</p>
<p>The same mathematics turned up.</p>
<p>What has been its value?</p>
<p>Its value is that it&rsquo;s mathematically rigorous in many ways</p>
<p>and enabled us to find mathematical structures</p>
<p>which have both quantum mechanics and gravity.</p>
<p>With rigor, we can test out ideas.</p>
<p>We can test out ideas.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t test them in the laboratory.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re 19 orders of magnitude too small</p>
<p>are things that we&rsquo;re interested in,</p>
<p>but we can test them out mathematically</p>
<p>and analyze their internal consistency.</p>
<p>By now, 40 years ago, 35 years ago, and so forth,</p>
<p>people very, very much questioned the consistency</p>
<p>between gravity and quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Stephen Hawking was very famous for it, rightly so.</p>
<p>Now, nobody questions that consistency anymore.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t because we have mathematically precise</p>
<p>string theories which contain both gravity</p>
<p>and quantum mechanics in a consistent way.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s provided that certainty that quantum mechanics</p>
<p>and gravity can coexist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a small thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very big thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge thing.</p>
<p>Einstein would be proud.</p>
<p>Einstein, he might be appalled.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>He might not be appalled, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t like quantum mechanics very much,</p>
<p>but he would certainly be struck by it.</p>
<p>I think that may be, at this time,</p>
<p>its biggest contribution to physics</p>
<p>in illustrating almost definitively</p>
<p>that quantum mechanics and gravity</p>
<p>are very closely related</p>
<p>and not inconsistent with each other.</p>
<p>Is there a possibility of something deeper,</p>
<p>more profound that still is consistent with string theory</p>
<p>but is deeper, that is to be found?</p>
<p>Well, you could ask the same thing about quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Is there something?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I think string theory is just an example</p>
<p>of a quantum mechanical system</p>
<p>that contains both gravitation and quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>So is there something underlying quantum mechanics?</p>
<p>Perhaps something deterministic.</p>
<p>My friend, Ferad Etouf, whose name you may know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a very famous physicist.</p>
<p>Dutch, not as famous as he should be, but&hellip;</p>
<p>Hard to spell his name.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say his name.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s easy to spell his name.</p>
<p>Apostrophe, he&rsquo;s the only person I know</p>
<p>whose name begins with an apostrophe.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s one of my heroes in physics.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a little younger than me,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s nevertheless one of my heroes.</p>
<p>Etouf believes that there is some substructure to the world</p>
<p>which is classical in character,</p>
<p>deterministic in character,</p>
<p>which somehow by some mechanism</p>
<p>that he has a hard time spelling out</p>
<p>emerges as quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The wave function is somehow emergent.</p>
<p>The wave function, not just the wave function,</p>
<p>but the whole thing that goes with quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>uncertainty, entanglement, all these things,</p>
<p>are emergent. So you think quantum mechanics</p>
<p>is the bottom of the well?</p>
<p>Is the&hellip;</p>
<p>Here I think is where you have to be humble.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where humility comes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anybody should say anything</p>
<p>is the bottom of the well at this time.</p>
<p>I think we can reasonably say,</p>
<p>I can reasonably say when I look into the well,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see past quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any reason for there to be anything</p>
<p>beyond quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>I think Etouf has asked very interesting</p>
<p>and deep questions.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like his answers.</p>
<p>Well, again, let me ask,</p>
<p>if we look at the deepest nature of reality</p>
<p>with whether it&rsquo;s deterministic</p>
<p>or when observed as probabilistic,</p>
<p>what does that mean for our human level</p>
<p>of ideas of free will?</p>
<p>Is there any connection whatsoever</p>
<p>from this perception, perhaps illusion of free will</p>
<p>that we have and the fundamental nature of reality?</p>
<p>The only thing I can say is I am puzzled by that</p>
<p>as much as you are.</p>
<p>The illusion of it.</p>
<p>The illusion of consciousness,</p>
<p>the illusion of free will, the illusion of self.</p>
<p>Does that connect to?</p>
<p>How can a physical system do that?</p>
<p>And I am as puzzled as anybody.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s echoes of it in the observer effect.</p>
<p>So do you understand what it means to be an observer?</p>
<p>I understand it at a technical level.</p>
<p>An observer is a system with enough degrees of freedom</p>
<p>that it can record information</p>
<p>and which can become entangled</p>
<p>with the thing that it&rsquo;s measuring.</p>
<p>Entanglement is the key.</p>
<p>When a system which we call an apparatus or an observer,</p>
<p>same thing, interacts with the system</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s observing, it doesn&rsquo;t just look at it.</p>
<p>It becomes physically entangled with it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that entanglement which we call an observation</p>
<p>or a measurement.</p>
<p>Now, does that satisfy me personally as an observer?</p>
<p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>I find it very satisfying</p>
<p>that we have a mathematical representation</p>
<p>of what it means to observe a system.</p>
<p>You are observing stuff right now, the conscious level.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s echoes of that kind of entanglement</p>
<p>in our macro scale?</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely, for sure.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re entangled with,</p>
<p>quantum mechanically entangled with everything in this room.</p>
<p>If we weren&rsquo;t, then it would just,</p>
<p>well, we wouldn&rsquo;t be observing it.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, you can ask,</p>
<p>do I really, am I really comfortable with it?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m uncomfortable with it in the same way</p>
<p>that I can never get comfortable with five dimensions.</p>
<p>My brain isn&rsquo;t wired for it.</p>
<p>Are you comfortable with four dimensions?</p>
<p>A little bit more,</p>
<p>because I can always imagine the fourth dimension is time.</p>
<p>So the arrow of time, are you comfortable with that arrow?</p>
<p>Do you think time is an emergent phenomena</p>
<p>or is it fundamental to nature?</p>
<p>That is a big question in physics right now.</p>
<p>All the physics that we do,</p>
<p>or at least that the people that I am comfortable</p>
<p>with talking to, my friends, my friends.</p>
<p>No, we all ask the same question that you just asked.</p>
<p>Space, we have a pretty good idea is emergent</p>
<p>and it emerges out of entanglement and other things.</p>
<p>Time always seems to be built into our equations</p>
<p>as just what Newton pretty much would have thought.</p>
<p>Newton, modified a little bit by Einstein,</p>
<p>would have called time.</p>
<p>And mostly in our equations, it is not emergent.</p>
<p>Time in physics is completely symmetric,</p>
<p>forward and backward.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s symmetric.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t really need to think about the arrow of time</p>
<p>for most physical phenomena.</p>
<p>For most microscopic phenomena, no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only when the phenomena involve systems</p>
<p>which are big enough for thermodynamics to become important,</p>
<p>for entropy to become important.</p>
<p>For a small system, entropy is not a good concept.</p>
<p>Entropy is something which emerges out of large numbers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a probabilistic idea or it&rsquo;s a statistical idea</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a thermodynamic idea.</p>
<p>Thermodynamics requires lots and lots</p>
<p>and lots of little substructures, okay?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not until you emerge at the thermodynamic level</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s an arrow of time.</p>
<p>Do we understand it?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think we understand better</p>
<p>than most people think they have.</p>
<p>Most people say they think we understand it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think we understand it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a statistical idea.</p>
<p>You mean like second law of thermodynamics,</p>
<p>entropy and so on?</p>
<p>Yeah, take a pack of cards and you fling it in the air</p>
<p>and you look what happens to it, it gets random.</p>
<p>We understand it.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t go from random to simple.</p>
<p>It goes from simple to random.</p>
<p>But do you think it ever breaks down?</p>
<p>What I think you can do is in a laboratory setting,</p>
<p>you can take a system which is somewhere intermediate</p>
<p>between being small and being large</p>
<p>and make it go backward.</p>
<p>A thing which looks like it only wants to go forward</p>
<p>because of statistical mechanical reasons,</p>
<p>because of the second law,</p>
<p>you can very, very carefully manipulate it</p>
<p>to make it run backward.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can take an egg, a Humpty Dumpty</p>
<p>who fell on the floor and reverse that.</p>
<p>But you can, in a very controlled situation,</p>
<p>you can take systems which appear to be evolving</p>
<p>statistically toward randomness,</p>
<p>stop them, reverse them, and make them go back.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the intuition behind that?</p>
<p>How do we do that?</p>
<p>How do we reverse it?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying a closed system.</p>
<p>Yeah, pretty much closed system, yes.</p>
<p>Did you just say that time travel is possible?</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t say time travel is possible.</p>
<p>I said you can make a system go backward.</p>
<p>In time.</p>
<p>You can make it go back.</p>
<p>You can make it reverse its steps.</p>
<p>You can make it reverse its trajectory.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How do we do it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the intuition there?</p>
<p>Does it have, is it just a fluke thing</p>
<p>that we can do at a small scale in the lab</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t have?</p>
<p>Well, what I&rsquo;m saying is you can do it</p>
<p>a little bit better than a small scale.</p>
<p>You can certainly do it with a simple, small system.</p>
<p>Small systems don&rsquo;t have any sense of the arrow of time.</p>
<p>Atoms, atoms are no sense of an arrow of time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re completely reversible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only when you have, you know,</p>
<p>the second law of thermodynamics</p>
<p>is the law of large numbers.</p>
<p>So you can break the law because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a deterministic law. You can break it,</p>
<p>you can break it, but it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>It requires great care.</p>
<p>The bigger the system is, the more care,</p>
<p>the more, the harder it is.</p>
<p>You have to overcome what&rsquo;s called chaos.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>And it requires more and more precision.</p>
<p>For 10 particles, you might be able to do it</p>
<p>with some effort.</p>
<p>For a hundred particles, it&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>For a thousand or a million particles, forget it,</p>
<p>but not for any fundamental reason,</p>
<p>just because it&rsquo;s technologically too hard</p>
<p>to make the system go backward.</p>
<p>So, no time travel for engineering reasons.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>What is time travel?</p>
<p>Time travel to the future?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>You just close your eyes, go to sleep,</p>
<p>and you wake up in the future.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, a good nap gets you there, yeah.</p>
<p>A good nap gets you there, right.</p>
<p>But reversing the second law of thermodynamics,</p>
<p>going backward in time for anything that&rsquo;s human scale</p>
<p>is a very difficult engineering effort.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t call that time travel</p>
<p>because it gets too mixed up</p>
<p>with what science fiction calls time travel.</p>
<p>This is just the ability to reverse a system.</p>
<p>You take the system and you reverse the direction</p>
<p>of motion of every molecule in it.</p>
<p>That, you can do it with one molecule.</p>
<p>If you find a particle moving in a certain direction,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not say a particle, a baseball,</p>
<p>you stop it dead and then you simply reverse its motion.</p>
<p>In principle, that&rsquo;s not too hard.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll go back along its trajectory</p>
<p>in the backward direction.</p>
<p>Just running the program backwards.</p>
<p>Running the program backward.</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p>If you have two baseballs colliding,</p>
<p>well, you can do it,</p>
<p>but you have to be very, very careful to get it just right.</p>
<p>If you have 10 baseballs, really, really, better yet,</p>
<p>10 billiard balls on an idealized,</p>
<p>frictionless billiard table.</p>
<p>Okay, so you start the balls all on a triangle, right?</p>
<p>And you whack them.</p>
<p>Depending on the game you&rsquo;re playing,</p>
<p>you either whack them or you&rsquo;re really careful,</p>
<p>but you whack them.</p>
<p>And they go flying off in all possible directions.</p>
<p>Okay, try to reverse that.</p>
<p>Try to reverse that.</p>
<p>Imagine trying to take every billiard ball,</p>
<p>stopping it dead at some point,</p>
<p>and reversing its motion</p>
<p>so that it was going in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>If you did that with tremendous care,</p>
<p>it would reassemble itself back into the triangle.</p>
<p>Okay, that is a fact.</p>
<p>And you can probably do it with two billiard balls,</p>
<p>maybe with three billiard balls if you&rsquo;re really lucky.</p>
<p>But what happens is as the system</p>
<p>gets more and more complicated,</p>
<p>you have to be more and more precise</p>
<p>not to make the tiniest error,</p>
<p>because the tiniest errors will get magnified</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll simply not be able to do the reversal.</p>
<p>So yeah, but I wouldn&rsquo;t call that time travel.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s something else.</p>
<p>But if you think of it, it just made me think,</p>
<p>if you think the unrolling of state</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening as a program,</p>
<p>if we look at the world,</p>
<p>silly idea of looking at the world as a simulation,</p>
<p>as a computer.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not a computer, it&rsquo;s just a single program.</p>
<p>A question arises that might be useful.</p>
<p>How hard is it to have a computer that runs the universe?</p>
<p>Okay, so there are mathematical universes</p>
<p>that we know about.</p>
<p>One of them is called anti de Sitter space,</p>
<p>where we, and it&rsquo;s quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>I think we could simulate it in a computer,</p>
<p>in a quantum computer.</p>
<p>Classical computer, all you can do is solve its equations.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t make it work like the real system.</p>
<p>If we could build a quantum computer, a big enough one,</p>
<p>a robust enough one, we could probably simulate a universe,</p>
<p>a small version of an anti de Sitter universe.</p>
<p>Anti de Sitter is a kind of cosmology.</p>
<p>So I think we know how to do that.</p>
<p>The trouble is the universe that we live in</p>
<p>is not the anti de Sitter geometry,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the de Sitter geometry.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t really understand its quantum mechanics at all.</p>
<p>So at the present time,</p>
<p>I would say we wouldn&rsquo;t have the vaguest idea</p>
<p>how to simulate a universe similar to our own.</p>
<p>No, we can ask, could we build in the laboratory</p>
<p>a small version, a quantum mechanical version,</p>
<p>the collection of quantum computers</p>
<p>and tangled and coupled together,</p>
<p>which would reproduce the phenomena that go on in the universe,</p>
<p>even on a small scale.</p>
<p>Yes, if it were anti de Sitter space,</p>
<p>no, if it&rsquo;s de Sitter space.</p>
<p>Can you slightly describe de Sitter space</p>
<p>and anti de Sitter space?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What are the geometric properties of?</p>
<p>They differ by the sign of a single constant</p>
<p>called the cosmological constant.</p>
<p>One of them is negatively curved,</p>
<p>the other is positively curved.</p>
<p>Anti de Sitter space, which is the negatively curved one,</p>
<p>you can think of as an isolated system</p>
<p>in a box with reflecting walls.</p>
<p>You could think of it as a system</p>
<p>of quantum mechanical system isolated</p>
<p>in an isolated environment.</p>
<p>De Sitter space is the one we really live in.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the one that&rsquo;s exponentially expanding,</p>
<p>exponential expansion, dark energy,</p>
<p>whatever we wanna call it.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t understand that mathematically.</p>
<p>Do we understand?</p>
<p>Not everybody would agree with me,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>They would agree with me,</p>
<p>they definitely would agree with me</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>What about, is there an understanding of the birth,</p>
<p>the origin, the big bang?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s one problem with the other.</p>
<p>No, no, there&rsquo;s theories.</p>
<p>There are theories.</p>
<p>My favorite is the one called eternal inflation.</p>
<p>The infinity can be on both sides,</p>
<p>on one of the sides and none of the sides.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s eternal infinity?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Infinity on both sides.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Why is that your favorite?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s the most just mind blowing?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Because we want a beginning.</p>
<p>No, why do we want a beginning?</p>
<p>In practice there was a beginning, of course.</p>
<p>In practice there was a beginning.</p>
<p>But could it have been a random fluctuation</p>
<p>in an otherwise infinite time?</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>In any case, the eternal inflation theory,</p>
<p>I think if correctly understood,</p>
<p>would be infinite in both directions.</p>
<p>How do you think about infinity?</p>
<p>Oh God.</p>
<p>So, okay, of course you can think about it mathematically.</p>
<p>I just finished this discussion with my friend Sergei Brin.</p>
<p>How do you think about infinity?</p>
<p>I say, well, Sergei Brin is infinitely rich.</p>
<p>How do you test that hypothesis?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Such a good line.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s really no way</p>
<p>to visualize some of these things.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, this is a very good question.</p>
<p>Does physics have any,</p>
<p>does infinity have any place in physics?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right, and all I can say is very good question.</p>
<p>So what do you think of the recent first image</p>
<p>of a black hole visualized from the Horizon Telescope?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible triumph of science.</p>
<p>In itself, the fact that there are black holes</p>
<p>which collide is not a surprise.</p>
<p>And they seem to work exactly</p>
<p>the way they&rsquo;re supposed to work.</p>
<p>Will we learn a great deal from it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, we might.</p>
<p>But the kind of things we&rsquo;ll learn</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t really be about black holes.</p>
<p>Why there are black holes in nature</p>
<p>of that particular mass scale and why they&rsquo;re so common</p>
<p>may tell us something about the structure,</p>
<p>evolution of structure in the universe.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gonna tell us</p>
<p>anything new about black holes.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a triumph in the sense</p>
<p>that you go back 100 years</p>
<p>and it was a continuous development,</p>
<p>general relativity, the discovery of black holes,</p>
<p>LIGO, the incredible technology that went into LIGO.</p>
<p>It is something that I never would have believed</p>
<p>was gonna happen 30, 40 years ago.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a magnificent structure,</p>
<p>magnificent thing, this evolution of general relativity,</p>
<p>LIGO, high precision, ability to measure things</p>
<p>on a scale of 10 to the minus 21.</p>
<p>So, astonishing.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re just in awe that this path</p>
<p>took us to this picture.</p>
<p>Is it different?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve thought a lot about black holes.</p>
<p>How did you visualize them in your mind?</p>
<p>And is the picture different than you&rsquo;ve visualized it?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s simply confirmed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a magnificent triumph to have confirmed</p>
<p>a direct observation that Einstein&rsquo;s theory of gravity</p>
<p>at the level of black hole collisions actually works</p>
<p>is awesome, it is really awesome.</p>
<p>I know some of the people who are involved in that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just ordinary people.</p>
<p>And the idea that they could carry this out,</p>
<p>I just, I&rsquo;m shocked.</p>
<p>Yeah, just these little homo sapiens?</p>
<p>Yeah, just these little monkeys.</p>
<p>Yeah, got together and took a picture of&hellip;</p>
<p>Slightly advanced limer&rsquo;s, I think.</p>
<p>What kind of questions can science not currently answer</p>
<p>but you hope might be able to soon?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve already addressed them.</p>
<p>What is consciousness, for example?</p>
<p>You think that&rsquo;s within the reach of science?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s somewhat within the reach of science,</p>
<p>but I think that now I think it&rsquo;s in the hands</p>
<p>of the computer scientists and the neuroscientists.</p>
<p>Not a physicist, with the help.</p>
<p>Perhaps at some point, but I think physicists</p>
<p>will try to simplify it down to something</p>
<p>that they can use their methods</p>
<p>and maybe they&rsquo;re not appropriate.</p>
<p>Maybe we simply need to do more machine learning</p>
<p>on bigger scales, evolve machines.</p>
<p>Machines not only that learn</p>
<p>but evolve their own architecture.</p>
<p>As a process of learning, evolve in architecture.</p>
<p>Not under our control, only partially under our control,</p>
<p>but under the control of machine learning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you another thing that I find awesome.</p>
<p>You know this Google thing that they taught</p>
<p>the computers how to play chess?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, they taught the computers how to play chess,</p>
<p>not by teaching them how to play chess,</p>
<p>but just having them play against each other.</p>
<p>Against each other, self play.</p>
<p>Against each other, this is a form of evolution.</p>
<p>These machines evolved, they evolved in intelligence.</p>
<p>They evolved in intelligence</p>
<p>without anybody telling them how to do it.</p>
<p>They were not engineered, they just played</p>
<p>against each other and got better and better and better.</p>
<p>That makes me think that machines can evolve intelligence.</p>
<p>What exact kind of intelligence, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But in understanding that better and better,</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;ll get better clues as to what goes on</p>
<p>in our own intelligence.</p>
<p>What life in intelligence is.</p>
<p>Last question, what kind of questions can science</p>
<p>not currently answer and may never be able to answer?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is there an intelligence out there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s underlies the whole thing?</p>
<p>You can call them with a G word if you want.</p>
<p>I can say, are we a computer simulation with a purpose?</p>
<p>Is there an agent, an intelligent agent</p>
<p>that underlies or is responsible for the whole thing?</p>
<p>Does that intelligent agent satisfy the laws of physics?</p>
<p>Does it satisfy the laws of quantum mechanics?</p>
<p>Is it made of atoms and molecules?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of questions.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see, it seems to me a real question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an answerable question.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s answerable.</p>
<p>The questions have to be answerable to be real.</p>
<p>Some philosophers would say that a question</p>
<p>is not a question unless it&rsquo;s answerable.</p>
<p>This question doesn&rsquo;t seem to me answerable</p>
<p>by any known method, but it seems to me real.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no better place to end.</p>
<p>Leonard, thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
