    <p>The following is a conversation with Fiona Hill, a presidential advisor and</p>
<p>foreign policy expert specializing in Russia.</p>
<p>She has served the Bush, Obama, and Trump administrations, including being</p>
<p>a top advisor on Russia to Donald Trump.</p>
<p>She has made it to the white house from humble beginnings in the north of</p>
<p>England, a story she tells in her book, there&rsquo;s nothing for you here.</p>
<p>And now a quick two second mention of each sponsor, check them out in the</p>
<p>description, it&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast, we got misanomane</p>
<p>for style, calm for meditation, let it greens for multivitamins and happiness</p>
<p>and element for electrolytes and also happiness choose wise in my friends.</p>
<p>And now onto the full ad reads as always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make these interesting, but if you skip them, please</p>
<p>still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>They bring me happiness and maybe they will bring happiness to you as well.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by misanomane.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wearing a misanomane shirt right now.</p>
<p>They make comfortable, stylish.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why there was an increase in intonation.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ve been spending a little too much time in San Francisco recently.</p>
<p>Just kidding.</p>
<p>Friends, just kidding.</p>
<p>The maker of comfortable, stylish dress shirts is what misanomane is.</p>
<p>Uh, I just have their black dress shirts.</p>
<p>They have a bunch of stylish ones, but you know, uh, minimalism,</p>
<p>simplicity sets my soul ablaze.</p>
<p>It feels like an expression that nobody says anymore or maybe ever said ever.</p>
<p>The way it fits, the way it feels, it&rsquo;s breathable, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>lightweight, it just feels great.</p>
<p>My favorite dress shirt that I&rsquo;ve ever worn.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not wearing a suit and tie and I&rsquo;m not wearing a t-shirt, like the,</p>
<p>the in-between is usually a black dress shirt and, um, which I&rsquo;ve done for</p>
<p>many, many, many years and when I discovered misanomane, that was just</p>
<p>like an upgrade physically and spiritually.</p>
<p>Right now you can get a special discount.</p>
<p>Just go to misanomane.com and use promo code Lex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Calm.</p>
<p>The best name for a meditation app.</p>
<p>It is a meditation and mental wellness app.</p>
<p>Over 100 million people around the world use it to take care of their</p>
<p>minds as a dog is barking outside.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s a way to have an app that guides meditation for dogs.</p>
<p>Of course, cats have already achieved Zen status.</p>
<p>They give zero Fs about any of the troubles of the world.</p>
<p>For better or worse, our mind is not as Zen as a cat&rsquo;s, uh, the human mind, the</p>
<p>human mind is full of complex traumas and difficulties and stresses and, uh, fears</p>
<p>and hopes and just the rollercoaster of life and through that you have to remain</p>
<p>centered and meditation, guided meditation is great for that.</p>
<p>I can highly recommend Calm.</p>
<p>You can get a discount on their premium subscription, which includes</p>
<p>hundreds of hours of programming.</p>
<p>Check it out at calm.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by one of my, if not the favorite</p>
<p>sponsor of all time, the greatest of all time, the goat of sponsors.</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a ranking.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not an ELO rating for sponsors, but I really enjoy those guys.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re great.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>They make a drink that I drink twice a day.</p>
<p>Now, AG1, it has all the nutritional stuff in it that you&rsquo;ll ever need.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically replaces the multivitamin and, uh, helps you achieve peak</p>
<p>mental and physical performance.</p>
<p>Whatever the heck crazy stuff you do every day, which I do as well, fasting,</p>
<p>keto, all that kind of stuff, stress, whatever the heck is going on with my</p>
<p>life, maybe I forget to eat or maybe I eat a bunch of nonsense that I shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have eaten, all that together combined is okay, as long as you have that basis</p>
<p>with Athletic Greens and they have travel packs, which I travel with.</p>
<p>And when I forget to bring them with me, I have an existential crisis.</p>
<p>No, I I&rsquo;m okay, but it does make me feel better.</p>
<p>It makes me feel like I&rsquo;m at home when I bring them with me.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you a one month supply of fish oil.</p>
<p>When you sign up at AthleticGreens.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This episode is brought to you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like the goats of sponsors on this episode today.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, some sponsors I use a little bit, some sponsors I use a lot, and this is a</p>
<p>lot.</p>
<p>So Element electrolyte drink mix I drink many times a day.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m about to go on a run now, I&rsquo;m going to drink some Element to make sure</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have the electrolytes I need in case I&rsquo;m feeling pretty good about myself.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to do like more than 10 miles, 10, 12, 14, 15.</p>
<p>One of these days, I&rsquo;m just going to keep running.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to I&rsquo;m going to pull a Forrest Gump.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to keep running.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not going to be a podcast.</p>
<p>All my responsibilities, the people waiting for me on meetings, all the stuff at MIT</p>
<p>and my personal life, tweets, all of that is just going to disappear.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s going to be me with a beard running somewhere in the middle of the</p>
<p>country.</p>
<p>And the only thing I&rsquo;ll have with me besides maybe coffee and the diners I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>stop along the way is Element.</p>
<p>Anyway, get a simple pack for free with any purchase.</p>
<p>Try it at drinkelementlmnt.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Fiona Hill.</p>
<p>You came from humble beginning in a coal mining town in northeast England.</p>
<p>So what were some formative moments in your young life that made you the woman</p>
<p>you are today?</p>
<p>I was born in 1965, and it was the period where the whole coal sector in Britain</p>
<p>was in decline already.</p>
<p>And, you know, basically my father, by the time I came along, had lost his job</p>
<p>multiple times.</p>
<p>Every coal mine he worked in was closing down.</p>
<p>He was looking constantly for other work and he had no qualifications because at</p>
<p>age 14, he&rsquo;d gone down the mines.</p>
<p>His father had gone down the mines at 13.</p>
<p>His great-grandfather, you know, around the same kind of age.</p>
<p>I mean, you had a lot of people, you know, at different points going down coal mines</p>
<p>at 12, 13, you know, 14.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t get educated beyond that period because the expectation was, hey,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to go down the mine like everybody else in your family.</p>
<p>And then he didn&rsquo;t really have any other qualifications to, you know, basically</p>
<p>find another job beyond something in manual labor.</p>
<p>So he worked in a steelworks that didn&rsquo;t work out, a brickworks that closed down.</p>
<p>And then he went to work in the local hospital, part of the National Health</p>
<p>Service in the United Kingdom as a porter, an orderly.</p>
<p>So basically somebody&rsquo;s just pushing people around.</p>
<p>There was no opportunity to retrain.</p>
<p>So the big issue in my family was education.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to have one.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;ve got to have some qualifications.</p>
<p>The world is changing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s changing really quickly.</p>
<p>And for you to kind of keep up with it, you&rsquo;re going to have to get educated and</p>
<p>find a way out of this.</p>
<p>And very early on, my father had basically said to me, there&rsquo;s nothing for you here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to, if you want to get ahead.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t have any kind of idea that as a girl I wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, actually, in many respects, I think I benefited from being a girl rather</p>
<p>than a boy.</p>
<p>There was no expectation that I would go into industry.</p>
<p>There was, you know, some kind of idea that maybe I, you know, if I got</p>
<p>qualifications, I could be a nurse.</p>
<p>My mother was a midwife.</p>
<p>And so she&rsquo;d at age 16 left school and gone to train as a nurse and then as a</p>
<p>midwife.</p>
<p>I had other relatives who&rsquo;d gone to teach, you know, in local schools.</p>
<p>And so there was an idea that, you know, women could get educated and there was a</p>
<p>kind of a range of things that you could do.</p>
<p>But the expectation then was go out there, do something with your life, but also a</p>
<p>sense that you&rsquo;d probably have to leave.</p>
<p>So all of that was circling around me, particularly in my teenage years, as I</p>
<p>was trying to find my way through life and looking forward.</p>
<p>First of all, what does that even look like, getting educated, given the context</p>
<p>of that place?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole world of mystery out there.</p>
<p>So how do you figure out what to actually do out there?</p>
<p>But was there moments, formative moments, either challenging or just inspiring,</p>
<p>where you wondered about what you want to be, where you want to go?</p>
<p>Yeah, there were, I mean, there were a number of things.</p>
<p>I mean, I think like a lot of kids, you know, you talk to people and particularly</p>
<p>from blue-collar backgrounds, you say, what did you want to do?</p>
<p>Boys might say, I wanted to be a fireman, you know, or you got, you know, kind of,</p>
<p>at one point as a little girl, I wanted to be a nurse.</p>
<p>I had a little nurse&rsquo;s uniform like my mother.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really know what that meant, but, you know, I used to go around</p>
<p>pretending to be a nurse.</p>
<p>I even had a little magazine called Nurse Nancy, and I used to read this.</p>
<p>And, you know, kind of that was one of the formative ideas.</p>
<p>We also, it was a rural area, semi-rural area, and, you know, I&rsquo;d be out in the</p>
<p>fields all the time and I&rsquo;d watch farmers, you know, with their animals and I&rsquo;d see</p>
<p>vets coming along and, you know, watching people deal with the livestock.</p>
<p>And there was a kind of a famous story at the time about a vet called James</p>
<p>Herriot, it became here in the United States as well and was a sort of a TV</p>
<p>miniseries.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d written a book and he was the vet for my, one of my great aunt&rsquo;s dogs and</p>
<p>people were always talking about him.</p>
<p>And I thought, oh, I could be a vet.</p>
<p>And then one day I saw one of the local vets with his hand up the backside of a</p>
<p>cow in a field and he&rsquo;d got his hand stuck and the cow was kicking him.</p>
<p>And I thought, yeah, maybe, maybe not actually.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think I want to be a vet.</p>
<p>So I cycled through all of these things about, okay, I could get an education, but</p>
<p>the whole sense was you had to apply your education.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t an education for education&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>It was an education to do something.</p>
<p>And when I was about 14 or 15, my local member of parliament came to the school</p>
<p>and it was one of these, you know, pep talks for kids in these, you know,</p>
<p>deprived areas.</p>
<p>He had been quite prominent in local education and now he was a member of</p>
<p>parliament.</p>
<p>He himself had come from a really hard scrabble background and had risen up</p>
<p>through education.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d even gone to Oxford and done philosophy, politics and economics.</p>
<p>And he basically told my class, even though it was highly unlikely any of us</p>
<p>were really going to get ahead and go to elite institutions, look, you can get an</p>
<p>education.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be held back by your circumstances.</p>
<p>But if you do get an education, it&rsquo;s a privilege and you need to do something</p>
<p>with it.</p>
<p>So then I&rsquo;m thinking, well, what could I do?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>An education is a qualification.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to do something.</p>
<p>Most people around me I didn&rsquo;t, I knew didn&rsquo;t have careers.</p>
<p>I mean, my dad didn&rsquo;t really have a career.</p>
<p>He had jobs.</p>
<p>My mom, you know, thought of her nursing as a career though, and it genuinely was.</p>
<p>And she was out there trying to help women survive childbirth.</p>
<p>My mother had these horrific stories, you know, basically over the dining room</p>
<p>table that I wish she&rsquo;d stop.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d leave out her nursing books.</p>
<p>And I tell you, if everyone had had my mom as a, as a mother, there&rsquo;d be no,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;d be no reproduction on the planet.</p>
<p>It was just these grim, horrific stories of breached births and fistulas and</p>
<p>all kinds of horrors that my sister and I would just go, Oh my God, you know,</p>
<p>what, please stop.</p>
<p>So I thought, well, you know, I don&rsquo;t necessarily want to go in that, in that</p>
<p>direction, but it was the timing that really cinched things for me.</p>
<p>I was very lucky that the region that I grew up, County Durham, despite the</p>
<p>massive decline, de-industrialization and the complete collapse of the local</p>
<p>government system around me, still maintained money for education.</p>
<p>And they also paid for exchanges and we had exchange programs with cities in</p>
<p>Germany and France, also in Russia and Kostroma near Yaroslavl, for example,</p>
<p>an old textile town, similar, you know, down in its kind of region, but quite</p>
<p>historic in the Russian context.</p>
<p>In fact, the original birthplace of the Romanov dynasty in Kostroma, just as</p>
<p>County Durham, you know, was quite a distinguished historic area in the</p>
<p>British context.</p>
<p>And so it was an idea that I could go on exchanges.</p>
<p>I could learn languages.</p>
<p>I studied German, I studied French.</p>
<p>And then in 1983, there was the war scare, basically provoked by the Euro</p>
<p>missile crisis.</p>
<p>So the stationing of new categories of strategic nuclear weapons and</p>
<p>intermediate nuclear weapons in Western Europe and in Eastern Europe during the</p>
<p>height of the Cold War.</p>
<p>And this Euro missile crisis over SS-20 and Pershing missiles went on from</p>
<p>1977, so when I was about 11 or 12, you know, all the way through into the</p>
<p>later part of the 1980s.</p>
<p>And in 1983, we came extraordinarily close to a nuclear conflict.</p>
<p>It was very much another rerun of the Cuban missile crisis of 1962.</p>
<p>So 20 years on, same kind of thing.</p>
<p>The Soviets misread, although I didn&rsquo;t know this at the time, I know a lot of</p>
<p>this, you know, after the fact, but the tension was palpable.</p>
<p>But what happened was the Soviets misread the intentions of a series of</p>
<p>exercises, Operation Able Archer, that the United States was conducting and</p>
<p>actually thought that the United States might be preparing for a first nuclear</p>
<p>strike. And that then set off a whole set of literal chain reactions in the Soviet</p>
<p>Union. Eventually, it was recognized that, you know, all of this was really based on</p>
<p>misperceptions.</p>
<p>And of course, you know, that later led to negotiations between Gorbachev and</p>
<p>Reagan for the Intermediate Nuclear Forces, the INF Treaty.</p>
<p>But in 1983, that tension was just acute.</p>
<p>And for as a teenager, we were basically being prepped the whole time for the</p>
<p>inevitability of nuclear Armageddon.</p>
<p>There were TV series, films in the United States and the UK, threads the day after.</p>
<p>We had all these public service announcements telling us to seek sanctuary or</p>
<p>cover in the inevitability of a nuclear blast.</p>
<p>And, you know, my house was so small, they said, look for a room without a</p>
<p>window. There were no rooms without windows.</p>
<p>My dad put on these really thick curtains over the window, you know, and said if</p>
<p>there was a nuclear flash, you know, we&rsquo;d have to, you know, get down on the floor,</p>
<p>not look up, but the curtains would help.</p>
<p>And we were like, this is ridiculous, Dad.</p>
<p>And we would all try to see if we could squeeze in the space under the stairs, a</p>
<p>cupboard under the stairs like Harry Potter.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s all just, you know, totally nuts.</p>
<p>Or you had to throw yourself in a ditch if you were outside.</p>
<p>And I thought, well, this isn&rsquo;t going to work.</p>
<p>And one of my great uncles who had fought in World War II said, well, look, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>good at languages, Fiona.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you go and study Russian, try to figure it out, figure out why the</p>
<p>Russians are trying to blow us up?</p>
<p>Because, you know, during the&hellip;</p>
<p>Go talk to them.</p>
<p>Exactly. During World War II, the United Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet</p>
<p>Union had all been wartime allies.</p>
<p>And my uncle Charlie thought, well, there&rsquo;s something gone wrong here.</p>
<p>Maybe you can figure it out.</p>
<p>And as you said, go talk to them.</p>
<p>So I thought, OK, I&rsquo;ll study Russian.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really how this came about.</p>
<p>I thought, well, it&rsquo;s applying education.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just do my very best to understand everything I possibly can about the</p>
<p>Russian language and the Soviet Union, and I&rsquo;ll see what I can do.</p>
<p>And I thought, well, maybe I could become a translator.</p>
<p>So I had visions of myself sitting around, you know, listening to things in a big</p>
<p>headset and, you know, basically translating, perhaps at some, you know,</p>
<p>future arms control summits.</p>
<p>So how did the journey continue with learning Russian?</p>
<p>I mean, this early dream of being a translator and thinking, how can I</p>
<p>actually help understand or maybe help even deeper away with this conflict that</p>
<p>threatens the existence of the human species?</p>
<p>How did it actually continue?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I read everything I actually possibly could about, you know,</p>
<p>nuclear weapons and nuclear war.</p>
<p>And, you know, I started to try to teach myself, you know, Russian a little bit.</p>
<p>So it was always in context of nuclear war?</p>
<p>It was very much in the context of nuclear war at this particular point, but</p>
<p>also in historical context, because I knew that the United States and the United</p>
<p>Kingdom and the Soviet Union had been wartime allies in World War II, so I</p>
<p>tried to understand all of that.</p>
<p>And also, you know, I, like many other people, I&rsquo;d read, you know, Russian</p>
<p>literature in translation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d read War and Peace and, you know, I&rsquo;d love the book, actually.</p>
<p>I mean, particularly the, you know, the story parts of it.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t one really at that time when I was a teenager.</p>
<p>I thought Tolstoy went on a bit, you know, in terms of his series of the</p>
<p>Great Man and of history and, you know, kind of social change, although now I</p>
<p>appreciate it more.</p>
<p>But when I was about 14, I was like, this man needed an editor.</p>
<p>You know, could he have just gone on with the story?</p>
<p>What an amazing story, what an incredible, you know, kind of book this is.</p>
<p>I still think he needs an editor, but.</p>
<p>Well, I think his wife tried, didn&rsquo;t she?</p>
<p>But he got quite upset with her.</p>
<p>And then I kind of thought to myself, well, how do I, how do I study Russian?</p>
<p>Because there were very few schools in my region, you know, given the</p>
<p>impoverishment of the region where you could study Russian.</p>
<p>So I would have to take Russian from scratch.</p>
<p>And this is where things get really quite interesting.</p>
<p>Because there were opportunities to study Russian at universities, but I would need</p>
<p>to have, first of all, an intensive Russian language course in the summer.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t have the money for that.</p>
<p>And the period is around the miners&rsquo; strike in the United Kingdom in 1984.</p>
<p>Now, the miners of County Durham had very interestingly had exchanges and ties with</p>
<p>the miners of Donbass, going back to the 1920s.</p>
<p>And as I studied Russian history, I discovered there was lots of contacts</p>
<p>between, you know, Bolshevik, Soviet Union, the early period after the Russian</p>
<p>revolution, but even before that, during the imperial period in Russia, between</p>
<p>the Northern England and the Russian empire and the old industrial areas.</p>
<p>Basically big industrial areas like the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union, the</p>
<p>industrial areas like the northeast of England and places like Donbass were built</p>
<p>up at the same time, often by the same sets of industrialists.</p>
<p>And Donetsk in the Donbass region used to be called Husevka because it was</p>
<p>established by a Welsh industrialist who brought in miners from Wales to help, you</p>
<p>know, kind of develop the coal mines there and also the steelworks and others that,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re hearing about all the time.</p>
<p>So I got very fascinated in all these linkages and, you know, famous writers from</p>
<p>parts of the Soviet Union, like Yevgeny Zamyatin, worked in the shipyards in</p>
<p>Newcastle, Pontine.</p>
<p>And there was just this whole set of connections.</p>
<p>And in 1984, when the miners strike took place, the miners of Donbass, along with</p>
<p>other miners from famous coal regions like the Ruhr Valley, for example, in</p>
<p>Germany or miners in Poland, sent money in solidarity to the miners of County Durham.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;d been these exchanges, as I said, going back and forth since the 1920s,</p>
<p>formal exchanges between miners, you know, the region, the miners&rsquo; unions.</p>
<p>And I heard, again from the same great uncle who told me to study Russian, that</p>
<p>there were actually scholarships for the children of miners, and it could be</p>
<p>former miners as well, for their education.</p>
<p>And I should go along to the miners&rsquo; hall, a place called Red Hills, where the</p>
<p>miners of County Durham had actually pooled all of their resources and built up</p>
<p>their own parliament and their own, you know, kind of place that they could talk</p>
<p>among themselves to figure out how to enhance the welfare and wellbeing of their</p>
<p>communities. And they&rsquo;d put money aside for education for miners.</p>
<p>There was all kinds of lecture series from the miners and all kinds of other</p>
<p>activities supporting soccer teams and artistic circles and writing circles, for</p>
<p>example. People like George Orwell, you know, were involved in some of these</p>
<p>writer&rsquo;s circles in other parts of Britain in mining communities, for example.</p>
<p>And so they told me I could, you know, go along and basically apply for a grant to</p>
<p>go to study Russian. So I show up and it was the easiest, you know, application</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever come across. They just asked me to, my dad came along with me.</p>
<p>They asked me to verify, you know, that my dad had been a miner and they looked up</p>
<p>his employment record on little cards, you know, kind of a little, a little tray</p>
<p>somewhere. And then they asked me how much I needed, you know, to basically pay</p>
<p>for the travel and some of the basic expenses for the study.</p>
<p>And they wrote me a cheque. And so thanks to the miners of Donbass and this money</p>
<p>that was deposited with the miners of County Durham at the Durham Miners</p>
<p>Association, I got the money to study Russian for the first time before I embarked</p>
<p>on my studies at university.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;re speaking now, it&rsquo;s reminding me that there&rsquo;s a different way to look both</p>
<p>at history and at geography and at different places is, you know, this is an</p>
<p>industrial region.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And it echoes in the experience of living there is more captured not by Moscow or</p>
<p>Kiev, but by, at least historically, but by just being a mining town and industrial town.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. In the place itself.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, there are places in the United States and Appalachia and West Virginia and in</p>
<p>Pennsylvania, like the Lehigh Valley, that have the same sense of place.</p>
<p>And the northeast of England was the cradle of the industrial revolution.</p>
<p>It was the industrial version of Silicon Valley, which has its own, I would say,</p>
<p>contours and frames.</p>
<p>And when you come to those industrial areas, your previous identities get submerged in</p>
<p>that larger framework.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always looked at the world through that lens of being, you know, someone from the</p>
<p>working class, the blue collar communities from a very specific place with lots of</p>
<p>historical and economic connotations.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also a melting pot, which is the problems that the Donbass has experienced</p>
<p>over, you know, the last 30 years that people came from all over the place to work</p>
<p>there. Of course, it was a population that one might say is indigenous, you know, might</p>
<p>have gone back centuries there, but they would have been, you know, in the smaller</p>
<p>rural farming communities, just like it was the same in the northeast of England.</p>
<p>And people in the case of the northeast of England came from Wales, they came from</p>
<p>further in the south of England, the Midlands, they came from Scotland, they came</p>
<p>from Ireland. I have all of that heritage in my own personal background.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got a different identity.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s when somebody else tries to impose an identity on you from the outside that</p>
<p>things go awry. And I think that that&rsquo;s kind of what we&rsquo;ve really seen in the case of</p>
<p>Donbass. It&rsquo;s a place that&rsquo;s a part in many respects, historically, and in terms of its</p>
<p>evolution and development over time.</p>
<p>And, you know, particularly in the case of Russia, the Russians have tried to say, well,</p>
<p>look, you know, because most people speak Russian, there is the lingua franca.</p>
<p>I mean, in the northeast of England, of course, everyone spoke English, but lots of</p>
<p>people were Irish speakers, you know, Gaelic-Irish speakers or, you know, some of them</p>
<p>might have certainly been Welsh speakers.</p>
<p>There was lots of Welsh miners who spoke Welsh as their first language who came there,</p>
<p>you know, but they created an identity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same in Belfast, in Ulster, you know, the northern province of the whole of</p>
<p>the Irish island, you know, the part of Ireland that is still part of the United</p>
<p>Kingdom. That was also a heavily industrialized area, high manufacturing, mass</p>
<p>manufacturing, shipbuilding, for example.</p>
<p>People came from all over there, too, which is why when Ireland got its independence in</p>
<p>the United Kingdom, Ulster, Belfast and that whole region, you know, kind of clung on</p>
<p>because it was, again, that melting pot.</p>
<p>It was kind of intertwined with the larger industrial economy and had a very different</p>
<p>identity. And so that, you know, for me growing up in such a specific place with such a</p>
<p>special, in many respects, heritage gave me a different perspective on things.</p>
<p>When I first went to the Soviet Union in 1987 to study there, I actually went to a</p>
<p>translator&rsquo;s institute, what was then called the Maurice Therese, which is now the</p>
<p>Institute of Foreign Languages.</p>
<p>I was immediately struck by how similar everything was to the north of England because</p>
<p>it was just like one big working class culture that sort of broken out onto the national</p>
<p>stage. Everything in northern England was nationalized.</p>
<p>We had British steel, British coal, British rail, British shipbuilding, because after</p>
<p>World War Two, the private sector had been devastated and the state had to step in.</p>
<p>And of course, the Soviet Union is one big, giant, nationalized economy when I get there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just the people&rsquo;s attitudes and outlooks are the same.</p>
<p>People didn&rsquo;t work for themselves.</p>
<p>They always worked for somebody else.</p>
<p>And it had quite a distortion on the way that people looked at the world.</p>
<p>Do you still speak Russian?</p>
<p>I do. Yeah.</p>
<p>You speak Russian?</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>If you want to.</p>
<p>Well, yes, then I need to say something and everyone will think about what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Yeah, it would be a big mystery for everybody.</p>
<p>And you have an advantage on me because it&rsquo;s your native language as well.</p>
<p>For people wondering, the English speakers in the audience, you&rsquo;re really missing a lot</p>
<p>from the few sentences we said there.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a fascinating language that stretches actually geographically across a very large</p>
<p>part of this world. So there you are in 1987, an exchange student in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>What was that world like?</p>
<p>Well, that was absolutely fascinating in that period because it&rsquo;s the period that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>around the time of the peak of perestroika, Mikhail Gorbachev&rsquo;s role as president.</p>
<p>Well, it wasn&rsquo;t quite president at that point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Secretary General of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union trying to transform the</p>
<p>whole place. So I arrived there in September of 1987, just as Gorbachev and Reagan sign</p>
<p>the INF Treaty.</p>
<p>It was just within, you know, kind of weeks of them about to sign that, which really ends</p>
<p>that whole period that had shaped my entire teenage years of the end of the Euromissile</p>
<p>crisis by finally having an agreement on, you know, basically the reduction and</p>
<p>constraints on intermediate nuclear forces.</p>
<p>And also at this point, Gorbachev is opening the Soviet Union up.</p>
<p>So we got all kinds of opportunities to travel in ways that we wouldn&rsquo;t have done before,</p>
<p>not just, you know, in Moscow, which is where I was studying at the translation institute,</p>
<p>went to the Caucasus, to Central Asia, went all the way to Khabarovsk in the Russian</p>
<p>Far East, all the way around, you know, kind of Moscow.</p>
<p>And there was at this point, it was also the Kresenye Rus&rsquo;, which has become very</p>
<p>important now. This is the anniversary, the thousandth anniversary of the Christianization</p>
<p>of Russia, which, of course, has become a massive obsession of Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But, you know, 988, because I was there 87 to 88.</p>
<p>And at this point, the Russian Orthodox Church is undergoing a revival from being</p>
<p>repressed during the Soviet period.</p>
<p>You certainly have the church stepping out as a non-governmental organization and</p>
<p>engaging in discussions with people about the future of religion.</p>
<p>So that was something that I wasn&rsquo;t expecting to witness.</p>
<p>Also, I mean, being in Moscow, this is the cultural capital of a vast empire at this</p>
<p>point. I&rsquo;d never lived in a major city before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first big city I lived in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never been to the opera.</p>
<p>You know, the first time I got an opera, it&rsquo;s at the Bolshoi.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d never seen a ballet.</p>
<p>I mean, I was not exactly steeped in high classical culture.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re kind of growing up in a mining region, you know, there&rsquo;s very limited</p>
<p>opportunities for this kind of thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d been in a youth orchestra and a youth choir.</p>
<p>My parents signed me up for absolutely everything, you know, they possibly could</p>
<p>education-wise, but it wasn&rsquo;t exactly any exposure to this.</p>
<p>So, you know, I was kind of astounded by the sort of wealth of the cultural experience</p>
<p>that one could have in Moscow.</p>
<p>But the main thing was I was really struck by how the Soviet Union was on its last</p>
<p>legs. Because this was Moscow, you know, I got this image about what it would look</p>
<p>like. I was quite, to be honest, terrified at first about what I would see there, you</p>
<p>know, the big nuclear superpower.</p>
<p>And since I got there, it was just this like as if a huge weight that I&rsquo;d been</p>
<p>carrying around for years in my teenage years just disappeared because it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>ordinary people in an ordinary place, not doing great.</p>
<p>This is the period of, you know, what they call deficitnei vremya, you know, the</p>
<p>period of deficits. But there was no food in the shops.</p>
<p>There was, you know, very little in terms of commodities because the supply and</p>
<p>demand parts of the economic equation were out of whack because it was total central</p>
<p>planning. You know, you&rsquo;d go into, you know, a shop that was supposed to sell boots</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;d be just one pair of boots all in the same size and the same color.</p>
<p>I actually lucked out because once I was in this Hungarian boot shop that was right</p>
<p>next to where my hall of residence was and I was looking for a new pair of boots and</p>
<p>every single pair of boots in the shop were my size and they were all women&rsquo;s boots</p>
<p>and not men&rsquo;s boots at all, you know, because there was been an oversupply of boots</p>
<p>and that size production.</p>
<p>But you could really kind of see here that there was something wrong.</p>
<p>And, you know, in the north of England, everything was closed down.</p>
<p>The shops were shuttered because there was no demand because everybody lost their</p>
<p>jobs. It was massive employment.</p>
<p>And when I went off to university in 1984, 90 percent youth unemployment in the UK,</p>
<p>meaning that when kids left school, they didn&rsquo;t have something else to go on to</p>
<p>unless they got to university or vocational training or an apprenticeship.</p>
<p>And most people were still looking, you know, kind of months out of leaving school.</p>
<p>And so shops were closing because people didn&rsquo;t have any money.</p>
<p>You know, I had 50 percent male unemployment in some of the towns as the steel works</p>
<p>closed down and the wagon works, the railways, for example, in my area.</p>
<p>But in Moscow, people in theory did have money, but there was just there was nothing</p>
<p>to buy. Also, the place was falling apart.</p>
<p>Literally, I saw massive sinkholes open up in the street, balconies fall off</p>
<p>buildings, you know, one accident after another.</p>
<p>And then there was, you know, this real kind of sense, even though the vibrancy and</p>
<p>excitement and hope of the Gorbachev period, a real sense of the Soviet Union has</p>
<p>lost its way. And of course, it was only a year or so after I left from that exchange</p>
<p>program and I&rsquo;d already started with my degree program in Soviet studies at Harvard</p>
<p>that the Soviet Union basically unraveled.</p>
<p>And it really did unravel.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like it collapsed.</p>
<p>It was basically that there was so many debates that Gorbachev had sparked off about</p>
<p>how to reform the country, how to put it on a different path that, you know, no one was</p>
<p>in agreement. And it was basically all these fights and debates and disputes among the</p>
<p>elites at the center, as well as, you know, basically a loss of faith in the system, in</p>
<p>the periphery and among the general population that in fact pulled it apart.</p>
<p>And of course, in 1991, you get Boris Yeltsin as the head of the Russian Federation, then</p>
<p>a constituent part of the Soviet Union, together with the presidents of Ukraine and</p>
<p>Belarus, all of these being individual parts of the Soviet Union getting together and</p>
<p>agreeing and essentially ending it.</p>
<p>And Gorbachev, you know, so basically I&rsquo;m there at the peak of this whole kind of</p>
<p>period of experimentation and thinking about the future.</p>
<p>And within a couple of years, it&rsquo;s all kind of gone and it&rsquo;s on a different track</p>
<p>entirely.</p>
<p>Well, I wonder if we reran the 20th century a thousand times, if how many times the</p>
<p>Soviet Union would collapse.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder about that, too.</p>
<p>And I also wonder about what would have happened if it didn&rsquo;t collapse and Gorbachev</p>
<p>had found a different direction.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, we see a very divisive time now in American history.</p>
<p>The United States of America has very different cultures, very different beliefs,</p>
<p>ideologies within those states.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s kind of the strength of America, there&rsquo;s these little laboratories of</p>
<p>ideas.</p>
<p>Until, though, that they don&rsquo;t keep together.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve had colleagues who have described what&rsquo;s happening in the West right</p>
<p>now as a kind of soft secession, with states, you know, going off in their own</p>
<p>direction.</p>
<p>In which states?</p>
<p>Well, these kinds of conceptions that we have now are divisions between red and blue</p>
<p>states because of the fracturing of our politics.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d always thought that that wouldn&rsquo;t be possible in somewhere like the United</p>
<p>States or many other countries as well, because there wasn&rsquo;t that ethnic dimension.</p>
<p>But in fact, many of the way that people talk about politics has given it that kind of</p>
<p>appearance in many respects.</p>
<p>Because, look, I mean, we know from the Soviet Union and the Soviet period and from</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re from, you know, originally in Ukraine, that language is not the main</p>
<p>signifier of identity and that identity can take all kinds of other forms.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, but there has to be a deep grievance of some kind.</p>
<p>If you took a poll in any of the states in the United States, I think a very small</p>
<p>minority of people would want to actually secede.</p>
<p>Even in Texas, where I spend a lot of my time.</p>
<p>I just I think that there is a common kind of pride of nation.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a lot of people complain about government and about how the</p>
<p>country is going, the way people complain about the weather when it&rsquo;s raining.</p>
<p>They say, oh, this stupid weather, it&rsquo;s raining again.</p>
<p>But really what they mean is we&rsquo;re in the smock together.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a together there.</p>
<p>I also feel that when I go around, I mean, I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time since I wrote my</p>
<p>book in last October and this last year going around, I find the same feeling.</p>
<p>But, you know, when I traveled around the Soviet Union back in the late 1980s, I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t get any kind of sense that people wanted to see the end of the Soviet Union</p>
<p>either. It was an elite project.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a really good book called Collapse by Vladislav Zubik, who is a professor at</p>
<p>London School of Economics at LSE.</p>
<p>And Zubik is pretty much my age and he&rsquo;s from the former Soviet Union, he&rsquo;s Russian.</p>
<p>And I mean, he describes it very quite aptly about how it was kind of the elites, you</p>
<p>know, that basically decided to pull the Soviet Union apart.</p>
<p>And there is a risk of that here as well when you get partisan politics and people</p>
<p>forgetting, you know, they&rsquo;re Americans and they are all in this together like a lot</p>
<p>of the population thing.</p>
<p>But they think that their own, you know, narrow partisan or ideological precepts, you</p>
<p>know, account for more.</p>
<p>And in the Soviet case, of course, it was also a power play, you know, in a way that</p>
<p>actually can&rsquo;t quite play out in the United States because it was the equivalent of</p>
<p>governors in many respects who got together, three of them, you know, in the case of</p>
<p>the heads of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, who then, you know, got rid of, you know,</p>
<p>basically the central figure of Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>
<p>It would be a little difficult to do that.</p>
<p>The dynamic is not the same.</p>
<p>But it does worry me of having seen all of that close up in the late 1980s and the</p>
<p>early 90s. I spent a lot of time in Russia as well as in Ukraine and Caucasus, Central</p>
<p>Asia and other places after the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>But you kind of see the same elite divisions here in the United States pulling in, you</p>
<p>know, in different directions and straining, you know, the overall body politic and the</p>
<p>way that national politics gets imposed on local politics in ways that it certainly</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t when I first came to the U.S.</p>
<p>in 1989. I didn&rsquo;t honestly, in 1989, when I first came here, I didn&rsquo;t know anybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>political affiliation.</p>
<p>I mean, I really knew their religious affiliation.</p>
<p>And, you know, obviously race was a was a major phenomenon here that was a shock to</p>
<p>me when I when I first came.</p>
<p>But many of the kind of the class, regional, geographic, you know, kind of political</p>
<p>dimensions that I&rsquo;ve seen in other places, I didn&rsquo;t see them at play in the same way</p>
<p>then as I do now.</p>
<p>And you take a lot of pride to this day of being nonpartisan.</p>
<p>That said, so you served for the George W.</p>
<p>Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump administrations, always specializing in</p>
<p>Eurasia and Russia.</p>
<p>You were the top presidential advisor to President, former President Donald Trump on</p>
<p>Russia and Europe, and famously testified in his first impeachment trial in 2019</p>
<p>saying, I take great pride in the fact that I&rsquo;m nonpartisan foreign policy expert.</p>
<p>So given that context, what does nonpartisan mean to you?</p>
<p>Well, it means being very careful about not putting any kind of ideological lens on</p>
<p>anything that I&rsquo;m analyzing or looking at or saying about foreign policy, for one</p>
<p>thing, but also not taking, you know, kind of one stance of one party over another</p>
<p>either. To be honest, I&rsquo;ve always found American politics somewhat confounding.</p>
<p>Because both the Democratic and the Republican Party are pretty big tents.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re coalitions.</p>
<p>You know, in Europe, it&rsquo;s actually kind of, in some respects, easier to navigate the</p>
<p>parameters of political parties because, you know, you have quite clear platforms.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s also a longer history in many respects, obviously.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a long history here in the United States of the development of the</p>
<p>parties, you know, going back to the late 18th century.</p>
<p>But in the United Kingdom, you know, for example, in the 20th century, the</p>
<p>development of the mass parties, you know, was quite easy to get a handle on.</p>
<p>You know, at one point in the UK, for example, the parties were real genuine mass</p>
<p>parties with people who were properly members and took part in regular meetings</p>
<p>and paid dues.</p>
<p>And, you know, it was easy to kind of see what they stood for.</p>
<p>And the same in Europe, you know, when you look at France and Germany and Western</p>
<p>Germany, of course, Italy and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Here in the United States, it&rsquo;s kind of pretty amorphous.</p>
<p>You know, the fact that you could kind of register, you know, randomly, it seems to</p>
<p>be a Democrat or Republican, like Trump did.</p>
<p>At one point he&rsquo;s a Democrat, next thing he&rsquo;s a Republican.</p>
<p>And then you kind of usurp a party apparatus.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t have to be, you&rsquo;re not vetted in any way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not kind of, you know, they don&rsquo;t check you out to see if you have</p>
<p>ideological coherence.</p>
<p>You know, you could have someone like Bernie Sanders on the other side, on the</p>
<p>left, you know, basically calling himself a socialist and running for the</p>
<p>Democratic presidential nomination.</p>
<p>So, you know, kind of in many respects, parties in the United States are much more</p>
<p>loose movements.</p>
<p>And I think you can, you know, it&rsquo;s almost like a kind of an a la carte menu of</p>
<p>different things and that people can pick apart, pick out.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s more over time, as I&rsquo;ve noticed, become more like a kind of an</p>
<p>affiliation even with the sporting team.</p>
<p>I mean, I get very shocked by the way that people say, well, I couldn&rsquo;t do this</p>
<p>because, you know, that&rsquo;s my side and I couldn&rsquo;t do anything and I couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>support someone for the other side.</p>
<p>I mean, I have a relative in my extended family here who is a, you know, died in</p>
<p>the war Republican and on, you know, family holiday, there was a book on their</p>
<p>table, said a hundred reasons for voting for a Democrat.</p>
<p>And I said, hey, are you thinking of shifting party affiliation?</p>
<p>Then I opened the book and it&rsquo;s blank.</p>
<p>It was pretty funny.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d laugh.</p>
<p>I thought, well, there you go.</p>
<p>Then, you know, there&rsquo;s just, there&rsquo;s no way that, you know, people can pull</p>
<p>themselves out of these frames.</p>
<p>So for me, it&rsquo;s very important to have that independence of thought.</p>
<p>I think you can be politically engaged on the issues, but, you know, basically</p>
<p>without taking a stance that&rsquo;s defined by some ideology or some sense of</p>
<p>kind of partisan affiliation.</p>
<p>I think I tweeted about this, maybe not eloquently in the statement, if I</p>
<p>remember correctly, was something like, if you honestly can&rsquo;t find a good thing</p>
<p>that Donald Trump did, or a good thing that Joe Biden did, you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not thinking about ideas.</p>
<p>You just pick the tribe.</p>
<p>I mean, it was more eloquent than that, but it was, it was, it&rsquo;s basically, this</p>
<p>is a really good test to see, are you actually thinking about like how to solve</p>
<p>problems versus like your red team or blue team, like a sporting team?</p>
<p>Can you find a good idea of Donald Trump&rsquo;s that you like, if you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>who is against Donald Trump and like acknowledge it to yourself privately?</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad he said that.</p>
<p>Or he&rsquo;s even asking the right kinds of questions, which he often did actually.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously he put them in a way that most of us wouldn&rsquo;t have done, but</p>
<p>there was often kind of questions about why is this happening?</p>
<p>Why are we doing this?</p>
<p>And, you know, we have to challenge ourselves all the time.</p>
<p>So yeah, actually, why are we doing that?</p>
<p>And then you have to really inspect it and say whether it&rsquo;s actually worth</p>
<p>continuing that way, or they should be doing something differently.</p>
<p>Now he had a more kind of destructive quality to those kinds of questions, you</p>
<p>know, maybe it&rsquo;s the real estate developer in him that was, you know,</p>
<p>taking a big wrecking ball to all of these kinds of, you know, sacred</p>
<p>edifices and things like that.</p>
<p>But often, if you really paid attention, he was asking a valid set of questions</p>
<p>about why do we continue to do things like this?</p>
<p>Now, we didn&rsquo;t often have answers about what he was going to do in response, but</p>
<p>those questions still had to be asked and we shouldn&rsquo;t be just rejecting them, you</p>
<p>know, out of turn.</p>
<p>And, you know, another strength, the thing that people often that criticize Donald</p>
<p>Trump will say is a weakness, is his lack of civility can be a strength, because I</p>
<p>feel like sometimes bureaucracy functions on excessive civility.</p>
<p>Like, actually, I&rsquo;ve seen this, it&rsquo;s not just, it&rsquo;s bureaucracy in all forms.</p>
<p>Like in tech companies, as they grow, everybody kind of, you know, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting a pretty good salary, everyone&rsquo;s, everyone&rsquo;s comfortable, and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>meeting and you discuss how to move stuff forward.</p>
<p>And like, you don&rsquo;t want to be the asshole in the room that says, why, this</p>
<p>is, why are we doing this, this way?</p>
<p>This is, this could be unethical.</p>
<p>This is hurting the world.</p>
<p>This is totally a dumb idea.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, I could give specific examples that I have on my mind</p>
<p>currently that are technical, but the point is oftentimes the person that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>needed in that room is an asshole.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Steve Jobs worked.</p>
<p>So Elon Musk works, you have to roll in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what first principles thinking looks like.</p>
<p>The one bit when it doesn&rsquo;t work is when they start name calling, you know, kind</p>
<p>of inciting violence against, you know, the people that they disagree with.</p>
<p>So that was kind of your problem, because I mean, often when, you know, when I was</p>
<p>in the administration, I had all of Europe in my portfolio as well as Russia.</p>
<p>And there were many times when, you know, we were dealing with our European</p>
<p>colleagues where he was asking some pretty valid questions about, well, why</p>
<p>should we do this if you&rsquo;re doing that?</p>
<p>You know, for example, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, the United States has been</p>
<p>opposed to Europe&rsquo;s reliance on gas and oil exports from Russia, you know, the</p>
<p>Soviet Union since the 70s and 80s.</p>
<p>And Trump kept pushing this idea about, so why are we spending so much money on</p>
<p>NATO and NATO defense?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re all talking about this.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re then, you know, basically paying billions, you know, to Russia for</p>
<p>gas, isn&rsquo;t this, you know, contradictory?</p>
<p>And of course it was, but it was the way that he did it.</p>
<p>And I actually, you know, one instance had a discussion with a European defense</p>
<p>minister who basically said to me, look, he&rsquo;s saying exactly the same things as</p>
<p>people said before him, including, you know, former Defense Secretary Gates.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the way he says it, you know, so they took offense.</p>
<p>And then as a result of that, they wouldn&rsquo;t take action because they</p>
<p>took offense at what he said.</p>
<p>So it was a kind of then a way of, could you find some other means of, you know,</p>
<p>massaging this communication to kind of make it effective, which we would always</p>
<p>try to focus on because it&rsquo;s a kind of, it was the delivery, but the actual</p>
<p>message was often spot on in those kinds of issues.</p>
<p>I mean, he was actually highlighting, you know, these ridiculous discrepancies</p>
<p>between what people said and what they actually did.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the delivery, the charisma in the room too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also understanding the power of that, of a leader.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about what you do at a podium, but in a room with advisors, how</p>
<p>you talk about stuff, how you convince other leaders.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t do it through gratuitous insults and incitement to violence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the things you just, you don&rsquo;t get anywhere on that front.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Tough measures and maximum pressure often does work because there were, you know,</p>
<p>oftentimes where, you know, that kind of relentless, you know, nagging about</p>
<p>something or constantly raising it actually did have results where it</p>
<p>hadn&rsquo;t previously, so there&rsquo;s, you know, the maximum pressure, if it, you know,</p>
<p>kind of kept on it in the right way.</p>
<p>And, you know, often when we were coming in behind on pushing on issues, you</p>
<p>know, related to NATO or, you know, other things in this same sphere, it</p>
<p>would actually have an effect.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t get talked about because it gets overshadowed by, you know, all</p>
<p>of the other kind of stuff around this.</p>
<p>And the way that, you know, he interacted with people and treated people.</p>
<p>What was the heart, the key insights to your testimony in that impeachment?</p>
<p>Look, I think there is a straight line between that whole series of episodes</p>
<p>and the current war in Ukraine, because Vladimir Putin and the people around</p>
<p>him in the Kremlin concluded that the U.S.</p>
<p>did not care one little bit about Ukraine.</p>
<p>And it was just a game.</p>
<p>For Trump, it was personal game.</p>
<p>He was basically trying to get Volodymyr Zelensky to do him a personal favor</p>
<p>related to his desire to stay on in power in the 2020 election.</p>
<p>And generally, they just thought that we were using Ukraine as some kind of</p>
<p>proxy or some kind of instrument within our own domestic politics,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what it looked like.</p>
<p>And I think that, you know, as a result of that, Putin, you know, took the</p>
<p>idea away that he could do whatever he wanted.</p>
<p>We were constantly being asked, even prior to this, by people around</p>
<p>Putin, like Nikolai Patrushev, the head of the National Security Council</p>
<p>equivalent in Russia, who we met with frequently, what&rsquo;s Ukraine to you?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>You know, why do you even care?</p>
<p>So they thought that we weren&rsquo;t serious, that we weren&rsquo;t serious about</p>
<p>Ukraine&rsquo;s territorial integrity and its independence, or it is a national</p>
<p>security player.</p>
<p>And Putin also thought that he could just manipulate the political space in</p>
<p>the United States.</p>
<p>Actually, he could, because what he was doing was seeding all this dissent</p>
<p>and fueling, you know, already in a debate inside of US politics, the kinds</p>
<p>of things that we see just kind of coming out now.</p>
<p>This kind of idea that Ukraine was a burden, that Ukraine was basically just</p>
<p>trying to extract things from the United States, that Ukraine had somehow</p>
<p>played inside of US politics.</p>
<p>Trump was convinced that the Ukrainians had done something against him, that</p>
<p>they had intervened in the elections.</p>
<p>And that was kind of, you know, a combination of people around him trying</p>
<p>to find excuses to, you know, kind of what had happened in the election to</p>
<p>kind of divert attention away from Russia&rsquo;s interference in 2016, and the</p>
<p>Russians themselves poisoning the well against Ukraine.</p>
<p>So you had a kind of a confluence of circumstances there.</p>
<p>And what I was trying to get across in that testimony was the national</p>
<p>security imperative of basically getting our act together here and</p>
<p>separating out what was going on in our domestic politics from what was</p>
<p>happening in our national security and foreign policy.</p>
<p>I mean, I think we contributed in that whole mess around the impeachment, but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the whole parallel policies around Ukraine to the war that we now</p>
<p>have that we&rsquo;re confronting.</p>
<p>Yes, signaling the value we place in peace and stability in that part of the</p>
<p>world, or the reverse by saying we don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Yeah, we seem to not care.</p>
<p>It was just a game.</p>
<p>But I mean, the US role in that war is a very complicated one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the variables.</p>
<p>Just on that testimony, did it in part break your heart that you had to</p>
<p>testify essentially against the president of the United States?</p>
<p>Or is that not how you saw it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I would describe it in that way.</p>
<p>I think what I was was deeply disappointed by what I saw happening in</p>
<p>the American political space.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect it.</p>
<p>Look, I was a starry-eyed immigrant.</p>
<p>I came to the United States with all of these expectations of what the place</p>
<p>would be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d already been disabused of some of the, let&rsquo;s just say, rosy perspectives</p>
<p>that I held in the United States.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d been shocked by the depths of racial problems.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t even sum up the problems we have in the United States.</p>
<p>I mean, I couldn&rsquo;t get my head around it when I first came.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;d read about slavery in American history, but I hadn&rsquo;t fully</p>
<p>fathomed really the kind of the way that it was ripping apart the United States.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;d read Alexis de Tocqueville, and he&rsquo;d commented on this, and it</p>
<p>obviously hadn&rsquo;t kind of changed to the way that one would have expected all</p>
<p>this time from the 18th century onwards.</p>
<p>So that was kind of one thing that I realized the civil rights movement and</p>
<p>all of these acts of expansion of suffrage and everything else were imperfect at</p>
<p>best.</p>
<p>And I was born in 65, the same time as the Civil Rights Act, and there&rsquo;s a heck</p>
<p>of a long way still to go.</p>
<p>So I wasn&rsquo;t, let&rsquo;s just say, as starry-eyed about everything as I&rsquo;d been</p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>But I really saw an incredible competence and professionalism in the U.S.</p>
<p>government, in the election system and the integrity of it.</p>
<p>And I mean, I really saw that.</p>
<p>I saw that the United States was the gold standard for some of its institutions.</p>
<p>And I worked in the National Intelligence Council, and I&rsquo;d seen the way that the</p>
<p>United States had tried to address the problems that it had faced in this whole</p>
<p>botched analysis of Iraq and this terrible strategic blunder of, honestly,</p>
<p>a crime in my view of invading Iraq.</p>
<p>But the way that people were trying to deal with that in the aftermath.</p>
<p>I mean, I went into the National Intelligence Council and the DNI, the</p>
<p>Office of the Director of National Intelligence, when they were coming to</p>
<p>terms with what had gone wrong in the whole analysis about Iraq in 2003, you</p>
<p>know, in the whole wake of people trying to pull together after 9-11 and to learn</p>
<p>all of the lessons from all of this.</p>
<p>And I saw, you know, just really genuine striving and deliberation about what had</p>
<p>gone wrong, what lessons could we learn from this?</p>
<p>And then suddenly, I found myself in this, I couldn&rsquo;t really describe it in any</p>
<p>words, just totally crazy looking glass, thinking of, you know, Alice in</p>
<p>Wonderland, Alice through the Looking Glass version of American politics.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;d seen everything starting to unravel over a kind of a period of time</p>
<p>before I&rsquo;d been asked to be in the administration, but I did not expect it</p>
<p>to be that bad, I honestly didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;d been warned, you know, by people that this was, you know, kind of</p>
<p>really a very serious turn that the United States had taken.</p>
<p>But I really thought that national security would still be uppermost in</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s minds. And it was, I mean, a lot of the people that I work with.</p>
<p>But what I found, you know, if you want to use that, you know, term of</p>
<p>heartbreaking, was the way in which all of these principles that I had really</p>
<p>bought into and tried to uphold in the United States government and in the</p>
<p>things that we were trying to do with me and my colleagues was just being thrown</p>
<p>out the window. And, you know, I would have to step up in defence of them and</p>
<p>in defence of my colleagues who were being lambasted and, you know, criticised</p>
<p>and given death threats for actually standing up and doing their own jobs.</p>
<p>In particular on the topic of Ukraine?</p>
<p>Not just on Ukraine, but on national security overall.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I&rsquo;d gone through this whole period even before we got to that point</p>
<p>and seeing non-partisan government officials being attacked from all sides,</p>
<p>left and right, but especially the right, and being basically accused of being</p>
<p>partisan hacks, you know, deep state coup plotters, you know, you name it.</p>
<p>There, patriotism being questioned as well.</p>
<p>And a lot of people I work with in government, like myself, naturalised</p>
<p>Americans, a lot of them were immigrants, many were refugees and many people had</p>
<p>fought in wars on behalf of the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan, being</p>
<p>blown up. And, you know, they put their lives on the line.</p>
<p>They put their family lives on the line, you know, because they believed in</p>
<p>America. And they were just, they were reflections of Americans from all kinds</p>
<p>of walks of life. It&rsquo;s what really made, you know, that clich√© of America great.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t, you know, whatever it was that was being bandied around in these crude,</p>
<p>crass political terms.</p>
<p>It was just the strength of an incredible set of people who&rsquo;ve come together from</p>
<p>all kinds of places and decided that they&rsquo;re going to make a go of it and that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to, you know, try to work towards the whole idea of the preamble of</p>
<p>the Constitution towards a more perfect union.</p>
<p>And I, you know, I saw people doing that every single day, despite all of the</p>
<p>things that they could criticise about the United States, still believing in what</p>
<p>they were doing and believing in the promise of the country, which is what I</p>
<p>felt like. And then here we were, people were just treating it like a game and</p>
<p>they were treating people like dirt and they were just playing games with people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>lives. I mean, we all had death threats, you know, people&rsquo;s, you know, whole</p>
<p>careers, which were not just careers for their own self-aggrandisement, but</p>
<p>careers of public service, trying to give something back, were being shattered.</p>
<p>And I found, you know, I just thought to myself, I&rsquo;m not going to let that happen</p>
<p>because, you know, I&rsquo;ve come from a, well, are they going to send me back to</p>
<p>Bishop Auckland in County Durham?</p>
<p>Fine. I&rsquo;m totally fine to go back, you know, because I could do something back</p>
<p>there. But I&rsquo;m not going to let this happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made this choice to come to America.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all in. And these guys are just behaving like a bunch of idiots and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>ruining it, you know, they&rsquo;re ruining it for everybody.</p>
<p>So the personal attacks on incompetent, hardworking, passionate people who have</p>
<p>love for what they do in their heart, similar stuff I&rsquo;ve seen for virologists</p>
<p>and biologists, so colleagues, basically scientists in the time of COVID when</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of cynicism and there was just personal attacks, including death</p>
<p>threats on people that, you know, work on viruses, work on vaccines.</p>
<p>Yeah, and they&rsquo;re going around in, you know, basically with protective gear on</p>
<p>in case somebody shoots them in the street.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just absurd.</p>
<p>But let me zoom out from the individual people and actually look at the</p>
<p>situations that we saw in the George W.</p>
<p>Bush, Obama and Donald Trump presidencies.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to sort of criticise each by not the treatment of individual people,</p>
<p>but by the results.</p>
<p>Right. Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>So if we look at George W.</p>
<p>Bush, and maybe you can give me insights, this is what&rsquo;s fascinating to me.</p>
<p>When you have extremely competent, smart, hardworking, well-intentioned people, how</p>
<p>do we, as a system, make mistakes in foreign policy?</p>
<p>So the big mistake you can characterise in different ways, but in George W.</p>
<p>Bush is invading Iraq, or maybe how it was invaded, or maybe how the decision</p>
<p>process was made to invade it.</p>
<p>Again, Afghanistan, maybe not the invasion, but details around like having a plan</p>
<p>about, you know, how to withdraw, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Barack Obama, to me, similarly, is a man who came to fame early on for being</p>
<p>somebody who was against, a rare voice against the invasion of Iraq, which was</p>
<p>actually a brave thing to do at that time.</p>
<p>And nevertheless, he, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know the numbers, but I think he was the</p>
<p>president for years over increased drone attacks, like everything from a foreign</p>
<p>policy perspective, the military-industrial complex, that machine grew in power under</p>
<p>him, not shrunk, and did not withdraw from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>And then with Donald Trump, the criticisms that you&rsquo;re presenting, sort of the</p>
<p>personal attacks, the chaos, the partisanship of people that are supposed to be</p>
<p>non-partisan. So that, you know, if you sort of the steel man, the chaos, to make</p>
<p>the case for chaos, maybe we need to shake up the machine, throw a wrench into the</p>
<p>engine, into the gears.</p>
<p>And then every individual gear is going to be very upset with that because it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>wrench. It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s an inefficient process, but maybe it leads for government.</p>
<p>It forces the system as a whole, not the individuals, but the system to reconsider how</p>
<p>things are done. So obviously all of those things, the actual results are not that</p>
<p>impressive.</p>
<p>You could have done that on the latter, you know, shaking things up, because I&rsquo;m all one</p>
<p>for questioning and trying to shake things up as well and do things differently.</p>
<p>But, you know, the question is, if you bring the whole system down with nothing, ideas of</p>
<p>putting it to place. Look, I mean, like many people, I&rsquo;ve studied the Bolshevik</p>
<p>Revolution and, you know, many others as well.</p>
<p>And, you know, kind of what&rsquo;s, you know, what&rsquo;s the pattern here, you know, that</p>
<p>actually fits into what you&rsquo;re talking about here is a kind of rigidity of thought on the</p>
<p>part of revolutionaries in many cases as well.</p>
<p>And also narcissism.</p>
<p>In fact, I think it takes a pretty strong sense of yourself, you know, kind of an own</p>
<p>yourself to want to be president of the United States, for example.</p>
<p>We see that in, you know, many of our presidents have been narcissists to different, you</p>
<p>know, kind of degrees.</p>
<p>You think about Lenin, you know, for example, and people can go back and read about</p>
<p>Lenin. He formed his views when he was about 18 and he never shook them off.</p>
<p>He never evolved.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have any kind of diversity of thought.</p>
<p>And when systems go awry, it&rsquo;s when they don&rsquo;t bring in different perspectives.</p>
<p>And so, you know, Trump, if he brought in different perspectives and actually listened</p>
<p>to them and not just, you know, believed that he himself knew better than anyone else and</p>
<p>then tried to divide everybody against each other, it would have been a different</p>
<p>matter. It&rsquo;s a tragedy of a completely and utterly lost set of opportunities because of</p>
<p>the flaws in his own nature.</p>
<p>Because, I mean, again, there was all kinds of things that he could have done to shake</p>
<p>things up. And so many people around him remained completely disappointed.</p>
<p>And of course, he divided and pitted people against each other, you know, creating so</p>
<p>much factionalism in American politics that, you know, people have forgotten they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Americans. They think that they&rsquo;re red or blue, you know, parts of teams.</p>
<p>And, you know, if you go back over history, that&rsquo;s kind of a recipe for the war and, you</p>
<p>know, internal conflict. You go back to, you know, the Byzantine Empire, for example,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the famous episode of the Nike riots in Constantinople where the whole city gets</p>
<p>trashed because the greens, the reds, the blues and these various sporting teams in the</p>
<p>Hippodrome get whipped up by political forces and they pull the place apart.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know, kind of where we&rsquo;ve been heading on some of these trajectories.</p>
<p>But the other point is when you look back, you know, Bush and Obama as well, there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>very narrow circle of decision making.</p>
<p>You know, in Bush period, it&rsquo;s the focus on the executive branch with Dick Cheney as the</p>
<p>vice president being very fixated on it.</p>
<p>And Obama, it&rsquo;s, you know, he and, you know, kind of the bright young things around him,</p>
<p>you know, from he himself is, you know, kind of intellectually, you know, one might say</p>
<p>arrogant in many respects.</p>
<p>You know, he was a very smart guy and, you know, he&rsquo;s convinced that he has and he</p>
<p>ruminates over a lot of things.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s the person who makes, you know, a lot of decisions.</p>
<p>And basically, George W.</p>
<p>Bush used to call himself the decider as well, right?</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re all the people who make the decisions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always as consultative as you might think it is.</p>
<p>And for Trump, it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m not listening to anybody at all.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s just me and whatever it is that I&rsquo;ve woken up today and I&rsquo;ve decided to</p>
<p>do. So I think, you know, the problem with all of our systems, why we don&rsquo;t get results</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t draw upon, you know, the diversity of opinion and all the ideas of</p>
<p>people out there. You do that in science.</p>
<p>I mean, when I mean, all of my friends and relatives are in science, they&rsquo;ve got these</p>
<p>incredible collaborations with people, you know, across the world.</p>
<p>I mean, how did we get to these vaccines for the COVID virus?</p>
<p>Because of this incredible years of collaboration and of, you know, sharing results</p>
<p>and sharing ideas. And our whole system has become ossified.</p>
<p>You know, we think about the congressional system, for example, as well.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, you know, this kind of rapid turnover that you have in Congress every two</p>
<p>years. You know, there&rsquo;s no incentive for people, you know, basically to work with others.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re constantly campaigning.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re constantly trying to appeal to whatever their base is.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t really care about, you know, some do, you know, of their constituents.</p>
<p>But a lot of people don&rsquo;t. And the Senate, it&rsquo;s all kind of focused on the game of</p>
<p>legislation for so many people as well.</p>
<p>Not focusing again on that kind of sense about what are we doing like scientists to kind</p>
<p>of work together, you know, for the good of the country to push things along.</p>
<p>And also our government also is siloed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a lot of mechanisms for bringing people together.</p>
<p>There ought to be. And things like the National Security Council, the National Intelligence</p>
<p>Council actually did that quite successfully at times for analysis that I saw.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t have, you know, we have it within the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>But we saw the CDC break down on this, you know, kind of front.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have sufficient of those institutions that bring people together from all kinds</p>
<p>of different backgrounds.</p>
<p>You know, one of the other problems that we have with government, with the federal</p>
<p>government over, you know, state and local government, is actually quite small.</p>
<p>People think that the federal government&rsquo;s huge because we have postal service and the</p>
<p>military that are part of it.</p>
<p>But your actual federal government employees is a very small number.</p>
<p>And, you know, the senior executive service part of that is the older white guys, you</p>
<p>know, who kind of come up all the way over the last several decades.</p>
<p>We have a really hard time bringing in younger people into that kind of government</p>
<p>service, unless they&rsquo;re political hacks, you know, and they want to, you know, kind of</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re kind of looking for power and, you know, sort of influence.</p>
<p>We have a hard time getting people like yourself and other, you know, younger people</p>
<p>kind of coming in to make a career out of public service and also retaining them.</p>
<p>Because, you know, people with incredible skills often get poached away into the</p>
<p>private sector. And, you know, a lot of the people that I work with on the national</p>
<p>security side are now at all kinds of, you know, high end political consultancies or</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve gone to Silicon Valley and they&rsquo;ve gone to this place and that place.</p>
<p>Because after a time as a younger person, they&rsquo;re not rising up particularly quickly</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a pretty rigid way of looking at the hierarchies and the promotion</p>
<p>schemes. And they&rsquo;re also getting lambasted by everybody.</p>
<p>People like, you know, public servants, they&rsquo;re not really public servants.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this whole lack and loss of a kind of a faith in public service.</p>
<p>And, you know, the last few years have really done a lot of damage.</p>
<p>We need to revitalise our government system to get better results.</p>
<p>We need to bring more people in, even if it&rsquo;s, you know, for a period of time, not just</p>
<p>through expensive contracts for, you know, the big consulting companies and, you know,</p>
<p>other entities that do government work out there, but getting people in for a period of</p>
<p>time, expanding some of these management fellowships and the White House</p>
<p>fellows and, you know, bringing in, you know, scientists, you know, from the outside,</p>
<p>giving, you know, that kind of opportunity for collaboration that we see in other spheres.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s actually one of the biggest roles for a president that for some reason</p>
<p>during the election that&rsquo;s never talked about is how good are you at hiring and creating</p>
<p>a culture of, like, attracting the right, I mean, basically chief hire.</p>
<p>When you think of a CEO, like the great CEOs are, I mean, maybe people don&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about it that often, but they do more often for CEOs than they do for presidents, is</p>
<p>like, how good are you at building a team?</p>
<p>Well, we make it really difficult because of the political process.</p>
<p>I mean, and also because we have so many political appointments, we ought to have</p>
<p>less, to be honest.</p>
<p>I mean, if you look at other governments around the world, you know, that are</p>
<p>smaller, it&rsquo;s much easier for them to hire people in.</p>
<p>You know, some of the most successful governments are much smaller.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not that I say that, you know, the government is necessarily too big, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just thinking about each unit in a different way.</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t be having so many political appointments.</p>
<p>We should kind of find more professional appointments, more non-partisan</p>
<p>appointments, because, you know, every single administration that we&rsquo;ve had over</p>
<p>the last, let&rsquo;s see, span of presidencies, they have jobs that are unfulfilled.</p>
<p>Because they can&rsquo;t get their candidates through Congress and the Senate because</p>
<p>of all the kind of political games that are being played.</p>
<p>I know loads of people have just been held up because it&rsquo;s just on the whim of, you</p>
<p>know, some member of Congress, even though that the actual position that they want</p>
<p>is really technical and doesn&rsquo;t really care about what, you know, what political</p>
<p>preference they particularly have.</p>
<p>So I think we have to try to look at the whole system of governments in the way</p>
<p>that we would over, you know, other professional sectors.</p>
<p>And to try to think about this as, just as you said there, that this is a government</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually running our country.</p>
<p>This is an operating system and you wouldn&rsquo;t operate it like that if you were, you</p>
<p>know, looking at it in any kind of rational way.</p>
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t be so ideologically or partisan tainted.</p>
<p>At every level anyway.</p>
<p>So I would actually just make a bid for a more non-partisan approach to a lot of the</p>
<p>parts of government.</p>
<p>You can still kind of bring in, you know, the political and premature, but also you</p>
<p>have to explain to people writ large in America as well, that this is your</p>
<p>government and that actually you could also be part of this.</p>
<p>You know, things like the Small Business Administration, the US Department of</p>
<p>Agriculture, you know, all these kinds of things that actually people interact with,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t even know it.</p>
<p>The Postal Service, you know, all of these things.</p>
<p>I mean, people actually, when you ask them about different functions of government,</p>
<p>they have a lot of support for it.</p>
<p>The National Park Service, you know, for example, it&rsquo;s just when you talk about</p>
<p>government in an abstract way, like, oh, too much bloated, you know, not efficient</p>
<p>and effective.</p>
<p>But if you kind of bring it down more to the kind of local and federal levels, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of, you know, when people really see it, if people could see kind of themselves</p>
<p>reflected, and many of the people have gone into public service, I think that they</p>
<p>would have a lot more support for it.</p>
<p>More like superstars, like individuals that are like big on social media, big in the</p>
<p>public eye and having fun with it and showing cool stuff that it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Because right now, a lot of people see government as basically partisan warfare.</p>
<p>And then it just, it makes it unpleasant to do the job.</p>
<p>It makes it uninspiring for people looking in from outside about what&rsquo;s going on inside</p>
<p>government, all of it, the whole thing.</p>
<p>But you are, you know, just with all due respect, you&rsquo;re a pretty rare individual in</p>
<p>terms of non-partisanship.</p>
<p>Actually, your whole life story, the humbling aspect of your upbringing and everything</p>
<p>like that. Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to have a lot of non-partisan experts in</p>
<p>government? Like, can you be a top presidential advisor on Russia for 10 years, for</p>
<p>15 years, and remain non-partisan?</p>
<p>I think you can.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s advisable, though, by the way, because I mean, I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>anybody should be there, you know, for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>So your first advice is to fire yourself after 10 years?</p>
<p>Well, you should definitely have term limits, just like you should in everything,</p>
<p>right? I mean, it&rsquo;s just like tenure in university.</p>
<p>Well, we all have term limits.</p>
<p>Yeah, you kind of, you know, we do, we have natural term limits.</p>
<p>But, you know, you&rsquo;re kind of, you know, basically bottling it up for other people.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, what I&rsquo;m trying to do now, I&rsquo;m 57 now, and I always try to work</p>
<p>with, you know, people from different generations to me, just like, you know, I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>really benefited from these, you know, kind of mentorships of people older, you can,</p>
<p>you know, mentor up and well and mentor down.</p>
<p>I mean, I would, you know, try to get people from different backgrounds and different</p>
<p>generations to work together in teams.</p>
<p>Honestly, I&rsquo;d like to more team networked kind of approach to things, the kind of</p>
<p>things that you get again in science, right?</p>
<p>I mean, all these ideas are going to come from all kinds of different perspectives.</p>
<p>Age and experience does count for something, but, you know, fresh ideas and coming in</p>
<p>and looking at a problem from a different perspective and seeing something that</p>
<p>somebody else hasn&rsquo;t seen before.</p>
<p>I mean, I just, you know, kind of love working in an environment with all kinds of</p>
<p>different people and people who don&rsquo;t agree with you.</p>
<p>You need people to take you on and say, absolutely, that&rsquo;s crap.</p>
<p>You know, kind of, where did you come up with that from?</p>
<p>And you go, hang on.</p>
<p>Well, explain to me why you think so.</p>
<p>And then, you know, you have this kind of iterative process back and forth.</p>
<p>I mean, I would always encourage my colleagues to tell me when they thought it</p>
<p>was wrong.</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes I didn&rsquo;t agree because I didn&rsquo;t see the, you know, the reasoning.</p>
<p>But other times I&rsquo;d be like, they&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>You know, that was a complete mistake.</p>
<p>I need to admit that.</p>
<p>And, you know, kind of, we need to figure out a different way of doing things.</p>
<p>But the one point I do want to get across is there were a lot of people who were</p>
<p>nonpartisan that I worked with.</p>
<p>I mean, honestly, in most of the jobs that I had up until more recently, I had no idea</p>
<p>about people&rsquo;s political affiliation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just when you get into this kind of highly charged partisan environment, they</p>
<p>kind of force people, you know, to make decisions.</p>
<p>And when you have, you know, one political party or political faction that&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>usurp power, it does make it quite difficult.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the situation that we&rsquo;re in right now.</p>
<p>And, you know, we&rsquo;re seeing some of the things happening in the United States I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen and studied in other settings or seen for myself happening.</p>
<p>You know, when you have a president who wants to cling on to power, you know, you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got to call that out.</p>
<p>You know, is that a partisan act or is that a kind of, you know, defense of that larger</p>
<p>political system that you&rsquo;re part of?</p>
<p>You know, so I think we&rsquo;ve got to recognize that even if you&rsquo;re not partisan, you can be</p>
<p>politically engaged.</p>
<p>And, you know, sometimes you just have to stand up there and speak out, which is, you</p>
<p>know, what I did and what others did as well.</p>
<p>None of those people who spoke out, you know, can initially saw that as a partisan act,</p>
<p>even if some of them since then have decided to make political choices they hadn&rsquo;t made</p>
<p>before, because, you know, the situation actually forced people into, you know, taking</p>
<p>sides. It&rsquo;s very hard to still stay above the fray when you&rsquo;ve got, you know, someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s trying to perpetrate a coup.</p>
<p>Yeah, just to linger on that, I think it&rsquo;s hard and it&rsquo;s the courageous thing to do to</p>
<p>criticize a president and not fall into partisanship after.</p>
<p>Because the whole world will assume if you criticize Donald Trump, that you&rsquo;re clearly a</p>
<p>Democrat. And so they will just, everybody will criticize you for being a Democrat.</p>
<p>And then so you&rsquo;re now stuck in that.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to just embrace that role.</p>
<p>But to still walk the nonpartisan route after the criticism, that&rsquo;s the hard road.</p>
<p>So not let the criticisms break you into, you know, into a certain kind of ideological</p>
<p>set of positions.</p>
<p>I mean, our political system needs revitalization.</p>
<p>We need to be taking a long, hard look at ourselves here.</p>
<p>And I think what people are calling out for, look, there&rsquo;s a vast swath of the population,</p>
<p>like me, who are unaffiliated.</p>
<p>You know, maybe some lean in one direction over another.</p>
<p>And unaffiliated doesn&rsquo;t mean you don&rsquo;t have views about things and political opinions.</p>
<p>And, you know, you may sound quite extreme on some of those, you know, either from a</p>
<p>left or right perspective.</p>
<p>What people are looking for is a kind of an articulation of things in a kind of a clear</p>
<p>way that they can get a handle on.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re also looking for a representation.</p>
<p>Somebody is going to be there, you know, for you, you know, not part of a kind of a rigid</p>
<p>team that you&rsquo;re excluded from.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the ins and the outs.</p>
<p>But what people are looking at now, they&rsquo;re looking at that in the workplace because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not finding that in politics.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually getting workers, you know, pushing the people talk about the rise of</p>
<p>the workers, people just saying, hang on a sec, you know, the most important space that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in right now is my workplace because that&rsquo;s where my benefits are from.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not coming from the state.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a peculiarity of the United States system.</p>
<p>You know, in Britain, you&rsquo;ve got the National Health Service and you&rsquo;ve got all the kind</p>
<p>of national wide benefits.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re not tethered to your employer like you are in the United States.</p>
<p>But here now we&rsquo;re asking people, you know, people are pushing for more representation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re asking to be represented within their workplace.</p>
<p>Be it Starbucks, where baristas, you know, and other Starbucks employees are trying to</p>
<p>unionize.</p>
<p>We have unions among our research assistants, the Brookings Institution where I am, you</p>
<p>know, kind of teaching assistants and big universities doing the same kind of thing</p>
<p>as well, because they want to have their voice heard.</p>
<p>They want to kind of play a larger role and they want to have change.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re often pushing their companies or the institutions they work for to make</p>
<p>that change because they don&rsquo;t see it happening in the political sphere.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just enough to go out there and protest in the street.</p>
<p>But if you want something to happen, that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re seeing big corporations playing</p>
<p>a bigger role as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, and of course, there&rsquo;s, you know, there&rsquo;s a longer discussion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also criticisms of the mechanisms of unions to achieve the giving of a voice</p>
<p>to people.</p>
<p>This goes back to my own experience growing up in northern England.</p>
<p>The Durham miners that I was part of for generations, you know, first person in my</p>
<p>family, not in the mines, on my dad&rsquo;s side, they created their own association.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a union per se at the very beginning.</p>
<p>Later, they became part of the National Miners Union.</p>
<p>They lost their autonomy and independence as a result of that.</p>
<p>But what they did was they pooled their resources.</p>
<p>They set up their own parliament so they could all get together.</p>
<p>Literally, they built a parliament and it opened in the same time as World War One and</p>
<p>where they all got together because they didn&rsquo;t have the vote.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have suffrage at the time because they didn&rsquo;t have any money, you know, so</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t pay the tax and they couldn&rsquo;t run for parliament.</p>
<p>And this is, you know, the kind of the origins of the organised labour parties later.</p>
<p>But they create this association so they could talk about how they could deal with things</p>
<p>of their own communities and have a voice in the things that mattered.</p>
<p>You know, education, you know, improving their work conditions.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like what you think about some kind of like big political trade union with,</p>
<p>you know, left wing, you know, kind of ideas.</p>
<p>In fact, they actually tried to root out later after the Bolshevik revolution in the</p>
<p>Soviet Union, even when they were still having ties with places like the mines of Don</p>
<p>Bass in the 1920s, Trotskyites and, you know, kind of Leninists and, you know, communists.</p>
<p>They were more focused on how to improve their own well-being, you know, what they</p>
<p>called the welfare. They had some welfare societies where they were kind of trying to</p>
<p>think. And that&rsquo;s kind of what baristas in Starbucks want, or workers in Amazon.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking about their own well-being.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about pay and work conditions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about what it means to be part of this larger entity, because you&rsquo;re not feeling</p>
<p>that same kind of connection to politics, you know, at the moment, because, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re being told by a representative, sorry, I don&rsquo;t represent you because you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>vote for me. You know, if you&rsquo;re not a Democrat, you&rsquo;re not a Republican, you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>red, you know, you&rsquo;re not blue, you&rsquo;re not mine.</p>
<p>And so people are saying, well, I&rsquo;m in this workplace, this is kind of my collective.</p>
<p>You know, this is, this is, you know, therefore, this is what I&rsquo;m going to have to try</p>
<p>to push to make change. So I mean, this is kind of happening here.</p>
<p>And we have to, you know, realize that, you know, we&rsquo;ve kind of gone in a way full</p>
<p>circle back to that, you know, kind of period of the early emergence of sort of mass</p>
<p>labor. And, you know, that&rsquo;s where the political parties that we know today and, you</p>
<p>know, the kind of early unions came out of as well.</p>
<p>The sort of feeling of a mass society, but where people weren&rsquo;t really able to</p>
<p>get together and implement or push for change.</p>
<p>You know, with unions at a small scale and a local scale, it&rsquo;s like every good idea</p>
<p>on a small scale can become a bad idea on a large scale.</p>
<p>So like marriage is a beautiful thing, but at a large scale, it becomes the marriage</p>
<p>industrial complex that tries to make money off of it.</p>
<p>Combined with the lawyers that try to make money off the divorce, it just becomes a</p>
<p>caricature of a thing or like Christmas and the holidays.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I don&rsquo;t disagree.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m saying is this people are basically looking for something here.</p>
<p>And, you know, kind of this is why, I mean, I myself am starting to think about much</p>
<p>more local, you know, kind of solutions for a lot of these, you know, kind of</p>
<p>problems. It&rsquo;s again, the teamed, networked approach.</p>
<p>On the impeachment, looking back, because you&rsquo;re part of it, you get to experience</p>
<p>it. Do you think they strengthened or weakened this nation?</p>
<p>I think it weakened in many respects, just the way that it was conducted.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a new book coming out by a couple of journalists in the Washington</p>
<p>Post. I haven&rsquo;t actually seen it yet, but I really did, you know, kind of worry</p>
<p>that myself, that it became a spectacle.</p>
<p>And although it actually, I think, in many respects was important in terms of an</p>
<p>exercise of civic responsibility and, you know, gave people a big, massive lesson in</p>
<p>civics, everyone&rsquo;s kind of running out and looking up the whole process of impeachment</p>
<p>and what that meant and kind of like congressional prerogatives.</p>
<p>I was as well. I was, you know, running off myself and, you know, trying to learn an</p>
<p>enormous amount about it because I was in the middle of all of this.</p>
<p>That it didn&rsquo;t ultimately show responsibility and accountability.</p>
<p>And that in itself was weakened because on both sides, there was a lot of partisan</p>
<p>politics. I mean, I think that there was a dereliction of duty in many respects.</p>
<p>I mean, especially, I have to say, on the part of Republican members of Congress who</p>
<p>were, you know, kind of they should have been embracing Congress&rsquo;s prerogatives.</p>
<p>You could have, you know, kind of basically done this in something of a different way.</p>
<p>But the whole thing is because it was this larger atmosphere of polarised, not even</p>
<p>polarised, but fractured, fractured politics.</p>
<p>And I was deeply disappointed, I have to say, in many of the members of Congress on the</p>
<p>Republican side. I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of grandstanding that I really didn&rsquo;t like a bit</p>
<p>on the Democratic side either.</p>
<p>And not admitting to mistakes and, you know, not kind of addressing head on, you know,</p>
<p>the fact that they&rsquo;d, you know, kind of been pushing for Trump to be impeached and, you</p>
<p>know, talking about being an illegitimate president, you know, kind of right from the</p>
<p>very beginning. And, you know, as a result, a lot of people just saw this as kind of a</p>
<p>continuation of, you know, political games, you know, coming out of the 2016 election.</p>
<p>But on the Republican side, it was just a game.</p>
<p>There was people I knew who were, you know, basically, you know, at one point one of them</p>
<p>winked at me. You know, in the middle of this, you know, kind of impeachment, it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>like, don&rsquo;t take this personally.</p>
<p>You know, this is a game and I just thought, this isn&rsquo;t a game.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think that it, you know, kind of weakened because, I mean, again, on the</p>
<p>outside, it weakened us, the whole process weakened us in the eyes of the world, because</p>
<p>again, the United States was the gold standard.</p>
<p>And I do think, I mean, again, in the terms of the larger population, although a lot of</p>
<p>people did actually see the system, you know, standing up, trying to do something to hold</p>
<p>people account. But there still was that element of circus and a big political game and</p>
<p>people being careless with the country.</p>
<p>But I do think that the Democrats were the instigators of the circus.</p>
<p>So as it&rsquo;s perhaps subtle, but there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a different way you talk about.</p>
<p>Issues or concerns about accountability when you care about your country, when you love</p>
<p>your country, when you love the ideals and when you versus when you just want to win.</p>
<p>And stick it to the other side.</p>
<p>No, I agree.</p>
<p>I mean, there were people who I actually thought managed that, that made it about the</p>
<p>country rather than about themselves.</p>
<p>But I guess there&rsquo;s no incentive to do that.</p>
<p>Yeah, there were others who did a lot of grandstanding.</p>
<p>Yeah. And that&rsquo;s another problem of our political incentive structures, that the kind</p>
<p>of sense of accountability and responsibility tends to be personal.</p>
<p>You know, people, whether people decide to do it or not, it&rsquo;s not institutional, if that</p>
<p>makes sense. We&rsquo;ve had a kind of a breakdown of that kind of that sense.</p>
<p>Now, I took an oath of office and I&rsquo;m assuming that most of them did, too.</p>
<p>You know, I had to be sworn in, you know, when I took those positions.</p>
<p>I took that seriously, but I already took an oath of citizenship.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, you know, presumably you did, too.</p>
<p>You know, you kind of started to become an American citizen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something you take on lightly.</p>
<p>And, you know, that&rsquo;s why I felt this deep sense of responsibility all the time, which</p>
<p>is why I went into the administration in the first place.</p>
<p>I mean, I got a lot of flack for it because, you know, I thought, well, look, I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>asked and there&rsquo;s a real issue here after the Russian interference and, you know, the</p>
<p>whole influence operation in the 2016 elections.</p>
<p>And I knew what was going on and I should do something.</p>
<p>You know, if not me, then, you know, OK, someone else will go and do it.</p>
<p>But can I live with myself just sitting on the sidelines and criticizing what people</p>
<p>are doing, you know, and kind of worrying about this, or am I actually going to muck</p>
<p>in there and, you know, just go and do something?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like seeing your house on fire and you see that, you know, OK, this is pretty</p>
<p>awful and dangerous, but I could go in there and and do something.</p>
<p>To clarify, the house on fire, meaning the cyber war that&rsquo;s going on or cyber attacks,</p>
<p>the cyber security.</p>
<p>Well, in the 2016, you know, when the Russians had interfered in the election, you</p>
<p>know, I mean, basically this was a huge national security crisis and our politics.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d gone mad as a result of it.</p>
<p>And we in fact, we were making the situation worse.</p>
<p>And I felt that I could, you know, kind of at the time, maybe I could do something, I</p>
<p>could try to clarify, I could, you know, work with others who I knew in the government</p>
<p>from previous stints in the government to push back against this and try to make sure</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t happen again.</p>
<p>And look, and I also didn&rsquo;t have this, you know, mad, you know, kind of crazy</p>
<p>ideological view of Russia either.</p>
<p>I mean, I knew the place, I knew the people had been sitting a long time and quite calm</p>
<p>about it. I don&rsquo;t take it personally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not kind of an extension of self.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, something I&rsquo;ve spent a long time trying to understand for myself, going</p>
<p>back to that very beginning of why were the Russians trying to blow us up?</p>
<p>There must be an explanation.</p>
<p>There was. It was a very complicated and complex explanation.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t as simple as how it sounded.</p>
<p>And also there&rsquo;s a long tail to 2016, you know, Putin&rsquo;s perceptions, the kind of things</p>
<p>that he thought were going on, you know, the whole way that what they did was actually</p>
<p>fairly straightforward.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d done this before in the Soviet period, during the Cold War, classic influence</p>
<p>operation. It just had gone beyond the bounds of anything they could have anticipated</p>
<p>because of social media and just a confluence of circumstances in the United States as</p>
<p>well. We were very fragile and vulnerable.</p>
<p>And I remember at one point having a discussion with the Russian ambassador where, you</p>
<p>know, we were complaining about the Russian intervention.</p>
<p>He said, are you telling me that the United States is a banana republic, that it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>vulnerable to these kinds of efforts?</p>
<p>He actually looked genuinely mystified, although, you know, obviously it was probably, you</p>
<p>know, part of a kind of political shtick there.</p>
<p>But he had a point.</p>
<p>The United States had never been that vulnerable as it suddenly was in 2016.</p>
<p>And in the time that I was in government and going back to what you asked about the whole</p>
<p>impeachment and the whole exercise in Congress, that vulnerability was as stark as it,</p>
<p>you know, ever could be.</p>
<p>Our domestic politics were as much a part of the problem as anything else.</p>
<p>They were the kindling to all of the fires.</p>
<p>Putin didn&rsquo;t start any of this, the kind of problems, domestically, he just took advantage</p>
<p>of them and, you know, basically added a bit of an accelerant here and there.</p>
<p>Yeah, the interference, I mean, that&rsquo;s a much longer discussion because it&rsquo;s also for me</p>
<p>technically fascinating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing with the idea of just launching like a million bots, but they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>just positive stuff and just being kind.</p>
<p>Yeah, I always kind of wonder if is it possible to do something on this scale that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>positive? Because, you know, a lot of people seem to be able to use all of this for pretty</p>
<p>negative effect. You&rsquo;ve got to kind of hope that you could do this, use the same networks</p>
<p>for positive effect.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s actually where a lot of the war, I think from the original hackers to</p>
<p>today, what gives people like me and I think a lot of people that in the hacking</p>
<p>community pleasure is to do something difficult, break through the systems and do the</p>
<p>ethical thing, right?</p>
<p>So do the because if there&rsquo;s something broken about the system, you want to break</p>
<p>through all the rules and do something that you know in your heart is the right thing to</p>
<p>do. I mean, that&rsquo;s what Aaron Schwartz did with releasing journals and publications that</p>
<p>were behind paywalls to the public and got arrested for it and then committed.</p>
<p>But to me, it&rsquo;s fascinating because maybe you can actually educate me, but I felt that</p>
<p>the Russian interference in terms of social engineering, in terms of bots, all that kind</p>
<p>of stuff, I feel like that was more used for political bickering than to actually</p>
<p>understand the national security problem, because I would like to know the actual</p>
<p>numbers involved in the influence.</p>
<p>I would like to, I mean, obviously, hopefully people now understand that better than are</p>
<p>trying to defend the national security of this country.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just it felt like like, for example, if I launch one bot and then and then just</p>
<p>contact somebody at The New York Times saying I launched this one bot, they&rsquo;ll just say</p>
<p>MIT scientist hacks, you know, and then that will spread.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s exactly what happened.</p>
<p>It was, you know, kind of I think that, you know, Putin and some of the people around</p>
<p>him understood because, again, propaganda state, they spend an awful lot of time thinking</p>
<p>about how you basically put out your own content and how you get maximum effect through</p>
<p>performance. Putin himself is a political performance artist.</p>
<p>I mean, Trump understood exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>They were actually operating in parallel, not in collusion, but in parallel.</p>
<p>You know, basically, Trump understood how to get lots of free air time, you know, how to</p>
<p>get himself at the center of attention.</p>
<p>Putin did that through a kind of, I think, a less organic kind of way.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of people working around him.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the old Bolshevik agitprop and, you know, kind of then the whole Soviet</p>
<p>propaganda machine. And, you know, Putin kind of growing up in that kind of environment</p>
<p>and having, you know, the kind of the Kremlin press office and all the kind of people</p>
<p>around him kind of a massive machine knew how that worked.</p>
<p>I mean, they haven&rsquo;t done what the Chinese did in Russia, like blocking everything and</p>
<p>having a big firewall. It was kind of putting out lots of content, getting into the, you</p>
<p>know, the sort of center of attention.</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s doing the same kind of thing.</p>
<p>And the Russians understood that, you know, if you put a bit of things out there and then</p>
<p>you call up the New York Times and people are going to run with it.</p>
<p>And what they wanted was the perception that they had actually sweared the election.</p>
<p>They loved it. This was the huge mistake of the Democrats and everything.</p>
<p>I mean, I kept trying to push against this.</p>
<p>No, they did not elect Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Americans elected Donald Trump.</p>
<p>And, you know, the Electoral College was a key part.</p>
<p>Vladimir Putin didn&rsquo;t make that up, you know.</p>
<p>And basically, I also remember, you know, at one point the Russian ambassador, you know,</p>
<p>talking to me about when we were doing the standard, you know, here we are.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re lodging our complaint about the interference.</p>
<p>You know, he didn&rsquo;t. He basically said, well, we didn&rsquo;t, you know, kind of invent Comey.</p>
<p>And, you know, basically the, you know, the decision to reopen, you know, Hillary</p>
<p>Clinton&rsquo;s emails or, you know, kind of Anthony Weiner and, you know, kind of his emails</p>
<p>on his computer.</p>
<p>And I was like, yeah, he&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, there were plenty of things in our own system that created chaos and</p>
<p>tipped the election. Not, you know, kind of what the Russians did.</p>
<p>But, you know, it&rsquo;s obviously easier to blame the Russians and blame yourself when, you</p>
<p>know, things are kind of&hellip; or those random forces and those random factors.</p>
<p>Because people couldn&rsquo;t understand what had happened in 2016.</p>
<p>There was no hanging chads like 2000, where there was, you know, kind of a technical</p>
<p>problem that actually, you know, ended up with the intervention of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>There was, you know, pure and simple, the Electoral College at work and a candidate</p>
<p>that nobody had expected, including the Republicans in the primaries, you know, to end</p>
<p>up getting kind of elected or put forward in a different 2016, suddenly becoming the</p>
<p>president. And they needed a meta explanation.</p>
<p>It was much better to say Vladimir Putin had done it.</p>
<p>And Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin guys were like, oh, my God, yeah, fantastic.</p>
<p>Champagne, pop cocks popping.</p>
<p>This is great. Our chaos agent.</p>
<p>They knew they hadn&rsquo;t done it, but they&rsquo;d love to take credit for it.</p>
<p>And so, you know, the very fact that other people couldn&rsquo;t explain these complex</p>
<p>dynamics to themselves, basically dovetails beautifully with Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s</p>
<p>attempts to be the kind of the Kremlin gremlin in the system.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s, you know, basically was taking advantage of that forever more.</p>
<p>And I wanted, you know, to basically try to work with us to cut through that.</p>
<p>And the thing is, then, you know, people lost faith in the integrity of the election</p>
<p>system because people were out there, you know, suggesting that the Russians had</p>
<p>actually distorted the elections. People had written books about that.</p>
<p>They said, you know, that they hacked the system when, you know, they were trying to</p>
<p>hack our minds. But again, we were the fertile soil for this.</p>
<p>I mean, we know this from Russian history, the role of the Bolsheviks, you know, the</p>
<p>whole 1920s and 1930s with Stalin, the fellow travelers and the, you know, socialist,</p>
<p>you know, international. I mean, the Russians and the Soviets have been at this for</p>
<p>years about kind of pulling, you know, kind of people along and into kind of a broader</p>
<p>frame. But it didn&rsquo;t mean that they were influencing, you know, directly the politics</p>
<p>of of countries, you know, writ large, that there are plenty of interventions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that we were somehow it was a confluence of events, a perfect storm.</p>
<p>We were somehow exquisitely vulnerable because of things that we had done to</p>
<p>ourselves. It was what Americans were doing to themselves that was the issue.</p>
<p>You think that&rsquo;s the bigger threat than large scale bot armies?</p>
<p>Those can be a threat. Obviously, they do have an impact, but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s how people</p>
<p>process information. It&rsquo;s kind of like the lack of critical thinking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not on the Internet to that extent.</p>
<p>I go looking for information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not on social media.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in social media, but not by myself.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t put myself out there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not I haven&rsquo;t got a Twitter feed.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have a Twitter one.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there is a fan club.</p>
<p>I have all kinds of strange things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Fiona Hill&rsquo;s cat, which I kind of like, you know, occasionally people send</p>
<p>things. You have so many fans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hilarious. But what I what I what I try to do is just be really critical.</p>
<p>I mean, my you know, my mom sends me stuff.</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, you know, your own mother can be as much of an agent of misinformation</p>
<p>as, you know, kind of Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re all you know, kind of we all have to really think about what it is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re reading. There&rsquo;s one thing from my childhood that was really important.</p>
<p>I mean, I always think every kid in school should have this.</p>
<p>My next door neighbor, who was</p>
<p>he was actually very active in the in the Labour Party.</p>
<p>And he was, you know, kind of really interested in the way that opinion,</p>
<p>you know, shape people&rsquo;s political views.</p>
<p>And he was Welsh. He was a native Welsh speaker.</p>
<p>So, you know, he was always trying to explore English and how, you know,</p>
<p>there was kind of the reach of, you know, the English culture and, you know,</p>
<p>kind of how it&rsquo;s kind of shaping the way that people thought.</p>
<p>And he used to read every single newspaper,</p>
<p>you know, from all the different spectrums, which was quite easy to do,</p>
<p>you know, back in the 70s and 80s, because there weren&rsquo;t that many in the UK context.</p>
<p>And every Sunday, he would get all the different Sunday papers</p>
<p>from all the different kind of ideological vantage points.</p>
<p>And then when I got to be a teenager, he&rsquo;d invite me to look at them with him</p>
<p>because he was my godfather.</p>
<p>And he was just an incredible guy.</p>
<p>And he was just super interesting and, you know, kind of culturally,</p>
<p>you know, an outsider, always kind of looking in.</p>
<p>And he basically ran through, you know, what the Guardian looked at,</p>
<p>the Observer, the Daily Mail, the Sun, you know, kind of all of these,</p>
<p>you know, the Telegraph, all of these newspapers and how you could tell,</p>
<p>you know, their different vantage points.</p>
<p>And of course, it&rsquo;s complicated to do that now.</p>
<p>I mean, in this, you know, incredibly extensive media space,</p>
<p>I look at what it is that they&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>And then I try to, you know, read around it and then, you know,</p>
<p>look at what other people are saying and why they&rsquo;re saying it.</p>
<p>And who are they? What&rsquo;s their context?</p>
<p>And that was kind of basically what I was taught to look at.</p>
<p>And I think everybody should have that.</p>
<p>And certainly that&rsquo;s something that people in politics</p>
<p>that are in charge of directing policy should be doing.</p>
<p>They should be.</p>
<p>Not getting lost in</p>
<p>in the sort of the hysteria that can be created.</p>
<p>Like, it does seem that the American system somehow,</p>
<p>not the political system, just humans, love drama.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very good.</p>
<p>Like the Hunter Biden laptop story.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always like one, two, three stories somehow</p>
<p>that we just pick, that we&rsquo;re just going to this is the stuff</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to fight about for this election.</p>
<p>And everyone&rsquo;s got an opinion on it.</p>
<p>Yeah, everybody. Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the most like Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s emails.</p>
<p>Russians hacked the election.</p>
<p>Yeah, we had John Podesta&rsquo;s pasta recipes for a while,</p>
<p>you know, that we were kind of all obsessing over.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, people running out and trying them out, you know, something like that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s all the best conspiracy theories about Giuliani.</p>
<p>I just love it.</p>
<p>We just pick a random story.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>And it detracts from what the larger question should be,</p>
<p>which is about the family members of, you know, senior officials</p>
<p>and whether they should be anywhere near any of the issues that they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s ethics, there&rsquo;s government ethics and things that,</p>
<p>you know, kind of across the board.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a bigger story in there.</p>
<p>But that becomes a distraction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a look over there.</p>
<p>You know, the oldest trick in the book, you know, kind of idea.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And politicians are really good at that because it detracts from the larger question</p>
<p>because every single member of Congress and, you know, government official,</p>
<p>their family should be nowhere near anything they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Well, that I could push back and disagree on.</p>
<p>I mean, well, it depends on what they do, if they&rsquo;re making money out of it,</p>
<p>you know, and kind of basically being in business is what I mean.</p>
<p>You know, kind of this is a this is an issue.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not, you know, Hunter Biden on his own.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, kind of basically the kids of, you know, the Trump family.</p>
<p>You name it.</p>
<p>Yeah. In general like that.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a lot of families that,</p>
<p>you know, they work very closely together, do business together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very successful.</p>
<p>I get very weird about that.</p>
<p>It it just feels like you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>In fact, I don&rsquo;t even like hiring or working with friends.</p>
<p>Initially, you make friends with the people you work with.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. No, I have the I have the same worries as well,</p>
<p>because it kind of clouds, you know, I would encourage,</p>
<p>you know, my daughter to do something completely different.</p>
<p>Right. Not going to the same field.</p>
<p>Now, look, it&rsquo;s different if you&rsquo;re, you know, in science or,</p>
<p>you know, mathematics or something like this.</p>
<p>And, you know, maybe, you know, kind of you&rsquo;ve got a family,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re kind of building on some of their theories and ideas.</p>
<p>You know, if Albert Einstein had a, you know, kind of an offspring,</p>
<p>it was mathematics and took, you know, father&rsquo;s thinking further.</p>
<p>That would be very different.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s, you know, kind of you&rsquo;re in business and other things</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just, you know, it&rsquo;s the nepotism problem.</p>
<p>You know, one has that.</p>
<p>Well, science says that, too, in the space of ideas.</p>
<p>Well, they do.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re not, people aren&rsquo;t coming in and building on the ideas</p>
<p>in a constructive way.</p>
<p>Right. But even for son, daughter of Einstein,</p>
<p>you want to think outside the box of the previous.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m meaning.</p>
<p>But I mean, it&rsquo;s just but they shouldn&rsquo;t be sort of told, no, sorry,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t go and study math because, you know, whatever physics,</p>
<p>you know, because of.</p>
<p>But a lot of that, you can&rsquo;t actually make it into law.</p>
<p>Well, you could, I suppose.</p>
<p>But honestly, if you do that kind of thing, you should be transparent.</p>
<p>There should be just an honesty about it.</p>
<p>It gets back to what I was talking about before.</p>
<p>We need diversity of views and diversity of thinking.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t have other things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like being partisan or, you know,</p>
<p>rooting just for a team.</p>
<p>You know, if something is going to cloud your judgment</p>
<p>or constrain the way you think about things and become,</p>
<p>you know, kind of a barrier to moving on out.</p>
<p>And look, that&rsquo;s what we see in the system around Putin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of kleptocratic and it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s filled with nepotism.</p>
<p>All of the kind of like the people who you kind of see out there</p>
<p>in prominent positions are the sons or daughters of,</p>
<p>including Putin himself.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s when a system has degenerated.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know, kind of, and I suppose in a way</p>
<p>this is a symbol of the degeneration of the system.</p>
<p>But again, it&rsquo;s just a diversion from, you know,</p>
<p>kind of the bigger issues and bigger implications of things that we&rsquo;re discussing.</p>
<p>So critics on the left often use the straw man of TDS,</p>
<p>Trump Derangement Syndrome.</p>
<p>Why does Donald Trump arouse so much emotion in people?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the nature of the person.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t feel particularly emotional about him.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s kind of a.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a very flawed guy, to be honest.</p>
<p>And this may seem bizarre.</p>
<p>I felt sorry for him because this guy is so vulnerable,</p>
<p>so wrapped up in himself.</p>
<p>But I mean, he&rsquo;s just exquisitely</p>
<p>open to manipulation.</p>
<p>And I saw people taking advantage of him all the time.</p>
<p>He has zero self-awareness.</p>
<p>I mean, I kept thinking to myself, my God,</p>
<p>if this guy didn&rsquo;t have this entourage around him, how would he function?</p>
<p>I mean, I felt sorry for us as well.</p>
<p>I mean, that he ended up being our president,</p>
<p>because that should not have happened.</p>
<p>I mean, in terms of character and in terms of fit for the job.</p>
<p>Although I saw this, you know, kind of over a period of time,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t feel, you know, kind of.</p>
<p>Any sense of derangement, you know, kind of around him.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t drive me nuts in that way.</p>
<p>I just became I was just very worried about, you know,</p>
<p>the kind of the impact that he was having on many particular issues.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the important thing.</p>
<p>So what I noticed with people that criticize Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Is they get caught up in the momentum of it</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re unable to see</p>
<p>First of all, let&rsquo;s start with some ground truth, which is</p>
<p>approximately half the country voted for the guy.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah. And more voted in 2020 than voted in 2016 for him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I just I just feel like people don&rsquo;t load that in when they&rsquo;re honestly.</p>
<p>A lot of those people didn&rsquo;t vote for him and his personality</p>
<p>enough in the past.</p>
<p>People didn&rsquo;t vote for him and his personality and often could,</p>
<p>because I know a lot of people who voted for him</p>
<p>first time and second time, and they could disassociate.</p>
<p>You know, kind of the all of the kind of features of Donald Trump</p>
<p>that drives other people nuts from, you know, what they thought that an actual fact</p>
<p>he could achieve in terms of it wasn&rsquo;t just this kind of sense about,</p>
<p>well, I couldn&rsquo;t possibly vote for Democrats.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s just like, well, look, he shakes things up</p>
<p>and we need things to shake to be shaken up.</p>
<p>And some people might have voted for him for personality.</p>
<p>This is what some of them, some of them did as well.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just saying that not all of them did either.</p>
<p>Well, we don&rsquo;t know that data.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>But yeah, I can&rsquo;t say how much I&rsquo;m just saying anecdotally.</p>
<p>I know people have voted for him because he&rsquo;s him from the charisma.</p>
<p>And I know that he voted because he&rsquo;s shaking things up</p>
<p>and, you know, he&rsquo;s keeping people on their toes and,</p>
<p>you know, kind of we need that, you know, idea.</p>
<p>But the way to avoid Trump derangement syndrome to me,</p>
<p>me as a doctor, I&rsquo;m sort of prescribing to the patients on this syndrome,</p>
<p>this issue is I feel like you have to empathize with the people.</p>
<p>You have to imagine in your mind all the different, like,</p>
<p>strengths that the people who have voted for Donald Trump see</p>
<p>and really understand it, really feel it, like walk around with it.</p>
<p>And then criticize.</p>
<p>Like, I just feel like people get lost in this bubble of criticism in their own head.</p>
<p>I forget, like, the tribe you&rsquo;re in or whatever.</p>
<p>In their own head, they&rsquo;re not able to see, like,</p>
<p>half this country that we&rsquo;re a part of voted for the person.</p>
<p>Same with Biden.</p>
<p>Half the country voted for the guy.</p>
<p>The people that are criticizing Biden and they&rsquo;re doing this.</p>
<p>The way Biden is currently criticized is not based on policy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s based on personal stuff, similar like to Trump.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it is.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what people don&rsquo;t look.</p>
<p>I think part of that is, I mean, look, first of all,</p>
<p>I want to say I completely agree with you about understanding</p>
<p>where people are coming from.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s very important for people to listen to other people and their views.</p>
<p>I try to do that all the time.</p>
<p>Try to learn from that.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, everybody&rsquo;s got a perspective and a context.</p>
<p>We all live in a certain context.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all living in history.</p>
<p>Our own personal histories matter a lot.</p>
<p>And also the larger context and environment in which we&rsquo;re living in.</p>
<p>And where we live and who we live with.</p>
<p>And, you know, the kinds of lives that we lead as well.</p>
<p>Those are all extraordinarily important.</p>
<p>I mean, I know that from myself.</p>
<p>Everything that I&rsquo;ve done in my life has been shaped by where I came from,</p>
<p>who I was, my family and the way that we looked at things.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t take yourself out of that.</p>
<p>I mean, you can do it in some, you know, like a science or something else.</p>
<p>But, you know, it&rsquo;s still your own views.</p>
<p>And maybe some of the ideas that you have in pursuing an experiment</p>
<p>might have been shaped by your larger context,</p>
<p>you know, depending on what it is that you work on.</p>
<p>But the other thing is the nature of the political system.</p>
<p>The presidential election is like a personality contest, a beauty contest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a kind of a referendum on, you know, one person or another.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like what we see in Russia, honestly, with, you know,</p>
<p>Putin or not Putin, or Putin and Putin before.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s all about Putin.</p>
<p>And, you know, what do you think about Putin?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about what a president should be doing.</p>
<p>And, you know, kind of what their policies are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the bizarreness of the US political system.</p>
<p>Look, we&rsquo;ve just seen this happening in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got this core of a couple of thousand,</p>
<p>a couple of hundred thousand, rather, people in the Conservative Party</p>
<p>have just voted for, you know, three leaders in a row.</p>
<p>The rest of the country isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just looking at, you know, whether they like that personality</p>
<p>and, you know, what they say to them</p>
<p>rather than what they&rsquo;re necessarily going to do for the country.</p>
<p>I mean, which is, you know, kind of pretty absurd.</p>
<p>I mean, again, the presidency is a weird hybrid in the United States.</p>
<p>You know, we were talking before about,</p>
<p>the person who should be running the country</p>
<p>is the chief executive or the prime minister in another setting.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t think of it like that.</p>
<p>You know, we often think about whether we like the guy or not.</p>
<p>Or, you know, we&rsquo;d like to hang out with him.</p>
<p>Or, you know, one of my younger relatives,</p>
<p>and I said, so why did you vote for Trump?</p>
<p>He said, well, he was great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>I went to his rallies.</p>
<p>I got, you know, all kind of charged up.</p>
<p>And I said, could you see yourself voting for Biden?</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s too old.</p>
<p>And I said, well, you know, he&rsquo;s only just a little bit,</p>
<p>you know, kind of older than Trump.</p>
<p>Or he&rsquo;s, you know, the same age as your grandma.</p>
<p>Do you think your grandma&rsquo;s old?</p>
<p>Oh, no, not at all.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just this kind of perception.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s boring.</p>
<p>You know, so there&rsquo;s, people are actually sometimes,</p>
<p>you know, basically being, you know,</p>
<p>kind of motivated by just a feeling,</p>
<p>you know, kind of that kind of sense.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the sort of nature of the,</p>
<p>you know, the presidency.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this kind of how you feel about yourself as an American,</p>
<p>or how you feel about the country writ large,</p>
<p>the kind of the symbol of the state.</p>
<p>Look at, you know, in Britain,</p>
<p>you had, you know, Queen Elizabeth II.</p>
<p>And everybody, you know, seemed to,</p>
<p>for the most part, not everyone, I guess,</p>
<p>but most people respected her as a person,</p>
<p>as a personality, as a kind of symbol of the state.</p>
<p>Even if they actually didn&rsquo;t really like</p>
<p>the institution of the monarchy.</p>
<p>There was something, you know,</p>
<p>kind of about that particular personality</p>
<p>that you were able to, you know,</p>
<p>kind of relate to in that context.</p>
<p>But in the United States,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got all of that rolled into one.</p>
<p>The head of state, the symbol of the state,</p>
<p>the kind of queen, the king, the kind of idea.</p>
<p>The chief executive, the kind of prime ministerial role.</p>
<p>And then the commander-in-chief of the military.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all things, you know, kind of at once.</p>
<p>But ultimately, for a lot of people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just how we feel about that person.</p>
<p>Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t go vote for them because of this,</p>
<p>or I couldn&rsquo;t vote for them because of that.</p>
<p>And in 2016, you know,</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton actually did win the election</p>
<p>in terms of the popular vote.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t that, you know,</p>
<p>kind of people wouldn&rsquo;t vote for a woman.</p>
<p>I mean, more people voted for her on the popular level,</p>
<p>not obviously, you know, through the electoral college</p>
<p>in the electoral college vote.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t just, you know, gender or something like that,</p>
<p>but it was an awful lot of things</p>
<p>for people who found Trump attractive.</p>
<p>Because he was sticking up the big middle finger</p>
<p>to the establishment.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an anti-establishment change character.</p>
<p>There was a lot of people voted for Barack Obama</p>
<p>for the same reason and voted for Trump.</p>
<p>We know that phenomenon.</p>
<p>What was it, 11, you know, 12% of people, you know,</p>
<p>so they could vote for some completely,</p>
<p>totally different, radically different people</p>
<p>because of that sort of sense of change and charisma.</p>
<p>I mean, I had people who I knew voted for Trump,</p>
<p>but would have voted for Obama again if he&rsquo;d run again.</p>
<p>Because they just liked the way that he spoke.</p>
<p>They liked the way that, you know,</p>
<p>because they said, I mean,</p>
<p>this is all my own anecdotal things,</p>
<p>but one of my relatives said,</p>
<p>I could listen to Obama all day, every day.</p>
<p>I just love the way he sounded.</p>
<p>I love the way he looked, you know,</p>
<p>I love just like the whole thing about him.</p>
<p>And then to say about Trump, well, he was exciting.</p>
<p>It was interesting, you know,</p>
<p>he was kind of like, you know, whipping it up there.</p>
<p>You know, so there&rsquo;s this, just this kind of feeling,</p>
<p>you know, we always say about, you know,</p>
<p>could you have a beer with this person?</p>
<p>And people decide they couldn&rsquo;t have one</p>
<p>with Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>And, you know, maybe they could go off</p>
<p>and have one with Barack Obama and with Donald Trump.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t want to have one with Joe Biden,</p>
<p>you know, for example.</p>
<p>And remember, George W. Bush didn&rsquo;t drink,</p>
<p>so he wouldn&rsquo;t have had a beer with him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d have gone out and got a soda or something with him.</p>
<p>But, you know, there&rsquo;s this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s that kind of element</p>
<p>of just that sort of personal connection</p>
<p>in the way that the whole presidential election is set up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s less about the parties,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s less about the platforms,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s more about the person.</p>
<p>Yeah, and picking one side</p>
<p>and like sticking with your person,</p>
<p>really like a support team.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What do you think about Vladimir Putin,</p>
<p>the man and the leader?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s actually look at the full,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve written a lot about him,</p>
<p>the recent Vladimir Putin</p>
<p>and the full context of his life.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s zoom out</p>
<p>and look at the last 20 plus years of his rule.</p>
<p>In what ways has he been good for Russia?</p>
<p>In what ways bad?</p>
<p>Well, if you look to the first couple of terms</p>
<p>of his presidency,</p>
<p>I think, you know, on the overall ledger,</p>
<p>he would have actually said that he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>made a lot of achievements from Russia.</p>
<p>Now, there was, of course,</p>
<p>the pretty black period of the war,</p>
<p>black period of the war in Chechnya.</p>
<p>But, you know, he didn&rsquo;t start that.</p>
<p>That was Boris Yeltsin.</p>
<p>That was obviously a pretty catastrophic event.</p>
<p>But if you look at then other parts of the ledger</p>
<p>of what Putin was doing,</p>
<p>you know, from the 2000s, you know, onwards,</p>
<p>he stabilised the Russian economy,</p>
<p>brought back, you know, kind of confidence</p>
<p>in the Russian economy and financial system.</p>
<p>He built up a pretty impressive team of technocrats.</p>
<p>The central bank and the economics and,</p>
<p>you know, finance ministries,</p>
<p>who, you know, really got the country back</p>
<p>into shape again and solvent,</p>
<p>paid off all of the debts</p>
<p>and, you know, really started to</p>
<p>build the country back up again domestically.</p>
<p>And, you know, the first couple of terms,</p>
<p>again, putting Chechnya, you know, to one side,</p>
<p>which is a little hard because, I mean,</p>
<p>there was a lot of atrocities.</p>
<p>And I have to say that, you know,</p>
<p>he was pretty involved in all of that</p>
<p>because the FSB, which he&rsquo;d headed previously,</p>
<p>was in charge of wrapping up Chechnya.</p>
<p>And it created, you know,</p>
<p>kind of a very strange sort of system of fealty,</p>
<p>almost a feudal system in the kind of relationship</p>
<p>between Putin at the top and Kadyrov in Chechnya.</p>
<p>And there was quite a lot of distortions,</p>
<p>you know, kind of as a result of that</p>
<p>in the way that the Russian Federation was run,</p>
<p>you know, a lot more of an emphasis</p>
<p>on the security services, for example.</p>
<p>But there was a lot of pragmatism,</p>
<p>you know, opening up the country for business,</p>
<p>you know, basically extending relationships.</p>
<p>I would say that, you know,</p>
<p>by the end of those first couple of terms of Putin,</p>
<p>Russians were living their best lives.</p>
<p>You know, there was a lot of opportunity for people.</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s labor, you know, was being paid for.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t being taxed.</p>
<p>The taxes were coming out of the extractive industries.</p>
<p>There was, you know, kind of, I guess,</p>
<p>a sense of much more political pluralism.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the kind of the chaos of the Eltsin period.</p>
<p>And then you see a shift.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s pretty much when he comes back into power again</p>
<p>in 2011, 2012.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when we see kind of a different phase emerging.</p>
<p>And, you know, part of it</p>
<p>is the larger international environment</p>
<p>where Putin himself has become kind of convinced</p>
<p>that the United States is out to get him.</p>
<p>And part of it goes back to the decision</p>
<p>on the part of the United States</p>
<p>to invade Iraq in 2003.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also, you know, the recognition of Kosovo in 2008</p>
<p>and, you know, the whole kind of machinations</p>
<p>around all kinds of, you know,</p>
<p>other issues of NATO expansion and elsewhere.</p>
<p>But Iraq in 2003,</p>
<p>and this kind of whole idea after that</p>
<p>that the United States is in the business of regime change.</p>
<p>And perhaps, you know, has him in his crosshairs as well.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also then kind of, I think,</p>
<p>a sense of building crisis</p>
<p>after the financial crisis and the Great Recession,</p>
<p>2008, 2009.</p>
<p>Because I think Putin, up until then,</p>
<p>believed in, you know,</p>
<p>the whole idea of the global financial system</p>
<p>and that Russia was prospering</p>
<p>and that Russia, you know, part of the G8</p>
<p>and actually could be genuinely one of the, you know,</p>
<p>the major economic and financial powers.</p>
<p>And then suddenly he realizes</p>
<p>that the West is incompetent.</p>
<p>That, you know, we totally mismanaged the economy of our own,</p>
<p>the financial crash in the United States,</p>
<p>the kind of blowing up of the housing bubble</p>
<p>and that we were feckless</p>
<p>and that that had global reverberations.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s prime minister, of course, you know,</p>
<p>in this kind of period.</p>
<p>But then, you know, and I think that that kind of compels him</p>
<p>to kind of come back into the presidency</p>
<p>and try to kind of take things under control again</p>
<p>in 2011, 2012.</p>
<p>And after that, he goes into kind of</p>
<p>a much more sort of focused role</p>
<p>where he sees the United States as a bigger problem.</p>
<p>And he also, you know, starts to, you know,</p>
<p>kind of focus on also the domestic environment</p>
<p>because his return to the presidency is met by protests.</p>
<p>And he genuinely seems to believe,</p>
<p>because again, this is very similar to belief here</p>
<p>in the United States that Donald Trump</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t possibly be elected by Americans.</p>
<p>There somehow was some kind of external interference</p>
<p>because the Russians interfered and had an impact.</p>
<p>Putin himself thinks at that time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the reasons why he interferes</p>
<p>in our elections later,</p>
<p>that the United States and others had interfered</p>
<p>because he knew that people weren&rsquo;t that thrilled</p>
<p>about him coming back.</p>
<p>They kind of liked the Medvedev period</p>
<p>and the protests in Moscow and St. Petersburg</p>
<p>and other major cities,</p>
<p>he starts to believe are instigated by the West,</p>
<p>by the outside because of, you know,</p>
<p>funding for transparency in elections</p>
<p>and, you know, all of the NGOs and others,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re operating,</p>
<p>state department, embassy funding,</p>
<p>you know, and, you know,</p>
<p>the whole attitudes of God is back,</p>
<p>you know, kind of thing.</p>
<p>And so after that, we see Putin going</p>
<p>on a very different footing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also somewhere in that period,</p>
<p>2011, 2012,</p>
<p>we start to kind of obsess about Ukraine.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s always, you know,</p>
<p>I think being kind of steeped</p>
<p>in that whole view of Russian history.</p>
<p>I mean, I heard at that time,</p>
<p>I was in, I&rsquo;ve written about this</p>
<p>and many of the things that, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about Putin,</p>
<p>but in that same timeframe,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to all these conferences in Russia</p>
<p>where Putin is and Peskov,</p>
<p>his press secretary,</p>
<p>and they talk about him reading Russian history.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s this and this kind of period</p>
<p>that he formulates this idea</p>
<p>of the necessity</p>
<p>of reconstituting the Russian world,</p>
<p>the Russian empire.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s obviously been very interested in this.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s always said, of course,</p>
<p>that the collapse of the Soviet Union</p>
<p>was the great catastrophe of the 20th century,</p>
<p>but also the collapse</p>
<p>of the Russian empire before it.</p>
<p>And he starts to be critical</p>
<p>about Lenin and the Bolsheviks.</p>
<p>And he starts to do all this talking</p>
<p>about Ukraine</p>
<p>as the same country,</p>
<p>Ukrainians and Russians being one and the same.</p>
<p>And this is where the ledger flips</p>
<p>because, I mean, the initial question you asked me</p>
<p>is about has Putin been good for Russia or not?</p>
<p>And this is where we get into the focal point</p>
<p>or the point where he&rsquo;s not focusing</p>
<p>on the prosperity and stability</p>
<p>and future of Russia,</p>
<p>but he starts to obsess about the past</p>
<p>and start to take things</p>
<p>in a very different direction.</p>
<p>He starts to clamp down at home</p>
<p>because of the rise of opposition</p>
<p>and the fact that he knows</p>
<p>that his brand is not the same</p>
<p>as it was before</p>
<p>and his popularity is not the same</p>
<p>as it was before</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s already gone over</p>
<p>that period in anybody&rsquo;s professional</p>
<p>and political life</p>
<p>that if you stay around long enough,</p>
<p>people get a bit sick of you.</p>
<p>We talked about that before.</p>
<p>Should you stay in any job</p>
<p>for a long period of time,</p>
<p>you need refreshing.</p>
<p>And Putin is starting to look like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going to be there forever</p>
<p>and people are not happy about that</p>
<p>and would like the chance as well</p>
<p>to move on and move up</p>
<p>and with him still in place,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not going to be particularly possible.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s around the time</p>
<p>when he starts to make the decision</p>
<p>of annexing Crimea.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when the whole thing flips,</p>
<p>in my view.</p>
<p>The annexation of Crimea in 2014</p>
<p>is the beginning of the end</p>
<p>of Vladimir Putin</p>
<p>being a positive force within Russia.</p>
<p>Because if you pay very close attention</p>
<p>to his speech on the annexation</p>
<p>of Crimea in March of 2014,</p>
<p>you see all of the foreshadowing</p>
<p>of where we are now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already of his view</p>
<p>of his obsessions,</p>
<p>his historical obsessions.</p>
<p>His view of himself</p>
<p>has been fused with the state,</p>
<p>a modern czar</p>
<p>and his idea that the West is out to get him.</p>
<p>And it becomes after that,</p>
<p>almost a messianic mission</p>
<p>to turn things in a different direction.</p>
<p>And who are the key people</p>
<p>to you in this evolution</p>
<p>of the human being,</p>
<p>of the leader?</p>
<p>Is it Petrushev?</p>
<p>Is it Shoigu, the Minister of Defense?</p>
<p>Is it, like you mentioned,</p>
<p>Peskov, the press secretary?</p>
<p>What role do some of the others</p>
<p>like Lavrov play?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s more rooted</p>
<p>in the larger context.</p>
<p>I mean, individuals matter</p>
<p>in that context,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>this shared worldview.</p>
<p>And if you go back to the early 1990s,</p>
<p>immediately after the dissolution</p>
<p>of the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>when Yeltsin, you know,</p>
<p>and his counterparts in Ukraine,</p>
<p>Belarus, pull it apart,</p>
<p>there was an awful lot of people</p>
<p>who wanted to maintain the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>not just Putin.</p>
<p>I mean, you remember</p>
<p>after Gorbachev tried to have</p>
<p>the new union treaty in 1991,</p>
<p>and there was the emergency committee</p>
<p>set up the coup against Gorbachev.</p>
<p>It was because they were worrying</p>
<p>he was going too far</p>
<p>and unravelling the union then as well.</p>
<p>They were opposed to his reforms.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always been a kind of</p>
<p>a very strong nationalist contingent</p>
<p>that become Russian nationalists over time,</p>
<p>rather than Soviet hardliners</p>
<p>who basically want to maintain</p>
<p>the empire, the union in some form.</p>
<p>And in the very early part of the 1990s,</p>
<p>there was a lot of pressure put on Ukraine</p>
<p>and all the other former Soviet republics,</p>
<p>now independent states,</p>
<p>by people around, you know,</p>
<p>Mayor Lushkov, for example, in Moscow,</p>
<p>by other forces in the Russian Duma,</p>
<p>not just Vladimir Zhirinovsky and others,</p>
<p>but really serious, you know,</p>
<p>kind of what we would call here</p>
<p>like right-wing nationalist forces.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s pervasive in the system,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s especially pervasive in the KGB</p>
<p>and in the security sector.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where Putin comes out of.</p>
<p>Remember, Putin also was of the opinion</p>
<p>that one of the biggest mistakes</p>
<p>the Bolsheviks made was</p>
<p>getting rid of the Orthodox Church</p>
<p>as an instrument of the state.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this kind of</p>
<p>restorationist wing</p>
<p>within the security services</p>
<p>and the state apparatus</p>
<p>that want to kind of bring back</p>
<p>Russian Orthodoxy as a state instrument,</p>
<p>an instrument of state power.</p>
<p>And they were kind of, you know,</p>
<p>looking all the time about</p>
<p>strengthening the state,</p>
<p>the executive, the presidency.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s everybody who takes part in that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also others who want power, honestly,</p>
<p>and they see Putin as their vehicle for power.</p>
<p>I think people like Sergei Kiryenko,</p>
<p>I knew Kiryenko back in the 90s.</p>
<p>I mean, my God, that guy&rsquo;s all in.</p>
<p>Or like Dmitry Medvedev,</p>
<p>you know, who was, you know,</p>
<p>a warmer, fuzzier version of Putin,</p>
<p>certainly had a totally different perspective,</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t in the KGB.</p>
<p>Did you say warmer, fuzzier version?</p>
<p>A warmer, fuzzier version, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s kind of like,</p>
<p>he was literally a warm personality.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you watched him</p>
<p>during the September 30th annexation,</p>
<p>the guy had all kinds of facial twitches</p>
<p>and looked so rigid and stiff</p>
<p>that he looks like he might implode.</p>
<p>I mean, that wasn&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>how he was, you know, earlier in his career.</p>
<p>And he, you know,</p>
<p>had a different view of perestroika.</p>
<p>We always have to remember</p>
<p>that Putin was not in Russia during perestroika,</p>
<p>he was in Dresden,</p>
<p>watching the East German state fall apart.</p>
<p>And, you know, dealing with the Stasi</p>
<p>and in a kind of place where</p>
<p>you weren&rsquo;t getting a lot of information</p>
<p>about what was happening in West Germany,</p>
<p>or even what was happening back home in perestroika.</p>
<p>And he has that kind of group of people around him,</p>
<p>the Patrushevs and Botnikovs and others,</p>
<p>and Sergei Ivanov and others, you know,</p>
<p>from, you know,</p>
<p>the different configurations of his administration,</p>
<p>who have come out of that same kind of mindset</p>
<p>and are kind of, you know,</p>
<p>wanting to put everything back together again.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of enablers,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of, you know, power seekers,</p>
<p>and there are a lot of people who,</p>
<p>you know, think the same as him as well.</p>
<p>He is a man of his times,</p>
<p>a man of his context.</p>
<p>You, as a top advisor yourself</p>
<p>and a scholar of Putin,</p>
<p>do you think actually now in his inner circle,</p>
<p>are there people he trusts?</p>
<p>There are people he trusts for some things,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s people he trusts for everything.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s the kind of person</p>
<p>who tells anyone everything at all.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s got somebody he deeply confides in.</p>
<p>No, I think he compartmentalizes things.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s often said that the only person he trusts is himself,</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s probably true.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the kind of person who keeps his own counsel.</p>
<p>I mean, people talk about Kovalchuk, for example,</p>
<p>or, you know, kind of some of the other people</p>
<p>who are, you know, friends with him</p>
<p>that are going to go back to his time in St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>You know, at various points,</p>
<p>he seemed to, you know, spend a lot of time,</p>
<p>you know, way back when talking to people who were,</p>
<p>you know, people think of kind of more moderating forces</p>
<p>like Alexei Kudrin,</p>
<p>but, you know, doesn&rsquo;t seem to be interacting,</p>
<p>you know, with them.</p>
<p>You know, there are obviously aspects of his personal life.</p>
<p>You know, does he speak to his daughters?</p>
<p>Does he, you know, speak to, you know,</p>
<p>kind of lovers, you know,</p>
<p>kind of in a way people speculate about,</p>
<p>you know, kind of who might he confide in?</p>
<p>But I would greatly doubt</p>
<p>that he would have deep political discussions with them.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a very guarded, very careful person.</p>
<p>What about sources of information then?</p>
<p>So trust a deep understanding about military strategies</p>
<p>for certain conflicts,</p>
<p>like the war in Ukraine,</p>
<p>or even special subsets of the war in Ukraine,</p>
<p>or any kind of military operations,</p>
<p>getting clear information.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s deeply suspicious,</p>
<p>you know, of people and of information.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, part of the problems</p>
<p>that, you know, we see with Putin now,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve come from isolation during COVID.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m really convinced that,</p>
<p>you know, like many of us,</p>
<p>you know, a lot of Putin&rsquo;s views have hardened.</p>
<p>And the way that he looks at the world</p>
<p>have been shadowed in very dark ways</p>
<p>by the experience of this pandemic.</p>
<p>You know, obviously he was in a bubble,</p>
<p>different kind of bubble from most of us.</p>
<p>I mean, most of us are not in bubbles</p>
<p>with multiple, you know, kind of palaces</p>
<p>and, you know, kind of the Kremlin.</p>
<p>But, you know, we&rsquo;ve seen, you know, so much,</p>
<p>obviously a lot of this is staged, that isolation,</p>
<p>you know, the kind of making it very clear</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s the czar,</p>
<p>the guy who is in charge,</p>
<p>making all the decisions, you know,</p>
<p>at one end of the table</p>
<p>and everybody else is at the other end.</p>
<p>But, you know, it&rsquo;s very difficult then</p>
<p>to bring, you know, information to him in that way.</p>
<p>He used to have a lot of information bundled for him</p>
<p>in the old days by the presidential administration.</p>
<p>I mean, I know that</p>
<p>because it was a lot more open in the past.</p>
<p>And I have a lot of meetings with people</p>
<p>in the presidential administration</p>
<p>who brought outside, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s their all source information,</p>
<p>you know, for him and, you know,</p>
<p>kind of funneled in information</p>
<p>from different think tanks</p>
<p>and, you know, different viewpoints</p>
<p>and maybe a kind of more eclectic,</p>
<p>diversified set of information.</p>
<p>He would meet with people, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve heard all the stories</p>
<p>about where he had once called up Masha Gessen,</p>
<p>you know, and had her, you know, come in,</p>
<p>you know, obviously, you know,</p>
<p>a very different character</p>
<p>as a journalist and a critic.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ve heard about Venediktov</p>
<p>from Ekho Moskvy, the, you know,</p>
<p>the radio program, the editor,</p>
<p>who Putin would, you know,</p>
<p>talk to and consult with.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d reach out people</p>
<p>like Lyudmila Alexeeva, for example,</p>
<p>the head of Memorial.</p>
<p>He had some respect for her</p>
<p>and would, you know,</p>
<p>sometimes just, you know, talk to her,</p>
<p>you know, for example.</p>
<p>All of that seems to have come to a halt.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of us worry,</p>
<p>I mean, us who, you know, watch Putin</p>
<p>about what kind of information is he getting?</p>
<p>You know, is it just information</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s seeking and gathering himself</p>
<p>that fits into his worldview and his framework?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all guilty of that,</p>
<p>of looking for things.</p>
<p>It gets to our social media preferences.</p>
<p>Are people just bringing to him</p>
<p>things that they think he wants to hear?</p>
<p>Like the algorithm, you know,</p>
<p>kind of like the Kremlin working in that regard,</p>
<p>or is he himself, you know,</p>
<p>tapping into sources of information</p>
<p>that he absolutely wants?</p>
<p>And remember, he is not a military guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an operative,</p>
<p>and he was sort of trained in operations</p>
<p>and, you know, contingency planning.</p>
<p>Sergei Shoigu, the defense minister,</p>
<p>as a civil engineer,</p>
<p>was the former minister of emergencies.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t a military planner.</p>
<p>You know, somebody like Gerasimov,</p>
<p>the head of the chiefs of staff,</p>
<p>maybe a military guy, you know,</p>
<p>in this, you know, case from the army,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s also somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s in a different part of the chain of command.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not somebody who would spontaneously</p>
<p>start, you know, telling Putin things.</p>
<p>And Putin, you know, comes out of the FSB,</p>
<p>out of the KGB of the Soviet era,</p>
<p>and he knows the way that, you know,</p>
<p>intelligence gets filtered and works.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably somebody</p>
<p>who wants to consume raw intelligence.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t probably want to</p>
<p>hear anybody else&rsquo;s analysis.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s thrived in the past</p>
<p>of, you know, picking things up from people.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve taken part</p>
<p>in all of these meetings with him,</p>
<p>gone for hours,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s just collecting.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s collecting information.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s sussing people out.</p>
<p>He wants to know the questions they ask.</p>
<p>He learns something</p>
<p>about the questions that people ask,</p>
<p>the way that they ask them.</p>
<p>You know, so he&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>soliciting information himself.</p>
<p>And if he&rsquo;s cut off from that information,</p>
<p>you know, because of circumstances,</p>
<p>then, you know, how is he</p>
<p>formulating things in his head?</p>
<p>And again, getting into,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get into his head,</p>
<p>but you can understand the context</p>
<p>in which he&rsquo;s operating.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where you worry,</p>
<p>because he clearly made this decision</p>
<p>to invade Ukraine</p>
<p>behind the back of most</p>
<p>of his security establishment.</p>
<p>You think so?</p>
<p>Oh, I think it&rsquo;s pretty apparent.</p>
<p>What, what would the security establishment,</p>
<p>what would be the&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, that would be the larger,</p>
<p>you know, thinking of the funneling</p>
<p>in information from the</p>
<p>presidential administration,</p>
<p>from the National Security Council.</p>
<p>It looks like, you know,</p>
<p>he made that decision</p>
<p>with a handful of people.</p>
<p>And then, you know, having worked</p>
<p>in these kinds of environments,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not that dissimilar,</p>
<p>you filter information up.</p>
<p>So think about, you know,</p>
<p>you and I are talking for hours here.</p>
<p>If, if you&rsquo;re in a situation</p>
<p>if you were my, you know,</p>
<p>basically, you know,</p>
<p>senior official and I&rsquo;m your briefer,</p>
<p>I might only get 20 minutes with you.</p>
<p>And you might be just like, you know,</p>
<p>looking at your watch the whole time</p>
<p>and thinking, hang on a second,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to go and I&rsquo;ve got this meeting</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve got that meeting.</p>
<p>And yeah, your point,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to wait there.</p>
<p>So I give this long explanation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to get to the point.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ve got to then</p>
<p>choose for myself,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the information</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to impart to you?</p>
<p>Now to the 20 things</p>
<p>that I think are important,</p>
<p>you know, OK, I&rsquo;ve got 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Maybe I only get two minutes.</p>
<p>Maybe, you know, you get called out</p>
<p>and somebody, you know,</p>
<p>kind of interrupts, something happens.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get one minute, two minutes.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, I want to remember</p>
<p>I had to give a presentation</p>
<p>when I was in government,</p>
<p>to Henry Kissinger,</p>
<p>you know, for that defense policy board.</p>
<p>And we planned bloody weeks on this thing.</p>
<p>You know, PowerPoints were created,</p>
<p>teams of people were brought together</p>
<p>and, you know, people were practicing this.</p>
<p>We had all these, you know,</p>
<p>different people there.</p>
<p>And I said, look,</p>
<p>Henry Kissinger is an academic</p>
<p>and a former professor.</p>
<p>And, you know, I happened to,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;ve got to watch him in action.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to like,</p>
<p>you know, five seconds in,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re lucky we get that far,</p>
<p>ask us a question</p>
<p>and just throw off our entire presentation.</p>
<p>What is it that we want to convey?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what happened.</p>
<p>And then, you know,</p>
<p>people aren&rsquo;t really prepared</p>
<p>what they wanted to convey.</p>
<p>And they, you know, they prepared a,</p>
<p>you know, a nice sort of fulsome,</p>
<p>you know, PowerPoint like approach.</p>
<p>We never even got there.</p>
<p>And so God knows what, you know,</p>
<p>he took away from it at the end of it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know, think about Putin.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to be kind of impatient.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, you know, we see the televised things</p>
<p>where he, you know, kind of sits at a table</p>
<p>a bit like, you know,</p>
<p>people won&rsquo;t necessarily see us here.</p>
<p>And he puts his hands on the table</p>
<p>and he looks across at the person</p>
<p>and he says, so tell me,</p>
<p>you know, what&rsquo;s the main things I need to know?</p>
<p>And of course the person&rsquo;s mind</p>
<p>probably goes blank,</p>
<p>you know, with the kind of the thought of like,</p>
<p>oh God, what&rsquo;s the main thing?</p>
<p>And they go and they start,</p>
<p>well, Vladimir Vladimirovich.</p>
<p>And, you know, they start the kind of,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re revving up,</p>
<p>you know, to get to the point</p>
<p>and then he cuts them off.</p>
<p>So you think about that</p>
<p>and then you think about,</p>
<p>well, what information has he got?</p>
<p>And then how does he process it?</p>
<p>And is he suspicious of it?</p>
<p>Does he not believe it?</p>
<p>And what inside of his own history then,</p>
<p>you know, leads him to make</p>
<p>one judgment over another.</p>
<p>He clearly thought the Ukrainians</p>
<p>would fall apart in five seconds.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know if he clearly thought that,</p>
<p>but that there was a high probability, maybe.</p>
<p>I mean, you can guess.</p>
<p>Oh, I think he pretty much thought it</p>
<p>because I think he thought that,</p>
<p>you know, kind of,</p>
<p>Zelensky wasn&rsquo;t very popular.</p>
<p>There was an awful lot of,</p>
<p>you know, pro-Russian sentiment</p>
<p>in whatever way he thinks that is</p>
<p>because people are Russian speakers</p>
<p>and that, you know, they&rsquo;re kind of,</p>
<p>you know, in polling that,</p>
<p>you know, they expressed affinity with Russia.</p>
<p>I mean, certainly in Crimea</p>
<p>that worked out</p>
<p>because a majority of the population had,</p>
<p>you know, higher sentiments</p>
<p>or feelings of affinity with Russia.</p>
<p>And, you know, obviously,</p>
<p>you know, that kind of,</p>
<p>they got traction there.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s more complicated.</p>
<p>We talked about Donbass before,</p>
<p>about being a kind of melting pot</p>
<p>when, you know, they tried the same thing in Donbass.</p>
<p>Donetsk and Luhansk,</p>
<p>as they tried in Crimea in 2014,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t kind of pan out.</p>
<p>In fact, you know, a whole wall broke out.</p>
<p>They tried, you know, to kind of in,</p>
<p>you know, many of the major cities</p>
<p>that are now under attack,</p>
<p>including Odessa,</p>
<p>to kind of foment,</p>
<p>you know, pro-Russian movements.</p>
<p>And they completely and utterly fell apart.</p>
<p>So Putin was thinking,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m pretty sure based on polling</p>
<p>and the FSB having infiltrated,</p>
<p>you know, an awful lot of the Ukrainian hierarchies</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re now seeing is quite apparent</p>
<p>with some of the dismissals in Ukraine.</p>
<p>He was pretty sure that,</p>
<p>you know, kind of he would get traction</p>
<p>and that it would be like 1956 in Hungary</p>
<p>or 1968 in Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>Remember, he comes out of the Andropov levy,</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>the kind of cohort of people</p>
<p>who come into the KGB under Yuri Andropov.</p>
<p>And Yuri Andropov has presided</p>
<p>over a lot of these anti-dissident,</p>
<p>you know, kind of movements</p>
<p>inside of Russia itself</p>
<p>and how you suppress opposition,</p>
<p>but also over, you know,</p>
<p>how you deal with, you know,</p>
<p>kind of the uprisings in,</p>
<p>you know, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all these lessons from this</p>
<p>that, you know,</p>
<p>you can put everything back in the box.</p>
<p>And yeah, there might be a bit of violence</p>
<p>and a bit of fighting,</p>
<p>but ultimately you think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got the political figures</p>
<p>and you decapitate the opposition.</p>
<p>So they thought Zelensky would run away.</p>
<p>Yadokovich ran away,</p>
<p>but, you know, that was kind of a bit,</p>
<p>you know, sort of a different</p>
<p>set of circumstances.</p>
<p>And they thought that</p>
<p>all of the local governments</p>
<p>would, you know, kind of capitulate</p>
<p>because they had enough Russians</p>
<p>and inverted commas in there.</p>
<p>Again, mistaking language</p>
<p>and, you know, kind of positive affinity</p>
<p>towards Russia for identity</p>
<p>or how people would react in the time</p>
<p>and not understanding people&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, linkages and, you know,</p>
<p>kind of importance of place,</p>
<p>the way that people feel about</p>
<p>who they are in a certain</p>
<p>sort of circumstance in a place.</p>
<p>But the invasion of Ukraine in 2022</p>
<p>is unlike anything</p>
<p>that he was ever involved with.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he thought it would be,</p>
<p>you know, because it&rsquo;s this kind of,</p>
<p>if he looks back into the past,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right though,</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t involved in 68 or 56</p>
<p>or what happened in the 1980s in Poland.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a very wide front</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the capital and,</p>
<p>I mean, this isn&rsquo;t going for&hellip;</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t Chechnya,</p>
<p>or this isn&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>kind of Syria or for example.</p>
<p>This is a major nation.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Like a large, it&rsquo;s large, the size.</p>
<p>It was more like Afghanistan,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t realize that</p>
<p>because again, Ukrainians are us.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this kind of inability</p>
<p>to think that people</p>
<p>might think differently</p>
<p>and might want something different.</p>
<p>And that 30 years of independence,</p>
<p>actually has an impact on people</p>
<p>and their psyches.</p>
<p>And if I look back to the 1990s,</p>
<p>I mean, I remember being in seminars</p>
<p>and at Harvard at the time,</p>
<p>and we were doing a lot of research on,</p>
<p>you know, what was happening</p>
<p>in the former Soviet Union at the time,</p>
<p>because the early 1990s,</p>
<p>just after the whole place fell apart.</p>
<p>And there was already under Yeltsin,</p>
<p>this kind of idea of Russians abroad,</p>
<p>Russians in the near abroad,</p>
<p>Russian speakers,</p>
<p>and the need to bring them back in.</p>
<p>And I remember, you know,</p>
<p>we had seminars at the time</p>
<p>where we talked about at some point,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;d be some people in Russia</p>
<p>that would actually believe that</p>
<p>those Russian speakers</p>
<p>needed to be brought back into Russia,</p>
<p>but that the people who spoke Russian</p>
<p>might have moved on</p>
<p>because they suddenly had other opportunities</p>
<p>and other windows on the world.</p>
<p>I mean, look what&rsquo;s happened in Scotland.</p>
<p>You know, for example,</p>
<p>most people in Scotland speak English.</p>
<p>The Scottish language is not</p>
<p>the standard bearer of Scottish identity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s almost a civic identity,</p>
<p>a different identity</p>
<p>than not just national identity,</p>
<p>just like you see in Ukraine.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s lots of English people</p>
<p>that moved to Scotland</p>
<p>and now think of themselves as Scottish,</p>
<p>or Brazilians, or Italians,</p>
<p>and, you know, all kinds of people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve moved in there.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a smaller population,</p>
<p>obviously, and it&rsquo;s not the scale of Ukraine,</p>
<p>but, you know, people feel differently.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been a devolution of power.</p>
<p>And when Brexit happened,</p>
<p>you know, Scotland didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to go along with that at all.</p>
<p>And they wanted to kind of still be,</p>
<p>you know, having a window on Europe.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of historic.</p>
<p>And lots of people in Ukraine</p>
<p>have looked west, not east.</p>
<p>You know, it depends on where you are,</p>
<p>not just in Lviv, you know,</p>
<p>or somewhere like that,</p>
<p>but also in Kyiv.</p>
<p>And Kharkiv, you know,</p>
<p>was kind of predominantly</p>
<p>a Russian-speaking city.</p>
<p>But Kharkiv was also the centre</p>
<p>of Ukrainian culture</p>
<p>and Ukrainian literature,</p>
<p>you know, at different points.</p>
<p>People have different views.</p>
<p>I grew up in the north of England.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t feel like the south of England.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a massive divide</p>
<p>between north and south in England</p>
<p>for millennia, not just centuries.</p>
<p>So, you know, people feel differently</p>
<p>depending on where they live</p>
<p>and, you know, kind of where they grew up.</p>
<p>And Putin just didn&rsquo;t see that.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t see that.</p>
<p>Well, hold on a second.</p>
<p>Let me sort of push back</p>
<p>at the fact that I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>any of this is obvious.</p>
<p>So first of all, Zelensky</p>
<p>before the war was unpopular.</p>
<p>Oh, he was, wasn&rsquo;t he?</p>
<p>38%, something like that,</p>
<p>but best in the popularity.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let me sort of make the case</p>
<p>that the calculation here</p>
<p>is very difficult.</p>
<p>If you were to poll</p>
<p>every citizen of Ukraine</p>
<p>and ask them,</p>
<p>what do you think happens</p>
<p>if Russia invades?</p>
<p>Just like actually each,</p>
<p>put each individual Ukrainian</p>
<p>in a one-on-one meeting with Putin</p>
<p>and say, what do you think happens?</p>
<p>I honestly think most of them will say</p>
<p>they will agree with the prediction</p>
<p>that the government would flee,</p>
<p>it would collapse.</p>
<p>And the country won&rsquo;t unite</p>
<p>around the cause</p>
<p>because of the factions,</p>
<p>because of all the different parties involved,</p>
<p>because of the unpopularity.</p>
<p>You might have said the same thing</p>
<p>about the Soviet Union</p>
<p>when Hitler invaded in 1941.</p>
<p>You see, the problem is Putin</p>
<p>always reads history</p>
<p>from one perspective over another.</p>
<p>I think most countries</p>
<p>basically rise to their own defense.</p>
<p>So this is actually one of the first times</p>
<p>that Russia has been on the offensive</p>
<p>rather than on the defensive.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s kind of a bit of a flip there.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously Afghanistan,</p>
<p>but that was more complicated</p>
<p>because it was also supposed</p>
<p>to be an intervention, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be</p>
<p>to annex Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It was to try to prop up</p>
<p>or reinstall a leader there.</p>
<p>Syria, you were in there</p>
<p>to help your guy, Bashar al-Assad,</p>
<p>turn away the opposition.</p>
<p>Chechnya was a debacle.</p>
<p>The Chechens fought back big time.</p>
<p>And it was only by dint of</p>
<p>horrible, violent persistence</p>
<p>and ruthlessness and nasty, dirty tricks</p>
<p>that Putin prevailed there.</p>
<p>But then you wonder, did he prevail?</p>
<p>Because what happened?</p>
<p>Chechnya sometimes describes</p>
<p>the most independent part</p>
<p>of the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>And Ramzan Kadyrov plays power games in Moscow.</p>
<p>His predecessors, even his father</p>
<p>and others wouldn&rsquo;t have done that.</p>
<p>Ahmed Kadyrov, and before that,</p>
<p>Dudayev and Maskhadov,</p>
<p>I mean, they were willing</p>
<p>to make a compromise,</p>
<p>but they wouldn&rsquo;t have had</p>
<p>the same position that Kadyrov has had.</p>
<p>So I think that, again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s your perspective</p>
<p>and where you stand</p>
<p>and which bit of history you start to read.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I said that,</p>
<p>I think Putin, it&rsquo;s again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the information,</p>
<p>the way that he processes it.</p>
<p>I think most Russians also can&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve done something wrong in Ukraine.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe at this point,</p>
<p>things are changing a bit,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why there was</p>
<p>so much kind of support for this,</p>
<p>in a right way.</p>
<p>I mean, I have Russian friends,</p>
<p>again, to say, but look what</p>
<p>was happening in Donetsk.</p>
<p>Look what the Ukrainians</p>
<p>were doing to our guys.</p>
<p>You know, look what was happening</p>
<p>to Russian speakers.</p>
<p>You know, we were defenders.</p>
<p>We were not, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not invaders.</p>
<p>I think, again,</p>
<p>the special military operation idea.</p>
<p>Now, I think it&rsquo;s flipping, obviously,</p>
<p>in the way that,</p>
<p>with the war going on there.</p>
<p>But Putin wasn&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>kind of looking at what would happen.</p>
<p>I mean, most of the kind of glory parts</p>
<p>of Russian history,</p>
<p>when you kind of go in,</p>
<p>you know, you chase Napoleon back to Paris,</p>
<p>or you chase the Germans back to Berlin,</p>
<p>you put the flag above the Reichstag.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very different set of affairs.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;ve been fighting a defensive one,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been invaded from a war</p>
<p>where you invade someone else.</p>
<p>And even the most fractured populations,</p>
<p>like you had in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>the rally round and, you know,</p>
<p>World War I, that fell apart.</p>
<p>I mean, the Tsar didn&rsquo;t manage</p>
<p>to rally everybody around.</p>
<p>I mean, the whole thing fell apart.</p>
<p>And World War II,</p>
<p>Stalin had to, you know,</p>
<p>revive nationalism,</p>
<p>including in the republics,</p>
<p>in Central Asia and elsewhere,</p>
<p>to revive nationalism.</p>
<p>And Ukraine suddenly found nationalism,</p>
<p>you know, in a kind of sense.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not obvious,</p>
<p>especially what Ukrainians</p>
<p>went through in the 1930s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not obvious that that&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, my grandfather was Ukrainian</p>
<p>and he was proud to fight a Ukrainian Jew.</p>
<p>He was proud to fight</p>
<p>and willing to die for his country.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like&hellip;</p>
<p>His country then was the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union, right.</p>
<p>Sorry, to clarify.</p>
<p>But he might fight now</p>
<p>for his country, Ukraine.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just, like,</p>
<p>lingering on the point you made.</p>
<p>It was not obvious</p>
<p>that that united feeling would be there.</p>
<p>No, and again,</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t have been obvious</p>
<p>with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>Sorry, I was referring to my grandfather</p>
<p>with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re both saying the exact same thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, we know.</p>
<p>Yeah, we are.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s a really powerful thing,</p>
<p>because I take it,</p>
<p>because you take history as it happened,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>it could have happened differently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that whole counterfactual, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because, I mean, if you&rsquo;ve kind of,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why we all need in the United States</p>
<p>to really examine our own history.</p>
<p>Because, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of lessons from that.</p>
<p>That, you know, we should treat very cautiously.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that, you know,</p>
<p>history repeats or even rhymes,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s the old axiom all the time.</p>
<p>But there are a lot of things</p>
<p>that you can take away differently</p>
<p>from putting a different perspective</p>
<p>in a different slant</p>
<p>on the same set of events.</p>
<p>I mean, I always used to wonder, like,</p>
<p>how many books can be written</p>
<p>on the French Revolution,</p>
<p>or even on the Russian Revolution?</p>
<p>You know, I studied with Richard Pipes.</p>
<p>I remember he was really offended</p>
<p>after he&rsquo;d written his great</p>
<p>Microcerpus on the Russian Revolution,</p>
<p>two volumes that other people would,</p>
<p>you know, kind of write about</p>
<p>the Russian Revolution.</p>
<p>He said, I&rsquo;ve written it all.</p>
<p>And I thought, well, actually,</p>
<p>maybe you haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there might be</p>
<p>some completely different angle there</p>
<p>that you haven&rsquo;t really thought of.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s Putin.</p>
<p>You know, I remember Peskov saying,</p>
<p>Putin reads history all the time,</p>
<p>Russian history.</p>
<p>And I thought, well,</p>
<p>maybe you should read some world history.</p>
<p>You know, maybe he should,</p>
<p>you know, kind of read</p>
<p>some European authors</p>
<p>on Russian history,</p>
<p>not just, you know, reading Lamanossa</p>
<p>for, you know, Russian historians</p>
<p>on Russian history.</p>
<p>Because you might see something</p>
<p>from a very different perspective.</p>
<p>Look, and the United States</p>
<p>made a massive mistake in Vietnam, right?</p>
<p>I mean, they saw Vietnam</p>
<p>as kind of weak,</p>
<p>manipulated by, you know,</p>
<p>kind of external forces,</p>
<p>China, Soviet Union.</p>
<p>But the Vietnamese fought</p>
<p>for their own country.</p>
<p>They suddenly became Vietnamese.</p>
<p>And Ho Chi Minh became,</p>
<p>you know, kind of basically</p>
<p>a kind of a wartime fighter and leader,</p>
<p>you know, in a way that, you know,</p>
<p>perhaps people wouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>understood either.</p>
<p>You said the United States</p>
<p>made a massive mistake in Vietnam.</p>
<p>And that, for some reason,</p>
<p>sprung a thought in my head.</p>
<p>Has the United States,</p>
<p>since World War II,</p>
<p>had anything that&rsquo;s not a mistake</p>
<p>in terms of military operations abroad?</p>
<p>I suppose all the ones</p>
<p>that are successes,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t even know about, probably.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like very fast</p>
<p>military operations.</p>
<p>I mean, Korea&rsquo;s divided.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s successful,</p>
<p>but, you know, kind of,</p>
<p>I mean, there was a solution found</p>
<p>that, you know, some people</p>
<p>are promoting, you know,</p>
<p>in this case as well,</p>
<p>of a sort of division and a,</p>
<p>you know, the DMZ and,</p>
<p>you know, one side over the other</p>
<p>and, you know, kind of perpetuating</p>
<p>a division, which I think</p>
<p>is particularly successful.</p>
<p>But if you think about World War I</p>
<p>and World War II,</p>
<p>the United States came in,</p>
<p>you know, under some very specific</p>
<p>sets of circumstances.</p>
<p>In World War I,</p>
<p>they did kind of come in to help,</p>
<p>you know, kind of liberate,</p>
<p>you know, parts of Europe, France,</p>
<p>and, you know, kind of the UK</p>
<p>and, you know, everything else,</p>
<p>Great Britain and the war</p>
<p>towards the end of it.</p>
<p>World War II, you know,</p>
<p>there was that whole debate</p>
<p>about whether the United States</p>
<p>should even be part of the war.</p>
<p>I mean, we know it wasn&rsquo;t thought to,</p>
<p>you know, overturn the Holocaust</p>
<p>and all of the kind of things</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d kind of wish</p>
<p>it would been fought for,</p>
<p>but it was because of Pearl Harbor</p>
<p>and, you know, the Japanese pulling in.</p>
<p>But, you know, ultimately,</p>
<p>it was easy to explain</p>
<p>why you were there,</p>
<p>you know, particularly after Pearl Harbor</p>
<p>and what had happened.</p>
<p>It was harder to explain Vietnam</p>
<p>and Korea and, you know,</p>
<p>many of the other wars.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of going to be</p>
<p>a problem for Putin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why there is a problem for Putin.</p>
<p>All of his explanations</p>
<p>have been questioned,</p>
<p>you know, sort of off on NATO</p>
<p>or this or that or the other.</p>
<p>And, you know, kind of liberating,</p>
<p>you know, Ukraine from Nazis</p>
<p>or, you know, kind of basically</p>
<p>stopping the persecution</p>
<p>of Russian speakers.</p>
<p>And all of this has now got lost</p>
<p>in just this horrific destruction.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what happened</p>
<p>in Vietnam as well.</p>
<p>It became, you know,</p>
<p>a great degradation</p>
<p>of the Russian military</p>
<p>with atrocities</p>
<p>and people wondering</p>
<p>why on earth the United States</p>
<p>was in Vietnam.</p>
<p>I mean, even that kind of happened</p>
<p>in Britain in the colonial,</p>
<p>you know, kind of period as well.</p>
<p>Why was the United Kingdom</p>
<p>doing, you know, committing atrocities</p>
<p>and, you know, kind of basically</p>
<p>fighting these colonial wars?</p>
<p>Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Why was the United Kingdom still,</p>
<p>you know, kind of militarily</p>
<p>occupying Ireland?</p>
<p>Cyprus.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of, you know,</p>
<p>instances where we look at this thing.</p>
<p>So what Russia is doing now,</p>
<p>Putin is trying to occupy</p>
<p>another country,</p>
<p>irrespective of, you know,</p>
<p>kind of the historical linkages</p>
<p>and, you know, the kind of</p>
<p>the larger metanarratives</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s trying to put forward there.</p>
<p>What role did the United States play</p>
<p>in the lead up</p>
<p>and the actual invasion</p>
<p>of Ukraine by Russia?</p>
<p>A lot of people say that,</p>
<p>I mean, obviously,</p>
<p>Vladimir Putin says</p>
<p>that part of the reason</p>
<p>the invasion had to happen</p>
<p>is because of security concerns</p>
<p>over the expansion of NATO.</p>
<p>And there is a lot of people</p>
<p>that say that this was provoked by NATO.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s some legitimacy</p>
<p>to that case?</p>
<p>Look, I think the whole situation</p>
<p>here is very complicated</p>
<p>and you have to take a much longer view</p>
<p>than, you know, what happened in,</p>
<p>you know, 2008 with the open door</p>
<p>for Ukraine and Georgia,</p>
<p>which actually, by the way,</p>
<p>I thought was a strategic blunder,</p>
<p>just to be very clear,</p>
<p>because it wasn&rsquo;t any kind of</p>
<p>thinking through about</p>
<p>what the implications of that would be</p>
<p>and, you know, what it actually would mean</p>
<p>for Ukraine&rsquo;s security.</p>
<p>And also bearing in mind</p>
<p>what Putin had already said</p>
<p>about NATO expansion,</p>
<p>they came on the wake</p>
<p>of the recognition by the United States</p>
<p>pretty unilaterally of Kosovo.</p>
<p>And it also comes in the wake</p>
<p>of what I mentioned before,</p>
<p>the invasion of Iraq,</p>
<p>which really is very</p>
<p>important for understanding Putin&rsquo;s psyche.</p>
<p>So I think, you know,</p>
<p>we have to go back,</p>
<p>you know, much further</p>
<p>than it&rsquo;s not just talking about</p>
<p>kind of NATO and what that means.</p>
<p>NATO is part of the whole</p>
<p>package of Ukraine</p>
<p>going in a different direction from Russia,</p>
<p>just as so is the European Union.</p>
<p>Remember, the annexation of Crimea</p>
<p>comes after Ukraine has sought</p>
<p>an association agreement</p>
<p>with the European Union,</p>
<p>not with NATO at that particular point,</p>
<p>even though, you know,</p>
<p>the EU on the security,</p>
<p>common security and defence policy</p>
<p>basically has all kinds of connections</p>
<p>with NATO, you know,</p>
<p>various different levels</p>
<p>in the European security front.</p>
<p>It was all about Europe</p>
<p>and going on a different economic</p>
<p>and political and ultimately legal path.</p>
<p>Because if you have</p>
<p>an association agreement,</p>
<p>eventually you get into the Akiko Militaire</p>
<p>and it just transforms the country completely</p>
<p>and Ukraine is no longer</p>
<p>the Ukraine of the Soviet period</p>
<p>or the Russian Empire period.</p>
<p>It becomes, you know,</p>
<p>on a different trajectory,</p>
<p>like Czech Republic,</p>
<p>Slovakia, Poland,</p>
<p>another country.</p>
<p>It becomes a different place.</p>
<p>It moves into a different space</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s part of it.</p>
<p>But if you go back again</p>
<p>to the period at the very beginning</p>
<p>of the 1990s,</p>
<p>after the dissolution</p>
<p>of the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s no discussion</p>
<p>about NATO at that point</p>
<p>and NATO enlargement,</p>
<p>there was a lot of pressure again,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ve said before,</p>
<p>by nationalist elements on Ukraine</p>
<p>trying to bring it back in the fold</p>
<p>and wanting to make what was then,</p>
<p>you know, this mechanism for divorce</p>
<p>more of a mechanism for re-managed</p>
<p>Commonwealth of Independent States.</p>
<p>And in the early 1990s,</p>
<p>when Ukraine became an independent state,</p>
<p>it inherited that nuclear arsenal.</p>
<p>From the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>basically whatever was stationed</p>
<p>or positioned in Ukrainian territory</p>
<p>at the time became Ukraine&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Strategic and, you know,</p>
<p>kind of basically intermediate</p>
<p>and tactical nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>And, you know, in the United States</p>
<p>at the time,</p>
<p>we had all this panic about</p>
<p>what was going to happen</p>
<p>with all of that.</p>
<p>I mean, I think, you know,</p>
<p>it was a scientist</p>
<p>and kind of technically</p>
<p>it would have been difficult</p>
<p>for Ukraine to actually use this.</p>
<p>I mean, the targeting was,</p>
<p>you know, done centrally.</p>
<p>They were actually stationed there.</p>
<p>But nonetheless,</p>
<p>Ukraine, like Belarus and Kazakhstan,</p>
<p>suddenly became nuclear powers.</p>
<p>And, you know, Ash Carter,</p>
<p>the former U.S. defense secretary</p>
<p>who just died tragically</p>
<p>in what Dave was talking about,</p>
<p>you know, talking together today</p>
<p>was part of a whole team of Americans</p>
<p>and others who, you know,</p>
<p>tried to work with Ukraine,</p>
<p>Belarus and Kazakhstan</p>
<p>to get them to give up</p>
<p>the nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>And back in the early period of that,</p>
<p>93, 94, you go back.</p>
<p>And I mean, I was writing</p>
<p>about this at the time.</p>
<p>I wrote a report called</p>
<p>Back in the USSR,</p>
<p>which is, you know,</p>
<p>kind of on the website</p>
<p>of the Kennedy School</p>
<p>with some other colleagues.</p>
<p>And we were monitoring</p>
<p>how there was all these accusations</p>
<p>coming out of Moscow,</p>
<p>the defense ministry</p>
<p>and the Duma, the parliament</p>
<p>and others that Ukraine</p>
<p>was trying to find a way</p>
<p>of making a dirty bomb,</p>
<p>using its nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>you know, becoming a menace</p>
<p>and, you know, kind of Ukraine</p>
<p>might have to be brought to order.</p>
<p>So a lot of the dynamics</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing now</p>
<p>were happening then,</p>
<p>irrespective of NATO.</p>
<p>Basically, the problem</p>
<p>was always Ukraine getting away.</p>
<p>Yeltsin himself,</p>
<p>when he unraveled the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t really want it to unravel,</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t have the wherewithal</p>
<p>to bring, you know,</p>
<p>the countries back again.</p>
<p>Russia was weak</p>
<p>after the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Its economy imploded.</p>
<p>It had to give sovereignty</p>
<p>to all of these constituent parts</p>
<p>of the Russian Federation</p>
<p>in terms of a sort of</p>
<p>devolution of authority.</p>
<p>It had the war in Chechnya,</p>
<p>which Yeltsin stupidly</p>
<p>sparked off in 1994.</p>
<p>You had Tatarstan,</p>
<p>one of the regions,</p>
<p>the all-rich regions,</p>
<p>you know, basically</p>
<p>resting out a kind of</p>
<p>a bilateral treaty with Moscow.</p>
<p>The whole place was kind of</p>
<p>seemed like it was falling apart</p>
<p>so that, you know,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t do anything on Ukraine</p>
<p>because you didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the wherewithal to do it.</p>
<p>And then when, you know,</p>
<p>kind of basically Russia</p>
<p>starts to get its act</p>
<p>back together again,</p>
<p>all of these security</p>
<p>nationalist types</p>
<p>who had never wanted Ukraine</p>
<p>or Belarus or Moldova</p>
<p>or anywhere else</p>
<p>to kind of move away,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t worry that much</p>
<p>about Central Asia, to be frank.</p>
<p>But, you know, they did want,</p>
<p>you know, the core states</p>
<p>in their view to come back.</p>
<p>And Moldova was part of that,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s not Slavic.</p>
<p>But, you know, they wanted Belarus</p>
<p>and northern Kazakhstan</p>
<p>and probably Kazakhstan as well,</p>
<p>which wasn&rsquo;t really thought about</p>
<p>being part of Central Asia,</p>
<p>back in the fold as close as possible.</p>
<p>So anything that gave</p>
<p>those countries an alternative</p>
<p>was seen as negative.</p>
<p>And it, you know,</p>
<p>could have been an association</p>
<p>with China, you know,</p>
<p>of them joining,</p>
<p>you know, kind of an association</p>
<p>with Latin America or Africa</p>
<p>or something else like that.</p>
<p>But, of course, NATO</p>
<p>has all of those larger connotations</p>
<p>of it being, you know,</p>
<p>the Cold War opposing entity.</p>
<p>And Putin has always seen NATO</p>
<p>as being the direct correlation</p>
<p>of the Warsaw Pact,</p>
<p>which is, in other words,</p>
<p>just something dominated</p>
<p>completely by the United States.</p>
<p>Now, that, of course,</p>
<p>is why getting back to Trump again,</p>
<p>Trump was always going,</p>
<p>you know, to the Europeans,</p>
<p>if this is really supposed</p>
<p>to be collective security</p>
<p>in a mutual defence pact,</p>
<p>why are you guys not paying?</p>
<p>You know, why does the United States</p>
<p>pay for everything?</p>
<p>But, you know, NATO was actually</p>
<p>conceived as collective defence,</p>
<p>you know, mutual security.</p>
<p>And it was set up by,</p>
<p>you know, the United States,</p>
<p>along with the UK and France</p>
<p>and, you know, Germany and Turkey</p>
<p>and, you know, other countries.</p>
<p>And we see that now</p>
<p>with the entry of Finland and Sweden.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have to join NATO.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t want to join NATO</p>
<p>for a long time.</p>
<p>They wanted to partner with it,</p>
<p>just like Israel</p>
<p>and the other countries</p>
<p>partner with NATO.</p>
<p>But once they thought</p>
<p>that their security</p>
<p>was really at risk,</p>
<p>they wanted to be part of it.</p>
<p>And so, you know,</p>
<p>kind of you&rsquo;re now really seeing,</p>
<p>you know, that NATO</p>
<p>is something other than just being,</p>
<p>you know, a creature</p>
<p>or an instrument</p>
<p>of the United States.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s how Putin always saw it.</p>
<p>So, you know, what this debate</p>
<p>about NATO is all about,</p>
<p>or Russia being provoked,</p>
<p>is wanting to kind of return</p>
<p>to an old superpower,</p>
<p>bipolar relationship</p>
<p>where everything is negotiated</p>
<p>with the United States.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to try to deny</p>
<p>that Ukraine or Belarus,</p>
<p>well, Belarus has kind of been</p>
<p>absorbed by this point,</p>
<p>you know, by Russia or Moldova</p>
<p>or Kazakhstan</p>
<p>or any of the other countries</p>
<p>have any kind of agency.</p>
<p>Not even Poland or Hungary</p>
<p>or, you know, kind of France and Britain.</p>
<p>For years and years and years,</p>
<p>senior people like Putin</p>
<p>and people around the Kremlin</p>
<p>have demanded a return</p>
<p>to the kind of what they call</p>
<p>the old concert of Europe</p>
<p>or the concert of Vienna,</p>
<p>where the big guys,</p>
<p>which now means the United States,</p>
<p>and Russia just sit down</p>
<p>and thrash everything out.</p>
<p>And so, I mean,</p>
<p>Putin by saying,</p>
<p>look, it was provoked,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the United States,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s NATO,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a proxy war</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s this or it&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>or this is going to be</p>
<p>a nuclear confrontation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Cuban Missile Crisis</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s the Euro Missile Crisis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically just saying,</p>
<p>you know, I want to go back</p>
<p>to when the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>the United States worked things out.</p>
<p>I want to go back to the whole,</p>
<p>you know, period of the 1980s</p>
<p>when Gorbachev and Reagan</p>
<p>just kind of got together</p>
<p>and figured things out.</p>
<p>Or, even better,</p>
<p>back to Yalta, Potsdam and Tehran</p>
<p>and the big, you know, meetings</p>
<p>at the end of World War II</p>
<p>where we resolved</p>
<p>the whole future security.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had a war,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had the Cold War,</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;ve got another war.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a real war, a hot war.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>It should be the United States</p>
<p>and Russia that sort this out.</p>
<p>So this is where we see</p>
<p>the United States waffling about as well,</p>
<p>trying to kind of like figure out</p>
<p>how to handle this,</p>
<p>because it has to be handled</p>
<p>in a way that Ukraine has agency.</p>
<p>Because if Ukraine doesn&rsquo;t have agency,</p>
<p>nobody else has agency either.</p>
<p>Nobody else has any kind of</p>
<p>decision-making power.</p>
<p>And, you know, we have an environment</p>
<p>in which Putin thinks</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s only really three players.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the United States</p>
<p>and Russia and China.</p>
<p>And maybe occasionally it might be India</p>
<p>and perhaps Brazil</p>
<p>or some other South Africa</p>
<p>or some other country,</p>
<p>like maybe the BRICS at some point.</p>
<p>But, you know, ultimately</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the old days.</p>
<p>Big powers resolve everything.</p>
<p>And so this war is also about</p>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s right, Putin&rsquo;s right,</p>
<p>you know, to determine things</p>
<p>you know, strong man to strong man,</p>
<p>big country to big country,</p>
<p>and, you know, determine,</p>
<p>you know, where things happen next.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s talking about</p>
<p>things being provoked</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s being the United States&rsquo; fault.</p>
<p>But aren&rsquo;t there parts</p>
<p>of the United States</p>
<p>establishment that likes that kind of</p>
<p>three-party view of the world?</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s always going to be people</p>
<p>who like that part, that approach.</p>
<p>Of course there is.</p>
<p>But then they don&rsquo;t necessarily dominate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of thing</p>
<p>that people kind of think about.</p>
<p>Putin can, you know, read,</p>
<p>you know, all the various articles</p>
<p>and hear the kind of pronouncements of people.</p>
<p>But, you know, this gets back to,</p>
<p>you know, the way that</p>
<p>the United States operates.</p>
<p>You know, Putin saw that, you know,</p>
<p>Trump wanted to have a, you know,</p>
<p>top-down, you know, vertical of power.</p>
<p>And other presidents have wanted to have that.</p>
<p>But the United States</p>
<p>is a pretty messy place.</p>
<p>And we have all kinds</p>
<p>of different viewpoints.</p>
<p>Now, of course, we know that in Russia,</p>
<p>everything, even criticism of the Kremlin</p>
<p>is usually fairly orchestrated,</p>
<p>usually to kind of flush out,</p>
<p>you know, what people think about things.</p>
<p>When we had these hardliners saying,</p>
<p>you know, we needed more destruction</p>
<p>of Ukraine, not less.</p>
<p>And that, you know,</p>
<p>the army wasn&rsquo;t doing enough.</p>
<p>It was in many respects, you know,</p>
<p>kind of encouraged by the Kremlin</p>
<p>to see how people would react to that,</p>
<p>you know, to kind of actually create</p>
<p>a constituency for, you know,</p>
<p>being more ruthless than you had before,</p>
<p>because, you know,</p>
<p>they wanted to clamp down.</p>
<p>In the United States,</p>
<p>I mean, I can say whatever I want.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;m speaking</p>
<p>on behalf of the White House.</p>
<p>And, you know, even if I have been</p>
<p>an advisor to this president,</p>
<p>that president and the other,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m, you know,</p>
<p>basically speaking on behalf</p>
<p>of the U.S. government.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s kind of always</p>
<p>an assumption from the Russians</p>
<p>that, you know, when people,</p>
<p>you know, say this and people</p>
<p>do advocate one thing over another,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s operating.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of mirror imaging,</p>
<p>thinking that, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re operating in the same kind of way.</p>
<p>So, yes, there are, of course,</p>
<p>constituencies who think like that</p>
<p>and would love it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s back to that.</p>
<p>And there are many people out there</p>
<p>with their own peace plans.</p>
<p>All kinds of people, you know,</p>
<p>out there trying to push this.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there does seem to be,</p>
<p>the engine of the military-industrial complex</p>
<p>seems to give some fuel to the hawks.</p>
<p>And they seem to create momentum</p>
<p>in government.</p>
<p>Yeah, but other people do, too.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s always, you know,</p>
<p>kind of a check something again.</p>
<p>You believe in the tension of ideas.</p>
<p>I think there is a lot of tension.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve seen it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it inside of the government now,</p>
<p>you know, and people can push back.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I speak out.</p>
<p>And I try to lay it out</p>
<p>so that everybody can, you know,</p>
<p>kind of figure it out for themselves.</p>
<p>I said the same to you as I say to everybody.</p>
<p>This is how I see the situation.</p>
<p>And, you know, this is, you know,</p>
<p>how we can analyze it here.</p>
<p>Now, look, do I think that we&rsquo;ve handled,</p>
<p>you know, the whole Russia account,</p>
<p>you know, for years?</p>
<p>Well, no, we haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve taken our eyes off the ball many times.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve failed to understand the way</p>
<p>that people like Putin think.</p>
<p>You know, you talked earlier about,</p>
<p>you know, we need to have empathy for,</p>
<p>you know, all the people who like Trump</p>
<p>or like Biden and understand how they think.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to have strategic empathy</p>
<p>about Putin as well.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to understand how the guy thinks</p>
<p>and why he thinks like he does.</p>
<p>You know, he has got his own context</p>
<p>and his own frame and his own rationale.</p>
<p>And he is rational.</p>
<p>He is a rational actor in his own context.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to understand that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to understand that he would take offense</p>
<p>at something and he would take action over something.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean to say that,</p>
<p>you know, we are necessary to blame by taking actions,</p>
<p>but we are to blame when we don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>the consequences of things that we do</p>
<p>and act accordingly or, you know,</p>
<p>take preventative action or recognize</p>
<p>that something might happen as a result of something.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve been in the room with Putin.</p>
<p>Let me ask you for some advice.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also just a good philosophical question</p>
<p>for you or for me.</p>
<p>If I have a conversation with Vladimir Putin right now,</p>
<p>can you advise on what questions, topics,</p>
<p>ideas to talk through to him as a leader,</p>
<p>to him as a human?</p>
<p>What would you like to understand about his mind,</p>
<p>about his thinking?</p>
<p>Yeah, remember what I said before</p>
<p>that Putin always tries to, you know, reverse things.</p>
<p>He wants to hear the questions that people have.</p>
<p>Because remember, he himself at different points</p>
<p>has been a recruiter, which is, you know,</p>
<p>the way that you&rsquo;re operating now as well, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re asking an awful lot of questions.</p>
<p>Your questions also betray, you know,</p>
<p>often the times where you&rsquo;re thinking about things,</p>
<p>you know, the kind of context, you know,</p>
<p>kind of any kind of dialogue like this</p>
<p>reveals a lot about the, you know, the other person.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve actually often, you know,</p>
<p>noticed in these settings that Putin</p>
<p>likes to have a lot of give and take.</p>
<p>So I think he would actually enjoy</p>
<p>having a conversation, you know, with you.</p>
<p>But again, he would always be trying to influence you.</p>
<p>Inform and influence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of, you know, part of the way</p>
<p>that he always operates.</p>
<p>So what you would have to, you know,</p>
<p>be trying to think about,</p>
<p>so what is it you would want to elicit information from him?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to understand the guy&rsquo;s worldview.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;re trying to also understand</p>
<p>is if there&rsquo;s any room there</p>
<p>where he might compromise on something.</p>
<p>You know, so if your goal was to go in there,</p>
<p>you know, to talk about Ukraine at this particular moment,</p>
<p>I mean, one of the problems that I&rsquo;ve often seen</p>
<p>in the sort of the meetings we&rsquo;ve had with Putin,</p>
<p>it just ends up in sort of mutual recriminations.</p>
<p>You know, kind of, no, well, what about what you&rsquo;ve done?</p>
<p>Or no, you&rsquo;ve done that about, you know,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s always this whataboutism.</p>
<p>I mean, it often say, well,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying that I&rsquo;ve done this, but you&rsquo;ve done that.</p>
<p>The United States invaded Iraq.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between, you know,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m doing and all of the things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been doing here?</p>
<p>I mean, what you would have to try to do</p>
<p>is kind of elicit information about why,</p>
<p>or what he is thinking about this particular moment</p>
<p>in time and why he thinks it.</p>
<p>Yeah, the whataboutism is a failure case.</p>
<p>I think that shows,</p>
<p>from all the interviews I&rsquo;ve seen with him,</p>
<p>that just shows that he doesn&rsquo;t trust</p>
<p>the person on the other side.</p>
<p>No, he doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Right, but I&rsquo;m not cynical like people.</p>
<p>They seem to think he&rsquo;s some kind of KGB agent</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t trust anybody.</p>
<p>I disagree.</p>
<p>I think everybody&rsquo;s human.</p>
<p>And from my perspective,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m worried about what I&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>is I think whether it&rsquo;s COVID,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s other aspects that I&rsquo;m not aware of</p>
<p>leading up to the invasion,</p>
<p>he seems to be less willing to have</p>
<p>charismatic back and forth dialogue.</p>
<p>Yeah, an open discussion.</p>
<p>You know, actually, I mean, I said,</p>
<p>you asked me before about, you know,</p>
<p>that issue of trust,</p>
<p>and he often says he only trusts himself.</p>
<p>And I said, you know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s often distrustful of people,</p>
<p>but he does trust some people for certain things</p>
<p>where he knows it&rsquo;s within their competence.</p>
<p>So he has people he trusts to do things</p>
<p>because he knows they&rsquo;ll do them,</p>
<p>and he knows that they&rsquo;ll do them well,</p>
<p>which is why he has his old buddies</p>
<p>from St. Petersburg,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s known them for a very long time,</p>
<p>and he knows that they won&rsquo;t try to</p>
<p>pull a fast one over him,</p>
<p>but he also knows their strengths and their weaknesses</p>
<p>and what they can be trusted to do.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s learning that, you know,</p>
<p>some of the people in the military</p>
<p>that he thought were competent,</p>
<p>or people on other things are not, right?</p>
<p>And he tends to actually have a lot of loyalty</p>
<p>to people as well,</p>
<p>or he also kind of thinks it&rsquo;s best</p>
<p>to keep them inside the tent than outside,</p>
<p>and he moves them around.</p>
<p>You know, he kind of, okay, you know,</p>
<p>he gives them multiple chances</p>
<p>to redeem themselves if they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like he has them done in.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, there is a lot of that in the system,</p>
<p>but the people that he&rsquo;s worked with for a long time,</p>
<p>you know, he moves them around to something else,</p>
<p>perhaps where they can do less harm.</p>
<p>Although, you know, we often see that</p>
<p>he has quite a small cadre of people</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s reliant on,</p>
<p>and often, you know, they&rsquo;re not up to the task,</p>
<p>which is kind of what&rsquo;s happening here.</p>
<p>But he also, in the past,</p>
<p>has been more straightforward,</p>
<p>just like you were saying here,</p>
<p>more pragmatic.</p>
<p>And I think, you know,</p>
<p>if you were engaged with him in Russian,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re actually literally speaking the same language,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so much lost in translation.</p>
<p>I used to jump outside of my skin</p>
<p>listening to some of the phone calls,</p>
<p>because, you know, the way that they kind of relate,</p>
<p>you know, with an interpreter.</p>
<p>Oh, because you&rsquo;re listening to the translation?</p>
<p>No, because I know I&rsquo;m listening to the Russian</p>
<p>and the translation,</p>
<p>which is happening, you know, in real time.</p>
<p>And having been at a translators&rsquo; institute,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really difficult.</p>
<p>Look, an interpreter&rsquo;s a trend in the moment</p>
<p>to do something, you know,</p>
<p>the synchrony privo,</p>
<p>the synchronized or the real-time translation.</p>
<p>So translation is an art as well as a skill.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing simultaneous translation,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the word in English,</p>
<p>you know, synchrony privo in Russian,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of focused in the moment</p>
<p>on the fragments of the discussion,</p>
<p>trying to render it as accurately as you possibly can.</p>
<p>And when you come out of that,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t relay the entire conversation.</p>
<p>And often, you know, what translators do is they,</p>
<p>you know, they take this little short note</p>
<p>like journalists do.</p>
<p>And afterwards, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve just been caught up in the moment</p>
<p>and they haven&rsquo;t got the big picture.</p>
<p>Consecutive translation is different.</p>
<p>You know, kind of you&rsquo;re trying to convey</p>
<p>the whole mood of like big chunks of dialogue</p>
<p>that have already been there.</p>
<p>But, you know, sometimes you might not get that right either.</p>
<p>And it breaks up the flow of the discussion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>And often it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>the kind of the person who translates, it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>You know, some of our best translators are women.</p>
<p>But, you know, hearing a woman&rsquo;s voice,</p>
<p>you know, translating a guy</p>
<p>who has a particular guy&rsquo;s way of speaking</p>
<p>and a macho way of speaking</p>
<p>and a crude way of speaking,</p>
<p>you know, be that Putin,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ve seen that happen with Erdogan,</p>
<p>the president of Turkey,</p>
<p>you know, and it gets translated</p>
<p>by a much more refined, you know, female speaker.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve just lost the whole thing.</p>
<p>And, you know, many of the translators</p>
<p>on the Russian side are not competent in English</p>
<p>in the way that you would hope they are.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not, it&rsquo;s not just that they&rsquo;re not native speakers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just not trained to the same high standards</p>
<p>they used to be in the past.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And you just get, you lose the nuance,</p>
<p>you lose the feel.</p>
<p>You know, you almost need, you know,</p>
<p>kind of the interpretive actor,</p>
<p>you know, doing, you know,</p>
<p>the kind of the interpretation.</p>
<p>You need to match it as much as you can</p>
<p>in the way that you, you know, do voiceovers in film.</p>
<p>The best way to talk to Putin</p>
<p>is one-on-one in his own language.</p>
<p>I mean, I have a really great friend here</p>
<p>who is one of the best interpreters.</p>
<p>Putin is often asked by the, you know,</p>
<p>the media to interpret for him.</p>
<p>He just, he was at the institute that I was,</p>
<p>I mean, I know him from that kind of period.</p>
<p>And he is just excellent.</p>
<p>Just like Pavel Polashenko was absolutely phenomenal</p>
<p>at interpreting Gorbachev.</p>
<p>Now he didn&rsquo;t always interpret him accurately</p>
<p>because Gorbachev made lots of grammatical gaffes</p>
<p>and sometimes was, you know,</p>
<p>Gorbachev himself would joke that Polashenko,</p>
<p>you know, spoke better for Gorbachev</p>
<p>than Gorbachev could himself.</p>
<p>But Putin is actually quite precise</p>
<p>and careful in the way that he speaks</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of menace sometimes</p>
<p>to things deliberately.</p>
<p>Other times there&rsquo;s lots of humor</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s telling a joke for a particular reason.</p>
<p>And all of it is, I mean,</p>
<p>he actually uses the richness of the Russian language</p>
<p>and the crudity of language</p>
<p>that can&rsquo;t be conveyed in English.</p>
<p>But also facial expressions.</p>
<p>Yeah, facial expressions, body language,</p>
<p>the way that he sits back in the chair and slouches,</p>
<p>the kind of the way that he makes fun of people</p>
<p>and he, you know, kind of uses irony.</p>
<p>Just some of it is just lost</p>
<p>and it needs to be conveyed.</p>
<p>The depth of humor and wit,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve met quite a few like political leaders like that</p>
<p>and they speak only Russian.</p>
<p>When I was traveling in Ukraine,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you translate that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s almost,</p>
<p>the other person that reminds me like that a little bit</p>
<p>is Obama.</p>
<p>Obama had a wit and an intelligence,</p>
<p>but like he would smile as he said something</p>
<p>that add a lot to it.</p>
<p>Like that he&rsquo;s trolling you</p>
<p>or he&rsquo;s being sarcastic</p>
<p>or like me converting into words.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious that all English speakers,</p>
<p>if they listen to Obama,</p>
<p>but if you had to translate to a different language,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re going to lose a lot of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, when I watched the,</p>
<p>I mean, I watched many of Putin&rsquo;s speeches,</p>
<p>you know, kind of just in Russian,</p>
<p>not looking at any of the, you know,</p>
<p>the subtitles or anything.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just watching the way that his body language is</p>
<p>at the time when he&rsquo;s saying things,</p>
<p>the way that you smirk, he&rsquo;ll sneer,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll laugh, he&rsquo;ll ad-lib,</p>
<p>you know, kind of from something that obviously kind of,</p>
<p>you know, wasn&rsquo;t there on the prepared speech.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really critical.</p>
<p>And, you know, kind of a lot,</p>
<p>some people speak, you know, like Trump,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s kind of just words.</p>
<p>Putin, the words are very important.</p>
<p>Trump, it&rsquo;s the atmosphere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the kind of the way you feel about things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the buzz you get, you know, it&rsquo;s revving people up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the kind of slogans and Putin, it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s conveying a lot in what he&rsquo;s saying there.</p>
<p>But I think, I mean, of course I don&rsquo;t know much</p>
<p>because I only speak Russian and English,</p>
<p>but I have in English or Russian</p>
<p>have not met almost anyone ever</p>
<p>as interesting in conversation as Putin.</p>
<p>I think he shines not in speeches,</p>
<p>but in interactions with others.</p>
<p>Yeah, when you watch those interviews and things with him,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve, you know, been at many of these sessions,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been hours of him parrying questions.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like watching a boxer sparring,</p>
<p>you know, in a kind of training bout.</p>
<p>Yeah, come on, give me another one.</p>
<p>You know, and it&rsquo;s kind of like,</p>
<p>and he prides himself and he&rsquo;s made mistakes often,</p>
<p>but the breadth of, you know, the issues</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s often covered has been fascinating.</p>
<p>And I used to just take, you know,</p>
<p>kind of really detailed notes about this</p>
<p>because you learn a ton.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also about his worldview again.</p>
<p>I mean, he does live in a certain box, like we all do.</p>
<p>And, you know, again, his world experience</p>
<p>is not as extensive as, you know,</p>
<p>you would hope it would be.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s why you have to really pay attention.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;ve messed up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we haven&rsquo;t really paid a lot of attention</p>
<p>to what he&rsquo;s been saying.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been telegraphing this grievance,</p>
<p>this dissatisfaction, this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do something for years.</p>
<p>And the thing is during war time,</p>
<p>the combined with propaganda</p>
<p>and the narratives of resentment and grievance,</p>
<p>you dig in on those.</p>
<p>Like maybe you start out not believing it,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s all going to believe it eventually.</p>
<p>Well, you convince yourself over time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Look, the longer you&rsquo;re in a position like Putin,</p>
<p>22 years now, coming from 23 years,</p>
<p>could be out there for 36 years.</p>
<p>You become more and more rigid.</p>
<p>I mean, this is, again, you know,</p>
<p>something that you see in history.</p>
<p>You know, you look at, you know,</p>
<p>people through history have moved</p>
<p>from kind of being kind of left wing</p>
<p>in their perspectives to hard right.</p>
<p>They kind of have a,</p>
<p>but kind of a sort of an ossification</p>
<p>or a rigidity emerges in their views.</p>
<p>I mean, again, I used to have these arguments</p>
<p>with Professor Pius about Lenin</p>
<p>because he would talk about Lenin.</p>
<p>I said, but he didn&rsquo;t change his mind from being 18.</p>
<p>Have you not thought about that?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re not formed,</p>
<p>fully formed individuals at 18.</p>
<p>You know, we don&rsquo;t know anything.</p>
<p>We know something, but not everything.</p>
<p>I mean, and obviously the younger context,</p>
<p>you know, the kind of the way that you kind of grow up,</p>
<p>the place you grew up,</p>
<p>the things that happened to you,</p>
<p>the traumas you have.</p>
<p>I mean, all of these have an impact,</p>
<p>but then if you don&rsquo;t grow beyond all of that,</p>
<p>and Putin&rsquo;s been stuck in place since 2000</p>
<p>when he became president.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not out and about, you know,</p>
<p>kind of being a man of the people.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s not doing</p>
<p>the kind of things that he used to do.</p>
<p>Yeah, he gets out there and he goes to Kazakhstan</p>
<p>and, you know, Tajikistan,</p>
<p>and he goes to China and he does this and that.</p>
<p>And then to COVID, he didn&rsquo;t go anywhere.</p>
<p>I mean, very few places.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s got stuck.</p>
<p>And that worries me a lot,</p>
<p>because you could see before that he,</p>
<p>you know, had a bit more of flexibility of thought.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why nobody should be in place forever.</p>
<p>You should always kind of like get out there</p>
<p>and go out there and learn a new skill.</p>
<p>You know, kind of.</p>
<p>He needs some, he needs to sort of,</p>
<p>you know, he needs to get out more</p>
<p>and do something different.</p>
<p>You had an interesting point you&rsquo;ve made</p>
<p>that both Vladimir Zelensky and Putin</p>
<p>are thinking about they&rsquo;re just politicians.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re thinking about the 2024 election,</p>
<p>which is coming up for both of them.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve said that in some of the other interviews.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, I know.</p>
<p>Because their election is going to be</p>
<p>pretty much at the same time.</p>
<p>As the U.S. election also.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;ll be before.</p>
<p>I mean, because it&rsquo;s sometime in that,</p>
<p>you know, early part of the year</p>
<p>for the presidential election.</p>
<p>Yeah. And also, I don&rsquo;t know if you know</p>
<p>about U.S. elections,</p>
<p>but they actually last way longer than a year.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in it now, aren&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>You know, already.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re already starting.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s going to be a significant overlap.</p>
<p>Do you think that actually comes into play</p>
<p>in their calculus?</p>
<p>I think it was one of the reasons</p>
<p>why Putin invaded in February of 2022,</p>
<p>because it was going to be two years.</p>
<p>I mean, he thought it&rsquo;d be over by March of 2022.</p>
<p>And he got two years to prepare for,</p>
<p>you know, the election.</p>
<p>And he got a big boost, you know,</p>
<p>not only he got a boost from Crimea.</p>
<p>I mean, I didn&rsquo;t mention that before.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the reasons for invading Crimea</p>
<p>and annexing or invading Ukraine</p>
<p>the first time and annexing Crimea</p>
<p>was look what happened to his ratings.</p>
<p>They went from kind of declining.</p>
<p>And it was still pretty good,</p>
<p>you know, by anybody&rsquo;s standards</p>
<p>to just rocketing off into the stratosphere.</p>
<p>I mean, I didn&rsquo;t really meet anybody in Russia</p>
<p>who thought that annexing Crimea</p>
<p>was, you know, kind of a bad thing.</p>
<p>I mean, even, you know, kind of people</p>
<p>who were opposed Putin on so many other things.</p>
<p>Crimea was, you know,</p>
<p>Krimnash, they kept saying, you know,</p>
<p>this is kind of, you know, we got it back.</p>
<p>You know, it should never have gone away.</p>
<p>It was ours, you know.</p>
<p>But, you know, this is more complex.</p>
<p>And he wasn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t think at the time,</p>
<p>planning on annexing all of Ukraine</p>
<p>when he went in this special military operation.</p>
<p>He was going to try to turn it</p>
<p>into what Belarus has become, you know,</p>
<p>part of a, you know,</p>
<p>bring back the Commonwealth of Independent States</p>
<p>or the union, then a new union</p>
<p>with Belarus and Ukraine and Russia over time.</p>
<p>But certainly, you know,</p>
<p>remove Ukraine as a major factor,</p>
<p>independent factor on the world stage</p>
<p>and, you know, consolidate Crimea</p>
<p>and maybe, you know,</p>
<p>kind of incorporate Donetsk and Luhansk,</p>
<p>you know, kind of that was also a possibility.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t in his intention,</p>
<p>in any case, to have something</p>
<p>on this kind of scale.</p>
<p>He wanted to get on with then</p>
<p>preparing for what was going to be,</p>
<p>he would think, the cakewalk,</p>
<p>the shoe-in of the next presidential election.</p>
<p>I mean, last time around,</p>
<p>he had to invent a bit of competition</p>
<p>with this person who&rsquo;s reputed to be his goddaughter,</p>
<p>Ksenia Sobchak, you know,</p>
<p>for a bit of, you know,</p>
<p>kind of entertainment for people.</p>
<p>This next time around, you know,</p>
<p>maybe he wasn&rsquo;t really planning on running,</p>
<p>you know, against any other,</p>
<p>you know, serious opposition.</p>
<p>He was just going to have the acclaim of,</p>
<p>you know, the kind of the great leader,</p>
<p>like President Xi in China.</p>
<p>You know, Putin, you know, was basically,</p>
<p>I think, you know, he also hoped</p>
<p>that he would be able to devolve some authority away,</p>
<p>you know, kind of, so he&rsquo;s more like the,</p>
<p>you know, the supreme leader kind of figure,</p>
<p>the czar-like figure, the monarch.</p>
<p>And then, you know, other people get on</p>
<p>with the chief executive,</p>
<p>prime ministerial run of the country.</p>
<p>And he could kind of, like,</p>
<p>step back and just enjoy this.</p>
<p>You know, maybe there was going to be, again,</p>
<p>a new union of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine</p>
<p>in some, you know, fashion,</p>
<p>and he could preside over that.</p>
<p>So speaking of opposition,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve criticized the famed Putin critic,</p>
<p>Alexei Navalny.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the nature of your criticism?</p>
<p>Well, it hasn&rsquo;t really been a kind of a criticism</p>
<p>in the way that, you know, people have implied,</p>
<p>but more just reminding people</p>
<p>that Navalny isn&rsquo;t some stooge of the West,</p>
<p>as other people have, you know,</p>
<p>kind of depicted him in the Russian film,</p>
<p>but, you know, saying that this is kind of,</p>
<p>you know, he&rsquo;s pro-Western.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a Russian nationalist</p>
<p>and a Russian patriot.</p>
<p>You know, in the past, he&rsquo;s articulated,</p>
<p>you know, things are not so dissimilar</p>
<p>from some of the people around Putin.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s more just reminding people that,</p>
<p>you know, just because you kind of see somebody,</p>
<p>you know, as a kind of an opposition figure</p>
<p>or somebody who might be more palatable from,</p>
<p>you know, your perspective looking from the West,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not always going to be,</p>
<p>you know, what you think they are.</p>
<p>Alexei Navalny is a Russian.</p>
<p>And, you know, in a particular Russian context,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s different from Putin,</p>
<p>but he wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily, you know,</p>
<p>kind of run, you know, the Russian system</p>
<p>in ways that we will like.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of, it&rsquo;s not a kind of a criticism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of a critique of the way that we look at things.</p>
<p>You know, I think it&rsquo;s a mistake to always,</p>
<p>you know, say, well, this is pro-Western</p>
<p>or this is a, you know, liberal.</p>
<p>I mean, what the heck does that mean, pro-Western?</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s a Russian.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a Russian nationalist and a Russian patriot.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s often, you know, been, you know,</p>
<p>quite critical about immigration.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s had some negative views about,</p>
<p>you know, from one part of the moment</p>
<p>he said, don&rsquo;t feed the Caucasus,</p>
<p>you know, kind of played upon some of the,</p>
<p>you know, the racial and ethnic tensions</p>
<p>inside of, you know, Russia itself as well.</p>
<p>Now he is a pluralist, you know, and he&rsquo;s kind of,</p>
<p>and he wants to have, you know,</p>
<p>a different set of political actors there.</p>
<p>But he also isn&rsquo;t promoting revolution.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not Lenin.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not wanting to bring down the state.</p>
<p>He wants to kind of, you know,</p>
<p>change the people who are in charge.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s being basically focused on.</p>
<p>And, you know, he might have,</p>
<p>and have things and do things that,</p>
<p>you know, we elsewhere might not like.</p>
<p>And I guess the bigger picture there is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not trivial to know that if you place</p>
<p>another human in power to replace</p>
<p>the current human in power,</p>
<p>that things are going to be better.</p>
<p>They could be a lot worse</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a momentum to a system.</p>
<p>A system is bigger than just this leader,</p>
<p>even when that leader has a huge amount of power.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s absolutely right.</p>
<p>And, you know, he grew up in that,</p>
<p>you know, same system.</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s younger than Putin,</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s got a different generational perspective.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s not wedded to the Soviet Union</p>
<p>or, you know, kind of some concept of the Russian empire.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t seem to spend a lot of time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s doing, you know, in jail,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s probably not sitting around,</p>
<p>you know, reading Lomonosov</p>
<p>and, you know, the kind of,</p>
<p>the great kind of tracts of Russian history.</p>
<p>Could be, actually.</p>
<p>But, I mean, I think, you know,</p>
<p>Navalny has a different worldview</p>
<p>and a different perspective,</p>
<p>just like Medvedev was different,</p>
<p>you know, in his time and presidency</p>
<p>and made some, you know,</p>
<p>changes and some innovations there.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t think that they&rsquo;re going to be radically different.</p>
<p>Because, look, Gorbachev,</p>
<p>I mean, he was so different</p>
<p>from Andropov and Chinenko and others as a person,</p>
<p>but he was also constrained by the system.</p>
<p>And he wanted to have change,</p>
<p>but he wanted evolutionary change.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know how to do it,</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t want to bring the whole system down.</p>
<p>Look at Khrushchev.</p>
<p>When he came in, you know,</p>
<p>after that whole period of,</p>
<p>you know, everybody trying to figure out</p>
<p>what to do after Stalin had died</p>
<p>and there was all this kind of back and forth,</p>
<p>and eventually Khrushchev emerges.</p>
<p>And, you know, he tries to make changes to the system,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s also a creature of a very specific context.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s grown up in the same system.</p>
<p>And he, you know, kind of brings</p>
<p>all kinds of elements of chaos there,</p>
<p>you know, to the whole thing.</p>
<p>And, you know, gets into a standoff with the United States</p>
<p>that we know is the Cuban Missile Crisis.</p>
<p>And eventually, you know, gets removed.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re looking at what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in the United Kingdom right now.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve just churned through three prime ministers,</p>
<p>and actually five prime ministers in, you know,</p>
<p>kind of as many years.</p>
<p>But all of those prime ministers have come out</p>
<p>of the context of the Conservative Party.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all, you know, kind of just shades of,</p>
<p>you know, the same thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve all come out of the same academic</p>
<p>and, you know, kind of privileged backgrounds.</p>
<p>Even Rishi Sunak, the new prime minister,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the first, you know, Indian or Anglo-Indian</p>
<p>prime minister in British history.</p>
<p>It was a kind of phenomenal, you know,</p>
<p>kind of as a child of Indian immigrants,</p>
<p>but also a person of great privilege</p>
<p>from the same academic and party background as the others.</p>
<p>You know, so there are always differences</p>
<p>with those human beings, but those contexts matter a lot.</p>
<p>What is the probability that Russia attacks Ukraine</p>
<p>with a tactical nuclear weapon?</p>
<p>Well, Putin&rsquo;s definitely been thinking about it, right?</p>
<p>I mean, he is the kind of person,</p>
<p>if he&rsquo;s got an instrument,</p>
<p>he wants to figure out how to use it.</p>
<p>You know, we look at polonium.</p>
<p>We look at Novichok.</p>
<p>You know, we look at all kinds of things,</p>
<p>you know, that he&rsquo;s also presided over in Syria.</p>
<p>He has, you know, put in charge of the war in Ukraine now.</p>
<p>General Savrykin is known as General Armageddon.</p>
<p>You know, the kind of person who, you know,</p>
<p>pretty much facilitated the use of chemical weapons</p>
<p>in Syria, you know, for example.</p>
<p>So, you know, don&rsquo;t think that Putin,</p>
<p>you know, hasn&rsquo;t thought about</p>
<p>how ruthless he can possibly be.</p>
<p>The question is really the calculation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s his estimation of the probability</p>
<p>that it will get the desired effect.</p>
<p>We keep talking about this idea of escalate to deescalate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what the Russians, you know, how they call it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the whole idea that you do something</p>
<p>really outrageous to get everybody else to back off.</p>
<p>Now, when you talked about the precedent</p>
<p>that the United States set of detonating the nuclear weapons</p>
<p>in Hiroshima and Nagasaki,</p>
<p>what, you know, he obviously meant the precedent</p>
<p>of using nuclear weapons, of course,</p>
<p>which, of course, we would then say,</p>
<p>well, we showed then how the impermissibility</p>
<p>of ever doing that again.</p>
<p>But what he&rsquo;s talking about is the precedent</p>
<p>of escalating to such an extent that you stop the war,</p>
<p>because he reads that saying,</p>
<p>well, you know, the U.S. dropped the bombs</p>
<p>on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>
<p>The war was brought to a quick conclusion.</p>
<p>And of course, there&rsquo;s a huge debate in America</p>
<p>about whether it was necessary to do that,</p>
<p>whether the war was ending anyway.</p>
<p>Did that really, you know, kind of change the minds</p>
<p>of the Japanese high command?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s all kind of books</p>
<p>and being written about that.</p>
<p>And of course, you know, the revulsion that people felt</p>
<p>in the wake of that was just, you know,</p>
<p>just the shock of what actually happened.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve spent, you know, 70 years, you know,</p>
<p>basically coming to terms with the fact</p>
<p>that we did something like that.</p>
<p>You know, the firebombing, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve also looked at all the bombing, you know,</p>
<p>in Vietnam and everywhere.</p>
<p>And, you know, all these massive bombing campaigns</p>
<p>and realizing they actually often had the opposite effect.</p>
<p>Hiroshima and Nagasaki might have contributed</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of, you know,</p>
<p>scholarship suggesting it did to the end of the war.</p>
<p>But all of the big bombing campaigns</p>
<p>and the destruction actually prolonged wars</p>
<p>because they made people fight back,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re kind of seeing in the case of Ukraine.</p>
<p>So Putin has to calculate the probability</p>
<p>that if he uses some tactical nuclear weapon,</p>
<p>that it will get the desired effect,</p>
<p>which is get us to capitulate and Ukraine to capitulate.</p>
<p>Us to capitulate, meaning the United States</p>
<p>and the Europeans not supporting Ukraine anymore,</p>
<p>pushing towards a negotiating table</p>
<p>and negotiating Ukraine away.</p>
<p>And Ukraine saying, okay, we give up,</p>
<p>like happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki or in Japan.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s his calculation, you know,</p>
<p>as much as anything else, which is really important.</p>
<p>He said, we have to show him</p>
<p>that he won&rsquo;t get that out of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of less our probability</p>
<p>and, you know, kind of the odds of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just how he calculates that probability</p>
<p>of getting what he wants.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess that&rsquo;s how the game of poker works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your probability</p>
<p>and your estimate of their probability</p>
<p>and your estimate of their estimate of your probability</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it goes on, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I think he has two tools, right?</p>
<p>So one is actually the actual use of nuclear weapons</p>
<p>and then the threat of the-</p>
<p>Oh, the threat is very effective.</p>
<p>And the more real you make the threat-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like the more you approach the actual use,</p>
<p>like get very close to using it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s already using Chernobyl, Zaporizhia</p>
<p>and then using Ukraine&rsquo;s, the other nuclear reactors.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s using civilian nuclear reactors as a dirty bomb.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s ironic that he has Sergei Shoigu,</p>
<p>his defense minister, calling people up</p>
<p>and saying the Ukrainians are going to use a dirty bomb.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re already doing it.</p>
<p>I mean, what is, you know, kind of more destructive</p>
<p>than stirring up all the radioactive dust</p>
<p>in Chernobyl as you send your troops through,</p>
<p>you know, for example,</p>
<p>or shelling, you know, the Chernobyl plant</p>
<p>and the sarcophagus and putting it at risk.</p>
<p>And Zaporizhia, you&rsquo;ve got the</p>
<p>International Atomic Energy Agency</p>
<p>running out there in utter panic</p>
<p>and, you know, kind of also trying to</p>
<p>intervene in the conflict.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re putting, you know,</p>
<p>civilian nuclear reactors at risk.</p>
<p>I mean, that also has the great added effect</p>
<p>of cutting off Ukraine&rsquo;s power supply</p>
<p>because Zaporizhia in particular was,</p>
<p>what was it, a third of Ukraine&rsquo;s power generation</p>
<p>or some, you know, really high percentage.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to go back and, you know, take a look at that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a twofer.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a kind of a double effect</p>
<p>of undermining power generation,</p>
<p>also frightening Germans and others</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve already been very worried about nuclear power</p>
<p>and, you know, increasing your leverage</p>
<p>on the energy front,</p>
<p>but also scaring people</p>
<p>from the perspective of the use of nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>Those reactors also become</p>
<p>a nuclear weapon tactically deployed.</p>
<p>And as you said,</p>
<p>the discussion of using a nuclear weapon</p>
<p>and engendering all those fears,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s already got an effect.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s running around talking about</p>
<p>the Cuban Missile Crisis and secret diplomacy,</p>
<p>and how we negotiate away Ukraine</p>
<p>in return for Putin not blowing up a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s got a lot of people already talking about that.</p>
<p>So, sorry for the difficult and dark question.</p>
<p>It could be for you directly,</p>
<p>or more like,</p>
<p>do you think we have a plan for this?</p>
<p>What happens if he does drop a nuclear weapon?</p>
<p>Do you have a sense that the United States</p>
<p>has a good plan?</p>
<p>I know we&rsquo;re talking about it.</p>
<p>I think we probably have several plans</p>
<p>because it depends on what, where, when, how.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t, and also don&rsquo;t these things</p>
<p>happen very quickly?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s also signaling</p>
<p>and signs of movement there.</p>
<p>I mean, I want to be very, you know,</p>
<p>kind of careful about this.</p>
<p>But then the thing is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also very important</p>
<p>that we do this with other nuclear powers.</p>
<p>So the other thing that&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>from how it might&rsquo;ve been in the past,</p>
<p>and particularly different</p>
<p>from the Cuban Missile Crisis</p>
<p>and the Iran Missile Crisis,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not the only nuclear players.</p>
<p>China has a major nuclear arsenal now,</p>
<p>less on the strategic side,</p>
<p>but building it up,</p>
<p>but very much on the intermediate range and tactical.</p>
<p>Kim Jong-un is firing off weapons</p>
<p>left, right, and center at the moment in North Korea.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got other rogue states.</p>
<p>Putin&rsquo;s behaving like a rogue state,</p>
<p>just to be very clear here.</p>
<p>And this is what we&rsquo;ve got with Kim Jong-un in North Korea.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also got India and Pakistan,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve got other states</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not supposed to talk about</p>
<p>that we know have nuclear capacities,</p>
<p>and others that would like to have nuclear capacity.</p>
<p>And the whole question here</p>
<p>is about also proliferation.</p>
<p>Getting back to that time</p>
<p>when Ukraine had nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>at least there on its territory</p>
<p>instead of Belarus and Kazakhstan,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to wonder,</p>
<p>was it wise for them to give it up?</p>
<p>We were worried about, you know,</p>
<p>kind of loose nukes,</p>
<p>nuclear weapons, you know,</p>
<p>kind of getting out of hand.</p>
<p>Proliferation at the time,</p>
<p>we wanted fewer nuclear powers.</p>
<p>Russia wanted that too.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re going to have more.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got more.</p>
<p>And what Putin is saying is,</p>
<p>well, that was stupid of Ukraine</p>
<p>to give up the nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>In fact, my colleagues and I,</p>
<p>back in our report and back in the USSR,</p>
<p>kind of suggest they shouldn&rsquo;t give them up.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we had the Budapest memorandum.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the United States,</p>
<p>the United Kingdom in particular,</p>
<p>have, you know,</p>
<p>basically some responsibility and obligation</p>
<p>going back to 1994,</p>
<p>when they promised Ukraine</p>
<p>that gave up the nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>their territorial integrity and sovereignty</p>
<p>would remain intact.</p>
<p>Some obligation to actually do something,</p>
<p>to step up.</p>
<p>If we step back from that,</p>
<p>this is the thing that people</p>
<p>are not talking about.</p>
<p>You know, what about nuclear proliferation?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re South Korea, Japan,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re any other country</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of worrying about your neighbours.</p>
<p>And, you know, what might happen to you?</p>
<p>Just like India and Pakistan are both like,</p>
<p>well, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got to kind of keep our</p>
<p>strategic nuclear violence here.</p>
<p>Everything is up for question.</p>
<p>Saudis will want a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>The Turks already want one.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve talked about one for years.</p>
<p>You know, why should the Iranians</p>
<p>be the only one with an Islamic</p>
<p>nuclear weapon?</p>
<p>You know, and if we know that,</p>
<p>you know, Iran has</p>
<p>breakout capacity now,</p>
<p>the Saudis and all the other,</p>
<p>you know, states that</p>
<p>are in opposition to Iran</p>
<p>will also want to have</p>
<p>some nuclear capacity.</p>
<p>And the United States before</p>
<p>wanted to maintain everything</p>
<p>under the nuclear umbrella.</p>
<p>You know, one of the reasons</p>
<p>why Sweden and Finland</p>
<p>are joining NATO</p>
<p>is because of suddenly</p>
<p>all of these nuclear threats.</p>
<p>Sweden was actually the last country</p>
<p>on the planet</p>
<p>to want to have nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>They were actually pushing for a ban</p>
<p>on nuclear weapons in the United Nations.</p>
<p>Now that Putin&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>the nuclear saber rattling,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re talking about joining</p>
<p>and are on the verge of joining</p>
<p>a nuclear alliance.</p>
<p>You know, see what&rsquo;s happening here.</p>
<p>So we have to make it</p>
<p>more and more difficult for Putin</p>
<p>to even contemplate that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why people are saying</p>
<p>this is reckless,</p>
<p>this is irresponsible.</p>
<p>Putin is actually making the world</p>
<p>less safe for himself</p>
<p>down the line either.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s thinking short term here.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s thinking, what can I do?</p>
<p>What do I actually have?</p>
<p>You can also destroy</p>
<p>lots of infrastructure,</p>
<p>as he&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>You can use subversion.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re worried about</p>
<p>all of the undersea cables,</p>
<p>all these weird things happening,</p>
<p>you know, off Orkney</p>
<p>or in the Mediterranean</p>
<p>or, you know,</p>
<p>all these other things</p>
<p>that are happening,</p>
<p>Nord Stream 2, pipelines,</p>
<p>other infrastructure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of other things</p>
<p>that he can do as well here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just, you know,</p>
<p>again, this is a civilian nuclear threat</p>
<p>of blowing up, you know,</p>
<p>one of the reactors.</p>
<p>Now, he&rsquo;s got to be sure about</p>
<p>where the wind turns</p>
<p>and the wind blows.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all kinds of things</p>
<p>to, you know, factor in here.</p>
<p>But Putin is definitely</p>
<p>sitting around</p>
<p>calculating with other people,</p>
<p>what can I do to turn this around?</p>
<p>I mean, he still thinks</p>
<p>that he can win this.</p>
<p>Or, in other words,</p>
<p>he can end it on his terms.</p>
<p>Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk,</p>
<p>Kherson, Zaporizhia.</p>
<p>And, you know, capitulation</p>
<p>or recognized as being part of Russia.</p>
<p>Or he can freeze it</p>
<p>and then, you know,</p>
<p>kind of figure out</p>
<p>where it goes from there.</p>
<p>What other pressure he can put on.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s confident</p>
<p>he can get rid of Zelensky.</p>
<p>And he can prevail over us.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I mean,</p>
<p>the UK is going through</p>
<p>prime ministers, you know,</p>
<p>faster than I&rsquo;m changing my socks,</p>
<p>you know, so it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you know, he can, you know,</p>
<p>prevail on the, you know,</p>
<p>basically he can have an impact</p>
<p>on the political scene</p>
<p>in Europe and elsewhere.</p>
<p>I mean, again, everyone&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>about winter coming.</p>
<p>And Putin&rsquo;s thinking, yeah, great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve, you know, destroyed</p>
<p>the infrastructure of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Are you worried about the winter?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, but I mean, look,</p>
<p>the other thing is that</p>
<p>we have to start preparing.</p>
<p>I mean, we have to start</p>
<p>thinking about this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a wartime economy situation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we are.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got the home front</p>
<p>to think about as well.</p>
<p>Putin has declared war on us.</p>
<p>He did that on September 30th.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s done it</p>
<p>at other points as well.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve just not paid attention.</p>
<p>But he was pretty explicit</p>
<p>on September 30th.</p>
<p>I mean, go back and watch that speech.</p>
<p>And, you know, he is gambling</p>
<p>that, you know, people will go back,</p>
<p>you know, to basically</p>
<p>taking Russian gas and oil.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not going to be</p>
<p>that simple as well.</p>
<p>And do people,</p>
<p>and then, you know,</p>
<p>the question has to be,</p>
<p>do we really kind of think</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going to play fair after that</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s kind of also</p>
<p>shown that he can leverage that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a complicated world.</p>
<p>It is complicated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very complicated.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s never, I mean,</p>
<p>it feels like things are heating up.</p>
<p>Like, and China</p>
<p>is very quiet right now.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re watching what happens.</p>
<p>I mean, for President Xi,</p>
<p>you know, he&rsquo;s trying to consolidate</p>
<p>his power even further</p>
<p>after the party Congress.</p>
<p>But he doesn&rsquo;t want to look like</p>
<p>he made a mistake by backing Putin.</p>
<p>I mean, he thought Putin</p>
<p>was also going to be, you know,</p>
<p>Ukraine would probably be open</p>
<p>for massive Chinese investment.</p>
<p>China was the largest investor</p>
<p>in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Before the war.</p>
<p>Largest single investor.</p>
<p>I mean, the EU was bigger, of course.</p>
<p>How do you hope the war ends in Ukraine?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I do hope it ends,</p>
<p>you know, with a ceasefire</p>
<p>and a negotiated solution.</p>
<p>But it has to be with Russia</p>
<p>compromising on something.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not where we are right now.</p>
<p>Do you think both sides</p>
<p>might be willing to compromise?</p>
<p>Most wars always end in that way.</p>
<p>I mean, nobody&rsquo;s ever happy.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t seem to,</p>
<p>either side legitimately</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want to compromise right now.</p>
<p>Yeah, because I mean, look,</p>
<p>the thing is that for Ukraine right now,</p>
<p>anything is a compromise</p>
<p>at its expense, right?</p>
<p>Vast devastation,</p>
<p>unbelievable casualty rates,</p>
<p>biggest refugee crisis since World War II.</p>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s just said,</p>
<p>sorry, this is our territory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just Crimea.</p>
<p>I think there could have been</p>
<p>a negotiation over that.</p>
<p>But, you know, Donetsk and Luhansk.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve got all kinds of formulas</p>
<p>all the way through history</p>
<p>of, you know, putting things</p>
<p>under a kind of guardianship,</p>
<p>receivership of territory,</p>
<p>the United Nations,</p>
<p>all kinds of different ways</p>
<p>of formulating that.</p>
<p>We could have easily been creative.</p>
<p>But Russia&rsquo;s basically saying,</p>
<p>nope, sorry, we&rsquo;ve taken this.</p>
<p>And any other negotiations,</p>
<p>just you recognizing this</p>
<p>for us not doing more destruction.</p>
<p>I mean, that is not the basis</p>
<p>for a negotiation.</p>
<p>And, you know, having, you know,</p>
<p>kind of people come</p>
<p>and just sort of laying those terms down</p>
<p>is not a starting position.</p>
<p>I think Russia</p>
<p>is also, you know,</p>
<p>in a dilemma of its own making now</p>
<p>because Putin has made it very difficult,</p>
<p>you know, to compromise</p>
<p>just by everything that he said.</p>
<p>Now, for Ukraine,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve already won</p>
<p>a great moral, political,</p>
<p>and military victory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just hard to see it, right,</p>
<p>at the particular moment.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve done what the Finns did</p>
<p>in the Winter War,</p>
<p>which the Finns were devastated</p>
<p>by the Winter War as well,</p>
<p>but they pushed them back.</p>
<p>Now, the Finns lost a lot of territory.</p>
<p>They lost Karelia</p>
<p>and, you know, huge swathes of territory,</p>
<p>but they got to be Finland.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>joining NATO,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve been part of the EU.</p>
<p>The question is how to,</p>
<p>you know, get Ukraine to be</p>
<p>Ukraine in a success.</p>
<p>But, you know, is,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the challenge.</p>
<p>Now, again, they&rsquo;ve already won</p>
<p>psychologically, politically, militarily</p>
<p>because Putin hasn&rsquo;t succeeded</p>
<p>in what he wanted to do,</p>
<p>but he has succeeded</p>
<p>in completely and utterly devastating them.</p>
<p>And this is the kind of the old Muscovite,</p>
<p>the old Russian imperial,</p>
<p>old Soviet mentality,</p>
<p>you know, going all the way back</p>
<p>to when the Muscovites</p>
<p>were the bag men for the,</p>
<p>you know, the horde for the Mongols.</p>
<p>It was destruction.</p>
<p>You know, you don&rsquo;t play with us,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll destroy you.</p>
<p>You know, people talk about it as mafia,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s older, you know.</p>
<p>All you have to go down</p>
<p>is to go and see Tarkovsky&rsquo;s Andrei Rublyov.</p>
<p>I mean, I remember, you know,</p>
<p>seeing that film when I was first</p>
<p>as a student in Moscow</p>
<p>and just being,</p>
<p>whoa, this is so brutal.</p>
<p>I mean, this is just unremittingly brutal</p>
<p>because the whole point is</p>
<p>that you show people who&rsquo;s the boss.</p>
<p>The destruction is the point of things as well</p>
<p>because, you know,</p>
<p>you are emphasizing your domination.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what Putin is doing right now,</p>
<p>is saying,</p>
<p>OK, you want to go</p>
<p>in a different direction, so be it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to make you suffer.</p>
<p>Remember when Khodorkovsky</p>
<p>got out of the penal colony</p>
<p>when Putin let him out eventually?</p>
<p>He said he suffered enough.</p>
<p>But he suffered for 10, 11 years.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Putin feels that Ukraine</p>
<p>has suffered enough at this point,</p>
<p>or we have suffered enough.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a part of this invasion</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s punishment for something.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s medieval.</p>
<p>I mean, look, we&rsquo;re all capable</p>
<p>of the same things, right?</p>
<p>There was all that destruction</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what Assad was like</p>
<p>in Syria, like his father.</p>
<p>You destroy because you teach him a lesson.</p>
<p>And look, Britain did that</p>
<p>in the colonial era.</p>
<p>I mean, all the history</p>
<p>of British colonialism</p>
<p>is exactly the same.</p>
<p>I mean, all the Mao Mao,</p>
<p>you know, and Kenya,</p>
<p>you know, up until recent times,</p>
<p>brutality, teaching people,</p>
<p>you know, teaching them a lesson.</p>
<p>You have to suffer.</p>
<p>The US did it.</p>
<p>I mean, we did it with the Native Americans.</p>
<p>You know, we did it all over the place,</p>
<p>you know, as well.</p>
<p>This is kind of what big,</p>
<p>you know, states do</p>
<p>at different points in history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that, you know,</p>
<p>Russia has not moved on from that.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve learned some lessons later.</p>
<p>I hope, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve fully internalized them</p>
<p>of, you know, things that we&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>you know, kind of the past</p>
<p>of the United States.</p>
<p>Ideally, you&rsquo;re trying to do better</p>
<p>and most of Europe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>trying to do better as well.</p>
<p>Think about France and Algeria.</p>
<p>You know, again, you know,</p>
<p>we can see this</p>
<p>in many different settings.</p>
<p>But I think, you know,</p>
<p>for Putin right now,</p>
<p>he hasn&rsquo;t taught all of us</p>
<p>sufficient a lesson.</p>
<p>I just, I talked to hundreds</p>
<p>of people in Ukraine</p>
<p>and the tough thing,</p>
<p>the inspiring thing</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a unity.</p>
<p>The tough thing is</p>
<p>a lot of them speak intensely of hate</p>
<p>towards not just Russia,</p>
<p>but Russians.</p>
<p>Russians.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how Europeans felt</p>
<p>about Germany and Germans</p>
<p>at the end of World War II.</p>
<p>And generational hate.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t think that hate</p>
<p>is gonna pass.</p>
<p>Well, it might.</p>
<p>It might well take a generation.</p>
<p>I mean, when I was a kid in the 70s,</p>
<p>I went on exchanges to Germany.</p>
<p>And that was like, you know, 30 years,</p>
<p>more than 30 years</p>
<p>after the end of the war.</p>
<p>My grandfather,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;d fought in World War I,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t speak to my parents</p>
<p>when they sent me on a&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, he hadn&rsquo;t fought in World War II,</p>
<p>he fought in World War I.</p>
<p>He hated the Germans.</p>
<p>And he did not want me going,</p>
<p>you know, to Germany as an exchange student.</p>
<p>He refused to meet,</p>
<p>you know, kind of the German kid</p>
<p>who, you know,</p>
<p>came to stay at my house.</p>
<p>You know, for example.</p>
<p>I mean, it takes a long time to,</p>
<p>you know, it takes a long time</p>
<p>to get over that.</p>
<p>But you do.</p>
<p>I mean, and we have.</p>
<p>We have in Europe.</p>
<p>And that was the whole point</p>
<p>of, you know, all of that</p>
<p>kind of exercise of European unity</p>
<p>after World War II.</p>
<p>Now, the big challenge is,</p>
<p>what do we do with Russia?</p>
<p>Because a lot of people are talking</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t have European security</p>
<p>without Russia.</p>
<p>Other people are saying</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t have a Europe,</p>
<p>you know, kind of with Russia.</p>
<p>You know, so how do we deal with this?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to basically kind of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be like Japan</p>
<p>and Germany after World War II,</p>
<p>after this.</p>
<p>Just the level of the atrocities</p>
<p>that have been carried out,</p>
<p>as you said, the level of hatred.</p>
<p>But we found a way of doing it.</p>
<p>Now, a lot of it will require</p>
<p>change on the part of Russia as well</p>
<p>and Russians</p>
<p>and really thinking about this.</p>
<p>I mean, Gorbachev before tried to do</p>
<p>in the late 1980s</p>
<p>with the black spots in,</p>
<p>with glasnost,</p>
<p>with openness</p>
<p>and talking about Russian history,</p>
<p>just kind of never</p>
<p>sort of withered on the vine</p>
<p>as time went on.</p>
<p>What gives you hope about the future?</p>
<p>Well, my hope comes into the fact</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve done things before,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve got ourselves out of tough times</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve overcome stuff</p>
<p>and in people,</p>
<p>because I meet amazing people.</p>
<p>You just talked about hundreds of people</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve met within Ukraine</p>
<p>and, you know,</p>
<p>people all think differently.</p>
<p>Contexts and circumstances change</p>
<p>and people can evolve.</p>
<p>Some people get stuck.</p>
<p>Putin&rsquo;s got stuck,</p>
<p>but people can evolve.</p>
<p>And, you know, I do think that</p>
<p>if we all pull together</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve seen this in so many contexts,</p>
<p>we can find solutions to things,</p>
<p>just like we get back again</p>
<p>to our discussion about scientists</p>
<p>and just the kind of amazing breakthroughs of,</p>
<p>you know, what we did on COVID</p>
<p>or done on, you know,</p>
<p>kind of other diseases and things.</p>
<p>And look, there is some similarities.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a pathology around war and conflict.</p>
<p>Years ago in the 1990s,</p>
<p>I worked on, you know,</p>
<p>a lot of projects</p>
<p>that were funded by the Carnegie Corporation</p>
<p>of the United States</p>
<p>under the then presidency of David Hamburg,</p>
<p>who was a scientist.</p>
<p>And I actually did see a lot of parallels</p>
<p>between the sort of like the pathology of disease</p>
<p>and, you know,</p>
<p>kind of the pestilence,</p>
<p>you know, of conflict kind of idea.</p>
<p>And of course, these, you know, parallels</p>
<p>have to be very careful</p>
<p>because, you know, they&rsquo;re not neat.</p>
<p>But there was kind of like an idea in there.</p>
<p>And how do you sort of treat this?</p>
<p>How do you deal with this?</p>
<p>And we did come up with all kinds of ideas</p>
<p>and, you know, things that are still out there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve created institutions</p>
<p>that have helped to keep the peace.</p>
<p>We just have neglected them,</p>
<p>allowed them to degrade,</p>
<p>just like the United Nations.</p>
<p>And, you know, we&rsquo;ve created problems inside them,</p>
<p>like the veto power of the permanent powers</p>
<p>on the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>But we can change that.</p>
<p>You just got to have a will.</p>
<p>And I do think out there,</p>
<p>there are sufficient people with a will.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve just got to get people mobilized.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m always amazed</p>
<p>by how people can mobilize themselves around a crisis.</p>
<p>Remember Winston Churchill,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t quote all the time</p>
<p>because I can never remember half his quotes.</p>
<p>But I do remember the one about</p>
<p>never let a good crisis go to waste.</p>
<p>And I always think that, you know,</p>
<p>yeah, we shouldn&rsquo;t let this crisis go to waste.</p>
<p>And something else can come out of this,</p>
<p>just like in Ukraine.</p>
<p>We worried before about corruption in Ukraine,</p>
<p>the influence of the oligarchs.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got our own oligarchs here in the US</p>
<p>we need to, you know, deal with as well.</p>
<p>But this is a chance to do it differently.</p>
<p>Yeah, it really is a chance to do things differently.</p>
<p>And a part of that is young people.</p>
<p>I have to ask you-</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s young people.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m feeling a bit on the older side now,</p>
<p>but I still feel I&rsquo;ve got, you know,</p>
<p>a bit of, you know, kind of youth within me yet.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re 57.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that old, but I&rsquo;m not that young.</p>
<p>But we have to work together</p>
<p>with younger and older people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to work together in coalitions of,</p>
<p>you know, across generations.</p>
<p>You remind me of kids</p>
<p>who just graduated college and say,</p>
<p>and I feel old.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, no.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually feel old,</p>
<p>but it is a number, age.</p>
<p>And, you know, when, you know,</p>
<p>you kind of think about when I was-</p>
<p>I thought you don&rsquo;t like math.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like things like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I find it interesting.</p>
<p>But, you know, when I was,</p>
<p>I remember when I was a little kid,</p>
<p>I kept thinking about the year 2000.</p>
<p>And I thought, oh my God, I&rsquo;ll be dead.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be 35.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 22 years ago.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve overcome a lot of struggle in your life</p>
<p>based on different reasons,</p>
<p>as you write about class being one of them,</p>
<p>your funny sounding accent being another,</p>
<p>or just representation of class.</p>
<p>But in general, through all of that,</p>
<p>to be at the White House,</p>
<p>to be one of the most powerful voices in the world,</p>
<p>what advice would you give</p>
<p>from grounded in your life story</p>
<p>to somebody who&rsquo;s young,</p>
<p>somebody who&rsquo;s in high school and college,</p>
<p>thinking of how they can have</p>
<p>a big positive impact on the world?</p>
<p>Look, we all have a voice, right?</p>
<p>We all have agency.</p>
<p>We all actually have the ability to do something.</p>
<p>And you can, you know,</p>
<p>start small in your local community,</p>
<p>or, you know, even in your own classroom,</p>
<p>just helping, you know, somebody else out</p>
<p>or speaking up and advocating on behalf of things.</p>
<p>You know, when I was about 11 years old,</p>
<p>I got involved with other kids on Save the Whales.</p>
<p>You know, we had all this, you know,</p>
<p>we were hardly Greta Thunberg,</p>
<p>but we, you know, we kind of got together</p>
<p>in a kind of network writing to people</p>
<p>and, you know, trying to raise money</p>
<p>to, you know, help save the whales.</p>
<p>Now, actually the whales of the world</p>
<p>are doing somewhat better.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say that that was because of me and my network,</p>
<p>but, you know, it was kind of a way of organizing</p>
<p>and, you know, kind of joining in a larger movement.</p>
<p>Everybody can be part of something bigger.</p>
<p>The thing is, it&rsquo;s all about working together with others</p>
<p>and giving other people a chance as well.</p>
<p>I think, you know, one thing is that our voices</p>
<p>have more impact when they&rsquo;re amplified.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to be the voices of discord</p>
<p>or the voices of hate.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;ve been, you know,</p>
<p>trying to do this with your podcast,</p>
<p>you know, kind of give people a voice,</p>
<p>give them a kind of platform</p>
<p>and, you know, get them to join in with other people.</p>
<p>And, you know, one of the things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been trying to do is, you know,</p>
<p>kind of go and talk to just as many people</p>
<p>as I possibly can and say,</p>
<p>look, you know, we can all do something here.</p>
<p>We can all, you know,</p>
<p>lend our voices to a cause that we care deeply about.</p>
<p>We can be kind to each other.</p>
<p>We can give other people a chance.</p>
<p>We can kind of speak out</p>
<p>when we see that, you know, something is wrong.</p>
<p>And we can try to, you know, explain things to people.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m trying to do at the moment</p>
<p>is just sort of explain, you know,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;ve learned about things</p>
<p>and, you know, hope that that helps people</p>
<p>make informed judgments of their own</p>
<p>and that, you know, kind of maybe take things further</p>
<p>and learn something more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like kind of building up on, you know,</p>
<p>the knowledge, you know, that I have, you know,</p>
<p>to try to impart to others.</p>
<p>And everybody can do that different ways.</p>
<p>You can kind of reach back.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you&rsquo;re 14, help somebody who&rsquo;s seven.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re 21, help somebody who&rsquo;s 14.</p>
<p>You know, kind of if, you know, the kind of my age now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always trying to, you know, reach back</p>
<p>and, you know, work with younger people,</p>
<p>listen to younger people,</p>
<p>help them out, make connections for them,</p>
<p>listen to what they have to say about something,</p>
<p>try to incorporate that in, you know,</p>
<p>things that I&rsquo;m saying as well.</p>
<p>The main point is that we&rsquo;ve all got a voice.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all got agency.</p>
<p>And it always works better</p>
<p>when we work together with other people.</p>
<p>But sometimes it can feel pretty hopeless.</p>
<p>It can feel, I mean, there&rsquo;s low points.</p>
<p>You seem to have a kind of restless energy,</p>
<p>a drive to you where there are low points</p>
<p>in the beginning when,</p>
<p>in your early days,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trying to get the education,</p>
<p>where it may have not been clear to you</p>
<p>that you could be at all successful.</p>
<p>MS. BEHRENS Yeah, there always were.</p>
<p>I mean, there were lots of points</p>
<p>where I was just despondent.</p>
<p>But then, you know, I&rsquo;d meet somebody</p>
<p>who would just suddenly turn things around.</p>
<p>Now, was this luck or was I out there looking for it?</p>
<p>You know, sometimes, you know, you just,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re open and receptive to, you know,</p>
<p>kind of hearing something from someone else.</p>
<p>I mean, I, you know, there were often times</p>
<p>where I felt so despondent, you know,</p>
<p>in such a black mood,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be able to go on.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;d have a chance conversation with somebody.</p>
<p>I mean, I once remember, you know,</p>
<p>I was sitting on a bench.</p>
<p>I was probably 11 or 12,</p>
<p>just crying my eyes out, just really upset.</p>
<p>And an old lady just came and sat next to me,</p>
<p>put her arm around me, said,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s all right, pet.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the matter?</p>
<p>You know, it can&rsquo;t be that bad, can it?</p>
<p>And it was just this human embrace.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like somebody, you know,</p>
<p>just basically reaching out to me</p>
<p>that snapped me out of it.</p>
<p>And I thought, you know, here&rsquo;s somebody just,</p>
<p>you know, she didn&rsquo;t know who I was.</p>
<p>She just felt really bad that I was,</p>
<p>you know, sitting, you know, crying.</p>
<p>And I mean, I can&rsquo;t even remember</p>
<p>what it was about anymore.</p>
<p>You know, now it just seems inconsequential.</p>
<p>At the time, I probably thought</p>
<p>my life was at an end.</p>
<p>Just, you know, sometimes people</p>
<p>making eye contact with you in the street</p>
<p>and saying something to you</p>
<p>can kind of pull you out of something.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s kind of a,</p>
<p>I think you would just have to</p>
<p>open yourself up to the prospect</p>
<p>that not everyone&rsquo;s bad,</p>
<p>just like you were saying before,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s, you know, good in everybody.</p>
<p>Even during, you know,</p>
<p>that really difficult period of impeachment,</p>
<p>you know, I was trying to listen</p>
<p>very carefully to people.</p>
<p>And I thought, look, we always,</p>
<p>we still have something in common here.</p>
<p>We need to remember that.</p>
<p>You know, kind of when people</p>
<p>are kind of forgetting who they are,</p>
<p>or, you know, the context in their operating,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always something that can,</p>
<p>you know, can pull you back again.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always that kind of thread.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sure you were probably attacked</p>
<p>by a lot of people,</p>
<p>and you were still able to keep that optimism?</p>
<p>Well, I kept it into kind of perspective.</p>
<p>Like when I was a kid, I mean,</p>
<p>things I mentioned before,</p>
<p>I got bullied, you know, kind of.</p>
<p>Again, and I tried to understand</p>
<p>why they&rsquo;re doing this.</p>
<p>One of the most amazing things</p>
<p>that happened, you know, early on</p>
<p>was my dad was a pretty incredible person,</p>
<p>and he would always open my eyes to something.</p>
<p>I was getting bullied really nastily</p>
<p>by a girl at school.</p>
<p>And my dad started asking me questions about her.</p>
<p>And one day my dad said</p>
<p>we were going to go for a walk.</p>
<p>And my town&rsquo;s very small.</p>
<p>Remember, it&rsquo;s very depressed,</p>
<p>really, you know, deprived area.</p>
<p>And we go to this housing estate,</p>
<p>public housing place</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not too far away from where I live.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really, you know,</p>
<p>kind of one of the most run-down places,</p>
<p>an already run-down place.</p>
<p>My dad, like, knocks on the door,</p>
<p>and I said, what are we doing, Dad?</p>
<p>And he says, well, we&rsquo;re going off to,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re going to visit somebody,</p>
<p>an old family friend.</p>
<p>I think they were even, you know,</p>
<p>a distant relative.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re knocking on the door,</p>
<p>and this old man answers the door,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s, oh, Alfie.</p>
<p>My dad&rsquo;s name was Alf, Alfie.</p>
<p>You know, kind of, oh, fancy seeing you here.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen you.</p>
<p>Come on in, have a cup of tea.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>He said, oh, I&rsquo;m just walking past with my daughter.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going for a trip.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re going for a walk.</p>
<p>And then suddenly I see that girl,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s in the kitchen,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m thinking, oh, my God,</p>
<p>bloody hell, you know, British expression.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s this?</p>
<p>And it turns out that Dad had figured out</p>
<p>who she was,</p>
<p>and he knew her grandfather,</p>
<p>and she was living with her grandfather,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;d been abandoned by her parents,</p>
<p>and she was living in, you know,</p>
<p>pretty dire circumstances,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;d been getting raised by her grandfather,</p>
<p>and she was just miserable.</p>
<p>And the reason she was bullying me</p>
<p>was to make herself feel better.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And after that, she never bullied me again.</p>
<p>I mean, we didn&rsquo;t even talk.</p>
<p>Because there was a connection made,</p>
<p>and suddenly she realized</p>
<p>that her grandfather,</p>
<p>who was the only person she had,</p>
<p>knew my dad,</p>
<p>and they were friends,</p>
<p>or they were even family.</p>
<p>Some, you know, kind of relationship there.</p>
<p>I mean, I was raised half north of England.</p>
<p>I had no idea how we were related.</p>
<p>You know, everybody was some relative.</p>
<p>Because people have lived there for generations</p>
<p>to get in this very small area,</p>
<p>and that turned things around.</p>
<p>So just remember, you might have,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s kind of suddenly taught to me,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always a reason</p>
<p>why somebody&rsquo;s doing something.</p>
<p>A lot of the times,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really unhappy with themselves.</p>
<p>Sometimes there&rsquo;s something else</p>
<p>going on in their lives.</p>
<p>Sometimes they just don&rsquo;t know any better.</p>
<p>And I shouldn&rsquo;t take it personally,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t have a personal connection</p>
<p>with half these people who are out there</p>
<p>saying that they want this and that to happen to me.</p>
<p>Well, thank you for the kindness and empathy</p>
<p>you still carry in your heart.</p>
<p>I can see it through all that you must have gone through</p>
<p>in the recent couple of years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really inspiring to see that.</p>
<p>And thank you for everything you&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>for the work you&rsquo;ve written,</p>
<p>and for the work you continue to write and to do.</p>
<p>This seems like a really, really difficult time</p>
<p>for human civilization</p>
<p>on a topic that you&rsquo;re a world expert in.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t mess it up.</p>
<p>No, I know, but that&rsquo;s what I said to everybody out there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just keep it together, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just keep it together.</p>
<p>Your words have a lot of power right now.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a really, really tricky time.</p>
<p>So thank you so much,</p>
<p>given how valuable your time is</p>
<p>to sit down with me today.</p>
<p>It was an honor.</p>
<p>No, thanks, thanks.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a privilege and a pleasure</p>
<p>to talk to you as well.</p>
<p>No, thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Fiona Hill.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from John Steinbeck.</p>
<p>Power does not corrupt, fear corrupts.</p>
<p>Perhaps the fear of the loss of power.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>
<p>I hope to see you next time.</p>
