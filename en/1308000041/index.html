    <p>This week we&rsquo;re going to play our favorite new game show.</p>
<p>Guess who&rsquo;s got COVID?</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Somebody on the pod.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey, somebody&rsquo;s got COVID.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey, it&rsquo;s not the me.</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re ruining the game, Jamal.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the game.</p>
<p>Person who got COVID.</p>
<p>Have they been vaccinated or not?</p>
<p>Okay, all four of us have been vaccinated.</p>
<p>We covered that on our previous pod.</p>
<p>So everybody&rsquo;s been vaccinated.</p>
<p>Double vax.</p>
<p>Double vax.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s been double vaxed.</p>
<p>Did we all get Pfizer?</p>
<p>I was Pfizer.</p>
<p>Pfizer.</p>
<p>Pfizer.</p>
<p>Pfizer.</p>
<p>Okay, so Pfizer across the board.</p>
<p>We got quads.</p>
<p>And this is a breakthrough infection.</p>
<p>Has anybody taken a Z-Pak after a night of partying?</p>
<p>I have.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>A hunk of the pod lasted 39 episodes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>That was good, that was good.</p>
<p>Okay, so number one.</p>
<p>Clue number one.</p>
<p>This bestie got a breakthrough infection outdoors</p>
<p>at a restaurant.</p>
<p>Number one, got it outdoors.</p>
<p>Number two, got it from somebody who was also vaccinated.</p>
<p>Number three, this bestie does not fly commercial.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s not a fan of being interrupted.</p>
<p>And he is not an evangelical.</p>
<p>David Sachs.</p>
<p>The breakthrough vaccination is David Sachs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that my getting a breakthrough case of COVID</p>
<p>is comedy fodder for you somehow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Sachs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>And it said.</p>
<p>We open sourced it to the fans</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>Nice queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Saxy Poop, break it down.</p>
<p>Walk us through what happened and then how you felt.</p>
<p>So what happened is.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re glad you&rsquo;re safe, obviously, obviously.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t be joking.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still losing weight.</p>
<p>You lost five pounds, so.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, we hate you for this.</p>
<p>You may want to read some of the beautiful text messages</p>
<p>we sent you when we found out this week.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, Jason, what did you say, Jason?</p>
<p>You said.</p>
<p>I was just like, wow,</p>
<p>think about who we could recruit for the fourth spot.</p>
<p>We get Keith Raboy, we get Peter Thiel in here.</p>
<p>I said that I really, really hope you didn&rsquo;t die.</p>
<p>But if you did,</p>
<p>I would love to have your plane as a support plane</p>
<p>for my plane.</p>
<p>And I was thinking, you know what?</p>
<p>I might be pro San Francisco.</p>
<p>If you die, I might want to.</p>
<p>Well, sorry guys, I&rsquo;m going to live.</p>
<p>Sorry, Jason, I&rsquo;m going to live.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s basically what happened, okay,</p>
<p>is so Tuesday of last week,</p>
<p>I had dinner with a few friends and then my friend.</p>
<p>Just where, outdoors in a restaurant.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll tell you exactly where we were.</p>
<p>We were at Matsuhisa in LA.</p>
<p>Which had this.</p>
<p>Oh, in the outdoor parking lot.</p>
<p>Yes, the outdoor parking lot area,</p>
<p>which is a covered outdoor area.</p>
<p>So, you know, these like covered areas</p>
<p>are effectively inside because it traps the air in there.</p>
<p>But in any event, we had dinner there.</p>
<p>The next day he woke up with a fever and sore throat.</p>
<p>He went and got a COVID test.</p>
<p>He tested positive.</p>
<p>He is also double vaxxed with Pfizer, okay?</p>
<p>So, and I reported this to you guys</p>
<p>last week on last week&rsquo;s show.</p>
<p>So I went out right away on Wednesday,</p>
<p>got a COVID test, was negative.</p>
<p>I repeated the test on Friday, was negative.</p>
<p>And then Sunday rolls around and I wake up</p>
<p>and I got a fever.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really have a sore throat,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve got kind of a, I&rsquo;d say an occasional dry cough.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve got some sinus congestion.</p>
<p>David, mild fever or like 99.9 or like 102.1?</p>
<p>It topped off at about 99.9.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s barely a fever, yeah.</p>
<p>Barely a fever.</p>
<p>Barely a fever, but I mean, it was definitely there.</p>
<p>And I took Tylenol and it brought it down</p>
<p>to the low 99s.</p>
<p>And so in any event, first thing Monday morning,</p>
<p>I went and got the COVID test and sure enough, I had COVID.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t confirm that it&rsquo;s Delta variant,</p>
<p>but they think it is because that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s like exploding</p>
<p>in LA right now.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, I mean, look, I mean,</p>
<p>the good news is it&rsquo;s very mild.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s now Thursday and I feel like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like 99% recovered.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a fever anymore.</p>
<p>My fever-</p>
<p>So this is, are you 10 days in now, this infection?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I came down with symptoms on this past Sunday</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s now Thursday.</p>
<p>So I am-</p>
<p>And when were you exposed?</p>
<p>Tuesday night.</p>
<p>So I was exposed.</p>
<p>Yes, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about 10 days from initial exposure.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re convinced that was the only way</p>
<p>you could have gotten it, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, because somebody else at the dinner</p>
<p>has symptoms now too.</p>
<p>Ah, so it was a super spreader at Matsuhisa.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, basically.</p>
<p>But it shows you how virulent this new Delta variant is.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve got, there were four people out that night</p>
<p>plus the person who had it</p>
<p>and two out of the four basically got it.</p>
<p>And we were all vaccinated,</p>
<p>including the person who had it.</p>
<p>And of course he didn&rsquo;t know he had it.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have any symptoms till the next day.</p>
<p>So, and you know, I got it five days after exposure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that five days is like clockwork, you know?</p>
<p>Did you have like a pulse ox?</p>
<p>Did you measure any of these other things?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Did any of that stuff change at all?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I have the pulse ox meter</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been around 95%.</p>
<p>So it is down slightly.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, you should be like 98, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, it is down slightly.</p>
<p>It is down slightly.</p>
<p>And if you go to 92 or 93,</p>
<p>they say go to the emergency room, I think.</p>
<p>And did you self-isolate from your family?</p>
<p>Yeah, I did.</p>
<p>But we were lulled a little bit</p>
<p>into a place of overconfidence because-</p>
<p>For many days, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Well, I remember I got COVID test on Wednesday</p>
<p>and then Friday and they&rsquo;re both negative.</p>
<p>I thought we&rsquo;re through it.</p>
<p>So I was at home and then so my 11-year-old got it,</p>
<p>even though I was isolating.</p>
<p>This thing is, I mean, this thing is so contagious.</p>
<p>So, you know, what I&rsquo;ve read is that Delta variant</p>
<p>is 60% more transmissible than the UK variant,</p>
<p>which was the alpha variant.</p>
<p>The alpha variant was 60% more transmissible</p>
<p>than original COVID.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re looking at a transmissibility,</p>
<p>you multiply those together</p>
<p>of two and a half times the original.</p>
<p>And the original COVID had an R-naught of two to three.</p>
<p>So you multiply two to three by two and a half times</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re looking at five to eight.</p>
<p>And, you know, at the end-</p>
<p>Explain to the audience what that means</p>
<p>in terms of reality.</p>
<p>It means the R-naught is how many people</p>
<p>does the average infected person transmit</p>
<p>before they know they have it and can fully self-isolate.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re going from, the original COVID was two to three</p>
<p>Delta variant might be like eight.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting up into like smallpox territory</p>
<p>with this thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all the more transmissible</p>
<p>because, you know, vaccinated people can get it.</p>
<p>You know, the Israel data that we talked about</p>
<p>on the show last week was 64% effectiveness</p>
<p>that Israel reported that the effectiveness of Pfizer</p>
<p>had gone from like 95% to 64%</p>
<p>in terms of preventing infection.</p>
<p>So you have maybe a third of vaccinated people can get it</p>
<p>and then they can spread it</p>
<p>without even knowing they have it.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;re at the point now where</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not vaccinated, you&rsquo;re gonna get,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get the Delta variant.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing now cases explode, you know,</p>
<p>all over the country.</p>
<p>Even in LA County, they&rsquo;ve now had a,</p>
<p>the five-day average of cases has jumped 500% in one month.</p>
<p>So pretty much, and Jason, you&rsquo;ve tweeted this.</p>
<p>If you are not vaccinated,</p>
<p>you are choosing to get the Delta variant at this point.</p>
<p>I mean, this thing is extremely transmissible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what, there was a great tweet by Scott Adams,</p>
<p>the guy who, the cartoonist, who I wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Who listens to the pod, by the way.</p>
<p>Who does listen to the pod.</p>
<p>He had a really great quote.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>today is either Wednesday.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>For those that are vaccinated</p>
<p>or yet another day where the unvaccinated amongst you</p>
<p>are likely to get COVID.</p>
<p>Something like that, right?</p>
<p>Was that the tweet?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was basically today&rsquo;s Wednesday</p>
<p>for people who are vaccinated</p>
<p>or it is the day you&rsquo;re gonna get, you know, the virus.</p>
<p>Yeah, we gotta stop messing around with this thing.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s some good news, actually, is,</p>
<p>so on the Wednesday when we found out</p>
<p>that my friend had tested positive,</p>
<p>but again, I was still negative.</p>
<p>I had no symptoms.</p>
<p>I had nothing.</p>
<p>I told my wife, she had gotten one shot.</p>
<p>She hadn&rsquo;t gotten the second shot.</p>
<p>And we were on the fence about whether my 13-year-old</p>
<p>should get the vaccine.</p>
<p>They both raced out that day, got vaccinated.</p>
<p>They did not get the virus.</p>
<p>So they had basically, call it three or four days</p>
<p>of the vaccine to trigger an immune response</p>
<p>in their system and it protected them.</p>
<p>They did not get sick.</p>
<p>And David, did you take anything else like prednisone?</p>
<p>You took nothing, no steroid?</p>
<p>No, nothing.</p>
<p>The only stuff I, so my friend did take,</p>
<p>he did get prescribed prednisone.</p>
<p>My doctor thought that was unnecessary or a bad idea for me.</p>
<p>All I took, okay, was Tylenol to control the fever</p>
<p>and I took Flonase to reduce the sinus congestion.</p>
<p>Look, I mean, I don&rsquo;t want to overstate this.</p>
<p>It was a very mild cold for me.</p>
<p>And that is why I think everybody should run out</p>
<p>and get vaccinated.</p>
<p>What did you pair it with, like a Pappy Van Winkle</p>
<p>or did you go with a Screaming Eagle?</p>
<p>What did you pair your grub with?</p>
<p>Freeburg.</p>
<p>Also, the worst part is Matsuhisa has such a shit wine list.</p>
<p>You probably drank this like random swill.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably what it was.</p>
<p>You were drinking some like nigiri sake in all likelihood.</p>
<p>Freeburg, last week I was asking you,</p>
<p>or maybe it was two weeks ago,</p>
<p>I was considering getting the Moderna</p>
<p>because I was like, I think getting two of these things</p>
<p>will boost you into the high 90s.</p>
<p>You said I was crazy.</p>
<p>Has your position changed on that?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, explain.</p>
<p>Because this is the one time</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ever going to be right about science.</p>
<p>A week before you.</p>
<p>So I think the data up to that point</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t necessarily kind of validate</p>
<p>that additional level of action, but now it does.</p>
<p>And I think new data is coming out.</p>
<p>So I saw an executive from a pharmaceutical company</p>
<p>a few days ago.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Who broke down some statistics</p>
<p>that they looked at in Israel.</p>
<p>And what they were identifying</p>
<p>was that of the newly infected cases in Israel</p>
<p>of people that are vaccinated,</p>
<p>nearly two thirds of those people were vaccinated in January.</p>
<p>About 30% were vaccinated in February</p>
<p>and less than 10% were vaccinated in March.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just approximating</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just kind of transcribing,</p>
<p>you know, from kind of what I remember him saying.</p>
<p>And so he said, you know, the more recent vaccinations</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not seeing breakthrough cases,</p>
<p>breakthrough infections.</p>
<p>So the more recently you&rsquo;re vaccinated,</p>
<p>the less likely you are to have this.</p>
<p>And then I met with a pretty well-known virologist</p>
<p>a few days ago as well,</p>
<p>who highlighted for me that we are seeing antibody titers</p>
<p>decline over time in people,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s other studies that are showing,</p>
<p>which means that the antibodies against COVID</p>
<p>in your blood after you get the vaccine</p>
<p>slowly go down over time.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re seeing that.</p>
<p>We knew that, right?</p>
<p>We knew that to some extent,</p>
<p>but there was another study that showed</p>
<p>that memory B cells,</p>
<p>B cells are the immune cells that make antibodies</p>
<p>and they remember the antibodies to make.</p>
<p>And they were worried,</p>
<p>are we losing those B cells in the human body?</p>
<p>And another study found actually they&rsquo;re in your lymph nodes.</p>
<p>So they went in, they pulled them out and they identified,</p>
<p>look, that these B cells are persistent.</p>
<p>We are having a persistent immune memory to COVID</p>
<p>when we get exposed to the vaccine or the virus.</p>
<p>And so, you know, those two data points,</p>
<p>both of them kind of said,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re gonna need to do a booster very soon</p>
<p>for everyone.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna need to get a third shot.</p>
<p>The tail Freeberg seems like it&rsquo;s like six months.</p>
<p>Yeah, it sounds like he was saying</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna see an efficacy drop</p>
<p>to that kind of two thirds level</p>
<p>after about six months of your,</p>
<p>after getting your vaccine.</p>
<p>He said, look, this Delta variant is virulent,</p>
<p>but the more pressing kind of point</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that it&rsquo;s this variant that&rsquo;s breaking through.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that the efficiency of these vaccines</p>
<p>at this point looks like it&rsquo;s such</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna need to do boosters.</p>
<p>Now, Pfizer went to the White House this week</p>
<p>with some of this data</p>
<p>and they presented it to the White House</p>
<p>and the White House said,</p>
<p>if you guys follow the news,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hearing this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m repeating what I read in news reports at this point,</p>
<p>but what they said was,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not ready to kind of commit to doing booster shots</p>
<p>for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>One is there are a lot of people out there</p>
<p>that haven&rsquo;t had their first shots.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re seeing the people</p>
<p>that are having these breakthrough infections</p>
<p>almost universally, not always,</p>
<p>but very large majority having very mild symptoms</p>
<p>and not getting hospitalized</p>
<p>and the death rate is still very, very low.</p>
<p>In other words, the vaccine did its job.</p>
<p>The vaccine didn&rsquo;t prevent an infection,</p>
<p>meaning that the virus starts replicating</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s uncontrolled in your body,</p>
<p>but that your immune system had enough of a defense</p>
<p>to keep it from causing severe disease in your body.</p>
<p>99% of the people going to the hospital</p>
<p>are unvaccinated, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re seeing that great success still</p>
<p>with the vaccine,</p>
<p>but they are seeing and there are now studies</p>
<p>that I think referenced to your earlier point</p>
<p>that if you put a different RNA strain,</p>
<p>RNA sequence into your body,</p>
<p>which Moderna and Pfizer have slightly different sequences,</p>
<p>you end up creating different antibodies</p>
<p>and having more diversity of antibodies</p>
<p>can kind of provide greater immunity.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost certain we&rsquo;re going to get boosters</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;re going to end up seeing them hit the market</p>
<p>next month in September, yeah.</p>
<p>Is the booster different than the original?</p>
<p>So for example, if I get a Pfizer booster,</p>
<p>am I only basically getting still an expression</p>
<p>of that RNA strand that I&rsquo;m supposed to basically,</p>
<p>like, is it the same formulation, the same dosage?</p>
<p>So both of those options are still up in the air.</p>
<p>And so we may still get the same vaccines</p>
<p>that we were getting before.</p>
<p>You could go get a Moderna shot,</p>
<p>you could go get another Pfizer shot</p>
<p>of the exact same RNA sequence that you got before,</p>
<p>or they may introduce some new ones.</p>
<p>And so all the pharma companies</p>
<p>are proposing both approaches</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re pursuing both paths right now</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll see where we end up.</p>
<p>And what about swapping between an RNA approach</p>
<p>and a traditional vaccine approach?</p>
<p>So getting J&amp;J plus Moderna or Pfizer versus,</p>
<p>like, there&rsquo;s a lot of A-B testing we need to do</p>
<p>to figure out what is the most efficacious</p>
<p>and useful pathway.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cocktail.</p>
<p>This is exactly like the,</p>
<p>this reminds me exactly of HIV,</p>
<p>where it took 10 years for them to figure out</p>
<p>what cocktail actually worked the best.</p>
<p>And now look, HIV is, I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of like nothing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really not that bad.</p>
<p>The way that we probably, for those of us in our 40s,</p>
<p>have it emblazoned in our mind is how bad it is</p>
<p>versus how bad it is.</p>
<p>It was a death sentence.</p>
<p>It seemed like a death sentence.</p>
<p>And today it&rsquo;s kind of more,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more manageable than, frankly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a chronic disease now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s manageable. At best, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like having diabetes or something, yeah.</p>
<p>I have another crazy statement here,</p>
<p>which is that if you take the case fatality rate of COVID,</p>
<p>and now you think about the fact that there&rsquo;s going to be,</p>
<p>call it 60% of America that&rsquo;s vaccinated,</p>
<p>and then every six months we&rsquo;ll be getting boosters,</p>
<p>and then you have the Petri dish</p>
<p>on the other side of the 40%,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ll just be ripping through variant</p>
<p>after variant after variant.</p>
<p>Eventually it stands to reason that if 40% of Americans</p>
<p>remain unvaccinated two or three years from now,</p>
<p>the odds that there will be a strain</p>
<p>that is the killer strain</p>
<p>that does meaningful damage to those people,</p>
<p>I think is basically 100%.</p>
<p>And if you think about a case fatality rate</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s meaningfully high,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re effectively going to do</p>
<p>is start to call these people from the earth.</p>
<p>And that is a crazy idea,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what folks who choose to not get vaccinated</p>
<p>are setting themselves up for.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the quintessential Darwin-</p>
<p>Is that just on probabilities?</p>
<p>Like, am I getting something wrong here probabilistically?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m concerned about.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just Americans not getting vaccinated,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the rest of the world.</p>
<p>I mean, even if we got to extraordinarily high</p>
<p>vaccination rates in the US,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be large numbers of people outside the US</p>
<p>who never get vaccinated,</p>
<p>who will continue to be a Petri dish.</p>
<p>To give you a comparison,</p>
<p>the common cold has 1800 variants.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we can&rsquo;t get vaccinated.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;re on the Delta variant right now.</p>
<p>I think they actually have numbered variants up to Lambda.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna run out of the letters</p>
<p>of the alphabet really soon.</p>
<p>How long will it be until there are these killer variants</p>
<p>that act, I mean, look, I mean,</p>
<p>that can punch through the vaccines.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty scary actually.</p>
<p>And I would say that this is like quite a comedown</p>
<p>off where we were just two weeks ago,</p>
<p>where we thought the Pfizer vaccine was still 95% effective.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s 64% effective.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I do wanna like underscore</p>
<p>that the vaccine worked in the sense</p>
<p>that what I got was super mild.</p>
<p>I mean, it was really just like getting a cold.</p>
<p>I mean, I didn&rsquo;t need to take anything more serious</p>
<p>than Tylenol,</p>
<p>but it does show that the virus is mutating really fast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s highly transmissible.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure we&rsquo;re totally done with this thing.</p>
<p>You still have it, you still have it, right?</p>
<p>I still have it, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so when will you get tested</p>
<p>to figure out when you don&rsquo;t have it anymore?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably go in tomorrow,</p>
<p>because it feels to me like I&rsquo;m about 98% better.</p>
<p>Freebrook, is there any data about the pattern</p>
<p>of people who are vaccinated getting this thing?</p>
<p>Remember how there was early data that showed</p>
<p>women had a different immune response than men</p>
<p>and people who were, what was it?</p>
<p>O positive or a certain blood type</p>
<p>effectively had inborn immunity.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard or read anything like that.</p>
<p>And so this is still an emerging issue, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, and by the way, I was vaccinated a few months ago,</p>
<p>guys, like, I mean, I am like recently vaccinated.</p>
<p>When were you at six months in?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re three of us, right?</p>
<p>When was your second shot?</p>
<p>Basically, like a few months ago.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Mine was in March, yeah.</p>
<p>One thing I think it&rsquo;s worth highlighting</p>
<p>just to reinforce the vaccine importance,</p>
<p>the virologist, the infectious disease guy I met with</p>
<p>was telling me that, one way to think about this</p>
<p>is the more opportunity the virus has to replicate,</p>
<p>the more opportunity it has to evolve.</p>
<p>And so when you&rsquo;re vaccinated and you have a mild case</p>
<p>and your body recovers in a few days,</p>
<p>just to give you guys a sense,</p>
<p>the difference when someone that&rsquo;s not vaccinated has COVID</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve measured the viral load in the nose</p>
<p>from day one when they start having their infectious</p>
<p>kind of presentation to day four, which is when they peak,</p>
<p>the viral load is 10 to the eighth higher, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like 100 million times higher.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s 100 million times more viruses</p>
<p>that are being produced on day four</p>
<p>than were being produced on day one</p>
<p>when you were already showing symptoms.</p>
<p>So every time a virus is being produced</p>
<p>and is replicating within your body,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s getting a chance to mutate.</p>
<p>The important point he emphasized was what matters most</p>
<p>is we get the most number of people on planet earth</p>
<p>vaccinated as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Because the faster you can get more people vaccinated,</p>
<p>the fewer opportunities you give the virus to replicate</p>
<p>and find itself a mutational path</p>
<p>that can ultimately break through all these vaccines</p>
<p>and cause real severe loss of life.</p>
<p>And so the presentation that Zach&rsquo;s kind of described</p>
<p>is encouraging in the sense</p>
<p>that it likely means that the virus did not create that,</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t that much of a viral load</p>
<p>or a huge viral load relative to what there would have been</p>
<p>if he wasn&rsquo;t vaccinated.</p>
<p>And so even though he did have an infection,</p>
<p>the virus didn&rsquo;t get as much of a chance to spread</p>
<p>to other people.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t get as much of a chance to mutate.</p>
<p>But it did, because my friend who I got it from</p>
<p>after having dinner one night,</p>
<p>he was double vaxxed with Pfizer</p>
<p>and my 11-year-old daughter got it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for her, again, it&rsquo;s just like a cold.</p>
<p>But so this thing is highly transmissible</p>
<p>and it changes the equation, I think,</p>
<p>on some policy questions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was gonna ask you.</p>
<p>What does it mean for the fall?</p>
<p>What now what?</p>
<p>So two weeks ago, I thought that because I was vaccinated,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t need to care whether other people were vaccinated</p>
<p>because up until that point,</p>
<p>the data was you were 95% plus effectiveness.</p>
<p>So why care if other people get vaccinated?</p>
<p>Now we can say for sure that unvaccinated people can,</p>
<p>or vaccinated people even can get,</p>
<p>other people can get you sick even if you are vaccinated.</p>
<p>So I think it absolutely changes the equation on,</p>
<p>so for example, colleges were requiring students</p>
<p>to get vaccinated to return in the fall.</p>
<p>Like before, I didn&rsquo;t think that necessarily</p>
<p>made a lot of sense because if you wanted</p>
<p>to protect yourself, you just get vaccinated.</p>
<p>But now it makes sense, right?</p>
<p>Because the college needs to get to herd immunity</p>
<p>and protect everybody against potentially Delta variant.</p>
<p>So I do think it changes the equation quite a bit.</p>
<p>And I think we need to make a big push here</p>
<p>to get everyone vaccinated.</p>
<p>Are you then in fact sacks for vax passports,</p>
<p>which as a libertarian, I think,</p>
<p>is I think part of your political,</p>
<p>I think everybody on this call</p>
<p>has kind of got a little libertarian,</p>
<p>like you gotta make your own choices here.</p>
<p>But does it change your thinking about that?</p>
<p>I employers, colleges, city, state workers,</p>
<p>teachers are either get vaxed</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t come back to the office and you&rsquo;re fired?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you, I don&rsquo;t like the idea</p>
<p>of government having the power</p>
<p>to stick a needle in your arm.</p>
<p>But I do think that employers, workplaces, schools,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very reasonable for them to say,</p>
<p>if you wanna come back to the workplace,</p>
<p>you have to get vaccinated</p>
<p>because your unvaccinated status creates a risk.</p>
<p>It creates an externality for everybody else.</p>
<p>Should they be able to fire you?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a teacher, should they be able to fire you?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a bus driver, if you&rsquo;re a pilot?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, so here&rsquo;s the craziness.</p>
<p>This is a self inflicted wound.</p>
<p>We are down to only 700,000 vaccines being given a day.</p>
<p>We peaked, we had the ability</p>
<p>to do 5 million shots a day at the peak.</p>
<p>Back in April, we hit over 5 million shots</p>
<p>in one day in the United States.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a country where, whatever,</p>
<p>270 million adults were able to get it.</p>
<p>In other words, 2% of the adult population</p>
<p>in a single day could have gotten it.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re down to 700.</p>
<p>We have over a billion vaccines sitting on shelves.</p>
<p>80% of Democrats have received one shot</p>
<p>compared to 49% of Republicans.</p>
<p>27% of Republicans say that they won&rsquo;t get vaccinated</p>
<p>under any circumstances compared to 3% of Democrats</p>
<p>answering that question the same way.</p>
<p>And an additional 9% will only do so if required.</p>
<p>Again, 3% of Democrats said</p>
<p>they would only do so if required.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s 36% are opting out forever.</p>
<p>I get it, but it&rsquo;s because we allowed it</p>
<p>to become a position.</p>
<p>Meaning, it&rsquo;s not like anybody has a position on breathing.</p>
<p>Breathing is not a political position, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I choose to not breathe</p>
<p>or drinking water or trying to, you know,</p>
<p>like eating three meals a day if you can.</p>
<p>We have allowed the most basic of issues,</p>
<p>in this case, you know, collective public health</p>
<p>to be politicized in a way,</p>
<p>and that is entirely the government&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the government&rsquo;s fault, and it&rsquo;s the media&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>And media.</p>
<p>And the media, because look.</p>
<p>Well, the media has exacerbated it</p>
<p>so that they can have power.</p>
<p>People on the conservative side of the spectrum</p>
<p>have learned to distrust the media and big corporations</p>
<p>because, and government,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve been lied to so often.</p>
<p>Most recently with the whole. Rightfully so.</p>
<p>Yeah, right. Sure.</p>
<p>Most recently with like the lab leak theory.</p>
<p>And so, you know, there&rsquo;s this suspicion on the right,</p>
<p>like what aren&rsquo;t they telling us, you know?</p>
<p>Now, look, I think we gotta get over this.</p>
<p>I think, you know, we need to get everyone vaccinated</p>
<p>for all the reasons that Freeberg said,</p>
<p>or look, everyone&rsquo;s gonna get Delta variant.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe this is a good news</p>
<p>is that we can rapidly get to herd immunity</p>
<p>by everyone getting Delta variant.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the inevitable outcome</p>
<p>for any infectious disease, right?</p>
<p>Highly infectious disease is either you can vaccinate</p>
<p>or everyone&rsquo;s gonna get it and it&rsquo;s gonna, you know.</p>
<p>I mean, better Delta variant maybe than whatever the,</p>
<p>you know, whatever.</p>
<p>The more dangerous deadly one is, yeah.</p>
<p>Let me just highlight what I&rsquo;m most concerned about.</p>
<p>I am most concerned about what&rsquo;s happening with SAX.</p>
<p>Just anecdotally speaking, I&rsquo;m not gonna speak to the,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll speak to one statistic, but like anecdotally speaking,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hearing this happening more frequently.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you guys, other friends,</p>
<p>other people you know, but a lot of other people</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hearing about their double vacs</p>
<p>that are now getting COVID.</p>
<p>So as that starts to happen,</p>
<p>the implications for the economy,</p>
<p>I think are pretty significant.</p>
<p>Because I think people,</p>
<p>whether there&rsquo;s a policy change or not,</p>
<p>people are gonna get scared again.</p>
<p>And people, if we&rsquo;re not kind of enforcing</p>
<p>economic lockdown, people will go into social lockdown.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna revisit, you know,</p>
<p>more of the behavior we saw over the past year,</p>
<p>where people are gonna be nervous to travel,</p>
<p>people are gonna be nervous to fly,</p>
<p>people are gonna be nervous to go to restaurants.</p>
<p>And, you know, the downstream consequences</p>
<p>of everyone kind of locking up again,</p>
<p>even if the government doesn&rsquo;t enforce lockups,</p>
<p>it could be pretty catastrophic, especially-</p>
<p>Are you feeling that way yourself, Friberg?</p>
<p>In other words-</p>
<p>Am I gonna lock myself up?</p>
<p>Are you gonna go to dinner?</p>
<p>Are you gonna go to travel to Italy or to, you know, Japan?</p>
<p>Or, you know, would you go to Disneyland with your kids?</p>
<p>How is it affecting you,</p>
<p>your personal behavior being a man of science?</p>
<p>So my personal circumstances</p>
<p>are a little different right now.</p>
<p>Not to get into it.</p>
<p>Just with my, you know, my wife&rsquo;s pregnant</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re moving houses.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve got a bunch of reasons</p>
<p>why we&rsquo;re not traveling</p>
<p>and exposing ourselves unnecessarily right now.</p>
<p>But I would say that at this point, you know,</p>
<p>if all other things being equal,</p>
<p>would I go to Disneyland with my kids?</p>
<p>I would probably wait right now,</p>
<p>six to 12 weeks to see what happens here.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so I think like, if I&rsquo;m feeling that way now,</p>
<p>I think a lot of people are gonna be feeling that way</p>
<p>in the next four weeks</p>
<p>as they hear about more friends getting COVID.</p>
<p>Now, you know, the good news is the hospital is&hellip;</p>
<p>And so I am most concerned.</p>
<p>We are in a very, very, very, very delicate</p>
<p>economic recovery right now.</p>
<p>And, you know, we have put out so much money</p>
<p>to stimulate this economy.</p>
<p>Everyone is so walking on like the razor&rsquo;s edge</p>
<p>to keep things, you know, growing.</p>
<p>We were afraid of inflation.</p>
<p>Lumber prices today, by the way,</p>
<p>are lower than they were</p>
<p>when this whole kind of inflationary thing started</p>
<p>and everyone was freaking out about it.</p>
<p>So, you know, lumber prices are lower than they were</p>
<p>at the start of the year,</p>
<p>which is, you know,</p>
<p>like a lot of this kind of inflation risk</p>
<p>has kind of come out of the equation already.</p>
<p>So the markets have taken that pricing out.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re going to be in a circumstance</p>
<p>where people might cancel their travel,</p>
<p>people might cancel their restaurants,</p>
<p>people might stop going to the office again,</p>
<p>stop, you know, getting in the car, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So I am most concerned about like the psychological effects</p>
<p>of what we&rsquo;re seeing with these breakthrough infections,</p>
<p>the frequency of them.</p>
<p>Now, if you look at the Israel data,</p>
<p>so Israel had zero deaths for two weeks.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re now averaging about one death a day.</p>
<p>And despite this, you know, huge increment,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting about, I think,</p>
<p>500 breakthrough infections a day right now.</p>
<p>So that is good statistical news, right?</p>
<p>Statistically, these breakthrough infections are not fatal.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not causing hospitalizations.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>if you kind of did the math going back a year</p>
<p>and said, these are the actual statistics of COVID,</p>
<p>people would be like, okay, no big deal.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tough kind of virus.</p>
<p>But because of the circumstances</p>
<p>where we are kind of under these feelings</p>
<p>that this is a fatal disease and could cause fatalities,</p>
<p>those statistics don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>The fear is what matters.</p>
<p>And people are gonna start to behave quite differently,</p>
<p>I think, in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>I have a slightly different point of view here,</p>
<p>but I think, Friberg,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right in some respects.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s gonna come from people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people,</p>
<p>I think people are exhausted</p>
<p>and they wanna go back to life as normal.</p>
<p>And I think this summer was a window</p>
<p>into some amount of normalcy for a lot of us.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think we really do wanna go back.</p>
<p>And so I think what&rsquo;s really going to happen</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s going to be essentially</p>
<p>some form of class warfare.</p>
<p>And instead of rich versus poor and left versus right,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of between people who believe in science</p>
<p>and then the ideologically dogmatic who refuse to get it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s gonna play itself out economically.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be meaningful forms</p>
<p>of economic discrimination against people</p>
<p>who are unnecessarily compounding risk for the rest of us</p>
<p>who want to deal with it, ideally, touch wood,</p>
<p>as a common cold, like David said, and move the fuck on.</p>
<p>And if we are prevented from doing so,</p>
<p>because economic policy and healthcare policy</p>
<p>has to constantly get re-rated for a cohort of people</p>
<p>who could protect themselves and everybody else</p>
<p>but chooses not to,</p>
<p>there is going to be a real pushback on that.</p>
<p>The second thing that I think is gonna happen</p>
<p>is politicians proved that if you give them a window</p>
<p>to seize power, they will do it.</p>
<p>And I think what&rsquo;s really gonna happen in the fall</p>
<p>is if there&rsquo;s even a small modicum of risk,</p>
<p>which there will be, as we just talked about.</p>
<p>Yeah, it exists now.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the politicians</p>
<p>that are gonna wanna jump all over this and say,</p>
<p>okay, guys, lockdown&rsquo;s here, you can&rsquo;t do this,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>So literally Gavin Newsom just did the big grand reopening,</p>
<p>California&rsquo;s back,</p>
<p>you could see him locking it back up in September.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s the best way to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the best way to snuff out any chance</p>
<p>of the recall going against him</p>
<p>is that even if you were angry,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna be allowed to,</p>
<p>basically, it&rsquo;ll be a massive form of voter suppression.</p>
<p>Well, I think that would backfire on him.</p>
<p>That would backfire pretty bad.</p>
<p>You saw the flip-flopping</p>
<p>that he already did actually on schools</p>
<p>where the government of California basically said,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re gonna mandate a mask policy in the fall.</p>
<p>And then Newsom came out because people freaked out</p>
<p>and said, actually, no,</p>
<p>each local municipality can figure it out</p>
<p>based on what it means for them.</p>
<p>So the point is, guys, Freebrook is right.</p>
<p>These things aren&rsquo;t going away.</p>
<p>We have a cohort of people who will continue</p>
<p>to allow this thing to become worse than it has to be.</p>
<p>And I think that there will be economic repercussions</p>
<p>and discrimination against those people for that.</p>
<p>And I think economically,</p>
<p>we are going to take a step back</p>
<p>because politicians will try to slow the economy down again.</p>
<p>And there is definitely from the right,</p>
<p>not to get political here,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve been pretty silent</p>
<p>about encouraging people to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>And at CPAC and other places,</p>
<p>people were cheering the anti-vax movement.</p>
<p>Mitt Romney came out.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t control conservative media figures</p>
<p>so far as I know, at least I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That being said, I think it&rsquo;s an enormous error</p>
<p>for anyone to suggest that we shouldn&rsquo;t be taking vaccines.</p>
<p>Look, the politicization of vaccination</p>
<p>is an outrage and frankly, moronic.</p>
<p>Mitch McConnell came out and said,</p>
<p>as a polio victim myself when I was young,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve studied that disease.</p>
<p>It took 70 years, 70 years to come up with two vaccines</p>
<p>that finally ended the polio threat.</p>
<p>As a result of Operation Warp Speed,</p>
<p>we have not one, not two,</p>
<p>but three highly effective vaccines.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m perplexed by the difficulty</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re having finishing the job.</p>
<p>This is where you can expect</p>
<p>the politically correct companies to act first</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re the woke mob</p>
<p>will force some action on this issue.</p>
<p>Whether you like it or not,</p>
<p>but this is where the next petition will come from Apple.</p>
<p>Where the two or 3,000 employees who are vaccinated,</p>
<p>et cetera, who have people with,</p>
<p>people in their households who are immunologically suppressed</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna say, hey guys, this is crazy.</p>
<p>Well, that petition might be the first Apple petition</p>
<p>that would make sense</p>
<p>because those employees are directly impacted</p>
<p>by other employees who come to the workplace unvaccinated.</p>
<p>Unlike the issues around Israel or Antonio&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>whatever that they shouldn&rsquo;t have taken a position on.</p>
<p>Wait a second, you&rsquo;re saying Antonio&rsquo;s book</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t make them feel safe</p>
<p>and getting COVID would make them unsafe?</p>
<p>Yeah, actually, yes.</p>
<p>Yes, he&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>COVID in the workplace is a real safety issue.</p>
<p>Not whether somebody wrote a book five years ago.</p>
<p>So I think employees do have a right</p>
<p>to say to their employers, listen,</p>
<p>are we gonna be a vaccinated workplace or not?</p>
<p>Because it does impact their risk.</p>
<p>But Jason, it&rsquo;s your question about</p>
<p>should people change their behavior in light of this news?</p>
<p>In light of the fact that we now are learning</p>
<p>about some reduced effectiveness of the vaccines.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I would tell people sitting where I am.</p>
<p>This is not a big deal.</p>
<p>I mean, for me, it was not a big deal.</p>
<p>It was like a mild cold.</p>
<p>I am not gonna change my, I&rsquo;m gonna go back to normal,</p>
<p>like my pre-COVID behavior.</p>
<p>And I would tell you, if you&rsquo;re double vax,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you need to be that afraid of this</p>
<p>because my doctor said they are seeing</p>
<p>a bunch of these breakthrough cases,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re all very mild.</p>
<p>It really is like getting a cold.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not changing my behaviors.</p>
<p>I made my decision.</p>
<p>My risk assessment is if I get it,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m doubly protected.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not gonna wind up in the hospital.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna focus all my energy on riding my bike</p>
<p>and taking my kids out and having a good time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going back in lockdown.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s right for you.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s where it gets a little bit complicated</p>
<p>is my parents who are in their 70s,</p>
<p>and one of them has an immune condition,</p>
<p>asked what they should do.</p>
<p>And I said, listen, if I were you guys,</p>
<p>I would not be going to public places.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be masking up.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re asking me if they should go on a trip.</p>
<p>And I said, no, I would actually, if I were you,</p>
<p>I would lock down until this blows over</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re at elevated risk.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, for me, getting COVID was like a mild case,</p>
<p>but for them, maybe it could be more serious.</p>
<p>So all it takes is 10% of the population</p>
<p>acting like what you just described,</p>
<p>you recommended to your parents sex</p>
<p>for there to be economic ripples associated</p>
<p>with this breakthrough kind of condition for a while.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I have the most concern</p>
<p>is again, like, you know, we&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not concerned about the debts, Friedberg,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re concerned about the economic impact</p>
<p>and the psychological scars that are now in place.</p>
<p>I will explain, I sent you guys a link</p>
<p>to the Reuters article where they covered</p>
<p>the press conference with the Prime Minister of Israel</p>
<p>the other day.</p>
<p>And basically they are taking what they&rsquo;re calling</p>
<p>a soft suppression strategy,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re encouraging Israelis</p>
<p>to learn to live with the virus,</p>
<p>involving the fewest possible restrictions</p>
<p>and avoiding a fourth national lockdown</p>
<p>that could do further harm to the economy.</p>
<p>And he said, implementing the strategy</p>
<p>will entail taking certain risks,</p>
<p>but in the overall consideration,</p>
<p>including economic factors,</p>
<p>this is the necessary balance.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a very kind of pointed position</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re coming to.</p>
<p>I think the US government, the federal government</p>
<p>is gonna have to come to the same one,</p>
<p>but we have different states</p>
<p>and different local governments</p>
<p>that are gonna act differently.</p>
<p>And because we&rsquo;ve, you know, we have authority</p>
<p>vested in those different jurisdictions,</p>
<p>you could see different public policy officials</p>
<p>take different positions in what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>If San Francisco said restaurants</p>
<p>have to go back to 25% capacity,</p>
<p>it would decimate these already struggling small businesses</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no more stimulus dollars available.</p>
<p>And so you kind of think about this,</p>
<p>or 10% of people cancel their vacation plans.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that gonna do to airlines and hotels?</p>
<p>So again, my concern is,</p>
<p>are we about to hit a wave of economic ripples</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t necessarily tied to what is the right thing</p>
<p>to do from a policy perspective</p>
<p>or a science or health perspective,</p>
<p>but really the psychological effects</p>
<p>of the scared and concerned saying,</p>
<p>you know what, there&rsquo;s more money available.</p>
<p>Like, you know, we got bailed out before,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get bailed out again.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s implement a shutdown.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s implement a lockdown.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not go to work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s whatever the decision tree you may have</p>
<p>as a business owner or policymaker.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s an important point here, which is,</p>
<p>listen, COVID is gonna be with us for a long time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna need to make really smart</p>
<p>cost benefit analysis decisions in how to deal with it.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t go back to lockdowns because they didn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re extremely expensive.</p>
<p>We spent $10 trillion battling COVID last year.</p>
<p>We cannot do that again.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the bullets</p>
<p>that are gonna keep firing at this thing like that.</p>
<p>We gotta start making intelligent decisions.</p>
<p>Zeroism is not gonna work.</p>
<p>This idea that the premise of zeroism</p>
<p>is that we can stamp out every last vestige of COVID.</p>
<p>Maybe that was even a possibility</p>
<p>when vaccines were 99% effective,</p>
<p>but now that they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no chance of stamping out COVID.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got to, like the Israel example,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got to learn to live with this thing</p>
<p>and make smart cost benefit decisions.</p>
<p>But I also think this is kind of a disaster for humanity.</p>
<p>We now have this new category of illness</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s rapidly mutating.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what the end of it&rsquo;s gonna be.</p>
<p>Like I said, there&rsquo;s 1,800 variants of the common cold.</p>
<p>You know what though, David?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s causing these symptoms.</p>
<p>By the way, has anyone noticed</p>
<p>how many different symptoms this virus causes in people?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s over 200 long-haul COVID symptoms.</p>
<p>Well, they worked on it for a long time, David,</p>
<p>in fairness.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Everyone knows it&rsquo;s a lab-engineered virus</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s now a plague on humanity.</p>
<p>This is really a disaster.</p>
<p>This is gonna, I think,</p>
<p>permanently impact human life expectancy.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a serious problem.</p>
<p>We could have avoided this entire thing,</p>
<p>here in the United States, at least,</p>
<p>if people just took the win.</p>
<p>How frustrating is this,</p>
<p>that we would probably have cases down to 1,000 a day</p>
<p>and deaths down to 10 a day, like Israel,</p>
<p>if we had just gotten everybody</p>
<p>to take one of the billions of excess vaccines</p>
<p>sitting on shelves and in CVSs</p>
<p>and Walgreens across this country?</p>
<p>How stupid are we?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the collectivism to make those actions.</p>
<p>If you think about what&rsquo;s happening in-</p>
<p>Israel did.</p>
<p>Two different examples.</p>
<p>In China, collectivism manifests</p>
<p>as basically a top-down form of governance.</p>
<p>In Israel, collectivism comes from</p>
<p>a need for state-level security.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve traveled to Israel a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s crazy when you see how people cooperate together</p>
<p>the minute you hear the missile alarms.</p>
<p>And so there is a way for people</p>
<p>to do cost-benefit analyses in Israel</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a matter of life or death.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve been trained to do that.</p>
<p>So either it&rsquo;s imposed on you, like in China,</p>
<p>or people bottoms-up can understand</p>
<p>these trade-offs like in Israel.</p>
<p>We are in a very different place</p>
<p>where literally what we have are three things</p>
<p>that are in conflict with each other, Jason.</p>
<p>We have politics and the desire for power.</p>
<p>We have the deconstruction of power</p>
<p>by social media.</p>
<p>And then we have the traditional media</p>
<p>trying to stay relevant.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a toxic thing that&rsquo;s spinning around</p>
<p>and spinning around and spinning around</p>
<p>trying to allocate this very ephemeral thing</p>
<p>called power and influence.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know how it works anymore.</p>
<p>And so we cannot get our shit together.</p>
<p>Half the people care about vegan fucking milk.</p>
<p>The other half of the people care.</p>
<p>I mean, we are in an alternate universe.</p>
<p>As bad as we are,</p>
<p>Europe and even Japan have done even worse</p>
<p>because, I mean, our government was fairly efficient</p>
<p>about the distribution of the vaccines.</p>
<p>In Europe, they&rsquo;ve just completely botched it.</p>
<p>Same thing in Japan.</p>
<p>So we are not the worst on vaccination rates.</p>
<p>Yes, it should be better, but this is a global problem.</p>
<p>Well, we are the worst on capturing</p>
<p>the opportunity, David.</p>
<p>We have the opportunity to have everybody vaccinated.</p>
<p>America is the most exceptional country in the world.</p>
<p>It has been for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>It should be for several hundred more.</p>
<p>There is no excuse for this country</p>
<p>to have fucked this up this badly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent enough time, as you guys have in Europe</p>
<p>and in Japan, it&rsquo;s understandable why those countries</p>
<p>are in the positions they&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>It is not understandable why America&rsquo;s in the position.</p>
<p>So dumb.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like having a 20-point lead</p>
<p>and you just, with like eight minutes to go</p>
<p>and you just screw up and you lose the game.</p>
<p>So stupid.</p>
<p>All right, do we want to move on</p>
<p>to the billionaire space race?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s positive news.</p>
<p>This company, what&rsquo;s it called, Virgin Galactic?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a company called Virgin Galactic</p>
<p>and they take people to space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s $200,000, stock seems to be doing pretty well.</p>
<p>Anybody have thoughts on Richard Branson getting to space?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, let&rsquo;s just randomly go to somebody.</p>
<p>Chamath?</p>
<p>No, congratulations, in all seriousness, congratulations.</p>
<p>I cried.</p>
<p>Nat and I-</p>
<p>Start the SEC transcript, public statement, here we go.</p>
<p>Nat and I watched it together.</p>
<p>You cried?</p>
<p>And it was emotional.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s emotional because you know,</p>
<p>I mean, being a little bit more on the inside,</p>
<p>how hard they worked.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve all been there</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re all toiling in obscurity,</p>
<p>where there are moments where everybody thinks</p>
<p>that what you&rsquo;re doing either is crazy</p>
<p>or isn&rsquo;t gonna work or is gonna fail.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a moment</p>
<p>where you just have to push through it, right?</p>
<p>And find people that believe in you.</p>
<p>I think I came in very late to that,</p>
<p>but I had the opportunity to find these incredible people,</p>
<p>believe in them, help them, give them capital,</p>
<p>which was essentially oxygen, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s oxygen for a company.</p>
<p>And then to see them achieve it,</p>
<p>it felt so special to be a part of it.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, I was really emotional</p>
<p>and it was beautiful.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I think this is the beginning of the beginning.</p>
<p>I tweeted this out,</p>
<p>but basically, if you think about,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s other stuff that we can&rsquo;t talk about</p>
<p>with some other companies that we are all involved in,</p>
<p>David and I particularly,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the point, guys,</p>
<p>between sending people</p>
<p>and making us an interplanetary species</p>
<p>by creating pervasive internet access</p>
<p>and by enabling us to safely and reliably transport people,</p>
<p>either point to point, suborbitally,</p>
<p>or basically into space,</p>
<p>we are completely re-imagining how the human race can work.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And to be a part of that is really special.</p>
<p>There was a lot of people who got very negative</p>
<p>on Twitter, I noticed.</p>
<p>There was a lot of people that said,</p>
<p>oh, well, you know, no, like, you know,</p>
<p>maybe now we can deal with, I don&rsquo;t know, child hunger,</p>
<p>or, you know, hey,</p>
<p>why are all these billionaires doing this out of the other?</p>
<p>And I took a step back and I thought,</p>
<p>my gosh, A, people are,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a small virulent cohort of people</p>
<p>that are incredibly negative.</p>
<p>And B, doesn&rsquo;t even know what they&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re talking about issues of state responsibility</p>
<p>and confusing it for what private citizens are doing</p>
<p>to advance a set of technologies</p>
<p>that I think have broad appeal.</p>
<p>So those are my thoughts.</p>
<p>I mean, I was, I watched every minute of it</p>
<p>and I thought it was incredible.</p>
<p>Just to add to that, yeah,</p>
<p>I wanna take the part that all the naysayers</p>
<p>and the negativity, I mean, Chamath is right.</p>
<p>All the very online people immediately came out</p>
<p>attacking this extraordinary accomplishment</p>
<p>and act of bravery by Branson.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a billionaire.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t need to be risking his life</p>
<p>launching himself into space.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a courageous act.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s putting his life where his mouth is.</p>
<p>And you had all these very online people,</p>
<p>but you had one CNN commentator basically said</p>
<p>this was bad for the environment.</p>
<p>You had another one saying that, calling him a tax cheat.</p>
<p>Then there was another whiner who said,</p>
<p>what about all the starving children in the world?</p>
<p>I mean, it just went on and on like this.</p>
<p>And Mike Solana had a pretty funny tweet</p>
<p>summing up the sort of the left&rsquo;s argument thusly.</p>
<p>He said, number one, this is their argument</p>
<p>according to Solana.</p>
<p>One, money is evil.</p>
<p>Two, therefore people with money are evil.</p>
<p>Three, therefore things people with money care about</p>
<p>are evil.</p>
<p>I mean, that is basically the level of sophistication</p>
<p>of the argument that&rsquo;s being made.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the argument that the left is making.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s a Bond villain.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the problem is that first of all,</p>
<p>we do get tremendous benefits out of these innovators</p>
<p>who are pushing the boundaries of science</p>
<p>and technology and engineering.</p>
<p>You know, Branson actually went on Stephen Colbert&rsquo;s show</p>
<p>and defended it.</p>
<p>He said, listen, I think they&rsquo;re not fully,</p>
<p>this is Branson.</p>
<p>He said, I think they&rsquo;re not fully educated</p>
<p>to what space does for earth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s connecting the billions of people</p>
<p>who are not connected down here.</p>
<p>He said, every single spaceship that we&rsquo;ve sent,</p>
<p>putting satellites up there,</p>
<p>monitoring different things around the world,</p>
<p>like the degradation of rainforest,</p>
<p>monitoring food distribution,</p>
<p>even monitoring things like climate change.</p>
<p>These things are essential for us back on earth.</p>
<p>So we need more spaceships going up to space, not less.</p>
<p>So, you know, they&rsquo;re really just kind of ignorant</p>
<p>about the benefits of technology.</p>
<p>And what do they want to do with the money anyway?</p>
<p>Yes, we do have all these problems on earth,</p>
<p>but so many of our problems</p>
<p>are not a problem of underfunding.</p>
<p>We have tons of money</p>
<p>going to the problem of homelessness in California.</p>
<p>It just keeps getting worse</p>
<p>because we have the wrong approach on education.</p>
<p>We have very-</p>
<p>We have the wrong ideas.</p>
<p>We have the wrong organization.</p>
<p>We have the wrong execution.</p>
<p>Fix the operating details.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a money issue.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Take education in California.</p>
<p>We have very high levels of per pupil spending</p>
<p>and our test scores keep going down.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because we have unions controlling the schools.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no competition.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, David.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting rid of testing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve eliminated testing.</p>
<p>We solved that problem.</p>
<p>We spent more as a percentage of GDP on healthcare</p>
<p>than any other Western country in the world.</p>
<p>Yet the life expectancy of white men,</p>
<p>which is basically the top of the pyramid of healthcare</p>
<p>is now sub 80 years old.</p>
<p>What is going on?</p>
<p>If all of these negative naysayers</p>
<p>could actually just get into the arena</p>
<p>and try to do something.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Instead of whining-</p>
<p>Just stop whining.</p>
<p>Professional whiner class.</p>
<p>They have no ideas.</p>
<p>They have no ideas.</p>
<p>They have no solutions.</p>
<p>They just have gripes.</p>
<p>And no ability to execute, apparently.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t they come up with new programs,</p>
<p>actually test new programs at a hyper local level</p>
<p>to see what works.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Can I tell you why?</p>
<p>Can I tell you why?</p>
<p>These sort of like leftist whiners</p>
<p>are not motivated to actually do the hard work.</p>
<p>Meaning, even if they have an idea for education,</p>
<p>the precondition to working on an education program</p>
<p>or a healthcare program is they may need to spend</p>
<p>four or five years in the bowels, in obscurity,</p>
<p>just learning.</p>
<p>Paying their dues.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to do that either.</p>
<p>Because they grew up in a culture of kindergarten soccer.</p>
<p>Everybody gets the gold star.</p>
<p>Everybody gets to touch the ball.</p>
<p>Everybody gets to be at the front of the line.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not willing to put in the work</p>
<p>because the minute they realize how much actual work</p>
<p>is demanded of progress,</p>
<p>they run away because they&rsquo;re scared.</p>
<p>And the reason they&rsquo;re scared</p>
<p>is because somewhere along the way, somebody tricked them.</p>
<p>That it was not actually about trying,</p>
<p>it was actually about succeeding.</p>
<p>And that is the biggest failure that we could do to people</p>
<p>is all of a sudden tricking them to believe</p>
<p>you have to have it work.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;d rather be hall monitors,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d rather be critics.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;d rather be critics than try.</p>
<p>Failure is just as good</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re one step closer to succeeding.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, unfortunately,</p>
<p>they were not taught that incredible secret</p>
<p>hiding in plain sight.</p>
<p>Friedberg, what do you think of the space race</p>
<p>and the hall monitor Weiner class?</p>
<p>If you guys look,</p>
<p>I was going to send these statistics earlier,</p>
<p>but if you look at the amount of venture capital money</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gone into private space companies,</p>
<p>space technology companies,</p>
<p>I think it was a few hundred million dollars,</p>
<p>call it three to $400 million,</p>
<p>pretty consistently from 2011 through 2014, pretty flat.</p>
<p>And then in 2015,</p>
<p>I think this is when SpaceX started</p>
<p>to kind of create a lot of momentum and hype</p>
<p>that private companies can&rsquo;t actually build businesses</p>
<p>in kind of call it the space industry.</p>
<p>The number jumped to $3 billion a year.</p>
<p>And then it was a little over $3.5 billion in 16.</p>
<p>And then it jumped to almost $5 billion in 17.</p>
<p>It was a little bit down in 18.</p>
<p>2020, it&rsquo;s climbed to almost $10 billion.</p>
<p>And in Q1 of this year,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re at $2 billion of venture capital money</p>
<p>going into private space companies.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s clearly a great deal of momentum</p>
<p>in this industry.</p>
<p>The question is always, what&rsquo;s the market at the end?</p>
<p>And so if you break out, how do these companies make money?</p>
<p>One is to provide services to governments,</p>
<p>launch services and taking people to the space station</p>
<p>and what have you.</p>
<p>And SpaceX has obviously built a tremendous business</p>
<p>in that there has been obviously a lot of interest</p>
<p>in tourism.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re seeing this first breakthrough</p>
<p>with Virgin Galactic.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna find out over the next couple of years,</p>
<p>is there a tourism market?</p>
<p>Historically, there&rsquo;s been interest in a market</p>
<p>for visual satellites.</p>
<p>But if you look at some of the financials of companies</p>
<p>like Planet Labs,</p>
<p>they did a few acquisitions in space imaging.</p>
<p>And the revenue hasn&rsquo;t really taken off there.</p>
<p>And then mining was always this other question</p>
<p>is can we go out and mine rare minerals from space?</p>
<p>And that one is just, if you do the math on it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so far away, it&rsquo;s impossible to kind of model.</p>
<p>So I think over the next&hellip;</p>
<p>And then finally, it&rsquo;s communications.</p>
<p>And communications are cheaper to run on earth</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in cities versus the SpaceX model</p>
<p>is to reach rural areas</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s gonna be more affordable to do this through space.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s obviously a ton of momentum</p>
<p>and a ton of interest in private companies getting to space.</p>
<p>Everyone right now, it seems,</p>
<p>is trying to figure out what&rsquo;s the market, right?</p>
<p>How big is the market?</p>
<p>How big is the business?</p>
<p>And how quickly can you actually see that capital</p>
<p>turn around into real revenue?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this kind of market question</p>
<p>that I think is still outstanding.</p>
<p>In terms of the opportunity,</p>
<p>if you go back to like the 15th century,</p>
<p>I think something like 60 to 70% of ships,</p>
<p>maritime travel, got into shipwrecks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s around when we sailed across the Atlantic</p>
<p>or the Spanish sailed across the Atlantic</p>
<p>or funded.</p>
<p>No, or they disappeared.</p>
<p>Or they disappeared.</p>
<p>I mean, they basically crashed.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>It was a one-way trip,</p>
<p>sometimes to the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p>If you were sitting in Spain in 1450,</p>
<p>and someone said,</p>
<p>hey, these ships, it&rsquo;s gonna be a great business.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna build lots of ships and we&rsquo;re gonna go out.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll get trade routes going.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll discover new land.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll make money.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll take people on trips on these ships.</p>
<p>You would be like, this is crazy.</p>
<p>Half the people are dying.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no market on the other side.</p>
<p>So, we are in that kind of-</p>
<p>And you would have been totally wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you are in that 15th century moment right now</p>
<p>with the space industry.</p>
<p>Great analogy.</p>
<p>Would anyone in the ship business in the 15th century</p>
<p>have been able to predict carnival cruise lines</p>
<p>or been able to predict evergreen ships</p>
<p>taking stuff from China to America</p>
<p>with these huge shipping crates?</p>
<p>Would anyone have been able to predict</p>
<p>going down to the bottom of the Atlantic?</p>
<p>I mean, all of the technology and the entire industry</p>
<p>that came out of that set of pioneering activity</p>
<p>in the 15th century transformed the planet,</p>
<p>transformed the economy, transformed humanity.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very hard to sit here today and say,</p>
<p>hey, I know where the space industry is going.</p>
<p>I know what&rsquo;s gonna be possible.</p>
<p>But I can tell you that if history</p>
<p>is any predictor of the future,</p>
<p>this pioneering work that&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>which is burning tons of money</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s kind of questioning</p>
<p>whether there&rsquo;s businesses here,</p>
<p>it could transform our species once again.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>David, your 15th century shipping example is so beautiful.</p>
<p>Three things that came out of that,</p>
<p>which I think we all value.</p>
<p>One, insurance.</p>
<p>Two, tort law.</p>
<p>And carry.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And three was basically how they did risk management</p>
<p>so that each ship would take a little piece</p>
<p>of everybody else&rsquo;s cargo</p>
<p>so that some of the cargo would always get to.</p>
<p>Marketplaces emerged.</p>
<p>Lloyd&rsquo;s of London came about. Marketplaces.</p>
<p>Yeah, Lloyd&rsquo;s of London emerged</p>
<p>because of the maritime insurance that was required.</p>
<p>And almost all PNC insurance can trace its roots</p>
<p>back to maritime insurance during that era.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And so these ancillary industries that emerged</p>
<p>were like surprising, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost business models emerged</p>
<p>because you had to figure out how you do the arbitrage.</p>
<p>And carry is the perfect example.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t understand that venture capital carry,</p>
<p>where you get 20% of the profits,</p>
<p>was designed so that people with ships,</p>
<p>the captain would get to say,</p>
<p>we get 20% of whatever makes it there.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re aligned.</p>
<p>Whatever makes it there, you get 20% of,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m gonna go through that storm</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna try to get it there.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many unknowns.</p>
<p>But just looking at the one thing, Starlink,</p>
<p>I was doing a little research today</p>
<p>about internet penetration.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got close to 5 billion people on the internet now,</p>
<p>but a very small number of them are on broadband.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 20%, 30%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to get an exact number there.</p>
<p>But if you think about what&rsquo;s gonna happen to humanity,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about billions of people</p>
<p>who did not have access to broadband,</p>
<p>and they are going to go from not having,</p>
<p>if you think about what we went through in the West</p>
<p>when the internet first came out</p>
<p>and we got our first broadband connections,</p>
<p>defined as like DSL or whatever.</p>
<p>We had libraries, we had books, we had colleges,</p>
<p>we had stores everywhere, Barnes and Noble.</p>
<p>So the internet was unbelievably transformative,</p>
<p>but we were in a modern society.</p>
<p>Now you go to the developing world</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna go from not even having running water</p>
<p>in some cases in their homes or electricity</p>
<p>or variable to having broadband.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re gonna have access to YouTube circa 2022, 2023.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna have access to MIT courseware or brilliant.org</p>
<p>and all of this information and shopping.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna take a billion or 2 billion people</p>
<p>and give them broadband instantly within a decade.</p>
<p>This is gonna change the face of the planet.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s the revolution.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just Starlink doing it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like three competitors to Starlink.</p>
<p>Obviously, Starlink&rsquo;s got the biggest lead.</p>
<p>Yeah, before SpaceX doing this and there were others,</p>
<p>there was a company called O3B.</p>
<p>It stood for other 3 billion</p>
<p>and they had raised a ton of money to do this.</p>
<p>By the way, I just wanna speak to like a trend</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve seen and also speak to the quality</p>
<p>of Elon&rsquo;s leadership.</p>
<p>So many companies have tried this.</p>
<p>Google talked about it for years,</p>
<p>which is how do you connect-</p>
<p>No, Project Loon, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, Project Loon was a follow-on</p>
<p>to what we talked about early on at Google,</p>
<p>which was putting up satellites.</p>
<p>And ultimately, Google had a satellite program</p>
<p>that was killed in favor of buying a company called Skybox.</p>
<p>And Skybox was this coastal ventures-backed startup</p>
<p>that was trying to make a smaller scale startup.</p>
<p>And if you guys will remember around the early 2010s,</p>
<p>there were a bunch of startups that emerged</p>
<p>that were all about building small scale satellites</p>
<p>that could go up into low Earth orbit</p>
<p>and do things like imaging and communications.</p>
<p>And a bunch of these companies were banking on the fact</p>
<p>that the cost per kilogram to get your payload into space</p>
<p>was declining pretty precipitously.</p>
<p>So they were like, let&rsquo;s make super cheap commodity,</p>
<p>space imaging or space communication boxes,</p>
<p>put them in space.</p>
<p>And after a couple of years,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll fall out of orbit and burn up,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>If we can get enough use out of them</p>
<p>and they cost so little to put into space</p>
<p>and they cost a little to make,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s put hundreds of them up.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a company called Planet Labs</p>
<p>that does this that&rsquo;s, I think, going public via SPAC now.</p>
<p>Again, they&rsquo;ve been challenged</p>
<p>with building the business in imaging.</p>
<p>But there was a Google bought a company</p>
<p>for I think half a billion dollars called Skybox</p>
<p>trying to do this, which it was like imaging slash comms.</p>
<p>And they had a bigger refrigerator-sized box</p>
<p>that they were trying to put up.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Google spun that out to Planet Labs.</p>
<p>And the whole thing kind of became imaging.</p>
<p>But I just want to highlight</p>
<p>that this has been a big trend for a while.</p>
<p>And it speaks to the quality of Elon and his leadership.</p>
<p>Because the fact that this guy did what 20 other,</p>
<p>30 other people have tried,</p>
<p>companies have tried to do for the past decade or so.</p>
<p>And he said, you know what,</p>
<p>instead of just providing the infrastructure</p>
<p>to get all these devices into space,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just going to build the actual devices,</p>
<p>get this thing up and just go crazy with it</p>
<p>and put our capital into it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really impressive to see</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such a no brainer.</p>
<p>People have been talking about this opportunity</p>
<p>for over a decade.</p>
<p>And these guys just have absolutely rushed the field.</p>
<p>And they could build an incredible business out of this.</p>
<p>The two most important companies in satellite communications</p>
<p>are Starlink and Swarm.</p>
<p>And Swarm was a company that I seeded</p>
<p>and Saks did the Series A.</p>
<p>And if you talk to the founders of that company,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll give you this use case.</p>
<p>I think it was in 2014.</p>
<p>Do you guys remember there was like a Malaysian Airlines</p>
<p>flight that just disappeared?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Disappeared.</p>
<p>370.</p>
<p>Yeah, Malaysian Airlines flight 370.</p>
<p>And it was like 230, 240 people that passed away.</p>
<p>And the most, you know, indelible question</p>
<p>that I remember from this was we couldn&rsquo;t track it.</p>
<p>And I thought to myself, how is that even possible?</p>
<p>How do you lose a flight in the middle of the earth?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>It turns out it is because our internet coverage is so sad</p>
<p>that it only covers small areas.</p>
<p>And it made obvious that like, you know,</p>
<p>we should live in a world</p>
<p>where there is absolutely pervasive internet access</p>
<p>everywhere.</p>
<p>Every single little shred inch of the world</p>
<p>should be covered and saturated.</p>
<p>That should never happen.</p>
<p>You know, the people should be able to have closure.</p>
<p>They should be able to go and get that plane,</p>
<p>recover the bodies, give them proper funeral.</p>
<p>These are simple things, but they&rsquo;re human things</p>
<p>that we should be doing as human beings, right?</p>
<p>And just think about the IoT.</p>
<p>And internet access enables this.</p>
<p>And the idea that we can&rsquo;t do that is shocking.</p>
<p>And so I agree with you, Friedberg.</p>
<p>Elon&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And I think that within the next five years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll probably have pervasive internet access</p>
<p>everywhere in the earth.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s transformational.</p>
<p>You know, the second most valuable private company in space</p>
<p>is also a company that, you know,</p>
<p>I invested in, led the Series A called Relativity Space.</p>
<p>And their idea, which I think will help everybody</p>
<p>that wants to go to Mars and other places is,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we just 3D print the rockets?</p>
<p>And why don&rsquo;t we 3D print the engines?</p>
<p>And why don&rsquo;t we make that functionally useful?</p>
<p>Because it basically takes the cost of a rocket</p>
<p>and divides it by 10.</p>
<p>And these printers are small enough where, you know,</p>
<p>you can actually send them to and dismantle them</p>
<p>and take them with you to Mars and set them up there.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, you can print the parts</p>
<p>that you need to get back to earth, as an example.</p>
<p>So I think that additive manufacturing</p>
<p>has an enormous upside here in space.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s another area</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be really, really interesting.</p>
<p>Anybody read Andy Weir&rsquo;s Hail Mary yet?</p>
<p>The guy who did the Martian?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a science fiction author.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really great, because you don&rsquo;t actually know</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re going to find out there.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s one of the things that, you know,</p>
<p>to Friedberg&rsquo;s point, what do we find out there?</p>
<p>What if we find a compound out there</p>
<p>that like plutonium has some attributes</p>
<p>that we could leverage in very small amounts</p>
<p>to create unlimited energy</p>
<p>or unlimited prosperity in some ways?</p>
<p>There are things that can exist</p>
<p>that we have not been exposed to.</p>
<p>And of course, the probability is there are many things</p>
<p>that we have yet to be exposed to.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>Yeah, look, I don&rsquo;t subscribe to that thesis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you why.</p>
<p>And this maybe also speaks a little bit</p>
<p>to some of the counterpoints against the space industry</p>
<p>getting the attention and resourcing it has</p>
<p>relative to call it other places</p>
<p>to allocate capital and human resourcing.</p>
<p>And that is like the tools that we have</p>
<p>in science and engineering today as a species</p>
<p>continues to expand at kind of a geometric pace.</p>
<p>Our ability to convert any molecule</p>
<p>into any other molecule is basically fulfilled now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a function at this point</p>
<p>of how much energy and time it takes to do that work.</p>
<p>So almost all industry, the function of industry</p>
<p>is to convert molecules from one form to another.</p>
<p>And we have tools ranging from hardware engineering,</p>
<p>mechanical engineering,</p>
<p>and more recently in the early 20th century,</p>
<p>chemical engineering</p>
<p>and in the 21st century, biochemical engineering.</p>
<p>Those tools are allowing us to invent,</p>
<p>discover and convert molecules.</p>
<p>And even in some cases kind of elemental forms</p>
<p>that into nearly anything else we wanna produce.</p>
<p>And the technology is accelerating in such a way</p>
<p>the set of technologies compound</p>
<p>that if you think about 100 years from now,</p>
<p>200 years from now, 500 years from now,</p>
<p>the human species theoretically</p>
<p>for very minimal time and very minimal energy</p>
<p>should be able to have something that looks akin today</p>
<p>to the Star Trek replicator.</p>
<p>You basically type into a device what you&rsquo;d like to make</p>
<p>and it makes it for you in a few minutes.</p>
<p>And you could just like Mr. Fusion</p>
<p>and Back to the Future 2,</p>
<p>you could put any input you want into the thing,</p>
<p>you could throw in bananas and cans and whatever,</p>
<p>and outcomes this thing you wanna make.</p>
<p>So as the human species evolved towards that capability,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t need to get into the details,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just like the general trend line.</p>
<p>It becomes less relevant</p>
<p>that we need to go get other molecules</p>
<p>or go get other things from extra planetary sources.</p>
<p>The planet Earth has the order of 10 to the 23rd atoms,</p>
<p>two thirds of the surface is water.</p>
<p>There is so much that is like unexplored</p>
<p>and untapped from a resource perspective</p>
<p>within this spaceship that we&rsquo;re already on,</p>
<p>that the argument would be made</p>
<p>that our technology is allowing us</p>
<p>to effectively recreate all of our fantastic dreams</p>
<p>right here where we live today.</p>
<p>And first thing we&rsquo;re gonna have to do is fix this planet</p>
<p>and fix the ecosystems that are kind of at risk.</p>
<p>But as we progress and as these technologies progress,</p>
<p>we can do these extraordinary things</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t necessarily need to rely</p>
<p>on extra planetary travel and colonization</p>
<p>in order to achieve those objectives.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the optimistic counter argument.</p>
<p>Yeah, but we keep finding things</p>
<p>like these molecules in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, et cetera,</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t explain</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re finding those through telescopes,</p>
<p>let alone we get out there.</p>
<p>I mean, we might be able to create them, sure,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re gonna discover them in other places.</p>
<p>They may be beyond our human comprehension</p>
<p>that these things could even exist, David.</p>
<p>There are interesting things we&rsquo;re seeing there, for sure.</p>
<p>And I think, I think I mentioned this book before,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so esoteric and difficult,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s called Every Life is on Fire</p>
<p>by this guy named Jeremy England.</p>
<p>And he highlights how all of evolution</p>
<p>is effectively predicted by statistical physics.</p>
<p>And the energy bath and the molecules within a system</p>
<p>create a structure of molecules</p>
<p>that you wouldn&rsquo;t see except for that condition.</p>
<p>Meaning that over time,</p>
<p>the complexity of that system evolves</p>
<p>to create an equilibrium with the energy</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s covered in.</p>
<p>So what we see on planet Earth, he argues,</p>
<p>is organic molecules in what we call life,</p>
<p>which are these molecules</p>
<p>that are really good at copying themselves</p>
<p>to absorb energy and dissipate energy.</p>
<p>So the molecules and the energy state of Titan</p>
<p>is different than what we see at Earth.</p>
<p>So the way the molecules have evolved there</p>
<p>are so different than what we&rsquo;ve seen on Earth.</p>
<p>And you can see these incredible concepts</p>
<p>of what we wouldn&rsquo;t call life today,</p>
<p>but really could be defined as life there.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s certainly a lot to learn</p>
<p>and a lot to explore.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that we&rsquo;re limited</p>
<p>in terms of our ability to kind of realize those things</p>
<p>here on planet Earth.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>Like exploration is the core of being a human, right?</p>
<p>And for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Titan is one of the, it&rsquo;s the largest moon of Saturn.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s got its own really weird dense atmosphere</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s icy and slushy.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t even, we can&rsquo;t even comprehend</p>
<p>half the stuff going on there yet.</p>
<p>Would any of you guys take the Richard Branson trip?</p>
<p>Would you do the, you know, like next week or two years?</p>
<p>I guess at what point would you be comfortable</p>
<p>taking it?</p>
<p>Chamath, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re signed up.</p>
<p>I can answer for Sachs.</p>
<p>The answer&rsquo;s no.</p>
<p>600 and something, so.</p>
<p>How many flights more would you want to see?</p>
<p>You would want to do 10 more flights, 20 more flights?</p>
<p>No, I feel really confident that we know what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>This flight was so critical because it was about</p>
<p>figuring out what it was like to have passengers</p>
<p>in the back and how they&rsquo;d all behave</p>
<p>when you had multiple folks.</p>
<p>And I think once that readout is done</p>
<p>and Richard apparently took a bunch of notes.</p>
<p>So, you know, we&rsquo;ll be starting commercial ops,</p>
<p>I think, you know, the next two or three quarters.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, when you have Sachs.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, if I had a $500 million super yacht</p>
<p>like Jeff Bezos, that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;d be hanging out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be blasting.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be blasting myself into space.</p>
<p>But I mean, look, more power to them.</p>
<p>I mean, they got, you know, they certainly have got</p>
<p>gots.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s doing both.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Jekyll, would you do it?</p>
<p>You know, my theory is with kids,</p>
<p>I kind of think differently about it.</p>
<p>But if I was over 70, like Branson,</p>
<p>certainly I would do it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I would have to have that conversation</p>
<p>with my spouse and my kids and say,</p>
<p>you know, hey, this opportunity exists.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve done, let&rsquo;s call it 100 flights</p>
<p>somewhere in that neighborhood.</p>
<p>I would, I think I would feel pretty comfortable doing it,</p>
<p>but I would want to check in with my family and kids</p>
<p>and see if we were all in sync on taking that level.</p>
<p>I stopped riding motorcycles as an example.</p>
<p>I think that flying and space tourism</p>
<p>in the next year or two will be safer</p>
<p>than riding a motorcycle.</p>
<p>And then eventually it&rsquo;ll be safer than, you know,</p>
<p>driving a car or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite possible.</p>
<p>I was watching a space show with my daughter.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s three years old on the couch the other day.</p>
<p>And then she was like, oh, space, it looks so fun.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, yeah, I said, do you want to go to space?</p>
<p>And she said, she looked back at me and she said,</p>
<p>I want to go to space with you.</p>
<p>And it made me cry.</p>
<p>It was the first time I&rsquo;d ever thought like, man,</p>
<p>first time you&rsquo;d ever cried.</p>
<p>First time I ever cried.</p>
<p>Yeah, we just uploaded that to his firmware.</p>
<p>Yeah. Crying.</p>
<p>But I was like,</p>
<p>what are these water particles on my chin?</p>
<p>But I had like no desire,</p>
<p>I would say before she said that to go to space,</p>
<p>but it was a kind of a poignant moment that like,</p>
<p>man, this like moment of like inspiration</p>
<p>of like going to space is something that like,</p>
<p>I think is going to inspire, you know, a generation.</p>
<p>And I told my daughter, I said, you know,</p>
<p>you are going to go to space.</p>
<p>I hope I can be there with you.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Can I give you an idea?</p>
<p>Two different ideas, but they&rsquo;re roughly related.</p>
<p>When each of your kids turn 18,</p>
<p>buy them a ticket to space so that they become an astronaut,</p>
<p>which I think is like a beautiful kind of an idea where like,</p>
<p>you know, what an incredible present to give somebody</p>
<p>as they mature into age.</p>
<p>You know, if you, if you read, if you,</p>
<p>if you basically have heard all these astronauts have said,</p>
<p>you know, the overview effect,</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re above the earth looking down,</p>
<p>it has this completely transformational effect</p>
<p>on your outlook on life and the planet.</p>
<p>And so, you know, to the extent that that&rsquo;s a quantifiable</p>
<p>thing to give that to your child</p>
<p>seems like an enormous gift,</p>
<p>or when everybody&rsquo;s of age or whatever,</p>
<p>where all of you guys go as a family</p>
<p>so that the whole cabin is your family,</p>
<p>that would be really cool too.</p>
<p>Either of those ideas, I will do one of those too.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>Hold on a second, Shabbath.</p>
<p>There were four people, correct, in this flight,</p>
<p>if I remember correctly?</p>
<p>In this one, there&rsquo;s four passengers, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, wait a second.</p>
<p>There are four besties.</p>
<p>How are you not setting up a flight</p>
<p>for the hundredth episode of All In</p>
<p>to be on Virgin Galactic?</p>
<p>Can you imagine watching David cry and be so scared?</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>I can pretty much guarantee you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about sex, obviously.</p>
<p>You guys have to buy tickets,</p>
<p>but I can pretty much guarantee you</p>
<p>that if the three of you decided to buy tickets,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure I can organize</p>
<p>that we all go on the same flight.</p>
<p>That would be ratings bonanza.</p>
<p>That would be bigger than sex and COVID.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I need is to be entombed</p>
<p>with you guys for eternity.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know you want it.</p>
<p>You know you want it.</p>
<p>Hey, Shabbath, can you address</p>
<p>the von Karman line controversy around</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the right point to be in space?</p>
<p>Because it came up a lot this week in the news.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to kind of bring it up.</p>
<p>Came up by one person.</p>
<p>Well, no, no.</p>
<p>There was people talking about it on the news and stuff.</p>
<p>Like maybe you can just share for everyone.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was just Blue Origin being lame.</p>
<p>Honestly, that&rsquo;s so petty by Bezos.</p>
<p>Maybe just share what happened and kind of,</p>
<p>you know, the point of view on this.</p>
<p>Be awesome.</p>
<p>Basically, the question is what defines space, right?</p>
<p>So if you just like start from the bottom,</p>
<p>from ground level, right?</p>
<p>You have the troposphere, right?</p>
<p>So you have like the first kind of like 10,</p>
<p>20 kilometers or so, right?</p>
<p>Then you have the stratosphere, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where like a lot of like</p>
<p>weather balloon activity happens.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s at 50 kilometers.</p>
<p>Then you have the mesosphere, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll see things like meteors and stuff.</p>
<p>Then you get to basically the Karman line,</p>
<p>which is around, I don&rsquo;t know, 100 kilometers or so.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of countries that either have no opinion</p>
<p>or point to this kind of group</p>
<p>to define what the beginning of space is.</p>
<p>And they define that at about 100 clicks,</p>
<p>which is I want to say 62 miles, okay?</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the United States</p>
<p>and the DOD and NASA, et cetera.</p>
<p>And we define it at a different level, 50 odd miles.</p>
<p>And so in the United States,</p>
<p>you need to pass the US regulatory body&rsquo;s definition</p>
<p>of what the threshold of space is</p>
<p>to be considered an astronaut.</p>
<p>There is other countries that would then point</p>
<p>to a different line, the Karman line as the line.</p>
<p>I think the point is it&rsquo;s all much ado about nothing.</p>
<p>I think in the end, I think Virgin stated</p>
<p>that they went to 52 and a half or 53 and a half.</p>
<p>You know, things are iterative.</p>
<p>So over time, folks will get higher and higher.</p>
<p>But the point is, okay, and what?</p>
<p>You basically go into space, you get to see the planet,</p>
<p>you get to feel microgravity.</p>
<p>You know, you get the benefit of the overview effect,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re at 52 and a half,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing you&rsquo;ll get the same effect at 58 or 60 or 61.</p>
<p>And then you come back to earth.</p>
<p>So I thought it was kind of a little cheap and unnecessary.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s nothing experience wise that changes,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>I mean, like the-</p>
<p>Not to my understanding.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Blue Origin did a tweet,</p>
<p>from the beginning,</p>
<p>New Shepard was designed to fly above the Karman line.</p>
<p>So none of our astronauts would have an asterisk</p>
<p>next to their name.</p>
<p>For 96% of the world&rsquo;s population,</p>
<p>space begins 100 kilometers up and then it goes blah, blah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>why would they do that the days</p>
<p>before the Richard Branson goes up?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just totally classless.</p>
<p>It shows that Bezos has a competitive streak,</p>
<p>which is just not graceful,</p>
<p>I would say.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a little bit of bitterness there.</p>
<p>And then you look at Elon,</p>
<p>what did Elon do?</p>
<p>He went-</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so classy.</p>
<p>He went-</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so classy.</p>
<p>And he took a picture with Branson</p>
<p>and he went to support him and wrote a congratulatory tweet.</p>
<p>Elon does not feel he&rsquo;s in competition,</p>
<p>but for some reason Bezos,</p>
<p>you know Bezos had to like draft</p>
<p>and approve this specific tweet from Blue Origin.</p>
<p>And I just thought it was classless</p>
<p>and just stupid, Jeff, really.</p>
<p>Made you look so bad.</p>
<p>Elon was so fabulous.</p>
<p>I mean, it just shows you like what a class act he is</p>
<p>and what he cares about,</p>
<p>which is like he cares about advancing humans</p>
<p>and our ability to do things</p>
<p>that are incredible and inspiring.</p>
<p>And when other people do it,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not zero sum about it.</p>
<p>As you said, Jason, he was there,</p>
<p>he was supportive.</p>
<p>It was just lovely to see.</p>
<p>I think Bezos is still stung</p>
<p>for when Elon said he couldn&rsquo;t get it up.</p>
<p>Meaning he couldn&rsquo;t get his rocket into space, so.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if that was too classy of Elon.</p>
<p>Well, it was funny.</p>
<p>It was funny.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know if you guys have seen Jeff&rsquo;s rocket.</p>
<p>Kind of small.</p>
<p>His rocket is, I mean-</p>
<p>Jason, now you&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of tiny rocket.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just joking.</p>
<p>Just so we put a pin in it,</p>
<p>Melvin Capital, the people who went to war</p>
<p>with the Reddit traders or vice versa,</p>
<p>lost $5 billion.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t happen to a nicer group of people.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re down 46%,</p>
<p>which is just shocking in and of itself</p>
<p>in this kind of up market.</p>
<p>But then to actually quantify it,</p>
<p>they lost $5 billion fighting a bunch</p>
<p>of self-proclaimed Rs.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say the word</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want to get canceled,</p>
<p>but they call themselves Rs.</p>
<p>On reddit.</p>
<p>Redditors, redditors.</p>
<p>They cost them $5 billion.</p>
<p>Jason, you can say it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not calling them that,</p>
<p>they call themselves that.</p>
<p>They call themselves that, yes.</p>
<p>All right, listen, love you besties.</p>
<p>Sax, we&rsquo;re glad that you&rsquo;re safe and you&rsquo;re healthy.</p>
<p>No thanks to you.</p>
<p>No thanks to you.</p>
<p>No jokes.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t put any jokes in there.</p>
<p>I have so many jokes, I&rsquo;m going to save them.</p>
<p>I mean, honestly, my thought on your recovery</p>
<p>is no comment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just jealous you&rsquo;re going to lose</p>
<p>another five fricking pounds because of this.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I&rsquo;m down to 178, by the way.</p>
<p>Come on, stop.</p>
<p>Are you really?</p>
<p>Stop, you man of wrecks.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even break one.</p>
<p>When are you going to stop?</p>
<p>Was there a bet or no?</p>
<p>No bet.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to lose that bet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be like me playing sax and chess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not cool.</p>
<p>Jason, what are you tipping the scales at right now?</p>
<p>190, one.</p>
<p>190 and you&rsquo;re about to come to Italy</p>
<p>and basically you&rsquo;re going to gain 15 pounds for sure.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m doing one meal a day.</p>
<p>One meal a day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>One meal a day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m eating one meal a day.</p>
<p>How are you going to turn down the food?</p>
<p>But what if you eat for three hours in that one meal?</p>
<p>I just, I try everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just try.</p>
<p>And then I have discipline now.</p>
<p>Just like I stopped using Twitter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stopping Twitter.</p>
<p>Can I tell one funny story about J-Cal in Italy?</p>
<p>Talking about discipline.</p>
<p>Okay, so we were there in Italy.</p>
<p>When was this J-Cal, a few years ago, whatever?</p>
<p>This is a long time ago.</p>
<p>Is this when we were in Venice?</p>
<p>Yeah, you were with Jade and I was with Jacqueline.</p>
<p>That was a great story.</p>
<p>And we went to some ice cream place, right?</p>
<p>And so we all had these like ice cream,</p>
<p>gelato with like two scoops or whatever on there.</p>
<p>So Jason finishes his in like five seconds.</p>
<p>It was like, just disappeared.</p>
<p>And then he walks up to Jacqueline</p>
<p>and just goes like that.</p>
<p>And in one fell swoop,</p>
<p>he ate the gelato off her ice cream cone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>It was like a bulldog.</p>
<p>It was like a bulldog just eating your ice cream.</p>
<p>But how good was that fish that we got?</p>
<p>Remember that restaurant I found?</p>
<p>Yeah, the Dorad.</p>
<p>The Dorad, I mean, we still talk about that place.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was like one of the best meals we ever had.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been having a gelato, guys, every day.</p>
<p>Every day.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re so small.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I love about the Italians.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so small.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little, it&rsquo;s such a cute little-</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t feel like there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a lot of preservatives and stuff in there.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s just like butter and sugar, heavy cream.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, it&rsquo;s so good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so good.</p>
<p>How are the tomatoes right now?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to eat some tomatoes.</p>
<p>Oh, incredible, incredible.</p>
<p>I mean, I eat them, I bathe in them,</p>
<p>I rub them on my face.</p>
<p>You rub them all.</p>
<p>What about the mootz?</p>
<p>You got the mootz?</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s the burrata and the mootz?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>Oh, he&rsquo;s gonna gain 15 pounds.</p>
<p>100% he&rsquo;s gonna break.</p>
<p>Look at him.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>We should do a weigh-in when we get there</p>
<p>and a weigh-in at the end.</p>
<p>That would be the bet.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;re gonna turn down this food.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;re gonna say no to the pasta.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have pasta at lunch, pasta at dinner.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna go crazy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna just have two bites of everything.</p>
<p>Two bites of six different pastas, and I&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>And by the way, the best kept secret</p>
<p>is the quality of Italian white wine is outrageous.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s outrageous.</p>
<p>We should play some cards and drink some wine.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re gonna play, you know, for a couple days.</p>
<p>How many calories are in the white wine, Chamath?</p>
<p>Calories?</p>
<p>I mean, I have no idea.</p>
<p>But, you know, look, the thing in the summertime here</p>
<p>is you end up walking.</p>
<p>So I end up walking a lot or bicycling a little bit,</p>
<p>blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re burning through everything.</p>
<p>I gotta say, this e-bike I got, I got a rad power bike.</p>
<p>No, no, no, the whole point is to not have a motor</p>
<p>that powers it, you fucking lazy bastard.</p>
<p>No, no, what you don&rsquo;t understand is</p>
<p>because you have the motor in it, Chamath,</p>
<p>you ride your bike normal,</p>
<p>but then, like, let&rsquo;s say you do have dinner</p>
<p>or something like that, or you wanna go to dinner</p>
<p>10 miles away or 15 miles away,</p>
<p>you might not take your bike.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too long of a ride.</p>
<p>With these electric bikes,</p>
<p>instead of going 10 miles on the way there,</p>
<p>it takes your 10 mile ride and just puts you at 25,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re still burning the same number of calories.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like augmenting.</p>
<p>I really think that electric bikes are gonna change cities,</p>
<p>like, in a major way.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re already starting to in Europe and in China, but.</p>
<p>All right, everybody, we&rsquo;ll see you next time</p>
<p>on the All In podcast.</p>
<p>Love you, Sax.</p>
<p>Back at you.</p>
<p>Sax, I hope you get better.</p>
<p>Feel better. Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks, guys.</p>
<p>Yeah. I&rsquo;m better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m already better.</p>
<p>And wait, Friberg, you have nothing to say?</p>
<p>Computer.</p>
<p>It does not compute.</p>
<p>It is nice to see the three of you.</p>
<p>It was nice to check off the box</p>
<p>for my social interactions for the week.</p>
<p>I will now go back.</p>
<p>I have now done 75 minutes of social interaction,</p>
<p>powering down in three, two, one.</p>
<p>Mom, mom, mom, mom, mom.</p>
<p>See you next time.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Sax.</p>
<p>Uh-oh, I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>And it said, we open sourced it to the fans</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you, Westies.</p>
<p>The queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>That is my dog taking a notice in your driveway, Sax.</p>
<p>Wait, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>My avatar will meet me at Woodson.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room</p>
<p>and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension</p>
<p>that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>Let your beat be.</p>
<p>Let your beat be.</p>
<p>Let your beat be.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
