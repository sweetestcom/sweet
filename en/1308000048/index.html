    <p>Where were you on Thursday?</p>
<p>Were you in L.A.?</p>
<p>I was at home.</p>
<p>I got like a family to do.</p>
<p>Well, family, have you met him?</p>
<p>What were they like?</p>
<p>Are they everything you expected?</p>
<p>I had to meet the new kid.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s 19.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s his major?</p>
<p>Hey, everybody, welcome to another episode of the All In Podcast.</p>
<p>Yes, we made it to episode 47 in three episodes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be episode 50.</p>
<p>No plans to do anything other than just try to record this every week for you,</p>
<p>the loyal audience, with us again.</p>
<p>Coming off an amazing event, a live event on Monday, Tuesday,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know if it went into Wednesday, but David Freeberg&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>the production board event.</p>
<p>We recorded our first live All In.</p>
<p>It seems like it went well on an AV basis and the audience seemed to enjoy it.</p>
<p>What was the feedback, Freeberg?</p>
<p>So, you know, half the room were scientists and they&rsquo;d never heard of this podcast before,</p>
<p>and they were like, what the hell did we just show up to?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, who are these four guys on stage drinking this wine,</p>
<p>talking about politics for an hour and a half?</p>
<p>And dropping F-bombs.</p>
<p>And dropping F-bombs.</p>
<p>And there was a little bit of kind of seasoning we had to do afterwards</p>
<p>to get everyone kind of comfortable.</p>
<p>But actually, it was fantastic.</p>
<p>People loved it.</p>
<p>You guys were the highlight.</p>
<p>And I thought it was super fun to do that in person.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you guys thought.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool energy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super cool.</p>
<p>It was great.</p>
<p>And with us again, of course, David Sachs, the rain man himself,</p>
<p>and the dictator Chamath Palihapitiya.</p>
<p>What did you think, Sachs, of the live event format?</p>
<p>Obviously, half the audience were fans of the show, half weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Which is better than putting people randomly into it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m glad that the people who are not fans of,</p>
<p>or have never heard of the show, didn&rsquo;t walk out.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have walkouts, so that was good.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, look, we were slightly more palatable to them</p>
<p>than Andrew Dice Clay or something like that.</p>
<p>But&hellip;</p>
<p>Welcome to the production board!</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ve got to run for you!</p>
<p>It was a good change of&hellip;</p>
<p>Hickory dickory dock!</p>
<p>The production board!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to start at Jack and Jill, when I smell something,</p>
<p>you think Sachs farted!</p>
<p>It was a good change of pace.</p>
<p>I mean, I think some people commented that the lighting,</p>
<p>the production values weren&rsquo;t that great.</p>
<p>They seemed fine to us at the time.</p>
<p>But, so we&rsquo;re going to have to do better on that next time.</p>
<p>And other people speculated that we took,</p>
<p>we were easier on each other in terms of debating topics,</p>
<p>because we were in person.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t feel that while sitting there,</p>
<p>but you guys tell me if you think that was true.</p>
<p>I thought we got a better read on each other in person,</p>
<p>and we had more dialogue than we normally would over a Zoom.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys felt the same.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>And then I kind of liked the evening podcast, The Glass of Wine.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something about it, like you&rsquo;re just like a little&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re coming in for a landing.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re coming in for a nice evening.</p>
<p>The pay little cards after.</p>
<p>It could be a thing.</p>
<p>It could definitely be a thing.</p>
<p>I could definitely make Harlan 2012 a regular part of taping this pod.</p>
<p>The problem is we taped too early on a Friday, right?</p>
<p>If we could change the taping to like happy hour or something like that,</p>
<p>it might work better.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Harlan 2012.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good bottle of wine?</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Even J-Cal knows that.</p>
<p>Look at him pretending.</p>
<p>I know that one.</p>
<p>Pretending to be a man of the people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the one with the round label.</p>
<p>I know it.</p>
<p>I know. I&rsquo;m looking at it right now.</p>
<p>Oh my Lord.</p>
<p>Some of those go up in value.</p>
<p>Those things look like as high as $75.</p>
<p>Do you guys think we could do a pod where we like record after playing poker for two hours?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re two hours into the wine and poker and then you record?</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be too&hellip;</p>
<p>I think the wine yes, poker no.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think for a first time, the audio was great.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, you know, job one is to get the audio great because 99% of consumption happens that way.</p>
<p>To do it right.</p>
<p>I like the line of light in Friedberg&rsquo;s face for the first 45 minutes of the pod.</p>
<p>For all commentators.</p>
<p>You know, it was my wife who actually got up and fixed that like no one else of the crew,</p>
<p>you know, the dozens of people working there did anything about it.</p>
<p>My wife stood up and fixed the curtain.</p>
<p>Dude, without Al, you would be nowhere.</p>
<p>Be nowhere in life.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a great person.</p>
<p>What was the empty seat about between me and Chamath?</p>
<p>I mean, there was an empty&hellip;</p>
<p>That was if we wanted to bring up a guest.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all the people&rsquo;s names that were written on that piece of paper are</p>
<p>besties did not show up on time.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>No Bill Gurley, Sky Dayton didn&rsquo;t come in.</p>
<p>They all showed up at like nine o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>Yeah, there may be a reason for that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I heard that actually was the back channel.</p>
<p>Sky Dayton.</p>
<p>The back channel was Sky Dayton and somebody else waited outside because they knew they</p>
<p>might get pulled up.</p>
<p>I got that from&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have to beep his name out.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s your first time saying his name on the&hellip;</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s not gonna want his name mentioned on this pod.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been on my pod.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been on This Week in Star Wars.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the first 10 guests.</p>
<p>That was the last press appearance he did was 11 years ago.</p>
<p>He literally does not&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, everybody knows who Sky Dayton is.</p>
<p>Earthling founder, Boingo founder.</p>
<p>Everybody of our generation, but it&rsquo;s amazing how quickly the tech crowd moves on.</p>
<p>So true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a famous story actually when Mark Andreessen met Mark Zuckerberg for the first</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg didn&rsquo;t know that Andreessen had created Netscape.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even sure he knew what Netscape was.</p>
<p>I think he said something like, I created Mosaic.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Oh, right, right.</p>
<p>Mosaic.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, yeah, look, in the tech industry, we&rsquo;re all concerned about the future.</p>
<p>No one pays a lot of attention to history.</p>
<p>Do you guys feel like last generation&rsquo;s entrepreneurs and investors at this point?</p>
<p>Well, some of us are still currently creating things, Freebird.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t mention the name of the app as per&hellip;</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Anti-promotion rules.</p>
<p>But I have recently launched a new product.</p>
<p>You could download my app.</p>
<p>Redacted.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s not a lot of kind of long careers in Silicon Valley, right?</p>
<p>A lot of people kind of have&hellip;</p>
<p>Of creating products?</p>
<p>Well, if you have asymmetric success, right, you have these kind of like big bursts.</p>
<p>And then, you know, it&rsquo;s a different kind of life.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t go kind of push again for the next hard entrepreneurial project.</p>
<p>Typically, not everyone, obviously.</p>
<p>And then you end up seeing like a generation kind of die out.</p>
<p>Like, you know, Web 1.0 and Web 2.0.</p>
<p>And then, you know, you don&rsquo;t see them again.</p>
<p>You also see the adventure, right?</p>
<p>80% of them.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of truth to that, that&hellip;</p>
<p>And I worry about this with my own kids, that I think deprivation creates motivation.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Especially to do something as hard as create a company, create a startup.</p>
<p>Deprivation creates motivation.</p>
<p>Welcome to David Sachs&rsquo; infomercial.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I think&hellip;</p>
<p>Thank you for coming to my tent.</p>
<p>That leads to fornication.</p>
<p>You know, beep, beep, beep.</p>
<p>Our friend beep.</p>
<p>Has a saying that sort of became famous when Elon then repeated it,</p>
<p>which is that creating a startup is like staring into the abyss and eating glass.</p>
<p>And it is really hard to create these companies when they&rsquo;re successful.</p>
<p>And so, not a lot of people want to do it again once they&rsquo;ve reached that point.</p>
<p>And it does take a certain amount of, like I said, deprivation to do this.</p>
<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>Which is why giving everybody the participation trophy and</p>
<p>trying to make people&rsquo;s lives as easy as possible.</p>
<p>I mean, yes, you don&rsquo;t want to deprive people on the one hand,</p>
<p>but on the other hand, it does often lead to good things.</p>
<p>Totally agree.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing a bit of a dry run of this.</p>
<p>If people believe that they have UBI or the government&rsquo;s going to take care of them,</p>
<p>I would be fine with UBI, you know, everybody getting a little bit of money.</p>
<p>And if it was a safety net, the only thing I worry about is it seems like a little bit of</p>
<p>money if you&rsquo;re clever means you could never work.</p>
<p>And then what happens to those people in society, right?</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s anti-compassionate because what you do is you kick out the</p>
<p>bottom rungs of the ladder of economic success when you basically pay able-bodied people not</p>
<p>to work.</p>
<p>I mean, those entry-level jobs that may not pay much better than the UBI are an important</p>
<p>stepping stone to where they get to next in their career.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s demotivating.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already seen in California, we&rsquo;ve been doing this.</p>
<p>UBI is not going to pay you to go to college, but Amazon will, as an example.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the GI Bill.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s all kinds of examples where in history we&rsquo;ve used, you know,</p>
<p>entry-level jobs as exactly as they&rsquo;re meant to be, an entry-level opportunity,</p>
<p>an on-ramp to work your ass off and to make something of yourself.</p>
<p>If you all of a sudden let people opt out of it, then it&rsquo;s going to be a very ‚Äì what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not going to realize is by the time they get old enough where they will want to</p>
<p>have some kind of purpose, it&rsquo;ll be too late.</p>
<p>Because in activating yourself in your 40s and 50s to essentially start your life is</p>
<p>really hard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you an example of this.</p>
<p>Like, you know, right now I ‚Äì you know, I would say I&rsquo;m like fairly fluent in Italian.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty impressive.</p>
<p>But I started taking Italian lessons and, you know, the last four or five percent of</p>
<p>a language is brutalizing, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s every little grammatical thing.</p>
<p>You want to get it completely right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very demotivating for me sometimes because I&rsquo;m like, God, why the fuck am I</p>
<p>doing this?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>I can get it by.</p>
<p>I just speak it.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve made a commitment to myself.</p>
<p>Same thing in biotech, you know.</p>
<p>I got introduced to it by Friedberg and obviously Nat and now I&rsquo;m trying to learn.</p>
<p>And it is a grind.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s so easy to quit.</p>
<p>Now, you take that to the extreme and some random person that doesn&rsquo;t have necessarily</p>
<p>the ability to fall back on the success that, you know, we&rsquo;ve all collectively had and</p>
<p>you have to start from scratch.</p>
<p>My God, it&rsquo;s really tough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really tough.</p>
<p>At our age, it is just hard.</p>
<p>Kids are screaming in the background.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to manage all this stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s easier when you&rsquo;re in your early 20s?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Be careful what you wish for.</p>
<p>But why is it easier when you&rsquo;re in your early 20s?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it always a grind to learn something and push yourself to develop yourself?</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>Well, you have nothing.</p>
<p>So the theory is you have some motivation to get something, right?</p>
<p>But if you still have nothing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to climb up the mountain because like staying at the shore means you can go</p>
<p>watch out to sea or something.</p>
<p>I spent hours and hours and hours working.</p>
<p>Hours and hours and hours.</p>
<p>My 20s and 30s, like it was like 10 to 16 hour days.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t leave the office.</p>
<p>Is that different today?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t work in the same way I did before because I&rsquo;m trying to do a different job.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve earned the right and I now put myself under pressure to do it differently because</p>
<p>I have a different job to do.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But when I was in my 20s and I was a PM, you know, grinding out a product or, you know,</p>
<p>writing a feature spec or, you know, building a model and trying to put all these things</p>
<p>together, it was so much thankless work.</p>
<p>I learned a ton and it was all worth it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I was about to ask you, do you regret it or not?</p>
<p>No, look, this is the thing about work.</p>
<p>This is the thing about work life balance that the people are always complaining about</p>
<p>people who are working too hard don&rsquo;t realize is that, yeah, you want to think about work</p>
<p>life balance, but across your entire life.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the things you&rsquo;ll do in your 20s is work much harder to set yourself up</p>
<p>to where you want to be in your 50s.</p>
<p>And so Chamath doesn&rsquo;t have to work as hard in his 50s because he worked much harder earlier</p>
<p>in his life.</p>
<p>And now he&rsquo;s got the skill set where he can delegate more.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I think we&rsquo;re, you know, we really shortchange people when we tell them as young</p>
<p>people that they don&rsquo;t need to work hard or in the extreme case of UBI that we&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>paying people not to work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not developing the right habits that are going to make them successful later on.</p>
<p>And in fairness, though, if you look at minimum wage and you look at entry level jobs, many</p>
<p>of them paid too little.</p>
<p>Historically, these companies like McDonald&rsquo;s, I know it&rsquo;s a free market, but we&rsquo;re paying</p>
<p>very little.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking $70 an hour and no benefits.</p>
<p>And, you know, this is kind of unnecessary greed in my mind.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what my first job was at Burger King.</p>
<p>I made $4.55 an hour.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I made $4.25 an hour in 1996.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my first job cleaning, cleaning a pool.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>$2.50 for me when I worked at Fordham&rsquo;s computer center.</p>
<p>I think it was $3 it had gone to.</p>
<p>But when I started in the workforce in 88, it was $2.50 was the minimum wage.</p>
<p>What was the minimum wage where you were, David?</p>
<p>What was it like in that 19th century?</p>
<p>It sucks.</p>
<p>Yeah, tell us.</p>
<p>When I was working at ‚Äì</p>
<p>When you killed the fields.</p>
<p>No, I remember when I was in college, I worked at a bar.</p>
<p>And I mean, I was there drinking so much.</p>
<p>I finally was like, why don&rsquo;t you just give me a job?</p>
<p>So I might as well make some money while I&rsquo;m sitting here.</p>
<p>And they paid me $7 an hour.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I did my senior year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Pretty good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty well-paying job.</p>
<p>$7 an hour.</p>
<p>One of the other problems ‚Äì</p>
<p>But one of the other problems of UBI that Larry Summers has been ‚Äì</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the former US Secretary of Treasury.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been on the record about is the inflationary effect.</p>
<p>So there are pretty smart economists like himself who highlight that as you give people,</p>
<p>everyone, $10,000 a year, first of all, it&rsquo;s going to cost $10 trillion or whatever the estimate is</p>
<p>to fund that sort of program.</p>
<p>And suddenly, the cost of a burger goes from $0.49 to $0.99 or $0.99 to $1.99</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s much greater demand on that area of the economy for consumption.</p>
<p>And so you see an inflationary effect, which trickles its way through.</p>
<p>And so what ends up happening ultimately is by pumping more of that money in for free,</p>
<p>without productivity coming out of it, you effectively see inflation.</p>
<p>And so it wipes itself out.</p>
<p>And so this is kind of one economic theory on UBI is that it can actually</p>
<p>just end up being within 10 years, completely useless and pointless,</p>
<p>because then the basic cost of living climbs so much</p>
<p>that you need to raise the UBI again to give people basic living expenses.</p>
<p>And so it becomes this kind of nasty runaway effect.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not really sustainable is one argument that&rsquo;s made against UBI.</p>
<p>But obviously, a different point than what we were kind of saying a moment ago.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think people, I think people don&rsquo;t know what they want.</p>
<p>And if they get it, they&rsquo;re going to.</p>
<p>I think of look, a form of a form of UBI does make sense.</p>
<p>And I do think we need to subsidize folks.</p>
<p>But you know, I think maybe it&rsquo;s probably just a fancier word for welfare.</p>
<p>I grew up on welfare.</p>
<p>And I can tell you that I don&rsquo;t think our family benefited from it.</p>
<p>Psychologically, we benefited from it socioeconomically, because we needed it to not</p>
<p>starve.</p>
<p>But the knock on effects of, you know, when you&rsquo;re in that loop of, again, being in your</p>
<p>30s, 40s and 50s, not finding purpose, you know, which my parents had to struggle through.</p>
<p>Coping, you cope with alcohol, you cope with depression,</p>
<p>the knock on effects your kids, I don&rsquo;t think we want to see that.</p>
<p>And so when people think about UBI, I think they need to understand that,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;ve run a long experiment.</p>
<p>In this thing called welfare, you know, what welfare does.</p>
<p>A lot of us have felt it.</p>
<p>And there needs to be a better way.</p>
<p>Because if you just let people opt out, I don&rsquo;t think you really understand what</p>
<p>happens over long durations of time when you&rsquo;re not doing anything.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s getting really weird right now, right?</p>
<p>I mean, the fact that restaurants are closing that have customers, but they can&rsquo;t operate.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re starting to actually see the effect of it.</p>
<p>You know, in some service.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the open job stat right now?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 9 million open jobs in the US.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been bouncing from 8 to 10 million.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more unfilled jobs and there are unemployed people, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or unemployment is high, but unfilled jobs is even higher.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve somehow moved away from a political consensus we had in the 1990s that I think</p>
<p>made a lot of sense when Bill Clinton passed welfare reform with, you know,</p>
<p>a lot of Republican support is, look, we need to have a welfare system.</p>
<p>We need to take care of people who either can&rsquo;t work or can&rsquo;t find a job for a good reason.</p>
<p>There needs to be a social safety net.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re an able-bodied person who can find a job, you should be working.</p>
<p>And that welfare reform they passed in the 90s did lead to a lot of people finding meaningful work,</p>
<p>which I think resulted in happier lives.</p>
<p>And somehow we&rsquo;ve moved off that political consensus that everyone kind of agrees.</p>
<p>Yes, social safety net, but able-bodied people should work to now we have this elite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really an elite ideology of UBI, which is, look, we&rsquo;re going to pay people</p>
<p>not to work, which I just think is sort of like un-American.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it also like a little insulting being like, you know what?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t even bother working.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making too little money.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll just give you money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>It feels insulting to people&rsquo;s dignity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest.</p>
<p>Like I wouldn&rsquo;t want to take it.</p>
<p>I would rather go out and be, I was a waiter or bus boy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go be a waiter or bus boy and make enough money to pay my rent.</p>
<p>And yeah, one of the things you want it for free.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>One of the things you hear is, well, your job&rsquo;s going to be replaced by a machine anyway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not productive work.</p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t we just pay you to sit back and, you know, take yourself out of the economy?</p>
<p>Well, I, like you said, the unfilled jobs number shows that even with all the automation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening in the economy, and that&rsquo;s a trend that will continue.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a need for, you know, human labor.</p>
<p>And I think there always will be.</p>
<p>And, and it&rsquo;s a little bit too soon to be throwing in the towel on the idea that entire</p>
<p>groups of people can&rsquo;t productively work.</p>
<p>Does everybody believe able-bodied people should work and not get free money?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that it should or shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think the question is what&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s in folks&rsquo; best interests?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what I mean.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But yeah.</p>
<p>So is it in best people&rsquo;s best interest?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll phrase it the way you&rsquo;re saying it is in people&rsquo;s best interest.</p>
<p>I think the, I think the point where we&rsquo;re going to go wrong is when we couple UBI with</p>
<p>actually having to work or not work.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the right idea.</p>
<p>I think we have to do a decent job of letting people find the things that they want to work</p>
<p>on, because everybody can find something that they want to work on.</p>
<p>And that shouldn&rsquo;t exclude you or disqualify you from getting UBI so that all that does</p>
<p>is then just raise the general standard of living.</p>
<p>I think that idea is better.</p>
<p>The problem is when we talk about UBI, what we are talking about it is in the exact way,</p>
<p>Jason, that you said, which is letting people opt out.</p>
<p>I mean, think about how privileged that is to, there are places in the world where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not enough jobs and people are like, wait a second, an American has to be fulfilled</p>
<p>with their job selection in addition to getting a job.</p>
<p>That just seems like the height of entitlements.</p>
<p>Like sometimes you just need a job because you need money to pay your bills, right?</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying if you get product, if you get job, job candidate, you know, citizen</p>
<p>fit, the uptick will be better.</p>
<p>UBI is a benefit.</p>
<p>The uptick will be better.</p>
<p>UBI is a benefit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like universal healthcare.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t make a decision about universal healthcare based on who does or does not have a job.</p>
<p>And so UBI should basically be about evening, you know, the bottom few rungs of economic</p>
<p>viability so that everybody has a reasonable ability to have a decent life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a nice idea.</p>
<p>I think that makes a ton of sense.</p>
<p>But coupling it to having to work or not work, where some people say, oh, great, I can take</p>
<p>this money and not work is the wrong way to figure this out.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re talking politics, why don&rsquo;t we shift to the recall?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So postmortem on the Newsom recall.</p>
<p>Secretary of State says the recall cost over $300 million, obviously.</p>
<p>Gavin Newsom won in a bit of a landslide.</p>
<p>Hold on, the $300 million point.</p>
<p>Let me just take care of this real quick, okay?</p>
<p>Because I saw this all day on social media.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Yeah, it did cost $300 million.</p>
<p>But all the people crying about that, clutching their pearls about the $300 million, never</p>
<p>said a word about the $30 billion, the 100 times greater EDD fraud that was perpetrated</p>
<p>by our state and by our one-party rule of the state.</p>
<p>And the recall process and the ballot initiative process is the only check we have on elected</p>
<p>leadership in a one-party state.</p>
<p>So listen, I&rsquo;ll start clutching my pearls about the $300 million when they start talking</p>
<p>about the $30 billion.</p>
<p>But look, let&rsquo;s shift to the result of this.</p>
<p>What are you referring to?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I know enough about the $30 billion EDD fraud.</p>
<p>This is the EDD fraud where $30 billion basically went to anyone claiming unemployment insurance</p>
<p>and $30 billion in fake claims were paid out.</p>
<p>The process was poorly administered.</p>
<p>So, I mean, people were just creating fake addresses.</p>
<p>They were just sending in claims from anywhere and $30 billion went out.</p>
<p>So look, I mean, that&rsquo;s the kind of incompetence and corruption that we have in California.</p>
<p>So Zach, your point is that because it&rsquo;s a single-party state where the Democrats have</p>
<p>supermajority in the assembly and obviously have the governorship, that the only mechanism</p>
<p>for the minority, the Republican Party, is to kind of run recall.</p>
<p>Not even the Republicans, just us as citizens.</p>
<p>I mean, look, let&rsquo;s remember how the recall and the ballot initiative came to be, that</p>
<p>process.</p>
<p>It actually came from progressives early in the 20th century who said, we need the people</p>
<p>to have some direct democracy because special interests might usurp the electoral process</p>
<p>and get control over all these elected representatives.</p>
<p>And frankly, that&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s happened in the state of California.</p>
<p>But the people who have that power are progressives and so they want to amend or abolish the recall</p>
<p>process.</p>
<p>So look, I think $300 million once every 20 years to put the fear of God into politicians</p>
<p>is money well spent in my view, even if this particular recall wasn&rsquo;t close.</p>
<p>There are much greater examples of waste, fraud, and abuse that the people complaining</p>
<p>about this should be wanting to tackle.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll believe them about the $300 million when they complain about the $30 billion.</p>
<p>But look, this was a total shellacking for supporters of the recall.</p>
<p>And I do think that whenever you suffer a defeat, I think it&rsquo;s important for you to</p>
<p>think about what went wrong, you know, and certainly as a supporter of the recall, I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s worth doing a postmortem.</p>
<p>I think, you know, any political party when it loses needs to do some introspection.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>So what went wrong?</p>
<p>Well, I think a couple of things.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So if you go back to the polls a month ago or so, it was a dead heat.</p>
<p>We even had that shock poll that Newsom was down by 10.</p>
<p>And then what happened?</p>
<p>Well, the Republican Party basically consolidated their support around Larry Elder.</p>
<p>Prior to that, you kind of had this amorphous blob of five different candidates who didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a lot of name recognition.</p>
<p>They were pretty moderate.</p>
<p>They were a hard target for Newsom to shoot at.</p>
<p>Once the Republican Party consolidated around Elder, it provided a very convenient and rich</p>
<p>target for Newsom to shoot at.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;d have to say that tactically, the Republican Party made a mistake there.</p>
<p>Now, I understand why they did it.</p>
<p>I mean, Elder is smart.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s charismatic.</p>
<p>He appeals to that base.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s not the moderate candidate that like a Schwarzenegger was or that I, you know,</p>
<p>Chamath, I wanted you to run.</p>
<p>And so Falconer was sort of that candidate.</p>
<p>And so you kind of had a choice on the Republican side between a moderate candidate who wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>very charismatic, which was Falconer, and a very charismatic candidate who wasn&rsquo;t moderate.</p>
<p>And it really played into Newsom&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>And he was then able to nationalize the election in the wake of that.</p>
<p>So he branded, I think somewhat unfairly, he branded Elder as a Trumper.</p>
<p>And he ran against Trumpism.</p>
<p>And even Biden came to California to denounce Elder as a Trump clone, which, look, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of things you may not like about Larry Elder.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to call him a Trump clone.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what they did.</p>
<p>And so they demonized him.</p>
<p>And so if you look at the issues that Newsom ran on, they were all national issues.</p>
<p>He was, you know, talking about what was happening in Texas with abortion.</p>
<p>And he talked about COVID.</p>
<p>We should come back to that one because I think that is a state issue, too.</p>
<p>We should talk about it.</p>
<p>But he started talking about issues that were really more national issues.</p>
<p>And so the recall moved away from the issues that had galvanized supporters in the polls</p>
<p>polls just one month ago, which were homelessness, crime, schools and school closures and lockdowns.</p>
<p>And Newsom was able to very effectively change the subject.</p>
<p>Well, he got everybody back to school, right?</p>
<p>If people didn&rsquo;t go back to school, it could have been a different result.</p>
<p>I think the recall is very helpful in that.</p>
<p>And if you remember,</p>
<p>Do you think policy has shifted because of the recall sacks at this point?</p>
<p>And doesn&rsquo;t that ultimately kind of benefit the issues you were most kind of concerned about?</p>
<p>Look, the 300 million was worth it just to get businesses open and just to send a message to the</p>
<p>education unions that they could not keep schools closed for another year.</p>
<p>I, you know, if you look at when Newsom relaxed the lockdowns, it was at every</p>
<p>step of the recall process.</p>
<p>When the recall finally got enough signatures to get put over the top,</p>
<p>he all of a sudden started liberalizing the lockdowns.</p>
<p>He knew they were very unpopular and he gave up on that issue.</p>
<p>And he got the education unions to stand down on the issue of school reopenings,</p>
<p>I think because he was facing this recall.</p>
<p>So, look, I think the recall was worth it just for that.</p>
<p>But do you think things could have been different if there was a fringe candidate?</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know, a Sri Lankan billionaire that was, you know,</p>
<p>not kind of this hardened Republican that they could charge him?</p>
<p>Yes, I blame Chamath for this.</p>
<p>I think a candidate like Chamath could have won.</p>
<p>OK, a Democratic centrist.</p>
<p>Obviously, I&rsquo;m joking.</p>
<p>Bloomberg.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t blame you, Chamath.</p>
<p>I understand why you wouldn&rsquo;t want to run.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m saying a candidate like Chamath,</p>
<p>which is who I supported, or a candidate like Schwarzenegger.</p>
<p>Remember, Schwarzenegger, when he ran in the early 2000s,</p>
<p>he was pro-choice and pro-gay marriage at a time that gay marriage was not very popular.</p>
<p>He was socially very liberal.</p>
<p>You have to take those issues off the table because California is not going to vote.</p>
<p>He was pro-life candidate.</p>
<p>I think he was pro-gay marriage before the Clintons.</p>
<p>Yes, he was very early on that.</p>
<p>He was socially very liberal and very tolerant.</p>
<p>And you got to be in California.</p>
<p>In general, do you think the unions in California,</p>
<p>which is an issue that&rsquo;s been talked about a lot on this pod, have been weakened</p>
<p>because of the recall and the voice that rose up during this period of time?</p>
<p>Or do you think nothing&rsquo;s really changed long term?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a long-term project to get the public to see</p>
<p>that the education unions are like any special interest,</p>
<p>which is that they will pursue their interest at the expense of the general interest.</p>
<p>And they have to be controlled.</p>
<p>Again, like any special interest.</p>
<p>I think because teachers are rightfully very popular,</p>
<p>people haven&rsquo;t realized what the union bosses are up to.</p>
<p>I think that that has been exposed because of COVID and the school closures</p>
<p>to a much, much greater degree.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, if you look at the recalls happening locally, too,</p>
<p>with Chesa Boone and the San Francisco School Board,</p>
<p>it seems like now the citizenship is saying, oh, we do have a recourse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called doing a recall and stating our opinion very strongly</p>
<p>and then attempting to removing people.</p>
<p>And yeah, I think that does change people&rsquo;s behavior.</p>
<p>You can be sure Chesa Boone is thinking about outcomes a little bit more now.</p>
<p>The implications of this recall, I think, are really important.</p>
<p>And I think it plays out in who runs in two years when Newsom is up for reelection.</p>
<p>And absolutely, it&rsquo;ll change who runs on the Democratic side in four years,</p>
<p>assuming Newsom wins.</p>
<p>You have to remember, there have been a massive degradation in the quality of life.</p>
<p>The most populous state in America, which represents the fifth largest economy in the world,</p>
<p>under one party control.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So there is not a single law that cannot be passed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a single program that cannot be implemented.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a single idea that can&rsquo;t be pursued.</p>
<p>Yet we have had an absolute decline in quality of life under that rubric.</p>
<p>And so when people really come to terms with that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, I think, when there&rsquo;s a sea change.</p>
<p>And I hope the sea change is not necessarily a Democrat or Republican thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s back to centrism.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s checking special interests, exactly what Sachs says,</p>
<p>and realizing that just because you use a different name, like union or something else,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still a special interest.</p>
<p>And you need to actually be focused on the interests of the general public,</p>
<p>our kids, the environment, water quality.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t walk into a state where everybody up and now the ticket is on your</p>
<p>same team and get shit done, it&rsquo;s a really tough report card.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m just super uninspired by these guys.</p>
<p>Like, where is their audacious plan for California?</p>
<p>Has anybody stated like an audacious like, here&rsquo;s what this state?</p>
<p>No, I mean, no.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>We could be the best economy with the greatest education system.</p>
<p>And we can build a million units of housing.</p>
<p>Should that be the role of the state government?</p>
<p>I mean, like, you know, should or should the competition,</p>
<p>they are they&rsquo;re in competition with with Florida and Texas,</p>
<p>they have to compete for business and citizens.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s not done at the state level, we&rsquo;re going to have to rely on the federal level.</p>
<p>And we know that that doesn&rsquo;t work because we have 50 states that are</p>
<p>increasingly more diverse every day.</p>
<p>So the whole idea with the Constitution and the Founding Fathers was like,</p>
<p>we have this incredible startup.</p>
<p>But over time, I think we&rsquo;ve decided that, you know,</p>
<p>this startup is an umbrella organization of 50 other startups.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a holding company.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;ll be these small little, you know,</p>
<p>rules and differences amongst these 50 states.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;ll allow us collectively to thrive.</p>
<p>So sexy, put out a tweet.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry, go ahead.</p>
<p>No, I just want to I think we want to believe in that idea.</p>
<p>Like, there is no savior.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no savior for 350 people.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s barely a savior for the 60 million people in California.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not going to happen by just throwing your hands up in the air and expecting some</p>
<p>president to come around because that&rsquo;s just too hard.</p>
<p>Each state has to act like the citizens and be,</p>
<p>you know, just rugged individualists who are self sustaining and resourceful.</p>
<p>And this state is not self sustaining, resourceful or ambitious.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s falling behind Texas and Florida and other competitors.</p>
<p>So you put out a tweet saying Austin or Miami, are you</p>
<p>are you in the active transition phase or where are you at?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>I think the trend line in California is not good.</p>
<p>I think what you&rsquo;ve already seen in the days since the recall is that</p>
<p>Gavin Newsom has now laid out the strategy for all progressives</p>
<p>in like even from San Francisco to anywhere in the country of how they&rsquo;re going to run.</p>
<p>And what they&rsquo;re going to do is this, that no matter</p>
<p>how bad things get in terms of crime, in terms of homelessness,</p>
<p>in terms of quality of schools in cities and states that they have complete control over,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re always going to campaign against Trump and Trumpism.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going to demonize and otherize whoever the candidate is on the other side</p>
<p>as a Trumpist, whether they are or not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be the playbook from now on.</p>
<p>And this is where I think the attacks against</p>
<p>Larry Elder were very unfair is before he even had a chance to define what he was about.</p>
<p>You have publications like the L.A. Times calling him the new face of white supremacy.</p>
<p>I mean, it was like unbelievable, but.</p>
<p>Black Klansman.</p>
<p>Yeah, they basically try to make him out to be a black, which look, he is not OK.</p>
<p>Larry Elder is a libertarian.</p>
<p>Maybe his politics are not in the mainstream in California, but he&rsquo;s not a black Klansman.</p>
<p>But look, this is what the progressive playbook is going to be for the next two decades, which is</p>
<p>to demonize anybody who stands up to them as basically being a Trumpist.</p>
<p>And the irony of it will be that they will have total control over the problems that</p>
<p>people really care about, crime, schools, homelessness.</p>
<p>And somehow, you know, what Newsom proved is that you can whip people up into, you can stir</p>
<p>their partisan political tribalism when you do that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s effective is he gets people to see blue and</p>
<p>and he gets a free pass on these issues that just a month ago, people were very dissatisfied with.</p>
<p>Now, I do think it&rsquo;s very, very important that our Republican Party</p>
<p>not play into this.</p>
<p>And there was a very good editorial.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s too much to say.</p>
<p>How come the Republicans are still pursuing a Trumpian, you know, framework?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re screwing up.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re stupid.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>Look, they&rsquo;re so dumb.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really stupid strategy.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s two things they got to fix right away.</p>
<p>OK, so number one, Rich Lowry from National Review had a police, a piece in Politico where</p>
<p>he said that this election, the stolen election myth has become an albatross for Republicans.</p>
<p>They have to get off that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to bring them down in 2022.</p>
<p>And the other thing is this anti-vax stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, voters completely forgot about the way that Newsom locked down this state</p>
<p>and then broke his own lockdowns.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s pro-vax, even to the point of vaccine mandates, whereas the Republicans</p>
<p>were not.</p>
<p>And frankly, I think, Chamath, your instincts on this were right on, which is people given</p>
<p>a choice between vaccine mandates or an anti-vax position, they will take the vax mandates.</p>
<p>Speaking of instincts, you want to go to the This Week in Facebook&rsquo;s dumpster fire?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So, I mean, where to begin?</p>
<p>This all started on Tuesday, 2016 at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.</p>
<p>OK, well, we&rsquo;ll get to your victory lap in a moment.</p>
<p>But just to queue up this past week on Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook</p>
<p>conducted in-depth research on the impacts of Instagram on children&rsquo;s mental health from</p>
<p>2018 to 2020.</p>
<p>But they never made the research public, nor did they make it available to academics or</p>
<p>lawmakers who requested it.</p>
<p>You will remember that last year, or earlier this year, Facebook started floating the idea</p>
<p>of Instagram for kids.</p>
<p>So in addition to having this research, which they didn&rsquo;t share, and here is the slide from</p>
<p>a presentation, it seems like the Wall Street Journal has somebody inside of Facebook giving</p>
<p>them everything, literally.</p>
<p>But here is the quote from presentation slides from 2019, internal Facebook presentation</p>
<p>slides.</p>
<p>We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls.</p>
<p>Teens blame Instagram for increases in the rate of anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>This reaction was unprompted and consistent across all groups, according to the Wall Street</p>
<p>Journal.</p>
<p>And Instagram obviously is a juggernaut, over a billion monthly active users and over 40%</p>
<p>of them are under the age of 22.</p>
<p>This is a really interesting issue because we are, this is probably the first example</p>
<p>of a broad based public policy, public health issue that tech has created, not necessarily</p>
<p>amplified, right, or exacerbated, but actually created.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re going to have to deal with this.</p>
<p>Before I, I want to give you guys, how would you define that issue?</p>
<p>Well, I think it is a public health issue.</p>
<p>If you have a large percentage of a cohort of our population, subject to mental health</p>
<p>issues and eating disorders, that&rsquo;s not a good place to be, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what we want as a healthy society, in a healthy society.</p>
<p>Our daughters, and it&rsquo;s probably, by the way, it&rsquo;s probably not more than just our daughters,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably our sons and daughters that are going through these issues.</p>
<p>The question is now about, you know, is it really a public health issue?</p>
<p>If you know about it, what responsibility do you have to do something?</p>
<p>And before I apply, and I just want to give you guys a little bit of data and just get</p>
<p>your reaction.</p>
<p>I actually want to go back to what&rsquo;s called the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement.</p>
<p>And the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement was entered in November of 1998.</p>
<p>Originally between the four largest US tobacco companies, Philip Morris, R.J.</p>
<p>Reynolds, Brown and Williamson, and Laurillard.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And the attorney generals of 46 states.</p>
<p>And essentially, it was an agreement that basically said, okay, we&rsquo;re going to net all</p>
<p>these Medicaid lawsuits together.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to hold these folks responsible for the downstream implications of the product</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve been selling our kids, and our, you know, adults population without the proper</p>
<p>disclosures, etc, etc, etc.</p>
<p>What happened before this tobacco MSA and big tobacco, though, was there was about eight</p>
<p>or 900 private claims that were filed from the mid 50s, all the way to the mid 90s.</p>
<p>David knows all this, because he made a movie about this.</p>
<p>The reason why I think this is interesting is that whether it happens in the United States</p>
<p>or someplace else, when I read that article, my immediate thought went to the tobacco MSA,</p>
<p>because I was like, well, okay, there&rsquo;s a public health issue that may or may not have</p>
<p>been covered up cover up, you know, it&rsquo;s definitely may or may not have been covered up, there</p>
<p>could be criminal liability, there&rsquo;s probably civil liability.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re, you know, a mother or father who&rsquo;s lost their kid to an eating disorder or to</p>
<p>depression, anxiety, bullying, suicide.</p>
<p>And I think like, I think the article in the Wall Street Journal yesterday was about like</p>
<p>human trafficking.</p>
<p>I mean, these are some gnarly, horribly complicated, gnarly issues.</p>
<p>To me, that&rsquo;s how I can edit the dots.</p>
<p>So I just love to hear.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, who&rsquo;s the Jeffrey Weigand in this case?</p>
<p>I mean, this is literally the movie The Insider, like somebody is leaking these documents out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a deep inside Facebook.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the Brown and Williamson was really about is that somebody had the studies</p>
<p>from the 70s of when correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, David, when the tobacco industry knew and</p>
<p>did nothing and covered it up.</p>
<p>And then they had the whistleblower.</p>
<p>So do you feel this is exactly analogous, Sachs?</p>
<p>Or how close to analogous?</p>
<p>Are we taking too big of a jump here?</p>
<p>Well, this, this idea that social media is as bad for you as cigarettes has been around</p>
<p>for several years now.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always wondered whether that was a hyperbolic claim.</p>
<p>I mean, it can it really be the case that using Facebook is as bad for you as lighting</p>
<p>something on fire and sucking its carbonized ash into your lungs?</p>
<p>I mean, I just, you know, yes, I think there&rsquo;s like a kernel of truth here in terms of yes,</p>
<p>it does exacerbate body image issues.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t believe that Facebook or social media created those issues.</p>
<p>I mean, these issues existed before.</p>
<p>And what Facebook does is connect people in a more intense way than they were connected.</p>
<p>And so it might intensify some of the social dynamics that already existed.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know that it created them.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re going to blame Facebook for this, there&rsquo;s a lot of other places you could</p>
<p>blame too.</p>
<p>I mean, why don&rsquo;t we be, why don&rsquo;t we blame the Met Gala?</p>
<p>You know, like, you know, look at all those beautiful people.</p>
<p>Well, we have had actually blame on the fashion industry for making unrealistic body types</p>
<p>and the magazines and they sell regularly.</p>
<p>My kids can&rsquo;t wear the full body stocking to school that Kim Kardashian wore to the</p>
<p>Met Gala or whatever.</p>
<p>I mean, and they&rsquo;re upset about that.</p>
<p>So should we ban the Met Gala?</p>
<p>Or I mean, let&rsquo;s look at all advertising.</p>
<p>I mean, all advertising just about focuses on unrealistically beautiful people.</p>
<p>And what about TV and movies?</p>
<p>I mean, Hollywood tends to cast people who are better looking or even the people reading</p>
<p>the news off teleprompters.</p>
<p>I mean, so this like body image and self-esteem issue is everywhere in our society.</p>
<p>And I think what social media does, as it does in so many of these cases, is really</p>
<p>just hold up a mirror to our society.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not, and yes, there&rsquo;s a lot of bad stuff happening on social media, but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of bad stuff happening in our society.</p>
<p>Well, let me, you know, here&rsquo;s one thing, David, the, there have been other industries</p>
<p>that have influenced this, but I don&rsquo;t think that they were as pernicious and as frequent</p>
<p>in their use of as social media, you know, reading a fashion magazine or watching TV,</p>
<p>like slightly different than an interactive version of that, that you might use for five</p>
<p>hours a day, like TikTok or Instagram.</p>
<p>And I just dropped in an image into the Zoom chat there about suicide rates in the United</p>
<p>States.</p>
<p>And this chart you&rsquo;ll see goes up to 2018.</p>
<p>And right around 2006, when we were at 11 percent, 11 suicides, I think per 10,000,</p>
<p>per 100,000, you&rsquo;ll see from 2006 to 2008, we go from, you know, 10 or 11, basically</p>
<p>suicides per 100,000 Americans, all the way up to 14, a 40% increase.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your evidence?</p>
<p>That correlates directly with social media becoming part of what we&rsquo;re doing here.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s your connection to what&rsquo;s happened?</p>
<p>I mean, is that among teens?</p>
<p>I mean, what is that?</p>
<p>This is overall suicide rates.</p>
<p>So I just think social media and the anxiety it produce could be actually having it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m open minded to that.</p>
<p>Can I clear up one thing, Sax?</p>
<p>I think that your argument would be reasonable if the first part of your argument made more</p>
<p>sense.</p>
<p>And to me, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And when you don&rsquo;t think that smoking and looking at your screen for an hour a day are</p>
<p>the same, let me just, from my perspective, explain to you why they are the same.</p>
<p>Whether or not you&rsquo;re ingesting something into your lungs, or whether or not it&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>eyes, at the end of the day, you&rsquo;re still activating physiological pathways, okay?</p>
<p>There are specific chemicals that are being created through smoking, specific chemicals</p>
<p>that are created through how your brain and your mind is reacting.</p>
<p>And all of these things, when you&rsquo;re bathed in these chemicals for long periods of time,</p>
<p>have known deleterious consequences.</p>
<p>Some manifest in tumors, which then result in cancer.</p>
<p>You die, lung cancer, cigarettes.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;re learning is some of these things result in long-term imbalances of these critical</p>
<p>hormones and chemicals you need in your brain to stay healthy.</p>
<p>And that results in anxiety, or the propensity to overeat, or the propensity to then throw</p>
<p>stuff up.</p>
<p>And so I would be careful about not assuming they&rsquo;re not physiologically the same.</p>
<p>I actually think they&rsquo;re more similar than different at a core physiological level.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that we&rsquo;re not used to the fact that something that is equivalent to looking</p>
<p>at a screen could actually do that to you.</p>
<p>I guess the question is, what&rsquo;s the threshold for regulatory intervention?</p>
<p>If someone did this at the scale, let&rsquo;s say there was a social network that had 100,000</p>
<p>users, and people were actively using the social network every day and having body</p>
<p>issues or whatever the consequences claim might be.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to find out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re about to find out.</p>
<p>Are we going to end up creating a regulatory framework across all of these things?</p>
<p>And I think that this goes also to the point of scale, because at the end of the day, if</p>
<p>you end up starting a business and you&rsquo;re not successful, you don&rsquo;t really find yourself</p>
<p>in the framing of, well, what are you doing wrong?</p>
<p>All of the companies that scale, the assumption is they did something wrong in order to get</p>
<p>to that scale.</p>
<p>Roloff, both of Sachs&rsquo; former colleague and obviously famed investor now at Sequoia Capital,</p>
<p>said that he only invests in businesses that pursue one of the 7 deadly sins, because those</p>
<p>are ultimately the things that consumers increment their consumption of.</p>
<p>There has to be a 7 deadly sin driver, underscoring the success of any business</p>
<p>that sells to consumers.</p>
<p>And if that is actually true, people aren&rsquo;t making kind of altruistic purchasing and</p>
<p>consumption decisions.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making decisions based on envy and based on greed and based on gluttony.</p>
<p>And all of those drivers, we kind of, you know, are effectively, Jamal, kind of related</p>
<p>back to these physiological drivers.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so like, yeah,</p>
<p>no, two things can be right.</p>
<p>What you said can be right.</p>
<p>But I think what also can be right is, are we really willing to bet that now there are</p>
<p>not 50 individually ambitious, politically ambitious state AGs, licking their chops,</p>
<p>reading this stuff, wondering how many kids in their state may have suffered from an eating</p>
<p>disorder or anxiety and blame it on one of these apps?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Are we convinced that not a single lawsuit will get filed?</p>
<p>Are we convinced that there&rsquo;s not going to be any class action?</p>
<p>And by the way, that&rsquo;s just the United States.</p>
<p>What is somebody that&rsquo;s sitting around a, you know, around a table of politicians desks</p>
<p>in, you know, Germany, Belgium, France, Thailand, they&rsquo;re going to find their issue in this</p>
<p>treasure trove of content that&rsquo;s being, you know, continuously drip fed out to the public.</p>
<p>I guess my point is that this is today&rsquo;s issue.</p>
<p>And business success, ultimately, over time in consumer markets will always ultimately</p>
<p>be driven by products that have at scale deleterious effects on the consumer market.</p>
<p>And those deleterious effects will be a result of some sort of kind of addictive or negative</p>
<p>kind of consequence that arises when folks use these things frequently.</p>
<p>And the market figures out how to optimize the utilization of products to increase revenue,</p>
<p>to increase profit.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what a free market does.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s right or wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just pointing out that there isn&rsquo;t, in my opinion, something unique here.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, Coca Cola is the largest beverage company in the world.</p>
<p>They sell 40 grams of sugar and 12 ounces of water.</p>
<p>And everyone buys that and they feel great from that.</p>
<p>And the sugar creates this addictive problem.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve got an obesity epidemic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not blaming Coca Cola.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the general trend in CPG over the last 50 years.</p>
<p>Increasing sugar, increasing salt.</p>
<p>And the difference is that this is not sugar, which is a generic compound.</p>
<p>This is, for example, no different than when Purdue Pharma started to make fentanyl.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really great drug.</p>
<p>It has incredibly superior advantages.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s used for a lot of very important things.</p>
<p>When that spilled over knowingly to a level of abuse,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think it was a lot of abuse, but there was enough</p>
<p>that essentially was overlooked in the building of a business.</p>
<p>It started with state AGs who stepped in.</p>
<p>And then it basically ultimately drove a federal agreement,</p>
<p>states agreements, a master settlement agreement around fentanyl.</p>
<p>And then Purdue essentially disgorging all the profits that they made.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Free markets should act in however way they&rsquo;re going to act.</p>
<p>But when those free market operators themselves are producing data that shows that,</p>
<p>oh, shit, hold on, something could be going wrong here.</p>
<p>Then I do think that politicians will step in regulators could step in.</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s crazy here is, you know, the FDA could actually act like</p>
<p>if the FDA is willing to act on jewel, what is the difference?</p>
<p>If the FDA says they feel like let&rsquo;s just assume that somebody in the FDA says,</p>
<p>we feel like we should have a responsibility to</p>
<p>think about mental health and eating disorders.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the slippery slope, right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the threshold?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>At what point do they say, no, we&rsquo;re not touching this?</p>
<p>And at what point do they say, yes, we are touching this?</p>
<p>Because at the end of the day, any successful consumer product</p>
<p>will have some degree of deleterious effect.</p>
<p>And this is why we have to have some perspective about it.</p>
<p>So in preparation for the segment, I asked my 11 year old girl daughter.</p>
<p>I know, Jake, how you don&rsquo;t think I talk to my kids, but actually I made no joke.</p>
<p>No joke.</p>
<p>I was thinking of three or four fun things.</p>
<p>Did she ask you if you were the FedEx guy?</p>
<p>She was like, who are you?</p>
<p>Why are you in my room?</p>
<p>Security.</p>
<p>So the first thing she said is, who are you?</p>
<p>And the second, and after I said, I&rsquo;m your dad.</p>
<p>And then the second thing she said is, the second thing she said is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use Instagram.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, well, what do you use?</p>
<p>She said, TikTok.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, the worst.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, well, what do you, what do you use TikTok for?</p>
<p>And she said, well, I watch dance videos.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, well, I&rsquo;ve been reading press articles that say that the only thing on TikTok</p>
<p>is sex and drugs.</p>
<p>And that it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s bringing you into a vortex of that.</p>
<p>And she said, I don&rsquo;t watch that.</p>
<p>I watch dance videos.</p>
<p>And then smart as a whip, she said, the only people who end up watching that are the ones</p>
<p>who keep indicating, she didn&rsquo;t use the word preference, but she basically said that they</p>
<p>keep getting that stuff because they like it and they keep getting fed more of what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re watching.</p>
<p>So look, I think we have to have a sense of perspective about this.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, products like Facebook and Instagram are ways for people to share</p>
<p>content and consume content for people they follow.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s basically it.</p>
<p>Now, is there a lot of bad shit on there?</p>
<p>Yeah, because there&rsquo;s a lot of bad shit in the world.</p>
<p>And should Facebook be trying to control this stuff?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t, at the end of the day, think it&rsquo;s cigarettes.</p>
<p>If they banned kids from using TikTok and Instagram until they were 16 years old, would</p>
<p>you be opposed to that?</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t let my kids use it.</p>
<p>And I have an 11-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t let her anywhere near.</p>
<p>We have a complete moratorium on that.</p>
<p>No social media is our rule.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe you let your kids use social media.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not passing judgment, but are you crazy?</p>
<p>I mean, like all they use it for is to watch dance videos.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I think Sax&rsquo;s point is an interesting one, which is, you know, based on what your</p>
<p>daughter said, that is effectively what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>It creates an acceleration of the natural evolution of these markets that historically</p>
<p>may have taken, call it 50 years for everyone to want to watch.</p>
<p>MTV didn&rsquo;t emerge for 60 years until there was radio and television broadcast signals.</p>
<p>And then everyone said, you know what, I want to watch rockers dancing on stage and going</p>
<p>nuts and whatever the consumer demand was that eventually evolved there.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening in social media is within seconds, you make evolutionary votes on what</p>
<p>you want in a media cycle.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, a few hours later, you&rsquo;re getting exactly what you want over</p>
<p>and over again.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t say no.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s effectively what digital media generally, social media in particular, has</p>
<p>some nuances to it.</p>
<p>But digital media generally has enabled is an acceleration of the natural consumption</p>
<p>trend that we see with humans, which is they eventually want to go to one of the seven</p>
<p>deadly sins.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what they kind of get stuck with.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve definitely talked about the danger of getting trapped in an information bubble and</p>
<p>a feedback loop.</p>
<p>And I do think that is a danger of these products.</p>
<p>But so is cable news.</p>
<p>I mean, you look at Twitter, it&rsquo;s an outrage machine and people get trapped in a cycle</p>
<p>and they only want to they either follow people to get outraged by them or just because they</p>
<p>want to kind of self indoctrinate themselves.</p>
<p>But that is basically why people watch cable news as well.</p>
<p>I mean, it is an outrage machine.</p>
<p>Your friend Tucker.</p>
<p>Or Rachel Maddow on MSNBC.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both feeding different variations of outrage.</p>
<p>And so my point is, look, I don&rsquo;t think these problems are unique to social media.</p>
<p>I think they pervade Hollywood and the entertainment industry and even the news industry.</p>
<p>Look, maybe we should put warning labels on them.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, we don&rsquo;t prohibit cigarettes.</p>
<p>We have an assumption of risk argument.</p>
<p>We put warning labels on them.</p>
<p>Maybe we need warning labels on these influencers.</p>
<p>More than that, right?</p>
<p>You put it you put it behind a counter and there&rsquo;s a strict prohibition on people under</p>
<p>the age of 18 being able to use them.</p>
<p>And when it looks like, you know, companies like Jewel were trying to circumvent those</p>
<p>things or make it appear more valuable, basically, to hook kids at a younger and younger age,</p>
<p>when they weren&rsquo;t capable of making those decisions.</p>
<p>They were held liable.</p>
<p>So, okay, so there&rsquo;s a really interesting topic there, which is should people under</p>
<p>the age of, say, 16 or 18 be prohibited products?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>Look, if you if you think 16 or 18, 16 or 18,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s 16 100% 18</p>
<p>16 100% and then there needs to be a way of opting out because I think 16 year olds are</p>
<p>quite sophisticated.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>We are living longer and longer than ever.</p>
<p>It is very likely that we&rsquo;re all going to generally live to our hundreds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the end of the world for these kids to have to wait an extra two or three years</p>
<p>until their literal physiology is a little bit better form so that they have better antibodies</p>
<p>to this shit.</p>
<p>And I think that if we as a adult population aren&rsquo;t necessarily going to take responsibility</p>
<p>for these kids, I think we&rsquo;re doing them a huge disservice.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t let your kids run around wherever they want.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t let them hold guns whenever they want.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t let them do a whole bunch of things that they may think is okay, but you know,</p>
<p>could have really bad consequences.</p>
<p>And so if you know that this stuff is happening, I think it&rsquo;s very different to look at a 22</p>
<p>year old and tell them what to do or not to do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re debating.</p>
<p>But what that data was about was about long-term systemic health issues to a large percentage</p>
<p>of girls.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really fucked up.</p>
<p>And a lot of the research that&rsquo;s come out, I dropped a couple of links in the chat.</p>
<p>You know, I haven&rsquo;t read the studies, but they&rsquo;re starting to show a correlation between</p>
<p>suicide rates and depression in young kids with social media.</p>
<p>And it does skew towards females.</p>
<p>The theory is females are more adept or more frequently in dynamic or complex social situations.</p>
<p>In other words, cyber bullying type situations where people use the social media to just</p>
<p>kind of bully each other.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I think you guys have a real point with respect to ages 13 to 16, because</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re allowed to use social media, or at least in terms of use prohibited</p>
<p>under age 13.</p>
<p>We all know that&rsquo;s a joke.</p>
<p>You and I have both had to build products that have to, you know, abide by COPPA laws.</p>
<p>And we always just kind of laugh at it because they&rsquo;re bullshit.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay, fair enough.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m saying is I think you guys have a real issue that needs to be explored around</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the usage for ages 13 to 16.</p>
<p>But look, what I worry about with these things is you&rsquo;re always playing whack-a-mole, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you basically ban social media.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, these kids, because they&rsquo;re very tech savvy, are going to find themselves</p>
<p>on text groups and text chats, and they&rsquo;ll be in Signal.</p>
<p>And you won&rsquo;t even be able to see what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I mean, at least on social media, you can see it.</p>
<p>The whole point of that, though, that makes sense to me.</p>
<p>Because I remember when I was growing up, and we all wanted to smoke,</p>
<p>it was a pain in the ass to get cigarettes.</p>
<p>So most of us just said, well, it&rsquo;s not worth it.</p>
<p>But yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>A handful of people found a way to get the cigarettes to sneak behind the school to smoke</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s very different than Juul walking into the middle of the lunchroom and passing</p>
<p>out berry flavored vape pens.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically saying, well, that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Obviously, that shouldn&rsquo;t be created packaging.</p>
<p>If you look at the why do you have the moral outrage around Juul and berry flavored vaping?</p>
<p>Look, why do you care about Juul?</p>
<p>Or why should we generally care about Juul and not care about soda companies making 40 grams</p>
<p>per 12 ounces of sugar, which is truly dangerous and damaging to the health?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;ve been drinking soda for a long time.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve already accepted.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve allowed ourselves to accept it.</p>
<p>We essentially on time.</p>
<p>And then we had this kind of, you know, tobacco moratorium that&rsquo;s now kind of.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, look, if we&rsquo;re not smoking, but freeberg, if you said if you said right now,</p>
<p>COVID is a disease of the old and the obese, you would be canceled.</p>
<p>Like somebody tried to say that recently, the guy from the point is you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>like people are very sensitive about this obesity thing.</p>
<p>And the second you say, like, we need to monitor it, they need to make</p>
<p>40% of Americans with type two diabetes, or whatever.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also personal freedom.</p>
<p>And do you want to drink a Coke Zero?</p>
<p>And so if you have personal freedom, why should some regulator tell you what</p>
<p>social media tool you should or shouldn&rsquo;t use?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>The cover up is what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re talking about minors, if we&rsquo;re talking about what are you going to do with a 13 to 16</p>
<p>year old?</p>
<p>What are you going to do with the 11 year old?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best part of your argument.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best part of your argument is when we&rsquo;re dealing with minors, I could I could see</p>
<p>the argument for more restrictions and and potentially support them depending on what</p>
<p>they are.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>What about minors not being able to drink soda?</p>
<p>You have to be 16 year old to drink soda.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s actually, that&rsquo;s where most diabetes and obesity is rooted in this country.</p>
<p>I actually am open minded to that position.</p>
<p>Actually, I know it sounds crazy.</p>
<p>But no, I think that that makes sense drinking Coca Cola makes no sense.</p>
<p>If we have a crazy obesity, if we can actually show that.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s ask the question.</p>
<p>So let me ask, let me ask, let me ask the second order question about this, which is</p>
<p>free burgers, right?</p>
<p>That drinking sodas for 13 year olds has got to be as harmful or more than using Facebook.</p>
<p>OK, so why do we never hear about that?</p>
<p>I would argue that there&rsquo;s something else going on here with this massive amount of</p>
<p>attacks on social networking companies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people who hate social networking in the traditional legacy media because they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been disrupted by Facebook, by these social media companies.</p>
<p>And so they took their money and they&rsquo;re looking to publicize any article about the</p>
<p>negative effects of these companies, which they&rsquo;re not threatened by Coca Cola.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not going to publish those kinds of studies.</p>
<p>So I just think that there&rsquo;s an argument that perhaps I&rsquo;m not saying you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s absolutely truth in what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all a matter of degree, though, and perspective.</p>
<p>And I do think that the traditional media has an incentive to blow this out of proportion</p>
<p>a little bit because they have an agenda for your science.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>And I think people in power, look, I think there&rsquo;s a positive thing about social networking.</p>
<p>I mean, because we haven&rsquo;t said one positive thing about it.</p>
<p>OK, social networking overall enables us to stay in touch with people we care about,</p>
<p>friends, family, and allows us to receive information from people we want to follow.</p>
<p>OK, we never talk about those positives.</p>
<p>I find it an incredibly convenient way to consume news.</p>
<p>OK, so we never talk about that.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s why, is because social media is fundamentally a democratizing force, right?</p>
<p>It enables people to coronate in a much more democratized way than they ever had been able</p>
<p>to before.</p>
<p>I do think that is threatening to people in power.</p>
<p>And given the chance, they would like to suppress it.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg gave a speech a few years ago about social networks being, I think, called the</p>
<p>fourth estate, with the third estate being the press.</p>
<p>And in the same way that there are people in power who want to censor the press, I do</p>
<p>believe that there are people in power who want to censor social networks because they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like the disruptive democratizing force that it represents.</p>
<p>And there is a lot of positive to that in the world.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re mixing up a lot of things there.</p>
<p>So yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think any of us are saying cancel these companies and remove them from the internet.</p>
<p>I think what we&rsquo;re saying is there are very specific ways in which certain features are</p>
<p>built, that they are expressed in features that are now apparently according to their</p>
<p>own work and exploration, are linked to mental health issues.</p>
<p>So I think the point is, people should now decide whether to your point, we should ignore</p>
<p>it because the good vastly outweighs, you know, what&rsquo;s a third of girls who the fuck</p>
<p>cares, right?</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re chicks, so whatever.</p>
<p>Or you say, actually, this is a really big problem.</p>
<p>And so let&rsquo;s step up and fix it, because somebody needs to protect these people.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re 16, or 17, or 18, do whatever you want.</p>
<p>Like we let people do today, you want to drink a Coca Cola every day, get diabetes, you can</p>
<p>do that.</p>
<p>Nobody tries to stop you.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>You want to smoke a pack of smokes a day, you can do that.</p>
<p>Nobody stops you.</p>
<p>But we do a lot of other things to try to help kids.</p>
<p>I think I think we&rsquo;re only talking about ages, if we&rsquo;re talking about the minors, the kids,</p>
<p>I think you and I can find agreement on this issue, I think, but</p>
<p>I do think that the demonization of social media goes well beyond that.</p>
<p>But look, I think you&rsquo;ve got a great point with respect to the kids.</p>
<p>Do you guys believe, and this is a theory that&rsquo;s been growing, that tick tock, run by</p>
<p>the Chinese government is trying to reprogram ethics, morals and doing psych, psych ops,</p>
<p>basically, there&rsquo;s psy ops on our children.</p>
<p>No, Jay, there&rsquo;s something bigger than that.</p>
<p>I mean, I think all of you guys probably upgraded to 14.8 iOS this week, I hope you haven&rsquo;t and</p>
<p>everybody listening, if you haven&rsquo;t, please go upgrade it.</p>
<p>But, you know, the Israeli spy firm NSO had apparently created a zero click exploit for</p>
<p>the iPhone, where you could turn on the camera and the microphone and basically spy on folks,</p>
<p>completely unaware.</p>
<p>And, you know, Jason, and I were talking about this.</p>
<p>And I think Jason, you were the one that said, you&rsquo;re like, yeah, we&rsquo;ve been living with</p>
<p>that with tick tock for years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as if, you know, NSO just licensed it randomly to the Saudi government.</p>
<p>I mean, this tool has been available for a while.</p>
<p>So to your point,</p>
<p>but do we think that the Chinese government tick tock are trying to program our children</p>
<p>to be more deviant and to create social unrest?</p>
<p>And no, you don&rsquo;t think that they&rsquo;re trying to steer them with the algorithm towards bad</p>
<p>results, because they&rsquo;re not letting their kids play video games?</p>
<p>No, I think that Wall Street,</p>
<p>did you see the Wall Street Journal article that I just sent to you guys?</p>
<p>Wall Street Journal article basically created a bunch of kids accounts,</p>
<p>and then did searches or what started to go down a rabbit hole.</p>
<p>And just with one keyword search, you know, these kids went into deep,</p>
<p>you know, kink BDSM sort of results.</p>
<p>This is a pretty straightforward weighted tree algorithm.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So like, when you start on a branch of a tree, and you keep clicking on those things,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you will get.</p>
<p>This is no different than how Facebook&rsquo;s algorithm works,</p>
<p>how Google search algorithm works for you.</p>
<p>Once you start behaving with clicks, or swipes, or likes, they use that as a feedback loop,</p>
<p>and they wait basically weigh the next set of results.</p>
<p>So David&rsquo;s daughter is right, if you click on sex, drugs, and rock and roll, that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not all you&rsquo;re going to get, but it&rsquo;s going to be a large percentage of what you get,</p>
<p>because the algorithm in a blunt way, assumes that that&rsquo;s what you like.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure that this is repeating anything that&rsquo;s so, you know, it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>obvious that that&rsquo;s how it should work if they want to have maximum utilization.</p>
<p>Well, you know, the thing that&rsquo;s slightly different about TikTok is, you know,</p>
<p>in Facebook or Instagram, you build your feed and Twitter,</p>
<p>and then it serves it up algorithmically on TikTok, it uses the entire corpus.</p>
<p>So if you do one search for a keyword,</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s not just a subset of what your friends posted in some ranked order,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the entire corpus of like long tail.</p>
<p>And so what they show in this TikTok is like how quickly a child who just types in one keyword can</p>
<p>be have their feed be 90% drug use. And, you know, sadomasochistic, whatever you&rsquo;re into sex,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>If the content is obscene, then it should be taken down to begin with. Okay. And look,</p>
<p>my takeaway from this conversation is that we need to do something different for kids.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a flat out prohibition or what, but yeah, but look, so the TikTok algorithm</p>
<p>thing, if you want to keep seeing more and more content related to something fine,</p>
<p>the algorithm is going to give you more and more of what you want as a consumer.</p>
<p>But maybe for kids, there needs to be some guardrails around that. And we don&rsquo;t direct,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t direct kids towards certain kinds of content around, you know, sex or drugs or violence.</p>
<p>I have to constantly remind parents like YouTube,</p>
<p>kids should not use YouTube because it goes really to crazy dark places.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s kids YouTube and kids YouTube, they add each and every video. Now you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>still get some of that consumption and unboxing of things and your kids will ask you to buy a</p>
<p>bunch of stuff, but you&rsquo;re not going to get straight up sex, violence, and you know, everything</p>
<p>else. I&rsquo;ll tell you what does happen. I put kids YouTube on my kids, my four year olds iPad.</p>
<p>And then the other day, she said she saw some like scary horror thing on there and she couldn&rsquo;t sleep</p>
<p>and she woke up in the middle of the night because you know, if we&rsquo;re not doing our job</p>
<p>as parents curating the content and curating what our kids are doing, and we&rsquo;re leaving it to this</p>
<p>app, we&rsquo;re totally effed. And that&rsquo;s what I realized I did my laziness in like, just thinking</p>
<p>like, oh, there was something she wanted to watch. I put the app on there and didn&rsquo;t pay</p>
<p>attention for a few weeks. And all of a sudden she had gone down the rabbit hole, found something</p>
<p>scary. I don&rsquo;t know if you guys use this, but I use an app called Custodio. It&rsquo;s with a Q,</p>
<p>Q-U-S-T-U-D-I-O. And you can kind of like lock down all these devices. And then at the end of</p>
<p>every week, it gives you an email of all the app usage and all the links that my kids clicked on,</p>
<p>or just my oldest one, he&rsquo;s the only one that has a phone.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s nice. And you had a discussion with them about that? Like, Hey,</p>
<p>yeah, it&rsquo;s a privilege to have this. And yeah, it&rsquo;s gonna tell me what you did.</p>
<p>I agree. It&rsquo;s still super, super hard. But this is why I think you need to have some blunt force</p>
<p>instruments right now. And my blunt force instruments are you&rsquo;re not allowed to have</p>
<p>well, the ones that we&rsquo;ve, we&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re not allowed to have TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook,</p>
<p>Instagram, Twitter. Yes, hard now. And the only reason we allow YouTube is because a lot of the</p>
<p>school links are to videos inside of YouTube. And so you can&rsquo;t lock it down. But that&rsquo;s why I use</p>
<p>this custodial app to see what they&rsquo;re watching on YouTube. Even then, though, it&rsquo;s not perfect.</p>
<p>By the way, this thing that just came from the Pentagon is a total Friday news drop.</p>
<p>I mean, talk about a Friday news drop. I don&rsquo;t know what we don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>US military acknowledges Kabul drone strike killed 10 civilians, including seven children.</p>
<p>We knew this. They&rsquo;re just confirming something that had been exposed. The New York Times did</p>
<p>excellent reporting on excellent reporting by the New York Times. That was incredible journalism.</p>
<p>I mean, did you guys see that they were like watching frame for frame of like a video,</p>
<p>then they were like going to Google Maps, they were comparing colors of cars, they were looking</p>
<p>at sides of buildings. Incredible reporting by the New York Times. It was really the I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obviously a tragedy was the final debacle of our Afghanistan involvement. This was a</p>
<p>foreign aid worker, who actually he was there as an aid worker. They had him on video loading up his</p>
<p>car with plastic jugs of water. Somehow they thought these were explosives or something like</p>
<p>that. He was doing his errands and then he comes home. They hit the car with a massive missile</p>
<p>from one of these Reaper drones. It kills him as well as basically 10 members of his extended</p>
<p>family, including seven children. Now, the I mean, I think I understand why this well, we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exactly know why this happened. And I think it needs to be investigated. Obviously, the military</p>
<p>in Kabul was on high alert, because we just had that bombing at the airport. And it was the</p>
<p>bloodiest day for America in Afghanistan. I think we had 313 soldiers killed a few days before this,</p>
<p>but it just shows the kind of mistakes that we can make even fighting drone warfare. You know,</p>
<p>the idea was ‚Äì The term casualties of war exists for a reason. Like, this is how war works. You</p>
<p>cannot do it perfectly. It&rsquo;s messy. Everybody, innocent people dies is why war is the worst</p>
<p>thing in the world. It should be the last resort. Right. And how did we ever think we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>win hearts and minds in this country by, you know, like, we made too many mistakes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not interested in democracy, like in the way we want them to be, and the West wants</p>
<p>them to be. By the way, that&rsquo;s forcing it down their throats is not going to work. We could</p>
<p>have maintained a base there. There were better ways to exit. But let&rsquo;s fix the schools in</p>
<p>California first. Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s, I think that&rsquo;ll ultimately, I think people are going to</p>
<p>forget those images of people on planes and just think, thank God that&rsquo;s over. I think now that</p>
<p>there hasn&rsquo;t been 20, you know, and hopefully there&rsquo;s not another 911. All right. Let&rsquo;s wrap</p>
<p>with Ellen Powell wrote a piece for the New York Times op ed section, section on sexism in tech,</p>
<p>using the Elizabeth Holmes trial as the main example. She was also on tech checks, the NBC</p>
<p>show, and discussed her op ed. Quote, home should be held accountable for her actions as chief</p>
<p>executive of their nose. And it can be sexist to hold her accountable for alleged, very serious</p>
<p>wrongdoing and not hold an array of men accountable for reports of wrongdoing and bad judgment.</p>
<p>She uses Travis Kalanick and Adam Newman as examples of men who have engaged in questionable</p>
<p>unethical, even dangerous behavior in tech without much legal penalty. And that they both went on to</p>
<p>start new companies. Her main example, however, is bias is tech. Executive Kevin Burns, who is</p>
<p>the former CEO of jewel j u u l, who helped the cigarette vaping company raise $12 billion. But</p>
<p>he left jewel amidst a lot of legal blowback. And just this past week with a bunch of with a bunch</p>
<p>of cash with about Yeah, I mean, of course, you get that you secure the bag on the way out Adam</p>
<p>Newman to. And yeah, don&rsquo;t drop the bag. You have one job to do. Don&rsquo;t drop the bag. Yes, run. But</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do not drop the bag. So she meant she mentioned other stories like juicero. If you</p>
<p>guys remember this company, a couple years ago, they raised $1 million pre launch, right? It was</p>
<p>a juicer that, you know, was supposed to juice for my juicer. Oh, yeah. The claim that they made was</p>
<p>that inside of the packets was like fresh vegetables. And this thing squeezed the fresh</p>
<p>vegetables and fresh juice juice came out. And it turns out that the bag was just filled with juice.</p>
<p>And so no, no, I think the bag was filled with shaved vegetables or whatever. But</p>
<p>you squeeze the bag squeeze the bag. So that it was already pre juiced is what,</p>
<p>you know, Olivia Zaleski, who&rsquo;s now Olivia Peterson. It was she basically put me she</p>
<p>kind of made a whole video and put it on Bloomberg. They had juice in these packets.</p>
<p>And they were telling people what they thought. Yeah. So they could have put it into a machine</p>
<p>and pay $7 juice, then took that juice, put it in a bag. Yeah, that was supposed to be fresh</p>
<p>vegetables sold that as fresh vegetables to then get juiced together. charged $8 a bag for this</p>
<p>stuff. And who invested in that who invested in that who wrote $100 million ventures anyway,</p>
<p>a lot of people. It was a huge, it was a huge, like, you know, better for the planet story.</p>
<p>But it turns out that the hardware didn&rsquo;t work. And then they ended up kind of faking it till</p>
<p>you make it. It was very similar to Theranos in the sense that there was a piece of hardware that</p>
<p>made a claim that wasn&rsquo;t necessarily true. And granted, no lives were at risk in this particular</p>
<p>case. But some might argue lives were at risk in the case of jewel. But I think you know,</p>
<p>you see this a lot more in these kind of hardware, particularly in life sciences companies.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a business like like Zymergen is a good example, right? It&rsquo;s very hard tech,</p>
<p>very deep tech. Josh Hoffman did an incredible job fundraising rates of $400 million round from</p>
<p>SoftBank took the company public, then they go public. And a few weeks later, they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>Oh, wait, sorry, we don&rsquo;t actually have any product or any revenue. And we talked about</p>
<p>this a few months ago, a few weeks ago, the stock completely collapsed. There&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>company called Berkeley lights, which went public. And yesterday, Scorpion Capital,</p>
<p>one of these short sellers put out 160 page report on these guys, showing that Berkeley</p>
<p>lights his product, actually, it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a hardware life sciences hardware that costs $2</p>
<p>million. They&rsquo;ve sold it into all the pharma companies. And Scorpion saying, Look, this thing</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work. It&rsquo;s a total fraud. Like there&rsquo;s no, the machine doesn&rsquo;t do what they claim it does.</p>
<p>Okay, but so to Alan Powell&rsquo;s point, is there a double standard or not?</p>
<p>Right. And so these were all run by male CEOs, and nothing happened to them.</p>
<p>And as well.</p>
<p>Um, yeah, yeah, they&rsquo;re all white.</p>
<p>All right. First of all, let&rsquo;s take it easy on the white guys.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s three other white guys.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking a qualifying question.</p>
<p>It is. So here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll ask is,</p>
<p>I mean, is this a surprise that white dudes will get a hall pass?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a shocker.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s considered it&rsquo;s considered entrepreneurial failure. But when it comes</p>
<p>to the woman that everyone I think was excited about seeing succeed, because she was a woman,</p>
<p>it becomes fraud. And I think well, you know, there&rsquo;s two different things. Yeah.</p>
<p>Is it free? But isn&rsquo;t there two different things between, you know, where she obviously misled</p>
<p>people in a pre meditated way and lied to them, like taking their blood sample, and then putting</p>
<p>it in a fake machine, then doing it in the back on an Abbott machine, and then bringing the results</p>
<p>back and making it on her. There are no Edison machine. I mean, this is literal wire for a</p>
<p>securities fraud. In these other cases, is it people who are ambitious, if you look at the</p>
<p>juicer. Oh, it&rsquo;s kind of like this is a stupid idea that got overfunded.</p>
<p>He put he put juice in a packet and told you</p>
<p>he put chef shaved vegetables in the packet, and then use hydraulic, which is an actual real thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually not correct. Watch the video that Olivia put on Bloomberg a few years ago,</p>
<p>which I just showed you pictures of it. I mean, maybe there&rsquo;s a different one.</p>
<p>What they showed is that it was already squeezed. Yes, there was</p>
<p>shit in there. But it was already squeezed. Like, all right, well,</p>
<p>take it all back. I mean, it was like, it was like a crazy story when this came out.</p>
<p>And everyone&rsquo;s like, Oh, my God, like, it was a standard, like, hardware is really difficult.</p>
<p>You know, novel hardware technology is really difficult. So you fake it till you make it.</p>
<p>In some cases, you launch a product that doesn&rsquo;t even work. You know, and there&rsquo;s just and this</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t just in hardware. It&rsquo;s also in like science, as you see this a lot, where you ship a product,</p>
<p>I would probably say that if if regulators believe that those CEOs</p>
<p>tried to commit fraud, they would have done challenges, right? Maybe they still will,</p>
<p>they should follow up with those folks. So why do you think they went after Elizabeth Holmes,</p>
<p>Jamal? Because it was actually there was a legal case. There&rsquo;s I think there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>really important there are two things at play in Theranos, which is different. Number one is</p>
<p>the kinds of investors that were involved here are extremely powerful folks, not necessarily,</p>
<p>you know, technology capable, but very, very well known, highly connected people in the</p>
<p>establishment. And the second was that they were operating in a regulated market, which has very</p>
<p>strict laws. Look, I&rsquo;ve tried to build competing products to Theranos for years, I&rsquo;ve been pretty</p>
<p>public about this, I&rsquo;ve tried five or six times, they failed every single time, I couldn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>get out of the starting line. You know, these tests would never work without with a single</p>
<p>drop of blood, it just didn&rsquo;t make any sense. The only version of this problem that has been</p>
<p>solved well, is the ability to detect cell free cancer DNA in blood, right using a very small</p>
<p>quantum of blood. Companies like garden and grail have actually done and built a great business out</p>
<p>of it. But it requires extremely sophisticated machinery sold to them by Illumina and others. So</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re operating in a regulated market, the bar is higher, there is a lot more scrutiny.</p>
<p>And then on top of that, I think she compounded it by including folks and raising capital from</p>
<p>folks that may not have actually known and been able to diligence. And so that&rsquo;s the cycle of</p>
<p>fraud that may or may not have occurred there. And she has to, or they have, there&rsquo;s a burden</p>
<p>to prove that. It&rsquo;s very different, I think, over here in an unregulated market where</p>
<p>you can just kind of build whatever you want. And if smart investors look,</p>
<p>Nick just put in the group chat. So the investors in Juicero were Google Ventures,</p>
<p>Kleiner Perkins, Thrive Capital. I mean, these are all very sophisticated folks that,</p>
<p>you know, made a decision. And, you know, it&rsquo;s probably not the case that they were lied to.</p>
<p>I understand why they made the Juicero mistake, because at the time, fresh pressed juice using</p>
<p>hydraulics was a thing. And this guy said, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to do. I&rsquo;m going to use hydraulics,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to squeeze the vegetable so you get the best stuff out of it. I understand why they</p>
<p>fell for it. Because my wife was buying that press. What the fuck are you talking about?</p>
<p>My wife, Jay, was buying that press juicery juice in LA. You remember this trend?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pure sugar. That stuff is pure sugar.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s vegetable juice too, but it would cost like $11 because they would use so much</p>
<p>vegetables. And I saw these presses they used. It&rsquo;s incredibly inefficient, but the juice tastes</p>
<p>really great. But the thing I have a problem with, with Ellen Powell story is she brings up,</p>
<p>you know, the harassment stuff. And, you know, this is an issue of gender, etc. But</p>
<p>on this week in startups, I&rsquo;ve been covering fraud after fraud. I don&rsquo;t know if you saw App Annie</p>
<p>got an SEC fine yesterday.</p>
<p>What happened, Jason? Because I saw you&hellip;</p>
<p>With App Annie, they told people who were using their analytics products,</p>
<p>building apps, there&rsquo;s like 8 million people, that they would never sell their data except</p>
<p>an aggregate. And then they went to Wall Street people and said, here&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll sell you the data. And you can trade on it. And so&hellip;</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. So I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s like insider trading exactly, but it might be. But anyway,</p>
<p>the guy got fined $10 million.</p>
<p>Well, it kind of is. That&rsquo;s the whole point of reg FD. The whole point is if somebody knows</p>
<p>something, if you&rsquo;re a financial actor, Jason, and you know something, so like if all of us were</p>
<p>sitting around a table, you know, and somebody said something about a random public company&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not public information.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s not known, two things have to happen. Number one is I, when I receive it,</p>
<p>must not do anything with it. And that second, that person who disclosed it</p>
<p>needs to then file an 8k and say, oops, I accidentally said this.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Now where does&hellip;</p>
<p>This is an end around around things like reg FD, I think that&rsquo;s a really big deal.</p>
<p>Well, and then I guess the question is like, what happens with people who use planet labs or</p>
<p>whatever to, you know, to satellite images of the target parking lot or put people as spotters</p>
<p>outside of Starbucks and count the people coming in and out? Is that public information?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s public. But if you have a terms of service that says one thing&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re violating that, but then you may also be violating reg FD.</p>
<p>So they haven&rsquo;t gone after people for on the other side of the trade for securities fraud,</p>
<p>but they charged him with securities fraud. He pays 10 million bucks. I think he&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>penalty box, can&rsquo;t be, you know, run up, be a public officer for three years. Then we had</p>
<p>Headspin. I don&rsquo;t know if you saw that SaaS company, but Headspin was involved in just</p>
<p>basically straight up lying about their SaaS software. Then you have Tether, the stablecoin,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been banned from New York by the DOJ. They&rsquo;ve been banned by the Canadian regulators</p>
<p>for the first two crypto exchanges there. And supposedly the DOJ is investigating them.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s about five ICOs in New York that have been prosecuted already. So</p>
<p>I know Ellen&rsquo;s saying like, they&rsquo;re not prosecuting men, but I&rsquo;m seeing them all the</p>
<p>time. Yeah. They&rsquo;re just not, the press is not obsessed with them because let&rsquo;s face it,</p>
<p>Elizabeth Holmes was, she was weird. I mean, the voice, there&rsquo;s a lot of peculiar things about her</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t see in other folks who are boring, right?</p>
<p>By the way, what you just said is part of the sexist claim that Ellen made,</p>
<p>which is that we talked about her dress and how she dressed and how she talked.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t talk about that kind of stuff when it comes to other entrepreneurs and</p>
<p>Of course they did. Adam Neumann, they were talking about him being a hippie,</p>
<p>walking around with bare feet, being 6'7&quot;. Every profile, she&rsquo;s wrong in that case.</p>
<p>Every profile of Adam Neumann talked about his personal life and his wife is married to,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s her name? Gwyneth Paltrow&rsquo;s cousin.</p>
<p>Gwyneth Paltrow. So Ellen&rsquo;s a hundred percent wrong on that one.</p>
<p>Yeah. And didn&rsquo;t Elizabeth Holmes make it relevant by dressing deliberately,</p>
<p>styling herself in the fashion of Steve Jobs with a black turtleneck and the glasses?</p>
<p>I mean, she portrayed herself as the next Steve Jobs. I mean, it was part of the grift.</p>
<p>It was a setup.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. Now, did gender play into it? Yeah, but I think not necessarily in the way</p>
<p>that Ellen Powell thinks. In this sense, that the media wanted to believe so badly</p>
<p>that the next Steve Jobs was going to be a woman that they kind of look past what should have been</p>
<p>staring them in the face. I mean, look, if a man had gotten out there wearing the black turtleneck</p>
<p>and the John Lennon glasses or whatever, they would have said, who is this clown?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. But they suspended.</p>
<p>You have to dress up as Steve Jobs in the next episode, Freeberg. You can make it work.</p>
<p>Can we all do it? Can we see?</p>
<p>Oh, let&rsquo;s do a Halloween episode where we all show up. I&rsquo;ll do Elizabeth Holmes for</p>
<p>a Halloween episode. But no, but that&rsquo;s like a nested Steve Jobs. So like you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be Elizabeth Holmes as Steve Jobs. Yeah, we should all do our own versions of, yes.</p>
<p>Elizabeth as Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>I think, Sax, you&rsquo;re entirely right. I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I think this is the way that gender has played into it,</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a lot of people who really wanted the Elizabeth Holmes story to be true.</p>
<p>And frankly, she used that in order to perpetuate her fraud.</p>
<p>She may not have used it, but she was definitely influenced.</p>
<p>Or she benefited from it.</p>
<p>She definitely used it.</p>
<p>I want to ask you guys kind of a controversial question,</p>
<p>because this story made me think a lot about some of what&rsquo;s gone on in businesses that I know of,</p>
<p>and where I know that there is, to some degree, fraud and misrepresentation happening by the CEO</p>
<p>and founder. And this is a little known secret in Silicon Valley, or a little spoken of secret,</p>
<p>which is that more often than not, if you know about fraud at a company in Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re encouraged to keep your mouth shut.</p>
<p>Because the idea is at the end of the day, if they&rsquo;re gaining lots of capital,</p>
<p>more capital floats all boats and more money will rush into that market.</p>
<p>And so if there&rsquo;s businesses that you&rsquo;re competing with that are committing fraud,</p>
<p>rather than raise your hand, which then people say,</p>
<p>Hey, look, if you&rsquo;re going to raise your hand and claim fraud and talk negatively about another</p>
<p>company, people are going to start doing that about you.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going to start doing that about your portfolio.</p>
<p>And so you guys know this, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re discouraged from calling out these sorts of moments when you see them in Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>because there is the perceived kind of look, we&rsquo;re all in a club together.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all in it together.</p>
<p>We got to be careful not to talk smack because then capital will stop coming in.</p>
<p>People will come after you.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re much more of a supportive open community.</p>
<p>But have you guys experienced that?</p>
<p>I have with at least two companies in the last year.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve kept my mouth shut because&hellip;</p>
<p>And by the way, I don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s necessarily harm going on.</p>
<p>But I know of misrepresentation.</p>
<p>But the investors are like, look, we&rsquo;d love to see these guys succeed,</p>
<p>because that would be good for you in this way.</p>
<p>Because then you would be more money flowing in and yada, yada.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s always a narrative around why you don&rsquo;t want to do this.</p>
<p>Why you don&rsquo;t want to call these things out.</p>
<p>I called it out.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve still got a crazy founder denouncing me years later.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I hate&hellip;</p>
<p>Who has an SEC enforcement against them.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>A sanction.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, look.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, Freeberg, that there&rsquo;s very little upshot to doing it.</p>
<p>But look, I hate&hellip;</p>
<p>We have to distinguish between fraud and sort of puffing.</p>
<p>Okay, here&rsquo;s the thing that I think Ellen Powell&rsquo;s kind of missing.</p>
<p>Is when she criticizes all these founders who are</p>
<p>visionary and evangelical and promoting something that ends up not working.</p>
<p>That is not fraud.</p>
<p>Every startup, we ask the founder, how are you going to change the world?</p>
<p>What is your big idea?</p>
<p>What is the big dream?</p>
<p>And then they lay out this really pretty unrealistic set of things.</p>
<p>Unrealistic in the sense that it comes true maybe one out of a thousand times, right?</p>
<p>Every startup, their founding mission is a bit of an overpromise.</p>
<p>And just because it doesn&rsquo;t come true doesn&rsquo;t make it fraud.</p>
<p>I think that a lot of people out in the non-Silicon Valley investing world</p>
<p>would interpret that as fraud.</p>
<p>Because a founder told them something that ends up not happening, not ends up being true.</p>
<p>100% correct.</p>
<p>And this is why you really&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very dangerous to take money outside of Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>because people don&rsquo;t really understand this distinction, okay?</p>
<p>Just because it doesn&rsquo;t work out and what you said ended up not being true,</p>
<p>does not make it fraud.</p>
<p>What is fraud is when you lie about&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before, when you lie about the past.</p>
<p>And what Elizabeth Holmes is accused of doing by these prosecutors</p>
<p>is, again, lying about the present-day capabilities of her product</p>
<p>and actually falsifying documents.</p>
<p>She actually falsified documents.</p>
<p>That is the fraud.</p>
<p>That is the line you cannot cross.</p>
<p>They changed blood test results.</p>
<p>Listen, said another way, Sax,</p>
<p>Elizabeth Holmes&rsquo; vision of taking less blood</p>
<p>and doing more tests with it and being more efficient</p>
<p>is a completely valid thing to pursue.</p>
<p>Chamath just said he pursued it five times and failed five times.</p>
<p>Completely failed.</p>
<p>Lying, completely failed.</p>
<p>Tens of millions of dollars burned in a pile.</p>
<p>But what we all buy into here is what if it does work one in a thousand times?</p>
<p>What Elizabeth Holmes did was she lied about the results.</p>
<p>And not only did she lie about the results,</p>
<p>she lied about real people&rsquo;s blood test results,</p>
<p>like actual civilians.</p>
<p>Well, I have some empathy for Elizabeth Jobs in the following way.</p>
<p>When I was told&hellip;</p>
<p>When I was told&hellip;</p>
<p>Holmes, you mean Steve Holmes.</p>
<p>No, no, hold on.</p>
<p>When I was told&hellip;</p>
<p>I think I told this story.</p>
<p>I was asking an investor,</p>
<p>hey, what&rsquo;s the hottest company around?</p>
<p>This is in, you know, 2013 or 14.</p>
<p>He said Theranos.</p>
<p>And there was no way to get connected to the company.</p>
<p>So then I was like,</p>
<p>you know, I had heard just the bullet point.</p>
<p>One drop of blood, full characterization of your,</p>
<p>you know, be able to do a blood test, etc.</p>
<p>I thought this is an incredible idea.</p>
<p>But because I had no way of getting connected,</p>
<p>now thank God that turned out to be a good thing.</p>
<p>I was like, well, fuck it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just start my own version.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll figure out how to do this.</p>
<p>And Jason, as you said,</p>
<p>it turned out to be much, much harder than I thought.</p>
<p>And five different iterations, five different teams.</p>
<p>And, you know, PhDs from MIT, Stanford, everything.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t, Caltech, we couldn&rsquo;t figure it out.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not wrong to want to believe</p>
<p>that something is possible.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not illegal to do that.</p>
<p>But as David said, the minute that you try to,</p>
<p>you tell lies about the past</p>
<p>in order to basically then change the future</p>
<p>in a way that shouldn&rsquo;t happen,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s real, that&rsquo;s really unfair.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s, what do you think of the defense</p>
<p>that Balwani, the Svengali defense?</p>
<p>I saw Tara Swisher and some New York Times reporters</p>
<p>and other reporters were basically not buying it.</p>
<p>And we talked about this last time, didn&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m just curious</p>
<p>if you have been following the trial.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s hard for somebody who in the moment</p>
<p>took credit for every decision,</p>
<p>for every piece of press,</p>
<p>for claim to be the Jobsian micromanager</p>
<p>to all of a sudden now turn around</p>
<p>and say, no, that wasn&rsquo;t me making the decisions.</p>
<p>I was under the spell of somebody else.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a tough argument to make.</p>
<p>Also, I think, you know, this is going to come out,</p>
<p>but she actually fired Balwani.</p>
<p>So if she fired him, how was she,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s harder to do the Svengali defense, I think.</p>
<p>Well, maybe they&rsquo;re both guilty.</p>
<p>Svengali.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re both guilty.</p>
<p>It could be an and.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s Svengali, Sven, Svengali.</p>
<p>All right, listen, we&rsquo;ll close on this.</p>
<p>MailChimp has sold to Intuit for $12 billion</p>
<p>in the largest bootstrap acquisition ever.</p>
<p>We all know MailChimp, and we all know QuickBooks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge deal.</p>
<p>I have one issue with this,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s true or not,</p>
<p>but apparently none of the employees have any equity.</p>
<p>Yes, and that was what I was about to get to.</p>
<p>Employees didn&rsquo;t have equity.</p>
<p>However, and I&rsquo;ve known MailChimp for a while,</p>
<p>for over a decade, been using the product.</p>
<p>I know the founder had had them on the podcast before.</p>
<p>Have they been a sponsor of your product?</p>
<p>They sponsored in the first year, I think, or two, and.</p>
<p>Were you an angel investor?</p>
<p>I was not.</p>
<p>I tried to be, and he said, we&rsquo;re never going to ever raise money.</p>
<p>And he also apparently said he was never, ever going to sell.</p>
<p>And he was also never going to sell.</p>
<p>They gave.</p>
<p>He had 12 billion reasons to change his mind.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>They gave him the 20%.</p>
<p>My understanding was employees got a 20% cash bonus,</p>
<p>and they were amongst the highest paid in the industry.</p>
<p>So their plan was, instead of giving people some big reward at the end,</p>
<p>they were just distributing cash.</p>
<p>Basically, they were just distributing cash.</p>
<p>So if you had 100, if you were 150k developer, you got 30k on top.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an unreasonable way to run a business that has no outside investors that,</p>
<p>you know, and employees know that going in,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t go in with the expectation of equity,</p>
<p>they went in with the expectation of a high salary and a big bonus, and they got it.</p>
<p>I do that in a few companies, few companies that I own, I do that.</p>
<p>But what I also do is I let them buy into the company every year.</p>
<p>I just think that it&rsquo;s a good principle to have like an ownership in the business.</p>
<p>I think you should be paying a lot of money,</p>
<p>and we should pay cash bonuses for achieving results.</p>
<p>We do that.</p>
<p>But then what we also say is if you want to buy equity, come and buy it.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re probably right from a performance perspective,</p>
<p>Chamath.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessarily a moral obligation to do that, right?</p>
<p>How this guy wants to run his business, up to him.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, people made the choice, voted.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, people that work at your house,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t give them equity in your house, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you own the house, you give them cash.</p>
<p>Or people who play for a basketball team are not allowed to get equity in the team.</p>
<p>But in other countries, right?</p>
<p>I think in soccer, you can.</p>
<p>Yes, but I think one of the best things about Silicon Valley is the fact that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a practice of giving broad-based options to everybody in the company.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all those great stories about the chef at Google who got rich</p>
<p>and the secretaries at Microsoft who got rich.</p>
<p>And that is a beautiful thing about the tech ecosystem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>You never and you never hear about that when all the press is doing is writing stories</p>
<p>about greedy VCs and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>They talk about VC, but they don&rsquo;t bring up the point that in these non-VC companies,</p>
<p>the employees never end up with anything.</p>
<p>Someone who came from nothing can afford a beautiful home and have their</p>
<p>life taken care of forever because they work really hard at a great company that worked out.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the most common story.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s never reported.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And by the way, look, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with bootstrapping your company.</p>
<p>So congrats to this MailChimp founder for doing it.</p>
<p>I mean, certainly, you know, like as an investor, I have no desire.</p>
<p>Just explain what bootstrapping is, Sax.</p>
<p>Bootstrapping is just when you don&rsquo;t raise outside money.</p>
<p>And he did it himself.</p>
<p>And he basically funded profits.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He funded the company with the profits, which is just amazing.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing about that is he did this.</p>
<p>He started the company back in 2001 at the Nadir after the dotcom crash.</p>
<p>And there was very little money going into new startups back then.</p>
<p>And he managed to create this.</p>
<p>So kudos to him.</p>
<p>But the environment now is very different.</p>
<p>If you look at the amount of funding that goes into startups, I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s now in the hundreds of billions every year.</p>
<p>And so if you have this mentality of I&rsquo;m going to bootstrap it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably going to lose to a competitor who&rsquo;s simply willing to</p>
<p>raise money and pursue that same idea with more funding.</p>
<p>Now, look, I&rsquo;m not in the business of pushing money on people who don&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying realistically, the times are different now.</p>
<p>If you can bootstrap a business, great, go for it.</p>
<p>But I do think that if you&rsquo;re in competition with someone who can raise VC money,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Hard to compete yourself.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What about AOC, what she wore to the Met Gala?</p>
<p>She wore a tax the rich dress to the Met Gala.</p>
<p>Dave Portnoy had the best tweet about this,</p>
<p>which is she&rsquo;s about to go have the best night of her life,</p>
<p>parting her ass off with all these rich people.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s wearing this tax the rich.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s total hypocrisy.</p>
<p>This is classic socialism where they do this virtue signaling while being friends</p>
<p>and hanging out with the people, the owners of capital they&rsquo;re purporting to deride.</p>
<p>And frankly, it&rsquo;s just like the mass things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got the servant class working at the Met Gala wearing masks,</p>
<p>while all the guests of the gala don&rsquo;t have to wear a mask.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s completely hypocritical.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like Newsom all over again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Newsom all over again.</p>
<p>She also drops some merch.</p>
<p>You can buy a tax the rich.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an official AOC team shop.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes it the most lonesome.</p>
<p>She goes to the thing and now she&rsquo;s selling $58 sweaters, sweatshirts.</p>
<p>A $58 sweatshirt, a $28 dad hat, a $10 sticker pack, a $27 tote bag and a $27 mug.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a dad hat?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a hat for dads, like for us, you know?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, tax the rich dad hat.</p>
<p>Tax the rich, yeah.</p>
<p>Wow, I didn&rsquo;t know dad hat was a category.</p>
<p>I know dad jokes and dad bods.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never saw a dad hat.</p>
<p>Dad hat.</p>
<p>Fantastic, fantastic.</p>
<p>Yeah, I thought it was kind of gross.</p>
<p>Is it wrong to buy some of this?</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s kind of cool, actually.</p>
<p>I mean, the tax the rich hat is pretty funny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>Oh my God, if you were a tax the hat.</p>
<p>The sweatshirt.</p>
<p>I think the best thing is if I bought this sweatshirt and wore it around.</p>
<p>Wear it on CNBC, your next scene.</p>
<p>If you wear a tax the rich hat on CNBC, that would be peak Chamath.</p>
<p>I think that would be peak.</p>
<p>Oh my God, that&rsquo;d be great.</p>
<p>Get assigned by.</p>
<p>All right, anybody got any plugs?</p>
<p>Anybody have plugs?</p>
<p>The craziest thing about that Dave Portnoy tweet was that it got fact-checked.</p>
<p>Can you believe that?</p>
<p>It got fact-checked.</p>
<p>I mean, it was just mind-blowing that this is what.</p>
<p>When you say fact-check, they put a fact-checking.</p>
<p>They put a warning label on it.</p>
<p>Oh God.</p>
<p>So another one.</p>
<p>Warning liberals and socialists at Twitter don&rsquo;t agree with this tweet.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>No, exactly.</p>
<p>Warning somebody in the out crowd.</p>
<p>Dave Portnoy is criticizing somebody in the in crowd that by definition.</p>
<p>Portnoy definitely gets a seat at All In Summit, right?</p>
<p>He definitely gets a seat.</p>
<p>Is the ivermectin fake story from Rachel Maddow?</p>
<p>Is that fact-checked or no?</p>
<p>She posted some update or other begrudgingly presenting other information.</p>
<p>But I mean, the story should have been completely retracted and it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just curious whether there&rsquo;s a fact-check double standard.</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s absolutely there is no fact-check on that.</p>
<p>For some reason, the Rachel Maddow tweets went on fact-checked.</p>
<p>As far as I know, they&rsquo;re still on fact-checked.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>You should wear the rich hat and then get your buy the Hamptons shirt.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been wearing those on your neck.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>What a great combo.</p>
<p>Can I show you guys a great piece of merch?</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be back in a sec.</p>
<p>But can I just say, I don&rsquo;t look good in hats.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s merch for the beep app.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t look good in hats.</p>
<p>No, you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve wanted to wear a hat for a long time, but it just doesn&rsquo;t look good on me.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see his merch.</p>
<p>This is my favorite piece of merch.</p>
<p>Which is somebody made a hoodie.</p>
<p>Oh, besties.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fabulous.</p>
<p>Absolutely great.</p>
<p>Wait, can we just say, by the way, there&rsquo;s a person that did make a besties merch site.</p>
<p>None of us knows who he is, but there&rsquo;s an incredible thing that he tweeted at us,</p>
<p>right, J Cal, which is he&rsquo;s paying his way through college.</p>
<p>Yeah, he puts a note into it.</p>
<p>He told me he made like five grand over the summer.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so, you know, he&rsquo;s probably making like 30 grand a year off of merch.</p>
<p>If anybody&rsquo;s interested in some besties merch, we don&rsquo;t make a single dime from it,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a young, hardworking dude paying his way through school.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Bestie Apparel.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s Bestie Apparel, right?</p>
<p>Bestie Apparel.</p>
<p>BestieApparel.com.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really want to encourage too many people to go crazy doing this,</p>
<p>but this is our guy, I guess.</p>
<p>And I mean, good for him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s paying his way through school.</p>
<p>Good for him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I think they did, you know, the shirts that people wore on their all-in bar crawl</p>
<p>came from that.</p>
<p>But I really want to do the all-in summer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m buying this Tax the Rich sweatshirt, boys, and the T-shirt, and the sticker pack.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going for all of it.</p>
<p>You got me, AOC.</p>
<p>You got me on the hook.</p>
<p>Do they have a men&rsquo;s bikini with Tax the Rich on the backside for you?</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I would buy that.</p>
<p>For when we&rsquo;re in Italy?</p>
<p>I would buy that.</p>
<p>We can ‚Äì how about we get matching Speedos when we do our walk?</p>
<p>I always threaten to buy a Speedo.</p>
<p>She always says, well, you could ‚Äì</p>
<p>We have to buy Speedos next time we&rsquo;re in Italy.</p>
<p>She won&rsquo;t let me.</p>
<p>And we have to do our bestie walk from pier to pier on the beaches of Italy in a Speedo.</p>
<p>Can you imagine if that image got leaked of us in Speedos?</p>
<p>I did a bestie walk with Sax.</p>
<p>All right, boys.</p>
<p>I got to go.</p>
<p>I got to eat lunch.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Love you, besties.</p>
<p>Love you, guys.</p>
<p>Take care.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my dog taking a notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this, like, sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the B.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a B.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a B.</p>
<p>B?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
