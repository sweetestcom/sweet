    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, I have the pleasure of introducing Dr. Craig Heller</p>
<p>as my guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>Dr. Heller is a professor of biology</p>
<p>and neurosciences at Stanford.</p>
<p>His laboratory works on a range of topics,</p>
<p>including thermal regulation,</p>
<p>Down syndrome, and circadian rhythms.</p>
<p>Today, we talk about thermal regulation,</p>
<p>how the body heats and cools itself</p>
<p>and maintains what we call homeostasis,</p>
<p>which is an equilibrium of processes</p>
<p>that keeps our neurons healthy,</p>
<p>our organs functioning well.</p>
<p>And as Dr. Heller teaches us,</p>
<p>thermal regulation can be leveraged</p>
<p>in order to greatly increase our performance in athletics</p>
<p>and mental performance as well.</p>
<p>Learning to control your core body temperature</p>
<p>is one of the most,</p>
<p>if not the most powerful thing that you can do</p>
<p>to optimize mental and physical performance,</p>
<p>regardless of the environment that you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>He also dispels many common myths</p>
<p>about heating and cooling the body,</p>
<p>including the idea that putting a cold pack</p>
<p>on your head or neck is the optimal way</p>
<p>to cool down quickly.</p>
<p>And in fact, as Dr. Heller tells us,</p>
<p>it actually can be counterproductive</p>
<p>and lead to hyperthermia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating conversation</p>
<p>from which I learned a tremendous amount of new information</p>
<p>and we didn&rsquo;t even get into the other</p>
<p>incredibly interesting work that Dr. Heller does</p>
<p>on Down syndrome and circadian rhythms and sleep.</p>
<p>So we hope to have him back in the future</p>
<p>to discuss those topics.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ll soon see, Dr. Heller is a wealth of knowledge</p>
<p>on all things, human physiology,</p>
<p>biology and human performance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise then that he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>chair of the biology department at Stanford for many years,</p>
<p>as well as director of the human biology program.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in human biology</p>
<p>and how to improve your performance</p>
<p>in any context or setting, athletic or otherwise,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll very much enjoy today&rsquo;s conversation.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects of our brain</p>
<p>and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3</p>
<p>and K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need</p>
<p>and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase, they&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three minute quiz and Thesis will send you</p>
<p>four different formulas to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages that allow you</p>
<p>to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way that&rsquo;s really systematic</p>
<p>and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. Craig Heller.</p>
<p>Great to have you here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to be here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time coming.</p>
<p>I know that I and many people have a lot of questions</p>
<p>about the use of cold.</p>
<p>So one of the things that&rsquo;s happened in recent years</p>
<p>is that for many reasons,</p>
<p>people have become interested in things</p>
<p>like taking cold showers and taking ice baths</p>
<p>for many different purposes.</p>
<p>Sometimes this is introduced</p>
<p>as just a general health tonic,</p>
<p>but other times people get specific</p>
<p>about how it can improve resilience</p>
<p>or it can improve one&rsquo;s metabolism.</p>
<p>Could you just tell me a little bit about what happens</p>
<p>when I get into a cold shower or an ice bath?</p>
<p>What are some of the basic responses</p>
<p>at the level of metabolism?</p>
<p>Obviously, psychologically, we don&rsquo;t know exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll vary from person to person,</p>
<p>but what happens when I submerge myself into an ice bath</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;ve never done it before?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, you get a tremendous shock.</p>
<p>And what that&rsquo;s going to translate into</p>
<p>is a bit of a shot of adrenaline.</p>
<p>And I think this is really the so-called benefit,</p>
<p>but I wouldn&rsquo;t call it a benefit, of the cryochambers.</p>
<p>You go into a cryochamber and it&rsquo;s a shock,</p>
<p>so you get a shot of adrenaline.</p>
<p>So sure, you&rsquo;re gonna feel different when you come out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had a shot of adrenaline,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily translate into any benefit</p>
<p>in terms of your physiology, your performance, and so forth.</p>
<p>Now, if you take a cold bath or a cold shower,</p>
<p>a couple of things are happening.</p>
<p>One is you&rsquo;re going to stimulate vasoconstriction.</p>
<p>So if anything, it&rsquo;s going to make it</p>
<p>a little bit more difficult for your body</p>
<p>to get rid of heat because you&rsquo;re shutting off</p>
<p>your avenues of heat loss.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a true cold bath,</p>
<p>the overall surface area of your body is so great</p>
<p>that it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you vasoconstricted,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still going to lose heat.</p>
<p>Okay, so vasoconstriction, the constriction of,</p>
<p>is it capillaries, vessels, and arteries all constrict</p>
<p>or just one or two?</p>
<p>Well, this is an area of controversy.</p>
<p>In general, when people talk of vasoconstriction,</p>
<p>they talk of the overall skin surface, and that is not true.</p>
<p>The primary sites of heat loss,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re going to get into, are the palms of your hands,</p>
<p>the soles of your feet, and the upper part of your face.</p>
<p>And the reason these are avenues for heat loss</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re underlain by special blood vessels.</p>
<p>And these blood vessels are able to shunt the blood</p>
<p>from the arteries, which are coming from the heart,</p>
<p>directly to the veins, which are returning to the heart</p>
<p>and bypassing the capillaries,</p>
<p>which are the nutritive vessels, but high resistance.</p>
<p>So you can tell when you shake someone&rsquo;s hand</p>
<p>what his or her thermal status is.</p>
<p>The hand&rsquo;s hot or it&rsquo;s cold.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s part of the reason</p>
<p>why humans evolved this practice of shaking hands?</p>
<p>Assessing each other&rsquo;s level of anxiety.</p>
<p>We all know that a limp handshake</p>
<p>is pretty indicative of something,</p>
<p>and a firm handshake is indicative of something,</p>
<p>as is the crushing handshake, for that matter.</p>
<p>Yeah, I really don&rsquo;t know what the evolutionary origin</p>
<p>of handshaking is other than to get your hand</p>
<p>away from your weapon, perhaps.</p>
<p>Right, a couple of questions</p>
<p>before we get into these specialized vascular compartments</p>
<p>on the soles, the palms, and the upper face.</p>
<p>You mentioned whole body immersion,</p>
<p>like into an ice bath or very cold water up to the neck,</p>
<p>versus a cold shower.</p>
<p>Is there something fundamentally different about those two,</p>
<p>besides the fact that they both provide</p>
<p>this release of adrenaline?</p>
<p>Is there anything that&rsquo;s really important to understand</p>
<p>about the difference in the physiological response</p>
<p>provoked by cold shower versus immersion in cold?</p>
<p>Well, there are differences that are more physical</p>
<p>than anything else.</p>
<p>So if you are in a cold bath and you&rsquo;re still,</p>
<p>you develop a boundary layer.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a shower, you can&rsquo;t develop a boundary layer.</p>
<p>Could you explain what a boundary layer is?</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s best to explain it in terms of a hot bath,</p>
<p>because everybody&rsquo;s experienced that.</p>
<p>You get into a hot bath, and oh my God,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hot, almost painful.</p>
<p>And then you sit down,</p>
<p>and eventually it doesn&rsquo;t feel so hot anymore,</p>
<p>because the still water, which is close to your skin,</p>
<p>is coming into equilibrium with your skin.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like having a blanket on you,</p>
<p>or an insulator on you.</p>
<p>And then if you move around,</p>
<p>you disturb that still water layer,</p>
<p>you feel the hot temperature again.</p>
<p>I see, so if I were to get into a cold ice bath,</p>
<p>or a very cold body of water of some kind and stay still,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d likely feel warmer, at least until I start-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to be losing as much heat.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>If you flail around, then you&rsquo;re going to lose more heat.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>But I think getting back to your original question</p>
<p>about benefits, you have to keep in mind</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re talking about aerobic activity</p>
<p>or anaerobic activity,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re referring to performance and exercise and so forth.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re doing aerobic activity</p>
<p>that you can sustain for a long time,</p>
<p>your production of heat is rising gradually</p>
<p>and is being distributed throughout your body.</p>
<p>So eventually your body temperature</p>
<p>is going to come up to a level</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to impair your performance.</p>
<p>So the benefit of a cold bath or a cold shower</p>
<p>before aerobic activity is that you increase</p>
<p>the capacity of your body mass to absorb that excess heat.</p>
<p>I see, so could you say that in a rough sense</p>
<p>that a protocol that one might use</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re going to head out for a long run,</p>
<p>even on a reasonably warm day, not super hot,</p>
<p>or maybe it is super hot,</p>
<p>would be to take a cool shower before they go run.</p>
<p>Would that be beneficial?</p>
<p>Sure, it&rsquo;ll take them longer to get to the sweat point</p>
<p>and to heat up.</p>
<p>And what will that translate to</p>
<p>in terms of a performance benefit?</p>
<p>Well, it could increase your speed,</p>
<p>or it depends on how you use that benefit.</p>
<p>Some people are pacers.</p>
<p>They will go at the same pace and then they will go farther</p>
<p>or some people are, I want to say, pacers and regulators.</p>
<p>And no, no, pacers or forcers,</p>
<p>they will take that advantage</p>
<p>and use it up as fast as they can.</p>
<p>So they will go faster, but not necessarily farther.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>As far as I know, not many athletes,</p>
<p>at least not the ones that I know,</p>
<p>are getting into cool bodies of water,</p>
<p>taking cold showers before they head out to train,</p>
<p>but it sounds like there could be</p>
<p>a real performance benefit there.</p>
<p>It could be a benefit.</p>
<p>I know we&rsquo;re going to talk about our technology for cooling,</p>
<p>but at one point, I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re using it now,</p>
<p>but our cross country team,</p>
<p>when they would go to compete in a very hot place,</p>
<p>they would do their warmup exercises, their stretching,</p>
<p>then they would extract heat</p>
<p>before the beginning of the race.</p>
<p>So I like to think of it as you have greater scope</p>
<p>for heat absorption.</p>
<p>Interesting, about how long would one need to take</p>
<p>one of these showers or cold immersions</p>
<p>before heading out for a run?</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, we don&rsquo;t have to get into details</p>
<p>because everyone&rsquo;s performance level and regimen</p>
<p>is going to be different,</p>
<p>where they live is going to be different, et cetera.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as long as you think, it&rsquo;s minutes.</p>
<p>Couple minutes.</p>
<p>Yeah, because what&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>is as your core temperature goes down,</p>
<p>you will eventually shut off your heat loss</p>
<p>and that keeps it from going below normal.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve warmed up and your temperature has risen</p>
<p>by half a degree, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t take more than a few minutes</p>
<p>to extract that heat if you&rsquo;re vasodilated.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>And what about for the anaerobic athlete,</p>
<p>the strength athlete?</p>
<p>Right, for the anaerobic athlete,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say they&rsquo;re doing several sets</p>
<p>and how many reps, whatever they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>their core temperature is not going to rise that fast</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s only certain muscles which are being used,</p>
<p>but the temperature of those muscles will go up.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a local effect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a local effect, right.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say, for sake of today, maybe for this discussion,</p>
<p>if we assume that the basic workout,</p>
<p>even though people do variation on this,</p>
<p>is five sets of five or 10 sets of 10.</p>
<p>So for those listening, it would be five sets of 10,</p>
<p>of five repetitions or 10 sets of 10 repetitions,</p>
<p>10 by 10, five by five, yeah.</p>
<p>So if somebody, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>is doing a large body compound movement,</p>
<p>like barbell squats,</p>
<p>where there are a lot of large body movements,</p>
<p>hip hinging, et cetera.</p>
<p>But for instance, the biceps are not,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re involved, but more or less indirectly.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So the effect is going to be to heat up the quadriceps,</p>
<p>heat up the hamstrings, heat up the glutes,</p>
<p>this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Right. I see.</p>
<p>And then during rest, that heat will leave the muscle,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not fast.</p>
<p>And certainly the heat can&rsquo;t leave the muscle very fast</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re working out,</p>
<p>because when the muscle contracts,</p>
<p>it squeezes the blood vessels.</p>
<p>And the only way heat gets out of a muscle is in the blood.</p>
<p>And your muscle metabolism can go up 50 or 60 fold</p>
<p>during anaerobic activity.</p>
<p>That means the heat production in the muscle</p>
<p>goes up 50 or 60 fold.</p>
<p>The blood flow to that muscle cannot go up 50 or 60 fold.</p>
<p>So you literally have the capacity to cook your muscles.</p>
<p>So this is probably an appropriate time</p>
<p>to just mention briefly</p>
<p>what the underlying mechanism of this is.</p>
<p>Could you just, we will return to the specifics</p>
<p>of what one can do to mitigate this heating up,</p>
<p>but could you just explain the relationship</p>
<p>between energy production, ATP, and pyruvate kinase,</p>
<p>and the role of heat there?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t get something for nothing.</p>
<p>So like a steam engine,</p>
<p>most of the energy in our food is lost as heat.</p>
<p>So we are roughly about 20% efficient.</p>
<p>So of the energy that we take in in our food,</p>
<p>about 20% of that can go into doing work,</p>
<p>and the rest of it is lost as heat.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;re mammals.</p>
<p>We use that heat to keep our body temperature</p>
<p>considerably above the environment.</p>
<p>But if you raise body temperature a few degrees higher,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in trouble.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hyperthermia.</p>
<p>So individual muscles can reach hyperthermic limits</p>
<p>before you might experience it in the whole body.</p>
<p>So to keep you from damaging your muscle by hyperthermia,</p>
<p>we have fail-safe mechanisms.</p>
<p>And one of those fail-safe mechanisms is an enzyme,</p>
<p>which is critical for getting fuel,</p>
<p>in other words, the results of metabolism of glucose,</p>
<p>getting that fuel into the mitochondria,</p>
<p>which is making our major coinage of energy exchange, ATP.</p>
<p>So that particular enzyme is temperature sensitive.</p>
<p>So when the muscle temperature gets above 39 or 39.5,</p>
<p>it shuts off.</p>
<p>And that essentially shuts off the fuel supply</p>
<p>to the mitochondria.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you cannot do one more rep.</p>
<p>So failure, could we say that one component</p>
<p>of muscular failure is overheating of the muscle locally?</p>
<p>There are probably other things too.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, if you lack oxygen.</p>
<p>But our oxygen delivery is pretty good to the muscle.</p>
<p>If you run out of glucose, yeah, that&rsquo;s going to impair you.</p>
<p>But the most immediate impairment of muscle activity,</p>
<p>muscle fatigue, in other words,</p>
<p>is the rise in temperature of the muscle.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I want to talk about how that muscle fails locally,</p>
<p>but I have this burning question in my mind</p>
<p>that I cannot seem to answer for myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping you can answer it for me.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m doing five sets of five with squats.</p>
<p>I hit muscular failure at a given weight.</p>
<p>And according to what I now know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s my quadriceps and the muscles associated</p>
<p>with the squat that have failed</p>
<p>because of this heat triggering,</p>
<p>this mechanism triggered by heat that shuts off the muscle.</p>
<p>But my biceps are nice and cool.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re telling me.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not doing too much work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only indirect work.</p>
<p>So why is it that I can&rsquo;t set the bar down in the squat rack,</p>
<p>walk over and do barbell curls</p>
<p>with the same intensity that I could</p>
<p>if I were to do those barbell curls fresh,</p>
<p>not having done anything prior?</p>
<p>Well, you will still have a fatigue curve</p>
<p>with your upper body, okay?</p>
<p>And that will be influenced by any rise in temperature</p>
<p>that has been generated by your lower body exercise.</p>
<p>So temperature in both cases is the limiting factor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one limiting factor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one limiting factor.</p>
<p>I find that amazing.</p>
<p>I find that amazing because I always thought naively</p>
<p>that the reason muscles fail</p>
<p>is because we, quote,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the strength to do another repetition</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s that you lack glycogen</p>
<p>or some ability to access that glycogen.</p>
<p>But of course we still have glycogen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s naive for me to think that</p>
<p>because if I wait three minutes and go back,</p>
<p>I can do those repetitions again.</p>
<p>So the glycogen wasn&rsquo;t restored in that three minutes.</p>
<p>Obviously it was there.</p>
<p>So I realized there might be other mechanisms involved.</p>
<p>Sounds like heat is, if not the dominant mechanism</p>
<p>that prevents more work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a quick one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fast one.</p>
<p>So it can happen with,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you are a really experienced weightlifter, okay?</p>
<p>You may be doing very, very high weights</p>
<p>with sets of five or six.</p>
<p>Yeah, to be clear for the audience,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing very high weights for the sets of five.</p>
<p>Not particularly strong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not super weak, but I&rsquo;m not particularly strong.</p>
<p>But Craig&rsquo;s referring in the general sense to you.</p>
<p>So why is it that if I finish a set of squats,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t simply cool off my quadriceps</p>
<p>by throwing a nice cool towel on my quadriceps?</p>
<p>Why is that not the best way to go about it?</p>
<p>Because your body surface is a very good insulator, okay?</p>
<p>We think we don&rsquo;t have fur</p>
<p>and therefore we&rsquo;re not insulated.</p>
<p>But the skin, the fascia, the muscles underneath,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re all very good insulators.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I said earlier</p>
<p>that the way the heat gets out of the muscle is in the blood.</p>
<p>So I want to step through a couple other portals</p>
<p>by which one might think that heating and cooling</p>
<p>would be ideal and then get back to these-</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Specialized surfaces on the hands, the feet, and the face.</p>
<p>So if throwing a cold towel or even ice cold towel</p>
<p>on my quadriceps isn&rsquo;t going to work</p>
<p>or standing in front of the fan</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m insulated from that cool,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t cool off my blood fast enough.</p>
<p>What about drinking 16 ounces of ice water?</p>
<p>Sure, you can do that,</p>
<p>but you can calculate how much heat that can absorb.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t continue drinking liters of ice water.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to dilute your blood and have other problems.</p>
<p>But yes, it&rsquo;ll help.</p>
<p>Sure, it will help.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t have the full capacity you will need.</p>
<p>What about an ice pack to the back of my neck</p>
<p>or to my head or squeezing the cold sponge over the head?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m deliberately moving through these options</p>
<p>because these are the ones that we see most often.</p>
<p>We were actually just watching</p>
<p>the Olympic track and field trials last night up in Oregon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge track and field fan.</p>
<p>And there were a lot of sponges on the backs of necks</p>
<p>before and between and after events.</p>
<p>And how good is that or how poor is that as a strategy?</p>
<p>Since now we know that being overheated locally</p>
<p>and systemically throughout the body</p>
<p>is a serious limiting factor on performance.</p>
<p>Well, you have to understand something</p>
<p>about our thermal regulatory system.</p>
<p>We have a thermostat,</p>
<p>just like you have a thermostat in your house.</p>
<p>And that thermostat is in the brain, okay?</p>
<p>Do we know the specific site?</p>
<p>Yes. Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the preoptic anterior hypothalamus.</p>
<p>It does many things in terms of physiological regulation,</p>
<p>but it serves as a thermostat.</p>
<p>Now that thermostat has to have information.</p>
<p>It has to have input.</p>
<p>Where does that input come from?</p>
<p>It comes from our overall body surface</p>
<p>where we sense temperature, okay?</p>
<p>So one of the things that can happen when you&rsquo;re overheated</p>
<p>is that you can send in a cold stimulus to your thermostat.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sort of like wanting to cool your house</p>
<p>by putting a wet washcloth over your thermostat.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s doing the wrong thing.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve actually had experiences</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;ve had people exercising, getting overheated,</p>
<p>and then cooling the body surface.</p>
<p>And they say, it feels great.</p>
<p>This is fantastic.</p>
<p>And their core temperature&rsquo;s going up.</p>
<p>Well, I think this is such an important point.</p>
<p>First of all, I was weaned in a laboratory</p>
<p>where there were always battles</p>
<p>over the temperature in the lab.</p>
<p>So people were always putting ice packs on thermostats</p>
<p>or putting fans towards thermostats</p>
<p>and trying to play this game.</p>
<p>Good to know we were all being foolish,</p>
<p>even though we were neurobiologists.</p>
<p>Putting a cold towel over my torso</p>
<p>or putting ice on the back of my upper back,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying could actually heat up my core.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll at least decrease your heat loss,</p>
<p>your rate of heat loss.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to raise the issue a little later, I know,</p>
<p>and that is our natural portals for heat loss.</p>
<p>So you can think of the natural portals for heat loss</p>
<p>as our air conditioners, okay?</p>
<p>The thermostat&rsquo;s in the brain</p>
<p>and the information to the thermostat</p>
<p>is coming from the overall body surface.</p>
<p>So what can happen if you, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>cool the torso with an ice vest,</p>
<p>you can actually cause a vasoconstriction of your portals,</p>
<p>your heat loss portals.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what impairs the rate at which you&rsquo;re losing.</p>
<p>It feels good.</p>
<p>Now, back to the head.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>The major blood flow to the brain</p>
<p>comes up four arteries through the neck.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the carotid arteries</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s the vertebral arteries.</p>
<p>So when you put a cold towel around the neck,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be putting a cold stimulus into the brain.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s great for protecting the brain.</p>
<p>You want to protect the brain,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also going to make you feel cooler than you are.</p>
<p>So you will think you&rsquo;re ready to go again quickly</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve just essentially cooled the thermostat.</p>
<p>This is an important point.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of interest nowadays</p>
<p>in people doing marathons</p>
<p>and there are even some people do these ultras,</p>
<p>ultra running, which I guess</p>
<p>is everything longer than a marathon</p>
<p>and go last man standing,</p>
<p>last man, last woman standing kind of things.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying that if somebody is hyperthermic,</p>
<p>they could trick themselves into subjectively thinking</p>
<p>that they are cooling off by putting a cool towel</p>
<p>and that they can go further, but their brain could cook.</p>
<p>Well, if they stop the cooling,</p>
<p>then that hot blood from the body core</p>
<p>is going to go to the brain.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a bit of a tangent,</p>
<p>but many people report after long bouts of exercise</p>
<p>or even just very intense bouts of exercise,</p>
<p>feeling a kind of brain fog or mental fatigue.</p>
<p>I assumed that that was due</p>
<p>to lowered brain oxygenation post-exercise,</p>
<p>but is it possible that there are some post-exercise effects</p>
<p>on heating and cooling of the brain</p>
<p>that might impact cognition</p>
<p>or I should say negatively impact cognition?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly possible because we know</p>
<p>that a rise in temperature decreases cognitive capacity.</p>
<p>I mean, you can experience that yourself.</p>
<p>You can get on a treadmill and follow your temperature</p>
<p>and then just do a simple activity</p>
<p>like adding and subtracting.</p>
<p>You get to about 39 degrees,</p>
<p>so you can&rsquo;t do that anymore.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just calculate</p>
<p>how long you&rsquo;ve been on the treadmill.</p>
<p>So that the phrase cool, calm, and collected is-</p>
<p>Cool, calm, and collected.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the goal in all pursuits.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So I want to talk about these portals</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve mentioned them a few times.</p>
<p>Before I ask about what the portals are exactly</p>
<p>and how they work</p>
<p>and how they can be leveraged for performance,</p>
<p>I just, there&rsquo;s a question</p>
<p>that my neurobiologist self can&rsquo;t resist but ask.</p>
<p>We have this thermostat</p>
<p>in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>which is interesting to me that the medial preoptic area</p>
<p>is also one that&rsquo;s known to be sexually dimorphic</p>
<p>depending on testosterone exposure early in life, et cetera.</p>
<p>Although people should just note</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not actually testosterone</p>
<p>that creates these sexual dimorphisms, these difference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually testosterone converted into estrogen.</p>
<p>Estrogen is the effector, which is fascinating.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we&rsquo;ve got this area that acts as a thermostat.</p>
<p>And you said it&rsquo;s collecting information</p>
<p>from the whole body.</p>
<p>Does that mean that there are pathways</p>
<p>as the neuroscientists like you and I refer to them</p>
<p>as these afferent or input pathways</p>
<p>from the body to the preoptic area?</p>
<p>Is there a map of our body in the preoptic area?</p>
<p>Because I have to imagine</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t have the information</p>
<p>just coming from the left shoulder, just from the right toe.</p>
<p>It sounds like you need a pretty,</p>
<p>probably a pretty crude map,</p>
<p>but that you need a complete map of the body surface there.</p>
<p>Well, you don&rsquo;t need a complete map in the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>I mean, that thermal afferent information that you mentioned,</p>
<p>it also goes to the somatosensory cortex.</p>
<p>So you know if an ice cube has touched you on the back,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily translate</p>
<p>into a change in, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re shivering or sweating.</p>
<p>So the information that&rsquo;s going to the hypothalamus</p>
<p>is more integrated representation of body temperature.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of an average of what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>across the body. It&rsquo;s an average.</p>
<p>So if I were to, let&rsquo;s say I get hot on a hot day</p>
<p>and popsicles when we were in summer camp,</p>
<p>I went to a sports camp near here actually,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d run around like crazy</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;d get into the shade if we could,</p>
<p>but we were, you know, popsicles.</p>
<p>It was like a popsicle. Brain freeze.</p>
<p>Or the kids were putting ice cubes down each other&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, shirts or something.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s an average</p>
<p>because other parts of the body aren&rsquo;t exposed.</p>
<p>The mouth is exposed to the ice in the popsicle case</p>
<p>or the cold cubes or in the hands.</p>
<p>As you said, it feels really good.</p>
<p>It feels good, yeah.</p>
<p>But it sounds like it feels deceptively good</p>
<p>because in reality, it could still be quite warm internally.</p>
<p>Absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>You can feel great</p>
<p>and have a dangerously hyperthermic temperature.</p>
<p>But I should say that when you get into the danger zone,</p>
<p>things get bad fast.</p>
<p>What are some of the symptoms</p>
<p>that people could be on the lookout for, for hyperthermia?</p>
<p>Essentially, it&rsquo;s almost ironic</p>
<p>that if individuals are transitioning into heat stroke,</p>
<p>they actually vasoconstrict and they stop sweating.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a pathological situation.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t begin to explain it.</p>
<p>But essentially, you are just feeling exhausted.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re feeling miserable.</p>
<p>The heart rate is very high.</p>
<p>Your heart rate goes up as your core temperature goes up,</p>
<p>called cardiac drift.</p>
<p>So you just feel rotten.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s why, since it&rsquo;s not a danger signal</p>
<p>that you can translate immediately into,</p>
<p>nope, I&rsquo;m going into heat stroke,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why people can overcome their bad feeling</p>
<p>with motivation to continue going, to work harder.</p>
<p>So there have been a number of high-profile athletic deaths</p>
<p>due to heat stroke that were during practice,</p>
<p>not in competition when people are really trying to do it,</p>
<p>but in practice,</p>
<p>which shows they were just motivated to push.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about these magnificent portals</p>
<p>that not just humans,</p>
<p>but other animals, mammals are equipped with.</p>
<p>So if putting cold on the neck or on the head</p>
<p>or on the torso is not optimal, what is optimal?</p>
<p>And maybe walk us through a theory</p>
<p>as to why we would have these portals located where they are</p>
<p>and then we can talk about</p>
<p>how one might leverage them for performance.</p>
<p>Okay, where the portals are are in the glabrous skin,</p>
<p>big word, okay?</p>
<p>Glabrous just means no hair.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the hairless skin.</p>
<p>You say, well, most of my body is without hair.</p>
<p>No, most of your body has hair follicles.</p>
<p>We are mammals.</p>
<p>Mammals have fur.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve lost the fur, but we still have those,</p>
<p>that hairy skin phenotype all over our body,</p>
<p>except for those skin surfaces</p>
<p>where our mammal relatives didn&rsquo;t have fur.</p>
<p>So the pads of the feet.</p>
<p>And for the primates, upper part of the face.</p>
<p>For rabbits, no portions of the ears,</p>
<p>the inner surface of the ears.</p>
<p>For bears, the tongue, bears have big tongues, huge tongues.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that either.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been that close to a bear yet.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had a licking match with a bear.</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>So anyway, our mammalian relatives can&rsquo;t lose heat</p>
<p>over their overall body surface.</p>
<p>So probably very early on in mammalian evolution,</p>
<p>they evolved these special blood vessels</p>
<p>in the limited surface areas that don&rsquo;t have fur.</p>
<p>And as I said, what these blood vessels are,</p>
<p>are shunts between the arteries and the veins.</p>
<p>Arteries and veins are both low resistance vessels.</p>
<p>So you can have high flow rate.</p>
<p>Capillaries, which normally are between arteries and veins,</p>
<p>are high resistance because they&rsquo;re very tiny, okay?</p>
<p>Is it fair to say that what I was taught</p>
<p>is that blood flows from arteries, then to capillaries,</p>
<p>and then to veins, and then back to the heart.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of like from the heart through arteries,</p>
<p>then through these little capillaries,</p>
<p>which are like little estuaries and streams,</p>
<p>and then to the veins back to the heart.</p>
<p>Is that generally true?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>So what I learned in basic physiology is still,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t get an F in your class.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Maybe a D or a C, but not an F.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s excellent.</p>
<p>Okay, and so you&rsquo;re saying that in this glabrous,</p>
<p>or beneath the glabrous skin.</p>
<p>There are these shunts.</p>
<p>And those go directly from arteries to veins.</p>
<p>So you skip the capillaries.</p>
<p>Yeah, I see.</p>
<p>And is it actually, as long as I say that in the skin,</p>
<p>you know, when I feel the pads of my hands,</p>
<p>how deep to the surface do these vessels reside?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re below the, obviously, the epidermis.</p>
<p>So if you are warm and you look at the palms of your hands,</p>
<p>they are fairly red.</p>
<p>The backs of your hands aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have these vessels in the backs of your hands.</p>
<p>Now, if you take a glass, like a water tumbler, right,</p>
<p>and you grab it, you can see if you squeeze a little bit,</p>
<p>the hand goes white.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve shut off that blood flow.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do that little home experiment.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re bicycling on a hot day,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to be grabbing your handlebars all the time.</p>
<p>You want to periodically.</p>
<p>Well, this is important.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re privy to some really amazing results</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to talk about,</p>
<p>but I actually heard you say this during this lecture</p>
<p>recently that Stanford held about human performance</p>
<p>that we were both part of.</p>
<p>And you mentioned this, that if you&rsquo;re cycling</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re working hard and you want to be able</p>
<p>to do more work, we now know why you want to remain cool</p>
<p>in order to continue to do work.</p>
<p>And if you get too warm, that&rsquo;s bad,</p>
<p>that gripping the handlebars too tightly</p>
<p>will actually limit your performance.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably also true on the Peloton</p>
<p>or any other kind of device,</p>
<p>or the skier or anything like that.</p>
<p>So loosen the grip, or if you safely can,</p>
<p>you want to actually expose your hands to the world.</p>
<p>Now, what about for people wearing gloves?</p>
<p>What about the, to me, that just seems crazy</p>
<p>based on everything you&rsquo;re telling me.</p>
<p>Well, gloves definitely impede heat loss from the hands,</p>
<p>just as socks impede heat loss from the feet, okay?</p>
<p>So if you want to maximize your heat loss,</p>
<p>you want to have as thin of protectors</p>
<p>as possible on your hands.</p>
<p>And of course the feet are more problematical</p>
<p>because you have to be using them in certain ways.</p>
<p>Some people run barefoot.</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s become somewhat popular.</p>
<p>It seems like it kind of came and went.</p>
<p>They had those toe shoes things,</p>
<p>but they looked so ridiculous</p>
<p>that I think most people just were willing</p>
<p>to take the performance hindrance of regular shoes.</p>
<p>Actually, we had a track coach here at Stanford</p>
<p>who for a while was famous for introducing</p>
<p>training without shoes, running.</p>
<p>And he thought it was because it changed</p>
<p>the posture of the runner.</p>
<p>And I think it was just due to the fact</p>
<p>that he was increasing the capacity</p>
<p>of his runners to lose heat.</p>
<p>Interesting, yeah.</p>
<p>So heating up at the level of the hands</p>
<p>obviously is going to hinder performance.</p>
<p>So if I can, how about with running?</p>
<p>I noticed I ran across the country briefly in high school</p>
<p>and not particularly well at that,</p>
<p>but that we were told to run as if we were holding</p>
<p>crackers in our fingers or something like very lightly</p>
<p>and to keep hands kind of loose.</p>
<p>So running like this would actually be</p>
<p>more beneficial performance than,</p>
<p>or gripping a phone,</p>
<p>which is probably what most people are doing nowadays.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>And I once, I&rsquo;ll tell you an experience I had once.</p>
<p>I was in Alaska in the winter</p>
<p>and I went out running</p>
<p>and I absentmindedly forgot gloves.</p>
<p>And I realized this after a short period running</p>
<p>because the backs of my hands were aching from the cold.</p>
<p>The palms of my hands were sweating and were hot.</p>
<p>Oh, amazing.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>So these compartments are a real thing.</p>
<p>And you mentioned the upper half of the face.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where our primate ancestors don&rsquo;t have fur.</p>
<p>And the bottoms of our feet.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just take a moment,</p>
<p>talk about some of the more amazing results</p>
<p>that have been associated with proper cooling</p>
<p>of these glabrous skin surfaces.</p>
<p>Let me introduce one more thing.</p>
<p>Because you asked earlier</p>
<p>about the pouring of water on the head.</p>
<p>One of the things which is not appreciated fully</p>
<p>is that the blood which is perfusing</p>
<p>these special blood vessels in the face,</p>
<p>above the beard line,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the non-hairy skin,</p>
<p>that blood then returns in the venous supply to the heart,</p>
<p>but it actually does it in a very strange way.</p>
<p>It actually goes through what are called,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m blocking on the name now.</p>
<p>Take your time.</p>
<p>These are blood vessels that go through the skull, okay?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the scalp bleeds a lot</p>
<p>if you cut the scalp.</p>
<p>And these blood vessels which are called,</p>
<p>I want to say emergent, but it&rsquo;s not emergent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a word that means leaving.</p>
<p>And these blood vessels were primarily thought</p>
<p>to be ways that blood is leaving the brain.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re overheated,</p>
<p>the direction of flow in those blood vessels reverses.</p>
<p>So the cool blood that&rsquo;s coming from your facial region</p>
<p>goes into that circulation</p>
<p>and actually is a cooling source for the brain.</p>
<p>So you can cool the brain.</p>
<p>You can have a cooling effect on the brain</p>
<p>by pouring water on your head.</p>
<p>Interesting, so that practice, which we,</p>
<p>at least for me, I most commonly associate</p>
<p>with combat sports where someone,</p>
<p>the fighter goes to their corner.</p>
<p>They usually sit down on a stool</p>
<p>unless they&rsquo;re trying to do some mental warfare</p>
<p>from the corner, in which case they don&rsquo;t even take a seat.</p>
<p>And their corner crew will squeeze a glove,</p>
<p>excuse me, a sponge full of cold water over them.</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;re saying is somewhat effective</p>
<p>in cooling the brain.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s one of the natural mechanisms</p>
<p>for cooling the brain.</p>
<p>I want to return to this at some point as well,</p>
<p>but is there any known benefit to cooling the brain</p>
<p>in terms of offsetting physical damage,</p>
<p>offsetting the negative effects of concussion?</p>
<p>Because one of the reasons why fighters</p>
<p>will often get a cold on the back,</p>
<p>a cold item on the back of the neck or on the head</p>
<p>is not just to cool them down,</p>
<p>but the theory is that it might offset</p>
<p>some of the damage of neurons.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t comment on that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware of those ideas, but they&rsquo;re controversial.</p>
<p>One of the things that you want to do</p>
<p>for injury to the brain is to decrease swelling.</p>
<p>And one of the ways that you decrease swelling</p>
<p>in many parts of the body is to cool.</p>
<p>It decreases inflammation, it decreases the blood flow.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a really interesting topic</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s something that should be investigated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of hard to investigate.</p>
<p>Yeah, interesting.</p>
<p>Okay, so I hear these stories and I&rsquo;ve seen the data,</p>
<p>so I believe the stories.</p>
<p>Maybe tell us a story about an observation</p>
<p>that your group has made with respect to anaerobic exercise</p>
<p>and proper cooling of these glabrous surfaces.</p>
<p>And we can talk about the technology.</p>
<p>Maybe give us the dips example first.</p>
<p>Dips, of course, I think most people are familiar with dips.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to, I guess, get down.</p>
<p>Raise and lower your body mass.</p>
<p>Yeah, raise and lower your body mass,</p>
<p>usually with your legs dangling down.</p>
<p>Sometimes people strong enough to attach a weight there</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll do, it&rsquo;s essentially</p>
<p>a compound upper body exercise.</p>
<p>One dip would not be particularly impressive</p>
<p>for most people.</p>
<p>100 would be very impressive.</p>
<p>20 would be impressive for some, et cetera.</p>
<p>What happens when a skilled athlete comes in</p>
<p>and does dips for multiple sets?</p>
<p>And then what happens when they cool properly</p>
<p>using the glabrous skin surfaces?</p>
<p>This was a story that occurred early on</p>
<p>in our investigations when we first made the discoveries</p>
<p>that cooling has a benefit to increase your work volume,</p>
<p>your capacity to do more reps, okay?</p>
<p>So the word got over, I think, to the 49ers camp.</p>
<p>And one of their players, Greg Clark,</p>
<p>who was a tight end at the time.</p>
<p>He had been tight end at Stanford.</p>
<p>He decided, or I don&rsquo;t know if he was asked or what,</p>
<p>to come over and check it out.</p>
<p>So Greg came over and we said, Greg, what are you good at?</p>
<p>What activity do you like to do?</p>
<p>He said, dips.</p>
<p>I can do a lot of dips.</p>
<p>I can do 40 dips in a first set</p>
<p>and I can probably do five sets.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a usual workout for me.</p>
<p>And we said, okay.</p>
<p>So he came over to the gym one day</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s exactly what he did.</p>
<p>He did 40 dips, the first set,</p>
<p>and then maybe 25 and 15 and down from there.</p>
<p>Do you recall roughly what kind of rest periods</p>
<p>he was taking between sets?</p>
<p>Yeah, we standardized the rest period to three minutes</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what we had set on for cooling</p>
<p>as the intervals.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good long rest period.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>Still a lot of dips.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s actually a longer rest period</p>
<p>than many people would prefer during workouts</p>
<p>Not me, I prefer to take as much rest as I possibly can.</p>
<p>So several days later he came back</p>
<p>and his first set he did, I think maybe 42,</p>
<p>a little bit better,</p>
<p>but now people were standing around watching.</p>
<p>So there was a little impetus there to show off.</p>
<p>So then his second set was, I don&rsquo;t remember the numbers,</p>
<p>but very much above the second set on the control day.</p>
<p>This was after we cooled his-</p>
<p>Okay, so when is he doing the cooling?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s sitting down and putting his hands</p>
<p>in the devices that we had built,</p>
<p>which were cooling the palms of his hands.</p>
<p>For how long does that cooling take?</p>
<p>Can he do it inside of a three minute rest period?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what we were doing.</p>
<p>We standardized the interval for resting or cooling</p>
<p>to three minutes.</p>
<p>Okay, but the point is he got to his fifth set</p>
<p>and all of the sets were above</p>
<p>what he had done on the previous day.</p>
<p>And he said, you know, I&rsquo;m not tired.</p>
<p>I can do another set.</p>
<p>And then I can do another set.</p>
<p>I can do another set.</p>
<p>I can do another set.</p>
<p>So from one day to two or three days later with cooling,</p>
<p>he doubled the total work volume.</p>
<p>He doubled the total number of dips.</p>
<p>By adding more sets and more repetitions to each set.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So then he kept coming back for four more weeks,</p>
<p>twice a week.</p>
<p>And by the end of that month, he was doing 300 dips.</p>
<p>Wow, so what percentage?</p>
<p>So he tripled.</p>
<p>He essentially tripled.</p>
<p>And so here&rsquo;s a professional athlete</p>
<p>at peak physical conditioning</p>
<p>and he triples what he can do.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>And in terms of his ability to recover,</p>
<p>was that explored or discussed at all?</p>
<p>Because my understanding is that</p>
<p>if we cause enough stress to a muscle</p>
<p>during anaerobic training,</p>
<p>we provide the stimulus for compensatory regrowth,</p>
<p>et cetera.</p>
<p>But if we do more work,</p>
<p>we essentially scale up the amount of recovery</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s needed or the recovery time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very curious about whether or not</p>
<p>he needed longer to recover</p>
<p>between these super performing workouts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>That was a major discovery,</p>
<p>which we didn&rsquo;t realize we were making at the time.</p>
<p>There is this phenomenon you&rsquo;re referring to</p>
<p>as delayed onset muscle soreness, DOMS.</p>
<p>And this is due to those little micro tears and so forth</p>
<p>that are happening as we extend our workout capacity,</p>
<p>volume, okay?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve had this experience so many times</p>
<p>that an athlete or anyone will come in to the lab</p>
<p>and they will exceed what their previous goals were,</p>
<p>their previous expectations.</p>
<p>And I can always see the words coming out of their mouth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be so sore tomorrow.</p>
<p>They never are.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve actually demonstrated that with a naive group.</p>
<p>We had a class, a physical conditioning class,</p>
<p>and we had half of them.</p>
<p>The first days of the class,</p>
<p>we had to establish their true capacity,</p>
<p>what they could do.</p>
<p>So these were pretty heavy workouts for these new recruits.</p>
<p>And we gave half of them the benefit of cooling</p>
<p>and the other half not.</p>
<p>And then we had them record their subjective levels</p>
<p>of delayed onset muscle soreness.</p>
<p>And those that were cooled</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have significant muscle soreness.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>And I know there are also published results</p>
<p>and we will provide links to some of these papers</p>
<p>for people seeing similar effects,</p>
<p>I should say similar performance enhancing effects</p>
<p>using bench presses or bench press or pushups</p>
<p>or other sorts of things.</p>
<p>Maybe you could give us an example</p>
<p>from the realm of endurance work or aerobic work,</p>
<p>running, cycling, things of that sort.</p>
<p>Well, one of the problems for us</p>
<p>is that our equipment now is not really portable.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s portable in the sense</p>
<p>you can carry it to the gym or to the football field.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not going to run with it.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not going to run with it, right.</p>
<p>Or equip a bicycle with it.</p>
<p>Although when are the cooling handles on bicycles coming?</p>
<p>Yeah, that would be good.</p>
<p>One itinerant activity is golfing</p>
<p>and people have put it on their golf carts</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re out.</p>
<p>Do people really heat up that much in golf?</p>
<p>They do.</p>
<p>Not to be disparaging of the golfers,</p>
<p>but the way I conceptualize golf,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a swing and then a walk</p>
<p>and then a cart ride and then a meal.</p>
<p>I probably just offended all the golfers out there.</p>
<p>Well, one time we were doing work</p>
<p>for the Department of Defense</p>
<p>and they wanted to check it out</p>
<p>whether or not what we were doing was really worthwhile.</p>
<p>So they sent out a team of special ops soldiers</p>
<p>to be our subjects and test it out.</p>
<p>They were here for a week.</p>
<p>So that was a fun week.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do some work with those guys.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hard driving guys.</p>
<p>They also know how to have fun.</p>
<p>But yeah, they definitely have,</p>
<p>if they have an off or a quit switch,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s buried deep within their nervous system.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t like to hit that quit switch.</p>
<p>So the guy who wrote the final report,</p>
<p>he gave an addendum to the report and he said,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;ll tell you this,</p>
<p>after I&rsquo;ve gotten home, it&rsquo;s added that technology.</p>
<p>They took the technology with them.</p>
<p>They wanted to keep it.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that sounds about right.</p>
<p>And using it, it has added 20 yards</p>
<p>to every club in my bag and that&rsquo;s no effing small deal.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s allowing people to hit further,</p>
<p>hit the golf ball further.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>All right, so for the golf players out there,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s the reward you get back from Craig</p>
<p>for all my little knocks on golf.</p>
<p>I actually, I don&rsquo;t have any knock on golf.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think about it as a sport</p>
<p>where heating up is a limiting factor.</p>
<p>So since they&rsquo;re getting more out of their drive,</p>
<p>what do you think&rsquo;s going on there?</p>
<p>Well, they can be heating up.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re wearing gloves, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re wearing gloves on a hot day and so forth.</p>
<p>But let me just tell you one more serious story</p>
<p>about golfers and that is individuals</p>
<p>with multiple sclerosis</p>
<p>are exceedingly temperature sensitive.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>So they may still be mobile,</p>
<p>but they have to stay in cool locations</p>
<p>and not increase their exercise to any great extent.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve had subjects that have,</p>
<p>with multiple sclerosis,</p>
<p>who have just essentially put the device on their golf cart</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re back out playing golf</p>
<p>in the middle of the summer.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Anything that allows people to have normal levels</p>
<p>of livelihood and recreation is great.</p>
<p>We always think about performance</p>
<p>as at these kind of like peak and elite levels</p>
<p>and pushing harder.</p>
<p>But yeah, anything that allows people</p>
<p>to be mobile and functional is great.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your favorite example of endurance?</p>
<p>And feel free to give us the extreme one</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll talk about averages</p>
<p>to make sure we&rsquo;re thorough</p>
<p>about averages versus exceptions.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t done a lot in the field.</p>
<p>I mean, outdoors.</p>
<p>Most of our endurance has been in a hot room</p>
<p>with treadmill work and so forth.</p>
<p>So the very first experiment we had,</p>
<p>I think maybe 18 subjects just off the street.</p>
<p>I mean, we just recruited people in the hallways,</p>
<p>come on in and do this.</p>
<p>And what we found is we could, for this group,</p>
<p>with one trial with and without cooling,</p>
<p>we could double their endurance walking on the treadmill,</p>
<p>walking uphill on the treadmill in the heat,</p>
<p>like maybe 40 degrees ambient temperature,</p>
<p>40 degrees centigrade.</p>
<p>So what does that experiment look like?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re having people walk on an incline.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really warm.</p>
<p>Some people are just going to hit the quit button</p>
<p>and say, I&rsquo;ve had enough and get off the treadmill.</p>
<p>With proper cooling.</p>
<p>When are they doing the cooling?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing it continuously.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Because in the laboratory,</p>
<p>we can suspend devices from the ceiling, for example.</p>
<p>Now we do have prototype wearable devices.</p>
<p>We did them in response to emails from Ebola workers</p>
<p>a number of years ago in Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>They said, we&rsquo;ve read about your work with athletes.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t you do something for us?</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re in the personal protective gear</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t be in the hot zone</p>
<p>for more than 15 or 20 minutes.</p>
<p>So that was started us on the challenge</p>
<p>of developing wearable systems that could go under the PPE.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve published that work now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m guessing the military special operators</p>
<p>that are out in the desert and other locations</p>
<p>are probably excited about this technology.</p>
<p>Well, once they get it.</p>
<p>Once they get it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think some people might wonder,</p>
<p>if there are all these studies</p>
<p>and there are these incredible results over the years,</p>
<p>why haven&rsquo;t we heard more about it?</p>
<p>And I will ask your opinion on that as well,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just editorialize a little bit.</p>
<p>Is that the best laboratory work</p>
<p>and its practical applications</p>
<p>oftentimes requires many studies.</p>
<p>And oftentimes there isn&rsquo;t a portal, so to speak,</p>
<p>to get that information out into the technology sector.</p>
<p>See, there is a company that&rsquo;s developing this technology</p>
<p>for people to use, to purchase and use.</p>
<p>You might as well just tell us now,</p>
<p>what is the name of that company?</p>
<p>And do they have a website?</p>
<p>People are going to want to know</p>
<p>where can they get this magical technology?</p>
<p>And is there a poor man&rsquo;s version of it as well?</p>
<p>Well, the company is Arteria, A-R-T-E-R-I-A.</p>
<p>And the website is <a class="link" href="https://www.coolmit.com"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >www.coolmit.com</a>.</p>
<p>So coolmit is just C-O-O-L-M-I-T-T, coolmit.com.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great website.</p>
<p>When I went there, it says that right now</p>
<p>the technology is only available</p>
<p>to professional sports teams and military.</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>Well, where we stand now is the new version</p>
<p>of the technology is sort of in beta test versions.</p>
<p>We got it into the hands of people</p>
<p>who had used the technology before.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s NFL teams that are using,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s college teams, there&rsquo;s Olympics,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the Navy SEALs, Major League Baseball,</p>
<p>the NBA, the National Tennis Association.</p>
<p>They have locations where now they are trying this out</p>
<p>and reporting back, how&rsquo;s it working?</p>
<p>How could you change it?</p>
<p>How could you improve it?</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>And so forth.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where we are.</p>
<p>But on the website, you can actually sign up</p>
<p>for being one who will be able to get one</p>
<p>when they are finally manufactured.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re now being made in fairly small lots</p>
<p>because you want to change things</p>
<p>as you realize how it can be improved.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is Stanford after all,</p>
<p>you want to get the technology right.</p>
<p>I like to joke that one of the reasons</p>
<p>I like being at Stanford so much</p>
<p>is that not only are my colleagues amazing</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re so forward thinking,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re all perfectionists.</p>
<p>And so the perfectionist mindset has to be perfect</p>
<p>before it can go live, so to speak.</p>
<p>Well, I think there will be a lot of interest.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the technology</p>
<p>in a little more detail for a moment.</p>
<p>And then let&rsquo;s talk about whether or not</p>
<p>cruder forms of that technology exist,</p>
<p>either for sake of safety and or performance.</p>
<p>So what is the cool mitt, as I understand,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s a mitt, it&rsquo;s a glove.</p>
<p>You put your hand into, you hold on to a surface</p>
<p>and that surface cools your hand</p>
<p>and thereby through this specialized portal</p>
<p>cools your core body temperature</p>
<p>and all the muscles of the body.</p>
<p>Subjectively, if I were to do this right now,</p>
<p>would I think that it was ice cold</p>
<p>or would I think it was just cool?</p>
<p>Just cool.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Ice cold is too cold.</p>
<p>So people always ask,</p>
<p>well, why can&rsquo;t you just stick your hand</p>
<p>in a bucket of ice water?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too cold.</p>
<p>What that does is that causes reflex vasoconstriction</p>
<p>of the very portals that you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to maximize the heat loss from.</p>
<p>So you stick your hand in cold water,</p>
<p>when it comes out, it&rsquo;s cold.</p>
<p>You just sealed up all the heat in your body.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>So what I sort of recommended to someone at one point,</p>
<p>they said, well, when I&rsquo;m running,</p>
<p>can I just carry a frozen juice can</p>
<p>and it will gradually melt?</p>
<p>And I said, well, no,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to decrease the heat loss</p>
<p>from that hand.</p>
<p>If every couple of minutes you switched hands,</p>
<p>it might work.</p>
<p>Well, I have a feeling that there are people now doing that</p>
<p>as well as trying this.</p>
<p>So how long in the cool mitt, at the proper temperature,</p>
<p>how long are people putting their hands into the mitt?</p>
<p>We, once again, had just standardized on three minutes.</p>
<p>And part of the reason for that is that the heat law,</p>
<p>the rate of heat loss is an exponentially declining curve.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>And three minutes sort of gets the best part of the curve.</p>
<p>So you can go longer and get more benefit,</p>
<p>but the biggest bang for the buck</p>
<p>is in the first two, three minutes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You mentioned a number of impressive organizations,</p>
<p>sports teams, and military that are using this.</p>
<p>This is not something that I typically see</p>
<p>on the sidelines of games,</p>
<p>although to be honest, I haven&rsquo;t looked very carefully.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that they are probably keeping the technology</p>
<p>somewhat under wraps.</p>
<p>Where and how are they doing this?</p>
<p>Are they running back to the locker room?</p>
<p>I mean, the military special operators</p>
<p>are doing their thing, but in terms of the athletes,</p>
<p>is it possible, hypothetically,</p>
<p>that athletes are doing this somewhat incognito?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible, but I really don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>People have mentioned here at Stanford,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t see the football team using it.</p>
<p>Well, the football team here at Stanford</p>
<p>is mostly playing in cold weather, cool weather.</p>
<p>Night games are cool.</p>
<p>Even day games are not very hot frequently here,</p>
<p>but when they go to a hot place like Arizona or Utah,</p>
<p>at least our coach, Shaw, says that they take it with them</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when they find the benefit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when they use it.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So is there a poor person&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>poor man or woman&rsquo;s version of this?</p>
<p>You mentioned the juice can passing back and forth.</p>
<p>You mentioned cooling the hands.</p>
<p>A number of people said to me after learning a little bit</p>
<p>about this science and technology</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve experienced some big effects,</p>
<p>positive effects of cooling by,</p>
<p>and I confess I&rsquo;ve done this,</p>
<p>taking a package of frozen blueberries</p>
<p>and just kind of passing it back and forth between my hands.</p>
<p>Now talking to you,</p>
<p>I realize I probably didn&rsquo;t do it long enough.</p>
<p>I probably was, I was only doing maybe 30 seconds,</p>
<p>passing it back and forth between my hands</p>
<p>and then going back into sets.</p>
<p>I did see a performance enhancing effect, absolutely,</p>
<p>but I realized I probably wasn&rsquo;t optimizing the protocol.</p>
<p>If you were going to give a crude protocol for,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say for the gym,</p>
<p>because with running it&rsquo;s a little bit tricky,</p>
<p>but what would that look like</p>
<p>if people wanted to just play with this</p>
<p>in some sort of fashion?</p>
<p>Well, you know, it would be experimental.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, none of that is kind of very controlled.</p>
<p>Your idea of frozen peas is a good idea.</p>
<p>And I think since there&rsquo;s been no actual study of that,</p>
<p>you would have to be, you working out</p>
<p>what is the best for you.</p>
<p>But one way to figure it out is that if,</p>
<p>after you hold the cold peas in one hand</p>
<p>and you switch it to the other hand,</p>
<p>if someone then comes in, feels your hand,</p>
<p>is it warm or cold?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s cold, it means you&rsquo;ve vasoconstricted.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s warm, it means the hot blood is still going there.</p>
<p>Okay, so we do that in the lab.</p>
<p>And the key is for it to not vasoconstrict.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s a test out there, folks.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to try this in kind of crude fashion,</p>
<p>at least until the cool mitt is available more broadly</p>
<p>to the general public,</p>
<p>you could assess, you want to assess</p>
<p>whether or not your palms actually feel cool</p>
<p>to the touch by somebody else.</p>
<p>And if it does, that means you&rsquo;ve essentially</p>
<p>shut down the port of your ceiling in more heat,</p>
<p>which is bad.</p>
<p>What about putting this cold pack</p>
<p>of some sort on the face or-</p>
<p>Or the feet.</p>
<p>More of the feet.</p>
<p>I work out at home.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t often work out barefooted,</p>
<p>but I suppose I could, like they did in the 70s,</p>
<p>you know, when those guys were walking around</p>
<p>without shoes and squatting without any shoes or socks on.</p>
<p>Could I put my feet on them?</p>
<p>You could.</p>
<p>If you had simply had a water-perfused pad</p>
<p>and you were circulating cool water through it,</p>
<p>you could just put your feet on it, okay?</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that you don&rsquo;t want,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you have just a cold pack of something.</p>
<p>The problem is, back to boundary layers again,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have a convective stream</p>
<p>of the cooling medium, the heat sink is not as effective</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;ll be a boundary layer developed</p>
<p>between the heat sink material and your skin.</p>
<p>So that decreases its efficacy.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Maybe we should just for a moment talk about convection,</p>
<p>radiation and convection, and just make that clear.</p>
<p>Like if I put my hands, let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s a cold night</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m at a campfire and I take my hands</p>
<p>and I put them out to the fire.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting radiation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting radiation.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>And then if it&rsquo;s a windy, warm night,</p>
<p>no, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s the best example.</p>
<p>Give us a good example of convection.</p>
<p>Convection, sure, is in a cool breeze.</p>
<p>The wind chill factor, that&rsquo;s due to convection, okay?</p>
<p>But in terms of heat transfer between two objects,</p>
<p>if you have convection of the medium,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s blood on the inside and water on the outside,</p>
<p>you increase the heat exchange</p>
<p>if you have convection on both sides.</p>
<p>Right, so this is why just planting my feet</p>
<p>on two packages of, my bare feet</p>
<p>on two packages of frozen peas,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s really no opportunity for circulation</p>
<p>and therefore heat transfer.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not really optimal, which is, and I-</p>
<p>But once again, it depends on the surface area</p>
<p>to get any benefit at all.</p>
<p>We have a study that we published,</p>
<p>which was investigating the standard treatment</p>
<p>for hyperthermia in the field.</p>
<p>And the standard treatment that&rsquo;s recommended</p>
<p>by medical organizations is you take cold packs</p>
<p>and you put them in the axilla, the groin.</p>
<p>The axilla or the armpits?</p>
<p>The armpits, yeah, the groin, which is-</p>
<p>Thin skin, lots of vasculature.</p>
<p>Right, and the neck.</p>
<p>So what we did is we did studies</p>
<p>in which we made people hyperthermic</p>
<p>and then we measured the rate at which we could cool them</p>
<p>by putting those positions in those heat exchange bags</p>
<p>in the recommended location versus on the glabrous skin</p>
<p>versus palms, soles, and face.</p>
<p>The cooling rate was double.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So we put the same ice packs, the same cold packs</p>
<p>on the heat portals rather than the axilla,</p>
<p>the groin and the face.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Or the neck.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So face, hands, and bottoms of feet</p>
<p>will cool you twice as fast</p>
<p>as putting cold packs into your armpits,</p>
<p>your groin, or back of neck.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>So I like to give the analogy</p>
<p>of if your car is overheating, okay,</p>
<p>and you have a hose, a garden hose,</p>
<p>where should you spray your cooling system?</p>
<p>Should you spray the radiator</p>
<p>or should you spray the tubes</p>
<p>going in and out of the radiator?</p>
<p>Well, the rationale with putting these cold packs</p>
<p>in the axilla, the groin, and the neck</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re getting close to the major arteries.</p>
<p>Sure, that&rsquo;s going to be effective,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s much more effective</p>
<p>if you actually increase the heat loss capacity</p>
<p>of the radiating surface, the radiators.</p>
<p>So you cool the hot stuff heading toward the core.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s essentially what the standard operating procedure is,</p>
<p>that you hit the arteries.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Arteries and veins.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to just tell a brief story</p>
<p>that illustrates how almost everybody gets this stuff wrong.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m going to use that as an opportunity</p>
<p>to ask you about heating, deliberate heating,</p>
<p>as opposed to deliberate cooling.</p>
<p>So about four months ago, a friend of mine,</p>
<p>incidentally, a guy who did nine years in the SEAL team</p>
<p>is really skilled cold water swimmer.</p>
<p>We went out for a swim in the morning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not nearly even close</p>
<p>to being in the same universe of his output potential.</p>
<p>We do these swims, I&rsquo;m familiar with them.</p>
<p>I got enough blubber on me</p>
<p>that I stay warm enough in the cold Pacific, no wetsuits.</p>
<p>We do the morning cold swim for about a mile or so.</p>
<p>And we brought with us a young kid that I know real well</p>
<p>that hangs out with us sometimes and trains with us</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s got very little body fat.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just exceptionally lean</p>
<p>despite eating everything inside, right?</p>
<p>Teenager, great athlete, great kid, great swimmer.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re out there swimming.</p>
<p>And at some point we&rsquo;re talking to him</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s clear that he&rsquo;s gone hypothermic.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s slurring his words, he&rsquo;s not doing well.</p>
<p>So we get him onto the beach, his teeth are turning yellow.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s quaking, he&rsquo;s not, he&rsquo;s got, you know,</p>
<p>his saliva is taking on that consistency</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s clear like he&rsquo;s hypothermic.</p>
<p>We go to the lifeguard station.</p>
<p>Lifeguard says, okay, let&rsquo;s get his vitals.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do all this.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, trying stand next to him, you know,</p>
<p>and heat him up by heating up his torso.</p>
<p>So there we are, like pressing against this guy,</p>
<p>our friend, trying to heat him up.</p>
<p>They get a blanket on him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m realizing he was barefoot.</p>
<p>His face was exposed,</p>
<p>although we did cover his head with the blanket.</p>
<p>And he eventually came back.</p>
<p>We got some warm liquids into him and he was okay.</p>
<p>He was fine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that his mother</p>
<p>is ever going to let him swim with us again.</p>
<p>If I ever disappear and go missing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because of that incident.</p>
<p>Anyway, he did great.</p>
<p>He recovered.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s back in the water and doing well.</p>
<p>But I realized that pretty much everything</p>
<p>from the point where we got back on the beach</p>
<p>until he was back to normal was we did incorrectly.</p>
<p>We heated his torso.</p>
<p>We left his extremities exposed.</p>
<p>And we assume we were doing the right thing.</p>
<p>And the lifeguard is a skilled lifeguard</p>
<p>at a major public beach.</p>
<p>So I guess the simple question is,</p>
<p>did we get everything wrong?</p>
<p>Did we get anything right?</p>
<p>And what would have been the better option</p>
<p>to heat up a hypothermic person</p>
<p>in that or a similar situation?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting you ask that</p>
<p>because that is the way we got</p>
<p>into this area of investigation.</p>
<p>I worked on how the hypothalamus</p>
<p>regulates body temperature, neurophysiology.</p>
<p>And one day we were having a discussion</p>
<p>with a colleague in the Department of Anesthesia.</p>
<p>And he jokingly said to my colleague,</p>
<p>he said, yeah, you guys think you know</p>
<p>so much about temperature.</p>
<p>I bet you couldn&rsquo;t solve a problem</p>
<p>we have in the recovery room.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Well, the patients come out of surgery,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re hypothermic and it takes us hours</p>
<p>to get them to stop shivering.</p>
<p>What do they do in the recovery room?</p>
<p>Exactly what you suggested.</p>
<p>They put in warm blankets, they put in heat lamps,</p>
<p>and it takes them an hour or two hours</p>
<p>to get these patients to stop shivering,</p>
<p>to bring them back up.</p>
<p>So we say, ah, it&rsquo;s a trivial problem.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a hard problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hard problem because when you&rsquo;re under anesthesia,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re vasodilated.</p>
<p>When you come out of anesthesia,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re hypothermic and you vasoconstrict.</p>
<p>That makes it very difficult to get heat into the body.</p>
<p>So we got the idea that, well,</p>
<p>if we could just take one appendage, like an arm,</p>
<p>and we put it in a environment wrapped in a heating pad</p>
<p>and a negative pressure, you know, suction,</p>
<p>that would pull more blood into that limb,</p>
<p>that blood would get heated</p>
<p>and it would warm the body up faster.</p>
<p>So my colleague built a prototype device.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t get such a device</p>
<p>into the hospital these days.</p>
<p>But we were with our anesthesiologist friend.</p>
<p>We took it into the recovery room,</p>
<p>and first thing the patient said,</p>
<p>no way, you&rsquo;re not gonna put that on my patient.</p>
<p>But he prevailed, and first patient didn&rsquo;t shiver at all.</p>
<p>First patient was back to normal temperature,</p>
<p>core temperature in, I think it was eight minutes,</p>
<p>eight or nine minutes.</p>
<p>Is this now standard practice in hospitals?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>So this is another example where I don&rsquo;t get upset about,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s upsetting to know that it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>but I think that it&rsquo;s yet another case</p>
<p>where a fundamental problem exists.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a science-based solution</p>
<p>that makes sense at the level of physiology,</p>
<p>engineering, and practice, and yet it&rsquo;s not being done.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I mean, that&rsquo;s a whole other discussion</p>
<p>as to what the limitations are.</p>
<p>Well, perhaps, I know a number of our listeners</p>
<p>are in the healthcare and medical profession</p>
<p>as well as military athletes,</p>
<p>and just also standard other types of jobs,</p>
<p>civilians doing other types of work.</p>
<p>It would be wonderful if people understood this.</p>
<p>So once again, is there a homegrown technology</p>
<p>that people could use?</p>
<p>If somebody is hypothermic,</p>
<p>what is going to be the best way for them to warm up?</p>
<p>Is it going to be holding a nice warm mug of cocoa</p>
<p>or something like that, but not too hot, I guess,</p>
<p>is again the idea?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, actually, you can go hotter on the glabrous skin.</p>
<p>Oh, because it&rsquo;ll dilate.</p>
<p>Because it takes the heat away faster, okay?</p>
<p>But back to the anesthesia,</p>
<p>what you can do is you can use warm pads.</p>
<p>They have them in all hospitals.</p>
<p>They have circulating water-perfused pads.</p>
<p>Hot water bottle type stuff. Put them on the feet.</p>
<p>So typically, they&rsquo;ll slide them under your lower back</p>
<p>or something like that?</p>
<p>Yeah, put them on the feet.</p>
<p>Okay, sure, that will do it.</p>
<p>But it turns out that we discovered through this work</p>
<p>that it had nothing to do with the whole arm.</p>
<p>It was only the hand,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when we came to the realization</p>
<p>of these special blood vessels.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t discover the blood vessels.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re described in Gray&rsquo;s Anatomy,</p>
<p>but nobody knew what they were for.</p>
<p>And you mentioned bears earlier and other hairy animals.</p>
<p>Do they have these AVAs as well?</p>
<p>Oh, and I suppose we haven&rsquo;t defined AVAs.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been pretty good about the no acronyms rule.</p>
<p>AVAs is?</p>
<p>Arteriovenous anastomosis,</p>
<p>so a connection between the arteries and the veins, yeah.</p>
<p>I actually use this technology.</p>
<p>I have a bulldog, Bulldog Mastiff.</p>
<p>He has a very high propensity for overheating</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re terrible at dumping heat,</p>
<p>and bulldogs are great at pushing themselves</p>
<p>to the point of exhaustion or death, it happens.</p>
<p>And so now we do what we call Palmer cooling.</p>
<p>Sorry, I couldn&rsquo;t help myself,</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ll take Costello and lower him</p>
<p>into a cool body of water, just the bottoms of his paws.</p>
<p>Although I think animals instinctually know to do this</p>
<p>and will go and stand in bodies of water.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t often lie down all the way, some do.</p>
<p>But they seem to know that&rsquo;s a great way</p>
<p>to cool themselves off.</p>
<p>Yeah, oh, absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p>And they get the advantage that their palms</p>
<p>and their feet are essentially the same thing.</p>
<p>We actually built devices for dogs.</p>
<p>Did you really?</p>
<p>And tried them on.</p>
<p>I did a rod and sled dogs, and it worked beautifully.</p>
<p>They had little backpacks with the equipment</p>
<p>and pads on all their feet, and it worked beautifully.</p>
<p>Amazing, amazing.</p>
<p>Along the lines of heating, deliberate heating,</p>
<p>wearing a knit cap is something that,</p>
<p>you see more of that on the East Coast.</p>
<p>People run around Boston and New England with a knit cap.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always done that at the start of my runs</p>
<p>to try and warm up more quickly, and then I take it off.</p>
<p>I shed layers as I go.</p>
<p>Is that a rational practice the way I just described it?</p>
<p>Yeah, because warming up is important too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain amount of quote-unquote warming up</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s required to lubricate joints,</p>
<p>or at least to get the sense that joints are lubricated</p>
<p>and to be able to move more easily.</p>
<p>Do you still recommend that people warm up?</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think we&rsquo;re misled by the term warm up</p>
<p>as if the major purpose is to raise temperature.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware of any data on this,</p>
<p>but I do think that the major contribution</p>
<p>is increasing flexibility.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to avoid having damage</p>
<p>of joints and tendons and ligaments and so forth.</p>
<p>But also, the ability of the mitochondria</p>
<p>to produce energy can be impaired at lower temperatures.</p>
<p>And you have to keep in mind</p>
<p>that we say our body temperature&rsquo;s 37 degrees,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Yeah, it varies across the day.</p>
<p>Well, it varies in parts of your body.</p>
<p>My hands and arms are not at 37 degrees right now.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re much lower.</p>
<p>So that raises an interesting question.</p>
<p>What is the best way to measure core body temperature?</p>
<p>Well, the best core temperature is that</p>
<p>what we use is esophageal.</p>
<p>So we put a thermocouple up the nose</p>
<p>about two feet down the esophagus</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s about the level of your heart.</p>
<p>Not gym or home practical, although I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Some of those COVID swab tests go pretty far.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even imagine it going any further.</p>
<p>I felt like my brain was getting tickled</p>
<p>and it was really unpleasant.</p>
<p>Tympanic is a pretty good-</p>
<p>So the ear.</p>
<p>The ear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not foolproof because you have to actually</p>
<p>have it aimed properly at the tympanum.</p>
<p>And frequently what you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re getting sort of a mixture of tympanic</p>
<p>plus ear canal temperature.</p>
<p>And for those listening and for those watching,</p>
<p>the tympanic is not going to be the pinna,</p>
<p>that this part of the ear, the outer part of the ear.</p>
<p>The tympanic is going to be near the tympanic.</p>
<p>Headed towards the tympanic membrane.</p>
<p>And yes, I&rsquo;m sticking my finger in my ear</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where the laser would actually have to go</p>
<p>to measure your temperature.</p>
<p>So when we&rsquo;re walking into restaurants</p>
<p>and other places nowadays</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re shining the laser at our forehead,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably giving a pretty crude readout of temperature.</p>
<p>It is, but there&rsquo;s much less insulation</p>
<p>between your brain and your forehead skin</p>
<p>than there is between your biceps and your arm skin.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to measure a surface temperature,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where you would do it.</p>
<p>And we do temperatures in the infrared.</p>
<p>We take infrared videos of athletes and our subjects.</p>
<p>And of course the face lights up.</p>
<p>Okay, so if we&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>I imagine there&rsquo;s going to be a technology coming soon</p>
<p>where you can point your smartwatch</p>
<p>or your smartphone at yourself</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to get a heat map.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s got to, if somebody out there</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t already invented this,</p>
<p>for the typical folks outside military,</p>
<p>somebody please invent that</p>
<p>because I think there&rsquo;s growing interest in temperature</p>
<p>based on the work that you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And also for sake of something I do want to touch on,</p>
<p>which is sleep and metabolism.</p>
<p>Although we don&rsquo;t want to open up those portals all the way</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;d need several days to cover it.</p>
<p>Okay, so putting on the cap,</p>
<p>what about some of the helmets and gloves</p>
<p>that are used in typical sports?</p>
<p>Do you think that those can be improved</p>
<p>in order to improve performance</p>
<p>in terms of their ventilation ability</p>
<p>or keeping palmer surfaces open, for instance?</p>
<p>Well, you mentioned about the knit cap</p>
<p>in cold weather especially,</p>
<p>and that is significant</p>
<p>because you do lose a lot of heat from your head,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a constant heat loss.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not variable like your glabrous skin.</p>
<p>So if you decrease that heat loss,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be warmer.</p>
<p>So sure, that has an impact.</p>
<p>Now, in terms of helmets, they should be ventilated.</p>
<p>I mean, they should have enough space in them</p>
<p>and holes in them so that air can circulate.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to insulate,</p>
<p>thermally insulate your scalp.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to decrease heat loss quite considerably.</p>
<p>You know, just for a resting individual,</p>
<p>the brain is about 20% of your metabolism.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a lot of heat production.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>I realized there was a question that I failed to ask earlier</p>
<p>that is burning in my mind now,</p>
<p>and I think is likely burning in the minds</p>
<p>of some of the listeners, which is,</p>
<p>so if you do this cooling in between sets in the gym,</p>
<p>you get this performance enhancing effect.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get the delayed onset muscle soreness,</p>
<p>which is great.</p>
<p>So presumably the body is adapting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting better as a consequence</p>
<p>of being able to do more work per unit time</p>
<p>or to go harder in some way, of course.</p>
<p>You get that adaptation.</p>
<p>Does that mean that you see a performance enhancing effect</p>
<p>even when you don&rsquo;t cool,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve previously done the cooling workouts?</p>
<p>So for instance, let&rsquo;s say I can do 10 sets of 10 dips,</p>
<p>which I like to think I can, maybe I need to go try.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve done that recently.</p>
<p>I do the cooling, I cool for three minutes between sets.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say I get to the point where I can do 20</p>
<p>for 10 sets, 10 sets of 20 repetitions,</p>
<p>and then I don&rsquo;t cool.</p>
<p>Will I be able to match or approximate</p>
<p>my new better performance?</p>
<p>You keep your gains.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a true conditioning effect.</p>
<p>You respond to the increased work volume</p>
<p>by all of those mechanisms you mentioned.</p>
<p>You increase the number of contractile elements</p>
<p>in your muscles.</p>
<p>Muscles get bigger.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>We had an experiment that involves</p>
<p>some of our female students, not athletes,</p>
<p>but just regular, they were freshmen actually.</p>
<p>And the experiment was 10 sets of pushups to muscle failure</p>
<p>with or without cooling.</p>
<p>Same regimen, three minutes of cooling</p>
<p>in between sets of pushups?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Some of those young ladies reached over 800 pushups.</p>
<p>Now, the total duration of the workout</p>
<p>could be getting much longer</p>
<p>as a consequence of doing more work.</p>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t take you longer.</p>
<p>Well, minor.</p>
<p>I mean, a pushup is pretty fast.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s pretty fast.</p>
<p>So you do 10 sets the maximum in 45 minutes total.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of pushups.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of pushups.</p>
<p>So the interesting thing is they came in one day</p>
<p>and they said, Dr. Hill, you cost us a lot of money.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, we had a formal dance this weekend.</p>
<p>We all had to buy new sleeveless dresses.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good problem to have.</p>
<p>Good problem to have.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about steroids, anabolic steroids.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re heading into an Olympics.</p>
<p>Every time the Olympics rolls around,</p>
<p>you hear about these cases of people getting popped,</p>
<p>as they call it, or caught for anabolic steroids.</p>
<p>There are some accusations out there now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be more.</p>
<p>This&rsquo;ll get handled in the press</p>
<p>and in the various organizations.</p>
<p>Clearly, athletes and non-athletes use anabolic steroids.</p>
<p>And typically, anabolic steroids</p>
<p>are of the testosterone variety.</p>
<p>There are derivatives, et cetera.</p>
<p>And those derivatives do different things</p>
<p>in anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera.</p>
<p>But typically, the idea is, at least as I understand it,</p>
<p>in talking to some of these individuals,</p>
<p>is that they allow people to train more</p>
<p>because they recover faster.</p>
<p>They are able to synthesize more protein</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re basically getting a second puberty.</p>
<p>Because as we all know, during puberty,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of growth of the body.</p>
<p>And of course, there are a lot of negative effects</p>
<p>of abuse of these things.</p>
<p>And they are banned from various sports organizations.</p>
<p>Especially, I should mention, in combat sports,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s especially concerning because in combat sports,</p>
<p>a performance enhancement means that you can harm somebody</p>
<p>more than you would be able to otherwise,</p>
<p>as opposed to in other sorts of sports.</p>
<p>Just to conceptualize it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not taking a moral stance on any of this.</p>
<p>I just want to ask you,</p>
<p>when you compare Palmer cooling to anabolic steroids</p>
<p>in terms of gym performance, what do you see?</p>
<p>Well, we do not do research on steroids.</p>
<p>But there is a lot of research in the literature.</p>
<p>A lot of that research in the strength conditioning</p>
<p>magazines is not very scientific.</p>
<p>No. Okay.</p>
<p>Or it might not even be scientific at all.</p>
<p>Right. Right.</p>
<p>But we did do an analysis of reputable papers.</p>
<p>And we did find, I think it was probably eight or nine,</p>
<p>10 studies on bench press.</p>
<p>Increase in bench press performance on steroids or not.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>These were males or females?</p>
<p>Well, these were all males.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll get back to the females.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that in all of these independent studies,</p>
<p>their rate of improvement was approximately 1% per week.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve just told you about studies</p>
<p>in which we&rsquo;ve had 300% increase in a month.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an enormous, enormous difference.</p>
<p>So why would you endanger your health</p>
<p>as well as your legal ability to compete</p>
<p>with such an ineffective tool?</p>
<p>Yeah. No, I think it&rsquo;s the notion</p>
<p>of performance enhancement is a really interesting one</p>
<p>because people clearly pay attention to nutrition,</p>
<p>sleep is now something that I think everybody,</p>
<p>but especially athletes are paying attention to.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I predict that temperature will be one</p>
<p>of the more powerful parameters</p>
<p>that people are going to be focusing on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because of the magnitude of the effects</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re describing.</p>
<p>And also because so much of the variability</p>
<p>around performance, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>has to do with when you go to a new environment.</p>
<p>Everyone has their home environment worked out pretty well,</p>
<p>sleep well in your own bed at home.</p>
<p>When you can control everything,</p>
<p>your performance is always great.</p>
<p>This is why I think military special operators</p>
<p>are particularly interesting group</p>
<p>because their whole world is centered</p>
<p>around elite and high performance</p>
<p>with very high risk, high consequence</p>
<p>under variable conditions.</p>
<p>The essence of their work is variable,</p>
<p>unpredictable conditions.</p>
<p>So you mentioned female athletes and steroids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious about this.</p>
<p>Yeah, because everybody has always said to us,</p>
<p>well, you only use male subjects</p>
<p>and obviously they have this testosterone background.</p>
<p>They have higher levels of testosterone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you get these results.</p>
<p>So we did a comparative study on females.</p>
<p>We get the same results.</p>
<p>Impressive.</p>
<p>And these are Stanford athletes or also-</p>
<p>No, these were not Stanford.</p>
<p>They were Stanford students, but not athletes.</p>
<p>Well, we have done, of course, work on some athletes,</p>
<p>but in general, we don&rsquo;t do research on our teams,</p>
<p>our varsity teams.</p>
<p>So they have their own protocols.</p>
<p>They have their own training programs.</p>
<p>Yeah, they don&rsquo;t like us to get too close to them.</p>
<p>No, I work with some of these folks and the coaches</p>
<p>and they are very skeptical with good reason.</p>
<p>Also, and the reason I ask is that when you see</p>
<p>these Pac-10 or Division I college athletes,</p>
<p>and then you see their peers,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s clearly a difference, right?</p>
<p>I mean, they are pedigreed throughout, right?</p>
<p>And more typical folks also have different goals.</p>
<p>They may not want to get infinitely stronger</p>
<p>or perform more endurance work.</p>
<p>So I want to ask you a couple of things</p>
<p>about shivering and metabolism,</p>
<p>because I think they&rsquo;re very interesting</p>
<p>and sufficiently related.</p>
<p>So my understanding is that shiver is an adaptation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s designed to heat us up.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That we have brown fat that&rsquo;s in compartments</p>
<p>around our body that are activated by shiver</p>
<p>or co-activated by shiver,</p>
<p>and that shivering is useful for increasing metabolism.</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>And does it require that cold be the stimulus?</p>
<p>So two scenarios, I&rsquo;ll give you an experiment.</p>
<p>I put someone into cold water of some sort,</p>
<p>and then I make them get out or I have them stand near it,</p>
<p>and then they start shivering.</p>
<p>My understanding is that their metabolism will increase.</p>
<p>What if I take someone and I just have them shiver,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not exposed by cold?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a deliberate shivering.</p>
<p>Will that also create a substantial increase in metabolism?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So deliberate shivering without cold</p>
<p>is essentially what happens when you get a fever.</p>
<p>Your set point goes up in your hypothalamus,</p>
<p>and you actually, even though your normal body temperature,</p>
<p>your thermostat is telling you you&rsquo;re too cold.</p>
<p>Increase your metabolism, so shiver, right?</p>
<p>So sure, shivering is a good way of increasing metabolism,</p>
<p>but it only can take metabolism up</p>
<p>maybe three or four times resting.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Whereas exercise can take you up 10 times.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>All right, I&rsquo;m going to ask a couple of more random questions</p>
<p>and seemingly random.</p>
<p>Do bears actually hibernate?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>The true hibernation?</p>
<p>Well, it depends on how you define true.</p>
<p>A bear, actually, we&rsquo;ve done a lot of work on bears.</p>
<p>Do you also put the nose thermocouple down in the esophagus?</p>
<p>We implant them surgically.</p>
<p>Okay, they&rsquo;re anesthetized when you implant them?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What kind of bears are these?</p>
<p>Black bears.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And did this with colleagues at University of Alaska,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re analyzing the data now.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;ve done is we&rsquo;ve had now a total of 18 bears,</p>
<p>and we implant them with EEG, EKG, temperature sensors.</p>
<p>And sometimes we actually measure their oxygen consumption.</p>
<p>These are bears in the wild.</p>
<p>These are bears in the wild,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re brought in to University of Alaska</p>
<p>where we keep them in an outdoor enclosure.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re hibernating in a nest box, in enclosure.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re recording this electrophysiological data</p>
<p>continuously for six months.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>How do I get on this protocol?</p>
<p>Craig and I are doing some work together going forward,</p>
<p>and maybe you can slide me onto this protocol too.</p>
<p>It sounds amazing.</p>
<p>Right now it&rsquo;s a matter of just analyzing the gigabytes,</p>
<p>terabytes of data that have been collected.</p>
<p>But anyway, you asked about hibernation.</p>
<p>So bears only go down to about 33, 34 degrees centigrade</p>
<p>in the core temperature.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been argued that, well, they can&rsquo;t go lower</p>
<p>because they have so much insulation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so big, their surface volume ratio and so forth.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>They shiver.</p>
<p>So if we have a day like a minus 40,</p>
<p>which you get up in Alaska,</p>
<p>they will go through periods of shivering</p>
<p>and maintain a core temperature on 33, 34.</p>
<p>Now the ground squirrels and the marmots,</p>
<p>which are smaller animals,</p>
<p>they will drop down to a body temperature,</p>
<p>maybe within a degree of the environment.</p>
<p>So they can go down to one or two degrees centigrade,</p>
<p>just above freezing.</p>
<p>During bouts of hibernation.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll stay in hibernation for seven or eight days</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll come back up to normal body temperature</p>
<p>for a day.</p>
<p>Then they&rsquo;ll go back down and do another job.</p>
<p>What do they eat during that day</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re warming up again?</p>
<p>Do they run around?</p>
<p>They rearrange their nests, eat.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;ve stored food, some species store lots of food.</p>
<p>Others just depend on their fat.</p>
<p>A former mentor of mine, my master&rsquo;s degree mentor</p>
<p>and a colleague and friend of yours,</p>
<p>Irving Zucker at UC Berkeley, told me a story once,</p>
<p>told me a lot of stories.</p>
<p>He tells great stories, as you know.</p>
<p>He told me that when an animal comes out of hibernation</p>
<p>periodically, that it&rsquo;s a very dramatic thing to observe.</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s not like they wake up and yawn and look around,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like a complete epileptic seizure.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on there? Shivering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a very dramatic shiver.</p>
<p>So at the low temperatures, they cannot shiver</p>
<p>because the effective temperature on the conduction</p>
<p>of the nerves and the muscle fibers.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re shut down, basically.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re shut down.</p>
<p>So there they use brown fat.</p>
<p>So activate brown fat.</p>
<p>And then when they get up to a temperature</p>
<p>of maybe 15, 16 degrees centigrade,</p>
<p>then the shivering starts and it gets very, very violent,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re still asleep.</p>
<p>Do we shiver in our sleep?</p>
<p>I would imagine we do, but it probably wakes us up.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So the brown fat is kind of like kindling.</p>
<p>The brown fat is a tissue which has lots of stored energy</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s fat.</p>
<p>But unlike our white fat, our regular fat,</p>
<p>it also has lots of these little powerhouses, mitochondria,</p>
<p>and lots of blood supply.</p>
<p>So essentially it is a tissue just to produce heat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s there for.</p>
<p>Now in these hibernators, there are big patches</p>
<p>of brown fat at certain locations that are critical,</p>
<p>like around the heart, for example.</p>
<p>For us, the brown fat is sort of distributed.</p>
<p>So for many, many years,</p>
<p>it was thought humans don&rsquo;t have brown fat,</p>
<p>but indeed we do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not localized into discrete fat pads</p>
<p>like it is in ground squirrels, marmots.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why the phrase fat pads is so satisfying to say</p>
<p>but it is fat pads.</p>
<p>Speaking of fat pads, I was taught that we have,</p>
<p>by the internet, I should say,</p>
<p>I was taught by the internet that we have brown fat</p>
<p>between our scapulae and our upper neck.</p>
<p>Is that truly a source of brown enrichment for brown fat?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a ground squirrel.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s complete, this is all the drawings out there.</p>
<p>Okay, so what I&rsquo;m hearing you say</p>
<p>is that brown fat is actually distributed in patches.</p>
<p>In humans, it&rsquo;s distributed along with other fat tissue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as discrete.</p>
<p>The reason I&rsquo;m kind of shocked and amused</p>
<p>and troubled by this is because</p>
<p>there is a somewhat standard protocol</p>
<p>in the performance wellness, whatever world,</p>
<p>whatever you want to call it,</p>
<p>of putting ice packs on the upper back</p>
<p>as a way to stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hearing some inhales of concern from the physiologist.</p>
<p>So tell me why, it sounds like that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>not the best way to stimulate brown fat activation.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s put it this way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not attacking anyone specifically</p>
<p>because the whole world believes this, so it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But it may not be totally facetious or false.</p>
<p>Think of what that&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>If you put ice right there where your spinal cord</p>
<p>is close to the surface,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re going to hit the vertebral arteries.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re essentially putting a cold source</p>
<p>into the brain to the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>The hypothalamus says you&rsquo;re too cold,</p>
<p>so it is going to turn on shivering and brown fat.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Would there be a better site</p>
<p>for sake of activating brown fat, palmer cooling?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say because the activation of brown fat</p>
<p>is a sympathetic nervous system response.</p>
<p>So any lowering of core temperature</p>
<p>that will let the thermostat say you&rsquo;re too cold</p>
<p>is going to turn on sympathetic.</p>
<p>Now, people will have perhaps</p>
<p>different amounts of brown fat.</p>
<p>So newborn have more brown fat than adults.</p>
<p>Because the newborns can&rsquo;t shiver, correct?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s what I read.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I read that in what I believe to be credible sources.</p>
<p>Yeah, it could be.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It depends on if it&rsquo;s really newborn, I can agree,</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have all of the motor pathways</p>
<p>connected up yet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that occurs in early days of life</p>
<p>and is probably one of the functions of REM sleep,</p>
<p>which infants have a lot of.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But how to activate brown fat</p>
<p>if you are consistently exposed to cold.</p>
<p>So if you live in the Arctic</p>
<p>and you go out jogging in the winter,</p>
<p>maybe that will increase the amount of brown fat you have.</p>
<p>If you live in the tropics, maybe you have less brown fat.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know of any studies which have looked into that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Ice headache.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;ll drink a cold beverage</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ll eat ice cream and my head will-</p>
<p>Brain freeze.</p>
<p>Brain freeze.</p>
<p>And speaking of special forces,</p>
<p>I was talking to, you know, we all see the images,</p>
<p>the SEAL training slash screening in Coronado</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re going in and out of the Pacific,</p>
<p>which is very cold.</p>
<p>But I know they also spend some time</p>
<p>in the very cold waters of Kodiak, Alaska.</p>
<p>You mentioned Alaska.</p>
<p>Brain freeze, so-called ice headache,</p>
<p>is a common occurrence there in those situations.</p>
<p>But we all have experienced this.</p>
<p>We eat ice cream, we get that brain freeze.</p>
<p>I can feel it right now a little bit subjectively.</p>
<p>I can induce it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on there?</p>
<p>And I would always just rub my tongue</p>
<p>on the roof of my mouth.</p>
<p>Is there something that I&rsquo;m doing that&rsquo;s functional there</p>
<p>just to try and alleviate it?</p>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p>The thing is that the roof of your mouth</p>
<p>is very close to your hypothalamus.</p>
<p>So if indeed it&rsquo;s a popsicle</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s giving you the brain freeze,</p>
<p>it may be a direct cooling effect</p>
<p>from the roof of your mouth.</p>
<p>You put your tongue there,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re insulating the roof of your mouth.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the source of the brain freeze?</p>
<p>Is it a vasoconstriction?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a vasomotor change.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s constriction,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s more likely a vaso,</p>
<p>an increase in blood pressure,</p>
<p>which will essentially cause an expansion of the arteries</p>
<p>and activate pain receptors.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have pain receptors in the neural tissue,</p>
<p>in the brain.</p>
<p>We have them in the meninges</p>
<p>and predominantly associated with the blood vessels,</p>
<p>the walls of the blood vessels.</p>
<p>So if you have something</p>
<p>which will dramatically increase your blood pressure</p>
<p>going to the brain,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re likely to get a&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had some preliminary data.</p>
<p>I even hate to mention this</p>
<p>because we have not been able to pursue it systematically,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve had some experience with people with migraine</p>
<p>that say if they use one of our devices to heat,</p>
<p>that the migraine goes away.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The idea-</p>
<p>A lot of people suffer from migraine.</p>
<p>I know there are a lot of different types of migraine.</p>
<p>Been reading a lot about this lately</p>
<p>because I get so many questions about migraine.</p>
<p>But I think-</p>
<p>I hate to say anything.</p>
<p>Sure, and we&rsquo;ll just underscore this as preliminary.</p>
<p>And people have been great about understanding</p>
<p>that when we say preliminary,</p>
<p>we mean it has not passed through the required filters</p>
<p>to call it hard fact yet.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even have a decent data set.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just these are anecdotal reports.</p>
<p>Anecdata, as people like to call it.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t even like to call it that</p>
<p>because then we don&rsquo;t want to give it more weight</p>
<p>than it deserves.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>The ice headache</p>
<p>and the increase in blood pressure is interesting</p>
<p>because the only thing that I&rsquo;ve heard is similar to it</p>
<p>is something that comes from&hellip;</p>
<p>You know, they have these competitions</p>
<p>where people eat these very hot chili peppers.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s kind of a-</p>
<p>An ego thing, I guess, for reasons that escape me,</p>
<p>that eating really hot peppers.</p>
<p>And every once in a while,</p>
<p>someone will eat one of these</p>
<p>and get what&rsquo;s called thunderclap headache,</p>
<p>where a headache comes on extremely quickly.</p>
<p>And so quickly that it&rsquo;s caused&hellip;</p>
<p>So severe, rather,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s been known to cause stroke and brain damage.</p>
<p>So these very, very, very hot peppers,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not acclimated to them,</p>
<p>and maybe even if you are,</p>
<p>have been shown to actually cause brain damage.</p>
<p>Yeah, some good evidence for this.</p>
<p>I do want to talk about something</p>
<p>that we have not touched on yet,</p>
<p>which is NEAT, non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right?</p>
<p>So non-activity associated thermogenesis</p>
<p>and the fidgeters, right?</p>
<p>So the classic work of like Rothwell and Stock</p>
<p>and the idea that some people who overeat</p>
<p>are burning off that energy by way of shaking their knee</p>
<p>or moving around a lot.</p>
<p>These are the kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>They quote, quote, unquote, nervous types,</p>
<p>but they quoted in those studies</p>
<p>a huge degree of caloric burn,</p>
<p>800, 2,500 calories per day burned</p>
<p>above those who sit rather still.</p>
<p>Does that seem far-fetched?</p>
<p>Those are older data,</p>
<p>but any comment on NEAT</p>
<p>or non-exercise induced thermogenesis?</p>
<p>Well, I do think it&rsquo;s pretty straightforward</p>
<p>that if you increase muscle activity of any kind,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re increasing your energy consumption</p>
<p>and your heat production.</p>
<p>And no, the really extreme example</p>
<p>is hyper and hypothyroidism.</p>
<p>People that are hyperthyroid are fidgety</p>
<p>and they have a high metabolic rate and they&rsquo;re hot.</p>
<p>And people that are hypothermic are cool.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t move very much.</p>
<p>So any kind of muscle activity increases.</p>
<p>When you say it&rsquo;s not much activity,</p>
<p>but remember, it&rsquo;s only 20% effective.</p>
<p>80% of the energy is going to heat.</p>
<p>So it may not exert much energy to tap your foot,</p>
<p>but four times the amount of energy</p>
<p>that is going into the movement is being lost as heat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>A couple more quick questions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of excitement these days</p>
<p>or at least usage these days of so-called energy drinks</p>
<p>or pre-workout drinks.</p>
<p>Many of these contain thermogenic compounds.</p>
<p>So caffeine, there&rsquo;s a culture now of taking arginine,</p>
<p>things that support arginine.</p>
<p>So beet juice and L-citrulline,</p>
<p>things to dilate the blood vessels.</p>
<p>Sometimes this is for sake of increasing blood flow</p>
<p>to the muscles during resistance exercise,</p>
<p>but a lot of these are thermogenic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to increase body temperature.</p>
<p>And is it possible that some of these energy drinks</p>
<p>are actually, or similar, you know,</p>
<p>six espresso or whatever it is,</p>
<p>are acting to prevent optimal performance</p>
<p>or reduce performance?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that the temperature rise</p>
<p>is that, I really don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But what it does is it makes you more jittery</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to increase that neat</p>
<p>that you were talking about.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s another thing.</p>
<p>And that is that when you&rsquo;re exercising your muscle</p>
<p>and it becomes slightly hypoxic,</p>
<p>I mean, the oxygen supply is not enough,</p>
<p>the muscle releases adenosine.</p>
<p>And what adenosine does in the muscle</p>
<p>is cause the blood vessels to open up, to dilate.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a way of increasing the blood flow to the muscle</p>
<p>and therefore the oxygen supply to the muscle.</p>
<p>And caffeine is essentially an adenosine antagonist.</p>
<p>An adenosine antagonist, right.</p>
<p>So if under the strict logic,</p>
<p>ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release</p>
<p>and will reduce oxygen utilization of the muscle.</p>
<p>So that would lead me to believe</p>
<p>that motivational support aside,</p>
<p>that caffeine will hinder muscular performance.</p>
<p>I would think so,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t give you an authoritative answer on that.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;re just going through the logic</p>
<p>and the gymnastics around that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a fascinating area that deserves attention</p>
<p>because the question of what one can ingest</p>
<p>in order to perform better,</p>
<p>to say nothing of hormone augmentation,</p>
<p>but has often leads back to stimulants.</p>
<p>And if those stimulants,</p>
<p>most of which include caffeine of some sort,</p>
<p>are inhibiting the adenosine system</p>
<p>and the adenosine system is supporting</p>
<p>the oxygenation of muscle,</p>
<p>then I would imagine that avoiding them</p>
<p>might be the better option.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just am not aware of data that would&hellip;</p>
<p>So this is a general phenomenon of adenosine</p>
<p>and blood flow.</p>
<p>It has, of course, a different effect in the brain.</p>
<p>Adenosine causes sleep.</p>
<p>Caffeine keeps you awake.</p>
<p>And if you stay awake,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have a higher metabolic rate</p>
<p>than if you go to sleep.</p>
<p>So, and the thing is, you say, energy drinks.</p>
<p>The question is, what really is in them?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually a cocktail of things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t take these.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like them at all,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re usually a combination of vasodilators,</p>
<p>caffeine, some sort of stimulant.</p>
<p>And a source of glucose, usually.</p>
<p>Sometimes a source of glucose and sometimes not.</p>
<p>And oftentimes there are vasodilators</p>
<p>and there are compounds that are thought to be</p>
<p>so-called nootropics, smart drugs,</p>
<p>that basically increase acetylcholine</p>
<p>or norepinephrine transmission.</p>
<p>You know, in the 80s and 90s,</p>
<p>the beta-3 agonists like clembuterol were very popular,</p>
<p>but they were all banned.</p>
<p>So those are all banned from&hellip;</p>
<p>Although people use them recreationally,</p>
<p>which I do not recommend.</p>
<p>There were actually a number of deaths</p>
<p>due to dehydration, overheating, as well as cardiac effects.</p>
<p>Before we wrap up,</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;ve done a ton of work on sleep.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re going to have to do another episode</p>
<p>about your work on sleep,</p>
<p>because the amount of data that you&rsquo;ve produced there</p>
<p>is vast, actually.</p>
<p>So I first got to know you and your work</p>
<p>related to sleep and temperature.</p>
<p>We all hear nowadays that it&rsquo;s good to keep the room</p>
<p>that you sleep in cool, keep it dark.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked a number of times on podcast episodes</p>
<p>about the role of light and shifting and circadian rhythms.</p>
<p>I have two questions related to sleep.</p>
<p>One is, are there any things</p>
<p>that may or may not relate to temperature,</p>
<p>but that you think are very useful</p>
<p>for getting better sleep</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t hear that much about,</p>
<p>that people might want to consider or try,</p>
<p>realizing that there are a lot of reasons</p>
<p>why people don&rsquo;t sleep great.</p>
<p>But what are some things</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t hear that much about these days</p>
<p>that you wish people knew?</p>
<p>Well, the sleep medicine community</p>
<p>now puts a lot more emphasis on cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p>than on pharmacology.</p>
<p>So what cognitive behavioral therapy does</p>
<p>is it essentially increases your sleep hygiene.</p>
<p>So there are certain just general rules.</p>
<p>So have a regular bedtime and a regular arousal time.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be skipping back and forth all the time.</p>
<p>Arousal, you mean wake up time?</p>
<p>Wake up time, yeah.</p>
<p>Spoken like a true physiologist.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Another thing is don&rsquo;t use screens</p>
<p>within a couple hours of bedtime</p>
<p>because screens are predominantly rich</p>
<p>in blue light.</p>
<p>And what that does is you mentioned the circadian system.</p>
<p>That affects your circadian system.</p>
<p>That pushes off your circadian stimulus for sleep, okay?</p>
<p>Another thing is, of course, relax.</p>
<p>I mean, don&rsquo;t work right up</p>
<p>till the time you&rsquo;re going to bed.</p>
<p>Take some time to do something relaxing.</p>
<p>And then temperature, you&rsquo;ve mentioned that.</p>
<p>And for many people, a warm bath, you know,</p>
<p>is really conducive to good sleep.</p>
<p>And people are now swearing</p>
<p>by a cooler environment for sleep.</p>
<p>And that makes sense in terms of the circadian effect</p>
<p>on body temperature.</p>
<p>So our circadian clock is affecting our thermostat.</p>
<p>So at the time we go to bed,</p>
<p>our thermostat is on its way down to a lower set point.</p>
<p>So what happens?</p>
<p>You go to bed and you&rsquo;re feeling a little bit cool.</p>
<p>So you pile on lots of blankets.</p>
<p>And then what happens is you wake up a little bit later</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re hot, so you throw them off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because your thermostat has set downward.</p>
<p>Now, why is it better to have a cool environment?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better to have a cool environment</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s easier to thermoregulate.</p>
<p>So you go to Europe in the summertime</p>
<p>and the hotel rooms still have these big comforters,</p>
<p>these down comforters.</p>
<p>So how do you deal with that?</p>
<p>You stick out your hands and your legs, okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always slept with,</p>
<p>I have one leg that just kind of hangs out of the, yeah.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re your heat loss surfaces, right?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in a cool environment,</p>
<p>you can take advantage of that.</p>
<p>You can take advantage by passively</p>
<p>regulating your body temperature.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to get up and wake up and say,</p>
<p>oh my God, I got to change the covers</p>
<p>or blankets or what have you.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a warm environment, what can you do?</p>
<p>You need to sleep with one hand in the cool mitt, right?</p>
<p>And right now that&rsquo;s not available yet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not available.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard about it that way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always heard you want to sleep in a cool room</p>
<p>or keep the room cold.</p>
<p>But I never realized why that&rsquo;s useful,</p>
<p>which is as you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>that then you can move these glabrous surfaces in and out.</p>
<p>You could even,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll sometimes even wake up under the blanket completely.</p>
<p>Very, very interesting.</p>
<p>That finally a rational science grounded explanation</p>
<p>for why we need to sleep in a cool room.</p>
<p>Because I always thought,</p>
<p>well, if your temperature is going down anyway,</p>
<p>why do you have to sleep in a cool room?</p>
<p>What about wearing socks while you sleep?</p>
<p>That was big a few years ago where they said,</p>
<p>you know, you should put socks on.</p>
<p>Now I would think that&rsquo;s probably the wrong advice.</p>
<p>You probably just-</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s wrong advice.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an old, old study that was supported by,</p>
<p>I think, Eddie Bauer, the sleeping bag company.</p>
<p>And what the study showed,</p>
<p>what the study was asking is,</p>
<p>what are the most temperature sensitive spots in the body?</p>
<p>Where do you feel cold?</p>
<p>And what that showed was it was the toes.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>So when you sample water with your toe,</p>
<p>you always see that.</p>
<p>So the socks essentially are promoting thermal comfort</p>
<p>by insulating that area that&rsquo;s quite sensitive.</p>
<p>Now, of course, if it&rsquo;s too warm,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to put socks on.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well, Craig, thank you so much.</p>
<p>You gave so much information</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actionable and interesting.</p>
