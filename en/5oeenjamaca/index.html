<p>something James</p>
<p>but it was working</p>
<p>okay I can hear you now oh good I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know but uh</p>
<p>go ahead with your question Dr Burr can</p>
<p>hear you I&rsquo;m very happy to be here Dr</p>
<p>Burke</p>
<p>I hope you can hear me now he can go</p>
<p>ahead with your question James okay</p>
<p>please Dr Burke mine would not be really</p>
<p>a question I&rsquo;m just want to say thank</p>
<p>you very much</p>
<p>I was very very sick my wife and I we</p>
<p>were very sick</p>
<p>we were having insulin resistance we I</p>
<p>myself was a blown up diabetic I was a</p>
<p>diabetic</p>
<p>and it was the Christmas of</p>
<p>last year that we happened to be in</p>
<p>Nairobi Kenya</p>
<p>and that was my first time to come</p>
<p>across your videos</p>
<p>I you know these days Dr anything on the</p>
<p>video people don&rsquo;t take it serious</p>
<p>because many things videos YouTube the</p>
<p>social media has been corrupted with so</p>
<p>many things in the first place I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>believe that it was real</p>
<p>but I decided to take few minutes to</p>
<p>listen to you</p>
<p>I listened that uh video to the end</p>
<p>I said is this really real or just uh</p>
<p>things of the social media</p>
<p>and then I continued I subscribed and</p>
<p>then I started receiving your videos</p>
<p>then I continued watching you for almost</p>
<p>a week</p>
<p>right from there we decided to put it on</p>
<p>trail</p>
<p>first of all we started that let us try</p>
<p>two meals a day</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>um 16 hours 8 hours of window eating</p>
<p>window and 16 hours of fasting</p>
<p>when we tried it doctor it it it was</p>
<p>showing some improvements</p>
<p>that I could wake up in the morning</p>
<p>without having dizziness heavy pains and</p>
<p>so on and so on</p>
<p>so for two weeks I said no let us go for</p>
<p>a meal how much</p>
<p>one meal a day</p>
<p>that was in our January 2022 yeah</p>
<p>13 of January</p>
<p>we followed it very very strictly we</p>
<p>went on three months later</p>
<p>we went for checkup</p>
<p>the results were very amazing the doctor</p>
<p>asked what have you done what have you</p>
<p>done</p>
<p>I said what have I done I&rsquo;ve just</p>
<p>followed the instructions from one of</p>
<p>the doctors in U.S</p>
<p>and this seemed to be helpful</p>
<p>for the first time my A1C dropped</p>
<p>to 5.3</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s fantastic that was wonderful</p>
<p>and then my fasting blood sugar that</p>
<p>morning was almost like</p>
<p>um 90. by the way James I&rsquo;m sorry we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just a little short on time but man</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re really excited to hear the grand</p>
<p>progress that you&rsquo;ve made uh why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you you know this would be one of those</p>
<p>great things for a testimonial if you</p>
<p>could uh write into drberg.com Dr Burke</p>
<p>can you give us a little more guidance</p>
<p>on how he can do a testimonial</p>
<p>hey James thank you so much for that</p>
<p>success story it&rsquo;s just yeah and I</p>
<p>really want to hear the whole thing the</p>
<p>only thing is I have a whole uh series</p>
<p>of people in in line waiting so um we</p>
<p>have to do it quick but definitely send</p>
<p>me the whole write-up this is amazing</p>
<p>this is amazing went to your doctor your</p>
<p>A1C came down your blood sugars came</p>
<p>down doing one omad you probably did</p>
<p>keto as well</p>
<p>um this is this is awesome awesome I I</p>
<p>just I&rsquo;m blown away that</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s just not so more obvious</p>
<p>to the average doc that you know whoa</p>
<p>got high sugar so maybe we should change</p>
<p>the diet and lower the sugar so</p>
<p>unfortunately</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um you know what&rsquo;s missing in the Health</p>
<p>Care system is the creation of Health it</p>
<p>is kind of more the management of</p>
<p>symptoms</p>
<p>um other but there&rsquo;s not a lot of things</p>
<p>to create health and one thing is to</p>
<p>lower the sugars increase the nutrient</p>
<p>dense foods</p>
<p>um I mean if you take a look at</p>
<p>a place where they need nutrient dense</p>
<p>foods the most</p>
<p>that would be in the hospital right but</p>
<p>what do they serve people in the</p>
<p>hospital</p>
<p>institutional foods that the same foods</p>
<p>that they serve prisoners I mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just so bad it&rsquo;s like worse than</p>
<p>the standard American diet so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know when I had my shoulder work</p>
<p>done</p>
<p>I was like oh wow what am I going to eat</p>
<p>so they had well they had some Jello and</p>
<p>crackers and some um</p>
<p>some beef that looked like it was like</p>
<p>completely processed I mean it was just</p>
<p>so bad so anyway Steve Let&rsquo;s uh let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>on to uh the next topic okay okay the</p>
<p>next topic is we have six not five but</p>
<p>six exciting quiz questions and here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the first one</p>
<p>all right uh let&rsquo;s see here so what is</p>
<p>the most important anti-stress hormone</p>
<p>in the body</p>
<p>okay so you have all this cortisol all</p>
<p>this stress</p>
<p>did you realize that there&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>hormone that counters all this what</p>
<p>would that be</p>
<p>um this might be new information but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very exciting because</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s something brand new I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really discussed in any of my YouTube</p>
<p>channel uh videos</p>
<p>very good okay let&rsquo;s go over to social</p>
<p>media Victoria from Facebook please</p>
<p>share any advice you have on clearing up</p>
<p>stretch marks</p>
<p>I did a video on this</p>
<p>um I think the best thing you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dealing with um</p>
<p>the elastin in the skin is like um a</p>
<p>rubber band right and so now the um</p>
<p>elastin is overstretched or the the</p>
<p>collagen fibers have overstretched now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they leave these little marks</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re gonna have to clean up that</p>
<p>through um various things um increasing</p>
<p>circulation to the area you can rub</p>
<p>these superficial part of the skin with</p>
<p>a kind of a they have a brushes that you</p>
<p>can when you&rsquo;re in the shower you can do</p>
<p>that as well as I would think the</p>
<p>biggest thing would be prolonged fasting</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re going through autophagy and</p>
<p>your body&rsquo;s recycling these old damaged</p>
<p>proteins and then the third thing</p>
<p>is I would rub Vitamin E oil into your</p>
<p>skin and that will help break up some of</p>
<p>the scar tissue the same thing if you</p>
<p>have pock marks from acne vitamin E is a</p>
<p>really good um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>kind of an anti-fibrotic kind of a</p>
<p>breaking up Scar Tissue vitamin</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s uh that&rsquo;s interesting okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see I also want to go to Michelle</p>
<p>in Germany because she keeps popping off</p>
<p>and on not to insult your internet there</p>
<p>in Germany but for some reason it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>behaving so stand by unmute yourself</p>
<p>dear and uh you are on with Dr bird</p>
<p>am I unmuted you are go ahead with your</p>
<p>question Michelle</p>
<p>all right so I&rsquo;m having trouble</p>
<p>maintaining ketosis I&rsquo;m hearing a lot of</p>
<p>background stuff I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>um so I&rsquo;m having trouble maintaining</p>
<p>ketosis and I have a history of</p>
<p>prolactinoma I had surgery in 2018</p>
<p>and a number of</p>
<p>medical problems</p>
<p>um so I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s going on I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing intermittent fasting I thought I</p>
<p>was keeping my carbohydrates pretty low</p>
<p>but my fasting glucose levels are higher</p>
<p>than my right after eating so I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>little confused</p>
<p>so are you on a a really low</p>
<p>carbohydrate diet</p>
<p>probably not as low as as zero but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty low okay</p>
<p>mostly salmon vegetables and salad</p>
<p>so I think the um a really good product</p>
<p>because you had you had surgery on this</p>
<p>this tumor right yeah so um I think if</p>
<p>you took a stand it&rsquo;s called a standard</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a standard processed product called</p>
<p>pituitrophin</p>
<p>called the two at 12 and PMG I would</p>
<p>take one before bed because a lot of</p>
<p>times when you have surgery</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that that can affect other hormones and</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a there could be an</p>
<p>issue with that I&rsquo;ve seen that before</p>
<p>and just trying to regulate this hormone</p>
<p>flow</p>
<p>um and then the other thing that I think</p>
<p>would help you</p>
<p>um well just just to realize that some</p>
<p>of that blood sugar issue that might be</p>
<p>too high is probably being made by your</p>
<p>own liver it&rsquo;s not you&rsquo;re not eating</p>
<p>sugar so your liver is just making it so</p>
<p>um you might have to just do something</p>
<p>to burn that extra sugar off to get you</p>
<p>into deeper ketosis and with time that</p>
<p>will improve if you just maintain that</p>
<p>all over time but you might want to</p>
<p>exercise burning extra sugar off every</p>
<p>day and then um that will um the kind of</p>
<p>counter what you&rsquo;re dealing with and do</p>
<p>other things to stabilize your blood</p>
<p>sugars too like um the cinnamon you know</p>
<p>you can put some cinnamon on your toast</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being very sarcastic now just uh</p>
<p>cinnamon apple cider vinegar is another</p>
<p>good one and berberine because you</p>
<p>probably have some insulin resistance</p>
<p>that you just have to break through and</p>
<p>it takes some time okay</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s terrific well thank you so</p>
<p>much Michelle and I&rsquo;m glad we were able</p>
<p>to get you on the air and let&rsquo;s see I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>looking for answers Terry I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>let me look through this list I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think I see it yet in the meantime we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got Michelle from Germany and we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>a pause from Denmark we&rsquo;ll have her up</p>

<p>everybody for participating in class and</p>
<p>in fact all our guests again are from</p>
<p>out of town somewhere so thanks so much</p>
<p>for participating and making the show</p>
<p>such a success everyone and let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>what let&rsquo;s go back to face back to</p>
<p>social media with Facebook</p>
<p>Linda from Facebook I have heart failure</p>
<p>what advice would you share to help me I</p>
<p>guess congenital heart failure is that</p>
<p>what that is Maybe</p>
<p>well the best thing the best thing to</p>
<p>take from a nutrient angle other than go</p>
<p>on the healthy version of Keto and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting immediately is to</p>
<p>start uh find some um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called tocotrino it&rsquo;s a vitamin E</p>
<p>tocotrino that is very very good for the</p>
<p>heart heart protective there&rsquo;s many</p>
<p>things in our heart protective cardio</p>
<p>protective that you can take with</p>
<p>natural nutritional things so that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>simple version and of course you know</p>
<p>the things that the two things that</p>
<p>really destroy the heart are refined</p>
<p>grains</p>
<p>and refined sugars so um</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s kind of what I would do</p>
<p>immediately and I think um you might be</p>
<p>able to pull yourself out I have a lot</p>
<p>of videos on the cardiovascular system</p>
<p>uh watch them all and apply the</p>
<p>information</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>Steve I I had a comment that someone was</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>you know asking well they kind of had a</p>
<p>disagreement they&rsquo;re like why why do you</p>
<p>you know I like your information but why</p>
<p>do you sell nutritional products you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s kind of a conflict of interest</p>
<p>and I I said well would you rather have</p>
<p>someone who doesn&rsquo;t know about nutrition</p>
<p>Market or sell</p>
<p>products Health Products right I mean</p>
<p>for example I&rsquo;ll give you an example</p>
<p>um I recently got this email from</p>
<p>my Manufacturing Company who helps me</p>
<p>with the um making the vitamins</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>out of</p>
<p>3500 other clients that they&rsquo;ve worked</p>
<p>with over the years no one has ever</p>
<p>asked or requested</p>
<p>a product without maltodextrin</p>
<p>except me because I I don&rsquo;t want that in</p>
<p>any of my products and he said he said</p>
<p>99.9 of all these products that involve</p>
<p>like spraying powders and also um</p>
<p>like flavorings have hidden maltodextrin</p>
<p>right so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>this is another reason why you you know</p>
<p>if someone&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>promoting products you got to make sure</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have these hidden things</p>
<p>in there and so um I would recommend</p>
<p>reaching out to the company that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>selling you a product and then making</p>
<p>sure that they send you a documentation</p>
<p>that ours are not with maltodextrin or</p>
<p>hidden things like that because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just so invasive it&rsquo;s just all over the</p>
<p>place and this maltodextrin is way worse</p>
<p>than sugar and glucose on the glycemic</p>
<p>index it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>way higher than a hundred and glucose is</p>
<ol start="100">
<li>so</li>
</ol>
<p>here we are trying to get in keto we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to lower our carbs and then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking nutrition you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>that might be helping you but it could</p>
<p>be filled with sugar unknowingly so I</p>
<p>just wanted to put that out there and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one thing that you have to watch</p>
<p>for well I&rsquo;ll tell you what there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>fly on the wall you know I work in and</p>
<p>around Dr Berg and his lovely wife Karen</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m at Liberty to</p>
<p>say this but let me tell you something I</p>
<p>know for a fact that he pays a great</p>
<p>deal more for the ingredients that go</p>
<p>into all these various supplements</p>
<p>because I hate to call you obsessive doc</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s what it is you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to put out a rotten product and</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re in Karen&rsquo;s health is</p>
<p>reflective of that and John from</p>
<p>Ethiopia talked about it but it really</p>
<p>is I can assure you folks that he um is</p>
<p>not looking to just slap but Dr Burgess</p>
<p>not looking to slap a label on a bottle</p>
<p>and get out there he really scrutinizes</p>
<p>over it and you know I&rsquo;m a benefactor of</p>
<p>many of his supplements you know I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>nutritional yeast freak and so on but</p>
<p>anyway thank you for that Dr Berg and I</p>
<p>I just got to throw that in because</p>
<p>again I see the inner workings of the</p>
<p>company and I know what he goes to to</p>
<p>put out these products and it ain&rsquo;t</p>
<p>nothing like the other people just sort</p>
<p>of slaying the uh you know foreign</p>
<p>ingredients and put a label on and call</p>
<p>it great</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s see uh we&rsquo;ve got a quiz</p>
<p>question answer and the first quiz</p>
<p>question was uh what is the most</p>
<p>important anti-stress hormone in the</p>
<p>body and our uh</p>
<p>our audience 65 of them say melatonin</p>
<p>thirty percent say serotonin and five</p>
<p>percent say insulin</p>
<p>wow</p>
<p>um you know you guys are are close but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s oxytocin now um</p>
<p>oxytocin normally</p>
<p>you know is related to</p>
<p>the birthing process with the</p>
<p>contraction of the uterus the lactation</p>
<p>the bonding between a mother and a baby</p>
<p>but I recently did a whole Deep dive in</p>
<p>oxytocin which blew me away it has also</p>
<p>a huge factor in regulating</p>
<p>um cortisol and stress and um</p>
<p>um buffering your stress response and so</p>
<p>in a video that I&rsquo;m going to release</p>
<p>very soon I&rsquo;m going to show you how to</p>
<p>trigger oxytocin and it has nothing to</p>
<p>do with nutrition</p>
<p>um they found um you know anything</p>
<p>social</p>
<p>um bonding with uh you know another</p>
<p>person</p>
<p>volunteering sharing something reading a</p>
<p>story like all these things that involve</p>
<p>helping another increase oxytocin which</p>
<p>is fascinating because if you ever think</p>
<p>about the last time you helped someone</p>
<p>were you stressed your stress went down</p>
<p>you would never think you would never</p>
<p>connect the dots there but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely um a therapy of just helping</p>
<p>in general which actually has a lot to</p>
<p>do with uh this you know one aspect just</p>
<p>the oxytocin from a physical standpoint</p>
<p>reducing your stress you know um so this</p>
<p>just kind of goes beyond just you know</p>
<p>getting on the right diet exercise that</p>
<p>type of thing but just stay tuned for</p>
<p>that video it&rsquo;s actually very very</p>
<p>interesting wonderful next question</p>
<p>doctor</p>
<p>okay what is the most important vitamin</p>
<p>in in preventing a stroke</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on an audience I know you have some</p>
<p>answers uh and here is</p>
<p>a good question and I just I just lost</p>
<p>it let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>oh here we go uh Jolie from YouTube</p>
<p>while we&rsquo;re fasting what should we do to</p>
<p>address the lack of minerals during this</p>
<p>period I have also been diagnosed with</p>
<p>oh my goodness breast cancer</p>
<p>you need to take minerals uh</p>
<p>electrolytes while you&rsquo;re fasting very</p>
<p>important so many people don&rsquo;t because</p>
<p>think about what&rsquo;s going to happen is</p>
<p>the first thing what happened first</p>
<p>thing that happens when you start</p>
<p>fasting is you&rsquo;re going to start to use</p>
<p>up your stored glycogen that is stored</p>
<p>um sugar okay in your liver and some in</p>
<p>the muscle as well okay so you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to use that up and then you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>start burning fat well guess what&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>the glycogen you got potassium</p>
<p>and so you&rsquo;re going to dump a lot of</p>
<p>um fluid because this glucose also holds</p>
<p>water so with that loss of glycogen</p>
<p>water you also lose potassium so if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not taking the potassium you can</p>
<p>end up with a deficiency especially if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t consume 10 cups of vegetables</p>
<p>a day like I do and um</p>
<p>and then so if you have cancer you</p>
<p>should watch my other videos on cancer</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of things you can do but</p>
<p>probably the most important thing you</p>
<p>can do is start doing prolonged fasting</p>
<p>immediately</p>
<p>depending on the severity of the cancer</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s say you had stage four if it</p>
<p>was me I would start with a 21 day fast</p>
<p>starting yesterday</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s more severe and you want to</p>
<p>you want to create the biggest impact</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other things to do but the</p>
<p>fasting is the most potent thing and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not too expensive</p>
<p>so um everyone can afford fasting</p>
<p>all right well I can&rsquo;t afford to give</p>
<p>out my observations on geography because</p>
<p>Terry says I&rsquo;m getting roasted on my</p>
<p>Denmark Netherlands remark he says two</p>
<p>different countries bro so I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>be very careful in the future before I</p>
<p>start slinging those Geographic areas</p>
<p>about but that&rsquo;s you learn something new</p>
<p>every day so by the way folks denmarket</p>
<p>is not part of the Netherlands thank you</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s go on Terry</p>
<p>also mentions that hugging also</p>
<p>increases oxytocin yes yes hugging does</p>
<p>so start of course yeah you know I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t suggest just start hugging</p>
<p>everyone out you know no matter who they</p>
<p>are just all day long because um you</p>
<p>know that comes with the package but I</p>
<p>would just hug those that um yeah</p>
<p>especially like even um</p>
<p>uh what&rsquo;s another thing that triggers</p>
<p>that um</p>
<p>you know I think volunteering for</p>
<p>something I was like wow that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting you&rsquo;re contributing to</p>
<p>something and you feel good about it and</p>
<p>your stress goes down so um it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>fascinating topic</p>
<p>fantastic well by the way when we do our</p>
<p>shout out to people all over the world I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s really fun that some other</p>
<p>people say hey what about us and Terry</p>
<p>is always on the side of the viewers so</p>
<p>he added a few more we&rsquo;ll do a shout out</p>
<p>to those joining us from Kurdistan</p>
<p>Vietnam Qatar</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have to spell that fromatically</p>
<p>with for me Terry Mumbai Ireland Croatia</p>
<p>Cambodia Papua New Guinea Jamaica Dubai</p>
<p>Serbia and Slovakia so thanks everybody</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t forget about any of you and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll continue to give you shout outs as</p>
<p>you pop on here okay let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>pitcam from YouTube can you please</p>
<p>discuss the effect of black seed oil as</p>
<p>a way to strengthen our immune system</p>
<p>any comment on that doc</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really good one black seed oil</p>
<p>is a potent</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory I mean the list goes</p>
<p>on and on and on</p>
<p>anti-microbial</p>
<p>anti-cancer it helps to regulate um</p>
<p>estrogen metabolism</p>
<p>um it helps to balance your endocrine</p>
<p>system it&rsquo;s it does a lot of things so</p>
<p>if you have access to that I would take</p>
<p>that on a regular basis</p>
<p>um as I might if you&rsquo;re watching my</p>
<p>videos you may have noticed that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>kind of just talking a little bit more</p>
<p>about DNA and some of the DNA testing</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m doing a huge Deep dive um</p>
<p>fascinating fascinating topic</p>
<p>um but</p>
<p>what that&rsquo;s about and stay tuned for</p>
<p>um a better explanation with that but if</p>
<p>you um check your genes and you can find</p>
<p>the most important areas for you</p>
<p>personally to focus on because</p>
<p>your genes have been given to you by</p>
<p>your ancestors and uh and there are</p>
<p>certain genes that um are permanent but</p>
<p>other genes are not and your environment</p>
<p>has a lot to do with and your epigenetic</p>
<p>factors have a lot to do with whether</p>
<p>these genes are going to be expressed or</p>
<p>not so for me uh personally my greatest</p>
<p>weakness is in in the inflammatory genes</p>
<p>I mean they&rsquo;re just like the worst of</p>
<p>the worst so what does that mean</p>
<p>it means that um I shouldn&rsquo;t probably go</p>
<p>out drinking each night right I should</p>
<p>probably not consume the bread pasta</p>
<p>cereal crackers biscuits so um and I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t I load up with um a lot of the</p>
<p>phytonutrients</p>
<p>from my if my diet from my huge salads</p>
<p>and things like that I have a very wide</p>
<p>range to build up my microbiome also I</p>
<p>do a lot of omega-6 foods and oils that</p>
<p>the cobbler oil and so</p>
<p>um also I got to be careful not to over</p>
<p>train I&rsquo;ve been guilty of that so</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s just a lot of things once you</p>
<p>find out about your personal weaknesses</p>
<p>then you can</p>
<p>kind of change your lifestyle geared to</p>
<p>that so you don&rsquo;t end up with a problem</p>
<p>down the road so it gives you kind of</p>
<p>some prediction on what problems you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have whether it&rsquo;s Alzheimer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cancer whatever so I&rsquo;m going to be um</p>
<p>doing a lot of videos and also recommend</p>
<p>where to get a good test and all that</p>
<p>very soon but I will say it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a complex subject and to understand</p>
<p>it you have to it takes time and so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m dig digging through it but um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost there very good okay audience</p>
<p>is astute is always in getting the next</p>
<p>answer in for quiz question number two</p>
<p>which asks what is the most important</p>
<p>vitamin in preventing Strokes</p>
<p>and our audience said 45 at least uh say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s K2 30 say vitamin D and 25 say</p>
<p>Omega-3s and then the uh the last five</p>
<p>percent say vitamin C</p>
<p>well if you notice I said vitamin</p>
<p>someone said omega-3 which is uh it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>nutrient it&rsquo;s not a vitamin but um</p>
<p>the answer is the most important one</p>
<p>would be by the mini in the form of</p>
<p>tocatrinos which is literally</p>
<p>probably between a hundred to a thousand</p>
<p>times</p>
<p>more potent than the regular tocopherol</p>
<p>so you want the tocatrinals</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want the tuck off roll so what</p>
<p>does that do well first of all</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a driver to help you absorb</p>
<p>more omega-3</p>
<p>with DHA</p>
<p>which is important</p>
<p>um and also it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a very powerful</p>
<p>antioxidant so it it can actually go in</p>
<p>there and help</p>
<p>um with the damage during</p>
<p>um The Stroke after and even as a</p>
<p>preventative so if you&rsquo;re actually if</p>
<p>you had a stroke and you&rsquo;re rehabbing</p>
<p>that you should you better be taking</p>
<p>tocadrino&rsquo;s because that&rsquo;s uh the</p>
<p>research on that is tremendous</p>
<p>especially what it can do to prevent the</p>
<p>fibrosis and the other stuff that comes</p>
<p>after you get a stroke the problem with</p>
<p>the stroke is that</p>
<p>um you get lack of blood supply to an</p>
<p>area</p>
<p>um and then if you get in time of course</p>
<p>you want to call 9-1-1 and there are</p>
<p>certain drugs that they can dissolve and</p>
<p>you know get if you get it within like</p>
<p>three or four hours but you know a mini</p>
<p>stroke is something that you it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a residual but a severe stroke does</p>
<p>so that tocotrino is like a really</p>
<p>important thing</p>
<p>um take</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>during and after as well as before</p>
<p>my my whole thing is that&rsquo;s all real</p>
<p>great but let&rsquo;s go for preventing a</p>
<p>stroke in the first place and that would</p>
<p>be changing your diet and um and eating</p>
<p>correctly so I have videos on that that</p>
<p>would be like the smartest thing to do</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re unwilling to change your</p>
<p>ways then you should be taking other</p>
<p>things to counter some of the the damage</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s occurring</p>
<p>from your diet very good okay speaking</p>
<p>of Strokes maybe this next question uh</p>
<p>delves into that issue Dr Berg</p>
<p>okay so what is the most important</p>
<p>vitamin involved in lowering cholesterol</p>
<p>folks get on that and here&rsquo;s a problem</p>
<p>that probably all of us have from time</p>
<p>to time a letter from YouTube I have a</p>
<p>problem with hair loss from long-term</p>
<p>stress and family problems what can I do</p>
<p>to save my remaining hair</p>
<p>that is um</p>
<p>boy that&rsquo;s a Common Thread with all the</p>
<p>different types of</p>
<p>things that can cause hair loss I mean</p>
<p>because the stress depletion of</p>
<p>nutrients</p>
<p>the stress activates cortisol and burns</p>
<p>out the follicles in fact a stress event</p>
<p>can cause hair loss that&rsquo;s delayed up to</p>
<p>three months so it&rsquo;s hard to connect the</p>
<p>dots so um you know what you want to do</p>
<p>is watch my video on oxytocin</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s coming up real soon</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>which is fascinating</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s related to stress and then do</p>
<p>things to reduce stress and cortisol so</p>
<p>um of course</p>
<p>go for long walks a regular</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>exercise without over training uh</p>
<p>sleeping a little bit more being out in</p>
<p>the sun eating a healthy Keto Plan is</p>
<p>all going to help you reduce stress and</p>
<p>also fasting intermittent fasting for</p>
<p>sure and then also take the nutrients</p>
<p>that stress is involved in depleting</p>
<p>like the zinc the vitamin C</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so these are real key factors and also</p>
<p>vitamin D</p>
<p>good old vitamins a lot of things yeah</p>
<p>okay sounds great and next coming to us</p>
<p>from Denmark not the Netherlands uh is</p>
<p>uh pause pause you&rsquo;re on with Dr Berg</p>
<p>make sure you&rsquo;re unmuted</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t hear you yet</p>
<p>and unmute yourself her mic is muted so</p>
<p>she just needs to unmute her mic because</p>
<p>I can see it&rsquo;s muted all right there she</p>
<p>goes there we go there we go okay no can</p>
<p>you hear me yes</p>
<p>hi Dr bed I&rsquo;m so happy</p>
<p>already submit</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so excited I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m very very</p>
<p>grateful to be here with you because you</p>
<p>you change my horses in my life</p>
<p>four years ago since we&rsquo;re doing your</p>
<p>keto diet</p>
<p>my husband had a diabetes but now we</p>
<p>reverse it and have a healthy life and</p>
<p>more strong and everything is positive</p>
<p>so thank you very much that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>okay was that is that your comment do</p>
<p>you have a question</p>
<p>with that thing I&rsquo;m going through this I</p>
<p>have a friend a very good friend who has</p>
<p>a problem with gold and gold bladder</p>
<p>stones</p>
<p>on a inside and high and enzymes right</p>
<p>and the doctor wants to take off the</p>
<p>gallbladder next month okay and I</p>
<p>introduced time to the keto diet she</p>
<p>said doing it and she had good result</p>
<p>and everything but</p>
<p>suddenly she can continue eating into</p>
<p>the diet because the doctor asked her to</p>
<p>stop to quit from the diet because he</p>
<p>said the the keto diet is not a good</p>
<p>diet to being while you have good little</p>
<p>Stone and deficiency of of a bile salt</p>
<p>okay pause uh let&rsquo;s get an answer from</p>
<p>Dr Berg</p>
<p>yeah so well you know</p>
<p>might as well go all the way and just</p>
<p>remove the gallbladder and the liver</p>
<p>because the liver produces bile and that</p>
<p>way you completely eliminate the problem</p>
<p>um remember coming back</p>
<p>um here&rsquo;s the thing um honestly I would</p>
<p>scope out some other doctors that can</p>
<p>look at the bigger picture</p>
<p>um people associate the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s a high fat diet well it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to necessarily be just a</p>
<p>high fat it can be a quality fat and it</p>
<p>can be low carb which is very beneficial</p>
<p>think about this what&rsquo;s the alternative</p>
<p>a higher carbohydrate diet which</p>
<p>actually creates some more problems for</p>
<p>the gallbladder</p>
<p>um if he&rsquo;s concerned about fats then why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you just um not add additional</p>
<p>fats to the ketogenic diet and then add</p>
<p>some bile salts and choline and those</p>
<p>two right there will keep the bile nice</p>
<p>and thinned and happy and flowing freely</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>you know I had gallbladder problems very</p>
<p>severely and I&rsquo;ve been on the ketogenic</p>
<p>diet for um</p>
<p>a very long time and um before the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet what did I have oh pain</p>
<p>underneath my right rib cage severe</p>
<p>gallbladder problems so</p>
<p>um it just doesn&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>what the healthy version of the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet is it could be very</p>
<p>beneficial because even if you think</p>
<p>about bile itself what triggers the</p>
<p>release of bile which happens to help</p>
<p>you dissolve Stones it&rsquo;s fat it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>saturated fat now you say well wait a</p>
<p>second I thought fats are bad for the</p>
<p>gallbladder well only if you take them</p>
<p>with carbohydrates and and also you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t tolerate it so if you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>from a low fat to a high fat maybe you</p>
<p>just do it slowly so your body can adapt</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>you know you don&rsquo;t have to go crazy with</p>
<p>the fats with the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>um but um if you can&rsquo;t digest them just</p>
<p>you add things to help your digest them</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>um find another doctor who really is can</p>
<p>work with you</p>
<p>well pause thank you so much for that</p>
<p>question and it speaks volumes about you</p>
<p>that you would be interested in your</p>
<p>friend&rsquo;s Health after you&rsquo;ve already</p>
<p>benefited so much and here&rsquo;s another and</p>
<p>boy I&rsquo;m so excited Carrie&rsquo;s been bashing</p>
<p>me to get a graphic produce forever and</p>
<p>here it is so for people like paws she</p>
<p>can tell her friend about the Dr Berg</p>
<p>app that&rsquo;s now available uh both on the</p>
<p>App Store Apple&rsquo;s App Store and Google</p>
<p>play so get that and you will have a</p>
<p>source of knowledge Second To None on</p>
<p>your phone in your pocket all the time</p>
<p>and by the way they Dr Berg held back a</p>
<p>little bit until he made sure that all</p>
<p>the sort of little kinks are out of it</p>
<p>so that you can really go on there and</p>
<p>dig down and find the video that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking for which apparently according</p>
<p>to Dr Burke is very difficult to do on</p>
<p>YouTube sometimes so Dr Berg do you have</p>
<p>any uh wonderful things to say about</p>
<p>your app well I created the app because</p>
<p>I was like having a hard time finding</p>
<p>certain things on my own channel so</p>
<p>um which is really weird this happened</p>
<p>like two years ago and I remember</p>
<p>October I started searching I&rsquo;m like I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t even find these videos they&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>there</p>
<p>um but I&rsquo;m like not showing up so um</p>
<p>created the app and then that way you</p>
<p>can have the resources</p>
<p>um if you need them like if you want to</p>
<p>do a quick search it just pops right up</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s a free app check it out I</p>
<p>and you know what if you don&rsquo;t like it</p>
<p>please let us know why because give us</p>
<p>feedback if you like it let us know why</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m constantly trying to improve it</p>
<p>and um so it&rsquo;s just another little uh</p>
<p>resource for you and also just just as</p>
<p>an FYI we&rsquo;re doing something on our</p>
<p>website it&rsquo;s called The 12 Days of</p>
<p>Christmas starting today if you live in</p>
<p>the U.S it&rsquo;s free shipping today if you</p>
<p>wanted to check that out</p>
<p>um of course we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>um offering that in Europe because of</p>
<p>the expense but anyway I just want to</p>
<p>throw that out and um each day we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have a different</p>
<p>nice little surprise for you so stay</p>
<p>tuned for that have fun okay quiz</p>
<p>question number three ask what is the</p>
<p>most important vitamin involved in</p>
<p>lowering cholesterol</p>
<p>and Terry</p>
<p>ferreted out the answer which is 55</p>
<p>percent say some form of vitamin D 35</p>
<p>say niacin five percent say vitamin B</p>
<p>B3 and five percent say vitamin C</p>
<p>okay it&rsquo;s the answer is niacin that&rsquo;s B3</p>
<p>so a lot of you were correct niacin um</p>
<p>is quite quite fantastic I mean what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>shocked is this you know this is not</p>
<p>like on the front page of the news while</p>
<p>I know why it&rsquo;s just there&rsquo;s no money in</p>
<p>it but there is some hardcore data that</p>
<p>niacin literally not just regulates</p>
<p>cholesterol but it protects the inside</p>
<p>layer of your artery from oxidative</p>
<p>stress and oxidative cholesterol</p>
<p>oxidative LDL it can actually uh reverse</p>
<p>that I mean if you have heart problems I</p>
<p>mean you should be popping these niacin</p>
<p>through the day you can get a 500</p>
<p>milligram time release and you know um</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get the one that</p>
<p>um is like a no flush you actually want</p>
<p>the flushing response if that bothers</p>
<p>you then take smaller amounts of it</p>
<p>starting out to gradually increase it</p>
<p>over time but boy what it does for your</p>
<p>um your heart is amazing amazing on many</p>
<p>different levels so I just want to point</p>
<p>that out and so much research I was like</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t more people know about this</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>very good well here&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>question I&rsquo;m sure many people around the</p>
<p>world are on this odd schedule Kathy</p>
<p>from Facebook why</p>
<p>um oops let&rsquo;s say sorry Vanessa from</p>
<p>YouTube can I lead a healthy life</p>
<p>working from 11 30 P.M to 8 A.M what can</p>
<p>I do to improve my health with these</p>
<p>schedules you know a lot of times these</p>
<p>places you work like they&rsquo;ve got one</p>
<p>rotten sort of fast food vending machine</p>
<p>where you can get a you know a Snickers</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s about it so how can she plan</p>
<p>and survive that</p>
<p>what was it what was the time frame it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what 11 30 p.m just before midnight to 8</p>
<p>A.M in the morning okay yeah so um so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a rotational uh shift night shift</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re gonna have to keep your</p>
<p>life</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>stable like in other words on the</p>
<p>weekends whatever you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>keep that unfortunately I wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>rotate it back because the rotation</p>
<p>really throws off the the Circadian</p>
<p>waves and Rhythm</p>
<p>um one thing I would add to that because</p>
<p>everything is just kind of like shifted</p>
<p>is to buy some type of um lighting like</p>
<p>a full spectrum light they have them</p>
<p>like these healing lights so you can</p>
<p>expose your</p>
<p>your eyes your your face to this natural</p>
<p>light uh sometime at night because</p>
<p>everything is reversed there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>things that are happening with with what</p>
<p>the sun gives us and the Darkness gives</p>
<p>us so you&rsquo;re just gonna have to cope</p>
<p>with that it&rsquo;s a difficult situation</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to be taking vitamin D</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to help you as the most</p>
<p>important nutrient but</p>
<p>also get that light and maybe by your</p>
<p>desk you&rsquo;re exposing yourself to that</p>
<p>light</p>
<p>um you know for at least an hour a day</p>
<p>and then if you couldn&rsquo;t get out in the</p>
<p>sun too at some point</p>
<p>maybe when you&rsquo;re getting up or I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know before you go to bed I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;re going to do that but</p>
<p>that is a it&rsquo;s definitely a stress on</p>
<p>the body it&rsquo;s the stress on the immune</p>
<p>system so</p>
<p>yes all right well you know I really</p>
<p>like these questions I think and I think</p>
<p>I speak for the audience too you really</p>
<p>learn a lot of stuff and here&rsquo;s the next</p>
<p>one</p>
<p>okay what foods</p>
<p>uh what food is highest in quercetin</p>
<p>kercetin</p>
<p>leap on it</p>
<p>uh Haley it is interesting Juan from</p>
<p>YouTube can a high carb diet affect the</p>
<p>thyroid</p>
<p>yeah yeah it can because</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in high carbs you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>think about what&rsquo;s happening to your</p>
<p>metabolism right it&rsquo;s a completely</p>
<p>different metabolism</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s involving a lot more energy</p>
<p>um wasted energy then burning fat and so</p>
<p>the thyroid has to adjust and this is</p>
<p>why</p>
<p>um when you go on a low low carb diet</p>
<p>the thyroid does not have to work as</p>
<p>hard and so you&rsquo;re not going to require</p>
<p>it as much of that hormone</p>
<p>as you would if you&rsquo;re on the high carb</p>
<p>diet as long as you&rsquo;re getting all the</p>
<p>nutrients okay</p>
<p>uh you&rsquo;ll be fine to do the ketogenic</p>
<p>diet so that&rsquo;s why I always recommend</p>
<p>the healthy version of the ketogenic</p>
<p>diet all right very good let&rsquo;s go back</p>
<p>to our green room and Jennifer is from</p>
<p>Manila in the Philippines and I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to unmute you Jennifer and uh hang on</p>
<p>just a second like that and we&rsquo;re asking</p>
<p>for your one question to Dr Byrd</p>
<p>yes hi good morning good afternoon good</p>
<p>evening to all the the to everyone</p>
<p>watching</p>
<p>um first I&rsquo;d like to thank you Dr Berg</p>
<p>and your team for this opportunity so</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s my concern</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;d like to ask how should I respond</p>
<p>to doctors um well I&rsquo;m diabetic and how</p>
<p>should I my question is I&rsquo;d like to ask</p>
<p>how should I respond to doctors who</p>
<p>warned me about diabetic ketoacidosis</p>
<p>and those who really</p>
<p>tell me</p>
<p>um to take statins because of my high</p>
<p>LDL but I have low triglycerides and</p>
<p>high HDL they say because I&rsquo;m diabetic</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m more prone to</p>
<p>um so all those hard problems</p>
<p>so are you a type one or type two</p>
<p>okay so I would go to the virta website</p>
<p>Verda website it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a group that</p>
<p>even certain insurances are are will</p>
<p>help lower your payments if you um if</p>
<p>you do their program I mean they have</p>
<p>some great documentation that&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>medical oriented more research that you</p>
<p>can then show your doctor because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I mean unfortunately</p>
<p>uh some of these doctors are not as</p>
<p>flexible in their thinking as we would</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>um I mean the bottom line is if I were</p>
<p>going up to a doctor I&rsquo;d say so you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t recommend the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>because of uh and I&rsquo;m a diabetic well</p>
<p>let me ask you this so what is diabetes</p>
<p>and see what they say what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>definition of diabetes Well it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>state or condition where you have high</p>
<p>sugar in the blood so why when lowering</p>
<p>the sugar be a beneficial thing</p>
<p>and see what they say I mean this is</p>
<p>like so a seven-year-old could</p>
<p>understand that um so then</p>
<p>um the next question is what about the</p>
<p>ketoacidosis which would only occur if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re a type one and you fail</p>
<p>to take your insulin</p>
<p>but going on a ketogenic diet is is</p>
<p>going to raise your ketones but not</p>
<p>sorry about that</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>not in the level of um</p>
<p>not in to the level of being dangerous</p>
<p>which is like like you know 8 9 10 11</p>
<p>12.</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;d be lucky if you get them up to</p>
<p>three or four so there&rsquo;s a thing called</p>
<p>nutritional ketosis you should look it</p>
<p>up and you just need the doctors just</p>
<p>need to be educated on that that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>very therapeutic thing what do you think</p>
<p>they did before they had insulin they</p>
<p>did low carbs they did this but then</p>
<p>they invented insulin and or discovered</p>
<p>it and then now</p>
<p>um they don&rsquo;t really focus on that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the only time you&rsquo;re going to get</p>
<p>ketoacidosis if you if you have a if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating a lot of carbs whatever</p>
<p>and then you don&rsquo;t take insulin but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not taking insulin uh so you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to worry about it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually um and then also as far as the</p>
<p>statins go uh it is true that statins</p>
<p>will lower your cholesterol but</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily decrease your</p>
<p>risk of heart disease that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a lot of controversy on</p>
<p>the statins I would I would find some of</p>
<p>these books written by medical doctors</p>
<p>on the dangers of statins you can get</p>
<p>all that data because unfortunately I</p>
<p>still recommend it I mean if you took um</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not telling you not to take your</p>
<p>statins but if like red yeast extract</p>
<p>Works in a very similar way to statins</p>
<p>B3 niacin works very similar to statins</p>
<p>what about those those have virtually no</p>
<p>side effects</p>
<p>got it</p>
<p>well that sounds great well thanks for</p>
<p>representing you bet thanks for</p>
<p>representing Manila so well Jennifer and</p>
<p>thanks for hanging on being our last</p>
<p>Green Room caller uh now let&rsquo;s go back</p>
<p>to the quizzes and uh the latest one</p>
<p>which is the highest in</p>
<p>Kirsten did I say that right now yeah</p>
<p>which actually is good for um allergies</p>
<p>and uh histamines and all sorts of uh</p>
<p>things the audience knew what it was</p>
<p>because 66 percent uh say onions are</p>
<p>garlic 20 say cabbage and other</p>
<p>cruciferous vegetables and 14 per se</p>
<p>citrus fruits they&rsquo;re all over the place</p>
<p>there</p>
<p>okay well onions are</p>
<p>um probably one of the best sources</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>start including onions in your in your</p>
<p>diet um just yesterday I I love onions</p>
<p>and I put those onions right with my</p>
<p>eggs yesterday it was delicious so</p>
<p>um I could pretty much have onions every</p>
<p>single day and uh I recommend it all</p>
<p>right now that we&rsquo;ve crap cracked the uh</p>
<p>the Caper about onions let&rsquo;s go further</p>
<p>into that and this is a true falser our</p>
<p>one true falser for today</p>
<p>yeah so true or false raw onions provide</p>
<p>more kercetin than slightly cooked</p>
<p>onions</p>
<p>okay climb on that audience</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see here&rsquo;s another one that</p>
<p>affects a lot of people kele from</p>
<p>Facebook what is the best way to address</p>
<p>eczema eczema excuse me issues</p>
<p>yeah this is related to your gut and so</p>
<p>you have to fix the gut to fix the skin</p>
<p>and chances are you might be doing</p>
<p>not just gluten but maybe some weed</p>
<p>products that you have to eliminate and</p>
<p>probably eliminate Dairy and um and some</p>
<p>other allergy and start doing things to</p>
<p>support the gut</p>
<p>um cabbage I mean like sauerkraut is a</p>
<p>really good thing but you want to build</p>
<p>up your microbiome probably take a</p>
<p>probiotic and then watch my video on</p>
<p>bloating because I actually go into that</p>
<p>um the skin issues are I mean also you</p>
<p>want to take vitamin D</p>
<p>or like an anti-inflammatory but uh</p>
<p>eczema is a definitely a gut issue</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um you know they&rsquo;ve found even like</p>
<p>these like the Europe leaky gut these</p>
<p>little Junctions or these uh these</p>
<p>spaces in your in your intestine</p>
<p>um when you take like gluten they just</p>
<p>like open right up and they allow</p>
<p>all sorts of food that&rsquo;s shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>passing through that barrier that passed</p>
<p>right through or your immune system is</p>
<p>ready to go what the heck is that it</p>
<p>starts to tag these proteins</p>
<p>as pathogens and something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>foreign and now you now you are have new</p>
<p>allergies now you have</p>
<p>um antibodies against the wrong thing</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re more susceptible to</p>
<p>autoimmune problems</p>
<p>like Hashimoto&rsquo;s you know it&rsquo;s just um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a situation absolutely well this is</p>
<p>no fun Uma from Facebook please share</p>
<p>any advice for burning feet sensation at</p>
<p>night</p>
<p>simple simple simple simple solution you</p>
<p>just go out get something called</p>
<p>benphotamine which is a uh it&rsquo;s a B1</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a synthetic B1 which is one of the</p>
<p>only synthetics I recommend</p>
<p>um and that B1 helps to heal the nerves</p>
<p>usually the products with benphotamine</p>
<p>also have alpha lipoic acid and so</p>
<p>either one of those are good but I like</p>
<p>the benphotamine</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and sometimes with the alpha lipoic acid</p>
<p>you take that and it&rsquo;s really good to</p>
<p>help your nerves which usually come from</p>
<p>either diabetic situation or what can</p>
<p>come from other things too but it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a simple solution it works</p>
<p>very well</p>
<p>very good and the audience works very</p>
<p>well they&rsquo;re ripping through these</p>
<p>questions as I said we have six today</p>
<p>instead of five and by golly we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to get through them and this latest one</p>
<p>asked or is a true falser uh true false</p>
<p>raw onions provide more curcitin than</p>
<p>slightly cooked vegetables in our</p>
<p>audience uh 55 of them say no way that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>false 45 is true</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s false</p>
<p>when you slightly cook these onions you</p>
<p>get a a little bump</p>
<p>um you get a little increase and so so</p>
<p>like maybe six to twenty five percent</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>but you know eat them raw too but you</p>
<p>get a little bit more so it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>like with the garlic right you have to</p>
<p>and also sulforaphane which is in um</p>
<p>um broccoli Sprouts you have to crunch</p>
<p>them and break them open to release an</p>
<p>enzyme that then makes this active</p>
<p>compound active well same thing with the</p>
<p>onions okay very good uh and speaking of</p>
<p>onions this is the onion show and here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>our last question for the day doc</p>
<p>okay which type of onion has the least</p>
<p>quercetin red onion yellow onion or</p>
<p>white onion</p>
<p>all right now let&rsquo;s go back to social</p>
<p>media John from Facebook how do you feel</p>
<p>about Citrus Bergamot to lower I hope I</p>
<p>said that right to lower cholesterol</p>
<p>Citrus Bergamot I think I think it&rsquo;s a I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a great remedy um but also at</p>
<p>the same time you know you want to cut</p>
<p>out cut out the carbs which actually</p>
<p>inevitably raise things so um if you</p>
<p>have also a genetic problem related to</p>
<p>fats in general</p>
<p>um if you have a weakness within an area</p>
<p>you know you want to add choline you</p>
<p>want to add some of the B vitamins you</p>
<p>want to add</p>
<p>um things like um</p>
<p>bile salts</p>
<p>so and niacin there&rsquo;s a lot of things</p>
<p>you can do depending on your situation</p>
<p>but typically that is a good remedy for</p>
<p>um what what you want to do</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific let&rsquo;s see now Kathy from</p>
<p>Facebook why is it that cruciferous</p>
<p>vegetables bother me uh badly extremely</p>
<p>gassy reactions help</p>
<p>yeah well there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>dysbiosis or this imbalance of some</p>
<p>microbe in in your gut that you know</p>
<p>these microbes are supposed to help you</p>
<p>break down uh this fiber but um</p>
<p>sometimes we don&rsquo;t have the microbes</p>
<p>um there so then when you eat these</p>
<p>things and boy it just it tears us up</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not digested and then</p>
<p>what happens is you have this over</p>
<p>fermentation problem so then we get uh</p>
<p>too much gas uh different types of gas</p>
<p>and then we have pressure and then so</p>
<p>um you just have to avoid them right now</p>
<p>and then slowly increase them in the</p>
<p>diet over a long period of time so your</p>
<p>body can adapt to digesting this there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one cruciferous vegetable that I cannot</p>
<p>eat or I will be in so much pain that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>broccoli</p>
<p>um but I can do cabbage I can do other</p>
<p>ones and of course if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>um brussels sprouts I would we need</p>
<p>those raw if I were you I would cook</p>
<p>them or steam them but but yeah so if</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>the cruciferous do other vegetables like</p>
<p>salad and things like that if you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do that go on the carnivore for a while</p>
<p>but you know our bodies will eventually</p>
<p>adapt to certain things</p>
<p>um if you give it enough time</p>
<p>but if your genetics</p>
<p>have been adapting for thousands of</p>
<p>years in a certain way it may take</p>
<p>a few thousand years to get them back to</p>
<p>where where they need to be depending on</p>
<p>the environment or what what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing but in the meantime</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a lot of things you can</p>
<p>do to cope with the problem</p>
<p>okay my sounding the klaxon that means</p>
<p>that the audience has done absolutely</p>
<p>incredible with their homework because</p>
<p>they just answered six questions we</p>
<p>usually have trouble getting through</p>
<p>five and it asks the final one which</p>
<p>type of onion has the least curcitin red</p>
<p>yellow or white I&rsquo;m such a fan of red</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t say red instead they said 60</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s white onions 40 say it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>yellow ones</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the white because it&rsquo;s lacking a</p>
<p>pigment</p>
<p>and these phytonutrients especially</p>
<p>curcitin is a it&rsquo;s an it&rsquo;s a pigment</p>
<p>which is a antioxidant pigment just like</p>
<p>a lot of the other ones anthraxanthins</p>
<p>carotenoids pigments</p>
<p>so um this is why</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know like the dark uh purple beets</p>
<p>or carrots or these uh different color</p>
<p>type vegetables are are good</p>
<p>um but yeah I mean still do the white</p>
<p>ones but if you do the yellow red ones</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just you get a little bit more of</p>
<p>that nutrient which is uh very</p>
<p>interesting and I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m doing some</p>
<p>I have a device</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing some research on this I have a</p>
<p>whole team of people helping me but um</p>
<p>so I want to find out</p>
<p>how can we grow</p>
<p>food that is higher in some of these</p>
<p>phytonutrients</p>
<p>and a lot of it of the past research has</p>
<p>to do with it really depends on the</p>
<p>microbes in the</p>
<p>around the seed when you&rsquo;re growing it</p>
<p>as well as in the soil so we&rsquo;ll do a</p>
<p>whole research I&rsquo;ll do a whole video on</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>um because it&rsquo;s a fascinating topic and</p>
<p>uh you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s related to a</p>
<p>couple things and one thing one variable</p>
<p>is the microbes another variable is the</p>
<p>sunlight so if you&rsquo;re growing in a</p>
<p>greenhouse with a certain growing lamp</p>
<p>versus out in the sun completely</p>
<p>different</p>
<p>um phytonutrient Spectrum so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very interesting subject all</p>
<p>right here&rsquo;s something interesting</p>
<p>Jillian from YouTube would nut Rod work</p>
<p>in my morning coffee in lieu of butter</p>
<p>while I&rsquo;m fasting it has zero carbs and</p>
<p>a couple of grams of fat</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;d be fine I think it&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>fine</p>
<p>all right have at it and let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>Elaine from uh YouTube we&rsquo;re back to</p>
<p>nice and how much niacin should we be</p>
<p>taking on a daily basis</p>
<p>I would take 500 milligrams of time</p>
<p>release</p>
<p>and you know there&rsquo;s not a lot of</p>
<p>options as far as the type of niacin out</p>
<p>there so</p>
<p>um they pretty much all come from the</p>
<p>same company so I would I would take it</p>
<p>it seems to work regardless of the the</p>
<p>type on that particular vitamin but</p>
<p>niacin um niacin is also good for um</p>
<p>schizophrenia too and um even bipolar</p>
<p>and even depression</p>
<p>um so yeah it&rsquo;s a real key key nutrient</p>
<p>for a lot of problems very good I love</p>
<p>these handles high five from YouTube can</p>
<p>the use of Moringa help with the effects</p>
<p>of IBS</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know I don&rsquo;t know uh you might</p>
<p>want to try it Moringa Moringa comes</p>
<p>from a a leaf from a tree</p>
<p>um and so you can actually even grow it</p>
<p>too it grows</p>
<p>very easily but it&rsquo;s a really nutrient</p>
<p>packed plant I mean a leaf so</p>
<p>um will it help your gut I don&rsquo;t know I</p>
<p>do know for example</p>
<p>fiber might aggravate the gut if you</p>
<p>have pre-existing damage so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really important so if some people can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>tolerate like vegetables because they</p>
<p>have already have existing damage from</p>
<p>the seed oils that they consumed so um</p>
<p>one thing that I do is I do my</p>
<p>wheatgrass juice powder added with water</p>
<p>in there because that has the benefit of</p>
<p>the chlorophyll without the fiber</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really good to help heal the</p>
<p>inner skin of the intestinal tract all</p>
<p>right very good Charlene from YouTube</p>
<p>represents a great many people in the</p>
<p>populace women in this case what</p>
<p>supplements would you recommend for</p>
<p>someone who is post-menopausal</p>
<p>probably the most important one would be</p>
<p>starting with vitamin E</p>
<p>um because that&rsquo;s going to that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>they lose from um having the loss of</p>
<p>ovaries so the vitamin E would be good I</p>
<p>would get in the tocotrinos that would</p>
<p>really help make sure you don&rsquo;t take a</p>
<p>lot of calcium okay because so that can</p>
<p>be a problem I would get the calcium</p>
<p>from the food but and then I would also</p>
<p>do the Omega uh three these the omega-3</p>
<p>I would say like cod liver oil that</p>
<p>would be good and definitely start</p>
<p>eliminating the omega-6 very very</p>
<p>important</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and then kind of go from there but that</p>
<p>that would be important</p>
<p>um without having any further data</p>
<p>all right very good and let&rsquo;s go back</p>
<p>and brag about this app again uh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>free how many things are free well this</p>
<p>is and uh it&rsquo;ll really keep you in tune</p>
<p>you have an absolute like an old Star</p>
<p>Trek tricorder my goodness you can</p>
<p>answer any question for your friends you</p>
<p>want and</p>
<p>um you know it&rsquo;s like pause right he was</p>
<p>kind enough to come on and talk about</p>
<p>her friend who was ailing well get them</p>
<p>to download this app and great things</p>
<p>will happen I noticed you mentioned Dr</p>
<p>Berg that they can&rsquo;t offer free shipping</p>
<p>internationally but you do have some</p>
<p>remedies for the high cost of shipping I</p>
<p>believe</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the products that I have and in Europe</p>
<p>are definitely do not have maltodextrin</p>
<p>I can promise you that so that&rsquo;s one big</p>
<p>plus thing</p>
<p>um but a lot of the products people are</p>
<p>taking in Europe are taking maltodextrin</p>
<p>unknowingly and um</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m just going to keep</p>
<p>increasing the awareness so more and</p>
<p>more companies will start to get that</p>
<p>darn</p>
<p>terrible ingredient out of the products</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s unnecessary but it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>difficult to find companies that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have it in there because</p>
<p>um you know you have to pay more not to</p>
<p>have it in there but they use it because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it makes a great spray and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cheap and um but think about where it</p>
<p>comes from you know it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>a starch and usually from corn or wheat</p>
<p>which people have allergies to things</p>
<p>like that so it&rsquo;s just not it&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>good product I think what I want to do</p>
<p>Steve is I want to go to the grocery</p>
<p>store</p>
<p>and I want to</p>
<p>um I want to look at all the products</p>
<p>and then have like a little chart to</p>
<p>determine</p>
<p>how much of their products are really</p>
<p>have maltodextrin in them and and also</p>
<p>grains and uh just do a deep dive on</p>
<p>that because I you can see what a lot of</p>
<p>people are consuming a lot of grains and</p>
<p>how do I know that we&rsquo;ll just go to the</p>
<p>grocery store look what look what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>selling</p>
<p>um but there&rsquo;s a lot of other hidden</p>
<p>things in the food so it&rsquo;s becoming more</p>
<p>difficult to find healthy food at the</p>
<p>local grocery store</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and on that note</p>
<p>um stay tuned for some really</p>
<p>interesting videos coming up this next</p>
<p>week as well as we will come Ravine next</p>
<p>Monday I&rsquo;m sorry next Friday at our</p>
<p>regular time at 11 o&rsquo;clock</p>
<p>uh Eastern Standard Time in the morning</p>
<p>so have a wonderful weekend uh coming up</p>
<p>here and we will talk to everyone real</p>
<p>soon</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
