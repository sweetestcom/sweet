    <p>Everett Fish was the reserve officer who passed 20B Road.</p>
<p>The dirt roads off the highway aren&rsquo;t well marked, and it&rsquo;s easy to do.</p>
<p>I even missed it my first time up there.</p>
<p>It took about .2 seconds for him to realize what he&rsquo;d done and make a U-turn back toward the Hulse House,</p>
<p>which was just a stone&rsquo;s throw away from the highway with a cornfield and a barn between.</p>
<p>The first thing Officer Fish did when he pulled up was look for any cars or suspicious activity.</p>
<p>And keep in mind, Officer Fish didn&rsquo;t know much yet.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d just been told that there was possibly an armed robbery at the house with a woman inside.</p>
<p>When he finally pulled up, he didn&rsquo;t see any cars at the house,</p>
<p>so he got on his radio and relayed that to Marshall County authorities.</p>
<p>Then Officer Fish got out of his police car, grabbed his shotgun from the backseat,</p>
<p>and as he walked toward the house, he noticed something.</p>
<p>On the ground in front of the house was blood.</p>
<p>A long trail of it that led from the driveway right up to the front door.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when he got back on his radio and was like,</p>
<p>hey, whatever this was, it&rsquo;s more than that now,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not looking good, so I&rsquo;m going to need some backup.</p>
<p>And just then, he heard something so foreign in that moment,</p>
<p>the last thing he ever expected to hear.</p>
<p>It was a baby crying.</p>
<p>Officer Fish approached the front door, and before opening it,</p>
<p>Officer Fish approached the front door, and before opening it,</p>
<p>he called out, announcing himself as police.</p>
<p>But there was no response, just more crying.</p>
<p>Fish knew he couldn&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>He threw open the front door and stepped inside.</p>
<p>This is Episode 2, A Stranger&rsquo;s Wrath.</p>
<p>Officer Fish was shocked when he opened the door</p>
<p>and found a crying baby in just a diaper and covered in blood.</p>
<p>But not her blood, it seemed.</p>
<p>You see, Officer Fish was also a trained EMT,</p>
<p>so he was able to discern just by doing a once-over</p>
<p>that the baby was okay.</p>
<p>Yes, she was covered in blood, but she didn&rsquo;t have any obvious wounds,</p>
<p>and there didn&rsquo;t seem to be any fresh bleeding.</p>
<p>He also thought it was a good sign that she was crying,</p>
<p>because that meant she was breathing fine.</p>
<p>But just to be safe, he radioed for an ambulance to come right away,</p>
<p>both for the baby and for whoever was taken out of the home</p>
<p>if they could find them.</p>
<p>And Fish knew they needed to find them soon.</p>
<p>Just from the looks of things, that person lost a lot of blood.</p>
<p>They had to be seriously hurt, if not already dead.</p>
<p>The blood trail he found outside extended into the house,</p>
<p>from the front door to the living room carpet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the brunt of the attack seemed to have taken place,</p>
<p>because there were streaks and small pools of blood in the carpet,</p>
<p>as well as smears on the slate tile by a wood stove near the front entrance.</p>
<p>And a struggle had clearly taken place,</p>
<p>because the stove&rsquo;s fireplace tools were scattered on the floor.</p>
<p>Within about three minutes, Lt. Ed Criswell from the sheriff&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>and Indiana State Police Trooper Dan Ringer got there.</p>
<p>Lt. Criswell took baby Kristen outside to meet the EMS crew,</p>
<p>and together, Ringer and Officer Fish started through the house</p>
<p>with guns drawn to see if anyone else was inside.</p>
<p>They checked every inch of the house.</p>
<p>The bathroom, bedrooms, closets, laundry room, kitchen,</p>
<p>even the basement, all clear.</p>
<p>Once they gave that all clear inside, other police units arrived</p>
<p>and checked the outside of the home, looking for anyone or anything.</p>
<p>But the outside left more clues than in,</p>
<p>because the blood trail stopped right at the driveway</p>
<p>where a car would have been parked.</p>
<p>And beyond the driveway in the road,</p>
<p>there was a skid mark pointing eastbound,</p>
<p>which is the opposite direction of the highway</p>
<p>and the opposite direction that the girls ran in.</p>
<p>If you leave the Holst house going that way,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really lead to anything.</p>
<p>I mean, if you look at the road from the house,</p>
<p>all you can see are trees and fields.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t any other houses.</p>
<p>But if you take that road, it just takes you east and then south</p>
<p>and then eventually feeds you out onto another highway, 110,</p>
<p>which, if you wanted, you can take 110 right back to 31,</p>
<p>and you can basically do a big square.</p>
<p>While some officers and detectives were formulating a plan</p>
<p>for how they were going to track down the vehicle and bring Darlene home,</p>
<p>others were charged with finding Darlene&rsquo;s husband, Ron Holst.</p>
<p>They phoned him at Young Door,</p>
<p>which was a door manufacturing company in the neighboring town of Plymouth.</p>
<p>And police basically just said something had happened at his house</p>
<p>and they were sending a unit to come get him.</p>
<p>Now, if they were coming to get him, Ron knew that it was bad.</p>
<p>So while he waited, he called his parents&rsquo; house.</p>
<p>I mean, they live just a stone&rsquo;s throw away,</p>
<p>so surely they knew what was happening.</p>
<p>His mom, Doris, answered, and she told him that the kids were OK,</p>
<p>but that police couldn&rsquo;t find Darlene.</p>
<p>I remember my dad coming through the door and him just sobbing.</p>
<p>Like, they&rsquo;ve got to find her, they&rsquo;ve got to find her.</p>
<p>He just kept mumbling stuff over and over again.</p>
<p>Like, he was just crying, absolutely crying.</p>
<p>And I just remember my dad saying,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to do everything we can to get her back,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to get her back, we&rsquo;re going to find her, we&rsquo;re going to find her.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, I would give up.</p>
<p>I remember he said to me, I would give up everything if we could find your mom.</p>
<p>He goes, I would give up all of this.</p>
<p>I just, I would give up everything I have to find your mom.</p>
<p>Like, why would they not find her?</p>
<p>I did not even process that it was more than that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get that she was in humongous danger.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get that she could go away and not come back.</p>
<p>It never really crossed my mind.</p>
<p>Seeing their dad, who was usually so reserved and in control,</p>
<p>break down like that was scary for the girls.</p>
<p>I mean, again, they were so little and they were confused.</p>
<p>And on top of all of that, they were uncomfortable.</p>
<p>There were police showing up at their grandparents&rsquo; house</p>
<p>wanting to talk to them about what had happened.</p>
<p>And there were also all these grown men standing around asking them questions</p>
<p>and they just wanted to go home and put on some damn clothes.</p>
<p>That feeling of being scared and vulnerable haunted them for a long time.</p>
<p>We were like, we need clothes.</p>
<p>I had a blanket on and I had nightmares for a very long time</p>
<p>about going places without clothes on.</p>
<p>Marie and Melissa told police what the man looked like</p>
<p>and described his car and pretty soon there were dozens of law enforcement agents</p>
<p>out searching for a green or bluish green early 70s rusty car</p>
<p>with a blonde man driving.</p>
<p>And that was the first issue.</p>
<p>What in the world color was this car?</p>
<p>And I know it sounds simple, but Marie and Melissa each saw something slightly different.</p>
<p>Marie called the car green and Melissa called it more blue.</p>
<p>Other witnesses that they would eventually talk to say light green,</p>
<p>maybe dark green with a light top.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent more time thinking about this car than I&rsquo;d like to admit.</p>
<p>But I think it bothers me so much because it seems so straightforward.</p>
<p>Was it blue or was it green?</p>
<p>I really focus on what the girl said.</p>
<p>A lot of people try and discount their recollection</p>
<p>or will tell you to take their accounts with a grain of salt</p>
<p>because they were so young and traumatized.</p>
<p>But I believe that car is burned into their brains.</p>
<p>Just how is it burned in, in two different colors?</p>
<p>One of us said it was like a pea green</p>
<p>and the other one said it was more like a blue green color from day one.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how that happened.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That frustrates me to this day that we couldn&rsquo;t agree on the color.</p>
<p>No one could have solved this whole color mystery.</p>
<p>Not some fancy equipment.</p>
<p>Run-of-the-mill paint swatches.</p>
<p>And so last year, that is exactly what we used</p>
<p>to get to the bottom of this 38-year-old enduring mystery.</p>
<p>Last time Emily met with Marie, Melissa and Kristen,</p>
<p>they were talking about this,</p>
<p>about how they both saw something different.</p>
<p>Marie actually whipped out one of those paint swatch fan decks</p>
<p>from her utility room</p>
<p>and they found the exact color that they both remember.</p>
<p>Now their memory hadn&rsquo;t changed.</p>
<p>That was the color and they both saw the same color.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s teal green.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s teal green.</p>
<p>The problem is that Melissa sees that color as a shade of blue</p>
<p>and Marie sees that as a shade of green.</p>
<p>We actually took a picture of the color that they agreed on</p>
<p>and you can see that on our website.</p>
<p>But this provided a ton of clarity</p>
<p>about the actual color of the suspect&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no one thought to do that in 1984.</p>
<p>So in the bulletin that went out to the area,</p>
<p>police called the car blue green.</p>
<p>That bulletin also included other details</p>
<p>that the girls remembered about the rust</p>
<p>and the old age of the car as well.</p>
<p>By mid-morning, dozens of officers were looking for that car</p>
<p>and that man,</p>
<p>but more importantly, Darlene.</p>
<p>At the same time they were searching,</p>
<p>technicians were collecting evidence from the Hulse home.</p>
<p>They recovered some bloody rocks near the front stoop.</p>
<p>On the front porch, they found some hair,</p>
<p>a piece of gray duct tape on the front step,</p>
<p>a white sock,</p>
<p>and just inside the door was a Nike tennis shoe</p>
<p>and another piece of duct tape.</p>
<p>In the dining room, they collected a smock</p>
<p>that had seemingly been ripped off Darlene in the struggle.</p>
<p>One of the buttons had flung over by the baby&rsquo;s crib</p>
<p>that was set up in the front room.</p>
<p>In the kitchen, investigators found the phone cord</p>
<p>that had been pulled out of the wall receiver.</p>
<p>They dusted for fingerprints on the phone receiver itself</p>
<p>but came up with nothing.</p>
<p>The bedrooms were mostly undisturbed</p>
<p>except for one small blood spot on Darlene&rsquo;s bed,</p>
<p>which was photographed and attributed to Kristen</p>
<p>looking around the house for her mother</p>
<p>when she was left alone.</p>
<p>They moved on to the fireplace tools</p>
<p>that were strewn about the front entrance of the house,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when they noticed something that they hadn&rsquo;t before.</p>
<p>A part of the fireplace poker was missing.</p>
<p>You know how wood fire stoves come with</p>
<p>basically this, like, carousel of tools?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s usually a shovel, a broom, tongs, poker,</p>
<p>well, the rod part of the poker was gone.</p>
<p>Their assumption was that the poker</p>
<p>was potentially what Darlene had been hit with.</p>
<p>Now, this was just a guess.</p>
<p>The girls had run from the house</p>
<p>before the man ever hit their mother,</p>
<p>and she wasn&rsquo;t bleeding when they left.</p>
<p>But if the officers were betting men,</p>
<p>they would have put money on it.</p>
<p>This meant that the killer hadn&rsquo;t come with a weapon.</p>
<p>This was a crime of opportunity,</p>
<p>for even if something was planned,</p>
<p>what was planned wasn&rsquo;t murder.</p>
<p>Things had clearly gotten out of control.</p>
<p>Darlene surprised her attacker</p>
<p>with more than he was bargaining for when he barged in,</p>
<p>and she must have made him angry</p>
<p>because what he was able to do to her</p>
<p>in the few minutes between the girls running from the home</p>
<p>and the attacker fleeing with Darlene spoke volumes,</p>
<p>and they had to find her now.</p>
<p>But in a town of 1,500 people,</p>
<p>the places an assailant could have taken Darlene were limited.</p>
<p>Police went scouring nearby fields</p>
<p>and checking under bridges,</p>
<p>while other officers went knocking on doors.</p>
<p>The early canvas efforts were tricky</p>
<p>because, as I said, the Hulses didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>any super close neighbors,</p>
<p>so state and county law enforcement</p>
<p>had to widen their radius</p>
<p>to within a few miles of the Hulse home,</p>
<p>and they worked to talk to anyone within that bubble.</p>
<p>Most people hadn&rsquo;t seen</p>
<p>or heard anything unusual that morning.</p>
<p>A few people mentioned a book salesman</p>
<p>who had been frequenting the area.</p>
<p>Sometimes they added a detail about a green car,</p>
<p>but that was the only stranger</p>
<p>they encountered in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Police also asked Ron to come to the house</p>
<p>to look around and see if anything of value was missing.</p>
<p>They wanted to know what exactly they were dealing with</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a difference between a robbery gone wrong</p>
<p>and a crazed abductor on the loose snatching housewives.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it was awful for Ron to see his home</p>
<p>with blood all over the carpet.</p>
<p>But he said that the only thing missing</p>
<p>was the fireplace poker,</p>
<p>and of course, his wife.</p>
<p>Everything else was still there,</p>
<p>even the cash that had been left</p>
<p>sitting out on the piano.</p>
<p>While he was there,</p>
<p>Ron was able to grab some overnight clothes</p>
<p>for his daughter,</p>
<p>since they&rsquo;d all probably have to stay</p>
<p>with his parents for a while.</p>
<p>And speaking of his parents,</p>
<p>back at their house,</p>
<p>police interviewed his dad, Harvey Hulse,</p>
<p>who said that this whole thing</p>
<p>was even more shocking to him</p>
<p>because he had just seen Darlene and the girls</p>
<p>that very morning at like 8.45</p>
<p>when he biked over to drop off</p>
<p>some mushy bananas for baby Kristen.</p>
<p>This actually helped police with their timeline</p>
<p>because that meant that the man showed up</p>
<p>and likely attacked Darlene</p>
<p>sometime between 9 when Harvey left</p>
<p>and 9.30 when the girls showed up</p>
<p>at their grandparents&rsquo; house.</p>
<p>Harvey said that he hadn&rsquo;t noticed anything unusual</p>
<p>and that things seemed totally normal</p>
<p>when he was there.</p>
<p>He said he biked home,</p>
<p>got in his car,</p>
<p>and went to work after that.</p>
<p>Evening was rolling in</p>
<p>and the searches for Darlene</p>
<p>hadn&rsquo;t turned up anything.</p>
<p>Not her, not the suspect.</p>
<p>But at around 6,</p>
<p>Indiana State Police announced</p>
<p>that they had stopped a blonde man</p>
<p>driving a green Pontiac Grand Prix.</p>
<p>Officers went and actually got</p>
<p>Ron, Marie, and Melissa</p>
<p>and immediately took them</p>
<p>to the ISP post in Peru, Indiana</p>
<p>to get a look at this guy and his car.</p>
<p>But the girls said,</p>
<p>nope, that wasn&rsquo;t the green clunker</p>
<p>they saw outside their house</p>
<p>and the guy wasn&rsquo;t the one that they saw</p>
<p>knelt over their mother, growling.</p>
<p>Police knew their best bet</p>
<p>would be to put out a picture of the suspect</p>
<p>rather than bringing every blonde-haired man</p>
<p>driving a green car down to their station.</p>
<p>So that same night,</p>
<p>they took Marie and Melissa</p>
<p>to the South Bend Police Department</p>
<p>to make an artist&rsquo;s sketch of the suspect.</p>
<p>It was all day long.</p>
<p>Someone else would pull me aside and say,</p>
<p>okay, Marie, let&rsquo;s go over this again.</p>
<p>Okay, look at this.</p>
<p>And I cannot tell you how many times</p>
<p>we had to go into the police station</p>
<p>and look at picture books.</p>
<p>They were lined up</p>
<p>in like those plastic folder things</p>
<p>and we would just flip, flip.</p>
<p>And then dad&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re going to go do something fun.</p>
<p>And I was like, what?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re going to go</p>
<p>to a person who sketches people, an artist.</p>
<p>And I was like, that&rsquo;s not fun.</p>
<p>It was a woman who drew like amazing stuff</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like, okay,</p>
<p>so when you look at these eyes,</p>
<p>what were the shape of his eyes?</p>
<p>And I remember like lines of eyes,</p>
<p>lines of noses, lines of mouths.</p>
<p>I remember his eyes,</p>
<p>but beyond that and the color of his hair</p>
<p>and stuff, I couldn&rsquo;t really.</p>
<p>And then when she got done,</p>
<p>the picture did look similar.</p>
<p>So I was like, oh, that was neat</p>
<p>that you were able to do that.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it was constant.</p>
<p>It was all the time.</p>
<p>And they would bribe me with Cokes,</p>
<p>which I never drank Cokes.</p>
<p>And so I remember, I don&rsquo;t want any more Cokes.</p>
<p>But you just remember weird stuff like that.</p>
<p>And I was freezing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so cold in all of those places.</p>
<p>That was my memory of it.</p>
<p>We have that original sketch</p>
<p>and you can see it on our website,</p>
<p>thedeckpodcast.com.</p>
<p>What they really focused in on for the sketch</p>
<p>were the light eyes.</p>
<p>Also the fact that Marie and Melissa</p>
<p>both remembered him having a distinct thin</p>
<p>and long nose, a narrow face</p>
<p>and light combed over hair.</p>
<p>Which the girls described as streaky.</p>
<p>And the way it got reported back in the day</p>
<p>was that he had black streaks in his hair.</p>
<p>This is something that I also became obsessed over</p>
<p>because it seemed so distinct.</p>
<p>But when we talked to them today,</p>
<p>they said, no, it was more like it was two-toned.</p>
<p>Like someone who&rsquo;d been out in the sun</p>
<p>and it looked highlighted.</p>
<p>The other thing that they were both adamant about</p>
<p>is that he was clean shaven</p>
<p>with no facial hair whatsoever.</p>
<p>By the time Ron and the girls</p>
<p>got back to his parents&rsquo; house,</p>
<p>it was dark out.</p>
<p>And the searches for Darlene</p>
<p>were wrapping up for the night.</p>
<p>All the law enforcement agencies</p>
<p>from state, county and local</p>
<p>met at the Argus Police Department</p>
<p>to make a plan for the next morning.</p>
<p>Even two FBI agents from the South Bend field office</p>
<p>came down to help with the kidnapping aspect</p>
<p>of the investigation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine what that first night</p>
<p>was like for Darlene&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>Ron must have felt totally helpless</p>
<p>and just distraught</p>
<p>from the thought of his wife being either</p>
<p>held hostage by some crazy guy</p>
<p>or alone and injured somewhere</p>
<p>or even worse.</p>
<p>And thoughts about the scary man</p>
<p>kept running through Marie and Melissa&rsquo;s minds.</p>
<p>They had just witnessed</p>
<p>such a horrific, life-altering tragedy</p>
<p>in the safety of their own home,</p>
<p>watching a stranger hurt their loving mom</p>
<p>and protect her.</p>
<p>Their sense of safety had been shattered.</p>
<p>And as they tried to go to bed that night,</p>
<p>praying that their mother would be there</p>
<p>when they woke up,</p>
<p>one terrifying thought kept them awake.</p>
<p>What if the man came back for them?</p>
<p>Well, dad did the best he could</p>
<p>to make it okay.</p>
<p>He just kept saying things like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have new carpet,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to love it,</p>
<p>I picked out new carpet.</p>
<p>And he would assure us that,</p>
<p>just like lightning&rsquo;s not going to strike</p>
<p>the same place twice,</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s like, now,</p>
<p>this is not ever going to happen to you again.</p>
<p>This will never happen to you again.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to worry about that anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>this doesn&rsquo;t usually happen to anybody.</p>
<p>The chances of it happening again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to, you know?</p>
<p>And so we just kind of held on to that,</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s not going to come back.</p>
<p>That would be stupid.</p>
<p>Ron was right.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t come back.</p>
<p>But neither would their mother.</p>
<p>As they laid, tucked into bed that night,</p>
<p>unbeknownst to them,</p>
<p>Darlene was lying just six miles away.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s next on episode three,</p>
<p>The Wooded Path.</p>
<p>You can listen to that right now.</p>
