    <p>Hi friends so this week I want to talk about jealousy and not just jealousy in</p>
<p>relationships, jealousy in friendships too because I used to be and still am</p>
<p>one of the most jealous motherfuckers you can find. So first I want to</p>
<p>deconstruct everybody&rsquo;s view of jealousy because everybody just writes it off</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s bad and it&rsquo;s like toxic if you&rsquo;re jealous. We&rsquo;re gonna go into that</p>
<p>shit I&rsquo;m gonna deconstruct it and then I&rsquo;m gonna give you my tips for dealing</p>
<p>with jealousy and like I said with friendships and relationships because</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m in a relationship I don&rsquo;t want you looking at nobody but me, talking to</p>
<p>nobody but me, thinking of nobody but me, and if I&rsquo;m friends with you I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>you having no other friends but me. And when I say we got to go into it we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go into it because I understand this is not like a healthy way to be but</p>
<p>it does not negate the way that I feel. Like I&rsquo;m fully aware of the proper way</p>
<p>and the healthy way of having a relationship or having a friendship but</p>
<p>motherfucker my feelings say otherwise. So I&rsquo;m gonna break all this down and</p>
<p>teach you how I truly deal with it because this is the shit that I could</p>
<p>not find online when I was looking for it and this is what&rsquo;s helped me the most.</p>
<p>So here we go. So the biggest thing I realized about jealousy is you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>just jealous for no reason. It doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re crazy and it doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re immature and it doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re toxic. The way that you respond to</p>
<p>when you feel jealous makes you toxic or not but we&rsquo;re gonna get into that. But</p>
<p>the biggest thing to realize about jealousy is you&rsquo;re not fucking crazy for</p>
<p>it. It&rsquo;s not just this feeling that comes out of nowhere. What&rsquo;s really going on</p>
<p>when you feel jealous is you&rsquo;ve perceived a threat to your connection</p>
<p>with someone or your closeness to someone and that alone will give you a</p>
<p>lot of explanation to why you feel the way that you do. Because it does not feel</p>
<p>good to feel jealous but it&rsquo;s not just jealousy. You&rsquo;re perceiving a threat to</p>
<p>your connection with someone. You&rsquo;re perceiving a threat to your closeness.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re perceiving a threat to your security and your attachment with</p>
<p>someone. So of course you&rsquo;re gonna have a fucking emotional reaction to that.</p>
<p>Anyone would and anyone who says they don&rsquo;t is a fucking liar. They might not</p>
<p>label it as jealousy but everybody gets that anxious and that like anger</p>
<p>aggressive, the scared, the fear. It&rsquo;s like your fight-or-flight mode kicks on when</p>
<p>something could potentially fuck up what you have going on with someone. Whether</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a friendship or a relationship, people that claim not to be jealous, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t believe them. I don&rsquo;t believe them for two fucking seconds because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>just feeling jealous. It&rsquo;s not like that&rsquo;s mine. It&rsquo;s not a sense of</p>
<p>territorial and like you can&rsquo;t touch it. Oh I just don&rsquo;t get jealous. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>people that say they don&rsquo;t get jealous feel very secure in their attachment</p>
<p>with someone and they don&rsquo;t feel like there&rsquo;s a threat. But if they felt like</p>
<p>there was a threat, they would feel jealous. Does that make sense? So the</p>
<p>people that are the most like not jealous are the ones that feel the most</p>
<p>secure in their attachment with someone. That&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m still learning to</p>
<p>navigate. And typically people with abandonment issues or insecurities are</p>
<p>the ones who are gonna feel like there are constant attacks and threats to</p>
<p>their sense of connection. Because the more I&rsquo;ve gotten confident in myself and</p>
<p>the more that I&rsquo;ve built my self-esteem, the less jealous I feel because I</p>
<p>understand my attachment to people and I get it deeper. But for so long like when</p>
<p>I was insecure and I couldn&rsquo;t like fathom like why people would like me,</p>
<p>that shit, oh I was jealous like a motherfucker. Like if you looked at</p>
<p>someone I was with, I was probably in your face in like two seconds. Like I</p>
<p>used to be very very like aggressive and mean and like territorial. I always would</p>
<p>call it territorial but it was just me trying to protect my sense of connection</p>
<p>with someone. It&rsquo;s like I was aggressive over it because I was so fucking worried</p>
<p>about it. And that&rsquo;s where I talk about the way you react makes you toxic or not.</p>
<p>Because when I used to react aggressively like that would make me</p>
<p>seem toxic and it was a toxic cycle about like people I like and care about</p>
<p>talking to other people and being around other people. Like I&rsquo;m still very</p>
<p>sensitive to disrespect. If something is disrespectful, I&rsquo;m fucking reacting off</p>
<p>of that. But when you feel a sense of jealousy, you feel a threat to your</p>
<p>connection with someone, I&rsquo;m gonna keep saying those things together because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s truly fucking going on. If you all of a sudden start lashing out</p>
<p>over the way that you&rsquo;re feeling, you&rsquo;re gonna seem like an asshole, you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>seem toxic, and you&rsquo;re gonna seem irrational. But bringing up the irrational</p>
<p>part, I have to go into that too. Things are gonna seem so irrational to other</p>
<p>people. Like other people are not gonna understand why you feel the way that you</p>
<p>do. Like if you&rsquo;re the type that&rsquo;s like overly jealous and you&rsquo;re very insecure</p>
<p>in your attachment with people, you can understand why you feel the way that you</p>
<p>do. But to other people, they&rsquo;re not gonna be able to grasp why you&rsquo;re having such</p>
<p>a strong emotional reaction to a little situation. So other people are not really</p>
<p>gonna get it. But that&rsquo;s why I say don&rsquo;t just let someone write you off as</p>
<p>jealous. Like say what the fuck it is. I feel insecure in my attachment with you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna make it seem a lot more human and understandable to other people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just gonna be like, oh you&rsquo;re just being irrational, you&rsquo;re crazy, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>psycho. No motherfucker, I&rsquo;m hurt, I&rsquo;m scared. You go at someone with two</p>
<p>different energies. When you go at someone and just like, oh you&rsquo;re jealous,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re toxic, versus I&rsquo;m unstable in my connection with you, I&rsquo;m fearful of</p>
<p>losing you, or I&rsquo;m fearful of someone taking you away. That&rsquo;s two different</p>
<p>reactions you&rsquo;re gonna get based off how you communicate the way that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>feeling. But my big point was saying other people are gonna think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>irrational. If you feel unstable in a connection and they don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna understand why you feel the way that you do and feel so strongly. Like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a disconnect. Like they feel secure, you don&rsquo;t. So when you have a</p>
<p>reaction, when you perceive a threat to the connection, they&rsquo;re not gonna</p>
<p>understand why you feel so strongly because they don&rsquo;t feel it. But anyone in</p>
<p>your fucking shoes that feels unstable in their connection with someone, if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a perceived threat to it, they will feel the exact way that you do too.</p>
<p>People need to get a fucking better understanding of this shit. That&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making this podcast episode. But I still deal with these feelings. I still</p>
<p>deal with feeling jealous all the time. But I no longer call it being jealous.</p>
<p>Like I said, I re-fucking worded it into like, okay, I feel unstable in my</p>
<p>connection with someone. I&rsquo;ve just learned to respond differently. So used</p>
<p>to I would just like lash out at the situation. But now I&rsquo;m able to look at</p>
<p>was there a situation that happened that was disrespectful? Or is my emotional</p>
<p>reaction like irrational in this situation? Like look at it logically.</p>
<p>Because you can feel things and they seem normal. But if you look at the</p>
<p>situation logically, did this thing cause this big of a reaction in me? Does it</p>
<p>make sense that I&rsquo;m this emotional over this one little thing? Like my friend</p>
<p>talking to somebody else and getting along with someone else. Does it make</p>
<p>logical sense for me to feel like anger, rage, like shake and like be so upset</p>
<p>about it? Does it make sense? No. It makes no logical sense. So the way that I have</p>
<p>to go about comforting myself is, like I said, when you feel jealous, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>insecure in your attachment with someone. So you have to do things and comfort</p>
<p>yourself in a way where you show yourself and feel more connected and</p>
<p>secure in being like attached to a person. And the main way you have to do</p>
<p>that is look at how the person is attached to you. All you see when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>insecure is how you&rsquo;re attached to other people. You don&rsquo;t see how they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>attached to you too. And that&rsquo;ll lead you to a lot of like isolation and</p>
<p>insecurity and feeling all this fucking shit. But I&rsquo;m gonna open you up to that</p>
<p>world because that&rsquo;s one I didn&rsquo;t see for a long time was look at how someone</p>
<p>could be attached to you and could want you and how their life would be impacted</p>
<p>by losing you. Look at how they&rsquo;re fucking attached to you too because you</p>
<p>see how you&rsquo;re attached to them and it feels so scary and you&rsquo;re so anxious</p>
<p>about it because you&rsquo;re not seeing the flip side. You see how attached you are</p>
<p>to them. You&rsquo;re not seeing how attached they are to you. And I promise you they</p>
<p>are. And another big fear I used to have is like I was scared people wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>value me enough to prioritize keeping their connection with me. Like if</p>
<p>something better came along they would just like go for that and discard me. So</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying. You have to reassure yourself first and see all of</p>
<p>this first. Like they don&rsquo;t have to be included on this part. Now if you do</p>
<p>everything I say in this episode and you don&rsquo;t feel more secure in your</p>
<p>attachment with someone, go to them and talk through it with them and they&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>able to reassure you and make you feel better. You need to learn to reassure</p>
<p>yourself first. If you go to someone every time you feel fucking insecure,</p>
<p>jealous, whatever it is, they&rsquo;re gonna get fed the fuck up and they&rsquo;re gonna get</p>
<p>tired of it. So the biggest thing is learning to comfort yourself because I</p>
<p>used to not be able to do that. I didn&rsquo;t know how to do it. So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>here to share. So the ways that I comfort myself, the first thing I look at with</p>
<p>the person is like I understand, okay if this situation was not one of disrespect,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just thinking irrationally and I&rsquo;m just feeling like incongruent to what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening. The first thing I do to make myself feel closer and more secure in my</p>
<p>attachment with someone is to ask myself what needs do I meet for them? Because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll make me see how I&rsquo;m hard to just dispose of. The next question I ask</p>
<p>myself is what would their life look like without me in it? Like this is</p>
<p>really just a practice of seeing your own value and recognizing how other</p>
<p>people appreciate you and why they would want you in their life. Like you have to</p>
<p>see that first. So I also ask like how am I valuable to them? Like what about me</p>
<p>makes me valuable to them? And another way that I do this if I can&rsquo;t think of</p>
<p>anything, I will ask myself like if I had someone like me in my life, why would</p>
<p>I be scared to lose them? If I was friends with me or I was dating someone</p>
<p>just like me, what would be so scary about losing that person? Because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna reflect you all the value you have and it&rsquo;s gonna reflect you how much they</p>
<p>appreciate you. Which will make you feel more secure in your relationship or</p>
<p>attachment with them. Another thing I really like to do is ask people around</p>
<p>me. So like I&rsquo;m very close with my sister and she will give me the honest fucking</p>
<p>truth. Like good and bad. So I always go to her for shit like this because she&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>reflect me the truth. I&rsquo;ll ask her about like my connection with people and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very good at reassuring me that they&rsquo;d be stupid not to fucking wanna like</p>
<p>be friends with me basically or love me. But talk to other people around you</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll be able to voice things about you that they&rsquo;re attached to that</p>
<p>you might not be thinking of that you can apply to your situation. It will make</p>
<p>you feel more attached to the people you talk to. One, because you see how they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>attached to you. And two, it will help you see shit you weren&rsquo;t seeing about the</p>
<p>person you&rsquo;re worried about. So talking to other people around you that you</p>
<p>trust and care about and will be honest with you is fucking huge and I love that.</p>
<p>So the last thing I kind of ask myself and do if a situation makes me feel</p>
<p>really jealous. So I&rsquo;ll look at did the person do anything? Like I analyzed if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s disrespectful or not. If they&rsquo;re not being disrespectful, okay what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>situation? What&rsquo;s gone on? Did they do anything? And then I&rsquo;ll look at have they</p>
<p>pulled back from me or like distanced their self in any way? Like even before</p>
<p>that? Like have they been acting different? Like try and spot changes in</p>
<p>behavior and see if something&rsquo;s going on with them. And could anything else be</p>
<p>going on in their life? Are they dealing with certain shit that caused them to</p>
<p>act different toward you? Like certain people when they&rsquo;re too mentally</p>
<p>preoccupied with something or they&rsquo;re dealing with a hard time, they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna be able to be as attentive to you. So you have to cut people slack. So my</p>
<p>point with bringing this up is to basically see if there&rsquo;s anything else</p>
<p>going on with their behavior towards you. Because that might be a signal</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s going on with them. They might be dealing with something. They</p>
<p>might be going through something. They might be feeling something. And you might</p>
<p>need to check in on them. Don&rsquo;t make their change in behavior mean anything</p>
<p>about you. Like you&rsquo;re gonna have that hit of like feeling anxious that like</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s wrong. But something might just be going on with them. They just</p>
<p>might be dealing with something. So if you can look at their behavior and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not been like different in a bad way toward you. Like they&rsquo;re not pulling away</p>
<p>from you personally. They might just be dealing with some shit. Check in on them.</p>
<p>Ask what&rsquo;s going on. Just be like, hey I&rsquo;ve been feeling like something&rsquo;s up. I</p>
<p>wanted to check in on you. People love to be checked in on. I fucking love when my</p>
<p>friends check on me. Like thank you so much. Thank you for being concerned. But</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really big thing that I like to do is you have to analyze like are you</p>
<p>the problem? Are you not? If you&rsquo;re not, check in on them because it might just</p>
<p>be a signal that something&rsquo;s going on with them. And they might need comfort.</p>
<p>They might need support. And that being there for them, recognizing when they</p>
<p>need comfort, and then giving it to them will make them feel more attached to you.</p>
<p>Trust me. Okay so now I&rsquo;m gonna give you a personal story or situation about when</p>
<p>my emotional reactions are very irrational and they don&rsquo;t make fucking</p>
<p>sense. So if a situation happens and what happened does not match the amount that</p>
<p>you feel. Like if it seems like a small situation and your emotional reaction is</p>
<p>like way fucking overboard, nothing is ever an overreaction. There&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>deeper going on. And I&rsquo;m gonna say that again. Nothing is ever an overreaction if</p>
<p>someone is upset. They are reacting accordingly to what they&rsquo;re feeling. Now</p>
<p>a certain situation might have just triggered something they are not aware</p>
<p>of. So it might just be like a little messenger of like an unhealed aspect or</p>
<p>unhealed emotions and shit you haven&rsquo;t processed yet. And I&rsquo;m gonna give you my</p>
<p>fucking example of this. Oh God. My biggest heartbreaks and like the only</p>
<p>real time I&rsquo;ve truly felt heartbroken is from family members and friends. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where the deepest shit hits. Like sure like you have a little heartbreak when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going through a relationship, but my deepest heartbreaks have been from my</p>
<p>family. And that&rsquo;s a fucking topic for another day. But this situation I have to</p>
<p>give you kind of like a rundown and you&rsquo;re gonna get to know something about</p>
<p>me that I&rsquo;m hesitant to share but I fucking need to. It proves the point.</p>
<p>Okay so when I was younger my mom was dating a guy named Josh and he is such a</p>
<p>key element to who I am and why I am the way that I am. Now I will do a full</p>
<p>podcast episode about my experience with him because he literally fucked me up.</p>
<p>Like extreme levels of like physical abuse, torture, psychological abuse, shit</p>
<p>like that. That literally shaped me into who I am. A big part of it. But Josh got</p>
<p>me into lifting. Like weightlifting. So when I was like 14 I started P90X and I</p>
<p>started like doing my little fitness shit. I don&rsquo;t know what the fuck I was</p>
<p>doing. I started like getting into shape like trying to because I was like chubby</p>
<p>and I was just doing like a little P90X shit at home because I was too</p>
<p>embarrassed to go to a gym. But when my mom started dating Josh, me and my mom</p>
<p>started talking again. And then Josh kind of like took me under his wing and like</p>
<p>forced me to go to the gym with him. He&rsquo;s like come on fucker you&rsquo;re done with</p>
<p>your little P90X shit. Like you&rsquo;re coming to the gym with me. So he got me</p>
<p>into the gym and he&rsquo;s the whole reason that like I got into lifting and like he</p>
<p>taught me everything I know. And he&rsquo;s such a key element. But we would work out</p>
<p>every day together. Every fucking day. It&rsquo;s like he took me under his little</p>
<p>wing and I was like his little gym buddy. And he was like a big brother to me. Like</p>
<p>a big brother I never had. And like a father figure but not really. It was like</p>
<p>a big brother. And I&rsquo;ve never had many like close guy friends when I was</p>
<p>younger. I do now. But I never really had close guy friends growing up. But Josh</p>
<p>was like my best friend. He was like a big brother. I finally had like a male</p>
<p>figure I could look up to. And like someone to guide me and teach me things.</p>
<p>So we were working out every day together. And we had been working out</p>
<p>together every day for like a year at this point. And we were literally like it</p>
<p>was part of our fucking routine. It was what we did. Like we were so tight.</p>
<p>We were best fucking friends. And even with everything going on. Like with the</p>
<p>abusive shit. Like we were still so tight. It was the weirdest fucking shit. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand it. Like he&rsquo;s dead now. And he died like tragically. But he did so much</p>
<p>fucked up shit to me. But I still care about him so much. Weird dynamic. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not the fucking point. Leo get on track. So the whole thing is we worked out</p>
<p>every day together for a year. I felt so close to him. We would do everything</p>
<p>together. I felt like best fucking buddies. And then one day he came home</p>
<p>from work. And I was getting ready to go to the gym at the time that we usually</p>
<p>go. And he goes oh Leo like we&rsquo;re not working out together today. I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>train with somebody else. So he wasn&rsquo;t working out with me. And I literally like</p>
<p>inside freaked the fuck out. Like that jealousy feeling came out like I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never fucking felt it before. Like I literally like had to like walk away and</p>
<p>go to my room. And I was like like my chest felt so heavy. I was like pissed. I</p>
<p>was like shaking. And I was on the verge of fucking tears. Like I wanted to just</p>
<p>fucking cry. But that was back before I could cry. Like I didn&rsquo;t know how to cry</p>
<p>back then. But like I just felt so angry and like so fucking upset. I felt</p>
<p>betrayed. I felt heartbroken. I was like what the fuck. Like I had a full on</p>
<p>physical and emotional reaction that did not match the situation. He was going to</p>
<p>work out with someone new. That&rsquo;s it. Like why am I acting like there&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>to it. He was going to work out with someone new for a day. But I freaked the</p>
<p>fuck out over it. Like I was so heartbroken. I felt like I lost him. And I</p>
<p>was so like freaked out. And once I became aware that my emotional reaction</p>
<p>I was having was not like congruent with the situation at hand. I was like what</p>
<p>the fuck is really going on here. Because the way that I feel so abandoned</p>
<p>and left and discarded and like hurt. Like I was like no. Why the fuck do I</p>
<p>feel like that. That doesn&rsquo;t make sense. It does not make sense for the situation.</p>
<p>I get you&rsquo;d be upset sure. But like the emotional reaction I had did not make</p>
<p>fucking logical sense. And that&rsquo;s when I say when you have an emotional and</p>
<p>physical reaction that does not match a situation something is going on deeper.</p>
<p>So I asked myself. I&rsquo;m literally getting chills talking about this shit. I asked</p>
<p>myself when I was like feeling upset like that. When was the last time I</p>
<p>experienced this feeling. Because feeling states that you don&rsquo;t process will</p>
<p>revisit you. And revisit you. And revisit you. And they&rsquo;ll be triggered by new</p>
<p>situations until you fucking deal with them. So I asked myself when was the last</p>
<p>time I felt like this. And I immediately got like a flash or like an image of</p>
<p>like when my aunt abandoned me. And let me give you a little background on that.</p>
<p>So my relationship with my parents was always like rocky back and forth. I would</p>
<p>like flip between houses all the time. But my aunt is someone who attached</p>
<p>herself to me very young. She was like my favorite. Everybody knew I&rsquo;d throw</p>
<p>anybody under the fucking bus for her. Like I would literally kill any of them</p>
<p>for her. Like I was so attached to her. I cared about her so fucking much. And</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s been my biggest heartbreak to date of like what happened. But she never had</p>
<p>kids. And she always wanted kids. And the people she was with like couldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>kids. Whatever the fuck. So like she attached herself to me. And like I would</p>
<p>spend every weekend with her. We were as fucking tight as you can be. Like I loved</p>
<p>her so fucking much. And I would see her every like every day basically. And she</p>
<p>lived like a mile away from my dad&rsquo;s house when I lived with him. And like and</p>
<p>it was summer. So like I would walk over to her house here and there because I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have a car. I couldn&rsquo;t drive. So I would just walk to her house. And randomly</p>
<p>one day I got the feeling of like I should go walk over to her house. So I</p>
<p>walk over to her house out of fucking nowhere. I didn&rsquo;t tell her I was coming.</p>
<p>And I walk in the door and all of her shit is packed. And she looks like caught.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like oh shit. Like I wanted I didn&rsquo;t I didn&rsquo;t want you to find out</p>
<p>this way. I wanted to talk to you like first. It was just a normal fucking day</p>
<p>to me. I had no idea what was going on. So she had recently started dating a new</p>
<p>guy. And that day when I walked in the door I found out the next day they were</p>
<p>planning on up and moving and leaving and going to Pennsylvania. And I lived in</p>
<p>Florida. So walking in on that absolutely broke my fucking heart. Like you met a</p>
<p>new person and now I just lost you. Like the person I felt the absolute closest</p>
<p>to. And the way that it went with like if I didn&rsquo;t walk over to that house that</p>
<p>day I wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten to say bye to her. I wouldn&rsquo;t have known what was going</p>
<p>on. She was just gonna fucking leave. So when I was upset about Josh and the gym</p>
<p>situation and I asked when was the last time I felt this emotional reaction. It</p>
<p>was then. It was when I was abandoned. And that is when I had that reaction. Like I</p>
<p>felt like that all over again. When Josh said he was gonna work out with someone</p>
<p>else. So the situation at hand with Josh was not that I was that upset over him</p>
<p>going to the gym with someone else for a day. We were gonna go back together the</p>
<p>fucking next day. It was a trigger from an emotional reaction that I&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>processed. Like I never truly processed the situation with my aunt leaving. Like</p>
<p>it literally broke my fucking heart. But I didn&rsquo;t know how to process my emotions</p>
<p>back then. I don&rsquo;t know how to deal with it. So I just kind of like shut it out.</p>
<p>And it got reflected again. And then I had the chance to process it once I knew</p>
<p>what was going on with the whole Josh situation. So like I said if you have an</p>
<p>emotional fucking reaction that does not fit the situation. Something deeper is</p>
<p>going on. There&rsquo;s something else being triggered. It&rsquo;s not about the gym</p>
<p>situation. It was about when my aunt fucking abandoned me and I never</p>
<p>processed it. I had to go back and reprocess it. And it was the hardest</p>
<p>fucking shit. And I had to literally relive the experience. And like get</p>
<p>myself through it. But since then I&rsquo;ve not had a physical fucking reaction like</p>
<p>that when I get jealous over something. And that&rsquo;s when I started having like</p>
<p>awareness around what jealousy really is. And the whole situation with Josh like</p>
<p>working out with someone new. It was like the exact replica of like this</p>
<p>person I&rsquo;m very close to. They meet someone new and abandoned me. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>that situation was getting replayed in my mind. And that&rsquo;s what got triggered.</p>
<p>Like Josh met this new guy. He was gonna work out with him. And I was immediately</p>
<p>like abandonment comes after. Like my brain just like saw a situation</p>
<p>experienced something before. And then overlaid it over here expecting the same</p>
<p>result. That&rsquo;s why I got so fucked up over it. So just remember me saying you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not fucked up for being jealous. You&rsquo;re not irrational. You&rsquo;re not toxic. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not immature. You&rsquo;re perceiving a threat to your connection with someone. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what jealousy is. Before we jump into what would Leo do I just want to say if</p>
<p>you found this episode useful leave this video a thumbs up. If you&rsquo;re listening to</p>
<p>the audio version leave me a five stars. But send this episode to someone that</p>
<p>you think would benefit. And if you&rsquo;re the person that&rsquo;s dealing with someone</p>
<p>toxic that&rsquo;s like jealous all the time. Now you have a better understanding of</p>
<p>like why they feel the way that they do. They need comfort when they get jealous.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need you to attack them and tell them they&rsquo;re stupid and wrong for it.</p>
<p>And if you are someone that&rsquo;s jealous and you deal with emotional shit like</p>
<p>this all the time or you have a situation where you just want to like</p>
<p>run it by someone. That&rsquo;s why I made my Facebook community. It&rsquo;s a private group</p>
<p>for all of us. Like everyone that thinks like us and listen to this podcast. Like</p>
<p>go in there and submit your situation. Like go type a fucking post and everyone</p>
<p>in the group will like give you advice. So if you think you&rsquo;re being irrational</p>
<p>go ask for opinions from people who fucking get it. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>here. We&rsquo;re all there for each other. That&rsquo;s what the fucking group is for. So</p>
<p>if you want to join that my link to my private Facebook group will be in the</p>
<p>description. So now let&rsquo;s jump into what would Leo do. That&rsquo;s where you guys write</p>
<p>in situations you want my hot take on and my advice on. You want to see what I</p>
<p>would do in your situation or how I would handle it. So our first situation</p>
<p>is basically this girl is dating a guy and the guy bought another girl&rsquo;s Only</p>
<p>Fans and she&rsquo;s like should I be upset over it. But the plot thickens bitch</p>
<p>because the boyfriend bought a girl&rsquo;s Only Fans that he used to work with and</p>
<p>used to like be friends with. That to me is a motherfucking problem. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>basically giving money to a bitch that you want to fuck. Why are you trying to</p>
<p>pay to go look at someone naked? Only Fans is a very sticky situation and a</p>
<p>very sticky topic for me because if I&rsquo;m dating somebody and you&rsquo;re buying</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s Only Fans I&rsquo;m not cool with it. One. But if you buy someone&rsquo;s Only Fans</p>
<p>that you know that&rsquo;s like half fucking cheating. It&rsquo;s not cheating but like my</p>
<p>brain takes it the same way. Like I look at that as disrespectful as fuck and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s weird to me and I would not be okay with it. So do not feel bad and do</p>
<p>not second-guess if you shouldn&rsquo;t be okay with it. Some people would be okay</p>
<p>with it. I&rsquo;m not one of them and if you&rsquo;re not comfortable with it you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not fucking wrong for it because that&rsquo;s very weird. That&rsquo;s very strange. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>getting nudes from someone when you&rsquo;re in a relationship. You&rsquo;re just paying for</p>
<p>them. What the fuck is that? That&rsquo;s so disrespectful to the person you&rsquo;re with.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t force yourself to try and be cool with that shit if you&rsquo;re not. Don&rsquo;t let</p>
<p>him try and talk you out of how you&rsquo;re feeling. If you don&rsquo;t like it you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fucking like it and you don&rsquo;t have to like it. So oh my god that shit pisses me</p>
<p>off. So I have your back. Don&rsquo;t second-guess that and don&rsquo;t let him try</p>
<p>and make you out like you&rsquo;re crazy or you&rsquo;re toxic. Okay so be it then. So be it.</p>
<p>Okay so situation number two for what would Leo do is this girl&rsquo;s boyfriend is</p>
<p>liking a lot of girls pictures on Instagram and a lot of people deal with</p>
<p>this shit when their partner is like following a bunch of girls and like</p>
<p>liking a bunch of their pictures and it pisses them off. So what I would do in</p>
<p>this situation is kind of fucking manipulative but not really. Like I would</p>
<p>try to understand why he does it. Like I would go to him and ask like not with</p>
<p>like a pissy like attitude of like why the fuck do you keep doing this shit. I</p>
<p>would just try to understand what he gets out of it. Like what do you get out</p>
<p>of following all these girls and liking their pictures. I would also voice it if</p>
<p>it bothers you. Like once you understand why he does it you&rsquo;ll have a better</p>
<p>understanding of it sure. But if it still bothers you after that I would say that.</p>
<p>But I really don&rsquo;t understand that whole like incessant need that men have to</p>
<p>like like people&rsquo;s shit. I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t get it. I cannot relate to that. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fucking understand. But if he doesn&rsquo;t stop here&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m gonna hit you with</p>
<p>what would Leo fucking do. If you say that you don&rsquo;t like him following a</p>
<p>bunch of girls and liking all their pictures and he doesn&rsquo;t stop and he just</p>
<p>keeps doing it. Okay stop saying you don&rsquo;t like it. Stop complaining and then</p>
<p>start doing the same shit to him. Go follow guys. Go like guys pictures. See</p>
<p>how he fucking likes it. It takes certain people experiencing a perspective to</p>
<p>understand it. So he&rsquo;s not gonna understand why you feel the way that you</p>
<p>do until he&rsquo;s in it. So if the motherfucker won&rsquo;t cut it out then you</p>
<p>fucking do it right back. But if you don&rsquo;t want to play that petty fucking</p>
<p>game make it a big enough deal where like he understands that you feel it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>disrespectful and you don&rsquo;t fucking like it. You can play that route and go the</p>
<p>right route and like explain that it&rsquo;s a big deal or to do the same shit back. I</p>
<p>would personally do the same shit back if you&rsquo;re gonna pretend like you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get it. Actually if I wouldn&rsquo;t be with someone that didn&rsquo;t fucking get it like</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re gonna pretend like you don&rsquo;t get it I&rsquo;m gonna do the same shit</p>
<p>back to you. Because you&rsquo;re gonna learn one way or another. If me explaining it</p>
<p>to you and how I feel is not enough for you to take it into consideration I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do the shit to you. So you have no choice. You see how it feels. Feels like</p>
<p>shit. Okay so our last situation is this girl has a problem with her boyfriend</p>
<p>talking to other girls when they&rsquo;re out. Like she says he&rsquo;s very like outgoing</p>
<p>and friendly and talks to everybody and it&rsquo;s just like a little social fucking</p>
<p>butterfly. But she feels jealous when he talks to other girls at the bar. Like</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s just a conversation she feels jealous. So what I would do is look</p>
<p>at in the situation with him you know how he behaves with other people, normal</p>
<p>people, friends and you know how he behaves with you. So look at the way that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s interacting with this girl at the bar. Is he treating her like he treats</p>
<p>everybody else when he&rsquo;s just friendly? Or is there a certain element of like</p>
<p>being flirty with it? So just check the situation. Like is he being consistent</p>
<p>with how he is with everyone? Or is he acting a specific way to this certain</p>
<p>girl? Because the feeling of jealousy coming up is totally fucking normal. But</p>
<p>a way to reassure yourself is look at if he&rsquo;s acting the same with everybody</p>
<p>else. And if he&rsquo;s not and it seems like it&rsquo;s something specific to the girl</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you can get concerned and bring it to his attention. But if you can</p>
<p>see that the way he&rsquo;s interacting with this girl at the bar or these people or</p>
<p>whoever is the same that he interacts with a lot of other people. You can give</p>
<p>yourself that reassurance that there&rsquo;s not a real threat to worry about. Your</p>
<p>fucking little spidey senses are always gonna be up. You&rsquo;re always gonna be aware.</p>
<p>But if you can see that he&rsquo;s not giving a girl any special treatment just</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s interested. Like he treats all of his friends and everybody he</p>
<p>talks to like that. You&rsquo;ll be able to give yourself that peace of mind and the</p>
<p>reassurance that there&rsquo;s nothing actually deeper going on. But you fully</p>
<p>are allowed to stand up for yourself. If something does get a little too flirty</p>
<p>for you. You can straight up just say I don&rsquo;t like this. And everybody knows</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on. That&rsquo;s a good way to like defuse the situation without making</p>
<p>it like a fight or a big fucking deal. But if the girl walks away you can just</p>
<p>look at him and be like I didn&rsquo;t like that. And it&rsquo;s not causing a fight.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not being difficult. You&rsquo;re not being a fucking cunt. You&rsquo;re not being</p>
<p>rude. You&rsquo;re not out of pocket. Just saying I didn&rsquo;t like that. He knows what</p>
<p>he fucking did. He knows it made you uncomfortable. Like there&rsquo;s a certain way</p>
<p>to gauge this and run this situation. But the first thing is reassure yourself. Is</p>
<p>he acting any different way? Is he flirting? Is he being extra? Or is he</p>
<p>just being friendly like he usually is? And then the way to handle it is like I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like that or I didn&rsquo;t like that. Like when the girl&rsquo;s there I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fucking like that. That&rsquo;s some shit I would say. And then it&rsquo;s like everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>now aware that I&rsquo;m uncomfortable with it so how are they gonna act? Are they</p>
<p>gonna understand that I feel uncomfortable and stop doing it? Because</p>
<p>if you keep fucking doing it then it&rsquo;s disrespectful. You know I&rsquo;m not cool with</p>
<p>it and you keep doing it. Now somebody&rsquo;s getting hit. Hmm maybe not promote that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my situation. I probably won&rsquo;t hit you. Who I am now? I&rsquo;ll just dog cuss you</p>
<p>the fuck out. I&rsquo;m not gonna hit you. Like violence is my last resort. But old me</p>
<p>would have slapped the fuck out of somebody. But that&rsquo;s all I got for what</p>
<p>would Leo do this week. If you want your situation to be part of a future episode</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a link in the description where you can send in your submission of your</p>
<p>situation. Like whatever you&rsquo;re dealing with and whatever you want my advice on</p>
<p>my hot take on. It&rsquo;s completely anonymous so don&rsquo;t stress about that. But like I</p>
<p>said if you enjoyed this video make sure to share it with someone. Like post it to</p>
<p>your story on Instagram. Because like I love when you guys post to your story</p>
<p>because then I get to post it. Also the link to my private Facebook group will</p>
<p>be in the description. Just click the link and join it. And if you want to get</p>
<p>a copy of my accountability worksheets. Like the little worksheets I make myself</p>
<p>to stay productive and consistent and disciplined and motivated and all that.</p>
<p>And how I like break down my tasks and what I need to do. And make it easy. Like</p>
<p>my diet plan and all that. Like how I diet very easily. If you want copies of</p>
<p>any of those worksheets about how I like get myself in check. I&rsquo;ll also link those</p>
<p>in the description. You can download them. And finally if you want to download my</p>
<p>app Positive Focus. It&rsquo;s an app that sends you positive notifications</p>
<p>throughout the day. Like just positive little messages that are gonna like</p>
<p>guide your attention into like a more positive direction. And like flip you out</p>
<p>of whatever negative shit that you&rsquo;re in. So the link for that will also be in the</p>
<p>description. It&rsquo;s available for iPhones and Androids. But that&rsquo;s all I got for</p>
<p>this episode. Please leave it a thumbs up if you liked it. And like I said before</p>
<p>leave me a five-star rating. Please. But thank you guys so much for watching and</p>
<p>I will talk to you next Sunday.</p>
