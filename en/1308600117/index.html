    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are discussing fertility.</p>
<p>We will discuss male fertility and female fertility.</p>
<p>And I should mention that today&rsquo;s discussion</p>
<p>is not just for people who are seeking to conceive children</p>
<p>or who want to know how their children were conceived,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really for everybody.</p>
<p>And I say that because it is the story of all of us.</p>
<p>All of us are here</p>
<p>because a specialized set of cells called germ cells,</p>
<p>that is the sperm and the egg,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll make it very clear</p>
<p>why they&rsquo;re called germ cells a little bit later,</p>
<p>has nothing to do with infection.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s because a sperm cell and an egg cell</p>
<p>arrived at one another,</p>
<p>either in vivo, inside of our mother,</p>
<p>or in vitro, so-called in vitro fertilization,</p>
<p>and then were implanted into our mother and became us.</p>
<p>And so understanding the process</p>
<p>of how the egg cell and the sperm cell came to be</p>
<p>is really the key to understanding</p>
<p>how that fertilization process came to be.</p>
<p>I know everyone&rsquo;s thinking,</p>
<p>I know how fertilization occurs.</p>
<p>It occurs through sexual intercourse and so on.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk a little bit about that,</p>
<p>but I promise you that if you understand</p>
<p>the menstrual cycle and the menstrual cycle</p>
<p>in today&rsquo;s conversation can best be thought of</p>
<p>as a biological cycle that occurs in females</p>
<p>that allows the potential for fertilization by the sperm,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really what it is.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a beautifully orchestrated process</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll describe to you.</p>
<p>And I should say all people, males and females,</p>
<p>should really understand how the menstrual cycle works,</p>
<p>how it impacts fertilization,</p>
<p>but also how it impacts the brain and body,</p>
<p>behavior, psychology, et cetera.</p>
<p>And we will also talk about spermatogenesis,</p>
<p>how sperm cells come to be,</p>
<p>and how they arrive, that is how they swim to the egg,</p>
<p>and the incredible interplay between the biology</p>
<p>of the sperm and the biology of the egg</p>
<p>leads to this incredible thing that we call embryogenesis</p>
<p>and the birth of the child.</p>
<p>And of course, the development of that child</p>
<p>into an infant, a toddler, an adolescent,</p>
<p>a teen, and an adult.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s discussion, again, is not just for those of you</p>
<p>that are seeking to have children.</p>
<p>And I say that because when you look at the data,</p>
<p>you look at the literature on longevity and vitality,</p>
<p>two themes in biology that oftentimes people lump together,</p>
<p>but aren&rsquo;t always the same.</p>
<p>For instance, there are a lot of things that we can do</p>
<p>to increase our vitality that actually can harm</p>
<p>our longevity.</p>
<p>But there are a subset of biological rules and mechanisms</p>
<p>that when aligned, allow us to maximize both our vitality</p>
<p>and our longevity.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that all of those mechanisms</p>
<p>and tools are housed in the discussion around</p>
<p>maximizing fertility.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true whether or not you&rsquo;re male or female.</p>
<p>In other words, if you want children or if you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>if you already have children or if you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>understanding how fertility and fertilization occurs</p>
<p>in the brain and body will allow you to maximize</p>
<p>your vitality and longevity.</p>
<p>And of course, today&rsquo;s discussion will provide</p>
<p>an understanding of the biology and many actionable tools</p>
<p>that will also help you conceive children</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s your wish.</p>
<p>So of course, as is characteristic of this podcast,</p>
<p>we will discuss science-based tools,</p>
<p>including behavioral tools, both the do&rsquo;s and the don&rsquo;ts.</p>
<p>And we will discuss nutrition-based tools</p>
<p>and supplementation-based tools and some other practices,</p>
<p>including things like acupuncture,</p>
<p>which have quite good data to support them</p>
<p>in terms of improving fertility.</p>
<p>And we will discuss why those certain practices can work.</p>
<p>And we will discuss prescription drugs</p>
<p>that your doctor can prescribe to you.</p>
<p>If for instance, you have a deficit</p>
<p>at the level of hormone production</p>
<p>or neurotransmitter production at the level of the brain</p>
<p>or the pituitary gland,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain what all of those things are soon,</p>
<p>or the gonads, the ovary and the testes</p>
<p>in females and males respectively.</p>
<p>Again, by the end of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>you will have a lot of knowledge and actionable tools</p>
<p>related to maximizing fertility.</p>
<p>And you will have a lot of knowledge and actionable tools</p>
<p>related to maximizing vitality and longevity.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Maui Nui Meats.</p>
<p>Maui Nui Meats, I can confidently say,</p>
<p>are the most nutrient-dense and delicious red meat available.</p>
<p>Maui Nui spent nearly a decade</p>
<p>building a USDA certified wild harvesting system</p>
<p>to help balance invasive deer populations</p>
<p>on the Island of Maui.</p>
<p>The solution they built turns the proliferation</p>
<p>of an invasive species into a wide range</p>
<p>of nutrient-dense products,</p>
<p>from fresh butcher cuts and organ meats</p>
<p>to bone broth, jerky, and even pet treats.</p>
<p>Their bone broth has an unmatched 25 grams of protein</p>
<p>per 100 calories.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked before on this podcast</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve had several expert guests come on this podcast</p>
<p>to talk about the fact that most people</p>
<p>should aim to get one gram of quality protein</p>
<p>per pound of body weight per day</p>
<p>in order to maximize their health, tissue repair,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.</p>
<p>Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers</p>
<p>with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the fact that sleep is the fundamental layer</p>
<p>of mental health, physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>Now, one of the key things</p>
<p>for getting a great night&rsquo;s sleep every single night</p>
<p>is to optimize the temperature of your sleeping environment.</p>
<p>Put simply, in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep,</p>
<p>your body temperature needs to drop</p>
<p>by about one to three degrees.</p>
<p>And waking up, on the other hand,</p>
<p>involves a heating of your body</p>
<p>by about one to three degrees.</p>
<p>With Eight Sleep, you can tune the temperature</p>
<p>of your mattress cover or mattress</p>
<p>to be cooler or hotter,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not you tend to run</p>
<p>too hot or too cold.</p>
<p>And you can even vary it across the night</p>
<p>so that you can access the best deep sleep</p>
<p>early in the night,</p>
<p>the so-called REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more pronounced in the later half of the night.</p>
<p>And in doing so, really get your sleep optimized,</p>
<p>not just in terms of duration,</p>
<p>but in terms of quality</p>
<p>and the overall architecture of your sleep.</p>
<p>This has a profound influence</p>
<p>on your alertness, focus, mood,</p>
<p>and many other important factors throughout the day.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us</p>
<p>by Momentous Supplements.</p>
<p>I want to acknowledge that not everybody needs supplements</p>
<p>and yet many, many people derive tremendous benefit</p>
<p>from proper supplementation.</p>
<p>I would count myself in that group.</p>
<p>There are excellent supplements</p>
<p>for improving the depth and quality of sleep,</p>
<p>for improving focus and for improving energy</p>
<p>and for hormone optimization</p>
<p>and many other factors related to our mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve partnered with Momentous Supplements</p>
<p>for three important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, Momentous Supplements</p>
<p>are of the very highest quality.</p>
<p>Second of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>and we know that many of you reside</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>And third, they focus on single ingredient formulations.</p>
<p>This is very important.</p>
<p>There is a place for blends,</p>
<p>but in most cases,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to develop a supplement protocol,</p>
<p>you want it to be single ingredient formulation</p>
<p>so that you can adjust the dosages of different things</p>
<p>according to what works and doesn&rsquo;t work for you,</p>
<p>which is essentially impossible to do</p>
<p>if you are using multi-ingredient formulations.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements that I take</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;ve discussed here on the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about fertility.</p>
<p>And in doing so,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take a step back from this word fertility</p>
<p>and ask what is fertility and fertilization</p>
<p>really all about?</p>
<p>Well, the obvious answer</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s about producing offspring.</p>
<p>But more importantly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about producing offspring</p>
<p>that contain the genetic components of both parents</p>
<p>and indeed contain half of the genes from one parent</p>
<p>and half of the genes from another parent.</p>
<p>Now, there are two general types of cells in the body.</p>
<p>The most common types of cells in the body</p>
<p>are called somatic cells.</p>
<p>So these would be all the cells in your body</p>
<p>except the egg in females and the sperm in males.</p>
<p>The egg in females and the sperm in males</p>
<p>are part of what&rsquo;s called the germline.</p>
<p>And again, it has nothing to do with infection.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the cells of the germline</p>
<p>have genes that cannot be modified</p>
<p>by the behavior of the individual</p>
<p>that houses those genes.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, if I were to tell you that by exercising,</p>
<p>you can improve mitochondrial function,</p>
<p>you can change hormones by reducing stress,</p>
<p>you can reduce cortisol by hitting puberty, for instance,</p>
<p>you will have the secretion of hormones</p>
<p>that then change gene expression in other cells</p>
<p>leading to development of body hair, facial hair,</p>
<p>deepening the voice, breast growth, et cetera.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d say, okay, great.</p>
<p>Yeah, that all makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s all occurring in the so-called somatic cells.</p>
<p>The germ cells or the germline cells,</p>
<p>that is the egg and the sperm,</p>
<p>are a very unique and protected set of cells</p>
<p>that are generated in a particular way</p>
<p>and whose genetic components</p>
<p>are not modifiable by experience.</p>
<p>And when you take a step back and you think about it,</p>
<p>you say, oh, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason to think that exercising</p>
<p>will make the children that you have not yet had stronger.</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>Well, why is that?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s because there is a barrier</p>
<p>between the genes of the germline cells and behaviors.</p>
<p>They cannot be modified by behaviors</p>
<p>and the various things that you do in your lifetime.</p>
<p>Now, I suppose there&rsquo;s an exception</p>
<p>in the negative direction.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m referring to here is</p>
<p>if you were to say, be exposed to a chemical</p>
<p>that could mutate the DNA of your egg or sperm,</p>
<p>or if you were to fertilize an embryo in a certain way</p>
<p>or at a certain stage of life,</p>
<p>that it got an extra chromosome, for instance,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about this a little bit later.</p>
<p>Well, then of course you could end up with offspring</p>
<p>that have modified DNA,</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t faithfully represent half of the genes from mom</p>
<p>and half of the genes from dad.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the same as specific behaviors</p>
<p>modifying the genes of those cells,</p>
<p>the sperm and the egg cells,</p>
<p>in a way that improves the offspring.</p>
<p>So the key first thing to understand today</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a distinction between somatic cells,</p>
<p>which is the vast majority of cells in your body</p>
<p>and the so-called germline cells,</p>
<p>which are the egg and the sperm.</p>
<p>The egg and the sperm are these highly protected populations</p>
<p>of cells that in females actually come to be</p>
<p>during embryogenesis, okay?</p>
<p>So for all females out there,</p>
<p>you generate what today I&rsquo;m going to refer to</p>
<p>as a vault of cells.</p>
<p>You have a vault of eggs that are your germline.</p>
<p>Those eggs all contain all the chromosomes of your DNA.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to be, as most of you know,</p>
<p>there are 23 chromosomes and chromosomes exist in pairs.</p>
<p>So the way to think about this is each pair is one strand</p>
<p>and you have 22 so-called autosomes</p>
<p>and then you have one sex chromosome.</p>
<p>The sex chromosome will be either X or Y.</p>
<p>So in a female, they have two X chromosomes.</p>
<p>So in each one of the eggs that a woman has</p>
<p>and that she&rsquo;s had since she was an embryo</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s contained in this vault,</p>
<p>those eggs are of course going to be very immature</p>
<p>at birth, right?</p>
<p>She hasn&rsquo;t undergone puberty yet.</p>
<p>And certainly as an embryo, she hasn&rsquo;t undergone puberty.</p>
<p>And those cells are going to contain 23 pairs of chromosomes.</p>
<p>Okay, this is very important, 23 pairs of chromosomes.</p>
<p>The chromosomes are essentially the wrapped up DNA</p>
<p>that contains all the genetic information</p>
<p>to create any cell type in the body</p>
<p>and actually to create an entirely new individual.</p>
<p>Now there are 23 pairs of chromosomes,</p>
<p>22 of which are called autosomes.</p>
<p>Okay, if that doesn&rsquo;t make sense to you,</p>
<p>just remember autosome, okay, there&rsquo;s 22 of them.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s one so-called sex chromosome.</p>
<p>The sex chromosomes are either X or Y, but this is a female.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s going to have 23 pairs of chromosomes</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s going to have two X chromosomes</p>
<p>for the sex chromosomes.</p>
<p>Okay, if this is already confusing to you, don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make it very clear how this all relates to fertility</p>
<p>and how it relates to chromosomal segregation</p>
<p>and a bunch of things that I think maybe you&rsquo;ve heard of</p>
<p>and that perhaps were opaque to you,</p>
<p>but I promise to make them clear.</p>
<p>But just understand that within each of those eggs,</p>
<p>they have 23 pairs of chromosomes.</p>
<p>And for those of you that like nomenclature,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you that those cells are considered diploid,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re called the diploid.</p>
<p>And that means that they have 23 pairs of chromosomes</p>
<p>as distinguished from cells that are haploid</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s only one set of those 23 chromosomes.</p>
<p>So instead of 23 pairs, there&rsquo;s only 23 chromosomes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll come back to haploid cells a little bit later.</p>
<p>Okay, so when a female is born,</p>
<p>she has all these eggs in the reserve,</p>
<p>in this vault that she&rsquo;ll have for her entire life.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not going to make any more,</p>
<p>but they are very, very immature.</p>
<p>So when a woman is in embryogenesis,</p>
<p>she develops these very immature eggs, okay?</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re also going to talk about follicles</p>
<p>and we will be careful to distinguish follicles from eggs.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re often talked about interchangeably online</p>
<p>and elsewhere, and even by fertility docs and OBGYNs.</p>
<p>But right now we&rsquo;re just talking about the egg cells, okay?</p>
<p>The eggs themselves, which are cells.</p>
<p>Now, the goal of fertilization is to bring that egg cell</p>
<p>into close enough proximity that it can be fertilized</p>
<p>by a single sperm cell.</p>
<p>And that sperm cell will bring 23 chromosomes as well</p>
<p>that include, just as in the female egg,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll have 22 autosomes and one sex chromosome.</p>
<p>And in the male, that sex chromosome</p>
<p>can either be an X chromosome,</p>
<p>which then would give rise to female offspring,</p>
<p>or a Y chromosome, which would give rise to male offspring.</p>
<p>And today we&rsquo;re not talking about sexual differentiation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a topic of a previous and yet another future episode.</p>
<p>But just to give you a sense of how X chromosomes</p>
<p>and Y chromosomes can actually accomplish</p>
<p>that sexual differentiation, both of body and brain,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just mention in two sentences that, for instance,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a Y chromosome as opposed to an X chromosome,</p>
<p>that Y chromosome contains genes that suppress,</p>
<p>for instance, the development of female genitalia,</p>
<p>and thereby give rise to male genitalia.</p>
<p>So rather than the formation of a clitoris,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the formation of a penis.</p>
<p>And rather than the formation of ovaries,</p>
<p>the formation of a testes, okay?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s more directed towards sexual differentiation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to get into that right now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get into that in a future episode.</p>
<p>But even if you&rsquo;re only tracking about 10%</p>
<p>of what I&rsquo;m saying right now,</p>
<p>I promise you&rsquo;re doing great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re tracking more than 10%,</p>
<p>well, then you&rsquo;re doing terrifically well.</p>
<p>Because the essence of fertility and fertilization</p>
<p>is to bring together that haploid cell that is the sperm</p>
<p>that only has 23 chromosomes,</p>
<p>but not pairs of chromosomes, right?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the DNA from dad,</p>
<p>together with the egg,</p>
<p>which as I told you already has 23 pairs of chromosomes.</p>
<p>So part of the fertilization process</p>
<p>has to be to get rid of one half of those 23 pairs</p>
<p>in the female.</p>
<p>You got to get rid of it.</p>
<p>And you have to get the egg in the sperm in proximity</p>
<p>so that the egg can potentially be fertilized by the sperm,</p>
<p>bringing the DNA,</p>
<p>the 23 single strands of chromosomes from dad</p>
<p>into a cell that has 23 single strands from mom, okay?</p>
<p>So I realize I&rsquo;m probably being a little bit repetitive here,</p>
<p>but I want everyone to understand this</p>
<p>because it really frames up fertility and reproduction</p>
<p>in the proper way.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a cell from mom, the egg,</p>
<p>which has 23 pairs of chromosomes.</p>
<p>We need to get rid of one set of those pairs</p>
<p>so that there&rsquo;s only 23 chromosomes.</p>
<p>We need to get rid of half of those chromosomes.</p>
<p>And then we need to bring that cell together physically</p>
<p>with the sperm cell</p>
<p>that contains the 23 chromosomal strands from dad.</p>
<p>And we need to bring those together</p>
<p>so that you get 23 chromosomal pairs from dad</p>
<p>and 23 chromosomal pairs from mom.</p>
<p>And in doing so, you create a cell</p>
<p>which then becomes multiple cells.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be the developing embryo</p>
<p>that has half the genes from mom</p>
<p>and half the genes from dad.</p>
<p>So I hope that&rsquo;s clear.</p>
<p>That is the biological logic,</p>
<p>which I realize is a bit of a tongue twister,</p>
<p>but forgive me.</p>
<p>It is the most accurate way to describe this process.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to bring together</p>
<p>the 23 single strands of chromosomes from dad</p>
<p>and the 23 single strands of chromosomes from mom</p>
<p>into the same cell.</p>
<p>Now that requires a literal physical contact</p>
<p>and pairing of the two cells.</p>
<p>But as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>all these eggs in mom are sitting in a vault</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very, very immature.</p>
<p>So the ovulatory cycle and the menstrual cycle</p>
<p>are really about first eliminating</p>
<p>half of the chromosomal pairs</p>
<p>in that 23 sets of chromosomes</p>
<p>and not getting rid of, for instance,</p>
<p>half, just going one to 11 or 12 to 23.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the goal.</p>
<p>The goal is to have chromosomes one, two, three, four,</p>
<p>five, six, all the way up to 23,</p>
<p>but only to have half of the chromosomes there.</p>
<p>And to bring that cell together</p>
<p>with the sperm cell physically,</p>
<p>then allow them to fuse</p>
<p>and allow the chromosomes from dad</p>
<p>and the chromosomes from mom</p>
<p>to fuse within a single cell</p>
<p>and duplicate into cells that contain</p>
<p>half of the chromosomes from dad</p>
<p>and half of the chromosomes from mom.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the ovulatory and menstrual cycle</p>
<p>are really all about.</p>
<p>So when thinking about it that way,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to just initiate the discussion</p>
<p>by focusing first on the female component</p>
<p>or the egg component of fertility and fertilization.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before,</p>
<p>a female has all the eggs,</p>
<p>albeit very immature eggs,</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;s going to have at the time that she&rsquo;s born.</p>
<p>Now, puberty will happen at some point</p>
<p>and will allow the ovulatory</p>
<p>and the menstrual cycle to commence.</p>
<p>Now, one question that you perhaps are asking is</p>
<p>what controls the onset of puberty?</p>
<p>And there are a number of different results,</p>
<p>each of which could be an entire episode</p>
<p>of a podcast on its own,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just highlight a few things that we know</p>
<p>about the onset of menses or menstruation,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s sometimes also called menarche, all right?</p>
<p>One thing that you&rsquo;ll notice about today&rsquo;s discussion</p>
<p>is that if you were to take any number of your notes online</p>
<p>and put them into a search function,</p>
<p>that you would see a lot of different language</p>
<p>used for the same thing.</p>
<p>So for instance, some people will talk about</p>
<p>the egg and the follicle as the same thing,</p>
<p>even though they are not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain the difference soon.</p>
<p>Some people will talk about menses or menstruation</p>
<p>or menarche as the exact same thing.</p>
<p>And in fact, they are not the exact same thing,</p>
<p>but oftentimes these words are used interchangeably.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do my best today to not overload you with nomenclature,</p>
<p>but rather to use the most commonly used terms</p>
<p>for the different aspects of fertility and fertilization.</p>
<p>But when it comes to the onset of puberty,</p>
<p>first of all, most of you have probably heard</p>
<p>that the onset of puberty is happening much earlier</p>
<p>in females now than it was some years ago.</p>
<p>And in fact, that is the case.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll talk about some statistics related to this,</p>
<p>which are pretty striking,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t necessarily point to anything detrimental.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that something bad is happening.</p>
<p>What do we know for sure?</p>
<p>Well, we know that there are a number of signals</p>
<p>that come both through the brain and through the body,</p>
<p>and more likely both,</p>
<p>in order to control the onset of puberty in females.</p>
<p>A couple of examples.</p>
<p>The first is a mechanistic one.</p>
<p>We know, for instance, that the entire process</p>
<p>of the ovulatory and menstrual cycle</p>
<p>is initiated from the brain.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to get into this in a lot more detail</p>
<p>in a few minutes,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a certain number of hormones</p>
<p>and neurotransmitters that are communicated from the brain,</p>
<p>a structure called the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>which roughly sits above the roof of your mouth,</p>
<p>and that communicates with a gland,</p>
<p>an endocrine or hormone-releasing gland</p>
<p>called the pituitary gland.</p>
<p>The pituitary gland looks like a stalk</p>
<p>that essentially extends out of the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also located not far from the roof of your mouth,</p>
<p>and that has two sort of small marble</p>
<p>or grape-sized protrusions,</p>
<p>the anterior pituitary and the posterior pituitary,</p>
<p>and they release different hormones into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Puberty is in part controlled by the fact</p>
<p>that up until puberty,</p>
<p>there are neurons in the hypothalamus</p>
<p>that release a neurotransmitter called GABA,</p>
<p>which is inhibitory,</p>
<p>and that prevents the neurons in the hypothalamus</p>
<p>from releasing a very important hormone</p>
<p>called gonadotropin-releasing hormone, or GNRH.</p>
<p>So the first thing I&rsquo;d really like everyone to know</p>
<p>and commit to memory today is very easy.</p>
<p>GNRH stands for gonadotropin-releasing hormone.</p>
<p>This comes from the brain</p>
<p>and will communicate to the pituitary</p>
<p>to release certain hormones.</p>
<p>Prior to puberty, in both males and females,</p>
<p>there are neurons in the brain</p>
<p>that are actively suppressing the neurons</p>
<p>that release GNRH.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like no puberty, no puberty, no puberty,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t have puberty, can&rsquo;t have puberty.</p>
<p>And in fact, those cells are releasing</p>
<p>this neurotransmitter called GABA</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s inhibitory,</p>
<p>prevents the firing of those neurons.</p>
<p>Okay, so puberty is actively suppressed</p>
<p>up until a certain point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also actively suppressed, at least in some species,</p>
<p>and we think at least partially in humans,</p>
<p>by the tonic release.</p>
<p>That means the ongoing release around the clock</p>
<p>of a hormone called melatonin.</p>
<p>Later in life, in fact, after puberty,</p>
<p>melatonin will be secreted only</p>
<p>in the dark phase of each night</p>
<p>and around the time that one goes to sleep.</p>
<p>But in children, and in particular in children</p>
<p>prior to puberty,</p>
<p>melatonin is released more or less constantly.</p>
<p>Now, melatonin isn&rsquo;t the only source</p>
<p>of suppression of puberty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also these neural mechanisms involving GABA,</p>
<p>but it is certainly a great candidate</p>
<p>for one of the reasons why puberty</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t generally tend to happen</p>
<p>at, say, age four or age five.</p>
<p>That would be very unusual.</p>
<p>Another component of suppression of puberty</p>
<p>is that typically in children,</p>
<p>they have relatively low body fat stores.</p>
<p>Why is this important?</p>
<p>Well, we know that one of the things</p>
<p>that can trigger the onset of puberty,</p>
<p>in particular in females,</p>
<p>is that when enough body fat accumulates,</p>
<p>that body fat releases a hormone called leptin,</p>
<p>and that hormone leptin travels in the bloodstream</p>
<p>across the blood-brain barrier</p>
<p>and goes to the hypothalamus</p>
<p>and can trigger the onset of puberty</p>
<p>by activating the neurons</p>
<p>that release gonadotropin-releasing hormone.</p>
<p>So many people believe that one of the reasons</p>
<p>that puberty is happening earlier and earlier in females</p>
<p>is because of the accumulation of more body fat</p>
<p>at younger ages than was observed 30 or 40,</p>
<p>and certainly 100 years ago.</p>
<p>Now, I can already imagine a number of people are thinking,</p>
<p>oh, this must relate to the obesity crisis.</p>
<p>And indeed, there is a crisis of obesity.</p>
<p>Obesity is something that is causing all sorts</p>
<p>of problems with people&rsquo;s health at various levels,</p>
<p>brain and body,</p>
<p>and that is far more frequent today</p>
<p>than it was even 20 years ago.</p>
<p>So it is indeed a crisis</p>
<p>because it has enormous detrimental effects</p>
<p>for so many aspects of brain and body health and longevity.</p>
<p>But this whole process of thinking about body fat</p>
<p>signaling leptin to the hypothalamus</p>
<p>and the onset of puberty</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to do with the obesity crisis.</p>
<p>It might relate,</p>
<p>but it could also relate to, for instance,</p>
<p>improved nutrition,</p>
<p>which is allowing body fat stores to accumulate,</p>
<p>maybe not to the level of obesity,</p>
<p>but to accumulate earlier and at younger ages in females,</p>
<p>which is then causing earlier puberty in females.</p>
<p>To just highlight how that might be possible,</p>
<p>I want to review some data</p>
<p>that talk about the onset of menses, menstruation,</p>
<p>that is puberty, in females,</p>
<p>according to country and according to age</p>
<p>over the last hundred or more years.</p>
<p>So what are the general trends</p>
<p>in terms of the onset of puberty in females?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s an easy one to answer.</p>
<p>Over the last hundred years or so,</p>
<p>the onset of puberty has been occurring much earlier</p>
<p>with each passing decade.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really an incredible set of statistics.</p>
<p>I will provide a link to these data</p>
<p>since I know a number of you are listening</p>
<p>and not just watching on YouTube.</p>
<p>This is from a study</p>
<p>in which the onset of puberty has been analyzed</p>
<p>from as early as the 1850s, right?</p>
<p>In certain countries, there are data on that,</p>
<p>out to the 1970s and in other countries,</p>
<p>starting at about 1900, extending out to about 1990.</p>
<p>These are ongoing collections of data,</p>
<p>but just to give you a sense</p>
<p>how the data are falling out</p>
<p>in a couple of different countries,</p>
<p>just to give you a flavor,</p>
<p>but for those of you listening</p>
<p>and for those of you watching,</p>
<p>the essence of all of these findings</p>
<p>is that puberty is happening much, much earlier</p>
<p>with each passing decade.</p>
<p>So for instance, in the United States,</p>
<p>around 1900 or 1903, the average age of menarche,</p>
<p>the onset of puberty in females was about 14 years old,</p>
<p>whereas in 1990, the average age is 11.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a pretty significant,</p>
<p>we can say acceleration of the onset of puberty.</p>
<p>Now, of course, these are averages,</p>
<p>so there will be exceptions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a distribution of data.</p>
<p>Today, still, there will be young females</p>
<p>who will undergo puberty at age 11 or 10,</p>
<p>or maybe even nine,</p>
<p>and others who will undergo puberty at age 13, 14,</p>
<p>maybe even 16 or 17.</p>
<p>However, if we look at, for instance,</p>
<p>the data from Norway, which dates back quite far,</p>
<p>they have excellent record keeping to 1850,</p>
<p>what we see is that the average age</p>
<p>of the onset of female puberty in 1850 in Norway</p>
<p>was 17 years old,</p>
<p>whereas in 1970, it&rsquo;s 13 years old.</p>
<p>So this is a dramatic acceleration of the onset of puberty.</p>
<p>And you see a similar trend in other countries as well.</p>
<p>So if we were to look in, for instance, in the UK,</p>
<p>they have a smaller data set,</p>
<p>meaning it only extends back to about 1940,</p>
<p>but the average age of the onset of puberty in the UK</p>
<p>in 1940 was 13 and a half years old.</p>
<p>Again, this is just for females.</p>
<p>And in 1970, it was closer to 13</p>
<p>with a trend towards declining even further.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they didn&rsquo;t continue to collect data</p>
<p>out to 2022.</p>
<p>And as a final point, if we were to look at, for instance,</p>
<p>in Germany and Finland,</p>
<p>the average onset of puberty in 1870</p>
<p>was 16 and a half years old,</p>
<p>by 1940, it was down to 13 and a half years old.</p>
<p>So all of these data have borne out over and over again,</p>
<p>regardless of location in the world, which is important,</p>
<p>because when you start to think about the obesity crisis,</p>
<p>you can say, well, that&rsquo;s mainly in developed countries,</p>
<p>believe it or not, or perhaps not surprisingly.</p>
<p>And maybe it has to do with the obesity crisis.</p>
<p>And yet, I don&rsquo;t think we can conclude that at all.</p>
<p>Something is happening, however.</p>
<p>It could be increased body fat stores</p>
<p>due to overeating and obesity.</p>
<p>However, it could also be unrelated to obesity.</p>
<p>It could be, for instance, improved nutrition</p>
<p>and the availability of quality nutrition,</p>
<p>which can signal the maturation</p>
<p>of the brain and body mechanisms</p>
<p>that trigger the onset of puberty,</p>
<p>ovulatory cycle, and menstruation.</p>
<p>So we want to be very careful about leaping to conclusions</p>
<p>about what these trends mean,</p>
<p>but the trends themselves are very, very apparent.</p>
<p>And as a final point, I should also mention</p>
<p>that there are a number of different behavioral</p>
<p>and psychosocial, as they&rsquo;re called, interactions</p>
<p>that can influence puberty as well.</p>
<p>This has been most strikingly observed in animals.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t want anyone to be alarmed</p>
<p>or to leap to any great conclusions</p>
<p>about the onset of timing of puberty in humans,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t tell you</p>
<p>about a certain result which shows</p>
<p>that if a young female is exposed to the odor,</p>
<p>not necessarily the pheromones, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a distinction between odors that we perceive</p>
<p>and pheromones, which are subconscious, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t actively perceive, but that can impact our biology.</p>
<p>And pheromone effects in humans are very controversial.</p>
<p>But we know, for instance, that if you take a female animal</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some evidence from humans</p>
<p>that if you take a young pre-pubertal female</p>
<p>and you expose her to the scent</p>
<p>of a reproductively competent male for a series of days,</p>
<p>but maybe even as short as a few hours,</p>
<p>and she is also not regularly being exposed</p>
<p>to the scent of her father,</p>
<p>that she can undergo puberty earlier.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>There is something about the odor and or pheromones,</p>
<p>or perhaps something else that occurs</p>
<p>when a young pre-pubertal female has a father</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;s in regular contact with.</p>
<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily have to live at home,</p>
<p>but that is around a lot, that his smell, excuse me,</p>
<p>is registered by her biological systems</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t want to say protects</p>
<p>because it kind of skews the valence of the conversation,</p>
<p>but that offsets or buffers the otherwise observed effect,</p>
<p>which is that the scent of a reproductively competent male,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s present often enough, or perhaps intensely enough,</p>
<p>that it can trigger the onset of puberty in that female.</p>
<p>In other words, the scent of a male that is not the father,</p>
<p>and we think also that is not biologically related to her,</p>
<p>can trigger earlier onset of puberty.</p>
<p>And that effect can at least be partially buffered</p>
<p>by her being in the presence of the scent</p>
<p>from her biological father.</p>
<p>Now, some of you are probably already leaping</p>
<p>to conclusions about what this means.</p>
<p>Should you not allow your daughter to be exposed</p>
<p>to any males who are of reproductive age, et cetera?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s certainly not what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge number of considerations</p>
<p>that go into that calculation</p>
<p>for everybody and circumstances, et cetera.</p>
<p>But the point is that the odors of individuals,</p>
<p>both related, in particular closely related,</p>
<p>and non-related individuals,</p>
<p>can shape the neural systems and the hormone systems</p>
<p>that can trigger the onset of puberty</p>
<p>or suppress the onset of puberty.</p>
<p>So whether or not we&rsquo;re talking about onset of puberty</p>
<p>at this age or that age,</p>
<p>and whether or not biologically related male</p>
<p>or non-biologically related male scents around, et cetera,</p>
<p>the thing I want everyone to know</p>
<p>is that at some point during development,</p>
<p>typically nowadays between the ages of 11 and 15 or so,</p>
<p>again, there&rsquo;s variability there,</p>
<p>the suppression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone</p>
<p>released from the hypothalamus is removed.</p>
<p>And then gonadotropin-releasing hormone</p>
<p>can activate cells within the pituitary.</p>
<p>And if you really want to know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the anterior pituitary in particular.</p>
<p>And then the anterior pituitary gland,</p>
<p>which sits at and kind of bridges the brain and the body</p>
<p>because it allows the release of hormones</p>
<p>into the bloodstream,</p>
<p>that anterior pituitary is going to release</p>
<p>two key hormones that everyone should know the name of</p>
<p>and what they do.</p>
<p>And when I say everyone,</p>
<p>I mean males and females need to know about these hormones</p>
<p>because they have an active role in both males and females.</p>
<p>And of course, you should want to know</p>
<p>and should know about the biology</p>
<p>of everyone on the planet, in my opinion,</p>
<p>because it tells you a lot more about humans</p>
<p>than if you just focus on your own biology.</p>
<p>But those two hormones are called luteinizing hormone,</p>
<p>which is abbreviated LH,</p>
<p>and follicle-stimulating hormone,</p>
<p>which is abbreviated FSH, okay?</p>
<p>So the simple picture that you need to have in your mind</p>
<p>is gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the brain,</p>
<p>from the hypothalamus in particular,</p>
<p>is causing the release of luteinizing hormone</p>
<p>and follicle-stimulating hormone.</p>
<p>GNRH stimulates LH, luteinizing hormone,</p>
<p>and follicle-stimulating hormone, FSH.</p>
<p>LH and FSH travel in the blood</p>
<p>and can access all the cells and tissues of the body.</p>
<p>This is one of the incredible things about hormones</p>
<p>is that many hormones,</p>
<p>and LH and FSH are included in this group,</p>
<p>can travel into cells</p>
<p>and they can actually change the genetic expression</p>
<p>of those cells.</p>
<p>They can change which genes are turned on</p>
<p>and which genes are turned off.</p>
<p>And they can also attach to the surface of those cells</p>
<p>and make those cells take on different properties.</p>
<p>So they can mature those cells.</p>
<p>So for instance, a good example of this</p>
<p>outside of the context we&rsquo;ve been talking about</p>
<p>is the hormone testosterone</p>
<p>can travel to the hair follicle</p>
<p>and can stimulate changes in the genes</p>
<p>of the cells of the hair follicle</p>
<p>that can make hair grow.</p>
<p>A different hormone, estrogen,</p>
<p>can travel to the cells of the breast tissue</p>
<p>and activate genes that control enlargement</p>
<p>of the cells of the breast tissue.</p>
<p>Prolactin, a different hormone,</p>
<p>can travel to the mammary ducts</p>
<p>and control the production and the secretion of milk.</p>
<p>And in males, that can actually happen in certain cases,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s rare,</p>
<p>but prolactin can also travel to areas of the brain</p>
<p>that control libido, for instance.</p>
<p>And just so you&rsquo;ll never forget it,</p>
<p>males&rsquo; elevated levels of prolactin</p>
<p>are actually what set the refractory period</p>
<p>after ejaculation and prevent erection</p>
<p>for some period of time.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll never forget prolactin.</p>
<p>The point being that different hormones</p>
<p>have different effects on different cells,</p>
<p>depending on what cells those are, right?</p>
<p>Estrogen or estradiol is going to have different effects</p>
<p>on the breast tissue than it would on skin,</p>
<p>although it has effects on both.</p>
<p>Similarly, when LH and FSH,</p>
<p>luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone,</p>
<p>travel in the blood to the gonad,</p>
<p>and the gonad is an ovary,</p>
<p>it will have a certain set of consequences.</p>
<p>And when luteinizing hormone</p>
<p>and follicle-stimulating hormone travel in the blood</p>
<p>to a gonad, and that gonad happens to be a testy,</p>
<p>then it will have a different set</p>
<p>of biological implications.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s focus now on what happens</p>
<p>when LH and FSH arrive at the ovary.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s assume now that we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>a female who has already undergone puberty,</p>
<p>or perhaps we could even frame this in the context</p>
<p>of a female who is about to undergo puberty.</p>
<p>FSH and LH are now able to be released</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s undergoing puberty,</p>
<p>but the same set of processes essentially would occur</p>
<p>for any point from puberty onward until menopause,</p>
<p>which is the depletion of that vault,</p>
<p>that ovarian reserve of all those immature eggs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a brief break</p>

<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;re now going to talk</p>
<p>about ovulation and menstruation,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s just remember what this is all about.</p>
<p>This is all about creating the potential</p>
<p>for an egg to be fertilized,</p>
<p>and that egg needs to have half of the chromosomal pair,</p>
<p>so no pairs, but it&rsquo;s got to have 23 chromosomes</p>
<p>just from mom, and we need to position that egg</p>
<p>so that the egg can be met by the sperm,</p>
<p>and that sperm can penetrate that egg</p>
<p>and donate its 23 individual strands of chromosomes</p>
<p>to that egg so that you can bring together the DNA</p>
<p>of dad and the DNA of mom.</p>
<p>So the ovulatory and menstrual cycle occurs</p>
<p>when luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone</p>
<p>have been released, and the ovulatory slash menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>and here I have to kind of pick what I want to call it.</p>
<p>I guess to be really accurate,</p>
<p>we would just call it the female reproductive cycle,</p>
<p>but that includes underneath it,</p>
<p>but the menstrual cycle, as it&rsquo;s sometimes called,</p>
<p>and the ovulatory cycle, so you decide.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to interchangeably discuss</p>
<p>the ovulatory cycle and the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>The problem is when you say menstruation,</p>
<p>people often think about just the period,</p>
<p>the shedding of the uterine lining</p>
<p>when fertilization has not occurred.</p>
<p>So if I start saying ovulatory cycle, just keep in mind,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m referring to the entire thing.</p>
<p>Now, this is probably also a good opportunity to say</p>
<p>that if you heard that the ovulatory slash menstrual cycle</p>
<p>is 28 days long, that&rsquo;s true in some cases,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not always true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on average 28 days long.</p>
<p>There are some females</p>
<p>for which the ovulatory cycle will be shorter,</p>
<p>can be as short as 21 days,</p>
<p>and other females for which it will be 35 days long.</p>
<p>Shorter than 21 days and longer than 35 days is rare,</p>
<p>although it does occur.</p>
<p>One of the key things when thinking about fertility</p>
<p>is if you talk to OBGYNs who are focused on fertility,</p>
<p>which I have in anticipation of this episode,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll tell you that whether or not your cycle</p>
<p>is 21 days long or 35 days long</p>
<p>is not as much of an issue necessarily</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s happening to become much shorter</p>
<p>or much longer in a kind of erratic way.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s consistently had</p>
<p>23 day long cycles,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden you&rsquo;re having 30 day long cycles,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not necessarily an indication of anything bad,</p>
<p>but if it&rsquo;s 21 days one month,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s 30 days the next month,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s 17 days the next month,</p>
<p>or even if it&rsquo;s always falling</p>
<p>within that 21 to 35 day long cycle,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very variable from each month</p>
<p>or every other month or so,</p>
<p>you probably want to talk to your OBGYN</p>
<p>because that could indicate a number of different things.</p>
<p>Which things could it indicate?</p>
<p>Well, that will become clear</p>
<p>as I spell out the biology in a bit more detail.</p>
<p>Okay, but this idea that the menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>ovulatory cycle is always 28 days,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just false, that&rsquo;s just not true.</p>
<p>I should also mention that there is a common misconception</p>
<p>that because the average menstrual cycle is 28 days,</p>
<p>indeed the average is 28 days,</p>
<p>and the lunar cycle is 28 days,</p>
<p>and of course there is real biology</p>
<p>to support the fact that the lunar cycle</p>
<p>can in fact impact certain aspects of human behavior.</p>
<p>It does, and we&rsquo;ll talk about lunar cycles</p>
<p>in a future episode,</p>
<p>but there is zero data to support the idea</p>
<p>that the menstrual cycle and the lunar cycle</p>
<p>are linked in any kind of causal way.</p>
<p>Sorry to break it to you,</p>
<p>the lunar cycle and the tidal cycles at the ocean</p>
<p>are definitely linked in ways that are super interesting</p>
<p>related to the tilt of the earth</p>
<p>and the pull of gravity of different planets,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an incredible story into itself,</p>
<p>but the lunar cycle and the menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>despite having some weak correlation</p>
<p>in terms of their duration,</p>
<p>or their so-called periodicity, no pun intended,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s no causal relationship whatsoever</p>
<p>between the lunar cycle and the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>If any of you are aware of any real data</p>
<p>that conflict with what I just said,</p>
<p>please put that in the comment section on YouTube,</p>
<p>but this is pretty well-established as far as I know.</p>
<p>Okay, so we need to bring together</p>
<p>the so-called haploid contents,</p>
<p>the 23 individual strands of chromosomes from the egg</p>
<p>to a place in a position</p>
<p>where it could potentially be fertilized by the male.</p>
<p>So what happens?</p>
<p>Luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone</p>
<p>travel to the ovary.</p>
<p>These hormones are able to access the ovary.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of blood supply to the ovary,</p>
<p>and FSH and LH arrive at the ovary.</p>
<p>The ovary has this vault,</p>
<p>this ovarian reserve of immature cells.</p>
<p>They reside within what are called follicles.</p>
<p>The follicles are little spherical packages</p>
<p>that can potentially provide a nice environment</p>
<p>for those eggs to mature.</p>
<p>And when FSH in particular arrives at the ovary,</p>
<p>a small number of those follicles</p>
<p>will split off from the reserve.</p>
<p>They will exit the vault</p>
<p>and they will undergo maturation.</p>
<p>And the key player here is follicle-stimulating hormone.</p>
<p>And the first 14 days of the menstrual ovulatory cycle</p>
<p>is referred to as the follicular phase</p>
<p>because of this relationship between FSH</p>
<p>triggering the maturation of a subset of follicles.</p>
<p>Now, typically in the context of a 28-day or so</p>
<p>ovulatory menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>day one is designated as the first day of the period</p>
<p>of the shedding of the uterine lining</p>
<p>from the previous ovulatory menstrual cycle</p>
<p>in which fertilization did not occur, okay?</p>
<p>So day one is when the period initiates.</p>
<p>It is days one through 14 approximately, right?</p>
<p>Because here we&rsquo;re just considering</p>
<p>the average of a 28-day cycle,</p>
<p>but it could be longer, it could be shorter.</p>
<p>But the first half of that cycle</p>
<p>is the so-called follicular phase.</p>
<p>FSH has triggered the departure</p>
<p>of a subset of these follicles that contain immature eggs.</p>
<p>And it is triggering the maturation of those eggs.</p>
<p>Luteinizing hormone is also present,</p>
<p>but also at relatively low levels.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s during the first half</p>
<p>of this ovulatory menstrual cycle</p>
<p>that the main goal is to get those follicles to mature.</p>
<p>So inside of those follicles, the egg is developing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s growing, it&rsquo;s maturing.</p>
<p>And in doing so, it&rsquo;s also making its own hormones.</p>
<p>This I think is one of the most elegant aspects</p>
<p>of the ovulatory menstrual cycle</p>
<p>that in a few minutes, you&rsquo;ll learn about something</p>
<p>which still to this day,</p>
<p>even though I&rsquo;ve known about this stuff for decades now,</p>
<p>because of my training, still just blows my mind</p>
<p>that you have one hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone,</p>
<p>triggering the maturation of some eggs</p>
<p>inside of some follicles.</p>
<p>And then those follicles themselves making another hormone</p>
<p>that furthers the process.</p>
<p>And then soon, as you&rsquo;ll learn,</p>
<p>create a hormone to trigger the second half of the process.</p>
<p>Just a beautiful symphony of expression</p>
<p>of different genes and different hormones</p>
<p>to make everything work as optimally as possible.</p>
<p>So as these different follicles mature somehow,</p>
<p>and we still don&rsquo;t know exactly how,</p>
<p>one of those follicles containing an egg gets selected.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s either because it matures the fastest</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s something about it</p>
<p>that is still not completely understood</p>
<p>that allows it to be selected.</p>
<p>And all the other follicles that are maturing</p>
<p>degenerate and die, and they&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t go back into the ovarian reserve.</p>
<p>They are now depleted from that bank account</p>
<p>that is the ovarian reserve.</p>
<p>They die off, but that single egg that, keep in mind,</p>
<p>contains 23 pairs of chromosomes, right?</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t gotten rid of one half</p>
<p>of those 23 sets of chromosomes yet,</p>
<p>but that one will continue to mature.</p>
<p>And then at some point,</p>
<p>that egg will start to undergo a process</p>
<p>in which those chromosomes are pulled apart</p>
<p>by little components within the egg called spindles.</p>
<p>They literally have a physical pulling</p>
<p>of the chromosomes apart.</p>
<p>So now those 23 pairs are no longer attached</p>
<p>to one another at the middle, like they were before,</p>
<p>like two beads of strings,</p>
<p>or I should say 23 short strands of beads</p>
<p>that were at once connected to one another</p>
<p>now are pulled apart so that you have 23 chromosomes</p>
<p>on each side, but they&rsquo;re pulled apart from one another,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So that diploid cell is now starting to become a cell</p>
<p>in which half of the chromosomes, half of those 23 pairs</p>
<p>are physically pulled away from the others.</p>
<p>And then the egg actually starts to form its own,</p>
<p>what we call an involution of membrane</p>
<p>around those 23 pairs, one set of them,</p>
<p>and encapsulates them.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve sort of got an egg with two parts</p>
<p>where the two sets of chromosomes,</p>
<p>two sets of 23 chromosomes are now separate</p>
<p>from one another inside of the egg.</p>
<p>And then one of those actually gets ejected from the egg.</p>
<p>And the name of that thing that gets ejected,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of like a little Hubble pod is how I imagine it,</p>
<p>you know, from, from Star Wars, you know,</p>
<p>or from any kind of a space odyssey movie</p>
<p>where something is ready to happen.</p>
<p>You know, the little Hubble pod shoots out of the ship.</p>
<p>Well, that 23 pairs is now ejected from the egg.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the polar body and that&rsquo;s going to degenerate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to go away.</p>
<p>And in doing so, take the egg cell,</p>
<p>which was once diploid, it had 23 pairs of chromosomes</p>
<p>and making it haploid.</p>
<p>And now what you&rsquo;ve got in ideal circumstances</p>
<p>is a beautifully pristine egg that was selected for</p>
<p>and has 23 single strands of chromosomes,</p>
<p>22 autosomes and one sex chromosome.</p>
<p>And that sex chromosome is going to be an X chromosome</p>
<p>almost with certainty because female mother</p>
<p>is creating that egg.</p>
<p>So then the egg that contains just the appropriate</p>
<p>23 single stranded chromosomes</p>
<p>is going to fuse with the wall of the ovary.</p>
<p>And that egg will be released</p>
<p>and will travel into the fallopian tube.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ll get back to that egg in a few moments,</p>
<p>but that process, which represents the first half</p>
<p>of the ovulatory menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>again, was triggered by FSH</p>
<p>and to some extent luteinizing hormone,</p>
<p>but it is the ongoing maturation of that egg,</p>
<p>which also causes the production of estrogen,</p>
<p>which allows that whole process to occur.</p>
<p>And you could say, why?</p>
<p>Well, the answer to the why</p>
<p>is a very important biological principle</p>
<p>that we are going to return to</p>
<p>in a number of different contexts today,</p>
<p>both as reference to female and male fertility.</p>
<p>And the principle is a so-called negative feedback.</p>
<p>So when estrogen is present at relatively low levels</p>
<p>in females, in the ovary,</p>
<p>as it is during the development of these eggs,</p>
<p>some of that estrogen, of course,</p>
<p>is going to exit the ovary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to go into the bloodstream</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to travel back to the pituitary.</p>
<p>Now the pituitary can release things</p>
<p>like follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone.</p>
<p>But the way I&rsquo;d like you to think about the pituitary</p>
<p>for sake of feedback loops</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s sort of like a thermometer</p>
<p>that you would put into a pool,</p>
<p>like a backyard pool,</p>
<p>that is attached to the heater.</p>
<p>And for instance,</p>
<p>if you were to put a thermometer into a pool</p>
<p>that you would like to keep at 70 degrees</p>
<p>and the temperature of that pool is 60 degrees,</p>
<p>well, then that thermometer ought to trigger</p>
<p>some sort of mechanism where the pool would heat up</p>
<p>until the temperature of the pool hit 70 degrees.</p>
<p>And then it should trigger that thermometer</p>
<p>to turn off the heating system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of a negative feedback system</p>
<p>that would keep the temperature more or less correct.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of the way that the systems related to estrogen</p>
<p>and also testosterone and these different things</p>
<p>like luteinizing hormone</p>
<p>and follicle stimulating hormone work as well.</p>
<p>Typically, when the level of a hormone is too high,</p>
<p>then it shuts down the production of the hormones</p>
<p>that would trigger further production of that hormone.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s a mouthful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot to think about.</p>
<p>And some of you are probably thinking,</p>
<p>whoa, I&rsquo;m getting dizzy now with biology,</p>
<p>but I promise you can understand this.</p>
<p>In females, when estrogen is relatively low,</p>
<p>but not zero,</p>
<p>but is relatively low during that first follicular half</p>
<p>of the ovulatory cycle,</p>
<p>it actually triggers negative feedback on LH and FSH</p>
<p>so that not too much is produced.</p>
<p>But then just prior to ovulation,</p>
<p>the levels of estrogen</p>
<p>and the levels of some other hormones from those eggs,</p>
<p>right, you have the eggs producing estrogen themselves,</p>
<p>gets high enough that it actually triggers</p>
<p>a positive feedback loop on the pituitary.</p>
<p>So the pituitary is essentially observing</p>
<p>the amount of estrogen in the bloodstream</p>
<p>produced by the ovary</p>
<p>and the amount of estrogen</p>
<p>towards the end of the second half of the menstrual cycle</p>
<p>has increased and triggers a positive feedback loop.</p>
<p>It triggers the pituitary to release more FSH and LH,</p>
<p>and that helps trigger ovulation, okay?</p>
<p>That deployment or the release of that one mature,</p>
<p>proper selected egg with the taploid,</p>
<p>with the 23 individual pairs of chromosomes</p>
<p>into the fallopian tube.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just back up really quickly</p>
<p>and just kind of summarize what&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>Gonadotropin releasing hormone from the hypothalamus</p>
<p>triggers the release of follicle stimulating hormone</p>
<p>and luteinizing hormone.</p>
<p>That travels to the ovary,</p>
<p>triggers the release of a subset of immature follicles</p>
<p>with immature eggs.</p>
<p>Those immature follicles and immature eggs start to mature,</p>
<p>start to grow because of the presence</p>
<p>of follicle stimulating hormone.</p>
<p>The growth of those eggs themselves increases estrogen.</p>
<p>As the estrogen starts to accumulate in the environment,</p>
<p>some of that travels back to the pituitary.</p>
<p>And when levels of estrogen arriving at the pituitary</p>
<p>are relatively low, the pituitary says,</p>
<p>oh, we don&rsquo;t need to release any more follicle stimulating</p>
<p>and luteinizing hormone.</p>
<p>However, at some point, just prior to ovulation,</p>
<p>enough estrogen has been produced</p>
<p>by that one single selected mature egg</p>
<p>and some of the other follicles around it</p>
<p>that were maturing, but then since died off,</p>
<p>that the estrogen triggers a positive feedback loop.</p>
<p>The pituitary says, okay,</p>
<p>and releases more follicle stimulating hormone</p>
<p>and luteinizing hormone.</p>
<p>And bam, the egg,</p>
<p>which has the proper genetic components,</p>
<p>sets off out of the ovary and into the fallopian tube.</p>
<p>So-called ovulation has begun, okay?</p>
<p>That itself, what I just described,</p>
<p>constitutes the first half</p>
<p>of the ovulatory menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>which we call the follicular phase.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s marked by the presence of FSH</p>
<p>and some other things,</p>
<p>but we can really think about it</p>
<p>as marked by FSH from the pituitary</p>
<p>and by estrogen or estradiol made within the ovary.</p>
<p>Okay, then comes the second half</p>
<p>of the ovulatory menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>which I personally think is one of the coolest mechanisms</p>
<p>in all of biology,</p>
<p>which is that, remember the follicle that housed</p>
<p>that one egg that was the selected egg</p>
<p>that became the mature egg?</p>
<p>And that follicle, which no longer contains the egg,</p>
<p>because the egg took off and ovulated,</p>
<p>is called the corpus luteum.</p>
<p>And the corpus luteum starts making three hormones,</p>
<p>which include estradiol, a thing called inhibin,</p>
<p>but the most important hormone,</p>
<p>the one that you really need to know about,</p>
<p>is that it starts producing</p>
<p>very high levels of progesterone.</p>
<p>Progesterone levels start to increase</p>
<p>about the time of ovulation,</p>
<p>although just prior to ovulation.</p>
<p>And over the next second half of the ovulatory cycle,</p>
<p>so about 14 days, if it&rsquo;s a 28-day cycle,</p>
<p>a little bit longer, a little bit shorter,</p>
<p>depending on the length of the cycle,</p>
<p>levels of progesterone in the second half</p>
<p>of the ovulatory cycle are going to increase by 1,400-fold</p>
<p>compared to what they were in the first half</p>
<p>of the ovulatory cycle.</p>
<p>So again, if we were to characterize</p>
<p>the menstrual ovulatory cycle in broad strokes,</p>
<p>what we would say is that FSH and estrogen</p>
<p>mark the initial part, the first half,</p>
<p>so-called follicular phase,</p>
<p>and that the estrogen and FSH set in motion ovulation,</p>
<p>and they prime the system</p>
<p>for the production of a corpus luteum,</p>
<p>which produces progesterone.</p>
<p>And the second half of all of this</p>
<p>is called the luteal phase.</p>
<p>The second half of the ovulatory menstrual cycle</p>
<p>is the luteal phase because of corpus luteum.</p>
<p>This otherwise discarded tissue that produces progesterone.</p>
<p>What does progesterone do?</p>
<p>Well, progesterone impacts the uterine lining,</p>
<p>so-called endometrium, or the lining,</p>
<p>the mucous lining of the uterus,</p>
<p>where that egg that&rsquo;s ovulated</p>
<p>is potentially going to implant if it&rsquo;s fertilized.</p>
<p>And so in a kind of perfect way,</p>
<p>or I should say in a seemingly perfect way,</p>
<p>the egg is off on its way, it might get fertilized.</p>
<p>The remnants of the compartment that let go of that egg</p>
<p>produce a hormone that then prepares</p>
<p>the endometrial lining of the uterus</p>
<p>for the potential implantation of that egg.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically making the bed for the fertilized egg</p>
<p>to potentially embed in, to implant in,</p>
<p>and then achieve all the nourishment that it needs</p>
<p>to grow eventually into a healthy embryo and child.</p>
<p>Just an amazing set of biological mechanisms,</p>
<p>if you ask me, because what you&rsquo;re observing here</p>
<p>is an incredible economy of function,</p>
<p>whereby the same cellular components</p>
<p>that are producing the egg,</p>
<p>well, some of them are being discarded,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not being discarded without purpose.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re being discarded in a way that triggers</p>
<p>the onset of hormonal expression</p>
<p>that then prepares the fertilized egg</p>
<p>to be in an enriched environment in which it can thrive.</p>
<p>Now, I realize that was a lot of detail,</p>
<p>but we have a couple of key themes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got the hypothalamus, GnRH.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got the pituitary with LH and FSH,</p>
<p>and those hormones travel to the ovary.</p>
<p>The ovary has eggs in a vault,</p>
<p>basically immature eggs in a vault.</p>
<p>Some of those are activated by the presence of FSH and LH</p>
<p>each month, and one of those eggs will be selected</p>
<p>and will ovulate.</p>
<p>The remnants of the follicle and egg that are not selected,</p>
<p>the chromosomes that you don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>or disappear in the polar body,</p>
<p>and the corpus luteum gives rise to progesterone</p>
<p>and sets in motion the second half</p>
<p>of the ovulatory menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>which is the luteal phase,</p>
<p>which is essentially the potential for that fertilized egg</p>
<p>to embed in a nice nourishing environment.</p>
<p>And of course, we should all be thinking</p>
<p>if the egg is fertilized,</p>
<p>and then it lays down in the nice comfy uterine lining</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been prepared by progesterone and the corpus luteum,</p>
<p>well, then everything&rsquo;s fine and good.</p>
<p>But what if fertilization doesn&rsquo;t occur?</p>
<p>Well, we all know what happens</p>
<p>if fertilization doesn&rsquo;t occur.</p>
<p>If fertilization does not occur for whatever reason,</p>
<p>that uterine lining is going to shed,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s actually what&rsquo;s referred to as the period.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the actual removal or the departure, rather,</p>
<p>of the thickened endometrium lining of the uterus</p>
<p>when fertilization has not occurred.</p>
<p>And of course, if that happens,</p>
<p>we need another ovulatory menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>So how does that happen?</p>
<p>Well, the hormone inhibin is also made by the corpus luteum</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t go quite as high as the hormone progesterone,</p>
<p>but it kind of tracks that increase in progesterone</p>
<p>that occurs in the second half of the ovulatory cycle.</p>
<p>But then if fertilization does not occur,</p>
<p>inhibin levels start to drop.</p>
<p>And what I haven&rsquo;t told you is what inhibin does.</p>
<p>Inhibin, in concert with other hormones like estrogen,</p>
<p>feed back to the hypothalamus</p>
<p>and prevent the further release</p>
<p>of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone.</p>
<p>If you have an egg that gets fertilized and can implant,</p>
<p>well, then you don&rsquo;t want more eggs to mature, right?</p>
<p>You want to hold on to the ones in the vault.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want them to mature.</p>
<p>And hormones like inhibin,</p>
<p>and again, working with other hormones,</p>
<p>are going to prevent the secretion</p>
<p>of things like FSH and LH.</p>
<p>Now, typically people are not getting pregnant every month.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>And part of the reason it&rsquo;s not possible</p>
<p>is that if the fertilized egg implants,</p>
<p>there are a number of different hormone cascades</p>
<p>that shut down the production of things like GNRH, FSH,</p>
<p>and LH in ways that prevent further maturation of follicles</p>
<p>in a follicular phase.</p>
<p>But in the instance where fertilization doesn&rsquo;t occur</p>
<p>and menstruation occurs,</p>
<p>and I should mention that the duration of menstruation,</p>
<p>the actual bleeding,</p>
<p>typically is anywhere from one to five days.</p>
<p>The quote-unquote heaviness,</p>
<p>the lightness or heaviness of that bleeding</p>
<p>will depend on, you guessed it,</p>
<p>the amount of progesterone</p>
<p>that is secreted from the corpus luteum.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the key players there.</p>
<p>And if menstruation occurs,</p>
<p>well then inhibin levels also drop,</p>
<p>progesterone levels also drop.</p>
<p>And when that occurs,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a positive feedback signal</p>
<p>up at the level of the pituitary.</p>
<p>The pituitary literally can register</p>
<p>how much inhibin and progesterone and estrogen</p>
<p>is present in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>And if those levels are sufficiently low,</p>
<p>well then GNRH gets secreted again,</p>
<p>FSH gets secreted again,</p>
<p>and then LH gets secreted again.</p>
<p>And the first half,</p>
<p>the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle</p>
<p>initiates all over again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to overstate how beautifully orchestrated</p>
<p>this entire system is,</p>
<p>the number of feedback loops and feed-forward loops.</p>
<p>I think if you can just generally understand</p>
<p>that the first half of the menstrual ovulatory cycle</p>
<p>is marked by the maturation of the follicles in FSH,</p>
<p>and that the second half</p>
<p>is marked by the accumulation of progesterone</p>
<p>and the thickening of the uterine lining</p>
<p>should fertilization and implantation occur,</p>
<p>I think that you will certainly understand</p>
<p>the female reproductive cycle</p>
<p>better than most people out there.</p>
<p>It will also help you understand a number of things</p>
<p>that are sometimes associated</p>
<p>with the female reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>For instance, there are data showing that in many, not all,</p>
<p>but in many women,</p>
<p>in the four to five days prior to ovulation,</p>
<p>there is a dramatic increase in libido.</p>
<p>That dramatic increase in libido</p>
<p>is triggered by a number of things,</p>
<p>but some of those things include</p>
<p>the spike in FSH that occurs,</p>
<p>the spike in LH that occurs,</p>
<p>and some associated increases in androgens,</p>
<p>things like DHEA and testosterone,</p>
<p>which just as in males can be related to libido,</p>
<p>in females trigger libido.</p>
<p>You can imagine why this would be an effective mechanism</p>
<p>to have in place in females</p>
<p>if the goal, as it were, certainly of the egg,</p>
<p>perhaps not of the woman as a whole,</p>
<p>but if the goal is to fertilize the egg.</p>
<p>So increases in libido</p>
<p>just prior to the onset of ovulation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also been a lot of discussion and interest,</p>
<p>and frankly, data,</p>
<p>exploring the malaise that can occur</p>
<p>at certain portions of the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of misconception about this.</p>
<p>A lot of people have focused on the malaise</p>
<p>that can occur around the time of bleeding,</p>
<p>but there are actually stronger data</p>
<p>to support the fact that some, again, some,</p>
<p>not all women experience a kind of malaise,</p>
<p>sometimes associated with anxiety, sometimes not,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s associated with the mid to second half</p>
<p>of the luteal phase of the ovulatory menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>And that, despite what people commonly think,</p>
<p>is not associated with elevated levels of estrogen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually associated with the depletion</p>
<p>in estrogen levels that can occur</p>
<p>during certain portions of that second half</p>
<p>of the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>So again, this is highly variable.</p>
<p>You know, for some people,</p>
<p>they might not experience any malaise</p>
<p>at any point during their menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>Other individuals also, for instance,</p>
<p>might not experience any variation in their libido</p>
<p>at any point during their menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>Again, highly variable,</p>
<p>and yet there are some statistically significant trends</p>
<p>that have been observed</p>
<p>that track to very specific hormonal components</p>
<p>within the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>Again, this will all be very contextual.</p>
<p>And of course, this can play out</p>
<p>in a number of different ways.</p>
<p>So for instance, some women experience</p>
<p>very heightened levels of sensitivity to caffeine</p>
<p>at certain portions of their menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>Other women experience more cramping than others</p>
<p>different portions of their menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>Tremendous variation from individual to individual.</p>
<p>One of the, I view it as an advantage,</p>
<p>but one of the things that many females</p>
<p>can really do and experience</p>
<p>because they have cycles that occur every month</p>
<p>that are fairly dramatic</p>
<p>in terms of the levels of hormones.</p>
<p>So for instance, a more than thousand-fold increase</p>
<p>in progesterone during the luteal phase</p>
<p>of the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>And I should also mention a 200-fold increase in estrogen</p>
<p>during the period just prior to ovulation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they always say estrogen primes progesterone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you learn in kind of basic endocrinology</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re learning the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>Estrogen in the first half of the menstrual cycle</p>
<p>primes progesterone in the second half</p>
<p>of the ovulatory menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>Well, that those estrogen increases just prior to ovulation</p>
<p>are in part responsible for the increases in libido,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also the presence of increased androgen</p>
<p>just prior to ovulation.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of complex interplay.</p>
<p>I think what we will do is we will reserve the discussion</p>
<p>about libido per se,</p>
<p>and some of the other aspects</p>
<p>related to sexual differentiation</p>
<p>that we were talking about earlier for a future episode.</p>
<p>But hopefully now you have in mind</p>
<p>what the ovulatory menstrual cycle is.</p>
<p>It is a signal from the brain, from the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>which then triggers a signal from the pituitary,</p>
<p>an endocrine gland,</p>
<p>which then signals the release of hormones</p>
<p>that travel to the ovary and that control two things,</p>
<p>maturation of eggs</p>
<p>and the identification of one egg in particular,</p>
<p>and then preparation of the milieu,</p>
<p>the environment in which that fertilized egg</p>
<p>could potentially land and mature</p>
<p>into a healthy embryo and child.</p>
<p>So if you have that framed up in your mind,</p>
<p>and even if you just extracted</p>
<p>maybe 10 to 15% of the hormones</p>
<p>and different aspects that I described up until now,</p>
<p>I would consider you far more knowledgeable</p>
<p>about this entire process than 99% of people out there,</p>
<p>certainly not the OBGYNs and urologists,</p>
<p>but the 99% of individuals out there.</p>
<p>It also frames up for us</p>
<p>the second half of this whole story</p>
<p>about fertility and fertilization,</p>
<p>which is the generation of sperm</p>
<p>and how the sperm eventually arrive at the egg</p>
<p>and how certain sperm are selected</p>
<p>to potentially fertilize that egg,</p>
<p>whereas others never really stand a chance.</p>
<p>So next, we&rsquo;re going to talk about sperm.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about what sperm are,</p>
<p>where they are generated and how they are generated,</p>
<p>and how they need to travel both within the male</p>
<p>and within the female</p>
<p>in order to allow fertilization to potentially occur.</p>

<p>So we&rsquo;ve covered the ovulatory cycle in females.</p>
<p>And I confess it was a lot of information</p>
<p>with a lot of biological nomenclature,</p>
<p>but I promise you that many of those same themes</p>
<p>and indeed the same names and nomenclature</p>
<p>will show up in the discussion that we&rsquo;re going to have now,</p>
<p>which is about the generation of sperm.</p>
<p>Now, sperm are similar to eggs</p>
<p>in the sense that they are part of the germline.</p>
<p>They are these protected cells,</p>
<p>protect in the sense that the activities of an individual</p>
<p>are not going to change the genetic makeup of those cells.</p>
<p>Now, again, there are instances in which mutagens,</p>
<p>such as chemicals, could disrupt the genomes</p>
<p>of the germ cells in males, just as it could in females.</p>
<p>But in general, the activities, the things that we do,</p>
<p>the experiences we have,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t tend to change the genome of those cells.</p>
<p>However, there are a lot of lifestyle factors,</p>
<p>do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts, nutrition and supplements</p>
<p>and prescription drugs, et cetera,</p>
<p>that can indeed modify the quality of the sperm.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about what sperm quality means.</p>
<p>But the point is that the sperm cell,</p>
<p>much like the egg cell, are both germline cells.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not like somatic cells.</p>
<p>They are unique populations.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s just remember what the job of the sperm cell is.</p>
<p>The job of the sperm cell is to deliver the genetic material</p>
<p>from the father and to do that in the form</p>
<p>of a haploid cell.</p>
<p>So that means 23 chromosomes, 22 autosomes,</p>
<p>one so-called sex chromosome.</p>
<p>Again, not sex the verb, at least not in this case.</p>
<p>Sex the verb is a discussion we&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>in a few minutes.</p>
<p>But sex the noun.</p>
<p>The sex chromosome can either be an X chromosome</p>
<p>or a Y chromosome.</p>
<p>Okay, so 22 autosomes and then one sex chromosome</p>
<p>is going to be contained within the sperm</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a haploid cell, not a diploid cell.</p>
<p>Remember the egg was diploid, then it became haploid.</p>
<p>The sperm cells are cells that are created</p>
<p>through the division of other cells.</p>
<p>But after that division occurs</p>
<p>through a process called meiosis,</p>
<p>the sperm cell is going to contain 23 chromosomes</p>
<p>consisting of 22 autosomes and one sex chromosome.</p>
<p>And the sperm that manages to deposit its DNA contents</p>
<p>into the egg to fertilize the egg</p>
<p>will either have an X sex chromosome or a Y sex chromosome.</p>
<p>And the Y sex chromosome has a number of different genes</p>
<p>on that chromosome that will suppress, for instance,</p>
<p>the development of the female reproductive axis.</p>
<p>A good example would be the mullerian inhibiting hormone</p>
<p>or MIH, the gene for mullerian inhibiting hormone,</p>
<p>which is a hormone that prevents the formation</p>
<p>of the mullerian ducts,</p>
<p>which is part of the female reproductive structure.</p>
<p>Well, that gene controls the prevention</p>
<p>of the development of the female genitalia.</p>
<p>And in doing so,</p>
<p>promotes the development of the male genitalia.</p>
<p>And there are other examples of genes</p>
<p>that are on the Y chromosome</p>
<p>that give you a, what we call male phenotype, right?</p>
<p>You have genotype and phenotype.</p>
<p>By the way, in case you haven&rsquo;t heard this in a while</p>
<p>from your high school biology,</p>
<p>or if you never heard it, no big deal.</p>
<p>Karyotype is the complement of chromosome XX or XY.</p>
<p>And there are individuals out there that are XXY or XYY,</p>
<p>a discussion for our episode on sex differentiation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s karyotype with a K.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s genotype, which are the genes that you have.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s phenotype, spelled P-H,</p>
<p>P-H-E-N-O-T-Y-P-E, phenotype.</p>
<p>And the phenotype is how the genes,</p>
<p>which then code for RNA, which code for protein,</p>
<p>how those are expressed in terms of things like eye color.</p>
<p>So eye color is a phenotype.</p>
<p>Height is a phenotype.</p>
<p>Hair color is a phenotype.</p>
<p>Okay, so you have karyotype, genotype, and phenotype.</p>
<p>Well, what we need to do is we need to bring together</p>
<p>that sperm, which is haploid.</p>
<p>It contains those 23 chromosomal strands</p>
<p>with either an X or a Y.</p>
<p>Sex chromosome is the 23rd chromosome.</p>
<p>We need to get that cell to the egg.</p>
<p>And so when we talk about spermatogenesis,</p>
<p>of course, we&rsquo;re talking about the generation</p>
<p>of sperm cells, but what we&rsquo;re really talking about</p>
<p>is the generation of cells whose job</p>
<p>is to deliver the genetic material from dad to the egg</p>
<p>within the female in a way that increases the probability</p>
<p>that not only will that egg be fertilized,</p>
<p>but that it will progress in a healthy way</p>
<p>with each set of chromosomes from mom and from dad,</p>
<p>each set of 23 chromosomes, that is,</p>
<p>will progress in a healthy way,</p>
<p>will implant in a healthy way, and will maintain</p>
<p>and grow in a healthy way to a healthy embryo</p>
<p>and child and eventually adult.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the job of the sperm, okay?</p>
<p>So as we talk about spermatogenesis,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just remember that and why they&rsquo;re there</p>
<p>in the first place.</p>
<p>Now, a few things about sperm that are interesting</p>
<p>besides the fact that they&rsquo;re haploid</p>
<p>and besides the fact that, as you all know, they swim,</p>
<p>they have a head and a tail.</p>
<p>They actually have a head, a mid-region, and a tail,</p>
<p>and that mid-region turns out to be very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ll come back to again and again.</p>
<p>That mid-region is really key for the ability for sperm</p>
<p>to engage in forward progression, to swim forward,</p>
<p>and involves the activity of mitochondria,</p>
<p>which are involved in generation of ATP,</p>
<p>which is involved in all aspects of energy in all cells.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s just remember that the sperm are swimming cells.</p>
<p>And in order to create a really good swimmer</p>
<p>or set of swimmers, you need a couple of things.</p>
<p>First of all, within the testes is where the sperm develop.</p>
<p>And unlike in females and unlike in the ovary,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no vault of sperm.</p>
<p>The sperm are continually being generated.</p>
<p>It takes about 60 days for sperm to be born</p>
<p>from their parent cells,</p>
<p>because cells actually give rise to other cells,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the way it works,</p>
<p>to be born from their parent cells</p>
<p>and then mature to the point</p>
<p>where they can be a really good swimmer.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that a bunch of sperm</p>
<p>are made on day one, and then 60 days later,</p>
<p>all those sperm are deployed in the form of ejaculate,</p>
<p>and then the cycle starts over again.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little different</p>
<p>than the ovulatory menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>Rather, at any given point in time,</p>
<p>like right now, if you have testes,</p>
<p>you have some sperm in your testes</p>
<p>that are immature and cannot swim,</p>
<p>cannot deliver those genetic contents</p>
<p>rather to the female egg,</p>
<p>and you have some sperm that are mature,</p>
<p>and you very likely have some sperm that are so mature</p>
<p>that they are dying off or that they&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>Almost certainly also, regardless of your age,</p>
<p>you have some sperm that are healthier than others,</p>
<p>are better swimmers than others.</p>
<p>This is just the way the system works.</p>
<p>Now, the process of spermatogenesis</p>
<p>involves a couple of things,</p>
<p>but a lot of the players are the same</p>
<p>as the process of developing the so-called oocyte,</p>
<p>the immature egg.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got GnRH from the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be a player.</p>
<p>We have FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone,</p>
<p>although the name&rsquo;s a little bit of a misnomer</p>
<p>in the context of spermatogenesis</p>
<p>because in the context of spermatogenesis,</p>
<p>there is no follicle.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re really talking about is FSH</p>
<p>for stimulating the maturation of the sperm cell,</p>
<p>so not egg follicle, but sperm cell,</p>
<p>but we still have GnRH, FSH, LH,</p>
<p>and rather than the ovary being the target</p>
<p>of those hormones, it&rsquo;s going to be the testes.</p>
<p>So most everybody should know that the testes</p>
<p>and the ovaries are the so-called gonads.</p>
<p>The testes, of course, reside outside of the body.</p>
<p>There are instances where the testes fail</p>
<p>to descend during development.</p>
<p>Certainly if the testes don&rsquo;t descend on time,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something that doctors need to be made aware of,</p>
<p>the pediatricians be made aware of</p>
<p>because that can prevent fertility.</p>
<p>Why would that be?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that the testes reside outside the body</p>
<p>in the scrotum because the temperature conditions</p>
<p>under which spermatogenesis can occur</p>
<p>and under which healthy sperm can be maintained</p>
<p>are very restricted and is approximately two degrees cooler</p>
<p>than the rest of the body.</p>
<p>This is very important.</p>
<p>You know, I think this is something</p>
<p>that used to be discussed a lot more,</p>
<p>but isn&rsquo;t discussed so much these days,</p>
<p>but keeping the testes cool enough</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean keeping them cold,</p>
<p>although there is a place for using cold exposure,</p>
<p>deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>to improve sperm quality and number,</p>
<p>and perhaps even testosterone levels.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about that a little bit later,</p>
<p>but keeping the testes about two degrees cooler</p>
<p>than the rest of the body is absolutely key.</p>
<p>If sperm get too hot, they die.</p>
<p>And if spermatocytes, the cells that give rise to sperm,</p>
<p>get too warm, well then oftentimes the sperm that develop</p>
<p>are not healthy, not healthy in a number of ways.</p>
<p>Either they can&rsquo;t engage in fast forward progression</p>
<p>and that is swimming, or they will lack the ability</p>
<p>to deposit their DNA contents within the egg.</p>
<p>So again, whatever is contained in the ejaculate</p>
<p>is going to be a mixture of different sperm qualities</p>
<p>and sperm of different ages will impact the quality,</p>
<p>but also the temperature under which those sperm developed</p>
<p>is going to impact their quality.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re going to get into tools a little bit later,</p>
<p>as I mentioned, but just to give you a simple takeaway,</p>
<p>if you are hoping to conceive in the next 90 days, right?</p>
<p>The spermatogenesis cycle takes 60 days,</p>
<p>but then the sperm actually have to migrate</p>
<p>from the testicle into the so-called epididymis,</p>
<p>which is a related structure,</p>
<p>and then into the vas deferens and then into the urethra,</p>
<p>where it can be part of the ejaculate.</p>
<p>In order for sperm to do all that properly,</p>
<p>undergo that maturation and then exit in ejaculate</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s healthy or that the sperm is healthy,</p>
<p>if you plan to conceive children</p>
<p>or to try and conceive children in the next 90 days,</p>
<p>you definitely want to avoid exposing your testicles,</p>
<p>that is your scrotum, to elevated temperatures.</p>
<p>So that means definitely avoiding hot tubs,</p>
<p>definitely avoiding hot baths.</p>
<p>Now, a brief hot bath or hot tub or hot shower</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t going to be a problem.</p>
<p>Although if you&rsquo;re really interested in conceiving,</p>
<p>I would avoid hot tubs and hot baths as much as possible.</p>
<p>Hot showers are probably fine.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re going to go into a sauna, for instance,</p>
<p>you might want to rethink that decision.</p>
<p>And if you do decide to,</p>
<p>you almost certainly would want to bring a cold pack</p>
<p>in that you could, well, hopefully put some material</p>
<p>between the cold pack and the scrotum</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t get a cold burn, but put something there,</p>
<p>but keep the scrotal tissue cool, keep it cold to cool,</p>
<p>because heat exposure can really mutate</p>
<p>and disrupt the developing sperm and it can kill sperm.</p>
<p>And so again, that would be for an entire 90 days</p>
<p>leading up to your attempts to conceive.</p>
<p>Again, we&rsquo;ll get into more tools later,</p>
<p>but a number of people also have probably heard</p>
<p>of the boxers versus briefs controversy, I guess it is,</p>
<p>or whether or not people call it going commando</p>
<p>with no underwear of any kind,</p>
<p>boxers, briefs, or otherwise, rather.</p>
<p>Turns out that the data on that point to the fact</p>
<p>that there isn&rsquo;t really a big difference</p>
<p>in terms of sperm quality.</p>
<p>If people wear boxers or briefs</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t wear anything under their jeans or shorts at all,</p>
<p>the scrotum has the ability to move the testicles</p>
<p>far enough away from the body</p>
<p>in order to achieve lower temperatures.</p>
<p>If it needs to, it achieves that through a muscle</p>
<p>called the Cremaster muscle,</p>
<p>which is a really interesting muscle, believe it or not.</p>
<p>I was reading up on the biology of the Cremaster muscle,</p>
<p>something I never thought I&rsquo;d spend too much time on,</p>
<p>but that I ended up spending far too much time</p>
<p>reading up about.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really fascinating.</p>
<p>What you have is a muscle that&rsquo;s a smooth muscle tissue,</p>
<p>unlike skeletal muscle, which is striated muscle,</p>
<p>that is temperature dependent.</p>
<p>So it has certain nerve endings</p>
<p>and it has certain receptors on it</p>
<p>that allow it to respond to local temperature</p>
<p>and then to relax in order to essentially</p>
<p>let the testicles to descend further from the body</p>
<p>or to contract and bring the testicles closer to the body</p>
<p>in order to try and maintain the optimal temperature range.</p>
<p>And it turns out the Cremaster muscle can achieve that</p>
<p>whether or not people are wearing boxers or briefs,</p>
<p>although it stands to reason that any kind of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no other name for it, undergarments,</p>
<p>you know, I don&rsquo;t know why that word</p>
<p>just seems kind of antiquated,</p>
<p>but undergarment that allows some movement</p>
<p>of the scrotum and the testicles</p>
<p>should be sufficient to allow these temperature</p>
<p>variations to occur and keep things in range.</p>
<p>That said, a little bit later,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll go into some detail really,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s important as to why, for instance,</p>
<p>if you are somebody who has big thighs, believe it or not,</p>
<p>that it actually can lower sperm count substantially,</p>
<p>whether or not the big thighs occur</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re very muscular,</p>
<p>or the big thighs occur because you are overweight,</p>
<p>it can increase the temperature.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re sitting a lot,</p>
<p>increases scrotal temperature for sure.</p>
<p>And there are some other things</p>
<p>that can increase scrotal temperature,</p>
<p>seat heaters in cars, for instance,</p>
<p>terrible idea, just terrible idea</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re hoping to conceive in the near future.</p>
<p>And again, hot tub, things of that sort.</p>
<p>Okay, so temperature modulation of spermatogenesis</p>
<p>and sperm quality and function is key.</p>
<p>That relates a little bit more to tools, but what happens?</p>
<p>How does the actual sperm develop?</p>
<p>Well, contained within the testicle,</p>
<p>you have the cells, the so-called spermatogonia,</p>
<p>which differentiate into so-called spermatocytes.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to remember all this.</p>
<p>And the spermatocytes undergo this process of meiosis.</p>
<p>Meiosis is a form of cell division,</p>
<p>which reduces the chromosome number</p>
<p>to those 23 individual strands as opposed to pairs, right?</p>
<p>So it makes them haploid as opposed to diploid.</p>
<p>Very, very important for reasons</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>And the meiosis process in these primordial sperm cells,</p>
<p>these immature sperm cells,</p>
<p>is similar to the meiosis process that occurs in eggs</p>
<p>when the chromosomes segregate,</p>
<p>in that it involves these spindle-like structures</p>
<p>within the cell.</p>
<p>Now, why do I keep bringing up the spindles?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that the function of the spindle</p>
<p>in the egg and the sperm is heavily dependent</p>
<p>on mitochondrial function.</p>
<p>And later when we get into tools</p>
<p>for improving egg and sperm quality,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to hear about a lot of tools</p>
<p>for improving mitochondria.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just because the mitochondria</p>
<p>are involved in energy-demanding aspects of cell biology,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also because the mitochondria in this context</p>
<p>are very, very important for the removal of,</p>
<p>or the separation of one set of chromosomes</p>
<p>to give you these two sets of haploid cells,</p>
<p>the egg and the sperm.</p>
<p>And this is so important</p>
<p>because many failures at fertilization,</p>
<p>many failures at implantation,</p>
<p>many, many miscarriages,</p>
<p>and many birth defects that do survive after birth</p>
<p>that are very detrimental,</p>
<p>such as trisomies and things like that,</p>
<p>occur because the spindles</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t effectively pull apart the chromosomes</p>
<p>in the, typically the egg,</p>
<p>but it can also occur in the sperm, okay?</p>
<p>So the spindles and the fact that mitochondria</p>
<p>are rich on the spindle</p>
<p>are very important for generating these haploid sperm,</p>
<p>again, 23 individual strands of chromosomes,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s occurring inside of the testes, okay?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not as much long-distance migration</p>
<p>of the spermatocytes and the sperm cells</p>
<p>as there is the egg,</p>
<p>just when you think about the overall architecture</p>
<p>of the uterus and the fallopian tubes</p>
<p>compared to the testicles,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still a lot of movement.</p>
<p>So within the testicle,</p>
<p>if you were to look at the testicle in cross-section,</p>
<p>and I prefer to call it that</p>
<p>rather than cut the testicle in half,</p>
<p>anytime you talk about anatomy,</p>
<p>you actually talk about slicing things,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you would do with a cadaver,</p>
<p>is what I teach and we do in my laboratory,</p>
<p>and frankly, in biological laboratories all over the place.</p>
<p>But when you talk about it,</p>
<p>you talk about if you were to take a visual cross-section</p>
<p>through the testicle,</p>
<p>what you would find</p>
<p>is that there are a lot of different little tubes,</p>
<p>a lot of ducts, D-U-C-T-S, ducts, those are pathways.</p>
<p>And the main ducts that are important for this discussion</p>
<p>are called the seminiferous tubules, okay?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a mesh-like or network structure of tubes</p>
<p>in the testicle,</p>
<p>and the immature sperm sit on a little compartment</p>
<p>along the edge of those tubes,</p>
<p>and as they mature,</p>
<p>they move towards the center of those tubes,</p>
<p>and then when they are mature enough,</p>
<p>those sperm cells actually drop into the hollow of the tube</p>
<p>and they can travel through those tubes</p>
<p>to a structure that&rsquo;s along the side of the testicle</p>
<p>called the epididymis.</p>
<p>The epididymis, again, is a series of ducts,</p>
<p>and then the epididymis converges</p>
<p>with something called the vas deferens, okay?</p>
<p>I think in high school,</p>
<p>we all remember this by thinking about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the vas deferens.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who came up with that.</p>
<p>I think it was a young girl sitting to the left of me</p>
<p>that was like, oh, it&rsquo;s like the vas deferens.</p>
<p>I never forgot that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe it was a topic matter.</p>
<p>Maybe it was her.</p>
<p>Maybe it was some combination of the two,</p>
<p>but in any case,</p>
<p>the sperm go from the seminiferous tubules</p>
<p>to the epididymis and then to the vas deferens,</p>
<p>and then are contained in the ejaculate</p>
<p>along with seminal fluid.</p>
<p>Now, the seminal fluid is the carrier fluid</p>
<p>for the sperm themselves.</p>
<p>This is important because it turns out</p>
<p>that a lot of the things that can both negatively</p>
<p>or positively impact the quality of the sperm</p>
<p>relates not just to the sperm cells themselves</p>
<p>and the temperature of the environment</p>
<p>that they were matured in,</p>
<p>but also to the semen quality.</p>
<p>For instance, if you are a heavy drinker,</p>
<p>if you are a smoker,</p>
<p>or if you are a regular user of cannabis,</p>
<p>especially if you smoke cannabis or vape cannabis,</p>
<p>you create a lot of reactive oxygen species</p>
<p>that disrupt the chemistry of the seminal fluid,</p>
<p>which disrupts the sperm cell.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a direct action always on the sperm cell itself,</p>
<p>although it can be.</p>
<p>So for instance, in the form of smoked tobacco or cannabis,</p>
<p>there are a lot of carcinogens and mutagens</p>
<p>that actually mutate the DNA,</p>
<p>can cause DNA fragmentation and debilitate sperm.</p>
<p>But there are also a lot of things created</p>
<p>by smoking in particular,</p>
<p>regardless of what&rsquo;s being smoked,</p>
<p>that can create elevated reactive oxygen species</p>
<p>and disrupt the seminal fluid</p>
<p>that the sperm are contained in</p>
<p>in the so-called ejaculate, the semen.</p>
<p>Now, this will also become a relevant conversation later</p>
<p>when we briefly talk about vasectomies.</p>
<p>Vasectomies are literally a cutting of the vas deferens,</p>
<p>which leads to a situation,</p>
<p>provided the surgery was done correctly,</p>
<p>where men can still achieve</p>
<p>all the other aspects of intercourse.</p>
<p>They can still achieve erection.</p>
<p>They can still achieve orgasm.</p>
<p>They can still ejaculate.</p>
<p>But when they ejaculate, the seminal fluid is released,</p>
<p>but there are no sperm contained within the seminal fluid.</p>
<p>And it turns out that vasectomies</p>
<p>are a very effective form of birth control.</p>
<p>And they always check to see if zero sperm</p>
<p>and confirm that zero sperm</p>
<p>are being released in the ejaculate.</p>
<p>They are reversible.</p>
<p>That is, vasectomies are reversible.</p>
<p>But not always.</p>
<p>There are a subset of cases where it&rsquo;s not reversible,</p>
<p>in which case, if people still want to have children,</p>
<p>you have to go in and actually surgically extract sperm</p>
<p>from the testicles.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a process in which the vas deferens is altered</p>
<p>or severed in a way that the sperm</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t actually exit the testicle.</p>
<p>They can get into the epididymis usually,</p>
<p>but not into the vas deferens and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve ever wondered what a vasectomy is,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what a vasectomy is.</p>
<p>And I mentioned vasectomy now</p>
<p>because it illustrates the difference</p>
<p>between the seminal fluid, the semen,</p>
<p>and the sperm that the semen contain.</p>
<p>Okay, so 60 days to generate the sperm,</p>
<p>another two weeks or so for the sperm to travel</p>
<p>through the various ducts to the point</p>
<p>where they can be contained in the ejaculate.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the sperm cells themselves.</p>
<p>The sperm cells, again, have these 23 pairs</p>
<p>of single-strand chromosomes, they&rsquo;re haploid.</p>
<p>They have either an X or a Y sex chromosome</p>
<p>as the 23rd so-called sex chromosome.</p>
<p>And as we all know, they have a head.</p>
<p>The head tends to be oval in most cases.</p>
<p>The head contains very important enzymes and proteins</p>
<p>that are designed to fuse with the much larger egg</p>
<p>and to actually take the membrane of the sperm cell</p>
<p>and combine to actually mesh with the egg cells membrane</p>
<p>and then deliver the genetic contents to the egg cell.</p>
<p>In other words, to fertilize the egg cell.</p>
<p>Now, just behind the head is a region</p>
<p>called the mid-region.</p>
<p>That mid-region is a slightly thickened region.</p>
<p>And here, of course, I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about healthy sperm cell morphology.</p>
<p>Morphology simply means shape.</p>
<p>A mid-region, that mid-region has a bunch</p>
<p>of things related to cell motility</p>
<p>and to the forward progression of the cells.</p>
<p>First of all, it is chock-a-block full of mitochondria.</p>
<p>In fact, if you were to look just behind the head</p>
<p>of the sperm, what you&rsquo;d see is that</p>
<p>it is completely surrounded by mitochondria.</p>
<p>There are mitochondria elsewhere in the cell,</p>
<p>but most of them are contained</p>
<p>in this mid-region compartment just behind</p>
<p>the head of the sperm.</p>
<p>And that thick region is where the tail movement</p>
<p>of the sperm, the flagellation back and forth</p>
<p>is actually generated from.</p>
<p>Much like if you were to hold a rope,</p>
<p>like a battle rope in the gym,</p>
<p>and you were to whip the battle rope,</p>
<p>the whip at the one end of the rope is what allows</p>
<p>for the, let&rsquo;s just call it what it is,</p>
<p>the curves in the rope, the oscillations,</p>
<p>the rising and falling of the rope</p>
<p>all the way out to the end, right?</p>
<p>It is the force of the whip right at that end</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re, with the battle rope you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>with your hand and then with the sperm</p>
<p>that is occurring just behind the head of the sperm</p>
<p>that is actually going to dictate how fast</p>
<p>and how well that sperm can swim.</p>
<p>And indeed the sperm has to swim very far.</p>
<p>How far?</p>
<p>Well, on a relative scale, and again,</p>
<p>these are estimations because they&rsquo;re going to be,</p>
<p>how should we say?</p>
<p>There will be differences in the distance</p>
<p>from the head of the penis and where the ejaculation occurs</p>
<p>to the cervix, depending on the relative size</p>
<p>of the vaginal canal and the penis that delivers</p>
<p>the ejaculate to the vaginal canal.</p>
<p>But once the sperm arrive at the cervix, okay,</p>
<p>which is at the back of the vaginal canal,</p>
<p>just at the opening to the uterus,</p>
<p>once the sperm arrive there,</p>
<p>the distance from the cervix to the egg,</p>
<p>of course will vary depending on where that egg is</p>
<p>in its ovulatory trajectory, its pathway,</p>
<p>but it is akin, if you scale for size,</p>
<p>to the distance between Los Angeles and San Francisco,</p>
<p>which is many, many hundreds of miles.</p>
<p>So those sperm have to swim very far.</p>
<p>Now, of course, if the sperm are delivered</p>
<p>in the vaginal canal somewhat further away,</p>
<p>they will have further to go.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re delivered right at the cervical opening,</p>
<p>they will have less far to go.</p>
<p>The very effective swimming sperm swim very fast.</p>
<p>So they are able to accomplish that distance</p>
<p>in just a few days.</p>
<p>And this relates to a discussion that we will get into</p>
<p>in a lot more detail later as to how often</p>
<p>couples should have intercourse</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re trying to conceive.</p>
<p>Many people might think, well, it&rsquo;s every day.</p>
<p>However, the more frequent the ejaculation,</p>
<p>the lower the concentration of sperm in each ejaculate.</p>
<p>So this is not a discussion about how often</p>
<p>to have intercourse depending to your preferences</p>
<p>for pleasure or bonding or whatever reason.</p>
<p>This is a discussion about how often to have intercourse</p>
<p>in order to optimize the probability</p>
<p>of fertilization of the egg.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some general rules that of course come to mind,</p>
<p>which is ejaculations close to ovulation,</p>
<p>both before, during, or sometimes after</p>
<p>are obviously advantageous.</p>
<p>But you will also hear OBGYNs and urologists</p>
<p>suggesting intercourse every other day</p>
<p>leading up to the day of ovulation,</p>
<p>starting about three to four days out</p>
<p>from the day of ovulation.</p>
<p>So we got a little bit sidetracked,</p>
<p>albeit I think appropriately so,</p>
<p>and focusing on fertilization.</p>
<p>But what we were talking about right up</p>
<p>into the point of that is the anatomy of the sperm itself,</p>
<p>which is the head, the mid region</p>
<p>that contains all those mitochondria, and then the tail.</p>
<p>Now, what we haven&rsquo;t discussed</p>
<p>is the actual generation of the sperm.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a male or if you&rsquo;re a female,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really important to understand</p>
<p>how spermatogenesis works.</p>
<p>Spermatogenesis works in much in the same way</p>
<p>that the generation and maturation of eggs work.</p>
<p>Although, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to occur ongoing throughout the cycle</p>
<p>of the male&rsquo;s life after puberty.</p>
<p>We already talked about puberty,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just cover this in two or three sentences</p>
<p>as it relates to males,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s essentially the same thing.</p>
<p>The hypothalamus, up until the point of puberty,</p>
<p>is providing suppression of the release</p>
<p>of gonadotropin-releasing hormone.</p>
<p>Then some biological clock,</p>
<p>which is still not clearly understood,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably not leptin coming from body fat.</p>
<p>Again, unlike in the female,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably not leptin coming from body fat,</p>
<p>but some other signal arrives to the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>removes that inhibition,</p>
<p>and GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone,</p>
<p>is now released onto the pituitary.</p>
<p>A bunch of hormones are deployed from the pituitary.</p>
<p>As a consequence, the two most important ones</p>
<p>for the context of this discussion</p>
<p>are follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone.</p>
<p>Follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone</p>
<p>travel to the testes,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to do two main things.</p>
<p>One, they&rsquo;re going to trigger the production of testosterone</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to trigger the production</p>
<p>of the sperm themselves.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to set in motion,</p>
<p>for essentially the rest of the life of the male,</p>
<p>the production of sperm.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to initiate the spermatogenesis cycle,</p>
<p>and that cycle is going to be ongoing</p>
<p>at various stages for different sperm</p>
<p>for the rest of the man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>This is very different than the triggering</p>
<p>of development of oocytes in eggs in females,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s an existing vault,</p>
<p>that vault can be depleted to the point of zero</p>
<p>where it can&rsquo;t occur again.</p>
<p>Men can generate sperm their entire lifetime.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s a diminishment of sperm production</p>
<p>in very, very late age, say 80s and 90s or 100s,</p>
<p>but believe it or not, there&rsquo;s still sperm being produced.</p>
<p>The quality of those sperm is another question.</p>
<p>So everything we&rsquo;re going to talk about now</p>
<p>is essentially puberty onward.</p>
<p>Okay, prior to that, testicles are present,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not generating sperm.</p>
<p>Ejaculation isn&rsquo;t possible, or if it is possible,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very unlikely and unusual,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not going to contain sperm.</p>
<p>Everything we&rsquo;re going to talk about now is puberty forward.</p>
<p>Okay, so puberty onward to the rest of life.</p>
<p>And luteinizing hormones secreted from the pituitary</p>
<p>acts on the testes and on a very specific cell type</p>
<p>in the testes called the Leydig cells or Leydig cells,</p>
<p>L-E-Y-D-I-G, the Leydig cells.</p>
<p>The Leydig cells of the testes</p>
<p>are what produce testosterone.</p>
<p>Testosterone is going to have two major effects,</p>
<p>and here I mean really major</p>
<p>because it has many, many hundreds of effects</p>
<p>on different tissues of the body.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s the definition of a hormone, really.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a substance that acts in an endocrine fashion.</p>
<p>It can act on the very tissue that generated it.</p>
<p>So for instance, testosterone made by the Leydig cells</p>
<p>within the testes will act on the testes,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ll talk about in a moment,</p>
<p>but it can also act on other tissues.</p>
<p>It can act on the pharynx and larynx and deepen the voice</p>
<p>as it does during puberty.</p>
<p>It can act on the hair follicles and generate facial hair.</p>
<p>It can act on the musculature</p>
<p>and generate protein synthesis</p>
<p>and development of muscle, bone, et cetera.</p>
<p>Okay, all the things we associate with puberty</p>
<p>and with testosterone typically.</p>
<p>Restricting the conversation to the effects of testosterone</p>
<p>on the testicle itself and on spermatogenesis,</p>
<p>the Leydig cells make testosterone.</p>
<p>And keep in mind that some of that testosterone</p>
<p>will travel elsewhere in the body and do its thing</p>
<p>for gene expression and the more acute effects</p>
<p>of testosterone on the brain included.</p>
<p>But the testosterone within the testes</p>
<p>is at extremely high concentration.</p>
<p>In fact, the concentration of intratesticular testosterone</p>
<p>is at least a hundred times higher</p>
<p>than the concentration of testosterone</p>
<p>anywhere else in the body,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s being secreted into the rest of the body.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because there are a number of different</p>
<p>so-called binding proteins and enzymes</p>
<p>that sequester the testosterone within the testes.</p>
<p>So the Leydig cells are making testosterone.</p>
<p>A lot of that testosterone is acting on</p>
<p>and is restricted to the testes.</p>
<p>And that turns out to be very important</p>
<p>because testosterone within the testes</p>
<p>acts in concert with a different biological program</p>
<p>that starts with FSH, follicle stimulating hormone,</p>
<p>that also travels to the testes</p>
<p>and acts on a very specific set of cells</p>
<p>that are called supporting cells</p>
<p>or more specifically the Sertoli cells.</p>
<p>The Sertoli cells are the cells that generate</p>
<p>something called ABP or androgen binding protein.</p>
<p>And it is the combination of testosterone</p>
<p>from the Leydig cells and ABP from the Sertoli cells</p>
<p>that is necessary for spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s necessary for those spermatocytes</p>
<p>to become what will eventually be healthy, mature sperm</p>
<p>that have really nice shaped oval heads,</p>
<p>have a mid-region chock-a-block through mitochondria</p>
<p>and can generate a fast whipping motion of the tail</p>
<p>to swim from the cervix or up the vagina to the cervix</p>
<p>and from the cervix to the egg to fertilize the egg.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really a basic set of chemical players</p>
<p>that are involved here.</p>
<p>And so basic in fact that if you were to disrupt</p>
<p>any one of these chemical players,</p>
<p>either the luteinizing hormone, the FSH,</p>
<p>the testosterone from the Leydig cells</p>
<p>or androgen binding protein,</p>
<p>you would observe pretty marked disruption</p>
<p>in spermatogenesis or the elimination of sperm entirely.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get into a few deficits in sperm development</p>
<p>and sperm number and sperm function a little bit later,</p>
<p>but just keep in mind where I should say,</p>
<p>maybe sit back and just appreciate</p>
<p>that the exact same players, GnRH from the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>which causes luteinizing hormone</p>
<p>and follicle-stimulated hormone release from the pituitary,</p>
<p>which travels to the gonad,</p>
<p>which in this case is the testicle,</p>
<p>which triggers the release of testosterone</p>
<p>from Leydig cells,</p>
<p>which triggers the action of the supporting cells,</p>
<p>the Sertoli cells, which make androgen binding protein,</p>
<p>testosterone and androgen binding protein combine</p>
<p>and create a chemical and actually a structural milieu</p>
<p>in which those little spermatocytes can go from the walls,</p>
<p>from literally the walls of the tubes</p>
<p>of the seminiferous tubules,</p>
<p>can mature into healthy, well-developed sperm</p>
<p>and can hop into those ducts, those little tubes,</p>
<p>and then head off to the epididymis where they will reside.</p>
<p>The epididymis is the tissue nearby the testicle</p>
<p>or surrounding one portion of the testicle,</p>
<p>and then eventually fuse with the vas deferens,</p>
<p>can combine with or be contained with, rather,</p>
<p>the seminal fluid and then can be ejaculated</p>
<p>via the urethra into the female,</p>
<p>where then they can swim very quickly,</p>
<p>effectively the distance for them anyway,</p>
<p>from Los Angeles to San Francisco</p>
<p>over the course of a very short period of time</p>
<p>and fertilize the egg.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the process of spermatogenesis,</p>
<p>the maturation of sperm,</p>
<p>which is ongoing throughout the lifespan</p>
<p>from puberty onward.</p>
<p>And in doing so,</p>
<p>we talked about some of the hormonal elements</p>
<p>coming from the hypothalamus and coming from the pituitary</p>
<p>and within the testes themselves,</p>
<p>the Leydig cells, which produce testosterone,</p>
<p>the Sertoli cells, which are the support cells</p>
<p>that allow spermatogenesis to occur.</p>
<p>With that in mind,</p>
<p>next, I&rsquo;d like to think about</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s actually contained in the ejaculate</p>
<p>in terms of numbers of sperm</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s really being selected for</p>
<p>in terms of the sperm</p>
<p>that actually successfully fertilizes the egg</p>
<p>and what sorts of elements come into play</p>
<p>in dictating whether or not fertilization</p>
<p>will or won&rsquo;t occur.</p>
<p>And the major themes that we&rsquo;re going to discuss</p>
<p>are frequency of ejaculation,</p>
<p>but really that&rsquo;s just kind of a proxy</p>
<p>for talking about maximizing sperm concentration</p>
<p>and quality of sperm arriving at the egg, right?</p>
<p>Because remember, ovulation and the menstrual cycle</p>
<p>are really about creating</p>
<p>the opportunity for fertilization, okay?</p>
<p>And we are also going to talk about</p>
<p>how the vaginal duct, the vagina,</p>
<p>and the milieu around the cervix</p>
<p>and some other elements within the female herself</p>
<p>contribute to and support the sperm</p>
<p>in their journey to the egg</p>
<p>and in the likelihood that they will fertilize the egg.</p>
<p>So really what we need to talk about first is sperm quality.</p>
<p>And we should also probably talk about ejaculate quality</p>
<p>because as odd as that theme might seem,</p>
<p>really the ejaculate quality,</p>
<p>which has a number of different parameters,</p>
<p>including the number of mature sperm</p>
<p>that are not so mature that they&rsquo;re swimming slower or dead,</p>
<p>but also quality sperm that have, for instance, one tail.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not entirely uncommon to see sperm with two tails,</p>
<p>right, because they just didn&rsquo;t form properly,</p>
<p>or sperm that are not moving very much.</p>
<p>In fact, sperm motility is scored</p>
<p>along a scale of zero, one, two, or three,</p>
<p>three being the best for fast forward progressing,</p>
<p>a zero is not moving at all.</p>
<p>One, they&rsquo;re actually called twitchers, right?</p>
<p>Twitchers are sperm that are just twitch in place,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t undergo forward progression.</p>
<p>Two is somewhere in between one and three, not surprisingly.</p>
<p>Different clinics, different OBGYNs,</p>
<p>different urologists will throw out different numbers,</p>
<p>but in general, it is hoped that more than 50%</p>
<p>of the sperm should be motile in some way or another.</p>
<p>So not scoring a zero, but a one, a two, or ideally a three.</p>
<p>The concentration of sperm, of course,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s higher within the ejaculate,</p>
<p>the total number of sperm per milliliter of ejaculate,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s higher, then there&rsquo;s a higher probability</p>
<p>that one of those sperm will fertilize the egg.</p>
<p>One thing I didn&rsquo;t mention before</p>
<p>when discussing the production of eggs and ovulation,</p>
<p>and I probably should have, so I will now,</p>
<p>is that most often only one ovary</p>
<p>gives rise to an ovulating egg, right?</p>
<p>It happens, but it&rsquo;s somewhat rare for two mature eggs</p>
<p>one from each ovary to be deployed</p>
<p>during a single ovulation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a name for that when it occurs</p>
<p>and both are fertilized, it&rsquo;s called fraternal twins.</p>
<p>If a single egg, that of course comes from a single ovary,</p>
<p>is fertilized and the egg splits,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s something that happens further along the process</p>
<p>of fertilization and differentiation of the embryo,</p>
<p>well, then what you get are identical twins, okay?</p>
<p>There are other instances that are quite uncommon</p>
<p>in which you can get fraternal twins</p>
<p>through other circumstances,</p>
<p>but in general, that&rsquo;s the way it works.</p>
<p>But essentially what happens is one egg from one ovary,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the most common occurrence.</p>
<p>The sperm, once ejaculated into the vaginal duct,</p>
<p>are going to pass through the cervix</p>
<p>and then are going to swim toward the egg.</p>
<p>The egg could be at varying locations</p>
<p>along the female reproductive axis.</p>
<p>Now, this is actually a very important thing</p>
<p>and actually gets right down to the safety</p>
<p>of both the potentially developing embryo and the mother.</p>
<p>There is something I refer to as ectopic pregnancy,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when the pregnancy actually occurs</p>
<p>within the fallopian tubes.</p>
<p>So the precise location in which fertilization</p>
<p>between the sperm and the egg occurs can vary somewhat,</p>
<p>but ideally, the fertilized egg implants</p>
<p>into the endometrium or the endometrial lining</p>
<p>of the uterus and develops there</p>
<p>as opposed to within the fallopian tubes,</p>
<p>which is so-called ectopic pregnancy.</p>
<p>Now, where the sperm and the egg meet exactly can vary,</p>
<p>as I mentioned before, but in general,</p>
<p>the faster swimming sperm</p>
<p>and the more far along the ovulatory trajectory the egg are,</p>
<p>the higher the probability of a successful fertilization</p>
<p>because of the proximity</p>
<p>to the implantation zone of the uterus.</p>
<p>So basically it&rsquo;s all a probabilities game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a probabilities game related to the number</p>
<p>of sperm cells that encounter the egg</p>
<p>and where the egg is in terms of its ovulatory cycle.</p>
<p>And also its position where it is in the ovulatory cycle.</p>
<p>The sperm parameters, I should say,</p>
<p>the semen parameters and ejaculate parameters</p>
<p>that most clinicians want to see</p>
<p>if you were to give a sperm sample</p>
<p>would be somewhere in excess of 15 million sperm</p>
<p>per milliliter of ejaculate.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a lot of discussion nowadays.</p>
<p>It seems to be a very popular news theme</p>
<p>to talk about diminishing sperm counts.</p>
<p>The idea that a hundred years ago,</p>
<p>or maybe even 35 years ago,</p>
<p>the typical male ejaculate contained</p>
<p>a hundred million sperm per milliliter.</p>
<p>And nowadays it&rsquo;s down to 15 to 20 or 50.</p>
<p>And indeed sperm counts do seem to be declining.</p>
<p>And the exact reasons for that are not clear.</p>
<p>And I confess I&rsquo;m a little bit reluctant to talk about this</p>
<p>because there have been a lot of back and forth discussions</p>
<p>about the safety of EMFs of electromagnetic fields.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not exactly what we&rsquo;re talking about here,</p>
<p>but there are some excellent data contained</p>
<p>in meta-analysis and reviews that I will provide links to,</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;ll talk about in more detail in a minute,</p>
<p>that correlate the advent of smartphones,</p>
<p>and in particular, caring of smartphones in the pocket</p>
<p>with diminishing sperm counts.</p>
<p>Although there are certain to be other factors</p>
<p>that can explain diminishing sperm counts as well.</p>
<p>Dr. Shana Swan, for instance, has done beautiful work</p>
<p>describing how the phthalates and the BPAs</p>
<p>and so-called endocrine disruptors</p>
<p>might be disrupting some of the milieu</p>
<p>of the seminiferous tubules.</p>
<p>So this would be reductions in testosterone</p>
<p>and or disruptions to the Sertoli cells</p>
<p>and androgen binding protein brought about</p>
<p>by endocrine disruptors, such as phthalates</p>
<p>contained in pesticides and contained on printed receipts</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>There are some data</p>
<p>that that is negatively impacting sperm counts.</p>
<p>How much so is still debatable.</p>
<p>There are also quite good data pointing to the fact</p>
<p>that both the heat-related and the non-heat-related impact</p>
<p>of smartphones and laptops contained on the lap</p>
<p>are impacting sperm counts in a negative way.</p>
<p>Again, there&rsquo;s going to be tremendous variation</p>
<p>in the concentration of sperm</p>
<p>from one individual to the next.</p>
<p>It will vary according to age</p>
<p>and a number of other factors</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll talk about a little bit later.</p>
<p>But in general, if somebody is wishing to conceive,</p>
<p>then clinicians like to see a ejaculate volume</p>
<p>of more than two milliliters.</p>
<p>So ejaculate volume can be anywhere from 1.5</p>
<p>to five milliliters.</p>
<p>And that will strongly be determined</p>
<p>by how frequent ejaculation is occurring.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot that goes into evaluating</p>
<p>the quality of ejaculate in sperm,</p>
<p>but basically these huge variations that are observed</p>
<p>of anywhere from 15 million sperm per milliliter</p>
<p>or in some males who are not producing sperm</p>
<p>for whatever reason,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about those reasons in a little bit,</p>
<p>as low as 5 million sperm per milliliter,</p>
<p>all the way up to 100</p>
<p>or maybe even 200 million sperm per milliliter.</p>
<p>Huge variation.</p>
<p>The cause of which is not always clear,</p>
<p>but is certainly determined in part</p>
<p>by the frequency of ejaculation.</p>
<p>So because there are so many variables impacting</p>
<p>why one male versus another male</p>
<p>or even the same male across the lifespan</p>
<p>might have variations in his concentration of sperm</p>
<p>within the ejaculate.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk for a second about frequency of ejaculation</p>
<p>as it relates to the goal of fertility per se,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really what today&rsquo;s episode is all about.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;d like to talk about next</p>
<p>is how people can increase the probability</p>
<p>of a successful fertilization,</p>
<p>focusing both on the components from the male side</p>
<p>and from the female side.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m mainly going to couch this discussion</p>
<p>in the context of the so-called natural method</p>
<p>of sexual intercourse and ejaculation in vivo, right?</p>
<p>Within the female,</p>
<p>but I will also touch on some parallel themes</p>
<p>as it relates to in vitro fertilization</p>
<p>and intrauterine insemination, okay?</p>
<p>So the idea here is that we want the maximum number</p>
<p>of high quality sperm,</p>
<p>that is rapidly forward motile sperm</p>
<p>that are of the correct morphology, that is shape.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to require a lot of mitochondria</p>
<p>in the mid region, a well-shaped head.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to be an oval shaped head.</p>
<p>The tail is going to be a single tail, not multiple tails.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t going to be the twitcher type of,</p>
<p>or immotile type of sperm</p>
<p>that are either twitching in place or aren&rsquo;t moving forward.</p>
<p>All of those components are going to be essential</p>
<p>for increasing the probability of fertilization.</p>
<p>But of course there&rsquo;s the female side of it too,</p>
<p>which is that ovulation occurs on just one day</p>
<p>during the menstrual ovulatory cycle.</p>
<p>And that egg will be available for fertilization</p>
<p>for approximately 24 hours.</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind that the sperm can survive</p>
<p>within the vaginal duct</p>
<p>and within the area around the cervix</p>
<p>and within the uterus</p>
<p>and along the female reproductive tract</p>
<p>for anywhere from three to five,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s even been described as up to seven days,</p>
<p>but generally it&rsquo;s going to be about three to five days.</p>
<p>Now, most women can figure out the day of their ovulation</p>
<p>by counting the total number of days of their typical cycle.</p>
<p>And this is where it&rsquo;s really useful to have a cycle</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s of more or less regular duration,</p>
<p>or rather of more or less regular length.</p>
<p>So as we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>if somebody&rsquo;s cycle is 21 days or 25 days,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s 21 or 25 days consistently,</p>
<p>or even 30 days consistently,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be a far better scenario</p>
<p>to favor fertilization than if it&rsquo;s 20 days, one month,</p>
<p>and then 21 days the next month,</p>
<p>but then suddenly, you know, 30 days,</p>
<p>and then suddenly 35 days.</p>
<p>Those varying durations of the ovulatory cycle</p>
<p>make it very hard, obviously,</p>
<p>to time and understand when ovulation is going to occur.</p>
<p>So regular duration ovulatory cycles</p>
<p>are the ideal circumstance,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re the ideal circumstance</p>
<p>because even though the egg is only available</p>
<p>for fertilization for a few days,</p>
<p>those sperm can survive for some period of time,</p>
<p>which leads to the issue</p>
<p>of how often should couples be having intercourse,</p>
<p>and here I&rsquo;m referring specifically</p>
<p>to intercourse with ejaculation,</p>
<p>how often should couples be having intercourse</p>
<p>around the time of ovulation</p>
<p>if the specific goal is successful fertilization of the egg</p>
<p>and the creation of a baby, okay?</p>
<p>This is leaving aside all issues,</p>
<p>which of course are interesting issues</p>
<p>related to how often people are having intercourse,</p>
<p>whether or not there&rsquo;s ejaculation</p>
<p>every time they have intercourse or not</p>
<p>for sake of pleasure or for sake of pair bonding and pleasure</p>
<p>or for sake of any number of other</p>
<p>potential goals of intercourse.</p>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;m only referring to intercourse</p>
<p>as it relates to the goal of fertilization of the egg, okay?</p>
<p>So knowing what we know about spermatogenesis</p>
<p>and the fact that ejaculate is going to contain</p>
<p>a certain concentration of sperm,</p>
<p>but that within that ejaculate,</p>
<p>some of the sperm will be older and less healthy</p>
<p>and some will be optimally mature</p>
<p>and some might even be a little bit immature,</p>
<p>although there&rsquo;s a tendency for the immature sperm</p>
<p>to not have yet exited the seminiferous tubules,</p>
<p>gone into the epididymis and vas deferens.</p>
<p>But given that the ejaculate contains sperm of varying ages</p>
<p>and therefore varying quality,</p>
<p>and given that with each successive ejaculation</p>
<p>in a short period of time,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be a decrease</p>
<p>in the concentration of sperm per milliliter</p>
<p>of semen of ejaculate,</p>
<p>we can make some good arguments</p>
<p>as to how often couples should have intercourse</p>
<p>with ejaculation around the time of ovulation</p>
<p>if the goal is to fertilize.</p>
<p>If ovulation occurs on, for instance, day 14 of a cycle,</p>
<p>and here we&rsquo;re using the kind of standard average</p>
<p>of 28 days of the cycle,</p>
<p>but for some people with a 30-day cycle,</p>
<p>you know, that could be day 15,</p>
<p>or with a shorter cycle, it could be day 12, for instance.</p>
<p>But given a 28-day average cycle,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say ovulation occurs on day 13 or on day 14,</p>
<p>and typically would occur on day 14 of a 28-day cycle.</p>
<p>Well then, given how long sperm can survive</p>
<p>inside of the woman,</p>
<p>you might think that the optimal strategy</p>
<p>would be to have as much intercourse with ejaculation</p>
<p>in the three or four days leading up to ovulation,</p>
<p>hope that those sperm swim as far as they possibly can,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll encounter the egg</p>
<p>just as soon as possible after it ovulates.</p>
<p>It turns out that&rsquo;s not the optimal strategy.</p>
<p>The optimal strategy is really to maximize</p>
<p>the concentration of healthy sperm within each ejaculate,</p>
<p>and to really center that around the day of ovulation.</p>
<p>So what this involves generally,</p>
<p>and what the typical recommendation is,</p>
<p>is to abstain from intercourse with ejaculation</p>
<p>about two or three days out from ovulation,</p>
<p>and then on the day prior to ovulation</p>
<p>and on the day of ovulation,</p>
<p>to essentially introduce as much semen and ejaculate</p>
<p>into the reproductive pathway of the female as possible.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s the general recommendation</p>
<p>that the OBGYNs and the urologists that I spoke to gave,</p>
<p>but you will also hear a different strategy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only slightly different,</p>
<p>but the different strategy involves</p>
<p>trying to maximize the concentration of healthy sperm</p>
<p>within each ejaculate with the understanding</p>
<p>that with each subsequent ejaculation</p>
<p>over about a 24-hour period,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s going to be a dramatic reduction</p>
<p>in the concentration of sperm.</p>
<p>What that means is that if a couple, for instance,</p>
<p>were to have intercourse with ejaculation</p>
<p>many times on the day prior to ovulation,</p>
<p>yes, that will introduce a lot of sperm</p>
<p>into the reproductive pathway of the female,</p>
<p>but what it means is that on the day of ovulation,</p>
<p>if they were to have intercourse,</p>
<p>the number of high-quality sperm</p>
<p>that will be available to the egg</p>
<p>will be greatly diminished,</p>
<p>and if none of the sperm that were introduced</p>
<p>in the day prior managed to fertilize that egg,</p>
<p>well then, essentially, chances are off</p>
<p>that there will be fertilization</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re greatly diminished.</p>
<p>Rather, if they&rsquo;re having intercourse with ejaculation</p>
<p>once or twice on the day prior to ovulation</p>
<p>and then a maximal number of times with ejaculation</p>
<p>on the day of ovulation,</p>
<p>that itself can maximize the probability of fertilization.</p>
<p>So which strategy is optimal?</p>
<p>Should couples have as much intercourse with ejaculation</p>
<p>on the day prior to ovulation and on the day of ovulation,</p>
<p>or should they have intercourse</p>
<p>on the day prior to ovulation,</p>
<p>but not so frequently</p>
<p>that it diminishes the concentration of sperm</p>
<p>and then allows for intercourse</p>
<p>with the maximum number of ejaculations</p>
<p>on the day of ovulation?</p>
<p>You really hear it both ways.</p>
<p>And what this really boils down to</p>
<p>is, frankly, that nobody knows.</p>
<p>And the reason nobody knows</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s tremendous variation among males</p>
<p>in terms of the absolute concentration</p>
<p>of sperm per milliliter of ejaculate</p>
<p>and the amount of sperm per milliliter of ejaculate</p>
<p>within a given timeframe.</p>
<p>But what everyone agrees on</p>
<p>is that a period of abstinence</p>
<p>ranging from 48 to 72 hours prior to an ejaculation</p>
<p>increases the concentration of high quality sperm</p>
<p>within that first ejaculation to occur</p>
<p>after the abstinence period, okay?</p>
<p>So again, to reiterate,</p>
<p>if one&rsquo;s goal is to fertilize the egg,</p>
<p>you want to take into consideration</p>
<p>that most often there&rsquo;s going to be a dramatic decline</p>
<p>in the concentration of sperm per ejaculate</p>
<p>anytime those ejaculations are occurring</p>
<p>within a short period of time,</p>
<p>say within 12 to 24 hours of one another.</p>
<p>Now, all of this, of course,</p>
<p>also relates to the female biology</p>
<p>and the extent to which the woman can precisely identify</p>
<p>the day and timing of her ovulation.</p>
<p>Some women feel as if, and indeed are very accurate</p>
<p>at estimating their time of ovulation</p>
<p>to within a couple of hours,</p>
<p>or some women even report being able to feel</p>
<p>their actual ovulation,</p>
<p>whether or not they are feeling the ovulation itself,</p>
<p>the deployment of the egg or not isn&rsquo;t clear.</p>
<p>I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never produced eggs nor have I ovulated,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m certainly not going to contest the idea</p>
<p>that women can do that.</p>
<p>I mean, it makes sense that some people</p>
<p>have a very keen so-called interoceptive awareness,</p>
<p>an awareness of the sensory events within their body.</p>
<p>And while, of course, the ovaries are not thought of</p>
<p>as an organ that we want to be able to sense</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on in there in terms of feel,</p>
<p>there are sensory endings within the ovary.</p>
<p>And so the notion that one could literally sense</p>
<p>changes within their ovary,</p>
<p>including the deployment of the egg</p>
<p>is not outside the bounds of reason.</p>
<p>And in fact, could likely be the case.</p>
<p>Now, that said, there are a number of different ways</p>
<p>that women will track their ovulation.</p>
<p>One is the temperature method.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll actually measure intravaginal temperature.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking for changes in temperature</p>
<p>that are consistent around the time of ovulation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have an expert guest on an OBGYN</p>
<p>who can tell us a lot more about the details</p>
<p>and the nuances of the temperature method.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see a lot of information about this online,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of misunderstanding about it as well.</p>
<p>Other women will use apps that take into account</p>
<p>either the temperature information,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re acquiring temperature information,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll be entered into the app,</p>
<p>as well as marking the onset of menstruation,</p>
<p>the onset of bleeding,</p>
<p>therefore the start of the ovulatory cycle.</p>
<p>Because of course, as we mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>that marks day one of their cycle.</p>
<p>And then again and again,</p>
<p>you can see how regularity of cycle duration</p>
<p>or relative regularity of cycle duration</p>
<p>really favors this whole process</p>
<p>of being able to predict when one ovulates.</p>
<p>And fortunately, if the goal is fertilization,</p>
<p>there are some margins for error</p>
<p>that are introduced by the fact</p>
<p>that the sperm can survive</p>
<p>within the female reproductive tract</p>
<p>for some period of days,</p>
<p>thereby reducing the need for absolute certainty</p>
<p>about the time of ovulation and so on.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s pretty well known</p>
<p>that around the time of ovulation,</p>
<p>a couple of things happen.</p>
<p>Earlier, we talked about one thing,</p>
<p>which is there&rsquo;s an increase in libido</p>
<p>just prior to ovulation.</p>
<p>This relates to in part,</p>
<p>an increase in some of the androgens,</p>
<p>things like DHEA, but also testosterone</p>
<p>and some related androgens that can increase libido,</p>
<p>both in males and females.</p>
<p>And changes to the reproductive pathway of the female,</p>
<p>in particular, a change in the pH,</p>
<p>that is the relative acidity versus basic nature</p>
<p>of the mucosal lining near the cervix</p>
<p>and also vaginal secretions,</p>
<p>such that around the time of ovulation,</p>
<p>the entire milieu of the vagina and the cervix</p>
<p>and the locations in which fertilization can occur</p>
<p>and certainly in which the sperm</p>
<p>are swimming towards the opportunity for fertilization</p>
<p>is shifted to support sperm motility and health.</p>
<p>In other words, one of the best environments</p>
<p>for sperm to survive</p>
<p>is going to be within</p>
<p>the female reproductive pathway itself.</p>
<p>And as long as we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>vaginal secretions and mucus,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to point out</p>
<p>that a number of commercially available lubricants</p>
<p>can actually be detrimental for sperm health,</p>
<p>even if they don&rsquo;t contain spermaticide.</p>
<p>So this is something that you&rsquo;ll want to discuss</p>
<p>with your OB-GYN or certainly if you&rsquo;re male,</p>
<p>you could also discuss this with your urologist</p>
<p>and your partner&rsquo;s OB-GYN.</p>
<p>A lot of the commercially available lubricants</p>
<p>contain chemicals that while they may favorably</p>
<p>change the consistency or the viscosity</p>
<p>of the vaginal pathway for purposes of intercourse,</p>
<p>certainly may not be the most favorable</p>
<p>for maintaining the health of the sperm</p>
<p>and the motility of the sperm.</p>
<p>So again, here we&rsquo;re talking about intercourse</p>
<p>only in the context of trying to maximize fertilization.</p>
<p>And I should mention that there are certain lubricants</p>
<p>that are more conducive to the sperm environment,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something that you&rsquo;ll really want to talk</p>
<p>to your OB-GYN about, or at least read up about</p>
<p>if your interest is in trying to fertilize</p>
<p>and develop an embryo.</p>
<p>So we covered the optimal strategies</p>
<p>for how often couples should have intercourse</p>
<p>with ejaculation around the time of ovulation</p>
<p>in order to maximize the probability</p>
<p>that successful fertilization</p>
<p>and ultimately pregnancy will occur.</p>
<p>What we haven&rsquo;t covered yet, however,</p>
<p>is how long couples should apply that method over time</p>
<p>in order to achieve successful fertilization and pregnancy.</p>
<p>Now, of course, if a couple decides</p>
<p>that they want to conceive and they apply that method</p>
<p>or any other method, for instance,</p>
<p>and they achieve fertilization and a successful pregnancy</p>
<p>the very first month that they try,</p>
<p>well then there&rsquo;s no other work to do,</p>
<p>at least until that child is born.</p>
<p>And if and only if they decide</p>
<p>they want to have more children.</p>
<p>However, many couples find that they do not conceive</p>
<p>in the first month of trying,</p>
<p>even when they apply the optimal methods</p>
<p>and even if their age and every other factor</p>
<p>related to egg quality and sperm quality is optimized.</p>
<p>Now, I think it&rsquo;s the rare instance</p>
<p>in which egg quality and sperm quality are optimized.</p>
<p>In fact, the word optimal and optimization and optimized</p>
<p>is a little bit misleading in general</p>
<p>because no one really knows what that is.</p>
<p>But of course there is an ideal,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a perfect standard</p>
<p>to which everyone would like to achieve.</p>
<p>But of course, we all enter the picture</p>
<p>with genetic variables, environmental variables,</p>
<p>and so forth, many of which we&rsquo;ll talk about</p>
<p>because you can in fact adjust them</p>
<p>in the direction that you would like</p>
<p>to improve sperm and egg quality.</p>
<p>But most people simply will not succeed</p>
<p>in achieving a successful fertilization</p>
<p>the first month that they try.</p>
<p>Now, there is a truth that governs</p>
<p>how many tries it ought to take</p>
<p>in order to achieve successful fertilization</p>
<p>and ultimately pregnancy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very age dependent.</p>
<p>And in particular, it&rsquo;s dependent on the age of the mother</p>
<p>because the age and quality of the egg,</p>
<p>while it&rsquo;s not the only factor,</p>
<p>is certainly one of the most determining factors</p>
<p>in whether or not successful fertilization occurs.</p>
<p>And as women age, the quality of the eggs</p>
<p>tends to diminish over time,</p>
<p>largely due to changes in the mitochondrial function</p>
<p>and the spindle that pulls the chromosomes apart,</p>
<p>although there could be other factors involved as well.</p>
<p>Now, before continuing any further,</p>
<p>I just want to acknowledge that this whole language</p>
<p>around egg quality and sperm quality</p>
<p>is not the greatest language</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s entirely subjective.</p>
<p>And yet the word quality in these instances</p>
<p>is really there to explain a broad variety of factors</p>
<p>that can in fact be measured.</p>
<p>Things like the number of follicles</p>
<p>that are deployed each month in a woman&rsquo;s ovulation</p>
<p>or the number of motile sperm</p>
<p>or the number of morphologically,</p>
<p>that is correctly shaped sperm in the male and so forth.</p>
<p>So when we talk about egg quality or sperm quality,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re really referring to an amalgam of different features</p>
<p>related to the different aspects of ovulation</p>
<p>leading to successful fertilization</p>
<p>or the different aspects of sperm</p>
<p>related to whether or not they can arrive</p>
<p>and deliver their DNA contents and so forth.</p>
<p>So I will use the words egg quality and sperm quality</p>
<p>just as general themes</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what a lot of the clinicians use.</p>
<p>But I do understand that it&rsquo;s a little bit of a loaded term</p>
<p>in both instances,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t relate to any one specific parameter per se.</p>
<p>So getting back to this issue of how long couples should try</p>
<p>according to the age of the female</p>
<p>and perhaps also the age of the male.</p>
<p>Well, most of the data that have been collected</p>
<p>relate to the age of the females I mentioned before.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;re about to discuss</p>
<p>is within the scientific literature</p>
<p>described as what&rsquo;s called fecundability,</p>
<p>which is the amount of time over which a given couple</p>
<p>needs to attempt to conceive,</p>
<p>of course, by having intercourse with ejaculation</p>
<p>around the time of ovulation.</p>
<p>Okay, it assumes that all the other things</p>
<p>are being done correctly.</p>
<p>And what we know</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a strong age-dependent effect</p>
<p>that largely rests on the age of the egg,</p>
<p>that is of the female.</p>
<p>And what we know is that for females 30 years old or younger,</p>
<p>if they have intercourse with ejaculation</p>
<p>around the time of ovulation,</p>
<p>say on the day before and on the day of ovulation,</p>
<p>and there could be other intercourse with ejaculation</p>
<p>around that time as well,</p>
<p>on average, that will result</p>
<p>in a successful fertilization in pregnancy</p>
<p>about 20% of the time on the first month of attempting,</p>
<p>the first ovulation cycle.</p>
<p>Now, if fertilization in pregnancy occurs, great, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be at least a nine-month lag</p>
<p>until they decide whether or not</p>
<p>they want to try and conceive again.</p>
<p>However, most couples,</p>
<p>even if the woman is 30 years old or younger,</p>
<p>will not successfully conceive on that first attempt.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the probability is not 100%, it&rsquo;s 20%.</p>
<p>So 80% of the time, they simply will not conceive.</p>
<p>Which means that they hopefully will try again</p>
<p>the very next month.</p>
<p>And if they successfully conceive, great.</p>
<p>And if they don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>then they ought to try again the next month,</p>
<p>the next month, and so forth.</p>
<p>Now, the typical advice that an OBGYN would give you</p>
<p>is that for a woman 30 years or younger,</p>
<p>and leaving aside the age of the father,</p>
<p>but still assuming that egg quality and sperm quality</p>
<p>are sufficiently high to achieve fertilization,</p>
<p>that the couple should,</p>
<p>or if the woman&rsquo;s trying to have kids alone,</p>
<p>the woman should attempt to conceive</p>
<p>over the period of six months.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, if you think about it,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a 20% chance in the first month,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s unsuccessful,</p>
<p>well, then on the second month,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll also be a 20% chance.</p>
<p>On the third month, also a 20% chance.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m describing here</p>
<p>is what obviously is independent probabilities.</p>
<p>That is, if you were to flip a coin</p>
<p>and the probability of getting heads is 50%,</p>
<p>the probability of getting tails is 50%, of course,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t expect that the previous flip</p>
<p>had anything to do with the result</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll get on the subsequent flip.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what independent probabilities are.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to fecundability,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re really talking about something</p>
<p>which is called cumulative pregnancy rate,</p>
<p>which is not really independent probabilities.</p>
<p>Now, why would that be?</p>
<p>Why would it be that if you did not successfully conceive</p>
<p>in the first month of trying,</p>
<p>that by simply trying again and again and again,</p>
<p>the probability of conceiving would increase?</p>
<p>Well, the reason for that</p>
<p>is that this whole business of fertilization</p>
<p>is not just about what&rsquo;s happening with the egg,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also about what&rsquo;s happening with the sperm.</p>
<p>So there are a number of different events</p>
<p>related to the biology of the egg</p>
<p>and the biology of the sperm,</p>
<p>which you are now very familiar with</p>
<p>from everything I&rsquo;ve talked about up until now.</p>
<p>And there are a bunch of chance events,</p>
<p>for instance, that the sperm won&rsquo;t actually arrive</p>
<p>at the egg in time,</p>
<p>or that the egg won&rsquo;t arrive at the sperm in time,</p>
<p>because of course, it&rsquo;s a bidirectional migration</p>
<p>of those two cell types,</p>
<p>or that for whatever reason, fertilization won&rsquo;t occur.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re really talking about</p>
<p>when we talk about the cumulative pregnancy rate over time</p>
<p>is the fact that there are multiple probabilities at work.</p>
<p>And yes, those are somewhat independent</p>
<p>in the sense that the biology of the sperm</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really strictly depend on the biology of the egg,</p>
<p>at least not until they meet and fertilize,</p>
<p>but the likelihood of pregnancy</p>
<p>depends on those independent probabilities,</p>
<p>which makes this a cumulative pregnancy rate.</p>
<p>Now, if any of that is confusing,</p>
<p>what it basically means is that for the egg and the sperm</p>
<p>to meet and to fertilize,</p>
<p>a number of different events</p>
<p>that carry some intentionality, right?</p>
<p>The sperm swims towards the egg and so forth,</p>
<p>the egg doesn&rsquo;t have a personality in there,</p>
<p>at least not yet,</p>
<p>but it quote unquote wants to be fertilized, right?</p>
<p>It is in principle receptive to fertilization.</p>
<p>Well, in order for that to happen,</p>
<p>there are going to be some events related to chance</p>
<p>that could limit the ability for that to happen.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;ll be other events dictated by the biology</p>
<p>of those two cell types</p>
<p>that are driving that event to happen,</p>
<p>that are biasing the event to yes, happen.</p>
<p>And so what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>when we talk about cumulative pregnancy rate</p>
<p>is how much of the biology of the woman</p>
<p>is skewed towards fertilization to be likely to occur, okay?</p>
<p>So to make this very simple,</p>
<p>all we need to know is that for women 30 years old</p>
<p>or younger, because the probability of getting pregnant</p>
<p>on any one attempt to conceive is 20%,</p>
<p>well, then if that doesn&rsquo;t occur the first time,</p>
<p>then she should simply repeat that at least five</p>
<p>and probably six times before deciding to go to an OB-GYN</p>
<p>and conclude that there&rsquo;s something going on</p>
<p>either with the egg or of course it could be with the sperm.</p>
<p>Okay, because 20 times five is 100,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re talking about cumulative percent.</p>
<p>So 20, 40, 60, 80, 100,</p>
<p>and the six month there would take you to 120%,</p>
<p>which is a different thing altogether.</p>
<p>But in general,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why OB-GYNs will tell their female patients,</p>
<p>look, if you&rsquo;re setting out to conceive,</p>
<p>try for about five or six months,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re not successful, come back and see me.</p>
<p>Now, for women who are age 31 to 33,</p>
<p>the probability of conceiving in that first month</p>
<p>drops to about 18%.</p>
<p>So women in that age range and their partners</p>
<p>should certainly try and conceive naturally</p>
<p>over a period of six or seven months</p>
<p>in order to get to that 100% cumulative probability.</p>
<p>And then for women who are age 34 to 37,</p>
<p>the probability of conceiving in that first month</p>
<p>of trying, and certainly every month thereafter,</p>
<p>is about 11%.</p>
<p>So when the age of the woman starts extending out</p>
<p>to about 34 or 35 years old,</p>
<p>then the typical advice of the OB-GYN</p>
<p>is going to be to attempt to conceive</p>
<p>over a period of about nine months to a year</p>
<p>before deciding to take some sort of medical intervention.</p>
<p>And then of course, as the age of the woman increases,</p>
<p>so too does the quality of the eggs go down.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s not true for every woman.</p>
<p>There are many women who in their late 30s and 40s,</p>
<p>and even early 50s</p>
<p>have successfully conceived healthy children,</p>
<p>although the probability of that,</p>
<p>the likelihood of it drops substantially.</p>
<p>So for instance, for women who are age 38 to 39,</p>
<p>the probability of a successful conception</p>
<p>by natural conception, intercourse with ejaculation,</p>
<p>is going to be about 5%, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really dropped to a quarter of what it was</p>
<p>when that woman was 30.</p>
<p>Again, these are averages only.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Well, it means that if you are age 38 or older,</p>
<p>chances are that you should probably go to your OB-GYN</p>
<p>right at the outset of your desire to conceive</p>
<p>and ask what you can do to improve egg quality.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if you were to extend the math out, right,</p>
<p>we know that if you&rsquo;re age 30 or younger,</p>
<p>20% chance in any one given month,</p>
<p>that means about four to six months of trying.</p>
<p>Well, you can simply multiply that times four or five</p>
<p>for someone in their late 30s or early 40s.</p>
<p>And so what you&rsquo;re really talking about</p>
<p>is several years of trying,</p>
<p>and of course what&rsquo;s happening during those several years,</p>
<p>the woman is getting older, and as a consequence,</p>
<p>the quality of the eggs is declining even further.</p>
<p>So if you are, you know, 35, 36 years old,</p>
<p>it might not be entirely unreasonable to talk to your OB-GYN</p>
<p>right at the outset of desiring to conceive,</p>
<p>but you could also just take the approach</p>
<p>of trying to conceive naturally</p>
<p>for about a year or a year and a half</p>
<p>before deciding to do that,</p>
<p>keeping in mind that all the while you can&rsquo;t stop time.</p>
<p>So biological time and aging</p>
<p>is going to occur in the backdrop.</p>
<p>But hopefully this description</p>
<p>of cumulative pregnancy rate makes sense.</p>
<p>Again, the idea is that while it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>that every single month,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an independent chance</p>
<p>of the woman getting pregnant,</p>
<p>and that chance is dropping from about 20% at age 30</p>
<p>over time to about really one to 3%</p>
<p>for women 40 or older.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also this notion of cumulative probability,</p>
<p>which involves multiple biological events</p>
<p>in both the egg and the sperm</p>
<p>that have to converge in time and space</p>
<p>in order for successful fertilization to occur.</p>
<p>Now, as long as we&rsquo;re on this topic,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s only fair to address the issue of miscarriage.</p>
<p>And miscarriages can arise from a variety of sources.</p>
<p>They can arise from genetic defects.</p>
<p>They can arise from issues in the milieu of the uterus.</p>
<p>They can arise from issues with the sperm,</p>
<p>for that matter, right?</p>
<p>We really don&rsquo;t want to put all the weight</p>
<p>and all the responsibility on the egg.</p>
<p>This is always an egg-sperm dynamic.</p>
<p>And when I say egg-sperm dynamic,</p>
<p>now hopefully that calls to mind</p>
<p>the huge library of information</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been covering up until now</p>
<p>about chromosomal segregation</p>
<p>and the coming together of these different cell types</p>
<p>and their genetic information.</p>
<p>Any number of different steps</p>
<p>within the process of fertilization leading up to pregnancy</p>
<p>can lead to miscarriage.</p>
<p>However, the probability of miscarriage</p>
<p>greatly increases as a function of the age of the egg.</p>
<p>And the basic numbers on this</p>
<p>are that for women who are 35 years or older,</p>
<p>about 25% of successful fertilizations</p>
<p>lead to miscarriages.</p>
<p>Now, when those miscarriages occur during pregnancy</p>
<p>can be highly variable.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s within the first trimester.</p>
<p>Sometimes it could be later,</p>
<p>but the probability is about 25%.</p>
<p>That probability increases greatly over time</p>
<p>such that by the time women are in their early 40s,</p>
<p>so 40 or older,</p>
<p>the probability of miscarriage</p>
<p>after a successful fertilization</p>
<p>is going to be about 50%.</p>
<p>And this could be due to a number of factors,</p>
<p>as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>but one common reason</p>
<p>is that there can be chromosomal abnormalities.</p>
<p>And that could be related typically</p>
<p>to the segregation of the egg</p>
<p>when half of the chromosomes in that egg are removed,</p>
<p>taking it from diploid to haploid.</p>
<p>If you recall, there&rsquo;s that little polar body,</p>
<p>which is the removal of the chromosomes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ejected from the egg that will eventually ovulate.</p>
<p>And sometimes not all the chromosomes</p>
<p>that were supposed to be ejected in that polar body</p>
<p>are ejected,</p>
<p>and as a consequence,</p>
<p>there are multiple chromosomes</p>
<p>or duplications of chromosomes,</p>
<p>things like trisomies.</p>
<p>Sometimes too many chromosomes move away,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re actually removal of entire chromosomes,</p>
<p>meaning both strands,</p>
<p>so that you have chromosomal deletions.</p>
<p>And in that case,</p>
<p>typically fertilization won&rsquo;t occur,</p>
<p>but there are instances in which fertilization will occur.</p>
<p>So a woman will get a positive pregnancy test,</p>
<p>her periods will stop,</p>
<p>and the couple will think</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re advancing along the steps</p>
<p>to a successful pregnancy,</p>
<p>and then there will be sadly a miscarriage.</p>
<p>Many, many times,</p>
<p>those miscarriages are the consequence of the fact</p>
<p>that when there are extra chromosomes there,</p>
<p>or there are too few chromosomes present,</p>
<p>that embryogenesis can simply not progress in a healthy way.</p>
<p>There are some instances in which all of the chromosomes</p>
<p>and all the chromosomal arrangements are perfectly normal,</p>
<p>and miscarriages can still occur.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do a future episode</p>
<p>about pregnancy and embryonic development,</p>
<p>where we will get into this more deeply,</p>
<p>but just understand that the frequency of miscarriages</p>
<p>increases dramatically after about age 34,</p>
<p>and then continues to increase dramatically,</p>
<p>extending well out until the 40s.</p>
<p>Now, a very important consideration</p>
<p>in terms of understanding and predicting fertility</p>
<p>and fecundability,</p>
<p>this word that describes the probability</p>
<p>of getting pregnant on a given try and over time,</p>
<p>is trying to address how quote-unquote fertile a woman is,</p>
<p>and importantly, how quote-unquote fertile a male is.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;ll talk about the male side in a moment,</p>
<p>but when trying to address how fertile a woman is,</p>
<p>of course, age is going to be one of the major factors,</p>
<p>but just one factor, all right?</p>
<p>We already talked about how age determines</p>
<p>the likelihood of a successful pregnancy.</p>
<p>If the intercourse and ejaculation is being carried out</p>
<p>at the correct times and with viable sperm</p>
<p>capable of fertilizing eggs,</p>
<p>and then of course there&rsquo;s the issue of egg quality,</p>
<p>but in general, most women would like to know</p>
<p>how fertile they are as a function of their age, right?</p>
<p>And I actually think this is one of the most important topics</p>
<p>in this whole space around fertility</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t often discussed,</p>
<p>or at least isn&rsquo;t often discussed</p>
<p>until women are in their late 30s or 40s,</p>
<p>when oftentimes they will look back</p>
<p>and wish that either they had frozen their eggs</p>
<p>or they had frozen fertilized embryos,</p>
<p>which is a whole thing unto itself.</p>
<p>I mean, talk about that when we have an episode</p>
<p>on in vitro fertilization in more depth,</p>
<p>but there is a fairly straightforward way or set of ways</p>
<p>that women can determine their basic level of fertility,</p>
<p>leaving aside a lot of the detailed issues</p>
<p>about the quality of eggs and so forth.</p>
<p>One thing that you already learned</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s this vault,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this reserve that we call the ovarian reserve,</p>
<p>and that each month,</p>
<p>a certain number of follicles leave that reserve,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s the opportunity</p>
<p>based on the ovulation of a single egg</p>
<p>to fertilize that egg and for the woman to get pregnant.</p>
<p>And one thing that we know for sure</p>
<p>is that the size of the population</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s released from that vault each month</p>
<p>has a very strong positive correlation</p>
<p>with the size of the reserve in the vault itself, okay?</p>
<p>So the way to think about this perhaps</p>
<p>is that the vault is like a bank account,</p>
<p>has a certain amount of money, in this case, eggs in it,</p>
<p>and you could imagine if someone&rsquo;s reasonably logical</p>
<p>that if they have more money in their bank account,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re going to withdraw a larger amount each month</p>
<p>than if they have a small amount each month</p>
<p>if the idea is to make that vault, that bank of eggs,</p>
<p>available to them over the longest period of time.</p>
<p>And indeed, biology is pretty smart.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t deploy or release half the follicles</p>
<p>in one month and then just slowly trickle out</p>
<p>the remainder of follicles.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not how it works.</p>
<p>What you find is that, of course, in younger women,</p>
<p>so say in their late teens, 20s, and 30s,</p>
<p>the ovarian reserve in the vault</p>
<p>is going to have more eggs in it,</p>
<p>and the number of follicles and eggs</p>
<p>that leave that vault each month is going to be quite high.</p>
<p>So one way to evaluate how, quote-unquote, fertile you are,</p>
<p>again, just one way, is to go to your OB-GYN</p>
<p>and say that you would like to know</p>
<p>how many follicles you have in a given month.</p>
<p>And of course, they&rsquo;ll look at them</p>
<p>on both sides in both ovaries.</p>
<p>And for instance, if a woman has just two or three follicles</p>
<p>that are out each month, well, then the assumption,</p>
<p>again, it&rsquo;s just an assumption,</p>
<p>but the assumption that&rsquo;s pretty good</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s this positive correlation</p>
<p>that generally occurs is that that ovarian reserve,</p>
<p>that the number of eggs in the vault is fairly low</p>
<p>compared to someone who, say, has 20 follicles</p>
<p>or 30 follicles each month, okay?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the typical trend.</p>
<p>Again, these are averages,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very important to not get attached</p>
<p>to any one number here.</p>
<p>Again, these are averages.</p>
<p>So for instance, there are women</p>
<p>who only deploy five follicles and eggs each month</p>
<p>out of their ovarian vault,</p>
<p>but who find themselves to be very fertile, right?</p>
<p>And there could be a number of different factors</p>
<p>to explain that.</p>
<p>Other women will have 20 or 30 eggs and follicles</p>
<p>that leave that vault, the ovarian reserve, each month,</p>
<p>and they will have a harder time getting pregnant</p>
<p>for any number of different reasons.</p>
<p>But in general, the more eggs and follicles</p>
<p>that leave the vault each month,</p>
<p>the higher number of eggs that are still in reserve,</p>
<p>meaning the greater amount of time</p>
<p>over which a given woman could still attempt</p>
<p>to have successful fertilizations.</p>
<p>Now, this small collection of follicles and eggs</p>
<p>that are released each month actually has a name.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called antral follicles.</p>
<p>These are small follicles.</p>
<p>They tend to be about two to nine millimeters across.</p>
<p>The way these are analyzed or measured</p>
<p>is woman will go into the OB-GYN office</p>
<p>and by ultrasound, typically there&rsquo;s some local anesthesia,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not often a general anesthesia,</p>
<p>but by local anesthesia, sometimes no anesthesia,</p>
<p>they will essentially count the number of follicles</p>
<p>that are present in each side,</p>
<p>on ovary on the left and the ovary on the right,</p>
<p>and give a woman some sense of how many follicles she has.</p>
<p>And typically this is done over a series of months</p>
<p>to determine how many eggs</p>
<p>are leaving the ovarian reserve each month,</p>
<p>and therefore how many eggs she is likely</p>
<p>to still have in the ovarian reserve.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a non-invasive way to do this as well,</p>
<p>although typically an OB-GYN will do</p>
<p>both what I just described with ultrasound</p>
<p>and measure something called AMH,</p>
<p>which is anti-Mullerian hormone,</p>
<p>which is a hormone that is released</p>
<p>by that antral follicle population,</p>
<p>the population of follicles and eggs</p>
<p>that leave the ovarian reserve each month.</p>
<p>So one is a blood draw measure of a hormone AMH,</p>
<p>the other is a structural imaging measure</p>
<p>of the antral follicles directly.</p>
<p>Again, the typical trend is for the number</p>
<p>of antral follicles to decline over time.</p>
<p>So one might expect, for instance,</p>
<p>that a woman in her 20s or 30s might have 20, 30,</p>
<p>maybe even 40 antral follicles</p>
<p>that are exiting the reserve each month.</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s the total across both ovaries.</p>
<p>Again, these are just averages,</p>
<p>these are going to be distributions,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be people with far fewer,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be people with far more,</p>
<p>but that over time, regardless of where a woman starts out,</p>
<p>from one decade to the next half decade and decade and so on</p>
<p>that the number of antral follicles will decline</p>
<p>and the amount of, or the levels of AMH will also decline.</p>
<p>So what does this all mean?</p>
<p>What this means is that if you are a woman</p>
<p>who is in her 20s or 30s or 40s,</p>
<p>whatever your age,</p>
<p>if you are interested in conceiving in the future,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very likely a good idea to go to your OB-GYN</p>
<p>and get either your AMH levels measured</p>
<p>or your follicle count measured.</p>
<p>And to do that several times in a given period,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t mean a menstrual period,</p>
<p>I mean a given period of time across several months</p>
<p>to determine what is the average number of follicles,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your average AMH level,</p>
<p>thereby giving you some window into how many eggs</p>
<p>you are likely to still have in your ovarian reserve.</p>
<p>I cannot tell you how many women that I&rsquo;ve spoken to</p>
<p>and how many OB-GYNs more importantly,</p>
<p>because they speak to many more women about this</p>
<p>than I ever have or ever will,</p>
<p>wish that they had done this earlier, right?</p>
<p>They think, oh, well, I&rsquo;m in my 20s,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m likely to have a ton of follicles</p>
<p>or they got pregnant once before.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re not so concerned about the number of follicles</p>
<p>or their AMH levels.</p>
<p>But over and over again,</p>
<p>I was told in researching for this episode</p>
<p>that the earlier and more frequent</p>
<p>that women do this procedure of measuring AMH</p>
<p>and measuring their follicle count,</p>
<p>the higher the probability that they will eventually</p>
<p>have a successful fertilization and pregnancy</p>
<p>when they seek to do so.</p>
<p>Now, the mirror image of all this, of course, is the sperm.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a kind of common misconception out there</p>
<p>that the sperm, you only need one</p>
<p>and indeed you only need one,</p>
<p>but actually you need many and it&rsquo;s only one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s able to successfully fertilize the egg.</p>
<p>So this whole concept of you only need one</p>
<p>is both dismissive of the sperm,</p>
<p>but more importantly, dismissive of the biology</p>
<p>of the sperm and the egg.</p>
<p>Okay, it only takes one successful sperm</p>
<p>and one successful egg,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s sort of like telling a woman,</p>
<p>hey, you only need one egg, right?</p>
<p>You need one egg of sufficient quality</p>
<p>in the right time and place.</p>
<p>And you need one sperm of sufficient quality</p>
<p>in the right time and place</p>
<p>in order to get successful fertilization</p>
<p>and hopefully pregnancy.</p>
<p>But you need a lot of sperm</p>
<p>in order to get a high probability</p>
<p>that that one sperm will be able</p>
<p>to successfully fertilize the egg.</p>
<p>So we have this image of sperm</p>
<p>as kind of these dumb operators</p>
<p>that just sort of swim mindlessly towards anything.</p>
<p>And if they bump into an egg, then they fertilize the egg.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really not the way it works.</p>
<p>As I talked about earlier,</p>
<p>the sperm with its head, its mid region, its tail,</p>
<p>chock-a-block with mitochondria in the mid region</p>
<p>is really an active motile cell</p>
<p>that indeed will just swim forward</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a healthy forward-progressing sperm.</p>
<p>But many males out there</p>
<p>just simply do not have any knowledge</p>
<p>of how many quality sperm that they happen to have.</p>
<p>Now, given the fact that sperm analysis</p>
<p>is relatively inexpensive,</p>
<p>and also the fact that freezing sperm</p>
<p>is relatively inexpensive,</p>
<p>I think it stands to reason that most men</p>
<p>should at least get some window</p>
<p>into the numbering quality of their sperm.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s a fair assumption to say</p>
<p>that if someone is in their late teens, early twenties,</p>
<p>or thirties, that they probably have high quality sperm.</p>
<p>But again, as with the egg</p>
<p>and the importance of measuring AMH</p>
<p>and follicle count across time,</p>
<p>men should really evaluate the quality</p>
<p>and number of their sperm.</p>
<p>And we talked a little bit earlier</p>
<p>about some of the parameters</p>
<p>that urologists and OBGYNs like to see</p>
<p>when evaluating sperm, right?</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a minimum number</p>
<p>or concentration of sperm that they&rsquo;d like to see</p>
<p>if a couple is going to use IVF in vitro fertilization.</p>
<p>And typically that&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>about 15 to 20 million per mil of sperm or semen.</p>
<p>And typically they want to see</p>
<p>somewhere between two and five milliliters of semen overall</p>
<p>in a given ejaculate after a 72 to 48 hour abstinence period</p>
<p>because of course, the more ejaculations,</p>
<p>the smaller the volume of the ejaculate</p>
<p>in a short period of time.</p>
<p>But after 48 to 72 hours,</p>
<p>you more or less maximize the volume of ejaculate.</p>
<p>And then of course they want to see 50,</p>
<p>but typically 60% or more of motile sperm</p>
<p>in order to get IVF, but more is better.</p>
<p>And of course there is an enormous range</p>
<p>as I mentioned before.</p>
<p>Some males will have anywhere from 10 to 20 million</p>
<p>sperm per milliliter of ejaculate.</p>
<p>And some men will have 100 to 200 million, okay?</p>
<p>But just because they have 100 to 200 million</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that all of those sperm</p>
<p>are of high quality and can fertilize eggs.</p>
<p>Sometimes the more than half will be twitchers</p>
<p>and some will be a motile and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very straightforward</p>
<p>what I believe most people should do</p>
<p>and what the urologists I spoke to</p>
<p>in advance of this episode said to do,</p>
<p>which is to simply do a sperm analysis,</p>
<p>refrain from ejaculation for 48 to 72 hours,</p>
<p>give a sperm sample, have that sperm sample analyzed.</p>
<p>The cost of the sperm analysis is not typically that much.</p>
<p>Okay, and considering that conception</p>
<p>and healthy conception and fertilization</p>
<p>is an expensive process</p>
<p>if you have to go the in vitro fertilization route,</p>
<p>it stands to reason that the cost is pretty well justified.</p>
<p>You also have the option to freeze sperm over time.</p>
<p>There is evidence that the age of the father</p>
<p>and therefore the age of the sperm</p>
<p>can dictate whether or not there&rsquo;s a higher instance</p>
<p>of problematic pregnancy or developmental outcomes,</p>
<p>including autism, that is true.</p>
<p>You probably heard that if the father is 40 years or older,</p>
<p>the incidence of autism is increased significantly.</p>
<p>That is true, although the overall probability</p>
<p>of having an autistic offspring,</p>
<p>if somebody, if the father that is, is 40 years or older,</p>
<p>is still quite a bit lower than you would imagine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as if the probability suddenly skyrockets, okay?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll have an episode on autism</p>
<p>and genetic and non-genetic influences on autism</p>
<p>and other aspects of the autism spectrum.</p>
<p>But the point is this, I believe,</p>
<p>and the urologists I spoke to</p>
<p>who are interested in fertility and male health</p>
<p>and sexual health suggest that men get their sperm analyzed</p>
<p>at least once every five years.</p>
<p>And certainly if they&rsquo;re going to want to conceive children</p>
<p>in the distant future,</p>
<p>that they consider freezing their sperm</p>
<p>because that too is fairly nominal cost</p>
<p>in order to freeze sperm at a younger age.</p>
<p>And of course, if you can freeze and use sperm</p>
<p>from the time in which you were younger,</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t you, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you can still opt to go for natural pregnancy later</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what you want to do,</p>
<p>but having that in reserve is generally a good idea.</p>
<p>And I discussed some of the parameters that are looked for,</p>
<p>and perhaps most importantly,</p>
<p>there is the possibility of an underlying issue</p>
<p>whereby, for instance,</p>
<p>there is very little sperm in an ejaculate.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>the seminal fluid in the ejaculate</p>
<p>could have zero sperm in it,</p>
<p>but the volume of ejaculate could appear completely normal.</p>
<p>So just because your ejaculate volume is normal to you</p>
<p>or is in that range of, you know, two to five milliliters,</p>
<p>well, then it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean</p>
<p>that there are any sperm there</p>
<p>or that there are very few sperm there.</p>
<p>And the few sperm that are there</p>
<p>or the many sperm that are there are functionally motile.</p>
<p>So get this analyzed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really worth doing.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s not something you have to do every year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that you want to do probably every five years,</p>
<p>at least until the point where you&rsquo;ve conceived</p>
<p>as many children as you ever want to conceive.</p>
<p>So the basic takeaway here is that if you&rsquo;re a woman,</p>
<p>to get your egg count, your antral follicle count, that is,</p>
<p>and therefore your reserve of eggs indirectly measured,</p>
<p>and of course, also get your AMH levels measured.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re a male, to have a sperm analysis</p>
<p>and to do that relatively early.</p>
<p>In fact, another incentive for doing that early</p>
<p>is that you have a comparison point</p>
<p>so that, for instance, if you are in your early 20s</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not thinking about having kids at all,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re thinking that you might someday have kids,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a really someday, someday, far off in the future,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s wonderful to have a reference point</p>
<p>from which to compare your biology in your early 20s</p>
<p>to your biology in your mid or late 30s or 40s</p>
<p>when you might happen to be interested in conceiving.</p>
<p>And if that doesn&rsquo;t provide incentive enough,</p>
<p>I should mention, and this is important to point out,</p>
<p>and that I think both males and females are not aware of,</p>
<p>is that one in five couples that have issues with fertility,</p>
<p>the issue ends up falling on the biology,</p>
<p>that is the quality of the sperm</p>
<p>or a lack of number of sperm.</p>
<p>So, you know, I think there&rsquo;s a misconception</p>
<p>that when fertility is an issue,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always an issue with the eggs</p>
<p>and this age-dependent decline in egg quality,</p>
<p>again, it&rsquo;s the best language we have available to us</p>
<p>at the moment, this age-dependent decline in egg quality</p>
<p>is often to blame, but not always.</p>
<p>One in five couples that have challenges conceiving</p>
<p>turns out that it&rsquo;s going to be an issue with the sperm.</p>
<p>And of course, there are a number of different</p>
<p>sperm analyses that should all the other parameters</p>
<p>of sperm appear normal.</p>
<p>Now, for instance, you can get a DNA fragmentation analysis,</p>
<p>you can see whether or not the DNA of the sperm</p>
<p>are somehow disrupted.</p>
<p>Urologists these days are excellent at figuring out,</p>
<p>for instance, if a male has lots and lots of sperm,</p>
<p>everything looks great,</p>
<p>but the shape of the head of the sperm isn&rsquo;t quite right,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s not oval enough and it&rsquo;s too rounded,</p>
<p>that could be a genetic defect,</p>
<p>under which conditions there is zero probability</p>
<p>of the male ever naturally conceiving, right?</p>
<p>Regardless of who the female partner is,</p>
<p>believe it or not, males can have a ton of sperm,</p>
<p>but if they carry a certain genetic defect,</p>
<p>those sperm will be incapable of depositing</p>
<p>those 23 chromosomes into the egg.</p>
<p>However, there are ways in which that sperm can be coaxed</p>
<p>or forced to fertilize the egg and deposit</p>
<p>its genetic contents by in vitro fertilization</p>
<p>and then implantation into the female.</p>
<p>So again, lots of reasons to have a egg reserve analysis</p>
<p>by ultrasound and AMH for females,</p>
<p>and lots of reasons for males to have a sperm analysis.</p>
<p>And of course, typically with a sperm analysis</p>
<p>and a ovarian reserve analysis will be a hormone analysis.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a very strong believer in people getting an insight</p>
<p>that is a window into their hormonal composition,</p>
<p>not just when they encounter problems,</p>
<p>but starting at a pretty early age,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s only done once every five years or so,</p>
<p>having a reference point to your 20s and to your 30s</p>
<p>and mid 30s for when you felt a certain way,</p>
<p>maybe as in the case for many people I know,</p>
<p>they actually feel better in their 40s</p>
<p>than they did in their 20s,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re doing a lot of things</p>
<p>to support their health, that is possible.</p>
<p>But in many cases, people start feeling not as well,</p>
<p>or their fertility seems to be dropping off,</p>
<p>or any number of different parameters</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve discussed today,</p>
<p>or related to vitality and longevity</p>
<p>seem to be dropping off over time.</p>
<p>And they want to get a insight into what could be the issue.</p>
<p>And hormones are sometimes, not always,</p>
<p>but sometimes involved in those underlying issues.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing as valuable as having a reference point</p>
<p>from a time in which things were going well</p>
<p>to evaluate the, for instance, the levels of hormones,</p>
<p>not just testosterone,</p>
<p>but also estrogen and progesterone and so forth.</p>
<p>So you need a comparison point</p>
<p>in order to determine what really needs to be changed.</p>
<p>So all of this is a strong push for people</p>
<p>to use your insurance,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re able to put it on insurance,</p>
<p>oftentimes people are.</p>
<p>And if not, to try and find a reasonable</p>
<p>or reasonably priced way to do a sperm and egg analysis,</p>
<p>and to ideally do a hormone analysis as well,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really going to set you up</p>
<p>for the maximum probability of being able</p>
<p>to conceive children when you want to,</p>
<p>and also to avoid a bunch of other health-related issues</p>
<p>that involve hormones and reproductive health,</p>
<p>and in general, to support your mental health</p>
<p>and physical health.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been talking about a bunch of things to do.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things to be mindful of</p>
<p>to actively avoid if your goal is to be and remain fertile,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>you want to conceive children in the future or not.</p>
<p>Now, in the context of this discussion,</p>
<p>the same things that we&rsquo;ve heard to be true</p>
<p>for other aspects of our health turn out to also be true.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just start with the basics.</p>
<p>Everybody should be getting approximately</p>
<p>six to eight hours of sleep every night.</p>
<p>That should be quality sleep.</p>
<p>Optimizing your sleep is fundamental</p>
<p>to balancing your hormones.</p>
<p>Now, balancing your hormones is kind of a catchphrase</p>
<p>for all things related to proper hormone regulation.</p>
<p>Sleep is the fundamental layer of mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance of all kinds,</p>
<p>and believe it or not, fertility.</p>
<p>When people are not sleeping well or enough,</p>
<p>stress hormones, in particular cortisol,</p>
<p>shift to peaking later in the day,</p>
<p>and those elevated cortisol levels later in the day</p>
<p>cause a bunch of different problems</p>
<p>in both males and females, many of which impact fertility.</p>
<p>So controlling cortisol starts with controlling your sleep.</p>
<p>It also impacts testosterone and estrogen levels.</p>
<p>So of course, the proper ratios of testosterone</p>
<p>and estrogen will vary from males to females,</p>
<p>but in order to get those right,</p>
<p>or as right as they can be without other interventions,</p>
<p>you want to make sure you&rsquo;re getting enough quality sleep.</p>
<p>How much sleep?</p>
<p>Most people need about six to eight hours</p>
<p>of sleep per night.</p>
<p>Waking up once, maybe twice per night</p>
<p>in the middle of the night and going back to sleep</p>
<p>is not such a big deal,</p>
<p>but six to eight hours of solid sleep would be ideal.</p>
<p>Some people need a little bit less</p>
<p>in order to function, five hours.</p>
<p>Some people need a little bit more.</p>
<p>Developing teenagers and babies and kids need a lot more.</p>
<p>People who are sick or recovering from injury</p>
<p>need a lot more.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done multiple episodes on sleep.</p>
<p>We have a toolkit for sleep available free</p>
<p>at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>You go there, you don&rsquo;t even have to sign up</p>
<p>for the newsletter, although you can if you want.</p>
<p>Just go to Toolkit for Sleep under the menu,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be able to download that,</p>
<p>or you can even just view it on the screen</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t want to download it.</p>
<p>It has lots of tools.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done an episode called Perfect Your Sleep</p>
<p>that has a lot of tools.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all timestamped for you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done a Master Your Sleep episodes,</p>
<p>lots of tools to get your sleep right.</p>
<p>Get your sleep right if you are wishing to conceive</p>
<p>and or to simply have healthy biology</p>
<p>to be fertile or otherwise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just fundamental.</p>
<p>Now, there are other things to not do,</p>
<p>and those again fall into the somewhat obvious categories,</p>
<p>but I think a lot of people aren&rsquo;t aware</p>
<p>of just how striking an effect</p>
<p>these certain behaviors that you want to avoid</p>
<p>can have in diminishing your fertility</p>
<p>for both males and females.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about those.</p>
<p>So the first one is smoking.</p>
<p>And when we talk about smoking here,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about smoking nicotine,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re talking about smoking cannabis.</p>
<p>And indeed there are strong data,</p>
<p>and I will put a reference to one of the better,</p>
<p>larger analyses of these data.</p>
<p>There are strong data showing</p>
<p>that cannabis reduces fertility.</p>
<p>Now I can already hear the screams from the back,</p>
<p>although they&rsquo;re probably fairly drawled out screams</p>
<p>from the back of people saying they smoke cannabis</p>
<p>and they had no trouble conceiving.</p>
<p>Certainly there will be exceptions,</p>
<p>but whether or not you&rsquo;re male or female,</p>
<p>smoking cannabis is a bad idea</p>
<p>if you want to conceive a healthy child.</p>
<p>Can you still conceive a healthy child</p>
<p>while smoking cannabis?</p>
<p>Probably certain people can.</p>
<p>Many people will greatly decrease the probability</p>
<p>of a healthy fertilization and pregnancy</p>
<p>by smoking cannabis.</p>
<p>There are excellent data to support that.</p>
<p>As well, nicotine, both smoked or vaped,</p>
<p>is going to disrupt the process of fertilization</p>
<p>and can disrupt pregnancy dramatically, okay?</p>
<p>So just avoid it altogether.</p>
<p>How does this happen?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that smoking increases</p>
<p>what are called reactive oxygen species.</p>
<p>This greatly disrupts the quality of the egg</p>
<p>at the level of the spindle and mitochondria</p>
<p>and a number of other features.</p>
<p>And in the sperm,</p>
<p>turns out that smoking doesn&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>disrupt the sperm directly,</p>
<p>although it can cause DNA fragmentation,</p>
<p>which can cause all sorts of abnormalities,</p>
<p>can prevent fertilization,</p>
<p>can lead to birth defects in the offspring.</p>
<p>But more importantly,</p>
<p>it increases what are called reactive oxygen species</p>
<p>in the seminal fluid,</p>
<p>in the semen that contain the sperm.</p>
<p>This very, under normal circumstances,</p>
<p>under healthy circumstances,</p>
<p>beautifully orchestrated chemistry of fluid</p>
<p>that allows the sperm to thrive in their trajectory</p>
<p>and attempt to fertilize the egg</p>
<p>and lead to a healthy pregnancy.</p>
<p>So if you are a smoker and you want to conceive,</p>
<p>the best advice I can give you is to quit smoking</p>
<p>and yes, that includes cannabis as well.</p>
<p>Now, I am not somebody who believes that cannabis</p>
<p>across the board is not useful.</p>
<p>There are medical applications and other applications.</p>
<p>I talk about that in an episode all about cannabis</p>
<p>for health and disease and notice health was in there too.</p>
<p>So you cannabis smokers don&rsquo;t come after me with,</p>
<p>I guess, whatever it is,</p>
<p>with bongs and pipes or whatever it is that you want</p>
<p>or with vapes.</p>
<p>The point is that while it can be beneficial</p>
<p>for certain populations,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s certainly bad for others.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re trying to conceive,</p>
<p>it is bad for fertility and for a healthy pregnancy, okay?</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s smoking and vaping, by the way, okay?</p>
<p>Vaping is included there.</p>
<p>Now the next category of don&rsquo;ts relates to alcohol.</p>
<p>Now everyone has heard that drinking during pregnancy</p>
<p>is a bad idea.</p>
<p>You may have heard,</p>
<p>and some people have talked about the fact that</p>
<p>there are cultures in which they allow, if you will,</p>
<p>or even condone, sadly, one or two drinks while pregnant,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s just champagne</p>
<p>or something of that sort.</p>
<p>That is a terrible idea.</p>
<p>I did an episode all about alcohol,</p>
<p>both its potential health effects</p>
<p>of which there turned out to be zero.</p>
<p>And yes, that includes red wine.</p>
<p>It is far better to not drink at all.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re going to drink,</p>
<p>the limit if you&rsquo;re a healthy adult</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s not trying to conceive, not pregnant,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have issues with alcoholism</p>
<p>is probably two drinks per week total.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, two drinks per week total.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the level that you really should consider</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a drinker,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s trying to conceive.</p>
<p>However, for a woman who becomes pregnant,</p>
<p>the total number of drinks</p>
<p>that you should allow yourself per week while pregnant</p>
<p>and breastfeeding is indeed zero.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no evidence</p>
<p>that one can quote unquote get away with drinking</p>
<p>during pregnancy.</p>
<p>And people say, well, I had a perfectly healthy child,</p>
<p>but of course you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what the health of that child would have been</p>
<p>had you not drank at all.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not here with any generally strong stance</p>
<p>against alcohol.</p>
<p>I myself am somebody who has a drink every once in a while,</p>
<p>although I don&rsquo;t consider myself somebody</p>
<p>who has a strong proclivity for alcohol.</p>
<p>And of course, at this moment,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to conceive children</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m certainly not pregnant.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s safe for me,</p>
<p>but frankly, I haven&rsquo;t had a drink in a very long time.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t miss it and that&rsquo;s me,</p>
<p>but I do realize that a lot of people enjoy alcohol.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s that two drinks per week limit</p>
<p>that really sets the upper limit and threshold</p>
<p>beyond which you start running into issues</p>
<p>with cellular mutation.</p>
<p>You start running into issues of oxidative stress,</p>
<p>greatly increased cancer risk,</p>
<p>in particular, breast cancer risk.</p>
<p>All of that&rsquo;s covered in the alcohol episode that we did.</p>
<p>You can find it hubermanlab.com and timestamped</p>
<p>if you want to navigate to specific topics and so forth,</p>
<p>find out all about the data,</p>
<p>supporting the statements that I&rsquo;m making,</p>
<p>so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s seeking to conceive</p>
<p>or you fall into this category</p>
<p>that some couples describe themselves as we&rsquo;re not trying,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not not trying,</p>
<p>meaning they&rsquo;re not using birth control,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of letting chance run its course.</p>
<p>Well, then you should definitely be aware of the data</p>
<p>showing that even just one bout,</p>
<p>one bout of so-called binge drinking,</p>
<p>which is five to six drinks in a given night</p>
<p>or half day in a 12 hour period,</p>
<p>one bout of five to six drinks.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a woman or you&rsquo;re a man,</p>
<p>greatly increases both the likelihood of mutations</p>
<p>in the embryo that would result from a fertilization.</p>
<p>And at the same time,</p>
<p>for reasons that should be obvious to you</p>
<p>based on all the biology we&rsquo;ve talked about,</p>
<p>a greatly reduced probability of fertilization.</p>
<p>Now, that absolutely does not mean</p>
<p>that you should use the ingestion of five or six drinks</p>
<p>as a method of birth control.</p>
<p>That is not what I&rsquo;m saying here.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is that if you go out on a given night</p>
<p>and you have five or six drinks</p>
<p>and you happen to become pregnant,</p>
<p>the probability that that pregnancy</p>
<p>will be disrupted in some way is greatly increased.</p>
<p>What the exact consequences are, no one can tell you.</p>
<p>But also if you&rsquo;re somebody who is interested</p>
<p>in conceiving a child,</p>
<p>well, then you absolutely should abstain</p>
<p>from ingesting drinks more than one or two</p>
<p>during the time in which you&rsquo;re trying to conceive.</p>
<p>And ideally it would be zero.</p>
<p>And you certainly would want to avoid</p>
<p>drinking multiple drinks per night.</p>
<p>And so this idea of going out and having, you know,</p>
<p>three or four drinks or four or five drinks in a given night</p>
<p>at a time in which you&rsquo;re also trying to conceive children,</p>
<p>the biology tells us, the epidemiology tells us</p>
<p>that this is just a terrible idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to reduce the likelihood of fertility</p>
<p>and successful pregnancy.</p>
<p>And if there is a successful pregnancy,</p>
<p>the word success needs to be in quotes, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I think every parent,</p>
<p>every species for that matter,</p>
<p>wants to increase the probability</p>
<p>of having healthy offspring.</p>
<p>And so to my mind anyway,</p>
<p>and to the OBGYNs and the urologists</p>
<p>that are focused on fertility that I spoke to,</p>
<p>everyone will say, try as hard as you can</p>
<p>to avoid these so-called binge drinking episodes.</p>
<p>And again, these episodes are one night</p>
<p>of consuming five to six drinks.</p>
<p>Now, another important thing to remember in this context</p>
<p>is that the negative effects of consuming</p>
<p>five or six drinks in a given night</p>
<p>extend over many weeks</p>
<p>following the ingestion of that alcohol.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a male,</p>
<p>what that means is that&rsquo;s going to impact</p>
<p>the quality of your sperm</p>
<p>and greatly decrease the likelihood</p>
<p>of successful fertilization and or healthy pregnancy</p>
<p>over the period of that entire spermatogenesis window,</p>
<p>which is as we talked about before, 60 to 90 days, right?</p>
<p>60 to generate the sperm</p>
<p>and then in some additional time for the sperm</p>
<p>to be transported to the point</p>
<p>where they could be ejaculated.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a woman and you have five or six drinks</p>
<p>on a given night,</p>
<p>well, then you are going to disrupt the quality</p>
<p>not of just the egg that eventually ovulates,</p>
<p>but indeed the entire pool of follicles</p>
<p>that leaves the ovarian vault and reserve</p>
<p>and from which the one egg will be selected.</p>
<p>In other words, you are reducing the quality</p>
<p>of all of the eggs that you happen to deploy that month.</p>
<p>Now, some of you who were really following</p>
<p>the biology earlier might say,</p>
<p>well, what if I have those five or six drinks</p>
<p>during the time in which I&rsquo;m menstruating,</p>
<p>just in which there&rsquo;s bleeding present</p>
<p>and therefore I haven&rsquo;t yet ovulated.</p>
<p>Ah, but if you remember the biology</p>
<p>we talked about earlier specifically,</p>
<p>there is a subset of follicles and eggs</p>
<p>that leave that ovarian reserve</p>
<p>quite a bit before that one egg is selected for</p>
<p>and ovulates.</p>
<p>And of course there are all the different hormonal cascades</p>
<p>in the general milieu of the ovary,</p>
<p>which are important and are being regulated</p>
<p>by different hormones.</p>
<p>And yes, indeed, the regulation of those hormones</p>
<p>is strongly impacted by alcohol</p>
<p>through a number of different pathways,</p>
<p>through the regulation of the neurotransmitter GABA</p>
<p>up in the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a lot of GABA and GABA receptors</p>
<p>in the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>the very region from which gonadotropin-releasing hormone,</p>
<p>our old friend from a couple hours ago in this discussion,</p>
<p>going to disrupt GnRH secretion.</p>
<p>You can disrupt pituitary function with alcohol.</p>
<p>Again and again, what we&rsquo;re seeing is that</p>
<p>consuming more than one or two drinks per week of alcohol</p>
<p>is really detrimental to the entire process of fertility</p>
<p>and the entire process of healthy pregnancy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true from both the male side and the sperm</p>
<p>and is true from the female side and the egg.</p>
<p>So my simple advice on this is if you are wishing to have</p>
<p>a healthy fertilization and pregnancy,</p>
<p>the best thing to do would be avoid alcohol together.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re going to drink,</p>
<p>to really limit that drinking to one or two drinks</p>
<p>per week maximum.</p>
<p>So those are the major don&rsquo;ts.</p>
<p>Really avoid excessive stress.</p>
<p>And I should mention excessive stress is not just</p>
<p>best avoided by getting enough quality sleep at night,</p>
<p>although that is the primary way.</p>
<p>There are other ways to avoid stress.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done entire episodes about this</p>
<p>and we have a toolkit related to reducing stress</p>
<p>with very simple zero cost tools.</p>
<p>Again, you can find all that hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>I should mention if you want to find any episode or topic</p>
<p>or timestamp, that website is keyword search available.</p>
<p>So you can just go to hubermanlab.com,</p>
<p>put into the search function, stress tools,</p>
<p>and a bunch of different links will pop up</p>
<p>related to those topics.</p>
<p>Likewise with sleep,</p>
<p>likewise with any number of different topics</p>
<p>you might be interested in.</p>
<p>So get enough quality sleep and thereby reduce stress</p>
<p>and also directly buffer stress with real-time tools</p>
<p>to buffer stress that I&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>in the episodes that you can access.</p>
<p>And there are ways to greatly reduce</p>
<p>your overall level of stress,</p>
<p>to limit any cortisol that&rsquo;s released early in the day,</p>
<p>which is when you want cortisol released</p>
<p>and not have it late in the day and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So reduce your stress.</p>
<p>And as I just told you,</p>
<p>by all means do not drink more than two drinks per week</p>
<p>and zero is better than two.</p>
<p>If anyone tells you,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s all this resveratrol in red wine</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s good for us,</p>
<p>the data simply tell us that there&rsquo;s not enough resveratrol</p>
<p>in red wine to really have any positive health benefit.</p>
<p>The data around resveratrol and health benefits itself</p>
<p>is under question nowadays.</p>
<p>Zero alcohol is better than any alcohol.</p>
<p>Two drinks per week is the limit.</p>
<p>Also limit or eliminate or avoid nicotine</p>
<p>and ideally cannabis smoking and vaping at the time</p>
<p>in which you are trying to get pregnant.</p>
<p>And certainly if you are pregnant,</p>
<p>avoid all of the things as best you can</p>
<p>that I just described a moment ago.</p>
<p>Now there are a couple other don&rsquo;ts</p>
<p>that are really important.</p>
<p>One of the most important don&rsquo;ts relates to STIs</p>
<p>or sexually transmitted infections.</p>
<p>Everyone who&rsquo;s sexually active should get an STI check.</p>
<p>In fact, if you go to a fertility clinic</p>
<p>or you go for sperm analysis or you go for egg analysis,</p>
<p>almost always they will do an STI check</p>
<p>even if you happen to be in a monogamous relationship,</p>
<p>even if you happen to be not sexually active</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s seeking to use IVF</p>
<p>with a sperm donor or something of that sort.</p>
<p>Why would they do that?</p>
<p>Why is there so much concern about that?</p>
<p>Is it about avoiding giving birth to a child</p>
<p>that has something like a herpes infection or HIV?</p>
<p>Well, certainly that&rsquo;s one reason,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a down the line reason</p>
<p>because at the time when someone goes into the clinic</p>
<p>for one of these sperm or egg analyses,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s well in advance of any pregnancy, right?</p>
<p>The reason is there are a number of STIs</p>
<p>in particular chlamydia</p>
<p>for which it greatly increases</p>
<p>the probability of miscarriage.</p>
<p>So chlamydia is one of those very insidious</p>
<p>and cryptic STIs because a lot of people,</p>
<p>both males and females,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even realize that they have chlamydia</p>
<p>and then they can carry chlamydia</p>
<p>at the time in which they conceive</p>
<p>and then that can lead to ectopic pregnancies</p>
<p>and or miscarriages.</p>
<p>So by all means, get an STI check</p>
<p>if you are somebody who&rsquo;s seeking to conceive children</p>
<p>or evaluating your fertility generally.</p>
<p>Chlamydia can also have damaging effects</p>
<p>on the epididymis and on the various other aspects</p>
<p>of male reproductive health.</p>
<p>In the future, we will do an episode all about sexual health.</p>
<p>This is not the time for that,</p>
<p>but get an STI check if your goal</p>
<p>is to conceive a healthy child.</p>
<p>Now, the other thing that can have a very negative impact</p>
<p>on fertility and healthy pregnancy is a viral infection.</p>
<p>Now, for instance,</p>
<p>if a male has had a severe viral illness,</p>
<p>and this could be any number of different viral illnesses</p>
<p>from flu to cold or any number of different viruses,</p>
<p>pick your favorite virus,</p>
<p>in the previous 70 to 90 days,</p>
<p>that can greatly diminish the number</p>
<p>and or quality of sperm, okay?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>This is also important if you&rsquo;re going to go in</p>
<p>and do a sperm analysis and you had a viral infection</p>
<p>in the previous 70 to 90 days,</p>
<p>well, then you need to be aware of that</p>
<p>because it could greatly impact the parameters</p>
<p>of that sperm analysis.</p>
<p>Likewise, for women,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve had a serious viral infection</p>
<p>in the previous 30 days,</p>
<p>does that mean you should not try and conceive?</p>
<p>Not necessarily,</p>
<p>but you should talk to your OBGYN about that.</p>
<p>There are data showing that viral infection,</p>
<p>in particular of influenza in the mother</p>
<p>in the first trimester of pregnancy has some correlation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not 100%,</p>
<p>but some correlation with negative mental health outcomes</p>
<p>of the offspring sometime later, including schizophrenia.</p>
<p>This is some of the work that was done at Caltech</p>
<p>a number of years ago and other laboratories as well.</p>
<p>Those data are still being built up over time.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s not one for one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not causal.</p>
<p>So if you did get an influenza or a cold</p>
<p>or other kind of viral infection during the first trimester</p>
<p>or any trimester of pregnancy,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to cause alarm,</p>
<p>but you should talk to your OBGYN about this.</p>
<p>The goal of course is to avoid viral illness at any time</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trying to conceive or have a healthy pregnancy.</p>
<p>But of course, sometimes people will get ill</p>
<p>and the children can turn out to be perfectly normal</p>
<p>and fine, but it is something that you want to avoid</p>
<p>and it will impact your egg analysis</p>
<p>and it will impact sperm analysis.</p>
<p>And one thing I found really surprising</p>
<p>in researching this episode was that one in 25 men</p>
<p>carry a copy of a mutation for cystic fibrosis.</p>
<p>Now, some of you are probably familiar with cystic fibrosis</p>
<p>as a condition that can cause issues with the lungs,</p>
<p>the accumulation of fluid in the lungs or other tissues.</p>
<p>Cystic fibrosis, in order to express that way</p>
<p>of accumulation of fluid in the lungs,</p>
<p>you really need two copies, right?</p>
<p>You need two mutant copies</p>
<p>or you need two copies of the cystic fibrosis gene.</p>
<p>One in 25 men will carry just one copy</p>
<p>and therefore will not have any symptoms of cystic fibrosis.</p>
<p>But those one in 25 men will have defects</p>
<p>in the architecture of the vas deferens,</p>
<p>the duct through which the ejaculate needs to pass</p>
<p>in order to eventually be ejaculated out of the urethra.</p>
<p>And so what that means is that these men can have</p>
<p>what appears to be normal semen volume,</p>
<p>but that they won&rsquo;t have normal numbers of sperm.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not because of a deficit in making the sperm,</p>
<p>the testes can function just fine,</p>
<p>the brain and the pituitary communicating</p>
<p>with the testes just fine,</p>
<p>but that literally the passageway by which the sperm arrive</p>
<p>within the seminal fluid and are eventually ejaculated</p>
<p>is disrupted by the cystic fibrosis gene.</p>
<p>Luckily, if somebody has just one copy</p>
<p>of the cystic fibrosis gene and they&rsquo;re male,</p>
<p>and this is the issue,</p>
<p>the vas deferens either can be repaired by a urologist</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s expert in the surgical repair of vas deferens</p>
<p>or sperm can be extracted from the testicle directly,</p>
<p>which might sound like a painful procedure,</p>
<p>but I believe nowadays in talking with various experts</p>
<p>on this, turns out that it can be done</p>
<p>with a minimum of discomfort.</p>
<p>And certainly if the goal is to have a healthy child,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to need those sperm.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to want to get them one way or the other,</p>
<p>regardless of the discomfort.</p>
<p>Now, before getting into some of the things</p>
<p>that you can do in the positive sense</p>
<p>to increase your fertility,</p>
<p>we do need to touch on just a few other things</p>
<p>that you want to avoid in order to avoid</p>
<p>diminishing your fertility.</p>
<p>And this mainly relates to males,</p>
<p>but it will also be relevant to females.</p>
<p>And of course, when I say also relevant to females,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m referring to the fact that if it&rsquo;s a woman and a man</p>
<p>who are trying to conceive,</p>
<p>then she of course is going to be interested</p>
<p>in her egg quality, but also the sperm quality.</p>
<p>And of course there are women who are conceiving</p>
<p>by way of sperm donor through IVF or IUI or otherwise,</p>
<p>but in any case, the need to understand and maximize</p>
<p>the quality of both the egg and the sperm is paramount.</p>
<p>So in order for men to maximize the quality of their sperm,</p>
<p>as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>does not seem to be a big difference</p>
<p>whether or not they use boxers or briefs</p>
<p>or whether or not they, quote unquote, go commando.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t wear any boxers or briefs of any kind.</p>
<p>However, it is important to keep the testicles cool enough.</p>
<p>They need to be about two degrees cooler</p>
<p>than the rest of the body.</p>
<p>And there are a number of different ways to do that.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before,</p>
<p>avoid going in hot tubs during the period</p>
<p>in which you&rsquo;re trying to conceive children.</p>
<p>You should also avoid going in saunas during the period</p>
<p>in which you were trying to conceive children.</p>
<p>And if you do go in the sauna,</p>
<p>you can bring an ice pack there</p>
<p>and you can put it on the testicles</p>
<p>in order to offset the heat of the sauna</p>
<p>and keep the testicles cool while in the sauna.</p>
<p>The other thing that you&rsquo;ll definitely want to do</p>
<p>is avoid putting a laptop or any other hot device</p>
<p>directly onto your lap.</p>
<p>There are a number of different devices</p>
<p>that you can put on your lap.</p>
<p>You could put books or a box,</p>
<p>or there are these devices that are designed</p>
<p>to dispel the heat from the laptop.</p>
<p>I would say, if you&rsquo;re trying to conceive,</p>
<p>just keep the laptop off of your lap,</p>
<p>just put it on a table or standing desk or whatever,</p>
<p>just keep it off of your lap.</p>
<p>Also, there are some really interesting data</p>
<p>showing that the amount of time that men spent sitting,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not they sit</p>
<p>with their ankle on their opposite knee</p>
<p>or with knees spread, the classic man spread stance</p>
<p>or any other kind of seated stance</p>
<p>is going to increase the temperature of the scrotum.</p>
<p>For reasons that are somewhat obvious,</p>
<p>if you think about the architecture of all this,</p>
<p>I think both men and women,</p>
<p>if you put enough thought to it,</p>
<p>you go, oh yeah, that would increase the temperature.</p>
<p>Obviously avoid seat heaters in cars or otherwise,</p>
<p>but reducing the total amount of time that you spend seated</p>
<p>is really important if you want to keep</p>
<p>the temperature milieu of the scrotum optimal</p>
<p>for sperm quality and fertilization.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be important to make sure that your legs</p>
<p>are not really big to the point where they are creating</p>
<p>a hotter than is healthy environment</p>
<p>for the scrotum and testicles.</p>
<p>So a hotter than normal environment for the testicles</p>
<p>can be caused by legs that are very large,</p>
<p>upper thighs that are very large due to obesity</p>
<p>or due to those upper thighs being too muscular.</p>
<p>So by all means, don&rsquo;t skip leg day,</p>
<p>but be aware that if you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s trying to conceive,</p>
<p>you want to do whatever you can</p>
<p>to reduce the temperature of the scrotum,</p>
<p>or at least not let it get too hot for too long, okay?</p>
<p>So I can think of all sorts of reasons now</p>
<p>that men are going to come up with</p>
<p>to do the man spread stance of their knees really far apart,</p>
<p>even further if they have large legs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a discussion we want to have here.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not really what today&rsquo;s discussion is about.</p>
<p>Really the principle is what&rsquo;s most important,</p>
<p>which is to keep the temperature of the scrotum</p>
<p>and testicles lower than the rest of your body.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a direct blood flow from the body to the testicle</p>
<p>that provides blood flow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s designed in a way that that blood pathway</p>
<p>should be outside the body</p>
<p>and as far away from the body as possible</p>
<p>in order to get the temperature milieu</p>
<p>of the scrotum and testicle correct</p>
<p>for healthy sperm quality.</p>
<p>Now, a topic that is sure to be a bit controversial,</p>
<p>but it really shouldn&rsquo;t be because the data,</p>
<p>at least to me, are very clear,</p>
<p>is this issue of phone use and sperm quality.</p>
<p>Now, this can open up a whole array of issues</p>
<p>related to things like EMFs,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got people out there that have, you know,</p>
<p>ideas about 5G and all of this stuff.</p>
<p>That is not what this discussion is about.</p>
<p>The discussion I&rsquo;m about to have with you</p>
<p>relates to the fact that the electromagnetic fields</p>
<p>and the heat-related effects of smartphones</p>
<p>can indeed have a detrimental effect on sperm quality.</p>
<p>And yes, indeed, on testosterone levels as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to refer you to a paper.</p>
<p>We will link it in the show note captions.</p>
<p>The title of this paper is</p>
<p>Effects of Mobile Phone Usage on Sperm Quality.</p>
<p>No Time-Dependent Relationship on Usage.</p>
<p>A Systematic Review and Updated Meta-Analysis.</p>
<p>This is a paper that came out in 2021</p>
<p>and talks about the fact that phones</p>
<p>emit a radio frequency electromagnetic waves,</p>
<p>which are called RF radio frequency,</p>
<p>EMWs, electromagnetic waves,</p>
<p>at a low level between 80 and 2,200 megahertz</p>
<p>that can be absorbed by the human body.</p>
<p>We know this, okay, this is not controversial,</p>
<p>and have potential adverse effects on brain, heart,</p>
<p>endocrine system, and reproductive function.</p>
<p>That has been established.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, there is basically no controversy</p>
<p>that radio frequency waves and EMFs</p>
<p>can have a negative impact on biological tissues.</p>
<p>The question is how intense</p>
<p>are those radio frequency waves and EMFs,</p>
<p>and how detrimental are those on those biological tissues?</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s a matter of degrees,</p>
<p>but there is very little controversy</p>
<p>as to whether or not they have an effect</p>
<p>on biological tissues,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m aware of absolutely zero data</p>
<p>showing that they can have a positive effect</p>
<p>on biological tissues.</p>
<p>Since what we&rsquo;re mainly talking about now are smartphones,</p>
<p>we want to separate out the heat effects of smartphones</p>
<p>from the EMFs related to the fact</p>
<p>that they are Wi-Fi smartphones,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re using cellular towers and Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>One or the other combination.</p>
<p>Okay, so there are a number of different things</p>
<p>in the phone that could be detrimental.</p>
<p>We need to separate those out.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, because you might have heard</p>
<p>that carrying your phone in your pocket</p>
<p>can reduce your testosterone levels and sperm count,</p>
<p>and guess what?</p>
<p>That is true.</p>
<p>The data contained within this meta-analysis</p>
<p>and other meta-analyses clearly point out</p>
<p>that it can reduce sperm count</p>
<p>and maybe testosterone levels significantly,</p>
<p>but certainly sperm count and motility significantly.</p>
<p>It reduces sperm quality.</p>
<p>So should you avoid putting your phone in your pocket?</p>
<p>Certainly your front pocket, I would suggest yes, right?</p>
<p>If you are somebody who is seeking to conceive, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not somebody who is going to stop using my smartphone.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect anyone&rsquo;s going to stop using their smartphone.</p>
<p>The question is, should you carry it in your front pocket</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a male?</p>
<p>I think to be on the safe side,</p>
<p>the answer is probably avoid doing that too much of the time.</p>
<p>Ideally, don&rsquo;t do it at all.</p>
<p>Then people will say, well, what if I turn off the Wi-Fi</p>
<p>or I turn off the cellular access,</p>
<p>then is it still a problem?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a problem due to the heat-related effects.</p>
<p>And then people say, well,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually feel the heat of the phone.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t get that warm,</p>
<p>but the temperature effects of the phone, it turns out,</p>
<p>are enough, even under conditions</p>
<p>in which people don&rsquo;t report it to be uncomfortably warm,</p>
<p>that it can change the temperature milieu of the testicle</p>
<p>in ways that can diminish sperm quality.</p>
<p>How much and how that relates to fertility</p>
<p>and healthy pregnancy, not clear,</p>
<p>but since we&rsquo;re talking about things to avoid,</p>
<p>if your goal is to have a healthy fertilization</p>
<p>in pregnancy, well then, by all means,</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t carry it in your front pocket.</p>
<p>Then people say, well, what about back pocket</p>
<p>or what about backpack?</p>
<p>Look, it&rsquo;s very clear that avoiding being too close</p>
<p>to the phone is probably better for your sperm quality</p>
<p>than putting the phone very close to your testicles</p>
<p>or anywhere else on your body,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also the reality that most people</p>
<p>are going to carry a phone nowadays, all right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the reality.</p>
<p>I think the current estimates and it&rsquo;s discussed</p>
<p>in this paper that 90% of the human population</p>
<p>has a smartphone, 90%, which is incredible,</p>
<p>the adult population, of course,</p>
<p>although a lot of kids have them as well.</p>
<p>So this paper goes on to detail a number</p>
<p>of different studies and outcomes from studies,</p>
<p>but basically what they find, and here I&rsquo;m paraphrasing,</p>
<p>is that the data indicate that sperm quality declines</p>
<p>when people start using a mobile phone.</p>
<p>So from the point they start using a mobile phone,</p>
<p>regardless of the usage time, this is important.</p>
<p>It used to be thought that it was four hours a day</p>
<p>or more of holding your phone or having that phone</p>
<p>close to your body was going to diminish sperm quality.</p>
<p>It turns out that it&rsquo;s not related to usage time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s even the title of the paper.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the fact that people are using mobile phones</p>
<p>is reducing sperm count and quality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reality.</p>
<p>Is it entirely responsible for all the reductions</p>
<p>in sperm quality and maybe even the reductions</p>
<p>in testosterone levels that we&rsquo;re observing</p>
<p>from decade to decade going forward?</p>
<p>I doubt that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>Is it likely to be one of the major players?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got my bet on the fact that it is</p>
<p>based on the data that I&rsquo;ve observed.</p>
<p>And so if any of you would like to peruse the data</p>
<p>in this meta-analysis, they&rsquo;re quite good.</p>
<p>This study looked at 18 studies that include 4,280 samples.</p>
<p>They were able to separate out the radio frequency</p>
<p>versus the heat effects, and they were able to eliminate</p>
<p>this time of usage variable that previously we thought</p>
<p>if you were exposed to a lot of cell phone contact</p>
<p>that it was far worse than if you were exposed</p>
<p>to a little bit.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re exposed to any at all,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to diminish sperm quality.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Does that mean that no matter what you do,</p>
<p>if you own a smartphone,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to diminish sperm quality?</p>
<p>I think the short answer is yes,</p>
<p>but that you can mitigate it.</p>
<p>What might you do?</p>
<p>Well, keeping your phone away from your groin</p>
<p>or as far from your groin as possible,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a male who&rsquo;s wishing to conceive,</p>
<p>and maybe even a male who&rsquo;s wishing to maximize</p>
<p>his testosterone levels, because it does appear</p>
<p>that radio frequency waves and the heat from the phone,</p>
<p>so both of those factors independently and together,</p>
<p>of course, can disrupt the Leydig cells of the testes</p>
<p>and the production of testosterone</p>
<p>and intratesticular testosterone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important for sperm production.</p>
<p>The exact biological variables leading to all these changes</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t exactly clear, but if you&rsquo;re like me, you say, okay,</p>
<p>probably not a problem for most males to carry their phone,</p>
<p>but probably best to not carry it in the front pocket,</p>
<p>maybe even avoid carrying the back pocket as well.</p>
<p>Again, in the future,</p>
<p>we will have an episode all about Bluetooth.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about various aspects of EMFs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a super interesting dataset,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a dataset for which there&rsquo;s a ton of controversy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting, however,</p>
<p>and there are more and more quality data</p>
<p>coming out all the time, and I think going forward,</p>
<p>we are going to see that, indeed,</p>
<p>there are some negative effects of smartphones</p>
<p>related to both their radio frequency transmission</p>
<p>and the fact that they generate heat,</p>
<p>and in general, heat is not good for biological tissues.</p>
<p>So any discussion about heat and sperm</p>
<p>and how heat is detrimental to sperm</p>
<p>has to raise this issue of whether or not cold</p>
<p>is good for the testicle.</p>
<p>Okay, well, now there&rsquo;s a lot of data starting to come out</p>
<p>about the positive effects,</p>
<p>the positive biological effects of deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>on different aspects of brain biology,</p>
<p>such as the release of dopamine and norepinephrine,</p>
<p>and on the biology of the body, to some extent metabolism,</p>
<p>but more so the impact on brown fat stores,</p>
<p>which are good for us, so-called brown fat thermogenesis.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot related to deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve done entire episodes on deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>Again, you can find that at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>We did a guest episode with an expert</p>
<p>on the use of cold for health and performance</p>
<p>with my colleague, Craig Heller</p>
<p>from Stanford Department of Biology.</p>
<p>We also have a toolkit on how to apply</p>
<p>deliberate cold exposure for health</p>
<p>for both females and for males,</p>
<p>for sports performance, cognitive performance,</p>
<p>mood, sleep, et cetera.</p>
<p>You can find all that, again, hubermanlab.com,</p>
<p>totally zero cost.</p>
<p>Go into the menu, go to newsletter and scroll down,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll find those.</p>
<p>When thinking about sperm quality,</p>
<p>we want to remember that excessive heat is bad.</p>
<p>Now, does that mean that deliberate cold is good?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that one of the major causes</p>
<p>of lowered sperm count and overall reduced sperm quality</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s quite common is the presence</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s called a varicella.</p>
<p>A varicella is kind of like varicose veins</p>
<p>of the veins that innervate the testicle.</p>
<p>What it essentially does is it means that blood will pool</p>
<p>in the testicular region.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t circulate back to the body quickly enough,</p>
<p>and therefore the temperature of that environment increases.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some other things that varicellas do</p>
<p>which can be obstructive at the physical level,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re not just temperature related.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear that using deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>can be healthy for the sperm because of the ways</p>
<p>not that cold directly supports testosterone</p>
<p>or sperm quality, but rather because cold reduces heat.</p>
<p>Okay, so you will find available online,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re actually called,</p>
<p>forgive me, but that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re called.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t name them called snowballs.</p>
<p>These are, they&rsquo;re sort of like gel pack cold briefs</p>
<p>that you can buy and men will wear for some period of time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you wear them all day.</p>
<p>You wear them for some period of time.</p>
<p>A lot of people are now using cold showers and ice baths</p>
<p>and circulating cold baths</p>
<p>or going into a cold ocean or lake</p>
<p>for any number of different reasons I talked about earlier.</p>
<p>I myself start every day</p>
<p>with either a one to three minute cold shower</p>
<p>or one to three minute immersion up to my neck</p>
<p>in a cold bath, cold water,</p>
<p>circulating water or a cold shower.</p>
<p>I do that mainly for the psychological effects</p>
<p>related to the long lasting increases</p>
<p>in dopamine and epinephrine,</p>
<p>but there are other data starting to come out</p>
<p>showing that that sort of approach or similar approaches</p>
<p>can increase testosterone levels</p>
<p>and maybe even sperm counts</p>
<p>can reduce cortisol late in the evening</p>
<p>if the cold exposure is done early in the day,</p>
<p>so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So a lot of interesting data coming out</p>
<p>in really good journals that are peer reviewed</p>
<p>and so on in humans.</p>
<p>I should mention those studies are done in humans</p>
<p>to support the use of deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>But again, if you&rsquo;re going to use deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>to improve sperm quality, can it work?</p>
<p>Yes, indeed it can work,</p>
<p>either indirectly by increasing testosterone</p>
<p>or directly by improving sperm quality,</p>
<p>but both of those effects are likely to be indirect</p>
<p>by virtue of reducing the temperature</p>
<p>of the testicle overall,</p>
<p>not because there&rsquo;s any sort of magic effect of cold</p>
<p>on the testicle.</p>
<p>Now, I have to imagine that a number of you,</p>
<p>in particular, the females listening to this,</p>
<p>are going to say, is deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>and for that matter, is deliberate heat exposure,</p>
<p>like sauna or hot tub, good or bad for the ovary,</p>
<p>for eggs and for fertility?</p>
<p>Now, there are fewer data to look to, unfortunately,</p>
<p>but what we do know is that deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>done in the way that I just described,</p>
<p>one to three minutes a day, ideally early in the day</p>
<p>through cold shower or immersion up to the neck,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to be an ice bath,</p>
<p>could be cold circulating water</p>
<p>or even non-circulating cold water.</p>
<p>And people will say, well, how cold?</p>
<p>I should have mentioned that before.</p>
<p>How cold?</p>
<p>There is no way I can tell you</p>
<p>exactly how cold the water should be</p>
<p>because for some people,</p>
<p>60 degrees Fahrenheit will be exceedingly cold.</p>
<p>For other people, 40 degrees is going to be more appropriate.</p>
<p>How cold should you make it?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to embrace these practices,</p>
<p>you want to, according to the literature,</p>
<p>what you want to do is make it uncomfortably cold,</p>
<p>such that you really want to get out, but safe, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to go into 30 degree water immediately.</p>
<p>You can actually have a heart attack and die if you do that.</p>
<p>So you want to progress gradually into the cold.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to shock your system too much,</p>
<p>although it is the adrenaline evoked by that,</p>
<p>that quickening or shortening or elimination of the breath</p>
<p>for a short period of time</p>
<p>when you get into uncomfortably cold water</p>
<p>that correlates with, or is actually the reflection of,</p>
<p>would be more accurate to say the release of adrenaline</p>
<p>and then dopamine and so forth,</p>
<p>which has been very well documented.</p>
<p>So uncomfortably cold, but safe to stay in.</p>
<p>And I cannot tell you an exact number</p>
<p>that is uncomfortably cold, but safe for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to differ person by person.</p>
<p>You want to figure that out,</p>
<p>just like I can&rsquo;t tell you how much weight</p>
<p>that you should squat in order to achieve</p>
<p>some effective resistance training for the legs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to differ depending on your strength</p>
<p>and your prior experience and so forth.</p>
<p>So ease into it, be safe.</p>
<p>But it does appear that both for men,</p>
<p>for reasons I talked about a few minutes ago,</p>
<p>and for women, that deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>can be beneficial for fertility and for hormone production,</p>
<p>but in particular for females</p>
<p>in terms of regulating cortisol and for hormone production.</p>
<p>Now you might say, okay, getting into cold is stressful.</p>
<p>How can that be helpful for regulating stress?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out when you get into the cold,</p>
<p>you get a big surge in adrenaline and then dopamine,</p>
<p>which is very long lasting,</p>
<p>provided that&rsquo;s done in the early part of the day.</p>
<p>So I would say, you know, not too close to sleep.</p>
<p>Then what you do is you restrict</p>
<p>your maximum cortisol release to a period earlier in the day</p>
<p>that buffers, reduces, that is the likelihood</p>
<p>that you would have excessive amounts of cortisol</p>
<p>later in the day, which not only can disrupt sleep,</p>
<p>but is correlated with a number of other hormonal effects</p>
<p>that are not good for us</p>
<p>and therefore not good for fertility.</p>
<p>So here, what I&rsquo;m describing are positive</p>
<p>yet indirect effects of a cold on hormone levels,</p>
<p>both in males and in females.</p>
<p>So for men, we talked about increased testosterone,</p>
<p>improved sperm quality that was indirect, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re reducing the temperature of the testicle,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not that cold itself</p>
<p>is positively impacting those things.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Heat is bad, therefore reducing temperature is good.</p>
<p>Likewise with females, deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>can be good for the overall fertility process,</p>
<p>not because cold is good for the ovary</p>
<p>or being cold is good for the ovary</p>
<p>or for luteinizing hormone or for follicle-stimulating hormone</p>
<p>or anything else like that,</p>
<p>but rather that using deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>as a way to restrict stress in a deliberate way</p>
<p>to a particular time of day</p>
<p>increases the release of cortisol then</p>
<p>and indirectly reduces the amount of cortisol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s released at other times along the 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>Okay, so these are positive yet indirect effects.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a woman who really is interested</p>
<p>in exploring deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>or who enjoys it or is already doing it</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re wishing to conceive, great, explore it,</p>
<p>do it safely, of course,</p>
<p>but explore it and continue to do it.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re somebody who just hates the cold</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t want to go anywhere near it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no reason to think that you absolutely need it</p>
<p>provided that your stress, your sleep,</p>
<p>and other factors are all being carried out properly.</p>
<p>The next things that we&rsquo;ll talk about</p>
<p>in terms of positive things or things that we can do</p>
<p>in order to maximize fertility for both females and males</p>
<p>are the things that you also generally hear about elsewhere.</p>
<p>Right along with sleep and avoiding alcohol</p>
<p>and avoiding nicotine and avoiding cannabis,</p>
<p>avoiding excessive heat for the testicle,</p>
<p>avoiding excessive stress,</p>
<p>is that you want to try to get enough exercise, right?</p>
<p>Why would exercise have anything to do with any of this?</p>
<p>Well, exercise, and that is both a combination</p>
<p>of resistance training and cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>is going to improve the health of the mitochondria,</p>
<p>in particular, cardiovascular exercise.</p>
<p>And I realized that for you fitness experts out there,</p>
<p>anytime someone says cardio,</p>
<p>people kind of roll their eyes like, what is that?</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s endurance training,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s interval training, there&rsquo;s HIIT training,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s sprints, there&rsquo;s all sorts of different things.</p>
<p>Some of those overlap, some of them are separate.</p>
<p>Indeed, that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>But we can use a general rule of thumb here,</p>
<p>which is that for most people getting anywhere from 30</p>
<p>and ideally 45 to 60 minutes of exercise per day</p>
<p>for six days per week, maybe even seven,</p>
<p>but most people like to take a day off</p>
<p>or need to take a complete day off each week.</p>
<p>Six to seven days per week is going to be good</p>
<p>for mitochondrial health and function.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also going to impact all the other things</p>
<p>like quality sleep, mood, reducing stress,</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So exercise we can handle pretty quickly</p>
<p>by just saying everyone should be doing it.</p>
<p>Now, when people are pregnant,</p>
<p>they might have to, of course,</p>
<p>change the amount of exercise</p>
<p>or the type of exercise that they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>There are varying opinions on that,</p>
<p>but certainly the type of exercise</p>
<p>and the amount can vary when people are pregnant.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re seeking to conceive,</p>
<p>getting enough exercise is good</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s good for the mitochondria.</p>
<p>The mitochondria are present in that mid region of the sperm</p>
<p>and mitochondria are critical for chromosomal segregation</p>
<p>and the spindle and other aspects</p>
<p>of the formation of a healthy egg,</p>
<p>ovulation and fertilization in the female.</p>
<p>One thing that I know a lot of people</p>
<p>are interested in nowadays is so-called intermittent fasting</p>
<p>or time-restricted feeding.</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s be fair.</p>
<p>Everybody is restricting their feeding time</p>
<p>because hopefully everybody is sleeping</p>
<p>at some point in the 24-hour cycle</p>
<p>and nobody&rsquo;s eating while they are sleeping.</p>
<p>That said, many people are employing</p>
<p>a so-called eight-hour feeding window</p>
<p>or a 10-hour feeding window or a 12-hour feeding window.</p>
<p>And indeed, there are some data to support the idea</p>
<p>that that can be a good thing</p>
<p>for a number of different biological and health parameters.</p>
<p>However, also a lot of data,</p>
<p>especially recently pointed to the fact</p>
<p>that your overall number of calories</p>
<p>and the quality of your food sources</p>
<p>is going to be the most important variable.</p>
<p>And some people simply find that time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>intermittent fasting, as it&rsquo;s also called,</p>
<p>is just a convenient way to ensure</p>
<p>that your total intake of calories</p>
<p>is not excessive for what you need.</p>
<p>Now, with all that said,</p>
<p>there is evidence that I&rsquo;ve covered in a solo episode</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll soon have an expert guest on</p>
<p>showing that time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>can have certain positive outcomes</p>
<p>for various aspects of organ, cellar, and tissue health.</p>
<p>Okay, this is somewhat controversial,</p>
<p>but there is growing evidence</p>
<p>that by restricting your feeding window</p>
<p>to say eight hours or 10 hours or 12 hours,</p>
<p>that it is better than if you were to eat</p>
<p>over a longer period of each 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>But again, the data are still incoming.</p>
<p>The reason we want to talk about</p>
<p>time-restricted feeding, intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>is that a lot of people do use it</p>
<p>because they find it easier to not eat</p>
<p>at certain periods of their 24-hour cycle</p>
<p>than to restrict calories.</p>
<p>But again, keep in mind,</p>
<p>you have to restrict calories</p>
<p>if your goal is to maintain or lose weight, all right?</p>
<p>A discussion that we&rsquo;ve covered</p>
<p>in that episode on intermittent fasting</p>
<p>and in the episode with Dr. Lane Norton</p>
<p>and that we will cover in other episodes in the future.</p>
<p>So refer to those episodes at hubermanlab.com</p>
<p>if you would like to learn more</p>
<p>about intermittent fasting per se.</p>
<p>For sake of this conversation,</p>
<p>a number of people are probably asking,</p>
<p>if I restrict my feeding to a certain window each 24 hours,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s convenient</p>
<p>or because I&rsquo;m excited about the potential</p>
<p>positive effects of intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>is that going to disrupt the likelihood of fertility</p>
<p>and thereby a healthy pregnancy?</p>
<p>And the short answer to that is if you are a female</p>
<p>and you are having regular menstrual cycles,</p>
<p>that is a fairly consistent duration,</p>
<p>so maybe it&rsquo;s 21 days, maybe it&rsquo;s 35 or anywhere in between,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s fairly consistent from month to month,</p>
<p>and you are following intermittent fasting</p>
<p>time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>well then chances are pretty good</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not disrupting your fertility</p>
<p>and likelihood of fertilization in a healthy pregnancy.</p>
<p>Of course, during pregnancy,</p>
<p>you need to talk to your doctor</p>
<p>and make sure that you&rsquo;re eating in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s supportive both of you and of the developing fetus,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s extremely important.</p>
<p>I am not aware of data exploring in a regimented way</p>
<p>time-restricted feeding during pregnancy, okay?</p>
<p>So please, please, please, if you&rsquo;re pregnant,</p>
<p>do not jump on a time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>so-called intermittent fasting diet.</p>
<p>Talk to your OBGYN, talk to your doctor,</p>
<p>talk to multiple doctors for that matter</p>
<p>before doing anything like that</p>
<p>because of course you&rsquo;re now eating for two</p>
<p>or if you have twins in there, you&rsquo;re eating for three.</p>
<p>And very important.</p>
<p>If however, you&rsquo;re not yet pregnant</p>
<p>and you want to be fertile, get pregnant,</p>
<p>or simply maintain a fertile potential in biology,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re following intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be the regularity of those periods</p>
<p>and regularity of cycle length</p>
<p>that will tell you whether or not that&rsquo;s a good idea or not.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind, of course,</p>
<p>that if your total number of calories is too low,</p>
<p>your periods will cease.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a well-known effect.</p>
<p>But of course, stress can also induce</p>
<p>cessation of menstruation.</p>
<p>And there are other factors that can induce</p>
<p>cessation of menstruation as well.</p>
<p>Some of them start with changes in the brain,</p>
<p>literally in the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>some occur in the pituitary.</p>
<p>Many of the lifestyle factors can do that,</p>
<p>but most typically it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>excessive caloric restriction</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s going to be a caloric deficit</p>
<p>brought on by excess physical activity.</p>
<p>So even if someone&rsquo;s eating a lot,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re not eating enough</p>
<p>to offset their physical activity</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re not eating enough of in particular fats,</p>
<p>the essential fatty acids and protein,</p>
<p>but also carbohydrates,</p>
<p>well then menstruation can cease.</p>
<p>And of course, if menstruation is ceasing,</p>
<p>chances are almost with certainty</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not getting regular ovulations.</p>
<p>Now, in terms of males</p>
<p>and whether or not intermittent fasting</p>
<p>is going to disrupt somatogenesis</p>
<p>and testosterone production,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s essentially no data we can look to,</p>
<p>but we can look to the general logic</p>
<p>around the relationship</p>
<p>between body fat, testosterone, and somatogenesis.</p>
<p>And this was something that was covered</p>
<p>in a discussion I had on</p>
<p>optimization of hormone health for males</p>
<p>that I had with Dr. Kyle Gillette,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a medical doctor and obesity specialist.</p>
<p>Again, you can find that episode at hubermanlab.com</p>
<p>if you want to learn all about hormone optimization in males.</p>
<p>And essentially the story is as follows.</p>
<p>If a male is excessively overweight,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s carrying too much body fat in particular,</p>
<p>not too much muscle,</p>
<p>although that can be an issue too,</p>
<p>but too much body fat is typically the issue.</p>
<p>So, you know, more than say 20% body fat,</p>
<p>well then losing body fat</p>
<p>is going to be the primary goal</p>
<p>for maximizing testosterone,</p>
<p>sperm health, and spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>If however, a male is already lean,</p>
<p>well then actually increasing calories</p>
<p>will increase testosterone.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a bit of a complicated story,</p>
<p>although not so complicated</p>
<p>that none of us can understand it.</p>
<p>Basically, if you&rsquo;re overweight,</p>
<p>you should focus on losing weight</p>
<p>in order to maximize sperm quality and health.</p>
<p>If you are very lean,</p>
<p>well then restricting your calories</p>
<p>to the point where you are starting to lose weight</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re dropping even more body fat</p>
<p>is unlikely to increase your testosterone further, right?</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean it&rsquo;s bad</p>
<p>or that you shouldn&rsquo;t try and go,</p>
<p>for instance, from 15% to 10% body fat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that that&rsquo;s bad</p>
<p>and that will reduce your testosterone,</p>
<p>but in general, if you&rsquo;re already very lean,</p>
<p>so, you know, 10% body fat, 5% body fat,</p>
<p>and you start restricting calories further,</p>
<p>your testosterone levels will drop.</p>
<p>So in the context of intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really not an issue</p>
<p>of whether or not your feeding window</p>
<p>is eight hours or 12 hours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really an issue</p>
<p>of whether or not you&rsquo;re getting enough calories</p>
<p>to offset the physical demands and activities of your life,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re on a maintenance diet</p>
<p>to maintain your weight.</p>
<p>And of course, you have to put all that in the context</p>
<p>of whether or not you&rsquo;re overweight or lean to begin with.</p>
<p>The simple thing to take away from this</p>
<p>is if you&rsquo;re a male who&rsquo;s using, because you like it,</p>
<p>intermittent fasting, so-called time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re following an eight-hour</p>
<p>or maybe even a one-meal-per-day type approach,</p>
<p>although I don&rsquo;t really recommend that</p>
<p>for a number of reasons we could talk about separately.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re eating over the course</p>
<p>of eight or 10 or 12 hours per day,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what works for you,</p>
<p>and you are ingesting enough calories</p>
<p>to maintain your weight if you&rsquo;re already lean,</p>
<p>or you are ingesting fewer calories</p>
<p>than you are burning in order to lose weight</p>
<p>because you are already overweight</p>
<p>and you want to lose body fat,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably optimizing for all the things</p>
<p>that you need to do in order to improve sperm quality</p>
<p>and testosterone levels.</p>
<p>Now, also in that episode that I did with Dr. Kyle Gillette</p>
<p>on optimizing hormones for males,</p>
<p>we talked about testosterone replacement therapy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a topic I want to get into in any detail right now,</p>
<p>but I will say this.</p>
<p>Remember earlier when we were talking about spermatogenesis</p>
<p>and the fact that in order for sperm to be generated</p>
<p>consistently every month ongoing from the time of puberty</p>
<p>until essentially the time that a man dies,</p>
<p>you need two things.</p>
<p>You need testosterone production</p>
<p>from the Leydig cells of the testes,</p>
<p>and you need spermatogenesis to be supported</p>
<p>by that androgen binding protein</p>
<p>coming from the support cells from the Sertoli cells.</p>
<p>So you need testosterone</p>
<p>and you need androgen binding protein,</p>
<p>and you need the Leydig cells and the Sertoli cells active.</p>
<p>When men take exogenous,</p>
<p>meaning from outside the body testosterone,</p>
<p>either by cream or by patch or by pellets,</p>
<p>or more typically by injection,</p>
<p>the most typical TRT approach nowadays</p>
<p>is testosterone cypionate,</p>
<p>which is biologically identical</p>
<p>to the kind of testosterone you would make.</p>
<p>Well, because of negative feedback loops,</p>
<p>which you also learned about earlier,</p>
<p>the testicles themselves shut down</p>
<p>their own testosterone production.</p>
<p>Why would that be?</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re taking testosterone in by syringe</p>
<p>or by patch or any other method.</p>
<p>So the circulating testosterone</p>
<p>and the amount that arrives at the testicle</p>
<p>is going to be hopefully clinically appropriate,</p>
<p>not super physiological,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;ll be somewhere in the healthy reference range,</p>
<p>maybe a little bit higher.</p>
<p>Nowadays, some people are going a little bit higher.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not talking about full-blown</p>
<p>quote-unquote anabolic steroid use,</p>
<p>keeping in mind, of course, that estrogen is a steroid,</p>
<p>testosterone is a steroid,</p>
<p>but when we think about steroids,</p>
<p>we mean like performance-enhancing drugs,</p>
<p>so super physiological doses.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about within physiological</p>
<p>or near physiological ranges.</p>
<p>So if someone&rsquo;s taking their testosterone in</p>
<p>from an outside exogenous source,</p>
<p>the levels of circulating testosterone</p>
<p>will be sufficiently high</p>
<p>that the pituitary will register that</p>
<p>and will stop making luteinizing hormone</p>
<p>and generally follicle-stimulating hormone as well.</p>
<p>And as a consequence,</p>
<p>spermatogenesis is vastly reduced or eliminated.</p>
<p>In other words, for men who are on TRT</p>
<p>or who are taking testosterone from an external source,</p>
<p>the number of sperm that they&rsquo;re going to make</p>
<p>is going to be dramatically reduced.</p>
<p>There are things that they can do to offset that,</p>
<p>like taking HCG, human chorionic gonadotropin,</p>
<p>which is just kind of a mimic for luteinizing hormone</p>
<p>to stimulate the testes to continue to make testosterone.</p>
<p>And some men will also, or instead,</p>
<p>take FSH to stimulate the Sertoli cells</p>
<p>to support spermatogenesis, excuse me,</p>
<p>or both, or some combination.</p>
<p>Some people take clomiphene, clomid.</p>
<p>There are any number of different ways to bypass</p>
<p>or offset the sperm-reducing effects</p>
<p>of taking exogenous testosterone.</p>
<p>This is a conversation that was covered</p>
<p>in a fair amount of detail in that episode with Dr. Gillette,</p>
<p>but just keep in mind that if you are taking testosterone</p>
<p>from an exogenous source,</p>
<p>your sperm counts will dramatically be reduced</p>
<p>unless you do something to offset it.</p>
<p>So if you are wishing to conceive,</p>
<p>you need to think about whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to offset the testosterone replacement therapy</p>
<p>or whether or not you&rsquo;re going to come off it entirely.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll need to talk to a urologist</p>
<p>and a chronologist about that.</p>
<p>And again, a number of these different themes</p>
<p>and ways to go about tapering off TRT</p>
<p>were covered in that episode with Dr. Cal Gillette.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re on TRT or you&rsquo;re considering taking it</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re interested in having children, not just now,</p>
<p>but at any point,</p>
<p>you really want to take these things into consideration.</p>
<p>Now, I do want to point out</p>
<p>that for the number of you out there</p>
<p>who are taking supplements,</p>
<p>some of which we&rsquo;ve talked about on this podcast,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about on other podcasts,</p>
<p>such as Tonga Ali.</p>
<p>It turns out that there are a lot of men and women</p>
<p>taking Tonga Ali to reduce sex hormone-binding globulin</p>
<p>levels to increase testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>in some cases, libido and so forth.</p>
<p>Those approaches, meaning supplement-based approaches</p>
<p>to increase testosterone or free testosterone</p>
<p>or some related hormones</p>
<p>are not going to shut down</p>
<p>your own endogenous testosterone production</p>
<p>and reduce the number of sperm that you make.</p>
<p>Or at least as far as we know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to disrupt ovulation in any kind of way,</p>
<p>provided that the dosages are within normal ranges.</p>
<p>Again, supplementation to support your hormones</p>
<p>should not disrupt ovulation or spermatogenesis</p>
<p>or testosterone production.</p>
<p>Quite the opposite, it should enhance it.</p>
<p>What I just described around TRT</p>
<p>is taking exogenous testosterone,</p>
<p>and that itself is an entirely different beast.</p>
<p>Now, with all of that said,</p>
<p>there are some supplements out there</p>
<p>that include testosterone as a ingredient</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been snuck in to various formulas</p>
<p>that include blends and things of that sort.</p>
<p>You want to be aware of that.</p>
<p>And we did an episode about how to develop</p>
<p>a rational guide to supplementation.</p>
<p>I highly recommend listening to that episode.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s timestamped, available free</p>
<p>at hubermanlab.com in all formats,</p>
<p>because it talks about which supplements</p>
<p>are likely to be clean, quote unquote,</p>
<p>to contain the things that you expect them to contain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more and more evidence coming out</p>
<p>that a lot of supplements, including some, for instance,</p>
<p>supplements that contain testicle</p>
<p>or the extracts of testicles can contain testosterone.</p>
<p>Whether or not that can shut down</p>
<p>your own endogenous testosterone production isn&rsquo;t clear.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s really explored that in detail.</p>
<p>But based on everything we just talked about with TRT,</p>
<p>it stands to reason that it might either reduce it</p>
<p>or shut it down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just never been explored yet.</p>
<p>So by all means, make sure that you know</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re taking if you&rsquo;re taking supplements.</p>
<p>But again, the major point here</p>
<p>is that for both females and males,</p>
<p>taking supplements to support healthy hormone production,</p>
<p>including things like Tonga Ali,</p>
<p>is not the same as taking hormones or bioidentical hormones,</p>
<p>which indeed can shut down</p>
<p>your own endogenous production of hormones</p>
<p>and thereby reduce both egg quality</p>
<p>and the chance of fertilization and healthy pregnancy</p>
<p>and sperm quality and the chance of fertilization</p>
<p>and healthy pregnancy.</p>
<p>Anytime there&rsquo;s a discussion about fertility and pregnancy,</p>
<p>there seems to also be a parallel discussion</p>
<p>about sex determination.</p>
<p>That is, what factors can influence</p>
<p>whether or not the child that&rsquo;s born is male or female?</p>
<p>That is, whether or not it has double X chromosomes,</p>
<p>so one X chromosome from mom, one X chromosome from dad,</p>
<p>because the egg was fertilized by a sperm</p>
<p>that had an X sex chromosome, that 23rd chromosome,</p>
<p>or whether or not the offspring is male,</p>
<p>whether or not it has the X chromosome from mom,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s always going to be the X chromosome in that egg</p>
<p>and a Y chromosome from the sperm</p>
<p>that fertilized that particular egg.</p>
<p>Now, of course, there are instances out there</p>
<p>of people that have XXY chromosomes or XYY chromosomes,</p>
<p>but the vast majority of people out there</p>
<p>are going to have either an XX chromosome,</p>
<p>so we call that a female karyotype, right?</p>
<p>This is different than genotype and phenotype,</p>
<p>but a female karyotype would be XX</p>
<p>or a male karyotype, which would be XY, okay?</p>
<p>Now, despite the fact that it is the egg and the sperm</p>
<p>and the chromosomes that they carry</p>
<p>that are going to determine the chromosomes,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of lore and discussion</p>
<p>about the factors that can bias</p>
<p>which sperm will fertilize the egg,</p>
<p>and thereby whether or not you&rsquo;re going to get an XX,</p>
<p>female, or an XY, male chromosome, and therefore offspring.</p>
<p>Now, not only is the lore around this whole issue</p>
<p>of sex determination rather prominent,</p>
<p>but it is also somewhat unusual</p>
<p>and perhaps even interesting.</p>
<p>So for instance, Aristotle himself proposed</p>
<p>that if a man is thinking about himself and his own pleasure</p>
<p>more than his partner and her pleasure</p>
<p>at the point of ejaculation,</p>
<p>then the offspring will be male.</p>
<p>Aristotle also asserted that if a man is thinking more</p>
<p>about his partner and her pleasure</p>
<p>at the point in which he ejaculates,</p>
<p>well, then the offspring would be female.</p>
<p>Of course, we have zero reason to believe</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s any truth to Aristotle&rsquo;s theory.</p>
<p>There are no data to support that.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m not even sure how you would run that experiment</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t really look at people&rsquo;s thoughts.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to rely on honest self-report.</p>
<p>And even if people were to faithfully report</p>
<p>what they were thinking about at the moment of ejaculation,</p>
<p>this would involve, of course,</p>
<p>bringing people into the laboratory</p>
<p>and somehow measuring or analyzing their thoughts</p>
<p>or gathering their thoughts during the sexual intercourse</p>
<p>at the point of ejaculation,</p>
<p>then figuring out which biological sex</p>
<p>was the offspring, et cetera.</p>
<p>Just near impossible</p>
<p>and probably not the most important experiment</p>
<p>to invest our time doing.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there continues to be a lot of lore</p>
<p>about what determines the sex of the offspring.</p>
<p>Most notably, there&rsquo;s a lot of lore and discussion</p>
<p>and rumor about the idea that particular sexual positions</p>
<p>at the point of ejaculation during intercourse</p>
<p>can somehow bias the likelihood</p>
<p>that a pregnancy will be either resulting</p>
<p>in male or female offspring.</p>
<p>Now, again, there are zero data to support this.</p>
<p>And yet this whole notion of sex determination</p>
<p>is a really interesting one</p>
<p>that people seem to be somewhat obsessed by.</p>
<p>So much so that, again, if you go online</p>
<p>or if you were to talk to people in the sort of,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call it holistic or peripheral health spaces</p>
<p>related to fertility, there is discussion about,</p>
<p>okay, well, you take this sexual position</p>
<p>at the point of ejaculation to get a boy</p>
<p>and you take that sexual position</p>
<p>at the point of ejaculation to get a girl,</p>
<p>or you do this in the early part of the day</p>
<p>or the later part of the day.</p>
<p>Again, all for which there is zero data</p>
<p>to support any kind of systematic relationship</p>
<p>between what I just discussed</p>
<p>and the biological sex of the offspring.</p>
<p>That said, there are now emerging methods</p>
<p>that people are using in order to separate out the sperm</p>
<p>that will indeed give rise to a male offspring</p>
<p>versus a female offspring.</p>
<p>Now, this of course is done</p>
<p>in the context of in vitro fertilization.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t talked too much about in vitro fertilization,</p>
<p>but in vitro fertilization involves, as the name suggests,</p>
<p>taking an egg and taking a sperm, pairing them in a dish.</p>
<p>This can be done a number of different ways,</p>
<p>but just to briefly describe the IVF procedure,</p>
<p>IVF involves administering supra,</p>
<p>meaning greater than normal, supraphysiological levels</p>
<p>of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone</p>
<p>during the follicular phase of a woman&rsquo;s cycle.</p>
<p>What that causes is the maturation of not just one egg</p>
<p>that would be ovulated, but multiple follicles and eggs.</p>
<p>And then ovulation itself is suppressed</p>
<p>also through the administration of exogenous hormones.</p>
<p>And then under ultrasound guidance,</p>
<p>an OBGYN goes in and collects the mature eggs and follicles,</p>
<p>puts them in a dish,</p>
<p>and then sperm are delivered to that dish.</p>
<p>And those could either be sperm</p>
<p>that were frozen previously, or more typically,</p>
<p>or ideally it would be live sperm collected that day</p>
<p>that are washed through a very straightforward procedure.</p>
<p>And then those sperm either are allowed to compete</p>
<p>for those eggs and fertilize those eggs</p>
<p>and allow them to advance to very early embryo stage</p>
<p>before those embryos are frozen</p>
<p>and eventually implanted into a woman</p>
<p>in order to have them be carried to full term.</p>
<p>Ideally, or there&rsquo;s a procedure</p>
<p>in which specific sperm are selected</p>
<p>because they have the best morphology,</p>
<p>motility, and so forth.</p>
<p>And in a process called ICSI, I-C-S-I,</p>
<p>in which the sperm themselves are literally forced</p>
<p>to fertilize that particular egg.</p>
<p>Now, under those conditions,</p>
<p>typically a couple or a woman,</p>
<p>if she&rsquo;s doing this on her own with a sperm donor,</p>
<p>will get multiple fertilized embryos, okay,</p>
<p>that are carried to a multicellular stage</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s clear that they could grow into a child</p>
<p>if they were implanted into a viable host,</p>
<p>sometimes the surrogate,</p>
<p>sometimes the woman who wants the child herself.</p>
<p>And under those conditions,</p>
<p>it is possible to look at the genetic makeup,</p>
<p>including the karyotype of those early nascent embryos,</p>
<p>in which case people really can select the sex</p>
<p>of their offspring.</p>
<p>They will have some embryos that are XX,</p>
<p>some embryos that are XY.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very likely also that they will have some embryos</p>
<p>that have karyotypes or genotypes which are not ideal</p>
<p>in that they would potentially lead to a miscarriage</p>
<p>or some other genetic defect.</p>
<p>And so typically people do not select</p>
<p>to implant those embryos</p>
<p>if they have the option to implant embryos</p>
<p>that are of either XX or XY karyotype</p>
<p>and the normal chromosomal arrangements</p>
<p>for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>So the whole point here is that sex selection is possible</p>
<p>but only using in vitro fertilization.</p>
<p>The other thing that is becoming clear to us</p>
<p>in more recent years is that sex selection</p>
<p>is actually possible at the level of the sperm</p>
<p>even prior to fertilization.</p>
<p>This is an emerging dataset</p>
<p>and this is largely happening in clinics</p>
<p>outside of the United States,</p>
<p>but there are some clinics that have figured out methods</p>
<p>in which they can take a sperm sample</p>
<p>and they can spin that sperm sample in a centrifuge</p>
<p>at a rate that separates out the sperm</p>
<p>into what are called different fractions.</p>
<p>So for those of you who&rsquo;ve done a little bit of biology</p>
<p>with centrifuges, when you spin any kind of substance</p>
<p>that includes multiple things in it of different weights,</p>
<p>when you spin them, the things of different weights</p>
<p>segregate out into different fractions</p>
<p>along the depth of the tube.</p>
<p>And then you can take out one fraction or the next</p>
<p>simply with a little pipette.</p>
<p>You take out the top fraction, the middle fraction</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>And what these clinics have figured out</p>
<p>is that if they spin the sperm sample</p>
<p>at the correct spin rate,</p>
<p>that the sperm that will give rise to male offspring</p>
<p>and the sperm that will give rise to female offspring</p>
<p>segregate out into different fractions,</p>
<p>allowing them to take each of those fractions separately</p>
<p>and to apply them to eggs if it&rsquo;s in vitro fertilization</p>
<p>and give rise very reliably,</p>
<p>certainly much more than chance</p>
<p>to either male or female embryos.</p>
<p>They also, of course, can choose to do this</p>
<p>outside the context of in vitro fertilization.</p>
<p>So some people are now opting to have their sperm samples</p>
<p>spun out in this way,</p>
<p>separate out the sperm that give rise</p>
<p>to male or female offspring,</p>
<p>and then to only use the fraction</p>
<p>that they are interested in, right?</p>
<p>So if they want a boy, they&rsquo;ll use one fraction.</p>
<p>If they want a girl, they&rsquo;ll use different fraction.</p>
<p>And then to use those fractions in the context</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s called IUI or intrauterine insemination,</p>
<p>which is, as the name suggests,</p>
<p>rather than having the man deliver the ejaculate</p>
<p>with his penis and the sperm with his penis,</p>
<p>they have a device.</p>
<p>The devices are now commercially sold.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, they&rsquo;re sold over the counter</p>
<p>and on the internet.</p>
<p>So people will even do this at home.</p>
<p>And so what they&rsquo;re doing is they&rsquo;ll take the sperm</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll do IUI in order to bias the probability</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to get a male or a female offspring.</p>
<p>Again, this is something that&rsquo;s now emerging.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not commonplace.</p>
<p>Most of the time, people simply roll the dice, as it were,</p>
<p>by having either intercourse and just hoping for,</p>
<p>or not caring if, they get a male or female offspring.</p>
<p>Or in the instance of IVF,</p>
<p>selecting male or female offspring,</p>
<p>sometimes largely on the basis</p>
<p>of the chromosomal arrangements.</p>
<p>So of course, some people might prefer to have one</p>
<p>or the other biological sex as their offspring.</p>
<p>But of course, the healthy chromosomal arrangements</p>
<p>are going to be paramount for getting a healthy child.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>unhealthy chromosomal arrangements</p>
<p>or abnormal chromosomal arrangements</p>
<p>often lead to miscarriage and or birth defects.</p>
<p>So selecting for healthy chromosomal arrangements</p>
<p>is always paramount,</p>
<p>but some people are selecting for biological sex.</p>
<p>And indeed, some couples who can conceive naturally</p>
<p>are opting for IUI in order to be able</p>
<p>to select biological sex</p>
<p>because of this ability to spin out the sperm samples</p>
<p>to different fractions and select the male or female sperm.</p>
<p>That is the sperm that would give rise</p>
<p>to a male or female offspring.</p>
<p>So this is a rapidly emerging theme, believe it or not.</p>
<p>Who knew?</p>
<p>And of course, it has nothing to do</p>
<p>with Aristotle&rsquo;s assertions</p>
<p>about what people are thinking about</p>
<p>at the point of ejaculation,</p>
<p>nor does it have anything to do with body position</p>
<p>at the point of ejaculation.</p>
<p>But I do find it rather interesting</p>
<p>that even in this day and age,</p>
<p>people seem to be continually pursuing new</p>
<p>and different ways to understand why one sperm</p>
<p>or another sperm happens to fertilize the egg.</p>
<p>And when that information is not available,</p>
<p>because frankly, it&rsquo;s not available yet,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know why a sperm containing a Y chromosome</p>
<p>or sperm containing X chromosome</p>
<p>is more likely to fertilize an egg.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s some ideas, for instance,</p>
<p>that older fathers tend to have more daughters</p>
<p>as opposed to sons.</p>
<p>But when you really look at the data, it&rsquo;s pretty mixed.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve heard that before,</p>
<p>has a particular nickname that I&rsquo;m not going to describe</p>
<p>on the podcast, you can look it up online.</p>
<p>But if any of you are aware of any other kind of ideals</p>
<p>or lore, no matter how ridiculous or crazy,</p>
<p>please put them in the comment section on YouTube.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be very curious to learn about those,</p>
<p>mostly out of interest and curiosity.</p>
<p>But look, sometimes these outrageous stories</p>
<p>such as notions of body position</p>
<p>and how they influence biological sex,</p>
<p>even though they turn out not to be true,</p>
<p>turn out to be interesting for other reasons.</p>
<p>And in fact, next, we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>how body position during sexual intercourse</p>
<p>can in fact influence fertility and pregnancy.</p>
<p>So another common theme around fertility and pregnancy</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll hear about is that for couples</p>
<p>that are trying to get pregnant,</p>
<p>that during intercourse,</p>
<p>they should do whatever it is that works for them.</p>
<p>But then after the man ejaculates,</p>
<p>that the woman should try and position her ankles</p>
<p>above her head or somehow otherwise tilt her pelvis back</p>
<p>in order to increase the rate and or probability</p>
<p>that the sperm swim toward the egg</p>
<p>as opposed to the other direction.</p>
<p>Now, I talked to a couple of different OBGYNs</p>
<p>and urologists that are focused on fertility</p>
<p>about this topic.</p>
<p>And it turns out you get pretty mixed answers</p>
<p>as to whether or not there&rsquo;s any validity</p>
<p>to this idea that the woman&rsquo;s body position</p>
<p>after the man ejaculates inside of her</p>
<p>can somehow influence the probability of pregnancy.</p>
<p>One group of experts told me</p>
<p>that there is no reason for a woman</p>
<p>to need to continue to lie down, elevate the ankles,</p>
<p>or in any way, tilt her pelvis back</p>
<p>in order to increase the probability</p>
<p>of successful fertilization.</p>
<p>The other group suggested that indeed,</p>
<p>there is a strong reason to believe</p>
<p>that tilting the pelvis back,</p>
<p>maybe even keeping the ankles elevated</p>
<p>and having a woman lie on her back for about 15 minutes</p>
<p>with the pelvis positioned at about 20 degrees back</p>
<p>is ideal for optimizing fertilization.</p>
<p>I mean, they were really specific about the recommendation.</p>
<p>So I find this interesting that within the cohort</p>
<p>of extremely well-trained MDs, OBGYNs,</p>
<p>and urology fertility docs and OBGYNs,</p>
<p>you see a split that has nothing to do</p>
<p>with whether or not the physician was male or female</p>
<p>or their training or their institution, none of that.</p>
<p>There just seemed to be a sort of even split</p>
<p>between the two.</p>
<p>Now, granted, it wasn&rsquo;t the largest sample size</p>
<p>that I could have obtained,</p>
<p>and yet I do find it interesting</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s this split in the opinion about this.</p>
<p>One group, the group that said,</p>
<p>no, pelvic position doesn&rsquo;t really matter,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry about it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to influence the rates of fertilization,</p>
<p>argued that the sperm swim very quickly</p>
<p>and that if they are released near the cervix,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to swim very quickly toward the egg</p>
<p>in order to fertilize it, regardless of pelvic position.</p>
<p>The other group said, well, yes, sperm swim quickly,</p>
<p>and even if they&rsquo;re released right at the entry</p>
<p>to the cervix, that the sperm</p>
<p>still have a long distance to go.</p>
<p>Again, if you were to scale this</p>
<p>according to the size of the sperm</p>
<p>versus the size of a human body, an entire human body,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;d scale it to is the distance</p>
<p>between Los Angeles and San Francisco,</p>
<p>and it needs to undergo that</p>
<p>basically within 24 hours or so,</p>
<p>although, as we mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>sperm can survive quite a while inside of the woman&rsquo;s body,</p>
<p>maybe three or five days at least.</p>
<p>So in both cases, they acknowledge it&rsquo;s a long distance,</p>
<p>but on the one hand, you have a group of experts</p>
<p>that are saying the sperm more or less know what to do</p>
<p>and are going to do it regardless of the position</p>
<p>of the woman after ejaculation inside her,</p>
<p>and the other group saying,</p>
<p>no, we want to do everything we can</p>
<p>to bias the likelihood that the sperm will fertilize the egg.</p>
<p>Okay, well, setting aside the basic argument</p>
<p>that tilting back of the pelvis and lying stationary or so</p>
<p>for about 15 minutes after sexual intercourse</p>
<p>and ejaculation is not an expensive, you know, endeavor,</p>
<p>although it requires a little bit of time,</p>
<p>and it forces people to remain motionless</p>
<p>or close to motionless,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not up and around and moving about.</p>
<p>Aside from that, it&rsquo;s a relatively low investment.</p>
<p>So one argument is,</p>
<p>well, if it could bias the likelihood of fertilization</p>
<p>at all and people want to get pregnant,</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t they do that?</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s a reasonable argument,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t really point to the mechanism.</p>
<p>The arguments that point to a potential mechanism</p>
<p>are that if you recall what we were talking about</p>
<p>when we talked about sperm quality,</p>
<p>sperm quality involves a bunch of different measures</p>
<p>like concentration of sperm per milliliter semen,</p>
<p>morphology of those sperm, how many are forward motile.</p>
<p>It turns out that in any one ejaculate sample,</p>
<p>the total number of forward motile</p>
<p>and yet fast forward motile sperm</p>
<p>that are also of the highest quality morphology</p>
<p>is actually quite low.</p>
<p>And so the idea here is that you want to get as many sperm</p>
<p>of the highest quality swimming toward the egg</p>
<p>because those sperm stand the highest probability</p>
<p>of fertilizing that egg.</p>
<p>And in fact, this relates to some of the discussion</p>
<p>we were having earlier about behavioral dos and don&rsquo;ts</p>
<p>for sake of increasing the probability of fertilization.</p>
<p>And the one that is most important here is cannabis.</p>
<p>It turns out that the data on cannabis</p>
<p>really do support the idea</p>
<p>that some of you may have heard from parents and teachers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I did hear this from parents and teachers</p>
<p>that cannabis can disrupt the swimming styles of sperm</p>
<p>in ways that are not supportive of fertilization,</p>
<p>that it can turn more of the sperm into twitchers.</p>
<p>Although when I learned about this,</p>
<p>I was not informed of the word twitchers.</p>
<p>What I was told is that if you use cannabis,</p>
<p>that the sperm don&rsquo;t know which direction to go,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re confused,</p>
<p>almost implying that the sperm themselves</p>
<p>are high on cannabis.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s certainly not the argument</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m making here,</p>
<p>but it does seem to be the case</p>
<p>that people who use cannabis,</p>
<p>even once the sperm that are generated</p>
<p>during that particular month or two months,</p>
<p>during which or after which they use cannabis,</p>
<p>have less forward motility</p>
<p>and possibly altered morphology as well.</p>
<p>Okay, I want to be very clear.</p>
<p>I did not say that if you use cannabis once,</p>
<p>you are forever disrupting the motility</p>
<p>and morphology of your sperm.</p>
<p>I did not say that.</p>
<p>What I said is that if you use cannabis once,</p>
<p>then the sperm that are generated in the 60 days</p>
<p>after that cannabis use</p>
<p>are going to have a higher incidence of disrupted motility</p>
<p>and perhaps morphology as well.</p>
<p>Okay, remember, sperm are continually generated</p>
<p>every 60 days or so.</p>
<p>And so if you use cannabis once,</p>
<p>you are not forever disrupting your sperm.</p>
<p>But if you are using cannabis</p>
<p>and then you are looking to conceive in the next 60 days,</p>
<p>you are going to be reducing,</p>
<p>we think significantly so,</p>
<p>the number of quality forwardly motile sperm.</p>
<p>So the simple takeaway from this is avoid cannabis use.</p>
<p>Although if you are going to use cannabis,</p>
<p>and again, there are medical uses of cannabis</p>
<p>and beneficial uses of cannabis for certain populations.</p>
<p>It can be bad for other populations.</p>
<p>We talked about that in the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>all about cannabis.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re going to use cannabis,</p>
<p>you should try and abstain from cannabis</p>
<p>in the two months prior to the attempt to fertilize</p>
<p>and get pregnant.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not aware of any data on how cannabis use</p>
<p>by the woman can influence the likelihood</p>
<p>of fertilization and pregnancy.</p>
<p>And I want to couch this whole discussion around cannabis</p>
<p>under the umbrella of something that came up</p>
<p>in the episode that I did on cannabis,</p>
<p>which is that for about half of people out there,</p>
<p>male and female, okay?</p>
<p>So here, we&rsquo;re not distinguishing by biological sex.</p>
<p>About half of people that use cannabis</p>
<p>report it as an aphrodisiac.</p>
<p>It makes them want to have sexual intercourse</p>
<p>more than if they don&rsquo;t use cannabis.</p>
<p>And for the other half,</p>
<p>it actually has the opposite effect</p>
<p>by way of an influence on a hormone called prolactin,</p>
<p>which suppresses the dopamine system, the testosterone,</p>
<p>and the estrogenic system.</p>
<p>And so this whole idea that cannabis is an aphrodisiac</p>
<p>seems to be true for about half of the human population</p>
<p>and not for the other half of the human population.</p>
<p>So I mentioned that because I know a number of people</p>
<p>use cannabis as an aphrodisiac.</p>
<p>They like to use cannabis before intercourse.</p>
<p>It was actually very surprising to me to discover</p>
<p>when I researched that cannabis episode</p>
<p>that approximately 15, 1.5% of women who are pregnant</p>
<p>continue to use cannabis during pregnancy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very alarming statistic.</p>
<p>And everything we know is that the use of cannabis</p>
<p>during pregnancy is detrimental to the health,</p>
<p>in particular, the brain development of the fetus.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a real concern.</p>
<p>I highly recommend women abstain</p>
<p>from cannabis use during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Talk to your OB-GYN about it if you&rsquo;re using it all</p>
<p>or considering using it all.</p>
<p>So based on what I told you earlier about the fact</p>
<p>that cannabis use is not good for egg quality</p>
<p>and the fact that cannabis use can disrupt</p>
<p>the motility of sperm and therefore is not good</p>
<p>for sperm quality, and it can disrupt the patterns</p>
<p>of swimming in sperm in ways that reduce</p>
<p>the likelihood of fertility,</p>
<p>I think the take-home message is clear,</p>
<p>which is that whether or not you want to be</p>
<p>a cannabis user or not,</p>
<p>if you are going to try and conceive,</p>
<p>and certainly while you&rsquo;re pregnant,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to want to avoid the use of cannabis.</p>
<p>And that is smoked cannabis and vaped cannabis.</p>
<p>And during pregnancy, the consumption of cannabis,</p>
<p>even in edible form or in tincture form,</p>
<p>is also going to be detrimental to the developing fetus.</p>
<p>But of course, we started this conversation</p>
<p>in the context of body position,</p>
<p>in particular, at the point of ejaculation</p>
<p>in determining the sex of the offspring</p>
<p>and or the likelihood of getting</p>
<p>a successful fertilization in pregnancy.</p>
<p>And I think that given that the tilting back of the pelvis,</p>
<p>so again, this is elevating the pelvis by about 20 degrees,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it has to be exact, exact,</p>
<p>but about 20 degrees for about 15 minutes</p>
<p>post-ejaculation inside of the woman,</p>
<p>or I suppose if people are using IUI,</p>
<p>intrauterine insemination,</p>
<p>since that seems to be the consensus among those experts</p>
<p>that believe that pelvic tilt backward can be beneficial</p>
<p>for increasing the probability of fertilization.</p>
<p>And given that it involves no cost,</p>
<p>but a little bit of time,</p>
<p>seems to me that if you want to get pregnant,</p>
<p>that that would be the right thing to do.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, there&rsquo;s no information,</p>
<p>nor was I able to obtain any recommendations from experts</p>
<p>about what the ideal body position of the male is</p>
<p>after ejaculation if the goal is to increase</p>
<p>the probability of fertilization in pregnancy.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve been talking about behavioral interventions,</p>
<p>some do&rsquo;s and some don&rsquo;ts that people can do</p>
<p>to increase their fertility and the likelihood</p>
<p>that any fertilized egg</p>
<p>will be carried to term successfully.</p>
<p>And soon we&rsquo;ll also talk about things</p>
<p>that people can take to improve their fertility.</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind that this entire discussion</p>
<p>is about fertility, but also remember,</p>
<p>as we discussed at the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>trying to increase your fertility</p>
<p>is one of the best ways to think about</p>
<p>trying to create and maintain optimal physical health.</p>
<p>So for people that are trying to conceive</p>
<p>and for people who are not trying to conceive,</p>
<p>optimizing your fertility status,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re male or female,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the best ways to target those approaches.</p>
<p>And there are now a lot of data supporting the idea</p>
<p>that acupuncture of all things can be very beneficial</p>
<p>for improving both female and male fertility.</p>
<p>And should a woman get pregnant</p>
<p>for improving the quality of outcomes,</p>
<p>that is the likelihood that there will be</p>
<p>a successful pregnancy that is carried to term,</p>
<p>not premature and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Now, for some of you out there,</p>
<p>you might think, oh, of course, acupuncture.</p>
<p>Acupuncture has been known to work for thousands of years,</p>
<p>and therefore it&rsquo;s not surprising</p>
<p>that it would assist with fertility and pregnancy.</p>
<p>For many of you out there, however,</p>
<p>probably thinking acupuncture,</p>
<p>that seems kind of like fringe science,</p>
<p>but what I can assure you is that there are now</p>
<p>quite a few clinical trials funded by government agencies</p>
<p>like the National Institutes of Health</p>
<p>showing that acupuncture is a very effective treatment</p>
<p>for a number of different things,</p>
<p>including fertility and pregnancy,</p>
<p>but for hormone status, for stress relief,</p>
<p>but even for chronic illnesses of different kinds,</p>
<p>including autoimmune illnesses.</p>
<p>So this is no longer considered fringe science.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the best laboratories in the world</p>
<p>working on this is a laboratory</p>
<p>out of Harvard Medical School</p>
<p>run by a guy named Chufu Ma.</p>
<p>Chufu&rsquo;s lab has really been exploring in a mechanistic way</p>
<p>how the different stimulation sites</p>
<p>that are used in acupuncture,</p>
<p>so where the needles are inserted,</p>
<p>tap into neural pathways</p>
<p>that link the different organs of the body.</p>
<p>So for instance, they&rsquo;ve found that stimulation</p>
<p>of a particular site on the lower limb</p>
<p>can reduce inflammation dramatically throughout the body</p>
<p>by way of neural pathways that originate in the lower limb</p>
<p>and extend to areas such as the kidney and the pancreas.</p>
<p>So all these quote-unquote ancient maps of the human body</p>
<p>as they relate to acupuncture</p>
<p>are now being parsed at the level of mechanism,</p>
<p>which I think is wonderful</p>
<p>because it not only is showing us</p>
<p>that so much of what has been purported and reported</p>
<p>in the landscape of acupuncture</p>
<p>actually has an underlying mechanistic basis,</p>
<p>and with additional mechanistic understanding, of course,</p>
<p>always arrive new and better practices.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the idea, to evolve these fields of acupuncture,</p>
<p>to evolve the fields of mechanistic understanding</p>
<p>of our biology and health.</p>
<p>And so the issue of whether or not acupuncture</p>
<p>can assist in getting pregnant</p>
<p>and in carrying a child to term</p>
<p>and for that child to be healthy</p>
<p>are really starting to emerge in a major way.</p>
<p>And rather than go into all those data in detail,</p>
<p>what I can tell you is that there are clinical trials</p>
<p>and data supporting the fact that female fertility itself</p>
<p>can be supported by acupuncture through several mechanisms,</p>
<p>one of which is the balancing,</p>
<p>and I realize that&rsquo;s a somewhat tricky term</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll define it better in a moment,</p>
<p>the balancing of hormones</p>
<p>across the ovulatory slash menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>including regulating levels of FSH</p>
<p>so that they&rsquo;re not too high nor too low</p>
<p>and restricting the FSH to the follicular phase</p>
<p>of the menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>as well as using acupuncture to improve things</p>
<p>like blood flow and the health of the ovary itself</p>
<p>and other aspects of the female reproductive axis.</p>
<p>So acupuncture can operate at the chemical level,</p>
<p>impacting hormones.</p>
<p>It can act at the mechanical level,</p>
<p>impacting the different tissues</p>
<p>through which the egg has to pass and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Likewise, on the male side,</p>
<p>acupuncture has been shown to improve semen volume,</p>
<p>quality of sperm, sperm motility, et cetera,</p>
<p>and in large part through changes in the neural pathways</p>
<p>that innervate the very tissues and vascular input</p>
<p>to the scrotum and testicles,</p>
<p>because as we learned earlier,</p>
<p>temperature regulation of the scrotum and testicles</p>
<p>is so vital for getting healthy sperm</p>
<p>and increasing sperm quality.</p>
<p>In addition, there are good data to support the idea</p>
<p>that acupuncture can increase levels</p>
<p>of testosterone, free testosterone,</p>
<p>and the sorts of hormones that are going to support</p>
<p>healthy hormone production and sperm production in males.</p>
<p>And this is distinct from applying testosterone</p>
<p>from an exogenous source, right?</p>
<p>So when we&rsquo;re talking about acupuncture</p>
<p>and increasing levels of testosterone,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about increasing levels</p>
<p>of endogenous testosterone.</p>
<p>So those Leydig cells can support the Sertoli cells</p>
<p>and the Sertoli cells can make</p>
<p>that androgen binding protein,</p>
<p>and you get enhanced spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>You can find evidence for all of these different features,</p>
<p>both changes to the chemical milieu, that is the hormones,</p>
<p>and changes to the mechanical milieu,</p>
<p>including, for instance,</p>
<p>improvement of the pathways leading</p>
<p>from the seminiferous tubules to the epididymis</p>
<p>to the vas deferens,</p>
<p>basically clearing out the plumbing</p>
<p>so that more quality ejaculate can be delivered,</p>
<p>which of course is going to increase</p>
<p>the probability of fertilization.</p>
<p>So when you hear that acupuncture can improve</p>
<p>the likelihood of pregnancy,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an accurate statement for which</p>
<p>there are now increasing amounts of mechanistic data.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about how acupuncture</p>
<p>can be used to contribute</p>
<p>to improve fertilization in pregnancy,</p>
<p>there are a number of different excellent reviews on this,</p>
<p>both as it relates to females and as it relates to males.</p>
<p>One of the best papers that I happen to like</p>
<p>is one that we&rsquo;ll provide a link to in the references</p>
<p>entitled Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine</p>
<p>for Female Fertility, an Overview of Systematic Reviews.</p>
<p>So a review of reviews.</p>
<p>This was published recently in 2021.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll provide a link to that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also going to be a link to a review</p>
<p>that relates to acupuncture for male fertility</p>
<p>and hormone augmentation.</p>
<p>I should just mention briefly</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re going to look at scientific papers,</p>
<p>one thing that you&rsquo;ll want to consider</p>
<p>is also looking at the references that they reference.</p>
<p>And now, of course, papers tend to reference</p>
<p>a ton of references, in particular in reviews.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;ll want to do is look for the references</p>
<p>that are showing up most often in the introduction.</p>
<p>Those references often are going to be</p>
<p>the most prominent recent reviews</p>
<p>or the most important findings in recent years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not always the case, but that&rsquo;s often the case.</p>
<p>So if you read the first couple of paragraphs</p>
<p>of these papers, and these are openly available</p>
<p>as full text, by the way, online, if you go to these links,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to access the best papers,</p>
<p>the most relevant papers,</p>
<p>in the context of acupuncture supporting female</p>
<p>and acupuncture supporting male fertility</p>
<p>and hormone status.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to discuss things that both men and women</p>
<p>can take in order to maximize their fertility.</p>
<p>And again, and again, when we&rsquo;re talking about fertility,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about people who want to conceive</p>
<p>and have children, but also we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>a basic measure of overall health status.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who does not want to conceive children,</p>
<p>I still encourage you to think about whether or not</p>
<p>you would want to do certain things or not do certain things</p>
<p>in order to maximize your fertility as a means</p>
<p>to maximize your vitality and longevity,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really what maximizing fertility is about</p>
<p>for a lot of people.</p>
<p>That said, I know a lot of people would like</p>
<p>to conceive children, perhaps not right away,</p>
<p>but in the future, and what I&rsquo;m about to describe</p>
<p>are some tools and interventions that is things</p>
<p>that one can take in order to improve their hormone status,</p>
<p>but also in particular, the quality of their eggs</p>
<p>and the quality of their sperm in the short and long-term.</p>
<p>The first on the list of things that people can take</p>
<p>in order to improve egg quality or sperm quality</p>
<p>is L-carnitine.</p>
<p>L-carnitine is present in various foods,</p>
<p>in particular in red meats,</p>
<p>but again, it&rsquo;s going to be very hard</p>
<p>to get sufficient levels of L-carnitine</p>
<p>to improve egg quality and sperm quality,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re going to take it in supplement form.</p>
<p>The typical recommendation based on peer-reviewed studies,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve shown significant improvements in egg quality,</p>
<p>that is chromosomal arrangements,</p>
<p>that is the likelihood of fertility or pregnancy rather,</p>
<p>the likelihood of sperm being forward fast swimmers</p>
<p>as opposed to twitchers or emotile</p>
<p>and having proper morphology.</p>
<p>All those measures has been demonstrated</p>
<p>to be significantly improved by the ingestion of L-carnitine.</p>
<p>How much L-carnitine?</p>
<p>Well, that depends on how you&rsquo;re obtaining the L-carnitine.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re obtaining it in capsule form,</p>
<p>one to three grams per day of capsule form L-carnitine</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s been suggested to improve egg quality</p>
<p>and sperm quality.</p>
<p>Now, one to three grams per day can be taken all at once</p>
<p>or spread out throughout the 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>It can be taken with or without food,</p>
<p>does not seem to matter.</p>
<p>And when taken for a period of 30 to 60 days,</p>
<p>does seem to significantly improve all the parameters</p>
<p>that have been discussed for egg quality and sperm quality.</p>
<p>Now, the mechanism for that effect is pretty clear.</p>
<p>L-carnitine is involved in the processing of lipids, fats,</p>
<p>in terms of mitochondrial function.</p>
<p>And as we talked about before,</p>
<p>mitochondria are vital for the organization</p>
<p>and action of the spindle that pulls apart the chromosomes,</p>
<p>taking that cell within the female from diploid to haploid,</p>
<p>which is essential.</p>
<p>You really want just the 23 individual chromosomal strands.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want chromosomal repeats.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also involved in the actual fusion of the egg</p>
<p>as it exits the ovary and enters the ovulation cycle.</p>
<p>Mitochondria are also important, as we talked about before,</p>
<p>for the forward motility of sperm</p>
<p>because of the enrichment of mitochondria</p>
<p>in that mid region just behind the head</p>
<p>that caused the whipping flagellation of the tail,</p>
<p>allowing for forward movement,</p>
<p>as well as other aspects of cellular morphology.</p>
<p>So it makes a lot of sense</p>
<p>as to why L-carnitine supplementation would be beneficial.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s one to three grams per day</p>
<p>over a period of about 30 to 60 months.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re hoping to conceive in the upcoming months,</p>
<p>recommend taking it for at least 30 days prior to that.</p>
<p>Of course, based on the data we talked about before,</p>
<p>the cumulative probability, fecundability, et cetera,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no reason to not continue to try for pregnancy</p>
<p>before taking L-carnitine.</p>
<p>But L-carnitine is going to improve egg and sperm quality.</p>
<p>And so you might actually take the stance</p>
<p>that even if you don&rsquo;t have any problem getting pregnant,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you want to maximize the quality of the egg</p>
<p>that gets fertilized and the quality of the sperm</p>
<p>that fertilizes that egg?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s additional rationale for taking L-carnitine.</p>
<p>One important note,</p>
<p>if you are going to take L-carnitine in oral form,</p>
<p>in capsule form, it can increase something called TMAO.</p>
<p>TMAO can cause stiffening of the arteries.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want TMAO levels to go too high.</p>
<p>One way to offset the increases in TMAO</p>
<p>caused by oral L-carnitine</p>
<p>is to take 600 milligrams of garlic per day.</p>
<p>I suppose you could eat cloves of garlic.</p>
<p>That would work just as well</p>
<p>because garlic contains something called allicin,</p>
<p>which can offset the increase in TMAO.</p>
<p>But 600 milligram capsules of garlic are going to be,</p>
<p>or garlic extract rather,</p>
<p>is going to be the most probably cost-effective</p>
<p>and simplest way to do this.</p>
<p>And also they are going to create that garlic smell.</p>
<p>Some people like the smell of garlic, some people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to take oral L-carnitine,</p>
<p>I suggest also taking 600 milligrams a day</p>
<p>of garlic extract.</p>
<p>And you can do that at any time throughout the day.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be with the L-carnitine.</p>
<p>The next item on the list of compounds</p>
<p>that have been shown to improve egg quality</p>
<p>and sperm quality, and quite robustly so, is coenzyme Q10.</p>
<p>Coenzyme Q10 is something that you can actually</p>
<p>measure levels of in your blood.</p>
<p>Most physicians will say that they want to see</p>
<p>your levels of coenzyme Q10</p>
<p>to be somewhere between 0.5 and 2.5.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to depend on the units.</p>
<p>Most people, I realize, are not going to run off</p>
<p>and get their CoQ10 measured.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not included in most standard blood tests,</p>
<p>but if you were to measure your CoQ10,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the range that you want to look for.</p>
<p>That said, many people opt to supplement with CoQ10,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll find that many fertility docs, OBGYNs,</p>
<p>and urologists that are trying to assist their male patients</p>
<p>with fertility will suggest CoQ10,</p>
<p>because again, it supports the health of mitochondria.</p>
<p>Mitochondria are so vital to so many aspects</p>
<p>of the formation and fertilization of the egg and sperm</p>
<p>that, of course, fertilizes the egg.</p>
<p>The coenzyme Q10 dosages that are most often suggested</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;ll observe in the peer-reviewed research</p>
<p>literature on humans, I should add,</p>
<p>is 100 to 400 milligrams per day.</p>
<p>And the coenzyme Q10 is taken generally with a meal</p>
<p>and ideally a meal that contains fat.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s even some idea that taking coenzyme Q10</p>
<p>with your dinner, assuming that dinner includes some fat,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to add additional fat,</p>
<p>is going to be more advantageous</p>
<p>than taking coenzyme Q10 early in the day,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s probably a detail</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s getting a little too far down in the weeds.</p>
<p>So again, 100 to 400 milligrams of coenzyme Q10 per day,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re a man or a woman,</p>
<p>for improving the likelihood of fertility</p>
<p>by way of improving egg and sperm quality.</p>
<p>And again, if you&rsquo;re somebody who just doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>any problem getting pregnant,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re already producing many sperm</p>
<p>of quality morphology,</p>
<p>this is another case in which you could take a step back</p>
<p>and just say, well, why wouldn&rsquo;t I want</p>
<p>to further optimize the quality of the egg and the sperm?</p>
<p>Because the quality of the egg and the sperm</p>
<p>ultimately are going to determine</p>
<p>not just whether or not you have a successful pregnancy,</p>
<p>but are going to determine, admittedly,</p>
<p>in ways that will forever remain cryptic to you,</p>
<p>but nonetheless are going to be important</p>
<p>in determining the qualities of the brain tissue</p>
<p>and body tissue of your offspring.</p>
<p>The third item on the list of compounds</p>
<p>which are commonly suggested or prescribed</p>
<p>by fertility docs nowadays for men and women</p>
<p>wishing to conceive and or optimize their fertility</p>
<p>as a basis for general vitality and health is inositol.</p>
<p>Now, inositol has many uses.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll hear about the use of inositol</p>
<p>for reducing anxiety or improving mood,</p>
<p>or even for the treatment of depression.</p>
<p>We talked about inositol</p>
<p>in previous episodes of this podcast.</p>
<p>For instance, I talked about inositol,</p>
<p>and in particular, taking 900 milligrams</p>
<p>of myoinositol prior to sleep,</p>
<p>which is something that I do along with</p>
<p>the other supplements that I take and recommend for sleep,</p>
<p>such as magnesium threonate, apigenin, and theanine.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re curious about those,</p>
<p>you can see our newsletter on sleep</p>
<p>or our Perfect Your Sleep episode</p>
<p>or the Master Your Sleep episode</p>
<p>talks about behavioral and supplementation-based tools</p>
<p>for improving sleep.</p>
<p>But myoinositol is not just suggested or prescribed</p>
<p>for people that are wishing to get pregnant</p>
<p>and for general health,</p>
<p>but myoinositol is often recommended</p>
<p>for people that want to improve egg and sperm quality</p>
<p>because of the way that it can positively</p>
<p>impact insulin sensitivity.</p>
<p>Insulin sensitivity might sound like a bad thing</p>
<p>to people out there,</p>
<p>but it turns out that you want to be insulin sensitive.</p>
<p>The last thing you want is to be insulin insensitive.</p>
<p>Insulin insensitivity is associated with type 2 diabetes,</p>
<p>with obesity, and even for people</p>
<p>who are not challenged with obesity.</p>
<p>You want your cells to be insulin sensitive.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want a lot of insulin</p>
<p>floating around in your system</p>
<p>with your cells unable to use that insulin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what insulin insensitivity is about.</p>
<p>Myoinositol at dosages of one to five grams per day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty high, one to five grams per day,</p>
<p>keeping in mind that 1,000 milligrams is one gram,</p>
<p>has been suggested to improve</p>
<p>egg quality and sperm quality.</p>
<p>Now, one point of, I wouldn&rsquo;t say caution,</p>
<p>but of note is that myoinositol can reduce anxiety</p>
<p>and it can be a slight sedative,</p>
<p>which is why some folks, including myself,</p>
<p>take almost a gram, 900 milligrams prior to sleep.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to take five grams of myoinositol,</p>
<p>you would want to restrict that to the late evening</p>
<p>or second half of your day.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t suggest starting that high.</p>
<p>I would start with one or two grams</p>
<p>and then working your way up,</p>
<p>seeing what you can tolerate</p>
<p>in terms of the level of anti-anxiety</p>
<p>and drowsiness that it produces.</p>
<p>One to five grams per day of myoinositol</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s suggested for both men and women</p>
<p>wishing to improve egg health and sperm health.</p>
<p>But for women, it&rsquo;s also often suggested to include also,</p>
<p>okay, so to take myoinositol,</p>
<p>but to also take d-chironositol.</p>
<p>D-chironositol has elements in it</p>
<p>that can be both pro and anti-androgenic.</p>
<p>Androgens are things like testosterone</p>
<p>and related molecules.</p>
<p>There are a number of different causes of infertility</p>
<p>and disruption to egg quality,</p>
<p>age being the most significant factor.</p>
<p>But another significant and very common factor,</p>
<p>even among young women who are of fertile age,</p>
<p>is having too many androgens</p>
<p>and as it relates to something called</p>
<p>polycystic ovarian syndrome.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll do an entire episode about menopause and PCOS</p>
<p>and a number of other things that relate to fertility</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s an entire and very interesting other discussion</p>
<p>that we need to have.</p>
<p>But the recommendation is that women take</p>
<p>one to five grams of myoinositol,</p>
<p>but also d-chironositol because of the ways</p>
<p>that it can balance androgens</p>
<p>and offset some of the negative effects</p>
<p>of polycystic ovarian syndrome,</p>
<p>or even for women who do not have</p>
<p>polycystic ovarian syndrome,</p>
<p>because of the ways that d-chironositol</p>
<p>can balance androgens in ways that are beneficial.</p>
<p>The dosages of d-chironositol that are recommended</p>
<p>tend to be 125th to 140th of the myoinositol dose.</p>
<p>So you have to get out your calculator.</p>
<p>Remember, 1,000 milligrams equals one gram.</p>
<p>So figure out if you&rsquo;re taking one gram</p>
<p>of myoinositol per day or two grams,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to want to convert that to milligrams.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re taking two grams</p>
<p>of myoinositol per day, that&rsquo;s 2,000 milligrams.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;d want to divide that by 25.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how many milligrams of d-chironositol</p>
<p>you would want to take as well.</p>
<p>Or you could go with the lower end dose</p>
<p>and divide it by 40 and take that number of milligrams</p>
<p>of d-chironositol along with the inositol.</p>
<p>Again, probably taking it later in the day</p>
<p>is going to be good.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not clear at all that taking it with food</p>
<p>or without food makes any difference whatsoever.</p>
<p>So I would suggest you do either.</p>
<p>Keep in mind as I&rsquo;m discussing these recommendations,</p>
<p>I may call them prescriptions,</p>
<p>but none of these are prescription drugs.</p>
<p>And of course you should always discuss any supplements</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re planning to take or stop taking for that matter</p>
<p>with your physician.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say that to protect me, I say that to protect you.</p>
<p>You know, anytime you&rsquo;re going to add or change something</p>
<p>in your overall health regimen,</p>
<p>you want to discuss that</p>
<p>with your trusted healthcare professional.</p>
<p>Typically, I would hope a board certified MD.</p>
<p>The fourth item in the list of commonly suggested supplements</p>
<p>for men and women wishing to optimize egg</p>
<p>and sperm quality respectively is omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
<p>And now here we&rsquo;re talking about something</p>
<p>that could be obtained from food</p>
<p>and can be obtained from food.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re consuming fatty ocean fish,</p>
<p>things like sardines, anchovies, salmon with the skin,</p>
<p>chances are you&rsquo;re going to get some quality omega-3s.</p>
<p>Omega-3s are also available in plant-based sources.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also available in krill for that matter.</p>
<p>But most people find it difficult</p>
<p>to reach the threshold required</p>
<p>for optimizing mental health and physical health.</p>
<p>That is the threshold of the EPA essential fatty acids.</p>
<p>And so for that matter,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve suggested before in this podcast</p>
<p>and many fertility docs will suggest</p>
<p>that their patients take omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>in supplement form.</p>
<p>It could be taken in liquid form or in capsule form,</p>
<p>but enough of those so that you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>at least one gram per day of the EPA form of omega-3s.</p>
<p>Okay, so at least one gram per day</p>
<p>and as high as two or even three grams per day</p>
<p>of the EPA form.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll need to look at the packaging</p>
<p>because oftentimes you&rsquo;ll say high potency omega-3s.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll say, you know, 1,500 milligrams of omega-3s,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not 1,500 milligrams of the EPA form.</p>
<p>You look on the back of the label and you&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>each serving contains 750 milligrams of EPA.</p>
<p>You want to get above that one gram dosage per day</p>
<p>and as high as three grams per day of the EPAs.</p>
<p>The most cost-effective way to do that</p>
<p>is going to be liquid form omegas,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a little bit inconvenient for many people</p>
<p>and some people don&rsquo;t like the taste.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they rely on the capsule form omegas.</p>
<p>And of course there are compounds</p>
<p>that can impact fertility status, quality of eggs,</p>
<p>quality of sperm, not by adjusting mitochondria</p>
<p>or insulin sensitivity or creating a general milieu</p>
<p>of support for the egg and the sperm production</p>
<p>and function such as the compounds</p>
<p>that I just listed off to,</p>
<p>but rather compounds that influence the hormones involved</p>
<p>in the generation of sperm and the generation of the eggs</p>
<p>involved in the ovulatory cycle</p>
<p>and the spermatogenesis cycle that is.</p>
<p>Now, these are going to come in different forms</p>
<p>and I want to just emphasize that the supplements</p>
<p>that do this, that adjust hormones in these ways</p>
<p>that can be beneficial are distinct from hormone therapy</p>
<p>or bioidentical hormones, okay?</p>
<p>Distinct from hormone therapy or bioidentical hormones</p>
<p>because as we discussed earlier,</p>
<p>when you take a hormone like testosterone</p>
<p>or even estrogen for that matter</p>
<p>from an exogenous, an outside source,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to disrupt the feedback pathways</p>
<p>inside of your body and you&rsquo;re going to shut down</p>
<p>your own endogenous production.</p>
<p>The supplements I&rsquo;m about to describe do not do that</p>
<p>and yet can adjust levels of hormones in more subtle ways</p>
<p>that can be beneficial for the process</p>
<p>of maximizing fertility for males and for females.</p>
<p>The first of which on this list that I&rsquo;d like to discuss</p>
<p>has been discussed in previous podcasts as well,</p>
<p>which is a substance called Tongat Ali.</p>
<p>Tongat Ali also goes by other names,</p>
<p>but when taken at 400 milligrams per day,</p>
<p>sometimes separated into two dosages,</p>
<p>but typically taken as once a day, early in the day,</p>
<p>because it can be a little bit stimulating,</p>
<p>although not anxiety provoking, I&rsquo;ve never heard of that,</p>
<p>can be a little bit stimulating,</p>
<p>but 400 milligrams a day of Tongat Ali</p>
<p>has been shown to increase free testosterone</p>
<p>by way of reducing something called</p>
<p>sex hormone-binding globulin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also been shown to increase luteinizing hormone,</p>
<p>the net effect of which has been described</p>
<p>as a subtle but significant increase in libido</p>
<p>and some of the other parameters associated</p>
<p>with increased androgens like free testosterone</p>
<p>in males and females.</p>
<p>So a number of people out there</p>
<p>are taking Tongat Ali in this way.</p>
<p>400 milligrams per day,</p>
<p>restricted to the early part of the day</p>
<p>with or without food.</p>
<p>People always ask, do you need to cycle Tongat Ali?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware of any need to cycle Tongat Ali.</p>
<p>In fact, it tends to work better,</p>
<p>meaning the effects on libido</p>
<p>and some other hormone profiles</p>
<p>tends to increase over time.</p>
<p>Again, Tongat Ali is an option,</p>
<p>as certainly none of these things are requirements.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re simply listing off options,</p>
<p>but many people, both males and females,</p>
<p>seem to benefit from and like Tongat Ali,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re not seeking to conceive.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason to think that Tongat Ali</p>
<p>directly improves egg or sperm quality,</p>
<p>except in males, the increase in androgen</p>
<p>created by Tongat Ali supplementation</p>
<p>can indeed lead to improved spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a growing amount of data</p>
<p>in this research literature on Tongat Ali.</p>
<p>Many people find it beneficial.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s something that both men and women</p>
<p>wishing to conceive and or optimize their fertility</p>
<p>just as a general health parameter might want to explore.</p>
<p>The other supplement that&rsquo;s been shown</p>
<p>to improve both egg quality and sperm quality,</p>
<p>and there I&rsquo;m referring to a number of different parameters</p>
<p>related to egg quality and sperm quality,</p>
<p>as well as to increase libido fairly substantially</p>
<p>is a substance called Shilajit.</p>
<p>Shilajit spelled S-H-I-L-A-G-I-T.</p>
<p>Shilajit is actually a compound</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s used in Ayurvedic medicine,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some really good research studies</p>
<p>exploring the supplementation with Shilajit</p>
<p>at about 250 milligrams twice per day.</p>
<p>And this has been looked at in males and in females.</p>
<p>It does seem to significantly increase two hormones.</p>
<p>One is testosterone</p>
<p>and the other is follicle stimulating hormone.</p>
<p>And for that reason, Shilajit is often considered a tonic</p>
<p>that people use both as an aphrodisiac to increase libido,</p>
<p>as well as to increase fertility.</p>
<p>Now, one note of caution,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a woman and you&rsquo;re considering taking Shilajit</p>
<p>in order to increase testosterone</p>
<p>and follicle stimulating hormone,</p>
<p>keep in mind that the ovulatory cycle</p>
<p>is this very tightly regulated cycle</p>
<p>in which you want low but elevated levels</p>
<p>of follicle stimulating hormone</p>
<p>early in the follicular phase,</p>
<p>then it peaks right before ovulation,</p>
<p>and then low levels of follicle stimulating hormone</p>
<p>in the second half of your cycle.</p>
<p>For that reason, using Shilajit chronically</p>
<p>around the entire course of your ovulatory cycle</p>
<p>could be a little bit risky.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d recommend that you talk to your OBGYN</p>
<p>prior to doing that, or if doing that at all.</p>
<p>For males, it&rsquo;s a little bit less of an issue</p>
<p>because as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>sperm are constantly being generated</p>
<p>and the presence of FSH</p>
<p>is going to increase spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>Now, Shilajit is not FSH itself.</p>
<p>Shilajit stimulates the release of FSH</p>
<p>and it stimulates the release of testosterone.</p>
<p>So again, there&rsquo;s no reason to think</p>
<p>that it would shut down your endogenous testosterone</p>
<p>or FSH production.</p>
<p>Although there are a limited amount of data</p>
<p>that really explore that in detail.</p>
<p>Many people use Shilajit</p>
<p>in order to increase their testosterone, FSH,</p>
<p>their libido, and various aspects of sperm health.</p>
<p>Again, the dosages of Shilajit</p>
<p>are about 250 milligrams, two times per day.</p>
<p>One issue with Shilajit is it often comes as a tar.</p>
<p>It was a little hard to measure out the dosages.</p>
<p>Yes, a tar, it&rsquo;s this kind of thick gummy substance</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re supposed to dissolve in water.</p>
<p>And the recommendations are you take a little bead</p>
<p>and dissolve it in water.</p>
<p>It is available in capsule form</p>
<p>where the ability to control the dosage</p>
<p>is made a little bit easier.</p>
<p>But of course, as with any supplement,</p>
<p>I recommend starting with the lowest possible dosage.</p>
<p>So you might want to start with a small,</p>
<p>very small bead of Shilajit dissolved in water,</p>
<p>taken once per day,</p>
<p>and then increase the dosage as needed</p>
<p>in order to obtain the effects that you want.</p>
<p>Things like Shilajit start to bring us into the realm</p>
<p>of what can only be described</p>
<p>as a little bit unwieldy, right?</p>
<p>Here we&rsquo;re saying you can&rsquo;t really control the dosage.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re talking about hormones</p>
<p>that need to be tightly regulated,</p>
<p>at least for females across the ovarian cycle.</p>
<p>For males, yes, it has been shown</p>
<p>to increase testosterone and FSH,</p>
<p>improve sperm motility and sperm count pretty significantly.</p>
<p>No reason to think that you couldn&rsquo;t do that chronically</p>
<p>with Shilajit.</p>
<p>And yet I do want to acknowledge that Shilajit</p>
<p>as this black tar substance</p>
<p>contains a lot of different things.</p>
<p>In fact, it comes from a mineral pitch.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Literally the dirt and plants</p>
<p>that have been compressed by rocks in the Himalayas.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pretty esoteric stuff</p>
<p>when it really comes down to it.</p>
<p>But the biological effects of Shilajit</p>
<p>in both males and females seem to be related</p>
<p>to the fact that it is highly enriched</p>
<p>in something called fulvic acid.</p>
<p>And fulvic acid is involved</p>
<p>in a lot of different cellular processes,</p>
<p>not the least of which, at least in this context,</p>
<p>is the transport of molecules across cell membranes.</p>
<p>And for hormones to have their effect,</p>
<p>they need to cross cell membranes on the outside</p>
<p>and the inside of the cell.</p>
<p>So maybe that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s having its effect.</p>
<p>Again, the mechanisms of exactly how Shilajit</p>
<p>increases testosterone and FSH</p>
<p>and thereby libido, egg quality and sperm quality</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t entirely clear.</p>
<p>But for the more adventurous of you out there</p>
<p>who want to experiment with Shilajit,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re trying to conceive or not,</p>
<p>it might be something to consider.</p>
<p>But of course, do talk to your physician.</p>
<p>The next compound that I want to discuss is zinc.</p>
<p>And then this discussion mainly pertains to males,</p>
<p>although I, of course, should point out</p>
<p>that females should get the recommended daily allowance</p>
<p>of zinc each day.</p>
<p>Males, on the other hand, seem to benefit</p>
<p>from having additionally high levels of zinc intake.</p>
<p>Now that can be obtained through foods.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;ll often hear,</p>
<p>oh, you know, oysters are enriched in zinc</p>
<p>and oysters are an aphrodisiac.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s doing the marketing</p>
<p>for oysters, but it&rsquo;s really terrific.</p>
<p>I think that seems to have persisted.</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s true, oysters are enriched in zinc.</p>
<p>What does zinc do for fertility?</p>
<p>Well, in males, we know,</p>
<p>based on a really nice set of studies,</p>
<p>that zinc dosages that are pretty high,</p>
<p>of about 120 milligrams taken twice per day,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s quite a lot, with meals,</p>
<p>can significantly increase testosterone</p>
<p>and dihydrotestosterone.</p>
<p>And this probably shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise to us.</p>
<p>It turns out that zinc is highly enriched in human testes</p>
<p>and in the testes of other animals,</p>
<p>including fish and other mammals.</p>
<p>And it was actually in 1921 that it was observed in fish</p>
<p>that zinc levels skyrocket in the testes of fish</p>
<p>during their breeding season.</p>
<p>So zinc is correlated with increases in breeding,</p>
<p>but you never know which direction</p>
<p>that correlation is running.</p>
<p>Turns out that zinc in both animals,</p>
<p>including fish, other mammals, and in humans,</p>
<p>strongly impacts the enzymatic functions in the testes,</p>
<p>including the function of androgen binding protein.</p>
<p>So it seems that high levels of zinc</p>
<p>can increase spermatogenesis</p>
<p>and testosterone levels very significantly.</p>
<p>This was explored in a really nice study</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll provide a reference to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an older study, I really like it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Effective Zinc Administration</p>
<p>on Plasma Testosterone, Dihydrotestosterone,</p>
<p>and Sperm Count.</p>
<p>This is but just one study among many now.</p>
<p>This dates back to 1981,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;ve been studies subsequently</p>
<p>that point to the fact that supplementation with zinc</p>
<p>at those high levels can really be helpful</p>
<p>in terms of increasing sperm count, testosterone,</p>
<p>and even testicular size of all things.</p>
<p>So one important point about taking zinc,</p>
<p>this 120 milligrams of zinc two times daily</p>
<p>definitely needs to be done with meals.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever taken zinc on an empty stomach,</p>
<p>even if you just take 15 or 30 milligrams of zinc,</p>
<p>you can feel very nauseous, not well for a few hours.</p>
<p>So make sure that you&rsquo;re taking zinc with full meals.</p>
<p>So this would mean that you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>in at least two full meals per day.</p>
<p>I should also mention that zinc supplementation</p>
<p>did not appear to impact</p>
<p>gonadotropin-releasing hormone or prolactin.</p>
<p>So it seems to be a fairly targeted effect</p>
<p>on the testosterone and related pathways in males.</p>
<p>As far as I know,</p>
<p>there have not been systematic explorations</p>
<p>of the effects of high levels of zinc administration</p>
<p>on females.</p>
<p>I would hope that those studies would soon be done.</p>
<p>But meanwhile, if you&rsquo;re a male</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re interested in improving sperm quality</p>
<p>and your testosterone levels overall for whatever reason,</p>
<p>zinc likely is a good candidate.</p>
<p>And that pretty much summarizes the compounds</p>
<p>that men and women should take</p>
<p>in order to maximize egg quality,</p>
<p>sperm quality, and fertility.</p>
<p>And then of course, we start to enter the landscape</p>
<p>of other things that men and women can take</p>
<p>in order to improve fertility.</p>
<p>And those other things generally are prescription drugs.</p>
<p>And so I just want to mention what a few of those are.</p>
<p>But of course, these are things</p>
<p>that you would absolutely have to obtain prescriptions</p>
<p>for from your MD.</p>
<p>And your MD would, without question,</p>
<p>would want to take blood tests</p>
<p>prior to prescribing these things.</p>
<p>So for instance,</p>
<p>if men have been taking exogenous testosterone</p>
<p>through the use of anabolic steroids</p>
<p>like performance enhancing drugs</p>
<p>or even testosterone replacement therapy,</p>
<p>their endogenous testosterone levels</p>
<p>are going to be very low</p>
<p>and their sperm counts are going to be very low</p>
<p>unless for instance,</p>
<p>they are prescribed and taking something like HCG,</p>
<p>human chorionic gonadotropin,</p>
<p>which mimics LH and would stimulate the testes</p>
<p>to produce testosterone</p>
<p>and through some indirect pathways,</p>
<p>rescue spermatogenesis,</p>
<p>although not to the same degree</p>
<p>as if people are not taking exogenous sources</p>
<p>of testosterone.</p>
<p>Some men, even if they&rsquo;ve never touched TRT</p>
<p>or exogenous testosterone of any kind</p>
<p>will be prescribed to take HCG</p>
<p>because of its ability to stimulate the testes</p>
<p>to produce more testosterone in sperm.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re just taking HCG alone.</p>
<p>Other men will take or will be prescribed rather FSH</p>
<p>in order to stimulate spermatogenesis or HCG and FSH</p>
<p>or clomiphene, which can regulate all sorts of things</p>
<p>in the both testosterone and estrogen related pathways</p>
<p>at the level of brain and pituitary and gonad, testes.</p>
<p>Likewise for women, if they&rsquo;re low in FSH,</p>
<p>they might be prescribed FSH.</p>
<p>If they are low in luteinizing hormone,</p>
<p>they might be prescribed HCG.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re low in testosterone,</p>
<p>they might even be prescribed testosterone</p>
<p>and if their testosterone is too high</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re dealing with PCOS,</p>
<p>they might be prescribed antiandrogens</p>
<p>and androgen blockers and on and on and on.</p>
<p>There are so many different hormones</p>
<p>that can impact the different aspects</p>
<p>of the ovulatory and the spermatogenesis cycle</p>
<p>that the OBGYNs and the urologists</p>
<p>focus on male fertility nowadays</p>
<p>really have an excellent handle on which levers</p>
<p>and buttons and threads to pull and push and so forth</p>
<p>in order to set in motion a proper ovulatory cycle</p>
<p>and a proper spermatogenesis cycle.</p>
<p>You know, everything we talked about up until now</p>
<p>and in the early phase of this episode,</p>
<p>especially about how the brain commands the pituitary</p>
<p>and the pituitary commands the gonads</p>
<p>and then the gonads, the ovary or the testes</p>
<p>send feedback signals to the pituitary</p>
<p>to then influence the pituitary.</p>
<p>All of that incredible orchestra,</p>
<p>that dance is so tightly regulated</p>
<p>in a way that really provides the OBGYNs</p>
<p>and the fertility docs concerned with male fertility</p>
<p>exceptional tools to, for instance,</p>
<p>figure out if a man is not producing any sperm</p>
<p>but his testosterone levels are well within normal range.</p>
<p>Well, then there&rsquo;s some very clear sets of explorations</p>
<p>and potential treatments, some of which are mechanical,</p>
<p>making sure the epididymis and vas deferens are clear,</p>
<p>allowing the sperm to enter the ejaculate</p>
<p>and the ejaculate to enter the urethra</p>
<p>and obviously to enter the female,</p>
<p>as well as for a woman who&rsquo;s not ovulating</p>
<p>to adjust her levels of FSH</p>
<p>or maybe even to apply acupuncture in conjunction</p>
<p>with supplementation and various prescription hormone</p>
<p>therapies to adjust fertility and ovulation</p>
<p>and the probability of successful pregnancy.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a vast landscape of prescription drugs</p>
<p>and surgical interventions of varying degrees</p>
<p>of invasiveness and some are, for instance,</p>
<p>outpatient procedures, some require general anesthesia,</p>
<p>et cetera, in order to maximize male and female fertility.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve tried to do today is to provide you</p>
<p>with a deep dive understanding</p>
<p>of the ovulatory and menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>We talked about the brain, the pituitary, the ovary,</p>
<p>the fallopian tubes, and in fact,</p>
<p>the whole female reproductive axis</p>
<p>as it relates to fertility and reproduction.</p>
<p>I also described the male reproductive axis</p>
<p>as it relates to the brain, the pituitary, the gonad,</p>
<p>the testes, and the various ducts,</p>
<p>the pathways out of the testes that allow the sperm</p>
<p>to be enriched within the semen,</p>
<p>and then the semen and the ejaculate</p>
<p>to exit through the urethra.</p>
<p>I did all that as a way to frame the various tools</p>
<p>and interventions that can really assist</p>
<p>in increasing fertility, egg quality, and sperm quality.</p>
<p>So when we discuss mitochondria in the context</p>
<p>of the development of an egg or the development of sperm</p>
<p>and its ability to swim quickly forward,</p>
<p>now it should make sense as to why a given intervention,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s L-carnitine</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s exercise</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s getting enough sleep</p>
<p>and limiting stress, why all that should matter</p>
<p>and why in fact mechanistically</p>
<p>those interventions can work.</p>
<p>Because indeed there are many interventions</p>
<p>that we can all do and use to support our fertility.</p>
<p>And again, as a more general theme today,</p>
<p>I really wanted to A,</p>
<p>teach you about the human reproductive axis.</p>
<p>I do find the biology of the ovulatory and menstrual cycle</p>
<p>and spermatogenesis to be absolutely fascinating to me.</p>
<p>And again, if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s interested</p>
<p>in conceiving or if you&rsquo;ve already conceived children,</p>
<p>and even if you don&rsquo;t want more children,</p>
<p>this is really the aspect of our biology</p>
<p>that allowed us to be here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the aspect of our biology</p>
<p>that determined whether or not we are male or female.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the aspect of our biology that determines so, so much.</p>
<p>And yet I think that most of us</p>
<p>generally are not taught this in school</p>
<p>or at least not at the depth that we discussed it today.</p>
<p>So hopefully that information was in and of itself</p>
<p>interesting and perhaps useful as well.</p>
<p>And I do think that even if people are not wishing</p>
<p>to conceive more children,</p>
<p>that the information related to fertility</p>
<p>and optimizing egg and sperm health</p>
<p>is a value in the sense that optimizing egg and sperm health</p>
<p>can be used as a proxy</p>
<p>for optimizing our body and brain health generally.</p>
<p>In other words, and here I&rsquo;m admittedly taking</p>
<p>words out of the mouths of the various wonderful doctors,</p>
<p>the OBGYNs and urologists that helped inform me</p>
<p>in anticipation of this episode,</p>
<p>what is good for the woman is good for the egg</p>
<p>and for fertility and for pregnancy.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s good for the man</p>
<p>is good for the quality and production of sperm</p>
<p>and for fertility and pregnancy.</p>
<p>Put differently, whether or not we are male or female,</p>
<p>the things that we can do to optimize our fertility</p>
<p>are the exact same things that we should all be doing</p>
<p>to optimize our vitality and our longevity.</p>
<p>And I realized today&rsquo;s episode was so much the deep dive</p>
<p>and fairly broad as well,</p>
<p>that it ended up being fairly long and extensive.</p>
<p>And yet we still have not touched on</p>
<p>any of the important themes</p>
<p>that I know a number of people want to know about.</p>
<p>So for instance, menopause, andropause, PCOS,</p>
<p>and other themes related to hormones</p>
<p>and reproductive function and biology.</p>
<p>And I promise that we will have episodes,</p>
<p>both solo episodes and episodes with expert guests</p>
<p>in the future to cover all of those topics in detail.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the information discussed in today&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>should serve as a basic foundation</p>
<p>for those discussions going forward.</p>
<p>And hopefully we&rsquo;re of interest to you in their own right.</p>

<p>And on both Spotify and Apple,</p>
<p>you can leave us up to a five-star review.</p>
<p>If you have questions or comments about the podcast</p>
<p>or guests that you&rsquo;d like me to bring</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>please put those questions and suggestions</p>
<p>in the comment section on YouTube.</p>
<p>I do read all the comments.</p>
<p>In addition, please check out the sponsors mentioned</p>
<p>at the beginning and throughout today&rsquo;s episode.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>During today&rsquo;s episode and on many previous episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast, we discuss supplements.</p>
<p>While supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>for things like sleep, hormone augmentation,</p>
<p>focus, and much more.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab podcast is now partnered</p>
<p>with Momentous Supplements,</p>
<p>because as mentioned at the beginning of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>Momentous Supplements are of the very highest quality.</p>
<p>They ship internationally,</p>
<p>and they have single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>that allow you to develop the most biologically effective</p>
<p>and cost-effective supplement regimen for you.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements discussed</p>
<p>on today&rsquo;s and other Huberman Lab podcasts,</p>
<p>please go to LiveMomentous, spelled O-U-S,</p>
<p>so livemomentous.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not already following us on social media,</p>
<p>please do so.</p>
<p>We are Huberman Lab on Instagram, Twitter,</p>
<p>Facebook, and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>And at all of those places,</p>
<p>I discuss science and science-related tools,</p>
<p>some of which overlap with the contents</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>but much of which is distinct from the content</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.</p>
<p>And if you haven&rsquo;t already subscribed to our newsletter,</p>
<p>we have a zero cost newsletter.</p>
<p>It is called the Neural Network Newsletter,</p>
<p>and each month it includes things like podcast summaries</p>
<p>and toolkits for things like sleep, focus,</p>
<p>dopamine optimization, fitness, and so on.</p>
<p>You can sign up for the newsletter,</p>
<p>again, completely zero cost by going to HubermanLab.com,</p>
<p>go to the menu, go to newsletter.</p>
<p>You provide your email, and we do not share your email.</p>
<p>And again, the newsletter is completely zero cost.</p>
<p>Thank you once again for joining me for today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>all about the biology surrounding this incredible thing</p>
<p>that we call fertility,</p>
<p>including the ovulatory cycle, spermatogenesis,</p>
<p>fertilization itself,</p>
<p>and all the events leading up to pregnancy.</p>
<p>And last, but certainly not least,</p>
<p>thank you for your interest in science.</p>
