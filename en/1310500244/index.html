    <p>The following is a conversation with Neal Stephenson, a legendary science fiction writer</p>
<p>exploring ideas in mathematics, science, cryptography, money, linguistics, philosophy, and virtual</p>
<p>reality, from his early book Snow Crash to his new one called Termination Shock.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t just write novels.</p>
<p>He worked at the space company Blue Origin for many years, including technically being</p>
<p>Blue Origin&rsquo;s first employee.</p>
<p>He also was the chief futurist at the virtual reality company Magic Leap.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Neal Stephenson.</p>
<p>You write both historical fiction, like World War II in Cryptonomicon, and science fiction,</p>
<p>looking both into the past and the future.</p>
<p>So let me ask, does history repeat itself, in which way does it repeat itself, in which</p>
<p>way does it not?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid it repeats itself a lot.</p>
<p>So I think human nature kind of is what it is.</p>
<p>And so we tend to see similar behavior patterns emerging again and again.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s kind of the exception rather than the rule when something new happens.</p>
<p>What role does technology play in the suppression or in revealing human nature?</p>
<p>Well, the standards of living, life expectancy, all that have gotten incredibly better within</p>
<p>the last, particularly the last hundred years.</p>
<p>I mean, just antibiotics, modern vaccines, electrification, the internet.</p>
<p>These are all improvements in most people&rsquo;s standard of living and health and longevity</p>
<p>that exceed anything that was seen before in human history.</p>
<p>So people are living longer, they&rsquo;re generally healthier, and so on.</p>
<p>But again, we still see a lot of the same behavior patterns, some of which are not very</p>
<p>attractive.</p>
<p>So some of it has to do with the constraints on resources, presumably with technology you</p>
<p>have less and less constraints on resources.</p>
<p>So we get to maybe emphasize the better angels of our nature.</p>
<p>And in so doing, does that not potentially fundamentally alter the sort of the experience</p>
<p>that we have of life on earth?</p>
<p>You know, until the last 10 or so years, I would have taken that view, I think.</p>
<p>But you know, people will find ways to be divisive and angry if it scratches a kind</p>
<p>of psychological itch that they have got.</p>
<p>And we used to look at the Weimar Republic, what happened in the economic collapse of</p>
<p>Germany prior to the rise of Hitler, World War II, and kind of explain Hitler, at least</p>
<p>partially by just the misery that people were living in at that time.</p>
<p>The economic collapse.</p>
<p>Yeah, hyperinflation and unemployment and the decline in standard of living.</p>
<p>And that sounds like a plausible explanation.</p>
<p>But there are economic troubles now for sure.</p>
<p>We had the bank collapse in 2008.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s stagnation in some people&rsquo;s standards of living.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s hard to explain what we&rsquo;ve seen in this country in the last few years just strictly</p>
<p>on the basis of people are poor and angry and sad.</p>
<p>I think they want to be angry.</p>
<p>So without being political in a divisive kind of way, can we talk about the lessons you</p>
<p>can draw from World War II?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>This singular event in human history, it seems like, and yet, as you say, history rhymes</p>
<p>at the very least.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Being who I am, I tend to focus on the curious technological things that happened in conjunction</p>
<p>with that war.</p>
<p>Which may not be where you want to go.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s several things.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>So one in Cryptonomicon is more like the Alan Turing side of things, right?</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the outside of technology.</p>
<p>First of all, there&rsquo;s the tools of war, which is a kind of technology.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s just like the human nature, the nature of good and evil.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, so one of the things that emerges from the war and from the extermination camps is</p>
<p>that we were never allowed to have illusions anymore about human nature.</p>
<p>So you have to learn that lesson to be an educated person, and you have to know that</p>
<p>even in a supposedly enlightened, civilized society, people can become monsters quite</p>
<p>easily.</p>
<p>So that is for sure the big takeaway.</p>
<p>Do you agree with Solzhenitsyn about the line between good and evil runs through the heart</p>
<p>of every man?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That all of us are capable?</p>
<p>Great line.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Of evil?</p>
<p>I read a good chunk of the Gulag Archipelago when I was a teenager because my grandfather</p>
<p>had it in his house because he was one of these Americans who was obsessed with the</p>
<p>Soviet Union and the Soviet threat and wanted people to be aware of some of what had happened.</p>
<p>And so he had those books lying around and I would read them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a similar kind of parallel story to what happened in Germany during the war,</p>
<p>this creation of this system of camps and oppression and lots of troubling behavior.</p>
<p>To me it&rsquo;s a story of how fear and desperation combined with a charismatic leader can lead</p>
<p>to evil.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also a story of bravery, of love, of brotherhood and sisterhood and basically</p>
<p>survival.</p>
<p>You have a man&rsquo;s search for meaning, which is the story of a man in a concentration camp</p>
<p>basically finding beauty in life even under most extreme conditions.</p>
<p>So to me World War II is not necessarily a bleak view of human nature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little moment of evil that revealed a much bigger good in humanity.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not so sure that it leads me to a pessimistic view of the world, the fact that somebody</p>
<p>like Hitler could happen, the fact that a lot of people could follow Hitler and get</p>
<p>excited and maybe even love the hate of the other for some moment of time.</p>
<p>I think all of us are capable of that, but I think all of us also have a capacity for</p>
<p>good.</p>
<p>And I think, I don&rsquo;t know what you think, but I think we have a greater desire for good</p>
<p>than evil.</p>
<p>And it seems like that&rsquo;s where technology is very useful as a guide, as a helping hand.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Can you give me an example maybe?</p>
<p>So I give you examples of futuristic technologies and I can give you examples of current technologies.</p>
<p>Current technologies, knowledge in the form of very basic knowledge, which is like Wikipedia</p>
<p>and search the original dream of Google that I think is very much a success, which is making</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s information accessible at your fingertips.</p>
<p>That kind of technology enables the natural, if this axiom, this assumption that people</p>
<p>want to do good is true, then letting them discover all of the information out there,</p>
<p>false information and true information, all of it, and let them explore that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>lead to a better world, to better people.</p>
<p>Fascist technologies is, I personally, I mentioned to you offline, sort of love artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>And so AI that&rsquo;s an assistant, that&rsquo;s a guide, like a mentor to you, that you can in the</p>
<p>way that Google searches, but smarter, where you can help send it out and say, this is</p>
<p>the direction in which I want to grow, not authoritarian lecturing down from the algorithm</p>
<p>of telling you this is how you should grow, but almost the opposite, where you use it</p>
<p>as an assistant, a servant in your journey towards knowledge.</p>
<p>That sounds like an easy thing, but it&rsquo;s actually from an AI perspective very difficult.</p>
<p>I mean, this is the theme of a book I wrote called The Diamond Age, which talks about</p>
<p>a book that essentially does that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been sort of watching people try to come at the problem of building that thing</p>
<p>from different directions for ever since the book came out, basically.</p>
<p>And so I kind of have, although I haven&rsquo;t worked on it myself, I do get a sense of the</p>
<p>level of difficulty in realizing that goal.</p>
<p>So that book is in the 90s, so as Google is coming to be, it&rsquo;s essentially not Google,</p>
<p>but the search engine, the initial search engines, which gave birth to Google essentially</p>
<p>in contrast.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That was still in the era of Alta Vista and Ask Jeeves and multiple different search engines.</p>
<p>And yeah, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I had not heard of Google at that point.</p>
<p>That would have been 95, 96.</p>
<p>I think the book came out in 94.</p>
<p>And then, of course, the social networks followed, which is another form of guidance through</p>
<p>the space of information.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, what happens is that these things come along and then people find ways to game them.</p>
<p>And so I saw an interesting thread the other day pointing out that 20 years ago, if you</p>
<p>had Googled Pythagorean theorem, chances are you would have been taken directly to a page</p>
<p>explaining the Pythagorean theorem.</p>
<p>If you do it now, you&rsquo;re probably going to&hellip;</p>
<p>The top hits are going to be from somebody who&rsquo;s got an angle, who&rsquo;s got a scheme, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to sell you math tutoring or they&rsquo;re working some kind of marketing plan</p>
<p>on you.</p>
<p>So the traditional engines become actually less useful over time for their original educational</p>
<p>purpose.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that they shouldn&rsquo;t be replaced by newer and better ones.</p>
<p>First of all, to defend the people with the angle, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to find business models to fund, oftentimes, which is funny you went</p>
<p>with Pythagorean, like you went at math, those greedy bastards, but it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>How can we monetize the Pythagorean theorem?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, education, right, is just to figure out like people who love math education,</p>
<p>for example, love it purely, not purely, but very often love it for itself, for just teaching</p>
<p>math.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because, you know, when coming face to face with, for example, like the YouTube algorithm,</p>
<p>they start to try to figure out, okay, how can I make money off of this?</p>
<p>The primary goal is still that love of education, but they also want to make that love of education</p>
<p>their full time job.</p>
<p>But I see that sort of that dance of humanity with the algorithms as it finds this kind</p>
<p>of local pocket of optimality, or suboptimality, whatever, it gets stuck in it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pocket of some sort.</p>
<p>But I see that pocket as way better than what we had before in the 80s, right, or the 90s</p>
<p>before the internet.</p>
<p>But like, and now we&rsquo;re now, this is also human nature, we start writing very eloquent</p>
<p>articles about how this pocket is clearly a pocket, it&rsquo;s not very good, and we can imagine</p>
<p>much better lands far beyond, but the reality is it&rsquo;s better than before, and now we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>waiting for a new book.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you have to wait either for lone geniuses or for some kind of momentum of a group of</p>
<p>geniuses that just say, enough is enough, I have an idea, this is how we get out.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s too easy to be sort of, I think, partially because you can get a lot of clicks</p>
<p>in your articles being cynical about being in this pocket, and we are forever stuck in</p>
<p>this pocket, and then coming up with this grandiose theory that humanity has finally,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s collapsing, stuck forever like a prison in this pocket, but reality, it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>clickbait articles and books until one curious ant comes up with the next pocket.</p>
<p>Yeah, tunnels through the barrier or gets enough energy to jump over the barrier.</p>
<p>And eventually we&rsquo;ll be, as you&rsquo;ve talked about, I mean, we&rsquo;ll colonize the solar system,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll be stuck in the solar system, and then people will say, well, we&rsquo;re screwed</p>
<p>because when the sun energy runs out, there&rsquo;s no way to get to the next solar system, and</p>
<p>so on.</p>
<p>It goes on until we colonize the entirety of the observable universe.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think getting out of the solar system is going to be a hard one.</p>
<p>So can you, you mentioned this, can you elaborate why you think, back to sort of a serious question,</p>
<p>why do you think it&rsquo;s hard to get outside of our solar system?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just an energy calculation.</p>
<p>I mean, you can do it slowly whenever you want, but the idea of getting there in one</p>
<p>lifetime or a few lifetimes requires huge amounts of energy to accelerate.</p>
<p>And then as soon as you get halfway there, you need to expend an equal amount of energy</p>
<p>to decelerate, or you&rsquo;ll just go shooting by.</p>
<p>And so that means carrying a lot of energy.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s ideas like Yuri Milner, I think, is still funding the idea to use laser propulsion</p>
<p>to send something to another star system, a small object.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;ll have no way to slow down, as far as I know.</p>
<p>They never talk about that part, like how do we slow down?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a quick flyby to take a good picture, I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah, you better take some good pictures on your way by.</p>
<p>So, and that&rsquo;s great if it happens, I&rsquo;m not knocking it.</p>
<p>But the amount of energy that&rsquo;s needed is just staggering, and there&rsquo;s other issues</p>
<p>like just how do you maintain an ecosystem for that long in isolation?</p>
<p>How do you prevent people from going crazy?</p>
<p>What happens if you hit something while traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of</p>
<p>light?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s sort of some combination of expanding human lifespan, but also just good old fashioned,</p>
<p>stable society on a spaceship.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, the generation ship.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>No, I think that&rsquo;s the only way.</p>
<p>It would have to keep going for a long time.</p>
<p>And they might get to where they&rsquo;re going and find a shitty solar system.</p>
<p>We can try to do some advanced survey, but if you get there and all the planets in that</p>
<p>solar system are just garbage planets, then it&rsquo;s kind of a big let down for this like</p>
<p>thousand year voyage that you&rsquo;ve just been on, right?</p>
<p>So we have a pretty narrow range of parameters that we need to stay between in order to survive</p>
<p>in terms of the gravitational field that we can deal with.</p>
<p>So that sets a bound on the size of the planet and what we need in the way of temperature</p>
<p>and atmosphere and so on.</p>
<p>So when you look at all those complications, then basically building sort of exactly the</p>
<p>environment we want out of available materials in this solar system starts to look a hell</p>
<p>of a lot better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to make an economic argument, let&rsquo;s say, for making that journey.</p>
<p>One of the things I like about the expanse is the fact that the people who are trying</p>
<p>to build the starship to go to the other solar system are doing it for religious reasons.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the only reason that you would do it because economically it just makes more</p>
<p>sense to build rotating cylindrical space habitats and make them perfect.</p>
<p>Well, isn&rsquo;t everything done for religious reasons?</p>
<p>Like why do we exploration?</p>
<p>Why do we go to the moon again and do the other things?</p>
<p>What does JFK said is not because they&rsquo;re easy, but because they&rsquo;re hard.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that kind of a religious reason?</p>
<p>I knew a veteran of the Apollo program who once said that the Apollo moon landings were</p>
<p>communism&rsquo;s greatest achievement.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the conflict between nations is a kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>Not exactly a religion, but it&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a struggle for meaning and that meaning isn&rsquo;t found in some kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to find meaning in mathematics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s found in some kind of in music and religion, whatever, art.</p>
<p>Some people do, but those are probably not enough of them to&hellip;</p>
<p>People that find meaning in mathematics, they usually find meaning between the lines nevertheless,</p>
<p>not in the actual proving some kind of thing.</p>
<p>So from a cost perspective, do you actually see a possible future where we&rsquo;re building</p>
<p>these kind of generation ships and just why not launch them one a year out like wandering</p>
<p>ants out into the galaxy?</p>
<p>I have nothing against it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, like I said, it&rsquo;s got the motivation to do it has to come from some kind of spiritual</p>
<p>or kind of non tangible calculus.</p>
<p>So from a business model perspective, you don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a business model there?</p>
<p>No, no way.</p>
<p>One of the many fascinating things you&rsquo;ve done in your life, you were at the very beginning,</p>
<p>you were the person that convinced Jeff Bezos to start a spaceship company, a space company.</p>
<p>You were there at Blue Origin for a few years in the beginning working on alternate propulsion</p>
<p>systems and at least according to Wikipedia, alternate business models.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, to go back to the first thing you said, Jeff Bezos is not a guy who required</p>
<p>a lot of convincing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d been thinking about it since he was five years old and it was an inevitability.</p>
<p>But the idea that kind of got hatched in 1999 was to just do some advanced scouting work,</p>
<p>explore the corners of the space of possibilities.</p>
<p>And so that was Blue Operations LLC, which was the precursor to Blue Origin.</p>
<p>And so it was a small staff of people that did that for a few years.</p>
<p>And I think it was about 2003, 2004 that it swung decisively towards the direction it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been following ever since, which is using basically existing aerospace technologies</p>
<p>and models to make chemical fueled rockets for space tourism.</p>
<p>I believe and I continue to believe that the fact that we use chemical rockets is just</p>
<p>an accident of history that comes out of World War II.</p>
<p>So until World War II, rockets are being built on a small scale by people like Robert Goddard.</p>
<p>But then Hitler desperately wants to bomb London, but he can&rsquo;t quite reach it and the</p>
<p>Luftwaffe has been kind of neutralized.</p>
<p>So he decides he&rsquo;s going to lob warheads into it with rockets, which is a terrible misallocation</p>
<p>of resources.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a terrible idea.</p>
<p>So it only could have happened in a dictatorship controlled by a lunatic.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the situation that existed.</p>
<p>So they built these rockets, that&rsquo;s the V2.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s just a complete coincidence that that war ends with atomic bombs being</p>
<p>developed in a completely separate super weapon program.</p>
<p>And so suddenly the existence of the bombs creates a demand for rockets that didn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>before because if you&rsquo;ve got atomic bombs, you need a way to deliver them.</p>
<p>You can do it with bombers, but it&rsquo;s a lot better to just hurl them to the other side</p>
<p>of the world on the top of a rocket.</p>
<p>So suddenly rockets, which had gotten a boost because of Hitler&rsquo;s V2 program, got a much</p>
<p>bigger boost during the 50s and 60s.</p>
<p>And it is a complete, you&rsquo;re right, for some reason I never thought of this, it is an accident</p>
<p>of history that nuclear weapons are developed at a similar time.</p>
<p>First of all, nuclear weapons didn&rsquo;t have to be developed at the same time as World</p>
<p>War II.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an accident in history.</p>
<p>And then the fact, okay, so then Hitler started using rockets, that&rsquo;s an accident of, okay,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fascinating set of coincidences.</p>
<p>Yeah, which is true of a lot of technologies, by the way.</p>
<p>By the time these rockets are kind of working, we&rsquo;ve got hydrogen bombs that are so big and</p>
<p>so devastating that nobody really wants to use them.</p>
<p>But it turns out you can fit a capsule with a couple of people in it into the socket on</p>
<p>the end of a missile that was made to hold a hydrogen bomb.</p>
<p>So we start doing that instead as a proxy for having a war.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to be in the meeting where the first guy brought that up as an idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably a Russian.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we strap a person to the rocket?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, it probably was because they did it first, right?</p>
<p>The Russians did it first.</p>
<p>And they had perhaps less respect for sort of safety protocols.</p>
<p>Could be.</p>
<p>They were a little bit more willing to sacrifice the life of an astronaut or to risk the life</p>
<p>of an astronaut.</p>
<p>Could be.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>This is basically the story of how through all of this competition and because of these</p>
<p>historical accidents, trillions of R&amp;D dollars and rubles were put into development of chemical</p>
<p>rocket technology, which has now advanced to an incredibly high degree.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s other ways to make things go really fast, which is all that rockets do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all orbit is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just going really fast.</p>
<p>And because so many nerds are obsessed with space, people have been thinking about alternate</p>
<p>schemes for as long as they&rsquo;ve been thinking about rockets.</p>
<p>And so one of the first things that I learned kind of trying to explore new possibilities</p>
<p>was that I could put all of my brainpower to work and be creative as I could and invent</p>
<p>some idea that I thought was new for making things go fast.</p>
<p>And I would always find out that some guy in Russia or somewhere had thought the same</p>
<p>idea up 50 years ago and figured out all the math.</p>
<p>And so at a certain point, you give up on trying to invent completely new ideas and</p>
<p>just go poking around trying to find those guys.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a number of ideas that we looked at.</p>
<p>Some are crazier, some are less crazy.</p>
<p>And the direction that that company eventually took was chemical rockets.</p>
<p>Is there something you can comment on possible ideas?</p>
<p>So first of all, you could use nuclear, so nuclear propulsion.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I mean, you&rsquo;ve probably heard of Project Orion, which was the&hellip;</p>
<p>Freeman Dyson and some of his collaborators had a scheme to power a large space vehicle</p>
<p>by detonating atomic bombs behind it.</p>
<p>And so one of the other people who was working at Blue Operations during this time was George</p>
<p>Dyson, the son of Freeman.</p>
<p>And so we knew all about Project Orion and he found an old film that they&rsquo;d shot on a</p>
<p>beach in La Jolla of a prototype of this that was powered by like lumps of C4.</p>
<p>So that was an idea, but for a private company, obtaining a large number of atomic bombs was</p>
<p>probably out of scope.</p>
<p>So it was more of a theoretical thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a conceptually similar approach using lasers that Freeman worked on with Arthur</p>
<p>Kantrowitz and some others, where you take a pulsed laser and you fire it at a vehicle</p>
<p>that has a block of ice on the back.</p>
<p>And the pulse hits the ice and flashes off a layer of steam that becomes plasma.</p>
<p>And plasma is opaque because it conducts.</p>
<p>And so being opaque, it then absorbs all of the energy from the laser pulse and gets</p>
<p>really hot and just pushes on the back of the block of ice.</p>
<p>And then you wait a moment for that to dissipate and then you do it again.</p>
<p>So it would just kind of vibrate its way.</p>
<p>Like it sounds really violent, but Freeman said that if you were wearing like rubber</p>
<p>sold tennis shoes standing in this vehicle, you would just feel a mild vibration.</p>
<p>So there your source of energy is on the ground and you&rsquo;re getting higher specific impulse</p>
<p>than you could get by burning chemicals.</p>
<p>Jordan Kerr and others worked on another laser system, the late Dr. Jordan Kerr, that just</p>
<p>would heat up a heat exchanger by many converging solid state lasers from the ground.</p>
<p>And Kevin Parkin works on a similar scheme that just uses microwaves to do that.</p>
<p>We looked at tall towers.</p>
<p>I spent a while looking kind of semi seriously at giant bullwhips.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a bullwhip?</p>
<p>Just a whip, you have them here in Texas, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I understand.</p>
<p>But how does that have to do with propulsion?</p>
<p>If you think about it, a whip is an incredibly simple primitive object that can break the</p>
<p>speed of sound.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s unbelievable in a way that for thousands of years, people with no technology have been</p>
<p>able to accelerate objects through the speed of sound just through an architectural trick.</p>
<p>Just the physics of a moving bend of material in a medium can do this.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the thing I still think about from time to time.</p>
<p>You can use the same physics to make freestanding loops of chain or other flexible materials</p>
<p>that just kind of stand up under their own physics.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of awesome to imagine.</p>
<p>So imagine using the same kind of physics of a whip, but have at the end of it a spaceship.</p>
<p>That would detach at the moment of maximum velocity.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t that?</p>
<p>So part of my motivation in studying that was to ask that question.</p>
<p>It was more almost a symbolic way of saying, look, there&rsquo;s all kinds of physics we haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>explored yet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no more crazy than the idea of chemical rockets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that more money&rsquo;s gone into chemical rockets, right?</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question on propulsion that&rsquo;s a little bit more out there?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen quite a lot of recent articles and reports and so on about</p>
<p>UFOs, like the Tic Tac aircraft.</p>
<p>I keep seeing a lot of chatter about it, but I haven&rsquo;t gone deep into it.</p>
<p>So the DOD released footage filmed by pilots, and there&rsquo;s a lot of reports about objects</p>
<p>that moved in ways they haven&rsquo;t seen before that seem to defy the laws of physics if we</p>
<p>consider the aircraft that we have today.</p>
<p>So the reason I asked you that is because it kind of, to me, whatever the heck it is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s inspiring for the possibilities of ideas for propulsion.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s like secret projects from foreign nations or it&rsquo;s physical phenomena that we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t yet understand, like ball lightning, all those kinds of things, or if it is aliens</p>
<p>or objects from an alien civilization.</p>
<p>I most likely believe if it&rsquo;s an object from an alien civilization, it&rsquo;s got to be like</p>
<p>a really dumb drone that just got lost.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely not like the pinnacle of intelligence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like some teenager&rsquo;s science fair experiment.</p>
<p>Yeah, it just flew for a few centuries out and just landed, and then we humans are all</p>
<p>like really excited about this wild thing.</p>
<p>I mean, what do you think about those&hellip;</p>
<p>First of all, like the millions of reports of UFOs, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some psychology there that&rsquo;s deeply cultural, but also the possibility of aliens</p>
<p>having visited Earth.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I&rsquo;d like to see some better pictures.</p>
<p>For the reason I mentioned earlier, having to do with the difficulty of traveling between</p>
<p>star systems, it&rsquo;s really hard for me to believe it&rsquo;s aliens.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t understand why you would go to all that trouble to transport something across</p>
<p>light years and then do what these UFOs are allegedly doing.</p>
<p>Like how is that interesting?</p>
<p>How does that justify the trip?</p>
<p>So if you travel across those kinds of distances, you would make a bigger splash.</p>
<p>First of all, I would expect that the arrival of these things would be something we&rsquo;d notice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got to decelerate into our solar system unless it got here really, really, really</p>
<p>slowly.</p>
<p>So I guess that&rsquo;s a possibility and just kind of snuck in.</p>
<p>So at the end, we would detect some kind of footprint in terms of energy.</p>
<p>You would think.</p>
<p>So I actually think your idea of a science fair project gone bad, it makes more sense</p>
<p>in that it would explain why if these things are alien technologies, they&rsquo;re just kind</p>
<p>of hanging around our aircraft carriers for no particular reason, like not trying to communicate.</p>
<p>Can you imagine a scenario where aliens have visited Earth or are visiting Earth and we</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t notice it at all?</p>
<p>Oh, sure.</p>
<p>I mean, if they&rsquo;ve got technology to get here, they&rsquo;ve probably got technology to conceal</p>
<p>the fact that they&rsquo;re trying to conceal themselves.</p>
<p>I meant more like they&rsquo;re not trying to conceal themselves, but we&rsquo;re just our cognitive capabilities</p>
<p>are like too limited and we are not thinking big enough.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking for little green men, we&rsquo;re looking for things that operate at a time</p>
<p>scale that&rsquo;s human like, you know.</p>
<p>I love thinking about ideas like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great science fiction novel fodder that the aliens are so different that we simply</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t see them.</p>
<p>Is there, in terms of language, do you think it would be difficult, not aliens visiting</p>
<p>us but traveling to other places to find a common language?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve written about the importance of language in intelligent civilizations.</p>
<p>How difficult is the problem to bridge the gap between aliens and humans in terms of</p>
<p>language so we&rsquo;re not lost in translation?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s different takes on that depending on how biologically similar they</p>
<p>are to us, you know.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a school of thought that says, basically, advanced life has to be carbon</p>
<p>based for just reasons of chemistry.</p>
<p>So right away, if you impose that limitation, then you&rsquo;re kind of assuming something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>starting to be biologically similar to us.</p>
<p>So if they&rsquo;re about as big as we are and they kind of move around in space, in a physical</p>
<p>body the way we do, then there&rsquo;s probably a way to solve that communication problem.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re beings of pure energy from Star Trek or something like that, then it&rsquo;s a different</p>
<p>story.</p>
<p>Well, I love thinking about that kind of stuff too.</p>
<p>I mean, consciousness itself may be alien.</p>
<p>I mean, it could be, like you said, beings of pure energy.</p>
<p>I think of life as just complex systems, and the kind of forms those complex systems can</p>
<p>take seems to be much larger than the particular biological systems we see here on Earth.</p>
<p>I have to ask a Twitter question about aliens.</p>
<p>You ready?</p>
<p>This is for Twitter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready.</p>
<p>What would you expect from Twitter?</p>
<p>Can humans have sex with aliens?</p>
<p>Neil Stevenson.</p>
<p>You could pass.</p>
<p>I asked a language question.</p>
<p>Can they communicate?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can they fall in love before sex?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>So which question am I answering?</p>
<p>The sex or the love?</p>
<p>I mean, it depends what is more fundamental to relations across intelligent species.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, sex can mean a lot of things.</p>
<p>So I mean, if you&rsquo;re&hellip;</p>
<p>Your production, right?</p>
<p>You know, in Star Trek, in classic Star Trek, you had to really suspend your disbelief to</p>
<p>think that Spock was half Vulcan and half human, right?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s just not going to work DNA wise.</p>
<p>So if by sex, you mean reproductive sex, then I would say no, unless you go to a panspermia</p>
<p>kind of theory, which is that, you know, humans were seeded onto the planet as part of a galactic,</p>
<p>you know, program of some sort.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re just returning home, hanging out with our old relatives.</p>
<p>Distant cousins.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t seem, you know, it doesn&rsquo;t seem plausible.</p>
<p>We know that humans had sex with Neanderthals, with Denisovans, so you could think of them</p>
<p>as aliens that came from our planet.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a kind of data point, I guess.</p>
<p>But you know, if you broaden your definition of sex to mean any kind of gratifying physical</p>
<p>interaction then sure.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Dancing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how we get to love.</p>
<p>And love can take many forms.</p>
<p>Love can certainly take many forms.</p>
<p>I have to ask you, in terms of space, just looking at where Blue Origin is, looking at</p>
<p>where SpaceX is today, and maybe looking out 10, 20 years out from now, are you impressed</p>
<p>at what&rsquo;s happening?</p>
<p>We just saw William Shatner go up to space.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was just watching his video this morning before I came here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Are you impressed at where things stand today?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, SpaceX in particular has done things that are just unbelievable.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think anyone was anticipating 20 years ago, let&rsquo;s say, when this all started,</p>
<p>just the speed with which they&rsquo;d be able to rack up these incredible achievements.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve kind of even seen a little bit of how the sausage is made and so the difficulty</p>
<p>of doing any kind of space travel, what they&rsquo;ve achieved is just unbelievable.</p>
<p>What about maybe a question about Elon Musk?</p>
<p>Even more than Jeff Bezos, he has a very kind of ambitious vision of this project that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on as a species, of becoming a multi planetary species and becoming that quickly, as soon</p>
<p>as possible, landing on Mars, colonizing Mars.</p>
<p>What do you think of that project?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two questions to ask.</p>
<p>First, the question is, what do you think about the project of colonizing Mars?</p>
<p>And second, what do you think about a human being who is so unapologetically ambitious</p>
<p>at achieving the impossible, what a lot of people would say is impossible?</p>
<p>I think that colonizing Mars is the kind of goal that&rsquo;s easily stated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s catchy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the kind of thing that can inspire people to get involved in a way that some other programs</p>
<p>might not.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s well chosen in that way.</p>
<p>I have technical questions about, there&rsquo;s a problem of perchlorates on the surface of</p>
<p>Mars that&rsquo;s going to be big trouble.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s radiation.</p>
<p>This is known.</p>
<p>What about business questions?</p>
<p>Do you think, because you mentioned sort of going outside of the solar system would best</p>
<p>be done for religious reasons.</p>
<p>What about colonizing Mars?</p>
<p>Can you spin it into a business proposition?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to think of a resource that&rsquo;s on Mars that could be brought back here cheaply</p>
<p>enough to compete with stuff we could just dig out of the ground here or grow here.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if there is a business plan for that or if it&rsquo;s just strictly we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to go there and see what happens.</p>
<p>Maybe again we need communism to get us going, to give us a reason, a little bit of the competition.</p>
<p>Well there&rsquo;s plenty of people who are sufficiently excited by the colonize Mars vision that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>willing to just go all in on it, even if there&rsquo;s not a business plan behind it.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s well chosen.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s probably the only approach to take.</p>
<p>A lot of the, when white people came to this continent and started colonizing it, there</p>
<p>was not a lot of coherent planning.</p>
<p>What plans they did have turned out to be terrible plans.</p>
<p>Trying to come up with plans that extend decades into the future is a waste of time.</p>
<p>So do it for the kind of unexplainable love of the unknown, like the journey towards exploring</p>
<p>the unknown and just kind of keep going.</p>
<p>You saw it with Shatner and his reaction to the flight yesterday.</p>
<p>He, for him that trip was more than worth it just for these intangible reasons.</p>
<p>What did he say?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t watched the video yet.</p>
<p>He was trying to express, talking a lot about the moment where suddenly you kind of rise</p>
<p>above the thin blue blanket of the atmosphere and you&rsquo;re up into the blackness.</p>
<p>And that had a huge impact on him.</p>
<p>So he was kind of, I wouldn&rsquo;t say groping for words because he was pretty eloquent,</p>
<p>but he was trying to express his feelings about that in a way that is pretty gripping</p>
<p>to watch.</p>
<p>So you worked on this kind of stuff, we can go back 10 years ago.</p>
<p>You wrote an essay called Innovation Starvation.</p>
<p>You worked on this kind of idea since then, kind of looking at maybe a little bit cynically</p>
<p>about our age today and our unwillingness to take on big risky projects.</p>
<p>So in the face of that, what do you think of people like Elon Musk?</p>
<p>Because to me, people like that are inspiring and gives you hope in the face of a more kind</p>
<p>of pessimistic perspective of our age.</p>
<p>Yeah, well he&rsquo;s clearly willing to tackle big ambitious projects without a lot of kind</p>
<p>of soul searching or trying to make up his mind, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, let&rsquo;s dig tunnels under cities.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>Step one, make a joke about it on Twitter.</p>
<p>Step two, actually do it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I mean, things have slowed down quite a bit.</p>
<p>Our ability to build things at pace is a lot less than it was, and there&rsquo;s reasons for</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re more concerned with safety and environmental impacts than people were when they were building</p>
<p>some of the great Publixworks projects of the mid 20th century.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re at the point now where even just maintaining the stuff that we&rsquo;ve got is such</p>
<p>a huge project that we need to put big resources into it and good minds into it, or else we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be losing things that we take for granted.</p>
<p>Do you think that there&rsquo;s a lot to be done in the digital space?</p>
<p>You mentioned sort of Wikipedia and knowledge, don&rsquo;t you think there could be a lot of flourishing</p>
<p>in the space of innovation, in terms of innovation in the digital space?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I&rsquo;d like to see that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s where a lot of the brainpower went during the last couple of generations,</p>
<p>because people who might previously have been building rockets or other kinds of hard technologies</p>
<p>ended up instead going into programming, computer science, which is understandable and great.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got structural problems right now in the way social media works that are pretty</p>
<p>severe, and so I certainly hope that we&rsquo;re not, 10 years from now, that we&rsquo;re not exactly</p>
<p>where we are today when it comes to that stuff.</p>
<p>We need to move on.</p>
<p>The beautiful thing about problems is they show you how not to do things, and they give</p>
<p>opportunity to new ideas to flourish and to beat out the ideas of the old, which is a</p>
<p>dream for me to see new social media that beats out the ways of the old.</p>
<p>So I tend to, you perhaps agree that it&rsquo;s not, that it&rsquo;s impossible to do social media</p>
<p>well.</p>
<p>Oh, not at all.</p>
<p>I mean, I listened to your interview with Jaren a couple of weeks ago, and I know Jaren,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve talked about this.</p>
<p>He went hard on me.</p>
<p>He basically said, like, it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>It was very nice.</p>
<p>Well, the last time I kind of paid attention to Jaren&rsquo;s thoughts on it, he was thinking</p>
<p>in terms of that basically there should be micro payments such that if I, by clicking</p>
<p>the like button on something, I&rsquo;m essentially giving valuable intellectual property to Facebook</p>
<p>or Twitter or whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a very large amount of IP, but it&rsquo;s definitely a transfer of information that</p>
<p>when they aggregate it is beneficial to them.</p>
<p>So and now I do remember that he, on his interview with you, was talking about what, data unions</p>
<p>or?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Those are a lot of interesting ideas, but for me, the biggest disagreement was in the</p>
<p>level of cynicism.</p>
<p>He has a distrust and cynicism towards people in Silicon Valley being able to do these kinds</p>
<p>of things.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really, okay, when you have a large crowd of people that are doing things the</p>
<p>wrong way, you should nevertheless maintain optimism because what&rsquo;s important is to find</p>
<p>the one person in that room that&rsquo;s going to do things the right way.</p>
<p>Cynicism is going to completely silence out the whole room.</p>
<p>So he was saying, I&rsquo;ve been here a long time.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known, you know, I understand like how these folks work, they think they&rsquo;re gods</p>
<p>and they know the right way to do things and they will tell you how to do those things.</p>
<p>And that kind of hubris is going to always lead you astray when you are the one who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>engineering the algorithms.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of deep truth to that because algorithms are powerful.</p>
<p>And many people when given power do not do the best of things.</p>
<p>I mean, most, what is it, the old Lincoln line, if you want to test the man&rsquo;s character,</p>
<p>give him power.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that some people are not able to handle the power, that some people</p>
<p>are not able to come up with good ideas that create better social media.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t interpret Jaren&rsquo;s statements as being entirely cynical and hopeless.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s definitely raising, you know, issues of concern.</p>
<p>But he wouldn&rsquo;t be out, you know, writing the books that he&rsquo;s written and talking about</p>
<p>this stuff if he didn&rsquo;t think there was a way.</p>
<p>If he didn&rsquo;t think there was hope, yeah.</p>
<p>And part of it, as you probably know with Jaren, he just loves a good argument.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He just loves to have a little bit of fun.</p>
<p>Well I have to ask you about, I mean, we talked about taking all big, bold, risky ideas.</p>
<p>So in your new book, Termination Shock, it&rsquo;s set here in Texas.</p>
<p>Part of it is, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Most of it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great place to set it.</p>
<p>So in it, the main character, TR McCooligan, a Texas billionaire oil man and truck stop</p>
<p>magnate, decides to solve climate change, to take on climate change by himself.</p>
<p>So this is an interesting philosophical exploration of how to solve climate change from a perspective</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s perhaps different than we&rsquo;ve been thinking about.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t use the word solve, but let&rsquo;s say ameliorate the temporary effects.</p>
<p>But please.</p>
<p>Take on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Take on the challenge.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very interesting, but as, so there&rsquo;s a gradual nature to this process.</p>
<p>And I mean, just like in your book, the power of innovation is something that has saved</p>
<p>us quite a few times in history.</p>
<p>So what role does that play in this gradual process?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So ultimately we don&rsquo;t solve the problem until we get the CO2 out of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>But that is going to take a while.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still adding more.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t even started to reduce the amount.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two possibilities inside to interrupt is reduce the amount that we&rsquo;re putting in</p>
<p>the atmosphere and two is removing what we got in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>We have to do both.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And those are two different kind of efforts in terms of like what&rsquo;s involved.</p>
<p>Because it stays up there.</p>
<p>So I think just last week, China announced that they&rsquo;re going to try to level off their</p>
<p>CO2 emissions in like 2030.</p>
<p>So 2031, they&rsquo;ll only put as much CO2 into the atmosphere as they did in 2030, which</p>
<p>is still a lot of CO2 in 2060, they&rsquo;re saying will be net zero.</p>
<p>So if everyone in the world does that and the PPM of CO2 in the atmosphere by then is</p>
<p>say 450 parts per million, it&rsquo;ll stay at 450 parts per million until we take it out.</p>
<p>And taking it out is hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big, it took us a long time.</p>
<p>We had to empty out huge coal mines and oil reservoirs and burn all that stuff.</p>
<p>We had to chop down forests and dig up peat bogs in order to create all of that CO2.</p>
<p>And so we have to reverse all of those processes somehow in order to remove the CO2 and get</p>
<p>it back down, hopefully into the 200 and some parts per million range where it used to be.</p>
<p>So how about you get a single Texas billionaire to have a massive gun that blasts huge quantities</p>
<p>of sulfur into the upper atmosphere.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s idea number one.</p>
<p>This is called solar geoengineering.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a, we know that it&rsquo;s a possibility on a technical level because volcanoes have</p>
<p>been doing it forever.</p>
<p>So many times in human history, we&rsquo;ve seen a volcanic eruption that was followed by a</p>
<p>global cooling trend that lasted for a couple of years.</p>
<p>And one of these things happened I think in the 60s or 70s in Indonesia and the Australians</p>
<p>sent a plane up into the stratosphere to take some samples of the plume.</p>
<p>And when it came back down, the windscreen of the plane had sort of a deposit on it.</p>
<p>So one of the Australian scientists licked it and reported that it was painfully acid.</p>
<p>So that was our first kind of clue that what was being injected into the stratosphere was</p>
<p>sulfur dioxide.</p>
<p>And so we know then Pinatubo came along in the 90s and did this experiment for us.</p>
<p>So we know that sulfur in the stratosphere, it forms little spherical droplets of sulfuric</p>
<p>acid after it combines with water and those bounce back some of the sun&rsquo;s rays and reduce</p>
<p>the amount of solar energy entering the troposphere, which is where we live.</p>
<p>So we know that it works and we also know that the stuff goes away after a couple of</p>
<p>years.</p>
<p>So it gradually washes out.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not a permanent thing.</p>
<p>The good news, bad news is it&rsquo;s not permanent.</p>
<p>So if you don&rsquo;t like what&rsquo;s happening, you can just stop and wait a couple of years and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get back to where you started.</p>
<p>The bad news if you&rsquo;re in favor of this kind of thing is that you have to keep doing it</p>
<p>forever.</p>
<p>So this guy is one of those, he&rsquo;s read these papers, the TR, the character in the book.</p>
<p>He knows all this and all people who are familiar with climate science kind of know this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty well established fact.</p>
<p>And so he just decides he&rsquo;s going to take action unilaterally and do this.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s different ways to get the sulfur up there, but because it&rsquo;s Texas, he builds</p>
<p>the biggest gun in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just six barrels pointed straight up and he begins firing shells loaded with sulfur</p>
<p>into the stratosphere.</p>
<p>And so the book is about not so much that as how people react to his doing that, what</p>
<p>the political ramifications are around the world because this is an extremely controversial</p>
<p>idea and not everyone&rsquo;s on board with it.</p>
<p>And even if you are willing to consider using a technological intervention, the fact is</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s going to have different effects on different parts of the world.</p>
<p>So some areas may suffer more negatives than positives and they&rsquo;re not going to be happy.</p>
<p>So what do you think, so in his case, in TR&rsquo;s case, he can get around getting permission</p>
<p>from governments.</p>
<p>If we were to look at us facing outside of the story, us facing climate change, where</p>
<p>do you think the solution will come from?</p>
<p>Governments working together or from bold billionaire Texans?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that this kind of intervention is never going to emerge from Western democracies.</p>
<p>This kind of, sorry, government coordinated, which option one?</p>
<p>Solar geoengineering.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>From a government, from a, like those are, I want to sort of the distinction, one is</p>
<p>the idea, the technological idea you&rsquo;re talking about, but two is like who comes up with the</p>
<p>idea and agrees on it, governments or individuals.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If this were to happen, I think it would be either an individual or more likely just some</p>
<p>government somewhere that just decides it&rsquo;s in their interests to unilaterally do this.</p>
<p>And you know, that&rsquo;s not me advocating it, it&rsquo;s just, it would be comparatively so cheap</p>
<p>and easy to implement a solar geoengineering scheme that someone is probably going to do</p>
<p>it once things get bad enough.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that governments will, or Western governments, just because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not, well, we&rsquo;ve seen what happened with vaccines, right?</p>
<p>So getting people to take vaccinations or wear masks, you know, has turned out to be</p>
<p>incredibly hard, even though it might save those people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>See, I blame, that&rsquo;s not Western, that&rsquo;s, I blame failure of leadership there, of leaders</p>
<p>being not coming off as authentic, not being inspiring, uniting, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just that we&rsquo;ve gotten, the leaders we have right now aren&rsquo;t the right people</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve lived through kind of a long stretch of relatively comfortable times.</p>
<p>And it feels like unfortunate if you just look at history, that hard times made great</p>
<p>leaders and easy times make like bureaucrats that are egotistical and greedy and not very</p>
<p>interesting and not very bold.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I think that&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>So, you know, we may be entering one of those interesting times, you know, in the Chinese</p>
<p>curse sense, yeah.</p>
<p>So I could be wrong, but I mean, there&rsquo;ve been some efforts to explore solar geoengineering.</p>
<p>There was a plan to send up some balloons, high altitude balloons to take some measurements</p>
<p>in Scandinavia that got squashed by objections from people who lived up there who were just</p>
<p>opposed to the whole program on principle.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll see a lot more of that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to be a hard program to advocate for just because I think people don&rsquo;t quite</p>
<p>understand how much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere and how far we are from even slowing</p>
<p>down the rate that we&rsquo;re adding more to say nothing of bringing that number down.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a long way out from that.</p>
<p>Do you see in terms of portfolio of solutions, us becoming a multi planetary species as part</p>
<p>of that?</p>
<p>Is this also being a motivator for investing some percent of GDP into becoming a multi</p>
<p>planetary species?</p>
<p>And what percent should that be, you think?</p>
<p>You know, in an indirect way, maybe.</p>
<p>I mean, you know what people will say, which is the same argument that has been leveled</p>
<p>against space exploration since the Apollo program, which is why don&rsquo;t we solve our problems</p>
<p>here on Earth before we spend money going into space.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve never been a believer in that argument.</p>
<p>I think there could be a sense in which the new perspective that could be obtained by</p>
<p>thinking about like if we&rsquo;re thinking about terraforming Mars, changing its atmosphere,</p>
<p>making it more amenable to life and survival.</p>
<p>You could see that maybe changing people&rsquo;s opinions about terraforming the Earth.</p>
<p>There are some dangerous consequences to this particular idea of blasting software of geoengineering.</p>
<p>What do you make of sort of big, bold ideas that are a double edged sword?</p>
<p>Are all ideas like this, all big ideas like this, they have the potential to have highly</p>
<p>beneficial consequences and a potential to have highly destructive consequences?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say all.</p>
<p>I think, you know, going back to what we were talking about earlier, how technology developed</p>
<p>in the 50s and 60s, there was a period of time there when people maybe had unrealistic</p>
<p>ideas about new technology and weren&rsquo;t sufficiently attentive to the possible downsides.</p>
<p>So we got, and there&rsquo;s a reason why, I mean, in the mid 20th century, we saw antibiotics,</p>
<p>we saw the polio vaccine, we saw just simple things like refrigerators in the home.</p>
<p>My grandmother to her dying day called the refrigerator the ice box because when she</p>
<p>grew up, it was a box with ice in it.</p>
<p>So you see all that change and it&rsquo;s largely for the benefit of people.</p>
<p>And so if somebody comes along and says, hey, we&rsquo;re going to build nuclear reactors to make</p>
<p>energy or here&rsquo;s a new chemical called DDT that&rsquo;s going to kill mosquitoes, then it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>easy to just buy into that and not be alert to the possible downsides.</p>
<p>And of course, we know that the way that those early reactors were built and the way that</p>
<p>the supply chain was built to create the fuel and deal with the waste was poorly thought</p>
<p>out and we&rsquo;re still dealing with the resulting problems at places like Hanford in the state</p>
<p>of Washington.</p>
<p>And we know that DDT, although it did kill a lot of insects, also had terrible effects</p>
<p>on bird populations.</p>
<p>So the kind of backlash that happened in the 70s that is still kind of going on is to sort</p>
<p>of assume that everything is a double edged sword and always to look for, we have to absolutely</p>
<p>convince ourselves that the downside isn&rsquo;t going to come back and bite us before we can</p>
<p>adopt any new technology.</p>
<p>And I think the people are overly sensitized to that now.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s funny, depending on the technology, people are a little bit too terrified of certain</p>
<p>technologies, like artificial intelligence is one.</p>
<p>My sense is that the things that they&rsquo;re afraid of aren&rsquo;t the things that are likely going</p>
<p>to happen in terms of negative things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably impossible to predict exactly the unintended negative consequences.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s also interesting is for AI as an example, people don&rsquo;t think enough about the</p>
<p>positive things.</p>
<p>I mean, the same is true with social media.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very popular now, for some reason, to talk about all the negative effects of social</p>
<p>media.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve immediately forgotten how incredible it is to connect across the world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a deep loneliness within all of us, we long to connect and social media, at least</p>
<p>in part, enables that even in its current state.</p>
<p>And all the negative things we see with social media currently are also in part just revealing</p>
<p>the basics of human nature.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t make us worse, it&rsquo;s just bringing it to the surface.</p>
<p>And step one of solving a problem is bringing it to the surface.</p>
<p>The fact that there&rsquo;s a division, the fact that we&rsquo;re easily angered and upset and all</p>
<p>of that, the witch hunts, all those kinds of things, that&rsquo;s human nature and it just</p>
<p>reveals that allowing us to now work on it, it&rsquo;s therapy.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s another example of a technology that&rsquo;s just, we&rsquo;re not considering the positive</p>
<p>effects now and in the future enough of.</p>
<p>I have to ask you about, there&rsquo;s a million things I can ask you about, but virtual reality,</p>
<p>I gotta ask you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve thought about virtual reality, mixed reality quite a bit.</p>
<p>What are the interesting trajectories you see for the proliferation of virtual reality</p>
<p>or mixed reality in the next few years?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I was at Magic Leap for, what, five years.</p>
<p>With the best title of all time.</p>
<p>Oh, thanks.</p>
<p>Chief Futurist?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so I sort of had a little squad of people in Seattle doing what you might call content</p>
<p>R&amp;D, so we&rsquo;re trying to make content for AR, but because it&rsquo;s such a new medium, it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>of an engineering R&amp;D project almost than a creative project.</p>
<p>So it was fascinating to see everything that goes into making an AR system that runs.</p>
<p>So AR, an AR device, if it&rsquo;s really gonna do AR, needs to be running Slam in real time.</p>
<p>And that alone is a big&hellip;</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know, first of all, virtual reality is creating an almost fully</p>
<p>artificial world and putting you inside it.</p>
<p>Augmented reality, AR, is taking the real world and putting stuff on top of that real</p>
<p>world, and when you say Slam, that means in real time, the device needs to be able to</p>
<p>sense, accurately detect everything about that world sufficiently to be able to reconstruct</p>
<p>the 3D structure of it so you can put stuff on top of it.</p>
<p>And doing that in real time, presumably not just real time, but in a way that creates</p>
<p>a pleasant experience for the human perception system is, yeah, that&rsquo;s an engineering project.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, well said, and it&rsquo;s just one of the things that the system has to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also tracking your eyes so it knows what you&rsquo;re looking at, how far away what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking at is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s performing all those functions, and it&rsquo;s got to keep doing that without burning up</p>
<p>the CPU or depleting the battery unreasonably fast, and that&rsquo;s just table stakes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the basic functions of the operating system, and then any content that you want</p>
<p>to add has to sit on top of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got to be rendered by the optics at a sufficiently low latency that it looks real</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t get sick.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an amazing thing, and a magically shipped device that can do that in 2019.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re about to ship the ML2, but I don&rsquo;t know any more about that than anyone else</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t work there anymore.</p>
<p>Does it still, to some degree, boil down to a killer app, a content question?</p>
<p>Like you said, it&rsquo;s kind of a wide open space.</p>
<p>Nobody knows exactly what&rsquo;s going to be the compelling thing.</p>
<p>So doesn&rsquo;t a super compelling experience of some sort alleviate some of the need for engineering</p>
<p>perfection?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a base layer of engineering that you have to have no matter what, but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re certainly right that people, like in the early days of video games, put up with</p>
<p>kind of low frame rate and what we would now call crappy graphics because they were having</p>
<p>so much fun playing Doom or whatever.</p>
<p>Even Tetris.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So for sure that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And so I was working on consumer facing content, there was a great team in Wellington, New</p>
<p>Zealand that made a game called Dr. Groydbrod&rsquo;s Invaders that realized the potential of AR</p>
<p>gaming in a way that I don&rsquo;t think anything else has before or since.</p>
<p>And so that was definitely the strategy until, what, April 2020, which is when the company</p>
<p>decided to pivot to commercial industrial applications instead.</p>
<p>And I haven&rsquo;t seen their financial projections, but I assume they had good reasons for making</p>
<p>that strategic decision.</p>
<p>It just means that it&rsquo;s no longer necessarily targeted at just end users who want to play</p>
<p>a game or be entertained.</p>
<p>That to me from a dreamer, futurist perspective is heartbreaking because I don&rsquo;t know necessarily</p>
<p>from in the VR space, but I see this kind of thing with robotics where to me the future</p>
<p>of robotics is consumer facing and a lot of great roboticists, Boston Dynamics and companies</p>
<p>like that are focused on sort of industrial applications for financial business reasons.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now I can see the parallels for sure.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>It was a fun project.</p>
<p>We worked on an app, for example, called Baby Goats, which just populated your room with</p>
<p>baby goats.</p>
<p>That seemed like a killer app right there.</p>
<p>No, we thought highly of the idea for sure.</p>
<p>But because of the SLAM, the system knew, for example, here&rsquo;s a table, here&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>end table.</p>
<p>We know the heights.</p>
<p>We know how high our animated baby goat can jump.</p>
<p>So our engineers had to build a system for converting the SLAM primitives into game engine</p>
<p>objects that the AIs in the game could navigate around.</p>
<p>And that ended up shipping as more of a dev kit or a sort of how to a sample app than</p>
<p>as a finished consumer facing.</p>
<p>You mean the baby goat AI?</p>
<p>That seems to me like a world I could entertain myself for hours, just every day coming home</p>
<p>to see baby goats.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it was an ambient kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a thing that you would sit there and play like a video.</p>
<p>Just life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But now there&rsquo;s baby goats.</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s the purpose of having dogs and cats in your life exactly?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of ambient.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not really helping you do anything, but it&rsquo;s enriching your life.</p>
<p>You can go and play fetch or something for a while if you want, but you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>So we worked on that in a bigger project that was more of a storytelling in a fictional</p>
<p>universe.</p>
<p>The hardware is worth a look.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a belief, I just saw it this morning looking at Twitter, that the Magic</p>
<p>League never shipped anything.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ve been, since 2019, you can go to their website and buy one of these devices</p>
<p>anytime you want to spend the money.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the new one is coming out, I think in 2022, so in a few months.</p>
<p>What do you think, looking out 50 years from now, what wins?</p>
<p>Virtual reality, augmented reality, or physical reality?</p>
<p>What wins?</p>
<p>Meaning like, what do people that have financial resources enjoy spending most of their time</p>
<p>in?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of AR and it&rsquo;s kind of an easy answer because if you&rsquo;re wearing</p>
<p>an AR device and you put a bag over your head, it becomes a VR device.</p>
<p>If you block out what&rsquo;s really there, then all you&rsquo;re seeing is a VR.</p>
<p>But you are, with AR, constrained to kind of operate in something that&rsquo;s similar to</p>
<p>physical reality.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>With VR, you can go into fantastical worlds.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>But there are still issues in those fantastical worlds with motion sickness.</p>
<p>If your body is experiencing acceleration, your inner ear, that differs from what your</p>
<p>eye thinks it&rsquo;s seeing, then you&rsquo;ll get sick, unless you&rsquo;re a very unusual person.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t do it, it&rsquo;s just a constraint that VR designers have to learn</p>
<p>to work with.</p>
<p>So do you think it&rsquo;s possible that in the future, we&rsquo;re living mostly in a virtual reality</p>
<p>world?</p>
<p>Like, we become more and more detached from physical reality?</p>
<p>For entertainment, maybe, for certain applications, I&rsquo;m personally more, I mean, we have to make</p>
<p>a distinction between what I would personally find interesting and what might win in the</p>
<p>market.</p>
<p>So maybe some people, maybe lots of people, would like to spend a huge amount of time</p>
<p>in VR.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m personally more interested in enhancing the experience that I have of the physical</p>
<p>world, because the physical world&rsquo;s pretty cool, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to be said for moving around in the real world.</p>
<p>And I ask you for you personally, to try to play devil&rsquo;s advocate, or to try to construct,</p>
<p>to imagine a VR world where you and Neal Stephenson wouldn&rsquo;t want to stay.</p>
<p>Not because the physical world all of a sudden became really bad, for some reason, like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to escape it.</p>
<p>Like, literally, it&rsquo;s just more enriching.</p>
<p>In the same way, like, there&rsquo;s a glimmer in your eye when you said you enjoy the physical</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>Like, double up on that glimmer for the virtual reality.</p>
<p>Can you imagine such a world?</p>
<p>Well, like, I&rsquo;ll give maybe an example that&rsquo;s a bridge, which is that I like making things.</p>
<p>So I like working in a machine shop and making objects with 3D printers or machines or whatever.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve had to learn how to get good at using a CAD program.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many to choose from.</p>
<p>I use one called Fusion 360.</p>
<p>And I can spend hours in that trying to create, imagine and create the things I want to create.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not virtual reality exactly, but that whole time, my whole field of view is</p>
<p>occupied by this monitor that&rsquo;s showing me a window into a three dimensional space.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m rotating things around.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m imagining things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making things.</p>
<p>And so that is pretty close to being in virtual reality.</p>
<p>Does that thing have to exist for you to experience true joy?</p>
<p>Can you stay in Fusion 360 the whole time?</p>
<p>Do you have to 3D print it and touch it?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s my game.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m up to.</p>
<p>But it happens that if you&rsquo;re building a virtual environment, if you&rsquo;re making a game level</p>
<p>or creating a virtual set for a film or TV production, the thing that you&rsquo;re designing</p>
<p>in the program may never physically exist.</p>
<p>And in fact, it&rsquo;s preferable that it doesn&rsquo;t because the whole point of that is to make</p>
<p>imaginary things that you couldn&rsquo;t build otherwise.</p>
<p>So I think lots of people spend a good chunk of their working hours in something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty close to VR.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that currently the output device happens to be a rectangular object in front</p>
<p>of them.</p>
<p>You could replace that with a VR headset and they&rsquo;d be doing the same stuff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of interfaces.</p>
<p>For example, I enjoy listening to podcasts or audiobooks, but let&rsquo;s say actually podcasts</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s an intimate human connection in a podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one way.</p>
<p>But you get to learn about the person you&rsquo;re listening to and that&rsquo;s a real connection</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just audio.</p>
<p>For a lot of people, that&rsquo;s just audio.</p>
<p>And for me, that&rsquo;s just audio as a fan of people and you kind of a little bit are friends</p>
<p>with those people.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re in your life, you&rsquo;re listening to them, yeah.</p>
<p>And I mean, they&rsquo;re as far away from real as it gets.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not even a visual component.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just audio.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re as real, like if I was on a desert island, like my imagination, like this thing</p>
<p>works pretty good in terms of imagination.</p>
<p>It creates a very beautiful world with just audio.</p>
<p>Or even just reading books.</p>
<p>Exactly, reading books.</p>
<p>Even more so with reading books because there are certain mediums which stimulate the imagination</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>When you present less, the imagination works more and that can create really enriching</p>
<p>experiences.</p>
<p>To me, the question is, can you do some of the amazing things that make life amazing</p>
<p>in virtual worlds?</p>
<p>It seems to me the answer there is obviously yes.</p>
<p>Even if I, like you, am attached to a lot of stuff in the physical world, I think I</p>
<p>can very readily imagine coming up with some of the same magical experiences in the virtual</p>
<p>world where you make friends and you can fall in love, where the source of love in your</p>
<p>life is to a much greater degree inside of a virtual world.</p>
<p>And then love means fulfillment, that means happiness, that&rsquo;s the thing you look forward</p>
<p>to.</p>
<p>And not some kind of dopamine rush type of love, but like long lasting like friendship.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>The real deal.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The question is on what is there in the way of applications, the content, and can it feed</p>
<p>you those things?</p>
<p>Can it give you, like in my example of using the CAD program, it gives me the ability to</p>
<p>do something I enjoy, which is imagining things and making things in a particular way.</p>
<p>Can we psychoanalyze you for a second?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>What exactly do you enjoy?</p>
<p>Is there some component of you building the thing where you get to at least a little bit</p>
<p>share with others?</p>
<p>Like is there a human in the loop outside of you in that picture?</p>
<p>Will anyone ever see it?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a source of your enjoyment because I would argue that perhaps when like the turtles</p>
<p>all the way down, when you get to the bottom turtle, it has to do with other sharing with</p>
<p>other humans.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And if you can then put those humans inside the VR world, then you start to&hellip;</p>
<p>Then you can&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay, for example, you could do it in the physical world, the 3D printing, but you share</p>
<p>it in the virtual world and that&rsquo;s where the source of happiness is.</p>
<p>I think at least speaking for myself, I&rsquo;m always thinking in terms of an audience and</p>
<p>at some level I feel like I&rsquo;m doing this for someone or communicating to someone, even</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s not a specific someone in mind, it could just be an abstract theoretical someone.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like another app I spend a lot of time in is Mathematica.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Incredible app.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And when I do a Mathematica notebook, if I&rsquo;m trying to figure something out, I spend a</p>
<p>lot of time typing, just my stuff is just huge blocks of text, just me thinking out</p>
<p>loud and then some graphs and calculations and stuff.</p>
<p>Because to me, that act of explaining things and commenting helps me understand what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s kind of an audience, amorphous audience in mind.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, most of this stuff nobody will ever see and yet I&rsquo;m creating it as if there were</p>
<p>an audience that might read this stuff because that&rsquo;s a necessary constraint that helps me</p>
<p>do a better job.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the, this might be a tricky question to answer, what comes to mind as a particularly</p>
<p>beautiful thing that you&rsquo;re proud of that you created inside Mathematica visualization</p>
<p>wise or something that just comes to memory if it&rsquo;s possible to retrieve?</p>
<p>So the thing I&rsquo;ve spent the most amount of time on is I got obsessed a long time ago,</p>
<p>was trying to tile the globe with hexagons.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>An actual globe?</p>
<p>Well, any spherical.</p>
<p>Any spherical.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But with an eye towards putting it on the earth.</p>
<p>And so, and have it be recursive.</p>
<p>So you can have hexagons within hexagons, which is hard because and probably a bad idea</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t tile a hexagon with smaller hexagons.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t, they stick out.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re, oh, they stick out.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a, can you do some kind of fractal hexagon situation?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s that and people who know me are always, now make fun of me for this.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll send me, if they see a picture with hexagons in it, they&rsquo;ll like send me</p>
<p>a link to make fun of me.</p>
<p>So as some.</p>
<p>One of those people, Roger Penrose or.</p>
<p>I think Roger&rsquo;s a little above my level.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s into hexagons as well and tiling.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I did a lot of that and I thought, you know, it was pretty cool, but there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>like surprisingly intractable problems that keep coming up.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;ve always got to have some pentagons.</p>
<p>Like if you start with the icosahedron, which is equilateral triangles, which is a logical</p>
<p>place to start, you can cover those with hexagons, but every vertex where the triangles come</p>
<p>together is a pentagon.</p>
<p>Has to be a pentagon.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all hexagons and then there&rsquo;s a pentagon at the intersections.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;d you figure that out?</p>
<p>Is that a known fact?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s just, if you look at a.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like just by inspection.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an obvious thing.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So any system that you come up with to do this has got to have this exceptions built</p>
<p>into it for those 12.</p>
<p>You could have quintillions of hexagons, but you&rsquo;ve still got to have 12 pentagons somewhere.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve blown a hell of a lot of time on that over the years.</p>
<p>By the way, a lot of those kind of problems are very difficult to prove something about.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think Uber did it because someone, one of my friends who knows of my interest in this</p>
<p>and who likes to give me a hard time sent me a link.</p>
<p>This is a couple of years ago to some code base that I think came out of Uber where they</p>
<p>had done this.</p>
<p>You break down the whole surface of the earth into little hexagons.</p>
<p>So that was a real knife through the heart.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll probably come back to it someday.</p>
<p>Is there something special about hexagons or are you interested in all kinds of tiling?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m interested in all kinds of tiling, but I know my limitations as a math guy.</p>
<p>So hexagons are about my speed.</p>
<p>Just sufficient amount of complexity.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But no, tiling is a really interesting problem.</p>
<p>Both two and three dimensional tiling problems are fascinating and they&rsquo;re one of those ancient</p>
<p>puzzles that has attracted brainiacs for centuries.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a little bit about AI.</p>
<p>What are some likely interesting trajectories for the proliferation of AI in society over</p>
<p>the next couple of decades?</p>
<p>Do you think about this kind of stuff?</p>
<p>I do not think about it a lot because it&rsquo;s a deep topic and I don&rsquo;t consider myself super</p>
<p>well informed about it.</p>
<p>And AI seems to be a term that is applied to a lot of different things.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve messed around just a tiny little bit with neural nets, with what&rsquo;s it called PCA,</p>
<p>principal component analysis.</p>
<p>So I guess I tend to think in terms of some granular bottom up ideas rather than big picture</p>
<p>top down.</p>
<p>Oh God.</p>
<p>So like very specific algorithms, like how are they going to, what problem are they going</p>
<p>to solve in society such that it has like a lot of big ripple effects.</p>
<p>I mean, we could talk a particular successful AI systems and success defined in different</p>
<p>ways of recent years.</p>
<p>So one is language models with GPT3.</p>
<p>Most importantly, they&rsquo;re self supervised, meaning they don&rsquo;t require much supervision</p>
<p>from humans, which means they can learn by just reading a huge amount of content created</p>
<p>by humans.</p>
<p>So read the internet and from that be able to generate text and do all kinds of things</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible they have a big enough neural network.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be able to have conversations with humans based on just reading human language.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting idea.</p>
<p>To me, the very interesting idea that people don&rsquo;t think about it as AI because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>kind of dumb currently is actual embodied robots.</p>
<p>So robotics like Boston Dynamics have downstairs and upstairs legged robots.</p>
<p>You know, the currently Boston Dynamics robots and most legged robots, most robots period</p>
<p>are pretty dumb.</p>
<p>Most of the challenges have to do with the actual, first of all, the engineering of making</p>
<p>the thing work, getting a sensor suite that allows you to do the same thing as with Magic</p>
<p>Leap.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a layer of like, where am I and what am I looking at?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to deeply understand my surroundings at a level beyond of what will hurt if I run</p>
<p>into it.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But even that is hard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>But the thing that I think people don&rsquo;t in the robotics space explore enough is the human</p>
<p>robot interaction part of the picture, which is how it makes humans feel, how robots make</p>
<p>humans feel.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s going to have a very significant impact in the near future in society, which</p>
<p>is the more you integrate AI systems of whatever form into society where humans are in contact</p>
<p>with them regularly.</p>
<p>So that could be embodied robotics or that could be social media algorithms.</p>
<p>I think that has a very significant impact.</p>
<p>And people often think like AI needs to be super smart to have an impact.</p>
<p>I think it needs to be super integrated with society to have an impact and more and more</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening, even if they&rsquo;re dumb.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I mean, a lot of my exposure to robots is that I&rsquo;m associated with a combat robotics</p>
<p>team.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been to a few battle bots competitions.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not like a lot of ways that&rsquo;s pretty far from the kind of robotics you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about because these robots are remote controlled.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not autonomous.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re pretty simple, but it&rsquo;s interesting to watch people&rsquo;s emotional reactions to different</p>
<p>robots.</p>
<p>So there was one that was in the last year&rsquo;s season, the 2020 season called Rusty that</p>
<p>was just like put together out of spare parts and it looked kind of cute and it became this</p>
<p>huge crowd favorite because you could see it was made of like salad bowls and random</p>
<p>pieces of hardware that this guy had like scavenged from his farm.</p>
<p>And so immediately people kind of fell in love with this one particular robot.</p>
<p>Whereas other robots might be like the bad guy, if you think of professional wrestling,</p>
<p>the heel and the baby face.</p>
<p>So people do, for reasons that are hard to understand, form these emotional reactions.</p>
<p>And we form narratives in the same way we do when we meet human beings, we tell stories</p>
<p>about these objects and they can be intelligent and they can be biological or they can be</p>
<p>almost close to inanimate objects.</p>
<p>That to me is kind of fascinating.</p>
<p>And if robots choose to lean into that, it creates an interesting world.</p>
<p>If they start using feedback loops to make themselves cuter.</p>
<p>Not just cuter, but everything that humans do, let&rsquo;s not speak harshly of robots, humans</p>
<p>do the same thing.</p>
<p>Oh no, I wasn&rsquo;t meaning it in a, but you&rsquo;re right, humans based on feedback will change</p>
<p>their appearance.</p>
<p>Yes, I do this on Instagram all the time, how do I look cuter?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the fundamental question I ask myself.</p>
<p>So why wouldn&rsquo;t a robot wanna, it&rsquo;s like oh wow, people really don&rsquo;t like the quad mount</p>
<p>machine gun on top of my turret, maybe I should get rid of that and people would feel more</p>
<p>at ease.</p>
<p>Or lean into it, be proud of it.</p>
<p>Like you won&rsquo;t take my gun, whatever the saying is, from my dead cold hands.</p>
<p>I mean their personality, adding personality such that you can start to heal, you can start</p>
<p>to weave narratives.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a fascinating place where there&rsquo;s this feedback loop, like you said, where AI,</p>
<p>especially when it&rsquo;s embodied, puts a mirror to ourselves.</p>
<p>Just like other humans, our close friends, they kind of teach us about ourselves.</p>
<p>We teach each other and through that process grow close.</p>
<p>And to me it&rsquo;s so fascinating to expand the space of deep meaningful interactions beyond</p>
<p>just humans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the opportunity I see with robots and with AI systems and that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>my biggest problem with social media algorithms is the lack of transparency.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the existence of the algorithms, it&rsquo;s, well there&rsquo;s many things.</p>
<p>One is the data.</p>
<p>Data should be controlled by people themselves.</p>
<p>But also the lack of transparency in how the algorithms work.</p>
<p>You change your perception of what&rsquo;s real in hidden ways.</p>
<p>In hidden ways.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like you should be aware, just like when you take, I don&rsquo;t know, if you take psychedelics,</p>
<p>you should be aware that you took the psychedelics, it shouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise.</p>
<p>And second, you should become a student and a scholar and there should be research done,</p>
<p>there should be open conversation about how your perception has changed and then you become</p>
<p>your own guide in this world of altered perception because arguably none of it is real.</p>
<p>You get to choose the flavor of real.</p>
<p>I mean, this is something you explore quite a bit.</p>
<p>Do you yourself think that there is a bottom to it where there is reality, there&rsquo;s a base</p>
<p>layer of reality that physics can explore and our human perception sort of layer stuff?</p>
<p>Is there, let&rsquo;s go to Plato, is there such a thing as truth?</p>
<p>I lean towards the Platonic view of things.</p>
<p>So I believe that mathematical objects have a reality that it&rsquo;s not all made up by human</p>
<p>minds.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know where that reality comes from.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t explain it, but I do think that mathematical objects are discovered and not invented.</p>
<p>I did a lot of, not a lot, but I did some reading of Husserl when I was writing Anathem</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a 20th century phenomenologist and he&rsquo;s writing in the, he&rsquo;s writing at the same</p>
<p>time as scientists are starting to understand atoms and becoming aware that when we look</p>
<p>at this table, it&rsquo;s really just a slab of almost entirely vacuum and there&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>sparse arrangement of tiny, tiny little particles there occupying that space that interact with</p>
<p>each other in such a way that our brains perceive this object.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of the beginnings of phenomenology and his stuff is pretty hard to read.</p>
<p>You really have to take it in small bites and go a little bit at a time.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s trying to come to grips with these kinds of questions.</p>
<p>How did you come to grips with it?</p>
<p>Why does this table feel solid?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, we&rsquo;re an evolved system that there&rsquo;s, we have biological advantages in</p>
<p>knowing where solid objects are.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got this system in our head that integrates our perceptions into this coherent</p>
<p>view of things.</p>
<p>One of the take homes that I like from Husserl is the idea of intersubjectivity and the idea</p>
<p>that the fundamental requirement for us to stay sane is for us to share our perceptions</p>
<p>and have them ratified by other, they don&rsquo;t even have to be people, but a prisoner in</p>
<p>solitary confinement might domesticate a mouse or even insects because they perceive the</p>
<p>same things that the prisoner perceives and so convince him that he&rsquo;s not just hallucinating.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s the establish a consensus, but see, that doesn&rsquo;t mean any of it is real.</p>
<p>You just establish a consensus.</p>
<p>It could be very distant from something that&rsquo;s real in an engineering sense of real.</p>
<p>Like you could build it using physics.</p>
<p>But I think that a valuable application for an AI robot would be just to do nothing except</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>It just sits there and if you hear a door slam, you might turn to see what it is.</p>
<p>If the robot at the same time turns to look at the door slam, it&rsquo;s ratifying your perception.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that the basis of love is when the door slams, you both look, but for deeper</p>
<p>things, you both hear the same music and others don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, isn&rsquo;t that what that means?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>By love, I mean depth of human connection.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, you arrive at similar reactions without having to explicitly communicate it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But we could start with a robot that listens explicitly for the slam doors or scary sounds.</p>
<p>I can think of an example of this is when I went to college, we&rsquo;d be sitting at the</p>
<p>cafeteria, a bunch of people eating our dinner together that we had just met, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>So a bunch of new people in your life and someone might make a funny remark or a not</p>
<p>so funny remark or something would happen and you might then at that moment make eye</p>
<p>contact with someone you didn&rsquo;t know at the other end of the table.</p>
<p>In that moment, you would realize this person is reacting.</p>
<p>This person heard what I heard.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re reacting the way I reacted.</p>
<p>Nobody else appears to get the joke or to understand what just happened, but random</p>
<p>stranger down there and I, we have this connection and then you build on that.</p>
<p>So then the next time something happens, you automatically look at your new friend and</p>
<p>they look back at you and before you know it, you&rsquo;re hanging out together because you</p>
<p>know you&rsquo;ve already established without even talking to each other that you&rsquo;re on the same</p>
<p>wavelength.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s seemingly so simple, but so powerful that establishing that you&rsquo;re on the same</p>
<p>wavelength at some level.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason why you and a toaster can&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying.</p>
<p>Does this smell burned to you?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s burnt.</p>
<p>If a toaster could just say that to you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Cryptonomicon published in 1999, set in the late 90s and involves hackers who build essentially</p>
<p>cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Bitcoin white paper came out in 2008.</p>
<p>So I have to kind of ask, from you looking at this layout of what&rsquo;s been happening in</p>
<p>cryptocurrency, the evolution of this technology, how has it rolled out differently than you</p>
<p>could have imagined in two ways?</p>
<p>One the technology itself and two the human side of things, the human stories of the hackers</p>
<p>and the financial folks and the powerful and the powerless, the human side of things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, Cryptonomicon is pre Bitcoin, it&rsquo;s pre Satoshi, it&rsquo;s pre blockchain as you point</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>So at that point I was kind of reacting to what I was seeing among people like the Bay</p>
<p>Area Cypherpunks in Berkeley.</p>
<p>There was a branch here in Austin as well and a lot of their thinking was based on the</p>
<p>idea that you would have to have a physical region of the earth that was free of government</p>
<p>interference.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t achieve that freedom by purely mathematical means on the network.</p>
<p>You actually had to have a room somewhere with servers in it that a government couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>come and meddle with.</p>
<p>And so a lot of ideation happened around that view of things that there were efforts to</p>
<p>figure out jurisdictions where this might work.</p>
<p>There was a lot of interest for a while in Anguilla, which is a Caribbean island that</p>
<p>had some unusual jurisdictional properties.</p>
<p>There was SeaLand, which is a platform in the North Sea.</p>
<p>And so there was a lot of effort that went into finding these physical locations that</p>
<p>were deemed kind of safe.</p>
<p>And that all goes away with blockchain, it&rsquo;s no longer necessary.</p>
<p>And so that really changes the picture in a lot of ways because you no longer have&hellip;</p>
<p>From a novelist point of view, the old system was a lot more fun to work with because it</p>
<p>gives you a situation where hackers are wandering around in strange parts of the world trying</p>
<p>to set up server rooms.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a great storytelling thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a little bit of that in the modern world, but it&rsquo;s just there&rsquo;s several</p>
<p>server rooms as opposed to one centralized one.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Whereas the new wrinkle is the need to do a lot of computation and to keep your GPUs</p>
<p>from melting down.</p>
<p>So people building things in Iceland or in shipping containers on the bottom of the ocean</p>
<p>or whatever.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s still governments involved and there&rsquo;s still from a novelist perspective</p>
<p>interesting dynamics with big governments like China and more sort of renegade governments</p>
<p>from all over the world trying to contend with this idea of what to do in terms of control</p>
<p>and power over these kinds of centers that do the mining of the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re in a stage now that kind of goes beyond the initial&hellip;</p>
<p>Like there was&hellip;</p>
<p>The stuff I was describing in Cryptonomicon had a little bit of air about it of the underpants</p>
<p>gnomes in that we&rsquo;re gonna build this system and then we&rsquo;ll make money somehow.</p>
<p>But the intermediate step was left out.</p>
<p>And that is&hellip;</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re now sort of into that phase of the thing where Bitcoin, blockchain exists,</p>
<p>people know how it works, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies exist.</p>
<p>People are using them and it&rsquo;s sort of like, okay, what now?</p>
<p>Where does this all lead?</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>Do you have a sense of where it all leads?</p>
<p>Like is it possible that the set of technology kind of continues to have transformational</p>
<p>effects on not just sort of finance but who gets to have power in this world?</p>
<p>So the decentralization of power.</p>
<p>Big questions, right?</p>
<p>So I guess there&rsquo;s a little bit of the cynic in me thinking that as soon as it becomes</p>
<p>important enough, the existing banks and people in power are gonna sort of control it.</p>
<p>I guess an easy answer is that maybe it won&rsquo;t be a big change in the end.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a utopian strain sometimes in the way people think about this that I&rsquo;m not so</p>
<p>sure about.</p>
<p>There is a technological aspect to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that make it a</p>
<p>little easier to pull along the utopian thread because it&rsquo;s harder for governments to control</p>
<p>Bitcoin.</p>
<p>I mean, they have much fewer options.</p>
<p>They can ban, they can make it illegal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more difficult.</p>
<p>So technology here is on the side of the powerless, the voiceless, which is a very interesting</p>
<p>idea.</p>
<p>Of course, yes, it does have a utopian feel to it, but we have been making progress throughout</p>
<p>human history.</p>
<p>Maybe this is what progress looks like.</p>
<p>There will be the powerful and the greedy and the bureaucrats that take advantage of</p>
<p>it, skim off the top kind of thing, but maybe this does give more power to people that haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>had power before in a good way, like distributing power and enabling sort of more greater resistance</p>
<p>to sort of dictatorships and authoritarian regimes, that kind of thing, and also enabling</p>
<p>all kinds of technologies built on top of it.</p>
<p>Ultimately, when you digitize money, money is a kind of speech, or it&rsquo;s a kind of mechanism</p>
<p>of how humans interact, and if you make that digital, more and more of the world moves</p>
<p>to the digital space, and then you can finally fully live in that virtual reality with the</p>
<p>toaster.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways, I think in that realm of technology that the money per se is one of</p>
<p>the less interesting things you can do with it, so I think cryptographically enforceable</p>
<p>contracts and organizations built on those, that seems to me like it&rsquo;s got more potential</p>
<p>for change just because we do already have money, and although it&rsquo;s an old system, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been digitized to a large extent by the stripes and the credit card companies of the world.</p>
<p>I also love the idea of connecting two smart contracts, connecting data, sort of making</p>
<p>it more formal, it&rsquo;s like Mathematica, more structured, the integration of data, of weather</p>
<p>data, of all kinds of data about the stuff in the world, so they can make contracts between</p>
<p>people that&rsquo;s grounded in data, and that&rsquo;s actually getting closer to something like</p>
<p>truth, because then you can make agreements based on actual data versus kind of perceptions</p>
<p>of data, and if you can formalize, like distribute the power of who gets to tell the story, and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an interesting kind of resistance against the powerful in the space of narrative.</p>
<p>Yeah, David Brin has been saying for a while that the only way to settle arguments across</p>
<p>the political divide is to make bets, so people can say the election was stolen, or whatever</p>
<p>controversial position they&rsquo;re taking, and they&rsquo;ll keep saying it until you wager real</p>
<p>money on it.</p>
<p>So maybe there&rsquo;s something there, if you could kind of turn that into a, put a user interface</p>
<p>on that.</p>
<p>Yeah, have a stake in your divisiveness, in your arguments.</p>
<p>Will Dogecoin take over the world?</p>
<p>Twitter question.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t follow the different coins that much, so I don&rsquo;t, I mean I hear about</p>
<p>Dogecoin and I&rsquo;ve kind of followed the story of it.</p>
<p>So the interesting aspect of Dogecoin is it, so in contrast to like Bitcoin and Ethereum,</p>
<p>which are these serious implementations of cryptocurrency that seek to solve some of</p>
<p>the problems that we&rsquo;re talking about with smart contracts and resist the banks and all</p>
<p>those kinds of things, Dogecoin operates more in the space of memes and humor, while still</p>
<p>doing some of the similar things.</p>
<p>And it presents to the world sort of a question of whether memes, whether humor, whether narrative</p>
<p>will go a long way in the future.</p>
<p>Like much farther than some kind of boring old grounded technologies.</p>
<p>Whether we&rsquo;ll be playing in the space of fun.</p>
<p>Like once we&rsquo;ve built a base of comfort and stability and like a robust system where everyone</p>
<p>has shelter, everyone has food and the basic needs covered, are we going to then operate</p>
<p>in the space of fun?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I think about Dogecoin.</p>
<p>Because it seems like fun spreads faster than anything else.</p>
<p>Fun of different kinds, and that could be bad fun and that could be good fun.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a battle of good fun versus bad fun.</p>
<p>It goes viral very, very quickly when you, if you post something that people find fun</p>
<p>to.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what Dogecoin represents.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like, so Bitcoin represents like financial, like serious financial instruments</p>
<p>and then Dogecoin represents fun.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting to watch the battle go on on the internet to see which wins.</p>
<p>This is also like open question to me of what is the internet?</p>
<p>Because fun seems to prevail on the internet.</p>
<p>And is that a fundamental property of the internet moving forward when you look a hundred</p>
<p>years out, or is this a temporary thing that was true at the birth of the internet and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just true for a couple of decades until it fades away and the adults take over and</p>
<p>become serious again?</p>
<p>Well, I think the adults took over initially and then it was later on that people started</p>
<p>using it for fun, frivolous things like memes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I think that&rsquo;s pretty much unstoppable, you know, because even people who are very</p>
<p>serious, you know, enjoy sending around a funny picture or something that amuses them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I personally think we spoke about World War II.</p>
<p>I think memes will save the world and prevent all future wars.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been handwriting your work for the past 20 years since writing The Baroque Cycle.</p>
<p>What are the pros and cons of handwriting versus typing?</p>
<p>For me, I started it as an experiment when I started The Baroque Cycle because I had</p>
<p>noticed that sometimes if I was stuck having a hard time getting started, if I just picked</p>
<p>up a pen and started writing, it was easy to go.</p>
<p>So I just decided to keep with that.</p>
<p>If it got in my way, I didn&rsquo;t like it, I could always just go back to the word processor</p>
<p>and be fine.</p>
<p>But that never happened.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a certain security that comes from knowing that it&rsquo;s ink on paper and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no operating system crash or software failure that can obliterate it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a slower output technique.</p>
<p>And so a sentence or a paragraph spends a longer time in the buffer up here before it</p>
<p>gets committed to paper, whereas I can type really fast.</p>
<p>And so I can slam things out before I&rsquo;ve really thought them through.</p>
<p>So I think the first draft quality ends up being higher.</p>
<p>And then editing, first draft of editing is just faster because instead of like trying</p>
<p>to move the cursor around or whatever or hitting the backspace key, I can just draw a line</p>
<p>through a word or a sentence or just around a whole paragraph and exit out.</p>
<p>And in doing so, I very quickly created an edit, but I&rsquo;ve also left behind a record of</p>
<p>what the text was prior to the edit.</p>
<p>Of course, all the digital versions have those quote unquote features, but their experience</p>
<p>is different.</p>
<p>Is there a romance to just the physical, the touch of the pen to the paper doing what has</p>
<p>been done for centuries?</p>
<p>I think there is.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s just the simplicity of it and not having any intermediary technology</p>
<p>beyond the pen and the paper is just very simple and clean and so I&rsquo;ve got a bunch of</p>
<p>fountain pens.</p>
<p>I started buying fancy paper from Italy a few years ago because I thought I would be</p>
<p>more conservative with it, but it&rsquo;s still a trivial expenditure, so it doesn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>alter my habits very much.</p>
<p>So all that said, once you do type stuff up, you use Emacs.</p>
<p>I use Emacs, obviously the superior editor.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Let me just ask the ridiculous futuristic question because Emacs has been around forever.</p>
<p>Do you think in 100 years we will still have Emacs and Vim, or like pick a let&rsquo;s say 50,</p>
<p>100 years.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>No, I mean whenever you&rsquo;re doing anything in Linux, you&rsquo;re spending a lot of time editing</p>
<p>little config files and scripts and stuff and you need to be able to pop in and out</p>
<p>of editing those things and it needs to work.</p>
<p>Like even if the windowing GUI is dead and all you&rsquo;ve got is like a command line, to</p>
<p>get out of that problem, you might need to enter an editor and alter a file.</p>
<p>So I think on that level, there will always have to be sort of very simple, well Emacs</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t very simple, but you know what I mean.</p>
<p>There have to be basic editors that you can use from either the command line or a GUI</p>
<p>just for administering systems.</p>
<p>Now how widespread they&rsquo;ll be, there&rsquo;s a certain amount of, what&rsquo;s the story of the American</p>
<p>folktale of the hammer guy who drives the railroad spikes, John Henry, trying to keep</p>
<p>up with the steam hammer and eventually the steam hammer wins because he can&rsquo;t drive the</p>
<p>spikes fast enough.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a sense in which Microsoft, who knows how much they&rsquo;ve invested in code visual</p>
<p>studio or Apple with Xcode.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve put huge amounts of money into enhancing their IDEs and Emacs in theory can</p>
<p>duplicate all of those features by if you just have enough Linux hackers writing Emacs</p>
<p>Lisp macros, but at some point it&rsquo;s gonna be hard to maintain that level of, to keep</p>
<p>up feature for feature.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about Emacs just is it&rsquo;s lasted a long time and I think you talked</p>
<p>about that there&rsquo;s a certain fads certainly in the software engineering space and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting to think about technologies that sort of last for a very long time and just</p>
<p>kind of being in the, what is it, how do they get by?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the cockroaches of software or the bacteria software or something like this base</p>
<p>thing that nobody, everybody&rsquo;s just became reliant on and they just outlast everything</p>
<p>else and slowly, slowly adjust with the times with a little bit of a delay, with a little</p>
<p>bit of customization by individuals kind of that, but they&rsquo;re always there in the shadows</p>
<p>and they outlast everybody else.</p>
<p>And I wonder if that might be the story for a lot of technologies, especially in the software</p>
<p>space.</p>
<p>Shell scripts, all that stuff, you can&rsquo;t run the modern world without a bunch of shell</p>
<p>scripts booting up machines and running things.</p>
<p>So that is gonna be a hard thing to replace.</p>
<p>And then tech for typesetting that you use, you said.</p>
<p>For when I want to print it out, yeah, I just have some simple macros that I use, but then</p>
<p>I have to, the publisher put their foot down and they want it in Word format now.</p>
<p>So years ago I wrote some macros to convert and this time, what did I do?</p>
<p>Copy paste?</p>
<p>No, I use sort of regular expressions.</p>
<p>So I was to do italics in, you put it in curly brackets and you do backslash IT and then</p>
<p>you type what you want to type and that&rsquo;s how you get italics in tech.</p>
<p>So you can create a regular expression that&rsquo;ll look for some text between curly brackets</p>
<p>preceded by backslash IT and then instead convert that to italics.</p>
<p>And Word will do that.</p>
<p>Word if you go deep enough into its search and replace UI.</p>
<p>You can do regular expressions.</p>
<p>Is just regfs.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny that you did that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s tools that help you with that kind of thing, but the task is sufficiently</p>
<p>simple to where you can do a much better job than anyone, anybody else&rsquo;s tool can.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fascinating process.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine for me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it keeps you from messing around with formatting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, Oh, what if I put this chapter heading, you know, in, you know, a sans serif font?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s just classic wanking.</p>
<p>And so those options are closed off in what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>Is there advice you could say, what does it take to write a great story?</p>
<p>The power of, of good yarns, good narratives to, um, pull people in is, is, uh, incredible.</p>
<p>And I think my sort of amateur theory is that it&rsquo;s an evolutionary development that if you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>um, you know, uh, uh, cave person sitting around a fire in the rift valley a million</p>
<p>years ago, um, if you can tell the story of how you escaped from the hyenas, um, or how</p>
<p>uncle Bob, you know, didn&rsquo;t escape from the hyenas, and if the people listening to you</p>
<p>can take that in and they can build that scenario in their heads, like a kind of virtual reality</p>
<p>and see what you&rsquo;re describing, then you&rsquo;ve just conferred an incredibly important advantage</p>
<p>on the people who&rsquo;ve heard that story.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so they know a bunch of stuff now about how to stay alive that they could not have</p>
<p>learned in any other way.</p>
<p>Um, I mean, animals who don&rsquo;t have speech though, they might warn each other, they might</p>
<p>make a sound that says danger, danger, um, but, uh, but as far as we know, they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>tell more complicated stories.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a part of us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I, the, the, the collective intelligence seems to be one of the key characteristics of the,</p>
<p>of homo sapiens, the ability to share ideas and hold ideas together in our minds and storytelling</p>
<p>is the fundamental aspect of that.</p>
<p>Maybe even language itself is more fundamental because the language is required to do the</p>
<p>storytelling or maybe they evolve together.</p>
<p>Maybe they co evolve.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I think that you&rsquo;ve got to work with that and I think, uh, sometimes it seems like in</p>
<p>kind of, um, literary circles that having a lot of plot is a little bit frowned upon</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s pulpy or it&rsquo;s exploitative, but, um, for me, I don&rsquo;t have any compunctions whatsoever</p>
<p>about that.</p>
<p>I like stories that, um, are grabby and fun and exciting to read.</p>
<p>And once you&rsquo;ve got one of those going, once you&rsquo;ve got a good yarn going that people will</p>
<p>enjoy reading, then you&rsquo;re free to do whatever you want, uh, in the frame of that story.</p>
<p>Um, but if you don&rsquo;t have that, um, then you got nothing.</p>
<p>What about having like, uh, which you do at a technological scientific rigor, like to</p>
<p>the, to the accuracy and as much as possible, how does that add to the, to, to Bob telling</p>
<p>the story or telling the story about Bob or on the campfire?</p>
<p>Well, the main thing that it does is, um, present, um, little details that you might</p>
<p>not have come up with on your own.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re just sitting there freely imagining things, um, you, uh, you, your, your brain</p>
<p>probably isn&rsquo;t going to serve up the wealth of details and the resulting complications</p>
<p>and surprises that real, that the real world is constantly presenting us with.</p>
<p>And so, um, in my case, if I&rsquo;m, um, trying to write a story about, you know, some that</p>
<p>involves some technology like a rocket or, uh, orbital maneuvers or whatever, then delving</p>
<p>into those details eventually is going to turn up some weird unexpected, you know, thing</p>
<p>that, uh, gives me material to work with, but also subliminally readers who see that</p>
<p>are going to be drawn in more, uh, because they&rsquo;re going to, uh, to, to find that, um,</p>
<p>oh, I didn&rsquo;t see that coming, you know, you know, it&rsquo;s got some of the complexity and</p>
<p>surprise value of the real world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It does something, um, uh, Alex Garland, director who did, uh, who wrote, uh, directed Ex Machina.</p>
<p>I think about AI movies and the more care you take in making it accurate, the more compelling</p>
<p>the story becomes somehow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m not sure what that is.</p>
<p>Um, maybe because it becomes more real to the people writing the story, maybe it just</p>
<p>makes you a better writer.</p>
<p>The key to any storytelling is getting the, the readers to suspend their, their disbelief.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all kinds of triggers and little tells that can break that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Um, and once it&rsquo;s broken, it&rsquo;s really hard to get it back.</p>
<p>Uh, you know, a lot of times that&rsquo;s the end.</p>
<p>Everybody will just close the book and not pick it up.</p>
<p>Um, I gotta ask you, you&rsquo;ve answered this question, but I gotta ask you the most impossible</p>
<p>question for an author to answer, but which Neal Stephenson book should one read first?</p>
<p>So when people ask me that, I usually ask them what they like to read, right?</p>
<p>Because, uh, I mean, there&rsquo;s the best known one is probably snow crash, but that&rsquo;s a cyber</p>
<p>punk novel.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s at the same time, making fun of cyber punk.</p>
<p>Um, so it&rsquo;s kind of got some layers to it that, uh, might not seem so funny if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have that, if you don&rsquo;t get the joke, right?</p>
<p>So, um, there&rsquo;s, uh, I&rsquo;ve written, as you point out, I&rsquo;ve written historical novels.</p>
<p>Some people like those.</p>
<p>Some people prefer those.</p>
<p>So if that&rsquo;s what you like, then kryptonomicon or the baroque cycle is where you would start</p>
<p>if you like sort of techno thrillers that are set in a modern day setting, but aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>science fictiony per se, then, uh, Reamdy, um, is one of those.</p>
<p>And termination shock, um, is, is, is definitely one of those.</p>
<p>Um, so it just depends on, on, uh, what people like.</p>
<p>What, what, uh, when people a long time ago recommend I read snow crash, they said, uh,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the, it&rsquo;s Neil Stevenson light.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, uh, like if you don&rsquo;t want to be overwhelmed by the depth, like the rigor book,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s a good, that&rsquo;s a good introduction to the man.</p>
<p>So essentially you broke it down by topics, but if you wanted to read all of them, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a good introduction to the, to the man, because obviously these worlds are very different.</p>
<p>The philosophies are very different.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a good introduction to the human?</p>
<p>People ask the same thing of Dostoyevsky, people, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a hard one to answer.</p>
<p>Maybe seven eves because it&rsquo;s got big themes.</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s about heavy, heavy things happening to the human race.</p>
<p>Uh, but hopefully the story is told through a cast of characters that, uh, people can</p>
<p>relate to, you know, and it moves along, uh, so, uh, it, it does go kind of deep eventually</p>
<p>on how rockets work and orbital mechanics and all that stuff, but, um, people were able</p>
<p>to get through it anyway, or some people just skip over that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>You know, um, as an author, let me ask you what books had a big impact on your life that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve read.</p>
<p>Is there any that jumped to mind that, uh, you learned from as a writer, as a philosopher,</p>
<p>as a mathematician, as an engineer?</p>
<p>This is one of these questions where I always blank out.</p>
<p>And then when I&rsquo;m walking out the door, I&rsquo;ll, I&rsquo;ll remember 12, so this is a random selection</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t represent the top.</p>
<p>The top ones, um, well, I mentioned, you know, gulag archipelago and it&rsquo;s kind of a hefty</p>
<p>and dark, but, and then it has a personal connection as well.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just like where you found the book to the part, the time in your life, where you found</p>
<p>it, who recommended it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also part of the story.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s definitely that there&rsquo;s, you know, I, I circle back to Moby Dick a lot, um, because</p>
<p>we read it in a, uh, a really great English class I had in high school.</p>
<p>And I came in with an oppositional stance because I thought that the teacher was going</p>
<p>to try to talk me into having all kinds of highfalutin ideas about allegory and what</p>
<p>does this mean?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the symbolism?</p>
<p>And it turned out that, uh, it turned out to be a lot more interesting and satisfying</p>
<p>than that.</p>
<p>Um, what was the first powerful book you remember reading that like convinced you that this</p>
<p>form could have depth?</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Was it Moby Dick?</p>
<p>Was it like in high school?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to remember, well, Moby Dick was definitely a big one.</p>
<p>Um, I mean, I used to read a lot of classics comics when I was, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen these, it&rsquo;s a whole series of comic books that, um, uh, it was viral.</p>
<p>You could, uh, in the, in the back of each comic book was an order form.</p>
<p>You could check some boxes and fill out your address and mail it in and more would show</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>And, but it was like, they would do the Count of Monte Cristo, you know, Moby Dick, you</p>
<p>know, Robert Louis Stevenson, Robinson Crusoe, you know, all this of classic books, uh, were,</p>
<p>they had put into comic book form.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Reading Moby Dick, if you&rsquo;re nine years old is a tall order.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some very complicated sentences in there and a lot of digressions, but if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just looking at the comic books, like, holy shit, look at that whale, you know?</p>
<p>Um, and, um, and ultimately the power of the story doesn&rsquo;t need the complicated words.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s all about the man and the, and the whale.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you could get kind of a grounding in a lot of classic works of literature without</p>
<p>actually reading them, which is, you know, it&rsquo;s great when you&rsquo;re nine years old.</p>
<p>So, so I read a lot of that stuff, uh, for sure.</p>
<p>The annotated Sherlock Holmes, um.</p>
<p>You mentioned David Deutsch too, as an inspiration for some of your work.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve, you&rsquo;ve obviously didn&rsquo;t like really a lot of research for the books you,</p>
<p>you do.</p>
<p>Roger Penrose.</p>
<p>What, uh, do you remember a book that made you want to become a writer or a moment that</p>
<p>made you become a writer?</p>
<p>I think like the, you know, the answer I usually give is that when I was in like fifth grade</p>
<p>and one of my friends came to school one day, he was wearing leather shoes, like dress shoes</p>
<p>and I hated dress shoes cause mine never fit.</p>
<p>And so they were uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t run, you know, they were cold, it was Iowa.</p>
<p>So I kind of said, I remember very clearly thinking, okay, I don&rsquo;t like where this is</p>
<p>going.</p>
<p>Like, does this mean that next year all of the kids are going to be wearing leather shoes?</p>
<p>So I need to find a job where I don&rsquo;t have to do that.</p>
<p>So that was like the first time I thought about trying to find such a job, you know,</p>
<p>being a writer.</p>
<p>And then, and then I just read a lot of, uh, just classic science fiction short stories</p>
<p>and started trying to write some of my own.</p>
<p>And there were just classic young adult stories like by Heinlein and the other classic names</p>
<p>that you think of.</p>
<p>But the Heinlein ones stuck, have stuck with me in a way that the others didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the greatest science fiction book ever written, just removing your work from consideration?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m loving torturing you right now.</p>
<p>Greatest ever non Stevenson.</p>
<p>Do we include fantasy or does it have to be science fiction?</p>
<p>Oh, interesting fantasy.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>I did not expect that twist.</p>
<p>Uh, well, for in a weird way, they&rsquo;re lumped together in people&rsquo;s minds, right?</p>
<p>So they are, but there, but there&rsquo;s also a boundary somehow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what that is exactly.</p>
<p>Nobody is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mystery.</p>
<p>So, I mean, if we do include it, then it&rsquo;s easily the, the Lord of the rings.</p>
<p>But, um, I mean, greatness is a interesting quality to, uh, to try to define.</p>
<p>Um, and for me, a lot of the, the fun and the joy of such books is, is not in what you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>call greatness, but just storytelling.</p>
<p>So I was always a big fan of has have space suit will travel, which is a Heinlein young</p>
<p>adult book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, uh, it&rsquo;s just a fun, good read.</p>
<p>Um, so, so fun is a big component.</p>
<p>Greatness is overrated.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s overrated, but it&rsquo;s just, you know, it&rsquo;s, it might be underdefined</p>
<p>to put it that way.</p>
<p>So how space it will travel now, I definitely have to read that one.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You mentioned Iowa.</p>
<p>It was, uh, there a couple of times I got to spend, uh, quite a bit of time with Dan</p>
<p>Gabel with Tom Brands who are wrestlers was, uh, is it now wrestling, martial arts, part</p>
<p>of your life, any part of your form formation of who you are as a human being?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>In a, it was a late, it was a late thing for me, but growing up in Ames, um, Dan Gabel</p>
<p>was, uh, a few years older than me.</p>
<p>And so sometimes we would go to the arena at the university and watch wrestling meets</p>
<p>and um, and this was before his Olympic career.</p>
<p>So everyone knew he was the star of that team and that he was the best, but people didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>yet know he was the greatest of all time.</p>
<p>You saw Gabe.</p>
<p>So that was part, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s funny is, uh, it feels like a small world that you would</p>
<p>be in the same space as Dan Gabel a hundred feet away, a little dot on the mat trouncing</p>
<p>his opponents, him and him and Chris Taylor.</p>
<p>So the other star was this 400 pound plus guy named Chris Taylor who, uh, also went</p>
<p>to the Olympics.</p>
<p>So yeah, people, you know, he was, he was a no, he was a, uh, athletic hero and wrestling</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s certain States like Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Iowa, where wrestling is the sport because</p>
<p>those are States of small towns.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re a small town is if you&rsquo;re like Dan Gabel, uh, and you have to be on</p>
<p>a football team with 20 other guys who are not Dan Gabel, then no matter how good you</p>
<p>are, your team might, might suck.</p>
<p>Uh, but if in a solo thing, you can, you can go to the Olympics.</p>
<p>So we did a lot of wrestling in our gym classes in school and I didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>And I think partly it&rsquo;s just that it was so, so competitive and the people who were cared</p>
<p>about it really cared about it a lot, you know?</p>
<p>And so it was, it was pretty tough and I didn&rsquo;t think I had the right body type.</p>
<p>But then when I was, uh, after college, I was in Iowa city for a few years when he was</p>
<p>coaching the, that the wrestling team there and the, he won like nine championships out</p>
<p>of 10 years, you know, during that, during that time.</p>
<p>So he was both the greatest individual wrestler of all time and like the greatest team coach.</p>
<p>Um, so I know I&rsquo;ve never met him, but we&rsquo;ve, uh, he&rsquo;s kind of been like in my sphere of</p>
<p>awareness since I was, you know, kind of my whole life.</p>
<p>And people would always tell stories about him, like I think he got arrested once for</p>
<p>some kind of, I don&rsquo;t know, minor offense in Ames.</p>
<p>And so he just basically stayed up all night.</p>
<p>He was in this cage in the jail, just stayed up all night doing pull ups on, you know,</p>
<p>it sounds about right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, uh, uh, so yeah.</p>
<p>So has that been, I mean, I was such an interesting place in the world and wrestling is just part</p>
<p>of that story.</p>
<p>Is that somewhere in there?</p>
<p>Does that resonate deeply with who you are?</p>
<p>It was a formative thing for me growing up there for sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a, uh, you know, uh, uh, or at least used to be a very orderly place, high social</p>
<p>capital, very minimal class differences.</p>
<p>So like you&rsquo;d have some people who would drive a Cadillac instead of a Chevy, but, uh, that</p>
<p>was it.</p>
<p>That was, you know, those were the rich people, right?</p>
<p>So, um, and a college town is always a different environment like, uh, you know, Austin, uh,</p>
<p>has some of this, um, so it was a pretty kind of utopian, uh, other than the weather and</p>
<p>a few other things, uh, environment to, to grow up in the, the martial art I ended up</p>
<p>doing is sword stuff, which is interesting because it uses a different feedback loop.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re, if you&rsquo;re grappling, everything is through sense of touch and your sense of</p>
<p>touch is very old and simple, right?</p>
<p>Like earthworms don&rsquo;t have, don&rsquo;t even have eyes, but they can tell when they&rsquo;re being</p>
<p>touched, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very fast.</p>
<p>Um, and uh, with, um, with a standoff or like boxing or some kinds of sword fighting, you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not touching the other person.</p>
<p>Most of the time, your, your, your visual system is doing something way more, it&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>slam and trying to figure out what the other person is up to.</p>
<p>And so, um, that always felt more my speed.</p>
<p>So in an Olympic style fencing, you&rsquo;re, it doesn&rsquo;t start really until you&rsquo;re crossing</p>
<p>blades with the other person and now you&rsquo;re back to wrestling, you&rsquo;re feeling what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing and it&rsquo;s all about that.</p>
<p>But some of the older sword arts, um, don&rsquo;t engage the blade that way.</p>
<p>You stand off at range and then you make cutting attacks and, um, and, uh, and so, so those</p>
<p>are all processed visually and I think I&rsquo;m more of a slow thinker, so it works for me</p>
<p>better.</p>
<p>I mean, the same, it has the same, the artistry and the beauty of boxing, I suppose, just</p>
<p>like you said, is like, there&rsquo;s no, there&rsquo;s no contact and it&rsquo;s all processed visually</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a dance of its own that, that depends on the characteristic of a sword</p>
<p>involved.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There is a set of, of stances and, and, uh, basic reactions that you try to learn that</p>
<p>are thought to be defensible, um, and, and safe or safer.</p>
<p>And so it tends to be a series of short engagements where you&rsquo;ll, you&rsquo;ll close in, you&rsquo;ll try</p>
<p>out your, your idea and it works or it doesn&rsquo;t, then you, you back off again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to think about like human history because martial arts, okay, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a thing.</p>
<p>But in terms of sword fighting, just the full range of humans that existed who mastered</p>
<p>sword fighting or sought the mastery of sword fighting, just to imagine the thousands of</p>
<p>people who, the heights they have achieved because the stakes are so incredibly high</p>
<p>to be good.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the richest, most powerful people in those societies spending whatever it takes</p>
<p>to get the best gear and the best training because you&rsquo;re right, everything depends on</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still life and death.</p>
<p>I mean, that, that&rsquo;s fascinating, um, that, that&rsquo;s fascinating and we perhaps have lost</p>
<p>that forever with greater weapons.</p>
<p>I mean, the artistry of sword fighting when it&rsquo;s life and death and you go into war, you</p>
<p>have the Miyamoto Musashi&rsquo;s of the world, right?</p>
<p>The, I don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a poetry to that, that there&rsquo;s a mastery to that that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we could achieve with any other kind of martial art.</p>
<p>Well the, one of the good, you were talking earlier about the, the, the good effects of</p>
<p>the internet, social media that we sometimes overlook.</p>
<p>And, and one of those is that, um, there were all these isolated people around the world</p>
<p>who were interested in this, who found each other and kind of created a network of, of</p>
<p>people who help each other learn these things.</p>
<p>So that doesn&rsquo;t mean that anyone is, is up to the level of the you&rsquo;re talking about yet,</p>
<p>but um, but it is happening and um, and so, um, there&rsquo;s a, a, a large number of old treatises,</p>
<p>old written documents, uh, that have been dug up from libraries and, and people have</p>
<p>been going over these and translating them from old dialects of Italian and German, um,</p>
<p>to make sense of them and, and learning how to do these techniques with different, uh,</p>
<p>different weapons.</p>
<p>Um, actually there&rsquo;s a guy here in Austin named Damond Stith who does African, historical</p>
<p>African martial arts.</p>
<p>Um, also martial arts of, uh, of enslaved Africans who would learn machete fighting</p>
<p>techniques in the Caribbean, South America.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably within a mile of us.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an amazing guy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to look him up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can I ask you for advice?</p>
<p>Can you give advice for young people, high school, college, you know, undergrads thinking</p>
<p>about their career, thinking about life, how to live a life that you&rsquo;d be proud of?</p>
<p>You think quite a bit about like what it&rsquo;s required to be innovative in this world.</p>
<p>You think quite a bit about the future.</p>
<p>So if somebody wanted to be a person that makes a big impact from the future, what advice</p>
<p>would you give them?</p>
<p>I think a big part of it is finding the thing that you will do happily and, um, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to say obsessively because that sounds like maybe it&rsquo;s pathological, but, but if</p>
<p>you can find a thing that you&rsquo;ll, you know, you&rsquo;ll sit down, you&rsquo;ll start doing it and</p>
<p>hours later you kind of snap out of it, where did the time go?</p>
<p>Um, then, um, that&rsquo;s a really key discovery for anyone to make about themselves when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>young.</p>
<p>Uh, because if you don&rsquo;t have that, um, it&rsquo;s hard to, uh, to figure out where you should</p>
<p>put your energies, you know, and as you might have the best intentions, you might say, I,</p>
<p>you know, I want world peace or whatever, uh, but, um, uh, at, at the end of the day,</p>
<p>what really matters is how do you spend your time and, and are you spending it in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s productive, uh, and, um, uh, because it doesn&rsquo;t matter how smart you are or well</p>
<p>intentioned you are unless you&rsquo;ve figured that out.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s finding the thing in which you can sort of, you naturally lose yourself in.</p>
<p>The thing is, um, at least for me, there&rsquo;s a lot of things like that, but I first have</p>
<p>to overcome the initial hump of really sucking at that thing.</p>
<p>Like the fun starts a little bit after the first hump of really sucking and then you</p>
<p>could suck just regular.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So often people, oftentimes people can give up too early, I think.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s true with mathematics for me, it&rsquo;s for a lot of people is if you just give</p>
<p>it a chance to struggle, if you give yourself time to struggle, you&rsquo;ll find a way, you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>find the thing within that thing that you can lose track of time with.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a key detail that, um, that&rsquo;s an important thing to add to, to what I said, which is</p>
<p>that, uh, this might not happen the first time you do a thing.</p>
<p>Maybe it will, but, um, uh, you might have to climb that learning curve and, um, if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pressures in your life that are making you feel bad about that, then, um, it might prevent</p>
<p>you from, from getting where you need to be.</p>
<p>Um, so there&rsquo;s some complexity there, uh, that make, can make this kind of non obvious.</p>
<p>Um, but, uh, that&rsquo;s what, that&rsquo;s why we need, you know, good teachers.</p>
<p>Um, you know, another beneficial thing, uh, of the internet is YouTube and being able</p>
<p>to learn things, how to do things on YouTube, the, the, the dude who made the YouTube video</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t care how many times you hit pause and rewind, um, they&rsquo;re never going to like</p>
<p>roll their eyes and, and be impatient with you.</p>
<p>Um, and sometimes, uh, spending a huge amount of time on one video or one book, like making</p>
<p>that the thing you just spent a huge amount of time on rereading, rereading, or rewatching,</p>
<p>rewatching that, that somehow really, um, solidifies your love for that thing.</p>
<p>And like the depth of understanding you start to gain and it&rsquo;s okay to stay with that.</p>
<p>I used to think like, there&rsquo;s all these books out there, so like, I need to keep reading</p>
<p>or keep reading.</p>
<p>But then I realized, um, I think it was somewhere in college, uh, uh, where you could just spend</p>
<p>your whole life with a single textbook.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing in that textbook to really, really stay.</p>
<p>Meisner, Thorne and Wheeler, Gravitation, you know, is, is one of those, or another one is,</p>
<p>um, The Road to Reality by Roger Penrose, which is just incredibly deep and it starts</p>
<p>with like two plus two equals four and it, at the end you&rsquo;re at the boundaries of, of</p>
<p>physics.</p>
<p>Uh, it&rsquo;s an amazing, amazing book.</p>
<p>Let me ask you the big ridiculous question.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve pondered some big ridiculous questions in your work.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of this whole thing?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Human life.</p>
<p>Well, as far as I know, we&rsquo;re unique in the, the universe.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no evidence that there&rsquo;s anything else in the universe that&rsquo;s as complicated</p>
<p>as what&rsquo;s between our ears.</p>
<p>Might be.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t rule it out, but, um, so we appear to be pretty special and, um, so it&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>to have something to do with that and one of the reasons I like David Deutsch, in particular</p>
<p>his book, The Beginning of Infinity, um, is that he talks about the power of explanations</p>
<p>and the fact that, um, most civilizations are static that they&rsquo;ve got a set of dogmas</p>
<p>that they arrive at somehow and they just pass those on from one, uh, generation to</p>
<p>the next and nothing changes.</p>
<p>But that huge changes have happened when people sort of follow whatever you want to call it,</p>
<p>the scientific method or enlightenment, uh, there&rsquo;s different ways of thinking about it,</p>
<p>but basically explanatory, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s about the power of, of explanations and being able</p>
<p>to figure out why things are the way they are and that has created changes in our, um,</p>
<p>thinking and our way of life over the last few centuries that are explosive compared</p>
<p>to anything that came before and David sort of verges on classifying this as like a force</p>
<p>of nature in its potential transformative power.</p>
<p>If we keep going, um, you know, we could, uh, you know, if we figure out how to colonize</p>
<p>the universe like you were talking about earlier, how to spread to other star systems, um, then</p>
<p>it is effectively a force of nature.</p>
<p>This kind of drive to understand more and more and more, deeper and deeper and deeper</p>
<p>and to engineer stuff so that we can understand even more.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, well, it&rsquo;s the old, the universe created us to understand itself.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s the, uh, the whole purpose.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It is an interesting peculiar side effect of the way we&rsquo;ve been created is we seem to</p>
<p>be conscious beings.</p>
<p>We seem to have little egos.</p>
<p>We seem to, uh, be born and die pretty quickly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of drama.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all within ourselves pretty unique and we fall in love and start wars and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hate and all the, the full interesting dynamic of it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just about the individual people, somehow like the concert that we played together.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of peculiar aspects of that, that, um, I wonder if they&rsquo;re fundamental</p>
<p>or just quirks of evolution, whether it&rsquo;s, whether it&rsquo;s death, whether it&rsquo;s love, whether</p>
<p>all those things, I wonder if they&rsquo;re, um, from an engineer perspective when we&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to create that intelligent toaster that listens for the, for the slam door and this, and the</p>
<p>smell of burning toast, whether, uh, that toaster should be afraid of death and should</p>
<p>fall in love just like we do, you know, you&rsquo;re a fascinating human being.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve impacted the lives of millions of people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge honor that you would spend your valuable time with me today.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thank you for coming down to beautiful, hot Texas.</p>
<p>And thank you for talking today.</p>
<p>It was a pleasure and I&rsquo;m glad I came and did it.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Neal Stephenson to support this podcast.</p>
<p>Please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Neal Stephenson himself in his novel, Snow</p>
<p>Crash.</p>
<p>The world is full of things more powerful than us, but if you know how to catch a ride,</p>
<p>you can go places.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
