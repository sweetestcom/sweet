<p>help this is why I kind of coined the</p>
<p>term healthy keto because</p>
<p>when you do keto it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>differentiate if you&rsquo;re doing you know</p>
<p>foods with pesticides insecticides</p>
<p>herbicides GMO also when you do keto</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not differentiating nutrient</p>
<p>dense foods versus</p>
<p>empty Foods again with keto you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>talking about macros moderate protein</p>
<p>low carb higher fat so I believe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the combination of both going low carb</p>
<p>and having healthy foods at the same</p>
<p>time I mean the real question is what</p>
<p>actually is a healthy food there are so</p>
<p>many opinions about this topic and is it</p>
<p>just a matter of having a food that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>organic well organic doesn&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>describe the nutrients it just tells you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s without certain synthetic chemicals</p>
<p>and antibiotics which is good</p>
<p>what about nutrient density so yes the</p>
<p>absence of certain pesticides</p>
<p>insecticides and the chemicals that are</p>
<p>sprayed when you have GMO foods are very</p>
<p>very unhealthy so that&rsquo;s part of it but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another part that I want to</p>
<p>discuss and part of this topic is</p>
<p>something you&rsquo;ve never heard before and</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re going to find it quite</p>
<p>interesting and this relates to nutrient</p>
<p>dense foods what makes a food nutrient</p>
<p>dense I mean you can look through the</p>
<p>database and let&rsquo;s just take for example</p>
<p>kale okay kale has a lot of nutrition</p>
<p>right it has a lot of vitamin C it has a</p>
<p>lot of beta-carotene you know if someone</p>
<p>took some test on Kale I don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>many years ago and said it was healthy</p>
<p>what about nowadays with the soil so</p>
<p>this is a big gray area I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about the specific nutrient amounts in</p>
<p>certain foods I mean it really depends</p>
<p>on a lot of factors a lot of variables</p>
<p>this is why it&rsquo;s difficult the soil how</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s processed you know what type of</p>
<p>farming methods that they use etc etc so</p>
<p>a really big factor in what determines</p>
<p>your health is that the animals and</p>
<p>plants that you eat I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>how nutrient dense those are now when we</p>
<p>were talking about an animal let&rsquo;s say a</p>
<p>cow</p>
<p>how does that cow become healthy well if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s grazed naturally on grass that is</p>
<p>really healthy and nutrient dense right</p>
<p>I mean makes sense what about a cow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s raised on grains or grain</p>
<p>finished okay like from a feed lot right</p>
<p>is that healthy well actually no because</p>
<p>of all the inflammatory conditions that</p>
<p>occur in the kind of stomach the large</p>
<p>amounts of acids and pH that are</p>
<p>developing because it&rsquo;s not normal for a</p>
<p>cow to consume grains for any period of</p>
<p>time so cows Were Meant to consume grass</p>
<p>but then the question comes how do you</p>
<p>make grass healthy well that comes from</p>
<p>the soil right you might think that it</p>
<p>comes from soil that is very very rich</p>
<p>in minerals right it&rsquo;s the minerals that</p>
<p>make the plants healthy well actually no</p>
<p>the plants have a hard time getting</p>
<p>minerals unless they get help from the</p>
<p>microbes okay so what I&rsquo;m going to share</p>
<p>with you today is some fascinating new</p>
<p>discoveries in the area of how microbes</p>
<p>help the plant</p>
<p>as well as the animal become super</p>
<p>nutrient dense okay now what people</p>
<p>normally know is that</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s minerals that are</p>
<p>available to that plant the plant&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be more nutrient dense right</p>
<p>and they might also know that the</p>
<p>microbes in the soil both bacteria and</p>
<p>fungus help to mobilize these nutrients</p>
<p>and bring them to the surface of the</p>
<p>roots where then the root absorbs the</p>
<p>nutrients but what you might not know</p>
<p>is something very very interesting and</p>
<p>that is that the root itself has the</p>
<p>potential</p>
<p>to absorb that microbe right into itself</p>
<p>okay and also up through the stem into</p>
<p>the leaf so the plant has its own</p>
<p>microbiome and that plant extracts</p>
<p>nutrients directly from the microbe and</p>
<p>many times it doesn&rsquo;t kill the microbe</p>
<p>it lets the microbe exit to rebuild and</p>
<p>this whole cycle starts again so a very</p>
<p>significant amount of nutrition in that</p>
<p>plant is dependent on these microbes I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking about</p>
<p>the diversity of microbes</p>
<p>as well as the quantities of microbes in</p>
<p>that soil that&rsquo;s what really builds</p>
<p>nutrient-dense plants and nutrient-dense</p>
<p>animal meat that we eat so I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>do a very fascinating interview with the</p>
<p>gentleman that is an expert and has</p>
<p>researched this topic and the reason I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking about it is that this is going</p>
<p>to change your entire Viewpoint of how</p>
<p>you look at food and what you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to look for to make sure it&rsquo;s nutrient</p>
<p>dense okay then after the short</p>
<p>interview I want to go right into the</p>
<p>best foods that you should be eating so</p>
<p>basically what you said Eric and that is</p>
<p>that this is something that people have</p>
<p>not appreciated and that is that plants</p>
<p>are</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re absorbing</p>
<p>microbes from the soil into their roots</p>
<p>and they are extracting nutrients from</p>
<p>those microbes and these are bacteria</p>
<p>and these are these are in some cases</p>
<p>fungi that get sucked into the to the</p>
<p>roots actually in the root cells detects</p>
<p>the microbes in the cells secrete</p>
<p>superoxide which is highly potent uh</p>
<p>form of reactive oxygen and then that</p>
<p>extracts nutrients from the microbes and</p>
<p>will degrade some of the microbes</p>
<p>completely</p>
<p>uh so this is this is all part of the</p>
<p>process called rhizophagy Rizo for root</p>
<p>Beijing means eating so root eating</p>
<p>process basically and uh this is this</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s not complicated I mean</p>
<p>basically uh plants are cultivating</p>
<p>microbes in the soil using their exudate</p>
<p>sugars and things that they ex secrete</p>
<p>from The Roots they cultivate those</p>
<p>microbes they attract the microbes to</p>
<p>the root they internalize them and they</p>
<p>degrade some of them and they force some</p>
<p>of them extract nutrients from others</p>
<p>they enforce them essentially to secrete</p>
<p>nutrients it&rsquo;s not a complicated process</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not like you have to</p>
<p>understand all this super amount of</p>
<p>biology these plants are basically are</p>
<p>internalizing microbes internalizing</p>
<p>microbes into their tissues and</p>
<p>degrading them and forcing them to</p>
<p>secrete nutrients that the plant can</p>
<p>acquire just as we have our own</p>
<p>microbiome our microbes inside of us and</p>
<p>on the surface of our skin plants</p>
<p>um do they just have microbes in the</p>
<p>roots or up into this stems in the</p>
<p>leaves and on the surface of the plant</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a beautiful question Eric okay uh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a beautiful question yeah yeah</p>
<p>plants absorb these microbes and fill</p>
<p>their tissues with these microbes and</p>
<p>build their cells with these microbes</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re bacteria that they take out of</p>
<p>the soil</p>
<p>and they move them through the flow and</p>
<p>through those vascular tissues they move</p>
<p>them up into the plant and so they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>colonize the leaves as well</p>
<p>understanding the relationship between</p>
<p>the microbe and the nutrients in the</p>
<p>food even I think I&rsquo;ve read one of your</p>
<p>your papers</p>
<p>um manganese is increase up to in one</p>
<p>study of up to 700 percent more when</p>
<p>when you have um have this thing</p>
<p>happening versus not having it happening</p>
<p>because I you also mention on the seed</p>
<p>when the seed is grown uh the seed has</p>
<p>microbes not just on the surface but</p>
<p>inside that then acts as a kind of a</p>
<p>a germinator or some type of a colostrum</p>
<p>or something that will kind of start the</p>
<p>process going and if you don&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>if you buy a seed that&rsquo;s sterile for</p>
<p>example or then you don&rsquo;t get this you</p>
<p>get this you get this um lessening</p>
<p>effect right of of different things and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked about that a seed</p>
<p>is like a little noaa&rsquo;s Arc</p>
<p>it has the plant and it has uh it has a</p>
<p>little bit of food stuff in there and it</p>
<p>has the microbes that the plant needs</p>
<p>and the if those microbes are if you</p>
<p>sterilize the seed or those microbes are</p>
<p>lost in the seed that compromises</p>
<p>development of the plant the the</p>
<p>seedling just doesn&rsquo;t grow right you</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t get root hairs you&rsquo;ll have a</p>
<p>anomalous growth they&rsquo;ll be short Roots</p>
<p>you may not have much branching you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have short uh short a slightly shorter</p>
<p>uh shoots on the plant uh plants don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>grow properly they need these microbes</p>
<p>in them in order to grow appropriately</p>
<p>microbes are gone they don&rsquo;t grow they</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t grow well they&rsquo;ll be susceptible</p>
<p>to disease you can make them grow if you</p>
<p>squirt fertilizer on them right chemical</p>
<p>fertilizers that will make them grow but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not going to be as Hardy as they</p>
<p>would be if they had my microbes there</p>
<p>if they do their they have their</p>
<p>microbes they&rsquo;re getting nutrients from</p>
<p>those microbes they have to work for</p>
<p>that using uh using new well superoxide</p>
<p>reactive oxygen to secrete onto those</p>
<p>microbes and that causes the plant to</p>
<p>really become resistant to oxygen</p>
<p>reactive oxygen and that is reactive</p>
<p>oxygen uh is what causes stress okay and</p>
<p>you mentioned the stress hormone the</p>
<p>ethylene before you know because these</p>
<p>microbes are producing ethylene which</p>
<p>also causes stress and maturation you</p>
<p>know the ethylene will cause the plant</p>
<p>to mature but it also could cause a</p>
<p>little stress and that causes the plant</p>
<p>to upregulate its stress defense and</p>
<p>becomes uh more resistant to any kind of</p>
<p>oxidative stress which is any kind of</p>
<p>stress so plants are heartier and</p>
<p>tougher they can withstand doubt drought</p>
<p>drought dry periods they can withstand</p>
<p>some diseases they can withstand soil uh</p>
<p>heavy metals or high salt tolerance what</p>
<p>about that that story or just tell us a</p>
<p>summary of the story of the the Indians</p>
<p>that used to unknowingly have uh started</p>
<p>to take the seeds and do something with</p>
<p>them yeah well you know the Indians I</p>
<p>mean we know they were not they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have microscopes so right but yet you</p>
<p>know I mean this goes back to you know</p>
<p>people even primitive cultures where are</p>
<p>extremely capable and they figured</p>
<p>things out and in this case they the</p>
<p>Iroquois Indians developed something for</p>
<p>corn</p>
<p>uh that that has come to be called the</p>
<p>the Iroquois corn medicine and uh</p>
<p>uh with the airport corn medicine what</p>
<p>what they what the Indians would do is</p>
<p>they would actually get biostimulant</p>
<p>microbes and they would put on their</p>
<p>corn and uh just to give a little</p>
<p>background corn typically the way corn</p>
<p>is cultivated by the indigenous</p>
<p>Americans indigenous peoples was they</p>
<p>would they would get the corn from the</p>
<p>fields and they would hang it to dry you</p>
<p>know when as soon as the corn was formed</p>
<p>they would hang for the seed corn uh</p>
<p>they would eat what they were gonna eat</p>
<p>but they would hang this seed around and</p>
<p>typically they would pick it a little</p>
<p>bit early just a little bit early and</p>
<p>then let the seed dry and this early</p>
<p>picking uh actually has an effect on the</p>
<p>microbiome of the plant and what happens</p>
<p>is the microbiomes don&rsquo;t develop fully</p>
<p>unless the plant unless the seed is left</p>
<p>out in nature for a long time and then</p>
<p>you have in the moisture and you have</p>
<p>lots of moisture there and you have</p>
<p>microbes then growing on the seeds so</p>
<p>the microbiome</p>
<p>uh takes time to develop and so people</p>
<p>tend to pick it early get the seed put</p>
<p>it in a dry as driest possible place</p>
<p>which suppresses that microbiome</p>
<p>development and then this the plants</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t grow quite as well but with the</p>
<p>Iroquois Indian corn medicine the corn</p>
<p>medicine what they would do get the wild</p>
<p>grasses from The Woodlands</p>
<p>bring the roots put it in water chop up</p>
<p>those roots so you get the microbes out</p>
<p>of it into the water then they would</p>
<p>take their corn</p>
<p>that they were about to plant in their</p>
<p>fields and then they would let it</p>
<p>germinate just slightly in that water to</p>
<p>get the bacteria to colonize those roots</p>
<p>then they would take that and they would</p>
<p>put that they would plant that like that</p>
<p>this is the corn medicine so they were</p>
<p>using biostimulant microbes before</p>
<p>uh we even knew there were microbes</p>
<p>there how the heck did they figure that</p>
<p>out that&rsquo;s just brilliant when I find a</p>
<p>good product I always like to mention it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not getting any Kickbacks but I just</p>
<p>want to let</p>
<p>you just tell people briefly what this</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>sure yeah thank you thank you for having</p>
<p>me on uh microbiometer on every little</p>
<p>kit I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>came back from a trade show</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s a little kit sort of like a</p>
<p>little kids science experiment it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>totally safe you can do it your kids can</p>
<p>do it and and the objective is to give</p>
<p>people data and knowledge about what</p>
<p>microbes how diverse and large their</p>
<p>microbial population is in soil</p>
<p>um I think it was really neat what James</p>
<p>said that you know we used to think</p>
<p>about soil as chemical now we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking as biological but I think</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s really cool is now we&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about nutrition not as chemical but as</p>
<p>nutrition is biological right so I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just very interesting to say you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s sort of like saying do you</p>
<p>think I could live just by eating</p>
<p>multivitamins right well no I need to</p>
<p>eat food well why because I am ingesting</p>
<p>microbes my gut needs microbes right to</p>
<p>digest food just like a plant does so</p>
<p>the microbiometer was was designed so</p>
<p>that people can start to Benchmark their</p>
<p>soil whether it&rsquo;s their lawn their</p>
<p>Garden their Farm it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>Agricultural Product to say okay you</p>
<p>know here&rsquo;s a numerical reading of my</p>
<p>soil as I move away from glycophate and</p>
<p>NPK and chemical fertilizers and I try</p>
<p>to get</p>
<p>the biological processes of science to</p>
<p>release</p>
<p>um nutrients and create nutrients</p>
<p>frankly right we we think that like</p>
<p>Roots mine the soil and microbes mind</p>
<p>the soil but they actually are are</p>
<p>producing things</p>
<p>um to say here&rsquo;s As you move from</p>
<p>practices say I mean no-till maybe you</p>
<p>stop glycophate maybe you do cover crops</p>
<p>you can measure it yourself on our</p>
<p>little phone app wherever you are in the</p>
<p>world particularly small old farmers who</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t afford Chemical Testing can start</p>
<p>getting that massive information well I</p>
<p>really appreciate your time</p>
<p>um and this data this is fantastic and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put the links down below for the</p>
<p>book as well as the microbiometer and</p>
<p>thank you for your insights uh this has</p>
<p>been awesome hey we&rsquo;re back</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s go ahead and talk about the</p>
<p>best foods that you can eat based on</p>
<p>this information and applying it to your</p>
<p>own life so the question is what is the</p>
<p>healthiest foods well it&rsquo;s those foods</p>
<p>that are grown on soil with the most</p>
<p>microbes and the most biodiverse</p>
<p>microbes and the worst foods are foods</p>
<p>that are grown on dirt okay without</p>
<p>microbes and that&rsquo;s really what the</p>
<p>definition of dirt is soil is with</p>
<p>microbes dirt is without microbes so if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re growing some plant commercially</p>
<p>on the typical you know nitrogen</p>
<p>phosphorus potassium mpk you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to get all your nutrients yes</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll look good but are they nutrient</p>
<p>dense so in other words the missing link</p>
<p>to this whole thing is the microbe okay</p>
<p>the microbes help us not only with our</p>
<p>own absorption in our bodies but also in</p>
<p>the soil to turn that food into</p>
<p>nutrient-dense Foods all right I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to go through a few things okay so yes</p>
<p>we need to do organic food</p>
<p>um ideally organic means without</p>
<p>pesticides and as you know there there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a very popular chemical or poison that</p>
<p>is put on a lot of our foods and our</p>
<p>soil around the world actually and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called glyphosate so the foods</p>
<p>that have glyphosate which are the</p>
<p>Roundup Ready type foods which are seeds</p>
<p>that grow into these plants that resist</p>
<p>this specific herbicide killing the</p>
<p>other things but not itself so corn soy</p>
<p>beets canola cotton but you also have</p>
<p>this chemical spread in other plants</p>
<p>that are not gml like wheat oats and</p>
<p>many other things like legumes and beans</p>
<p>and things like that but the other big</p>
<p>problem is 95 percent of the animals</p>
<p>that we eat are fed food that has</p>
<p>glyphosate but the point I want to bring</p>
<p>up is that glyphosate is also an</p>
<p>antibiotic that&rsquo;s right if you look up</p>
<p>the patents on glyphosate they applied</p>
<p>and I think they got approved the patent</p>
<p>of glyphosate being an antibiotic now</p>
<p>why is that so important to understand</p>
<p>because if you apply an antibiotic to</p>
<p>the soil you will greatly diminish the</p>
<p>nutrient absorption into that plant</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re lessening the microbes</p>
<p>same thing happens with our body so this</p>
<p>is why organic is important now the</p>
<p>other point is grass-fed animals right</p>
<p>and grass-fed grass finished that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>real key thing or it could be just a</p>
<p>hundred percent grass-fed beef for</p>
<p>example because when the cow eats the</p>
<p>grains the nutrition becomes less with</p>
<p>their own digestion and the cow gets</p>
<p>more microbes from eating that grass not</p>
<p>only from the feeding of fiber but also</p>
<p>from the microbes directly in that grass</p>
<p>okay and this this is why we also can</p>
<p>get uh friendly bacteria from raw</p>
<p>vegetables that we consume that are</p>
<p>actually in the right kind of soils all</p>
<p>right number two raw vegetables raw</p>
<p>vegetables that are grown on soil</p>
<p>Hydroponics don&rsquo;t have the quantity of</p>
<p>microbes and the diversity of microbes</p>
<p>unfortunately plants were not designed</p>
<p>to be grown hydroponically I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>saying not to consume them you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>not going to get the level of nutrition</p>
<p>that you would get from actually growing</p>
<p>plants on soil of course there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>sorts of plants and herbs and vegetables</p>
<p>that you can get as far as their</p>
<p>nutrient density ideally which is not</p>
<p>easy to do which I&rsquo;m trying to find a</p>
<p>way to make it more available is to get</p>
<p>your food from the local farmer there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a program called CSA where a local</p>
<p>farmer and someone in the local</p>
<p>community have this Arrangement where</p>
<p>the consumer will pay a fee and get</p>
<p>regular produce from that farmer and I</p>
<p>really think the way to do it is to do</p>
<p>it locally because of the problem with</p>
<p>transportation and food going bad in the</p>
<p>winter in America when you buy a tomato</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting your Tomatoes well 80 of</p>
<p>the time from</p>
<p>Florida where they pick them completely</p>
<p>unripened and they use certain gases to</p>
<p>ripen them but they&rsquo;re completely void</p>
<p>of any nutrition so the point is if you</p>
<p>can have an arrangement with a farmer</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s locally and that farmer can be</p>
<p>guaranteed that they will have a sale</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be guaranteed you&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>some food it&rsquo;s really the optimum</p>
<p>Arrangement because you can avoid the</p>
<p>cost and transportation you can possibly</p>
<p>even visit the farmer to check out their</p>
<p>soils to make sure that they&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>healthy and it&rsquo;s also important to eat</p>
<p>foods that are seasonal and again that</p>
<p>aligns with the local Farmer and the</p>
<p>produce that you&rsquo;d be getting the next</p>
<p>best option would be to go to the</p>
<p>farmers market and of course the best</p>
<p>option would be to have your own garden</p>
<p>so you can control everything but not</p>
<p>everyone has the space all right the</p>
<p>next point I already mentioned this is</p>
<p>to try to get plants that are grown in</p>
<p>soil not necessarily majority grown in</p>
<p>hydroponic like a lot of the salad that</p>
<p>you get from the grocery store it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hydroponic so it doesn&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>microbes I mean I still consume salad</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s grown hydroponically but I try to</p>
<p>get it from actual soil So when you buy</p>
<p>these salads that are already clean for</p>
<p>you and they&rsquo;re all cut up and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>any plastic containers chances are</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re hydroponic versus the other type</p>
<p>of vegetables that are in a slightly</p>
<p>different section of the grocery store</p>
<p>usually those are grown on soil and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re more of a painful but because</p>
<p>you have to clean them and you have to</p>
<p>chop them up but they are more nutrient</p>
<p>dense another point about healthy foods</p>
<p>wild caught versus farm raised okay fish</p>
<p>and seafood very important and also if</p>
<p>you were to buy cheese from Europe</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s raw that&rsquo;s a lot better than the</p>
<p>pasteurized why because it has more</p>
<p>microbes okay the fermented products</p>
<p>from dairy like cheese kefir are the</p>
<p>ones that are actually pretty good for</p>
<p>your gut of course some people have</p>
<p>allergies to milk products but I will</p>
<p>say that unfortunately milk is</p>
<p>pasteurized it&rsquo;s hard to find it raw and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done videos on finding it raw and</p>
<p>then making your own kefir that would be</p>
<p>a really good thing to do but that takes</p>
<p>time but realize that when they</p>
<p>pasteurize milk they&rsquo;re killing</p>
<p>everything in it okay they&rsquo;re killing</p>
<p>all the pathogens as well as the good</p>
<p>bacteria so if you could find</p>
<p>um raw milk cheese from Europe which you</p>
<p>can now it&rsquo;s illegal if I&rsquo;m not mistaken</p>
<p>to sell raw cheese in America but when</p>
<p>they ship it from Europe apparently it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still illegal but they just pay the fine</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why it costs so much but I</p>
<p>consume raw cheese and it is a healthy</p>
<p>product and that would be a way to eat</p>
<p>something that is enhanced with microbes</p>
<p>and of course I even get butter from a</p>
<p>local farmer that is raw butter which is</p>
<p>way better than the pasteurized butter</p>
<p>now as far as the vegetables go to help</p>
<p>your liver out of all the vegetables</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the cruciferous that help you the</p>
<p>most so we&rsquo;re talking about cabbage kale</p>
<p>broccoli brussels sprouts not even just</p>
<p>the nutrients but the phytonutrients</p>
<p>okay I didn&rsquo;t even cover that but those</p>
<p>are also greatly enhanced with microbes</p>
<p>as well so getting cruciferous</p>
<p>vegetables from a really great farmer</p>
<p>who uses great methods of growing these</p>
<p>vegetables is like so important then if</p>
<p>you were to ferment these vegetables as</p>
<p>in sauerkraut or kimchi you would take</p>
<p>it to the next level why because of the</p>
<p>addition of microbes I&rsquo;m trying to hit</p>
<p>this really important point over and</p>
<p>over with a hammer so you really get it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the microbes that make our food</p>
<p>healthy and of course pasture-raised</p>
<p>organic eggs right so you have these</p>
<p>chickens that roam around and eat bugs</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re eating microbes indirectly</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of microbes in the</p>
<p>bug and that all helps that chicken</p>
<p>especially if they&rsquo;re fed grains where</p>
<p>the farmer actually ferments the grain</p>
<p>which I do you soak this organic grain</p>
<p>in water for three days and you feed it</p>
<p>to the chickens they love it and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>extremely healthy because in the</p>
<p>fermentation process you get these added</p>
<p>microbes so there&rsquo;s a couple other</p>
<p>points that I want to just kind of end</p>
<p>with with number one avoid foods that</p>
<p>have glyphosate I&rsquo;ve already covered</p>
<p>that okay avoid foods that are</p>
<p>irradiated yes they use radiation to</p>
<p>sterilize the foods and there&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>symbol I&rsquo;ll put up right now that you</p>
<p>can now identify those foods that are</p>
<p>radiated and avoid them okay if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t buy them then the manufacturing</p>
<p>companies that make them will not use</p>
<p>them as much okay so you can contribute</p>
<p>with your dollar and just not buying</p>
<p>them now anything that&rsquo;s pasteurized</p>
<p>like milk like juice like even things in</p>
<p>cans like canned soup are void of good</p>
<p>bacteria so they&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>contribute to healthy liver function I</p>
<p>already mentioned hydroponic versus</p>
<p>growing in the soil if you have the</p>
<p>option</p>
<p>go with the ones in the soil and of</p>
<p>course there&rsquo;s three more things that</p>
<p>are really bad for your liver that you</p>
<p>may already know about but it&rsquo;s of</p>
<p>course refined sugars okay refined</p>
<p>carbohydrates grains of any kind seed</p>
<p>oils all of this is very high in omega-6</p>
<p>which is inflammatory to the liver and</p>
<p>other refined Foods especially the soy</p>
<p>protein isolates okay and even the whey</p>
<p>protein is harder on the liver so now</p>
<p>you know something new to help you</p>
<p>identify what foods are the healthy</p>
<p>version of the ketogenic diet now if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re new to the ketogenic diet you</p>
<p>really need to watch this video right</p>
<p>here check it out</p>
