<p>has no carbohydrates and basically one</p>
<p>and then I have something about six</p>
<p>o&rsquo;clock I probably should have a meal so</p>
<p>so here the good thing is you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>craving sweet things right you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>craving a fat no so that&rsquo;s good I think</p>
<p>something missing well I think what I</p>
<p>would do is you want to transition to</p>
<p>this really nice and smoothly the fact</p>
<p>that you crave anything or you&rsquo;re even</p>
<p>hungry for anything means you might want</p>
<p>to back out of it a little bit and have</p>
<p>maybe two solid meals like real good</p>
<p>meals with the potassium the vegetables</p>
<p>and then maybe add some peanut butter to</p>
<p>that meal that&rsquo;s what I would do because</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going a little too fast that</p>
<p>can kind of throw you off a little bit</p>
<p>so just back it down oh you&rsquo;re freezing</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re cold yeah you&rsquo;re yeah that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>low blood sugar thing so you just have</p>
<p>to back out of it a little bit and you</p>
<p>know you start with three meals and two</p>
<p>meals in one meal</p>
<p>so if you go too fast then you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>adapted Foley so you&rsquo;re in the phase of</p>
<p>adaptation you just need to spend a</p>
<p>little more time with maybe two meals</p>
<p>really good healthy nails</p>
<p>okay sure all right on any of my things</p>
<p>so this is all I get</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t go live what won&rsquo;t go live</p>
<p>Facebook or YouTube neither one of them</p>
<p>are going live well your your live now</p>
<p>so everyone&rsquo;s here you know I know but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not on my computer oh I got it well</p>
<p>hey keep trying thanks Debbie hey Brooke</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been um you&rsquo;ve been on the line</p>
<p>for a while to you you&rsquo;re also from</p>
<p>Tennessee you had a question about warts</p>
<p>and thirst go ahead I had worked when I</p>
<p>was a kid you know like on my hands and</p>
<p>my knees in my feet and I also had them</p>
<p>on my eyelid those little weird more so</p>
<p>people get on their eyelid and the</p>
<p>doctors say that there&rsquo;s no way to</p>
<p>prevent them you can just like having</p>
<p>lasered off afros offer like have them</p>
<p>clipped off and I would like to know how</p>
<p>to prevent those I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s bite</p>
<p>of the venom and then why am I getting</p>
<p>so thirsty after I eat because like I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t eat any sugar okay so quick</p>
<p>question about the thirst do you have a</p>
<p>history of eating other sugar yes okay</p>
<p>did you just start the the keto and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting okay has the thirst</p>
<p>then increased as you started doing it</p>
<p>the first I just started like this not</p>
<p>okay well good so let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s talk about</p>
<p>that I just first of all in are just to</p>
<p>give everyone a disclaimer everything</p>
<p>that I say and recommend is really not</p>
<p>meant to diagnose anyone check with your</p>
<p>doctor before taking all these these</p>
<p>recommendations that I might give you</p>
<p>with you know based on my opinion but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s meant for your entertainment and</p>
<p>education to do research okay that being</p>
<p>said as far as the warts go</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s usually a viral problem and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some great remedies out</p>
<p>for viruses one is something called mono</p>
<p>Lauren mono Lauren okay it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>concentrated compound in coconut oil and</p>
<p>get it online give it Amazon go to</p>
<p>health food store mana Lauren it&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>of the best things I know for viruses</p>
<p>you take small amounts over a long</p>
<p>period of time and then you can start</p>
<p>beefing up a little bit more but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a really good for thing for virus is a</p>
<p>natural thing with I don&rsquo;t know of any</p>
<p>side effects okay so as far as your</p>
<p>thirst goes typically if you&rsquo;re extra</p>
<p>thirsty it could even be a blood sugar</p>
<p>problem pre-diabetes because diabetics</p>
<p>usually have a lot of sugar problems</p>
<p>when the sugar is really high and then</p>
<p>what happens is wherever the sugar goes</p>
<p>the water goes so the sugar goes out of</p>
<p>the urine and the water goes out so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re peeing more and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thirsty more that can be a blood sugar</p>
<p>thing</p>
<p>however if if you&rsquo;re doing this for two</p>
<p>months and maybe other things are</p>
<p>improving but let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re more</p>
<p>thirsty it could be you need more</p>
<p>hydration or more quantity of fluids in</p>
<p>general because think about it when you</p>
<p>do the keto which is low carb you are</p>
<p>getting rid of all the excess fluid in</p>
<p>the body it&rsquo;s almost like a natural</p>
<p>diuretic and that&rsquo;s why you need to keep</p>
<p>your electrolytes very very high and and</p>
<p>the one that you need to keep high is</p>
<p>the sodium the salt and that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>people forget that you need at minimally</p>
<p>a teaspoon a day and that would give you</p>
<p>about 2300 milligrams salt is composed</p>
<p>of table cells composed of sodium and</p>
<p>chloride so in table salt salt would be</p>
<p>sodium you get about 40% but then the</p>
<p>other 60% is chlorides so to get the</p>
<p>necessary sodium that you need you need</p>
<p>a teaspoon of salt so I would add more</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll retain more fluid you have more</p>
<p>volume your blood pressure if it was low</p>
<p>will come up to a good range but also</p>
<p>low so salt diets also worsen insulin</p>
<p>resistance which is interesting so I</p>
<p>think just by adding a little salt</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll like fix everything and then be</p>
<p>okay if you&rsquo;re thirsty just drink more</p>
<p>water and I think you&rsquo;ll be totally fine</p>
<p>alright thanks for calling Brooke so do</p>
<p>we have any questions coming off the</p>
<p>Facebook here the Facebook yes so and on</p>
<p>the YouTube we have Michael asked about</p>
<p>keto for a very fatty liver yeah okay</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what happens when you dookied out</p>
<p>hopefully are you doing in a minute</p>
<p>fasting too you&rsquo;re dropping insulin down</p>
<p>which means that you&rsquo;re gonna mobilize</p>
<p>and release a lot of fat from your fat</p>
<p>cell and as this fat comes out it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna come through your bloodstream and</p>
<p>it has to go through the liver to then</p>
<p>come out as well and if you are not</p>
<p>consuming enough of these things called</p>
<p>vegetables if you&rsquo;re not consuming</p>
<p>enough quantity of vegetables okay</p>
<p>salads then you could potentially end up</p>
<p>with the fatty liver I&rsquo;m just letting</p>
<p>you know so you want to keep your</p>
<p>vegetables very high and you know to</p>
<p>worry about it in fact doing that will</p>
<p>then actually reduce fat on your liver</p>
<p>so yes keto is one of the best things to</p>
<p>get rid of fat off your liver because</p>
<p>the actual underlying cause of a fatty</p>
<p>liver is high insulin which can come</p>
<p>from sugar or eating too frequently and</p>
<p>and also definitely high fructose corn</p>
<p>syrup will do it more than more than</p>
<p>regular sugar so good I have another one</p>
<p>okay okay good so Noreen on Facebook is</p>
<p>asking can she do the keto diet if she</p>
<p>is has adrenal fatigue well I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be if you have four Drina fatigue</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the thing you need to do to lower</p>
<p>stress being on a carbohydrate diet</p>
<p>especially a high carbohydrate diet is</p>
<p>is stress on the adrenals fat burning</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re burning fat is a low stress thing</p>
<p>ketones are very low stress on the</p>
<p>nervous system and by the way half of</p>
<p>your adrenal is neurological tissue so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna actually reduce stress the</p>
<p>thing that people are confused about is</p>
<p>the intimate fasting portion of this</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not eating and then your</p>
<p>blood sugars aren&rsquo;t ready for it</p>
<p>so cortisol which is the adrenal hormone</p>
<p>tends to break down protein a little</p>
<p>faster and releases turns it into sugar</p>
<p>and it can elevate your sugar but what</p>
<p>if you go at this at a</p>
<p>very nice gradual pace we&rsquo;re doing three</p>
<p>meals no snacks and then slowly take</p>
<p>that breakfast and start inching it</p>
<p>towards lunch it&rsquo;ll be the best thing</p>
<p>for the adrenals just make sure that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re consuming a lot of electrolytes</p>
<p>like potassium and magnesium and sodium</p>
<p>for the adrenals I use the electrolyte</p>
<p>power for that powder it for that and</p>
<p>then also the B vitamins very important</p>
<p>nutritional yeast is key those two</p>
<p>things will really help your adrenals as</p>
<p>you make the transition but yeah carbs</p>
<p>are not good for the adrenal at all now</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go to a call from Paula you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from Philadelphia you had a question on</p>
<p>the adrenal as well and the thyroid tell</p>
<p>me tell me what will be your question hi</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been having a lot of adrenal issues</p>
<p>not really fatigue but I noticed like I</p>
<p>have an increased heart rate and like my</p>
<p>blood sugar is all over the place like I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get that into control and I tried</p>
<p>to do keto but like I have a gallstone</p>
<p>if I measured it like one point six</p>
<p>centimeters and when I tried like in the</p>
<p>morning I&rsquo;ll have the like three eggs</p>
<p>with butter avocado and bacon and I take</p>
<p>the gallbladder formula like one pill</p>
<p>afterwards and I drink apple cider</p>
<p>vinegar before and I have problems like</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t um and my blood sugar drops</p>
<p>through the night like it drops all day</p>
<p>long I gotta keep I can&rsquo;t get a control</p>
<p>of it even though I&rsquo;m adding a lot of</p>
<p>fats to my meals I can&rsquo;t go three meals</p>
<p>a day I got to do like like every four</p>
<p>hours I have to eat yeah I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>exactly what&rsquo;s the quantity of</p>
<p>vegetables that you&rsquo;re consuming in the</p>
<p>morning I blend up to big handfuls of</p>
<p>spinach and I put a lot of stuff in it</p>
<p>like maca maca powder MCT oil just</p>
<p>different chia seeds a bunch of stuff</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll drink that too like around ten</p>
<p>o&rsquo;clock and and then I have a salad for</p>
<p>lunch</p>
<p>and then I eat like cauliflower man</p>
<p>potatoes I keep that on hand make that</p>
<p>with butter and sour cream and I might</p>
<p>have like you know steamed broccoli at</p>
<p>dinner time with a protein</p>
<p>okay but I just can&rsquo;t get a hold of you</p>
<p>handle on it so there&rsquo;s like let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>talk about this I think this brings up a</p>
<p>really good point if someone has like a</p>
<p>really dysfunctional adrenal thing what</p>
<p>happens is that you have this circadian</p>
<p>wave of adrenal hormones that will</p>
<p>normally it&rsquo;s supposed to spike at 8</p>
<p>o&rsquo;clock in the morning and that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>even when you do in a minute fasting</p>
<p>when you get this spike at 8 o&rsquo;clock you</p>
<p>can have a higher level of cortisol and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s normal and that alone can start</p>
<p>dropping your blood sugars and you end</p>
<p>up with low blood sugars that&rsquo;s why some</p>
<p>people have like a false sense of hunger</p>
<p>about 8 o&rsquo;clock in the morning because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like why am i hungry I shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be hungry that&rsquo;s just the cortisol doing</p>
<p>this whole blood sugar thing it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be a temporary thing just push</p>
<p>through it and you&rsquo;ll be fine so but if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s happening like a 2 o&rsquo;clock in the</p>
<p>morning that&rsquo;s probably you know adrenal</p>
<p>issues as well especially through the</p>
<p>day if it&rsquo;s off but especially if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>high but there&rsquo;s a couple things that</p>
<p>you have to realize you&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>this whole keto with an adrenal with a</p>
<p>gallstone you&rsquo;re gonna have to focus</p>
<p>really on dissolving that stone with</p>
<p>maybe a little more bile salts maybe two</p>
<p>with each meal I would add choline as a</p>
<p>supplement you can get it as a powder</p>
<p>put that in your shake and start</p>
<p>consuming that I would add a non-gmo</p>
<p>lecithin to that as well so you can</p>
<p>start to those are just high in certain</p>
<p>properties phosphates to help dissolve</p>
<p>this gallstone and then will happen that</p>
<p>will become less and less I would not</p>
<p>add extra oil to your diet that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>only come with the food I wouldn&rsquo;t add</p>
<p>MCT oil because it just what happens the</p>
<p>oil stimulates the bile and it actually</p>
<p>causes a contraction of the gallbladder</p>
<p>so that can irritate your gallbladder I</p>
<p>would do acupressure on the pancreas and</p>
<p>then I have different videos on that as</p>
<p>well probably not on your gallbladder</p>
<p>but than the pancreas because you want</p>
<p>to start supporting the pancreas so that</p>
<p>would all help and then</p>
<p>beefed up your vegetables a little bit</p>
<p>more because the fact that your pulse</p>
<p>rate is a little higher tells me that</p>
<p>you need more potassium so in that shake</p>
<p>if you were to add parsley kale and beet</p>
<p>tops</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;ll give you the nice icing</p>
<p>on the cake or that I shouldn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>icing on the cake that&rsquo;ll give you the</p>
<p>meat and potatoes no no it&rsquo;ll give you</p>
<p>the necessary nutrients to help give you</p>
<p>the edge of bringing that heart rate</p>
<p>down also be one from the attritional</p>
<p>yeast will bring the pulse rate down -</p>
<p>these are just little tips and then try</p>
<p>like heck to start doing in a minute</p>
<p>fasting as soon as possible adding more</p>
<p>a little more fat to the meal because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really gonna help you all right</p>
<p>Paula hey Joe Joey I think it&rsquo;s Joe aim</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Utah go ahead I probably</p>
<p>dropped that um that&rsquo;s okay back in</p>
<p>April I had a complete bloodwork done I</p>
<p>knew something was wrong I knew it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t right they did a complete blood</p>
<p>work came back insulin resistance got it</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re here I hear you</p>
<p>everything okay okay okay</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s I actually had insulin test</p>
<p>which I know that most doctors don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>they only do the glucose yeah so I was</p>
<p>at 22.2 and she told me diabetes starts</p>
<p>around 25 so she put me on metformin and</p>
<p>of course I told her I wasn&rsquo;t gonna stay</p>
<p>on a drug until I could figure out how</p>
<p>to solve the problem because medication</p>
<p>for me is not the answer</p>
<p>so I found you and in six months I lost</p>
<p>15 pounds my insulin of my last blood</p>
<p>test went from 22 to 217 I&rsquo;m now off the</p>
<p>metformin but I still have a body fat</p>
<p>that won&rsquo;t come off I have been stuck</p>
<p>for the past two months I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>nothing zero all my levels are pretty</p>
<p>good and but I&rsquo;m wondering if it may</p>
<p>have some and I do everything I do to</p>
<p>treat your nutritional yeast I do your</p>
<p>wheatgrass I do potassium magnesium I do</p>
<p>your gall bladder formula I do you name</p>
<p>it I do it</p>
<p>although I</p>
<p>hysterectomies a few years ago so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>wondering if my body type has changed</p>
<p>and maybe I&rsquo;m stuck there and also my</p>
<p>thyroid levels said they were high but</p>
<p>she said it wasn&rsquo;t a concern because</p>
<p>everything else t4 t3 a1c is all in</p>
<p>normal ranges so she was high high</p>
<p>thyroid stimulating hormone right</p>
<p>the thyroid tpo is high okay okay so so</p>
<p>I also take progestogen and extra dal</p>
<p>because and I&rsquo;ve been taking those for a</p>
<p>long time since I was in my 30s because</p>
<p>I had low levels of both of those okay</p>
<p>so really really quick because I have a</p>
<p>lot of collars I just wanted to find out</p>
<p>are you doing in a minute fasting yeah</p>
<p>okay how many meals a day - okay so and</p>
<p>how far a claw how close are they</p>
<p>I do intermittent fasting 17 hours so I</p>
<p>try to eat within that a 7 hour period</p>
<p>okay good question so let me just kind</p>
<p>of tell you doing a lot of things right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s improving but now we have to</p>
<p>tweak it I think you&rsquo;re gonna be left</p>
<p>with trying to shorten that period of</p>
<p>time within a minute fasting to try to</p>
<p>get it closer and closer and closer to</p>
<p>the point where you&rsquo;re even doing one</p>
<p>meal a day and the reason for that is</p>
<p>because you have hysterectomy that takes</p>
<p>out one piece of the puzzle now puts</p>
<p>more stress than adrenal so and then it</p>
<p>throws off the thyroid - so I think your</p>
<p>solution would be to tighten up the time</p>
<p>between meals so try to do it</p>
<p>shoot for 20 meals to 20 hours of</p>
<p>fasting go for that until you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>comfortable adding more fat and then</p>
<p>start switching it so you&rsquo;re like doing</p>
<p>maybe one long meal between two hours</p>
<p>and then down to one meal I think that</p>
<p>is what you&rsquo;re going to need right now</p>
<p>because your insulin was way too high</p>
<p>and then that way that will ultimately</p>
<p>just heal that area but you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>everything right that&rsquo;s what I would do</p>
<p>to tweak it okay thanks for your call</p>
<p>hey Karen did you have a question we</p>
<p>have a bunch of questions on social</p>
<p>here Cinda and a bunch of other people</p>
<p>are asking about fats either MC tees or</p>
<p>their fish oil in their daily</p>
<p>supplements is that going to break the</p>
<p>fast is that going to have some negative</p>
<p>effect on their fast well this is a</p>
<p>really good question what about liquids</p>
<p>what about fats what about supplements</p>
<p>what about carbs and supplements all</p>
<p>these different things let&rsquo;s just cover</p>
<p>it well it really depends on how many</p>
<p>calories or how much how much mass that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re consuming that will then trigger</p>
<p>insulin if you&rsquo;re doing a very small</p>
<p>amount of fat it&rsquo;s gonna probably spike</p>
<p>it just a tiny little bit okay but if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing a small amount of carbon</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll spike it a lot so you want to</p>
<p>evaluate you know the quantities I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>crazy about a lot of people jumping into</p>
<p>the MTC&rsquo;s if they have any call better</p>
<p>issues MCT issues if they have</p>
<p>gallbladder issues however if if they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a gallbladder issue it might</p>
<p>be a good thing the one of the big</p>
<p>things they really need is the omega-3</p>
<p>fatty acids and you get that from flax</p>
<p>oil and fish oils but I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>recommend a high quality cod liver oil</p>
<p>virgin olive oil as the best thing so</p>
<p>those are the two fats that you would</p>
<p>need more than anything and if you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>consumed that in a supplement or just</p>
<p>the liquid it&rsquo;s gonna stimulate insulin</p>
<p>such an insignificant amount you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna have to worry about it but when</p>
<p>you get an empty oil then you start</p>
<p>doing like ounces you&rsquo;re gonna spike</p>
<p>insulin just because the fact that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating okay okay good I have</p>
<p>another one okay you have one more</p>
<p>question no social media we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>rule okay so there are a couple of</p>
<p>questions just on intermittent fasting</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking a lot about keto what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the difference do you do one without the</p>
<p>other</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s more important yeah talk about</p>
<p>that well briefly they&rsquo;re coming very</p>
<p>briefly in a minute or hour okay okay so</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing the intimate of fasting</p>
<p>will help you reduce insulin</p>
<p>significantly intimate fasting will</p>
<p>increase growth hormone by 2,000 percent</p>
<p>and what about aging that</p>
<p>fat burning okay okay anti-aging fat</p>
<p>burning if you want that you know if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want that then forget it so I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know yes so in termina fasting</p>
<p>will also increase testosterone okay for</p>
<p>me no well yeah but mainly for men so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very important thing now doing</p>
<p>keto will also drop your insulin down</p>
<p>that will help you so they&rsquo;re both kind</p>
<p>of similar in nature and so I would put</p>
<p>them on the same weight of importance</p>
<p>you just need to do them both okay now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna take a question from Linda</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s been on the phone for 22 minutes</p>
<p>then to go ahead you&rsquo;re from Indiana</p>
<p>thanks Warren thank you for all your</p>
<p>information you put out there</p>
<p>I accidentally come across the video of</p>
<p>yours and I ain&rsquo;t stopped since</p>
<p>but anyway I think you&rsquo;ve got the</p>
<p>healthiest version of keto I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>started yet but my question was I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>getting crepey skin I&rsquo;m not talking like</p>
<p>fine lines around the eyes or anything</p>
<p>like that but it&rsquo;s a crepey skin like</p>
<p>maybe certain maybe where the slab is</p>
<p>like say like under the arms but now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>starting to see it on my neck is there a</p>
<p>reason for that or what the keto help</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it is something to is collagen</p>
<p>right did you start the keto and mmm</p>
<p>fasting yet no no I want to get I&rsquo;m one</p>
<p>I like to learn everything for a jump in</p>
<p>and make no mistakes okay good are you</p>
<p>did you did you reading my book yeah yes</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got it I&rsquo;ve got your you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>and all that okay great so let me just</p>
<p>kind of give you a step by step from</p>
<p>really fast this is a really good</p>
<p>booklet to get started and then filled</p>
<p>in the details and I think you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>it right I mean you&rsquo;re just learning all</p>
<p>the details of how to do it but as soon</p>
<p>as you start it&rsquo;s gonna start making a</p>
<p>huge difference with your skin it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna help you unwrinkle your wrinkles</p>
<p>okay because that is all collagen you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need more collagen you need to do</p>
<p>the intermittent fasting and the keto</p>
<p>which will drop insulin now you&rsquo;ll start</p>
<p>absorbing amino acids and you&rsquo;ll start</p>
<p>having more elasticity more youthful</p>
<p>skin it will start tightening up there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another condition that is called etapa G</p>
<p>which is your cells we</p>
<p>cycling old damaged proteins so here you</p>
<p>have this amazing mechanism which goes</p>
<p>in there cleans up all the damaged old</p>
<p>proteins in your cells cleans it up now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re left with really good healthy</p>
<p>cells that show up in nice skin toner</p>
<p>skin less wrinkles plus the eating is</p>
<p>gonna be really good fat soluble</p>
<p>vitamins you can start absorbing those</p>
<p>so that will fully handle your problem</p>
<p>so I would maybe this weekend finish the</p>
<p>book and then jump right in and start</p>
<p>Monday because a good thing we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have any holidays coming up attempt you</p>
<p>thanks Linda so I want to take a</p>
<p>question from Christian he&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>California go ahead actor coverage oh</p>
<p>wow</p>
<p>still good to talk to you um first of I</p>
<p>wanna say thank you for all your videos</p>
<p>really changed my life that&rsquo;s good so</p>
<p>the first question is you know</p>
<p>electrolyte powder right I tend to</p>
<p>either like way too much I want to know</p>
<p>does it break my fast or not because I</p>
<p>have like one one scoop of serving like</p>
<p>almost every hour right and then like I</p>
<p>eat one one meal a day and I&rsquo;m easily</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult you know because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>so adapted but they&rsquo;re literally powder</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so into it so I want to know is it</p>
<p>okay for me to consume it as much as I</p>
<p>want and my second question is um so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>eating one one meal a day and so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to back out from this fad a</p>
<p>little bit you know because I was one of</p>
<p>the videos you said once we are death we</p>
<p>can back out from the facts yeah well if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing else to eat because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>having my I&rsquo;ve like 16 cups of</p>
<p>vegetables and then I have moderate</p>
<p>amount of protein boy what else is that</p>
<p>it give not a fat he don&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>yeah yeah you got to eat something right</p>
<p>so here&rsquo;s the thing you could try you</p>
<p>know maybe add some humus in there</p>
<p>almost would be good and you have to</p>
<p>replace with something so you have</p>
<p>vegetables you have protein and you have</p>
<p>fat so I would I would maybe add some</p>
<p>types of fats that normally come with</p>
<p>the protein itself so you can do like</p>
<p>nuts or maybe</p>
<p>if you want to do that brie cheese is</p>
<p>really good maybe when you have meats</p>
<p>have more of a hamburger if add a</p>
<p>hamburger versus a steak those are all</p>
<p>important things now as far as</p>
<p>electrolyte powder it has a thousand</p>
<p>milligrams of actual potassium per</p>
<p>serving size so you might want to stick</p>
<p>with maybe four to five as the maximum</p>
<p>and because you&rsquo;re getting it from the</p>
<p>vegetables but some people can do more</p>
<p>and not have a problem I would stick</p>
<p>with that if I were you</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not gonna be any danger but just</p>
<p>stick with that because that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>all you need but you&rsquo;re getting a lot of</p>
<p>minerals that are going in there and the</p>
<p>other thing that&rsquo;s not in there unless</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing well actually is a lot of</p>
<p>salt so because people normally get it</p>
<p>from the diet so as long as you have</p>
<p>enough salt and elect light powder I</p>
<p>think that will give you enough minerals</p>
<p>to help you with the hydration and</p>
<p>performance so I think you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>great so just make those small little</p>
<p>tweaks all right okay well let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>Karen for a quick question</p>
<p>yes why are my questions always quick</p>
<p>because I have the I have these callers</p>
<p>okay so Abdul here on Facebook he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>suffering with congestion rhinos it√≠s</p>
<p>all kinds of allergy problems for a long</p>
<p>time and he&rsquo;s basically been trying the</p>
<p>Med route but he wants to know what do</p>
<p>you have to say about that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really good video you have to check it</p>
<p>check it out it&rsquo;s called a sea so I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s called a salt nasal rinse</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a netipot procedure that you have</p>
<p>this little neti pot and you put sea</p>
<p>salt in there and it goes up into your</p>
<p>sinuses you put a little garlic oil in</p>
<p>there oregano oil it will clean out your</p>
<p>sinuses really nicely I have a it&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>youtube just check it out that&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>recommend and of course you want to cut</p>
<p>out the sugar because that breeds</p>
<p>microbes and also congestion so right it</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t isn&rsquo;t the liver really important</p>
<p>when it comes to allergies and</p>
<p>inflammation yeah in fact when you when</p>
<p>you do the keto in a minute fasting you</p>
<p>should have less and less allergies over</p>
<p>time especially the sinus because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>also finally able to absorb vitamin A</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re getting rid of insulin</p>
<p>resistance which actually helps heal the</p>
<p>inside of the membranes so yeah</p>
<p>definitely change your diet</p>
<p>yeah good so I&rsquo;m gonna give you one more</p>
<p>question see I wasn&rsquo;t I wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>completely prepared I had two lined up</p>
<p>okay somebody let&rsquo;s see um I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>this was first name is all I was</p>
<p>hesitating on but she&rsquo;s been on thyroid</p>
<p>meds and she&rsquo;s handling a thyroid issue</p>
<p>and she started keto is there any</p>
<p>specific recommendation for someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s handling a thyroid taking meds</p>
<p>with regard to keto well what&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>happen is your liver function is gonna</p>
<p>improve okay so then the need for</p>
<p>thyroid is gonna be less and less and</p>
<p>less because if you&rsquo;re taking thyroid</p>
<p>medication and it&rsquo;s getting better you</p>
<p>could end up with more sour homas than</p>
<p>you need and end up with a hyper thyroid</p>
<p>so just monitor that because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have better liver function and</p>
<p>take selenium and iodine from seek help</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I would recommend okay I get</p>
<p>more because this menu really fast</p>
<p>I know those questions come up about</p>
<p>five times what about coffee and cream</p>
<p>make sure it&rsquo;s a grass-fed cream organic</p>
<p>grass-fed cream not a problem with</p>
<p>coffee just make sure keep it at one cup</p>
<p>in the morning like a medium or small</p>
<p>cup because all that caffeine will</p>
<p>stimulate the adrenals and by the way</p>
<p>for those of you that are coffee</p>
<p>drinkers if you feel that little jittery</p>
<p>or this weird feeling after drink coffee</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re addicted to coffee you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing too much if you take the</p>
<p>nutritional yeast boy the report&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>getting back it just seems to take all</p>
<p>that out those symptoms out of the body</p>
<p>really fast this calms the nervous</p>
<p>system really fast because the natural B</p>
<p>once I want to go to Dan dan you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>Toronto you had a question about organic</p>
<p>coconut oil in coffee actually okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s correct well thanks dr. Burke I</p>
<p>just to give you before I ask you the</p>
<p>question I just let you know like back</p>
<p>in November 8th I was 203 pounds and now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a hundred and eighty six right yeah</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not a leg injury back in</p>
<p>September so I haven&rsquo;t been able do my</p>
<p>regular workouts so let&rsquo;s just by doing</p>
<p>stretches and yoga and doing the</p>
<p>internet fasting wow that&rsquo;s awesome so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible like I was trying to</p>
<p>weigh myself this morning</p>
<p>but that said wall doesn&rsquo;t matter cuz I</p>
<p>feel better now</p>
<p>you know like I feel better so but then</p>
<p>I looked at the scales are like wow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s you know pretty pretty amazing</p>
<p>stop your rock like your advice is</p>
<p>incredible you know I&rsquo;m trying to get</p>
<p>the word out to other people too yeah</p>
<p>anyway so my questions this dr. Berg</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re supplementing with extra</p>
<p>virgin coconut oil and the</p>
<p>recommendation is one tablespoon it has</p>
<p>no protein no carbohydrates mostly fats</p>
<p>does that break the fast so say if I if</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing like try to do one day I&rsquo;m one</p>
<p>meal a day right now does that break the</p>
<p>fast I put that in my I know you</p>
<p>kind of hinted about that when think</p>
<p>Lisa was asking that question right on</p>
<p>but does that break the fast in the</p>
<p>morning okay good let&rsquo;s talk about that</p>
<p>it depends here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s the data about</p>
<p>breaking the fast in eating foods now</p>
<p>fats are basically almost close to zero</p>
<p>as far as triggering insulin but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another trigger of insulin and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>the that basically every time you</p>
<p>stimulate the gastro or the stomach</p>
<p>hormone so if the stomach has to work in</p>
<p>any fashion with certain calories that</p>
<p>triggers insulin so it really depends on</p>
<p>the quantity of fat that you consume and</p>
<p>how bad your insulin resistance is a</p>
<p>healthier you are with insulin and the</p>
<p>more that it works you can get away with</p>
<p>a little more fat if you have major</p>
<p>insulin sensitivity just a little fat</p>
<p>like a teaspoon could spike your insulin</p>
<p>more than you would like overweight</p>
<p>people in general have a lot more</p>
<p>insulin than thinner people so the more</p>
<p>weight you lose the less insulin you</p>
<p>have to deal with so the easier it is so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like you have to get skinny</p>
<p>to really fix your insulin resistance so</p>
<p>I would play around with it and see how</p>
<p>you do you might be able to handle it</p>
<p>fine and if you find that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>plateauing and you want lose a little</p>
<p>bit more then cut it out so generally</p>
<p>speaking one teaspoon it&rsquo;s not heaping</p>
<p>will be totally fine with that coffee</p>
<p>all right</p>
<p>good we&rsquo;re going to go to Indiana talk</p>
<p>to Holly you had a question</p>
<p>yes hi dr. Berg hi I&rsquo;m just starting the</p>
<p>keto diet and I&rsquo;m getting</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading reading reading and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>getting a little confused I have my</p>
<p>micro on My Fitness Pal set at 5% carbs</p>
<p>20% protein 75 fat and you know I a lot</p>
<p>of people says that&rsquo;s not right</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m just trying to do this</p>
<p>right and my other question is like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about the intermittent</p>
<p>fasting when you drink keitel coffee in</p>
<p>the morning that breaks that back</p>
<p>correct good question very a tiny bit</p>
<p>especially if if you have a really bad</p>
<p>insulin problem it might break it a</p>
<p>little bit more but typically it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to be an issue so I wouldn&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>about it too much I have okay and</p>
<p>another thing liver spots yeah I just</p>
<p>seemed like the last six years I have</p>
<p>just been getting pelted with liver</p>
<p>spots believe it or not those should</p>
<p>improve as you do this now did you can</p>
<p>you see my screen right now yeah okay</p>
<p>you see this book I&rsquo;m holding up do you</p>
<p>have this you have this book no I think</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little bit behind okay</p>
<p>the reason I&rsquo;m recommending it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you can get through it in 45 minutes and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all pictures it&rsquo;s on Kindle it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called it&rsquo;s not lose weight to get</p>
<p>healthy it&rsquo;s good healthy lose weight</p>
<p>and then fill in the blanks with the</p>
<p>bigger book but there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>conflicting data out here and so I try</p>
<p>to simplify how to do this and I</p>
<p>actually show you really simply how to</p>
<p>do it so there&rsquo;s no confusion because</p>
<p>the problem is going to all these</p>
<p>different sources and getting</p>
<p>conflicting data I think you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be fine with the the ratios that you</p>
<p>said with your eating and then you just</p>
<p>need to go ahead and jump in I have a</p>
<p>recent video it&rsquo;s called in a minute</p>
<p>fasting keto and manifesting overview</p>
<p>and it gives you an overview of the</p>
<p>whole thing from start to finish and</p>
<p>then tomorrow I&rsquo;m gonna release a video</p>
<p>for intermittent fasting and keto for</p>
<p>procrastinators not that you&rsquo;re pressing</p>
<p>here but I want to make it really really</p>
<p>simple like six simple steps so everyone</p>
<p>can actually jump in and get started but</p>
<p>I would start with this little book</p>
<p>right here and get it on Kindle and you</p>
<p>can basically learn how to do this</p>
<p>like in 45 minutes okay okay yes like I</p>
<p>said it&rsquo;s just so confusing you know I</p>
<p>just</p>
<p>and another thing I have a question</p>
<p>about you know it says that vegetables</p>
<p>are curbs so if you&rsquo;re trying to keep</p>
<p>your carbs under 20 you know I I love</p>
<p>ballads I could I could live off a salad</p>
<p>so alright so Hollywood can I say</p>
<p>something okay then I have a lot of</p>
<p>other questions in this book we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>clarify that as well because again it</p>
<p>again not everyone agrees with a plan so</p>
<p>you have to stick with one person and</p>
<p>stick with that but the thing with the</p>
<p>carbohydrates it&rsquo;s true you want to keep</p>
<p>your carbohydrates low with this</p>
<p>exception you don&rsquo;t have to count</p>
<p>vegetable carbohydrates in fact you want</p>
<p>a lot of vegetable carbohydrates you</p>
<p>want between seven and ten cups of salad</p>
<p>a day so or vegetables so that would so</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t to worry about it I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about counting your additional carbs if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna do hummus or nuts whatever</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a little bit of carb in</p>
<p>there or berries then those are the</p>
<p>carbs that you count okay so hopefully</p>
<p>that clarified things but yeah thanks</p>
<p>Holly okay we&rsquo;re gonna go to Karen for a</p>
<p>quick question okay what about dry eye</p>
<p>yeah okay dry eyes I used to have that</p>
<p>so bad it was crazy</p>
<p>you know the combination of doing mass</p>
<p>amounts of coffee and low minerals and</p>
<p>also a gall bladder problem and a liver</p>
<p>problem I wasn&rsquo;t able to absorb the key</p>
<p>healthy fats that I needed to go help</p>
<p>and lubricate the eye</p>
<p>I was very low in vitamin A I really</p>
<p>think dry eye is a vitamin A deficiency</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not that you&rsquo;re not consuming</p>
<p>vitamin A it&rsquo;s because your gall bladder</p>
<p>and liver is not absorbing it and the</p>
<p>cells are insulin resistant and you it</p>
<p>takes really healthy insulin normal</p>
<p>insulin low insulin no insulin</p>
<p>resistance to be able to absorb vitamin</p>
<p>A so do the keto in a minute fasting</p>
<p>that will eventually help your eyes but</p>
<p>if you want to take about them and I do</p>
<p>not take it in a supplement form why</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all synthetic</p>
<p>you want to take it is a virgin cod</p>
<p>liver oil and cut out the sugar and then</p>
<p>your body will start to absorb it and</p>
<p>that will actually fix the dry eyes so</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re going to go to Veronica from</p>
<p>California you had a question about d3</p>
<p>and k2 yes dr. Berg hi I&rsquo;m so happy I</p>
<p>got a hold of you anyway dr. Berg it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>on the D in July my D was low okay so</p>
<p>then by that time I had already been</p>
<p>listening to your your YouTube so then I</p>
<p>started taking your regimen on that D</p>
<p>and I came so now I went this month for</p>
<p>some more blood work and my D is high</p>
<p>now so way high so I was wondering was I</p>
<p>supposed to stop at a certain time or</p>
<p>keep going on the D or what do I do now</p>
<p>stop it now and how many how much how</p>
<p>much d3 are you taking I was taking the</p>
<p>10,000 IU&rsquo;s okay and are you taking the</p>
<p>k2 as well and yeah and I was taking the</p>
<p>k2 right along with it</p>
<p>yeah what I would do uh-huh yeah here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I would do I would take the d3 in</p>
<p>k2 maybe every third day right now</p>
<p>because your body&rsquo;s finally has enough</p>
<p>and just realized you when they do a</p>
<p>blood test they&rsquo;re measuring in the</p>
<p>blood but sometimes you know you may</p>
<p>have have to build it up in the tissues</p>
<p>which take a lot longer so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>building up and driving it in there but</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re taking the k2 I think</p>
<p>gonna be totally fine but I would take</p>
<p>them every third day now and apparently</p>
<p>you have enough d3 but of course I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t worry about an excess if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking every third day and of course</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in California maybe you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>be able to get some Sun so maybe you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>need it like once a week that would be</p>
<p>the best source of vitamin d3 but then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have to take k2 thanks Veronica</p>
<p>okay we&rsquo;re gonna go to Karen okay so liz</p>
<p>has a question about carbs she said she</p>
<p>ate some cereal</p>
<p>one day and she found that she had a lot</p>
<p>of joint pain why would that be what</p>
<p>does joint pain have to do with carbs</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s gonna happen is you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna spike your sugars okay when</p>
<p>you do cereal and</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s gonna happen is you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>spike insulin and insulin causes</p>
<p>inflammation okay so you&rsquo;re gonna end up</p>
<p>with a stiffness arthritis or pain when</p>
<p>you do too many carbs so as you cut that</p>
<p>down all that should clear right up in</p>
<p>fact if you add in a minute fasting to</p>
<p>your Kido your the severity of our itis</p>
<p>goes right down so it&rsquo;s really good for</p>
<p>arthritis and any type of itis bursitis</p>
<p>tendinitis you name it all the addresses</p>
<p>gastritis colitis okay alright good so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go to Kara you&rsquo;re from Erie</p>
<p>Pennsylvania you had a question about</p>
<p>the gallbladder and pancreas</p>
<p>go ahead hi dr. Berg I was calling you</p>
<p>to get your advice I 39 years old I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never been sick just woke up one morning</p>
<p>with severe well I didn&rsquo;t know that gall</p>
<p>bladder at the time gall bladder</p>
<p>problems end up had my gallbladder</p>
<p>removed and I was in the emergency room</p>
<p>for about three weeks with severe</p>
<p>pancreatitis still had that to this day</p>
<p>then had a hysterectomy had my uterus</p>
<p>removed and still to this day I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>throwing up every single night I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>on the keto diet for about a month and</p>
<p>just found out also I have saibra</p>
<p>Hashimoto with a very large goiter</p>
<p>just out of nowhere I just started</p>
<p>having all these symptoms and all these</p>
<p>problems and since I&rsquo;ve been watching</p>
<p>your videos I have been a lot better</p>
<p>tonight like I said I&rsquo;ve been on a keto</p>
<p>diet for about a month lost 22 pounds</p>
<p>great if I die roid it has improved 50</p>
<p>percent with no medication just on the</p>
<p>keto diet alone that&rsquo;s Fanta</p>
<p>are you doing in a minute fasting yes I</p>
<p>am I&rsquo;m doing I&rsquo;m down to one meal now</p>
<p>but but last night I just a hamburger</p>
<p>with some sauteed peppers and onions and</p>
<p>was very sick over that okay last night</p>
<p>with that just don&rsquo;t know what my root</p>
<p>cause is crying like I said are you</p>
<p>doing my gallbladder formula</p>
<p>yes I just ordered that yesterday I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing the gallbladder the enzymes the</p>
<p>vinegar tablet John I take that before</p>
<p>okay let me just give you some quick</p>
<p>tips Cara here&rsquo;s what you want to do you</p>
<p>want to take the Gaul better formula</p>
<p>after you eat that&rsquo;s going to start kind</p>
<p>of giving you what you don&rsquo;t have right</p>
<p>now which is low bile the factor you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing once a day as far as your meal</p>
<p>which is fantastic it&rsquo;s going to give</p>
<p>your pancreas a chance to chill out and</p>
<p>heal I would watch my videos on the</p>
<p>acupressure to the digestive system it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually even in my membership site do I</p>
<p>go more in depth but if you start to do</p>
<p>massage on these different organs you</p>
<p>can actually help improve the</p>
<p>circulation because you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to help them with nutrition and foods</p>
<p>which is great but they could be</p>
<p>manipulated they can actually it&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of like a muscle if you have a tight</p>
<p>muscle you&rsquo;d massage it right you can do</p>
<p>the same thing with the organs and that</p>
<p>would actually speed things up</p>
<p>tremendously you&rsquo;ll be surprised it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of like like massage for your</p>
<p>organs it sounds strange but it really</p>
<p>really works the other thing you want to</p>
<p>make sure is you really want to beef up</p>
<p>your your vegetables now and your</p>
<p>potassium which is gonna it&rsquo;s more of</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to protect your pancreas and</p>
<p>yes now you have the you had these</p>
<p>organs removed you&rsquo;re just gonna have to</p>
<p>cope with that but I would put more</p>
<p>attention on your adrenals I would do</p>
<p>some acupressure on the adrenals that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I would do if I are you because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of like the last thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in stress know that if you</p>
<p>actually improve that you probably see a</p>
<p>lot of change okay let me just get a</p>
<p>quick call from Patricia has been online</p>
<p>for 22 minutes I want to answer her</p>
<p>question from Pennsylvania go ahead hi</p>
<p>hi I too would like to thank you for</p>
<p>your videos and I have a question about</p>
<p>carpal tunnel plus um I also while my</p>
<p>daughter has carpal tunnel then I have</p>
<p>been struggling with tremors since late</p>
<p>2001 it is when it first started it was</p>
<p>it was like um my hand would shake a</p>
<p>little bit and then it got to a point</p>
<p>where my head flipped in Sirk</p>
<p>and up and down and back and forth and</p>
<p>stuff and and I&rsquo;ve been seeing my</p>
<p>chiropractor but as long as I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>completely in I don&rsquo;t have the tremors</p>
<p>but if I let their pool or something and</p>
<p>I my spine goes out then I have trainers</p>
<p>what have you started the keto and</p>
<p>fasting yet I have off and on but start</p>
<p>for me to stay on because everybody in</p>
<p>my house other than me or eating the</p>
<p>American American diet are you saying</p>
<p>really good foods to resist yes my</p>
<p>wife&rsquo;s from Ellen coots town fair and ya</p>
<p>know Kutztown cuts to time yeah they</p>
<p>have some serious shoofly pie there and</p>
<p>other things so apple dumplings yeah let</p>
<p>me give you a couple funny take let me</p>
<p>give you some tips okay you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have to get cooperation from your family</p>
<p>to help you with this thing they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to agree now to put it in</p>
<p>your face</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s gonna be you really need to</p>
<p>do this especially for your nervous</p>
<p>system in the carpal tunnel which by the</p>
<p>way if it&rsquo;s only in one hand I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>give you a tip you can work on the</p>
<p>opposite the muscles on the opposite</p>
<p>side it&rsquo;ll get rid of carpal tunnel just</p>
<p>so fast vitamin b6 is good for carpal</p>
<p>tunnel but I would do it through</p>
<p>nutritional yeast and the tremors should</p>
<p>improve once you get into some serious</p>
<p>ketosis within a minute fasting in</p>
<p>Aikido you&rsquo;re gonna have to talk to your</p>
<p>family if they want to see you improve</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re gonna have to either go on</p>
<p>the program to support you or hide all</p>
<p>this food when they&rsquo;re eating because I</p>
<p>do know the situation it&rsquo;s definitely a</p>
<p>big problem but now that you have the</p>
<p>knowledge now it&rsquo;s just gonna have to</p>
<p>try to make it easy and then for your</p>
<p>for your nerves and the tremors you know</p>
<p>unless you want to keep going on the</p>
<p>chiropractor for the rest of your life I</p>
<p>would just really bite the bullet and</p>
<p>talk to your family yeah or or lead the</p>
<p>way and do the diet yeah regardless of</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>mm-hmm and get your improvements and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll inspire them that&rsquo;s right gotta</p>
<p>do it thanks Patricia now let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>Karen for a question yes so I have shri</p>
<p>harsh from india who can&rsquo;t get the</p>
<p>gallbladder formula right now so he</p>
<p>wants to know in his diet what can he</p>
<p>eat increase by oh well you can do beet</p>
<p>tops like the Leafs from the beets</p>
<p>okay the beet leaves it&rsquo;s very very high</p>
<p>in nutrients that are really good for</p>
<p>the gallbladder and also the other thing</p>
<p>that I would do would be dandelion</p>
<p>greens if you can find them is really</p>
<p>good for the gallbladder liver and then</p>
<p>lastly is kale so those are the things</p>
<p>that I would recommend to actually</p>
<p>really help your liver okay in the</p>
<p>gallbladder all right so now let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>nella you&rsquo;re from Texas go ahead you two</p>
<p>question yes hi dr. Burdick first of all</p>
<p>I want to thank you so much for all your</p>
<p>videos I&rsquo;ve had a tremendous success</p>
<p>listening to all of your advice so my</p>
<p>question is going to be I have lost I</p>
<p>think a huge amount of weight so now I</p>
<p>feel like I&rsquo;m struggling for the last I</p>
<p>want to say maybe probably less than ten</p>
<p>pounds so my question is what is your</p>
<p>opinion on calorie deficit or more than</p>
<p>anything what do you think of calories</p>
<p>in versus calories does does that counts</p>
<p>and a keto diet and then if you do</p>
<p>believe in calories in versus calories</p>
<p>out what is your opinion on BMR and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sure you know what that is and also just</p>
<p>one last question what is your opinion</p>
<p>on coffee I love coffee time for me to</p>
<p>give it up so just your opinion on it</p>
<p>please like if I can get organic coffee</p>
<p>drink it every day yes so you do one</p>
<p>into one small cup a day okay and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>good make sure you don&rsquo;t put sugar in</p>
<p>there with the coffee organic would be</p>
<p>the ideal situation now for the last</p>
<p>that my viewpoint on calories is that we</p>
<p>we boils down to this I&rsquo;ll show you in</p>
<p>my book on page six okay the definition</p>
<p>food that which is eaten to sustain life</p>
<p>provide energy and promote the growth</p>
<p>and repair of tissues comes from the</p>
<p>derivation which means nourishment so we</p>
<p>really don&rsquo;t need calories we need the</p>
<p>nourishment in the calories and that</p>
<p>would be the vitamins and minerals and</p>
<p>all these other things so we don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>calories so as far as calorie deficit</p>
<p>goes it really depends on what type of</p>
<p>calories that you&rsquo;re doing I I wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>focus on restricting calories what I</p>
<p>would focus on is restricting the</p>
<p>frequency of eating so that way we keep</p>
<p>the calories high enough to provide the</p>
<p>nutrients because it&rsquo;s if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>if you really kind of look at it and</p>
<p>confront it you&rsquo;re gonna have to you can</p>
<p>lower your calories increase your</p>
<p>nutrients if you want which is a good</p>
<p>idea but if you have a low quality food</p>
<p>you have to eat a lot of calories to get</p>
<p>those nutrients so it doesn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>so I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about calories just</p>
<p>start going to twice a day or two once</p>
<p>once a days for its eating and you can</p>
<p>have a huge meal and lose at last 10</p>
<p>pounds because the real secret to losing</p>
<p>weight and you talked about your basic</p>
<p>metabolic rate you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>improving that is reducing insulin</p>
<p>because if you don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re never going</p>
<p>to go plows that pass that plateau</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to hit a setpoint you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to bust through that the</p>
<p>couple things that will stimulate your</p>
<p>metabolism would be intense exercise of</p>
<p>lots of recovery and fixing insulin</p>
<p>resistance and one last point the best</p>
<p>way to measure your metabolism or</p>
<p>insulin would be your girth your waist</p>
<p>measurement okay not necessarily even a</p>
<p>like a body comp test I will measure the</p>
<p>waist that way you know that if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shrinking everything is improving</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s like the big biggest</p>
<p>indicator that you know things are</p>
<p>getting better I think that answered all</p>
<p>your questions or might have been wanted</p>
<p>to do that I miss but all right so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go to Karen</p>
<p>okay so we have Chi from Malaysia he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>student he&rsquo;s 19 and he says he has</p>
<p>severe eczema and he&rsquo;s been on some meds</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna start or suggesting</p>
<p>immunosuppressant he doesn&rsquo;t want to do</p>
<p>that and he wants to know what else he</p>
<p>can do</p>
<p>if you want to improve your skin there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a couple things that you want to do you</p>
<p>can have different issues with skin that</p>
<p>are it&rsquo;s like mole growing on the skin</p>
<p>in which case you want to take any one</p>
<p>of the number of things like grapefruit</p>
<p>seed extract oregano oil things like</p>
<p>that you can start taking that orally</p>
<p>through supplements really helps the</p>
<p>skin also getting enough of the vitamin</p>
<p>A is going to be important so that would</p>
<p>be all the healthy fats one of the best</p>
<p>healthy fats would be egg yolks okay a</p>
<p>lot of egg yolks and maybe some</p>
<p>grass-fed butter cod liver oil awesome</p>
<p>vitamin A but taking it to the next step</p>
<p>you want to take you want to take a look</p>
<p>at it in a minute fasting and see how</p>
<p>you can include that in your lifestyle</p>
<p>because when you eat and then you stop</p>
<p>eating for a period of 18 - 20 to 22</p>
<p>hours you go through a system where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re recycling all this the skin</p>
<p>tissue and cells and proteins and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna end up with a new layer of skin</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really really nice so as far as</p>
<p>skin goes in a minute fasting is the</p>
<p>best thing and that includes acne</p>
<p>because will cause acne and skin issues</p>
<p>is high levels of insulin that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>women that have polycystic ovarian</p>
<p>syndrome they get acne which is caused</p>
<p>from insulin resistance and high insulin</p>
<p>if they can just go on and a fasting</p>
<p>program and cut the sugar out man that</p>
<p>just completely clears up really nicely</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re gonna go to Robert from</p>
<p>Thailand go ahead Robert hello dr. Berg</p>
<p>thanks for taking the call last time I</p>
<p>talked to you I didn&rsquo;t have my my lab</p>
<p>reports but I have them here I just want</p>
<p>to ask you I&rsquo;m looking at my GFR score</p>
<p>which is 69 now it says that I have</p>
<p>kidney disease is that make sense to you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 65 years old and if there&rsquo;s a way to</p>
<p>improve the kidney to make it stronger I</p>
<p>like to do that okay so let&rsquo;s just talk</p>
<p>about go ahead go ahead</p>
<p>well I was just gonna take I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>good hair now listening to you I was</p>
<p>just gonna say like yeah yeah as far as</p>
<p>me</p>
<p>diagnosing a kidney disease I can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>that but I will give you some tips on</p>
<p>improving kidney function but go ahead</p>
<p>you had another question yeah the only</p>
<p>other concern I really have is that I</p>
<p>have some serious neuropathy in my feet</p>
<p>and in my legs and I&rsquo;m concerned that</p>
<p>the the circulation isn&rsquo;t that great so</p>
<p>what I am doing is I&rsquo;m taking Salter</p>
<p>twice a day organic sulfur which I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>told that can really heal the body with</p>
<p>a lot of different things and I was just</p>
<p>wondering what else can i Kelly do for</p>
<p>that great question Robert there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple things you can do the B</p>
<p>vitamins specifically b1 in the forum of</p>
<p>a fat side will be one and even though</p>
<p>this is synthetic I&rsquo;m okay with taking</p>
<p>it especially if you&rsquo;re trying to fix</p>
<p>the neuropathy it&rsquo;s called benfotiamine</p>
<p>and oat to mean write that down and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really good for peripheral</p>
<p>neuropathy is any type of nerve damage</p>
<p>especially is it if it&rsquo;s related to</p>
<p>blood sugar issues because the high</p>
<p>levels of insulin destroy the lining of</p>
<p>the sheath around the nervous system so</p>
<p>benfotiamine is what you&rsquo;re missing to</p>
<p>help heal that and also that B vitamin</p>
<p>will protect you from the damage from</p>
<p>high insulin and it&rsquo;s really good for</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s also good to actually support</p>
<p>the kidney if you&rsquo;re getting your</p>
<p>potassium from large quantities of</p>
<p>vegetables that&rsquo;s also protective to the</p>
<p>kidney now there&rsquo;s a concern with people</p>
<p>that kidney disease have too much</p>
<p>potassium but you can monitor that but I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s probably if you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>take potassium supplement but I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>people that have pretty serious kidney</p>
<p>issues start adding more salad and they</p>
<p>monitor with their doctor the amount of</p>
<p>potassium and it actually improves the</p>
<p>kidney function so I would go with that</p>
<p>and then add the in event of fasting in</p>
<p>there those things would be very</p>
<p>beneficial okay thanks Robert</p>
<p>all right now we&rsquo;re gonna go to Michael</p>
<p>from Missouri go ahead you had a</p>
<p>question the reason I&rsquo;m calling is</p>
<p>because my wife was put on acquire a</p>
<p>medication</p>
<p>and it was about two years ago in</p>
<p>response to her having some hair loss</p>
<p>and for two years now and she really</p>
<p>noticed no difference whatsoever the</p>
<p>hair kind of falls out then it suddenly</p>
<p>stops and it will be okay for a little</p>
<p>while he&rsquo;ll be slightly cool then it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>start again and so she&rsquo;s really not not</p>
<p>noticing any benefit and we&rsquo;ve seen on</p>
<p>one of your previous YouTube videos that</p>
<p>you said it could be a good idea to get</p>
<p>off and the sooner the better</p>
<p>so oh you want to ask me what the</p>
<p>strategy should be for coming off of the</p>
<p>thyroid medication should there be some</p>
<p>tests that are done all you do and then</p>
<p>after you do it I imagine it may be</p>
<p>possibly quite dangerous so we want to</p>
<p>just get you on that okay great all</p>
<p>right here&rsquo;s my opinion and again check</p>
<p>with your doctor before applying any of</p>
<p>this this is just my opinion I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>trying to diagnose you or tell you to</p>
<p>come off your medication what I would</p>
<p>suggest that you do if you&rsquo;re taking to</p>
<p>our medication you don&rsquo;t see change then</p>
<p>obviously there&rsquo;s something else going</p>
<p>on because if it really was a thyroid</p>
<p>problem that&rsquo;s causing all your issues</p>
<p>then you would feel better</p>
<p>your symptoms would improve everything</p>
<p>would go back to normal and so they keep</p>
<p>telling you to take it they don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>tell you why and you&rsquo;re here to keep</p>
<p>going and you&rsquo;re like okay what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on my hair still falling out most the</p>
<p>thyroid most thyroid conditions are</p>
<p>secondary to either a liver problem or</p>
<p>gallbladder problem because you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>converting to t4 to t3 and I have a</p>
<p>video on that or it could be high levels</p>
<p>of estrogen the other cause could be</p>
<p>autoimmune in which case usually it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>GMO soy product that&rsquo;s could be</p>
<p>triggering it some of the GMOs now cause</p>
<p>autoimmune of the thyroid Hashimoto&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>avoid soy oil okay in corn oil because</p>
<p>the chemicals in there but I would just</p>
<p>look at estrogen in gallbladder and see</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t improve that and get to the</p>
<p>real issue of why you have this this</p>
<p>problem okay Michael all right now we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go to Karen go ahead Karen okay</p>
<p>good well I want to remind everybody on</p>
<p>Facebook that no matter what you comment</p>
<p>in the comments section you will get an</p>
<p>invite to the keto course and on YouTube</p>
<p>what is it dr. Berg well there&rsquo;s a link</p>
<p>down below yeah click the link down</p>
<p>below and that&rsquo;s a really good point and</p>
<p>I just want to piggyback on that if you</p>
<p>guys are benefiting from any of this</p>
<p>information and really want to help</p>
<p>people</p>
<p>press share share to your friends and</p>
<p>family with your in Facebook or YouTube</p>
<p>definitely share this information</p>
<p>because the more people that learn I</p>
<p>mean you&rsquo;re hearing these great success</p>
<p>I mean they&rsquo;re just going to benefit in</p>
<p>the goal is to help people but I need</p>
<p>your help to help them and we it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>win-win situation</p>
<p>so now we&rsquo;re gonna go to Karen for that</p>
<p>question good and I&rsquo;m also gonna say a</p>
<p>lot of the questions are from brand new</p>
<p>people and they&rsquo;re asking where do I</p>
<p>start so so okay go ahead so let me just</p>
<p>answer that real quick because this is</p>
<p>the book that you should start with it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all pictures it&rsquo;s very very quick 40</p>
<p>minutes and then you can get this book</p>
<p>to fill in the details</p>
<p>I spent tens of thousands of hours</p>
<p>creating this book there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>great David actually I just completed</p>
<p>yesterday doing a seminar in every</p>
<p>chapter that was a lot of work I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>transcribe it I did a seminar on every</p>
<p>chapter okay so and then we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>make it available in a form of a seminar</p>
<p>and then um audio and that and I forced</p>
<p>me to actually read the book again I was</p>
<p>like I was kind of impressed I was like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of great stuff impressed</p>
<p>with yourself I was impressed because</p>
<p>and remind me how much work I put in</p>
<p>there so he&rsquo;s a hundred and fifty six</p>
<p>images I mean that took a lot of work</p>
<p>and so anyway it&rsquo;s a great book for</p>
<p>encyclopedia of data on keto</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and also the body</p>
<p>types but this is a good book comes with</p>
<p>a companion if you get on their website</p>
<p>they come together but read this get</p>
<p>started then fill in the details right</p>
<p>here there are videos online beginner</p>
<p>videos overviews that you can watch if</p>
<p>you go to the YouTube my YouTube which</p>
<p>color channel okay and you click</p>
<p>playlists okay then you&rsquo;ll be able to</p>
<p>see all the ones in Quito and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fasting I have them all right there so</p>
<p>you can just watch one after another and</p>
<p>get through it and yeah get started that</p>
<p>way mm-hmm does it answer that question</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s good a lot of basic</p>
<p>questions and all the informations on</p>
<p>the video that&rsquo;s good so then I have a</p>
<p>question about someone wanted to know</p>
<p>about achieving maximum etaf adji okay</p>
<p>first of all for the beginners etapa g</p>
<p>is a really amazing condition where your</p>
<p>is recycling old damaged proteins</p>
<p>dysfunctional proteins damage from</p>
<p>microbes yeast fungus mold Candida and</p>
<p>your body recycles that damage from</p>
<p>pesticides damage from chemicals in the</p>
<p>environment damage from estrogen</p>
<p>mimickers and then your body recycles</p>
<p>all these proteins it basically it takes</p>
<p>that all this junk and it puts it</p>
<p>through the recycler and pulls it out of</p>
<p>the cell and and actually we takes all</p>
<p>these little particles and rebuilds the</p>
<p>cells so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re putting</p>
<p>your body through a little healthy</p>
<p>stress called in a minute fasting and</p>
<p>then it goes right into the citta pudgy</p>
<p>and you actually make new cells and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great for the immune system it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>for your skin it&rsquo;s good for anti-aging</p>
<p>is good for inflammation okay other than</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not good for anything other</p>
<p>than doing it well that was fast yeah</p>
<p>all right on that note have a great</p>
<p>weekend guys and we will see you next</p>
<p>week all right thanks</p>
