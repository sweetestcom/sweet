Burke you&rsquo;d be surprised that</p><p>probably a great majority of your</p><p>listeners know what PCOS is or at least</p><p>have heard of it so every time I do a</p><p>talk including at your summit which was</p><p>a huge audience by the way I asked all</p><p>of those people how many of you people</p><p>have heard of PCOS and almost I would</p><p>say at least 80% and remember that a lot</p><p>of the talks that we do do a lot of our</p><p>audiences are our medical professionals</p><p>up that&rsquo;s not the case at the Hedo</p><p>summit so it&rsquo;s not just that medical</p><p>professionals know of PCOS unfortunately</p><p>it&rsquo;s very common it is the most common</p><p>reproductive endocrine and surn hormonal</p><p>concern of women in the reproductive</p><p>years the most common okay if statistics</p><p>say between 80 to maybe 30% of all young</p><p>women so pre menopausal women have PCOS</p><p>polycystic ovary syndrome it might be</p><p>more it might be less I don&rsquo;t know to be</p><p>totally honest</p><p>diagnostic criteria is the best way to</p><p>diagnose PCOS but this is how it&rsquo;s in</p><p>diagnosed so basically let&rsquo;s go through</p><p>that what are the three diagnostic</p><p>criteria so two out of the three and</p><p>you&rsquo;re diagnosed with PCOS even though</p><p>polycystic ovary syndrome is a syndrome</p><p>it&rsquo;s a diagnosis of exclusion okay</p><p>meaning you have to rule out other</p><p>underlying at other possible conditions</p><p>right so there&rsquo;s certain hormonal</p><p>conditions that can mimic PCOS but</p><p>they&rsquo;re not PCOS so doctors are trained</p><p>because it&rsquo;s such a common condition to</p><p>what they&rsquo;re supposed to be trained to</p><p>rule out other conditions and when it&rsquo;s</p><p>not any of those then if you have two</p><p>out of these three expressions so one is</p><p>clinical expressions not necessarily lab</p><p>not not necessarily lab with clinical</p><p>expressions of high male hormones so</p><p>with all those androgens or hyper and</p><p>drogyny a&ndash; so high levels of male</p><p>hormones and a woman and a lot of us</p><p>know what this looks like severe acne</p><p>hirsutism which is facial and body hair</p><p>grows and then male pattern baldness and</p><p>women right we&rsquo;re talking about women</p><p>and many there&rsquo;s actually many others</p><p>you could get very evening as a voice</p><p>you can get an enlarged enlarged</p><p>clitoris I mean this is it gets worse</p><p>and worse more of these free male</p><p>hormones you have going through your</p><p>body right clinical expression of high</p><p>male hormones because the lab</p><p>expressions are not best because</p><p>fluctuate throughout the day so it&rsquo;s</p><p>very hard to pinpoint but the clinical</p><p>expressions are very obvious nicely from</p><p>experience when I was in my 20s the</p><p>second thing is abnormal or irregular</p><p>period and/or ovulation right which is a</p><p>big concern we&rsquo;ll talk a little bit</p><p>about that and then the third is the</p><p>presence of these cysts that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s</p><p>called polycystic ovary syndrome the</p><p>presence of multiple cysts on the</p><p>ovaries on ultrasound so when the doctor</p><p>does an ultrasound</p><p>the technician does an ultrasound if you</p><p>have two out of these three and you&rsquo;ve</p><p>ruled out other conditions there&rsquo;s a</p><p>list of conditions then you&rsquo;re diagnosed</p><p>with PCOS please note that no we&rsquo;re here</p><p>did we talk about obesity so weight is</p><p>not a diagnostic criteria or some other</p><p>related conditions okay so that&rsquo;s what</p><p>PCOS is very common as I said maybe</p><p>eight to thirty percent of all women</p><p>maybe even more that&rsquo;s a lot crazy very</p><p>debilitating okay so what do I mean by</p><p>this</p><p>imagine being 20 years old and a cute</p><p>young girl or young lady and having</p><p>facial hair and acting right not not to</p><p>say all these other things but there&rsquo;s a</p><p>lot of that in itself can be devastating</p><p>I went I could say 15 there&rsquo;s obviously</p><p>younger women with PCOS you can get</p><p>diagnosed with PCOS after puberty</p><p>although although it&rsquo;s very difficult to</p><p>diagnose PCOS in puberty because or</p><p>around puberty and adolescence because a</p><p>lot of these expressions or symptoms</p><p>aren&rsquo;t mimic natural puberty right so</p><p>it&rsquo;s diagnosed therefore they&rsquo;re not</p><p>getting treated early enough probably</p><p>right right it&rsquo;s common it&rsquo;s</p><p>debilitating it&rsquo;s very serious and why</p><p>is it very serious because it&rsquo;s</p><p>associated with many serious concerns</p><p>and this is what I hope to talk a little</p><p>bit with you today so as dr. Fung would</p><p>say and does say in that book that you</p><p>have there</p><p>if PCOS was just about a little acne and</p><p>a few missed periods and that wouldn&rsquo;t</p><p>be so bad I think it&rsquo;s pretty bad if</p><p>even if thou were it but it&rsquo;s not so</p><p>maybe we can talk a little bit about</p><p>that yes so there&rsquo;s there are many</p><p>consequences of having this condition I</p><p>would spike gas you tell me if I&rsquo;m</p><p>correct or not but pregnancy if you&rsquo;re</p><p>pregnant you&rsquo;re trying to get pregnant</p><p>and you&rsquo;re not getting credit because</p><p>it&rsquo;s one of the symptoms is you&rsquo;re no</p><p>longer fertile and then you&rsquo;re taking so</p><p>you have this condition and then now</p><p>you&rsquo;re going to try to get pregnant</p><p>artificially or whatever</p><p>I mean what what are the consequences</p><p>well maybe you should probably talk</p><p>about what&rsquo;s really going on inside the</p><p>body that&rsquo;s causing this first just</p><p>thank you people a foundation yeah so</p><p>this is a great thing so that&rsquo;s what the</p><p>art book is about PCOS plan it&rsquo;s not a</p><p>doom and gloom and we&rsquo;re not here to</p><p>tell you okay this is the worst thing</p><p>ever and thirty percent of women have it</p><p>we&rsquo;re here to say that this is a</p><p>possibly preventable and reversible</p><p>condition that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here right</p><p>that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re so passionate about</p><p>this and why doctor fun who&rsquo;s a kidney</p><p>doctor like you said why is he writing</p><p>about PCOS the reason why he&rsquo;s writing</p><p>about PCOS is because he&rsquo;s written the</p><p>obesity code he&rsquo;s written the diabetes</p><p>code he&rsquo;s written the complete guide to</p><p>fasting and now we know about PCOS and</p><p>we know it&rsquo;s an insulin resistant</p><p>condition we know just like diabetes</p><p>just like obese it&rsquo;s not the diabetes</p><p>causes PCOS it&rsquo;s not that obesity causes</p><p>PCOS I was very in I weighed 97 pounds</p><p>when I was diagnosed PCOS I was always</p><p>very good I&rsquo;m still very thin and so</p><p>when I talk about this I find that this</p><p>is very important it is true that a lot</p><p>of women with PCOS have obesity a lot of</p><p>women with piece as well so it&rsquo;s like an</p><p>added thing and they have central</p><p>obesity in most cases I did right away</p><p>start to get the central Issa to even at</p><p>a very thin so meaning I had a higher</p><p>percentage of body fat even though I was</p><p>thin and I had fat around my organs okay</p><p>like why I expressed so many of these</p><p>things so quickly and so young I develop</p><p>diabetes right away I develop retention</p><p>right away so it&rsquo;s associated to all of</p><p>these conditions because it has the same</p><p>underlying problem which is high insulin</p><p>I for insulin emia which leads to</p><p>insulin resistance and again as dr. Fung</p><p>would say I&rsquo;m always gonna quote him as</p><p>he would say if the problem is high</p><p>insulin and the solution is to lower</p><p>insulin and we know how to do that and I</p><p>remember saying this at your summit</p><p>where I said to when I talked about PCOS</p><p>I said how many of you know about PCOS</p><p>and everyone was like this and I said</p><p>but what if I told you you all already</p><p>know how to solve it and they do because</p><p>all of the your audience knows and</p><p>follows your your diet</p><p>your keto diet the low-carb diet with</p><p>intermittent fasting because I know you</p><p>talked quite a bit about it so all</p><p>everybody listening to us already today</p><p>knows how to help people with PCOS</p><p>because a lot of people put up their</p><p>hand and they don&rsquo;t have PCOS they have</p><p>a daughter or a sister or a friend</p><p>it has eCos I get messages all the time</p><p>I&rsquo;m now getting messages dr. Berg from</p><p>friends whose daughters or stepdaughter</p><p>top PCOS already I&rsquo;m 42 Wow incredible</p><p>mm-hmm so when you when you do research</p><p>and the medica the you know you type in</p><p>PCOS and Google right the first two or</p><p>three pages you&rsquo;re going to get the same</p><p>old same old by just the same old</p><p>narrative where they&rsquo;re talking about</p><p>weathers one of this one of the</p><p>characteristics of PCOS is or</p><p>associations is they have high insulin</p><p>but they don&rsquo;t connect the cause to this</p><p>condition so their inability to locate</p><p>cause and effect so it&rsquo;s really I mean</p><p>insulin and insulin resistance for those</p><p>of you that are maybe possibly new</p><p>watching this or let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p><p>searching and they&rsquo;re trying to find a</p><p>solution high insulin is underneath a</p><p>lot of problems when you get it checked</p><p>they don&rsquo;t really check for high insulin</p><p>going to the doctor they&rsquo;ll check for</p><p>high glucose and that&rsquo;s the high insulin</p><p>is not going to show up through the I</p><p>mean in other words you&rsquo;ll have high</p><p>insulin actually takes many many years</p><p>to raise the blood sugar so it&rsquo;s kind of</p><p>brewing the oven builds up and then one</p><p>day oh I&rsquo;m a pre-diabetic so high</p><p>insulin is one of the first things that</p><p>actually occurs and the way to</p><p>understand this is just look at the</p><p>opposite okay what what what does the</p><p>diabetic what happens with diabetes what</p><p>happens when you have like with the</p><p>diabetic you want to actually lower</p><p>insulin and then you&rsquo;ll correct it so</p><p>you know it just like when you really</p><p>understand what happens with insulin and</p><p>how it affects men and women then it&rsquo;s</p><p>very very obvious but I think the</p><p>relationship between maybe you can</p><p>explain this why</p><p>do women have an increase of androgen</p><p>when they have high insulin what&rsquo;s that</p><p>connection I can explain that thank you</p><p>very much and I know that you like to</p><p>keep things simple and so do I so I</p><p>appreciate that but I did write a review</p><p>it&rsquo;s and I&rsquo;m so happy that you said when</p><p>you look at the scientific literature</p><p>because I did write a review called for</p><p>the Journal of insulin resistance so</p><p>it&rsquo;s a review so it&rsquo;s very easy to read</p><p>which I like it&rsquo;s most easy to write as</p><p>well</p><p>but it&rsquo;s called the contribution of</p><p>hyperinsulinemia the hyperandrogenism of</p><p>women with PCOS so basically how much</p><p>does high insulin contribute to the high</p><p>the expression of high male hormones and</p><p>women that&rsquo;s what the title means and</p><p>that&rsquo;s what so basically what we find we</p><p>found that the in fact scientific</p><p>literature does connect the high insulin</p><p>to the high male hormone so it&rsquo;s there</p><p>they know it but yet a treatment which</p><p>is what you were just saying a little</p><p>while ago the treatment doesn&rsquo;t focus on</p><p>the root cause at all so when a young</p><p>woman or an older woman women of all</p><p>ages really they show up to their</p><p>doctor&rsquo;s office if they get diagnosed</p><p>with PCOS they&rsquo;re told it&rsquo;s common and</p><p>they&rsquo;re often just old to go away</p><p>there&rsquo;s not much you can do about it or</p><p>they&rsquo;re given a million medications for</p><p>a million different expressions so it&rsquo;s</p><p>a symptomatic treatment as we know right</p><p>very well they&rsquo;re treated for if if they</p><p>have acne like I did they&rsquo;re either</p><p>given the pill if they&rsquo;re young enough</p><p>or they&rsquo;re given an acne treatment</p><p>another bill to treat acne if they have</p><p>diabetes which I did they were given by</p><p>these medications if they have</p><p>hypertension they&rsquo;re given hypertension</p><p>medication if they&rsquo;re trying to get</p><p>pregnant like you said they&rsquo;re put on</p><p>fertility drugs and then if they have a</p><p>little bit of depression and anxiety</p><p>around this condition they&rsquo;re put on</p><p>that as well and I could go on and on</p><p>and on and then if they are one of the</p><p>many women to develop cancer associated</p><p>with this I did I had thyroid cancer and</p><p>you got to go through that treatment and</p><p>then you drug but they have to take</p><p>forever and ever right so the treatment</p><p>even though we have connected the dot</p><p>and I can explain to you what what&rsquo;s</p><p>going on basically there are these cells</p><p>in the ovaries called Becca&rsquo;s house</p><p>that produce testosterone so more in the</p><p>and our ovaries their way in there in</p><p>our bodies this is basically diabetes of</p><p>do overs as they call it our ovaries</p><p>have all these insulin receptors and it</p><p>makes sense that they do if you look at</p><p>I&rsquo;m not gonna bore you but if you look</p><p>at all animals all animals have insulin</p><p>receptors in the ovaries it&rsquo;s a way for</p><p>the body to know inside if there&rsquo;s</p><p>enough nutrition out there for us to</p><p>make babies I guess it&rsquo;s a good sort of</p><p>conversation with the outside world</p><p>right the ovaries doesn&rsquo;t have eyes and</p><p>it&rsquo;s a way for the body to know if</p><p>there&rsquo;s enough nutrients to make babies</p><p>so there are a lot of insulin receptors</p><p>in the ovaries when you have too much</p><p>insulin it over produces testosterone</p><p>and you don&rsquo;t want that you and then the</p><p>insulin also has a major effect on our</p><p>liver we all know this but one other</p><p>thing that it does in the liver is it</p><p>reduces the production of another</p><p>molecule called sex hormone binding</p><p>globulin which is within a molecule that</p><p>binds his sex hormones so then again to</p><p>testosterone so it&rsquo;s a two-fold thing</p><p>not only are you over producing</p><p>testosterone in the ovaries but you&rsquo;re</p><p>under producing the molecule that&rsquo;s</p><p>going to bind to the testosterone and</p><p>make it inactive so now you have more</p><p>testosterone roaming around but you have</p><p>more active and free testosterone to go</p><p>around and do what you don&rsquo;t want it to</p><p>do all over your body so you don&rsquo;t want</p><p>it to go to your skin and your hair and</p><p>express itself as as it does in women</p><p>right if the male hormone expressing</p><p>itself in women and all of this is</p><p>because of the insulin this is in the</p><p>literature so if you want to have a look</p><p>at that if you like reading this kind of</p><p>stuff it&rsquo;s a review for the Journal of</p><p>insulin resistance well it&rsquo;s there but</p><p>the treatment doesn&rsquo;t focus on lowering</p><p>insulin it is devastating for a woman to</p><p>actually have lose their hair or the</p><p>facial hair they acne that I mean it&rsquo;s</p><p>it&rsquo;s a terrible thing when it&rsquo;s so easy</p><p>so when you understand the cause and</p><p>effect relationship now as far as things</p><p>that someone can do to lower insulin we</p><p>know lowering the carb low carb diet</p><p>will do it what are some other things</p><p>that people can do basically and this is</p><p>important right this is why words</p><p>much time talking about insulin because</p><p>mostly for like oh I don&rsquo;t want to hear</p><p>about that I just want to hear the</p><p>solution it&rsquo;s important that you</p><p>understand the root cause you important</p><p>I understand that would find a lower</p><p>insulin and that insulin is what&rsquo;s</p><p>causing all of these things in including</p><p>the obesity that might be associated</p><p>with it the central obesity like we</p><p>talked about it diabetes any infertility</p><p>and and possibly the cancers and</p><p>everything else but seems to dementia</p><p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s I mean I could go on and on</p><p>and I know you talk about all these</p><p>things so how do you lower insulin you</p><p>lower insulin in one of two ways you eat</p><p>less often because every time you eat no</p><p>matter what you eat you&rsquo;re going to</p><p>produce insulin it&rsquo;s important that we</p><p>drive this point home PCOS women do not</p><p>eat more so that eat less move more olds</p><p>calorie and calorie out theory is not</p><p>going to work and this is what&rsquo;s so</p><p>frustrating because most women are still</p><p>being told at their doctor&rsquo;s office you</p><p>have to you&rsquo;re overweight you have PCOS</p><p>you want to get pregnant or you want to</p><p>whatever</p><p>eat less move more they&rsquo;re not lazy and</p><p>they&rsquo;re not eating too much they&rsquo;re</p><p>eating too often they&rsquo;re eating too many</p><p>carbs eCos women have a lot of cravings</p><p>alike RB foods because their insulin is</p><p>high the higher your insulin this is</p><p>physiological there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with</p><p>up here I speak from experience my</p><p>entire life until I was in my 30s I</p><p>never ate a vegetable and I never ate a</p><p>piece of me I didn&rsquo;t like it I didn&rsquo;t</p><p>want it all I wanted was I have to</p><p>charge my before we shut off there you</p><p>go all I wanted Evert was carved it was</p><p>fruit bread pasta rice and any junk I</p><p>could get my hands on</p><p>lots of sodas lots of milk a lots of it</p><p>was just carbon carbon carbon carbon</p><p>carbon and I ate all the time why and I</p><p>see this in PCOS women all the time as I</p><p>had rebounding hypoglycemia and because</p><p>I was thin it was always the impression</p><p>that well she doesn&rsquo;t eat enough or she</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t you need more sugar and I</p><p>thought I - and because I kept Ethan I</p><p>didn&rsquo;t realize that all of that was</p><p>going into</p><p>my organs I just couldn&rsquo;t see it on the</p><p>outside so PCOS women even more often</p><p>and they graze a lot</p><p>they crave a lot so here&rsquo;s the concern</p><p>that I have so two things two ways to</p><p>lower insulin eat less often and eat</p><p>foods that are gonna create less of an</p><p>insulin response so higher healthy fats</p><p>appropriate amounts of protein and lower</p><p>carb so the ketogenic diet is perfect it</p><p>was perfect for me</p><p>that&rsquo;s the diet that I followed in my in</p><p>my journey okay</p><p>here&rsquo;s my concern he&rsquo;s your west woman</p><p>are smart too so what are they going to</p><p>do you&rsquo;re going to try to find</p><p>substitutes I can&rsquo;t have sugar I can&rsquo;t</p><p>have bread I can&rsquo;t whatever but they&rsquo;re</p><p>still craving the insulin is still high</p><p>when they start their journey</p><p>even if up here they&rsquo;re ready to go and</p><p>they have the information you&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>look for the substitutes they&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>look for the sweeteners they&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>look for the low carb breads and</p><p>everything else which is going to be an</p><p>issue because all of these things are</p><p>going to raise your insulin you have to</p><p>figure out how to eat in time restricted</p><p>eating windows you have to eat meals</p><p>that satiate you and you walk away you</p><p>need clean periods between meals this is</p><p>the most important thing in my opinion</p><p>so it&rsquo;s a combination of an appropriate</p><p>low carb diet with appropriate</p><p>intermittent fasting periods yeah I</p><p>think the secrets of this whole thing is</p><p>that just to let people know when you do</p><p>this your hunger your cravings go oh</p><p>wait and that makes it easy to do you&rsquo;re</p><p>not going to be struggling you&rsquo;re not</p><p>going to be like starving all the time</p><p>not at all</p><p>you&rsquo;d be totally satisfied because for</p><p>once you&rsquo;ll be able to burn you in fat</p><p>which is a whole new concept yes Wow</p><p>so this one thing that&rsquo;s I like about</p><p>this book here and I&rsquo;m going to put a</p><p>link down below I&rsquo;m not even sure if</p><p>it&rsquo;s available yet for people but I&rsquo;m</p><p>sure it will be soon but it&rsquo;s available</p><p>for pre-order and it comes out April 14</p><p>of 2020 okay

just</p><p>realize this is not difficult to solve</p><p>if you have the true information it&rsquo;s</p><p>right in here</p><p>it&rsquo;s just there&rsquo;s a lot of books out</p><p>there that talk about PCOS and they</p><p>explain all the characteristics but they</p><p>don&rsquo;t tell you what to do damn just</p><p>solution so this is like you know what</p><p>there is something that can work for you</p><p>yeah I know as I said earlier I started</p><p>off pretty</p><p>but our book is all about exactly that</p><p>what&rsquo;s the problem then here&rsquo;s the</p><p>solution it is a practical guide it has</p><p>a lot of good information a lot of good</p><p>science there that people just can&rsquo;t</p><p>refute I hope and as I said if you go</p><p>into the scientific literature it&rsquo;s</p><p>there before we wrote the book I did the</p><p>review the review supported the writing</p><p>of this book really and so then there&rsquo;s</p><p>a real good practical while I&rsquo;m very</p><p>proud of it I a practical guide because</p><p>it has recipes that has shopping list it</p><p>has all kinds of stuff so you probably</p><p>haven&rsquo;t gotten to that yet it&rsquo;s a very I</p><p>did say that and I was like wow they</p><p>have boy you guys just went all out and</p><p>just put everything in here this is</p><p>awesome because there isn&rsquo;t it I don&rsquo;t</p><p>know but there you know at least in my</p><p>research for four years really there</p><p>really isn&rsquo;t anything out there like</p><p>this specifically even though a lot of</p><p>people speak about PCOS in their</p><p>pictures I find a lot of doctors talk</p><p>about insulin resistance whenever they</p><p>have diagrams insulin insulin resistance</p><p>in the middle and they have little</p><p>bubbles going out there&rsquo;s a diabetes</p><p>obesity cos is always there fatty liver</p><p>or sleep apnea it&rsquo;s always there but I</p><p>don&rsquo;t know I guess I lived it right this</p><p>is like I had two children thanks to</p><p>reversing PCOS well maybe we get to talk</p><p>about what happens if you get pregnant</p><p>with PCOS and you don&rsquo;t reversal what</p><p>you thought we did about that okay yeah</p><p>it&rsquo;s very important and I will have to</p><p>do another one of these just on</p><p>pregnancy because oh my gosh this is</p><p>like that&rsquo;s the most important time to</p><p>make sure your health and your diet is</p><p>correct because that predicts the future</p><p>of that child&rsquo;s health it really does</p><p>you you better know what you&rsquo;re doing</p><p>are you going to be struggling with all</p><p>sorts of issues and so the child so we</p><p>we my daughter-in-law lives with us</p><p>and so she we made sure her diet was</p><p>really really clean so this child Lucy</p><p>came out like a super baby I mean just</p><p>incredibly healthy yeah she does get</p><p>sick of cage</p><p>but she&rsquo;s building up your immune system</p><p>she pops out of it like that but talk</p><p>about a healthy child so I&rsquo;m gonna be</p><p>doing more videos on that but I want to</p><p>thank you for your time and I think a</p><p>lot of people are gonna be helped I put</p><p>the link down below and the PCOS plant</p><p>awesome thank you so much you&rsquo;re welcome</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section
