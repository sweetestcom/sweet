    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re talking all about goals</p>
<p>and the science of goal setting and achieving your goals.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tremendous amount of information on the internet</p>
<p>and in books and so forth about how to set goals</p>
<p>and assess your progress towards goals</p>
<p>and update your goals and so forth.</p>
<p>In fact, there are so many programs out there</p>
<p>that include so many different acronyms</p>
<p>that it can be a little bit overwhelming.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s conversation about goals</p>
<p>is going to be quite a bit different.</p>
<p>Indeed, we are going to talk about setting goals.</p>
<p>We are also going to talk about</p>
<p>how to assess progress towards goals,</p>
<p>and we are going to talk about goal execution.</p>
<p>However, we&rsquo;re going to do all of this</p>
<p>in the context of neuroscience,</p>
<p>because it turns out that there are not hundreds or dozens</p>
<p>or even several neural circuits in your brain</p>
<p>that control goal setting and movement toward your goals.</p>
<p>There is one.</p>
<p>And while it includes many different brain areas,</p>
<p>that one circuit is the same circuit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s responsible for pursuing all goals.</p>
<p>And it relates to some very basic neurochemical mechanisms</p>
<p>that are understood.</p>
<p>So while there&rsquo;s a wealth of information out there</p>
<p>about goals and goal setting and goal achievement</p>
<p>and so forth, there&rsquo;s comparatively little information</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been available to the public</p>
<p>about the neuroscience of goal setting and goal achievement.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to focus on today.</p>
<p>I promise that we&rsquo;re going to get into the neuroscience.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to touch on a little bit of the psychology</p>
<p>and how the neuroscience relates to what&rsquo;s known</p>
<p>in the psychology literature.</p>
<p>And we are going to establish several,</p>
<p>in fact, four specific protocols that you can use</p>
<p>for goal setting, goal assessment, and goal execution</p>
<p>in an ongoing basis,</p>
<p>regardless of what your personal goals happen to be.</p>
<p>Before we dive into our conversation about goals</p>
<p>and goal setting and goal achievement,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to highlight some recent scientific findings</p>
<p>that I think are going to be interesting and actionable</p>
<p>for many of you out there.</p>
<p>In earlier podcasts, we talked about neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>which is the brain&rsquo;s ability to change</p>
<p>in response to experience.</p>
<p>In fact, neuroplasticity underlies all forms of learning,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s language learning or learning music</p>
<p>or math or a physical skill,</p>
<p>all forms of learning involve the reorganization</p>
<p>of connections in the nervous system,</p>
<p>the brain and spinal cord and body.</p>
<p>One of the key principles of neuroplasticity</p>
<p>is this notion of making errors as a good thing</p>
<p>toward neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit counterintuitive,</p>
<p>but what the scientific literature tells us</p>
<p>is that whenever we&rsquo;re trying to learn something new,</p>
<p>if we make an error, we know it feels frustrating,</p>
<p>but that state of frustration actually cues up</p>
<p>particular brain areas to be more alert</p>
<p>so that on subsequent attempts to learn that thing,</p>
<p>we have a heightened level of focus</p>
<p>and a higher probability of learning the new skill,</p>
<p>regardless of what that skill is.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked about this before in various episodes</p>
<p>as encouraging people to embrace errors or pursue errors,</p>
<p>not as their own end goal,</p>
<p>but errors as an entry point</p>
<p>for making the brain more plastic.</p>
<p>And if you think about it, it really makes sense.</p>
<p>Why would the brain change at all</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s performing everything perfectly?</p>
<p>When you make errors, well, in the immediate seconds</p>
<p>and minutes after those errors,</p>
<p>you are in a better position to learn.</p>
<p>A common question I get, however,</p>
<p>is what should be the rate of errors,</p>
<p>which is really just a way of saying</p>
<p>how hard should the given task be</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to learn or perform?</p>
<p>And it turns out there&rsquo;s an answer.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a recent paper that was published</p>
<p>in a great journal, Nature Communications.</p>
<p>This is a paper, a last author, Jonathan Cohen,</p>
<p>and the paper is entitled</p>
<p>The 85% Rule for Optimal Learning.</p>
<p>This paper we will make available</p>
<p>by a link in the show note captions.</p>
<p>But basically what this paper shows</p>
<p>is that when trying to learn something new,</p>
<p>you want to make the difficulty</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re trying to learn</p>
<p>such that you&rsquo;re getting things right about 85% of the time,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re making errors about 15% of the time.</p>
<p>And the reason I like this paper</p>
<p>is it really points specifically to some protocols</p>
<p>that we can implement because people always say,</p>
<p>okay, you want to set a high goal.</p>
<p>You want to try and achieve something that&rsquo;s really lofty,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t want to make the goal so lofty</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t make any progress at all.</p>
<p>Other people say you really want to start</p>
<p>with really small goals</p>
<p>and make things very, very incremental,</p>
<p>only set out to do things that you know you can accomplish,</p>
<p>and that will feed back on your self-esteem</p>
<p>and all these positive feedback loops.</p>
<p>And then, you know, layer by layer, layer by layer,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll eventually get where you want to go.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that neither is true.</p>
<p>You need to set the level of difficulty</p>
<p>such that you&rsquo;re making errors about 15% of the time.</p>
<p>And I want to emphasize about 15% of the time</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no way to configure protocols</p>
<p>for sport or language or math or anything else</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re going to have exactly 15% errors.</p>
<p>So anyway, this paper,</p>
<p>the 85% rule for optimal learning,</p>
<p>again, we will supply the link,</p>
<p>but it really points to the idea of making things</p>
<p>pretty hard, but not so hard</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re failing every attempt</p>
<p>or even half of the attempts.</p>
<p>Failing about 15% of the time seems optimal for learning.</p>
<p>Hopefully that information will be useful</p>
<p>to any of you that are trying to learn something.</p>
<p>Hopefully it will also be useful to those of you</p>
<p>that are teaching kids or other adults.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re teaching, keep in mind that you want to keep</p>
<p>the students reaching for higher and higher levels</p>
<p>of proficiency in whatever that is that you&rsquo;re teaching,</p>
<p>and that 15% of the time they should be failing.</p>
<p>If it gets to 20%, that&rsquo;s probably okay.</p>
<p>If they start failing about half the time,</p>
<p>then probably what they&rsquo;re trying to learn</p>
<p>is too difficult for them at that point.</p>
<p>Now, of course, this is going to be controlled</p>
<p>by all sorts of external factors,</p>
<p>like whether or not they slept well the night before,</p>
<p>whether or not you slept well the night before,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re being clear in your instructions to them, etc.</p>
<p>But I think the 15% rule, as we may call it,</p>
<p>is a good metric to aim for,</p>
<p>and it can serve both students and teachers.</p>
<p>In other words, it can serve both those teaching</p>
<p>and those that are learning.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to drinkelement, that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three minute quiz and Thesis will send you</p>
<p>four different formulas to try in your first month.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages that allow you</p>
<p>to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way that&rsquo;s really systematic</p>
<p>and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements.</p>
<p>And just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the science and in particular,</p>
<p>the biology and neuroscience of setting and achieving goals.</p>
<p>Setting and achieving goals is not a uniquely human endeavor.</p>
<p>Other animals set and attempt to achieve goals.</p>
<p>A honeybee attempts to collect honey</p>
<p>and bring it back to the hive.</p>
<p>A herbivore will go out and forage for plants</p>
<p>and will also have a need to reproduce</p>
<p>at some point in its life.</p>
<p>So it will need to find a mate</p>
<p>and maybe even raise the young,</p>
<p>depending on what species that is.</p>
<p>Predators will have to hunt and kill and eat their food,</p>
<p>and they have to avoid getting injured in that process.</p>
<p>They also have to raise young, et cetera.</p>
<p>So humans are among the other animals,</p>
<p>or we could say the animals are among us</p>
<p>in the need to set goals</p>
<p>and to make efforts to achieve those goals.</p>
<p>Now, why do I emphasize this commonality of process?</p>
<p>The reason I emphasize this commonality of process</p>
<p>is that it turns out that there is one basic system</p>
<p>by which all animals, including humans,</p>
<p>set and attempt to achieve goals.</p>
<p>Now, humans are unique in our ability</p>
<p>to orient our mind toward immediate goals,</p>
<p>moderately termed goals,</p>
<p>meaning things that might exist on the scale of a week</p>
<p>or a month or even a year,</p>
<p>and very long-term goals, like a lifetime goal</p>
<p>or a goal that lasts a decade</p>
<p>or it takes a decade to achieve.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes us unique.</p>
<p>And of course, we don&rsquo;t have access to the mindset</p>
<p>or the thinking or the emotions of other animals,</p>
<p>but what we do know is that common neural circuits,</p>
<p>meaning brain areas that are present in animal species</p>
<p>and in humans are responsible for orienting our thinking</p>
<p>and our action toward particular goals.</p>
<p>Another thing that&rsquo;s really unique about the human brain</p>
<p>is that we are able to have multiple goals</p>
<p>interacting at once.</p>
<p>So for instance, we probably all have fitness goals,</p>
<p>goals in relationships of different kinds,</p>
<p>friendships and romantic partnerships,</p>
<p>as well as maybe scholastic goals.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re in school,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re pursuing some kind of learning</p>
<p>outside of the school environment,</p>
<p>and or you have business goals or financial goals.</p>
<p>We are able to have multiple goals at once.</p>
<p>And other animals do this,</p>
<p>but humans are unique in the ability</p>
<p>to juggle a lot of goals.</p>
<p>And actually one of the major challenges in pursuing goals</p>
<p>is that goal pursuit often interacts,</p>
<p>meaning if you can spend 100% of your time</p>
<p>chasing one particular goal,</p>
<p>that might be very effective for that goal,</p>
<p>but then we tend to fall back on some of our other goals.</p>
<p>You can imagine how this plays out.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re working very, very hard,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re solely focused on business,</p>
<p>often your health will suffer.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re solely focused on your health,</p>
<p>often other things will suffer.</p>
<p>And so we have to juggle both our goal setting</p>
<p>and our goal pursuits.</p>
<p>And today we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>a number of different ways to work with</p>
<p>what could very well be called these interleaving goals</p>
<p>by focusing on a common practice</p>
<p>or common set of mechanisms</p>
<p>that are present in all aspects of goal seeking.</p>
<p>What is that process?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out it&rsquo;s a neural circuit.</p>
<p>A neural circuit is simply a collection of brain areas</p>
<p>that when active in a particular sequence,</p>
<p>give rise to a particular behavior or perception.</p>
<p>So for instance, when you feel happy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not because you have a brain area</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the happy brain area that is electrically active,</p>
<p>rather it&rsquo;s going to involve numerous brain areas</p>
<p>being active in concert and to different degrees.</p>
<p>In the same way that the keys on a piano</p>
<p>together played in the appropriate sequence</p>
<p>represent a particular song.</p>
<p>You would never say that one key on the piano</p>
<p>represents that song, but that key is necessary.</p>
<p>Similarly in the brain,</p>
<p>we can say that a brain area might be necessary,</p>
<p>but not sufficient to give us a particular experience</p>
<p>or generate a particular behavior.</p>
<p>So when we think about goal seeking</p>
<p>and the pursuit of goals of any kind in the brain,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the goal is.</p>
<p>It involves a common set of neural circuits.</p>
<p>And the neural circuit that I&rsquo;d like to orient us</p>
<p>toward today, and we will return to it a few times,</p>
<p>involves learning a couple of names,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have to worry so much about memorizing these.</p>
<p>Just more important is to understand the logic</p>
<p>of how it&rsquo;s put together.</p>
<p>And I will explain that and make it very clear.</p>
<p>If you want to learn the names, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>One of the brain areas is the so-called amygdala.</p>
<p>The amygdala is most often associated with fear.</p>
<p>So you might say, wow,</p>
<p>how is that involved in goal-directed behavior?</p>
<p>Well, a lot of our goal-directed behavior</p>
<p>is to avoid punishments,</p>
<p>including things like embarrassment</p>
<p>or financial ruin or things of that sort.</p>
<p>And so the amygdala and some sense of anxiety or fear</p>
<p>is actually built in to the circuits</p>
<p>that generate goal seeking</p>
<p>and our motivation to pursue goals.</p>
<p>The other areas are the so-called eventual striatum.</p>
<p>The striatum is part of what&rsquo;s called the basal ganglia.</p>
<p>The basal ganglia is a neural circuit</p>
<p>that can very simply be described as a neural circuit</p>
<p>that helps us generate go,</p>
<p>meaning the initiation of action and no-go,</p>
<p>the prevention of action type scenarios.</p>
<p>Let me make that even simpler.</p>
<p>The eventual striatum is part of this thing</p>
<p>called the basal ganglia.</p>
<p>The basal ganglia has sort of two circuits within it.</p>
<p>One circuit is involved in getting us to do things</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m going to get up tomorrow</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to run five miles first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m actually going to do that,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just using that as an example.</p>
<p>Another circuit within the basal ganglia is a no-go circuit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the one that says, no,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to go for the second cookie</p>
<p>or the third cookie.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to eat that.</p>
<p>And then the go circuit would be the one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s responsible for instead eating something else.</p>
<p>Okay, so we have go and no-go circuits</p>
<p>within the basal ganglia.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got amygdala.</p>
<p>So think of as kind of fear and anxiety and avoidance.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got the basal ganglia,</p>
<p>which are for initiating action and preventing action.</p>
<p>And then there is the so-called cortex.</p>
<p>The cortex is the outer shell of the brain.</p>
<p>And there are two sub-regions of the cortex</p>
<p>that are involved in goal-directed behavior.</p>
<p>One is the lateral prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>Prefrontal cortex is involved</p>
<p>in so-called executive function, things like planning,</p>
<p>thinking about things under different timescales.</p>
<p>So not just what we want in the immediate term,</p>
<p>but what we might want tomorrow or the next day</p>
<p>and how our actions currently</p>
<p>are going to relate to the future.</p>
<p>And the so-called orbitofrontal cortex.</p>
<p>Orbitofrontal cortex has a large number of functions,</p>
<p>but one of the key functions of the orbitofrontal cortex,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s involved in meshing some emotionality</p>
<p>with our current state of progress</p>
<p>and comparing that emotionality</p>
<p>to where it might be when we are closer to a goal, okay?</p>
<p>So there are basically four areas,</p>
<p>one involved in anxiety, one involved in emotion,</p>
<p>one involved in planning,</p>
<p>and another involved in this go-no-go action.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a bunch of detail,</p>
<p>but if I wanted to make it really simple for everyone,</p>
<p>I would say there are four areas.</p>
<p>One is an area associated with anxiety and fear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the amygdala.</p>
<p>The second is involved in action and inaction.</p>
<p>Remember, go and no-go.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the basal ganglia.</p>
<p>The other one is involved in planning and thinking</p>
<p>across different timescales.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s lateral prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>And then the fourth one is involved in emotionality,</p>
<p>where we sit emotionally at present</p>
<p>compared to where we think we will be emotionally</p>
<p>when we reach some particular goal,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the orbitofrontal cortex, okay?</p>
<p>Again, you don&rsquo;t need to know all those names.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to know all the details.</p>
<p>Just understand that those different elements are involved</p>
<p>in the decision-making processes</p>
<p>that lead us toward particular goals</p>
<p>and have us update our goal-seeking, et cetera.</p>
<p>One key thing is it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the goal is.</p>
<p>The same circuits are involved.</p>
<p>So whether or not you&rsquo;re trying to build a company</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a billion-dollar company that&rsquo;s going to go public,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re thinking about planning a crafts day at home</p>
<p>with the kids or for yourself,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re thinking about what movie to go see,</p>
<p>goal-seeking and assessing progress towards goals</p>
<p>all involve the exact same neural circuits.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really remarkable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also very convenient for our discussion today.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on in these circuits</p>
<p>can basically be boiled down to two particular things.</p>
<p>The first is value information,</p>
<p>trying to understand whether or not</p>
<p>something is really worth pursuing or not, okay?</p>
<p>So placing a value on a particular goal.</p>
<p>The other component of this neural circuit</p>
<p>is associated with action,</p>
<p>which actions to take and which actions not to take</p>
<p>given the value of a particular goal</p>
<p>in a given moment&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>I want to say that again.</p>
<p>The other component of the circuit is involved in action,</p>
<p>whether or not you should act or should not act</p>
<p>based on your assessment of the value of a goal</p>
<p>at a particular moment in time.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to hear me say over and over again</p>
<p>in this episode, the value information about a goal</p>
<p>is so key.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>There is basically one neurotransmitter</p>
<p>or rather neuromodulator system</p>
<p>that governs our goal setting,</p>
<p>goal assessment and goal pursuit.</p>
<p>And that is the neuromodulator dopamine.</p>
<p>Dopamine is the common currency</p>
<p>by which we assess our progress</p>
<p>toward particular things of particular value.</p>
<p>In fact, dopamine is the way that we assess value</p>
<p>of our pursuits.</p>
<p>And so as we take a moment and we shift our attention</p>
<p>to the psychology of goal setting,</p>
<p>the things that you&rsquo;ve probably heard a bit more about,</p>
<p>about what sorts of goals are good</p>
<p>and how to set goals and how to categorize goals,</p>
<p>I want you to think about how dopamine</p>
<p>could possibly be involved in these different processes.</p>
<p>And the reason I want you to do this</p>
<p>is that all of the psychology of goal setting</p>
<p>and goal pursuit is wonderful</p>
<p>because it places things into different categories.</p>
<p>It allows us to parse our thinking</p>
<p>and organize our thinking.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s not often seen,</p>
<p>in fact, I&rsquo;m not aware of any literature out there,</p>
<p>scientific or literature in the popular press</p>
<p>or in popular books,</p>
<p>is an understanding of how the underlying neurobiology</p>
<p>can be layered on top of the psychology of goal setting</p>
<p>to allow us to set and pursue our goals more effectively.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to do today.</p>
<p>We are eventually going to arrive</p>
<p>at a set of four practices</p>
<p>that when performed on a regular basis</p>
<p>will allow you to assess</p>
<p>what is the value of this next particular action step?</p>
<p>How worthwhile is it to do behavior A versus behavior B</p>
<p>in order to achieve a particular goal?</p>
<p>If any of this is vague now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to make it all very clear for you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to come away</p>
<p>with some very specific lists of takeaways</p>
<p>that you can put down on paper if you like,</p>
<p>and that you can use to set goals, assess goals,</p>
<p>and execute goals more effectively</p>
<p>using the neuroscience of the circuits I just described</p>
<p>and an understanding of the neuromodulator dopamine.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the psychology</p>
<p>of goal setting and goal pursuit.</p>
<p>This is an enormous literature,</p>
<p>meaning there are tens of thousands,</p>
<p>if not hundreds of thousands of scientific papers</p>
<p>about the topic of goal setting and goal pursuit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a lot of information on the internet</p>
<p>about goal pursuit.</p>
<p>And in looking over this information,</p>
<p>one comes to appreciate pretty quickly</p>
<p>that acronyms are a big thing.</p>
<p>Acronyms seem to dominate the area of goal setting,</p>
<p>especially as it relates to things in the business sector,</p>
<p>but also in the relationship sector.</p>
<p>Now, acronyms are wonderful.</p>
<p>They allow us to organize our thinking into lists</p>
<p>and conceptually they can be very useful.</p>
<p>But as I moved through this literature,</p>
<p>I started to see some redundant themes.</p>
<p>And so what I&rsquo;ve attempted to do</p>
<p>is distill out the redundant themes</p>
<p>that regardless of the person teaching</p>
<p>or the scientific laboratory</p>
<p>that happened to come up with these acronyms,</p>
<p>that they boil down to some common features.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about that literature.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;ll come away with an understanding</p>
<p>of some basic elements that are common to all goals.</p>
<p>Now, the modern science</p>
<p>or the modern psychological science</p>
<p>of trying to understand goal setting and pursuit</p>
<p>actually dates back to the 1930s.</p>
<p>And we have to be sure that members of our species</p>
<p>were focused on goal setting and goal pursuit</p>
<p>long before the scientific literature emerged.</p>
<p>It just stands to reason that</p>
<p>since the human brain hasn&rsquo;t evolved that much,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t think in the last 10,000 years</p>
<p>that people would be thinking about these things.</p>
<p>They just didn&rsquo;t get them down into papers</p>
<p>that we could evaluate on PubMed and so forth.</p>
<p>But now we can, so we can look at those papers.</p>
<p>And what you find is that acronyms abound</p>
<p>in the psychology literature</p>
<p>about goal setting and goal pursuit.</p>
<p>So for instance, you&rsquo;ll hear about the work of</p>
<p>Locke and Small, for instance,</p>
<p>these are the last names of various researchers,</p>
<p>the so-called ABC method,</p>
<p>that a goal should be achievable,</p>
<p>it should be believable,</p>
<p>and that the person be committed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of obvious once you hear about the ABC method.</p>
<p>Then people came along and expanded on that.</p>
<p>They talk about the so-called SMART method,</p>
<p>SMART being another acronym,</p>
<p>that it be specific,</p>
<p>that the goal be measurable,</p>
<p>that the goal be attainable,</p>
<p>that the goal be realistic,</p>
<p>and that it be time-bound,</p>
<p>meaning that you set up a certain period of time</p>
<p>in which a given goal should be performed.</p>
<p>And then people will come along and modify these.</p>
<p>This is the way that psychology research has done it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not laughing at it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just chuckling because it seems like the acronyms</p>
<p>get longer and longer and longer.</p>
<p>They developed the SMART-ER approach,</p>
<p>adding an ER to the acronym SMART, S-M-A-R-T-E-R.</p>
<p>They added ethical and rewarding,</p>
<p>which fortunately are good things, I believe,</p>
<p>ethical and rewarding.</p>
<p>What does all this mean?</p>
<p>Well, what it means is that any kind of goal pursuit,</p>
<p>any kind of goal setting really has to involve</p>
<p>a number of different states and neural circuits</p>
<p>in the brain and body.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s how I view this literature.</p>
<p>Why would I do that?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s think about the very modern version</p>
<p>of the kind of acronyms that I talked about a moment ago,</p>
<p>dating back to the 1930s and extending into the 1990s.</p>
<p>You can find beautiful talks online</p>
<p>from people who have worked with</p>
<p>some of the biggest companies</p>
<p>and greatest high performers out there</p>
<p>to achieve incredible things.</p>
<p>And they will talk about generating</p>
<p>a sort of objective mindset for goal setting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll talk about goals needing to be significant.</p>
<p>There has to be a big goal, that it has to be concrete.</p>
<p>So you have to be able to describe what the goal is.</p>
<p>It has to be action oriented.</p>
<p>It has to be inspirational, has to be time-bound.</p>
<p>You have to have reasonable, realistic, verifiable measures.</p>
<p>You have to constantly up the ante.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s starting to sound repetitive,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because it is repetitive.</p>
<p>There are basically only three or four elements</p>
<p>to goal setting and goal pursuit.</p>
<p>Basically, an individual or set of individuals</p>
<p>has to identify a specific thing</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to attain.</p>
<p>In some communities, they talk about</p>
<p>knowing what right looks like,</p>
<p>meaning being able to define a very specific goal.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just say, I want to be a champion athlete.</p>
<p>You have to say what sport,</p>
<p>and you have to understand what the path to that is.</p>
<p>So any big goal, of course,</p>
<p>is broken up into a series of smaller goals,</p>
<p>but the whole thing starts with thinking</p>
<p>about the end in mind.</p>
<p>And in a few minutes, we will talk about</p>
<p>whether or not visualization of the end in mind</p>
<p>is actually beneficial or detrimental to achieving goals.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually great neuroscience</p>
<p>and psychology data on that now.</p>
<p>So I mentioned all these acronyms,</p>
<p>not as an attempt to disparage them.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re wonderful.</p>
<p>And I mentioned all that psychology literature,</p>
<p>not in an attempt to disparage it,</p>
<p>but rather to just say that goal setting is the first step,</p>
<p>assessment of whether or not one is making progress</p>
<p>towards those goals is a second, but necessary step.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the business of goal execution.</p>
<p>And that brings us back to the neural circuit components.</p>
<p>Remember, this neural circuit involving</p>
<p>those four things earlier,</p>
<p>the amygdala, striatum, or frontal cortex,</p>
<p>and the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>they work together to divide the whole process,</p>
<p>as I mentioned before, into two general categories.</p>
<p>The first is assessing value,</p>
<p>knowing whether or not where one is at one given moment</p>
<p>relates to some external thing.</p>
<p>Are things going well or are things going poorly?</p>
<p>And knowing how to gauge that accurately.</p>
<p>And then action steps, goes and no-goes,</p>
<p>do more of this, do less of that,</p>
<p>do this, don&rsquo;t do that, et cetera.</p>
<p>So now we are going to shift back to the neuroscience</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to talk about the practical applications</p>
<p>of the information I just described,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve given you a lot of kind of</p>
<p>academic information.</p>
<p>And as we do this, I&rsquo;d like you to keep in mind,</p>
<p>what are some things that you&rsquo;ve either accomplished</p>
<p>or that you&rsquo;d like to accomplish going forward?</p>
<p>Because as we do this,</p>
<p>we can build toward a set of protocols that at the end,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to very quickly plug in</p>
<p>your particular goals and a route to those particular goals</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s grounded in the science,</p>
<p>and I think are going to be very effective</p>
<p>in allowing you to reach those goals more quickly</p>
<p>and with indeed less effort.</p>
<p>In fact, let&rsquo;s start with a tool now,</p>
<p>because as we move through all this information,</p>
<p>I want to make sure that people are coming away</p>
<p>with some practical things that they can implement</p>
<p>and indeed some things that you can even do</p>
<p>during the course of listening to or watching this podcast.</p>
<p>The first thing to do is to understand the difference</p>
<p>between peripersonal space and extra personal space.</p>
<p>Peripersonal space is all the space literally</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s within inside your body,</p>
<p>the surface of your skin and in your immediate environment.</p>
<p>Peripersonal space is a key concept in neuroscience</p>
<p>because you have particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and particular chemicals that are geared</p>
<p>toward what are called consumatory behaviors,</p>
<p>meaning using things and consuming things</p>
<p>and enjoying things that are in your immediate</p>
<p>peripersonal space.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example of this for myself</p>
<p>just to make it concrete.</p>
<p>You can imagine similar examples for yourself right now.</p>
<p>Within my current peripersonal space is my interoception,</p>
<p>my understanding or perception of my internal body.</p>
<p>So how quickly I&rsquo;m breathing, my heart rate,</p>
<p>the feelings on the surface of my skin, et cetera.</p>
<p>But also within the confines of my peripersonal space</p>
<p>is this coffee mug that if you&rsquo;re listening to this,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t see this, but I&rsquo;m lifting up a coffee mug.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take a sip of coffee.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a consumatory behavior.</p>
<p>I have the coffee.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to do much or motivate much to get it.</p>
<p>I have other things here, pens and computer, et cetera.</p>
<p>Okay, so things in your peripersonal space</p>
<p>and consuming those things is generally governed</p>
<p>by a set of neurochemicals that center around</p>
<p>the neuromodulator serotonin.</p>
<p>And there are a few others as well,</p>
<p>things like oxytocin, but mainly serotonin.</p>
<p>Contrast that with the so-called extra personal space.</p>
<p>Extra personal space is everything beyond the confines</p>
<p>of my reach.</p>
<p>It would be something in the next room.</p>
<p>It would be something down the street.</p>
<p>It would be something at some other location</p>
<p>in space and time.</p>
<p>And the neuromodulators and neurochemicals</p>
<p>that are associated with any kind of thinking</p>
<p>about anything in the extra personal space</p>
<p>are distinct from the neurochemicals and neuromodulators</p>
<p>that are involved in thinking about or making actions</p>
<p>towards the peripersonal space.</p>
<p>And the molecule that&rsquo;s most associated with thinking</p>
<p>about or orienting toward the extra personal space,</p>
<p>again, things beyond the confines of my skin or your skin</p>
<p>is dopamine.</p>
<p>And this is a vitally important concept to understand</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re setting goals and seeking goals.</p>
<p>If we are to be good at goal seeking,</p>
<p>if we are to be good at setting goals and assessing goals,</p>
<p>if we are to achieve our goals,</p>
<p>we have to be able to toggle back and forth</p>
<p>between a clear understanding of our peripersonal space,</p>
<p>what we have and how we feel in the immediate present</p>
<p>and our ability to understand what&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>in the extra personal space and our ability to move</p>
<p>into that extra personal space.</p>
<p>And a simple way to conceive of all this</p>
<p>is that we evaluate our progress in the peripersonal space.</p>
<p>We evaluate how we feel about some pursuit,</p>
<p>even if we haven&rsquo;t initiated that pursuit yet.</p>
<p>How we feel about a particular goal is truly a feeling</p>
<p>that we experience in the here and now,</p>
<p>even though the goal is in the future.</p>
<p>If we are going to evaluate whether or not</p>
<p>we made progress today or yesterday or not,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an evaluation of how we feel</p>
<p>in the immediate peripersonal space.</p>
<p>However, moving toward any goal</p>
<p>involves orienting our thinking</p>
<p>towards the extra personal space.</p>
<p>And as we go through today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to teach you a technique</p>
<p>or rather a neuroscience-based tool</p>
<p>that will allow you to continually transition back and forth</p>
<p>between the peripersonal space and the extra personal space</p>
<p>in a way that will allow you to update and evaluate</p>
<p>and better execute your goal seeking.</p>
<p>The whole principle behind this</p>
<p>is that human beings like other animals</p>
<p>have to make evaluations about whether or not</p>
<p>they are on the right track.</p>
<p>However, the important thing to understand</p>
<p>is that humans in particular</p>
<p>can do this over different timescales.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t just pursue food because we are hungry.</p>
<p>We pursue food, excuse me,</p>
<p>for a particular meal that we might be having</p>
<p>with people tomorrow, right?</p>
<p>We can modulate the timescale</p>
<p>in a way that other animals don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we adjust our goal seeking</p>
<p>to different timescales.</p>
<p>And in addition to that,</p>
<p>humans are exquisitely good at biasing our behavior</p>
<p>toward particular goals over very long periods of time.</p>
<p>But there are a lot of mistakes out there.</p>
<p>In fact, things that are outright wrong in the literature</p>
<p>and in particular in the internet</p>
<p>and in the kind of wellness and fitness</p>
<p>and cognitive fitness space</p>
<p>that send people down the wrong path.</p>
<p>And those things we will talk about in a few minutes,</p>
<p>but things like visualization,</p>
<p>that visualization and visualization of this big goal</p>
<p>is the best way to achieve your goals.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a much better approach to doing all this.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;d like to shift gears</p>
<p>towards talking about a few of the things</p>
<p>that most people get badly wrong</p>
<p>in setting and assessing and executing goals.</p>
<p>This is based on peer reviewed research.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s very solid.</p>
<p>I know it is very solid.</p>
<p>And it runs counter to what many of us have been taught.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a simple one.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard that multitasking is bad.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;ve heard multitasking is bad.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t allow for focus.</p>
<p>If you want to achieve anything,</p>
<p>you want to accomplish anything, you should not multitask.</p>
<p>Well, turns out that&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>Turns out that there is a role for multitasking,</p>
<p>but the multitasking has to be placed at a particular time</p>
<p>within your goal seeking behavior in order to be effective.</p>
<p>Really nice studies done at Carnegie Mellon University</p>
<p>and the Davish Lab evaluated how long people are able</p>
<p>to focus in different environments,</p>
<p>how long they were able to stay concentrated on their work.</p>
<p>And it turns out that number is exceedingly low.</p>
<p>Turns out that most people,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re doing computer work</p>
<p>or whether or not they&rsquo;re doing writing or accounting work</p>
<p>or anything of that sort can hold their attention</p>
<p>for about three minutes at a time</p>
<p>before they shift their attention off.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s ridiculously low when you first hear it,</p>
<p>but that probably reflects a basic state of brain function</p>
<p>that harkens back to a time when we were hunter-gatherers.</p>
<p>I doubt that we were maintaining focus solidly</p>
<p>for hours and hours and hours,</p>
<p>unless we were under some particular threat</p>
<p>or in some particular crisis.</p>
<p>Rather, you could imagine that people collected seeds</p>
<p>and nuts and berries for about three minutes</p>
<p>and then probably stood up, looked around</p>
<p>and then kept going, okay?</p>
<p>Or that they were hunting animals</p>
<p>or in some sort of pursuit, fishing, et cetera,</p>
<p>and focused, focused, focused.</p>
<p>Then every three minutes or so,</p>
<p>they might&rsquo;ve looked up and, you know,</p>
<p>taken a look at the sky or looked around</p>
<p>to make sure that other people were there</p>
<p>or not there, et cetera.</p>
<p>It all stands to reason that that would be the case.</p>
<p>Again, the neural circuits haven&rsquo;t evolved much.</p>
<p>Now, multitasking has been shown</p>
<p>to have a very interesting physiological signature.</p>
<p>When we multitask,</p>
<p>when we jump back and forth between things,</p>
<p>there is an increase in the level of the neurotransmitter,</p>
<p>also sometimes called a neuromodulator,</p>
<p>but basically same thing for sake of this discussion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an increase in the neurotransmitter epinephrine,</p>
<p>which is adrenaline.</p>
<p>And so there are really nice studies now</p>
<p>point to the fact that doing a bit of multitasking</p>
<p>prior to jumping into some focused goal-directed behavior,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s mental behavior or physical behavior,</p>
<p>it can actually be useful because it gets us into action.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve all been told that multitasking is terrible,</p>
<p>but if you, for instance,</p>
<p>find yourself cleaning up your house</p>
<p>and also checking your phone and doing a number of things</p>
<p>right at the point where you should be sitting down</p>
<p>to write or do some focused work,</p>
<p>it probably reflects some adaptive mechanism</p>
<p>where you use action and somewhat varied multitasking action</p>
<p>in order to generate adrenaline in your system</p>
<p>because adrenaline just gets you into action.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s great,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t want to multitask</p>
<p>throughout any kind of goal-seeking or goal-pursuit behavior</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s also very clear,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to talk about this in exquisite depth today,</p>
<p>is that visual focus,</p>
<p>and in particular, contracting your visual window,</p>
<p>bringing the aperture of what you see to a very fine point</p>
<p>can absolutely increase your clarity of goal-seeking</p>
<p>and the likelihood that you will pursue your goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this a little bit before on the podcast</p>
<p>as a way of increasing focus for any kind of pursuit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about a practice</p>
<p>whereby you can literally look at a dot or a line</p>
<p>placed on a wall or on your computer in front of you</p>
<p>for 30 to 60 seconds,</p>
<p>and then moving into some dedicated work</p>
<p>where you need to focus.</p>
<p>And indeed, just looking at a narrow piece</p>
<p>of the visual world, a small piece of the visual world</p>
<p>for some period of time</p>
<p>and forcing yourself to hold that gaze on that location</p>
<p>as best you can,</p>
<p>can increase your level of cognitive attention</p>
<p>and your ability to focus and stay focused.</p>
<p>And this is not magic.</p>
<p>It is the consequence of the fact</p>
<p>that most of your cognition follows your visual perception.</p>
<p>For those of you that are low vision or no vision,</p>
<p>meaning you&rsquo;re blind or you have trouble seeing,</p>
<p>my lab does a lot of work with people</p>
<p>who are low vision, no vision.</p>
<p>They tend to use their auditory system,</p>
<p>their hearing as a way to anchor their attention</p>
<p>to particular things, okay?</p>
<p>But most people out there can see and see pretty well.</p>
<p>And visual focus is the way to do that.</p>
<p>Now, earlier we were talking about this notion</p>
<p>of peripersonal space versus extra personal space.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just going to seed a little bit</p>
<p>of the later conversation by saying</p>
<p>that when we focus on an external point,</p>
<p>we are in a process of extra reception.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the focus on the extra personal space,</p>
<p>not the peripersonal space.</p>
<p>So when we focus on something,</p>
<p>say a line on the wall for 30 to 60 seconds</p>
<p>or at our computer for 30 to 60 seconds</p>
<p>and just look at it and then move into any kind of action,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s work action or physical action,</p>
<p>we are at its very core,</p>
<p>we are engaging in this pursuit of extra personal space.</p>
<p>We are placing our focus outside our body.</p>
<p>And therefore we are placing the brain</p>
<p>into goal pursuit mode.</p>
<p>Work at NYU, in particular in the laboratory</p>
<p>of a phenomenal researcher in their psychology department</p>
<p>by the name of Emily Belsetis, B-A-L-C-E-T-I-S,</p>
<p>Emily Belsetis has done really nice work on this.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve done is they&rsquo;ve had people</p>
<p>focus their visual attention</p>
<p>on a goal line of some sort,</p>
<p>and then to engage in some sort of behavior</p>
<p>that requires a lot of effort.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve done a lot of different experiments like this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just explain one.</p>
<p>They always include a control group</p>
<p>where people have to go through the same physical effort</p>
<p>or mental effort,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t focus their attention just on one location.</p>
<p>The long and short of these studies</p>
<p>is that when people have to focus their attention</p>
<p>on one location, like a goal line,</p>
<p>they are much more effective in reaching those goals</p>
<p>and they achieve them with the perception</p>
<p>that they expended less effort.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you an example of one particularly nice study</p>
<p>from the Belsetis lab.</p>
<p>So this particular study involves physical exercise.</p>
<p>Although, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve done similar studies</p>
<p>looking at cognitive type work.</p>
<p>And what they did is they had a group of people</p>
<p>exercise wearing 15 pound ankle weights,</p>
<p>and they had to basically move a certain distance</p>
<p>or run a certain distance to reach a goal line.</p>
<p>One group was focused on the goal line,</p>
<p>visually focused on the goal line.</p>
<p>The other group was not told</p>
<p>to visually focus on the goal line.</p>
<p>And what they found was that the group</p>
<p>that focused on the goal line</p>
<p>was able to achieve reaching that goal with 17% less effort.</p>
<p>They measured effort and it got there 23% quicker.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a remarkable difference, right?</p>
<p>So same distance traveled with same workload</p>
<p>because everyone&rsquo;s wearing the same 15 pound weights</p>
<p>on their ankles.</p>
<p>One group is simply looking at the goal line.</p>
<p>The other group is not told to look at the goal line.</p>
<p>Simply by looking at the goal line</p>
<p>does something to the psychology</p>
<p>and physiology of these people</p>
<p>that allows them to move forward with less perceived effort</p>
<p>and to do it more quickly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s remarkable, right?</p>
<p>And in this case, they&rsquo;re focused on the goal line,</p>
<p>but in a few moments,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about how one can use updating of goal line.</p>
<p>So incremental goal line,</p>
<p>starting with an intermediate goal</p>
<p>and then extending the goal line further and further.</p>
<p>But just sit back for a second and think about that.</p>
<p>Just by changing where a person looks,</p>
<p>they change their perceived effort</p>
<p>and their ability to do something more effectively,</p>
<p>more quickly than a group that is not deliberately focusing</p>
<p>their visual attention on one location.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so incredible in fact, you might say,</p>
<p>well, how could that possibly be?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out it has a very specific</p>
<p>underlying physiological reason.</p>
<p>And that has to do with changes</p>
<p>in our so-called autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>the aspects of our nervous system</p>
<p>that prepare us for readiness and action</p>
<p>or that prepare us for resting and relaxing.</p>
<p>So what is special about focusing one&rsquo;s visual attention</p>
<p>at a given location?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that we have two branches</p>
<p>of our visual system.</p>
<p>So visual information all comes in through our eyes,</p>
<p>but then it can head down two different pathways.</p>
<p>One pathway is engaged</p>
<p>when our vision is brought to a common point,</p>
<p>what we call a virgin&rsquo;s eye movement.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re focusing very intensely on a given point,</p>
<p>regardless of how far away from us that point is,</p>
<p>our visual system engages a certain set of neurons,</p>
<p>neural circuits that are involved in resolving fine detail</p>
<p>and that can evaluate small changes</p>
<p>over small periods of time.</p>
<p>Just think of it as a very detailed camera</p>
<p>of the visual world.</p>
<p>And it tends to be very restricted.</p>
<p>The other pathway through the visual system</p>
<p>is a so-called magnocellular pathway.</p>
<p>And this is a pathway that&rsquo;s involved</p>
<p>in taking in global information</p>
<p>about lots of things that are happening around us,</p>
<p>movement of things to our right,</p>
<p>movement of things to our left,</p>
<p>things that are happening down on the ground</p>
<p>and all around us.</p>
<p>And that pathway involves a sort of relaxation,</p>
<p>if you will, of the neural circuits</p>
<p>that are associated with alertness and attention.</p>
<p>When you walk down the street</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not thinking about much,</p>
<p>provided you&rsquo;re not looking at your phone,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not focusing on one location,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more or less in a relaxed state</p>
<p>compared to when you&rsquo;re looking for a particular sign,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking for a bus or a train that&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>or a particular person.</p>
<p>And that should inherently make sense.</p>
<p>When your level of attention and alertness goes up,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s sort of a small but perceptible increase</p>
<p>in your level of arousal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really stress necessarily,</p>
<p>but arousal of alertness.</p>
<p>And it turns out that the visual system</p>
<p>accomplishes this increase in alertness</p>
<p>by communicating with your circulatory system</p>
<p>and the system that delivers blood and nutrients</p>
<p>and oxygen to the rest of the tissues in your body.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk for a second</p>
<p>about what focusing our vision</p>
<p>on a particular location does.</p>
<p>Because in this study from the Balsettus Lab,</p>
<p>what they found was focusing on a goal line</p>
<p>allows people to move more effectively toward that goal.</p>
<p>This is something you can leverage in all aspects</p>
<p>of all goal pursuits.</p>
<p>What happens when we focus on a particular location?</p>
<p>Believe it or not,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an increase in a particular feature</p>
<p>of our blood pressure.</p>
<p>Now your body has, of course, arteries, veins,</p>
<p>and capillaries, and your heart pumps blood</p>
<p>first to the arteries,</p>
<p>and then to the other components of your vascular system.</p>
<p>And we have so-called blood pressure, right?</p>
<p>Blood pressure is just how much the fluid volume</p>
<p>is pressing on those arteries, veins, and capillaries, right?</p>
<p>So you can imagine a pipe</p>
<p>with very little fluid moving through it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s low pressure.</p>
<p>You have a pipe with a lot of fluid moving through it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s even more pressure.</p>
<p>You have a pipe with a lot of very viscous,</p>
<p>meaning very kind of sticky, thick stuff moving for it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s even more pressure.</p>
<p>We have blood pressure,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve probably had your blood pressure measured.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always two numbers, right?</p>
<p>You have a top number, which is the systolic blood pressure,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the bottom number below the line,</p>
<p>which is the diastolic pressure.</p>
<p>So the important thing to understand</p>
<p>is that your blood pressure will rise when your heart beats</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s more fluid moving through those pipes</p>
<p>that are your arteries, your veins, and your capillaries.</p>
<p>And that top number is called the systole,</p>
<p>or the systolic blood pressure,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the pressure</p>
<p>at the time when your heart contracts, okay?</p>
<p>So the top number, which normally,</p>
<p>if you have a healthy blood pressure,</p>
<p>is somewhere in the range of 90 to 120 millimeters</p>
<p>of mercury.</p>
<p>Millimeters of mercury</p>
<p>is just the way that pressure is measured.</p>
<p>That top number, your systole or your systolic blood pressure</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s measured when the heart contracts, okay?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the amount of pressure when there&rsquo;s a heartbeat</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s moving through your vasculature.</p>
<p>Now, between beats, right, the heart beats,</p>
<p>but then it relaxes,</p>
<p>your blood pressure&rsquo;s going to drop to a lower value, right?</p>
<p>Because fluid isn&rsquo;t being pumped through the system</p>
<p>at those moments.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the bottom value, the diastolic pressure.</p>
<p>And typically for healthy people,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be 60 to 80 millimeters of mercury.</p>
<p>So you might hear about a normal blood pressure</p>
<p>being about, again, this is an approximate, 120 over 80.</p>
<p>What that means is at the point where blood</p>
<p>was being pumped through your arteries and veins, boom,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s 120 millimeters of mercury.</p>
<p>But then when the heart relaxes for a second</p>
<p>before the next beat, then it drops to 80, okay?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s high pressure, low pressure,</p>
<p>high pressure, low pressure.</p>
<p>The fluid is being pumped through the system.</p>
<p>Now, why am I telling you all this?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that there are neural circuits</p>
<p>that link your visual system</p>
<p>and focusing on a particular point with that top number,</p>
<p>the systolic blood pressure.</p>
<p>And when you focus your eyes on a particular location,</p>
<p>that systolic blood pressure goes up.</p>
<p>And there are some other systems that are coordinated</p>
<p>with it in your brain and body</p>
<p>that start releasing adrenaline,</p>
<p>low amounts of adrenaline in most cases,</p>
<p>and that adrenaline further readies your body for action.</p>
<p>So bringing our visual focus to a particular location</p>
<p>does a number of things to the brain</p>
<p>and the whole system of the body to prepare it,</p>
<p>to place it into a state of readiness</p>
<p>that makes us more likely to lean into our goals,</p>
<p>into action.</p>
<p>And if we step back and think about this,</p>
<p>this makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>The brain and body need to be coordinated.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t just think about a goal.</p>
<p>In fact, a deer or a lion can&rsquo;t just think about a goal.</p>
<p>It has to think about a goal</p>
<p>and then has to feel some sort of activation energy,</p>
<p>some willingness or desire to move forward</p>
<p>in pursuit of that goal.</p>
<p>So imagining a goal has to be coupled</p>
<p>to the physical pursuit of the goal.</p>
<p>So our visual system in a beautiful way</p>
<p>brings together a focus,</p>
<p>literally a visual focus on a particular point outside us.</p>
<p>Then it recruits an increase in systolic blood pressure,</p>
<p>which creates a systemic,</p>
<p>a body-wide and brain-wide increase in fuel utilization,</p>
<p>in oxygen availability,</p>
<p>in our willingness to move forward as a body,</p>
<p>as a whole coherent system.</p>
<p>And then there are also neurotransmitter systems</p>
<p>like epinephrine, as we will soon see dopamine,</p>
<p>that get recruited as well</p>
<p>to place us into a continual mode of action.</p>
<p>This to me is a remarkable feature of our physiology.</p>
<p>And it gets right to the point</p>
<p>of some of the psychological phenomenon</p>
<p>that we were talking about earlier.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just recall what some of those are.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t list them all,</p>
<p>but a goal has to be significant, they say.</p>
<p>Okay, all the psychologists,</p>
<p>all the popular stuff online says it has to be significant,</p>
<p>has to be inspirational,</p>
<p>and it has to be action-oriented.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s say you look out</p>
<p>into the landscape of what&rsquo;s available to you,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s just in your mind</p>
<p>or you look at a specific point,</p>
<p>you say, ah, I want to go to that particular restaurant</p>
<p>to eat that particular food,</p>
<p>and you orient towards it and you move towards it.</p>
<p>This is the way that your brain and body</p>
<p>are coordinating their actions together.</p>
<p>Conversely, when our visual system</p>
<p>is in a mode of looking at everything,</p>
<p>when the aperture of our visual system is very broad,</p>
<p>we know that there&rsquo;s also a reduction</p>
<p>in our goal-directed behavior</p>
<p>and a reduction in the systolic blood pressure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if our peripersonal space is sufficient.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to get beyond our current state.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not oriented toward any one thing in particular.</p>
<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;ve now described some of the psychology</p>
<p>and some of the underlying physiology.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to mesh this within the context</p>
<p>of actual specific goal setting and goal pursuit,</p>
<p>because what many of you are probably thinking is,</p>
<p>okay, well, that&rsquo;s some physiology, there&rsquo;s some psychology,</p>
<p>but how do you actually apply this</p>
<p>towards setting and achieving goals?</p>
<p>Well, you do that by understanding</p>
<p>that your mental frame and your attention</p>
<p>are always either positioned to your peripersonal space,</p>
<p>focused on your immediate possessions and state,</p>
<p>or towards things outside you,</p>
<p>but that you also have the ability</p>
<p>to dynamically travel back and forth between those.</p>
<p>And so next, we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>what the literature says about things like visualization,</p>
<p>immediate and intermediate goals,</p>
<p>long-term goals, and how to best achieve those.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re going to move specifically</p>
<p>into the protocols that you can use.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a protocol that I&rsquo;ve specifically developed</p>
<p>for you, the listeners,</p>
<p>in order to incorporate all the signs into a best practice</p>
<p>that you can do anytime, any place,</p>
<p>to really identify what it is specifically</p>
<p>that you want to pursue,</p>
<p>and the best route to pursue and achieve that goal.</p>
<p>Focusing our visual attention on one particular point</p>
<p>is incredibly effective for all types of goal pursuit.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;d like to read some of the scientific studies</p>
<p>or read a review of the scientific studies</p>
<p>that have looked at how narrowing one&rsquo;s visual attention</p>
<p>can really enhance the effectiveness of pursuing goals,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put a link to this study.</p>
<p>The title of the study is Keeping the Goal in Sight,</p>
<p>Testing the Influence of Narrowed Visual Attention</p>
<p>on Physical Activity.</p>
<p>And this is a paper from Emily Balsetis&rsquo;s lab.</p>
<p>Focuses mainly on physical activities,</p>
<p>but it mentioned some other things as well.</p>
<p>This is an article published</p>
<p>in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin in 2020.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s recent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an exceptional paper, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Really gets to the heart of how all this works</p>
<p>and some examples of where it&rsquo;s been implemented.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s apply this visual tool in a very simple way</p>
<p>to any type of goal that you want to pursue.</p>
<p>If you already know what goal you want to pursue,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s a workout,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s a cognitive work of some particular sort.</p>
<p>Again, the process is very simple.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to focus your visual attention on one point</p>
<p>beyond your peripersonal space.</p>
<p>So it could be on your computer.</p>
<p>It could be on the wall.</p>
<p>It could be a horizon.</p>
<p>It could be at a distance.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to focus your visual attention there.</p>
<p>And with some effort,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to hold your visual attention</p>
<p>for 30 to 60 seconds.</p>
<p>You might blink, that&rsquo;s okay,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re going to try and hold your visual attention there.</p>
<p>So no moving your head around,</p>
<p>no diverting your attention to other locations.</p>
<p>Some people will find it very easy to do.</p>
<p>Other people will find it quite hard.</p>
<p>Your mind may drift cognitively, that&rsquo;s okay,</p>
<p>but try and bring your visual attention</p>
<p>to that common point.</p>
<p>Several episodes ago,</p>
<p>I talked about how there are actually studies</p>
<p>looking at developing this kind of training</p>
<p>in students for ADHD.</p>
<p>And the data on that are actually quite encouraging.</p>
<p>So for people who have ADHD and focus issues</p>
<p>and attentional issues, this can be effective.</p>
<p>For people who don&rsquo;t, this can also be effective.</p>
<p>Again, it places your brain and body</p>
<p>into a state of readiness.</p>
<p>And then the idea is to move into the particular actions</p>
<p>that bring you closer to your goal.</p>
<p>Okay, we haven&rsquo;t yet talked about how to set goals</p>
<p>and how to assess progress.</p>
<p>This is simply how to pursue goals, okay?</p>
<p>But the visual component is important.</p>
<p>In fact, I would argue that the visual system</p>
<p>and harnessing your visual attention to a narrow point</p>
<p>is going to be the most effective way</p>
<p>to get your brain and body into a mode of action</p>
<p>to pursue whatever goal it is you&rsquo;re trying to pursue.</p>
<p>That practice is in stark contrast to multitasking</p>
<p>where by definition, your attention is moving</p>
<p>from place to place to place, right?</p>
<p>I mentioned that multitasking can be effective</p>
<p>in getting your system into somewhat</p>
<p>of an increased level of activation</p>
<p>so that you can pursue a more focused goal.</p>
<p>But the visual attention to a particular point</p>
<p>is going to be the most effective way</p>
<p>to bring your system into a state of readiness</p>
<p>and action for goal pursuit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another really interesting way</p>
<p>that you can leverage your visual system</p>
<p>toward long-term goals.</p>
<p>The Balsettus Lab has also done</p>
<p>some really interesting experiments</p>
<p>looking at people&rsquo;s ability to set</p>
<p>and stick to long-term goals.</p>
<p>And the long-term goal that they looked at</p>
<p>was one related to saving money for later in life.</p>
<p>This is something that a lot of people struggle with.</p>
<p>A lot of people have a hard time investing money</p>
<p>or saving money for later in life</p>
<p>simply because as human beings,</p>
<p>we vary in the extent to which we worry</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going to happen later.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a phenomenon of so-called delayed discounting.</p>
<p>Delayed discounting is the fact</p>
<p>that goals become less rewarding</p>
<p>when they exist further out in the future.</p>
<p>Okay, you may have experienced this</p>
<p>walking past a donut shop.</p>
<p>I love donuts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to admit it over and over again on this pod.</p>
<p>I love the smell of them.</p>
<p>I love the taste of them.</p>
<p>I try to eat them because I&rsquo;m told</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not that good for me.</p>
<p>And indeed, I don&rsquo;t think they are.</p>
<p>I occasionally cave and I eat one or many.</p>
<p>But in general, I try not to cave</p>
<p>to the immediately rewarding properties</p>
<p>of the smell and the taste of the donut.</p>
<p>But what we know is that if you smell a donut</p>
<p>or you smell a wonderful piece of food,</p>
<p>in the immediate term, it brings your level of focus,</p>
<p>your mental focus to the immediate phase.</p>
<p>And it feels very rewarding.</p>
<p>Like if you had it now, it would just be so good.</p>
<p>But if you actually extend that reward out to tomorrow</p>
<p>or the next thing you think,</p>
<p>oh, you know, today happens to be a Saturday</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re recording, but oh, you know,</p>
<p>on Tuesday morning, I&rsquo;m going to get a donut.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have the same value</p>
<p>because the reward system doesn&rsquo;t work as well</p>
<p>for long-term goals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as salient.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as tangible a goal,</p>
<p>especially for something like a donut.</p>
<p>Whereas the kinds of goals that work</p>
<p>when you place them out into the longer term</p>
<p>and can create a heightened sense of motivation</p>
<p>tend to be things that are much more rewarding to us.</p>
<p>So delayed discounting simply says</p>
<p>that the further out in time that a given goal is,</p>
<p>the less effective that reward will be</p>
<p>in motivating one&rsquo;s behavior.</p>
<p>And indeed, you see this with saving money for retirement.</p>
<p>You see this with all sorts of long-term investment.</p>
<p>The Balsetis Lab therefore did an experiment</p>
<p>where they looked at people&rsquo;s tendency</p>
<p>to save money for later in life.</p>
<p>But the groups that they created in this study</p>
<p>were really interesting.</p>
<p>They had one group imagine what it would be like</p>
<p>to be 30 or 40 years older</p>
<p>and then to invest a certain amount of money</p>
<p>according to whatever it is</p>
<p>they thought that they would need.</p>
<p>And they measured the amount that they had set aside</p>
<p>and saved for later in life.</p>
<p>The other group actually viewed photos of themselves.</p>
<p>So picture images of themselves</p>
<p>that were artificially digitally aged</p>
<p>so that they could see themselves</p>
<p>30 or 40 years into the future.</p>
<p>And it turns out that people in that second group</p>
<p>simply by perceiving their own image</p>
<p>in the future invested far more money into later life.</p>
<p>They set aside more money.</p>
<p>Somehow it bridged the gap</p>
<p>between their immediate experience of life</p>
<p>and the longer arc toward what it was going to be like</p>
<p>in 30 or 40 years.</p>
<p>So very powerful result in my opinion,</p>
<p>because what it says again</p>
<p>is that our visual perception of the future</p>
<p>or our visual perception of the present</p>
<p>is what allows us to anchor our goal-directed systems</p>
<p>and our motivation to take on things</p>
<p>that in the immediate term might not seem that useful.</p>
<p>So you can imagine all sorts of variations on this.</p>
<p>You can imagine that every time I want a donut,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d see a vision of myself</p>
<p>or an actual physical picture of myself</p>
<p>as a consequence of having eaten many donuts every day</p>
<p>for the next 10 years.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that image would look like</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve never seen it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an experiment that I necessarily need to do</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not that motivated to eat donuts.</p>
<p>But I have to confess,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m somebody who I think I&rsquo;m pretty good</p>
<p>at managing resources.</p>
<p>But I think if I were to see an image of myself</p>
<p>at 70 or 75,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many things that are associated</p>
<p>with visual images, like what our body must feel like,</p>
<p>what our needs are probably going to be like</p>
<p>in that state or in that age,</p>
<p>what sorts of things we may or may not</p>
<p>still be able to do at that age.</p>
<p>And that anchors back to immediate goal-directed behaviors,</p>
<p>such as setting aside money for retirement,</p>
<p>such as investing in one&rsquo;s health practices.</p>
<p>And indeed, there&rsquo;s a study that has looked at</p>
<p>how people will invest in exercise and healthy eating</p>
<p>if they just think about the future</p>
<p>and what they might be like in the future</p>
<p>versus seeing images of themselves in the future</p>
<p>if they were to go down a healthy or unhealthy route.</p>
<p>So again, the point is that the visual system,</p>
<p>what we see is principally important</p>
<p>in defining what we do in the immediate term,</p>
<p>even if what we see relates to something</p>
<p>in the far off distance.</p>
<p>I think these are phenomenal studies</p>
<p>and they get right down to an important issue</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been kicked around over and over in the literature</p>
<p>and in the discussion about goal-seeking,</p>
<p>which is visualization.</p>
<p>We hear keep the big goal in mind, focus on the big goal.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re going to address</p>
<p>what does the science say about visualizing big goals?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s interested in business,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re focused on relationship,</p>
<p>is thinking about the perfect relationship</p>
<p>and what that would look like</p>
<p>and the family that you would have and where you would live,</p>
<p>is that effective in generating the kinds of behaviors</p>
<p>that will lead you to that?</p>
<p>Is it effective to think about the big win at the end?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out it is,</p>
<p>but you have to be very, very careful with when</p>
<p>and how you implement that visualization.</p>
<p>Because if you do it correctly,</p>
<p>it can really serve your goal-seeking well.</p>
<p>And if you do it incorrectly,</p>
<p>it can undermine the entire process.</p>
<p>So does visualization work?</p>
<p>Well, turns out that visualization of the big win,</p>
<p>the end goal, so the Superbowl win,</p>
<p>or eight gold medals in the Olympics,</p>
<p>or graduation from the university of your choice,</p>
<p>or making a certain amount of money,</p>
<p>or finding the partner of your choice, et cetera.</p>
<p>That visualization is effective</p>
<p>in getting the goal pursuit process started,</p>
<p>but it actually is a pretty lousy</p>
<p>and maybe even counterproductive way</p>
<p>of maintaining pursuit of that goal.</p>
<p>Meaning continuing to engage the sort of actions</p>
<p>that are going to get you to eventually achieve that goal.</p>
<p>I think this is going to be surprising to people at first,</p>
<p>but if we think back to our discussion</p>
<p>about the physiology of the blood pressure system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll make sense.</p>
<p>Good scientific studies have been done</p>
<p>where people are told to imagine</p>
<p>or even script out their long-term vision</p>
<p>and goal for themselves.</p>
<p>What is the big goal?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re taught to, or told to,</p>
<p>imagine it with a rich amount of detail,</p>
<p>to think about how it&rsquo;s going to feel in their body</p>
<p>and the big win.</p>
<p>And basically what happens is,</p>
<p>if you measure people&rsquo;s blood pressure</p>
<p>or other metrics of physiology,</p>
<p>you see an increase in that systolic blood pressure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of a ramping up of the readiness</p>
<p>and excitement for that goal.</p>
<p>But that increase in blood pressure quickly wanes.</p>
<p>And over time, that visual of the long-term goal</p>
<p>becomes a poor thing to rely on</p>
<p>in order to generate the actions</p>
<p>that are required to reach that goal.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a much better way</p>
<p>to maintain ongoing action toward a goal</p>
<p>that also involves visualization,</p>
<p>but it turns out it&rsquo;s not about visualizing success,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about visualizing failure.</p>
<p>The Balsettus Lab and other labs</p>
<p>have looked at whether or not people make progress</p>
<p>toward goals of different types,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re thinking about the goal,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re thinking about that goal line</p>
<p>and what they want to achieve,</p>
<p>that long-term goal</p>
<p>and all the wonderful things associated with it,</p>
<p>or whether or not they&rsquo;re thinking about all the ways</p>
<p>in which they could fail and root to that goal, right?</p>
<p>This is not typically what we are encouraged to do.</p>
<p>Typically we are told, don&rsquo;t imagine failure,</p>
<p>push failure out of your mind, only focus on success,</p>
<p>you know, fake it till you make it,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s a phrase that I absolutely hate, frankly,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not even clear what that means.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not even clear what the ethical form of that is.</p>
<p>I think it means continue despite any anxiety</p>
<p>or fear that things won&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>But if you look at the literature,</p>
<p>the scientific literature,</p>
<p>what the Balsettus Lab and other labs have shown</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a near doubling,</p>
<p>near doubling in the probability of reaching one&rsquo;s goal</p>
<p>if you focus routinely on foreshadowing failure.</p>
<p>You think about the ways in which things could fail</p>
<p>if you take action A or you take action B,</p>
<p>and instead, therefore you take action C.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to think about how things could fail</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t get up and run each morning,</p>
<p>if your goal is say a fitness goal.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s use that as an example,</p>
<p>because even though I realize people are in pursuit</p>
<p>of many things, not just fitness,</p>
<p>fitness goals and physical goals are a very concrete thing</p>
<p>that we can all get on the same page about</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re related to actions.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say somebody sets a goal of running five miles</p>
<p>four times a week minimum, and as many as seven,</p>
<p>four times a week minimum before 8 a.m.</p>
<p>Okay, in a previous podcast on habits,</p>
<p>I talked about the benefits of not necessarily</p>
<p>setting specific times that one will do things,</p>
<p>but setting time blocks that one will do things.</p>
<p>So you say before 8 a.m., you&rsquo;re going to run five miles</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s going to happen up to seven days a week, okay?</p>
<p>One version of this would be, okay, sit back in a chair</p>
<p>and think about how great you&rsquo;re going to feel and look</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing this every day,</p>
<p>how your health is going to improve,</p>
<p>how everything&rsquo;s going to, your blood markers of lipids,</p>
<p>et cetera, are going to improve.</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the visualization goal of visualizing the end point.</p>
<p>Turns out that is far less effective</p>
<p>and maybe even counterproductive compared to thinking about</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen if you don&rsquo;t do this,</p>
<p>the negative health outcomes that are going to occur,</p>
<p>the disappointment you&rsquo;re going to have in yourself,</p>
<p>the fact that you&rsquo;re going to wait until 7.30,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not long enough for many people to run five miles.</p>
<p>You got to put it on your shoes as it can be pouring rain</p>
<p>or even hailing or snowing outside.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re not going outside unless you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s particularly motivated to do that, okay?</p>
<p>So foreshadowing failure turns out to be the best way</p>
<p>to motivate toward goal pursuit.</p>
<p>In fact, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a near doubling in the likelihood</p>
<p>that people will reach goals of any kind</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re constantly thinking about how bad</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be if they fail.</p>
<p>If we think back to the neural circuit associated</p>
<p>with assessing value in our goal pursuits,</p>
<p>this makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>The amygdala, that center of the brain that&rsquo;s involved</p>
<p>in anxiety and fear and worry,</p>
<p>well, the amygdala is one of the four core components</p>
<p>of our goal setting and goal pursuit circuitry.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no bypassing that.</p>
<p>There is no one listening to this or watching this</p>
<p>whose amygdala is not involved in their goal setting</p>
<p>and goal pursuit behavior.</p>
<p>And so while I&rsquo;d love to be able to tell you</p>
<p>that all you should think about is rainbows and puppies</p>
<p>and all the wonderful rewarding things</p>
<p>that are going to happen when you achieve your goals,</p>
<p>the truth is you should be thinking mainly</p>
<p>about how bad it&rsquo;s really going to get if you don&rsquo;t do it,</p>
<p>how disappointing yourself you&rsquo;re going to feel,</p>
<p>how it will negatively impact you,</p>
<p>if not in the immediate term, in the long-term,</p>
<p>if indeed your goal is to reach your goal.</p>
<p>So I want to emphasize that I&rsquo;m not interested</p>
<p>in encouraging people to flagellate themselves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m encouraging people to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>And it turns out the best way to do that</p>
<p>is by foreshadowing failure.</p>
<p>And the more specific you can get by writing down</p>
<p>or thinking about or talking about how bad it will be</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t achieve your goals,</p>
<p>the more likely you are to achieve those goals.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for that almost certainly has to do</p>
<p>with increases in systolic blood pressure</p>
<p>and increases in readiness in your system</p>
<p>when you imagine failure.</p>
<p>The brain and body are much better at moving away</p>
<p>from fearful things than towards things we want.</p>
<p>I wish I could tell you that wasn&rsquo;t the case,</p>
<p>but there is a true asymmetry in the way we are built.</p>
<p>In fact, the brain and body can engage</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s called one trial learning.</p>
<p>When something bad happens,</p>
<p>we eat a food that makes us sick,</p>
<p>we have an interaction with a person or place</p>
<p>that we really don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>it only takes one trial to really, one event,</p>
<p>one time to reorient or rewire our neural circuitry</p>
<p>so that we have a bias toward moving away</p>
<p>from that thing in the future.</p>
<p>When things go well, unfortunately,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t often occur.</p>
<p>If things go really, really well,</p>
<p>it might orient our brain and body</p>
<p>toward wanting more of that thing</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll have neural circuitry changes</p>
<p>that will lead us to engage in that particular behavior</p>
<p>or interaction again,</p>
<p>but it is never as effective as these avoidance circuits.</p>
<p>So again, foreshadow failure.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to visualize in a positive way,</p>
<p>do that at the very beginning of some goal pursuit,</p>
<p>maybe intermittently every once in a while,</p>
<p>you imagine the big win of scoring perfect on an exam</p>
<p>or winning the championship or the great relationship,</p>
<p>but most of the time, if you want to be effective,</p>
<p>you should be focusing on avoiding failure</p>
<p>and you should be really clear</p>
<p>about what those failures would look like and feel like.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about goal setting.</p>
<p>Going back to that prominent literature,</p>
<p>the psychology and popular literature again,</p>
<p>we can hear some of these themes start to emerge.</p>
<p>The goal should be significant, we are told.</p>
<p>It should be inspirational.</p>
<p>It should be aggressive yet realistic.</p>
<p>Well, okay, that&rsquo;s all fine and good,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s get semi-quantitative about this.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s at least get biological about this.</p>
<p>How inspirational does it need to be?</p>
<p>Does it need to be the kind of thing</p>
<p>that is so inspiring to me that I can&rsquo;t sleep at all?</p>
<p>Well, that wouldn&rsquo;t be good because I believe,</p>
<p>and I know many of you have heard me say</p>
<p>many, many times before, regular deep sleep,</p>
<p>80% or more of the nights that you go to sleep</p>
<p>is going to be crucial to your cognitive</p>
<p>and mental functioning and your ability</p>
<p>to achieve your goals in the long-term.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s absolutely clear.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s got to be inspirational and exciting,</p>
<p>but what does that really look like?</p>
<p>And what does that correspond to?</p>
<p>And how do we actually make that happen?</p>
<p>Well, once again, there is a mismatch</p>
<p>between what the real data show</p>
<p>and what we&rsquo;re most often told.</p>
<p>Turns out that, again, work in Balsettos&rsquo; lab,</p>
<p>but also other laboratories has addressed</p>
<p>whether or not the probability of achieving a goal</p>
<p>goes up or down, depending on whether or not</p>
<p>one visualizes or sets a goal that is easy,</p>
<p>moderate, or impossible.</p>
<p>Okay, an impossible goal would be, for instance,</p>
<p>if I say, you know, I&rsquo;m going to jump</p>
<p>from my front driveway all the way up to the road.</p>
<p>The road&rsquo;s quite a distance away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more than 20 meters away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not going to happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to happen in this lifetime.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to happen in any other lifetime,</p>
<p>not unless it involves some elaborate technology</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not aware of, a jet pack or something like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not going to happen, right?</p>
<p>An easy goal would be something like,</p>
<p>can you jump or could I jump, you know,</p>
<p>two feet in front of me?</p>
<p>Obviously, yes.</p>
<p>Okay, now I&rsquo;m using a trivial example here,</p>
<p>but this could be translated to any kind of goal,</p>
<p>school goal, physical goal, et cetera.</p>
<p>Turns out that when people set goals,</p>
<p>whether or not they are nutritional goals,</p>
<p>eat more of this or eat less of that,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re fitness goals, you know,</p>
<p>run more, lift more, or some other goal,</p>
<p>swim less, swim more,</p>
<p>whatever it is their goal happens to be,</p>
<p>some learning goal, some relationship goal,</p>
<p>some attempt to modify their behavior,</p>
<p>turns out that if the goal is too easy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too within reach,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t recruit enough of the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>to make pursuit of that goal likely.</p>
<p>Now that might be surprising.</p>
<p>At least it was surprising to me.</p>
<p>You think, well, something is really, really easy.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a very low bar to achieve it.</p>
<p>People are probably more likely to do it,</p>
<p>but it turns out that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>When we hear that a goal needs to be inspirational,</p>
<p>what do we mean?</p>
<p>When we hear that something&rsquo;s too easy</p>
<p>to recruit our action, what do we mean?</p>
<p>Well, Balsettis Lab measured systolic blood pressure</p>
<p>and found that when goals were too easy</p>
<p>for people to attain,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t get that increase in systolic blood pressure</p>
<p>and recruitment of the other neural and vascular systems,</p>
<p>meaning the blood systems and the nervous system,</p>
<p>that would place them into ongoing effort.</p>
<p>And so they quickly gave up.</p>
<p>Also, if a goal was too lofty,</p>
<p>if it was too far from their current abilities,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t recruit enough systolic blood pressure.</p>
<p>Even if people could get very excited</p>
<p>about something mentally,</p>
<p>it simply didn&rsquo;t place their body into a state of readiness</p>
<p>because it wasn&rsquo;t tangible that they could actually</p>
<p>perhaps really achieve it.</p>
<p>So it turns out that when goals were moderate,</p>
<p>when they were just outside of one&rsquo;s immediate abilities</p>
<p>or that one felt that, yeah,</p>
<p>that would take a lot of effort,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s within range or maybe in range,</p>
<p>like maybe I can do it, maybe I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Then there was a near doubling</p>
<p>of the systolic blood pressure in the good sense.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t go into the unhealthy range</p>
<p>and a doubling or more of the likelihood</p>
<p>that they would engage in the ongoing pursuit</p>
<p>of that particular goal.</p>
<p>So here we&rsquo;re talking about goal setting.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re saying is set goals that are realistic,</p>
<p>but that aren&rsquo;t so realistic</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re easy.</p>
<p>The goals need to be realistic and truly challenging.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t set goals that are so challenging and so lofty</p>
<p>that they crash that blood pressure system</p>
<p>in the other direction</p>
<p>and make you or anyone feel unmotivated.</p>
<p>In hearing this, it makes sense,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think I would have predicted it</p>
<p>had they not done this very controlled study.</p>
<p>I would have thought the loftier the goal,</p>
<p>the bigger the goal,</p>
<p>the more that it recruits the autonomic system</p>
<p>and the more that people are likely to lean into the energy</p>
<p>and effort to pursue and attain that goal.</p>
<p>I also would have thought</p>
<p>that if a goal is really easy to achieve,</p>
<p>that it would engage the systems of action</p>
<p>in the brain and body enough</p>
<p>that people would sort of get into motion</p>
<p>and pursue that goal,</p>
<p>but neither is the case.</p>
<p>Again, set goals that are difficult to achieve,</p>
<p>but that are not so lofty</p>
<p>that they collapse your system</p>
<p>and that you feel overwhelmed.</p>
<p>And the important thing here</p>
<p>is that how we perceive a goal,</p>
<p>whether or not we think it&rsquo;s within reach or not,</p>
<p>of course will vary depending on whether or not we are rested</p>
<p>depending on whether or not other aspects of our life</p>
<p>are going well.</p>
<p>I mean, we can think that we are hot on the heels</p>
<p>of a lifetime goal and everything&rsquo;s going well,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;ll be some crisis, interpersonal crisis,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;ll be a health crisis and you&rsquo;ll be shut down.</p>
<p>And then that goal seems very, very hard to attain.</p>
<p>So we will talk about how to update goals</p>
<p>under different contexts in a few minutes.</p>
<p>But of course, this is going to be an averaging.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t something that you do just once.</p>
<p>But the takeaway again is very simple.</p>
<p>Set goals that are moderately hard to hard,</p>
<p>but not so hard nor so easy</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t engage your brain and body properly.</p>
<p>Moderate goals are best if you want to achieve your goals.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to talk about three particular areas</p>
<p>of scientific study that point to goal pursuit,</p>
<p>goal assessment, and goal achievement.</p>
<p>Previously, I told you that it&rsquo;s great to foreshadow failure</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a great way to get your system</p>
<p>into a state of activation.</p>
<p>I also told you that you want to set goals</p>
<p>that are challenging, but possible.</p>
<p>And again, here I&rsquo;m paraphrasing</p>
<p>from the work of Emily Belsetis.</p>
<p>I want to be very clear.</p>
<p>There are a few other things that one can do</p>
<p>in order to bias the likelihood that you will succeed</p>
<p>in trying to achieve your goals.</p>
<p>First of all, limit your options.</p>
<p>Trying to pursue too many goals at once</p>
<p>can definitely be counterproductive.</p>
<p>Now I realized that life is complicated.</p>
<p>We all have multiple goals that we&rsquo;re trying to pursue,</p>
<p>but if we have particular goals that are important to us,</p>
<p>we have to be careful to not get distracted by other goals.</p>
<p>And many people run into this problem.</p>
<p>So setting one or two or maybe three major goals</p>
<p>for a given year is going to be more than enough</p>
<p>for most people and is actually going to be challenging</p>
<p>for most people.</p>
<p>Now, of course we have daily goals and monthly goals</p>
<p>and yearly goals, but if we have big lofty goals,</p>
<p>we need to be careful not to contaminate our mental space</p>
<p>and our visual space with too many goals.</p>
<p>And why do I say visual goals?</p>
<p>Well, what various department stores</p>
<p>and supermarkets have discovered</p>
<p>is that the greater the number of things</p>
<p>in our visual attention,</p>
<p>the more that we can draw our attention and our goals</p>
<p>off a line of pursuit.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s think about it in the practical context.</p>
<p>This has actually been done.</p>
<p>Big department stores have figured out</p>
<p>that if they stock their shelves chock-a-block</p>
<p>with many, many options of food or clothing items</p>
<p>or objects or anything like that,</p>
<p>people simply buy more stuff.</p>
<p>People are very prone to orienting their attention</p>
<p>to whatever&rsquo;s in front of them.</p>
<p>You put a lot of stuff in front of them,</p>
<p>their attention drifts.</p>
<p>You put fewer things in front of them,</p>
<p>their attention is more narrow.</p>
<p>In a later episode, we&rsquo;ll talk about designing a workspace</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized on the basis of this.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean being in a room with nothing</p>
<p>except just your desk and a computer</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to be that sparse,</p>
<p>but visual sparseness actually can help us</p>
<p>orient our focus and our behavior.</p>
<p>When we have a lot of things in our visual environment</p>
<p>or a lot of things in our cognitive environment,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re going to try and pursue a fitness goal,</p>
<p>a relationship goal, an academic goal,</p>
<p>and a long-term life financial goal all at once,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s four things.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to have to come up with systems</p>
<p>that allow you to isolate those goals in a very rigid way.</p>
<p>And if you do have multiple interleaving goals</p>
<p>and overlapping goals and simultaneous goals,</p>
<p>in a few minutes, we&rsquo;re going to talk about a process</p>
<p>that will allow you to use your visual system</p>
<p>to align towards each of those goals sequentially</p>
<p>in a way that makes it much more likely</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll achieve them.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s talk about specificity of goals.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard that the more specific a goal is</p>
<p>and the more specific we are about when</p>
<p>and how we are going to execute that goal,</p>
<p>the higher probability that we will actually</p>
<p>achieve that goal.</p>
<p>And indeed that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s an additional feature that&rsquo;s not often discussed</p>
<p>that is vitally important.</p>
<p>And in fact, maybe more important</p>
<p>than having a specific time of day</p>
<p>or a specific end point in mind.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a really nice study that was done</p>
<p>looking at recycling.</p>
<p>And this is something that a number of groups,</p>
<p>businesses, households, and individuals</p>
<p>are trying to do more of.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to lower carbon footprint</p>
<p>or contribute to the world in some general way</p>
<p>by throwing away fewer things</p>
<p>that could potentially be recycled.</p>
<p>So this has been studied in the context</p>
<p>of the work environment where a business decides</p>
<p>and lets everybody know that there&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>a greater effort toward recycling cans or bottles</p>
<p>or bottles and cans, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then the way these studies were done</p>
<p>is that the janitorial staff was swapped out temporarily</p>
<p>for researchers that actually measured</p>
<p>the number of recyclable items that showed up in the trash</p>
<p>and not in the recycle as a function</p>
<p>of the total amount of trash.</p>
<p>Why did I say as a function of the total amount of trash?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a way of controlling for differences</p>
<p>in beverage consumption from one week to the next.</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is they were able to very carefully</p>
<p>measure how much people are recycling before</p>
<p>and after this call to action to recycle more.</p>
<p>And what they found was if they said,</p>
<p>we are going to try and recycle more,</p>
<p>try not to put cans and bottles in the trash.</p>
<p>There of course was an improvement in recycling,</p>
<p>but it was pretty modest.</p>
<p>Whereas when there was a very concrete plan</p>
<p>and everyone knew what that concrete plan was,</p>
<p>for instance, to place all bottles and cans</p>
<p>into the recycle, not the trash,</p>
<p>or to limit the amount of trash by 50%</p>
<p>or to eliminate all recyclable items from the trash.</p>
<p>So when they made it very concrete,</p>
<p>exactly what the action steps were,</p>
<p>there was a remarkable, I mean,</p>
<p>close to a hundred fold or more improvement</p>
<p>in recycling behavior that lasted many months</p>
<p>after this call to action was made.</p>
<p>The takeaway from this is quite straightforward.</p>
<p>It means that having a concrete plan is essential.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just say, I&rsquo;m going to become a better recycler,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m going to do things that are better for the environment</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m going to become more physically fit.</p>
<p>It has to be a specific set of action steps</p>
<p>that get right down to details</p>
<p>about what success would look like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard this before described as,</p>
<p>what does right look like?</p>
<p>What is the actual outcome that one would like to achieve</p>
<p>in terms of action steps?</p>
<p>So not necessarily feeling states.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that they all sat around and said,</p>
<p>how great we&rsquo;re all going to feel about ourselves</p>
<p>and the world when we accomplish this goal.</p>
<p>It was very concrete statements,</p>
<p>very concrete plans about action steps</p>
<p>that would deliver one to one&rsquo;s goal.</p>
<p>Somewhat straightforward and intuitive,</p>
<p>but nonetheless worthwhile.</p>
<p>What it suggests is that for all of us,</p>
<p>if we have certain goals that we want to achieve,</p>
<p>we need to be exquisitely detailed</p>
<p>about what the action steps are that we&rsquo;re going to take</p>
<p>and to constantly update those action steps</p>
<p>so that we have a higher probability</p>
<p>of meeting those action steps.</p>
<p>Some of you may be asking,</p>
<p>how often should one assess progress?</p>
<p>Well, that of course will depend on the given goal</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to pursue.</p>
<p>But in the studies that I&rsquo;ve been referring to here,</p>
<p>the assessment of progress and the updating</p>
<p>of concrete plans was done weekly.</p>
<p>So it seems like weekly is a good starting place</p>
<p>to address how well one performed in the previous week</p>
<p>and then based on that performance</p>
<p>to update the action plan for the upcoming week.</p>
<p>So weekly seems like a good solid rule of thumb</p>
<p>for setting particular action goals</p>
<p>and assessing one&rsquo;s progress</p>
<p>towards the immediate and longer-term goals.</p>
<p>Any discussion about goals and goal pursuit</p>
<p>would be incomplete without a discussion</p>
<p>about the molecule dopamine.</p>
<p>Dopamine is often thought of as the molecule</p>
<p>of pleasure and reward,</p>
<p>but actually it is the molecule of motivation.</p>
<p>This is best illustrated by a classic set of studies</p>
<p>that have been carried out in both animals and in humans.</p>
<p>The animal study can be described the following way.</p>
<p>Two rats, each in a separate cage.</p>
<p>You can provide those rats with the opportunity</p>
<p>to indulge in something that they like,</p>
<p>like food or mating or heat if it&rsquo;s cold in the environment</p>
<p>or a cool spot in the cage</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s warm in the environment and so forth.</p>
<p>And what you find is that rats will very readily approach</p>
<p>the rewarding thing.</p>
<p>They will mate, they will eat,</p>
<p>they will pursue something that is of pleasure.</p>
<p>Now, if you are to take one of those rats</p>
<p>and deplete its dopamine neurons,</p>
<p>you can eliminate its dopamine neurons</p>
<p>or block dopamine in the brain.</p>
<p>What you find is that those animals</p>
<p>will still enjoy pleasure.</p>
<p>They will consume the food, they will mate, et cetera.</p>
<p>However, their motivation to achieve pleasure</p>
<p>is vastly reduced.</p>
<p>In fact, if you place the item of pleasure,</p>
<p>the mate, the food, et cetera,</p>
<p>even just one rat&rsquo;s length away from that rat,</p>
<p>the rat without dopamine will not even move one length</p>
<p>of its own body in order to achieve that pleasure.</p>
<p>And there are naturally occurring experiments in humans</p>
<p>that mimic that result very accurately.</p>
<p>There are certain conditions in humans</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a depletion of dopamine.</p>
<p>And what you find is that the depletion of dopamine</p>
<p>does not inhibit an ability</p>
<p>to experience pleasure necessarily.</p>
<p>It inhibits an ability to pursue</p>
<p>or go through the series of action steps</p>
<p>in order to achieve pleasure.</p>
<p>So dopamine really sits at the heart</p>
<p>of our motivational state to seek out goals</p>
<p>and to seek pleasure.</p>
<p>And this is true for immediate goals</p>
<p>that take place within a timeframe of minutes</p>
<p>or a timeframe of a day or the timeframe of a week</p>
<p>or the timeframe of a lifetime.</p>
<p>Dopamine is the common currency by which we pursue goals.</p>
<p>Now, dopamine does a number of things</p>
<p>that are very interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to describe a few of them</p>
<p>as they relate to goal-seeking behavior.</p>
<p>First of all, there&rsquo;s a fundamental feature</p>
<p>of how our brain releases and uses dopamine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called reward prediction error.</p>
<p>And the simplest way to think about</p>
<p>dopamine reward prediction error</p>
<p>is that dopamine is released in the greatest amount</p>
<p>and places us into a greater state of motivation</p>
<p>when something happens that&rsquo;s positive and novel.</p>
<p>Now, an important thing to understand about dopamine</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s not always released on the same schedule.</p>
<p>There are a couple of different ways</p>
<p>that dopamine is released and when it is released</p>
<p>relative to your anticipation of a reward is key.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t expect something positive to happen,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just going about your day</p>
<p>and something positive happens,</p>
<p>dopamine and a lot of dopamine is released.</p>
<p>I had this happen recently.</p>
<p>I had no idea that I was going to be receiving something</p>
<p>in the mail, but I went to the mail, I looked in the mail</p>
<p>and I got something very positive</p>
<p>and I was really, really excited about that.</p>
<p>This is a real event that happened just today.</p>
<p>However, if we anticipate something positive</p>
<p>is going to happen and then that thing happens,</p>
<p>we experience dopamine as part of the anticipation.</p>
<p>So even before we get the reward,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an increase in dopamine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as high as it would be if something really novel</p>
<p>and unexpected and positive happened,</p>
<p>but we do get an increase in dopamine.</p>
<p>And then when we actually experience the reward,</p>
<p>we experienced the positive thing,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a smaller increase in dopamine, okay?</p>
<p>So again, the biggest increases in dopamine</p>
<p>are response to things that are positive and unexpected.</p>
<p>Lesser dopamine is released</p>
<p>when we anticipate something good will happen.</p>
<p>And when that happens, yes, we get some dopamine</p>
<p>and we also get some dopamine</p>
<p>when the positive thing happens.</p>
<p>Think about anticipating a great meal with friends.</p>
<p>We have some dopamine churning, friends come over,</p>
<p>then we have the meal</p>
<p>and we also get some dopamine from that,</p>
<p>but not nearly as much as we would</p>
<p>if it all happened as a part of a big surprise.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s also the case in which we predict</p>
<p>that something good will happen.</p>
<p>When that happens, there&rsquo;s an increase in dopamine</p>
<p>just as it was before.</p>
<p>But then if that thing doesn&rsquo;t happen,</p>
<p>for instance, our friends don&rsquo;t show up for dinner,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s a drop in dopamine below our initial baseline.</p>
<p>That drop in dopamine is the chemical essence</p>
<p>of what we call disappointment.</p>
<p>Now, this dopamine reward prediction error, as it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>can be leveraged toward trying to reach our goals</p>
<p>because it tells us where we should set our milestones.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t be in a mode</p>
<p>of simply being focused on the finish line.</p>
<p>Very few people can do that over long periods of time</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s effective.</p>
<p>Now, earlier I talked about a study</p>
<p>where people were focused on a finish line visually</p>
<p>and they were moving through space</p>
<p>with these ankle weights on,</p>
<p>but that was a very short-term goal, okay?</p>
<p>So if a goal is within minutes</p>
<p>or maybe even within an hour</p>
<p>or is in with our immediate visual environment,</p>
<p>maybe we can do that.</p>
<p>But most goals of the sort</p>
<p>that most people are pursuing, fitness goals, academic goals,</p>
<p>business goals, relationship goals, et cetera,</p>
<p>involve some milestones.</p>
<p>So understanding what we know about reward prediction error,</p>
<p>we can make better choices</p>
<p>about where to place the milestones,</p>
<p>how far out in the future to place milestones.</p>
<p>So then the question becomes how often</p>
<p>or at what intervals should one assess progress?</p>
<p>And it turns out this is very subjective,</p>
<p>but that there&rsquo;s a way to make it objective.</p>
<p>Now, in a previous episode of the Uberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>I had a discussion with the great Robert Sapolsky</p>
<p>and we were talking about how the brain</p>
<p>can subjectively change whether or not a given behavior</p>
<p>or experience is positive or negative.</p>
<p>And the example that Robert gave is a really phenomenal one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a study that&rsquo;s been done in rats and also in humans</p>
<p>where it took a rat, they had a rat run on a running wheel.</p>
<p>Rats turns out like to run on running wheels.</p>
<p>And the blood pressure of that animal,</p>
<p>the health metrics for that animal, the lipid profiles,</p>
<p>many, many things improved, okay?</p>
<p>The rat was exercising and it got healthier</p>
<p>and presumably happier, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We could have asked it, but we wouldn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t know how to tell us,</p>
<p>but we can measure blood lipids,</p>
<p>we can measure blood pressure and all sorts of things.</p>
<p>And indeed when that rat exercised or when people exercise,</p>
<p>they generally get healthier.</p>
<p>Except in that particular experiment,</p>
<p>they had another animal where every time rat number one ran,</p>
<p>rat number two was forced to run.</p>
<p>It was on a running wheel and it was forced to run,</p>
<p>not because it wanted to, but because it was forced to.</p>
<p>And what was remarkable is that the physiological effects</p>
<p>of being forced to do something</p>
<p>were in the complete opposite direction as they were</p>
<p>when those same behaviors were undertaken voluntarily.</p>
<p>In other words, the rat that was choosing to run</p>
<p>got healthier and the rat that was forced to run</p>
<p>became unhealthy.</p>
<p>Blood pressure went up in a direction</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t effective and useful.</p>
<p>Blood lipids got worse, stress hormones went up,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>And you see the same thing in humans.</p>
<p>Now, what this says is that our subjective understanding</p>
<p>of why we are doing something is fundamentally important</p>
<p>for the effects that we will get from that behavior.</p>
<p>And indeed the effects of that behavior will have on us.</p>
<p>So this has two major implications.</p>
<p>First of all, in terms of reward schedules,</p>
<p>we can decide to use any reward schedule that we want</p>
<p>for a given behavior.</p>
<p>We can decide that the milestones for a,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say a plan of getting in really terrific</p>
<p>cardiovascular shape over the next year,</p>
<p>we can decide to assess every day and ask ourselves,</p>
<p>how good was our progress?</p>
<p>And if we made progress,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re going to reward ourselves.</p>
<p>We could do that every third day.</p>
<p>We could do it every week.</p>
<p>We could do it every five minutes</p>
<p>if we actually have the time to do that.</p>
<p>The reward schedule,</p>
<p>the dopamine system is highly susceptible</p>
<p>to the subjective effects,</p>
<p>the so-called top-down effects of when we decide</p>
<p>that something is going to be good for us.</p>
<p>If we analyze it on a given timeframe,</p>
<p>well, then it&rsquo;s going to be good for us.</p>
<p>So what I suggest people do is pick a particular interval</p>
<p>at which they are going to assess progress.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve been making regular progress towards a goal</p>
<p>that you reward yourself.</p>
<p>And the reward indeed is all cognitive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all mental.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s telling yourself, yes, I&rsquo;m on the right track.</p>
<p>Now, some people will say, wait,</p>
<p>but I want to know exactly how often I should do that.</p>
<p>You need to do that at an interval</p>
<p>that you can maintain consistently.</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re not going to reward yourself every minute</p>
<p>or every step of every jog that you take,</p>
<p>unless you can do it every minute of every step</p>
<p>of every jog that you take.</p>
<p>For that reason, I think that daily</p>
<p>or ideally weekly assessments are going to be best.</p>
<p>I think that checking in at the end of a week,</p>
<p>looking back on the previous week</p>
<p>and assessing how well you performed</p>
<p>in pursuit of a given goal,</p>
<p>how many times a week you ran</p>
<p>or how many times you studied</p>
<p>or how many times you did something that you wanted to do</p>
<p>or avoided something that you didn&rsquo;t want to do.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a reasonable and tractable schedule</p>
<p>to assess once a week.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one point that pick a milestone</p>
<p>that you can maintain consistently</p>
<p>throughout the pursuit of a goal.</p>
<p>The second thing is that the subjective effects</p>
<p>that were described by that Sapolsky study</p>
<p>or that Sapolsky described rather,</p>
<p>are absolutely essential</p>
<p>for all aspects of goal-seeking behavior.</p>
<p>We cannot underestimate the extent</p>
<p>to which the dopamine system</p>
<p>and our sense of whether or not we were on the right track</p>
<p>is under our cognitive control.</p>
<p>If we constantly place ourself</p>
<p>into a mode of thinking that we are failing,</p>
<p>well, then indeed,</p>
<p>we are not going to churn out much dopamine.</p>
<p>Now, earlier I said we need to predict</p>
<p>and visualize failure,</p>
<p>but that is not the same thing</p>
<p>as thinking about ourselves as failing.</p>
<p>We need to predict what the outcome would be if we failed,</p>
<p>but then encountering that</p>
<p>and in behaving in a certain way</p>
<p>and thinking in a certain way</p>
<p>and pursuing our goals in an effective way,</p>
<p>maybe checking in on that each week,</p>
<p>we definitely need to reward ourselves cognitively</p>
<p>for the correct and successful pursuit.</p>
<p>What this means is that anticipate</p>
<p>and think about failure as a mechanism</p>
<p>of generating motivation and indeed fear and anxiety</p>
<p>so that you lean into the correct behaviors</p>
<p>and you lean away from the incorrect behaviors</p>
<p>to reach your goal.</p>
<p>But then weekly or so,</p>
<p>whatever you can maintain consistently,</p>
<p>you absolutely want to reward yourself cognitively</p>
<p>by telling yourself, I&rsquo;m on the right track.</p>
<p>I got another week where I accomplished</p>
<p>whatever it is that I&rsquo;m trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>A concrete example that I&rsquo;m following now</p>
<p>is this 150 to 200 minutes of zone two cardio per week,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s shown to be very effective</p>
<p>in improving mental and physical health metrics.</p>
<p>So once a week, I&rsquo;ll check in with myself.</p>
<p>If I reach that 150 to 200 minute threshold,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;ll reward myself simply by checking off a box</p>
<p>and saying, okay, I&rsquo;m on track, I&rsquo;m on track, I&rsquo;m on track.</p>
<p>This dopamine system is critical to re-up,</p>
<p>to remind ourselves that we are on track</p>
<p>if indeed we are on track,</p>
<p>because dopamine itself provides a state of motivation</p>
<p>and readiness to continue</p>
<p>in the regular pursuit of our goals.</p>
<p>Dopamine, the molecule is actually used</p>
<p>to manufacture epinephrine and norepinephrine,</p>
<p>which are other molecules in our brain and body,</p>
<p>which put us into that readiness and action state.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually the molecules that help generate</p>
<p>that increase in systolic blood pressure</p>
<p>that puts us into a state of readiness.</p>
<p>So you can think about dopamine as a self-amplifying system</p>
<p>provided that you are leveraging the dopamine system</p>
<p>on a consistent schedule.</p>
<p>Now, by also following a consistent schedule of self-reward,</p>
<p>you set yourself up for any positive unanticipated rewards</p>
<p>that may happen.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you&rsquo;re checking in with yourself weekly,</p>
<p>telling yourself that you&rsquo;re doing well, if indeed you are,</p>
<p>and then out of nowhere, for instance, you&rsquo;re out on a run</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re doing something, I&rsquo;m using fitness as an example,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re doing something,</p>
<p>you find yourself performing particularly well,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a unexpected dopamine reward</p>
<p>that will further amplify the system.</p>
<p>Now, I know many people out there,</p>
<p>having heard me talk about dopamine before worry,</p>
<p>well, can I release too much dopamine</p>
<p>and then the whole system will crash</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll run out of motivation.</p>
<p>In general, that doesn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>unless people are using pharmacology, supplements</p>
<p>or prescription drugs or illicit drugs to increase dopamine.</p>
<p>This is why I&rsquo;m a big fan of things like cold showers</p>
<p>and cold water exposure, which has been shown to lead</p>
<p>to long lasting 2.5X increases in dopamine.</p>
<p>Or in some cases, supplementation with things</p>
<p>like L-tyrosine, which are precursors to dopamine.</p>
<p>Or in some cases, caffeine,</p>
<p>which can increase the number of dopamine receptors</p>
<p>that we have so that whatever dopamine we have</p>
<p>floating around can be more effective</p>
<p>in activating these motivational states.</p>
<p>But things that really increase dopamine</p>
<p>and then cause it to crash can be problematic.</p>
<p>One way to conceive of dopamine</p>
<p>is as a sort of dopamine wave pool.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably seen these wave pools</p>
<p>where some pressure is pushed into the pool</p>
<p>and then you get these waves going.</p>
<p>If those waves are consistent enough,</p>
<p>but they, and they&rsquo;re of high enough amplitude,</p>
<p>the waves can continue to go up and down and up and down.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s a giant wave,</p>
<p>if you get a huge blast of dopamine,</p>
<p>well, then a bunch of the water sloshes</p>
<p>out of the wave pool.</p>
<p>And then you basically have to take some time off,</p>
<p>reset that dopamine level.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what happens in addiction.</p>
<p>When people start pushing in a lot of drugs</p>
<p>or other things into the system</p>
<p>that increase dopamine too much.</p>
<p>So today we&rsquo;ve almost exclusively been talking</p>
<p>about behavioral tools.</p>
<p>It is possible to incorporate supplements</p>
<p>and things of that sort that can increase dopamine</p>
<p>as a way to getting into ongoing motivational states.</p>
<p>But I caution people about relying on those too much.</p>
<p>Really what you want is you want a situation</p>
<p>where your own positive feedback,</p>
<p>your own understanding that you are reaching</p>
<p>the milestones that you&rsquo;ve set out for yourself,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re achieving those.</p>
<p>And that is what&rsquo;s causing these waves</p>
<p>or these increases in dopamine</p>
<p>that will further amplify your motivational states.</p>
<p>Another very interesting aspect of dopamine</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve not talked about at all on this podcast before</p>
<p>is actually how the dopamine system interacts</p>
<p>with the visual system.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked a lot about how harnessing</p>
<p>your visual attention to a particular point is great</p>
<p>and can help serve your ability to both set</p>
<p>and achieve goals.</p>
<p>Really wonderful work that was done by Wolfram Schultz,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s one of the great pioneers in this area of dopamine</p>
<p>and dopamine reward prediction error,</p>
<p>showed that for people that have normal levels of dopamine,</p>
<p>their visual search,</p>
<p>meaning how they scan visual environments,</p>
<p>tends to be pretty constrained.</p>
<p>They might move their eyes around</p>
<p>a particular visual environment searching somewhat.</p>
<p>For people that lack dopamine,</p>
<p>they actually have very little movement of their eyes.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t actually tend to look very far</p>
<p>into the horizon.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have that very focused vergence point</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about that kind of,</p>
<p>I guess, for lack of a better phrase,</p>
<p>that kind of eye of the tiger focus on a goal.</p>
<p>Rather, their eye movements are depleted</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not actually evaluating horizons</p>
<p>off in their future.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not focused so much on the extra personal space.</p>
<p>And this actually can be restored in some of these</p>
<p>that took place in Parkinson&rsquo;s patients</p>
<p>and other people who have dopamine depleted,</p>
<p>that when dopamine is restored pharmacologically,</p>
<p>their visual focus is re-enhanced again.</p>
<p>Now, there are a lot of details to this study</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t map perfectly onto everything</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve talked about.</p>
<p>But the point is this,</p>
<p>when we are focused on a particular point in visual space</p>
<p>or its particular goal or horizon,</p>
<p>all those systems, our blood pressure, epinephrine,</p>
<p>and indeed dopamine get recruited</p>
<p>to put us into a state of readiness and willingness</p>
<p>to go pursue things in that extra personal space.</p>
<p>When our visual attention is very diffuse,</p>
<p>all of that relaxes and we tend to be more comfortable</p>
<p>staying in the place that we are in our peripersonal space.</p>
<p>And the effect works in the other direction too.</p>
<p>When dopamine is increased,</p>
<p>our visual attention for particular things</p>
<p>out in space increase.</p>
<p>So the way it works is reciprocal.</p>
<p>When we use our visual system in a particular way,</p>
<p>bring it to a point of focus,</p>
<p>it recruits chemical and neural systems</p>
<p>in our brain and body that put us into a state</p>
<p>of readiness and pursuit.</p>
<p>And when we increase certain chemicals</p>
<p>in our brain and body like epinephrine, like dopamine,</p>
<p>then we also allow our visual system to be in a state</p>
<p>of looking out at particular locations in our visual world.</p>
<p>So the system works in both directions.</p>
<p>And some people leverage this by using things like caffeine</p>
<p>or taking things like L-tyrosine to increase dopamine.</p>
<p>And again, it works both ways.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no right or wrong way to do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a particular fan of using behavioral tools</p>
<p>always prior to using supplementation</p>
<p>or any kinds of other tools,</p>
<p>because behavioral tools have a very unique feature</p>
<p>that supplementation and other chemical tools don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>which is that behavioral tools used over time</p>
<p>engage neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>As we start to practice using our visual system</p>
<p>to harness our attention to particular locations,</p>
<p>and in that way move toward particular goals,</p>
<p>we get better and better at using those systems.</p>
<p>In fact, the systems for focus and motivation</p>
<p>themselves have plasticity.</p>
<p>So we get better at being motivated and focused</p>
<p>when we place our visual attention at a given location.</p>
<p>Using chemical assistance of a safe kind,</p>
<p>of course, check with your doctor,</p>
<p>but things like L-tyrosine or caffeine or those combined,</p>
<p>yes, it will increase dopamine and will increase our ability</p>
<p>to engage in visual focus somewhat.</p>
<p>But those compounds alone don&rsquo;t modify the circuitries</p>
<p>in the way that we want.</p>
<p>So I always say behavioral tools first,</p>
<p>then nutritional tools, then supplementation tools.</p>
<p>And then if it&rsquo;s right for you and safe,</p>
<p>maybe you advance into some of the other</p>
<p>more sophisticated tools.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to just briefly recap</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;ve covered up until now.</p>
<p>And again, emphasize that much of what I&rsquo;ve covered</p>
<p>has been based on the beautiful work</p>
<p>of Emily Balsettis and colleagues.</p>
<p>I do hope to get her as a guest on the podcast, by the way.</p>
<p>First of all, set goals that are challenging but possible.</p>
<p>Those moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult,</p>
<p>but moderately challenging goals</p>
<p>seem to be the most effective in moving people</p>
<p>towards their goals over the short and long-term.</p>
<p>Second, plan concretely.</p>
<p>You need a concrete set of actions</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to follow in order to reach your goals.</p>
<p>Third, foreshadow failure.</p>
<p>This is a somewhat surprising one to me.</p>
<p>I would have anticipated that imagining success</p>
<p>is the way to go.</p>
<p>It turns out that imagining success and visualizing success</p>
<p>can be useful at the outset of a goal</p>
<p>and maybe every once in a while in pursuit of that goal,</p>
<p>but that it&rsquo;s not terrific for putting you</p>
<p>in constant pursuit of that goal.</p>
<p>Rather, foreshadowing failure,</p>
<p>visualizing failure and all the terrible things</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s going to bring seems to be more effective.</p>
<p>And that maps very well to what&rsquo;s known</p>
<p>about the neural circuitry</p>
<p>and the involvement of the amygdala.</p>
<p>Focus on particular visual points</p>
<p>as a way to harness your attention</p>
<p>and to remove distractors.</p>
<p>Removing distractors and getting your body and brain</p>
<p>into a mode of activation,</p>
<p>getting that healthy increase in systolic blood pressure</p>
<p>that puts you into forward motion</p>
<p>towards your goals is absolutely key.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a brief summary of what I&rsquo;ve covered up until now.</p>
<p>There were other things too, of course,</p>
<p>the dopamine system and the power</p>
<p>of subjective top-down control</p>
<p>in regulating that dopamine system.</p>
<p>But I want to be sure to include a tool</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been especially powerful for me,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s grounded in the neuroscience research</p>
<p>and in the psychology research.</p>
<p>And as I describe this tool next,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll see the ways in which it meshes nicely</p>
<p>with the work that Emily Balsettis and colleagues have done.</p>
<p>This is something that I&rsquo;ve personally been doing</p>
<p>for many years based on my understanding</p>
<p>of the visual system and the understanding</p>
<p>that indeed we can move our cognition</p>
<p>and our perception from a place of interoception</p>
<p>and focusing on our peripersonal space,</p>
<p>that space within us and immediately around us</p>
<p>and on the things that are immediately accessible to us,</p>
<p>that we can shift from that mode</p>
<p>to this mode of exteroception,</p>
<p>of focusing on things outside the confines of our skin</p>
<p>and that are beyond our reach,</p>
<p>that are literally goal-directed behaviors</p>
<p>and goal-directed thoughts.</p>
<p>And this is something that in the past,</p>
<p>I talked about a little bit</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve talked about something called spacetime bridging.</p>
<p>And we haven&rsquo;t talked too much about the time domain</p>
<p>of the visual system today,</p>
<p>but spacetime bridging is simply a way</p>
<p>of using one&rsquo;s visual system to focus</p>
<p>on the peripersonal space and interoception</p>
<p>and then gradually in a deliberate way,</p>
<p>stepping one&rsquo;s focus into the extra personal space</p>
<p>and then back to the peripersonal space</p>
<p>in a way that gives you a lot of flexibility</p>
<p>and control over that ability in your daily life.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to first describe the tool</p>
<p>and then I will explain more about the underlying science</p>
<p>and the underlying mechanism.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how you would do this.</p>
<p>You could do this indoors or outdoors,</p>
<p>although ideally you would do it in a location</p>
<p>where you could view a horizon.</p>
<p>It could be through a window</p>
<p>or ideally outdoors without a window.</p>
<p>Could be done any time of day.</p>
<p>At night, it might be a little more challenging,</p>
<p>but it goes the following way.</p>
<p>What you first do is you would close your eyes.</p>
<p>This could be done seated or standing,</p>
<p>but you would close your eyes</p>
<p>and you would focus as much of your attention,</p>
<p>including your visual attention on your inner landscape,</p>
<p>on your interoception.</p>
<p>So that would be your breathing, your heart rate,</p>
<p>maybe even the surface of your skin,</p>
<p>but really focusing internally.</p>
<p>Now, how can you focus your visual attention internally</p>
<p>if your eyes are closed?</p>
<p>Well, you do that by imagining your inner landscape, okay?</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have to imagine your heart beating</p>
<p>and so forth, but what you&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>is eliminate perception of the outside world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re eliminating exteroception</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re focusing all of your cognitive attention</p>
<p>and your perceptual attention</p>
<p>on what you&rsquo;re experiencing within the confines</p>
<p>of your skin or at the level of the surface of your skin</p>
<p>and inside your body.</p>
<p>And you would do that for a duration</p>
<p>of approximately three slow breaths, okay?</p>
<p>So close your eyes.</p>
<p>You would do breath one, breath two, and breath three,</p>
<p>concentrating all your attention on your internal landscape.</p>
<p>Then you would open your eyes</p>
<p>and you would focus your visual attention</p>
<p>on some area on the surface of your body.</p>
<p>So for me, the way that I typically do this</p>
<p>will be to focus on, say, the palm of my hand.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll focus my visual attention on the palm of my hand.</p>
<p>And I then do three breaths again,</p>
<p>focusing on my internal state,</p>
<p>but now I&rsquo;m splitting out a little bit of my attention</p>
<p>from interoception to exteroception.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m focusing on something outside me.</p>
<p>The ratio or the split of attention is about 90-10.</p>
<p>About 90% of my attention is focused internally,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also focusing some of my attention externally.</p>
<p>Most people can do this pretty easily.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s a third, what I call station.</p>
<p>I now move my visual attention to outside my body,</p>
<p>to some location in the room,</p>
<p>or if I&rsquo;m outside in the external environment,</p>
<p>something in the range of five to 15 feet away.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying to move 90% of my attention</p>
<p>to that external object.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m really biasing my perception</p>
<p>and my attention towards exteroception.</p>
<p>As I breathe, I&rsquo;m paying attention to those three breaths.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s still 10%</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s focused on my internal landscape</p>
<p>because I want to pay attention to those three breaths,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m focusing as much of my attention</p>
<p>outside of myself,</p>
<p>maintaining just a little bit on my internal state</p>
<p>so I can measure the cadence of those three breaths.</p>
<p>Then I move my visual attention to yet another station,</p>
<p>which is further away, typically a horizon</p>
<p>or something as far off in the distance</p>
<p>as I can possibly see.</p>
<p>Again, for the duration of three breaths.</p>
<p>And at that point, I&rsquo;m trying my very best to move 99,</p>
<p>if not 100% of my attention to that external location.</p>
<p>And then what I typically will do</p>
<p>is I will try and expand both my vision</p>
<p>and my cognition to a much broader sphere.</p>
<p>This is that magnocellular vision</p>
<p>that we talked about before,</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m not focusing on a particular location</p>
<p>on the horizon,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to dilate the aperture of my field of view</p>
<p>so I can see as much of the visual landscape</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m in as possible.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in an internal, excuse me, if you&rsquo;re in indoors,</p>
<p>then that might be the ceiling, the walls,</p>
<p>and the floor of the environment you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re outdoors,</p>
<p>it would be to expand your visual focus</p>
<p>as broadly as you possibly can,</p>
<p>again, for the duration of three breaths.</p>
<p>Then I would return immediately to my internal landscape.</p>
<p>I would close my eyes</p>
<p>and I would do three more breaths</p>
<p>focusing entirely on my interoception,</p>
<p>on my internal landscape,</p>
<p>or what we called before my peripersonal space.</p>
<p>And I would then repeat that.</p>
<p>Peripersonal space, 100%.</p>
<p>Focused on my hand, 90%,</p>
<p>10% on my peripersonal space or my internal landscape.</p>
<p>Stepping out to another location</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s mostly exteroception,</p>
<p>maybe a little bit of recognition of my internal state.</p>
<p>Then to the horizon,</p>
<p>then to this broader visual sphere,</p>
<p>then back into my body.</p>
<p>And I would work through each of those stations</p>
<p>maybe two or three times.</p>
<p>The entire thing takes about 90 seconds to three minutes,</p>
<p>depending on how many breaths you do.</p>
<p>I said three, but you could do one or 10,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s also going to depend on, for instance,</p>
<p>how slowly you&rsquo;re breathing,</p>
<p>because your breathing might be faster than mine</p>
<p>or vice versa.</p>
<p>What is all of this doing?</p>
<p>Why do I call this space-time bridging?</p>
<p>And why is this useful for goal setting?</p>
<p>The reason I call it space-time bridging</p>
<p>is that the visual system is not just about analyzing space,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually how we batch time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how we carve up time.</p>
<p>And the simple way to state this</p>
<p>is that when we focus our visual attention</p>
<p>on a very narrow point,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s close to our body and our immediate experience,</p>
<p>we tend to slice up time very finely.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re focused on our breathing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re focused on our heartbeats.</p>
<p>In fact, our breathing and our internal landscape</p>
<p>and our heartbeats become the sort of second hand,</p>
<p>if you will, on our experience.</p>
<p>We are carving up time</p>
<p>according to our immediate physiological experience.</p>
<p>Whereas when we focus our visual attention outside our body,</p>
<p>not only do we engage</p>
<p>that exteroceptive extra personal space system</p>
<p>and we start to engage the dopamine system,</p>
<p>the goal-directed system,</p>
<p>but we also start batching time differently.</p>
<p>When we focus our visual system</p>
<p>into a broader sphere of space</p>
<p>or into a space beyond the confines of our skin,</p>
<p>we start carving up time.</p>
<p>Our frame rate changes.</p>
<p>Now, this is useful in the context of goal setting,</p>
<p>goal assessment, and goal pursuit</p>
<p>because with the exception of a very few isolated examples,</p>
<p>almost all goals involve setting some goal</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s off in the future</p>
<p>and then carving up the time between now</p>
<p>and the achievement of that goal into milestones</p>
<p>that range in duration.</p>
<p>And the rewards,</p>
<p>even if we try and just make them every week,</p>
<p>are going to come at some unexpected intervals.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually can be helpful for reinforcing behavior,</p>
<p>intermittent reward that&rsquo;s intermittent and random</p>
<p>is the most effective reward schedule we know.</p>
<p>But the problem is always how do we keep our cognition</p>
<p>in line with the long-term goal</p>
<p>while also being focused on these more immediate goals?</p>
<p>And so this particular practice</p>
<p>that I call space-time bridging,</p>
<p>but we could give it a different name.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are better names.</p>
<p>Maybe you can suggest some in the comment section on YouTube</p>
<p>that are more accurate or more mapped to it better.</p>
<p>But this behavior or this practice rather</p>
<p>is teaching us to use our visual system</p>
<p>and thereby our cognitive system</p>
<p>and thereby our reward systems</p>
<p>to orient to different locations in space</p>
<p>and therefore at different locations in time.</p>
<p>And that is the essence of goal-directed behavior.</p>
<p>That is the essence of setting a goal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about thinking about what you want.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s about setting milestones</p>
<p>that are intermediate to that goal.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s about assessing</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re reaching those milestones.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s of course about updating your goals</p>
<p>if you need to update your goals.</p>
<p>All of that is an enormously confusing batch of challenges</p>
<p>if you think about it all at once.</p>
<p>But if you break it down into these elements</p>
<p>that the visual system can help you find</p>
<p>and move towards those milestones,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s ample evidence to support that,</p>
<p>and that your control over your visual system</p>
<p>is indeed yours,</p>
<p>that you can deliberately set it to different locations.</p>
<p>And then you make a practice</p>
<p>of stepping through these different stations</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, I do this each morning.</p>
<p>I do this once a day.</p>
<p>Rarely have I done it twice a day.</p>
<p>Rarely have I missed a day.</p>
<p>But by doing that,</p>
<p>you can be very effective in teaching the systems</p>
<p>of your brain that are related to goal-setting and reward</p>
<p>to map to different timeframes.</p>
<p>So I found this to be a very effective protocol.</p>
<p>The Balsettis work has mainly focused on visual tools</p>
<p>that are of a single horizon.</p>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;m talking about multiple,</p>
<p>what I call stations or horizons.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s very clear is that an ability to move</p>
<p>from different visual stations</p>
<p>and to do that in a deliberate way,</p>
<p>in a focused and conscious way,</p>
<p>clearly maps to an ability to conceive of different goals</p>
<p>over different periods of time.</p>
<p>And I do believe can be greatly beneficial</p>
<p>in allowing one to set particular goals</p>
<p>and then move through the milestones to those goals</p>
<p>and to constantly update one&rsquo;s pursuit</p>
<p>and reward in reaching those milestones</p>
<p>and eventually the overall goal.</p>
<p>Per usual, I covered a lot of material today.</p>
<p>We talked about some of the neuroscience and psychology</p>
<p>and popular understanding of goal-seeking behavior,</p>
<p>how to assess goals, et cetera.</p>
<p>Talked about the beautiful work of Emily Balsettis</p>
<p>at New York University and her work</p>
<p>on the use of the visual system to better achieve goals.</p>
<p>And indeed things like visualization</p>
<p>and why forecasting failure can be more effective</p>
<p>than forecasting success.</p>
<p>As counterintuitive as that might seem,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what the data point to.</p>
<p>And we talked about the importance</p>
<p>of setting concrete plans and really what that means</p>
<p>and what intervals at which to assess progress</p>
<p>and what intervals at which to assess reward</p>
<p>and how the dopamine system is involved.</p>
<p>And in addition, I described this practice</p>
<p>that one can incorporate as a daily or semi-daily practice</p>
<p>of so-called space-time bridging,</p>
<p>of using the visual system and your ability</p>
<p>to deliberately step your visual system</p>
<p>from stations that are within your body,</p>
<p>so-called peripersonal or interoceptive space</p>
<p>out into the world further and further</p>
<p>and then back again in sequence</p>
<p>as a way to harness and cultivate</p>
<p>and build up these systems that link vision,</p>
<p>space, time, reward systems, and so forth.</p>
<p>Ultimately, as you set out to accomplish your goals,</p>
<p>there are going to be a number of basic steps</p>
<p>that everyone will have to follow.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have to clearly identify</p>
<p>what the long-arching ultimate goal is.</p>
<p>You have to identify what the milestones will be.</p>
<p>You might not know all of them at the outset,</p>
<p>but you ought to have some idea about the intervals</p>
<p>at which you are going to set those milestones</p>
<p>and set your reward schedule for assessing progress</p>
<p>in route to those milestones and your ultimate goal.</p>
<p>My hope is that you&rsquo;ll be able to incorporate these tools,</p>
<p>if not all of them, perhaps just one of them</p>
<p>or two of them in pursuit of whatever particular goals</p>
<p>you happen to be focused on at this point and in the future.</p>
