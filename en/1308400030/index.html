    <p>Hi friends, so this week. I&rsquo;m gonna deconstruct some things around why everything seems so goddamn hard</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got three points or kind of like areas to deconstruct and when I say deconstruct bitch</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all know how I do. I&rsquo;m a deconstruct the motherfucker</p>
<p>So my three areas are kind of like just different things to take into consideration</p>
<p>But what I mean by why things seem so hard</p>
<p>I mean like why shit seems so difficult like there&rsquo;s so many things that logically</p>
<p>Should seem easy and you plan for it to go easy</p>
<p>And it just don&rsquo;t work like that like the shit is just hard, and I&rsquo;m gonna go into my little theories about why?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not even theories bitch because they&rsquo;re that right like there&rsquo;s just different perspectives around it</p>
<p>Okay, so for the first one. Let&rsquo;s just jump right into this shit</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just gonna give you an example because this is the easiest one so let&rsquo;s say you want to start</p>
<p>Putting yourself on a schedule like you want to start working out</p>
<p>You want to start eating healthy you want to get on a schedule, and you want to like get your life structured, okay?</p>
<p>It is so easy</p>
<p>To fucking sit down when you&rsquo;re excited and start listing out all the shit</p>
<p>You want to do all the things you&rsquo;re gonna start incorporating the workouts you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>Do the outfits you&rsquo;re gonna buy the foods you&rsquo;re gonna buy and then start cooking the meals you&rsquo;re gonna make the way you&rsquo;re gonna start</p>
<p>Living you&rsquo;re gonna get up at 6 a.m.. Like a happy fucking dick</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re just gonna like run off into the fucking sunset everything&rsquo;s gonna be perfectly fine</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m kind of being dramatic</p>
<p>but my point is it&rsquo;s so easy to make a list of all these things that you want to do and it&rsquo;s so like</p>
<p>Logical it makes so much sense and it seems so achievable. You&rsquo;re like yes. I can totally do this</p>
<p>I can totally get up at 6 a.m.. And make my fucking</p>
<p>Veggie-ass smoothie that I&rsquo;m gonna convince myself tastes good with my collagen powder</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m gonna do my 45 step skincare routine</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m gonna get in the car and go to the gym</p>
<p>With only one cup of coffee, and I&rsquo;m gonna do that consistently like it&rsquo;s so easy to see how it could logically make sense</p>
<p>Like it it&rsquo;s so easy to make changes. It&rsquo;s so easy to implement shit</p>
<p>until you go to implement it and the thing that a lot of people are missing with that shit is</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re logical and you&rsquo;re like okay? This is how my day is gonna. Go. This is the new activities</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do this is the new schedule</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna live on like I&rsquo;m gonna start going to the gym and making my food and all of us in that like it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>Easy to make that up</p>
<p>So you basically set it up in your head when you&rsquo;re being logical you set it up in your head</p>
<p>This is what you&rsquo;re gonna start doing. This is how it&rsquo;s gonna go and you&rsquo;re like okay great seems relatively simple</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be a little bit of hard work great</p>
<p>But like I&rsquo;m gonna do this and you set it up in your mind to go this way</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like to get these things done, and you can set it up</p>
<p>And you can see how it&rsquo;s gonna be so smooth how many times have we&rsquo;ve been sitting there at night</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re like oh my god tomorrow</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna wake up at 6 and I&rsquo;m gonna like get up early and I&rsquo;m gonna start my day</p>
<p>And then we go to sleep and when we&rsquo;re trying to wake up</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re snoozing the fuck out of that alarm like we don&rsquo;t want to fucking get up like it&rsquo;s nice when it&rsquo;s logical</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice when it&rsquo;s like the day before when you&rsquo;re planning it because you set it up in your mind that it&rsquo;s gonna go</p>
<p>Swimmingly that things are just gonna go smoothly</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s your expectation</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you expect to happen, and then when anything goes off plan like that</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it just seems so fucking difficult it seems so hard, but you don&rsquo;t realize you&rsquo;re setting that expectation up</p>
<p>You know like you&rsquo;re not taking into consideration</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna motherfucking feel like it is gonna be uncomfortable like you&rsquo;re not gonna ever feel like fucking doing this shit</p>
<p>You will sometimes when it&rsquo;s logical when it&rsquo;s the night before you feel like doing it</p>
<p>But like when it comes time to do it</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna fucking do it</p>
<p>But my whole point is you&rsquo;re setting up this</p>
<p>Expectation in your head of how things are supposed to go and you&rsquo;re failing to take into consideration a huge part</p>
<p>Which is your emotions you&rsquo;re not always gonna feel good. You&rsquo;re not always gonna feel motivated</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not always gonna be like wanting to eat your fucking spinach smoothie like who the fuck does you know what I mean like the?</p>
<p>First day when you start a new routine. It&rsquo;s like ooh easy-peasy</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so happy with this dry-ass fucking oatmeal and then the next day you&rsquo;re like man fuck this shit like it&rsquo;s easy when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Optimistic, but then when reality sets in of what it&rsquo;s actually like to work towards something</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like what the fuck, but you don&rsquo;t plan for it like nobody plans for</p>
<p>Not feeling like it. It&rsquo;s like when you&rsquo;re in that happy phase of okay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna make these changes, and I&rsquo;m gonna do this thing. It&rsquo;s like great cool fun, and then that feeling doesn&rsquo;t last</p>
<p>But you didn&rsquo;t plan for it to wear off so everything is just gonna seem really difficult</p>
<p>For no fucking reason and then that&rsquo;s where a lot of people will be like oh my god</p>
<p>Something&rsquo;s gone wrong like it shouldn&rsquo;t be this hard, and I just want to reassure you babe</p>
<p>You just failed to take into consideration</p>
<p>The reality of what was gonna happen like when you were planning</p>
<p>You only took half of the reality and the other half that you left out was your emotions and the way this shit&rsquo;s gonna feel</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my first little perspective around why shit seems so goddamn difficult</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re not planning for the emotions</p>
<p>That don&rsquo;t feel good like you&rsquo;re only planning for the ones that are happy and like whoo like if we can do this</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go drink our fucking spinach</p>
<p>So my second theory around this piggybacks kind of off of that one, but kind of not really so just hang with me</p>
<p>When people try something new like anytime you try something new it&rsquo;s gonna feel uncomfortable as fuck. It&rsquo;s gonna be weird</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be anxious. It&rsquo;s just not gonna feel good all the time</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of emotions that come up that are uncomfortable when you&rsquo;re trying something new and</p>
<p>Part of me wants to be like yeah</p>
<p>No shit</p>
<p>like every time I&rsquo;m trying something new like when I went to the alpha land for the first time like the gym that I the</p>
<p>Big gym that I joined when I went there for the first time. I was anxious as fuck cuz it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new gym. I&rsquo;m starting a new thing. I&rsquo;m around all new people around a whole new environment</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know yet, but I feel anxious and I observe myself feeling anxious and I&rsquo;m like, yeah, no shit. You&rsquo;re anxious</p>
<p>everything you&rsquo;re experiencing right now is new and</p>
<p>The meaning you assign to the feeling of new things is what will make it a good experience or a bad experience</p>
<p>Because you can take this anxiety and these feelings when you&rsquo;re trying something new or you&rsquo;re doing something unfamiliar</p>
<p>When you make that shit mean something is bad or something has gone wrong. You&rsquo;re fucking yourself</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re literally fucking yourself and you&rsquo;re gonna ruin the entire experience</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s gonna become negative as soon as you say these feelings are not good. I should not be feeling them</p>
<p>So that makes sense. I promise my third theory has nothing to do with feelings</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why the first two do but</p>
<p>My third one&rsquo;s kind of like off on its own little thing</p>
<p>That one&rsquo;s gonna get deep but I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m getting flustered right now like recording this right now</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like pissing me off. I don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s pissing me off. I&rsquo;m just like I</p>
<p>Always start this bitch. Hey friends. So like hey friends, like I&rsquo;m gonna let y&rsquo;all know it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m upstate like I&rsquo;m venting right now</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m just aggravated like these first two points are about emotions and feelings like okay girl</p>
<p>We fucking get it. I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m annoyed with myself right now</p>
<p>But this is a really important thing</p>
<p>With the whole newness like you guys get what I&rsquo;m talking about. You guys fucking get it</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re aware and aggravated just like me like you fucking get it</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to explain myself, but that&rsquo;s a really big thing</p>
<p>So with trying something new when you have those feelings come up of like, oh my god, I&rsquo;m anxious. This is new</p>
<p>This is weird. If you&rsquo;re a little scared, that&rsquo;s kind of normal</p>
<p>But one if you didn&rsquo;t prepare yourself to feel them</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna kind of throw you off like you&rsquo;re not expecting to feel them</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re gonna throw you off and then what you tell yourself about the way you&rsquo;re feeling is</p>
<p>What can make shit seem really really difficult like my example with trying the new gym all those feelings I was feeling it was like a</p>
<p>lot to take on and</p>
<p>There was so much more to it then. Oh, I tried a new gym</p>
<p>Like I just sounded real fucking dramatic, but like I&rsquo;m someone that&rsquo;s known online</p>
<p>So I get recognized a lot. I stick out like a sore fucking thumb</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m six seven but going to this gym</p>
<p>it was like a very influencer filled gym like everybody knows everybody and everybody&rsquo;s seen everybody on fucking tic-tac and</p>
<p>I was like one taking on the fact of I&rsquo;m in a whole new environment</p>
<p>Everyone looks fucking hot and that&rsquo;s intimidating and then who is looking at me and recognizes me and is not saying anything</p>
<p>that is something I live with all the time when I&rsquo;m out in public like who the fuck is seeing me right now and</p>
<p>Recognizing me and not saying anything that shit trips me out</p>
<p>But like that was on the back of my mind, too</p>
<p>And then also I don&rsquo;t want to look dumb like I&rsquo;m already like lost in this gym</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where the fuck anything is</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m trying to like keep it together and like there was just a lot of feelings going on with that whole experience, but I</p>
<p>Literally just tell myself all the time. Yeah, no shit. Like when I&rsquo;m anxious. No shit. You&rsquo;re in a whole new gym, babe</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s totally normal. You&rsquo;re totally okay. That&rsquo;s how I talk to myself</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you&rsquo;re okay. Like I literally comfort myself. Like I&rsquo;m a little kid. I&rsquo;m like, you&rsquo;re all right. You&rsquo;re okay</p>
<p>Come on, like I know that sounds so stupid, but I say it out loud to myself</p>
<p>So you if you ever see me like talking to myself in public leave me a goddamn alone. I</p>
<p>Need comfort for some whatever reason so I just give it to myself</p>
<p>But that experience at the gym like I was able to comfort myself through it and get through it like it was fine</p>
<p>I actually had a really good fucking time because I didn&rsquo;t tell myself anything was wrong with how I was feeling</p>
<p>But if that was my first experience trying this new thing and it came with all these heavy feelings and all this like</p>
<p>Uncomfortable like all these uncomfortable sensations like if that was my first experience</p>
<p>People sometimes don&rsquo;t know to remind their self. That&rsquo;s gonna fade away</p>
<p>So like when you try something new, it&rsquo;s very uncomfortable at the beginning</p>
<p>But if you tell like if I were to tell myself</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna feel that way every single time I go to my new gym alpha land if I was like</p>
<p>Anticipating those emotions and those feelings every time I was gonna go it would make me not want to fucking go and I would look</p>
<p>At it like it&rsquo;s hard like goddamn. I don&rsquo;t want to fucking go work out</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like to work out is a fucking bitch in itself</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s like to psych myself out mentally and be like, well</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna feel the same way I did if I go to work out like it&rsquo;s just extra headache</p>
<p>That like you play on your own mind like you&rsquo;re telling you&rsquo;re like fucking with yourself. Does that make sense?</p>
<p>So this is my reassurance if you try something new and it&rsquo;s uncomfortable it&rsquo;s not gonna be uncomfortable forever</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna get easier</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want you to psych yourself out like that because it will make you not want to do shit</p>
<p>Like it will make things seem really really intimidating and just make you want to throw your hands up and say fuck this shit</p>
<p>Alright, I&rsquo;m not doing it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like with waking up early like if you&rsquo;re like, okay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna try and start waking up early and</p>
<p>You wake up one day and it&rsquo;s a fucking shit show and you hate it and you&rsquo;re groggy and you&rsquo;re tired</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re just like fuck this. It&rsquo;s like to think about okay. So the next month I agreed to get up early</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be like this like you know, it&rsquo;s like the catastrophizing thinking</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this experience of waking up early has been fucking hell. I want a nap my coffee didn&rsquo;t even work</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t even do anything like when you&rsquo;re at that level of like fuck this shit</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re telling yourself. Okay the whole next month. I&rsquo;m about to be waking up early. I&rsquo;m about to be feeling like this</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna want to take a fucking nap as soon as I wake up</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re instantly just gonna assume</p>
<p>based off of your first day waking up early how uncomfortable it was that it&rsquo;s gonna continue to be that</p>
<p>Uncomfortable and I&rsquo;m here to tell you it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s gonna get easier. You&rsquo;re not gonna need a nap by like day three day four</p>
<p>maybe</p>
<p>But does that all make sense?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re just your brain kind of just like assumes and sets this shit up in your head and you don&rsquo;t even realize it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>On but I just want you to like be there for yourself and learn to comfort yourself through</p>
<p>Trying new things or just doing things in general if it seems difficult</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always gonna be difficult. It will get easier and it feels bad because you&rsquo;re telling yourself something&rsquo;s fucking wrong</p>
<p>Okay, so my third little perspective theory thing this is the long one</p>
<p>This is the one I got a lot of bullet points to hit and I&rsquo;m like scrolling to my notes app right now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh, that&rsquo;s the whole way. I want to talk about it all but our phones make shit</p>
<p>so easy</p>
<p>Like everything like literally our phones make everything so fucking easy any need we have</p>
<p>We can kind of meet through our phone and we can have it quick and like instantly</p>
<p>So if you want to have discussion with somebody or like human interaction, it&rsquo;s not gonna be human interaction</p>
<p>but you can go on your phone and</p>
<p>interact with other people</p>
<p>Instantly, so if you&rsquo;re feeling alone, you&rsquo;re feeling lonely</p>
<p>You can go meet that need for yourself really quick</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s right at your fucking fingertips</p>
<p>If you want food order the shit and it&rsquo;ll be at your fucking door in 40 minutes</p>
<p>Uber Eats or whatever fucking apps there are like I don&rsquo;t use that shit</p>
<p>Like if I&rsquo;m gonna go out to eat, I&rsquo;m a goddamn go I&rsquo;m making an event</p>
<p>Like I want to go to a restaurant and sit down</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to fucking have some soggy ass food</p>
<p>Been sitting in someone&rsquo;s car for 40 fucking minutes on the way to me</p>
<p>But anyway, my point you can literally bring anything you want like quick into your experience</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t have to put really any effort into doing that</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re like before in the olden days before there was fucking phones</p>
<p>Like if you wanted to interact with a human being if you didn&rsquo;t want to feel alone</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t just get on your little fucking phone and satiate that need you would have to get up and go out and</p>
<p>Be around other human beings and talk to other people if you wanted interaction</p>
<p>The same with food if you wanted food</p>
<p>You had to get the fuck up and go out and get it</p>
<p>Like your girl you can order groceries to your goddamn fucking house</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t have to do nothing really you barely you don&rsquo;t even have to fart on your own</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s some machine that will like suck it out of your ass</p>
<p>What the fuck am I saying?</p>
<p>My point is like everything&rsquo;s just so goddamn easy like everything is just takes no effort now and</p>
<p>the fact that everything and</p>
<p>every aspect can</p>
<p>be simplified and be like</p>
<p>Sped up and then you can get it quicker. You can get it faster. You can get it now</p>
<p>Without really having to exert any effort</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of setting up a baseline in our head</p>
<p>So like when I talked about social media setting a baseline for what we think is attractive in my other episode</p>
<p>Where social media shows you hot people over and over and over again, and then you start to believe that&rsquo;s normal</p>
<p>You being able to meet needs for yourself instantly and quickly over and over and over</p>
<p>Makes it set up in your mind that the expectation is like that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s normal</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for shit to be quick right now instant. I can do it with like barely any effort</p>
<p>so there are still things in life that require a lot of effort and</p>
<p>When you start to go to do them</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna feel like fucking hell because you&rsquo;ve just been programmed that everything is quick and easy with little effort</p>
<p>So like even if you want a date</p>
<p>Like if you want to find a date</p>
<p>You can literally download an app and go meet up with someone in less than a fucking hour if you want to fuck you can</p>
<p>Download an app to go fuck somebody and literally have them at your house within an hour. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Like insane and people don&rsquo;t realize that we just like have that and we don&rsquo;t understand what the fuck like is going on</p>
<p>You know</p>
<p>Cuz we&rsquo;re before</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have if you wanted a date you had to go talk to people if you wanted to fuck somebody you had to go to</p>
<p>A bar like you had to go do things you had to put effort</p>
<p>Into anything you wanted or needed. So that&rsquo;s why people are like kind of turning against ourself</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like anything you want or need that you can&rsquo;t meet for yourself quick</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you turn against yourself for even wanting it and you get mad or annoyed or frustrated and it&rsquo;s just like fuck it</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s that frustration</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not simple but people aren&rsquo;t aware of like why things seem so goddamn hard and it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all been trained with this new generation of phones stuck up our fucking asses like literally at our fingertips</p>
<p>Anything we can have we can get it right now. Like it&rsquo;s insane. Like I ordered protein the other day</p>
<p>I literally was standing in my kitchen and I was like damn I need protein</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m out and I&rsquo;m not used to living in a big city</p>
<p>So like I got on my phone because the kind that I buy is very hard to find</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t just go to GNC and fucking buy it or like vitamin shop. They ain&rsquo;t got the shit. So I</p>
<p>Get on Amazon and it says it can be here within four hours</p>
<p>And I was like what the fuck what</p>
<p>Like I literally put in the order and then four hours later. It showed up right in my doorstep. I was like, what the hell?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m from a smaller town where that shit was not like useful</p>
<p>But now I see how a majority of people have been living for so long and I&rsquo;m like damn y&rsquo;all</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I hate your fucking lives</p>
<p>Like you think everything is that quick easy simple and so many of the best things in life are so fucking hard</p>
<p>And take so much time</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s an it&rsquo;s interesting like what I&rsquo;m observing with the ways that</p>
<p>Dynamics are set up with our phone and like accessibility to shit because I&rsquo;m not the type that&rsquo;s like complaining about it. I&rsquo;m just saying</p>
<p>understand this perspective and take it into consideration because it&rsquo;s an explanation for the way that you feel because I love that shit is</p>
<p>Convenient. I sure as fuck do I&rsquo;m not anyone to talk against technology</p>
<p>I think they need to fucking quit with the AI shit that scares the fuck out of me</p>
<p>Stop playing with robots. Stop trying to make like fake humans. That&rsquo;s fucking weird and it&rsquo;s scary</p>
<p>Have y&rsquo;all not watched any fucking movie?</p>
<p>Do y&rsquo;all not have any critical thinking skills like bitch once you give a computer? No, don&rsquo;t talk about it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not I don&rsquo;t want to speak it to into existence because I&rsquo;m ski it like that fucking shit is so scary to me like</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna blow up the world</p>
<p>Like what the fuck are you doing?</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re gonna turn on your ass don&rsquo;t give them consciousness</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fuck with computers like Amazon&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>Like just leave us with our little Amazon and our little eBay and our fucking Google like that&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to be making like robots and shit. Like I&rsquo;ll clean my own house</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need like a fucking like electric robot made. I&rsquo;m okay. I promise. I&rsquo;m okay</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t want that like that scares the fuck out of me. Stop trying to make like AI. Oh</p>
<p>My god, okay here. I keep going off a fucking tangent back on track. I</p>
<p>Appreciate</p>
<p>the like convenience of</p>
<p>Technology, but yeah, I wanted to share this perspective because it explains why shit seems so goddamn difficult and it&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>Trained to like put effort into things anymore</p>
<p>Like reading books like if someone reads books still it&rsquo;s like God Wow like round of applause</p>
<p>Like if you read a book, I&rsquo;m so like envious of you like bitch you have patience you have</p>
<p>Determination you have time and I&rsquo;m proud of you. Like that&rsquo;s a fucking like</p>
<p>Accomplishment to read a book now. I listen to them on audible and shit like audiobooks</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do that</p>
<p>But like for me to sit down and read a physical book bitch fuck no like that takes so much</p>
<p>Concentration and energy and it&rsquo;s like I want information quick and fast like I like a YouTube video</p>
<p>I like a tick-tock where they like spit that shit at me really quick and books are like diluted and</p>
<p>Long-winded and it&rsquo;s like not quick information. Like once you hit a certain awareness level nothing&rsquo;s fucking impressive and</p>
<p>Once you read so many books, it&rsquo;s the same repetitive fucking shit like most self-help books</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna they tell you for the first like two to three chapters</p>
<p>How your life is about to change and how things are gonna get better and I&rsquo;m just like motherfucker</p>
<p>Just tell me what the fuck you have to tell me stop convincing me that my life&rsquo;s gonna get so great</p>
<p>I already bought your goddamn book. So just give me the value now, like give it to me straight</p>
<p>I want it fucking force-fed like fucking just give it to me right now</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to have to read your fucking intro</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to read your preface and your goddamn two chapters of like</p>
<p>Explanation. I&rsquo;m good bitch. Just give me the information. I can handle it. I promise but right there. That&rsquo;s something also like</p>
<p>Information is so readily available all the time. Like you don&rsquo;t have to fucking</p>
<p>Struggle to learn anything. Well, you can just fucking Google it and it&rsquo;s there and</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like when I have when I can&rsquo;t find something online it pisses me off</p>
<p>Bro, like I get so fucking mad. I&rsquo;m like how the fuck has nobody like</p>
<p>Talked about this. Yeah, like my whole podcast is all the shit that I couldn&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like how the fuck are there seven billion people in the world and nobody has like</p>
<p>Talked about the shit that I talk about the way that I talk about it and like make it digestible and not like these concepts</p>
<p>Floating around in the air that sound nice and pretty but you can&rsquo;t apply it to reality like bitch</p>
<p>How has nobody done this? I&rsquo;d like it aggravates the living shit out of me when I can&rsquo;t find something but that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>Conditioned that everything is like right there easy accessible</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s been done by somebody like nowadays you can&rsquo;t find shit that someone else hasn&rsquo;t done</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why it was so frustrating for me to try to find what I&rsquo;m creating</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the thing also</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s doing everything like so everything has already been basically fucking done in one way or another</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird. Like if you have an idea now for something to make or an invention or anything</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like someone has already thought of it and put it into action unless it&rsquo;s something like very far-fetched like very</p>
<p>specific that no one&rsquo;s like put time or effort into but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not really a problem without a solution anymore</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s always I don&rsquo;t is that the thing?</p>
<p>So like when I have a problem that I can&rsquo;t solve it pisses me off because I&rsquo;m used to it being solved</p>
<p>There we go. That makes sense</p>
<p>You hear my brain turning the little mouse is running in my brain like it&rsquo;s on its little wheel and it&rsquo;s running</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s turning like things are making sense</p>
<p>But another thing I want to talk about is like being entertained</p>
<p>like if you have any moment of</p>
<p>Boredom like you don&rsquo;t have to like sit with yourself and sit in your thoughts or try to think of a way to entertain yourself</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you just pull out your little phone and you play on an app and you&rsquo;re entertained</p>
<p>Forever like tick-tock bitch. I could stay on it forever and like never be bored. I really I&rsquo;d have to pee or something but like</p>
<p>Tick-tock like an Instagram and like social media. It&rsquo;s just so easy to be entertained and distracted. It&rsquo;s right there. So</p>
<p>People in the olden days you&rsquo;d say you still have to go the fucking movie theater or like if you wanted to hear music you</p>
<p>Had to go to a concert bitch</p>
<p>like now you just play anything you goddamn want like you just play anything you want at any moment at any time and</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. Like that&rsquo;s just another little thing. I wanted to point out but my biggest point about this is</p>
<p>If you are feeling a way that you do not want to feel or you&rsquo;re feeling something uncomfortable</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>airquote quick fixes out</p>
<p>there so like</p>
<p>distraction being one like getting on your phone and playing on something that&rsquo;s a distraction from your current reality of the current things you&rsquo;re feeling and</p>
<p>Facing you got drugs and alcohol and if you don&rsquo;t want to go to a store order them text your fucking plug</p>
<p>Drop them in my mailbox bitch</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s so many ways to get things so quickly to you that like in order to not feel the way that you do</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so easy. It&rsquo;s so fast. Whereas before people were sat down and like made</p>
<p>To sit in the way that they felt like if they wanted to distract their self</p>
<p>It took a lot more effort and energy like people were a lot more in touch</p>
<p>I believe a long time ago cuz like the shit that I&rsquo;m observing now in the world is some asleep ass</p>
<p>Snoring ass shit, like everyone is so out of touch with herself and it&rsquo;s insane</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re out of touch with their self the people around them and the fucking world like bro</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the whole thing is like you don&rsquo;t have to sit with yourself anymore</p>
<p>So, how are you ever supposed to get in touch with yourself? Like you&rsquo;re able to just distract yourself</p>
<p>Instantly and all these apps are so fucking addictive that like even if you don&rsquo;t plan on</p>
<p>Getting on one like if you just like you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re habitually trained to click an app</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like if you start moving the icons around on your phone</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll realize your finger automatically clicks to Instagram or clicks the tick-tock or clicks to snapchat or like whatever it is</p>
<p>Like whatever you fucking get on all the time like your brain just like clicks on it automatically</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something fucking weird that I&rsquo;ve like started thinking about a lot is like people can instantly</p>
<p>Not feel the way that they feel</p>
<p>one the way that I do it is</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m feeling something, I don&rsquo;t want to feel I always it&rsquo;s like a bad little trait of mine</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m supposed to give myself attention and like focus on myself, but to be honest all the time</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to fucking do that. Like I&rsquo;m so goddamn fucking needy</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, can I just not like I&rsquo;m tired. I haven&rsquo;t a comfort myself, bitch</p>
<p>so I just jump online and I try to look for a new perspective about what I&rsquo;m going through and</p>
<p>That will change the way that I feel about it</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s something I do a lot and that&rsquo;s another reason that I made this podcast is because I ran out of places and</p>
<p>Perspectives to look for so I started sharing them so y&rsquo;all can do it. But that&rsquo;s my thing is I might be gaining awareness and</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great and all like I&rsquo;m waking up and I&rsquo;m growing I&rsquo;m seeing new perspectives, but I&rsquo;m still not sitting with myself</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still distracting myself with the new perspective. I just gained so that makes sense. Like everything is pulling us away from ourself</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s so easy to get away from yourself and the way that you&rsquo;re feeling like it&rsquo;s so insanely easy that it&rsquo;s kind of scary</p>
<p>But something that makes shit seem hard is when you can&rsquo;t use your phone</p>
<p>Like if you try to go live a day without your phone</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be sitting there forced to face how you&rsquo;re feeling and it&rsquo;s gonna fuck with everything. So like going to the gym</p>
<p>Whenever I&rsquo;m not feeling motivated</p>
<p>Instead of having to sit in that and work through that on my own to get myself to get up and go to the gym</p>
<p>I can put on a good song</p>
<p>I can look at people online that makes me insecure and like looks better than me</p>
<p>So I want to go or I can fucking</p>
<p>Watch a YouTube video and see someone that is inspiring to me like there&rsquo;s so many ways</p>
<p>To deal with the emotions that come up throughout the day that it makes it so easy</p>
<p>Like but if I didn&rsquo;t have my phone and I had to like find motivation, it would be a lot harder</p>
<p>Does that make sense like so shit seems so fucking difficult when you can&rsquo;t use the typical things that we use</p>
<p>To help ourself. So that&rsquo;s just another random perspective with all this</p>
<p>But I do want to say if you&rsquo;ve made it this far in the podcast</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not done yet, but I am gonna ask you to leave me a 5 star rating</p>
<p>And if you made it this far</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to give it anything less than 5 stars cuz bitch you really invested in this episode of you this fucking far</p>
<p>So go ahead and give my love 5 stars cuz I&rsquo;m entertaining you you&rsquo;re still here. Thank you so much</p>
<p>But another example of this that&rsquo;s like fucked me up is trying to find furniture, bro</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve talked about it before my taste is so fucking picky and I don&rsquo;t like anything</p>
<p>So trying to find furniture, like I&rsquo;m used to just being able to go on Amazon when I want something and buying it</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>When I tried to do that</p>
<p>With furniture, I can&rsquo;t like I can&rsquo;t find shit on Amazon. I can&rsquo;t find shit at IKEA</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t find shit anywhere like I had to physically</p>
<p>go to a bunch of different antique shops to find the things that I want and</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taken like a lot of effort and work and I&rsquo;m hunting like I&rsquo;m on the fucking prowl for some furniture I like</p>
<p>When I first moved in I got a bunch of shit from Goodwill</p>
<p>Like I got a couch and a table from Goodwill in a little chair because I was like, okay great</p>
<p>This is enough to like move me in and get me like livable until I can actually find something</p>
<p>I love then I&rsquo;ll like</p>
<p>drop some cash on it and I just found a table that I love and if you follow me on Instagram then you already saw</p>
<p>The table and tick-tock I posted on there, too</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so excited about it</p>
<p>But I finally found the table and now I get to get rid of the Goodwill one</p>
<p>But I spent so much on that goddamn table. Oh my god, it makes me fucking sick. But I do love it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from the 70s and it&rsquo;s real pretty</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve had to like check myself with trying to look for furniture</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve been looking at it and telling myself this is so hard for no reason like</p>
<p>Why the fuck am I not able to find what I want at places and I&rsquo;m like Leo</p>
<p>Hello like, you know, you don&rsquo;t like normal shit</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re trying to find special things in normal places. I&rsquo;ve talked about that before but</p>
<p>Telling myself it should be easy and then experiencing it being difficult</p>
<p>Pissed me off ten times worse and made the experience even worse</p>
<p>So I have to check myself a lot mentally like y&rsquo;all aren&rsquo;t the only ones that have to do it</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m constantly on my own ass like having to call myself out and</p>
<p>Check the assumptions that I make and watch the shit that I speak over myself</p>
<p>Cuz it&rsquo;s not been hard to find furniture</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve just had to go to a lot of places like I&rsquo;ve had to put a lot more effort into finding things</p>
<p>Then I usually do because I can just find it online real quick. But that&rsquo;s the thing is I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>Doing something that&rsquo;s extremely hard</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just having to put more effort into it than just tapping some fucking buttons on a computer</p>
<p>Or like tapping the screen on my phone and then having it show up and be delivered</p>
<p>Me telling myself that that was hard and that was difficult is what made me feel like it was difficult</p>
<p>but once I told myself, okay, you&rsquo;re looking for a bunch of special shit and</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re putting in the expected amount of effort like the amount of effort</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taking from you to find the things that you want is normal</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the expected level of effort it takes to find what you&rsquo;re looking for</p>
<p>So watching the meanings I assigned to that shit made it seem a lot easier</p>
<p>Cuz once I put myself off the hook, I was like look Leo like you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>Exerting extra effort like you&rsquo;re actually doing the normal amount like this is not actually that difficult</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not what you&rsquo;re used to</p>
<p>That set me the fuck free and it made me kind of enjoy this little hunt now because I wanted it fast quick now</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s taken me a month to find some shit that I actually really like</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not really that long because the things that I want are very specific and special. So</p>
<p>The amount of effort I&rsquo;ve put in hasn&rsquo;t been awful, you know</p>
<p>But that kind of brings me back to point one with the expectations thing</p>
<p>Look at what you&rsquo;re going through and look at what you&rsquo;re dealing with and check yourself. Are you actually working that hard?</p>
<p>Are you actually like having to put in too much effort?</p>
<p>Is it actually difficult or is it just more difficult than what you&rsquo;re used to because everything is so fucking easy now</p>
<p>That was a pretty goddamn good question. Damn. I&rsquo;m gonna leave it off on there</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna shut the fuck up and just in the episode here before I start like</p>
<p>Going too much ruining that cuz that was a really good point</p>
<p>Once again, I&rsquo;m gonna ask you to leave me a five-star rating in case you forgot cuz now we&rsquo;re at the end</p>
<p>I have to remind you. Thank you so much</p>
<p>Love you so much</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s for and where I specialize is with the people that have been looking for answers</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t find and the people that have been trying shit and it&rsquo;s just not working</p>
