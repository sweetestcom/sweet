    <p>‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Hardcore History.</p>
<p>Attention.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>So, the origin story for the conversation</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re about to hear is that I was on a panel</p>
<p>with the upcoming guest,</p>
<p>and as we were departing the panel,</p>
<p>he leans in and whispers in my ear,</p>
<p>we should talk about asymmetrical warfare</p>
<p>sometime on your show.</p>
<p>And as many of you know, I&rsquo;m a sucker</p>
<p>for romantic talk like that.</p>
<p>So, we set it up, and we had the conversation,</p>
<p>I should point out, back on December 14th, 2021.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;ve held this for a little while,</p>
<p>which might mean if somewhere in the timeline</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s anything that seems a little strange to you,</p>
<p>that might be why.</p>
<p>Although, I didn&rsquo;t notice anything,</p>
<p>but I tend to miss stuff, especially when I&rsquo;m as deep</p>
<p>into the Hardcore History weeds as I am right now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of mental issues</p>
<p>that the host has at the moment.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know how to describe the guest</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s upcoming, because he&rsquo;s done so many things</p>
<p>in so many different areas.</p>
<p>Actor, author, writer, senior fellow</p>
<p>at the Modern War Institute at West Point,</p>
<p>and writes about zombies.</p>
<p>He is the author of World War Z.</p>
<p>He was a comedy writer at Saturday Night Live.</p>
<p>His father and mother are both probably known to you.</p>
<p>His dad&rsquo;s Mel Brooks, his mother&rsquo;s Anne Bancroft.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fantastically interesting individual.</p>
<p>I enjoyed my conversation with him immensely.</p>
<p>So, for the next hour and a half,</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the conversation as much as I did</p>
<p>that we had with Max Brooks.</p>
<p>Max Brooks, thank you so much for coming on the program.</p>
<p>Um, why don&rsquo;t we start with your definition,</p>
<p>since you brought it up, thought we should talk</p>
<p>a little bit about asymmetrical warfare.</p>
<p>Tell me what your definition</p>
<p>of asymmetrical warfare is, and why you think</p>
<p>people should know about it.</p>
<p>Yes, well, my version of it is, uh, as Clausewitz</p>
<p>once called war politics by other means,</p>
<p>I call asymmetry war by other means.</p>
<p>Uh, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it doesn&rsquo;t include violence,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not exclusive state violence.</p>
<p>And what I mean is, uh, the traditional definition</p>
<p>of war is that you have Army A on one side</p>
<p>and Army B on the other side, and they go at it</p>
<p>on a chosen battlefield, and whoever wins, wins the war.</p>
<p>And asymmetry is using every other means possible</p>
<p>in order to achieve your goal, which is, could be anything.</p>
<p>Uh, and so I think the reason I wanted to talk to you</p>
<p>about it today is because I think America&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of at a crossroads, and we need to remember</p>
<p>that fighting in what the military calls</p>
<p>the gray zone is nothing new. It&rsquo;s a very old way of fighting,</p>
<p>but we have sort of forgotten that because we&rsquo;ve gotten</p>
<p>really, really, really, really good at sanitized,</p>
<p>conventional conflict, and we need to get back</p>
<p>to the gray zone.</p>
<p>So, I was looking at the, uh, list of hardcore history shows</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve done, and the second one, so show number two,</p>
<p>was essentially about asymmetrical warfare,</p>
<p>uh, the West and field battles and that mentality</p>
<p>versus the East and guerrilla warfare</p>
<p>and wearing down and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>We couched it in terms of the West and the East,</p>
<p>more like a Persia-Greece sort of thing,</p>
<p>but now everybody practices all these.</p>
<p>I mean, these are in everybody&rsquo;s playbooks, right?</p>
<p>Everybody knows about field battles,</p>
<p>everybody knows about, um, you know,</p>
<p>I had a teacher once who described</p>
<p>asymmetrical warfare as everything other than</p>
<p>field battles. Um, and so, everybody knows</p>
<p>about those kinds of things. Now, if you&rsquo;re going to fight,</p>
<p>uh, the strongest military power in the world,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna say we still are the strongest military power</p>
<p>in the world, you don&rsquo;t wanna fight somebody like that</p>
<p>conventionally, right? Wouldn&rsquo;t the asymmetrical,</p>
<p>uh, method be the smart way to do something like that?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, and I think, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the perfect guy to talk to about this</p>
<p>because this is recent history for all of us,</p>
<p>whether we realize it or not, and it all goes back</p>
<p>to a recent war we fought, which I consider</p>
<p>to be the worst war we ever fought,</p>
<p>which was Desert Storm.</p>
<p>Now, why do you consider Desert Storm</p>
<p>to be the worst war we ever fought?</p>
<p>Uh, because it&rsquo;s not about, as in life,</p>
<p>life is not about the experiences we have,</p>
<p>life is about what we take from them.</p>
<p>And you know this, this is just being a person.</p>
<p>We know people who have had incredible life experiences,</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t learned a damn thing.</p>
<p>And are the exact same person they were 20 years ago.</p>
<p>And they keep wondering why, uh, things keep happening to them.</p>
<p>And they haven&rsquo;t learned.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the problem with Desert Storm,</p>
<p>was we fought this war,</p>
<p>specifically as a war of deterrence.</p>
<p>The world was changing, the Soviet Union was crumbling,</p>
<p>uh, America was sort of stepping onto the world stage</p>
<p>as the only superpower left.</p>
<p>And we thought the best way to deter future aggression,</p>
<p>you know, up-and-coming challengers,</p>
<p>was to have a very public, very conventional,</p>
<p>big, mechanized, expensive conflict.</p>
<p>Uh, and we did that. We did that with the Iraqi army,</p>
<p>which both sides hyped up the fact that it was one</p>
<p>of the biggest armies in the world, at least on paper.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we invited this brand new, uh,</p>
<p>fledgling company, CNN, you know, 24-hour cable news,</p>
<p>to cover the war.</p>
<p>Because we wanted everyone to see us just utterly pulverize</p>
<p>this massive army.</p>
<p>And we thought that would deter aggression.</p>
<p>We thought that if we said,</p>
<p>listen, if you mess with America on the battlefield,</p>
<p>we will smash you into atoms.</p>
<p>What we didn&rsquo;t realize was what we were teaching</p>
<p>all our future competitors was,</p>
<p>if you are going to mess with America,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t go anywhere near the battlefield.</p>
<p>Find alternative means.</p>
<p>And our enemies have been developing asymmetric means.</p>
<p>Whereas we keep gearing up,</p>
<p>despite what happened in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still gearing up for the next desert storm.</p>
<p>So, here&rsquo;s what&hellip; So, I think I take away</p>
<p>a little bit differently the recent history,</p>
<p>only because I see it more as a continuum.</p>
<p>Um, I mean, so, it&rsquo;s funny, because as you get older,</p>
<p>ten years starts seeming like not that much time.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, it seemed like half my life</p>
<p>when I was 20, because it was.</p>
<p>But you think about the time period,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go between like 1975,</p>
<p>the year the Vietnam War officially ended,</p>
<p>and 1985, when the new American military,</p>
<p>it really is gonna be debuted against</p>
<p>Manuel Noriega in Panama, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna see stealth technology debut there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna see a bunch of other different elements</p>
<p>debut there. Uh, maybe call that a warm-up</p>
<p>or a test case for, uh, desert&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay. So, uh, so, to me, that ten-year period,</p>
<p>including things like the impact of people</p>
<p>who were junior officers in Vietnam,</p>
<p>like Colin Powell and the people who&rsquo;d ridden</p>
<p>through the ranks, Schwarzkopf, all those guys,</p>
<p>was to create sort of a different sort of mentality,</p>
<p>different kind of warfare.</p>
<p>Uh, certainly, these guys, having been through Vietnam</p>
<p>on the ground, would&rsquo;ve understood</p>
<p>the challenges of asymmetrical warfare.</p>
<p>Do you tend to&hellip; Is there a bureaucracy involved</p>
<p>where you tend to want to focus on the big things</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where&hellip; I mean, not to change subjects here,</p>
<p>but I mean, I remember talking about submarines</p>
<p>and the Japanese military, the Navy in the Second World War,</p>
<p>and the literal excuse for why they didn&rsquo;t care more</p>
<p>about it was, the guys who would have to study it,</p>
<p>the junior officers, didn&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>They want to study big fleet battles</p>
<p>and decisive things. Is there some sort of, um,</p>
<p>call it a bureaucratic, um, um, um, uh, bias</p>
<p>towards those sorts of things?</p>
<p>Whereas, things like asymmetrical warfare</p>
<p>seems like small potatoes by comparison,</p>
<p>not very exciting?</p>
<p>I think so, and I think it&rsquo;s a combination</p>
<p>of culture and money.</p>
<p>And so, you would think, coming out of Vietnam,</p>
<p>that we would&rsquo;ve come out of that war</p>
<p>with the absolute best guerrilla warfare school</p>
<p>the world has ever seen.</p>
<p>Because we used to be good at things like that.</p>
<p>We would come out of these wars,</p>
<p>and we would learn incredible lessons.</p>
<p>We came out of the Civil War understanding</p>
<p>that the U.S. Army had to be professionalized.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t just elect your officers anymore.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t just appoint an officer</p>
<p>because his dad had made a campaign contribution.</p>
<p>The Army had to be professional.</p>
<p>Uh, we came out of wars like World War I and World War II</p>
<p>understanding these new technologies</p>
<p>like air power, uh, tank warfare,</p>
<p>even things like snipers.</p>
<p>These things had to be institutionalized.</p>
<p>But then you come out of Vietnam,</p>
<p>and you see this gravity back to our comfort zone,</p>
<p>back to the Fold the Gap,</p>
<p>uh, back to the idea that Vietnam was a one-off,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll never have to fight that again.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where you get into, uh,</p>
<p>the psychological disaster of Desert Storm.</p>
<p>The idea that Desert Storm was a return to how wars</p>
<p>will be fought and should be fought,</p>
<p>as opposed to what it really was,</p>
<p>which was a dying breed.</p>
<p>That it was a last gasp of the old ways of fighting.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why you get into this problem.</p>
<p>You know, being a fellow at the Modern War Institute</p>
<p>and meeting these mid-grade officers</p>
<p>who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan,</p>
<p>I got this understanding of how little has been studied</p>
<p>about exactly what they were going into.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of the guys that I know</p>
<p>who went into Afghanistan,</p>
<p>they had no books about Afghanistan.</p>
<p>They had the bear went over the mountain.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t indoctrinated to study even the Afghan War,</p>
<p>uh, the Soviet War in Afghanistan,</p>
<p>uh, guerrilla warfare in Iraq.</p>
<p>I mean, I always said the day that we got out of Saigon,</p>
<p>if I had been Secretary of Defense,</p>
<p>I would have given General Bowen Japp a check</p>
<p>for a million dollars to come and be a professor</p>
<p>at West Point and teach us everything.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s what we used to do.</p>
<p>When somebody would give us a run for our money,</p>
<p>after the war, we&rsquo;d invite them in.</p>
<p>We had a lot of ex-U-Boat commanders, uh,</p>
<p>helping us prepare for an underwater war</p>
<p>against the Soviets.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a funny thing, though,</p>
<p>because I, you feel, to take some of the pressure</p>
<p>off of our planners and military,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re in a little bit of a bind here,</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have the option of deciding,</p>
<p>as you know, Max, I don&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;m telling you</p>
<p>anything you don&rsquo;t know, but they have to plan</p>
<p>for both eventualities, don&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;re not going to get into</p>
<p>some weird sort of war in, um, in, in, in Asia right now,</p>
<p>off the coast, maybe in a, in a Taiwan defense situation.</p>
<p>In other words, you don&rsquo;t know what the enemy&rsquo;s going to do</p>
<p>or what the situation is going to develop into.</p>
<p>You have to sort of be prepared for everything.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a Sun Tzu quality, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>That defense everywhere is like not having defense anywhere.</p>
<p>But, but you kind of have to be ready for 9-11</p>
<p>or World War III, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>You do. And this, this is why I said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just about culture, it&rsquo;s also about</p>
<p>money because there is, there is a center of gravity,</p>
<p>which is the military industrial complex.</p>
<p>Right. There&rsquo;s a tail wagging the dog thing.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need more tanks for the military,</p>
<p>but the Georgia district where they make them</p>
<p>needs them, that kind of dynamic, right?</p>
<p>Right. And in which you actually have</p>
<p>General Ray O&rsquo;Dierno speaking to Congress saying,</p>
<p>we do not need any more tanks.</p>
<p>You know, if you think about the amount of money</p>
<p>we shoveled into things like laser weaponry</p>
<p>during the Iraq war and trying to retrofit them on Hummers</p>
<p>so we could shoot IEDs with a laser beam to blow it up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s big money at work.</p>
<p>Compare that to the fact that in 20 years in Afghanistan,</p>
<p>20 years, Dan, we never had a witness protection program</p>
<p>for our Afghan allies in which a massive amount</p>
<p>of our casualties were guys being shot</p>
<p>by their Afghan opposite numbers</p>
<p>because the Taliban would threaten their families.</p>
<p>Now there should have been a program where those guys,</p>
<p>the moment they get the call from the Taliban,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to kill your family.</p>
<p>Unless you kill an American, he should have been able</p>
<p>to go to his American opposite number, tell him</p>
<p>the American should have said, well,</p>
<p>we have a program in place.</p>
<p>You can come on base. Your family is safe.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>Not once did we ever have that program.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not where the big money was.</p>
<p>The big money was in putting a laser on a 747</p>
<p>to knock off the one ballistic missile</p>
<p>that Kim Jong-un might fire someday.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the vulnerability then</p>
<p>that opens the door to the Ace Amendment.</p>
<p>That opens the door to the asymmetrical warfare, right?</p>
<p>Because the more you invest at that very high level,</p>
<p>the more things aren&rsquo;t being handled</p>
<p>at the very low level, leaving vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s so weird, though, Max, is as you had said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve fought enough of these things.</p>
<p>I mean, since the Second World War,</p>
<p>this has been the main kind of warfare</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve actually engaged in.</p>
<p>You would think that by now this would be institutionalized.</p>
<p>And yet we still follow in the same sort of pattern</p>
<p>that you can see.</p>
<p>I mean, I love the Roman legions</p>
<p>because they would start off when they first formed them,</p>
<p>you know, made up of the conscripts.</p>
<p>And they would form, and they wouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>they would be totally green and not very good.</p>
<p>Then they would work themselves over time</p>
<p>into this fantastic fighting machine.</p>
<p>And then they would disband at the end of the conflict</p>
<p>and lose all the institutional memory that they had built up.</p>
<p>And I feel like that&rsquo;s our pattern, too.</p>
<p>I mean, when you fought Korea, Vietnam,</p>
<p>innumerable small sorts of things,</p>
<p>you would think we would have this figured out by now.</p>
<p>And you know what&rsquo;s also funny,</p>
<p>and you know this better than I do, Max,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve met enough of these officers to know</p>
<p>that this has to be one of the most well-read,</p>
<p>intellectually curious, historically minded</p>
<p>group of commanders that I&rsquo;ve ever encountered.</p>
<p>I mean, they totally buck the trend of the sort of the</p>
<p>stuck in the last war military mentality.</p>
<p>So if that&rsquo;s the case, you would think</p>
<p>that we would be specifically excelling at things</p>
<p>like learning from past experience.</p>
<p>Why do you think that&rsquo;s not helping more than it is?</p>
<p>This is one of the issues I think we&rsquo;re coming up against,</p>
<p>is, like you said, the officers that I have known</p>
<p>at the Modern War Institute, the mid-graders,</p>
<p>the captains and the majors, they&rsquo;ve all been through it.</p>
<p>And they know the old system doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>They are insanely curious.</p>
<p>A good friend of mine, John Spencer,</p>
<p>recently retired from the Army, he</p>
<p>is the preeminent scholar in urban warfare.</p>
<p>And on his desk is a little disc, a copper disc.</p>
<p>And he said, this is the primary mechanism</p>
<p>inside the Iranian IED that killed a lot of my friends.</p>
<p>And behind him on the wall is an AK-47.</p>
<p>He said, that killed the rest of them.</p>
<p>And he said, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what killed them.</p>
<p>Nothing high tech.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an example of how these guys are very much aware</p>
<p>of how wars are being fought.</p>
<p>But the problem is, they are, I think, like we said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re arrayed against culture.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also arrayed against, like we said, big money,</p>
<p>the military-industrial complex.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s also a third element in this triumvirate,</p>
<p>which is geography.</p>
<p>Because we are safe, because the wars we fight</p>
<p>are not existential wars.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s enough of an honest-to-God threat</p>
<p>that burns through the fog.</p>
<p>I think because we think that our wars</p>
<p>can be wars of choice, then we might</p>
<p>have the choice never to fight another Iraq or Afghanistan.</p>
<p>We can delude ourselves into thinking that the next war</p>
<p>can be desert storm, because we will choose the time and place.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the typical hubris that goes back forever.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting, because in my, you know,</p>
<p>if you think about yourself like a science fiction</p>
<p>supervillain, right, or the Joker, or somebody like that,</p>
<p>you can see, I would think, that we&rsquo;re much more vulnerable,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re talking about, you had mentioned,</p>
<p>existential threats, right, a threat to your existence.</p>
<p>Other than nuclear weapons, I think</p>
<p>the most logical threat to our existence</p>
<p>is having some program, and I&rsquo;m sure the Russians are doing</p>
<p>this, but I bet everybody&rsquo;s doing this,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve got paid people who are going on message</p>
<p>boards in the United States and helping to rip the country</p>
<p>apart from within, which I would argue,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re much more vulnerable to something like that right now</p>
<p>than anybody launching a serious ground</p>
<p>war anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>And yet, that&rsquo;s not very sexy if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in the halls of military academia</p>
<p>studying, you know, potential war scenarios.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the one you necessarily</p>
<p>want to be working on, but I would</p>
<p>argue that except for the nuclear weapon</p>
<p>threat, which never goes away, and the longer we don&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about it, the more we just become inured to it,</p>
<p>that would be the next level, is simply being torn apart</p>
<p>by what Max Brooks has labeled correctly,</p>
<p>asymmetrical warfare.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll go one even farther.</p>
<p>We knew, we knew years ago that the Russians were putting bots</p>
<p>on medical websites to begin to debate vaccines.</p>
<p>And they would put them on both sides, by the way.</p>
<p>You would have debates being waged by bots pretending</p>
<p>to be regular Americans debating about vaccines,</p>
<p>and that was to sow doubt.</p>
<p>And that was way before COVID.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure years from now, you and I</p>
<p>will be doing a podcast about some historian who</p>
<p>will do a deep dive into how much that attack on our trust</p>
<p>in vaccines contributed to the deaths suffered by COVID.</p>
<p>You know, Max, though, here&rsquo;s an interesting thing that</p>
<p>reminds me of some of the nuclear brinksmanship-type</p>
<p>debates they used to have at places like RAND,</p>
<p>where they would ask about countries exploiting the fact</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t want to launch World War III,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ll just take a little bit of territory</p>
<p>and see if you&rsquo;re willing to use nukes for something</p>
<p>as minor as that.</p>
<p>I feel like things like bots in cyberspace tearing apart</p>
<p>your national cohesiveness are one of those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re not going to launch a war, for example,</p>
<p>with Putin&rsquo;s Russia over that, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like invading Latvia might have been.</p>
<p>But at the same time, certainly you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t just let that stuff fester if it&rsquo;s as dangerous</p>
<p>as we just said it is.</p>
<p>It almost seems to me like the kind of thing</p>
<p>that you would, that in the old days during the Cold War,</p>
<p>you would have addressed in some sort of summit agreement</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re exactly right.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m glad you used nukes, because the thing</p>
<p>about human psychology is, you and I both know,</p>
<p>the human mind has a problem with imagination.</p>
<p>For all our imagination, we still</p>
<p>have difficulty thinking about things</p>
<p>until they&rsquo;re right in front of our face.</p>
<p>And the reason that we had such incredible diplomacy</p>
<p>and legality when it came to the use of nukes, right?</p>
<p>Who keeps them?</p>
<p>Who gets them?</p>
<p>How do they use?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the oversight?</p>
<p>What are the treaty stipulations surrounding them?</p>
<p>I mean, the legislation would fill a library</p>
<p>about nuclear weapons because we saw them used.</p>
<p>And you couldn&rsquo;t argue with them.</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t take much for the human mind</p>
<p>to look at Hiroshima and Nagasaki</p>
<p>and picture the rest of the world.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t tell me that Kennedy and Khrushchev</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have those images in the front of their brains</p>
<p>when they were negotiating over Cuba.</p>
<p>But the new threats that we have,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t seen something like Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>
<p>Take, for example, cyber warfare.</p>
<p>I did an article, I wrote an article on this</p>
<p>a little while ago, speaking to a friend of mine</p>
<p>in Cyber Command, who said that we have all the tools</p>
<p>to stop cyber warfare.</p>
<p>What we don&rsquo;t have is doctrine.</p>
<p>We never got to that phase like we did with nukes,</p>
<p>where you get in generals and lawyers and diplomats</p>
<p>and really sit down and order pizza and beer</p>
<p>and stay up all night and hammer out agreements</p>
<p>about this new power, which is cyber warfare.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>I always use the example, what if, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>Russian hackers hijack data in a hospital, right?</p>
<p>And all they want is money.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not working for the Russian government.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just taking the money.</p>
<p>But while they&rsquo;re holding that data for ransom,</p>
<p>people are not getting their prescriptions.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re dying.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s murder or manslaughter.</p>
<p>How would you judge this?</p>
<p>Is that murder?</p>
<p>Is it manslaughter?</p>
<p>And then if the Russians don&rsquo;t turn over these killers,</p>
<p>is that any different than the Taliban</p>
<p>harboring Osama bin Laden?</p>
<p>And if that attack on the hospital is a NATO ally,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that Article 5?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that an attack on the citizens&rsquo; lives of a NATO ally?</p>
<p>So this is what I mean.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a cohesive doctrine</p>
<p>to tell us what is a cyber crime versus a cyber act of war.</p>
<p>Reminds one of sort of like letters of Mark or something,</p>
<p>allowing plausible deniability.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s the other thing when</p>
<p>you compare it to nukes, too.</p>
<p>With nukes, you&rsquo;re talking about physical things,</p>
<p>the possession of which can be seen, photographed, studied,</p>
<p>assessed, movements of which can be followed.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re talking about somebody who can just quickly</p>
<p>sign on into cyberspace anywhere in the world,</p>
<p>push a button that begins a process,</p>
<p>then sign off, throw the phone away, and run.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel like the plausible deniability</p>
<p>reaches new levels of deniability,</p>
<p>if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Well, you know, Eisenhower made a wonderful speech</p>
<p>during the nuclear age about how our power was</p>
<p>exceeding our wisdom, and how we had to catch up.</p>
<p>I love that one, by the way, yeah.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t that a great one?</p>
<p>Oh, my god.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a future shock type statement by Eisenhower,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>He got it.</p>
<p>He understood that, wait a minute, we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>unleashed all this power.</p>
<p>We need to now get in front of it.</p>
<p>We need to build a fireplace around this fire</p>
<p>before the fire burns down our house.</p>
<p>But we haven&rsquo;t done that with anything else.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the problem, because these new sources</p>
<p>of power, like cyber or like the internet,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so insidious, you don&rsquo;t see the immediate threat</p>
<p>until it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re starting to see it, and we need to catch up.</p>
<p>So this is where free societies are at a bit</p>
<p>of a disadvantage, perhaps.</p>
<p>So you look at these states who see, you know,</p>
<p>we always make it sound like the reason that states</p>
<p>like Iran, for example, or China are threatened</p>
<p>by the internet is because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>threatened by openness.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re threatened by it, too.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not threatened by the openness.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re threatened simply by the fact</p>
<p>that, you know, we used to be scared</p>
<p>about the anarchist cookbook information getting online.</p>
<p>And something like that&rsquo;s ridiculous now, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like we used to be scared, or the Soviets used</p>
<p>to be scared, about one radio signal, Radio Free Europe,</p>
<p>coming over the Iron Curtain and what</p>
<p>that one radio signal of propaganda might do.</p>
<p>Can you imagine trying to have the Cold War with the internet?</p>
<p>I mean, so I feel like there&rsquo;s this ability that regimes that</p>
<p>are more authoritarian and can cloak</p>
<p>the curtailing of civil liberties and the freedom</p>
<p>to go online and read what you want</p>
<p>in terms that sound like patriotic, self-defense,</p>
<p>protect yourself from the invasive enemy outside.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel like they have more of an ability</p>
<p>to close that loophole or that hole in their defenses</p>
<p>than we do, because in our society, it&rsquo;s not just a bug,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also a feature.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Yes, and you know, but what&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>is that in the short term, they have an advantage,</p>
<p>but only in the short term.</p>
<p>Because in the long term, our advantage</p>
<p>is our openness and our ability to have these messy debates</p>
<p>and the ability to inoculate ourselves</p>
<p>from these kinds of viruses.</p>
<p>See, the idea is that in a free and open society,</p>
<p>you have more chaos.</p>
<p>But in the chaos, you self-correct, right?</p>
<p>You elect different people.</p>
<p>You change the laws.</p>
<p>You try a law out.</p>
<p>The law doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>You change it.</p>
<p>Or the law goes too far.</p>
<p>You pull it back.</p>
<p>I mean, that is the story of Western democracies,</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re always sort of shifting that line.</p>
<p>And in the short term, yes, it&rsquo;s much more chaotic.</p>
<p>But it builds a more durable society,</p>
<p>as opposed to, say, the People&rsquo;s Republic of China,</p>
<p>where in the short term, it&rsquo;s peace.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s peace built on a fragile absolutism,</p>
<p>where the moment a problem leaks in,</p>
<p>you have no mechanism to self-correct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s either perfection or it&rsquo;s the end.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why they have to shut things off.</p>
<p>I mean, any society that is afraid of debate</p>
<p>is a society that is doomed eventually to failure.</p>
<p>And we saw that.</p>
<p>We saw that with the Cold War, that they</p>
<p>had to wall themselves off.</p>
<p>Because the moment free ideas, freedom, and expression,</p>
<p>and arguments came in, they had no mechanism</p>
<p>for controlling it and for inoculating themselves.</p>
<p>And the system collapsed.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll take a little bit of short-term chaos</p>
<p>any day for a little bit of long-term durability.</p>
<p>You know, you and I are, I&rsquo;m a little older than you,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re almost the same age.</p>
<p>That, to me, is the argument we always grew up with, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the old free society versus closed society,</p>
<p>pros and cons argument.</p>
<p>I feel like some of the variables, some</p>
<p>of the things we&rsquo;ve already discussed here,</p>
<p>may impact, though, that received conventional wisdom</p>
<p>that we both grew up with.</p>
<p>For example, it&rsquo;s almost like a jujitsu kind of thing,</p>
<p>where you were just talking about the arguments that</p>
<p>keep us healthy and allow us to self-correct in our society.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s almost like when we talk</p>
<p>about these bots or the ability to undermine our society</p>
<p>from within, acting as though you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>American citizens having political debates on message</p>
<p>boards or in the comments after news stories,</p>
<p>I mean, that you would say is a feature 35 years ago</p>
<p>of our strength in the debates and all this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Now it seems to me almost something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s turned against us.</p>
<p>I feel like the debates that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been having in this country is what&rsquo;s ripped us apart.</p>
<p>And if those debates have actually</p>
<p>been prompted by our adversaries or international competitors,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;ve taken that advantage</p>
<p>that you and I grew up with calling a feature</p>
<p>and turned it into a bug.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>But I would argue that it means that we</p>
<p>need to have better debates.</p>
<p>We need to have all the facts at our disposal.</p>
<p>Like, for example, when I go on Twitter,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m sure when you go on Twitter, right,</p>
<p>we need to have a check next to our name</p>
<p>to make sure we are who we are.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t have that, Max.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I have to have that.</p>
<p>Preaching to the wrong guy here.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>But I had to do that, you know, the same way</p>
<p>I had to do that on Facebook.</p>
<p>But the average person doesn&rsquo;t have to do that.</p>
<p>Well, why is that?</p>
<p>Well, I am lucky enough to live in a society</p>
<p>where if I had the will, I could elect someone</p>
<p>who could run for office, who could drum up support</p>
<p>and make the case, and then make the law and say,</p>
<p>listen, anybody who wants to be on social media</p>
<p>can be on social media, but they must prove who they are.</p>
<p>So therefore, if I am hearing a debate about vaccines,</p>
<p>I know that it&rsquo;s actually not a working class single mom</p>
<p>from Hammond, Indiana.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s Sergey and Igor in Kaliningrad.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, this goes back to how I grew up.</p>
<p>No, I was going to say, it&rsquo;s analogous to the letters</p>
<p>to the editor and those kinds of things</p>
<p>where there was a person checking</p>
<p>the validity of those kind of apps.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going back to sort of a brick and mortar</p>
<p>model for the cyber age and things</p>
<p>like how we attach accountability</p>
<p>to those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Well, you know where I&rsquo;m going back to?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going back to my mom.</p>
<p>My mom was a health nut.</p>
<p>And I grew up, as you do.</p>
<p>You and I, we grew up in a time when</p>
<p>it was probably the least healthy time to be an American.</p>
<p>You know, because the generations that came before us</p>
<p>had healthy, good food.</p>
<p>It probably didn&rsquo;t last as long.</p>
<p>It was probably a little more expensive,</p>
<p>but it was good for your body.</p>
<p>The generation coming up now is better off</p>
<p>because of what happened to us, where we</p>
<p>were just shoveled in crap.</p>
<p>Now, my mother was one of the first consumer advocates</p>
<p>who lobbied and made sure that everything</p>
<p>that was in the supermarket had ingredients on it.</p>
<p>And so that way, she, at the very least, nothing was banned.</p>
<p>But she, as a consumer, had the choice of what</p>
<p>she put in her child&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>And you can argue that&rsquo;s all we need from social media.</p>
<p>You can say what you want, but I need to know who it is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a first step, is having actual ingredient labels</p>
<p>for information, the same way you have it for nutrition.</p>
<p>Well, what it makes me think about, Max,</p>
<p>is if you and I are talking about national security</p>
<p>concerns, it strikes me that, and you know,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t strike me five minutes ago.</p>
<p>It just struck me now based on what we&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>But it strikes me that one could make a case that true, accurate,</p>
<p>confirmable, trustworthy information</p>
<p>might be more wrapped up in our national security</p>
<p>than we had otherwise thought.</p>
<p>I mean, the old idea of the importance of the fourth estate</p>
<p>to the running of the rest of the constitutional part</p>
<p>of the country, maybe there&rsquo;s something to the idea</p>
<p>that those are all support systems.</p>
<p>And if any one of them becomes rotten</p>
<p>or ceases to function as a support beam,</p>
<p>our stability is perhaps endangered.</p>
<p>What would you say to this idea about maybe something</p>
<p>like truth and factual information</p>
<p>being important enough for our national debates</p>
<p>to be a core component of maybe our national security concerns?</p>
<p>Well, we used to have that.</p>
<p>And I think as a historian, you will appreciate the term</p>
<p>by Francis Fukuyama, the end of history.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And are we allowed to swear on the show or not?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t generally, but, you know, well, say what you want.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll figure out how to handle it.</p>
<p>Well, I think, you know, I will say that the notion,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that in many ways, our institutions</p>
<p>are still stuck in the 90s.</p>
<p>And by that, I mean this notion that it is the end of history,</p>
<p>that all the great challenges are over.</p>
<p>And I think that notion in the 1990s,</p>
<p>that the great challenges of the human race</p>
<p>are over, that it is the end of history,</p>
<p>has, to quote Dr. Samuel Johnson, has fucked us.</p>
<p>And so we need to get back to the idea</p>
<p>that we had, we used to have, that everything is connected,</p>
<p>Dan, that you cannot separate the sheep and the sheepdogs</p>
<p>when it comes to our national security,</p>
<p>that we used to understand that everything eventually</p>
<p>flowed back to keeping us safe.</p>
<p>From our children getting good nutrition,</p>
<p>to our environment keeping us healthy,</p>
<p>to our infrastructure, to our schoolteachers</p>
<p>knowing what they talked about.</p>
<p>Everything, everything meant having</p>
<p>a healthy, well-informed society that</p>
<p>was able to govern itself, and therefore</p>
<p>able to withstand outward threats.</p>
<p>And we gave all that up in the 90s</p>
<p>because we saw the threats as going away.</p>
<p>So we could all just do our own thing.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t need these institutions.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t need oversight.</p>
<p>No more, you know, no more grownups.</p>
<p>Because it was happy time.</p>
<p>Well, the happy time is over.</p>
<p>And we need to get back to the notion</p>
<p>that we can still be free.</p>
<p>We can still make good choices.</p>
<p>But we need to keep our eye on the ball.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m meditating on this we thing that you keep using.</p>
<p>Because it sounds utopian to me at this point.</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t feel like we are a collective, unified.</p>
<p>I see a lot more division, not just in the United States.</p>
<p>But I mean, I think you can see, as you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been able to see for 50 years, echoes</p>
<p>of what goes on in the United States you see elsewhere.</p>
<p>I think you see it in Europe, too.</p>
<p>I think one could make a case that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some of this in Asia also.</p>
<p>These trends of, and you know, it reminds me,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to know about this, Max,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost become sort of an internet trope.</p>
<p>The Project for a New America Century,</p>
<p>New American Century paper that came out before 9-11 saying</p>
<p>that there should be, you know, that the natural tendency</p>
<p>in our country is to pull apart.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s only big events like Pearl Harbor</p>
<p>and whatnot that contradict that momentum.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true or not.</p>
<p>But I would suggest that I think certainly</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where we are now.</p>
<p>And to me, so many of these things</p>
<p>that you say we should do break down</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re not really we, right?</p>
<p>Because if I say, oh, yes, we should do this,</p>
<p>we may be one group of people who want to do A,</p>
<p>and we may be another group of people that want to do B.</p>
<p>And they disagree, and they elect different people</p>
<p>to Congress who fight in the Congress.</p>
<p>And then you have the military industrial complex</p>
<p>and foreign countries buying access on K Street.</p>
<p>I mean, the way this actually all interacts</p>
<p>when it gets into the soup of actual reality</p>
<p>sounds a little bit more complicated to me</p>
<p>than this idea that we need to do this,</p>
<p>and we need to do that.</p>
<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t say that we need to do what&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>And this is always what I come up against,</p>
<p>whether I&rsquo;m talking to a strategic studies</p>
<p>group or a biodefense panel.</p>
<p>The pushback I always get really can be boiled down</p>
<p>to what you&rsquo;re saying we need to do is hard, to which I say,</p>
<p>yes, yes, it is.</p>
<p>Running a self-governing democratic system</p>
<p>is very difficult, which is why you</p>
<p>see the appeal of dictatorship, because I</p>
<p>think there is something in all of us,</p>
<p>really, deep down, that wants to be children.</p>
<p>Remember that horrible moment when we were kids,</p>
<p>and bit by bit we had our innocence ripped away from us,</p>
<p>and we realized, oh, my god, I have to do work.</p>
<p>I have to help take care of myself.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s painfully</p>
<p>traumatic for all human beings.</p>
<p>We start off completely helpless.</p>
<p>Someone else is running everything.</p>
<p>Some of us are very lucky to have</p>
<p>the people who are running everything</p>
<p>know what they&rsquo;re doing, or we think</p>
<p>they know what they&rsquo;re doing, and we get to go out and play.</p>
<p>And then bit by bit, we go, oh, boy, I got to pitch in.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s hard, and it sucks.</p>
<p>Well, we live in a society where we have chosen to be grownups.</p>
<p>And being grownups is hard, and it&rsquo;s messy, and it&rsquo;s painful,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Or you can choose to live in a country like Russia, or China,</p>
<p>or Iran, in which you can be a child,</p>
<p>and you are not responsible for how things go.</p>
<p>Somebody else is in charge, and you</p>
<p>get to blame them.</p>
<p>And so we have a lot of freedoms in this country,</p>
<p>but what we don&rsquo;t have is freedom from responsibility.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;m very blessed in that I had two greatest</p>
<p>generation parents who told me about what it was like to grow</p>
<p>up like that, where you had to do your part,</p>
<p>and serve, and sacrifice, and it sucked.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what you got to do if you want to live this way.</p>
<p>See, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>You bring back so many echoes of the way we were all raised.</p>
<p>I mean, these are the sort of things that, in our generation,</p>
<p>we were infused with.</p>
<p>And this is Cold War stuff to me.</p>
<p>I mean, this is why we fight, like the old line about why</p>
<p>we fight.</p>
<p>These are the things that they would put in a movie</p>
<p>that you would see between the double feature in the movie</p>
<p>theater explaining what this war in Europe is all about,</p>
<p>and American values, and Western democracy,</p>
<p>and all this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But I mean, we&rsquo;ve had a civil war in this country before.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not so much about people not wanting</p>
<p>to do the hard work and wanting someone.</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>In other words, some of what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>sounds to me like on a different level from, hey,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had a civil war before.</p>
<p>We could have a civil war again.</p>
<p>And if we have a civil war, well,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not helping any of this democratic stuff</p>
<p>we were just talking about.</p>
<p>And I mean, I would put the odds,</p>
<p>and this is a stupid thing to do.</p>
<p>But I mean, I would put the odds of the United States</p>
<p>having a civil war in the next 25 years</p>
<p>as better than they&rsquo;ve ever been since the 1850s.</p>
<p>And that says something.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not sure what it says.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re in the halls of power</p>
<p>and your job is to defend the United States from threats</p>
<p>both foreign and domestic, I&rsquo;m more scared of that</p>
<p>because I think that&rsquo;s more of a realistic threat</p>
<p>than coming to blows, for example, with Russia,</p>
<p>even though coming to blows with Russia</p>
<p>ain&rsquo;t as far away as it used to be either.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>And as far as, I mean, a civil war, everyone is always,</p>
<p>that seems to be what everybody&rsquo;s talking about.</p>
<p>I mean, as we both know, it&rsquo;s not going to be 1860s.</p>
<p>No, no, because we&rsquo;re all mixed together.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no easy divide.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have it precinct by precinct.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there is a real fear.</p>
<p>There is a real, honest to God, fear.</p>
<p>And I know this from my friends in the national security</p>
<p>world of a right wing, white supremacist insurgency</p>
<p>in this country.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very real, and it&rsquo;s bubbling.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not inevitable.</p>
<p>None of this is inevitable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the wonderful thing about a free and democratic society</p>
<p>is self-correction.</p>
<p>But we get back to the truth.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a loop here because it gets back</p>
<p>to the truth thing, right?</p>
<p>Because these people, one would make the case,</p>
<p>and I have, that the great ballast</p>
<p>of the American electorate would self-correct</p>
<p>if given reliable information that they could trust.</p>
<p>Now, I would make the case that I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a society in the world that has ever</p>
<p>been given reliable information that they could trust.</p>
<p>But I would say that the democracies maybe</p>
<p>in the 1970s and 1980s gave it a good stab.</p>
<p>But without that, and with the disinformation,</p>
<p>and with all of the choose your own truth</p>
<p>sort of post-20th century society we live in now,</p>
<p>I feel like the self-correction mechanisms are broken.</p>
<p>So if you don&rsquo;t have that truth and reliability factor,</p>
<p>does it impede our ability to self-correct?</p>
<p>And if we can&rsquo;t self-correct, what does that mean?</p>
<p>Well, I feel that it is all, it might be broken,</p>
<p>but it is all fixable if we do our part.</p>
<p>And that is something that we used to understand.</p>
<p>And like I said, this goes back to what I was saying before,</p>
<p>is that that means having to see yourself</p>
<p>as part of something bigger, and having</p>
<p>to do things you necessarily don&rsquo;t want to do.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m buoyed by the fact that I live in LA, which</p>
<p>is the most selfish, narcissistic, lazy Sodom</p>
<p>and Gomorrah ever, ever.</p>
<p>I mean, if you want to point to possibly the worst of America,</p>
<p>welcome to my hometown.</p>
<p>And yet, for the first time in my life,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing my neighbors starting to take</p>
<p>an interest in local politics, and the details</p>
<p>of local politics.</p>
<p>Why is this happening?</p>
<p>Nobody I&rsquo;ve ever known, my whole life,</p>
<p>knew who our city councilman was.</p>
<p>Nobody cared.</p>
<p>We lived our lives.</p>
<p>And now, because the homeless crisis is out of control,</p>
<p>and people are asking, why is this happening?</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t believe the propaganda they&rsquo;re hearing,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re starting to have community meetings.</p>
<p>And for the first time in my life,</p>
<p>I went to a meeting in the cold, sitting out, freezing my buns</p>
<p>off, for a candidate who&rsquo;s going to run for city council.</p>
<p>A municipal attorney talking to me about court cases,</p>
<p>and why things are the way they are,</p>
<p>and the big money that&rsquo;s at work.</p>
<p>And if she is elected, what she will do to unseat the man who</p>
<p>has allowed homelessness to run rampant.</p>
<p>And by the way, not helping the homeless people either.</p>
<p>She rattled off statistics of every homeless person</p>
<p>who died in and out of shelters in LA that night.</p>
<p>Now, she is just one person.</p>
<p>But if I do my part, and show up, and sit in the cold,</p>
<p>and maybe give a little money, and maybe canvas for her,</p>
<p>and maybe do some phone calls, I can help</p>
<p>make a little bit of difference.</p>
<p>And maybe if my neighbors do that,</p>
<p>they can make a little bit of difference.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get to do that in China, or North Korea, or Russia.</p>
<p>I get to do that here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to, I feel like we&rsquo;re circling around the same points</p>
<p>again, which is I&rsquo;m thinking about the end.</p>
<p>You know, remember, there&rsquo;s a Star Trek episode.</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m contractually obligated to bring that up.</p>
<p>But where there&rsquo;s a mere universe, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the absolute opposite of everything.</p>
<p>And in my mind, there is a Max Brooks in Los Angeles,</p>
<p>or maybe he&rsquo;s in Georgia.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the opposite of Los Angeles is.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s got a goatee.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s going and doing just what Max Brooks is doing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to support this candidate who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to unseat them.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s on the exact opposite of all the issues.</p>
<p>In other words, I feel like your activism is canceled out</p>
<p>by the other Max Brooks.</p>
<p>And that describes the country as a whole.</p>
<p>You know, you keep saying we, and we.</p>
<p>But we is something that, to get back</p>
<p>to that Project for a New America Century thesis,</p>
<p>was that we&rsquo;re naturally pulling apart.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like that we is here.</p>
<p>And if you say, OK, if it&rsquo;s not here now,</p>
<p>what can foster the conditions to recreate that sense of unity</p>
<p>so that we comes back?</p>
<p>Well, then are we talking about a specific kind of leadership?</p>
<p>I mean, do you need an almost JFK call</p>
<p>to some sort of higher calling?</p>
<p>I mean, if you decide, if Dan and Max have identified</p>
<p>the problem right here as a sort of a we, unity, lack of focus,</p>
<p>lack of whatever that might be, a need</p>
<p>for a reinvigoration of our democratic system,</p>
<p>how does one accomplish that beyond the child level?</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re all children and would rather just be led,</p>
<p>how does one do this?</p>
<p>Well, I think we all need to be more aware of the forces at work</p>
<p>that are pulling us apart.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t just say it&rsquo;s just happening.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t just say, oh, we&rsquo;re just being pulled apart.</p>
<p>No, there are actual forces at work that are pulling us apart.</p>
<p>And if we identify those forces, then we</p>
<p>can actually combat it as opposed</p>
<p>to some sort of nebulous darkness</p>
<p>that we all see as inevitable.</p>
<p>OK, I like this, though.</p>
<p>I like this, though, because I think</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to interrupt you, but I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve hit the nail on the head here.</p>
<p>So what happens when our freedom, right,</p>
<p>the fact that we get to debate, we get to have the,</p>
<p>what happens when our very freedom is</p>
<p>part of what undermines what you&rsquo;re just talking about?</p>
<p>In other words, we can have multiple media companies all</p>
<p>giving a very different narrative,</p>
<p>playing that narrative to a very different audience,</p>
<p>interested not in truth, but in clicks, viewers, audience</p>
<p>size, impact, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a facet of our freedom, right?</p>
<p>Putin doesn&rsquo;t have to deal with an opposition network</p>
<p>that he, you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s our very freedom</p>
<p>that has opened the door to these things that</p>
<p>are the impediments to us becoming we again.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>So we need to identify what exactly are the forces at work.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what makes me so optimistic,</p>
<p>because finally, after years and years of banging my head</p>
<p>against a wall, I am starting to see the national debates start</p>
<p>to center around these forces.</p>
<p>For the first time in decades, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>starting to hear people on TV, on social media</p>
<p>talk about voter suppression.</p>
<p>Well, what exactly does it mean, redistricting, gerrymandering?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also starting to hear the attack on social media</p>
<p>about these algorithms that specifically</p>
<p>are devoted to extremism.</p>
<p>You know, this has been happening for decades,</p>
<p>but we were much more concerned with what</p>
<p>Lindsay Lohan was up to.</p>
<p>And it is so wonderful to hear the top stories now</p>
<p>about these forces at work, because we</p>
<p>have to identify them first in order</p>
<p>to do something about them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like in my neighborhood, going back to local politics.</p>
<p>For years, I was just seeing the homelessness getting out</p>
<p>of control and homeless people dying on the streets</p>
<p>and their encampments bursting into flames,</p>
<p>but always hearing, oh, it&rsquo;s inevitable, or oh, God,</p>
<p>this is so terrible, we need to do something.</p>
<p>Or they&rsquo;re the victims, and they have rights.</p>
<p>And if you want to do something to mess with their rights,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a fascist.</p>
<p>Well, for the first time, I heard a candidate say, no, no,</p>
<p>no, you have to look at it in terms of addiction,</p>
<p>mental illness, the housing plans, long-term housing.</p>
<p>I mean, really breaking it down.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m starting to see on a national level.</p>
<p>Why do my neighbors fly opposite flags?</p>
<p>Why do they watch opposite TV shows?</p>
<p>If we can identify them, we can also solve them.</p>
<p>You know, when I look at the current climate,</p>
<p>and this is all simplistic stuff,</p>
<p>and this is why I&rsquo;m not a historian,</p>
<p>because I can play with all these simplistic,</p>
<p>non-representative scenarios and not worry about it.</p>
<p>But I mean, to me, there&rsquo;s a Weimar Germany vibe.</p>
<p>And the Weimar Germany vibe is that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>extremists on both sides.</p>
<p>And both of those groups are growing in size,</p>
<p>pulling people from the ballast, the societal ballast</p>
<p>in the center, because there is no center to hold.</p>
<p>So in the Weimar situation, it was</p>
<p>a level of distrust and disenchantment</p>
<p>with the ability of that government</p>
<p>to do what the people there wanted done.</p>
<p>And that helps peel the ballast population off</p>
<p>to the extremes.</p>
<p>So I guess what I&rsquo;m saying is in the 21st century,</p>
<p>so there was something I remember in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>It was when Al Gore and Bill Clinton</p>
<p>were running for office against George Bush Sr.</p>
<p>And one of the planks that they were pushing</p>
<p>was this idea of reinventing government.</p>
<p>And what I liked about the idea of reinventing government,</p>
<p>forget the specifics, was this idea</p>
<p>that because of new technology and new things being learned</p>
<p>all the time, we should not assume</p>
<p>that that is not something that can be continually done.</p>
<p>Because during that time period, there</p>
<p>was this attitude that government is government.</p>
<p>It was the same in ancient Greece.</p>
<p>It is the same now.</p>
<p>The pluses and minuses are all the same.</p>
<p>What I liked about the Gore-Clinton idea</p>
<p>at the time was this concept that, no, we</p>
<p>can improve these things.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to sit and stand pat</p>
<p>and pretend like none of this stuff can be improved.</p>
<p>If this is the Weimar Germany situation,</p>
<p>then improving the credibility and the functioning</p>
<p>and the belief and trust in the government</p>
<p>itself would be a way, I would think,</p>
<p>to reverse the peeling off of the ballast population</p>
<p>to the extremes.</p>
<p>How can something like that be done?</p>
<p>Because to me, again, everything,</p>
<p>and you said it yourself, everything</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about here, which seems</p>
<p>like a bunch of different issues not connected</p>
<p>to military things at all, are all wrapped up</p>
<p>in our national security more than most people might think,</p>
<p>including this, is the government functioning?</p>
<p>Is it not functioning?</p>
<p>Can it be fixed?</p>
<p>Can it be improved?</p>
<p>And if it can&rsquo;t, what does that mean?</p>
<p>Yes, well, this is what I mean about reintroducing ourselves</p>
<p>to the connections, where we used to,</p>
<p>my parents&rsquo; generation used to understand</p>
<p>how everything was connected.</p>
<p>But like I said, the 90s fucked us,</p>
<p>because the 90s believed that it was the end of history,</p>
<p>and we could all take our eye off the ball</p>
<p>and do our own thing, and we understand that we can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We understand a lot, a big portion</p>
<p>of our friends and neighbors became</p>
<p>radicalized in the 90s because of globalization.</p>
<p>The jobs moved away.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s economics.</p>
<p>But that economics flowed into politics.</p>
<p>At the same time, we deregulated the media.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s politics and economics.</p>
<p>Those two were connected.</p>
<p>At the same time, you then had the rise</p>
<p>of the opioid addiction, which goes into public health.</p>
<p>At the very same time, you are outsourcing things</p>
<p>like the biotech industry, which meant that when COVID hit,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have enough supplies, because it was all overseas.</p>
<p>We used to understand how everything flowed together.</p>
<p>And in the 90s, we completely outsourced everything.</p>
<p>And we need to understand that everything is connected.</p>
<p>And once again, going back to being,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m buoyed by the fact that we are</p>
<p>starting to understand this now.</p>
<p>Our policy on China is starting to change,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s bipartisan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so buoyed by the fact that Trump was China hawk,</p>
<p>but so is Biden.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t just come in and say, well,</p>
<p>everything Trump said is wrong.</p>
<p>He said, no, we have been financing</p>
<p>a whole alternative method of government,</p>
<p>which is based on capitalism without democracy,</p>
<p>and that is wrong.</p>
<p>And I think that if we support that notion,</p>
<p>we can get back to the idea that our value shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be taken for granted.</p>
<p>Nation states do exist.</p>
<p>There are different ways of living our lives.</p>
<p>And we can wrest back control, which will bring us together.</p>
<p>So that takes us back.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve added now the dimension of something like this.</p>
<p>So the China hawk question is interesting to me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what we gain from all this, whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the United States.</p>
<p>So if we assume, and this is a little off the path of what</p>
<p>we were talking about, but since this national security</p>
<p>umbrella pretty much covers anything we want to shove</p>
<p>into this space, it seems to me that the country&rsquo;s policy</p>
<p>should be dictated towards what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>best for the people who pay the bills that the country racks</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>How does confrontation with other large nation states</p>
<p>benefit the average American on the ground?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s different types of confrontation.</p>
<p>If you have our carrier battle group facing off</p>
<p>with the Chinese carrier battle group in the South China Sea</p>
<p>and everybody&rsquo;s got their finger on the button,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably not going to turn out well.</p>
<p>However, it is time to reach back into history,</p>
<p>specifically the 1990s and the early 2000s,</p>
<p>and reset our trade relationship with China.</p>
<p>Because we believed in the goodness of our hearts,</p>
<p>going on the death of the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>that if we were to just engage with China,</p>
<p>bring them into the World Trade Organization,</p>
<p>and put factories, Nike and Apple over there,</p>
<p>and they would liberalize.</p>
<p>We believed that liberalization would come</p>
<p>from economic engagement.</p>
<p>OK, nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>I personally think that&rsquo;s a better foot to start out with.</p>
<p>But now we know that it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>Now we know that instead of them becoming more like us,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re using our money to make us more like them.</p>
<p>They are now using our greed to influence us here at home,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the NBA not being able to say anything</p>
<p>about Hong Kong, or whether they&rsquo;re censoring</p>
<p>Hollywood movies now.</p>
<p>We understand now that it has backfired.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>Yay for a society that&rsquo;s able to self-correct.</p>
<p>We can reset those trade agreements and say,</p>
<p>I am very, very sorry, corporate America.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m very, very sorry, Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>We can no longer finance a system that</p>
<p>is dedicated to ending ours.</p>
<p>If you want to do business with us,</p>
<p>then you have to compromise.</p>
<p>And you have to be a fair player in the game.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t, then you can be like South Africa</p>
<p>and go your own way.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>So this is interesting, because I would argue that,</p>
<p>and I think you set it up well by saying that they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>gotten us addicted.</p>
<p>And we have to, we&rsquo;ve fused our societies together</p>
<p>in ways that have made it difficult for either one of us</p>
<p>to pull apart without hurting ourselves.</p>
<p>But what I would argue is that we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the control over, so let me back up.</p>
<p>I have these wonderful history books,</p>
<p>and they will show ads from American companies</p>
<p>during the Second World War.</p>
<p>So there was one for an American cigarette manufacturer,</p>
<p>Lucky Strikes.</p>
<p>And the ad was how Lucky Strike had changed its color to green</p>
<p>for the war effort, the poster said, right?</p>
<p>In other words, to support the United States in the war</p>
<p>against the Axis.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an American company back in the day</p>
<p>when companies had a more tie to their nation states of origin.</p>
<p>Now these are global international concerns</p>
<p>with as much stuff on the ground in China as they have here.</p>
<p>If you were to get into a Third World War with China,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure all these companies</p>
<p>are going to pick us like Lucky Strikes did,</p>
<p>rather than stand aside and just say, hey,</p>
<p>we just do business with people.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to get involved in this dispute.</p>
<p>I guess what I&rsquo;m saying is you can still have these,</p>
<p>you can have bilateral trade agreements with China.</p>
<p>You can have these giant NAFTA or GATT-type deals</p>
<p>that China has to then adhere to the rules</p>
<p>the rest of the world&rsquo;s playing by.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;re going to necessarily</p>
<p>get the very companies on board here by telling them</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to have to penalize themselves,</p>
<p>their stockholders, their bottom line,</p>
<p>by somehow punishing the largest, one of the largest,</p>
<p>because it depends on whether you&rsquo;re going numbers of people</p>
<p>or the amount of spending money available per person,</p>
<p>but one of the largest markets available on the planet.</p>
<p>Well, this is what I mean.</p>
<p>This goes right back to how we started the conversation.</p>
<p>This goes back to asymmetric means of fighting.</p>
<p>When I look at the global competition</p>
<p>between American Western democratic freedoms</p>
<p>and Chinese authoritarianism, I think,</p>
<p>which is the best way to spend our money?</p>
<p>We have a limited amount.</p>
<p>Do we spend it on trying to match their hypersonic missiles</p>
<p>with our hypersonic missiles?</p>
<p>Or do we take that money and use it as tax incentives</p>
<p>for our companies to move back to Ohio and the Rust Belt</p>
<p>rather than making money overseas,</p>
<p>than putting all that money into sweatshops overseas?</p>
<p>Which one gives us more leverage over the PRC?</p>
<p>Well, again, I think then you&rsquo;re getting into long-term&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re going to say that&hellip;</p>
<p>You know, what&rsquo;s great about this, Max,</p>
<p>is we could do six hours on this</p>
<p>because everything we talk about</p>
<p>leads to the next step in the conversation.</p>
<p>And they all are completely interactive with each other, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re pinging off all the other societal questions</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re dealing with.</p>
<p>For example, if you talk about things like the Rust Belt</p>
<p>and tax incentives to pay people there enough</p>
<p>to do what the Chinese sweatshops are doing,</p>
<p>well, then you&rsquo;re talking about maybe 20 or 30.</p>
<p>I mean, when does that stop, right?</p>
<p>Then in the next generation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have people saying,</p>
<p>oh, my gosh, now you just had these lazy people</p>
<p>in the Rust Belt who don&rsquo;t have to work</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re getting these&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, I think you&rsquo;re going to&hellip;</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a yin and yang.</p>
<p>You talked about self-correction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll be&hellip;</p>
<p>I can hear the Milton Friedmanites out there saying,</p>
<p>no, no, no, no, no, that&rsquo;s not how you run economics.</p>
<p>But to get back to what you were saying</p>
<p>about national security and asymmetrical warfare,</p>
<p>this is going to be a problem</p>
<p>whether or not we&rsquo;re dealing with China per se</p>
<p>or Russia per se.</p>
<p>And this is the problem I&rsquo;ve always had</p>
<p>with U.S. foreign policy is we sort of say,</p>
<p>okay, this is the great adversary.</p>
<p>And you had talked about the Francis Fukuyama</p>
<p>end of history moment.</p>
<p>Well, that only happened because we&rsquo;d had a 50-year</p>
<p>Cold War that seemed over.</p>
<p>And then you think, okay, ding dong, the witch is dead.</p>
<p>Now we can just have a nice, peaceful world.</p>
<p>And we forgot that there were global interactions</p>
<p>between nations that existed</p>
<p>before there was a Soviet Union</p>
<p>that would come back into play.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re going to come back into play</p>
<p>whether there&rsquo;s a China down the road</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re worried about or&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, they could become our best friends tomorrow</p>
<p>and there will be some other thing behind them</p>
<p>that necessitates our need to keep building tanks</p>
<p>in the key districts in Georgia,</p>
<p>whether we need them or not.</p>
<p>You see what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Yes, and this is why I think it is critical for America</p>
<p>to learn from its own history.</p>
<p>Because we started this conversation</p>
<p>talking about how we don&rsquo;t learn from our defeats.</p>
<p>We also don&rsquo;t learn from our victories.</p>
<p>One of the conversations that I&rsquo;ve been listening to</p>
<p>within the halls of national security</p>
<p>is the re-engagement with what&rsquo;s called soft power.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally.</p>
<p>And we used to be masters at that.</p>
<p>And I guarantee you have this picture in your library</p>
<p>of an American Marine on Okinawa</p>
<p>giving a canteen to an old Okinawan woman on a stretcher.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We all know that picture.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s who we used to be.</p>
<p>We used to have two armies at the same time.</p>
<p>The army would go in and beat the enemy with guns and bombs.</p>
<p>The second army would come in with quinine and sea rations.</p>
<p>And I was part of living history in 1994 when I went to Russia.</p>
<p>And I watched them all standing there with their hands out</p>
<p>waiting for another Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>And why shouldn&rsquo;t there have been?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what America does.</p>
<p>When we conquer an enemy, we rebuild them</p>
<p>and make them see the advantage of our way</p>
<p>instead of leaving them to rot.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Once again, the 90s.</p>
<p>OK, Russia, you&rsquo;re free.</p>
<p>We have better things to do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s naked people on our computers.</p>
<p>And that kind of on we and rot gave way to poop.</p>
<p>Well, and then also expanding NATO to the Russian borders</p>
<p>might not have been the best balance of power move either.</p>
<p>And once again, so as you&rsquo;re leaving the Russians to decay</p>
<p>and fall, and I literally spoke to when I was a college kid</p>
<p>talking to a member of the State Department in Moscow,</p>
<p>telling me that these people, these very proud people,</p>
<p>are watching their country go from being</p>
<p>an industrial powerhouse to an exporter of raw materials.</p>
<p>To which then I spoke to a Dutch businessman who said,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t kid yourself.</p>
<p>Their biggest export is women.</p>
<p>Now, how is that going to play on the soul of a nation</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s not going to come back to haunt us?</p>
<p>And it did.</p>
<p>And here we are.</p>
<p>So we need to also remember our history.</p>
<p>Like you said, there&rsquo;s going to be other threats.</p>
<p>Well, we also have to look back and say, well,</p>
<p>what did we do wrong?</p>
<p>But also, what did we do right?</p>
<p>Because America&rsquo;s done a lot of things really, really right.</p>
<p>And we need to remember that whenever we</p>
<p>engage with other countries.</p>
<p>This has not happened for the first time.</p>
<p>It has happened before.</p>
<p>So you mentioned the soft power.</p>
<p>So this is a problem that I&rsquo;ve had talking to people.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re generally not the military people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re people that enjoy the ability to use force</p>
<p>and who seem to think that things like diplomacy</p>
<p>is a sign of weakness for countries that</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have large militaries.</p>
<p>And I keep trying to point out historical examples</p>
<p>of diplomacy, which is used not as a shield,</p>
<p>although there&rsquo;s nothing to be scoffed at when it is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very valuable.</p>
<p>But as a sword.</p>
<p>I mean, you look at how the Chinese and the Byzantines</p>
<p>used diplomacy, for example.</p>
<p>I mean, they would destroy whole nations without using</p>
<p>their military at all.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve really forgotten, is that this stuff.</p>
<p>And this is something, by the way,</p>
<p>that our adversaries have not forgotten at all.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t scoff.</p>
<p>I mean, that is what this undermining us,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s happening through our own social media,</p>
<p>is very similar to, right?</p>
<p>This idea that there are ways to defeat your enemy</p>
<p>without putting on the armor, saying</p>
<p>your lineage to your adversary across the giant mode,</p>
<p>and then getting into Victor Davis Hansen style</p>
<p>Western hoplite combat.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re just as dead if somebody</p>
<p>shoots you from behind.</p>
<p>And I feel like some of these things</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about here, our own people</p>
<p>would think was sort of wimpy.</p>
<p>But listen, if the Byzantines can destroy you</p>
<p>without using their military, why use it?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s soft power used like a weapon.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, well, I think this comes from the fact</p>
<p>that America has changed from my dad&rsquo;s generation.</p>
<p>When my dad was in World War II, everybody served.</p>
<p>And everyone understood soft power</p>
<p>because everybody who had fought in World War II</p>
<p>was also part of the armies of occupation.</p>
<p>My dad&rsquo;s last job in the Second World War in occupied Germany</p>
<p>was counterinsurgency.</p>
<p>Because as we both know, the werewolves,</p>
<p>the idea that these Nazi kids, these Hitler youth,</p>
<p>they were going to go into the mountains.</p>
<p>They were going to go into the forest.</p>
<p>There were caches of weapons buried.</p>
<p>And they were going to fight the Allies for the next 100 years.</p>
<p>Well, the reason my dad survived to make me</p>
<p>is because those insurgencies died out</p>
<p>because those kids had jobs.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have to fight.</p>
<p>Because the moment they came out of the forest,</p>
<p>somebody said, hey, you, kid, we got some milk</p>
<p>that needs delivering.</p>
<p>You want a job?</p>
<p>And they did that.</p>
<p>And the rebuilding of Germany and Japan</p>
<p>is what made them not just passive,</p>
<p>but some of our best allies.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s changed because now we have a sheep and sheepdog</p>
<p>military.</p>
<p>And most of the people in the military I talk to</p>
<p>understand that.</p>
<p>They understand what soft power really means.</p>
<p>I met a special forces officer who&rsquo;d</p>
<p>been to the Ebola task force in West Africa.</p>
<p>And he said, we have an open door now.</p>
<p>Thanks to what we did in West Africa with Ebola,</p>
<p>they will welcome us there for any reason.</p>
<p>If we need to get into West Africa</p>
<p>in any of those countries, we will be welcomed with open arms.</p>
<p>The people you&rsquo;re talking about, the hawks,</p>
<p>tend to be chicken hawks who&rsquo;ve never actually served,</p>
<p>who are very macho and don&rsquo;t know actually what the facts</p>
<p>are overseas on the ground.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s another problem of the sheep and the sheepdogs.</p>
<p>Because when you tend to see these people pushing</p>
<p>for armed conflict, they tend not</p>
<p>to be the people who&rsquo;ve actually been</p>
<p>in the profession of arms.</p>
<p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>I also want to point out that, you know,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve referenced it multiple times,</p>
<p>this idea about like in your dad&rsquo;s era.</p>
<p>And my grandfather was in the AEF Army of Occupation</p>
<p>in the First World War.</p>
<p>But we should recall that those people that</p>
<p>may have been unity, but it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>unity of a sort that had existed forever.</p>
<p>This was conscription, right?</p>
<p>This was a temporary unity because of the war effort.</p>
<p>I mean, the idea that this was how it was in 1900</p>
<p>or something is a real departure from US history.</p>
<p>And that to me is what the second, you know,</p>
<p>you had talked about how the Gulf War kind of screwed us.</p>
<p>My own view is that the Second World War screwed us</p>
<p>is because it put us on this path that we&rsquo;re still on now</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s no getting off.</p>
<p>Where, like you mentioned, if we needed</p>
<p>to get into West Africa, well, the American in me</p>
<p>says, why on earth would we need to get into West Africa?</p>
<p>Right, what does West Africa have to do with us?</p>
<p>But in the 21st century American mindset,</p>
<p>any place in the world is potential interest zone.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we have to have bases all over the planet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we have, what is it?</p>
<p>We have, I think we have a military command</p>
<p>for every continent except one and now space.</p>
<p>I think most countries would say, I mean, if you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s pick out, I&rsquo;m trying to think of it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re Denmark, that&rsquo;s not a concern for you.</p>
<p>But it is a concern for us and has been</p>
<p>since the Second World War.</p>
<p>Max, what would happen if we found out</p>
<p>to dovetail this whole conversation</p>
<p>into one sort of bucket?</p>
<p>What if the biggest threat to our national security</p>
<p>as a nation is the path that we have set ourselves on,</p>
<p>which would put us in confrontation</p>
<p>with any other great power on the planet</p>
<p>that seeks to be a great power on the planet</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t like them?</p>
<p>I think that the Second World War set us on the best path</p>
<p>because it made us understand that we are all trapped</p>
<p>on this very tiny little planet.</p>
<p>And what affects one of us affects all of us.</p>
<p>And we understood that because after the Second World War,</p>
<p>we did not establish an American empire.</p>
<p>You talk about military commands.</p>
<p>However, these military commands are all partnerships.</p>
<p>These are not armies of occupation.</p>
<p>These are armies of alliances that we have.</p>
<p>We spent the immediate post-war period</p>
<p>setting up international organizations</p>
<p>like the United Nations and the World Health Organization, NATO,</p>
<p>the European Union, all these different organizations</p>
<p>that are very, very messy and go against the polar opposite</p>
<p>of some of us who are isolationist.</p>
<p>But there was a forward-thinking, enlightened</p>
<p>part of that generation who led America</p>
<p>through the Second World War that</p>
<p>understood the only way to avoid a third world war</p>
<p>is if we all work together.</p>
<p>Because like you said, it doesn&rsquo;t affect Denmark.</p>
<p>Yes, it does.</p>
<p>What affects a tiny little country across the world</p>
<p>will eventually, if left unchecked, come to Denmark.</p>
<p>Now that, before anybody jumps in there,</p>
<p>starts making comments, that does not</p>
<p>mean the Bush doctrine, which means</p>
<p>that we must intervene militarily</p>
<p>at the first sight of trouble and go it alone</p>
<p>and get all the Americans killed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I mean at all.</p>
<p>What I mean is we must identify how these problems,</p>
<p>no matter how far away they are, will eventually</p>
<p>come to all of our shores.</p>
<p>How do we identify them?</p>
<p>How do we all work together and share</p>
<p>the burden of responsibility?</p>
<p>And we used to be really, really good at that.</p>
<p>And as you and I both know as history buffs,</p>
<p>the very first test of that was the Korean War.</p>
<p>And it was not an American war, as faux historians</p>
<p>would want us to believe.</p>
<p>That was a UN conflict.</p>
<p>Yeah, fought under the UN flag, yeah.</p>
<p>Fought under the UN flag, because that</p>
<p>was a threat to all of us.</p>
<p>Same thing right now.</p>
<p>We talk about vaccine diplomacy.</p>
<p>I think COVID should be a wake-up call,</p>
<p>because it is a threat to all of us.</p>
<p>So even though it did start in China, it did come to Denmark.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about, see, it&rsquo;s funny, because, and this is,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a natural contrary, and I think,</p>
<p>and a natural devil&rsquo;s advocate.</p>
<p>So I hope you&rsquo;ll take this all in the spirit that it&rsquo;s meant.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m thinking about, like, the very things</p>
<p>that you were talking about in terms</p>
<p>of enhancing global stability, enhancing global peace.</p>
<p>And I see it in just the opposite sense.</p>
<p>So take the alliance system before the First World War,</p>
<p>which was seen as a stability-producing sort</p>
<p>of thing, and then, of course, after the First World War,</p>
<p>it was blamed as one of the main potential stressors that</p>
<p>might have led to not allowing the countries involved</p>
<p>in the war much leeway once things got rolling.</p>
<p>For example, if we ended up, I mean,</p>
<p>we mentioned earlier the NATO pushing</p>
<p>the borders towards Russia.</p>
<p>Now, I have no problem with all the people in Europe</p>
<p>who want to get involved in an alliance</p>
<p>to protect themselves to do that.</p>
<p>But I do think that alliance systems have</p>
<p>a way of prompting counter-alliance systems,</p>
<p>and then history shows spheres of interest and influence</p>
<p>get breached, and you end up with problems.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what Belgium becomes in the First World War</p>
<p>kind of, and what one might make the case</p>
<p>that the Baltic nations, or who knows,</p>
<p>Donbass in Ukraine, or Georgia when they were talking</p>
<p>about the NATO stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel like these all become,</p>
<p>if you want to look at them in a negative light as opposed</p>
<p>to the positive, we&rsquo;re creating more global stability,</p>
<p>these are also potential flashpoints,</p>
<p>areas of disagreement, area, I mean,</p>
<p>look at what we would be facing today, Max,</p>
<p>potentially, if we hadn&rsquo;t sort of backed off,</p>
<p>and this sounds terrible because it</p>
<p>sounds like you&rsquo;re leaving people in the lurch,</p>
<p>but if we were still basically pledging</p>
<p>to defend Taiwan from China, we right now</p>
<p>would be looking at, I mean, Taiwan</p>
<p>could be Belgium in the First World War.</p>
<p>So I mean, in my mind, these things</p>
<p>are all potentially double-edged swords.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not arguing that we don&rsquo;t get stability</p>
<p>in some of these cases, but let&rsquo;s not ignore the fact</p>
<p>that they also become potential flashpoints</p>
<p>that trap decision makers and policy makers.</p>
<p>Well, I would argue, though, that the only way</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trapped is if you&rsquo;re overly rigid either way.</p>
<p>Because even at our-</p>
<p>Wait, but in a negotiation, you&rsquo;re only one side.</p>
<p>The other side has to tango also, right?</p>
<p>Yes, but at some point, you always</p>
<p>are deciding where you&rsquo;re going to draw the line.</p>
<p>You know, at our height, the Korean War</p>
<p>could have gone into World War III,</p>
<p>but that was a decision to keep it limited.</p>
<p>Likewise, in 56, when the Hungarians rose up,</p>
<p>Eisenhower made a very specific decision</p>
<p>that defending the Hungarian people,</p>
<p>and I remember I was at the Atlantic Council,</p>
<p>this other think tank that I&rsquo;m on,</p>
<p>speaking to a Hungarian diplomat.</p>
<p>It was 1956, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>In 56, and I said, listen, we screwed you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, we did.</p>
<p>But Eisenhower made a calculated decision</p>
<p>that the temporary freedom of the Hungarian people</p>
<p>was not worth the nuclear annihilation</p>
<p>of the entire world, and he was right.</p>
<p>And as a result, you and I are right here.</p>
<p>So alliances work, but alliances are not biblical text</p>
<p>that must be followed fundamentally.</p>
<p>They are fluid, and we must decide when and where.</p>
<p>The same way Nixon decided to flip China.</p>
<p>If we were ideologues, then the entire communist world</p>
<p>would have always been against us.</p>
<p>Likewise, Tito was our communist,</p>
<p>and Fidel Castro could have been our communist</p>
<p>if we hadn&rsquo;t been so stupid.</p>
<p>Likewise, Ho Chi Minh could have been our communist,</p>
<p>because he wanted to be.</p>
<p>He wanted to be our ally.</p>
<p>No, he liked George Washington, I know.</p>
<p>Yes, so what I&rsquo;m saying is alliances work.</p>
<p>So Max, would you offer NATO a membership to Ukraine?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>If alliances work?</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>I would say that we need to understand</p>
<p>where the alliances end.</p>
<p>We have to understand Russian culture.</p>
<p>We have to understand Russian history.</p>
<p>We have to say to Putin, listen, you</p>
<p>want to protect your borders.</p>
<p>We understand that.</p>
<p>Ukraine cannot join NATO.</p>
<p>However, if you continue to fund this war,</p>
<p>then we will have that episode of Star Trek,</p>
<p>where the hill people and the village people</p>
<p>are both getting flintlocks.</p>
<p>Because for Dan, a private little war.</p>
<p>This is exactly what I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>when it comes to asymmetry.</p>
<p>Does it mean that if Putin rolls in the tanks to Ukraine,</p>
<p>we respond with our own tanks and start World War III?</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>Does it also mean when he rolls in the tanks,</p>
<p>we wash our hands of Ukraine?</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>If Putin does roll in the tanks and hoist the Russian flag</p>
<p>over Kiev, there must be a price.</p>
<p>And he needs to understand that, in the words of Sting,</p>
<p>the Russians love their children too.</p>
<p>And Russian mothers will not tolerate Putin any longer</p>
<p>if those zinc coffins start coming home from Kiev.</p>
<p>I wonder about that.</p>
<p>Because I also think that this gets back to what you and I</p>
<p>were saying earlier about the differences authoritarian</p>
<p>or more authoritarian regimes have in controlling.</p>
<p>I mean, for example, once upon a time during the Vietnam War,</p>
<p>we saw the coffins coming back to the United States flag</p>
<p>draped, and they were on the media, they were on the news.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t do that anymore ourselves.</p>
<p>But the Russians and the Chinese can completely</p>
<p>control that.</p>
<p>I mean, they could lie about the numbers,</p>
<p>and you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do anything about it.</p>
<p>Funny you should say that.</p>
<p>A little piece of history, that&rsquo;s actually false.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s false?</p>
<p>We know now, through unclassified historical</p>
<p>documents, that in the height of the Soviet-Afghan conflict,</p>
<p>when we fought, right?</p>
<p>We thought that Soviets could do whatever they want.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>They could throw as many lives into that furnace</p>
<p>as they wanted.</p>
<p>We know now that the war was deeply unpopular, to the point</p>
<p>that the casualty trains, the trains coming back into Moscow,</p>
<p>bringing in those zinc coffins, came in at night</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t want the Soviet people to see</p>
<p>the casualties stacking up.</p>
<p>Even authoritarian regimes are vulnerable</p>
<p>and are casualty averse, because sometimes it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t come down to the form of government.</p>
<p>Sometimes it comes down to the culture.</p>
<p>We know Russian culture, they want the spoils of war,</p>
<p>as Churchill said, without having to fight the war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very different when Nazi armies are slicing</p>
<p>through the motherland.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when they&rsquo;ll give up anything.</p>
<p>But would Russian mothers now want</p>
<p>to risk their darling sons for a piece of the Ukraine?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s going to be the key,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s going to be the goal.</p>
<p>Is the goal seen as worth the cost, right?</p>
<p>And so I think with Afghanistan, you&rsquo;d already,</p>
<p>what did they sink into that, a decade before it ended?</p>
<p>And one of those things where I think, like we did too,</p>
<p>eventually you look at it and the various lines on the paper</p>
<p>are not intersecting at the right place,</p>
<p>and you just go, OK, oh, it&rsquo;s like the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>When you decide, what did the Pentagon papers say?</p>
<p>That the government knows that we can&rsquo;t win,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t get out either.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s going to be this moment where, OK, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>five years away from getting out.</p>
<p>We have to stabilize things on the ground</p>
<p>before we can get out.</p>
<p>And then you lose half your people</p>
<p>after you already figured out it was over.</p>
<p>OK, but that&rsquo;s good stuff about the Soviets.</p>
<p>And I actually, I agree with that.</p>
<p>But I also would point out that that was a country that</p>
<p>by 79, 80, 81, and that&rsquo;s right when they went in,</p>
<p>was already in trouble.</p>
<p>And by the time they got out, what was it, four or five years</p>
<p>that they lasted after the withdrawal from Afghanistan</p>
<p>before we had Boris Yeltsin and a brand</p>
<p>new Russian Federation?</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Well, and this is what I mean about asymmetry.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m talking about stopping Putin,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the best way to stop Putin from invading Ukraine?</p>
<p>Is it Javelin missiles?</p>
<p>And is it tanks and planes?</p>
<p>Or is it a negotiated settlement with Western Europe</p>
<p>to stop the gas from pipeline?</p>
<p>So therefore, the United States or North America</p>
<p>becomes the number one natural gas supplier for Western Europe</p>
<p>and not Russia.</p>
<p>Which one gives us more leverage?</p>
<p>But OK, so this is where I&rsquo;m going to take you to task.</p>
<p>Because this, to me, is the same thing.</p>
<p>Which one gives us more leverage?</p>
<p>Which, I mean, this is all part of the competition.</p>
<p>Instead of going to the Russians and maybe saying,</p>
<p>were we in your shoes, we would not</p>
<p>want Russian assets in Mexico, right?</p>
<p>We just wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t allow it, right?</p>
<p>So we understand what&rsquo;s involved here.</p>
<p>And of course, we also understand Russia&rsquo;s history,</p>
<p>how often it&rsquo;s been invaded.</p>
<p>If you were to say that that country had</p>
<p>the equivalent of a national PTSD complex,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t argue with you, right?</p>
<p>They have every reason to be afraid of invasion,</p>
<p>is what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>Look at their national eagle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got two faces pointing east and west.</p>
<p>Yeah, and people, I mean, the trauma of that place</p>
<p>is palpable and understandable.</p>
<p>So knowing all these things, my grandfather was a salesman.</p>
<p>And at his funeral, somebody said</p>
<p>he was a great salesman because he could always see things</p>
<p>from the other side of the fence, right?</p>
<p>With the other side.</p>
<p>If you went to Putin and you said, listen,</p>
<p>I understand what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>What if we talked about a band of demilitarized states</p>
<p>on your border, right?</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t, I mean, this is the Romney,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to play Star Trek, this</p>
<p>is the Romulan neutral zone, right?</p>
<p>In other words, you can&rsquo;t do it and we can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>But this is a way to tell you that we</p>
<p>have no bad intentions.</p>
<p>I know what would happen.</p>
<p>It would start to be the commercial inroads,</p>
<p>and that would all be the things that cause trouble.</p>
<p>But I think right there, you would be showing that,</p>
<p>because I feel like, this is a terrible thing to say,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re on, but I feel like the West really</p>
<p>pushed their advantage after the fall of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>And this would be a way to do what you were saying,</p>
<p>where you would essentially say diplomacy,</p>
<p>and you would say, we understand your problem.</p>
<p>How about this as a solution that works for everybody?</p>
<p>And then you could also put the safeguards in place,</p>
<p>which would say, for the people in Ukraine,</p>
<p>for example, that have every right</p>
<p>to not want to be invaded.</p>
<p>This neutral zone, if violated, and of course,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m setting up Belgium in the First World War again.</p>
<p>But I mean, if this area were invaded,</p>
<p>then we would consider that to be a terrible violation</p>
<p>of a neutral country that the rest of the world</p>
<p>has acknowledged is neutral.</p>
<p>Like I said, I&rsquo;m just setting up World War III</p>
<p>by setting up World War I again.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s, I mean, maybe something</p>
<p>like that is how you diffuse situations rather than trying</p>
<p>to gain leverage in an ongoing eternal struggle</p>
<p>against Russia and China.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what I mean, is where does the power</p>
<p>of your enemy come from?</p>
<p>You know, like what I said, when dealing with Russia,</p>
<p>which is casualty averse, and we know this.</p>
<p>We know the Russians do not want,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want to be bathed in blood.</p>
<p>They want the spoils of war without the war.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very different than dealing</p>
<p>with someplace like Hamas, which only has outrage and revenge</p>
<p>as their power base.</p>
<p>The worst thing that you could do for Hamas</p>
<p>would be to declare peace, because then they</p>
<p>would be exposed.</p>
<p>Instead of glorious freedom fighters,</p>
<p>they would be a bunch of screw ups who can&rsquo;t pave a road.</p>
<p>So they live on violence.</p>
<p>They require violence in order to exist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not Russia, and that&rsquo;s not China.</p>
<p>The threat of violence is a card to be played in negotiation</p>
<p>the same way information warfare, economic warfare,</p>
<p>energy warfare.</p>
<p>The Russians are the masters of energy warfare.</p>
<p>And we need to step that up, and we need to understand this.</p>
<p>Our enemies, like I said, going back to the beginning,</p>
<p>they understand how to play every key on this piano called</p>
<p>international relations, and we just</p>
<p>keep banging on that deep one.</p>
<p>Max, have I not asked you, is there</p>
<p>something I haven&rsquo;t brought up in this conversation,</p>
<p>something you&rsquo;d like to get into?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re at about 1.22 now, and I&rsquo;m happy to go</p>
<p>wherever you want to go.</p>
<p>And listen, I hope you don&rsquo;t take this the wrong way.</p>
<p>It is a devil&rsquo;s hour.</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s just a better conversation when you and I go</p>
<p>back and forth, rather than me asking questions</p>
<p>and you answering.</p>
<p>I hope that&rsquo;s OK.</p>
<p>No, I mean, listen, I know you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to admit this to the people listening,</p>
<p>but you and I have both been on Bill Maher.</p>
<p>And Bill&rsquo;s whole thing is you can disagree, and we disagree.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the great thing.</p>
<p>I would much rather be, if you and I were both Chinese</p>
<p>and we were on the history podcast,</p>
<p>Hardcore History in China, it would</p>
<p>be called the glorious history of the perfection</p>
<p>that is the Chinese people.</p>
<p>The celestial heavenly kingdom, yes.</p>
<p>And then we would just be complimenting Xi Jinping</p>
<p>and all the Chinese, and that would be it.</p>
<p>So no, the debate is good.</p>
<p>Through the debate, we get to the answers.</p>
<p>So I mean, I think one other thing that we haven&rsquo;t hit on,</p>
<p>because I always wanted to talk to you about this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a history, you&rsquo;re Roman history, right?</p>
<p>Some of it, yeah.</p>
<p>Right, you know Roman history.</p>
<p>This is the example.</p>
<p>When we talk about the ability to self-correct</p>
<p>and the Roman Republic, how many consuls</p>
<p>did they go through before they got to Scipio Africanus?</p>
<p>Well, a lot.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Imagine if they had just had one emperor.</p>
<p>Well, I like, I&rsquo;m seeing the value in the consul,</p>
<p>the two consul system more and more these days.</p>
<p>I have to tell you, I&rsquo;m starting to wonder if we wouldn&rsquo;t benefit</p>
<p>from something like that a little bit.</p>
<p>As I look at the downsides of our own system right now,</p>
<p>because Max, I truly believe this isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an existential test for our system,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re going through right now.</p>
<p>And I think the social media is sort</p>
<p>of the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>I mean, we sort of referenced either directly or indirectly</p>
<p>the Alvin Toffler future shock type conversation earlier.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re in right now.</p>
<p>And I think this is trying to figure out</p>
<p>how we&rsquo;re going to wrestle.</p>
<p>Like we said, once upon a time, radio-free Europe</p>
<p>was seen as a dangerous, destabilizing thing,</p>
<p>if not from the people behind it,</p>
<p>then the people on the other end of it, right, the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Well, now you&rsquo;ve got zillions of radio-free Europe.</p>
<p>And everybody&rsquo;s got them, and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pointed in every direction.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re like a, I mean, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a great giant experiment with all these nation</p>
<p>states as guinea pigs.</p>
<p>I had a conversation with James Burke from Connections</p>
<p>in the day the universe changed.</p>
<p>And he said that he thought it was very possible</p>
<p>that the very forces that made nation states a good idea</p>
<p>once upon a time, right, where size mattered</p>
<p>and all that sort of stuff, that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>And that maybe the idea that, you know,</p>
<p>the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia type nation state thing</p>
<p>has run its course, and that people</p>
<p>would be able to form virtual type nations</p>
<p>through communities and whatnot in multiple countries</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;re not, I mean, obviously, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some long-term development that would be</p>
<p>needed to make that possible.</p>
<p>But I think the idea is interesting when</p>
<p>we start thinking about, where does all this lead?</p>
<p>Either, you know, the Max Brooks self-correction</p>
<p>towards the nation states solidifying and repurposing</p>
<p>again, or maybe a de-evolution to something different</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t even imagine, yet made possible</p>
<p>by all this technology, interconnectivity,</p>
<p>and yes, the stresses and strains</p>
<p>that are heaping up in our country</p>
<p>to the point where we&rsquo;re ready to kill each other.</p>
<p>Well, you know, I think that that&rsquo;s very possible.</p>
<p>What the hell do I know about what the future will bring?</p>
<p>Same here, baby.</p>
<p>Same here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll know when we get there.</p>
<p>But what I will say is what I, and I&rsquo;m like you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a professional historian.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a history major.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing you were too.</p>
<p>Yeah, totally.</p>
<p>And what I have taken from American history</p>
<p>is a constant series of addiction and self-correction.</p>
<p>Something is starting, you know, something is working for us.</p>
<p>We love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And then eventually, there is a heavy bill to pay.</p>
<p>And sometimes it&rsquo;s huge, like slavery.</p>
<p>There was a very heavy bill.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still paying for that one.</p>
<p>And sometimes it&rsquo;s something like oil, you know,</p>
<p>made a lot of people rich, made us very powerful very fast.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re now paying for that one.</p>
<p>But I do always see the ability of America to be better</p>
<p>because I believe, and I see it, our whole national identity</p>
<p>is built on fighting the good fight.</p>
<p>We understood this even in our Constitution, right?</p>
<p>The idea that it doesn&rsquo;t say a perfect union.</p>
<p>It says a more perfect union.</p>
<p>Even our founders understood that humans are imperfect</p>
<p>and that the American experiment is not about being great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about fighting to be better than we already are.</p>
<p>And I see that.</p>
<p>No matter what you say about where we are</p>
<p>and all the trials, even in my short little life</p>
<p>of almost half a century, I have seen</p>
<p>so much incredible progress in this country.</p>
<p>The America that I grew up in, the social freedoms</p>
<p>and the tolerances, the people who were not even</p>
<p>allowed to exist when I was a kid</p>
<p>are now free and equal to me.</p>
<p>The fact, and you know more than me,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m going to challenge you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always challenged people on this.</p>
<p>Maybe you can prove me wrong.</p>
<p>Find me another civilization where our recent president</p>
<p>could have been a slave of our first president.</p>
<p>Has any civilization made this much social progress this fast</p>
<p>without a gun to its head?</p>
<p>Because Germany and Japan did that,</p>
<p>but they had a gun to its head.</p>
<p>Has any other civilization made this much progress</p>
<p>in this short a time on its own by its own force of will?</p>
<p>The historian that neither of us really are officially</p>
<p>would say that progress is a culturally specific sort</p>
<p>of an attitude.</p>
<p>And what we would consider to be progress,</p>
<p>we would be measuring other countries by a standard</p>
<p>that they wouldn&rsquo;t think of as progress at all.</p>
<p>Which is exactly why I&rsquo;m proud to be an American.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve traveled all around this world.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen other countries.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen other so-called great powers.</p>
<p>And they look around and they go, we&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>This is it.</p>
<p>This is us.</p>
<p>This is who we want to be.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re totally OK with it.</p>
<p>And then I come back to America, and I</p>
<p>see this constant growing pain of always reaching</p>
<p>towards the light.</p>
<p>And sometimes we fall back, and sometimes we go forward.</p>
<p>But that fight for the light makes</p>
<p>me proud to be an American.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always said, Max, I want an America that lives up</p>
<p>to the marketing materials.</p>
<p>My friend, thank you so much for coming on the program.</p>
<p>These are the kind of conversations I have for fun.</p>
<p>So thank you for providing a really entertaining afternoon</p>
<p>for me.</p>
<p>Thank you, Dan.</p>
<p>And I look forward to your next 11-hour Hardcore History</p>
<p>podcast.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>Thanks, man.</p>
<p>Listen, hopefully, you and I will be in the same room</p>
<p>before too long again.</p>
<p>You bet, buddy.</p>
<p>My thanks to Max Brooks for coming on the program.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the conversation.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t mind doing that one again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of fun.</p>
<p>And I know there&rsquo;s 9,000 things I&rsquo;m supposed to tell you.</p>
<p>But with the Hardcore History temporary brain</p>
<p>fog that develops at this stage of the process,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember any of them except to say that we said,</p>
<p>we sell the old shows online and iTunes and some other places</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re jonesing for one of the long podcasts</p>
<p>as we work on the current one.</p>
<p>Also, we have some relatively new merch available.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in a hat or a shirt or something like that,</p>
<p>head on over to the website at dancarlin.com</p>
<p>and check that out.</p>
<p>And thanks for all the support and patience, folks.</p>
<p>We are working on the big show, I promise.</p>
<p>And as usual, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s any good or not.</p>
<p>I hope you like it.</p>
<p>Whenever the heck we finish it, stay safe, everyone.</p>
<p>If you think the show you just heard is worth a dollar,</p>
<p>Dan and Ben would love to have it.</p>
<p>A buck a show, it&rsquo;s all we ask.</p>
<p>Go to dancarlin.com for information</p>
<p>on how to donate to the show.</p>
