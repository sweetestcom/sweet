<p>Joe sits down with Todd McKormick.</p>
<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>
<p>herbs and they move shit around and put</p>
<p>things in weird places</p>
<p>and when you read the</p>
<p>translation like what the fuck does this mean</p>
<p>well they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>figuring out how to</p>
<p>translate it not just both word for word but</p>
<p>figuring out how you</p>
<p>would say that same sentence in english to</p>
<p>structure as well yeah so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>clear what what you know what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>translating it&rsquo;s fucking fascinating shit man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating and i also wonder after</p>
<p>50 or so years of everybody</p>
<p>using english on the internet how many kids are</p>
<p>going to grow up</p>
<p>just as english as their</p>
<p>you know their new language and their</p>
<p>original languages like the old fashioned</p>
<p>thing their parents did</p>
<p>could you imagine if there was only one language</p>
<p>could you imagine how much shit</p>
<p>would get done well can you you know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting though when you say that like imagine</p>
<p>languages are</p>
<p>gonna go away by</p>
<p>technology very very very fast no</p>
<p>languages well so what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen i</p>
<p>think translator</p>
<p>might out you</p>
<p>know like you&rsquo;ll just sit there and</p>
<p>have something</p>
<p>translate it to you in real time you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be</p>
<p>voice detection</p>
<p>and everything like that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just going to make</p>
<p>languages languages though people are</p>
<p>still going to want</p>
<p>traditionalists will</p>
<p>still be there playing with</p>
<p>their whole</p>
<p>thing but what if a few</p>
<p>generations go by</p>
<p>right i think</p>
<p>things are gonna change profoundly</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re a proponent of the isolation tank you</p>
<p>actually have john lilley&rsquo;s tank don&rsquo;t you i actually</p>
<p>after i met</p>
<p>john he gave me his tanks</p>
<p>john willie&rsquo;s isolation</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re my only</p>
<p>other friend that ever had one that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like having willie mays is fucking baseball bat</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s cool i got a shower</p>
<p>shoes to go with it</p>
<p>oh so i actually get out and walk in issues</p>
<p>every time i go from my</p>
<p>dad&rsquo;s to the shower raising</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not high heels</p>
<p>right now i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>pretty boring</p>
<p>brown shower</p>
<p>shoes but imagine when they figure out how to</p>
<p>stimulate the mind to create certain states</p>
<p>and they do it in conjunction with the tank</p>
<p>which is really</p>
<p>the way to do it because it eliminates all the sensory</p>
<p>input from this</p>
<p>world if they</p>
<p>could figure out how to do that put some</p>
<p>electrodes on your head</p>
<p>and set you in that fucking tank</p>
<p>and light you up like a christmas tree</p>
<p>and you just go into some</p>
<p>other world then</p>
<p>maybe people will stop talking i</p>
<p>think dr lily did that to me with one</p>
<p>cc ketamine injected you know</p>
<p>yeah you told me</p>
<p>about that what a rush</p>
<p>yeah what did he do what did he do exactly</p>
<p>well when i got there actually they</p>
<p>i was gonna go into the tank just you know</p>
<p>straight and</p>
<p>when i you got a</p>
<p>rinse off and</p>
<p>everything before</p>
<p>you go in the tank and the guy was prepping</p>
<p>me and he says you know</p>
<p>usually when we do it</p>
<p>we go in with one</p>
<p>cc injected</p>
<p>in a muscularly you know</p>
<p>ketamine you know</p>
<p>would you like some and i hear</p>
<p>part of my brain go</p>
<p>no no drugs</p>
<p>thanks and then i hear</p>
<p>my mouth go oh</p>
<p>absolutely i&rsquo;d love some</p>
<p>and and then i i felt like a complete</p>
<p>third person in my own reality because</p>
<p>he said no problem you know it&rsquo;s injected</p>
<p>in a muscully is that a problem in my side of my</p>
<p>brain with needles no</p>
<p>my mouth however went</p>
<p>no problem that&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>great if you want to find them yeah</p>
<p>and you know and i and he walked away to go get me the</p>
<p>stuff and i sit there for a</p>
<p>minute and my</p>
<p>brain was saying</p>
<p>no way and and my</p>
<p>other side of my</p>
<p>brain went look you&rsquo;re at dr lily&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house man you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>come all this way there&rsquo;s no way you&rsquo;re saying no</p>
<p>and he walked</p>
<p>back in and i felt a little alcohol swab on my muscle</p>
<p>and i heard my</p>
<p>brain go no</p>
<p>and then i heard my mouth go</p>
<p>thank you very much</p>
<p>and then i made the most naive</p>
<p>sorry i said</p>
<p>how long does it take to kick in</p>
<p>and i will never forget</p>
<p>his face when he went</p>
<p>you haven&rsquo;t done it before</p>
<p>oh you should lay down</p>
<p>about 45 seconds</p>
<p>and he like put me in the tank and when</p>
<p>you do what if you do something like that you have</p>
<p>sleep apnea</p>
<p>do you run the risk of choking and not breathing</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>sleep apnea but the last thing i was thinking</p>
<p>about was sleeping when he</p>
<p>slipped me into that tank i thought i was there to</p>
<p>watch the entire world come to an end</p>
<p>and i had a ringside seat it was pretty interesting</p>
<p>so they shot</p>
<p>you up with this ketamine you lie down the tank</p>
<p>yeah you get into the tank and you</p>
<p>float and for me it was the</p>
<p>first experience ever</p>
<p>floating in one of the tanks so your</p>
<p>first experience</p>
<p>floating was with ketamine</p>
<p>yeah it happens</p>
<p>you know how do you say no to dr lily</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;d</p>
<p>watched the</p>
<p>movie altered states</p>
<p>dozens of times i&rsquo;d own the</p>
<p>laser disc that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>after after you did</p>
<p>personally 45 seconds in</p>
<p>i thought i was</p>
<p>freaking out and</p>
<p>the funnier side of this was my good friend was in the</p>
<p>other room and i was</p>
<p>background panic</p>
<p>noise while all this was</p>
<p>going on and he didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about the ketamine</p>
<p>entering into the equation</p>
<p>and he was sitting there</p>
<p>with dr lily and his assistant at the time craig and</p>
<p>they had no concern of me like</p>
<p>sounding like i&rsquo;m drowning</p>
<p>and finally</p>
<p>he asked you know</p>
<p>is he on ketamine and</p>
<p>craig said yes and he said</p>
<p>would you go get me some</p>
<p>and my friend was totally</p>
<p>blown away didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that was</p>
<p>gonna be the answer</p>
<p>to the problem</p>
<p>and john put some ketamine</p>
<p>into his leg and told my friend have a nice night</p>
<p>and he went into his bedroom</p>
<p>and my friend</p>
<p>could see into the bedroom</p>
<p>where the tank was next to a bed</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>touch the tank</p>
<p>he just went in and laid down next to the bed</p>
<p>and i actually stopped</p>
<p>screaming at that</p>
<p>point and my friend was looking in the bedroom he was</p>
<p>screaming i was</p>
<p>freaking out man and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>fucking losing my mind also okay</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re in the tank</p>
<p>and she grew up with a panic</p>
<p>you panic you</p>
<p>start screaming</p>
<p>john lilly says</p>
<p>give me some of</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s having yeah and honestly for me i felt like</p>
<p>well when i stopped</p>
<p>screaming i remembered it was conscious</p>
<p>i i mean it felt like somebody came into</p>
<p>my trip and just said yo take a deep breath calm down</p>
<p>and and i was like okay</p>
<p>and and you know what i just channeled the energy and</p>
<p>and it actually</p>
<p>really positive</p>
<p>experience john lilly joined you in your trip</p>
<p>what if he joined you in the actual isolation</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t me and my</p>
<p>girlfriend later on</p>
<p>tried to get</p>
<p>it it&rsquo;s like that dentist</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a cool</p>
<p>place for to</p>
<p>have a friend</p>
<p>that saw tits</p>
<p>yeah come here let&rsquo;s cuddle it</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t work but</p>
<p>you know what in a</p>
<p>sense yes i feel like he did i felt like</p>
<p>there was a telepathic communication as much as this is</p>
<p>gonna blow all of the credibility i just had</p>
<p>about talking</p>
<p>about pot yeah</p>
<p>i actually felt like dr lily and i</p>
<p>communicated on a</p>
<p>level that was more telepathic during the time i was</p>
<p>under the drug</p>
<p>and you think do you</p>
<p>think like the tank even</p>
<p>have a story</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to believe it</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t care you think</p>
<p>the tank would</p>
<p>even work though if he</p>
<p>took the same amount</p>
<p>of pills and just laid on something can i tell you</p>
<p>something the tank that no i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think the pill</p>
<p>or i wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that your</p>
<p>environment</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s how here&rsquo;s how the tank&rsquo;s huge right</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s huge</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s how mckenna described ketamine</p>
<p>he said that it was like</p>
<p>he believed that when you did</p>
<p>psychedelics</p>
<p>you somehow are another connected to the</p>
<p>experience that everybody had</p>
<p>had doing those</p>
<p>psychedelics before you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why the mushroom</p>
<p>experience is so rich and diverse it says</p>
<p>thousands and</p>
<p>thousands and millions</p>
<p>of people over the years have done mushrooms and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>connected to this one big gigantic growing experience</p>
<p>he said doing ketamine</p>
<p>he said ketamine is so much more rare that really</p>
<p>it gave him the feeling like he was in an abandoned a</p>
<p>warehouse or an office</p>
<p>building with no</p>
<p>furniture in it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>i felt very</p>
<p>alone in my trip</p>
<p>initially and then when i felt like there was another</p>
<p>energy around me</p>
<p>it did feel different and it was</p>
<p>weird i had a long conversation with</p>
<p>john lilly after it and he really he was</p>
<p>i really liked</p>
<p>the old guy he was really a nice guy and then</p>
<p>afterwards when i left whatever the next day</p>
<p>his assistant showed up and said you made a real</p>
<p>impression on john he&rsquo;d like you to have his tank</p>
<p>okay just gave it to you</p>
<p>yeah wow that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy he probably felt bad</p>
<p>he probably didn&rsquo;t want you to sue him for fucking</p>
<p>whacking him with ketamine and</p>
<p>throwing him</p>
<p>into a fucking bathtub</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like this dude</p>
<p>might sue me</p>
<p>man i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>work this i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna work this i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna stroke it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna call him up and say yo man you are the shit</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m gonna give you my tank oh</p>
<p>you know oliver</p>
<p>stone went the</p>
<p>night before me in his tank</p>
<p>yeah yeah and what</p>
<p>if he peed in</p>
<p>there yeah he took off</p>
<p>a huge shit and</p>
<p>i never really thought</p>
<p>about that i</p>
<p>never really thought</p>
<p>about that until</p>
<p>just this video</p>
<p>i would have</p>
<p>definitely no</p>
<p>he did k though and did it and it</p>
<p>was yeah we both did it yeah we got to talk</p>
<p>about it years</p>
<p>later him and i sit down and chat</p>
<p>about our weekend at john&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wow what a fucking</p>
<p>freaky dude</p>
<p>whack people</p>
<p>out with hair with a special k</p>
<p>and throw them into a fucking tank of</p>
<p>water you do know</p>
<p>this is the guy that the day of the dolphin was made</p>
<p>about he&rsquo;s the guy that did</p>
<p>all of the research on</p>
<p>books all of</p>
<p>them you have</p>
<p>oh he&rsquo;s a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker he was awesome he&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>great book where he actually shows</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got um</p>
<p>the deep self has directions on how to make a tank</p>
<p>shows you how to make it</p>
<p>well that precurse the sonomari</p>
<p>tank i got isn&rsquo;t it sonomari is</p>
<p>a samadhi samadhi</p>
<p>samadhi yeah that&rsquo;s what i had too</p>
<p>i had one of</p>
<p>those as well</p>
<p>now i got a</p>
<p>float lab one the new</p>
<p>crazy version</p>
<p>have i showed you that</p>
<p>not yet i can see</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the basement</p>
<p>on the trip</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the craziest</p>
<p>thing i think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re awesome</p>
<p>and i think a lot of people have</p>
<p>never really been able to</p>
<p>meditate within</p>
<p>themselves and when you get in this tank and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no resistance on your body and you can actually</p>
<p>really hear and you don&rsquo;t really see</p>
<p>and you feel</p>
<p>the same temperature as the surroundings around you</p>
<p>you really feel so</p>
<p>boundless and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>truly you&rsquo;re flying through</p>
<p>space man it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a spaceship it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>spaceship man</p>
<p>that downstairs is a fucking portal to another</p>
<p>world it really is it really is when you</p>
<p>learn how to</p>
<p>relax once you</p>
<p>learn how to</p>
<p>relax and it takes a few times you have to do it a</p>
<p>bunch of times and depending on your personality</p>
<p>how good you are</p>
<p>truly letting go</p>
<p>but if you really</p>
<p>learn how to let go man you go on trips in that</p>
<p>thing dude i used to</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d set an alarm at like 4 am if i went to</p>
<p>sleep before midnight</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;d just like walk</p>
<p>cause i had mine in my bedroom</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d walk right to my tank get back in it and like</p>
<p>go back to sleep</p>
<p>and like four five six o&rsquo;clock</p>
<p>i would always wake up before seven</p>
<p>feeling like man i had just</p>
<p>slept for so long</p>
<p>and i felt great and my</p>
<p>dreams would be so lucid</p>
<p>so incredibly</p>
<p>real and tangible and holy shit i</p>
<p>wanna go write him down lucy that&rsquo;s intense</p>
<p>so you only had to</p>
<p>walk a couple steps so you barely woke up i barely woke</p>
<p>up and went</p>
<p>right back right back out bam</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>you got it it&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>mine&rsquo;s too far from my fucking bed</p>
<p>in the walking i&rsquo;d wake up</p>
<p>going what the fuck you doing with your life rogan</p>
<p>getting up at</p>
<p>four o&rsquo;clock in the morning you fucking weirdo meditate</p>
<p>and then i&rsquo;ll go on the internet and</p>

<p>about ufos around nuclear</p>
<p>around nuclear</p>
<p>facilities that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>trippy shit man</p>
<p>i wonder if</p>
<p>these guys are all just nuts</p>
<p>i wonder if</p>
<p>these guys are all kooks or if they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>disinformation guys</p>
<p>that work for the government the government wants us to</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s fucking really ufos thing just</p>
<p>just distract a</p>
<p>lot of people and i can yeah and meanwhile</p>
<p>obama&rsquo;s passing on his</p>
<p>legislation</p>
<p>making it easier for people to wire tap your</p>
<p>emails and get into</p>
<p>your fucking twitter account your facebook pages and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re passing all this</p>
<p>legislation</p>
<p>right into everybody&rsquo;s noses</p>
<p>i wonder if</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it is i wonder if it&rsquo;s just a distraction</p>
<p>tactic i truly believe</p>
<p>it is i mean they appointed the un appointed some</p>
<p>chick to be the ambassador when the</p>
<p>aliens come</p>
<p>listen bitch</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t speak for me is that real</p>
<p>yes the un just ant</p>
<p>pointed and what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>fuck&rsquo;s third job</p>
<p>just sit around</p>
<p>and wait she is a i believe she&rsquo;s an astrophysicist</p>
<p>and her job is to communicate with the aliens</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t talk for me hooker can i just say something</p>
<p>i got a dog we have been on this planet</p>
<p>evolving with dogs for thousands of years</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>speak doberman</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t speak german shepherd</p>
<p>and how do we</p>
<p>think that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna show up and</p>
<p>suddenly we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be like sit</p>
<p>right good alien</p>
<p>up it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>hilarious well</p>
<p>up the idea</p>
<p>alien want a</p>
<p>snack is that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be so much more intelligent</p>
<p>now they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be able to</p>
<p>understand what our language is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be able</p>
<p>to decipher our language that&rsquo;s the hope and the dream</p>
<p>i think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna show up and</p>
<p>think food man you look soft and</p>
<p>juicy that&rsquo;s what we do</p>
<p>if you look</p>
<p>these people if you look at what</p>
<p>you look at what do they</p>
<p>just eat us</p>
<p>we be like cows you know</p>
<p>if you look at what</p>
<p>every single</p>
<p>intelligent</p>
<p>life form on this planet does</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>make sure that they exploit</p>
<p>everything weaker than that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the ethic of</p>
<p>space it seems like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the ethic of life</p>
<p>on this planet</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s survival of the fittest</p>
<p>and when you&rsquo;re the fittest you get the fuck</p>
<p>the ones who are not as fit that&rsquo;s just the way it is</p>
<p>what human beings do to dolphins and seaworld</p>
<p>and what we do to killer whales</p>
<p>we know that killer</p>
<p>whales rescue</p>
<p>human beings that fall off boats we know that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never been a case in the wild of a killer whale</p>
<p>a documented case killing a human</p>
<p>the only times they&rsquo;ve ever done</p>
<p>other than seaworld</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only times i&rsquo;ve ever done it</p>
<p>and we know what</p>
<p>dolphins do dolphins kill baby dolphins so they can</p>
<p>force the female dolphin to fuck</p>
<p>dolphins are</p>
<p>ruthless man is that true yes fuck yeah it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>yeah they killed the baby they</p>
<p>killed the babies how do they kill them</p>
<p>they killed</p>
<p>their face are</p>
<p>they kill him yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the reasons</p>
<p>yeah they dolphins rape the fuck out of each other too</p>
<p>and one of the reasons why female dolphins are whores</p>
<p>female dolphins are</p>
<p>super slutty and the reason being is because</p>
<p>they have to fuck as many male dolphins as possible</p>
<p>so that when they have babies</p>
<p>those male dolphins won&rsquo;t kill the babies</p>
<p>so the male dolphin will go</p>
<p>i could be mine</p>
<p>some might be mine damn</p>
<p>they like her</p>
<p>cause they they get the fucker would you</p>
<p>take this so</p>
<p>from documenters</p>
<p>and so the the</p>
<p>the idea being that the</p>
<p>mother does not</p>
<p>breed while she&rsquo;s with the baby so it takes</p>
<p>like six years or something like that before she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to breed</p>
<p>again oh before she</p>
<p>breeds again before she breeds</p>
<p>again because just take care of the baby how well</p>
<p>how long does dolphin live</p>
<p>good question i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know but you need</p>
<p>to know a lot</p>
<p>about their sex life dolphins</p>
<p>freak freak</p>
<p>fucking one of those</p>
<p>for a while</p>
<p>if it only had a</p>
<p>sheep&rsquo;s pussy</p>
<p>but it was a dolphin right</p>
<p>be in there son</p>
<p>put those two together</p>
<p>yeah if you get fuck</p>
<p>it and it could drag you through the</p>
<p>water the same yeah</p>
<p>take you on trips you like</p>
<p>40 miles an</p>
<p>hour better be able to hold your breath</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna need to design some new dolphin</p>
<p>they can fuck</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>or maybe you</p>
<p>could just climb on the back of a dolphin</p>
<p>just get a flashlight</p>
<p>attached to the dolphin</p>
<p>you fuck that could be</p>
<p>i heard it already feels good there&rsquo;s</p>

<p>eddie long another</p>
<p>christian man in a position of power</p>
<p>that it turns out was actually banging boys</p>

<p>what if what if</p>
<p>like the catholic church has been run by gays who are</p>
<p>angry at the straight people this whole time</p>
<p>right and they get to wear</p>
<p>their dresses</p>
<p>and have their fabulous cars and their</p>
<p>drink out of</p>
<p>their gold chalices</p>
<p>and be covered in all</p>
<p>these colors</p>
<p>and live in</p>
<p>total secrecy</p>
<p>and then pick out</p>
<p>the little gay kids</p>
<p>right out of the</p>
<p>straight audience the flaw</p>
<p>is that they think</p>
<p>hate madonna</p>
<p>whoa what do you mean madonna</p>
<p>the churches hate madonna you know</p>
<p>gay people love madonna</p>
<p>love madonna</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s therefore your</p>
<p>analysis does</p>
<p>not hold water</p>
<p>oh i think it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you</p>
<p>think it is i say ancient gay cult yeah</p>
<p>insults pope</p>
<p>wearing a dress</p>

<p>dream about getting off well how</p>
<p>about salt peter</p>
<p>that shit they give them to keep them from getting</p>
<p>horny that&rsquo;s not true</p>

<p>those urban</p>
<p>legend type</p>
<p>things but total</p>
<p>urban legend the</p>
<p>whole idea is</p>
<p>ridiculous the</p>
<p>whole idea that anybody</p>
<p>would ask you to not have sex</p>
<p>like why would god give me a dick</p>
<p>if i didn&rsquo;t want to use it god don&rsquo;t procreate go yeah</p>

<p>love someone i love how people that talk</p>
<p>about you know there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>evolution there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just creationism they don&rsquo;t want to talk</p>
<p>about incestual relations between adam and eve and all</p>
<p>their kids yeah which is</p>
<p>where the fuck that come from god</p>
<p>show up again with a new boat</p>

<p>and then they did all this in 6 000 years</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s up you&rsquo;re my brother</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s my christian</p>
<p>brother don&rsquo;t eat that apple</p>
<p>which is bad</p>

<p>i love that in the</p>
<p>union that was the</p>
<p>first prohibition</p>
<p>the prohibition of thou</p>
<p>shall not eat from the tree of knowledge</p>
<p>and who was the big cop</p>
<p>right god and</p>
<p>how many people</p>
<p>two two people he had to police and god</p>
<p>according to christian mythology</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t handle prohibition</p>
<p>yeah how hilarious is it god</p>
<p>would make some shit that he didn&rsquo;t want you to eat and</p>
<p>tell you don&rsquo;t eat it i&rsquo;m telling you i will fuck your</p>
<p>world up oh oh</p>
<p>oh you ate the</p>
<p>apple that i told you not to eat</p>

<p>you don&rsquo;t ever get a</p>
<p>second chance</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fucked forever your</p>
<p>whole species is fucked</p>
<p>joe do you ever wonder if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>do you wonder if that</p>
<p>snake that one</p>
<p>snake the original</p>
<p>snake ever made it</p>
<p>if he made it on noah&rsquo;s ark</p>
<p>do you ever think</p>
<p>about that like no wonder that</p>
<p>snake was the devil</p>
<p>it was really a serpent</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how much</p>
<p>i know i was just like</p>
<p>i was hoping that</p>
<p>snake made it maybe that</p>
<p>snake is all around us all the time yeah</p>
<p>pretty much</p>
<p>the whole idea that you know they&rsquo;ll make fun of</p>
<p>fucking muslims or that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll make fun of</p>
<p>scientologists they&rsquo;ll make fun of</p>
<p>you know like oh they&rsquo;ve got the</p>
<p>wrong thing well</p>
<p>you better come to</p>
<p>jesus well see i</p>
<p>argue that everybody&rsquo;s an atheist because a jew</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t believe in a christian god and a christian god</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t believe in buddha</p>
<p>and a buddha</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>in a jewish god and none of them believe in muhammad</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s really they&rsquo;re all atheists</p>
<p>cause they don&rsquo;t believe in</p>
<p>anything but</p>
<p>their little fantasy</p>
<p>truthfully so they&rsquo;re all atheists</p>
<p>to somebody else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shit to somebody else&rsquo;s shit they don&rsquo;t believe in</p>
<p>their other god so bam</p>
<p>suddenly we&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>alignment i just don&rsquo;t also believe with any of</p>
<p>their gods it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>amazing that there are so many different religions</p>
<p>hundreds literally</p>
<p>we were neat</p>
<p>we were lost we needed direction we</p>
<p>need someone to woke up and go i know</p>
<p>where the food is</p>
<p>i know where you&rsquo;ll be warm i</p>
<p>know how to heal you sick when you die and come with me</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s amazing that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many different religions but even though</p>
<p>we know that they all say different shit everyone</p>
<p>is willing to go</p>
<p>believing that the one they believe is right</p>
<p>even though</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many examples of contradicting ideas</p>
<p>for whatever fucking reason we compartmentalize</p>
<p>that when we you know go down the road of being</p>
<p>a mormon or go down the road of being a catholic or a</p>
<p>baptist we just</p>
<p>which you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>look at it just don&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>say this is my team and</p>
<p>screw your team</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a very ten nfl</p>
<p>mentality you know rah</p>
<p>rah my team boo your team</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all the same shit</p>
<p>it is all the same shit when i was indiana</p>
<p>i was in indiana for ufc</p>
<p>anybody who</p>
<p>fought somebody from indiana even if they were american</p>
<p>they would boom</p>
<p>really you&rsquo;re not from indiana boo</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s our local boy</p>
<p>hoosiers but</p>
<p>think about indiana is</p>
<p>great don&rsquo;t get me</p>
<p>wrong but the</p>
<p>mentality is so fucked up</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re booing against</p>
<p>other americans</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re not from a similar place</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not within a certain distance of</p>
<p>where you sleep</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re there you don&rsquo;t even like him</p>
<p>right now who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going up against our guy</p>
<p>like we need we don&rsquo;t just have americans</p>
<p>versus the rest of the world</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll go down to neighborhoods</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll break it down to neighborhoods</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll break it down to the hatfields and the mccoys</p>
<p>you know the problem with</p>
<p>indiana is there&rsquo;s nothing else to fucking do there</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>known for much in indiana</p>
<p>and so that</p>
<p>movie hoosiers came out everyone was like</p>
<p>sports is now our big</p>
<p>thing so now it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>seriously the</p>
<p>movie came out because</p>
<p>sports is a big</p>
<p>thing right</p>
<p>right right but they&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>proud of that</p>
<p>movie and that</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s all they have</p>
<p>living in indianapolis they</p>
<p>used to have this</p>
<p>thing called the indianapolis</p>
<p>500 that was</p>
<p>kind of big</p>
<p>direct mix too</p>
<p>yeah they have a lot of shit dude</p>
<p>yeah so it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>important to see</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve gotta</p>
<p>bring farming back to the midwest is what we</p>
<p>gotta do we</p>
<p>gotta really farming you</p>
<p>bring it back to weed right weed</p>
<p>man but hemp we need hemp</p>
<p>man i know look</p>
<p>farmaid right now is in its</p>
<p>25th year and the</p>
<p>problem with it is 25 years and they&rsquo;ve gotten where</p>
<p>because all</p>
<p>these people they&rsquo;re trying to convince</p>
<p>they built their</p>
<p>their farms on corn and cotton</p>
<p>are completely</p>
<p>wrong and they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna have any economic independence back</p>
<p>until they get</p>
<p>their hemp back</p>
<p>and again as</p>
<p>john cougar melankamp came onto the</p>
<p>screen and they boot him</p>
<p>really boom in indiana</p>
<p>yep he&rsquo;s from indiana is</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get the cue</p>
<p>card he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>liberal always</p>
<p>liberal fucking really wow</p>
<p>it was crazy</p>
<p>they showed him i expected everybody to go ape shit</p>
<p>wow boo you know in ohio the farms are</p>
<p>getting so bad that they&rsquo;re like closing farms left and</p>
<p>right that a lot of the farms are turning into</p>
<p>shopping centers</p>
<p>where my mom lived</p>
<p>just in five years used to be farms everywhere</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s like commercial</p>
<p>buildings and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re losing all</p>
<p>these farms because there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>money in it or something&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going on right</p>
<p>in the farming industry in ohio well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to run a farm and make a profit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredibly difficult it&rsquo;s so fucking hard</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re up</p>
<p>against unfair</p>
<p>trade practices and fucking fuels that come from 9 000</p>
<p>miles away well how</p>
<p>about seeds you know you don&rsquo;t even own your seeds</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a farmer when you get seeds from</p>
<p>those a big</p>
<p>deal and you know what hemp is the one</p>
<p>thing that we need to really</p>
<p>push that we don&rsquo;t have gmo control of we have to</p>
<p>stand up and ask for</p>
<p>but you know our</p>
<p>civil rights</p>
<p>back we have to demand them in back in fact i mean</p>
<p>when we are well let&rsquo;s explain the</p>
<p>seeds thing though what i was saying is going it</p>
<p>when you buy seeds if you&rsquo;re a farmer you buy</p>
<p>these seeds that have been made by this company</p>
<p>monsanto yeah you don&rsquo;t own</p>
<p>those seeds you go you got</p>
<p>those seeds and when you</p>
<p>plant your new plants</p>
<p>and you grow like</p>
<p>say if you grow peppers you can&rsquo;t take the seeds out of</p>
<p>those peppers</p>
<p>and grow more peppers</p>
<p>cause you don&rsquo;t own that right</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t own that</p>
<p>they will sue you they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>copywritten</p>
<p>they will sue</p>
<p>you if it is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible monsanto has actually people that</p>
<p>go around and test crops of people that they suspect</p>
<p>are using a</p>
<p>generation away from</p>
<p>their last seed</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>scary i mean and you know how</p>
<p>crazy is that now can you take</p>
<p>those seeds and like make new</p>
<p>new versions of that seed no it</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be any</p>
<p>trace of it no</p>
<p>no is there</p>
<p>even genetically modified</p>
<p>so they know what the genome</p>
<p>of this particular</p>
<p>plant that they&rsquo;ve created is</p>
<p>right so if you have that shit in your field</p>
<p>you have to pay them every year</p>
<p>every year you have</p>
<p>to pay for new seeds you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>the way people always did it</p>
<p>you grew tomatoes you took the seeds from the tomatoes</p>
<p>you grew more tomatoes</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do that now it&rsquo;s illegal</p>
<p>like that is</p>
<p>the nuttiest</p>
<p>shit ever and that&rsquo;s the number one reason for</p>
<p>genetically modifying food is to control the</p>
<p>market and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the number one</p>
<p>reason also why marijuana will always remain illegal</p>
<p>to a lot of people</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll want to keep</p>
<p>it illegal rather is because they can&rsquo;t control it no</p>
<p>you know hemp has</p>
<p>grown in every industrialized country</p>
<p>other than america it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>how crazy is that canada</p>
<p>right up north</p>
<p>right above us</p>
<p>right they&rsquo;re growing it</p>
<p>they grow all of the seed products that are in</p>
<p>whole foods and all that</p>
<p>nutrition so all this is</p>
<p>money that farmers</p>
<p>could be making here all this</p>
<p>shit all this shit they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stealing from them</p>
<p>these cunts</p>
<p>yep the government is</p>
<p>stealing from</p>
<p>steal julius i love</p>
<p>and stealing it by</p>
<p>denying them</p>
<p>their own country</p>
<p>everywhere fucking best country it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna indiana grow</p>
<p>nascar american</p>
<p>peace i know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m free they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>bomb california</p>
<p>is what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do what are they</p>
<p>gonna do max</p>
<p>that proposition</p>
<p>9 takes over 19</p>
<p>19 proposition 19</p>
<p>i was thinking gay</p>
<p>the one when they when that shit</p>
<p>goes into effect if and when</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna change the culture</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the big change is gonna be in people&rsquo;s behavior</p>
<p>because you can talk all the paper you want but</p>
<p>the most fascinating</p>
<p>thing to me</p>
<p>is what it does</p>
<p>to people socially it changes the fuck out of</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>well you know some of the</p>
<p>things that people are coming out</p>
<p>against property</p>
<p>19 is saying is that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to lend itself to corporations and it&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>corporations are not saying that who&rsquo;s saying that</p>
<p>believe it or not we have a lot of people</p>
<p>that are in the medical</p>
<p>marijuana industry that don&rsquo;t want to see prop19</p>
<p>pass because they&rsquo;re comfortable</p>
<p>right now in</p>
<p>their profiteering</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t want to see</p>
<p>a status quo</p>
<p>change and it&rsquo;s really sad because</p>
<p>these are the people that have benefit the most when</p>
<p>their local communities</p>
<p>allow them to</p>
<p>start selling</p>
<p>to anybody over 21 without a doctor&rsquo;s note</p>
<p>right but the doctors who&rsquo;ve been making</p>
<p>their living for all</p>
<p>these years giving away prescriptions</p>
<p>and charging</p>
<p>150 bucks a pop</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that source of income</p>
<p>these guys have</p>
<p>doctors were historically</p>
<p>wealthy and they&rsquo;ll do fine actually practicing</p>
<p>medicine i&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>maybe but when you&rsquo;re set up for years and years and</p>
<p>years just giving out medical marijuana prescriptions</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re comfortable with it then all of a</p>
<p>sudden something&rsquo;s gonna come</p>
<p>along to make your business go away</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna have to come up with some</p>
<p>whole new business</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>selfish douchebag i</p>
<p>could see where you&rsquo;d be like man i don&rsquo;t want this</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that why the alcohol</p>
<p>beverage industry is giving to the campaign against us</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that why all</p>
<p>these interested</p>
<p>self interested companies are</p>
<p>stepping up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all the</p>
<p>same thing but</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t expect</p>
<p>it out of the medical marijuana doc</p>
<p>another lie i</p>
<p>heard was that big tobacco monies behind this when it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>such bullshit proposition</p>
<p>19 yes when you can look up and</p>
<p>see where all the</p>
<p>money came from</p>
<p>going forever</p>
<p>it realistically though</p>
<p>prop 19 was passed by somebody that as somebody i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>known for over 15 years he&rsquo;s a really good person</p>
<p>that really just wanted to do the right</p>
<p>thing he wanted to put forward a more</p>
<p>liberal initiative</p>
<p>but he had cash and he pulled</p>
<p>the initiative</p>
<p>and he found that more liberal</p>
<p>initiatives</p>
<p>were not pulling well enough to actually pass</p>
<p>so he actually</p>
<p>pulled back pulled back pulled back on the verbiage</p>
<p>until he got an</p>
<p>initiative that pulled well enough to pass</p>
<p>and what a lot of people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t realize is that this is not the means to the end</p>
<p>this is just</p>
<p>or this is a means to the end it&rsquo;s not the end</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just one</p>
<p>small step in the</p>
<p>evolution of</p>
<p>getting our freedoms back and this prop 19 is</p>
<p>going to be</p>
<p>one step closer to having our</p>
<p>rights back</p>
<p>and what a lot of people are talking</p>
<p>about which is pissing me off is that</p>
<p>we got meg whitman buying her way into the governorship</p>
<p>and we have</p>
<p>steve cooley who has been the guy down here in la for</p>
<p>those of you</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t live in la</p>
<p>who has been</p>
<p>closing down all the los angeles bought clubs</p>
<p>and if this guy gets the top</p>
<p>cop position in the</p>
<p>state of california</p>
<p>and prop nineteen loses</p>
<p>all of these</p>
<p>idiots and i&rsquo;ll say you are</p>
<p>idiots that are</p>
<p>going against prop</p>
<p>nineteen that are selling medical marijuana</p>
<p>are gonna lose your businesses and lose your freedoms</p>
<p>and the only</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna protect you right now</p>
<p>is if everybody in the</p>
<p>state gets the</p>
<p>rights that you have been getting for the last</p>
<p>14 years since medical marijuana</p>
<p>concentrate on</p>
<p>these dildos let&rsquo;s concentrate</p>
<p>on that yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>concentrate</p>
<p>on that cop not the</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>steve cooley</p>
<p>is this is the guy that&rsquo;s running for attorney general</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s basically running as somebody that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>against the</p>
<p>death penalty and in</p>
<p>california you</p>
<p>might as well be running</p>
<p>against somebody unopposed</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s running</p>
<p>against someone who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>against the</p>
<p>death penalty yes oh so he&rsquo;s running unopposed</p>
<p>in that sense he is</p>
<p>absolutely and when he gets in his agenda</p>
<p>is to do in the</p>
<p>state that he</p>
<p>has already done in la</p>
<p>well why is he want to shut down medical pot</p>
<p>stores ideologically on</p>
<p>who knows who knows what he&rsquo;s invested in</p>
<p>who knows what his reality is from</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all part</p>
<p>of his life you know</p>
<p>who knows who</p>
<p>who really he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>loyal to in that</p>
<p>sense you know</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>campaign contributions or something there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>going on i would love to be able to</p>
<p>follow the money forensically and see exactly</p>
<p>what changed</p>
<p>these people because</p>
<p>in some ways there&rsquo;s got to be strengths pulling them</p>
<p>you know and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>cheap to run a campaign in the</p>
<p>state of california you need</p>
<p>to get on the sides of people with a lot of</p>
<p>money well that&rsquo;s where they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a lot</p>
<p>of collective</p>
<p>money oh megan</p>
<p>she is very</p>
<p>very rich and what is she what was her position in ebay</p>
<p>she had something to do with ebay</p>
<p>she i thought</p>
<p>founded not</p>
<p>founded she was the one that</p>
<p>was brought in and like brought them from being a very</p>
<p>small company to a very</p>
<p>large company she helped</p>
<p>organize them and she rode</p>
<p>their growth curve</p>
<p>okay so she made a ton of</p>
<p>money off ebay</p>
<p>and now she wants to be the governor and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>spending how much</p>
<p>money to do this she&rsquo;s already</p>
<p>spent over a hundred million dollars of her own</p>
<p>money to become governor</p>
<p>yeah 100 million</p>
<p>for a job that</p>
<p>pays 200 000 a year google it people how much does</p>
<p>it pay how much does it pay</p>
<p>it pays nothing and this is a scarier</p>
<p>port it&rsquo;s like what do you</p>
<p>think she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna accomplish</p>
<p>with this 100</p>
<p>million influence</p>
<p>what is she doing this for</p>
<p>test them out to their ego</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>building a big you know why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do it too</p>
<p>and you know this is just</p>
<p>turn my volume down no</p>
<p>this is the part that kind of bothers</p>
<p>me is that this is more of what we&rsquo;ve had for a long</p>
<p>time it&rsquo;s just that now we&rsquo;re looking at it and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>grossed out by it</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t think before newspapers and internet</p>
<p>carried the word</p>
<p>that robber barons</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t running politics</p>
<p>going back to the 30s and 40s and 50s</p>
<p>and when i say they i don&rsquo;t mean to</p>
<p>sound like some conspiracy</p>
<p>not i mean to</p>
<p>sound like somebody that&rsquo;s realistic</p>
<p>about the fact that alcohol</p>
<p>got together</p>
<p>after prohibition and went yo who&rsquo;s our competition</p>
<p>all these kids are smoking this loco we gotta</p>
<p>set and then</p>
<p>we should go</p>
<p>after that but look at it this way okay this</p>
<p>makes okay okay</p>
<p>this meg woman</p>
<p>woman she is obviously very wealthy</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s going to be very difficult</p>
<p>to buy a person that&rsquo;s very wealthy she&rsquo;s very wealthy</p>
<p>so why would this</p>
<p>very wealthy person want to stop medical marijuana in</p>
<p>california because that is what she wants to do</p>
<p>what would be her</p>
<p>motivation because it</p>
<p>would not be financial</p>
<p>right she doesn&rsquo;t need the</p>
<p>money she&rsquo;s paying 100 million dollars</p>
<p>can i say the governor you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that alcohol companies</p>
<p>for sure are not giving her a hundred million dollars</p>
<p>when you have that much</p>
<p>money joe it isn&rsquo;t sitting</p>
<p>in a locker at the edge of your bed it&rsquo;s sitting</p>
<p>in investments and i&rsquo;d love to know what her portfolios</p>
<p>vested in because she has people that are actually</p>
<p>standing there saying</p>
<p>this is what i&rsquo;ll advise you to do</p>
<p>and anybody that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>advising somebody that has</p>
<p>literally hundreds of millions of dollars</p>
<p>is going to say listen</p>
<p>this initiative</p>
<p>is bad for your liquor investments it&rsquo;s bad for your</p>
<p>pharmaceutical investments it&rsquo;s bad for you so you</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s purely</p>
<p>a financial decision on her i</p>
<p>think a lot of why we&rsquo;re dealing with prohibition</p>
<p>and why we&rsquo;re dealing with people that are</p>
<p>against it is because of the financial</p>
<p>connections they have in the more wealthy they are</p>
<p>the more people lean</p>
<p>against them</p>
<p>how few in a</p>
<p>sense do we have of you</p>
<p>because here you are a guy that made it in tv</p>
<p>five years of newsradio five plus years on fear factor</p>
<p>you have a career you have</p>
<p>advisors around you saying listen joe if you do</p>
<p>stupid stuff</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna not get you the big jobs it&rsquo;ll pay a lot of</p>
<p>money and then i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna make money</p>
<p>so are those persons</p>
<p>gonna advise you to go be the</p>
<p>activist that you&rsquo;ve become</p>
<p>or are they</p>
<p>gonna say bro</p>
<p>really because i know that a lot of</p>
<p>other actors have to stop and think man</p>
<p>i won&rsquo;t get hired</p>
<p>if if i start getting all radical</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what they really believe</p>
<p>so they told the line</p>
<p>you are so rare cause you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t told the line</p>
<p>he said fuck it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d rather be</p>
<p>happy and be myself than be some</p>
<p>slave to a corporate you know dictation</p>
<p>yeah well you don&rsquo;t have to do it that way</p>
<p>those guys are pussies</p>
<p>a lot of emons</p>
<p>but when i look at it</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re a nice person</p>
<p>but how few</p>
<p>woody harrelson&rsquo;s and joe rogan&rsquo;s do we have</p>
<p>speaking up for the</p>
<p>right reasons</p>
<p>well you know what a lot of people</p>
<p>have families and they want to play it safe and they</p>
<p>feel conservative and they get paranoid and they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>trust in the</p>
<p>greater good of</p>
<p>humanity and the</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s ability to see</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>faith in their ability to express themselves</p>
<p>so that people</p>
<p>understand the</p>
<p>point of view that they have and</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re coming from</p>
<p>right i have</p>
<p>confidence is my ability to express myself</p>
<p>and you do it for us all i think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important for everybody i</p>
<p>think everybody</p>
<p>should and would do it if you&rsquo;re a rational</p>
<p>thinking person why</p>
<p>would you live your life pretending to be something</p>
<p>other than who you are</p>
<p>you know why</p>
<p>would you not want people to know</p>
<p>about something that&rsquo;s radically</p>
<p>changed the way you look at the</p>
<p>world why would you not want to</p>
<p>why because</p>
<p>fucking meg whitman says it&rsquo;s bad look at that bitch</p>
<p>get the fuck out of here did she quit or get</p>
<p>fired from ebay i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a woman who wants to be in control of</p>
<p>things that&rsquo;s always freaky she</p>
<p>probably don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need a mom is in ebay</p>
<p>seventy five percent of ebay&rsquo;s audience</p>
<p>stone people in the middle of</p>
<p>night buying shit she</p>
<p>should know her audience</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>she probably</p>
<p>pulled a sarah</p>
<p>payment i got</p>
<p>fired you know she&rsquo;s slapped away</p>
<p>for more lucrative</p>
<p>investments</p>
<p>man women that want to run</p>
<p>should creep me out</p>
<p>no i know it</p>
<p>sounds gross</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s totally true</p>
<p>why because hillary clinton</p>
<p>she doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>creep you out</p>
<p>she is a creeps me the fuck out right</p>
<p>condoleezza</p>
<p>rice have condoleezza</p>
<p>rice was running</p>
<p>things on you</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>freak the fuck out</p>
<p>creepy but there&rsquo;s a lot of creepy guys</p>
<p>dictating you</p>
<p>right they&rsquo;re creepy</p>
<p>too i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>saying i want guys running shit</p>
<p>but at least they&rsquo;ve been doing that forever</p>
<p>when a chick wants to</p>
<p>hop in there and compete with the man i&rsquo;m like what you</p>
<p>crazy bitch</p>
<p>what are you doing you&rsquo;re not balanced you ain&rsquo;t</p>
<p>no fucking yogi</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna see through the maze</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re fucking just as</p>
<p>crazy as the</p>
<p>men if not crazier because you have to because you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>woman and because they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>prove that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tougher than the men that i was</p>
<p>terrified that scares me</p>
<p>there was a moment</p>
<p>where hillary</p>
<p>clinton was running for president when i was</p>
<p>thinking you know what</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s gonna win</p>
<p>and what if she wins</p>
<p>and she gets a new position</p>
<p>where one of these</p>
<p>crazy fucks from another country tests her</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>woman i mean if</p>
<p>assuming that political</p>
<p>power is real and then the president really has any</p>
<p>say and then anybody in another country really does pay</p>
<p>attention to him that it&rsquo;s not all this big gigantic</p>
<p>build a burger meeting group</p>
<p>assuming that a president is real</p>
<p>could you imagine what putin</p>
<p>would do if he sat across</p>
<p>from fucking hillary clinton or sour palin at</p>
<p>some sort of negotiations it&rsquo;s horrible</p>
<p>would crush them isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>a mock them he would</p>
<p>well because most</p>
<p>cultures put</p>
<p>their most intellectually capable people in</p>
<p>power and not</p>
<p>their you know</p>
<p>best idiots</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s not that men</p>
<p>should be running shit</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s not because i</p>
<p>think most capable i</p>
<p>think the idea of the</p>
<p>alpha the one the idea of having a leader is fucking</p>
<p>ridiculous i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>archaic shit that we have to figure a new way around</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m not saying that men</p>
<p>should be running shit</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m saying that</p>
<p>anybody who&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>woman that wants to run shit</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>crazy like you don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>have a dick why are you trying to control everything</p>
<p>what are you doing why are you trying to fucking</p>
<p>grab the reins i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what are you doing</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to be president okay i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not i don&rsquo;t want to be a leader</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get me wrong</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying that i am better than a woman who</p>
<p>would be doing the job i&rsquo;m saying when i see a</p>
<p>woman who wants to be a leader i</p>
<p>understand the man wanting to be a leader it makes</p>
<p>sense to me even if i don&rsquo;t believe in it or</p>
<p>agree with it i</p>
<p>understand it</p>
<p>when i see a</p>
<p>woman that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wanna do it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like look at that</p>
<p>crazy bitch</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i</p>
<p>think i think you</p>
<p>wanna be the king of the</p>
<p>world and you&rsquo;re a chick</p>
<p>whoa you know</p>
<p>but yet iced</p>
<p>lin&rsquo;s not in wars and they had a female</p>
<p>friend over there</p>
<p>i was i was</p>
<p>starting to</p>
<p>think of all the female leaders around</p>
<p>the world i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot actually it&rsquo;s totally sex a lot of</p>
<p>queen because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s totally</p>
<p>sexist don&rsquo;t get me</p>
<p>wrong but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think anybody</p>
<p>should be a leader</p>
<p>i think the</p>
<p>whole idea is i like</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s based on some leftover</p>
<p>fucking shit from back when we were a</p>
<p>tribe of 200</p>
<p>monkey people</p>
<p>and we needed a leader to protect us from the other</p>
<p>monkey people who wanted to rape our</p>
<p>women and take our food</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s what it is</p>
<p>the idea that one person can represent the</p>
<p>whole country like</p>
<p>a president i don&rsquo;t give a fuck if he has a cabinet</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t give a</p>
<p>the idea that there&rsquo;s a one guy that</p>
<p>stands there</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen the president of the united states</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s even the</p>
<p>voice even the figurehead even</p>
<p>descendant of</p>
<p>royalty it sure</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an avatar</p>
<p>you did the</p>
<p>whole idea is</p>
<p>ridiculous it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so they</p>
<p>created our whole</p>
<p>structure in america to compete</p>
<p>against what they were</p>
<p>what they were</p>
<p>fighting and then they</p>
<p>became that and work and they became way worse</p>
<p>right way worse</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s beautiful</p>
<p>i love this</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna hear so much shit from my female friends well</p>
<p>thank you you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think women</p>
<p>should be running things</p>
<p>oh what does that mean</p>
<p>i think men do it better</p>
<p>maybe maybe men have been doing it</p>
<p>wrong for so long</p>
<p>maybe be good for a</p>
<p>woman to give it a try</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re definitely comfortable</p>
<p>in your relationship</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a worldly</p>
<p>thing to say if she&rsquo;s a woman</p>
<p>meaning like i</p>
<p>you know i mean i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna be like yeah fuck</p>
<p>women should be presidents</p>
<p>you know right now i&rsquo;m like what was his name</p>
<p>to be president what are you talking about</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s saying he&rsquo;s afraid to get his</p>
<p>dick cut off</p>
<p>when he goes home and he&rsquo;s obviously saying you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>no but what he&rsquo;s saying is you misread</p>
<p>the thing is he&rsquo;s trying</p>
<p>to pretend to be someone in different so he&rsquo;s attracted</p>
<p>to females i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna start</p>
<p>bashing the female race race</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it is</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not bashing the females</p>
<p>rate listen most women</p>
<p>females that&rsquo;s how women</p>
<p>say that listen</p>
<p>well the women that take that are cunts and</p>
<p>listen i&rsquo;m not bashing the female races</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not bashing the male race it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want to be president</p>
<p>you know most of the male race</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want to be president</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to be president it&rsquo;s not a male</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s a leader thing</p>
<p>but what i&rsquo;m saying is i</p>
<p>understand the creepy fuck control</p>
<p>freak men i</p>
<p>understand that instinct</p>
<p>but when i see a</p>
<p>chick that wants to rock that right</p>
<p>i go what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on there</p>
<p>you see like</p>
<p>sarah palin</p>
<p>i guess one way</p>
<p>sarah palin is just this</p>
<p>dummy that got</p>
<p>stuck into a</p>
<p>nice position and she&rsquo;s trying to make some money</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>what it is but</p>
<p>after a while it&rsquo;s not that anymore after a</p>
<p>while it&rsquo;s like well you&rsquo;re the figurehead for the</p>
<p>retard movement and you&rsquo;re just like them and you got a</p>
<p>microphone on you</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a spotlight</p>
<p>on you and oh now you&rsquo;re a fucking problem because you</p>
<p>never were supposed to get to this point</p>
<p>and somehow you&rsquo;ve artificially</p>
<p>been inserted into the public consciousness</p>
<p>with no merit</p>
<p>and now all the retards go</p>
<p>just like me woo</p>
<p>i hope they rise up and</p>
<p>start these fucking tea</p>
<p>party rallies</p>
<p>have you watched any of that shit they&rsquo;re crazy</p>
<p>god damn insane and</p>
<p>glennback is just making gold</p>
<p>underwear and gold socks and</p>
<p>and diamond</p>
<p>covered fucking cars and that guy must be just</p>
<p>scraping it in with rakes</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s so obviously full of shit too</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like his game only works on the dumb</p>
<p>it only but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so many dumb people it&rsquo;s a very effective tactic</p>
<p>him and her together man they</p>
<p>scare the fuck out of it double dumb double</p>
<p>glenn back and</p>
<p>sarah palin</p>
<p>they combined</p>
<p>forces like they did at</p>
<p>their party meeting</p>
<p>dude they could they</p>
<p>could run for president</p>
<p>man that&rsquo;s real shit i hope the</p>
<p>first president&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>black lady with a lisp</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s totally a lesbian</p>
<p>i hope it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>every single horrible</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with you know like you know banning gay</p>
<p>marriage you know</p>
<p>women presents i hope it&rsquo;s all combined into one like</p>
<p>super president</p>
<p>that just pisses off everybody</p>
<p>i hope it&rsquo;s an alien</p>
<p>an alien i hope an</p>
<p>alien wins in disguise of a</p>
<p>human being and then tells everybody</p>
<p>now that we have a</p>
<p>diplomat we&rsquo;d like to</p>
<p>now that i&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>place and i&rsquo;m running shit</p>
<p>bitches need to sit the fuck down</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been thinking about</p>
<p>exterminating you fucks for</p>
<p>about 50 years now</p>
<p>i thought your concept</p>
<p>about getting</p>
<p>mold was really accurate</p>
<p>well it is a</p>
<p>giant life form</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a giant life form on a</p>
<p>superorganism</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what the</p>
<p>human race is</p>
<p>the human race</p>
<p>on earth earth is a life form it is a</p>
<p>superorganism we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think of planets that support life as a life form</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s an environment</p>
<p>where life grows</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m not so sure</p>
<p>about that if you look at lava</p>
<p>in the center in the magnetic core and you look at the</p>
<p>magnetosphere in the</p>
<p>atmosphere and like this is like it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>a place where life is it&rsquo;s almost like a</p>
<p>system it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>alive and we might</p>
<p>be conscious</p>
<p>yeah we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s conscious man we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>guessing and we assume that conscious means</p>
<p>that it can talk like</p>
<p>us and move like us but we don&rsquo;t know we don&rsquo;t there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of evidence that there</p>
<p>might be something</p>
<p>going on inside trees some sort of a fucking</p>
<p>reaction that trees and</p>
<p>plants have to people</p>
<p>well think of cellular intelligence</p>
<p>yeah and that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;ve always thought oh it&rsquo;s in our</p>
<p>brain and then</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this myth that we don&rsquo;t even use our own</p>
<p>brain all of our</p>
<p>brain and it&rsquo;s like really</p>
<p>do you know how many of us</p>
<p>are you stupid that you believe that your</p>
<p>whole body is not actually</p>
<p>shooting at all</p>
<p>all marks right now and i</p>
<p>think that our</p>
<p>capability of intelligence is really really deep well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a metaphor i think for</p>
<p>wasted potential</p>
<p>people have this</p>
<p>idea we&rsquo;re only</p>
<p>using 10 of our</p>
<p>brains if we just really concentrate</p>
<p>no one even</p>
<p>knows what that means what does that mean you&rsquo;re only</p>
<p>using ten percent of your</p>
<p>brain what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on with the</p>
<p>other ninety percent of</p>
<p>your brain like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s useful well you know how</p>
<p>we know how the</p>
<p>brain works</p>
<p>when we blow holes and parts of the</p>
<p>brain we shoot people and parts their head</p>
<p>and then we go i can&rsquo;t see anymore i</p>
<p>guess that&rsquo;s the part</p>
<p>where you see out of</p>
<p>it is oh we</p>
<p>drilled a hole here and he</p>
<p>still saw he&rsquo;s calm</p>
<p>well i guess this is the part that makes him</p>
<p>aggressive we&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>drill a hole in that</p>
<p>bitch that was</p>
<p>the lobotomy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>they did when people got a little nutty they go</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>wanna do you</p>
<p>wanna kill him</p>
<p>you wanna drill a fucking hole in his head and</p>
<p>see if we can fix him one flew over the cuckoo&rsquo;s nest</p>
<p>that went too</p>
<p>far yeah they</p>
<p>would fix people by</p>
<p>drilling holes in</p>
<p>their head hollow back</p>
<p>hollow back y&rsquo;all</p>
<p>you know you ever there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whole group of</p>
<p>humans that voluntarily put holes in their head</p>
<p>and they believe that it</p>
<p>alleviates pressure and gives them euphoria</p>
<p>and that the pressure of the growing</p>
<p>brain trapped inside the</p>
<p>skull causes headaches and all sorts of problems</p>
<p>and in africa there&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>cultures that have done this</p>
<p>where they literally they caught the entire</p>
<p>skull i posted it on twitter</p>
<p>see if you can find it i mean i don&rsquo;t know what you</p>
<p>would look under</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a term</p>
<p>for it there&rsquo;s a term for it for</p>
<p>streaming holes</p>
<p>in someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>head where they call</p>
<p>shit i&rsquo;m fucking up here</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s an actual term for it</p>
<p>but people do it on purpose it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>see if you can find that but</p>
<p>people look</p>
<p>great voluntary wholes</p>
<p>in panning yes</p>
<p>trae panning</p>
<p>trepa and ing its</p>
<p>often reusable</p>
<p>leave pressure beneath a surface</p>
<p>bubble yeah and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a video of</p>
<p>these african dudes</p>
<p>where they do it with no anesthesia and they do it with</p>
<p>these fucking</p>
<p>stone tools</p>
<p>they like strip away your fucking</p>
<p>scalp and cut out your bone</p>
<p>oh they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just do it once they do it as many as 20 times</p>
<p>they had a life</p>
<p>yeah and they fucked</p>
<p>their brains up because</p>
<p>not only that</p>
<p>they have to wear</p>
<p>they have to wear hats from</p>
<p>then on i&rsquo;m sure because</p>
<p>their brain is exposed there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a canoe shaped cut out</p>
<p>on the top of</p>
<p>their fucking</p>
<p>skull dr john</p>
<p>clark was the</p>
<p>first one to do it in 1664</p>
<p>and he taught the africans how to do it that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re saying us i&rsquo;m sorry us</p>
<p>us american</p>
<p>hmm well no he</p>
<p>might have it</p>
<p>might have been just</p>
<p>like religion we brought christianity over to africa</p>
<p>it just says</p>
<p>first fit position</p>
<p>to perform it in the us</p>
<p>and he did it as a alleviating pressure on someone yeah</p>
<p>whoa it&rsquo;s like if you can think</p>
<p>about it someone&rsquo;s out there doing it man</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>those women in</p>
<p>surrey is that</p>
<p>where is in africa</p>
<p>where they cut</p>
<p>their lip and</p>
<p>stick a plate in it</p>
<p>have you seen that shit you know i&rsquo;m talking you</p>
<p>never seen the</p>
<p>plates in the</p>
<p>lower lips yeah yeah yeah i didn&rsquo;t know the theory</p>
<p>dude named it&rsquo;s the most</p>
<p>insane thing it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>weird the bigger the plate</p>
<p>the more cows they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>worth when they get married</p>
<p>so like say if you want to</p>
<p>marry my daughter</p>
<p>okay and she&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>giant ass fucking</p>
<p>plate i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>bitch that&rsquo;s a 50 cow plate</p>
<p>you gotta come strong son</p>
<p>right so dudes</p>
<p>would have to give up</p>
<p>me heard they have to give up a herd because she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>willing to carry around this</p>
<p>giant plate in her lips</p>
<p>what else issue they bang their</p>
<p>teeth out too</p>
<p>they have to bang</p>
<p>their lower</p>
<p>teeth out because the</p>
<p>plate sits there and</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get a full</p>
<p>plate in there if you have the</p>
<p>lower teeth</p>
<p>so when the</p>
<p>plate starts getting big they have to</p>
<p>smash their</p>
<p>teeth out yeah</p>
<p>my blowjobs feel like</p>
<p>probably how much</p>
<p>does africa</p>
<p>suck oh my god</p>
<p>willing to do that</p>
<p>you willing to put</p>
<p>plates in your lips and cut holes</p>
<p>in your head thing</p>
<p>where they stretch</p>
<p>the neck out</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking crazy</p>
<p>they must be so</p>
<p>freaked out they got</p>
<p>stuck in africa they&rsquo;re like look we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna make this</p>
<p>interesting all right</p>
<p>pretty much</p>
<p>stuck running from</p>
<p>hyenas and getting</p>
<p>eaten by crocodiles and shit we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to</p>
<p>stretch our necks out make our necks real big wow</p>
<p>who knows why they do</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>well how about</p>
<p>those heads they</p>
<p>found in peru</p>
<p>where they stretch</p>
<p>their head out gigantic like a big alien head</p>
<p>they did it to like a huge percentage of the</p>
<p>population they put</p>
<p>boards in their heads and</p>
<p>and tied them down and</p>
<p>literally extended their head</p>
<p>and people were</p>
<p>thinking well is this</p>
<p>to emulate something is it to emulate the gods all the</p>
<p>anunnaki people see</p>
<p>this is evidence they were doing this to try to emulate</p>
<p>maybe not because look at</p>
<p>these africans are cutting the fucking holes in</p>
<p>their lip and</p>
<p>sticking plates in there are the dudes</p>
<p>cutting the holes in</p>
<p>their heads and</p>
<p>letting the air out you know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not emulating anything</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just practicing</p>
<p>medicine they&rsquo;re fucking nuts man people are nuts</p>
<p>well they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still kind of nuts too or they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trolling everyone you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>freaky the disease i had as a</p>
<p>child i found out in the mid 80s they stopped</p>
<p>treating aggressively</p>
<p>that like more when i was in the 70s i was more</p>
<p>victim of fucking chemotherapy</p>
<p>and elective</p>
<p>surgeries or not elective</p>
<p>surgeries but</p>
<p>surgeries that</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t needed</p>
<p>and radiation than i</p>
<p>was of the actual disease because they were practicing</p>
<p>what yeah you</p>
<p>know what&rsquo;s fucked up too is the x in histocytosis x</p>
<p>meant that the ethology of the disease was unknown</p>
<p>and when i first</p>
<p>asked an adult</p>
<p>where did my disease come from and they went</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know and i was like wait a</p>
<p>minute who&rsquo;s we</p>
<p>you and me or like</p>
<p>we like so what</p>
<p>exactly is the disease</p>
<p>histo what it&rsquo;s like an overactive immune system</p>
<p>histosite it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>histocytosis x</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an overactive immune</p>
<p>system disease</p>
<p>right like i</p>
<p>would have too many</p>
<p>white blood cells</p>
<p>and they would</p>
<p>in a sense accumulate if you will</p>
<p>and usually it was in</p>
<p>bone marrow in</p>
<p>areas like that and it creates like blowout so like my</p>
<p>spine it blew out my arm it blew out</p>
<p>my hip it blew out</p>
<p>would it get better if you got sick</p>
<p>what do you mean sick you got a cold</p>
<p>now cause you&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>hotels are there</p>
<p>right no no no think no</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>usually ever get</p>
<p>sneeze it all the time but</p>
<p>funny is i don&rsquo;t really ever get sick</p>
<p>either i either i have problems</p>
<p>where like obviously</p>
<p>it was overgrowing</p>
<p>you know in</p>
<p>marrows and</p>
<p>stuff or i&rsquo;m always</p>
<p>healthy i went to prison five years i didn&rsquo;t get a cold</p>
<p>whoa yeah and that&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>in place let me tell you</p>
<p>but start licking toilets how</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>touching doors and shit</p>
<p>though i&rsquo;m not a germaphobe but i actually i&rsquo;m careful</p>
<p>people are gross</p>
<p>yeah people</p>
<p>are nose picking balls scratching ass</p>
<p>fucking wiping</p>
<p>just disgusting fucking</p>
<p>which is why i always recommend you use a tissue</p>
<p>from the bathroom when you open the door to</p>
<p>any public restroom i take mine open</p>
<p>not if you gotta pull it</p>
<p>play with a man</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>twist it and pull it</p>
<p>usually you</p>
<p>do actually</p>
<p>you use a piece</p>
<p>of towel yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s ways</p>
<p>you can protect yourself and if we had hemp we</p>
<p>could be using hemp towel man</p>
<p>you just have to</p>
<p>clean it man dude we had</p>
<p>some hemp flashlights</p>
<p>which is why we have to vote yes on 19</p>
<p>yeah vote yes on 19 it&rsquo;s very important and</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re one of</p>
<p>those people out there that goes man</p>
<p>potheads are fucking annoying</p>
<p>unfortunately</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of potheads are annoying</p>
<p>you know most potheads lots</p>
<p>just like most people</p>
<p>yeah like most people</p>
<p>a good percentage of people are annoying</p>
<p>and the reason being is because we do not have</p>
<p>a direction book on how to properly live a healthy life</p>
<p>a healthy fun</p>
<p>satisfying life</p>
<p>you know we live our lives</p>
<p>based on myths and bullshit</p>
<p>tv shows and movies and</p>
<p>we have this distorted perception of what this fucking</p>
<p>world is all about so</p>
<p>most people with this</p>
<p>especially with</p>
<p>the situation that we have now the way our</p>
<p>world is set up it&rsquo;s so easy for a</p>
<p>moron just drift through and be</p>
<p>taken care of</p>
<p>every step of the way</p>
<p>and yet have opinions and yet be able to vote</p>
<p>george bush junior</p>
<p>well sarah palin</p>
<p>man that&rsquo;s way</p>
<p>scary than her</p>
<p>than him gary</p>
<p>cool at least he was a man</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s right i said it</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t give</p>
<p>a fuck gary</p>
<p>coleman gary coleman</p>
<p>can vote yeah</p>
<p>angry as fuck</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d been angry too</p>
<p>after his whole bad life</p>
<p>yeah not the saddest part of his life i</p>
<p>would not have been</p>
<p>angry when he</p>
<p>was in the hospital dead</p>
<p>dying in his fucking</p>
<p>crazy cunt ex wife takes a picture</p>
<p>and sells it to</p>
<p>matt over him like all strapped up with pipes and shit</p>
<p>dying in bed and she&rsquo;s</p>

<p>have any emotion in her eyes nothing like yep here</p>
<p>he is he&rsquo;s dead and this is me i&rsquo;m next to the dead guy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s horrible</p>
<p>oh it&rsquo;s gross because that shit on like mouse pads</p>
<p>pretty sure</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never seen that i did not</p>
<p>know she did that yeah that&rsquo;s pretty dope i&rsquo;m learning</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m learning</p>
<p>well you got it</p>
<p>saved even huh i</p>
<p>think i should oh</p>
<p>usually i do</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t thank you</p>
<p>enough for coming out and support a prop 19 man well</p>
<p>dude you know i</p>
<p>enjoy the marijuana</p>
<p>so of course i&rsquo;ve got to support prop 19</p>
<p>you know a lot of people have been really confused</p>
<p>on what this really does man and you know that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>a big problem for us because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what i was talking</p>
<p>about what i&rsquo;m saying most people</p>
<p>you look at potheads and you</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>annoying right</p>
<p>really i&rsquo;m finding them</p>
<p>annoying right now because i can&rsquo;t believe all</p>
<p>these people i was working around that we thought</p>
<p>was working towards a common goal and now working</p>
<p>against it because a lot of people are</p>
<p>against prop 19</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>a lot of people are</p>
<p>against prop</p>
<p>19 not for the</p>
<p>right reasons either</p>
<p>for financial reasons</p>
<p>financial reasons or</p>
<p>just inaccuracies</p>
<p>how much most hippies are though</p>
<p>every time i</p>
<p>was hanging out with hippies they were trying to make</p>
<p>money making profits and still</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of non hippies that are just commercially</p>
<p>motivated there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of people that</p>
<p>have just got in this industry in the last few years</p>
<p>you know sp</p>
<p>at 420 past and allowed for clubs</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to make money</p>
<p>and right now they</p>
<p>think oh no you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna change</p>
<p>this and we like this so please don&rsquo;t change this</p>
<p>and that is really</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re up</p>
<p>against you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right when it comes from</p>
<p>the enemy within if you will</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of people that aren&rsquo;t hippies they&rsquo;re opportunists</p>
<p>they are i know a</p>
<p>bunch of people that are in the business</p>
<p>yeah the people that own like</p>
<p>dispensaries they&rsquo;re doing it purely for profit some</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of good ones yeah you</p>
<p>know berkeley</p>
<p>patients good</p>
<p>harborside they&rsquo;re all good there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>good one provide</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s good marijuana is good</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of people that you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t expect they&rsquo;re not like</p>
<p>old dudes with gray hair and ponytails yeah</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re young dudes look like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right fucking doing squats right now</p>
<p>problem nineteen is</p>
<p>gonna make it so</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t having to get away with it it&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be able to service</p>
<p>their neighbors who have a</p>
<p>right to have pot</p>
<p>and everybody in the</p>
<p>state&rsquo;s gonna have a</p>
<p>right to grow pot and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be a big</p>
<p>big yeah so all</p>
<p>these people that are selling it the shit&rsquo;s gonna go</p>
<p>under because no one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna need to buy it you</p>
<p>can just grow your own</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s gonna see the</p>
<p>prices drop</p>
<p>thankfully you know</p>
<p>radically radically</p>
<p>and profits are</p>
<p>gonna drop and</p>
<p>right now you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the liquor companies it&rsquo;s the big drug cartels</p>
<p>these are the people that are getting i&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>more than willing to pay</p>
<p>exactly what i&rsquo;m paying</p>
<p>right now just keep making it just as good i&rsquo;ll pay</p>
<p>just as much</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not growing a shit</p>
<p>no there&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>gonna be thousand dollar bottles of wine</p>
<p>you know and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be people that do</p>
<p>things with a high quality and grandma</p>
<p>could grow better pot than</p>
<p>me for instance and you&rsquo;ll want grandma&rsquo;s pot over mine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really bulk</p>
<p>like cheetos</p>
<p>i wanted to see like but see piles of it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>throwing joints out my</p>
<p>window the only</p>
<p>thing about</p>
<p>crazy is that</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really lend itself for quality with quantity</p>
<p>because when you have</p>
<p>large amounts of it</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>in a sense is is good quality control</p>
<p>right now in</p>
<p>smaller batches</p>
<p>now let&rsquo;s talk</p>
<p>about one thing</p>
<p>for the non smoking</p>
<p>non marijuana smoking amongst us this is one of the</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>really fascinated me the most when i</p>
<p>first found out</p>
<p>about marijuana</p>
<p>when i first</p>
<p>when i first</p>
<p>when i was a</p>
<p>kid i thought marijuana was bad for you it made you</p>
<p>stupid all these different things</p>
<p>but when i first</p>
<p>started smoking weed</p>
<p>the thing that fascinated me the most</p>
<p>was that there are two</p>
<p>completely different strains</p>
<p>that have very different</p>
<p>effects just</p>
<p>not different</p>
<p>strains okay let me</p>
<p>break this down</p>
<p>can i say this right now</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of confusion</p>
<p>in this before i went to prison a friend of mine he</p>
<p>wrote marijuana</p>
<p>botany and he</p>
<p>later wrote the book hashish been revised</p>
<p>his name&rsquo;s robert</p>
<p>colonel clark</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s forgotten more</p>
<p>about cannabis than i&rsquo;ve had an opportunity to learn</p>
<p>and while i was in prison</p>
<p>these scientists actually looked at the</p>
<p>specimens of sativa and indica</p>
<p>and sativa and</p>
<p>indica were questions</p>
<p>so if i walked up to you with seeds joe</p>
<p>it would actually be</p>
<p>does this make</p>
<p>clothing and</p>
<p>paper and all this</p>
<p>stuff or is it like</p>
<p>india because</p>
<p>if you look up the word</p>
<p>indica names</p>
<p>indica means</p>
<p>of or like india</p>
<p>okay so when you go to</p>
<p>india all of the cannabis that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>grown there is indica</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s in india</p>
<p>but when you</p>
<p>go there you&rsquo;ll find tropical varieties down by goa</p>
<p>and northern varieties</p>
<p>up by the area that&rsquo;s now pakistan and hindu kush</p>
<p>that is the entire</p>
<p>range of cannabis and it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>indica the history lesson is interesting but</p>
<p>for everyone today</p>
<p>who wants pot there&rsquo;s two different effects</p>
<p>indica makes you sleepy</p>
<p>and it makes you</p>
<p>couch weed it</p>
<p>makes you what a lot of people</p>
<p>think of as a</p>
<p>stoner sativa</p>
<p>is a totally different</p>
<p>experience and it makes you much more</p>
<p>introspective it makes you</p>
<p>start looking at fucking telescopes and</p>
<p>space documentaries so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>strain what</p>
<p>should we call it</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>equatorial variety it&rsquo;s from near the equator</p>
<p>cause let me</p>
<p>break this down</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two different</p>
<p>effects though correct</p>
<p>this is what i want people</p>
<p>who are not potsmokers to</p>
<p>understand this</p>
<p>when they go into</p>
<p>these deep historical</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not but</p>
<p>but they did</p>
<p>it like this</p>
<p>right in the 60s and 70s all the pot that was</p>
<p>coming into america was like acapulco gold michuican</p>
<p>maui wai jamaican</p>
<p>all of these</p>
<p>strains were from</p>
<p>the equator tropical</p>
<p>they made you</p>
<p>happy horny well organized</p>
<p>want to do things like protest</p>
<p>and then the hippies went to afghanistan</p>
<p>they found this</p>
<p>short fat leaves</p>
<p>plant that they thought was</p>
<p>indica and they</p>
<p>started mixing it with all</p>
<p>these tropical varieties like maui waui and thai</p>
<p>stick and stuff</p>
<p>and they shortened</p>
<p>the time it</p>
<p>takes to flower cannabis and they picked varieties</p>
<p>that yielded</p>
<p>the most amount of pot because it was the reason being</p>
<p>is that the ones that were equatorial the</p>
<p>ones that were growing on the equator needed a longer</p>
<p>cycle of sun because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in a 12 12 and</p>
<p>those are the</p>
<p>ones that have the different psychoactive effect</p>
<p>ones that come in contact more with the sun</p>
<p>are the ones that make</p>
<p>you not so much more with the sun</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the</p>
<p>varieties that developed near around the equator</p>
<p>where there was a longer</p>
<p>cycle our more innocence</p>
<p>cycle and in a</p>
<p>sense to be</p>
<p>grown in america they have to be</p>
<p>grown indoors yep</p>
<p>and then what happened is the hippies in a</p>
<p>sense started</p>
<p>breeding this afghan with all of</p>
<p>their tropical varieties</p>
<p>and through the 80s we kind of</p>
<p>developed this one hit wonder pot</p>
<p>that took away</p>
<p>all that good energy and took away all that</p>
<p>and now for me i always</p>
<p>smoke haze i like</p>
<p>super silver haze and nl</p>
<p>for people who don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand what you&rsquo;re saying haze means sativa</p>
<p>in a sense it does in the</p>
<p>sense our terminology of sativa but sativa really means</p>
<p>most useful</p>
<p>but the way okay that&rsquo;s true but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not how it&rsquo;s used</p>
<p>dispensaries</p>
<p>dispensaries</p>
<p>indica and sativa</p>
<p>is how it&rsquo;s used sativa is the heady</p>
<p>more you know trippy</p>
<p>spaceweed and</p>
<p>indica is couch high energy</p>
<p>this is my whole</p>
<p>point in the beginning was</p>
<p>i did not know there was two different types</p>
<p>of pot i thought pot was pot and then all pot had a</p>
<p>similar effect some pot may be</p>
<p>stronger than</p>
<p>other pot but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically all pot you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>smoke pot you&rsquo;ll either get really high or what</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the same</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even remotely the same there are two different</p>
<p>experiences</p>
<p>and almost everyone is used to</p>
<p>indica because</p>
<p>indica is the easiest shit to grow</p>
<p>and because the shit</p>
<p>that you know you&rsquo;re getting if you&rsquo;re getting it from</p>
<p>you know some dudes are</p>
<p>coming down from you know they&rsquo;re in canada growing in</p>
<p>those commercials</p>
<p>brickweed it</p>
<p>grows the fastest and yields</p>
<p>the most and</p>
<p>now that we&rsquo;re getting through prohibition we&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>these varieties</p>
<p>that take longer and</p>
<p>yield less but</p>
<p>have a profoundly different</p>
<p>effect on our energy</p>
<p>and our thinking</p>
<p>and our movement exactly so how is it</p>
<p>wrong what i was saying</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s not sativa everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>calling it sativa but sativa really means hemp</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s indo european hemp variety</p>
<p>right but we&rsquo;ve decided</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t names though</p>
<p>but everyone universally</p>
<p>in the pot community they&rsquo;re looking at two different</p>
<p>things indica and sativa that&rsquo;s what they called it</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s universally in the pot community</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all just a</p>
<p>noise you make with your</p>
<p>mouth to describe something</p>
<p>absolutely okay but</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be making different</p>
<p>things we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna call it to</p>
<p>tv and look at</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s we want</p>
<p>to fuck out of</p>
<p>people that&rsquo;s what it is</p>
<p>right now we look we</p>
<p>look what am i</p>
<p>gonna call it reality</p>
<p>california&rsquo;s not that</p>
<p>developed hive weed</p>
<p>and couchweed what do we call</p>
<p>it we&rsquo;ll call it names like you know</p>
<p>arrowhead or you</p>
<p>know avion or whatever we&rsquo;re calling that</p>
<p>water at the time we don&rsquo;t really go</p>
<p>give me a bottle of</p>
<p>water when we&rsquo;re sitting in a five star</p>
<p>no i say bottled</p>
<p>water what am i a fucking</p>
<p>water connoisseur</p>
<p>and now i just want</p>
<p>water okay now trip on this the same way</p>
<p>right now you walk up to a weed</p>
<p>counter it&rsquo;s almost like the same</p>
<p>thing because</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t make distinguishes</p>
<p>like you do liquor</p>
<p>and when you walk up to</p>
<p>a bar you know the difference between wine and whiskey</p>
<p>and if somebody you ought a</p>
<p>whiskey and they hand you wine you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be like yo douchebag this isn&rsquo;t what i asked for</p>
<p>right but when i go to the now</p>
<p>store i say hey</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s your sativas</p>
<p>oh we got jack</p>
<p>cleaner we got</p>
<p>trainwreck or give me some of that</p>
<p>trainwreck and then</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>we do but technically all drug varieties are</p>
<p>indica what</p>
<p>no there&rsquo;s two different</p>
<p>types though when you go to indica</p>
<p>when you go to</p>
<p>india and you get</p>
<p>indica and it&rsquo;s from go</p>
<p>india india</p>
<p>suck my dick</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two different</p>
<p>experiences we&rsquo;ve broken</p>
<p>this down for</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t know look</p>
<p>practical knowledge this is very important</p>
<p>what all he&rsquo;s saying is all nonsense</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two different</p>
<p>experiences</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>couchweed and there&rsquo;s the weed that makes you</p>
<p>think about the universe and want to be creative</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s sativa</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they call it the indigo</p>
<p>shit is og kush</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna take a nap and eat cheetos all day that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what they say</p>
<p>oh gee grows very much like a sativa</p>
<p>just so you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s long and leggy and grows tall and has</p>
<p>small buds and</p>
<p>right i hate</p>
<p>to break that feeling</p>
<p>different it&rsquo;s a more potent</p>
<p>version of it but you want</p>
<p>to know what&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>my hays my sativa</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re calling it came back at</p>
<p>237 thc and my og cush</p>
<p>indicate call it</p>
<p>came back at 206</p>
<p>there was a 31</p>
<p>difference in</p>
<p>stage right</p>
<p>but aren&rsquo;t there a</p>
<p>bunch of different</p>
<p>things cannabinoids</p>
<p>other than thc that make up the high it&rsquo;s not just thc</p>
<p>well actually i think that</p>
<p>there was a doctorate</p>
<p>by the way we should</p>
<p>point out that todd knows a shit</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s your book</p>
<p>before we go any</p>
<p>further like who&rsquo;s this guy</p>
<p>talking all this</p>
<p>shit about weed</p>
<p>well there was a doctor</p>
<p>at the infant faggot</p>
<p>what does he know this is what he knows bitch</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a book</p>
<p>how to grow a medical marijuana</p>
<p>out of europe</p>
<p>oh i&rsquo;m right here no no</p>
<p>i came back it&rsquo;s on a delay</p>
<p>this is a book</p>
<p>how to grow medical marijuana and it&rsquo;s not in</p>
<p>print right now</p>
<p>right no to get it you go to amazon com</p>
<p>and maybe get a used copy</p>
<p>yes probably do that right yeah</p>
<p>my next book grow</p>
<p>medicine is</p>
<p>gonna come out and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna be talking about</p>
<p>strain specific growing</p>
<p>yeah you can</p>
<p>write a lot</p>
<p>of books on growing weed it&rsquo;s very complex isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>it is and there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>differences when people try to say oh</p>
<p>generalizes how you grow pot you can tell they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never grown pot</p>
<p>because pot is very different to grow</p>
<p>go ahead i was gonna say</p>
<p>this is a question i need answered because i do not</p>
<p>understand it now</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a female</p>
<p>plant and a male plant and</p>
<p>you need the female</p>
<p>plant is where the</p>
<p>medicine comes from</p>
<p>where weed comes from</p>
<p>right there so you</p>
<p>need a male</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in both</p>
<p>right but they become</p>
<p>one or the other like you have to get the males out</p>
<p>explain what happens like how it pollinates</p>
<p>males are sex</p>
<p>much like men in an irony you&rsquo;ll find</p>
<p>funny is that normal with other</p>
<p>plants by the way</p>
<p>some plants are either</p>
<p>diatious or have both sexes on one</p>
<p>plant cannabis</p>
<p>actually can be both</p>
<p>cause it does some</p>
<p>aphrodite and</p>
<p>sometimes spews on itself so you get a male you</p>
<p>gotta get it out of there</p>
<p>right males actually</p>
<p>create their pollen</p>
<p>sacs faster than the females actually develop</p>
<p>their buds and in hemp for instance the males</p>
<p>pollinate and then die off</p>
<p>early and the</p>
<p>roman catholic</p>
<p>church miscategorized the male and female</p>
<p>plants even though the female had the seeds</p>
<p>and even though the male blew the pollen</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t like that the male died off early</p>
<p>so they called</p>
<p>the male the female and the female the male</p>
<p>whoa yeah they were</p>
<p>heavy they were</p>
<p>heavy into their dogma</p>
<p>you know can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>rattle their cage</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the way</p>
<p>cannabis works so how do you tell so if you grow</p>
<p>say if you&rsquo;re growing a</p>
<p>bunch of wheat plants</p>
<p>you have to keep an eye on them</p>
<p>bitches because if they all they&rsquo;re all males just like</p>
<p>certain leaves it&rsquo;s like a little tiny</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>leaves what they do is they develop</p>
<p>these little they develop</p>
<p>these little male</p>
<p>pollen sacs if you will</p>
<p>and what they do is they come</p>
<p>off the flower different they come off the plant and</p>
<p>they hang like little ball sacks</p>
<p>and they open up and</p>
<p>then the pollen</p>
<p>this is a male flower open</p>
<p>the pollen is</p>
<p>carried to the</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve ever seen little red hairs on your pot</p>
<p>those are the sex glands</p>
<p>and they are what they don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>you higher at all</p>
<p>what the red the yeah the red hair</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get you higher at all well the red hair</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have crystals on</p>
<p>right you know they just have</p>
<p>these like non</p>
<p>glamulous stuff it</p>
<p>looks cool though so you get some weed and you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>red hair red hair scum</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s not what you want yeah and it&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s so pretty and well when that male pollen</p>
<p>hits those pistols what it does is it</p>
<p>causes that</p>
<p>to fertilize and the seed grows in that little</p>
<p>pod and if she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>fertilized that</p>
<p>pod just gets</p>
<p>swells and swells and swells</p>
<p>and the resin develops deeper</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why we grow seedless cannabis because it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>tricking the female</p>
<p>into like really producing a lot of resins and a lot of</p>
<p>you know just she&rsquo;s waiting waiting waiting to be</p>
<p>fertilized it</p>
<p>never comes so it makes it more potent</p>
<p>well you know potency i</p>
<p>think is an interesting</p>
<p>conversation there was a doctored institute of</p>
<p>medicine who</p>
<p>got up one day and he said i gave my patients 10</p>
<p>milligrams thc</p>
<p>and they had a</p>
<p>known effect and then i gave him 10</p>
<p>milligrams thc and one</p>
<p>milligram cbn and it</p>
<p>doubled the effective dose</p>
<p>and i shot my hand up and i said hey</p>
<p>would that replicate in nature and he said i</p>
<p>think it would</p>
<p>and when i put my hand down</p>
<p>my publisher said what did you two geeks just ask each</p>
<p>other and i said</p>
<p>basically he told me to</p>
<p>breed hemp in with my drug varieties</p>
<p>because cbn for instance is a chemical that&rsquo;s mostly</p>
<p>found in hemp</p>
<p>and as we have bred away from the characteristics of</p>
<p>these equatorial varieties that are more hemp like</p>
<p>we have actually bred more towards the drug varieties</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve lowered the chemical</p>
<p>of cbn down</p>
<p>while raising thc up</p>
<p>with less of an effective rate</p>
<p>so now we have thc</p>
<p>levels over 20</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t hit us as hot as i believe</p>
<p>is if we had a little bit of cbn</p>
<p>mixed in with it</p>
<p>how many different</p>
<p>cannabinoids are there inside a marijuana plant</p>
<p>well there are over 400</p>
<p>chemicals created by the cannabis</p>
<p>plant and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>definition of a cannabinoid</p>
<p>and the reality is is that 60 of them</p>
<p>known to be</p>
<p>therapeutic</p>
<p>you shits vibrate it&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll ignore it</p>
<p>coming through the</p>
<p>microphone and what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen is</p>
<p>that as science</p>
<p>understands</p>
<p>these elements of it more</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;ll be able to better</p>
<p>direct what the different chemicals and also</p>
<p>terpenes because</p>
<p>terpenes are</p>
<p>these volatile oils that are on the bud</p>
<p>and what happens is they&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>steamed off when it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dried so if anybody&rsquo;s ever picked up</p>
<p>cannabis flour</p>
<p>and it had good body and you squished it and had sled</p>
<p>moisture and you could</p>
<p>smell it was real</p>
<p>strong those</p>
<p>terpenes were intact</p>
<p>and that is a psychoactive effect</p>
<p>very much and</p>
<p>a synogistic psychoactive</p>
<p>effect so it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>good it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>over drying it bad joey</p>
<p>has like to take his weed</p>
<p>and put it on the heater</p>
<p>i put that shit on the heater</p>
<p>you know i do</p>
<p>i put that shit on the windowsill</p>
<p>and let it dry out</p>
<p>yeah perfect i put it sometimes i put on top of the tv</p>
<p>but the reality is is</p>
<p>because a lot of what he&rsquo;s getting is people that are</p>
<p>hurrying to</p>
<p>market and they sell pot that&rsquo;s not dry and not cured</p>
<p>the the best cannabis is actually not just</p>
<p>dried but cured</p>
<p>and then stored for</p>
<p>about three</p>
<p>months and then</p>
<p>the oil set up and they&rsquo;re the smoothest</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a window of when</p>
<p>those cannabinoids actually keep themselves</p>
<p>which is between</p>
<p>three months and nine</p>
<p>months so after</p>
<p>that after nine</p>
<p>months you weed</p>
<p>starts to degrade chemically decompose</p>
<p>in a sense yes so old weeds</p>
<p>whack whatever what</p>
<p>about if you cook different how</p>
<p>about different</p>
<p>what if you cook with it</p>
<p>would feel like an old</p>
<p>chocolate bar</p>
<p>an old wheat chocolate</p>
<p>bar how long does that last if you have an old</p>
<p>wheat chocolate bar</p>
<p>older than nine</p>
<p>months and the</p>
<p>dairy product in it</p>
<p>would be moldy and you</p>
<p>would have other issues with chocolate</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>wrapped up chocolate they&rsquo;re wrapped up</p>
<p>well not the kind that it depends on</p>
<p>me probably</p>
<p>ain&rsquo;t no dane</p>
<p>i have some of those</p>
<p>old fucking nestle&rsquo;s</p>
<p>quick bars that they made with weed</p>
<p>uh you know a lot of why</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t eat cannabis that&rsquo;s provided to me by people is</p>
<p>cause i don&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>conditions in</p>
<p>which it&rsquo;s made and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>trust their</p>
<p>you know the way they handled it and</p>
<p>stuff and on</p>
<p>yet not just measuring cuz you don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>strong it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>interestingly enough you know in holland</p>
<p>like hash bond bonds and</p>
<p>brownies are considered a hard drug</p>
<p>totally verboten</p>
<p>yeah you can be 16 and go into a</p>
<p>dutch coffee shop by hash on your way to high</p>
<p>school and you cool</p>
<p>and this you can&rsquo;t buy</p>
<p>brownies that you told me</p>
<p>about first you&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>first person to tell me</p>
<p>about 11 hydroxy</p>
<p>that eating weed</p>
<p>eating weed when you eat weed it goes through your</p>
<p>liver and kidneys and actually turns a</p>
<p>chemical process and it turns the psychoactive chemical</p>
<p>thc into another chemical called 11 hydroxy metabol8</p>
<p>and that 11 hydroxy is too</p>
<p>to five times more psychoactive</p>
<p>than the canvas actually it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>three to five times was the</p>
<p>estimate i saw out of the</p>
<p>university of</p>
<p>mississippi</p>
<p>yeah i know</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>thcv i mean</p>
<p>11 hydroxy in your</p>
<p>bloodstream when you</p>
<p>smoke cannabis</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a different</p>
<p>experience and you and i were talking</p>
<p>about it one</p>
<p>night i don&rsquo;t remember what the</p>
<p>context of the conversation was but it was probably i</p>
<p>ate something that was just too fucking strong</p>
<p>and you had to explain it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so many people have had it and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m on acid or something it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>it does not feel like pot</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not used to it because when you</p>
<p>smoke pot you&rsquo;re only used to dealing with thc and</p>
<p>bloodstream and not tea</p>
<p>and not 11 hydrox so</p>
<p>different man</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing ari shafir</p>
<p>we were on a</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re on a plane the</p>
<p>other day we were flying to austin</p>
<p>texas and ari</p>
<p>ate a cookie in his car on the way to the airport</p>
<p>and then he got there and you</p>
<p>know it takes an hour and 20 minutes or so to kick in</p>
<p>he got there we were on the</p>
<p>plane on the tarmac and he was seriously thinking</p>
<p>about telling him that they had to let him off the</p>
<p>plane cause he&rsquo;s that high</p>
<p>was that high</p>
<p>oh i didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>until we landed</p>
<p>some model did that the</p>
<p>other day i saw him really</p>
<p>well you know</p>
<p>dave chappelle did that too dave chappelle had a</p>
<p>panic moment on a</p>
<p>plane i gotta get off it</p>
<p>might have been that you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those things that you wonder if you really</p>
<p>want to go with it though what if you get off the</p>
<p>plane the fog and then</p>
<p>crash as you both</p>

<p>draft the declaration of independence was drafted</p>
<p>on him yeah</p>

<p>using before the invention of some of</p>
<p>these things</p>
