    <p>The following is a conversation with Simon Sinek,</p>
<p>author of several books, including Start With Why,</p>
<p>Leaders Eat Last, and his latest, The Infinite Game.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the best communicators</p>
<p>of what it takes to be a good leader,</p>
<p>to inspire, and to build businesses</p>
<p>that solve big, difficult challenges.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>

<p>review it with five stars on Apple Podcast,</p>
<p>support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter,</p>
<p>at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;ll do one or two minutes of ads now,</p>
<p>and never any ads in the middle</p>
<p>that can break the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope that works for you,</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t hurt the listening experience.</p>
<p>Quick summary of the ads.</p>
<p>Two sponsors, Cash App and Masterclass.</p>
<p>Please consider supporting the podcast</p>
<p>by downloading Cash App and using code LexPodcast,</p>
<p>and signing up to Masterclass at Masterclass.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App,</p>
<p>the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>When you get it, use code LexPodcast.</p>
<p>Cash App lets you send money to friends,</p>
<p>buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market</p>
<p>with as little as one dollar.</p>
<p>Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin,</p>
<p>let me mention that cryptocurrency,</p>
<p>in the context of the history of money, is fascinating.</p>
<p>I recommend Ascent of Money as a great book on this history.</p>
<p>Debits and credits on Ledger started around 30,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The US dollar created over 200 years ago,</p>
<p>and Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency,</p>
<p>released just over 10 years ago.</p>
<p>So given that history, cryptocurrency&rsquo;s still very much</p>
<p>in its early days of development,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still aiming to, and just might,</p>
<p>redefine the nature of money.</p>
<p>So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store</p>
<p>or Google Play, and use the code LexPodcast,</p>
<p>you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 the first,</p>
<p>an organization that is helping to advance robotics</p>
<p>and STEM education for young people around the world.</p>

<p>When I first heard about Masterclass,</p>
<p>I honestly thought it was too good to be true.</p>
<p>For $180 a year, you get an all access pass</p>
<p>to watch courses from experts at the top of their field.</p>
<p>To list some of my favorites,</p>
<p>Chris Hatfield on Space Exploration,</p>
<p>Neil deGrasse Tyson on Scientific Thinking</p>
<p>and Communication, Will Wright, the creator of SimCity,</p>
<p>and Sims on Game Design.</p>
<p>I love that game.</p>
<p>Jane Goodall on Conservation, Carlos Santana,</p>
<p>one of my favorite guitarists on guitar,</p>
<p>Gary Kasparov on Chess, obviously I&rsquo;m Russian,</p>
<p>I love Gary, Daniel Negrano on Poker,</p>
<p>one of my favorite poker players,</p>
<p>also Phil Ivey gives a course as well,</p>
<p>and many, many more.</p>
<p>Chris Hatfield explaining how rockets work</p>
<p>and the experience of being launched into space alone</p>
<p>is worth the money.</p>
<p>By way of advice, for me, the key is not to be overwhelmed</p>
<p>by the abundance of choice.</p>
<p>Pick three courses you want to complete,</p>
<p>watch each all the way through from start to finish,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that long, but it&rsquo;s an experience</p>
<p>that will stick with you for a long time, I promise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easily worth the money,</p>
<p>you can watch it on basically any device.</p>
<p>Once again, sign up at masterclass.com slash Lex</p>
<p>to get a discount and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Simon Sinek.</p>
<p>In the Infinite Game, your most recent book,</p>
<p>you describe the finite game and the infinite game,</p>
<p>so from my perspective of artificial intelligence</p>
<p>and game theory in general, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of finite games</p>
<p>from the broad philosophical sense,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something that in the robotics,</p>
<p>artificial intelligence space, we know how to deal with,</p>
<p>and then you describe the infinite game,</p>
<p>which has no exact static rules,</p>
<p>has no well defined static objective,</p>
<p>the players are known, unknown, they change,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the dynamic element,</p>
<p>so this is something that applies to business, politics,</p>
<p>life itself, so can you try to articulate</p>
<p>the objective function here of the infinite game,</p>
<p>or in the cliche, broad philosophical sense,</p>
<p>what is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Go for the, start with a softball.</p>
<p>Yep, easy question first.</p>
<p>So James Kars was the philosopher</p>
<p>who originally articulated this concept</p>
<p>of finite and infinite games,</p>
<p>and when I learned about it,</p>
<p>it really challenged my view of how the world works, right?</p>
<p>Because I think we all think about winning</p>
<p>and being the best and being number one,</p>
<p>but if you think about it,</p>
<p>only in a finite game can that exist,</p>
<p>a game that has fixed rules, agreed upon objectives,</p>
<p>and known players, like football or baseball,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always a beginning, middle, and end,</p>
<p>and if there&rsquo;s a winner, there has to be a loser.</p>
<p>Infinite games, as Kars describes them,</p>
<p>as you said, have known and unknown players,</p>
<p>which means anyone can join,</p>
<p>it has changeable rules,</p>
<p>which means you can play however you want,</p>
<p>and the objective is to perpetuate the game,</p>
<p>to stay in the game as long as possible.</p>
<p>In other words, there&rsquo;s no such thing</p>
<p>as being number one or winning</p>
<p>in a game that has no finish line.</p>
<p>And what I learned is that when we try to win</p>
<p>in a game that has no finish line,</p>
<p>we try to be number, we try to be the best</p>
<p>in a game that has no agreed upon objectives</p>
<p>or agreed upon metrics or timeframes,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a few consistent and predictable outcomes,</p>
<p>the decline of trust, the decline of cooperation,</p>
<p>the decline of innovation.</p>
<p>And I find this fascinating because so many of the ways</p>
<p>that we run most organizations is with a finite mindset.</p>
<p>So trying to reduce the beautiful complex thing</p>
<p>that is life or whatever, politics or business,</p>
<p>into something very narrow,</p>
<p>and in that process, the reductionist process,</p>
<p>you lose something fundamental</p>
<p>that makes the whole thing work in the long term.</p>
<p>So returning, not gonna let you off the hook easy,</p>
<p>what is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>So what is the objective function</p>
<p>that is worthwhile to pursue?</p>
<p>Well, if you think about our tombstones, right?</p>
<p>They have the date we were born and the date we died,</p>
<p>but really it&rsquo;s what we do with the gap in between.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a poem called The Dash.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s the dash that matters.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what we do between the time we&rsquo;re born</p>
<p>and the time we die that gives our life meaning.</p>
<p>And if we live our lives with a finite mindset,</p>
<p>which means to accumulate more power or money</p>
<p>than anybody else, to outdo everyone else,</p>
<p>to be number one, to be the best,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t take any of us with us.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t take any of it with us.</p>
<p>We just die.</p>
<p>The people who get remembered the way we wanna be remembered</p>
<p>is what kind of people we were, right?</p>
<p>Devoted mother, loving father,</p>
<p>what kind of person we were to other people.</p>
<p>Jack Welch just died recently,</p>
<p>and the Washington Post,</p>
<p>when it wrote the headline for his obit,</p>
<p>it wrote, he pleased Wall Street and distressed employees.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s his legacy.</p>
<p>A finite player who is obsessed with winning,</p>
<p>who leaves behind a legacy of short term gains for a few</p>
<p>and distress for many.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his legacy.</p>
<p>And every single one of us gets the choice</p>
<p>of the kind of legacy we wanna have.</p>
<p>Do we wanna be remembered for our contributions</p>
<p>or our detractions?</p>
<p>To live with a finite mindset,</p>
<p>to live a career with a finite mindset,</p>
<p>to be number one, be the best, be the most famous,</p>
<p>you live a life like Jack Welch, you know?</p>
<p>To live a life of service, to see those around us rise,</p>
<p>to contribute to our communities, to our organizations,</p>
<p>to leave them in better shape than we found them,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the kind of legacy most of us would like to have.</p>
<p>So day to day, when you think about</p>
<p>what is the fundamental goals, dreams,</p>
<p>motivations of an infinite game,</p>
<p>of seeing your life, your career as an infinite game,</p>
<p>what does that look like?</p>
<p>I mean, I guess I&rsquo;m sort of trying to stick</p>
<p>on this personal ego, personal drive,</p>
<p>the thing that the fire, the reason we wanna wake up</p>
<p>in the morning and the reason we can&rsquo;t go to bed</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re so excited, what is that?</p>
<p>So for me, it&rsquo;s about having a just cause.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about a vision that&rsquo;s bigger than me,</p>
<p>that my work gets to contribute</p>
<p>to something larger than myself, you know?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what drives me every day.</p>
<p>I wake up every morning with a vision of a world</p>
<p>that does not yet exist, a world in which the vast majority</p>
<p>of people wake up every single morning inspired,</p>
<p>feel safe at work and return home fulfilled</p>
<p>at the end of the day.</p>
<p>It is not the world we live in.</p>
<p>And so that we still have work to do</p>
<p>is the thing that drives me.</p>
<p>You know, I know what my underlying values are.</p>
<p>You know, I wake up to inspire people</p>
<p>to do the things that inspire them.</p>
<p>And these are the things that, these are the things that I,</p>
<p>these are my go tos, my touch points</p>
<p>that inspire me to keep working.</p>
<p>You know, I think of a career like an iceberg.</p>
<p>You know, if you have a vision for something,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the only one who can see the iceberg</p>
<p>underneath the ocean.</p>
<p>But if you start working at it, a little bit shows up.</p>
<p>And now a few other people can see what you imagine,</p>
<p>be like, oh, right, yeah, no,</p>
<p>I wanna help build that as well.</p>
<p>And if you have a lot of success,</p>
<p>then you have a lot of iceberg</p>
<p>and people can see this huge iceberg</p>
<p>and they say, you&rsquo;ve accomplished so much.</p>
<p>But what I see is all the work still yet to be done.</p>
<p>You know, I still see the huge iceberg underneath the ocean.</p>
<p>And so the growth, you talk about momentum.</p>
<p>So the incremental revealing of the iceberg</p>
<p>is what drives you.</p>
<p>Well, it necessarily is incremental.</p>
<p>What drives me is that, is the realization,</p>
<p>is realizing the iceberg, bringing more of the iceberg</p>
<p>from the unknown to the known,</p>
<p>bringing more of the vision from the imagination to reality.</p>
<p>And you have this fundamental vision of optimism.</p>
<p>You call yourself an optimist.</p>
<p>I mean, in this world, I have a sort of,</p>
<p>I see myself a little bit as the main character</p>
<p>from The Idiot by Dostoevsky,</p>
<p>who is also kind of seen by society as a fool</p>
<p>because he was optimistic.</p>
<p>So one, can you maybe articulate</p>
<p>where that sense of optimism comes from?</p>
<p>And maybe also try to articulate your vision of the future</p>
<p>where people are inspired, where optimism drives us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to forget that when you look at social media</p>
<p>and so on, where the word toxicity and negativity</p>
<p>can often get more likes,</p>
<p>that optimism has a sort of a beauty to it.</p>
<p>And I do hope it&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>So can you try to articulate that vision?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I mean, for me, optimism and being an optimist</p>
<p>is just seeing the silver lining in every cloud.</p>
<p>Even in tragedy, it brings people together.</p>
<p>And the question is, can we see that?</p>
<p>Can you see the beauty that is in everything?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think optimism is foolishness.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think optimism is blindness,</p>
<p>though it probably involves some naivete,</p>
<p>the belief that things will get better,</p>
<p>the belief that we tend towards the good,</p>
<p>even in times of struggle or bad.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t sustain war, but you can sustain peace.</p>
<p>I think things that are stable are more sustainable,</p>
<p>things that are optimistic are more sustainable</p>
<p>than things that are chaotic.</p>
<p>So you see people as fundamentally good.</p>
<p>I mean, some people may disagree</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t sustain peace, you can&rsquo;t sustain war.</p>
<p>I mean, I think war is costly.</p>
<p>It involves life and money,</p>
<p>and peace does not involve those things.</p>
<p>It requires work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it doesn&rsquo;t require work,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t drain resources,</p>
<p>I think the same way that war does.</p>
<p>The people that would say that we will always have war,</p>
<p>and I just talked to the historian of Stalin,</p>
<p>would say that conflict and the desire for power</p>
<p>and conflict is central to human nature.</p>
<p>I concur.</p>
<p>But something in your words also,</p>
<p>perhaps it&rsquo;s the naive aspect that I also share,</p>
<p>is that you have an optimism</p>
<p>that people are fundamentally good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an idealist, and I think idealism is good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a fool to believe that the ideals</p>
<p>that I imagine can come true.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;ll never be world peace,</p>
<p>but shouldn&rsquo;t we die trying?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the whole point.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole point of vision.</p>
<p>Vision should be idealistic,</p>
<p>and it should be, for all practical purposes, impossible.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we shouldn&rsquo;t try,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the milestones that we reach</p>
<p>that take us closer to that ideal</p>
<p>that make us feel that our life and our work have meaning,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re contributing to something bigger than ourselves.</p>
<p>You know, just because it&rsquo;s impossible</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean we shouldn&rsquo;t try.</p>
<p>As I said, we&rsquo;re still moving the ball down the field.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still making progress.</p>
<p>Things are still getting better,</p>
<p>even if we never get to that ideal state.</p>
<p>So I think idealism is a good thing.</p>
<p>You know, in the word infinite game,</p>
<p>one of the beautiful and tragic aspects of life,</p>
<p>human life at least, at least from the biological</p>
<p>perspective, is that it ends.</p>
<p>So sadly, it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>To some people, yeah.</p>
<p>Fine, it&rsquo;s tragic to some people, or is it ends, it ends?</p>
<p>I think some people believe that it ends on the day you die,</p>
<p>and some people think it continues on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, and there&rsquo;s a lot of different ways</p>
<p>to think what continues on even looks like.</p>
<p>But let me drag it back to the personal.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Which is, how do you think about your own mortality?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>How do you think about your own death?</p>
<p>I definitely haven&rsquo;t accomplished everything</p>
<p>I want to contribute to.</p>
<p>I would like more time on this earth</p>
<p>to keep working towards that vision.</p>
<p>Do you think about the fact that it ends for you?</p>
<p>Are you cognizant of it?</p>
<p>Of course I&rsquo;m cognizant of it.</p>
<p>I mean, aren&rsquo;t we all?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t dwell on it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware of it.</p>
<p>I know that my life is finite,</p>
<p>and I know that I have a certain amount of time left</p>
<p>on this planet, and I&rsquo;d like to make that time be valuable.</p>
<p>You know, some people would think that ideas</p>
<p>kind of allow you to have a certain kind of immortality.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe to linger on this kind of question.</p>
<p>So first to push back on the,</p>
<p>you said that everyone&rsquo;s cognizant of their mortality.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy named Ernest Becker who would disagree,</p>
<p>that you basically say that most of human cognition</p>
<p>is created by us trying to create an illusion</p>
<p>and try to hide the fact from ourselves,</p>
<p>the fact that we&rsquo;re gonna die,</p>
<p>to try to think that it&rsquo;s all gonna go on forever.</p>
<p>But the fact that we know that it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yes, but this mix of denial.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the book&rsquo;s called Denial of Death.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this constant denial that we&rsquo;re running away from.</p>
<p>In fact, some would argue that the inspiration,</p>
<p>the incredible ideas you&rsquo;ve put out there,</p>
<p>your TED Talk has been seen by millions</p>
<p>and millions of people, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just you trying to desperately fight the fact</p>
<p>that you are biologically mortal.</p>
<p>Your creative genius comes from the fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to create ideas</p>
<p>that live on long past you.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s very nice of you.</p>
<p>I mean, I would like my ideas to live on beyond me</p>
<p>because I think that is a good test</p>
<p>that those ideas have value in the lives of others.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a good test.</p>
<p>That others would continue to talk about</p>
<p>or share the ideas long after I&rsquo;m gone,</p>
<p>I think is perhaps the greatest compliment</p>
<p>one can get for one&rsquo;s own work.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s my awareness of my mortality</p>
<p>that drives me to do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my desire to contribute that drives me to do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the optimist vision.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the pleasure and the fulfillment you get</p>
<p>from inspiring others.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as pure as that.</p>
<p>Let me ask, listen, I&rsquo;m rushing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get you to get you into these dark areas.</p>
<p>Is the ego tied up into it somehow?</p>
<p>So your name is extremely well known.</p>
<p>If your name wasn&rsquo;t attached to it,</p>
<p>do you think you would act differently?</p>
<p>I mean, for years, I hated that my name was attached to it.</p>
<p>I had a rule for years that I wouldn&rsquo;t have my face</p>
<p>on the front page of the website.</p>
<p>I had a fight with the publisher</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t want my name big on the book.</p>
<p>I wanted it tiny on the book.</p>
<p>Because I kept telling them it&rsquo;s not about me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about the ideas.</p>
<p>They wanted to put my name on the top of my book, I refused.</p>
<p>None of my books have my names on the top</p>
<p>because I won&rsquo;t let them.</p>
<p>They would like very much to put my name</p>
<p>on the top of the book,</p>
<p>but the idea has to be bigger than me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not bigger than the idea.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautifully put.</p>
<p>Do you think ego?</p>
<p>But I also am aware that I&rsquo;ve become recognized</p>
<p>as the messenger.</p>
<p>And even though I still think the message is bigger than me,</p>
<p>I recognize that I have a responsibility as the messenger.</p>
<p>And whether I like it or not is irrelevant.</p>
<p>I accept the responsibility, I&rsquo;m happy to do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how to phrase this,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a large part of the culture right now</p>
<p>that emphasizes all the things that nobody disagrees with,</p>
<p>which is health, sleep, diet, relaxation,</p>
<p>meditation, vacation, are really important.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t really argue against that.</p>
<p>In fact, people.</p>
<p>Less sleep.</p>
<p>Less.</p>
<p>Just, I&rsquo;m joking.</p>
<p>Yes, well, that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>I often speak to the fact that passion</p>
<p>and love for what you&rsquo;re doing and the two words hard work,</p>
<p>especially in the engineering fields,</p>
<p>are more important than,</p>
<p>are more important to prioritize than sleep.</p>
<p>Even though sleep is really important,</p>
<p>your mind should be obsessed with the hard work,</p>
<p>with the passion, and so on.</p>
<p>And then I get some pushback, of course, from people.</p>
<p>What do you make sense of that?</p>
<p>Is that just me, the crazy Russian engineer,</p>
<p>really pushing hard work?</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s a short term strategy.</p>
<p>I think if you sacrifice your health for the work,</p>
<p>at some point, it catches up with you.</p>
<p>And at some point, it&rsquo;s like going, going, going,</p>
<p>and you get sick.</p>
<p>Your body will shut down for you</p>
<p>if you refuse to take care of yourself.</p>
<p>You get sick.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what happens.</p>
<p>Sometimes, more severe illness</p>
<p>than something that just slows you down.</p>
<p>So I think taking, getting sleep,</p>
<p>I mean, there have been studies on this that,</p>
<p>executives, for example, who get a full night&rsquo;s sleep</p>
<p>and stop at a reasonable hour,</p>
<p>actually accomplish more, are more productive</p>
<p>than people who work and burn the midnight oil</p>
<p>because their brains are working better</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re well rested.</p>
<p>So, you know, working hard, yes,</p>
<p>but why not work smart?</p>
<p>I think that giving our minds and our bodies rest</p>
<p>makes us more efficient.</p>
<p>I think just driving, driving, driving, driving</p>
<p>is a short term, it&rsquo;s a short term strategy.</p>
<p>So, but to push back on that a little bit,</p>
<p>the annoying thing is you&rsquo;re like 100% right</p>
<p>in terms of science, right?</p>
<p>But the thing is, because you&rsquo;re 100% right,</p>
<p>that weak part of your mind uses that fact</p>
<p>to convince you, like what, so, you know,</p>
<p>I get all kinds of, my mind comes up</p>
<p>with all kinds of excuses to try to convince me</p>
<p>that I shouldn&rsquo;t be doing what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>To rationalize. To rationalize.</p>
<p>And so what I have a sense,</p>
<p>I think what you said about executives and leaders</p>
<p>is absolutely right, but there&rsquo;s the early days.</p>
<p>The early days of madness and passion.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>Then I feel like emphasizing sleep,</p>
<p>thinking about sleep is giving yourself a way out</p>
<p>from the fact that those early days,</p>
<p>especially, can be suffering.</p>
<p>As long, it&rsquo;s not sustainable.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not sustainable.</p>
<p>Sure, if you&rsquo;re investing all that energy in something</p>
<p>at the beginning to get it up and running,</p>
<p>then at some point you&rsquo;re gonna have to slow down.</p>
<p>Or your body will slow you down for you.</p>
<p>Like, you can choose or your body can choose.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>So, okay, so you don&rsquo;t think, from my perspective,</p>
<p>it feels like people have gotten a little bit soft.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying, no.</p>
<p>I think that there seems evidence</p>
<p>that working harder and later have taken a back seat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken a back seat.</p>
<p>I think we have to be careful with broad generalizations.</p>
<p>But I think if you go into the workplace,</p>
<p>there are people who would complain</p>
<p>that more people now than before,</p>
<p>you know, look at their watches and say,</p>
<p>oops, five o clock, goodbye.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Now, is that a problem with the people?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s the people giving themselves excuses</p>
<p>and people who don&rsquo;t work hard.</p>
<p>Or is it the organizations aren&rsquo;t giving them something</p>
<p>to believe in, something to be passionate about?</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t manufacture passion.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just tell someone, be passionate.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s not how it works.</p>
<p>Passion&rsquo;s an output, not an input.</p>
<p>Like if I believe in something</p>
<p>and I wanna contribute all that energy to do it,</p>
<p>we call that passion.</p>
<p>You know, working hard for something we love is passion.</p>
<p>Working hard for something we don&rsquo;t care about</p>
<p>is called stress.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re working hard either way.</p>
<p>So I think the organizations bear some accountability</p>
<p>and our leaders bear some accountability,</p>
<p>which is if they&rsquo;re not offering a sense of purpose,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re not offering us a sense of cause,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re not telling us that our work is worth more</p>
<p>than simply the money it makes,</p>
<p>then yeah, I&rsquo;m gonna come at five o clock</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t really care about making you money.</p>
<p>Remember, we live in a world right now</p>
<p>where a lot of people, rather a few people,</p>
<p>are getting rich on the hard work of others.</p>
<p>And so I think when people look up and say,</p>
<p>well, why would I do that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just, if you&rsquo;re not gonna look after me</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re gonna lay me off at the end of the year</p>
<p>because you missed your arbitrary projections,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re gonna lay me off</p>
<p>because you missed your arbitrary projections,</p>
<p>then why would I offer my hard work and loyalty to you?</p>
<p>So I think, I don&rsquo;t think we can immediately blame people</p>
<p>for going soft.</p>
<p>I think we can blame leaders for their inability</p>
<p>or failure to offer their people something bigger</p>
<p>than making a product or making money.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>And start with why, leaders eat less, your books.</p>
<p>You basically talk about what it takes to be a good leader.</p>
<p>And so some of the blame should go on the leader,</p>
<p>but how much of it is on finding your passion?</p>
<p>How much is it on the individual?</p>
<p>And allowing yourself to pursue that passion,</p>
<p>pushing yourself to your limits,</p>
<p>to really take concrete steps</p>
<p>along your path towards that passion.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s mutual responsibility.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s mutual accountability.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re responsible as individuals</p>
<p>to find the organizations and find the leaders</p>
<p>that inspire us.</p>
<p>And organizations are responsible for maintaining</p>
<p>that flame and giving people who believe</p>
<p>what they believed, you know, a chance to contribute.</p>
<p>Sort of to linger on it,</p>
<p>have you by chance seen the movie Whiplash?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Again, maybe I&rsquo;m romanticizing suffering.</p>
<p>Again. It&rsquo;s the Russian in you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Russian. Yeah.</p>
<p>The Russians love suffering.</p>
<p>But for people who haven&rsquo;t seen,</p>
<p>the movie Whiplash has a drum instructor</p>
<p>that pushes the drum musician to his limits</p>
<p>to bring out the best in him.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a toxic nature to it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s suffering in it.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;ve worked with a lot of great leaders,</p>
<p>a lot of great individuals.</p>
<p>So is that toxic relationship as toxic</p>
<p>as it appears in the movie?</p>
<p>Or is that fundamental?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen that relationship,</p>
<p>especially in the past with Olympic athletes,</p>
<p>especially in athletics, extreme performers</p>
<p>seem to do wonders.</p>
<p>It does wonders for me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some of my best relationships,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m not representative of everyone certainly,</p>
<p>but some of my best relationships for mentee and mentor</p>
<p>have been toxic from an external perspective.</p>
<p>What do you make of that movie?</p>
<p>What do you make of that kind of relationship?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not my favorite movie.</p>
<p>Okay, so you don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a healthy,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think that kind of relationship</p>
<p>is a great example of a great leader?</p>
<p>No, I think it&rsquo;s a short term strategy.</p>
<p>I mean, short term.</p>
<p>I mean, look, being hard on someone</p>
<p>is not the same as toxicity.</p>
<p>If you go to the Marine Corps,</p>
<p>a drill instructor will be very hard on their Marines.</p>
<p>And then, but still, even on the last day of bootcamp,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll take their hat off and they&rsquo;ll become a human.</p>
<p>But of all the drill instructors,</p>
<p>you know, the three or four main drill instructors</p>
<p>assigned to a group of recruits,</p>
<p>the one that they all want the respect of</p>
<p>is the one that&rsquo;s the hardest on them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And you hear, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s plenty of stories of people</p>
<p>who want to earn the respect of a hard parent</p>
<p>or a hard teacher.</p>
<p>But fundamental, that parent, that teacher,</p>
<p>that drill instructor has to believe in that person,</p>
<p>has to see potential in them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a formula,</p>
<p>which is if I&rsquo;m hard on people, they&rsquo;ll do well,</p>
<p>which is there has to still be love.</p>
<p>It has to be done with absolute love.</p>
<p>And it has to be done responsibly.</p>
<p>I mean, some people can take</p>
<p>a little more pressure than others,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not, I think it&rsquo;s irresponsible</p>
<p>to think of it as a formula</p>
<p>that if I&rsquo;m just toxic at people, they will do well.</p>
<p>It depends on their personalities.</p>
<p>First of all, it works for some, but not all.</p>
<p>And second of all, it can&rsquo;t be done willy nilly.</p>
<p>It has to still be done with care and love.</p>
<p>And sometimes you can get equal or better results</p>
<p>without all of the toxicity.</p>
<p>So one of the, I guess toxicity on my part</p>
<p>was a really bad word to use,</p>
<p>but if we talk about what makes a good leader</p>
<p>and just look at an example in particular,</p>
<p>looking at Elon Musk,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s known to push people to their limits</p>
<p>in a way that I think really challenges people</p>
<p>in a way they&rsquo;ve never been challenged before</p>
<p>to do the impossible.</p>
<p>But it can really break people.</p>
<p>And jobs was hard and Amazon is hard.</p>
<p>But the thing that&rsquo;s important is none of them lie about it.</p>
<p>People ask me about Amazon all the time.</p>
<p>Like Jeff Bezos never lied about it.</p>
<p>Even the ones who like Amazon don&rsquo;t last</p>
<p>more than a couple of years before they burn out.</p>
<p>But when we&rsquo;re honest about the culture,</p>
<p>then it gives people the opportunity</p>
<p>who like to work in that kind of culture</p>
<p>to choose to work in that kind of culture,</p>
<p>as opposed to pretending and saying,</p>
<p>oh no, this is all, it&rsquo;s all lovey lovey here.</p>
<p>And then you show up and it&rsquo;s the furthest thing from it.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I think the reputations</p>
<p>of putting a lot of pressure on people to,</p>
<p>jobs was not an easy man to work for.</p>
<p>He pushed people, but everyone who worked there</p>
<p>was given the space to create and do things</p>
<p>that they would not have been able to do anywhere else</p>
<p>and work at a level that they didn&rsquo;t work anywhere else.</p>
<p>And jobs didn&rsquo;t have all the answers.</p>
<p>I mean, he pushed his people to come up with answers.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t just looking for people to execute his ideas.</p>
<p>And people did, people accomplished more</p>
<p>than they thought they were capable of, which is wonderful.</p>
<p>How do you, you&rsquo;re talking about the infinite game</p>
<p>and not thinking about too short term.</p>
<p>And yet you see some of the most brilliant people</p>
<p>in the world being pushed by Elam us</p>
<p>to accomplish some of the most incredible things.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re talking about autopilot,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re talking about some of the hardware engineering,</p>
<p>and they do some of the best work of their life</p>
<p>and then leave.</p>
<p>How do you balance that in terms of what it takes</p>
<p>to be a good leader,</p>
<p>what it takes to accomplish great things in your life?</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a difference between someone</p>
<p>who can get a lot out of people in the short term</p>
<p>and building an organization</p>
<p>that can sustain beyond any individual.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a difference.</p>
<p>When you say beyond any individual,</p>
<p>you mean beyond like if the leader dies.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Like could Tesla continue to do what it&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>without Elon Musk?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re perhaps implying,</p>
<p>which is a very interesting question that it cannot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You know, the argument you&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>of this person who pushes everyone</p>
<p>arguably is not a repeatable model, right?</p>
<p>You know, is Apple the same without Steve Jobs</p>
<p>or is it slowly moving in a different direction?</p>
<p>Or has he established something</p>
<p>that could be resurrected with the right leader?</p>
<p>That was his dream, I think,</p>
<p>is to build an organization that lives on beyond them.</p>
<p>At least I remember reading that somewhere.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what a lot of leaders desire,</p>
<p>which is to create something that was bigger than them.</p>
<p>You know, most businesses, most entrepreneurial ventures</p>
<p>could not pass the school bus test,</p>
<p>which is if the founder was hit by a school bus,</p>
<p>would everyone continue the business without them</p>
<p>or would they all just go find jobs?</p>
<p>And the vast majority of companies would fail that test,</p>
<p>you know, especially in the entrepreneurial world</p>
<p>that if you take the inspired visionary leader away,</p>
<p>the whole thing collapses.</p>
<p>So is that a business</p>
<p>or is that just a force of personality?</p>
<p>And a lot of entrepreneurs, you know, face that reality,</p>
<p>which is they have to be in every meeting,</p>
<p>make every decision, you know, come up with every idea,</p>
<p>because if they don&rsquo;t, who will?</p>
<p>And the question is, is, well,</p>
<p>what have you done to build your bench?</p>
<p>Is it, it&rsquo;s not, sometimes it&rsquo;s ego,</p>
<p>the belief that only I can.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s just things got,</p>
<p>did so well for so long that just forgot.</p>
<p>And sometimes it&rsquo;s a failure</p>
<p>to build the training programs or hire the right people</p>
<p>that could replace you,</p>
<p>who are maybe smarter and better.</p>
<p>And browbeating people is only one strategy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessarily the only strategy,</p>
<p>nor is it always the best strategy.</p>
<p>I think people get to choose the cultures</p>
<p>they wanna work in.</p>
<p>This is why I think companies should be honest</p>
<p>about the kind of culture that they&rsquo;ve created.</p>
<p>You know, I heard a story about Apple</p>
<p>where somebody came in from a big company,</p>
<p>you know, he had accomplished a lot</p>
<p>and his ego was very large</p>
<p>and he was going on about how he did this and he did that</p>
<p>and he did this and he did that.</p>
<p>And somebody from Apple said,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t care what you&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>The question is, what are you gonna do?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know, for somebody who wants to be pushed,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the place you go because you choose to be pushed.</p>
<p>Now, we all wanna be pushed to some degree,</p>
<p>you know, anybody who wants to, you know,</p>
<p>accomplish anything in this world</p>
<p>wants to be pushed to some degree,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s through self pressure or external pressure</p>
<p>or, you know, public pressure, whatever it is.</p>
<p>But I think this whole idea of one size fits all</p>
<p>is a false narrative of how leadership works,</p>
<p>but what all leadership requires is creating an environment</p>
<p>in which people can work at their natural best.</p>
<p>But you have a sense that it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>to create a business where it lives on beyond you.</p>
<p>So if we look at now,</p>
<p>if we just look at this current moment,</p>
<p>I just recently talked to Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s under a lot of pressure now.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re aware of the news</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s being pushed out as a potential CEO of Twitter</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s the CEO already</p>
<p>of an incredibly successful company</p>
<p>plus he wants to go to Africa to live a few months in Africa</p>
<p>to connect with the world that&rsquo;s outside of the Silicon Valley</p>
<p>and sort of, there&rsquo;s this idea,</p>
<p>well, can Twitter live without Jack?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll find out.</p>
<p>But you have a general, as a student of great leadership,</p>
<p>you have a general sense that it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I mean, what Bill Gates built with Microsoft</p>
<p>may not have survived Steve Ballmer</p>
<p>if the company weren&rsquo;t so rich,</p>
<p>but Sachin Ardala is putting it back on track again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become a visionary company again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s attracting great talent again.</p>
<p>It went through a period</p>
<p>where they couldn&rsquo;t get the best talent</p>
<p>and the best talent was leaving.</p>
<p>Now people wanna work for Microsoft again.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not because of pressure.</p>
<p>Ballmer put more pressure on people</p>
<p>mainly to hit numbers than anything else.</p>
<p>That didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Yes. Right?</p>
<p>And so the question is,</p>
<p>what kind of pressure are we putting on people?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re putting on pressure people to hit numbers</p>
<p>or hit arbitrary deadlines,</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re putting on pressure on people</p>
<p>because we believe that they can do better work.</p>
<p>And the work that we&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>is to advance a vision that&rsquo;s bigger than all of us.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re gonna put pressure on people,</p>
<p>it better be for the right reason.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re gonna put pressure on me,</p>
<p>it better be for a worthwhile reason.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s just to hit a goal,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s just to hit some arbitrary date</p>
<p>or some arbitrary number or make a stock price</p>
<p>hit some target, you can keep it, I&rsquo;m outta here.</p>
<p>But if you wanna put pressure on me</p>
<p>because we are brothers and sisters in arms</p>
<p>working to advance a cause bigger than ourselves,</p>
<p>that we believe whatever we&rsquo;re gonna build</p>
<p>will significantly contribute</p>
<p>to the greater good of society,</p>
<p>then go ahead, I&rsquo;ll take the pressure.</p>
<p>And if you look at the Apples</p>
<p>and if you look at the Elon Musk&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>the Jobs and the Elon Musk,</p>
<p>they fundamentally believed that what they were doing</p>
<p>would improve society.</p>
<p>And it was for the good of humankind.</p>
<p>And so the pressure, in other words,</p>
<p>what they were doing was more important,</p>
<p>more valuable than any individual on the team.</p>
<p>And so the pressure they put on people</p>
<p>served a greater good.</p>
<p>And so we looked to the left</p>
<p>and we looked to the right to each other and said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in this together.</p>
<p>We accept this, we want this.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s just pressure to hit a number</p>
<p>or make the widget move a little faster,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s soul sucking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not passion, that&rsquo;s stress.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of leaders confuse</p>
<p>that making people work hard</p>
<p>is not what makes them passionate.</p>
<p>Giving to them something to believe in</p>
<p>and work on is what drives passion.</p>
<p>And when you have that, then turning up the pressure</p>
<p>only brings people together,</p>
<p>drives them further.</p>
<p>If done the right way.</p>
<p>Speaking of pressure,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give you 90 seconds to answer the last question,</p>
<p>which is if I told you that tomorrow</p>
<p>was your last day to live,</p>
<p>we talked about mortality,</p>
<p>sunrise to sunset, can you tell me,</p>
<p>can you take me through the day?</p>
<p>What do you think that day would involve?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t spend it with your family,</p>
<p>I told you as well.</p>
<p>I would probably want to fill all of my senses</p>
<p>with things that excite my senses.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d want to look at beautiful art.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d want to listen to beautiful music.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d want to taste incredible food.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d want to smell amazing tastes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d want to touch something that&rsquo;s beautiful to touch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d want all of my senses to just be consumed</p>
<p>with things that I find beautiful.</p>
<p>And you talked about this idea of</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t do it often these days,</p>
<p>of just listening to music, turning off all the devices</p>
<p>and actually taking in and listening to music.</p>
<p>So as an addendum,</p>
<p>if we were to talk about music,</p>
<p>what song would you be blasting</p>
<p>on this last day you&rsquo;re alive?</p>
<p>Is it Led Zeppelin?</p>
<p>What are we talking about?</p>
<p>That I love.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably gonna be a Beatles song in there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll definitely be some Beethoven in there.</p>
<p>The classics.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Well, thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>Thank you for making time for it.</p>
<p>Under pressure, we made it happen.</p>
<p>It was great.</p>
