    <p>You want to run a marathon at 57 years old. 52 51 to 52. I&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>honest, I miss you. Can you come back to the United States,</p>
<p>please? I miss you. I will. I miss you too. I mean, the poker</p>
<p>game can&rsquo;t by definition be as much fun if I&rsquo;m not there. It</p>
<p>plays at bigger states, and it&rsquo;s more challenging, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not as much fun. There&rsquo;s not as much laughing. What&rsquo;s on the</p>
<p>menu tonight for austerity 2023. The amuse bouche is a</p>
<p>Madeline with like a terrain of foie gras. Fantastic. In honor</p>
<p>of Friberg, and then rutabaga rutabaga salad, and then some</p>
<p>duck thing, duck breast, you know, I love duck. And then</p>
<p>and then butterscotch panna cotta. Wow, that is great lineup.</p>
<p>And you know what, I like the idea. We&rsquo;re doing some poultry</p>
<p>chef Sean is firing on all cylinders these days. If he</p>
<p>feels very like engaged. He was very engaged. Yeah, he&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of going for it. He&rsquo;s been on Yeah, that was quite nice. The</p>
<p>other day, Brad, because it&rsquo;s austerity measures. We had this</p>
<p>incredible dish, and we&rsquo;re eating it. And then he said,</p>
<p>the caviar is on the bottom. And I was like, Oh, so we just we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t put the caviar on top. They just put it on the markets</p>
<p>down. That&rsquo;s chipmunk style austerity. I&rsquo;m not lying. Am I</p>
<p>lying? Oh my god. No, he did say guys, the caviar is on the</p>
<p>bottom, not the top this week.</p>
<p>All right, Sax is here, everybody. So that means we</p>
<p>have a quorum. Hopefully, the sultan of science, who is on</p>
<p>Wall Street today, taking a company public. So congrats to</p>
<p>our bestie Friedberg. Ding, ding. He couldn&rsquo;t make it. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>at a dinner. So with us, the fifth beetle, as it were, Brad</p>
<p>Gerstner is here to talk all things macro. Welcome back to</p>
<p>the pod. How&rsquo;s life been? Good to be back a little domo</p>
<p>arigato to Jason as you eat your way through Japan. Yes, I</p>
<p>am on my culinary tour. I&rsquo;ll be back Sunday. But I am having the</p>
<p>time of my life here. Are you running AdWords on your food</p>
<p>blog? That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s come back to. I&rsquo;m back to the web</p>
<p>locks Inc. days. I&rsquo;m just trying to make $2,600 a day. I</p>
<p>noticed your Tick Tock got 22 likes. Yeah, you know, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to figure out Tick Tock. I&rsquo;m gonna but you know, but</p>
<p>right as they shut it down. That&rsquo;s when I&rsquo;ll figure it out.</p>
<p>Will that rev sure buy you another Japanese pancake or no</p>
<p>those pancakes man are next level. The fluffy pancakes here</p>
<p>roof. Everything actually with the exchange rate coming to</p>
<p>Japan is so affordable. It&rsquo;s nuts. And this is a crazy week</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the it&rsquo;s the Tokyo Marathon, but everything is so</p>
<p>affordable. The people are amazing. It&rsquo;s the best country</p>
<p>to visit in the world. I think, for me, it&rsquo;s Italy, Spain, I</p>
<p>mean, Italy&rsquo;s right up there, too. But I would say Japan is</p>
<p>like, it&rsquo;s definitely top two or three. What do you love about</p>
<p>it? Best food. You know, I went there I took the I took because</p>
<p>like five years ago, the older three at the time. But they were</p>
<p>younger. And you know, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a negative birth rate</p>
<p>in Japan. And so number one, when you have any kid, but</p>
<p>frankly, multiple kids, the the Japanese embrace you with so</p>
<p>much love because they love seeing these big families. Yeah.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re unbelievably kind. We went to Kyoto did the</p>
<p>professor&rsquo;s walk saw the cherry blossom festival, basically ate</p>
<p>our way through Japan. That was my that was my only vacation</p>
<p>trip I did. I&rsquo;ve done like 10 or 12 trips for work. Once we I</p>
<p>went with Reid Hoffman. And Reid set up this thing where we went</p>
<p>through all these different parts of Tokyo and ate at the</p>
<p>incredible sushi place. You have to go with somebody who can dial</p>
<p>it in. Yes. And have all the hookups. Brad, you spend much</p>
<p>time in Tokyo and Japan. I haven&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve been there only</p>
<p>twice. And that was when I was poor. And I stayed in a really</p>
<p>small room and ate really shitty food. All right. So you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying in 20 in 2022, when you became Oregon hotel, we have</p>
<p>rooms. He&rsquo;s like, is there a hostel? Yeah. All right. And</p>
<p>with us, of course, the next department, what cabinet</p>
<p>position you&rsquo;re going for sacks, which we should we start</p>
<p>floating here? Oh, my god. Here you are with the</p>
<p>disinformation starting already. It&rsquo;s a compliment. Secretary of</p>
<p>SAS is with us. to Santa&rsquo;s had a pretty great article in the</p>
<p>Wall Street Journal. Really? I&rsquo;m so when they revoked the</p>
<p>special administrative status for Disney, he wrote an article,</p>
<p>I think it was Wednesday, Tuesday or Wednesday in the in</p>
<p>the Wall Street op ed. What was his premise that they was a</p>
<p>corporate or as a culture that woke ism is basically modern</p>
<p>Marxism, and we have to defeat it. This is his language, not</p>
<p>mine, at every turn. And Disney needs to just be business</p>
<p>people and not feed the vocal minorities inside of their</p>
<p>company, like every other company should they should be</p>
<p>subject to shareholder concerns that apply to the majority of</p>
<p>shareholders? Well, I think this is why I think DeSantis is</p>
<p>doing well with the Republican base. And you know, if you see</p>
<p>polling of the Republican primary is he understands that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not good enough just to have this sort of Reagan s</p>
<p>totally hands off government approach, because the radical</p>
<p>left is advancing its agenda, not just legislatively, but</p>
<p>through corporations through ESG, really through taking over</p>
<p>key private sector institutions. And so he&rsquo;s willing</p>
<p>to use government to push back on that agenda on behalf of</p>
<p>parents or on behalf of, you know, what he sees as the</p>
<p>majority of the country. And so it&rsquo;s a very different approach</p>
<p>than you know, the Republican Party would have been 30 or 40</p>
<p>years ago. This is why, you know, in the parlance of the</p>
<p>base, he understands what time it is. And what&rsquo;s required here</p>
<p>is not again, this totally laser fair approach, but rather, a</p>
<p>much more energetic, aggressive approach towards checking these</p>
<p>bad ideas wherever they come from.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the only one. I don&rsquo;t know if you saw this week, Bill</p>
<p>Maher went on a bit of a press tour, and he was on with Jake</p>
<p>Tapper. And he made a very interesting, I think, point</p>
<p>about liberalism versus woke ism. And it was quite articulate,</p>
<p>you know, he&rsquo;s a pretty good observer of culture, he said,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of casting out the liberals in the party for this</p>
<p>woke ism and the intolerant nature of the woke movement</p>
<p>versus the liberal movement, specifically, under the lens of</p>
<p>trans rights. But let&rsquo;s put that aside for now, we got a</p>
<p>full docket before we get into the culture wars and the</p>
<p>presidential elections. Let&rsquo;s start with, we&rsquo;ll go private</p>
<p>markets to public markets, because they obviously dovetail</p>
<p>so nicely. Item one on the docket today, there is just a</p>
<p>massive AI FOMO frenzy going on. economists published a piece</p>
<p>this week about the insane fundraising in the generative AI</p>
<p>space. This is stuff like chat GPT, stable diffusion, you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard these names. And there are now 500 generative AI</p>
<p>startups, according to this report that tracks with what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing in the early stage and not counting the open AI 10</p>
<p>Billy from Microsoft investment donation, rev share roundtrip,</p>
<p>whatever that is, they have so far collectively raised more</p>
<p>than $11 billion. The article included this chart, which you</p>
<p>can see if you&rsquo;re on our YouTube channel, and just tons</p>
<p>of folks working in audio image, and text. So we&rsquo;re basically</p>
<p>looking at the multimedia, basically revolution of PCs in</p>
<p>the 90s, occurring again, and complete platform platform</p>
<p>shift. Doug Leone from Sequoia, one of the greatest investors in</p>
<p>history of Silicon Valley had this to say, and we will comment</p>
<p>on the other side of this 52nd clip from Doug.</p>
<p>I actually think that AI is the next platform shift, in the</p>
<p>same way that mobile was the one before internet was the one</p>
<p>before. So I think AI is real. But I said earlier, we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to overestimate it in the short term, we&rsquo;re going to invest in</p>
<p>everything in the same way that in 1999, we invested in</p>
<p>everything. But then Google came out of that, or Facebook came</p>
<p>out of that. So I think you have to have a good head on your</p>
<p>shoulder, where you don&rsquo;t practice FOMO, where you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>chase every company, AI is real, AI is the next platform. But how</p>
<p>do we not invest in everything that walks? How do we make</p>
<p>certain investments based on market maps based on thought</p>
<p>processes that are more rational, and not do every</p>
<p>investment just because every other venture firm is doing</p>
<p>everything best. All right, Chamath, what do you think of</p>
<p>this massive influx? I think it&rsquo;s important to think about</p>
<p>what the incentives are, as Charlie Munger says, show me the</p>
<p>incentive, and I&rsquo;ll show you the outcome. I posted it into our</p>
<p>group chat credits, we sent all their private banking customers</p>
<p>an offer, they are now offering 6.5% for a three month T bill</p>
<p>6.5%. And if you go back to what we talked about before, when</p>
<p>the risk free rate is somewhere north of five or five and a half</p>
<p>percent, and banks are willing to give you six and a half</p>
<p>percent in the short term, you have to generate more than three</p>
<p>times that to make an investment makes sense when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>investing in the long term. So if three month money is going to</p>
<p>pay you six and a half or seven, if you&rsquo;re going to invest for</p>
<p>1015 years, which is what you need to do typically for a</p>
<p>startup, you need to get 20 to 25%. So there&rsquo;s going to be a</p>
<p>lot of pressure for venture investors to put the money to</p>
<p>work. Because otherwise, their LPS, their limited partners, the</p>
<p>people that give them the money will have this attitude that goes</p>
<p>somewhere along the following lines, okay, I&rsquo;ve committed to</p>
<p>you. Why aren&rsquo;t you investing? Because otherwise, I can get</p>
<p>paid six and a half percent on the front end. And so this is</p>
<p>becoming very problematic. What am I paying you for? What am I</p>
<p>paying you 2% a year in management fee for? So I think</p>
<p>what happens, unfortunately, is the opposite of what Doug says,</p>
<p>I think good investors will try to follow Doug&rsquo;s feedback and</p>
<p>advice. And the ones that have a track record of distributions</p>
<p>of DPI can do more of it than not. But I think most people</p>
<p>will be under pressure to deploy the capital. And so the</p>
<p>500 odd companies, Jason, you mentioned, we&rsquo;ll get a lot of</p>
<p>it, and it&rsquo;ll get torched, because most of them probably</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t amount to much of anything in the short term, you</p>
<p>will create way too much correlation, and you will have</p>
<p>zero time diversity, which, as we&rsquo;ve learned, is a recipe for</p>
<p>terrible returns.</p>
<p>Time diversity being Hey, you deployed all this web to capital</p>
<p>web three capital, sorry, crypto, whatever, in this very</p>
<p>short period of time, you overpaid.</p>
<p>Let it on fire, Brad, when you hear Chamath talk about this 6.5%,</p>
<p>and then you look at private markets, you invest across the</p>
<p>lifecycle of companies, obviously, you&rsquo;re in some</p>
<p>private companies, we all know very well, famously, snowflake,</p>
<p>I think your biggest win ever, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong. And in</p>
<p>terms of a private, how do you look at this? When you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>steward of capital, public markets, private markets, and</p>
<p>then just YOLO, just put it into, you know, some charity</p>
<p>bills, or, you know, bonds or whatever.</p>
<p>I mean, first, let&rsquo;s just frame, right, the chart that you</p>
<p>showed, I think you should, it said, you know, x open AI, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know, something like 10 or $11 billion has been invested</p>
<p>into some 500 AI companies. I mean, I happen to agree with Doug</p>
<p>that this is a platform shift on the same magnitude as the</p>
<p>internet or mobile itself. In fact, it may be bigger than both</p>
<p>of those. But, you know, when I look at 10 or $11 billion, you</p>
<p>know, let&rsquo;s put it in context, meta is going to spend 20 billion</p>
<p>in one year alone on AR via. And this is on an entire</p>
<p>platform. So I don&rsquo;t know, I, I think whenever you have</p>
<p>something as tectonic as mobile or internet, it deserves a lot</p>
<p>of investment. And yes, it&rsquo;s going to be messy. And yes,</p>
<p>Chamath&rsquo;s right, the cost of capital, frankly, is limiting</p>
<p>the amount of money going into these businesses already. So we</p>
<p>see a lot of dry powder sitting on the sideline, this chasing</p>
<p>new ideas. I think one way one way to frame it as well is like,</p>
<p>think about in 2000. We all knew that the internet was going to</p>
<p>be big, we may have been lucky enough to conclude that search</p>
<p>was going to be big. But if you invest in in Yahoo, or Infoseek,</p>
<p>or AOL, or Excite, you know, you torque all that money went to</p>
<p>zero. Right. So now think about just these large language</p>
<p>models, right, the foundation models, which are driving and</p>
<p>enabling all of it, OpenAI. You&rsquo;ve got OpenAI, you got</p>
<p>Anthropic, you got Cohere, you got Character, you got</p>
<p>Stability, you&rsquo;ve got Lambda. It is almost impossible to know</p>
<p>with any certainty, much like it was with the search engines in</p>
<p>99, 2000, who&rsquo;s going to emerge where the value capture is going</p>
<p>to be, it may all end up with Microsoft and Google. I mean,</p>
<p>this may end up looking like iOS and Android at the foundation</p>
<p>model level. And so, you know, I think as investors, for example,</p>
<p>on the foundation model side, I think it&rsquo;s very difficult to</p>
<p>choose just one, particularly when the largest one is,</p>
<p>frankly, captive and a proxy to Microsoft, and they&rsquo;re capping</p>
<p>your upside return. So like, those are difficult investment</p>
<p>decisions. That doesn&rsquo;t detract from the fact that I think it is</p>
<p>as big as Doug suggests. And I do think there are going to be</p>
<p>applications and tooling layer to come out of this that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to produce really big winners. I would say that we are spending</p>
<p>an extraordinary amount of time in the space, we haven&rsquo;t made a</p>
<p>lot of investments, I think you have to study, you have to get</p>
<p>deep. I mean, Chamath, certainly, and I have been</p>
<p>investing in this space for at least a decade, maybe 15 years.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t underestimate that the transformer model really did</p>
<p>change the game here. And we&rsquo;re now producing impacts much</p>
<p>larger.</p>
<p>Saks, last week, you said, lab three and crypto didn&rsquo;t kind of</p>
<p>stick with you, you didn&rsquo;t see the use cases. And you in the</p>
<p>first inning here, or first at bat, you rattled off three or</p>
<p>four really compelling use cases from summaries to you know, the</p>
<p>assistant guide on your side concept. Is this akin in your</p>
<p>mind, because Brad just said it could be bigger than mobile,</p>
<p>internet, mobile, AI revolution, if you were to look at those</p>
<p>three, do you think it&rsquo;s bigger than actually mobile, and then</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get into return profiles of 6.5% on cash versus what our</p>
<p>VC is going to be able to do in this kind of market?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, so I agree with Brad and Doug, that this is the</p>
<p>next big platform shift, whether it&rsquo;s as big as mobile, or it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more like social or cloud. I mean, those have been the big</p>
<p>platform shifts over the last decade or two. And I think this</p>
<p>is definitely on par with those, I think Brad&rsquo;s right, we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know where the value capture is going to be, maybe it just all</p>
<p>ends up accreting to the big companies who can make massive</p>
<p>investments in the space. You know, one difference between the</p>
<p>internet ecosystem today and 20 years ago is you do have these</p>
<p>giant companies who are not totally incompetent, right? I</p>
<p>mean, they are, they do have lots of talented engineers. And,</p>
<p>you know, like 20 years ago, you&rsquo;d have company, you know,</p>
<p>the big companies would just sit on their hands in the face of a</p>
<p>platform shift, and they&rsquo;d just be sitting ducks who get</p>
<p>disrupted, they&rsquo;re not, that&rsquo;s not going to happen today. That</p>
<p>being said, I do think that any new platform shifts creates</p>
<p>opportunities for startups. And it may not be efficient the way</p>
<p>that these opportunities get pursued in the sense that yeah,</p>
<p>Doug&rsquo;s right that there&rsquo;s me a lot of spray and pray. But I</p>
<p>think that it is kind of efficient for the ecosystem as a</p>
<p>whole, right? Because like any smart engineer with a half</p>
<p>decent idea ends up getting funded. And out of all of that,</p>
<p>you get kind of a pre Cambrian explosion where, you know, the</p>
<p>ecosystem evolves a lot of different types of businesses,</p>
<p>most of them don&rsquo;t work, they get wiped out, they go extinct,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;ll be some good things that get funded. So we&rsquo;re more</p>
<p>like I think, Doug, and how we see it, we don&rsquo;t want to spray</p>
<p>and pray want to be very selective, we want to put more</p>
<p>money behind fewer opportunities that we think are better. And</p>
<p>Doug Leoni, you know, I think he generally gives good advice of</p>
<p>the tough love variety. And this is of a piece with that. And so</p>
<p>I agree with him. That being said, there is a certain value</p>
<p>to the ecosystem and having all these seed funds to spray and</p>
<p>pray, right? Because this gets a lot of plants, a lot of flowers,</p>
<p>and then you see what blooms,</p>
<p>I would say, yeah, to build on that sax, this is a perfect</p>
<p>inefficiency. You know, you when you see it from the outside,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, well, this is super inefficient. Why so many</p>
<p>companies, if you free your mind, and just say their</p>
<p>experiments, two or three person experiments, 500k to a million</p>
<p>and a half in that first stage, when I invest right before you</p>
<p>do when you do your series is at five or 10 million. Milestone</p>
<p>based funding is back in the tech industry. And that was</p>
<p>something chamath that we lost for a little while there, people</p>
<p>would just come out and they would raise a series B out of</p>
<p>the gate, no product market fit, etc. Now what we&rsquo;re seeing is</p>
<p>people are raising that 12 to 18 months, they got their backs up</p>
<p>against the wall. Speaking of tough love, which you reference</p>
<p>sacks, that tough love of Hey, you have to hit the next</p>
<p>milestone. What did you accomplish with the 1.5 million</p>
<p>in order to get the 10 million in order to get the 30 million</p>
<p>that 500 is going to go 10x, there&rsquo;ll be 5000 of these</p>
<p>startups, but it&rsquo;ll quickly whittle down when a chamath as</p>
<p>people go through this milestone based funding system in Silicon</p>
<p>Valley,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t given enough time for a logical framework of</p>
<p>investing to develop, which also is tied to a logical framework</p>
<p>for entrepreneurship to emerge. We&rsquo;re just way, way, way too</p>
<p>early. So the thing with all of these language models is that</p>
<p>they are grist for the mill. And we talked about this before,</p>
<p>if it was a highly proprietary asset, you would have never sold</p>
<p>49% of it to Microsoft for $10 billion, because you would</p>
<p>assume that it was worth a trillion dollars. So it&rsquo;s a huge</p>
<p>tell on the part of open AI, their deep understanding, and</p>
<p>they understand it better than anybody else, that it&rsquo;s a bit of</p>
<p>a capped upside. So what is uncapped, I guess, is maybe the</p>
<p>better question. Well, if you look at the 1849 gold rush, as</p>
<p>an example, the people panning for gold, in my opinion, are the</p>
<p>people building language models today, they&rsquo;re going to come and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to go, but who&rsquo;s going to win? Well, the pick and</p>
<p>shovel providers one, Levi Strauss one. So what is the</p>
<p>equivalent of that today? I think it&rsquo;s at the silicon layer,</p>
<p>because you need to really re architect how compute will</p>
<p>actually work in a world of all of these models, those folks</p>
<p>will get paid. If you look at AMD and Nvidia, they&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>getting paid for years, they continue to get paid, they</p>
<p>probably will continue to get paid even more. And so folks</p>
<p>that actually take a step into doing something hard and</p>
<p>difficult in AI, like custom silicon could get rewarded. And</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s what I call the white truffles. What are these</p>
<p>unique Alba white truffles, these singular sources of data</p>
<p>that when used in reinforcement learning, make your output</p>
<p>just zinc. And that&rsquo;s where I think Facebook is an obvious</p>
<p>white truffle core as a white truffle, but there are a lot of</p>
<p>startups that could become white truffles, if they gather</p>
<p>enough data. And that&rsquo;s like a pretty reasonable framework. And</p>
<p>so in that framework, if you apply to today, there&rsquo;s way few</p>
<p>silicon startups, and there&rsquo;s way few white truffles. Instead,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s everything is the baloney in the middle, which is random</p>
<p>people talking about some random model that&rsquo;s just going</p>
<p>to again become highly commoditized. You have to</p>
<p>remember, all these models are open source, then none of them</p>
<p>mean anything in the absence of the data you give it to train</p>
<p>on. 100% Brad, hey, okay.</p>
<p>Well, I want to add one other piece of news that we saw this</p>
<p>week, which is open AI announced that its developer AI, they were</p>
<p>cutting the tax on that are basically the metered rate, they</p>
<p>charge to use it by 90%. So I think this is gonna be a game</p>
<p>changer. I think this is based on the chat GPT 3.5 API. And of</p>
<p>course, you&rsquo;re coming out with 4.0. Later this year, I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>already had explained to the audience what an API is and why</p>
<p>this is important. And for those people who don&rsquo;t know, this</p>
<p>application programming interface, it allows a developer</p>
<p>of some other application to build on top of you. So in other</p>
<p>words, like a developer wouldn&rsquo;t have to use this chat interface</p>
<p>to get access to the large language model, you could just</p>
<p>submit your request through the API. And so give an example of</p>
<p>what of like a popular app and how they might use it. Yeah. So</p>
<p>so I think like notion actually had a demo that they published</p>
<p>where it was a pretty incredible demo, maybe we can find it and</p>
<p>it would do things they added actions in the demo, like</p>
<p>generate a task list. So you could take like a document or a</p>
<p>meeting summary, and would spit out recommendations for next</p>
<p>steps or tasks, it could, you know, spit out a table. Basically,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the autocomplete for everything that we talked about,</p>
<p>right. So now notion doesn&rsquo;t need to build their own LLM</p>
<p>expertise, they just built use the API.</p>
<p>So when the notion app, you say, Hey, I&rsquo;m building a marketing</p>
<p>plan. And you say, Well, okay, give me a list of things that</p>
<p>should be on my marketing plan for my new app. It sends a</p>
<p>signal to the chat GPT API, which will be on Azure</p>
<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s platform. And then it gives you the data back, you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to build the language model. Yeah, incredibly</p>
<p>powerful notion has all the content that they need, but</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have the AI expertise. So now they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to generate your or create AI expertise in house, they just</p>
<p>use the API. I was really powerful. And but just to finish</p>
<p>the thought here, I think that one of the things that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably misleading about these stats around funding and the</p>
<p>data, there&rsquo;s like almost 600 startups already, there are AI</p>
<p>startups, is that, you know, what happens when there&rsquo;s a new</p>
<p>wave is that founders are smart, right? And they know how to</p>
<p>market themselves in the way that is most compelling to VCs.</p>
<p>And they know that like VCs, frankly, are a little bit</p>
<p>lemming, like in terms of their migration to the next wave and</p>
<p>wanting to glom on to the next big wave. So VCs are now looking</p>
<p>for AI. If you&rsquo;re a founder, and you&rsquo;re you build one feature on</p>
<p>top of the, you know, open AI, API, now, all of a sudden,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to market yourself as a company, you&rsquo;re not gonna</p>
<p>market yourself as just a SaaS company. And so that&rsquo;s valid.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it could be aimed, or it could be like a</p>
<p>great pivot, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah. And it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not totally one or the other. I</p>
<p>mean, it&rsquo;s just that if you have a plausible connection to AI,</p>
<p>as a founder, you&rsquo;re going to start marketing yourself as an</p>
<p>AI company. And so that&rsquo;s how all of a sudden, you can have</p>
<p>600 of these companies, you know, that are all of a sudden</p>
<p>out there in the wake of this sort of chat GPT is I think a</p>
<p>lot of companies are recategorizing themselves.</p>
<p>I literally had this experience not three weeks ago, right</p>
<p>before I went to Japan, serial founder and team that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>backed for that had an exit, said, Can I show you something?</p>
<p>I said, Yeah, got on the zoom showed me a little proof of</p>
<p>concept using chat GPT. And he said, This is my idea. This is</p>
<p>the vertical. And I just said, Okay, what do you want? He said</p>
<p>500k for 10%. I said, Okay, done. Great, let&rsquo;s learn. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an easy bet for us to make because we know it&rsquo;s a serial</p>
<p>team.</p>
<p>For open AI, the way that it could become a trillion dollar</p>
<p>company is actually by cutting the cost to such a low degree</p>
<p>that nobody else can effectively compete with it. And then at</p>
<p>that point, they can become a small, small, small tax, you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>rather just pay it than try to compete with it. And I think for</p>
<p>open AI, that&rsquo;s actually a very brilliant strategy. So that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how they, they could get to become very, very large</p>
<p>evaluation would be to become so pervasively relied upon, and</p>
<p>where they take such a minuscule take rate of their</p>
<p>participation in you building a company that could be really</p>
<p>effective for them like cloud computing, right? Like we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to just take such a small tax. Yeah, that&rsquo;s not a small</p>
<p>tax. That&rsquo;s a large tax.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the picks and shovels play in a way to create the</p>
<p>developer ecosystem for AI. And to your point, I mean, I think</p>
<p>you raise a good point that you know, what was their motivation</p>
<p>to take such a dilutive round, you know, the 10 billion that</p>
<p>was evaluation at 3030. Yeah. And does that imply that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not confident? I mean, that the flip side of it could be maybe</p>
<p>they know, they want to compete on the basis of rapidly, you</p>
<p>know, becoming the developer platform. And so they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to subsidize that developer platform, you know, with</p>
<p>negative gross margins for some period of time. And maybe</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why they need a lot of capital.</p>
<p>And they were in kind of a reflexive loop of just cost of</p>
<p>getting better versus the amount of money they had to get</p>
<p>better. And so maybe they were forced to do it. And then in</p>
<p>that point, how would you justify you would say, well, the</p>
<p>other 50% is still hugely valuable. So that&rsquo;s enough for</p>
<p>us. And I think that that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s very logical as well.</p>
<p>Brad, you have your finger on the pulse of LPS, limited</p>
<p>partners who back funds like Chamath sacks is mine and yours.</p>
<p>We heard 6.5% on your money for no risk. Well, you in Chamath</p>
<p>position is hey, you have to triple that if you want to be a</p>
<p>private market investor. That&rsquo;s about 20% 20% rule of 72. That</p>
<p>means every three and a half years, you got to double. If</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing that for a 10 year fund, you&rsquo;re looking at a five</p>
<p>x fund is kind of table stakes, then I think just back of the</p>
<p>envelope math. What are LPS thinking right now? Are they</p>
<p>looking at this world and saying I should just be all in cash?</p>
<p>Are they saying, yeah, everybody thinks we should be all be in</p>
<p>cash. Therefore, there&rsquo;s not going to be enough money in</p>
<p>private. Therefore, there&rsquo;s an opportunity there. We know the</p>
<p>6.5% rate. You know, that&rsquo;s not going to be here forever. It may</p>
<p>be here for a little while, but we need to we need to keep</p>
<p>investing in venture. Or are they just cutthroat about it?</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s pause venture investing private market</p>
<p>investing? It&rsquo;s a great question. First, when I look at</p>
<p>the three year Treasury bill, it&rsquo;s like 4.7. Not to quibble</p>
<p>here. So I think Chamath&rsquo;s getting a little goosy, goosy on</p>
<p>this 6.5. But the fact of the matter is these goosy, goosy</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re super special. You&rsquo;re VIP JP.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s like some sort of like bond rate that included</p>
<p>corporates or something. Maybe it was 5.2 from Robin Hood on my</p>
<p>Robin Hood account for J trading. So it&rsquo;s what is in</p>
<p>that what is in that Jason, they probably got some junk bonds</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re ripping you off. Whatever it is, I&rsquo;m getting five</p>
<p>points. It&rsquo;s so you are until you&rsquo;re not you are until you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not. It&rsquo;s 100% T bill, parentheses and jump on funds.</p>
<p>Look at the fine print, Jacob. LPS have a 10 year view. They</p>
<p>understand like most people. I mean, listen, if you look out at</p>
<p>the 10 year, the reason the 10 year is, you know that we have</p>
<p>real interest rates at about one and a half percent. So that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the 10 year less expect expected inflation. When you look out is</p>
<p>because people expect inflation to come down and they expect</p>
<p>rates to come down. So if you were an LP and you said I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to invest in venture and the next two vintages, which may</p>
<p>be the best two vintages we&rsquo;ve seen in a long time because</p>
<p>prices are adjusting, etc. And I&rsquo;m going to move it all into</p>
<p>some rate bet. First, it&rsquo;s just very difficult to do they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>move their allocations around that quickly. Now a wealthy</p>
<p>family as an LP could move their allocations around really</p>
<p>quickly. But if you&rsquo;re Texas or your Ohio, or you&rsquo;re a sovereign</p>
<p>wealth fund, you&rsquo;re betting on the arc of value creation. I</p>
<p>would say this, the consequence is they&rsquo;re narrowing their</p>
<p>aperture as to the venture funds they want to allocate capital</p>
<p>Okay, explain that unpack who they are narrowing the aperture</p>
<p>to. We&rsquo;ve talked a lot on this pod about the power law. And the</p>
<p>truth of the matter is whether we&rsquo;re talking about AI or</p>
<p>software, or anything else that you know, people are going to be</p>
<p>funding, it&rsquo;s 10% of the investments that are going to</p>
<p>yield 90% of the returns. And so they&rsquo;re looking at that and</p>
<p>saying who are the top 10 firms in Silicon Valley, I either want</p>
<p>to get allocation to those firms who are seeing the best</p>
<p>deals converting the best deals and are selective, like sacks</p>
<p>talked about, or we just don&rsquo;t want to allocate. So I think,</p>
<p>you know, what we saw over the last two years, Jason was an</p>
<p>explosion of new funds, an explosion of new, you know,</p>
<p>first time second time funds, I think subscale small funds with</p>
<p>no DPI, they&rsquo;re going to find a really, really tough time to</p>
<p>point about DPI raising capital, okay to see the scale player</p>
<p>scale. So part of that is clearing out the inventory from</p>
<p>the last cycle, two news stories this week about companies, you</p>
<p>know, maybe struggling, Sequoia got off the board of citizen, if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know citizen, that&rsquo;s that app that tells you where</p>
<p>crimes are happening in your city, very popular in San</p>
<p>Francisco, it&rsquo;s literally goes off every 90 seconds, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty dystopian. That company citizen, which is a pretty cool</p>
<p>app, has raised 130 million to date, Sequoia led the series a</p>
<p>in 2017. They did a pay to play round, if you don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>that is. Basically, if you don&rsquo;t invest, you get crammed down,</p>
<p>how does the cram down work? Well, your shares in the company</p>
<p>went down 10 to one, and you probably got moved to common</p>
<p>shares as opposed to as opposed to preferred, which has a series</p>
<p>of protections, they get their money out first, yada, yada. But</p>
<p>Sequoia refused to participate. According to this FT story,</p>
<p>again, Sequoia did not comment on this, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>something you don&rsquo;t do as a VC, when something goes bad at a</p>
<p>company, and you leave the board, you generally don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to say bad things or taint the company any more than leaving</p>
<p>the board does. So a bunch of cram downs happening. And then</p>
<p>dovetailing with that Instacart, according to the Wall Street</p>
<p>Journal had a big q4 as it prepares to go public. Instacart,</p>
<p>if you remember, we talked about it on the show cut its internal</p>
<p>valuation 75% last year from 39 billion to 10 billion. According</p>
<p>to sources, Instacart q4 results, according to the Wall</p>
<p>Street Journal, up more than 50%, even though order volume</p>
<p>grew only 16%. Why they turned advertising on the app, just like</p>
<p>Uber and Amazon, a lot of these commerce folks, folks are</p>
<p>building ad business inside of theirs. So what do you think</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s happening as we clear out this private? Anybody</p>
<p>have thoughts on Instacart or the cram down rounds? Go either</p>
<p>way with this, and then we&rsquo;ll go to</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t focus too much on those two companies, I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to see in the second half of 23. And all of 24 is a</p>
<p>lot of medicine being taken a lot of down rounds, a lot of</p>
<p>structure is going to be a tale of two cities, the hot area, you</p>
<p>know, AI is going to continue to receive new investment. And all</p>
<p>these companies that, you know, that receive peak valuations in</p>
<p>2021, are going to have a day of reckoning, either, you know,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re lucky, maybe they have a flat round or model</p>
<p>modestly up around, but a lot of them are going to have down</p>
<p>rounds or restructurings. And this is going to be going on for</p>
<p>the next year and a half.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your philosophy sax on leaving a board? This is a</p>
<p>really dicey issue when you give up on a company. What&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>practice there? How do you do it without damaging the company?</p>
<p>Obviously, the founder relationships can be hard. What</p>
<p>have you learned about this as a private market investor?</p>
<p>Well, I think, I think that sometimes we like flip board</p>
<p>members internally at craft is because people have different</p>
<p>amounts of capacity. That&rsquo;s not a statement at all about the way</p>
<p>craft feels about the company. It&rsquo;s just a reflection of our</p>
<p>individual bandwidths, or whose expertise are needed at a time.</p>
<p>But when the firm itself quits a board, I think there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>to read that other than, you know, a statement of protest.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what happened with that company. But it seems</p>
<p>to me that, you know, again, it could be a sign that the venture</p>
<p>firm isn&rsquo;t happy with the way that they&rsquo;re being treated.</p>
<p>The cram down, Chama. That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s a bitter pill to swallow.</p>
<p>Why would founders do this cram down instead of just adding a</p>
<p>little more to the top? And is there a way to do this without,</p>
<p>you know, going scorched earth or poisoning the well as it</p>
<p>were, we, I mean, again, putting this app and Sequoia aside,</p>
<p>this is happening all over the ecosystem. So is there a way to</p>
<p>do this gracefully? Or is it just going to be messy?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be really messy. I mean, to state the</p>
<p>obvious, no, no venture capital investor ever quits the board</p>
<p>voluntarily of a great company that&rsquo;s doing well, that would be</p>
<p>dumb. So as David said, sort of like the proof is in the</p>
<p>pudding there. And at the same time, there are a lot of</p>
<p>companies who don&rsquo;t want to see the writing on the wall. And</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll do all kinds of gymnastics to try to stick a landing on a</p>
<p>contorted financing. And sometimes those things have real</p>
<p>consequences to other investors who just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>right thing to do. I wouldn&rsquo;t read too much into this except</p>
<p>that good founders have a responsibility to do what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right for themselves and their employees, nobody else. And the</p>
<p>thing to keep in mind investors really, no, I think you I think</p>
<p>you absolutely have to prioritize the people doing the</p>
<p>actual work. And if and if you actually did prioritize them,</p>
<p>what you would probably say to yourself is, Oh, my gosh, there</p>
<p>are people who I work with, who I look in the eye every day,</p>
<p>because investors, you&rsquo;ll see once a quarter. But I have my</p>
<p>fellow employees that as a founder that I look in the eyes</p>
<p>every day, who&rsquo;ve been toiling with me for umpteen hours a day</p>
<p>every day for years. And they are now totally underwater. What</p>
<p>is the right thing to do for them? And I think if you just</p>
<p>answer that question, you wouldn&rsquo;t do all these contorted</p>
<p>things, you would just reset the valuation, you would refresh</p>
<p>the equity pool, you would issue options back out to those</p>
<p>employees, and you would move on. It&rsquo;s all these other things</p>
<p>that get in the way of answering that simple, simple</p>
<p>question, where people fuck it up.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve done that before.</p>
<p>Exactly. If you don&rsquo;t have a team, and you don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>motivated team, you have nothing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done that before. I don&rsquo;t want to rehash one of my more</p>
<p>miserable experiences. But I was dealing with a company that had</p>
<p>a grossly inflated valuation, it was a total problem case. We</p>
<p>voluntarily slashed the valuation in half and reissued</p>
<p>options to the employees to keep them motivated. No big deal.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s no big deal, but it requires some amount of</p>
<p>fortitude. And like, you know, understanding your priorities, I</p>
<p>guess.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re about to what do you think, you know, like, first, I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s revealing that we think what happened here is so</p>
<p>out of the ordinary. I mean, you flashback to 2001 to 2004.</p>
<p>Sequoia, I don&rsquo;t think funded a single loser in their portfolio.</p>
<p>Right? Like, that&rsquo;s a time where you walked away from the ones</p>
<p>that weren&rsquo;t winning. And you fed the ones that were, because</p>
<p>you have limited capital, and you don&rsquo;t know when you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to raise your next capital, this idea that you have unlimited</p>
<p>capital, you can give money to anybody, no matter what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing with respect to their plan, I think is a function of</p>
<p>the last 10 years. But to Tomas points, the idea of tough talk,</p>
<p>you know, either out of CEOs or out of board members has been in</p>
<p>short supply in Silicon Valley, this idea that saying the truth</p>
<p>just speaking the words about needing to get fit or needing to</p>
<p>lower the valuation, that somehow that is founder unfriendly</p>
<p>is nonsensical. The truth is founder friendly, by definition,</p>
<p>and I think to Tomas point, the less complicated you make this,</p>
<p>right, you reset the valuation, you re up the option pool, and</p>
<p>then everybody has a choice to make. And if the people who are</p>
<p>on the board and backing the company choose not to re up for</p>
<p>whatever reason, they no longer believe in the path forward for</p>
<p>the company that&rsquo;s incumbent upon the founder to go find</p>
<p>people who will.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not abandonment as it&rsquo;s being framed in this story. It</p>
<p>is a trade. And I think maybe if you look at public market</p>
<p>investors, Brad, nobody gets upset by a trade trade to trade.</p>
<p>But in the private markets, there&rsquo;s a lot more emotion</p>
<p>involved a lot more relationship material. And this founder</p>
<p>friendly concept of like, you&rsquo;re abandoning me. It&rsquo;s like, no,</p>
<p>the the trade here, it makes no sense for this firm and for this</p>
<p>fund. And for these LPS, right, you</p>
<p>know, sometimes, sometimes the founder needs to have the</p>
<p>courage to look in the mirror and say, what I&rsquo;m doing is not</p>
<p>working. I had a plan, I missed the plan by 70%. I&rsquo;m lighting</p>
<p>capital on fire. This is a charity, not a business. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>best to say it didn&rsquo;t work, shut it down and move on and do</p>
<p>something else.</p>
<p>Okay, so of course, you&rsquo;re referencing Salesforce. So we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>pivot to that. It&rsquo;s not that bad. But I think this is a good</p>
<p>time to maybe talk about the public markets and inflation and</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re seeing in macro. So</p>
<p>can I set up a question for Brad, actually?</p>
<p>Sure, go ahead. Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah. So so on a previous podcast, I laid out my theory of</p>
<p>how you could just use the two year bond rate relative to the</p>
<p>Fed funds rate to understand where the bond markets sort of</p>
<p>prediction market about inflation is going. And a month</p>
<p>ago, the two year bond rate was at 4.1%, relative to</p>
<p>4.5% Fed funds rates. In other words, the bond market was</p>
<p>betting that interest rates will go down between now and two</p>
<p>years from now, relative to where the Fed had it. So</p>
<p>therefore, it believed that inflation had been conquered.</p>
<p>Now, fast forward just one month later, and the two year bond</p>
<p>rates at about 4.9%. You know, the Fed funds rates about four</p>
<p>and a half percent. That is a massive swing, basically 80</p>
<p>basis point swing in the I guess the two year bond rate.</p>
<p>And so the market seemed to be saying all of a sudden, not just</p>
<p>that they expect rates to be higher longer, but also that the</p>
<p>Fed needs to keep raising. And that is a big change. So Brad,</p>
<p>what is the basis for that? And what do we now believe about</p>
<p>inflation? I think just a few weeks ago, we were thinking that</p>
<p>this problem was licked and the market took off like a rocket,</p>
<p>it ripped. Now all of a sudden, it seems like investors are</p>
<p>really worried that inflation is not over. So where does this</p>
<p>stand right now? Well, I think when we started the year, you</p>
<p>know, the the 10 year was close to three to an hour closer to</p>
<p>4%. The 10 minus two is as negative as it&rsquo;s been in the</p>
<p>last, probably 10 years. So the market is clearly saying, you</p>
<p>know, we saw some inflation prints that came in hotter. I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s now consensus, which you guys have been saying on the</p>
<p>pod, that, you know, although the second derivative is slowing</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s sticky, right, we&rsquo;re going to get stuck at this four,</p>
<p>four and a half, three and a half. And it&rsquo;s the slope of the</p>
<p>curve downward is going to be slower. We&rsquo;ve gone from thinking</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have 225 to now thinking we&rsquo;ll have three or</p>
<p>four. You know, and so I think everybody is now bracing for</p>
<p>more inflation. But remember, when we started the year on</p>
<p>January 1, the consensus wisdom was we were going to retest the</p>
<p>S&amp;P at 3200, we&rsquo;re going to have an earnings recession, and</p>
<p>that inflation was going to continue to run hotter. The only</p>
<p>surprise in my mind so far this year, is how well the equity</p>
<p>markets have held up in the face of a 10 year that&rsquo;s gone</p>
<p>parabolic, right? And an actual earnings recession, right? And</p>
<p>you you know, you you posted, you know, in our thread, Chamath</p>
<p>about just quality of earnings, you know, even the earnings</p>
<p>beats are pretty low quality. And so I think, you know, we now</p>
<p>are going to have a couple inflation prints coming up over</p>
<p>the course of the next couple weeks that are going to be</p>
<p>important. My hunch is, you know, everybody has tilted again</p>
<p>on, you know, what we saw in the last couple prints, my</p>
<p>suspicion, if you look at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, the</p>
<p>consensus view is that we&rsquo;re still heading in the direction</p>
<p>of 4% faster than I think people emotionally think. So I would</p>
<p>say there&rsquo;s maximum uncertainty in the world. The fear that in</p>
<p>inflation is uncapped the way Larry Summers was articulate in</p>
<p>November and December is less today than it was. But what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>emerged is this idea that we&rsquo;re going to have higher rates for</p>
<p>longer, and we&rsquo;re going to have higher inflation for longer. Now,</p>
<p>the question I throw back at you is, the market abhors</p>
<p>uncertainty. The market&rsquo;s done totally fine during periods</p>
<p>where we had 3% inflation and five and a half percent rates,</p>
<p>right? When with the internet boom, that was, you know, 2000</p>
<p>to 2005 rates were a hell of a lot higher than the rates are</p>
<p>today. So I don&rsquo;t think that higher rates and higher</p>
<p>inflation means that we can&rsquo;t, you know, invest in venture</p>
<p>backed companies that have huge secular growth, the world</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t end. But what I do think it means is like, if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s massive uncertainty in the world, if allocators of</p>
<p>capital don&rsquo;t know whether rates are going to double again,</p>
<p>whether inflation is going to double again, then everything</p>
<p>just shuts down. And that&rsquo;s really bad for the economy. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t see that happening right now. But I do think that the</p>
<p>prints over the course of the next eight weeks are going to</p>
<p>be important.</p>
<p>Chamath, you have any macro thoughts here? At the same time</p>
<p>this is happening, we saw rents broke in the last month. So</p>
<p>rents got cheaper. Yeah. A governing principle, I think I</p>
<p>probably said it too many times, but I&rsquo;ll say it again, rates</p>
<p>are going to be higher than we like, and they&rsquo;ll stay here</p>
<p>longer than we want. So if you use that as a principle,</p>
<p>whenever the consensus thinks we&rsquo;re done, it&rsquo;s been pretty</p>
<p>profitable to be on the other side of consensus. And so I</p>
<p>still kind of maintain that we&rsquo;re probably going to have a</p>
<p>five and a half percent fed funds rate. Which means that I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know, maybe credit suites will offer me seven and a half</p>
<p>percent soon on three month T-bills, but we&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>higher rates. And I do think Brad&rsquo;s right, though, in the</p>
<p>sense that as long as we know that then that&rsquo;s it, and we can</p>
<p>forecast it into the future without it changing too much,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be okay. But right now, what you&rsquo;re seeing is a lot of</p>
<p>make believe going on in in the stock market. So Nick, if you</p>
<p>want to just throw up that image. So this is a really</p>
<p>this is the chart of cash flow versus earnings. Yeah. So this</p>
<p>is something that I saw in Bloomberg, which I thought was</p>
<p>really interesting. And if you focus on the period of 2020 to</p>
<p>2024, what you see is the white line, which is net income</p>
<p>adjusted for depreciation amortization. And the blue line</p>
<p>is cash flows from operations. So what does that mean?</p>
<p>And this is for S&amp;P 500 firms,</p>
<p>this is the best 500 companies in the world. Yeah. And the</p>
<p>white line is what you tell Wall Street in terms of what you</p>
<p>make on paper. The blue line is what actually appears in the</p>
<p>bank account. So why could there be a gap between what you</p>
<p>tell somebody you made, I made $1 versus what&rsquo;s in the bank,</p>
<p>50 cents? Well, the reason is that there&rsquo;s all kinds of</p>
<p>accounting tricks that you can use accruals, inventories, and</p>
<p>all of these things allow you to present a healthier earnings</p>
<p>report than is actually true. And so right now, we have the</p>
<p>worst earning situation. So the worst gap between what we are</p>
<p>telling people versus what is actually in the bank account</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve had for 30 years since 1990. And so it just</p>
<p>brings into focus the fact that we may be in the last few</p>
<p>innings of trying to make sure this all looks okay. In which</p>
<p>case, one faction of the investing world who thinks that</p>
<p>this earnings recession is actually at hand would be kind</p>
<p>of right. And then what they would say is that once we all</p>
<p>realize that these earnings are fake, and you reset down 15%,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where you get to the mid 3000. In the S&amp;P 500. Right now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s around 4000. I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true or not. But</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more and more evidence that would support that the way</p>
<p>that they see the world could be credible. The other side</p>
<p>says, Hey, listen, this is a bump in the road. We&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>a handle on things. And it&rsquo;s stabilizing. So even though</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s higher than we&rsquo;d like, it&rsquo;s not going to change that</p>
<p>much. So now just think about 1015 years from now. And let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go. And those are the folks that want to rip the money into</p>
<p>growth stocks and tech stocks again.</p>
<p>How does the consumer play into all this record low</p>
<p>unemployment, like it&rsquo;s 1% in Utah, three and a half percent</p>
<p>for the country, two and a half jobs for every American who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unemployed. And then these rents coming down. But</p>
<p>consumers have seemed to have burned off all that extra money</p>
<p>they had. So Brad, when you look at the consumer driven economy</p>
<p>that the world lives in,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not true. Because you have to understand, stimulus is</p>
<p>still entering the economy, it&rsquo;s just harder to measure. So for</p>
<p>example, take Social Security, you have cost of living</p>
<p>adjustments in Social Security, that&rsquo;s lifting payments by 10</p>
<p>and 15%. Because it&rsquo;s backdated for what was going on last year.</p>
<p>And remember, last year, we had two, three, four, 5% inflation</p>
<p>rates. So there is more and more money coming into people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pockets that we don&rsquo;t realize. And we&rsquo;re all on the hook for</p>
<p>that as US taxpayers. So I think it&rsquo;s very dangerous to kind of</p>
<p>look at one data point and try to pick off what&rsquo;s happening in</p>
<p>consumer land. Because there&rsquo;s all kinds of hidden ways in</p>
<p>which money gets back to people.</p>
<p>Brad, you have thoughts on the consumer because, you know, I</p>
<p>test, it does seem like consumers are still spending</p>
<p>money. But the cost of goods in some cases is coming down. I</p>
<p>mean, how do you look at the consumer and try to make sense</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s going on here? Because it does seem the United States</p>
<p>is in its own little bubble here world of just over employment.</p>
<p>Still, even though we&rsquo;re seeing these layoffs in 10.</p>
<p>I would say number one, that the pop we&rsquo;ve seen in rates,</p>
<p>which impacts consumers by way of higher mortgages, higher</p>
<p>variable expenses on their credit cards was offset over the</p>
<p>last few months by lower energy costs. So their cost of</p>
<p>gasoline went down. Add in the things that Chamath is talking</p>
<p>about, and I&rsquo;m not sure you took a lot of money out of people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pockets. I would say this that again, what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>here, retail sales have continued to do really well.</p>
<p>ecommerce sales in January were quite strong. That would all be</p>
<p>consistent with this off landing. But here we are, you</p>
<p>know, again, talking about macro, I think when you spend</p>
<p>this much time talking about macro doing what we do, you</p>
<p>know, like last year, I&rsquo;ll be the first to raise my hand and</p>
<p>say, you know, like our friend Bill Gurley would say it leads</p>
<p>you in the wrong direction. The fact of the matter is, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>totally unknown and unknowable where we&rsquo;re going to go over the</p>
<p>course of the next three or four months. I think there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>better ability to predict maybe over the course of the next</p>
<p>couple years. But the fact is, if you would have told any I was</p>
<p>just with a bunch of investors, you probably represent a trillion</p>
<p>dollars of public market demand 10 or so long only investors,</p>
<p>if you would have told any of them that the 10 year was going</p>
<p>to be at 396, they would have told you that the NASDAQ would</p>
<p>be down 10% to start the year, and it did just the opposite. So</p>
<p>I think you got it, you know, you&rsquo;re, you have a bunch better</p>
<p>chance, particularly if you&rsquo;re playing at home, right, than</p>
<p>trying to guess the direction of that find five companies that</p>
<p>you think are going to grow and earn more money, irrespective</p>
<p>of the direction of rates and inflation, own those and enjoy</p>
<p>your life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at the world and going sacks, my Lord, I&rsquo;m seeing</p>
<p>great founders, great companies, and five to $10 million valuations</p>
<p>and I can buy 510 15% of these companies. This feels like the</p>
<p>best it&rsquo;s been for me as an angel investor, seed investor</p>
<p>seed fund for a long time. This is fantastic. Great deal flow.</p>
<p>The deals are taking six weeks to close. We&rsquo;re having very</p>
<p>thoughtful discussions. People are taking a real focused</p>
<p>approach to how they deploy the capital. It is not YOLO, people</p>
<p>are building models, again, people are showing their CAC,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re being thoughtful about how they spend the money. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>being thoughtful about salaries and hiring. So what what&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>you seem to think that, you know, what we&rsquo;re seeing here is</p>
<p>challenging or a problem? What are your thoughts on how it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>affecting your day to day business as somebody who is a</p>
<p>company builder?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s separate two things. So there&rsquo;s the tech ecosystem,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s the economy as a whole. The fact of the matter is</p>
<p>that tech already had its bubble in 2021. It had its crash in</p>
<ol start="2022">
<li>And now we&rsquo;re largely on the other side of that. There&rsquo;s</li>
</ol>
<p>still a lot of companies like we talked about, they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>need to restructure, who raised during the bubble and may not</p>
<p>have come to grips with that. But if you&rsquo;re talking about new</p>
<p>investment, new rounds, new companies are starting with a</p>
<p>clean sheet of paper and a blank slate, you&rsquo;re right, things</p>
<p>seem good and normal, right? People are making intelligent</p>
<p>investments. And obviously, the innovation cycle doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>anything to do with the macro picture. I mean, technology</p>
<p>wants to evolve, and it&rsquo;s great engineers and product people who</p>
<p>drive those ideas forward. And they&rsquo;re not thinking about</p>
<p>interest rates. I never thought about the Fed funds rate at all</p>
<p>when I was a founder running companies. So let&rsquo;s just put</p>
<p>that aside and acknowledge that great, this great innovation is</p>
<p>going to keep happening, no matter what the macroeconomic</p>
<p>picture looks like. That being said, I mean, just for the</p>
<p>listeners of the show aren&rsquo;t startup founders, I tend to be a</p>
<p>little bit gloomy about the macro picture right now. Because</p>
<p>yeah, it&rsquo;s true that what Brad said that we&rsquo;ve had good</p>
<p>economies with 5% rates before. But I think you also have to</p>
<p>look at the pace of change or the rate at which the the Fed</p>
<p>funds rate has been going up. And if you look at the chart of</p>
<p>rate increases, it is a very steep chart of rate increases.</p>
<p>And I just think that for the last decade or so, we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>operating in this like zero interest rate or ZURP</p>
<p>environment with loss of monetary stimulus. And I think</p>
<p>a lot of companies, a lot of parts of the economy got</p>
<p>addicted to that stimulus, they got hooked on drugs. Now, all</p>
<p>of a sudden, you&rsquo;re putting them through withdrawal very, very</p>
<p>quickly. And obviously, the withdrawal pangs are going to</p>
<p>be worse, if you can&rsquo;t taper off slowly. So, it looked like</p>
<p>just a few weeks ago that the Fed was done raising rates. Now</p>
<p>we know that they&rsquo;re not, we don&rsquo;t really know when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to stop. So, I tend to be a little bit gloomy with</p>
<p>respect to the big macro picture, because I just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see how you can change rates this fast. And I mean, you look</p>
<p>at like real estate, for example, we just saw the first</p>
<p>year over year decrease in the housing market in a while. And</p>
<p>again, that&rsquo;s all driven by rates, the cost of mortgages</p>
<p>going up, and two big defaults in the first two big defaults.</p>
<p>Yeah. So, I think that there&rsquo;s going to be some pain ahead.</p>
<p>Now, you know, ironically, from the standpoint of the tech</p>
<p>ecosystem, we may have already taken our medicine. And we may</p>
<p>already be on the other side.</p>
<p>Actually, that is a good way to to look at as we took the</p>
<p>medicine, it&rsquo;s painful.</p>
<p>And Jason, maybe maybe that&rsquo;s the segue to talking about</p>
<p>Benioff, I would say we haven&rsquo;t took it, we&rsquo;re taking it, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>starting to take our medicine.</p>
<p>Well, it makes sense that Benioff, with his, you know,</p>
<p>very loving family kind of approach to running the company</p>
<p>might actually, it might take him a little while to become a</p>
<p>big cutthroat. So as everybody knows, Benioff, and Salesforce</p>
<p>have had a lot of turnover, a lot of senior executives have</p>
<p>left voluntary or involuntary. But shares were up 11%. On</p>
<p>Thursday, after reporting their Q4 earnings, they&rsquo;re up 14% year</p>
<p>over year, small net loss, but the company bought back $2.3</p>
<p>billion worth of its stock, we&rsquo;re going to see more of that</p>
<p>for sure. And they&rsquo;re going to be increasing its share buy back</p>
<p>program to $20 billion going forward. And like meta, which</p>
<p>suddenly got fit and got religion. Benioff is now</p>
<p>basically with all these activists, I guess on on his ass,</p>
<p>he says, in this is the quote from the earnings call, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>more closely scrutinizing every dollar of investment and</p>
<p>resource and very focused on driving operational excellence</p>
<p>and automation across our business focusing on four key</p>
<p>errors, short, long term expense, restructuring employee</p>
<p>productivity, there it is. product innovation and building</p>
<p>relationships with shareholders. profitability is our truly our</p>
<p>number one strategy. And that&rsquo;s my number one strategy. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the number one thing we talked about at the start of every</p>
<p>meeting we have in this company, quite a turnaround your</p>
<p>thoughts, Brad,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the story is that, you know, that Benioff, you</p>
<p>know, made these cuts, and that activists are around the rim,</p>
<p>what was significant was his comments that he made, and I</p>
<p>tweeted about it today, you know, he said, every CEO in</p>
<p>Silicon Valley has looked at what Elon Musk has done, and</p>
<p>asked themselves, do they need to unleash their own Elon within</p>
<p>them? And, you know, listen, we&rsquo;ve been talking about this</p>
<p>for nine months. The reality is, if you look at the employee</p>
<p>count at Salesforce, in 2015, they had 19,000 employees. As of</p>
<p>last year, they had 80,000. In seven years, they four x, the</p>
<p>number of employees, they were a mature company. By 2015, their</p>
<p>employees cagored at 23%. You know, we don&rsquo;t talk about it in</p>
<p>this way. But these large companies, these employee bases,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not unions, but they may as well be.</p>
<p>Right? Why would that be?</p>
<p>I just think there&rsquo;s, there is, during this age of excess, where</p>
<p>it was just easy for people to hire more people and build more</p>
<p>things not to make tough choices, etc. Right? We just had</p>
<p>an explosion like we&rsquo;ve never seen in Silicon Valley, in the</p>
<p>number of employees in these businesses, meta went from 10,000</p>
<p>to 80,000 85,000, Google went to 185,000. And at those levels,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to govern them. And when the CEOs went to</p>
<p>make decisions in the businesses, there would be</p>
<p>protests, revolts, within the business, 30 or 40,000 people</p>
<p>would sign a petition even say, No, we&rsquo;re not going back to the</p>
<p>office. No, we&rsquo;re not going to work three days a week. No, you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t name our AI bot, what you want to name it because it</p>
<p>offends us. And so to me, what&rsquo;s more significant is over the</p>
<p>last six months, we&rsquo;ve seen courage, gain momentum in</p>
<p>Silicon Valley. Right? What&rsquo;s deeply underappreciated about</p>
<p>meta, and the changes they made, it would be one thing if it was</p>
<p>just window dressing, we cut 10% of the workforce kind of</p>
<p>tighten our belt a little bit. But Zuckerberg got on his call,</p>
<p>and he said, we only have two priorities in 2023. One is</p>
<p>efficiency, and he went into depth about once they started</p>
<p>cutting people, how the company got faster, the product release</p>
<p>cycle sped up, the employees got happier. And now it&rsquo;s an end in</p>
<p>itself to delay or the business. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re hearing out</p>
<p>of Benioff as well. And I think it&rsquo;s, you know, people can</p>
<p>quibble with how Elon went about the change, which you and you</p>
<p>and David are very familiar with at Twitter. But the reality is,</p>
<p>he lit a fuse in Silicon Valley that is giving courage, whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s private companies, series B companies, pre IPO companies,</p>
<p>public companies, I&rsquo;ve had that conversation more times than you</p>
<p>can imagine over the course of the last six months. And I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really important change, because I think it breathes new</p>
<p>productivity into all these businesses. And importantly, it</p>
<p>unleashes these engineers back into the ecosystem to start the</p>
<p>next wave of companies.</p>
<p>Yeah. So Jason, I mean, you and I got to tag along with Elon</p>
<p>during that transition phase at Twitter. And the thing that I</p>
<p>took away from it was just how much agency, you know, CEOs have</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not using. I mean, Elon went in there, and he</p>
<p>basically changed whatever he saw that he didn&rsquo;t like, I mean,</p>
<p>unsentimentally and quickly. And, you know, and so you look</p>
<p>at all these other companies, you talk to CEO sometimes, and</p>
<p>they act like they&rsquo;re prisoners of their companies, like, I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>change this, I can&rsquo;t change syndrome. Yeah, yeah, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;ve got all these employees and all these layers.</p>
<p>And but I can&rsquo;t, you know, there&rsquo;s always some reason I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>afraid of the bad PR, or, you know, whatever it is. And I, you</p>
<p>know, the thing I came away, realizing is just how much</p>
<p>agency, particularly founder CEOs have, that they just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>use, you know, they&rsquo;re always like hemming and hawing and</p>
<p>wringing their hands, and acting like they&rsquo;re tied down</p>
<p>by this or that. And the reality is, they can do whatever they</p>
<p>want, just about, you know, within the bounds of what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s legal. And, and I think they&rsquo;re starting to realize, oh,</p>
<p>wait a second, like, I actually can do that. You know, I can</p>
<p>walk into my company one day. And if there&rsquo;s a team that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>performing, that&rsquo;s giving me answers that don&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense, I can start over. I&rsquo;m just gonna start over. Yeah,</p>
<p>reboot. I mean, if you can&rsquo;t get it done, then we need to have</p>
<p>somebody who can do it. And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s incredible. Like we</p>
<p>were doing an analysis on this week in startups of the, you</p>
<p>know, employees per company and the revenue per employee per</p>
<p>headcount. And I got roasted for having this calm even having</p>
<p>this conversation. And now here we are Chamath, people are</p>
<p>looking at efficiency, we&rsquo;re looking at, you know, really,</p>
<p>how efficient can these companies be run? Is there a</p>
<p>limit to where this is going? And if we were to look at this</p>
<p>as a process, where are the fangs, the Amazons, the</p>
<p>Googles, Facebook&rsquo;s, where are they at in terms of percentage</p>
<p>to being at Elon, if you if you were to put Twitter and Elon as</p>
<p>the goal, where are these companies? And I don&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>that is the goal. Maybe maybe he&rsquo;s cut too much. Who knows?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll find out. I think it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a pretty radical</p>
<p>experiment experiment he&rsquo;s doing there. Yeah,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a reasonable or an achievable goal</p>
<p>for a public company. Okay. I mean, I think the thing we have</p>
<p>to keep in mind is Elon is also capable of doing that because he</p>
<p>paid $44 billion of his own money to buy something that he</p>
<p>owns outright, that no longer has revenue pressure to outside</p>
<p>stakeholders, different circumstance revenue went down</p>
<p>70% at Twitter. Well, that only affects him and his ability to</p>
<p>pay whatever he borrowed in order to buy that company. And</p>
<p>as long as he&rsquo;s willing to fund that somehow, he&rsquo;s literally</p>
<p>allowed to do whatever he wants. That&rsquo;s no longer the case</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re borrowing money from other people to build your</p>
<p>business, which is what every other capital market</p>
<p>participant does, public market participant does and private</p>
<p>market participants. So I think that that distinction is just a</p>
<p>little bit important, because it probably means that there is a</p>
<p>shadow of what Elon is doing, that&rsquo;s probably the threshold of</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s possible. And it&rsquo;s probably, you know, sort of 50%</p>
<p>headcount reduction, that&rsquo;s probably the, the bound in which</p>
<p>things break. Because I think the thing to keep in mind is that</p>
<p>over time, this stuff is like collagen in the body, it just</p>
<p>like, it creates these interconnected webs of just very</p>
<p>difficult stuff that you sin you that you cannot tease apart</p>
<p>blockages. So even if you try to go in and cut 50% of a company</p>
<p>like Facebook or Google or Microsoft or Apple or Amazon, it</p>
<p>would be so difficult, because all of a sudden, the</p>
<p>coordination that happens at that scale, I think would get</p>
<p>lost. So I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s possible, you kind of have to do</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re doing, which is cut 5%, then cut 10%, then cut 5%,</p>
<p>then cut 5%. And I know it frustrates people on the outside</p>
<p>looking in, but I think it&rsquo;s the, it&rsquo;s probably the only way</p>
<p>it can be done without torpedoing the company.</p>
<p>What does that do on a culture basis, then, because that is the</p>
<p>big critique, hey, you&rsquo;re creating now this culture of</p>
<p>fear, I guess the opposite of that is you&rsquo;re creating a</p>
<p>culture of performance and expectation. So how do you think</p>
<p>about it on a culture basis, because that keeps coming up</p>
<p>from founders to David&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>it depends, because I think companies when they&rsquo;re smaller,</p>
<p>I mean, I can tell you, when I was a part of the Facebook</p>
<p>senior management team, we would rank all the employees.</p>
<p>So we had a very good sense of who was the best and the most</p>
<p>performant all the way down to who was not. And we were able to</p>
<p>do that, probably up to two or 3000 employees. That&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>possible at 50,000. And nor is it fair. So because you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know who these folks are, the real contributors are, you have</p>
<p>to do what Elon did, which is literally go person to person</p>
<p>and say, who is unbelievably performant, or critical? Yeah.</p>
<p>In the absence of doing that, you just don&rsquo;t know who to let</p>
<p>go. And so you have no choice except to bleed down. The</p>
<p>question that I have, and Brad, maybe there&rsquo;s a smart analyst on</p>
<p>your team that can do it is right. And it&rsquo;s more of a</p>
<p>statement as well. Can you imagine the totality of stock</p>
<p>based comp that&rsquo;s been given out by all these companies since</p>
<p>2015? When they were catering their employee bases by 25% a</p>
<p>year? I bet you it&rsquo;s a trillion and a half dollars at least. You</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s that you think it&rsquo;s in that order of magnitude?</p>
<p>100% This has been the greatest grift in the history of Silicon</p>
<p>Valley for sure.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s pause for a second. Can you explain what we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about here? Stock based compensation obviously is the</p>
<p>stock given to employees. It&rsquo;s generally not counted. Well,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s do the accounting, right? Let&rsquo;s do it this way.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say that you believe in capitalism. Okay. Yep. So if</p>
<p>you if you believe in capitalism, let&rsquo;s say the, the</p>
<p>four of us start a company, and there&rsquo;s $1 of profit, and we</p>
<p>each own 25% of the company. Got it. Normally, what you would</p>
<p>say is each of us get 25 cents. Right, reasonable, we own 25%</p>
<p>each, there&rsquo;s $1 profit, we each have 20. So that means that in</p>
<p>four years, right, we each will have made $1 because so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just say it costs $1 to get off the ground or $4 to get off the</p>
<p>ground, all in summit budget, we believe we all would have been</p>
<p>made whole, we all would feel great. And then now every year</p>
<p>afterwards, that 25 cents we get as profit. Now, let&rsquo;s say that,</p>
<p>Jason, you add a fifth person, and Brad and David and I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>say anything about it. Okay. And that fifth person now gets a</p>
<p>fifth of it. Right. And so now all of a sudden, our 25 cents</p>
<p>goes down to 20 cents. Then let&rsquo;s say you add five more</p>
<p>people now all of a sudden, our 25 cents went to 20. And then</p>
<p>it went to 10 cents. Yeah. And at some point, Brad and David</p>
<p>and I raise our hand and say, Hey, this is not the deal we</p>
<p>signed up for. And you say, well, too bad, because revenue</p>
<p>would not be what it is. And profits would not be what it is</p>
<p>without these extra six people. And that&rsquo;s effectively what</p>
<p>everybody debates when they own a stock, the shareholders want</p>
<p>that number to be as small as possible. And I think what Brad</p>
<p>is observing is that in Silicon Valley, what has happened is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been poor accountability for what all of those extra</p>
<p>people do. And profits haven&rsquo;t written risen fast enough to</p>
<p>make the existing three people on the cap table feel okay about</p>
<p>it. And that instead of talking about three people and six, and</p>
<p>$1, you&rsquo;re talking about trillions of dollars, and</p>
<p>hundreds of 1000s of extra shareholders, Brad, millions of</p>
<p>extra share. And now we have some charts here. So we can do</p>
<p>some fun with numbers. I think taking a step back, I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very important to realize that stock as a form of</p>
<p>compensation to create alignment, excitement in the</p>
<p>early stage of venture capital, is part of the true magic of</p>
<p>Silicon Valley. You know, you&rsquo;re starting a company, you</p>
<p>ask somebody to go on this adventure, take a bunch of risk,</p>
<p>they often have to cut their pay, they could get at Google</p>
<p>by half to join your adventure, it&rsquo;s only fair that you give</p>
<p>them stock in the company, and they share the ups. And if the</p>
<p>company smokes it, they get rich for taking that incremental</p>
<p>risk on their behalf and on their families behalf. What&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happened over the last 15 years is something totally</p>
<p>different, which is this stock as a form of early stage</p>
<p>compensation, right, continued. And there&rsquo;s a feature in</p>
<p>Silicon Valley, as companies came public, one way to kind of</p>
<p>hide an expense in a business is to bury it in SBC. So let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say Google wanted to hire somebody for $4 million, which</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing today in AI. But instead of paying them 4 million</p>
<p>in cash, which would all count against their operating profit,</p>
<p>they give them 500,000 in cash, and three and a half million</p>
<p>dollars in stock. And let&rsquo;s say they make all that stock</p>
<p>vestibule immediately, Jason, in this year, it&rsquo;s obvious to you</p>
<p>and I, that&rsquo;s just cash, the person turns around and sells it</p>
<p>to real expense of the business, real expense to the</p>
<p>shareholders. But when they report their earnings, and they</p>
<p>report adjusted EBITDA, they adjust out the three and a half</p>
<p>million dollars that they gave by way of SBC.</p>
<p>Why did stock based comp SBC get excluded from accounting? What</p>
<p>is the history of that? And is that going to change now? Are</p>
<p>people going to say and shareholders demand in this new</p>
<p>economy in this new, you know, sort of reality? Hey, you know</p>
<p>what, you can&rsquo;t play fun with numbers here. Stock based comp</p>
<p>has to come out. What would you like to see Brad?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fairly esoteric, but they&rsquo;re back in the mid 2000s</p>
<p>2004 2005. There was a, an accountant, there was a big</p>
<p>debate about this. Warren Buffett was famously saying,</p>
<p>listen, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you pay in stock,</p>
<p>whether you pay in cash, whether you pay in cans of beers, like</p>
<p>it all costs the same. He&rsquo;s right. And so there was a</p>
<p>debate. We had a statement and accounting statement FASB 123.</p>
<p>And in that statement, it said gap EBITDA must include the cost</p>
<p>of stock based compensation. So all of a sudden, if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>reporting gap EBITDA, I got to include the cost of stock, which</p>
<p>it does today. But what but what did everybody do? But what</p>
<p>happened? They started adjusting it out. Right? Because</p>
<p>they said, Hey, this is a real expense, right? Because we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not it&rsquo;s not cash. We&rsquo;re giving out the door solid. Do they</p>
<p>come up with a term for this?</p>
<p>They just call it adjusted EBITDA. And the crime, the crime</p>
<p>here is that when rates fell to zero, and everybody was making</p>
<p>money on tech stocks, nobody wanted to rock this boat. And</p>
<p>everybody just said, you know, like adjusted EBITDA kind of</p>
<p>ignored, I can, I can model it into my future dilution. So we</p>
<p>model up share count over the course of the next three years.</p>
<p>But this literally over the last five years, went parabolic.</p>
<p>Because I just shared with you the number of employees</p>
<p>exploded. The amount of share based compensation exploded. I</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s a competition for those employees, we would have</p>
<p>one base, I think just reported SBC, which hold your hat sacks,</p>
<p>was 70% of revenue, not 70% of their earnings, 70% of their</p>
<p>revenue. Just for Coinbase, we&rsquo;re talking about here. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>for Coinbase. And so you know, last week, there was something</p>
<p>that I thought was pretty brave. Booking.com on their</p>
<p>earnings call, really called this out. And what they said is,</p>
<p>listen, we&rsquo;ve been playing by the rules. We understand that</p>
<p>stock based comp is cash. And they say every every metric we</p>
<p>report includes the impact of stock based compensation. And if</p>
<p>you look over the last 15 years, if I&rsquo;m an owner of</p>
<p>booking.com, I was only diluted by about 5%. If I was an owner</p>
<p>of Salesforce, or Expedia, I was diluted by about 25%. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>25% of my ups were given away. Right. But yet, those things</p>
<p>were adjusted out when they reported earnings. And so, you</p>
<p>know, what&rsquo;s become in vogue today is CFOs get on their</p>
<p>calls. And they said, No, no, no, no, don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to buy back a lot of shares. So we won&rsquo;t have much</p>
<p>dilution. Okay. But if you take my 2 billion of profits that</p>
<p>Chamath just talked about, and it goes right out the door, just</p>
<p>to buy back the shares you just issued, you&rsquo;re effectively</p>
<p>round tripping that money, then it just proves the point. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cash. It&rsquo;s an expense to shareholders. And my biggest</p>
<p>problem with it is it&rsquo;s led to the bloat. Because if companies</p>
<p>actually had to account for this as cash, right, as opposed to</p>
<p>being able to do it, they wouldn&rsquo;t hire as many people,</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t pay as much in stock comp. And I&rsquo;ll end with</p>
<p>this because I want to end with the solution. Every comp</p>
<p>committee on every board, frankly, their heads spin when</p>
<p>you start talking about this subject, they bring in a comp</p>
<p>consultant. And the comp consultant, they is really the</p>
<p>CYA for the comp committee, because they want to approve a</p>
<p>comp plan that&rsquo;s been recommended by the management</p>
<p>team. And they just want to know, is this what everybody</p>
<p>else is doing? Okay, so everybody&rsquo;s doing it. So the</p>
<p>comp consultant looks around and says, Yeah, all your peers</p>
<p>are doing this. This is why Charlie Munger said, I&rsquo;d rather</p>
<p>throw a pit viper down the front of my shirt than hire a</p>
<p>comp consultant. Right? What is going on on these comp</p>
<p>committees? If you give bonuses to anybody in your business,</p>
<p>that are that is based on an adjusted EBITDA metric, rather</p>
<p>than free cash flow per share, per share is the key here. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>negligence. It&rsquo;s negligence. So if comp committees just walk in</p>
<p>and they say the gold standard as a public company is 50 basis</p>
<p>points, annual dilution, that&rsquo;s Apple, that&rsquo;s booking.com visa</p>
<p>mastercard, or even below that, that&rsquo;s the gold standard once</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the public markets, and we will never incentivize</p>
<p>our employees, our employees on the basis of anything that</p>
<p>excludes stock comp, and it has to be on a per share basis, that</p>
<p>would be a massive leap forward for public company accounts.</p>
<p>It seems reasonable. Anybody have any other thoughts on that</p>
<p>stock based comp? No. All right, Zach, where do you want to go?</p>
<p>You want to go Fox?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do Fox.</p>
<p>Yes, let&rsquo;s do Fox. I mean, Fox is kind of crazy. Okay, so</p>
<p>Rupert Murdoch had been deposed here with this Dominion voting</p>
<p>system lawsuit, they&rsquo;re suing Fox for 1.6 billion in damages</p>
<p>over claims made on air that we all know, around technology</p>
<p>enabled election fraud. We remember this wild period at the</p>
<p>end of the last election cycle with this incredibly false claim</p>
<p>that the election was stolen, something, you know, both sides</p>
<p>of the aisle said did not happen. However, it seems that</p>
<p>the hosts on Fox knew it wasn&rsquo;t happening, knew it wasn&rsquo;t true,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re engaging in entertainment of allowing these</p>
<p>people to come on air and say the election was stolen. So</p>
<p>Murdoch said, I would have liked us to be stronger in denouncing</p>
<p>it in hindsight. And when asked if he could have stopped the</p>
<p>host from highlighting these allegations, these false</p>
<p>allegations on air that were obvious to everybody. He said I</p>
<p>could have but I didn&rsquo;t. He said the truth. He&rsquo;s not allowed to</p>
<p>lie in court. Yeah, just on air. But I mean, just I mean,</p>
<p>sacks, to be fair, like, you really care about freedom of</p>
<p>speech. You really care about the libel laws. You really care</p>
<p>about the GOP. Obviously, you bring it up every week here. So</p>
<p>when you looked at and but you were very clear, you were not</p>
<p>happy about the election denial, all that like false claims that</p>
<p>Trump made and these insane people he put around himself. So</p>
<p>how do you look at these Fox hosts and listen, you&rsquo;ve been on</p>
<p>Tucker and other things, knowingly spreading lies about</p>
<p>something as important as the election, and then doing it in</p>
<p>the most cynical ways we we sit here and every week we roast the</p>
<p>media, the mainstream media, you particularly go after the Dems</p>
<p>and the left and the media elites. How do you feel about</p>
<p>these media elites, who are part of the GOP machine, lying</p>
<p>incessantly about something as important as the election</p>
<p>integrity of the United States of America?</p>
<p>First of all, you&rsquo;re trying to tee this up as some giant dunk</p>
<p>on me, J. Cal.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not. No, I&rsquo;m not. You said from the beginning, I need</p>
<p>to remind you didn&rsquo;t believe in this.</p>
<p>Exactly. Let&rsquo;s go back to November of 2020 on the show,</p>
<p>because there may be a lot of parts of the audience that</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t watching back then. I was really clear that I said</p>
<p>Sidney Powell and 100% and Rudy Giuliani, I thought they were</p>
<p>wackos. And this whole idea that the Dominion voting machines</p>
<p>had somehow been rigged, and somehow it involved Hugo Chavez</p>
<p>was a wild conspiracy theory. So I said at the time 100% that I</p>
<p>also said that I thought that once the Supreme Court denied</p>
<p>certiorari to Trump, I said that he had his right to have his day</p>
<p>in court, and to challenge the election in court, but once that</p>
<p>the court threw out his claims, and the Supreme Court denied</p>
<p>certiorari, that that whole thing needed to stop. And it</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t stop. And that&rsquo;s why the Republicans lost that Purdue</p>
<p>runoff seat in Georgia on January 5, and you had January 6.</p>
<p>So, you know, I&rsquo;ve been warning against this for a long time,</p>
<p>J. Cal. Now with respect to Fox, I think you need to basically</p>
<p>get a little bit more nuanced in what you&rsquo;re saying there.</p>
<p>Because I think within Fox, there were actually two groups</p>
<p>of hosts. So there is one group of hosts that I think you could</p>
<p>say were Trump loyalists. And they basically not only</p>
<p>platformed the Sidney Powell lies, but also endorsed them and</p>
<p>Rupert Murdoch admitted that they went too far and actually</p>
<p>endorsed. And so you had Hannity and a couple other hosts do</p>
<p>that, even though Hannity had some text messages that</p>
<p>indicated he didn&rsquo;t believe it. So I think he came across the</p>
<p>worst. However, there were within Fox skeptics of the</p>
<p>Sidney Powell theory. And so I&rsquo;d put Tucker Carlson in that</p>
<p>camp. I put Laurie Ingram in that camp. And Tucker had</p>
<p>Sidney Powell on his show on I think it was November 19. I</p>
<p>think this was 16 days after the election. It was a 20 minute</p>
<p>interview in which he grilled her and he kept coming back to</p>
<p>what is your evidence? What is your proof? And if you were</p>
<p>paying attention, he demolished her. I mean, I remember that</p>
<p>notable. Yeah, exactly. So I mean, honestly, no one looks</p>
<p>great when all of your text messages come out. And you can</p>
<p>nitpick about this or that text. But the bottom line is I think</p>
<p>Tucker did his job. You know, yes, he platform Sidney Powell,</p>
<p>but he platformed her in order to dismantle her. And you kind</p>
<p>of have to be pretty dopey not to see that she was dismantled</p>
<p>after the appearance of Tucker</p>
<p>Fox be liable for knowingly platforming these people and</p>
<p>endorsing them in some way? Or is it their freedom of speech in</p>
<p>your mind, as an attorney here, or somebody with that, you know,</p>
<p>legal degree? Where does it stand? Like, put aside if this</p>
<p>was if this was CNN doing it, MSNBC will switch what</p>
<p>publication if this was the New York Times, and they knowingly</p>
<p>lied, knowingly platformed some coops with a conspiracy theory,</p>
<p>what should the price they pay for? And then how does that</p>
<p>affect the freedom of speech that we all think I think</p>
<p>universally on this podcast, especially and in Silicon</p>
<p>Valley, or at least we used to, that freedom of speech is</p>
<p>really important. Do you have the freedom to lie and platform</p>
<p>coops like this?</p>
<p>Let me answer you directly, Jason, I think this would be a</p>
<p>better world if Fox were liable. But I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be because that&rsquo;s not the legal standard. I believe that</p>
<p>if a television network knowingly spreads and endorses</p>
<p>baseless accusations against somebody, which they know, or</p>
<p>should know is basically untrue, I think they should</p>
<p>absolutely be liable for libel or defamation. But that is not</p>
<p>what the law requires under New York Times versus Sullivan,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re required to show that that they knowingly spread</p>
<p>misinformation. But in addition, you have to show that they had</p>
<p>actual malice, which is that their intent was malicious. And</p>
<p>I think, you know, Rupert Murdoch is a wily old dog,</p>
<p>because he admitted on the stand everything but the thing that</p>
<p>was most important for the plaintiffs to prove, which is</p>
<p>actual malice. He admitted that they platform things that they,</p>
<p>you know, knew or should have known were false. He admitted</p>
<p>that he should have put a lid on it sooner. He admitted that he</p>
<p>knew it wasn&rsquo;t true. But he said the reason they did it is</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re afraid of their audience or a portion of their</p>
<p>audience going to some rival network. So basically, what he</p>
<p>said is, in not so many words is that his motivation was greed.</p>
<p>And in our system of law, that is a complete defense against</p>
<p>claims of defamation. Now, I think what we need here is to</p>
<p>rewrite the defamation laws, I think the Supreme Court needs to</p>
<p>overturn New York versus Sullivan. Clarence Thomas is</p>
<p>basically intimated that he would support that. I think</p>
<p>that would be a great thing to do. I think actual malice should</p>
<p>not be the requirement for libel. I think if a television</p>
<p>network or a publication puts out information they know is</p>
<p>false, they should absolutely be liable for it. And that is</p>
<p>enough to show. And if we did that, by the way, it wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just be Fox in this particular case, it&rsquo;d be CNN, and MSNBC,</p>
<p>we have to completely revise their coverage. And all of these</p>
<p>tech reporters who do nothing but defame the tech industry,</p>
<p>the entire tech press just about is a slow moving</p>
<p>defamation lawsuit. Elon Musk would probably be the richest</p>
<p>man in the world just based on all the defamation lawsuits he</p>
<p>could bring. If we were to overturn New York Times versus</p>
<p>the richest richer guy. Yeah, because all they do is defame</p>
<p>Elon Musk every week. Yes, for claims that are ridiculous. So</p>
<p>David, let&rsquo;s revise the whole thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, but hold on. There you go, folks. Very, very intellectually</p>
<p>honest. I like it.</p>
<p>David, so what you&rsquo;re saying is you expect the Dominion lawsuit</p>
<p>to fail? Can it be appealed all the way to the Supreme Court?</p>
<p>Can this be the case that rewrites New York versus</p>
<p>Sullivan? Good question.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question. I&rsquo;m not sure. I mean, I think that&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>great if it did. Just to be clear. Listen, I think that if</p>
<p>Fox were somehow found guilty, I think one and a half billion</p>
<p>is a kind of a ridiculous amount of damages. I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>Dominion was damaged to one and a half billion. But do I think</p>
<p>that it would be a good thing if this lawsuit were challenged</p>
<p>all the way to Supreme Court and they overruled New York</p>
<p>Times versus Sullivan?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s fund the lawsuit. Let&rsquo;s fund the lawsuit. I would fund</p>
<p>that lawsuit.</p>
<p>The next thing I want to do is sue MSNBC and CNN for all the</p>
<p>nonsense they spread every night.</p>
<p>Yeah, just to be clear, I have a couple of things that I would</p>
<p>want to go and get correct.</p>
<p>Clean up. I just want to be clear here, though, Brad. David&rsquo;s</p>
<p>guy, Tucker, he did the right thing. That&rsquo;s the most important</p>
<p>part of the story, isn&rsquo;t it, David? You&rsquo;re still a sucker for</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not being nuanced. You want to throw Tucker under the</p>
<p>bus. I think Tucker did his job. I think the guy who looks a</p>
<p>little worse is Hannity because Hannity in the text admitted he</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t believe the story. But as a Trump loyalist, he endorsed</p>
<p>the bullshit theory. That&rsquo;s no good.</p>
<p>Brad, you know, you come on the show every couple of episodes</p>
<p>and pitch in here as our fifth Beatle. Would you like to touch</p>
<p>the third rail? What are your thoughts? And would you like to</p>
<p>get some incoming email from all your LPs about your position</p>
<p>on Fox News and</p>
<p>just feel like I sat through a University of Chicago law school</p>
<p>class. It was awesome. And I think we have some good issues</p>
<p>here that we still got to tick off on J Cal. Yes. Okay, well,</p>
<p>we got to talk just for a second about China, as it relates to</p>
<p>tick tock, because, because this right, here we go. This Hawley</p>
<p>hearing that&rsquo;s coming up. So we&rsquo;ve got a hearing in Congress.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with you are a shareholder, a significant</p>
<p>shareholder in ByteDance, the parent company of tick tock. We</p>
<p>have to say that I&rsquo;m correct. Correct. Correct. And you</p>
<p>you started that I can&rsquo;t use tick tock. And my kids use reels</p>
<p>and everybody you and I&rsquo;ve had a spirited debate on. Yes, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a shareholder. Okay, so we&rsquo;re about this. So I so I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>interested up you want to hold on a second here, like because</p>
<p>just like sacks had to defend himself before he even got</p>
<p>started. Otherwise, my credibility, like the way I have</p>
<p>to do the same thing. I&rsquo;m a shareholder of meta, who stands</p>
<p>to do incredibly well, if tick tock in the US is banned. So</p>
<p>you have a spreadsheet where you win either way. I&rsquo;ve got a</p>
<p>hedge on good. Okay. You know, if tick tock in the US gets</p>
<p>banned, but you know, the con the context here is the tick</p>
<p>tock ban debate is heating up. Right. And it&rsquo;s all in a</p>
<p>march up to the Holly hearing. I think it&rsquo;s on March 23. And</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s real like we spent a lot of time at the start of this</p>
<p>pod on inflation. I think a much bigger issue right now. I was</p>
<p>just with all these investors. The main issue on their mind was</p>
<p>global decoupling between China and the United States. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to see a level of Chinese hate leveled out of out of</p>
<p>Congress both sides. I mean, we heard it come off at dinner at</p>
<p>your place not so long ago, that this hearing is drawing</p>
<p>more demand for speakers from both sides of the aisle than</p>
<p>any such conference in a long time. But there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of heat now around tick tock, should it be</p>
<p>banned. And when I when I look at the situation, if you frame</p>
<p>it for ByteDance, because Chamath talked about this a</p>
<p>couple weeks ago, it&rsquo;s been reported. ByteDance is revenues</p>
<p>about $120 billion. It&rsquo;s been reported their profits are</p>
<p>about $25 billion. That is almost identical in size to</p>
<p>meta meta is worth about 450 billion. So 120 billion top</p>
<p>line. It&rsquo;s also been leaked that in that tick tock is about</p>
<p>14 billion of that. And that us tick tock is three to 4 billion</p>
<p>us tick tock three to 4 billion of 120. And it loses money. So</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of debate, should we ban it? Should we not ban it?</p>
<p>Is it going to go public? And what should happen? What do you</p>
<p>think? What do you want to happen as a shareholder?</p>
<p>Listen, I think it&rsquo;s an American. I think this is a</p>
<p>puppet debate over a much bigger conversation that&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>One of the things I&rsquo;ve urged the company to do over the course</p>
<p>of the last several years is parental controls. My kids use</p>
<p>tick tock, they use reels. And what I want is to be able to set</p>
<p>effective time limits. And I also want tick tock has</p>
<p>incredible video content in math in science and history, I want</p>
<p>to be able to set a slider and say 20% of the videos that get</p>
<p>shown over this one hour period have to include some of these</p>
<p>math and science videos for my 12 year old, then he can elect</p>
<p>to not watch it all or watch it. They announced those product</p>
<p>changes yesterday. So they&rsquo;re teeing up those product changes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t happen to think there&rsquo;s a nefarious plot. But I also</p>
<p>understand that people might not want this. And so like,</p>
<p>listen, I think we should have a debate. I think that the CEO</p>
<p>tick tock should show up, he should speak the truth at the</p>
<p>Hawley hearing. And if the US Congress wants to ban tick tock</p>
<p>in the US or force a spin or a sale, I think we should do it</p>
<p>and stop debating it. But the much larger conversation is</p>
<p>whether we have a hard or a soft decoupling with China. And I</p>
<p>think this is just canary in the coal mine.</p>
<p>All right. So let me just tee up also, and Chamath, I&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>your reaction. On Monday, the White House gave government</p>
<p>agencies 30 days to remove tick tock from all federal devices,</p>
<p>all federal agencies must delete tick tock from phones and</p>
<p>systems and prohibit internet traffic from reaching the</p>
<p>company. This is following moves by Canada and the EU and Taiwan.</p>
<p>And obviously, there is a bigger house committee focused</p>
<p>on China that held its first meeting this week. So there is</p>
<p>the bigger picture. But let&rsquo;s start with the smaller picture.</p>
<p>Number one, Chamath, do you think it&rsquo;s a security risk to</p>
<p>have a Chinese company have this kind of access and influence</p>
<p>with tick tock specifically? And what do you think the remedy</p>
<p>should be for that? And then we&rsquo;ll get big picture. I want to</p>
<p>get sacks involved in this as well. Should it be banned?</p>
<p>Should they have this kind of access to Americans and</p>
<p>influence?</p>
<p>Should it be banned? No, because I believe in a free market.</p>
<p>Will it be banned? Yes. Because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the most obvious cultural way to pick a fight with China without</p>
<p>actually picking a fight with China. So yeah, I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be the most obvious victim of all of this. And so I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know my advice to my friends who are shareholders.</p>
<p>Not just Brad, but others is sell, sell it, move on. It&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>the Warren Buffett, what Warren Buffett calls the too hard</p>
<p>bucket.</p>
<p>sacks. Do you think that this is a national security issue? Do</p>
<p>you personally believe tick tock should be banned? Or do you like</p>
<p>me believe that we should just do a reciprocation test in order</p>
<p>for tick tock to be allowed here in the United States, then</p>
<p>Twitter, Facebook, Meta, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc. need to</p>
<p>be allowed in China, and you have this many days to</p>
<p>reciprocate or else it&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think your mouth is right that tick tock is going to</p>
<p>be GPC roadkill. And GPC stands for great power competition,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to start hearing that term more and more, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to become the organizing principle of American foreign</p>
<p>policy. And I just think that tick tock is tick tock is all</p>
<p>caught up in that. And you know, personally, I&rsquo;d like to</p>
<p>understand what it is exactly that they&rsquo;re doing with tick</p>
<p>tock. And so there&rsquo;s having these vague accusations, I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>actually really like to understand the surveillance</p>
<p>that they might be doing. Yeah, I&rsquo;d like to know a lot more</p>
<p>about that. But in any event, I just think you&rsquo;re gonna get</p>
<p>caught up in this this, again, GPC, that&rsquo;s going to be the</p>
<p>dominant organizing principle of our foreign policy. I think</p>
<p>that people are coming around to realizing that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>China, not Russia, that is the central global competitor and</p>
<p>adversary, the United States, it&rsquo;s the only country in the</p>
<p>world that&rsquo;s a potential peer competitor to us, this economy</p>
<p>is roughly the same size, the US has got four times the</p>
<p>population, it&rsquo;s the one that we really need to watch out for.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s growing realization in Washington, that</p>
<p>the Ukraine war is a little bit of a misdirect. And that we</p>
<p>need to basically get back to doing what we were doing before</p>
<p>the war, which is pivoting to Asia.</p>
<p>And by the way, thinking about that, just for a second. In I</p>
<p>think, David, you&rsquo;re totally right, because the game theory</p>
<p>now, to me, makes a lot more sense in the frame in the</p>
<p>framing of GPC. So for example, if you think about what the</p>
<p>CHIPS Act does, right? The CHIPS Act basically says we are</p>
<p>going to near shore, or onshore, every capability we need, so</p>
<p>that we can make and manufacture all the critical</p>
<p>semiconductors for all of our interests, technological,</p>
<p>business, military, etc. But what is that really what that</p>
<p>is, is an option to not have to defend Taiwan. And why is that</p>
<p>important? It&rsquo;s because today, if Taiwan were invaded by China,</p>
<p>we get pulled into a conflagration that we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how it ends. We don&rsquo;t know what the beginning, middle of end of</p>
<p>it looks like it&rsquo;s extremely dangerous and precarious. So</p>
<p>spend a couple trillion dollars create financial incentives,</p>
<p>build a bridge to Korea and to Japan so that they bring onshore</p>
<p>and into Mexico all the capabilities we need with</p>
<p>Western Europe, who are already our allies already, along with</p>
<p>Japan and Korea. And now all of a sudden, we have complete</p>
<p>optionality. And now we can deal with the greater Chinese</p>
<p>hegemony in a much more balanced way. So I think the GPC</p>
<p>framing is shared, by the way, between the Democrats and the</p>
<p>Republicans. So this is why it&rsquo;s so much bigger than one</p>
<p>single company. That&rsquo;s why I think I think it talks roadkill</p>
<p>Brad, if we frame it as a competition, we&rsquo;re not framing</p>
<p>it as a war. We&rsquo;re in competition. And part of that is</p>
<p>going to be this decoupling is this decoupling helpful to</p>
<p>America? Is it helpful to humanity? Is it better that we</p>
<p>decouple a bit this interdependency maybe got a</p>
<p>little too deep as we saw during COVID with supply chains?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, in a great in a great power struggle, it is what</p>
<p>the words imply. Right. So I don&rsquo;t, you know, part of the</p>
<p>reason you want to have trade with China, and part of the</p>
<p>reason we don&rsquo;t want to have a hard hard decoupling is, you</p>
<p>know, a long standing theory that company countries that</p>
<p>trade together are less likely to go to war. So, you know, I</p>
<p>think if you listen to what&rsquo;s coming out of this, you know,</p>
<p>these select committee this week that held his first hearing</p>
<p>is on the, on the extremes, you hear people saying hard</p>
<p>decoupling, right. And in the middle, you have people saying,</p>
<p>listen, we need to define a circumference around national</p>
<p>security. And we need to decouple as to all things that</p>
<p>are within that circumference. Now, I will tell you that the</p>
<p>debate is about how large is that circle. So it starts off</p>
<p>as, for example, sophisticated computer chips out of Nvidia.</p>
<p>So China, you know, can&rsquo;t compete with us in the AI arms</p>
<p>race. But it&rsquo;s quickly emerged into, you know, batteries,</p>
<p>energy, food, supply chains, it, the circumference has now</p>
<p>become almost as large as the economy itself, I would argue</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not just the chips act, it&rsquo;s also IRA, which is</p>
<p>another trillion dollars of funding for basically onshore</p>
<p>and supply chains, vital materials to build batteries,</p>
<p>etc. You know, so I think it&rsquo;s a very reasonable policy by</p>
<p>both parties to pursue, it&rsquo;s clear that we&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>some decoupling. I think it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s going to lead to an</p>
<p>interesting question on the part of China, you know, she was</p>
<p>out last week saying, you know, I&rsquo;m going to make a speech</p>
<p>about peace with Russia. You know, this is more David&rsquo;s</p>
<p>territory. But my hunch is that there may be, you know, if</p>
<p>China, China thinks there&rsquo;s going to be a hard decoupling</p>
<p>from an economic perspective. This is bad for global economic</p>
<p>growth. This is bad for China&rsquo;s growth. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s bad</p>
<p>for growth. I think it&rsquo;s bad for inflation. Explain? Well,</p>
<p>because I think that we&rsquo;ll have many versions of everything</p>
<p>everywhere. So we will more redundancy. Yeah, more</p>
<p>redundancy. We&rsquo;re gonna we&rsquo;re gonna rely on Central and South</p>
<p>America in a meaningfully bigger way. And what that&rsquo;ll mean is</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;ll be more jobs and economic prosperity for those</p>
<p>countries, they&rsquo;ll feed the United States, China will feed</p>
<p>it less. And as a result, there&rsquo;ll be more inflation,</p>
<p>because you won&rsquo;t have the cost advantages. By the way, China is</p>
<p>not just going to sit there and take this lying down. They&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>already punched back a few times. So for example, in the</p>
<p>middle of the summer, China introduced a tariff and slowing</p>
<p>the export of certain materials and technology to make solar</p>
<p>wafers. Now, why is that critical? Well, again, talked</p>
<p>about this before, but we are going to take the marginal cost</p>
<p>of energy to zero in this country. And the levelized cost</p>
<p>of energy, particularly via solar is the cheapest it&rsquo;s ever</p>
<p>been. And so what China sees is, oh, my gosh, if the United</p>
<p>States has abundant free energy, now, all of a sudden, a huge</p>
<p>component of what drives costs is gone. Yep. So now the United</p>
<p>States could partner with El Salvador, Mexico, Honduras, you</p>
<p>know, Argentina, Brazil, Vietnam is happening here, too. Yeah.</p>
<p>No, but I&rsquo;m just saying it&rsquo;s close by. Yes. Right. And if you</p>
<p>can deliver zero cost energy to those places, now the</p>
<p>manufacturing capability could exist there. My point is, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>such a complicated Chesapeake. So China is not taking any of</p>
<p>this line down. But I think that what David&rsquo;s framing is totally</p>
<p>accurate. This is the beginning of a GPC. And it&rsquo;s an economic</p>
<p>tit for tat that we&rsquo;re going to play out. We tax chips, they</p>
<p>tax solar panels, we go after tick tock just as a confusion</p>
<p>maker, right? Yeah, there&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of</p>
<p>follies back and forth here. I can tell you the the there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>very easy test for if China sees tick tock as a strategic asset.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s going to create more shareholder value, Brad, if</p>
<p>they were to spin it out and make it a publicly traded</p>
<p>American company with American shareholders, it would create</p>
<p>more shareholder value for bite dense. Therefore, if they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>spin it out, that means they&rsquo;re not acting in the interest of</p>
<p>shareholders and shareholder value. They&rsquo;re acting in the</p>
<p>interest of their national security. Pretty clear</p>
<p>reciprocation and collaboration would be a much better model, I</p>
<p>think for for working with the Chinese and hopefully we can</p>
<p>find some things to collaborate on</p>
<p>Brad raised the the Chinese peace proposal on Ukraine, which</p>
<p>I think is an interesting topic. Can we you guys want to go there</p>
<p>for a minute? Sure. Yeah. All right. Can I take a shot</p>
<p>explaining what the Chinese were doing? I think it was a clever</p>
<p>diplomatic maneuver by the Chinese to try and grab the</p>
<p>moral high ground here. They&rsquo;re basically saying, Listen, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>interested in peace, we&rsquo;re going to put forward a proposal, the</p>
<p>Americans fell into the trap of basically dismissing it right</p>
<p>away, throwing cold water on it. The US State Department has</p>
<p>done this twice before. Remember, back in March of last</p>
<p>year, enough Tali Bennett from Israel tried to negotiate a</p>
<p>peace deal. And he himself said that it was the West, the</p>
<p>Americans who rejected it, he thought it had a 5050 chance of</p>
<p>succeeding, you then had the peace process in Istanbul,</p>
<p>Turkey, with Erdogan presiding over it, you had the, the</p>
<p>Istanbul communique, which again, they were very close to</p>
<p>having a peace deal, and Blinken in the US through cold water on</p>
<p>it. So what&rsquo;s happening here is that the US is not playing its</p>
<p>traditional role as peacemaker, where we try to go in and</p>
<p>mediate these conflicts. We&rsquo;re doing the opposite that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>throwing cold water than peace process. Now, why are we not</p>
<p>acting as the mediator? I&rsquo;ll tell you why. Because we are a</p>
<p>co belligerent. This is an American proxy war that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fighting against Russia. So we have no interest in mediating a</p>
<p>peace process. And moreover, we&rsquo;re not trusted to mediate a</p>
<p>peace process because we&rsquo;re one of the effectively one of the</p>
<p>strategy by Xi Jinping is to take the global moral high</p>
<p>ground. I agree with now and I said it on Twitter a couple</p>
<p>weeks ago like this. This is amazing that he&rsquo;s starting the</p>
<p>peace process. We want regime change. We want to deplete and</p>
<p>we want to ankle Putin. They want to keep him in the game.</p>
<p>The more despots there are, the worse, the better it is for</p>
<p>them. They would like to keep the Legion of Doom going. They</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to change in democracy in Russia. Eventually,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s how they do it. But listen, Jake, Jake, I</p>
<p>was very close to getting it. But here&rsquo;s where I would</p>
<p>disagree with you a little bit. Let me explain. Okay, go ahead.</p>
<p>So from the Chinese point of view, the war in Ukraine is like</p>
<p>mana from heaven. Okay, they love this war. Number one, okay,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s interfering with the US&rsquo;s pivot to Asia. We were</p>
<p>basically in the process of redeploying all of our force,</p>
<p>all of our military to containing them in East Asia.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re bogged down in Europe. Okay, so that&rsquo;s number</p>
<p>one. Number two, we are massively depleting our</p>
<p>stockpiles of weapons. We&rsquo;ve used something like nine years</p>
<p>of stingers and five years of javelins. And we&rsquo;re running out</p>
<p>of ammunition. I can&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re running out of artillery.</p>
<p>The Russians actually have a six to one artillery advantage,</p>
<p>which is why they&rsquo;re actually doing much better in this war</p>
<p>than people are acknowledging, we should come back to that.</p>
<p>The last thing is that the Chinese now are benefiting from</p>
<p>the economic sanctions on Russia, because Russia is now</p>
<p>selling them oil and gas and all their minerals at a big</p>
<p>discount subsidy. So it&rsquo;s been this has been a wonderful thing</p>
<p>from the Chinese standpoint. So this is the problem with us</p>
<p>thinking in this Marvel movie way of the world in which we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the super friends, and we&rsquo;re against the Legion of Doom,</p>
<p>okay, is because there is no natural alliance in the real</p>
<p>world between China, Russia and Iran. These are three very</p>
<p>different regimes with different types of governments who</p>
<p>naturally would not get along. They would be adversaries,</p>
<p>naturally, they&rsquo;d be suspicious of each other, as China and</p>
<p>Russia were during the Cold War, but we have pushed them closer</p>
<p>together. This is the problem with having this overly</p>
<p>moralistic view of foreign policy.</p>
<p>Over to you, Jason, what do you think? Tell us your question.</p>
<p>Their question. What&rsquo;s the question?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you frame it as the Legion of Doom. So just</p>
<p>explain.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s the axis of evil, the the 50% of</p>
<p>Let me tell you, hold on, I&rsquo;ll finish my sentence.</p>
<p>Listen, Lex Luthor and Brainiac would not be working together</p>
<p>if it weren&rsquo;t for us declaring a war on both of them at the</p>
<p>same time. Actually, Pakistan, Iran, and, and China work</p>
<p>together on nuclear technology. So they do when it&rsquo;s convenient</p>
<p>for them work on things like nuclear bombs. So there is an</p>
<p>affiliation, but you&rsquo;re correct, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re the 50% of the</p>
<p>planet of humans on this planet who live under authoritarians.</p>
<p>And so they, they&rsquo;re authoritarians, they&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>going to think in their own interest, they&rsquo;re always going</p>
<p>to think in their own interest, above their own peoples, let</p>
<p>alone the people of another country, they don&rsquo;t care, they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t care about human rights, they don&rsquo;t care about the rights</p>
<p>of humans. And they certainly don&rsquo;t care about the rights of</p>
<p>humans in another country. And the West is on a noble mission</p>
<p>to spread democracy in the world. And that is a noble thing</p>
<p>worth fighting for, and is worth defending free countries from</p>
<p>despots. I know that you are a fan of these folks, sacks,</p>
<p>apparently, and you think they should be able to run amok, I</p>
<p>will take the other side of it. I think the West should act in</p>
<p>unison. The only criticism I have is that we&rsquo;re not acting</p>
<p>unison. I would like to see the West instead of sending Biden</p>
<p>to Ukraine. Hold on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked enough, you just accused me of somehow being</p>
<p>fans of these people. Where did I ever say that I was a fan of</p>
<p>Xi and China or Putin, or the ayatollahs in Iran? Hold on.</p>
<p>You said we provoked Putin. Putin invaded another country.</p>
<p>Hold on. You said we caused it.</p>
<p>I said, hold on a second. Hold on a second. I am arguing for a</p>
<p>geopolitical strategy that benefits the United States. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>on Team America, and your policy of driving these people</p>
<p>into an axis of evil is foolish for the reason I said, which is</p>
<p>we are going to power up the Chinese economy, so they are a</p>
<p>much more formidable enemy to the United States. That is the</p>
<p>last thing we need to do. Now, with respect to, hold on a</p>
<p>second, let me finish. You had a chance. With respect to Ukraine</p>
<p>and Putin there, there&rsquo;s no question that Putin invaded,</p>
<p>okay? He is the aggressor. However, the question you have</p>
<p>to ask is why? The fact of the matter is that, first of all, we</p>
<p>fomented a coup in Ukraine in 2014. This is your democracy</p>
<p>spreading that you like. It&rsquo;s all of a sudden we got these</p>
<p>NGOs, and we got Victoria Nuland from the State Department in</p>
<p>there basically fomenting these coups. It doesn&rsquo;t work out quite</p>
<p>the way you think, Jay Kal. That&rsquo;s problem number one, okay?</p>
<p>Then we try to run NATO right up to Russia&rsquo;s border, okay? You</p>
<p>expect them just to accept that because we&rsquo;re a benevolent</p>
<p>superpower. That&rsquo;s not the way the real world works. Putin was</p>
<p>tremendously threatened by that, and it wasn&rsquo;t just him. It was</p>
<p>all Russian elites. Read the Bill Burns Memo from 2008,</p>
<p>he explains that even the liberal elements within Russia</p>
<p>were tremendously threatened by NATO expansion. That is what</p>
<p>basically poisoned diplomatic relations between the United</p>
<p>States and Russia, and it was a major cause of this war. Now,</p>
<p>listen, just because you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s provocative doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mean that the Russians don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s provocative. You have</p>
<p>to be able to put yourself in the other guy&rsquo;s shoes for just</p>
<p>one second. The fact of the matter is there were diplomatic</p>
<p>steps that we could have taken to defuse this crisis in this</p>
<p>war, and we didn&rsquo;t do it. Now, look what&rsquo;s happened. Hundreds</p>
<p>of thousands of people have been killed, and Ukraine&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>destroyed. It&rsquo;s been absolutely destroyed. Let me tell you right</p>
<p>now, it looks like they&rsquo;re losing this war. I don&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>where your superhero policy has gotten us except to make China</p>
<p>more powerful and to destroy Ukraine. That is where your</p>
<p>naive idealism has gotten us. Yeah. And I would say, if you if</p>
<p>left to your devices, and you&rsquo;re not engaging and not presenting</p>
<p>a united front against Putin, he will invade country after</p>
<p>country, the West must fight for democracy, we must fight for</p>
<p>human rights, even if it&rsquo;s uncomfortable. And you seem to</p>
<p>think we provoked him to invade this country. He&rsquo;s a murdering</p>
<p>dictator, authoritarian, who has been murdering his own people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying other people for his entire career, and he will</p>
<p>continue to clarify, let me clarify, because you&rsquo;re putting</p>
<p>words in my mouth. Okay. When you say that, I think that we</p>
<p>provoked what I believe, what I believe is that we took actions</p>
<p>that in Russian eyes were provocative. Yeah. I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>that from their subjective point of view, they saw these actions</p>
<p>as provocative. They said, so listen, the Russian, which is</p>
<p>what I said, we provoked it is your position. No, I just</p>
<p>explained this. Hold on his position is that in their eyes,</p>
<p>they were proven. Jason, we&rsquo;re talking about we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about and know what you&rsquo;re like, what you&rsquo;re doing right now is</p>
<p>like dishonest. I just explained the language that I would use.</p>
<p>Yes. Yes, we provoke them. We took actions that in Russian</p>
<p>eyes were provocative. There&rsquo;s a difference. provocative,</p>
<p>provoked. Yes, the act of provoking line. Okay, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>getting too much. Okay, let&rsquo;s move on. We&rsquo;re not we&rsquo;re never</p>
<p>going to agree on this sacks. Okay. And I mean, I like to</p>
<p>remind the audience that nobody on this podcast is an expert on</p>
<p>foreign policy. sacks is not Henry Kissinger. You know, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not Obama. So last week, show you had come around to my point</p>
<p>of view, you said this war was a mistake. On the show, you said</p>
<p>it was a disaster. And now you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re basically now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re backsliding. Hold on. You&rsquo;re backsliding right back</p>
<p>to your leisure. No, no. I believe the West should present</p>
<p>a united front. And we should hold the line with Russia</p>
<p>invading other countries. That&rsquo;s my belief. I do not think we</p>
<p>should be doing this solo. I think we should not be sending</p>
<p>Biden, we should be sending 15 leaders of countries to Ukraine,</p>
<p>we should be sending people in and we should be doing a peace</p>
<p>process. And I think the military industrial complex,</p>
<p>largely driven by the GOP is what&rsquo;s at fault here. They want</p>
<p>to use his weapons, they want to replenish the supply. And</p>
<p>they want to regime change. I don&rsquo;t think we should be going</p>
<p>for regime change. I think we should be building bridges. So</p>
<p>do you my point is a little more subtle, you&rsquo;re doing it right</p>
<p>there. You&rsquo;re basically engaging in this ridiculous rhetoric that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen in the media, which is that if you simply want a</p>
<p>more realistic American strategy, because you believe it</p>
<p>benefits America, that you&rsquo;re automatically accused of somehow</p>
<p>being a Putin sympathizer. You&rsquo;re doing what the mainstream</p>
<p>media has done. No, I&rsquo;m not. I just said to you, it should be</p>
<p>the entire West, as a group as a block, negotiating with Putin,</p>
<p>what do you think? It&rsquo;s fine for Xi Jinping to be part of that. I</p>
<p>welcome Xi Jinping, Germany and the United States and France and</p>
<p>the UK all getting together and trying to get these two parties</p>
<p>to settle. What do you think we&rsquo;re doing? What do you think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing right or wrong with China right now? Right or wrong?</p>
<p>What do you think we&rsquo;re doing right and wrong or right wrong</p>
<p>or I think we should be in discussions with them</p>
<p>consistently. I don&rsquo;t believe we should be isolating them. I</p>
<p>think we should be looking for areas we can collaborate on the</p>
<p>environment, tech, technology, you agree with the CHIPS Act,</p>
<p>you agree with basically onshoring and nearshoring all</p>
<p>the critical infrastructure we need is I think we should not be</p>
<p>dependent on any foreign we should we should have energy</p>
<p>security. We should have medical technology. Of course, yes. But</p>
<p>I think every country should I think China should have that we</p>
<p>should have it every country should aspire to be resilient</p>
<p>and not be dependent on another country. And being dependent on</p>
<p>a dictator like Germany was on Putin, or we were with China for</p>
<p>medicines or for, you know, medical equipment or chips. We</p>
<p>do not want to be in that position ever.</p>
<p>Let me ask one question just just on Ukraine, just for a</p>
<p>second, Jake out, would you be willing in order to achieve a</p>
<p>peace deal for Ukraine? Would you be willing to agree to two</p>
<p>things? Number one, that Ukraine would be a neutral country</p>
<p>instead of part of NATO? And number two, that we would</p>
<p>recognize for me being part of Russia, would you be willing to</p>
<p>give those two things?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s up not up to me. I think it&rsquo;s up to the people of</p>
<p>Ukraine and Russia to sort this out. And it&rsquo;s up for the West to</p>
<p>set the table for them to do it. And part of setting the table</p>
<p>for them to do it is to make it more painful for them to stay at</p>
<p>this war. So if they are told if you keep fighting over these</p>
<p>things, and you don&rsquo;t come to a resolution between those two</p>
<p>parties who have to live with that resolution, that is the</p>
<p>uncomfortable thing that will force them. And China, us and</p>
<p>India, all working together, all of us working together to force</p>
<p>those two parties into a solution that works for them.</p>
<p>We have Brad for 10 minutes. I want to move on. I want to show</p>
<p>you guys a tweet about Harvard students. And I want you guys to</p>
<p>react to Draymond&rsquo;s comments because they&rsquo;re just fucking</p>
<p>incredible. I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw this, but isn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>unbelievable? It says there was a study at Harvard that found</p>
<p>that 43% of white students there are legacy athletes, or</p>
<p>related to donors or staff. That&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>Is that public knowledge? Or is that like kind of leaked</p>
<p>information? I wonder this is from Dolores handy. I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>who that is. Maybe we could click on who the source of that</p>
<p>is. legacies gotta go, right? That concept? Should I just go</p>
<p>away? Yeah, is there a valid reason to have legacy? Is there</p>
<p>a valid reason to have legacy? It feels unfair. It feels</p>
<p>un-American that these important institutions give preference to</p>
<p>people who are stupider and achieve less if this is an</p>
<p>achievement based system. It just feels unfair.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, well, we know we know that the first class had</p>
<p>zero percent. So we know what the trend line looks like. Yeah.</p>
<p>So at some point, we&rsquo;re approaching 100%. I think we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>debating question, right? One of the things I would like to see</p>
<p>Chamath is what&rsquo;s the relative performance 10 years after</p>
<p>graduation between the legacies and the kids who had to fucking</p>
<p>scratch and fight to get into the place?</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Yeah. I mean, I think we know the answer.</p>
<p>Well, you would think there would be higher performers, the</p>
<p>latter group, but you would also think that if legacy got you</p>
<p>into Harvard, then the legacy is going to get you into other</p>
<p>things, right? You&rsquo;ll have the end in other places.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the ones who are miserable and walking around,</p>
<p>you know, rich and haven&rsquo;t achieved anything.</p>
<p>Yeah. Listen, Saks didn&rsquo;t get into Stanford based on his dad&rsquo;s</p>
<p>buying a building, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>Okay. So here is a video from Dream Hungry.</p>
<p>What I do want to go back to is Black History Month. This is</p>
<p>actually the first time you&rsquo;ve seen me in a Black History Month</p>
<p>shirt, all Black History Month. And it&rsquo;s very intentional.</p>
<p>And I really just threw this shirt on because I didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>another shirt to throw on. But Black History Month, at some</p>
<p>point, can we get rid of it?</p>
<p>Like, at some point, why we got to keep getting the shortest</p>
<p>month to celebrate our history?</p>
<p>You got governors want to take our history out of schools.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not going to be the fool to go say, yeah, we get</p>
<p>celebrated for 28 days.</p>
<p>So at some point, I&rsquo;d like to get rid of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, we&rsquo;re making all these changes in the world.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t talk about these people.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t talk about those people.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t say this.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t say that.</p>
<p>At some point, it&rsquo;s time to get rid of Black History Month.</p>
<p>I get rid of Black History, like they&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>But Black History Month?</p>
<p>No, teach my history from January 1st to December 31st.</p>
<p>And then do it again.</p>
<p>And then again.</p>
<p>And then again.</p>
<p>And then again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I like to see.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Strong.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>Love that guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the best.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the fucking best.</p>
<p>That was strong.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the best.</p>
<p>You need to clip the last 10 seconds of that.</p>
<p>We all need to tweet that.</p>
<p>Yeah, be relentless.</p>
<p>Chamath, there was a correction we needed to make.</p>
<p>Correction we needed to make about the Stripe chart last week.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>Yeah, so&hellip;</p>
<p>You have the floor.</p>
<p>We talked about some Stripe stuff last week.</p>
<p>And my analyst came to me after the show was published.</p>
<p>And there was a couple of miscalcs in the spreadsheet that generated the graphic,</p>
<p>which big up to him for calling it out very quickly.</p>
<p>Anyways, I just wanted to show you the updated one,</p>
<p>just so that we could make sure we get that on the record.</p>
<p>I guess this would be a purple color.</p>
<p>Is that purple?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually when you calculate net revenue.</p>
<p>And I think what he did was calculated gross revenue, which is in the red.</p>
<p>So we showed this, but it actually should be purple.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the updated, accurate version of the analysis.</p>
<p>So there you have it, folks.</p>
<p>What does that mean for Stripe versus Adyen in terms of just&hellip;</p>
<p>Which is a better business, just to summarize it?</p>
<p>No, I mean, to be honest with you, it doesn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>It says what we said before, which is that the previous valuation was very expectation heavy.</p>
<p>And the new valuation is definitely more in line,</p>
<p>but still very rich relative to other companies who have large profitability</p>
<p>and large growth rates.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the key takeaway, which is it&rsquo;s very hard to both</p>
<p>have huge margins and grow at mediumly high double-digit rates.</p>
<p>And the few that can, Visa, MasterCard, and Adyen,</p>
<p>tend to trade at a very different valuation set than everything else.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s the challenge for Stripe.</p>
<p>If they can do it, they&rsquo;ll be in that class.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>For the sultan of science, doing his SPAC in New York,</p>
<p>having an incredible dinner at Carbone right now.</p>
<p>Can I say, can I say&hellip;</p>
<p>Enjoy the vegetarian&hellip;</p>
<p>I pre-tilted him.</p>
<p>He texts into our group chat.</p>
<p>Oh, don&rsquo;t do it. Don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>And he said, let me know if you want me to dial in and save the episode.</p>
<p>My Insta reply, Gerstner&rsquo;s on fire, we&rsquo;re all set.</p>
<p>Why would you do that to him?</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>It ruined his dinner.</p>
<p>He has to go find a safe place.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s irreplaceable.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s irreplaceable.</p>
<p>Except, you know, this episode&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>Pretty good.</p>
<p>Pretty good episode.</p>
<p>Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty good.</p>
<p>We love you.</p>
<p>We love you, Sultan.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a bad episode until J. Cal started ****ing again.</p>
<p>The least you can do him, are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Just like you strike January 6th.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t strike words in English.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, you can&rsquo;t strike a single word.</p>
<p>You struck my single word last week when I called you out as a Trump voter.</p>
<p>When J. Cal gets under pressure in a debate, he falls back on all the usual virtue-signaling and ****.</p>
<p>Oh yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay. Who did you vote for in 2016, 2020?</p>
<p>Be honest.</p>
<p>See, like you&rsquo;re doing right now.</p>
<p>Look at this.</p>
<p>Oh God.</p>
<p>Did you vote for Hillary and Biden?</p>
<p>Legion of Doom.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the Legion of Doom.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re pro-Putin.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s actually a meme.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a meme on Twitter that anyone who disagrees with me is Russian disinformation</p>
<p>or pro-Putin.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen that one yet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty funny.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re pro-Putin.</p>
<p>I always try to make sure people understand.</p>
<p>During this entire year of Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine, I say every time,</p>
<p>to be clear, you&rsquo;re not saying Putin is right for invading Ukraine.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, no, of course not.</p>
<p>You just stopped.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Thank you for saying that.</p>
<p>No, thank you for saying that.</p>
<p>I appreciate that.</p>
<p>I always try to say that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s making a correction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very nuanced discussion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very nuanced discussion.</p>
<p>Like we could, nobody&rsquo;s in favor of this war.</p>
<p>Nobody.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s in favor of it.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s trying to resolve it.</p>
<p>I think we just have different views of what resolution looks like.</p>
<p>Did you guys read this crazy article in Bloomberg Businessweek about Praz Michelle,</p>
<p>the founder of, the co-founder of the Fugees and his entanglement with the one MDB scandal?</p>
<p>Did you read this article?</p>
<p>No, I have no idea.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how the article starts.</p>
<p>I like the culture at the end.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put the tinfoil hats on and do culture at the end.</p>
<p>His phone rings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Chinese woman that says something like,</p>
<p>you know, your cousin wants to meet you.</p>
<p>He goes to the Four Seasons where he gets a note that says,</p>
<p>walk around the building twice to make sure you&rsquo;re not followed.</p>
<p>Goes back into the Four Seasons, gets a key card,</p>
<p>goes upstairs into a room where they then escort him to a different room in a penthouse,</p>
<p>take all of his phones, and he meets with the vice chairman of security for China</p>
<p>where that guy is asking for an introduction to Trump.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how the article starts.</p>
<p>It is incredible reading.</p>
<p>Incredible, incredible reading.</p>
<p>I encourage all of you to read it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so spicy.</p>
<p>What is it called?</p>
<p>Juicy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so juicy.</p>
<p>Spicy.</p>
<p>If you want to read some crazy story, there is a company called Wirecard in Germany,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a New Yorker article about the biggest fraud in German history.</p>
<p>I highly recommend reading this one.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t get to it today.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>If we had a long reads post show, it would be incredible.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t think we should promote any stories by the mainstream media.</p>
<p>We have no idea whether they&rsquo;re true or not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m serious.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you soon, Brad.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for filling in.</p>
<p>Love you, Brad.</p>
<p>Thanks, bro.</p>
<p>Pretty good.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>For the Rain Man, David Sacks, the pacifist of peace, the sultan of science, Brad Gershner,</p>
<p>the dictator Chamath, I&rsquo;m the world&rsquo;s greatest moderator and speaker at your</p>
<p>corporate event for 50 to 75 times.</p>
<p>Jake out.</p>
<p>Talk to my speaker bureau.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get this gripped on, people.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you next week.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Love you, guys.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my dog taking a piss in your driveway.</p>
<p>Sacks.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>Wet your feet.</p>
<p>Wet your feet.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
