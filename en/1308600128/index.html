    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. Oded Rehavi.</p>
<p>Dr. Oded Rehavi is a professor of neurobiology</p>
<p>at Tel Aviv University in Israel.</p>
<p>His laboratory studies genetic inheritance.</p>
<p>Now, everybody is familiar with genetic inheritance</p>
<p>as the idea that we inherit genes from our parents,</p>
<p>and indeed that is true.</p>
<p>Many people are also probably now aware</p>
<p>of the so-called epigenome,</p>
<p>that is ways in which our environment and experiences</p>
<p>can change our genome,</p>
<p>and therefore the genes that we inherit</p>
<p>or pass on to our children.</p>
<p>What is less known, however,</p>
<p>and what is discussed today</p>
<p>is the evidence that we can actually pass on</p>
<p>traits that relate to our experiences.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s evidence in worms, in flies, in mice,</p>
<p>and indeed in human beings</p>
<p>that memories can indeed be passed</p>
<p>from one generation to the next.</p>
<p>And that turns out to be just the tip of the iceberg</p>
<p>in terms of how our parents&rsquo; experiences</p>
<p>and our experiences can be passed on</p>
<p>from one generation to the next,</p>
<p>both in terms of modifying the biological circuits</p>
<p>of the brain and body,</p>
<p>and the psychological consequences</p>
<p>of those biological changes.</p>
<p>During today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>Dr. Rehavi gives us a beautiful description</p>
<p>of how genetics work.</p>
<p>So even if you don&rsquo;t have a background</p>
<p>in biology or science,</p>
<p>by the end of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>you will understand the core elements of genetics</p>
<p>and the genetic passage of traits</p>
<p>from one generation to the next.</p>
<p>In addition, he makes it clear</p>
<p>how certain experiences can indeed modify our genes</p>
<p>such that they are passed from our parents to us,</p>
<p>and even transgenerationally across multi-generations.</p>
<p>That is, one generation could experience something</p>
<p>and their grandchildren</p>
<p>would still have genetic modifications</p>
<p>that reflect those prior experiences of their grandparents.</p>
<p>Dr. Rehavi takes us on an incredible journey</p>
<p>explaining how our genes</p>
<p>and different patterns of inheritance</p>
<p>shape our experience of life and who we are.</p>
<p>Before we begin,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Roka.</p>
<p>Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses</p>
<p>that are the absolute highest quality.</p>
<p>The company was founded by two all-American swimmers</p>
<p>from Stanford,</p>
<p>and everything about Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses</p>
<p>were designed with performance in mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lifetime working on the biology</p>
<p>of the visual system,</p>
<p>and I can tell you that your visual system</p>
<p>has to contend with an enormous number of challenges</p>
<p>in order for you to be able to see clearly</p>
<p>under any conditions.</p>
<p>Roka understands this</p>
<p>and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses accordingly.</p>
<p>Originally, Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses</p>
<p>were designed for sport,</p>
<p>that is for things like running and cycling,</p>
<p>and many of the features they have reflect that.</p>
<p>So for instance, they are extremely lightweight,</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t slip off your face if you get sweaty,</p>
<p>and they can indeed be worn for running and cycling</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>However, they also come in a number</p>
<p>of different aesthetics and styles</p>
<p>that make them perfectly suited,</p>
<p>not just for sport,</p>
<p>but also for wearing to the office, to work.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Roka eyeglasses or sunglasses,</p>
<p>go to Roka, that&rsquo;s R-O-K-A.com,</p>
<p>and enter the code Huberman</p>
<p>to save 20% off your first order.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s Roka, R-O-K-A.com,</p>
<p>enter the code Huberman at checkout.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by HVMN Ketone IQ.</p>
<p>Ketone IQ is a ketone supplement</p>
<p>that increases blood ketones.</p>
<p>Almost everybody has heard of the so-called ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>Most people, including myself,</p>
<p>do not follow a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>That does not, however, mean</p>
<p>that ketones cannot be valuable</p>
<p>because ketones are one of the primary sources</p>
<p>of brain fuel and body fuel</p>
<p>that allows us to think clearly for long durations of time</p>
<p>and to perform well physically,</p>
<p>which is all to say that even if you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s not on a ketogenic diet, such as myself,</p>
<p>increasing your blood ketones can be immensely beneficial</p>
<p>for cognitive and physical performance.</p>
<p>Indeed, that&rsquo;s how I use ketone IQ.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take one or two servings per day typically,</p>
<p>sometimes before a workout,</p>
<p>but most typically before doing a bout of cognitive work.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to sit down and prepare a podcast</p>
<p>or focus on research for my lab or a writing project</p>
<p>or anything that requires a high degree of concentration</p>
<p>for a prolonged period of time.</p>
<p>Ingesting ketone IQ prior to that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed greatly increases my level of concentration</p>
<p>and I can sustain that concentration</p>
<p>for much longer periods of time</p>
<p>than if I don&rsquo;t take ketone IQ.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try ketone IQ,</p>
<p>you can go to hvmn.com slash Huberman to save 20% off.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.</p>
<p>Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers</p>
<p>with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve talked about many times before on the podcast,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a critical relationship</p>
<p>between sleep and temperature</p>
<p>and indeed between waking up and temperature.</p>
<p>That is your body temperature needs to decrease</p>
<p>by about one to three degrees</p>
<p>in order for you to fall and stay deeply asleep at night.</p>
<p>And when you wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>in order to do that feeling refreshed,</p>
<p>your body temperature actually needs to increase</p>
<p>by about one to three degrees.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s critical that you control the temperature</p>
<p>of your sleeping environment</p>
<p>and that that temperature be controlled very specifically</p>
<p>across the night and into the morning.</p>
<p>With Eight Sleep mattress covers,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all extremely easy to do.</p>
<p>You can program the temperature of your mattress</p>
<p>in the beginning, middle, and throughout the night,</p>
<p>and when you wake up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover</p>
<p>for over a year now,</p>
<p>and it has greatly improved the quality of my sleep.</p>
<p>And indeed, I know that because Eight Sleep</p>
<p>also includes a terrific sleep tracker</p>
<p>built directly into that mattress cover.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Eight Sleep,</p>
<p>you can go to eightsleep.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to save $150 off their pod three cover.</p>
<p>Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,</p>
<p>select countries in the EU and Australia.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s eightsleep.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. Oded Rahavi.</p>
<p>Oded, thank you so much for being here.</p>
<p>Totally my pleasure.</p>
<p>Yeah, this podcast has a somewhat unusual origin</p>
<p>because I am familiar with your work,</p>
<p>but we essentially met on Twitter,</p>
<p>where you are known for many things,</p>
<p>but lately, especially, you have been focusing</p>
<p>not just on the discoveries in your laboratory</p>
<p>and other laboratories,</p>
<p>but also sort of meme type humor</p>
<p>that relates to the scientific process.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll return to this a little bit later.</p>
<p>But first of all, I think it&rsquo;s wonderful</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re so active on social media</p>
<p>in this positive stance around science</p>
<p>that also includes humor.</p>
<p>But today, what I mainly want to talk about</p>
<p>is the incredible questions that you probe in your lab,</p>
<p>which are highly unusual, incredibly significant</p>
<p>for each and all of our lives, and very controversial,</p>
<p>and at times even a little bit dangerous or morbid.</p>
<p>So this is going to be a fun one for me</p>
<p>and for the audience.</p>
<p>Just to start off very basically,</p>
<p>you get everyone up to speed</p>
<p>because people have different backgrounds.</p>
<p>I think most people have a general understanding</p>
<p>of what genes are, what RNA is, and so on,</p>
<p>but maybe you could explain to people in very basic terms.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just preface all this by saying</p>
<p>that I think most people understand</p>
<p>that if they have two blue-eyed parents,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a higher probability</p>
<p>that their offspring will have blue eyes than brown eyes.</p>
<p>Similarly, if two brown-eyed parents,</p>
<p>higher probability that they will have brown eyes</p>
<p>rather than blue eyes, and so on.</p>
<p>But that most people generally understand and accept</p>
<p>that if they spend part of their life,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say studying architecture,</p>
<p>that if they have children,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no real genetic reason, we assume,</p>
<p>that their children would somehow be better at architecture</p>
<p>because they contain the knowledge</p>
<p>through the DNA of their parents.</p>
<p>They might be exposed to it in the home,</p>
<p>so-called nature nurture, that&rsquo;s a nurture in that case,</p>
<p>but that they wouldn&rsquo;t inherit knowledge or other traits.</p>
<p>And today, I&rsquo;m hoping you can explain to us</p>
<p>why eye color but not knowledge is thought to be inherited</p>
<p>and the huge landscape of interesting questions</p>
<p>that this opens up, including some evidence</p>
<p>that contrary to what we might think,</p>
<p>certain types of knowledge at the level of cells</p>
<p>and systems can be inherited.</p>
<p>So that was a very long-winded opening,</p>
<p>but to frame things up,</p>
<p>what is DNA, what is RNA,</p>
<p>and how does inheritance really work?</p>
<p>Okay, so DNA is the material, the genetic instructions</p>
<p>that is contained in every one of our cells.</p>
<p>We have the set of genes containing,</p>
<p>the entire set is called the genome,</p>
<p>and this is present in every cell of our body,</p>
<p>the same set of instructions.</p>
<p>And genes are made of DNA,</p>
<p>and they also contain, and chromosomes,</p>
<p>they are containing chromosomes.</p>
<p>Chromosomes is the DNA and the proteins</p>
<p>that condense the DNA,</p>
<p>because we have a huge amount of DNA in every cell</p>
<p>that you need to condense it to.</p>
<p>Sort of like thread on a spool.</p>
<p>Right, huge amounts that you have to condense.</p>
<p>And we have the same genome,</p>
<p>the same DNA in every cell in our body.</p>
<p>Can I just interrupt, and I&rsquo;ll do that periodically</p>
<p>just to make sure that people are being carried along.</p>
<p>I sometimes find that even remarkable,</p>
<p>that a skin cell and a brain cell,</p>
<p>a neuron for instance, very different functions,</p>
<p>but they all contain the full menu of genes</p>
<p>and the same menu of genes.</p>
<p>No, it is amazing.</p>
<p>It is amazing.</p>
<p>And perhaps it&rsquo;s good to have an analogy</p>
<p>to understand how it works.</p>
<p>So this is, I hope this is not a commercial,</p>
<p>but this is like the Ikea book</p>
<p>that you have in every cell in your body,</p>
<p>the instructions to make everything</p>
<p>that you need in your house,</p>
<p>the chairs, the kitchen, the pictures,</p>
<p>but in every room you want something else.</p>
<p>So in the kitchen you want things that fit the kitchen,</p>
<p>and in the toilet you want things that fit the toilet.</p>
<p>So you only remove one particular page of instructions,</p>
<p>which is the instructions of how to build a chair.</p>
<p>And this you place in the living room, okay.</p>
<p>And in the toilet, you put it in the toilet.</p>
<p>So the DNA is the instruction to make,</p>
<p>the genome is the instruction to make everything.</p>
<p>This is the Ikea book.</p>
<p>And in every cell, we take just the instructions</p>
<p>for make one particular furniture, and this is the RNA.</p>
<p>This is the RNA, this is the set.</p>
<p>And then the end, you&rsquo;ll build a chair,</p>
<p>the chair is the protein.</p>
<p>So the DNA, the RNA are instructions</p>
<p>to make one particular protein</p>
<p>based on the entire set of possibilities.</p>
<p>And this is true for one particular type of RNA,</p>
<p>which won&rsquo;t be the star of this conversation,</p>
<p>which is messenger RNA.</p>
<p>This is the RNA that contains the information</p>
<p>for making proteins.</p>
<p>In fact, this is just a small percent</p>
<p>of the RNA in the cell.</p>
<p>So we have a very big genome,</p>
<p>and less than 2% of it encodes for this messenger RNA.</p>
<p>However, a lot of the genome is transcribed</p>
<p>to make RNA that does other things.</p>
<p>Some of these RNAs we understand,</p>
<p>and many of them we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a beautiful description,</p>
<p>and IKEA is not a sponsor of the podcast,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s totally fair game to use the IKEA catalog</p>
<p>as the analogy for DNA, the specific instructions</p>
<p>for specific pieces of furniture is the RNA,</p>
<p>and the furniture pieces being the proteins</p>
<p>that are essentially made from RNA using messenger RNA.</p>
<p>Okay, thank you for that.</p>
<p>So despite the fact that the same genes</p>
<p>are contained in all the cells of the body,</p>
<p>there is a difference between certain cell types, right?</p>
<p>I would say, is it fair to say</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s basically one very important exception,</p>
<p>which is somatic cells versus germ cells?</p>
<p>And would you mind sharing with us what that distinction is?</p>
<p>Sure, so yes, every cell type is different</p>
<p>because it expresses, it brings into action</p>
<p>different genes from the entire collection,</p>
<p>and assumes an identity.</p>
<p>And so we have cells in the legs,</p>
<p>we have cells in the brain,</p>
<p>we have cells that produce dopamine,</p>
<p>cells that produce serotonin, and so on.</p>
<p>And we can make different separations,</p>
<p>different distinctions, but we can make</p>
<p>one very important distinction</p>
<p>between the somatic cells and the germ cells.</p>
<p>The germ cells are supposed to be the only cells</p>
<p>that contribute to the next generation,</p>
<p>out of which the next generation will be made.</p>
<p>So each of us is made just from a combination</p>
<p>of a sperm and an egg, these are two types of germ cells,</p>
<p>and then they fuse and you get one fertilized egg,</p>
<p>and out of this one cell,</p>
<p>all the rest of the body will develop.</p>
<p>And what happens in the soma,</p>
<p>which are all the cells that are not the germ cells,</p>
<p>should stay in the soma,</p>
<p>should not be able to contribute to the next generation.</p>
<p>This is very important,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s thought to be one of the main barriers</p>
<p>for the inheritance of acquired traits,</p>
<p>the inheritance of memory, and so on,</p>
<p>because for example, like the example that you gave</p>
<p>with learning architecture,</p>
<p>if I learn about architecture,</p>
<p>the information is encoded in my brain,</p>
<p>and since my brain cells can&rsquo;t transfer information</p>
<p>to the sperm and the egg,</p>
<p>because the information&rsquo;s supposed to reside</p>
<p>in synaptic connections between different neurons</p>
<p>in particular circuits that developed.</p>
<p>So what happens is the brain shouldn&rsquo;t be able</p>
<p>to transfer to the next generation.</p>
<p>Even simpler, a simpler example,</p>
<p>if you go to the gym and you build up muscles,</p>
<p>you know that your kids will have to work out on their own,</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t, this short out won&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>This is something that we know intuitively,</p>
<p>even if we don&rsquo;t have any background in biology.</p>
<p>And this is connected to the fact that,</p>
<p>as we said at the beginning,</p>
<p>every cell in the body has its own genome,</p>
<p>and the next generation will only form</p>
<p>from the combination of the genomes in the sperm and the egg.</p>
<p>Even if you somehow acquire the mutation</p>
<p>or a change in your DNA in one of particular brain cells,</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t matter because this mutation,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way to transfer it to the DNA of the germ cells</p>
<p>that will contribute to the next generation.</p>
<p>So despite that, there is, as you will tell us,</p>
<p>some evidence for inheritance of experience, let&rsquo;s call it.</p>
<p>Or, and here we have to be careful with the language,</p>
<p>right, I just want to put a big asterisk</p>
<p>and underline and highlight that the language</p>
<p>around what we&rsquo;re about to talk about is both confusing</p>
<p>and at the same time, fairly simple and controversial.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s a little bit like in the field of longevity,</p>
<p>people sometimes will say anti-aging,</p>
<p>some people say longevity.</p>
<p>The anti-aging folks feel that longevity</p>
<p>is more about longevity clinics, they don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>Anti-aging is related to some other kind of niche clinics,</p>
<p>sometimes FDA approved or government approved, sometimes not.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot of argument about the naming,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all about living longer and living healthier.</p>
<p>In this field of acquiring traits</p>
<p>or the passage of information to offspring,</p>
<p>what is the proper language to refer</p>
<p>to what we&rsquo;re about to discuss?</p>
<p>There is this idea, and I&rsquo;ll say it</p>
<p>so that you don&rsquo;t have to, that dates back to Lamarck</p>
<p>and Lamarckian evolution, very controversial, right?</p>
<p>And maybe not even controversial,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very like offensive even to certain people,</p>
<p>this idea of inheritance of acquired traits.</p>
<p>The idea that one could change themselves</p>
<p>through some activity, use the example of going to the gym,</p>
<p>we could also use the example of somebody</p>
<p>who becomes an endurance runner,</p>
<p>then decides to have children</p>
<p>with another endurance runner and has in mind the idea</p>
<p>that because they did all this running</p>
<p>and not just because they were biased</p>
<p>towards running in the first place,</p>
<p>but because of the distance they actually ran</p>
<p>that their offspring somehow would be fabulous runners.</p>
<p>Okay, this Lamarckian concept is, we believe, wrong.</p>
<p>So how do we talk about inheritance of acquired traits?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the proper language for us to frame this discussion?</p>
<p>We have to be very careful, as you said,</p>
<p>and there are many complications and many ambiguities.</p>
<p>And maybe you could tell us why Lamarckian evolution,</p>
<p>for those that don&rsquo;t know, is such a stained thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not polite.</p>
<p>Right, perhaps we&rsquo;ll start with just to just say</p>
<p>that we can talk about inheritance of acquired traits,</p>
<p>transmission of parental responses,</p>
<p>inheritance of memory, all of these things.</p>
<p>And we can also talk about epigenetics</p>
<p>and transgenerational epigenetics</p>
<p>and intergenerational epigenetics.</p>
<p>There are many terms that we need to make clear</p>
<p>for the audience.</p>
<p>The reason that is so toxic or controversial</p>
<p>is very complicated and goes a long time back,</p>
<p>even way before Lamarck.</p>
<p>So even the Greeks talked about inheritance of acquired traits.</p>
<p>Lamarck is associated with the term,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s probably a mistake,</p>
<p>although everyone talks about it,</p>
<p>including people who studied.</p>
<p>So Lamarck worked, he published his book</p>
<p>about a little more than 200 years ago.</p>
<p>And he believed in inheritance of acquired traits,</p>
<p>absolutely, but just like anyone else in his time,</p>
<p>just everyone believed in it.</p>
<p>It seemed obvious to them that it was long before Mendel</p>
<p>and the rules of genetic inheritance.</p>
<p>And also Mendel was long before the understanding</p>
<p>that DNA is the heritable material.</p>
<p>So this happened a long time ago.</p>
<p>Everyone believed in it, including Darwin.</p>
<p>Darwin was perhaps more Lamarckian than Lamarck.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re getting into the meat of it.</p>
<p>And this is in the origin of the species.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in all of his writings.</p>
<p>Lamarck didn&rsquo;t even really make the distinction</p>
<p>between the generations.</p>
<p>He had many other reasons for being wrong,</p>
<p>but he connected the terms</p>
<p>inheritance of acquired traits to evolution.</p>
<p>And this is some of the reasons</p>
<p>that he was very controversial, even in his time.</p>
<p>There were other reasons.</p>
<p>For example, he rejected current day chemistry</p>
<p>and thought that he can explain everything</p>
<p>based on Aristotelian fluids, earth, wind, fire, and water.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still some people on the internet</p>
<p>that think they can discard with chemistry</p>
<p>and explain everything based on earth, wind, fire, and water.</p>
<p>And this wasn&rsquo;t only biology.</p>
<p>It was also the weather and everything.</p>
<p>So that was part of the reason.</p>
<p>But Lamarck, so Lamarck made many mistakes,</p>
<p>but he did have a full theory of inheritance,</p>
<p>which was a big step towards where we are today.</p>
<p>So he had important contributions, nevertheless.</p>
<p>Although he was mistaken about the mechanism,</p>
<p>what he believed, like everyone else, drives evolution</p>
<p>is the transmission of the traits</p>
<p>that you acquire during your life</p>
<p>or the things that you do or don&rsquo;t you do.</p>
<p>We talked about use and disuse of certain organs</p>
<p>that shape our organs</p>
<p>and eventually also the organs of the next generation.</p>
<p>He sounds a little bit like</p>
<p>the first self-help public figure, right?</p>
<p>Well, this idea, I mean, this is heavily embedded</p>
<p>into a lot of the health and fitness space</p>
<p>on Twitter and Instagram and on the internet,</p>
<p>which is that, and it&rsquo;s the idea that we&rsquo;re sold</p>
<p>very early in life, at least here in the United States</p>
<p>and probably elsewhere,</p>
<p>which is that we can become anything that we want to become.</p>
<p>And then that will forever change the offspring,</p>
<p>either because of nature or nurture.</p>
<p>Right, and this is a very dangerous idea,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ll explain in a second, and it led to horrible things.</p>
<p>This is part of the reason that this is such a taboo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not only self-help,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re helping or dis-helping yourself.</p>
<p>The problem is when you apply it to others.</p>
<p>And this happened in a very, very dramatic</p>
<p>and horrible way in the recent past,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ll tell in a second.</p>
<p>So Lamarck, this is what he believed.</p>
<p>And he thought this is how evolution progresses.</p>
<p>And later, Darwin showed that it&rsquo;s really natural selection,</p>
<p>the selecting of the people, of the organisms</p>
<p>that already contain the particular qualities</p>
<p>are selected based on whether they survive</p>
<p>or not in particular environments.</p>
<p>And therefore, the evolution progresses.</p>
<p>They become more common and take over.</p>
<p>This is very different, two different explanations.</p>
<p>The most common way this is contrasted</p>
<p>is the neck of the giraffes.</p>
<p>This is the classic example.</p>
<p>According to Lamarck, the giraffes had to stretch</p>
<p>their necks towards the trees to eat</p>
<p>when the trees were high.</p>
<p>And because of that, they transmitted these traits,</p>
<p>long necks to their children who also had long necks.</p>
<p>By the way, he only mentioned this example a handful of times</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t really focus on that.</p>
<p>And according to Darwin, just a giraffe</p>
<p>that happened to be born with a long neck</p>
<p>survived because it ate.</p>
<p>So its genetic, heritable materials,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t know about genetics, but take over.</p>
<p>And the rest of the giraffes</p>
<p>that have different heritable materials just die.</p>
<p>So this is natural selection</p>
<p>versus inheritance for quiet traits.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why Lamarckism</p>
<p>and inheritance for quiet traits became such a bad term.</p>
<p>One of the biggest is what happened in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Under Stalin, there was a scientist called Lysenko</p>
<p>who thought that Mendelianism, normal genetics</p>
<p>is bourgeois science, shouldn&rsquo;t be done.</p>
<p>And whoever did normal genetics was either killed</p>
<p>or sent to Siberia.</p>
<p>And he thought that, just like you said,</p>
<p>not only we can become everything that we want,</p>
<p>but we can grow everything that we want</p>
<p>in every field, can take a frozen field</p>
<p>and grow potatoes there and so on.</p>
<p>And this led to massive starvation,</p>
<p>ruined agriculture in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>also ruined science for many, many years</p>
<p>and put a very dark cloud on the entire field.</p>
<p>And only probably in the 80s or something like this,</p>
<p>the field started to recuperate for that.</p>
<p>Aside for that, which is a very dramatic thing,</p>
<p>there was also crazy stories around</p>
<p>and attempts to prove the inheritance of quiet traits.</p>
<p>Despite the realization of many scientists,</p>
<p>this is something that is very rare</p>
<p>or that normally doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>It is not a normal way that inheritance works.</p>
<p>And I can tell you about two such dramatic cases</p>
<p>that will illustrate it.</p>
<p>Yeah, please.</p>
<p>So in the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna,</p>
<p>there was a researcher called Paul Kammerer,</p>
<p>who was a very famous and also very colorful figure</p>
<p>who did experiments on many different types of animals.</p>
<p>He did experiments on toads</p>
<p>that are called the midwife toad</p>
<p>because the male carries the eggs.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a beautiful book about it</p>
<p>from Kessler telling the story of what happened there.</p>
<p>And there are a couple of types of toads.</p>
<p>Some of them live underwater</p>
<p>and some of them live on land.</p>
<p>And these toads are different in their shape</p>
<p>and in their behavior.</p>
<p>So of course, the capacity to live underwater is one thing,</p>
<p>but also the morphology and appearance changes.</p>
<p>The toads that live underwater</p>
<p>develop these nupital pads,</p>
<p>these black pads on their hands</p>
<p>that allow the males to grab onto the female</p>
<p>without slipping.</p>
<p>Formating.</p>
<p>Formating.</p>
<p>And the ones on land don&rsquo;t have them.</p>
<p>He claimed that he can take the toads</p>
<p>and train them to live underwater,</p>
<p>changing the temperature and all kinds of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very difficult animal to work with.</p>
<p>Eventually, according to Kammerer,</p>
<p>they will acquire the capacity to live underwater</p>
<p>and also change their physiology</p>
<p>and develop these black nupital pads on their heads.</p>
<p>With this discovery, he traveled the world,</p>
<p>became very famous.</p>
<p>And this was in just the beginning of the previous century.</p>
<p>As the person who found the proof</p>
<p>for inheritance of acquired traits,</p>
<p>despite the controversy and so on,</p>
<p>and the beginning of the realization</p>
<p>of how it actually works with DNA and so on.</p>
<p>Not with DNA, but with natural selection.</p>
<p>DNA came later.</p>
<p>And people didn&rsquo;t believe him.</p>
<p>He was actually under a lot of attacks,</p>
<p>but it seemed convincing.</p>
<p>At the end, what happened is that they found</p>
<p>that he injected ink to the toads</p>
<p>to make them become black, to have these nupital pads.</p>
<p>So he faked the results.</p>
<p>And he couldn&rsquo;t stand up with the accusations</p>
<p>and killed himself.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>In this book by Kessler,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just maybe it was the assistant who did it.</p>
<p>Who killed him?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Who injected it to sort of save him</p>
<p>because the samples lost the coloring or something.</p>
<p>So it might be, who knows what happened.</p>
<p>Well, in science, whenever there&rsquo;s a fraud accusation</p>
<p>or controversy, it&rsquo;s not uncommon</p>
<p>to see a passing of responsibility.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>There are recent cases, there are ongoing cases now</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a question of who did what, et cetera.</p>
<p>Actually, I have two questions before the second story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m struck by the idea that he was traveling and talking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing this was before PowerPoint and keynote,</p>
<p>but also before transparencies,</p>
<p>which actually were still in place</p>
<p>when I was a graduate student.</p>
<p>For those of you who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>transparencies are basically transparent pieces</p>
<p>of plastic paper that you put onto a projector</p>
<p>and then you can write on them and do demonstrations,</p>
<p>but can show photographs and things like that.</p>
<p>So how was he giving these talks</p>
<p>and would he travel with the toads?</p>
<p>So he traveled with the samples.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m basing this on this Kessler book,</p>
<p>which is on its own very controversial.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of a beautiful story than perhaps the truth.</p>
<p>But according to the story there,</p>
<p>he had to stand in one side of the lecture hall</p>
<p>with his hands behind the back</p>
<p>while others would examine the samples</p>
<p>and pass them around and so on.</p>
<p>But he cheated.</p>
<p>Someone cheated.</p>
<p>He probably did it.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s what most people think,</p>
<p>but this wasn&rsquo;t replicated.</p>
<p>I mean, also, I don&rsquo;t think anyone tried to replicate it.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>This is just a point about replication.</p>
<p>And actually another tragic example,</p>
<p>not but a few years ago, Sakai,</p>
<p>who was, as far as we knew,</p>
<p>was doing very accomplished work on the growth of retinas,</p>
<p>literally growing eyes in a dish.</p>
<p>I think everyone believes that result,</p>
<p>but then there were some accusations about another result</p>
<p>that turned out to be fraudulent and Sakai killed himself.</p>
<p>This was only about five, 10 years ago.</p>
<p>So it still happens.</p>
<p>Yeah, it happens.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s rare, but it does happen,</p>
<p>especially in this very high profile situation.</p>
<p>I would argue, I&rsquo;d love to know what your number is,</p>
<p>but I would argue that 99% of scientists</p>
<p>are seeking truth and are well-meaning, honest people.</p>
<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>And I think that even when people are wrong,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s mostly not because they&rsquo;re evil</p>
<p>and trying to act,</p>
<p>like maybe they really want to believe the results,</p>
<p>or there are all kinds of ways to be wrong</p>
<p>and even to bend truth without just blatant fraud.</p>
<p>But this is, according to the story,</p>
<p>an example of very bad fraud,</p>
<p>which I agree is rare because most scientists, as you said,</p>
<p>this is also my opinion,</p>
<p>are just trying to discover truth and do the best they can.</p>
<p>Well, why else would you go into it?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s certainly not a profession to go into</p>
<p>if you want to get rich.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the money.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably not even a profession to go into</p>
<p>if you want to get famous.</p>
<p>If you want to be famous,</p>
<p>you should go to Hollywood or become a serial killer</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll make specials about it.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But please don&rsquo;t do either.</p>
<p>No, Hollywood, I suppose for some is fine.</p>
<p>But in any case, okay, so Kammerer around 1907, 1906?</p>
<p>This is slightly before,</p>
<p>the controversy broke out after the First World War.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>So Kammerer is gone, his toads with their either ink</p>
<p>or whatever, nupital pads,</p>
<p>they have to go back to mating on land.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens now called AG1</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health,</p>
<p>our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal</p>
<p>and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number</p>
<p>of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met.</p>
<p>And it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll give you a year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>So this is, forget about that,</p>
<p>we also had the Lysenko episode,</p>
<p>you know, that&rsquo;s a very big thing.</p>
<p>And then in the U.S., there was, in the 70s and 80s,</p>
<p>a researcher named McConnell,</p>
<p>who did very different experiments,</p>
<p>and he was also a character.</p>
<p>He worked on, so he was a joker type of thing,</p>
<p>and he published many of his results in a journal</p>
<p>that he published that was called Worms Breeders Gazette</p>
<p>and had many cartoons and things like that.</p>
<p>So he started his own journal?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one way to publish a lot.</p>
<p>But they also published in very respected journals,</p>
<p>in parallel.</p>
<p>But he was a psychologist, American psychologist,</p>
<p>and he worked on a worm, a flatworm,</p>
<p>which is called planaria, which is very interesting.</p>
<p>This is different than what we&rsquo;ll discuss today,</p>
<p>different type of worm.</p>
<p>You know, worms are very common.</p>
<p>So four out of five animals on this planet is a worm.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yes, numerically, it&rsquo;s just count the individuals.</p>
<p>So we are the exception.</p>
<p>And so, but I&rsquo;ll talk about a very different worm later.</p>
<p>This is a flatworm, this is called planaria,</p>
<p>and it is remarkable in many ways.</p>
<p>It was also a model that many people worked on,</p>
<p>including the fathers of genetics,</p>
<p>people who started genetics like Morgan,</p>
<p>they worked on it in the beginning,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very, very hard to study genetics in this worm</p>
<p>because unlike us, unlike what we explained before</p>
<p>about how we all develop from sperm and an egg,</p>
<p>these worms, most of the time, reproduce just by fission.</p>
<p>They tear themselves apart.</p>
<p>So they have a head and a tail,</p>
<p>and the part of the head would just tear itself apart</p>
<p>from the tail, grow a new, the head will grow a new tail,</p>
<p>the tail will grow a new head.</p>
<p>You can even cut them to 200 pieces,</p>
<p>each piece will grow into a new worm.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And they have centralized brains with lobes and everything,</p>
<p>and even these degenerate eyes.</p>
<p>He studied these worms,</p>
<p>and he said that he can teach them certain things,</p>
<p>associations, by pairing all,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember exactly what he did,</p>
<p>I think it was either lights or electricity with-</p>
<p>Shock them, I think.</p>
<p>Shock them with other things,</p>
<p>and he could train them to learn</p>
<p>and remember particular things.</p>
<p>Like they might get shocked on one side of the tank-</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And then avoid that side of the tank.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And then I guess the question is whether or not</p>
<p>their ripped apart selves and their subsequent generations</p>
<p>will know to avoid that side of the tank</p>
<p>without having ever been exposed to the shock.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So without ever being exposed to shock,</p>
<p>or whether the new generation, the new heads,</p>
<p>will be able to learn faster.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another, the subtlety that you might have, okay?</p>
<p>And this is what he said happened.</p>
<p>He said he can teach them certain things,</p>
<p>remove, cut off their heads,</p>
<p>and new heads with all the brain will grow,</p>
<p>and that it will contain the memory.</p>
<p>This was the start of the controversy,</p>
<p>not the end, only the beginning.</p>
<p>Then he said something even much wilder,</p>
<p>which is he can train them to learn certain things,</p>
<p>and then just chop them up, put them in a blender,</p>
<p>and feed them to other worms,</p>
<p>because they are cannibalistic, they eat each other,</p>
<p>and that the memory will transfer through feeding.</p>
<p>This sounds-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dramatic field.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And by the way, this opened the field.</p>
<p>So people did experiments, then not only in planaria,</p>
<p>but in goldfish and certain rodents,</p>
<p>and did these memory brain transfer assays,</p>
<p>implanting brain, and this is in the,</p>
<p>back when they had an idea</p>
<p>that some memories could be moleculars,</p>
<p>could have a molecular form, which is very appealing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like science fiction.</p>
<p>You could have a memory in a tube.</p>
<p>Unlike the way we think about memory normally,</p>
<p>which is something that is distributed in neuronal circuits,</p>
<p>and encoded in the strength of particular synapses,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>But the idea that you can take a memory</p>
<p>and reduce it into a molecule,</p>
<p>and transfer it around is very, very interesting.</p>
<p>So this is why it attracted so many people.</p>
<p>This ended up in a catastrophe.</p>
<p>So there was an NIH investigation.</p>
<p>No one can replicate anything.</p>
<p>It was a big mess.</p>
<p>Although there were always scientists who said,</p>
<p>yes, we can replicate this and this.</p>
<p>So they were in the background, okay.</p>
<p>McConnell&rsquo;s stuff was different.</p>
<p>Again, people thought that they couldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>that there are problems replicating,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t necessarily, but some people replicate,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t necessarily about replicating the whole thing.</p>
<p>But the question was,</p>
<p>did the memory that transfer is specific,</p>
<p>or is it an overall sensitization that transmits, and so on.</p>
<p>Right, like you could imagine that what gets transmitted</p>
<p>is a hypersensitivity to electricity,</p>
<p>as opposed to the specific location</p>
<p>that the electricity was introduced.</p>
<p>Or even more than that,</p>
<p>even just a hypersensitivity in general,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more vigilant and you&rsquo;ll learn anything so fast.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also a possibility.</p>
<p>But his problem wasn&rsquo;t the accusation,</p>
<p>it was much worse,</p>
<p>that he was targeted by the Unabomber,</p>
<p>this terrorist who sent letters with bombs</p>
<p>to many scientists for 15 years.</p>
<p>And his assistant, again, his assistant,</p>
<p>I think exploded,</p>
<p>and this is how his line of research ended.</p>
<p>Just recently, a few years ago,</p>
<p>a researcher from Boston, Mike Levin,</p>
<p>and his postdoc, Tal Shomrat,</p>
<p>replicated some of McConnell&rsquo;s experiment</p>
<p>with the cutting of the head,</p>
<p>but using very fancy equipment and automated tracking.</p>
<p>And they could say that they can replicate</p>
<p>some of his experiments.</p>
<p>Really? Yes.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t open packages in that laboratory.</p>
<p>They have interesting stories.</p>
<p>You should have Mike over.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m familiar with a bit of his work.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize they had done that experiment.</p>
<p>They published it, yeah, a few years ago.</p>
<p>And this is very interesting,</p>
<p>but of course they don&rsquo;t know how it happens.</p>
<p>The mechanism is unclear.</p>
<p>McConnell went a step further than this.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s fascinating is that these are experiments</p>
<p>that were done in the 70s and 80s.</p>
<p>He said that he can not only transfer the memories</p>
<p>through chopped animals,</p>
<p>but he can take the animal that learns</p>
<p>and break it down into different fractions.</p>
<p>So just the DNA, just the RNA, just the fats,</p>
<p>the proteins, the sugars.</p>
<p>And he said that the fraction that transmit the memory</p>
<p>is the RNA.</p>
<p>And this is very, very interesting</p>
<p>because it was a long time before everything</p>
<p>that we know about RNA today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll soon go into my research, explain what we do.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ll see that you can actually feed worms</p>
<p>with RNA and have many things happen.</p>
<p>No, this is true.</p>
<p>So this is why it was so appealing to go back to that</p>
<p>and study it.</p>
<p>By the way, at the time it became popular knowledge.</p>
<p>Everyone knew these experiments.</p>
<p>There was a Star Trek episode about it from 84.</p>
<p>There are comics books about it, books about it.</p>
<p>So this was very, and people were eating RNA</p>
<p>because they thought that there was RNA in memory.</p>
<p>This was of course complete nonsense.</p>
<p>But this was, it made a lot of noise in these years,</p>
<p>which is part of the reason it was so toxic</p>
<p>until recently.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t touch it because it was considered</p>
<p>pseudoscience, like Lysenko, like Kammerer and all of this.</p>
<p>So this was just something you didn&rsquo;t want to touch at all.</p>
<p>And then we go back to these studies</p>
<p>about the inheritance of memory</p>
<p>or inheritance of acquired traits in other organisms,</p>
<p>in mammals, in humans.</p>
<p>And aside from the dark clouds that these episodes left,</p>
<p>there were also theoretical problems</p>
<p>of why this can&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Barriers that have to be breached for this to happen.</p>
<p>And you can talk about many different types of barriers.</p>
<p>And you can also narrow it down to two main barriers.</p>
<p>First barrier, we mentioned it,</p>
<p>this is the separation of the soma from the germline.</p>
<p>Right, the somatic cells,</p>
<p>they can change in response to experience,</p>
<p>the sperm and the egg, the so-called germ cells cannot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<p>Or they are isolated from what happens in the soma.</p>
<p>The man who first thought about this barrier</p>
<p>is called Wiseman, August Wiseman,</p>
<p>this was in the 19th century.</p>
<p>So it is called today the Wiseman barrier.</p>
<p>Separation of the soma from the germline,</p>
<p>only the germline transmitting from it</p>
<p>to the next generation.</p>
<p>And this is also called the second law of biology.</p>
<p>So this is very, very fundamental.</p>
<p>So natural selection is the first one,</p>
<p>this is the second one,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so important to how we work,</p>
<p>to how our bodies work.</p>
<p>Wiseman, by the way,</p>
<p>thought that if you will have direct influence</p>
<p>of the environment on the germ cells,</p>
<p>then perhaps this could transfer to the next generation.</p>
<p>So he wasn&rsquo;t as strict as his barrier suggests,</p>
<p>but this is not how most people remember it.</p>
<p>Okay, but he thought that this is unnecessary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that natural selection can explain everything.</p>
<p>And he compared to a boat,</p>
<p>which is in the ocean, it is sailing,</p>
<p>and it has a sail open,</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t have to assume that it has an engine.</p>
<p>The wind is blowing,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to assume other things.</p>
<p>The natural selection might be enough.</p>
<p>So this barrier is still standing,</p>
<p>but not entirely.</p>
<p>It is rich in some organisms.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll go into that in a second.</p>
<p>The other barrier is the,</p>
<p>now we have to understand the other barrier,</p>
<p>we have to talk about epigenetics.</p>
<p>We have to define epigenetics and what it is.</p>
<p>And epigenetics is another term</p>
<p>which people misuse horribly,</p>
<p>and say about everything that is epigenetics,</p>
<p>even people from the field.</p>
<p>The word itself,</p>
<p>that the term was defined in the 40s</p>
<p>by Weddington, Conrad Weddington,</p>
<p>and he talked about the interaction between genes</p>
<p>and their products that in the end</p>
<p>bring about the phenotype, or the consequences,</p>
<p>and how genes influence development.</p>
<p>Later, people discovered mechanisms</p>
<p>that change the action of genes,</p>
<p>there are different mechanisms,</p>
<p>and started talking about these as epigenetics.</p>
<p>For example, the DNA is built out of four basic elements.</p>
<p>These are the AT, G, and C, right?</p>
<p>And they can be chemically modified.</p>
<p>So in addition to just the information</p>
<p>that you have in the sequence of the DNA,</p>
<p>you also have this information</p>
<p>in the modification of the basis.</p>
<p>The most common modification</p>
<p>that has been studied more than others</p>
<p>is modification of the letter C of cytosine,</p>
<p>methylation, the addition of a methyl group to this C.</p>
<p>And this can be replicated,</p>
<p>so after the DNA, the cells divide</p>
<p>and replicate their genetic material.</p>
<p>In certain cases also, these chemical modifications</p>
<p>can be added on and replicate and be preserved.</p>
<p>For those who aren&rsquo;t as familiar</p>
<p>with thinking about genes and gene structure</p>
<p>and epigenetics, could we think of these,</p>
<p>you mentioned the four nucleotide bases, C, G, A, D,</p>
<p>but could we imagine that through things like methylation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of like taking the primary colors</p>
<p>and adding, changing one of them a little bit,</p>
<p>changing the hue just slightly,</p>
<p>which then opens up an enormous number</p>
<p>of new options of colored integration?</p>
<p>Absolutely, it&rsquo;s just more combinations,</p>
<p>more ways, more information.</p>
<p>There are the modifications of the DNA,</p>
<p>and also there are the modifications of the proteins</p>
<p>which condense the DNA that are called histones.</p>
<p>So they are also modified by many different chemicals.</p>
<p>Again, methylation is a very common modification.</p>
<p>Even serotonin, the serotonination of histones.</p>
<p>Serotonin.</p>
<p>Right, this is a new paper from Nature</p>
<p>from a few years ago.</p>
<p>Can change DNA.</p>
<p>Not the DNA itself, but the protein that condenses it.</p>
<p>Essentially how, in the analogy I used before,</p>
<p>of how the thread is wrapped around the spool, essentially.</p>
<p>Yes, and this determines the degree of condensation</p>
<p>of the DNA, whether the gene is now more or less accessible</p>
<p>and therefore can perhaps be expressed more or less.</p>
<p>This is one way to affect the gene expression</p>
<p>and bring about the function of the gene.</p>
<p>There are many additional ways, not the only one.</p>
<p>So then, when all of this was starting to be elucidated,</p>
<p>people talked about epigenetics,</p>
<p>they started talking about these modifications.</p>
<p>Forgot the original definition,</p>
<p>and when people said epigenetics,</p>
<p>they talk about methylation and things like that.</p>
<p>And again, to just frame this up so we can imagine</p>
<p>two identical twins, so-called monozygotic twins.</p>
<p>We can go a step further and say that they&rsquo;re monochorionic</p>
<p>and they were in the same placental sac,</p>
<p>because twins can be raised in separate sacs,</p>
<p>slightly different early environments.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say those two twins are raised separately.</p>
<p>One experiences certain things.</p>
<p>The other things, they eat different foods, et cetera.</p>
<p>And there is the possibility through epigenetic mechanisms</p>
<p>that through methylation, acetylation,</p>
<p>serotonin production, et cetera,</p>
<p>that the expression of certain genes in one of the twins</p>
<p>could be amplified relative to the other, correct?</p>
<p>So we know that even totally identical twins,</p>
<p>genetically they&rsquo;re identical,</p>
<p>but they look different and they are different.</p>
<p>We experience, we all experience it.</p>
<p>And this can happen because of these epigenetic changes.</p>
<p>Or it can happen because of other mechanisms,</p>
<p>because genes respond to the environment.</p>
<p>Genes don&rsquo;t exist in a vacuum.</p>
<p>Genes need to be activated by transcription factors</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a whole, there&rsquo;s a lot of machinery</p>
<p>that is responsible for making genes function.</p>
<p>So we are a combination of our genetic material</p>
<p>and the environment, okay?</p>
<p>So when people talk about epigenetics</p>
<p>and talk just about the modification,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also not exactly right.</p>
<p>My definition of epigenetics is inheritance,</p>
<p>which occurs either across cell division</p>
<p>or more interestingly also for this podcast now,</p>
<p>across generations,</p>
<p>not because of changes to the DNA sequence,</p>
<p>but through other mechanisms.</p>
<p>I think this is the most robust definition</p>
<p>that allows you to understand what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>And then again, and then the question is,</p>
<p>if this happens, then what are the molecules</p>
<p>that actually transmit information across generations?</p>
<p>Are they these chemical modifications to the DNA</p>
<p>or to the proteins that condense the DNA,</p>
<p>or are there other agents that transmit information</p>
<p>and which molecules can do it?</p>
<p>And I actually think that the most interesting players today</p>
<p>are RNA molecules, okay?</p>
<p>But before I go into that, I just want to say</p>
<p>that when we talk about the barriers</p>
<p>to epigenetic inheritance</p>
<p>or the barriers to inheritance of acquired traits,</p>
<p>in addition to the separation of the soma from the germline</p>
<p>that we discussed, the other main barrier,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called epigenetic reprogramming,</p>
<p>which is that we acquired our cells,</p>
<p>the genetic material in our cells</p>
<p>acquires all kinds of changes,</p>
<p>these chemical changes, modifications we discussed.</p>
<p>But these modifications are largely erased</p>
<p>in the transition between generations.</p>
<p>So in the germline, in the sperm and the egg,</p>
<p>and also in the early embryo,</p>
<p>most of the modifications are removed</p>
<p>so we can start a blank slate</p>
<p>based on the genetic instructions.</p>
<p>And this is crucial, otherwise, according to the theory,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not clear that&rsquo;s actually true</p>
<p>because in some organisms it doesn&rsquo;t really happen,</p>
<p>we will not develop according to the species</p>
<p>typical genetic instructions.</p>
<p>So to preserve this, we erase all these modifications</p>
<p>and start anew.</p>
<p>And this is in mammals and in humans,</p>
<p>this is largely true,</p>
<p>most of the modifications in the sperm and in the egg</p>
<p>are removed, so about 90% of them.</p>
<p>Some remain, which could be interesting.</p>
<p>So the idea, if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s some advantage to wiping the slate clean</p>
<p>and returning to the original plant.</p>
<p>In the context of the IKEA furniture analogy,</p>
<p>the instruction book is the one that&rsquo;s issued to everybody,</p>
<p>okay, or every cell, right?</p>
<p>Only certain instructions are used for certain cells,</p>
<p>say a skin cell or a neuron or a liver cell</p>
<p>or any other cell for that matter.</p>
<p>Through the course of the lifespan of the organism,</p>
<p>those specific instructions are adjusted somewhat.</p>
<p>Okay, so maybe like IKEA furniture,</p>
<p>sometimes they sent you seven, not eight,</p>
<p>of particular screws,</p>
<p>or they sent you the proper number,</p>
<p>but you put them in the wrong place</p>
<p>and it sort of changes the way</p>
<p>that the thing works a little bit.</p>
<p>Once that, assuming furniture could reproduce,</p>
<p>but here in the analogy of the furniture</p>
<p>as the cell or the organ,</p>
<p>in that mates with another organism,</p>
<p>that needs to be replicated,</p>
<p>and so the idea is to take the instruction book,</p>
<p>go through and erase all the pen and pencil marks,</p>
<p>erase all those additional little modifications</p>
<p>that the owner used or introduced to it,</p>
<p>and return to the original instruction book.</p>
<p>Because if you want to bring back the instruction book,</p>
<p>you want it to have all the potential</p>
<p>to make all the furnitures.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want it to be restricted</p>
<p>to the ones that you made in the particular room.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s essentially the opposite of acquired traits</p>
<p>and characteristics based on your,</p>
<p>what we say in biology, geek speak, lineage-based experience</p>
<p>but what your parents experienced, right?</p>
<p>In some ways, we want to eliminate all that</p>
<p>and go back to just the genes they provided.</p>
<p>Yes, but it&rsquo;s more complicated than that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more complicated than that</p>
<p>because we have some very striking examples,</p>
<p>even in mammals, where some of the marks are maintained.</p>
<p>For example, the classic example is imprinting.</p>
<p>Imprinting is a very interesting phenomena.</p>
<p>The way DNA works is that you inherit a copy</p>
<p>for every chromosome from your mother and your father.</p>
<p>And then you have in every cell of your body,</p>
<p>two copies, if you&rsquo;re a human, of every chromosome.</p>
<p>And then, so every gene is represented twice.</p>
<p>These are called alleles, the different versions</p>
<p>of the genes.</p>
<p>And the thought is that once you, in the next generation,</p>
<p>the two copies that you inherited are equal.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you acquire them</p>
<p>from your mother or from your father, right?</p>
<p>There are some situations where it does matter.</p>
<p>There is a limited number of genes</p>
<p>that are called imprinting genes,</p>
<p>where it does matter whether you inherit it</p>
<p>from your mother or your father.</p>
<p>And this is happening through epigenetic inheritance,</p>
<p>not because of changes to the DNA sequence,</p>
<p>but because of maintenance of these chemical modifications</p>
<p>across generations.</p>
<p>And as I recall from the beautiful work</p>
<p>of Catherine Dulac at Harvard,</p>
<p>that especially in the brain,</p>
<p>there is evidence that some cells</p>
<p>contain the complete genome from mom</p>
<p>or the complete genome from dad.</p>
<p>And it can also switch during your life.</p>
<p>So her work showed that early on in your life,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s different whether you express the maternal</p>
<p>or paternal copy than when you&rsquo;re more mature.</p>
<p>So parents and children take note.</p>
<p>For those of you that are saying,</p>
<p>oh, the child is more like you or more like me,</p>
<p>that can change across the lifespan.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re thinking about your parental lineage</p>
<p>and wondering whether or not you, quote unquote,</p>
<p>inherited some sort of trait from mother or from father,</p>
<p>it can be, of course, both,</p>
<p>or it can be just one or just the other,</p>
<p>which I think most parents tend to see</p>
<p>and describe in their children from time to time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just like the father,</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s just like the mother, for instance.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s important to know that in this situation,</p>
<p>the environment played no role.</p>
<p>This was just whether it passed to mother or the father.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that something that happened</p>
<p>to the mother or the father affected this.</p>
<p>So this is slightly different.</p>
<p>The question is now,</p>
<p>can the environment change the heritable material?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very important to understand</p>
<p>that there is a difference between nurture and nature.</p>
<p>And this is very confusing.</p>
<p>People are, it&rsquo;s a little subtle.</p>
<p>So for example, people tell me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m growing horses for many years,</p>
<p>and I just know that this horse has a particular character.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very different from the other horse.</p>
<p>And so this is epigenetic inheritance.</p>
<p>No, it could be just genetically determined.</p>
<p>Yes, this horse inherited a different set</p>
<p>of genetic instructions.</p>
<p>So it is different.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be about epigenetics.</p>
<p>Epigenetic inheritance means</p>
<p>that the environment of the parents</p>
<p>somehow changed the children.</p>
<p>And there are these two main barriers</p>
<p>that are serious bottlenecks</p>
<p>that we have to think what type of molecule</p>
<p>and how they can be breached.</p>
<p>So one possibility is that it&rsquo;s really this limited number</p>
<p>of chemical modifications that survive,</p>
<p>which is about 10% or so.</p>
<p>That could be very interesting.</p>
<p>Not a small number.</p>
<p>Not a small number, but perhaps, perhaps.</p>
<p>This is one possibility.</p>
<p>The other possibility that there are other mechanisms.</p>
<p>The situation now in humans</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s just really unclear what transmits,</p>
<p>if it can transmit, and which molecule does it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk later about other organisms</p>
<p>where it is a lot more clear.</p>
<p>But in humans and mammals in general,</p>
<p>there are many examples for environments</p>
<p>that change the children.</p>
<p>Whether you need to invoke an epigenetic mechanism</p>
<p>to explain this phenomena, this is unclear.</p>
<p>First of all, because it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>to separate nurture from nurture.</p>
<p>And second, because the mechanism is just not understood.</p>
<p>So there are classic examples.</p>
<p>For in humans, there were periods of famine,</p>
<p>starvation in different places in the world.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, in China, in Russia,</p>
<p>where people did huge epidemiological study</p>
<p>to study the next generation,</p>
<p>and saw that the children of women</p>
<p>who were starved during pregnancy are different.</p>
<p>Different in many ways.</p>
<p>They have different birth weight, glucose sensitivity,</p>
<p>and also some neurological,</p>
<p>higher chances of getting some neurological diseases.</p>
<p>And this has been shown in very large studies.</p>
<p>Is there ever an instance of which starvation</p>
<p>or hardship of some kind, some challenge,</p>
<p>sensory challenge, or survival-based challenge</p>
<p>led to adaptive traits?</p>
<p>Yes, there are in different organisms.</p>
<p>It could be as a result of a trade-off.</p>
<p>So there could be a downside as well.</p>
<p>But for example, there are two examples that come into mind.</p>
<p>One of them is that if you stress male mice</p>
<p>or rats, I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>This is work of Isabelle Mansui in the ETH in Switzerland.</p>
<p>If you stress the males,</p>
<p>you can do it in many different ways.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember exactly how they did,</p>
<p>but you can separate them from their mothers.</p>
<p>You can do social defeat, all kinds of things.</p>
<p>Then the next generations are less stressed.</p>
<p>They show less anxiety.</p>
<p>So the threshold for stress is higher.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I think they have memory deficits</p>
<p>and other metabolic problems.</p>
<p>Which may be an advantage for dealing with stress.</p>
<p>Could be.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any direct evidence of that,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some simmering ideas</p>
<p>that our ability to anchor our thoughts</p>
<p>in the past, present, or future seems very adaptive</p>
<p>in certain contexts.</p>
<p>In other contexts, it can keep us ruminating</p>
<p>and not adaptively present to our current challenges.</p>
<p>Another example is that nicotine exposure.</p>
<p>This is, I think, the work of Oliver Handel</p>
<p>from UMass.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, these are not my studies,</p>
<p>but they improved the tolerance to exposure</p>
<p>to similar drugs in the next generation.</p>
<p>The interesting thing here is that it&rsquo;s very nonspecific.</p>
<p>So you treat them with nicotine,</p>
<p>but then in the next generation,</p>
<p>they are more tolerant to nicotine,</p>
<p>but also to other things, cocaine.</p>
<p>That sort of makes sense to me,</p>
<p>because obviously nicotine activates the cholinergic system,</p>
<p>the dopaminergic system, epinephrine, et cetera.</p>
<p>And you can imagine that there&rsquo;s crossover,</p>
<p>because other drugs like cocaine and amphetamine</p>
<p>mainly target the catecholamines,</p>
<p>the dopamine and norepinephrine.</p>
<p>In this particular study, if I remember correctly,</p>
<p>they show that this happens, this heritable effect,</p>
<p>even if you use an antagonist to block the nicotine receptor.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s something more about clearance of xenobiotics</p>
<p>and hepatic functions that is transmitted</p>
<p>and is very nonspecific.</p>
<p>What I love about all the examples you&rsquo;ve given today,</p>
<p>and especially that one is,</p>
<p>and I hope that people, if you&rsquo;re just listening,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m smiling because biology is so cryptic sometimes.</p>
<p>The obvious mechanism is rarely</p>
<p>the one that&rsquo;s actually at play.</p>
<p>And people always ask, well, why?</p>
<p>Why is it like this?</p>
<p>And I always say, the one thing I know for sure</p>
<p>is that I wasn&rsquo;t consulted at the design phase.</p>
<p>And if anyone claims they were,</p>
<p>then you definitely want to back away very fast.</p>
<p>And there could be so many trade-offs, so many trade-offs.</p>
<p>So for example, we studied,</p>
<p>and also many other people studied,</p>
<p>effects, these are in worms.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll go deep into that in a second,</p>
<p>but to show that when you starve them,</p>
<p>the next generations live longer.</p>
<p>And this, I think, could be a trade-off</p>
<p>with other things like fertility.</p>
<p>So the next generations are more sick and less fertile,</p>
<p>and perhaps because of that, they live longer.</p>
<p>So there could be, it&rsquo;s not necessarily a good thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to draw you off course,</p>
<p>because this is magnificent,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing and splaying out for us here.</p>
<p>But do you recall, there was a few years ago,</p>
<p>it actually ended very tragically.</p>
<p>It was an example, I think it was down in San Diego County.</p>
<p>There was a cult of sorts</p>
<p>that were interested in living forever.</p>
<p>And so they castrated,</p>
<p>the males self-castrated themselves</p>
<p>in the idea that somehow maintaining</p>
<p>some pre-pubescent state</p>
<p>or reverting to a pseudo-pre-pubescent state</p>
<p>would somehow extend longevity.</p>
<p>The idea that sexual behavior somehow limited lifespan.</p>
<p>This has been an idea that&rsquo;s been thrown around</p>
<p>in the kind of more wacky longevity communities.</p>
<p>They also shaved their heads.</p>
<p>They also wore the same sneakers,</p>
<p>but then they also all committed suicide</p>
<p>right as the Hale-Bopp comet came through town.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just, but one example of many cults</p>
<p>aimed at sort of, that obviously was not life extension,</p>
<p>that was life truncation,</p>
<p>but aimed at kind of eternal life</p>
<p>or some sort of through caloric restriction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>This cult also was very into the whole idea</p>
<p>that through caloric restriction, we can live much longer,</p>
<p>which may actually turn out to be true.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s still debated.</p>
<p>Hence all the debate about intermittent fasting, et cetera.</p>
<p>But also it is known that if you overeat, you shorten life.</p>
<p>This is clear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s known that big bodied members of a species</p>
<p>live far shorter lives than the smaller members,</p>
<p>a Great Dane versus a Chihuahua, for instance.</p>
<p>So there is some like sort of shards of truths</p>
<p>in all of these things.</p>
<p>But it seems to me that the real question is like,</p>
<p>what is the real mechanism</p>
<p>and why would something like this exist?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And why questions are very dangerous in biology, right?</p>
<p>Right, but very interesting also.</p>
<p>And so when it comes to metabolic changes and nutrition,</p>
<p>there are numerous examples</p>
<p>where you either overfeed or starve</p>
<p>and get effects in the next generations.</p>
<p>Many of the, sometimes the effects contrast</p>
<p>depending on the way you do this.</p>
<p>And again, these are none of,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t do any of that in mammals,</p>
<p>but people show that you&rsquo;re starving</p>
<p>or overfeeding the mothers or the fathers</p>
<p>changes the body weight of the next generation</p>
<p>and also the glucose tolerance</p>
<p>and also reproductive success.</p>
<p>And so the fact that there&rsquo;s an effect,</p>
<p>that something transmits this is clear.</p>
<p>The question is, how miraculous is it?</p>
<p>And whether you need new biology</p>
<p>and epigenetics to explain it.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>If you affect the next generation,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily has to go</p>
<p>through the oocyte or the sperm</p>
<p>and involves the epigenome.</p>
<p>You change the metabolism of the animal as it develops.</p>
<p>And obviously it will affect it.</p>
<p>When you, for example, starve women that are pregnant,</p>
<p>as happened during this famous starvation studies,</p>
<p>that the baby is already in utero</p>
<p>exposed directly to the environment.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not even a heritable effect.</p>
<p>The baby is itself affected.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a direct effect.</p>
<p>Very interesting, important, and has many implications.</p>
<p>And it will be separate from the genetics.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have to take it into account</p>
<p>to understand what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t require necessarily new biology</p>
<p>and new biology of inheritance.</p>
<p>Not only is the embryo affected,</p>
<p>the embryo while in utero already has germ cells.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s also the next generation, so it&rsquo;s directly exposed.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t need any new biology necessarily</p>
<p>to explain it.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t have has to involve epigenetics</p>
<p>or epigenetics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear to me that in the female fetus,</p>
<p>the total number of eggs that she will someday produce</p>
<p>and potentially have fertilized by sperm exists.</p>
<p>But in males with a 60 day sperm cycle,</p>
<p>leads me to the question, do fetal males,</p>
<p>males as fetuses, living as fetuses in their moms</p>
<p>already start producing sperm</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s the primordial cells that give rise to sperm?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not an expert, so I don&rsquo;t wanna go into the details</p>
<p>of exactly when in mammals,</p>
<p>but yes, exposure of the mother also affect</p>
<p>eventually the transmission of the father,</p>
<p>of genetic information for the sperm&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>And there are also many examples</p>
<p>of just stressing the fathers,</p>
<p>affecting the sperm and affecting the next generation.</p>
<p>There, if you go to the F2 generation,</p>
<p>if you go two generations down the road,</p>
<p>not to the kids, but to the grandkids,</p>
<p>then it is a real epigenetic effect</p>
<p>because you examine something that happens,</p>
<p>although the next generation was never exposed</p>
<p>to the original challenge.</p>
<p>So when we say about epigenetic inheritance</p>
<p>in through the paternal lineage, through the fathers,</p>
<p>we talk about two generations.</p>
<p>And when you go through the mother, it&rsquo;s three generations</p>
<p>to talk about when you need to invoke</p>
<p>some real epigenetic mechanism.</p>
<p>And there the evidence becomes much more scarce in mammals.</p>
<p>There are examples, more or less convincing,</p>
<p>the field is evolving and improving a lot.</p>
<p>So for example, now, many people use the cutting edge</p>
<p>is to use IVS, in vitro fertilization,</p>
<p>or transfer of embryos to make sure</p>
<p>that you actually, it&rsquo;s the heritable information</p>
<p>and not the environment or that it goes through the germline.</p>
<p>So this is something that is being done now.</p>
<p>There are studies-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about the three parent IVF</p>
<p>where they take the DNA from mom, the sperm from dad,</p>
<p>and they take the DNA from mom</p>
<p>and put it into a novel cytoplasm or-</p>
<p>No, not at all.</p>
<p>You just take the sperm and transfer it</p>
<p>and fertilize an egg.</p>
<p>So standard IVF.</p>
<p>Yes, standard IVF.</p>
<p>You can do it in many different ways,</p>
<p>but this idea that you separate the environment</p>
<p>of the mother from the inheritance</p>
<p>or the environment of the father.</p>
<p>And to control and separate nature from nature.</p>
<p>The environment becomes the culture dish.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So the field is improving.</p>
<p>People do experiments that have a higher end,</p>
<p>so more replicates and better controlled.</p>
<p>And there are some examples for effects that transfer.</p>
<p>And it depends who you ask,</p>
<p>whether people believe it or not.</p>
<p>Many geneticists do not believe it.</p>
<p>And many people do believe it.</p>
<p>And it depends on the community.</p>
<p>There are strong resistance for many reasons.</p>
<p>Some of them are justified,</p>
<p>some less justified and are part of the scientific process</p>
<p>and how things work.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a new, it&rsquo;s challenging the dogma.</p>
<p>So this is very interesting on its own.</p>
<p>If you ask psychologists,</p>
<p>many psychologists believe that there&rsquo;s heritable trauma</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>Population geneticists, less so.</p>
<p>So this really depends.</p>
<p>And I think that we are just at a point in time</p>
<p>where we don&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>whether it happens and to what extent.</p>
<p>And we need bigger studies.</p>
<p>Even if you think about normal, just genetic studies,</p>
<p>where people trying to understand the genetic underpinning</p>
<p>of complex traits,</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>anything that involves the brain pretty much.</p>
<p>We now know that you need to study many, many, many people.</p>
<p>So now these big genome wide association studies,</p>
<p>big genetic studies involve hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
<p>No one did an experiment like this for epigenetics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much more complicated</p>
<p>because you need to also take into account the environment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even sure we know how to design such an experiment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very challenging.</p>
<p>So part of the resistance to the idea</p>
<p>is based on theoretical grounds,</p>
<p>because of these barriers</p>
<p>and because of the controversies.</p>
<p>On the other hand,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people really want to believe it.</p>
<p>People really want to believe it</p>
<p>because it sort of gives your life meaning.</p>
<p>If you can change your biology through changing,</p>
<p>of your kids through changing your biology.</p>
<p>So psychologically, I can understand</p>
<p>why many people want this to happen.</p>
<p>Even Schrodinger, the famous physicist.</p>
<p>So he wrote a very important book in 44.</p>
<p>So this was before the double helix</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s called, What is Life?</p>
<p>This is actually a book that drove many physicists</p>
<p>to establish molecular biology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very important.</p>
<p>And he talked about the heritable material.</p>
<p>It also talks about evolution.</p>
<p>And he said, unfortunately,</p>
<p>Lamarckism or inheritance of acquired traits is untenable.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>And he writes, this is very, very sad or unfortunate</p>
<p>because unlike Darwinism or natural selection,</p>
<p>which is gloomy, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what you do.</p>
<p>The next generation will be born</p>
<p>based on the instruction in the sperm and the egg.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t influence it.</p>
<p>Of course, you can give your kids money and education,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t biologically influence it.</p>
<p>You can also, one thing I&rsquo;m fascinated by</p>
<p>for a number of reasons is partner selection.</p>
<p>I mean, in some ways, we think,</p>
<p>oh, we want to find someone who is kind.</p>
<p>That does seem to be, by the way, the primary feature,</p>
<p>at least in the data tell us.</p>
<p>We had David Boss on the podcast of how women select men</p>
<p>that people are kind.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also resource potential.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also beauty or aesthetic attractiveness</p>
<p>in males and females, et cetera.</p>
<p>Male, male, female, female, as the case may be.</p>
<p>But in terms of reproduction,</p>
<p>sperm, egg, male, female, obviously.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re selecting for a number of traits,</p>
<p>but presumably subconsciously,</p>
<p>we are also selecting for a number of traits</p>
<p>related to vigor and the idea</p>
<p>that if we were to have offspring with somebody,</p>
<p>that those traits would be selected for.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And we actually have work on that in nematodes</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll be happy to tell you about in a second</p>
<p>after we-</p>
<p>The dating and the dating.</p>
<p>The dating in worms.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>And where we understand the mechanism</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll go into that in a second,</p>
<p>but or in a few minutes after we dive into the worms.</p>
<p>But yes, the original calculations</p>
<p>of how population genetics work to simplify things</p>
<p>and to do the math,</p>
<p>it was random mating.</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t work like that.</p>
<p>So it complicates things because we know.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s research about potential capacity</p>
<p>to somehow sense immune compatibility and things like this,</p>
<p>which is, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m not an expert on that, but-</p>
<p>Neither am I.</p>
<p>But my understanding is that, of course,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re familiar with the other traits we select for,</p>
<p>like potential nurturing ability.</p>
<p>Whether or not someone is reliable</p>
<p>predicts something about their nurturing ability</p>
<p>and for offspring potentially.</p>
<p>I mean, you can draw lines between these things</p>
<p>without any direct evidence,</p>
<p>but they seem so logical, right?</p>
<p>That somebody kind who might also stick around</p>
<p>or be honest in these kinds of things that it makes sense.</p>
<p>But that one would be selecting</p>
<p>for certain biological traits like immune function</p>
<p>or some other form of robustness that we&rsquo;re not aware of</p>
<p>is, I think, a fascinating, fascinating area of biology.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is where the work in mammals stands.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s also one additional thing to mention,</p>
<p>which is that on top of chemical modifications</p>
<p>to the DNA and the proteins that condense the DNA,</p>
<p>which are called histones,</p>
<p>there are also other mechanisms</p>
<p>that might transmit information,</p>
<p>including transmission between generations of RNA.</p>
<p>And there are different types of RNA,</p>
<p>not just the RNA that we mentioned before,</p>
<p>the messenger RNA, which encodes</p>
<p>for the information for making proteins,</p>
<p>but also other RNAs that regulate gene expression.</p>
<p>And this is, and I think that in recent years,</p>
<p>also in the mammalian field,</p>
<p>RNA as the molecule that has the potential</p>
<p>to transmit information between generation</p>
<p>took center stage.</p>
<p>So I think this is the cutting edge,</p>
<p>and a lot more to understand than know,</p>
<p>but RNA has a lot of potential for doing that,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ll explain soon, but we have to go to worms first.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to just take a brief moment</p>
<p>and thank one of our podcast sponsors,</p>
<p>which is InsideTracker.</p>
<p>InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform</p>
<p>that analyzes data from your blood and DNA</p>
<p>to help you better understand your body</p>
<p>and help you reach your health goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been a believer in getting regular blood work done</p>
<p>for the simple reason that blood work</p>
<p>is the only way that you can monitor the markers,</p>
<p>such as hormone markers, lipids, metabolic factors,</p>
<p>et cetera, that impact your immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>One major challenge with blood work, however,</p>
<p>is that most of the time it does not come back</p>
<p>with any information about what to do</p>
<p>in order to move the values for hormones, metabolic factors,</p>
<p>lipids, et cetera, into the ranges that you want.</p>
<p>With InsideTracker, changing those values</p>
<p>becomes very straightforward</p>
<p>because it has a personalized dashboard that you can use</p>
<p>to address the nutrition-based, behavior-based,</p>
<p>supplement-based approaches that you can use</p>
<p>in order to move those values into the ranges</p>
<p>that are optimal for you, your vitality,</p>
<p>and your longevity.</p>
<p>InsideTracker now includes a measurement</p>
<p>of apolipoprotein B, so-called ApoB,</p>
<p>in their ultimate plan.</p>
<p>ApoB is a key marker of cardiovascular health,</p>
<p>and therefore there&rsquo;s extreme value</p>
<p>to knowing your ApoB levels.</p>

<p>Thank you for that incredible overview</p>
<p>of genetics and RNA and epigenetics,</p>
<p>and it was essentially a survey of this very interesting,</p>
<p>and on the face of it, a complex field,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve simplified it a great deal for us.</p>
<p>In our transition to talking about worms,</p>
<p>I would like to plant a flag in the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>and say that what we are about to discuss</p>
<p>is the first time that anyone on this podcast</p>
<p>has discussed so-called model organisms.</p>
<p>I may have mentioned a fly paper here or there,</p>
<p>or a study on honeybees and caffeine</p>
<p>and flower preference at one point,</p>
<p>but typically that&rsquo;s done in passing</p>
<p>and we quickly rotate to humans.</p>
<p>I know that many, if not most of our listeners,</p>
<p>are focused on humans and human biology and health, et cetera,</p>
<p>but I cannot emphasize enough</p>
<p>the importance of model organisms</p>
<p>and the incredible degree to which they&rsquo;ve informed us</p>
<p>about human health,</p>
<p>especially when it comes to very basic functions in cells.</p>
<p>I mean, one could argue, okay,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s been some debate, telomeres in mice,</p>
<p>did that really lead to the same sort of data in humans?</p>
<p>Okay, there are those cases, certainly,</p>
<p>but model organisms are absolutely critical</p>
<p>and have been and basically inform</p>
<p>most of what we understand about human health.</p>
<p>So before we start to go into the description</p>
<p>about worms per se,</p>
<p>could you just explain to a general audience</p>
<p>what a model organism is, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not modeling,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not posing for photographs, obviously.</p>
<p>What that means</p>
<p>and what some of the general model organisms are</p>
<p>and why you&rsquo;ve selected or elected</p>
<p>to work on a particular type of worm</p>
<p>to study these fascinating topics</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s zero question</p>
<p>also take place in humans at some level.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a real pleasure</p>
<p>and an honor to represent the model organisms here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really happy just for that, it was worth it</p>
<p>because as you said,</p>
<p>model organisms are extremely important</p>
<p>and we learn so much about biology through them.</p>
<p>The model organisms mean that it&rsquo;s an organism</p>
<p>that many people work on.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a community of people that work on.</p>
<p>People study many types of organisms,</p>
<p>but not around every organism.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge community of researchers</p>
<p>that combine sources to create all the resources</p>
<p>and the tools and the understanding that accumulates.</p>
<p>There are just a handful of model organisms</p>
<p>in the short history of the field of biology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so long.</p>
<p>We learned about every aspect of biology through them,</p>
<p>including many important diseases, human diseases.</p>
<p>And these are E. coli bacteria,</p>
<p>phage, which is a virus of bacteria,</p>
<p>flies,</p>
<p>worms that are called C. elegans nematodes.</p>
<p>This is what we study in the lab.</p>
<p>Fish, which are called zebrafish.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a particular-</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And of course there are also model organisms and mouse.</p>
<p>And also plants, important plants.</p>
<p>The most studies, one is the Arabidopsis.</p>
<p>Yeah, and perhaps less so nowadays, but non-human primates,</p>
<p>macaque monkeys, marmoset, squirrel monkeys, mainly.</p>
<p>These, I don&rsquo;t know exactly how the definition is,</p>
<p>but emerging model organisms.</p>
<p>There are many model organisms that are emerging</p>
<p>and there are communities that are formed,</p>
<p>including also around the planaria</p>
<p>that we mentioned before, this flatworm that regenerates.</p>
<p>This is a great model for studying regenerations.</p>
<p>If we could develop new heads, it would be incredible.</p>
<p>And we can learn from these organisms.</p>
<p>And the reason that we can learn a lot also about humans</p>
<p>by studying these animals is that we all evolved</p>
<p>from the same ancestor.</p>
<p>So we share a lot of our functions with them</p>
<p>and also a lot of our genes.</p>
<p>C. elegans, and they have the different model organisms</p>
<p>that have different advantages that serve us.</p>
<p>They sometimes have some things</p>
<p>that are much more apparent in them that we can study.</p>
<p>For example, learning and memory was largely studied</p>
<p>in the beginning in a snail, a plesia,</p>
<p>where many of the discoveries were made</p>
<p>because it has big neurons that you can easily study</p>
<p>and examine.</p>
<p>And yes, snails learn.</p>
<p>Yes, they learn.</p>
<p>Even C. elegans, these nematodes that we study learn,</p>
<p>and they are much simpler than most.</p>
<p>Another important reason to study them, of course,</p>
<p>is you can actually experiment on them.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t do this to humans,</p>
<p>the things that we do to these animals.</p>
<p>And we can change their genes,</p>
<p>do all kinds of things for them.</p>
<p>And in some, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>but in some cases, I think you&rsquo;re going to tell us,</p>
<p>for instance, in C. elegans in particular,</p>
<p>the presence of particular cell types is so stereotyped</p>
<p>that you can look at several different worms</p>
<p>and you can, the community of people that study C. elegans</p>
<p>has literally numbered and named each neuron</p>
<p>so that two laboratories on opposite sides of the world</p>
<p>can publish papers on the same neuron,</p>
<p>knowing that it&rsquo;s the same neuron</p>
<p>in the two different laboratories,</p>
<p>something that is extremely hard to do</p>
<p>in any mammalian model, a mouse, or certainly in humans,</p>
<p>and has posed huge challenges that give great advantages</p>
<p>to studies of things like C. elegans.</p>
<p>Yes, so C. elegans, this is the star now of what,</p>
<p>and this is what we study.</p>
<p>These are nematodes, small worms, round worms,</p>
<p>that are just one millimeter long.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t see them with the naked eye.</p>
<p>You have to look under the scope.</p>
<p>Where do they live in the natural world?</p>
<p>So they used to call them soil nematodes,</p>
<p>but this is not really true.</p>
<p>They are in many places,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re mostly in rotten fruits and leaves.</p>
<p>And you can find them in the ground as well,</p>
<p>but you can also find them,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re free living, so they&rsquo;re not parasites,</p>
<p>but you can sometimes also find them in snails.</p>
<p>But the best way to isolate them is from rotten fruits.</p>
<p>I like the idea that they&rsquo;re not parasites.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of these people that gets a little squeamish</p>
<p>about the notion of parasites.</p>
<p>Yeah, so they&rsquo;re not parasites.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really fun to handle</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re so small and easy.</p>
<p>You just grow them on plates with agar and E. coli bacteria.</p>
<p>This is what they eat in the lab.</p>
<p>You can just pick them with a small wire pick,</p>
<p>move them around and change their genes</p>
<p>and do many things to them.</p>
<p>But they have many advantages for neuroscience</p>
<p>and for studying inheritance.</p>
<p>As you mentioned,</p>
<p>they have always a certain number of cells in the body.</p>
<p>So a coelacanth nematode always has 959 cells in its body.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, okay?</p>
<p>960, not 958.</p>
<p>959, okay?</p>
<p>And out of which 302 are neurons.</p>
<p>Always 302.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge debate now over Twitter</p>
<p>on whether it&rsquo;s 302 or 300.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t want to get into trouble, okay?</p>
<p>But people take this very, very hard.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s 302, but let&rsquo;s not get into it</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ll get into trouble.</p>
<p>Well, we can equilibrate all things here by,</p>
<p>you say 302, granted you&rsquo;re far more informed</p>
<p>in this model organism than I am or ever will be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say 300.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re balanced in terms of partisan politics</p>
<p>in the C. elegans community.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>So, and it&rsquo;s always the same.</p>
<p>And each neuron has a name, like you said.</p>
<p>And not only does every neuron has a name,</p>
<p>many of them, we know what they do.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a few cells that are sensory neurons</p>
<p>that sense particular chemicals.</p>
<p>In certain situations, we&rsquo;ll know that a chemical</p>
<p>will be sensed just by one neuron.</p>
<p>There are other motor neurons and interneurons</p>
<p>and all of that.</p>
<p>We know how many dopamine neurons there are</p>
<p>and serotonin neurons, and we know them all by their name.</p>
<p>Not only that, we know how they are connected</p>
<p>to one another.</p>
<p>We have a map, a connectome, since the 80s,</p>
<p>like a subway map that tells us which neuron</p>
<p>talks with which other neurons.</p>
<p>And it is the same, okay?</p>
<p>It was used to think, people thought that it was</p>
<p>exactly the same between genetically identical neurons.</p>
<p>Now we know that there are slight differences,</p>
<p>but by and large, it is the same.</p>
<p>And we have a map, a roadmap that we can use to study.</p>
<p>The so-called connectome.</p>
<p>The connectome.</p>
<p>Not only that, the worms are transparent,</p>
<p>so we can actually see the neurons fire</p>
<p>using particular tools.</p>
<p>And we can activate genes and silent genes</p>
<p>using optogenetics, like was discussed here on the podcast.</p>
<p>We can make the worms go forward or backward</p>
<p>or lay an egg by shining different waves of light on them.</p>
<p>And so we have very powerful tools</p>
<p>for manipulating the brain.</p>
<p>On top of that, we have great understanding</p>
<p>of the genetics of the worm, of the genome.</p>
<p>This is, coelacanth is the first animal</p>
<p>to have its genome sequenced before humans.</p>
<p>Before that, of course, there were bacteria,</p>
<p>and we know that each worm produces,</p>
<p>each mother produces about 250 babies,</p>
<p>which are almost genetically identical.</p>
<p>So we can, and we know where we grow them.</p>
<p>The environment is very controlled,</p>
<p>so we grow them in the plate with just bacteria.</p>
<p>So we can easily separate between nature and nurture.</p>
<p>And one thing that I wonder about often is generation time.</p>
<p>You know, even though mice are not humans,</p>
<p>mice have certain advantages</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re mammalian species.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do all the magnificent things</p>
<p>that you can do in C. elegans in mice.</p>
<p>But one major issue with mice</p>
<p>is that the generation time is somewhat long.</p>
<p>You pair two mice, they mate,</p>
<p>you get a mouse or litter of mice 21 days later,</p>
<p>it might seem like, okay, that&rsquo;s only 21 days or so.</p>
<p>But if you are a graduate student or postdoc</p>
<p>trying to do a project, I mean,</p>
<p>that can extend the time to do experiments</p>
<p>out three or four years</p>
<p>compared to what you could do in C. elegans.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>This is one of the major advantages.</p>
<p>The generation time in C. elegans is three days, three days.</p>
<p>So you can do hundreds of worm generations in one PhD.</p>
<p>This is very important.</p>
<p>Not only that, every worm will produce hundreds of progeny</p>
<p>that are genetically identical,</p>
<p>so you will have great statistics for your experiments.</p>
<p>And the worms probably don&rsquo;t mind</p>
<p>living on these agar plates,</p>
<p>you know, munching away on E. coli where-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the good life.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s questionable whether or not mice or,</p>
<p>certainly, listen, I&rsquo;m a proponent of well-controlled over,</p>
<p>and as long as there&rsquo;s oversight, animal research.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s necessary for the development of treatments</p>
<p>of diseases that hinder humans.</p>
<p>But it is always a little bit of a kind of a cringe</p>
<p>and go kind of thing when you&rsquo;re dealing with mammals</p>
<p>that are living so far outside their natural environment.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;d be lying if I didn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>that it gets to you after a while.</p>
<p>And if it doesn&rsquo;t get to you,</p>
<p>you kind of have to wonder about your own psyche a bit.</p>
<p>Right, I also think that this is important,</p>
<p>but for me, it&rsquo;s much easier to work on worms.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to, you know, feel bad about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re happy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re happy, and you also, I mean, if a worm dies,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s less painful to the human</p>
<p>than if other more sensitive animals.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would argue, yes, I agree, yeah.</p>
<p>So, yes, so there are many advantages</p>
<p>for studying C. elegans.</p>
<p>And in the worm, we now have very obvious</p>
<p>and clear cut proof</p>
<p>that there is inheritance of acquired traits.</p>
<p>So much so that I don&rsquo;t think that anyone pretty much</p>
<p>in the epigenetic field argues against it.</p>
<p>Well, and in large part,</p>
<p>thanks to you and the work you&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>So could you tell us what was the first experiment</p>
<p>that you did on C. elegans that confirmed for you</p>
<p>that there is inheritance of acquired traits?</p>
<p>Because of course, the best experiments and experimenters</p>
<p>always set out to disprove their hypothesis.</p>
<p>And when the hypothesis survives,</p>
<p>despite all the control experiments</p>
<p>and poking and prodding and attempts to contradict oneself,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s considered a victory.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s one that you have to be,</p>
<p>we all have to be very cautious about enjoying</p>
<p>because of the tendency to want our hypotheses to be true.</p>
<p>So what was the first experiment where you were convinced</p>
<p>that inheritance of acquired traits is real?</p>
<p>The first experiment I did was when I, in my postdoc,</p>
<p>which I did with Oliver Hobart in University of Columbia.</p>
<p>We set to test whether worms can produce</p>
<p>transgenerational, multiple generation resistance to viruses.</p>
<p>Wow, this is a very pertinent topic.</p>
<p>Which is relevant.</p>
<p>And worms, these worms don&rsquo;t have dedicated immune cells</p>
<p>like we do.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have T cells or B cells.</p>
<p>They defend themselves from viruses</p>
<p>very efficiently using RNA.</p>
<p>So in fact, when we started these experiments,</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t any natural virus</p>
<p>that was known to infect C. elegans, which is amazing.</p>
<p>Because viruses are very good,</p>
<p>as we all experience now in infecting.</p>
<p>And the worms are resistant to viruses</p>
<p>because of RNA molecules,</p>
<p>short RNA molecules that destroy viruses.</p>
<p>And these are called small RNAs.</p>
<p>Now we need to discuss them before I explain my experiment.</p>
<p>In 2006, two researchers that were studying C. elegans,</p>
<p>Andrew Fire and Craig Mello got the Nobel Prize</p>
<p>for showing that there is a mechanism that regulate genes</p>
<p>that happens for small RNAs.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;ve shown is that if you inject the worms</p>
<p>with RNA molecules, which are double-stranded,</p>
<p>they lead to the site to, they shut off the genes</p>
<p>that correspond, that match in sequence to this RNA.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of like taking the specific instructions</p>
<p>for the coffee table from your Ikea handbook</p>
<p>and you insert a copy of that into the book.</p>
<p>And in doing so, you prevent the expression of,</p>
<p>you sort of erase the original page.</p>
<p>Perfect explanation, perfect explanation.</p>
<p>And they found that double-stranded RNA,</p>
<p>RNA that has two strands, is what starts the response,</p>
<p>leading to the production of small RNA molecules,</p>
<p>which are the ones that actually find the messenger RNA</p>
<p>and leads to its destruction.</p>
<p>Silence it so you don&rsquo;t get proteins in the end.</p>
<p>For that, they got the Nobel Prize</p>
<p>after people found that this is conserved</p>
<p>in many organisms, including humans.</p>
<p>And now there are now drugs,</p>
<p>this was only in 2006, the Nobel Prize,</p>
<p>the paper was published in 98.</p>
<p>There are now drugs that use this mechanism,</p>
<p>also in humans.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just interject and say that not only</p>
<p>is it a recent discovery and an incredibly important one,</p>
<p>but Andy Fire and Craig Mello are also really nice people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They just happen to be very nice people.</p>
<p>And Craig Mello is an excellent,</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s a kite surfer.</p>
<p>The only time I met him in person was at a meeting</p>
<p>and he had a black eye.</p>
<p>And I thought, okay, wow,</p>
<p>I guess he&rsquo;s also a pugilist or something,</p>
<p>but turns out he had done that kite surfing.</p>
<p>So scientists actually do things other than</p>
<p>go to the laboratory,</p>
<p>Nobel Prize winning scientists, that is.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll let you continue.</p>
<p>Thanks for allowing me to interject.</p>
<p>Yeah, incredible scientists.</p>
<p>And there were also studies in many organisms</p>
<p>on the mechanisms of how this happens.</p>
<p>It is called RNA interference.</p>
<p>RNA interferes in the expression of a gene</p>
<p>in the function of a gene.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also called gene silencing</p>
<p>because these RNAs enforce the silencing of genes</p>
<p>instead of the genes being expressed,</p>
<p>they are silenced and you don&rsquo;t manifest the function.</p>
<p>Already in the first paper that they published about this,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;ve shown the double-stranded RNAs</p>
<p>which leads to the silencing or the control,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve shown two very important things.</p>
<p>One of them is that if you inject the worms</p>
<p>with double-stranded RNA,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t only see the action in the cell that you injected</p>
<p>or in the tissue that you injected,</p>
<p>but you see it all over the worm&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>It spreads.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t exactly clear what spreads,</p>
<p>but it was clear that it spreads.</p>
<p>You see the silencing all over the body.</p>
<p>This includes also the germ cells.</p>
<p>So if you inject the double-stranded RNA</p>
<p>just to somatic cells, even to the head,</p>
<p>you will get also the effect in the germ cells</p>
<p>and in the next generation,</p>
<p>in the immediate progeny, the F1 generation, the kids.</p>
<p>So this was really clear proof that this is inherited.</p>
<p>However, this is just one generation</p>
<p>in these original studies.</p>
<p>Later, they&rsquo;ve shown something</p>
<p>which will immediately remind you</p>
<p>what I told you about with planaria,</p>
<p>that you can just take worms and feed them on bacteria</p>
<p>that produce this double-stranded RNA.</p>
<p>And that the silencing would move</p>
<p>from the site of ingestion from the gut</p>
<p>where the bacteria are eaten to the rest of the body</p>
<p>and also to the next generation.</p>
<p>So before we left,</p>
<p>when I mentioned this cannibalistic experiments</p>
<p>of McConnell with the planaria,</p>
<p>and now you see that it can happen.</p>
<p>And this is not controversial at all.</p>
<p>This is being done routinely every day</p>
<p>by any C. elegans biologist in the world.</p>
<p>Okay, so this has been replicated a million times.</p>
<p>Not only that, you can also feed planaria,</p>
<p>these other worms with RNA.</p>
<p>You can just put it in chopped liver and let them eat it.</p>
<p>And again, this will sign in just throughout the body.</p>
<p>Wild.</p>
<p>Okay, and this is what we do routinely.</p>
<p>Always when we want,</p>
<p>we use this technique to see what genes do.</p>
<p>If we want to see whether a particular gene</p>
<p>is important for a certain behavior or a certain something,</p>
<p>the way to study is to neutralize the gene activity.</p>
<p>And we do it by just introducing the worms</p>
<p>with double-stranded RNA that correspond in sequence,</p>
<p>that match in sequence this gene.</p>
<p>This will lead to the silencing,</p>
<p>this activate the genes activity.</p>
<p>And if then the effect stops,</p>
<p>we know this gene is involved in the function.</p>
<p>And we never want to just examine one worm.</p>
<p>So we feed the mother with double-stranded RNA,</p>
<p>and then we examine all of its children</p>
<p>so we can have the statistics over hundreds of worms</p>
<p>or thousands of worms.</p>
<p>So this is validated and not controversial at all</p>
<p>and totally routine.</p>
<p>Is it fair to say that McConnell&rsquo;s experiments</p>
<p>of chop blending up these worms,</p>
<p>the graphic image, blending up these worms</p>
<p>and then feeding them to other worms, planaria,</p>
<p>that those experiments can, yes,</p>
<p>be explained by double-stranded RNA</p>
<p>and through RNA interference?</p>
<p>Potentially.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t been done yet.</p>
<p>We are working on it in my lab now</p>
<p>in collaboration with other labs,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t published.</p>
<p>But yes, this could be the explanation.</p>
<p>So Fio and Melo did these experiments.</p>
<p>Some other people did these experiments.</p>
<p>When I started my work,</p>
<p>I wanted to see whether in addition</p>
<p>to artificial double-stranded RNA,</p>
<p>some natural traits can also transmit across generations</p>
<p>because of RNA, because of small RNAs.</p>
<p>Right, because injecting RNAi</p>
<p>or shorter-interfering RNAs, that is,</p>
<p>or putting worms into an environment</p>
<p>with an abundance of inhibitory RNAs</p>
<p>as an experiment is very different</p>
<p>than worms experiencing something</p>
<p>and then passing on that acquired trait</p>
<p>to their offspring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a world apart, in my opinion,</p>
<p>because one is an extreme manipulation</p>
<p>that illustrates an underlying principle.</p>
<p>The other is something that, in theory,</p>
<p>occurs in the passage of generations just naturally.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going from the less artificial</p>
<p>to the more artificial.</p>
<p>The advantages, just like with model organisms,</p>
<p>that the more artificial it is,</p>
<p>the easier it is to, you know exactly what you did.</p>
<p>Just now introduce one factor</p>
<p>and you can follow the result.</p>
<p>So this is always the trait.</p>
<p>What I did was, in Oliver&rsquo;s lab,</p>
<p>is to see whether the magic,</p>
<p>part of the magic for the worms&rsquo; resistance to viruses</p>
<p>is their capacity to transmit information</p>
<p>in the form of RNA molecules,</p>
<p>inhibitory RNA molecules, to the next generations.</p>
<p>And it has been shown before in C. elegans</p>
<p>that the worms resist viruses using this mechanism,</p>
<p>these small RNAs, okay?</p>
<p>In fact, this is probably the reason</p>
<p>that these small RNAs evolved in the first place,</p>
<p>to get rid of viruses</p>
<p>and other parasitic genomic elements.</p>
<p>And this is a mechanism to fight them.</p>
<p>And what I did is a very simple experiment.</p>
<p>I took worms and I infected them with a virus.</p>
<p>When you do this, this also has been shown in the past,</p>
<p>the worms destroy the virus, okay?</p>
<p>We demonstrated this very clearly using a fluorescent virus.</p>
<p>So if the virus replicates successfully,</p>
<p>the worms just turns green.</p>
<p>And if the virus is destroyed, the worm stays black.</p>
<p>This is very simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a clear cutoff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not this, you don&rsquo;t examine the worm</p>
<p>and ask whether it feels good.</p>
<p>You just see this green light.</p>
<p>Binary response.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And so we took worms,</p>
<p>we infected them with the fluorescent virus,</p>
<p>they destroyed.</p>
<p>This also has been done in the past.</p>
<p>But then what we did is we neutralized the machinery</p>
<p>that makes small RNAs in the descendants of the worms.</p>
<p>So they cannot make small RNAs from the start on their own,</p>
<p>because they just don&rsquo;t have the genes</p>
<p>that you need to make these small RNAs, okay?</p>
<p>And then we ask, what will happen</p>
<p>when we infect these worms with the virus?</p>
<p>Will they be green or black?</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t make their own small RNAs,</p>
<p>so they can&rsquo;t protect themselves on their own.</p>
<p>The only way for them to stay black,</p>
<p>for them not having the virus replicate,</p>
<p>is if they inherit the small RNAs from their parents.</p>
<p>And this is exactly what happens.</p>
<p>All the worms&rsquo; progeny,</p>
<p>although they don&rsquo;t have the gene</p>
<p>that is needed for making the small RNAs, are black.</p>
<p>They silence the virus.</p>
<p>And this also continues for additional generations, okay?</p>
<p>So the parent worms effectively put something</p>
<p>into the genetic instructions of the offspring</p>
<p>that would afford them,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call it an advantage in this case,</p>
<p>but afford them an advantage</p>
<p>if they were to be confronted</p>
<p>with the same thing that the parents were.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And we know exactly what this advantage is.</p>
<p>The advantages are small RNAs that match the viral genome</p>
<p>and just chop up the virus in the next generation.</p>
<p>And we can identify these small RNAs</p>
<p>in the inhibitory RNAs in the descendants,</p>
<p>although they don&rsquo;t have the machinery to make it,</p>
<p>just because they inherit it.</p>
<p>We can identify them by sequencing, by RNA sequencing,</p>
<p>which is like DNA sequencing.</p>
<p>You actually get the actual sequence of the RNA molecules.</p>
<p>And we can see that they correspond to the virus</p>
<p>and they inherit these small RNAs</p>
<p>only if their parents were infected with them.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s specificity there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s specificity.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not some just general resilience passage.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I have to be careful in drawing an analogy</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t correct.</p>
<p>And I want to acknowledge that what I&rsquo;m about to say</p>
<p>with certainty cannot be entirely correct.</p>
<p>But the analogy that comes to mind in mammals</p>
<p>is this idea that if one generation is stressed,</p>
<p>that their offspring may, in some cases,</p>
<p>have a higher stress threshold, resilience to stress.</p>
<p>I could imagine why that would be advantageous, right?</p>
<p>Your parents have a hard life, they have offspring,</p>
<p>and they want their children</p>
<p>to have a higher threshold to stress</p>
<p>because stress can inhibit reproduction, et cetera.</p>
<p>And I always say, you know, at the end of the day</p>
<p>and at the end of life,</p>
<p>evolution is about the offspring, not about the parents.</p>
<p>And every species pretty much seems to want</p>
<p>to make more of itself and protect its young</p>
<p>one way or another, either through nature or through nurture.</p>
<p>This is a nature-based protection of young.</p>
<p>Is it fair to say that in the mammalian experiment</p>
<p>with a passage of stress resilience,</p>
<p>that it could be RNA-based,</p>
<p>that that would perhaps set some new threshold</p>
<p>on glucocorticoid production?</p>
<p>Here I&rsquo;m speculating,</p>
<p>and I want to highlight that I&rsquo;m speculating,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m speculating with a reason,</p>
<p>which is I think for people</p>
<p>that are hearing about this in worms,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve done a beautiful job of splaying out</p>
<p>why model organisms are really important,</p>
<p>but to think about how this may operate</p>
<p>in the passage of human generations</p>
<p>I think is a reasonable thing to entertain.</p>
<p>Right, and it is true that also in mammals,</p>
<p>now RNAs and small RNAs are a lending candidate</p>
<p>for something that could mediate</p>
<p>the transmission of stress protection</p>
<p>or also harmful effects that transmit between generations.</p>
<p>Perhaps RNA do it.</p>
<p>However, in worms, the RNAs have one more trick</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t know the equivalent in mammals yet.</p>
<p>This is something very crucial</p>
<p>that we showed in that particular paper</p>
<p>Which is?</p>
<p>So the effect that I described,</p>
<p>this transmission of resistance to viruses</p>
<p>through these RNAs doesn&rsquo;t only affect the next generation.</p>
<p>It also affects multiple additional generations.</p>
<p>So it gets passed.</p>
<p>It gets passed, and you have to ask yourself,</p>
<p>how doesn&rsquo;t it get diluted?</p>
<p>Why isn&rsquo;t it diluted, right?</p>
<p>Because, I mean, everyone produces 250 babies.</p>
<p>So you dilute by 250,</p>
<p>and if something is diluted for four generations,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s 250 times 250.</p>
<p>After four generations, it&rsquo;s a dilution of four billions.</p>
<p>Completely homeopathic would never work, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, there&rsquo;s nothing left.</p>
<p>The secret of these worms is that they have a machinery</p>
<p>for amplifying the small RNAs in every generation, okay?</p>
<p>This is called RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complex which uses the RNA to find,</p>
<p>and once it finds the messenger RNA,</p>
<p>it just creates many, many, many, many smaller RNAs.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t get diluted,</p>
<p>and they pass on for additional generations, okay?</p>
<p>And this is the trick.</p>
<p>We later also identify genes that regulate</p>
<p>for how long an effect would last.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if in the beginning we ask,</p>
<p>how doesn&rsquo;t it stop after one generation?</p>
<p>Now we have to ask, why doesn&rsquo;t it last forever?</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Typically, we see that the responses last</p>
<p>not only with the viral resistance,</p>
<p>but also with other traits for a few generations,</p>
<p>three to five generations.</p>
<p>We found genes that function as a sort of a clock</p>
<p>that times the duration of the inheritance.</p>
<p>What sorts of genes are those?</p>
<p>So we call these genes MOTEC genes.</p>
<p>MOTEC, I don&rsquo;t know how is your Hebrew,</p>
<p>but MOTEC, it means sweetheart in Hebrew.</p>
<p>But the acronym is Modified Transgenerational</p>
<p>Epigenetic Kinetics.</p>
<p>There are different types of genes like that.</p>
<p>And some of them, if you mutate,</p>
<p>if you disrupt their function,</p>
<p>now the effect would transmit stably</p>
<p>for hundreds of generations.</p>
<p>It would never stop.</p>
<p>Because their role is to stop the inheritance</p>
<p>from just, you don&rsquo;t wanna carry over something forever.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it will no longer fit</p>
<p>the environment of the parents,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be prepared for the wrong things.</p>
<p>So this is important.</p>
<p>There are, what type of genes are they?</p>
<p>One gene that we studied, it&rsquo;s called MET2.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a gene that functions in methylation</p>
<p>of the proteins that condense the DNA.</p>
<p>So this is, but then there are other genes</p>
<p>that affect also production of smaller RNAs.</p>
<p>Is there some mechanism that controls</p>
<p>the duration of passage in a way that logically links up</p>
<p>with the lifespan of the organism?</p>
<p>So for instance, I knew my grandparents.</p>
<p>I met them.</p>
<p>I did not ever meet my great-grandparents.</p>
<p>And I certainly didn&rsquo;t meet my great-great-grandparents.</p>
<p>I could imagine that my great-great-grandparents</p>
<p>or my great-grandparents experienced certain things</p>
<p>that were passed into their children</p>
<p>and perhaps into their children.</p>
<p>But it seems reasonable given that humans live somewhere</p>
<p>between zero and 100 years, typically what now, 80 years?</p>
<p>Is that the typical lifespan?</p>
<p>More or less, okay?</p>
<p>That if I were going to design the system,</p>
<p>and again, I was not consulted at the design phase,</p>
<p>I would want an adaptive trait</p>
<p>to be passed for two generations,</p>
<p>because given how long our species lives</p>
<p>and certainly given the way the world looks now</p>
<p>as opposed to the turn of the previous century</p>
<p>or the turn of the previous century,</p>
<p>different stressors, different life environments,</p>
<p>and what I would want to pass on to my offspring,</p>
<p>I can basically hedge pretty well.</p>
<p>I can place a good bet on the next 100 years,</p>
<p>maybe the next 200, but I don&rsquo;t have the foggiest clue</p>
<p>what the world is going to look like in 300 years.</p>
<p>Does what I&rsquo;m saying make any sense whatsoever?</p>
<p>It makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>And really, we need to talk about two things</p>
<p>in response to this question.</p>
<p>First of all, yes, you can imagine</p>
<p>that the reason that the worms inherit typically</p>
<p>for three to five generations is that this is relevant</p>
<p>to something that happened in their environment.</p>
<p>For example, we also show that when you starve the worms,</p>
<p>it affects the next generations,</p>
<p>again, for a few generations.</p>
<p>Which itself is amazing.</p>
<p>I just want to highlight that.</p>
<p>I mean, you can imagine next generation</p>
<p>is sort of like a genetic version of be careful, kids,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to give you this extra lunch pack</p>
<p>in your genome that protects you</p>
<p>against the possibility of starvation.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also saying, and were you to have kids,</p>
<p>they have it also.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I have to just make a disclaim</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t know that necessarily it&rsquo;s adaptive.</p>
<p>It could also be damaged.</p>
<p>As I said, when you starve them,</p>
<p>the next generations live longer,</p>
<p>but this could be a trade-off for fertility or something.</p>
<p>So other labs have also shown, following our work,</p>
<p>that if you starve the worms,</p>
<p>the next generations are also more resistant</p>
<p>to harsher starvation.</p>
<p>This sounds, this is not our work,</p>
<p>but this sounds adaptive, okay?</p>
<p>But whenever you&rsquo;re talking about adaptation,</p>
<p>you have to see it in the context of evolution.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also this famous saying,</p>
<p>nothing in biology makes sense</p>
<p>except in the light of evolution.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s very hard to say</p>
<p>without doing the lab evolution experiments,</p>
<p>we actually see who wins, the ones that inherit</p>
<p>or the ones that don&rsquo;t inherit, who takes over.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it&rsquo;s hard to talk about</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s adaptive or not.</p>
<p>But when it comes to the duration of the response,</p>
<p>yes, it could be programmed to fit something.</p>
<p>For example, if you&rsquo;re talking about starvation,</p>
<p>worms transition between periods of starvation</p>
<p>and periods where they have a lot of food.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say they find an apple.</p>
<p>For a few generations, they will consume the apple</p>
<p>and then they will be starved for a while.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the number of generations</p>
<p>that takes them to finish an apple.</p>
<p>Or perhaps there are other responses</p>
<p>also to higher temperatures.</p>
<p>If you grow worms in higher temperatures,</p>
<p>the offsprings are different.</p>
<p>They change how they mate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what I alluded to before.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna get back to this</p>
<p>because it relates to cold exposure,</p>
<p>which many listeners are interested in.</p>
<p>And perhaps it is somehow correlated</p>
<p>with the cycle of the year.</p>
<p>But to tell you the truth, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>As I said, we go from the more artificial</p>
<p>to the less artificial.</p>
<p>If double-stranded RNA, just synthetic RNA,</p>
<p>is the most artificial, starvation is more natural,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not starvation in the real context of the world,</p>
<p>in a real apple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a plate with or without E. coli bacteria.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an apple on a tree exposed to the elements</p>
<p>with other worms, with bacteria,</p>
<p>with all kinds of complications.</p>
<p>And it could be that we will see</p>
<p>different durations of heritable effects</p>
<p>the more natural we go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just much less controllable and hard to do.</p>
<p>And again, when we&rsquo;re talking about humans,</p>
<p>part of the argument why people,</p>
<p>why the disbelievers, it&rsquo;s not about faith.</p>
<p>The critics say that this wouldn&rsquo;t happen in humans</p>
<p>is they say, the worms generation time is just three days.</p>
<p>The chances that the parents&rsquo; environment will match</p>
<p>the children&rsquo;s environment is very high</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s not a lot of time</p>
<p>for the environment to change it,</p>
<p>plus they can go very far, they&rsquo;re small.</p>
<p>There are many examples of epigenetic inheritance in plants.</p>
<p>This is a big field where there are very established proof</p>
<p>for inheritance of acquired traits,</p>
<p>for epigenetic inheritance.</p>
<p>Be more careful, epigenetic inheritance</p>
<p>requires more loaded time.</p>
<p>But in plants, it also happens.</p>
<p>And then you also say these are sessile organisms,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t run away, so the environment is more constant.</p>
<p>Well, ideas, maybe just a quick example</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve heard before, tell me if I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>I very well may be.</p>
<p>For instance, a particular species of plant</p>
<p>that grows a straight, maybe slightly bended stalk</p>
<p>might be exposed to some environment</p>
<p>where in order to capture enough sunlight</p>
<p>and other nutrients, might need to grow</p>
<p>in a corkscrew form.</p>
<p>The corkscrew form can be inherited several generations.</p>
<p>This is an example that I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but perhaps it-</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>I seem to, someone will tell, trust me,</p>
<p>the one thing we know about podcasting and YouTube</p>
<p>is someone will tell us in the comments.</p>
<p>And please do, we invite that.</p>
<p>Right, but there&rsquo;s a long history</p>
<p>of epigenetic inheritance studies in plants</p>
<p>with excellent studies, well-controlled,</p>
<p>showing that it happens also there.</p>
<p>So this is very clear.</p>
<p>When it comes to humans, you could say,</p>
<p>maybe my kids will go off to live in a different continent</p>
<p>and they will be on the computer every day</p>
<p>and everything will be different.</p>
<p>So it makes less sense to prepare them</p>
<p>for the same hardships that I experienced.</p>
<p>However, this, in my opinion, this argument comes a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the best argument</p>
<p>because it depends on the scale of how you look at things.</p>
<p>We experience, we meet, for example,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that this is inherited, but in humans,</p>
<p>but we experience the same pathogens</p>
<p>and the same viruses all the time.</p>
<p>So perhaps it is worth preparing for them.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not saying that it happens,</p>
<p>but it depends on the scale.</p>
<p>Well, what you&rsquo;re describing makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>And I do want to acknowledge these critics,</p>
<p>whoever they may be.</p>
<p>I do have the advantage</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t work in this exact field.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m happy to stand on toe-to-toe</p>
<p>with those critics now and say that,</p>
<p>at least in terms of an inheritance of reactions</p>
<p>or adaptive or maladaptive traits to stress or to reward.</p>
<p>You talked about nicotine before,</p>
<p>passage of response to drugs of different kinds,</p>
<p>not being specific to nicotine.</p>
<p>It was sort of a more general passage</p>
<p>of some sort of information related to reactions</p>
<p>to chemicals present in nicotine, but other drugs.</p>
<p>I have long been irritated and a little bit tickled</p>
<p>by the fact that people say,</p>
<p>oh, you know, we have this system for stress</p>
<p>that was really designed to keep us safe</p>
<p>from lions and saber-toothed tigers.</p>
<p>Sure, but the hallmark of the stress system</p>
<p>is that it generalizes.</p>
<p>I mean, if I get a troubling text message</p>
<p>or if I suddenly see a dark figure in the hallway</p>
<p>when I go to the bathroom at night that I don&rsquo;t recognize,</p>
<p>both of those have the same generic response,</p>
<p>which is the deployment of adrenaline</p>
<p>in both brain and body,</p>
<p>changes in the optics of the eyes,</p>
<p>quickening of the heart rate.</p>
<p>Stress is by design generic.</p>
<p>And so one could imagine that a passage</p>
<p>of some sort of stress resilience</p>
<p>or a maladaptive passage to stress</p>
<p>would be also somewhat generic,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s actually advantageous overall.</p>
<p>Same thing with the reward system.</p>
<p>We essentially have one or two chemical systems of reward.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s the opioid system</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s the cannabinoid system,</p>
<p>but in large part, anticipation and reward</p>
<p>is governed by the dopamine circuits.</p>
<p>And anticipation and reward of an ice cream cone for a kid</p>
<p>is the same neural circuitry</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be repurposed</p>
<p>when they get to reproductive age</p>
<p>and they are anticipating creating children with their mate</p>
<p>and assuming they want to do that,</p>
<p>the dopaminergic system is going to be engaged.</p>
<p>So ice cream, sex,</p>
<p>stress to weather, stress to famine,</p>
<p>the biology of these more modal systems,</p>
<p>especially in the nervous system are,</p>
<p>again, I have to be careful with the words by design,</p>
<p>are certainly generic.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t see the need for immense specificity.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not like where COVID just happened.</p>
<p>So could you imagine that there&rsquo;s the passage</p>
<p>of a COVID-19 specific resilience?</p>
<p>No, I think what would probably be passed along</p>
<p>would be some sort of, if it does occur,</p>
<p>would be some sort of resilience to viruses more generally,</p>
<p>and that would be advantageous.</p>
<p>Right, so I agree.</p>
<p>And this opens the question</p>
<p>of what is the bandwidth of inheritance?</p>
<p>How specific can it be</p>
<p>that it makes sense for it to be specific?</p>
<p>And in the case of C. elegans,</p>
<p>the response can be very specific</p>
<p>through this inheritance of RNAs,</p>
<p>which are just sequence specific.</p>
<p>They downregulate, they control one particular gene, okay?</p>
<p>In other cases, it could be a very general response.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very interesting to think about it</p>
<p>when we talk about inheritance of memories,</p>
<p>which is the most interesting thing we could imagine.</p>
<p>Can brain activity of some sort transmit,</p>
<p>at least in these worms?</p>
<p>I said, Noah, I said this disclaimer multiple times,</p>
<p>in mammals, we don&rsquo;t know, times will tell.</p>
<p>In worms, we know a lot.</p>
<p>So can worms transmit brain activity to,</p>
<p>do they have the specificity to do it, okay?</p>
<p>Before I say that, I just say that we, over the years,</p>
<p>learned a lot about the mechanisms</p>
<p>that shuttle the RNAs between generations.</p>
<p>We know about genes that are needed just for that.</p>
<p>About worms, it would be perfectly okay,</p>
<p>but just don&rsquo;t have the capacity</p>
<p>to transfer the RNAs to the next generations.</p>
<p>We know about genes that will make the responses</p>
<p>longer or shorter.</p>
<p>We know about genes that prevent the transfer of RNA</p>
<p>between different tissues.</p>
<p>About genes that make certain small RNAs.</p>
<p>So we know a lot about that.</p>
<p>And then the question arises, we can finally ask,</p>
<p>can memory transfer between generation?</p>
<p>I think that, first of all,</p>
<p>we need to define memory for this.</p>
<p>And the broadest definition would be,</p>
<p>any change in your behavior</p>
<p>because of what happened in the past,</p>
<p>or in your response because of what happened in the past,</p>
<p>or because of your history.</p>
<p>The more interesting part, of course,</p>
<p>is to talk about memories that are encoded in the brain.</p>
<p>And the reason is that the brain is capable</p>
<p>of holding much more specific and elaborate memories.</p>
<p>Then I think that any tissues that transmit transfer,</p>
<p>to transmit RNA to the next generation</p>
<p>and affect the next generation is interesting.</p>
<p>The gut, muscles, everything.</p>
<p>But the brain can synthesize information</p>
<p>about the environment and about internal state,</p>
<p>and can also think ahead.</p>
<p>And the most provocative thing you can say</p>
<p>is that you could plan how, somehow,</p>
<p>the fate of your next generation using your brain,</p>
<p>after taking many things into the code.</p>
<p>This is the most-</p>
<p>Without talking to them.</p>
<p>Right, without talking to them.</p>
<p>And instruction, so it&rsquo;s, again,</p>
<p>we go back to this instruction manual.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like writing something into the instruction manual</p>
<p>based on your own experience.</p>
<p>Right, and can it happen?</p>
<p>Okay, and what is the bandwidth?</p>
<p>Can we transfer specific things?</p>
<p>And then I have to agree with you</p>
<p>that I would imagine that what can transfer,</p>
<p>and I could be wrong,</p>
<p>is a general something, sensitivity.</p>
<p>You can make the analogy to being inflamed or not.</p>
<p>Hypersensitive to pathogens,</p>
<p>hypervigilant, something like this, okay?</p>
<p>But it can also be something very specific.</p>
<p>Now we have to understand that the brain</p>
<p>uses a different language</p>
<p>than the language of inheritance.</p>
<p>The brain, the way we normally think about the brain</p>
<p>is that it keeps information in synapses,</p>
<p>in the connection between different neurons.</p>
<p>When you learn something,</p>
<p>you make some connections stronger</p>
<p>and other connections weaker,</p>
<p>and you wire the nervous system in a different way.</p>
<p>The information in the brain is synaptic,</p>
<p>and it is in the connections.</p>
<p>On the other hand,</p>
<p>heritable information of any sort</p>
<p>has to go through a bottleneck of one cell,</p>
<p>the fertilized egg,</p>
<p>because we all start from just one cell.</p>
<p>So it cannot be in the connections</p>
<p>because this cell doesn&rsquo;t have any connections</p>
<p>with other cells, they&rsquo;re alone.</p>
<p>So heritable information has to be molecular,</p>
<p>it has to be inside this one cell.</p>
<p>So the question is,</p>
<p>can you or do you translate the information,</p>
<p>this 3D structure information of synapses</p>
<p>and the connection between brains</p>
<p>in the architecture of the brain?</p>
<p>Can you somehow translate it to heritable information</p>
<p>to a molecular form?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredibly important and deep question.</p>
<p>It brings to mind something that was once told to me,</p>
<p>which as soon as I heard it was obvious,</p>
<p>but was very important</p>
<p>in formulating my understanding of biology,</p>
<p>which is that a map</p>
<p>is just the transformation of one set of points</p>
<p>into another set of points, right?</p>
<p>So a map of the world essentially is just,</p>
<p>you take what&rsquo;s been drawn out</p>
<p>in terms of the architecture and the coastlines, et cetera,</p>
<p>and divisions between states,</p>
<p>and you transfer that to an electronic map</p>
<p>or a piece of paper.</p>
<p>Seems so obvious, it&rsquo;s sort of a duh,</p>
<p>why are we talking about this?</p>
<p>But just to make sure that people understand</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re really talking about is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say the memory,</p>
<p>and I have a very distinct memory</p>
<p>for my childhood phone number.</p>
<p>Phone number doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore.</p>
<p>And I won&rsquo;t give it out</p>
<p>because then some other person might get irritated</p>
<p>with repeated calls.</p>
<p>But in any case, I remember it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s totally useless information,</p>
<p>but it lives in my neocortex or my hippocampus</p>
<p>or somewhere as a series of connections between neurons</p>
<p>at the locations as you call synapses.</p>
<p>Would my grandchildren know that phone number?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason for them-</p>
<p>Absolutely no.</p>
<p>No, right?</p>
<p>Would my children know that</p>
<p>unless there was some adaptive reason</p>
<p>or some other reason for them to know,</p>
<p>and this passage of acquired traits.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re saying is,</p>
<p>in order for that to happen,</p>
<p>there has to be a transformation of the neural circuit,</p>
<p>literally the wiring of neuron A, B, C, D</p>
<p>that relates and carries the information of that number</p>
<p>into the kind of nucleotide sequences</p>
<p>that are contained in DNA or patterns of methylation</p>
<p>or RNA, more likely.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the transformation of one set of points</p>
<p>in physical space to a translation of points</p>
<p>in genetic space.</p>
<p>Right, and then we have many problems.</p>
<p>First of all, we don&rsquo;t know of a mechanism</p>
<p>to translate between the two different languages,</p>
<p>the language of the brain and the language of inheritance.</p>
<p>We are not familiar with a mechanism like that.</p>
<p>Second, the next generation, if it&rsquo;s not a worm,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a mammal, would have a different brain.</p>
<p>Even if it was genetically identical to the parent,</p>
<p>the wiring of the brain</p>
<p>and the particular neuronal circuits will be different.</p>
<p>This is true for twins.</p>
<p>It will always be true because it depends,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s partially random</p>
<p>and it depends on the environment,</p>
<p>even if you have the same genetic instructions.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you somehow had a mechanism,</p>
<p>a miracle mechanism to take the 3D information</p>
<p>and translate it to the language of inheritance.</p>
<p>You would then in the next generation</p>
<p>have to translate it again to the brain,</p>
<p>although it is different.</p>
<p>This sounds very unlikely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m playing a trick on you now, okay?</p>
<p>Because-</p>
<p>I believe it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m easy to trick, so that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>But if this is how it happens, or if this was required,</p>
<p>it could never happen in my opinion,</p>
<p>which means, and I still think,</p>
<p>that there are certain memories</p>
<p>that cannot transfer transgeneration and is complex.</p>
<p>And things that you learn about the environment</p>
<p>that are arbitrary.</p>
<p>If I, none of our listeners&rsquo; kids</p>
<p>will remember this conversation.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>This is impossible.</p>
<p>Unless they&rsquo;re listening with them.</p>
<p>There are some families or parents</p>
<p>that tell me they listen.</p>
<p>Right, right, but it cannot transmit</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s random and it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>these are connections that are arbitrary.</p>
<p>So this seems to be a limitation of what can transfer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, so perhaps more general things</p>
<p>could pass, some, these type of things,</p>
<p>I doubt they could pass.</p>
<p>However, you can nevertheless imagine</p>
<p>that some things that are very specific,</p>
<p>some memories that are very, very specific,</p>
<p>could nevertheless transmit from the brain</p>
<p>after learning to the next generation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you an example.</p>
<p>You can teach worms, even though they have</p>
<p>just 302 neurons, you can teach them</p>
<p>simple things about the world.</p>
<p>For example, you can take an odor that the worms like.</p>
<p>The worms have thousands of odorant receptors</p>
<p>and they can recognize many, many, many molecules.</p>
<p>They can smell them so they can find food</p>
<p>or avoid enemies.</p>
<p>You can take a food that the worms,</p>
<p>an odor that the worms like and pair it</p>
<p>to something bad like starvation.</p>
<p>And then the worms will learn to dislike this odor.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know that this learning involves necessarily</p>
<p>changing in the strength of synapses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a possibility, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be the case.</p>
<p>It could be that just the receptor</p>
<p>for this particular odor is being removed</p>
<p>when they, and this is how they learn.</p>
<p>Now they won&rsquo;t have the receptor,</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t smell, they won&rsquo;t like the odor.</p>
<p>This is a possibility.</p>
<p>This type of thing, you can perhaps,</p>
<p>not that anyone has showed it convincingly,</p>
<p>transmit to the next generation because</p>
<p>all it would take is an RNA that will</p>
<p>control this particular receptor, okay?</p>
<p>So this is a possibility.</p>
<p>People have shown things like that, not in C. elegans,</p>
<p>but people have shown things like this in mammals.</p>
<p>They said that you learn a certain thing</p>
<p>and then just in the next generation,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a particular receptor would be</p>
<p>methylated or would change,</p>
<p>and this would transmit the response.</p>
<p>And on the one hand, it could be true.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you need to understand,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll need to prove, and this wasn&rsquo;t done</p>
<p>convincingly enough yet,</p>
<p>how exactly does the information transfer</p>
<p>from the brain to the germ cells,</p>
<p>and then in the next generation,</p>
<p>from the germ cells back to the brain</p>
<p>to where the receptor need to operate.</p>
<p>And this is a challenge.</p>
<p>This is the current state of the field</p>
<p>that this is something that needs to be proven.</p>
<p>What we did in C. elegans is we showed</p>
<p>that certain, that the brain can communicate</p>
<p>with the next generations using small RNAs,</p>
<p>and that this can change behavior.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t require any translating</p>
<p>between any language.</p>
<p>It is very simple.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;ve shown is that if you take a worm</p>
<p>and you change the production of small RNAs</p>
<p>just in its brain, in the next generations,</p>
<p>their behavior will be different,</p>
<p>even though you don&rsquo;t mess with their brains.</p>
<p>This is a paper that we published in 2019 in Cell.</p>
<p>We showed that you just manipulate</p>
<p>the production of endogenous natural RNAs</p>
<p>in the worm&rsquo;s brain that are always made,</p>
<p>but you change their amount,</p>
<p>and this changes the capacity of the worms</p>
<p>in the next generation to find food.</p>
<p>To find, not only in one generation,</p>
<p>but three generations down the road.</p>
<p>And the way that it works is that</p>
<p>perturbing the production of these small RNAs</p>
<p>in the brain affects, in the end,</p>
<p>the expression of a gene in the germline.</p>
<p>One gene is called SAGE2.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know how it works,</p>
<p>but we can do all kinds of controls</p>
<p>where we manipulate the activity of the gene</p>
<p>and see that this also affects behavior.</p>
<p>And this gene works in the germ cells.</p>
<p>The information needs to go from the brain</p>
<p>to the germ cells.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t need to go back from the germ cells</p>
<p>to the brain to affect behavior.</p>
<p>And this depends, we know that this is</p>
<p>a true epigenetic effect because</p>
<p>it goes on for multiple generations,</p>
<p>and also because it requires the machinery</p>
<p>that transfers RNAs between generations.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have the protein that physically carries</p>
<p>the RNA between generations, it doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>So it has to be RNA.</p>
<p>It has to be RNA.</p>
<p>We can also find the RNAs in the next generation</p>
<p>that change.</p>
<p>We sequence the actual RNAs that change</p>
<p>in the next generation.</p>
<p>You mentioned that you don&rsquo;t know what this gene SAGE does,</p>
<p>but is it reasonable to assume that it does something</p>
<p>in the context of the nervous system,</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s unclear as well?</p>
<p>It is possible.</p>
<p>It is possible, but we have reasons to believe,</p>
<p>or experiments to show,</p>
<p>although there could be alternative explanations,</p>
<p>that it functions through the germline.</p>
<p>Now, you may ask, how can you affect behavior</p>
<p>just by changing the germ cells, right?</p>
<p>Well, it would have to change the germ cells</p>
<p>in very specific ways, because as people probably recall,</p>
<p>the germline, the germ cells are where</p>
<p>the inheritable information is contained.</p>
<p>But you can imagine it, for instance,</p>
<p>adjusting the gain or sensitivity, rather,</p>
<p>on some sort of sensory foraging system, right?</p>
<p>Right, and the interesting thing is,</p>
<p>it again can be quite unspecific.</p>
<p>So it sounds weird that you change germ cells</p>
<p>and it changes behavior, sperm and egg,</p>
<p>but if you think about it, it&rsquo;s trivial.</p>
<p>If you castrate a dog, it behaves differently, right?</p>
<p>Sadly, yeah, I did that to my dog,</p>
<p>and I ended up putting him on testosterone therapy later,</p>
<p>and it brought him back, just as an aside.</p>
<p>Yes, this is because the germ cells affect the soma,</p>
<p>including the brain, in many ways,</p>
<p>by secreting certain chemicals.</p>
<p>And also, because the other cells develop</p>
<p>from the germ cells, so some information</p>
<p>could be transmitted over development,</p>
<p>or the course of development could be altered</p>
<p>because of changes that occur in the germ cells.</p>
<p>And for example, in mammals, one of the explanations</p>
<p>for how heritable information transmits</p>
<p>is that it just affects something very early in development.</p>
<p>I told you that the secret to worms&rsquo; inheritance</p>
<p>is that they have the capacity to amplify</p>
<p>these small RNAs all the time.</p>
<p>This is what keeps it going and prevents the dilution.</p>
<p>In mammals, we don&rsquo;t know of such an amplification mechanism,</p>
<p>so you ask, how can a little bit of RNA</p>
<p>or something without amplifying</p>
<p>affect the entire organism?</p>
<p>And it could be that you just perturb something</p>
<p>in the very beginning, when you just have a few cells,</p>
<p>or even in the placenta that develops in pregnancy,</p>
<p>and this later throws everything off.</p>
<p>And because of that, you have many problems</p>
<p>in metabolism and so on.</p>
<p>And this is called, it&rsquo;s an idea</p>
<p>of the developmental origin of health and disease.</p>
<p>Many of the functions occur early on in development.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve raised a number of incredibly</p>
<p>fascinating aspects to this.</p>
<p>I do have a question about one particular aspect,</p>
<p>and feel free to pass on this for a future episode</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s going to take us too far off track.</p>
<p>But something you said, it really captured my attention,</p>
<p>although I was listening to all of it,</p>
<p>which is that the germ cells,</p>
<p>so in the case of males, it&rsquo;s going to be sperm,</p>
<p>and in the case of females, it&rsquo;s going to be eggs.</p>
<p>Something perhaps not coincidental</p>
<p>about those cells and the environment that they live in</p>
<p>is that, yes, they contain the genetic information</p>
<p>to pass to offspring, right?</p>
<p>Of course, you explained how that works.</p>
<p>But also, those cells live in a region</p>
<p>that is rich with hormones that can be secreted,</p>
<p>and in fact, are secreted,</p>
<p>and through so-called endocrine signaling,</p>
<p>communicate with other cells,</p>
<p>not just at the level of receptors on their surface,</p>
<p>but also can enter the genomes of those cells</p>
<p>and modify those cells.</p>
<p>In other words, it seems to me</p>
<p>that the microenvironment of the germ cells,</p>
<p>the testes and the ovaries, are rich with information,</p>
<p>not just for the passage to next generations,</p>
<p>but also for all the, as you said,</p>
<p>all the somatic cells of the body.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re telling the somatic cells of the body</p>
<p>what to do and what to become,</p>
<p>and the best example I can think about this</p>
<p>would be puberty, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I would argue that one of the greatest rates</p>
<p>of aging and transitions we go through in life</p>
<p>is from puberty.</p>
<p>I mean, a child becomes a very different person</p>
<p>after puberty.</p>
<p>They look at the world differently.</p>
<p>They think about it differently.</p>
<p>The growth of, it&rsquo;s not just about the growth</p>
<p>of the hair and the jaw and the atoms,</p>
<p>apple and breasts and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a transformation of the somatic cells</p>
<p>from the same microenvironment</p>
<p>that the DNA-containing cells reside.</p>
<p>Right, so once you think about it like this,</p>
<p>it becomes obvious that just by affecting the germ cells,</p>
<p>you can affect the rest of the body.</p>
<p>And in C. elegans, there are experiments</p>
<p>that show it very clearly.</p>
<p>So for example, if you just take worms</p>
<p>and prevent sperm production,</p>
<p>it changes their capacity to smell.</p>
<p>These are experiments done by others,</p>
<p>which is obviously a brain function.</p>
<p>And in a castrated dog, you&rsquo;re not just eliminating</p>
<p>the possibility of transfer of DNA information</p>
<p>to subsequent generations.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also limiting communication of, yeah.</p>
<p>Without question, my bulldog Costello</p>
<p>changed after castration, and it was a wonderful dog,</p>
<p>but at some point developed some health issues.</p>
<p>The introduction of a small amount of testosterone</p>
<p>every other day changed him fundamentally,</p>
<p>in that case for the better,</p>
<p>back to a version of himself that I had only observed earlier</p>
<p>but also a different version of the same dog.</p>
<p>And no, he wasn&rsquo;t humping everything,</p>
<p>maybe the occasional knee.</p>
<p>Particular people whose names I won&rsquo;t mention.</p>
<p>But it was absolutely clear that the hormone</p>
<p>was not just taking a system and amplifying it,</p>
<p>it was actually modifying the system.</p>
<p>So anyway, I just wanted to highlight that.</p>
<p>And then now, thank you for indulging me.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s, if you will, let&rsquo;s continue down this path</p>
<p>that we were going on, because I want to make sure</p>
<p>that we absolutely get to this issue</p>
<p>of transmission of information</p>
<p>about sex choice of offspring.</p>
<p>So the worms are hermaphrodites,</p>
<p>which means that they make both sperm and eggs.</p>
<p>But there are also males, which are much more rare,</p>
<p>and they can choose to mate with the males or not.</p>
<p>And when they mate with a male, it&rsquo;s a huge decision</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very costly energetically,</p>
<p>and they also risk predation and all kinds of troubles.</p>
<p>The males hurt them and reduce their lifespan</p>
<p>when they mate with them.</p>
<p>People are going to draw all sorts of analogies here,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s inevitable, but hey, here we go.</p>
<p>Yes, and most importantly for evolution,</p>
<p>when you mate with another animal,</p>
<p>you dilute your genome in half.</p>
<p>Because the worms can just self-fertilize</p>
<p>and transmit the exact same genome to the next generation,</p>
<p>but when they mate, they dilute it in half.</p>
<p>So this is a big price to pay.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when you mate, you diversify your genome.</p>
<p>So maybe some combination of gene will be good.</p>
<p>And we know that in humans, I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of interesting that the brain circuits</p>
<p>that are associated with aversion and with approach</p>
<p>are fairly hardwired for a number of things,</p>
<p>like puddle of vomit.</p>
<p>Almost everybody kind of cringes.</p>
<p>Plate of cookies.</p>
<p>If you like cookies, you move towards it.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s one particular word in the English</p>
<p>and particularly the Israeli language</p>
<p>that ought to evoke disgust, and that&rsquo;s incest.</p>
<p>Because incest is actually not just disgusting as a practice</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s dangerous genetically, right?</p>
<p>Because the inbreeding creates a deleterious mutation.</p>
<p>Right, so there are studies on how people in Israeli kibbutz,</p>
<p>for example, where they all grow together,</p>
<p>the children live together, it used to be like that,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t date each other, because this is the classic thing.</p>
<p>I talked to some of them, they told me that&rsquo;s not true,</p>
<p>but yes, there are studies like this that say,</p>
<p>but it makes sense.</p>
<p>And in some countries, Scandinavian countries,</p>
<p>or in Lapland and Iceland where populations are small,</p>
<p>they keep exquisite records of lineage</p>
<p>in order to avoid inbreeding.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>But the worms, it&rsquo;s the safe choice for them</p>
<p>is to self-mate.</p>
<p>And if they mate with a male,</p>
<p>they take a risk but they diversify, okay?</p>
<p>What we found is that if you take the hermaphrodites,</p>
<p>we can call it the female for just one second,</p>
<p>and you stress it with high temperatures,</p>
<p>then the next generations of worms, for three generations,</p>
<p>mate much more with males.</p>
<p>And they do it because the female starts secreting</p>
<p>a pheromone that attracts the males.</p>
<p>Ah, that&rsquo;s a very cryptic mechanism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that she somehow changes and then goes seeking</p>
<p>males, it&rsquo;s that it draws males.</p>
<p>It draws males, and we know how it works.</p>
<p>We think we know how it works.</p>
<p>What happens is that the stress, the high temperatures,</p>
<p>compromise the production of sperm in the hermaphrodites.</p>
<p>So the hermaphrodite don&rsquo;t, they make sperm enough</p>
<p>to make next generations, but the sperm,</p>
<p>because of defective small RNA inheritance,</p>
<p>because RNAs are not inherited, okay?</p>
<p>The sperm is not made optimally, so they make less sperm.</p>
<p>And when they don&rsquo;t make a lot of sperm,</p>
<p>they feel that they don&rsquo;t self-fertilize correctly,</p>
<p>so they call the males by secreting the pheromones</p>
<p>so that it would provide its own sperm</p>
<p>and they can continue to make babies.</p>
<p>And we know this also from experiments.</p>
<p>You just take hermaphrodites and you kill its sperm,</p>
<p>starts secreting a pheromone, and the males come.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a need-based system.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>And I hope people can appreciate as they&rsquo;re hearing this</p>
<p>that none of this we assume,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to speak worm,</p>
<p>none of this we assume is a conscious decision</p>
<p>in these animals.</p>
<p>Much like human mating behavior,</p>
<p>which to us always seems so conscious,</p>
<p>but is being governed by both conscious</p>
<p>and subconscious decision-making.</p>
<p>None of this is an active decision to secrete the hormone</p>
<p>to draw in more males.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply a biasing of probabilities, right?</p>
<p>The hormone is now secreted in greater quantities</p>
<p>or greater frequency.</p>
<p>The males therefore approach more.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just increasing probability of interactions.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>What happens naturally, normally,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t stress the ancestors,</p>
<p>is that the worm starts secreting the pheromone</p>
<p>only when they are old.</p>
<p>This is also, you know, people will&hellip;</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re running out of their own fertility.</p>
<p>Exactly, because they only make the sperm</p>
<p>at a particular time.</p>
<p>And then they run out of stealth sperm.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t self-fertilize,</p>
<p>so they have to call the males.</p>
<p>They want to continue to make.</p>
<p>Well, this is sort of the plastic surgery approach.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll take the heat for that one.</p>
<p>But, you know, but it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I think as certain people age to a certain point</p>
<p>and they feel that their fertility is waning,</p>
<p>if they want offspring,</p>
<p>they need to take any number of different approaches.</p>
<p>They could get a&hellip;</p>
<p>Here we&rsquo;re talking about a female,</p>
<p>but we could also do the reverse, right?</p>
<p>If we get a sperm donor, right?</p>
<p>Or, but if they want to attract a lifelong mate</p>
<p>or co-parent with somebody,</p>
<p>oftentimes they will do things to adjust</p>
<p>their attractiveness in any number of different ways,</p>
<p>psychological attractiveness or physical attractiveness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not afraid to bring this up</p>
<p>because I think that the parallels are very important</p>
<p>because I do think that every species</p>
<p>and individuals within a species, of course,</p>
<p>decides whether or not they want to reproduce or not,</p>
<p>but has an inherent understanding,</p>
<p>conscious or subconscious,</p>
<p>about where they reside in the arc of their lifespan.</p>
<p>I do believe that, not just based on experience.</p>
<p>Some people are very attuned to the passage of time</p>
<p>being very fast, others very slow.</p>
<p>I think that knowing how long your parents</p>
<p>and their parents lived makes a big difference.</p>
<p>I have friends whose fathers in particular</p>
<p>died fairly young,</p>
<p>and all these guys basically got married</p>
<p>and had kids really young.</p>
<p>Right, so here, luckily for me,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to get into psychology of the worms.</p>
<p>The explanation is just like an instinct.</p>
<p>When they run out of sperm,</p>
<p>they start secreting the pheromones and attract the males.</p>
<p>There are studies also in humans about older fathers,</p>
<p>that children of older fathers</p>
<p>have a higher chance of becoming autistic.</p>
<p>There are studies-</p>
<p>40 and up, basically.</p>
<p>However, in this case, it&rsquo;s not clear</p>
<p>that this is something epigenetics could be</p>
<p>just because of DNA damage,</p>
<p>because it accumulates.</p>
<p>Yeah, and actually nowadays,</p>
<p>we have an episode on fertility coming up,</p>
<p>both male and female fertility,</p>
<p>and there are actually DNA fragmentation kits,</p>
<p>at-home DNA fragmentation kits or sperm analysis.</p>
<p>You send the sperm back in,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t do the DNA.</p>
<p>People pipetting semen at home</p>
<p>would be an odd picture.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not go there.</p>
<p>But there are clinics that do this for a nominal charge.</p>
<p>I did want to ask about autism</p>
<p>and human disease in particular.</p>
<p>Another thing that you hear sometimes,</p>
<p>and here I want to acknowledge autism is on a spectrum.</p>
<p>Some people get upset if you call it a disorder.</p>
<p>There are some adaptive autistic traits and et cetera.</p>
<p>But one thing that often comes up</p>
<p>is this idea that two people</p>
<p>who are more of the kind of engineering,</p>
<p>hard science, if you will, of phenotype,</p>
<p>mate and have children,</p>
<p>higher probability of the offspring being on the spectrum.</p>
<p>Some people would argue, ah,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s already selecting for people</p>
<p>that might&rsquo;ve already been partially on the spectrum.</p>
<p>So maybe it&rsquo;s a gene copy issue.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not asking you to comment on autism in particular,</p>
<p>but when you hear things like that,</p>
<p>that the children of older fathers,</p>
<p>born from older fathers,</p>
<p>higher probability of autism,</p>
<p>what does that, at the level of intuition,</p>
<p>does that strike you as an epigenetic phenomenon,</p>
<p>as a nature nurture mishmash,</p>
<p>or the possibility that it&rsquo;s RNA passage or anything?</p>
<p>Does anything sort of trigger the whiskers,</p>
<p>your spidey sense?</p>
<p>So in that case,</p>
<p>I would go with the most parsimonious explanation,</p>
<p>which is just less fidelity of DNA,</p>
<p>less DNA maintenance and some damage that passes on.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be an epigenetic thing.</p>
<p>But the sperm are generated at once every 60 days.</p>
<p>So the damage must be at the level of the germ cells,</p>
<p>not having the proper machinery.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Mitochondria or something like that?</p>
<p>Or the DNA repair machinery.</p>
<p>The DNA repair machinery could be defective,</p>
<p>or could work less well in older people,</p>
<p>leading to the constant production of germ cells</p>
<p>with more mutation.</p>
<p>This is a possibility.</p>
<p>Do we know exactly what the DNA repair machinery is?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There are many types of DNA repair.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one that use other copies of the DNA to correct.</p>
<p>There are ones that just recognize</p>
<p>all kinds of lesions on the DNA and remove it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very elaborate and complicated system.</p>
<p>And is it a system that is now tractable,</p>
<p>that can be modified through pharmacology</p>
<p>or through anything like that?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know about drugs that correct,</p>
<p>that improve it.</p>
<p>Maybe they exist and I&rsquo;m not aware,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very well understood.</p>
<p>And many people are studying these directions.</p>
<p>Yeah, one thing that came across</p>
<p>in the exploration of the fertility work</p>
<p>is that what I&rsquo;m about to describe</p>
<p>is not legal in the US, it is illegal,</p>
<p>but is legal in the UK and in other countries</p>
<p>is this notion of three-parent IVF,</p>
<p>where it does seem that some of the eggs</p>
<p>that persist in older females,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t, even if fertilized, don&rsquo;t produce healthy embryos.</p>
<p>They have chromosomal abnormalities or replications</p>
<p>and deletions that are problematic</p>
<p>for the development of the embryo,</p>
<p>such as trisomy 21, aka Down syndrome,</p>
<p>in part or in large part because of deficits</p>
<p>in the mitochondrial genome.</p>
<p>So what they now do is they take the,</p>
<p>because the mitochondrial genome</p>
<p>resides mainly in the cytoplasm,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll take an egg from the mother,</p>
<p>the sperm from the father,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ll take the nucleus from the mother</p>
<p>and put that into a cytoplasm of a younger woman</p>
<p>whose mitochondrial DNA is healthy,</p>
<p>then use the sperm to fertilize that egg,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called three-parent IVF,</p>
<p>then implant that into the mother.</p>
<p>And this has been done several times</p>
<p>for in cases of mitochondrial damage</p>
<p>or mutations in the mother.</p>
<p>It works, the question is whether or not</p>
<p>those offspring will grow up to be healthy.</p>
<p>So this, of course, is not just a pure divergence.</p>
<p>It raises a bigger question that I have for you,</p>
<p>which is in terms of the work in either C. elegans</p>
<p>or in other model organisms,</p>
<p>but in particular in C. elegans,</p>
<p>where do you see this going next?</p>
<p>And if you would indulge us,</p>
<p>I would love for you to tell us a little bit</p>
<p>about the admittedly unpublished work</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing on temperature exposure and environments.</p>
<p>I mean, how malleable is this system?</p>
<p>Because to me, it just seems incredibly malleable.</p>
<p>And yet a lot of it&rsquo;s still cloaked off to us.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a ton to learn.</p>
<p>So assuming that we will discover similar things in humans,</p>
<p>which we don&rsquo;t know that this is the case,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say we find it.</p>
<p>I think there are many things you can do</p>
<p>before you change it.</p>
<p>For example, you could also change a parent inheritance</p>
<p>by having the parent exercise, for example.</p>
<p>And some things like this have been done.</p>
<p>For example, there are experiments in rodents</p>
<p>where they show that overfeeding the rodents</p>
<p>creates problems for the next generation,</p>
<p>for the children.</p>
<p>However, if you let the rodent exercise,</p>
<p>then it corrects the parent inheritance.</p>
<p>So this is one possibility.</p>
<p>And you can also manipulate it at the source.</p>
<p>You can change, if it&rsquo;s RNAs,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you could in the future,</p>
<p>perhaps if we understand how it works,</p>
<p>actually change the composition of the heritable RNAs.</p>
<p>By eating RNAs just like the worms?</p>
<p>RNA sandwich?</p>
<p>No, so the RNA sandwich will be difficult</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But if you do IVF, if you do vitro fertilization,</p>
<p>you could perhaps change the composition of the RNAs</p>
<p>in the stuff that you introduce.</p>
<p>But way before that, what you could do,</p>
<p>perhaps even in the not so far future,</p>
<p>is use this for diagnostics.</p>
<p>DNA-based diagnostics for every couple</p>
<p>that wants to have a kid.</p>
<p>In Israel, this is done for most couples.</p>
<p>You can look at the DNA and look for genetic disease.</p>
<p>But no one is looking at the RNA at the moment.</p>
<p>If we understand how it works better,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have another level, a whole new world to look at.</p>
<p>And perhaps there will be some RNAs</p>
<p>that correlate with disease that will say,</p>
<p>okay, the beauty is that this, unlike DNA, it&rsquo;s plastic.</p>
<p>So with DNA, this is your DNA,</p>
<p>perhaps we can choose another embryo.</p>
<p>But here you could say, perhaps, or again,</p>
<p>in the future, this is science fiction,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t happen now, but if we understand this</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s true, we can say,</p>
<p>maybe you should run on the treadmill a little bit.</p>
<p>This will change the profile of your RNAs</p>
<p>and then we will use it for IVF.</p>
<p>This seems more, because just it correlates</p>
<p>with healthy profiles of RNAs.</p>
<p>This is a level that no one looks at now</p>
<p>and holds great potential.</p>
<p>Again, with a disclaimer that we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how it works in humans at all.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But of course, this is why it&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s super interesting.</p>
<p>Incredibly promising.</p>
<p>So along the lines of things that one can do</p>
<p>in the short term and your experiments on C. elegans,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love for you to share with us</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re observing about cold exposure</p>
<p>and how that impacts subsequent generations of C. elegans.</p>
<p>And if you would indulge us</p>
<p>with the story of this discovery,</p>
<p>like some of the earlier stories you told us,</p>
<p>it is a surprising and fascinating one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll gladly tell you about it.</p>
<p>This is not a story about transgenerational inheritance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a story about memory within one generation.</p>
<p>Ah, excuse me, okay.</p>
<p>Within one generation, okay?</p>
<p>And as you said, the story of how it happens,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s totally by accident.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a funny story.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m bringing this up because I know Dana Landshaft</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a huge fan of your postdocs</p>
<p>will really, you know, be happy that I mentioned.</p>
<p>This is her work.</p>
<p>And this is unpublished work.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t even finish it.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re working on it.</p>
<p>Okay, well, when it&rsquo;s published,</p>
<p>we will feature the paper because I love this story.</p>
<p>So great.</p>
<p>So what happened is that when you,</p>
<p>we talked about transgenerational memories.</p>
<p>And I said that in worms,</p>
<p>there are very long transgenerational memories.</p>
<p>If a generation time for C. elegans is three days,</p>
<p>some memories last for many generations.</p>
<p>So way beyond the lifespan of the worm.</p>
<p>The lifespan of the worm is three weeks, okay?</p>
<p>You have a new generation every three days,</p>
<p>but every worm lives for three weeks.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of research that shows</p>
<p>that unlike heritable memory, which can be very long,</p>
<p>the memories that the worms acquired</p>
<p>during their lifetime is very short lived.</p>
<p>So if you teach something, after two hours, it forgets.</p>
<p>So for example, you can teach the worm</p>
<p>that you can take an odor that it likes</p>
<p>and pair it with starvation,</p>
<p>and then it would dislike the odor.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a simple test.</p>
<p>You just put it in a plate.</p>
<p>You put the odor in one side</p>
<p>and the control odor on the other side,</p>
<p>and you see whether it prefers this odor or not.</p>
<p>And it stops preferring it, okay?</p>
<p>There is 30 years or more of research,</p>
<p>40 years of research on this,</p>
<p>showing that the worms forget after two hours.</p>
<p>The reason I went to study C. elegans</p>
<p>is that I wanted to understand memory,</p>
<p>because such a simple nervous system,</p>
<p>you say, maybe I have the potential</p>
<p>to actually understand how it works.</p>
<p>But this is slightly disappointing</p>
<p>because they forget after two hours.</p>
<p>So what is it exactly, okay?</p>
<p>My idea was, and I tried to convince students</p>
<p>to do it for 10 years,</p>
<p>is to take the worms, teach them this association</p>
<p>to dislike the odor that they innately like,</p>
<p>and then just put the worms in minus 80</p>
<p>and freeze them, freeze them completely,</p>
<p>thaw them and see whether they still remember</p>
<p>after they are thawed.</p>
<p>The Han Solo experiment.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t want to do it</p>
<p>because of cryopreservation or something like this.</p>
<p>I wanted to do it because, as you know better than me,</p>
<p>many theories about memory say</p>
<p>that you need electrical activity to maintain the memory.</p>
<p>Need to reverberate it in the brain.</p>
<p>During dreams or replay of the thing or whatever.</p>
<p>And if the memories will nevertheless be kept,</p>
<p>even though the worms were frozen in minus 80,</p>
<p>it would mean that it was kept in the absence of electricity</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no electricity in minus 80 degrees.</p>
<p>This was the idea.</p>
<p>I asked many students, no one wanted to do it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not so easy and also a little crazy.</p>
<p>Well, and when the PI, the principal investigator</p>
<p>or lab has a pet experiment,</p>
<p>no one wants to do that experiment.</p>
<p>That is true.</p>
<p>That is the university too.</p>
<p>So, and then I agreed to do it, done a land shift.</p>
<p>I was very happy, only later to find out</p>
<p>that she ignored me completely</p>
<p>and did a different experiment.</p>
<p>The experiment that I did instead</p>
<p>is to just take the worms, teach them the association</p>
<p>and place them on ice.</p>
<p>She wanted to see how the kinetics of memory</p>
<p>and forgetting change in low temperature</p>
<p>because maybe whatever memory is,</p>
<p>the breakdown of the memory is affected by the temperature.</p>
<p>A very simple idea.</p>
<p>We know that-</p>
<p>Different experiment.</p>
<p>A different experiment, but a cool experiment.</p>
<p>Very cool.</p>
<p>And what she found is that when you place the worms on ice,</p>
<p>after you teach them, they just don&rsquo;t forget.</p>
<p>Even 10 times longer than control worms.</p>
<p>At that point, after 24 hours,</p>
<p>if no one wants to forget after two hours,</p>
<p>after 24 hours, the worms will become sick.</p>
<p>So normally we do shorter experiments, okay?</p>
<p>But for two hours, the worms don&rsquo;t forget.</p>
<p>This is cool, but it was only the beginning</p>
<p>because the boring explanation is just what I just said,</p>
<p>that everything slows down in low temperatures.</p>
<p>So the breakdown of memory,</p>
<p>again, we don&rsquo;t know what it is, but whatever it is,</p>
<p>happens slower in low temperatures.</p>
<p>But this is not the case.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not merely the physical, it&rsquo;s the response,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the changing of the internal state of the worms,</p>
<p>which affects the memory kinetics.</p>
<p>How do we know this?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a beautiful work over the last 20 years</p>
<p>on cold tolerance in C. elegans nematodes.</p>
<p>If you take the worms and you place them on ice,</p>
<p>like she did, but longer, for 48 hours, they all die.</p>
<p>However, if you take the worms,</p>
<p>acclimate them to lower temperatures for a few hours,</p>
<p>five hours is the minimum,</p>
<p>and then place them on ice, they all survive.</p>
<p>They become cold tolerant,</p>
<p>and people who study this show that this involves changes</p>
<p>in lipid metabolism and many things.</p>
<p>So Dana took the worms,</p>
<p>acclimated them to slightly lower temperatures,</p>
<p>made them cold resistant,</p>
<p>and then taught them the association</p>
<p>and placed them on ice, and now they forgot immediately,</p>
<p>which means that when they change their internal state</p>
<p>to become cold tolerant,</p>
<p>they no longer extend memories on ice,</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s not only the temperature,</p>
<p>because the temperature was at any way low,</p>
<p>now they don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>We took this as a starting point to understand</p>
<p>which genes change when the worms</p>
<p>are becoming cold tolerant on and off ice.</p>
<p>And we found genes that when you mutate them,</p>
<p>the worms just remember longer always,</p>
<p>even when they&rsquo;re off ice,</p>
<p>because these are the genes that normally change</p>
<p>when they are surprised on the ice.</p>
<p>And these genes are expressed just in one pair of neurons,</p>
<p>just two out of the 302.</p>
<p>Notice he said 302, not 300.</p>
<p>And we can manipulate the activities of these genes</p>
<p>in these neurons to extend memory.</p>
<p>And then the punchline of everything that happened</p>
<p>is that we found out that this neuron,</p>
<p>where these genes function,</p>
<p>this one pair of neurons,</p>
<p>is the only neuron in C. elegans</p>
<p>which is sensitive to lithium.</p>
<p>And lithium is a drug that is being given</p>
<p>to bipolar disorder patients for decades,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s not entirely clear how it works,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very, very interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also interesting, there&rsquo;s an episode,</p>
<p>of course, in your podcast about this,</p>
<p>you know more about this than me a lot,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also interesting because it&rsquo;s just an atom</p>
<p>created in the Big Bang,</p>
<p>yet it works on our brains in such a fundamental way.</p>
<p>And we wanted to see whether it works also on the worms,</p>
<p>because this neuron was tied</p>
<p>to this memory extension phenotype that we found.</p>
<p>So Dana grew the worms on lithium,</p>
<p>removed them from lithium,</p>
<p>taught them the association and found out</p>
<p>that they remember a lot longer than control worms.</p>
<p>Not only that, if you first make the worms cold tolerant,</p>
<p>and then lithium doesn&rsquo;t work on them.</p>
<p>So lithium switches this forgetfulness mechanism on and off.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all connected to cold tolerance.</p>
<p>Amazing, and amazing for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>And so at risk of being long-winded in my response,</p>
<p>I just wanted to highlight something</p>
<p>that I think will be of relevance to most people,</p>
<p>which is when, at some point,</p>
<p>we did a few episodes on memory,</p>
<p>and I highlighted a review that was written</p>
<p>by the great James McGaugh,</p>
<p>one of the great mammalian memory researchers,</p>
<p>who worked a lot on humans and mice.</p>
<p>And I was shocked, pun intended,</p>
<p>and amused to learn that in medieval times,</p>
<p>if people wanted children to remember lessons,</p>
<p>they could be religious lessons or school doctrine</p>
<p>or whatever it was, mathematics,</p>
<p>they would take children, teach them,</p>
<p>and then throw them into cold water</p>
<p>to introduce a memory-instilling event.</p>
<p>And we now know that the memory-instilling event</p>
<p>is the release of adrenaline in the body,</p>
<p>which makes perfect sense</p>
<p>if you think about traumatic events,</p>
<p>but this whole general mechanism</p>
<p>also applies to the learning of other types of information.</p>
<p>And so if I understand correctly</p>
<p>about the role of lithium and the role of cold</p>
<p>in the experiments that you just described,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some general state switch,</p>
<p>some internal state switch,</p>
<p>that says what happened in the minutes or hours</p>
<p>preceding this was important.</p>
<p>It acts as sort of like a highlighter pen</p>
<p>in the book of experiences.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m absolutely curious to know</p>
<p>whether or not this is an RNA-dependent mechanism</p>
<p>in some way.</p>
<p>So is this literally like the highlighter</p>
<p>in the IKEA instruction book?</p>
<p>This, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>This, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And as I said, this is not even a finished work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not peer-reviewed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the state that I told you about,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very exciting for me to go into this new field.</p>
<p>And once it&rsquo;s out, I&rsquo;d be happy to talk more about it</p>
<p>and think about the implications</p>
<p>and the connections to other things</p>
<p>and more about the mechanism.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, thank you for sharing with us,</p>
<p>despite the fact that it&rsquo;s not finished.</p>
<p>People now know that it&rsquo;s also not finished,</p>
<p>and I love a good cliffhanger.</p>
<p>We await the full conclusion</p>
<p>and interpretation of these results.</p>
<p>Today, you&rsquo;ve taken us on an amazing journey</p>
<p>through the genome, RNA, short-interfering RNAs,</p>
<p>a ton of history of prior experiments,</p>
<p>some of which ended tragically,</p>
<p>many of which, unfortunately, did not,</p>
<p>and they were true triumphs,</p>
<p>and in particular, the work in your laboratory,</p>
<p>which is just incredible,</p>
<p>and also this introduction of model organisms.</p>
<p>And I only mentioned a short handful of the things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve taught us about today.</p>
<p>So first, I want to extend thanks</p>
<p>for the incredible teaching.</p>
<p>I also want to say thank you</p>
<p>for something equally important,</p>
<p>which is that absolutely came through,</p>
<p>but is what initially brought me</p>
<p>to explore you and your work more,</p>
<p>although I had certainly heard of you,</p>
<p>which is that your spirit and kind of approach to biology</p>
<p>is an extremely unique and intoxicating one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even, I venture to call it seductive.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>I do believe that whether or not it&rsquo;s music or poetry</p>
<p>or science or mathematics,</p>
<p>that the spirit behind something</p>
<p>dictates the amount of intelligence and precision</p>
<p>with which that thing is carried out,</p>
<p>and it absolutely comes through.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m making you feel on the spot about this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve succeeded.</p>
<p>Thank you, thank you very much.</p>
<p>But I know that the listeners can feel it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a felt thing.</p>
<p>So thank you.</p>
<p>There are many scientists out there,</p>
<p>fewer with this phenotype,</p>
<p>and even fewer that, you know,</p>
<p>I think that can communicate with such articulate precision.</p>
<p>So thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a real pleasure.</p>
<p>Pleasure was all mine.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>Great, well, we&rsquo;ll do it again,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll learn about all the incredible things you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>trying to transform science, as it were,</p>
<p>at the level of publishing, at the level of social media,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a whole other discussion there.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we will, of course,</p>
<p>point people in the direction of you</p>
<p>and to learn more about your work.</p>
<p>And I look forward to hearing</p>
<p>the conclusion of Dana&rsquo;s studies.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a real pleasure.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me today</p>
<p>for my discussion with Dr. Oded Rakhavi</p>
<p>about genetics, inheritance, the epigenome,</p>
<p>and transgenerational passage of traits.</p>

<p>Not so much on today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>we discuss supplements.</p>
<p>While supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>for things like improving sleep,</p>
<p>improving focus, and for hormone support.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab podcast is proud to partner</p>
<p>with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done that for several reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, Momentus Supplements</p>
<p>are the very highest quality.</p>
<p>Also, they tend to focus on single-ingredient formulations,</p>
<p>which makes it very straightforward</p>
<p>to build the most cost-effective</p>
<p>and biologically effective supplement regimen for you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also partnered with Momentus</p>
<p>because we realized that many listeners of this podcast</p>
<p>reside outside of the United States,</p>
<p>and fortunately, Momentus ships internationally.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about the supplements</p>
<p>discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>

<p>We are Huberman Lab on Instagram, Twitter,</p>
<p>Facebook, and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>And at all those places, I cover information,</p>
<p>some of which overlaps with the content</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>but much of which is distinct from content</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s Huberman Lab on all social media channels.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>also has a so-called neural network newsletter.</p>
<p>This is a zero-cost monthly newsletter</p>
<p>that consists of podcast summaries and so-called toolkits,</p>
<p>and those toolkits range from things like a toolkit</p>
<p>for sleep, for focus, for controlling dopamine,</p>
<p>deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>for increasing focus, and much, much more.</p>
<p>If you want to sign up for that newsletter,</p>
<p>you can go to HubermanLab.com,</p>
<p>go to the menu, scroll down to newsletter.</p>
<p>You simply provide your email,</p>
<p>and I assure you, we do not share your email with anybody.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s a completely zero-cost newsletter.</p>
