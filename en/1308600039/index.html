    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, I have the pleasure of introducing</p>
<p>Dr. Matthew Johnson.</p>
<p>Dr. Johnson is a professor of psychiatry</p>
<p>at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine,</p>
<p>where he also directs the Center for Psychedelic</p>
<p>and Consciousness Research.</p>
<p>As many of you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s extreme excitement about the use of psychedelics</p>
<p>for the treatment of various disorders of the mind.</p>
<p>Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s laboratory</p>
<p>is among the premier laboratories in the world</p>
<p>understanding how these compounds work,</p>
<p>how things like psilocybin and LSD and related compounds</p>
<p>allow neural circuitry in the brain to be shaped and change</p>
<p>such that people can combat diseases like depression</p>
<p>or trauma or other disorders of the mind</p>
<p>that cause tremendous suffering.</p>
<p>Dr. Johnson is also an expert in understanding</p>
<p>how different types of drugs impact</p>
<p>different types of human behaviors,</p>
<p>such as sexual behavior, risk-taking, and crime.</p>
<p>Dr. Johnson and his work have also been featured prominently</p>
<p>in the popular press,</p>
<p>such as articles in the New York Times,</p>
<p>in Michael Pollan&rsquo;s book, How to Change Your Mind,</p>
<p>and in a feature in 60 Minutes about psychedelics</p>
<p>and the new emerging science of psychedelic therapies</p>
<p>for treating mental disorders.</p>
<p>During the course of today&rsquo;s conversation,</p>
<p>Dr. Johnson and I talk about psychedelics</p>
<p>at the level of what&rsquo;s called microdosing,</p>
<p>whether or not it is useful for the treatment</p>
<p>of any mental disorders.</p>
<p>We also talk about more typical macrodosing,</p>
<p>what those macrodoses entail.</p>
<p>And he walks us through what an experiment</p>
<p>of a patient taking psychedelics</p>
<p>for the treatment of depression looks like</p>
<p>in his laboratory from start to finish.</p>
<p>The conversation was an absolutely fascinating one</p>
<p>for me to partake in.</p>
<p>I learned so much about the past, present, and future</p>
<p>of psychedelic treatments and compounds.</p>
<p>And indeed, I hope to have Dr. Johnson</p>
<p>on this podcast again in the not too distant future</p>
<p>so that we can talk about other compounds</p>
<p>that powerfully impact the mind and human behavior,</p>
<p>and perhaps can also be used to treat various diseases.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects of our brain</p>
<p>and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things</p>
<p>and remove things from your protocol</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now my conversation with Dr. Matthew Johnson.</p>
<p>Well, Matthew, I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to this</p>
<p>for a long time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of your scientific work,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m eager to learn from you.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Likewise, big fan and happy to do this with you.</p>
<p>Okay, well, thank you.</p>
<p>My first question is a very basic one,</p>
<p>which is what is a psychedelic?</p>
<p>We hear this term all the time,</p>
<p>but what qualifies a substance as a psychedelic?</p>
<p>Nomenclature is a real challenge in this area of psychedelics.</p>
<p>So starting with the word psychedelic,</p>
<p>it just, if you&rsquo;re a pharmacologist,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not very satisfying</p>
<p>because that term really spans</p>
<p>different pharmacological classes.</p>
<p>In other words, if you&rsquo;re really concerned</p>
<p>about receptor effects and the basic effects of a compound,</p>
<p>it spans several classes of compounds.</p>
<p>But overall, so it&rsquo;s really more of a cultural term,</p>
<p>or it does have a relationship to drug effects,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s at a very high level.</p>
<p>So all of the so-called psychedelics</p>
<p>across these distinct classes</p>
<p>that I can talk more about,</p>
<p>the way I put it is they all have the ability</p>
<p>to profoundly alter one&rsquo;s sense of reality,</p>
<p>and that can mean many things.</p>
<p>Part of that is profoundly altering the sense of self,</p>
<p>acutely, so when someone&rsquo;s on the psychedelic.</p>
<p>So the different classes that can be,</p>
<p>the specific pharmacological classes</p>
<p>that can be called a psychedelic</p>
<p>are what are called the classic psychedelics.</p>
<p>So in the literature, you&rsquo;ll see that term,</p>
<p>and hallucinogen and psychedelic</p>
<p>all have traditionally been used synonymously.</p>
<p>I think there was a little of a tendency</p>
<p>to stay away from psychedelics as the baggage,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s been a return to that in the last several years.</p>
<p>But the classic psychedelics or classic hallucinogens</p>
<p>are things like LSD, psilocybin,</p>
<p>which is in so-called magic mushrooms.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in over 200 species that we know of so far of mushrooms.</p>
<p>Dimethyltryptamine or DMT,</p>
<p>which is in dozens and dozens of plants.</p>
<p>Mescaline, which is in the peyote cacti</p>
<p>and some other cacti like San Pedro.</p>
<p>And even amongst these classic psychedelics,</p>
<p>there are two structural classes.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the chemistry.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the tryptamine-based compounds</p>
<p>like psilocybin and DMT,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the phenethylamine-based compounds.</p>
<p>So these are the basic two,</p>
<p>basically building blocks that you&rsquo;re starting from,</p>
<p>either a tryptamine structure or a phenethylamine structure.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just the chemistry.</p>
<p>All of the, what&rsquo;s more important,</p>
<p>or at least to someone like me,</p>
<p>are the receptor effects.</p>
<p>And then ultimately that&rsquo;s going to have a relationship</p>
<p>to the behavioral and subjective effects.</p>
<p>So all of these classic psychedelics serve as agonists</p>
<p>or partial agonists at the serotonin two-way receptor,</p>
<p>so subtype of serotonin receptor.</p>
<p>Then you have these other classes of compounds</p>
<p>that you could call psychedelic.</p>
<p>Another big one would be the NMDA antagonist.</p>
<p>So this would include ketamine, PCP,</p>
<p>and dextromethorphan,</p>
<p>something I&rsquo;ve done some research with,</p>
<p>which folks might recognize from like robo-tripping,</p>
<p>guzzling like, you know, cough syrup,</p>
<p>which is something kind of like high school kids</p>
<p>are known to do and they can&rsquo;t get ahold of real drugs,</p>
<p>that type of thing.</p>
<p>So a large overlap in the types of subjective effects</p>
<p>that you get from those compounds</p>
<p>compared to the two-way agonist classic psychedelics.</p>
<p>But then you have, and by the way,</p>
<p>this description, this framework I&rsquo;m describing,</p>
<p>not everyone will agree.</p>
<p>Some people will say,</p>
<p>no, psychedelic only means classic psychedelic.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s different opinions here.</p>
<p>But you have, gosh, salvinorin A,</p>
<p>which is a kappa opioid agonist, which again-</p>
<p>Where does that come from?</p>
<p>Salvia divinorum, it&rsquo;s a plant.</p>
<p>It became 20 years ago.</p>
<p>It sort of popped onto the legal high scene.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a long history of this,</p>
<p>predating the internet,</p>
<p>going back to like the stuff</p>
<p>Oinkledore in the back of High Times Magazine.</p>
<p>And most of this stuff like never worked, you know?</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s like, smoke enough of anything,</p>
<p>maybe you get a little bit lightheaded.</p>
<p>But this is one of those things that popped around</p>
<p>20 years ago when it quickly got the reputation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, holy shit, this stuff actually works</p>
<p>and works really strongly.</p>
<p>In these smoked extracts particularly,</p>
<p>people have these reality altering experiences</p>
<p>on par with smoked DMT, the classic psychedelic.</p>
<p>So often, and we did the first blinded,</p>
<p>controlled human research with salvinorin A.</p>
<p>So lots of entity contact.</p>
<p>So feeling that you, in the experience of one</p>
<p>is actually interacting with autonomous beings,</p>
<p>that type of thing.</p>
<p>And then you have another big one,</p>
<p>I probably should have mentioned even before the,</p>
<p>you know, salvinorin A, but you have MDMA,</p>
<p>which really stands in a class by itself.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been called an intactogen and-</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>It means like touching within.</p>
<p>It sort of alludes to the idea</p>
<p>that it can really put someone in touch with their emotions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also been called an empathogen,</p>
<p>meaning it can afford empathy.</p>
<p>But I think intactogen is probably,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the term that I tend to focus on.</p>
<p>And I know I&rsquo;m not telling you anything you don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but for the viewers,</p>
<p>the primary mechanism of MDMA is serotonin release</p>
<p>and to a degree, other monoamine release,</p>
<p>dopamine serotonin.</p>
<p>And so structurally, that&rsquo;s also in the phenethylamine class</p>
<p>which contains mescaline, the classic psychedelic,</p>
<p>but also amphetamine.</p>
<p>So just like Adderall is in that phenethylamine class.</p>
<p>And so this is another example</p>
<p>where chemistry doesn&rsquo;t dictate.</p>
<p>I mean, you can tweak a molecule,</p>
<p>it might have that same basic structure,</p>
<p>but now you&rsquo;ve profoundly changed the way it interacts</p>
<p>with the receptor.</p>
<p>So MDMA does not, you know,</p>
<p>exert its actions by, I like to say,</p>
<p>by mimicking the baseball,</p>
<p>entering the post-synaptic receptor side,</p>
<p>you know, acting as an agonist.</p>
<p>So mimicking the endogenous neurotransmitter serotonin</p>
<p>like the classic psychedelics do,</p>
<p>MDMA works on the pitcher side</p>
<p>of just basically throwing out more of the natural,</p>
<p>the endogenous-</p>
<p>Dumping more serotonin.</p>
<p>Dumping more serotonin, flooding the synapse.</p>
<p>So I get the impression that the psychedelic space</p>
<p>is a enormous cloud of partially overlapping compounds.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Meaning some are impacting the serotonin system</p>
<p>more than the dopamine system.</p>
<p>Others are impacting the dopamine system</p>
<p>more than the serotonin system.</p>
<p>Given that the definition of a psychedelic</p>
<p>is that it profoundly alters sense of self,</p>
<p>at least that&rsquo;s included as a partial definition.</p>
<p>Can we break that down into a couple of subcategories?</p>
<p>So for instance, hallucinating,</p>
<p>either auditory or visual,</p>
<p>synesthesia, perceptual blending,</p>
<p>the sense that, you know, you can hear colors</p>
<p>and see sounds, for instance,</p>
<p>a common report of people that take psychedelics</p>
<p>in sufficiently high doses.</p>
<p>So hallucinating, synesthesia,</p>
<p>and then in terms of sense of self,</p>
<p>you know, as a neuroscientist, I think,</p>
<p>okay, what does it mean to alter a sense of reality?</p>
<p>Really what the brain does in a very coarse way</p>
<p>is to try and figure out what&rsquo;s happening in space,</p>
<p>physical space, and that physical space</p>
<p>could be within us or outside us,</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s happening in time.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And as a vision scientist,</p>
<p>the simplest explanation is when I move my hand</p>
<p>from one location to another location,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s measuring the space,</p>
<p>the location of my hand in space over time,</p>
<p>and then you get a rate and a speed</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That gets more complicated</p>
<p>as you get into the emotional realm.</p>
<p>But is it fair to say that psychedelics</p>
<p>are impacting the space-time analysis</p>
<p>that the brain is performing</p>
<p>and thereby creating hallucinations</p>
<p>and thereby altering, you know,</p>
<p>the blending of senses?</p>
<p>Is it fair to say that?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to explore that area,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m thinking.</p>
<p>Clearly, there is a changed relationship,</p>
<p>certainly at the right dose,</p>
<p>of orientation in space-time.</p>
<p>I think as a, you know, I&rsquo;m primarily a behaviorist,</p>
<p>and in terms of human behavioral pharmacology,</p>
<p>I always go to comparative pharmacology.</p>
<p>Okay, what can we say that is truly unique</p>
<p>about the classic psychedelics,</p>
<p>or psychedelics in general?</p>
<p>So with that description, I&rsquo;m thinking,</p>
<p>okay, alcohol can really screw up</p>
<p>your time-space orientation.</p>
<p>And proprioception, your balance, vestibular, yeah.</p>
<p>And in many ways, and in those gross motor ways,</p>
<p>like far worse, you know,</p>
<p>of course everything&rsquo;s dose-dependent,</p>
<p>but in the classic psychedelics,</p>
<p>obviously the benzodiazepines</p>
<p>being very similar to alcohol, same thing.</p>
<p>So, you know, I&rsquo;d want to, you know,</p>
<p>dig in a little more in terms of like,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s something more specific we could say</p>
<p>about that relationship to time and space</p>
<p>that the psychedelics are tinkering with.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not sure, it&rsquo;s an interesting hypothesis,</p>
<p>the idea that that&rsquo;s a mediator,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something fundamental about changing that,</p>
<p>the representation in time and space.</p>
<p>There might be something to that.</p>
<p>I think of these as psychedelics</p>
<p>as profoundly altering models.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re all, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re prediction machines and that&rsquo;s large,</p>
<p>so much of that is top-down</p>
<p>and psychedelics have a good way of,</p>
<p>you know, loosely speaking, dissolving those models.</p>
<p>And one of, at the reality-</p>
<p>Can you give us an example of one of like a model,</p>
<p>like I know that when I throw a ball in the air,</p>
<p>it falls down, not up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a prediction that I learned as a child.</p>
<p>I did not come into the world with a brain</p>
<p>that knew that relationship between objects and gravity,</p>
<p>but one of the first things that a child learns</p>
<p>is the relationship between objects and gravity</p>
<p>and their trajectories.</p>
<p>Yeah, and with a four-year-old,</p>
<p>I mean, I saw that at earlier ages,</p>
<p>like that experimentation of like,</p>
<p>oh yeah, that&rsquo;s what happens, you know?</p>
<p>So if he were to throw a ball,</p>
<p>if your child were to throw a ball</p>
<p>and it went up into the sky,</p>
<p>that would be absolutely mind-blowing.</p>
<p>It would be for an adult, too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be a pretty psychedelic experience, probably.</p>
<p>Right, and so there&rsquo;s a rule there, you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a kind of a prediction,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a rule that underlies a prediction</p>
<p>that when that rule is violated,</p>
<p>all of a sudden the circuit,</p>
<p>presumably, for that prediction,</p>
<p>like it doesn&rsquo;t have a mind of its own,</p>
<p>but somehow it creates a surprise element</p>
<p>or a recognition element.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not filtered out, you know?</p>
<p>And this might sound extreme,</p>
<p>but there are these cases,</p>
<p>it was overblown in sort of the propaganda</p>
<p>of the late 60s, early 70s,</p>
<p>but there are credible cases of people,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s very atypical,</p>
<p>of sounds like they really thought they could fly</p>
<p>and, you know, jump out of a window.</p>
<p>Now, far more people every year fall,</p>
<p>I mean, who knows, you know?</p>
<p>They fall and die out of, you know,</p>
<p>from height because they&rsquo;re drunk, you know?</p>
<p>So this is extremely rare.</p>
<p>But, you know, there are some pretty convincing cases.</p>
<p>There was one research volunteer in our studies</p>
<p>that she looked like she was,</p>
<p>in one of our studies,</p>
<p>like she was trying to dive through a painting on the wall.</p>
<p>She was fine, but she,</p>
<p>reviewing the video,</p>
<p>it looked like she really thought</p>
<p>that she was going to go through that painting</p>
<p>and, who knows, you know?</p>
<p>So she was-</p>
<p>Into the other dimension.</p>
<p>Yeah, so they&rsquo;re violating these predictions.</p>
<p>Yeah, the reason I ask it,</p>
<p>the question the way I did,</p>
<p>is because given the enormous cloud of different substances</p>
<p>and given the range of previous experiences</p>
<p>that people show up to a psychedelic experience with,</p>
<p>I feel like the ability to extract</p>
<p>some universal themes is useful,</p>
<p>especially for people who haven&rsquo;t done them before, right?</p>
<p>Who might not have an understanding</p>
<p>of what their effects are like.</p>
<p>Can we just briefly touch on the serotonin system</p>
<p>and the dopamine system?</p>
<p>I want to acknowledge that, as you already know,</p>
<p>that there are many neuromodulator systems in the body</p>
<p>and, you know, the opioid systems, cannabinoid systems,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something so profound</p>
<p>about the serotonin system and the dopamine system</p>
<p>because the way I define a neuromodulator is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a modulator,</p>
<p>it changes the way that other circuits behave.</p>
<p>And essentially, it increases the probability</p>
<p>that certain circuits will be active</p>
<p>and decreases the probability</p>
<p>that other circuits will be active, in a general sense.</p>
<p>So compounds like LSD, lysergic acid, diethylamide,</p>
<p>and psilocybin,</p>
<p>my understanding is that they primarily</p>
<p>target the serotonin system.</p>
<p>How do they do that at a kind of general level?</p>
<p>And why would increasing the activity</p>
<p>of a particular serotonin receptor</p>
<p>or batch of serotonin receptors</p>
<p>lead to these profoundly different experiences</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re calling model challenges,</p>
<p>challenging preexisting models and predictions?</p>
<p>I mean, at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s a chemical</p>
<p>and these receptors are scattered around the brain</p>
<p>with billions of other receptors.</p>
<p>What do we think is going on in a general sense?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And this is really the area of active exploration</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t have great answers.</p>
<p>We know a good amount</p>
<p>about the receptor-level pharmacology,</p>
<p>some things about post-receptor signaling pathways.</p>
<p>In other words, just fitting into the receptor,</p>
<p>clearly serotonin itself is not psychedelic,</p>
<p>or else we&rsquo;d be tripping all of us all the time.</p>
<p>Because when I eat a bagel, I get serotonin release, right?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s turkey, I mean, there&rsquo;s triptophan, right?</p>
<p>My understanding of serotonin is that in very broad strokes,</p>
<p>that it generally leads to a state of being fairly,</p>
<p>it pushes the mind and body towards a state of contentment</p>
<p>within the immediate experience,</p>
<p>whereas the dopamine system really places us</p>
<p>into an external view of what&rsquo;s out there in the world</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Need to do something.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s consistent with my understanding.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll certainly not, in terms of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t primarily identify as a neuroscientist.</p>
<p>Definitely tell the viewers</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re far more in your domain here than mine,</p>
<p>but in terms of how psychedelics and other drugs</p>
<p>interface at the neuroscience level.</p>
<p>Well, feel free to explain it at the experiential level.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>I think there probably are some audience members</p>
<p>that are interested in, is it the 5H2C?</p>
<p>Is it the layer five neurons in cortex?</p>
<p>That conversation we could hold,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s an interesting conversation,</p>
<p>but just in terms of the experience of serotonergic</p>
<p>versus dopaminergic drugs.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They do seem to create distinct classes of experience.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s the appropriate level</p>
<p>for us to discuss them.</p>
<p>And in terms of how they,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d like to explore the biology a little bit here</p>
<p>and tell you sort of what&rsquo;s known</p>
<p>and what some of the ideas are.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>You have this path, as you know,</p>
<p>like these are levels of analysis</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not which one is going on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like for the particular question,</p>
<p>which level of analysis is most appropriate?</p>
<p>Is it, you know, is a question best addressed by the biology,</p>
<p>the chemistry or the physics?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I think of like receptor level,</p>
<p>post-receptor signaling,</p>
<p>downstream effects on other neurotransmitters,</p>
<p>and then activation level effects,</p>
<p>and then coordination of activation.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got the, clearly with the classic psychedelics,</p>
<p>the 2A activation,</p>
<p>we do know that there are downstream effects</p>
<p>in terms of increasing glutamate transmission.</p>
<p>So this is likely a commonality why, you know,</p>
<p>ketamine is very psychedelic in a slightly different way,</p>
<p>but-</p>
<p>Do people hallucinate on ketamine?</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s more dissociative.</p>
<p>So someone is more likely to sort of</p>
<p>be less behaviorally active.</p>
<p>If they have a really high dose, they go into a K-hole.</p>
<p>And if they go in a really high dose,</p>
<p>like you get in surgery-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s called, a K-hole?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just unconscious.</p>
<p>Yeah, a K-hole.</p>
<p>Not an A-hole, but a K-hole.</p>
<p>A K-hole, yeah, it&rsquo;s very different.</p>
<p>The K-hole, ketamine&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>because people can take kind of bumps</p>
<p>and kind of dance on it</p>
<p>with the sort of an alcohol level strength of effect.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sort of the classic kind of raving,</p>
<p>you know, use of it.</p>
<p>But then those folks want to titrate their dose</p>
<p>because if they do more of like a line,</p>
<p>you get up to like 7,500 milligrams.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;re talking about, you know,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re on the dance floor, you&rsquo;re on the floor</p>
<p>and your friends are trying to make sure</p>
<p>people aren&rsquo;t stepping on you.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like-</p>
<p>Yeah, why would somebody want to take</p>
<p>a dissociative anesthetic?</p>
<p>Like to me, it&rsquo;s completely mysterious</p>
<p>as to why someone would want to dissociate from their body.</p>
<p>People claim that these NMDA antagonist psychedelics</p>
<p>are extremely insightful, you know,</p>
<p>in a very similar way to the experiences</p>
<p>with the classic psychedelics.</p>
<p>And ketamine is now legal for therapeutic use, correct?</p>
<p>Right, right, Spravato, the intranasal form</p>
<p>marketed by Janssen, which is S-ketamine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s prescription.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s prescription and-</p>
<p>So people are taking in the nasal spray.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then are they undergoing talk therapy</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re doing this?</p>
<p>Typically not.</p>
<p>So this is very interesting</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s so much work that needs to be done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not treated as psychedelic therapy.</p>
<p>And by that, psychedelic therapy, I mean,</p>
<p>you tell the person they&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>an altered experience.</p>
<p>You tell them to pay attention to that experience,</p>
<p>that they might learn something from that experience.</p>
<p>And afterwards, you discuss that experience.</p>
<p>With Spravato, the model is-</p>
<p>Spravato is?</p>
<p>Is S-ketamine.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, yeah, the spray form of ketamine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been FDA approved</p>
<p>for treatment-resistant depression.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ll probably feel different.</p>
<p>Ignore that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a side effect.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an adverse effect.</p>
<p>Just ignore it.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t think that has anything to do</p>
<p>with the way it works.</p>
<p>But just get this thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a direct sort of chemotherapeutic effect in a sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not facilitating a learning process.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s older work.</p>
<p>There was a guy, Krupitsky, in Russia</p>
<p>that did extensive work with higher doses of ketamine.</p>
<p>I should say Spravato at the prescribed doses</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t very, it&rsquo;s a pretty low dose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the mild psychedelic range,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not very strong.</p>
<p>But this older work that happened</p>
<p>in the 90s and early 2000s in Russia,</p>
<p>they were using very high doses</p>
<p>and treating it like a psychedelic,</p>
<p>treating it as if it was a psychedelic therapy.</p>
<p>In other words, telling people,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have this experience.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re hoping you learn something from it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to help you through it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to discuss it afterwards.</p>
<p>And they found incredibly high rates of success</p>
<p>in some pretty well-controlled trials</p>
<p>for both heroin addiction and alcohol addiction.</p>
<p>So I think a whole lot of work needs to be done now.</p>
<p>And you see some of the ketamine clinics</p>
<p>that are using ketamine off-label,</p>
<p>a lot of them are treating it like psychedelic therapy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s essentially no research at this point on that.</p>
<p>Do you get better results?</p>
<p>Straight abusive spravato, there&rsquo;s some good variability,</p>
<p>but its antidepressant effects last about a week.</p>
<p>But they kick in immediately.</p>
<p>Now, a week is a long time for like most psychiatric drugs.</p>
<p>Like you take it every day.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still just a week.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing effects a year or more later</p>
<p>with psilocybin and some of the classic psychedelics.</p>
<p>That could be a pharmacological difference,</p>
<p>or it could be that they get a lot more mileage</p>
<p>out of ketamine if they treated it like psychedelic therapy.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s some work that needs-</p>
<p>What would that look like?</p>
<p>Really just like our psilocybin sessions,</p>
<p>which I know I haven&rsquo;t described,</p>
<p>but briefly you have anywhere from four to eight hours</p>
<p>of preparation getting to know the people</p>
<p>who are going to be the guides</p>
<p>or the therapists in the room with the person.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe you could walk us through this.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say I were to come to one of your clinical trials,</p>
<p>because these are clinical trials, right?</p>
<p>At your lab at Hopkins.</p>
<p>And would I need to be depressed</p>
<p>or could I just be somebody who wanted</p>
<p>to explore psychedelics?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had studies for all of these</p>
<p>and a number of other disorders.</p>
<p>So healthy normal studies,</p>
<p>the code for not a problem to fix,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re all here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s amazing about psychedelics though,</p>
<p>because if you administer them under this model</p>
<p>and you develop a relationship</p>
<p>and give a high dose of psychedelic,</p>
<p>you can be a healthy normal without a diagnosable issue.</p>
<p>But man, we&rsquo;re all human</p>
<p>and the issues seem to come to the surface.</p>
<p>So, but we&rsquo;ve done work with smoking cessation.</p>
<p>So people trying to quit tobacco</p>
<p>and haven&rsquo;t been successful.</p>
<p>So a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>So maybe I&rsquo;ll just ask some very simple questions</p>
<p>that would kind of step us through the process.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say I were to sign up for one of these trials</p>
<p>and I qualified for one of these trials,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d show up, you said I would do several hours in advance</p>
<p>of getting to know the team</p>
<p>that would be present during this psychedelic journey.</p>
<p>First there&rsquo;s screening.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of like a couple of days</p>
<p>of both psychiatric, like structured psychiatric interviews</p>
<p>about your past and symptoms across the DSM,</p>
<p>the psychiatric Bible,</p>
<p>to see if you might have various disorders</p>
<p>that could disqualify you.</p>
<p>Like the main ones being the psychotic disorders,</p>
<p>schizophrenia, and also including bipolar.</p>
<p>So the manic side of bipolar.</p>
<p>So after that, and also cardiovascular screening,</p>
<p>heart disease, after that screening,</p>
<p>then the preparation where you get,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re both, you develop a therapeutic rapport</p>
<p>with the people who are going to be in the room with you,</p>
<p>your guides, but you&rsquo;re also then didactically</p>
<p>sort of explained about what the psychedelic could be like.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of a laundry list</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re more known by their variability</p>
<p>than, you know, it&rsquo;s going to, it&rsquo;s not like cocaine.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re going to feel stimulated.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to feel like, you know, you can do any,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, you know, or alcohol.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably going to feel more relaxed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I call them uppers, downers, and all-arounders,</p>
<p>and the psychedelics are all-arounders.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, you could be,</p>
<p>you could have the most beautiful experience of your life</p>
<p>or the most terrifying experience of your life.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this kind of laundry list of like the things</p>
<p>that could happen.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no surprises.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s so important for people to hear</p>
<p>because the all-arounders,</p>
<p>you really can&rsquo;t predict how somebody</p>
<p>is going to react internally.</p>
<p>I want to just briefly touch on something</p>
<p>because we left that topic,</p>
<p>but it occurred to me that a lot of these effects</p>
<p>of psychedelics and how they function, et cetera,</p>
<p>is still very mysterious.</p>
<p>But then I recall to mind that how most prescription</p>
<p>antidepressants work is also very mysterious.</p>
<p>They increase serotonin or dopamine or epinephrine,</p>
<p>et cetera, but why they take weeks on and, you know,</p>
<p>several weeks to kick in, et cetera, is also mysterious.</p>
<p>But going back to the experience</p>
<p>of coming to your laboratory.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s say that somebody passes</p>
<p>all the prerequisites and it&rsquo;s the day.</p>
<p>Comes the day that they&rsquo;re going to have this experience.</p>
<p>Are they eating mushrooms like you hear about</p>
<p>or are they taking it in capsule form?</p>
<p>And what sorts of doses are you prescribing?</p>
<p>Is there a dose response curve?</p>
<p>And then secondary to that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to talk about microdose versus macrodose.</p>
<p>So how do they get this stuff into,</p>
<p>how do people receive it</p>
<p>and how do they get it into their body?</p>
<p>So they receive pure psilocybin.</p>
<p>So the mushroom, and there are many species,</p>
<p>the most, if people have taken mushrooms</p>
<p>in the United States, it&rsquo;s most likely psilocybe cubensis.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re easy to grow.</p>
<p>They grow in cow patties.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy for any body to grow them in their closet.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take a thousand watt light like cannabis.</p>
<p>It takes like a little, you know,</p>
<p>10 watt light bulb and a Tupperware bin.</p>
<p>So those are what, those are the types of mushrooms</p>
<p>that people typically take.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not administering those.</p>
<p>Psilocybin is the compound.</p>
<p>You could draw a molecule, psilocybin,</p>
<p>again, based on the tryptamine structure.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a single molecular entity.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a white powder.</p>
<p>Does it look like serotonin molecularly?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>So if I looked at, if I were to show people</p>
<p>the chemical structure of serotonin</p>
<p>and the chemical structure of psilocybin,</p>
<p>it would look quite similar.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re basically taking serotonin.</p>
<p>A modified version of serotonin, which makes sense.</p>
<p>But then again, this repeated theme of the chemistry</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t always neatly line up</p>
<p>because like mescaline looks more like dopamine</p>
<p>than it does like serotonin,</p>
<p>but yet at the receptor activation level,</p>
<p>the pharmacological effect, those are similar.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, and what it does at the receptor</p>
<p>is an alternate, it&rsquo;s hitting the same switch,</p>
<p>but then having an alternate response at the receptor level.</p>
<p>Yeah, so for people that don&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>understand the relationship between what we call ligand,</p>
<p>the thing that parks in the receptor,</p>
<p>and the receptor is the parking spot,</p>
<p>one of the reasons that you can get such a variety of effects</p>
<p>from different compounds is, for instance,</p>
<p>serotonin might affect a certain pathway</p>
<p>at a particular rate,</p>
<p>and psilocybin might trigger activation</p>
<p>of different components of that pathway at different rates,</p>
<p>and so you can get vastly different experiences</p>
<p>from two things that look chemically similar.</p>
<p>This is also a good reason why people shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just assume that they can cowboy their own chemistry, right?</p>
<p>That what you see on paper</p>
<p>and what you can mix up in a vial</p>
<p>is often vastly different than what you predict.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a dose effect curve that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Some of our early work with psilocybin in healthy normals</p>
<p>looked at a true placebo plus four active doses,</p>
<p>five, 10, 20, and 30 milligrams of psilocybin.</p>
<p>Body weight adjusted,</p>
<p>so those milligrams per 70 kilograms of body weight.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve recently published a paper in our newer trials</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re dropping the body weight adjustment</p>
<p>going across hundreds of volunteers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve kind of figured out that you shouldn&rsquo;t really be,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to be adjusting by body weight.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, brain size doesn&rsquo;t vary that much</p>
<p>between individuals.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You know, at the end, this is a brain effect, mostly.</p>
<p>Probably body as well.</p>
<p>Okay, so the person ingests the powder or capsule.</p>
<p>In a little pill.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it doesn&rsquo;t take, 30 milligrams is a small,</p>
<p>you could fit it into a tiny little capsule.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll take about a half hour,</p>
<p>but anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour to kick in.</p>
<p>And you said the dose range was?</p>
<p>Most of our studies are looking at</p>
<p>where we want a psychedelic effect</p>
<p>are in the 20 to 30 milligram range.</p>
<p>Again, because we have adjusted by body weight</p>
<p>and the average American is over 70 kilograms,</p>
<p>about 150 pounds.</p>
<p>People, in fact, have gotten more like 40, 45</p>
<p>in a lot of cases.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still a small pill.</p>
<p>The session day itself is not full of,</p>
<p>for most of our studies, is not full of tasks.</p>
<p>We really want to look at the therapeutic response.</p>
<p>Obviously, if it&rsquo;s a therapeutic study,</p>
<p>we want it to be a meaningful experience.</p>
<p>And research has found, not surprisingly,</p>
<p>that you get a less meaningful experience</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in an fMRI</p>
<p>or when you&rsquo;re doing a lot of cognitive tasks.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done some research of that type, for sure,</p>
<p>and plenty of colleagues have.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re in a therapeutic study</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re trying to understand the therapeutic effects,</p>
<p>you have to recognize there&rsquo;s this trade-off</p>
<p>of what you can do.</p>
<p>So our typical therapeutic model,</p>
<p>which, again, isn&rsquo;t just limited necessarily</p>
<p>to the therapeutic studies</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re trying to treat a specific disorder,</p>
<p>is to have that preparation</p>
<p>so the person feels very comfortable with their guides.</p>
<p>I mean, ultimately, what I tell people is like,</p>
<p>any emotional response, it&rsquo;s all welcome.</p>
<p>I mean, you could be crying like a baby hysterically.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s what you should be doing</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what you feel like.</p>
<p>And so, in a lot of ways,</p>
<p>sometimes people with psychedelic experience on their own,</p>
<p>it can be harder to train them in this model</p>
<p>because, in the real world,</p>
<p>people with psychedelic experience,</p>
<p>a lot of times the rule is, you know, hold your shit.</p>
<p>So, you know, several friends go to a party,</p>
<p>they split a bag of mushrooms.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, there&rsquo;s a social pressure,</p>
<p>for good reason, not to be the guy,</p>
<p>you know, in the corner of the room</p>
<p>where everyone&rsquo;s trying to just have a good time and relax,</p>
<p>like crying about your mother.</p>
<p>Your other friends, they&rsquo;re having an experience, too,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re being a drama king and blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>And so, like, yeah, compose yourself.</p>
<p>Hold your-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing, I mean, you&rsquo;re doing therapy for people.</p>
<p>This is, it&rsquo;s not just about the experience.</p>
<p>And the experience itself is very much shaped</p>
<p>by that container, by the environment,</p>
<p>and the degree to which one allows it to happen.</p>
<p>Like, one should let go of control.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s talk about the letting go of control,</p>
<p>and then as we march through this hypothetical experience</p>
<p>that does take place in your lab,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re using a sort of generic case example, if you will.</p>
<p>The letting go of control is an interesting feature,</p>
<p>actually, because one of the common themes</p>
<p>of good psychoanalysis, or psychotherapy of any kind,</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a trust built</p>
<p>between the patient and the analyst,</p>
<p>and that relationship becomes a template</p>
<p>for trust more generally, and trust in oneself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually the end goal of good psychoanalysis</p>
<p>is that the patient actually, one of the end goals,</p>
<p>is that they develop an empathy for themselves,</p>
<p>which almost sounds like an oxymoron,</p>
<p>but if you spend a little time with that statement,</p>
<p>it actually pans out.</p>
<p>So, the psychedelic experience</p>
<p>is one in which, chemically,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re under a new set of conditions, right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s, coarsely, space and time</p>
<p>are altered in some way, sense of self.</p>
<p>For instance, I might be going</p>
<p>to a strongly interoceptive mode,</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m focusing on everything</p>
<p>within the confines of my skin,</p>
<p>whereas normally, we&rsquo;re sort of interacting in space,</p>
<p>and pens, and conversation, and I&rsquo;m sort of,</p>
<p>if I had, occasionally, I&rsquo;ll pay attention to my breathing,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sort of dilating and contracting my focus</p>
<p>for different things all the time.</p>
<p>The letting go of control, it seems to me,</p>
<p>could be sort of the expansion of one perceptual bubble</p>
<p>to the point where you&rsquo;re not actually worried</p>
<p>that that perceptual bubble is gonna pop,</p>
<p>or that, meaning, you&rsquo;re not worried</p>
<p>about what people think of you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not worried whether or not</p>
<p>your brain is gonna explode,</p>
<p>even though a thought could feel enormous.</p>
<p>If I keep going like this, it&rsquo;ll almost sound psychedelic,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the idea here.</p>
<p>Or if I&rsquo;m paying attention, for instance,</p>
<p>to some somatic experience,</p>
<p>like the coursing of waves of heat through my body,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not suddenly saying, you know, is that weird?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually just going deeper and deeper into it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s essentially expanding a perceptual phenomenon.</p>
<p>How do you convince people</p>
<p>to go further and further down that path?</p>
<p>What do you think allows them to do that?</p>
<p>Because I think that, to me,</p>
<p>is one of the more unusual aspects to psychedelics,</p>
<p>is that normally the social pressure,</p>
<p>but also just our internal pressure from our own brain</p>
<p>is pay attention to many things at once, not just one.</p>
<p>Especially these days.</p>
<p>Yeah, multitask.</p>
<p>Multitask, and the more that we focus on one thing,</p>
<p>the more bizarre that thing actually can appear to us,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>I mean, even if it&rsquo;s the tip of your finger</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not taking any psychedelics,</p>
<p>if you spend long enough looking at the tip of your finger,</p>
<p>you will notice some very weird things, right?</p>
<p>I think of that as the classic psychedelic effect,</p>
<p>or one classic effect, and one I&rsquo;ve used many times,</p>
<p>of this example of why people shouldn&rsquo;t necessarily,</p>
<p>you know, these aren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>these, one should be judicious</p>
<p>in putting themselves in these circumstances.</p>
<p>Someone could be, you know,</p>
<p>having a very strong psilocybin experience,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re trying to navigate their way in Manhattan,</p>
<p>crossing the street,</p>
<p>and they might be staring into the hand and realize,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s, their hand is the most amazing miracle.</p>
<p>Like the entire universe has essentially conspired</p>
<p>to come to this one point</p>
<p>to make this absolutely breathtaking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like, I think of the simplest form of,</p>
<p>well, we know the simplest form of learning is habituation.</p>
<p>Simply keep applying stimuli and there&rsquo;s less response.</p>
<p>Like, this is what organisms do.</p>
<p>This is what we have to do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s this dis-habituation component</p>
<p>that like-</p>
<p>Dis-habituation.</p>
<p>Yes, like we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get through life</p>
<p>if we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to cross that street</p>
<p>if we were like, oh, like this is a miracle.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m so glad you-</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m so glad you brought this up.</p>
<p>I mean, here I&rsquo;m reflecting my bias as a vision scientist,</p>
<p>but most people don&rsquo;t realize this,</p>
<p>but if you look at something long enough,</p>
<p>it eventually disappears.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t actually disappear,</p>
<p>but perceptually it disappears.</p>
<p>You have these little micro saccades</p>
<p>that ensure that it doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but most of us don&rsquo;t look at any one thing</p>
<p>for very long.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>The brain&rsquo;s default is to perceptually jump around</p>
<p>like crazy with the visual system,</p>
<p>with the auditory system.</p>
<p>We all, ADD, people talk about ADD a lot,</p>
<p>is sort of baked into our underlying networks</p>
<p>at some level.</p>
<p>And then we can force attention,</p>
<p>but it sounds like on psychedelics,</p>
<p>one of the primary goals therapeutically</p>
<p>is to really drill into one of these perceptual bubbles</p>
<p>and expand that bubble.</p>
<p>And the safety, it seems, is the safety,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of like a permission to do that</p>
<p>without worrying that something&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>Right, because I&rsquo;ve had people there on the couch.</p>
<p>Yeah, I remember one lady said,</p>
<p>this is probably 13, 14 years ago,</p>
<p>said, Matt, tell me again, I can&rsquo;t die.</p>
<p>Like, I feel like my heart is going to rip through my chest.</p>
<p>I mean, she was feeling her,</p>
<p>and I should say, typically cardiovascular response</p>
<p>is modest.</p>
<p>The pulse and blood pressure go up somewhat.</p>
<p>It can be dangerous for people</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re at severe heart risk,</p>
<p>and we do monitor-</p>
<p>Are you monitoring this the whole time?</p>
<p>We do, yeah, we do monitor-</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re plugged into a variety of devices?</p>
<p>Yeah, so every half hour or so,</p>
<p>we take their on protocol,</p>
<p>and we space it out a little further,</p>
<p>further into the time course,</p>
<p>but we take their blood pressure and their pulse.</p>
<p>And if it goes over a certain level,</p>
<p>we have a protocol,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve had to do this only a few times,</p>
<p>but the physician comes in,</p>
<p>gives them a little nitroglycerin under the tongue,</p>
<p>and knocks the blood pressure down a little bit,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t affect the experience.</p>
<p>So we have it all in place,</p>
<p>even though they&rsquo;d probably be fine</p>
<p>out of an abundance of caution.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>But yeah, but someone can feel that,</p>
<p>my God, I&rsquo;m going to die.</p>
<p>Like, I have never felt my heart beat like this before.</p>
<p>And like, the experience of the breath can be just,</p>
<p>you know, absolutely fantastic.</p>
<p>This sort of, and the breath is obviously interesting</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s this automatic, you know, control,</p>
<p>but it can also be voluntary.</p>
<p>So people can get into a sense of like,</p>
<p>my God, what if I, it sounds silly,</p>
<p>like a stunner movie.</p>
<p>What if I forget to breathe?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But people, that can be so compelling.</p>
<p>And so one of the reasons,</p>
<p>to get back to one of your questions,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, what do we do to kind of allow them</p>
<p>to go further into these bubbles?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, one is wearing the eye shades.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t call them blindfolds</p>
<p>because that has a negative connotation,</p>
<p>like being kidnapped.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re probably seeing a lot in there anyway.</p>
<p>So blind isn&rsquo;t the appropriate word.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never thought of it.</p>
<p>These should be like inner sight shades.</p>
<p>But when you close the eyes,</p>
<p>the levels of activity in the retina</p>
<p>actually are maintained.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just spontaneous activity.</p>
<p>And it seems, and I&rsquo;d be curious about your thoughts</p>
<p>on this, I mean, but the way I describe it is that</p>
<p>the mind&rsquo;s eye, you know, this kind of loose term we use,</p>
<p>can be on rocket boosters.</p>
<p>So a lot of times, for some people,</p>
<p>like a compound like psilocybin,</p>
<p>for some people, there&rsquo;s no perceptual effect.</p>
<p>Like if they&rsquo;re looking at this room,</p>
<p>it would pretty much look the same.</p>
<p>Sometimes folks say, yeah,</p>
<p>things seem a little bit brighter.</p>
<p>Now, some people will say, oh my God,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s waves, that wall is waving,</p>
<p>and these curtains are, you know.</p>
<p>On these compounds,</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t typically see pink elephants.</p>
<p>You do actually get that in another class.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t mention the anticholinergics,</p>
<p>or like atropine and scopolamine, those drugs.</p>
<p>Those are the true hallucinations</p>
<p>where you thought you were having a conversation</p>
<p>with someone who was never there.</p>
<p>We will definitely get to those.</p>
<p>But the reason I kind of cringed and said,</p>
<p>oh my, when you talked about those is that</p>
<p>knowing a little bit about the pharmacology</p>
<p>of acetylcholine, the idea of manipulating that system</p>
<p>to me sounds very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Because like the whole idea of witches and flying,</p>
<p>there was a whole history there hundreds of years ago,</p>
<p>so-called witches taking these agents</p>
<p>and then thinking they were flying around on broomsticks</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of mythology around the broomsticks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s complicated, but that sounds very unpleasant.</p>
<p>One thing about the serotonergic,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just, with psilocybin,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s an expansion of a particular,</p>
<p>fairly narrow percept.</p>
<p>It could be sound, could be an emotion,</p>
<p>could be sadness, could be a historical event</p>
<p>or a fear of the future.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve mentioned before that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something to be learned in that experience.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about going into that experience</p>
<p>in an undeterred way that allows somebody</p>
<p>to bring something back into more standard reality.</p>
<p>Given the huge variety of experiences</p>
<p>that people have on psychedelics,</p>
<p>given the huge variety of humans that are out there,</p>
<p>but what are now very clear therapeutic effects</p>
<p>in the realm of depression,</p>
<p>what do you think is the value of going into this</p>
<p>fairly restricted perceptual bubble,</p>
<p>what we are calling letting go or giving up control?</p>
<p>Because if the experiences are many,</p>
<p>but the value of what one exports from that experience</p>
<p>is kind of similar across individuals,</p>
<p>that raises all sorts of interesting questions.</p>
<p>And this is not a philosophy discussion.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about biology and psychology here.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say I decide that I&rsquo;m going to focus</p>
<p>on the tip of my pen.</p>
<p>I mean, in a psychedelic state,</p>
<p>I could fall in love with this pen.</p>
<p>I do happen to like these Pilot V5s and V7s very much,</p>
<p>but I could feel real love for the pen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an unreasonable thing to expect</p>
<p>in a psychedelic journey.</p>
<p>And in the context of your laboratory model,</p>
<p>which I think is a great one,</p>
<p>that experience would be just as valid</p>
<p>as me going into the experience</p>
<p>of some of the deep friction that I might have</p>
<p>with a family member over my entire lifespan.</p>
<p>And yet the export from those two</p>
<p>vastly different experiences</p>
<p>is one of feeling a better relationship</p>
<p>to the world and to oneself.</p>
<p>So what does this tell us about-</p>
<p>How can the pen and the processing,</p>
<p>your childhood trauma, both lead to-</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what does this, I mean, at that level,</p>
<p>it raises this question, like, first of all, how, why?</p>
<p>I mean, or just what are your thoughts on that?</p>
<p>So this is definitely in the,</p>
<p>this is in the terrain we&rsquo;re figuring out, you know?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no, educated speculation</p>
<p>is the best I can provide.</p>
<p>But I think the best,</p>
<p>the most, I think the common denominator</p>
<p>are persisting changes in self-representation.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Tell me more about self-representation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way one holds the sense of self,</p>
<p>the fundamental relationship of a person in the world.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that these experiences</p>
<p>seem to alter the models we hold of reality.</p>
<p>And I think that the self is the biggest model,</p>
<p>that I am a thing that&rsquo;s separate from other things.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I am defined by certain,</p>
<p>I have a certain personality,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a smoker that&rsquo;s having a hard time quitting,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m a depressed person that, you know,</p>
<p>views myself as a failure and all of these things.</p>
<p>Those are models too.</p>
<p>And I think that change in self-representation</p>
<p>may be an endpoint for these different experiences.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe the falling in love with the pen,</p>
<p>the whole idea that you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>especially in contemplation afterwards,</p>
<p>and obviously I&rsquo;m speculating here,</p>
<p>but the whole idea that you could</p>
<p>have such a deep connection with this random,</p>
<p>obviously random aspect of the universe</p>
<p>could potentially lead to this, you know,</p>
<p>transformed understanding of the self.</p>
<p>And like the pen may be a proxy</p>
<p>for the miracle of reality,</p>
<p>in a way that relies nothing on no supernatural thinking.</p>
<p>You know, you can be a hard atheist and take this,</p>
<p>and ultimately, oh my God, like that,</p>
<p>just like the pen, this is, you know,</p>
<p>this is amazing, the fact that we exist,</p>
<p>and so there could be an extrapolation chair.</p>
<p>And you use the pen,</p>
<p>but I think it sounds so similar</p>
<p>to Aldous Huxley&rsquo;s classic description</p>
<p>in the Doors of Perception of the chair and the drapes.</p>
<p>Like he took 500 milligrams of mesclun,</p>
<p>he was just like-</p>
<p>Is that a high dose of mesclun?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know, that&rsquo;s a heroic dose for sure.</p>
<p>And he just going off on the chairiness of the chair,</p>
<p>like this chair is exuding the quality of being a chair.</p>
<p>So this is this expansion of the perceptual bubble,</p>
<p>a narrow percept that then grows</p>
<p>within the confines of that narrow percept.</p>
<p>So sense of self is a very interesting phenomenon,</p>
<p>and if we could dissect it a little bit,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the somatic sense of self,</p>
<p>so the ability to literally feel the self,</p>
<p>this process we call interoception.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the title of the self, the I am blank.</p>
<p>And I noticed you said that several times,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s intriguing to me.</p>
<p>I have a good friend,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I can or should mention his name,</p>
<p>but he had a very long and successful career</p>
<p>within one of the more elite teams within the SEAL teams.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a fairly philosophical guy,</p>
<p>also a very practical guy,</p>
<p>but he has said many times to me</p>
<p>that the most powerful words in any language are I am,</p>
<p>because whatever follows that tends,</p>
<p>if you repeat it enough,</p>
<p>tends to have this kind of feedback effect</p>
<p>on how you are in the world.</p>
<p>And at the first pass,</p>
<p>it sounded to me a little bit like,</p>
<p>kind of like internet psychology type thing,</p>
<p>like the secret or something,</p>
<p>which frankly, I&rsquo;m just not particularly-</p>
<p>A little new agey.</p>
<p>Yeah, so if you kind of like,</p>
<p>the whole fake it till you make it,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually subscribe to any of that.</p>
<p>But in dissecting that a little bit further with him,</p>
<p>I came to realize that these words, I am,</p>
<p>are very powerful.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you reprogram your brain just by saying them,</p>
<p>but how one defines themselves,</p>
<p>internally, not just to other people,</p>
<p>but how one psychologically,</p>
<p>and by default, defines themselves,</p>
<p>I think is a very powerful.</p>
<p>And depressed people, as well as happy people,</p>
<p>seem to define themselves</p>
<p>in terms of these categories of emotional states.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s so interesting that letting go</p>
<p>and going into this perceptual bubble,</p>
<p>which is facilitated by, obviously,</p>
<p>a really wonderful team of therapists,</p>
<p>but also the serotonergic agent,</p>
<p>allows us to potentially reshape the perception of self.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tremendous feat of neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Right, and I think certainly more work needs to be done,</p>
<p>and this is the horizon.</p>
<p>And I should credit Chris Letheby,</p>
<p>a philosopher in Australia,</p>
<p>who has a forthcoming book,</p>
<p>it might be out right about now or soon,</p>
<p>within the coming months,</p>
<p>Psychedelics and Philosophy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the title of the book?</p>
<p>It might be Psychedelic Philosophy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really close.</p>
<p>Chris Letheby, we&rsquo;ll put a link to it.</p>
<p>Right, and so his conclusion in this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really great book,</p>
<p>and he really plays with the idea.</p>
<p>Psychedelic experiences come along</p>
<p>with a lot of supernatural stuff, experience.</p>
<p>It can certainly go along with that,</p>
<p>but the idea is, can these experiences,</p>
<p>including the therapeutic effects,</p>
<p>be explained from a naturalist point of view?</p>
<p>And his conclusion is that changes in self-representation</p>
<p>may be the commonality.</p>
<p>Now, that could go along with plant spirits</p>
<p>and the Buddha and chakras</p>
<p>and whatever your model system,</p>
<p>Jesus, all of that,</p>
<p>but it could also be completely devoid</p>
<p>of any supernatural, any religious.</p>
<p>And we do, in fact, see all of these varieties.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s something about this change</p>
<p>in sense of self.</p>
<p>There is, it seems to be something on the identity level,</p>
<p>both with, I think of the work we did with cancer patients</p>
<p>who had substantial depression and anxiety</p>
<p>because of their cancer,</p>
<p>and also our work with people</p>
<p>trying to quit cigarette smoking.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s this real,</p>
<p>there seems to be, when it really works,</p>
<p>this change in how people view themselves,</p>
<p>like with smoking,</p>
<p>like really stepping out of this model.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m a smoker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough to quit smoking cigarettes.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>I failed a bunch of times.</p>
<p>I remember one participant during the session,</p>
<p>but he held onto this afterwards,</p>
<p>and he said, my God, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I can really just decide, like flicking off a button.</p>
<p>I can decide not to smoke.</p>
<p>And I call these duh experiences with psychedelics</p>
<p>because people often, like in the cancer state,</p>
<p>you say, I&rsquo;m causing most of my own suffering.</p>
<p>Like, I can follow my appointments.</p>
<p>I can do everything, but I can still plan for the vacation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not getting outside in the sunshine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not playing with my grandkids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m choosing to do that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, they told themselves that before,</p>
<p>and the smoker has told themselves a million times,</p>
<p>I can choose.</p>
<p>So it sounds, when it comes out of their mouths,</p>
<p>and folks will say,</p>
<p>this is part of the ineffability</p>
<p>of a psychedelic experience.</p>
<p>Folks say, I know this sounds like bullshit,</p>
<p>and this sounds like, but my God, I could just decide.</p>
<p>Like, they&rsquo;re feeling this gravity of agency,</p>
<p>which I think is interesting</p>
<p>because regardless of the debates</p>
<p>on the reality of free will,</p>
<p>I think the philosophy of that,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s ultimately free will,</p>
<p>like pure agency, if that exists,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m skeptical of,</p>
<p>or just the idea that clearly we have a sense of agency.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something there,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the sense of agency even,</p>
<p>that the human being has.</p>
<p>And that seems to be, at times,</p>
<p>fundamentally like supercharged</p>
<p>from a psychedelic experience.</p>
<p>This idea, like, I&rsquo;m just going to make a decision.</p>
<p>Normally, like you tell a depressed person,</p>
<p>like, don&rsquo;t think of yourself that way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not a failure.</p>
<p>Look at all the, it&rsquo;s just, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, and you can actually,</p>
<p>in one of these states,</p>
<p>have an experience where you realize,</p>
<p>like, my God, just like using MDMA to treat PTSD,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to be starting work</p>
<p>with psilocybin to treat PTSD.</p>
<p>Someone could really reprocess their trauma</p>
<p>in a way that has lasting effects.</p>
<p>And clearly there&rsquo;s probably something,</p>
<p>you know, reconsolidation of those memories.</p>
<p>They are altered, you know,</p>
<p>very consistent with our understanding</p>
<p>of the way memory works.</p>
<p>So the whole idea of people can actually,</p>
<p>in a few hours, have such a profound experience</p>
<p>that they decide to make these changes</p>
<p>in who they are, and it sticks.</p>
<p>There seems to be something like that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s profound.</p>
<p>I mean, I think a few moments ago,</p>
<p>I made some semi-disparaging statements</p>
<p>about things like the secret,</p>
<p>and affirmations,</p>
<p>and the reason I do that with a nod</p>
<p>to the fact that the people</p>
<p>who are putting those ideas forward</p>
<p>are well-intentioned people</p>
<p>is that the neural networks of the brain</p>
<p>put language last.</p>
<p>We tell stories, you know,</p>
<p>and stories are very powerful,</p>
<p>but I think one of the most cruel aspects</p>
<p>of the whole self-help literature</p>
<p>and popular psychology is this idea</p>
<p>that everything you say,</p>
<p>your brain and body hear it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually a very unkind</p>
<p>or even cruel thing for people</p>
<p>who are depressed or anxious to hear,</p>
<p>because if they hear that and believe that,</p>
<p>and I want to be clear,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>that they think that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to control thoughts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to control thoughts.</p>
<p>So if somebody says, you know, I can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and then somebody says,</p>
<p>well, no, every time you say you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>your brain hears that and it reinforces it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very treacherous place to live.</p>
<p>And language is powerful,</p>
<p>but neural networks, the brain,</p>
<p>and the networks that underlie emotionality</p>
<p>and perception and sense of self,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t change in response to language.</p>
<p>They change in response to experience.</p>
<p>And it just fundamentally,</p>
<p>you need, there are some prerequisites.</p>
<p>You need certain neuromodulators present,</p>
<p>like serotonin or dopamine.</p>
<p>You need them to be at sufficient levels.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need a drug necessarily to do it.</p>
<p>You could, you know,</p>
<p>you give a kid a kitten or a puppy,</p>
<p>their first kitten or puppy,</p>
<p>and the levels of dopamine and serotonin,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never measured them,</p>
<p>but we can be pretty sure that they are higher than baseline</p>
<p>and that experience will reshape them.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Likewise with an adult in a certain circumstances.</p>
<p>So I think I&rsquo;m fascinated by this idea</p>
<p>that a somatic and a perceptual experience,</p>
<p>but a real experience of the sort that you&rsquo;re describing</p>
<p>is what allows us to reshape our neural circuitry</p>
<p>and to feel differently about ourselves.</p>
<p>And I know there&rsquo;s been really tremendous success</p>
<p>in many individuals of alleviating depression,</p>
<p>of treating trauma with these different compounds.</p>
<p>I want to step from the experience</p>
<p>under the effects of the psychedelic.</p>
<p>So the person there with your team,</p>
<p>they go into this expanded perceptual bubble.</p>
<p>If things go well,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re able to do that to a really deep degree.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s the relived trauma.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s the beauty of their ability</p>
<p>to connect to things in the world.</p>
<p>Now I want to talk about the transition out of that state</p>
<p>and then the export into life,</p>
<p>because this is really where the power of psychedelic</p>
<p>seems to be in the therapeutic sense,</p>
<p>is the ability to learn, truly learn from that experience</p>
<p>so that the learning becomes the default,</p>
<p>that one doesn&rsquo;t have to remind themselves,</p>
<p>oh, I am, you know, they don&rsquo;t have to do an affirmation.</p>
<p>I am a happy person.</p>
<p>I am a happy, you know,</p>
<p>I always think of Bart Simpson,</p>
<p>like writing on the chalkboard, right?</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t work for him, doesn&rsquo;t work for this other stuff too.</p>
<p>But so as they transition out of this state,</p>
<p>I know that there&rsquo;s a kind of a heightened,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a so-called peak where everything seems</p>
<p>to be kind of cascading in at such a level</p>
<p>that the person just,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t really turn it off at that point.</p>
<p>It would be challenging.</p>
<p>And then they start to exit the effects of the drug.</p>
<p>Are those transition zones,</p>
<p>are those valuable?</p>
<p>Much like is the transition between a dream</p>
<p>and the waking state valuable?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re in a sort of mishmash</p>
<p>of altered reality and new reality.</p>
<p>What do you do to guide people through the,</p>
<p>out the tunnel as they exit the tunnel?</p>
<p>And I have to say like,</p>
<p>this is where we need more experimentation.</p>
<p>Really the clinical model goes back</p>
<p>to literally the late 1950s.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been virtually no experimentation on,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, randomized people to,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk more during the latter half</p>
<p>of the session versus not.</p>
<p>Versus we have them write an essay</p>
<p>after their session versus not.</p>
<p>Versus we have this amount of integration.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the discussion?</p>
<p>In your studies, are they writing</p>
<p>or talking as they&rsquo;re doing it?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s called very loosey-goosey term integration.</p>
<p>But for us means,</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re coming back from the experience,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of five, six hours in.</p>
<p>So this is the afternoon,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been dosed around nine o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>So this is like four o&rsquo;clock or so.</p>
<p>Just some initial, tell us about the experience.</p>
<p>Do you want to not unpacking it totally,</p>
<p>but kind of initially just have a little bit discussion</p>
<p>before they go home.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a little bit of that.</p>
<p>But then that night their homework is to write something.</p>
<p>So it could be a few bullet points.</p>
<p>It could be 20 pages and we get everything in there.</p>
<p>In that range.</p>
<p>But try not to be self-critical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not great.</p>
<p>It like, this is just to process</p>
<p>and for a point of discussion the next day.</p>
<p>So they write something,</p>
<p>they come in the next day for a one to two hour,</p>
<p>depending on the study integration session.</p>
<p>Basically, let&rsquo;s discuss your experience.</p>
<p>And depending on what study it&rsquo;s in,</p>
<p>like what might that mean for you&rsquo;re dealing with cancer?</p>
<p>What might that mean for you&rsquo;re smoking?</p>
<p>Or becoming a non-smoker.</p>
<p>So you encourage them to simply take it seriously.</p>
<p>And I think this is, again,</p>
<p>is sort of one of the points that could be the antithesis</p>
<p>of what some just kind of social users use.</p>
<p>I mean, this was written about by Houston Smith,</p>
<p>the scholar of religion,</p>
<p>in terms of these mystical experiences</p>
<p>that can happen from psychedelics</p>
<p>and how a lot of times the attribution</p>
<p>to a drug effect is dismissed.</p>
<p>Even if one has this sense of being one with the universe</p>
<p>and it totally shakes their soul, so to speak.</p>
<p>But the next day their friends are like,</p>
<p>oh dude, you were screwed up.</p>
<p>Too much acid for you, woo.</p>
<p>Like man, next time you needed to have a few more beers</p>
<p>to bring that down.</p>
<p>This sort of social reinforcement</p>
<p>for dismissing the experience.</p>
<p>Oh God, you were talking out of your head, man.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s good natured, but it&rsquo;s this dismissal,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like, what you want to do is like,</p>
<p>tell me more about that.</p>
<p>You were crying at one point and talking about your mom.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about that.</p>
<p>What was that like?</p>
<p>Do you remember that?</p>
<p>Are you doing that follow-up</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re encouraged to do that in their own life</p>
<p>with the various people in their life?</p>
<p>Both.</p>
<p>So we do that explicitly in the follow-up</p>
<p>where we have these discussions.</p>
<p>Depending on what the situation is,</p>
<p>you might encourage the person to kind of follow up.</p>
<p>The basics of it is supportive therapy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s non-structured.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s use all the reflective listening</p>
<p>and the sort of the humanistic psychology,</p>
<p>unconditional positive regard for the person.</p>
<p>But I think if someone feels inclined</p>
<p>to apologize to their sibling about something,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, yeah, go ahead and call them up.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s something big, like a relationship change,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like, sit on that two weeks.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make any big, don&rsquo;t end any relationship.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t quit your job.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make any big.</p>
<p>Do you also tell them not to start any relationships?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember that ever coming up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not Joey.</p>
<p>I was just wondering, but it makes sense</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re dating and they&rsquo;re thinking like,</p>
<p>ah, it might be time to take it to the next level.</p>
<p>Should I ask this girl to marry me?</p>
<p>If it did come up, I would say there too.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you sit on that a week or two?</p>
<p>And let your sober mind.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get a puppy.</p>
<p>Certainly don&rsquo;t get four puppies until you&rsquo;re.</p>
<p>I have a question about flashbacks.</p>
<p>One of the kind of things you hear is flashbacks</p>
<p>and that people, do people get flashbacks?</p>
<p>And if so, what is the basis of flashbacks?</p>
<p>The on the street lore about this is that somehow</p>
<p>some of the compound gets stored in body fat tissues</p>
<p>and then released later.</p>
<p>Is that complete nonsense?</p>
<p>No evidence for that.</p>
<p>So probably complete nonsense.</p>
<p>Flashbacks are nonsense</p>
<p>or the storage in body fat is complete nonsense?</p>
<p>The storage in body fat.</p>
<p>So to answer whether flashbacks are complete nonsense,</p>
<p>we have to define it.</p>
<p>So I really think these are multiple constructs</p>
<p>that are going on.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not the same thing that fall under that term.</p>
<p>There is a phenomenon that appears real</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called hallucinogen persisting perceptual disorder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the DSM.</p>
<p>A certain number of people,</p>
<p>very small number of people, percentage wise,</p>
<p>who have used psychedelics</p>
<p>will have these persisting perceptual disorders.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;ll see halos around things.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll see some trails, like the after images</p>
<p>following an object in motion.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll see distortions in color</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll be like anything else</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a disorder in the DSM.</p>
<p>It has to be clinically distressing</p>
<p>and it has to be persisting over some number of months.</p>
<p>And so very rare, very mysterious.</p>
<p>Some of the keys to that are,</p>
<p>amazingly, it&rsquo;s never been seen</p>
<p>in the thousands of participants,</p>
<p>either from the older era,</p>
<p>from the late 50s to the early 70s.</p>
<p>People in psychedelic studies with LSD,</p>
<p>psilocybin, mescaline,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s never been seen in the modern era.</p>
<p>Again, now with thousands of participants</p>
<p>at a number of centers like ours throughout the world.</p>
<p>So it seems to be something that is,</p>
<p>for some reason, happening in illicit use.</p>
<p>So that brings in, okay, is there polypharmacology?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re drinking during it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re taking-</p>
<p>Did you take what you thought you took?</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s the dose?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the purity?</p>
<p>But then also, what I think is actually,</p>
<p>even more so than that,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s likely going on</p>
<p>is some sort of very rare neurological susceptibility.</p>
<p>There is one paper that is a case series</p>
<p>of individuals reporting these symptoms,</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t limit it</p>
<p>to just people who had hallucinogen history.</p>
<p>And the amazing thing about this</p>
<p>is that a number of people</p>
<p>seem to have straight-up HPPD diagnosis.</p>
<p>What is HPPD?</p>
<p>Hallucinogen-persisting perceptual disorder</p>
<p>who have never taken a psychedelic.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s often prompted by alcohol,</p>
<p>benzodiazepines, cannabis, even tobacco.</p>
<p>And I believe in one individual,</p>
<p>no lifetime history of any,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t preceded by any of those substance uses.</p>
<p>So I think of it like the precipitation exacerbation</p>
<p>of psychotic disorders.</p>
<p>It seems pretty clear through observation</p>
<p>that some people with either predisposition</p>
<p>or active psychotic disease,</p>
<p>that this can destabilize them.</p>
<p>The same way that a life experience</p>
<p>can destabilize this person more easily,</p>
<p>I think of it like that there&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>some pretty rare neurological susceptibility.</p>
<p>We have tended, going, this goes back to the 80s,</p>
<p>clinical practice, it ended up in the DSM</p>
<p>focused on hallucinogen</p>
<p>because I relate it to the psychology of xenophobia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always the weird other thing</p>
<p>that gets the attribution.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t attribute to the thing,</p>
<p>like, oh yeah, did you smoke cigarettes?</p>
<p>Did you drink?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, yeah, but I see lots of people drinking</p>
<p>and not ending up with this.</p>
<p>Like you take a crazy drug</p>
<p>and you can get people to believe all sorts of crazy stuff.</p>
<p>The biggest example of that is the cathinone derivatives,</p>
<p>so-called bath salts.</p>
<p>And if you remember several years back,</p>
<p>the guy in Florida that ate the other guy&rsquo;s face,</p>
<p>there was a homeless guy that like literally ate part</p>
<p>of someone&rsquo;s face off, like, yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the crazies.</p>
<p>While the person was alive.</p>
<p>While the person was alive.</p>
<p>And all it took was one sheriff&rsquo;s deputy to say,</p>
<p>well, I don&rsquo;t know, but I bet it was</p>
<p>some of that bath salts stuff that&rsquo;s been going on.</p>
<p>The only thing-</p>
<p>What was it?</p>
<p>The only thing in his system-</p>
<p>Maybe we can set the record straight for people.</p>
<p>What was this?</p>
<p>Why would he say bath salts?</p>
<p>And was it bath salts?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so the only thing in his talks was cannabis,</p>
<p>which we all know,</p>
<p>typically people don&rsquo;t eat people&rsquo;s faces off</p>
<p>after they get stuff-</p>
<p>Makes you hungrier, but not that hungry.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just an example of the xenophobia.</p>
<p>Like today, if you get on Google images and look up,</p>
<p>you know, bath salts,</p>
<p>one of the most common images you&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>is this poor guy&rsquo;s face being eaten off.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re just so ready to latch on,</p>
<p>just like the people of another culture</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very easy to assign attribution to a class</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re very unfamiliar with.</p>
<p>So I think the psychedelics got that attribution</p>
<p>with this very rare neurological susceptibility</p>
<p>the way that alcohol didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s not specific to psychedelics,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t really know.</p>
<p>But we look at it in our research,</p>
<p>have never seen an example of it.</p>
<p>But flashbacks can mean a number of other things.</p>
<p>I think the most common thing people experience</p>
<p>is what we call it state-dependent learning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s returning yourself to a similar context</p>
<p>can bring back the same thoughts and emotions</p>
<p>as the experience.</p>
<p>So, you know, someone used mushrooms a week ago,</p>
<p>now they do something like they smoke some cannabis</p>
<p>or they take a warm bath</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re simply like relaxed.</p>
<p>It seems to come out of the blue</p>
<p>and all of a sudden these,</p>
<p>or they follow a thought trail that takes them,</p>
<p>that reminds them and they find themselves</p>
<p>in that same experience again.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s more state-dependent learning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the distressing component that is in,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s typically not perceptual.</p>
<p>And then another class are just sort of</p>
<p>perceptual anomalies within a day or two</p>
<p>following the experience, which is not HPPD.</p>
<p>Most people have joked that this is a free trip.</p>
<p>Like you might see a few trails or halos the day afterwards.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t last longer than that.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t screw you up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of fun.</p>
<p>Like, oh yeah, I&rsquo;m still seeing some trip.</p>
<p>Most people will say.</p>
<p>So it could mean any of those things.</p>
<p>So flashback is, yeah.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>No, I appreciate you clarifying that.</p>
<p>I mean, one very common misconception</p>
<p>about neuroplasticity is that it&rsquo;s an event</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not an event, it&rsquo;s a process.</p>
<p>And we have no understanding</p>
<p>of the duration of that process.</p>
<p>However, the experience of any drug</p>
<p>or any life experience, right?</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s a trauma or a wonderful experience</p>
<p>or a psychedelic experience, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Sets in motion a series of dominoes that fall,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the falling of those dominoes</p>
<p>that we call neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>I mean, the reshaping of neural circuits could take years.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the trigger, and then there&rsquo;s the actual change.</p>
<p>And so I think that some of what you described</p>
<p>could be literally the reordering of circuitry</p>
<p>that in some individuals might extend longer than others.</p>
<p>And there is one phenomenon</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been told people experience,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m wondering whether or not any of the patients</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve worked with or people in your trials</p>
<p>have reported this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done ayahuasca,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m assuming has some overlap</p>
<p>with the serotonin system.</p>
<p>Probably hits a variety of systems.</p>
<p>And the DMT system.</p>
<p>The DMT system, yeah, it&rsquo;s orally active.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>MAO inhibitors that allow the DMT to be orally.</p>
<p>Right, I should have recalled that, absolutely.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve never done it,</p>
<p>but a number of people I know that have done ayahuasca,</p>
<p>as well as people I know who&rsquo;ve done MDMA,</p>
<p>report an increased sense of what is sometimes called ASMR,</p>
<p>these autonomic sensory meridian reflexes,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>A lot of people have these naturally,</p>
<p>and they hide these.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually something</p>
<p>that many people keep hidden to themselves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just ask you if you can do it.</p>
<p>So some people are able to pass a shiver down their spine</p>
<p>or up their spine consciously.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m able to actually pass a shiver up my spine.</p>
<p>I actually learned how to do this</p>
<p>when I was a kid on a hot day.</p>
<p>I was standing on a field in sports camp,</p>
<p>and I was like, it&rsquo;s really hot here.</p>
<p>And I could actually create like a cooled perception.</p>
<p>Some people, I&rsquo;ve told someone this once,</p>
<p>and then this led to a discussion of,</p>
<p>oh, I can do it, but I always hid that from people</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s actually somewhat pleasurable.</p>
<p>And this is a well-known phenomenon, ASMR.</p>
<p>And some people I know who have taken MDMA therapeutically</p>
<p>or ayahuasca will report that they feel great relief</p>
<p>from this, they can generate these autonomic reflexes</p>
<p>through their body more readily.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing because they were able to tune in</p>
<p>to a kind of deeper sense of somatic self.</p>
<p>Now on the internet, ASMR, if you look it up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit like the bath salt thing,</p>
<p>but in the other direction.</p>
<p>There were people that pay,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say there are accounts on YouTube</p>
<p>that have many, many millions of viewers,</p>
<p>of people that will whisper to them about,</p>
<p>like for instance, there&rsquo;s people that will go listen to,</p>
<p>it seems to be women in particular,</p>
<p>whispering about like car mechanics or something</p>
<p>or about, or scratching.</p>
<p>So there are certain sounds will do this,</p>
<p>whispering, tapping, finger tapping,</p>
<p>and people experience immense pleasure from it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really sexual pleasure,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s this kind of deep core of the body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>down the core of the spine.</p>
<p>Probably what a certain number of people</p>
<p>would call kundalini,</p>
<p>which is another scientifically, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, and people who do</p>
<p>long duration kundalini breathing sessions,</p>
<p>many of them will report later feeling</p>
<p>as if their perception of self is outside of their head,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re literally walking,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very uncomfortable for them,</p>
<p>that they feel like they&rsquo;re walking around</p>
<p>with their sense of self extended beyond the body.</p>
<p>And this is a clinically described neurologic phenomenon.</p>
<p>Have any studies been done?</p>
<p>I would imagine that person might actually like,</p>
<p>would they duck?</p>
<p>Oh, what?</p>
<p>Like that would be an interesting experiment.</p>
<p>That would be the kind of thing</p>
<p>my lab would want to get into, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yeah, their body could clear,</p>
<p>but their projection wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah, the sense of self,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a well-known phenomenon,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very, in a few individuals, very sad,</p>
<p>where people actually avidly seek out</p>
<p>amputation of their limbs</p>
<p>because their limbs they feel don&rsquo;t belong to their body.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>This is very sad and fortunately very rare,</p>
<p>but also a very sad condition.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think that the core of this conversation</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re drilling into is this notion</p>
<p>of reordering the self,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a relief to me to know that flashbacks</p>
<p>are not something that is kind of,</p>
<p>forgive the term, baked in to the psychedelic experience.</p>
<p>And I suppose that&rsquo;s a good segue</p>
<p>to ask about other sorts of drugs.</p>
<p>Having said baked in,</p>
<p>the temptation is to go to marijuana or cannabis,</p>
<p>but if we could, I&rsquo;d like to just ask</p>
<p>about some of the more dopaminergic compounds,</p>
<p>in particular MDMA.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My understanding is that MDMA</p>
<p>is a purely synthetic compound,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not going to find MDMA in nature.</p>
<p>So far.</p>
<p>So far.</p>
<p>DMT was first synthesized in the lab,</p>
<p>and then we thought it didn&rsquo;t exist in nature,</p>
<p>and then Richard Schultes found it everywhere</p>
<p>in South America.</p>
<p>Who knows, a plan out there might be making MDMA,</p>
<p>but as far as we know now, no.</p>
<p>Right, and we&rsquo;ll talk about DMT</p>
<p>and its sources within the body,</p>
<p>but MDMA could exist elsewhere,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s been synthesized.</p>
<p>And my understanding is that MDMA</p>
<p>leads to very robust increases</p>
<p>in both dopamine and serotonin simultaneously,</p>
<p>which from a neural network&rsquo;s perspective</p>
<p>is a very unusual situation, right?</p>
<p>Normally, because dopamine puts us in this exteroceptive,</p>
<p>looking outside ourselves,</p>
<p>seeking things in the world beyond the skin, our own skin,</p>
<p>and serotonin tends to focus us inward,</p>
<p>those are almost mutually exclusive</p>
<p>kind of neurochemical states,</p>
<p>although they&rsquo;re always at different levels.</p>
<p>So why would it be that having this increased dopamine</p>
<p>and increased serotonin would provide an experience</p>
<p>that is beneficial?</p>
<p>And how do you, to the extent that you can describe it,</p>
<p>how do you think that experience differs</p>
<p>from the sorts of experiences that people have on psilocybin</p>
<p>or more serotonergic agents, just broadly speaking?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>In terms of the effects generally on serotonin and dopamine,</p>
<p>I can only speculate,</p>
<p>like sort of is that dopaminergic component necessary</p>
<p>for, let&rsquo;s say, we know that the amygdala is less reactive</p>
<p>under acute effects, and that may play a role in,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s less sort of control from the amygdala</p>
<p>in terms of one&rsquo;s experience of memory,</p>
<p>so it may be part of this sort of reprocessing,</p>
<p>this reconsolidation of these memories in a different way,</p>
<p>where the amygdala is not going crazy,</p>
<p>saying, freak out, fight or flight.</p>
<p>What I should have said,</p>
<p>it seems like MDMA is being used, clinically anyway,</p>
<p>mainly for trauma, not just for depression.</p>
<p>Although part of that, we really don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>and maybe that MDMA is great for depression</p>
<p>and some of these other,</p>
<p>and it may be that,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to be looking at this soon,</p>
<p>that psilocybin is great for treating PTSD.</p>
<p>A lot of underground therapists say that,</p>
<p>underground psychedelic therapists.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t really know yet which-</p>
<p>What do you mean by underground?</p>
<p>Oh, because they&rsquo;re doing it-</p>
<p>People doing illegal,</p>
<p>but more like a professional therapist would,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just illegal, and this is a kind of a growing thing.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t really know which.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s speculating, but it may be that MDMA</p>
<p>for a broader number of people is better for trauma,</p>
<p>because the chances of having</p>
<p>an extremely challenging experience,</p>
<p>what I call the bad trip,</p>
<p>like really freaking out, is much lower with MDMA.</p>
<p>People can have bad trips,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re of a different nature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not sort of like freaking out,</p>
<p>because all of reality is sort of shattering,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s less of this,</p>
<p>it can take so many forms with the classic psychedelics,</p>
<p>but typically you&rsquo;ll hear something like,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know it was going to be like this,</p>
<p>no matter how hard you tried to prepare them,</p>
<p>that this is, get me off this ride.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about LSD or psilocybin?</p>
<p>LSD, psilocybin, Iowa.</p>
<p>Bad trip.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, and just this sense of,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going insane.</p>
<p>This is so far beyond anything I&rsquo;ve ever experienced,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s scaring the shit out of me.</p>
<p>How often does that happen?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a toehold on anything,</p>
<p>even that I exist as an entity,</p>
<p>and that can be really,</p>
<p>I think, frankly, experientially,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of the gateway</p>
<p>to both the transcendental mystical experiences,</p>
<p>the sense of unity with all things,</p>
<p>which we know, our data suggests,</p>
<p>is related to long-term positive outcomes.</p>
<p>Wait, I want to make sure I understand.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying the bad trip</p>
<p>can be related to the transcendental experience?</p>
<p>Right, I think those are both speculating,</p>
<p>but you have to pass through this reality shattering,</p>
<p>including your sense of self,</p>
<p>and one can handle that in one of two ways.</p>
<p>You can either completely surrender to it,</p>
<p>or you can try to hang on,</p>
<p>and if you try to hang on,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be more like a bad trip.</p>
<p>So again, I wish there was more,</p>
<p>and hopefully there will be more experimentation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot going on here in the black box</p>
<p>in terms of the operant behavior</p>
<p>of how you are within yourself</p>
<p>choosing to handle, like letting go,</p>
<p>and eventually we&rsquo;ll be able to see this in real time</p>
<p>with brain imaging.</p>
<p>Ah, there they are surrendering</p>
<p>to the cyclic experience.</p>
<p>Here they are trying to hold on,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not there yet,</p>
<p>but I think through clinical observation,</p>
<p>it seems pretty clear</p>
<p>that something like that is going on,</p>
<p>and certain drugs like DMT, smoke DMT,</p>
<p>can be so strong.</p>
<p>The reason I think that can be so extraordinary</p>
<p>you can compare to the others</p>
<p>is because it forces people.</p>
<p>There is no choice to hang on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done it.</p>
<p>I was told that DMT is like a high-speed locomotive</p>
<p>into the psychedelic experience</p>
<p>and out of the psychedelic experience,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no ability to hold on to the self</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re in the kind of peak phase.</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>A lot of people say that,</p>
<p>but Terence McKenna,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s kind of the classic bard on DMT effects,</p>
<p>he would say the sense of self was intact,</p>
<p>but everything else, the sensorium,</p>
<p>and what you navigated,</p>
<p>what you oriented towards,</p>
<p>everything else changed, basically,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s hard to, when everything&rsquo;s changing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to say, like,</p>
<p>what is the self that&rsquo;s changing?</p>
<p>What is the rest of the world?</p>
<p>Well, and language is totally deficient</p>
<p>to describe experience anyway,</p>
<p>much less on a psychedelic.</p>
<p>What is McKenna&rsquo;s background?</p>
<p>Like, what is his qualification for being this,</p>
<p>as you referred, this bard of DMT and psychedelics?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re talking about Terence,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s also the brother, Dennis,</p>
<p>whom I know who&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Can only imagine what Thanksgiving dinner is like</p>
<p>at their house.</p>
<p>Terence passed away years, a couple decades ago now,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s sort of the one who&rsquo;s known as being a bard,</p>
<p>and you can find hundreds,</p>
<p>if not thousands of hours of him</p>
<p>on the lecture circuit in the 80s and 90s on YouTube.</p>
<p>But his background was really-</p>
<p>Oh, gosh, I don&rsquo;t recall what his college degree was in,</p>
<p>but he basically, when he was, like, 19,</p>
<p>he traveled to South America,</p>
<p>and actually on the initial trip with his brother,</p>
<p>who was even younger than him,</p>
<p>with some other friends,</p>
<p>and just in search for a DMT snuff</p>
<p>that they had read about in the Harvard archives</p>
<p>from the work of Schultes,</p>
<p>from a generation before,</p>
<p>but they had discovered all of these mushrooms growing,</p>
<p>that down there, the psilocybin mushrooms,</p>
<p>what they recognized,</p>
<p>and just took a lot of mushrooms and-</p>
<p>And talked about it.</p>
<p>Talked about it.</p>
<p>Terence was basically a very intelligent,</p>
<p>very well-read in literature and culture person</p>
<p>that could be-</p>
<p>He was sort of the next generation&rsquo;s Tim Leary,</p>
<p>someone who could really speak,</p>
<p>get a little closer to the magnitude</p>
<p>of what the psychedelic experience was like for people.</p>
<p>And he served, like Leary, somewhat of an advocate.</p>
<p>I mean, he would tell people,</p>
<p>folks, you could see the equivalent of a UFO</p>
<p>landing on the White House lawn.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s right there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll take five minutes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll shake everything in your reality.</p>
<p>He would sort of goad people into doing it.</p>
<p>Well, certainly science and clinical medicine</p>
<p>are just but two lenses</p>
<p>with which to explore these things in life.</p>
<p>But part of the reason I ask is,</p>
<p>I feel like in the world of health and fitness,</p>
<p>you have this very extreme condition</p>
<p>of like Arnold Schwarzeneggers and bodybuilders</p>
<p>who have like 2% body fat,</p>
<p>and they look like, to most people,</p>
<p>they look kind of freakish, especially now, right?</p>
<p>Oh, especially now.</p>
<p>Especially now.</p>
<p>And yet-</p>
<p>Arnold looked like regular back in his day, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you have contortionists</p>
<p>who can put themselves into a small box</p>
<p>and wrap themselves into a pretzel.</p>
<p>But from those two very extreme subculture practices</p>
<p>that, I don&rsquo;t know anything about contortionism, really,</p>
<p>except that they get really bendy,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a community that included lifestyle practices</p>
<p>and nutritional practices and in drug practices.</p>
<p>From those very extreme subcultures,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been an export,</p>
<p>which is that weight training is healthy, right?</p>
<p>The general public has done that, or that yoga is healthy.</p>
<p>So contortionism to yoga, et cetera.</p>
<p>And I feel like a similar thing is happening</p>
<p>in the realm of psychedelics,</p>
<p>where it was Leary and Huxley.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m from the Bay Area.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not far from the Menlo Park VA</p>
<p>where One Flew Over the Cuckoos</p>
<p>is basically based on, right?</p>
<p>Ken Kesey and those guys.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been an attempt at creating this movement</p>
<p>toward openness about psychedelics</p>
<p>and their positive effects.</p>
<p>This has happened before.</p>
<p>The difference is that now there are people like you</p>
<p>inside the walls of the university</p>
<p>who are publishing peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>The reason I asked about McKenna was,</p>
<p>it seems like McKenna and his brother</p>
<p>are just two of many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera,</p>
<p>who have no real formal training in biology or psychology.</p>
<p>The other guys who were at universities lost their jobs.</p>
<p>They were actually removed from places like Harvard</p>
<p>and other universities</p>
<p>for their kind of cavalier explorations, right?</p>
<p>And now things are kind of returning.</p>
<p>So in the same way that bodybuilding</p>
<p>led to weight training in every corner gym,</p>
<p>you know, men, women, and children,</p>
<p>and contortionism is one extreme,</p>
<p>but people generally think that yoga</p>
<p>is a pretty healthy practice, right?</p>
<p>These are matter of degrees, right?</p>
<p>And now here you are inside the walls</p>
<p>of a very highly respected university, Johns Hopkins.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on the medical school side of the undergrad.</p>
<p>So in the med school,</p>
<p>which is a serious health institution.</p>
<p>The question is to me,</p>
<p>what are the valuable exports, right?</p>
<p>And where does the extreme lie?</p>
<p>I mean, clearly there&rsquo;s a problem</p>
<p>with tinkering with reality through pharmacology,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a benefit, it sounds like,</p>
<p>to tinkering with reality through pharmacology.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s so striking to me</p>
<p>is the elements of atypical experience,</p>
<p>atypical representation of the self.</p>
<p>So for the average person, right,</p>
<p>or for kids that are hearing this,</p>
<p>kids that are in their teens, right,</p>
<p>what are the, I want to talk about,</p>
<p>what are the dangers of psychedelics?</p>
<p>This is something you don&rsquo;t hear a lot about these days,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not because I&rsquo;m anti-psychedelic at all,</p>
<p>but what are the dangers, right?</p>
<p>If a kid or adult has a predisposition toward,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, psychotic thinking, right,</p>
<p>or auditory hallucinations,</p>
<p>or is on the Asperger&rsquo;s side of the autism spectrum,</p>
<p>is there an increased risk</p>
<p>of bringing the mind into these states?</p>
<p>Because it sounds like a very labile situation.</p>
<p>So could we talk a little bit about that,</p>
<p>and are there classes of these different drugs,</p>
<p>whether or not it be MDMA, LSD, or DMT,</p>
<p>that you think are particularly sharp blades</p>
<p>and therefore need to be wielded particularly carefully?</p>
<p>Yeah, so these can be profoundly destabilizing experiences,</p>
<p>and ones that ideally are had in a safe container,</p>
<p>sort of where someone, what are the relevant dangers,</p>
<p>and what can we do to mitigate those?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two biggies.</p>
<p>One, and I&rsquo;ve already mentioned,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s people with very severe psychiatric illness,</p>
<p>not depression, not anxiety.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about psychotic disorders like schizophrenia</p>
<p>or mania as part of bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>So, and diagnostically, this has shifted,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a little hard to say how many people today</p>
<p>with bipolar would have been labeled as schizophrenia</p>
<p>back in the 60s when some of this early research</p>
<p>or just clinical observation was done.</p>
<p>And so it seems very clear that folks</p>
<p>with a predisposition or active disease,</p>
<p>they could be destabilized.</p>
<p>And so some of the cases that we know of,</p>
<p>I always think of Syd Barrett,</p>
<p>the first singer of Pink Floyd,</p>
<p>seems pretty clear, although I think the family-</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what happened there.</p>
<p>I should be, sorry, Pink Floyd fans, I&rsquo;ve never,</p>
<p>the songs are just really long.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re more of a punk guy, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve got my foot in a lot of worlds,</p>
<p>definitely in part in the Floyd world,</p>
<p>but he basically went crazy early on.</p>
<p>He, it seemed, I don&rsquo;t think his family ever admitted it,</p>
<p>but he developed schizophrenia, classic pattern.</p>
<p>And he was doing a lot of LSD,</p>
<p>but like a lot of these cases,</p>
<p>it looked like he was showing all of the signs of</p>
<p>some hints that he had that susceptibility before.</p>
<p>And often this is hard to disentangle what causes what,</p>
<p>because when do people typically, not always,</p>
<p>but develop, when&rsquo;s the modal period for first break?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s adolescence, early adulthood, yeah.</p>
<p>And when do people start playing with drugs?</p>
<p>Same exact time period.</p>
<p>So it can be hard to disentangle,</p>
<p>but it seems pretty clear.</p>
<p>Now I should also say,</p>
<p>there are cases of folks with schizophrenia</p>
<p>that say psychedelics have helped them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s anecdotes for everything, though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big world.</p>
<p>Do the people around those schizophrenics</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s helped them?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Because when schizophrenics say things, you have to,</p>
<p>I mean, with all due compassion and respect</p>
<p>for schizophrenia, it&rsquo;s a disorder of thinking.</p>
<p>So if they&rsquo;re saying it helped them.</p>
<p>Yeah, can you trust them?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if there was some kernel of truth</p>
<p>in some cases, but there&rsquo;s just so,</p>
<p>it seems very clear that the other side is there too,</p>
<p>and that there ever is a therapeutic potential there</p>
<p>for those disorders,</p>
<p>that that shouldn&rsquo;t be the first thing on our list.</p>
<p>We need to learn a lot more because of the level of risk</p>
<p>before we start doing research to see if psilocybin</p>
<p>can help with schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t think that, that may never be the case,</p>
<p>but even if it is, you&rsquo;d have to be even more cautious</p>
<p>and figure some more things out first</p>
<p>with some of these other disorders.</p>
<p>What about bipolar disorder?</p>
<p>Can it be exacerbated by these?</p>
<p>Yeah, and it may be that sort of the manifestation</p>
<p>of people having prolonged psychiatric issues</p>
<p>after a psychotic experience, as atypical as that is,</p>
<p>when that happens, it may be that that might be</p>
<p>more like a manic episode than a psychotic episode,</p>
<p>and that can be a blurry line.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, the folklore is that people go on a trip</p>
<p>and they never come back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s clearly not the case because the drug is metabolized</p>
<p>like for anyone else, and the next day,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s virtually nothing in their system.</p>
<p>But it would shift circuitry, I mean.</p>
<p>Right, and there&rsquo;s still, and I really do think,</p>
<p>much like the positive long-term effects</p>
<p>that this class of problems is related to the experience</p>
<p>and the destabilization that can happen</p>
<p>from that experience.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not in the right container,</p>
<p>and again, like these people are susceptible to,</p>
<p>you know, some people with that psychotic predisposition,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re lucky to be born to a great family,</p>
<p>stable environment, they maybe never have a full break,</p>
<p>or the one that they have is not nearly as bad as what,</p>
<p>you know, someone who&rsquo;s homeless</p>
<p>and is coming from all kinds of early childhood trauma,</p>
<p>like the disease is probably going to be far worse,</p>
<p>you know, so, you know, having a psychedelic experience</p>
<p>is like one of those destabilizing experiences.</p>
<p>You know, so, now, fortunately,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really easy to identify those people.</p>
<p>And we even err on the side of extreme caution</p>
<p>by eliminating people with, like,</p>
<p>say, a first-degree relative.</p>
<p>In some studies, even a second-degree relative.</p>
<p>Given the heritability, there&rsquo;s some increased chance</p>
<p>if your brother or your, yeah.</p>
<p>So, in an abundance of caution, even eliminating that.</p>
<p>I think, eventually, if it&rsquo;s approved for use,</p>
<p>FDA use, we could dial back on that as we learn more.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, again, overly cautious, which is-</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re dealing with an early-stage clinical trial.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s the appropriate place</p>
<p>to start at this point in time.</p>
<p>But, you know, if you, you know, give a SCID</p>
<p>or another structured psychiatric interview</p>
<p>with a clinician sitting down with this person</p>
<p>for a few hours to delve into their history,</p>
<p>and, like, you can very reliably determine</p>
<p>that this person has either, you know,</p>
<p>a psychotic disorder or bipolar disorder</p>
<p>or a strong predisposition.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s, you know, that, you can screen for that,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how you address that.</p>
<p>The far more likely danger is the bad trip.</p>
<p>Anyone can have this.</p>
<p>The most psychologically healthy person</p>
<p>in the world, probably.</p>
<p>You jack the dose high enough, and especially</p>
<p>in a less than an ideal environment,</p>
<p>you can have a bad trip.</p>
<p>You even get it in an ideal environment like ours,</p>
<p>at a high dose of around 30 milligrams of psilocybin,</p>
<p>after, you know, the best preparation we can provide,</p>
<p>about a third of people will say,</p>
<p>essentially, at some point, they have a bad trip.</p>
<p>You know, and we-</p>
<p>At some point within the entire journey.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Now, they could have one of the most beautiful experiences</p>
<p>of their life, sometimes, like, a couple minutes later,</p>
<p>but at some point, they had a sense of strong anxiety,</p>
<p>fear, losing their mind, feeling trapped,</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>Now, typically, when people have that in the, you know,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re just taking on their own,</p>
<p>like a lot of things, they&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>They get through it.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re more likely to be better off</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re not having to navigate the streets of Manhattan,</p>
<p>that, you know, and if they&rsquo;re with, you know,</p>
<p>other people, with friends, better,</p>
<p>that those friends aren&rsquo;t also dealing</p>
<p>with their own psychedelic experience,</p>
<p>but probably having some friend of any type,</p>
<p>but whatever they&rsquo;re on, there&rsquo;s better than having nothing.</p>
<p>So, very dependent on context.</p>
<p>And so, the tough thing here that,</p>
<p>in conveying to the public, is that a lot of folks will say,</p>
<p>man, I&rsquo;ve taken psychedelics hundreds of times,</p>
<p>and this is like, you&rsquo;re fear-mongering,</p>
<p>and, you know, there&rsquo;s no, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re exaggerating the danger there.</p>
<p>So, I want to say, it is atypical, but sometimes,</p>
<p>I have a file folder that grows larger every year</p>
<p>of these cases, either in the medical literature</p>
<p>or from the news, of people that freak out on a psychedelic,</p>
<p>and they get hurt or they die.</p>
<p>They run into traffic, they fall from a height,</p>
<p>whether they thought they could fly,</p>
<p>or whether they just felt like you can do when you&rsquo;re drunk</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re intoxicated on any substance.</p>
<p>Sometimes that&rsquo;s unclear.</p>
<p>Or, gosh, one of the craziest cases</p>
<p>was a kid, like an 18-year-old or so,</p>
<p>in Oregon several years back that just,</p>
<p>he even wrote about, I want to take the biggest,</p>
<p>he had done mushing before,</p>
<p>I want to take a heroic dose,</p>
<p>the biggest dose I&rsquo;ve ever taken.</p>
<p>He ended up just totally out of it,</p>
<p>ended up in a neighbor&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>He was just totally disoriented, disconnected from reality,</p>
<p>and the cops ended up killing him.</p>
<p>And it was just tragic, obviously an overuse of force</p>
<p>in that case, because he was actually naked at the time,</p>
<p>this naked, like, 120-pound, I think, as I recall, kid</p>
<p>that ended up dying.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s analogous to the, you know,</p>
<p>the reason I use the examples of, like,</p>
<p>bodybuilding culture.</p>
<p>I mean, people there have taken excesses of amounts</p>
<p>of anabolics and diuretics and died.</p>
<p>Then the contortionist culture,</p>
<p>people have put themselves in a little plexiglass boxes</p>
<p>to do, you know, at the extremes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get deaths.</p>
<p>And at the extremes, and one of the extremes</p>
<p>is the sheer number of people</p>
<p>with different biological makeups taking the same drug.</p>
<p>And so you can create extremes through numbers,</p>
<p>you can take extremes, you create extremes</p>
<p>through dosage, right, it seems.</p>
<p>Well, this is why I&rsquo;m such a fan of the fact</p>
<p>that people like yourself are doing clinical trials</p>
<p>inside the walls of universities,</p>
<p>not because I think that psychedelics</p>
<p>only have utility in those environments,</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s so important</p>
<p>toward creating their transition to legality</p>
<p>and to understand what legality means</p>
<p>for a compound like this, right?</p>
<p>What model?</p>
<p>Right, I mean, again,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll stay with the anabolic steroids.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s now testosterone and estrogen replacement therapy.</p>
<p>Hormone replacement therapy</p>
<p>is a common medically approved practice,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s vastly different than people</p>
<p>taking their own stuff or deciding</p>
<p>how much they need to take, right?</p>
<p>Like we said, there&rsquo;s yoga and there&rsquo;s contortionism</p>
<p>in a plexiglass box and, you know,</p>
<p>thinking of Houdini or something.</p>
<p>So these are a matter of degrees.</p>
<p>Speaking of dosage, I definitely want to ask you</p>
<p>about microdose versus standard or macrodose.</p>
<p>Tell me that I&rsquo;m wrong, but I&rsquo;m always a little bit,</p>
<p>I sort of, a little, I&rsquo;m micro-cynical, if you will,</p>
<p>about this term microdose.</p>
<p>And the reason is that many people that I know</p>
<p>who talk about microdosing are taking dosages of compounds</p>
<p>that work at, that are very powerful at microgram levels.</p>
<p>So the word micro, I think,</p>
<p>can be a little bit confusing to people</p>
<p>because microdose implies less than something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mini-dose, right?</p>
<p>And yet some of these compounds are tremendously powerful</p>
<p>at microgram concentrations.</p>
<p>So what constitutes a microdose</p>
<p>and what is the value of so-called microdosing, if any,</p>
<p>and how does it differ from standard</p>
<p>or what I can only assume is called macrodosing?</p>
<p>Yeah, and so LSD would be the prototypical example</p>
<p>of that super potent compound.</p>
<p>What size dosage of LSD will lead to hallucinations</p>
<p>and kind of standard?</p>
<p>So sort of the entry point for psychedelic type effects,</p>
<p>which may not involve hallucination,</p>
<p>actually, most classic psychedelics</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t lead to true hallucinations</p>
<p>as defined in psychiatry of thinking you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>to the person that&rsquo;s not there, seeing the pink elephant.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s more like tracers and things like that.</p>
<p>Right, and yet some people never get that</p>
<p>even at a very high dose.</p>
<p>So I think more broadly in terms of the psychedelic effects,</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t just perceptual,</p>
<p>unless we get into the level of,</p>
<p>as you were alluding to earlier,</p>
<p>a broader definition of perception,</p>
<p>like one&rsquo;s models of the world, the model of the self,</p>
<p>you can consider all of that perception</p>
<p>in terms of truly not sensation,</p>
<p>but the perception, the construction</p>
<p>of putting together reality.</p>
<p>So yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So the psychedelic effects are typically considered</p>
<p>to start for LSD around 100 micrograms.</p>
<p>So a 10th of a milligram is 100 micrograms.</p>
<p>Right, so someone taking 100 micrograms of LSD,</p>
<p>nowadays people might mistakenly refer to that</p>
<p>as a microdose because it&rsquo;s micrograms,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s actually a macrodose of LSD.</p>
<p>Right, and that&rsquo;s one of the most common mistakes</p>
<p>or situations that people get into with microdosing</p>
<p>is they intend it to be a microdose,</p>
<p>but it ends up being a full-blown dose.</p>
<p>Now, people do, when they&rsquo;re working with LSD</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re microdosing,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll shoot for something like, say, 10 milligrams,</p>
<p>something in that range, 10, 20 milligrams of LSD.</p>
<p>So, you know, a 10th, a 5th, something of kind</p>
<p>of your entry-level psychedelic dose.</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s ability on the street to do this,</p>
<p>you know, I say the street as if they&rsquo;re on the corner,</p>
<p>but anyway, like outside of the medical profession</p>
<p>to do this, like, it varies as you can-</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not measuring purity or molarity</p>
<p>or things like that, typically.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s ways to do it.</p>
<p>So even if you don&rsquo;t ultimately know the dose</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in like the blotter paper of acid,</p>
<p>one could at least get a sense of like, yeah,</p>
<p>having one of those tabs is, one of those hits</p>
<p>is a psychedelic experience.</p>
<p>They could do something like put it in water,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 100% aqueous, soluble.</p>
<p>You could, you know, make sure it all gets into solution</p>
<p>and then volumetrically measure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be homogeneously distributed.</p>
<p>So you can take one 10th of that volume of water</p>
<p>after it&rsquo;s fully dissolved.</p>
<p>You know, that whatever you started with,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have a 10th of that dose.</p>
<p>So the people that are more sophisticated</p>
<p>will do things like that.</p>
<p>And when they&rsquo;re working with mushrooms,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll grow a bunch of mushrooms</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll, say, put it in a coffee grinder.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not telling people to do this, by the way,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just describing, so don&rsquo;t do this at home,</p>
<p>but like grind it all up so it&rsquo;s homogenous.</p>
<p>Because you can have like, you know,</p>
<p>sort of taking, you know, two caps in a stem.</p>
<p>Hey, this two caps in the stem that this buddy takes</p>
<p>has a different potency than this two caps in the stem</p>
<p>that the other buddy takes.</p>
<p>So people that are kind of in the know</p>
<p>will grind it all up into a homogenous powder</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll pack it into whatever size capsule.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll know that, and again,</p>
<p>even if they don&rsquo;t have, sometimes they might have a buddy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll sneak it into the HPLC at their job or whatever,</p>
<p>if they have-</p>
<p>Not your lab.</p>
<p>Not my lab, that&rsquo;s never happened.</p>
<p>Yeah, seriously, never happened.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ll at least know that,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;ve got a sense of what two capsules do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a sense of what five capsules do.</p>
<p>But in reality, like that&rsquo;s not what people do.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll take a piece of blotter paper</p>
<p>and they get a tiny little pair of scissors,</p>
<p>a Swiss Army knife pair of scissors,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll cut up the tab of acid,</p>
<p>which is like a quarter inch square or something,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll cut it up in 10 little pieces.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you have no idea</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s equally distributed in that media.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we can chuckle about it.</p>
<p>But to me, one of the reasons</p>
<p>why this experiment around psychedelics,</p>
<p>this cultural experiment and this legal experiment,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing this now,</p>
<p>but this was all attempted once before</p>
<p>in the 60s and 70s.</p>
<p>The difference was it was all out in the street.</p>
<p>The people in universities</p>
<p>who were dabbling with this stuff,</p>
<p>most of them lost their jobs</p>
<p>or were asked to leave through, you know.</p>
<p>They lost their funding for this research minimally</p>
<p>and they had to move on to other topics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So these are precarious times.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re at a key moment</p>
<p>where everyone assumes</p>
<p>that this is all going to be legal in a few years.</p>
<p>But I think that that&rsquo;s a premature assumption, frankly.</p>
<p>But, and let&rsquo;s touch on the legality</p>
<p>and some of the things that are happening now,</p>
<p>but what is microdosing psilocybin</p>
<p>versus the sorts of dosages that you described before</p>
<p>in the 10 to 40 milligram range?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard of people taking one or two milligrams</p>
<p>of psilocybin every day as a way to quote, unquote,</p>
<p>and for those listening,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just making air quotes with my fingers,</p>
<p>increase plasticity,</p>
<p>which is a term that I personally loathe</p>
<p>because what does that mean?</p>
<p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t really want your brain to be plastic</p>
<p>because you need to make,</p>
<p>you need to maintain your ability to make predictions.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean-</p>
<p>Order and chaos, like prediction.</p>
<p>You need models of the world.</p>
<p>You need heuristics, like-</p>
<p>Plasticity is never the goal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll repeat it, plasticity is never the goal.</p>
<p>The end goal.</p>
<p>Goal-directed plasticity is the goal, right?</p>
<p>Learning a language,</p>
<p>reshaping your experience to a trauma,</p>
<p>altering the perception of self,</p>
<p>but plasticity is a process, like-</p>
<p>Yeah, schizophrenia is a lot of plasticity.</p>
<p>Exactly, right, and it might even be,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one theory that it&rsquo;s extreme ongoing plasticity,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why people never create</p>
<p>stable representations of anything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a kind of a minority view out there,</p>
<p>but so what&rsquo;s the business with microdosing,</p>
<p>and is there any clinical evidence</p>
<p>or peer-reviewed published evidence</p>
<p>that it works, quote, unquote,</p>
<p>to make people feel better about anything?</p>
<p>So microdosing is the aim of taking,</p>
<p>again, something around a tenth</p>
<p>of what would be sort of an entry-level psychedelic dose</p>
<p>for whatever compound, so like, yeah, with psilocybin,</p>
<p>usually people, almost never do people</p>
<p>have like pure psilocybin,</p>
<p>like one milligram of psilocybin</p>
<p>would be in the range of a microdose.</p>
<p>More likely, people are going to have mushrooms,</p>
<p>like something like a half of a gram of mushroom.</p>
<p>I know people that are doing this every day.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing this every day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like in their, like the same way that I take,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m personally, I&rsquo;m not recommending</p>
<p>other people do this, but I take some,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of LCL carnitine lately.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been kind of experimenting with that a little bit,</p>
<p>which is not a psychedelic compound,</p>
<p>but I take it every day,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re taking their psilocybin every day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s their supplement, so.</p>
<p>So yeah, the claims are, and there are a number of them,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two general ones.</p>
<p>One is sort of acting in place of the ADHD-treating drugs,</p>
<p>so the psychomotor stimulants,</p>
<p>so like a better version of Adderall.</p>
<p>The other claims are essentially a better version</p>
<p>of the traditional antidepressants,</p>
<p>a better version of Prozac.</p>
<p>So people are taking them both for attention deficit</p>
<p>and for depression.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the aspects of those disorders</p>
<p>is that we all have a degree of,</p>
<p>just like amphetamine is going to increase the focus</p>
<p>at the right dose of anyone who takes amphetamine,</p>
<p>pretty much, whether you&rsquo;re ADHD-diagnosed or not,</p>
<p>the idea is that there may not be necessarily a clear divide</p>
<p>between the therapeutic need and positive psychology,</p>
<p>even improving mood and focus,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not necessarily correcting ADHD,</p>
<p>but improving focus to supercharge your life.</p>
<p>And so those are the claims.</p>
<p>So none of the peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>that have much credibility,</p>
<p>none of them have shown a benefit, and they&rsquo;ve tried.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s only at this point four or five studies that,</p>
<p>and I think for things like this,</p>
<p>you really need double-blind research,</p>
<p>because the effects, I mean,</p>
<p>there was one study done in Amsterdam</p>
<p>where people knew they were taking psilocybin truffles,</p>
<p>basically same as mushrooms,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re more like the roots of the mycelia.</p>
<p>Microdosing, though.</p>
<p>Well, taking what would be considered a microdose</p>
<p>and then doing some cognitive measures before and after,</p>
<p>and the types of things that,</p>
<p>like a lot of cognitive measures,</p>
<p>are measured on the order of reaction time in milliseconds.</p>
<p>I mean, and the types of effects you get</p>
<p>as you could imagine are ones that would be,</p>
<p>you would totally expect could be there</p>
<p>from either a practice effect</p>
<p>or an expectancy effect, a placebo effect.</p>
<p>So for something like these claimed,</p>
<p>you could imagine a sort of an increased focus,</p>
<p>an enhancement of cognition.</p>
<p>These are going to be more subtle effects</p>
<p>that you really need a good placebo control for.</p>
<p>The handful of studies that have done that have shown,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve ranged from finding no effect whatsoever</p>
<p>to just a little bit of impairment,</p>
<p>like impairing someone&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to do time estimation and production tasks.</p>
<p>So you want an accurate sense of time,</p>
<p>at least if you&rsquo;re navigating in the real world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different if you&rsquo;re on the couch on a heroic dose</p>
<p>for therapeutic reasons where you&rsquo;re safe,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re crossing the street,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re, you know, in your work life,</p>
<p>which is the way people are claiming to use</p>
<p>that it helps them be a better CEO.</p>
<p>Like you want an accurate sense of time.</p>
<p>So if anything, the data suggests</p>
<p>that it makes it a little bit less accurate.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s evidence that someone feels</p>
<p>a little bit impaired and they feel a little bit high.</p>
<p>So in terms of, you know,</p>
<p>you call that abuse liability in research, not surprising.</p>
<p>You take a little bit of a drug</p>
<p>that can result in some type of a high</p>
<p>and you take a little tiny bit of it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll feel a little bit high.</p>
<p>So, you know, none of the,</p>
<p>so far no studies have shown, you know,</p>
<p>an increase in creativity,</p>
<p>enhancement of any form of cognition</p>
<p>or a sustained improvement in mood.</p>
<p>Now, no studies have actually looked at</p>
<p>the system of microdosing</p>
<p>that the aficionados are claiming.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a couple of models out there,</p>
<p>but folks like Paul Stamets and others,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll have particular formulas.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, you need to take it one day</p>
<p>and then take so many days off and take it every four days.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to get into whose model is what,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s always something like that.</p>
<p>Some pattern of use, usually not every day.</p>
<p>And the claim is that it&rsquo;s not just, you know,</p>
<p>sometimes people get benefit that first time</p>
<p>when they take it,</p>
<p>but they really say you need to be on it for a while.</p>
<p>Like a few weeks in, you may start to notice</p>
<p>through this pattern of using it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re feeling the benefits on those off days,</p>
<p>like the three or two days in between your active doses.</p>
<p>So those are the claims.</p>
<p>Again, we don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s any truth to that working,</p>
<p>but studies have not been done to model that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a big caveat.</p>
<p>We as a field, I say we as the scientific field,</p>
<p>have not done the studies to really model, you know,</p>
<p>what the real aficionados are claiming, you know,</p>
<p>where the therapeutic benefits come from.</p>
<p>That said, it&rsquo;s almost assuredly</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a good amount of placebo there.</p>
<p>But the caveat to that is like almost everything</p>
<p>in medicine or therapeutics,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s going to have some degree of placebo there.</p>
<p>Belief effects are, I have a colleague at Stanford,</p>
<p>Aaliyah Crumb, who has published really beautiful work</p>
<p>on belief effects that show that essentially</p>
<p>you give the same milkshake to two people,</p>
<p>you, or two groups of people,</p>
<p>you tell them that one contains a lot of nutrients,</p>
<p>the other is a low calorie shake.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re, the insulin response.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Varies dramatically between the two,</p>
<p>or two groups rather doing equivalent amounts</p>
<p>of physical movement.</p>
<p>And you tell one group that it&rsquo;s going to be good for them</p>
<p>and help them lose weight.</p>
<p>And they lose on average eight to 12 pounds more</p>
<p>doing the exact same patterns of movement.</p>
<p>So, and I think that these belief effects boil down</p>
<p>to all sorts of kind of network-wide neuromodulation,</p>
<p>things of that sort.</p>
<p>And then the work at Harvard suggesting</p>
<p>that even if you don&rsquo;t have deception,</p>
<p>you give a placebo and say, this is a sugar pill.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You know, and tell them that.</p>
<p>And they could still treat things.</p>
<p>I think irritable bowel was the first thing they looked at.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a huge, so there&rsquo;s a reality there.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a necessity in developing drugs</p>
<p>to make sure it&rsquo;s not only that,</p>
<p>but in the actual practice of medicine,</p>
<p>hopefully what you&rsquo;re always getting</p>
<p>is some underlying direct efficacy</p>
<p>plus the placebo that enhances that.</p>
<p>Now, it could be that this is,</p>
<p>the real question is, is the microdosing,</p>
<p>are those claims 100% placebo,</p>
<p>or are they only part placebo and part real,</p>
<p>you know, quote unquote effect?</p>
<p>My bet is, and this is totally based on anecdotes,</p>
<p>that I think there is probably a reality</p>
<p>to the antidepressant effects.</p>
<p>I find that more intriguing</p>
<p>because of the suffering with depression.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be as interesting</p>
<p>as I think what we&rsquo;re doing with high-dose psilocybin</p>
<p>or psychedelics to treat depression.</p>
<p>It would be, if this is developed and there&rsquo;s a reality,</p>
<p>it would be more like a better,</p>
<p>perhaps a better SSRI, a better Prozac.</p>
<p>Which are similar.</p>
<p>That being said, we need more tools</p>
<p>than fewer tools in the toolbox.</p>
<p>And it shouldn&rsquo;t be that surprise.</p>
<p>Like even before, going back to the tricyclics</p>
<p>and the MAO inhibitors going back to the 50s,</p>
<p>augmenting extracellular serotonin in one way or another</p>
<p>for many people leads to a reduction in depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be that crazy</p>
<p>for chronically stimulating a subtype of serotonin receptor</p>
<p>that you have an antidepressant effect.</p>
<p>So I think if I had put my bets on it,</p>
<p>that if there&rsquo;s anything real, it is in that category.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m very open to like,</p>
<p>maybe there is something to the creativity,</p>
<p>to the improved cognition,</p>
<p>which covers many domains in and of itself.</p>
<p>But my greatest hopes are on the antidepressant effects.</p>
<p>That said, in the big picture,</p>
<p>I think all of the most interesting thing</p>
<p>about psychedelics are the heroic doses.</p>
<p>I mean, the idea that you can give something</p>
<p>one, two, three times</p>
<p>and you see improvements in depression months later</p>
<p>and in addiction over a year later.</p>
<p>And with these people dealing</p>
<p>with potentially terminal illness.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m interested in big effects</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re ever going</p>
<p>to get the really big effects.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also some concern</p>
<p>that almost all of these common,</p>
<p>the more common psychedelics, even counting MDMA,</p>
<p>they have serotonin 2B agonist effects.</p>
<p>And agonizing serotonin 2B has been shown</p>
<p>to lead to heart valve formation problems,</p>
<p>morphology issues.</p>
<p>So, valvulopathy.</p>
<p>And so this is why Fen-Phen was pulled from the market.</p>
<p>The diadrug.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Very effective diadrug.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>And it was the portion of that combination</p>
<p>that had the serotonin 2B activity that was the problem.</p>
<p>And so we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So all of the toxicologists I&rsquo;ve ever spoken to about this</p>
<p>would say, and cardiologists say like,</p>
<p>look, hey, if there was some concern there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not applicable to the whole idea</p>
<p>of you taking something a few times therapeutically</p>
<p>within a lifetime.</p>
<p>But the idea of taking something like twice a week for years,</p>
<p>I mean, even the hippies back in the 60s</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t doing that, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s not even these natural,</p>
<p>and even if there was some heart valve disease problem</p>
<p>that stemmed from psychedelic use,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s connecting those dots?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not showing up in the clinical charts.</p>
<p>So there is, and just theoretically,</p>
<p>there is more of a concern.</p>
<p>If something&rsquo;s going to happen with heart valves,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more likely that those issues would arise</p>
<p>when someone&rsquo;s taking these things,</p>
<p>like yeah, let&rsquo;s take twice a week for the next five years.</p>
<p>And so I do want to throw that out to people</p>
<p>to really consider.</p>
<p>Right, yeah, it&rsquo;s something I hadn&rsquo;t heard before</p>
<p>that in micro sounds safer,</p>
<p>micro dosing as opposed to heroic or macro dosing.</p>
<p>And yet, unless, and in the context of your lab</p>
<p>and other labs doing similar work,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got this people checking blood pressure,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got people that are really monitoring</p>
<p>your psychological and physical safety.</p>
<p>When people are out there micro dosing,</p>
<p>it sounds like there&rsquo;s a potential</p>
<p>either through this serotonin 5H2B receptor</p>
<p>or other mechanism that maybe there could be</p>
<p>some kind of cumulative negative effects.</p>
<p>They, and I think that&rsquo;s a really important consideration.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m glad you brought it up.</p>
<p>What about kids?</p>
<p>So the brain is very plastic early in life.</p>
<p>It becomes less plastic as we age,</p>
<p>although it maintains some degree of plasticity</p>
<p>throughout the lifespan.</p>
<p>The year 25, not the year 25, but rather the age 25 years</p>
<p>is sort of an inflection point where the rigidity</p>
<p>of the neuro system seems to really take off.</p>
<p>Of course, people don&rsquo;t wake up on their 25th birthday</p>
<p>and find they have no neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>whereas the day before they had a lot.</p>
<p>These are, it&rsquo;s plus or minus, whatever it is,</p>
<p>a year or two, but depends on the individual.</p>
<p>However, the young brain is very plastic.</p>
<p>And I could imagine there could be great risks.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe even benefits,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m certainly not thinking about those.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m mainly thinking about the risks</p>
<p>for young people taking psychedelics.</p>
<p>Are there any trials looking at people in clinical trials?</p>
<p>This would be under the age of 18.</p>
<p>Has anyone explored this in a rigorous way?</p>
<p>Given the potential to exacerbate psychotic symptoms</p>
<p>and bipolar symptoms in some people,</p>
<p>is there heightened risk of that?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the story with age of use in psychedelics</p>
<p>for therapeutic purposes?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no formal research,</p>
<p>although there&rsquo;s a very high chance that there will be.</p>
<p>And so this is one of the very interesting things</p>
<p>folks may not realize or appreciate</p>
<p>about the FDA approval process.</p>
<p>So the FDA already in multiple instances has signaled</p>
<p>that they want to see those studies.</p>
<p>Before?</p>
<p>Well, not before it&rsquo;s approved as necessarily</p>
<p>as for adults, but they&rsquo;re going to eventually want to see.</p>
<p>In fact, so the MAPS group that&rsquo;s developing MDMA for PTSD,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve already signaled</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s kind of on the list of interest.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s even some incentives in the FDA pathways</p>
<p>for incentivizing folks to explore that use in young people.</p>
<p>I know in some of the work that I helped with</p>
<p>in pushing psilocybin into phase 2B clinical trials,</p>
<p>the FDA said, well, why can&rsquo;t you give this to kids?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, are you aware that depression</p>
<p>is a problem with adolescents?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>because this FDA is very concerned about pseudospecificity.</p>
<p>The idea that you put out a drug and say,</p>
<p>oh, this is good for men, but not women.</p>
<p>This is good for black folks, but not white folks.</p>
<p>And now sometimes there&rsquo;s a very good rationale</p>
<p>for that, like when we&rsquo;re talking about hormones</p>
<p>and for a specific, for men versus women.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s certain issues,</p>
<p>certain disease, say it&rsquo;s like maybe sickle cell anemia,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more relevant.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>But absent of something that,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very concerned about saying,</p>
<p>oh, this is for this type of person,</p>
<p>but not that type of person.</p>
<p>So age is one of those things.</p>
<p>And also this recognition,</p>
<p>much like the emphasis at NIH</p>
<p>with rodent studies and human studies,</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t just say you&rsquo;re studying men</p>
<p>or you need a rationale if you&rsquo;re only focused.</p>
<p>Yeah, to be clear to people, it&rsquo;s a recent switch,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a stipulation in every federally funded grant</p>
<p>that both sexes, we don&rsquo;t refer to gender</p>
<p>in scientific studies unless it&rsquo;s a study of gender per se.</p>
<p>We refer to sex, meaning biological sex,</p>
<p>so that there&rsquo;s a stipulation</p>
<p>that in order to receive and continue to receive funding,</p>
<p>you have to do studies on both males and females</p>
<p>of that species, including humans.</p>
<p>And at least, even if you&rsquo;re not powered for it,</p>
<p>at least looking at that in exploratory analysis,</p>
<p>like as a grant reviewer, I&rsquo;m charged with looking at,</p>
<p>did they address sex</p>
<p>as a biologically relevant variable?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You just throw it in there.</p>
<p>Does the same drug have different effects</p>
<p>in males versus females?</p>
<p>Right, and you could at least look at the trends,</p>
<p>even again, if you&rsquo;re underpowered,</p>
<p>to look at those between subject type effects.</p>
<p>Which is a great shift that didn&rsquo;t exist in 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Sounds like we&rsquo;re both on grants panels.</p>
<p>As study section members, you didn&rsquo;t have to do that.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s an important biological variable.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t look at that,</p>
<p>you essentially won&rsquo;t get your funding.</p>
<p>And age is a similar thing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the whole idea like, man,</p>
<p>if something could help kids, what&rsquo;s the rationale?</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s going to be,</p>
<p>now, obviously, you&rsquo;re going to have in those studies</p>
<p>at least just as much, probably more,</p>
<p>it should be more, you know, of a cautionary approach.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably going to be, you know,</p>
<p>would certainly whatever disease states are looked at</p>
<p>are going to have to be probably treatment resistant,</p>
<p>at least as a first step.</p>
<p>You know, hey, the kids tried-</p>
<p>Suicidal depression.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, and so all of that in the mix.</p>
<p>But hey, you know, if this stuff really helps people,</p>
<p>you know, that are 25 or 30,</p>
<p>like, what&rsquo;s the rationale</p>
<p>that it won&rsquo;t help a younger person?</p>
<p>You know, and there&rsquo;s these generic kind of concerns</p>
<p>about the developing nervous system</p>
<p>is more susceptible to problem.</p>
<p>I mean, it cuts both ways</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s also more plastic generally</p>
<p>and adaptable, maybe resilient to injury in certain ways.</p>
<p>But, you know, you hear the rhetoric about kids,</p>
<p>their brains and drugs,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like the developing brain is a special concern.</p>
<p>So yeah, but I think we&rsquo;re going to be seeing</p>
<p>research eventually.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I went to the high school.</p>
<p>That is infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,</p>
<p>for having the highest degree,</p>
<p>at least at one point, of suicide,</p>
<p>high suicide rate.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And a very large number of suicides.</p>
<p>This was written up in the Times and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Is it a very academically successful school?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very academically-</p>
<p>So is there a lot of high pressure?</p>
<p>Yeah, very academically demanding school</p>
<p>to the point where they&rsquo;ve restricted.</p>
<p>The kids will meet often at 6.30 a.m.</p>
<p>or 6 a.m. before school for study groups</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>So some of it may relate to that.</p>
<p>But I have to say that even prior</p>
<p>to all that academic pressure,</p>
<p>when I went there, the pressure wasn&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>We had an unusual number of suicides for whatever reason.</p>
<p>And so the idea of kids being prescribed,</p>
<p>and I want to emphasize prescribed,</p>
<p>not just using, but prescribed psychedelics</p>
<p>for therapeutic purposes,</p>
<p>I think might make some people balk.</p>
<p>But the idea of kids killing themselves</p>
<p>should also make people balk.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m relieved to hear that there&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>a rational, scientific, safe,</p>
<p>clinical trial-based exploration of this.</p>
<p>I want to ask you about the current status</p>
<p>of these drugs and compounds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty active on social media,</p>
<p>more so on Instagram than on Twitter.</p>
<p>But as I have been on Twitter a little bit more recently,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that there&rsquo;s a lot of dialogue</p>
<p>around your account and other people&rsquo;s accounts</p>
<p>around a couple of themes related to psychedelics.</p>
<p>First of all, what is the status of the transition</p>
<p>to legality for prescription purposes?</p>
<p>So medical doctors, MDs prescribing it legally</p>
<p>for therapeutic purposes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first question.</p>
<p>The second question is what is the status</p>
<p>as it relates to possession and criminal charges?</p>
<p>So for a long time, I lived in Oakland</p>
<p>where we were one day told not too long ago,</p>
<p>it is now, quote unquote, decriminalized</p>
<p>is what I was told.</p>
<p>Double check, people.</p>
<p>But what does that mean?</p>
<p>And then the other issue, and the third question,</p>
<p>and we can parse these one by one,</p>
<p>is this issue of, let&rsquo;s just say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware of a lot of investor dollars</p>
<p>going into companies that are essentially</p>
<p>companies focused on psychedelics as therapeutics</p>
<p>or psychedelics generally.</p>
<p>I have to assume that they are investing</p>
<p>in anticipation of a shift in the legal status.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of interest now,</p>
<p>like will psilocybin become a taxable thing</p>
<p>just like marijuana?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with the question of like,</p>
<p>what is going on in the US legally?</p>
<p>Is it illegal to possess and sell and use these compounds?</p>
<p>My understanding is you can still go to jail</p>
<p>for having these compounds in your possession</p>
<p>or for selling.</p>
<p>Right, so even though the legal landscape</p>
<p>is very different than with cannabis,</p>
<p>there are some similarities.</p>
<p>So one of the similarities is that regardless</p>
<p>of what local, municipal,</p>
<p>what city or state has decriminalized,</p>
<p>and that word itself can mean many things.</p>
<p>So the devil, some forms of decriminalization</p>
<p>is close to what folks would call legalization</p>
<p>and others are like pretty weak,</p>
<p>just saying we suggest that the police</p>
<p>make it their lowest law enforcement priority,</p>
<p>that type of thing.</p>
<p>Turn the other cheek kind of thing.</p>
<p>Right, but even the cops can still choose to.</p>
<p>But someone could get pulled over for one thing,</p>
<p>searched, and then by definition,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s illegal and they find it,</p>
<p>then they have to do something about it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;ll probably be determined</p>
<p>by both judicial precedent,</p>
<p>is it going to be thrown out?</p>
<p>And just the local prosecutor,</p>
<p>are they going to choose,</p>
<p>even at post-arrest, are they going to pursue</p>
<p>to really go after those charges,</p>
<p>make those charges stick?</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s still in play</p>
<p>and is going to depend on the municipality.</p>
<p>But like cannabis,</p>
<p>federally, these are all Schedule I compounds.</p>
<p>Which means they&rsquo;re illegal.</p>
<p>Which means they&rsquo;re illegal.</p>
<p>The caveat to that,</p>
<p>just as has always been the case</p>
<p>since Prop 215 in California with cannabis in 96,</p>
<p>is that, hey, 99% of drug enforcement</p>
<p>is done at the local and state level.</p>
<p>The DEA, which is the federal level of law enforcement,</p>
<p>is a tiny fraction of the arrests.</p>
<p>I mean, most people that are arrested for any drug</p>
<p>are done by local or state level authorities.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still technically illegal.</p>
<p>And so you can, and they could potentially,</p>
<p>depending on the ambiguity of the local law,</p>
<p>even those local officials could charge you</p>
<p>with a federal crime.</p>
<p>And theoretically, the feds could always come in.</p>
<p>Now, although, again, a similar case</p>
<p>with the whole cannabis history,</p>
<p>it was the feds came in in the early days</p>
<p>with the folks that were basically highly visible.</p>
<p>They went after Tommy Chong for selling bongs.</p>
<p>But I remember him being on the Tonight Show one time,</p>
<p>and I think it was back in the Jay Leno days.</p>
<p>He says, but all along Santa Monica boardwalk,</p>
<p>like every shop sells bongs.</p>
<p>How did you go to prison for a half year for bongs?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because he was-</p>
<p>Because he was famous.</p>
<p>Because he was Tommy Chong.</p>
<p>And there was some high profile cannabis groups</p>
<p>that were distributing it, and they were very vocal.</p>
<p>Those were the ones raided by the DEA in the early days,</p>
<p>not the ones kind of keeping to themselves,</p>
<p>keeping it quiet and just doing their thing.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s always the potential for selective enforcement.</p>
<p>And so in this initiative in Oregon,</p>
<p>which is a state level legalization of psilocybin therapy,</p>
<p>which is really interesting,</p>
<p>part of their plan for two years</p>
<p>is to figure out how to integrate with the federal level.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how that&rsquo;s going to go</p>
<p>because unless you rewrite the Controlled Substances Act,</p>
<p>it seems like the best you&rsquo;re going to get</p>
<p>is a tolerance from the federal government.</p>
<p>And that could be very, hey, you change administrations.</p>
<p>And this is psilocybin by prescription</p>
<p>from a medical doctor,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re talking about therapists</p>
<p>who have master&rsquo;s degrees or PhDs</p>
<p>or self-appointed coaches or something like that,</p>
<p>administering psilocybin, but without any oversight.</p>
<p>So this is all getting figured out in the Oregon case.</p>
<p>And again, there&rsquo;s that two year period</p>
<p>of basically we&rsquo;re going to figure this out.</p>
<p>And so-</p>
<p>What is it with Oregon?</p>
<p>There is a lot of euthanasia.</p>
<p>I love the state of Oregon.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting how you have these pockets.</p>
<p>Oregon, Vermont seems to be one.</p>
<p>You got these kind of pockets</p>
<p>where people are experimental with plant compounds.</p>
<p>They seem to be green woodsy areas, at least in my mind.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s sort of a culture around plants</p>
<p>and the use of plants as therapeutics.</p>
<p>And combine that with the West,</p>
<p>just more geographically of more of the anti-federalism,</p>
<p>the anti, I mean, the Oregon ranchers from several years ago</p>
<p>that held up the whatever wildlife place,</p>
<p>and that was a big showdown with the feds,</p>
<p>and just kind of the West is kind of known</p>
<p>for more of those issues.</p>
<p>So you combine the two,</p>
<p>the hippie-dippie California, Oregon vibe</p>
<p>with the kind of anti&ndash;.</p>
<p>Although I would argue it&rsquo;s becoming less hippie-dippie</p>
<p>than although it was.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always been a tradition,</p>
<p>not just in the culture around drugs,</p>
<p>but certainly in academia and in tech, et cetera,</p>
<p>that the West has been a place</p>
<p>where people have tried to throw off traditionalism</p>
<p>and kind of lineage and like who your parents are,</p>
<p>what school you went to and the past</p>
<p>as a determinant of what&rsquo;s next</p>
<p>and exciting about the future.</p>
<p>Whereas, and here we are an East Coast institution guy</p>
<p>and a West Coast institution guy,</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s this idea of kind of innovation</p>
<p>and the future versus do we stay grounded</p>
<p>in history and tradition?</p>
<p>And of course there are great institutions on both sides.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is that Hopkins,</p>
<p>Johns Hopkins Medical School,</p>
<p>I think of as a real like East Coast academic institution.</p>
<p>It is on the East Coast,</p>
<p>but here you are doing these very pioneering</p>
<p>and important and exploratory studies</p>
<p>in a certainly not a hippie-dippie environment.</p>
<p>Right, oh yeah.</p>
<p>Very conservative psychiatry department,</p>
<p>even amongst psychiatry departments.</p>
<p>And as a psychologist in the psychiatry department,</p>
<p>psychiatry is certainly more conservative than psychology,</p>
<p>even within academics.</p>
<p>But even amongst psychiatry departments,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very conservative department.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got the law at the federal level.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got the law at the state and local level.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ve got this question</p>
<p>of whether or not it&rsquo;s going to be physicians,</p>
<p>so MDs, people with PhDs or master&rsquo;s degrees,</p>
<p>or whether or not it will be kind of a free-for-all</p>
<p>for consumption.</p>
<p>The life coaches.</p>
<p>The life coaches and the general public.</p>
<p>I mean, cannabis, I&rsquo;m not a pot smoker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never appealed to me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just me and my pharmacology.</p>
<p>But you can buy cannabis most places in the US</p>
<p>without a ton of risk, it seems, right?</p>
<p>Are we going to see a time in which</p>
<p>you can essentially go into a shop</p>
<p>on Abbot Kinney Boulevard in Venice, California,</p>
<p>and right now you can go buy marijuana</p>
<p>if you have a marijuana card, it&rsquo;s my understanding.</p>
<p>I see a lot of people going in and out of these stores.</p>
<p>The police certainly have no problem with it.</p>
<p>Is there going to come a time</p>
<p>where people are going to just go buy psilocybin?</p>
<p>Do you think-</p>
<p>Like they do in Amsterdam</p>
<p>and have for a long time.</p>
<p>Do you think that time is coming?</p>
<p>I think so at a certain point,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know how long.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine our current level</p>
<p>of drug criminalization holding up for,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m thinking like large spans of time,</p>
<p>like really in a hundred years</p>
<p>are we going to be doing this?</p>
<p>500 years, like how could that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to be sustainable.</p>
<p>But in five years, for instance.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think so in the United States.</p>
<p>I do think eventually you&rsquo;re going to see</p>
<p>something like that because there&rsquo;s going to be no way.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re going to,</p>
<p>I hope that we&rsquo;re going to eventually come so strongly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to move on from this model</p>
<p>of criminalizing drugs,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re really going to focus on regulating drugs</p>
<p>at the right level for that drug.</p>
<p>And I like the word regulation better than legalization.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I could imagine what one day regulation,</p>
<p>smart regulation might mean for psychedelics.</p>
<p>Maybe it could mean that there will be,</p>
<p>whether or not you have a diagnosis of a problem,</p>
<p>it may be that even for personal exploration,</p>
<p>you can do this legally,</p>
<p>but you first have to maybe take a court,</p>
<p>and this has been, I&rsquo;m not the first to say this,</p>
<p>but get equivalent of a driver&rsquo;s license.</p>
<p>You have to go to get some sort of training.</p>
<p>Maybe your first number of experiences need to be</p>
<p>with trained guides who can facilitate it.</p>
<p>And then the public health information</p>
<p>for anyone using this, that this is what riskier use is.</p>
<p>All use is going to have risk.</p>
<p>This is what riskier use is.</p>
<p>This is less risky use.</p>
<p>These are the factors.</p>
<p>So I think eventually we&rsquo;re going to be getting,</p>
<p>but I would say the same thing for like methamphetamine</p>
<p>and heroin and cocaine, like all of these drugs,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to imagine the current approach</p>
<p>of just feeding a black market</p>
<p>and really exacerbating a lot of the harms from drugs.</p>
<p>That happens under the current model.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine that maintaining.</p>
<p>That isn&rsquo;t to say, I think it should be</p>
<p>in all of the 7-Elevens sold to kids at the other extreme.</p>
<p>I would hope not.</p>
<p>But I do think it&rsquo;s probably not going to be soon</p>
<p>in the United States.</p>
<p>I do want to make the major point</p>
<p>that even if psychedelics had never been made illegal,</p>
<p>I think the exact, the trajectory</p>
<p>of the medical research right now would still need to happen.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s effective as an antidepressant,</p>
<p>like we need it to be, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all the evidence suggesting</p>
<p>that whatever disorder we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>the efficacy is going to be increased</p>
<p>and the risks are going to be mitigated drastically</p>
<p>in the types of models we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>with the screening, with the preparation,</p>
<p>with the integration of cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p>or what have you, depending on the disorder you&rsquo;re treating,</p>
<p>with the integration afterwards, with the professionals.</p>
<p>So we would be doing it anyway.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like this versus that.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t see it as a race between the decriminalization</p>
<p>or legalization of these compounds</p>
<p>versus their medical development.</p>
<p>Some people who are psychedelic fans</p>
<p>get all into a bunch about the medical development.</p>
<p>They say, you guys want to like,</p>
<p>you want to keep it only for, you know,</p>
<p>for your medical research and I retire</p>
<p>and you want to be in control of it as academics.</p>
<p>And my take is I didn&rsquo;t make it illegal for anyone.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re only moving the needle in one direction.</p>
<p>And again, even if it was already illegal,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve done plenty of survey research of people reporting,</p>
<p>they took mushrooms for fun or for personal exploration.</p>
<p>And they said, my God, why am I smoking?</p>
<p>And they quit smoking 20 years because of it,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s helped with their depression,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s helped with them overcoming alcoholism</p>
<p>or these different,</p>
<p>sometimes that happens out of the blue</p>
<p>when people use psychedelics.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, obviously the efficacy rates</p>
<p>are going to be higher when you bring it</p>
<p>into these medical models and it&rsquo;s going to be safer.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to, you know, so we need to be pushing that.</p>
<p>And my best guess is that MDMA is going to be approved</p>
<p>within the next three years.</p>
<p>And for prescription by a physician.</p>
<p>Yes, in, and not just, you know,</p>
<p>take two and call me in the morning,</p>
<p>but in the clinics,</p>
<p>the way that those PTSD trials are being run.</p>
<p>So the MDMA would be approved for PTSD</p>
<p>and every disorder needs to be looked at separately.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to only be approved for those things.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s going to be questions about-</p>
<p>Right, because approved and legalized and regulated,</p>
<p>or, you know, now we&rsquo;re getting into the nuance.</p>
<p>I think when people hear</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be approved in two years,</p>
<p>they think that they&rsquo;ll be able to buy and sell</p>
<p>and use MDMA without legal consequences.</p>
<p>And I do not think that&rsquo;s going to be the situation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the way it is.</p>
<p>And I will say that,</p>
<p>I think the quote unquote psychedelic community,</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;ve been doing what they want to</p>
<p>and will carry on doing what they want to anyway, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like the legal status has prevented them</p>
<p>from doing what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>In fact, unlike Leary and Timothy Leary and Huxley</p>
<p>and, you know, and some of the others that were very vocal</p>
<p>and lost their jobs and some of them even went to jail,</p>
<p>et cetera.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve got a lot of public figures now</p>
<p>like McKenna and others who are just basically out there</p>
<p>talking about psychedelics.</p>
<p>Michael Pollan, who&rsquo;s more of a writer,</p>
<p>foodie guy gone psychedelic dabbler, writer guy.</p>
<p>I know he&rsquo;s kind of a polymath,</p>
<p>but, you know, the legal status didn&rsquo;t seem to hinder</p>
<p>their at least online careers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I haven&rsquo;t looked at their bank accounts,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m imagining they&rsquo;re doing just fine, right?</p>
<p>So the fact that work is happening</p>
<p>inside of big institutions,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important that you point out,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just trying to underscore that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in no way antagonistic to what people are doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in support of a different sort of mission,</p>
<p>which is to explore the validity in different contexts</p>
<p>in a really controlled way, which I really, you know,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a really important mission.</p>
<p>I want to make sure that I ask you</p>
<p>about the other really important mission</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re involved in with respect to psychedelics,</p>
<p>which is not about depression per se,</p>
<p>but is about neurological,</p>
<p>a neurologic injury or head injury.</p>
<p>I realize it&rsquo;s early days for this,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s a lot of concussion out there, sadly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of TBI, traumatic brain injury.</p>
<p>Not just from sports.</p>
<p>I think people sometimes forget that it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>the major source of traumatic head injury is not football.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hockey.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not boxing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not any of that stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s construction workers.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s people, I mean,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve ever seen the helmets</p>
<p>that construction workers wear.</p>
<p>I mean-</p>
<p>The jackhammer.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>The jackhammer.</p>
<p>How could that not be just-</p>
<p>I have a colleague that works on this in bioengineering.</p>
<p>And when you look at the, you know, we always think sports,</p>
<p>but there are many people who make a living</p>
<p>in a way that is over time is detrimental to their brain.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t have the option</p>
<p>of just not being a professional athlete</p>
<p>or something of that sort.</p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;re not doing the construction,</p>
<p>someone else needs to do it.</p>
<p>Someone else has to do it, right.</p>
<p>And we forget, for some reason,</p>
<p>and I too, it didn&rsquo;t occur to me until I heard it,</p>
<p>like the people who are doing construction.</p>
<p>And then of course, bike accidents and falls</p>
<p>and things like that as well.</p>
<p>Military.</p>
<p>Military, absolutely.</p>
<p>So what do you think is the potential for these compounds,</p>
<p>particular psilocybin, but other compounds as well,</p>
<p>for the treatment and possible even reversal</p>
<p>of neurological injuries?</p>
<p>And what sorts of things are you excited to do</p>
<p>in that realm?</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is definitely on the more exploratory end.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s based upon, so, you know,</p>
<p>this is sort of beyond the improvement</p>
<p>of psychiatric disorders like depression, you know,</p>
<p>or depression, anxiety associated with a terminal illness</p>
<p>or a substance use disorder, the addiction.</p>
<p>So those are sort of psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>So this is, you know, there are anecdotes of people saying</p>
<p>that psychedelics have helped heal their brain.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;ve been in one of these situations,</p>
<p>like in sports, a sport where there&rsquo;s repetitive head impact</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re claiming that, you know,</p>
<p>using psychedelics has actually improved</p>
<p>their cognitive function.</p>
<p>For example, improved their memory,</p>
<p>including improved their mood.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s kind of more of the, you know,</p>
<p>the cognitive function, things like memory are.</p>
<p>Now, the caveat is if you&rsquo;ve successfully improved</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s depression,</p>
<p>you can get some cognitive improvement too,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a more of a weaker, more indirect effect.</p>
<p>But if you take these anecdotes and you combine it</p>
<p>way across orders of analysis to the rodent research</p>
<p>from several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth,</p>
<p>these folks that have shown different forms</p>
<p>of neuroplasticity unfolding after,</p>
<p>like sort of post-acutely.</p>
<p>So after, in the days following the administration</p>
<p>of psychedelic compounds,</p>
<p>a variety of psychedelic compounds,</p>
<p>and even some non-psychedelic structural analogs</p>
<p>that you see these different forms of neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>So the growth of dendrites and new connections</p>
<p>being formed with different neurons.</p>
<p>So that those effects may be at play</p>
<p>and they improved in the psychiatric treatments</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re dealing with.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know that, it seems like a decent guess,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to be figuring out whether that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>But another potential that that sets up</p>
<p>is that maybe that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>with these claims of improvements</p>
<p>from neurological issues,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s actually a repair of the brain</p>
<p>from injuries underlying things that,</p>
<p>situations where there&rsquo;s repetitive head impact.</p>
<p>Perhaps there&rsquo;s a potential for helping folks recover</p>
<p>from stroke and disorders like that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wide variety of disorders.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a bit of magic and a bit of like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something that the enthusiasts</p>
<p>kind of can do some hand-waving</p>
<p>and claim that this is already known.</p>
<p>It is more exploratory.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m hoping to do is some work with retired athletes</p>
<p>who have been exposed,</p>
<p>but by the nature of their sport, for example,</p>
<p>NNA athletes in the UFC,</p>
<p>who have been exposed to repetitive head impacts,</p>
<p>like a lot of sports, a lot of sports expose people to,</p>
<p>and who are retired from the sport</p>
<p>and are suffering from say depression,</p>
<p>which can in part result from those types</p>
<p>of that history of head impact.</p>
<p>See if we can fix the depression,</p>
<p>but then also as a cherry on top</p>
<p>and a more exploratory aim,</p>
<p>see if we can have evidence of improvement</p>
<p>in cognitive function and associate like using MRI,</p>
<p>see if it affects gray matter over time,</p>
<p>these types of things to see if there are actually</p>
<p>some evidence of this improved,</p>
<p>like this more direct repair of the brain.</p>
<p>But again, it is very sort of like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got some rodent data, we&rsquo;ve got some human anecdotes.</p>
<p>We will acknowledge it&rsquo;s early days</p>
<p>and we look forward to seeing the data.</p>
<p>I appreciate how cautious you are,</p>
<p>and tentative you are, you&rsquo;re not drawing any conclusions.</p>
<p>I think from a purely logical</p>
<p>and somewhat mechanistic perspective,</p>
<p>I mean, if we assume that lack of ability to focus</p>
<p>or degradation in mood is the reflection</p>
<p>of neurons in the brain, I think we can agree on that.</p>
<p>Some dialogue between neurons of the brain</p>
<p>and that what needs to be changed</p>
<p>is the nature of that dialogue, aka neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>We know that reordering of neural circuitry</p>
<p>in the adult requires these things</p>
<p>like intense focus followed by rest, et cetera,</p>
<p>but the basis for that, like beneath focus is the mechanism,</p>
<p>is a mechanism rather,</p>
<p>beneath the bin that we call deep rest is a mechanism,</p>
<p>and those mechanisms are neuromodulator driven.</p>
<p>So to me, I&rsquo;m not reviewing your grant,</p>
<p>but from a rational perspective,</p>
<p>it seems that drugs that increase certain neuromodulators</p>
<p>like serotonin or dopamine in a controlled way,</p>
<p>and then coupling that with learning of some sort,</p>
<p>sensory input of some sort,</p>
<p>it makes sense that that would lead to,</p>
<p>could, I should say, lead to reordering of circuitry</p>
<p>that would allow for better thinking, better mood,</p>
<p>many of the same things that you&rsquo;ve observed</p>
<p>in the clinical trials for depression.</p>
<p>So the rationale is really strong.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a very exciting area.</p>
<p>I get asked all the time about TBI</p>
<p>and traumatic brain injury,</p>
<p>and right now, it&rsquo;s kind of,</p>
<p>there isn&rsquo;t a whole lot that people can do,</p>
<p>and people are dabbling in the space</p>
<p>of hyperbaric chambers,</p>
<p>and people do sauna and breath work,</p>
<p>and people are kind of clipping at the margins</p>
<p>of what really is a problem that resides deep to the skull.</p>
<p>So I think I just want to applaud the exploration.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great, provided that exploration</p>
<p>is being done in a controlled way.</p>
<p>It sounds like that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re doing with the UFC.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>They were really gracious and had myself</p>
<p>and a few of my colleagues</p>
<p>out to their headquarters in Vegas.</p>
<p>Impressive place, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s in process.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a dialogue going on there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hopeful that there&rsquo;s going to be some work with them,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s in process now in terms of exploring it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a real interest,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just really impressed by the organization</p>
<p>and their commitment to athlete health,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Yeah, I am too.</p>
<p>We have a colleague out there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing a little bit of work with them,</p>
<p>Duncan French, who&rsquo;s a serious academic in his own right,</p>
<p>and I think when people hear UFC,</p>
<p>they just think about the octagon and fighting</p>
<p>and pay-per-view fights and things,</p>
<p>but in talking with them,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve had these discussions as well,</p>
<p>they are very much interested in the health</p>
<p>and longevity of their fighters.</p>
<p>They are also interested in the health</p>
<p>and longevity of their fighters being a template</p>
<p>for how to treat traumatic brain injury</p>
<p>and improve human performance in other sports</p>
<p>and in the general public,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s not an image of the UFC</p>
<p>that commonly comes to mind</p>
<p>because they haven&rsquo;t been particularly verbal</p>
<p>about it in the press,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s great they&rsquo;re bringing in academics,</p>
<p>I mean, geeks like us going out</p>
<p>to the UFC Performance Center.</p>
<p>I mean, you do MMA,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m basically just a geek walking through the place,</p>
<p>but the fact that they&rsquo;re interested</p>
<p>in talking to scientists is really,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m biased here, but a point in their favor.</p>
<p>Along the lines of other groups and individuals</p>
<p>that have impacted the space that you&rsquo;re working in</p>
<p>and this pioneering of the psychedelic space,</p>
<p>a few years ago, I think if someone submitted a grant</p>
<p>saying I want to study how psilocybin</p>
<p>impacts human depression,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing, having worked on these panels before,</p>
<p>that the response might&rsquo;ve been closer to,</p>
<p>well, we need to do a lot of studies in rodents</p>
<p>and a lot of studies in primates,</p>
<p>and then maybe, just maybe,</p>
<p>we could explore these drugs</p>
<p>because the National Institutes of Health</p>
<p>actually has a whole institute devoted to addiction,</p>
<p>of exploring compounds</p>
<p>only in terms of their negative effects, right?</p>
<p>Which is a very-</p>
<p>Which is where I&rsquo;ve gotten all of my NIH funding</p>
<p>into my career.</p>
<p>Which is so interesting, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a super important institute,</p>
<p>I want to be clear, there are amazing people there.</p>
<p>But philanthropy and foundations</p>
<p>have been very important in supporting pioneering research.</p>
<p>And so maybe we just talk a little bit about that.</p>
<p>So your lab receives funding from taxpayer dollars</p>
<p>through the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>Is that mainly where your funding comes from?</p>
<p>So our group has gotten some funding</p>
<p>from, say, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA.</p>
<p>For some, a small subset of the psychedelic work,</p>
<p>but only for some work geared towards</p>
<p>understanding these things as drugs of abuse.</p>
<p>Of course, when you do a study, though,</p>
<p>you can have-</p>
<p>Show us how they&rsquo;re-</p>
<p>Explore how they&rsquo;re bad.</p>
<p>Right, but when you&rsquo;re doing that,</p>
<p>you can explore the good stuff, too.</p>
<p>But the large majority of the work,</p>
<p>and the most interesting work,</p>
<p>has been funded by philanthropy.</p>
<p>Private philanthropy.</p>
<p>I still have some great support from NIDA</p>
<p>outside of psychedelics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m shifting more and more of my time</p>
<p>towards focusing only on psychedelics.</p>
<p>And in fact, us getting the center-level funding</p>
<p>from some really big-picture philanthropists</p>
<p>helped me to start to make that transition.</p>
<p>But groups like the Hefter Research Organization,</p>
<p>Dennis McKenna, which is one of the founding members,</p>
<p>the brother of Terrence McKenna,</p>
<p>who is, by the way, an ethnobotanist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what his PhD is in.</p>
<p>What does that mean, ethnobotanist?</p>
<p>Studying essentially the anthropology</p>
<p>of psychoactive plant use.</p>
<p>You can get a degree in that?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Hanging out with cultures and studying their use</p>
<p>of these compounds in the traditional ways.</p>
<p>At Hopkins?</p>
<p>That degree exists at Johns Hopkins?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that degree exists at Hopkins,</p>
<p>but I mean, kind of the most&hellip;</p>
<p>You know, as you know from academia,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, you know, sometimes folks,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how many people&rsquo;s PhD</p>
<p>is actually in ethnobotany,</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s actually in something else,</p>
<p>but the real focus is, like,</p>
<p>my degree is general experimental psychology.</p>
<p>10,000 kids out there just decided</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to major in ethnobotany,</p>
<p>but, you know, the&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, one of the pioneers of the psychedelic area</p>
<p>before Leary and before, and actually,</p>
<p>he was late even for the human researchers,</p>
<p>folks like Humphrey Osmond and Abraham Hoffer</p>
<p>and Sidney Cohen were earlier,</p>
<p>but even before those folks,</p>
<p>Richard Schultes at Harvard, he was,</p>
<p>I mentioned him earlier in the conversation,</p>
<p>discovered all of this,</p>
<p>these various tribes using ayahuasca or yage,</p>
<p>a different name for the same thing,</p>
<p>throughout South America,</p>
<p>and these DMT-containing snuffs and all of this.</p>
<p>So, you know, that was, you know, ethnobotany,</p>
<p>this kind of intersection of anthropology</p>
<p>and these psychoactive plant compounds.</p>
<p>So the Hafter Research Institute,</p>
<p>which Dennis is a founding and active member of,</p>
<p>a board member,</p>
<p>they have funded a lot of our early work.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also an organization called the Beckley Institute</p>
<p>based in England that Lady Amanda Fielding</p>
<p>has been the head of that has,</p>
<p>they provided the first funding</p>
<p>for our psilocybin smoking cessation research</p>
<p>and the Hafter came in and provided subsequent funding.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, and then there are other groups,</p>
<p>Council on Spiritual Practices,</p>
<p>a great guy named Bob Jesse</p>
<p>funded some of the original work at Hopkins</p>
<p>looking at the nature of mystical experience</p>
<p>outside of treating disease states or disorders,</p>
<p>but just understanding these,</p>
<p>like people take these compounds</p>
<p>and astonishingly, you know,</p>
<p>frequently will say that was the most important</p>
<p>everything I&rsquo;ve ever experienced.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what the hell is that?</p>
<p>Yeah, I had someone mentioned recently,</p>
<p>I think this might surprise people a little bit,</p>
<p>certainly surprised me.</p>
<p>I had a friend who adores his children.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got three children.</p>
<p>He adores his children.</p>
<p>Happy marriage and great, great father.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both great parents.</p>
<p>And he told me that as part of a clinical trial,</p>
<p>he had a DMT experience</p>
<p>that he claims, he said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to tell you that the birth of my children</p>
<p>was as profound,</p>
<p>but that was a more profound experience</p>
<p>than the birth of my children,</p>
<p>any one of them and all of them combined.</p>
<p>And I was like, wow, now I&rsquo;ve never done DMT,</p>
<p>but I was like, wow, that&rsquo;s a pretty strong statement.</p>
<p>Now he did it in the context of one of these,</p>
<p>you know, clinical explorations.</p>
<p>I assume that was part of a legal clinical trial,</p>
<p>but the, I mean, that&rsquo;s saying something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s saying something.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s a very rational, very grounded guy otherwise.</p>
<p>But so philanthropy, foundations, and then-</p>
<p>Most recently.</p>
<p>And so I just, I can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>cause I can&rsquo;t skip it.</p>
<p>Our center level funding,</p>
<p>which came a year and a half.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, we, I mean, the Hefter group,</p>
<p>the Beckley group, I mean, these are wonderful.</p>
<p>I mean, these are people that have been holding</p>
<p>the flame alive during the darkest hours,</p>
<p>like the rain.</p>
<p>Same thing with MD, with the MAPS organization</p>
<p>on more on the MDMA side,</p>
<p>like holding that candle during the darkest years that,</p>
<p>you know, so we&rsquo;ve,</p>
<p>but, you know, smaller organizations connected to smaller,</p>
<p>but growing over time, you know, pockets of wealth.</p>
<p>But, you know, we basically limped on,</p>
<p>limped along on a wing and a prayer until recently</p>
<p>when we got the $17 million gift</p>
<p>so that we could create a nominal center.</p>
<p>And as you know, basically to the university,</p>
<p>that means you get a certain number of dollars</p>
<p>and a lot of them, you can call yourself a center.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a capital investment,</p>
<p>you know, staff, you know, equipment, salary support,</p>
<p>which has always been the huge thing for us.</p>
<p>But the $17 million gift,</p>
<p>which was split between the Cohen Foundation,</p>
<p>so Steven and Alexandra Cohen,</p>
<p>they covered half of it.</p>
<p>And the other half, the Tim Ferriss Collaborative,</p>
<p>basically Tim and a few friends ponied up that the,</p>
<p>you know, divided the rest of that,</p>
<p>half of that $17 million gift and came together to just,</p>
<p>I mean, it just, it&rsquo;s completely transformed our,</p>
<p>the work that we&rsquo;ve done and our ability to,</p>
<p>you know, like to fully delve into this area</p>
<p>and not worry that like, oh, if I focus on this,</p>
<p>rather than putting another three NIDA grants</p>
<p>on some other topic that may or may not get funded,</p>
<p>like if I focus too much on the psychedelics,</p>
<p>am I putting my career at jeopardy?</p>
<p>But like, so-</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re now not only a tenured professor,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also a full endowed.</p>
<p>Right, so that came a few months ago.</p>
<p>By the way, when you say somebody</p>
<p>is a fully endowed professor,</p>
<p>I want to be very clear what that means.</p>
<p>That means that there&rsquo;s funding-</p>
<p>Well, it might mean all of the above, but no, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>I have no knowledge of your particular situation,</p>
<p>but you probably do.</p>
<p>Just kidding.</p>
<p>But sure, the, these,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re essentially saying is that funding,</p>
<p>which does not change somebody&rsquo;s salary level,</p>
<p>I just want to be clear,</p>
<p>because I think the general public isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no reason why they would understand</p>
<p>all the nuts and bolts of how this works.</p>
<p>Academia is weird.</p>
<p>Yeah, academia is weird</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not talking about increasing,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not talking about an endowment that,</p>
<p>or philanthropy that went to increase Matt&rsquo;s salary.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s set at the university level.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always been said, and it is,</p>
<p>at least it&rsquo;s still true now,</p>
<p>which is that nobody goes into science for the money,</p>
<p>at least not at the academic level,</p>
<p>not in academia.</p>
<p>But allows people to devote more of their time and energy</p>
<p>to these exploratory realms like psychedelic research</p>
<p>or in the case of my lab,</p>
<p>the work that we&rsquo;re doing with David Spiegel&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>on respiration, breathwork, and hypnosis</p>
<p>for modulating brain states.</p>
<p>These are not typically areas</p>
<p>that the National Institutes of Health</p>
<p>and other major organizations</p>
<p>have institutions set up to support.</p>
<p>Now, there is an exciting initiative,</p>
<p>which is the NCCIH, which is Complementary Health.</p>
<p>Right, used to be NCAM.</p>
<p>Yeah, at NIH. Yeah, they changed their name, yeah.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re not just throwing out acronyms</p>
<p>just to bat back and forth acronyms,</p>
<p>but I think what we&rsquo;re seeing now</p>
<p>is a movement toward science and scientists and clinicians</p>
<p>and the general public and philanthropy</p>
<p>being engaged in this dialogue which says,</p>
<p>okay, there are problems in the world,</p>
<p>depression, head trauma, psychological trauma,</p>
<p>PTSD, ADHD.</p>
<p>These problems clearly exist.</p>
<p>The solutions are going to involve behaviors</p>
<p>that are going to involve nutrition,</p>
<p>supplementation, social connection.</p>
<p>However, there are drugs,</p>
<p>there are compounds that can change the brain</p>
<p>and allow the brain to change its circuitry</p>
<p>through experience.</p>
<p>And psychedelics are one of several others,</p>
<p>but one of the powerful levers, it sounds like.</p>
<p>And I just want to say that I think</p>
<p>the reason I reached out to you</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m so excited to sit down and chat with you</p>
<p>is because I see very few people</p>
<p>inside the halls of academia</p>
<p>who have thrown their arms around this issue of psychedelics</p>
<p>in a way and gone through the trouble</p>
<p>of trying to find the funding to get it done,</p>
<p>gone through the trouble of trying</p>
<p>to set up clinical trials.</p>
<p>I know what&rsquo;s involved in doing this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so complicated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so time-consuming and painstaking.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve made real progress.</p>
<p>I mean, you guys are publishing papers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a new dialogue emerging</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t just books on bookshelves</p>
<p>and psychedelic, psychonaut gurus on the internet</p>
<p>who also play an important role,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re really moving this field forward.</p>
<p>And I know there are others as well.</p>
<p>There are colleagues in England and others as well.</p>
<p>We acknowledge them.</p>
<p>But I just want to say personally</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m inspired and impressed</p>
<p>by the way that you&rsquo;ve gone about this</p>
<p>and the level of rigor.</p>
<p>I mean, when I ask you a question about serotonin,</p>
<p>most people just kind of kick back to me.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, you got receptors and you got a ligand,</p>
<p>but I mean, it&rsquo;s clear to me that you care about the details</p>
<p>and that you care about the future of this area.</p>
<p>And you also really care about these patients</p>
<p>and these individuals.</p>
<p>So I know I&rsquo;m speaking on behalf of a ton of people now</p>
<p>and in the future that don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re going to receive as a consequence of this.</p>
<p>I just want to voice a real sincere thank you</p>
<p>for that effort.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like your lab and your work matters.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a really special and unique thing.</p>
<p>I appreciate that.</p>
<p>I had a good colleague, in fact,</p>
<p>shared some grant support under the multi-PI system years ago</p>
<p>and she actually took a job at NIH as a review officer.</p>
<p>And I remember her telling me,</p>
<p>and she actually left when she had multiple R01s.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, she didn&rsquo;t need to-</p>
<p>Those R01s are kind of the bread and butter big grants</p>
<p>that every card carrying,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a mark of respect in our community</p>
<p>to have one or several of these, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, and it&rsquo;s like, you eat what you kill in academia.</p>
<p>It gets to what we&rsquo;re talking about later.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you don&rsquo;t make more money</p>
<p>by pulling more grants,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re able to pay the salary that like,</p>
<p>the university doesn&rsquo;t pay you your salary.</p>
<p>It goes through them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just able to do more work.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you&rsquo;re able to like,</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t pull in the grants to cover your salary,</p>
<p>your job can come to an end.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re tenured at a place like Hopkins,</p>
<p>they can do tricks like slowly lower your salary over these.</p>
<p>Or they just let you,</p>
<p>you know, continue to take these things.</p>
<p>Or they just take away your space.</p>
<p>Yeah, they put you in a closet</p>
<p>and give you no support for trainees</p>
<p>and basically make life hell for you.</p>
<p>So you could drive a cab in Baltimore</p>
<p>and call yourself a full professor at Hopkins, truthfully,</p>
<p>but you may have no ability to get anything done.</p>
<p>But yeah, I remember one of the things this colleague</p>
<p>who said, who is successful, but left on top said,</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m making a difference in the world.</p>
<p>And she did some great memory research</p>
<p>and connected to drugs, also connected to aging.</p>
<p>But she said, I don&rsquo;t feel the impact</p>
<p>of what I&rsquo;m doing in the real world.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, you know, unfortunately there</p>
<p>for a lot of academia, what we do,</p>
<p>it stays in the ivory tower.</p>
<p>You know, the world is a, you know.</p>
<p>Not anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful but messed up place.</p>
<p>And like a lot of this doesn&rsquo;t disseminate.</p>
<p>And because of the various structures,</p>
<p>the way the world is set up and thankfully this,</p>
<p>I mean, because the work that our group,</p>
<p>as well as a few others around the world</p>
<p>over the last 20 years,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you do have an emerging psychedelic</p>
<p>startup industry now with billions of dollars of investment.</p>
<p>And yet that&rsquo;s going to turn into both good and bad.</p>
<p>Like, you know, it&rsquo;s upping the ante.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of good and bad</p>
<p>that comes from that.</p>
<p>But any new technology is going to result in that.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve got psilocybin designated</p>
<p>for two separate entities as a breakthrough therapy</p>
<p>by the FDA.</p>
<p>And people may not realize,</p>
<p>and MDMA is designated as a breakthrough therapy for PTSD.</p>
<p>This is a really big deal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very high, I mean,</p>
<p>pharma companies would pay millions of dollars</p>
<p>to get their new drug a designation like that.</p>
<p>And what it means is early research is saying</p>
<p>it shows a high potential for treating disorders</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have very good treatments.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re, and we&rsquo;re probably, again,</p>
<p>a few years away from both MDMA</p>
<p>and probably a year or two after that psilocybin</p>
<p>being treated for PTSD and depression, respectively.</p>
<p>We have to wait for the phase three studies,</p>
<p>but if the results hold up,</p>
<p>even if the effect size is like halved</p>
<p>of what we&rsquo;re seeing now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still going to be a lot larger</p>
<p>than what you&rsquo;re seeing with the traditional medications.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s going to be approved if the data hold up,</p>
<p>and it probably will from my judgment.</p>
<p>So I feel like what I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>is actually having a positive impact in the world</p>
<p>in a way that, and I feel lucky that I got interested</p>
<p>in an area that happens to plug into a place</p>
<p>in the world where there is that opportunity,</p>
<p>where some great colleagues and friends</p>
<p>are focused on areas where I wish they had the opportunity</p>
<p>for their work to be disseminated.</p>
<p>I wish, I mean, I was lucky to be interviewed</p>
<p>on 60 Minutes because of this work.</p>
<p>And it was like, oh my God, I know so many,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bit of imposter syndrome.</p>
<p>Like, oh my God, I know so many scientists</p>
<p>that deserve more so than me to be,</p>
<p>have that level of exposure.</p>
<p>But if you happen to be in that place</p>
<p>where you got to do your best to make it work,</p>
<p>to take advantage of that luck</p>
<p>and that intersection of the world and to push it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been lucky,</p>
<p>but also did take a bit of a leap of faith early on.</p>
<p>I did have some advisors that told me like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got a really promising pedigree early on.</p>
<p>Like, are you sure you want to focus</p>
<p>much time on the psychedelic stuff?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve embraced risk.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that,</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s changed since in 2020, certainly,</p>
<p>but channels like social media, podcasts</p>
<p>and things of that sort,</p>
<p>your exposure is because people are interested</p>
<p>in these topics.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why people like myself</p>
<p>are interested in talking to you.</p>
<p>I mean, at Stanford, there are now a few labs</p>
<p>starting to explore psychedelics</p>
<p>more at the mechanistic level.</p>
<p>But so in animal models, some excellent labs,</p>
<p>but also I can imagine,</p>
<p>because of the pioneering work that you&rsquo;ve done at Hopkins,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll start to become more common.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain that people are going to have questions</p>
<p>about how to get in contact with you and learn more.</p>
<p>If people have trauma, PTSD, depression,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s likely that they&rsquo;re going to start seeking ways</p>
<p>in which they can potentially</p>
<p>participate in clinical trials.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very active on Twitter.</p>
<p>Active, I should say, you&rsquo;ve got other obligations,</p>
<p>but where you are active on social media,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re active on Twitter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s drug, it&rsquo;s at drug downscore researcher.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Drug underscore researcher.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how to find me.</p>
<p>Great account, by the way.</p>
<p>Matthew and I recently got into a dialogue there</p>
<p>about some of the deeper effects of psychedelics</p>
<p>in the literature versus how they&rsquo;re being discussed</p>
<p>in the general public.</p>
<p>And I follow his account.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really wonderful account</p>
<p>for whether or not you have a science background or not.</p>
<p>If people are interested,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to try and persuade you</p>
<p>to be more active on Instagram,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll succeed in that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to get my Instagram game going on.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a busy guy and I get it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m running a lab too.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re busy, but drug downscore researcher there as well.</p>
<p>Same handle.</p>
<p>Same handle.</p>
<p>Your lab at Hopkins is pretty straightforward to find</p>
<p>through a Google search of your name,</p>
<p>Matthew Johnson, Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>Are there portals for people to explore clinical trials,</p>
<p>participation in clinical trials of various kinds?</p>
<p>In our group, so you go to hopkinspsychedelic.org.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the website.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t remember that,</p>
<p>just Johns Hopkins Psychedelic.</p>
<p>Yeah, we will provide a link.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to find us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be the first thing that pops up.</p>
<p>And we have, trust me, if we have a study on something,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be on that website.</p>
<p>That means they&rsquo;re being very polite.</p>
<p>So I will be a little bit more aggressive and say,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t email him directly.</p>
<p>He won&rsquo;t see that email.</p>
<p>Wait until there&rsquo;s a posting for a study</p>
<p>and then sign up through the correct portal.</p>
<p>And I try to get back to those emails,</p>
<p>but frankly, and it&rsquo;s because, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m lucky the area has taken off so much,</p>
<p>but there are many days where I simply get so many requests</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t get through my day.</p>
<p>Yeah, if I answer all the&hellip;</p>
<p>So, yeah, trust me.</p>
<p>And something that a lot of folks don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>in being in academia like we are,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to forget how people don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>understandably don&rsquo;t realize this.</p>
<p>This is experimental research.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s FDA approved as an experiment, you know,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re working towards formal FDA approval</p>
<p>for straight up clinical use.</p>
<p>But right now someone can&rsquo;t bring me a case</p>
<p>of some idiosyncratic thing and say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m suffering from this complex constellation</p>
<p>of depression.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not a clinician.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not a clinician.</p>
<p>And even if I was,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to treat them with psilocybin</p>
<p>or to send them anywhere that was legal to take it.</p>
<p>You know, so if we&rsquo;re going to be treating you,</p>
<p>it has to be, or anyone else in the United States,</p>
<p>or most other countries for that matter,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to have to be under the guise</p>
<p>of a very specific protocol.</p>
<p>This number of milligrams to treat PTSD,</p>
<p>to treat major depressive disorder,</p>
<p>to treat, you know,</p>
<p>treatment resistant tobacco use disorder,</p>
<p>so nicotine addiction.</p>
<p>Very specific studies.</p>
<p>This is not one-off treatment.</p>
<p>Folks say like, oh, I can pay to go out to Baltimore</p>
<p>if you see, oh, my son has this, you know, complex,</p>
<p>like in their tragic cases.</p>
<p>But so if you&rsquo;re interested in a study,</p>
<p>go to our website.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not on their website, you know,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have a study on it.</p>
<p>There are going to be forthcoming studies.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to be starting studies</p>
<p>on opioid addiction and PTSD</p>
<p>and an LSD study for chronic pain.</p>
<p>The day that those are open for recruitment,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to be up on our website.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where you look to see everything.</p>
<p>And in fact, I would just recently,</p>
<p>a couple of days ago,</p>
<p>put up a couple of survey studies,</p>
<p>also where we post links to our survey studies.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve had psychedelics</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve taken them for therapeutic intent for PTSD</p>
<p>or for depression or anxiety, you can find a link.</p>
<p>And also if you&rsquo;ve done breath work for those reasons,</p>
<p>we have a link for a study of that type up there now,</p>
<p>which is a holotropic style,</p>
<p>very psychedelic type of breathing technique</p>
<p>that can lead to some of these similar experiences.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s up there.</p>
<p>More broadly, outside of our group,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a growing number of groups in the US</p>
<p>doing this, and in Europe doing this research,</p>
<p>but you can go to clinicaltrials.gov.</p>
<p>And if you look in for the main search term of psilocybin</p>
<p>or MDMA or psychedelic, plug in those terms,</p>
<p>you can get a list of the growing number.</p>
<p>I mean, I think there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s over 40, maybe it&rsquo;s been a while,</p>
<p>there might be over 50 now, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but studies with just psilocybin going on right now</p>
<p>on clinicaltrials.gov.</p>
<p>So check out clinicaltrials.gov to see what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s going to be, if you&rsquo;re going to do anything legal,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be in the context of a very specific study.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to be one-off treatment.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I should say, not just legal,</p>
<p>but also supported in the right framework</p>
<p>that you described of having a team, et cetera.</p>
<p>Obviously people will do what they will do.</p>
<p>And, oh, yeah, go ahead.</p>
<p>I will say, if people,</p>
<p>I never encourage people to take drugs of any,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t encourage caffeine use.</p>
<p>Every drug has its risk.</p>
<p>I encourage my own caffeine use, but nobody else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m drinking up right now.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is a very strong mate is what we&rsquo;re drinking.</p>
<p>It does not lead to a alteration in my perception of self</p>
<p>to the extent that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>However, this conversation wasn&rsquo;t a good example</p>
<p>of how we can enter a perceptual bubble.</p>
<p>I learned so much about psychedelics</p>
<p>and the future of this for sake of mental health</p>
<p>and other aspects of health.</p>
<p>Matt, thank you so much for your time, for your knowledge.</p>
<p>And I think you put it best earlier</p>
<p>for holding the candle in a very dark time.</p>
<p>And then now there&rsquo;s light.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Well, thanks for helping to spread that light.</p>
<p>And I really appreciate what you&rsquo;ve been doing.</p>
<p>This is a great, great medium that you have going on.</p>
<p>So thank you for doing it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my pleasure.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me for my conversation</p>
<p>with Dr. Matthew Johnson.</p>
