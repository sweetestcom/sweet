    <p>Hi friends, so recently I found a hack for life. And of course, I&rsquo;m gonna share it with you</p>
<p>So I found out a way to always know how to handle something anything that comes up</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know how to handle it. You don&rsquo;t know how to conduct yourself. You don&rsquo;t know the answer. I&rsquo;ve got you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found the solution</p>
<p>This is how to always know what to do and how to never get caught in the in-between of like not knowing which</p>
<p>Decision to make whether it comes to something small something big like breaking up staying together dealing with people dealing with a job</p>
<p>Dealing with money any fucking situation big or small beating the fuck out of somebody or not. I don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>This is my new hack</p>
<p>I found to always know what to do because there&rsquo;s nothing worse</p>
<p>Than going through something and not knowing what to do or not</p>
<p>Trusting someone&rsquo;s answer because I&rsquo;ve been through a lot of shit where no one had an answer for me</p>
<p>No one knew how to help me get through things and a lot of shit</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t know at the time like I didn&rsquo;t know how to handle certain things</p>
<p>I know a lot now because I&rsquo;ve had a fucking go through it but going through it was a pain in the ass</p>
<p>So this is my trick for knowing what to do. Even before you&rsquo;ve gone through it</p>
<p>The first thing you have to realize is that you&rsquo;re always being looked after and what I mean by you&rsquo;re always being looked after</p>
<p>Think back to a time in your life where you were going through something and it was fucking you up and you didn&rsquo;t know what to</p>
<p>Do you didn&rsquo;t know how to handle it?</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t know if you would make it through</p>
<p>think back to that time and right now you can think back to the older version of you and you see the</p>
<p>Situation from your perspective right now</p>
<p>So you can look back and see all the answers that younger you needed and you can see exactly how the situation</p>
<p>Unfolded you can look back and see exactly how you handled it and exactly how you got through it</p>
<p>But when you were going through it in the time you felt alone</p>
<p>You feel like you didn&rsquo;t know what to do. You were scared, but you were never alone</p>
<p>Cuz right now how you can look back on the younger version of you that was going through something your future self is</p>
<p>Looking back on you right now and they see the answers. They see how you got out of a situation you&rsquo;re in right now</p>
<p>They see the changes that you had to make your future self knows all the answers and they&rsquo;re looking back on you</p>
<p>Just how you can look back on your younger self. Your future self is looking back on you. You&rsquo;re never alone</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never lost</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re always being looked after by yourself and I don&rsquo;t want to get too spiritual with the shit about</p>
<p>Time and how it&rsquo;s an illusion and all that but there&rsquo;s a version of you that has made it through what you&rsquo;re going through right now</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a version of you that has the answer and this is something that has brought me so much comfort and</p>
<p>I never had this to remind myself of when I was going through my toughest shit. Like I felt so alone and</p>
<p>Some of the hardest things that I&rsquo;ve gone through and I&rsquo;m just like fuck having this realization would have been nice back then</p>
<p>Cuz I really was so hopeless for so long</p>
<p>But me now can look back on me two years ago</p>
<p>The me that was struggling as fuck and didn&rsquo;t think he was gonna make it the me that almost didn&rsquo;t make it</p>
<p>I can look back on him and see that you&rsquo;re gonna be okay</p>
<p>So anytime you&rsquo;re going through something or you&rsquo;re having to deal with something just remember there&rsquo;s a version of you</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s already been through it and they&rsquo;ve handled the situation. You&rsquo;re currently in there&rsquo;s a version of you that made it out and</p>
<p>Recently, I realized you can tap into this</p>
<p>You can tap into the version of you who&rsquo;s already made it through for the advice</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need anybody else to tell you a fuck thing</p>
<p>You can literally give yourself the guidance you need and since I realized this</p>
<p>Everything has changed the way that I&rsquo;ve been living</p>
<p>My life has changed the way that I am has changed like bitch</p>
<p>I feel so much more supported than I ever have because it&rsquo;s me. It&rsquo;s me and future me and that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>So the trick that I&rsquo;ve been using is when I&rsquo;m going through some shit</p>
<p>I will envision my future self like the version of me</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a millionaire the version of me that can handle anything and it does not give a fuck like I don&rsquo;t give a fuck now</p>
<p>But future me millionaire me don&rsquo;t have time to give a fuck like he truly don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>And he truly knows how to handle everything. He&rsquo;s just got this calm</p>
<p>Sense of security and his ability to handle whatever the fuck happens. And that&rsquo;s what I like to try and tap into</p>
<p>So I will envision myself my future self. That&rsquo;s a millionaire</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking figured it all out and is just like</p>
<p>Sitting here with his hands folded looking at me like what like, you know</p>
<p>I mean like I don&rsquo;t know how to paint that picture, but the future version of me just pops in my head</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to create him. I don&rsquo;t have to think of</p>
<p>Like the details like when I just envision my future self. I see the way he dresses</p>
<p>I see the way he conducts himself</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s sitting there with a fucking little cigarette and a pinky ring looking at me like, okay</p>
<p>Tell me your problem and I&rsquo;ll fix it for you in two seconds</p>
<p>Like my future me just don&rsquo;t give a fuck like he just knows it all. He&rsquo;s so smart. He&rsquo;s successful</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t be stopped by anything and I don&rsquo;t have to create that</p>
<p>So a lot of people are like, oh my god envision your future self picture it</p>
<p>No, it just comes up when you ask yourself when you and try to envision the future self like the version that you want to become</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fight the initial image that comes up like whatever comes up is meant to come up. That&rsquo;s your intuition</p>
<p>so when you think of your future self the the image of them is just gonna pop up and mine is a</p>
<p>mean motherfucker</p>
<p>My future self is not mean he just does not put up with no bullshit and I get worried sometimes like looking to him for</p>
<p>Advice cuz like he&rsquo;s just so</p>
<p>Capable and is so just can&rsquo;t see why I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just like here&rsquo;s the answer not go do it like it&rsquo;s gonna suck</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be scary, but get it the fuck done like future me is no bullshit</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;ll do is when I have a problem come up or I have a situation come up</p>
<p>I will ask myself how would future me handle this?</p>
<p>What would future me do and I&rsquo;ll like think of the future me and I just get the answer</p>
<p>It just comes out of nowhere</p>
<p>Recently I was dealing with a debate with somebody not really a debate. I was fighting with him</p>
<p>Okay, like I was arguing with</p>
<p>Someone that I used to be very very close to and the conversation was going nowhere</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m very aware and I&rsquo;m aware enough to the point where I can see where I&rsquo;m jaded</p>
<p>I can see the entire mess of a friendship or a relationship</p>
<p>Like I under I can see it all like it all is unfolded in front of me. I can see my perspective</p>
<p>I can see theirs I can see what&rsquo;s wrong with mine and what&rsquo;s wrong with theirs and why there&rsquo;s no resolution</p>
<p>I can see it all it&rsquo;s very obvious to me, but I&rsquo;m also at a point now with that awareness</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay. I know the work it&rsquo;s gonna take to mend this relationship and create repair</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t have the time</p>
<p>To do that one</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to sacrifice my goals and what the fuck I want to work on to go create repair in this relationship and</p>
<p>To the type person that I&rsquo;m trying to create repair with is that even a person that I want in my life?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m able to see things at a level that pisses me off because I&rsquo;m like now I have to choose not to do it</p>
<p>So I was in like a text fight with this person like back and forth back and forth</p>
<p>Like I can just see it wasn&rsquo;t gonna go anywhere</p>
<p>I was getting pissed off like it was physically like making me fucking mad like I was sweating</p>
<p>I was pissed like it was ruining my mood every time these texts were coming up</p>
<p>and I was just like goddamn and I literally just asked myself how what would future me do and</p>
<p>Future me would fucking ignore them literally just in the middle of the conversation. Just fucking ignore it</p>
<p>I said the things I felt I needed to say I got out what I needed to get out</p>
<p>But my boundaries are not up for fucking discussion future me can see it&rsquo;s not gonna go anywhere</p>
<p>I can see that now too, but future me sees that and chooses accordingly. So you see it&rsquo;s gonna go nowhere</p>
<p>So what are you gonna do dumbass?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna sit here and keep wasting your fucking time</p>
<p>What a situation, you know is gonna go nowhere and you don&rsquo;t want to create repair with this person because you don&rsquo;t want this person</p>
<p>Close to you. So what the fuck are you wasting your time for ghost?</p>
<p>Protect your mental sanity protect your mood protect what you&rsquo;re working on and quit letting this conversation</p>
<p>Continue if it&rsquo;s pissing you off and it it&rsquo;s useless like future</p>
<p>Me is no bullshit future means just like ignore it be done with it quit engaging in conversation</p>
<p>Like a future me holds me accountable. He&rsquo;s like fucker. You know what you&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>I quit and it&rsquo;s kind of annoying like every time I ask future me for advice</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like damn like he calls me out</p>
<p>Like he just calls me out about how I&rsquo;m choosing things and how I&rsquo;m contributing and he gives me the solution</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all I sound like schizophrenic. I thought y&rsquo;all gonna lock me up in a loony bin</p>
<p>Okay, this is it. This is the better way to explain it. It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m talking to my future self, but I</p>
<p>Tap into my future self&rsquo;s perspective and how he would look at the situation</p>
<p>Because how my future self looks at situations is different than how I do future me sees different solutions</p>
<p>Future me conducts himself differently and is a lot more prioritized and strategic than I am</p>
<p>Me currently going through what I&rsquo;m going through means I&rsquo;m wrapped up in the emotions of it. I&rsquo;m stuck in it</p>
<p>Everything seems like such a bigger deal and I feel a lot more confused about what steps to take and what to do</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m emotionally in it like I&rsquo;m emotionally feeling things, but the future me is an objective perspective</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s gonna look back. He&rsquo;s not feeling it. He&rsquo;s able to be strategic</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s able to just look back and see what&rsquo;s going on and call it for what it is</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m the one fucking up</p>
<p>my future self like tapping into that perspective is when I&rsquo;m gonna see that I am fucking up and where I&rsquo;m contributing and</p>
<p>Also by handling</p>
<p>Situations like the future me would it&rsquo;s doing nothing but turning me into future me the version of me</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like sitting there with a pinky ring smoking and has no fucking care in the world because he knows he can face anything</p>
<p>Behaving like him is what&rsquo;s gonna turn me into him. It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna bridge that gap between me now and him</p>
<p>So when I say pinky ring now, I&rsquo;m gonna go into how I actually tap into the future version of myself</p>
<p>So last week I bought a pinky ring and I know that future me</p>
<p>I said has the pinky ring, but this is just funny how this all lined up</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna take you back before I had this realization about tapping into my future self a week ago</p>
<p>I bought a pinky ring from Gucci</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a gold lion with two crystals in the eyes and then inside the lion&rsquo;s mouth is a red Swarovski crystal</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like the lions biting it it&rsquo;s the most sexy fucking ring you&rsquo;ve ever seen in your life</p>
<p>this is a very sentimental thing to me because when I</p>
<p>Was 19 I went to Miami with my cousins and me and my cousin Adrian got matching Gucci rings</p>
<p>It was his exact ring</p>
<p>But it had a yellow stone in its mouth and he got a silver one with like a green stone or a blue stone</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember but we both got matching Gucci rings</p>
<p>But over the years like I just</p>
<p>transformed into so many different versions of myself that I stopped wearing it and then I lost a bunch of weight and now the</p>
<p>Ring doesn&rsquo;t fit anymore. So it&rsquo;s like two sizes too fucking big</p>
<p>But I came across this gold one with the red stone and I was like, oh my fucking</p>
<p>God, like I have to have that like I just was so drawn to it. I&rsquo;ve never loved something more in my fucking life</p>
<p>I saw it online. So immediately I go texting my Gucci sales associate. I&rsquo;m like, hey, babe</p>
<p>Do you have this in my size and I sent her a picture of it and I was like pretty please and she said yes</p>
<p>So I took off to the store and bought it immediately</p>
<p>But I can&rsquo;t explain to you like the way that I just don&rsquo;t give a fuck when I have this ring on</p>
<p>Since I put it on when I got it</p>
<p>I got it and wore it out of the store</p>
<p>Like I just I haven&rsquo;t given a fuck about anything since I&rsquo;ve had this ring</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the weirdest but the best little like mind fuck</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just something about a pinky ring, but only a certain type of person could pull off a pinky ring</p>
<p>You know like it&rsquo;s got it. You gotta be like bold. You can&rsquo;t be no pussy bitch with a pinky ring</p>
<p>You know what? I mean? It just fits my aesthetic perfectly. It&rsquo;s the prettiest fucking ring obsessed with it</p>
<p>I have it on right now, but how I said, I just don&rsquo;t give a fuck when I have on this pinky ring</p>
<p>I started using it as a way to tap into my future self. So this is where my trick comes in</p>
<p>So the other day I was sitting at my table and I had a long list of shit to do and I was like</p>
<p>I really just want to go take a nap</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t want to fucking do none of it like there was just so much work shit</p>
<p>I needed to do and I was just like, ah like god damn it</p>
<p>I looked at my ring and I put it on and as soon as I&rsquo;ve slid the ring on my finger</p>
<p>it was like I jolted into this fucking energy of like</p>
<p>Not giving a fuck like it was so like just get up and get it done like that power</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s what it is</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sense of power like came over me me acting like I have a magic fucking ring</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being dramatic but like really I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>but I put this ring on and it&rsquo;s like my entire attitude flipped of like</p>
<p>Whiny and bitchy and being like I don&rsquo;t want to do this way</p>
<p>I want to take a nap it flipped into like alright fucker</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get it done</p>
<p>Like that forward moving like don&rsquo;t give a fuck version of me came out and I was like, oh shit</p>
<p>Like that was very much like future me energy. And then in that moment, I realized yo</p>
<p>I can use this ring as like a time to tap into that energy that I want of like fuck it</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just do it</p>
<p>And then I was kind of like at the same time having realizations about the future self thing and I was like, you know</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m gonna declare right now. Like I want to use this ring to</p>
<p>Tap into the future version of myself the version of me. That&rsquo;s a motherfucking millionaire and knows how to handle anything</p>
<p>I want to say billionaire, but I don&rsquo;t want to be a billionaire that just comes with a lot of pressure</p>
<p>You know, like I&rsquo;m okay. I&rsquo;m really okay. I&rsquo;ll take a couple hundred million to be on my way</p>
<p>But I am dead ass. I have never</p>
<p>Felt something like this before like with the ring analogy with tapping into my future self</p>
<p>so I had a coaching call later that day and</p>
<p>I was kind of like feeling down and not like the most energized for it and I was like, okay Leo</p>
<p>You need to get on this call and like you need to help this person</p>
<p>You need to give them the advice that they need like you&rsquo;re here to like help them</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t have time really to be down that you got to kick your ass in the high gear</p>
<p>so I</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t force myself to try and get in a better mood or like try and be up or anything like usually that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>But instead I was just like fuck it</p>
<p>I grabbed my ring and I was like I&rsquo;m gonna tap into future me like I&rsquo;m just gonna turn into future me as I put</p>
<p>this on and I&rsquo;m gonna give this person the fucking advice that they need and I put the ring on and</p>
<p>Immediately I felt like the level up it wasn&rsquo;t like an Ascension</p>
<p>But kind of like I just felt like boosted and like leveled up of like I&rsquo;ve got this I&rsquo;m capable</p>
<p>I can do it like this overwhelming sense of capability and like trust in myself just like</p>
<p>Came up</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s when all the vision of future me started pouring in of like how he looks how he dresses how he handles shit</p>
<p>The perspectives he holds of like what&rsquo;s serious and what&rsquo;s not like being tired is not gonna hold you the fuck back from giving advice</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not gonna get in the way of you helping someone fucker get up. It was the nicest</p>
<p>Supported feeling I&rsquo;ve ever felt like I just feel so capable and empowered when I tap into future me</p>
<p>But giving myself something physical to actually use</p>
<p>To signify that I am tapping into him. I can&rsquo;t explain to you</p>
<p>How fucking intense that is so I&rsquo;ve been toying with this like I&rsquo;ll never just propose an idea to you guys</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m always gonna apply it first make sure it fucking works and it works like the more that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>Been tapping into future me. I know how to fucking handle anything. I just have the answers</p>
<p>They just come to me like I I don&rsquo;t even have to fucking question it basically tap into the perspective of my higher self and</p>
<p>Think the way that he does what would he do in this situation?</p>
<p>Not what the fuck I&rsquo;m doing so then I immediately know like what to do</p>
<p>This is a very powerful tool</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a painful one because I have to step into a full place of accountability when I do this like there&rsquo;s no more</p>
<p>Lying to myself and pretending. I&rsquo;m doing better than I actually am and pretending that shit&rsquo;s actually hard</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like once I tap into that perspective like I see shit for what it really is and there&rsquo;s no denying it</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no getting out of it. There&rsquo;s no like lying to myself or trying to comfort myself</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re hit with the abrasive reality of like the truth and then it&rsquo;s not keep walking forward like</p>
<p>The answer is just fall out like they just are there</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s painful to have to be facing the reality of a situation all the time</p>
<p>You know like sometimes it&rsquo;s nice to distract yourself</p>
<p>But tapping into future me is what it&rsquo;s gonna fucking take to get to where I want to go</p>
<p>Like just think of the version of you that&rsquo;s already got what it is you want. How do they fucking behave?</p>
<p>What do they do and then find a way to tap into them you can do it just mentally like I was able to do</p>
<p>It mentally and I still can because sometimes I don&rsquo;t have the ring on or like when I&rsquo;m in the gym</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t have the fucking ring because I&rsquo;m not gonna work out on my nice-ass ring. I</p>
<p>Do still tap into myself. I just like having the physical</p>
<p>representation of it and like a physical</p>
<p>Ritual I can do to like feel like I&rsquo;m fully switching into future me</p>
<p>But like at the gym if there&rsquo;s somebody there that I want to talk to I no longer I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>Oh in my head thinking about it talking myself out of it. Like if I find a guy</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in if I like the way somebody looks and I&rsquo;m like, oh, he&rsquo;s cute</p>
<p>If I consider like talking to them before I&rsquo;ll talk myself out of it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say what would future me do future me would walk the fuck up confidently and talk to them if I&rsquo;m interested in them future</p>
<p>Me don&rsquo;t hesitate future me. Don&rsquo;t give a fuck future me is not walking away from a situation</p>
<p>Wondering and having a mystery future me likes solid. He likes knowing he doesn&rsquo;t like the unknown</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s gonna go up and if there&rsquo;s a chance for it to go somewhere</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna go for it so he can know</p>
<p>But this has helped me talk to a lot more people at the gym and recently</p>
<p>I just posted a tick tock with my friend Leslie of us working out at the gym and we just talk shit and we recorded</p>
<p>Ourself and we had the microphone on and when I first got there</p>
<p>I was a little bit in my head about like, oh my god</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to be the asshole in the gym recording himself with a fucking microphone on but I immediately just tapped into</p>
<p>Future me and I said, what would future Leo do?</p>
<p>What would millionaire Leo do and the answer was not give a fuck</p>
<p>The answer was make a good-ass video if people are gonna look give them something to fucking watch</p>
<p>Future me don&rsquo;t put up with nothing and future me especially does not put up with second-guessing myself</p>
<p>Being insecure or questioning my value. I made the video. I had so much fun with Leslie</p>
<p>We literally had a fucking blast and I have watched our tick-tock together so many times</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so funny. Like she&rsquo;s just I&rsquo;ve gotten to know her the past like a couple of weeks months</p>
<p>Maybe I don&rsquo;t know like she&rsquo;s one of my first like good friends in Houston</p>
<p>Like I have a few now like I have some friends but Leslie like we just blend so fucking well together our personalities</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s just so fucking great. And I&rsquo;m so glad I didn&rsquo;t let myself get in my head about it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always so resistant to like record myself in the gym</p>
<p>But she kind of like helped me with that and then also it&rsquo;s happening to future me future me</p>
<p>Knows he can make a good video and if he has to make it in front of a bunch of people so be it</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not gonna stop him. Like basically future me looks at me and</p>
<p>Kind of judges me. He&rsquo;s like, are you really not gonna do something because you&rsquo;re scared?</p>
<p>Really? Like is that your excuse? Oh, I was scared</p>
<p>Future me don&rsquo;t allow me not to do things just because I feel scared or feel worried</p>
<p>I push through and go through in any way because that&rsquo;s what future me does</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s really it. Like are you really not gonna do something because you&rsquo;re scared bitch for real?</p>
<p>Being scared of something is just your imagination</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the way that you&rsquo;re looking at a situation if you make up your mind that something can go bad or that something is</p>
<p>Scary, you&rsquo;ve just made up your mind that it&rsquo;s scary. The unknown is not scary</p>
<p>So whenever you feel fear, it&rsquo;s something that you have in your head</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve decided how this situation is gonna go and if you say it&rsquo;s gonna go bad</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;re scared when in reality, there&rsquo;s a 50-50 chance if it can go good or it can go bad</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two sides you can focus on if you focus on it going good</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna feel that scared if you focus on it going bad, you&rsquo;re gonna feel fucking scared</p>
<p>So when you realize fear is just a figment of your fucking imagination and that the unknown is not scary</p>
<p>The unknown is neutral</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just scared of what you think is in the unknown</p>
<p>Same thing with the dark if you convince yourself as a fucking monster in your room with you when you turn the light off</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be scared</p>
<p>But the dark itself is not scary</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re really not gonna do something just because you decided something in your head that might not even be right</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much uncertainty to that that I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable taking the chance of not trying something just because I&rsquo;m scared</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t fucking know at all. I</p>
<p>really hope all that makes sense because now I&rsquo;m like off on a tangent and I&rsquo;m kind of just like ranting about fear and</p>
<p>Future me don&rsquo;t operate that way and since I stopped operating that way</p>
<p>Shit&rsquo;s been changing girl</p>
<p>Like a whole bunch has been changing like I&rsquo;m doing a lot of things differently and I&rsquo;m making so much progress</p>
<p>Mentally and in my physical life with things that I&rsquo;m doing and also the way that I feel</p>
<p>While doing everything is so different. Like I just feel so much better and I feel very</p>
<p>Supported and that&rsquo;s something that I haven&rsquo;t really felt</p>
<p>Before but it&rsquo;s not like a support from somebody else</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like future me&rsquo;s always got my back future me. I can always lean on he&rsquo;s always there</p>
<p>I can tap into a person that is all-knowing and that has my best interest at heart at all times</p>
<p>And I guess that is what I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s someone that I know that I can trust that they&rsquo;re just looking out for me</p>
<p>Like most people have had a hidden motive and they&rsquo;ve convinced me that I need to do something because it&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>But really it just benefited them. It wasn&rsquo;t actually for me</p>
<p>But with future me, there&rsquo;s no ulterior motive</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no hidden agenda like when I tap into future me I get that like parent aspect</p>
<p>I guess and like the sense of someone&rsquo;s got me and it&rsquo;s real like I can trust it</p>
<p>That feeling is one of the best ones I&rsquo;ve ever felt</p>
<p>This has been the only thing that has helped me not</p>
<p>Overthink something or second-guess it like I&rsquo;ve never thought I made the wrong decision</p>
<p>Anytime I&rsquo;ve acted from what would future me do like I don&rsquo;t second-guess shit</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the smarter version of me that knows everything and he knows exactly what to do</p>
<p>And if I just tap into that and ask him I&rsquo;m not making a mistake</p>
<p>There is no chance to make a mistake</p>
<p>The only mistake I can make is acting off of me in my emotional state right now</p>
<p>But when I get into the logical all-knowing state of my future self, there&rsquo;s no mistake to be made</p>
<p>So then you don&rsquo;t second-guess anything</p>
<p>Something else I noticed about tapping into future me is all of my insecurities go away</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a confidence that lives there. There&rsquo;s not any insecurity there like the version of me that&rsquo;s been through it</p>
<p>Knows what the fuck he&rsquo;s doing. He&rsquo;s confident</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not insecure and when I use his lens to look at my situation</p>
<p>I can see where the insecurities that I have are not real</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not valid and I know how to kick them and then I have this confidence of like, yeah</p>
<p>I fucking know what I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>Like even if there&rsquo;s a situation where it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know exactly what I&rsquo;m gonna do</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m confident and the fact that I know I&rsquo;ll be able to handle it either way</p>
<p>Because I have future me to rely on like I have that perspective to tap into at all times</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like of the version of me. That is smarter richer faster better than me. I</p>
<p>have no problem taking advice from that person and</p>
<p>Alex Hermosi has posted something along the lines of this is like when you&rsquo;re confused or you&rsquo;re in a situation where you don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>To do think about how someone who is ten times smarter than you would handle it</p>
<p>How would they handle the situation that I&rsquo;m going through and I kind of do that with my future self and I promise you</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be so much different than how you thought to handle it</p>
<p>But the first answer that just pops into your head, that&rsquo;s that intuition and that is the future you it&rsquo;s the it&rsquo;s the answer</p>
<p>That comes without you having to try and pull an answer out</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just this sense of knowingness that comes when you ask yourself the question</p>
<p>So that is my little hack that I&rsquo;ve found that has been changing my entire fucking life if you start trying this or you start</p>
<p>Doing this, please DM me and tell me if it works, bitch</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t tell me if it works</p>
<p>Tell me when it works</p>
<p>Tell me how much it works because I know it&rsquo;s going to and like I said, you don&rsquo;t have to go buy a ring</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to go buy anything. You can tap into this at any time</p>
<p>Mentally, but if you want to get something get some kind of symbol that you can use to like put on yourself</p>
<p>So that you can feel like you&rsquo;re turning into the future you it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re tapping into that</p>
<p>perspective and that energy</p>
<p>Immediately because another thing I noticed with this ring is when I put it on I get energy like I don&rsquo;t know what it is</p>
<p>Like I get a boost of energy</p>
<p>Like if I&rsquo;m thinking about doing something and I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t want to fucking do it and then I&rsquo;m like, okay</p>
<p>What would future me do when I put the ring on?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I get this boost of energy of like handle it like I&rsquo;m just ready to do it</p>
<p>So having a physical ritual and like a little tool has helped me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll post the picture of my ring on Instagram</p>
<p>So you guys can see it because I know you&rsquo;re all gonna want to know what it looks like now, but just cute</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so fucking pretty and</p>
<p>One more piece to this cuz you know, I gotta take things too fucking far</p>
<p>I look to my future self a lot of the times for comfort too because I can look back on me two years ago</p>
<p>Wondering why the literal fuck are things happening to me the way that they are</p>
<p>Like when I was freaking out and I was so confused and I was so scared and I didn&rsquo;t understand why things were happening</p>
<p>Your future self knows</p>
<p>Because right now I can look back on me two years ago and see exactly why everything had to line up the way that it</p>
<p>Did for me to get to where I am now</p>
<p>So your future self has that so anytime I get confused or worried or scared or I&rsquo;m like why the fuck is this happening?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason for it and I will become aware of the reason shortly</p>
<p>But just knowing that future me made it through and knows exactly</p>
<p>Why this all had to line up the way that it did it&rsquo;s so comforting like I get a weird-ass</p>
<p>Comfort out of that because I love to know things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so fucking nosy like I like to know everything all the things all the time like I&rsquo;m so aware and I practice</p>
<p>Being able to recognize shit like at the level that I do cuz I need to fucking know</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to not know things. I&rsquo;d like to know everything</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d really did just want to bring that up for the people who are wondering why certain things are happening to them</p>
<p>Your reassurance is it&rsquo;s all gonna make sense in time. It might not be quick</p>
<p>It might not make sense soon</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taken me a fucking two years to finally see why what happened to me needed to happen to get me here</p>
<p>But the answer is there you&rsquo;re gonna line up with it in time</p>
<p>Future you already knows it like all the things that I know about my life so far being 24</p>
<p>I can see everything that&rsquo;s happened on my road of success and the goals that I&rsquo;m trying to hit and I&rsquo;m like mother fucker</p>
<p>I can see everything I&rsquo;ve had to do and I&rsquo;m like, holy shit and future me is sitting there like boy</p>
<p>You are only a third of the way fucking through buckle up like future</p>
<p>Me is just looking back on me like laughing like oh look at you</p>
<p>Look at you doing all the little beginner stuff like the version of me who&rsquo;s already achieved it</p>
<p>All is appreciative of me going through what I&rsquo;m going through right now and what I&rsquo;m doing. He&rsquo;s acknowledging it</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s seeing it. I&rsquo;m being watched over and you are too</p>
<p>Like your future self is watching you your future self has your back and you can always trust that</p>
<p>Any insight you get from asking these fucking questions you can trust it and you have free will so you can go against</p>
<p>What you think you should do to become your future self</p>
<p>But acting in line with the version of yourself that you see is what&rsquo;s gonna turn you into them</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna send you off there</p>
<p>But I will leave all my usernames to my social media in the description of this podcast, I&rsquo;ll put my Instagram</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also put my tick-tock or you can watch the video of me and Leslie at the gym</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s funny as hell</p>
