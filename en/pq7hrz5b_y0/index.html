<p>combination between keto and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting is what you need to</p>
<p>do for stomach surgery because you not</p>
<p>eating so frequent is gonna take a lot</p>
<p>of stress off that tissue so anything</p>
<p>surgery wise you need to do in a minute</p>
<p>fasting as a healing thing so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be really important all right so</p>
<p>all right Karen is it how do we look on</p>
<p>YouTube I just have a tension on that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s okay we&rsquo;re just pulling YouTube</p>
<p>up now okay then I have a caller yes I</p>
<p>do want to call her okay great well we</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>taxes hey Ruth from Texas yeah and she</p>
<p>says her 76 year old mother has lost</p>
<p>weight with keto 76 year old mother lost</p>
<p>weight with keto for some reason she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want all that loose flabby skin</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s want to know should she eat</p>
<p>more okay so she feels too thin how does</p>
<p>she stay in that that mode where she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>building up her connective tissue well</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing the pro here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>problem with doing keto you may lose too</p>
<p>much weight so in that case you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have to increase your fats okay increase</p>
<p>your fats not start increasing your</p>
<p>protein or carbs increase more fat have</p>
<p>big meals probably don&rsquo;t go lower than</p>
<p>two meals a day like don&rsquo;t go to one</p>
<p>meal a day just go to two meals a day</p>
<p>and spread them on a little bit further</p>
<p>and have bigger meals now another thing</p>
<p>with the loose skin is that if it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>the lower belly I did a video recently</p>
<p>on that lower belly pooch that you can</p>
<p>do reverse situps or so watch that</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re standing and you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>back stretching your abdomen to really</p>
<p>tighten up that loose skin in the lower</p>
<p>part so that&rsquo;s definitely something that</p>
<p>you can do and then the other thing that</p>
<p>you can do is basically make sure you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t snack because in a minute fasting</p>
<p>is the main thing that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>tighten the skin so I just want to ask</p>
<p>Steve for a second you are you and are</p>
<p>you sure that YouTube is on my channel</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t see any anyone subscribe</p>
<p>yeah so what I&rsquo;m gonna try Steve is I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna try something here I&rsquo;m gonna try</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>cuz I think this is not working alrighty</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see now camera nice dream there</p>
<p>you go</p>
<p>next yeah so this is interesting</p>
<p>yeah thank you everybody</p>
<p>what hey there just hanging out while</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re sorting things out okay so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>live yeah so yeah well let&rsquo;s just see</p>
<p>for example because I want to know on</p>
<p>YouTube if you guys can can see me and</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s working so go ahead and let me</p>
<p>know I know Facebook thanks for your</p>
<p>patience we just want to get this</p>
<p>YouTube thing going and let&rsquo;s see hello</p>
<p>how about that so it may take a couple</p>
<p>seconds to get this working you see that</p>
<p>really nice thing in the top of mine my</p>
<p>ceiling there all those cords hanging</p>
<p>out that looks wonderful so okay we have</p>
<p>a question from Donna yes how much</p>
<p>cheese can you eat a day should you eat</p>
<p>low-fat or full fat cheese Donna wants</p>
<p>to know how much cheese can you eat per</p>
<p>day in ounces or pounds and then does it</p>
<p>was the last part it should be low-fat</p>
<p>should it be a low-fat or a high fat</p>
<p>okay so the thing about cheese</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re not living in</p>
<p>Wisconsin is that you want to not overdo</p>
<p>it the cheese Jesus sometimes</p>
<p>constipating so that could be an issue</p>
<p>so I personally would recommend probably</p>
<p>3 to 4 ounces with a meal you can do</p>
<p>that twice a day and you should be fine</p>
<p>now don&rsquo;t do the low-fat cheese do</p>
<p>higher cheese higher amounts of cheese</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m sorry high fat cheese like</p>
<p>brie cheese because that&rsquo;s gonna slow</p>
<p>down the glycemic index when you do lean</p>
<p>low-fat cheese you&rsquo;re gonna stimulate</p>
<p>insulin</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not good so that is the</p>
<p>problem and I&rsquo;m looking at Facebook and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anyone can see</p>
<p>me I don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m sorry YouTube so for</p>
<p>some reason we apologize YouTube hop on</p>
<p>to Facebook yeah I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on yeah yeah so we&rsquo;re gonna look</p>
<p>at that all right give me another</p>
<p>question Karen Florida Stephen you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from Florida you had a question yes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s taking the adrenal cortisol relief</p>
<p>supplement is okay with the nutritional</p>
<p>yeast so one question at a time</p>
<p>and so one one if Steve wants to know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a product called adrenal relief and</p>
<p>cortisol relief okay so that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>product I have if you wanted to know can</p>
<p>you take that with nutritional yeast</p>
<p>because when they cross over because</p>
<p>they both have nutritional yeast well</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing the cortisol relief</p>
<p>formula has nutritional yeast and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty it&rsquo;s not nearly the amounts the</p>
<p>quantity of regular nutritional yeast so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good for stress but if you want if</p>
<p>you want if you&rsquo;re looking more for</p>
<p>adapting Aikido and you want the full be</p>
<p>complex and b12 it might be better just</p>
<p>to do the nutritional yeast but the</p>
<p>other ones specific for stress because</p>
<p>it also has herbal stuff for stress and</p>
<p>it targets more the adrenal than just</p>
<p>the B vitamins okay Karen okay good all</p>
<p>right good I want another question okay</p>
<p>good blushing and was told to go down to</p>
<p>one meal a day and continue adrenal</p>
<p>massaging and supplements there hasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>been any change and not losing weight</p>
<p>alright Karen can you ask me that a</p>
<p>little bit like in a condensed version</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a long question some sure</p>
<p>blushing chronic blushing eating</p>
<p>one meal a day but no change in the</p>
<p>blushing or weight yeah well if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about rosacea or blushing</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a difference if it&rsquo;s if it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>increased fleshing of your face that</p>
<p>occurs just randomly and it&rsquo;s not there</p>
<p>permanently that is a problem with your</p>
<p>nervous system it&rsquo;s part of the</p>
<p>autonomic nervous system and the</p>
<p>autonomic nervous system is has two</p>
<p>parts the flight-or-fight</p>
<p>and the recovery and rest sympathetic</p>
<p>compare so in that case you need to</p>
<p>support the Drina maybe with more</p>
<p>nutrition and it could take a lot longer</p>
<p>you probably be you&rsquo;d benefit to take</p>
<p>the adrenal supplements in addition to</p>
<p>using the massage tool to do the stress</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t recently I did a webinar on</p>
<p>how to use that and how to take stress</p>
<p>out of your body you should probably</p>
<p>watch that but now let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>blushing or the redness in the face is</p>
<p>all it&rsquo;s permanently there it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>constant thing they called that rosacea</p>
<p>that could be coming from a vitamin C</p>
<p>deficiency now either you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>consuming enough vegetables or you are</p>
<p>your digestive system or stomach isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>working enough to absorb the vitamin C</p>
<p>you actually need good stomach acid to</p>
<p>absorb vitamin C and you also need good</p>
<p>friendly bacteria to absorb vitamin C</p>
<p>that could be one reason and last reason</p>
<p>is that if your insulin resistant you</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t be able to absorb out them and</p>
<p>see either so that could be a big</p>
<p>problem okay so good question - and we</p>
<p>have a million questions here I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to ask Steve can you comment on my</p>
<p>YouTube for me your end over there and</p>
<p>see if it shows up because I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>working but I can&rsquo;t prove it</p>
<p>yeah okay in the meantime we have Janet</p>
<p>who says she&rsquo;s starving when she wakes</p>
<p>up in the morning intermittent fasting</p>
<p>is hard to start okay Janet is starving</p>
<p>in the morning and she says that</p>
<p>intermittent fasting is very hard to</p>
<p>implement can she do it from 8 a.m. to 2</p>
<p>p.m. can she do it from 8 a.m. to 2 a.m.</p>
<p>yeah yeah 2 p.m. now you know here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing I recently did a video I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>remember if I released it or not I may</p>
<p>have I may have not I don&rsquo;t remember but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the point some of you need to</p>
<p>adjust the the pattern around your your</p>
<p>lifestyle so let&rsquo;s say for example you</p>
<p>need a lot of your energy in the morning</p>
<p>and the mid-afternoon versus that night</p>
<p>you may want to just eat at 8 a.m. and</p>
<p>then eat again at 12 or even 2 so you</p>
<p>start off here in him and fasting and</p>
<p>then you fast from 12 or 2 all the way</p>
<p>to 8 o&rsquo;clock in the morning there&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>reasons for that number one your stomach</p>
<p>is mostly acidic at 8 o&rsquo;clock in the</p>
<p>morning so it&rsquo;s ready to digest all this</p>
<p>protein versus late at night if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna eat a big meal it&rsquo;s harder to</p>
<p>sleep on a large fatty meal or a protein</p>
<p>meal so you might want to play around</p>
<p>with the frequency but yeah it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really matter when you eat as much as</p>
<p>the pattern - I would fit the pattern</p>
<p>into your lifestyle what would work</p>
<p>better if you find that especially when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re adapting you&rsquo;re tired in the</p>
<p>morning because you&rsquo;re not eating until</p>
<p>12 eat and then just don&rsquo;t eat at night</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trying to wind down so that</p>
<p>might might work and gosh I think I</p>
<p>released that video but I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>double-check so I didn&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll release it</p>
<p>really quick looks like there&rsquo;s a plea</p>
<p>scare in common I have alopecia</p>
<p>okay I&rsquo;ll answer that in a second and</p>
<p>doc tell YouTube</p>
<p>on private so we&rsquo;re gonna end the stream</p>
<p>and come back up and see if we can do it</p>
<p>okay yeah just go ahead and end it we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna end the stream on YouTube and come</p>
<p>back up so we&rsquo;ll work on that all right</p>
<p>okay so alopecia okay that&rsquo;s where you</p>
<p>have this hair loss in different places</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called an autoimmune disease and</p>
<p>that usually comes after a stress event</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really the adrenal being a problem</p>
<p>and the adrenals are producing an</p>
<p>imbalance in your immune system because</p>
<p>the adrenals controlled the white blood</p>
<p>cell so when you actually lose that</p>
<p>control your body velop santé bias</p>
<p>against your own hair the way to solve</p>
<p>that is not with a remedy the way to</p>
<p>solve that is by going after really</p>
<p>fixing the core health problem that you</p>
<p>have especially the adrenals so I would</p>
<p>recommend get on key to them and a</p>
<p>fasting make sure you&rsquo;re all your</p>
<p>nutrients there and the biggest thing is</p>
<p>do things to reduce stress long walks if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some stressful thing in your</p>
<p>life</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to avoid that person</p>
<p>or thing and just because you&rsquo;re there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no way you&rsquo;re gonna heal from an</p>
<p>autoimmune if you&rsquo;re a constant under</p>
<p>stress you really want to kind of be of</p>
<p>a stress-free life with putting in these</p>
<p>basics all right all right Karen do we</p>
<p>have any questions coming in at all yes</p>
<p>we have just now from Iowa okay she gets</p>
<p>a lot of cramps in her feet and calves</p>
<p>and has a history of joint problems and</p>
<p>patella femoral and plantar fasciitis</p>
<p>how should she address this well when</p>
<p>you have plantar fasciitis a lot of</p>
<p>people have plantar fasciitis and they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really have plantar fasciitis</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s pain in the bottom of the</p>
<p>feet you know especially if it&rsquo;s on the</p>
<p>right side it&rsquo;s gonna be gallbladder</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t ask me why it&rsquo;s just gonna be</p>
<p>gallbladder working a goal better it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>go away but the point is that you have</p>
<p>inflammation you need to do keto in a</p>
<p>minute fasting hardcore because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be the best thing to reduce</p>
<p>inflammatory conditions now if you want</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>fix the plantar fasciitis part what you</p>
<p>want to do is you want to stretch the</p>
<p>opposite side of the foot if the pain is</p>
<p>in the bottom you stretch the top part</p>
<p>of the foot so when you and I have a</p>
<p>video on this you can kneel so your your</p>
<p>feet are flat so you&rsquo;re stretching your</p>
<p>toes downward not the calf and that will</p>
<p>really get rid of your plantar fasciitis</p>
<p>I really like that word plantar</p>
<p>fasciitis that&rsquo;s a cool word is it</p>
<p>working yeah</p>
<p>Facebook Elliot is asking what can be</p>
<p>done for vertigo vertigo this is a great</p>
<p>movie vertigo know now vertigo dizziness</p>
<p>and vertigo is easier like there&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>reasons for that number one if you stand</p>
<p>up real fast and you get vertigo</p>
<p>that is a classic adrenal because the</p>
<p>adrenals that cause your body to adapt</p>
<p>to the position of movement quick and</p>
<p>your adrenals are weak you can&rsquo;t push</p>
<p>the blood flow up to your brain fast</p>
<p>enough all right good</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m on which one but does this work</p>
<p>okay good all right sorry about that</p>
<p>guys just working out these fun little</p>
<p>glitches so if you get up fast and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dizzy that means it&rsquo;s adrenal</p>
<p>okay so if you have and in that case</p>
<p>what you want to do hey youtube we</p>
<p>finally got you guys online if you</p>
<p>actually get up too fast and you have an</p>
<p>adrenal issue you can actually take your</p>
<p>blood pressure okay take your blood</p>
<p>pressure lying down and then standing up</p>
<p>you have the top number in the bottom</p>
<p>number you have the systolic top number</p>
<p>and the bottom number there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>diastolic</p>
<p>if you have stand-up what will happen</p>
<p>with your vertigo the blood pressure the</p>
<p>top number drops down by six 200 or 210</p>
<p>points normally it should go up so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna feel like whoa I&rsquo;m feel</p>
<p>dizzy just because of lack of blood flow</p>
<p>so that means the adrenals are low</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re weak so you want to support them</p>
<p>I would recommend using my sleep aid for</p>
<p>the sleep because the sleep is the best</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s going to put you into the</p>
<p>Delta wave sleep and start recovering</p>
<p>adrenals in addition you know do the</p>
<p>acupressure technique it&rsquo;s on my webinar</p>
<p>under stress so you might want to check</p>
<p>that out good so now we finally got some</p>
<p>some people on YouTube YouTube and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just going to click there yeah I&rsquo;m ready</p>
<p>for a call ok Gerardo from Los Angeles</p>
<p>he fasts 24 hours because he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>hungry</p>
<p>Geraldo from Los Angeles Gerardo and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s basically fasting for 24 hours</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s not hungry thousand</p>
<p>calories a day basically he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>wondering should he force himself to eat</p>
<p>more he&rsquo;s lost thirty pounds this is a</p>
<p>really good question Karen I was waiting</p>
<p>for this question and now you answered</p>
<p>it I asked it now you asked your ro ass</p>
<p>yes that&rsquo;s right so here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>when you dookied on a minute fasting</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna be hungry and you could</p>
<p>probably go for a long period of time</p>
<p>and your body is just actually in this</p>
<p>fat-burning mode if you have a lot of</p>
<p>weight to lose you B want to ride the</p>
<p>wave and go ahead and keep going more</p>
<p>than 24 hours the only thing I would</p>
<p>recommend is to take nutrition with that</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s electrolytes or nutritional</p>
<p>yeast just to get the electrolytes in</p>
<p>there so you have some nutrients but</p>
<p>maybe not without the calorie the reason</p>
<p>for that is that your body is in a nice</p>
<p>state of fat-burning you feel fine you</p>
<p>keep going and maybe you&rsquo;ll be hungry</p>
<p>the next day but that is a problem and</p>
<p>you have to make a judgment call if you</p>
<p>are going into this with nutritional</p>
<p>deficiencies and you go longer than 24</p>
<p>hours we don&rsquo;t want you to feel dizzy</p>
<p>because your electrolytes drop and you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have enough fluids with</p>
<p>electrolytes so it&rsquo;s a judgment call but</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s really up to you you might</p>
<p>want to experiment and go for a little</p>
<p>bit</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have to necessarily eat</p>
<p>that frequent there are people that I</p>
<p>know that do this they eat every 48</p>
<p>hours and they feel fine from it</p>
<p>especially when the here they spend all</p>
<p>this time and we&rsquo;re getting the body in</p>
<p>the fat burning and it&rsquo;s like almost</p>
<p>euphoric and they just can keep going</p>
<p>and going and going and going and they</p>
<p>just feel wonderful so that&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>suggest you do alright alright so Laura</p>
<p>Lori Lorraine has a question about the</p>
<p>benefits of nutritional yeast Karen she</p>
<p>wants to know what are the benefits okay</p>
<p>and the benefits are you get natural B</p>
<p>vitamins ok these vitamin B vitamins are</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna reduce your stress and they</p>
<p>act as cofactors Co helper vitamins for</p>
<p>all sorts of metabolic processes so they</p>
<p>prevent problems with protein digestion</p>
<p>they prevent your from your mood going</p>
<p>down but mainly what I&rsquo;ll notice when</p>
<p>people take nutritional yeast is they</p>
<p>just have a stress relief they feel like</p>
<p>calm if you drink coffee and you feel</p>
<p>that jittery take nutritional yeast it</p>
<p>just gets rid of it if you if your</p>
<p>spouse is irritating you slip it in</p>
<p>their coffee and they&rsquo;ll be really nice</p>
<p>to you so these are all these things</p>
<p>that you can do alright good</p>
<p>all right can give me a question ok</p>
<p>great so we have someone from YouTube</p>
<p>here says Sheila your YouTube videos</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s 24 year old son who&rsquo;s extremely</p>
<p>extremely extremely thin she says very</p>
<p>very thin and cannot gain weight help</p>
<p>ok so Karen said we have a caller a</p>
<p>mother who has a son that has a very</p>
<p>very skinny</p>
<p>he can&rsquo;t gain weight and that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>a really important topic for most of you</p>
<p>listening because you want to gain</p>
<p>weight right now I have a video on this</p>
<p>and the problem is you want to gain</p>
<p>muscle you don&rsquo;t want to gain fat right</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>the more you do in a minute faster</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get lean so if someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>younger and they want to gain weight</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be a problem I think we can</p>
<p>actually make them healthier and we</p>
<p>might be able to make them more muscular</p>
<p>and just overall bring them to their a</p>
<p>balance but it&rsquo;s going to be kind of a</p>
<p>lean state because if you want to fatten</p>
<p>someone up just go with the starches</p>
<p>goin potatoes and rice and beer as a</p>
<p>sumer sumo wrestler would consume and</p>
<p>eat that multiple times of the day but</p>
<p>it comes with a package the sumo</p>
<p>wrestlers they eat like very frequent</p>
<p>meals but they&rsquo;re so-called healthy well</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not really healthy they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>exercising so much because when they</p>
<p>stop exercising they develop all sorts</p>
<p>of health problems they fall apart once</p>
<p>they retire so I&rsquo;m gonna recommend that</p>
<p>for your son what he had three meals a</p>
<p>day no snacks but just really increased</p>
<p>the meals so he&rsquo;s having large</p>
<p>quantities of food and a lot of fat to</p>
<p>prevent the loss and then start getting</p>
<p>him into an exercise program and even</p>
<p>involving weight training where you can</p>
<p>start increasing more weight and develop</p>
<p>the muscles that&rsquo;s what I would do if I</p>
<p>were you but I wouldn&rsquo;t go for the</p>
<p>starches all right all right so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see Karen what do we got coming down the</p>
<p>pike okay good so we have Jessica on</p>
<p>Facebook who&rsquo;s asking you to speak a</p>
<p>little bit about pregnant women and keto</p>
<p>is all right so we have another question</p>
<p>on Facebook regarding pregnant women and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting thank you</p>
<p>and kido well if you&rsquo;re pregnant I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna recommend that you don&rsquo;t do any</p>
<p>type of crazy in a minute fasting and I</p>
<p>would just recommend three meals but I</p>
<p>would recommend no snacks and I would</p>
<p>recommend taking the B vitamins or</p>
<p>nutritional yeast a and trace minerals a</p>
<p>plant-based trace mineral because the</p>
<p>trace minerals will prevent all sorts of</p>
<p>problems in a kid a growing fetus and</p>
<p>will eventually develop into a child for</p>
<p>example if you&rsquo;re deficient in iodine it</p>
<p>can actually you can have a smaller size</p>
<p>brain and you can even affect your</p>
<p>child&rsquo;s IQ</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s important to do the the trace</p>
<p>minerals or the seek help the other</p>
<p>thing is if the child is low in</p>
<p>manganese they can end up with flat feet</p>
<p>or even scoliosis so there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>importance that we&rsquo;ve been putting these</p>
<p>basic nutrients in there especially the</p>
<p>fat soluble vitamins vitamin A D and K</p>
<p>and I would recommend my daughter-in-law</p>
<p>is pregnant so we have her doing virgin</p>
<p>cod liver oil high quality grass-fed</p>
<p>butter trace minerals B vitamins but not</p>
<p>the synthetic petroleum based vitamins</p>
<p>that they give women prenatals which is</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t like those at all where can</p>
<p>someone buy nutritional yeast you can</p>
<p>get it at health the store or online</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty readily I have it in a</p>
<p>tablet form you can get it if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to take it as a powder good good</p>
<p>questions can I&rsquo;m ready for another one</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>again on Facebook and I apologize</p>
<p>because I cannot pronounce this name but</p>
<p>she gets watery diarrhea after eating</p>
<p>her vegetables alright no stool for</p>
<p>about three days all right he&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>scared of vegetables she&rsquo;s lost 95</p>
<p>pounds but this has been happening for</p>
<p>three weeks okay so we have another</p>
<p>question about someone consumes</p>
<p>vegetables and they get pretty severe</p>
<p>diarrhea after that and it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>even form stools after a period of time</p>
<p>so in this case there&rsquo;s a couple things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna recommend stop consuming those</p>
<p>vegetables and you may need to start</p>
<p>doing small amounts of steamed</p>
<p>vegetables consume vegetables like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve never eaten before word like</p>
<p>different types and see if that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>problem and then the last thing you</p>
<p>could try is fermented if that still</p>
<p>produces this diarrhea then you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have to try to do get your nutrients</p>
<p>from other sources you know whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be nuts or mushrooms or other</p>
<p>vegetables things like that or</p>
<p>proteins because you don&rsquo;t want to keep</p>
<p>doing that obviously your body doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the flora and that&rsquo;s really what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>missing so you&rsquo;re gonna have to build</p>
<p>that back up there&rsquo;s a certain probiotic</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m gonna recommend it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>effective microbes I&rsquo;m not going to tell</p>
<p>you what brand but you can just look it</p>
<p>up effective microbes it&rsquo;s called eeehm</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a synergistic effect of all these</p>
<p>if like 400 different strains of</p>
<p>microbes that really help grow all the</p>
<p>strains of microbes and you take some</p>
<p>before you go to bed all night long it</p>
<p>builds up in your gut and now you can</p>
<p>actually digest a lot better now if you</p>
<p>have diarrhea there&rsquo;s a couple things</p>
<p>you can do blackberry and some really</p>
<p>high-quality unsweetened plain yogurt or</p>
<p>kefir normally I don&rsquo;t recommend that</p>
<p>for keto but in your case I would blend</p>
<p>it up in a shake drink that a few times</p>
<p>during the day activated charcoal is</p>
<p>another thing you can take for diarrhea</p>
<p>as well and that could it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>help absorb poisons and toxins okay so</p>
<p>we got to talk to Mary now Mary is on</p>
<p>Facebook I am the opposite I am solid</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d solid constipation I eat my</p>
<p>vegetables drink my water if I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>take meds I don&rsquo;t go to the bathroom so</p>
<p>okay so now we have someone that gets</p>
<p>constipated constipation well the same</p>
<p>thing</p>
<p>those fibers in the vegetables are not</p>
<p>broken down by the microbes so you need</p>
<p>more microbes</p>
<p>I would I would consume steamed</p>
<p>vegetables to make it easier to break</p>
<p>down and then a portion of that have</p>
<p>fermented vegetables okay so that would</p>
<p>that that would be a lot better than</p>
<p>some of these raw if you if you</p>
<p>constipate you because you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>be constipated alright good all right</p>
<p>Karen what do we got okay we have a</p>
<p>caller Karen from Arizona Karen from</p>
<p>Arizona is calling in yes her husband</p>
<p>has dementia</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s on keto Ania okay her husband has</p>
<p>dementia on keto and if&rsquo; yeah and she</p>
<p>added benefit to me</p>
<p>how much should he be taking per day the</p>
<p>tablets are 300 machines she added</p>
<p>benefit I mean benfotiamine is a</p>
<p>synthetic but very healthy form of b1</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fats I believe I be vitamin</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really good for nerve and brain</p>
<p>function and vision and preventing the</p>
<p>damage from high sugar so how much</p>
<p>should he take well I would recommend if</p>
<p>you have dementia I would take four</p>
<p>times the dosage</p>
<p>so whatever the dosages up it by four or</p>
<p>even five times the dosage because that</p>
<p>way it&rsquo;ll flood the nervous system with</p>
<p>exactly what he&rsquo;s going to need the</p>
<p>other thing that I would do is I would</p>
<p>take the nutritional yeast with it to</p>
<p>make sure you have all the B vitamins</p>
<p>but if it takes a little longer to kick</p>
<p>in that just means that you have a lot</p>
<p>of degeneration going on but it will</p>
<p>tend to reverse damage on the nervous</p>
<p>system and the brain it&rsquo;s great for</p>
<p>something called peripheral neuropathy</p>
<p>which is nerve damage on the bottom of</p>
<p>the feet okay good question though</p>
<p>alright Karen what do we got okay well</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading a few different posts on</p>
<p>YouTube ok we&rsquo;re on YouTube here mm-hmm</p>
<p>and these questions are I&rsquo;m fasting for</p>
<p>days yeah I am doing keto diet and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not losing weight and the question is</p>
<p>maybe should fast longer and longer but</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t there other reasons why a body</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be different on a scale ok so</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s what someone wanted to</p>
<p>know they&rsquo;re basically fasting for days</p>
<p>doing keto and they&rsquo;re not losing weight</p>
<p>ok what are you gonna do in that</p>
<p>situation well if you&rsquo;re not eating and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not losing weight and then I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>guessing you&rsquo;re fasting maybe it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>like completely 100 100 % fasting like</p>
<p>24 hours a day because if you were</p>
<p>eventually you&rsquo;re gonna lose weight when</p>
<p>you stop eating I promise you yeah but</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re fasting let&rsquo;s say intermittent</p>
<p>fasting maybe that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re asking</p>
<p>in a minute fasting haven&rsquo;t eaten since</p>
<p>Tuesday you&rsquo;re not losing then I would</p>
<p>find out</p>
<p>are you losing size is your waist going</p>
<p>down are you constable</p>
<p>did I had one lady who came in she drove</p>
<p>her car from Michigan to my office a</p>
<p>while ago and she was she went once a</p>
<p>month okay to the bathroom and she</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t interested in handling that</p>
<p>problem she was interested in losing</p>
<p>weight I said I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re full of it literally you need to</p>
<p>get rid of your constipation so I went</p>
<p>outside for lunch and I looked at her</p>
<p>car and it was just lined with Cheetos</p>
<p>and Oreo cookie wrappers and all sort of</p>
<p>backseat I&rsquo;m like okay so where there is</p>
<p>the problem right there so the point is</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>constipated then I would look at your</p>
<p>sleep are you sleeping do you have</p>
<p>stressed you have any other body</p>
<p>problems that could be preventing this</p>
<p>weight loss these are things that you</p>
<p>want to look at because if you don&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>you will eventually lose weight because</p>
<p>your body is in that mode give it more</p>
<p>time well I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>be building that much muscle and gaining</p>
<p>weight when you&rsquo;re not eating</p>
<p>so because you need a certain amount of</p>
<p>protein to prevent the atrophy of muscle</p>
<p>so in your question honestly I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>say you&rsquo;re gonna have to watch a lot of</p>
<p>my videos and get my book to get all the</p>
<p>details because there&rsquo;s probably more</p>
<p>things that are going on then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>telling me at this point I can&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>evaluate based on what you told me all</p>
<p>right good next question hormone versus</p>
<p>desiccated people ok so Karen had</p>
<p>another question about someone want to</p>
<p>know they had your thyroid removed and</p>
<p>do they take synthetic hormones or can</p>
<p>they take something called desiccated</p>
<p>thyroid which most of the desiccated</p>
<p>thyroid compounds don&rsquo;t have hormones in</p>
<p>them they remove the hormones however</p>
<p>there are some extracts that do have</p>
<p>hormones natural hormones</p>
<p>doctors don&rsquo;t like to use them because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to regulate the thyroid</p>
<p>hormones because of the dosage they&rsquo;d</p>
<p>like the synthetic synthroid so they can</p>
<p>really keep things standard and I</p>
<p>understand that but what I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>recommend is you&rsquo;re gonna if you have a</p>
<p>thyroid removed you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>take hormones there&rsquo;s no other way</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no other part of your</p>
<p>body that makes this hormone so I kind</p>
<p>of like armored thyroid if you can find</p>
<p>it find a doctor that will regulate that</p>
<p>and do that because synthroid you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like t4 and your body has to</p>
<p>convert it there&rsquo;s no t3 and also it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>synthetic</p>
<p>I mean there&rsquo;s a lot of people that are</p>
<p>happy with that but there&rsquo;s someone to</p>
<p>bring up about this Karen as so many</p>
<p>people are taking thyroid medication but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not losing weight they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>seeing change so there&rsquo;s something else</p>
<p>going on and it could be the conversion</p>
<p>from t4 to t3 in which case the liver</p>
<p>and the gallbladder needs to be</p>
<p>supported with bile salts so yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just another point that you might want</p>
<p>to watch my videos on that alright good</p>
<p>you have another question Kerri yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a caller Cheryl from California</p>
<p>Cheryl from California is calling in yes</p>
<p>she was drinking v8 low sodium which</p>
<p>caused a lot of gastric distress okay</p>
<p>she was drinking v8 with no sodium</p>
<p>create a lot of digestive problems love</p>
<p>the electrolyte powder and is asking how</p>
<p>much is needed do you really need 4,500</p>
<p>a day if she&rsquo;s taking a thousand okay</p>
<p>she wants to know she&rsquo;s taking me</p>
<p>electrolyte powder and she wants to know</p>
<p>do we really need forty seven hundred</p>
<p>milligrams of potassium a day right so</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s taking about a thousand in the</p>
<p>electrolytes she gets about twenty six</p>
<p>hundred from food she&rsquo;s getting about</p>
<p>twenty six hundred from the food a</p>
<p>thousand from the powder should she</p>
<p>worry about magnesium toxicity from all</p>
<p>the supplements plus</p>
<p>should she worry about the magnesium</p>
<p>deficiency or toxicity well here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing if you&rsquo;re you don&rsquo;t have to prove</p>
<p>my electrolytes you don&rsquo;t to worry about</p>
<p>magnesium deficiency because I toxicity</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not giving you more than</p>
<p>the recommended amount that you need nor</p>
<p>will you have to worry about potassium</p>
<p>excess because it&rsquo;s 1/4 of what you need</p>
<p>so the combination of the electrolyte</p>
<p>powder and vegetables are gonna be just</p>
<p>fine unless you&rsquo;re taking some</p>
<p>additional magnesium which you can</p>
<p>probably get away with taking more and</p>
<p>not have any symptoms but because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really hard to become toxic with</p>
<p>magnesium what happens when you increase</p>
<p>my museum is you can start depleting</p>
<p>your calcium because they work together</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I like to always take a</p>
<p>blend of a lot of minerals but here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing with that when you</p>
<p>actually reduce the frequency of eating</p>
<p>and you eat less frequent guess what</p>
<p>that requirement of 4700 goes down maybe</p>
<p>to 3,000 because your body is in this</p>
<p>conservation mode and it doesn&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>the large amounts also you fix instant</p>
<p>resistance so you really absorb a lot</p>
<p>more than if you had insulin problems so</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re going to be fine</p>
<p>the reason if the people that need a lot</p>
<p>of potassium even more than I&rsquo;m what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>recommending are the cases that have</p>
<p>rheumatoid arthritis or they have heart</p>
<p>palpitations really bad or they have</p>
<p>atrial fibrillation where it&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>strong deficiency of this potassium and</p>
<p>then you just need a lot so again do the</p>
<p>best you can something is better than</p>
<p>nothing right Karen right so okay so</p>
<p>someone want to know is it normal to</p>
<p>have kidney pain a week into if&rsquo; well I</p>
<p>would really like to know where the pain</p>
<p>is because that so-called kidney pain</p>
<p>could be gallbladder pain but let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>is it normal no it&rsquo;s not normal so you</p>
<p>could be consuming too much fat</p>
<p>and that could be gallbladder or it</p>
<p>could be that you&rsquo;re not consuming</p>
<p>enough lemon juice so I would recommend</p>
<p>start increasing the lemon juice okay</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to counter any</p>
<p>potential for oxalate stone irritation</p>
<p>into your in your kidneys if that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>case</p>
<p>keep your vegetables high but maybe not</p>
<p>consume any spinach right now because</p>
<p>spinach has the highest oxalates and</p>
<p>that could in people that are</p>
<p>predisposed to getting kidney stones</p>
<p>create a problem but if you doing a lot</p>
<p>of lemon juice and you do potassium</p>
<p>citrate</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in my electrolyte powder but if you</p>
<p>do protection potassium citrate that</p>
<p>will also lower uric acid and uric acid</p>
<p>stones and counter the Oxus stone so you</p>
<p>got a lot to look out there and I would</p>
<p>watch my videos more on that but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the quick answer all right and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>staying to it Susan and Facebook has a</p>
<p>question yes she fasting for 15 hours</p>
<p>does the fasting for 15 hours yes and</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter what she eats she feels</p>
<p>extremely sleepy okay okay so what</p>
<p>happens when she breaks the fast and she</p>
<p>just starts eating she gets incredibly</p>
<p>sleepy and she&rsquo;s already taking and</p>
<p>several of my supplements and like blood</p>
<p>sugar formula so this tells me two</p>
<p>things well one of two things one is</p>
<p>that either her stomach needs more acid</p>
<p>in which case apple cider vinegar will</p>
<p>wake her up because if the food is not</p>
<p>fully broken down with hydrochloric acid</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;ll literally this undigested</p>
<p>protein will just bite put you out</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one case or the other other</p>
<p>situation is that you&rsquo;re still in that</p>
<p>transition phase where you have high</p>
<p>insulin and in insulin resistance in</p>
<p>which case that you&rsquo;re gonna have to go</p>
<p>longer with</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fasting okay go longer with your</p>
<p>fasting make sure that your protein is</p>
<p>not too high because that can put you</p>
<p>out make sure the carbs are low and then</p>
<p>just give it more time okay okay great</p>
<p>so we have on YouTube we have Maria he</p>
<p>is on YouTube yeah and this subject</p>
<p>comes up a lot what do you think about</p>
<p>not drinking any water during the</p>
<p>fasting this idea of a dry fest</p>
<p>okay so she asked about dry fasting not</p>
<p>drinking any water another good question</p>
<p>this comes up a lot dry fasting I can</p>
<p>just see this you&rsquo;re telling your</p>
<p>friends oh yeah go see dr. Berg</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna he&rsquo;s gonna tell you not to</p>
<p>eat eat a lot of fat and you know I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not gonna drink any water oh yeah I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna jump on that that sounds like a</p>
<p>great plan right it&rsquo;s a bit extreme</p>
<p>there is some data that shows that it</p>
<p>actually can help people but I am mixed</p>
<p>on it because the average person that</p>
<p>goes in a dry fast it doesn&rsquo;t like water</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably already low in minerals</p>
<p>and so now what happens is we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting a nutritional deficiency</p>
<p>symptoms problem if you go too long</p>
<p>without water because you need water to</p>
<p>kind of hydrate and actually mix with</p>
<p>the minerals especially if you&rsquo;re peeing</p>
<p>them out okay because when you&rsquo;re even</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fasting it&rsquo;s gonna be hard to go</p>
<p>24 hours without peeing</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re peeing all this liquid out you</p>
<p>have less fluid in the body you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>drinking any fluid in you&rsquo;re not taking</p>
<p>electrolytes and you&rsquo;re already</p>
<p>deficient a perfect combination to pass</p>
<p>out or faint so but if you&rsquo;re healthy</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing this a while and you</p>
<p>have a lot of minerals in already in</p>
<p>your body well go ahead and try it but</p>
<p>as far as my recommendation for the</p>
<p>average person I&rsquo;m not going to tell you</p>
<p>to do it there&rsquo;s a lot of things out</p>
<p>there that you&rsquo;re gonna see that that</p>
<p>people want to know is it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>help you like taking a cold shower for</p>
<p>example will stimulate your metabolism</p>
<p>well try to get the the general</p>
<p>population to take cold showers it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good it&rsquo;s like very painful but I will</p>
<p>say that when you put your body in a</p>
<p>stress mode whether it&rsquo;s high</p>
<p>intense exercise you know starting keto</p>
<p>without or we&rsquo;re in cutting off sugars</p>
<p>or going long long prison without eating</p>
<p>or all the stuff your body does respond</p>
<p>by adapting to the stress and in a</p>
<p>positive way so if there&rsquo;s something to</p>
<p>it but I don&rsquo;t think that you need to go</p>
<p>to that extreme that&rsquo;s just my opinion</p>
<p>how do you like that answer</p>
<p>Karen I like it I would tell people all</p>
<p>right okay thank you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the doctor&rsquo;s wife the doctor&rsquo;s wife</p>
<p>yeah okay so we have a Farrah from</p>
<p>Illinois is calling it Farrah from</p>
<p>Illinois is calling in mm-hmm</p>
<p>she just started you know and I have on</p>
<p>Monday okay start on Monday everything</p>
<p>was great for two days everything was</p>
<p>great for two days and she woke up on</p>
<p>Wednesday he could hardly move anymore</p>
<p>can she push past this okay I need a</p>
<p>little more data like when she says she</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t move is it because her joints are</p>
<p>sore or she&rsquo;s tired or what that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>is it stiffness because why don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>address the versions of food like</p>
<p>nothing has yes she she says she can no</p>
<p>food sounds good anymore after just two</p>
<p>days yeah well here&rsquo;s the thing I think</p>
<p>when some people everyone reacts</p>
<p>differently and it&rsquo;s why I recommend you</p>
<p>you jump it and just try it because some</p>
<p>people take longer chilled-out some</p>
<p>people adapt pretty fast where they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in fat burning and they&rsquo;re like wow I</p>
<p>have no interested in food whatsoever I</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t need to eat I&rsquo;m fine I feel</p>
<p>fine if you feel fine and you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the need to eat realize you are eating</p>
<p>you are eating your own fat and that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>fuel source that&rsquo;s very similar to food</p>
<p>and there are stored nutrients in the</p>
<p>fat like this specifically fat soluble</p>
<p>biden&rsquo;s so maybe what you would do is</p>
<p>ride the wave because I don&rsquo;t want you</p>
<p>to eat and feel sick so go ahead and</p>
<p>just keep going to the point where you</p>
<p>get hungry</p>
<p>but make sure you take nutrients okay</p>
<p>vitamins minerals things like that that</p>
<p>wait because that&rsquo;s the purpose of</p>
<p>eating Karen is to get your nutrition so</p>
<p>if you actually get your nutrition</p>
<p>without the calories but you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>the calories from the fat-burning thing</p>
<p>you might be okay in fact I think for</p>
<p>some people you know there&rsquo;s a guy that</p>
<p>fasted for over a year</p>
<p>not not long after year but about it</p>
<p>about it roughly about a year did need</p>
<p>for a year and he took vitamins and he</p>
<p>took nutrients and he lost I think he</p>
<p>lost close to over I think it was her</p>
<p>over 200 pounds yeah</p>
<p>yeah but he didn&rsquo;t eat any food so this</p>
<p>idea that you guys are gonna turn into a</p>
<p>skeleton or is I think it&rsquo;s go overrated</p>
<p>I think we could go for a long period of</p>
<p>time think about in the caveman times</p>
<p>how long would someone go without eating</p>
<p>would it be more than 24 hours and</p>
<p>afraid look at the guys on naked and</p>
<p>afraid</p>
<p>Karen that&rsquo;s a great point okay they</p>
<p>lose weight incredibly fast they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating a couple insects and maybe a fish</p>
<p>here and there but they&rsquo;re not eating so</p>
<p>but they couldn&rsquo;t go a year no because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s thin I&rsquo;m talking about a really</p>
<p>large person they can&rsquo;t go they can go</p>
<p>for a long period of time if you have</p>
<p>the reserve but the key Karen is to take</p>
<p>the nutrition okay your vitamins and</p>
<p>minerals that&rsquo;s what I would recommend</p>
<p>hey someone had a question about</p>
<p>cruciferous will that break the fast</p>
<p>oh no that&rsquo;s not the question well</p>
<p>cruciferous count towards your carbs no</p>
<p>none of the vegetables will count</p>
<p>towards the carbs so don&rsquo;t count those</p>
<p>in your net carbs or any carbs okay just</p>
<p>keep eating them and don&rsquo;t even factor</p>
<p>them in an equation other than to eat a</p>
<p>lot of them all right Karen so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>YouTube it&rsquo;s squirrel pass but wondering</p>
<p>if there is an age where gall bladder</p>
<p>issues are unusual so I mean I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know gallbladder issues aren&rsquo;t normal at</p>
<p>okay so someone that question is there</p>
<p>an age where it&rsquo;s just highly unusual so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of questions out there</p>
<p>that are very personal and might not be</p>
<p>common someone want to know is there an</p>
<p>age that gall bladder symptoms would not</p>
<p>be expected right maybe a child or no</p>
<p>actually you can have gall bladder</p>
<p>problems at any age actually okay any</p>
<p>age and that brings up another question</p>
<p>Karen and this question has to do with</p>
<p>the function of the appendix okay no and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing to do with the gall</p>
<p>bladder but since they&rsquo;re both little</p>
<p>little organs that are removed quite</p>
<p>common because it doesn&rsquo;t have they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a purpose I want to bring it</p>
<p>up Karen so appendix do you know what</p>
<p>the pen does care it&rsquo;s a lubricant it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lubricant okay it&rsquo;s not for anything</p>
<p>okay so good so I tell you what this is</p>
<p>our first question of the day probably</p>
<p>our only question today I want you guys</p>
<p>to see if you can tell me what the gall</p>
<p>bladder I&rsquo;m sorry what the what the</p>
<p>appendix does no googling okay no</p>
<p>googling to see what go ahead and type</p>
<p>it in there and then Karen you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>tell me what they find and what they say</p>
<p>okay so we got what is the appendix does</p>
<p>it have a purpose or not and what does</p>
<p>it do okay well don&rsquo;t tell me yet</p>
<p>journey all right why you&rsquo;re answering</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna continue on here can</p>
<p>type one diabetic Dookie toe okay so Kim</p>
<p>asked a question of Facebook can type</p>
<p>one diabetics dookied oh now I just want</p>
<p>to say something guys I have 3,000</p>
<p>videos and almost every question that</p>
<p>everyone always asked is on there so you</p>
<p>can also type dr. Berg and does diabetes</p>
<p>type one do they needed keto because</p>
<p>they do need to Duke you know in fact</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the only diet they should do there</p>
<p>is no other diet because think about it</p>
<p>diabetes</p>
<p>one means that your pancreas is no</p>
<p>longer producing insulin okay so that</p>
<p>means your sugar is gonna go screaming</p>
<p>high so the more car you eat though the</p>
<p>more insulin you&rsquo;re gonna have to take</p>
<p>the more times you eat the more I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry the more insulin that you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have to take and when you take more</p>
<p>insulin that actually creates more</p>
<p>damage than the high sugar so we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we want if you&rsquo;re diabetic type one we</p>
<p>want to take the minimum amount of</p>
<p>insulin possible and so we want to not</p>
<p>stimulate or actually we don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>release hardly any sugar in the system</p>
<p>if possible so we can take the least</p>
<p>amount of insulin that&rsquo;s what we want to</p>
<p>do and you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll be much healthier</p>
<p>in fact I believe and this is just my</p>
<p>opinion Karen that a lot of the damage</p>
<p>from type one yeah has to do with the</p>
<p>amount of insulin they&rsquo;re taking more</p>
<p>than the blood sugars now that&rsquo;s just my</p>
<p>opinion I could be wrong but probably</p>
<p>not yeah but I would definitely take a</p>
<p>lot of nutritional yeast to prevent the</p>
<p>damage also from the high sugar okay</p>
<p>okay good someone had a question about</p>
<p>lipitor in relationship to liver damage</p>
<p>lipitor is a statin and statins block</p>
<p>cholesterol we need cholesterol in the</p>
<p>body to make hormone sex hormones</p>
<p>estrogen testosterone so when you starve</p>
<p>the body of cholesterol because the body</p>
<p>makes it and it needs it what will</p>
<p>happen is that you&rsquo;ll starve off</p>
<p>testosterone if if you&rsquo;re a guy and have</p>
<p>those symptoms but then you&rsquo;ll have a</p>
<p>lot of muscle problems you need</p>
<p>testosterone to build muscle so then</p>
<p>what&rsquo;ll happen is you will have muscle</p>
<p>pain muscle loss muscle damage so yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s I do not like the cholesterol</p>
<p>medication at all but I&rsquo;m not a medical</p>
<p>doctor and I can&rsquo;t tell you not to take</p>
<p>it but what I can say is do some</p>
<p>research okay do some research and then</p>
<p>decide for yourself all right now Karen</p>
<p>I want to know what are we getting as</p>
<p>far as answers about my question what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the function of that little appendix guy</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>appendix helps digest stuff it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>digest appendix may be a good place for</p>
<p>good bacteria they hang out okay hold on</p>
<p>care so I know one could hear you no one</p>
<p>could hear you so I&rsquo;m I have to repeat</p>
<p>what do you hear me</p>
<p>No so because I&rsquo;m over here so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting a lot of random things so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just gonna tell you what it is and we</p>
<p>have a drum wall here okay so here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>answer here&rsquo;s the answer it is there to</p>
<p>act as a reservoir for friendly bacteria</p>
<p>in case you need to repopulate the large</p>
<p>intestine with good bacteria after</p>
<p>diarrhea or antibiotics so it&rsquo;s there as</p>
<p>a backup if you need to release a lot of</p>
<p>good bacteria it also is limp tissue</p>
<p>which also is related to developing</p>
<p>antibodies because you have the entire</p>
<p>gut Karen that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an immune organ</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like your first line of defense</p>
<p>against microbes so there&rsquo;s lymphatic</p>
<p>tissue and it does have something to do</p>
<p>with immune immunity okay I can&rsquo;t hear</p>
<p>Karen oh I can they can hear me just</p>
<p>fine what okay Wow thank you people this</p>
<p>is good this is gonna save me repeating</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s here I&rsquo;m repeating every questions</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like oh my god that&rsquo;s crazy all</p>
<p>right okay thank you</p>
<p>all right so my daughter has PCOS this</p>
<p>is from Denise Tara just started keto</p>
<p>will that eventually help with or just</p>
<p>kind of you lose it here okay well it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>will help with excessive hair already</p>
<p>there or just prevent it okay</p>
<p>so if you have PCOS you need to do keto</p>
<p>and a minute fasting it&rsquo;s gonna lower in</p>
<p>insulin which is then it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>lower antigens and its yeah it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>reverse it&rsquo;s gonna all the symptoms from</p>
<p>from high energy and will improve so yes</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see some huge changes and insulin</p>
<p>resistance in high insulin is not</p>
<p>associated with PCOS it causes it make</p>
<p>no all right Karen what do we got okay</p>
<p>so I have Robert on YouTube and he says</p>
<p>he has really high blood pressure and</p>
<p>what is a this looks like a typo but</p>
<p>some kind of natural substance he can</p>
<p>take or what you do oh this is the</p>
<p>no-brainer so if you have I finally have</p>
<p>an easy answer that can easily answer</p>
<p>with confidence blood pressure I had and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna answer it by telling you a</p>
<p>quick short little story of a guy who</p>
<p>just sent me this success to are saying</p>
<p>I I started taking potassium I think it</p>
<p>was sit right he was taking it blood</p>
<p>pressure went way down like within two</p>
<p>days goes to the doctor or I he&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>go to the doctor and he&rsquo;s like to ask</p>
<p>the doctor why didn&rsquo;t you recommend this</p>
<p>because high potassium relaxes the blood</p>
<p>vessels it&rsquo;s a physiological relaxer for</p>
<p>the blood vessels that helps elasticity</p>
<p>it brings the pressure down it improves</p>
<p>insulin resistance which which then will</p>
<p>lower insulin which is under behind the</p>
<p>high blood pressure because high levels</p>
<p>of insulin trigger the flight or fight</p>
<p>mechanism and also they cause sodium</p>
<p>retention so very very important</p>
<p>potassium potassium potassium to lower</p>
<p>blood pressure and then of course keto</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m in a fasting but that should do</p>
<p>it and you want to take little higher</p>
<p>amounts okay</p>
<p>yeah okay so what do we got Karen okay</p>
<p>so here&rsquo;s one person Karen on Facebook</p>
<p>is it knitting she is not on keto but</p>
<p>this is her scene she has internal</p>
<p>electric tremors shaking that you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see externally she&rsquo;s had it for about</p>
<p>two years she is not a Kido she is</p>
<p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s hypo thyroid and she says is</p>
<p>keto good for thyroid it appears to make</p>
<p>me more hypothyroid lower although she</p>
<p>says she&rsquo;s not on it so I&rsquo;m not totally</p>
<p>clear on that but take it away all right</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re getting a lot of or some</p>
<p>questions that are require a lot more</p>
<p>in-depth answer so I&rsquo;m going to kind of</p>
<p>give you the thumbnail sketch because I</p>
<p>could talk like a half hour about this</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like more in-depth it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>huge problem but there&rsquo;s a couple things</p>
<p>when you have these tremors that are you</p>
<p>can see them or you just feel them you</p>
<p>absolutely positively need to do keto</p>
<p>and in a minute fasting hardcore the</p>
<p>reason for that is because you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>regrow the nervous system you&rsquo;re good</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a neurological problem</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to regrow nerve cells and</p>
<p>brain tissue which is going to greatly</p>
<p>help any neurological problem including</p>
<p>the tremor or situation which is usually</p>
<p>coming from the brain the other thing</p>
<p>you need large quantities of is the B</p>
<p>vitamins you need to do a lot of like</p>
<p>nutritional yeast you can get them as</p>
<p>tablets but don&rsquo;t forget to when you do</p>
<p>key to make sure it&rsquo;s high-quality food</p>
<p>you know don&rsquo;t just try to do it for</p>
<p>like with low-quality stuff because um</p>
<p>you to build nerve tissue you it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whole package so that&rsquo;s what I would do</p>
<p>and I think that would help you greatly</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>you me yep okay</p>
<p>my dog there&rsquo;s a cop &rsquo;no kapoor on</p>
<p>youtube her daughter her his I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>has a minor phallus some new ballast</p>
<p>emia phallus see Mia will intermittent</p>
<p>fasting help yeah you&rsquo;re its condition</p>
<p>with the blood and the immune system and</p>
<p>what you have to do with the blood cells</p>
<p>and that you you need to do in a minute</p>
<p>fasting for sure and I&rsquo;m going to tell</p>
<p>you what&rsquo;s more important its</p>
<p>intermittent fasting that&rsquo;s way more</p>
<p>important because the in a minute</p>
<p>fasting is the thing that will build up</p>
<p>your immune system it builds up the</p>
<p>immune system to the point where a lot</p>
<p>of problems go away that you might not</p>
<p>even think is connected including</p>
<p>autoimmune weird symptoms that you</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know connected because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually putting the body into a state</p>
<p>of etapa G which it&rsquo;s recycling old</p>
<p>damaged parts and cleaning up microbes</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s the most important</p>
<p>thing that I would do as a quick answer</p>
<p>the next question has to do is high</p>
<p>pulse rate I have a high pulse rate what</p>
<p>is that that is either you have low</p>
<p>potassium or low B one so take make sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re including foods that have that</p>
<p>and your pulse rate should come down</p>
<p>okay all right</p>
<p>okay so we have Samira oh I just lost it</p>
<p>here from Belgium how does a number of</p>
<p>things going on but basically struggling</p>
<p>with indigestion for four years thinks</p>
<p>she has a parasite</p>
<p>she eats seventy percent raw she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Candida she can&rsquo;t get rid of she has h</p>
<p>pylori histamine reaction she&rsquo;s losing</p>
<p>weight but wants to gain weight and</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s describing strong digestive</p>
<p>enzymes help but she has to keep</p>
<p>increasing the dose all right and I</p>
<p>think you guys heard this so I just want</p>
<p>to tell you for this condition I would</p>
<p>go after first of all acidifying the</p>
<p>stomach the purpose of the acid in the</p>
<p>stomach one of the big purposes is to</p>
<p>kill parasites and microbes and viruses</p>
<p>that are coming into the food like if</p>
<p>you beat sushi raw meats or fish and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re usually loaded with micros just</p>
<p>FYI I&rsquo;m sorry to tell you that but your</p>
<p>stomach should kill it just like our dog</p>
<p>our dog couldn&rsquo;t drink out of the stream</p>
<p>and not have any problem because</p>
<p>Charlie&rsquo;s stomach is so acidic it kills</p>
<p>off everything so if your pH is too</p>
<p>alkaline you allow these microbes to go</p>
<p>in your stomach pH is too alkaline you</p>
<p>allow the microbes to live and survive</p>
<p>and innervate the lower part of the</p>
<p>system and that&rsquo;s how you start getting</p>
<p>all sorts of parasites and things in the</p>
<p>stomach the h pylori microbe lives in an</p>
<p>alkaline stomach in fact one of the</p>
<p>mechanism is it makes your stomach more</p>
<p>alkaline so just by keeping an acid you</p>
<p>can keep it in remission or get rid of</p>
<p>it because a lot of people have h pylori</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just in an inactive state becomes</p>
<p>active when your body becomes alkaline</p>
<p>so I would acidify that and then by</p>
<p>eating poorly and losing the stomach</p>
<p>acids over time</p>
<p>would you acidify it well that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s taking if I knew that would I be</p>
<p>seeing right here right now you too</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>you take betaine hydrochloride and you</p>
<p>need potassium to build the stomach</p>
<p>acids Karen you need potassium from</p>
<p>vegetables because the the little pump</p>
<p>that secretes hydrochloric acid in your</p>
<p>stomach is the potassium pump the worst</p>
<p>thing you could possibly do is to</p>
<p>consume a proton a proton inhibitor like</p>
<p>a like a anti-acid medication because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just going to take you from bad</p>
<p>to worse so I&rsquo;m just society know also</p>
<p>the other thing that we&rsquo;ll do is</p>
<p>antibiotics will screw up your pH as</p>
<p>well but yeah you need to certify and</p>
<p>then take like garlic and oregano to</p>
<p>kill off the microbes that are in there</p>
<p>black walnut hulls are good for</p>
<p>parasites if you have them and clove</p>
<p>okay all right good questions yeah all</p>
<p>right so one question someone wanted to</p>
<p>know what do you do for chronic lung</p>
<p>infections or lung congestion let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>you have asthma or some chronic</p>
<p>congested lung there&rsquo;s something that</p>
<p>works really good for this okay it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called cordyceps cordyceps it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>a it&rsquo;s a fungus that is in Tibet in the</p>
<p>high mountain range and this fungus has</p>
<p>a unique property of invading the</p>
<p>central nervous system and the brain of</p>
<p>the insects to survive and it starts</p>
<p>spreading well Chinese have been using</p>
<p>this cordyceps for ever for thousands of</p>
<p>years and what what it does is it</p>
<p>increases your oxygen carrying capacity</p>
<p>of the lung and it&rsquo;s great for</p>
<p>long-distance runners performance</p>
<p>helping people overcome things like</p>
<p>emphysema asthma and it&rsquo;s good for</p>
<p>vitality and its really good for adrenal</p>
<p>fatigue an adrenal burnout okay it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called cordyceps it&rsquo;s a fungus</p>
<p>and you can do some research on them</p>
<p>alright another question is can I</p>
<p>continue keto with no appendix or no</p>
<p>gallbladder Wow okay so yes you just</p>
<p>need to take a little purified bile</p>
<p>salts and you want to continue it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the thing that&rsquo;s gonna help</p>
<p>you greatly</p>
<p>can I take k2 without d3</p>
<p>yes but d3 actually helps work with k2</p>
<p>so what might be good you can take k2</p>
<p>with just and just get Sun and that</p>
<p>would be great I think that&rsquo;ll be fine</p>
<p>all right Karen yeah all right what are</p>
<p>the question do we have do we have this</p>
<p>quick question if not I can find one all</p>
<p>right how does keto help people that</p>
<p>seizures in a major way epilepsy</p>
<p>seizures are purely a blood sugar</p>
<p>problem you switched to running ketones</p>
<p>and the seizures go away just go do it</p>
<p>healthily alright good to hear Karen&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interactions thank you thank you all</p>
<p>right is there any help with nausea and</p>
<p>morning sickness yes that usually is the</p>
<p>gallbladder problem because what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening is that there&rsquo;s a change in</p>
<p>hormones and there&rsquo;s also pressure on</p>
<p>the gallbladder and there&rsquo;s a lotta less</p>
<p>space in there so I would recommend</p>
<p>consuming beets beet tops to help thin</p>
<p>the bile radishes are really really good</p>
<p>to thin the bile make sure you cut down</p>
<p>your fats a little bit and if the</p>
<p>gallbladder can flow normally the</p>
<p>nauseousness should go away in theory in</p>
<p>theory so go ahead and try that one more</p>
<p>thing okay you can also try activated</p>
<p>charcoal for nauseousness that tends to</p>
<p>work too if you needed something</p>
<p>go ahead Karen that&rsquo;s my final and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sticking to it</p>
<p>okay good so on you two</p>
<p>natalie is asking why does she always</p>
<p>wake up with a really fast heartbeat oh</p>
<p>I already answered that Karen today you</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t listening yes today hi Paul</p>
<p>straight yeah oh</p>
<p>pulse rate heart rate same thing okay</p>
<p>Natalie I hope your potassium and b1</p>
<p>potassium and b1 is the answer for that</p>
<p>and see you wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about</p>
<p>it that if you consumed enough</p>
<p>vegetables all right good questions guys</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>okay ed wants to know what about the red</p>
<p>rice yeast for lowering lowering</p>
<p>cholesterol I can talk the red red yeast</p>
<p>red rice let&rsquo;s readiness it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>say right exactly</p>
<p>okay so yes it is really good for</p>
<p>cholesterol in fact in some studies it</p>
<p>works even better than some of the</p>
<p>statins down there you just probably</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to take it together with the</p>
<p>statin but the point is if you want to</p>
<p>lower cholesterol I think I would</p>
<p>recommend red Reese the red rice red</p>
<p>rice yeast if you had a genetic problem</p>
<p>with cholesterol okay</p>
<p>but if you do Q doing in the fasting</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna need that at all fact</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I took it out of my one of my</p>
<p>products k2 and d3 and I put in there</p>
<p>some purified bile salts which is really</p>
<p>cool because one of the problems with</p>
<p>people digesting fats I love vitamins is</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have enough gallbladder</p>
<p>health in the bio so I put some pure</p>
<p>purified bile salts so when you take it</p>
<p>it goes in like a rocket ship</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the d3 in k2 so that&rsquo;s the live</p>
<p>recent change that I made okay so your</p>
<p>skin is a protein vegetables are protein</p>
<p>your body can create protein do you need</p>
<p>much dietary protein well here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing if you don&rsquo;t consume enough</p>
<p>protein if your protein deficient your</p>
<p>body will start going after your own</p>
<p>muscle proteins that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;ll do and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the problem there&rsquo;s not a lot of</p>
<p>protein there&rsquo;s not a complete profile</p>
<p>protein amino acid profile and salad</p>
<p>there is a lot of protein complete in</p>
<p>the full egg in different meats and fish</p>
<p>things like that and also you can get</p>
<p>some great protein from spirulina but</p>
<p>not necessarily from vegetables so if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t consume enough amino acids</p>
<p>over like four four days if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>consume enough amino acids your body</p>
<p>will start robbing your own muscle and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the problems of people end</p>
<p>up with like a muscle loss but on the</p>
<p>other hand</p>
<p>converted into</p>
<p>and into fat so make note of that cam I</p>
<p>made it okay good and there&rsquo;s a caller</p>
<p>who asks regarding keno and INF if the</p>
<p>if see there&rsquo;s the understanding that</p>
<p>the body isn&rsquo;t burning fat after a long</p>
<p>fast so their idea is the body isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>burning fat if you&rsquo;re fasting for more</p>
<p>than 22 hours is it burning muscle for</p>
<p>fuel</p>
<p>okay so after you do extend it fastest</p>
<p>fast will your body then start going</p>
<p>after the muscle it&rsquo;s gonna take three</p>
<p>to four days before it starts going</p>
<p>after your muscle because what will</p>
<p>happen is that the body will go into a</p>
<p>very conservative mode where growth</p>
<p>hormone spikes in a major way and growth</p>
<p>hormone is highly protective against</p>
<p>your muscle protein so in a minute</p>
<p>fasting it will spike growth hormone by</p>
<p>2,000 percent and men and thirteen</p>
<p>hundred percent women and on top of that</p>
<p>when you do at Apogee the body will</p>
<p>start recycling more proteins so the</p>
<p>need goes way down so I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna lose muscle if you do it</p>
<p>for even a couple days but when you get</p>
<p>into three or four days probably you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to start losing some muscle about</p>
<p>beans and protein that beans are good</p>
<p>protein yeah I&rsquo;m not gonna debate that</p>
<p>at this point I think just do your own</p>
<p>research if you find that it if it works</p>
<p>for you that gives you enough protein</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re happy with it go for it but beans</p>
<p>well the problem is the beans tend to be</p>
<p>high in carbs so we want to have lower</p>
<p>carbs am I saying that if you eat a</p>
<p>small amount of beans is that gonna bump</p>
<p>you out it really depends on your total</p>
<p>car so you know think with the</p>
<p>information make your own judgments on</p>
<p>that and see if it can help you I wanted</p>
<p>a question about can I do intimate</p>
<p>fasting with my regular diet well yeah</p>
<p>you can do it but just don&rsquo;t expect then</p>
<p>the great results that we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about because first of all when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>consuming the regular diet that means</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>some sugars and carbs right so what&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>happen it&rsquo;s gonna be hard for you to get</p>
<p>in the ketosis yes you&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>be eating and you probably think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably going to get into ketosis to</p>
<p>some degree but think about what ketosis</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s the it&rsquo;s the reduction of carbs</p>
<p>to the point where your body is forced</p>
<p>to burn ketones so if you&rsquo;re feeding it</p>
<p>carbs you might never get into a state</p>
<p>of ketosis where you see all the</p>
<p>benefits so I recommend you both but you</p>
<p>know that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m going to say about</p>
<p>that okay there are the next best source</p>
<p>would be sunflower seeds sunflower seeds</p>
<p>I noticed that yeah alright okay guys</p>
<p>have a lot of questions yeah does</p>
<p>toothpaste break your fast um no no it</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t break your fast unless you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>swallowing your toothpaste in large</p>
<p>quantities I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it now</p>
<p>now also this aligns with another</p>
<p>question will putting like facial creams</p>
<p>in your face break your fast no yeah</p>
<p>well why don&rsquo;t you tell them what you</p>
<p>did to me the other day well I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>do a video about it so I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>surprise them but I Karen is my guinea</p>
<p>pig she&rsquo;s a good sport she always lets</p>
<p>me do it&rsquo;s with weather supplements</p>
<p>she&rsquo;ll just like grab a handful take it</p>
<p>and not even ask me like what was that</p>
<p>and then recently we did a facial mask</p>
<p>with you know there&rsquo;s always coffee</p>
<p>ground extracts that you&rsquo;re rubbing on</p>
<p>your face with these facial which really</p>
<p>helps your skin I said wait a second</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s do a green coffee extract Karen</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s you can either grind the coffee</p>
<p>brains green</p>
<p>or we can buy the powder and then what</p>
<p>we could do is we could rub it on your</p>
<p>face and see what happens and it really</p>
<p>produces a nice complexion I was amazed</p>
<p>because you get all these phytonutrients</p>
<p>you get the caffeine in there on the</p>
<p>face it&rsquo;s not gonna absorb in the skin</p>
<p>so I will be sending a video out on that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a great I think it&rsquo;s better</p>
<p>than the ground stuff but you do have to</p>
<p>wash it off at least once a day</p>
<p>what are you daily must-haves okay so</p>
<p>well as far as eating goes I like my</p>
<p>eggs I like salad huge amounts of salad</p>
<p>I like olive oil high quality from Italy</p>
<p>virgin extra-virgin olive oil it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really good it actually just tastes</p>
<p>better and it&rsquo;s a lot better amazing</p>
<p>as far as supplements go the must-haves</p>
<p>are the electrolytes and the nutritional</p>
<p>yeast those two are the key with that</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s see do gym work to</p>
<p>double boost growth hormone and holistic</p>
<p>repair well yeah if you do intermittent</p>
<p>fasting when you workout and you do a</p>
<p>full-body workout you&rsquo;re gonna on top of</p>
<p>it a minute fasting oh my gosh if you</p>
<p>combine the ultimate workout which is</p>
<p>sprinting which is will release seven</p>
<p>hundred and seventy percent of your</p>
<p>growth hormone within a minute fasting</p>
<p>and drop your carbs all at the same time</p>
<p>and you get a good night rest you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>probably be looking about 20 years</p>
<p>younger very soon because it&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>anti-aging thing so here we go Karen&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gone guys</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s sprinting down the street</p>
<p>okay so you did other question Karen yes</p>
<p>I got several questions on Facebook</p>
<p>about hair loss I know you addressed</p>
<p>alopecia but regular hair loss on keto</p>
<p>yeah happening</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s usually a B vitamin deficiency</p>
<p>and if you take a look at for example</p>
<p>the number one remedy for hair is biotin</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the B vitamin so it it&rsquo;s when you</p>
<p>actually do keto and in the fasting your</p>
<p>cells utilize more B vitamins so if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re deficient going into it you could</p>
<p>actually suck out that last bit and then</p>
<p>it with hair loss so you need</p>
<p>nutritionally yeast okay</p>
<p>certainly used to prevent hair loss if</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t work then what you want to</p>
<p>do is you want to do the trace minerals</p>
<p>okay there&rsquo;s a great hair product that I</p>
<p>have it&rsquo;s called hair formula that has</p>
<p>nutritional yeast as the B vitamins has</p>
<p>the trace minerals and it has a type of</p>
<p>collagen that actually feeds the hair</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty powerful has a lot of great</p>
<p>reviews so you could try that as well</p>
<p>listen guys I want to thank you so much</p>
<p>for coping with this temporary patch up</p>
<p>thing we did we seem to make it work so</p>
<p>we will be back next week with a fixed</p>
<p>machine right Steve photobomb hey hey</p>
<p>come on now</p>
<p>alright thanks guys have a good one</p>
