    <p>Guys, my fucking dog in jail Joker&rsquo;s in jail. Joker got in</p>
<p>jail again. Okay, so he&rsquo;s been jailed in Italy. He was jailed</p>
<p>in Palo Alto. When will that dog learn? I&rsquo;ve spent quality</p>
<p>time with my dog. He&rsquo;s out of control. Why do you got jailed?</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s a runner. He went to he&rsquo;s a runner. He&rsquo;s a runner.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a track star. He uh the the we we we send him to like a</p>
<p>you know, like the dog walker where he goes and runs around</p>
<p>and they come pick him up but then they the guy opened the</p>
<p>door. He took off. Anyways, he gets found. They they&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to call me um because I guess my number is on the thing which</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t realized. You don&rsquo;t pick up? Can&rsquo;t reach me. Well,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in I&rsquo;m in DC in New York and uh they put them in the</p>
<p>kennel and we get this picture and Nick, you can post the</p>
<p>picture but you know, cuz I sent it to you. Poor poor Joker</p>
<p>and dog Joe. He&rsquo;s a great dog. The but he is he is. Wait, is</p>
<p>he back? Did you get out? He&rsquo;s back. We got him back but he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>back. He&rsquo;s out of jail again. Honestly, he&rsquo;s only gonna learn</p>
<p>if he goes to jail. You should get a little tag for him. Those</p>
<p>little uh remote tracking. Bro, that&rsquo;s not, I mean, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great but it doesn&rsquo;t stop him from escaping. That dog,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something wrong with that dog. Um remember when he</p>
<p>came over, when Saks came over? Yeah. And the dog was like</p>
<p>growling at him and Saks was like, not hunched in the</p>
<p>corner like. It&rsquo;s the only dog that doesn&rsquo;t like me. I mean,</p>
<p>every other dog, every other dog. What country was that dog</p>
<p>trained in? No, he&rsquo;s not been trained. He&rsquo;s not been trained.</p>
<p>We have to train him. I mean, I I I get it. He hasn&rsquo;t been</p>
<p>trained but he&rsquo;s so cute. Did you train that dog to hate</p>
<p>white people?</p>
<p>That dog is a little racist. I&rsquo;ll say it.</p>
<p>Rain Man David Saks.</p>
<p>And instead, we open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just</p>
<p>gone crazy with it. Love you guys. Queen of Kinhwa.</p>
<p>Alright, everybody. Welcome to another episode of All In.</p>
<p>The podcast that you&rsquo;ve been listening to for 48 episodes.</p>
<p>Here we are on the precipice of greatness. 49 episodes in with</p>
<p>us again today, the Queen of Kinhwa, your science ambassador</p>
<p>David Friedberg. Also on the pod, the Rain Man himself.</p>
<p>Definitely his dad lets him drive in the driveway. David</p>
<p>Saks and batting cleanup, the dictator himself Chamath</p>
<p>Polyhapitiya. What did we all think of last week&rsquo;s pod with</p>
<p>Bology? I felt it got cut off too soon. I was getting into a</p>
<p>groove with Bology and I&rsquo;m trying to figure out how to pick</p>
<p>that up with him because I thought that we were getting</p>
<p>into some pretty interesting discussion towards the end and</p>
<p>we obviously ran out of time. Chamath had to hop off. So it</p>
<p>would it would have been great to keep that conversation going</p>
<p>with Bology. I really do think there&rsquo;s a big question mark on</p>
<p>like, how does the decentralized centralized web or</p>
<p>decentralized social networks in particular work with respect</p>
<p>to kind of that, you know, recommendation application</p>
<p>layer, which is effectively what search solved on the</p>
<p>internet. And so I&rsquo;m curious to keep the conversation going and</p>
<p>seeing, you know, what this means. I made the decision to</p>
<p>end the pod because Chamath had to go, Saks had to go, there was</p>
<p>a hard stop. And I was like, I don&rsquo;t want to keep this going</p>
<p>without the other besties. And people were very upset. They</p>
<p>thought I shut it down abruptly, but we had a certain</p>
<p>amount of time and we can always have them back. So</p>
<p>everybody relax. But I did look at the stats. We each came in</p>
<p>with our, you know, whatever percent pro rata and he had</p>
<p>double so he had 40% and we all had basically. Which is right</p>
<p>for a guest, I think. I felt right. Didn&rsquo;t it feel right? I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s important to hear what when folks come on, what</p>
<p>they have to say. He&rsquo;s a really smart guy. And, you know, you</p>
<p>can kind of just let him go and riff for a while. And then just</p>
<p>react to him. So I think it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s lovely to hear such a deep</p>
<p>thinker. Think out loud, quite honestly.</p>
<p>Yeah. And even if you don&rsquo;t agree with him, I don&rsquo;t agree</p>
<p>with him on a lot of his points about, you know, decentralized</p>
<p>everything. I think centralized works for, you know, many things</p>
<p>better. I&rsquo;m curious, Saks, you know, looking back on it, were</p>
<p>there moments that you felt maybe you disagreed with him</p>
<p>more or agree with him more and wanted to lean into a</p>
<p>conversation? Obviously, it&rsquo;s very hard to have five people on</p>
<p>a pod and only get a certain amount of airtime, etc.</p>
<p>Well, look, I think, I think biology is a great guest to have</p>
<p>on once in a while. I mean, it does kind of turn the pod a</p>
<p>little bit more into a TED talk. Definitely have that vibe, but</p>
<p>the fans liked it. And I mean, biology should have his own show.</p>
<p>I mean, he can go for a while. I mean, he&rsquo;s got a lot to say for</p>
<p>hours. Yes. And he has, he has. And I think he should do his own</p>
<p>show because there&rsquo;s definitely a huge fan base for it. And, and</p>
<p>if people want more biology, I interviewed him for about an</p>
<p>hour on purple pills, which is kind of the, the, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if you want to call it solo pod solo show that I do where I</p>
<p>occasionally interview people on calling download call in and go</p>
<p>check out purple pills. So yeah, you know, I gave biology a</p>
<p>little pep talk coming in saying, Hey, listen, it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>roundtable discussion. And I&rsquo;ve interviewed before and you can</p>
<p>kind of tip into the monologuing and explaining very big picture</p>
<p>things. So just try to pass the ball a little bit here. And I</p>
<p>think he did adjust his game a little bit. But it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to have somebody like that on. I think you pointed out</p>
<p>sacks that it&rsquo;s more like a TED talk for him. We&rsquo;re having a</p>
<p>conversation and he&rsquo;s used to being interviewed. And I think</p>
<p>that is a that&rsquo;s a transition. But, you know, it was fine.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move on. Yeah. Okay. So I think we&rsquo;ll start off with</p>
<p>something we talked about on episode nine, which was coin</p>
<p>basis CEO Brian Armstrong wrote a very controversial blog, very,</p>
<p>very controversial blog post. Exactly a year ago, Coinbase is</p>
<p>a mission focused company. At the time, he was dealing with a</p>
<p>never ending debate inside his own company about Black Lives</p>
<p>Matter about social justice and any number of issues. And he</p>
<p>said, Listen, the company is mission focused, our mission is</p>
<p>to, you know, make people more financially independent,</p>
<p>literate, etc. And we&rsquo;re going to ban any discussions on our</p>
<p>electronic communications, you can do things on your own time.</p>
<p>And it was quite controversial. At the time, we had a good</p>
<p>discussion, I re listened to our discussion, I re listened to</p>
<p>our discussion on that pod. And we all universally felt like it</p>
<p>was the right move. Well, he went ahead and picked up the</p>
<p>hornet&rsquo;s nest. He did not have to talk about this ever again.</p>
<p>Everybody had forgotten about it. And he grabbed the hornet&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nest ran into the end zone and spiked it. Jason, can you Well,</p>
<p>before you do that, can you say how many people left as a result</p>
<p>of his blog post? And all of you know those stats? Because I</p>
<p>think I don&rsquo;t have those stats. But it was 5% ended up leaving.</p>
<p>There was a big article about it. This was I think I think it</p>
<p>was worth him doing a follow up post. This was the one year</p>
<p>anniversary of his blog post. And he was kind of giving us a</p>
<p>status update. And what he basically said is that the</p>
<p>policy had worked. So you got him. So first of all, should we</p>
<p>just review what the policy was? The policy was that they were</p>
<p>going to declare the workplace to be politically neutral that</p>
<p>people would leave their politics to the door, they would</p>
<p>not have sort of extraneous political conversations at work.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean you couldn&rsquo;t support whatever causes you</p>
<p>wanted on your own time or tweet whatever you want on your own</p>
<p>time. But while you&rsquo;re at work, they would declare it to be sort</p>
<p>of a political DMZ, like a demilitarized zone. Basically,</p>
<p>all he was doing was reasserting the old center, the old etiquette</p>
<p>of Hey, when you go to work, you you&rsquo;re not engaged in your</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re paid to work, you&rsquo;re not there to engage in</p>
<p>political activism. So that was the policy. And of course, the</p>
<p>woke mob became completely hysterical about it, as it</p>
<p>turns. And so then what happened is that Brian offered everyone a</p>
<p>very generous severance policy if they didn&rsquo;t want to stick</p>
<p>around for the policy. Yes, extremely generous. They made it</p>
<p>really easy, certainly done generous, right? They made it</p>
<p>really easy for people to check out if they want to check out</p>
<p>well, only 5% took the policy people. Yes. And then on the</p>
<p>heels of that, there was a gigantic New York Times hit</p>
<p>piece against the company, the usual disinformation and</p>
<p>slanders against the company. And then now we have this</p>
<p>follow up piece. And I think what Brian basically reported is</p>
<p>that today Coinbase is a more aligned company, because</p>
<p>everyone who&rsquo;s there wants to be there for the mission. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what they focus on when they go to work. He talked about how</p>
<p>they had hired top talent away from other companies. I mean,</p>
<p>basically, he put out the bat signal, and people came running</p>
<p>because, you know, we have, they wanted neutrality, they did not</p>
<p>want people are voting with their feet. They&rsquo;re fed up with</p>
<p>the politics and distraction. And and I think the employees</p>
<p>were secretly relieved that he declared this policy. Basically,</p>
<p>he took the heat on himself for the larger benefit of all the</p>
<p>employees who just wanted to be there and work and not have to</p>
<p>wonder whether they&rsquo;re doing something right or wrong,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re on the wrong side of a political issue.</p>
<p>freeberg nailed it when he said, in our episode nine,</p>
<p>which you go back to freeberg, you may not remember your</p>
<p>comments, but you said, What about the employees who just</p>
<p>want to come to work and don&rsquo;t want to engage in political</p>
<p>speech? Now you&rsquo;re infringing on them to force them to be</p>
<p>participate in these discussions. And they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a choice because they need to feed their families need to go</p>
<p>to work. And so freeberg, I think you&rsquo;ll take a little</p>
<p>victory lap there. He says in this tweet storm, I&rsquo;ll just read</p>
<p>the third part of it. One of the biggest concerns around our</p>
<p>stance was that it would impact our diversity numbers. Since my</p>
<p>post, we&rsquo;ve grown our headcount about 110%. doubled it, while</p>
<p>our diversity numbers have remained the same or even</p>
<p>improved in some metrics. So all of the hand wringing, and</p>
<p>pearl clutching that this would have a negative effect on the</p>
<p>company has turned out to be wrong. Go ahead, Chamath and</p>
<p>then freeberg. I mean, if you want, it&rsquo;s like, I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important to set the context for what this is, there is a</p>
<p>productivity war going on inside of institutions around the</p>
<p>world. And what&rsquo;s happening is that people&rsquo;s personal beliefs</p>
<p>are bumping up against what the mission and goals, operational</p>
<p>goals of a company are or a university or all these other</p>
<p>places. And so this is probably the first big example. This is</p>
<p>a what is a 50 $60 billion public company, $40 billion</p>
<p>public company that basically said enough&rsquo;s enough. This is</p>
<p>our mission, everybody else basically just needs to shut</p>
<p>the fuck up. And I think that that&rsquo;s very important. Now, if</p>
<p>they then go off and actually crush their goals, that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>one missing piece in all of this, because when that happens,</p>
<p>then you can write a through line through all of this and say,</p>
<p>okay, this is in part what allowed them to do it. So I</p>
<p>think that the the the folks that you know, were really up</p>
<p>in arms, still have one small straw in the fight, which is</p>
<p>that if these guys don&rsquo;t achieve their goals, they&rsquo;ll point to</p>
<p>this as one of the reasons why, but a whole diversity of</p>
<p>strength, or if you know, like, yeah, you&rsquo;re suppressing free</p>
<p>speech, you know, that argument. But I think if Brian then goes</p>
<p>and delivers a couple of knockout quarters in a couple of</p>
<p>knockout years, then, you know, what he will be able to say</p>
<p>definitively, which no one can refute is, we leave our politics</p>
<p>at the door, we define our okay, ours, and then we go and we</p>
<p>build things that people need as a company. And then you go</p>
<p>off and you can do whatever you want. And I think that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very powerful for many companies and institutions.</p>
<p>Friedberg, you heard my recap of what you said last, I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sure if you remember to re listen to what are your</p>
<p>thoughts today?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s worth just noting less about the</p>
<p>particularities of what was said in the particular issue at hand</p>
<p>here. And I would look more to kind of Brian&rsquo;s leadership style</p>
<p>as an excellent example of defining and creating strong</p>
<p>culture, culture in an organization can give that</p>
<p>organization what it needs to succeed, it puts everyone</p>
<p>aligned in a specific way on how we make decisions, how we</p>
<p>operate, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what his particular beliefs and</p>
<p>opinions or what to exclude what to include in the dialogue and</p>
<p>the discourse and the model for discourse within the</p>
<p>organization. I think what matters that he put a line in</p>
<p>the sand, and he said, this is what we&rsquo;re going to do, this is</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s in, and this is what&rsquo;s out. And organizations that do</p>
<p>that and do that effectively generally win, they win more,</p>
<p>they do better, the teams are aligned, the teams are more</p>
<p>unified. And I think that definition may sometimes be</p>
<p>controversial. And you&rsquo;ll notice that as companies get bigger, go</p>
<p>public, they&rsquo;re larger, they bring in professional managers,</p>
<p>and the founder or CEO steps out, they generally don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>that, right, they generally try to not do that definitional</p>
<p>work, because they&rsquo;re trying to minimize loss, and not kind of</p>
<p>take the bet on maximizing long term gain and doing the things</p>
<p>that they think culturally define, or will enable success</p>
<p>long term. So I think it&rsquo;s a great example of leadership</p>
<p>generally on how you kind of can, can be very vocal about</p>
<p>defining a strong culture.</p>
<p>Elon calls it I think Elon calls it corpo speak.</p>
<p>What happens, like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re meeting most companies, when they get bigger, they</p>
<p>gravitate towards corpo speak. And then what happens is some</p>
<p>cohort of employees who are really good, just feel trapped</p>
<p>in this kind of morass of mediocrity.</p>
<p>And by the way, look at Elon&rsquo;s, you know, call it attrition</p>
<p>rate, right? By the typical large scale public company</p>
<p>corporate metric of like, how many people are leaving per</p>
<p>year, you&rsquo;d say, Oh, my gosh, something&rsquo;s up with that</p>
<p>organization. But it really speaks to a strong culture.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a company that&rsquo;s famous for this called Bridgewater</p>
<p>Associates, you know, run by Ray Dalio $100 billion hedge fund,</p>
<p>one of the best performing investment vehicles of all time.</p>
<p>And they have incredible culture. I&rsquo;ve talked about Ray</p>
<p>Dalio&rsquo;s book principles before, and some of the work he&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>on this, where he is so adamant about getting culture right</p>
<p>within the organization, how you operate, that they almost</p>
<p>have, I think, a 30% attrition rate after the first year of</p>
<p>people that come in, because they not only try and screen</p>
<p>for these elements of what they consider to be the right</p>
<p>cultural fit for their organization up front, but then</p>
<p>they also screen people the heck out of the door if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not a good fit. And I think Elon has a similar sort of model.</p>
<p>And you know, I think Brian, the way he speaks about the</p>
<p>organization is a similar model. And it&rsquo;s about defining</p>
<p>the lines. It&rsquo;s about being very crystal clear about what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in and what&rsquo;s not, whatever, if you as a CEO, and a founder,</p>
<p>whatever you believe, you need to believe in it strongly. And</p>
<p>you need to communicate it clearly and then communicate it</p>
<p>and then let people vote. They vote with their feet. They don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get to vote whether to change it. They just get to vote</p>
<p>whether they get to stay or whether they go. And I think</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a really smart. I think that&rsquo;s well said. Yeah,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s one other issue here. Jake, Jake, how this goes</p>
<p>back to your point about why did Brian have to bring this back</p>
<p>up? Was it unnecessary? Did he spike the hornet&rsquo;s nest in the</p>
<p>end zone? Here&rsquo;s why I think it was necessary. If you go to</p>
<p>point seven and eight of his tweet storm, he says it was the</p>
<p>most positive reaction I&rsquo;ve gotten from any change I&rsquo;ve made</p>
<p>in the history of the company, which is saying something, how</p>
<p>could something be so negative in the press, but turn out to</p>
<p>be incredibly, incredibly positive with every stakeholder</p>
<p>95% of of employees privately, all the investors are telling</p>
<p>him it was a great thing. And then what he says is the only</p>
<p>sense I can make of it is there&rsquo;s a huge mismatch right</p>
<p>now between people stated and revealed preferences. And we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>operating in an environment of virtue signaling and fear of</p>
<p>speaking up. So to me, this is the point of this tweet storm</p>
<p>and bringing up now is without people like Brian standing up</p>
<p>and saying what the truth is that look, everybody wants this,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just afraid to articulate the principle that we</p>
<p>keep, we keep encouraging this climate of fear. And you know,</p>
<p>the alternative to Coinbase, you know, one of the other companies</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked about is Apple. I mean, you can basically choose</p>
<p>to be Coinbase or Apple, what has Apple done, they booted out</p>
<p>Antonio Garcia Martinez, because of a passage in his book that</p>
<p>they knew about. And ever since then, the company has been</p>
<p>roiled by boycotts and petition writing from the employees</p>
<p>about some new cause every couple of weeks,</p>
<p>and eventually that&rsquo;ll show up in the operating results of the</p>
<p>business. It&rsquo;s just a matter of time.</p>
<p>Right. And so so why does that go on? I mean, I&rsquo;m sure most</p>
<p>employees at Apple don&rsquo;t want to be, you know, constantly roiled</p>
<p>by these, like, petition campaigns. But they have to put</p>
<p>up with it, because everyone&rsquo;s so afraid to speak up. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s important that what Brian, do we have to basically</p>
<p>recognize that this woke mob who&rsquo;s cowed everyone to silence</p>
<p>is maybe 5% of these companies. And if everybody just acts like</p>
<p>Brian, the problem will be over.</p>
<p>Well, we know we know what the trail of breadcrumbs is right</p>
<p>now. And I think we should probably, you know, shine a</p>
<p>light on it, which is that that 5% is exactly the same as</p>
<p>Donald Trump, they just exist on the left, you know, and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an there&rsquo;s more and more research that shows that just as</p>
<p>much as we thought they were right, authoritarians, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>also left authoritarians. And this is what we&rsquo;re seeing that</p>
<p>that the craziness that you know, everybody decries on the</p>
<p>right, actually also exists on the left.</p>
<p>And they just put a button on that before we pivot to the</p>
<p>next story. Armstrong was very clear that the mission is about</p>
<p>global wealth inequality. So staying focused on that, in his</p>
<p>mind is the high order a bit and will result in the most great</p>
<p>change. So paradoxically, or ironically, you know, all these</p>
<p>woke people attacking Coinbase, Coinbase might do more for</p>
<p>wealth inequality, and justice in the world. If they stay</p>
<p>focused, then if they try to tackle everything, and you know,</p>
<p>this is a road to nowhere for Apple, I think sacks, you</p>
<p>pointed this out about how if you were running Apple, you</p>
<p>would fire anybody who does a petition, because I&rsquo;ll tell you</p>
<p>where Apple is about to basically land by enabling all</p>
<p>of this woke mob inside their own company by coddling them</p>
<p>addressing them and not keeping them focused, they will</p>
<p>eventually get to the fact that China is, you know, has 3</p>
<p>million Uyghurs in a concentration camp. And those</p>
<p>Uyghurs are proven to be providing through slave labor,</p>
<p>equipment and components to companies that eventually make</p>
<p>their way to Apple products. Ergo, Apple support slavery. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what the employees will eventually get to and that will</p>
<p>cause chaos.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something even closer, more closer to home</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s probably true, or could be true. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It is true.</p>
<p>But, you know, the fact that Apple had the most important</p>
<p>security leak in their entire software career, just a few</p>
<p>months ago, is also quite important. Like you had a</p>
<p>zero, why is it important?</p>
<p>You had a zero. So the iOS 14.8 exists because of why, because a</p>
<p>researcher or a set of researchers in Toronto discovered</p>
<p>that there was a zero click exploit in iOS that allowed you</p>
<p>to basically turn on the microphone, turn on the camera,</p>
<p>you know, grab anything you needed from iPhones, it was the</p>
<p>most secure device until two months ago, when it turned out</p>
<p>it was actually the most insecure device. So I tend to</p>
<p>think those kinds of technical mistakes happen when people take</p>
<p>their eye off the ball. And I think people take their eye off</p>
<p>the ball, because they&rsquo;re demoralized with dealing with</p>
<p>distractions.</p>
<p>Saks.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s the whether it&rsquo;s the Uyghurs or the</p>
<p>security issue, it&rsquo;s a good example of the employees at</p>
<p>Apple, see the spec in somebody else&rsquo;s eye, but not the log in</p>
<p>their own. I mean, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the principle. And, and</p>
<p>they would be much better off focusing on dealing with their</p>
<p>own internal issues. But but let&rsquo;s go, can we go back to that</p>
<p>article that Chamath referenced about?</p>
<p>Yeah. Anything you got anything else on this issue? Do you want</p>
<p>to before we segue over?</p>
<p>No, I thought this is a really great article. Do you want to</p>
<p>explain it? Jaco?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll just give you a quick overview. And then you can dive</p>
<p>right in since you put it on the docket psychiatrist and author</p>
<p>Satel, hopefully I&rsquo;m pressing that correct wrote an article</p>
<p>for the Atlantic entitled the experts somehow overlooked</p>
<p>authoritarians on the left. The main point here is that Trump&rsquo;s</p>
<p>presidency sparked a ton of research and coverage of</p>
<p>authoritarianism on the right, but mostly ignored the left with</p>
<p>some researchers even suggesting that the left wing, that wet</p>
<p>left wing authoritarianism isn&rsquo;t real. In an email to Satel, a</p>
<p>social psychologist from Rutgers said the following. For 70</p>
<p>years, the law, the law in the social sciences has been that</p>
<p>authoritarianism has been found exclusively on the political</p>
<p>right. Why is that one reason left wing authoritarian</p>
<p>authoritarianism barely showed up in social psychology research</p>
<p>is that most academic experts in the field are based at</p>
<p>institutions for prevailing attitudes are far to the left</p>
<p>of society as a whole sex.</p>
<p>Well, actually, Chamath put this on the docket. So Chamath, do</p>
<p>you want to introduce what you liked about it?</p>
<p>The reason I saw this, and I thought it was so interesting</p>
<p>was basically we had an entire body of research trying to</p>
<p>understand why some folks are attracted to these</p>
<p>authoritarian figures like Trump. And overwhelmingly, all</p>
<p>the research at the time said they only exist on the right.</p>
<p>And you know, you went and all of this started after Hitler.</p>
<p>And so there was all this research around the, you know,</p>
<p>social and attitudinal reactions to Hitler and how he came to</p>
<p>power and then all of the iterations of folks like him on</p>
<p>the right afterwards. And so people put Trump in that</p>
<p>category. And then they said, it can only exist there. But as</p>
<p>it turns out, when this person did this research, and she</p>
<p>surveyed 7000 people, and all of this data was very well</p>
<p>summarized in this Atlantic article, which I&rsquo;m sure we can</p>
<p>post in the show notes that folks should read. Lo and</p>
<p>behold, it actually exists on both sides. So as it turns out,</p>
<p>the extreme right and the extreme left are exactly the</p>
<p>same. They&rsquo;re moral absolutists. They believe in</p>
<p>themselves and themselves only. And they believe anybody else</p>
<p>that outside of where they are, is fundamentally in the wrong.</p>
<p>And if you actually look at that, and see how Trump behaved</p>
<p>in his presidency, and now how you see how the left names and</p>
<p>shames, you actually find a lot of commonality. So the reason I</p>
<p>found that article interesting is that it actually says, again,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;ve been saying, which is coming down the middle and</p>
<p>finding, you know, reasonable compromise is the only way</p>
<p>forward, because the minute you start moving in either</p>
<p>direction, you are the same. And that person is an ugly person</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t want around. Let me give the money quote, and</p>
<p>then get your feedback. Friedberg, the similarities in</p>
<p>the study included, quote, similarities between</p>
<p>authoritarianism on both sides, left and right, preference for</p>
<p>social uniformity, check prejudice toward different,</p>
<p>different others, willingness to wield group authority to</p>
<p>coerce behavior, cognitive rigidity, aggression and</p>
<p>punitiveness toward perceived enemies, outsize concern for</p>
<p>hierarchy. And, as Chamath pointed out, moral apple</p>
<p>absolutism, a free bird, I think, authoritarian figures</p>
<p>resolve when a population feels insecure. So I mean, we talked</p>
<p>about this last pod, but I do think that, you know, the</p>
<p>notion of freedom emerges after the comfort of security has</p>
<p>been provided. And I think the absence of security drives</p>
<p>people away from the drive towards freedom, like, when you</p>
<p>have a feeling of insecurity with respect to kind of your</p>
<p>ability to get a job, I mean, remember, Hitler rose to power,</p>
<p>when unemployment, you know, post Weimar Republic was</p>
<p>skyrocketing, people, you know, couldn&rsquo;t get jobs, they couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>afford food. And the authoritarian figure was going</p>
<p>to provide the security needed, I think, to resolve the concerns</p>
<p>that the population had. And then, you know, people latch on</p>
<p>to that. So, you know, there are moments in time when I think</p>
<p>authoritarianism can emerge with different forms of resolution,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that the authoritarian actor needs to</p>
<p>take a left or right point of view, they&rsquo;re just going to give</p>
<p>you a path to security, when you&rsquo;re feeling insecure, if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel insecure, you&rsquo;re going to say that&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>So countries that are wealthy countries that are privileged</p>
<p>with the opportunities that maybe the United States has are</p>
<p>less likely and less inclined to fall in, you know, in favor of</p>
<p>authoritarian leaders. And then as we slip backwards,</p>
<p>economically, unemployment wise, etc, we&rsquo;re more likely to be to</p>
<p>be in favor of those sorts of actors. And so I think that,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;ll see him emerge, but don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>that we actually didn&rsquo;t think it could exist in one end of the</p>
<p>political spectrum? And now it does you have a point in that or</p>
<p>no, I never really understood the whole, like, Hitler&rsquo;s purely</p>
<p>a right wing guy. Like, he was a, you know, a socialist, and he</p>
<p>was trying to enable, like, you know, socialized services and</p>
<p>socialized systems for people, you know, in a lot of political</p>
<p>circles, that would be argued as being a very kind of left point</p>
<p>of view. And so I don&rsquo;t know if it Yeah, I let&rsquo;s go beyond this</p>
<p>go beyond Hitler. But you&rsquo;re right, the the Nazi Party was a</p>
<p>National Socialist Party. That&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s what the name</p>
<p>of the party was. But there&rsquo;s also Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao, I</p>
<p>mean, if you&rsquo;re paying attention to history, you know, that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been authoritarianism on the left, not just the right.</p>
<p>And so but, you know, in the universities, and in the media,</p>
<p>they only want to focus on the right wing version of it. And I</p>
<p>think what the study does is it upends 70 years of dogma that,</p>
<p>that, you know, authoritarianism is only to be found on the</p>
<p>political right. I mean, it&rsquo;s obviously can be found on the</p>
<p>political left as well. And you can see that in cancel culture,</p>
<p>in speech restrictions, in these very aggressive COVID</p>
<p>mandates that are now happening. You can see it in the, the sort</p>
<p>of the, the ghoulishness, anytime somebody in the right,</p>
<p>you know, dies from COVID. I mean, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>some chortling on the part of the left about this, the harsh</p>
<p>penalties for non compliance. I mean, right now, rigidity is</p>
<p>the one that stands out for me, like, there is just on the left,</p>
<p>they make a decision, Amazon is bad. And they cannot move off</p>
<p>of that, right, David, like, what about what about willingness</p>
<p>to wield group authority to coerce behavior? And what about</p>
<p>aggression and punitiveness towards perceived and cancel</p>
<p>culture that would be that to me is it begs a good question,</p>
<p>which is what socialist regimes have come to power without an</p>
<p>authoritarian figure? Has there just none?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all revolutionaries, right? Actually, the study has a</p>
<p>really good point about this, which is they they say that the</p>
<p>researchers describe what they call the anti hierarchical</p>
<p>aggression. So one of the traits of authoritarianism is, is they</p>
<p>call it an outsized concern for hierarchy. But you know,</p>
<p>leftists think that they don&rsquo;t believe in hierarchy, but</p>
<p>actually, they do, they believe in an anti hierarchical</p>
<p>hierarchy, which is they want to turn upside down the social</p>
<p>hierarchy, and they&rsquo;re willing to justify that the ends justify</p>
<p>the means. In other words, if you can turn the hierarchy</p>
<p>upside down, they&rsquo;ll let you do anything. And it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>pretty scary. That&rsquo;s where the sort of the revolution comes</p>
<p>from. Here&rsquo;s a practical thing, jk about what you said, which</p>
<p>illustrates this point even further. Right now, we have a</p>
<p>three and a half trillion dollar bill, kind of meandering</p>
<p>through Congress. And, you know, it&rsquo;s very much a question</p>
<p>mark about whether it gets passed or not. And one of the</p>
<p>elements that&rsquo;s in there is free community college. Now, when it</p>
<p>passes, if it passes, there&rsquo;s a lot of support that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that the government should do, it&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re a private company like Amazon, who just announced</p>
<p>that they will give you free college, they&rsquo;re still a bad</p>
<p>company. And, and this is the example of this intellectual</p>
<p>rigidity that doesn&rsquo;t actually see the forest from the trees,</p>
<p>what do you really want? Do you want the process where you</p>
<p>control and you meter out progress? Or do you actually</p>
<p>want the outcome where somebody can get a job where they make</p>
<p>15 or $20 an hour, and also now get college paid for? Yes, I</p>
<p>personally want the latter. Yeah, we much better if the</p>
<p>government didn&rsquo;t have to provide. I&rsquo;d love I&rsquo;d love it</p>
<p>if the government could pay for it. But I&rsquo;m really glad that</p>
<p>Amazon is in a position to pay for it as well. But if you</p>
<p>start to become absolutist and say, Well, no, it just needs to</p>
<p>be top down and metered out this way. And any private</p>
<p>organization that wants to try to do it is still bad. I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where that rigidity holds us all back. It&rsquo;s unnecessary.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where I see the rigidity Chamath is, they keep saying gig</p>
<p>workers are bad. Nobody should be allowed to be a gig worker.</p>
<p>And David had a great interview with the ride sharing guy on</p>
<p>Colin, and in which they talked about the fact and this is</p>
<p>somebody who is super pro advocate of drivers said,</p>
<p>listen, 80% of people do not want to do shift work. They do</p>
<p>not want the government dictating how they work. And I</p>
<p>talked anecdotally with an Uber driver studies making like 70</p>
<p>bucks an hour. So during peak hours, they were fighting to get</p>
<p>minimum wage for drivers. Now drivers are making 20 3040 $50</p>
<p>an hour. Uber rides have gone and Lyft rides. It&rsquo;s a massive</p>
<p>competition free market works. Well, and they can&rsquo;t take the</p>
<p>win. They still are so rigid on the left that they&rsquo;re demanding</p>
<p>whatever that woman&rsquo;s name is, who is you know, in the pocket</p>
<p>of the arena Gonzalez, Lorena Gonzalez in the pocket of the</p>
<p>unions. How cynical are they? The victory is upon them. Yeah,</p>
<p>people are getting paid five times more three times more</p>
<p>minimum wage, and they still want to screw them. The takeaway</p>
<p>for a lot of people should be that your spidey senses should</p>
<p>go up when folks present solutions as a choice of one</p>
<p>source only. Ah, you know, when things when things can only</p>
<p>happen in one way, and it&rsquo;s the way that I feel the most</p>
<p>comfortable. Yeah, your spidey sensor should go up and you</p>
<p>should think to yourself really is that is that really the only</p>
<p>way like can&rsquo;t we have choice? Can&rsquo;t we have different ways of</p>
<p>solving this? Can&rsquo;t maybe we could run an experiment and see</p>
<p>what happens? Go ahead, sex? Well, I think your spidey sense</p>
<p>should also go up whenever somebody is basically saying</p>
<p>that speech needs to be censored for some higher purpose, you</p>
<p>know, that that that whenever people are trying to a bridge</p>
<p>and take away our rights, and our sort of long held values,</p>
<p>our freedoms, you have to start getting concerned. And there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always a reason why they want to do it. In the study, the quote</p>
<p>that the left wing authoritarians agreed with was</p>
<p>getting rid of inequality is more important than protecting</p>
<p>the so called right to free speech. So there&rsquo;s always some</p>
<p>higher reason the means always justify the the ends always</p>
<p>justify the means. But but that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what you have to</p>
<p>look out for is when they&rsquo;re taking away your right to</p>
<p>speech to another fun proof point. Fun because it&rsquo;s Dave</p>
<p>Chappelle that you can listen to or watch to see a flavor of</p>
<p>this left wing authoritarianism is called redemption song, which</p>
<p>is a little clip he put out recently. And the the entire</p>
<p>clip is more about him getting his body of work back from</p>
<p>Comedy Central. But the part in the beginning talks about</p>
<p>folks on the left that really tried to dunk on him when he got</p>
<p>COVID. And you should just listen to his reaction and how</p>
<p>he frames it. Because I think it&rsquo;s pretty powerful. And again,</p>
<p>it explains that extremism on both sides, they actually end up</p>
<p>looking the same. Yeah, aggression and punitiveness</p>
<p>towards perceived enemies. And I think that applies to anyone</p>
<p>who anyone who defies that, that whatever the conventional</p>
<p>wisdom is on COVID. There&rsquo;s another another example in the</p>
<p>study of that, that the people who the left wing</p>
<p>authoritarians agreed with the statement, I cannot imagine</p>
<p>myself becoming friends with a political conservative. So you</p>
<p>know, you&rsquo;ve got these social groups that are completely</p>
<p>uniform. And by the way, there&rsquo;ve been like studies for a</p>
<p>long time showing that liberals are twice as likely as</p>
<p>conservatives to be upset if their son or daughter were to</p>
<p>marry someone of the opposite party. So this has been a this</p>
<p>has been turned up in polls for a while, but this and you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen it on universities and college campuses, right? But</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this idea that you know, anybody of the other political</p>
<p>side is just suspect, you know, morally suspect needs to be</p>
<p>shunned, needs to be expelled. Like those are the people you</p>
<p>have to be concerned about. Yeah, you can&rsquo;t be friends. I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be friends with the USACs because you voted for Trump.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just ridiculous. No, but it&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>derangement to give the other side of this, I think Trump was</p>
<p>so extreme, and so trolling, and so great. I mean, if you</p>
<p>think about his superpower, it was to troll the left and put</p>
<p>them into such a deranged mindset, that they did actually</p>
<p>become that which they hated most.</p>
<p>Right. But he did, he did troll the left. But But here&rsquo;s, but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing is that we only hear in the media about the</p>
<p>authoritarianism of the Trump administration, how many times</p>
<p>were they screaming fascism during the Trump years, and, and</p>
<p>now today, and of course, you know, if you go to MSNBC, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>January 6, all day, all the time, that&rsquo;s all they want to</p>
<p>talk about. But you there&rsquo;s a total blind spot with respect to</p>
<p>the authoritarian tendencies of the left, which we see right now</p>
<p>in COVID policy. I mean, it is getting so extreme right now.</p>
<p>And I mean, Friedberg, you posted a breaking news that just</p>
<p>announced by a press conference, Gavin Newsom is now</p>
<p>implementing mandated COVID vaccines for all public K</p>
<p>through 12 schools in California starting this fall.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, these students?</p>
<p>Yeah. All eligible kids in all in all public schools, in all</p>
<p>public schools, in order to go to school in California, you</p>
<p>have to have a vaccine.</p>
<p>I mean, kindergarten, kindergarten.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, they&rsquo;re not eligible yet. If it&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re eligible.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re gonna be eligible very soon.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I, I, so, so we have a 13 year old and 11 year</p>
<p>old and a five year old, the 13 year old got vaccinated, she</p>
<p>wanted to, we supported it, the 11 year old wasn&rsquo;t eligible,</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t get a vaccine, she got COVID. For me, it was a</p>
<p>mild case. And our five year old isn&rsquo;t eligible for the vaccine,</p>
<p>he never got COVID. Now, if, if and when a new vaccine comes</p>
<p>out that our five year old is eligible, I don&rsquo;t think he</p>
<p>needs it. I mean, I&rsquo;m not anti-vax. I mean, I&rsquo;m glad I got</p>
<p>the vaccine. I&rsquo;m glad, you know,</p>
<p>Is he going to school?</p>
<p>My 13 year old got the vaccine. Yeah, he goes to school.</p>
<p>I guess the question is, do you, if it is safe, do you want</p>
<p>them going to school, catching it, spreading it? And do you</p>
<p>want them to not have to wear a mask?</p>
<p>How can you say conclusively, what&rsquo;s safe for a five or six</p>
<p>year old at this point in time?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little hard, their bodies are developing. And yeah,</p>
<p>you need some time.</p>
<p>I mean, do we really need to mandate this? I mean, why, why</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t parents make up their own decision?</p>
<p>Because of other people in society who would be impacted.</p>
<p>I mean, you also see this, you know, look, I think, I think</p>
<p>vaccines maybe are a complicated debate because vaccines do</p>
<p>actually provide protection. Let&rsquo;s talk about these mask</p>
<p>mandates, which I supported at the beginning of the pandemic</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all we had to fight it. But you take an example,</p>
<p>like San Francisco still has these stringent mask mandates.</p>
<p>The mayor of London Breed was caught out at dancing, singing</p>
<p>at a club, screaming, but in fairness to her, it was Tony,</p>
<p>Tony, Tony. I mean, yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s what she said was</p>
<p>her defense. She was like, she was basically like, it&rsquo;s Tony,</p>
<p>Tony, Tony guys. What do you want me to do? I&rsquo;ll risk the</p>
<p>COVID, which is I had to give her that one. If you want to</p>
<p>risk, if you want to risk to play poker or see your favorite</p>
<p>artist, I mean, I mean, what do you want to do? What do you</p>
<p>want her to do? Let me ask this question.</p>
<p>What she said when she got caught was actually correct,</p>
<p>which is we should be out supporting restaurants. We</p>
<p>should be out supporting nightlife. Adults should be able</p>
<p>to make their own decision about the risks they&rsquo;re willing to</p>
<p>take. The problem is she&rsquo;s not willing to give the rest of us</p>
<p>that choice, right? And we can all make our own choice. And by</p>
<p>the way, look, the idea that the COVID is not going to get</p>
<p>you. What you know, once you take off your mask, when you get</p>
<p>to the table, you know, we&rsquo;ve talked about this, right? Yeah,</p>
<p>you wear the mask and the meter D stand to the table, then you</p>
<p>take it off to eat and drink. And the COVID somehow not going</p>
<p>to get in. She was saying she was like, I listen, they were</p>
<p>like, you weren&rsquo;t eating, we have you on video, you weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>drinking. She&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s unrealistic for an adult to put</p>
<p>the mask on and off in between sips and bites. And I was on a</p>
<p>flight and I was flying coach as opposed to a business class</p>
<p>recently. And when I was in business class, I was eating and</p>
<p>drinking. There was no entire foreign language so far you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>speaking. What are you saying?</p>
<p>Most people pay for a plane ticket, and then they get on an</p>
<p>airplane.</p>
<p>So but the interesting thing was, when I was in business</p>
<p>class, I was eating my meal, I was drinking, no issues. I had</p>
<p>the mask off for whatever 20 minutes I was eating and</p>
<p>drinking. When I was in coach, same situation, the flight</p>
<p>attendant was going up and down the aisle. And while people</p>
<p>were eating and drinking, if they didn&rsquo;t have the mask on,</p>
<p>she was kind of being like a whole monitor saying please put</p>
<p>your mask on in between bites. And I was like, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah. And when we supported this mask mandate way at the</p>
<p>beginning of the vaccine, we all thought the government&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to distribute n 99 or at least n 95 high quality 3m</p>
<p>masks, right? We never got those. We never got it. I know</p>
<p>people people are like walking around wearing these cloth mat,</p>
<p>these loose fitting cloth masks. It&rsquo;s ridiculous. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>theater, the COVID goes, you know, through the bottom over</p>
<p>the top through the side, go right through it. I mean, like</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t do anything. And you&rsquo;re the Lone Ranger. Yeah.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that? Well, I mean, I look if you were a high quality,</p>
<p>like, you know, PPE type mask, I think it might be helpful. But</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s a marginal benefit once we have vaccines.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, just as we end this, what do we think of</p>
<p>Andrew Wiggins? Well, you can&rsquo;t comment on this, maybe because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re an owner on the team, but a number of NBA players,</p>
<p>high profile ones, in fact, in New York and California, where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not allowed in the arena if you&rsquo;re not vaccinated, are</p>
<p>now deciding to sit out their home games. So Kyrie Irving</p>
<p>being the highest profile one is refusing to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>And he will be getting paid. He&rsquo;s got a $200 million contract</p>
<p>max player. I think he gets $40-50 million a year. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to give up half of his salary to not $20 million a</p>
<p>year to not get the vaccine at least and leave his team to not</p>
<p>play with him in home games. What are our thoughts on</p>
<p>mandating NBA players who are playing inside an arena to be</p>
<p>vaccinated? Did you see Draymond&rsquo;s interview? I did.</p>
<p>What did what did Day Day have to say about this? He says that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s so **** strong, isn&rsquo;t he? Yeah, he was like, this is</p>
<p>ridiculous that we don&rsquo;t like respect each other&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>made this so political and it&rsquo;s all like antagonistic as</p>
<p>opposed to just meta recognizing that there are differences and</p>
<p>people have differences of opinion and respecting them and</p>
<p>embracing each other for those differences rather than like</p>
<p>attacking each other and finding fault in each other and</p>
<p>forcing them. And it&rsquo;s a great point. But I don&rsquo;t know. I mean,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that this point is any different than the point</p>
<p>about, you know, mandating a vaccine for anything, any</p>
<p>workplace, any school. I mean, if you&rsquo;re going to mandate if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to mandate vaccines for workplaces and</p>
<p>mandate vaccines for schools, you know, the NBA is going to,</p>
<p>you know, not be kind of excluded here. It&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>Right. Just happens to be a bigger paycheck and a higher</p>
<p>profile stage. I think as a matter of policy, the right</p>
<p>policy here is to let private employers decide whether they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to require vaccination or not. I think I think private</p>
<p>organizations have the right to do that. If you know, if a</p>
<p>restaurateur wants to say that we are going to be an all vax</p>
<p>restaurant, you want to, you know, they&rsquo;re only going to take</p>
<p>clientele who are vax, that should be their right to do it.</p>
<p>If another restaurant says we don&rsquo;t care, people can go to</p>
<p>that restaurant if they want. You know, I think that the free</p>
<p>market can sort of sort this out. I don&rsquo;t know that we need</p>
<p>the government imposing it. If the NBA decides this is what</p>
<p>they want to do. They can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it has decided what decision?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, what I wonder about is how necessary it is. I</p>
<p>mean, given the fact that, you know, all the players are young</p>
<p>and healthy. And if they want the vaccine, they can get the</p>
<p>vaccine. Look, I&rsquo;m really glad I got it. You know, I think it</p>
<p>but but I just, you know, if given that everybody is</p>
<p>vaccinated now who wants it, I just, you know, what is the</p>
<p>point of forcing that last 10% of holdouts to do something they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to do? I mean, this is where I think the</p>
<p>authoritarian I would resist the authoritarian impulse.</p>
<p>Friedberg, is there a new pill that&rsquo;s coming out? I saw a story</p>
<p>today about this. I don&rsquo;t know if I want to cover that or go to</p>
<p>unicorns. First, Merck published some results on this</p>
<p>basically antiviral pill, it effectively inhibits RNA</p>
<p>replication in viruses. And it&rsquo;s kind of, it was designed to be</p>
<p>kind of broadly applicable. It was, you know, discovered at</p>
<p>Emory University years ago, and they were testing it for</p>
<p>influenza. And then even priests pre COVID, they were testing it</p>
<p>on other kind of coronaviruses, SARS and MERS. And so the the</p>
<p>data that they just published shows that there&rsquo;s a 50%</p>
<p>reduction in hospitalizations 50% in hospitalizations, while</p>
<p>for people that are test positive for SARS, COV to</p>
<p>infection, and then they start the pill within some number of</p>
<p>hours, you take a few of these pills, I think they said five</p>
<p>days, right? Yeah, well, they did the test on like, it was</p>
<p>effectively Yeah, four or five days. That&rsquo;s right. When you end</p>
<p>up reducing the number, the percentage of people that end up</p>
<p>in the hospital by 50%. Now, you know, so the idea is that for</p>
<p>countries that don&rsquo;t have access to vaccines, you can very</p>
<p>cheaply make this chemistry, it&rsquo;s a cheap molecule that you</p>
<p>could theoretically produce at scale, and you could ship it all</p>
<p>over the world. And countries that don&rsquo;t have, you know, broad</p>
<p>scale vaccination programs, they can make these pills available</p>
<p>quickly and cheaply. And then, you know, as people get</p>
<p>infected with SARS, COV, two, they just pick up this pill, you</p>
<p>know, put it in every pharmacy, go grab a couple. And then the</p>
<p>hospitalization rate goes down. We don&rsquo;t yet know if it reduces</p>
<p>the transmission rate. So there&rsquo;s a lot of question marks</p>
<p>on like, does this actually solve the problem of the</p>
<p>pandemic? It&rsquo;s certainly another instrument to blunt the, you</p>
<p>know, the impact pronounce the name of it. It&rsquo;s mall new, all</p>
<p>new pair of your mall new pair of the government. And by the</p>
<p>way, there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of people in the study, no one that</p>
<p>took the pill died, people that didn&rsquo;t take the pill did die in</p>
<p>the in the infection in the infected population, because</p>
<p>they split them right, they gave some people a placebo and some</p>
<p>people the pill, the people that had the placebo, there were</p>
<p>deaths, no one in the group that had the pill, the actual pill</p>
<p>died. And so, you know, so theoretically, we don&rsquo;t yet have</p>
<p>enough data to know. But there&rsquo;s also a big question on the side</p>
<p>effects. Typically, these anti viral the RNA kind of blocking</p>
<p>drugs have other side effects. They&rsquo;re usually pretty mild. But</p>
<p>you know, so so there&rsquo;ll be a little bit more studying, but</p>
<p>generally, people view this as a super big positive. It&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>instrument, I&rsquo;m going to make a I&rsquo;m going to make a prediction.</p>
<p>Here we go. I think that the combination of vaccines and what</p>
<p>is equivalently Tamiflu for COVID, which is effectively what</p>
<p>this is, is the one to punch we need. So that this basically is</p>
<p>rendered, you&rsquo;re missing the three, you&rsquo;re missing a key</p>
<p>piece there, the testing, you must have testing to know that</p>
<p>you have this. But I think that that&rsquo;s a I think like the</p>
<p>testing is, it&rsquo;s not efficient, but the solutions exist. My</p>
<p>point is, if you have a combination of all these things,</p>
<p>this is like a flu, which means that there&rsquo;ll be less ability</p>
<p>for folks to not show up to work, which means that most of</p>
<p>the economy really will get back going. And I think then we</p>
<p>can get back to really addressing what are all that 10</p>
<p>or $12 trillion? How does it show up in the economy? That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where the inflation comes from. That&rsquo;s for all this other stuff.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m pretty excited by what I read today. But now my</p>
<p>mindset is going to 18 months from now, midterm inflation, I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s going to be what it&rsquo;s all about.</p>
<p>We ordered 1.7 million courses of this. I&rsquo;ll call it&rsquo;s a we</p>
<p>just call it basically, this is the equivalent of a z pack. So</p>
<p>I can call this the impact. If this hits, I&rsquo;ve taken probably</p>
<p>1.7 million z packs. That&rsquo;s just on the way back from Vegas.</p>
<p>So I mean, this feels like the endgame and they are going for</p>
<p>emergency use. So let&rsquo;s keep our fingers crossed. This would</p>
<p>mean the stock market&rsquo;s going to rip Jamal.</p>
<p>I know, I think the stock market is in a little bit of</p>
<p>precarious position, because if you have to, if you have to</p>
<p>reposition yourself, for inflation, there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>tech stocks that will get just absolutely obliterated. Like,</p>
<p>well, when you when you when you have inflation, so the the</p>
<p>order of operations, inflation means prices go up. The</p>
<p>government sees prices going up. And they say, how do we</p>
<p>control that they raise interest rates so that the cost of</p>
<p>borrowing goes up so that then less money is being spent,</p>
<p>right, so that we become a little bit more restrained.</p>
<p>When you do that, then all of a sudden, people have to think</p>
<p>about how much money you&rsquo;re going to make in the future.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re not investing as much in the future, you</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t make as much in the future. And when you discount</p>
<p>all those dollars back, there&rsquo;s less of them. And so all of a</p>
<p>sudden, you start to think about, oh, my gosh, well, I want</p>
<p>dollars today, not dollars 10 years from now. That really</p>
<p>puts a lot of pressure on tech stocks, because we trade on</p>
<p>multi year valuations in the future. So inflation is very</p>
<p>bad for technology stocks. Inflation tends to be good for</p>
<p>companies that make money today. Why? Because if I get $1</p>
<p>today, I can put it in this in the, you know, bond markets, or</p>
<p>I put it into a savings account, and I can get more interest</p>
<p>than I would have otherwise. And then separately, you also</p>
<p>want to own things that are physical and real, because</p>
<p>those have more value. So all of that has to then get worked</p>
<p>out into the economy, and we have to make a bunch of</p>
<p>economic decisions. So we so now the solution for that, in</p>
<p>all of those cases, though, is still if you&rsquo;re a hyper growth</p>
<p>company, you&rsquo;ll be okay. So if you&rsquo;re growing more than 50 60%</p>
<p>a year, you&rsquo;re fine. But if you&rsquo;re growing 20 or 30%, and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of a middling business, and rates are going</p>
<p>up, and inflation is going up, you&rsquo;re in a very, very, very</p>
<p>precarious spot. And snacks, what do you think?</p>
<p>Okay, well, I think there was, there was a great article in the</p>
<p>Wall Street Journal over the past week called university</p>
<p>endowment mint billions in the golden era of venture capital</p>
<p>is basically talking about I mean, these these university</p>
<p>endowments are like gaining 50% year over year, there&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>like nothing like it before. There&rsquo;s so many unicorns being</p>
<p>created. There&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a separate article in I think</p>
<p>pitch book as well about the rate of unicorn or crunch base.</p>
<p>Yeah, that the rate of unicorn creation, I think last year, it</p>
<p>was like one every few days. Now it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s more than one a day</p>
<p>bonkers. And so you know, we&rsquo;re getting multiple unicorns now</p>
<p>created every day this year, it&rsquo;s just this golden era VC,</p>
<p>this engine of wealth and prosperity creation. So that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the good news. And to connect this to a point we were talking</p>
<p>about earlier, if the radicals on the left would just allow the</p>
<p>golden goose to keep laying golden eggs, we&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>enough wealth and prosperity to pay for all these progressive</p>
<p>programs in the long run, but they&rsquo;re not willing to wait. And</p>
<p>so you have in Washington, for example, I think a political</p>
<p>program that really could upset the apple cart. I mean, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about a three and a half trillion dollar</p>
<p>reconciliation bill, it&rsquo;ll probably get brought down to</p>
<p>somewhere between one and a half and two, then you got a 1.2</p>
<p>billion trillion dollar infrastructure bill, they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>already spent 1.9 trillion on a COVID relief bill. This is after</p>
<p>the 6 trillion. What would you what would you advise should be</p>
<p>the amount spent? Well, okay, good question. So last year, the</p>
<p>federal government generated record tax receipts, the most</p>
<p>revenue it&rsquo;s ever raised, and it was about 19 and a half</p>
<p>percent of GDP. When Bill Clinton left office, he broasted</p>
<p>about the fact that government spending was only 18 and a half</p>
<p>percent of GDP. Last year, it was about 30% of GDP. My theory</p>
<p>on this is that if you have government spending as a share</p>
<p>of the economy at around 20%, from a tax and spending</p>
<p>standpoint, things basically work, okay. But as you try to go</p>
<p>up to 25 and 30%, it starts to break, you have too much</p>
<p>deficits and debt, too much money printing, too much</p>
<p>taxation, too much inflation, you become more brittle, and you</p>
<p>start to you basically are, you know, unhealthy, you&rsquo;re killing</p>
<p>the golden goose. And so, you know, all we have to do is let</p>
<p>the economy keep ripping. 20% of it is going to is going to be</p>
<p>government share. And you&rsquo;ll be able to fund more and more</p>
<p>progressive programs over time, as society gets richer. And by</p>
<p>the way, this, this prosperity that&rsquo;s being created in the tech</p>
<p>ecosystem, it&rsquo;s available to everybody who has a good idea. I</p>
<p>mean, this is not so as we all know, so it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>government that&rsquo;s creating advancement, and economic</p>
<p>opportunity for disadvantaged people, the tech economy is</p>
<p>creating it as well. And what I worry about is, is why are we</p>
<p>taking so much risk in upending this whole system that is</p>
<p>working quite well? Well, the other thing is, this is all in</p>
<p>the face of there being 11 million open jobs, there&rsquo;s 1.4</p>
<p>jobs for everybody who&rsquo;s unemployed. So the idea that in</p>
<p>some way, society is broken, and people can&rsquo;t be employed. Now,</p>
<p>these might not be there&rsquo;s only 4 million, there&rsquo;s only 4</p>
<p>million people looking for work. There&rsquo;s 11 million outstanding</p>
<p>jobs. Yeah. I mean, it is bonkers. Friedberg, or do you</p>
<p>think this is sustainable? What are your thoughts on spending</p>
<p>and turning over the apple cart as sex?</p>
<p>The longer you guys have me on this podcast, the more likely it</p>
<p>is you guys are going to unmask me as a diehard libertarian. I</p>
<p>will not let my tendencies, you know, come out in full force.</p>
<p>The spending is ridiculous, and there&rsquo;s a lot of waste. So I</p>
<p>mean, I&rsquo;ll just leave it at that. What I think is</p>
<p>interesting, though, is this unicorn creation system. This</p>
<p>unicorn creation machine, you know, it&rsquo;s worth highlighting,</p>
<p>because I think that that crunch base article show that</p>
<p>these unicorns in aggregate were worth like what one and a half</p>
<p>trillion dollars or something. And so those are all private</p>
<p>companies. $3.4 trillion.</p>
<p>Is that the amount of both bills?</p>
<p>3.4 trillion is the total market cap of all the private</p>
<p>unicorns, not just in the US, but at the world. And right now</p>
<p>in Washington, they&rsquo;re talking about three and a half trillion</p>
<p>dollar reconciliation bill, same size. Can you imagine</p>
<p>government spending, basically the entire value of the tech</p>
<p>ecosystem in one year? It&rsquo;s bonkers, right?</p>
<p>And so this, but by the way, I mean, like, I think that that</p>
<p>3.5 trillion, you can kind of think about that as being the</p>
<p>future economy of the future global economy, right? So the</p>
<p>entire I just pulled up the latest quarterly stat, but the</p>
<p>entire market cap of public US companies today stands at $47</p>
<p>trillion. The top 500 are about $38 trillion. So you know,</p>
<p>these private companies that are kind of the emerging tech</p>
<p>companies are, you know, call it 10%, or, you know, 8% of all</p>
<p>public today of all public companies today. And, you know,</p>
<p>it used to be the technology company started in Silicon</p>
<p>Valley, sold technology to traditional industries. What&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening in Silicon Valley today, and over the last 10</p>
<p>years or so, is that technology, quote, unquote, companies are</p>
<p>becoming the next industrial companies, they are replacing</p>
<p>profound insight. And so this is like what we saw, you know,</p>
<p>Airbnb is a hotel chain without hotels. Uber is, you know, a</p>
<p>transportation company without vehicles, DoorDash, DoorDash,</p>
<p>but but even more importantly, there&rsquo;s an entire emergent class</p>
<p>of life sciences companies of novel hardware companies. And</p>
<p>these businesses are leveraging their core technology</p>
<p>competence to create an advantage in replacing an old</p>
<p>model of doing industry, they&rsquo;re not selling into the old school</p>
<p>console. I think that the you know, and people are freaking</p>
<p>out about, you know, some of these big investors like Tiger</p>
<p>Global coming in and writing crazy checks. If you take an</p>
<p>index of the three and a half trillion dollars today and said,</p>
<p>you know what, these guys today are going to be worth more than</p>
<p>the $46 trillion market cap of all the other public companies</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it today, in the next 20 or 30 years, that&rsquo;s a pretty</p>
<p>good way to kind of place your money over a 30 year horizon,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go ahead and put as much money as I can into the</p>
<p>index of the private companies, and expect that they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be worth more than 46 trillion in 30 years, I&rsquo;m going to make a</p>
<p>10 bagger, that&rsquo;s a retirement fund for my family. And so it</p>
<p>makes a ton of sense, I think that these, you know, these</p>
<p>unicorns, given the advantages that are involved, you know,</p>
<p>kind of evolving from software and like sciences, and so on, do</p>
<p>end up kind of playing out, it&rsquo;s going to be ugly. And what</p>
<p>will happen is you&rsquo;ll end up seeing the asymmetry, you&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>the like, oh, my gosh, it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s 1000x, you</p>
<p>know, 100x return, it&rsquo;ll become $100 billion public company or</p>
<p>$200 billion public company. And then there&rsquo;ll be a bunch of</p>
<p>them, they&rsquo;re going to die. And people are going to focus on the</p>
<p>depths and say, this was overhyped, the bubble is over.</p>
<p>But the reality is the index of companies today, I would be</p>
<p>willing to bet 20 to 30 years from now is worth more than the</p>
<p>$46 trillion of all the companies.</p>
<p>So Chamath, one of the things we&rsquo;re seeing here, and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>playing a small part in it, or a large part, depending on who you</p>
<p>talk to. We now have over 6000 publicly traded companies on US</p>
<p>exchange, we have less than 4000, we have about 3800.</p>
<p>Okay, no, we had 3600 in 2016. According to the research I have</p>
<p>here, according to markets, watch 6000, publicly traded</p>
<p>companies in US exchanges. So what&rsquo;s the right number counting</p>
<p>the pink sheets and over the counter stuff, which is we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>seeing dramatically more publicly traded companies,</p>
<p>many speculative ones, or ones where you&rsquo;re getting to buy in</p>
<p>in year four, five or six, obviously, you&rsquo;re part of that</p>
<p>with, you know, all the different IPO A&rsquo;s through what</p>
<p>are you up to now? What&rsquo;s the Yeah, we have six tech specs, we</p>
<p>have four biotech specs, you know, I mean, I&rsquo;ve started or</p>
<p>invested in a bunch of others that have gone public.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at this through the lens of the public markets</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>My macro view is exactly what Friedberg said, we are much</p>
<p>better off with as many technology companies being</p>
<p>birthed and being viable. Because over the long arc of</p>
<p>time, those companies will rebuild things that are today</p>
<p>inefficient and broken in a better way. And the world</p>
<p>becomes better. The question is, for a lot of people, well,</p>
<p>what if the wealth isn&rsquo;t better, because it&rsquo;s only, you know, a</p>
<p>fraction of the number of people with a very specific skill set</p>
<p>that many other people don&rsquo;t have, that I think is a valid</p>
<p>argument. But then there&rsquo;s a different way to attack this</p>
<p>problem, which is you could actually do something really</p>
<p>meaningful around corporate interest rates and corporate</p>
<p>tax policy that would then get it. Right. So like, even if</p>
<p>those, those 1000 companies, if you assume that that $3.4</p>
<p>trillion 10 x is that&rsquo;s 34 trillion of eventual market cap,</p>
<p>right, that&rsquo;s going to be supported by trillions of</p>
<p>dollars of earnings. But maybe those things only have a million</p>
<p>or 2 million employees, but there&rsquo;s 8 billion eight, you</p>
<p>know, odd people in the world. Well, the way you get the money</p>
<p>into the government&rsquo;s coffers that they can reallocate it to</p>
<p>everybody that doesn&rsquo;t work at those 1000 companies is through</p>
<p>sensible tax policy that goes after the companies, because</p>
<p>those companies will still do the job, right? It&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to choose to not work at a, you know, world</p>
<p>beating startup in a mission that you care about, because of</p>
<p>the corporate tax rate. Nobody&rsquo;s going to do that. Right. So I</p>
<p>think this is where like, if you if you if you actually take a</p>
<p>step back and think of the bigger picture, the answer is</p>
<p>right in front of us, we just choose not to listen. This is</p>
<p>why you know, again, what Trump did was kind of stupid. You</p>
<p>know, he focused on corporate tax policy, cutting it</p>
<p>unnecessarily. And now what we&rsquo;re doing is we&rsquo;re fighting</p>
<p>over tax policy. And part of the reason why this bill isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>going to get passed is because of corporate tax policy and</p>
<p>trying to raise it again. But really, what we should do is</p>
<p>actually raise it leave personal rates roughly where they are,</p>
<p>you know, Elon even said, when asked by Kara Swisher this week,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, I pay 53% taxes. What about you? Yeah, it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to 57. And, you know, it&rsquo;s 53 5761. Who cares? Sure, whatever.</p>
<p>And he has to the point he made was listen, the pro publica</p>
<p>article was really disingenuous. They said he got a</p>
<p>tax refund. And they didn&rsquo;t, they never explained. Well,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because he overpaid his taxes massively the year before.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re selectively pulling information. And the fact is,</p>
<p>he said, I will be the first money into SpaceX and Tesla,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be the last money out. That is something we want more</p>
<p>founders to do, which is never sell their shares and be have</p>
<p>more skin in the game. So I I&rsquo;m sorry, I disagree with that. I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a bunch of fucking malarkey. Why? If you</p>
<p>choose to not sell, so be it. Okay. But look at the good that</p>
<p>Bill Gates has done by selling down Microsoft. So I mean, yeah,</p>
<p>that shouldn&rsquo;t exist. The Bill Gates Foundation shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist. No, no, no, no, the reproductive protect. It had to</p>
<p>be paid some he did that when he hits his 60 years old. I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>when you know other no, he started to do it when he was 40</p>
<p>years old, Jason. And he sold PayPal, and he was able to use</p>
<p>that money to reinvest in Tesla. I do think putting all the</p>
<p>money back into two companies that are solving two major</p>
<p>issues. He wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to do that if he hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sold in the first exactly my point is, let&rsquo;s not conflate the</p>
<p>problem. If you generate wealth, I think that you should be bound</p>
<p>morally bound by society to put the money back to work. He</p>
<p>chooses to put the money back to work by reinvesting so</p>
<p>aggressively into the things that he&rsquo;s doing. That&rsquo;s laudable.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s virtuous. Yeah, I agree. But it&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>only way Bill Gates took a different path, which is to</p>
<p>basically take all those profits, sell it down to then</p>
<p>be able to go and put it into the Gates Foundation. People</p>
<p>will take multiple paths. The point that&rsquo;s the same among all</p>
<p>these people is there&rsquo;s a moral obligation, they feel to do the</p>
<p>right thing for the future, then we&rsquo;re in agreement. So let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just celebrate that not some tactical thing about buying and</p>
<p>selling. By the way, one other point I&rsquo;d make them off like</p>
<p>you, you said that, you know, we should tax the the wealth</p>
<p>creation and distribute it. There&rsquo;s another way to get that</p>
<p>redistribution of wealth, which is to enable access to the</p>
<p>investments earlier, by public pension funds, by the</p>
<p>endowments by the places where people by the retirement funds,</p>
<p>where you know, a broader swath of the population, you know,</p>
<p>have savings sitting and change the accreditation. We&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>historically kind of forced the narrative that everyone in the</p>
<p>United States needs to have a home and have 80 90% of their</p>
<p>wealth tied up in a piece of real estate. And then we end up</p>
<p>with these massive kind of inflationary bubbles to keep</p>
<p>that value that book value kind of growing for them. The</p>
<p>reality is, if that money was put more productively into</p>
<p>building businesses, via retirement funds that had</p>
<p>access to venture capital, the public pension funds already do</p>
<p>but they should they probably under allocate to venture</p>
<p>capital today, relative to where they&rsquo;re putting. We talked</p>
<p>about the endowments are crushing and look at the</p>
<p>returns. Another way, by the way, if that was the model, you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t need to tax right? You</p>
<p>Well, by the way, one of the brilliant provisions in this</p>
<p>reconciliation bill is they&rsquo;re actually disallowing retirement</p>
<p>funds to invest in alternative assets, including startups and</p>
<p>and say venture capital insane.</p>
<p>That is so wrong. So wrong. Yeah. What? That&rsquo;s in there.</p>
<p>Taking pension funds and saying, you can&rsquo;t have access to them.</p>
<p>You as an individual through a 401k, or IRA, I cannot invest</p>
<p>in alternative rule, right? Yes, partly in response to that.</p>
<p>Well, they should just make it a cap. Don&rsquo;t you think they</p>
<p>should cap Peter teals? I think</p>
<p>why? Why cap anything? Who&rsquo;s this? Well, because it was</p>
<p>against the spirit of it. The spirit of the Roth was let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s discuss this as a specific issue. I&rsquo;ll tee it up</p>
<p>for you, Saks. Peter teal put his Facebook stock in his Roth.</p>
<p>And yeah, you&rsquo;re supposed to get that tax free. So you can have</p>
<p>a great retirement. He did that as an end run around paying</p>
<p>taxes on the Facebook investment that became worth billions of</p>
<p>dollars reportedly. So now they&rsquo;re saying you can have a</p>
<p>Roth, but anything above 50 billion, you got to pay tax on</p>
<p>because the goal here isn&rsquo;t for you to use it as a shelter</p>
<p>against some massive venture gains Saks.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a huge problem with them putting a cap on the</p>
<p>benefit of these accounts. However, my issue with what&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>the bill, there&rsquo;s a couple of issues. One is like we said,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re disallowing investments and alternatives, which I just</p>
<p>think is bad for savers. Why would you want to do that?</p>
<p>Second is the treatment of what happens when you exceed the cap.</p>
<p>And right now what they&rsquo;re saying is you have to</p>
<p>distribute out all of those funds and then subject them to</p>
<p>immediate taxation at ordinary income rates, which is</p>
<p>confiscatory because you could have made the investment outside</p>
<p>the retirement account and paid locked, long, long term.</p>
<p>If you do go over it should be yeah, long term tax, of course.</p>
<p>Yeah. And and furthermore, it&rsquo;s even worse than that. Because</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re saying is, let&rsquo;s say that you do have an</p>
<p>alternative, like an investment in a startup or a venture fund,</p>
<p>you have to distribute it out and pay tax on that, even though</p>
<p>that investment is not liquid, right? So you should be able to</p>
<p>take it out and just be treated normal cap gains and not have to</p>
<p>liquidate it. Do you think what it&rsquo;s going to do is, it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to get it&rsquo;s going to give people an incentive, it&rsquo;s going to warp</p>
<p>the incentives for saving, because what it&rsquo;s going to say</p>
<p>to people is you want to do well, but not too well, right?</p>
<p>Because if you hit the cap, you&rsquo;re now subject to a</p>
<p>confiscation, you get penalized. Yes, it should be. So it</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t be a penalty. Yeah, exactly. I think the way it</p>
<p>should work is you have a cap at any distribution above that,</p>
<p>you basically that becomes the basis for future taxation.</p>
<p>I think all of this can be summarized more simply, I think</p>
<p>that we have, unfortunately, gotten so confused, that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>decided to fix the finish line and stagger the starting line.</p>
<p>Right? Because all of this still doesn&rsquo;t apply to rich people.</p>
<p>No, this has been rich people, rich people can do all of these</p>
<p>different things. They can set up these out of state trust, they</p>
<p>can set up generation skipping trust, they can be, you know,</p>
<p>qualified investors, they can have QSPS deductions. And so</p>
<p>what this will do, unfortunately, is entrench the</p>
<p>kind of wealth gains that Peter Thiel was able to generate in a</p>
<p>very visible way that will just piss everybody off. And I think</p>
<p>instead, you got to go back to a different to a different litmus</p>
<p>test. So I, Jason, you have been the strongest advocate for</p>
<p>letting people participate in the economy. I have always</p>
<p>agreed with that we need to figure out how we can make sure</p>
<p>more important that it that it isn&rsquo;t abused. But that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>best ways to educate financial literacy so that they can</p>
<p>actually be a part of it. Even the starting line, let everybody</p>
<p>be able to put stuff into this stuff and learn about it.</p>
<p>I mean, what Peter did essentially was put lottery</p>
<p>tickets into his, you know, non tax retirement fund, lottery</p>
<p>tickets being buying stocks in private companies early, but</p>
<p>regular Americans aren&rsquo;t allowed to do that. So rather than</p>
<p>retroactively try to penalize Peter, because you disagree with</p>
<p>his politics, or because he did it too well. I think it&rsquo;s better</p>
<p>that everybody be allowed to be an accredited investor and do</p>
<p>what Peter did, which is, everybody should be able to take</p>
<p>their 401k or their Roth and be able to buy the next LinkedIn</p>
<p>Uber. So if you were a civilian, and you took an Uber, or you use</p>
<p>LinkedIn to hire somebody in year two, and you had an</p>
<p>opportunity to buy those shares, you should be allowed to buy it</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re a human resources person or Uber driver, and you</p>
<p>realize this is a great service that will change the world</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to figure that out. Freebird.</p>
<p>Yeah, look, I mean, the downside is you see speculative</p>
<p>concentrated bets that white people out. That&rsquo;s the reason</p>
<p>the protective provisions are in there. So I think there are</p>
<p>probably sensible ways of managing that, you know, around,</p>
<p>you know, qualifying, you know, pools of these investments in a</p>
<p>way creating indexes against them, etc. And maybe that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>right way to provide access, but you know, giving individuals</p>
<p>that maybe, you know, don&rsquo;t have the right kind of point of view</p>
<p>on a particular investment, the ability to put all of their</p>
<p>capital into that investment. Generally, I would say go for it.</p>
<p>The problem is we&rsquo;ve socialized, you know, protection, right? So</p>
<p>and this is the same with healthcare, in a model for</p>
<p>governing or model for a state where you provide socialized</p>
<p>care for people through healthcare, socialized</p>
<p>healthcare, or you provide socialized support for people</p>
<p>through, you know, the social security system and other</p>
<p>services like that. It&rsquo;s difficult to say, okay, the</p>
<p>government&rsquo;s going to be your backstop, and it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>provide the support for you. And we&rsquo;re also going to let you</p>
<p>take risky behavior. And that&rsquo;s where I think the two have to go</p>
<p>hand in hand. If you want to get rid of one, you got to get rid</p>
<p>of the other. And so because otherwise, we all end up paying</p>
<p>the cost of the person that takes the, you know, outsized</p>
<p>risk. And then we all end up having to foot the bill for that</p>
<p>person taking that risk. So if we&rsquo;re all going to be there to</p>
<p>protect that person, we have to tell them you can&rsquo;t take</p>
<p>unnecessary risk. Okay, hey,</p>
<p>Saks, let me ask you a conspiracy theory here.</p>
<p>Peter Thiel supported Trump when Trump was teetering on the</p>
<p>access Hollywood tape, and he went to bat for him, he gave him</p>
<p>a big donation at that time, then obviously did the</p>
<p>Republican National Convention, and was a key intellectual</p>
<p>influencer in his election plan. Now the Democrats are in,</p>
<p>and suddenly the focus becomes this one outsize Roth IRA, and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to rewrite the law so that Peter Thiel has to take</p>
<p>$5 billion or so is one of the estimates that I saw online on</p>
<p>CNBC out of his IRA. Do you think this is specific</p>
<p>vindictiveness on the part of the Democrats to try to attack</p>
<p>specifically Peter Thiel? I know he&rsquo;s your best</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I mean, it does feel and I&rsquo;m not I&rsquo;m not a Peter</p>
<p>Thiel apologist, but this feels vindictive and personal.</p>
<p>So yes and no. Okay. So what I would say is there have been</p>
<p>proposals over the last I think, going back to maybe even 2014</p>
<p>on providing some restrictions or caps on, you know, these</p>
<p>these IRAs and the Roth IRAs. However, there&rsquo;s never been a</p>
<p>proposal as punitive and retroactive and confiscatory.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing here. And specifically, it&rsquo;s the fact</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to force Peter to distribute out</p>
<p>everything above the cap, and then tax it as ordinary income.</p>
<p>I mean, that that&rsquo;s just changing the rules. That part,</p>
<p>I think, is directed at Peter, and I&rsquo;ve actually heard that</p>
<p>staffers on Capitol Hill are calling this the Peter Thiel</p>
<p>provision. So let me just confirm that part for you. So</p>
<p>what I would say is, I think there is a sensible way to</p>
<p>provide some restrictions on these retirement accounts, but</p>
<p>the way they&rsquo;re doing it is so punitive. I think it is</p>
<p>motivated by political revenge against Peter.</p>
<p>Chamath, what do we think of the number of unicorns being</p>
<p>created in the private markets? Obviously, when a company hits</p>
<p>unicorn status, I think they&rsquo;re going to start buzzing around</p>
<p>and maybe knocking on your door and SPACs and boards might</p>
<p>start thinking about that. These companies sometimes have</p>
<p>$10 million, $30 million in revenue, 50 million in revenue,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re becoming worth a billion dollars. Do these</p>
<p>valuations make sense writ large? And are you concerned</p>
<p>that this is a bubble?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a bubble.</p>
<p>Okay. Explain why there&rsquo;s not a bubble in early stage private</p>
<p>companies.</p>
<p>No, I think it&rsquo;s because of what we just talked about, which is</p>
<p>that these companies, by and large, are growing at incredibly</p>
<p>fast rates, and they are replacing legacy incumbents that</p>
<p>are growing very slowly or not at all. With and who have</p>
<p>basically won for a long time with inferior products. And so</p>
<p>as the superior products with more nimble organizations get</p>
<p>capitalized to go to market, they&rsquo;re just going to win. And</p>
<p>so I think what we&rsquo;re seeing is a wholesale replacement of the</p>
<p>economy, from the old to the new. And so that&rsquo;s why these</p>
<p>companies will do well. And I think it&rsquo;s going to be a really</p>
<p>powerful force in the world because like the world should be</p>
<p>a little bit more efficient and fairer when you have all this</p>
<p>modern technology working on your behalf. So I&rsquo;m a real</p>
<p>supporter of all of this, I think there&rsquo;s going to be even</p>
<p>more. And I think, you know, the the thing that we have to be</p>
<p>comfortable with is whenever something goes from a fringe</p>
<p>thing, which is what venture capital was, Jason, when all of</p>
<p>us were, you know, first in Silicon Valley 20 years ago, to</p>
<p>you know, today in 2021, we&rsquo;re sitting here, this is going to</p>
<p>become a fundamental part of the economy. And when that</p>
<p>happens, there&rsquo;ll be more and more money, the returns won&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>as good, that&rsquo;ll be okay, but there&rsquo;ll be a lot of progress.</p>
<p>And so you know, we&rsquo;re going through the same transition that</p>
<p>private equity did in the 80s and 90s, that venture that</p>
<p>hedge funds.</p>
<p>Did you see all the different venture capitalists who are</p>
<p>retiring, Bajan from Spark, the kid from Lightspeed, a bunch of</p>
<p>other folks, obviously our friend Bill Gurley is stepping</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s 50.</p>
<p>Am I doing something wrong here? I&rsquo;m like busy creating a</p>
<p>venture firm at age almost 50.</p>
<p>What do we think&rsquo;s behind this? They just made too much money</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Or is it because it&rsquo;s too competitive now?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re moving to Wyoming.</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s slightly different than this. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know. I don&rsquo;t know. I mean, I know all of those guys, but I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what their motivation is. But what I would say is I</p>
<p>tend to think that the mindset of venture has a relatively</p>
<p>short half life. And I think it&rsquo;s about 15 years.</p>
<p>And I think that there is a and because, you know, company</p>
<p>building is roughly a 10 year arc, you know, like when you</p>
<p>get into something early. And so I think that there is like a</p>
<p>newness whenever you start, I don&rsquo;t think it matters what your</p>
<p>age is. And then there is this sort of like death march that</p>
<p>sets in by year eight or nine. And then you try to see it</p>
<p>through to returning the capital and making sure all the</p>
<p>employees and founders you&rsquo;ve been invested with land the ship.</p>
<p>And I think what these guys did was get to that place and say,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;ve had this 15 year beautiful arc. Do I want to do</p>
<p>another 15 year arc? And for a lot of people, it won&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>much sense. And then also, I think your patience to do it</p>
<p>goes away. Right? Because it&rsquo;s like, you guys know what it is.</p>
<p>exhausting. It&rsquo;s exhausting. The amount of drama I&rsquo;m dealing</p>
<p>with right now in my portfolio is bonkers. The the the bet I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re seeing the sacks, but the amount of</p>
<p>shenanigans, bad behavior, fraud, lying, backstabbing is</p>
<p>at an all time. That would be your portfolio. JL. Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally three companies. I&rsquo;m literally dealing with three</p>
<p>companies with drama out of 350. I think it&rsquo;s one out of 100 is</p>
<p>probably fine. But I am seeing all kinds of shenanigans, even</p>
<p>in the diligence phase. I&rsquo;m seeing it.</p>
<p>I met something more tactical, which is like, for example,</p>
<p>you know, yesterday, we&rsquo;re starting something really</p>
<p>ambitious in batteries. And I have to sit there for an hour.</p>
<p>And we have to go through ordering the equipment, setting</p>
<p>up the lab getting human resource. And there&rsquo;s only so</p>
<p>much of that that you have the energy to do after a certain</p>
<p>amount of time, it&rsquo;s important work, you have to do it right.</p>
<p>But it feels a little low leverage. Now for that CEO, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>everything. And so you have to be on top of your game to help</p>
<p>that person. And I think this is where I appreciate their</p>
<p>honesty, in basically saying, guys, I don&rsquo;t have that level of</p>
<p>detailed focus in me anymore. And that&rsquo;s important, because</p>
<p>then a next generation of folks who want to put in that 15 year</p>
<p>journey, you need somebody committed, you need somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s super committed.</p>
<p>Yeah. And I do think there&rsquo;s a difference between being a</p>
<p>partner in a large partnership, where you kind of have your</p>
<p>portfolio of companies. And, you know, to Tomas point, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be on that arc with them. And then kind of building</p>
<p>a firm from scratch, where like, quite frankly, I would go crazy</p>
<p>the way that, you know, you&rsquo;re dealing with Jason and Chamath</p>
<p>is saying, I would get burned out if I didn&rsquo;t have a team.</p>
<p>So we now have like a pretty big team.</p>
<p>How many?</p>
<p>Well, just on the investment team, I think we&rsquo;ve got about</p>
<p>15 people. And, and then we now have a bunch of operating</p>
<p>partners. So, you know, we were looking at what Andreessen</p>
<p>Horowitz has done with services, you know, we had this big debate</p>
<p>in the venture community for a long time about whether venture</p>
<p>firms should operate, it should offer services and operating</p>
<p>partners. And Andreessen, you know, went hog wild with that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got like 200 people doing it. And I think they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>proven that it works in the sense I don&rsquo;t, you know, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not totally clear how much value they&rsquo;re delivering, but it</p>
<p>clearly works in the sense that founders would like the services</p>
<p>if they can get them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great marketing, but it may not be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great. It&rsquo;s great. It&rsquo;s great marketing.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re a great founder, when you were a great</p>
<p>founder, you wouldn&rsquo;t want Andreessen Horowitz telling you</p>
<p>how to run your HR and doing your marketing for you at</p>
<p>Yammer.</p>
<p>Right. But so what we&rsquo;ve done is what we&rsquo;ve done is focus on</p>
<p>bringing on not 200 people, but an expert in every functional</p>
<p>area that a SaaS company might need, because you do want access</p>
<p>to an expert. When you&rsquo;re setting up the department, you</p>
<p>want to go talk to the digital marketing person or the legal</p>
<p>person or, you know, or, you know, we have an executive</p>
<p>briefing center now. So we do believe that there is a version</p>
<p>of the services model that makes a lot of sense. And we are</p>
<p>building that if I had to do all of that value add myself, yeah,</p>
<p>I would, I would burn out.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, I think it&rsquo;s a very good point. I literally</p>
<p>last week launched the syndicate.com slash SaaS, a SaaS</p>
<p>syndicate, just for the same reason. So I can build a group</p>
<p>of individuals who are focused just on that and who have that</p>
<p>domain expertise. But they&rsquo;re the great founders do not want</p>
<p>you up in their business. So I I&rsquo;m concerned with like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we have like kind of we call it a teach them how to</p>
<p>fish model where we don&rsquo;t want to do the work. We want to give</p>
<p>them an expert as a resource who can meet with them, show them</p>
<p>show them some best practices.</p>
<p>Do you have people though coming to you expecting you to do the</p>
<p>work? Because that&rsquo;s what I know happens sometimes. Although</p>
<p>can you find us a developer? And I&rsquo;m like, no, but I can talk</p>
<p>to you about finding developers, but I don&rsquo;t have a recruiter on</p>
<p>staff. Do you have a recruiter?</p>
<p>Yeah, we actually do. Now we have three recruiters on staff.</p>
<p>So, um,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re paying a half million dollars a year to recruit for</p>
<p>your company. So that&rsquo;s a basically, basically, that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>big advantage. Is it working? Are you actually landing</p>
<p>developers?</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, look, we can&rsquo;t and I don&rsquo;t give a fuck about any of</p>
<p>this. Anyway, this is us in the weeds. So you want to talk about</p>
<p>some, okay, well, just a couple of a couple of it for a second.</p>
<p>I just want to go back to this like golden era point when we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about venture capital, because look, obviously, in the</p>
<p>weeds, we&rsquo;re going to talk about our problems. But I really</p>
<p>think that what&rsquo;s happening here with a thousand new unicorns</p>
<p>being minted every year is just unbelievable. If you look at the</p>
<p>number of billionaires in the U S I just Googled this. There were</p>
<p>614 billionaires in the U S as of October, 2020. Now there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably more, I don&rsquo;t know, let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s a thousand.</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re mincing a thousand new unicorns every year,</p>
<p>how many billionaires is that creating?</p>
<p>I mean, how many millionaires more importantly, how many</p>
<p>people who are making 50 to $250,000 a year before they</p>
<p>joined the ecosystem and now are worth millions will buy</p>
<p>homes, hire people start the next but let me just give you</p>
<p>guys the counterpoint to that, which I&rsquo;m not necessarily</p>
<p>arguing, but I&rsquo;m this is what I think the narrative is, which is</p>
<p>that those businesses that are kind of, you know, accumulating</p>
<p>wealth and accumulating revenue are effectively destroying the</p>
<p>old economy and shutting down companies and shutting and</p>
<p>destroying 11 million job openings. That&rsquo;s bullshit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s a zero sum game. Yeah, I</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s creative. It is disruptive,</p>
<p>right? So, there is a there is kind of a temporal flux and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a flux of people across from the old economy to the new</p>
<p>economy and it&rsquo;s that flux that I think creates the great</p>
<p>uncertainty and the great heartache that everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>trying to solve. That&rsquo;s the hand wringing. That&rsquo;s the hand</p>
<p>wringing. This is this is why it is so important to get</p>
<p>corporate taxation, right? Because if you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>replace GDP dollar for dollar, don&rsquo;t focus on the fewer</p>
<p>employees that work there. Focus on the largest number</p>
<p>possible, which is the revenue that these employees are</p>
<p>helping to generate for these companies. So, if you had much</p>
<p>much higher corporate taxation, you can play around with all</p>
<p>the personal taxation you want but if a lot of people do get</p>
<p>shut out of the economy, you&rsquo;re not going to make nearly as</p>
<p>much for the government as you would by taxing companies more.</p>
<p>Chamath, should there be a backstop? Because we know tax</p>
<p>law is so sophisticated and if you&rsquo;re intelligent, you could</p>
<p>make it seem like you didn&rsquo;t make any money because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>investing, you&rsquo;re distributing, yada yada. Should there just be</p>
<p>a Hey, listen, whatever you want to do with your taxes is</p>
<p>fine. But x percent of your top line revenue is your base tax.</p>
<p>And you cannot get around that. Should there be something like</p>
<p>that? There&rsquo;s a couple things that this tax bill attempted to</p>
<p>do, which could be really powerful if it does get passed.</p>
<p>I think that corporations should pay a large tax. I think</p>
<p>that they should be forced to spend a certain percentage on</p>
<p>R&amp;D. And I think they should be forced to spend a certain</p>
<p>percentage on basically benefits for their employees. And</p>
<p>I think that would do a lot to level the playing field. Then I</p>
<p>do think that you can have much higher individual taxation, but</p>
<p>you need to make it simpler because there&rsquo;s too many easy</p>
<p>ways like that ProPublica article showed for you to play</p>
<p>games for individuals to not pay taxes. And so you got to</p>
<p>simplify all of this stuff because it&rsquo;s too complicated. So</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re rich enough to hire a fleet of lawyers, you will work</p>
<p>all your way around it. Yes. Period. And they repealed it as</p>
<p>part of the EMT was for corporations was repealed as</p>
<p>part of the tax cuts and jobs act. I think I don&rsquo;t know where</p>
<p>that stands. But it does seem like a lot of companies because</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how that makes sense. J kal. I mean, like some</p>
<p>businesses run high margin, some are low margin, some are</p>
<p>losing money, some are over invested. I don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>solution. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m sort of saying. But one of the I</p>
<p>think one of the optics issues here is, you know, people are</p>
<p>like that company didn&rsquo;t pay any taxes. That company sells</p>
<p>this many iPhones, that company. Yes. Because they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing what tax laws were designed to do, which is to</p>
<p>encourage investment. So how do you fix it? Give me a solution</p>
<p>for your bird. I don&rsquo;t I think that once businesses are mature</p>
<p>and they start dividend in cash and making distributions and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re profitable, that might be the time to tax them. I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sure why would they ever do that if they had an army of</p>
<p>people saying, Hey, you don&rsquo;t have to, you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re investing in growth, they&rsquo;re creating jobs and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re growing the economy. And that&rsquo;s fine. I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re creating as many jobs as you think, but they are growing</p>
<p>the economy. That&rsquo;s why you have to tax the corporation because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the effective proxy for taxing GDP. Yeah, look, I would</p>
<p>be all about. I&rsquo;ll wear my libertarian hat again for a</p>
<p>second. But like, I would be all about taxation if I felt like</p>
<p>my dollars had a positive ROI where they ended up. And the</p>
<p>problem right now is like government spending is set up</p>
<p>in such a way that it&rsquo;s effectively been gamified and</p>
<p>people extract capital from the government. And my dollars are</p>
<p>not getting a positive ROI for me or for society. I would</p>
<p>rather have them sit which is why you left. Let&rsquo;s be honest.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you left San Francisco. I mean, it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re spending more. I left San Francisco. I&rsquo;ve got a family</p>
<p>and I and I need a backyard. So that&rsquo;s a little bit but isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>part of it that you are San Francisco, a separate degree of</p>
<p>incompetence, but like, but yes, you&rsquo;re right. They&rsquo;re spending</p>
<p>more than ever. And it&rsquo;s getting worse. San Francisco is</p>
<p>a whole nother a whole nother nightmare. Jake out. Well, like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just speaking in California writ large, in general, right</p>
<p>now, whether it&rsquo;s the state level or the federal level, it</p>
<p>feels to me, and I think it feels to a lot of people that</p>
<p>dollars aren&rsquo;t being spent in a way that&rsquo;s generating a return</p>
<p>for the taxpayer. And I think we all feel that way. And I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s frustrating. It&rsquo;s not about how much one&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>taxed. It&rsquo;s about how are those tax dollars being spent? And are</p>
<p>they being spent in a way that secures the future of our</p>
<p>nation of our people of our livelihoods, etc. And making,</p>
<p>you know, giving everyone access to opportunity, what&rsquo;s happened,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happened, what&rsquo;s happened is we&rsquo;ve created things like</p>
<p>student loan programs, and, you know, housing programs and</p>
<p>infrastructure programs that are literally just giving away</p>
<p>money to private companies that are profiteering off of</p>
<p>government spending, right. And it&rsquo;s as our favorite Professor</p>
<p>Scott Galloway says, it&rsquo;s one thing I really do agree with</p>
<p>politics, it is it is that there is this notion of crony</p>
<p>capitalism, where the United States and state governments,</p>
<p>even local governments as seen in San Francisco, California,</p>
<p>all the way up to the federal level, are spending money in a</p>
<p>way that I think we all feel is benefiting some</p>
<p>disproportionately to most. Now, if there was a high degree of</p>
<p>taxation, and everyone was benefited in a meaningful way,</p>
<p>and those programs were well managed, and capital flowed</p>
<p>meaningfully to, to support everything we want to support.</p>
<p>Great. I think everyone would raise their hand, raise two</p>
<p>hands and say, tax the heck out of me. Let&rsquo;s make that happen.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not what happens. And I think that&rsquo;s the primary</p>
<p>aversion to high taxation.</p>
<p>Sachs, you get the final word?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, look, I what I&rsquo;m worried about is taxes are going</p>
<p>up big time, no matter what happens in Washington, spending</p>
<p>is going up big time, we now have peacetime deficits that are</p>
<p>the biggest that they&rsquo;ve ever been, the deaths that the</p>
<p>national debt, the peacetime national debt, the highest</p>
<p>ever been, we have a looming debt crisis in China, we have</p>
<p>supply chain shortages. I mean, you know what, there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>things here that could upset the apple cart. And what I&rsquo;m afraid</p>
<p>of is we&rsquo;re going to look back at at this year, the 1000</p>
<p>unicorns being minted and say, that really was the golden era</p>
<p>and everything happened. And after that, we really screwed</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>You sound like the old guy at Starbucks that says that every</p>
<p>generation and complains about the last generation, golden era,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all down.</p>
<p>How much does music suck today?</p>
<p>Normally, normally, I will say how impressive it is that 10</p>
<p>years ago, none of those unicorns existed. And it is</p>
<p>likely the case that $3 trillion of value was created via private</p>
<p>funding and private companies over the last 10 years. So all</p>
<p>these entrepreneurs, all these employees, anyone working at</p>
<p>these businesses, anyone involved in these businesses</p>
<p>should be thrilled about the fact that you from zero created</p>
<p>three and a half trillion dollars of value in 10 years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s extraordinary.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not I&rsquo;m not I&rsquo;m not trying to create nostalgia about</p>
<p>the past. I&rsquo;m talking about the present and trying to preserve</p>
<p>it because I&rsquo;m seeing some storm clouds on the horizon.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would like to play the best song from Tony, Tony, Tony</p>
<p>is really Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, everybody, we&rsquo;re heading out this one&rsquo;s for you London</p>
<p>breed.</p>
<p>State state approved entertainment.</p>
<p>You can take off your mask for this entertainment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so good.</p>
<p>I need you guys watch a squid game.</p>
<p>Anybody watch squid game?</p>
<p>No, we have lives.</p>
<p>Nobody watched the game.</p>
<p>My kid, my kid&rsquo;s been talking about that.</p>
<p>Should I be letting them watch squid game or is it?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s the most violent Korean horror dystopian show ever</p>
<p>watched. They&rsquo;re going to be scarred for life.</p>
<p>Oh, I want to watch that.</p>
<p>Hey, sex as a follow up.</p>
<p>Did you, uh, did you watch the squid game?</p>
<p>As a follow up.</p>
<p>Did you, uh, did you stop your kids from, uh, from tick tock?</p>
<p>Did you take your kids off tick tock?</p>
<p>They told.</p>
<p>Yeah, I went in there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, kids, what are you watching?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you in a second.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So did you take your kids off tick tock?</p>
<p>Yeah, I went in there.</p>
<p>I was like, kids, what are you watching?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, dad, get the hell out of here.</p>
<p>Tell us our names.</p>
<p>And he was like, okay, I&rsquo;ll be right back.</p>
<p>If you can tell me to turn off tick tock by my name, I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s like, see you later.</p>
<p>The conversation was, what do you want?</p>
<p>I was watching on tick tock.</p>
<p>I hear it&rsquo;s all sex and drugs.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, no, we&rsquo;re watching dance videos.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, go ahead.</p>
<p>I trust you.</p>
<p>The dance videos are literally like.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Sex and drug-based every single one of them.</p>
<p>It is so deviant.</p>
<p>No, stop.</p>
<p>It is not that you&rsquo;re so exaggerating.</p>
<p>I am so not exaggerating.</p>
<p>Literally, if you listen, take the most obscene lyric to obscene hook to any rap song.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what trends.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so true, guys.</p>
<p>Every generation says the same about the next.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable, right?</p>
<p>No, but it is like explicit.</p>
<p>Listen, whatever.</p>
<p>I mean, like, you know, Pearl Jam and, you know, all the way back to the Beach Boys.</p>
<p>They said it about Elvis and shaking his hips.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I mean, no, this, when I say it&rsquo;s explicit, it is literally explicit.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t get the youth, Jekyll.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t understand them.</p>
<p>I think I understand it a little bit too well.</p>
<p>Anyway, you do not.</p>
<p>You see you.</p>
<p>Do you listen?</p>
<p>Oh, hey, guys.</p>
<p>Are we going to do the all in summit or not?</p>
<p>I went to the code conference and I was like, this was amazing to get back.</p>
<p>Jekyll, you got to stop talking about ideas and actually just doing them.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>We create a spot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to get buy in.</p>
<p>Jason, take a day to do it.</p>
<p>Go just do it.</p>
<p>OK, all right.</p>
<p>I need your buy in.</p>
<p>We have a voting system here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all in.</p>
<p>My name is Miami, Miami.</p>
<p>OK, first year, second year, Italy.</p>
<p>Not Rome.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do first year, Miami, second year, Italy.</p>
<p>Make it somewhat accessible.</p>
<p>I think we do domestic.</p>
<p>You have a cane, so you can&rsquo;t get there.</p>
<p>You old fucking bastard.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s going to work.</p>
<p>Two hundred fifty tickets, 200 for purchase, 50 for scholarship.</p>
<p>All in summit.</p>
<p>Three days, Miami.</p>
<p>Sax and I are off to the races.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you make it more people, bro?</p>
<p>Why do you have to keep it so exclusive?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just so exclusive.</p>
<p>I want to.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>I want to invert the top down hierarchy to what?</p>
<p>I want to be a left wing authoritarian.</p>
<p>What is it that I have to believe in?</p>
<p>That is what you are, a left wing authoritarian.</p>
<p>I just want to be rich and powerful.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what party I am.</p>
<p>I just want money, status and power.</p>
<p>Let me tell you.</p>
<p>Let me tell you why I like this idea is because to the points we&rsquo;re talking about with Coinbase</p>
<p>earlier, we you know, we have these conferences in the tech industry,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re frankly run by people who hate tech in the tech industry.</p>
<p>And people who are successful tickets.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>And so I see these tech founders going up on these stages and subjecting themselves</p>
<p>to these interrogations by people who hate them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, what are they doing?</p>
<p>Like, it makes no sense.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m putting up a form.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to let people take deposits.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to pick a month and we&rsquo;re going to go.</p>
<p>How many people went to the conference, guys?</p>
<p>You went to this week?</p>
<p>The code conference, I think was probably three or 400.</p>
<p>By design.</p>
<p>It was a third or half of the tickets.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t actually buy a ticket because I didn&rsquo;t want to be in the conference itself.</p>
<p>Because I was concerned about a breakthrough virus.</p>
<p>But I did host the poker game with Skye and Brooke.</p>
<p>Tickets, I think are 8000 for code.</p>
<p>And I think Ted is up to 10 or 15.</p>
<p>So how much are we charging me like $25,000,500,</p>
<p>7500.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re charging 7500.</p>
<p>And then 50 scholarships for people who wouldn&rsquo;t be able to afford it.</p>
<p>So the gross revenue here is we want 1.5 million.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s our cost going to be?</p>
<p>Cost will be a million.</p>
<p>And what so wait, so we&rsquo;re so we&rsquo;re making profit on this deal?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m making a profit.</p>
<p>We spend.</p>
<p>Let me be very clear.</p>
<p>We spend what we spend what we make.</p>
<p>I am buying the wine and you will shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>Okay, so then it&rsquo;s going to be it&rsquo;s going to cost 2 million.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to make 1.5.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>And if he&rsquo;s doing the wine.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s gonna go to me.</p>
<p>I want I want a wine budget so that everybody that comes is it feels like they&rsquo;ve had an</p>
<p>exceptional food and beverage experience.</p>
<p>So much is gonna spend half a million dollars on wine.</p>
<p>No joke.</p>
<p>So then it has to be 10k a ticket.</p>
<p>But you know what the people who are coming can afford it.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t take out we&rsquo;re not privileging you with some profiteering.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not profiteering off of it.</p>
<p>Honestly, the reason I want to do it most is I want to play poker for three days.</p>
<p>And I want to have us the four of us interview the most iconoclastic interesting people.</p>
<p>And I want to do it for the fans so that some number of fans get to come who wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>normally be able to come to a conference at this level.</p>
<p>And I just think it&rsquo;d be a blast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be fun to get together.</p>
<p>Okay, stop talking about it and do it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I just want to make sure everybody&rsquo;s bought in.</p>
<p>I mean, to get you fuckers on a date.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll set a date.</p>
<p>Okay, not not the first week of February, because I think I have a I&rsquo;m thinking March,</p>
<p>April, March, April.</p>
<p>Also, not the third week of February, because I think I&rsquo;m skiing in Europe.</p>
<p>Jesus fucking Christ.</p>
<p>Can you give us the dates you&rsquo;re not gallivanting around Europe and other places?</p>
<p>Bro, I&rsquo;m grinding every day here.</p>
<p>You see what I&rsquo;m doing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m fucking working hard to I mean, it&rsquo;s crazy right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ve never seen the market like this.</p>
<p>I mean, it is bonkers.</p>
<p>Enjoy it while it lasts.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Enjoy it while it lasts.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>All right, everybody, we&rsquo;ll see you next time for the dictator Chamath Palihapitiya</p>
<p>for the Rain Man David Sachs and the Queen of Quinoa.</p>
<p>David Friedberg.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jay Cow.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll see you on episode 55.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
