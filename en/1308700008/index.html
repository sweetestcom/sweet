Leanna&amp;rsquo;s case is one of those that once you&amp;rsquo;ve heard about it, you will never forget

    <p>Our card this week is Leanna Warner, the Ace of Hearts from Minnesota.</p>
<p>Leanna&rsquo;s case is one of those that once you&rsquo;ve heard about it, you will never forget</p>
<p>about it.</p>
<p>She was just five years old and not even two blocks away from her family&rsquo;s house when</p>
<p>she disappeared in the middle of the day.</p>
<p>The mystery has haunted Leanna&rsquo;s family and hometown for 18 years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>Saturday, June 14th, 2003 was a pretty typical summer day in the small town of Chisholm,</p>
<p>Minnesota.</p>
<p>Kaylin Warner and her five-year-old daughter Leanna spent the afternoon at a community-wide</p>
<p>yard sale in their neighborhood, just going from yard to yard buying stuff.</p>
<p>But by 4.30 in the afternoon, they had pulled into their driveway at home.</p>
<p>After she parked the car, Kaylin grabbed an armful of their rummage sale finds to take</p>
<p>and Leanna asked her mom if she could go over to the Quirks, a nearby family&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>to play.</p>
<p>You see, Leanna went to the Quirks almost every day because they had four young daughters</p>
<p>close to Leanna&rsquo;s age, and she loved to hang out with them.</p>
<p>At first, Kaylin said no, but Leanna begged.</p>
<p>And eventually, her mom relented and told her, fine, but you&rsquo;ve got one hour.</p>
<p>Be home by 5.30.</p>
<p>Leanna walking alone over to a neighbor&rsquo;s house by herself was not unusual, and anyone</p>
<p>who grew up in a tiny Midwest town might agree.</p>
<p>The walk took less than five minutes.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Chisholm Chief of Police Vernon Manor to explain just how short of a route Leanna</p>
<p>took that day through her family&rsquo;s quiet, relatively safe neighborhood.</p>
<p>She walked half a block to the west, a full block south, and then just a couple of doors</p>
<p>down across the street to this friend&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Chisholm&rsquo;s a small-knit community.</p>
<p>Everybody knows everybody, you know, around 5,000 people.</p>
<p>When 5.30 rolled around and Leanna hadn&rsquo;t returned home yet, Kaylin sent Leanna&rsquo;s</p>
<p>older sister over to the Quirks to retrieve her, but she returned within a few minutes</p>
<p>and told her mom that there was no one home at the Quirks.</p>
<p>That news was not what Kaylin expected or wanted to hear.</p>
<p>Immediately, she dropped what she was doing and went outside and started looking for Leanna.</p>
<p>At first, Kaylin figured Leanna was using a different route to walk home, or maybe she&rsquo;d</p>
<p>stopped at another neighbor&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Between 5.30 and 6.30, Kaylin knocked on every neighbor&rsquo;s door looking for Leanna, but</p>
<p>no one had seen her.</p>
<p>Now, at that point, Kaylin had not called police or even called her husband Chris to</p>
<p>tell him that his youngest daughter was missing.</p>
<p>Chris was at work for a local ambulance service, and she thought that calling either him or</p>
<p>police would be an overreaction because, truly, she believed any second her baby girl would</p>
<p>walk up and everything would be fine.</p>
<p>As she canvassed the neighborhood, some neighbors out of concern joined to help her search.</p>
<p>So many of Leanna&rsquo;s neighbors knew her, and specifically, they knew her by her nickname</p>
<p>Beaner.</p>
<p>This is how Vernon Manor described her.</p>
<p>Tomboy, plain as sand, very outgoing, not afraid to get dirty, not afraid to speak to</p>
<p>people, very, very friendly and outgoing.</p>
<p>So as people from the community walked around looking for her, they shouted,</p>
<p>Beaner and Leanna, but they got no reply.</p>
<p>By 7.30, Kaylin was growing really worried about Leanna, and she started to wonder if</p>
<p>her daughter had wandered into the woods and gotten lost, or worse, she knew there was</p>
<p>a lake nearby and maybe something had happened there.</p>
<p>At quarter till 8, Chris Warner returned home.</p>
<p>When he learned what was going on, he immediately joined the search for his daughter.</p>
<p>And finally, at 8.50, that&rsquo;s when the Warners finally called 911.</p>
<p>They went around, didn&rsquo;t call 911 right away because they, yeah, she&rsquo;s got to be somewhere</p>
<p>in a friend&rsquo;s house in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>So they went around for a little bit before panic started to set in that they hadn&rsquo;t found</p>
<p>her.</p>
<p>So they called 911 and our officers are first on scene.</p>
<p>Chisholm officers got there about 10 minutes later and immediately started searching for</p>
<p>Leanna.</p>
<p>They started inside the Warner home and worked their way out.</p>
<p>Though it was June in northern Minnesota, by 9 o&rsquo;clock there was only a sliver of</p>
<p>light left for emergency responders to work with.</p>
<p>So at 10.15, firefighters and scent dogs joined the efforts to try and find Leanna.</p>
<p>From the Warner house, the dogs tracked Leanna&rsquo;s scent to Longyear Lake, which was a popular</p>
<p>neighborhood lake just two blocks from the family&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same lake that Kaylin worried about just hours before.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing though, her scent being there didn&rsquo;t necessarily mean she went there</p>
<p>that day because her mom told authorities that Leanna had just been there on Friday</p>
<p>afternoon with her family.</p>
<p>So there was no telling when her scent was from.</p>
<p>The dogs also tracked Leanna&rsquo;s scent inside and outside of the Warner&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>No surprise there.</p>
<p>But what really surprised everyone was that the dogs did not pick up her scent at all</p>
<p>leading to the Cork&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>That made investigators think that she had never made it that far or at least never went</p>
<p>inside their home.</p>
<p>In those first few hours, searchers were trying to stay hopeful that maybe Leanna was just</p>
<p>scared or maybe hiding as a joke.</p>
<p>So one of the first places they did a more formal search of was the Warner property where</p>
<p>Leanna would have felt most comfortable.</p>
<p>Their house was searched, their garage was searched multiple times.</p>
<p>But besides the little girl&rsquo;s regular belongings and normal everyday things, there was no sign</p>
<p>of her.</p>
<p>Just when police were feeling like they were hitting a wall, they got some helpful information</p>
<p>after regrouping and establishing a timeline of everything they&rsquo;d learned so far after</p>
<p>canvassing the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Now up until this point, Kaylin thought that she had been the last person to see her daughter</p>
<p>when she walked off from their home that afternoon around 4.30.</p>
<p>But it turns out a few neighbors did lay eyes on her after that.</p>
<p>Two neighbors told police that they happened to be outside around 5.15 that day when Leanna</p>
<p>arrived at the Cork&rsquo;s front door.</p>
<p>That timeline left police puzzled since it shouldn&rsquo;t take anyone, not even a five-year-old,</p>
<p>45 minutes to walk a few blocks.</p>
<p>So they make note of the time gap and they conduct interviews.</p>
<p>The neighbors say they saw Leanna knock several times but never saw anyone answer the door.</p>
<p>The witnesses told police that they remember seeing Leanna sort of turn away when she realized</p>
<p>no one was home, but they didn&rsquo;t actually see her walk home.</p>
<p>Then after that, one more of the Cork&rsquo;s neighbors said that they saw Leanna walking down the sidewalk.</p>
<p>She knocks on the door, nobody answers.</p>
<p>She walks directly across the street where Wayne Crable is working on his vehicle&rsquo;s truck.</p>
<p>Wayne has a young black Lab in the yard and the dog is young and aggressive and jumps</p>
<p>on kids, so he&rsquo;s on a leash.</p>
<p>But as she&rsquo;s walking up, he walks up and grabs the dog to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t jump on Leanna</p>
<p>and then takes the dog and brings it back into the yard and change it up short.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the last person to actually ever see Leanna.</p>
<p>So given that information, police decide to search the Cork&rsquo;s house with their permission.</p>
<p>By the time the search for Leanna was in full swing, the Corks were home and explained to</p>
<p>authorities that earlier in the day they&rsquo;d been shopping at Target, which was in Virginia,</p>
<p>Minnesota, which is like 30 minutes east of Chisholm.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why they weren&rsquo;t home when Leanna had stopped by.</p>
<p>Authorities also searched Wayne Crable&rsquo;s house because he consented and was fully cooperative</p>
<p>with police.</p>
<p>Despite these two exhaustive searches, police found no trace of Leanna in either location.</p>
<p>Officers even went so far as to interview Wayne more closely, but he said his interaction</p>
<p>with Leanna was brief because he went back to working on his truck after putting his</p>
<p>dog in the backyard.</p>
<p>He said, I didn&rsquo;t see where she went from after that because I just went back to the</p>
<p>under the hood of my truck.</p>
<p>Did Leanna say anything to him?</p>
<p>Not that I recall.</p>
<p>There were dozens of people canvassing Leanna&rsquo;s neighborhood well after dark, but eventually</p>
<p>Kaylin, Chris, their friends and neighbors had to try and get some sleep.</p>
<p>As they retreated to their houses late on Saturday night, their hope was fading and</p>
<p>dread really started to creep in.</p>
<p>The Warners left their front porch light on in case Leanna wandered home in the middle</p>
<p>of the night, but she never did.</p>
<p>So it was overwhelming to the citizens and it was a numb feeling that something like</p>
<p>this could happen, just a disbelief.</p>
<p>And yeah, we had great turnout for people to volunteer, but there was also that buzz</p>
<p>of can you believe this is happening here?</p>
<p>A renewed search effort started at 4 a.m. Sunday.</p>
<p>The Minnesota State Patrol got an aerial search underway at first light from a helicopter</p>
<p>equipped with infrared technology.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension sent out a statewide alert and the Minnesota</p>
<p>Crime Alert Network faxed out information about Leanna to law enforcement agencies all</p>
<p>around the state.</p>
<p>The bulletin said that Leanna had brown hair cut into a bob and she was wearing just a</p>
<p>denim dress when she left her home that day.</p>
<p>She had left barefoot walking.</p>
<p>Not unusual for her to be barefoot.</p>
<p>Not unusual at all.</p>
<p>It was a fight always for her to put her shoes on.</p>
<p>An amber alert was not issued because at the time, law enforcement had no real evidence</p>
<p>that Leanna had been abducted.</p>
<p>I mean, that was definitely a thought on everyone&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>But in that moment, police did not have enough credible information yet to officially issue</p>
<p>the alert.</p>
<p>Police Chief Manor admits that behind closed doors, investigators were beginning to think</p>
<p>there was a criminal element to Leanna&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>With every passing day, our theory just grows on that.</p>
<p>So we prepare ourselves for the worst.</p>
<p>Police and search and rescue personnel did a more formal grid search Sunday after the</p>
<p>sun came up.</p>
<p>Again, starting inside the Warner home, working their way out.</p>
<p>We dove into the parents first.</p>
<p>You look at the last person who saw the person alive and the person who found them.</p>
<p>They had to be ruled out.</p>
<p>The parents obviously had to be ruled out.</p>
<p>There were a lot of rumors in the beginning that the parents did this.</p>
<p>All those were looked into.</p>
<p>Despite those types of rumors that swirl around a small town, Chief Manor said they eliminated</p>
<p>Leanna&rsquo;s parents of any wrongdoing pretty quickly because Chris had been at work and</p>
<p>Kaylin had not wavered from her original story.</p>
<p>On top of that, their concern for their missing daughter seemed genuine to police.</p>
<p>And then, the Warners told police something that made them wonder if a predator had been</p>
<p>lurking around Chisholm all summer.</p>
<p>The Warners told police that a few weeks before she&rsquo;d vanished, Leanna had come home with</p>
<p>a new case full of Barbies and Barbie clothes that didn&rsquo;t belong to her.</p>
<p>And when her parents asked her about it, she said that a little old lady had given them</p>
<p>to her.</p>
<p>And then one night, just before she vanished, Leanna packed a suitcase and said she was</p>
<p>going to go live with her new family at their house.</p>
<p>Chris and Kaylin said that on another occasion, they&rsquo;d found Leanna sleeping in her closet</p>
<p>because she said there were monsters outside her window.</p>
<p>Investigators took Chris and Kaylin&rsquo;s information about Leanna&rsquo;s odd behaviors seriously, but</p>
<p>they also had to consider the fact that Leanna was a five-year-old with a vivid imagination.</p>
<p>But you have to wonder&hellip;</p>
<p>Is there any chance someone was grooming her to trust them?</p>
<p>There is.</p>
<p>Obviously, those comments are very alarming to us.</p>
<p>So did she make that up?</p>
<p>Or did she say it was somebody grooming her?</p>
<p>You know, we had the Barbie doll case that showed up.</p>
<p>It was a pink plastic Barbie doll case with some miscellaneous toys and stuff in there.</p>
<p>That showed up.</p>
<p>They had no idea where she got that from.</p>
<p>They figured she stole it from one of her friends.</p>
<p>Chief Manor said that they kept the information in mind as they continued investigating and</p>
<p>took the Barbie case as evidence.</p>
<p>But beyond that, there wasn&rsquo;t much they could do with the lead.</p>
<p>It was tough to corroborate and, at the time, felt like a dead end.</p>
<p>In 2003, Vernon Manor was a Lieutenant Investigator with the Chisholm Police Department.</p>
<p>The weekend Leanna went missing is etched into his memory forever.</p>
<p>He had been out of town when the 911 call came in that Saturday, so on Sunday, when</p>
<p>he was back in the area and Leanna had still not been found, he was called in to help with</p>
<p>the investigation.</p>
<p>He went straight to the Warners&rsquo; home and told her mom, Kalen, that she needed to stay</p>
<p>there in case Leanna came home.</p>
<p>St. Louis County deputies joined the efforts, and state agents also started to trickle in</p>
<p>to help.</p>
<p>Chisholm is in a big iron mining area, so searchers took to wells and abandoned mine</p>
<p>shafts using cameras and infrared technology.</p>
<p>Police set up a command post at an elementary school in town to make sure an organized system</p>
<p>was in place to keep track of what tips were coming in, what search areas had been covered,</p>
<p>and who had been interviewed.</p>
<p>But despite all of this work and coordination, another full day went by with no sign of Leanna.</p>
<p>This really rocked, rocked the town, and everybody kind of held on, especially that</p>
<p>summer held on.</p>
<p>Your kids are a little tighter.</p>
<p>By Monday, things at the command post were in full swing.</p>
<p>Volunteers helped answer phones, and locals dropped off water and food for searchers.</p>
<p>It was around this time that Chief Manor and other law enforcement officers involved began</p>
<p>to internally switch their mindset from a rescue operation to a recovery.</p>
<p>About four or five days into it, you start thinking, obviously she hasn&rsquo;t appeared.</p>
<p>And as far as the searching of the area, that grid search starts getting bigger and bigger</p>
<p>and bigger as they start moving out.</p>
<p>How far could a five-year-old girl walk out?</p>
<p>More or less, their focus changed from looking for Leanna hiding in a tree to searching for</p>
<p>her body.</p>
<p>As all of that was happening, officers were collecting information about sex offenders</p>
<p>that lived in Leanna&rsquo;s neighborhood and any others within a five-mile radius.</p>
<p>Other tips had come in suggesting that investigators look into a group of people who&rsquo;d been in</p>
<p>town for a charity motorcycle ride and concert on the day Leanna vanished.</p>
<p>Some other tips came in about a couple of cars that were seen in the area that locals</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t recognize, that they thought could have been related to that event, or maybe</p>
<p>were just totally random sightings that felt out of place.</p>
<p>Police worked these leads for six days, and on Friday, June 20th, they announced at a</p>
<p>press conference that they were looking for specific information about a light blue car</p>
<p>with an antenna mounted in the middle of the trunk.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t say why they were focused on this particular car, but I have to think that</p>
<p>one or more of those tips that came in they felt were credible and could have been about</p>
<p>these weird cars in the area.</p>
<p>At that press conference, police also adjusted their timeline.</p>
<p>Up until that point, they weren&rsquo;t 100% certain about when Leanna left home and when she knocked</p>
<p>on the quirk&rsquo;s door, but they said that after doing multiple interviews with neighbors,</p>
<p>they were confident that Leanna walked away from her house at 4.35 p.m. and knocked on</p>
<p>the quirk&rsquo;s door at 5.15.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s roughly 40 minutes.</p>
<p>Since it didn&rsquo;t take that long to walk a block and a half, police wondered what took</p>
<p>her so long to get to the quirks.</p>
<p>At the press conference, police asked anyone with any information that could help fill</p>
<p>in the gap of time to call them.</p>
<p>By July 3rd, Leanna had been missing for almost three weeks, and police had investigated 1,000</p>
<p>leads and scrutinized the alibis of 130 sex offenders in the area.</p>
<p>Some of these individuals had been ruled out, but not all of them were cleared.</p>
<p>Later that month, police asked the public for help finding three men who might have</p>
<p>information helpful to the investigation.</p>
<p>They were registered sex offenders who had not yet provided alibis for the afternoon</p>
<p>of June 14th, but ultimately, information did come in and police eventually did rule</p>
<p>them out.</p>
<p>After that, the department expanded its sex offender interviews to include all registered</p>
<p>sex offenders in a 10-mile radius from the Warner home.</p>
<p>And not long after this second round of sex offender interviews got underway, police announced</p>
<p>that they were looking for a white man in his 30s who was 5'10&quot;, 155 pounds, with</p>
<p>a dark tattoo of a star or sun on his right arm, who was wearing blue jeans and a white</p>
<p>t-shirt on the day Leanna disappeared.</p>
<p>They said he had blonde, feathery hair and might have been in Leanna&rsquo;s neighborhood</p>
<p>the day she vanished.</p>
<p>Also around that time, police announced that they were looking for another car of interest</p>
<p>‚Äî a maroon and blue Cadillac driven by a black man in his 20s or 30s with a shaved</p>
<p>head.</p>
<p>And finally, officers said that they wanted to find witnesses who might have seen a brown</p>
<p>rusty pickup driven by a white man with black curly hair.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re keeping track here, that&rsquo;s three different cars, all of different makes</p>
<p>and models that authorities say they&rsquo;re looking for that were possibly connected to</p>
<p>the case, and a couple of very different descriptions of men they wanted to talk to regarding the</p>
<p>investigation.</p>
<p>Police relied on the public to help them investigate these angles, but never gave their reasoning</p>
<p>for putting this information out there.</p>
<p>It was obvious they were casting wide nets to get any information they could.</p>
<p>By late July, Leanna&rsquo;s disappearance had the attention of more than just local reporters.</p>
<p>News crews from around the region and other states came up to Chisholm and stayed there</p>
<p>for weeks, covering every development in the case.</p>
<p>Investigators continued to toss out more names as they ruled out area sex offenders, and</p>
<p>public pressure helped them expedite the process of getting those people&rsquo;s alibis confirmed.</p>
<p>By August, two months after Leanna went missing, police got their first big break.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when they zeroed in on a person of interest.</p>
<p>Police in Chisholm had been investigating a man named Matthew James Curtis for crimes</p>
<p>completely unrelated to Leanna&rsquo;s disappearance, but crimes that made them concerned he could</p>
<p>be involved.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d been working a case against him for possession of child sex abuse material.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s scary is that he was practically neighbors with the Warner family.</p>
<p>He was left a couple houses down on the corner, not the corner she walked by when she left,</p>
<p>the opposite corner.</p>
<p>While executing a search warrant on his house, police found the child sex abuse material,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t find any evidence linking him to Leanna.</p>
<p>Police had interviewed Matthew during a neighborhood canvass the day after Leanna went missing,</p>
<p>and again four days later, and he said that he knew nothing about her.</p>
<p>They were able to arrest him and charge him for having the illicit material, but he got</p>
<p>out on bond.</p>
<p>And again, the entire time he denied having anything to do with Leanna going missing.</p>
<p>In mid-September, the day before Matthew was due back in court, three men practicing archery</p>
<p>on U.S. Forest Service land outside Chisholm found him dead in his pickup truck with a</p>
<p>bag over his head.</p>
<p>The coroner said that he died of suffocation and all signs pointed to him taking his own</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>That news made everyone in the area even more suspicious that Matthew might have been involved</p>
<p>in what happened to Leanna.</p>
<p>But when police got a chance to search his truck and house again, they still found no</p>
<p>evidence linking him to her.</p>
<p>I mean nothing, not a hair, not a fiber, zip.</p>
<p>Authorities had to chalk up the fact that he lived so close to her combined with his</p>
<p>charges as really just a strange coincidence.</p>
<p>North Manor said they never actually ruled Matthew out, but they also could never say</p>
<p>for sure that he had anything to do with her disappearance.</p>
<p>After Matthew&rsquo;s death, investigators had to move on.</p>
<p>And by that time, they&rsquo;d developed suspicions about another person of interest, a well-known</p>
<p>local criminal with a violent record named Bruce William Christensen.</p>
<p>Every time we get a lead, even if the lead seems to be regurgitated and the same lead</p>
<p>seems spun off, regurgitated, but a little bit of a twist on it, we investigate it because</p>
<p>it came from someone new, it came from&hellip;</p>
<p>So Bruce Christensen&rsquo;s a great example of this.</p>
<p>Bruce&rsquo;s name had come in from several tips that people had called into the police department&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hotline.</p>
<p>The reports indicated that Bruce had seen Kaylin and Chris Warner out one night after</p>
<p>Leanna disappeared, and he screamed at them for people trying to blame him for what happened</p>
<p>to her.</p>
<p>When police tracked Bruce down and questioned him about the incident and what his alibi</p>
<p>was for the day Leanna vanished, he denied being involved, and provided a pretty solid</p>
<p>alibi.</p>
<p>And he was out of town, he was out of state, and family confirmed that.</p>
<p>By October, after getting all the necessary permits needed, investigators partially drained</p>
<p>Longyear Lake, which is where the dogs had picked up Leanna&rsquo;s scent.</p>
<p>Now, none of the aerial searches had detected a body being in the lake, but to eliminate</p>
<p>the possibility of her having drowned, police wanted to do a really thorough search.</p>
<p>By this time, winter was creeping in, as it does every fall in northern Minnesota, so</p>
<p>they were almost done draining the lake when the water started to freeze over.</p>
<p>Because of that, they had to conduct the search with some water still in the lake, but from</p>
<p>a helicopter investigators could see all the way to the bottom, and Leanna&rsquo;s body wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>No bodies were.</p>
<p>Because of the cold weather and lack of information coming in, police scaled back the search for</p>
<p>Leanna.</p>
<p>But the investigation into what happened to her continued.</p>
<p>They forged on tracking down and corroborating alibis for area sex offenders, and they worked</p>
<p>diligently to try to confirm all of those.</p>
<p>But around this time, the department got a frantic 911 call that made them pause.</p>
<p>It was from Leanna&rsquo;s dad, Chris, but it had nothing to do with the disappearance of</p>
<p>his daughter.</p>
<p>When Chris called 911 in late 2003, he told police that his wife Kaylin had just tried</p>
<p>to run him over with their car.</p>
<p>When officers got to the scene, the couple admitted that they had a fight and Chris got</p>
<p>out and walked away.</p>
<p>According to reporting by the Associated Press, Kaylin said that she didn&rsquo;t actually try</p>
<p>to hit her husband, but that the gear got stuck in the car and it went into him.</p>
<p>But police ended up charging her with a misdemeanor that she later pled guilty to.</p>
<p>Chief Manor said that alcohol was involved in the Warner&rsquo;s altercation, but that the</p>
<p>incident didn&rsquo;t change the course of the investigation into what happened to their</p>
<p>daughter.</p>
<p>Kaylin&rsquo;s arrest was splashed all over the local news with headlines like,</p>
<p>Missing girl&rsquo;s mom charged with trying to run over her husband.</p>
<p>A lot of people in town started to be less sympathetic towards the family.</p>
<p>But eventually things quieted down, thanks a lot in part to Jacob Wetterling&rsquo;s mom.</p>
<p>She was quoted in the Minneapolis Star Tribune warning people to stop speculating because</p>
<p>most people don&rsquo;t understand the toll a missing child takes on parents and marriages.</p>
<p>Police reiterated to reporters at the time that the Warners weren&rsquo;t suspects in their</p>
<p>daughter&rsquo;s case, and that incident between them over the car was completely unrelated.</p>
<p>The Warners had made up by the end of 2003 and continued to keep the porch light on at</p>
<p>their Chisholm home, just in case by some miracle Leanna found her way.</p>
<p>An entire year went by with not even a sighting of Leanna.</p>
<p>Around the one year mark, another big search for her was organized.</p>
<p>At least 50 volunteers combed through the woods and tall grasses in a grid search around</p>
<p>Chisholm, looking for any clues they might have missed before, but they turned up nothing.</p>
<p>According to reporting by the Associated Press that appeared in the Minneapolis Star Tribune,</p>
<p>in the fall of 2004 there was another blast of attention on the case when a local candidate</p>
<p>running for commissioner proposed an idea for anyone in the state of Minnesota who was</p>
<p>running for office that election cycle to hand out information and flyers about Leanna</p>
<p>as they campaigned door to door.</p>
<p>The Warners liked the idea, and a lot of political candidates voiced their support, but unfortunately</p>
<p>nothing significant came from it.</p>
<p>Then in 2005, police got what they thought would be their big break.</p>
<p>Hundreds of miles away in Idaho, a violent criminal named Joseph Duncan was arrested</p>
<p>and charged with abducting an 8-year-old and killing her whole family.</p>
<p>When police saw the news about Joseph&rsquo;s arrest, they started looking into his travel history,</p>
<p>just curious to know if it was possible that he&rsquo;d ever been anywhere near Leanna Warner&rsquo;s</p>
<p>home in June of 2003.</p>
<p>He did have ties to Minnesota, but to the far western part of Minnesota.</p>
<p>But interestingly, when police looked into Joseph, they came across a disturbing website.</p>
<p>He kept an online blog where he wrote about the stigmas that came along with being labeled</p>
<p>as a sex offender.</p>
<p>You see, Joseph had spent some time in prison when he was a teen for sexually assaulting</p>
<p>a boy.</p>
<p>In one of his posts on this website from January 2004, he wrote that he was worried he would</p>
<p>be blamed for the disappearance of a little girl from Chisholm, Minnesota.</p>
<p>You know, that helped make people think that, well, here we go and we&rsquo;ve got a monster we</p>
<p>can pin it on.</p>
<p>But even as good as Joseph looked as a suspect, police in Minnesota couldn&rsquo;t place him in</p>
<p>Chisholm in June 2003.</p>
<p>They did.</p>
<p>It was actually, he was moved out quite quickly because of FBI and, you know, you had everybody</p>
<p>working that case.</p>
<p>And through travel records, credit card purchases, they were able to substantiate that while</p>
<p>he was in Minnesota, it was just on that western region.</p>
<p>By 2006, tips and leads in this case had crawled to a standstill.</p>
<p>Police released an age-progressed photo of Leanna because they were having a lot of tips</p>
<p>come in from people saying, hey, I saw a toddler at the grocery store who might have been Leanna.</p>
<p>Basically, people were forgetting that if Leanna was still alive by 2006, she wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be five years old anymore.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d be eight and she would not have looked as young as she did when she disappeared.</p>
<p>The Warners also went on the news any chance they could to keep the public aware of their</p>
<p>daughter&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>But by 2008, the case was cold.</p>
<p>If you told me aliens abducted her, I couldn&rsquo;t prove you wrong at this point.</p>
<p>If you believe in aliens, yep, it could have been.</p>
<p>Because I have nothing, this is the hardest part about this.</p>
<p>Then, out of the blue and to everyone&rsquo;s surprise, someone confessed.</p>
<p>Someone police had heard of before.</p>
<p>Bruce Christensen.</p>
<p>Bruce was the guy who, years earlier, had been on investigators&rsquo; radar for yelling</p>
<p>at the Warners.</p>
<p>But his alibi at the time about being out of state when Leanna disappeared checked out.</p>
<p>Still, police decided to see what he had to say.</p>
<p>It was 2008 and he was in solitary confinement in a Minnesota prison on drug charges when</p>
<p>he was like, you know what, never mind, I actually did abduct Leanna.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s important to know that while serving his time, Bruce had actually killed another</p>
<p>inmate.</p>
<p>After that, a judge had re-sentenced him for murder charges and tossed him into solitary</p>
<p>confinement.</p>
<p>Chief Manor said that Bruce was on such strict lockdown at the prison that he didn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>outdoor recreation time or any interaction with other inmates or guards.</p>
<p>When Bruce came forward claiming he killed Leanna, he provided specific details of where</p>
<p>authorities would find her body.</p>
<p>And at the time, he says he murdered her and buried her.</p>
<p>So Bruce was actually taken out of prison and brought to the area that he said he buried</p>
<p>Leanna Warner, which was extensively searched thereafter.</p>
<p>The area Bruce said that he buried Leanna was called Maple Hill, and it was in the nearby</p>
<p>town of Hibbing, Minnesota, which is just 10 minutes southwest of Chisholm.</p>
<p>When investigators dug at the spot where Bruce told them to, they found a bag under the soil</p>
<p>with what looked like remains in it.</p>
<p>But when they opened up the sack, what was inside was a huge letdown.</p>
<p>It was just a cat buried in that spot.</p>
<p>Bruce never said whether it was his cat or not.</p>
<p>How did he know about a cat grave?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming it was his cat.</p>
<p>Police continued to search the Maple Hill area for more than a week, and they found</p>
<p>absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>In the end, when detectives pressed Bruce about his claims, he broke down and told them</p>
<p>the real truth.</p>
<p>He confessed to he made it all up because he wanted to get out of prison one more time</p>
<p>and see the light of day and smell fresh air.</p>
<p>Investigators were not happy with Bruce.</p>
<p>After all these years of exhaustive searches, a bored inmate who had nothing to lose decided</p>
<p>to send them on a wild goose chase.</p>
<p>The blunder with Bruce was a setback, but it didn&rsquo;t stall the investigation entirely.</p>
<p>Even though Leanna&rsquo;s case was still considered cold, detectives looked into every tip that</p>
<p>came in.</p>
<p>And that has been where Leanna&rsquo;s case has stood for the past 14 years.</p>
<p>Chief Manor says there are no other missing children from Chisholm except Leanna.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the town&rsquo;s sweetheart and has never been far from everyone&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>Local news outlets run anniversary reports here and there, but for the most part, news</p>
<p>coverage has halted.</p>
<p>The last big wave of media attention in the case was in May 2021, when People Magazine</p>
<p>ran a spread about it.</p>
<p>Chris and Kaylin Warner didn&rsquo;t feel up to talking with us for this episode, and I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>imagine how many media outlets they&rsquo;ve talked to over the years, and they&rsquo;ve still gotten</p>
<p>no answers.</p>
<p>For years, people online have criticized them for letting Leanna walk to her friend&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house alone.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been parent-shamed like no other.</p>
<p>But Chief Manor cuts them some slack because he says they&rsquo;ve suffered enough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a quiet little town where everybody knows everybody, and what we do here versus</p>
<p>what people do in a bigger city are totally different.</p>
<p>The most recent tip Chief Manor&rsquo;s department looked into came in 2020, when they got a</p>
<p>kind of bizarre call.</p>
<p>It was from a young woman claiming to be Leanna, and she wanted to speak with investigators.</p>
<p>But that girl herself called us and said, I think I&rsquo;m Leanna Warner.</p>
<p>It obviously turned out not to be her, but that&rsquo;s why we still have hope.</p>
<p>The woman had been adopted and wasn&rsquo;t familiar with her lineage.</p>
<p>She said that she&rsquo;d seen the age-progressed photo of Leanna and realized that she had</p>
<p>similar features to her.</p>
<p>To be absolutely sure, Chisholm Police took a sample of her DNA, and the results definitely</p>
<p>ruled her out as a possible match for Leanna.</p>
<p>As of today, the Chisholm Police Department say they&rsquo;ve investigated 2,000 different</p>
<p>leads in Leanna&rsquo;s case, but they&rsquo;re waiting for the right one to come that will help them</p>
<p>make significant progress.</p>
<p>Somebody out there knows something.</p>
<p>Somebody knows a piece of information that will steer us in the right direction and bring</p>
<p>peace for this family.</p>
<p>And that somebody might be Leanna herself, without even knowing it.</p>
<p>Not a lot of cards that we come across give room for hope.</p>
<p>Usually it&rsquo;s pretty clear what happened to the person, and now we&rsquo;re just seeking justice.</p>
<p>But this case, you guys, in this case, I can&rsquo;t shake the feeling that Leanna could really</p>
<p>be out there.</p>
<p>You know, they say that the most simple explanation is often the correct one.</p>
<p>Someone gave her that case of Barbie&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>She talked about another family, and there were potentially people looking in her window.</p>
<p>Over the years, authorities have tried every avenue to try and get answers.</p>
<p>They even sent off that mysterious Barbie doll case to try and get DNA evidence, but</p>
<p>nothing has come from it.</p>
<p>Leanna would be 24 when this episode is released.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re listening to this, please take a moment and go to thedeckpodcast.com and</p>
<p>look at the picture we have of Leanna.</p>
<p>Does that child resemble you or someone you knew as a child?</p>
<p>I know this sounds wild, but just last year, another case like this got solved because</p>
<p>a grown woman saw a picture of a child who went missing years before and thought, wow,</p>
<p>that really looks like I did as a kid.</p>
<p>Chief Manor says they won&rsquo;t stop until Leanna is found, and they&rsquo;re willing to look into</p>
<p>any tip, big or small.</p>
<p>Like I said, Leanna Warner would be in her mid-20s today, and despite the nonstop investigation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been going on since 2003, police have no idea if she&rsquo;s dead or alive.</p>
<p>A sweet little girl who had her whole life still ahead of her was taken, and the police</p>
<p>and the people of Chisholm, Minnesota, including her parents, won&rsquo;t rest easy until they learn</p>
<p>her fate.</p>
<p>If you know anything about the 2003 abduction of Leanna Warner, please call the Chisholm</p>
<p>Police Department at 218-254-7915.</p>
