    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are discussing grief.</p>
<p>Grief is a natural emotion that most everybody experiences</p>
<p>at some point in their life.</p>
<p>However, grief is something</p>
<p>that still mystifies most people.</p>
<p>For instance, we often wonder</p>
<p>why getting over the loss of somebody or a pet</p>
<p>is so absolutely crushing.</p>
<p>In some cases, it&rsquo;s obvious</p>
<p>because we had a very close relationship</p>
<p>to that person or animal.</p>
<p>But in other cases, it&rsquo;s bewildering</p>
<p>because somehow, despite our best efforts,</p>
<p>we are unable to reframe and shift our mind</p>
<p>to the idea that the person or animal</p>
<p>that at one point was here and so very present is now gone.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to discuss how we conceptualize grief,</p>
<p>both at an emotional and at a logical level.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to teach you about the neuroscience</p>
<p>and the psychology of grief</p>
<p>and incredible findings that have been made</p>
<p>in just a few key laboratories</p>
<p>that point to the fact</p>
<p>that we essentially map our experience of people</p>
<p>in three dimensions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just give you a little hint</p>
<p>of what those dimensions are.</p>
<p>They relate to space, where people are,</p>
<p>time, when people are, I&rsquo;ll explain what that means,</p>
<p>and a dimension called closeness</p>
<p>and how those three dimensions of space, time, and closeness</p>
<p>are what establish very close bonds with people</p>
<p>and are what require remapping, reorganization</p>
<p>within our emotional framework and our logical framework</p>
<p>when we lose somebody for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Within that understanding,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m confident that you will have greater insight</p>
<p>into the grief process.</p>
<p>And should you ever find yourself within the grief process,</p>
<p>as I imagine most everyone will at some point,</p>
<p>you will be able to navigate that process</p>
<p>in what psychologists and neuroscientists</p>
<p>deem to be the most healthy way of going through grief.</p>
<p>Indeed, moving through grief</p>
<p>requires a specific form of neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>a reordering of brain connections,</p>
<p>and also the connections between the brain and body.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to teach you about all of that today.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to learn a lot of scientific information.</p>
<p>You will also learn a lot of tools</p>
<p>that you can put in your kit of emotional</p>
<p>and really emotional physical tools</p>
<p>that will allow you to move through grief</p>
<p>in this healthy way that I referred to earlier.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also point out some of the myths about grief.</p>
<p>For instance, many of you have probably heard</p>
<p>that there are designated stages of grief</p>
<p>that everybody moves through.</p>
<p>It turns out that recent research refutes that idea.</p>
<p>There are different stages of grief,</p>
<p>but not everybody experiences all of them.</p>
<p>And hardly ever does somebody move through</p>
<p>all of those linearly, meaning in the same order.</p>
<p>I also want to point out that for many of you</p>
<p>that are not experiencing grief in this moment,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an important scientific literature</p>
<p>that teaches us that how we show up to grief,</p>
<p>meaning our psychological and our biological state</p>
<p>that we happen to be in when a loss occurs,</p>
<p>strongly dictates whether or not we end up</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s called complicated or non-complicated grief.</p>
<p>And non-complicated grief is a form of grief</p>
<p>that is very prolonged, and in fact,</p>
<p>often requires that people get</p>
<p>substantial professional help.</p>
<p>So whether or not you&rsquo;re experiencing grief</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s mild, moderate, or very intense right now,</p>
<p>or whether or not you are not experiencing</p>
<p>any grief at all, you&rsquo;re going to learn</p>
<p>scientific information and tools that will help you</p>
<p>navigate through this process that we call grief.</p>
<p>Before I begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme, I&rsquo;d like to thank</p>
<p>the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects of our brain</p>
<p>and body health, even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine.</p>
<p>Many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3,</p>
<p>and K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>has now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally,</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about grief.</p>
<p>I just want to remind you that everybody,</p>
<p>at some point in their life, experiences grief,</p>
<p>either mild grief, moderate grief, or extreme grief.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s somewhat obvious, but worth stating nonetheless,</p>
<p>that how intense grief feels and how long it lasts</p>
<p>scales with how close we were with somebody.</p>
<p>And if you learn that the person who works at the coffee shop</p>
<p>or that you see at the coffee shop on a regular basis</p>
<p>happened to pass away or tragically get killed</p>
<p>in a car accident, that can be quite upsetting.</p>
<p>It can be somewhat disorienting to you.</p>
<p>If you, for instance, just saw them yesterday,</p>
<p>or they seemed perfectly fine when you saw them last.</p>
<p>But of course, the grief that results</p>
<p>from the loss of somebody</p>
<p>to whom you have that level of attachment</p>
<p>is far and away different than the level of grief</p>
<p>that you would experience</p>
<p>from the death of a very close loved one,</p>
<p>a sibling, a parent, God forbid, a child.</p>
<p>When that type of loss occurs,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s often the case that our entire relationship to life</p>
<p>feels different.</p>
<p>Places and things that at once brought us joy and laughter</p>
<p>now bring the opposite.</p>
<p>They bring us intense feelings of sadness and loss.</p>
<p>Psychologists and neuroscientists distinguish</p>
<p>between complicated grief and non-complicated grief.</p>
<p>They are very similar at the outset.</p>
<p>One of the fundamental differences between them, however,</p>
<p>is that complicated grief,</p>
<p>which occurs in about one in 10 people,</p>
<p>is a situation in which grief</p>
<p>does not seem to resolve itself</p>
<p>even after a prolonged period of time.</p>
<p>Later in the episode,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll point you to the actual tests that are used.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve provided links to those in the show note captions</p>
<p>that will allow you to distinguish</p>
<p>between complicated and non-complicated grief.</p>
<p>These arrive through the important research</p>
<p>of the world-class grief researchers that are out there</p>
<p>and the psychologists that treat grief.</p>
<p>The important thing to point out is that grief is a process.</p>
<p>Like any biological or psychological event,</p>
<p>it has a beginning, a middle, and an end.</p>
<p>And I do believe that being able to orient</p>
<p>in terms of where you are in that process</p>
<p>can be immensely beneficial,</p>
<p>not just for predicting how long it&rsquo;s going to last,</p>
<p>but in order to conceptualize the person or animal</p>
<p>that you lost in a way that allows you</p>
<p>to best preserve their memory</p>
<p>while maintaining your own functional capacity in life.</p>
<p>Along those lines, I want to point out</p>
<p>that grief and depression,</p>
<p>while they can feel quite similar in certain ways</p>
<p>and have overlapping symptomology,</p>
<p>loss of appetite, challenges sleeping,</p>
<p>crying in the middle of the day</p>
<p>for no apparent reason, et cetera,</p>
<p>they are distinctly different processes.</p>
<p>The modern research teaches us, for instance,</p>
<p>that grief rarely responds well to antidepressants,</p>
<p>whereas depression can often respond well</p>
<p>to antidepressants.</p>
<p>Everything we know and understand about grief</p>
<p>is that it is a distinct psychological</p>
<p>and physiological event in the brain and body</p>
<p>from depression.</p>
<p>Rather, perhaps the best way to think about grief</p>
<p>is that it is actually a motivational state.</p>
<p>It is a yearning, it is a desire for something.</p>
<p>And somewhat surprisingly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just a desire to have that person back</p>
<p>or to have that animal back.</p>
<p>You might think, well, that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Of course it is.</p>
<p>But of course there are instances</p>
<p>in which someone passing away or an animal passing away</p>
<p>is actually providing relief for that person</p>
<p>because of where they happen to be in their life.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;ll teach you about grief as a motivational process</p>
<p>because grief as a motivational process</p>
<p>really is the way that scientists and psychologists</p>
<p>now conceptualize grief and the treatments for grief</p>
<p>so that people can move through them effectively.</p>
<p>As we wade into this important topic,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to emphasize some of the common myths</p>
<p>and misunderstandings about grief.</p>
<p>Some of the myths and misunderstanding</p>
<p>arrive from the beautiful work of Elizabeth Kubler-Ross,</p>
<p>a psychologist who wrote the famous book</p>
<p>on death and dying.</p>
<p>And I should emphasize that while Kubler-Ross</p>
<p>was a real pioneer in establishing</p>
<p>that there are indeed different stages of grief,</p>
<p>the modern science, both psychology and neuroscience,</p>
<p>point to the fact that not everybody experiences</p>
<p>all of the stages that Kubler-Ross defined,</p>
<p>nor do they move through those stages in a linear manner.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;re out of sequence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just highlight the five stages</p>
<p>that Kubler-Ross illustrated</p>
<p>because some people really do experience all of them.</p>
<p>Sometimes in the order I&rsquo;ll read them,</p>
<p>but again, oftentimes they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The different stages of grief very quickly</p>
<p>are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.</p>
<p>In the Kubler-Ross model, denial is always the first stage.</p>
<p>And denial is just as it sounds, this disbelief.</p>
<p>It cannot be, there&rsquo;s no way.</p>
<p>A refusal to accept the new reality</p>
<p>that the person or animal is gone.</p>
<p>The second stage, anger, is one in which</p>
<p>the individual recognizes that the person is indeed gone</p>
<p>or the animal is gone,</p>
<p>but their body and their mind go into a motivated state.</p>
<p>This is important.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to return to this idea of grief</p>
<p>as a motivated state that involves action plans</p>
<p>in more depth as we go further.</p>
<p>And then the third stage is bargaining,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s sometimes called the negotiating phase.</p>
<p>This idea that, well, if I had just done this,</p>
<p>or if they had just done that, or if I&rsquo;d called more,</p>
<p>or somehow refusing to accept the reality.</p>
<p>So in a way this can be blended with denial in thinking,</p>
<p>well, if I just don&rsquo;t think about it,</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t be real, this kind of thing.</p>
<p>So again, stages can be blended or braided together</p>
<p>because emotions are complex, right?</p>
<p>Even though there are different stages to this process,</p>
<p>they can sometimes be melded together.</p>
<p>The fourth stage of depression that Kubler-Ross described</p>
<p>is one of why go on living?</p>
<p>Why should I go on living?</p>
<p>Why should I continue in this grief stricken state</p>
<p>that seems to deprive me of all the richness of life</p>
<p>that I experienced when the person or animal was still here?</p>
<p>And then the fifth stage is acceptance.</p>
<p>This internalization, not just cognitively,</p>
<p>not just thinking, but emotionally,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s going to be okay.</p>
<p>That not just this too shall pass, but that it has passed.</p>
<p>So again, the five stages of grief that Kubler-Ross defined</p>
<p>were immensely important as a critical parsing</p>
<p>of the different stages that one could move through.</p>
<p>But unfortunately those five stages</p>
<p>were sort of taken to be gospel for a long time.</p>
<p>And we now know based on neuroimaging,</p>
<p>based on more in-depth psychological evaluation,</p>
<p>and frankly, more researchers and clinicians</p>
<p>moving into this area and observing</p>
<p>that while much of what Kubler-Ross described</p>
<p>does hold true, it&rsquo;s not always the case.</p>
<p>And in fact, the contour of the grief process</p>
<p>actually has a lot of dimensions</p>
<p>that are not encapsulated by those five stages.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a lot of variation</p>
<p>depending on whether or not the loss is due to old age,</p>
<p>disease, whether or not there was suffering prior or not,</p>
<p>suicide or non-suicide types, deaths and losses,</p>
<p>and even grief about non-death losses,</p>
<p>a relationship breakup or something of that sort,</p>
<p>or even homesickness and things of that sort.</p>
<p>So I do want to tip our hats</p>
<p>to the incredible work of Elizabeth Kubler-Ross.</p>
<p>By no means am I or do other researchers</p>
<p>try and discount her incredible contributions,</p>
<p>but I think nowadays we have a different</p>
<p>and frankly a better understanding</p>
<p>of what the grief process is like,</p>
<p>and as a consequence, better tools to move through grief.</p>
<p>In order to really understand what grief is</p>
<p>in your brain and body and how to best navigate grief,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like you to do an experiment with me.</p>
<p>For the next five minutes or so,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like you to at least try to discard</p>
<p>of all prior notions of grief as just a state of sadness.</p>
<p>I want to acknowledge that it is and does involve sadness,</p>
<p>but for right now, let&rsquo;s think about grief</p>
<p>as a motivational state, as a desire for something specific.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;d like you to think about grief</p>
<p>as an attempt to reach out and get something</p>
<p>that you very much want.</p>
<p>Imagine yourself extremely thirsty, for instance,</p>
<p>on a very hot day,</p>
<p>and a glass of water is right in front of you,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a beautiful, clean glass of water,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s completely full,</p>
<p>and you so badly want to drink that water,</p>
<p>but no matter how intensely you want it</p>
<p>and no matter how hard you try and reach it,</p>
<p>it always shifts just outside your reach.</p>
<p>So if you can imagine that, even just a little bit,</p>
<p>you are touching into the experience of grief.</p>
<p>How do I know this?</p>
<p>Well, I know this because brain imaging studies</p>
<p>involving what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, fMRI,</p>
<p>in which you can evaluate</p>
<p>which brain areas are more active than others</p>
<p>according to blood flow,</p>
<p>which correlates with neural activity and so forth,</p>
<p>teaches us that the brain areas that are associated</p>
<p>with motivation and craving and pursuit</p>
<p>are some of the primary brain areas and circuits</p>
<p>that are activated in states of grief.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to share an important paper with you</p>
<p>as one of the first to illustrate the fact</p>
<p>that grief is not just a state of sadness and pain.</p>
<p>It is indeed a state of yearning and desire</p>
<p>of something that is just outside your reach,</p>
<p>and unfortunately will always be just outside your reach</p>
<p>until you remap your relationship to that person or thing.</p>
<p>The title of this paper is posed first as a question,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ll read it as such.</p>
<p>The title is Craving Love,</p>
<p>Enduring Grief Activates Brain&rsquo;s Reward Center.</p>
<p>And the first author of this paper is Mary Frances O&rsquo;Connor.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a professor of psychology at the University of Arizona</p>
<p>and one of the world leaders in the study of grief</p>
<p>from a neuroscience perspective.</p>
<p>With some luck, we&rsquo;ll get her here</p>
<p>on the podcast as a guest.</p>
<p>Now, this paper has several important features.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just highlight a few.</p>
<p>One of the features of this paper that&rsquo;s not surprising</p>
<p>is they found that people who are in a state of grief</p>
<p>are in a state of pain.</p>
<p>That is brain areas associated with pain,</p>
<p>actual physical pain are more active</p>
<p>than in non-grieving individuals.</p>
<p>However, they also found that people who are experiencing</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called complicated grief</p>
<p>showed reward-related activity in a brain area</p>
<p>called the nucleus accumbens.</p>
<p>What is reward-related activity?</p>
<p>Reward-related activity is activity of neurons</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s associated with motivational states.</p>
<p>And the nucleus accumbens is a brain center</p>
<p>in which dopamine has the effect</p>
<p>of creating a motivated state.</p>
<p>If ever you thought that dopamine</p>
<p>was only associated with feeling good,</p>
<p>you hear about dopamine hits,</p>
<p>well, this paper and papers like it</p>
<p>firmly tell us that dopamine is not about feeling good.</p>
<p>Dopamine is about placing us into a state</p>
<p>of desiring things and seeking things.</p>
<p>This is true in addiction.</p>
<p>This is true when we&rsquo;re hungry and we want to eat.</p>
<p>This is true when we want to reproduce.</p>
<p>This is true in every state</p>
<p>in which we are reaching for something</p>
<p>outside our immediate ability</p>
<p>to give that thing to ourselves.</p>
<p>This is very important to understand</p>
<p>if you want to understand grief</p>
<p>and how to move through grief.</p>
<p>Grief is not just about sadness.</p>
<p>It is a state of sadness,</p>
<p>hence the activation of brain areas associated with pain.</p>
<p>And it is a state of desire and reaching for something.</p>
<p>And for those of you that have experienced grief,</p>
<p>I think that will resonate with you.</p>
<p>In that understanding that grief is both a state of pain,</p>
<p>but also a state of wanting.</p>
<p>And in the understanding that when we lose somebody,</p>
<p>either because of breakup or because of death,</p>
<p>or if an animal dies or gets taken away or is missing,</p>
<p>that state of wanting and desire</p>
<p>drives an activation state within us.</p>
<p>Now, the key thing to understand</p>
<p>is that the activation of those reward centers</p>
<p>and the involvement of dopamine</p>
<p>puts us into an anticipatory state,</p>
<p>a state of waiting for something to happen.</p>
<p>It also puts us into a state of action or desiring action.</p>
<p>Our body and our mind are what I like to refer to</p>
<p>as center of mass forward.</p>
<p>We are seeking how to resolve the craving,</p>
<p>even if we know that is impossible.</p>
<p>Why do I say that?</p>
<p>Well, we understand also on the basis</p>
<p>of brain imaging studies and also some studies in animals</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll describe in a moment,</p>
<p>that in order to understand grief,</p>
<p>we have to understand how attachments</p>
<p>are represented in our brain.</p>
<p>And it turns out that both attachments</p>
<p>and the breaking of attachments in healthy ways</p>
<p>are governed by three important, what we call dimensions.</p>
<p>A dimension is just some feature of the world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s represented in our brain.</p>
<p>So for instance, the color red doesn&rsquo;t exist in your brain.</p>
<p>You happen to have cells, neurons in your eye</p>
<p>that respond best to long wavelengths of light.</p>
<p>And those long wavelengths of light</p>
<p>happen to be what are reflected off things</p>
<p>that are perceived as red.</p>
<p>So in your mind, you have a notion of red.</p>
<p>I know this is a little bit abstract,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not actually lighting up red neurons</p>
<p>in your brain, and that&rsquo;s why you see red.</p>
<p>You are lighting up neurons in your brain</p>
<p>that represent the presence of red things</p>
<p>in your environment.</p>
<p>Similarly, we have neurons and maps,</p>
<p>or we say representations of other dimensions.</p>
<p>We have dimensions of touch.</p>
<p>We have dimensions of sound.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;ll now teach you,</p>
<p>we have three dimensions that define our relationship</p>
<p>to people and animals and things.</p>
<p>And when those people, animals, and things</p>
<p>are within our immediate vicinity,</p>
<p>or if we know how we could access them, right?</p>
<p>If somebody&rsquo;s still alive,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s generally some way to access them</p>
<p>unless they&rsquo;re refusing to interact with us.</p>
<p>Well, when we understand that,</p>
<p>our motivational states can operate in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s logical.</p>
<p>We know that, for instance,</p>
<p>if we want to find our mother, brother, sister,</p>
<p>significant other, dog, cat, parrot, et cetera,</p>
<p>we have to go through a certain set of steps.</p>
<p>What are those three dimensions and how do they work?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to teach you now.</p>
<p>So at risk of sounding a little bit too reductionist,</p>
<p>we are now going to describe your relationship</p>
<p>to anything, everything, and anyone</p>
<p>in these three dimensions.</p>
<p>How can we do that?</p>
<p>Why would we even want to do that?</p>
<p>Why would we want to rob the complexity of relationships</p>
<p>of their contour and their detail?</p>
<p>Well, if we can understand the dimensions</p>
<p>in which we map our relationship to people,</p>
<p>animals, and things,</p>
<p>then we can understand why it is</p>
<p>that when those people, animals, or things</p>
<p>are not accessible to us,</p>
<p>why it hurts so much</p>
<p>and why it takes a certain amount of time</p>
<p>in order to re-understand, if you will,</p>
<p>or remap our association to them.</p>
<p>I promise that in grasping the information</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to give you,</p>
<p>you will be able to better orient in the grief process</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be able to move through it more effectively.</p>
<p>The three dimensions of relating to someone</p>
<p>or an animal or a thing are space, time, and closeness.</p>
<p>And in order to illustrate each one</p>
<p>and how they work together to support relationships</p>
<p>and their involvement in the grieving process,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell you about an experiment.</p>
<p>This experiment was actually done.</p>
<p>The experiment involves putting people into a brain scanner</p>
<p>that allows the researcher to evaluate brain activity</p>
<p>in different areas.</p>
<p>In fact, can look in a very non-biased way,</p>
<p>not make any predictions about which brain areas</p>
<p>are going to be involved.</p>
<p>And the experiment is the following.</p>
<p>The person, we should say the research subject,</p>
<p>first sees images of things that reside</p>
<p>at different distances from one another.</p>
<p>And when I say things, these are objects.</p>
<p>So in one case, it&rsquo;s a beach or a parking lot</p>
<p>with bowling balls set at different distances</p>
<p>from one another.</p>
<p>Their brain is imaged.</p>
<p>And as their brain is imaged,</p>
<p>they see different pictures of different scenes,</p>
<p>the beach, the parking lot, et cetera,</p>
<p>bowling balls spaced in different ways,</p>
<p>close together, far apart,</p>
<p>regularly spaced, non-regularly spaced.</p>
<p>When one does this sort of experiment,</p>
<p>you see a lot of brain areas activated,</p>
<p>not surprisingly the visual cortex,</p>
<p>the area of the brain that is responsible</p>
<p>for creating visual perceptions,</p>
<p>but also a brain area that seems uniquely tuned</p>
<p>to the distance between you and the objects.</p>
<p>So whether or not the bowling balls are far away</p>
<p>or close together from one another,</p>
<p>and whether or not they are far away</p>
<p>or close to you physically.</p>
<p>So literally the distance between you and these objects,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll refer to that measure,</p>
<p>that dimension as we call it as proximity, okay?</p>
<p>Whether or not it&rsquo;s very close to you,</p>
<p>high degree of proximity or far away, low proximity,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s simply physical space.</p>
<p>Then subjects listen to tones.</p>
<p>Those tones also are spaced from one another.</p>
<p>So it could be something as simple</p>
<p>as my hand meeting the table top</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m happening to be sitting in front of.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>they image the brain.</p>
<p>Of course, areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are associated with auditory perception are active,</p>
<p>not surprisingly,</p>
<p>but as they evaluate different types of sounds</p>
<p>and patterns of sounds, for instance,</p>
<p>they can start to parse brain areas</p>
<p>that seem uniquely tuned to the spacing of sounds,</p>
<p>independent of what sounds are coming in.</p>
<p>So whether or not it&rsquo;s musical notes</p>
<p>or my hand hitting the table or human speech,</p>
<p>they identified a brain region that is uniquely tuned.</p>
<p>That is, it becomes active specifically in response</p>
<p>to changes in the spacing between sounds,</p>
<p>much in the same way as they could identify brain regions</p>
<p>that were only activated when there were changes</p>
<p>in the distance between objects,</p>
<p>such as the bowling balls</p>
<p>that I used in the previous example.</p>
<p>And then the subjects saw a different set of images.</p>
<p>The images that they saw were of people and of faces.</p>
<p>And some of the images that they saw</p>
<p>were of people&rsquo;s faces right up close.</p>
<p>And other images were of people at a distance</p>
<p>where you could see the whole body of the person.</p>
<p>Now, they also varied the emotional relationship</p>
<p>to those people.</p>
<p>That is, they were able to get photographs</p>
<p>from these research subjects&rsquo; lives.</p>
<p>So they could show them pictures of, for instance,</p>
<p>their sister or some random person off the street.</p>
<p>They could show them pictures of a parent or of a neighbor</p>
<p>or of a celebrity that&rsquo;s well-known</p>
<p>or of somebody that they didn&rsquo;t know at all.</p>
<p>So they were able to vary both the position of the person,</p>
<p>close or far, and they were able to vary</p>
<p>the emotional distance to the person,</p>
<p>which is this dimension that I&rsquo;m referring to</p>
<p>as closeness, which is not physical closeness,</p>
<p>but how attached or how well you know somebody.</p>
<p>Now, this is maybe sounding</p>
<p>like a somewhat complicated experiment,</p>
<p>but the takeaway from this experiment</p>
<p>is exquisitely simple and exquisitely important.</p>
<p>The result was that in all three conditions,</p>
<p>changes in the physical spacing of these objects,</p>
<p>changes in the temporal,</p>
<p>that is the time spacing of these sounds,</p>
<p>and changes in the emotional distance</p>
<p>between the subject and different people,</p>
<p>the same brain area was uniquely activated.</p>
<p>Now, that is an incredible thing to find</p>
<p>because what it suggests is that,</p>
<p>yes, of course, there are brain areas</p>
<p>that are associated with representation of visual objects.</p>
<p>And that, yes, of course, there are brain areas</p>
<p>associated with representation of different sounds.</p>
<p>And of course, there are brain areas</p>
<p>associated with faces.</p>
<p>We now know this.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s something called the fusiform face area,</p>
<p>which is uniquely tuned to faces.</p>
<p>But at the same time, there is a unique brain region</p>
<p>that is activated in all three of the conditions I described</p>
<p>that has to do with how far you are from somebody,</p>
<p>both in space, in time,</p>
<p>and in terms of emotional closeness.</p>
<p>And that brain area, it turns out,</p>
<p>is a brain area called the inferior parietal lobule,</p>
<p>the inferior parietal lobule.</p>
<p>Now, you don&rsquo;t need to know</p>
<p>where the inferior parietal lobule is.</p>
<p>In fact, you don&rsquo;t even need to know</p>
<p>the name of this brain area.</p>
<p>What you do need to know, however,</p>
<p>if you want to understand grief</p>
<p>and how to move through grief,</p>
<p>is that your map of people</p>
<p>is not a map of emotional closeness per se.</p>
<p>It is a map of emotional closeness,</p>
<p>what we call attachment,</p>
<p>that is interwoven, that is braided in</p>
<p>in a very intimate way</p>
<p>with your map of where they are in physical space</p>
<p>and where they are in time,</p>
<p>when you saw them last,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re likely to see them again.</p>
<p>And if you were to want to see them,</p>
<p>how much time it would take to reach them</p>
<p>or for them to reach you.</p>
<p>Now, earlier I said that one of the key functions</p>
<p>of our nervous system is to be able to make predictions.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s somewhat obvious,</p>
<p>but nonetheless important to state and restate</p>
<p>that one of the most powerful aspects</p>
<p>of our attachments to people, animals and things,</p>
<p>is our ability to predict</p>
<p>what it would take to see them again</p>
<p>and when we are going to see them again.</p>
<p>In fact, we could say that our ability to locate someone</p>
<p>or an animal or a thing in space and time, right?</p>
<p>Where they are and how long it would take</p>
<p>for us to reach them or them to reach us,</p>
<p>is a prediction of the requirements</p>
<p>to engage in the attachment.</p>
<p>In order to illustrate this at a little bit more depth,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just do a fill in the blank experiment.</p>
<p>You can do this now in real time.</p>
<p>I want you to think of somebody that you either rely on</p>
<p>or that you care about very, very much.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just allow you to fill in the blank</p>
<p>on this sentence.</p>
<p>If I want to see blank, the person or animal,</p>
<p>I could see them within blank amount of time, right?</p>
<p>If right now you wanted to see this person or animal</p>
<p>or maybe even a thing,</p>
<p>how long would it take you to reach them?</p>
<p>Could be a day, could be a second,</p>
<p>could be there right next to you.</p>
<p>All you&rsquo;d have to do is turn your head.</p>
<p>Now answer this.</p>
<p>If this person were to travel halfway around the world</p>
<p>and land in their plane,</p>
<p>I would expect to hear from them</p>
<p>within blank minutes of them landing.</p>
<p>The answers of this of course will differ.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like you to answer this question.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;d like to find myself,</p>
<p>it would take me X amount of time.</p>
<p>And of course, if you&rsquo;re listening to this</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re understanding it and you&rsquo;re of a rational mind,</p>
<p>the answer to that should be zero seconds, instantaneous.</p>
<p>You are always able to locate yourself in space and time</p>
<p>provided you are in the appropriate state of mind,</p>
<p>meaning not asleep, for instance.</p>
<p>That last question might seem somewhat silly,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a fundamentally important one</p>
<p>because it illustrates the extremes</p>
<p>at which we map our relationship to ourselves</p>
<p>relative to other people and things.</p>
<p>Now, if all of this sounds like a bunch of neuropsycho</p>
<p>babble parsing of the obvious,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d encourage you to suspend that belief</p>
<p>for the moment, because if you understand</p>
<p>that all relationships are mapped in the brain and body</p>
<p>through these three dimensions,</p>
<p>space, time, and closeness or proximity of space,</p>
<p>proximity in time and proximity of attachment,</p>
<p>how close or rich or bonded you are to someone.</p>
<p>Well, if you can understand that,</p>
<p>then it almost becomes obvious</p>
<p>or at least it becomes intuitive</p>
<p>as to why after the loss of somebody,</p>
<p>in particular, a death or the loss of an animal,</p>
<p>this map has to be reordered.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because if we are attached to someone or an animal</p>
<p>at a deep level, it is almost always on the basis</p>
<p>of a lot of what we call episodic experience,</p>
<p>a lot of episodic memories, memories of things that happen.</p>
<p>Episodic memories are literally the conscious recollection</p>
<p>of your experience of somebody or an animal or a thing.</p>
<p>And within that memory, you have an understanding</p>
<p>of what has happened with them in association to you,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on with them, where it happened,</p>
<p>when it happened.</p>
<p>You have a rich knowledge database</p>
<p>that we call implicit knowledge, right?</p>
<p>You might not be aware of it all the time,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s within you of what this person is like</p>
<p>and what they&rsquo;re doing in their life.</p>
<p>When somebody is taken away from us for whatever reason,</p>
<p>episodic memories persist for some period of time,</p>
<p>and they are still linked to our feelings of attachment.</p>
<p>Grief is the process of uncoupling, unbraiding,</p>
<p>and untangling that relationship</p>
<p>between where people are in space, in time,</p>
<p>and our attachment to them.</p>
<p>What I mean by this is when somebody or an animal</p>
<p>or a thing is taken from us, either by decision or by death,</p>
<p>or by circumstance, well, in that case,</p>
<p>our entire memory bank and our ability to predict</p>
<p>where and when they will be,</p>
<p>and therefore when we can feed our attachment to them again,</p>
<p>that whole map is obliterated,</p>
<p>except that the attachment itself has not been disrupted.</p>
<p>Assuming that you are deeply attached to someone</p>
<p>or an animal or a thing, that attachment persists,</p>
<p>and the grief process is one in which you have to reorder</p>
<p>your understanding of them in space and in time.</p>
<p>This is very, very hard to do, and for some people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost impossible to do,</p>
<p>at least at the outset of grief.</p>
<p>This, in a very neuroscience-y way,</p>
<p>explains this stage that Kubler-Ross described,</p>
<p>which many, again, not all, but many people experience,</p>
<p>which is one of denial.</p>
<p>How could it be?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, when we have a rich catalog of experiences</p>
<p>with somebody or of them, right, ideas about them</p>
<p>and what they do, how they spend their day,</p>
<p>what they do and don&rsquo;t do, where they do it, et cetera,</p>
<p>well, that memory bank is not just flushed out</p>
<p>the moment that we learn that they&rsquo;re no longer with us.</p>
<p>What happens is the brain continues</p>
<p>to make these predictions</p>
<p>that they will be in a certain place or a certain time,</p>
<p>right, that they&rsquo;ll be in a certain time zone</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll walk in the door any moment.</p>
<p>All of those predictions still hold.</p>
<p>The neural activity continues.</p>
<p>We call this reverberatory activity.</p>
<p>That explains the yearning for and the desire to interact,</p>
<p>and yet it&rsquo;s just beyond our reach,</p>
<p>because once they&rsquo;re gone,</p>
<p>our brain still functions in a way,</p>
<p>these neural circuits still function in a way</p>
<p>that put us into an action state of seeking them,</p>
<p>looking for them in the same location,</p>
<p>expecting them to contact us at whatever frequency</p>
<p>that we were used to hearing from them</p>
<p>or that we could reach out to them</p>
<p>and reliably get a response.</p>
<p>It is immensely disorienting, in other words,</p>
<p>to maintain a close attachment and at the same time,</p>
<p>to not be able to make predictions</p>
<p>about where that person, animal, or thing is</p>
<p>in space and time.</p>
<p>Now, if this seems somewhat abstract,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to continue to flush it out.</p>
<p>And actually right now, I&rsquo;d like to flush it out</p>
<p>with a real world example of grief and loss</p>
<p>that comes to us from perhaps one of the greatest minds</p>
<p>in human history and somebody who was intensely grounded</p>
<p>in reality and logic and indeed the physics of the world.</p>
<p>And the person I&rsquo;m referring to is none other</p>
<p>than the Nobel prize-winning physicist, Richard Feynman.</p>
<p>Many of you are probably familiar with Richard Feynman.</p>
<p>Some of you perhaps are not.</p>
<p>Richard Feynman was a Nobel prize-winning physicist</p>
<p>known for his thick New York accent.</p>
<p>He was actually not from Brooklyn,</p>
<p>as many people think.</p>
<p>He was actually from Far Rockaway in Long Island.</p>
<p>Thick New York accent, very personable, exceptional teacher,</p>
<p>brilliant mind, hence the Nobel prize in physics.</p>
<p>Also a quite funny and amusing person,</p>
<p>told great anecdotes, et cetera.</p>
<p>Feynman had a childhood sweetheart</p>
<p>who turned out to be his first wife.</p>
<p>Her name was Arlene.</p>
<p>And it was well-known that Feynman</p>
<p>was absolutely in love with her.</p>
<p>He would talk about her all the time.</p>
<p>She had a profound influence on him and his thinking</p>
<p>and ultimately on his public education efforts later.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already read books</p>
<p>such as Surely You&rsquo;re Joking, Mr. Feynman,</p>
<p>or What Do You Care What Other People Think?</p>
<p>I encourage you to do so.</p>
<p>And in fact, that quote,</p>
<p>what do you care what other people think</p>
<p>is actually a quote, not a Feynman,</p>
<p>but of his first wife, Arlene,</p>
<p>who sadly died at a very young age from tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Why am I sharing Feynman&rsquo;s story of loss of his first bride?</p>
<p>The reason is Feynman continued to write letters to Arlene</p>
<p>for a long period of time.</p>
<p>This is well-known only because after Feynman died,</p>
<p>it was discovered that he kept an archive of letters</p>
<p>to his deceased first wife.</p>
<p>And even though he did eventually marry</p>
<p>and in fact had many relationships with many people,</p>
<p>and I think was married twice more,</p>
<p>maybe it was once, maybe it was twice,</p>
<p>the intensity of his grief,</p>
<p>but also his lack of ability to transition his mind</p>
<p>to a place where he understood that Arlene had died</p>
<p>is one of the more profound examples</p>
<p>of this inability to reconcile the logical world</p>
<p>and the emotional world.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m now going to read to you a letter</p>
<p>that Feynman wrote to Arlene.</p>
<p>This was discovered after Feynman&rsquo;s death</p>
<p>when they went through his desk and his belongings.</p>
<p>And as I read this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to hear some of the typical narrative of grief</p>
<p>that is not unique to Feynman and his dead wife.</p>
<p>But there are also some elements in there</p>
<p>that I think you&rsquo;ll recognize as highlighting</p>
<p>this disbelief and this dissociation</p>
<p>between the reality of somebody&rsquo;s location</p>
<p>and space and time,</p>
<p>and the emotional attachment that they hold for us.</p>
<p>And therein lies the information</p>
<p>about how to better navigate grief.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m reading from the letter.</p>
<p>This was a letter dated October 17th, 1946.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not terribly long, but bear with me.</p>
<p>Dear Arlene, I adore you, sweetheart.</p>
<p>I know how much you like to hear that,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t only write it because you like it.</p>
<p>I write it because it makes me warm all over inside</p>
<p>to write it to you.</p>
<p>It is such a terribly long time since I last wrote to you,</p>
<p>almost two years, but I know you&rsquo;ll excuse me</p>
<p>because you understand how I am, stubborn and realistic.</p>
<p>And I thought there was no sense to writing.</p>
<p>But now I know my darling wife</p>
<p>that it is the right thing to do</p>
<p>what I have delayed in doing,</p>
<p>and that I have done so much in the past.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell you I love you.</p>
<p>I want to love you.</p>
<p>I will always love you.</p>
<p>So here we can hear the intense emotional attachment</p>
<p>that clearly has persisted.</p>
<p>I find it hard to understand in my mind</p>
<p>what it means to love you after you are dead,</p>
<p>but I still want to comfort and take care of you.</p>
<p>And I want you to love me and care for me.</p>
<p>I want to have problems to discuss with you.</p>
<p>I want to do little projects with you.</p>
<p>I never thought until just now that we can do that.</p>
<p>What should we do?</p>
<p>We started to learn to make clothes together</p>
<p>or learn Chinese or getting a movie projector.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t I do something now?</p>
<p>No, I am alone without you.</p>
<p>And you were the idea woman and the general instigator</p>
<p>of all our wild adventures.</p>
<p>When you were sick, you worried</p>
<p>because you could not give me something that you wanted</p>
<p>and you thought I needed.</p>
<p>You needn&rsquo;t have worried.</p>
<p>Just as I told you then there was no real need</p>
<p>because I loved you in so many ways so much.</p>
<p>And now it is clearly even more true.</p>
<p>You can give me nothing now,</p>
<p>yet I love you so that you stand in the way</p>
<p>of my loving anything else.</p>
<p>But I wanted you to stand there.</p>
<p>You dead are so much better than anyone else alive.</p>
<p>So you can really appreciate the depth</p>
<p>and intensity of the attachment.</p>
<p>Despite two years time, it clearly has not waned.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll read the final paragraph now.</p>
<p>I know you will assure me that I am foolish</p>
<p>and that you want me to have full happiness</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t want to be in my way.</p>
<p>I bet you&rsquo;re surprised that I don&rsquo;t even have a girlfriend</p>
<p>except you sweetheart after two years.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t help it darling, nor can I.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand it for I&rsquo;ve met many girls</p>
<p>and very nice ones and I don&rsquo;t want to remain alone.</p>
<p>But in two or three meetings, they all seem ashes.</p>
<p>You only are left to me.</p>
<p>You are real.</p>
<p>My darling wife, I do adore you.</p>
<p>I love my wife.</p>
<p>My wife is dead.</p>
<p>Rich.</p>
<p>PS, please excuse my not mailing this,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know your new address.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot contained in this letter.</p>
<p>We could parse it line by line,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that clearly</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an immense attachment that&rsquo;s been maintained.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s that dimension of closeness of attachment.</p>
<p>Clearly there&rsquo;s an understanding that she&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>In fact, the last line of this love letter</p>
<p>is my wife is dead, right?</p>
<p>He now moves her into the third person in fact,</p>
<p>in that final line.</p>
<p>So he understands this and yet he maintains the attachment</p>
<p>and the very last portion of the letter, the PS,</p>
<p>the postscript, I don&rsquo;t know your new address, right?</p>
<p>Somewhat humorous in the typical vein</p>
<p>of a Feynman writing or speech,</p>
<p>he always had an intensely amusing</p>
<p>and playful sense of humor.</p>
<p>And yet there&rsquo;s something really contained in this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re reading into this too much</p>
<p>in that he doesn&rsquo;t know where to find her.</p>
<p>He feels her as very real</p>
<p>and yet he doesn&rsquo;t know where to find her.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t know her address.</p>
<p>He obviously knows she&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s nowhere to mail it to.</p>
<p>The reason I shared this letter with you,</p>
<p>as opposed to one of the almost infinite number</p>
<p>of other letters that have been written by poets</p>
<p>and authors and scientists and everyday people,</p>
<p>is that it really encapsulates all three dimensions</p>
<p>of attachment and grief.</p>
<p>These notions of space, where is something or somebody?</p>
<p>Time, this dimension of how long would it take me</p>
<p>to reach them or for them to reach me?</p>
<p>What would it take in terms of time to be reunited?</p>
<p>And then that last dimension of closeness.</p>
<p>And the letter beautifully illustrates the fact</p>
<p>that in grief, we maintain that sense of closeness</p>
<p>and yet we have to uncouple it from these other</p>
<p>two dimensions as we&rsquo;re referring to the space and time.</p>
<p>So with this current understanding in mind,</p>
<p>a few things start to become obvious and entirely normal</p>
<p>to us in the best and most healthy sense of the word normal.</p>
<p>For instance, if you&rsquo;ve lost somebody or an animal</p>
<p>or even a thing that was vitally important to you,</p>
<p>it should make perfect sense to you</p>
<p>as to why you keep looking for that person.</p>
<p>I recall this in my own life.</p>
<p>I had the unfortunate circumstance of my graduate advisor,</p>
<p>who I was very close with, died quite young of breast cancer</p>
<p>and her daughter, she has two daughters, kept her cell phone</p>
<p>and would occasionally call me.</p>
<p>I had a quite close relationship to their family.</p>
<p>And when it would come in,</p>
<p>the number would pop up on my phone of not the daughter,</p>
<p>but the name that showed up was of my graduate advisor.</p>
<p>So for years after she died,</p>
<p>my initial impulse when the phone would ring was,</p>
<p>oh my goodness, she&rsquo;s calling.</p>
<p>It was a reflexive excitement</p>
<p>because I truly always enjoyed hearing from her.</p>
<p>She was a wonderful, incredibly wonderful person,</p>
<p>I should say.</p>
<p>Similarly, when somebody passes away,</p>
<p>we will find ourselves looking into a room,</p>
<p>expecting to see them there</p>
<p>or expecting them to knock on the door any moment</p>
<p>or to call on Sunday morning, as it were.</p>
<p>Those expectations, those predictions</p>
<p>that the brain is making are entirely normal</p>
<p>because they are based on that deep catalog</p>
<p>of episodic memory that you maintain about that person.</p>
<p>Again, the depth and richness of that catalog,</p>
<p>scaling, of course, in direct relation</p>
<p>to how close you were with that person, right?</p>
<p>Closer to somebody means more information about them.</p>
<p>More information about them means your brain</p>
<p>has a lot of implicit, unconscious notions</p>
<p>of when and where and how they show up.</p>
<p>So the fact that your brain,</p>
<p>and indeed, sometimes your body reacts</p>
<p>to the expectation that they&rsquo;ll be there is entirely normal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply an activation of this map</p>
<p>that involves closeness, space, and time.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly then, the reordering of that map</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s required in order to move through</p>
<p>the grieving process is going to involve some remapping.</p>
<p>And you as the person grieving have the opportunity</p>
<p>to ask which node, as it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>which element or dimension within that map</p>
<p>are you going to focus on?</p>
<p>Some people really try hard to disengage with</p>
<p>and remap their sense of emotional closeness to the person.</p>
<p>That is, it&rsquo;s so unbelievably overwhelming to them</p>
<p>that the person is no longer accessible,</p>
<p>that they try and change their ideas</p>
<p>about how close they really were.</p>
<p>They try and change their emotional attachment</p>
<p>to the person after they&rsquo;ve died.</p>
<p>Clearly in the example that I gave in the Feynman letter,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>The attachment seems indeed quite fixed</p>
<p>and not going anywhere.</p>
<p>Psychologists and neuroscientists generally agree</p>
<p>that the best way to approach moving through grief</p>
<p>is actually to remap these dimensions</p>
<p>while maintaining the close sense of attachment</p>
<p>to the person by not in any way trying to undermine</p>
<p>the intensity of the attachment</p>
<p>or how important it was to you.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll now talk about how that process works</p>
<p>and the different entry points, as they&rsquo;re called,</p>
<p>to engaging in that process.</p>
<p>So one straightforward way to think about</p>
<p>this state of mind and body that we call grief</p>
<p>is that the idea that someone or an animal or a thing</p>
<p>simply does not exist anymore</p>
<p>is not something that the brain can easily conceptualize.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is that we,</p>
<p>as beings that have a brain,</p>
<p>and a brain, as an organ that makes predictions,</p>
<p>tends to rely more on experience than knowledge.</p>
<p>In other words, the knowledge that someone</p>
<p>or an animal or a thing is gone, that it doesn&rsquo;t exist,</p>
<p>at least not in the dimensionality</p>
<p>that we were accustomed to relating to them in,</p>
<p>is something that we can understand logically,</p>
<p>but that emotionally is very hard to undo,</p>
<p>and from a memory perspective, is very hard to undo.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just that we are in a state</p>
<p>of emotional disbelief.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that we have neurons, literally nerve cells</p>
<p>and neural circuits, connections between nerve cells</p>
<p>that are dedicated to this vast implicit knowledge</p>
<p>of all the things we know about that person,</p>
<p>animal, or thing.</p>
<p>And just because they are no longer in the dimensionality,</p>
<p>meaning in the configuration alive or present in our life</p>
<p>that they were before, doesn&rsquo;t eliminate those memories.</p>
<p>Those memories persist.</p>
<p>And so anytime we call to mind the person&rsquo;s name,</p>
<p>or we call to mind things that remind us of them,</p>
<p>or we suddenly feel the desire to engage with them,</p>
<p>the memories, those episodic implicit memories,</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re called, all that menu and library of knowledge</p>
<p>slams us straight in the face and pushes us into a mode</p>
<p>of wanting to act in a way that&rsquo;s consistent with them</p>
<p>still being here in the way that all that knowledge</p>
<p>told us they were when we acquired it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very long-winded way of saying</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s nothing wrong about the emotional state</p>
<p>when we are in a state of grief.</p>
<p>In fact, quite the opposite.</p>
<p>But there is something wrong about the memories</p>
<p>because the memories are based on our prior knowledge</p>
<p>of them, and those memories actually do not apply</p>
<p>to our current knowledge of them.</p>
<p>And again, even though our brain is a prediction machine</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a very good one, it&rsquo;s not perfect.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s far from perfect.</p>
<p>So really moving through grief is a process</p>
<p>of understanding how relationships are mapped in the brain,</p>
<p>space, time, and closeness, also called attachment,</p>
<p>understanding those three dimensions,</p>
<p>understanding that they are closely linked,</p>
<p>and then understanding that simply the knowledge</p>
<p>that somebody or something or an animal</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t accessible to us does not allow us to discard</p>
<p>of all the knowledge that we have.</p>
<p>And as a consequence,</p>
<p>our brain is constantly generating expectations</p>
<p>of how to access them,</p>
<p>even if we know that&rsquo;s completely irrational.</p>
<p>Now, this should, I would hope,</p>
<p>assist you in moving through grief.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a tool of the sort of like a switch</p>
<p>that you can flip and suddenly not feel grief,</p>
<p>but it does point to a specific set of mechanisms</p>
<p>or a specific set of steps that you can engage</p>
<p>in order to start to move through the grieving process</p>
<p>in the most adaptive and effective way,</p>
<p>and in a way that still holds in mind</p>
<p>your close attachment to the person.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about some of the tools</p>
<p>for adaptively moving through grief.</p>
<p>These are tools gleaned from the research psychology,</p>
<p>the clinical psychology, and the neuroscience literature.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve synthesized my understanding</p>
<p>of those three literatures</p>
<p>to provide the tools that I&rsquo;m about to describe.</p>
<p>The first one involves the acknowledgement</p>
<p>and really the understanding</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t want to disengage</p>
<p>or dismantle your real attachment</p>
<p>to someone, an animal, or a thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a real thing,</p>
<p>and there is actually no adaptive reason</p>
<p>to try and persuade yourself or numb yourself</p>
<p>or somehow avoid the thinking</p>
<p>of just how much they meant to you.</p>
<p>What is important, however,</p>
<p>is that you make some effort to shift your mindset</p>
<p>and your understanding of that person</p>
<p>in a way that holds in mind that,</p>
<p>yes, indeed, the attachment is very real,</p>
<p>and in some cases is very, very intense,</p>
<p>but is now going to be uncoupled</p>
<p>from the other two dimensions of the map,</p>
<p>namely space and time.</p>
<p>So again, just to make absolutely clear,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no reason to try and convince yourself</p>
<p>that you weren&rsquo;t actually that close to this person</p>
<p>or them to you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason to try and reduce the intensity</p>
<p>of that attachment.</p>
<p>To the contrary, you want to anchor yourself</p>
<p>to that attachment,</p>
<p>but you want to make sure that your thoughts</p>
<p>about the person and your feelings about the person</p>
<p>are not oriented toward or in reference to,</p>
<p>I should say, that map,</p>
<p>that deep catalog of memories that you had.</p>
<p>Now, this is not simply a fancy way of saying,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t live in the past.</p>
<p>This is saying you need to maintain</p>
<p>your sense of attachment,</p>
<p>but you need to start making predictions</p>
<p>and understanding about how you&rsquo;re going to engage</p>
<p>with that attachment,</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;re going to feel those things</p>
<p>without the expectation that things</p>
<p>that once happened before are going to happen again.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a complicated process, you can imagine,</p>
<p>but you really want to hold and register two things at once.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like spinning two plates at once,</p>
<p>and therefore it&rsquo;s going to feel like effort.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to set aside</p>
<p>a dedicated period of time of maybe five or 10,</p>
<p>maybe even as much as 30 minutes,</p>
<p>or depending on your capacity, 30 to 45 minutes,</p>
<p>in which you are going to feel deeply</p>
<p>into your closeness and your attachment</p>
<p>to that person, animal, or thing.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re consciously going to try</p>
<p>and prevent yourself from thinking</p>
<p>about a couple of categories of things.</p>
<p>First of all, you want to actively try</p>
<p>and disengage from any attempt to engage</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s called counterfactual thinking, the what-ifs.</p>
<p>What if I had called them a day earlier?</p>
<p>What if they had taken a different route home?</p>
<p>What if I had taken a different route home?</p>
<p>These counterfactual modes of thinking</p>
<p>are an infinite landscape of possibility,</p>
<p>and they are very closely tied to guilt.</p>
<p>Guilt is an interesting emotion.</p>
<p>We should probably do an entire episode about guilt.</p>
<p>But guilt, as defined by psychologists and neuroscientists,</p>
<p>is actually a way of assigning ourselves more agency,</p>
<p>more capability of controlling reality than actually exists.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very slippery slope, and I want to be clear,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the case that guilt</p>
<p>is never an appropriate response,</p>
<p>but in the context of grieving,</p>
<p>guilt is very precarious</p>
<p>because in thinking I could have done this,</p>
<p>or if I had only done that,</p>
<p>you are essentially exploring an infinite landscape</p>
<p>of things that you can never refute.</p>
<p>You will never know that had you not gone down</p>
<p>a different path,</p>
<p>or they had not taken a particular path in life</p>
<p>that things would have turned out different,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t know that it would have worked as well,</p>
<p>meaning you actually don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that your what-ifs are true,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know that they&rsquo;re not true.</p>
<p>And so as an infinite space, it&rsquo;s a very precarious one,</p>
<p>and it will not allow you</p>
<p>to uncouple that intense emotional attachment</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m telling you is actually vital to hold on to</p>
<p>from that catalog of episodic memory that you&rsquo;ve established.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s going to strengthen those bonds.</p>
<p>So in this dedicated five or 10 or 30,</p>
<p>whatever period of time you can tolerate and maintain focus,</p>
<p>the idea is to think about your attachment in a rich way,</p>
<p>and to perhaps even experience that in your brain and body.</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;re in a stage of grief,</p>
<p>that actually will be fairly reflexive to do,</p>
<p>but to try as much as possible</p>
<p>to hold that grief in the present</p>
<p>and to be connected to your immediate physical environment.</p>
<p>So you want to orient yourself in current space and time</p>
<p>rather than focus on memories</p>
<p>or what you would have liked to see happen</p>
<p>or the wish that they were still there,</p>
<p>while at the same time,</p>
<p>thinking about the depth and richness of that attachment.</p>
<p>This is obviously a tightrope walk, so to speak.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an emotionally challenging,</p>
<p>and sometimes even will be experienced</p>
<p>as a physically challenging tool or experience.</p>
<p>But in our understanding of how attachments and grief</p>
<p>are represented in the brain,</p>
<p>this can be an immensely beneficial practice</p>
<p>because it is the first step.</p>
<p>And indeed it represents many of the steps in the voyage</p>
<p>from the initial shock of loss</p>
<p>to our ability to hold in mind somebody</p>
<p>or an animal or a thing in a way</p>
<p>that still allows us to feel the depth</p>
<p>and fullness of connection to them</p>
<p>without feeling the yearning,</p>
<p>that reaching for the glass of water</p>
<p>that unfortunately will never be resolved.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that as you embark on this process,</p>
<p>it is entirely normal for your mind</p>
<p>to flip into various states of expectation,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re suddenly going to be there.</p>
<p>In fact, because of the closeness</p>
<p>of these three dimensions in the map,</p>
<p>space, time, and attachment,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s entirely normal that when you start to think</p>
<p>about your attachment to somebody or an animal or a thing,</p>
<p>that you almost start to experience them</p>
<p>as present in that environment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll share with you a somewhat bizarre,</p>
<p>or it sounds bizarre to articulate out loud,</p>
<p>but many of you perhaps will resonate with this.</p>
<p>For years after my graduate advisor died,</p>
<p>I would get an experience of someone touching the back</p>
<p>of my neck when I would think about her.</p>
<p>And that was not an experience</p>
<p>that I ever had with her, right?</p>
<p>It was a professional relationship.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t ever recall her touching the back of my neck</p>
<p>or me touching the back of my neck in her presence,</p>
<p>at least not on a regular basis.</p>
<p>So it was very perplexing to me.</p>
<p>And then I encountered this incredible literature on grief,</p>
<p>which said the following.</p>
<p>Grief in many ways is like a phantom limb.</p>
<p>For those of you that aren&rsquo;t familiar,</p>
<p>many people who experience amputation of a limb,</p>
<p>either through surgery or accident or otherwise,</p>
<p>will feel in a very genuine way</p>
<p>that the limb is still present,</p>
<p>even though when they look for the limb, it&rsquo;s not there.</p>
<p>So they can feel pain in limbs.</p>
<p>They can feel the sensation of touch.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some famous experiments from the neurologist</p>
<p>and my former colleague at University of California,</p>
<p>San Diego, who goes by his last name, Ramachandran.</p>
<p>Some people just call him Rama.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an incredible scientist</p>
<p>and has done a lot of really important work,</p>
<p>in particular on phantom limb, among other things.</p>
<p>And has done some beautiful experiments</p>
<p>showing that people who have phantom limb pain</p>
<p>or that are experiencing different sensations</p>
<p>in their phantom limb, that can be very intrusive,</p>
<p>much in the same way that expecting someone</p>
<p>to walk through the door who you happen to know is deceased</p>
<p>can be very intrusive.</p>
<p>Ramachandran has done beautiful experiments</p>
<p>showing that if you give people what&rsquo;s called a mirror box,</p>
<p>this is a box in which you insert an intact limb.</p>
<p>And there are some mirrors that give you</p>
<p>the visual impression that the other limb is still present.</p>
<p>And you move the intact limb</p>
<p>and you get a mirror image of the non-existent,</p>
<p>but nonetheless visual image of the phantom limb moving,</p>
<p>that you can resolve some of the pain of a limb</p>
<p>that feels otherwise cramped up.</p>
<p>In other words, the visual perception</p>
<p>can reverse some of these phantom sensations.</p>
<p>In many ways, the phantom limb scenario,</p>
<p>and what I described about a sensation</p>
<p>of being touched on the back of the neck</p>
<p>or this feeling that we have when we engage in the thinking</p>
<p>and the emotions of our attachment</p>
<p>to someone, an animal, or a thing</p>
<p>is very much like a phantom limb,</p>
<p>only it exists in the emotional space.</p>
<p>And it exists because it is reactivation</p>
<p>of these maps about space, time, and person.</p>
<p>And so if the process of moving through grief adaptively</p>
<p>in a healthy way involves maintaining the attachment,</p>
<p>but uncoupling that attachment</p>
<p>from the space and time representation</p>
<p>of that person, animal, or thing that we had before,</p>
<p>well, then the question becomes,</p>
<p>where should we place our expectation of them, right?</p>
<p>Now that of course will vary from person to person.</p>
<p>Some people with particular religious beliefs</p>
<p>will indeed believe that the soul of the person,</p>
<p>the molecules of the person have been reordered</p>
<p>and exist in some sort of either distributed domain, right?</p>
<p>That they are in everything or they are in one location.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not here to speak to that one way or the other.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no good experiment I know</p>
<p>either to prove or disprove that, nor would I want to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the job of science, frankly.</p>
<p>However, allowing ourselves to place notions</p>
<p>of where that person, animal, or thing is</p>
<p>in their current new configuration,</p>
<p>whatever that might be, ashes to ashes, dust to dust,</p>
<p>or that the person&rsquo;s soul comes out of their body.</p>
<p>These are all the different variations that people hear.</p>
<p>Or some people think, well, it&rsquo;s just molecules</p>
<p>and they disintegrate and are reordered</p>
<p>and come up as the plants and the trees.</p>
<p>Again, a near infinite number of possibilities</p>
<p>and it depends a lot on personal belief.</p>
<p>It is however essential that no matter what you believe,</p>
<p>that you have some firm representation</p>
<p>of where that person, animal, or thing is</p>
<p>so that you can plug it into this map,</p>
<p>this three-dimensional map of space, time, and attachment.</p>
<p>The process of moving through grief can&rsquo;t simply be</p>
<p>that we hold onto the attachment and we discard</p>
<p>with any understanding of where they are in space and time.</p>
<p>And actually the letter that Feynman wrote</p>
<p>to his deceased wife, Arlene, again, so beautifully</p>
<p>and really poignantly illustrates the fact</p>
<p>that he doesn&rsquo;t really know where to find her.</p>
<p>On the one hand, he really understands that she&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>And on the other hand, he understands</p>
<p>that he still very much expects her to be there,</p>
<p>that he would like to mail the letter.</p>
<p>But then of course, in this final, somewhat humorous line,</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t know where to send the letter, he tells us.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s very clear and I think is very healthy</p>
<p>is the fact that the emotional bond is still there,</p>
<p>that that is maintained.</p>
<p>And so this tool, if you will, of dedicated blocks of time</p>
<p>for really spending some effort, and it is indeed effort</p>
<p>to access the emotional connection</p>
<p>while starting to uncouple the other nodes of the map,</p>
<p>as it were, is something that is hard.</p>
<p>You should expect it to be hard.</p>
<p>But in terms of the options one has</p>
<p>in order to deal with grief,</p>
<p>it is indeed the most adaptive way to go about it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not trying to avoid thinking about it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not engaging in this counterfactual thinking,</p>
<p>the what if, what if, what if.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not drowning it out with substances or delusion</p>
<p>or with other ways of distracting yourself.</p>
<p>So in that sense, it is truly adaptive.</p>
<p>Now, of course, I don&rsquo;t want to imply</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m a clinical psychologist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly not.</p>
<p>There is absolutely a place for working</p>
<p>with a trained professional to move through grief,</p>
<p>especially these situations,</p>
<p>these one in 10 people who deal with</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called complicated grief or very prolonged grief.</p>
<p>Those are somewhat different things,</p>
<p>but in general point to the fact that there are people</p>
<p>who have an exceptionally hard time moving through grief.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about who those people are</p>
<p>and ways to move through them with or without</p>
<p>a professional to assist you.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, we&rsquo;re starting to understand</p>
<p>on the basis of neuroscience,</p>
<p>what some of the more adaptive and functional ways</p>
<p>of moving through grief are.</p>
<p>In order to really understand how a tool of the sort</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re describing ought to work</p>
<p>and what it&rsquo;s designed to accomplish at a mechanistic level,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to teach you about a very important aspect</p>
<p>of your brain function that has everything to do with grief</p>
<p>and the process of moving through grief,</p>
<p>but has a lot to do with other aspects</p>
<p>of our life experience as well.</p>
<p>Some of you are probably familiar with a brain area</p>
<p>called the hippocampus.</p>
<p>The hippocampus is a structure that&rsquo;s involved</p>
<p>in the formation of new memories,</p>
<p>but not the maintenance of memories.</p>
<p>I discuss the hippocampus in detail in our episode</p>
<p>on memory and our episode with our guest,</p>
<p>Dr. Wendy Suzuki from New York University,</p>
<p>an expert on learning and memory.</p>
<p>During those two discussions,</p>
<p>I did not, however, touch into what the different cell types</p>
<p>are in the hippocampus and the different roles they perform.</p>
<p>And it turns out that there are indeed different cell types</p>
<p>in the hippocampus and they perform very different roles</p>
<p>that are absolutely central to the grief process.</p>
<p>We have cells in our hippocampus,</p>
<p>meaning you have cells in your hippocampus.</p>
<p>These cells are neurons, nerve cells,</p>
<p>that fire anytime, and when we say fire,</p>
<p>I should just remind you, I mean, have electrical activity,</p>
<p>anytime that we enter a particular familiar location.</p>
<p>So for instance, think about your bedroom</p>
<p>and think about where the bed is.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;re doing that,</p>
<p>these so-called place cells are firing,</p>
<p>not necessarily to represent that it&rsquo;s a bed</p>
<p>at that location, but to represent the location itself.</p>
<p>We also have neurons in our hippocampus</p>
<p>and elsewhere in our brain, I should say,</p>
<p>that represent proximity.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you were to wake up</p>
<p>in the middle of the night and walk into the kitchen</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s somewhat dark and you orient toward the sink</p>
<p>to get yourself a glass of water or to the refrigerator</p>
<p>to get yourself something to drink or to eat,</p>
<p>as you get close to the sink or the refrigerator,</p>
<p>there are neurons in your hippocampus</p>
<p>that are going to start engaging electrical activity</p>
<p>because you are in the mere expected proximity</p>
<p>of the sink or refrigerator</p>
<p>and you know where they are, hence the word expected.</p>
<p>Now that all seems fine and good.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got neurons that represent where things are</p>
<p>and sort of goes without saying that those same neurons</p>
<p>map to our emotional attachments.</p>
<p>We generally know where to find our loved ones.</p>
<p>Even if they don&rsquo;t live with us,</p>
<p>we generally know what city they&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>Even if they&rsquo;re traveling,</p>
<p>we generally have a sense of where they&rsquo;re traveling</p>
<p>or the general area in which they&rsquo;re traveling.</p>
<p>Place cells and proximity cells are involved</p>
<p>in that kind of mapping and representations as well.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a third kind of cell</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s particularly important for the sort of tool</p>
<p>that we were talking about earlier,</p>
<p>that tool of holding onto the emotional attachment</p>
<p>to somebody and yet trying to deliberately remap</p>
<p>our understanding of where they are in space and time.</p>
<p>And that has to do with a category of cells</p>
<p>called trace cells.</p>
<p>Trace cells were discovered by a number of laboratories.</p>
<p>I think the most renowned of those is the Moser Laboratory.</p>
<p>The Mosers are a couple, actually, they were a couple.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re now, I think, amicably separated or divorced.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what this episode&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>If I have that wrong, forgive me.</p>
<p>Edward and Brittan are their names.</p>
<p>Their relationship isn&rsquo;t what&rsquo;s important,</p>
<p>except what is important is the work that they did together</p>
<p>in one form or another,</p>
<p>which was very important work establishing</p>
<p>this category of cells in the, not just in the hippocampus,</p>
<p>but in an area of the brain called the entorhinal cortex</p>
<p>that act as a sort of coordinate system</p>
<p>to orient us in space and time.</p>
<p>Trace cells are activated when we expect something</p>
<p>to be at a given location, but it&rsquo;s not there.</p>
<p>Experiments done in their laboratory</p>
<p>and in other laboratories have shown that, for instance,</p>
<p>if you give a rodent or frankly a person a object</p>
<p>that always resides at the same location</p>
<p>and we reach to it in order to access it,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say where your coffee maker is in the morning,</p>
<p>I do a pour over coffee.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m drinking coffee or mate, I&rsquo;ll do a pour over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always more or less in the same location.</p>
<p>And so there are place cells and proximity cells</p>
<p>that relate to my being able to find</p>
<p>that pour over coffee cone thing.</p>
<p>However, if I were to go to that location</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t there, the trace cells,</p>
<p>these neurons in my hippocampus</p>
<p>and an entorhinal cortex and elsewhere,</p>
<p>because again, these cells are connected</p>
<p>by way of circuitry, by way of connections,</p>
<p>those trace cells would fire.</p>
<p>We could even call it a trace circuit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a circuit that has an expectation</p>
<p>that something will be in a location,</p>
<p>but when something is not at that location,</p>
<p>this circuit becomes active.</p>
<p>This is important because what we&rsquo;re talking about here</p>
<p>is a neural circuit and a set of neurons</p>
<p>that are responsible not for the presence of something,</p>
<p>but the absence of something.</p>
<p>We have every reason to believe</p>
<p>based on neuroimaging studies and studies in animal models</p>
<p>that trace cells become very active in the immediate stage</p>
<p>after the loss of a loved one.</p>
<p>That the brain and our maps of the person, place, or thing</p>
<p>that we know cognitively, we understand,</p>
<p>we even believe they are gone.</p>
<p>They are not accessible for whatever reason,</p>
<p>death or otherwise.</p>
<p>And yet we have neurons that are firing</p>
<p>to reveal that absence to us.</p>
<p>And these neurons are closely associated with neurons</p>
<p>that tell us where things ought to be.</p>
<p>So if you feel the expectation,</p>
<p>or you sense that somebody should walk through the door</p>
<p>any moment or call at any moment,</p>
<p>or be next to you when you wake up,</p>
<p>and yet you cognitively understand that they won&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no real reason why they should,</p>
<p>because they are indeed gone, you are not crazy.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s simply a reflection of the normal functioning</p>
<p>of these trace cells and trace circuits.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to consider why two people,</p>
<p>both who are intensely attached to a person</p>
<p>that is no longer there,</p>
<p>can experience the grief of the loss of that person</p>
<p>in such different ways.</p>
<p>This is often observed.</p>
<p>You can have, God forbid, incredibly sadly,</p>
<p>in cases where a child is lost,</p>
<p>where both parents are grieving intensely,</p>
<p>but one seems to feel it at a emotional depth and level</p>
<p>that seems distinct from the other.</p>
<p>Now, of course, keep in mind that we never really know</p>
<p>how other people are feeling.</p>
<p>This is something actually that was raised in the episode</p>
<p>where I interviewed a psychiatrist and researcher colleague</p>
<p>of mine from Stanford, Carl Deisseroth,</p>
<p>as a psychiatrist, I heard him say once</p>
<p>that we really don&rsquo;t know how other people feel.</p>
<p>In fact, a lot of the times</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t even really know how we feel,</p>
<p>or at least describing that</p>
<p>is quite challenging with language often.</p>
<p>And indeed, that is the case.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really know how other people feel.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no clear way of knowing</p>
<p>that the expression someone else has,</p>
<p>or whether or not they&rsquo;re crying or not,</p>
<p>or their body language really represents</p>
<p>how they feel inside.</p>
<p>So that is important to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there does seem to be a sort of a split</p>
<p>among people and indeed among animals as well,</p>
<p>even within a species in terms of how intensely</p>
<p>they feel the yearning aspect of grief.</p>
<p>And it appears based on a number of different lines</p>
<p>of evidence that that relates to this molecule</p>
<p>that some of you have probably heard of, which is oxytocin.</p>
<p>Oxytocin is a hormone slash peptide.</p>
<p>A peptide just means a protein,</p>
<p>generally a small protein.</p>
<p>And a hormone is generally something that functions</p>
<p>at numerous locations in the body</p>
<p>to impact numerous organs and areas of the brain.</p>
<p>So a peptide can be a hormone</p>
<p>and a hormone can be a peptide.</p>
<p>They are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>Oxytocin has a variety of roles in the brain and body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involved in milk let down during lactation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involved in pair bonding, both in males and females.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involved in bonding of parent to child</p>
<p>and indeed between romantic partners, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about some of the animal models that inform us</p>
<p>about the potential roles of oxytocin</p>
<p>in the grieving process.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a species of animal called the prairie vole.</p>
<p>And believe it or not,</p>
<p>the prairie vole has been studied fairly extensively</p>
<p>by neuroscience and psychology researchers.</p>
<p>In fact, our former director of the National Institutes</p>
<p>of Mental Health, Tom Insel,</p>
<p>his laboratory focused quite heavily on prairie voles.</p>
<p>Prairie voles are one species of animal,</p>
<p>but depending on where they live,</p>
<p>you find that some prairie voles are monogamous.</p>
<p>That is, they mate with the same prairie vole for life.</p>
<p>They raise litters of little prairie voles for life.</p>
<p>And other prairie voles,</p>
<p>generally that live in different locations in the wild</p>
<p>are non-monogamous, sometimes called polygamous.</p>
<p>The neurochemical and circuit basis</p>
<p>for this monogamy versus non-monogamy are quite interesting.</p>
<p>However, in the context of grief and attachment,</p>
<p>the prairie voles have taught us a lot.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve taught us a lot</p>
<p>through the following experiment.</p>
<p>Take two prairie voles that are coupled up.</p>
<p>So these would be monogamous prairie voles</p>
<p>that have established a couple-dom.</p>
<p>I guess you would call that a prairie vol-dom, anyway.</p>
<p>Put them in a cage together, they mate together,</p>
<p>they raise young together, and then you separate them.</p>
<p>You literally put a physical barrier</p>
<p>between the two of them,</p>
<p>and you can evaluate how strongly one prairie vole</p>
<p>will work to get access to the other prairie vole, right?</p>
<p>This is sort of the Romeo and Juliet</p>
<p>of prairie vole experiments.</p>
<p>And what you observe is that the monogamous prairie voles</p>
<p>will work very hard to get back to their mate,</p>
<p>to get access to their mate.</p>
<p>They will lever press,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll even walk across a metal plate</p>
<p>that they get an electrical shock.</p>
<p>They will work very, very hard.</p>
<p>They will cross rivers and valleys, if you will,</p>
<p>in the experimental context, that is.</p>
<p>The polygamous prairie voles,</p>
<p>and again, we don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re polyamorous.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what they feel, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re in love</p>
<p>or if they&rsquo;re motivated simply for other things.</p>
<p>But the non-monogamous prairie voles</p>
<p>will not work as hard to access a prairie vole partner.</p>
<p>Now you could argue that&rsquo;s because they expect</p>
<p>that there will be other prairie vole partners,</p>
<p>but even if they&rsquo;ve never experienced</p>
<p>another prairie vole partner,</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t work quite as hard to get back</p>
<p>in connection with this other prairie vole</p>
<p>to mate or otherwise.</p>
<p>This turns out to be interesting</p>
<p>when you start to explore the patterns</p>
<p>of so-called oxytocin receptors in the brain.</p>
<p>To make a long story short,</p>
<p>and to also bridge to the human literature,</p>
<p>it turns out that the monogamous prairie voles</p>
<p>have far more oxytocin receptors in this brain area</p>
<p>that I mentioned earlier, the nucleus accumbens.</p>
<p>And again, to remind you,</p>
<p>the nucleus accumbens is the brain area</p>
<p>associated with motivation, craving, and pursuit.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s as if the monogamous prairie voles</p>
<p>have a capacity to link the attachment circuitry</p>
<p>and the molecules of attachment,</p>
<p>in this case, oxytocin,</p>
<p>to reward pathways and to motivational pathways.</p>
<p>Polygamous, or we should say non-monogamous prairie voles</p>
<p>do as well.</p>
<p>However, they have less oxytocin receptors.</p>
<p>So in other words, non-monogamous prairie voles</p>
<p>seem to have less yearning for attachment overall,</p>
<p>at least to a single individual prairie vole.</p>
<p>And when we look at the human literature</p>
<p>in terms of oxytocin receptor expression</p>
<p>and brain imaging experiments and so on,</p>
<p>what you find is the same.</p>
<p>The people that experience intense grief</p>
<p>and a deep yearning and a motivation</p>
<p>to reconnect with the person, animal, or thing that is lost,</p>
<p>in many cases have heightened levels of oxytocin</p>
<p>specifically, or I should say oxytocin receptors</p>
<p>to be exact,</p>
<p>specifically within the brain regions</p>
<p>associated with craving and pursuit.</p>
<p>So for those of you that find yourself</p>
<p>in this kind of stuck mode,</p>
<p>this persistence of trying to reach into the past</p>
<p>or wishful thinking, this counterfactual thinking,</p>
<p>if only, if only, if only,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t necessarily want to pathologize that thinking.</p>
<p>First of all, we should acknowledge</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not necessarily adaptive.</p>
<p>And in fact, in the complete loss of somebody,</p>
<p>or if somebody says they don&rsquo;t want anything to do</p>
<p>with you ever again, by all means,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s expressed clearly,</p>
<p>then you need to accept that reality.</p>
<p>But the yearning, the desire, and the impulsivity</p>
<p>that kind of leaning in at a almost reflexive way</p>
<p>to try and access that person again,</p>
<p>to text them, to want to hear from them could,</p>
<p>and I have to highlight could reflect the fact</p>
<p>that you just so happen to have more oxytocin receptors</p>
<p>or maybe more oxytocin overall in this brain area</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s associated with motivation and pursuit.</p>
<p>It does not necessarily mean</p>
<p>that you are more capable of attachment</p>
<p>than people who move through grief more quickly.</p>
<p>And I should say that people move through grief</p>
<p>at different rates,</p>
<p>even if two people lost the same person or same animal,</p>
<p>people move through this at different rates.</p>
<p>And some of that is no doubt psychological,</p>
<p>but some of it no doubt is also neurochemical</p>
<p>and biological.</p>
<p>And in sharing this with you,</p>
<p>I hope it shed some understanding</p>
<p>and perhaps even some compassion</p>
<p>for people who are moving through things more quickly</p>
<p>or in a different way.</p>
<p>And of course it should also, I would hope,</p>
<p>shed compassion and understanding</p>
<p>for people that seem incapable of quote unquote moving on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taking them far longer to move on.</p>
<p>Earlier, we talked about complicated grief,</p>
<p>non-complicated grief, and prolonged grief disorder.</p>
<p>And I should say that the precise divisions</p>
<p>between these categories is not very precise.</p>
<p>It takes a really trained expert to be able to identify</p>
<p>whether or not somebody is in</p>
<p>the prolonged grief disorder category,</p>
<p>complicated or non-complicated grief.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a set of questionnaires</p>
<p>that I invite you to answer if you like.</p>
<p>They were provided, or I should say I accessed them</p>
<p>through a public site on Mary Frances O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s webpage.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll put them in the show note captions.</p>
<p>You actually can submit those answers in an anonymous way</p>
<p>to a study that she&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>She has several surveys,</p>
<p>one for loss of a romantic relationship,</p>
<p>other for loss due to death of somebody,</p>
<p>and still another one that relates to homesickness.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also available in several different languages.</p>
<p>So I provide a link to that website.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to download.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no cost to that at all.</p>
<p>You can contribute to the scientific data collection process</p>
<p>if you like.</p>
<p>And I do believe that you get your scores back</p>
<p>or an interpretation of your scores by participating there.</p>
<p>When Mary Frances O&rsquo;Connor hopefully comes on the podcast,</p>
<p>she can tell us some more of the detail</p>
<p>about separating out this prolonged grief disorder,</p>
<p>complicated and non-complicated grief.</p>
<p>But in the meantime,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very clear that people move through grief</p>
<p>at different rates.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned just a moment ago</p>
<p>that this is entirely normal,</p>
<p>probably has a basis in neurochemicals</p>
<p>and hormones such as oxytocin.</p>
<p>There are probably other reasons as well.</p>
<p>In fact, we can assume with almost certainty</p>
<p>that there are other reasons as well.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I think it is really important to think about</p>
<p>why some people might have a harder time</p>
<p>moving through grief due to life circumstance,</p>
<p>innate differences, and so on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very nice set of studies,</p>
<p>but one in particular entitled</p>
<p>Catecholamine Predictors of Complicated Grief Outcomes.</p>
<p>Here again, the first author is Mary Frances O&rsquo;Connor,</p>
<p>reminding us that she&rsquo;s done so much important work</p>
<p>in this area.</p>
<p>This paper has several conclusions,</p>
<p>but one of the key conclusions</p>
<p>is that this particular category of molecules</p>
<p>we call the catecholamines.</p>
<p>The catecholamines include epinephrine,</p>
<p>which is also adrenaline,</p>
<p>norepinephrine, which is noradrenaline,</p>
<p>and dopamine, which you&rsquo;ve learned about before.</p>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;m just going to paraphrase</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ll read directly actually.</p>
<p>What they found was that participants,</p>
<p>again, this is human subjects,</p>
<p>with the highest levels of epinephrine,</p>
<p>of adrenaline pretreatment,</p>
<p>had the highest levels of complicated grief symptoms</p>
<p>post-treatment, and that could account</p>
<p>for their baseline level of symptoms.</p>
<p>What this means is that people</p>
<p>that have a lot of circulating adrenaline,</p>
<p>we might even call these people who are,</p>
<p>or typically reside at a higher level of autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>We have an autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>that dictates how calm or alert or stressed</p>
<p>we happen to be just at baseline.</p>
<p>People who tend to be more alert and anxious at baseline,</p>
<p>prior to any grief episode,</p>
<p>tend to have, or statistically, on average, we should say,</p>
<p>are more likely to experience complicated grief</p>
<p>and maybe even prolonged grief symptoms.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody that is anticipating losing someone</p>
<p>or an animal or a thing at some point,</p>
<p>and I think that really means everybody,</p>
<p>utilizing tools to adjust your epinephrine,</p>
<p>your adrenaline levels down,</p>
<p>has a number of important benefits,</p>
<p>improving sleep, health metrics, et cetera.</p>
<p>There are tools to do that.</p>
<p>We have an episode on mastering stress</p>
<p>that you can find at our website, humorinlab.com.</p>
<p>It has a lot of behavioral tools that are backed by science,</p>
<p>some of work that was done in my laboratory,</p>
<p>but certainly other laboratories as well,</p>
<p>that will allow you to control</p>
<p>your autonomic nervous system, both in real time,</p>
<p>and reduce the overall level of stress</p>
<p>and even chronic activation of the so-called sympathetic arm</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>which is just fancy geek speak for saying</p>
<p>there are tools to help you be calm,</p>
<p>not just for sake of navigating daily stress,</p>
<p>but as this paper illustrates,</p>
<p>for anticipating the fact that at some point</p>
<p>you will lose somebody, an animal or a thing.</p>
<p>And there is a way to move through that process</p>
<p>that we call healthy, normal grieving.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the so-called complicated grief</p>
<p>or prolonged grief disorders that reflect immense challenge</p>
<p>in moving through grief at a reasonable rate.</p>
<p>So you can somewhat inoculate yourself</p>
<p>against complicated or prolonged grief</p>
<p>by reducing your resting levels of,</p>
<p>or your pre-loss levels of epinephrine, of adrenaline.</p>
<p>And again, there are excellent tools to do that.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t review them here for sake of time,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re timestamped and you can access those easily.</p>
<p>Again, zero cost tools.</p>
<p>Going back to this paper,</p>
<p>catecholamine predictors</p>
<p>of complicated grief treatment outcomes</p>
<p>should say that not only did participants</p>
<p>with the highest levels of adrenaline</p>
<p>have the highest levels of complicated grief symptoms</p>
<p>post-treatment,</p>
<p>but the predictive relationship between these two things,</p>
<p>adrenaline and complicated grief,</p>
<p>was not seen in depression.</p>
<p>And I find that incredibly interesting</p>
<p>because it further separates depression from grieving</p>
<p>and grieving from depression.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a resounding theme again and again.</p>
<p>Grieving is not depression</p>
<p>and depression is not necessarily grieving.</p>
<p>They can coexist, but they are separable as well.</p>
<p>And indeed reflect separate brain circuitries entirely.</p>
<p>So the conclusion they draw</p>
<p>is that the present study supports the hypothesis</p>
<p>that catecholamine levels,</p>
<p>again, epinephrine, dopamine, norepinephrine,</p>
<p>are the catecholamines,</p>
<p>are affected by bereavement</p>
<p>and in turn can affect the ability of those</p>
<p>with complicated grief to benefit from psychotherapy.</p>
<p>So what does all this mean?</p>
<p>What this means is we can prepare ourselves</p>
<p>to be in a better state to access,</p>
<p>yes, access grief when it&rsquo;s appropriate.</p>
<p>And indeed grief is the appropriate response</p>
<p>when we lose someone, an animal or a thing</p>
<p>that we are closely attached to.</p>
<p>And yet to be able to move through that at a pace</p>
<p>and in a way that is most adaptive for us.</p>
<p>And to just again, highlight what adaptive means.</p>
<p>It does not mean dissociating from the attachment</p>
<p>to the person, animal, or thing.</p>
<p>I just want to pause for a second</p>
<p>and mention why I keep repeating person, animal, or thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that because while grieving the loss of a person</p>
<p>or a relationship with a person,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to be through death, of course,</p>
<p>but death or otherwise,</p>
<p>is something that we all can intuitively understand</p>
<p>even if we haven&rsquo;t experienced it.</p>
<p>We are capable of achieving great attachments</p>
<p>to animals as well.</p>
<p>And while the loss of a thing, of an object</p>
<p>in no way, shape, or form approximates the loss</p>
<p>of a person or an animal,</p>
<p>I would never suggest that it does.</p>
<p>It would also be naive and unfair of me or anyone else</p>
<p>to suggest that things can&rsquo;t hold immense importance to us</p>
<p>and that the loss of them can feel quite significant</p>
<p>and invoke the grieving process.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t always about materialism.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s purely about the sentimental attachment.</p>
<p>So for instance, the loss of a wedding ring</p>
<p>or an engagement ring that was very meaningful to you</p>
<p>or an article of clothing or a painting</p>
<p>or even a small seemingly inimportant object</p>
<p>to somebody else,</p>
<p>but something that held great meaning to you,</p>
<p>maybe a seashell that you collected with somebody</p>
<p>on the beach, and then somehow it gets lost.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the relationship with that person</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s contained within that object for you</p>
<p>as a representation within that object that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reason why I keep saying</p>
<p>person, animal, or thing.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s only fair to include things in that category.</p>
<p>But of course, with the understanding</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t hold the absolute same magnitude</p>
<p>as the loss of a being.</p>
<p>One thing that we ought to consider for a moment</p>
<p>is whether or not the depth of attachment</p>
<p>that you have to somebody predicts</p>
<p>how long it will take for you to move through</p>
<p>the loss of that person.</p>
<p>We often hear this.</p>
<p>Actually, I can remember some years ago</p>
<p>at the end of a relationship,</p>
<p>a friend and colleague of mine saying,</p>
<p>for every year that you were together,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to take you one month to get over that person.</p>
<p>And I thought, well, where in the world</p>
<p>do those data come from?</p>
<p>And this is what I call anic data or collective data</p>
<p>where this is like phrases such as,</p>
<p>absence makes the heart grow fonder.</p>
<p>And indeed, sometimes absence can make the heart grow fonder</p>
<p>in the context of two living people</p>
<p>or people in a loving relationship,</p>
<p>or even in the context of grief and loss.</p>
<p>But of course, there&rsquo;s absence makes the heart grow fonder.</p>
<p>And then you also will hear out of sight, out of mind.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve been listening to this episode,</p>
<p>clearly out of sight does not mean out of mind</p>
<p>or out of emotional connection.</p>
<p>So these sayings of,</p>
<p>well, it takes X number of months for a number of years,</p>
<p>or out of sight, out of mind,</p>
<p>or absence makes the heart grow fonder.</p>
<p>They really don&rsquo;t hold a lot of meaning,</p>
<p>at least not for somebody like me who likes science</p>
<p>because science is at least geared toward</p>
<p>or aims towards establishing things in fact, not opinion,</p>
<p>but also because science allows you to make predictions.</p>
<p>It allows you to orient yourself in a process</p>
<p>and make predictions and understand.</p>
<p>So what are we to think of people</p>
<p>who seem very, very attached to somebody,</p>
<p>they break up and they seem just crushed, devastated,</p>
<p>but three weeks later they&rsquo;re in a new relationship</p>
<p>and they seem perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Or somebody whose spouse dies</p>
<p>and then suddenly they&rsquo;re in a new relationship.</p>
<p>I think there are rates of transition, if you will,</p>
<p>that suggests some dysfunction, pathology, et cetera.</p>
<p>But here we aren&rsquo;t in a position to judge,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re only in a position to speculate about this.</p>
<p>And I think we can reasonably speculate</p>
<p>that it sort of makes sense</p>
<p>why someone who has an intense attachment to somebody</p>
<p>might be able to form a tense attachments generally, right?</p>
<p>That they aren&rsquo;t restricted to one person,</p>
<p>whereas other people who have an intense attachment</p>
<p>to somebody might find themselves entirely incapable</p>
<p>of moving on, or it would take them a very long time.</p>
<p>Hence the lines in the Feynman letter to Arlene</p>
<p>about he had met various other young women,</p>
<p>they seemed perfectly nice,</p>
<p>and yet they were meaningless to him</p>
<p>in the shadow of her memory,</p>
<p>or we should say in the light of Arlene&rsquo;s memory</p>
<p>or the memory of Arlene rather.</p>
<p>So these dimensionalities of attachment,</p>
<p>they cut in every direction.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think any well-trained psychologist</p>
<p>or neuroscientists would ever say,</p>
<p>oh, if you are somebody who becomes very attached,</p>
<p>therefore it&rsquo;s very hard to move on.</p>
<p>I think that could be true.</p>
<p>It could also be that if you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>who has a great capacity for attachment,</p>
<p>you have a great capacity for attachment overall.</p>
<p>Neuroscience nor psychology is really in a position</p>
<p>to judge certainly,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also not in a position</p>
<p>to make those kinds of predictions.</p>
<p>At least the field as it stands right now</p>
<p>of attachment and grieving</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t really speak to why that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my attempt to depathologize</p>
<p>some of what we observe.</p>
<p>Although I have to confess from a just sort of</p>
<p>everyday stance that sometimes the rate</p>
<p>in which people move out of attachments and grieving</p>
<p>can be somewhat eerie.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a moment and explore this idea</p>
<p>that allowing ourselves to really feel the attachment</p>
<p>to somebody can accelerate</p>
<p>or at least support adaptive transitioning</p>
<p>through grief.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a really wonderful study that on the face of it</p>
<p>appears to be a, what we call negative result.</p>
<p>A negative result is when a hypothesis is posed</p>
<p>and then turns out the hypothesis is not true.</p>
<p>But as is the case with so many</p>
<p>interesting scientific findings,</p>
<p>often when there&rsquo;s a negative result,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a more interesting result nested</p>
<p>in that negative outcome.</p>
<p>And this is the case in a particular paper</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll share with you now.</p>
<p>This is a paper published in the journal</p>
<p>Biological Psychology.</p>
<p>And again, the title is posed as a question,</p>
<p>which is emotional disclosure for whom?</p>
<p>A study of vagal tone in bereavement.</p>
<p>What this study explored was whether or not</p>
<p>written disclosure of the emotional connection</p>
<p>to somebody that was lost would be effective</p>
<p>as a way for people to move through the grieving process.</p>
<p>The study also explored the so-called vagus nerve.</p>
<p>The vagus nerve is an extensive nerve pathway</p>
<p>that is bi-directional between brain and body.</p>
<p>So brain to body and body to brain.</p>
<p>It generally is associated with calming effects</p>
<p>on our brain and body,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s certainly not always the case.</p>
<p>The way to think about it in terms of</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re going to talk about now</p>
<p>is heart rate and heart rate variability.</p>
<p>And in very simplistic terms,</p>
<p>if your heart was just allowed to beat</p>
<p>at its sort of default rate,</p>
<p>that rate would be rather high</p>
<p>because of the activation of the so-called sympathetic arm</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>the alertness component of the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>The parasympathetic nervous system, as it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>involves calming.</p>
<p>We sometimes hear sympathetic is for stress</p>
<p>or fight or flight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for a lot of other things as well, I should mention,</p>
<p>and is not for sympathy.</p>
<p>Sympa simply means together,</p>
<p>and it reflects the activity of a bunch of neurons</p>
<p>being active at the same time or together, sympa.</p>
<p>Whereas parasympathetic is often associated with</p>
<p>quote-unquote rest and digest functions</p>
<p>or calming functions,</p>
<p>although it is certainly involved in other things as well.</p>
<p>So sympathetic nervous system drives alertness,</p>
<p>panic, stress, et cetera.</p>
<p>Parasympathetic nervous system,</p>
<p>meaning a distinct set of neurons,</p>
<p>drive calming, falling asleep, digestion,</p>
<p>sexual arousal for that matter, and so on.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of like a seesaw of alertness and calm,</p>
<p>alertness and calm,</p>
<p>sympathetic and parasympathetic, back and forth.</p>
<p>The vagus nerve is generally associated</p>
<p>with parasympathetic functions</p>
<p>and has the capacity to slow down our heart rate,</p>
<p>in particular by exhales.</p>
<p>And just simply because of the movement of the diaphragm</p>
<p>and its relationship to the heart and the thoracic cavity,</p>
<p>exhales result in slowing down of the heart rate.</p>
<p>This is what we call an increased vagal tone.</p>
<p>So let me explain for a moment.</p>
<p>And actually here&rsquo;s a tool you can use,</p>
<p>not just in terms of navigating grief,</p>
<p>but in terms of stress modulation generally.</p>
<p>We have a muscle called the diaphragm.</p>
<p>When we inhale, whether or not it&rsquo;s through our mouth</p>
<p>or our nose, our diaphragm moves down.</p>
<p>As a consequence, there is more space overall</p>
<p>in the thoracic cavity.</p>
<p>The heart gets a little bit bigger,</p>
<p>believe it or not, volume-wise.</p>
<p>Blood flows more slowly through that large volume.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a signal conveyed from the nervous system</p>
<p>to the heart to speed the heart up.</p>
<p>So inhales literally speed your heart up.</p>
<p>And when you exhale, the diaphragm moves up.</p>
<p>And as a consequence,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s less space in the thoracic cavity.</p>
<p>Heart gets a little bit smaller.</p>
<p>The existing blood volume in the heart at that time</p>
<p>moves more quickly through that small volume, right?</p>
<p>Given amount of blood volume,</p>
<p>make the compartment that&rsquo;s in the heart smaller</p>
<p>and the blood moves more quickly through that volume.</p>
<p>And as a consequence of the nervous system</p>
<p>sends a signal to the heart via the vagus</p>
<p>and other pathways to slow the heart down.</p>
<p>In other words, exhales slow the heart down.</p>
<p>That process, that relationship</p>
<p>between inhale speeding the heart up</p>
<p>and exhale slowing the heart down</p>
<p>is something called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.</p>
<p>Some people are able to engage</p>
<p>respiratory sinus arrhythmia more naturally,</p>
<p>more reflexively than others.</p>
<p>You can actually train this by consciously thinking about</p>
<p>slowing your heart rate while you exhale</p>
<p>and consciously thinking about increasing your heart rate</p>
<p>as you inhale.</p>
<p>You can literally strengthen these pathways.</p>
<p>Now, respiratory sinus arrhythmia</p>
<p>and the ability to slow your heart rate with exhales</p>
<p>is one dimension of what&rsquo;s called vagal tone</p>
<p>or your ability to control your overall level</p>
<p>of activation of alertness and stress</p>
<p>with these vagus nerve pathways.</p>
<p>So vagal tone is something that varies</p>
<p>from person to person.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve trained up or you&rsquo;ve thought about</p>
<p>your relationship between breath and heart rate,</p>
<p>you can improve vagal tone.</p>
<p>Some people have very robust vagal tone</p>
<p>without having done any training.</p>
<p>Other people have less of it, et cetera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just paraphrase from this paper</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll see where this takes us</p>
<p>in terms of navigating grief because it&rsquo;s quite important.</p>
<p>The vagus nerve provides inhibitory regulatory influence</p>
<p>on the heart, allowing the heart rate to increase rapidly</p>
<p>through vagal withdrawal.</p>
<p>That means kind of coming off the brake</p>
<p>of the parasympathetic nervous system</p>
<p>as in response to a stressor in one&rsquo;s environment, right?</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re stressed, you rarely take the opportunity</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s an immediate stress or threat to actively exhale.</p>
<p>That would be a great tool to use.</p>
<p>And in fact, we promote that tool</p>
<p>in our mastering stress episode.</p>
<p>Vagal withdrawal usually co-occurs with an increase</p>
<p>in sympathetic activation of the heart.</p>
<p>You now know what that is,</p>
<p>or is known as the fight or flight response.</p>
<p>Vagal tone reflects the degree to which there is tonic,</p>
<p>meaning ongoing vagal influence on the heart.</p>
<p>So when you have a high degree of vagal tone,</p>
<p>it means that you are always activating that brake</p>
<p>on your stress system, just at default.</p>
<p>And some people just happen to do that more.</p>
<p>Other people need to practice long exhale breathing</p>
<p>in order to build up vagal tone,</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s very useful to do</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re grieving or not.</p>
<p>Now, in this study, what they did is they had people,</p>
<p>and I should say it was 35 participants,</p>
<p>go through a writing exercise for a period of weeks.</p>
<p>They actually wrote about three times per week.</p>
<p>Then there was a follow-up at some period of time.</p>
<p>And then again, about a month later,</p>
<p>and there were two different groups.</p>
<p>One group was in the so-called written disclosure group.</p>
<p>What they did is they, on day one,</p>
<p>they would write about what happened when a loved one died.</p>
<p>And indeed they used people who had experienced real loss.</p>
<p>And so they were asked to talk about</p>
<p>and write about their deepest emotions</p>
<p>and thoughts about it, memories of their loved one,</p>
<p>very intense stuff if you think about it,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re in the immediate period of having lost someone.</p>
<p>Then they actually were asked to write a letter</p>
<p>to the person that they lost.</p>
<p>So again, a very intense exercise to go through</p>
<p>if you did indeed lose somebody as these subjects had.</p>
<p>And then of course there was the testing</p>
<p>some period of time later.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you what that period,</p>
<p>what that testing involved.</p>
<p>The other group was a so-called control group</p>
<p>where they were simply told to write</p>
<p>about how they use their time.</p>
<p>So an emotionally kind of empty writing exercise,</p>
<p>if you will.</p>
<p>They described what they would do today</p>
<p>after they woke up, et cetera.</p>
<p>No heavy emotional content and so on.</p>
<p>Now, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>the immediate results of this study</p>
<p>were a negative result, meaning no effect.</p>
<p>The disclosure that we should say</p>
<p>the emotionally intense writing group</p>
<p>and the control group did not differ at baseline</p>
<p>on any symptom measures</p>
<p>or psychological variables they tell us.</p>
<p>And at least at face value, somewhat disappointingly,</p>
<p>there really wasn&rsquo;t any kind of difference in outcome</p>
<p>between the group that wrote</p>
<p>about a very emotionally intense stuff</p>
<p>versus non-emotionally intense.</p>
<p>Now, what I didn&rsquo;t tell you thus far</p>
<p>is why they had them do this exercise at all.</p>
<p>They had them do this exercise</p>
<p>because many of the effective practices</p>
<p>for moving through grief involve, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>getting close to and actually deliberately experiencing</p>
<p>the attachment that one has to that person that was lost.</p>
<p>Not distracting oneself,</p>
<p>not getting into this counterfactual thinking,</p>
<p>the what if, what if, what if,</p>
<p>but rather thinking about, or in this case,</p>
<p>writing about the real attachment.</p>
<p>And so the initial idea was</p>
<p>if people write about this attachment,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to experience this attachment</p>
<p>and that will serve them in some or many ways</p>
<p>in terms of moving through grief.</p>
<p>And that wasn&rsquo;t what they found.</p>
<p>They found no difference between the two groups</p>
<p>until they explored who had higher vagal tone,</p>
<p>who had a greater degree</p>
<p>of so-called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.</p>
<p>In other words, who was able to modulate their state</p>
<p>using their breathing and their body.</p>
<p>And what they discovered was that a subset of individuals</p>
<p>who had a high degree of vagal tone</p>
<p>seemed to get more benefit from this writing type exercise.</p>
<p>Now this is one study,</p>
<p>and I would consider it fairly preliminary</p>
<p>with 35 subjects.</p>
<p>Although, you know, it&rsquo;s a study unto itself</p>
<p>and I think a quite nice one.</p>
<p>And it really set the stage</p>
<p>for a number of other studies that followed</p>
<p>from this group and other groups</p>
<p>that really point to the fact that yes, indeed,</p>
<p>accessing these states of emotionality</p>
<p>by writing or thinking about somebody is quite powerful</p>
<p>in terms of engaging the bodily states</p>
<p>and the mind states associated with the attachment.</p>
<p>And that is very beneficial for moving through grief.</p>
<p>That is very beneficial for sensing the attachment.</p>
<p>And now it makes perfect sense</p>
<p>as to why some people would benefit</p>
<p>from that sort of practice more than others,</p>
<p>because some people are able to access</p>
<p>more real somatic feelings of attachment</p>
<p>by writing about the attachment</p>
<p>or by thinking about it than others.</p>
<p>So this brings us back to an earlier discussion</p>
<p>we were having where we were talking about</p>
<p>how some people seem to move through things very quickly</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t seem to be grieving constantly.</p>
<p>And, you know, a spouse or a family member of that person</p>
<p>might think, gosh, why aren&rsquo;t you upset?</p>
<p>How is it that you can be functional and I&rsquo;m not?</p>
<p>Or how is it that you can be functional?</p>
<p>There can even be fractures in families and relationships</p>
<p>on the basis of differences in rates of grieving and so on.</p>
<p>Well, some of this, again, probably relates to psychology</p>
<p>and the different attachments that people had</p>
<p>to the person or animal or thing that was lost,</p>
<p>but it no doubt also has to do</p>
<p>with how much of a mind-body connection,</p>
<p>how much of vagal tone exists in the person</p>
<p>when they suddenly found themselves in the grief episode.</p>
<p>So this actually offers multiple opportunities.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody, for instance,</p>
<p>who is grieving so intensely and so often</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re finding it immensely difficult</p>
<p>to move through grief at a reasonable rate,</p>
<p>and you might even say, or find yourself diagnosed</p>
<p>with prolonged grief disorder</p>
<p>or with complicated grief syndrome in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really impairing your adaptive functioning in life.</p>
<p>Well, then it&rsquo;s not clear to me,</p>
<p>at least by my read of the data,</p>
<p>that you would want to engage in a lot of practices</p>
<p>to increase the mind-body relationship</p>
<p>and feeling so much of this attachment</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re already feeling an immense amount of it.</p>
<p>Whereas other people who are feeling challenged</p>
<p>in accessing the feelings of attachment</p>
<p>and perhaps not functioning well as a consequence of that</p>
<p>might find that practicing breathing</p>
<p>in order to encourage respiratory signs of arrhythmia,</p>
<p>again, focusing on slowing your heart rate consciously</p>
<p>while you exhale and concentrating</p>
<p>on increasing your heart rate as you inhale,</p>
<p>even just as a brief practice</p>
<p>of even just one to three minutes</p>
<p>or one to five minutes every once in a while or per day,</p>
<p>that could be immensely beneficial</p>
<p>in building this mind-body relationship.</p>
<p>Because again, what this paper really points to</p>
<p>and set off a number of other investigations related to</p>
<p>is that for those that can really feel the relationship</p>
<p>between breathing, heart rate, what we call vagal tone,</p>
<p>well, those people are going to be in a better position</p>
<p>to move through grief,</p>
<p>not because they are disengaging</p>
<p>from the feelings of attachment,</p>
<p>but because they are better able to access</p>
<p>those feelings of attachment.</p>
<p>So what this relates to, of course,</p>
<p>is that tripartite map,</p>
<p>that three-part map that we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>that representation of space, where things are,</p>
<p>where the person is, where their belongings are,</p>
<p>where their car is, where their bicycle is,</p>
<p>time, when you were expecting to see them on a regular basis,</p>
<p>when they would call,</p>
<p>when they would come home from work, et cetera.</p>
<p>And that third node or that third dimension of attachment,</p>
<p>which is literally attachment and closeness.</p>
<p>Well, what we&rsquo;re talking about here</p>
<p>is anchoring to that attachment</p>
<p>and really feeling into that,</p>
<p>but then disengaging from the space and time map</p>
<p>that we call episodic memory,</p>
<p>that menu of prior experiences</p>
<p>that keeps us in many ways maladaptively</p>
<p>in an expectation of what never can be again.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to take a moment</p>
<p>and consider some of the tools that you can access</p>
<p>that support healthy transitioning through grief.</p>
<p>And these are tools distinct from that neural map,</p>
<p>that space-time-closeness attachment map</p>
<p>that we were talking about before.</p>
<p>Rather, it&rsquo;s important to remind ourselves</p>
<p>that everything exists in a context</p>
<p>of our baseline physiology.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m certainly not going to be the first or the last</p>
<p>to tell you that everything in life,</p>
<p>learning, relationships with people that are still around,</p>
<p>our health in every way, immune system, et cetera,</p>
<p>function far better when we&rsquo;re sleeping really well</p>
<p>and when we are generally awake during the daytime</p>
<p>and asleep at night.</p>
<p>I realize there are shift workers out there,</p>
<p>people who are traveling and are jet lagged.</p>
<p>First of all, thank you, shift workers, we rely on you.</p>
<p>We have an episode all about jet lag and shift work for you</p>
<p>and for trying to maintain the best possible mental</p>
<p>and physical health in the face of ongoing shift work</p>
<p>and jet lag.</p>
<p>You can find that episode on our website, hubramlab.com.</p>
<p>Lots of behavioral tools, some other tools as well.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, human beings are diurnal.</p>
<p>We were really designed to be awake mostly in the day</p>
<p>and asleep at night.</p>
<p>There are rare exceptions to this</p>
<p>where people like to stay up late and sleep in late,</p>
<p>but we are a diurnal species by way of our genetic wiring</p>
<p>and our neural circuit wiring.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a particular feature to our diurnal,</p>
<p>diurnal meaning the opposite of nocturnal,</p>
<p>our diurnal pattern of the release of a hormone</p>
<p>called cortisol.</p>
<p>Cortisol is a stress hormone, it&rsquo;s sometimes called,</p>
<p>but cortisol has a lot of other effects,</p>
<p>many of which are positive.</p>
<p>Cortisol, for instance, protects us against infection.</p>
<p>It can help us in terms of waking up in the morning.</p>
<p>In fact, the pulse as it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>or the spike in cortisol early in the day</p>
<p>is part of the reason we wake up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s linked to our increase in temperature rhythms</p>
<p>and can further increase our temperature,</p>
<p>which leads to waking and so on.</p>
<p>The typical pattern of cortisol in a healthy individual,</p>
<p>and we really can say physically</p>
<p>and emotionally healthy individual,</p>
<p>is that cortisol is going to be somewhat high</p>
<p>right around waking,</p>
<p>and then is going to be highest</p>
<p>as it ever will be in the 24 hour period,</p>
<p>about 45 minutes post waking,</p>
<p>not exactly 45 minutes, but about 45 minutes.</p>
<p>And then it will drop gradually</p>
<p>such that by about 4 p.m. in the afternoon,</p>
<p>which is actually when body temperature</p>
<p>tends to start to drop as well,</p>
<p>cortisol tends to be very low</p>
<p>and then remains low in a healthy individual</p>
<p>such that at 9 p.m. it&rsquo;s very low,</p>
<p>and throughout the night as we sleep, it&rsquo;s very low.</p>
<p>In fact, spikes or pulses in 9 p.m. cortisol</p>
<p>are a fairly reliable biomarker readout</p>
<p>of certain forms of depression and chronic anxiety.</p>
<p>This relates to the beautiful work</p>
<p>of my colleagues at Stanford and Stanford School of Medicine,</p>
<p>Dr. David Spiegel, who&rsquo;s been on this podcast,</p>
<p>and Dr. Robert Sapolsky, who has also been on this podcast.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very interesting paper</p>
<p>exploring the relationship between cortisol rhythms</p>
<p>and grieving, in particular,</p>
<p>complicated versus non-complicated grieving.</p>
<p>Again, complicated grieving being the form of grieving</p>
<p>that reflects a immense challenge</p>
<p>of people moving through the grieving process</p>
<p>such that it really needs to be dealt with, right?</p>
<p>Again, grieving is healthy,</p>
<p>but complicated grieving is a prolonged grieving</p>
<p>and has other dimensions as well,</p>
<p>hence the name complicated.</p>
<p>The title of this paper is</p>
<p>Diurnal Cortisol in Complicated and Non-Complicated Grief,</p>
<p>Slope Differences Across the Day.</p>
<p>And the figure to orient to in this paper,</p>
<p>if you do decide to check it out,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll put a link to it,</p>
<p>is figure one, which beautifully shows,</p>
<p>or I should say very clearly shows</p>
<p>that in individuals that are experiencing complicated grief,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the same general contour</p>
<p>of high cortisol upon waking,</p>
<p>even higher about 45 minutes after waking,</p>
<p>and then a reduction in cortisol by 4 p.m.</p>
<p>and even further reduction by 9 p.m.</p>
<p>So just as it were in a typical individual</p>
<p>or somebody who is in non-complicated grieving.</p>
<p>However, when you compare the cortisol levels</p>
<p>between people experiencing complicated grieving</p>
<p>versus non-complicated grieving,</p>
<p>what you find is the 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. cortisol levels</p>
<p>are significantly higher</p>
<p>than they are in the non-complicated grieving group.</p>
<p>This raises a very interesting idea</p>
<p>and relates very closely</p>
<p>to what we were talking about with vagal tone.</p>
<p>You could imagine a situation</p>
<p>in which people who are experiencing complicated grief</p>
<p>have higher levels of afternoon and nighttime cortisol</p>
<p>because they are in complicated grief,</p>
<p>but you could also imagine the opposite,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re experiencing complicated grief</p>
<p>because of the fact that they have elevated cortisol.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s very likely that it&rsquo;s bi-directional,</p>
<p>that the answer isn&rsquo;t one or the other, but both,</p>
<p>that complicated grief changes patterns of cortisol</p>
<p>and that patterns of cortisol change the likelihood</p>
<p>that one has complicated grief.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most logical interpretation of data like these.</p>
<p>However, when taken along with the data on vagal tone,</p>
<p>that people who have a higher level of vagal tone</p>
<p>are better able to navigate situations</p>
<p>of the sort that we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>and that some people perhaps have oxytocin receptors</p>
<p>or patterns of catecholamines or epinephrine</p>
<p>that position them to be more likely to grieve</p>
<p>in a particular way, we arrive at a scenario</p>
<p>where it makes very good sense to think about modulating,</p>
<p>that is controlling the foundation of your life</p>
<p>in a way that establishes cortisol rhythms</p>
<p>and sleep patterns and patterns of autonomic arousal</p>
<p>and catecholamine release that position you</p>
<p>to navigate the grief process in the best possible way.</p>
<p>If that was a complicated mouthful to digest,</p>
<p>let me restate it in a simpler way.</p>
<p>If you are somebody who is heading into grief</p>
<p>or is challenged with grief, complicated grief or otherwise,</p>
<p>prolonged grief or otherwise,</p>
<p>getting adequate sleep at night</p>
<p>and establishing as normal a pattern of cortisol as possible</p>
<p>is going to be very important.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a very simple, straightforward way to do this.</p>
<p>And I apologize to the listeners of this podcast in advance</p>
<p>if I sound like a repeating record,</p>
<p>but the most powerful way to do this</p>
<p>is to view sunlight very close to waking.</p>
<p>It does not have to be right at sunrise,</p>
<p>but when you get up in the morning, if the sun isn&rsquo;t out,</p>
<p>please turn on as many bright lights</p>
<p>as possible in your environment.</p>
<p>And then once the sun is out,</p>
<p>try and get some bright sunlight in your eyes.</p>
<p>Never look at any light so bright</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s painful to look at sunlight or otherwise.</p>
<p>If you live in an area of the world</p>
<p>where there isn&rsquo;t a lot of sunlight,</p>
<p>please keep in mind that sunlight coming through cloud cover</p>
<p>is going to still be a very effective mechanism</p>
<p>for establishing this cortisol rhythm.</p>
<p>Why do I say this thing about sunlight</p>
<p>over and over and over again?</p>
<p>Well, having an early day cortisol peak</p>
<p>and a very low cortisol level late in the day,</p>
<p>4 p.m. and 9 p.m. is immensely beneficial.</p>
<p>It reflects a properly regulated autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>It means being alert during the day</p>
<p>and your ability to sleep at night</p>
<p>is tightly correlated to this viewing of sunlight</p>
<p>in the morning.</p>
<p>If you have additional questions about this</p>
<p>or these protocols,</p>
<p>please see our mastering sleep episode</p>
<p>also at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>But in brief,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to wear sunglasses when you do this.</p>
<p>You do not want to do this through a window or a windshield.</p>
<p>It is 50 times less effective at least</p>
<p>because of filtering of the proper wavelengths.</p>
<p>It is fine to wear eyeglasses,</p>
<p>meaning corrective lenses or contacts,</p>
<p>even if they have UV protection.</p>
<p>Again, sunlight is best 10 minutes to 30 minutes</p>
<p>depending on how bright it is outside</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>I keep coming back to this protocol</p>
<p>because first of all,</p>
<p>it is a zero cost,</p>
<p>but very effective way to regulate</p>
<p>things like cortisol rhythms,</p>
<p>melatonin rhythms,</p>
<p>wakefulness during the day,</p>
<p>ease of falling asleep at night and so on.</p>
<p>And second of all,</p>
<p>because I want to emphasize this idea of modulation.</p>
<p>There are processes in our brain and body</p>
<p>which directly mediate some psychological effect</p>
<p>or physiological effect, right?</p>
<p>Dopamine is directly involved in motivation.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who struggles with motivation,</p>
<p>your dopamine system is likely to be dysregulated</p>
<p>in some way,</p>
<p>and there are behavioral tools and other tools</p>
<p>to adjust that.</p>
<p>We had an episode on dopamine motivation and drive</p>
<p>that talks extensively about those tools.</p>
<p>However, the process of grief</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be distilled down to one molecule,</p>
<p>one circuit such that we can say,</p>
<p>oh, you know,</p>
<p>take this supplement or eat this diet</p>
<p>and or exercise in the following way,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll recover from grief more quickly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply not the case.</p>
<p>It is the case, however,</p>
<p>that proper sleep at night sets the foundation</p>
<p>for the proper emotional tone</p>
<p>to be able to navigate physical, psychological,</p>
<p>and other types of challenges.</p>
<p>And not incidentally, sleep at night,</p>
<p>I should say sufficient duration and quality</p>
<p>of sleep at night</p>
<p>is the way in which you engage neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>the reordering of neural connections.</p>
<p>And everything we&rsquo;ve been talking about today</p>
<p>about reordering of the maps in your mind,</p>
<p>this tripartite three-part map of space, time,</p>
<p>and closeness involves neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>the reconfiguring of connections between neurons,</p>
<p>strengthening certain pathways</p>
<p>and not strengthening others.</p>
<p>Actively trying to disengage from the what if, right?</p>
<p>This counterintuitive thinking.</p>
<p>Actively trying to disengage from the expectations</p>
<p>that someone will be there.</p>
<p>Although when you find yourself doing that,</p>
<p>understanding why it&rsquo;s so reflexive and normal to do that.</p>
<p>Actively trying to lean into the real attachment</p>
<p>to somebody, animal, or thing.</p>
<p>And yet at the same time,</p>
<p>not diluting yourself</p>
<p>and undermining the whole process of grieving</p>
<p>by trying to imagine that they are in fact</p>
<p>still truly there, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very narrow knife edge of a process,</p>
<p>which is why it&rsquo;s so challenging.</p>
<p>Regulating your cortisol rhythm</p>
<p>through viewing sunlight early in the day.</p>
<p>And I should also say avoiding bright lights</p>
<p>from artificial sources in the evening,</p>
<p>generally 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.</p>
<p>But certainly in the evening,</p>
<p>trying to dim lights in your immediate environment,</p>
<p>trying to avoid bright screens,</p>
<p>bright artificial lights as much as possible</p>
<p>and accessing that deep sleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s modulating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s setting an overall autonomic state</p>
<p>or an overall autonomic landscape</p>
<p>would be the better way to describe it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to allow you to sleep and get neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Sleep and be in the best emotional state</p>
<p>to navigate the grieving process.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s only fair to say that the grieving process</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re describing it is hard.</p>
<p>And not just because it&rsquo;s emotionally hard,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cognitively hard.</p>
<p>You just think about what&rsquo;s required</p>
<p>to move through grief properly, if you will.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s thinking about and actually physically experiencing</p>
<p>the depth, the full depth of the attachment to the person,</p>
<p>while at the same time trying to uncouple</p>
<p>from that rich menu, that catalog of episodic memories</p>
<p>that can date back many, many years</p>
<p>and have so much richness, so many predictions</p>
<p>form on the basis of those episodic memories</p>
<p>and actively trying to distance ourselves</p>
<p>from those memories by being very anchored</p>
<p>in the fact that we are present.</p>
<p>We are the person alone in that room,</p>
<p>or in some cases with a bereavement group in that room</p>
<p>or with other people that are mourning the loss</p>
<p>of that individual animal or thing.</p>
<p>And that knife edge of feeling the intense attachment</p>
<p>while also disengaging from all the things</p>
<p>that led to that attachment.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s understandable why that would be so challenging</p>
<p>and it should also be understandable</p>
<p>why positioning yourself to be able to do that</p>
<p>in the best possible way requires proper sleep.</p>
<p>So what are the tools that we can think about using</p>
<p>in terms of healthy, adaptive moving through grief,</p>
<p>trying to avoid complicated grief</p>
<p>and prolonged grief disorders?</p>
<p>I realize that word disorder implies all sorts of things,</p>
<p>but again, those are just naming categorizations</p>
<p>that people come up with that I think fairly reflect</p>
<p>the fact that some people have more challenge</p>
<p>moving through grieving than others.</p>
<p>And for some people, it can be very extended.</p>
<p>I think the common misunderstanding is that proper grieving</p>
<p>involves moving through something quickly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re certainly not saying that.</p>
<p>However, it is very clear that some people can get stuck</p>
<p>and that process of getting stuck, you should now understand</p>
<p>has a lot to do with maintaining</p>
<p>or reactivating those episodic memories,</p>
<p>those expectations of where somebody</p>
<p>will be in space and time.</p>
<p>So what can we say about the tools for moving through grief?</p>
<p>Clearly, it&rsquo;s a value to dedicate some period of time,</p>
<p>perhaps every day, perhaps every other day,</p>
<p>depending on your capacity and schedule.</p>
<p>These could be periods of time ranging anywhere</p>
<p>from five to 45 minutes, maybe longer.</p>
<p>These blocks of time would be appropriately described</p>
<p>as rational grieving, right?</p>
<p>Rational grieving is a clear acceptance of the new reality</p>
<p>that the person, animal, or thing no longer exists</p>
<p>in the same space-time dimensionality</p>
<p>that we knew them before,</p>
<p>and yet holding onto an anchoring</p>
<p>to the attachment that we had.</p>
<p>This is, again, not an unhealthy anchoring</p>
<p>to the attachment.</p>
<p>This is really anchoring to the depth and the intensity</p>
<p>of the attachment that existed as a way to,</p>
<p>for lack of a better way to put it,</p>
<p>push off from those episodic memories,</p>
<p>to distance ourselves from them,</p>
<p>because those episodic memories are the ones</p>
<p>that lead us to look for the person in our current reality.</p>
<p>And assuming this is a real and complete loss,</p>
<p>those sorts of expectations are maladaptive.</p>
<p>They do not serve us well.</p>
<p>The second aspect of this is to understand</p>
<p>that the node of the map,</p>
<p>the component of the neural map that you&rsquo;re anchoring to,</p>
<p>is a very real component of you.</p>
<p>These are literally cells</p>
<p>that represent the depth of attachment.</p>
<p>They are linked up with your emotional centers in the brain,</p>
<p>and indeed, they are linked up with your body.</p>
<p>I think one of the things that comes up so often</p>
<p>when people are grieving is why does it hurt so much?</p>
<p>Well, that hurt is that yearning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that anticipation of action that you want to engage in,</p>
<p>but some part of you at least knows</p>
<p>that it leads nowhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that reaching for that glass of water</p>
<p>in a kind of desert of thirst,</p>
<p>and you know you can&rsquo;t have it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it hurts so badly,</p>
<p>because the systems of your brain and body</p>
<p>are in a place of anticipation, of readiness.</p>
<p>And given the activation of these brain reward systems,</p>
<p>like the nucleus accumbens,</p>
<p>given your now understanding of oxytocin,</p>
<p>being more enriched in the nucleus accumbens</p>
<p>of some individuals as opposed to others,</p>
<p>it should make perfect sense</p>
<p>as to why it&rsquo;s so painful in your body.</p>
<p>We talked a moment ago about the importance</p>
<p>of accessing quality sleep on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Gave you at least one tool to do that.</p>
<p>There, again, a rich array of tools to do that</p>
<p>in the Mastering Sleep episode.</p>
<p>And again, highlighting the importance of sleep</p>
<p>for not just emotion regulation and autonomic control,</p>
<p>which is so vital,</p>
<p>but also for making sure that neuroplasticity takes place,</p>
<p>because again, neuroplasticity is a two-part process.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the triggering of the plasticity,</p>
<p>which in the case of the things we&rsquo;re talking about today,</p>
<p>will be naturally activated</p>
<p>by the practice of a dedicated focusing on the attachment,</p>
<p>feeling the attachment to the person,</p>
<p>maybe even writing about the attachment to the person</p>
<p>as was described in that previous study.</p>
<p>But also just the plasticity is triggered</p>
<p>by the mere loss of that person,</p>
<p>the intensity of that experience.</p>
<p>But neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>the literal rewiring of connections occurs</p>
<p>during deep sleep and in what I call non-sleep deep rest,</p>
<p>or NSDR.</p>
<p>You can find NSDR scripts.</p>
<p>These are short behavioral protocols</p>
<p>that you do for 10 to 30 minutes</p>
<p>at some point throughout the day,</p>
<p>maybe even multiple times a day</p>
<p>that have been shown to accelerate neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>So having such a practice can be very useful</p>
<p>and understand that it involves some cognitive work.</p>
<p>We have to hold onto the attachment</p>
<p>and imagine and feel as much as we can the attachment,</p>
<p>while also being extremely rationally grounded</p>
<p>and trying to not try to hold onto the past,</p>
<p>trying to not anticipate the person walking in the room.</p>
<p>This is very hard because when we think</p>
<p>about the attachment,</p>
<p>the attachment tends to drag with it</p>
<p>those episodic memories,</p>
<p>that rich catalog of experiences.</p>
<p>The expectation that they will walk in the room</p>
<p>is perfectly natural.</p>
<p>The hard cognitive work</p>
<p>is to experience the deep emotional attachment</p>
<p>while at the same time severing from</p>
<p>or distancing ourselves from these expectations</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ll suddenly show up in our reality</p>
<p>when in fact they won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And we talked about preparing ourselves for grief, right?</p>
<p>If we have a loved one that&rsquo;s dying,</p>
<p>or we anticipate that at some point</p>
<p>we are going to have a loss of some sort,</p>
<p>could be death, could be a loss of another type,</p>
<p>breakup, et cetera,</p>
<p>that we can prepare ourselves to grieve more adaptively</p>
<p>by regulating the level of catecholamines,</p>
<p>in particular epinephrine.</p>
<p>That was well-described in the study</p>
<p>that I referred to earlier.</p>
<p>And tools such as the one found</p>
<p>in our mastering stress episode</p>
<p>and tools of the sort that we talked about today,</p>
<p>increasing that vagal tone</p>
<p>by actively building up the relationship between exhales</p>
<p>and slowing down of the heart rate,</p>
<p>so-called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.</p>
<p>Those things can be very useful tools.</p>
<p>So we can actually encourage our nervous system</p>
<p>and build our nervous system</p>
<p>and build our mind to prepare for grief</p>
<p>when it inevitably will come.</p>
<p>Again, this is not about buffering ourselves</p>
<p>from the realities of life.</p>
<p>This is not about disengaging from grief</p>
<p>as a real and important process.</p>
<p>And indeed it is a real and important process to engage in.</p>
<p>Those that enter denial</p>
<p>or trying to distract themselves with substances</p>
<p>or thinking or distracting of behavior,</p>
<p>substances or otherwise,</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t move through grief as well,</p>
<p>as adaptively as those who embrace a process</p>
<p>of the sort that I&rsquo;m describing here.</p>
<p>And of course, I want to restate again</p>
<p>that even though grief and depression</p>
<p>are now known to be fundamentally different,</p>
<p>even though people move through the different stages of grief</p>
<p>at different rates and sometimes skip stages, et cetera,</p>
<p>it is often important to access</p>
<p>a trained professional psychologist or psychiatrist</p>
<p>or both or bereavement group or all of the above</p>
<p>in order to get the proper support for grieving.</p>
<p>So this is a podcast about science and science-based tools,</p>
<p>but I absolutely want to emphasize</p>
<p>that there are terrific resources out there</p>
<p>that you can access.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say this in any kind of glib</p>
<p>or kind of pass the buck kind of way.</p>
<p>There are wonderful trained therapists,</p>
<p>bereavement groups, psychiatrists</p>
<p>that are expert in navigating these sorts of things.</p>
<p>I like to think that the tools that we&rsquo;ve talked about today</p>
<p>would be not only compatible,</p>
<p>but would be complimentary to the sorts of approaches</p>
<p>that they take.</p>
<p>And as we think about this process of grief,</p>
<p>as we all should at some point in our lives,</p>
<p>because we all indeed will experience grief</p>
<p>in one form or another,</p>
<p>I would hope that the information that we discussed today</p>
<p>would not only give you some tools,</p>
<p>but hopefully give you a better understanding</p>
<p>of not just the people that you&rsquo;ve lost</p>
<p>or that you stand to lose,</p>
<p>not just the animals that you&rsquo;ve lost and stand to lose,</p>
<p>but also give you a sense of why it is</p>
<p>that the people who are still in your life</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re attached to,</p>
<p>the animals that are still in your life</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re attached to have such profound meaning for you.</p>
<p>And I would encourage you to not lean away from,</p>
<p>but rather to lean into the building</p>
<p>of those episodic memories,</p>
<p>to build up a richer and richer set of experiences</p>
<p>and emotional attachments.</p>
<p>Because while the process of grieving</p>
<p>is in direct relation to how close we are attached to people</p>
<p>there are ways to move through it.</p>
<p>And of course it is the depth of our attachments</p>
<p>and the number and the depth of meaning of experiences</p>
<p>that we share with others and with animals</p>
<p>that makes life so rich and worth living.</p>
<p>So I just want to take a moment and say,</p>
<p>thank you for being willing to explore</p>
<p>this rather complicated</p>
<p>and sometimes extremely challenging thing</p>
<p>that we call grief from the perspective</p>
<p>or through the lens of neuroscience and psychology.</p>
<p>I certainly learned a lot in exploring this literature.</p>
<p>I also really look forward to hosting people</p>
<p>like Dr. O&rsquo;Connor on the podcast and others on the podcast</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve done such beautiful work in this area.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve put out the request and hopefully they&rsquo;ll join us soon</p>
<p>to further elaborate and teach us</p>
<p>about this fundamental component of our lives.</p>

<p>Not during today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve discussed supplements.</p>
<p>While supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>for things like easing and accelerating</p>
<p>the transition time into sleep</p>
<p>and getting better, deeper sleep,</p>
<p>as well as things such as focus, et cetera.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve partnered with Momentus Supplements</p>
<p>because Momentus Supplements, first of all,</p>
<p>are of extremely high quality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s obviously important.</p>
<p>Also, they ship internationally.</p>
<p>We had heard from many of you</p>
<p>that you were having trouble accessing</p>
<p>some of the supplements that were described</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>because you did not live in the US.</p>
<p>Momentus ships both within the US and abroad.</p>
<p>And many of you have also requested</p>
<p>that there be a single site where you could access</p>
<p>all of the supplements that we&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>Right now at livemomentus.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>you can find a subset of the supplements</p>
<p>that have been described on this podcast.</p>
<p>Again, all of the very highest quality,</p>
<p>each single ingredient supplements.</p>
<p>That turns out to be very important</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to develop</p>
<p>the proper array of supplements for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not helpful to have supplements</p>
<p>that include many ingredients.</p>
<p>So we encourage Momentus to have</p>
<p>single ingredient supplements with dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build up</p>
<p>from the minimal effective dose and so on.</p>
<p>And the catalog of supplements</p>
<p>they are going to add to that location,</p>
<p>livemomentus.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>is going to expand in the weeks and months to come.</p>
<p>And we expect that in a fairly short amount of time,</p>
<p>all of the supplements that we&rsquo;ve described</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab Podcast will be there.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not already following Huberman Lab</p>
<p>on Instagram and Twitter,</p>
<p>I post science and science related tools</p>
<p>at Huberman Lab on Instagram,</p>
<p>also at Huberman Lab on Twitter.</p>
<p>Oftentimes that material will overlap somewhat</p>
<p>with the content covered on this podcast,</p>
<p>but more often than not,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m covering on Instagram and Twitter</p>
<p>is distinct from the information I cover</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>We also have a newsletter that has summaries of podcasts</p>
<p>and points to specific protocols</p>
<p>and links that could be useful to you.</p>
<p>That is the Neural Network Newsletter.</p>
<p>And you can find it at HubermanLab.com,</p>
<p>go to the menu, go to newsletter.</p>
<p>You can sign up simply by giving us your email.</p>
<p>We do not share your email with anybody else.</p>
<p>Our privacy policy is there and is made very clear.</p>
<p>You can also see some newsletters of months past.</p>
<p>So you can assess whether or not</p>
<p>you really do want to sign up.</p>
<p>Although I like to think that you will.</p>
<p>Again, zero cost, total privacy of your email account.</p>
<p>And many people find those summaries and takeaway tools</p>
<p>to be very useful in navigating</p>
<p>these admittedly long podcast episodes.</p>
<p>And last, but certainly not least,</p>
<p>thank you for your interest in science.</p>
