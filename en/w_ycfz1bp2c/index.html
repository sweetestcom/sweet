think of herbs for the liver you think they&amp;rsquo;re very very beneficial and most herbs are very healthy for the liver especially those that are bitter there&amp;rsquo;s all sorts of phytochemicals that support the liver a herb that&amp;rsquo;s very important would be milk thistle or stinging nettle root two very very powerful herbs there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of plants that are good for the liver as well dandelion greens is very good for the liver and there&amp;rsquo;s many many more but there are herbs that are a bit toxic to your liver in large amounts but the six herbs i&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about um don&amp;rsquo;t affect everyone but a certain population they do so i want to bring them up to increase your awareness so the first one we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about is kava kava now kava kava is great for relaxation it&amp;rsquo;s good for stress and if you&amp;rsquo;re consuming it traditionally you&amp;rsquo;re going to consume the roots you&amp;rsquo;re not going to do the stems or the leaves and unfortunately certain nutritional companies to save money they&amp;rsquo;ll use the whole plant and that&amp;rsquo;s when you get into trouble because the stems and the leaves are are a bit more toxic to the liver than the roots now the main thing with kava kava is that it should never be taken with drugs or alcohol because it will tend to hold that chemical in the liver a lot longer and that&amp;rsquo;s really what creates a lot of the damage so it would be like you consuming alcohol but then you can&amp;rsquo;t release the toxic effects of alcohol so that would be a situation so traditionally people that use kava kava they would chew the root and then they would spit it out and your saliva has certain enzymes to kind of deal with the toxicity that would affect your liver so fortunately we don&amp;rsquo;t do that anymore all right the next one is shepparel and that has been used for over 50 different elements including cancer asthma tb skin problems you name it now this herb is banned in many different countries and it&amp;rsquo;s been known to be very poisonous even indicated by the fda but you can still buy it my recommendation is to choose some other safer herbs because this potentially could create a problem in certain people if you have too much and this herb also affects the liver&amp;rsquo;s ability to detoxify so we don&amp;rsquo;t want that and so the next herb would be called germander now this herb acts as an antiseptic antidepressant diuretic it&amp;rsquo;s even used for obesity and weight loss but unfortunately can cause hepatitis and liver cirrhosis in a certain percentage of the population so this is another one that i would probably avoid all right next one is in pila this was used in africa in fact the word for impila means health in Zulu so it&amp;rsquo;s used for stomach problems infertility coughing in worms but it can be highly toxic to the liver in the kidney in certain people and so this is another herb i probably would not recommend and number five red clover which has been used for menopause and also many other ailments but the problem with red clover in certain species it can create a toxic liver and that includes humans now what is interesting it can actually improve the thyroid but at the same time it can increase liver enzymes so when you&amp;rsquo;re researching herbs you have to really make sure that you get one that doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you another problem all right and number six st john&amp;rsquo;s wort which is very effective for depression now i actually recommend this herb if someone has depression or anxiety because it&amp;rsquo;s extremely effective but not if you&amp;rsquo;re taking medications because there are so many complications with other medications especially psychiatric drugs that you would have to take this under supervision so if you&amp;rsquo;re not taking any medication or drugs i think it&amp;rsquo;ll be okay because it&amp;rsquo;s very very effective but even though it might not cause liver damage directly it can create indirect damage because how it concentrates other medications and last note on this um saint john&amp;rsquo;s wort i mean think about what what competition that this goes up against we&amp;rsquo;re talking about a the major anti-anxiety anti-depressant medication so again i also don&amp;rsquo;t know how unbiased some of this research is against saint john&amp;rsquo;s wort and so my recommendation is if you&amp;rsquo;re taking other medications get supervision hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it&amp;rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and here&amp;rsquo;s why here&amp;rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today"><title>6 Herbs Toxic for Your Liver ｜ DrEricBergDC | SWIEST</title>

liver you think they&rsquo;re very very beneficial  </p><p>and most herbs are very healthy for 
the liver especially those that are  </p><p>bitter there&rsquo;s all sorts of phytochemicals 
that support the liver a herb that&rsquo;s very  </p><p>important would be milk thistle or stinging 
nettle root two very very powerful herbs  </p><p>there&rsquo;s a lot of plants that are good for the 
liver as well dandelion greens is very good for  </p><p>the liver and there&rsquo;s many many more but there 
are herbs that are a bit toxic to your liver  </p><p>in large amounts but the six herbs i&rsquo;m going to 
talk about um don&rsquo;t affect everyone but a certain  </p><p>population they do so i want to bring them up to 
increase your awareness so the first one we&rsquo;re  </p><p>going to talk about is kava kava now kava kava 
is great for relaxation it&rsquo;s good for stress  </p><p>and if you&rsquo;re consuming it traditionally you&rsquo;re 
going to consume the roots you&rsquo;re not going to do  </p><p>the stems or the leaves and unfortunately certain 
nutritional companies to save money they&rsquo;ll use  </p><p>the whole plant and that&rsquo;s when you get into 
trouble because the stems and the leaves are  </p><p>are a bit more toxic to the liver than the 
roots now the main thing with kava kava is that  </p><p>it should never be taken with drugs or 
alcohol because it will tend to hold  </p><p>that chemical in the liver a lot longer and 
that&rsquo;s really what creates a lot of the damage  </p><p>so it would be like you consuming alcohol but then 
you can&rsquo;t release the toxic effects of alcohol so  </p><p>that would be a situation so traditionally 
people that use kava kava they would chew the  </p><p>root and then they would spit it out and your 
saliva has certain enzymes to kind of deal with  </p><p>the toxicity that would affect your liver so 
fortunately we don&rsquo;t do that anymore all right  </p><p>the next one is shepparel and that has been 
used for over 50 different elements including  </p><p>cancer asthma tb skin problems you name it now 
this herb is banned in many different countries  </p><p>and it&rsquo;s been known to be very poisonous even 
indicated by the fda but you can still buy it my  </p><p>recommendation is to choose some other safer herbs 
because this potentially could create a problem  </p><p>in certain people if you have too much and this 
herb also affects the liver&rsquo;s ability to detoxify  </p><p>so we don&rsquo;t want that and so the next herb 
would be called germander now this herb acts  </p><p>as an antiseptic antidepressant diuretic it&rsquo;s even 
used for obesity and weight loss but unfortunately  </p><p>can cause hepatitis and liver cirrhosis in a 
certain percentage of the population so this  </p><p>is another one that i would probably avoid all 
right next one is in pila this was used in africa  </p><p>in fact the word for impila means health in Zulu 
so it&rsquo;s used for stomach problems infertility  </p><p>coughing in worms but it can be highly toxic 
to the liver in the kidney in certain people  </p><p>and so this is another herb i probably would not 
recommend and number five red clover which has  </p><p>been used for menopause and also many other 
ailments but the problem with red clover in  </p><p>certain species it can create a toxic liver and 
that includes humans now what is interesting it  </p><p>can actually improve the thyroid but at the 
same time it can increase liver enzymes so  </p><p>when you&rsquo;re researching herbs you have to really 
make sure that you get one that doesn&rsquo;t give you  </p><p>another problem all right and number six st john&rsquo;s 
wort which is very effective for depression now  </p><p>i actually recommend this herb if someone has 
depression or anxiety because it&rsquo;s extremely  </p><p>effective but not if you&rsquo;re taking medications 
because there are so many complications with other  </p><p>medications especially psychiatric drugs that you 
would have to take this under supervision so if  </p><p>you&rsquo;re not taking any medication or drugs i think 
it&rsquo;ll be okay because it&rsquo;s very very effective  </p><p>but even though it might not cause liver damage 
directly it can create indirect damage because how  </p><p>it concentrates other medications and last note 
on this um saint john&rsquo;s wort i mean think about  </p><p>what what competition that this goes up against 
we&rsquo;re talking about a the major anti-anxiety  </p><p>anti-depressant medication so again i also don&rsquo;t 
know how unbiased some of this research is against  </p><p>saint john&rsquo;s wort and so my recommendation is if 
you&rsquo;re taking other medications get supervision  </p><p>hey before you go real quick i have a course 
entitled how to bulletproof your immune system  </p><p>it&rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and 
here&rsquo;s why here&rsquo;s you here is your environment  </p><p>everyone is focused on this over here 
avoiding your environment but what about here  </p><p>what about strengthening your immune system 
that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s missing this course will show  </p><p>you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can 
tolerate and resist your environment much better  </p><p>by strengthening your own immune system i put 
a link down in the description right down below  </p><p>check it out and get signed up today</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
