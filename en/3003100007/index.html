Like a sound you hear that lingers in your ear
But you can&amp;rsquo;t forget from sundown to sunset
It&amp;rsquo;s on in the air, you hear it everywhere
No matter what you do
It&amp;rsquo;s gonna grab a hold on you

<p>[lively violin playing]</p>
<p>[upbeat rock music]</p>
<p>Like a sound you hear that lingers in your ear</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t forget from sundown to sunset</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on in the air, you hear it everywhere</p>
<p>No matter what you do</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna grab a hold on you</p>
<p>California soul</p>
<p>California soul</p>
<p>They say the sun comes up every morning now</p>
<p>And if you listen, oh so carefully</p>
<p>The winds that rise on the high tide</p>
<p>Whistles a melody</p>
<p>So the people started to sing</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how the sun gave birth, I&rsquo;m told</p>
<p>To California soul</p>
<p>California soul</p>
<p>You might as well get with it</p>
<p>Like a sound you hear that lingers in your ear</p>
<p>Oh, oh</p>
<p>California soul</p>
<p>Tim: Good morning, and thank you for joining us.</p>
<p>I really love the incredible energy in that opening.</p>
<p>It represents the way we feel about California.</p>
<p>California has always been a place for people with big ambitions and big dreams,</p>
<p>a place where people are fueled with optimism to make things better,</p>
<p>to make things that can change the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such an important part of who we are at Apple,</p>
<p>and inspires us in everything we create and do.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re proud to call California our home.</p>
<p>We have a lot to talk about today.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get started with Apple TV+.</p>
<p>Apple TV+ is a home to the world&rsquo;s most creative storytellers,</p>
<p>and continues to expand with award-winning programming.</p>
<p>Apple Original series, films, and documentaries have now been honored</p>
<p>with more than 130 wins</p>
<p>and over 500 nominations in less than two years.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so proud this year that Apple TV+</p>
<p>has 35 Primetime Emmy nominations,</p>
<p>including 20 for &ldquo;Ted Lasso,&rdquo;</p>
<p>a record for the first season of a comedy series.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re just getting started.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a quick look at a few shows that are premiering this fall.</p>
<p>Things will happen to you.</p>
<p>Things that you cannot control.</p>
<p>Raw emotion will find you.</p>
<p>When it does,</p>
<p>what you do will define who you are.</p>
<p>[exciting music]</p>
<p>Our heroes reunite.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hi! - Oh, my God.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi! - You okay?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>I wanna do something that matters.</p>
<p>Ooh</p>
<p>La, la, la, la, la, let&rsquo;s live in the moment</p>
<p>Forget Sunday morning</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>What the hell happened to my face?</p>
<p>[laughs] Welcome back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna compete with you, buddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buddy&rdquo;?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re worried you can predict the future.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re worried people believe I can.</p>
<p>My name is Jon Stewart.</p>
<p>Welcome to&hellip; &ldquo;The Problem with Jon Stewart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We should put a comma in that.</p>
<p>The world wants to test us.</p>
<p>To see if it can break us.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t beat you because he&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>He beat you because he&rsquo;s smarter.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll make it?</p>
<p>La, la, la, la, la, let&rsquo;s live in the moment.</p>
<p>Not without my team.</p>
<p>I think I can help you.</p>
<p>The first thing I&rsquo;m going to do is completely unethical.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give you a hug.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, ooh. - I&rsquo;m a hugger.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hey, remember to focus on the here and now.</p>
<p>Living in the moment, it&rsquo;s a gift.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they call it the present, y&rsquo;all.</p>
<p>Ooh</p>
<p>La, la, la, la, la, let&rsquo;s live in the moment</p>
<p>Tim: I can&rsquo;t wait for all the new shows and movies coming to Apple TV+,</p>
<p>including the second season of one of my favorites, &ldquo;The Morning Show,&rdquo;</p>
<p>which starts this Friday.</p>
<p>Next, we&rsquo;re thrilled to share our newest product announcements,</p>
<p>starting with iPad.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no other device like iPad,</p>
<p>and today, it&rsquo;s more popular and more essential than ever.</p>
<p>And the reason it&rsquo;s so popular is its amazing versatility.</p>
<p>It can transform into whatever you need it to be.</p>
<p>With advanced displays, users can literally touch their content,</p>
<p>unlike any other device.</p>
<p>With powerful and efficient Apple designed chips,</p>
<p>iPad delivers breathtaking performance all day long.</p>
<p>And with fast connectivity, advanced cameras,</p>
<p>and accessories like the Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil,</p>
<p>iPad becomes even more versatile,</p>
<p>extending what users can do on iPad and where they can do it.</p>
<p>At the heart of it all is iPadOS</p>
<p>delivering powerful features,</p>
<p>while maintaining the simplicity of a touch-first experience.</p>
<p>What makes iPad even more versatile are the over 1 million apps</p>
<p>designed specifically for its large canvas.</p>
<p>The iPad business has never been stronger.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve grown by over 40% this past year.</p>
<p>We have a great lineup today</p>
<p>with industry-leading customer satisfaction,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s about to get even stronger.</p>
<p>It starts with our most popular iPad, which delivers the full iPad experience</p>
<p>at an incredible affordable price.</p>
<p>And today it gets even better.</p>
<p>This is the new iPad,</p>
<p>and to tell you all about it, here&rsquo;s Melody.</p>
<p>[lively music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Melody: This new iPad is packed full of updates, so let&rsquo;s jump in.</p>
<p>Under the hood is a more powerful chip, A13 Bionic.</p>
<p>And it pushes even further than the speedy A12 from last year&rsquo;s iPad</p>
<p>with 20% faster performance in every aspect of the chip</p>
<p>from the CPU and GPU to the Neural Engine.</p>
<p>A13 is leaps ahead of the competition.</p>
<p>In fact, it makes this iPad up to three times faster</p>
<p>than the best-selling Chromebook</p>
<p>and up to six times faster than the best-selling Android tablet.</p>
<p>And it means users will see even more responsive performance</p>
<p>for all the things they love to do on iPad,</p>
<p>from everyday uses like messaging and browsing the web</p>
<p>to playing immersive, high-quality games.</p>
<p>And as users explore more advanced apps like Adobe Fresco</p>
<p>with its super realistic water colors,</p>
<p>A13 delivers the performance they need and then some.</p>
<p>And the more powerful Neural Engine in A13</p>
<p>makes next-generation machine learning experiences</p>
<p>like Live Text in iPadOS 15 even faster.</p>
<p>The upgraded image signal processor in A13</p>
<p>also means the rear camera captures great photos</p>
<p>with improved autofocus in low light,</p>
<p>and better selfies from the front camera as well.</p>
<p>Now, the front camera on iPad is essential</p>
<p>for things like remote learning and connecting with family.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re so thrilled to give it a big upgrade.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now a 12 MP Ultra Wide camera that produces a huge leap in image quality</p>
<p>and enables a super popular feature from iPad Pro,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s Center Stage.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re bringing the magical Center Stage experience</p>
<p>from iPad Pro to this new iPad.</p>
<p>Enabled by the Ultra Wide front camera and the Neural Engine,</p>
<p>Center Stage makes video calls more engaging</p>
<p>by automatically detecting people and dynamically adjusting the frame</p>
<p>as they move around or as more people join in.</p>
<p>It works in landscape orientation and portrait,</p>
<p>so users can enjoy Center Stage in all the ways they use iPad.</p>
<p>Not only does Center Stage work in FaceTime,</p>
<p>it makes video calls more natural in other popular apps,</p>
<p>like Zoom, BlueJeans, and Webex.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just for video conferencing.</p>
<p>Users can record, stream, and post Center Stage video</p>
<p>in apps like DoubleTake, Explain Everything, and TikTok.</p>
<p>It makes you more productive on iPad, and it&rsquo;s simply more fun.</p>
<p>Another new feature coming to this iPad that users love is True Tone.</p>
<p>It adjusts the display to the color temperature of a room</p>
<p>to provide a more comfortable viewing experience.</p>
<p>And by retaining the same popular design,</p>
<p>this iPad supports a vast array of accessories,</p>
<p>including the thin and light Smart Keyboard,</p>
<p>and third party keyboards like Logitech&rsquo;s latest rugged combo</p>
<p>with trackpad for schools.</p>
<p>And of course, this iPad supports the first-generation Apple Pencil,</p>
<p>where iPadOS makes the experience of using Apple Pencil</p>
<p>as easy and natural as pen and paper.</p>
<p>And this new iPad will ship with iPadOS 15,</p>
<p>which is packed with great new features.</p>
<p>For example, you can place widgets among your apps,</p>
<p>making important information available with just a glance.</p>
<p>New multitasking controls make it even easier to launch and use multiple apps.</p>
<p>Quick Note gives you a fast and easy way to take notes anywhere.</p>
<p>And the list goes on.</p>
<p>iPadOS is so immensely capable and so easy to use.</p>
<p>When you combine it with a beautiful display, great cameras,</p>
<p>broad accessory support, Gigabit-class LTE,</p>
<p>and all-day battery life, this iPad delivers enormous value</p>
<p>because this new iPad starts at just $329.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s with twice the storage, starting at 64 gigabytes.</p>
<p>For schools, it&rsquo;s even more affordable at just $299.</p>
<p>It comes in Space Gray and Silver, and cellular models are available as well.</p>
<p>You can order the new iPad today, and it will be available next week.</p>
<p>With the power of A13 Bionic,</p>
<p>a new 12 MP Ultra Wide front camera with Center Stage,</p>
<p>True Tone, double the storage, and the versatility of iPadOS 15,</p>
<p>this is a giant upgrade for our most popular iPad.</p>
<p>Now back to Tim.</p>
<p>Tim: We&rsquo;re excited that our most popular iPad is now so much better.</p>
<p>And now let&rsquo;s talk about iPad mini.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s simply no other device like iPad mini.</p>
<p>It gives users all the power of iPad in its most portable form,</p>
<p>which makes it indispensable for a wide range of uses,</p>
<p>like when it&rsquo;s secured to the leg of a pilot in flight</p>
<p>or pulled from a doctor&rsquo;s lab coat to care for patients in the ER.</p>
<p>iPad mini is in a class of its own.</p>
<p>And today we&rsquo;re giving our littlest iPad its biggest upgrade ever.</p>
<p>Introducing the all-new iPad mini.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Katie: As Tim said, we&rsquo;re giving iPad mini a huge set of updates‚Äì</p>
<p>a complete redesign that puts everything our users love about iPad</p>
<p>right in the palm of their hand.</p>
<p>The all-new enclosure features a beautiful all-screen design</p>
<p>with narrow borders and elegant rounded corners.</p>
<p>The design is remarkably thin and light and absolutely stunning.</p>
<p>And iPad mini now comes in a gorgeous array of new colors.</p>
<p>Purple, Pink, Starlight, and Space Gray.</p>
<p>And this design features a brilliant Liquid Retina display.</p>
<p>With this new design we were able to increase the screen size</p>
<p>all the way out to 8.3 inches, while keeping the same compact footprint.</p>
<p>With wide color, True Tone, 500 nits of brightness,</p>
<p>and the lowest reflectivity in the industry,</p>
<p>everything you view on iPad mini will look great wherever you go.</p>
<p>And delivering this edge-to-edge screen meant finding a new location for Touch ID.</p>
<p>So just like iPad Air, we put it right in the top button of iPad mini.</p>
<p>Touch ID is fast, easy, and secure,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re unlocking your iPad or using ApplePay.</p>
<p>iPad mini is already the fastest device of its kind,</p>
<p>and the performance of the new iPad mini is simply remarkable.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous generation,</p>
<p>the new iPad mini sees a 40% jump in CPU performance</p>
<p>and a whopping 80% leap in GPU performance.</p>
<p>So whether you&rsquo;re using ForeFlight</p>
<p>to navigate your flight plan with live wind speed overlays</p>
<p>or playing the graphically rich game &ldquo;Star Wars: Hunters&rdquo;</p>
<p>online with your friends,</p>
<p>the new iPad mini will power right through it with ease.</p>
<p>And the Neural Engine, for powerful machine learning applications,</p>
<p>also takes a big leap forward on the new mini,</p>
<p>increasing performance by up to two times over the previous generation.</p>
<p>Combined with the CPU and the GPU,</p>
<p>the Neural Engine enables apps</p>
<p>to deliver next-level experiences.</p>
<p>Like the new Translate app in iPadOS 15,</p>
<p>which can automatically translate a conversation in real time.</p>
<p>The performance of the new iPad mini is on a whole new level.</p>
<p>And we know that iPad users rely on ultra-fast connections.</p>
<p>Well, the most mobile iPad is about to get a lot faster</p>
<p>and even more versatile.</p>
<p>iPad mini now has a USB-C port,</p>
<p>so you get the same great USB-C functionality</p>
<p>that we brought to iPad Air,</p>
<p>which means it is up to ten times faster than its predecessor.</p>
<p>So iPad mini can now connect to a vast ecosystem of USB-C accessories,</p>
<p>which is great, whether you&rsquo;re a photographer</p>
<p>who needs to connect to cameras when shooting on location</p>
<p>or a doctor in a remote area using Butterfly to conduct an ultrasound.</p>
<p>And when users are on the go,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crucial to have access to the fastest cellular connections,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re bringing 5G to iPad mini.</p>
<p>Download speeds can be up to 3.5 gigabits per second.</p>
<p>This is key when you need to stay connected on the go,</p>
<p>like when technicians use Splunk AR on-site</p>
<p>to access real time data, performance analytics,</p>
<p>and complex schematics.</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;re using SharePlay to take a MasterClass</p>
<p>with your friends.</p>
<p>5G keeps you connected.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk about the cameras and audio.</p>
<p>Users rely on iPad mini for FaceTime,</p>
<p>taking photos and videos, and experiencing AR,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ve updated both the front and back cameras.</p>
<p>The back camera now features a 12 megapixel sensor with Focus Pixels</p>
<p>and a larger aperture</p>
<p>to capture sharp, vivid photos.</p>
<p>And we added a True Tone flash to mini for improved photos in low light.</p>
<p>With a new ISP, users will see enhanced photos with Smart HDR,</p>
<p>which improves image quality by recovering details in shadows and highlights.</p>
<p>And now with the ability to record in 4K,</p>
<p>iPad mini becomes your mobile movie studio.</p>
<p>On the front, iPad mini features the new 12 MP Ultra Wide camera,</p>
<p>which means it also supports Center Stage.</p>
<p>As Melody mentioned, this has been a huge hit on iPad Pro,</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s coming to iPad mini.</p>
<p>And iPad mini also features a new speaker system with stereo in landscape,</p>
<p>great for listening to your favorite playlist</p>
<p>or doing an Apple Fitness+ workout in your hotel room.</p>
<p>And iPad mini&rsquo;s versatility is further enhanced by its amazing accessories.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a new set of slim Smart Folio covers in beautiful coordinating colors</p>
<p>that complement the new iPad mini finishes,</p>
<p>perfect for expressing your personal style.</p>
<p>And now, iPad mini supports the amazing second-generation Apple Pencil,</p>
<p>which magnetically attaches to the side of iPad mini</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s always connected, charged, and with you.</p>
<p>Apple Pencil transforms iPad mini into your digital sketch book,</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so excited about the new iPad mini.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see it in action.</p>
<p>[percussive music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>[alarm beeping]</p>
<p>[both scream]</p>
<p>[shutter clicks]</p>
<p>[upbeat rock music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Katie: With its all-new design and huge boost in performance,</p>
<p>the new iPad mini starts at just $499,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll be available in both Wi-Fi and cellular configurations.</p>
<p>You can order it today, and it will be available next week.</p>
<p>So this is the all-new iPad mini</p>
<p>featuring a brilliant liquid retina display,</p>
<p>super fast performance,</p>
<p>new cameras front and back,</p>
<p>Center Stage, 5G, support for Apple Pencil,</p>
<p>and all-new colors.</p>
<p>With all of these new features,</p>
<p>this is by far the most powerful and versatile iPad mini ever.</p>
<p>[light music]</p>
<p>And with both the new iPad and iPad mini,</p>
<p>we continue our commitment to the environment.</p>
<p>Both of these iPad models are built with a 100% recycled aluminum enclosure.</p>
<p>And this marks a milestone for iPad.</p>
<p>Every single iPad in the lineup</p>
<p>now features a 100% recycled aluminum enclosure.</p>
<p>This is just one of the many ongoing efforts we have underway</p>
<p>to reduce the environmental impact of our products.</p>
<p>Now back to Tim.</p>
<p>Tim: With the even more capable new iPad and the phenomenal new iPad mini,</p>
<p>our iPad lineup is the best it&rsquo;s ever been.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk about Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Apple Watch is an indispensable daily companion</p>
<p>that keeps you connected to the people and things you care about most.</p>
<p>It encourages you to be active and get more out of your workouts.</p>
<p>And it monitors your health, helping you live a better day.</p>
<p>I am so inspired by the impact we&rsquo;ve had on people&rsquo;s lives,</p>
<p>and we continue to push the boundaries of what Apple Watch can do.</p>
<p>To tell you about what&rsquo;s next, here&rsquo;s Jeff.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>
<p>Jeff: Being more active</p>
<p>is one of the best ways to stay healthy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been at the heart of Apple Watch</p>
<p>since the beginning.</p>
<p>Well, today we&rsquo;re adding new features to Apple Watch</p>
<p>for everyone who rides a bike.</p>
<p>watchOS 8 will detect when you begin riding and remind you to start a workout.</p>
<p>And it will automatically pause and resume if you stop temporarily.</p>
<p>And watchOS 8 adds Fall Detection to cycling</p>
<p>by sensing the unique motion and impact of falls while riding a bike.</p>
<p>And Apple Watch now better supports e-bikes</p>
<p>with an improved workout algorithm that more accurately calculates calories.</p>
<p>These cycling updates join all the other great additions in watchOS 8,</p>
<p>like the Mindfulness app and Memories in Photos.</p>
<p>And this year we focused on making these features</p>
<p>and everything you do on Watch bigger and better.</p>
<p>Introducing&hellip;</p>
<p>the next generation of Apple Watch.</p>
<p>[dramatic music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>This is the incredible Apple Watch Series 7.</p>
<p>It takes all the great features of Apple Watch and combines them</p>
<p>with our largest and most advanced display ever.</p>
<p>The new Retina display on Series 7 has nearly 20% more screen area than Series 6.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an even bigger jump over Series 3 with over 50% more screen area.</p>
<p>The Series 7 display has been completely reengineered</p>
<p>to reduce the borders to just 1.7 millimeters.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 40% thinner than on Series 6.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible innovation that maximizes the screen area</p>
<p>while barely changing the dimensions of the watch itself.</p>
<p>And the shape of the watch has also been refined.</p>
<p>Both the case and the display of Series 7 have softer, more rounded corners.</p>
<p>The new display refracts light at its edges for a subtle wrap around effect,</p>
<p>creating a seamless integration with the curvature of the case.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also up to 70% brighter indoors when your wrist is down,</p>
<p>making it even easier to discreetly check the time.</p>
<p>This new display is an industry first</p>
<p>and we fully optimized the user interface for it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Lauren to tell you more.</p>
<p>Lauren: Across the user interface on Series 7,</p>
<p>buttons have been redesigned and enlarged</p>
<p>to complement the size and shape of the new display,</p>
<p>like in Stopwatch,</p>
<p>Activity, and Alarms,</p>
<p>making them even easier to tap.</p>
<p>It can also fit nearly 50% more text onscreen than Series 6.</p>
<p>This helps you read Messages and emails with a lot less scrolling.</p>
<p>Series 7 also features new ways to input text.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a full keyboard that you can either tap</p>
<p>or slide from letter to letter with QuickPath,</p>
<p>which uses machine learning to predict the word you&rsquo;re typing.</p>
<p>There are also new watch faces designed specifically for Series 7.</p>
<p>The dynamic Contour face animates on wrist-raise,</p>
<p>pushing the dial right out to the edge.</p>
<p>And a new Modular face leverages the extra screen area</p>
<p>with two large, data-rich center complications.</p>
<p>All of these improvements give Series 7 the best user experience</p>
<p>of any Apple Watch.</p>
<p>We also improved durability,</p>
<p>which is another essential aspect of Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Series 7 is the most durable Apple Watch we&rsquo;ve ever built.</p>
<p>It has our most crack-resistant front crystal,</p>
<p>thanks to a stronger and more robust geometry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the first Apple Watch to have IP6X certification,</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about wearing it in dusty environments.</p>
<p>And of course, it&rsquo;s still swim-proof with WR50 water resistance.</p>
<p>With our best-ever durability,</p>
<p>you can take Series 7 anywhere you want to go.</p>
<p>And use it all-day long with the same, great 18-hour battery life.</p>
<p>Series 7 also has an improved charging experience.</p>
<p>It charges up to 33% faster than Series 6.</p>
<p>With an updated charging architecture and new fast-charging USB-C cable,</p>
<p>it takes just 45 minutes to go from 0 to 80% charge.</p>
<p>And 8 minutes of charging is enough for 8 hours of Sleep Tracking.</p>
<p>We think customers will love the optimized user interface,</p>
<p>best-ever durability, and faster charging of Series 7.</p>
<p>Now back to Jeff.</p>
<p>Jeff: Series 7 will be available in five new aluminum colors,</p>
<p>Midnight, Starlight, Green, Blue, and PRODUCT(RED).</p>
<p>It will also be available in silver, graphite, and gold stainless steel,</p>
<p>as well as in natural and space black titanium.</p>
<p>Apple Watch Nike models feature a new graphic Sport Loop</p>
<p>and Nike Bounce watch face.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a new Apple Watch Hermes Circuit H leather band with matching face,</p>
<p>plus, an elegant new Double Tour band.</p>
<p>Now, of course, bands are a great way to customize your Apple Watch</p>
<p>for any activity or occasion,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ve added new colors across our most popular styles.</p>
<p>And Series 7 is compatible with all existing bands.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve designed Series 7 with the environment in mind.</p>
<p>All aluminum watch cases are made with 100% recycled metal</p>
<p>and all magnets in Series 7 use 100% recycled rare earth elements.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s our 2021 Apple Watch lineup.</p>
<p>Series 3 remains at the great entry price of $199.</p>
<p>Apple Watch SE starts at $279.</p>
<p>And Apple Watch Series 7 starts at $399.</p>
<p>Series 7 will be available later this year,</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t wait for you to try it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another look at some of the amazing capabilities</p>
<p>of Apple Watch Series 7.</p>
<p>To live is to ask the big questions.</p>
<p>Like, &ldquo;Why are we here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is our purpose?</p>
<p>And &ldquo;Whoa! How fast was that serve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>98 miles per hour. Nice.</p>
<p>But I was thinking ideas about‚Äì wow.</p>
<p>Excuse me? Yeah, how far was that drive?</p>
<p>250 yards.</p>
<p>Okay, getting back to my point, I mean, haven&rsquo;t you ever wondered&ndash;</p>
<p>How far have I gone?</p>
<p>5 miles.</p>
<p>Average speed: 12.4 miles per hour.</p>
<p>That is how far you&rsquo;ve gone.</p>
<p>But I was actually thinking&ndash;</p>
<p>wait, are you taking an ECG here?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re taking one here?</p>
<p>Are you taking an ECG next to a pi√±ata?</p>
<p>Heads up!</p>
<p>Oh, we&rsquo;re surfing.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s just‚Äì</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just impressive.</p>
<p>Wait, how many waves you get?</p>
<p>15 waves.</p>
<p>Oh, good morning. How did you sleep?</p>
<p>Why are you checking your blood oxygen level?</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s get back to the big questions, like,</p>
<p>are the mysteries of the universe out of reach?</p>
<p>Or can we discover the answers through the power of meditation?</p>
<p>Oh, come on, now!</p>
<p>You know you&rsquo;re levitating, right?</p>
<p>Sorry. Don&rsquo;t mind me.</p>
<p>Anyway, there are questions, and it seems like</p>
<p>your watch has all the answers, which is cheating.</p>
<p>Jeff: So that&rsquo;s Apple Watch Series 7.</p>
<p>It has the largest and most advanced display ever,</p>
<p>an optimized UI with new keyboard and watch faces,</p>
<p>best-ever durability, fast charging, new colors,</p>
<p>and all the great features of watchOS 8.</p>
<p>Series 7 is simply our best Apple Watch yet,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no better way to stay connected, active, and healthy.</p>
<p>And a great way to stay active and healthy with Apple Watch is with Apple Fitness+.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll hand it over to Jay to give you an update.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>

<p>help you on the slopes longer,</p>
<p>and make it your best snow season ever.</p>
<p>Now back to Jay.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>
<p>Jay: For many people, fitness is more fun when it&rsquo;s a shared experience,</p>
<p>like taking a class together or working out with a buddy.</p>
<p>We wanted to make it easier for you to work out with the people who motivate you,</p>
<p>no matter where they are in the world.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re excited to introduce Fitness+ Group Workouts powered by SharePlay.</p>

<p>Jay: And that&rsquo;s Fitness+. Back to Tim.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>
<p>Tim: With Apple Watch Series 7, the most advanced smart watch ever,</p>
<p>and the incredible new content and features in Apple Fitness+,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t wait to see the impact they&rsquo;re sure to have on our users&rsquo; lives.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about iPhone.</p>
<p>iPhone has forever changed the world.</p>
<p>Every single day people rely on iPhone, from their most demanding tasks,</p>
<p>to capturing the moments of their lives, streaming their favorite TV shows,</p>
<p>playing their favorite games,</p>
<p>staying up-to-date with the news of the world,</p>
<p>and connecting with friends and loved ones.</p>
<p>This is what drives us to create the best iPhone possible,</p>
<p>to create an experience unlike any other with legendary ease of use,</p>
<p>beautiful and durable designs,</p>
<p>with water resistance and great battery life,</p>
<p>with industry leading performance,</p>
<p>and the world&rsquo;s most advanced camera systems,</p>
<p>and with privacy built in.</p>
<p>People love iPhone.</p>
<p>And we keep making iPhone better,</p>
<p>more powerful, more capable, and even more fun to use.</p>
<p>Today we are thrilled to introduce our next generation of iPhone.</p>
<p>Here it is.</p>
<p>[bass music thumping]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>This is iPhone 13.</p>
<p>To tell you more, here&rsquo;s Kaiann.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Kaiann: Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at iPhone 13 starting with design.</p>
<p>It has the sleek, flat-edged design that people love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also incredibly durable with our exclusive Ceramic Shield front,</p>
<p>tougher than any smartphone glass,</p>
<p>and has industry leading IP68 water resistance.</p>
<p>iPhone 13 has a new look for the advanced dual-camera system</p>
<p>with the lenses arranged diagonally.</p>
<p>The aerospace-grade aluminum frame is beautifully formed</p>
<p>and really shows off five new colors:</p>
<p>an all-new Pink, Blue, Midnight, Starlight, and (PRODUCT)RED.</p>
<p>On the front, the TrueDepth camera system has been reengineered</p>
<p>to provide more display area.</p>
<p>Everything inside, including Face ID,</p>
<p>the most secure facial authentication in a smartphone,</p>
<p>fits into a space that&rsquo;s 20% smaller.</p>
<p>iPhone 13 is designed with the environment in mind,</p>
<p>using many recycled materials.</p>
<p>For example, these antenna lines use upcycled plastic water bottles,</p>
<p>an industry first.</p>
<p>Under the hood, iPhone 13 has been completely re-architected</p>
<p>to make room for new technologies and a bigger battery.</p>
<p>This beautiful design is the same across two sizes,</p>
<p>iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini.</p>
<p>Both feature a more advanced Super Retina XDR display.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 28% brighter, up to 800 nits,</p>
<p>brilliant for viewing even when you&rsquo;re outside.</p>
<p>For HDR content like photos and videos,</p>
<p>the peak brightness is higher at 1200 nits.</p>
<p>And you can enjoy the pixel-precision brightness for longer</p>
<p>thanks to the display&rsquo;s improved power efficiency.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see true blacks in games, photos, and videos</p>
<p>with the incredible contrast ratio of our OLED display.</p>
<p>This new brighter Super Retina XDR display</p>
<p>delivers an immersive viewing experience</p>
<p>with support for Dolby Vision, HDR10, and HLG.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about the chip</p>
<p>that powers iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini.</p>
<p>Frankly, the competition is still playing catch-up to our chips,</p>
<p>not just from last year, but even from two years ago.</p>
<p>And today, we&rsquo;re extending our lead with A15 Bionic.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Hope to tell you all about it.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>
<p>Hope: Our silicon is the engine of iPhone.</p>
<p>With A15 Bionic, we have innovations across the entire system</p>
<p>to deliver more performance and power efficiency,</p>
<p>At its foundation, A15 uses five nanometer technology,</p>
<p>which enables us to include nearly 15 billion transistors.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll absolutely fly through demanding workloads smoothly and efficiently</p>
<p>thanks to a powerful new 6-core CPU</p>
<p>with two high-performance and four high-efficiency cores.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve increased the performance</p>
<p>of our CPU&rsquo;s dedicated machine learning accelerators</p>
<p>that power experiences such as advanced text-to-speech in Siri</p>
<p>and on-device processing of directions in Maps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fastest CPU in any smartphone,</p>
<p>up to 50% faster than the leading competition,</p>
<p>For graphics-intensive tasks, like advanced games,</p>
<p>A15 Bionic features our latest 4-core GPU,</p>
<p>enabling more eye-catching visuals and lighting effects.</p>
<p>It delivers up to 30% faster graphics versus the leading competition.</p>
<p>And we continue to push the limits of machine learning</p>
<p>with the new 16-core Neural Engine that is perfect for ML tasks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s capable of an astounding 15.8 trillion operations per second.</p>
<p>We design our Neural Engine together</p>
<p>with our camera hardware and software teams.</p>
<p>This unique vision and integration brings to life leading capabilities</p>
<p>in video and image processing.</p>
<p>This means faster ML computations for experiences</p>
<p>like Live Text with iOS 15.</p>
<p>Point your camera at text on the go and instantly take action,</p>
<p>like buying tickets or getting directions.</p>
<p>The ML advancements across our entire chip will empower developers</p>
<p>to do even more in their apps, like SwingVision,</p>
<p>which can smoothly run powerful CoreML and AR models</p>
<p>on A15 Bionic for real-time shot tracking,</p>
<p>video analysis, and remote coaching.</p>
<p>PeakVisor helps you navigate the outdoors to identify mountains</p>
<p>and explore detail-rich 3D maps while hiking.</p>
<p>And Seek uses a machine learning model trained by over 20 million photos</p>
<p>to instantly identify plants and animals around you,</p>
<p>and all the processing is done on-device.</p>
<p>A15 is a powerhouse.</p>
<p>In addition to core performance improvements,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a new display engine,</p>
<p>new video encoder and decoder,</p>
<p>and twice the system cache.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing in the world like this chip.</p>
<p>Back to Kaiann.</p>
<p>Kaiann: A15 Bionic also powers the amazing camera system on iPhone 13.</p>
<p>It combines our powerful cameras,</p>
<p>next-generation image signal processor,</p>
<p>and computational photography to create our most advanced dual-camera system.</p>
<p>The all-new Wide camera lets you take stunning shots in any situation,</p>
<p>like this photo full of color and texture.</p>
<p>It gathers 47% more light for less noise and brighter results</p>
<p>in your photos and videos.</p>
<p>This is enabled by larger, 1.7-micron pixels</p>
<p>that capture more light and a wide f/1.6 aperture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the biggest sensor we&rsquo;ve ever put in our dual-camera system.</p>
<p>iPhone 12 Pro Max introduced an amazing advanced technology,</p>
<p>sensor-shift optical image stabilization.</p>
<p>And incredibly, we are bringing this to iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a low-light photo from the new Wide camera with sensor-shift OIS.</p>
<p>The larger sensor captures nearly 50% more light.</p>
<p>Hard to believe this photo was taken in a dark room</p>
<p>with just a little light coming through a window.</p>
<p>Night mode shots are even more impressive.</p>
<p>Capture times are shorter, too, for sharper images of your subjects</p>
<p>and fine details.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also custom-designed a new Ultra Wide camera</p>
<p>that will reveal more of the dark areas with less noise,</p>
<p>like you see here in the walls and ceilings.</p>
<p>Capturing fun, creative perspectives is easy with the Ultra Wide</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s even better on iPhone 13.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s switch to video.</p>
<p>iPhone already has the highest quality video in a smartphone.</p>
<p>And iPhone 13 brings a brand-new feature,</p>
<p>Cinematic mode.</p>
<p>Now over to Johnnie to tell you more.</p>
<p>Johnnie: Filmmakers have used focus changes</p>
<p>to tell engaging stories for decades.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a technique called rack focus</p>
<p>that requires skill, planning, and creative vision.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen rack focus used in all your favorite films.</p>
<p>It brings a whole new dimension to storytelling.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re bringing this capability to iPhone</p>
<p>in a simple and intuitive way,</p>
<p>so you can capture cinema-style moments,</p>
<p>even if you aren&rsquo;t a professional filmmaker.</p>
<p>And guess what, the movie clip you just saw</p>
<p>was shot on iPhone.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;d love to show you more.</p>
<p>[mysterious music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>[door slams]</p>
<p>[siren wailing]</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s remarkable and so easy to use.</p>
<p>Just start recording,</p>
<p>and Cinematic mode will hold focus on the subject</p>
<p>even when they&rsquo;re moving.</p>
<p>Focus transitions happen automatically in real time,</p>
<p>like from one subject to another.</p>
<p>Cinematic mode anticipates when a subject is about to enter the frame,</p>
<p>and intelligently racks focus to them when they do,</p>
<p>And when a subject gazes away from the camera,</p>
<p>iPhone itself changes focus and then back.</p>
<p>To create these automatic focus changes,</p>
<p>we extensively studied the art of cinematography</p>
<p>and the creative choices directors of photography make</p>
<p>to guide the viewers&rsquo; attention.</p>
<p>We combined these learnings</p>
<p>with computational algorithms</p>
<p>so you can effortlessly create cinema-grade videos.</p>
<p>For more creative control, you can tap to shift focus at any time.</p>
<p>Tap again to lock and track focus on the subject.</p>
<p>Cinematic mode shoots in Dolby Vision HDR.</p>
<p>This is enabled by our Apple-custom sensor</p>
<p>and the incredible power of A15 Bionic,</p>
<p>which grades each frame in Dolby Vision</p>
<p>live while you are recording.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s Cinematic mode.</p>
<p>Now back to Kaiann.</p>
<p>Kaiann: iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini</p>
<p>have advanced new camera systems</p>
<p>with sensor-shift OIS,</p>
<p>fantastic low-light performance,</p>
<p>and Cinematic mode also on the front TrueDepth camera.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s turn to 5G.</p>
<p>Millions and millions of iPhone users are already experiencing 5G every day</p>
<p>for super fast downloads and uploads, lower latency,</p>
<p>and new experiences on the go.</p>
<p>And on iPhone 13, we&rsquo;ve innovated further</p>
<p>on custom-designed antennas and radio components</p>
<p>that let us add more bands</p>
<p>so iPhone 13 works on 5G with the latest speeds and in more places.</p>
<p>The world is moving quickly to 5G.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re collaborating with more carrier partners</p>
<p>for the best call quality, performance, coverage, and battery life.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, we will double 5G support</p>
<p>to over 200 carriers in 60 countries and regions.</p>
<p>That means you can benefit from 5G in more places than ever</p>
<p>to binge watch your favorite shows together using SharePlay on Apple TV+</p>
<p>and even more streaming partners for video and music.</p>
<p>You can be ultra competitive in multiplayer games,</p>
<p>share surprise greetings from a celebrity in high res over Cameo,</p>
<p>or take the sound at any live event to a whole new level with Mix Halo.</p>
<p>5G is taking over,</p>
<p>and iPhone 13 is ready with the best 5G experience.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about battery life,</p>
<p>which is really important to our users.</p>
<p>iPhone 13 has a faster chip,</p>
<p>faster 5G speeds, a brighter OLED display,</p>
<p>and the most advanced dual-camera system ever in an iPhone.</p>
<p>And with all these new capabilities,</p>
<p>the iPhone 13 lineup has better battery life.</p>
<p>On iPhone 13 mini, most users will experience</p>
<p>an hour and a half hour longer in their day than with iPhone 12 mini.</p>
<p>And on iPhone 13, two and a half hours longer</p>
<p>than iPhone 12 for incredible all-day battery life.</p>
<p>This amazing battery life is delivered by A15 Bionic,</p>
<p>more power-efficient components, a bigger battery,</p>
<p>and power optimizations from our deep hardware and software integration,</p>
<p>like Smart Data Mode, which intelligently conserves battery life</p>
<p>by automatically shifting your iPhone to LTE when 5G speeds aren&rsquo;t needed.</p>
<p>We also look at every opportunity to improve privacy.</p>
<p>With iPhone and iOS, privacy is built in from the beginning.</p>
<p>With iOS 15, Siri uses on-device speech recognition,</p>
<p>meaning your Siri audio requests do not leave your iPhone by default.</p>
<p>Intelligent tracking prevention now prevents trackers from profiling you</p>
<p>using your IP address.</p>
<p>And mail privacy protection hides your IP address</p>
<p>and prevents senders from learning about your mail activity.</p>
<p>Another huge benefit of owning an iPhone is the vast ecosystem</p>
<p>that extends what iPhone can do.</p>
<p>That includes MagSafe, which we introduced last fall</p>
<p>and has been a hit.</p>
<p>From multi-chargers and swiveling charger stands</p>
<p>to cases, wallets, tripods, and car mounts,</p>
<p>along with our own accessories</p>
<p>for charging, like the MagSafe Battery Pack.</p>
<p>For iPhone 13, we have leather, silicone, and clear cases</p>
<p>in stunning new colors</p>
<p>and engineered to work perfectly with MagSafe.</p>
<p>We also have a new MagSafe Leather Wallet</p>
<p>that supports Find My.</p>
<p>You can now be notified of the last known location</p>
<p>where your wallet was separated from your iPhone.</p>
<p>iPhone 13 is loaded with new technologies,</p>
<p>including Cinematic mode,</p>
<p>A15 Bionic that&rsquo;s faster than the competition,</p>
<p>our most advanced dual-camera system with sensor-shift OIS,</p>
<p>longer battery life, 5G, and so much more.</p>
<p>With all this, iPhone 13 still starts</p>
<p>at just $699.</p>
<p>We also have some fantastic offers from Apple and our partners,</p>
<p>including up to $700 off in the U.S.</p>
<p>when you trade in a qualifying iPhone.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re increasing the starting capacity to 128 gigabytes</p>
<p>for double the storage and adding a new 512-gigabyte option.</p>
<p>iPhone 13 is impressively powerful.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see it in action.</p>

<p>Tim: We are so excited for iPhone 13.</p>
<p>With all of its power and capability,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t wait to see what our customers will do with it,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not done yet.</p>
<p>Our Pro lineup pushes the limits with our most advanced technologies</p>
<p>for our users who want the very best iPhone,</p>
<p>best-in-class performance, best-in-class camera experience,</p>
<p>great durability, larger displays,</p>
<p>and incredible design.</p>
<p>This year, we build on that in a major way.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at our most Pro iPhone ever.</p>
<p>[dramatic pop music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>This is iPhone 13 Pro.</p>
<p>To tell you more, here&rsquo;s Joz.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>
<p>Joz: iPhone 13 Pro features our most pro design</p>
<p>with exceptional materials,</p>
<p>like these surgical-grade stainless steel bands.</p>
<p>Each band goes through a physical vapor deposition process</p>
<p>to create an Apple-custom finish that is so elegant,</p>
<p>yet incredibly resistant to abrasion and corrosion.</p>
<p>iPhone 13 Pro comes in four striking finishes,</p>
<p>a rich, deep graphite, gorgeous gold,</p>
<p>beautiful silver, and this all-new sierra blue.</p>
<p>This sierra blue required an entirely new process,</p>
<p>using multiple layers of nanometer-scale metallic ceramics applied</p>
<p>across the surface for a stunning and very durable finish.</p>
<p>iPhone 13 Pro has a newly designed front</p>
<p>with a TrueDepth camera system that&rsquo;s 20% smaller.</p>
<p>On the back, you see our incredible new camera system</p>
<p>with beautiful stainless steel trim</p>
<p>that perfectly surrounds the sapphire crystal lenses</p>
<p>of each of our three new cameras,</p>
<p>and a beautiful textured matte glass that feels great</p>
<p>and shows off the stunning color.</p>
<p>On the front, it has our incredible Ceramic Shield</p>
<p>that is tougher than any smartphone glass.</p>
<p>It also has industry-leading IP68 water resistance.</p>
<p>On the inside, it&rsquo;s been completely redesigned</p>
<p>to support our latest pro technologies,</p>
<p>including the all-new camera system,</p>
<p>incredible new display, and a bigger battery.</p>
<p>iPhone 13 Pro also supports MagSafe and the ever-expanding ecosystem</p>
<p>of really cool, new accessories.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s joined by the larger iPhone 13 Pro Max.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about performance and the powerful new A15 Bionic.</p>
<p>As you heard from Hope, A15 Bionic features a CPU</p>
<p>with two new high-performance cores and four new high-efficiency cores,</p>
<p>and a faster Neural Engine, as well as our new ISP,</p>
<p>which provides improved noise reduction and tone mapping.</p>
<p>And for these Pro models,</p>
<p>A15 Bionic includes our most powerful graphics ever</p>
<p>with a new 5-core GPU.</p>
<p>It provides up to 50% faster graphics performance than the leading competition.</p>
<p>In fact, iPhone 13 Pro has the fastest graphics performance</p>
<p>in any smartphone ever,</p>
<p>great for high-performance gaming</p>
<p>and our most powerful camera features,</p>
<p>like Apple ProRAW and 4K Dolby Vision video.</p>
<p>And the A15 Bionic chip&rsquo;s new 5-core GPU and custom display engine combine</p>
<p>with an amazing new display that takes the iPhone experience even further.</p>
<p>This year, we&rsquo;re proud to introduce an entirely new Super Retina XDR display.</p>
<p>With a new, more efficient OLED panel,</p>
<p>the display now supports up to 1000 nits peak outdoor brightness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 25% higher than last year.</p>
<p>And for the first time, we&rsquo;re bringing ProMotion to iPhone.</p>
<p>With our latest technology, this ProMotion display can refresh</p>
<p>from as low as 10 hertz to as high as 120 hertz.</p>
<p>ProMotion is designed to respond dynamically and match your content.</p>
<p>The advanced, custom architecture produces fast frame rates when you need them,</p>
<p>and preserves battery life when you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We also optimized iOS to take full advantage of this.</p>
<p>For example, when swiping between apps or scrolling,</p>
<p>the system adapts the frame rates</p>
<p>to precisely match the speed of the user&rsquo;s finger.</p>
<p>The result is an incredibly responsive experience that is fast and fluid.</p>
<p>Of course, ProMotion is also great for apps,</p>
<p>providing more responsive inputs, smoother graphics, and more precise gameplay.</p>
<p>We brought in a few developers to see what they could do with it,</p>
<p>and the results were amazing.</p>
<p>Joe: Alright, let‚Äôs go. [laughs]</p>
<p>I work on a title called Marvel: Future Revolution.</p>
<p>Kyle: I am the Senior Design Evangelist for Adobe.</p>
<p>I work on Adobe Fresco.</p>
<p>Tommy: And I am the Founder and CTO of Super Evil Megacorp.</p>
<p>Catalyst Black is really a rich and detailed world</p>
<p>and ProMotion‚Äôs adaptive frame rate is really unique.</p>
<p>Because of the 120 frames per second, you can get perfect response time.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs about the refresh rate, it‚Äôs about the controls.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs almost like your fingers are glued to the screen</p>
<p>Kyle: A device like this changes the game for artists everywhere.</p>
<p>With ProMotion, it means that I‚Äôm actually seeing</p>
<p>the pixels move in real time.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no lag.</p>
<p>Joe: Super Retina XDR display allows</p>
<p>the gamers to see further into the distance</p>
<p>and catch more details and surroundings.</p>
<p>So we have all these great characters. They need to look better than real.</p>
<p>Tommy: The iPhone 13 Pro has</p>
<p>one of the most powerful mobile GPUs ever created,</p>
<p>and with that, we can really bring</p>
<p>all these graphics features to the mobile device.</p>
<p>Joe: I like that part.</p>
<p>Tommy: The incredible combination of A15 Bionic, ProMotion, and 5G</p>
<p>makes the iPhone 13 Pro the most powerful smartphone in the world,</p>
<p>or any world, for that matter.</p>
<p>Joz: The new Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion comes in two great sizes,</p>
<p>6.1-inch and 6.7-inch.</p>
<p>And the custom-designed OLED panels work across different lighting conditions</p>
<p>and content types, maintaining incredible color accuracy and contrast.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about the all-new iPhone 13 Pro camera system.</p>
<p>This is our biggest camera advancement ever.</p>
<p>To tell you more about it, here&rsquo;s Louis.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>
<p>Louis: iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max introduce an all-new camera system,</p>
<p>starting with a new 77-millimeter telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom,</p>
<p>a new Ultra Wide camera with auto-focus and a larger f/1.8 aperture</p>
<p>with a 92% improvement in low light,</p>
<p>and a new Wide camera that has a larger f/1.5 aperture</p>
<p>and 1.9 micron pixels for our largest sensor ever,</p>
<p>with up to 2.2 times improvement in low light.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll get beautiful photos in any situation.</p>
<p>The larger sensor of the Wide offers more light gathering for less noise</p>
<p>and faster shutter speeds and even longer brackets</p>
<p>when shooting night mode photos with a tripod.</p>
<p>The new 77-millimeter telephoto enables beautiful, classic portraiture photos</p>
<p>and 3X optical zoom for photos and videos</p>
<p>for a total 6X optical zoom range on iPhone 13 Pro.</p>
<p>With the new Ultra Wide, low light photos are brighter and sharper</p>
<p>with more details, like you see in her dress or on the couch.</p>
<p>The Ultra Wide camera also enables something entirely new on iPhone,</p>
<p>Macro Photography.</p>
<p>Macro Photography typically uses a special lens</p>
<p>that can focus at close distances.</p>
<p>The new Ultra Wide lens design and auto-focus system</p>
<p>enable incredibly sharp focus</p>
<p>and can magnify subjects with a minimum distance of 2 centimeters.</p>
<p>So you can get detailed close ups,</p>
<p>like of this beautiful red daisy, the cells in this leaf,</p>
<p>or the water droplets on this mushroom.</p>
<p>And for the first time, all of the cameras,</p>
<p>including the telephoto, have night mode,</p>
<p>which is made possible by advanced computational photography.</p>
<p>With tight integration between hardware and software,</p>
<p>our cameras can do even more.</p>
<p>To tell you all about it, here&rsquo;s Rebecca.</p>
<p>Rebecca: When tuning the iPhone camera system,</p>
<p>we shoot and review thousands of photos.</p>
<p>Analyzing all of those photos allows us to deliver features,</p>
<p>like Smart HDR 4,</p>
<p>which automatically brings improved color,</p>
<p>contrast, and lighting for each subject in a group photo,</p>
<p>including for challenging shots like this.</p>
<p>Our software in ISP adjusts for different lighting,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve made improvements for skin tones,</p>
<p>so everyone looks even better.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also introducing a way to personalize your iPhone camera</p>
<p>with Photographic Styles.</p>
<p>This is a feature that pro photographers are going to love.</p>
<p>Photographic Styles bring your individual preferences</p>
<p>right into our advanced image pipeline,</p>
<p>applying local edits like a photo editor would,</p>
<p>but in real time as we render the photo.</p>
<p>That means you get all the benefits of our multi-frame image processing pipeline</p>
<p>with the ability to customize it in a way you could never achieve</p>
<p>with a simple filter.</p>
<p>Select from one of our four default styles before you shoot.</p>
<p>For example, Rich Contrast for a bolder look</p>
<p>or Vibrant for a punchier look.</p>
<p>Each uses our deep semantic understanding</p>
<p>to intelligently apply the right amount of adjustments</p>
<p>to different parts of the photo while preserving skin tones.</p>
<p>You can also customize the styles further with tone and warmth,</p>
<p>which combine multiple attributes for a look that&rsquo;s all your own.</p>
<p>Styles works across scenes and subject types.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to set it every time,</p>
<p>so you can define your style and use it across your photos.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s Photographic Styles coming to iPhone 13 Pro,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re excited to bring it to iPhone 13 as well.</p>
<p>Now back to Joz.</p>
<p>Joz: The all-new Pro camera system combined with the power</p>
<p>of computational photography will allow users</p>
<p>to capture beautiful images better than ever before.</p>
<p>The new iPhone 13 Pro camera system</p>
<p>also provides our most advanced video features.</p>
<p>The all-new camera system, along with Dolby Vision HDR recording,</p>
<p>produces incredible Pro-level video.</p>
<p>So we asked two-time Academy Award winning director Kathryn Bigelow</p>
<p>and Oscar-nominated cinematographer Greig Fraser</p>
<p>to show us what they can do with the power of iPhone 13 Pro.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>
<p>Kathryn: It‚Äôs a completely integrated process now.</p>
<p>The iPhone doesn‚Äôt require any ancillary pieces of equipment.</p>
<p>Like, it becomes still, and she turns slowly.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs the dawning realization.</p>
<p>I thought it was a good challenge.</p>
<p>You know, these are all genres I love.</p>
<p>And it‚Äôs so great to kind of parachute in, do a deep dive with the iPhone.</p>
<p>And with so much accessibility, I think all pretension tends to disappear.</p>
<p>And so it makes the set and the filming process much less apprehensive.</p>
<p>Greig: There was no limitations to what I could do with this particular camera.</p>
<p>Whereas normally, everybody gets so precious about a camera lens.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs so expensive or it‚Äôs so&ndash;it‚Äôs so fragile.</p>
<p>One of the things that the iPhone couldn‚Äôt do up until now</p>
<p>was to create an idea of depth from a lens.</p>
<p>With Cinematic mode, what‚Äôs exciting is, we can actually choose focus later.</p>
<p>To me, that‚Äôs really bringing it up to the professional film cameras.</p>
<p>We can actually go ahead and make these stories</p>
<p>and make these films using the tools on this iPhone.</p>
<p>I believe that with the advent and with the addition of Cinematic mode,</p>
<p>we‚Äôre going to very, very soon see filmmakers make films</p>
<p>in a different way, which is exciting.</p>
<p>Kathryn: It might even birth a brand-new genre.</p>
<p>Greig: I have no doubt it will.</p>
<p>Just given the size and given the ability to move this camera.</p>
<p>Kathryn: Exactly.</p>
<p>Greig: It will change the language of cinema in a very positive way.</p>
<p>[dramatic music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Joz: Everything you just saw, including the behind the scenes footage,</p>
<p>was shot on iPhone 13 Pro.</p>
<p>With major updates across the Wide, Ultra Wide, and Telephoto cameras,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an incredible device for filmmaking.</p>
<p>The new Ultra Wide camera enables amazing macro slo-mo videos</p>
<p>thanks to the new lens design.</p>
<p>And the new 3X telephoto allows you to zoom even closer to the action</p>
<p>and offers a great new focal length for video.</p>
<p>This is really awesome when using our all-new Cinematic mode,</p>
<p>which uses machine learning and disparity to create a depth map</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s built into the video.</p>
<p>So you can change the depth effect, including the level of bokeh</p>
<p>and where the focus is applied, even after the capture.</p>
<p>This is another iPhone first,</p>
<p>as iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro are the only smartphones that can do this.</p>
<p>We also have another Pro video feature coming later this year,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s ProRes video.</p>
<p>ProRes video offers exceptionally high color fidelity</p>
<p>and more efficient encoding for use in pro video editing apps like Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s widely used by video editors as the final delivery format</p>
<p>for commercials, feature films, and broadcast.</p>
<p>A15 Bionic adds hardware acceleration for ProRes.</p>
<p>And in combination with our advanced video encoders and decoders,</p>
<p>as well as our faster file system and flash storage pipeline,</p>
<p>you can now record up to 4K at 30 frames per second in ProRes</p>
<p>right in the Camera app.</p>
<p>iPhone 13 Pro is the only smartphone to provide an end-to-end pro workflow,</p>
<p>allowing you to record and edit in ProRes or Dolby Vision.</p>
<p>This will transform filmmaking</p>
<p>with a device that can simply slip into your pocket.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk about battery life.</p>
<p>This is our most Pro iPhone ever with our fastest performance,</p>
<p>most advanced display,</p>
<p>and most powerful camera system ever in an iPhone.</p>
<p>Thanks to the efficiency of the A15 Bionic and iOS 15,</p>
<p>as well a larger battery,</p>
<p>iPhone 13 Pro delivers incredible all-day battery life.</p>
<p>iPhone 13 Pro lasts more than one and a half hours longer</p>
<p>in your day than iPhone 12 Pro.</p>
<p>And the iPhone 13 Pro Max will last more than two and a half hours longer</p>
<p>than the iPhone 12 Pro Max.</p>
<p>That means iPhone 13 Pro Max has the longest battery life</p>
<p>ever in an iPhone.</p>
<p>The entire iPhone 13 lineup has been carefully designed</p>
<p>to minimize its impact on the environment.</p>
<p>We redesigned the packaging to eliminate the outer plastic wrap,</p>
<p>saving 600 metric tons of plastic.</p>
<p>This brings us closer to our goal of completely removing plastic</p>
<p>from all of our packaging.</p>
<p>iPhone uses 100% recycled rare Earth elements in magnets</p>
<p>and 100% recycled tin in the solder of the main logic board.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s iPhone 13 Pro with our most advanced technologies:</p>
<p>an all-new camera system with three new cameras,</p>
<p>ProRes video, Cinematic mode,</p>
<p>the new Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion,</p>
<p>A15 Bionic with 5-core GPU,</p>
<p>5G, MagSafe,</p>
<p>and incredible durability features.</p>
<p>These iPhones push the boundaries for what&rsquo;s possible in a smartphone.</p>
<p>Even with all this incredible technology,</p>
<p>iPhone 13 Pro still starts at $999.</p>
<p>And iPhone 13 Pro Max still starts at $1,099.</p>
<p>We also have amazing offers from Apple and our partners,</p>
<p>including up to $1,000 off in the U.S. when you trade in a qualifying iPhone.</p>
<p>And this year, we&rsquo;re introducing a new 1-terabyte storage option.</p>
<p>This is a great addition for our Pro iPhone users.</p>
<p>The 1-terabyte joins our 128-, 256-, and 512-gigabyte storage options.</p>
<p>You can pre-order all four new models of iPhone 13 family this Friday,</p>
<p>September 17th,</p>
<p>and they will be available on September 24th.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s our new iPhone lineup,</p>
<p>including iPhone 12,</p>
<p>iPhone 11, and iPhone SE,</p>
<p>starting at just $399.</p>
