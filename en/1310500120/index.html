    <p>The following is a conversation with David Eagleman,</p>
<p>a neuroscientist and one of the great science communicators</p>
<p>of our time, exploring the beauty and mystery</p>
<p>of the human brain.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an author of a lot of amazing books</p>
<p>about the human mind, and his new one called Livewired.</p>
<p>Livewired is a work of 10 years on a topic</p>
<p>that is fascinating to me, which is neuroplasticity</p>
<p>or the malleability of the human brain.</p>

<p>As a side note, let me say that the adaptability</p>
<p>of the human mind at the biological, chemical,</p>
<p>cognitive, psychological, and even sociological levels</p>
<p>is the very thing that captivated me many years ago</p>
<p>when I first began to wonder how would my engineer</p>
<p>something like it in the machine.</p>
<p>The open question today in the 21st century</p>
<p>is what are the limits of this adaptability?</p>
<p>As new, smarter and smarter devices and AI systems</p>
<p>come to life, or as better and better brain computer</p>
<p>interfaces are engineered, will our brain be able to adapt,</p>
<p>to catch up, to excel?</p>
<p>I personally believe yes, that we&rsquo;re far from reaching</p>
<p>the limitation of the human mind and the human brain,</p>
<p>just as we are far from reaching the limitations</p>
<p>of our computational systems.</p>

<p>Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin,</p>
<p>invest in the stock market with as little as $1.</p>
<p>Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin,</p>
<p>let me mention that cryptocurrency</p>
<p>in the context of the history of money is fascinating.</p>
<p>I recommend Ascent of Money as a great book on this history.</p>
<p>Davidson credits on ledgers started around 30,000 years ago</p>
<p>and the first decentralized cryptocurrency</p>
<p>released just over 10 years ago.</p>
<p>So given that history, cryptocurrency is still very much</p>
<p>in its early days of development,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still aiming to</p>
<p>and just might redefine the nature of money.</p>
<p>So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play</p>
<p>and use code lexpodcast, you get $10</p>
<p>and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,</p>
<p>an organization that is helping to advance robotics</p>
<p>and STEM education for young people around the world.</p>
<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with David Eagleman.</p>
<p>You have a new book coming out on the changing brain.</p>
<p>Can you give a high level overview of the book?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Livewired by the way.</p>
<p>Yeah, the thing is we typically think about the brain</p>
<p>in terms of the metaphors we already have,</p>
<p>like hardware and software, that&rsquo;s how we build</p>
<p>all our stuff, but what&rsquo;s happening in the brain</p>
<p>is fundamentally so different.</p>
<p>So I coined this new term liveware,</p>
<p>which is a system that&rsquo;s constantly reconfiguring itself</p>
<p>physically as it learns and adapts to the world around it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s physically changing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s liveware meaning like hardware but changing.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Well, the hardware and the software layers are blended</p>
<p>and so typically engineers are praised for their efficiency</p>
<p>and making something really clean and clear,</p>
<p>like, okay, here&rsquo;s the hardware layer,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m gonna run software on top of it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all sorts of universality that you get out</p>
<p>of a piece of hardware like that that&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>But what the brain is doing is completely different.</p>
<p>And I am so excited about where this is all going</p>
<p>because I feel like this is where our engineering will go.</p>
<p>So currently we build all our devices a particular way,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t tear half the circuitry out of your cell phone</p>
<p>and expect it to still function.</p>
<p>But you can do that with the brain.</p>
<p>So just as an example, kids who are under</p>
<p>about seven years old can get one half of their brain</p>
<p>removed, it&rsquo;s called a hemispherectomy, and they&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>They have a slight limp on the other side of their body,</p>
<p>but they can function just fine that way.</p>
<p>And this is generally true.</p>
<p>You know, sometimes children are born without a hemisphere</p>
<p>and their visual system rewires so that everything is</p>
<p>on the single remaining hemisphere.</p>
<p>What thousands of cases like this teach us</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s a very malleable system that is simply trying</p>
<p>to accomplish the tasks in front of it by rewiring itself</p>
<p>with the available real estate.</p>
<p>How much of that is a quirk or a feature of evolution?</p>
<p>Like, how hard is it to engineer?</p>
<p>Because evolution took a lot of work.</p>
<p>Trillions of organisms had to die for it to create</p>
<p>this thing we have in our skull.</p>
<p>Like, because you said you kind of look forward to the idea</p>
<p>that we might be engineering our systems like this</p>
<p>in the future, like creating liveware systems.</p>
<p>How hard do you think is it to create systems like that?</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>It has proven itself to be a difficult challenge.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is even though it&rsquo;s taken evolution</p>
<p>a really long time to get where it is now,</p>
<p>all we have to do now is peek at the blueprints.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just three pounds, this organ,</p>
<p>and we just figure out how to do it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the part that I mean is a difficult challenge</p>
<p>because there are tens of thousands of neuroscientists,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all poking and prodding and trying to figure this out,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an extremely complicated system.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s only gonna be complicated until we figure out</p>
<p>the general principles.</p>
<p>Exactly like if you had a magic camera</p>
<p>you could look inside the nucleus of a cell</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d see hundreds of thousands of things</p>
<p>moving around or whatever,</p>
<p>and then it takes Crick and Watson to say,</p>
<p>oh, you know what, you&rsquo;re just trying to maintain</p>
<p>the order of the base pairs and all the rest is details.</p>
<p>Then it simplifies it and we come to understand something.</p>
<p>That was my goal in LiveWire,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve written over 10 years, by the way,</p>
<p>is to try to distill things down to the principles</p>
<p>of what plastic systems are trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>But to even just linger, you said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible to be born with just one hemisphere</p>
<p>and you still are able to function.</p>
<p>First of all, just to pause on that,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of, that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if people quite,</p>
<p>I mean, you kind of hear things here and there.</p>
<p>This is why I&rsquo;m kind of, I&rsquo;m really excited about your book</p>
<p>is I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s definitive sort of popular sources</p>
<p>to think about this stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of, I think from my perspective,</p>
<p>what I heard is there&rsquo;s like been debates over decades</p>
<p>about how much neuroplasticity there is in the brain</p>
<p>and so on, and people have learned a lot of things</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s converging towards people</p>
<p>that are understanding there&rsquo;s much more plastic</p>
<p>than people realize.</p>
<p>But just like linger on that topic,</p>
<p>like how malleable is the hardware of the human brain?</p>
<p>Maybe you said children at each stage of life.</p>
<p>Yeah, so here&rsquo;s the whole thing.</p>
<p>I think part of the confusion about plasticity</p>
<p>has been that there are studies</p>
<p>at all sorts of different ages,</p>
<p>and then people might read that from a distance</p>
<p>and they think, oh, well, Fred didn&rsquo;t recover</p>
<p>when half his brain was taken out</p>
<p>and so clearly you&rsquo;re not plastic,</p>
<p>but then you do it with a child and they are plastic.</p>
<p>And so part of my goal here was to pull together</p>
<p>the tens of thousands of papers on this,</p>
<p>both from clinical work and from all the way down</p>
<p>to the molecular and understand</p>
<p>what are the principles here?</p>
<p>The principles are that plasticity diminishes,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s no surprise.</p>
<p>By the way, maybe I should just define plasticity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the ability of a system to mold into a new shape</p>
<p>and then hold that shape.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we make things that we call plastic</p>
<p>because they are moldable and they can hold that new shape,</p>
<p>like a plastic toy or something.</p>
<p>And so maybe we&rsquo;ll use a lot of terms that are synonymous.</p>
<p>So something is plastic, something is malleable,</p>
<p>changing, live wire, the name of the book is like synonyms.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll tell you, exactly right,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll tell you why I chose live wire</p>
<p>instead of plasticity.</p>
<p>So I use the term plasticity in the book, but sparingly,</p>
<p>because that was a term coined by William James</p>
<p>over a hundred years ago and he was, of course,</p>
<p>very impressed with plastic manufacturing</p>
<p>that you could mold something into shape</p>
<p>and then it holds that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s actually happening in the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s constantly rewiring your entire life.</p>
<p>You never hit an end point.</p>
<p>The whole point is for it to keep changing.</p>
<p>So even in the few minutes of conversation</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been having, your brain is changing,</p>
<p>my brain is changing.</p>
<p>Next time I see your face, I will remember,</p>
<p>oh yeah, like that time Lex and I sat together</p>
<p>and we did these things.</p>
<p>I wonder if your brain will have like a Lex thing</p>
<p>going on for the next few months.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;ll stay there until you get rid of it</p>
<p>because it was useful for now.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I&rsquo;ll probably never get rid of it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say for some circumstance,</p>
<p>you and I don&rsquo;t see each other for the next 35 years.</p>
<p>When I run into you, I&rsquo;ll be like, oh yeah.</p>
<p>That looks familiar.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, we sat down for a podcast</p>
<p>back when there were podcasts.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Back when we lived outside virtual reality.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So you chose live wire to mold a plastic.</p>
<p>Exactly, because plastic implies,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the term that&rsquo;s used in the field</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s why we need to use it still for a while.</p>
<p>But yeah, it implies something gets molded into shape</p>
<p>and then holds that shape forever.</p>
<p>But in fact, the whole system is completely changing.</p>
<p>Then back to how malleable is the human brain</p>
<p>at each stage of life.</p>
<p>So what, just at a high level, is it malleable?</p>
<p>So yes, and plasticity diminishes.</p>
<p>But one of the things that I felt like</p>
<p>I was able to put together for myself</p>
<p>after reading thousands of papers on this issue</p>
<p>is that different parts of the brain</p>
<p>have different plasticity windows.</p>
<p>So for example, with the visual cortex,</p>
<p>that cements itself into place pretty quickly</p>
<p>over the course of a few years.</p>
<p>And I argue that&rsquo;s because of the stability of the data.</p>
<p>In other words, what you&rsquo;re getting in from the world,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got a certain number of angles, colors, shapes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essentially the world is visually stable.</p>
<p>So that hardens around that data.</p>
<p>As opposed to, let&rsquo;s say, the somatosensory cortex,</p>
<p>which is the part that&rsquo;s taking information</p>
<p>from your body, or the motor cortex right next to it,</p>
<p>which is what drives your body.</p>
<p>The fact is, bodies are always changing.</p>
<p>You get taller over time, you get fatter, thinner,</p>
<p>over time, you might break a leg</p>
<p>and have to limp for a while, stuff like that.</p>
<p>So because the data there is always changing,</p>
<p>by the way, you might get on a bicycle,</p>
<p>you might get on a surfboard, things like that.</p>
<p>Because the data is always changing,</p>
<p>that stays more malleable.</p>
<p>And when you look through the brain,</p>
<p>you find that it appears to be this,</p>
<p>how stable the data is determines how fast</p>
<p>something hardens into place.</p>
<p>But the point is, different parts of the brain</p>
<p>harden into place at different times.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible that,</p>
<p>depending on how much data you get on different sensors,</p>
<p>that it stays more malleable longer?</p>
<p>So like, if you look at different cultures</p>
<p>that experience, like if you keep your eyes closed,</p>
<p>or maybe you&rsquo;re blind, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say you keep your eyes closed</p>
<p>for your entire life, then the visual cortex</p>
<p>might be much less malleable.</p>
<p>The reason I bring that up is like,</p>
<p>well maybe we&rsquo;ll talk about brain computer interfaces</p>
<p>a little bit down the line, but is this,</p>
<p>is the malleability a genetic thing,</p>
<p>or is it more about the data, like you said, that comes in?</p>
<p>Ah, so the malleability itself is a genetic thing.</p>
<p>The big trick that Mother Nature discovered with humans</p>
<p>is make a system that&rsquo;s really flexible,</p>
<p>as opposed to most other creatures to different degrees.</p>
<p>So if you take an alligator, it&rsquo;s born,</p>
<p>its brain does the same thing every generation.</p>
<p>If you compare an alligator 100,000 years ago</p>
<p>to an alligator now, they&rsquo;re essentially the same.</p>
<p>We, on the other hand, as humans,</p>
<p>drop into a world with a half baked brain,</p>
<p>and what we require is to absorb the culture around us,</p>
<p>and the language, and the beliefs, and the customs,</p>
<p>and so on, that&rsquo;s what Mother Nature has done with us,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been a tremendously successful trick</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve taken over the whole planet as a result of this.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an interesting point,</p>
<p>I mean, just to link on it, that,</p>
<p>I mean, this is a nice feature,</p>
<p>like if you were to design a thing</p>
<p>to survive in this world, do you put it at age zero</p>
<p>already equipped to deal with the world</p>
<p>in a hard coded way, or do you put it,</p>
<p>do you make it malleable and just throw it in,</p>
<p>take the risk that you&rsquo;re maybe going to die,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re going to learn a lot in the process,</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t die, you&rsquo;ll learn a hell of a lot</p>
<p>to be able to survive in the environment.</p>
<p>So this is the experiment that Mother Nature ran,</p>
<p>and it turns out that, for better or worse, we&rsquo;ve won.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, we put other animals in the zoos,</p>
<p>and we, yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>AI might do better.</p>
<p>Okay, fair enough, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And maybe what the trick Mother Nature did</p>
<p>is just the stepping stone to AI, but.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a beautiful feature of the human brain,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s malleable, but let&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>on the topic of Mother Nature, what do we start with?</p>
<p>Like, how blank is the slate?</p>
<p>Ah, so it&rsquo;s not actually a blank slate.</p>
<p>What it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s terrific engineering that&rsquo;s set up in there,</p>
<p>but much of that engineering has to do with,</p>
<p>okay, just make sure that things get to the right place.</p>
<p>For example, like the fibers from the eyes</p>
<p>getting to the visual cortex,</p>
<p>or all this very complicated machinery in the ear</p>
<p>getting to the auditory cortex, and so on.</p>
<p>So things, first of all, there&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>And then what we also come equipped with</p>
<p>is the ability to absorb language</p>
<p>and culture and beliefs, and so on.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re already set up for that.</p>
<p>So no matter what you&rsquo;re exposed to,</p>
<p>you will absorb some sort of language.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the trick, is how do you engineer something</p>
<p>just enough that it&rsquo;s then a sponge</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ready to take in and fill in the blanks?</p>
<p>How much of the malleability is hardware?</p>
<p>How much is software?</p>
<p>Is that useful at all in the brain?</p>
<p>So what are we talking about?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s neurons, there&rsquo;s synapses,</p>
<p>and all kinds of different synapses,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s chemical communication,</p>
<p>like electrical signals,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s chemical communication from the synapses.</p>
<p>I would say the software would be the timing</p>
<p>and the nature of the electrical signals, I guess,</p>
<p>and the hardware would be the actual synapses.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the thing, this is why I really, if we can,</p>
<p>I wanna get away from the hardware and software metaphor</p>
<p>because what happens is,</p>
<p>as activity passes through the system, it changes things.</p>
<p>Now, the thing that computer engineers</p>
<p>are really used to thinking about is synapses,</p>
<p>where two neurons connect.</p>
<p>Of course, each neuron connects with 10,000 of its neighbors,</p>
<p>but at a point where they connect,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re all used to thinking about</p>
<p>is the changing of the strength of that connection,</p>
<p>the synaptic weight.</p>
<p>But in fact, everything is changing.</p>
<p>The receptor distribution inside that neuron</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;re more or less sensitive</p>
<p>to the neurotransmitter,</p>
<p>then the structure of the neuron itself</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s happening there,</p>
<p>all the way down to biochemical cascades inside the cell,</p>
<p>all the way down to the nucleus,</p>
<p>and for example, the epigenome,</p>
<p>which is these little proteins that are attached to the DNA</p>
<p>that cause conformational changes,</p>
<p>that cause more genes to be expressed or repressed.</p>
<p>All of these things are plastic.</p>
<p>The reason that most people only talk</p>
<p>about the synaptic weights</p>
<p>is because that&rsquo;s really all we can measure well.</p>
<p>And all this other stuff is really, really hard to see</p>
<p>with our current technology.</p>
<p>So essentially, that just gets ignored.</p>
<p>But in fact, the system is plastic</p>
<p>at all these different levels.</p>
<p>And my way of thinking about this</p>
<p>is an analogy to pace layers.</p>
<p>So pace layers is a concept that Stewart Brand</p>
<p>suggested about how to think about cities.</p>
<p>So you have fashion, which changes rapidly in cities.</p>
<p>You have governance, which changes more slowly.</p>
<p>You have the structure, the buildings of a city,</p>
<p>which changes more slowly, all the way down to nature.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got all these different layers of things</p>
<p>that are changing at different paces, at different speeds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken that idea and mapped it onto the brain,</p>
<p>which is to say you have some biochemical cascades</p>
<p>that are just changing really rapidly</p>
<p>when something happens, all the way down to things</p>
<p>that are more and more cemented in there.</p>
<p>And this actually allows us to understand a lot</p>
<p>about particular kinds of things that happen.</p>
<p>For example, one of the oldest,</p>
<p>probably the oldest rule in neurology</p>
<p>is called Ribot&rsquo;s Law, which is that older memories</p>
<p>are more stable than newer memories.</p>
<p>So when you get old and demented,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to remember things from your young life.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ll remember this podcast,</p>
<p>but you won&rsquo;t remember what you did</p>
<p>a month ago or a year ago.</p>
<p>And this is a very weird structure, right?</p>
<p>No other system works this way,</p>
<p>where older memories are more stable than newer memories.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s because through time,</p>
<p>things get more and more cemented</p>
<p>into deeper layers of the system.</p>
<p>And so this is, I think, the way we have to think</p>
<p>about the brain, not as, okay, you&rsquo;ve got neurons,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got synaptic weights, and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>So, yeah, so the idea of LiveWare and LiveWired</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s like a, it&rsquo;s a gradual, yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a gradual spectrum between software and hardware.</p>
<p>And so the metaphors completely doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>Cause like when you talk about software and hardware,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard lines.</p>
<p>I mean, of course, software is unlike hard,</p>
<p>but even hardware, but like, so there&rsquo;s two groups,</p>
<p>but in the software world,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s levels of abstractions, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the operating system, there&rsquo;s machine code,</p>
<p>and then it gets higher and higher levels.</p>
<p>But somehow that&rsquo;s actually fundamentally different</p>
<p>than the layers of abstractions in the hardware.</p>
<p>But in the brain, it&rsquo;s all like the same.</p>
<p>And I love the city, the city metaphor.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, it&rsquo;s kind of mind blowing</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s hard to know what to think about that.</p>
<p>Like if I were to ask the question,</p>
<p>this is an important question for machine learning is,</p>
<p>how does the brain learn?</p>
<p>So essentially you&rsquo;re saying that,</p>
<p>I mean, it just learns on all of these different levels</p>
<p>at all different paces.</p>
<p>Exactly right.</p>
<p>And as a result, what happens is</p>
<p>as you practice something, you get good at something,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re physically changing the circuitry,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re adapting your brain around the thing</p>
<p>that is relevant to you.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you take up, do you know how to surf?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you take up surfing now at this age.</p>
<p>What happens is you&rsquo;ll be terrible at first,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know how to operate your body,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know how to read the waves, things like that.</p>
<p>And through time you get better and better.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re burning that</p>
<p>into the actual circuitry of your brain.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re of course conscious when you&rsquo;re first doing it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking about, okay, where am I doing?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s my body weight?</p>
<p>But eventually when you become a pro at it,</p>
<p>you are not conscious of it at all.</p>
<p>In fact, you can&rsquo;t even unpack what it is that you did.</p>
<p>Think about riding a bicycle.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t describe how you&rsquo;re doing it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just doing it, you&rsquo;re changing your balance</p>
<p>when you come, you know, you do this to go to a stop.</p>
<p>So this is what we&rsquo;re constantly doing</p>
<p>is actually shaping our own circuitry</p>
<p>based on what is relevant for us.</p>
<p>Survival, of course, being the top thing that&rsquo;s relevant.</p>
<p>But interestingly, especially with humans,</p>
<p>we have these particular goals in our lives,</p>
<p>computer science, neuroscience, whatever.</p>
<p>And so we actually shape our circuitry around that.</p>
<p>I mean, you mentioned this gets slower and slower with age,</p>
<p>but is there, like I think I&rsquo;ve read and spoken offline,</p>
<p>even on this podcast with a developmental neurobiologist,</p>
<p>I guess would be the right terminology,</p>
<p>is like looking at the very early,</p>
<p>like from embryonic stem cells to the creation of the brain.</p>
<p>And like, that&rsquo;s mind blowing how much stuff happens there.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very malleable at that stage.</p>
<p>And then, but after that,</p>
<p>at which point does it stop being malleable?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the interesting thing</p>
<p>is that it remains malleable your whole life.</p>
<p>So even when you&rsquo;re an old person,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to remember new faces and names,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to learn new sorts of tasks.</p>
<p>And thank goodness,</p>
<p>cause the world is changing rapidly</p>
<p>in terms of technology and so on.</p>
<p>I just sent my mother an Alexa</p>
<p>and she figured out how to go on the settings</p>
<p>and do the thing.</p>
<p>And I was really impressed that she was able to do it.</p>
<p>So there are parts of the brain</p>
<p>that remain malleable their whole life.</p>
<p>The interesting part is that really your goal</p>
<p>is to make an internal model of the world.</p>
<p>Your goal is to say, okay,</p>
<p>the brain is trapped in silence and darkness,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s trying to understand</p>
<p>how the world works out there, right?</p>
<p>I love that image.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess it is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You forget, it&rsquo;s like this lonely thing</p>
<p>is sitting in its own container</p>
<p>and trying to actually throw a few sensors,</p>
<p>figure out what the hell&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>You know what I sometimes think about</p>
<p>is that movie, The Martian with Matt Damon,</p>
<p>the, I mean, it was written in a book, of course,</p>
<p>but the movie poster shows Matt Damon</p>
<p>all alone on the red planet.</p>
<p>And I think, God, that&rsquo;s actually what it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>to be inside your head and my head and anybody&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re essentially on your own planet in there.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m essentially on my own planet.</p>
<p>And everyone&rsquo;s got their own world</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve absorbed all of your experiences</p>
<p>up to this moment in your life</p>
<p>that have made you exactly who you are</p>
<p>and same for me and everyone.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got this very thin bandwidth of communication.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll say something like,</p>
<p>oh yeah, that tastes just like peaches.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll say, oh, I know what you mean.</p>
<p>But the experience, of course,</p>
<p>might be vastly different for us.</p>
<p>But anyway, yes.</p>
<p>So the brain is trapped in silence and darkness,</p>
<p>each one of us, and what it&rsquo;s trying to do,</p>
<p>this is the important part,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s trying to make an internal model</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s going on out there,</p>
<p>as in how do I function in the world?</p>
<p>How do I interact with other people?</p>
<p>Do I say something nice and polite?</p>
<p>Do I say something aggressive and mean?</p>
<p>Do I, you know, all these things</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s putting together about the world.</p>
<p>And I think what happens when people get older and older,</p>
<p>it may not be that plasticity is diminishing.</p>
<p>It may be that their internal model essentially</p>
<p>has set itself up in a way where it says,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;ve pretty much got</p>
<p>a really good understanding of the world now,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t really need to change, right?</p>
<p>So when much older people find themselves</p>
<p>in a situation where they need to change,</p>
<p>they can actually are able to do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that I think this notion</p>
<p>that we all have that plasticity diminishes</p>
<p>as we grow older is in part</p>
<p>because the motivation isn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>But if you were 80 and you get fired from your job</p>
<p>and suddenly had to figure out</p>
<p>how to program a WordPress site or something,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d figure it out.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So the capability, the possibility of change is there.</p>
<p>But then that&rsquo;s the highest challenge,</p>
<p>the interesting challenge to this plasticity,</p>
<p>to this liveware system.</p>
<p>If we could talk about brain computer interfaces</p>
<p>and Neuralink, what are your thoughts</p>
<p>about the efforts of Elon Musk, Neuralink, BCI in general</p>
<p>in this regard, which is adding a machine,</p>
<p>a computer, the capability of a computer</p>
<p>to communicate with the brain</p>
<p>and the brain to communicate with a computer</p>
<p>at the very basic applications</p>
<p>and then like the futuristic kind of thoughts.</p>
<p>Yeah, first of all, it&rsquo;s terrific</p>
<p>that people are jumping in and doing that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s clearly the future.</p>
<p>The interesting part is our brains have pretty good methods</p>
<p>of interacting with technology.</p>
<p>So maybe it&rsquo;s your fat thumbs on a cell phone or something,</p>
<p>but, or maybe it&rsquo;s watching a YouTube video</p>
<p>and getting into your eye that way.</p>
<p>But we have pretty rapid ways of communicating</p>
<p>with technology and getting data.</p>
<p>So if you actually crack open the skull</p>
<p>and go into the inner sanctum of the brain,</p>
<p>you might be able to get a little bit faster,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll tell you, I&rsquo;m not so sanguine</p>
<p>on the future of that as a business.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you why.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because there are various ways</p>
<p>of getting data in and out</p>
<p>and an open head surgery is a big deal.</p>
<p>Neurosurgeons don&rsquo;t wanna do it</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s always risk of death</p>
<p>and infection on the table.</p>
<p>And also it&rsquo;s not clear how many people would say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna volunteer to get something in my head</p>
<p>so that I can text faster, 20% faster.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s, mother nature surrounds the brain</p>
<p>with this armored bunker of the skull</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a very delicate material.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an expression in neurosurgery</p>
<p>about the brain is,</p>
<p>the person is never the same after you open up their skull.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not that&rsquo;s true or whatever, who cares?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a big deal to do an open head surgery.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m interested in is how can we get information</p>
<p>in and out of the brain</p>
<p>without having to crack the skull open?</p>
<p>Without messing with the biological part,</p>
<p>directly connecting or messing</p>
<p>with the intricate biological thing that we got going on</p>
<p>and it seems to be working.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And by the way, where Neuralink is going,</p>
<p>which is wonderful, is going to be in patient cases.</p>
<p>It really matters for all kinds of surgeries</p>
<p>that a person needs,</p>
<p>whether for Parkinson&rsquo;s or epilepsy or whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a terrific new technology</p>
<p>for essentially sewing electrodes in there</p>
<p>and getting more higher density of electrodes.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think as far as the future of BCI goes,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t suspect that people will go in and say,</p>
<p>yeah, drill a hole in my head and do this.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>because I think there&rsquo;s a similar intuition</p>
<p>but say in the world of autonomous vehicles</p>
<p>that folks know how hard it is</p>
<p>and it seems damn impossible.</p>
<p>The similar intuition about,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sticking on the Elon Musk thing</p>
<p>is just a good, easy example.</p>
<p>Similar intuition about colonizing Mars,</p>
<p>it like, if you really think about it,</p>
<p>it seems extremely difficult.</p>
<p>And almost, I mean, just technically difficult</p>
<p>to a degree where you wanna ask,</p>
<p>is it really worth doing, worth trying?</p>
<p>And then the same is applied with BCI.</p>
<p>But the thing about the future</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s hard to predict.</p>
<p>So the exciting thing to me with,</p>
<p>so once it does, once if successful,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s able to help patients,</p>
<p>it may be able to discover something very surprising</p>
<p>of our ability to directly communicate with the brain.</p>
<p>So exactly what you&rsquo;re interested in is figuring out</p>
<p>how to play with this malleable brain,</p>
<p>but like help assist it somehow.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s such a compelling notion to me</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re now working on</p>
<p>all these exciting machine learning systems</p>
<p>that are able to learn from data.</p>
<p>And then if we can have this other brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a learning system,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s live wired on the human side</p>
<p>and them to be able to communicate,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a self play mechanism</p>
<p>was able to beat the world champion at Go.</p>
<p>So they can play with each other,</p>
<p>the computer and the brain, like when you sleep.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of futuristic kind of things</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s just exciting possibilities,</p>
<p>but I hear you, we understand so little</p>
<p>about the actual intricacies of the communication</p>
<p>of the brain that it&rsquo;s hard to find the common language.</p>
<p>Well, interestingly, the technologies that have been built</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t actually require the perfect common language.</p>
<p>So for example, hundreds of thousands of people</p>
<p>are walking around with artificial ears</p>
<p>and artificial eyes,</p>
<p>meaning cochlear implants or retinal implants.</p>
<p>So this is, you take a essentially digital microphone,</p>
<p>you slip an electrode strip into the inner ear</p>
<p>and people can learn how to hear that way,</p>
<p>or you take an electrode grid</p>
<p>and you plug it into the retina at the back of the eye</p>
<p>and people can learn how to see that way.</p>
<p>The interesting part is those devices</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t speak exactly the natural biological language,</p>
<p>they speak the dialect of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>And it turns out that as recently as about 25 years ago,</p>
<p>a lot of people thought this was never gonna work.</p>
<p>They thought it wasn&rsquo;t gonna work for that reason,</p>
<p>but the brain figures it out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really good at saying, okay, look,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some correlation between what I can touch</p>
<p>and feel and hear and so on,</p>
<p>and the data that&rsquo;s coming in,</p>
<p>or between I clap my hands and I have signals coming in there</p>
<p>and it figures out how to speak any language.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So like no matter if it&rsquo;s Neuralink,</p>
<p>so directly communicating with the brain,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s a smartphone or Google Glass,</p>
<p>or the brain figures out the efficient way of communication.</p>
<p>Well, exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>And what I propose is the potato head theory of evolution,</p>
<p>which is that all our eyes and nose and mouth and ears</p>
<p>and fingertips, all this stuff is just plug and play.</p>
<p>And the brain can figure out</p>
<p>what to do with the data that comes in.</p>
<p>And part of the reason that I think this is right,</p>
<p>and I care so deeply about this,</p>
<p>is when you look across the animal kingdom,</p>
<p>you find all kinds of weird peripheral devices plugged in,</p>
<p>and the brain figures out what to do with the data.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t believe that Mother Nature</p>
<p>has to reinvent the principles of brain operation each time</p>
<p>to say, oh, now I&rsquo;m gonna have heat pits</p>
<p>to detect infrared.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m gonna have something</p>
<p>to detect electroreceptors on the body.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m gonna detect something</p>
<p>to pick up the magnetic field of the earth</p>
<p>with cryptochromes in the eye.</p>
<p>And so instead the brain says, oh, I got it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s data coming in.</p>
<p>Is that useful?</p>
<p>Can I do something with it?</p>
<p>Oh, great, I&rsquo;m gonna mold myself</p>
<p>around the data that&rsquo;s coming in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of fascinating to think that,</p>
<p>we think of smartphones</p>
<p>and all this new technology as novel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s totally novel as outside of what evolution</p>
<p>ever intended or like what nature ever intended.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to think that like the entirety</p>
<p>of the process of evolution is perfectly fine</p>
<p>and ready for the smartphone and the internet.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s ready.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ready to be valuable to that.</p>
<p>And whatever comes to cyborgs, to virtual reality,</p>
<p>we kind of think like, this is, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all these like books written about what&rsquo;s natural</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re like destroying our natural cells</p>
<p>by like embracing all this technology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of, you know,</p>
<p>probably not giving the brain enough credit.</p>
<p>Like this thing is just fine with new tech.</p>
<p>Oh, exactly, it wraps itself around.</p>
<p>And by the way, wait till you have kids.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see the ease with which they pick up on stuff.</p>
<p>And as Kevin Kelly said,</p>
<p>technology is what gets invented after you&rsquo;re born.</p>
<p>But the stuff that already exists when you&rsquo;re born,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not even tech, that&rsquo;s just background furniture.</p>
<p>Like the fact that the iPad exists for my son and daughter,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s just background furniture.</p>
<p>So, yeah, it&rsquo;s because we have</p>
<p>this incredibly malleable system,</p>
<p>that just absorbs whatever is going on in the world</p>
<p>and learns what to do with it.</p>
<p>So do you think, just to linger for a little bit more,</p>
<p>do you think it&rsquo;s possible to co adjust?</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re kind of, you know,</p>
<p>for the machine to adjust to the brain,</p>
<p>for the brain to adjust to the machine.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s already happening.</p>
<p>Sure, that is what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>So for example, when you put electrodes</p>
<p>in the motor cortex to control a robotic arm</p>
<p>for somebody who&rsquo;s paralyzed,</p>
<p>the engineers do a lot of work to figure out,</p>
<p>okay, what can we do with the algorithm here</p>
<p>so that we can detect what&rsquo;s going on from these cells</p>
<p>and figure out how to best program the robotic arm to move</p>
<p>given the data that we&rsquo;re measuring from these cells.</p>
<p>But also the brain is learning too.</p>
<p>So, you know, the paralyzed woman says,</p>
<p>wait, I&rsquo;m trying to grab this thing.</p>
<p>And by the way, it&rsquo;s all about relevance.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s a piece of food there and she&rsquo;s hungry,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;ll figure out how to get this food into her mouth</p>
<p>with the robotic arm because that is what matters.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s, okay, first of all,</p>
<p>that paints a really promising and beautiful,</p>
<p>for some reason, really optimistic picture</p>
<p>that, you know, our brain is able to adjust to so much.</p>
<p>You know, so many things happened this year, 2020,</p>
<p>that you think like, how are we ever going to deal with it?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s somehow encouraging</p>
<p>and inspiring that like we&rsquo;re going to be okay.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I actually think, so 2020 has been an awful year</p>
<p>for almost everybody in many ways,</p>
<p>but the one silver lining has to do with brain plasticity,</p>
<p>which is to say we&rsquo;ve all been on our, you know,</p>
<p>on our gerbil wheels, we&rsquo;ve all been in our routines.</p>
<p>And, you know, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>our internal models are all about</p>
<p>how do you maximally succeed?</p>
<p>How do you optimize your operation</p>
<p>in this circumstance where you are, right?</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, bang, 2020 comes,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re completely off our wheels.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re having to create new things all the time</p>
<p>and figure out how to do it.</p>
<p>And that is terrific for brain plasticity because,</p>
<p>and we know this because there are very large studies</p>
<p>on older people who stay cognitively active</p>
<p>their whole lives.</p>
<p>Some fraction of them have Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease</p>
<p>physically, but nobody knows that when they&rsquo;re alive.</p>
<p>Even though their brain is getting chewed up</p>
<p>with the ravages of Alzheimer&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>cognitively they&rsquo;re doing just fine.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re challenged all the time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got all these new things going on,</p>
<p>all this novelty, all these responsibilities,</p>
<p>chores, social life, all these things happening.</p>
<p>And as a result, they&rsquo;re constantly building new roadways,</p>
<p>even as parts degrade.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the only good news is that</p>
<p>we are in a situation where suddenly</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t just operate like automata anymore.</p>
<p>We have to think of completely new ways to do things.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why this question popped into my head.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite absurd, but are we gonna be okay?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You said this is the promising silver lining</p>
<p>just from your own,</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;ve written about this and thought about this</p>
<p>outside of maybe even the plasticity of the brain,</p>
<p>but just this whole pandemic kind of changed the way</p>
<p>it knocked us out of this hamster wheel like that of habit.</p>
<p>A lot of people had to reinvent themselves.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, and I have a lot of friends</p>
<p>who either already or are going to lose their business,</p>
<p>is basically it&rsquo;s taking the dreams that people have had</p>
<p>and said this dream, this particular dream you&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>will no longer be possible.</p>
<p>So you have to find something new.</p>
<p>What are your, are we gonna be okay?</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ll be okay in the sense that,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s gonna be a rough time</p>
<p>for many or most people,</p>
<p>but in the sense that it is sometimes useful</p>
<p>to find that what you thought was your dream</p>
<p>was not the thing that you&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>This is obviously the plot in lots of Hollywood movies</p>
<p>that someone says, I&rsquo;m gonna do this,</p>
<p>and then that gets foiled</p>
<p>and they end up doing something better.</p>
<p>But this is true in life.</p>
<p>I mean, in general, even though we plan our lives</p>
<p>as best we can, it&rsquo;s predicated on our notion of,</p>
<p>okay, given everything that&rsquo;s around me,</p>
<p>this is what&rsquo;s possible for me next.</p>
<p>But it takes 2020 to knock you off that</p>
<p>where you think, oh, well, actually,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s something I can be doing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s bigger, that&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, for me, one exciting thing,</p>
<p>and I just talked to Grant Sanderson.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know who he is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a 3Blue1Brown, it&rsquo;s a YouTube channel.</p>
<p>He does, he&rsquo;s a, if you see it, you would recognize it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like a really famous math guy,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a math educator,</p>
<p>and he does these incredible, beautiful videos.</p>
<p>And now I see sort of at MIT,</p>
<p>folks are struggling to try to figure out,</p>
<p>you know, if we do teach remotely,</p>
<p>how do we do it effectively?</p>
<p>So you have these world class researchers</p>
<p>and professors trying to figure out</p>
<p>how to put content online that teaches people.</p>
<p>And to me, a possible future of that is,</p>
<p>you know, Nobel Prize winning faculty become YouTubers.</p>
<p>Like that to me is so exciting, like what Grant said,</p>
<p>which is like the possibility of creating canonical videos</p>
<p>on the thing you&rsquo;re a world expert in.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s so many topics.</p>
<p>It just, the world doesn&rsquo;t, you know, there&rsquo;s faculty.</p>
<p>I mentioned Russ Tedrick.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these people in robotics</p>
<p>that are experts in a particular beautiful field</p>
<p>on which there&rsquo;s only just papers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no popular book.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no clean canonical video</p>
<p>showing the beauty of a subject.</p>
<p>And one possibility is they try to create that</p>
<p>and share it with the world.</p>
<p>This is the beautiful thing.</p>
<p>This of course has been happening for a while already.</p>
<p>I mean, for example, when I go and I give book talks,</p>
<p>often what&rsquo;ll happen is some 13 year old</p>
<p>will come up to me afterwards and say something,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll say, my God, that was so smart.</p>
<p>Like, how did you know that?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll say, oh, I saw it on a Ted talk.</p>
<p>Well, what an amazing opportunity.</p>
<p>Here you got the best person in the world on subject X</p>
<p>giving a 15 minute talk as beautifully as he or she can.</p>
<p>And the 13 year old just grows up with that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the mother&rsquo;s milk, right?</p>
<p>As opposed to when we grew up,</p>
<p>you know, I had whatever homeroom teacher I had</p>
<p>and, you know, whatever classmates I had.</p>
<p>And hopefully that person knew what he or she was teaching</p>
<p>and often didn&rsquo;t and, you know, just made things up.</p>
<p>So the opportunity that has become extraordinary</p>
<p>to get the best of the world.</p>
<p>And the reason this matters, of course,</p>
<p>is because obviously, back to plasticity,</p>
<p>the way that we, the way our brain gets molded</p>
<p>is by absorbing everything from the world,</p>
<p>all of the knowledge and the data and so on that it can get,</p>
<p>and then springboarding off of that.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re in a very lucky time now</p>
<p>because we grew up with a lot of just in case learning.</p>
<p>So, you know, just in case you ever need to know</p>
<p>these dates in Mongolian history, here they are.</p>
<p>But what kids are grown up with now, like my kids,</p>
<p>is tons of just in time learning.</p>
<p>So as soon as they&rsquo;re curious about something,</p>
<p>they ask Alexa, they ask Google Home,</p>
<p>they get the answer right there</p>
<p>in the context of their curiosity.</p>
<p>The reason this matters is because for plasticity to happen,</p>
<p>you need to care, you need to be curious about something.</p>
<p>And this is something, by the way,</p>
<p>that the ancient Romans had noted.</p>
<p>They had outlined seven different levels of learning</p>
<p>and the highest level is when you&rsquo;re curious about a topic.</p>
<p>But anyway, so kids now are getting tons</p>
<p>of just in time learning, and as a result,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna be so much smarter than we are.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just, and we can already see that.</p>
<p>I mean, my boy is eight years old, my girl is five.</p>
<p>But I mean, the things that he knows are amazing</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just him having to do</p>
<p>the rote memorization stuff that we did.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just fascinating what the brain,</p>
<p>what young brains look like now</p>
<p>because of all those TED Talks just loaded in there.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also, I mean, a lot of people, right,</p>
<p>kind of, there&rsquo;s a sense that our attention span</p>
<p>is growing shorter, but it&rsquo;s complicated</p>
<p>because for example, most people, majority of people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the 80 plus percent of people listen</p>
<p>to the entirety of these things,</p>
<p>two, three hours for the podcast,</p>
<p>long form podcasts are becoming more and more popular.</p>
<p>So like that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s all really giant complicated mess.</p>
<p>And the point is that the brain is able to adjust to it</p>
<p>and somehow like form a worldview</p>
<p>within this new medium of like information that we have.</p>
<p>You have like these short tweets</p>
<p>and you have these three, four hour podcasts</p>
<p>and you have Netflix movie.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s adjusting to the entirety</p>
<p>and just absorbing it and taking it all in</p>
<p>and then pops up COVID that forces us all to be home</p>
<p>and it all just adjusts and figures it out.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Been talking about the brain</p>
<p>as if it&rsquo;s something separate from the human</p>
<p>that carries it a little bit.</p>
<p>Like whenever you talk about the brain,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to forget that that&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s us.</p>
<p>Like how much do you,</p>
<p>how much is the whole thing like predetermined?</p>
<p>Like how much is it already encoded in there?</p>
<p>And how much is it the, what&rsquo;s the hit?</p>
<p>The actions, the decisions, the judgments, the&hellip;</p>
<p>You mean like who you are?</p>
<p>Who you are.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah, okay, great question.</p>
<p>Right, so there used to be a big debate</p>
<p>about nature versus nurture.</p>
<p>And we now know that it&rsquo;s always both.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t even separate them</p>
<p>because you come to the table with a certain amount of nature</p>
<p>for example, your whole genome and so on.</p>
<p>The experiences you have in the womb,</p>
<p>like whether your mother is smoking or drinking,</p>
<p>things like that, whether she&rsquo;s stressed, so on.</p>
<p>Those all influence how you&rsquo;re gonna pop out of the womb.</p>
<p>From there, everything is an interaction</p>
<p>between all of your experiences and the nature.</p>
<p>What I mean is, I think of it like a space time cone</p>
<p>where you have, you drop into the world</p>
<p>and depending on the experience that you have,</p>
<p>you might go off in this direction</p>
<p>or that direction or in that direction</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s interaction on the way.</p>
<p>Your experiences determine what happens</p>
<p>with the expression of your genes.</p>
<p>So some genes get repressed, some get expressed and so on.</p>
<p>And you actually become a different person</p>
<p>based on your experiences.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole field called epigenomics,</p>
<p>which is, or epigenetics I should say,</p>
<p>which is about the epigenome.</p>
<p>And that is the layer that sits on top of the DNA</p>
<p>and causes the genes to express differently.</p>
<p>That is directly related to the experiences that you have.</p>
<p>So if, just as an example, they take rat pups</p>
<p>and one group is placed away from their parents</p>
<p>and the other group is groomed and licked</p>
<p>and taken good care of,</p>
<p>that changes their gene expression</p>
<p>for the rest of their life.</p>
<p>They go off in different directions</p>
<p>in this space time cone.</p>
<p>So yeah, this is of course why it matters</p>
<p>that we take care of children and pour money</p>
<p>into things like education and good childcare</p>
<p>and so on for children broadly,</p>
<p>because these formative years matter so much.</p>
<p>So is there a free will?</p>
<p>This is a great question.</p>
<p>I apologize for the absurd high level</p>
<p>philosophical questions.</p>
<p>No, no, these are my favorite kind of questions.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>If you ask most neuroscientists,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll say that we can&rsquo;t really think</p>
<p>of how you would get free will in there</p>
<p>because as far as we can tell, it&rsquo;s a machine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very complicated machine.</p>
<p>Enormously sophisticated, 86 billion neurons,</p>
<p>about the same number of glial cells.</p>
<p>Each of these things is as complicated</p>
<p>as the city of San Francisco.</p>
<p>Each neuron in your head has the entire human genome in it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s expressing millions of gene products.</p>
<p>These are incredibly complicated biochemical cascades.</p>
<p>Each one is connected to 10,000 of its neighbors,</p>
<p>which means you have like half a quadrillion connections</p>
<p>in the brain.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s incredibly complicated thing,</p>
<p>but it is fundamentally appears to just be a machine.</p>
<p>And therefore, if there&rsquo;s nothing in it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not being driven by something else,</p>
<p>then it seems it&rsquo;s hard to understand</p>
<p>where free will would come from.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the camp that pretty much all of us fall into,</p>
<p>but I will say, our science is still quite young.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a fan of the history of science,</p>
<p>and the thing that always strikes me as interesting</p>
<p>is when you look back at any moment in science,</p>
<p>everybody believes something is true,</p>
<p>and they simply didn&rsquo;t know about</p>
<p>what Einstein revealed or whatever.</p>
<p>And so who knows?</p>
<p>And they all feel like that we&rsquo;ve,</p>
<p>at any moment in history,</p>
<p>they all feel like we&rsquo;ve converged to the final answer.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>Like all the pieces of the puzzle are there.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a funny illusion</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s worth getting rid of.</p>
<p>And in fact, this is what drives good science</p>
<p>is recognizing that we don&rsquo;t have most of the puzzle pieces.</p>
<p>So as far as the free will question goes, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>At the moment, it seems, wow,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be really impossible to figure out</p>
<p>how something else could fit in there,</p>
<p>but 100 years from now,</p>
<p>our textbooks might be very different than they are now.</p>
<p>I mean, could I ask you to speculate</p>
<p>where do you think free will could be squeezed into there?</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s that even,</p>
<p>is it possible that our brain just creates</p>
<p>kinds of illusions that are useful for us?</p>
<p>Or like what, where could it possibly be squeezed in?</p>
<p>Well, let me give a speculation answer</p>
<p>to your very nice question,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t, and the listeners of this podcast,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t quote me on this.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying this is what I believe to be true,</p>
<p>but let me just give an example.</p>
<p>I give this at the end of my book, Incognito.</p>
<p>So the whole book of Incognito is about,</p>
<p>all the what&rsquo;s happening in the brain.</p>
<p>And essentially I&rsquo;m saying, look,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s all the reasons to think</p>
<p>that free will probably does not exist.</p>
<p>But at the very end, I say, look,</p>
<p>imagine that you are,</p>
<p>imagine that you&rsquo;re a Kalahari Bushman</p>
<p>and you find a radio in the sand</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this.</p>
<p>And you look at this radio and you realize</p>
<p>that when you turn this knob, you hear voices coming from,</p>
<p>there are voices coming from it.</p>
<p>So being a radio materialist,</p>
<p>you try to figure out like, how does this thing operate?</p>
<p>So you take off the back cover</p>
<p>and you realize there&rsquo;s all these wires.</p>
<p>And when you take out some wires,</p>
<p>the voices get garbled or stop or whatever.</p>
<p>And so what you end up developing is a whole theory</p>
<p>about how this connection, this pattern of wires</p>
<p>gives rise to voices.</p>
<p>But it would never strike you that in distant cities,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a radio tower and there&rsquo;s invisible stuff beaming.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually the origin of the voices.</p>
<p>And this is just necessary for it.</p>
<p>So I mentioned this just as a speculation,</p>
<p>say, look, how would we know,</p>
<p>what we know about the brain for absolutely certain</p>
<p>is that when you damage pieces and parts of it,</p>
<p>things get jumbled up.</p>
<p>But how would you know if there&rsquo;s something else going on</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t see like electromagnetic radiation</p>
<p>that is what&rsquo;s actually generating this?</p>
<p>Yeah, you paint a beautiful example</p>
<p>of how totally,</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t know most of how our universe works,</p>
<p>how totally off base we might be with our science until,</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s inspiring, that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of terrifying, it&rsquo;s humbling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all of the above.</p>
<p>And the important part just to recognize</p>
<p>is that of course we&rsquo;re in the position</p>
<p>of having massive unknowns.</p>
<p>And we have of course the known unknowns</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s all the things we&rsquo;re pursuing in our labs</p>
<p>and trying to figure out that,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s this whole space of unknown unknowns.</p>
<p>Things we haven&rsquo;t even realized we haven&rsquo;t asked yet.</p>
<p>Let me kind of ask a weird, maybe a difficult question,</p>
<p>part that has to do with,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been recently reading a lot about World War II.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently reading a book I recommend for people,</p>
<p>which as a Jew has been difficult to read,</p>
<p>but the rise and fall of the Third Reich.</p>
<p>So let me just ask about like the nature of genius,</p>
<p>the nature of evil.</p>
<p>If we look at somebody like Einstein,</p>
<p>we look at Hitler, Stalin, modern day Jeffrey Epstein,</p>
<p>just folks who through their life have done with Einstein</p>
<p>and works of genius and with the others I mentioned</p>
<p>have done evil on this world.</p>
<p>What do we think about that in a livewired brain?</p>
<p>Like how do we think about these extreme people?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d say.</p>
<p>This is a very big and difficult question,</p>
<p>but what I would say briefly on it is,</p>
<p>first of all, I saw a cover of Time Magazine some years ago</p>
<p>and it was a big sagittal slice of the brain</p>
<p>and it said something like, what makes us good and evil?</p>
<p>And there was a little spot pointing to it</p>
<p>and there was a picture of Gandhi</p>
<p>and there was a little spot that was pointing to Hitler.</p>
<p>And these Time Magazine covers always make me mad</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so goofy to think that we&rsquo;re gonna find</p>
<p>some spot in the brain or something.</p>
<p>Instead, the interesting part is because we&rsquo;re livewired,</p>
<p>we are all about the world and the culture around us.</p>
<p>So somebody like Adolf Hitler got all this positive feedback</p>
<p>about what was going on and the crazier and crazier</p>
<p>the ideas he had and he&rsquo;s like, let&rsquo;s set up death camps</p>
<p>and murder a bunch of people and so on.</p>
<p>Somehow he was getting positive feedback from that</p>
<p>and all these other people, they&rsquo;re all spun each other up.</p>
<p>And you look at anything like, I mean, look at the cultural</p>
<p>revolution in China or the Russian revolution</p>
<p>or things like this where you look at these things,</p>
<p>my God, how do people all behave like this?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s easy to see groups of people spinning themselves up</p>
<p>in particular ways where they all say,</p>
<p>well, would I have thought this was right</p>
<p>in a different circumstance?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but Fred thinks it&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>and Steve thinks it&rsquo;s right,</p>
<p>everyone around me seems to think it&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And so part of the maybe downside of having a livewired brain</p>
<p>is that you can get crowds of people doing things as a group.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting to, we would pinpoint Hitler</p>
<p>as saying that&rsquo;s the evil guy.</p>
<p>But in a sense, I think it was Tolstoy who said</p>
<p>the king becomes slave to the people.</p>
<p>In other words, Hitler was just a representation</p>
<p>of whatever was going on with that huge crowd</p>
<p>that he was surrounded with.</p>
<p>So I only bring that up to say that it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>to say what it is about this person&rsquo;s brain</p>
<p>or that person&rsquo;s brain.</p>
<p>He obviously got feedback for what he was doing.</p>
<p>The other thing, by the way,</p>
<p>about what we often think of as being evil in society</p>
<p>is my lab recently published some work</p>
<p>on in groups and out groups,</p>
<p>which is a very important part of this puzzle.</p>
<p>So it turns out that we are very engineered</p>
<p>to care about in groups versus out groups.</p>
<p>And this seems to be like a really fundamental thing.</p>
<p>So we did this experiment in my lab</p>
<p>where we brought people and we stick them in the scanner.</p>
<p>And we, I don&rsquo;t know if you noticed,</p>
<p>but we show them on the screen six hands</p>
<p>and the computer goes around randomly picks a hand.</p>
<p>And then you see that hand gets stabbed</p>
<p>with a syringe needle.</p>
<p>So you actually see a syringe needle enter the hand</p>
<p>and come out.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really, what that does is that triggers</p>
<p>parts of the pain matrix,</p>
<p>this areas in your brain that are involved</p>
<p>in feeling physical pain.</p>
<p>Now, the interesting thing is it&rsquo;s not your hand</p>
<p>that was stabbed.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re seeing is empathy.</p>
<p>This is you seeing someone else&rsquo;s hand gets stabbed.</p>
<p>You feel like, oh God, this is awful, right?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>We contrast that by the way,</p>
<p>with somebody&rsquo;s hand getting poked as a Q tip,</p>
<p>which is, you know, looks visually the same,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have that same level of response.</p>
<p>Now what we do is we label each hand with a one word label,</p>
<p>Christian, Jewish, Muslim, atheist, Scientologist, Hindu.</p>
<p>And now the computer goes around, picks a hand,</p>
<p>stabs the hand.</p>
<p>And the question is, how much does your brain care</p>
<p>about all the people in your out group</p>
<p>versus the one label that happens to match you?</p>
<p>And it turns out for everybody across all religions,</p>
<p>they care much more about their in group</p>
<p>than their out group.</p>
<p>And when I say they care, what I mean is</p>
<p>you get a bigger response from their brain.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same hands.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a one word label.</p>
<p>You care much more about your in group than your out group.</p>
<p>And I wish this weren&rsquo;t true, but this is how humans are.</p>
<p>I wonder how fundamental that is,</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s the emergent thing about culture.</p>
<p>Like if we lived alone with like,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s genetically built into the brain,</p>
<p>like this longing for tribe.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll tell you, we addressed that.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what we did.</p>
<p>There are two, actually there are two other things</p>
<p>we did as part of this study</p>
<p>that I think matter for this point.</p>
<p>One is, so okay, so we show that you have</p>
<p>a much bigger response.</p>
<p>And by the way, this is not a cognitive thing.</p>
<p>This is a very low level basic response</p>
<p>to seeing pain in somebody, okay.</p>
<p>Great study by the way.</p>
<p>Thanks, thanks, thanks.</p>
<p>What we did next is we next have it where we say,</p>
<p>okay, the year is 2025 and these three religions</p>
<p>are now in a war against these three religions.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all randomized, right?</p>
<p>But what you see is your thing and you have two allies now</p>
<p>against these others.</p>
<p>And now it happens over the course of many trials,</p>
<p>you see everybody gets stabbed at different times.</p>
<p>And the question is, do you care more about your allies?</p>
<p>And the answer is yes.</p>
<p>Suddenly people who a moment ago,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t really care when they got stabbed.</p>
<p>Now, simply with this one word thing</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re now your allies, you care more about them.</p>
<p>But then what I wanted to do was look at</p>
<p>how ingrained is this or how arbitrary is it?</p>
<p>So we brought new participants in and we said,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a coin, toss the coin.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s heads, you&rsquo;re an Augustinian.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a tails, you&rsquo;re a Justinian.</p>
<p>These are totally made up.</p>
<p>Okay, so they toss it, they get whatever.</p>
<p>We give them a band that says Augustinian on it,</p>
<p>whatever tribe they&rsquo;re in now, and they get in the scanner</p>
<p>and they see a thing on the screen that says</p>
<p>the Augustinians and Justinians are two warring tribes.</p>
<p>Then you see a bunch of hands,</p>
<p>some are labeled Augustinians, some are Justinian.</p>
<p>And now you care more about whichever team you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>than the other team, even though it&rsquo;s totally arbitrary</p>
<p>and you know it&rsquo;s arbitrary</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re the one who tossed the coin.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a state that&rsquo;s very easy to find ourselves in.</p>
<p>In other words, just before walking in the door,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d never even heard of Augustinian versus Justinian</p>
<p>and now their brain is representing it</p>
<p>simply because they&rsquo;re told they&rsquo;re on this team.</p>
<p>You know, now I did my own personal study of this.</p>
<p>So once you&rsquo;re an Augustinian, that tends to be sticky</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been a Packers fan,</p>
<p>grew to be a Packers fan my whole life.</p>
<p>Now when I&rsquo;m in Boston with like the Patriots,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been tough going for my livewired brain</p>
<p>to switch to the Patriots.</p>
<p>So once you become, it&rsquo;s as interesting,</p>
<p>once the tribe is sticky.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll admit that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, you know.</p>
<p>You know, we never tried that about saying,</p>
<p>okay, now you&rsquo;re a Justinian and you were an Augustinian.</p>
<p>We never saw how sticky it is.</p>
<p>But there are studies of this,</p>
<p>of monkey troops on some island.</p>
<p>And what happens is they look at the way monkeys behave</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re part of this tribe</p>
<p>and how they treat members of the other tribe of monkeys.</p>
<p>And then what they do, I&rsquo;ve forgotten how they do that,</p>
<p>exactly, but they end up switching a monkey</p>
<p>so he ends up in the other troop.</p>
<p>And very quickly they end up becoming a part</p>
<p>of that other troop and hating and behaving badly</p>
<p>towards the original troop.</p>
<p>These are fascinating studies, by the way.</p>
<p>This is beautiful.</p>
<p>In your book, you have a good light bulb joke.</p>
<p>How many psychiatrists does it take to change a light bulb?</p>
<p>Only one, but the light bulb has to want to change.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a sucker for a good light bulb joke.</p>
<p>Okay, so given, you know, I&rsquo;ve been interested</p>
<p>in psychiatry my whole life, just maybe tangentially.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve kind of early on dreamed to be a psychiatrist</p>
<p>until I understood what it entails.</p>
<p>But, you know, is there hope for psychiatry</p>
<p>for somebody else to help this live, wired brain to adjust?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I mean, in the sense that,</p>
<p>and this has to do with this issue</p>
<p>about us being trapped on our own planet.</p>
<p>Forget psychiatrists, just think of like</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking with a friend</p>
<p>and you say, oh, I&rsquo;m so upset about this.</p>
<p>And your friend says, hey, just look at it this way.</p>
<p>You know, all we have access to under normal circumstances</p>
<p>is just the way we&rsquo;re seeing something.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s super helpful to have friends and communities</p>
<p>and psychiatrists and so on to help things change that way.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how psychiatrists sort of helped us.</p>
<p>But more importantly, the role that psychiatrists have played</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s this sort of naive assumption</p>
<p>that we all come to the table with,</p>
<p>which is that everyone is fundamentally just like us.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re a kid, you believe this entirely,</p>
<p>but as you get older and you start realizing,</p>
<p>okay, there&rsquo;s something called schizophrenia</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a real thing.</p>
<p>And to be inside that person&rsquo;s head is totally different</p>
<p>than what it is to be inside my head or their psychopathy.</p>
<p>And to be inside the psychopath&rsquo;s head,</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t care about other people.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t care about hurting other people.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just doing what he needs to do to get what he needs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a different head.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a million different things going on</p>
<p>and it is different to be inside those heads.</p>
<p>This is where the field of psychiatry comes in.</p>
<p>Now, I think it&rsquo;s an interesting question</p>
<p>about the degree to which neuroscience is leaking into</p>
<p>and taking over psychiatry</p>
<p>and what the landscape will look like 50 years from now.</p>
<p>It may be that psychiatry as a profession changes a lot</p>
<p>or maybe goes away entirely,</p>
<p>and neuroscience will essentially be able</p>
<p>to take over some of these functions,</p>
<p>but it has been extremely useful to understand</p>
<p>the differences between how people behave and why</p>
<p>and what you can tell about what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>inside their brain just based on observation</p>
<p>of their behavior.</p>
<p>This might be years ago, but I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an Atlantic article you&rsquo;ve written</p>
<p>about moving away from a distinction</p>
<p>between neurological disorders,</p>
<p>quote unquote, brain problems,</p>
<p>and psychiatric disorders or quote unquote, mind problems.</p>
<p>So on that topic, how do you think about this gray area?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is exactly the evolution that things are going</p>
<p>is there was psychiatry and then there were guys and gals</p>
<p>in labs poking cells and so on.</p>
<p>Those were the neuroscientists.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think these are moving together</p>
<p>for exactly the reason you just cited.</p>
<p>And where this matters a lot,</p>
<p>the Atlantic article that I wrote</p>
<p>was called The Brain on Trial,</p>
<p>where this matters a lot is the legal system</p>
<p>because the way we run our legal system now,</p>
<p>and this is true everywhere in the world,</p>
<p>is someone shows up in front of the judge&rsquo;s bench,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s five people</p>
<p>in front of the judge&rsquo;s bench,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve all committed the same crime.</p>
<p>What we do, because we feel like, hey, this is fair,</p>
<p>is we say, all right, you&rsquo;re gonna get the same sentence.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll all get three years in prison or whatever it is.</p>
<p>But in fact, brains can be so different.</p>
<p>This guy&rsquo;s got schizophrenia, this guy&rsquo;s a psychopath,</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s tweaked down on drugs, and so on and so on,</p>
<p>that it actually doesn&rsquo;t make sense to keep doing that.</p>
<p>And what we do in this country more than anywhere</p>
<p>in the world is we imagine that incarceration</p>
<p>is a one size fits all solution.</p>
<p>And you may know we have the,</p>
<p>America has the highest incarceration rate</p>
<p>in the whole world in terms of the percentage</p>
<p>of our population we put behind bars.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a much more refined thing we can do</p>
<p>as neuroscience comes in and changes,</p>
<p>and has the opportunity to change the legal system.</p>
<p>Which is to say, this doesn&rsquo;t let anybody off the hook.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t say, oh, it&rsquo;s not your fault, and so on.</p>
<p>But what it does is it changes the equation</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not about, hey, how blameworthy are you?</p>
<p>But instead is about, hey, what do we do from here?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the best thing to do from here?</p>
<p>So if you take somebody with schizophrenia</p>
<p>and you have them break rocks in the hot summer sun</p>
<p>in a chain gang, that doesn&rsquo;t help their schizophrenia.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t fix the problem.</p>
<p>If you take somebody with a drug addiction</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s in jail for being caught with two ounces</p>
<p>of some illegal substance, and you put them in prison,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t actually fix the addiction.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t help anything.</p>
<p>Happily, what neuroscience and psychiatry</p>
<p>bring to the table is lots of really useful things</p>
<p>you can do with schizophrenia, with drug addiction,</p>
<p>things like this.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, so I don&rsquo;t know if you guys</p>
<p>better run a national law and profit</p>
<p>called the Center for Science and Law.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all about this intersection</p>
<p>of neuroscience and psychiatry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the intersection of neuroscience and legal system.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re trying to implement changes</p>
<p>in every county, in every state.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just, without going down that rabbit hole,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just say one of the very simplest things to do</p>
<p>is to set up specialized court systems</p>
<p>where you have a mental health court</p>
<p>that has judges and juries with expertise</p>
<p>in mental illness.</p>
<p>Because if you go, by the way, to a regular court</p>
<p>and the person says, or the defense lawyer says,</p>
<p>this person has schizophrenia, most of the jury will say,</p>
<p>man, I call bullshit on that.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they don&rsquo;t know about schizophrenia.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>And it turns out people who know about schizophrenia</p>
<p>feel very differently as a juror</p>
<p>than someone who happens not to know anybody with</p>
<p>schizophrenia, they think it&rsquo;s an excuse.</p>
<p>So you have judges and juries with expertise</p>
<p>in mental illness and they know the rehabilitative</p>
<p>strategies that are available.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one thing.</p>
<p>Having a drug court where you have judges and juries</p>
<p>with expertise in rehabilitative strategies</p>
<p>and what can be done and so on.</p>
<p>A specialized prostitution court and so on.</p>
<p>All these different things.</p>
<p>By the way, this is very easy for counties</p>
<p>to implement this sort of thing.</p>
<p>And this is, I think, where this matters</p>
<p>to get neuroscience into public policy.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the process of injecting expertise into this?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll tell you exactly what it is.</p>
<p>A county needs to run out of money first.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this happen over and over.</p>
<p>So what happens is a county has a completely full jail</p>
<p>and they say, you know what?</p>
<p>We need to build another jail.</p>
<p>And then they realize, God, we don&rsquo;t have any money.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t afford this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got too many people in jail.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when they turn to,</p>
<p>God, we need something smarter.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when they set up specialized court systems.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all function best when our back is against the wall.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what COVID is good for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;ve all had our routines</p>
<p>and we are optimized for the things we do.</p>
<p>And suddenly our backs are against the wall, all of us.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s really, I mean,</p>
<p>one of the exciting things about COVID.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m a big believer in the possibility</p>
<p>of what government can do for the people.</p>
<p>And when it becomes too big of a bureaucracy,</p>
<p>it starts functioning poorly, it starts wasting money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to, I mean, COVID reveals that nicely.</p>
<p>And lessons to be learned about who gets elected</p>
<p>and who goes into government.</p>
<p>Hopefully this, hopefully this inspires talented</p>
<p>and young people to go into government</p>
<p>to revolutionize different aspects of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s the positive silver lining of COVID.</p>
<p>I mean, I thought it&rsquo;d be fun to ask you,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re paying attention</p>
<p>to the machine learning world and GPT3.</p>
<p>So the GPT3 is this language model,</p>
<p>this neural network that&rsquo;s able to,</p>
<p>it has 175 billion parameters.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very large and it&rsquo;s trained</p>
<p>in an unsupervised way on the internet.</p>
<p>It just reads a lot of unstructured texts</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s able to generate some pretty impressive things.</p>
<p>The human brain compared to that has about,</p>
<p>you know, a thousand times more synapses.</p>
<p>People get so upset when machine learning people</p>
<p>compare the brain and we know synapses are different.</p>
<p>It was very different, very different.</p>
<p>But like, do you, what do you think about GPT3?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I think, here&rsquo;s what I think, a few things.</p>
<p>What GPT3 is doing is extremely impressive,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very different from what the brain does.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a good impersonator, but just as one example,</p>
<p>everybody takes a passage that GPT3 has written</p>
<p>and they say, wow, look at this, and it&rsquo;s pretty good, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s already gone through a filtering process</p>
<p>of humans looking at it and saying,</p>
<p>okay, well that&rsquo;s crap, that&rsquo;s crap, okay.</p>
<p>Oh, here&rsquo;s a sentence that&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>Now here&rsquo;s the thing, human creativity</p>
<p>is about absorbing everything around it</p>
<p>and remixing that and coming up with stuff.</p>
<p>So in that sense, we&rsquo;re sort of like GPT3,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re remixing what we&rsquo;ve gotten in before.</p>
<p>But we also know, we also have very good models</p>
<p>of what it is to be another human.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I don&rsquo;t know if you speak French</p>
<p>or something, but I&rsquo;m not gonna start speaking in French</p>
<p>because then you&rsquo;ll say, wait, what are you doing?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>Instead, everything coming out of my mouth</p>
<p>is meant for your ears.</p>
<p>I know what you&rsquo;ll understand.</p>
<p>I know the vocabulary that you know and don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I know what parts you care about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a huge part of it.</p>
<p>And so of all the possible sentences I could say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m navigating this thin bandwidth</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s something useful for our conversation.</p>
<p>Yeah, in real time, but also throughout your life.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re co evolving together.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re learning how to communicate together.</p>
<p>Exactly, but this is what GPT3 does not do.</p>
<p>All it&rsquo;s doing is saying, okay,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna take all these senses and remix stuff</p>
<p>and pop some stuff out.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t know how to make it</p>
<p>so that you, Lex, will feel like,</p>
<p>oh yeah, that&rsquo;s exactly what I needed to hear.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the next sentence that I needed to know about</p>
<p>for something.</p>
<p>Well, of course, it could be,</p>
<p>all the impressive results we see.</p>
<p>The question is, if you raise the number of parameters,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s going to be after some&hellip;</p>
<p>It will not be.</p>
<p>Raising more parameters won&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t think neural networks</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be like the human brain,</p>
<p>because I suspect they will be at some point, 50 years.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>But what we are missing in artificial neural networks</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;ve got this basic structure where you&rsquo;ve got units</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got synapses that are connected.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s done incredibly mind blowing, impressive things,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not doing the same algorithms as the human brain.</p>
<p>So when I look at my children, as little kids,</p>
<p>as infants, they can do things that no GPT3 can do.</p>
<p>They can navigate a complex room.</p>
<p>They can navigate social conversation with an adult.</p>
<p>They can lie.</p>
<p>They can do a million things.</p>
<p>They are active thinkers in our world and doing things.</p>
<p>And this, of course, I mean, look,</p>
<p>we totally agree on how incredibly awesome</p>
<p>artificial neural networks are right now,</p>
<p>but we also know the things that they can&rsquo;t do well,</p>
<p>like be generally intelligent,</p>
<p>do all these different things.</p>
<p>The reason about the world,</p>
<p>efficiently learn, efficiently adapt.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still the rate of improvement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, to me, it&rsquo;s possible that we&rsquo;ll be surprised.</p>
<p>I agree, possible we&rsquo;ll be surprised.</p>
<p>But what I would assert,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m getting to say this on your podcast,</p>
<p>we can look back at this in two years and 10 years,</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;ve got to be much more sophisticated</p>
<p>than units and synapses between them.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example,</p>
<p>and this is something I talk about in LiveWired,</p>
<p>is despite the amazing impressiveness,</p>
<p>mind blowing impressiveness,</p>
<p>computers don&rsquo;t have some basic things,</p>
<p>artificial neural networks don&rsquo;t have some basic things</p>
<p>that we like caring about relevance, for example.</p>
<p>So as humans, we are confronted</p>
<p>with tons of data all the time,</p>
<p>and we only encode particular things</p>
<p>that are relevant to us.</p>
<p>We have this very deep sense of relevance</p>
<p>that I mentioned earlier is based on survival</p>
<p>at the most basic level,</p>
<p>but then all the things about my life and your life,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s relevant to you, that we encode.</p>
<p>This is very useful.</p>
<p>Computers at the moment don&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t even have a yen to survive</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>So we filled out a bunch of the junk we don&rsquo;t need.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really good at efficiently</p>
<p>zooming in on things we need.</p>
<p>Again, could be argued, you know,</p>
<p>let me put on my Freud hat.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s, I mean, that&rsquo;s our conscious mind.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason that neural networks</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t doing the same kind of filtration.</p>
<p>I mean, in the sense with GPT3 is doing,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a priming step.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s doing an essential kind of filtration</p>
<p>when you ask it to generate tweets from,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, from an Elon Musk or something like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s doing a filtration of it&rsquo;s throwing away</p>
<p>all the parameters it doesn&rsquo;t need for this task.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s figuring out how to do that successfully.</p>
<p>And then ultimately it&rsquo;s not doing a very good job</p>
<p>right now, but it&rsquo;s doing a lot better job</p>
<p>than we expected.</p>
<p>But it won&rsquo;t ever do a really good job.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you why.</p>
<p>I mean, so let&rsquo;s say we say,</p>
<p>hey, produce an Elon Musk tweet.</p>
<p>And we see like, oh, wow, it produced these three.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>But again, we&rsquo;re not seeing the 3000 produced</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t really make any sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because it has no idea what it is like to be a human.</p>
<p>And all the things that you might want to say</p>
<p>and all the reasons you wouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>like when you go to write a tweet,</p>
<p>you might write something you think,</p>
<p>ah, it&rsquo;s not gonna come off quite right</p>
<p>in this modern political climate or whatever.</p>
<p>Like, you know, you can change things.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>And it somehow boils down to fear of mortality</p>
<p>and all of these human things at the end of the day,</p>
<p>all contained with that tweeting experience.</p>
<p>Well, interestingly, the fear of mortality</p>
<p>is at the bottom of this,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve got all these more things like,</p>
<p>you know, oh, I want to,</p>
<p>just in case the chairman of my department reads this,</p>
<p>I want it to come off well there.</p>
<p>Just in case my mom looks at this tweet,</p>
<p>I want to make sure she, you know, and so on.</p>
<p>So those are all the things that humans are able</p>
<p>to sort of throw into the calculation.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>What it required, what it requires though,</p>
<p>is having a model of your chairman,</p>
<p>having a model of your mother,</p>
<p>having a model of, you know,</p>
<p>the person you want to go on a date with</p>
<p>who might look at your tweet and so on.</p>
<p>All these things are,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re running models of what it is like to be them.</p>
<p>So in terms of the structure of the brain,</p>
<p>again, this may be going into speculation land.</p>
<p>I hope you go along with me.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Is, okay, so the brain seems to be intelligent</p>
<p>and our AI systems aren&rsquo;t very currently.</p>
<p>So where do you think intelligence arises in the brain?</p>
<p>Like what is it about the brain?</p>
<p>So if you mean where location wise,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s no single spot.</p>
<p>It would be equivalent to asking,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at New York city,</p>
<p>where is the economy?</p>
<p>The answer is you can&rsquo;t point to anywhere.</p>
<p>The economy is all about the interaction</p>
<p>of all of the pieces and parts of the city.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what, you know, intelligence,</p>
<p>whatever we mean by that in the brain</p>
<p>is interacting from everything going on at once.</p>
<p>In terms of a structure.</p>
<p>So we look humans are much smarter than fish,</p>
<p>maybe not dolphins, but dolphins are mammals, right?</p>
<p>I assert that what we mean by smarter</p>
<p>has to do with live wiring.</p>
<p>So what we mean when we say, oh, we&rsquo;re smart</p>
<p>is, oh, we can figure out a new thing</p>
<p>and figure out a new pathway to get where we need to go.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because fish are essentially coming to the table</p>
<p>with, you know, okay, here&rsquo;s the hardware, go swim, mate.</p>
<p>But we have the capacity to say,</p>
<p>okay, look, I&rsquo;m gonna absorb, oh, oh,</p>
<p>but you know, I saw someone else do this thing</p>
<p>and I read once that you could do this other thing</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>So do you think there&rsquo;s, is there something,</p>
<p>I know these are mysteries,</p>
<p>but like architecturally speaking,</p>
<p>what feature of the brain of the live wire aspect of it</p>
<p>that is really useful for intelligence?</p>
<p>So like, is it the ability of neurons to reconnect?</p>
<p>Like, is there something,</p>
<p>is there any lessons about the human brain</p>
<p>you think might be inspiring for us</p>
<p>to take into the artificial, into the machine learning world?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m actually just trying to write some up on this now</p>
<p>called, you know, if you wanna build a robot,</p>
<p>start with the stomach.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that, what I mean by that is</p>
<p>a robot has to care, it has to have hunger,</p>
<p>it has to care about surviving, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example.</p>
<p>So the penultimate chapter of my book,</p>
<p>I titled The Wolf and the Mars Rover.</p>
<p>And I just look at this simple comparison</p>
<p>of you look at a wolf, it gets its leg caught in a trap.</p>
<p>What does it do?</p>
<p>It gnaws its leg off,</p>
<p>and then it figures out how to walk on three legs.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>Now, the Mars Rover Curiosity got its front wheel stuck</p>
<p>in some Martian soil, and it died.</p>
<p>This project that cost billions of dollars died</p>
<p>because it got its wheels.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be terrific if we could build a robot</p>
<p>that chewed off its front wheel and figured out</p>
<p>how to operate with a slightly different body plan?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of thing that we wanna be able to build.</p>
<p>And to get there, what we need,</p>
<p>the whole reason the wolf is able to do that</p>
<p>is because its motor and somatosensory systems</p>
<p>are live wired.</p>
<p>So it says, oh, you know what?</p>
<p>Turns out we&rsquo;ve got a body plan that&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>than what I thought a few minutes ago,</p>
<p>but I have a yen to survive and I care about relevance,</p>
<p>which in this case is getting to food,</p>
<p>getting back to my pack and so on.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just gonna figure out how to operate with this.</p>
<p>Oh, whoops, that didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, I&rsquo;m kind of getting it to work.</p>
<p>But the Mars Rover doesn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>It just says, oh geez, I was pre programmed.</p>
<p>Four wheels, now I have three, I&rsquo;m screwed.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar</p>
<p>with a philosopher named Ernest Becker.</p>
<p>He wrote a book called Denial of Death.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a few psychologists, Sheldon Solomon,</p>
<p>I think I just spoke with him on his podcast</p>
<p>who developed terror management theory,</p>
<p>which is like Ernest Becker is a philosopher</p>
<p>that basically said that fear of mortality</p>
<p>is at the core of it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t know if it sounds compelling as an idea</p>
<p>that all of the civilization we&rsquo;ve constructed</p>
<p>is based on this, but it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m familiar with his work.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I think.</p>
<p>I think that yes, fundamentally this desire to survive</p>
<p>is at the core of it, I would agree with that.</p>
<p>But how that expresses itself in your life</p>
<p>ends up being very different.</p>
<p>The reason you do what you do is, I mean,</p>
<p>you could list the 100 reasons why you chose</p>
<p>to write your tweet this way and that way.</p>
<p>And it really has nothing to do with the survival part.</p>
<p>It has to do with, you know, trying to impress fellow humans</p>
<p>and surprise them and say something.</p>
<p>Yeah, so many things built on top of each other,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s fascinating to think</p>
<p>that in artificial intelligence systems,</p>
<p>we wanna be able to somehow engineer this drive</p>
<p>for survival, for immortality.</p>
<p>I mean, because as humans, we&rsquo;re not just about survival,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re aware of the fact that we&rsquo;re going to die,</p>
<p>which is a very kind of, we&rsquo;re aware of like space time.</p>
<p>Most people aren&rsquo;t, by the way.</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Confucius said, he said, each person has two lives.</p>
<p>The second one begins when you realize</p>
<p>that you have just one.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But most people, it takes a long time</p>
<p>for most people to get there.</p>
<p>I mean, you could argue this kind of Freudian thing,</p>
<p>which Erzbecker argues is they actually figured it out</p>
<p>early on and the terror they felt</p>
<p>was like the reason it&rsquo;s been suppressed.</p>
<p>And the reason most people, when I ask them</p>
<p>about whether they&rsquo;re afraid of death,</p>
<p>they basically say no.</p>
<p>They basically say like, I&rsquo;m afraid I won&rsquo;t get,</p>
<p>like submit the paper before I die.</p>
<p>Like they kind of see, they see death</p>
<p>as a kind of a inconvenient deadline</p>
<p>for a particular set of, like a book you&rsquo;re writing.</p>
<p>As opposed to like, what the hell?</p>
<p>This thing ends at any moment.</p>
<p>Like most people, as I&rsquo;ve encountered,</p>
<p>do not meditate on the idea that like right now</p>
<p>you could die.</p>
<p>Like right now, like in the next five minutes,</p>
<p>it could be all over and, you know, meditate on that idea.</p>
<p>I think that somehow brings you closer</p>
<p>to like the core of the motivations</p>
<p>and the core of the human cognition condition.</p>
<p>I think it might be the core, but like I said,</p>
<p>it is not what drives us day to day.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s so many things on top of it,</p>
<p>but it is interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, as the ancient poet said,</p>
<p>death whispers at my ear, live for I come.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, it is certainly motivating</p>
<p>when we think about that.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ve got some deadline.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly when it is,</p>
<p>but I better make stuff happen.</p>
<p>It is motivating, but I don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>I mean, I know for just speaking for me personally,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not what motivates me day to day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s instead, oh, I want to get this, you know,</p>
<p>program up and running before this,</p>
<p>or I want to make sure my coauthor isn&rsquo;t mad at me</p>
<p>because I haven&rsquo;t gotten this in,</p>
<p>or I don&rsquo;t want to miss this grant deadline,</p>
<p>or, you know, whatever the thing is.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s too distant in a sense.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is good to reconnect.</p>
<p>But for the AI systems, none of that is there.</p>
<p>Like a neural network does not fear its mortality.</p>
<p>And that seems to be somehow</p>
<p>fundamentally missing the point.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s missing the point,</p>
<p>but I wonder, it&rsquo;s an interesting speculation</p>
<p>about whether you can build an AI system</p>
<p>that is much closer to being a human</p>
<p>without the mortality and survival piece,</p>
<p>but just the thing of relevance,</p>
<p>just I care about this versus that.</p>
<p>Right now, if you have a robot roll into the room,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be frozen</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t have any reason to go there versus there.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have any particular set of things</p>
<p>about this is how I should navigate my next move</p>
<p>because I want something.</p>
<p>Yeah, the thing about humans</p>
<p>is they seem to generate goals.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, you said livewired.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s very flexible in terms of the goals</p>
<p>and creative in terms of the goals we generate</p>
<p>when we enter a room.</p>
<p>You show up to a party without a goal,</p>
<p>usually, and then you figure it out along the way.</p>
<p>Yes, but this goes back to the question about free will,</p>
<p>which is when I walk into the party,</p>
<p>if you rewound it 10,000 times,</p>
<p>would I go and talk to that couple over there</p>
<p>versus that person?</p>
<p>Like, I might do this exact same thing every time</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve got some goal stack and I think,</p>
<p>okay, well, at this party,</p>
<p>I really want to meet these kind of people</p>
<p>or I feel awkward or whatever my goals are.</p>
<p>By the way, so there was something</p>
<p>that I meant to mention earlier.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t mind going back,</p>
<p>which is this, when we were talking about BCI.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if you know this,</p>
<p>but what I&rsquo;m spending 90% of my time doing now</p>
<p>is running a company.</p>
<p>Do you know about this?</p>
<p>Yes, I wasn&rsquo;t sure what the company is involved in.</p>
<p>Right, so. Can you talk about it?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So when it comes to the future of BCI,</p>
<p>you can put stuff into the brain invasively,</p>
<p>but my interest has been how you can get data streams</p>
<p>into the brain noninvasively.</p>
<p>So I run a company called Neosensory</p>
<p>and what we build is this little wristband.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve built this in many different form factors.</p>
<p>Oh, wow, that&rsquo;s it?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s got these vibratory motors in it.</p>
<p>So these things, as I&rsquo;m speaking, for example,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s capturing my voice and running algorithms</p>
<p>and then turning that into patterns of vibration here.</p>
<p>So people who are deaf, for example,</p>
<p>learn to hear through their skin.</p>
<p>So the information is getting up to their brain this way</p>
<p>and they learn how to hear.</p>
<p>So it turns out on day one, people are pretty good,</p>
<p>like better than you&rsquo;d expect at being able to say,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s weird, was that a dog barking?</p>
<p>Was that a baby crying?</p>
<p>Was that a door knock, a doorbell?</p>
<p>Like people are pretty good at it,</p>
<p>but with time they get better and better</p>
<p>and what it becomes is a new qualia.</p>
<p>In other words, a new subjective internal experience.</p>
<p>So on day one, they say, whoa, what was that?</p>
<p>Oh, oh, that was the dog barking.</p>
<p>But by three months later, they say,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s a dog barking somewhere.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s the dog.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And by the way, that&rsquo;s exactly how you learn</p>
<p>how to use your ears.</p>
<p>So of course you don&rsquo;t remember this,</p>
<p>but when you were an infant, all you have are</p>
<p>your eardrum vibrating causes spikes to go down,</p>
<p>your auditory nerves and impinging your auditory cortex.</p>
<p>Your brain doesn&rsquo;t know what those mean automatically,</p>
<p>but what happens is you learn how to hear</p>
<p>by looking for correlations.</p>
<p>You clap your hands as a baby,</p>
<p>you look at your mother&rsquo;s mouth moving</p>
<p>and that correlates with what&rsquo;s going on there.</p>
<p>And eventually your brain says, all right,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna summarize this as an internal experience,</p>
<p>as a conscious experience.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what happens here.</p>
<p>The weird part is that you can feed data into the brain,</p>
<p>not through the ears, but through any channel</p>
<p>that gets there.</p>
<p>As long as the information gets there,</p>
<p>your brain figures out what to do with it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Like expanding the set of sensors,</p>
<p>it could be arbitrarily, yeah,</p>
<p>it could expand arbitrarily, which is fascinating.</p>
<p>Well, exactly.</p>
<p>And by the way, the reason I use this skin,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all kinds of cool stuff going on</p>
<p>in the AR world with glasses.</p>
<p>But the fact is your eyes are overtaxed</p>
<p>and your ears are overtaxed</p>
<p>and you need to be able to see and hear other stuff.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re covered with the skin,</p>
<p>which is this incredible computational material</p>
<p>with which you can feed information.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t use our skin for much of anything nowadays.</p>
<p>My joke in the lab is that I say,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t call this the waste for nothing.</p>
<p>Because originally we built this as the vest</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re passing in all this information that way.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m doing here with the deaf community</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s called sensory substitution,</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m capturing sound and I&rsquo;m just replacing the ears</p>
<p>with the skin and that works.</p>
<p>One of the things I talk about LiveWire</p>
<p>is sensory expansion.</p>
<p>So what if you took something like your visual system,</p>
<p>which picks up on a very thin slice</p>
<p>of the electromagnetic spectrum,</p>
<p>and you could see infrared or ultraviolet.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve hooked that up, infrared and ultraviolet detectors,</p>
<p>and I can feel what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>So just as an example, the first night I built the infrared,</p>
<p>one of my engineers built it, the infrared detector,</p>
<p>I was walking in the dark between two houses</p>
<p>and suddenly I felt all this infrared radiation.</p>
<p>I was like, where&rsquo;s that come from?</p>
<p>And I just followed my wrist and I found an infrared camera,</p>
<p>a night vision camera that was,</p>
<p>but I immediately, oh, there&rsquo;s that thing there.</p>
<p>Of course, I would have never seen it,</p>
<p>but now it&rsquo;s just part of my reality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then of course,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m really interested in is sensory addition.</p>
<p>What if you could pick up on stuff</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t even part of what we normally pick up on,</p>
<p>like the magnetic field of the earth</p>
<p>or Twitter or stock market or things like that.</p>
<p>Or the, I don&rsquo;t know, some weird stuff</p>
<p>like the moods of other people or something like that.</p>
<p>Sure, now what you need is a way to measure this.</p>
<p>So as long as there&rsquo;s a machine that can measure it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy, it&rsquo;s trivial to feed this in here</p>
<p>and you come to be, it comes to be part of your reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you have another sensor.</p>
<p>And that kind of thing is without doing like,</p>
<p>if you look in Neuralink,</p>
<p>I forgot how you put it, but it was eloquent,</p>
<p>without getting, cutting into the brain, basically.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>So this costs, at the moment, $399.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not gonna kill you.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not gonna kill you.</p>
<p>You just put it on and when you&rsquo;re done, you take it off.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so, and the name of the company, by the way,</p>
<p>is Neosensory for new senses, because the whole idea is.</p>
<p>Beautiful, that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>You can, as I said, you come to the table</p>
<p>with certain plug and play devices and then that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Like I can pick up on this little bit</p>
<p>of the electromagnetic radiation,</p>
<p>you can pick up on this little frequency band</p>
<p>for hearing and so on, but I&rsquo;m stuck there</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no reason we have to be stuck there.</p>
<p>We can expand our umwelt by adding new senses, yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s umwelt?</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry, the umwelt is the slice of reality</p>
<p>that you pick up on.</p>
<p>So each animal has its own umwelt.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I forgot to define it before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such an important concept, which is to say,</p>
<p>for example, if you are a tick,</p>
<p>you pick up on butyric gas, you pick up on odor</p>
<p>and you pick up on temperature, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you construct your reality</p>
<p>is with those two sensors.</p>
<p>If you are a blind echolocating bat,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re picking up on air compression waves coming back,</p>
<p>you know, echolocation.</p>
<p>If you are the black ghost knife fish,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re picking up on changes in the electrical field</p>
<p>around you with electroreception.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how they swim around</p>
<p>and tell there&rsquo;s a rock there and so on.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s all they pick up on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s their umwelt.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the signals they get from the world</p>
<p>from which to construct their reality.</p>
<p>And they can be totally different umwelts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>And so our human umwelt is, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got little bits that we can pick up on.</p>
<p>One of the things I like to do with my students</p>
<p>is talk about, imagine that you are a bloodhound dog, right?</p>
<p>You are a bloodhound dog with a huge snout</p>
<p>with 200 million scent receptors in it.</p>
<p>And your whole world is about smelling.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;ve got slits in your nostrils,</p>
<p>like big nose fulls of air and so on.</p>
<p>Do you have a dog?</p>
<p>Nope, used to.</p>
<p>Used to, okay, right.</p>
<p>So you know, you walk your dog around</p>
<p>and your dog is smelling everything.</p>
<p>The whole world is full of signals</p>
<p>that you do not pick up on.</p>
<p>And so imagine if you were that dog</p>
<p>and you looked at your human master and thought,</p>
<p>my God, what is it like to have</p>
<p>the pitiful little nose of a human?</p>
<p>How could you not know that there&rsquo;s a cat 100 yards away</p>
<p>or that your friend was here six hours ago?</p>
<p>And so the idea is because we&rsquo;re stuck in our own belt,</p>
<p>because we have this little pitiful noses,</p>
<p>we think, okay, well, yeah, we&rsquo;re seeing reality,</p>
<p>but you can have very different sorts of realities</p>
<p>depending on the peripheral plug and play devices</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re equipped with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to think that like,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re being honest, probably our own belt</p>
<p>is, you know, some infinitely tiny percent</p>
<p>of the possibilities of how you can sense,</p>
<p>quote unquote, reality, even if you could,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a guy named Donald Hoffman, yeah,</p>
<p>who basically says we&rsquo;re really far away from reality</p>
<p>in terms of our ability to sense anything.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re very, we&rsquo;re almost like we&rsquo;re floating out there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s almost like completely attached</p>
<p>to the actual physical reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating that we can have extra senses</p>
<p>that could help us get a little bit closer.</p>
<p>Exactly, and by the way, this has been the fruits</p>
<p>of science is realizing, like, for example,</p>
<p>you know, you open your eyes</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s the world around you, right?</p>
<p>But of course, depending on how you calculate it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s less than a 10 trillionth of the electromagnetic</p>
<p>spectrum that we call visible light.</p>
<p>The reason I say it depends,</p>
<p>because, you know, it&rsquo;s actually infinite</p>
<p>in all directions presumably.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so that&rsquo;s exactly that.</p>
<p>And then science allows you to actually look</p>
<p>into the rest of it.</p>
<p>Exactly, so understanding how big the world is out there.</p>
<p>And the same with the world of really small</p>
<p>and the world of really large.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beyond our ability to sense.</p>
<p>Exactly, and so the reason I think this kind of thing</p>
<p>matters is because we now have an opportunity</p>
<p>for the first time in human history to say,</p>
<p>okay, well, I&rsquo;m just gonna include other things</p>
<p>in my own belt.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna include infrared radiation</p>
<p>and have a direct perceptual experience of that.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m very, you know, I mean,</p>
<p>so, you know, I&rsquo;ve given up my lab</p>
<p>and I run this company 90% of my time now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>I still teach at Stanford and I&rsquo;m, you know,</p>
<p>teaching courses and stuff like that.</p>
<p>But this is like, this is your passion.</p>
<p>The fire is on this.</p>
<p>Yeah, I feel like this is the most important thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening right now.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously I think that,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m devoting my time in my life to.</p>
<p>But I mean, it&rsquo;s a brilliant set of ideas.</p>
<p>It certainly is like, it&rsquo;s a step in a very vibrant future,</p>
<p>I would say.</p>
<p>Like the possibilities there are endless.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So if you ask what I think about Neuralink,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s amazing what those guys are doing</p>
<p>and working on,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s not practical for almost everybody.</p>
<p>For example, for people who are deaf, they buy this</p>
<p>and, you know, every day we&rsquo;re getting tons of emails</p>
<p>and tweets and whatever from people saying, wow,</p>
<p>I picked up on this and then I had no idea that was a,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even know that was happening out there.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re coming to hear, by the way,</p>
<p>this is, you know, less than a 10 year old,</p>
<p>by the way, this is less than a 10th of the price</p>
<p>of a hearing aid and like 250 times less</p>
<p>than a cochlear implant.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>People love hearing about what, you know,</p>
<p>brilliant folks like yourself could recommend</p>
<p>in terms of books.</p>
<p>Of course, you&rsquo;re an author of many books.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll, in the introduction,</p>
<p>mention all the books you&rsquo;ve written.</p>
<p>People should definitely read LiveWired.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to read some of it and it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>But is there three books, technical, fiction,</p>
<p>philosophical that had an impact on you</p>
<p>when you were younger or today and books,</p>
<p>perhaps some of which you would want to recommend</p>
<p>that others read?</p>
<p>You know, as an undergraduate,</p>
<p>I majored in British and American literature.</p>
<p>That was my major because I love literature.</p>
<p>I grew up with literature.</p>
<p>My father had these extensive bookshelves.</p>
<p>And so I grew up in the mountains in New Mexico.</p>
<p>And so that was mostly why I spent my time was reading books.</p>
<p>But, you know, I love, you know, Faulkner, Hemingway.</p>
<p>I love many South American authors,</p>
<p>Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Italo Calvino.</p>
<p>I would actually recommend Invisible Cities.</p>
<p>I just, I loved that book by Italo Calvino.</p>
<p>Sorry, it&rsquo;s a book of fiction.</p>
<p>Anthony Dorr wrote a book called</p>
<p>All the Light We Cannot See,</p>
<p>which actually was inspired by incognito,</p>
<p>by exactly what we were talking about earlier</p>
<p>about how you can only see a little bit of the,</p>
<p>what we call visible light in the electromagnetic radiation.</p>
<p>I wrote about this in incognito,</p>
<p>and then he reviewed incognito for the Washington Post.</p>
<p>Oh no, that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>And then he wrote this book called,</p>
<p>the book has nothing to do with that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s where the title comes from.</p>
<p>All the Light We Cannot See</p>
<p>is about the rest of the spectrum.</p>
<p>But the, that&rsquo;s an absolutely gorgeous book.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a book of fiction.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a book of fiction.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it about?</p>
<p>It takes place during World War II</p>
<p>about these two young people,</p>
<p>one of whom is blind and yeah.</p>
<p>Anything else?</p>
<p>So what, any, so you mentioned Hemingway?</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>Old Man and the Sea, what&rsquo;s your favorite?</p>
<p>Snow&rsquo;s a Kilimanjaro.</p>
<p>Oh wow, okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a collection of short stories that I love.</p>
<p>As far as nonfiction goes,</p>
<p>I grew up with Cosmos,</p>
<p>both watching the PBS series and then reading the book,</p>
<p>and that influenced me a huge amount in terms of what I do.</p>
<p>I, from the time I was a kid,</p>
<p>I felt like I want to be Carl Sagan.</p>
<p>Like, I just, that&rsquo;s what I loved.</p>
<p>And in the end, I just, you know,</p>
<p>I studied space physics for a while as an undergrad,</p>
<p>but then I, in my last semester,</p>
<p>discovered neuroscience last semester,</p>
<p>and I just thought, wow, I&rsquo;m hooked on that.</p>
<p>So the Carl Sagan of the brain.</p>
<p>That was my aspiration.</p>
<p>Is the aspiration.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re doing an incredible job of it.</p>
<p>So you open the book live wide with a quote by Heidegger.</p>
<p>Every man is born as many men and dies as a single one.</p>
<p>Well, what do you mean, or what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what I meant by it.</p>
<p>So he had his own reason why he was writing that,</p>
<p>but I meant this in terms of brain plasticity,</p>
<p>in terms of the library,</p>
<p>which is this issue that I mentioned before</p>
<p>about this, you know, this cone,</p>
<p>the space time cone that we are in,</p>
<p>which is that when you dropped into the world,</p>
<p>you, Lex, had all this different potential.</p>
<p>You could have been a great surfer</p>
<p>or a great chess player or a,</p>
<p>you could have been thousands of different men</p>
<p>when you grew up,</p>
<p>but what you did is things that were not your choice</p>
<p>and your choice along the way.</p>
<p>You know, you ended up navigating a particular path</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re exactly who you are.</p>
<p>You used to have lots of potential,</p>
<p>but the day you die, you will be exactly Lex.</p>
<p>You will be that one person, yeah.</p>
<p>So on that, in that context,</p>
<p>I mean, first of all, it&rsquo;s just a beautiful,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a humbling picture, but it&rsquo;s a beautiful one</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all the possible trajectories</p>
<p>and you pick one and you walk down that road</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the Robert Frost poem.</p>
<p>But on that topic, let me ask the biggest</p>
<p>and the most ridiculous question.</p>
<p>So in this live, wide brain,</p>
<p>when we choose all these different trajectories</p>
<p>and end up with one, what&rsquo;s the meaning of it all?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, is there a why here?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>David Engelman.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I mean, this is the question that everyone has attacked</p>
<p>from their own life or point of view,</p>
<p>by which I mean, culturally,</p>
<p>if you grew up in a religious society,</p>
<p>you have one way of attacking that question.</p>
<p>So if you grew up in a secular or scientific society,</p>
<p>you have a different way of attacking that question.</p>
<p>Obviously, I don&rsquo;t know, I abstain on that question.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I think one of the fundamental things,</p>
<p>I guess, in that, in all those possible trajectories</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re always asking.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the act of asking</p>
<p>what the heck is this thing for,</p>
<p>is equivalent to, or at least runs in parallel</p>
<p>to all the choices that you&rsquo;re making.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s kind of, that&rsquo;s the underlying question.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And by the way, you know,</p>
<p>this is the interesting thing about human psychology.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ve got all these layers of things</p>
<p>at which we can ask questions.</p>
<p>And so if you keep asking yourself the question about,</p>
<p>what is the optimal way for me to be spending my time?</p>
<p>What should I be doing?</p>
<p>What charity should I get involved with and so on?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re asking those big questions</p>
<p>that steers you appropriately,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re the type of person who never asks,</p>
<p>hey, is there something better I can be doing with my time,</p>
<p>then presumably you won&rsquo;t optimize</p>
<p>whatever it is that is important to you.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve, I think just in your eyes, in your work,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a passion that just is obvious and it&rsquo;s inspiring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s contagious.</p>
<p>What, if you were to give advice to us,</p>
<p>a young person today,</p>
<p>in the crazy chaos that we live today about life,</p>
<p>about how to discover their passion,</p>
<p>is there some words that you could give?</p>
<p>First of all, I would say the main thing</p>
<p>for a young person is stay adaptable.</p>
<p>And this is back to this issue of why COVID</p>
<p>is useful for us because it forces us off our tracks.</p>
<p>The fact is the jobs that will exist 20 years from now,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t even have names for it.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t even imagine the jobs that are gonna exist.</p>
<p>And so when young people that I know go into college</p>
<p>and they say, hey, what should I major in and so on,</p>
<p>college is and should be less and less vocational,</p>
<p>as in, oh, I&rsquo;m gonna learn how to do this</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m gonna do that the rest of my career.</p>
<p>The world just isn&rsquo;t that way anymore</p>
<p>with the exponential speed of things.</p>
<p>So the important thing is learning how to learn,</p>
<p>learning how to be livewired and adaptable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really key.</p>
<p>And what I advise young people when I talk to them is,</p>
<p>what you digest, that&rsquo;s what gives you the raw storehouse</p>
<p>of things that you can remix and be creative with.</p>
<p>And so eat broadly and widely.</p>
<p>And obviously this is the wonderful thing</p>
<p>about the internet world we live in now</p>
<p>is you kind of can&rsquo;t help it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re constantly, whoa.</p>
<p>You go down some mole hole of Wikipedia</p>
<p>and you think, oh, I didn&rsquo;t even realize that was a thing.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that existed.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>Embrace that.</p>
<p>Embrace that, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And what I tell people is just always do a gut check</p>
<p>about, okay, I&rsquo;m reading this paper</p>
<p>and yeah, I think that, but this paper, wow,</p>
<p>that really, I really cared about that in some way.</p>
<p>I tell them just to keep a real sniff out for that.</p>
<p>And when you find those things, keep going down those paths.</p>
<p>Yeah, don&rsquo;t be afraid.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s one of the challenges and the downsides</p>
<p>of having so many beautiful options</p>
<p>is that sometimes people are a little bit afraid</p>
<p>to really commit, but that&rsquo;s very true.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s something that just sparks your interest</p>
<p>and passion, just run with it.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s, it goes back to the Haider quote.</p>
<p>I mean, we only get this one life</p>
<p>and that trajectory, it doesn&rsquo;t last forever.</p>
<p>So just if something sparks your imagination,</p>
<p>your passion is run with it.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a more beautiful way to end it.</p>
<p>David, it&rsquo;s a huge honor to finally meet you.</p>
<p>Your work is inspiring so many people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to so many people who are passionate</p>
<p>about neuroscience, about the brain, even outside</p>
<p>that read your book.</p>
<p>So I hope you keep doing so.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re already there with Carl Sagan.</p>
<p>I hope you continue growing.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was an honor talking with you today.</p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>
<p>Great, you too, Lex, wonderful.</p>

<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from David Eagleman in his book,</p>
<p>Some Forty Tales from the Afterlives.</p>
<p>Imagine for a moment there were nothing but</p>
<p>the product of billions of years of molecules</p>
<p>coming together and ratcheting up through natural selection.</p>
<p>There were composed only of highways of fluids</p>
<p>and chemicals sliding along roadways</p>
<p>within billions of dancing cells.</p>
<p>The trillions of synaptic connections hum in parallel</p>
<p>that this vast egg like fabric of micro thin circuitry</p>
<p>runs algorithms undreamt of in modern science,</p>
<p>and that these neural programs give rise to</p>
<p>our decision making, loves, desires, fears, and aspirations.</p>
<p>To me, understanding this would be a numinous experience,</p>
<p>better than anything ever proposed in any holy text.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
