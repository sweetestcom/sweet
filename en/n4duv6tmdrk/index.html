<p>um from my mother&rsquo;s side of the family</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been especially interested in</p>
<p>the supplement of choline</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ve just recently started that I</p>
<p>have been doing some fasting</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and watching</p>
<p>sugars and such uh keto uh</p>
<p>slanted and</p>
<p>my question is because I&rsquo;m basically</p>
<p>eating one meal a day and have been the</p>
<p>last few months</p>
<p>um the good news is I just had one of</p>
<p>those fiber scans</p>
<p>and last year I was on the first step of</p>
<p>Nash now I&rsquo;m back in what they call the</p>
<p>green</p>
<p>and so if I&rsquo;m doing something right but</p>
<p>my liver is still very fatty that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>S2 grade</p>
<p>but my question is</p>
<p>with choline</p>
<p>from what I understand it drains</p>
<p>basically it starts to drain the fat</p>
<p>from the liver I believe is what you had</p>
<p>said</p>
<p>uh in some sort of fashion and I believe</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>it needs to be taken with meals in fact</p>
<p>from what I understand</p>
<p>and my question is is there any conflict</p>
<p>or interference with the absorption and</p>
<p>processing of fat soluble vitamins</p>
<p>or other supplements and things that</p>
<p>need the fat from immuno or</p>
<p>um in order to because there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>supplements where it&rsquo;s best to take on</p>
<p>an empty stomach and there&rsquo;s some that</p>
<p>are best you know vitamin D levels the</p>
<p>vitamin E I just started your tacotranos</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s how you pronounce it uh</p>
<p>so I want to find out if there was any</p>
<p>problem with choline in this I&rsquo;m trying</p>
<p>to get it all in one meal as far as all</p>
<p>of the</p>
<p>supplements that need a meal to if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s any conflict there</p>
<p>good question questions which I</p>
<p>appreciate</p>
<p>um so a couple things about choline</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>when you talk about hereditary problems</p>
<p>with the fatty liver</p>
<p>um you know I don&rsquo;t know if you had a</p>
<p>DNA testing or not but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely several problems</p>
<p>um that could be related to the</p>
<p>metabolism of that and the accumulation</p>
<p>of fat in the liver so um let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>assume that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what you have</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re on the right track because</p>
<p>choline is one of the key things because</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re deficient in choline you</p>
<p>develop a fatty liver</p>
<p>um so the fact you&rsquo;re taking choline</p>
<p>whether you take it with the meal it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more of a minor point</p>
<p>you might want to just take all your</p>
<p>vitamins with a meal because that way</p>
<p>you could actually have a little bit</p>
<p>better absorption</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s what I would recommend</p>
<p>um in addition to choline just two other</p>
<p>things</p>
<p>actually three other things that you</p>
<p>should also</p>
<p>do one would make sure that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>consuming some type of</p>
<p>probiotic food like sauerkraut something</p>
<p>like that because your microbes make</p>
<p>bile salts too and that can actually</p>
<p>help</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>break down see see all this cholesterol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going through your liver um</p>
<p>the primary mode of elimination for it</p>
<p>is the bile bile ducts in the bile salts</p>
<p>so if you have enough of those you&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>good impact the fact that you have a</p>
<p>fatty liver we have less liver to make</p>
<p>bile</p>
<p>and so uh that bile is um very very</p>
<p>important just as important as choline</p>
<p>to eliminate</p>
<p>uh fat as well as</p>
<p>cholesterol from the body so I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the right track though because</p>
<p>things are improving by going on keto</p>
<p>strict keeping your carbs low that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to ultimately help you the most so</p>
<p>we have um</p>
<p>good Probiotic foods we have choline we</p>
<p>also have some bile salt supplement that</p>
<p>you can take maybe the gallbladder</p>
<p>formula right after a meal that will</p>
<p>give you some more help</p>
<p>um the fact that you&rsquo;re doing one meal a</p>
<p>day that means you&rsquo;re fasting for a good</p>
<p>amount of time which is going to greatly</p>
<p>over time get rid of the fat from the</p>
<p>liver</p>
<p>one more thing</p>
<p>if there is some genetic issue there is</p>
<p>another</p>
<p>Gene problem that&rsquo;s related to folic</p>
<p>acid</p>
<p>um so converting the folic acid to</p>
<p>folate the ACTA Coram folic acid which</p>
<p>which does have a lot to do with um a</p>
<p>lot of things in one thing that they</p>
<p>found a higher incidence of people with</p>
<p>fatty liver with um a problem with the</p>
<p>genetic folate issue</p>
<p>so what does that have to do with</p>
<p>anything well</p>
<p>um you may want to consider also getting</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>uh methylfolate which is a type of uh</p>
<p>folate that your body can really use</p>
<p>in helping eliminate some of this</p>
<p>cholesterol too it also help your liver</p>
<p>detox will help make neurotransmitters</p>
<p>it can help with a lot of things</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I would recommend uh for the</p>
<p>meantime and I think you&rsquo;re on the right</p>
<p>track we just have to give it more time</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re going to find that you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>your liver will will come back in a good</p>
<p>shape probably in some months from now</p>
<p>but it does take a good amount of time</p>
<p>and also realize that</p>
<p>if there has been a chronic liver</p>
<p>problem in the past it could take up to</p>
<p>two to three years to fully establish</p>
<p>um that how that fully functioning liver</p>
<p>um you know with all the staying</p>
<p>consistent doing all the right things</p>
<p>but stay tuned for more information on</p>
<p>the liver because I&rsquo;m gonna I will have</p>
<p>several videos lined up this next week</p>
<p>on this one topic my goodness Casey you</p>
<p>got a full diagnosis uh from the doctor</p>
<p>but no cures that&rsquo;s not allowed in</p>
<p>various States uh so we&rsquo;re glad that you</p>
<p>came on and we&rsquo;d really love to hear uh</p>
<p>your progress as it goes on so please</p>
<p>feel free to kind of contact us back and</p>
<p>in the meantime okay you stay online</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to be privy to all</p>
<p>the questions and fun things that happen</p>
<p>on the show speaking of which Dr Berg</p>
<p>this is our first question for today</p>
<p>okay so what is the one food out of all</p>
<p>the foods</p>
<p>that virtually gets rid of</p>
<p>all menopausal symptoms</p>
<p>all right listen up ladies and the</p>
<p>Fellas if you know uh chime in for</p>
<p>goodness sakes uh let&rsquo;s see so why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we go to social media let&rsquo;s start off by</p>
<p>uh talking about where people are</p>
<p>enjoying the show from so we&rsquo;d like to</p>
<p>say good morning to all our viewers if</p>
<p>you are excuses joining from the UK</p>
<p>Canada Mexico Greenland Portugal India</p>

<p>Belgium Malaysia good grief Uganda</p>
<p>Denmark Nepal the Netherlands Kuwait</p>
<p>Brazil Bangladesh I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard from them before Jordan Finland</p>
<p>Nigeria Estonia Sri Lanka Georgia not</p>
<p>that one era tree if I&rsquo;m saying that</p>
<p>right Singapore Kurdistan Croatia</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea Jamaica haven&rsquo;t heard</p>
<p>from them for a while uh Slovenia</p>
<p>Slovakia</p>
<p>um my eyes are failing me Bhutan Zambia</p>
<p>and all across these United States and</p>
<p>as usual someone else is likely to say</p>
<p>hey what about us and we&rsquo;ll mention your</p>
<p>country as well if that pops up in the</p>
<p>interim now speaking of everybody</p>
<p>listening let&rsquo;s go to social media media</p>
<p>excuse me Lucas from Facebook should</p>
<p>someone with nocturia avoid Dairy and</p>
<p>protein altogether did I say that right</p>
<p>nocturia</p>
<p>nocturia</p>
<p>um you know I I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t I couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give you a good um answer because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not sure I&rsquo;m not sure so um</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>all right well let&rsquo;s go back to a uh a</p>
<p>popular subject today Heidi from</p>
<p>Facebook what is your take on vitamin E</p>
<p>for a fatty liver and cirrhosis she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gone the whole uh the whole Gauntlet</p>
<p>with her liver there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>good data to show that um vitamin D in</p>
<p>the form especially in the form of</p>
<p>tocatrinals which is kind of a newly</p>
<p>discovered uh form of vitamin E it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been around forever but it&rsquo;s just been</p>
<p>discovered somewhat recently uh in the</p>
<p>relationship between reducing Australia</p>
<p>liver disease and cirrhosis</p>
<p>um I may even I don&rsquo;t have it right</p>
<p>behind me but I have a whole textbook on</p>
<p>tour katrinos and there&rsquo;s a lot of data</p>
<p>on what it can do for a fibrotic liver</p>
<p>as well as a fatty liver</p>
<p>um as well as an inflamed liver because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the most potent antioxidants</p>
<p>and the tocatrinos work like 50 times or</p>
<p>a lot faster as far as what they do with</p>
<p>mopping up free radical damage and so</p>
<p>any type of scarring anywhere in the</p>
<p>body tocatrinos is a really good thing</p>
<p>so highly recommend it but when you take</p>
<p>tocatrinals it&rsquo;s very important not also</p>
<p>at the same time take to cofferals</p>
<p>because they compete so you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>dilute the effect so when you get Toca</p>
<p>pools get a mixed blend of all the like</p>
<p>the alpha beta Delta gamma but not the</p>
<p>cough for Rose</p>
<p>interesting okay now speaking of that Dr</p>
<p>Berg you have a great app would they be</p>
<p>able to do some research on that I know</p>
<p>you can find videos and audio things but</p>
<p>what about other answers to such</p>
<p>questions is that a good resource it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a it&rsquo;s like a it&rsquo;s a better</p>
<p>um search engine than YouTube if you</p>
<p>want to find my videos on certain topics</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um yeah so definitely it&rsquo;s a free app</p>
<p>you can check it out and give me some</p>
<p>feedback let me know how you like it or</p>
<p>if you hate it tell me why and we will</p>
<p>work on improving it wonderful let them</p>
<p>have it Dr Berg can take it he&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>very thick skin</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see jet from YouTube recently I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been very itchy on my facial area and I</p>
<p>am looking at vitamin deficiency of some</p>
<p>kind any any words on itchiness of the</p>
<p>face</p>
<p>pureitis so it&rsquo;s uh that&rsquo;s the medical</p>
<p>term for itchiness but um you know it</p>
<p>could be a couple different things I</p>
<p>would need more information but if you</p>
<p>have a a problem with uh bile bile ducts</p>
<p>backing up into the</p>
<p>um blood and in the skin that can cause</p>
<p>itchy so you might just need something</p>
<p>called Tut cut to get rid of that</p>
<p>problem and that usually will help you</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m assuming that you&rsquo;re on a</p>
<p>healthy keto doing intermittent fasting</p>
<p>too there&rsquo;s also other types of itching</p>
<p>too with some type of uh</p>
<p>imbalance in microbial</p>
<p>um life on your skin</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know what how how that comes</p>
<p>about is if you overly cleanse or</p>
<p>sterilize your skin it&rsquo;s all sorts of</p>
<p>detergents and soaps and um other things</p>
<p>that destroy the microbiome of your skin</p>
<p>which is uh so you just got to be</p>
<p>careful about over cleaning your skin</p>
<p>you know like be very gentle don&rsquo;t pull</p>
<p>a lot of</p>
<p>stuff on it because it just throws off</p>
<p>the microbiome and then you end up with</p>
<p>rashes or itchiness or all sorts of skin</p>
<p>issues all right very good let&rsquo;s go back</p>
<p>to our green room and Yuan uh</p>
<p>disconnected for a while and now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>back so we&rsquo;re so glad that we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be able to hear from her Yuan you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on with Dr bird</p>
<p>hi Dr Berg my name is Johan I&rsquo;m come to</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>undiagnosed abdominal pain and the Dinos</p>
<p>was a functional dyspepsia</p>
<p>um I hardly can&rsquo;t eat anything lost tons</p>
<p>of weight</p>
<p>and uh and burping</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>constantly</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so I think everybody should try to lose</p>
<p>weight and I&rsquo;m trying to gain weight and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s uh with current the the</p>
<p>condition was triggered by a series of</p>
<p>uh very stressful events</p>
<p>um and it&rsquo;s been three months now I</p>
<p>think I&rsquo;m on the road of uh slowly dying</p>
<p>out I was given anti-accid and the</p>
<p>sleeping pills</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think none of those are helping</p>
<p>me right now</p>
<p>um could you please I have a daughter I</p>
<p>have a mom to take care of</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>a couple things that are really really</p>
<p>really really really really important</p>
<p>especially if you if you took an antacid</p>
<p>when you disrupt that acid boy oh my</p>
<p>goodness everything starts going</p>
<p>downhill</p>
<p>um so it sounds to me like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>inflammation there&rsquo;s a lot of digestive</p>
<p>issues I think a couple things that are</p>
<p>really really going to help you is to go</p>
<p>find somewhere order online whatever a</p>
<p>product called Tut cup</p>
<p>tadka and I know you&rsquo;re going to say</p>
<p>well how do I spell tadka</p>
<p>um t-u-d-c-a it&rsquo;s the type of bile salt</p>
<p>that I think would um</p>
<p>would help uh your liver</p>
<p>um help the symptoms that you have that</p>
<p>sound to be related to backup of the</p>
<p>liver or digestive issues or burping</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;ll help all those symptoms too</p>
<p>that kind of just increases the flow so</p>
<p>you can actually start to digest better</p>
<p>um if possible I would start taking</p>
<p>betaine hydrochloride just one with the</p>
<p>meal and slowly increase it because we</p>
<p>want to reestablish the pH of the</p>
<p>stomach so you can start breaking down</p>
<p>proteins so you can start to have a</p>
<p>barrier in your stomach to kill microbes</p>
<p>because if you don&rsquo;t have the right pH</p>
<p>all sorts of things can invade and</p>
<p>create infection and stress by the way</p>
<p>paralyzes the immune system and it</p>
<p>throws off all the things that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking about</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>so basically cut cup</p>
<p>butane hydrochloride</p>
<p>and the third thing is a natural vitamin</p>
<p>B1</p>
<p>because B1 is the one that supports</p>
<p>something called the parasympathetic</p>
<p>nervous system which is behind stress</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also behind feeding that vagus</p>
<p>nerve that</p>
<p>um something called acetylcholine to</p>
<p>help it work especially in the not just</p>
<p>your stomach but the small intestine</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the Vex nerve is um primarily a hundred</p>
<p>percent</p>
<p>parasympathetic which means that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>opposite of the flight or fight</p>
<p>mechanism so it&rsquo;s all about</p>
<p>um rest and Digest</p>
<p>and so the you need to that you won</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll help you stress as well the uh the</p>
<p>other things to increase the acidity and</p>
<p>then something to help the gallbladder</p>
<p>and then the last thing</p>
<p>um to eat I would recommend eating</p>
<p>things that are more with probiotics</p>
<p>naturally like whether it&rsquo;s kimchi</p>
<p>sauerkraut you should have that with</p>
<p>every single meal just a little bit and</p>
<p>start reestablishing your microbes in</p>
<p>your gut</p>
<p>um and then do whatever you can to</p>
<p>resolve that stress but those are some</p>
<p>some really important things I would</p>
<p>jump on right away and then of course</p>
<p>watch more of my videos for uh the basic</p>
<p>diet that I recommend and I think you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be able to digest more over time once</p>
<p>you fix the stomach all right you want</p>
<p>thank you so much for that and we</p>
<p>appreciate your calling let me just get</p>
<p>let me just get that last question okay</p>
<p>let me bring her back out go ahead you</p>
<p>want sorry for stepping on you thank you</p>
<p>yeah I really appreciate it</p>
<p>um so the HCC I already bought the the</p>
<p>brand that are you selling on them at</p>
<p>least branded by your name those are</p>
<p>sufficient can I take an antioxidant</p>
<p>with it or you suggest I Temper Temper</p>
<p>of the anti-asset over time well Utah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about my the betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride in the digest formula yes</p>
<p>and also the other is biosot</p>
<p>okay take the bile salt the gallbladder</p>
<p>right after the meal not before</p>
<p>and then the digest should take before</p>
<p>the problem and I&rsquo;m not I can&rsquo;t legally</p>
<p>tell you not to take your antacid but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to tell you if you take</p>
<p>them together you neutralize the effect</p>
<p>because that pH in your stomach normally</p>
<p>should be between one and three</p>
<p>extremely acid so the more you take the</p>
<p>acid away</p>
<p>the more that you have a problem because</p>
<p>now we can&rsquo;t kill off microbes we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>digest protein we can&rsquo;t absorb minerals</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t trigger the gallbladder to work</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t trigger the pancreas to release</p>
<p>enzymes so it&rsquo;s kind of like I know the</p>
<p>antiacid is trying to solve one problem</p>
<p>at the expense of a lot of other</p>
<p>problems so so it&rsquo;s kind of like if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to you&rsquo;re in battle in a</p>
<p>war</p>
<p>and um some enemy came in and you shoot</p>
<p>a grenade and end up</p>
<p>killing everyone oh you you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really solve the problem so</p>
<p>um I just would look at that and see if</p>
<p>I get get with your doctor to kind of</p>
<p>work out a maybe a better strategy than</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>thank you the doctors are I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how to say the the only thing that gave</p>
<p>is anti-asset when no matter what you</p>
<p>have find a new doctor find someone that</p>
<p>is more alternative</p>
<p>um because there&rsquo;s plenty of doctors out</p>
<p>there you got to find someone</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s doctors out there that even</p>
<p>wrote write books on you know um</p>
<p>using acidifiers to fix</p>
<p>these problems so you just have to get</p>
<p>the right doctor you know it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>doctor is someone that&rsquo;s working for you</p>
<p>so you have your choice and you just</p>
<p>have to find someone that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>knowledgeable about looking outside the</p>
<p>box unfortunately</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s hard to find a good doctor that</p>
<p>can think outside the box and really uh</p>
<p>help get to the root of the problem</p>
<p>versus just suppress the symptom and</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s another Med to treat your symptom</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not looking long term and of</p>
<p>course</p>
<p>you know I would love to just</p>
<p>be a fly on the wall and just and or</p>
<p>even just ask your doctor like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the purpose of hydrochloric acid don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we need that if we get rid of that</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen to um the</p>
<p>digestion of protein and what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>long-term effects and what if I develop</p>
<p>a chlorohydria or hypochlorohydria which</p>
<p>is a common problem what then what what</p>
<p>do I do you know these are all questions</p>
<p>that I would ask the doctor</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>well thank you so much Yuan and please</p>
<p>get back with us and let us know if you</p>
<p>ever found the doctor that will actually</p>
<p>work with you and work on your problem</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d love to hear back from you let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>to our questions uh Doc and we have an</p>
<p>answer for the first one uh let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>boy Carrie is working so fast that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got a million questions after that let</p>
<p>me scroll back up</p>
<p>all right 50 uh the question asks what</p>
<p>is one food that fixes virtually all</p>
<p>menopausal symptoms uh 65 of our</p>
<p>respondents say cruciferous vegetables</p>
<p>20 say garlic 10 say milk thistle and</p>
<p>five percent say apple cider vinegar any</p>
<p>winners</p>
<p>boy if you have menopausal symptoms like</p>
<p>the hot flashes the night sweats the low</p>
<p>libido the vaginal dryness the um</p>
<p>depression or bone loss this information</p>
<p>is going to be very valuable because if</p>
<p>you take a look at what happens during</p>
<p>menopause you um you have a loss of the</p>
<p>ovaries right and then if you go to the</p>
<p>doctors they&rsquo;ll say well you&rsquo;re losing</p>
<p>the estrogen and progesterone let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>give you HRT you know or that&rsquo;s just you</p>
<p>have to live with it or there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>we can do because this happens as a</p>
<p>normal thing it&rsquo;s absolutely positively</p>
<p>not normal at all if you look at what</p>
<p>happens to menopause you have a backup</p>
<p>of your adrenals that kick in the</p>
<p>adrenals make every single hormone that</p>
<p>the ovary makes and if you look at the</p>
<p>um what we&rsquo;re dealing with we&rsquo;re dealing</p>
<p>with a collection of all these steroid</p>
<p>hormones which are sex hormones right</p>
<p>and all the different Pathways all of</p>
<p>them all of them originate from one</p>
<p>thing and that thing is cholesterol</p>
<p>eighty percent of the cholesterol that</p>
<p>feeds the liver is in the form of LDL</p>
<p>the thing that you&rsquo;re so people are so</p>
<p>many people are afraid of and uh and you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get this cholesterol from plants</p>
<p>or avocado oil or even olive oil or even</p>
<p>coconut oil it&rsquo;s only in animal products</p>
<p>so if you were to start adding more</p>
<p>grass-fed butter to your diet or egg</p>
<p>yolks or shrimp and seafood and or organ</p>
<p>meats or things with cholesterol that</p>
<p>would probably be the smartest thing you</p>
<p>could do to start feeding these hormones</p>
<p>and just watch what happens to the</p>
<p>menopausal symptoms you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>notice like a significant Improvement</p>
<p>fairly quick because now you&rsquo;re finally</p>
<p>no longer starving these hormones what</p>
<p>they need if you feed them you&rsquo;ll build</p>
<p>up the pathways through these hormones</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s probably the the simplest thing</p>
<p>that someone can do but unfortunately</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s trying to do the opposite</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to get their</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re precursors from plants plants</p>
<p>have their place but not when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>building steroids and you can&rsquo;t get the</p>
<p>this precursor from eating seeds or nuts</p>
<p>or grains or</p>
<p>salad or any of that it has to come from</p>
<p>the animal products so another reason</p>
<p>why you should start eating the fatty</p>
<p>cheese</p>
<p>Wonderful by the way our our producer</p>
<p>Terry is ever The Advocate and Watchdog</p>
<p>for the audience and he mentioned that I</p>
<p>uh failed to say 15 percent of the</p>
<p>audience said omega-3 fatty acids for</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that worth does that make it more</p>
<p>correct are they does that have</p>
<p>something to do perhaps with building</p>
<p>yeah yeah it does yeah all right good so</p>
<p>sorry audience 15 of you are brilliant</p>
<p>and I left your uh left your answer out</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t ever do that again in the next</p>
<p>five minutes</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s move on why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we go to the next question get</p>
<p>that out there and this is a true falser</p>
<p>okay true or false consuming</p>
<p>phytoestrogens</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>um Can worsen the effects of estrogen</p>
<p>dominance</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re estrogen dominant would</p>
<p>adding more phytoestrogens in the plants</p>
<p>would that worsen things</p>
<p>all right very good climb on that let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go to Facebook Bernadette from Facebook</p>
<p>should type one uh diabetic eat carrots</p>
<p>is the whole of her question</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you can you can because the amount of</p>
<p>fiber the so I mean that&rsquo;s so much fiber</p>
<p>not carrot juice but actual fiber will</p>
<p>buffer the insulin response of the</p>
<p>carrot juice</p>
<p>um if you look at the glycemic index</p>
<p>that will say one thing but if you look</p>
<p>at the What&rsquo;s called the glycemic load</p>
<p>which is something completely different</p>
<p>look that up I&rsquo;ve done a video on it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s basically that&rsquo;s that basically</p>
<p>talks about the amount of carbohydrate</p>
<p>versus the fiber because we can actually</p>
<p>deduct the fiber from the total</p>
<p>carbohydrates and that gives us our net</p>
<p>carbs</p>
<p>so because carrots are so fibrous</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re pretty good for a</p>
<p>diabetic I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have any problem at all I think you</p>
<p>would have a problem with your carrot</p>
<p>juice but carrots um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna have a problem at all</p>
<p>good that&rsquo;s wonderful Roseanne from</p>
<p>Facebook speaking of Ted cut because of</p>
<p>watching your videos I&rsquo;ve started taking</p>
<p>Tucka what is your recommended daily</p>
<p>dose if you didn&rsquo;t already give that</p>
<p>today doc it depends on the problem if</p>
<p>you have a very severe problem you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to deal with I would take two in</p>
<p>the morning and two in the afternoon on</p>
<p>an empty stomach if you have a a mild</p>
<p>issue maybe just take one and one if you</p>
<p>have a</p>
<p>you know maintenance issue just take one</p>
<p>a day</p>
<p>um so it really depends on what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to do are you trying to dissolve</p>
<p>a gallstone well then take more if you</p>
<p>have severe backup in your bile ducts</p>
<p>take more</p>
<p>all right very good believe it or not we</p>
<p>have an answer Lightning Fast answer</p>
<p>back from the audience on our second</p>
<p>question a true falsa which asks</p>
<p>consuming uh</p>
<p>phytoestrogen can worsen the effects of</p>
<p>estrogen dominance and we have a quorum</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s what you call it 99</p>
<p>uh say uh sorry folks I keep losing the</p>
<p>questions are coming in so fast 99 of</p>
<p>respondents say it&rsquo;s true and one</p>
<p>percent&rsquo;s holding out says it&rsquo;s false</p>
<p>the answer is false oh my God it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>true so when you take the phytonutrient</p>
<p>phytoestrogens right you think wow my</p>
<p>gosh I&rsquo;m going to have a I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>have worse situation with estrogen</p>
<p>dominance</p>
<p>um what happens the the plant estrogens</p>
<p>compete</p>
<p>for the stronger estrogens that are</p>
<p>creating a problem and so they&rsquo;re more</p>
<p>protective they help balance the</p>
<p>estrogen ratios because you have three</p>
<p>different estrogens and it puts you in a</p>
<p>better place estrogen wise in a more</p>
<p>protective against cancer place and so</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s not going to make things worse</p>
<p>at all and this is why</p>
<p>um if someone does have estrogen</p>
<p>dominance we recommend</p>
<p>things like cruciferous vegetables and a</p>
<p>lot of the properties are uh they have</p>
<p>phytoestrogens</p>
<p>and this is also why I would recommend</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>um like flaxseed oil and uh just so</p>
<p>happens that these phytoestrogens are</p>
<p>basically</p>
<p>anti-carcinogenic I mean like people are</p>
<p>concerned oh my gosh I&rsquo;m not am I going</p>
<p>to get cancer well that&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>protective against cancer so because it</p>
<p>has a word in there that says estrogen</p>
<p>you know you have to just understand the</p>
<p>mechanisms of what really happens but um</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s not going to worsen things so</p>
<p>that was uh the true answer would be</p>
<p>false oh audience not even Terry can</p>
<p>save you for this however there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>percent of the odds that&rsquo;s strutting</p>
<p>around the office or living room right</p>
<p>now and congratulations for you holding</p>
<p>out for the correct answer all right</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go back to social media</p>
<p>uh and Robert and this is from YouTube I</p>
<p>take your nutritional yeast and it seems</p>
<p>to make a difference in how I feel but</p>
<p>it also gives me insomnia now I never</p>
<p>got insomnia before what&rsquo;s going on with</p>
<p>uh with Robert</p>
<p>well um I would recommend taking it in</p>
<p>the morning okay if it gives you</p>
<p>insomnia I have no idea why you would</p>
<p>have insomnia um maybe it has to do</p>
<p>something with giving more energy but</p>
<p>the yeah it&rsquo;s kind of like this uh I</p>
<p>have I have found that for the majority</p>
<p>of the population when they take even B</p>
<p>vitamins before bed especially B1 they</p>
<p>sleep better but do you always have the</p>
<p>exception you have someone that has the</p>
<p>opposite response the same thing with</p>
<p>vitamin D I mean for some people it just</p>
<p>puts them right out other people wakes</p>
<p>them up so I would just take maybe a</p>
<p>little bit less and take it in the</p>
<p>morning and see if that is a problem or</p>
<p>not all right very good good luck with</p>
<p>that I hate not being able to sleep but</p>
<p>never happened to me from nutritional</p>
<p>yeast but we&rsquo;re all a little different</p>
<p>back to Facebook llama wants to know the</p>
<p>best way to address an iron deficiency</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing llama is a female</p>
<p>yeah I would not try to get your iron</p>
<p>from um like spinach or</p>
<p>that that gives you the type of iron</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called non-heem which is</p>
<p>um not the right iron that you need so</p>
<p>you want to get your iron from red meat</p>
<p>grass-fed uh liver organ Meats</p>
<p>um and if you&rsquo;re going to get in the</p>
<p>supplement I would get it from maybe a</p>
<p>spleen extract or a liver pills but that</p>
<p>would be the best source of iron you</p>
<p>know recently I just started to consume</p>
<p>something I&rsquo;ve never consumed before</p>
<p>which is like um Venice deer meat</p>
<p>um and I was like very surprised</p>
<p>how good it was and how rich and how red</p>
<p>it was because the amount of I mean talk</p>
<p>about an iron supplement on steroids</p>
<p>that would be a good source of um Iron</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>yeah the red meat red is iron so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what you want to do like the exact food</p>
<p>that people are trying to tell you</p>
<p>probably not meat</p>
<p>of course we that always seems to be the</p>
<p>case like just find out what everyone</p>
<p>was doing and doing the and go in the</p>
<p>opposite direction you&rsquo;ll probably be</p>
<p>extremely healthy</p>
<p>all right llama go out and get your bow</p>
<p>and arrow and let&rsquo;s get some venison on</p>
<p>the table and help you with your issue</p>
<p>there uh and let&rsquo;s see uh</p>
<p>uh this is Holly back to Facebook got a</p>
<p>lot of facebookers today what&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>way to help someone suffering with</p>
<p>angina</p>
<p>well that would be the tocotrino</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know that the tocatrinos the vitamin</p>
<p>E increases the oxygen carrying capacity</p>
<p>by 250 percent in certain studies which</p>
<p>will actually it&rsquo;s kind of works as like</p>
<p>a natural version of nitro</p>
<p>uh glycerin so it tends to open up the</p>
<p>heart but of course you know you got to</p>
<p>find out the root reason why you have on</p>
<p>John in the first place is it a clogged</p>
<p>artery I have a lot of videos on what to</p>
<p>do for the heart</p>
<p>um but again this is the tip of the</p>
<p>iceberg this is not going to solve your</p>
<p>problem it might help your symptom but</p>
<p>we really need to</p>
<p>um change the basic core eating uh</p>
<p>I would follow my recommendations with</p>
<p>eating wide you know eating wise and I</p>
<p>would also um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>do a calcium test a coronary artery</p>
<p>calcification test CAC test to see if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a calcium blockage if there is</p>
<p>then watch my videos and what to do but</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a few reasons why you might</p>
<p>have angina and it could be that your</p>
<p>arteries are not a problem you just have</p>
<p>this uh this heart muscle problem</p>
<p>um and again you know it&rsquo;s like I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have enough data to tell you</p>
<p>anything more than that so but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s definitely a reason for this</p>
<p>angina</p>
<p>um I will say one last thing</p>
<p>um I had a lady come in to the the</p>
<p>clinic and she had a</p>
<p>spent forty thousand dollars out of</p>
<p>power to try to figure out her angina</p>
<p>pain and she&rsquo;s been in the hospital they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t every these all these different</p>
<p>tests they can&rsquo;t find anything wrong</p>
<p>with her heart and I said when when did</p>
<p>it start she said</p>
<p>um I think it was last Monday I said</p>
<p>what time she said five o&rsquo;clock I said</p>
<p>what did you eat just before that she</p>
<p>said oh a banana split</p>
<p>I said lay on the table I started</p>
<p>working on doing some massage around her</p>
<p>bile ducts and gallbladder area</p>
<p>and she just felt so good after that</p>
<p>um and I can feel it&rsquo;s all congested you</p>
<p>know because she normally doesn&rsquo;t need a</p>
<p>banana split apparently somehow it</p>
<p>clogged up her uh</p>
<p>her bile ducts and um</p>
<p>all of a sudden her Oliver and symptoms</p>
<p>went away and never had a problem since</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>that is some good good data to think</p>
<p>about when did it start what did you eat</p>
<p>just before that you know is there a</p>
<p>connection between your bile backing up</p>
<p>and affecting the heart versus the heart</p>
<p>itself it&rsquo;s just another uh thing to</p>
<p>look at if you haven&rsquo;t found any</p>
<p>problems with your heart interesting so</p>
<p>once again you are what you eat at some</p>
<p>level huh so gotta watch that yeah I</p>
<p>think so all right I think so let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>to a what we call a phone call now Maria</p>
<p>uh is uh with us and Maria if you can</p>
<p>hear us you&rsquo;re on with Dr Burr go ahead</p>
<p>with your your question</p>
<p>hi um thank you so I have a question one</p>
<p>of my relatives she&rsquo;s in her 60s</p>
<p>she took antibiotics for an UTI and then</p>
<p>um she got C diff clusterium difficile</p>
<p>infection</p>
<p>which was very bad she was then</p>
<p>hospitalized for it she took treatment</p>
<p>and then she did a test which was fine</p>
<p>after I think about 10 or two weeks but</p>
<p>then now</p>
<p>um so her gut her stomach is is not 100</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s not back to normal she&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>eating food as if as if she still has</p>
<p>diarrhea and and her I mean yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just not all back to normal she&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>very afraid that the infection will come</p>
<p>back because the doctor said it can come</p>
<p>back so my I have two or three questions</p>
<p>here one what can we do or what can she</p>
<p>do in order for the infection to well in</p>
<p>order to decrease the risk of the</p>
<p>infection coming back</p>
<p>um if there if there&rsquo;s anything to eat</p>
<p>or anything she can do to to decrease</p>
<p>that risk and then how can she heal her</p>
<p>hers mic or digestive issues</p>
<p>and then lastly</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been reading about probiotics some</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s great to take them and others</p>
<p>say well if you have this infection</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t take that so that&rsquo;s it yeah</p>
<p>C diff is the pathogen or she has the</p>
<p>pathogenic form</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>the antidote for this is completely 100</p>
<p>percent a probiotic in fact this is why</p>
<p>anytime you anyone takes antibi</p>
<p>antibiotics they need to take a</p>
<p>probiotic because that protects you</p>
<p>against things like C diff salmonella if</p>
<p>you just look up our research on</p>
<p>uh taking in a a probiotic for C diff</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to find a lot of great</p>
<p>research because</p>
<p>what is the other solution another</p>
<p>antibiotic what&rsquo;s happening is that</p>
<p>these microbes</p>
<p>are extremely intelligent they start</p>
<p>developing antibiotic resistance and not</p>
<p>only that</p>
<p>they do what&rsquo;s called horizontal DNA</p>
<p>transfer which means they transfer this</p>
<p>information to their friends and now all</p>
<p>the microbes are are resistant</p>
<p>to in several antibiotics and now what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to happen you&rsquo;re going to take a</p>
<p>stronger one and a stronger one if you</p>
<p>look at the devastating long-term</p>
<p>effects of antibiotics or especially the</p>
<p>effects from taking long-term</p>
<p>antibiotics</p>
<p>you are um for a shock because it can</p>
<p>literally make someone disabled</p>
<p>permanently disabled neurologically</p>
<p>arthritis you know it&rsquo;s um that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>antibiotics are just like honestly</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re not the solution only if</p>
<p>absolutely necessary and very sparingly</p>
<p>because we not only dependent uh depend</p>
<p>on our on these microbes we can&rsquo;t live</p>
<p>without them and so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>now the probiotic is the only solution</p>
<p>right now and uh also um you know like</p>
<p>fermented foods the sauerkraut very very</p>
<p>important it&rsquo;s probably kefir would be</p>
<p>good</p>
<p>um and then</p>
<p>you want to start supporting uh the</p>
<p>barriers to microbes um like the first</p>
<p>barriers the acid in the stomach make</p>
<p>sure she has enough acid in the stomach</p>
<p>um taking garlic is a good um thing to</p>
<p>help kill</p>
<p>the bad bad guy but it won&rsquo;t affect the</p>
<p>good good bacteria</p>
<p>um so your main defense against these</p>
<p>pathogens is the is your micro</p>
<p>microbiome and so the diversity and the</p>
<p>numbers of microbes are</p>
<p>the most important thing that I would</p>
<p>recommend to counter this and then</p>
<p>going forward eating foods to support</p>
<p>the microbiome will then prevent the</p>
<p>infection from coming back you got to</p>
<p>think about the immune system that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s a defense</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the ultimate um solution</p>
<p>um versus another thing to kill off</p>
<p>something which then you&rsquo;re not think</p>
<p>looking at the whole picture</p>
<p>all right</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s right well thank you Maria</p>
<p>so much and by the way Maria&rsquo;s was from</p>
<p>Greece so it&rsquo;s nice to know that people</p>
<p>from all around the globe are uh</p>
<p>checking in and that was uh fun to have</p>
<p>her on let&rsquo;s go to the next Quiz</p>
<p>question this one is not a true false</p>
<p>and here it is</p>
<p>all right what is the primary reason why</p>
<p>vitamin D does not create</p>
<p>uh effects it&rsquo;s supposed to so in other</p>
<p>words let&rsquo;s say you take vitamin D and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s such it&rsquo;s been claimed that you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s supposed to get rid of this and</p>
<p>help you with this and inflammation and</p>
<p>all of a sudden you take it and it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work what&rsquo;s the primary reason</p>
<p>all right climb on it audience it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>working now here&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>question from Facebook Michelle is it</p>
<p>easier for your body to digest</p>
<p>vegetables if they are Juiced or put in</p>
<p>a blender</p>
<p>well obviously it&rsquo;s going to be easier</p>
<p>with the juicing but you&rsquo;re gonna it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a complete product you want the</p>
<p>whole thing because the juice</p>
<p>um does give you some vitamins and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good for certain things like if you had</p>
<p>a gut problem right but ideally the</p>
<p>fiber is more beneficial unless you have</p>
<p>gut inflammation okay then I would</p>
<p>probably go for the juice but I wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do add add juice from an apple or a</p>
<p>carrot just the actual vegetable if you</p>
<p>want to um you know spike your nutrients</p>
<p>things like that but um</p>
<p>yes but it some people have a hard time</p>
<p>digesting fiber so um you want to test</p>
<p>the waters um</p>
<p>but I think this fiber is important</p>
<p>because it does feed the microbes</p>
<p>um but if you start bloating like crazy</p>
<p>back off and um find out why you may</p>
<p>have something called sibo small</p>
<p>intestinal bacterial overgrowth and then</p>
<p>you have to do a different protocol</p>
<p>all right well then that begs the</p>
<p>question from Facebook that was asked by</p>
<p>Tamara best diet advice for someone with</p>
<p>gastritis</p>
<p>I have a really good video on this</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>when you have gastritis chances are you</p>
<p>might have H pylori</p>
<p>which means that</p>
<p>um you probably got this problem in the</p>
<p>first place because your at your stomach</p>
<p>was was was not asked enough the problem</p>
<p>is adding more acid is going to worsen</p>
<p>the situation because it&rsquo;s inflamed so</p>
<p>we have to reduce the inflammation so um</p>
<p>zinc carnosine is a good solution</p>
<p>sometimes</p>
<p>um if you can tolerate cabbage</p>
<p>any form of cabbage you might find that</p>
<p>that greatly helps you</p>
<p>um and a good antidote to</p>
<p>um Ace pylori is sulforaphane which</p>
<p>happens to be not only in cabbage but in</p>
<p>Brock broccoli sprouts</p>
<p>so sulforaphane will kill off that</p>
<p>microbe or put it back in remission so</p>
<p>that would be a good solution</p>
<p>um so for gastritis you&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>to probably try to do more Probiotic</p>
<p>foods and but I have a whole protocol on</p>
<p>that if you want to watch my video on</p>
<p>that all right very good an audience it</p>
<p>was no mistake that I put up the Dr Berg</p>
<p>app which is uh downloadable on the app</p>
<p>store or off also on Google Play so he</p>
<p>keeps talking about videos well this is</p>
<p>probably the best way to sort your way</p>
<p>through the thousands of videos that he</p>
<p>has and find answers to your questions</p>
<p>and solutions so go get that right now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s free and again for the Star Trek</p>
<p>fans it&rsquo;s like the tricorder you can</p>
<p>diagnose your issue at the flip of a</p>
<p>thumb on your smartphone device okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s uh let&rsquo;s go and wrap up things in</p>
<p>the green room and we have uh pravina</p>
<p>and praveena is from Good Old Wichita</p>
<p>Kansas and let me unmute her and</p>
<p>praveena you are on with Dr Bird go</p>
<p>ahead with your question</p>
<p>hi Dr Burke thank you for giving me an</p>
<p>opportunity to speak with you I&rsquo;m very</p>
<p>glad to be here</p>
<p>um I have gone through several videos of</p>
<p>yours and I have a same problem you</p>
<p>mentioned that I have the right and</p>
<p>um right shoulder and neck pain for the</p>
<p>past seven years I have my MRI and x-ray</p>
<p>reports turned out to be normal and I</p>
<p>have been doing physical therapy and I</p>
<p>have gone to several chiropractitioners</p>
<p>and nothing worked</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ve been having this problem for</p>
<p>seven years and it&rsquo;s been bothering me a</p>
<p>lot</p>
<p>well join the club I had that problem</p>
<p>for actually I think 12 years</p>
<p>um yeah I know what it feels like and I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know it was wrong and I went to a</p>
<p>thousand chiropractors and never worked</p>
<p>so uh definitely um I would watch the</p>
<p>videos on gallbladder and do that manual</p>
<p>massage underneath your right rib cage</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s about one inch below the rib cage</p>
<p>uh to the right and off about an inch</p>
<p>off the midline and you start massaging</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll be a little bit tender but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll actually create some nice</p>
<p>drainage there and your shoulder pain</p>
<p>will just feel a little looser and then</p>
<p>you probably want to get the tadka and</p>
<p>get on a healthy version of Keto okay</p>
<p>and then find out what you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s causing the gallbladder to back</p>
<p>up</p>
<p>and that is really the main issue and if</p>
<p>you go in that area you will resolve it</p>
<p>um to the point where you won&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>that pin anymore I had it for so long</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t know what it was</p>
<p>I was also diagnosed with um hiatal</p>
<p>hernia in 2015 and my shoulder and neck</p>
<p>pain started around the same time so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking maybe those are interrelated</p>
<p>and so I have constant belching</p>
<p>um like it&rsquo;s a silent belching I have</p>
<p>even if I drink water I have the</p>
<p>belching so is that anything so so if</p>
<p>you look at one of the symptoms one of</p>
<p>the main symptoms of gallbladder it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>burping and then you&rsquo;re belching and</p>
<p>bloating those three so we&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>right thing uh you just need more bile</p>
<p>salts and then you need to do the manual</p>
<p>massage</p>
<p>not just for allowing for drainage but</p>
<p>also for that hiatal hernia watch my</p>
<p>videos on what to do about that it&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>a great technique give you a lot of</p>
<p>relief and so that way you have</p>
<p>something you can do immediately to keep</p>
<p>you out of pain but to try to it&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of pick when you step in a dog&rsquo;s tail he</p>
<p>barks through his mouth right</p>
<p>I think he barks to his mouth so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to mess with the mouth he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to bite you so take the pressure</p>
<p>off the tail work on the gallbladder</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the origin this is the</p>
<p>dog barking up here</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>if I talk to my doctor how do I</p>
<p>um tell them to diagnose if I have a</p>
<p>gallbladder issue well I would make if</p>
<p>you if you wanted to go that route I</p>
<p>would find a a gastro doctor that can</p>
<p>evaluate a functional test with the flow</p>
<p>of bile to rule out something called</p>
<p>choleostasis</p>
<p>cholestasis is the sluggishness of bile</p>
<p>flowing through the bile ducts</p>
<p>say Doc do you want to do a test to rule</p>
<p>out choleostasis and then</p>
<p>and then uh</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m gonna I&rsquo;m gonna take um the</p>
<p>remedy and this is a medical remedy it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take a Purify bile salts as</p>
<p>a remedy I don&rsquo;t want to take medication</p>
<p>give me purified salts or just order</p>
<p>online and</p>
<p>um get that test done you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>start doing</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>CAT scans MRIs at this level because I</p>
<p>think a functional test would pick it up</p>
<p>a lot faster or an ultrasound which is</p>
<p>more non-invasive but of course I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>your medical doctor so take it with a</p>
<p>grain of salt</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great thank you so much pravina</p>
<p>and uh please get back with us and let</p>
<p>us know all the great things uh that</p>
<p>resolve by listening to uh Dr Berg and</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m going to come on Dr bird because</p>
<p>this is really interesting this sort of</p>
<p>referred pain so one time I had terrible</p>
<p>chest pain about 30 years ago and I</p>
<p>thought you know what if Lori comes home</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m blue on the bed and dead I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna be in trouble so I went to the</p>
<p>hospital</p>
<p>and had no signs of any cardiac stuff</p>
<p>the blood didn&rsquo;t show anything and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had that over the years and here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>bizarre thing this chain you know I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s Digestive and it refers pain</p>
<p>to my jaw which is a classic symptom of</p>
<p>a heart attack my teeth hurt and um it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>but obviously you know it ain&rsquo;t my heart</p>
<p>in this case because I&rsquo;ve been checked</p>
<p>what on Earth would cause that weird</p>
<p>referred pain especially one I mean it</p>
<p>never didn&rsquo;t hurt on my arm so that was</p>
<p>another classic one but my teeth would</p>
<p>hurt and to scared the uh bejesus out of</p>
<p>me so what could cause such a thing well</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s two things</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s such a thing called referred</p>
<p>pain so when you have a problem on one</p>
<p>side of your body uh it causes referred</p>
<p>pain on another side</p>
<p>um just like just like even heart well</p>
<p>shoot pain down the left arm why is that</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s the referred pain now</p>
<p>pain into the jaw could be a heart but</p>
<p>it could also be relating to your</p>
<p>digestion because if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>um a backup into the bile ducts okay it</p>
<p>can create swelling inflammation</p>
<p>right underneath your diaphragm yeah and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just so happens to be a nerve</p>
<p>called the free Nick and it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>on the right side it&rsquo;s on the left side</p>
<p>too so that nerve can start backing up</p>
<p>the bowel ducts which do cross over to</p>
<p>your pancreas</p>
<p>and that can affect the backup of the</p>
<p>pancreas too so this is why you can get</p>
<p>it on the left side or the right side</p>
<p>and it can go right up into the neck it</p>
<p>can go up into the jaw and go up into</p>
<p>the head</p>
<p>um and this is why</p>
<p>um it is so important</p>
<p>to take a like a holistic approach and</p>
<p>go okay when did this start what did I</p>
<p>do just before this started oh huh this</p>
<p>is what I ate no wonder</p>
<p>and then you start noticing that wow do</p>
<p>I have a lot of issue with my digestion</p>
<p>right now after I</p>
<p>ate those Foods or did something and</p>
<p>then then it all makes sense interesting</p>
<p>um yeah all right well I think the</p>
<p>question made sense our third one which</p>
<p>asked what is the primary reason why</p>
<p>vitamin D does not create the effects</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s supposed to and uh Terry has</p>
<p>collected some data where 55 percent of</p>
<p>our respondents say a K2 deficiency 20</p>
<p>say high sugar or carb intake 20 say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a potassium or magnesium deficiency</p>
<p>and five percent say it&rsquo;s a Calcium</p>
<p>deficiency uh anybody on the right track</p>
<p>yeah everyone is on the right track for</p>
<p>sure magnesium and calcium and these</p>
<p>other factors but there&rsquo;s another big</p>
<p>reason and that has to do with the</p>
<p>person is just not taking enough</p>
<p>in order to create certain effects</p>
<p>especially with your immune system</p>
<p>especially with inflammation it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>concentration dependent which means</p>
<p>you need more and given the fact that</p>
<p>a great good percentage of the</p>
<p>population like it could be 25 percent</p>
<p>or up to even 50 percent of the</p>
<p>population has these genetic um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called variance or weaknesses</p>
<p>um for the Vitamin D receptor</p>
<p>um normal amounts of vitamin D won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work for them</p>
<p>they have to have higher amounts and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a perfect example of that</p>
<p>um the typical</p>
<p>amount thousand six hundred won&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>for me I have to take ten thousand</p>
<p>twenty thousand to to see any change at</p>
<p>all now if you add that on top of the</p>
<p>fact that let&rsquo;s say you have insulin</p>
<p>resistance let&rsquo;s say that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>overweight</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say that you&rsquo;re over the age of 50</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting older right which</p>
<p>makes it even more difficult to</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>absorb vitamin D and let&rsquo;s say for</p>
<p>example you&rsquo;re on statins or you&rsquo;re um</p>
<p>on a low cholesterol diet the very thing</p>
<p>that makes vitamin D in the first place</p>
<p>or you have your gallbladder removed and</p>
<p>now you don&rsquo;t have the bile to be able</p>
<p>to absorb vitamin D so there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>things that can affect the absorption so</p>
<p>the common the solution is just to take</p>
<p>more vitamin D</p>
<p>and uh if you&rsquo;re concerned about</p>
<p>toxicity watch my videos on that but</p>
<p>that that could be just the solution</p>
<p>that you needed to take more</p>
<p>and all of a sudden wow it works I mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the interesting book out there</p>
<p>that you can look look up it&rsquo;s a high</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about written by a medical doctor</p>
<p>and he talks about high uh dosage of</p>
<p>vitamin D he&rsquo;s he takes like</p>
<p>a hundred thousand IUS of vitamin D3</p>
<p>um and for some people that might be</p>
<p>necessary short term but vitamin D what</p>
<p>it can do for inflammation and for the</p>
<p>immune system is just mind-blowing</p>
<p>mind-blowing it uh especially for</p>
<p>autoimmune diseases so I&rsquo;m going to be</p>
<p>releasing some videos on that so you</p>
<p>have the understanding of like how it</p>
<p>works which is going to be more</p>
<p>motivating than just someone saying oh I</p>
<p>heard a study that if you take this it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to lower your risk like that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>good enough for me I need to know why</p>
<p>all right very good well we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>put up one more question then it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be an absolute marathon with</p>
<p>answering questions from social media so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get this done then over to social</p>
<p>media for the rest of the show</p>
<p>all right out of all the cancers</p>
<p>in the world what is the most common</p>
<p>type of cancer that</p>
<p>um you know like the most common cancer</p>
<p>that shows up in people</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s a dreary fact I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>but anyway all sorts of ways to to live</p>
<p>a healthier life all right as promised</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go to social media on Facebook</p>
<p>again it&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>Ella El Andra oh elandra oh I can&rsquo;t ever</p>
<p>pronounce these things okay I&rsquo;m on a</p>
<p>48-hour fasting to my blood glucose and</p>
<p>Ketone levels are perfect I am a keto</p>
<p>vegan and now at my goal weight uh and</p>
<p>BMI I feel amazing thank you Dr Berg I</p>
<p>guess that wasn&rsquo;t a question but a</p>
<p>statement so that&rsquo;s wonderful good for</p>
<p>you glad that uh that&rsquo;s awesome it sure</p>
<p>is let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>okay repan from Facebook what are the</p>
<p>best vitamins or supplements to address</p>
<p>constant fatigue</p>
<p>foreign</p>
<p>B1 is a really good one uh there&rsquo;s many</p>
<p>others as well</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s say like let&rsquo;s say someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>on a Statin drug what they might if</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not taking coenzyme Q10 they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be tired their heart&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be tired they&rsquo;re going to have muscle</p>
<p>pain</p>
<p>um if they took some Cohen&rsquo;s mq-10 boom</p>
<p>magically better</p>
<p>um you could be also tired because you</p>
<p>have a an activation of Epstein-Barr</p>
<p>virus because you went through a bout of</p>
<p>stress in which case</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re going to have to deal with the</p>
<p>stress but out of all the things that</p>
<p>can help you increase energy the spark</p>
<p>plug to activate the motor would be</p>
<p>vitamin B1 I would try to find something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more natural but that should</p>
<p>increase your energy</p>
<p>as long as your diet is correct you know</p>
<p>um for years I was searching for the</p>
<p>vitamin that would give me energy and</p>
<p>nothing worked of course I never changed</p>
<p>my diet I just thought I could take a</p>
<p>vitamin and I had a warehouse of</p>
<p>vitamins I would be driving down the</p>
<p>street with my wife and say honey let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go to that at a health food store maybe</p>
<p>I could find a vitamin and I would buy a</p>
<p>bunch and take all these vitamins</p>
<p>nothing ever worked</p>
<p>um so it wasn&rsquo;t until I changed my diet</p>
<p>lower the carbs that I started feeling</p>
<p>better and I was like an I was sold this</p>
<p>whole diet thing does does work</p>
<p>all right very good the audience has</p>
<p>left on the last question for the day</p>
<p>which asked what is the most common type</p>
<p>of cancer</p>
<p>and uh 55 percent of our respondents oh</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m at the wrong one number</p>
<p>four 62 percent of our respondents say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the dreary pancreatic cancer 28 say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s skin cancer and 10 say it&rsquo;s colon</p>
<p>cancer</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s breast cancer oh my goodness well</p>
<p>audience you certainly name some bad</p>
<p>cancers so I think you deserve credit</p>
<p>for that pancreatic is just awful that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a very few survivors of that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not it&rsquo;s not as common but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more deadly but to think about what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting about breast cancer is that</p>
<p>um one big risk factor which you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t think is connected as much as</p>
<p>is smoking now you think just smoking is</p>
<p>like oh it&rsquo;s just going to be lung</p>
<p>cancer no not necessarily because in</p>
<p>that uh tobacco smoke you have about 700</p>
<p>different chemicals</p>
<p>which are carcinogenic and they that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what the damage the cells in the breasts</p>
<p>and the colon and sets you up for a uh</p>
<p>potential cancer so smoking is a big</p>
<p>risk factor not just for lung</p>
<p>all right uh Diana wants to know when uh</p>
<p>should bile salt be taken before after a</p>
<p>meal and what is the maximum amount we</p>
<p>should take daily</p>
<p>you take it after the meal because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>your stomach should be acid right and</p>
<p>before you eat and then because bile is</p>
<p>alkaline so if you take it before the</p>
<p>meal it&rsquo;s not going to work it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to neutralize the acid stomach and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll probably not feel that great so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always to take after the fact to</p>
<p>help you with those the digestion of fat</p>
<p>as far as the amounts go it really</p>
<p>depends on you know the milligram per</p>
<p>tablet but I would recommend let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just doing</p>
<p>um one after a meal I would go up to</p>
<p>maybe three or four if you have a big</p>
<p>problem but I wouldn&rsquo;t keep going I</p>
<p>would probably stay at four and um I</p>
<p>would switch gears to take things to</p>
<p>acidify my stomach because the bile</p>
<p>ducts are also triggered by acids so if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t so if you&rsquo;re taking all this</p>
<p>bile and the real problem is like wow I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have enough stomach acid then it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not the best solution so I I kind of</p>
<p>always like to also make sure that your</p>
<p>stomach is acidic enough so I might</p>
<p>recommend a really good amount of potato</p>
<p>chloride that&rsquo;s the one that you can</p>
<p>really increase more and more and more</p>
<p>and all of a sudden you have more flow</p>
<p>of bile through the gallbladder</p>
<p>okay poor Debbie has got</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>plantar fasciitis and a pain in her</p>
<p>Achilles heel and cramped uh calf man</p>
<p>she is stumbling around what what can we</p>
<p>do for Debbie</p>
<p>well I would automatically do the the</p>
<p>stretch that I recommend which is</p>
<p>definitely not the calf stretch stretch</p>
<p>the opposite muscle the muscle on the</p>
<p>shin the the front of your your lower</p>
<p>leg and I show you how to do it on the</p>
<p>video</p>
<p>um if you want to watch the video and</p>
<p>that will give you some instant relief</p>
<p>the other thing about plantar fasciitis</p>
<p>is um you probably want more a good</p>
<p>amount of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty</p>
<p>acids and cut down see omega-3 fatty</p>
<p>acids the fish oils the cod liver oil</p>
<p>does not work if you are also at the</p>
<p>same time consuming too many omega-6</p>
<p>fatty acids because they compete so you</p>
<p>got to get rid of the sixes now you</p>
<p>might say well I don&rsquo;t eat corn oil or</p>
<p>so soy oil</p>
<p>when in fact you&rsquo;re maybe Downing a lot</p>
<p>of chicken which is mostly like omega-6</p>
<p>fed</p>
<p>um or maybe you&rsquo;re doing a lot of peanut</p>
<p>butter or seeds or</p>
<p>um or let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re uh there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of hidden like you&rsquo;re going out to</p>
<p>dinner a lot and uh just they just</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many things that they add</p>
<p>that vitamin that omega-6 fatty acids</p>
<p>like even yesterday for example I go in</p>
<p>the fridge</p>
<p>I take up my olives</p>
<p>and of course I need glasses now to read</p>
<p>these small prints so I look at the the</p>
<p>ingredients for these olives and it says</p>
<p>they come in olive oil or Canola and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like what</p>
<p>and you know they&rsquo;re putting canola oil</p>
<p>in that Olive in the olives I&rsquo;m like you</p>
<p>got to be kidding me can&rsquo;t we just uh</p>
<p>have the regular olive oil is it is it</p>
<p>that expensive or we just can&rsquo;t put it</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>you know they sneak it into these Foods</p>
<p>hummus for example they put the soy oil</p>
<p>or canola oil why because it&rsquo;s cheap so</p>
<p>unfortunately you don&rsquo;t need it in your</p>
<p>body</p>
<p>wow we I tell you why don&rsquo;t we end at a</p>
<p>high note Anna from Facebook hello Dr</p>
<p>Berg soaking up all this information</p>
