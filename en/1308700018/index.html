    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Our card this week is Dale Dinwiddie, the Nine of Diamonds from South Carolina.</p>
<p>In 1992, Dale was a 23-year-old woman enjoying a night out with friends when suddenly she</p>
<p>vanished from a crowded club, never to be seen again.</p>
<p>Maybe the right person listening to this episode will change that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>On September 24th, 1992, at 6.15 in the morning, Dan Dinwiddie was just getting out of bed.</p>
<p>He needed to let the family&rsquo;s dog out because he knew his teenage son Drew would sleep in</p>
<p>and not do it, and the dog always slept in Drew&rsquo;s room, so it fell on Dad to make sure</p>
<p>the morning potty break happened.</p>
<p>Dan shuffled down the hallway towards his son&rsquo;s room and was just about to open the</p>
<p>door when something else caught his eye.</p>
<p>The door to his daughter Dale&rsquo;s bedroom was slightly open.</p>
<p>When he peered inside, fully expecting to see his 23-year-old daughter asleep, she wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>The bed she slept in every night was empty, and based on the way the bedsheets and pillows</p>
<p>looked, it appeared as if no one had been there all night.</p>
<p>To make the scene even stranger was the fact that the radio and lights in the room were</p>
<p>still on.</p>
<p>Dale had recently moved back into the family&rsquo;s Columbia, South Carolina home after graduating</p>
<p>from a women&rsquo;s college in Virginia with a degree in art history.</p>
<p>She was back for the time being because she made plans to attend grad school that fall</p>
<p>at the University of South Carolina.</p>
<p>Dan immediately thought the sight of Dale&rsquo;s empty bed was odd.</p>
<p>He knew she was going out to a concert the night before with some friends and figured</p>
<p>she would be out late, but he never heard her say that she wasn&rsquo;t coming home.</p>
<p>And he knew his daughter well enough to know that it was unlikely Dale was already dressed</p>
<p>and gone from the house that early in the morning on a Thursday.</p>
<p>She was scheduled to walk a neighborhood boy that she babysat to his bus stop, but that</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t until well after 6.15 in the morning.</p>
<p>There was no reason for her to be gone this early.</p>
<p>To try and get some answers, Dan woke up his wife, Jean, and Dale&rsquo;s brother, Drew, and</p>
<p>asked them if Dale had talked to them about maybe staying at a friend&rsquo;s house the night</p>
<p>before or something, but they both said no.</p>
<p>Now, you might be thinking like, okay, take a breath, she&rsquo;s an adult, she could come and</p>
<p>go freely if she wanted to, and it&rsquo;s true, she could, but doing it without any communication</p>
<p>was just super out of character for her.</p>
<p>According to Dan, who spoke with our team for this episode, Dale always kept in close</p>
<p>contact with her parents, especially if she knew she was going to be out late.</p>
<p>In fact, from time to time, Dale would even call her parents for a ride if she needed</p>
<p>one, even if it was late at night.</p>
<p>But Dan knew that Dale had not called them Wednesday night and she had not called them</p>
<p>early Thursday morning either.</p>
<p>That was a clear sign to them that something was up.</p>
<p>But Dale not being in contact with anyone in her family wasn&rsquo;t even the biggest red</p>
<p>flag that worried Dan.</p>
<p>What really concerned him was the fact that Dale was scheduled to accompany that neighborhood</p>
<p>boy to his bus stop that morning.</p>
<p>Her skipping out on that task was even more out of character.</p>
<p>Dale was known to be a responsible person and she wouldn&rsquo;t just no-show for work, even</p>
<p>if it was just a babysitting gig.</p>
<p>One of the first things Dan did to try and figure out what was going on was to start</p>
<p>calling all of their neighbors and friends to see if Dale had stayed the night with any</p>
<p>of them.</p>
<p>Dale&rsquo;s mom called the parents of the boy who Dale babysat to let them know she was</p>
<p>missing and wouldn&rsquo;t be available to watch him that day.</p>
<p>Then Jean and Dan started tag-teaming a list of everyone in their immediate community.</p>
<p>With each phone call, their hearts sank more and more.</p>
<p>No one had seen Dale and no one knew where she was.</p>
<p>Eventually, Dan was able to reach some of Dale&rsquo;s friends that she&rsquo;d been with at</p>
<p>that concert the night before.</p>
<p>But they said she wasn&rsquo;t with them anymore and they hadn&rsquo;t seen her since after the</p>
<p>concert when they all went to a bar near the University of South Carolina&rsquo;s campus.</p>
<p>So after that conversation, realizing that no one had seen Dale for several hours, Dan</p>
<p>called the police at 8.30 in the morning.</p>
<p>Our reporter Emily went to South Carolina to interview the cold case detective assigned</p>
<p>to this case to learn everything we could about Dale&rsquo;s timeline that night.</p>
<p>His name is Detective Kevin Reese, and he&rsquo;s a longtime investigator with the Columbia</p>
<p>Police Department.</p>
<p>In 2020, he was assigned to reinvestigate Dale&rsquo;s disappearance, which is now the city&rsquo;s</p>
<p>oldest missing persons case.</p>
<p>In his investigation, Kevin&rsquo;s sequence of events about what happened to Dale goes like</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night, September 23rd, a friend picked Dale up from her parents&rsquo; house to</p>
<p>go to a U2 concert at Williams-Brice Stadium at USC&rsquo;s campus.</p>
<p>The invitation to go to this concert was totally last minute and not something planned</p>
<p>days ahead of time.</p>
<p>Before her ride showed up, Dale put on her favorite pair of faded blue jeans, a green</p>
<p>shirt and tennis shoes.</p>
<p>She tied an L.L. Bean jacket around her waist and headed out the door.</p>
<p>Based on what her friends told police, everyone in Dale&rsquo;s group had a great time at the concert,</p>
<p>and it ended around 11.15 p.m.</p>
<p>After that, Dale and some of her close friends went to a bar called Jungle Gyms, which was</p>
<p>in the popular Five Points district in downtown Columbia.</p>
<p>Five Points is a spot where college kids bar hop, and it pretty much looks the same today</p>
<p>as it did back in 1992.</p>
<p>All the restaurants and bars in that area are lined up on the same road, so it&rsquo;s easy</p>
<p>to go from one place to another.</p>
<p>Now, Jungle Gyms isn&rsquo;t open anymore, in fact it closed a long time ago, and at one point</p>
<p>reopened as another bar called The Horseshoe.</p>
<p>But that business later closed as well, and today the building is just a dilapidated eyesore.</p>
<p>But back in its heyday, it was normal for the street it&rsquo;s on to be a busy late-night</p>
<p>spot.</p>
<p>Kevin said the night that Dale was there, the bar was reportedly really busy.</p>
<p>USC&rsquo;s fall semester was just about to kick off, plus crowds from the U2 concert packed</p>
<p>into Five Points bars.</p>
<p>Back in 1992, investigators learned from speaking with Dale&rsquo;s friends and a few witnesses</p>
<p>inside the bar that around one in the morning on Thursday, Dale got separated from her group.</p>
<p>Kevin Reese said that according to what he&rsquo;s pieced together from the investigative file,</p>
<p>one of Dale&rsquo;s last known conversations before she vanished was with a bouncer working the</p>
<p>door at Jungle Gyms.</p>
<p>She was at the concert with several of her friends.</p>
<p>Somehow she got disattached from her friends in the massive crowd down there, and so she</p>
<p>may have been asking questions, have you seen this person?</p>
<p>And whoever she asked questions may have already been familiar with the person that</p>
<p>she asked questions about.</p>
<p>Kevin thinks Dale&rsquo;s interaction with the bouncer was her attempt at trying to find</p>
<p>her friends.</p>
<p>She specifically asked him if he&rsquo;d seen the group she&rsquo;d come in with leave without</p>
<p>her or if he knew where they were, but he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Kevin believes wholeheartedly that this brief conversation and the moments before and after</p>
<p>are key to the investigation.</p>
<p>I think the conversation was about, and I don&rsquo;t know whether Dale brought it up or</p>
<p>somebody in the club would have found reason to ask Dale, are you lost?</p>
<p>Pretty much in an environment like that, a lot of people know a lot of people.</p>
<p>That knows a lot of people.</p>
<p>I would be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t put it to you like this.</p>
<p>Somebody down there knew somebody that knew somebody that knew somebody.</p>
<p>Something about this response definitely makes me think he knows more about who those somebodies</p>
<p>are and how they fit into Dale&rsquo;s last sighting, but it&rsquo;s probably information police want</p>
<p>to keep close to the vest, even all these years later.</p>
<p>The only other helpful information the Jungle Jim&rsquo;s bouncer provided was that he remembered</p>
<p>it being around 1.30 in the morning when he last saw Dale.</p>
<p>He told police that he watched her try and find her friends in the bar for a little bit,</p>
<p>and then she left in kind of a hurry.</p>
<p>When he last noticed her, he said that she was walking alone toward a nearby intersection</p>
<p>that was just north of the bar.</p>
<p>Kevin Reese says that nugget of information became very important to the investigation</p>
<p>because it opened up a world of possibilities as to what happened next to Dale.</p>
<p>In the days following Dale&rsquo;s disappearance, police were running several scenarios of what</p>
<p>could have happened.</p>
<p>One, she walked off on her own.</p>
<p>Her family and friends strongly opposed this scenario because they said Dale would never</p>
<p>just walk away from her life.</p>
<p>She had goals and dreams, even plans for grad school.</p>
<p>Not to mention her family said she had a big fear of being alone.</p>
<p>They told police it just wasn&rsquo;t possible that Dale would be willing to decide to disappear</p>
<p>and start a new life somewhere alone.</p>
<p>There was also the fact that she had left all of her belongings behind at her family&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>If she was going to run away, her parents didn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d leave her personal possessions</p>
<p>behind like that.</p>
<p>There was also no serious boyfriend in Dale&rsquo;s life who could have talked her into running off.</p>
<p>The second theory law enforcement considered was that maybe Dale had been in an accident.</p>
<p>Maybe it was possible that when Dale left Jungle Gyms walking towards the intersection,</p>
<p>that was her way of giving up her search for her friends and she just decided to walk home.</p>
<p>And then maybe she&rsquo;d been hit by a car or fallen and was still out there somewhere.</p>
<p>In 1992, police searched all of the streets, parking lots, and ditches between where Jungle</p>
<p>Gyms was and Dale&rsquo;s house, but detectives didn&rsquo;t find any sign of her.</p>
<p>The idea that Dale was just injured somewhere started to become less and less likely.</p>
<p>Dan and Jean kept telling investigators over and over again that their daughter would never</p>
<p>walk home alone at 1.30 in the morning.</p>
<p>It just wasn&rsquo;t in her nature.</p>
<p>They said it would have been far more likely for her to call them for a ride or to get</p>
<p>picked up by a friend, specifically because they said Dale was extremely wary of strangers</p>
<p>and wouldn&rsquo;t even get into taxi cabs by herself.</p>
<p>So that information led police to strongly consider the last and most frightening theory,</p>
<p>which was that Dale was abducted.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a scenario cold case investigator Kevin Reese strongly believes today.</p>
<p>There was somebody left around there, and my guess is friends of hers would never have</p>
<p>done anything to her, which to me means it was a total stranger to her.</p>
<p>A total stranger, according to these documents, Dale wouldn&rsquo;t have given them the time of</p>
<p>the day, especially that time of night.</p>
<p>Never would have happened.</p>
<p>Right after Dale vanished, law enforcement announced that they were focusing more and</p>
<p>more on a kidnapping scenario.</p>
<p>Volunteers started putting up thousands of flyers all around the city of Columbia, particularly</p>
<p>in the Five Points District.</p>
<p>The biggest hurdle investigators had in front of them was the fact that they technically</p>
<p>had no crime scene, and they weren&rsquo;t even sure how long Dale remained in the Bar District</p>
<p>after walking out of Jungle Gyms that night.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes this case one of the difficult ones.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s never been a crime scene that&rsquo;s been established.</p>
<p>There was a location where Dale was last seen, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it a crime scene.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s the case here, then you find those people that was at that location.</p>
<p>You find friends, you find family, you find people, employees of the club, you find people</p>
<p>that frequented the club, and those kind of things, especially 30 years later, it takes</p>
<p>a lot of time and a lot of patience to get that done.</p>
<p>The mega popular band U2 being in town that night Dale vanished also presented some challenges</p>
<p>to investigators.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, their stadium show on USC&rsquo;s campus that night brought a lot of</p>
<p>people to Columbia who weren&rsquo;t from the area, which just expanded an already large</p>
<p>suspect and witness pool.</p>
<p>It would have attracted a lot of people here.</p>
<p>I knew about the U2 band, but I&rsquo;m not sure if I was familiar with that group 30 years</p>
<p>ago.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m familiar with them now, but it would have been easier for people to come in to</p>
<p>this area and the area of the football stadium just for that concert.</p>
<p>If Dale had disappeared on any other regular night in Columbia, finding witnesses who recognized</p>
<p>her, who may have seen her get into a car, might have been an easier task for authorities.</p>
<p>A few out-of-town witnesses did try to help law enforcement over the years, and there</p>
<p>have even been several occasions since 1992 where officers traveled out of state chasing</p>
<p>leads.</p>
<p>There were investigators that have left the Columbia area, found people whose names popped</p>
<p>up somehow, and asked them questions and interviewed them.</p>
<p>That did happen.</p>
<p>At one point, detectives&rsquo; dogged efforts paid off.</p>
<p>One of more than a thousand tips that came in about 10 years after Dale vanished led</p>
<p>investigators to look into a known serial killer, a man who just so happened to be in</p>
<p>Columbia the night Dale Dinwiddie went missing.</p>
<p>A man named Ronaldo Javier Rivera.</p>
<p>Rivera abducted, raped, and killed four different women in South Carolina and Georgia between</p>
<p>1999 and 2000.</p>
<p>And those are just the victims police know about.</p>
<p>He came on police&rsquo;s radar in 2003 when he approached an 18-year-old woman in South Carolina</p>
<p>in a restaurant parking lot and pretended to be the owner of an escort service and modeling</p>
<p>agency.</p>
<p>He asked if he could take some photos of the woman.</p>
<p>She agreed and invited him to her home.</p>
<p>Once inside, Rivera raped and stabbed the victim three times in the throat and left</p>
<p>her to die.</p>
<p>But somehow this woman survived the attack and she helped police identify her attacker.</p>
<p>Officers eventually tracked him down to a motel room in South Carolina and he was arrested.</p>
<p>Detectives working Dale&rsquo;s case got a tip and confirmed that back in 1992 when Rivera would</p>
<p>have been 24, he was a student at the University of South Carolina and living in Columbia when</p>
<p>Dale disappeared.</p>
<p>According to a 2004 Associated Press brief that appeared in the Greenville News, Rivera</p>
<p>was originally from North Augusta, South Carolina and during his 2004 trial, his attorney tried</p>
<p>to convince the jury that their client was mentally ill, but the jurors didn&rsquo;t agree.</p>
<p>He was 40 years old by the time he went on trial and after he was found guilty, he told</p>
<p>the jury he deserved to die.</p>
<p>According to reports by the Associated Press, which appeared in various news outlets in</p>
<p>South Carolina and Georgia, Rivera said that if he got the chance to kill again, he would.</p>
<p>He said he even still fantasized about hurting the women he killed.</p>
<p>According to the Georgia Department of Corrections, Rivera was convicted for that crime in January</p>
<p>2004 and later linked to several other rapes and murders.</p>
<p>He was sentenced to death in February 2004 and is still sitting on death row in Georgia</p>
<p>at the time of this recording, according to the Georgia Department of Corrections.</p>
<p>Though that all seems to make him a compelling person of interest, detectives have never</p>
<p>been able to officially connect Rivera to Dale&rsquo;s disappearance and he&rsquo;s never admitted</p>
<p>to being involved.</p>
<p>Because Dale is still a missing person and no trace of her body has ever shown up, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nothing for law enforcement to even compare Rivera&rsquo;s DNA to in relation to Dale&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>They have no evidence, at least not that we know of.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Rivera&rsquo;s only ever been accused of a few other murders from 1999, but he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never been formally accused of any killings prior to that.</p>
<p>Detective Reese said the coincidence of Rivera living in Columbia when Dale vanished is definitely</p>
<p>interesting, but he&rsquo;s unsure if it&rsquo;s simply that, just a coincidence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve entertained a lot of notions and that&rsquo;s what I do for a living.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t dismiss anything until I&rsquo;ve proven a reason that it should be dismissed.</p>
<p>Over the years, there have been reports of several sets of human bones being found in</p>
<p>Columbia and the greater Richland County area, but so far none of them have been identified</p>
<p>as belonging to Dale Dinwiddie.</p>
<p>Finding Dale&rsquo;s remains and continuing to press people from Columbia about the case</p>
<p>is a high priority for Reese.</p>
<p>Truly, if they had nothing to do with this case, then they would accept me at their door</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m asking them to repeat for me what they said 30 years ago and I have some</p>
<p>questions I want to piggyback off of those questions so that I can come up with some</p>
<p>answers that were never answered 30 years ago.</p>
<p>With or without Dale&rsquo;s body, there are some indisputable facts Detective Reese says</p>
<p>define the case in his unit&rsquo;s theory of what happened.</p>
<p>Remember, the bouncer at Jungle Gyms in 1992 told police that Dale was walking north away</p>
<p>from the bar at 1.30 in the morning and it looked like she was in a hurry.</p>
<p>Despite there being plenty of people out that night, no one other than that bouncer has</p>
<p>ever said they saw Dale after 1.30 in the morning on September 24th, 1992.</p>
<p>Because of that, police find it hard to believe that Dale was abducted right there in that</p>
<p>Five Points district if no one saw or heard anything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve theorized it&rsquo;s more likely she made it out of the busy bar district and was</p>
<p>isolated away from the crowds when she was abducted, essentially an area where there</p>
<p>would be no witnesses.</p>
<p>On the other hand, they can&rsquo;t entirely rule out the idea of her being taken in the middle</p>
<p>of the busy nightlife either.</p>
<p>Dale was tiny and petite and could have easily been overtaken in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>I mean, her family and police have said that she could have passed for a teenager.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how small she was.</p>
<p>But small or not, her family says that she no doubt would have put up a fight.</p>
<p>Even Kevin Reese says it&rsquo;s undoubtedly clear that what Dale lacked in physical size she</p>
<p>made up for in attitude.</p>
<p>She was not the type of person to take lip from anyone, especially men.</p>
<p>She sounds like she had all the qualities of a crime junkie, honestly.</p>
<p>For example, her friend says that when Dale would get hit on and was annoyed by it, which</p>
<p>happened a lot, she wouldn&rsquo;t just be polite and go along.</p>
<p>She would shut that kind of behavior down immediately.</p>
<p>She was a no nonsense kind of person.</p>
<p>She was a very beautiful young lady, petite.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like five feet, 90 pounds or so.</p>
<p>And she was so attractive.</p>
<p>A lot of guys were going to approach her.</p>
<p>And so Dale had the kind of spirit, according to this document, that when she has no interest</p>
<p>in you and you won&rsquo;t leave her alone, she will tell you that she has no interest in</p>
<p>you at all.</p>
<p>Now I think that&rsquo;s a pretty good characteristic to have, mainly because of the reason that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re here right now.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m glad she was that kind of person, because that tells me one thing.</p>
<p>It tells me that the chances of one of these people that actually knew Dale and was her</p>
<p>friends had anything to do with the disappearance of Dale Dinwiddie.</p>
<p>I could put that to the side.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to focus so much on that.</p>
<p>Detective Reese is convinced Dale was taken by a person who she did not know.</p>
<p>And that person likely killed her.</p>
<p>He also believes that the kidnapping scenario that the killer or killer&rsquo;s planned that</p>
<p>night was well thought out.</p>
<p>Detective Reese says that he has no doubt that during the last few minutes of Dale&rsquo;s</p>
<p>life, she was held against her will.</p>
<p>The problem is police just don&rsquo;t know exactly where or when that took place.</p>
<p>My position on this, and I&rsquo;m allowed to have a position because I&rsquo;m the lead investigator</p>
<p>on this, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>And so I have to generate in my mind, because it&rsquo;s nothing documented yet, about how I think</p>
<p>things would have happened and why they happened.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s a person out there that has something to do with the disappearance of</p>
<p>that young lady, I&rsquo;m of the mindset that that person was a total stranger.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m of the mindset that that is the kind of person that if Dale could have helped it,</p>
<p>she would never have let that person close enough to her to even touch her, let alone</p>
<p>to harm her.</p>
<p>The file the Columbia Police Department keeps on Dale&rsquo;s case is massive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just one evidence box.</p>
<p>It is multiple filing cabinets worth of documents and transcripts that line a couple of walls</p>
<p>at the Columbia Police Department.</p>
<p>The file that&rsquo;s amassed here in this building where we are, they&rsquo;re sort of like, tell me</p>
<p>if you know what this means, old school file cabinets, full of documents, full of files.</p>
<p>Kevin and his team have pored over thousands of pages of transcripts, reports, and interviews</p>
<p>that have been done over the years.</p>
<p>Many of the people critical to the case, including Dale&rsquo;s friends and the bouncer at Jungle</p>
<p>Gyms, have been re-interviewed several times over the years.</p>
<p>And Detective Reese said on some reports, there are names he hasn&rsquo;t completely cleared yet.</p>
<p>When you talk about suspects, I don&rsquo;t see anything in the file that, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned,</p>
<p>would compel me to say that person is a suspect.</p>
<p>I may say that person is a person of interest.</p>
<p>Then again, I may simply say that person is somebody that I would love to talk to.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s how I differentiate and separate the people that I&rsquo;m going to pay X amount</p>
<p>of attention to versus the next one and the next one and the next one.</p>
<p>You focus on everybody that you know had nothing to do with this, you&rsquo;re spinning your wheels</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be spinning your wheels for a long time.</p>
<p>Detective Reese says Dale&rsquo;s case doesn&rsquo;t just sit around and collect dust in his office.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s actively working different angles and going back to dig through the trove of investigative</p>
<p>files all the time.</p>
<p>His desk is literally within arm&rsquo;s reach of the filing cabinets that hold all the case</p>
<p>paperwork.</p>
<p>He said the whole reason he chose to work in the cold case unit is because he believes</p>
<p>solving cases like Dale&rsquo;s are his life&rsquo;s purpose.</p>
<p>You gotta get out and you gotta work for it.</p>
<p>You gotta knock on doors.</p>
<p>You gotta go in snake infested wooded areas when it&rsquo;s hot as hell out, you know, but we</p>
<p>get paid for it.</p>
<p>And some of us, we get paid by God for it as well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my goal, to bring resolution to every cold case that I&rsquo;m ever assigned to.</p>
<p>The benefit, I think, in respect to what benefits the family is simply knowing that you got</p>
<p>somebody that actually believes in what they&rsquo;re doing and actually believes that they can</p>
<p>do this and actually believes that you believe in the same thing or want the same thing they</p>
<p>want.</p>
<p>And that is resolution of the case.</p>
<p>And in Dale&rsquo;s case, mom and dad wants Dale home.</p>
<p>For him, Dale was every other young woman who walked the campuses of USC or grew up</p>
<p>in Columbia.</p>
<p>She was a bright girl, a good student, and came from a nice neighborhood in the city.</p>
<p>Today, her parents, Dan and Jean, still live in Columbia, but they have since moved out</p>
<p>of the house they raised their kids in.</p>
<p>They said Dale&rsquo;s empty bedroom was a daily reminder of their loss and it was just too</p>
<p>much to bear.</p>
<p>It was difficult to see their neighbor&rsquo;s children grow up and get married and have</p>
<p>children of their own while they were left with an empty hole in their lives.</p>
<p>When Emily was in South Carolina reporting on this story, she visited Dan and Jean.</p>
<p>Their walls are lined with artwork Dale sketched and they showed Emily pictures of Dale riding</p>
<p>horseback, a hobby she loved and shared with her mom.</p>
<p>The couple hosted Emily for a few hours sharing memories of Dale and flipping through her</p>
<p>old photo albums.</p>
<p>Actually, some of those photos are on our website, thedeckpodcast.com if you want to</p>
<p>see them.</p>
<p>Jean and Dan are in their 80s now and you can tell they&rsquo;ve been worn down from all</p>
<p>the years of searching for their daughter and doing interviews about her case.</p>
<p>In the three decades Dale has been missing, no amount of press her parents have done have</p>
<p>resulted in a break in the case.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just been a few false hopes over the years that have been tough blows.</p>
<p>For example, Dan said that one night many years ago, the Dinwiddie&rsquo;s home phone rang.</p>
<p>Dan rushed to pick it up and a man on the other end said, quote, I&rsquo;m staring at your</p>
<p>daughter.</p>
<p>Dan said he could tell from the background noise that the man was in a bar, maybe a restaurant,</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t sound drunk, he sounded genuine.</p>
<p>The man told Dan that he was at a bar in Wisconsin and the female bartender looked exactly like</p>
<p>the photo of Dale from their missing persons poster.</p>
<p>Dan alerted police in South Carolina, who asked authorities in Wisconsin to go check</p>
<p>it out.</p>
<p>Within a few hours, officers determined that the woman was not Dale.</p>
<p>They admitted that the bartender looked very similar to Dale, but she was much taller,</p>
<p>so even if she lied about her identity, there was no way it was her.</p>
<p>These types of phone calls and false leads became the norm for the Dinwiddie&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also pretty typical for cold case detectives to vet through.</p>
<p>Kevin Reese even mentioned that he fully expects to get some calls after our episode</p>
<p>airs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the nature of the job and working such an old cold case.</p>
<p>People hear this podcast, you&rsquo;ll probably, we&rsquo;ll probably be getting some crank phone</p>
<p>calls after, after that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t doubt it, but you know, if I get a million crank phone calls and one of these</p>
<p>calls that I thought was crank turned out to be the call I&rsquo;m waiting for, it&rsquo;s all worth</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Every day, Jean and Dan can&rsquo;t help but wonder what Dale&rsquo;s life would be like today.</p>
<p>She would be in her early fifties by now.</p>
<p>She might even have had kids of her own or grandkids.</p>
<p>In 2019, Dale&rsquo;s name popped back into headlines when another college woman was kidnapped from</p>
<p>the Five Points neighborhood.</p>
<p>According to a New York Post story from April 2019, USC senior Samantha Josephson was abducted</p>
<p>and murdered after she got into a car she thought was the Uber she ordered.</p>
<p>Authorities were able to pinpoint her last few movements and the fake Uber she got into</p>
<p>thanks to several surveillance cameras mounted outside of businesses in the Five Points area.</p>
<p>Surveillance cameras that weren&rsquo;t there back in 1992.</p>
<p>According to various news reports, the man driving the car that Samantha got into was</p>
<p>Nathaniel Rowland.</p>
<p>Authorities later proved that he locked her in pretty much from the moment she got inside.</p>
<p>Then he abducted and killed her.</p>
<p>Her body was later found by a turkey hunter not far from Columbia.</p>
<p>And police were quickly able to link Nathaniel to the crime because his car matched the one</p>
<p>seen on surveillance footage.</p>
<p>And he lived near where he left Samantha&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>According to WLTX-TV, Nathaniel Rowland was found guilty of Samantha&rsquo;s murder in July</p>
<p>2021, and he was sentenced to life in prison.</p>
<p>The New York Post reported in 2019 that the Dinwiddies spoke out in solidarity with Samantha&rsquo;s</p>
<p>And they wondered if they would have had a better idea of what happened to their daughter</p>
<p>if only modern-day technology like video cameras had been in place in the Five Points area</p>
<p>back in 1992.</p>
<p>According to Fitz News, the most recent lead that came in on Dale&rsquo;s case was in the fall</p>
<p>of 2020.</p>
<p>Around that time, a victim of sexual assault who was a minor told Columbia police that</p>
<p>the man who allegedly raped her made a comment during the attack that she, the victim, reminded</p>
<p>him of Dale Dinwiddie.</p>
<p>In the Fitz News article, it says in March of 2021, police served a search warrant on</p>
<p>this guy, an attorney from South Carolina.</p>
<p>The attorney was charged with several counts of committing lewd acts on a minor in 2002</p>
<p>and 2004, but police told the public that the raid and arrest had nothing to do with</p>
<p>the Dinwiddie case.</p>
<p>The department said that while they believed the alleged sex assault victim&rsquo;s story, detailing</p>
<p>what happened to her, they had no reason to believe her claims that her attacker said</p>
<p>she reminded him of Dale.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, though, rumors ran wild for weeks about this possible connection between</p>
<p>a politically connected attorney and one of South Carolina&rsquo;s most high-profile cold cases.</p>
<p>According to a source Fitz News quoted for their article on this development, the attorney,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s now in his 60s, was a regular at Jungle Gyms in the year 1992.</p>
<p>The newspaper even went as far as to say that the man was good friends with a bartender</p>
<p>at Jungle Gyms, who was working the bar the night Dale vanished.</p>
<p>But nothing significant has been reported about this man since police raided his house</p>
<p>in March of 2021, and police continue to deny any connections between him and what happened</p>
<p>to Dale.</p>
<p>So, like they&rsquo;ve been doing for three decades, the Dinwiddies continue to wait.</p>
<p>And every time the phone rings, they hope and wish that the person on the other end</p>
<p>of the line has the answers they&rsquo;ve been waiting for.</p>
<p>Information that will put an end to their 30-year nightmare.</p>
<p>Detective Reese hopes he can grant that wish.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason you leave the light on, on the front porch.</p>
<p>They expect you to come home.</p>
<p>The Dinwiddies expect their daughter to come home.</p>
<p>If I got anything to do with it, she&rsquo;ll get home, yeah.</p>
<p>If you know anything about the disappearance, abduction, or murder of Dale Dinwiddie, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>urged to call the Columbia Police Department at 803-749-5836.</p>
<p>Or you can call the South Carolina Crime Stoppers, where a significant reward is being offered.</p>
<p>You can reach them at 888-CRIME-SC.</p>
