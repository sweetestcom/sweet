    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Nick Bostrom, a philosopher at University of Oxford</p>
<p>and the director of the Future of Humanity Institute.</p>
<p>He has worked on fascinating and important ideas in existential risk, simulation hypothesis,</p>
<p>human enhancement ethics, and the risks of superintelligent AI systems, including in</p>
<p>his book, Superintelligence.</p>
<p>I can see talking to Nick multiple times in this podcast, many hours each time, because</p>
<p>he has done some incredible work in artificial intelligence, in technology, space, science,</p>
<p>and really philosophy in general, but we have to start somewhere.</p>
<p>This conversation was recorded before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic that</p>
<p>both Nick and I, I&rsquo;m sure, will have a lot to say about next time we speak, and perhaps</p>
<p>that is for the best, because the deepest lessons can be learned only in retrospect</p>
<p>when the storm has passed.</p>
<p>I do recommend you read many of his papers on the topic of existential risk, including</p>
<p>the technical report titled Global Catastrophic Risks Survey that he coauthored with Anders</p>
<p>Sandberg.</p>
<p>For everyone feeling the medical, psychological, and financial burden of this crisis, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sending love your way.</p>
<p>Stay strong.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in this together.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll beat this thing.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, review it with five stars on Apple Podcast, support</p>
<p>it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M</p>
<p>A N.</p>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;ll do one or two minutes of ads now and never any ads in the middle that</p>
<p>can break the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope that works for you and doesn&rsquo;t hurt the listening experience.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>When you get it, use code LEXPODCAST.</p>
<p>Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with</p>
<p>as little as one dollar.</p>
<p>Since Cash App does fractional share trading, let me mention that the order execution algorithm</p>
<p>that works behind the scenes to create the abstraction of fractional orders is an algorithmic</p>
<p>marvel.</p>
<p>So big props to the Cash App engineers for solving a hard problem that in the end provides</p>
<p>an easy interface that takes a step up to the next layer of abstraction over the stock</p>
<p>market, making trading more accessible for new investors and diversification much easier.</p>
<p>So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store, Google Play, and use the code LEXPODCAST,</p>
<p>you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, an organization that is helping</p>
<p>to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Nick Bostrom.</p>
<p>At the risk of asking the Beatles to play yesterday or the Rolling Stones to play Satisfaction,</p>
<p>let me ask you the basics.</p>
<p>What is the simulation hypothesis?</p>
<p>That we are living in a computer simulation.</p>
<p>What is a computer simulation?</p>
<p>How are we supposed to even think about that?</p>
<p>Well, so the hypothesis is meant to be understood in a literal sense, not that we can kind of</p>
<p>metaphorically view the universe as an information processing physical system, but that there</p>
<p>is some advanced civilization who built a lot of computers and that what we experience</p>
<p>is an effect of what&rsquo;s going on inside one of those computers so that the world around</p>
<p>us, our own brains, everything we see and perceive and think and feel would exist because</p>
<p>this computer is running certain programs.</p>
<p>So do you think of this computer as something similar to the computers of today, these deterministic</p>
<p>sort of Turing machine type things?</p>
<p>Is that what we&rsquo;re supposed to imagine or we&rsquo;re supposed to think of something more</p>
<p>like a quantum mechanical system?</p>
<p>Something much bigger, something much more complicated, something much more mysterious</p>
<p>from our current perspective?</p>
<p>The ones we have today would do fine, I mean, bigger, certainly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d need more memory and more processing power.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anything else would be required.</p>
<p>Now, it might well be that they do have additional, maybe they have quantum computers and other</p>
<p>things that would give them even more of, it seems kind of plausible, but I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a necessary assumption in order to get to the conclusion that a technologically</p>
<p>mature civilization would be able to create these kinds of computer simulations with conscious</p>
<p>beings inside them.</p>
<p>So do you think the simulation hypothesis is an idea that&rsquo;s most useful in philosophy,</p>
<p>computer science, physics, sort of where do you see it having valuable kind of starting</p>
<p>point in terms of a thought experiment of it?</p>
<p>Is it useful?</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s more informative and interesting and maybe important, but it&rsquo;s not designed</p>
<p>to be useful for something else.</p>
<p>Okay, interesting, sure.</p>
<p>But is it philosophically interesting or is there some kind of implications of computer</p>
<p>science and physics?</p>
<p>I think not so much for computer science or physics per se.</p>
<p>Certainly it would be of interest in philosophy, I think also to say cosmology or physics in</p>
<p>as much as you&rsquo;re interested in the fundamental building blocks of the world and the rules</p>
<p>that govern it.</p>
<p>If we are in a simulation, there is then the possibility that say physics at the level</p>
<p>where the computer running the simulation could be different from the physics governing</p>
<p>phenomena in the simulation.</p>
<p>So I think it might be interesting from point of view of religion or just for kind of trying</p>
<p>to figure out what the heck is going on.</p>
<p>So we mentioned the simulation hypothesis so far.</p>
<p>There is also the simulation argument, which I tend to make a distinction.</p>
<p>So simulation hypothesis, we are living in a computer simulation.</p>
<p>Simulation argument, this argument that tries to show that one of three propositions is</p>
<p>true, one of which is the simulation hypothesis, but there are two alternatives in the original</p>
<p>simulation argument, which we can get to.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s go there.</p>
<p>By the way, confusing terms because people will, I think, probably naturally think simulation</p>
<p>argument equals simulation hypothesis, just terminology wise.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s go there.</p>
<p>So simulation hypothesis means that we are living in a simulations, the hypothesis that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re living in a simulation, simulation argument has these three complete possibilities that</p>
<p>cover all possibilities.</p>
<p>So what are they?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a disjunction.</p>
<p>It says at least one of these three is true, although it doesn&rsquo;t on its own tell us which</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>So the first one is that almost all civilizations that are current stage of technological development</p>
<p>go extinct before they reach technological maturity.</p>
<p>So there is some great filter that makes it so that basically none of the civilizations</p>
<p>throughout maybe a vast cosmos will ever get to realize the full potential of technological</p>
<p>development.</p>
<p>And this could be, theoretically speaking, this could be because most civilizations kill</p>
<p>themselves too eagerly or destroy themselves too eagerly, or it might be super difficult</p>
<p>to build a simulation.</p>
<p>So the span of time.</p>
<p>Theoretically it could be both.</p>
<p>Now I think it looks like we would technologically be able to get there in a time span that</p>
<p>is short compared to, say, the lifetime of planets and other sort of astronomical processes.</p>
<p>So your intuition is to build a simulation is not&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, so this is interesting concept of technological maturity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of an interesting concept to have other purposes as well.</p>
<p>We can see even based on our current limited understanding what some lower bound would</p>
<p>be on the capabilities that you could realize by just developing technologies that we already</p>
<p>see are possible.</p>
<p>So for example, one of my research fellows here, Eric Drexler, back in the 80s, studied</p>
<p>molecular manufacturing.</p>
<p>That is you could analyze using theoretical tools and computer modeling the performance</p>
<p>of various molecularly precise structures that we didn&rsquo;t then and still don&rsquo;t today</p>
<p>have the ability to actually fabricate.</p>
<p>But you could say that, well, if we could put these atoms together in this way, then</p>
<p>the system would be stable and it would rotate at this speed and have all these computational</p>
<p>characteristics.</p>
<p>And he also outlined some pathways that would enable us to get to this kind of molecularly</p>
<p>manufacturing in the fullness of time.</p>
<p>And you could do other studies we&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>You could look at the speed at which, say, it would be possible to colonize the galaxy</p>
<p>if you had mature technology.</p>
<p>We have an upper limit, which is the speed of light.</p>
<p>We have sort of a lower current limit, which is how fast current rockets go.</p>
<p>We know we can go faster than that by just making them bigger and have more fuel and</p>
<p>stuff.</p>
<p>We can then start to describe the technological affordances that would exist once a civilization</p>
<p>has had enough time to develop, at least those technologies we already know are possible.</p>
<p>Then maybe they would discover other new physical phenomena as well that we haven&rsquo;t realized</p>
<p>that would enable them to do even more.</p>
<p>But at least there is this kind of basic set of capabilities.</p>
<p>Can you just link on that, how do we jump from molecular manufacturing to deep space</p>
<p>exploration to mature technology?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the connection there?</p>
<p>Well, so these would be two examples of technological capability sets that we can have a high degree</p>
<p>of confidence are physically possible in our universe and that a civilization that was</p>
<p>allowed to continue to develop its science and technology would eventually attain.</p>
<p>You can intuit like, we can kind of see the set of breakthroughs that are likely to happen.</p>
<p>So you can see like, what did you call it, the technological set?</p>
<p>With computers, maybe it&rsquo;s easiest.</p>
<p>One is we could just imagine bigger computers using exactly the same parts that we have.</p>
<p>So you can kind of scale things that way, right?</p>
<p>But you could also make processors a bit faster.</p>
<p>If you had this molecular nanotechnology that Eric Drexler described, he characterized a</p>
<p>kind of crude computer built with these parts that would perform at a million times the</p>
<p>human brain while being significantly smaller, the size of a sugar cube.</p>
<p>And he made no claim that that&rsquo;s the optimum computing structure, like for all you know,</p>
<p>we could build faster computers that would be more efficient, but at least you could</p>
<p>do that if you had the ability to do things that were atomically precise.</p>
<p>I mean, so you can then combine these two.</p>
<p>You could have this kind of nanomolecular ability to build things atom by atom and then</p>
<p>say at this as a spatial scale that would be attainable through space colonizing technology.</p>
<p>You could then start, for example, to characterize a lower bound on the amount of computing power</p>
<p>that a technologically mature civilization would have.</p>
<p>If it could grab resources, you know, planets and so forth, and then use this molecular</p>
<p>nanotechnology to optimize them for computing, you&rsquo;d get a very, very high lower bound on</p>
<p>the amount of compute.</p>
<p>So sorry, just to define some terms, so technologically mature civilization is one that took that</p>
<p>piece of technology to its lower bound.</p>
<p>What is a technologically mature civilization?</p>
<p>So that means it&rsquo;s a stronger concept than we really need for the simulation hypothesis.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s interesting in its own right.</p>
<p>So it would be the idea that there is some stage of technological development where you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>basically maxed out, that you developed all those general purpose, widely useful technologies</p>
<p>that could be developed, or at least kind of come very close to the, you know, 99.9%</p>
<p>there or something.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an independent question.</p>
<p>You can think either that there is such a ceiling, or you might think it just goes,</p>
<p>the technology tree just goes on forever.</p>
<p>Where does your sense fall?</p>
<p>I would guess that there is a maximum that you would start to asymptote towards.</p>
<p>So new things won&rsquo;t keep springing up, new ceilings.</p>
<p>In terms of basic technological capabilities, I think that, yeah, there is like a finite</p>
<p>set of laws that can exist in this universe.</p>
<p>Moreover, I mean, I wouldn&rsquo;t be that surprised if we actually reached close to that level</p>
<p>fairly shortly after we have, say, machine superintelligence.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think it would take millions of years for a human originating civilization</p>
<p>to begin to do this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more likely to happen on historical timescales.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s an independent speculation from the simulation argument.</p>
<p>I mean, for the purpose of the simulation argument, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter whether</p>
<p>it goes indefinitely far up or whether there is a ceiling, as long as we know we can at</p>
<p>least get to a certain level.</p>
<p>And it also doesn&rsquo;t matter whether that&rsquo;s going to happen in 100 years or 5,000 years</p>
<p>or 50 million years.</p>
<p>Like the timescales really don&rsquo;t make any difference for this.</p>
<p>Can you look on that a little bit?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a big difference between 100 years and 10 million years.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t really not matter because you just said it doesn&rsquo;t matter if we jump scales</p>
<p>to beyond historical scales.</p>
<p>So we described that.</p>
<p>So for the simulation argument, sort of doesn&rsquo;t it matter that we if it takes 10 million years,</p>
<p>it gives us a lot more opportunity to destroy civilization in the meantime?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, so it would shift around the probabilities between these three alternatives.</p>
<p>That is, if we are very, very far away from being able to create these simulations, if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, say, billions of years into the future, then it&rsquo;s more likely that we will</p>
<p>fail ever to get there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more time for us to kind of go extinct along the way.</p>
<p>And so this is similarly for other civilizations.</p>
<p>So it is important to think about how hard it is to build a simulation.</p>
<p>In terms of figuring out which of the disjuncts.</p>
<p>But for the simulation argument itself, which is agnostic as to which of these three alternatives</p>
<p>is true.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you don&rsquo;t have to like the simulation argument would be true whether or not we thought</p>
<p>this could be done in 500 years or it would take 500 million years.</p>
<p>No, for sure.</p>
<p>The simulation argument stands.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure there might be some people who oppose it, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s very nice those three cases cover it.</p>
<p>But the fun part is at least not saying what the probabilities are, but kind of thinking</p>
<p>about kind of intuiting reasoning about what&rsquo;s more likely, what are the kind of things that</p>
<p>would make some of the arguments less and more so like.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s actually, I don&rsquo;t think we went through them.</p>
<p>So number one is we destroy ourselves before we ever create simulation.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of sad, but we have to think not just what might destroy us.</p>
<p>I mean, so there could be some whatever disaster, some meteor slamming the earth a few years</p>
<p>from now that could destroy us.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;d have to postulate in order for this first disjunct to be true that almost all</p>
<p>civilizations throughout the cosmos also failed to reach technological maturity.</p>
<p>And the underlying assumption there is that there is likely a very large number of other</p>
<p>intelligent civilizations.</p>
<p>Well, if there are, yeah, then they would virtually all have to succumb in the same</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>I mean, then that leads off another, I guess there are a lot of little digressions that</p>
<p>are interesting.</p>
<p>Definitely, let&rsquo;s go there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go there.</p>
<p>Keep dragging us back.</p>
<p>Well, there are these, there is a set of basic questions that always come up in conversations</p>
<p>with interesting people, like the Fermi paradox, like there&rsquo;s like, you could almost define</p>
<p>whether a person is interesting, whether at some point the question of the Fermi paradox</p>
<p>comes up, like, well, so for what it&rsquo;s worth, it looks to me that the universe is very big.</p>
<p>I mean, in fact, according to the most popular current cosmological theories, infinitely</p>
<p>big.</p>
<p>And so then it would follow pretty trivially that it would contain a lot of other civilizations,</p>
<p>in fact, infinitely many.</p>
<p>If you have some local stochasticity and infinitely many, it&rsquo;s like, you know, infinitely many</p>
<p>lumps of matter, one next to another, there&rsquo;s kind of random stuff in each one, then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to get all possible outcomes with probability one infinitely repeated.</p>
<p>So then certainly there would be a lot of extraterrestrials out there.</p>
<p>Even short of that, if the universe is very big, that might be a finite but large number.</p>
<p>If we were literally the only one, yeah, then of course, if we went extinct, then all of</p>
<p>civilizations at our current stage would have gone extinct before becoming technological</p>
<p>material.</p>
<p>So then it kind of becomes trivially true that a very high fraction of those went extinct.</p>
<p>But if we think there are many, I mean, it&rsquo;s interesting, because there are certain things</p>
<p>that possibly could kill us, like if you look at existential risks, and it might be a different,</p>
<p>like the best answer to what would be most likely to kill us might be a different answer</p>
<p>than the best answer to the question, if there is something that kills almost everyone, what</p>
<p>would that be?</p>
<p>Because that would have to be some risk factor that was kind of uniform overall possible</p>
<p>civilization.</p>
<p>So in this, for the sake of this argument, you have to think about not just us, but like</p>
<p>every civilization dies out before they create the simulation or something very close to</p>
<p>everybody.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s number two in the number two is the convergence hypothesis that is that maybe</p>
<p>like a lot of some of these civilizations do make it through to technological maturity,</p>
<p>but out of those who do get there, they all lose interest in creating these simulations.</p>
<p>So they just have the capability of doing it, but they choose not to.</p>
<p>Not just a few of them decide not to, but out of a million, maybe not even a single</p>
<p>one of them would do it.</p>
<p>And I think when you say lose interest, that sounds like unlikely because it&rsquo;s like they</p>
<p>get bored or whatever, but it could be so many possibilities within that.</p>
<p>I mean, losing interest could be, it could be anything from it being exceptionally difficult</p>
<p>to do to fundamentally changing the sort of the fabric of reality.</p>
<p>If you do it is ethical concerns, all those kinds of things could be exceptionally strong</p>
<p>pressures.</p>
<p>Well, certainly, I mean, yeah, ethical concerns.</p>
<p>I mean, not really too difficult to do.</p>
<p>I mean, in a sense, that&rsquo;s the first assumption that you get to technological maturity where</p>
<p>you would have the ability using only a tiny fraction of your resources to create many,</p>
<p>many simulations.</p>
<p>So it wouldn&rsquo;t be the case that they would need to spend half of their GDP forever in</p>
<p>order to create one simulation and they had this like difficult debate about whether they</p>
<p>should invest half of their GDP for this.</p>
<p>It would more be like, well, if any little fraction of the civilization feels like doing</p>
<p>this at any point during maybe their millions of years of existence, then that would be</p>
<p>millions of simulations.</p>
<p>But certainly, there could be many conceivable reasons for why there would be this convert,</p>
<p>many possible reasons for not running ancestor simulations or other computer simulations,</p>
<p>even if you could do so cheaply.</p>
<p>By the way, what&rsquo;s an ancestor simulation?</p>
<p>Well, that would be the type of computer simulation that would contain people like those we think</p>
<p>have lived on our planet in the past and like ourselves in terms of the types of experiences</p>
<p>they have and where those simulated people are conscious.</p>
<p>So like not just simulated in the same sense that a non player character would be simulated</p>
<p>in the current computer game where it&rsquo;s kind of has like an avatar body and then a very</p>
<p>simple mechanism that moves it forward or backwards.</p>
<p>But something where the simulated being has a brain, let&rsquo;s say that&rsquo;s simulated at a sufficient</p>
<p>level of granularity that it would have the same subjective experiences as we have.</p>
<p>So where does consciousness fit into this?</p>
<p>Do you think simulation, I guess there are different ways to think about how this can</p>
<p>be simulated, just like you&rsquo;re talking about now.</p>
<p>Do we have to simulate each brain within the larger simulation?</p>
<p>Is it enough to simulate just the brain, just the minds and not the simulation, not the</p>
<p>universe itself?</p>
<p>Like, is there a different ways to think about this?</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess there is a kind of premise in the simulation argument rolled in from philosophy</p>
<p>of mind that is that it would be possible to create a conscious mind in a computer.</p>
<p>And that what determines whether some system is conscious or not is not like whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>built from organic biological neurons, but maybe something like what the structure of</p>
<p>the computation is that it implements.</p>
<p>So we can discuss that if we want, but I think it would be more forward as far as my view</p>
<p>that it would be sufficient, say, if you had a computation that was identical to the computation</p>
<p>in the human brain down to the level of neurons.</p>
<p>So if you had a simulation with 100 billion neurons connected in the same way as the human</p>
<p>brain, and you then roll that forward with the same kind of synaptic weights and so forth,</p>
<p>so you actually had the same behavior coming out of this as a human with that brain would</p>
<p>have done, then I think that would be conscious.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s possible you could also generate consciousness without having that detailed</p>
<p>assimilation, there I&rsquo;m getting more uncertain exactly how much you could simplify or abstract</p>
<p>away.</p>
<p>Can you look on that?</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>I missed where you&rsquo;re placing consciousness in the second.</p>
<p>Well, so if you are a computationalist, do you think that what creates consciousness</p>
<p>is the implementation of a computation?</p>
<p>Some property, emergent property of the computation itself.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<p>Yeah, you could say that.</p>
<p>But then the question is, what&rsquo;s the class of computations such that when they are run,</p>
<p>consciousness emerges?</p>
<p>So if you just have something that adds one plus one plus one plus one, like a simple</p>
<p>computation, you think maybe that&rsquo;s not going to have any consciousness.</p>
<p>If on the other hand, the computation is one like our human brains are performing, where</p>
<p>as part of the computation, there is a global workspace, a sophisticated attention mechanism,</p>
<p>there is self representations of other cognitive processes and a whole lot of other things</p>
<p>that possibly would be conscious.</p>
<p>And in fact, if it&rsquo;s exactly like ours, I think definitely it would.</p>
<p>But exactly how much less than the full computation that the human brain is performing would be</p>
<p>required is a little bit, I think, of an open question.</p>
<p>He asked another interesting question as well, which is, would it be sufficient to just have</p>
<p>say the brain or would you need the environment in order to generate the same kind of experiences</p>
<p>that we have?</p>
<p>And there is a bunch of stuff we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, if you look at, say, current virtual reality environments, one thing that&rsquo;s clear</p>
<p>is that we don&rsquo;t have to simulate all details of them all the time in order for, say, the</p>
<p>human player to have the perception that there is a full reality and that you can have say</p>
<p>procedurally generated where you might only render a scene when it&rsquo;s actually within the</p>
<p>view of the player character.</p>
<p>And so similarly, if this environment that we perceive is simulated, it might be that</p>
<p>all of the parts that come into our view are rendered at any given time.</p>
<p>And a lot of aspects that never come into view, say the details of this microphone I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking into, exactly what each atom is doing at any given point in time, might not be part</p>
<p>of the simulation, only a more coarse grained representation.</p>
<p>So that to me is actually from an engineering perspective, why the simulation hypothesis</p>
<p>is really interesting to think about is how difficult is it to fake sort of in a virtual</p>
<p>reality context, I don&rsquo;t know if fake is the right word, but to construct a reality that</p>
<p>is sufficiently real to us to be immersive in the way that the physical world is.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s actually probably an answerable question of psychology, of computer science,</p>
<p>of how, where&rsquo;s the line where it becomes so immersive that you don&rsquo;t want to leave</p>
<p>that world?</p>
<p>Yeah, or that you don&rsquo;t realize while you&rsquo;re in it that it is a virtual world.</p>
<p>Yeah, those are two actually questions, yours is the more sort of the good question about</p>
<p>the realism, but mine, from my perspective, what&rsquo;s interesting is it doesn&rsquo;t have to be</p>
<p>real, but how can we construct a world that we wouldn&rsquo;t want to leave?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think that might be too low a bar, I mean, if you think, say when people</p>
<p>first had pong or something like that, I&rsquo;m sure there were people who wanted to keep</p>
<p>playing it for a long time because it was fun and they wanted to be in this little world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure we would say it&rsquo;s immersive, I mean, I guess in some sense it is, but like</p>
<p>an absorbing activity doesn&rsquo;t even have to be.</p>
<p>But they left that world though, that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>So like, I think that bar is deceivingly high.</p>
<p>So they eventually left, so you can play pong or Starcraft or whatever more sophisticated</p>
<p>games for hours, for months, you know, while the work has to be in a big addiction, but</p>
<p>eventually they escaped that.</p>
<p>So you mean when it&rsquo;s absorbing enough that you would spend your entire, you would choose</p>
<p>to spend your entire life in there.</p>
<p>And then thereby changing the concept of what reality is, because your reality becomes the</p>
<p>game.</p>
<p>Not because you&rsquo;re fooled, but because you&rsquo;ve made that choice.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it made, different people might have different preferences regarding that.</p>
<p>Some might, even if you had any perfect virtual reality, might still prefer not to spend the</p>
<p>rest of their lives there.</p>
<p>I mean, in philosophy, there&rsquo;s this experience machine, thought experiment.</p>
<p>Have you come across this?</p>
<p>So Robert Nozick had this thought experiment where you imagine some crazy super duper neuroscientist</p>
<p>of the future have created a machine that could give you any experience you want if</p>
<p>you step in there.</p>
<p>And for the rest of your life, you can kind of pre programmed it in different ways.</p>
<p>So your fun dreams could come true, you could, whatever you dream, you want to be a great</p>
<p>artist, a great lover, like have a wonderful life, all of these things.</p>
<p>If you step into the experience machine will be your experiences, constantly happy.</p>
<p>But you would kind of disconnect from the rest of reality and you would float there</p>
<p>in a tank.</p>
<p>And so Nozick thought that most people would choose not to enter the experience machine.</p>
<p>I mean, many might want to go there for a holiday, but they wouldn&rsquo;t want to have to</p>
<p>check out of existence permanently.</p>
<p>And so he thought that was an argument against certain views of value according to what we</p>
<p>value is a function of what we experience.</p>
<p>Because in the experience machine, you could have any experience you want, and yet many</p>
<p>people would think that would not be much value.</p>
<p>So therefore, what we value depends on other things than what we experience.</p>
<p>So okay, can you can you take that argument further?</p>
<p>What about the fact that maybe what we value is the up and down of life?</p>
<p>So you could have up and downs in the experience machine, right?</p>
<p>But what can&rsquo;t you have in the experience machine?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, that then becomes an interesting question to explore.</p>
<p>But for example, real connection with other people, if the experience machine is a solo</p>
<p>machine where it&rsquo;s only you, like that&rsquo;s something you wouldn&rsquo;t have there.</p>
<p>You would have this subjective experience that would be like fake people.</p>
<p>But when if you gave somebody flowers, there wouldn&rsquo;t be anybody there who actually got</p>
<p>happy.</p>
<p>It would just be a little simulation of somebody smiling.</p>
<p>But the simulation would not be the kind of simulation I&rsquo;m talking about in the simulation</p>
<p>argument where the simulated creature is conscious, it would just be a kind of smiley face that</p>
<p>would look perfectly real to you.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re now drawing a distinction between appear to be perfectly real and actually being</p>
<p>real.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Um, so that could be one thing, I mean, like a big impact on history, maybe is also something</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t have if you check into this experience machine.</p>
<p>So some people might actually feel the life I want to have for me is one where I have</p>
<p>a big positive impact on history unfolds.</p>
<p>So you could kind of explore these different possible explanations for why it is you wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to go into the experience machine if that&rsquo;s, if that&rsquo;s what you feel.</p>
<p>And one interesting observation regarding this Nozick thought experiment and the conclusions</p>
<p>he wanted to draw from it is how much is a kind of a status quo effect.</p>
<p>So a lot of people might not want to get this on current reality to plug into this dream</p>
<p>machine.</p>
<p>But if they instead were told, well, what you&rsquo;ve experienced up to this point was a</p>
<p>dream now, do you want to disconnect from this and enter the real world when you have</p>
<p>no idea maybe what the real world is, or maybe you could say, well, you&rsquo;re actually a farmer</p>
<p>in Peru, growing, you know, peanuts, and you could live for the rest of your life in this</p>
<p>way, or would you want to continue your dream life as Alex Friedman going around the world</p>
<p>making podcasts and doing research.</p>
<p>So if the status quo was that they were actually in the experience machine, I think a lot of</p>
<p>people might then prefer to live the life that they are familiar with rather than sort</p>
<p>of bail out into.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s interesting, the change itself, the leap, yeah, so it might not be so much</p>
<p>the reality itself that we&rsquo;re after.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s more that we are maybe involved in certain projects and relationships.</p>
<p>And we have, you know, a self identity and these things that our values are kind of connected</p>
<p>with carrying that forward.</p>
<p>And then whether it&rsquo;s inside a tank or outside a tank in Peru, or whether inside a computer</p>
<p>outside a computer, that&rsquo;s kind of less important to what we ultimately care about.</p>
<p>Yeah, but still, so just to linger on it, it is interesting.</p>
<p>I find maybe people are different, but I find myself quite willing to take the leap to the</p>
<p>farmer in Peru, especially as the virtual reality system become more realistic.</p>
<p>I find that possibility and I think more people would take that leap.</p>
<p>But so in this thought experiment, just to make sure we are understanding, so in this</p>
<p>case, the farmer in Peru would not be a virtual reality, that would be the real, your life,</p>
<p>like before this whole experience machine started.</p>
<p>Well, I kind of assumed from that description, you&rsquo;re being very specific, but that kind</p>
<p>of idea just like washes away the concept of what&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still a little hesitant about your kind of distinction between real and illusion.</p>
<p>Because when you can have an illusion that feels, I mean, that looks real, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how you can definitively say something is real or not, like what&rsquo;s a good way to prove</p>
<p>that something is real in that context?</p>
<p>Well, so I guess in this case, it&rsquo;s more a stipulation.</p>
<p>In one case, you&rsquo;re floating in a tank with these wires by the super duper neuroscientists</p>
<p>plugging into your head, giving you like Friedman experiences.</p>
<p>In the other, you&rsquo;re actually tilling the soil in Peru, growing peanuts, and then those</p>
<p>peanuts are being eaten by other people all around the world who buy the exports.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s two different possible situations in the one and the same real world that you could</p>
<p>choose to occupy.</p>
<p>But just to be clear, when you&rsquo;re in a vat with wires and the neuroscientists, you can</p>
<p>still go farming in Peru, right?</p>
<p>No, well, if you wanted to, you could have the experience of farming in Peru, but there</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t actually be any peanuts grown.</p>
<p>But what makes a peanut, so a peanut could be grown and you could feed things with that</p>
<p>peanut and why can&rsquo;t all of that be done in a simulation?</p>
<p>I hope, first of all, that they actually have peanut farms in Peru, I guess we&rsquo;ll get a</p>
<p>lot of comments otherwise from Angrit.</p>
<p>I was way up to the point when you started talking about Peru peanuts, that&rsquo;s when I</p>
<p>realized you&rsquo;re relying out of these.</p>
<p>In that climate.</p>
<p>No, I mean, I think, I mean, in the simulation, I think there is a sense, the important sense</p>
<p>in which it would all be real.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is a distinction between inside the simulation and outside the simulation.</p>
<p>Or in the case of Nozick&rsquo;s thought experiment, whether you&rsquo;re in the vat or outside the vat,</p>
<p>and some of those differences may or may not be important.</p>
<p>I mean, that comes down to your values and preferences.</p>
<p>So if the, if the experience machine only gives you the experience of growing peanuts,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re the only one in the experience machines.</p>
<p>No, but there&rsquo;s other, you can, within the experience machine, others can plug in.</p>
<p>Well, there are versions of the experience machine.</p>
<p>So in fact, you might want to have, distinguish different thought experiments, different versions</p>
<p>of it.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>So in, like in the original thought experiment, maybe it&rsquo;s only you, right?</p>
<p>And you think, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to go in there.</p>
<p>Well, that tells you something interesting about what you value and what you care about.</p>
<p>Then you could say, well, what if you add the fact that there would be other people</p>
<p>in there and you would interact with them?</p>
<p>Well, it starts to make it more attractive, right?</p>
<p>Then you could add in, well, what if you could also have important longterm effects on human</p>
<p>history and the world, and you could actually do something useful, even though you were</p>
<p>in there.</p>
<p>That makes it maybe even more attractive.</p>
<p>Like you could actually have a life that had a purpose and consequences.</p>
<p>And so as you sort of add more into it, it becomes more similar to the baseline reality</p>
<p>that you were comparing it to.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I just think inside the experience machine and without taking those steps you</p>
<p>just mentioned, you still have an impact on longterm history of the creatures that live</p>
<p>inside that, of the quote unquote fake creatures that live inside that experience machine.</p>
<p>And that, like at a certain point, you know, if there&rsquo;s a person waiting for you inside</p>
<p>that experience machine, maybe your newly found wife and she dies, she has fear, she</p>
<p>has hopes, and she exists in that machine when you plug out, when you unplug yourself</p>
<p>and plug back in, she&rsquo;s still there going on about her life.</p>
<p>Well, in that case, yeah, she starts to have more of an independent existence.</p>
<p>Independent existence.</p>
<p>But it depends, I think, on how she&rsquo;s implemented in the experience machine.</p>
<p>Take one limit case where all she is is a static picture on the wall, a photograph.</p>
<p>So you think, well, I can look at her, right?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no&hellip;</p>
<p>Then you think, well, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter much what happens to that, any more than a</p>
<p>normal photograph if you tear it up, right?</p>
<p>It means you can&rsquo;t see it anymore, but you haven&rsquo;t harmed the person whose picture you</p>
<p>tore up.</p>
<p>But if she&rsquo;s actually implemented, say, at a neural level of detail so that she&rsquo;s a fully</p>
<p>realized digital mind with the same behavioral repertoire as you have, then very plausibly</p>
<p>she would be a conscious person like you are.</p>
<p>And then what you do in this experience machine would have real consequences for how this</p>
<p>other mind felt.</p>
<p>So you have to specify which of these experience machines you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not entirely obvious that it would be possible to have an experience machine</p>
<p>that gave you a normal set of human experiences, which include experiences of interacting with</p>
<p>other people, without that also generating consciousnesses corresponding to those other</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>That is, if you create another entity that you perceive and interact with, that to you</p>
<p>looks entirely realistic.</p>
<p>Not just when you say hello, they say hello back, but you have a rich interaction, many</p>
<p>days, deep conversations.</p>
<p>It might be that the only possible way of implementing that would be one that also has</p>
<p>a side effect, instantiated this other person in enough detail that you would have a second</p>
<p>consciousness there.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s to some extent an open question.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible to fake consciousness and fake intelligence?</p>
<p>Well, it might be.</p>
<p>I mean, I think you can certainly fake, if you have a very limited interaction with somebody,</p>
<p>you could certainly fake that.</p>
<p>If all you have to go on is somebody said hello to you, that&rsquo;s not enough for you to</p>
<p>tell whether that was a real person there, or a prerecorded message, or a very superficial</p>
<p>simulation that has no consciousness, because that&rsquo;s something easy to fake.</p>
<p>We could already fake it, now you can record a voice recording.</p>
<p>But if you have a richer set of interactions where you&rsquo;re allowed to ask open ended questions</p>
<p>and probe from different angles, you couldn&rsquo;t give canned answer to all of the possible</p>
<p>ways that you could probe it, then it starts to become more plausible that the only way</p>
<p>to realize this thing in such a way that you would get the right answer from any which</p>
<p>angle you probed it, would be a way of instantiating it, where you also instantiated a conscious</p>
<p>mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m with you on the intelligence part, but is there something about me that says</p>
<p>consciousness is easier to fake?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve recently gotten my hands on a lot of rubas, don&rsquo;t ask me why or how.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve made them, there&rsquo;s just a nice robotic mobile platform for experiments.</p>
<p>And I made them scream and or moan in pain, so on, just to see when they&rsquo;re responding</p>
<p>to me.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just a sort of psychological experiment on myself.</p>
<p>And I think they appear conscious to me pretty quickly.</p>
<p>To me, at least my brain can be tricked quite easily.</p>
<p>I said if I introspect, it&rsquo;s harder for me to be tricked that something is intelligent.</p>
<p>So I just have this feeling that inside this experience machine, just saying that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>conscious and having certain qualities of the interaction, like being able to suffer,</p>
<p>like being able to hurt, like being able to wander about the essence of your own existence,</p>
<p>not actually, I mean, creating the illusion that you&rsquo;re wandering about it is enough to</p>
<p>create the illusion of consciousness.</p>
<p>And because of that, create a really immersive experience to where you feel like that is</p>
<p>the real world.</p>
<p>So you think there&rsquo;s a big gap between appearing conscious and being conscious?</p>
<p>Or is it that you think it&rsquo;s very easy to be conscious?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not actually sure what it means to be conscious.</p>
<p>All I&rsquo;m saying is the illusion of consciousness is enough to create a social interaction that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>as good as if the thing was conscious, meaning I&rsquo;m making it about myself.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess there are a few different things.</p>
<p>One is how good the interaction is, which might, I mean, if you don&rsquo;t really care about</p>
<p>like probing hard for whether the thing is conscious, maybe it would be a satisfactory</p>
<p>interaction, whether or not you really thought it was conscious.</p>
<p>Now, if you really care about it being conscious in like inside this experience machine, how</p>
<p>easy would it be to fake it?</p>
<p>And you say, it sounds fairly easy, but then the question is, would that also mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very easy to instantiate consciousness?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s much more widely spread in the world and we have thought it doesn&rsquo;t require a big</p>
<p>human brain with a hundred billion neurons, all you need is some system that exhibits</p>
<p>basic intentionality and can respond and you already have consciousness.</p>
<p>Like in that case, I guess you still have a close coupling.</p>
<p>I guess that case would be where they can come apart, where you could create the appearance</p>
<p>of there being a conscious mind with actually not being another conscious mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m somewhat agnostic exactly where these lines go.</p>
<p>I think one observation that makes it plausible that you could have very realistic appearances</p>
<p>relatively simply, which also is relevant for the simulation argument and in terms of</p>
<p>thinking about how realistic would a virtual reality model have to be in order for the</p>
<p>simulated creature not to notice that anything was awry.</p>
<p>Well, just think of our own humble brains during the wee hours of the night when we</p>
<p>are dreaming.</p>
<p>Many times, well, dreams are very immersive, but often you also don&rsquo;t realize that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in a dream.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s produced by simple primitive three pound lumps of neural matter effortlessly.</p>
<p>So if a simple brain like this can create the virtual reality that seems pretty real</p>
<p>to us, then how much easier would it be for a super intelligent civilization with planetary</p>
<p>sized computers optimized over the eons to create a realistic environment for you to</p>
<p>interact with?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>By the way, behind that intuition is that our brain is not that impressive relative</p>
<p>to the possibilities of what technology could bring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also possible that the brain is the epitome, is the ceiling.</p>
<p>How is that possible?</p>
<p>Meaning like this is the smartest possible thing that the universe could create.</p>
<p>So that seems unlikely to me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, for some of these reasons we alluded to earlier in terms of designs we already</p>
<p>have for computers that would be faster by many orders of magnitude than the human brain.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We can see that the constraints, the cognitive constraints in themselves is what enables</p>
<p>the intelligence.</p>
<p>So the more powerful you make the computer, the less likely it is to become super intelligent.</p>
<p>This is where I say dumb things to push back on that statement.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I thought that we might.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I mean, so there are different dimensions of intelligence.</p>
<p>A simple one is just speed.</p>
<p>Like if you can solve the same challenge faster in some sense, you&rsquo;re like smarter.</p>
<p>So there I think we have very strong evidence for thinking that you could have a computer</p>
<p>in this universe that would be much faster than the human brain and therefore have speed</p>
<p>super intelligence, like be completely superior, maybe a million times faster.</p>
<p>Then maybe there are other ways in which you could be smarter as well, maybe more qualitative</p>
<p>ways, right?</p>
<p>And the concepts are a little bit less clear cut.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s harder to make a very crisp, neat, firmly logical argument for why that could</p>
<p>be qualitative super intelligence as opposed to just things that were faster.</p>
<p>Although I still think it&rsquo;s very plausible and for various reasons that are less than</p>
<p>watertight arguments.</p>
<p>But when you can sort of, for example, if you look at animals and even within humans,</p>
<p>like there seems to be like Einstein versus random person, like it&rsquo;s not just that Einstein</p>
<p>was a little bit faster, but like how long would it take a normal person to invent general</p>
<p>relativity is like, it&rsquo;s not 20% longer than it took Einstein or something like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know whether they would do it at all or it would take millions of</p>
<p>years or some totally bizarre.</p>
<p>But your intuition is that the compute size will get you go increasing the size of the</p>
<p>computer and the speed of the computer might create some much more powerful levels of intelligence</p>
<p>that would enable some of the things we&rsquo;ve been talking about with like the simulation,</p>
<p>being able to simulate an ultra realistic environment, ultra realistic perception of</p>
<p>reality.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, strictly speaking, it would not be necessary to have super intelligence in order</p>
<p>to have say the technology to make these simulations, ancestor simulations or other kinds of simulations.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I think if we are in a simulation, it would most likely be one</p>
<p>built by a civilization that had super intelligence.</p>
<p>It certainly would help a lot.</p>
<p>I mean, you could build more efficient larger scale structures if you had super intelligence.</p>
<p>I also think that if you had the technology to build these simulations, that&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>very advanced technology.</p>
<p>It seems kind of easier to get the technology to super intelligence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d expect by the time they could make these fully realistic simulations of human history</p>
<p>with human brains in there, like before that they got to that stage, they would have figured</p>
<p>out how to create machine super intelligence or maybe biological enhancements of their</p>
<p>own brains if there were biological creatures to start with.</p>
<p>So we talked about the three parts of the simulation argument.</p>
<p>One, we destroy ourselves before we ever create the simulation.</p>
<p>Two, we somehow, everybody somehow loses interest in creating the simulation.</p>
<p>Three, we&rsquo;re living in a simulation.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve kind of, I don&rsquo;t know if your thinking has evolved on this point, but you kind of</p>
<p>said that we know so little that these three cases might as well be equally probable.</p>
<p>So probabilistically speaking, where do you stand on this?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I don&rsquo;t think equal necessarily would be the most supported probability assignment.</p>
<p>So how would you, without assigning actual numbers, what&rsquo;s more or less likely in your</p>
<p>view?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I&rsquo;ve historically tended to punt on the question of like between these</p>
<p>three.</p>
<p>So maybe you ask me another way is which kind of things would make each of these more or</p>
<p>less likely?</p>
<p>What kind of intuition?</p>
<p>Certainly in general terms, if you think anything that say increases or reduces the probability</p>
<p>of one of these, we tend to slosh probability around on the other.</p>
<p>So if one becomes less probable, like the other would have to, cause it&rsquo;s got to add</p>
<p>up to one.</p>
<p>So if we consider the first hypothesis, the first alternative that there&rsquo;s this filter</p>
<p>that makes it so that virtually no civilization reaches technological maturity, in particular</p>
<p>our own civilization, if that&rsquo;s true, then it&rsquo;s like very unlikely that we would reach</p>
<p>technological maturity because if almost no civilization at our stage does it, then it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unlikely that we do it.</p>
<p>So hence&hellip;</p>
<p>Sorry, can you linger on that for a second?</p>
<p>Well, so if it&rsquo;s the case that almost all civilizations at our current stage of technological</p>
<p>development failed to reach maturity, that would give us very strong reason for thinking</p>
<p>we will fail to reach technological maturity.</p>
<p>Oh, and also sort of the flip side of that is the fact that we&rsquo;ve reached it means that</p>
<p>many other civilizations have reached this point.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that means if we get closer and closer to actually reaching technological maturity,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s less and less distance left where we could go extinct before we are there, and</p>
<p>therefore the probability that we will reach increases as we get closer, and that would</p>
<p>make it less likely to be true that almost all civilizations at our current stage failed</p>
<p>to get there.</p>
<p>Like we would have this&hellip;</p>
<p>The one case we had started ourselves would be very close to getting there, that would</p>
<p>be strong evidence that it&rsquo;s not so hard to get to technological maturity.</p>
<p>So to the extent that we feel we are moving nearer to technological maturity, that would</p>
<p>tend to reduce the probability of the first alternative and increase the probability of</p>
<p>the other two.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t need to be a monotonic change.</p>
<p>Like if every once in a while some new threat comes into view, some bad new thing you could</p>
<p>do with some novel technology, for example, that could change our probabilities in the</p>
<p>other direction.</p>
<p>But that technology, again, you have to think about as that technology has to be able to</p>
<p>equally in an even way affect every civilization out there.</p>
<p>Yeah, pretty much.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s strictly speaking, it&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>I mean, that could be two different existential risks and every civilization, you know, one</p>
<p>or the other, like, but none of them kills more than 50%.</p>
<p>But incidentally, so in some of my work, I mean, on machine superintelligence, like pointed</p>
<p>to some existential risks related to sort of super intelligent AI and how we must make</p>
<p>sure, you know, to handle that wisely and carefully.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the right kind of existential catastrophe to make the first alternative true though.</p>
<p>Like it might be bad for us if the future lost a lot of value as a result of it being</p>
<p>shaped by some process that optimized for some completely nonhuman value.</p>
<p>But even if we got killed by machine superintelligence, that machine superintelligence might still</p>
<p>attain technological maturity.</p>
<p>Oh, I see, so you&rsquo;re not human exclusive.</p>
<p>This could be any intelligent species that achieves, like it&rsquo;s all about the technological</p>
<p>maturity.</p>
<p>But the humans have to attain it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So like superintelligence could replace us and that&rsquo;s just as well for the simulation</p>
<p>argument.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it could interact with the second hypothesis by alternative.</p>
<p>Like if the thing that replaced us was either more likely or less likely than we would be</p>
<p>to have an interest in creating ancestor simulations, you know, that could affect probabilities.</p>
<p>But yeah, to a first order, like if we all just die, then yeah, we won&rsquo;t produce any</p>
<p>simulations because we are dead.</p>
<p>But if we all die and get replaced by some other intelligent thing that then gets to</p>
<p>technological maturity, the question remains, of course, if not that thing, then use some</p>
<p>of its resources to do this stuff.</p>
<p>So can you reason about this stuff, given how little we know about the universe?</p>
<p>Is it reasonable to reason about these probabilities?</p>
<p>So like how little, well, maybe you can disagree, but to me, it&rsquo;s not trivial to figure out</p>
<p>how difficult it is to build a simulation.</p>
<p>We kind of talked about it a little bit.</p>
<p>We also don&rsquo;t know, like as we try to start building it, like start creating virtual worlds</p>
<p>and so on, how that changes the fabric of society.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s all these things along the way that can fundamentally change just so many</p>
<p>aspects of our society about our existence that we don&rsquo;t know anything about, like the</p>
<p>kind of things we might discover when we understand to a greater degree the fundamental, the physics,</p>
<p>like the theory, if we have a breakthrough, have a theory and everything, how that changes</p>
<p>stuff, how that changes deep space exploration and so on.</p>
<p>Like, is it still possible to reason about probabilities given how little we know?</p>
<p>Yes, I think there will be a large residual of uncertainty that we&rsquo;ll just have to acknowledge.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s true for most of these big picture questions that we might wonder</p>
<p>about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just we are small, short lived, small brained, cognitively very limited humans with</p>
<p>little evidence.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s amazing we can figure out as much as we can really about the cosmos.</p>
<p>But okay, so there&rsquo;s this cognitive trick that seems to happen when I look at the simulation</p>
<p>argument, which for me, it seems like case one and two feel unlikely.</p>
<p>I want to say feel unlikely as opposed to sort of like, it&rsquo;s not like I have too much</p>
<p>scientific evidence to say that either one or two are not true.</p>
<p>It just seems unlikely that every single civilization destroys itself.</p>
<p>And it seems like feels unlikely that the civilizations lose interest.</p>
<p>So naturally, without necessarily explicitly doing it, but the simulation argument basically</p>
<p>says it&rsquo;s very likely we&rsquo;re living in a simulation.</p>
<p>To me, my mind naturally goes there.</p>
<p>I think the mind goes there for a lot of people.</p>
<p>Is that the incorrect place for it to go?</p>
<p>Well, not necessarily.</p>
<p>I think the second alternative, which has to do with the motivations and interests of</p>
<p>technological and material civilizations, I think there is much we don&rsquo;t understand about</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>Can you talk about that a little bit?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>I mean, this is a question that pops up when you when you build an AGI system or build</p>
<p>a general intelligence.</p>
<p>How does that change our motivations?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;ll fundamentally transform our motivations?</p>
<p>Well, it doesn&rsquo;t seem that implausible that once you take this leap to to technological</p>
<p>maturity, I mean, I think like it involves creating machine super intelligence, possibly</p>
<p>that would be sort of on the path for basically all civilizations, maybe before they are able</p>
<p>to create large numbers of ancestry simulations, they would that that possibly could be one</p>
<p>of these things that quite radically changes the orientation of what a civilization is,</p>
<p>in fact, optimizing for.</p>
<p>There are other things as well.</p>
<p>So at the moment, we have not perfect control over our own being our own mental states,</p>
<p>our own experiences are not under our direct control.</p>
<p>So for example, if if you want to experience a pleasure and happiness, you might have to</p>
<p>do a whole host of things in the external world to try to get into the stage into the</p>
<p>mental state where you experience pleasure, like some people get some pleasure from eating</p>
<p>great food.</p>
<p>Well, they can just turn that on, they have to kind of actually go to a nice restaurant</p>
<p>and then they have to make money.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like all this kind of activity that maybe arises from the fact that we are</p>
<p>trying to ultimately produce mental states.</p>
<p>But the only way to do that is by a whole host of complicated activities in the external</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>Now, at some level of technological development, I think we&rsquo;ll become auto potent in the sense</p>
<p>of gaining direct ability to choose our own internal configuration, and enough knowledge</p>
<p>and insight to be able to actually do that in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>So then it could turn out that there are a lot of instrumental goals that would drop</p>
<p>out of the picture and be replaced by other instrumental goals, because we could now serve</p>
<p>some of these final goals in more direct ways.</p>
<p>And who knows how all of that shakes out after civilizations reflect on that and converge</p>
<p>on different attractors and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And that could be new instrumental considerations that come into view as well, that we are just</p>
<p>oblivious to, that would maybe have a strong shaping effect on actions, like very strong</p>
<p>reasons to do something or not to do something, then we just don&rsquo;t realize they are there</p>
<p>because we are so dumb, bumbling through the universe.</p>
<p>But if almost inevitably en route to attaining the ability to create many ancestors simulations,</p>
<p>you do have this cognitive enhancement, or advice from super intelligences or yourself,</p>
<p>then maybe there&rsquo;s like this additional set of considerations coming into view and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>obvious that the thing that makes sense is to do X, whereas right now it seems you could</p>
<p>X, Y or Z and different people will do different things and we are kind of random in that sense.</p>
<p>Because at this time, with our limited technology, the impact of our decisions is minor.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s starting to change in some ways.</p>
<p>But‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not sure how it follows that the impact of our decisions is minor.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s starting to change.</p>
<p>I mean, I suppose 100 years ago it was minor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s starting to‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Well, it depends on how you view it.</p>
<p>What people did 100 years ago still have effects on the world today.</p>
<p>Oh, I see.</p>
<p>As a civilization in the togetherness.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it might be that the greatest impact of individuals is not at technological maturity</p>
<p>or very far down.</p>
<p>It might be earlier on when there are different tracks, civilization could go down.</p>
<p>Maybe the population is smaller, things still haven&rsquo;t settled out.</p>
<p>If you count indirect effects, those could be bigger than the direct effects that people</p>
<p>have later on.</p>
<p>So part three of the argument says that‚Ä¶</p>
<p>So that leads us to a place where eventually somebody creates a simulation.</p>
<p>I think you had a conversation with Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s some aspect here where you got stuck a little bit.</p>
<p>How does that lead to we&rsquo;re likely living in a simulation?</p>
<p>So this kind of probability argument, if somebody eventually creates a simulation, why does</p>
<p>that mean that we&rsquo;re now in a simulation?</p>
<p>What you get to if you accept alternative three first is there would be more simulated</p>
<p>people with our kinds of experiences than non simulated ones.</p>
<p>Like if you look at the world as a whole, by the end of time as it were, you just count</p>
<p>it up.</p>
<p>That would be more simulated ones than non simulated ones.</p>
<p>Then there is an extra step to get from that.</p>
<p>If you assume that, suppose for the sake of the argument, that that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>How do you get from that to the statement we are probably in a simulation?</p>
<p>So here you&rsquo;re introducing an indexical statement like it&rsquo;s that this person right now is in</p>
<p>a simulation.</p>
<p>There are all these other people that are in simulations and some that are not in the</p>
<p>simulation.</p>
<p>But what probability should you have that you yourself is one of the simulated ones</p>
<p>in that setup?</p>
<p>So I call it the bland principle of indifference, which is that in cases like this, when you</p>
<p>have two sets of observers, one of which is much larger than the other and you can&rsquo;t from</p>
<p>any internal evidence you have, tell which set you belong to, you should assign a probability</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s proportional to the size of these sets.</p>
<p>So that if there are 10 times more simulated people with your kinds of experiences, you</p>
<p>would be 10 times more likely to be one of those.</p>
<p>Is that as intuitive as it sounds?</p>
<p>I mean, that seems kind of, if you don&rsquo;t have enough information, you should rationally</p>
<p>just assign the same probability as the size of the set.</p>
<p>It seems pretty plausible to me.</p>
<p>Where are the holes in this?</p>
<p>Is it at the very beginning, the assumption that everything stretches, you have infinite</p>
<p>time essentially?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need infinite time.</p>
<p>You just need, how long does the time take?</p>
<p>However long it takes, I guess, for a universe to produce an intelligent civilization that</p>
<p>attains the technology to run some ancestry simulations.</p>
<p>When the first simulation is created, that stretch of time, just a little longer than</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll all start creating simulations.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, there might be a difference.</p>
<p>If you think of there being a lot of different planets and some subset of them have life</p>
<p>and then some subset of those get to intelligent life and some of those maybe eventually start</p>
<p>creating simulations, they might get started at quite different times.</p>
<p>Maybe on some planet, it takes a billion years longer before you get monkeys or before you</p>
<p>get even bacteria than on another planet.</p>
<p>This might happen at different cosmological epochs.</p>
<p>Is there a connection here to the doomsday argument and that sampling there?</p>
<p>Yeah, there is a connection in that they both involve an application of anthropic reasoning</p>
<p>that is reasoning about these kind of indexical propositions.</p>
<p>But the assumption you need in the case of the simulation argument is much weaker than</p>
<p>the assumption you need to make the doomsday argument go through.</p>
<p>What is the doomsday argument and maybe you can speak to the anthropic reasoning in more</p>
<p>general.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a big and interesting topic in its own right, anthropics, but the doomsday</p>
<p>argument is this really first discovered by Brandon Carter, who was a theoretical physicist</p>
<p>and then developed by philosopher John Leslie.</p>
<p>I think it might have been discovered initially in the 70s or 80s and Leslie wrote this book,</p>
<p>I think in 96.</p>
<p>And there are some other versions as well by Richard Gott, who&rsquo;s a physicist, but let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>focus on the Carter Leslie version where it&rsquo;s an argument that we have systematically underestimated</p>
<p>the probability that humanity will go extinct soon.</p>
<p>Now I should say most people probably think at the end of the day there is something wrong</p>
<p>with this doomsday argument that it doesn&rsquo;t really hold.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s something wrong with it, but it&rsquo;s proved hard to say exactly what is</p>
<p>wrong with it and different people have different accounts.</p>
<p>My own view is it seems inconclusive, but I can say what the argument is.</p>
<p>Yeah, that would be good.</p>
<p>So maybe it&rsquo;s easiest to explain via an analogy to sampling from urns.</p>
<p>So imagine you have two urns in front of you and they have balls in them that have numbers.</p>
<p>The two urns look the same, but inside one there are 10 balls.</p>
<p>Ball number one, two, three, up to ball number 10.</p>
<p>And then in the other urn you have a million balls numbered one to a million and somebody</p>
<p>puts one of these urns in front of you and asks you to guess what&rsquo;s the chance it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>10 ball urn and you say, well, 50, 50, I can&rsquo;t tell which urn it is.</p>
<p>But then you&rsquo;re allowed to reach in and pick a ball at random from the urn and that&rsquo;s suppose</p>
<p>you find that it&rsquo;s ball number seven.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s strong evidence for the 10 ball hypothesis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot more likely that you would get such a low numbered ball if there are only</p>
<p>10 balls in the urn, like it&rsquo;s in fact 10% done, right?</p>
<p>Then if there are a million balls, it would be very unlikely you would get number seven.</p>
<p>So you perform a Bayesian update and if your prior was 50, 50 that it was the 10 ball urn,</p>
<p>you become virtually certain after finding the random sample was seven that it&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>has 10 balls in it.</p>
<p>So in the case of the urns, this is uncontroversial, just elementary probability theory.</p>
<p>The Doomsday Argument says that you should reason in a similar way with respect to different</p>
<p>hypotheses about how many balls there will be in the urn of humanity as it were, how</p>
<p>many humans there will ever have been by the time we go extinct.</p>
<p>So to simplify, let&rsquo;s suppose we only consider two hypotheses, either maybe 200 billion humans</p>
<p>in total or 200 trillion humans in total.</p>
<p>You could fill in more hypotheses, but it doesn&rsquo;t change the principle here.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s easiest to see if we just consider these two.</p>
<p>So you start with some prior based on ordinary empirical ideas about threats to civilization</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>And maybe you say it&rsquo;s a 5% chance that we will go extinct by the time there will have</p>
<p>been 200 billion only, you&rsquo;re kind of optimistic, let&rsquo;s say, you think probably we&rsquo;ll make it</p>
<p>through, colonize the universe.</p>
<p>But then, according to this Doomsday Argument, you should take off your own birth rank as</p>
<p>a random sample.</p>
<p>So your birth rank is your sequence in the position of all humans that have ever existed.</p>
<p>It turns out you&rsquo;re about a human number of 100 billion, you know, give or take.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, roughly how many people have been born before you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating, because I probably, we each have a number.</p>
<p>We would each have a number in this, I mean, obviously, the exact number would depend on</p>
<p>where you started counting, like which ancestors was human enough to count as human.</p>
<p>But those are not really important, there are relatively few of them.</p>
<p>So yeah, so you&rsquo;re roughly 100 billion.</p>
<p>Now, if they&rsquo;re only going to be 200 billion in total, that&rsquo;s a perfectly unremarkable</p>
<p>number.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re somewhere in the middle, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a run of the mill human, completely unsurprising.</p>
<p>Now, if they&rsquo;re going to be 200 trillion, you would be remarkably early, like what are</p>
<p>the chances out of these 200 trillion human that you should be human number 100 billion?</p>
<p>That seems it would have a much lower conditional probability.</p>
<p>And so analogously to how in the urn case, you thought after finding this low numbered</p>
<p>random sample, you update it in favor of the urn having few balls.</p>
<p>Similarly, in this case, you should update in favor of the human species having a lower</p>
<p>total number of members that is doomed soon.</p>
<p>You said doomed soon?</p>
<p>Well, that would be the hypothesis in this case that it will end 100 billion.</p>
<p>I just like that term for that hypothesis.</p>
<p>So what it kind of crucially relies on, the Doomsday Argument, is the idea that you should</p>
<p>reason as if you were a random sample from the set of all humans that will have existed.</p>
<p>If you have that assumption, then I think the rest kind of follows.</p>
<p>The question then is, why should you make that assumption?</p>
<p>In fact, you know you&rsquo;re 100 billion, so where do you get this prior?</p>
<p>And then there is like a literature on that with different ways of supporting that assumption.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just one example of anthropic reasoning, right?</p>
<p>That seems to be kind of convenient when you think about humanity, when you think about</p>
<p>sort of even like existential threats and so on, as it seems that quite naturally that</p>
<p>you should assume that you&rsquo;re just an average case.</p>
<p>Yeah, that you&rsquo;re kind of a typical randomly sample.</p>
<p>Now, in the case of the Doomsday Argument, it seems to lead to what intuitively we think</p>
<p>is the wrong conclusion, or at least many people have this reaction that there&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>to be something fishy about this argument.</p>
<p>Because from very, very weak premises, it gets this very striking implication that we</p>
<p>have almost no chance of reaching size 200 trillion humans in the future.</p>
<p>And how could we possibly get there just by reflecting on when we were born?</p>
<p>It seems you would need sophisticated arguments about the impossibility of space colonization,</p>
<p>blah, blah.</p>
<p>So one might be tempted to reject this key assumption, I call it the self sampling assumption,</p>
<p>the idea that you should reason as if you&rsquo;re a random sample from all observers or in your</p>
<p>some reference class.</p>
<p>However, it turns out that in other domains, it looks like we need something like this</p>
<p>self sampling assumption to make sense of bona fide scientific inferences.</p>
<p>In contemporary cosmology, for example, you have these multiverse theories.</p>
<p>And according to a lot of those, all possible human observations are made.</p>
<p>So if you have a sufficiently large universe, you will have a lot of people observing all</p>
<p>kinds of different things.</p>
<p>So if you have two competing theories, say about the value of some constant, it could</p>
<p>be true according to both of these theories that there will be some observers observing</p>
<p>the value that corresponds to the other theory, because there will be some observers that</p>
<p>have hallucinations, so there&rsquo;s a local fluctuation or a statistically anomalous measurement,</p>
<p>these things will happen.</p>
<p>And if enough observers make enough different observations, there will be some that sort</p>
<p>of by chance make these different ones.</p>
<p>And so what we would want to say is, well, many more observers, a larger proportion of</p>
<p>the observers will observe as it were the true value.</p>
<p>And a few will observe the wrong value.</p>
<p>If we think of ourselves as a random sample, we should expect with a probability to observe</p>
<p>the true value and that will then allow us to conclude that the evidence we actually</p>
<p>have is evidence for the theories we think are supported.</p>
<p>It kind of then is a way of making sense of these inferences that clearly seem correct,</p>
<p>that we can make various observations and infer what the temperature of the cosmic background</p>
<p>is and the fine structure constant and all of this.</p>
<p>But it seems that without rolling in some assumption similar to the self sampling assumption,</p>
<p>this inference just doesn&rsquo;t go through.</p>
<p>And there are other examples.</p>
<p>So there are these scientific contexts where it looks like this kind of anthropic reasoning</p>
<p>is needed and makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>And yet, in the case of the Dupest argument, it has this weird consequence and people might</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s something wrong with it there.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s then this project that would consist in trying to figure out what are the legitimate</p>
<p>ways of reasoning about these indexical facts when observer selection effects are in play.</p>
<p>In other words, developing a theory of anthropics.</p>
<p>And there are different views of looking at that and it&rsquo;s a difficult methodological area.</p>
<p>But to tie it back to the simulation argument, the key assumption there, this bland principle</p>
<p>of indifference, is much weaker than the self sampling assumption.</p>
<p>So if you think about, in the case of the Dupest argument, it says you should reason</p>
<p>as if you are a random sample from all humans that will have lived, even though in fact</p>
<p>you know that you are about number 100 billionth human and you&rsquo;re alive in the year 2020.</p>
<p>Whereas in the case of the simulation argument, it says that, well, if you actually have no</p>
<p>way of telling which one you are, then you should assign this kind of uniform probability.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, your role as the observer in the simulation argument is different, it seems</p>
<p>like.</p>
<p>Like who&rsquo;s the observer?</p>
<p>I mean, I keep assigning the individual consciousness.</p>
<p>But a lot of observers in the context of the simulation argument, the relevant observers</p>
<p>would be A, the people in original histories, and B, the people in simulations.</p>
<p>So this would be the class of observers that we need, I mean, they&rsquo;re also maybe the simulators,</p>
<p>but we can set those aside for this.</p>
<p>So the question is, given that class of observers, a small set of original history observers</p>
<p>and a large class of simulated observers, which one should you think is you?</p>
<p>Where are you amongst this set of observers?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m maybe having a little bit of trouble wrapping my head around the intricacies of what it</p>
<p>means to be an observer in this, in the different instantiations of the anthropic reasoning</p>
<p>cases that we mentioned.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, does it have to be&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the observer.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it may be an easier way of putting it is just like, are you simulated, are you</p>
<p>not simulated, given this assumption that these two groups of people exist?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In the simulation case, it seems pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the key point is the methodological assumption you need to make to get the simulation argument</p>
<p>to where it wants to go is much weaker and less problematic than the methodological assumption</p>
<p>you need to make to get the doomsday argument to its conclusion.</p>
<p>Maybe the doomsday argument is sound or unsound, but you need to make a much stronger and more</p>
<p>controversial assumption to make it go through.</p>
<p>In the case of the simulation argument, I guess one maybe way intuition pumped to support</p>
<p>this bland principle of indifference is to consider a sequence of different cases where</p>
<p>the fraction of people who are simulated to non simulated approaches one.</p>
<p>So in the limiting case where everybody is simulated, obviously you can deduce with certainty</p>
<p>that you are simulated.</p>
<p>If everybody with your experiences is simulated and you know you&rsquo;ve got to be one of those,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need a probability at all, you just kind of logically conclude it, right?</p>
<p>So then as we move from a case where say 90% of everybody is simulated, 99%, 99.9%, it</p>
<p>should seem plausible that the probability you assign should sort of approach one certainty</p>
<p>as the fraction approaches the case where everybody is in a simulation.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t expect that to be a discrete, well, if there&rsquo;s one non simulated person,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s 50, 50, but if we move that, then it&rsquo;s 100%, like it should kind of, there are</p>
<p>other arguments as well one can use to support this bland principle of indifference, but</p>
<p>that might be enough to.</p>
<p>But in general, when you start from time equals zero and go into the future, the fraction</p>
<p>of simulated, if it&rsquo;s possible to create simulated worlds, the fraction of simulated worlds will</p>
<p>go to one.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it won&rsquo;t go all the way to one.</p>
<p>In reality, that would be some ratio, although maybe a technologically mature civilization</p>
<p>could run a lot of simulations using a small portion of its resources, it probably wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be able to run infinitely many.</p>
<p>I mean, if we take say the observed, the physics in the observed universe, if we assume that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also the physics at the level of the simulators, that would be limits to the amount</p>
<p>of information processing that any one civilization could perform in its future trajectory.</p>
<p>First of all, there&rsquo;s limited amount of matter you can get your hands off because with a</p>
<p>positive cosmological constant, the universe is accelerating, there&rsquo;s like a finite sphere</p>
<p>of stuff, even if you traveled with the speed of light that you could ever reach, you have</p>
<p>a finite amount of stuff.</p>
<p>And then if you think there is like a lower limit to the amount of loss you get when you</p>
<p>perform an erasure of a computation, or if you think, for example, just matter gradually</p>
<p>over cosmological timescales, decay, maybe protons decay, other things, and you radiate</p>
<p>out gravitational waves, like there&rsquo;s all kinds of seemingly unavoidable losses that</p>
<p>occur.</p>
<p>Eventually, we&rsquo;ll have something like a heat death of the universe or a cold death or whatever,</p>
<p>but yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s finite, but of course, we don&rsquo;t know which, if there&rsquo;s many ancestral simulations,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know which level we are.</p>
<p>So there could be, couldn&rsquo;t there be like an arbitrary number of simulation that spawned</p>
<p>ours, and those had more resources, in terms of physical universe to work with?</p>
<p>Sorry, what do you mean that that could be?</p>
<p>Sort of, okay, so if simulations spawn other simulations, it seems like each new spawn</p>
<p>has fewer resources to work with.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t know at which step along the way we are at.</p>
<p>Any one observer doesn&rsquo;t know whether we&rsquo;re in level 42, or 100, or one, or is that not</p>
<p>matter for the resources?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s true that there would be uncertainty as to, you could have stacked simulations,</p>
<p>and that could then be uncertainty as to which level we are at.</p>
<p>As you remarked also, all the computations performed in a simulation within the simulation</p>
<p>also have to be expanded at the level of the simulation.</p>
<p>So the computer in basement reality where all these simulations with the simulations</p>
<p>with the simulations are taking place, like that computer, ultimately, it&rsquo;s CPU or whatever</p>
<p>it is, like that has to power this whole tower, right?</p>
<p>So if there is a finite compute power in basement reality, that would impose a limit to how</p>
<p>tall this tower can be.</p>
<p>And if each level kind of imposes a large extra overhead, you might think maybe the</p>
<p>tower would not be very tall, that most people would be low down in the tower.</p>
<p>I love the term basement reality.</p>
<p>Let me ask one of the popularizers, you said there&rsquo;s many through this, when you look at</p>
<p>sort of the last few years of the simulation hypothesis, just like you said, it comes up</p>
<p>every once in a while, some new community discovers it and so on.</p>
<p>But I would say one of the biggest popularizers of this idea is Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Do you have any kind of intuition about what Elon thinks about when he thinks about simulation?</p>
<p>Why is this of such interest?</p>
<p>Is it all the things we&rsquo;ve talked about, or is there some special kind of intuition about</p>
<p>simulation that he has?</p>
<p>I mean, you might have a better, I think, I mean, why it&rsquo;s of interest, I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like seems pretty obvious why, to the extent that one thinks the argument is credible,</p>
<p>why it would be of interest, it would, if it&rsquo;s correct, tell us something very important</p>
<p>about the world in one way or the other, whichever of the three alternatives for a simulation</p>
<p>that seems like arguably one of the most fundamental discoveries, right?</p>
<p>Now, interestingly, in the case of someone like Elon, so there&rsquo;s like the standard arguments</p>
<p>for why you might want to take the simulation hypothesis seriously, the simulation argument,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>In the case that if you are actually Elon Musk, let us say, there&rsquo;s a kind of an additional</p>
<p>reason in that what are the chances you would be Elon Musk?</p>
<p>It seems like maybe there would be more interest in simulating the lives of very unusual and</p>
<p>remarkable people.</p>
<p>So if you consider not just simulations where all of human history or the whole of human</p>
<p>civilization are simulated, but also other kinds of simulations, which only include some</p>
<p>subset of people, like in those simulations that only include a subset, it might be more</p>
<p>likely that they would include subsets of people with unusually interesting or consequential</p>
<p>lives.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re Elon Musk, it&rsquo;s more likely that you&rsquo;re an inspiration.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re Donald Trump, or if you&rsquo;re Bill Gates, or you&rsquo;re like, some particularly</p>
<p>like distinctive character, you might think that that, I mean, if you just think of yourself</p>
<p>into the shoes, right, it&rsquo;s got to be like an extra reason to think that&rsquo;s kind of.</p>
<p>So interesting.</p>
<p>So on a scale of like farmer in Peru to Elon Musk, the more you get towards the Elon Musk,</p>
<p>the higher the probability.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d imagine that would be some extra boost from that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an extra boost.</p>
<p>So he also asked the question of what he would ask an AGI saying, the question being, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>outside the simulation?</p>
<p>Do you think about the answer to this question?</p>
<p>If we are living in a simulation, what is outside the simulation?</p>
<p>So the programmer of the simulation?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think it connects to the question of what&rsquo;s inside the simulation in that.</p>
<p>So if you had views about the creators of the simulation, it might help you make predictions</p>
<p>about what kind of simulation it is, what might happen, what happens after the simulation,</p>
<p>if there is some after, but also like the kind of setup.</p>
<p>So these two questions would be quite closely intertwined.</p>
<p>But do you think it would be very surprising to like, is the stuff inside the simulation,</p>
<p>is it possible for it to be fundamentally different than the stuff outside?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, another way to put it, can the creatures inside the simulation be smart enough to even</p>
<p>understand or have the cognitive capabilities or any kind of information processing capabilities</p>
<p>enough to understand the mechanism that created them?</p>
<p>They might understand some aspects of it.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a level of, it&rsquo;s kind of, there are levels of explanation, like degrees to</p>
<p>which you can understand.</p>
<p>So does your dog understand what it is to be human?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s got some idea, like humans are these physical objects that move around and</p>
<p>do things.</p>
<p>And a normal human would have a deeper understanding of what it is to be a human.</p>
<p>And maybe some very experienced psychologist or great novelist might understand a little</p>
<p>bit more about what it is to be human.</p>
<p>And maybe superintelligence could see right through your soul.</p>
<p>So similarly, I do think that we are quite limited in our ability to understand all of</p>
<p>the relevant aspects of the larger context that we exist in.</p>
<p>But there might be hope for some.</p>
<p>I think we understand some aspects of it.</p>
<p>But you know, how much good is that?</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s like one key aspect that changes the significance of all the other aspects.</p>
<p>So we understand maybe seven out of 10 key insights that you need.</p>
<p>But the answer actually, like varies completely depending on what like number eight, nine</p>
<p>and 10 insight is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like whether you want to suppose that the big task were to guess whether a certain</p>
<p>number was odd or even, like a 10 digit number.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s even, the best thing for you to do in life is to go north.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s odd, the best thing for you is to go south.</p>
<p>Now we are in a situation where maybe through our science and philosophy, we figured out</p>
<p>what the first seven digits are.</p>
<p>So we have a lot of information, right?</p>
<p>Most of it we figured out.</p>
<p>But we are clueless about what the last three digits are.</p>
<p>So we are still completely clueless about whether the number is odd or even and therefore</p>
<p>whether we should go north or go south.</p>
<p>I feel that&rsquo;s an analogy, but I feel we&rsquo;re somewhat in that predicament.</p>
<p>We know a lot about the universe.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve come maybe more than half of the way there to kind of fully understanding it.</p>
<p>But the parts we&rsquo;re missing are plausibly ones that could completely change the overall</p>
<p>upshot of the thing and including change our overall view about what the scheme of priorities</p>
<p>should be or which strategic direction would make sense to pursue.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think your analogy of us being the dog trying to understand human beings is an entertaining</p>
<p>one, and probably correct.</p>
<p>The closer the understanding tends from the dog&rsquo;s viewpoint to us human psychologist viewpoint,</p>
<p>the steps along the way there will have completely transformative ideas of what it means to be</p>
<p>human.</p>
<p>So the dog has a very shallow understanding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to think that, to analogize that a dog&rsquo;s understanding of a human being</p>
<p>is the same as our current understanding of the fundamental laws of physics in the universe.</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>We spent an hour and 40 minutes talking about the simulation.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about super intelligence.</p>
<p>At least for a little bit.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s start at the basics.</p>
<p>What to you is intelligence?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I tend not to get too stuck with the definitional question.</p>
<p>I mean, the common sense to understand, like the ability to solve complex problems, to</p>
<p>learn from experience, to plan, to reason, some combination of things like that.</p>
<p>Is consciousness mixed up into that or no?</p>
<p>Is consciousness mixed up into that?</p>
<p>Well, I think it could be fairly intelligent at least without being conscious probably.</p>
<p>So then what is super intelligence?</p>
<p>That would be like something that was much more, had much more general cognitive capacity</p>
<p>than we humans have.</p>
<p>So if we talk about general super intelligence, it would be much faster learner be able to</p>
<p>reason much better, make plans that are more effective at achieving its goals, say in a</p>
<p>wide range of complex challenging environments.</p>
<p>In terms of as we turn our eye to the idea of sort of existential threats from super</p>
<p>intelligence, do you think super intelligence has to exist in the physical world or can</p>
<p>it be digital only?</p>
<p>Sort of we think of our general intelligence as us humans, as an intelligence that&rsquo;s associated</p>
<p>with the body, that&rsquo;s able to interact with the world, that&rsquo;s able to affect the world</p>
<p>directly with physically.</p>
<p>I mean, digital only is perfectly fine, I think.</p>
<p>I mean, you could, it&rsquo;s physical in the sense that obviously the computers and the memories</p>
<p>are physical.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s capability to affect the world sort of.</p>
<p>Could be very strong, even if it has a limited set of actuators, if it can type text on the</p>
<p>screen or something like that, that would be, I think, ample.</p>
<p>So in terms of the concerns of existential threat of AI, how can an AI system that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the digital world have existential risk, sort of, and what are the attack vectors for</p>
<p>a digital system?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I guess maybe to take one step back, so I should emphasize that I also think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this huge positive potential from machine intelligence, including super intelligence.</p>
<p>And I want to stress that because some of my writing has focused on what can go wrong.</p>
<p>And when I wrote the book Superintelligence, at that point, I felt that there was a kind</p>
<p>of neglect of what would happen if AI succeeds, and in particular, a need to get a more granular</p>
<p>understanding of where the pitfalls are so we can avoid them.</p>
<p>I think that since the book came out in 2014, there has been a much wider recognition of</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>And a number of research groups are now actually working on developing, say, AI alignment techniques</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think now it&rsquo;s important to make sure we bring back onto the table the upside</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a little bit of a neglect now on the upside, which is, I mean, if you look</p>
<p>at, I was talking to a friend, if you look at the amount of information that is available,</p>
<p>or people talking and people being excited about the positive possibilities of general</p>
<p>intelligence, that&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s far outnumbered by the negative possibilities in terms of</p>
<p>our public discourse.</p>
<p>Possibly, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to measure.</p>
<p>But what are, can you linger on that for a little bit, what are some, to you, possible</p>
<p>big positive impacts of general intelligence?</p>
<p>Super intelligence?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, super intelligence, because I tend to also want to distinguish these two</p>
<p>different contexts of thinking about AI and AI impacts, the kind of near term and long</p>
<p>term, if you want, both of which I think are legitimate things to think about, and people</p>
<p>should discuss both of them, but they are different and they often get mixed up.</p>
<p>And then, then I get, you get confusion, like, I think you get simultaneously like maybe</p>
<p>an overhyping of the near term and then under hyping of the long term.</p>
<p>And so I think as long as we keep them apart, we can have like, two good conversations,</p>
<p>but or we can mix them together and have one bad conversation.</p>
<p>Can you clarify just the two things we were talking about, the near term and the long</p>
<p>term?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And what are the distinctions?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a blurry distinction.</p>
<p>But say the things I wrote about in this book, super intelligence, long term, things people</p>
<p>are worrying about today with, I don&rsquo;t know, algorithmic discrimination, or even things,</p>
<p>self driving cars and drones and stuff, more near term.</p>
<p>And then of course, you could imagine some medium term where they kind of overlap and</p>
<p>they one evolves into the other.</p>
<p>But at any rate, I think both, yeah, the issues look kind of somewhat different depending</p>
<p>on which of these contexts.</p>
<p>So I think, I think it&rsquo;d be nice if we can talk about the long term and think about a</p>
<p>positive impact or a better world because of the existence of the long term super intelligence.</p>
<p>Do you have views of such a world?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess it&rsquo;s a little hard to articulate because it seems obvious that the world has</p>
<p>a lot of problems as it currently stands.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to think of any one of those, which it wouldn&rsquo;t be useful to have like a</p>
<p>friendly aligned super intelligence working on.</p>
<p>So from health to the economic system to be able to sort of improve the investment and</p>
<p>trade and foreign policy decisions, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>All that kind of stuff and a lot more.</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s the killer app?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think there is one.</p>
<p>I think AI, especially artificial general intelligence is really the ultimate general</p>
<p>purpose technology.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that there is this one problem, this one area where it will have a big impact.</p>
<p>But if and when it succeeds, it will really apply across the board in all fields where</p>
<p>human creativity and intelligence and problem solving is useful, which is pretty much all</p>
<p>fields.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>The thing that it would do is give us a lot more control over nature.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t automatically solve the problems that arise from conflict between humans, fundamentally</p>
<p>political problems.</p>
<p>Some subset of those might go away if you just had more resources and cooler tech.</p>
<p>But some subset would require coordination that is not automatically achieved just by</p>
<p>having more technological capability.</p>
<p>But anything that&rsquo;s not of that sort, I think you just get an enormous boost with this kind</p>
<p>of cognitive technology once it goes all the way.</p>
<p>Now, again, that doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m thinking, oh, people don&rsquo;t recognize what&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>with current technology and like sometimes things get overhyped.</p>
<p>But I mean, those are perfectly consistent views to hold.</p>
<p>The ultimate potential being enormous.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s a very different question of how far are we from that or what can we do</p>
<p>with near term technology?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your intuition about the idea of intelligence explosion?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this, you know, when you start to think about that leap from the near term</p>
<p>to the long term, the natural inclination, like for me, sort of building machine learning</p>
<p>systems today, it seems like it&rsquo;s a lot of work to get the general intelligence, but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some intuition of exponential growth of exponential improvement of intelligence</p>
<p>explosion.</p>
<p>Can you maybe try to elucidate, try to talk about what&rsquo;s your intuition about the possibility</p>
<p>of an intelligence explosion, that it won&rsquo;t be this gradual slow process, there might</p>
<p>be a phase shift?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s, we don&rsquo;t know how explosive it will be.</p>
<p>I think for what it&rsquo;s worth, it seems fairly likely to me that at some point, there will</p>
<p>be some intelligence explosion, like some period of time, where progress in AI becomes</p>
<p>extremely rapid, roughly, roughly in the area where you might say it&rsquo;s kind of humanish</p>
<p>equivalent in core cognitive faculties, that the concept of human equivalent starts to</p>
<p>break down when you look too closely at it.</p>
<p>And just how explosive does something have to be for it to be called an intelligence</p>
<p>explosion?</p>
<p>Like, does it have to be like overnight, literally, or a few years?</p>
<p>But overall, I guess, if you plotted the opinions of different people in the world, I guess</p>
<p>that would be somewhat more probability towards the intelligence explosion scenario than probably</p>
<p>the average, you know, AI researcher, I guess.</p>
<p>So and then the other part of the intelligence explosion, or just forget explosion, just</p>
<p>progress is once you achieve that gray area of human level intelligence, is it obvious</p>
<p>to you that we should be able to proceed beyond it to get to super intelligence?</p>
<p>Yeah, that seems, I mean, as much as any of these things can be obvious, given we&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>had one, people have different views, smart people have different views, it&rsquo;s like some</p>
<p>degree of uncertainty that always remains for any big, futuristic, philosophical grand</p>
<p>question that just we realize humans are fallible, especially about these things.</p>
<p>But it does seem, as far as I&rsquo;m judging things based on my own impressions, that it seems</p>
<p>very unlikely that that would be a ceiling at or near human cognitive capacity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s such a, I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s such a special moment, it&rsquo;s both terrifying and</p>
<p>exciting to create a system that&rsquo;s beyond our intelligence.</p>
<p>So maybe you can step back and say, like, how does that possibility make you feel that</p>
<p>we can create something, it feels like there&rsquo;s a line beyond which it steps, it&rsquo;ll be able</p>
<p>to outsmart you.</p>
<p>And therefore, it feels like a step where we lose control.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think the latter follows that is you could imagine.</p>
<p>And in fact, this is what a number of people are working towards making sure that we could</p>
<p>ultimately project higher levels of problem solving ability while still making sure that</p>
<p>they are aligned, like they are in the service of human values.</p>
<p>I mean, so losing control, I think, is not a given that that would happen.</p>
<p>Now you asked how it makes me feel, I mean, to some extent, I&rsquo;ve lived with this for so</p>
<p>long, since as long as I can remember, being an adult or even a teenager, it seemed to</p>
<p>me obvious that at some point, AI will succeed.</p>
<p>And so I actually misspoke, I didn&rsquo;t mean control, I meant, because the control problem</p>
<p>is an interesting thing.</p>
<p>And I think the hope is, at least we should be able to maintain control over systems that</p>
<p>are smarter than us.</p>
<p>But we do lose our specialness, it sort of will lose our place as the smartest, coolest</p>
<p>thing on earth.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an ego involved with that, that humans aren&rsquo;t very good at dealing with.</p>
<p>I mean, I value my intelligence as a human being.</p>
<p>It seems like a big transformative step to realize there&rsquo;s something out there that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more intelligent.</p>
<p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t see that as such a fundamentally&hellip;</p>
<p>I think yes, a lot, I think it would be small, because I mean, I think there are already</p>
<p>a lot of things out there that are, I mean, certainly, if you think the universe is big,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be other civilizations that already have super intelligences, or that</p>
<p>just naturally have brains the size of beach balls and are like, completely leaving us</p>
<p>in the dust.</p>
<p>And we haven&rsquo;t come face to face with them.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t come face to face.</p>
<p>But I mean, that&rsquo;s an open question, what would happen in a kind of post human world?</p>
<p>Like how much day to day would these super intelligences be involved in the lives of</p>
<p>ordinary?</p>
<p>I mean, you could imagine some scenario where it would be more like a background thing that</p>
<p>would help protect against some things, but you wouldn&rsquo;t like that, they wouldn&rsquo;t be this</p>
<p>intrusive kind of, like making you feel bad by like, making clever jokes on your expert,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s like all sorts of things that maybe in the human context would feel awkward</p>
<p>about that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be the dumbest kid in your class, everybody picks it, like, a lot of</p>
<p>those things, maybe you need to abstract away from, if you&rsquo;re thinking about this context</p>
<p>where we have infrastructure that is in some sense, beyond any or all humans.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a little bit like, say, the scientific community as a whole, if you think of that</p>
<p>as a mind, it&rsquo;s a little bit of a metaphor.</p>
<p>But I mean, obviously, it&rsquo;s got to be like, way more capacious than any individual.</p>
<p>So in some sense, there is this mind like thing already out there that&rsquo;s just vastly</p>
<p>more intelligent than any individual is.</p>
<p>And we think, okay, that&rsquo;s, you just accept that as a fact.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the basic fabric of our existence is there&rsquo;s super intelligent.</p>
<p>You get used to a lot of, I mean, there&rsquo;s already Google and Twitter and Facebook, these</p>
<p>recommender systems that are the basic fabric of our, I could see them becoming, I mean,</p>
<p>do you think of the collective intelligence of these systems as already perhaps reaching</p>
<p>super intelligence level?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, so here it comes to the concept of intelligence and the scale and what human</p>
<p>level means.</p>
<p>The kind of vagueness and indeterminacy of those concepts starts to dominate how you</p>
<p>would answer that question.</p>
<p>So like, say the Google search engine has a very high capacity of a certain kind, like</p>
<p>retrieving, remembering and retrieving information, particularly like text or images that are,</p>
<p>you have a kind of string, a word string key, obviously superhuman at that, but a vast set</p>
<p>of other things it can&rsquo;t even do at all.</p>
<p>Not just not do well, but so you have these current AI systems that are superhuman in</p>
<p>some limited domain and then like radically subhuman in all other domains.</p>
<p>Same with a chess, like are just a simple computer that can multiply really large numbers,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to have this like one spike of super intelligence and then a kind of a</p>
<p>zero level of capability across all other cognitive fields.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t necessarily think the generalness, I mean, I&rsquo;m not so attached with it, but I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s sort of, it&rsquo;s a gray area and it&rsquo;s a feeling, but to me sort of alpha zero is</p>
<p>somehow much more intelligent, much, much more intelligent than Deep Blue.</p>
<p>And to say which domain, you could say, well, these are both just board games, they&rsquo;re both</p>
<p>just able to play board games, who cares if they&rsquo;re going to do better or not, but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something about the learning, the self play that makes it, crosses over into that land</p>
<p>of intelligence that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily need to be general.</p>
<p>In the same way, Google is much closer to Deep Blue currently in terms of its search</p>
<p>engine than it is to sort of the alpha zero.</p>
<p>And the moment it becomes, the moment these recommender systems really become more like</p>
<p>alpha zero, but being able to learn a lot without the constraints of being heavily constrained</p>
<p>by human interaction, that seems like a special moment in time.</p>
<p>I mean, certainly learning ability seems to be an important facet of general intelligence,</p>
<p>that you can take some new domain that you haven&rsquo;t seen before and you weren&rsquo;t specifically</p>
<p>pre programmed for, and then figure out what&rsquo;s going on there and eventually become really</p>
<p>good at it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something alpha zero has much more of than Deep Blue had.</p>
<p>And in fact, I mean, systems like alpha zero can learn not just Go, but other, in fact,</p>
<p>probably beat Deep Blue in chess and so forth.</p>
<p>So you do see this as general and it matches the intuition.</p>
<p>We feel it&rsquo;s more intelligent and it also has more of this general purpose learning</p>
<p>ability.</p>
<p>And if we get systems that have even more general purpose learning ability, it might</p>
<p>also trigger an even stronger intuition that they are actually starting to get smart.</p>
<p>So if you were to pick a future, what do you think a utopia looks like with AGI systems?</p>
<p>Sort of, is it the neural link brain computer interface world where we&rsquo;re kind of really</p>
<p>closely interlinked with AI systems?</p>
<p>Is it possibly where AGI systems replace us completely while maintaining the values and</p>
<p>the consciousness?</p>
<p>Is it something like it&rsquo;s a completely invisible fabric, like you mentioned, a society where</p>
<p>just aids and a lot of stuff that we do like curing diseases and so on.</p>
<p>What is utopia if you get to pick?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it is a good question and a deep and difficult one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite interested in it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have all the answers yet, but I might never have.</p>
<p>But I think there are some different observations one can make.</p>
<p>One is if this scenario actually did come to pass, it would open up this vast space</p>
<p>of possible modes of being.</p>
<p>On one hand, material and resource constraints would just be like expanded dramatically.</p>
<p>So there would be a lot of a big pie, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>Also it would enable us to do things, including to ourselves, it would just open up this much</p>
<p>larger design space and option space than we have ever had access to in human history.</p>
<p>I think two things follow from that.</p>
<p>One is that we probably would need to make a fairly fundamental rethink of what ultimately</p>
<p>we value, like think things through more from first principles.</p>
<p>The context would be so different from the familiar that we could have just take what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve always been doing and then like, oh, well, we have this cleaning robot that cleans</p>
<p>the dishes in the sink and a few other small things.</p>
<p>I think we would have to go back to first principles.</p>
<p>So even from the individual level, go back to the first principles of what is the meaning</p>
<p>of life, what is happiness, what is fulfillment.</p>
<p>And then also connected to this large space of resources is that it would be possible.</p>
<p>And I think something we should aim for is to do well by the lights of more than one</p>
<p>value system.</p>
<p>That is, we wouldn&rsquo;t have to choose only one value criterion and say we&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>something that scores really high on the metric of, say, hedonism, and then is like a zero</p>
<p>by other criteria, like kind of wireheaded brain synovat, and it&rsquo;s like a lot of pleasure,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good, but then like no beauty, no achievement like that.</p>
<p>Or pick it up, I think to some significant, not unlimited sense, but the significant sense,</p>
<p>it would be possible to do very well by many criteria, like maybe you could get like 98%</p>
<p>of the best according to several criteria at the same time, given this great expansion</p>
<p>of the option space.</p>
<p>So have competing value systems, competing criteria, as a sort of forever, just like</p>
<p>our Democrat versus Republican, there seems to be this always multiple parties that are</p>
<p>useful for our progress in society, even though it might seem dysfunctional inside the moment,</p>
<p>but having the multiple value system seems to be beneficial for, I guess, a balance of</p>
<p>power.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, yeah, not exactly what I have in mind that it, well, although maybe in an indirect</p>
<p>way it is, but that if you had the chance to do something that scored well on several</p>
<p>different metrics, our first instinct should be to do that rather than immediately leap</p>
<p>to the thing, which ones of these value systems are we going to screw over?</p>
<p>Like our first, let&rsquo;s first try to do very well by all of them.</p>
<p>Then it might be that you can&rsquo;t get 100% of all and you would have to then like have the</p>
<p>hard conversation about which one will only get 97%.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s my cynicism that all of existence is always a trade off, but you say, maybe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not such a bad trade off.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first at least try it.</p>
<p>Well, this would be a distinctive context in which at least some of the constraints</p>
<p>would be removed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave it at that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s probably still be trade offs in the end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that we should first make sure we at least take advantage of this abundance.</p>
<p>So in terms of thinking about this, like, yeah, one should think, I think in this kind</p>
<p>of frame of mind of generosity and inclusiveness to different value systems and see how far</p>
<p>one can get there at first.</p>
<p>And I think one could do something that would be very good according to many different criteria.</p>
<p>We kind of talked about AGI fundamentally transforming the value system of our existence,</p>
<p>the meaning of life.</p>
<p>But today, what do you think is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>The silliest or perhaps the biggest question, what&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of existence?</p>
<p>What gives your life fulfillment, purpose, happiness, meaning?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think these are, I guess, a bunch of different but related questions in there</p>
<p>that one can ask.</p>
<p>Happiness meaning.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, like you could imagine somebody getting a lot of happiness from something that they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t think was meaningful.</p>
<p>Like mindless, like watching reruns of some television series, waiting junk food, like</p>
<p>maybe some people that gives pleasure, but they wouldn&rsquo;t think it had a lot of meaning.</p>
<p>Whereas, conversely, something that might be quite loaded with meaning might not be</p>
<p>very fun always, like some difficult achievement that really helps a lot of people, maybe requires</p>
<p>self sacrifice and hard work.</p>
<p>So these things can, I think, come apart, which is something to bear in mind also when</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re thinking about these utopia questions that you might, to actually start to do some</p>
<p>constructive thinking about that, you might have to isolate and distinguish these different</p>
<p>kinds of things that might be valuable in different ways.</p>
<p>Make sure you can sort of clearly perceive each one of them and then you can think about</p>
<p>how you can combine them.</p>
<p>And just as you said, hopefully come up with a way to maximize all of them together.</p>
<p>Yeah, or at least get, I mean, maximize or get like a very high score on a wide range</p>
<p>of them, even if not literally all.</p>
<p>You can always come up with values that are exactly opposed to one another, right?</p>
<p>But I think for many values, they&rsquo;re kind of opposed with, if you place them within</p>
<p>a certain dimensionality of your space, like there are shapes that are kind of, you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>untangle like in a given dimensionality, but if you start adding dimensions, then it might</p>
<p>in many cases just be that they are easy to pull apart and you could.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll see how much space there is for that, but I think that there could be a lot in this</p>
<p>context of radical abundance, if ever we get to that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end it, Nick.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve influenced a huge number of people to work on what could very well be the most</p>
<p>important problems of our time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a huge honor.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking.</p>
<p>Well, thank you for coming by, Lex.</p>

<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from Nick Bostrom.</p>
<p>Our approach to existential risks cannot be one of trial and error.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no opportunity to learn from errors.</p>
<p>The reactive approach, see what happens, limit damages, and learn from experience is unworkable.</p>
<p>Rather, we must take a proactive approach.</p>
<p>This requires foresight to anticipate new types of threats and a willingness to take</p>
<p>decisive, preventative action and to bear the costs, moral and economic, of such actions.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
