that there&amp;rsquo;s something in there but there&amp;rsquo;s actually nothing in there what is this condition what can you do about it there&amp;rsquo;s a few different medical names for this condition if you wanted to know this it&amp;rsquo;s not important but what i&amp;rsquo;m going to give you today is some basic data on really what&amp;rsquo;s happening if we take a look at these structures right through here we have the pharynx which is in the back of the throat right here and let&amp;rsquo;s say i&amp;rsquo;m looking this way right here so the tongue is right here the jaw is right here and then we go from the pharynx right below it we have the larynx that&amp;rsquo;s your voice box okay we have the vocal cords you have a lot of other stuff going on there you have muscles and ligaments and cartilage right through here right below this you have the trachea the trachea is a structure that has an opening into your lungs okay so that&amp;rsquo;s where the trachea is and then right behind the trachea you have the esophagus that&amp;rsquo;s where the food goes down into the stomach and you have various valves and controls or sphincters sphincter is a muscular valve that can close like this and that&amp;rsquo;s controlled by certain parts of your autonomic nervous system and there&amp;rsquo;s a little flap through this structure to control the food to make sure the food doesn&amp;rsquo;t go down the wrong pipe and that&amp;rsquo;s called the epiglottis and so you have a lot going on in this area right here with nerves and muscles and tendons and cartilage and the coordination of allowing air and food and speaking now about a couple years ago i was doing lunch with an old client that i had and as i was sitting there i noticed that she started choking after she consumed some soup with some chunks of chicken and it got stuck in her throat and she&amp;rsquo;s like i can&amp;rsquo;t breathe right and i&amp;rsquo;ve never ever been in a situation where i had to perform the heimlich maneuver and i&amp;rsquo;m very quickly trying to remember how to do it and so i go behind her and i start to do the procedure and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work and she&amp;rsquo;s like he&amp;rsquo;s choking and i&amp;rsquo;m looking around and everyone&amp;rsquo;s just watching and i&amp;rsquo;m going oh my gosh she&amp;rsquo;s turning red she&amp;rsquo;s going to pass out and at that moment what came to mind is that this area of your body the vocal cords the structures in this area are highly innervated by the autonomic nervous system both the parasympathetic which is the vagus nerve as well as the sympathetic fibers and so what i told her is i just said relax just calm down just try to relax now i know it&amp;rsquo;s kind of difficult to try to get someone to calm down when they can&amp;rsquo;t breathe but she just sat down she relaxed and then she could start breathing and so one of the reasons i brought that up is that one of the triggers for having this lump in the throat sensation is stress so when you go through stress you activate these fingers and things can close up and you can have all sorts of problems including laryngitis and all sorts of hoarseness and problems with your vocal cords as well so this symptom can be activated by stress a virus low vitamin d levels which we&amp;rsquo;ll come back to that gerd which is an acid reflux situation and even a problem with the vagus nerve one of the things that&amp;rsquo;s happening is we&amp;rsquo;re getting a spasm in some of the soft tissue in this area right here and one of the medical names for a spasm in this area is laryngeal spasm and what&amp;rsquo;s interesting is if you look up this condition right here hypocalcemia that is low amounts of calcium in your blood one of the symptoms for this is this right here spasm in your larynx interesting that&amp;rsquo;s one of the symptoms so in practice what i would always give people is some simple calcium and it really would help them the type of calcium that i would recommend for this condition is calcium lactate i used to use calcium lactate from standard process and you can get that online it&amp;rsquo;s very inexpensive it works great and it&amp;rsquo;s non-dairy i would also believe calcium orotate would work too i haven&amp;rsquo;t tried it i do know that this works good for other types of spasms in the body as well as menstrual cramps and it&amp;rsquo;s a type of calcium that can penetrate the tissues very well but in practice i always use calcium lactate it&amp;rsquo;s a non-dairy very inexpensive you would take two or three an empty stomach each day and that seems to work very very well because what we&amp;rsquo;re dealing with is a spasm a muscular contraction another symptom of hypocalcemia is tetany which is a little twitching right here and you could actually have tetany and that can actually affect the um quality of a voice there&amp;rsquo;s actually a condition called stridor in infants where an infant&amp;rsquo;s voice is very harsh and raspy and take a while guess what causes that hypocalcemia and low vitamin d levels because one of the causes of hypocalcemia is low amounts of vitamin d so it could be that the person is low in calcium because they&amp;rsquo;re low in vitamin d which probably is actually pretty common so one of the things i would recommend to take on empty stomach is not just the calcium but the vitamin d as well we also know that if someone has gerd even though they have a acid reflux what&amp;rsquo;s really behind that is a low amount of acid in their stomach it&amp;rsquo;s called hypochlorhydria or a chlorhydria which means you have a deficiency of acid or you have no acid and what&amp;rsquo;s happening now is the valves aren&amp;rsquo;t closing and the acid is squirting up well if you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough acid guess what you&amp;rsquo;re not going to be able to absorb in the body calcium there&amp;rsquo;s a connection between low vitamin d and low calcium there&amp;rsquo;s also connection between viruses certain viruses and calcium too because calcium can help put certain viruses back in remission and too much stress over a period of time can deplete your calcium as well so anyway if you have a lump in the throat try this remedy and comment down below before you go if you have a question about a product or you&amp;rsquo;re new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you&amp;rsquo;re on keto and you need a debug because it&amp;rsquo;s not going as smooth i have a

<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>
<p>﻿so i want to talk about the symptom of having 
a lump in your throat a sensation that there&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>something in there but there&rsquo;s actually nothing 
in there what is this condition what can you do  </p>
<p>about it there&rsquo;s a few different medical names 
for this condition if you wanted to know this  </p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not important but what i&rsquo;m going to give 
you today is some basic data on really what&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>happening if we take a look at these structures 
right through here we have the pharynx which is  </p>
<p>in the back of the throat right here and let&rsquo;s 
say i&rsquo;m looking this way right here so the tongue  </p>
<p>is right here the jaw is right here and then we go 
from the pharynx right below it we have the larynx  </p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your voice box okay we have the vocal 
cords you have a lot of other stuff going on there  </p>
<p>you have muscles and ligaments and cartilage right 
through here right below this you have the trachea  </p>
<p>the trachea is a structure that has an opening 
into your lungs okay so that&rsquo;s where the trachea  </p>
<p>is and then right behind the trachea you have the 
esophagus that&rsquo;s where the food goes down into the  </p>
<p>stomach and you have various valves and controls 
or sphincters sphincter is a muscular valve that  </p>
<p>can close like this and that&rsquo;s controlled by 
certain parts of your autonomic nervous system  </p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a little flap through this structure 
to control the food to make sure the food doesn&rsquo;t  </p>
<p>go down the wrong pipe and that&rsquo;s called the 
epiglottis and so you have a lot going on  </p>
<p>in this area right here with nerves and muscles 
and tendons and cartilage and the coordination of  </p>
<p>allowing air and food and speaking 
now about a couple years ago i was  </p>
<p>doing lunch with an old client that i had and as 
i was sitting there i noticed that she started  </p>
<p>choking after she consumed some soup with some 
chunks of chicken and it got stuck in her throat  </p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like i can&rsquo;t breathe right and 
i&rsquo;ve never ever been in a situation where  </p>
<p>i had to perform the heimlich maneuver and i&rsquo;m 
very quickly trying to remember how to do it  </p>
<p>and so i go behind her and i start to do the 
procedure and it doesn&rsquo;t work and she&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>choking and i&rsquo;m looking around and everyone&rsquo;s just 
watching and i&rsquo;m going oh my gosh she&rsquo;s turning  </p>
<p>red she&rsquo;s going to pass out and at that moment 
what came to mind is that this area of your body  </p>
<p>the vocal cords the structures in this area are 
highly innervated by the autonomic nervous system  </p>
<p>both the parasympathetic which is the vagus 
nerve as well as the sympathetic fibers and so  </p>
<p>what i told her is i just said relax just calm 
down just try to relax now i know it&rsquo;s kind of  </p>
<p>difficult to try to get someone to calm down 
when they can&rsquo;t breathe but she just sat down she  </p>
<p>relaxed and then she could start breathing and so 
one of the reasons i brought that up is that one  </p>
<p>of the triggers for having this lump in the throat 
sensation is stress so when you go through stress  </p>
<p>you activate these fingers and things can close up 
and you can have all sorts of problems including  </p>
<p>laryngitis and all sorts of hoarseness 
and problems with your vocal cords as well  </p>
<p>so this symptom can be activated by stress a virus 
low vitamin d levels which we&rsquo;ll come back to that  </p>
<p>gerd which is an acid reflux situation and even 
a problem with the vagus nerve one of the things  </p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening is we&rsquo;re getting a spasm in 
some of the soft tissue in this area right here  </p>
<p>and one of the medical names for a spasm in this 
area is laryngeal spasm and what&rsquo;s interesting  </p>
<p>is if you look up this condition right here 
hypocalcemia that is low amounts of calcium  </p>
<p>in your blood one of the symptoms for this is 
this right here spasm in your larynx interesting  </p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the symptoms so in practice 
what i would always give people is some simple  </p>
<p>calcium and it really would help them the type of 
calcium that i would recommend for this condition  </p>
<p>is calcium lactate i used to use calcium 
lactate from standard process and you can  </p>
<p>get that online it&rsquo;s very inexpensive it works 
great and it&rsquo;s non-dairy i would also believe  </p>
<p>calcium orotate would work too i haven&rsquo;t tried it 
i do know that this works good for other types of  </p>
<p>spasms in the body as well as menstrual cramps 
and it&rsquo;s a type of calcium that can penetrate  </p>
<p>the tissues very well but in practice i always use 
calcium lactate it&rsquo;s a non-dairy very inexpensive  </p>
<p>you would take two or three an empty stomach 
each day and that seems to work very very well  </p>
<p>because what we&rsquo;re dealing with is a spasm 
a muscular contraction another symptom of  </p>
<p>hypocalcemia is tetany which is a little twitching 
right here and you could actually have tetany  </p>
<p>and that can actually affect the um quality of a 
voice there&rsquo;s actually a condition called stridor  </p>
<p>in infants where an infant&rsquo;s voice is very harsh 
and raspy and take a while guess what causes that  </p>
<p>hypocalcemia and low vitamin d levels because one 
of the causes of hypocalcemia is low amounts of  </p>
<p>vitamin d so it could be that the person is low 
in calcium because they&rsquo;re low in vitamin d which  </p>
<p>probably is actually pretty common so one of the 
things i would recommend to take on empty stomach  </p>
<p>is not just the calcium but the vitamin d as well 
we also know that if someone has gerd even though  </p>
<p>they have a acid reflux what&rsquo;s really behind 
that is a low amount of acid in their stomach  </p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called hypochlorhydria or a chlorhydria 
which means you have a deficiency of acid or  </p>
<p>you have no acid and what&rsquo;s happening now is the 
valves aren&rsquo;t closing and the acid is squirting up  </p>
<p>well if you don&rsquo;t have enough acid guess what 
you&rsquo;re not going to be able to absorb in the body  </p>
<p>calcium there&rsquo;s a connection between low vitamin 
d and low calcium there&rsquo;s also connection between  </p>
<p>viruses certain viruses and calcium too because 
calcium can help put certain viruses back in  </p>
<p>remission and too much stress over a period of 
time can deplete your calcium as well so anyway  </p>
<p>if you have a lump in the throat try this remedy 
and comment down below before you go if you have a  </p>
<p>question about a product or you&rsquo;re new to keto and 
you want to know how to begin keto or you&rsquo;re on  </p>
<p>keto and you need a debug because it&rsquo;s not going 
as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to  </p>
<p>help you this is just for the people in the 
us hopefully in the future we&rsquo;ll be able to  </p>
<p>answer everyone&rsquo;s call but i put the number 
down below so you can call and get some help</p>
