    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today is an Ask Me Anything, or AMA, episode,</p>
<p>which is part of our premium subscriber content.</p>
<p>Our premium channel was launched</p>
<p>in order to raise support</p>
<p>for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast channel,</p>
<p>which still comes out once a week, every Monday,</p>
<p>and of course is zero cost to consumer.</p>
<p>The premium channel is also designed</p>
<p>to support exciting research being done</p>
<p>at major universities like Stanford and elsewhere,</p>
<p>research that&rsquo;s done on humans</p>
<p>that should lead to protocols for mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance in the near future.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to check out</p>
<p>the premium channel subscription model,</p>
<p>you can go to hubermanlab.com slash premium,</p>
<p>and there you can subscribe for $10 a month</p>
<p>or $100 a year.</p>
<p>We also have a lifetime subscriber option.</p>
<p>For those of you that are already</p>
<p>Huberman Lab Podcast premium subscribers</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re watching and or hearing this,</p>
<p>please go to hubermanlab.com slash premium</p>
<p>and download the premium podcast feed.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are not already</p>
<p>Huberman Lab premium podcast subscribers,</p>
<p>you will be able to hear the first 15 minutes or so</p>
<p>of this episode,</p>
<p>and hopefully that will allow you to discern</p>
<p>whether or not you would like to become</p>
<p>a premium subscriber.</p>
<p>Without further ado,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get to answering your questions.</p>
<p>And as always, I will strive to be as accurate as possible,</p>
<p>as thorough as possible,</p>
<p>and yet as concise as possible.</p>
<p>Our first question is about motivation.</p>
<p>In particular, how to maintain motivation</p>
<p>over long periods of time.</p>
<p>This was a question asked by Martin Zokov.</p>
<p>He wrote, I alternate between periods</p>
<p>of two different states that vary from a few weeks</p>
<p>to a couple of months.</p>
<p>I have extremely high motivation in one state</p>
<p>where I can do multiple things,</p>
<p>side projects, making music, as well as my main things,</p>
<p>or really low motivational states</p>
<p>where I can barely do anything</p>
<p>and I only look for short-term entertainment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing short-term entertainment</p>
<p>comes in the form of video games, social media,</p>
<p>and just kind of doing generally unproductive things</p>
<p>as we all do from time to time.</p>
<p>He goes on to write,</p>
<p>what would be the best set of protocols</p>
<p>to normalize those extremes</p>
<p>into a more stable and consistent state?</p>
<p>Well, first off, this is an excellent question.</p>
<p>I say that because it&rsquo;s a question that I hear a lot.</p>
<p>And I think that many people are interested in knowing</p>
<p>how motivated they ought to feel</p>
<p>and I think a lot of people</p>
<p>also feel a lot less motivated than they would like.</p>
<p>Now, here, the question was specifically</p>
<p>about how to not go from these extremes</p>
<p>of days or weeks of high motivation</p>
<p>to days or weeks of low motivation.</p>
<p>But before we do that,</p>
<p>we need to take a step back and acknowledge</p>
<p>that just as with anxiety or happiness or sadness,</p>
<p>we as human beings don&rsquo;t have an objective window</p>
<p>into how other people experience motivation.</p>
<p>In fact, most of the time,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t even realize how we experience motivation.</p>
<p>We just know whether or not we feel a high barrier</p>
<p>or a low barrier to leaning into work</p>
<p>and getting things done.</p>
<p>In fact, I have a good friend</p>
<p>who did many years in the special operations community</p>
<p>and then went on to the finance community</p>
<p>and then now works in health and wellness community.</p>
<p>He has a great and a mental image for all of us to adopt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly one that I&rsquo;ve adopted,</p>
<p>which is for anything in our life,</p>
<p>we can either be back on our heels,</p>
<p>flat-footed or forward center of mass.</p>
<p>Back on our heels meaning really struggling,</p>
<p>flat-footed meaning that we&rsquo;re doing okay</p>
<p>or forward center of mass,</p>
<p>meaning that we feel as if we&rsquo;re really tackling things</p>
<p>and that we are in control of our environment</p>
<p>or at least to some degree.</p>
<p>So I place that imagery in your mind</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ll return to it a little bit later in the question</p>
<p>when we get into some of the underlying circuitry and tools.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I want to remind everybody</p>
<p>what the basis of motivation is.</p>
<p>There are many neurochemicals and neural circuits</p>
<p>involved in what we call motivation,</p>
<p>but a central theme of the neuroscience of motivation</p>
<p>is that the neuromodulator dopamine is involved.</p>
<p>Now dopamine does other things besides control motivation.</p>
<p>In fact, it controls light adaptation in the retina.</p>
<p>That is your eye.</p>
<p>It controls a number of different things</p>
<p>in terms of movement.</p>
<p>It controls all sorts of things,</p>
<p>but it is strongly related to the motivation pathways.</p>
<p>How do we know that?</p>
<p>Well, there are experiments on animals and humans</p>
<p>which show that even in the absence of dopamine</p>
<p>or in the presence of very low dopamine, I should say,</p>
<p>people and animals can still experience pleasure.</p>
<p>However, when dopamine levels are too low,</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s ability to pursue pleasure</p>
<p>or their willingness to pursue pleasure,</p>
<p>in particular their willingness to undergo effort</p>
<p>to pursue pleasure or any goal of any kind,</p>
<p>not just pleasure, any goal of any kind</p>
<p>is strongly regulated by the levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>So if dopamine levels are too low,</p>
<p>people simply will not put in the effort</p>
<p>to obtain or reach a goal.</p>
<p>If dopamine levels are adequately high,</p>
<p>they will put in that effort.</p>
<p>And if dopamine levels go too high,</p>
<p>you actually see something that is pathologic,</p>
<p>which is that people consider every goal a reasonable goal.</p>
<p>This is often seen in the manic phase</p>
<p>of a manic bipolar person.</p>
<p>So for instance, somebody with manic bipolar</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s in the manic episode,</p>
<p>dopamine levels are very, very high</p>
<p>and they will think every idea is a great idea</p>
<p>and they will have tons of energy to do that</p>
<p>so much so that they&rsquo;re not sleeping.</p>
<p>So obviously that&rsquo;s not what we want.</p>
<p>What we want and what the question asker Martin</p>
<p>is asking about is how to keep dopamine levels</p>
<p>in a range that allow us to lean into effort,</p>
<p>but that we don&rsquo;t expend our ability to stay motivated.</p>
<p>And we can really trace that back</p>
<p>to a biochemical slash neural circuit statement,</p>
<p>which is we really want to control our output of dopamine</p>
<p>and the baseline levels of dopamine</p>
<p>from which that output is taken.</p>
<p>In other words, we want to think about dopamine</p>
<p>as a reservoir or residing in a reservoir.</p>
<p>That reservoir can be depleted.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s exhaustible, it&rsquo;s depletable,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s renewable as well.</p>
<p>And one of the best analogies that I&rsquo;ve ever heard</p>
<p>was by a previous guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>Dr. Kyle Gillette, who&rsquo;s a medical doctor,</p>
<p>obesity specialist, expert in hormones.</p>
<p>We did a episode on optimizing hormones in males</p>
<p>with Dr. Kyle Gillette.</p>
<p>You can find that at hubermanlab.com</p>
<p>or anywhere you can find podcasts.</p>
<p>Dr. Gillette offered an analogy of the baseline levels</p>
<p>of dopamine as a wave pool.</p>
<p>And I really like this.</p>
<p>So if you think about this pool full of dopamine,</p>
<p>and here we&rsquo;re just talking about the dopamine</p>
<p>that resides in the circuits of the brain</p>
<p>that control motivation, but that pool of dopamine,</p>
<p>you can imagine is just sitting there,</p>
<p>not doing much of anything while you&rsquo;re asleep.</p>
<p>In fact, while you&rsquo;re sleeping,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re replenishing those dopamine levels.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you another tool in a moment</p>
<p>to replenish those dopamine levels.</p>
<p>But if you were to pursue a goal,</p>
<p>really, really go forward center of mass</p>
<p>for many, many hours or many, many days in some cases,</p>
<p>and pursue a goal or multiple goals,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re really driven to do a ton,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re effectively doing is generating waves</p>
<p>in that wave pool.</p>
<p>And if those waves are too big,</p>
<p>well, then the waves can&rsquo;t keep repeating themselves.</p>
<p>So think about the wave as the motivation</p>
<p>and the depth of the pool as the reservoir of dopamine.</p>
<p>And if those waves are too big, too much excitement,</p>
<p>too much motivation, too much center of mass</p>
<p>for a given period of time,</p>
<p>then the water in this wave pool sloshes out</p>
<p>of the wave pool, lowering the reservoir.</p>
<p>And then there are really three ways</p>
<p>that you can replenish that reservoir.</p>
<p>And you want to maintain or replenish that reservoir</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s been depleted.</p>
<p>How do you do that?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, quality sleep.</p>
<p>So when I say quality, I mean,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re getting enough slow wave sleep</p>
<p>and rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>So for some people, six hours, for some people, eight hours,</p>
<p>some people might even need a little bit more</p>
<p>or a little bit less.</p>
<p>We have episodes, the Perfect Your Sleep episode,</p>
<p>the Master Your Sleep episode.</p>
<p>We have a toolkit for sleep, all available at zero cost</p>
<p>at hubermanlab.com, links, et cetera.</p>
<p>So check those out for getting your sleep right.</p>
<p>But sleep is really when you replenish</p>
<p>that reservoir of dopamine.</p>
<p>So you cannot ignore sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come back to this in a moment.</p>
<p>The second science-supported tool</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really been shown to replenish dopamine,</p>
<p>in particular, dopamine within the pathways</p>
<p>that regulate motivation,</p>
<p>is a practice I&rsquo;ve talked about before on the podcast</p>
<p>called non-sleep deep rest, sometimes called yoga nidra,</p>
<p>although yoga nidra is a little bit different.</p>
<p>There are two studies out of Denmark</p>
<p>that have explored yoga nidra in the context of dopamine.</p>
<p>The first one simply involved having people</p>
<p>do a yoga nidra practice.</p>
<p>Again, this doesn&rsquo;t involve any movement,</p>
<p>but involves people, potentially you,</p>
<p>doing anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes,</p>
<p>although there are now data showing that</p>
<p>as short as 10 minutes of a non-sleep deep rest,</p>
<p>aka yoga nidra protocol,</p>
<p>leads to dramatic, really dramatic increases</p>
<p>in striatal dopamine reserves.</p>
<p>So it essentially is replenishing the dopamine reserve pool.</p>
<p>This is why I&rsquo;m such a fan of using NSDR, aka yoga nidra,</p>
<p>at least once a day, and especially under times</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re engaging in a lot of high output.</p>
<p>And when I say, especially at times</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re engaging in a lot of high output,</p>
<p>this is a mistake many people make.</p>
<p>They push, push, push, push, push.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in pursuit of a goal.</p>
<p>Then they hit that point where they&rsquo;re exhausted.</p>
<p>Then they start doing all the dopamine reserve pool,</p>
<p>replenishing tools, such as yoga nidra or NSDR.</p>
<p>The real key is to always tap off that</p>
<p>or refill that reservoir once a day</p>
<p>before it&rsquo;s completely depleted.</p>
<p>Now this gets into some of the biochemistry of dopamine</p>
<p>and the relevant circuits,</p>
<p>but it takes a lot longer to restore the dopamine reservoir.</p>
<p>Think of it still as a wave pool,</p>
<p>but that reservoir from a place of complete depletion</p>
<p>than it does of partial depletion.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an asymmetry in the way this is done.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not as if, you know, you drink a glass of water,</p>
<p>you fill the glass of water at a certain rate</p>
<p>and it fills up to a certain level and the rate is constant.</p>
<p>Think about it as once the level of dopamine</p>
<p>in your reserve is depleted past a certain point,</p>
<p>it takes a lot more effort, much more sleep,</p>
<p>much more NSDR, things of that sort</p>
<p>to replenish that reservoir.</p>
<p>Now, oftentimes what people will do</p>
<p>when they start feeling less motivation</p>
<p>is they will start relying on things like Adderall,</p>
<p>Ritalin, some cases illegal substances</p>
<p>that can increase dopamine.</p>
<p>You know what those are.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t ever lean to those.</p>
<p>They are extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>They really are because of their ability</p>
<p>to potently release dopamine.</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>Deplete that reservoir even further.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about some supplements on the podcast</p>
<p>that can replenish dopamine.</p>
<p>L-tyrosine in particular.</p>
<p>Mecunopurines is actually 99% L-DOPA,</p>
<p>the precursor to dopamine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily recommend Mecunopurines.</p>
<p>It tends to make people very dopaminergic,</p>
<p>drive, drive, drive, drive, motivated, and then crash.</p>
<p>Again, depleting that pool.</p>
<p>L-tyrosine is a little bit milder,</p>
<p>but I really encourage people to lean first</p>
<p>on the behavioral tools such as NSDR.</p>
<p>And by the way, there&rsquo;s a NSDR script,</p>
<p>totally zero cost that you can find</p>
<p>by putting my name and NSDR into YouTube.</p>
<p>That one works quite well</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re looking for a short NSDR.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some other NSDRs.</p>
<p>You can simply look on the internet or YouTube</p>
<p>and just put NSDR and you&rsquo;ll find NSDR.</p>
<p>Or if you prefer to do</p>
<p>the more classic yoga nidra type approach,</p>
<p>there are a lot of different yoga nidra options</p>
<p>to choose from on YouTube.</p>
<p>Many people think NSDR or yoga nidra</p>
<p>are simply meditation with a body scan.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Meditation is a focus exercise.</p>
<p>Okay, most meditations are focus exercise.</p>
<p>NSDR restores energy through the dopamine system</p>
<p>and newer data are starting to show</p>
<p>that it can actually recover lost sleep.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re not sleeping enough.</p>
<p>But to return to NSDR, aka yoga nidra as a practice,</p>
<p>yes, it&rsquo;s been shown in laboratory studies,</p>
<p>in humans, by the way, to restore dopamine levels.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another study lesser known</p>
<p>from that same group that was published in 2011,</p>
<p>which is entitled Dopaminergic Stimulation</p>
<p>Enhances Confidence and Accuracy</p>
<p>in Seeing Rapidly Presented Words.</p>
<p>This was a cognitive task.</p>
<p>They explored yoga nidra, aka NSDR,</p>
<p>in the context of increasing striatal dopamine.</p>
<p>They already knew that it did that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>They confirmed that result.</p>
<p>But what they also found is that doing NSDR</p>
<p>could restore confidence in cognitive ability</p>
<p>and performance in these cognitive tasks.</p>
<p>Okay, so this is a really powerful zero cost tool</p>
<p>for re-upping or replenishing that dopamine reserve.</p>
<p>Okay, so this is something to do every day,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re not feeling depleted.</p>
<p>So the question again was about how to make sure</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t go through these cycles</p>
<p>of extreme motivation and then lesser motivation.</p>
<p>Well, get your sleep right.</p>
<p>I would say 80% or more of the nights of your life,</p>
<p>hopefully the nights that it&rsquo;s not good</p>
<p>or for good reasons that you&rsquo;re enjoying yourself,</p>
<p>but hey, life happens.</p>
<p>So 100% of the time is just not reasonable</p>
<p>to expect of yourself.</p>
<p>Do NSDR once a day for either 10 minutes.</p>
<p>If you have the time to do 20, 30 minutes or an hour,</p>
<p>you will see even more positive effects.</p>
<p>It has been shown in these research studies</p>
<p>to replenish dopamine, levels of confidence,</p>
<p>cognitive ability, et cetera, and sense of motivation.</p>
<p>And I said there were three tools.</p>
<p>And the third tool that really can allow you</p>
<p>to keep the dopamine, aka motivation circuitry</p>
<p>tuned up properly is to really start paying attention</p>
<p>to peaks in dopamine and be very careful</p>
<p>about layering in too many things</p>
<p>that can stimulate the dopamine system.</p>
<p>I talked about this quite a bit in the episode</p>
<p>that we did on ADHD and building and maintaining focus.</p>
<p>There are many things out there nowadays</p>
<p>that will deplete the dopamine system.</p>
<p>For instance, and by the way,</p>
<p>none of what I&rsquo;m about to list is necessarily bad.</p>
<p>I actually use some of these things.</p>
<p>For instance, caffeine will increase dopamine receptors</p>
<p>that will allow whatever dopamine is available</p>
<p>to be more potent.</p>
<p>Okay, so caffeine&rsquo;s great for some people,</p>
<p>less good for people with anxiety.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t drink it too late in the day</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll interfere with your sleep</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>But many people will combine caffeine</p>
<p>with music that they particularly like.</p>
<p>Music&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Music can stimulate dopamine release.</p>
<p>We know this.</p>
<p>It can enhance motivation,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s the kind of music</p>
<p>that really puts you in the groove</p>
<p>for the particular type of work you&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>For me, I like to listen to either loud, fast music</p>
<p>or Glenn Gould classical piano.</p>
<p>So one or the other.</p>
<p>I know what&rsquo;s right for me for a given time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll know what&rsquo;s right for you</p>
<p>for a given time in your preferences.</p>
<p>But what will happen is people will start consuming caffeine</p>
<p>at higher and higher levels.</p>
<p>Again, caffeine isn&rsquo;t necessarily bad,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ll start doing that</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll start layering it in</p>
<p>or stacking very potent music, potent for them,</p>
<p>plus things like L-tyrosine.</p>
<p>Again, none of these things are terrible on their own.</p>
<p>In fact, they can be very beneficial.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;ll start taking mucuna purine.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;ll start relying on things</p>
<p>like Adderall, Ritalin.</p>
<p>And pretty soon what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re getting these big waves</p>
<p>in that dopamine wave pool, big peaks.</p>
<p>And within a few days, or maybe even within a few hours,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re depleted and they&rsquo;re at that low.</p>
<p>And then as Dr. Anna Lembke,</p>
<p>who was a guest on the podcast,</p>
<p>talked about in terms of addiction,</p>
<p>but also in her wonderful book, Dopamine Nation,</p>
<p>what happens is after those big peaks in dopamine,</p>
<p>the reservoir, the baseline in dopamine</p>
<p>drops below its initial level.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s as if the reservoir got deeper and it&rsquo;s emptier</p>
<p>and it takes much, much longer to fill.</p>
<p>Okay, so to be quite specific,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m recommending is get your sleep right,</p>
<p>ideally every night of your life,</p>
<p>but for as many nights of your life as possible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s clearly replenishing dopamine</p>
<p>and sense of motivation.</p>
<p>Do all the things associated with that.</p>
<p>Morning sunlight, lack of artificial light</p>
<p>at certain hours of the night, et cetera.</p>
<p>All of that&rsquo;s in the toolkit for sleep</p>
<p>and other episodes I mentioned before.</p>
<p>Have a practice that is research supported</p>
<p>to replenish dopamine and incorporate that practice</p>
<p>any time of day.</p>
<p>Again, NSDR can be done morning, afternoon, or evening,</p>
<p>or middle of the night if you wake up</p>
<p>and you need to get back to sleep,</p>
<p>it can be very beneficial for that.</p>
<p>But do it as a consistent practice</p>
<p>so that dopamine reservoir remains tapped off.</p>
<p>And as a third point, please be wary of,</p>
<p>or at least aware of these peaks in dopamine</p>
<p>and the fact that layering in a lot of things</p>
<p>that stimulate dopamine,</p>
<p>while that can be wonderful for your wedding,</p>
<p>a birth of a new child,</p>
<p>going to a sports event with a bunch of friends,</p>
<p>celebrating a big anniversary.</p>
<p>Yes, please do celebrate and enjoy</p>
<p>the wonderful events of life.</p>
<p>But please also understand and expect there will be a lull,</p>
<p>a sort of postpartum low,</p>
<p>maybe not full-blown depression that follows that</p>
<p>unless you incorporate some tools and practices</p>
<p>to replenish that dopamine.</p>
<p>Does that mean you should never combine</p>
<p>caffeine, L-tyrosine, music,</p>
<p>and a workout in time with friends?</p>
<p>No, absolutely not.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t expect to do that</p>
<p>and then go do an intense bout of work</p>
<p>and then get up the next morning and do it all over again</p>
<p>for more than a few days</p>
<p>before you find yourself pretty depleted.</p>
<p>Okay, so rather than give you a specific schedule of,</p>
<p>you know, do seven days of this and four days of this,</p>
<p>what I encourage you to do is for at least five days a week,</p>
<p>maybe give yourself some time off on the weekends,</p>
<p>maybe not, but for at least five days a week,</p>
<p>get into a consistent routine that is,</p>
<p>I should say, neurobiologically consistent as well</p>
<p>with how the dopamine,</p>
<p>aka circuits that control motivation work.</p>
<p>And I assure you that you will find yourself</p>
<p>in a more regular groove of focus and attention</p>
<p>and alertness and motivation when you need to.</p>
<p>And provided you&rsquo;re doing all the things I described</p>
<p>and hopefully paying attention to other things</p>
<p>like nutrition and social connection too, of course,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find a much more even pattern</p>
<p>of motivation over time.</p>
<p>One last thing before I conclude</p>
<p>the answer to this question.</p>
<p>When I was in graduate school,</p>
<p>I got some wonderful advice from an excellent neurologist.</p>
<p>His name is Robert Knight.</p>
<p>He used to be at University of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s retired now,</p>
<p>but is still active in the scientific community.</p>
<p>And I asked him what he was doing that weekend.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why this came up.</p>
<p>And he said, oh, I&rsquo;m going fishing.</p>
<p>I like kind of, you know, mindless recreation.</p>
<p>I said, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>You know, fishing&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not particularly into fishing myself,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve done it a few times and I enjoy it.</p>
<p>And he said, you know, the most important thing</p>
<p>for a science or medicine career or any demanding career.</p>
<p>I said, what?</p>
<p>Like I was all ears.</p>
<p>I was super, you know, super hungry to get in the mix</p>
<p>and, you know, do research and publish papers.</p>
<p>And he said, figure out how many hours a day</p>
<p>you can do real work consistently.</p>
<p>That means five days a week.</p>
<p>For some people, six or seven, but five days a week,</p>
<p>I think for most people is going to be a bit healthier</p>
<p>overall for your social life and family, et cetera.</p>
<p>And he said, figure that out and know that that number</p>
<p>is what you should apply over and over and over again,</p>
<p>but update that number about every four or five years.</p>
<p>And I said, okay, so does that mean that over time</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working more and more or less and less?</p>
<p>And he said, ah, here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>As you get better at your profession,</p>
<p>you will find that you can do more potent work,</p>
<p>more directed work in a shorter amount of time,</p>
<p>but that does not mean that you can continue to expand</p>
<p>the amount of time that you&rsquo;re doing focused work.</p>
<p>In fact, the opposite.</p>
<p>So this follows a sort of general principle</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also present in resistance training,</p>
<p>you know, weightlifting, right?</p>
<p>The analogy there is that people always imagine</p>
<p>that as you get better and better at resistance training,</p>
<p>you should do more and more volume,</p>
<p>just keep adding volume.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some evidence to support that,</p>
<p>more volume for hypertrophy as opposed to less, et cetera.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done episodes on this.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s a different school of thought</p>
<p>that works exceedingly well,</p>
<p>and it runs in the exact opposite direction,</p>
<p>which is as you get better</p>
<p>at controlling muscular contractions,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s say for in an endurance sport,</p>
<p>as you get better at regulating your stride and breathing</p>
<p>and all those things,</p>
<p>you actually can do more quote-unquote</p>
<p>adaptation stimulating damage</p>
<p>during a given training session.</p>
<p>So you want to train less, not more over time</p>
<p>because beginners don&rsquo;t actually have the ability</p>
<p>to get much done in a lot of time</p>
<p>or a short period of time,</p>
<p>whereas experts can come in there and really nail it.</p>
<p>So I think that advice that Robert Knight was really key,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;ve followed throughout my career.</p>
<p>So at one period of my life,</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t mention the hours that I worked in graduate school.</p>
<p>They were pretty insane, to be honest.</p>
<p>I had family members get a little concerned.</p>
<p>I actually lived in the laboratory,</p>
<p>even as a junior professor.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t suggest people do that by the way,</p>
<p>but I enjoyed it at the time.</p>
<p>And the key thing is that you figure out</p>
<p>what you can do consistently</p>
<p>and still maintain mental health and physical health.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s key as well, and do that.</p>
<p>And then every couple of years or so,</p>
<p>update that typically by reducing the total amount of time</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing that high potency work.</p>
<p>I think that combined with the other tools</p>
<p>that I described before</p>
<p>for generating ongoing dopaminergic circuits,</p>
<p>keeping that reservoir full</p>
<p>ought to give you consistent motivation.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s an art and a practice and a science,</p>
<p>so don&rsquo;t expect to get it perfect the first time around,</p>
<p>but I wish you all luck,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m certain that these tools work.</p>

<p>but through all channels,</p>
<p>Huberman Lab Podcast and other media channels.</p>
<p>So the idea here is to give you information</p>
<p>to your burning questions in depth</p>
<p>and allow you the opportunity</p>
<p>to support the kind of research</p>
<p>that provides those kinds of answers in the first place.</p>
<p>Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel</p>
<p>is that the tiny foundation has generously offered</p>
<p>to do a dollar for dollar match</p>
<p>on all funds raised for research</p>
<p>through the premium channel.</p>
<p>So this is a terrific way that they&rsquo;re going to amplify</p>
<p>whatever funds come in through the premium channel</p>
<p>to further support research</p>
<p>for science and science-related tools</p>
<p>for mental health, physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to sign up</p>
<p>for the Huberman Lab premium channel,</p>
<p>again, there&rsquo;s a cost of $10 per month,</p>
<p>or you can pay $100 upfront for the entire year.</p>
<p>That will give you access to all the AMAs.</p>
<p>You can ask questions and get answers to your questions.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll, of course, get answers to all the questions</p>
<p>that other people ask as well.</p>
<p>There will also be some premium content</p>
<p>such as transcripts of the AMAs</p>
<p>and various transcripts and protocols</p>
<p>of Huberman Lab Podcast episodes not found elsewhere.</p>
<p>And again, you&rsquo;ll be supporting research</p>
<p>for mental health, physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>You can sign up for the premium channel</p>
<p>by going to HubermanLab.com slash premium.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s HubermanLab.com slash premium.</p>
<p>And as always, thank you for your interest in science.</p>
