    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>I would like to welcome everyone to this very special bonus content episode with myself,</p>
<p>Jennifer.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m Angie.</p>
<p>We call her Pumps of I&rsquo;ve Had It Podcast.</p>
<p>And for those of you that follow us on Instagram, you may have seen several days ago where Pumps</p>
<p>reveals to me that she has been feeding her dog grapes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>First of all, backup.</p>
<p>I did say he liked grapes.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say I was feeding him to him all the time.</p>
<p>I did get some grapes.</p>
<p>I gave him one because he was bugging me about it.</p>
<p>And I thought, well, he&rsquo;s not going to want this.</p>
<p>And then he liked him.</p>
<p>It was on one occasion.</p>
<p>And I gave him probably 10 or something, but that was two weeks ago.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not dying.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Thank you for confirming what I just said.</p>
<p>I know, but you make it sound like I feed him that all the time.</p>
<p>Like, hey, wake up.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s your grapes.</p>
<p>Listener, as I was saying, we aired on Instagram that Pumps likes to feed her dog grapes.</p>
<p>And I knew that the internet would go bananas, as the internet always does, especially when</p>
<p>it involves the health, safety, and well-being of one of our little furry friends.</p>
<p>And those of you that have followed us for many years know that I am a fucking five-star</p>
<p>pet owner.</p>
<p>I crush it.</p>
<p>You might even be jacked up to fucking crazy-ass pet owner.</p>
<p>Like I said, I crush it in the pet-owning department.</p>
<p>Pumps struggles.</p>
<p>I struggled with one dog.</p>
<p>You are a terrible pet owner.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lie.</p>
<p>And when I posted this about you feeding the dog grapes to get the internet in a frenzy,</p>
<p>it worked like a charm.</p>
<p>And I just want to share with the listener one of the comments that came in.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s from 1K Davis.</p>
<p>And she says, I remember watching her with her dogs on TV, and I thought, that woman</p>
<p>should not have dogs ever.</p>
<p>The grapes further confirmed my thoughts.</p>
<p>To which I automatically responded, cap lock, exactly.</p>
<p>I could bore you and the listener by going through all several hundred of these comments</p>
<p>that confirm that you&rsquo;re a bad pet owner, that you shouldn&rsquo;t feed your dog grapes, but</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to belabor the point.</p>
<p>I know you would hate that, but I just want to go on record.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a terrible pet owner.</p>
<p>I walk him every day at least a mile, hopefully two.</p>
<p>He gets ice water.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t like tap water.</p>
<p>He likes it to be cold.</p>
<p>So he gets ice water.</p>
<p>He sleeps with me.</p>
<p>We hang out all the time.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not a terrible pet owner.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, there are some things that I could point out, like the time that your other</p>
<p>dog ran away and you celebrated it, and then it ran back home, and you were just pissed</p>
<p>that it came back home, and then you kind of like encouraged it to run away again and</p>
<p>then celebrated that.</p>
<p>I did not like that dog.</p>
<p>He made Blaze crazy.</p>
<p>He made me crazy.</p>
<p>I could not be happier that he has found a new home.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know that he&rsquo;s found a new home.</p>
<p>Yes, we do, because he&rsquo;s chipped.</p>
<p>The people called me from the vet, but they didn&rsquo;t want to leave.</p>
<p>They wanted to do like no caller ID, so my phone never rang.</p>
<p>And so they have him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s chipped.</p>
<p>He could bring him home if they want.</p>
<p>So you do know for a fact, true serum and a polygraph, that that dog is with a family?</p>
<p>Well, no, I don&rsquo;t know exactly with a polygraph, but wouldn&rsquo;t they notify me if he died?</p>
<p>He ran away the second time.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t know where he went.</p>
<p>But anyway, this is-</p>
<p>I think he went back to the same people who had him the first time.</p>
<p>Operative word there, think.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s life is easier that Scout is out of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just, I&rsquo;m going to stand on that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, if anybody would like to weigh in on at I&rsquo;ve Had It Instagram about the orphan</p>
<p>that used to be Pumps&rsquo; dog, please feel free to do so.</p>
<p>Until then, let&rsquo;s have Kylie play for us the comments from you, the listener, telling us</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>The first one is Samantha D.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with old people.</p>
<p>I love old people, but who the fuck gave them cell phones?</p>
<p>They go to restaurants, they turn everything on their speakerphone, they play games.</p>
<p>If I hear this bitch in the restaurant pop one more bubble on her game, I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>lose my mind.</p>
<p>First of all, I love Samantha&rsquo;s accent.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Rock solid.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it funny?</p>
<p>I mean, these cell phone etiquette is a problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge problem, and I think the boomers are some of the biggest offenders.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was thinking more the younger, but it probably is the boomers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the boomers.</p>
<p>The younger people don&rsquo;t want to ever draw attention to themselves.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kind of buried in their phones, but it&rsquo;s not noisy, they&rsquo;ve got earpods in.</p>
<p>These boomers are awful at technology and at phones.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The speakerphone, anytime you&rsquo;re in public, you can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>It is terrible.</p>
<p>Samantha, I could not agree more.</p>
<p>And I love, especially love how you started off the, I&rsquo;ve had it with, I&rsquo;ve had it with</p>
<p>these old people, comma, I love old people.</p>
<p>That kind of crazy contradiction, I get that with every group, because I kind of like have</p>
<p>totally had it with boomers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sick to death of them.</p>
<p>But there are several boomers that I obviously love, like pumps.</p>
<p>You are the biggest bitch on planet earth, and I&rsquo;m not even lying.</p>
<p>When you turn 50, I can&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m going to take the next two years figuring out how I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to torture you.</p>
<p>No, actually the next 18 months.</p>
<p>Do you know what&rsquo;s going to be so great about when I turn 50?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still going to be older.</p>
<p>I know, but I mean, look how good I look for 60.</p>
<p>For those of you that are just tuning in, pumps is actually very much older than me.</p>
<p>Four years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not very much.</p>
<p>Are you 52?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 52.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll be 53 at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Oh, so it&rsquo;s four and a half years.</p>
<p>Only for six months.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at four and a half years.</p>
<p>It would always be four and a half years.</p>
<p>No, but I&rsquo;m just saying normally it&rsquo;s just four years.</p>
<p>Right now it&rsquo;s four and a half, but once August rolls around, it&rsquo;ll just be four years again.</p>
<p>No, but the timeframe, the four months would always be the same.</p>
<p>No, I know.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just saying that you&rsquo;re not that much younger than me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care how the math clicks out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care how the math clicks out.</p>
<p>This is a true statement.</p>
<p>Jennifer is younger than pumps.</p>
<p>That is true, but this is a true statement.</p>
<p>Angie is so much nicer and prettier than Jennifer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably true.</p>
<p>That probably is true.</p>
<p>Samantha, I agree with you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with the speakerphone calls and I&rsquo;ve kind of had it with boomers and how dumb</p>
<p>they are on Facebook.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, you know, they&rsquo;re all juiced up on Fox News and Tucker Carlson ready to like</p>
<p>light the world on fire.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Agree.</p>
<p>You ready for the next one?</p>
<p>Ready for the next one.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re really going to like this one, Jennifer.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Pumps, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to like it at all.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is Ashley H.</p>
<p>I have had it with Stanley Cups.</p>
<p>I was talking to a mom at drop off and I asked her what she got for her birthday and she</p>
<p>said a Stanley Cup and I didn&rsquo;t know what they were at the time and I asked her, you</p>
<p>must really be into hockey then and she laughed at me and showed me an Instagram feed of people</p>
<p>with their Stanley Cups.</p>
<p>A sippy cup is not a fashion accessory.</p>
<p>I have had it.</p>
<p>Guilty and I&rsquo;m just going to go on record that the Stanley Cup is the greatest invention</p>
<p>of all time over electricity, automobiles.</p>
<p>It is the single greatest invention of our day.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go turn off all the breakers at your house.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m going to take your car keys.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m going to leave you inside that house with your fucking Stanley Cup.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also going to have your cell phone too since you know electricity and we&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>how long you love that Stanley Cup.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s funny that people are so dramatically opposed to the Stanley Cup.</p>
<p>For the record, I took two pictures last week at basketball games, both of them I had my</p>
<p>Stanley Cup in it.</p>
<p>Thanks for letting me and the listener know about your photographic habits.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with the Stanley Cups.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with people constantly having to put a beverage in their mouth all the time</p>
<p>and take it with them everywhere.</p>
<p>What happened where we could sit down, have a drink, have something to eat, then get up</p>
<p>like normal people and abstain from drinking or eating for like 30, 45 minutes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that big of an ask.</p>
<p>It is just not that big of an ask to ask people to quit schlepping their goddamn Stanley Cups</p>
<p>and slurping on them in the lipstick stains.</p>
<p>I have had it up to my eyeballs from top to bottom.</p>
<p>Fuck you, Stanley.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I love Stanley.</p>
<p>Love Stanley.</p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just so fantastic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it that people cannot go an hour without consuming something.</p>
<p>It disgusts me.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re such a fucking bitch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>Did you hear that real good?</p>
<p>I was out of my Stanley.</p>
<p>Oh my God, Ashley, I&rsquo;m with you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with you.</p>
<p>I think on your 50th birthday, I&rsquo;ll try to get you a big round of Stanleys.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Kylie, who&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got Molly P.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hello, ladies.</p>
<p>The things that I have had it with are pajama pants with the shower shoes and socks in public.</p>
<p>No one wants to see that.</p>
<p>Obviously you haven&rsquo;t washed your ash for the day and it&rsquo;s just the slobification of</p>
<p>America.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Goodbye.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great one.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I completely agree.</p>
<p>I completely agree with the slobification of America.</p>
<p>We were just talking about that in the last I&rsquo;ve had it, the one prior to you where everybody</p>
<p>has to carry a goddamn giant beverage around with them all the time in their pajamas, which</p>
<p>pumps has no issue going out in public in her pajamas and she wears slippers all the</p>
<p>time to the filming of this podcast.</p>
<p>She can&rsquo;t even put on normal shoes.</p>
<p>Today you have a normal shoes, but I mean, a lot of times you&rsquo;re in your slippers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wear my slippers out, but I&rsquo;m like, if I come here or I mean, I&rsquo;m not like</p>
<p>going to the mall in my slippers and pajama pants.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;ve never done it because I&rsquo;m sure I have at some point, but</p>
<p>I do notice when the kid, when my kids wear pajama bottoms and the slides with socks,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always asking him like, why weren&rsquo;t you just get dressed?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My son Dylan, he wears, he&rsquo;ll wear like pajama bottoms out.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just like, what do I do as a parent?</p>
<p>How do I end this?</p>
<p>Because you know, you have to pick your battles because I&rsquo;m like, okay, it&rsquo;s really not that</p>
<p>big of a deal.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a good person.</p>
<p>He makes good grades.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But I mean, sometimes I just want to be like, pull yourself together.</p>
<p>Well, but I think a lot of them that age do that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like normal.</p>
<p>Like they go somewhere and everybody&rsquo;s in pajama bottoms.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re running up to seven 11.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give that a pass.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>The airport?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, there are people wearing pajamas on airplanes now.</p>
<p>And it all started when the airlines quit dressing the flight attendants cute.</p>
<p>They used to have these cute skirts and little cute hats and they kind of had these little,</p>
<p>you know, like little scarves around their necks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just gone downhill since they&rsquo;ve taken away the cute airline stewardess outfits.</p>
<p>Flight attendant.</p>
<p>Flight attendant.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s okay for flight attendants to call them a stewardess?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t keep up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>I do like this.</p>
<p>She said this about the bat.</p>
<p>That was funny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s a mental picture I don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Thanks for reminding us pumps.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Kylie, who&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>The last one is from Rachel.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I have had it with these bicycle posses.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a ginormous group of people riding bicycles just in the road.</p>
<p>You have a bike lane.</p>
<p>Why are you in the middle of the road?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that the tight pants and the seat going up the crack of their ass is messing</p>
<p>with their brain power.</p>
<p>Someone help them please.</p>
<p>Rachel, I completely agree.</p>
<p>And I almost got into a huge fight with a bicyclist.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m driving to a hair appointment.</p>
<p>And listener, I hate being late.</p>
<p>Like it stresses me out.</p>
<p>I would rather be 30 minutes early than two minutes late.</p>
<p>Like it completely stresses me out if I&rsquo;m running late because I take into account the</p>
<p>person&rsquo;s feelings that I&rsquo;m meeting.</p>
<p>So unlike other people that co-host a podcast with me, that&rsquo;s neither here nor there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m driving down the road and there&rsquo;s a bicyclist.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably a posse of them.</p>
<p>And so nobody&rsquo;s coming in the oncoming lane.</p>
<p>So I go around them, hit a red light.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re kind of at this point kind of catching up.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m about to make a right turn.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;m turning, the guy that I passed is so mad at me, I guess because I passed</p>
<p>him, but I passed him legally.</p>
<p>He hits my car, yeah, with his hand, not the bike, but he like, as he passes, he slaps</p>
<p>my car and he&rsquo;s like, fuck you.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just like, okay, first and foremost, this is what happens when you get on the road,</p>
<p>motherfucker.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You get passed.</p>
<p>Sometimes you pass people, sometimes you get passed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a part of driving.</p>
<p>And if you enter the road on a bike, sometimes you&rsquo;re going to get passed and sometimes you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to do the passing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>Why on earth this motherfucker was so butthurt that I passed him, I just, I don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand that either.</p>
<p>And I think the biggest issue in regard to the bicyclers is when men wear those stupid</p>
<p>bike shorts and their package, like you can see it from the bike and I&rsquo;m just like, disgusting.</p>
<p>Those should be outlawed.</p>
<p>Pump the brakes.</p>
<p>You can see their package from the bike?</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re stopped at a stop sign, they like put their feet on the ground or one foot</p>
<p>on the ground.</p>
<p>And I look back and it&rsquo;s just like a row of like men in bike shorts, which is just gross.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not answering my question.</p>
<p>I mean, do I see their wieners?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The outline.</p>
<p>The package.</p>
<p>You see the outline of the package.</p>
<p>Yes, you can see the outline of the package.</p>
<p>So the answer to your question is yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Next question is when you see men on bikes, you&rsquo;re looking in between their legs.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m looking in my rear view mirror to make sure I&rsquo;m not going to run over one.</p>
<p>And I noticed they&rsquo;re standing there and they have this bulge.</p>
<p>And you see the package in the rear view mirror.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I&rsquo;ve never noticed this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>At stop signs, they&rsquo;ll like hop off.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re probably, maybe there&rsquo;s some well hung cyclists around you or something.</p>
<p>You know what I should have done when I saw that is ask for his number.</p>
<p>I mean, look at Eagle Eye over here sniffing out penis sizes of the cyclists.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it was big or small.</p>
<p>I just thought, why the fuck are you wearing that?</p>
<p>Like it looks terrible.</p>
<p>I wear those because it&rsquo;s the friction of the seats back and forth.</p>
<p>It makes perfect sense why they wear them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, why does a scuba diver wear the scuba suit?</p>
<p>And because your thighs are rubbing back and forth on that seat.</p>
<p>So you want the fabric to be taut.</p>
<p>That to me makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>I just think it looks awful.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I just didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know you were such a package girl, but you know, I just run around all day looking</p>
<p>for bicyclists.</p>
<p>You learn stuff about people every day.</p>
<p>Even people you&rsquo;ve been friends with for 25 years.</p>
<p>You learn new stuff about them.</p>
<p>Watch the bicyclers at a stop sign.</p>
<p>Everyone will notice.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m going to.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good tip.</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>What about the girls?</p>
<p>Can they wear the tight breeches?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s just like short legging.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just the penis that offends you.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Just the package.</p>
<p>Like, ugh.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to see that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I honestly have never seen it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have to run around to the bike lanes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Get your binoculars, eagle eye.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll spot them out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe we can write a report and submit it here on at I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Good idea.</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;ve started doing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a total Gen Xer move.</p>
<p>Instead of saying I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast, I&rsquo;m saying the Instagram name at I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re so much younger than me.</p>
<p>I just call it I&rsquo;ve Had It.</p>
<p>At pumps, pumps, pumps.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Without further ado, I think this will conclude our bonus content.</p>
<p>If you would like to be featured with some petty grievance that you have, please DM us</p>
<p>a voice memo to at I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast on Instagram.</p>
<p>And also, please take time to go to our Instagram page and talk to pumps about being a good</p>
<p>pet owner.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I hate you.</p>
<p>I literally hate you.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>I hate you.</p>
<p>See you next Tuesday.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
