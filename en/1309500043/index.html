    <p>hi friends how are you</p>
<p>today i hope you&rsquo;re having a wonderful day so far</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s monday</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s murder mystery and makeup monday</p>
<p>if you are new here hi welcome my name is bailey</p>
<p>sarian and on</p>
<p>mondays i sit down and i talk about a true crime</p>
<p>story that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>heavy on my</p>
<p>knock in and i do my makeup</p>
<p>at the same time if you&rsquo;re interested in true</p>
<p>crime and you like makeup i</p>
<p>would highly suggest you hit that subscribe button</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;m here for you on mondays</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get into today&rsquo;s</p>
<p>story today&rsquo;s</p>
<p>story does involve satanism</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s story is not a reflection of the</p>
<p>whole satanism</p>
<p>religion you know like we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>adults here we could separate the two</p>
<p>i just have to say that because it</p>
<p>never fails whenever a religion is mentioned</p>
<p>they think that i&rsquo;m suggesting that it represents the</p>
<p>whole religion and i</p>
<p>i am not we&rsquo;re separating the two</p>
<p>right i forget to mention that in a lot of</p>
<p>these stories and i need to remember that because it</p>
<p>never fails</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s bad seeds no matter</p>
<p>where you look</p>
<p>shawn sellers</p>
<p>talk about him</p>
<p>have you heard of him well let me tell you</p>
<p>drama drama</p>
<p>drama because</p>
<p>he was like the youngest guy to ever be</p>
<p>executed in the united</p>
<p>states and i&rsquo;m totally jumping</p>
<p>ahead but that&rsquo;s why the</p>
<p>story is like wow</p>
<p>so who shawn sellers let me tell you</p>
<p>shawn sellers was born in california on may 18th 1969</p>
<p>shawn&rsquo;s mom her name was wanda</p>
<p>now she was only 16 when she had him</p>
<p>and his biological father was said to be very unstable</p>
<p>and a bit of an alcoholic</p>
<p>but at the age of three sean&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother and father they ended up</p>
<p>separating and then vonda</p>
<p>quickly met a new man</p>
<p>who was a truck driver named lee</p>
<p>his real name&rsquo;s paul but they called him lee</p>
<p>so lee okay</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a truck driver cool they meet and</p>
<p>after meeting the two of them just ran off together</p>
<p>got married</p>
<p>and shawn&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother left</p>
<p>shawn behind with his</p>
<p>grandparents in oklahoma</p>
<p>now shawn&rsquo;s mother and</p>
<p>stepfather would spend</p>
<p>their time driving across the country</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>would stop by</p>
<p>every so often like</p>
<p>every few weeks to visit</p>
<p>sean so at the age of</p>
<p>eight sean&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother and stepfather they</p>
<p>ended up moving to los angeles</p>
<p>and they took sean with them</p>
<p>so he went from living</p>
<p>in a small town</p>
<p>with his grandparents</p>
<p>in oklahoma remember</p>
<p>and now he&rsquo;s moving or he</p>
<p>moved to los angeles</p>
<p>where he said it was a lot more hectic and</p>
<p>they went into the</p>
<p>small apartment so it was just a really</p>
<p>rough adjustment</p>
<p>sean said though he was</p>
<p>happy because he was living with his mom</p>
<p>again and also with lee</p>
<p>who sean considered his father</p>
<p>by the time sean was 16 he had</p>
<p>moved around 30 different</p>
<p>times so he&rsquo;s jumping around from town to town</p>
<p>for reasons related to his parents jobs</p>
<p>i was rough because sean was</p>
<p>never able to make friends have a</p>
<p>stable home</p>
<p>you know if he liked a</p>
<p>place he knew like he couldn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>attached to it or get comfortable because they</p>
<p>would probably be moving again</p>
<p>like 30 times is wild</p>
<p>but over time sean just stopped trying to make friends</p>
<p>and preferred just being</p>
<p>alone because what was the</p>
<p>point they were just</p>
<p>gonna move again</p>
<p>sean would say that in the family</p>
<p>household he</p>
<p>would suffer beatings from his</p>
<p>mother as well as from his grandfather</p>
<p>when he was living with him</p>
<p>and then there was a</p>
<p>short period of time when</p>
<p>sean was living with his uncle</p>
<p>and this uncle</p>
<p>did not like that shawn</p>
<p>would wet the bed at</p>
<p>night so he would</p>
<p>force him to wear</p>
<p>diapers when he went to bed i</p>
<p>guess that&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>right normally like</p>
<p>they wet the bed wear diaper</p>
<p>nights but shawn was around the</p>
<p>age of 12 13 years old</p>
<p>so this was just humiliating</p>
<p>to him shawn</p>
<p>would say that if he wet the bed two</p>
<p>nights in a row the</p>
<p>uncle would</p>
<p>force shawn to wear the soil diaper</p>
<p>on his head</p>
<p>for the day so that</p>
<p>uncle&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>not right you know</p>
<p>shawn would say that he was a pretty</p>
<p>intense guy like he</p>
<p>would take shawn</p>
<p>hunting and</p>
<p>teach him how to kill</p>
<p>the animals by doing certain techniques i won&rsquo;t go into</p>
<p>graphic detail</p>
<p>but he would</p>
<p>teach him how to kill the animals and sean</p>
<p>would say that he</p>
<p>would watch his uncle</p>
<p>kill animals in a pretty brutal way and if sean was</p>
<p>grossed out at all or like didn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>watch or participate the</p>
<p>uncle would make fun of</p>
<p>him calling him a wimp telling him that he&rsquo;s pathetic</p>
<p>and was just really mean</p>
<p>he sounded like a real awful guy</p>
<p>so it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>until his family</p>
<p>moved to colorado</p>
<p>that the now</p>
<p>teenage sean felt</p>
<p>happy for the</p>
<p>first time when they</p>
<p>moved there</p>
<p>he was going to</p>
<p>school and he joined the</p>
<p>civil air patrol</p>
<p>and he had been</p>
<p>studying emergency response</p>
<p>training which he</p>
<p>would eventually</p>
<p>graduate from the program with outstanding</p>
<p>honors sean&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother and stepfather they really took notice</p>
<p>to him being passionate</p>
<p>about something and him</p>
<p>really applying himself</p>
<p>towards this new interest</p>
<p>and they made him</p>
<p>really proud they were very</p>
<p>proud of shawn</p>
<p>he was just doing really well it was</p>
<p>clear to them that</p>
<p>their quiet well</p>
<p>behaved son</p>
<p>was finally like coming out of his shell a bit</p>
<p>teachers at the high</p>
<p>school shawn was attending</p>
<p>knew him as a good student who loved</p>
<p>comic books and</p>
<p>he had a talent for drawing</p>
<p>shawn wasn&rsquo;t popular</p>
<p>by any means he had</p>
<p>like a few friends but for the most part he really just</p>
<p>enjoyed learning pretty good kid</p>
<p>many of his</p>
<p>teachers noted</p>
<p>that sean absolutely</p>
<p>loved reading</p>
<p>and that he almost always</p>
<p>had his nose in a book</p>
<p>bookworm again</p>
<p>in colorado</p>
<p>it was just like</p>
<p>day and night</p>
<p>shawn just seemed like a different person</p>
<p>he was finding himself he seemed</p>
<p>happy and he just seemed to really be doing well in</p>
<p>school right</p>
<p>things are great he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happy yay and then</p>
<p>things changed</p>
<p>not long after moving to</p>
<p>colorado you know</p>
<p>shawn&rsquo;s getting all settled in he&rsquo;s doing well</p>
<p>his parents notified him or informed him</p>
<p>that they would be moving again</p>
<p>this time they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going back to oklahoma</p>
<p>so for obvious reasons</p>
<p>like sean is</p>
<p>devastated by this news he finally</p>
<p>found somewhere that he belonged he&rsquo;s doing well he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>succeeding in life he has</p>
<p>hobbies he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>doing well he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want to go and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s trying</p>
<p>to convince his parents to just let him stay like</p>
<p>for the first time in my life</p>
<p>things are doing well please just let me stay</p>
<p>shawn&rsquo;s parents knew that there&rsquo;s no way that they</p>
<p>could leave</p>
<p>their 15 year old alone</p>
<p>in colorado when they</p>
<p>moved to oklahoma so unfortunately</p>
<p>they had to move and</p>
<p>they did so they headed back to oklahoma city</p>
<p>and then after they moved</p>
<p>shawn&rsquo;s attitude</p>
<p>changed he was</p>
<p>angry he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>teenager for</p>
<p>starter so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not good because they&rsquo;re usually a little</p>
<p>angry already</p>
<p>you know but now he hates his parents okay</p>
<p>and he just</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t see the</p>
<p>point in participating</p>
<p>or giving us all in this new city</p>
<p>because what was the freaking</p>
<p>point they were probably gonna move</p>
<p>again once he</p>
<p>started to like it there you know now</p>
<p>shawn&rsquo;s mom</p>
<p>vonda she had a temper of her own</p>
<p>she just seemed to take her frustrations out on</p>
<p>shawn he was often</p>
<p>for different reasons she</p>
<p>would slap him across the face</p>
<p>hit him with the belt or just</p>
<p>punch him in the face</p>
<p>and all of this and the move just really</p>
<p>broke him and his anger was</p>
<p>building up inside</p>
<p>while in school sean</p>
<p>said that he received an</p>
<p>underground</p>
<p>magazine from some guy who was</p>
<p>promoting the occult</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like ooh what&rsquo;s this and like it was a handmade</p>
<p>magazine it was just filled with satanic</p>
<p>metal bands there was an</p>
<p>interview and artwork</p>
<p>from richard ramirez the night</p>
<p>stalker remember</p>
<p>there were cartoons of different serial killers in the</p>
<p>magazine it was just</p>
<p>focused mainly on satanic killers</p>
<p>sean said when he got this he was interested</p>
<p>okay he was like what is this i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never seen something like this before</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t quite</p>
<p>understand this next part but sean said that he met</p>
<p>someone who considered themselves a</p>
<p>witch no idea</p>
<p>where they met this person</p>
<p>but it was said that he met a witch</p>
<p>okay and that this witch</p>
<p>taught him the ins and out of</p>
<p>black magic</p>
<p>and that he was just really infatuated with it</p>
<p>all it was all new it was different it was intriguing</p>
<p>he liked it you know</p>
<p>so now that he was</p>
<p>introduced to it</p>
<p>shawn was trying to do all of his own research on</p>
<p>witchcraft and he</p>
<p>would go to his</p>
<p>local library</p>
<p>and find books on the</p>
<p>topic now this</p>
<p>would lead him to find books</p>
<p>about satanism and know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>they go hand in hand but this is how sean was</p>
<p>introduced to it like it was in the same section</p>
<p>so he finds this book that he&rsquo;s like oh what is this</p>
<p>satan oh let me read this you know and he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>obsessed it&rsquo;s a new obsession</p>
<p>it just really caught his interest and shaun</p>
<p>said that he was so interested in it</p>
<p>because he was mad at god</p>
<p>and that satanism</p>
<p>it was offering freedom</p>
<p>and a promise to control his life and control</p>
<p>others that&rsquo;s what really lured him in</p>
<p>the thing that sean</p>
<p>felt he lacked most in life</p>
<p>was control</p>
<p>over himself and his environment</p>
<p>at his age his life</p>
<p>could be and was easily uprooted and</p>
<p>at any moment</p>
<p>you know by his parents</p>
<p>and he just</p>
<p>loathed them</p>
<p>for that practicing satanism</p>
<p>would become like a normal</p>
<p>thing for sean in his day to day life</p>
<p>at this time he&rsquo;s also playing</p>
<p>dungeons and dragons</p>
<p>and some articles</p>
<p>try to say that</p>
<p>like inspired him even more to get into satanism</p>
<p>but sean said</p>
<p>in a blog post</p>
<p>that it was not the</p>
<p>dungeon and dragons that</p>
<p>got him into it it was just something that people were</p>
<p>using to like feed the narrative</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m just saying that because if you</p>
<p>heard that you&rsquo;re like when i&rsquo;m out dungeons</p>
<p>and dragons</p>
<p>he said it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>dungeons and dragons</p>
<p>so at this time</p>
<p>shawn he&rsquo;s into satan</p>
<p>cool so he&rsquo;s a sophomore in high</p>
<p>school at this time</p>
<p>and shawn said that he</p>
<p>would bring</p>
<p>small vials of blood</p>
<p>like wear it</p>
<p>around his neck</p>
<p>and then throughout the day in</p>
<p>class he would</p>
<p>drink the blood so he turned into like that kid</p>
<p>maybe he didn&rsquo;t have that kid in your</p>
<p>class but there</p>
<p>was like one of</p>
<p>those you know</p>
<p>drinking blood</p>
<p>not judging</p>
<p>but i can&rsquo;t imagine that&rsquo;s good for you</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know anyway so he&rsquo;s doing that</p>
<p>shawn said that satanism</p>
<p>taught him that he could make</p>
<p>own rules to live by in life</p>
<p>and the rituals</p>
<p>of it would</p>
<p>allow him to take his control</p>
<p>back and sean&rsquo;s knowledge on satanism grew</p>
<p>because he was just reading anything and</p>
<p>everything he possibly</p>
<p>could about the topic and</p>
<p>and he said that he</p>
<p>would participate in various satanic rituals</p>
<p>more and more</p>
<p>often what he didn&rsquo;t see coming though</p>
<p>was the side</p>
<p>effects that came</p>
<p>along with this</p>
<p>yes side effects</p>
<p>over time sean</p>
<p>started having strange problems as he called them</p>
<p>he said that he was hearing</p>
<p>voices in his head but he was hearing</p>
<p>voices in his head from a</p>
<p>young age but</p>
<p>these voices seemed to amplify</p>
<p>and would soon</p>
<p>sound very different than</p>
<p>how they once had</p>
<p>he said that</p>
<p>these voices were</p>
<p>demons and they urged him to do the</p>
<p>things that he wanted done</p>
<p>whatever that means you know i</p>
<p>think most people</p>
<p>would be like oh there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>demon in me</p>
<p>i need to get it out but</p>
<p>not sean nene</p>
<p>he would say that</p>
<p>these voices didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>scare him at all it just</p>
<p>solidified the idea that sean was doing something</p>
<p>right he&rsquo;s communicating with</p>
<p>these demons</p>
<p>soon after sean realized that the demon</p>
<p>voices were showing up in his mind more</p>
<p>and more and he said that he</p>
<p>began having</p>
<p>blackout periods in which</p>
<p>like a light</p>
<p>switch of his</p>
<p>awareness would be</p>
<p>flicked off for a period of time and he just</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have any memory</p>
<p>of like what happened</p>
<p>after these</p>
<p>blackouts shawn</p>
<p>could not remember what he had been doing exactly</p>
<p>he said that</p>
<p>he felt like his mind was like constantly jumbled</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>calm the voices</p>
<p>down he couldn&rsquo;t calm the thoughts down he couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>focus on anything</p>
<p>and these voices</p>
<p>were actually</p>
<p>becoming more</p>
<p>of a serious problem for him</p>
<p>so at first the</p>
<p>voices aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>bothering him he&rsquo;s kind of like oh yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>proving to me that i&rsquo;m on the</p>
<p>right track</p>
<p>but i guess the</p>
<p>voices just keep</p>
<p>going on for so long and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>becoming such a problem for him that he goes to his mom</p>
<p>and he tells her like mom</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m hearing</p>
<p>these voices in my head and i</p>
<p>think that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going crazy</p>
<p>this is what he tells his mom</p>
<p>mom is a dumbass and she&rsquo;s like oh okay</p>
<p>she assumed he was just being a</p>
<p>teenage boy just</p>
<p>going through</p>
<p>those normal</p>
<p>teenager hormonal changes you know</p>
<p>the ones where you hear</p>
<p>demons and such</p>
<p>teens so she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t do anything</p>
<p>with this information she&rsquo;s like oh you&rsquo;re crazy okay</p>
<p>get in line</p>
<p>sure so sean</p>
<p>finds that to be a little bit frustrating because</p>
<p>he feels as if his mom is not taking him seriously</p>
<p>cause she&rsquo;s not so he ends up</p>
<p>going to two different teachers</p>
<p>and he tells</p>
<p>these teachers like i&rsquo;m hearing</p>
<p>things i&rsquo;m just not feeling</p>
<p>right like something&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>right but these two teachers</p>
<p>also didn&rsquo;t do anything with the information that</p>
<p>he gave them</p>
<p>he was trying to get</p>
<p>somebody to help him</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m laughing because it&rsquo;s uncomfortable</p>
<p>right like this poor guy i don&rsquo;t know what i</p>
<p>would do so at</p>
<p>school sean</p>
<p>did have a friend his name was richard howard</p>
<p>and he ends up telling his friend richard at</p>
<p>school he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m having these really just</p>
<p>dark morbid thoughts</p>
<p>about doing really</p>
<p>awful things</p>
<p>and his friend richard</p>
<p>now he was a little nervous at</p>
<p>first to tell richard because he could</p>
<p>scare him away</p>
<p>right like if your friend tells you i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking about</p>
<p>some really dark shit</p>
<p>you might be a little</p>
<p>scared i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>so richard&rsquo;s</p>
<p>listening to this and instead of like offering</p>
<p>any type of advice or anything</p>
<p>richard tells sean</p>
<p>that he needs to embrace the thoughts</p>
<p>and that these thoughts aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>bad they&rsquo;re actually cool because i have them too</p>
<p>this is what richard&rsquo;s telling sean richard tells sean</p>
<p>i too am interested in satanism</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve always had</p>
<p>these dark thoughts and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re powerful</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s keep em</p>
<p>richard he too was deep into the darkness</p>
<p>sean said that</p>
<p>richard was way more evil than he had ever been</p>
<p>and that richard was the one who</p>
<p>initiated a lot of</p>
<p>their evil discussions that</p>
<p>they had between the two of them instead of talking</p>
<p>about whatever</p>
<p>teen boys talk</p>
<p>about sports</p>
<p>love interest or what i don&rsquo;t know what boys talk</p>
<p>about but sean</p>
<p>and richard</p>
<p>would discuss</p>
<p>potential crimes that they want to commit</p>
<p>they would go into like</p>
<p>great detail</p>
<p>about different murders and robberies</p>
<p>they wanted to commit and then they</p>
<p>would talk about</p>
<p>how they wanted to rape</p>
<p>certain people before killing them</p>
<p>in a later interview sean</p>
<p>would say that like all of</p>
<p>these discussions</p>
<p>this conversation they were all hypothetical</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t like serious</p>
<p>about it it was just for fun</p>
<p>they were using</p>
<p>their imagination</p>
<p>he also said that the two of them</p>
<p>never had any real intent to commit</p>
<p>these crimes they just thought that</p>
<p>these stories</p>
<p>would be cool to do</p>
<p>over time though</p>
<p>their friendship it grew pretty damn dark and</p>
<p>their chaps just became more and more serious like they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t choking around anymore</p>
<p>according to sean richard</p>
<p>absolutely hated his girlfriend&rsquo;s father</p>
<p>whose name was al</p>
<p>hawkes now richard</p>
<p>found out that this guy al</p>
<p>had beaten his</p>
<p>daughter over an argument</p>
<p>and left her heavily bruised so richard</p>
<p>tells shawn like hey you know</p>
<p>maybe we can borrow one of my grandpa&rsquo;s guns</p>
<p>and use that to murder</p>
<p>al hawke together</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t that be fun</p>
<p>now it didn&rsquo;t take much</p>
<p>convincing for shawn to then agree</p>
<p>sean mentioned that</p>
<p>he did want to like offer some sort of sacrifice that</p>
<p>would grant him</p>
<p>power in the</p>
<p>afterlife with</p>
<p>satan you know</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s like yeah</p>
<p>we should do that in</p>
<p>order for the two of them to feel</p>
<p>equally accomplished</p>
<p>that evening</p>
<p>richard said that he</p>
<p>would only kill l</p>
<p>after sean killed someone else first</p>
<p>that way they&rsquo;re even you know</p>
<p>the two went back and forth trying to decide who</p>
<p>would be their</p>
<p>first target finally</p>
<p>richard suggested that</p>
<p>shawn killed the</p>
<p>night shift cashier at the</p>
<p>local circle k</p>
<p>now at this</p>
<p>point shawn didn&rsquo;t really care who his victim was</p>
<p>i just wanted to know what it felt like to kill</p>
<p>the circle k cashier his name was</p>
<p>robert bauer</p>
<p>he almost always worked the midnight</p>
<p>shift during the week</p>
<p>and richard he</p>
<p>would usually stop by that circle k location</p>
<p>on his way home from seeing his</p>
<p>girlfriend most nights</p>
<p>richard said that him and the circle k cashier</p>
<p>robert they were like friendly with one another</p>
<p>but there was</p>
<p>one time when richard was trying to buy a beer</p>
<p>mind you he&rsquo;s 16</p>
<p>so like he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not gonna happen</p>
<p>he thought that robert</p>
<p>and him were cool</p>
<p>and that robert</p>
<p>would allow him to get</p>
<p>beer but instead</p>
<p>robert told him</p>
<p>no and this was enough</p>
<p>for robert to move to the top of the boys kill list</p>
<p>because they couldn&rsquo;t get beer</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not funny but it&rsquo;s like oh my god really yes</p>
<p>really so on that very same</p>
<p>night richard</p>
<p>planned on killing al</p>
<p>hawk the two of them went to the circle k</p>
<p>store first</p>
<p>so when the two of them</p>
<p>arrived they went inside</p>
<p>and they talked</p>
<p>to the cashier</p>
<p>robert bauer for some time</p>
<p>they first purchased some fountain</p>
<p>drinks and some</p>
<p>snacks and they were kind of</p>
<p>stalling until the perfect moment came</p>
<p>the teenage boys</p>
<p>asked different questions</p>
<p>about the security measures inside the</p>
<p>store they&rsquo;re asking him like hey</p>
<p>where are the cameras at you</p>
<p>guys have any cameras here do you have a gun behind the</p>
<p>counter and most of the answers were like no</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have cameras no gun</p>
<p>robert told the boys that he had</p>
<p>never been robbed before</p>
<p>and that the cash register only</p>
<p>would carry 50</p>
<p>cash all day so it was like he was sure nobody</p>
<p>would ever kill him</p>
<p>for 50 cash</p>
<p>and for the most part that was true</p>
<p>but sean wasn&rsquo;t interested in the</p>
<p>money he just wanted somebody to kill</p>
<p>so sean said that he exited the store</p>
<p>and he walked out to the</p>
<p>truck where he got the revolver that they had</p>
<p>gotten from the back seat of the</p>
<p>truck sean said for a moment he like really he</p>
<p>stood outside and he was</p>
<p>thinking like i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i can actually do this like i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m actually capable of killing somebody</p>
<p>and then sean said that</p>
<p>that light switch and his head</p>
<p>flicked and these</p>
<p>voices just</p>
<p>flooded in telling</p>
<p>him that he needed to stop being a coward</p>
<p>and that he just needed to go do it so once</p>
<p>sean got back into the</p>
<p>store robert</p>
<p>was up in his spot behind the</p>
<p>counter and then richard was walking up and down the</p>
<p>aisles pretending to</p>
<p>look for snacks</p>
<p>and richard held up a product a</p>
<p>random product from the</p>
<p>shelf and was like</p>
<p>hey how much is this</p>
<p>and robert&rsquo;s back was towards him</p>
<p>so he turns around and when he turns around standing</p>
<p>right there was sean holding a gun</p>
<p>to robert&rsquo;s face</p>
<p>like nothing was really sad</p>
<p>it was just sean</p>
<p>shoots the gun</p>
<p>luckily he misses</p>
<p>and robert is trying to get away</p>
<p>but sean keeps</p>
<p>shooting and keeps missing</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a struggle really goes on for a little bit of time it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sad and then shawn</p>
<p>shoots again</p>
<p>which at that last shot</p>
<p>is when it hits</p>
<p>and kills robert</p>
<p>for no damn reason to like</p>
<p>according to</p>
<p>sean the two boys they run out they hop into richard&rsquo;s</p>
<p>truck and they</p>
<p>sped off laughing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what he said</p>
<p>they were laughing at what they had just done</p>
<p>their adrenaline was just</p>
<p>pumping and</p>
<p>sean couldn&rsquo;t believe that like he actually did it</p>
<p>and for some reason</p>
<p>they decided not to go to al hox</p>
<p>and commit the</p>
<p>second murder</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know why sean</p>
<p>also in interviews</p>
<p>could not remember exactly why they decided to abandon</p>
<p>their original plan</p>
<p>yeah they just</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t go they didn&rsquo;t really mind it too much i</p>
<p>think they were just so high on</p>
<p>their adrenaline</p>
<p>they were i don&rsquo;t know sean was</p>
<p>excited because he had just committed his first</p>
<p>first murder</p>
<p>his first real satanic sacrifice ooh</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t long</p>
<p>after that they had</p>
<p>found robert bauer</p>
<p>the circle k cashier</p>
<p>there were no leads</p>
<p>to the murder of</p>
<p>robert bauer</p>
<p>there were no suspects in mind no evidence no cameras</p>
<p>it was just one big mystery</p>
<p>who would want this innocent</p>
<p>hard working man dead now when sean read the paper</p>
<p>with the news in it saying that they had no leads and</p>
<p>stuff he said that he was feeling</p>
<p>relieved but most of all he was feeling invincible</p>
<p>like he could get away</p>
<p>with anything</p>
<p>well not long</p>
<p>after this first murder sean got himself a girlfriend</p>
<p>oh it was more than just a</p>
<p>girlfriend it was love he was in love love</p>
<p>shawn was dating a 15 year old girl</p>
<p>named angel</p>
<p>who went to the same</p>
<p>school as shawn and that&rsquo;s how they met</p>
<p>she would go on to drop out of school</p>
<p>she was considered a difficult teen</p>
<p>she just seemed like she was up to no good</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>all that&rsquo;s how they described her i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>but sean&rsquo;s parents they did not like this relationship</p>
<p>and sean really just didn&rsquo;t seem to care</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in love mom sean&rsquo;s mom vonda</p>
<p>she did not like</p>
<p>angel okay and she</p>
<p>would often</p>
<p>bad mouth her in</p>
<p>front of sean</p>
<p>she would call her a slut or a whore</p>
<p>reminding her of what a</p>
<p>loser she was his</p>
<p>mother was doing</p>
<p>everything she possibly</p>
<p>could to try and convince</p>
<p>sean that they needed to</p>
<p>break up and that it was for his</p>
<p>own good but sean was not willing to give up the one</p>
<p>thing that was making him</p>
<p>happy in oklahoma</p>
<p>this girl angel</p>
<p>eventually shawn</p>
<p>could no longer handle</p>
<p>wei&rsquo;s mom was</p>
<p>verbally abusing both him</p>
<p>and his girlfriend she&rsquo;s only 15 years old lady</p>
<p>like back the fuck up you know that&rsquo;s not your just</p>
<p>no she had no like</p>
<p>motherly instinct towards</p>
<p>shawn in all of this</p>
<p>just building up inside of him</p>
<p>and sean said that the</p>
<p>voices inside of his head were giving him a nudge</p>
<p>telling him that sean</p>
<p>knew what he needed to do oh and he did it</p>
<p>in the evening of</p>
<p>march 5th 1986</p>
<p>well sean&rsquo;s parents were in the</p>
<p>other room sean crept into</p>
<p>their bedroom</p>
<p>opened up his stepfather&rsquo;s nightstand</p>
<p>and inside that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where he kept his 44</p>
<p>revolver so sean</p>
<p>gets the gun puts it into his</p>
<p>waistband the</p>
<p>jeans that he&rsquo;s wearing</p>
<p>and he slowly like walks back to the bedroom</p>
<p>hoping not to make a peep</p>
<p>and let his parents know that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stealing their gun</p>
<p>so he makes it back to his bedroom and he</p>
<p>closes the door</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s just waiting there he&rsquo;s waiting in his room</p>
<p>until he knows how his parents are</p>
<p>going to sleep</p>
<p>sean said that</p>
<p>while he&rsquo;s waiting</p>
<p>for his parents to like go to the room</p>
<p>he stripped down all like into his</p>
<p>black underwear</p>
<p>and performed one of his</p>
<p>rituals out of my own curiosity i was</p>
<p>trying to figure out what was this ritual he was doing</p>
<p>cause i was like what</p>
<p>are you doing but i couldn&rsquo;t figure it out he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and before stepping out of his room</p>
<p>sean convinced himself that he wasn&rsquo;t committing murder</p>
<p>he was just</p>
<p>removing an obstacle</p>
<p>from his way</p>
<p>he hears his parents go to bed</p>
<p>and he waits a little bit he does this little ritual</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s in his</p>
<p>underwear still</p>
<p>he creeps back</p>
<p>into his parents room with the gun in his hand and</p>
<p>he said that he made the last</p>
<p>minute decision</p>
<p>to kill his stepfather</p>
<p>first so he gets</p>
<p>right next to his stepfather lee and he</p>
<p>points the gun at his head and he</p>
<p>shoots yeah</p>
<p>and then of course the gunshot</p>
<p>woke wanda right up</p>
<p>right so she</p>
<p>shoots up and then shawn</p>
<p>shoots a couple of times</p>
<p>and then kills his mom</p>
<p>shawn said that he</p>
<p>fired a couple of shots</p>
<p>afterwards just to make sure you know can&rsquo;t have him be</p>
<p>alive and he killed them</p>
<p>shaun said that</p>
<p>after killing them the</p>
<p>voices left and he then had no memory</p>
<p>or no idea of what he had just done</p>
<p>which even though like</p>
<p>later on he goes into</p>
<p>great detail</p>
<p>about the murders but also he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>blackout like sure</p>
<p>afterwards sean went around the</p>
<p>house and he&rsquo;s trying to just like mess</p>
<p>everything up destroying just</p>
<p>everything he</p>
<p>could to make it look like</p>
<p>an intruder</p>
<p>came into the family home and killed his parents</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s his goal he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>knocking stuff over</p>
<p>eh you know</p>
<p>and afterwards</p>
<p>sean calls up his friend he tells them like what a</p>
<p>great job he did he went on to say that he</p>
<p>stood there in his</p>
<p>under shorts</p>
<p>while firing the shots</p>
<p>so no blood</p>
<p>would spatter</p>
<p>and be discovered on his</p>
<p>clothing and he thought like he was a</p>
<p>genius because of this</p>
<p>telling his friend he&rsquo;s like yeah</p>
<p>look what i did</p>
<p>smart the friends probably like oh my god wow genius</p>
<p>so police were called out to the family home and it was</p>
<p>clear to police that</p>
<p>night that this was all a setup</p>
<p>sean had killed his parents the way that he was out</p>
<p>acting the way that the</p>
<p>house was perfectly messed up</p>
<p>there was no</p>
<p>actual signs of there being an intruder nothing was</p>
<p>taken all their jewelry</p>
<p>their money</p>
<p>their tvs and</p>
<p>stuff like nothing was</p>
<p>taken the police knew like nene</p>
<p>this is real</p>
<p>suspicious sean said that he left the gun on the</p>
<p>floor to make it look like the intruder like</p>
<p>dropped his weapon</p>
<p>but like the gun had his fingerprints on it</p>
<p>so sean just really</p>
<p>was an idiot here</p>
<p>i was trying to figure out what exactly it was that the</p>
<p>police knew it was sean</p>
<p>like was it the way he was acting or something</p>
<p>but i really couldn&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>the information as to</p>
<p>but sealed it at the family home</p>
<p>i just was reading different articles that said</p>
<p>he was acting</p>
<p>funny the house looked</p>
<p>not like an intruder came in and</p>
<p>stuff and then he was arrested or whatever</p>
<p>and like that&rsquo;s really all i</p>
<p>could find so sean was arrested like</p>
<p>right after the discovery</p>
<p>of his parents murder when news</p>
<p>broke of the case</p>
<p>his entire community was dumbfounded this</p>
<p>young 16 year old kid had murdered his parents in cold</p>
<p>blood and more than that</p>
<p>now here was the really</p>
<p>shocking part because he</p>
<p>claimed to have done it because the</p>
<p>demon said that he should</p>
<p>now this was a christian</p>
<p>community okay this is a christian community the</p>
<p>devil is in our town</p>
<p>they are losing it</p>
<p>they are losing it</p>
<p>the christian community</p>
<p>especially was</p>
<p>using this to show</p>
<p>like he became the poster boy</p>
<p>look what can happen if your</p>
<p>child goes to the dark side</p>
<p>look what can happen</p>
<p>when your kids play</p>
<p>dungeon and dragons</p>
<p>they were running with the</p>
<p>dungeon and dragons</p>
<p>thing even though sean said that it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>dungeon and dragons they were</p>
<p>using this to try and get</p>
<p>dungeon and dragons shut down</p>
<p>they called it the</p>
<p>devil&rsquo;s board game</p>
<p>so the narrative was kind of it was getting</p>
<p>changed it became like let&rsquo;s ban</p>
<p>dungeon and dragons for a</p>
<p>while whatever it became a mess</p>
<p>so remember</p>
<p>shawn&rsquo;s friend richard</p>
<p>well richard</p>
<p>who was with</p>
<p>shawn at the time of the murder of</p>
<p>robert powers</p>
<p>he too was initially</p>
<p>charged with</p>
<p>first degree murder but the</p>
<p>state would end up dismissing the charge and</p>
<p>recommended that he give a five year suspended sentence</p>
<p>in exchange for testimony</p>
<p>against sean so richard</p>
<p>being he&rsquo;s like okay</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll testify</p>
<p>during shawn&rsquo;s</p>
<p>trial a psychiatrist testified saying that</p>
<p>shawn was incapable</p>
<p>of forming the intent</p>
<p>necessary to commit</p>
<p>first degree murder</p>
<p>because he was</p>
<p>either insane or legally</p>
<p>unconscious</p>
<p>at the time of all</p>
<p>three killings</p>
<p>the jury was not told</p>
<p>that sean was only 16 at the time of the</p>
<p>crime but instead</p>
<p>jurors were</p>
<p>asked to decide whether his</p>
<p>age was a mitigating factor</p>
<p>so the judge did not</p>
<p>allow the defense to introduce</p>
<p>expert testimony</p>
<p>that juveniles are developmentally different to adults</p>
<p>because the</p>
<p>judge said that all jurors</p>
<p>they would know that anyway</p>
<p>so shaun is only 16</p>
<p>and nobody was allowed to tell the jurors</p>
<p>that a 16 year old</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t the same as a</p>
<p>grown adult</p>
<p>because according to the</p>
<p>judge the jurors</p>
<p>already knew this</p>
<p>but the prosecution was</p>
<p>focusing on sean</p>
<p>being an adult</p>
<p>when he picked up that gun</p>
<p>that he acted like a man</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s going to have to</p>
<p>stand up there like a man</p>
<p>because he made this</p>
<p>adult man decision</p>
<p>to murder because he picked up this gun</p>
<p>he should be</p>
<p>charged as a man because he was acting like one</p>
<p>and a lot of people agreed</p>
<p>with that and i was like i don&rsquo;t know you guys but</p>
<p>well eventually sean was convicted of</p>
<p>first degree murder</p>
<p>and it was concluded that he was a continuing</p>
<p>threat to society</p>
<p>now because he was considered</p>
<p>a continuing threat</p>
<p>on october 1986</p>
<p>sean sellers was sentenced</p>
<p>to death now here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where the hot debate</p>
<p>comes in because</p>
<p>shawn at the age of 17</p>
<p>was sent to</p>
<p>death row in prison</p>
<p>as he waited for his execution</p>
<p>shawn had a</p>
<p>spiritual awakening</p>
<p>and he would end up converting to christianity</p>
<p>so shaun&rsquo;s friends</p>
<p>started a website on his behalf</p>
<p>and they were campaigning for a clemency</p>
<p>based on his religious conversion his age</p>
<p>and involvement in satanism</p>
<p>while on death row</p>
<p>sean made numerous appearances</p>
<p>in the media</p>
<p>he was on the oprah winfrey show</p>
<p>he was on a pretty notorious segment on geraldo</p>
<p>which was about</p>
<p>satanism and it was just like controversial</p>
<p>for this time</p>
<p>and he also appeared</p>
<p>shawn in many documentaries</p>
<p>about satanism</p>
<p>and serial killers for 48</p>
<p>hours msnbc</p>
<p>and the a and e network</p>
<p>so he was making his rounds</p>
<p>sean but he was</p>
<p>going around telling everybody that satanism</p>
<p>made him commit</p>
<p>these crimes</p>
<p>but now that he was a christian</p>
<p>he knew what he did was</p>
<p>wrong and christianity</p>
<p>saved his life</p>
<p>which is fine</p>
<p>right you&rsquo;re allowed to say that but</p>
<p>it had people kind of feeling a certain way</p>
<p>like was he being sincere</p>
<p>or was he talking</p>
<p>about this because like</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t wanna die he wanted to get off of death row</p>
<p>sean&rsquo;s step siblings</p>
<p>they refused to believe that his conversion</p>
<p>was sincere</p>
<p>they thought he was doing it so he</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t get put down</p>
<p>prison officials</p>
<p>they did not believe that he had converted</p>
<p>except for one guy</p>
<p>it was the prison chaplain</p>
<p>he believed that shaun was telling the</p>
<p>truth that he</p>
<p>found god and was a</p>
<p>changed man</p>
<p>so this kind of had people feeling</p>
<p>confused because</p>
<p>sean was making his way</p>
<p>around talking</p>
<p>about how god</p>
<p>saved his life how he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>changed man he&rsquo;s a christian now and</p>
<p>he loves the</p>
<p>bible in summary and</p>
<p>the christian community some were</p>
<p>standing behind him</p>
<p>pastors and</p>
<p>stuff they believed</p>
<p>him and they were like you know we have to stand by</p>
<p>our christian brother</p>
<p>but there were</p>
<p>other christians who were like but he murdered</p>
<p>three people so</p>
<p>it was like</p>
<p>creating some kind of</p>
<p>wedge in the christian community too</p>
<p>so the days are going by</p>
<p>and shawn&rsquo;s</p>
<p>execution date is</p>
<p>creeping up closer</p>
<p>and closer and</p>
<p>shawn is trying</p>
<p>senselessly</p>
<p>to get his case appealed</p>
<p>even a couple of days before his</p>
<p>execution he was</p>
<p>begging for his case to be overturned stopped</p>
<p>something but all of</p>
<p>shawn&rsquo;s appeals were denied</p>
<p>it was creating</p>
<p>like a hot debate because a lot of people</p>
<p>were like okay he was only sixteen when he committed</p>
<p>these murders like he shouldn&rsquo;t be on</p>
<p>death row we shouldn&rsquo;t be killing kids</p>
<p>but then the</p>
<p>other side of people are like</p>
<p>he killed three people</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>once a killer always a killer</p>
<p>put him down</p>
<p>people didn&rsquo;t know how to feel</p>
<p>about this one</p>
<p>and death row</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very slow process you sit there forever</p>
<p>so sean sat on death row</p>
<p>until february 4th 1999 and he was now</p>
<p>29 years old</p>
<p>so now he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>29 years old and a lot of people are like well</p>
<p>should he be</p>
<p>put down for the</p>
<p>crime that he committed</p>
<p>when he was only 16 years old you know like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>grown he&rsquo;s changed</p>
<p>he says he&rsquo;s changed</p>
<p>the christian community</p>
<p>heard sean&rsquo;s cries</p>
<p>and believed that he had</p>
<p>changed and some were</p>
<p>fighting for his freedom</p>
<p>others really didn&rsquo;t know what to</p>
<p>think because he was a murderer and this is america</p>
<p>and you know how america feels</p>
<p>about murderers</p>
<p>so the crimes that sean had committed everyone could</p>
<p>agree they were</p>
<p>absolutely horrible tragic</p>
<p>awful but his punishment</p>
<p>was a bit much</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what the</p>
<p>people are saying</p>
<p>at this time oklahoma had</p>
<p>never executed a prisoner for a</p>
<p>crime committed</p>
<p>when they were</p>
<p>under 18 years old</p>
<p>but the show must go on</p>
<p>so sean got to pick his last meal</p>
<p>as all prisoners usually do</p>
<p>right but his last meal if</p>
<p>you are curious like myself he had chinese food he got</p>
<p>sweet and sour</p>
<p>shrimp he got</p>
<p>fried shrimp and</p>
<p>and he was on his way to be executed</p>
<p>which he was on february 4 1999</p>
<p>at 12 17 am</p>
<p>shawn died by lethal injection</p>
<p>into his arms</p>
<p>five minutes beforehand</p>
<p>during the last</p>
<p>five minutes of his life it was said that</p>
<p>shawn sang christian songs before saying</p>
<p>here i come father</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m coming home</p>
<p>and then shawn</p>
<p>turned to the</p>
<p>warden looked him in the eyes and said let&rsquo;s do it gary</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get it on</p>
<p>shawn&rsquo;s last words were a prayer he made</p>
<p>quite the exit</p>
<p>and then the switch in</p>
<p>shawn seller&rsquo;s mind was officially</p>
<p>flicked off for the last</p>
<p>time sean was the first and</p>
<p>still remains the only person</p>
<p>executed in the united</p>
<p>states for a</p>
<p>crime committed</p>
<p>under the age of 17</p>
<p>since the reinstatement of the death</p>
<p>penalty in 1976</p>
<p>now in 2005</p>
<p>the us supreme</p>
<p>court decided that it was</p>
<p>unconstitutional</p>
<p>to execute an</p>
<p>individual for a</p>
<p>crime committed</p>
<p>under the age of</p>
<p>18 therefore</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t execute someone who commits an</p>
<p>awful crime</p>
<p>under the age of 18</p>
<p>and that my friends is a very sad</p>
<p>story about sean sellers</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get me</p>
<p>wrong what he did was</p>
<p>awful absolutely</p>
<p>awful he killed</p>
<p>three people he took</p>
<p>three people</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about his parents</p>
<p>because his mom</p>
<p>sounded like the absolute devil</p>
<p>and to be fair like i&rsquo;m not here trying</p>
<p>to justify murder at all but okay that one makes sense</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m saying like the gas station</p>
<p>robert bauer</p>
<p>like innocent man he died and he did not deserve that</p>
<p>right what shaun</p>
<p>did was awful</p>
<p>i just don&rsquo;t know how i feel</p>
<p>about executing someone under the</p>
<p>age of 18 like that is really sad</p>
<p>but he murdered</p>
<p>three people</p>
<p>so it is a really i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>just a wasted life honestly</p>
<p>because of sean&rsquo;s case though</p>
<p>the us supreme</p>
<p>court stepped in</p>
<p>and passed a law saying that you can&rsquo;t execute anyone</p>
<p>under the age of eighteen</p>
<p>which i think is good</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t freaking know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t like to play god i don&rsquo;t like to</p>
<p>say when someone</p>
<p>should die with someone</p>
<p>should not i just</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know some people deserve the</p>
<p>death penalty</p>
<p>truly and then sometimes i&rsquo;m like man</p>
<p>just let them rot in prison that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worse than the</p>
<p>death penalty</p>
<p>in my eyes you know</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>freaking know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m so torn on the</p>
<p>death penalty it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird one the</p>
<p>death penalty is so strange</p>
<p>oh my god i just thought of something do they have the</p>
<p>death penalty in other</p>
<p>countries i didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think about that i know some</p>
<p>countries do for sure but it&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>thing everywhere huh or is it</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know but i have to google that one anyways</p>
<p>thank you guys so much for hanging out with me</p>
<p>today i hope you</p>
<p>have a wonderful rest of your day you make good choices</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll be seeing you guys later</p>
