    <p>Look at this red on my stock screen, I can&rsquo;t believe what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Stocks are down, doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m a loser, I don&rsquo;t know, I need some self-worth now.</p>
<p>Oh God.</p>
<p>In 3, 2, 1.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rainman David Sachs.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s said we open-sourced it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>Queen of Kinwan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Hey everybody, hey everybody, welcome back.</p>
<p>The All In podcast is back.</p>
<p>Apologies about last week, I had a personal emergency.</p>
<p>Are we allowed to say why?</p>
<p>Of course, I mean.</p>
<p>You can say it, go say it, say it.</p>
<p>Say it, it&rsquo;s a humble brag.</p>
<p>With us today on the program.</p>
<p>Explain it, explain it.</p>
<p>Queen of Kinwan, David Freeburg, Tremont Folly, Hoppity and the Dictator.</p>
<p>And the Rainman himself, David Sachs.</p>
<p>I was on a world tour.</p>
<p>I was on a world tour.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell the story.</p>
<p>Obviously I don&rsquo;t like to talk about a certain friend of mine because he&rsquo;s very high profile.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t talk about it in public.</p>
<p>Just flex.</p>
<p>Just flex.</p>
<p>Just do it and move on.</p>
<p>I have been lifting, I just want to let people know the good shows back.</p>
<p>No, you were backstage at SNL helping Elon with the SNL appearance.</p>
<p>This is true.</p>
<p>Tell us what that was like.</p>
<p>Tell us about the backstage experience at SNL.</p>
<p>Tell us about the backstage experience.</p>
<p>I mean, we were living it out in real time with you guys.</p>
<p>But tell us what it was really like.</p>
<p>First tell us why Elon recruited you to do it.</p>
<p>Are you Elon&rsquo;s funniest friend?</p>
<p>Arguably.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, he&rsquo;s got a lot of friends.</p>
<p>Guys, hold on.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you remember the joke at Sachs&rsquo; roast five years ago?</p>
<p>Remember when Elon was late and I had that ad-lib joke?</p>
<p>No, Jason, my thing.</p>
<p>When I was being roasted?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Wait, was it Jason&rsquo;s party?</p>
<p>Sachs.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I hosted Jason&rsquo;s roast.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It was your roast.</p>
<p>It was your roast.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Anyways.</p>
<p>Okay, go ahead.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the funniest.</p>
<p>Otherwise known as the funniest night of all of our collective lives.</p>
<p>It was really funny.</p>
<p>That was really funny.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have to tell stories from that sometime.</p>
<p>Sometime we&rsquo;ll tell the J-Cow roast.</p>
<p>You probably are Elon&rsquo;s funniest friend and have a talent for writing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not beat around the bush.</p>
<p>You do.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not beat around the bush.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take the compliment.</p>
<p>So I left to go on a little trip to go to Austin to see some friends and then Miami to</p>
<p>see some friends.</p>
<p>One of those friends who I hooked up with and was hanging out with in Miami was obviously</p>
<p>Elon.</p>
<p>And he was doing Saturday Night Live and we were just coming up with ideas around the</p>
<p>dinner table and we were just laughing our asses off, just brainstorming ideas that wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>never be allowed on television, you know, and he said, hey, would you come with me</p>
<p>to Saturday Night Live?</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Do you have enough tickets?</p>
<p>I assumed he meant Saturday night, you know, and he said, no, I don&rsquo;t have a lot of tickets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s COVID.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like half his money.</p>
<p>Would you come with me to the writer&rsquo;s room and just, you know, be my wingman, basically.</p>
<p>So I had like three or four board meetings and five podcasts.</p>
<p>So I just, you know, I talked.</p>
<p>So it was like an instant yes?</p>
<p>You checked your schedule?</p>
<p>I was like.</p>
<p>You had to check your schedule?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have to check my schedule.</p>
<p>No, I mean, I take my work seriously.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, Elon, Elon, can you give me about half a second to decide?</p>
<p>I had already made the decision in my mind that if my friend needs help, you guys have</p>
<p>been in similar situations where you&rsquo;ve asked me for help.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve rolled with Chamath on speaking gigs or going down to try to, you know, save Saks</p>
<p>from going into complete, utter madness.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>This is not crisis management.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>So you said yes, you went.</p>
<p>So I said yes.</p>
<p>And, you know, without giving, well, without giving away anything that was private or confidential,</p>
<p>they have a process that they&rsquo;ve been doing for 46 years.</p>
<p>And we came in, you know, with our own process of what we wanted to do.</p>
<p>And it kind of was, you know, kind of an interesting thing, because a lot of the ideas I had were,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say a little too far out for the cast or for the writers, but some of them</p>
<p>landed.</p>
<p>And I got to spend a lot of time with Lauren Michaels, and I really worked on my impersonation</p>
<p>of him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s Canadian.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s Canadian.</p>
<p>And I was like, so Lauren, tell us, who were the worst hosts ever?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, um, it&rsquo;s an interesting question, Jason, you know, we don&rsquo;t like to think of</p>
<p>it that way, but with, um, in terms of people who thought they were smart and maybe were</p>
<p>not as smart as they thought they were, Steven Seagal was a little bit difficult.</p>
<p>And there was Chris Christopherson, you know, back in 78, he wasn&rsquo;t a musical guest.</p>
<p>That was Carly Simon.</p>
<p>And he liked to drink.</p>
<p>And in this very green room in 78, he had a couple of drinks during the rehearsal, the</p>
<p>dress rehearsal.</p>
<p>We all did some coffee.</p>
<p>And like any sports team, when the game starts, we play the game.</p>
<p>Okay, so who was responsible for the Chad skit?</p>
<p>Okay, so Chad&rsquo;s an existing character.</p>
<p>And that was a really amazing one to watch, because we went to Brooklyn to a warehouse</p>
<p>and the production was incredible.</p>
<p>And the role I played, if I&rsquo;m being totally honest, is to just, you know, be Elon&rsquo;s friend</p>
<p>and be there with him.</p>
<p>But also, you know, was that funny for you?</p>
<p>Should I do that?</p>
<p>Punch up.</p>
<p>You were a punch up man.</p>
<p>I was a punch up guy.</p>
<p>I wrote some lines without, you know, taking anything away from the writers there who do</p>
<p>the bulk of the work and the actors and the set designers.</p>
<p>It is amazing to see what they do.</p>
<p>Like we had to go through 40 scripts and you know, when you read something in a script,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of hard to know if it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>But then when you put Chloe or you know, Kate McKinnon or Colin Jost or Che or Mikey Day,</p>
<p>like these people are phenomenally talented.</p>
<p>So all of a sudden the script comes alive.</p>
<p>So for the two punch ups, I got really good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just give you one anecdote because I don&rsquo;t want to get myself in too much trouble.</p>
<p>Were you responsible for besties in the Gen Z hospital?</p>
<p>No comment on that one.</p>
<p>I thought that as soon as I saw it, I thought of you.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>The other one that I thought was incredibly well done was murder dirter.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I had nothing to do with that one.</p>
<p>And I thought we thought that was like, we thought that one was incredibly dumb.</p>
<p>Like when you read it on the script, it was like, is this funny or not?</p>
<p>But they, you know, this is the thing, you add tremendous performance, and you add incredible</p>
<p>set design.</p>
<p>And we were we were in Brooklyn at three in the morning, and Ilan comes out with that</p>
<p>wig on in a suit.</p>
<p>We just started laughing hysterical.</p>
<p>And he just goes right into creepy priest.</p>
<p>It was hilarious.</p>
<p>That was great.</p>
<p>What about the Asperger&rsquo;s joke?</p>
<p>Because yeah, that was me.</p>
<p>Yeah, because you use that as a tease amongst people we may mutually know a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was like, Oh, that&rsquo;s a Jason show.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually what I&rsquo;m proud of.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s so ironic, no, but what&rsquo;s so ironic is the Asperger&rsquo;s joke came out.</p>
<p>And then everyone, all these press articles got written saying, Ilan has admitted publicly</p>
<p>to having Asperger&rsquo;s and he is we are so proud of him.</p>
<p>And it is such a moment to come clean about having this this thing.</p>
<p>And it was like a Jason joke.</p>
<p>Yeah, this Jason joke that became a Oh my gosh, you know, what are the I&rsquo;ll tell you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m particularly proud of that one.</p>
<p>Because here&rsquo;s how that one went down.</p>
<p>They had an idea to do Jeopardy.</p>
<p>And it was probably the flattest pitch.</p>
<p>Because you know, it&rsquo;s like 11 o&rsquo;clock at night, a writer comes in and says, we want</p>
<p>to do Jeopardy auditions.</p>
<p>And we want it&rsquo;s a kind of a feature for the cast to do auditions.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you ever saw the Star Wars auditions, Jurassic Park auditions kind of</p>
<p>in that vein.</p>
<p>So I was like, for me, I was like, Oh, that sounds like it&rsquo;s got potential.</p>
<p>But it was a very dry pitch.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have any examples.</p>
<p>And when they actually did it, it was like really weird characters that were obscure.</p>
<p>So I had pitched my own version of Jeopardy and Elon had his version of Jeopardy.</p>
<p>Elon&rsquo;s version of Jeopardy was Dictator Jeopardy, which was Kim Jong Un, you know, MBS, Putin,</p>
<p>you know, etc.</p>
<p>And then I was like, how to deal with your adversaries.</p>
<p>And he was like, for 800 and he&rsquo;s like, Plutonium and I was like, Genocide, it got really dark.</p>
<p>So we are laughing our asses about that.</p>
<p>You know, but then like, there were security concerns, basically, we&rsquo;re kind of dialing</p>
<p>this around.</p>
<p>It would be as funny as the, it would be a direct correlation of funny to the chances</p>
<p>of Elon being assassinated by one of those people.</p>
<p>So then we decided maybe we don&rsquo;t do that one.</p>
<p>And I said, I&rsquo;ve got a great idea, Asperger&rsquo;s Jeopardy.</p>
<p>And it would be Zuck, Elizabeth Holmes, which Chloe from the show, who&rsquo;s an absolute genius,</p>
<p>incredibly sweet.</p>
<p>And she really engaged deeply with Elon and connected with our team.</p>
<p>And then obviously, Elon.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;d have Elon playing Zuck, somebody playing Elon, and then Chloe playing Elizabeth</p>
<p>Holmes, and they would be like, you know, how to deal with an intense situation with</p>
<p>an employee and then press it, don&rsquo;t make eye contact, you know, like, so one of the</p>
<p>writers, I could tell she was not happy about this.</p>
<p>And she says, listen, my husband has Asperger&rsquo;s, my two brothers have Asperger&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, we&rsquo;re in like, okay, you know.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t offend anyone, Landon.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t offend anybody, Landon.</p>
<p>I would say, you know, 80, 90% of the staff is very, you know, like, let&rsquo;s go for it.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s probably 10 or 20 who are very sensitive to different topics.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a little navigation you have to do there.</p>
<p>But we really want, and then so Elon goes, I have Asperger&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And you know, like the whole room is like, wow.</p>
<p>So then I was workshopping with somebody and I wasn&rsquo;t in the writer&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>I contributed 2% that max.</p>
<p>Other than, you know, being Elon&rsquo;s friend and supporting him.</p>
<p>But, you know, they came in and said, hey, when they didn&rsquo;t want to ask Elon something,</p>
<p>they came to me.</p>
<p>And I negotiated some situations like they didn&rsquo;t originally want to have any Dogefather</p>
<p>or any cryptocurrencies on the show.</p>
<p>We had to negotiate that.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, no, they have they have they have general counsel there.</p>
<p>They have standards.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re now on it.</p>
<p>Now we know why the show is not funny anymore.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s too many people with the veto.</p>
<p>I love the show.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very funny.</p>
<p>I just think Elon made it culturally relevant for the first time in like a decade.</p>
<p>But what you&rsquo;re describing is too many people with a veto right over the content of the</p>
<p>show.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes it not funny.</p>
<p>You got to be willing.</p>
<p>No, no, I think the show is very funny.</p>
<p>I think they take some artistic risk.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s not funny to us might be like funny to some other folks.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s hit or miss.</p>
<p>But certainly moving the show from 1130 on the West Coast definitely has an impact.</p>
<p>So what they could have done 10 years ago, before the timing was synced between the West</p>
<p>and East Coast is different.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re now on time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a big cultural shift that&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, I&rsquo;ll give you the two.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not John Belushi anymore.</p>
<p>When the like the corporate CEO comes on the show and wants to do crazier, wilder stuff</p>
<p>than the people, you know, the regulars.</p>
<p>But anyway, keep going.</p>
<p>So anyway, you know, one of the folks who&rsquo;s working on the monologue, you know, comes</p>
<p>in and the original monologue, you know, all these things go from rough to potential, to</p>
<p>good, to great, to amazing.</p>
<p>And so for me, it was, you know, just you guys know my career choice.</p>
<p>That just really made me think like, maybe I picked the wrong career choice because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>pretty fucking good at this.</p>
<p>I should do this.</p>
<p>So I started to call it at the after party.</p>
<p>I was like, you know, I&rsquo;ve kind of made my money already.</p>
<p>Is there any chance I can get an internship?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, no.</p>
<p>But I think Jason, you can, you can always take credit for being the third or fourth</p>
<p>writer on Elon&rsquo;s monologue.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>So anyway, they&rsquo;re doing the, they said they wanted to do an Asperger&rsquo;s joke.</p>
<p>I said, so I wrote the Asperger joke of, you know, Hey, I just want to let people know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got Asperger&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s not going to be a lot of eye contact tonight.</p>
<p>So if you see me looking off screen, it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m looking at cue cards.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that I have Asperger&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So they didn&rsquo;t keep the cue card part, but they kept the rest of it.</p>
<p>And then they did the OJ joke, which was written by Colin Jost, who is absolutely phenomenal</p>
<p>as a human, just as a writer and a collaborator.</p>
<p>And we spent a lot of time with Colin Jost.</p>
<p>He came in and they had this joke about OJ having been on in 79 and 96.</p>
<p>The 96 was a joke.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t actually on a 96.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s when he went to jail or something.</p>
<p>And I said to him, I said, I don&rsquo;t think people understand the joke.</p>
<p>They actually think he was on a 96.</p>
<p>He goes, well, let&rsquo;s just rehearse it.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re in the green room rehearsing.</p>
<p>And Elon goes, you know, so hey, and you know, like OJ, like, you know, like I&rsquo;m smoking</p>
<p>weed on every podcast.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like saying OJ, you know, you know, you murdered once and now he&rsquo;s a murderer</p>
<p>forever, you know.</p>
<p>And, you know, side note, he was on in 79 and 96.</p>
<p>And I just go like this and he killed both times.</p>
<p>And the room, there&rsquo;s like a silence and then everybody goes hysterical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like one of my, you know, poker asides.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s fabulous.</p>
<p>When I drop a joke and I take a sip of my wine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fabulous.</p>
<p>I bet there was like a split second where everyone looks left and right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, is it okay to laugh?</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s my point.</p>
<p>Like, is it okay to laugh at this?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And Colin Jost just looks at me and goes, that&rsquo;s getting in there.</p>
<p>And so I landed that one.</p>
<p>So there were, you know, some moments like that.</p>
<p>For me, I tell you, I&rsquo;ll get emotional talking about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the happiest times I&rsquo;ve ever seen in Elon&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been with him for 20 years.</p>
<p>Actually, I&rsquo;ve known him for 25, obviously.</p>
<p>In the feeling of Monday and Tuesday that, oh my God, this could be a complete, utter disaster.</p>
<p>I mean, that was our fear.</p>
<p>And that like, we were just not in sync here.</p>
<p>And these, maybe it&rsquo;s going to be unfunny.</p>
<p>And this is a huge mistake.</p>
<p>Like, that was kind of our vibe from our squad.</p>
<p>And we had three of us there, including Elon.</p>
<p>And then, you know, we, the Asperger jokes lands.</p>
<p>And I tell you, a woman from a wardrobe comes in and she&rsquo;s crying.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s crying.</p>
<p>And she says, you know, she sees me first.</p>
<p>And we, she had been there when we were doing the joke.</p>
<p>And she said, my son, you know, was beat up for having Asperger&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And, you know, this changes everything.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Just tears.</p>
<p>It became like a serious thing.</p>
<p>Three or four people came in to the room.</p>
<p>I kid you&rsquo;re not crying.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>One in 20 boys, I think now have Asperger&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Do you guys remember In Living Color?</p>
<p>Do you remember that show from the early 90s?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Can you juxtapose like comedy today and comedy from In Living Color,</p>
<p>where they had like Damon Wayans as like the homeless guy</p>
<p>and like everything that would be so like non-PC today</p>
<p>and like totally inappropriate.</p>
<p>And how much things have shifted where like,</p>
<p>even the joke becomes like, you know, a serious kind of.</p>
<p>Can I ask a question?</p>
<p>Sorry, Jason, when people were getting emotional,</p>
<p>it was because of why they were like,</p>
<p>thank you for validating and putting it out there</p>
<p>and showing a role model.</p>
<p>One of the Squawk Alley guys, you know,</p>
<p>basically got choked up twice on Monday.</p>
<p>And he said, Elon can do no wrong in my mind now</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m dealing with a son who has Asperger&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and they do something sometimes</p>
<p>that can be very challenging as a parent, right?</p>
<p>And it just explains a lot about,</p>
<p>and we all know people who have Asperger&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and we know people who have it further on the spectrum.</p>
<p>And as someone who&rsquo;s been accused of being on the spectrum,</p>
<p>can I speak to this issue?</p>
<p>I mean, like, look, if anything, Asperger&rsquo;s is correlated</p>
<p>with an extreme ability to focus and to be successful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s so many people in tech</p>
<p>who have Asperger&rsquo;s or have been accused</p>
<p>of having Asperger&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that people have to be, I guess,</p>
<p>unless you have like an extremely like extreme case,</p>
<p>like on the kind of in the autistic part of the spectrum,</p>
<p>but like mild Asperger&rsquo;s probably is correlated</p>
<p>with success because it&rsquo;s like the opposite of ADD, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the extreme ability to focus.</p>
<p>But honestly, like what you&rsquo;re describing to me</p>
<p>sounds so lame.</p>
<p>Like, this is why the show&rsquo;s not funny anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about the jokes.</p>
<p>Look, it should be about the jokes.</p>
<p>The joke landed, I disagree 100%.</p>
<p>That joke landed, it made everybody laugh.</p>
<p>It may have landed a little too close to somebody.</p>
<p>Hold on guys, guys, just to disintroduce.</p>
<p>The reason, David, you&rsquo;re saying this</p>
<p>is because we all know, at least the three of us,</p>
<p>four of us, what did not make it</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s on the cutting room.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re saying it.</p>
<p>And so I think you have to just kind of move on.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t say what didn&rsquo;t make it to the cutting room floor,</p>
<p>but I will tell you, I will reveal one skit</p>
<p>that made it to rehearsal.</p>
<p>No, you can&rsquo;t, you cannot, you cannot.</p>
<p>I can.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one.</p>
<p>I mean, there was one they recorded,</p>
<p>which I think will come out as a digital short.</p>
<p>And the premise is FOMO Capital,</p>
<p>Fear of Missing Out Capital.</p>
<p>That was good.</p>
<p>That was a good one.</p>
<p>That was your idea or Elon&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to remember where it originated.</p>
<p>We were just talking about, you know,</p>
<p>just the state of like people buying NFTs and everything.</p>
<p>And I think Elon may have said, like, they all have FOMO.</p>
<p>And then I was like, yeah,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like a venture capital firm.</p>
<p>And then he named it FOMO Capital.</p>
<p>So it was a little bit of a collaboration,</p>
<p>but I think mostly Elon in that one.</p>
<p>And this person comes in and the skit is hilarious.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re probably going to release it as a digital short,</p>
<p>like cut for time, but release it.</p>
<p>And the skit, the person comes in</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s like an associate who&rsquo;s being trained.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, welcome to FOMO Capital,</p>
<p>where we never say no to nothing.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, okay, I don&rsquo;t know if I understand that.</p>
<p>Like sit down, you&rsquo;ll get the hang of it.</p>
<p>And then people come in with increasingly ridiculous ideas.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just tell you one of them,</p>
<p>which is when it comes in, it goes,</p>
<p>so you guys know Impossible Meats?</p>
<p>This is impossible vegetables.</p>
<p>These taste just like vegetables,</p>
<p>but this broccoli is made with endangered white rhinos.</p>
<p>And she takes a bite of it, tastes just like broccoli.</p>
<p>And Elon goes, this is amazing.</p>
<p>And they hand them a Picasso.</p>
<p>And then somebody comes in and says like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just hilarious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just more and more money being poured.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t that get in the show?</p>
<p>Well, what they do is they do a two hour show</p>
<p>with a live audience and they just take out two or three skits.</p>
<p>And so there were three skits,</p>
<p>I think that were taken out for time.</p>
<p>And then those could be released digitally now.</p>
<p>So they just want to have extra.</p>
<p>They did a long opening.</p>
<p>They did like, I think it was like 10 minutes</p>
<p>on the Mother&rsquo;s Day one.</p>
<p>Can I just say Miley Cyrus has the most incredible voice.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I could listen to her sing forever.</p>
<p>Oh, she has got an incredible voice.</p>
<p>So I thought the opening was really shaky.</p>
<p>I mean, I was there.</p>
<p>This is the first time I&rsquo;ve watched live TV</p>
<p>in like 10 years, ever since Apple TV was invented.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting there waiting for Elon to come out</p>
<p>and crush the monologue.</p>
<p>And then Miley Cyrus does this long,</p>
<p>unfunny thing with all these mothers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s meant to be.</p>
<p>First of all, first of all, David, it&rsquo;s not a thing.</p>
<p>It was a song.</p>
<p>It was a song.</p>
<p>It was a tribute.</p>
<p>It was a WTF moment for me.</p>
<p>I was like, where is Elon?</p>
<p>Bring out Elon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not here to see a bunch of mothers.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s an interesting, I&rsquo;ll tell you,</p>
<p>that was an interesting moment, David.</p>
<p>Because they were like, Elon,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll put you in like four of the skits out of the seven.</p>
<p>And Elon, and we don&rsquo;t want to work, you know,</p>
<p>Elon too hard.</p>
<p>So I was doing these sort of sidebars</p>
<p>with some of the producers,</p>
<p>one in particular, who is just a phenomenon.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s, she&rsquo;s an amazing producer</p>
<p>who just gets everything done.</p>
<p>Because this all occurs from Monday to Saturday.</p>
<p>And they work 16, 18 hours a day.</p>
<p>And, you know, she said, you know,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want to take up too much of his time.</p>
<p>So we think four is the right number.</p>
<p>And I said, you know, he gave up the week.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the busiest guy in the world, arguably.</p>
<p>He wants to be in every skit.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, well, nobody really does that.</p>
<p>Maybe a comedian here or there.</p>
<p>And Elon just said, if I&rsquo;m here, use me.</p>
<p>I want to be in every skit.</p>
<p>And like, we had to like reshuffle the deck a bit.</p>
<p>And he was willing to do anything,</p>
<p>including Wario or, you know, and wear a costume</p>
<p>or be the creepy priest.</p>
<p>Elon was funny.</p>
<p>I think he surprised everyone</p>
<p>in terms of being a performer.</p>
<p>Just in terms of his performance.</p>
<p>I think it was really strong.</p>
<p>It was as good as like, you know,</p>
<p>someone who&rsquo;s in the entertainment business would be,</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a universal take.</p>
<p>Even Elon&rsquo;s sort of haters had to concede</p>
<p>that he performed well.</p>
<p>He kind of committed to all those roles,</p>
<p>even when it was like poking fun at himself.</p>
<p>Yeah, I had to dunk on Professor Dummy Galloway,</p>
<p>who was like, I&rsquo;m going to live tweet Elon.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s just like going on CNN, talking about Elon.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going on every fucking cable channel he can</p>
<p>to like ride Elon&rsquo;s coattails.</p>
<p>And he tweeted Elon would,</p>
<p>Tesla would lose 80, 90% of its value two years ago.</p>
<p>Like, just are you kidding me?</p>
<p>But I agree.</p>
<p>Like even someone like Professor Galloway,</p>
<p>who said Tesla was worthless.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s now just all over it.</p>
<p>And it humanized him, you know, which is nice.</p>
<p>I think he did a great job.</p>
<p>And it was fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super happy for him.</p>
<p>Lauren Michaels came in and said,</p>
<p>Elon, you did a great job.</p>
<p>Come back any time, sincerely.</p>
<p>And I said, how about next year?</p>
<p>Like, uh,</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re his agent.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like his agent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, basically, I&rsquo;m his agent.</p>
<p>What do we, what do we do in sequel?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a punch up guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the agent.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the hype man.</p>
<p>The negotiator.</p>
<p>I was doing mostly negotiations.</p>
<p>And, and, and Lauren Michaels said,</p>
<p>absolutely, Jason, we&rsquo;d love to have Elon back.</p>
<p>You absolutely crushed it.</p>
<p>And I, you know, Elon&rsquo;s busy in the green room.</p>
<p>By the way, do we know what the ratings were?</p>
<p>A third best show of the season so far.</p>
<p>I think not counting all the YouTube views</p>
<p>and the international views.</p>
<p>I think Chappelle&rsquo;s the only person who beat him.</p>
<p>So a couple of those, a couple of those skits</p>
<p>are going to live forever.</p>
<p>I think on YouTube.</p>
<p>I mean, the Chad skit in particular</p>
<p>was really hit it out of the park.</p>
<p>By the way, my observation on the skits were</p>
<p>the ones where Elon was kind of indispensable</p>
<p>were like the real, we&rsquo;re really great.</p>
<p>Like the Chad thing.</p>
<p>And I thought that the Western run where, well,</p>
<p>LaRon, you know, where he plays this like 18th century</p>
<p>old West version of himself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this genius in the old West.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s telling them to ride electric horses or something.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>For me, that was really funny.</p>
<p>So I thought the ones where Elon was sort of indispensable,</p>
<p>the more indispensable Elon was to the skit,</p>
<p>I thought the better it was.</p>
<p>And then some of the skits, I mean, look,</p>
<p>live sketch comedy is very hit or miss.</p>
<p>I thought the ones that were more missed</p>
<p>were the ones where they could have done them</p>
<p>without Elon.</p>
<p>It could have been a skit.</p>
<p>Any, any, you know, any SNL.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of like, yeah, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t you take advantage of having Elon there?</p>
<p>And they did, you know, and just to the staff,</p>
<p>you know, first off, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I was such a ruckus disruptor in the space.</p>
<p>But really, I mean, what a great time.</p>
<p>Elon had a great time.</p>
<p>The after party was amazing.</p>
<p>And describe the after party, were they wearing masks?</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s a good segue.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good segue.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s outside.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ll just leave it outside.</p>
<p>It was an outside party.</p>
<p>But we danced until, this is actually for real.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a good segue into</p>
<p>just what we&rsquo;re seeing out there.</p>
<p>I left San Francisco having been yelled at somebody</p>
<p>because my mask fell off.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know it.</p>
<p>And I had gone into, you know, a store</p>
<p>and they were like, your mask.</p>
<p>And they yelled it across the store, you know,</p>
<p>and I was like, oh, sorry.</p>
<p>You know, it was just kind of, you know,</p>
<p>when they fall off, you don&rsquo;t notice it.</p>
<p>Then I got to Austin.</p>
<p>And when I&rsquo;m in Austin, I&rsquo;m walking down the street.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the only person in Austin wearing a mask.</p>
<p>And somebody points at me and goes,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to wear that mask, son.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, and I look around.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nobody wearing a mask.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my first day there.</p>
<p>And he goes, you&rsquo;ve been vaccinated?</p>
<p>I said, yeah.</p>
<p>He goes, you really don&rsquo;t need to wear a mask.</p>
<p>So I take the mask off.</p>
<p>I get to Florida.</p>
<p>A friend of mine was out, you know,</p>
<p>having a cocktail at a bar.</p>
<p>Invites me to meet him for a cocktail.</p>
<p>I go to meet him for a cocktail.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a DJ and he who shall not be named.</p>
<p>Anyway, I went to have a cocktail,</p>
<p>as one does in Miami.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 100, 200 people, 200 people in the club.</p>
<p>The only people wearing masks are the staff</p>
<p>who are wearing them as chin guards.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s not the purpose of this, but OK.</p>
<p>So and then I get to New York</p>
<p>and everybody in New York is wearing one</p>
<p>or two masks on the street.</p>
<p>And I walked down an empty street.</p>
<p>OK, so we should talk.</p>
<p>We should talk about that CDC article</p>
<p>that was in The New York Times,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s an incredible summary, Jason,</p>
<p>of this whole issue in a nutshell,</p>
<p>which is it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>And then to just give Saturday Night Live a nod.</p>
<p>Every day, everybody tested.</p>
<p>You got, you know, two tests like that.</p>
<p>I forget the names of them now</p>
<p>since I stopped taking them.</p>
<p>But you did like the big one and the small one.</p>
<p>Every day you got tested.</p>
<p>Every day you got wristbands.</p>
<p>You had to wear a mask 100% of the time.</p>
<p>And then when you were in the studio,</p>
<p>you had to wear the glass shield.</p>
<p>So if you saw the picture I did of myself and Elon</p>
<p>and Blood Pop, Michael, who&rsquo;s a famous producer</p>
<p>for Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a friend of ours, Mike had to wear it, too.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re I mean, Elon had a mask on</p>
<p>because he had to take it off to do skits.</p>
<p>But all the rehearsals, everybody was masked up,</p>
<p>including the actors.</p>
<p>And everybody was vaccinated.</p>
<p>So they really are taking this seriously.</p>
<p>And I understand because they in New York,</p>
<p>they had a ton of people die.</p>
<p>And to get my understanding,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I heard secondhand,</p>
<p>was that Lauren Michaels had to get a special variance</p>
<p>to keep Saturday Night Live on the air</p>
<p>from, you know, the governor and the mayor</p>
<p>and everybody had to sign off on it.</p>
<p>But I tweeted-</p>
<p>This is not taking COVID seriously.</p>
<p>This is basically an irrational fear of COVID.</p>
<p>Well, because they got hit the hardest, David.</p>
<p>So I think that they got hit the hardest.</p>
<p>And I tweeted,</p>
<p>why is everybody wearing a mask in New York?</p>
<p>And of course, I got like 100,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a pandemic.</p>
<p>But then what the two reasons that made sense were</p>
<p>so many people died</p>
<p>and there was so much suffering in New York,</p>
<p>that people out of a sign of respect</p>
<p>are still wearing them</p>
<p>until they hit herd immunity officially,</p>
<p>which I know you could roll your eyes at, David.</p>
<p>But, you know, they did have a-</p>
<p>It would be an equation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the real reason.</p>
<p>No, I do actually do think it&rsquo;s the real reason.</p>
<p>Because multiple people said to me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a way of showing people</p>
<p>that you actually care about them</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re going to really take this seriously</p>
<p>until the end.</p>
<p>No, I think it&rsquo;s more what Ezra Klein said,</p>
<p>which is this is the red MAGA hat for Team Blue.</p>
<p>This is pure virtue signaling.</p>
<p>Possible.</p>
<p>The other thing they said was on a practical basis,</p>
<p>in New York, you&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>on the subway, your office,</p>
<p>and in, you know, going into a cafe,</p>
<p>you have to wear it,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing that 17 times a day.</p>
<p>So taking the mask on and off</p>
<p>just becomes less work than just leaving it on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, those were reasonable answers I got.</p>
<p>But anyway, somebody summarize the story.</p>
<p>Another reason I think is that,</p>
<p>look, if you&rsquo;re in a blue part of the country,</p>
<p>the media sources for Team Blue</p>
<p>are still promoting this idea</p>
<p>that outdoor spread is a thing,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a risk.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re finally now getting,</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve known since last summer</p>
<p>that there were no cases,</p>
<p>no documented cases of casual outdoor spread</p>
<p>anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The Atlantic was reporting on this, okay?</p>
<p>This is not a conservative publication.</p>
<p>This is a liberal, a skew liberal publication.</p>
<p>Liberal leaning.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve known since last summer,</p>
<p>I mean, when Gavin Newsom declared</p>
<p>that we weren&rsquo;t allowed to go to the beach,</p>
<p>it was widely mocked.</p>
<p>And so only now is the CDC getting around</p>
<p>to loosening its guidance on outdoor mask wearing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still not loose enough.</p>
<p>And so there was a great article</p>
<p>by David Leonard in the New York Times</p>
<p>that just came out, I think yesterday</p>
<p>or two days ago,</p>
<p>about the cautious CDC.</p>
<p>And what he said is,</p>
<p>by the way, this just validates</p>
<p>everything we&rsquo;ve been saying on the pod</p>
<p>for the last few months.</p>
<p>Leonard chronicles the sort of absurdly</p>
<p>conservative guidance given by the CDC.</p>
<p>Basically, the CDC continues to suggest</p>
<p>that outdoor transmission accounts</p>
<p>for up to 10% of cases,</p>
<p>when the real number is certainly under 1%,</p>
<p>is probably under 0.1%.</p>
<p>And this is all based on a single study</p>
<p>in Singapore that was misclassified.</p>
<p>It was based on a construction site</p>
<p>that really wasn&rsquo;t even an outdoor spread.</p>
<p>And yet the CDC still insists</p>
<p>that unvaccinated people need</p>
<p>to wear masks outdoors,</p>
<p>that vaccinated people wear them</p>
<p>in large public values,</p>
<p>and that children at summer camp</p>
<p>wear them at all times.</p>
<p>This is the current CDC guidance.</p>
<p>And so yesterday, when the head of the CDC</p>
<p>was pulled in front of a congressional hearing</p>
<p>and asked about this,</p>
<p>she doubled down on this less than 10%.</p>
<p>And the reason why it&rsquo;s so misleading</p>
<p>is technically speaking,</p>
<p>less than 10% is correct.</p>
<p>But when the real number is 0.001%</p>
<p>or something like that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s highly misleading to give 10%.</p>
<p>And the reason-</p>
<p>The line in the article, which I loved is,</p>
<p>it is accurate to say that sharks eat</p>
<p>less than 200,000 humans a year.</p>
<p>But it is also more accurate to say</p>
<p>sharks attack 150 humans a year.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And 150 is very different than 200,000.</p>
<p>But if you say sharks attack,</p>
<p>you know, 200,000 people or less a year,</p>
<p>you would think that it&rsquo;s a much bigger problem</p>
<p>than it actually is.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the whole point,</p>
<p>which is, we&rsquo;re not being scientific,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re being emotional and reactive.</p>
<p>And the paper that Leonard references,</p>
<p>basically, they took this data</p>
<p>that identified how spread was occurring empirically,</p>
<p>and identifying, you know, through tracing,</p>
<p>you know, where are people actually picking up COVID.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really where this empirical evidence suggests,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about a less than 0.1%</p>
<p>casual outdoor spread rate.</p>
<p>And you can see that empirically</p>
<p>in the data.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s also this deterministic kind of approach</p>
<p>where you could say, like, look, how does spread happen?</p>
<p>Spread happens with viruses.</p>
<p>We know that viruses need to live in liquid</p>
<p>in order to survive when you&rsquo;re outdoors.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s any amount of wind or UV light,</p>
<p>the virus can very quickly degrade,</p>
<p>the protein can degrade, the RNA doesn&rsquo;t transfer.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a deterministic rationale</p>
<p>for scientific rationale for why that may be the case.</p>
<p>And this evidence that this paper,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve now shared, kind of gathers together</p>
<p>shows that, you know, that is indeed</p>
<p>what the statistics are showing.</p>
<p>And so yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>But I think the precautionary principle,</p>
<p>David, is where the argument would be made</p>
<p>on the other side, which is, you know,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the cost of wearing a mask</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s any risk at all?</p>
<p>And by the way, I&rsquo;m not making this case personally,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s where a lot of people</p>
<p>would make the counter argument.</p>
<p>Rather than debate the facts and the evidence</p>
<p>and the science, they would say,</p>
<p>but who cares?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a mask.</p>
<p>Why does that matter?</p>
<p>And so I think the question is,</p>
<p>why does it matter, right?</p>
<p>Like, why does it matter if they&rsquo;re telling us</p>
<p>to wear masks?</p>
<p>Is there really that much of a cost</p>
<p>to people to do that?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, if people are doing it voluntarily,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s their right to do so.</p>
<p>But the question is mass mandate.</p>
<p>Should we continue to have mandates</p>
<p>on the population for something</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t necessary?</p>
<p>And look, I was one of the first people</p>
<p>in March of 2000 to call for</p>
<p>mass wearing and mass mandates</p>
<p>because we were seeing the data</p>
<p>out of the Asian countries</p>
<p>showing that they were effective.</p>
<p>They were high cost or high benefit,</p>
<p>low cost.</p>
<p>So I was in favor of it</p>
<p>when there was a pandemic raging.</p>
<p>But when T zero, the rate of transmission</p>
<p>is in free fall everywhere,</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;ve learned that outdoor spread</p>
<p>is not an issue,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t support restricting people&rsquo;s freedom.</p>
<p>And if, you know, for a reason</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not rooted in science.</p>
<p>And, you know, the problem</p>
<p>with the CDC guidance</p>
<p>is that people really act on it.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got politicians,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got local jurisdictions</p>
<p>who will not do schools.</p>
<p>I mean, so the schools</p>
<p>have remained closed.</p>
<p>And by the way, the schools have been open</p>
<p>in Texas and Florida for six months.</p>
<p>We know based on empirical data</p>
<p>in the real world,</p>
<p>seeing what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in Texas and Florida,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not seeing an increase</p>
<p>in COVID cases in those places</p>
<p>because of school reopening.</p>
<p>And yet the CDC has not moved</p>
<p>its guidance on school reopening.</p>
<p>You have summer camps now</p>
<p>that for liability reasons</p>
<p>will make kids wear masks</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t take the risk</p>
<p>of getting sued.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got politicians</p>
<p>like Gavin Newsom</p>
<p>who won&rsquo;t wipe their ass</p>
<p>without the CDC&rsquo;s</p>
<p>permission to do so.</p>
<p>So it has a real consequence</p>
<p>in the real world</p>
<p>that the CDC is stuck</p>
<p>on this ridiculous guidance.</p>
<p>Did we read the actual sentence</p>
<p>from the New York Times</p>
<p>about under 10%?</p>
<p>So you could read it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s really sad, actually.</p>
<p>Just in terms of</p>
<p>the misleading CDC numbers,</p>
<p>they said, in quotes,</p>
<p>under 10% of the spread</p>
<p>has occurred outside.</p>
<p>When in reality,</p>
<p>the share of transmission</p>
<p>that occurred outdoors</p>
<p>seems to be below 1%</p>
<p>and maybe below 0.1%</p>
<p>multiple epidemiologists told me.</p>
<p>Right. Well, also read the quote.</p>
<p>This is directly from David Leonard</p>
<p>of the New York Times.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s important to,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>when you can quote</p>
<p>the New York Times</p>
<p>or the Atlantic</p>
<p>because these are</p>
<p>left-leaning publications.</p>
<p>So Team Blue should be</p>
<p>more willing to accept them.</p>
<p>What Leonard said is</p>
<p>there is not a single</p>
<p>documented COVID infection</p>
<p>anywhere in the world</p>
<p>from casual outdoor interactions.</p>
<p>But do people know that?</p>
<p>I mean, do the people</p>
<p>walking down the street</p>
<p>with masks on know that?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll know it now</p>
<p>because according,</p>
<p>by the way, did you guys know?</p>
<p>Jason just told me this.</p>
<p>We accumulate a million</p>
<p>views slash listens</p>
<p>a week to our podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah, now the archive&rsquo;s growing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So now a million people</p>
<p>will at least know.</p>
<p>I mean, at least.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit self-selective.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s be honest.</p>
<p>Yeah, for intelligence.</p>
<p>I mean, the people weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>But the real question is like,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t this an opportunity</p>
<p>for the CDC to actually</p>
<p>reestablish some credibility,</p>
<p>which is to say, OK,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to get back to facts.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to.</p>
<p>We are not.</p>
<p>We know that people will be prone</p>
<p>to acting on anecdote and emotion.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>grounded in truth.</p>
<p>In fact, we went back.</p>
<p>We looked at the Singapore study.</p>
<p>Here are the flaws in it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it applies.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re going to own it</p>
<p>and revise it.</p>
<p>And that would go such a long way.</p>
<p>The fact is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to understand,</p>
<p>like, what do you think</p>
<p>the incentives are for them</p>
<p>to keep doubling down</p>
<p>on bad decision making?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no downside.</p>
<p>I think I said this.</p>
<p>I think I said this a few months ago,</p>
<p>which is I don&rsquo;t think that the CDC</p>
<p>or any kind of medical,</p>
<p>you know, administrative</p>
<p>group in particular</p>
<p>has to think about</p>
<p>the synthesis of the effects</p>
<p>of some of the policy</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re recommending.</p>
<p>Their objective is to save lives.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m running the CDC,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell people,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t leave your home ever.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t drink alcohol.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t eat red meat exercise.</p>
<p>You have to exercise 60 minutes a day</p>
<p>or you get taxed.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of things</p>
<p>that you could see</p>
<p>if you were purely focused</p>
<p>on saving lives,</p>
<p>you would make specific recommendations</p>
<p>only to save lives</p>
<p>without thinking about</p>
<p>the consequences</p>
<p>outside of saving lives.</p>
<p>The consequences outside of saving lives</p>
<p>of telling people to wear masks</p>
<p>is it minimizes economic activity,</p>
<p>some might argue.</p>
<p>Therefore, there&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>an impact on airlines</p>
<p>and hotels and outdoor</p>
<p>thing and spending</p>
<p>and all this other people</p>
<p>being willing to go to work</p>
<p>and people being afraid</p>
<p>of being in the office.</p>
<p>I mean, I see this.</p>
<p>I see this across</p>
<p>all my companies</p>
<p>where people,</p>
<p>even though they&rsquo;re vaccinated</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re scientists,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re afraid to go to work.</p>
<p>And so, you know,</p>
<p>part of the perpetuation</p>
<p>of the fear that arises</p>
<p>from these policies</p>
<p>that are all about</p>
<p>the absolute saving of any life</p>
<p>is that you end up</p>
<p>having a significant cost</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not related</p>
<p>to the objectives</p>
<p>of that particular</p>
<p>medical organization.</p>
<p>And we see it around the world.</p>
<p>Sorry, this just goes back</p>
<p>to what I said about leadership.</p>
<p>A few episodes ago,</p>
<p>which is the leadership</p>
<p>of the administration</p>
<p>should be synthesizing</p>
<p>the recommendation</p>
<p>of that group,</p>
<p>along with the effect</p>
<p>that other groups</p>
<p>might be indicating</p>
<p>would arise from</p>
<p>that recommendation</p>
<p>and coming up with</p>
<p>a kind of concrete,</p>
<p>you know, kind of objective</p>
<p>around, okay, well,</p>
<p>how do we balance these</p>
<p>these different effects?</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>is absolutely correct.</p>
<p>The people who are</p>
<p>making the decisions</p>
<p>are only thinking about</p>
<p>their responsibility.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a secret</p>
<p>service agent</p>
<p>when the president&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>can I go out and sign</p>
<p>autographs?</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to say no,</p>
<p>because they are responsible</p>
<p>for keeping the president alive.</p>
<p>Now, the other</p>
<p>pernicious thing about this</p>
<p>is they kept trying</p>
<p>to game the public</p>
<p>and the public</p>
<p>when you try to game</p>
<p>the public and you get caught</p>
<p>where they say don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Fauci says don&rsquo;t wear a mask</p>
<p>because he doesn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to run out of masks.</p>
<p>Then they say,</p>
<p>keep the masks on</p>
<p>because they want to,</p>
<p>you know, virtue signal</p>
<p>or whatever it is,</p>
<p>or they won&rsquo;t simply say</p>
<p>the vaccine is not dangerous</p>
<p>or that the vaccine</p>
<p>is actually going to</p>
<p>keep you from dying.</p>
<p>They undersold the vaccine</p>
<p>and now everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to question</p>
<p>everything they do</p>
<p>for all time.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t manage us.</p>
<p>Manage the facts.</p>
<p>Stop trying to manage people</p>
<p>and just start managing</p>
<p>your communication</p>
<p>and make it crisp</p>
<p>and clear.</p>
<p>And then somebody</p>
<p>has to be a goddamn</p>
<p>leader and say,</p>
<p>OK, the doctors</p>
<p>are saying this.</p>
<p>The economy is saying this.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s how those</p>
<p>two things overlap.</p>
<p>In schools being closed</p>
<p>means more suicide</p>
<p>in kids,</p>
<p>more depression in kids,</p>
<p>and people not being</p>
<p>able to put food</p>
<p>on their tables</p>
<p>means we&rsquo;re going to create</p>
<p>who knows what</p>
<p>this economic policy</p>
<p>is going to create,</p>
<p>which is another segue.</p>
<p>David, you had something to say.</p>
<p>Well, look, I agree with that,</p>
<p>but I think you guys</p>
<p>are being a little bit</p>
<p>too charitable to the CDC.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just that they&rsquo;re wrong</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not just that</p>
<p>they have a bureaucratic</p>
<p>incentive for CYA</p>
<p>and to be too conservative</p>
<p>in their guidance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fact that when</p>
<p>an error gets pointed out,</p>
<p>like by David Leonhard</p>
<p>in the New York Times,</p>
<p>they double down on the lie.</p>
<p>And so, Leonhard</p>
<p>followed up his article.</p>
<p>It happened.</p>
<p>So, go to this tweet</p>
<p>that I just put in the chat.</p>
<p>He said,</p>
<p>at a Senate hearing today,</p>
<p>Senator Collins asked</p>
<p>CDC Director Dr. Walensky</p>
<p>about today&rsquo;s edition</p>
<p>of Morning,</p>
<p>which was his article,</p>
<p>which explains why the CDC&rsquo;s claim</p>
<p>that less than 10% of COVID</p>
<p>transmission is misleading.</p>
<p>And Walensky then doubles down</p>
<p>and has a bunch of excuses</p>
<p>and basically defends</p>
<p>this 10% number,</p>
<p>which is a lie.</p>
<p>Now, why would the CDC</p>
<p>be doing this?</p>
<p>There was separate reporting</p>
<p>by the New York Post.</p>
<p>Go to this article</p>
<p>on teachers&rsquo; unions</p>
<p>collaborated with the CDC</p>
<p>on school reopenings.</p>
<p>So, this guidance</p>
<p>that the CDC put forward</p>
<p>on school reopenings,</p>
<p>the teachers&rsquo; unions</p>
<p>were part of writing</p>
<p>that guidance.</p>
<p>And all of their suggestions</p>
<p>were actually accepted</p>
<p>and incorporated by the CDC.</p>
<p>Now, how is this science?</p>
<p>This is politics.</p>
<p>Last year,</p>
<p>there were a bunch of articles</p>
<p>accusing the Trump administration</p>
<p>of incorporating,</p>
<p>you know, political considerations</p>
<p>into their guidance.</p>
<p>There were huge scandals about this.</p>
<p>Where is the reporting today</p>
<p>about the influence</p>
<p>that the teachers&rsquo; unions</p>
<p>are wielding over the CDC</p>
<p>to deliberately keep schools closed,</p>
<p>even though the science</p>
<p>does not support that?</p>
<p>This is a gigantic scandal,</p>
<p>and yet no one&rsquo;s covering it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s left for the New York Post</p>
<p>to cover this</p>
<p>instead of the New York Times.</p>
<p>By the way, I think</p>
<p>this is a good transition</p>
<p>to that Druckenmiller interview,</p>
<p>because, you know,</p>
<p>Saxe, I just retweeted</p>
<p>what you had sent,</p>
<p>which was a link to the video</p>
<p>interview.</p>
<p>So, you know, Stanley Druckenmiller</p>
<p>is this incredible investor.</p>
<p>Goat.</p>
<p>G-O-A-T, goat.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many stories</p>
<p>about Druckenmiller.</p>
<p>At one point, you know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the guy that notoriously,</p>
<p>they say, broke the Bank of England,</p>
<p>where he was betting</p>
<p>against the British pound</p>
<p>and forced the central bankers</p>
<p>in the UK to devalue the pound.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s made billions of dollars</p>
<p>managing initially George Soros&rsquo; money</p>
<p>and then spun off</p>
<p>and runs his own money now</p>
<p>as an investor.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s a macro guy.</p>
<p>So he thinks about kind of</p>
<p>macroeconomic conditions and effects.</p>
<p>And he talks a lot about Fed policy.</p>
<p>So he gave this interview on CNBC.</p>
<p>And I think the, you know,</p>
<p>the most kind of prescient quote,</p>
<p>and it was also based on an op-ed</p>
<p>he wrote, right, Saxe,</p>
<p>in the Wall Street Journal?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But the interview is fantastic.</p>
<p>The TV interview is great.</p>
<p>Just watch that.</p>
<p>The interview is great.</p>
<p>And he said, in the write up,</p>
<p>he said, clinging to an emergency</p>
<p>after the emergency has passed</p>
<p>is what the Fed behavior</p>
<p>indicates right now.</p>
<p>And I think that, you know,</p>
<p>kind of what we&rsquo;re talking about broadly</p>
<p>is perhaps the emergency</p>
<p>in the United States</p>
<p>where you have this uncontrolled</p>
<p>increase in COVID cases.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the case today.</p>
<p>So the emergency has passed.</p>
<p>We still have COVID,</p>
<p>but it is not an emergency.</p>
<p>And the point is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of institutions</p>
<p>and individuals and businesses</p>
<p>that are still operating</p>
<p>as if we were in the throes</p>
<p>of the emergency.</p>
<p>And so Druckenmiller is making the case</p>
<p>that the Fed,</p>
<p>and the Fed policy is acting</p>
<p>as if we&rsquo;re in an emergency.</p>
<p>But broadly, we&rsquo;re seeing this</p>
<p>across a lot of institutions</p>
<p>like the teachers unions and others</p>
<p>where people are effectively,</p>
<p>you know, never let a good emergency</p>
<p>go by without taking advantage</p>
<p>or whatever the saying is.</p>
<p>Never waste a crisis.</p>
<p>Never waste a crisis.</p>
<p>And the crisis,</p>
<p>keep the crisis going</p>
<p>is kind of the model</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s in right now.</p>
<p>Milk the crisis.</p>
<p>Milk the crisis.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re keeping it going</p>
<p>as long as they can.</p>
<p>And Druckenmiller gave</p>
<p>some pretty amazing quotes.</p>
<p>He said that, well, first of all,</p>
<p>he described our current</p>
<p>monetary fiscal policy</p>
<p>as being the most radical</p>
<p>he had ever seen.</p>
<p>And this guy&rsquo;s been watching markets</p>
<p>for decades.</p>
<p>The Fed has pumped 2.5 trillion</p>
<p>of QE into the economy</p>
<p>post-vaccine,</p>
<p>post-retail recovery.</p>
<p>He said that right now,</p>
<p>retail demand is five years</p>
<p>above trend,</p>
<p>meaning not only has retail demand</p>
<p>fully recovered,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s where,</p>
<p>if you look at the trend line,</p>
<p>it would be five years from now.</p>
<p>So they are pumping</p>
<p>demand like crazy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve issued 6 trillion</p>
<p>of new debt.</p>
<p>And then this is the thing</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know at all.</p>
<p>He said the Fed is buying</p>
<p>60 percent of new debt issues.</p>
<p>Without this,</p>
<p>the bond market would be</p>
<p>rejecting this massive</p>
<p>fiscal expansion</p>
<p>because interest rates</p>
<p>would become prohibitive.</p>
<p>And he said that when</p>
<p>interest rates revert to the norm,</p>
<p>the historical norm,</p>
<p>interest expense on our debt</p>
<p>will be 30 percent</p>
<p>of the government budget.</p>
<p>So, I mean, think about that.</p>
<p>Look, the markets</p>
<p>have had to intervene</p>
<p>and we have essentially decoupled</p>
<p>what the government</p>
<p>thinks is happening</p>
<p>with what the capital markets</p>
<p>needs people to know.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a really unique dynamic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not nearly as successful as Stan</p>
<p>or have been in the markets</p>
<p>as long as him,</p>
<p>but in my 20 years,</p>
<p>this is the first time</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve really seen that.</p>
<p>So just to give you a sense of this,</p>
<p>the markets are now</p>
<p>acting to establish</p>
<p>inflation expectations</p>
<p>that the Fed just seems to not</p>
<p>want to do anything about.</p>
<p>And what was so for</p>
<p>just to give you guys</p>
<p>a sense of this,</p>
<p>like, you know, when in February,</p>
<p>the markets really kind of</p>
<p>had its first capitulation.</p>
<p>What happened was that</p>
<p>all of a sudden people digested</p>
<p>all these facts that Stan just said</p>
<p>and realized, wait a minute,</p>
<p>like all of this money</p>
<p>is going to drive prices higher.</p>
<p>And so what they did was</p>
<p>they took the yield</p>
<p>on the 10 year bond</p>
<p>up by like 100 basis points</p>
<p>and the markets freaked out.</p>
<p>They went from like 0.75 to 1.75.</p>
<p>And the Fed came out and said,</p>
<p>hey, hold on, nothing to see here.</p>
<p>This is everything&rsquo;s going to be fine.</p>
<p>But then everything since then</p>
<p>has been sort of leading</p>
<p>to this realization.</p>
<p>Commodity prices are up 50%.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this kind of like joke</p>
<p>that like, you know,</p>
<p>you see a bed of lumber</p>
<p>moving across a railroad.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a billion dollars of lumber</p>
<p>just because of how expensive it is.</p>
<p>You know, there are shortages everywhere.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be shocked to know that today</p>
<p>Chipotle put out the following guidance,</p>
<p>which is they said they are</p>
<p>increasing the minimum wage to $15</p>
<p>and that within three years</p>
<p>you can make $100,000 a year at Chipotle.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That is as much as some engineers</p>
<p>and coders in the United States.</p>
<p>Dara Khorshashouy, the CEO of Uber</p>
<p>said on the Uber earnings call last week</p>
<p>that the average hourly rate</p>
<p>that some drivers in New York,</p>
<p>Uber drivers in New York were getting paid</p>
<p>was $38 an hour.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>$38 an hour.</p>
<p>So what does all of this mean?</p>
<p>I think what Stan is trying to say</p>
<p>$100,000 a year.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re in this weird place</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;ve decoupled</p>
<p>the government institution</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s responsible for fiscal stability.</p>
<p>And then the overall capital markets</p>
<p>used to work in tandem</p>
<p>and they are no longer working in tandem</p>
<p>because you have a narrative</p>
<p>and a set of data points</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t supported by the facts.</p>
<p>And so this is an interesting thing.</p>
<p>So in the CDC versus</p>
<p>the American people example,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way to push back, right?</p>
<p>I mean, governors can act independently.</p>
<p>Cities will act independently.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>you know, the teachers unions</p>
<p>are working with the CDC.</p>
<p>The school camps have this guidance</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re stuck in this morass.</p>
<p>In the capital markets,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not necessarily true.</p>
<p>And so you can change</p>
<p>and you can re-rate asset prices</p>
<p>based on sentiment.</p>
<p>And I think what everybody is saying</p>
<p>in this example is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re past the emergency.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve put too much money in the economy.</p>
<p>We need to reopen.</p>
<p>And we now need to face the fact</p>
<p>that there are massively rising prices,</p>
<p>which means that there will be inflation.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t act,</p>
<p>the capital markets</p>
<p>will continue to act for us.</p>
<p>And so this is an example today</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re just seeing</p>
<p>a bloodbath in the markets.</p>
<p>And by the way,</p>
<p>the only time the two government officials</p>
<p>tried to be on either side,</p>
<p>Janet Yellen last Friday,</p>
<p>kind of casually in an interview,</p>
<p>kind of put her toe out in the water</p>
<p>as Treasury Secretary</p>
<p>and kind of said something</p>
<p>that said there could be inflation</p>
<p>and literally was hand slapped</p>
<p>and had to put out something</p>
<p>that disavowed her comments</p>
<p>less than 24 hours later.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where we are.</p>
<p>There is a bloodbath</p>
<p>in the markets today.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been one</p>
<p>for the last couple of months.</p>
<p>And in particular,</p>
<p>all the growth stocks have been hammered.</p>
<p>And just to build on</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying, Chamath,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s an announcement today,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some data that the inflation,</p>
<p>the CPI is up 4% and climbing.</p>
<p>And so people are now pricing in</p>
<p>big interest rate increases.</p>
<p>And so that makes growth stock,</p>
<p>that hammers growth stocks</p>
<p>because all the earnings</p>
<p>are in the distant future.</p>
<p>And so they get now</p>
<p>discounted at a higher rate.</p>
<p>And so the valuations</p>
<p>get absolutely hammered.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s absolutely souring.</p>
<p>The markets are basically souring</p>
<p>on this Biden agenda.</p>
<p>And, you know, I just, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to wonder</p>
<p>if Biden&rsquo;s going to be a Jimmy Carter here,</p>
<p>because frankly, all he had to do</p>
<p>was leave things well enough alone.</p>
<p>COVID was winding down.</p>
<p>We had a vaccine.</p>
<p>All they had to do was distribute it</p>
<p>to as many people as possible,</p>
<p>end COVID, let the recovery take shape.</p>
<p>And instead they push this insane</p>
<p>$10 trillion agenda of taxes and spending</p>
<p>that are now overstimulating the economy</p>
<p>that are causing inflation</p>
<p>that are now creating interest rate increases.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not true yet.</p>
<p>Meaning he did do a good job</p>
<p>on the vaccine, David.</p>
<p>But then to your point,</p>
<p>the federal government&rsquo;s posture</p>
<p>on reopening is still been stunted.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s proposing so much</p>
<p>more incremental capital,</p>
<p>which we all know probably</p>
<p>will not be efficiently spent.</p>
<p>And there isn&rsquo;t any other good ideas.</p>
<p>And so he believes his path</p>
<p>to reelection, which is true,</p>
<p>is to spend and to put money</p>
<p>to put money to the economy.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to backfire.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to backfire massively.</p>
<p>And to tax, right?</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s the spending,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s trying to offset with higher taxes</p>
<p>on the wealthy, which, you know,</p>
<p>from his point of view</p>
<p>is not going to affect him.</p>
<p>And the analysis is probably fair.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to affect</p>
<p>his his voter block.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to backfire massively.</p>
<p>Look, if the economy turns,</p>
<p>we were set for a post COVID boom.</p>
<p>And right now that is all at risk</p>
<p>because like you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re keeping the economy closed</p>
<p>or parts of it way too long.</p>
<p>They then overcompensate for that</p>
<p>by printing a ton of money.</p>
<p>And then they overcompensate for that</p>
<p>by raising taxes too much.</p>
<p>Just to build on that.</p>
<p>So that second step</p>
<p>of their overcompensating</p>
<p>their inability to open</p>
<p>with money is so true.</p>
<p>Because then what happens</p>
<p>is your labor force stays impaired</p>
<p>because people make enough money</p>
<p>by not working.</p>
<p>This is the key issue right now</p>
<p>for a lot of businesses.</p>
<p>I mean, you have restaurants</p>
<p>that are overbooked, cannot get servers.</p>
<p>Jim Cramer was saying he&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s up to $18, you know,</p>
<p>per hour per servers,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going to move it to 20.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t make a difference</p>
<p>because with that extra 300,</p>
<p>I think in federal,</p>
<p>federal unemployment,</p>
<p>plus three to 700,</p>
<p>I think, depending on where you are,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re now at 60, 70, 80%.</p>
<p>And people are like,</p>
<p>well, people will still go to work.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>yeah, but you&rsquo;re saving commuting</p>
<p>and you probably have side hustles</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve lowered your commute expense.</p>
<p>So what is going to incentivize people</p>
<p>to go back to work?</p>
<p>We are now running a dry run</p>
<p>with cryptocurrency and,</p>
<p>you know, stimulus,</p>
<p>a UBI experiment.</p>
<p>And the result of this UBI experiment</p>
<p>is negative economic growth</p>
<p>or throttled economic growth.</p>
<p>We cannot be productive</p>
<p>if people don&rsquo;t want to work and contribute.</p>
<p>So just to your point,</p>
<p>we need more people to go to work.</p>
<p>So just to your point on Friday,</p>
<p>Montana, which was part</p>
<p>of the federal government&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>pandemic related UI benefits program,</p>
<p>basically said that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re canceling those benefits</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re opting out.</p>
<p>And on top of that,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re now offering</p>
<p>a $1,200 bonus to return to work.</p>
<p>And the problem is</p>
<p>because Montana now</p>
<p>has a severe labor shortage,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not just Montana.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s every state in the union.</p>
<p>So we have these two opposing forces, right?</p>
<p>We have so much stimulus.</p>
<p>We have an under motivated labor force.</p>
<p>We have more taxation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also just going to be wasted.</p>
<p>So very poor ROI.</p>
<p>And then now we have input costs going up</p>
<p>and prices going up</p>
<p>to try to attract people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all going to drive.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the quote from</p>
<p>the governor of Mississippi.</p>
<p>The purpose of unemployment benefits</p>
<p>is to temporarily assist</p>
<p>Mississippians who are unemployed</p>
<p>through no fault of their own.</p>
<p>After many conversations</p>
<p>over the last several weeks</p>
<p>with Mississippi,</p>
<p>small business owners</p>
<p>and their employees,</p>
<p>it has become clear</p>
<p>that the pandemic unemployment assistance</p>
<p>and other like programs</p>
<p>passed by the Congress</p>
<p>may have been necessary</p>
<p>in May of last year,</p>
<p>but are no longer.</p>
<p>So in May of this year,</p>
<p>and can you imagine</p>
<p>the hit you&rsquo;re going to take</p>
<p>from voters,</p>
<p>from woke mobs,</p>
<p>from people who believe</p>
<p>in income inequality,</p>
<p>when you say,</p>
<p>I think we have to stop</p>
<p>sending people free money</p>
<p>so they go back to work,</p>
<p>like this is a very hard</p>
<p>position to take.</p>
<p>And we now have this occurring</p>
<p>on a micro basis in California.</p>
<p>We have a is it true</p>
<p>we have a $75 billion surplus this year</p>
<p>as the city devolves?</p>
<p>Yeah, now we&rsquo;re going to take that.</p>
<p>And instead of lowering taxes</p>
<p>and maybe trying to get Tesla</p>
<p>or Oracle or other venture</p>
<p>capital firms that have left</p>
<p>instead of doing that,</p>
<p>what would be what could we do,</p>
<p>David, with that $75 billion?</p>
<p>OK, well, OK, so great point.</p>
<p>So the $75 billion surplus,</p>
<p>one third of that</p>
<p>is from the federal bailout,</p>
<p>which obviously we don&rsquo;t need.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the money printing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming out of Washington.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re giving that back, right,</p>
<p>to another state that could use it?</p>
<p>Good luck, exactly.</p>
<p>No, the other two thirds</p>
<p>is because last year</p>
<p>we had all these unexpected tax receipts</p>
<p>from the stock market boom.</p>
<p>And so you had all these</p>
<p>California taxpayers</p>
<p>paying capital gains on that.</p>
<p>So but what this highlights to me is,</p>
<p>and what I wonder about</p>
<p>is how many of those taxpayers</p>
<p>have left the state?</p>
<p>Because we know that we had net</p>
<p>migration loss of 182,000 in 2020.</p>
<p>So how many of those people</p>
<p>left the state and won&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>paying taxes this year?</p>
<p>And if Biden breaks the stock market</p>
<p>through this insane tax and spend,</p>
<p>then where is this surplus</p>
<p>going to come from next year?</p>
<p>And what this highlights to me is</p>
<p>I think we have people in Washington</p>
<p>and Sacramento, for that matter,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve lost sight of the fact</p>
<p>that ultimately the private sector</p>
<p>and the public sector are a partnership</p>
<p>because the private sector generates</p>
<p>the largesse and the wealth</p>
<p>to fund the public sector</p>
<p>and to fund the creation</p>
<p>of these public goods,</p>
<p>to fund education,</p>
<p>to fund law and order,</p>
<p>to fund social programs.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve stopped seeing it that way.</p>
<p>They see the private sector</p>
<p>not as something like a cow to be milked</p>
<p>or a sheep to be sheared,</p>
<p>but they want to skin the sheep</p>
<p>instead of shearing it.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re really at risk</p>
<p>or killing the golden goose,</p>
<p>I guess you could put it that way.</p>
<p>And I think that during the Clinton years,</p>
<p>just to take a contrast,</p>
<p>we had government spending,</p>
<p>federal government spending</p>
<p>as a percent of GDP</p>
<p>was between 8.5% and 22%.</p>
<p>That was the range.</p>
<p>And we had a boom.</p>
<p>So when you have a federal spending</p>
<p>as a percent of GDP around 20%,</p>
<p>it works, right?</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t increase government spending.</p>
<p>It just means that government spending</p>
<p>will increase as the economy gets bigger.</p>
<p>But what you have now</p>
<p>is federal spending over 30% of GDP</p>
<p>and everything is starting to break.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>Very, very big problem.</p>
<p>And of course&hellip;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>getting red-pilled, right?</p>
<p>How many people in Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>frankly, who make a living</p>
<p>off gross stocks</p>
<p>are now starting to scratch their heads</p>
<p>going, gee, what did I vote for?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely becoming a thing.</p>
<p>And I would say the purple pill party,</p>
<p>you know, like chop it up.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s mix these two things.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s candy flip, whatever it takes</p>
<p>like to get out of this,</p>
<p>you know, we got to get this party restarted.</p>
<p>Centrism is the answer.</p>
<p>It absolutely is.</p>
<p>And, you know&hellip;</p>
<p>Centrism is the answer.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s probably good</p>
<p>for us to take a pause here</p>
<p>and maybe talk about this</p>
<p>Business Insider hit piece</p>
<p>or what was likely to be a hit piece.</p>
<p>But turned out, I think,</p>
<p>on Emerging Fair,</p>
<p>calling this all-in podcast.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if this is accurate,</p>
<p>but I thought it was pretty funny.</p>
<p>Possibly the single most disruptive click</p>
<p>in California politics this year.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re referring to the four of us.</p>
<p>And then, of course,</p>
<p>I get absolutely skewered</p>
<p>for making clucking noises.</p>
<p>I own those clucks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud of those clucks.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll say.</p>
<p>Can I say something?</p>
<p>I think that, look, our&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little exhausted</p>
<p>about local politics</p>
<p>and California politics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exhausted by federal politics</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s an important lens,</p>
<p>as David said,</p>
<p>into like how we actually conduct business</p>
<p>because all of the businesses</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re involved with</p>
<p>are inherently global</p>
<p>and America leads.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll say, though,</p>
<p>about that article,</p>
<p>which I didn&rsquo;t read,</p>
<p>like most of these things,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t really read.</p>
<p>Never read your press.</p>
<p>Rule number one in the game.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s incredibly important</p>
<p>to realize that California</p>
<p>was a bellwether for opportunity</p>
<p>and the ideals of American upward mobility.</p>
<p>And a lot of people came here</p>
<p>irrespective of the taxes</p>
<p>because they sought out like-minded people.</p>
<p>They sought out a moderate liberal viewpoint</p>
<p>and an economic set of opportunities.</p>
<p>Two of those three boundary conditions</p>
<p>are changing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think California</p>
<p>is now important</p>
<p>because it is a canary in the coal mine</p>
<p>for the rest of the United States,</p>
<p>which is,</p>
<p>do we become a balkanized country of 50 states</p>
<p>or are there like generic, progressive,</p>
<p>moderate ideals</p>
<p>that everybody can agree to and sign up to</p>
<p>and where governments largely still get out of the way?</p>
<p>This, like, I don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>you know, if you look at sort of like tech oligopolists</p>
<p>and the hatred we have for them,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think political oligopolists are any better.</p>
<p>And so, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we want either of them in charge</p>
<p>is really the answer.</p>
<p>And so, we just got to use this election cycle,</p>
<p>I think, to kind of like vote a moderate agenda,</p>
<p>the most disruptive thing that can happen in California</p>
<p>is somebody emerges who is rational and moderate,</p>
<p>who says,</p>
<p>you can categorize me as a Republican or Democrat</p>
<p>on a whole bunch of issues.</p>
<p>I had to pick a platform</p>
<p>because the stupid election model makes me pick one.</p>
<p>So call me a Democrat or call me a Republican,</p>
<p>but the reality is I&rsquo;m a centrist.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I believe.</p>
<p>And if that person gets voted in,</p>
<p>then hopefully it changes the conversation</p>
<p>for the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we are headed to 50 balkanized states</p>
<p>operating independently.</p>
<p>And Jason, the thing where you make a joke</p>
<p>is actually kind of sad.</p>
<p>If you get $25 billion and you don&rsquo;t need it,</p>
<p>the ideal thing is that you actually give it back</p>
<p>to the federal government</p>
<p>because you think there&rsquo;s some accountability</p>
<p>for all these dollars</p>
<p>and it actually is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>And the fact that everybody laughs</p>
<p>because we know, no, of course not.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d rather just dig a ditch and fill a ditch for 25 billion</p>
<p>or, you know, two and a half miles of high speed rail,</p>
<p>whatever the crazy thing is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of sad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad and it&rsquo;s corrupt, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a corruption.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a corruption that we&rsquo;ve just gotten used to,</p>
<p>which is you&rsquo;re going to take 26 billion</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t need, that you don&rsquo;t deserve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the school board in San Francisco announcing</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to open school for one day</p>
<p>to qualify for incentives for reopening</p>
<p>that Gavin Newsom gave them for 12 million bucks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pure money grab.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s outrageous.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s all about the Benjamins for these guys.</p>
<p>And by that, I do not mean students named Benjamin.</p>
<p>Wow, there you go, folks.</p>
<p>David Sachs punching it up on the next SNL.</p>
<p>I wonder why he didn&rsquo;t invite you to come with him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to stick with my, I&rsquo;m not as good as you, Jason.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to stick with my day job.</p>
<p>But let me, can we go back to this article?</p>
<p>I want to give you my two cents on this article.</p>
<p>I did, you know, it was behind a paywall,</p>
<p>so it was hard to read, but I got a copy of it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my view on it.</p>
<p>First of all, I think they did pull their punches a little bit</p>
<p>because we did the pre-buttle.</p>
<p>You know, we called them out before</p>
<p>based on their very biased list of questions</p>
<p>they sent me.</p>
<p>But in any event, they kind of pulled their punches</p>
<p>a little bit, but the article was kind of suffused</p>
<p>with this, how dare they pissiness, you know?</p>
<p>And in a couple of areas, one was, you know,</p>
<p>the reporter was very upset that we&rsquo;re going direct, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about going direct,</p>
<p>meaning going around reporters</p>
<p>and speaking directly to the public.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of, well, how dare they do that?</p>
<p>You know, they should be talking through us,</p>
<p>you know, we, the objective reporters,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll tell the story for them.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re going direct.</p>
<p>We want to have an influence.</p>
<p>We want to speak our minds.</p>
<p>And the second thing they&rsquo;re upset about</p>
<p>is the fact that we&rsquo;re contributing to these elections.</p>
<p>And the reporter made a point of saying</p>
<p>that I sought out the Boudin recall.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t just come to me.</p>
<p>I sought them out and wrote $25,000</p>
<p>as if, what is he really up to?</p>
<p>Why did he seek them out?</p>
<p>Well, if you want to know what I&rsquo;m up to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about it.</p>
<p>I wrote a blog on, you know, the problem of Chase Boudin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written a blog on how Gavin Newsom</p>
<p>has moved very far to the left.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to speculate or wonder</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m up to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent thousands of words.</p>
<p>Yeah, but here&rsquo;s the problem, David.</p>
<p>David, they want you to go through them.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And the fact that this podcast has bigger reach</p>
<p>than when we go on CNBC or bigger reach</p>
<p>than we&rsquo;re in Business Insider.</p>
<p>And, you know, when the New Yorker article</p>
<p>on Chamath comes out,</p>
<p>more people will listen to this podcast</p>
<p>than read that article.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what this is about.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain threatening nature</p>
<p>to what we&rsquo;re doing here,</p>
<p>where, you know, as they admit,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re more influential than they are.</p>
<p>Well, then why read them?</p>
<p>Like, what is the point?</p>
<p>Especially if they&rsquo;re doing link baiting,</p>
<p>they look even, they look dumb</p>
<p>when compared to the dialogue we&rsquo;re having here.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t have the dialogue we&rsquo;re having here</p>
<p>because let&rsquo;s face it, we&rsquo;re four insiders.</p>
<p>We see what&rsquo;s happening on the inside.</p>
<p>And if we talk to them,</p>
<p>they might get 10 or 20% of the picture.</p>
<p>And in aggregate, they might get to 50 or 60,</p>
<p>but we get 100%.</p>
<p>Let me connect a couple of dots</p>
<p>because I think what you&rsquo;re saying is really important.</p>
<p>In my mind, I think this is another example</p>
<p>of like the CDC example</p>
<p>or the financial markets example,</p>
<p>where in all of these cases,</p>
<p>what we have is the following dynamic,</p>
<p>which is like, if you think about</p>
<p>when the newspaper used to hit your front door, right?</p>
<p>Like you used to wake up and, you know,</p>
<p>when the paper was delivered, right?</p>
<p>We all remember that.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d pick it up and it was a physical paper.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m just going to use it,</p>
<p>this number to make an example.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say it was eight and a half by 11.</p>
<p>You take this eight and a half by 11 piece of paper</p>
<p>and what you have is a fixed container.</p>
<p>And so what there was, was inherent competition.</p>
<p>And so inherently you had this leverage</p>
<p>where it was only the best things</p>
<p>that got into the paper, right?</p>
<p>They segregated by sections,</p>
<p>people wanted to advertise against it.</p>
<p>And having a fixed amount of real estate</p>
<p>really made that real estate precious.</p>
<p>And I think that that was really, really important.</p>
<p>Now think about what&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>When you go to that same paper online,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just use the New York Times,</p>
<p>effectively that container has become infinite.</p>
<p>And so now you&rsquo;ve completely taken away</p>
<p>the ability for anybody to actually assign real value.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no above the masthead</p>
<p>or above the fold concept as much as there used to be,</p>
<p>especially in infinite scrolling.</p>
<p>The point of all of this is,</p>
<p>this is why there&rsquo;s no value in coming back</p>
<p>and re-telling the truth.</p>
<p>You just go to the next clickbait title</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re just keep on going and going</p>
<p>and you just wonder, hey, wait a minute,</p>
<p>to tell the truth is an inconvenient artifact</p>
<p>of my business model today.</p>
<p>Whereas before telling the truth was really important.</p>
<p>It was an anchor which created more value</p>
<p>for you to sell ads.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s just, it just gets lost in a sea of things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s such an agenda.</p>
<p>So the point is the financial markets</p>
<p>in this interesting way is the only,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s one of the few places left</p>
<p>where you can vote in real time about the truth, right?</p>
<p>And so for example, like, you know,</p>
<p>you get all of these readings</p>
<p>and you get all of these documents from the Fed,</p>
<p>which is the financial markets version of the CDC,</p>
<p>but you can vote that you don&rsquo;t believe them.</p>
<p>And you can see it every day,</p>
<p>the gap between what they say is narrative</p>
<p>and what the facts are.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a really healthy dynamic</p>
<p>that still exists in finance and capital markets.</p>
<p>We just need to figure out a way</p>
<p>where it exists everywhere else.</p>
<p>Otherwise, people will always want to make sure</p>
<p>that they have a direct conduit</p>
<p>to tell their version of the truth</p>
<p>and allow people to decide for themselves.</p>
<p>Before we get to science with Friedberg,</p>
<p>if he gets his camera back up and running,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys know,</p>
<p>but Vox canceled us this week</p>
<p>with an assist from Taylor Lorenz.</p>
<p>The funniest story in all of this</p>
<p>is the multimillionaire VC is co-opting</p>
<p>the language of young women,</p>
<p>MLM marketers in an effort to seem cool and hip with us.</p>
<p>Why white men are using the term besties.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you saw that.</p>
<p>I think Taylor Lorenz has had</p>
<p>her sense of humor surgically removed.</p>
<p>I mean, doesn&rsquo;t she understand</p>
<p>that this is a self-deprecating,</p>
<p>self-mocking bit that we came up with</p>
<p>or that you came up with?</p>
<p>I mean, come on, it&rsquo;s a gag.</p>
<p>We know it&rsquo;s funny for 50 year old guys</p>
<p>to be calling each other besties.</p>
<p>The reason why, by the way,</p>
<p>just if everybody wants to know</p>
<p>the origin of that is</p>
<p>one of our other friends, Phil Hellmuth,</p>
<p>kept calling me bestie C.</p>
<p>And we used to think it was the dumbest thing</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>And then what we thought would be even funnier</p>
<p>is to just co-opt it.</p>
<p>And it was done mostly-</p>
<p>And give him no credit.</p>
<p>But it was done initially to make fun</p>
<p>of how Muth used to call me.</p>
<p>Well, Phil, Hellmuth actually has</p>
<p>the maturity level of a teenage girl.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>With the name dropping.</p>
<p>When he used the term bestie,</p>
<p>he was not using it ironically.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re using it ironically.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about science</p>
<p>so we can keep the Friedberg ratio up</p>
<p>for all these Friedberg stands,</p>
<p>including whichever maniac</p>
<p>is running Friedberg&rsquo;s dogs,</p>
<p>anonymous Twitter handle.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you talked to Twitter security</p>
<p>about that yet, Friedberg.</p>
<p>My dog&rsquo;s on a walk right now.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll come back</p>
<p>and then he can tweet later as well.</p>
<p>It is my dog that runs the account.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So much for our ratings.</p>
<p>No tweet.</p>
<p>What is your dog&rsquo;s name again?</p>
<p>Monty.</p>
<p>Monty. Montgomery Wiggins.</p>
<p>With no Montgomery,</p>
<p>this is going to be lowest episode</p>
<p>in a long time.</p>
<p>His name was Wiggins at the SPCA</p>
<p>where I adopted him from.</p>
<p>And I wanted to name him Monty</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s like a hustler.</p>
<p>He hustled his way, you know,</p>
<p>from the streets of the mission</p>
<p>into a nice condo in Pack Heights.</p>
<p>So I gave him the full name Montgomery.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s Montgomery Wiggins now.</p>
<p>Oh, here he is.</p>
<p>Monty, come here.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Up.</p>
<p>Come here.</p>
<p>Come here.</p>
<p>Up.</p>
<p>Come on, D.</p>
<p>Come on, Monty.</p>
<p>OK, tweet something.</p>
<p>Hey, there&rsquo;s a lot going on</p>
<p>with synthetic biology.</p>
<p>We saw two different IPOs</p>
<p>in, I believe, the last month or so.</p>
<p>Tell us about the Ginko Bioworks</p>
<p>public offering</p>
<p>and the Zemmergen IPO.</p>
<p>Zemmergen.</p>
<p>So the premise of synthetic biology,</p>
<p>which dates back, you know,</p>
<p>many years, right?</p>
<p>Genentech is one of the first companies</p>
<p>to effectively use synthetic biology</p>
<p>to make products.</p>
<p>So, you know, Genentech and Amgen</p>
<p>started making these proteins</p>
<p>that became biologic drugs.</p>
<p>And the way you can kind of think</p>
<p>about synthetic biology</p>
<p>is the DNA is software</p>
<p>and we can program the software</p>
<p>to get the organism of the,</p>
<p>you know, whatever DNA we&rsquo;re changing</p>
<p>to make something that we want to use.</p>
<p>And so synthetic biology</p>
<p>is all about editing the genome</p>
<p>or editing the DNA of an organism,</p>
<p>editing its DNA</p>
<p>and doing that in a way</p>
<p>that you can kind of make a product.</p>
<p>And so this was done initially</p>
<p>for biologic drugs.</p>
<p>And over the last kind of 20 years or so,</p>
<p>using synthetic biology</p>
<p>as a kind of approach,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve kind of thought about,</p>
<p>well, how can we make things like fuel</p>
<p>and increasingly more commoditized products</p>
<p>like, you know, proteins</p>
<p>that we might consume</p>
<p>for animal consumption</p>
<p>instead of using animals to make proteins.</p>
<p>And so the underlying technologies</p>
<p>have all followed an accelerated path</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s greater than Moore&rsquo;s law.</p>
<p>You know, DNA sequencing costs</p>
<p>have dropped faster than Moore&rsquo;s law</p>
<p>over the last 10 or 15 years.</p>
<p>The ability to synthesize or print DNA,</p>
<p>CRISPR, you know, kind of provides us</p>
<p>with a set of tools</p>
<p>to do much more precise DNA editing</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just a confluence</p>
<p>of technologies,</p>
<p>sort of like there were leading up</p>
<p>to the personal computing revolution,</p>
<p>that are now going to enable</p>
<p>this incredible proliferation</p>
<p>of a new industry</p>
<p>that many argue will rewrite</p>
<p>all industrial systems,</p>
<p>all industry that makes everything</p>
<p>that humans consume from materials</p>
<p>to food, to the chemicals,</p>
<p>to the plastics,</p>
<p>everything that we use in our daily life</p>
<p>can be rewritten using synthetic biology.</p>
<p>And so the promise of this dates back</p>
<p>again, like two decades or so,</p>
<p>there was a company called Amaris</p>
<p>that John Doerr backed,</p>
<p>that was one of the first companies</p>
<p>that was one of the few companies</p>
<p>from the original synthetic biology companies</p>
<p>that actually survived and made it through.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re still around,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still a publicly traded company.</p>
<p>And more recently,</p>
<p>there have been these kind of</p>
<p>more digitally enabled,</p>
<p>at least that&rsquo;s the premise</p>
<p>that they kind of make</p>
<p>for what for their businesses, companies.</p>
<p>So Zymergen, which was, you know,</p>
<p>got a bunch of SoftBank money,</p>
<p>they raised a billion dollars</p>
<p>as a private company.</p>
<p>They got public with like,</p>
<p>I think 13 or 14 million of revenue.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re worth $5 billion</p>
<p>in their IPO.</p>
<p>So they just went public.</p>
<p>And this other company</p>
<p>called Ginkgo Bioworks,</p>
<p>which is a similar sort of,</p>
<p>you know, synthetic biology</p>
<p>platform company just went public,</p>
<p>or just announced that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going public via SPAC</p>
<p>at a $15 billion market cap</p>
<p>with, you know,</p>
<p>I think less than 100 million revenue.</p>
<p>So, you know, the game is on.</p>
<p>And I think one way</p>
<p>to kind of think about this is,</p>
<p>these businesses aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>great businesses today.</p>
<p>But the promise of the next century</p>
<p>being all about synthetic biology,</p>
<p>you know, where biology becomes software,</p>
<p>and you can program</p>
<p>biological organisms to make</p>
<p>and print pretty much anything</p>
<p>we as humans consume,</p>
<p>is a premise that everyone believes</p>
<p>is going to come to fruition this century.</p>
<p>And it will completely reinvent industry</p>
<p>will improve sustainability.</p>
<p>I think it is going to be</p>
<p>the great savior for this planet,</p>
<p>and for our ability</p>
<p>to sustain on this planet.</p>
<p>So these are kind of, you know,</p>
<p>two big IPOs that validate</p>
<p>that the capital markets are there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many big</p>
<p>institutional investors,</p>
<p>Chamath can share more on this</p>
<p>that are like backing,</p>
<p>quote, unquote, ESG companies.</p>
<p>Synthetic biology is this kind of ESG,</p>
<p>you know, moment.</p>
<p>And, and these two IPOs</p>
<p>happening at the valuations</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re happening at</p>
<p>and the capital that&rsquo;s going in.</p>
<p>I think these are kind of like</p>
<p>the Netscape moments</p>
<p>for synthetic biology.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to see</p>
<p>a tremendous amount happen</p>
<p>over the next couple of years.</p>
<p>So Chamath, how close are these</p>
<p>from being science projects in a lab</p>
<p>to being scalable revenue</p>
<p>companies in your estimation?</p>
<p>Because these are de minimis</p>
<p>amounts of capital we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>So this feels like</p>
<p>de minimis amounts of revenue.</p>
<p>De minimis amounts of revenue.</p>
<p>Large amounts of capital.</p>
<p>Large amounts of capital.</p>
<p>Is this, is this,</p>
<p>how far is it to actually</p>
<p>cross that chasm?</p>
<p>We, I think that we&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>trying to figure out</p>
<p>what the right business model</p>
<p>for these companies is.</p>
<p>So for example, like</p>
<p>if you look at chip design, right?</p>
<p>Like, so there&rsquo;s an entire value chain</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s the people</p>
<p>that manufacture the equipment, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the people that run the factory.</p>
<p>There are the people</p>
<p>that develop the tool chain.</p>
<p>So the software that you can use</p>
<p>to characterize and build a chip, right?</p>
<p>And if you look at those industries,</p>
<p>the factory in the middle</p>
<p>tends to be the least valuable.</p>
<p>Companies like Verilog,</p>
<p>you know, folks that make the software</p>
<p>are really important.</p>
<p>And then folks that make the equipment,</p>
<p>because the equipment is so precise</p>
<p>and very complicated is valuable.</p>
<p>If you translate that to biology,</p>
<p>we need to sort out</p>
<p>where the value is going to be.</p>
<p>So the amazing thing about Ginkgo</p>
<p>is what its promises,</p>
<p>what the promise that they</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to make to the market</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re going to make</p>
<p>biology programmable</p>
<p>so that an entire generation</p>
<p>of biologists and chemists</p>
<p>who would otherwise</p>
<p>have not been able to</p>
<p>just actually literally like</p>
<p>write into a command line interface</p>
<p>and generate biologic samples,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to be able to enable that</p>
<p>the same way an electrical engineer.</p>
<p>So like, you know, for example, like,</p>
<p>you know, when I was doing internships,</p>
<p>or you would literally be writing Verilog,</p>
<p>and it would get, you know,</p>
<p>basically generating</p>
<p>what was called a netlist,</p>
<p>and you could send a netlist to a fab,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden outcomes a chip.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>The problem that they have to figure out now</p>
<p>is, are you a tool provider?</p>
<p>Are you, you know, picking shovels?</p>
<p>Are you doing it yourself</p>
<p>on balance sheet?</p>
<p>Are you a product company?</p>
<p>And this is where we&rsquo;re too early</p>
<p>to know what the answer is.</p>
<p>But as the market sorts that out,</p>
<p>as David said,</p>
<p>more people will get comfortable</p>
<p>applying money.</p>
<p>This is why Zymergen and Ginkgo</p>
<p>are two really important data points,</p>
<p>because as David said,</p>
<p>it will force the market</p>
<p>to help these companies rationalize</p>
<p>where they are</p>
<p>and what the tool chain looks like</p>
<p>and compare it to semiconductors.</p>
<p>And in that you&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>an entire generation of companies get built.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super exciting.</p>
<p>I spent time in and around these businesses</p>
<p>without getting too specific.</p>
<p>And I think they&rsquo;re really compelling,</p>
<p>really interesting.</p>
<p>And this is I mean, I never I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>generally speak my book.</p>
<p>But this is where I spend most of my time,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So I really am making a bet on my career</p>
<p>and my capital and my time</p>
<p>on synthetic biology</p>
<p>and the opportunity it presents</p>
<p>for our species this century.</p>
<p>So all of the work I do</p>
<p>and I have several businesses</p>
<p>that I would say compete</p>
<p>with Ginkgo and Zymergen in different ways</p>
<p>and are attacking this problem</p>
<p>in different ways,</p>
<p>which is I mentioned this last time,</p>
<p>but how do you produce enough</p>
<p>biological material?</p>
<p>How do you make stuff?</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve got fermenters and you know,</p>
<p>so are there fermenter tank companies?</p>
<p>Are there, you know,</p>
<p>cheap fermentation platform companies?</p>
<p>You know, do we need to scale</p>
<p>these things up?</p>
<p>Do we need to kind of reinvent</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;re operating?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of stuff we need</p>
<p>to kind of figure out over</p>
<p>the next couple of years</p>
<p>for this to really kind of</p>
<p>sweep the world.</p>
<p>But the fact that we can like</p>
<p>program biology to make stuff for us</p>
<p>is kind of where we&rsquo;re at today.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the moment.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s another example</p>
<p>of a fabulous company.</p>
<p>This is a private company,</p>
<p>but you know, you&rsquo;ll see them</p>
<p>in the next probably three or four years</p>
<p>debut as a public business</p>
<p>called Pivot Bio,</p>
<p>another synthetic biology company,</p>
<p>which I think is just masterful.</p>
<p>And you know,</p>
<p>what essentially Pivot Bio does,</p>
<p>it essentially is a clean alternative</p>
<p>to synthetic nitrogen fertilizer.</p>
<p>So like you put this shit in the ground,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re planting seeds,</p>
<p>and what it enables is plants</p>
<p>that were previously</p>
<p>incapable of nitrogen fixation,</p>
<p>meaning getting nitrogen</p>
<p>out of the soil.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re able to do it.</p>
<p>Now, all of a sudden,</p>
<p>yields go up,</p>
<p>density goes up,</p>
<p>predictability of the crops go up.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a huge advance for farming.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting about,</p>
<p>you know, so Pivot Bio,</p>
<p>like Chamath mentioned,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of plants</p>
<p>like soybeans, legumes</p>
<p>that will fix nitrogen.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll take nitrogen out of the air,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>70% of the air is nitrogen.</p>
<p>And so plants need nitrogen to grow.</p>
<p>All protein has to have nitrogen in it.</p>
<p>So nitrogen is key to growing plants.</p>
<p>Corn, you need to put nitrogen</p>
<p>on the ground.</p>
<p>So around 6% of global electricity</p>
<p>is used to make ammonia,</p>
<p>which is the fertilizer</p>
<p>that farmers around the world</p>
<p>put on their fields</p>
<p>to grow their corn.</p>
<p>And the ammonia that sits on the field</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t get absorbed by the plant</p>
<p>turns into nitrous oxide,</p>
<p>which is a 300x worse greenhouse gas</p>
<p>than carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Think about that.</p>
<p>300 times the heat capacity</p>
<p>of carbon dioxide</p>
<p>when it goes up into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>So the environmental effects</p>
<p>of nitrogen-based agriculture are awful.</p>
<p>And, you know, Pivot is one of the first,</p>
<p>they actually commercialized</p>
<p>a research microbial strain to do this.</p>
<p>And you put it on the seed</p>
<p>before you put it in the ground.</p>
<p>But now the ability for us</p>
<p>to engineer microbes,</p>
<p>and the microbes now pull the nitrogen</p>
<p>out of the air</p>
<p>and stick it into the plant.</p>
<p>The ability for us to engineer microbes</p>
<p>opens up this universe of possibility</p>
<p>where Pivot is kind of like,</p>
<p>you know, kindergarten level</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>over the next couple of years,</p>
<p>where we can now engineer</p>
<p>all these microbes</p>
<p>to pull nitrogen out of the atmosphere</p>
<p>and maybe reduce all fertilizer use</p>
<p>and have a huge effect on greenhouse gas</p>
<p>resulting from agriculture.</p>
<p>A lot of what you&rsquo;ve mentioned</p>
<p>seems to be things in the world,</p>
<p>products that can be improved and refined.</p>
<p>What about inside of our bodies?</p>
<p>I know there are some efforts</p>
<p>to understand what cells are doing</p>
<p>and maybe use synthetic biology</p>
<p>to get a reading on a molecular</p>
<p>or cellular level</p>
<p>as to what is going on inside your body.</p>
<p>And then there are these</p>
<p>self replicating systems</p>
<p>that might be able to,</p>
<p>you know, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if your white blood cells were low,</p>
<p>you know, and it was the 80s</p>
<p>and it was HIV,</p>
<p>you could just boom,</p>
<p>produce more white sub blood cells</p>
<p>with a shot or something.</p>
<p>Well, the original idea of Moderna,</p>
<p>which we all know now</p>
<p>as being kind of this RNA vaccine producer</p>
<p>was you could put RNA in your body</p>
<p>and therefore provide the code</p>
<p>to get yourselves to make specific proteins</p>
<p>that can do things in your body.</p>
<p>And so we did this example.</p>
<p>Well, the example we&rsquo;re using now</p>
<p>is the COVID vaccine, right?</p>
<p>So it makes the COVID the spike protein,</p>
<p>which we then develop</p>
<p>an immune response to.</p>
<p>But the idea with Moderna</p>
<p>is you could eventually replace medicine</p>
<p>with these RNA shots.</p>
<p>And now yourselves can start</p>
<p>to make specific proteins</p>
<p>to do specific things in your body.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;re very elementary as a species</p>
<p>in our understanding of how proteins</p>
<p>drive systems level biology and outcomes.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re starting to learn about this.</p>
<p>But I will tell you,</p>
<p>there is a really interesting research team</p>
<p>at UCSF led by a woman</p>
<p>named Hannah El-Sameed.</p>
<p>And this research team is identifying</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re building a toolkit of proteins,</p>
<p>where these proteins can almost have</p>
<p>like robotic arms,</p>
<p>they can have really interesting function.</p>
<p>Think about Martin Short in inner space.</p>
<p>Remember that machine he went in,</p>
<p>he went in the body,</p>
<p>and he started doing stuff in the body.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re working on building</p>
<p>basically a toolkit.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just a single protein</p>
<p>that now it goes and does something,</p>
<p>but really complicated combinations</p>
<p>of proteins that can now go in the body</p>
<p>and fix things and repair things</p>
<p>and react environmentally</p>
<p>to specific conditions in the body,</p>
<p>like, oh, there&rsquo;s a cancer cell here,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go do something to it now.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this whole,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this whole world of like dynamic,</p>
<p>called, you know,</p>
<p>kind of making things more dynamical</p>
<p>than they have been historically.</p>
<p>Just just thinking about aging,</p>
<p>would it theoretically be able to help</p>
<p>with hearing loss, eyesight loss,</p>
<p>you know, and those type of things?</p>
<p>Would you be able to</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another area of biology,</p>
<p>we could talk about this at length,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s another biology called</p>
<p>stem cell therapy,</p>
<p>where you can basically take,</p>
<p>you know, all cells evolve</p>
<p>from stem cells in your body.</p>
<p>So these are kind of the original cells</p>
<p>that you have initially in an embryo, right?</p>
<p>And then as your body kind of grows,</p>
<p>you end up with these stem cells,</p>
<p>and you have stem cells in your body today.</p>
<p>Those stem cells, when they make a copy,</p>
<p>they could differentiate</p>
<p>into different cells in your body.</p>
<p>So for the last, you know, 10, 20 years</p>
<p>in California, by the way,</p>
<p>has about a $4 billion,</p>
<p>if I remember right stem cell grant program,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re funding research</p>
<p>into stem cell therapies.</p>
<p>So there are significantly successful</p>
<p>therapies right now,</p>
<p>multiple companies are productizing</p>
<p>and launching and they&rsquo;re already active</p>
<p>in the market for fixing blindness</p>
<p>with people that have specific diseases</p>
<p>called retinitis pigmentosa,</p>
<p>where your your the retinal cells</p>
<p>in your body and your eyes</p>
<p>degrade and stop working,</p>
<p>you will get a stem cell injection</p>
<p>of progenitor retinal stem cells</p>
<p>into your eye,</p>
<p>and you will grow a new retina</p>
<p>and you can see again.</p>
<p>And the efficacy is insane.</p>
<p>It is incredible how well this works.</p>
<p>And they are doing this with lots</p>
<p>of other stem cell therapies.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re getting so smart.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s an incredible thing</p>
<p>scientists discovered a few years ago,</p>
<p>and I think these guys won</p>
<p>the Nobel Prize for this,</p>
<p>you could take any cell</p>
<p>in the human body</p>
<p>and induce it chemically,</p>
<p>meaning you put a bunch</p>
<p>of chemicals on that cell</p>
<p>and get that cell to convert</p>
<p>back into a stem cell.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ve created your own stem cells</p>
<p>from your own body.</p>
<p>And you can now put them</p>
<p>back in your body and get them</p>
<p>to turn into any other cell</p>
<p>in your body.</p>
<p>So this is called induced</p>
<p>pluripotent stem cell therapy,</p>
<p>IPSC.</p>
<p>So IPSC now forms the basis</p>
<p>for a lot of these stem cell therapy</p>
<p>kind of programs</p>
<p>that are underway.</p>
<p>And so this is going to be</p>
<p>an insane field</p>
<p>over the next couple of decades.</p>
<p>Friedberg,</p>
<p>if we took the $25 billion</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t need in California</p>
<p>and gave it to these companies,</p>
<p>how quickly could we survive?</p>
<p>How quickly could we solve this problem?</p>
<p>Nothing drives me more nuts</p>
<p>than when I see money</p>
<p>not going to science.</p>
<p>I mean, it is just nuts.</p>
<p>Seriously, like let&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>we need to start</p>
<p>our own political party</p>
<p>that is based on reasonable suggestions</p>
<p>like the one I just made</p>
<p>or the ones, you know,</p>
<p>the middle ground party,</p>
<p>just a reasonable party.</p>
<p>Tax, do you think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s possibility for a third</p>
<p>for a true third party</p>
<p>in the United States?</p>
<p>Structurally, no,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really set up</p>
<p>to be a two party system.</p>
<p>You have to really take over</p>
<p>one of the two parties.</p>
<p>And frankly, the problem</p>
<p>in our politics right now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>the Republican Party is great,</p>
<p>but the Democrat Party</p>
<p>has basically been taken over</p>
<p>by woke socialists.</p>
<p>So, you know, but</p>
<p>so I think that kind of</p>
<p>like limits your options.</p>
<p>But I mean,</p>
<p>what you have to do</p>
<p>is create a movement</p>
<p>and then you basically</p>
<p>take over one of the parties.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, what we&rsquo;re describing today,</p>
<p>I mean, just to up level it is,</p>
<p>it almost feels like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in a race</p>
<p>between technological acceleration</p>
<p>and social and political deterioration.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So like technology.</p>
<p>One more time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a race,</p>
<p>I think, for the future</p>
<p>between technological acceleration</p>
<p>and social and political deterioration.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And the question is,</p>
<p>which one of these forces</p>
<p>is going to win the future?</p>
<p>Everything Friberg describes</p>
<p>is incredibly hopeful, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to be able to cure people</p>
<p>with all these miracle technologies.</p>
<p>I mean, even the new mRNA vaccines</p>
<p>that were developed for COVID.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s miraculous, right?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to be able</p>
<p>to use that same mRNA technology</p>
<p>for other things, other diseases,</p>
<p>maybe even to attack cancer cells.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>positive things happening</p>
<p>and we all see it</p>
<p>in the technology ecosystem.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been an explosion</p>
<p>of wealth creation and opportunity</p>
<p>created over the last 20 years</p>
<p>in technology.</p>
<p>And so we have this</p>
<p>very positive force.</p>
<p>And then everything</p>
<p>that seems to be happening</p>
<p>in our politics and society</p>
<p>is negative.</p>
<p>It involves deterioration.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>special interest corruption.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically people</p>
<p>wedded to these insane ideologies.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Like what we really want</p>
<p>is just a pragmatic party</p>
<p>that allows the private sector</p>
<p>to do its job,</p>
<p>generate the wealth necessary</p>
<p>to then fund social programs</p>
<p>instead of trying to upturn</p>
<p>the whole system,</p>
<p>which is what it feels</p>
<p>like so many people in power</p>
<p>are trying to do today.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I registered Reason Party for us</p>
<p>if we ever want to go there.</p>
<p>So if you want to bookmark Reason Party.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about this tonight, boys,</p>
<p>because I got to run.</p>
<p>Is it on?</p>
<p>Yum, yum.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to see two of you tonight.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I cannot wait.</p>
<p>Sax, you got to fly up.</p>
<p>You got to fly up.</p>
<p>Sax, what&rsquo;s the point of having a bird</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t let the bird out of the cage?</p>
<p>Our friend from L.A. is flying up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, you can fly up.</p>
<p>Our other friend who puts the ball</p>
<p>in the basket is coming.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There are many friends.</p>
<p>As many friends.</p>
<p>Come on, Sax.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Basketball friends.</p>
<p>Free the bird.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take it under advisement.</p>
<p>Speaking of bird,</p>
<p>they just announced a SPAC today.</p>
<p>Oh, here comes the plane.</p>
<p>Oh, here we go.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>You ain&rsquo;t got no fuckings.</p>
<p>I got to go.</p>
<p>I got to go.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to give a shout out to bird on SPAC.</p>
<p>I love you, besties,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll see you next time.</p>
<p>See you guys.</p>
<p>On the All In podcast.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>The queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>What your winners like.</p>
<p>What your winners like.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my dog taking a notice</p>
<p>in your driveway, Sax.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>My avatars will meet me at Plymouth.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room</p>
<p>and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension</p>
<p>that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re the bee.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re the bee.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a bee.</p>
