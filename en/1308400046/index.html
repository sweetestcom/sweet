    <p>Hi friends, this week we&rsquo;re talking about how to handle someone not liking you back.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m giggling bitch, cause this is a serious topic, like this is like</p>
<p>very hurts your heart, like this shit will fuck you up.</p>
<p>But I have a lot to break down with this, because you can get stuck in playing the game.</p>
<p>Because there is a big game that comes with when someone doesn&rsquo;t like you back, so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna break all that shit down.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m also gonna teach you how to navigate this and how to like not have it fucking ruin</p>
<p>you and feel useless and worthless.</p>
<p>And even if you&rsquo;re like, oh no, like Leo, I&rsquo;m not going through this, everybody like</p>
<p>me back.</p>
<p>Maybe your friend&rsquo;s going through it, so watch this fucking episode regardless.</p>
<p>And if you know someone that would benefit from this episode, make sure to send it to</p>
<p>them, okay?</p>
<p>Cause this is all the things I&rsquo;ve learned about how to not let people not liking me</p>
<p>hurt my heart.</p>
<p>Cause like that shit used to ruin me, dude.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;re gonna get into what would Leo do.</p>
<p>WWLD, that&rsquo;s where you guys write in and I give you advice on your situations.</p>
<p>I feel like my mic is a little too far from my motherfucking face.</p>
<p>Okay perfect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m flailing about with my arms.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to like hit it.</p>
<p>Cause this bitch is expensive.</p>
<p>So first things first, if you&rsquo;re in a situation right now where someone doesn&rsquo;t like you back</p>
<p>or doesn&rsquo;t want to date you or whatever it is, but you want to date them or you like</p>
<p>them, whether it&rsquo;s like a friendship or it&rsquo;s like a relationship type thing, all this applies</p>
<p>to both, but this is mainly going to be geared to a relationship.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s totally normal to feel disappointed, like you&rsquo;re going to be sad as shit and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to hurt like a bitch.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s like a minor form of rejection.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like it is, it&rsquo;s full on rejection.</p>
<p>But if you like someone, that means you see value in them.</p>
<p>You appreciate them and you want them.</p>
<p>You could like see how you would benefit from being around them or being with them.</p>
<p>And if this person that you see value in does not have the same feelings towards you, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to make you question your value.</p>
<p>So let me nix that shit for you real fast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to teach you how to not let it like make you turn the knife at yourself and starting</p>
<p>to nitpick what&rsquo;s wrong with you, why you&rsquo;re not good enough, X, Y, Z.</p>
<p>So if someone doesn&rsquo;t like you back or they don&rsquo;t want you in their life, they might see</p>
<p>value in you and they might be able to recognize it, but they&rsquo;re not recognizing it to the</p>
<p>extent of where they would want you to be with them.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re fully blind to what you have to offer.</p>
<p>They might just not want it, which is okay.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to get into that.</p>
<p>So really there&rsquo;s two options when you like someone and they don&rsquo;t like you back.</p>
<p>For the other person, they either see the value in you or they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t see the value in you, sorry bitch, not really much you can do about that.</p>
<p>But if they do see the value in you, there&rsquo;s a couple of different ways that can go.</p>
<p>So they can see the value in you and understand that you&rsquo;re not what they prefer and not want</p>
<p>to be with you.</p>
<p>Or they can see the value in you and be intimidated by it and not feel good enough for it and</p>
<p>push you away and pretend like they don&rsquo;t want you.</p>
<p>But when someone doesn&rsquo;t like you back, your immediate thought is like they just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want you.</p>
<p>But sometimes there&rsquo;s a lot more that plays into it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to give you an example of a psychiatrist that I went on a date with.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>We all know Leo is very well versed in the field of psychology, bitch.</p>
<p>And there was this psychiatrist that I was interested in and I liked like a couple of</p>
<p>years ago when I was going through it, bitch.</p>
<p>But we went on a date and I could see by looking at him, like I was the cuter one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to just fucking say that.</p>
<p>But he was older, he was more successful, he had more shit going for him like financially</p>
<p>at the time than I did.</p>
<p>But I liked him.</p>
<p>Like I didn&rsquo;t really like him that much, but I kind of liked him.</p>
<p>And as we hung out and we got to know each other, like I&rsquo;m a very intense personality.</p>
<p>One.</p>
<p>Two, the way I care for people and the way that people feel comfortable around me is</p>
<p>not something that most people experience.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m a lot to take in, in the good way, but also there&rsquo;s some bad things too.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not just going to go over here and toot my own horn, like I&rsquo;m going to let you know</p>
<p>like I have shit rolling on me too.</p>
<p>But I thought the date went good.</p>
<p>And I was like, okay, this dude is going to be fucking obsessed with me.</p>
<p>Like after our little date, after he got to know me more, I&rsquo;m like he&rsquo;s going to be obsessed</p>
<p>with me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to want me.</p>
<p>But like at dinner, I was kind of like talking laps around him in psychology shit.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s what he does for a living and I was better at it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s very intimidating.</p>
<p>And also to meet someone that is almost half your age and they&rsquo;re smarter than you mentally.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very fucking intimidating.</p>
<p>But I wasn&rsquo;t looking at that at the time.</p>
<p>I was just looking at it like, okay, I like this motherfucker.</p>
<p>I see all the things I have to contribute.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to be obsessed with me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to want me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to love me.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>He kind of like pushed me away and like acted like I wasn&rsquo;t worth a shit is how I took it.</p>
<p>Like he wasn&rsquo;t trying to hang out.</p>
<p>Like I was initiated hanging out and he like wasn&rsquo;t wanting to hang out.</p>
<p>And he kind of like ghosted after a minute.</p>
<p>And when people ghost me, I let them.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to ignore me, I&rsquo;m never reaching out to you again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;ve always fucking been.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just how things are going to go.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You can hit my ego once, but you&rsquo;re not hitting it twice, bitch.</p>
<p>But this whole situation fucked me up because I was like, what the fuck?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m everything you could fucking want.</p>
<p>Like to find someone like me in the gay community.</p>
<p>Good fucking luck, bitch.</p>
<p>I was just so confused.</p>
<p>Like how could you not want me?</p>
<p>Like look at you and look at me.</p>
<p>Someone like me is showing interest in you, bitch.</p>
<p>You should be jumping at the fucking chance to be with me.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to like have a big head.</p>
<p>Like if he was cuter than me, I would not be saying this, but he was uglier than me.</p>
<p>And like, I was a match.</p>
<p>Like we were like a match kind of, but I still was cuter.</p>
<p>And I had a better personality, but that whole situation made me second guess and question</p>
<p>everything about myself.</p>
<p>Multiple situations did, but that one in specific is what made me realize so much shit.</p>
<p>I was like, okay, he clearly sees my fucking value.</p>
<p>How can you not bitch?</p>
<p>Because like in the gay community, I&rsquo;m a rare motherfucker to find.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like any other gay.</p>
<p>So someone that is in the gay community and experiences all of these gays, when they experience</p>
<p>the contrast of me, it&rsquo;s obvious it&rsquo;s in front of their fucking face.</p>
<p>But a lot of people don&rsquo;t know what to do with that.</p>
<p>And I just couldn&rsquo;t fathom why he didn&rsquo;t want me and why he wouldn&rsquo;t like appreciate me</p>
<p>and try to go for me.</p>
<p>But upon further reflection, I looked at everything that I had to offer and everything about myself</p>
<p>and then him, like he didn&rsquo;t know what the fuck to do with someone like me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s only ever been used to like typical normal gays.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not used to someone like me who thinks like me, acts like me, looks like me, none</p>
<p>of it.</p>
<p>So one, he was intimidated that I was better at psychology than him.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what he does for a living.</p>
<p>And two, looks, he was probably insecure and like worried about it.</p>
<p>Three, people that are older and go after people younger like to feel like they have</p>
<p>the upper hand.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the dynamics with like sugar daddies and like I should do a whole episode</p>
<p>on sugar daddies and sugar mamas and how to like protect yourself mentally if you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to like sugar baby.</p>
<p>So these older people like to feel like they can contribute a lot.</p>
<p>And what he was faced with meeting me was someone he couldn&rsquo;t contribute to.</p>
<p>So he didn&rsquo;t feel safe to like me or care about me because he probably was already intimidated</p>
<p>and then was thinking, I don&rsquo;t feel like I have anything to contribute.</p>
<p>So he had no like sense of safety with how he&rsquo;s used to like feeling good about himself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is too far like for like how I&rsquo;m explaining it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m explaining it right.</p>
<p>But at the beginning, I tried to attack myself and I was like, what the fuck is wrong that</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t like me?</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t find anything because my whole life I&rsquo;ve dealt with not being accepted, being</p>
<p>rejected, people not wanting me, people not choosing me, like I&rsquo;ve perfected and corrected</p>
<p>everything about myself physically, mentally, emotionally, personality wise, like anything</p>
<p>you could fix, I&rsquo;ve fucking fixed it.</p>
<p>And I was finally at a point where I&rsquo;m like, okay, my value is obvious to me.</p>
<p>So this motherfucker either don&rsquo;t see it, which means you don&rsquo;t have it.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re right and you the fuck off, or you do see it and it&rsquo;s not what you prefer, which</p>
<p>is fine.</p>
<p>Or you see it and you&rsquo;re intimidated by it.</p>
<p>So when someone doesn&rsquo;t like you back, you typically don&rsquo;t get an explanation of why</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t like you.</p>
<p>So your brain&rsquo;s going to kind of try and fill in the fucking gaps.</p>
<p>And mine immediately went to making it about me and trying to figure out what the fuck</p>
<p>I was doing wrong.</p>
<p>And I realized I ain&rsquo;t really doing nothing wrong, nothing really left to fix.</p>
<p>And two years ago, I was finally at the place where I&rsquo;m like, even if you don&rsquo;t like certain</p>
<p>things, I&rsquo;m not willing to change them.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s who I am.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what I like about myself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the authentic me.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like it, eat shit.</p>
<p>But it fucked me up mentally for so long because I was like, how do you not want me?</p>
<p>Like it does not make sense.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>If it doesn&rsquo;t make sense, it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s not fucking meant to.</p>
<p>If it does not make sense that someone doesn&rsquo;t like you, it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re not looking</p>
<p>at it correctly.</p>
<p>As soon as I realized he&rsquo;s fucking intimidated, and there&rsquo;s a lot more that went into play</p>
<p>other than he just doesn&rsquo;t see my value, it made more sense.</p>
<p>But just to look at the comparison of like me and him, he should be jumping at me.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s so much shit that goes on in the middle that I don&rsquo;t know about.</p>
<p>You can think about it and you can wonder about it.</p>
<p>But if someone doesn&rsquo;t like you, and it doesn&rsquo;t make sense, there&rsquo;s more at play.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not to fucking do with you.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just gonna throw that the fuck out there.</p>
<p>But anytime someone sends you the message that I&rsquo;m okay living without you, that shit&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna fucking hurt.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not crazy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not weird.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not stupid.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not insecure.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re none of this.</p>
<p>Like this will hurt anyone.</p>
<p>But basically, if you like someone and they don&rsquo;t like you back, like they&rsquo;re basically</p>
<p>telling you, no, I&rsquo;m fine.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m okay.</p>
<p>Like I can live my life without you and I&rsquo;ll be just fine.</p>
<p>That is a hard feeling to take on for when someone looks at you like that.</p>
<p>Or even if they&rsquo;re like, okay, I don&rsquo;t want to date you, but I&rsquo;m down to be friends.</p>
<p>What the fuck?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s still gonna hurt too.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably gonna hurt worse.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s like, I see value in you, like you&rsquo;re cool, like, all right, but I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like you enough to bring you close to me or be intimate with you and like date you.</p>
<p>So all this shit&rsquo;s gonna have you feel in all kinds of ways.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not gonna be good.</p>
<p>But when I say this shit can become a game, I mean it can become a game.</p>
<p>Because what it basically can turn into is resetting your self-esteem.</p>
<p>So when someone doesn&rsquo;t like you, it kind of like you&rsquo;re gonna take a hit.</p>
<p>Like your self-esteem is gonna take a hit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be like, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re getting knocked off your rocker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if I punch you in the head, your equilibrium is gonna be a little off.</p>
<p>Same thing happens when someone doesn&rsquo;t like you.</p>
<p>Your sense of self is gonna be a little off.</p>
<p>You just took a hit to it.</p>
<p>So this person that just caused this hit to your self-esteem, this is gonna turn into</p>
<p>a chase and it&rsquo;s gonna make you think that you want this person and like this person</p>
<p>even more.</p>
<p>Because like I said, you already see the value in them.</p>
<p>But now they&rsquo;ve just rocked your fucking self-esteem.</p>
<p>And you know and your brain knows where that came from.</p>
<p>So to get this person&rsquo;s approval and to convince this person to like you is what you think</p>
<p>is gonna absolve your self-esteem and like repair it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s where it gets into a game.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna think that you want this person so much more.</p>
<p>What you really want is their validation that they do see your value.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about wanting them or not wanting them because a lot of times you&rsquo;ll get into</p>
<p>a situation where you like someone, they don&rsquo;t like you.</p>
<p>And then you get into this like push and pull of like convincing them to finally want you.</p>
<p>And then once they want you, a lot of times you&rsquo;re like, nah, I don&rsquo;t actually really</p>
<p>like you.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s a game.</p>
<p>Because a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize what you&rsquo;re seeking is their approval and their</p>
<p>validation and like reconstruction of your self-esteem.</p>
<p>Because if they&rsquo;re the one that broke it down, they can build it back up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like to convince someone of your value, it&rsquo;s gonna feel good.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t actually want them.</p>
<p>You want their validation that they see what they previously didn&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve been through so many situations like that where I&rsquo;m like, you didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>me?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m gonna make you want me, bitch.</p>
<p>And I would do everything in my power to like flip shit and become someone that they wanted</p>
<p>just so I could reject them.</p>
<p>Like just so I can like feel better.</p>
<p>But most of the times when it turned into that game of like, I want this person, I want</p>
<p>this thing, you just feel like you want this person so much, but you want their validation.</p>
<p>And once you get it, you&rsquo;re gonna have clarity and be like, I don&rsquo;t think I actually want</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not so hard for someone to actually recognize you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, bitch, now I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m bored.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m over you.</p>
<p>Like, fuck that.</p>
<p>Like you put in all this work, but as soon as they give you that validation and your</p>
<p>self esteem gets boosted back up, like, okay, I&rsquo;m not worthless.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be over them.</p>
<p>But I did want to give that explanation of why you feel so strongly for someone that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want you back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more at play than just I want them and they don&rsquo;t want me.</p>
<p>Basically you get the confirmation that they do see your value and they do want you.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;re after.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not after the person, you&rsquo;re after the feeling state of feeling more like solidified</p>
<p>and whole and valuable.</p>
<p>One more little tidbit I want to bring up is this weird dynamic that can happen.</p>
<p>If you do not see in yourself how you&rsquo;re valuable, if someone likes you, you&rsquo;re gonna be turned</p>
<p>off by it.</p>
<p>Like, we never like the ones that like us, right?</p>
<p>But I have a whole episode about why you don&rsquo;t like the ones that like you.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like episode two or some shit of my podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.</p>
<p>So for those of you that don&rsquo;t know, that have just joined me since YouTube, I have</p>
<p>like 38 or like 39 episodes that are audio only.</p>
<p>So you can go through and listen to those on Spotify or Apple Podcasts or wherever else</p>
<p>podcasts are.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fucking know where it&rsquo;s at, but I put it everywhere.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t see why someone could like you, when someone does like you, you might</p>
<p>be put off by it.</p>
<p>You might be like, what the fuck?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll think it&rsquo;s a joke.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll think there&rsquo;s like some kind of hidden agenda, some hidden intention of like, okay,</p>
<p>why the fuck would you like me?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re kind of like caution is going to come up of like, hang on.</p>
<p>I wanted to give a little explanation with that too, because if you don&rsquo;t see what someone</p>
<p>could possibly like about you, you&rsquo;re not going to trust when they said that they like</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s hit on preferences because everybody has preferences for the people that they like,</p>
<p>what they want, what they find attractive, what they value.</p>
<p>So everybody has different preferences and you&rsquo;re not going to be able to meet everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>preferences and like fit what everyone wants.</p>
<p>So you have to know that that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to be for everyone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure as fuck not like from a friend standpoint, from a podcast standpoint, there&rsquo;s people</p>
<p>that love my podcast and people that fucking hate it.</p>
<p>So even from a dating standpoint, I&rsquo;m not everybody&rsquo;s cup of tea.</p>
<p>Everybody has preferences and you&rsquo;re not going to meet them all, but that does not mean anything</p>
<p>is wrong with you because you do not match up to what someone prefers because people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>preferences are typically about needs.</p>
<p>So if they have certain needs, that&rsquo;s where their preferences kind of come from that they</p>
<p>see like what can meet my needs and what can&rsquo;t and a need can be what someone physically</p>
<p>needs, mentally needs, emotionally needs, what they like, what they don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>Those are needs too.</p>
<p>So everybody&rsquo;s their own little fucking mix like what&rsquo;s like something that&rsquo;s like messy</p>
<p>and like trail mix like that&rsquo;s fucking, that&rsquo;s gross.</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s like a bag of fucking tricks.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s their own bag of fucking tricks with what they like.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a jumbled fucking mess and you&rsquo;re not going to be able to like match everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>jumbled mess.</p>
<p>But just because you aren&rsquo;t what someone prefers, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that you have no value.</p>
<p>And I do want to say you have so much value to give.</p>
<p>You are capable of meeting needs for people.</p>
<p>You are someone&rsquo;s full list of preferences.</p>
<p>But what you&rsquo;re doing when you line up with someone that doesn&rsquo;t want you is you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to give what you have to give to someone that can&rsquo;t appreciate it or someone that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want it.</p>
<p>And like I&rsquo;ve said before, you can&rsquo;t make a motherfucker like you by giving them more</p>
<p>of what they already don&rsquo;t appreciate it.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t appreciate it, they&rsquo;re never going to see it.</p>
<p>They might one day they&rsquo;re going to get knocked upside the head with some awareness and then</p>
<p>they might be like, oh, look what was in front of me the whole time.</p>
<p>But you have to decide, are you willing to wait for that?</p>
<p>Are you willing to fight for this person to see you or do you want to go put your energy</p>
<p>and effort into finding someone who sees it off the bat and immediately prefers what you</p>
<p>are?</p>
<p>So you can also look at this like you&rsquo;re trying to meet needs for someone that doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the needs that you are able to meet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if I have a crush on a fucking straight dude, babe, it&rsquo;s not going to fucking work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not what he prefers and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with me.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m worthless and I have nothing to offer.</p>
<p>The motherfucker just has a different preference that I&rsquo;m not able to meet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fucking dude.</p>
<p>If he likes girls, there&rsquo;s nothing that I can do about that.</p>
<p>Like there are certain things out of your control, but there are certain things that</p>
<p>are in your control.</p>
<p>But if someone does not prefer what you cannot change, you have to accept it, like face it,</p>
<p>and then go find someone that does prefer what you are and what you have.</p>
<p>So one thing I do want to give you that&rsquo;s going to switch your entire perspective around</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>Okay, so the people that watch my podcast and like actually like it and you appreciate</p>
<p>me and what I post and what I do, like y&rsquo;all like me, y&rsquo;all get it, y&rsquo;all know me.</p>
<p>Imagine I came to you and I was like, hey, there&rsquo;s this person that I like that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like me.</p>
<p>And I got down on myself and I was like, I&rsquo;m worthless, like no one&rsquo;s going to want me.</p>
<p>And I was just going on about a fucking pity party of like how I&rsquo;m not good enough, how</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not worth shit because this one person doesn&rsquo;t like me.</p>
<p>You would literally look at me and be like, you stupid fuck.</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>You would just look at me and be so confused.</p>
<p>Like you would genuinely be baffled because you recognize my value.</p>
<p>You see what I have to offer and you see the person that I am and you see how great of</p>
<p>a partner I could be or a friend I could be.</p>
<p>So for me to be questioning my value because one person didn&rsquo;t like me, it would not make</p>
<p>sense to you because it&rsquo;s so obvious in front of your face.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re the person being rejected, it&rsquo;s hard to have that objective view.</p>
<p>So what I want you all to do is if you have someone that does not like you back, look</p>
<p>at me in that scenario, how you can see my value.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d say, I don&rsquo;t see how anybody wouldn&rsquo;t want to be with Leo.</p>
<p>What about me?</p>
<p>Do you see that you think I&rsquo;m so valuable?</p>
<p>What do you see in me?</p>
<p>What can you identify and what can you feel about me?</p>
<p>Literally make a fucking list if you have to, or just think about it.</p>
<p>Like think about what you recognize in me that you can see is so desirable.</p>
<p>And then I want you to switch it and look at yourself and see, is there anything in</p>
<p>me that I also see in Leo that makes him so valuable?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s going to bring you face to face with the value you actually have.</p>
<p>If you realize you have all the things that you see in me, there&rsquo;s no question if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>valuable or not.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to actually feel it and see it truly.</p>
<p>And you won&rsquo;t be able to question it because it&rsquo;s not in you.</p>
<p>Like I said, it&rsquo;s hard to go through it when it&rsquo;s just you.</p>
<p>But as soon as you can flip it, like I say, relationships are your biggest teachers.</p>
<p>Other people are your biggest teachers and your biggest reflections.</p>
<p>You just have to know how to tap into that knowledge and tap into that information.</p>
<p>So I just gave you the tip to do that.</p>
<p>But what you see in me, look for it in yourself because that&rsquo;s going to boost the fuck out</p>
<p>of your self-esteem.</p>
<p>Because also look at the person that like rejected me.</p>
<p>How would you look at the person who rejected me and didn&rsquo;t want me?</p>
<p>You would look at them like a fucking idiot.</p>
<p>Like they didn&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s in front of their face.</p>
<p>And you would not tell me it&rsquo;s my fault or something&rsquo;s wrong with me.</p>
<p>You just be like, oh, you would write them off and be like, they don&rsquo;t fucking see what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in front of them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a goddamn dumb ass.</p>
<p>They missed out.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t tell me I&rsquo;m worthless.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re out of it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my next point is attacking yourself when someone doesn&rsquo;t like you.</p>
<p>How you can look at me if I was rejected and you would just write the other person off</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re a goddamn dumb ass.</p>
<p>I want you to do the same for yourself.</p>
<p>Once you go on the scavenger hunt and start to see your own value, I want you to look</p>
<p>at, okay, if I see all this in myself and someone else didn&rsquo;t see it and appreciate</p>
<p>it, they&rsquo;re just fucking blind or they have needs that I don&rsquo;t meet, which is fine.</p>
<p>When it comes to attacking yourself when someone doesn&rsquo;t like you, it&rsquo;s a subconscious thing</p>
<p>because when you make yourself the problem, it gives you a sense of control because you</p>
<p>cannot control if someone likes you or not.</p>
<p>But instead of facing I&rsquo;m powerless to people seeing my own value, it feels better to turn</p>
<p>the knife at yourself and be like, I&rsquo;m too fat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m too skinny.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m black.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m white.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m whatever.</p>
<p>And you start trying to change those things.</p>
<p>It gives you a sense of control.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not powerless to people liking me or not.</p>
<p>I can do something to control that and guarantee people will like me.</p>
<p>I can change my appearance.</p>
<p>I can change my personality.</p>
<p>I can change everything about myself to become what someone prefers.</p>
<p>All that does is give you a sense of control.</p>
<p>But once you do this, you&rsquo;re going to be able to look at the situation and analyze it because</p>
<p>once you see your own value and you notice all the things you have to offer in yourself,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re immediately going to be like, okay, so now I see all these things.</p>
<p>This person does not want me.</p>
<p>So they aren&rsquo;t seeing what I now see or they don&rsquo;t have the needs that I can meet.</p>
<p>So they might be able to see it, but they don&rsquo;t want anything further from it, which</p>
<p>is fine.</p>
<p>But from that standpoint, when someone doesn&rsquo;t like you back, you&rsquo;re not immediately going</p>
<p>to be like frantic and freaking out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be a little disappointed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be a little upset, like damn, but you&rsquo;re going to be able to see your value</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>And if you have lined up with someone that has not liked you back or has reflected that</p>
<p>you have no value, what that&rsquo;s done is just lined you up with the experience that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to make you aware of what you have to value.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re watching this episode, you&rsquo;re not the same.</p>
<p>Even this far along, you&rsquo;re not the same.</p>
<p>And at the end of it, you&rsquo;re definitely not going to be the fucking same.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re not going to be able to ignore and deny your value anymore, regardless of</p>
<p>who does not like you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So my next tip for being okay when somebody don&rsquo;t like you back is I&rsquo;m going to send you</p>
<p>on a scavenger hunt to try and find your own value.</p>
<p>So what I want you to do is imagine you just met yourself for the first time.</p>
<p>Why would you be happy to finally have met someone like you?</p>
<p>Why would you feel relieved like, oh my God, finally, what about you?</p>
<p>Would you be happy to meet if you had an identical fucking clone?</p>
<p>Like what would you be excited about meeting this person for?</p>
<p>Like look at all the traits, look at all the things, look at every fucking detail, even</p>
<p>as small as you can think of.</p>
<p>The way that you talk, the way that you move, the way that you care for somebody, your mannerisms,</p>
<p>the way that you&rsquo;re thoughtful, the way that you are loyal and you will fight for the people</p>
<p>you care about, the way that you care about other people&rsquo;s feelings, literally anything,</p>
<p>your style, your looks, anything you can find about why you would be excited and also happy</p>
<p>to finally have met someone like you is going to boost the fuck out of your self esteem.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not worried about making your head big bitch.</p>
<p>I want to make you guys&rsquo;s head as big as possible because if you&rsquo;ve been a match to finding</p>
<p>this podcast, we&rsquo;re all insecure.</p>
<p>So I need to build you to like blow that fucking head up.</p>
<p>So here we are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give you the fucking air tank to blow your head up.</p>
<p>Do not be afraid of having a big head.</p>
<p>Do not be afraid of seeing your own value.</p>
<p>Being humble is fucking useless.</p>
<p>Like for you to not see your own value, what the fuck is that about?</p>
<p>To look like a good person, to be fucked on and be giving your value to someone who can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>appreciate it.</p>
<p>Fuck that.</p>
<p>Stop being humble.</p>
<p>Own what you see in yourself and fucking take care of it.</p>
<p>And like hold yourself and everybody around you to new standards.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a difference between being humble and being cocky.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t like being cocky.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like being humble, but being realistic, I do like you have to look at your faults</p>
<p>and also your value and where you excel.</p>
<p>You have to see both like you&rsquo;re going to stay level headed with that.</p>
<p>Because like I said, if anybody that&rsquo;s found this fucking podcast, all you&rsquo;ve done your</p>
<p>whole life is see your fucking faults, how your fuck up, how you&rsquo;re not good enough.</p>
<p>So I need to help you see the other side too.</p>
<p>You need to see both and it will give you a grounded sense of self and like a down to</p>
<p>earth, like reality of who you are.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the good and the bad.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re both.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not just bad.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not talking about go be fucking arrogant.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a better word for like assured?</p>
<p>Like you need to recognize yourself, recognize your own value.</p>
<p>Like stop being fucking humble.</p>
<p>Stop trying to fucking look like a good guy, ignoring and not recognizing and pretending</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t see your own value only hurts you, bitch.</p>
<p>So own that shit.</p>
<p>See it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Because people around you have benefited from you not seeing it for so long because they</p>
<p>got access to something very great for a cheap price.</p>
<p>That ends today.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So another big point with when someone does not like you back, you&rsquo;re basically faced</p>
<p>at a crossroads.</p>
<p>So when someone doesn&rsquo;t like you, you can choose to stay with them and like fight for</p>
<p>them and fight for trying to make them see your value or you can go down the other fucking</p>
<p>road and goddamn leave them and like leave them alone.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do it in like a bitter way.</p>
<p>If they were bitter and fucking rude when they dismissed you, be bitter and rude back.</p>
<p>We mirror, bitch.</p>
<p>But if they&rsquo;re fucking polite, then just be polite, understand, respect their decision,</p>
<p>respect them being honest with you and fucking politely just go on your goddamn way.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re faced at a crossroads here.</p>
<p>But both of these roads take effort to go down.</p>
<p>And what I want you to see is you can go down the road of trying to convince this person</p>
<p>that you like them.</p>
<p>Very fucking hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to take a lot of effort and a lot of energy.</p>
<p>But if you go down the other road, it&rsquo;s going to be the same amount of energy and effort,</p>
<p>but you can put it into finding someone who will see your value.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just which road do you want to go down?</p>
<p>Where do you want to put your effort?</p>
<p>Do you want to put your effort into convincing someone to like you or put your effort into</p>
<p>finding someone who immediately likes you and can recognize your value off the get go</p>
<p>and does not need to be convinced?</p>
<p>Now you know which one I&rsquo;m going to tell you.</p>
<p>Go down, bitch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell you to go down the one where you leave them the fuck alone.</p>
<p>Do not ever let someone tell you they don&rsquo;t want you twice.</p>
<p>They can say it once and they should never fucking hear from you again.</p>
<p>And the way that you can kind of navigate this is use my catchphrase.</p>
<p>And what about it?</p>
<p>So if you are like dealing with someone who doesn&rsquo;t like you back, and what about it?</p>
<p>What now?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my other catchphrase.</p>
<p>So what now?</p>
<p>That puts you square in a place of like reality and decision.</p>
<p>It puts you in control.</p>
<p>This person does not like me.</p>
<p>Okay, what now?</p>
<p>What about it is kind of like more dismissive, but I want you to ask yourself like what now?</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t like you?</p>
<p>Okay, so what now?</p>
<p>Self, what are we going to do?</p>
<p>So what now that I&rsquo;m in the position of like I like this person and they don&rsquo;t like me?</p>
<p>What are we going to do now?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the next action step?</p>
<p>What do we want to do?</p>
<p>But one more thing I want to bring to your awareness about fighting for someone to see</p>
<p>your value is if you are stuck here with your attention on this one person who does</p>
<p>not see your value, you&rsquo;re sitting here trying to convince them to value you and see your</p>
<p>value and your attention is here, your focus is here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not seeing all the other people over here who will not have to be convinced or</p>
<p>shown your value.</p>
<p>They will see it and appreciate you to a degree that you can&rsquo;t fucking imagine.</p>
<p>But your attention is stuck here.</p>
<p>And until you drop this and stop going at this fucking project, which is what this person</p>
<p>is that doesn&rsquo;t want you back, your attention is going to free up and you&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>able to look around and that&rsquo;s when you can see everyone else who will appreciate you</p>
<p>and value you.</p>
<p>You have to free up your focus from the motherfuckers that don&rsquo;t see your value so that you can</p>
<p>line up with and potentially see the ones that will.</p>
<p>And the last thing I want to say about this before we jump into WWLD is do not ever let</p>
<p>someone find you where they left you.</p>
<p>And my biggest fucking revenge, like my biggest, like, oh, it makes my fucking heart happy</p>
<p>to literally like have someone not want me and then level up so hard that I surpass them</p>
<p>and now you can&rsquo;t access me.</p>
<p>Like who the fuck you are is no longer of caliber to access the new me.</p>
<p>Like let this be the kickstart to your fucking greatest level up you&rsquo;ve had.</p>
<p>That truly is the best revenge you can get on somebody because I could not imagine if</p>
<p>someone liked me and I kind of like was fucking them around and I like didn&rsquo;t give them a</p>
<p>time of day.</p>
<p>I was like, eh, whatever.</p>
<p>Like I guess we could be friends and then they leave me alone and then I see them go</p>
<p>level the fuck up and now I become insecure because I&rsquo;m like, damn, like now they&rsquo;re better</p>
<p>than me.</p>
<p>Like, and now I&rsquo;d like, I would never get a fucking chance.</p>
<p>I would fucking kill myself.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Like you leveling up is the best fucking revenge, but it takes a long time and it takes a minute.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not like an immediate gratification, like lighting their house on fire or like</p>
<p>blowing their car up.</p>
<p>Like that makes you feel better immediately or like beating up their new partner.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll make you feel better immediately.</p>
<p>But the true revenge, the ultimate satisfaction, the shit that&rsquo;s going to get you off for the</p>
<p>rest of your life is leveling up so far past them.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t even access you if they fucking wanted to.</p>
<p>Because I have people, I had this one fucking loser on TikTok.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s kind of big and who I was like around a year ago, we were talking and we were like</p>
<p>on the same level, like the way that I looked, the way that I acted, like everything I had</p>
<p>going on, like we were on relatively the same level now.</p>
<p>Oh, he couldn&rsquo;t fucking message me if he fucking tried.</p>
<p>One, I blocked him.</p>
<p>But two, like bitch, we were on the same level and you weren&rsquo;t even like acting worth a shit.</p>
<p>So I cut you the fuck off.</p>
<p>But now my best revenge on him is looking back and seeing that he&rsquo;s still the fucking</p>
<p>same and now I&rsquo;m someone he would dream about being with.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t fucking access me now.</p>
<p>That is revenge, bitch.</p>
<p>Because now he gets to live his life knowing that he fucked shit up with me and he gets</p>
<p>to see the potential of what he could have had and he&rsquo;s never going to fucking get it.</p>
<p>That, you are condemning someone to a lifelong regret when they fumble the bag with you.</p>
<p>Oh my God, it&rsquo;s the most satisfying shit in the world.</p>
<p>Like you could have accessed an older version of me, but the new me, you can&rsquo;t touch, bitch.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not of caliber.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not good enough for the new me.</p>
<p>Oh my God, I can&rsquo;t tell you how good that shit fucking feels.</p>
<p>Like that.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s better than drugs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better than any drug you could think of.</p>
<p>Okay, so now let&rsquo;s jump into what would Leo do where I&rsquo;m going to give you advice.</p>
<p>So our first scenario, this girl started dating this guy that she was best friends</p>
<p>with.</p>
<p>Like they were best friends for a long time and then they went into dating.</p>
<p>And she says he&rsquo;s very sweet, caring.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the funniest person she&rsquo;s met.</p>
<p>She has a lot of mental health issues and this is the first guy that has been able to</p>
<p>like handle her and care about her and be like sweet to her.</p>
<p>But she&rsquo;s not attracted to him and she&rsquo;s never felt like an intense like drive or like desire</p>
<p>for him.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not looking for that feeling of like, like the obsession.</p>
<p>Like I fucking want you.</p>
<p>And she hasn&rsquo;t had that.</p>
<p>And she also says the sex sucks and it&rsquo;s not passionate.</p>
<p>But her main struggle is she&rsquo;s scared to break his heart.</p>
<p>She said he&rsquo;s got a kind heart and she&rsquo;s scared to break his heart and fuck him up because</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s good to her, but she&rsquo;s just not feeling it.</p>
<p>So babe, I&rsquo;ve got you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got you for two different avenues you could go.</p>
<p>So I would look at, am I willing to put in the effort of loving this person?</p>
<p>When I say love logically, this is one of the examples that you have to love logically.</p>
<p>If you can see this person is physically attractive, they meet like, they check off all your boxes,</p>
<p>but you just don&rsquo;t feel that intense like feeling state toward them of like, Oh my God,</p>
<p>I want you.</p>
<p>And like the sex is kind of like meh.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s things you can do to spark that.</p>
<p>So if you can see logically that they&rsquo;re everything that you want and they would be a good stable</p>
<p>person to be with, you can choose to make it work or you can choose to opt out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go into opting out also.</p>
<p>But for now, if you choose to consciously love him and make that shit work, all you</p>
<p>have to do is switch your perspective and your outlook on him.</p>
<p>So a big thing for me when I don&rsquo;t feel like a drive towards somebody is I don&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>respect you.</p>
<p>So look at him and look at what would he need to do so that I could respect him?</p>
<p>Or what would I need to see so that I would start to respect him?</p>
<p>Like how are you looking at him where you just don&rsquo;t feel the urges that you want to</p>
<p>feel?</p>
<p>Like look at what would it take for you to feel the drive that you want to feel toward</p>
<p>him?</p>
<p>What would you have to see in him?</p>
<p>What would he have to be for you to feel that way?</p>
<p>And then start looking for it, flipping perspectives on it, start communicating, start making that</p>
<p>shit work because it can truly happen.</p>
<p>Like if you logically can see someone is great for you and they check off all the boxes,</p>
<p>you just don&rsquo;t feel it.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;re not going to feel it.</p>
<p>Perspectives are not the intense drive.</p>
<p>Like love is not the intense feeling of like, Oh my God, I love you.</p>
<p>Love is a conscious fucking choice.</p>
<p>And you can choose to make the relationship work and those feelings will come because</p>
<p>I swear to God, it only takes a few perspective shifts of how you&rsquo;re looking at this person</p>
<p>to all of a sudden want to fuck.</p>
<p>And he can feel that you are not drawn to him because the sex takes passion from both</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>And if he doesn&rsquo;t feel passion from you, he&rsquo;s not going to feel passionate.</p>
<p>He might feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>So the sex will amp up as soon as you start to respect this person because you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to want to fuck him.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to like have that drive for him.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to want to be affectionate.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to want all that as soon as you change the way that you&rsquo;re seeing him.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;ve tried this and it&rsquo;s just not working or you&rsquo;re someone who wants to run</p>
<p>off of that feeling, like you have to have that feeling of like strong desire towards</p>
<p>someone.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re just not willing to put in the effort to make it work, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with</p>
<p>your decision.</p>
<p>You can choose to stay and make it work or you can choose not to.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not bad for either one.</p>
<p>But to make you feel more comfortable about leaving, if you know that&rsquo;s what you want</p>
<p>to do, you have to see that if you know you are not able to love someone, you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>up the space for someone else to step in that would love them the way that he needs to be</p>
<p>loved.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>So you have to realize if you&rsquo;re going to leave, you&rsquo;re not leaving him and breaking</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>You know you can&rsquo;t love him.</p>
<p>And by stepping out, you&rsquo;re clearing a spot for someone else to step in who can love him</p>
<p>the way that you can.</p>
<p>And that is the best thing you can do if you know that you&rsquo;re not able to love him.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not able to give him what he wants.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not able to care about him the way that you think that he deserves.</p>
<p>Stepping out and letting someone else step in to do that is the best thing for both of</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not selfish.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not mean to like leave him and break his heart.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to suck for a while.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to feel like fucking shit.</p>
<p>But if you know that you cannot love him, that&rsquo;s the right decision to make.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best thing you could do for both of you.</p>
<p>Because flip the situation.</p>
<p>Imagine you loved him and cared about him and he didn&rsquo;t love you and he was just staying</p>
<p>with you out of pity because he feels bad he doesn&rsquo;t want to hurt you.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t want someone to stay with you out of pity.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t want someone to stay just because they didn&rsquo;t want to hurt you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d want them to get the fuck out of the way so someone else could come in.</p>
<p>So like I said, you&rsquo;re not wrong for either decision.</p>
<p>And I hope both explanations of like either decision that you do make brought you clarity</p>
<p>and gave you reassurance that you&rsquo;re not an asshole.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not a dick.</p>
<p>This is workable if you want to work on it.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t want to work on it, I don&rsquo;t know too much about what you&rsquo;re going through.</p>
<p>But from what you wrote in the message, I hope I gave you enough clarity for both.</p>
<p>All right, next situation for what would Leo do?</p>
<p>I fucking love this little segment.</p>
<p>WWLD.</p>
<p>Fuck what would Jesus do, bitch?</p>
<p>I ain&rsquo;t turning the water into wine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving you some real life fucking advice.</p>
<p>So this girl wrote in with such a problem to have.</p>
<p>Everybody just falls in love with her.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m fucking around.</p>
<p>But really, this girl wrote in and said that she becomes friends with guys.</p>
<p>And then they always end up admitting to her that they want to be with her.</p>
<p>Like they confess feelings for her.</p>
<p>And she said that she says in the beginning, look, I just want to be friends.</p>
<p>But then after time goes along, the guys will usually admit like, oh, I&rsquo;ve been in</p>
<p>this for like the long game.</p>
<p>I want to date you like I&rsquo;ve wanted to date you since the beginning.</p>
<p>And I was hoping by being your friend, like you would just develop.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot to unpack with that.</p>
<p>But first thing I want to say is you&rsquo;re not a fucking bitch.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not wrong.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not the asshole.</p>
<p>If you warn these people, I do not want to date you.</p>
<p>If they chose to still go into the friendship, hoping it turns into a relationship and they</p>
<p>hurt their own fucking feelings, that&rsquo;s on them.</p>
<p>You communicated your intentions.</p>
<p>You communicated what it could have been.</p>
<p>Now, if they wanted to go forward with it anyway, with hidden intentions, that&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>fucking them.</p>
<p>You gave them clarity.</p>
<p>You were straight the fuck up from the jump.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not the dick and you never will be the fucking dick.</p>
<p>So I want to give you that peace of mind.</p>
<p>But another thing I want to make you aware of real quick is if you agree with a guy to</p>
<p>become friends, feelings might have developed.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want you to look at every guy you&rsquo;ve been friends with being like, oh, they secretly</p>
<p>just wanted to date me from the beginning.</p>
<p>They lied to me.</p>
<p>They manipulated me this whole time thinking that I would want to date them trying to make</p>
<p>me like them.</p>
<p>Some people might get into a friendship with you and then their feelings might develop</p>
<p>for you.</p>
<p>Like they might not have had any intention of dating you in the beginning.</p>
<p>But after spending time around you, they like you, bitch, and they have feelings for</p>
<p>you and they want to be with you.</p>
<p>So it might not be something that was planned from the beginning.</p>
<p>It might have been something that developed and then they&rsquo;re coming to you with that.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t have too much information based off of what you submitted.</p>
<p>But I just wanted to bring that perspective up to you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a betrayal, like it&rsquo;s just something that developed and now you have to go about</p>
<p>the situation like that.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re still not a dick again for not wanting to go through with it or not wanting</p>
<p>to pursue them like that.</p>
<p>Like you were clear up front at the beginning, this is for friends.</p>
<p>This is not for fucking or a relationship.</p>
<p>Like you were clear and I want to take that weight off of your shoulders.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re going to try and make you the dick because they&rsquo;re hurt.</p>
<p>This whole episode, send it to them when someone don&rsquo;t like you back.</p>
<p>So men have very fragile egos and when they perceive that they&rsquo;re rejected or someone</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t like them, they fucking cope in all kinds of ways.</p>
<p>So typically they&rsquo;ll like attack you.</p>
<p>So like if guys try to make you the dick, here&rsquo;s your reassurance, you&rsquo;re fucking not.</p>
<p>Play this episode as many times as you goddamn need.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not the dick.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not wrong.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not the asshole if you communicated from the beginning.</p>
<p>But one thing I am going to call you out on because I love you and I&rsquo;m always here for</p>
<p>y&rsquo;all and I&rsquo;m going to tell you what you need to hear even if you don&rsquo;t want to hear it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very fair.</p>
<p>So the thing I&rsquo;m going to say is if you flirt with these boys, bitch, what are you fucking</p>
<p>thinks going to happen?</p>
<p>Like if you are just being friends with someone, you have to make sure you&rsquo;re not flirting</p>
<p>with them and you&rsquo;re not taking it past anything platonic.</p>
<p>Because if you guys are just friends and you start flirting with them because you like</p>
<p>the attention, you like the reassurance, you like all that, like I get it, bitch.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t get mad when all of a sudden they start developing feelings for you because</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve had it platonic and then you start flirting, what you&rsquo;re doing is opening their</p>
<p>perspective to seeing you in a different light.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re no longer going to be looking at you as a friend.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to look at you as like, wait, I actually might like this bitch.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to have a whole new perspective on you and it&rsquo;s not going to be friend.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be girlfriend.</p>
<p>So just check if you&rsquo;re the one flirting with them because you might be putting shit in</p>
<p>their head and like making them look at you in a different way that they didn&rsquo;t plan to</p>
<p>look at you in.</p>
<p>But like if you&rsquo;re sending the signals of like you&rsquo;re interested, you flirt and you</p>
<p>be like whatever, they&rsquo;re going to start looking at you like that.</p>
<p>So you got to set up clear boundaries with yourself of like how you will and won&rsquo;t treat</p>
<p>them, how far you&rsquo;re willing to push it to flirt.</p>
<p>You have to watch that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a tricky thing to navigate.</p>
<p>Okay, so situation number three.</p>
<p>This one makes me laugh because bitch me too.</p>
<p>This guy wrote in and said, I have no interest in anyone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so fucking me because bitch like that&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really real and I feel you on that.</p>
<p>But I do have advice for you because this is what I&rsquo;ve had to do.</p>
<p>And once I&rsquo;m ready to start looking for a relationship, this is what I will do to find</p>
<p>someone that catches my interest.</p>
<p>So I want you to look at everything that&rsquo;s like not catching your attention.</p>
<p>Like why do things not impress you?</p>
<p>Why are you not like, why are you not interested in anyone?</p>
<p>And then I want you to look at what would catch your interest?</p>
<p>What would make you like someone?</p>
<p>What would you have to see in someone or how would someone have to be for you to be like,</p>
<p>ooh, bitch, I like you.</p>
<p>Think about what it would take to trigger that feeling for you.</p>
<p>And I really want you to make a list.</p>
<p>Like I love making a motherfucking list.</p>
<p>I make lists for everything.</p>
<p>But real life, make a list of everything it would take for someone to catch your attention</p>
<p>because then you have a fucking blueprint of the type of people you need to be looking</p>
<p>for.</p>
<p>So once you see all the things that would catch your attention, you know, okay, these</p>
<p>are the type people that are this way.</p>
<p>These are the type people that have these qualities and are these things.</p>
<p>Then you can ask yourself, where the fuck do these people hang out?</p>
<p>How the fuck can I get around these people?</p>
<p>How can I meet these type people?</p>
<p>Because if you know what catches your interest, you know what to look for.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not just going to be sitting around and like passively waiting like, oh, I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>waiting for someone to catch my interest.</p>
<p>Take a more empowered approach and put a little more control behind it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just wait for the universe to give you shit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big part of manifestation.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;ve got to fucking put your ass behind it too.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just say you want something.</p>
<p>So look at what would it take for you to be interested in someone?</p>
<p>Then think where would this person be?</p>
<p>Where would these type people be that I would be interested in?</p>
<p>And then go put your ass in those situations and put your ass around them.</p>
<p>Like find these people, seek them out.</p>
<p>And I promise you will come across more people than you realize.</p>
<p>Because this has happened to me a little bit.</p>
<p>Like I made my list and then it&rsquo;s like, as soon as I just declared the things that would</p>
<p>catch my interest, I&rsquo;m seeing it a little bit more and I&rsquo;m like, oh fuck.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t want to have to act on a relationship, I&rsquo;m scared.</p>
<p>But you will honestly be shocked at the amount of people that you start seeing because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actively going to be telling your brain what to look for.</p>
<p>Right now you have no clarity about how to feel interested in someone.</p>
<p>But as soon as you get clarity around it, you&rsquo;re going to train your brain and tell</p>
<p>it what to look for.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re going to start seeing it.</p>
<p>The more you focus on it, the more you&rsquo;re going to see it.</p>
<p>So keep your fucking list nearby.</p>
<p>If this podcast was helpful to you, leave this video a thumbs up.</p>

<p>future episode and you want my advice and my little hot take, send me your situation,</p>
<p>what you got going on.</p>

<p>My Instagram is the Leo Skeppy because I know some shit&rsquo;s private and you don&rsquo;t want like</p>
<p>your business out there.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t give enough identifiers for people to know who it is, but I give you the advice</p>
<p>for your situation.</p>
