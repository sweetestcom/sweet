    <p>Hi friends, I&rsquo;m in a bad mood. I</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know why don&rsquo;t fucking ask me. I</p>
<p>Was two seconds away from recording this episode on the couch like that ass. I was gonna fucking get my mic</p>
<p>I was gonna unplug it and I was gonna go make this</p>
<p>Handheld and like go sit on the couch and just like veg out while I talk to you about Europe, but hi friends</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m officially back from Europe and I have a lot of realizations. I want to share with you and just like things</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. I have some things I want to share and then next week</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably gonna do an episode about</p>
<p>Losing friends not losing friends, but like outgrowing people outgrowing friends and how to navigate that</p>
<p>But I needed to talk about what I learned in Europe because I learned a whole bunch like Leo was</p>
<p>Going the fuck through it. So I&rsquo;m gonna just give you like a</p>
<p>Background and when I say I was going through it, so we got in that fucking fight in Berlin</p>
<p>We got jumped cool the number one</p>
<p>Then we go to Romania and then we&rsquo;ve me and my friend both catch a cold and we&rsquo;re like fighting for our life</p>
<p>Not really. I were like coughing shit up with like a typical cold. You just don&rsquo;t feel good</p>
<p>You want to sleep and then we leave there and we go to Rome and when we get to Rome</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re there for four days the first night. We get food poisoning and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m literally sick in bed throwing up pissing out of my ass for like the four days straight</p>
<p>So I literally flew to Rome ate some pizza. That wasn&rsquo;t good. Apparently from his hyped-up pizza place</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t fucking take recommendations offline. I don&rsquo;t trust nobody&rsquo;s judgment like y&rsquo;all think y&rsquo;all say things are good and it&rsquo;s not good</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never good</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m done. I&rsquo;m done listening to y&rsquo;all like every time I try somebody&rsquo;s Starbucks drink that they recommend. I&rsquo;m like poo. It&rsquo;s fucking shit</p>
<p>But the same thing with food so like no more recommendations for goddamn restaurants, but we go to this fucking restaurant</p>
<p>We get food poisoning. I&rsquo;m sick of shit in Rome. Like it&rsquo;s our oh my god. It makes me so mad</p>
<p>It makes me so upset. I literally saw nothing in Rome</p>
<p>I saw the inside of my Airbnb and the pizza that I ate</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. We didn&rsquo;t see shit else. We didn&rsquo;t do shit else</p>
<p>Like I was literally just sick for four days and I&rsquo;m the type I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m a little tough stuff</p>
<p>Like if I&rsquo;m sick, I don&rsquo;t go fuck I can still function</p>
<p>I can still like get up and be fine</p>
<p>Like when I had my cold I was like, okay, and I can be sick and still do things</p>
<p>So that was not the case with the food poisoning bitch</p>
<p>I was sick in a big day</p>
<p>Like my body would not get up like I had cold sweats like body aches shit show absolute literal shit show</p>
<p>And then we finished our trip off in Madrid, which was pretty it was real nice. It was cute</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad we went because I didn&rsquo;t get to see a fuck thing in Rome. So I have some realizations</p>
<p>I want to share with you about all of that</p>
<p>But I kind of I was gonna go a different route</p>
<p>But like after giving you the background of this like I have like the five little like points</p>
<p>I want to hit on</p>
<p>But I really think I&rsquo;m just gonna jump into the one I learned about being sick in Rome so</p>
<p>When we were in Rome, we were in the perfect location</p>
<p>Like our Airbnb was like it was the most expensive one of the trip and it literally makes me fucking writhe with anger</p>
<p>That I paid all this money to go to Rome and I didn&rsquo;t get to fucking like it wasn&rsquo;t worth anything</p>
<p>Like it was a waste of money</p>
<p>Oh, I literally I just saw the inside the Airbnb like I didn&rsquo;t want I don&rsquo;t want to be positive and be like</p>
<p>Oh like yeah, I was sick, but at least I had a nice place to stay. Fuck that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still upset that I wasted money and didn&rsquo;t get to see nothing in Rome, but that&rsquo;s the point</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of the realization when I was in Rome</p>
<p>I was in the perfect Airbnb in the perfect location could walk to anything. I had money to spend</p>
<p>I was ready to have a good time</p>
<p>But I did not have my health and if you don&rsquo;t have your health</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have shit and I learned that like firsthand and I&rsquo;ve had run-ins with this before like working as a nurse</p>
<p>I saw a lot of shit very young and I understand like if you don&rsquo;t have your health you have nothing and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>Been with people at the end of their life. I&rsquo;ve seen all of that. Like I&rsquo;ve seen everybody&rsquo;s biggest regrets</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen people my fucking age</p>
<p>I was 19 and I was working with the kid that was 18 and he didn&rsquo;t have his health and he was dying like</p>
<p>he was stuck in the hospital with cancer and</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t leave but I could I&rsquo;m getting chills talking about this</p>
<p>But I was 19 at the time and I was like</p>
<p>This fucking kid we are the same age and his life is about to end like if you don&rsquo;t have your health</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have a fuck thing but going to Rome was a nice refresher of that, but</p>
<p>Seriously, like we all get so caught up and like oh, I need to make more money. I don&rsquo;t have enough money</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this it&rsquo;s that like there&rsquo;s so much stress, but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>Money didn&rsquo;t matter when I was sick. I didn&rsquo;t give a fuck like I it didn&rsquo;t matter what location I was in</p>
<p>I could not get up and go explore</p>
<p>I had money to spend finally in the time of my life</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I finally have money to spend and I can&rsquo;t fucking spend it because I don&rsquo;t have my health. Everybody&rsquo;s after</p>
<p>everything and everybody&rsquo;s chasing everything but</p>
<p>Health and it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s this weird dynamic with money</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ll worry about my health once I make money at least that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;ve been like most of my life</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;ll worry about my health once I have money like once I have everything taken care of</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna neglect shit and like discard it until I feel like I&rsquo;m at a place where I like can</p>
<p>Worry about my health. Does that make fucking sense or not? Like make sense to me, but that was a big thing</p>
<p>I was like, I&rsquo;m not worrying about my health till I have money. It&rsquo;s like once I have money, I&rsquo;ll eat right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do this. I&rsquo;ll do that. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>You have to start taking care of your health before that and I learned that like for real and money comes and goes</p>
<p>But I would have paid</p>
<p>Anything to fucking have my health back when I was sick like that shit rocked me</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m no, I&rsquo;m not new to a stomach bug, but like grow that shit got me good</p>
<p>Like I was like damn, but the whole realization was like it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>How perfect your circumstances are you have money you&rsquo;re in the perfect location a beautiful place in the world</p>
<p>You have a place you can go explore. You&rsquo;re with someone that&rsquo;s fun. Like you have a friend. It&rsquo;s like me a</p>
<p>Couple of years ago like I didn&rsquo;t have anyone I was friends with like close with like that</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have like money to go travel and do shit</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like all I wanted was like money because I was like money a friend</p>
<p>Take a trip see the world and it&rsquo;s like I finally got all of that and I got everything I wanted</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t have my health to enjoy it like having friends doesn&rsquo;t fucking matter</p>
<p>Having money doesn&rsquo;t fucking matter being somewhere and new in the world having beautiful things around you doesn&rsquo;t fucking matter if you can&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>Enjoy it. Like I could not get up out of the bed. Like my body was like not having it</p>
<p>It was like I was nauseous. I was sick. I was dizzy</p>
<p>I had a fucking headache from hell like my head was killing me</p>
<p>like I couldn&rsquo;t get up and go like see anything and even if I did like</p>
<p>Force myself to get up and get out of bed. I would have not been able to enjoy any of it</p>
<p>I would have been like I just want to go lay the fuck down</p>
<p>So with that realization my biggest thing was like don&rsquo;t take shit for granted like your ability to just get up and walk outside</p>
<p>is a lot and</p>
<p>You have so much access to like beautiful things like just walking outside</p>
<p>I sound like a fucking goddamn hippie don&rsquo;t I like a fucking tree hug, bro</p>
<p>but for real like to just be able to walk outside and like</p>
<p>See things go see a fucking tree to just be able to get up and like leave your house</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s just such a big thing</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t realize like we all take it for granted like the little moments the little things we take it all for granted until you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have it so my big realization with that was like motherfuckers start taking care of your health like start taking care of yourself and</p>
<p>Really make sure you&rsquo;re able to enjoy life because money doesn&rsquo;t fucking matter people don&rsquo;t matter nothing matters</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t enjoy it like your health will fuck you up if you don&rsquo;t take care of it</p>
<p>So that was my big thing and I&rsquo;m still gonna have fun with life. I&rsquo;m still gonna have a cigarette here and there</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still gonna fucking do a little like</p>
<p>here and there</p>
<p>Like when it calls for it like a festival or something like I&rsquo;m still gonna like have fun with life</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still gonna indulge in things even if they&rsquo;re bad for me, but like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m done eating bad food</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m done eating like bad shit and that&rsquo;s the other thing I wanted to talk about one of my other realizations was like</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so much easier</p>
<p>To eat good and like it&rsquo;s easier to like lose weight in the US because there&rsquo;s no fat-free low calorie anything</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no sugar-free shit. Like you have a sugar-free coke and that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>If you ever go to Europe Romania is the only place that had them actually it&rsquo;s diet Pepsi, but it&rsquo;s mango flavor</p>
<p>Bitch, oh my god those ten out of ten</p>
<p>But my point with this is you you can&rsquo;t like find sugar-free anything. You can&rsquo;t find shit and</p>
<p>The food over there like I saw a very like I saw poor parts of the world and I experienced a lot of shit with</p>
<p>That but like we&rsquo;re just wanting to be able to eat right and like nourish my body</p>
<p>It was a little bit more difficult in these places. So like coming back home. Like I&rsquo;m happy to fucking eat clean</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to be like on my meal plan and be doing my shit</p>
<p>Like I have just so much gratitude and I&rsquo;m an ungrateful fuck. Okay, and this is gonna lead me into my next realization</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an ungrateful fuck. I don&rsquo;t like the whole</p>
<p>Trying to like force yourself to be grateful make a gratitude list like you&rsquo;re fucking shit every morning like three things you grateful for</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t fucking like that. I hate that</p>
<p>I hate having to put effort into trying to be appreciative or grateful</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>I know I have a lot and I have a lot more than most and I have a lot of things me appreciate it for</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t like to fucking put effort into appreciating me like I don&rsquo;t want to fucking sit here and write it down</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to sit here and have to force myself to be grateful for shit. It just feels like I don&rsquo;t like it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exhausting. I&rsquo;m tired of it. I don&rsquo;t feel good doing it. I&rsquo;m gonna grateful. Fuck. All right</p>
<p>I always want more bigger better faster</p>
<p>but it does feel good to be grateful and</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not gonna intentionally try and do it</p>
<p>I found kind of like a cheat code</p>
<p>To be more grateful and feel more appreciative and like I don&rsquo;t feel like life is hard up anymore at all</p>
<p>Like after seeing all these different ways of life and how people live I thought I was struggling bitch</p>
<p>I thought I had something to complain about fuck. No. Okay. No, I have no room to complain</p>
<p>I have no room to do nothing. Like I&rsquo;m like born again. I&rsquo;m a new virgin</p>
<p>Born-again virgin like I&rsquo;m a grateful fuck now, but the thing is I don&rsquo;t have to intentionally try to be grateful</p>
<p>I kind of like hacked the system</p>
<p>You have to go experience the lack of things that you didn&rsquo;t even realize you appreciated in order to feel grateful</p>
<p>And it takes no effort</p>
<p>So like me traveling to these countries and I couldn&rsquo;t access certain things or I couldn&rsquo;t do certain things and live the way that</p>
<p>I wanted to and do things that made me comfortable</p>
<p>I experienced the lack of a lot and it made me so appreciative</p>
<p>Without having to try like I&rsquo;m just such a happy dick now</p>
<p>Like just like being back in the US and just like living day-to-day life. I&rsquo;m a happy fuck. I have my health. I</p>
<p>Barely have any money left. I spent all that fucking trip</p>
<p>But I have like so much</p>
<p>To be appreciative of and I&rsquo;ve it&rsquo;s like taking no effort to do it</p>
<p>Like just experiencing the lack of so many things</p>
<p>health food resources</p>
<p>Experiences like things that make me comfortable</p>
<p>Gyms that are decent like experiencing the lack of all that made me realize how fucking good I have it and it&rsquo;s like I just</p>
<p>Walk around now with every little thing. I&rsquo;m just so appreciative of it without having to try and</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my little like hack. I found was like don&rsquo;t try to force yourself to be grateful go experience the lack of things go</p>
<p>Experience other shit and it&rsquo;s not like I intentionally took this trip and was like, oh, I&rsquo;m gonna be so much more grateful afterward</p>
<p>I had no clue what the fuck was coming. There are so many things. I didn&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>That is a luxury. I know that sounds so fucking stupid like these realizations sound just like dumb like they get better</p>
<p>I think I don&rsquo;t fucking know</p>
<p>But this is just like the things that I realize and they sound so small and so stupid</p>
<p>But like I said, I&rsquo;m an ungrateful fuck until now like I don&rsquo;t like to intentionally have to try and be grateful for things</p>
<p>But this made it so easy</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t have to try and like make a fucking list and like write down things. I&rsquo;m grateful for like</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to none of that like just experiencing a way of life and living a certain way for like a month</p>
<p>Made me a happy dick</p>
<p>All right. I&rsquo;m put a little chapstick on and then we&rsquo;re gonna go into the next one</p>
<p>Oh, I just got pissed off reading it. I</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a mess over here. My biceps keep like twitching cuz like I haven&rsquo;t I didn&rsquo;t get to work out very much in</p>
<p>My little Europe trip. So like I went back to the gym today</p>
<p>I did back and biceps and like I haven&rsquo;t trained my biceps in a minute</p>
<p>So like they keep cramping or like doing like this like they&rsquo;ll cramp real bad and they&rsquo;ll like do that move. Oh my god</p>
<p>Okay, so the one that&rsquo;s gonna piss me off I&rsquo;m gonna hit it real quick</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give you my tip of how I like</p>
<p>Stop being so angry all the time and then I&rsquo;m gonna get into the next one about the pace of life of Europe and like</p>
<p>Enjoying small things and how living is not like a waste of time to them. But the airport I</p>
<p>Fucking despise</p>
<p>People at the airport. I love flying. I love the experience of going to the airport, but the motherfucking people are so</p>
<p>stupid</p>
<p>situationally unaware</p>
<p>Fucking inept like they&rsquo;re just goddamn idiots. Like I I don&rsquo;t know why the airport brings out the worst of people</p>
<p>It brings out the worst of me because people are so goddamn stupid</p>
<p>But going to the airport anytime I had an interaction with a human being especially like other passengers</p>
<p>And also people who didn&rsquo;t know how to do their fucking jobs that work at the airport</p>
<p>Oh that pisses me off, too</p>
<p>I was so angry so often when I was traveling like I had to catch a lot of flights and I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>I just kept getting so angry in the airports and I was just looking around like anytime someone would do something</p>
<p>I would get so fucking pissed. I&rsquo;m like you&rsquo;re fucking stupid and that is like</p>
<p>When I checked myself, so I was okay</p>
<p>Leo looking around that everybody and telling yourself when they do something and consider it that they&rsquo;re just fucking stupid is</p>
<p>Pissing you off. So what&rsquo;s the thought that could make you feel better?</p>
<p>Okay, what else could you say besides they&rsquo;re a fucking idiot that will make you feel better about</p>
<p>this experience and like take off some of this anger and its aggression and this rage because I was ready to just fucking swing like</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re walking through the airport and</p>
<p>motherfuckers just stop right in front of you in</p>
<p>The middle like the walkway when you&rsquo;re driving you dumb shit. Do you just stop in the middle of the fucking road?</p>
<p>No, why because you&rsquo;ll get hit</p>
<p>Okay, move your fucking ass people that just stop in the middle when they&rsquo;re walking</p>
<p>Oh, it gripes my ass and makes my fucking ass itch. I</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>Instead of looking at these people and be like Leo. They&rsquo;re just fucking stupid. I was like, okay</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the thought that would make me feel better to think it?</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>I was trying to like be the positive Polly and like make myself feel better and I decided to start saying they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>distracted</p>
<p>Instead of saying they&rsquo;re fucking stupid because when I look at people and I&rsquo;m like you&rsquo;re fucking stupid being stupid is a fucking choice</p>
<p>Being situationally unaware as a choice being inconsiderate is a choice</p>
<p>People can educate themselves people can look around a fucking room and understand</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m walking down a heavily fucking trafficked hallway, basically, and there&rsquo;s a lot of people behind me</p>
<p>Maybe not stop walking in the middle</p>
<p>Maybe fucking not like you have the ability to become aware and to be considerate and to be smart and educate yourself</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your fucking choice to be stupid. So that&rsquo;s why it was making me so angry</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, how are y&rsquo;all so fucking inept? So looking at people and saying, okay, they&rsquo;re just distracted</p>
<p>Like maybe they&rsquo;re trying to like they get on their phone and they stop walking. Whatever it is. You got on your phone</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re distracted. You&rsquo;re trying to figure out what gate you&rsquo;re at. You&rsquo;re distracted. You think you just went the wrong way</p>
<p>So you stopped whatever but I just flipped it instead of looking at people and being like you&rsquo;re fucking stupid</p>
<p>I would just think to my I was not saying that I was thinking it in my head couple people I did yell at but</p>
<p>But in my head, I would just think</p>
<p>Okay, they&rsquo;re just distracted and it made me feel so much better</p>
<p>Like it made me feel so much more calm because I didn&rsquo;t feel like it was a personal thing</p>
<p>Like I wasn&rsquo;t so like what&rsquo;s it called like ignited by it?</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t like fueled with like rage and like get pissed off</p>
<p>Because people are just dumb like just walking around the world looking at people like they&rsquo;re fucking dumb</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s gonna piss you off. So just looking at it and saying, okay, they&rsquo;re distracted. They&rsquo;re not stupid. They&rsquo;re just distracted</p>
<p>That made me feel a lot better</p>
<p>So I wanted to share it and I know it kind of sounds like small and like a stupid thing</p>
<p>But it really did help me like it made me feel a lot better inside. So I wanted to share it</p>
<p>I hope that it isn&rsquo;t like dumb though. Like are people even gonna give a fuck about this episode Leo?</p>
<p>Are they?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>So something else I want to talk about that kind of goes with like a realization. I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the pace of life in Europe versus the United States like Europe</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t look at you</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re a waste or that you are wasting your life if you are living like if you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>Experiencing like being alive in the u.s</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if you&rsquo;re just alive and awake and you&rsquo;re not doing anything</p>
<p>People look at you like you&rsquo;re a fuck-up like you&rsquo;re a waste like there&rsquo;s this pressure to constantly be doing shit all the time and in</p>
<p>Europe people don&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have that pressure on them all the time and they don&rsquo;t look at each other like</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a fuck-up or that they&rsquo;re like not good or like they&rsquo;re just something&rsquo;s wrong with them</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just like lazy if they enjoy</p>
<p>Living life like I&rsquo;m talking the little moments like literally this is a stupid example, but walking outside to have a motherfucking cigarette</p>
<p>People in Europe smoke cigarettes people don&rsquo;t vape in Europe</p>
<p>you want to know why because they don&rsquo;t look at walking outside and</p>
<p>Having a cigarette for like five minutes as a waste of time</p>
<p>The u.s. Is so up your fucking ass about don&rsquo;t waste time be efficient act fast</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like everything is like go go go</p>
<p>You have to be moving all the time and like you your biggest fear is like wasting time and looking like a fuck-up</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of like the theory I have around vapes like vaping. It&rsquo;s so accessible. It&rsquo;s easy</p>
<p>You can do it as you work. It&rsquo;s like you can it doesn&rsquo;t slow you down like to vape</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t slow you down at all to go take a break walk outside</p>
<p>Smoke a cigarette like that&rsquo;s a whole like little experience, you know</p>
<p>So vaping and like in the u.s. It&rsquo;s so popular here because it&rsquo;s just it makes you it feels more efficient</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an inconvenience</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re allowed to stay on track and not like waste time or be a fuck-up</p>
<p>Because you go smoke a cigarette so like I love in Europe that they just take a minute to go do anything</p>
<p>Like when they eat</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just in the moment</p>
<p>They hang out like when you go to a restaurant</p>
<p>The waiters and waitresses are not in a rush like they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;ll get to you when they fucking get to you and I kind of</p>
<p>like it like it&rsquo;s annoying when I&rsquo;m ready to fucking go, but</p>
<p>it is nice to just</p>
<p>Relax and just like not feel that pressure of like the go-go-go fast fast fast</p>
<p>Everything has to be like not a waste of time. Like that&rsquo;s a stressful fucking thing like a stressful way to live but</p>
<p>people in Europe</p>
<p>They just focus on living and they don&rsquo;t look at it like it&rsquo;s a waste</p>
<p>so like the joy in the little moments of life like to sit down and have a cup of coffee or like</p>
<p>sit down and enjoy your meal and talk to the people that you&rsquo;re with or go outside and have a fucking cigarette like for</p>
<p>45 minutes you just slow down and you just live in the moment and it&rsquo;s normal and that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird to not do that. It&rsquo;s weird to be so fast and stressed and like chaotic but in the u.s</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird to exist and that&rsquo;s a big realization. I had I was like, you know, like we really over</p>
<p>giving stupid</p>
<p>And another big thing I realized is people in Europe are not distracted like in the u.s</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I said, there&rsquo;s such a fast pace. It&rsquo;s like you constantly have to be doing shit and everybody&rsquo;s so distracted all the time</p>
<p>But in Europe people are not distracted because they&rsquo;re living in the moment</p>
<p>Even if they&rsquo;re playing on their phone or like doing something they&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not like their brain is not divided and split in 500 directions</p>
<p>So like when you talk to somebody they&rsquo;re present and it&rsquo;s a nice feeling like it&rsquo;s the weirdest fucking shit</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t think it was like that big of a deal until I&rsquo;m like back in the u.s</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a bad thing</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m like that like I&rsquo;m very like a mile a minute like fucking go-go-go all the time</p>
<p>Split with my focus in every fucking direction and I&rsquo;ve realized after coming home from Europe like take a fucking second</p>
<p>You know, like it&rsquo;s not a waste to go just like chill for a minute. It&rsquo;s not a waste to be present</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a waste to anything like being present with any moment is</p>
<p>Like a big thing like even just driving down the road or like fucking having a cup of coffee like it&rsquo;s not a waste</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you don&rsquo;t always have to be looking for how you can be most efficient with your time to not waste it</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re not a fuck-up. You&rsquo;re not a piece of shit</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not a failure because you aren&rsquo;t running a thousand fucking miles an hour all the time in every direction</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just a nice freedom and to go like for me to talk about it&rsquo;s cute</p>
<p>But to go experience it like I highly recommend like going to a different country go experience different cultures different shit</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna incorporate that into my life. Like I am smoking cigarettes again</p>
<p>I have the whole thing about like I quit nicotine like I quit vaping</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>going to Europe</p>
<p>Bitch, I have a cigarette now, but I don&rsquo;t use like I don&rsquo;t smoke cuz I&rsquo;m like fiending for it</p>
<p>Like I kind of like brought back the ritual from Europe and I like I don&rsquo;t smoke inside</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very paranoid and like</p>
<p>Conscious about the way that I smell. I don&rsquo;t want to smell like a fucking cigarette. I don&rsquo;t want to stink. So</p>
<p>Whenever I&rsquo;m like doing shit, like I&rsquo;ll just take a little break</p>
<p>Take a minute go outside and just slow down</p>
<p>Just have a cigarette and fucking just chill for a minute. Like I just like</p>
<p>Cuz I can&rsquo;t smoke inside so it&rsquo;s inconvenient like vaping you can do everywhere</p>
<p>You can fucking do it in the shower like you can literally do that anytime any day</p>
<p>But like to go just take a break for a second go smoke a fucking cigarette like oh my god</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not telling you to do it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying like for me I just slow down for a second and it like regrounds me and I just feel fine</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even that it&rsquo;s the cigarette</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like just taking that break and not feeling bad for it and just like coming back to myself in the moment</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like my meditation like I fucking meditate with cigarette</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all sit down and close your eyes and do your little shit. I go have a fucking cigarette and that&rsquo;s my meditation</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just like a minute to just chill and relax</p>
<p>So I think I&rsquo;m gonna do a podcast episode about my whole like a nicotine experience like quitting nicotine</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s really not that fucking hard. And after I quit for like three weeks. I was like</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as hard as I thought it would be I did it like there was no withdrawal</p>
<p>It was not like this fucking giant task</p>
<p>I thought it would be and I have the self-control where I can like have a cigarette here and there if I want one</p>
<p>So like every day I like I&rsquo;ll have like one or two and I just enjoy that little moment</p>
<p>If I get out of hand with it and I&rsquo;m smoking like 10 a fucking day, I&rsquo;m gonna like cool it</p>
<p>You know like a pack. I&rsquo;ll like no we&rsquo;re not doing that</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ll have like one or two cigarettes a day, but it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s intention behind it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like oh, I&rsquo;m gonna I need to go smoke. It&rsquo;s like I need a cigarette</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m gonna just go chill for a second. Take my little break. So</p>
<p>Yeah, I just I just wanted to talk about that. Like I love the whole like slower pace of life</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s still moving. Everybody&rsquo;s still doing things, but everybody&rsquo;s present and I guess that&rsquo;s the thing that I like the most</p>
<p>And they like experience in it. It was just so fucking nice</p>
<p>Okay, this episode is not long enough. Oh my god. Okay, I guess I don&rsquo;t want to talk about this last one</p>
<p>But I guess I will</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>Going to different countries. I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it</p>
<p>Leo just fucking telling your story you hooked up with somebody. Okay, so be it</p>
<p>So I hooked up with someone when I was in where the fuck was I Madrid?</p>
<p>The boys there is fucking delicious</p>
<p>Alright, like I did get tired of walking around in public though</p>
<p>Cuz like I&rsquo;m like a decent looking person for like a normal place, but like in Madrid everybody was cute</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t like going out. I was like why everybody hi</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m fucking insecure, but</p>
<p>On some real shit. I hooked up with someone and the realization I had around hookups</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I knew I was done with hookups before like I haven&rsquo;t hooked up with a with anyone in like</p>
<p>Four months since August like however many months that&rsquo;s been it&rsquo;s like August to now</p>
<p>it was like that last one I told you guys about in my hookup culture episode like I haven&rsquo;t hooked up with anyone and</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t really like that into it bad like even then but like I hooked up with someone in</p>
<p>Madrid cuz I was like fucking I&rsquo;m out of country I could do me</p>
<p>So like I just hooked up with someone and it was great</p>
<p>It was fun. The guy was hot as shit. Like it was a great hookup like everything physically like went good</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>mentally</p>
<p>Check the fuck out like I just was not into it. I was not with it like the more aware you get the less</p>
<p>Pleasure the least the less is that the correct English?</p>
<p>But the more aware you get like the less pleasure you get out of things because you&rsquo;re aware of what&rsquo;s actually going on</p>
<p>Like I tried to be in the moment and just enjoy it for what it was like</p>
<p>It was just the hookup, but I&rsquo;m someone that oh my god</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so annoying to say this but like I&rsquo;m someone that</p>
<p>Values sex more now, like I don&rsquo;t like to be sexual with someone if I don&rsquo;t know them one or two</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any kind of like attachment or like connection with them. Like I have no</p>
<p>Desire really I can force it. Like I can fucking get it up and have a good time, but I&rsquo;m just like</p>
<p>Like this is it but I realize with hookups like they&rsquo;re not it like it&rsquo;s not fun</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re empty as fuck and you don&rsquo;t really get anything out of it</p>
<p>And you just get like a little bit of headache. Like that&rsquo;s really all that comes from it cuz it&rsquo;s like I</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fucking know dude. Like I thought I was done with hookups before but it&rsquo;s like I had to like check</p>
<p>I had a hookup and it&rsquo;s like now I know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>1000% just like over it. Like I have no</p>
<p>Desire or interest and like even when I was going to hook up with the dude like I wasn&rsquo;t even that fucking excited</p>
<p>I was like, okay, I guess I&rsquo;m gonna go do it. Like I&rsquo;m in a new country. Fuck it. Like I&rsquo;ll just go for it</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just it ain&rsquo;t it ain&rsquo;t it no more like it&rsquo;s really not</p>
<p>shits and like that&rsquo;s kind of like sad to realize cuz like</p>
<p>All the things that people derive so much pleasure out of I don&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>Pleasure in anymore, like there&rsquo;s certain things. I used to find pleasure in like hookups and like drug</p>
<p>but now</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve become so aware it&rsquo;s like I understand everything for what it is like</p>
<p>Service level deeper and then even at the core of it. Like I understand shit just I&rsquo;m fucking annoyed cuz it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>Everything that everybody says like this is what you should want. This is what you should this will make you happy</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t it doesn&rsquo;t make me happy</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t enjoy it like the things that people derive joy from I don&rsquo;t it doesn&rsquo;t work for me</p>
<p>Like I see how empty it is and it makes me sad to engage in it and</p>
<p>Then be disappointed or like not feel anything</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like damn like you kind of feel like defective or like flawed cuz I&rsquo;m someone that&rsquo;s not run by my sexual desires. I</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t put a lot of like value into sex or like getting off</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the more I&rsquo;ve waken up the more I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m unimpressed. I&rsquo;m indifferent</p>
<p>Everybody is so run by it like sex is so fucking fun to so many people and so many people love to go out and</p>
<p>Fuck and I&rsquo;m just like I feel disconnected from people cuz I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t share that with you</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel that I don&rsquo;t have those urges. I don&rsquo;t like value that</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t value things that other people value and that&rsquo;s kind of like the hard part about growing up too fast</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m I just don&rsquo;t get it</p>
<p>like I can&rsquo;t relate to people anymore and it&rsquo;s kind of like isolating when you aren&rsquo;t someone that&rsquo;s run by sexual desires, so I</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s kind of a realization with that</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a lot more about why I&rsquo;m done with hookups than just like oh, I&rsquo;m just not feeling it</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s kind of like a disappointment. Like I said, it disconnects me from people. I can&rsquo;t relate to people</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand that side of other people like I get it. I&rsquo;ve been there</p>
<p>I used to like be run by that shit. Not really like kinda I</p>
<p>Always had self-control</p>
<p>but I did make some like stupid fucking decisions and I was like just so horny and feeling it when I was like 18 19 where</p>
<p>I was like, ah, fuck it. I&rsquo;ll drop my standards and go fuck. It&rsquo;s like I</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do that anymore because I&rsquo;ve developed myself and my awareness and my like mental capacity and all this shit. It&rsquo;s like cool. I</p>
<p>used to</p>
<p>Do that like I understand why y&rsquo;all do it</p>
<p>But I guess I&rsquo;m just kind of disappointed where I&rsquo;m like y&rsquo;all haven&rsquo;t outgrown it</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all haven&rsquo;t like moved past it</p>
<p>like you still think there&rsquo;s something in that like I see how empty it is and I see so many people chasing it and I</p>
<p>Think that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m just like I don&rsquo;t get it</p>
<p>I just kind of I&rsquo;m standing there and I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>Like y&rsquo;all don&rsquo;t see it</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all still revolving your life around that like you&rsquo;re fucking up your experiences and doing all this shit just to go. Fuck like I</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know</p>

<p>Let me know if you liked it because I don&rsquo;t fucking know like I don&rsquo;t know what this one like this one was like</p>
<p>The shit I&rsquo;m talking about seems like cookie-cutter and stupid but like it was big to me. I don&rsquo;t know</p>
