    <p>The following is a conversation with Rodney Brooks, one of the greatest roboticists in history.</p>
<p>He led the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT,</p>
<p>then cofounded iRobot, which is one of the most successful robotics companies ever.</p>
<p>Then he cofounded Rethink Robotics that created some amazing collaborative robots like Baxter</p>
<p>and Sawyer. Finally, he cofounded Robust.ai, whose mission is to teach robots common sense,</p>
<p>which is a lot harder than it sounds. To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that Rodney is someone I&rsquo;ve looked up to for many years in my now over</p>
<p>two decade journey in robotics because, one, he&rsquo;s a legit great engineer of real world systems,</p>
<p>and two, he&rsquo;s not afraid to state controversial opinions that challenge the way we see the AI</p>
<p>world. But of course, while I agree with him on some of his critical views of AI, I don&rsquo;t agree</p>
<p>with some others, and he&rsquo;s fully supportive of such disagreement. Nobody ever built anything great</p>
<p>by being fully agreeable. There&rsquo;s always respect and love behind our interactions, and when a</p>
<p>conversation is recorded like it was for this podcast, I think a little bit of disagreement is</p>
<p>fun. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and here is my conversation with Rodney Brooks.</p>
<p>What is the most amazing or beautiful robot that you&rsquo;ve ever had the chance to work with?</p>
<p>I think it was Domo, which was made by one of my grad students, Aaron Edsinger. It now sits in</p>
<p>Daniela Russo&rsquo;s office, director of CSAIL, and it was just a beautiful robot. Aaron was really</p>
<p>clever. He didn&rsquo;t give me a budget ahead of time. He didn&rsquo;t tell me what he was going to do.</p>
<p>He just started spending money. He spent a lot of money. He and Jeff Weber, who is a mechanical</p>
<p>engineer who Aaron insisted he bring with him when he became a grad student, built this beautiful,</p>
<p>gorgeous robot, Domo, which is an upper torso humanoid, two arms with fingers, three fingered</p>
<p>hands, and face eyeballs. Not the eyeballs, but everything else, series elastic actuators.</p>
<p>You can interact with it. Cable driven. All the motors are inside, and it&rsquo;s just gorgeous.</p>
<p>The eyeballs are actuated too, or no?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, the eyeballs are actuated with cameras, so it had a visual attention mechanism,</p>
<p>looking when people came in and looking in their face and talking with them.</p>
<p>Wow, was it amazing?</p>
<p>The beauty of it.</p>
<p>You said what was the most beautiful?</p>
<p>What is the most beautiful?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just mechanically gorgeous. As everything Aaron builds,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always been mechanically gorgeous. It&rsquo;s just exquisite in the detail.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about mechanically, like literally the amount of actuators.</p>
<p>The actuators, the cables, he anodizes different parts, different colors,</p>
<p>and it just looks like a work of art.</p>
<p>What about the face? Do you find the face beautiful in robots?</p>
<p>When you make a robot, it&rsquo;s making a promise for how well it will be able to interact,</p>
<p>so I always encourage my students not to overpromise.</p>
<p>Even with its essence, like the thing it presents, it should not overpromise.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the joke I make, which I think you&rsquo;ll get, is if your robot looks like Albert Einstein,</p>
<p>it should be as smart as Albert Einstein.</p>
<p>So the only thing in Domo&rsquo;s face is the eyeballs, because that&rsquo;s all it can do.</p>
<p>It can look at you and pay attention.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like one of those Japanese robots that looks exactly like a person at all.</p>
<p>But see, the thing is, us humans and dogs, too, don&rsquo;t just use eyes as attentional mechanisms.</p>
<p>They also use it to communicate, as part of the communication.</p>
<p>Like a dog can look at you, look at another thing, and look back at you,</p>
<p>and that designates that we&rsquo;re going to be looking at that thing together.</p>
<p>Yeah, or intent, you know, on both Baxter and Sawyer at Rethink Robotics,</p>
<p>they had a screen with, you know, graphic eyes,</p>
<p>so it wasn&rsquo;t actually where the cameras were pointing, but the eyes would look in the direction</p>
<p>it was about to move its arm, so people in the factory nearby were not surprised by its motions,</p>
<p>because it gave that intent away.</p>
<p>Before we talk about Baxter, which I think is a beautiful robot, let&rsquo;s go back to the beginning.</p>
<p>When did you first fall in love with robotics?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about beauty and love to open the conversation.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>I was born in the end of 1954, and I grew up in Adelaide, South Australia,</p>
<p>and I have these two books that are dated 1961, so I&rsquo;m guessing my mother found them in a store</p>
<p>in 62 or 63, How and Why Wonder Books.</p>
<p>How and Why Wonder Book of Electricity, and a How and Why Wonder Book of Giant Brains and Robots.</p>
<p>And I learned how to build circuits, you know, when I was eight or nine, simple circuits,</p>
<p>and I read, you know, learned the binary system, and saw all these drawings, mostly, of robots,</p>
<p>and then I tried to build them for the rest of my childhood.</p>
<p>Wait, 61, you said?</p>
<p>This was when the two books, I&rsquo;ve still got them at home.</p>
<p>What does the robot mean in that context?</p>
<p>Some of the robots that they had were arms, you know, big arms to move nuclear material around,</p>
<p>but they had pictures of welding robots that looked like humans under the sea, welding stuff</p>
<p>underwater.</p>
<p>So they weren&rsquo;t real robots, but they were, you know, what people were thinking about for robots.</p>
<p>What were you thinking about?</p>
<p>Were you thinking about humanoids?</p>
<p>Were you thinking about arms with fingers?</p>
<p>Were you thinking about faces or colors?</p>
<p>Were you thinking about faces or cars?</p>
<p>No, actually, to be honest, I realized my limitation on building mechanical stuff.</p>
<p>So I just built the brains, mostly, out of different technologies as I got older.</p>
<p>I built a learning system which was chemical based, and I had this ice cube tray.</p>
<p>Each well was a cell, and by applying voltage to the two electrodes, it would build up a</p>
<p>copper bridge.</p>
<p>So over time, it would learn a simple network so I could teach it stuff.</p>
<p>And mostly, things were driven by my budget, and nails as electrodes and an ice cube tray</p>
<p>was about my budget at that stage.</p>
<p>Later, I managed to buy transistors, and I could build gates and flip flops and stuff.</p>
<p>So one of your first robots was an ice cube tray?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was very cerebral because it learned to add.</p>
<p>Very nice.</p>
<p>Well, just a decade or so before, in 1950, Alan Turing wrote a paper that formulated</p>
<p>the Turing Test, and he opened that paper with the question, can machines think?</p>
<p>So let me ask you this question.</p>
<p>Can machines think?</p>
<p>Can your ice cube tray one day think?</p>
<p>Certainly, machines can think because I believe you&rsquo;re a machine, and I&rsquo;m a machine, and I</p>
<p>believe we both think.</p>
<p>I think any other philosophical position is sort of a little ludicrous.</p>
<p>What does think mean if it&rsquo;s not something that we do?</p>
<p>And we are machines.</p>
<p>So yes, machines can, but do we have a clue how to build such machines?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very different question.</p>
<p>Are we capable of building such machines?</p>
<p>Are we smart enough?</p>
<p>We think we&rsquo;re smart enough to do anything, but maybe we&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;re just not smart enough to build stuff like us.</p>
<p>The kind of computer that Alan Turing was thinking about, do you think there is something</p>
<p>fundamentally or significantly different between the computer between our ears, the biological</p>
<p>computer that humans use, and the computer that he was thinking about from a sort of</p>
<p>high level philosophical?</p>
<p>Yeah, I believe that it&rsquo;s very wrong.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m halfway through a, I think it&rsquo;ll be about a 480 page book, the working title</p>
<p>is Not Even Wrong.</p>
<p>And if I may, I&rsquo;ll tell you a bit about that book.</p>
<p>Yes, please.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two, well, three thrusts to it.</p>
<p>One is the history of computation, what we call computation.</p>
<p>It goes all the way back to some manuscripts in Latin from 1614 and 1620 by Napier and</p>
<p>Kepler through Babbage and Lovelace.</p>
<p>And then Turing&rsquo;s 1936 paper is what we think of as the invention of modern computation.</p>
<p>And that paper, by the way, did not set out to invent computation.</p>
<p>It set out to negatively answer one of Hilbert&rsquo;s three later set of problems.</p>
<p>He called it an effective way of getting answers.</p>
<p>And Hilbert really worked with rewriting rules, as did Church, who also, at the same time,</p>
<p>a month earlier than Turing, disproved Hilbert&rsquo;s one of these three hypotheses.</p>
<p>The other two had already been disproved by G√∂del.</p>
<p>Turing set out to disprove it, because it&rsquo;s always easier to disprove these things than</p>
<p>to prove that there is an answer.</p>
<p>And so he needed, and it really came from his professor while I was an undergrad at</p>
<p>Cambridge, who turned it into, is there a mechanical process?</p>
<p>So he wanted to show a mechanical process that could calculate numbers, because that</p>
<p>was a mechanical process that people used to generate tables.</p>
<p>They were called computers, the people at the time.</p>
<p>And they followed a set of rules where they had paper, and they would write numbers down,</p>
<p>and based on the numbers, they&rsquo;d keep writing other numbers.</p>
<p>And they would produce numbers for these tables, engineering tables, that the more iterations</p>
<p>they did, the more significant digits came out.</p>
<p>And so Turing, in that paper, set out to define what sort of machine could do that, mechanical</p>
<p>machine, where it could produce an arbitrary number of digits in the same way a human computer</p>
<p>did.</p>
<p>And he came up with a very simple set of constraints where there was an infinite supply</p>
<p>of paper.</p>
<p>This is the tape of the Turing machine, and each Turing machine came with a set of instructions</p>
<p>that, as a person, could do with pencil and paper, write down things on the tape and erase</p>
<p>them and put new things there.</p>
<p>And he was able to show that that system was not able to do something that Hilbert had</p>
<p>hypothesized, so he disproved it.</p>
<p>But he had to show that this system was good enough to do whatever could be done, but couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do this other thing.</p>
<p>And there he said, and he says in the paper, I don&rsquo;t have any real arguments for this,</p>
<p>but based on intuition.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how he defined computation.</p>
<p>And then if you look over the next, from 1936 up until really around 1975, you see people</p>
<p>struggling with, is this really what computation is?</p>
<p>And so Marvin Minsky, very well known in AI, but also a fantastic mathematician, in his</p>
<p>book Finite and Infant Machines from the mid-&rsquo;60s, which is a beautiful, beautiful mathematical</p>
<p>book, says at the start of the book, well, what is computation?</p>
<p>Turing says it&rsquo;s this, and yeah, I sort of think it&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter whether the stuff&rsquo;s made of wood or plastic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that relatively cheap stuff can do this stuff.</p>
<p>And so yeah, seems like computation.</p>
<p>And Donald Knuth, in his first volume of his Art of Computer Programming in around 1968,</p>
<p>says, well, what&rsquo;s computation?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this stuff, like Turing says, that a person could do each step without too much</p>
<p>trouble.</p>
<p>And so one of his examples of what would be too much trouble was a step which required</p>
<p>knowing whether Fermat&rsquo;s Last Theorem was true or not, because it was not known at the</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s too much trouble for a person to do as a step.</p>
<p>And Hopcroft and Ullman sort of said a similar thing later that year.</p>
<p>And by 1975, in the A.H.O.</p>
<p>Hopcroft and Ullman book, they&rsquo;re saying, well, you know, we don&rsquo;t really know what</p>
<p>computation is, but intuition says this is sort of about right, and this is what it is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s computation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sort of agreed upon thing which happens to be really easy to implement in silicon.</p>
<p>And then we had Moore&rsquo;s Law, which took off, and it&rsquo;s been an incredibly powerful tool.</p>
<p>I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t argue with that.</p>
<p>The version we have of computation, incredibly powerful.</p>
<p>Can we just take a pause?</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re talking about is there&rsquo;s an infinite tape with some simple rules of how</p>
<p>to write on that tape, and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re kind of thinking about.</p>
<p>This is computation.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s modeled after humans, how humans do stuff.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s, Turing says in the 36th paper, one of the critical facts here is that</p>
<p>a human has a limited amount of memory.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to put onto our mechanical computers.</p>
<p>So, you know, I&rsquo;m like mass.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like mass or charge or, you know, it&rsquo;s not given by the universe.</p>
<p>It was, this is what we&rsquo;re going to call computation.</p>
<p>And then it has this really, you know, it had this really good implementation, which</p>
<p>has completely changed our technological world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s computation.</p>
<p>Second part of the book, or argument in the book, I have this two by two matrix with science.</p>
<p>In the top row, engineering in the bottom row, left column is intelligence, right column</p>
<p>is life.</p>
<p>So in the bottom row, the engineering, there&rsquo;s artificial intelligence and artificial life.</p>
<p>In the top row, there&rsquo;s neuroscience and abiogenesis.</p>
<p>How does living matter turn in?</p>
<p>How does nonliving matter become living matter?</p>
<p>Four disciplines.</p>
<p>These four disciplines all came into the current form in the period 1945 to 1965.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>There was neuroscience before, but it wasn&rsquo;t effective neuroscience.</p>
<p>It was, you know, there were these ganglia and there&rsquo;s electrical charges, but no one</p>
<p>knows what to do with it.</p>
<p>And furthermore, there are a lot of players who are common across them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve identified common players except for artificial intelligence and abiogenesis.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have, but for any other pair, I can point to people who work them.</p>
<p>And a whole bunch of them, by the way, were at the research lab for electronics at MIT</p>
<p>where Warren McCulloch held forth.</p>
<p>In fact, McCulloch, Pitts, Letvin, and Maturana wrote the first paper on functional neuroscience</p>
<p>called What the Frog&rsquo;s Eye Tells the Frog&rsquo;s Brain, where instead of it just being this</p>
<p>bunch of nerves, they sort of showed what different anatomical components were doing</p>
<p>and telling other anatomical components and, you know, generating behavior in the frog.</p>
<p>Would you put them as basically the fathers or one of the early pioneers of what are now</p>
<p>called artificial neural networks?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, McCulloch and Pitts.</p>
<p>Pitts was a much younger than him.</p>
<p>In 1943, had written a paper inspired by Bertrand Russell on a calculus for the ideas eminent</p>
<p>in neural systems where they had tried to, without any real proof, they had tried to</p>
<p>give a formalism for neurons basically in terms of logic and gates or gates and not</p>
<p>gates with no real evidence that that was what was going on, but they talked about it</p>
<p>and that was picked up by Minsky for his 1953 dissertation on, which was a neural</p>
<p>network, we call it today.</p>
<p>It was picked up by John von Neumann when he was designing the Edbeck computer in 1945.</p>
<p>He talked about its components being neurons based on, and in references, he&rsquo;s only got</p>
<p>three references and one of them is the McCulloch Pitts paper.</p>
<p>So all these people and then the AI people and the artificial life people, which was</p>
<p>John von Neumann originally, there&rsquo;s like overlap between all, they&rsquo;re all going around</p>
<p>the same time.</p>
<p>And three of these four disciplines turned to computation as their primary metaphor.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve got a couple of chapters in the book.</p>
<p>One is titled, wait, computers are people?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s where our computers came from.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, you know, from people who were computing stuff.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ve got another chapter, wait, people are computers?</p>
<p>Which is about computational neuroscience.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this whole circle here.</p>
<p>And that computation is it.</p>
<p>And, you know, I have talked to people about, well, maybe it&rsquo;s not computation that goes</p>
<p>on in the head.</p>
<p>Of course it is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, well, when Elon Musk&rsquo;s rocket goes up, is it computing?</p>
<p>Is that how it gets into orbit?</p>
<p>By computing?</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve got this idea, if you want to build an AI system, you write a computer program.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the word computation very quickly starts doing a lot of work that it was not</p>
<p>initially intended to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the second and same if you talk about the universe as essentially performing a</p>
<p>computation.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Wolfram does this.</p>
<p>He turns it into computation.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t turn rockets into computation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>By the way, when you say computation in our conversation, do you tend to think of computation</p>
<p>narrowly in the way Turing thought of computation?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotten very, you know, squishy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Squishy.</p>
<p>But computation in the way Turing thinks about it and the way most people think about it</p>
<p>actually fits very well with thinking like a hunter gatherer.</p>
<p>There are places and there can be stuff in places and the stuff in places can change</p>
<p>and it stays there until someone changes it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this metaphor of place and container, which, you know, is a combination of our place</p>
<p>cells in our hippocampus and our cortex.</p>
<p>But this is how we use metaphors for mostly to think about.</p>
<p>And when we get outside of our metaphor range, we have to invent tools which we can sort</p>
<p>of switch on to use.</p>
<p>So calculus is an example of a tool.</p>
<p>It can do stuff that our raw reasoning can&rsquo;t do, and we&rsquo;ve got conventions of when you</p>
<p>can use it or not.</p>
<p>But sometimes, you know, people try to all the time, we always try to get physical metaphors</p>
<p>for things, which is why quantum mechanics has been such a problem for a hundred years.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a particle.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a wave.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got to be something we understand.</p>
<p>And I say, no, it&rsquo;s some weird mathematical logic that&rsquo;s different from those, but we</p>
<p>want that metaphor.</p>
<p>Well, you know, I suspect that, you know, a hundred years or 200 years from now, neither</p>
<p>quantum mechanics nor dark matter will be talked about in the same terms, you know,</p>
<p>in the same way that Flogerson&rsquo;s theory eventually went away.</p>
<p>Because it just wasn&rsquo;t an adequate explanatory metaphor, you know.</p>
<p>That metaphor was the stuff, there is stuff in the burning, the burning is in the matter.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the burning was outside the matter, it was the oxygen.</p>
<p>So our desire for metaphor and combined with our limited cognitive capabilities gets us</p>
<p>into trouble.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my argument in this book.</p>
<p>Now, and people say, well, what is it then?</p>
<p>And I say, well, I wish I knew that, right, the book about that.</p>
<p>But I, you know, I give some ideas.</p>
<p>But so there&rsquo;s the three things.</p>
<p>Computation is sort of a particular thing we use.</p>
<p>Oh, can I tell you one beautiful thing, one beautiful thing I found?</p>
<p>So, you know, I used an example of a thing that&rsquo;s different from computation.</p>
<p>You hit a drum and it vibrates, and there are some stationary points on the drum surface,</p>
<p>you know, because the waves are going up and down the stationary points.</p>
<p>Now, you could compute them to arbitrary precision, but the drum just knows them.</p>
<p>The drum doesn&rsquo;t have to compute.</p>
<p>What was the very first computer program ever written by Ada Lovelace?</p>
<p>To compute Bernoulli numbers, and the Bernoulli numbers are exactly what you need to find those</p>
<p>stable points in the drum surface.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And there was a bug in the program.</p>
<p>The arguments to divide were, I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The arguments to divide were reversed in one place.</p>
<p>And it still worked?</p>
<p>Well, no, she&rsquo;s never got to run it.</p>
<p>They never built the analytical engine.</p>
<p>She wrote the program without it, you know.</p>
<p>So the computation?</p>
<p>Computation is sort of, you know, a thing that&rsquo;s become dominant as a metaphor, but</p>
<p>is it the right metaphor?</p>
<p>All three of these four fields adopted computation.</p>
<p>And, you know, a lot of it swirls around Warren McCulloch and all his students, and he funded</p>
<p>a lot of people.</p>
<p>And our human metaphors, our limitations to human thinking, all play into this.</p>
<p>Those are the three themes of the book.</p>
<p>So I have a little to say about computation.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying that there is a gap between the computer or the machine that performs</p>
<p>computation and this machine that appears to have consciousness and intelligence.</p>
<p>Yeah, that piece of meat in your head.</p>
<p>Piece of meat.</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s not just the meat in your head, it&rsquo;s the rest of you too.</p>
<p>I mean, you actually have a neural system in your gut.</p>
<p>I tend to also believe, not believe, but we&rsquo;re now dancing around things we don&rsquo;t know, but</p>
<p>I tend to believe other humans are important.</p>
<p>Like, so we&rsquo;re almost like, I just don&rsquo;t think we would ever have achieved the level</p>
<p>of intelligence we have with other humans.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying so confidently, but I have an intuition that some of the intelligence</p>
<p>is in the interaction.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think it seems to be very likely, again, this is speculation, but we, our species,</p>
<p>and probably neanderthals to some extent, because you can find old bones where they</p>
<p>seem to be counting on them by putting notches that were neanderthals, we are able to put</p>
<p>some of our stuff outside our body into the world.</p>
<p>And then other people can share it.</p>
<p>And then we get these tools that become shared tools.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a whole coupling that would not occur in the single deep learning network,</p>
<p>which was fed all of literature or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, the neural network can&rsquo;t step outside of itself.</p>
<p>But is there some, can we explore this dark room a little bit and try to get at something?</p>
<p>What is the magic?</p>
<p>Where does the magic come from in the human brain that creates the mind?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense as scientists that try to understand it and try to build it?</p>
<p>What are the directions it followed might be productive?</p>
<p>Is it creative, interactive robots?</p>
<p>Is it creating large deep neural networks that do like self supervised learning and</p>
<p>just like we&rsquo;ll discover that when you make something large enough, some interesting things</p>
<p>will emerge?</p>
<p>Is it through physics and chemistry, biology, like artificial life angle?</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;ll sneak up in this four quadrant matrix that you mentioned.</p>
<p>Is there anything you&rsquo;re most, if you had to bet all your money, financial?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So every intelligence we know, animal intelligence, dog intelligence,</p>
<p>octopus intelligence, which is a very different sort of architecture from us.</p>
<p>All the intelligences we know perceive the world in some way and then have action in</p>
<p>the world, but they&rsquo;re able to perceive objects in a way which is actually pretty damn phenomenal</p>
<p>and surprising.</p>
<p>We tend to think that the box over here between us, which is a sound box, I think is a blue</p>
<p>box, but blueness is something that we construct with color constancy.</p>
<p>The blueness is not a direct function of the photons we&rsquo;re receiving.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually context, which is why you can turn, maybe seeing the examples where someone</p>
<p>turns a stop sign into some other sort of sign by just putting a couple of marks on</p>
<p>them and the deep learning system gets it wrong.</p>
<p>And everyone says, but the stop sign&rsquo;s red.</p>
<p>Why is it thinking it&rsquo;s the other sort of sign?</p>
<p>Because redness is not intrinsic in just the photons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a construction of an understanding of the whole world and the relationship between</p>
<p>objects to get color constancy.</p>
<p>But our tendency, in order that we get an archive paper really quickly, is you just</p>
<p>show a lot of data and give the labels and hope it figures it out.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not figuring it out in the same way we do.</p>
<p>We have a very complex perceptual understanding of the world.</p>
<p>Dogs have a very different perceptual understanding based on smell.</p>
<p>They go smell a post, they can tell how many different dogs have visited it in the last</p>
<p>10 hours and how long ago.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all sorts of stuff that we just don&rsquo;t perceive about the world.</p>
<p>And just taking a single snapshot is not perceiving about the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not seeing the registration between us and the object.</p>
<p>And registration is a philosophical concept.</p>
<p>Brian Cantwell Smith talks about it a lot.</p>
<p>Very difficult, squirmy thing to understand.</p>
<p>But I think none of our systems do that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve always talked in AI about the symbol grounding problem, how our symbols that we</p>
<p>talk about are grounded in the world.</p>
<p>And when deep learning came along and started labeling images, people said, ah, the grounding</p>
<p>problem has been solved.</p>
<p>No, the labeling problem was solved with some percentage accuracy, which is different from</p>
<p>the grounding problem.</p>
<p>So you agree with Hans Marvick and what&rsquo;s called the Marvick&rsquo;s paradox that highlights</p>
<p>this counterintuitive notion that reasoning is easy, but perception and mobility are hard.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We shared an office when I was working on computer vision and he was working on his</p>
<p>first mobile robot.</p>
<p>What were those conversations like?</p>
<p>They were great.</p>
<p>So do you still kind of, maybe you can elaborate, do you still believe this kind of notion that</p>
<p>perception is really hard?</p>
<p>Like, can you make sense of why we humans have this poor intuition about what&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>and not?</p>
<p>Well, let me give us sort of another story.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>If you go back to the original teams working on AI from the late 50s into the 60s, and</p>
<p>you go to the AI lab at MIT, who was it that was doing that?</p>
<p>It was a bunch of really smart kids who got into MIT and they were intelligent.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s intelligence about?</p>
<p>Well, the stuff they were good at, playing chess, doing integrals, that was hard stuff.</p>
<p>But, you know, a baby could see stuff, that wasn&rsquo;t intelligent, anyone could do that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not intelligence.</p>
<p>And so, you know, there was this intuition that the hard stuff is the things they were</p>
<p>good at and the easy stuff was the stuff that everyone could do.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And maybe I&rsquo;m overplaying it a little bit, but I think there&rsquo;s an element of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know how much truth there is to, like chess, for example, was</p>
<p>for the longest time seen as the highest level of intellect, right?</p>
<p>Until we got computers that were better at it than people.</p>
<p>And then we realized, you know, if you go back to the 90s, you&rsquo;ll see, you know, the</p>
<p>stories in the press around when Kasparov was beaten by Deep Blue.</p>
<p>Oh, this is the end of all sorts of things.</p>
<p>Computers are going to be able to do anything from now on.</p>
<p>And we saw exactly the same stories with Alpha Zero, the Go Playing program.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But still, to me, reasoning is a special thing.</p>
<p>And perhaps&hellip;</p>
<p>No, actually, we&rsquo;re really bad at reasoning.</p>
<p>We just use these analogies based on our hunter gatherer intuitions.</p>
<p>But why is that not, don&rsquo;t you think the ability to construct metaphor is a really powerful</p>
<p>thing?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, it is.</p>
<p>Tell stories.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the constructing the metaphor and registering that something constant in our brains.</p>
<p>Like, isn&rsquo;t that what we&rsquo;re doing with vision too?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re telling our stories.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re constructing good models of the world.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But I think we jumped between what we&rsquo;re capable of and how we&rsquo;re doing it right there.</p>
<p>It was a little confusion that went on as we were telling each other stories.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Trying to delude each other.</p>
<p>No, I just think I&rsquo;m not exactly so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to pull apart this Moravec&rsquo;s paradox.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t view it as a paradox.</p>
<p>What did evolution spend its time on?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It spent its time on getting us to perceive and move in the world.</p>
<p>That was 600 million years as multi cell creatures doing that.</p>
<p>And then it was relatively recent that we were able to hunt or gather or even animals hunting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s much more recent.</p>
<p>And then anything that we, speech, language, those things are a couple of hundred thousand</p>
<p>years probably, if that long.</p>
<p>And then agriculture, 10,000 years.</p>
<p>All that stuff was built on top of those earlier things, which took a long time to develop.</p>
<p>So if you then look at the engineering of these things, so building it into robots,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the hardest part of robotics?</p>
<p>Do you think as the decades that you worked on robots in the context of what we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about, vision, perception, the actual sort of the biomechanics of movement, I&rsquo;m kind</p>
<p>of drawing parallels here between humans and machines always.</p>
<p>Like what do you think is the hardest part of robotics?</p>
<p>I just want to think all of them.</p>
<p>There are no easy parts to do well.</p>
<p>We sort of go reductionist and we reduce it.</p>
<p>If only we had all the location of all the points in 3D, things would be great.</p>
<p>If only we had labels on the images, things would be great.</p>
<p>But as we see, that&rsquo;s not good enough.</p>
<p>Some deeper understanding.</p>
<p>But if I came to you and I could solve one category of problems in robotics instantly,</p>
<p>what would give you the greatest pleasure?</p>
<p>I mean, you look at robots that manipulate objects, what&rsquo;s hard about that?</p>
<p>You know, is it the perception, is it the reasoning about the world, that common sense</p>
<p>reasoning, is it the actual building a robot that&rsquo;s able to interact with the world?</p>
<p>Is it like human aspects of a robot that&rsquo;s interacting with humans in that game theory</p>
<p>of how they work well together?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s talk about manipulation for a second because I had this really blinding</p>
<p>moment, you know, I&rsquo;m a grandfather, so grandfathers have blinding moments.</p>
<p>Just three or four miles from here, last year, my 16 month old grandson was in his new house</p>
<p>for the first time, right?</p>
<p>First time in this house.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d never been able to get to a window before, but this had some low windows.</p>
<p>And he goes up to this window with a handle on it that he&rsquo;s never seen before.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s got one hand pushing the window and the other hand turning the handle to open</p>
<p>the window.</p>
<p>He knew two different hands, two different things he knew how to put together.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s 16 months old.</p>
<p>And there you are watching in awe.</p>
<p>In an environment he&rsquo;d never seen before, a mechanism he&rsquo;d never seen.</p>
<p>How did he do that?</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>How did he do that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, like you could see the leap of genius from using one hand to perform a</p>
<p>task to combining, doing, I mean, first of all, in manipulation, that&rsquo;s really difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like two hands, both necessary to complete the action.</p>
<p>And completely different.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d never seen a window open before, but he inferred somehow handle open something.</p>
<p>Yeah, there may have been a lot of slightly different failure cases that you didn&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>Not with a window, but with other objects of turning and twisting and handles.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great counter to reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll just give the robot plenty of time to try everything.</p>
<p>Can I tell a little side story here?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;m in DeepMind in London, this is three, four years ago, where there&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>Google building, and then you go inside and you go through this more security, and then</p>
<p>you get to DeepMind where the other Google employees can&rsquo;t go.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m in a conference room, a conference room with some of the people, and they tell</p>
<p>me about their reinforcement learning experiment with robots, which are just trying stuff out.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re my robots.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re Sawyer&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>We sold them.</p>
<p>And they really like them because Sawyer&rsquo;s are compliant and can sense forces, so they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t break when they&rsquo;re bashing into walls.</p>
<p>They stop and they do all this stuff.</p>
<p>So you just let the robot do stuff, and eventually it figures stuff out.</p>
<p>By the way, Sawyer, we&rsquo;re talking about robot manipulation, so robot arms and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah, Sawyer&rsquo;s a robot.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Sawyer?</p>
<p>Sawyer&rsquo;s a robot arm that my company Rethink Robotics built.</p>
<p>Thank you for the context.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re in DeepMind.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s in the next room, these robots are just bashing around to try and use reinforcement</p>
<p>learning to learn how to act.</p>
<p>Can I go see them?</p>
<p>Oh no, they&rsquo;re secret.</p>
<p>They were my robots.</p>
<p>They were secret.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is, you know, this idea that you just let reinforcement learning figure</p>
<p>everything out is so counter to how a kid does stuff.</p>
<p>So again, story about my grandson.</p>
<p>I gave him this box that had lots of different lock mechanisms.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t randomly, you know, and he was 18 months old, he didn&rsquo;t randomly try to touch</p>
<p>every surface or push everything.</p>
<p>He found he could see where the mechanism was, and he started exploring the mechanism</p>
<p>for each of these different lock mechanisms.</p>
<p>And there was reinforcement, no doubt, of some sort going on there.</p>
<p>But he applied a pre filter, which cut down the search space dramatically.</p>
<p>I wonder to what level we&rsquo;re able to introspect what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Because what&rsquo;s also possible is you have something like reinforcement learning going</p>
<p>on in the mind in the space of imagination.</p>
<p>So like you have a good model of the world you&rsquo;re predicting and you may be running those</p>
<p>tens of thousands of like loops, but you&rsquo;re like, as a human, you&rsquo;re just looking at yourself</p>
<p>trying to tell a story of what happened.</p>
<p>And it might seem simple, but maybe there&rsquo;s a lot of computation going on.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, but there&rsquo;s also a mechanism that&rsquo;s being built up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just random search.</p>
<p>Yeah, that mechanism prunes it dramatically.</p>
<p>Yeah, that pruning, that pruning stuff, but it doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s possible that that&rsquo;s, so</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s akin to a neural network inside a reinforcement learning algorithm.</p>
<p>Is it possible?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, yeah, until it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible, but I&rsquo;ll be incredibly surprised if that happens.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also be incredibly surprised that after all the decades that I&rsquo;ve been doing this,</p>
<p>where every few years someone thinks, now we&rsquo;ve got it.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve got it.</p>
<p>Four or five years ago, I was saying, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve got it yet.</p>
<p>And everyone was saying, you don&rsquo;t understand how powerful AI is.</p>
<p>I had people tell me, you don&rsquo;t understand how powerful it is.</p>
<p>I sort of had a track record of what the world had done to think, well, this is no different</p>
<p>from before.</p>
<p>Or we have bigger computers.</p>
<p>We had bigger computers in the 90s and we could do more stuff.</p>
<p>But okay, so let me push back because I&rsquo;m generally sort of optimistic and try to find</p>
<p>the beauty in things.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of surprising and beautiful things that neural networks, this new generation</p>
<p>of deep learning revolution has revealed to me, has continually been very surprising</p>
<p>the kind of things it&rsquo;s able to do.</p>
<p>Now, generalizing that over saying like this, we&rsquo;ve solved intelligence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another big leap.</p>
<p>But is there something surprising and beautiful to you about neural networks that were actually</p>
<p>you said back and said, I did not expect this?</p>
<p>Oh, I think their performance on ImageNet was shocking.</p>
<p>The computer vision in those early days was just very like, wow, okay.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that they&rsquo;re solving everything in computer vision we need to solve or in</p>
<p>vision for robots.</p>
<p>What about AlphaZero and self play mechanisms and reinforcement learning?</p>
<p>Yeah, that was all in the 90s.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was all in Donald Mickey&rsquo;s 1961 paper.</p>
<p>Everything that was there, which introduced reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>No, but come on.</p>
<p>So no, you&rsquo;re talking about the actual techniques.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t it surprising to you the level it&rsquo;s able to achieve with no human supervision</p>
<p>of chess play?</p>
<p>Like, to me, there&rsquo;s a big, big difference between Deep Blue and&hellip;</p>
<p>Maybe what that&rsquo;s saying is how overblown our view of ourselves is.</p>
<p>You know, the chess is easy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I came across this 1946 report that, and I&rsquo;d seen this as a kid in one of</p>
<p>those books that my mother had given me actually.</p>
<p>The 1946 report, which pitted someone with an abacus against an electronic calculator,</p>
<p>and he beat the electronic calculator.</p>
<p>You know, so there at that point was, well, humans are still better than machines at calculating.</p>
<p>Are you surprised today that a machine can, you know, do a billion floating point operations</p>
<p>a second and, you know, you&rsquo;re puzzling for minutes through one?</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, but I am certainly surprised there&rsquo;s something, to me, different about</p>
<p>learning, so a system that&rsquo;s able to learn.</p>
<p>Learning.</p>
<p>See, now you&rsquo;re getting into one of the deadly sins.</p>
<p>Because of using terms overly broadly.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s so many different forms of learning.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So many different forms.</p>
<p>You know, I learned my way around the city.</p>
<p>I learned to play chess.</p>
<p>I learned Latin.</p>
<p>I learned to ride a bicycle.</p>
<p>All of those are, you know, very different capabilities.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And if someone, you know, has a, you know, in the old days, people would write a paper</p>
<p>about learning something.</p>
<p>Now the corporate press office puts out a press release about how Company X is leading</p>
<p>the world because they have a system that can&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, but here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So what is learning?</p>
<p>When I refer to&hellip;</p>
<p>Learning is many things.</p>
<p>But&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a suitcase word.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a suitcase word, but loosely, there&rsquo;s a dumb system, and over time, it becomes smart.</p>
<p>Well, it becomes less dumb at the thing that it&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>Smart is a loaded word.</p>
<p>Yes, less dumb at the thing it&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>It gets better performance under some measure, under some set of conditions at that thing.</p>
<p>And most of these learning algorithms, learning systems, fail when you change the conditions</p>
<p>just a little bit in a way that humans don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So I was at DeepMind, the AlphaGo had just come out, and I said, what would have happened</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d given it a 21 by 21 board instead of a 19 by 19 board?</p>
<p>They said, fail totally.</p>
<p>But a human player would actually be able to play.</p>
<p>And actually, funny enough, if you look at DeepMind&rsquo;s work since then, they&rsquo;re presenting</p>
<p>a lot of algorithms that would do well at the bigger board.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re slowly expanding this generalization.</p>
<p>I mean, to me, there&rsquo;s a core element there.</p>
<p>I think it is very surprising to me that even in a constrained game of chess or Go, that</p>
<p>through self play, by a system playing itself, that it can achieve superhuman level performance</p>
<p>through learning alone.</p>
<p>Okay, so you didn&rsquo;t like it when I referred to Donald Mickey&rsquo;s 1961 paper.</p>
<p>There, in the second part of it, which came a year later, they had self play on an electronic</p>
<p>computer at tic tac toe, okay, but it learned to play tic tac toe through self play.</p>
<p>And it learned to play optimally.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is, okay, I have a little bit of a bias, but I find ideas beautiful,</p>
<p>but only when they actually realize the promise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another level of beauty.</p>
<p>For example, what Bezos and Elon Musk are doing with rockets.</p>
<p>We had rockets for a long time, but doing reusable cheap rockets, it&rsquo;s very impressive.</p>
<p>In the same way, I would have not predicted.</p>
<p>First of all, when I started and fell in love with AI, the game of Go was seen to be impossible</p>
<p>to solve.</p>
<p>Okay, so I thought maybe, you know, maybe it&rsquo;d be possible to maybe have big leaps in</p>
<p>a Moore&rsquo;s law style of way, in computation, I&rsquo;ll be able to solve it.</p>
<p>But I would never have guessed that you can learn your way, however, I mean, in the narrow</p>
<p>sense of learning, learn your way to beat the best people in the world at the game of</p>
<p>Go without human supervision, not studying the game of experts.</p>
<p>Okay, so using a different learning technique, Arthur Samuel in the early 60s, and he was</p>
<p>the first person to use machine learning, had a program that could beat the world champion</p>
<p>at checkers.</p>
<p>And that at the time was considered amazing.</p>
<p>By the way, Arthur Samuel had some fantastic advantages.</p>
<p>Do you want to hear Arthur Samuel&rsquo;s advantages?</p>
<p>Two things.</p>
<p>One, he was at the 1956 AI conference.</p>
<p>I knew Arthur later in life.</p>
<p>He was at Stanford when I was a graduate student there.</p>
<p>He wore a tie and a jacket every day, the rest of us didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Delightful man, delightful man.</p>
<p>It turns out Claude Shannon, in a 1950 Scientific American article, on chess playing, outlined</p>
<p>the learning mechanism that Arthur Samuel used, and they had met in 1956.</p>
<p>I assume there was some communication, but I don&rsquo;t know that for sure.</p>
<p>But Arthur Samuel had been a vacuum tube engineer, getting reliability of vacuum tubes, and then</p>
<p>had overseen the first transistorized computers at IBM.</p>
<p>And in those days, before you shipped a computer, you ran it for a week to get early failures.</p>
<p>So he had this whole farm of computers running random code for hours and hours for each computer.</p>
<p>He had a whole bunch of them.</p>
<p>So he ran his chess learning program with self play on IBM&rsquo;s production line.</p>
<p>He had more computation available to him than anyone else in the world, and then he was</p>
<p>able to produce a chess playing program, I mean a checkers playing program, that could</p>
<p>beat the world champion.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>The question is, what I mean surprised, I don&rsquo;t just mean it&rsquo;s nice to have that accomplishment,</p>
<p>is there is a stepping towards something that feels more intelligent than before.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s in your view of the world.</p>
<p>Okay, well let me then, it doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>No, no it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So the question is, if we keep taking steps like that, how far that takes us?</p>
<p>Are we going to build a better recommender systems?</p>
<p>Are we going to build a better robot?</p>
<p>Or will we solve intelligence?</p>
<p>So, you know, I&rsquo;m putting my bet on, but still missing a whole lot.</p>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>And why would I say that?</p>
<p>Well, in these games, they&rsquo;re all, you know, 100% information games, but again, but each</p>
<p>of these systems is a very short description of the current state, which is different from</p>
<p>registering and perception in the world, which gets back to Marovec&rsquo;s paradox.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m definitely not saying that chess is somehow harder than perception or any kind of, even</p>
<p>any kind of robotics in the physical world, I definitely think is way harder than the</p>
<p>game of chess.</p>
<p>So I was always much more impressed by the workings of the human mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>The human mind is incredible.</p>
<p>I believe that from the very beginning, I wanted to be a psychiatrist for the longest</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>I always thought that&rsquo;s way more incredible in the game of chess.</p>
<p>I think the game of chess is, I love the Olympics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just another example of us humans picking a task and then agreeing that a million humans</p>
<p>will dedicate their whole life to that task.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the cool thing that the human mind is able to focus on one task and then compete</p>
<p>against each other and achieve like weirdly incredible levels of performance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the aspect of chess that&rsquo;s super cool.</p>
<p>Not that chess in itself is really difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Fermat&rsquo;s last theorem is not in itself to me that interesting.</p>
<p>The fact that thousands of people have been struggling to solve that particular problem</p>
<p>is fascinating.</p>
<p>So can I tell you my disease in this way?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Which actually is closer to what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>So as a child, I was building various, I called them computers.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t general purpose computers.</p>
<p>Ice cube tray.</p>
<p>The ice cube tray was one.</p>
<p>But I built other machines.</p>
<p>And what I liked to build was machines that could beat adults at a game and the adults</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t beat my machine.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you were like, that&rsquo;s powerful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a way to rebel.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, when was the first time you built something that outperformed you?</p>
<p>Do you remember?</p>
<p>Well, I knew how it worked.</p>
<p>I was probably nine years old and I built a thing that was a game where you take turns</p>
<p>in taking matches from a pile and either the one who takes the last one or the one who</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t take the last one wins.</p>
<p>I forget.</p>
<p>And so it was pretty easy to build that out of wires and nails and little coils that were</p>
<p>like plugging in the number and a few light bulbs.</p>
<p>The one I was proud of, I was 12 when I built a thing out of old telephone switchboard switches</p>
<p>that could always win at tic tac toe.</p>
<p>And that was a much harder circuit to design.</p>
<p>But again, it was no active components.</p>
<p>It was just three position switches, empty, X, zero, O.</p>
<p>And nine of them and a light bulb on which move it wanted next.</p>
<p>And then the human would go and move that.</p>
<p>See, there&rsquo;s magic in that creation.</p>
<p>There was.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I tend to see magic in robots that like I also think that intelligence is a little bit</p>
<p>overrated.</p>
<p>I think we can have deep connections with robots very soon.</p>
<p>And well, we&rsquo;ll come back to connections for sure.</p>
<p>But I do want to say, I think too many people make the mistake of seeing that magic and</p>
<p>thinking, well, we&rsquo;ll just continue.</p>
<p>But each one of those is a hard fought battle for the next step, the next step.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The open question here is, and this is why I&rsquo;m playing devil&rsquo;s advocate, but I often</p>
<p>do when I read your blog post in my mind because I have like this eternal optimism, is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not clear to me.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t do what obviously the journalists do or they give into the hype, but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>obvious to me how many steps away we are from a truly transformational understanding of</p>
<p>what it means to build intelligent systems or how to build intelligent systems.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also aware of the whole history of artificial intelligence, which is where your deep grounding</p>
<p>of this is, is there has been an optimism for decades and that optimism, just like reading</p>
<p>old optimism is absurd because people were like, this is, they were saying things are</p>
<p>trivial for decades since the sixties, they&rsquo;re saying everything is true.</p>
<p>Computer vision is trivial, but I think my mind is working crisply enough to where, I</p>
<p>mean, we can dig into if you want.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really surprised by the things DeepMind has done.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re so, they&rsquo;re yet close to solving intelligence, but I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not 10 to 10 years away.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m referring to is interesting to see when the engineering, it takes that idea to</p>
<p>scale and the idea works.</p>
<p>And no, it fools people.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Honestly, Rodney, if it was you, me and Demis inside a room, forget the press, forget all</p>
<p>those things, just as a scientist, as a roboticist, that wasn&rsquo;t surprising to you that at scale.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about very large now, okay, let&rsquo;s pick one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most surprising to you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t yell at me.</p>
<p>GPT three, okay.</p>
<p>Hold on, hold on, I was going to say, okay, alpha zero, alpha go, alpha go, zero, alpha</p>
<p>zero, and then alpha fold one and two.</p>
<p>So do any of these kind of have this core of, forget usefulness or application and so</p>
<p>on, which you could argue for alpha fold, like, as a scientist, was those surprising</p>
<p>to you that it worked as well as it did?</p>
<p>Okay, so if we&rsquo;re going to make the distinction between surprise and usefulness, and I have</p>
<p>to explain this, I would say alpha fold, and one of the problems at the moment with alpha</p>
<p>fold is, you know, it gets a lot of them right, which is a surprise to me, because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a really complex thing, but you don&rsquo;t know which ones it gets right, which then is a</p>
<p>bit of a problem.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;ve come out with a recent&hellip;</p>
<p>You mean the structure of the proteins, it gets a lot of those right.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a surprising number of them right, it&rsquo;s been a really hard problem.</p>
<p>So that was a surprise how many it gets right.</p>
<p>So far, the usefulness is limited, because you don&rsquo;t know which ones are right or not,</p>
<p>and now they&rsquo;ve come out with a thing in the last few weeks, which is trying to get a useful</p>
<p>tool out of it, and they may well do it.</p>
<p>In that sense, at least alpha fold is different, because your alpha fold tool is different,</p>
<p>because now it&rsquo;s producing data sets that are actually, you know, potentially revolutionizing</p>
<p>competition biology, like they will actually help a lot of people, but&hellip;</p>
<p>You would say potentially revolutionizing, we don&rsquo;t know yet, but yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, yeah.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re, you know, but I got you.</p>
<p>I mean, this is&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay, so you know what, this is gonna be so fun, so let&rsquo;s go right into it.</p>
<p>Speaking of robots that operate in the real world, let&rsquo;s talk about self driving cars.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Okay, because you have built robotics companies, you&rsquo;re one of the greatest roboticists in</p>
<p>history, and that&rsquo;s not just in the space of ideas, we&rsquo;ll also probably talk about that,</p>
<p>but in the actual building and execution of businesses that make robots that are useful</p>
<p>for people and that actually work in the real world and make money.</p>
<p>You also sometimes are critical of Mr. Elon Musk, or let&rsquo;s more specifically focus on</p>
<p>this particular technology, which is autopilot inside Teslas.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about Tesla autopilot, or more generally vision based machine learning</p>
<p>approach to semi autonomous driving?</p>
<p>These are robots, they&rsquo;re being used in the real world by hundreds of thousands of people,</p>
<p>and if you want to go there, I can go there, but that&rsquo;s not too much, which they&rsquo;re&hellip;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say they&rsquo;re on par safety wise as humans currently, meaning human alone versus human</p>
<p>plus robot.</p>
<p>Okay, so first let me say I really like the car I came in here today.</p>
<p>Which is?</p>
<p>2021 model, Mercedes E450.</p>
<p>I am impressed by the machine vision, sonar, other things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m impressed by what it can do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really impressed with many aspects of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s able to stay in lane, is it?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, it does the lane stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s looking on either side of me, it&rsquo;s telling me about nearby cars.</p>
<p>For blind spots and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah, when I&rsquo;m going in close to something in the park, I get this beautiful, gorgeous,</p>
<p>top down view of the world.</p>
<p>I am impressed up the wazoo of how registered and metrical that is.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like multiple cameras and it&rsquo;s all ready to go to produce the 360 view kind of</p>
<p>thing?</p>
<p>360 view, it&rsquo;s synthesized so it&rsquo;s above the car, and it is unbelievable.</p>
<p>I got this car in January, it&rsquo;s the longest I&rsquo;ve ever owned a car without digging it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s better than me.</p>
<p>Me and it together are better.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying technology&rsquo;s bad or not useful, but here&rsquo;s my point.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a replay of the same movie.</p>
<p>Okay, so maybe you&rsquo;ve seen me ask this question before.</p>
<p>But when did the first car go over 55 miles an hour for over 10 miles on a public freeway</p>
<p>with other traffic around driving completely autonomously?</p>
<p>When did that happen?</p>
<p>Was it CMU in the 80s or something?</p>
<p>It was a long time ago.</p>
<p>It was actually in 1987 in Munich at the Bundeswehr.</p>
<p>So they had it running in 1987.</p>
<p>When do you think, and Elon has said he&rsquo;s going to do this, when do you think we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have the first car drive coast to coast in the US, hands off the wheel, feet off the</p>
<p>pedals, coast to coast?</p>
<p>As far as I know, a few people have claimed to do it.</p>
<p>1995, that was Carnegie Mellon.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know, but oh, that was the, they didn&rsquo;t claim, did they claim 100%?</p>
<p>Not 100%, not 100%.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a few marketing people who have claimed 100% since then.</p>
<p>My point is that, you know, what I see happening again is someone sees a demo and they overgeneralize</p>
<p>and say, we must be almost there.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve been working on it for 35 years.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s demos.</p>
<p>But this is going to take us back to the same conversation with AlphaZero.</p>
<p>Are you not, okay, I&rsquo;ll just say what I am because I thought, okay, when I first started</p>
<p>interacting with the Mobileye implementation of Tesla Autopilot, I&rsquo;ve driven a lot of car,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;ve been in Google self driving car since the beginning.</p>
<p>I thought there was no way before I sat and used Mobileye, I thought they&rsquo;re just knowing</p>
<p>computer vision.</p>
<p>I thought there&rsquo;s no way it could work as well as it was working.</p>
<p>So my model of the limits of computer vision was way more limited than the actual implementation</p>
<p>of Mobileye.</p>
<p>I was so that&rsquo;s one example.</p>
<p>I was really surprised.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, wow, that was that was incredible.</p>
<p>The second surprise came when Tesla threw away Mobileye and started from scratch.</p>
<p>I thought there&rsquo;s no way they can catch up to Mobileye.</p>
<p>I thought what Mobileye was doing was kind of incredible, like the amount of work and</p>
<p>the annotation.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, Mobileye was started by Amnon Shashua and used a lot of traditional, you</p>
<p>know, hard fought computer vision techniques.</p>
<p>But they also did a lot of good sort of like non research stuff, like actual like just</p>
<p>good, like what you do to make a successful product, right?</p>
<p>Scale, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And so I was very surprised when they from scratch were able to catch up to that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very impressive.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked to a lot of engineers that was involved.</p>
<p>This is that was impressive.</p>
<p>That was impressive.</p>
<p>And the recent progress, especially under the involvement of Andrej Karpathy, what they</p>
<p>were what they&rsquo;re doing with the data engine, which is converting into the driving task</p>
<p>into these multiple tasks and then doing this edge case discovery when they&rsquo;re pulling back</p>
<p>like the level of engineering made me rethink what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I still, you know, I don&rsquo;t know to that intensity, but I always thought it was</p>
<p>very difficult to solve autonomous driving with all the sensors, with all the computation.</p>
<p>I just thought it&rsquo;s a very difficult problem.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve been continuously surprised how much you can engineer.</p>
<p>First of all, the data acquisition problem, because I thought, you know, just because</p>
<p>I worked with a lot of car companies and they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re so a little a little bit old school</p>
<p>to where I didn&rsquo;t think they could do this at scale like AWS style data collection.</p>
<p>So when Tesla was able to do that, I started to think, OK, so what are the limits of this?</p>
<p>I still believe that driver like sensing and the interaction with the driver and like studying</p>
<p>the human factor psychology problem is essential.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s always going to be there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always going to be there, even with fully autonomous driving.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve been surprised what is the limit, especially a vision based alone, how far that</p>
<p>can take us.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my levels of surprise now.</p>
<p>OK, can you explain in the same way you said, like Alpha Zero, that&rsquo;s a homework problem</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s scaled large in its chest, like who cares?</p>
<p>Go with here&rsquo;s actual people using an actual car and driving.</p>
<p>Many of them drive more than half their miles using the system.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, yeah, they&rsquo;re doing well with with pure vision for your vision.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, you know, and now no radar, which is I suspect that can&rsquo;t go all the way.</p>
<p>And one reason is without without new cameras that have a dynamic range closer to the human</p>
<p>eye, because human eye has incredible dynamic range.</p>
<p>And we make use of that dynamic range in its 11 orders of magnitude or some crazy number</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>The cameras don&rsquo;t have that, which is why you see the the the bad cases where the sun</p>
<p>on a white thing and it blinds it in a way it wouldn&rsquo;t blind the person.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a bunch of things to think about before you say this is so good, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just going to work.</p>
<p>OK, and I&rsquo;ll come at it from multiple angles.</p>
<p>And I know you&rsquo;ve got a lot of time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>OK, let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s I have thought about these things.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been writing a lot of great blog posts about it for a while before Tesla had autopilot.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve been thinking about autonomous driving for a while from every angle.</p>
<p>So so a few things, you know, in the US, I think that the death rate for autonomous driving</p>
<p>death rate from motor vehicle accidents is about thirty five thousand a year,</p>
<p>which is an outrageous number, not outrageous compared to covid deaths.</p>
<p>But, you know, there is no rationality.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of the thing people have said.</p>
<p>Engineers say to me, well, if we cut down the number of deaths by 10 percent by having</p>
<p>autonomous driving, that&rsquo;s going to be great.</p>
<p>Everyone will love it.</p>
<p>And my prediction is that if autonomous vehicles kill more than 10 people a year, they&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>screaming and hollering, even though thirty five thousand people a year have been killed</p>
<p>by human drivers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not rational.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different set of expectations.</p>
<p>And that will probably continue.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that aspect of it.</p>
<p>The other aspect of it is that when we introduce new technology, we often change the rules</p>
<p>of the game.</p>
<p>So when we introduced cars first into our daily lives, we completely rebuilt our cities</p>
<p>and we changed all the laws.</p>
<p>Yeah, jaywalking was not an offense that was pushed by the car companies so that people</p>
<p>would stay off the road so there wouldn&rsquo;t be deaths from pedestrians getting hit.</p>
<p>We completely changed the structure of our cities and had these foul smelling things</p>
<p>everywhere around us.</p>
<p>And now you see pushback in cities like Barcelona is really trying to exclude cars, et cetera.</p>
<p>So I think that to get to self driving, we will, large adoption, it&rsquo;s not going to be</p>
<p>just take the current situation, take out the driver and put the same car doing the</p>
<p>same stuff because the end case is too many.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>How many fully autonomous train systems do we have in the U.S.?</p>
<p>I mean, do you count them as fully autonomous?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know because they&rsquo;re usually as a driver, but they&rsquo;re kind of autonomous, right?</p>
<p>No, let&rsquo;s get rid of the driver.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s either 15 or 16.</p>
<p>Most of them are in airports.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few that are fully autonomous.</p>
<p>Seven are in airports, there&rsquo;s a few that go about five, two that go about five kilometers</p>
<p>out of airports.</p>
<p>When is the first fully autonomous train system for mass transit expected to operate fully</p>
<p>autonomously with no driver in a U.S.</p>
<p>City?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s expected to operate in 2017 in Honolulu.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s delayed, but they will get there.</p>
<p>BART, by the way, was originally going to be autonomous here in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re all very close to fully autonomous, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, but getting that close is the thing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve often gone on a fully autonomous train in Japan, one that goes out to that</p>
<p>fake island in the middle of Tokyo Bay.</p>
<p>I forget the name of that.</p>
<p>And what do you see when you look at that?</p>
<p>What do you see when you go to a fully autonomous train in an airport?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like regular trains.</p>
<p>At every station, there&rsquo;s a double set of doors so that there&rsquo;s a door of the train</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a door off the platform.</p>
<p>And this is really visible in this Japanese one because it goes out in amongst buildings.</p>
<p>The whole track is built so that people can&rsquo;t climb onto it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an engineering that then makes the system safe and makes them acceptable.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll see similar sorts of things happen in the U.S.</p>
<p>What surprised me, I thought, wrongly, that we would have special purpose lanes on 101</p>
<p>in the Bay Area, the leftmost lane, so that it would be normal for Teslas or other cars</p>
<p>to move into that lane and then say, okay, now it&rsquo;s autonomous and have that dedicated lane.</p>
<p>I was expecting movement to that.</p>
<p>Five years ago, I was expecting we&rsquo;d have a lot more movement towards that.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And it may be because Tesla&rsquo;s been overpromising by saying this, calling their system fully</p>
<p>self driving, I think they may have been gotten there quicker by collaborating to change the</p>
<p>infrastructure.</p>
<p>This is one of the problems with long haul trucking being autonomous.</p>
<p>I think it makes sense on freeways at night for the trucks to go autonomously, but then</p>
<p>is that how do you get onto and off of the freeway?</p>
<p>What sort of infrastructure do you need for that?</p>
<p>Do you need to have the human in there to do that or can you get rid of the human?</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s ways to get there, but it&rsquo;s an infrastructure argument because the</p>
<p>long tail of cases is very long and the acceptance of it will not be at the same level as human</p>
<p>drivers.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m with you still, and I was with you for a long time, but I am surprised how well</p>
<p>how many edge cases of machine learning and vision based methods can cover.</p>
<p>This is what I&rsquo;m trying to get at is I think there&rsquo;s something fundamentally different</p>
<p>with vision based methods and Tesla Autopilot and any company that&rsquo;s trying to do the same.</p>
<p>Okay, well, I&rsquo;m not going to argue with you because, you know, we&rsquo;re speculating.</p>
<p>Yes, but, you know, my gut feeling tells me it&rsquo;s going to be things will speed up when</p>
<p>there is engineering of the environment because that&rsquo;s what happened with every other technology.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bit, I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I&rsquo;m a bit cynical that infrastructure is going</p>
<p>to rely on government to help out in these cases.</p>
<p>If you just look at infrastructure in all domains, it&rsquo;s just a government always drags</p>
<p>behind on infrastructure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s so many just well in this country in the future.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Yes, in this country.</p>
<p>And of course, there&rsquo;s many, many countries that are actually much worse on infrastructure.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, many of the much worse and there&rsquo;s some that are much worse.</p>
<p>You know, like high speed rail, the other countries are much better.</p>
<p>I guess my question is, like, which is at the core of what I was trying to think through</p>
<p>here and ask is like, how hard is the driving problem as it currently stands?</p>
<p>So you mentioned, like, we don&rsquo;t want to just take the human out and duplicate whatever</p>
<p>the human was doing.</p>
<p>But if we were to try to do that, what, how hard is that problem?</p>
<p>Because I used to think is way harder.</p>
<p>Like, I used to think it&rsquo;s with vision alone, it would be three decades, four decades.</p>
<p>Okay, so I don&rsquo;t know the answer to this thing I&rsquo;m about to pose, but I do notice that on</p>
<p>Highway 280 here in the Bay Area, which largely has concrete surface rather than blacktop</p>
<p>surface, the white lines that are painted there now have black boundaries around them.</p>
<p>And my lane drift system in my car would not work without those black boundaries.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know whether they started doing it to help the lane drift, whether it is an</p>
<p>instance of infrastructure following the technology, but my car would not perform as well as the</p>
<p>lane, my car would not perform as well without that change in the way they paint the line.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, really good lane keeping is not as valuable.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s orders of magnitude more valuable to have a fully autonomous system.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, but for me, lane keeping is really helpful because I&rsquo;m more healthy at it.</p>
<p>But you wouldn&rsquo;t pay 10 times.</p>
<p>Like, the problem is there&rsquo;s not financial, like, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to revamp the</p>
<p>infrastructure to make lane keeping easier.</p>
<p>It does make sense to revamp the infrastructure.</p>
<p>If you have a large fleet of autonomous vehicles, now you change what it means to own cars,</p>
<p>you change the nature of transportation.</p>
<p>But for that, you need autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about Waymo then.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a bunch of chances to ride in a Waymo self driving car.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;d call them self driving, but.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I rode in one before they were called Waymo when I was still at X.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s currently, there&rsquo;s a big leap, another surprising leap I didn&rsquo;t think would</p>
<p>happen, which is they have no driver currently.</p>
<p>Yeah, in Chandler.</p>
<p>In Chandler, Arizona.</p>
<p>And I think they&rsquo;re thinking of doing that in Austin as well.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re expanding.</p>
<p>Although, you know, and I do an annual checkup on this.</p>
<p>So as of late last year, they were aiming for hundreds of rides a week, not thousands.</p>
<p>And there is no one in the car, but there&rsquo;s certainly safety people in the loop.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not clear how many, you know, what the ratio of cars to safety people is.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t, obviously, they&rsquo;re not 100% transparent about this.</p>
<p>None of them are 100% transparent.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very untransparent.</p>
<p>But at least the way they&rsquo;re, I don&rsquo;t want to make definitively, but they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no teleoperation.</p>
<p>So like, they&rsquo;re, I mean, okay.</p>
<p>And that sort of fits with YouTube videos I&rsquo;ve seen of people being trapped in the car</p>
<p>by a red cone on the street.</p>
<p>And they do have rescue vehicles that come, and then a person gets in and drives it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t it incredible to you, it was to me, to get in a car with no driver and watch</p>
<p>the steering wheel turn, like for somebody who has been studying, at least certainly</p>
<p>the human side of autonomous vehicles for many years, and you&rsquo;ve been doing it for way</p>
<p>longer, like it was incredible to me that this was actually could happen.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if that scale is 100 cars.</p>
<p>This is not a demo.</p>
<p>This is not, this is me as a regular human.</p>
<p>The argument I have is that people make interpolations from that.</p>
<p>Interpolations.</p>
<p>That, you know, it&rsquo;s here, it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s just, you know, we&rsquo;ve solved it.</p>
<p>No, we haven&rsquo;t yet.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s my argument.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to go to, you keep a list of predictions on your amazing blog post.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be fun to go through them.</p>
<p>But before then, let me ask you about this.</p>
<p>You have a harshness to you sometimes in your criticisms of what is perceived as hype.</p>
<p>And so like, because people extrapolate, like you said, and they kind of buy into the hype</p>
<p>and then they kind of start to think that the technology is way better than it is.</p>
<p>But let me ask you maybe a difficult question.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Do you think if you look at history of progress, don&rsquo;t you think to achieve the quote impossible,</p>
<p>you have to believe that it&rsquo;s possible?</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Look, his two great runs, great, unbelievable, 1903, first human power, human, you know,</p>
<p>human, you know, heavier than their flight.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>1969, we land on the moon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 66 years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 66 years old in my lifetime, that span of my lifetime, barely, you know, flying,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it was, 50 feet, the length of the first flight or something to landing</p>
<p>on the moon.</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>But that requires, by the way, one of the Wright brothers, both of them, but one of</p>
<p>them didn&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s even possible like a year before.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, like, not just possible soon, but like ever.</p>
<p>So, you know.</p>
<p>How important is it to believe and be optimistic is what I guess.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, it is important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when it goes crazy, when I, you know, you said that, what was the word you used</p>
<p>for my bad?</p>
<p>Harshness.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I just get so frustrated.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>When people make these leaps and tell me that I&rsquo;m, that I don&rsquo;t understand, you know, yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just from iRobot, which I was co founder of.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the exact numbers now because I haven&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s 10 years since I stepped</p>
<p>off the board, but I believe it&rsquo;s well over 30 million robots cleaning houses from that</p>
<p>one company.</p>
<p>And now there&rsquo;s lots of other companies.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Was that a crazy idea that we had to believe in 2002 when we released it?</p>
<p>Yeah, that was, we had, we had to, you know, believe that it could be done.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about this.</p>
<p>So iRobot, one of the greatest robotics companies ever in terms of creating a robot that actually</p>
<p>works in the real world, probably the greatest robotics company ever.</p>
<p>You were the co founder of it.</p>
<p>If, if the Rodney Brooks of today talked to the Rodney of back then, what would you tell</p>
<p>him?</p>
<p>Cause I have a sense that would you pat him on the back and say, well, you&rsquo;re doing is</p>
<p>going to fail, but go at it anyway.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m referring to with the harshness.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve accomplished an incredible thing there.</p>
<p>One of the several things we&rsquo;ll talk about was, you know, you know, you know, you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done several things we&rsquo;ll talk about.</p>
<p>Well, like that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to get at that line.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s when my harshness is reserved for people who are not doing it, who claim</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, well, this shows that it&rsquo;s just going to happen.</p>
<p>But here, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>This shows.</p>
<p>But you have that harshness for Elon too.</p>
<p>And no, no, it&rsquo;s a different harshness.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a different argument with Elon.</p>
<p>I think SpaceX is an amazing company.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you know, I, in one of my blog posts, I said, what&rsquo;s easy and what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard.</p>
<p>I said, yeah, space X vertical landing rockets.</p>
<p>It had been done before.</p>
<p>Grid fins had been done since the sixties.</p>
<p>Every Soyuz has them.</p>
<p>Reusable space DCX reuse those rockets that landed vertically.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole insurance industry in place for rocket launches.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of infrastructure that was doable.</p>
<p>It took a great entrepreneur, a great personal expense.</p>
<p>He almost drove himself, you know, bankrupt doing it, a great belief to do it.</p>
<p>Whereas Hyperloop, there&rsquo;s a whole bunch more stuff that&rsquo;s never been thought about and</p>
<p>never been demonstrated.</p>
<p>So my estimation is Hyperloop is a long, long, long, a lot further off.</p>
<p>But, and if I&rsquo;ve got a criticism of, of, of Elon, it&rsquo;s that he doesn&rsquo;t make distinctions</p>
<p>between when the technology&rsquo;s coming along and ready.</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;ll go off and mouth off about other things, which then people go and compete</p>
<p>about and try and do.</p>
<p>And so this is where I, I, I, I understand what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>I tend to draw a different distinction.</p>
<p>I, I have a similar kind of harshness towards people who are not telling the truth, who</p>
<p>are basically fabricating stuff to make money or to, well, he believes what he says.</p>
<p>I just think that&rsquo;s a very important difference because I think in order to fly, in order</p>
<p>to get to the moon, you have to believe even when most people tell you you&rsquo;re wrong and</p>
<p>most likely you&rsquo;re wrong, but sometimes you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the same thing I have with Tesla autopilot.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s an interesting one.</p>
<p>I was, especially when I was at MIT and just the entire human factors in the robotics community</p>
<p>were very negative towards Elon.</p>
<p>It was very interesting for me to observe colleagues at MIT.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to make of that.</p>
<p>That was very upsetting to me because I understood where that, where that&rsquo;s coming from.</p>
<p>And I agreed with them and I kind of almost felt the same thing in the beginning until</p>
<p>I kind of opened my eyes and realized there&rsquo;s a lot of interesting ideas here that might</p>
<p>be over hype.</p>
<p>You know, if you focus yourself on the idea that you shouldn&rsquo;t call a system full self</p>
<p>driving when it&rsquo;s obviously not autonomous, fully autonomous, you&rsquo;re going to miss the</p>
<p>magic.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, you are going to miss the magic.</p>
<p>But at the same time, there are people who buy it, literally pay money for it and take</p>
<p>those words as given.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, but I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So that I take words as given is one thing.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t actually seen people that use autopilot that believe that the behavior is really important,</p>
<p>like the actual action.</p>
<p>So like, this is to push back on the very thing that you&rsquo;re frustrated about, which</p>
<p>is like journalists and general people buying all the hype and going out in the same way.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of hype about the negatives of this, too, that people are buying without</p>
<p>using people use the way this is what this was.</p>
<p>This opened my eyes.</p>
<p>Actually, the way people use a product is very different than the way they talk about</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>This is true with robotics, with everything.</p>
<p>Everybody has dreams of how a particular product might be used or so on.</p>
<p>And then when it meets reality, there&rsquo;s a lot of fear of robotics, for example, that</p>
<p>robots are somehow dangerous and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But when you actually have robots in your life, whether it&rsquo;s in the factory or in the</p>
<p>home, making your life better, that&rsquo;s going to be that&rsquo;s way different.</p>
<p>Your perceptions of it are going to be way different.</p>
<p>And so my just tension was like, here&rsquo;s an innovator.</p>
<p>Supercruise from Cadillac was super interesting, too.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really interesting system.</p>
<p>We should be excited by those innovations.</p>
<p>OK, so can I tell you something that&rsquo;s really annoyed me recently?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really annoyed me that the press and friends of mine on Facebook are going, these</p>
<p>billionaires and their space games, why are they doing that?</p>
<p>And that really, really pisses me off.</p>
<p>I must say, I applaud that.</p>
<p>I applaud it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the taking and not necessarily the people who are doing the things, but, you know, that</p>
<p>I keep having to push back against unrealistic expectations when these things can become</p>
<p>real.</p>
<p>Yeah, I this was interesting on because there&rsquo;s been a particular focus for me is autonomous</p>
<p>driving, Elon&rsquo;s prediction of when certain milestones will be hit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several things to be said there that I always I thought about, because whenever</p>
<p>you said them, it was obvious that&rsquo;s not going to me as a person that kind of not inside</p>
<p>the system is obvious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unlikely to hit those.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two comments I want to make.</p>
<p>One, he legitimately believes it.</p>
<p>And two, much more importantly, I think that having ambitious deadlines drives people to</p>
<p>do the best work of their life, even when the odds of those deadlines are very low.</p>
<p>To a point, and I&rsquo;m not talking about anyone here, I&rsquo;m just saying.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a line there, right?</p>
<p>You have to have a line because you overextend and it&rsquo;s demoralizing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s demoralizing, but I will say that there&rsquo;s an additional thing here that those words</p>
<p>also drive the stock market.</p>
<p>And we have because of the way that rich people in the past have manipulated the rubes through</p>
<p>investment, we have developed laws about what you&rsquo;re allowed to say.</p>
<p>And you know, there&rsquo;s an area here which is I tend to be maybe I&rsquo;m naive, but I tend to</p>
<p>believe that like engineers, innovators, people like that, they&rsquo;re not they&rsquo;re my they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think like that, like manipulating the price of the stock price.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s possible that I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m certain it&rsquo;s possible that I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very cynical view of the world because I think most people that run companies, especially</p>
<p>original founders, they yeah, I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s the intent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s eventually it&rsquo;s kind of you you you you fall into that kind of behavior</p>
<p>pattern.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I tend to I wasn&rsquo;t saying I wasn&rsquo;t saying it&rsquo;s falling into that intent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just you also have to protect investors in this environment.</p>
<p>In this market.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>OK, so you have first of all, you have an amazing blog that people should check out.</p>
<p>But you also have this in that blog, a set of predictions.</p>
<p>Such a cool idea.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long ago you started, like three, four years ago.</p>
<p>It was January 1st, 2018.</p>
<p>18.</p>
<p>And I made these predictions and I said that every January 1st, I was going to check back</p>
<p>on how my predictions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a great thought experiment.</p>
<p>For 32 years.</p>
<p>Oh, you said 32 years.</p>
<p>I said 32 years because it&rsquo;s still that&rsquo;ll be January 1st, 2050.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be I will just turn ninety.</p>
<p>Five, you know, and so people know that your predictions, at least for now, are in the</p>
<p>space of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t say I was going to make new predictions.</p>
<p>I was just going to measure this set of predictions that I made because I was sort of I was sort</p>
<p>of annoyed that everyone could make predictions.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t come true and everyone forgot.</p>
<p>So I should hold myself to a high standard.</p>
<p>Yeah, but also just putting years and like date ranges on things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good thought exercise.</p>
<p>Yeah, like and like reasoning your thoughts out.</p>
<p>And so the topics are artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles and space.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was wondering if we could just go through some that stand out maybe from memory.</p>
<p>I can just mention to you some.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about self driving cars, like some predictions that you&rsquo;re particularly proud</p>
<p>of or are particularly interesting from flying cars to the other element here is like how</p>
<p>widespread the location where the deployment of the autonomous vehicles is.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also just a few fun ones.</p>
<p>Is there something that jumps to mind that you remember from the predictions?</p>
<p>Well, I think I did put in there that there would be a dedicated self driving lane on</p>
<p>101 by some year, and I think I was over optimistic on that one.</p>
<p>Yeah, actually.</p>
<p>Yeah, I actually do remember that.</p>
<p>But you I think you were mentioning like difficulties at different cities.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Cambridge, Massachusetts, I think was an example.</p>
<p>Yeah, like in Cambridge Port, you know, I lived in Cambridge Port for a number of years</p>
<p>and you know, the roads are narrow and getting getting anywhere as a human driver is incredibly</p>
<p>frustrating when you start to put and people drive the wrong way on one way streets there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just your prediction was driverless taxi services operating on all streets in</p>
<p>Cambridge Port, Massachusetts in 2035.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that may have been too optimistic.</p>
<p>You think so?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve gotten a little more pessimistic since I made these internally on some of these</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>So what can you put a year to a major milestone of deployment of a taxi service in in a few</p>
<p>major cities like something where you feel like autonomous vehicles are here.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s take the grid streets of San Francisco north of market.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Relatively benign environment, the streets are wide, the major problem is delivery trucks</p>
<p>stopping everywhere, which made things more complicated.</p>
<p>Taxi system there with somewhat designated pickup and drop offs, unlike with Uber and</p>
<p>Lyft, where you can sort of get to any place and the drivers will figure out how to get</p>
<p>in there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still a few years away.</p>
<p>I, you know, I live in that area.</p>
<p>So I see, you know, the self driving car companies cars, multiple multiple ones every day.</p>
<p>Now if they&rsquo;re cruise, Zooks less often, Waymo all the time, different and different ones</p>
<p>come and go.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s always a driver.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always a driver at the moment, although I have noticed that sometimes the driver does</p>
<p>not have the authority to take over without talking to the home office, because they will</p>
<p>sit there waiting for a long time, and clearly something&rsquo;s going on where the home office</p>
<p>is making a decision.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re, you know, and, and so you can see whether they&rsquo;ve got their hands on the</p>
<p>wheel or not.</p>
<p>And, and it&rsquo;s the incident resolution time that tells you, gives you some clues.</p>
<p>So what year do you think, what&rsquo;s your intuition?</p>
<p>What date range are you currently thinking San Francisco would be?</p>
<p>Are you currently thinking San Francisco would be autonomous taxi service from any point</p>
<p>A to any point B without a driver?</p>
<p>Are you still, are you thinking 10 years from now, 20 years from now, 30 years from now?</p>
<p>Certainly not 10 years from now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be longer.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re allowed to go south of market way longer.</p>
<p>And unless it&rsquo;s reengineering of roads.</p>
<p>By the way, what&rsquo;s the biggest challenge?</p>
<p>You mentioned a few.</p>
<p>Is it, is it the delivery trucks?</p>
<p>Is it the edge cases, the computer perception, well, here&rsquo;s a case that I saw outside my</p>
<p>house a few weeks ago, about 8pm on a Friday night, it was getting dark, it was before</p>
<p>the solstice.</p>
<p>It was a cruise vehicle come down the hill, turned right and stopped dead, covering the</p>
<p>crosswalk.</p>
<p>Why did it stop dead?</p>
<p>Because there was a human just two feet from it.</p>
<p>Now, I just glanced, I knew what was happening.</p>
<p>The human was a woman was at the door of her car trying to unlock it with one of those</p>
<p>things that, you know, when you don&rsquo;t have a key.</p>
<p>That car thought, oh, she could jump out in front of me any second.</p>
<p>As a human, I could tell, no, she&rsquo;s not going to jump out.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s busy trying to unlock her.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s lost her keys.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s trying to get in the car.</p>
<p>And it stayed there for, until I got bored.</p>
<p>And so the human driver in there did not take over.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the kicker to me.</p>
<p>A guy comes down the hill with a stroller, I assume there&rsquo;s a baby in there, and now</p>
<p>the crosswalk&rsquo;s blocked by this cruise vehicle.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s he going to do?</p>
<p>Cleverly, I think, he decided not to go in front of the car.</p>
<p>But he had to go behind it.</p>
<p>He had to get off the crosswalk, out into the intersection, to push his baby around</p>
<p>this car, which was stopped there.</p>
<p>And no human driver would have stopped there for that length of time.</p>
<p>They would have got out and out of the way.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s another one of my pet peeves, that safety is being compromised for individuals</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t sign up for having this happen in their neighborhood.</p>
<p>Now you can say that&rsquo;s an edge case, but&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I&rsquo;m in general not a fan of anecdotal evidence for stuff like this is one of my</p>
<p>biggest problems with the discussion of autonomous vehicles in general, people that criticize</p>
<p>them or support them are using edge cases, are using anecdotal evidence, but I got you.</p>
<p>Your question is, when is it going to happen in San Francisco?</p>
<p>I say not soon, but it&rsquo;s going to be one of them.</p>
<p>But where it is going to happen is in limited domains, campuses of various sorts, gated</p>
<p>communities where the other drivers are not arbitrary people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re people who know about these things, they&rsquo;ve been warned about them, and at velocities</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s always safe to stop dead.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do that on the freeway.</p>
<p>That I think we&rsquo;re going to start to see, and they may not be shaped like current cars,</p>
<p>they may be things like May Mobility has those things and various companies have these.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder if that&rsquo;s a compelling experience.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s not just about automation, it&rsquo;s about creating a product that makes your&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just cheaper, but it&rsquo;s fun to ride.</p>
<p>One of the least fun things is for a car that stops and waits.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something deeply frustrating for us humans for the rest of the world to take advantage</p>
<p>of us as we wait.</p>
<p>But think about not you as the customer, but someone who&rsquo;s in their 80s in a retirement</p>
<p>village whose kids have said, you&rsquo;re not driving anymore, and this gives you the freedom to</p>
<p>go to the market.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hugely beneficial thing, but it&rsquo;s a very few orders of magnitude less impact</p>
<p>on the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a few people in a small community using cars as opposed to the entirety of the</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>I like that the first time that a car equipped with some version of a solution to the trolley</p>
<p>problem is&hellip;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s NIML stand for?</p>
<p>Not in my life.</p>
<p>I define my lifetime as up to 2050.</p>
<p>You know, I ask you, when have you had to decide which person shall I kill?</p>
<p>No, you put the brakes on and you break as hard as you can.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not making that decision.</p>
<p>I do think autonomous vehicles or semi autonomous vehicles do need to solve the whole pedestrian</p>
<p>problem that has elements of the trolley problem within it, but it&rsquo;s not&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, well, and I talk about it in one of the articles or blog posts that I wrote, and</p>
<p>people have told me, one of my coworkers has told me he does this.</p>
<p>He tortures autonomously driven vehicles and pedestrians will torture them.</p>
<p>Now, once they realize that putting one foot off the curb makes the car think that they</p>
<p>might walk into the road, teenagers will be doing that all the time.</p>
<p>I, by the way, one of my, and this is a whole nother discussion, because my main interest</p>
<p>with robotics is HRI, human robot interaction.</p>
<p>I believe that robots that interact with humans will have to push back.</p>
<p>Like they can&rsquo;t just be bullied because that creates a very uncompelling experience for</p>
<p>the humans.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you know, Waymo, before it was called Waymo, discovered that, you know, they</p>
<p>had to do that at four way intersections.</p>
<p>They had to nudge forward to give the cue that they were going to go, because otherwise</p>
<p>the other drivers would just beat them all the time.</p>
<p>So you cofounded iRobot, as we mentioned, one of the most successful robotics companies</p>
<p>ever.</p>
<p>What are you most proud of with that company and the approach you took to robotics?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m quite proud of there, which may be a surprise, but, you know,</p>
<p>I was still on the board when this happened, it was March 2011, and we sent robots to Japan</p>
<p>and they were used to help shut down the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, which was, everything</p>
<p>was, I&rsquo;ve been there since, I was there in 2014, and the robots, some of the robots were</p>
<p>still there.</p>
<p>I was proud that we were able to do that.</p>
<p>Why were we able to do that?</p>
<p>And, you know, people have said, well, you know, Japan is so good at robotics.</p>
<p>It was because we had had about 6,500 robots deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, teleopt,</p>
<p>but with intelligence, dealing with roadside bombs.</p>
<p>So we had, it was at that time, nine years of in field experience with the robots in</p>
<p>harsh conditions, whereas the Japanese robots, which were, you know, getting, this goes back</p>
<p>to what annoys me so much, getting all the hype, look at that, look at that Honda robot,</p>
<p>it can walk, wow, the future&rsquo;s here, couldn&rsquo;t do a thing because they weren&rsquo;t deployed,</p>
<p>but we had deployed in really harsh conditions for a long time, and so we&rsquo;re able to do</p>
<p>something very positive in a very bad situation.</p>
<p>What about just the simple, and for people who don&rsquo;t know, one of the things that iRobot</p>
<p>has created is the Roomba vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p>What about the simple robot that, that is the Roomba, quote unquote, simple, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>deployed in tens of millions of, in tens of millions of homes?</p>
<p>What do you think about that?</p>
<p>Well, I make the joke that I started out life as a pure mathematician and turned into a</p>
<p>vacuum cleaner salesman, so if you&rsquo;re going to be an entrepreneur, be ready for, be ready</p>
<p>to do anything, but I was, you know, there was a, there was a wacky lawsuit that I got</p>
<p>opposed for not too many years ago, and I was the only one who had emailed from the</p>
<p>1990s, and no one in the company had it, so I went and went through my email, and it</p>
<p>reminded me of, you know, the joy of what we were doing, and what was I doing?</p>
<p>What was I doing at the time we were building, building the Roomba?</p>
<p>One of the things was we had this, you know, incredibly tight budget because we wanted</p>
<p>to put it on the shelves at $200.</p>
<p>There was another home cleaning robot at the time, it was the Electrolux Trilobite, which</p>
<p>sold for 2,000 euros, and to us that was not going to be a consumer product, so we had</p>
<p>reason to believe that $200 was a, was a thing that people would buy at.</p>
<p>That was our aim, but that meant we had, you know, that&rsquo;s on the shelf making profit.</p>
<p>That means the cost of goods has to be minimal, so I find all these emails of me going, you</p>
<p>know, I&rsquo;d be in Taipei for a MIT meeting, and I&rsquo;d stay a few extra days and go down</p>
<p>to Hsinchu and talk to these little tiny companies, lots of little tiny companies outside of TSMC,</p>
<p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, which let all these little companies be fabulous.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have to have their own fab so they could innovate, and they were building,</p>
<p>their innovations were to build, strip down 6802s, 6802 was what was in an Apple I, get</p>
<p>rid of half the silicon and still have it be viable, and I&rsquo;d previously got some of</p>
<p>those for some earlier failed products of iRobot, and that was in Hong Kong going to</p>
<p>all these companies that built, you know, they weren&rsquo;t gaming in the current sense,</p>
<p>there were these handheld games that you would play, or birthday cards, because we had about</p>
<p>a 50 cent budget for computation, so I&rsquo;m trekking from place to place looking at their chips,</p>
<p>looking at what they&rsquo;d removed, ah, their interrupt handling is too weak for a general</p>
<p>purpose, so I was going deep technical detail, and then I found this one from a company called</p>
<p>Winbond, which had, and I&rsquo;d forgotten it had this much RAM, it had 512 bytes of RAM,</p>
<p>and it was in our budget, and it had all the capabilities we needed.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you were excited.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I was reading all these emails, Colin, I found this, so.</p>
<p>Did you think, did you ever think that you guys could be so successful?</p>
<p>Like, eventually this company would be so successful, could you possibly have imagined?</p>
<p>No, we never did think that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d had 14 failed business models up to 2002, and then we had two winners the same year.</p>
<p>No, and then, you know, we, I remember the board, because by this time we had some venture</p>
<p>capital in, the board went along with us building some robots for, you know, aiming at the Christmas</p>
<p>2002 market, and we went three times over what they authorized and built 70,000 of them,</p>
<p>and sold them all in that first, because we released on September 18th, and they were</p>
<p>all sold by Christmas.</p>
<p>So it was, so we were gutsy, but.</p>
<p>But yeah, you didn&rsquo;t think this will take over the world.</p>
<p>Well, this is, so a lot of amazing robotics companies have gone under over the past few</p>
<p>decades.</p>
<p>Why do you think it&rsquo;s so damn hard to run a successful robotics company?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few things.</p>
<p>One is expectations of capabilities by the founders that are off base.</p>
<p>The founders, not the consumer, the founders.</p>
<p>Yeah, expectations of what can be delivered.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Mispricing, and what a customer thinks is a valid price, is not rational, necessarily.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And expectations of customers, and just the sheer hardness of getting people to adopt a</p>
<p>new technology.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve suffered from all three of these, you know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had more failures than successes, in terms of companies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve suffered from all three.</p>
<p>So, do you think one day there will be a robotics company, and by robotics company, I mean, where</p>
<p>your primary source of income is from robots, that will be a trillion plus dollar company?</p>
<p>And if so, what would that company do?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, you know, because I&rsquo;m still starting robot companies.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not making any such predictions in my own mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not thinking about a trillion dollar company.</p>
<p>And by the way, I don&rsquo;t think, you know, in the 90s, anyone was thinking that Apple would</p>
<p>ever be a trillion dollar company.</p>
<p>So, these are, these are, you know, these are, you know, these are, you know, these</p>
<p>would be a trillion dollar company, so these are, these are very hard to predict.</p>
<p>But, sorry to interrupt, but don&rsquo;t you, because I kind of have a vision in a small way, and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a big vision in a small way, that I see that there would be robots in the home,</p>
<p>at scale, like Roomba, but more.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s trillion dollar.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a real market pull for them because of the demographic inversion,</p>
<p>you know, who&rsquo;s going to do all the stuff for the older people?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s too many, you know, I&rsquo;m leading here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be too many of us.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t have capable enough robots to make that economic argument at this point.</p>
<p>Do I expect that that will happen?</p>
<p>Yes, I expect it will happen.</p>
<p>But I got to tell you, we introduced the Roomba in 2002, and I stayed another</p>
<p>nine years.</p>
<p>We were always trying to find what the next home robot would be, and still today, the</p>
<p>primary product of 20 years late, almost 20 years later, 19 years later, the primary product</p>
<p>is still the Roomba.</p>
<p>So iRobot hasn&rsquo;t found the next one.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible for one person in the garage to build it versus, like, Google</p>
<p>launching Google self driving car that turns into Waymo?</p>
<p>Do you think this is almost like what it takes to build a successful robotics company?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to go from the ground up, or is it just too much capital</p>
<p>investment?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s very hard to get there without a lot of capital.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re starting to see, you know, fair chunks of capital for some robotics companies.</p>
<p>You know, Series B&rsquo;s, I saw one yesterday for $80 million, I think it was, for Covariant.</p>
<p>But it can take real money to get into these things, and you may fail along the way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve certainly failed at Rethink Robotics, and we lost $150 million in capital there.</p>
<p>So, okay, so Rethink Robotics is another amazing robotics company you cofounded.</p>
<p>So what was the vision there?</p>
<p>What was the dream?</p>
<p>And what are you most proud of with Rethink Robotics?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m most proud of the fact that we got robots out of the cage in factories that were safe,</p>
<p>absolutely safe, for people and robots to be next to each other.</p>
<p>So these are robotic arms.</p>
<p>Robotic arms.</p>
<p>Able to pick up stuff and interact with humans.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that humans could retask them without writing code.</p>
<p>And now that&rsquo;s sort of become an expectation for a lot of other little companies and big</p>
<p>companies, our advertising they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s both an interface problem and also a safety problem.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m most proud of that.</p>
<p>I completely, I let myself be talked out of what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>And, you know, you always got, you know, I can&rsquo;t replay the tape.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t replay it.</p>
<p>Maybe, you know, if I&rsquo;d been stronger on, and I remember the day, I remember the exact</p>
<p>meeting.</p>
<p>Can you take me through that meeting?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d said that I&rsquo;d set as a target for the company that we were going to build $3,000</p>
<p>robots with force feedback that was safe for people to be around.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>That was my goal.</p>
<p>And we built, so we started in 2008, and we had prototypes built of plastic, plastic</p>
<p>gearboxes, and at a $3,000, you know, lifetime, or $3,000, I was saying, we&rsquo;re going to go</p>
<p>after not the people who already have robot arms in factories, the people who would never</p>
<p>have a robot arm.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to go after a different market.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t have to meet their expectations.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re going to build it out of plastic.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to have a $35,000 lifetime.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be so cheap that it&rsquo;s OpEx, not CapEx.</p>
<p>And so we had a prototype that worked reasonably well, but the control engineers were complaining</p>
<p>about these plastic gearboxes with a beautiful little planetary gearbox that we could use</p>
<p>something called series elastic actuators.</p>
<p>We embedded them in there.</p>
<p>We could measure forces.</p>
<p>We knew when we hit something, et cetera.</p>
<p>The control engineers were saying, yeah, but there&rsquo;s this torque ripple because these plastic</p>
<p>gears, they&rsquo;re not great gears, and there&rsquo;s this ripple, and trying to do force control</p>
<p>around this ripple is so hard.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not going to name names, but I remember one of the mechanical engineers saying, we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>just build a metal gearbox with spur gears, and it&rsquo;ll take six weeks.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be done.</p>
<p>Problem solved.</p>
<p>Two years later, we got the spur gearbox working.</p>
<p>We cost reduced it every possible way we could, but now the price went up too.</p>
<p>And then the CEO at the time said, well, we have to have two arms, not one arm.</p>
<p>So our first robot product, Baxter, now cost $25,000, and the only people who were going</p>
<p>to look at that were people who had arms in factories because that was somewhat cheaper</p>
<p>for two arms than arms in factories.</p>
<p>But they were used to 0.1 millimeter reproducibility of motion and certain velocities, and I kept</p>
<p>thinking, but that&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re giving you.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need position repeatability.</p>
<p>Use force control like a human does.</p>
<p>No, no, but we want that repeatability.</p>
<p>We want that repeatability.</p>
<p>All the other robots have that repeatability.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you have that repeatability?</p>
<p>So can you clarify?</p>
<p>Force control is you can grab the arm and you can move it.</p>
<p>You can move it around, but suppose you&hellip;</p>
<p>Can you see that?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Suppose this thing is a precise thing that&rsquo;s got to fit here in this right angle.</p>
<p>Under position control, you have fixtured where this is.</p>
<p>You know where this is precisely, and you just move it, and it goes there.</p>
<p>In force control, you would do something like slide over here till we feel that and slide</p>
<p>it in there, and that&rsquo;s how a human gets precision.</p>
<p>They use force feedback and get the things to mate rather than just go straight to it.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t convince our customers who were in factories and were used to thinking about</p>
<p>things a certain way, and they wanted it, wanted it, wanted it.</p>
<p>So then we said, okay, we&rsquo;re going to build an arm that gives you that.</p>
<p>So now we ended up building a $35,000 robot with one arm with&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, what are they called?</p>
<p>A certain sort of gearbox made by a company whose name I can&rsquo;t remember right now, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the name of the gearbox.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s got torque ripple in it.</p>
<p>So now there was an extra two years of solving the problem of doing the force with the torque</p>
<p>ripple.</p>
<p>So we had to do the thing we had avoided for the plastic gearboxes, which is a little bit</p>
<p>for the plastic gearboxes we ended up having to do.</p>
<p>The robot was now overpriced and they&hellip;</p>
<p>And that was your intuition from the very beginning kind of that this is not&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re opening a door to solve a lot of problems that you&rsquo;re eventually going to have to solve</p>
<p>this problem anyway.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And also I was aiming at a low price to go into a different market.</p>
<p>Low price.</p>
<p>That didn&rsquo;t have robots.</p>
<p>$3,000 would be amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think we could have done it for five.</p>
<p>But, you know, you talked about setting the goal a little too far for the engineers.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So why would you say that company not failed, but went under?</p>
<p>We had buyers and there&rsquo;s this thing called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the</p>
<p>U.S., CFIUS.</p>
<p>And that had previously been invoked twice.</p>
<p>Around where the government could stop foreign money coming into a U.S. company based on</p>
<p>defense requirements.</p>
<p>We went through due diligence multiple times.</p>
<p>We were going to get acquired, but every consortium had Chinese money in it, and all the bankers</p>
<p>would say at the last minute, you know, this isn&rsquo;t going to get past CFIUS, and the investors</p>
<p>would go away.</p>
<p>And then we had two buyers, once we were about to run out of money, two buyers, and one used</p>
<p>heavy handed legal stuff with the other one, said they were going to take it and pay more,</p>
<p>dropped out when we were out of cash, and then bought the assets at 1 30th of the price</p>
<p>they had offered a week before.</p>
<p>It was a tough week.</p>
<p>Do you, does it hurt to think about like an amazing company that didn&rsquo;t, you know, like</p>
<p>iRobot didn&rsquo;t find a way?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was tough.</p>
<p>I said I was never going to start another company.</p>
<p>I was pleased that everyone liked what we did so much that the team was hired by three</p>
<p>companies, and I was very happy that we were able to do that.</p>
<p>Three companies within a week.</p>
<p>Everyone had a job in one of these three companies.</p>
<p>Some stayed in their same desks because another company came in and rented the space.</p>
<p>So I felt good about people not being out on the street.</p>
<p>So Baxter has a screen with a face.</p>
<p>What, that&rsquo;s a revolutionary idea for a robot manipulation, like for a robotic arm.</p>
<p>How much opposition did you get?</p>
<p>Well, first the screen was also used during codeless programming.</p>
<p>We taught by demonstration.</p>
<p>It showed you what its understanding of the task was.</p>
<p>So it had two roles.</p>
<p>Some customers hated it, and so we made it so that when the robot was running it could</p>
<p>be showing graphs of what was happening and not show the eyes.</p>
<p>Other people, and some of them surprised me who they were, saying well this one doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>look as human as the old one.</p>
<p>We liked the human looking.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there was a mixed bag.</p>
<p>But do you think that&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m kind of disappointed whenever I talk to</p>
<p>roboticists, like the best robotics people in the world, they seem to not want to do</p>
<p>the eyes type of thing.</p>
<p>Like they seem to see it as a machine as opposed to a machine that can also have a human connection.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what to do with that.</p>
<p>It seems like a lost opportunity.</p>
<p>I think the trillion dollar company will have to do the human connection very well no matter</p>
<p>what it does.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a ridiculous question?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I might give a ridiculous answer.</p>
<p>Do you think, well maybe by way of asking the question, let me first mention that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>kind of critical of the idea of the Turing test as a test of intelligence.</p>
<p>Let me first ask this question.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll be able to build an AI system that humans fall in love with and it</p>
<p>falls in love with the human, like romantic love?</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ve had that with humans falling in love with cars even back in the 50s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different love, right?</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lifelong partnership where you can communicate and grow like&hellip;</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re a long way from that.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re a long, long way.</p>
<p>I think Blade Runner had the time scale totally wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah, but so to me, honestly, the most difficult part is the thing that you said with the Marvex</p>
<p>Paradox is to create a human form that interacts and perceives the world.</p>
<p>But if we just look at a voice, like the movie Her or just like an Alexa type voice, I tend</p>
<p>to think we&rsquo;re not that far away.</p>
<p>Well, for some people, maybe not, but as humans, as we think about the future, we always try</p>
<p>to&hellip;</p>
<p>And this is the premise of most science fiction movies.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got the world just as it is today and you change one thing.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not how&hellip;</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same with a self driving car.</p>
<p>You change one thing.</p>
<p>No, everything changes.</p>
<p>Everything grows together.</p>
<p>So surprisingly, it might be surprising to you or might not, I think the best movie about</p>
<p>this stuff was Bicentennial Man.</p>
<p>And what was happening there?</p>
<p>It was schmaltzy and, you know, but what was happening there?</p>
<p>As the robot was trying to become more human, the humans were adopting the technology of</p>
<p>the robot and changing their bodies.</p>
<p>So there was a convergence happening in a sense.</p>
<p>So we will not be the same.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re already talking about genetically modifying our babies.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s more and more stuff happening around that.</p>
<p>We will want to modify ourselves even more for all sorts of things.</p>
<p>We put all sorts of technology in our bodies to improve it.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve got things in my ears so that I can sort of hear you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re always modifying our bodies.</p>
<p>So, you know, I think it&rsquo;s hard to imagine exactly what it will be like in the future.</p>
<p>But on the Turing test side, do you think, so forget about love for a second, let&rsquo;s talk</p>
<p>about just like the Alexa Prize.</p>
<p>Actually, I was invited to be a part of the Alexa Prize.</p>
<p>Actually, I was invited to be a, what is the interviewer for the Alexa Prize or whatever</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in two days.</p>
<p>Their idea is success looks like a person wanting to talk to an AI system for a prolonged</p>
<p>period of time, like 20 minutes.</p>
<p>How far away are we and why is it difficult to build an AI system with which you&rsquo;d want</p>
<p>to have a beer and talk for an hour or two hours?</p>
<p>Like not for to check the weather or to check music, but just like to talk as friends.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you know, we saw Weizenbaum back in the 60s with his programmer, Elisa, being</p>
<p>shocked at how much people would talk to Elisa.</p>
<p>And I remember, you know, in the 70s typing, you know, stuff to Elisa to see what it would</p>
<p>come back with.</p>
<p>You know, I think right now, and this is a thing that Amazon&rsquo;s been trying to improve</p>
<p>with Alexa, there is no continuity of topic.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not, you can&rsquo;t refer to what we talked about yesterday.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the same as talking to a person where there seems to be an ongoing existence, which</p>
<p>changes.</p>
<p>We share moments together and they last in our memory together.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s none of that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no sort of intention of these systems that they have any goal in life, even</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s to be happy, you know, they don&rsquo;t even have a semblance of that.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not saying this can&rsquo;t be done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying, I think this is why we don&rsquo;t feel that way about them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a sort of a minimal requirement.</p>
<p>If you want the sort of interaction you&rsquo;re talking about, it&rsquo;s a minimal requirement.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s going to be sufficient, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t seen it yet.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what it feels like.</p>
<p>I tend to think it&rsquo;s not as difficult as solving intelligence, for example, and I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>achievable in the near term.</p>
<p>But on the Turing test, why don&rsquo;t you think the Turing test is a good test of intelligence?</p>
<p>Oh, because, you know, again, the Turing, if you read the paper, Turing wasn&rsquo;t saying</p>
<p>this is a good test.</p>
<p>He was using it as a rhetorical device to argue that if you can&rsquo;t tell the difference</p>
<p>between a computer and a person, you must say that the computer&rsquo;s thinking because you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t tell the difference, you know, when it&rsquo;s thinking.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t say something different.</p>
<p>What it has become as this sort of weird game of fooling people, so back at the AI Lab in</p>
<p>the late 80s, we had this thing that still goes on called the AI Olympics, and one of</p>
<p>the events we had one year was the original imitation game, as Turing talked about, because</p>
<p>he starts by saying, can you tell whether it&rsquo;s a man or a woman?</p>
<p>So we did that at the Lab.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d go and type, and the thing would come back, and you had to tell whether it was a</p>
<p>man or a woman, and one man came up with a question that he could ask, which was always</p>
<p>a dead giveaway of whether the other person was really a man or a woman.</p>
<p>He would ask them, did you have green plastic toy soldiers as a kid?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What did you do with them?</p>
<p>And a woman trying to be a man would say, oh, I lined them up.</p>
<p>We had wars.</p>
<p>We had battles.</p>
<p>And the man, just being a man, would say, I stomped on them.</p>
<p>I burned them.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what the Turing test with computers has become.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the trick question?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I say it&rsquo;s sort of devolved into this weirdness.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, conversation not formulated as a test is a fascinatingly challenging dance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really hard problem.</p>
<p>To me, conversation, when non poses a test, is a more intuitive illustration how far away</p>
<p>we are from solving intelligence than computer vision.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>Computer vision is harder for me to pull apart.</p>
<p>But with language, with conversation, you could see.</p>
<p>Because language is so human.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so human.</p>
<p>We can so clearly see it.</p>
<p>Shit, you mentioned something I was going to go off on.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>I mean, I have to ask you, because you were the head of CSAIL, AI Lab, for a long time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>To me, when I came to MIT, you were one of the greats at MIT.</p>
<p>So what was that time like?</p>
<p>And plus, you&rsquo;re friends with, but you knew Minsky and all the folks there, all the legendary</p>
<p>AI people of which you&rsquo;re one.</p>
<p>So what was that time like?</p>
<p>What are memories that stand out to you from that time, from your time at MIT, from the</p>
<p>AI Lab, from the dreams that the AI Lab represented, to the actual revolutionary work?</p>
<p>Well, let me tell you first the disappointment in myself.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve been researching this book, and so many of the players were active in the 50s</p>
<p>and 60s, I knew many of them when they were older, and I didn&rsquo;t ask them all the questions</p>
<p>now I wish I had asked.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d sit with them at our Thursday lunches, which we had a faculty lunch, and I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ask them so many questions that now I wish I had.</p>
<p>Can I ask you that question?</p>
<p>Because you wrote that.</p>
<p>You wrote that you were fortunate to know and rub shoulders with many of the greats,</p>
<p>those who founded AI, robotics, and computer science, and the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>And you wrote that your big regret nowadays is that often I have questions for those who</p>
<p>have passed on, and I didn&rsquo;t think to ask them any of these questions, even as I saw</p>
<p>them and said hello to them on a daily basis.</p>
<p>So maybe also another question I want to ask, if you could talk to them today, what question</p>
<p>would you ask?</p>
<p>What questions would you ask?</p>
<p>Well, Licklider, I would ask him.</p>
<p>You know, he had the vision for humans and computers working together, and he really</p>
<p>founded that at DARPA, and he gave the money to MIT, which started Project MAC in 1963.</p>
<p>And I would have talked to him about what the successes were, what the failures were,</p>
<p>what he saw as progress, etc.</p>
<p>I would have asked him more questions about that, because now I could use it in my book,</p>
<p>you know, but I think it&rsquo;s lost.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s lost forever.</p>
<p>A lot of the motivations are lost.</p>
<p>I should have asked Marvin why he and Seymour Pappert came down so hard on neural networks</p>
<p>in 1968 in their book Perceptrons, because Marvin&rsquo;s PhD thesis was all about neural networks.</p>
<p>And how do you make sense of that?</p>
<p>That book destroyed the field.</p>
<p>He probably, do you think he knew the effect that book would have?</p>
<p>All the theorems are negative theorems.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way of, that&rsquo;s the way of life.</p>
<p>But still, it&rsquo;s kind of tragic that he was both the proponent and the destroyer of neural</p>
<p>networks.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is there other memories stand out from the robotics and the AI work at MIT?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, but you gotta be more specific.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, like, it&rsquo;s such a magical place.</p>
<p>I mean, to me, it&rsquo;s a little bit also heartbreaking that, you know, with Google and Facebook,</p>
<p>like DeepMind and so on, so much of the talent, you know, it doesn&rsquo;t stay necessarily</p>
<p>for prolonged periods of time in these universities.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, some of the companies are more guilty than others of paying fabulous salaries to</p>
<p>some of the highest, you know, producers.</p>
<p>And then just, you never hear from them again.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not allowed to give public talks.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sort of locked away.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sort of like collecting, you know, Hollywood stars or something.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not allowed to make movies anymore.</p>
<p>I own them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s tragic because, I mean, there&rsquo;s an openness to the university setting where you</p>
<p>do research to both in the space of ideas and like publication, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, and, you know, there&rsquo;s the publication and all that.</p>
<p>And often, you know, although these places say they publish.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s pressure.</p>
<p>But I think, for instance, you know, on net net, I think Google buying those eight or</p>
<p>nine robotics company was bad for the field because it locked those people away.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have to make the company succeed anymore, locked them away for years, and then</p>
<p>sort of all frid it away.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So do you have hope for MIT, for MIT?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why shouldn&rsquo;t I?</p>
<p>Well, I could be harsh and say that I&rsquo;m not sure I would say MIT is leading the world</p>
<p>in AI or even Stanford or Berkeley.</p>
<p>I would say, I would say DeepMind, Google AI, Facebook AI, all of those things.</p>
<p>I would take a slightly different approach, a different answer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come back to Facebook in a minute.</p>
<p>But I think those other places are following a dream of one of the founders.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure that it&rsquo;s well founded, the dream.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure that it&rsquo;s going to have the impact that he believes it is.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about Facebook and Google and so on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about Google.</p>
<p>Google.</p>
<p>But the thing is, those research labs aren&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s the big dream.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m usually a fan of no matter what the dream is, a big dream is a unifier.</p>
<p>Because what happens is you have a lot of bright minds working together on a dream.</p>
<p>What results is a lot of adjacent ideas and how so much progress is made.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;re actually leading.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that the universities are leading.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think those companies are leading in general because they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>we saw this incredible spike in attendees at NeurIPS.</p>
<p>And as I said in my January 1st review this year for 2020, 2020 will not be</p>
<p>remembered as a watershed year for machine learning or AI.</p>
<p>There was nothing surprising happened anyway.</p>
<p>Unlike when deep learning hit ImageNet.</p>
<p>That was a shake.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot more people writing papers, but the papers are fundamentally</p>
<p>boring and uninteresting.</p>
<p>Incremental work.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is there a particular memories you have with Minsky or somebody else at</p>
<p>MIT that stand out, funny stories?</p>
<p>I mean, unfortunately, he&rsquo;s another one that&rsquo;s passed away.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve known some of the biggest minds in AI.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you know, they, they did amazing things and sometimes they were grumpy.</p>
<p>Well, he was, uh, he was interesting cause he was very grumpy, but that,</p>
<p>that was his, uh, I remember him saying in an interview that the key to success</p>
<p>or being to keep being productive is to hate everything you&rsquo;ve ever done in the past.</p>
<p>Maybe that, maybe that explains the Perceptron book.</p>
<p>There it was.</p>
<p>He told you exactly.</p>
<p>But he, meaning like, just like, I mean, maybe that&rsquo;s the way to not</p>
<p>treat yourself too seriously.</p>
<p>Just, uh, you know, you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not treating yourself too seriously.</p>
<p>Just, uh, always be moving forward.</p>
<p>Uh, that was the idea.</p>
<p>I mean, that, that crankiness, I mean, there&rsquo;s a, uh, that&rsquo;s the scary.</p>
<p>So let me, let me, let me tell you, uh, you know, what really, um, you know,</p>
<p>the joy memories are about having access to technology before anyone else has seen</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>You know, I got to Stanford in 1977 and we had, um, you know, we had terminals</p>
<p>that could show live video on them.</p>
<p>Um, digital, digital sound system.</p>
<p>We had a Xerox graphics printer.</p>
<p>We could print, um, uh, it wasn&rsquo;t, you know, it wasn&rsquo;t like a typewriter</p>
<p>ball hitting in characters.</p>
<p>It could print arbitrary things.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, one bit, you know, black or white, but you get arbitrary pictures.</p>
<p>This was science fiction sort of stuff.</p>
<p>Um, um, at, at MIT, the, uh, the list machines, which, you know, they were the</p>
<p>first personal computers and, you know, cost a hundred thousand dollars each.</p>
<p>And I could, you know, I got there early enough in the day.</p>
<p>I got one for the day.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t, couldn&rsquo;t stand up.</p>
<p>I had to keep working.</p>
<p>Um, um, so they&rsquo;re having that like direct glimpse into the future.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, and, you know, I&rsquo;ve had email every day since 1977.</p>
<p>Um, and, uh, you know, the, the host field was only eight bits, you know, that many</p>
<p>places, but I could send the email to other people at a few places.</p>
<p>So that was, that was pretty exciting to be in that world so different from what</p>
<p>the rest of the world knew.</p>
<p>Um, uh, uh, let me ask you probably edit this out, but just in case you have a</p>
<p>story, uh, I&rsquo;m hanging out with Don Knuth, uh, for a while tomorrow.</p>
<p>Did you ever get a chance to such a different world than yours?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a very kind of theoretical computer science, the puzzle of, uh, of, uh, computer</p>
<p>science and mathematics.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re so much about the magic of robotics, like the practice of it.</p>
<p>You mentioned him earlier for like, not, you know, about computation.</p>
<p>Did your worlds cross?</p>
<p>They did enough.</p>
<p>You know, I, I know him now we talk, you know, but let me tell you my, my Donald</p>
<p>Knuth story.</p>
<p>So, um, you know, besides, you know, analysis of algorithms, he&rsquo;s well known for</p>
<p>writing tech, which is in LaTeX, which is the academic publishing system.</p>
<p>So he did that at the AI lab and he would do it.</p>
<p>He would work overnight at the AI lab.</p>
<p>And one, one day, one night, the, uh, the mainframe computer went down and, um, uh,</p>
<p>a guy named Robert Pore was there.</p>
<p>He did his PhD at the Media Lab at MIT and he was, um, you know, an engineer.</p>
<p>And so I, he and I, you know, tracked down what were the problem was.</p>
<p>It was one of this big refrigerator size or washing machine size disk drives had</p>
<p>failed.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what brought the whole system down.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got panels pulled off and we&rsquo;re pulling, you know, circuit cards out.</p>
<p>And Donald Knuth, who&rsquo;s a really tall guy walks in and he&rsquo;s looking down and says,</p>
<p>when will it be fixed?</p>
<p>You know, cause he wanted to get back to writing his tech system.</p>
<p>And so we, we figured out, you know, it was a particular chip, 7,400 series chip,</p>
<p>which was socketed.</p>
<p>We popped it out.</p>
<p>We put a replacement in, put it back in.</p>
<p>Smoke comes out cause we put it in backwards.</p>
<p>Cause we were so nervous that Donald Knuth was standing over us.</p>
<p>Anyway, we eventually got it fixed and got the mainframe running again.</p>
<p>So that was your little, when was that again?</p>
<p>Well, that must have been before October 79.</p>
<p>Cause we moved out of that building then.</p>
<p>So sometime probably 78 sometime early 79.</p>
<p>Yeah, those, all those figures is just fascinating.</p>
<p>All the people with pass, pass through MIT is really fascinating.</p>
<p>Is there, let me ask you to put on your big wise man hat.</p>
<p>Is there advice that you can give to young people today,</p>
<p>whether in high school or college who are thinking about their career</p>
<p>or thinking about life, how to live a life they&rsquo;re proud of, a successful life?</p>
<p>Yeah. So, so many people ask me for advice and have asked for,</p>
<p>and I give, I talk to a lot of people all the time and there is no one way.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a lot of pressure to produce papers</p>
<p>that will be acceptable and be published.</p>
<p>Maybe I was, maybe I can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Maybe I was, maybe I come from an age where I would,</p>
<p>I could be a rebel against that and still succeed.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s harder today, but I think it&rsquo;s important not to get too caught up</p>
<p>with what everyone else is doing.</p>
<p>And if you, if, well, it depends on what you want of life.</p>
<p>If you want to have real impact, you have to be ready to fail a lot of times.</p>
<p>So you have to make a lot of unsafe decisions.</p>
<p>And the only way to make that work is to make, keep doing it for a long time.</p>
<p>And then one of them will be work out.</p>
<p>And so that, that, that will make something successful.</p>
<p>Or not.</p>
<p>Or yeah, or you may, or you just may, you know, end up, you know,</p>
<p>not having a, you know, having a lousy career.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s certainly possible.</p>
<p>Taking the risk is the thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no way to, to make all safe decisions and actually really contribute.</p>
<p>Do you think about your death, about your mortality?</p>
<p>I got to say when COVID hit, I did.</p>
<p>Because we did, you know, in the early days, we didn&rsquo;t know how bad it was going to be.</p>
<p>And I, that, that made me work on my book harder for a while,</p>
<p>but then I&rsquo;d started this company and now I&rsquo;m doing full time,</p>
<p>more than full time of the company.</p>
<p>So the book&rsquo;s on hold, but I do want to finish this book.</p>
<p>When you think about it, are you afraid of it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid of dribbling, you know, of losing it.</p>
<p>The details of, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But the fact that the ride ends, I&rsquo;ve known that for a long time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, yeah, but there&rsquo;s knowing and knowing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a, yeah.</p>
<p>And it really sucks.</p>
<p>It feels, it feels a lot closer.</p>
<p>So my, in, in my, my blog with my predictions, my sort of push back against that was that I said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to review these every year for 32 years and that puts me into my mid nineties.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s my whole every, every time you write the blog posts,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting closer and closer to your own prediction of your death.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What do you hope your legacy is?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the greatest roboticist AI researchers of all time.</p>
<p>What I hope is that I actually finished writing this book</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s one person who reads it and see something about changing the way they&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<p>And that leads to the next big.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;ll be on a podcast a hundred years from now saying I once read that book</p>
<p>and that changed everything.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>This whole thing, the existence, the, the, the, all the hurried things we do</p>
<p>on this planet, what do you think is the meaning of it all?</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, you know, I think we&rsquo;re all really bad at it.</p>
<p>Life or finding meaning or both.</p>
<p>Yeah. We get caught up in, in, in the, it&rsquo;s easy to get easier to do the stuff that&rsquo;s immediate</p>
<p>and not through the stuff. It&rsquo;s not immediate.</p>
<p>So the big picture we&rsquo;re bad at.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense of what that big picture is?</p>
<p>Like why you ever look up to the stars and ask, why the hell are we here?</p>
<p>You know, my, my, my, my atheism tells me it&rsquo;s just random, but you know, I want to understand the,</p>
<p>the way random in the, in the, that&rsquo;s what I talk about in this book, how order comes from disorder.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But it kind of sprung up like most of the whole thing is random, but this, this, this,</p>
<p>the whole thing is random, but this little pocket of complexity they will call earth</p>
<p>that like, why the hell does that happen?</p>
<p>And, and what we don&rsquo;t know is how common that those pockets of complexity are or how often,</p>
<p>um, cause they may not last forever.</p>
<p>Which is, uh, more exciting slash sad to you if we&rsquo;re alone or if there&rsquo;s infinite number of.</p>
<p>Oh, I think, I think it&rsquo;s impossible for me to believe that we&rsquo;re alone.</p>
<p>Um, that would just be too horrible, too cruel.</p>
<p>It could be like the sad thing.</p>
<p>It could be like a graveyard of intelligent civilizations.</p>
<p>Oh, everywhere.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That might be the most likely outcome.</p>
<p>And for us too.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And all of this will be forgotten.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, including all the robots you build, everything forgotten.</p>
<p>Well, on average, everyone has been forgotten in history.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Most people are not remembered beyond the generation or two.</p>
<p>Um, I mean, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, not just on average, basically very close to a hundred percent of people who&rsquo;ve ever lived</p>
<p>are forgotten.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, long arc of, I don&rsquo;t know anyone alive who remembers my great grandparents</p>
<p>because we didn&rsquo;t meet them.</p>
<p>So still this fun, this, uh, this, uh, life is pretty fun somehow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Even the immense absurdity and, and, uh, at times, meaninglessness of it all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty fun.</p>
<p>And one of the, for me, one of the most fun things is robots.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve looked up to your work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked up to you for a long time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>God.</p>
<p>Rod, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s an honor that, uh, you would spend your valuable time with me today talking.</p>
<p>It was an amazing conversation.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for being here.</p>
<p>Well, thanks for, thanks for talking with me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Rodney Brooks.</p>
<p>To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with the three laws of robotics from Isaac Asimov.</p>
<p>One, a robot may not injure a human being or through inaction, allow human being to come to</p>
<p>harm. Two, a robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except when such orders</p>
<p>would conflict with the first law. And three, a robot must protect its own existence as long</p>
<p>as such protection does not conflict with the first or the second laws.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>
<p>I hope to see you next time.</p>
