    <p>The following is a conversation with Michael Mina, his second time on the podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a professor at Harvard doing research on infectious disease and immunology. In my view,</p>
<p>the most powerful, doable, and obvious solution to COVID 19 from the very beginning is rapid</p>
<p>at home testing. This is what Michael has been talking about and writing about since the beginning</p>
<p>of the pandemic. The accuracy of these tests is high for the task of detecting contagiousness,</p>
<p>which is what matters. Hundreds of millions can be manufactured quickly and relatively cheaply.</p>
<p>Privacy and individual freedoms are preserved. I believe that if you give people the power of</p>
<p>information, information about whether they are contagious or not, they will do the right thing</p>
<p>at scale, all while respecting their freedom and minimizing the destructive effects of the pandemic</p>
<p>on our health and our economy. The solution was obvious in May of 2020. It was obvious when Michael</p>
<p>and I spoke the first time a year ago, and it is obvious today. We talk about why it has not yet</p>
<p>been done and how we can still do it. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check</p>
<p>out our sponsors in the description. And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Michael Mina.</p>
<p>We spoke a year ago about rapid at home testing, and I think you think it should have been,</p>
<p>still should be a big part of the solution to COVID. So let&rsquo;s recap. Where do things stand</p>
<p>today in terms of rapid at home testing? Well, it&rsquo;s certainly something that you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>I do think we should have them today. We&rsquo;ve now had almost 20 months of living in anxiety,</p>
<p>uncertainty, being afraid for our health, for our family&rsquo;s health, for our friends, you know,</p>
<p>shutdowns, economic instability, everything has been uncertain because of this virus.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this little test, and it&rsquo;s the first time for many people that they&rsquo;re using it</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re feeling empowered. They&rsquo;re feeling like they can control their little slice</p>
<p>of this pandemic. So as these tests have come out and more and more and more Americans have</p>
<p>had an opportunity to go and buy them from, you know, CVS or Walgreens or wherever they&rsquo;re at,</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s really shifting the tenor of the discussion. For a long time, all of 2020,</p>
<p>it was like, I often felt like it was me and a few other people against the world, you know,</p>
<p>these tests should be public health tools, these tests are infectiousness indicators,</p>
<p>they shouldn&rsquo;t be compared to PCR, you know, all of these different things. And we could,</p>
<p>of course, go through and recap what the benefits and the metrics are that we should be looking at.</p>
<p>But the point is, last year and most of this year was about educating scientists, educating</p>
<p>public health leaders, educating physicians to get them to understand that there is a different</p>
<p>reason to test in a pandemic than purely diagnostics and transmission blockade and</p>
<p>severing transmission chains is a big one. So now, I think we&rsquo;re at a point where people</p>
<p>are now understanding and they&rsquo;re understanding because they are feeling it, they&rsquo;re holding it</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re doing it and they&rsquo;re seeing, they&rsquo;re feeling the delight of seeing a negative</p>
<p>and saying, I feel more comfortable. It&rsquo;s not perfect, but it&rsquo;s pretty darn close to perfect</p>
<p>to allowing me to go and see my mom without mistakenly infecting her, you know, or whatever</p>
<p>the story might be. And now that that&rsquo;s happening, I think all of a sudden we&rsquo;re seeing a massive</p>
<p>change politically for these tests. Biden just came out the COVID 19 action plan the other day</p>
<p>and one of the main pillars of it was testing and in particular, bringing rapid tests,</p>
<p>scaling them up. So on that front, I think finally there is success. People are actually understanding</p>
<p>and, you know, I haven&rsquo;t stopped beating this drum for far too long and I like hate rapid tests now.</p>
<p>So maybe it&rsquo;s good to step back. Would you say most Americans have not taken a rapid at home test?</p>
<p>Absolutely. Most have definitely not taken a rapid test. So like many of them probably don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>They kind of probably say testing, they have like memories of testing, like PCR testing,</p>
<p>they have to go into somewhere and they have to like a swab deep in their nose and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the experience. So maybe when, if you have to travel like Canada or something like that,</p>
<p>you have to get tested, that kind of stuff. So what are rapid at home tests?</p>
<p>Yeah. So the rapid at home tests are, I like to call them paper strip tests. They&rsquo;re simple tests</p>
<p>that, I wish I brought some today, but I didn&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re simple tests that you swab. At the moment,</p>
<p>most of them use a swab that you just swab the front of your nose. So it&rsquo;s not one of the deep</p>
<p>swabs that goes into your brain. And so it&rsquo;s not very uncomfortable. It&rsquo;s just like picking your</p>
<p>nose, if you will, and you put that swab into a little tube and the tube has some liquid in it.</p>
<p>And then you put a few drops of that liquid onto a paper strip or you drop the paper strip</p>
<p>into the tube, just like one of those indicators for the pool. And if you, just like a pregnancy</p>
<p>test, then if you get two lines, you&rsquo;re positive, one line, you&rsquo;re negative. It&rsquo;s super simple. It</p>
<p>takes 30 seconds, once you know how to do it, of hands on time. And you wait around 10 minutes,</p>
<p>and then you read the result. They are extraordinarily effective to answer one</p>
<p>question, am I infectious? And that is the public health question that we need to answer and</p>
<p>consistently ask during this pandemic. Are you infectious? Am I infectious? Because it&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>when we know that we&rsquo;re infectious that we can be empowered to not mistakenly infect others.</p>
<p>The PCR test is a little different. And we can go into the pros and cons, but one of the major</p>
<p>differences is that a PCR test gets a lot of&hellip; A lot of people talking about the PCR test say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>much more sensitive. And at an analytical level, it is. It can detect one molecule instead of</p>
<p>100,000. But for public health, we don&rsquo;t want a test that can detect one molecule. In fact,</p>
<p>that has created a net negative for public health. We just want to know, am I infectious?</p>
<p>And to know that question, to know if I&rsquo;m infectious, I only need a test that is going</p>
<p>to be positive if I have a high viral load, like a million. And the virus grows so fast,</p>
<p>it will grow from zero to a billion in a day. So you don&rsquo;t really need, even on the front end of an</p>
<p>infection, you don&rsquo;t need better sensitivity. If the trade off is that you don&rsquo;t get the result</p>
<p>for one, two or three days, you absolutely want a rapid result that can tell you, yes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re infectious, you&rsquo;re transmitting to others right now. And I&rsquo;m going to give you the result</p>
<p>right now. So it is a much more effective tool because it&rsquo;s fast, because it&rsquo;s accessible. We</p>
<p>can use them in the home. And there&rsquo;s some issues with using them at home. We can talk a little bit</p>
<p>about what those issues are, like reporting and how do you use everything on the honor system if</p>
<p>you have a test that you&rsquo;re taking at home and you use it to go to work. But they can be accessible.</p>
<p>PCR has to go into a lab. It takes a lot of time for somebody to get a PCR test. They either have</p>
<p>to go online and order it. It takes the next day for it to come back. They swab themselves,</p>
<p>they ship it out the next day, and then they get a result two days later. That&rsquo;s four days minimum</p>
<p>for the most part. And at that point, you&rsquo;re not even infectious, even if you did happen to be</p>
<p>infectious when you first ordered the test. So it&rsquo;s really the speed of these tests and the</p>
<p>accessibility and distribution of them that makes them so immensely powerful.</p>
<p>So you have this like amazing graphic you tweeted. It&rsquo;s exactly what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>which is rapid antigen test answers the question, am I currently infectious? And you have, I think,</p>
<p>a comparison of seven different tests based on the viral load. And based on the viral load across</p>
<p>these different tests, you look at the likelihood of infectiousness. So what does this graphic show?</p>
<p>We can overlay that for people. I think it&rsquo;s just really nice and really clear.</p>
<p>Yeah. So what that&rsquo;s showing is that we can never ask what&rsquo;s the sensitivity of a test and just let</p>
<p>that be the answer. That&rsquo;s what the FDA does currently. And that question doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>anything. We have to say, what is the sensitivity of the test to detect what? And so we can have</p>
<p>different viral loads. For example, you can have a viral load of one or you can have a viral load</p>
<p>of a trillion. And a PCR test will tell you that you are positive regardless of whether it&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>or a trillion. Now, so we can&rsquo;t ask the question, how sensitive is a rapid test compared to PCR?</p>
<p>Because that covers the whole gamut. What we really want to say is, how sensitive is the rapid test</p>
<p>to detect me if I am infectious? And that gets to about 97% or so sensitive. If the question is,</p>
<p>how likely is it to detect me if I&rsquo;m a super spreader? That&rsquo;s a really important one to be</p>
<p>able to detect. They&rsquo;re all about 100% sensitive. So if you have extraordinarily high viral loads</p>
<p>to the point where you might be a super spreader, these simple rapid tests will essentially always</p>
<p>catch you and tell you you&rsquo;re positive. And then as you go down the line, if you&rsquo;re no longer</p>
<p>infectious at all, then these rapid tests might have a 0% sensitivity compared to PCR.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s actually a good thing. The FDA and others look at it as though it&rsquo;s a bad thing</p>
<p>because they average it all together and say, oh, this is only a 40% sensitive test compared to PCR.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the right way to look at it. You want to say, well, out of all of the samples,</p>
<p>how many of them were not transmissible? How many were mid, moderate, high, extremely high,</p>
<p>super spreader? And you should at the very least create a weighted average based on</p>
<p>transmissibility potential. We don&rsquo;t do that. And that&rsquo;s why nobody in America has these tests,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re very rare. Because we have slowed down their authorization because of</p>
<p>that misunderstanding that they don&rsquo;t have to be 80% or 90% sensitive compared to any time PCR</p>
<p>positivity. They need to be 80% or 90% or more if you&rsquo;re infectious. And for that question,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like 95% up to 100% sensitive when you&rsquo;re most infectious.</p>
<p>So when you have a lot of virion particles in you, that&rsquo;s what it means when you say viral load,</p>
<p>that means you&rsquo;re going to be very infectious. The more you have, the more infectious you are.</p>
<p>And this test is basically very good at detecting when you&rsquo;re very infectious.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we have rapid at home tests? You said there&rsquo;s a bit of confusion. FDA is involved.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about, you continue to talk about that these at home tests are classified as,</p>
<p>I guess, medical devices. And so because of that, FDA is looking at them differently</p>
<p>than they probably should be looked at. So what&rsquo;s the problem here? Can you sort of explain</p>
<p>what does it mean to be a medical device? Why is that an issue? Where is the FDA messing up?</p>
<p>So when we declare something as a medical device and we evaluate as a medical device,</p>
<p>then it makes sense that the comparison, if you&rsquo;re trying to get a new one onto the market,</p>
<p>that the comparison would be against a gold standard medical device for that purpose.</p>
<p>So PCR is currently the gold standard, or at least in the eyes of the FDA,</p>
<p>the PCR test is the gold standard medical device. And that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s so sensitive.</p>
<p>As a physician, I have one patient in front of me at a time. And that patient comes to me and I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to care about the 99.9999% of people in the world who are not in front of me. I only</p>
<p>care about that one patient. And so when I get a sample from that patient and that patient&rsquo;s saying,</p>
<p>Doc, I don&rsquo;t feel well. I haven&rsquo;t been feeling well for the last few weeks. Do you think this</p>
<p>is COVID? Well, for that question, I want to have the absolute best sensitivity test,</p>
<p>regardless of what it means for transmissibility, because my patient isn&rsquo;t sitting in my office</p>
<p>saying, Doc, do you think I&rsquo;m infectious? They&rsquo;re saying, Doc, do you think I have recently been or</p>
<p>am infected? And these are totally different things. One is medicine. And if the patient&rsquo;s</p>
<p>infected, the time isn&rsquo;t of the essence because they&rsquo;re sitting there in my office. I can say,</p>
<p>look, I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re not feeling well. Let&rsquo;s get a PCR test on you. We&rsquo;ll be able to tell</p>
<p>you if you have any evidence that there has been recently an infection inside of you.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll get the results in a couple of days. And it might be expensive. And so insurance is</p>
<p>going to pay for it. And you&rsquo;re just one person. And so I don&rsquo;t really care how many resources it</p>
<p>takes to get you this answer. On the other hand, there&rsquo;s public health testing. And public health</p>
<p>testing has to account for all of the people you&rsquo;re not seeing as well as the person you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>testing at the moment. So accessibility becomes a central theme. Frequency of tests, it has to</p>
<p>account for all the days that you&rsquo;re not sitting there in front of your doctor&rsquo;s office getting a</p>
<p>test as well as the one you are. So it has to say how frequently. What if you&rsquo;re infected tomorrow,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re at the doctor&rsquo;s office today getting a negative COVID test? That PCR test at the doctor&rsquo;s</p>
<p>office today is going to do nothing to let you know that you get exposed and infected tomorrow.</p>
<p>The only way to know that is to be testing yourself frequently.</p>
<p>And the reason it matters is that these tests can be accessible if we are okay with saying</p>
<p>the real purpose of a public health test is to answer the question, am I infectious?</p>
<p>The reason we want to answer that is if you&rsquo;re infectious, that&rsquo;s when you isolate. We actually</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to isolate PCR positive individuals who are no longer infectious. That&rsquo;s bad public</p>
<p>health practice. If I haven&rsquo;t been infectious for three weeks, I don&rsquo;t want to have somebody tell</p>
<p>me that I need to go and isolate for 10 days just because I happen to use a PCR test today,</p>
<p>three weeks after I was infectious. And furthermore, I definitely don&rsquo;t want the public</p>
<p>health agency to come and round up all the people I was with last night and say, you guys have to</p>
<p>quarantine for 14 days because you were with Michael who wasn&rsquo;t infectious yesterday.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nonsensical to do that. And it&rsquo;s a huge disincentive to actually get tested. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exactly right. Huge disincentive to get tested. People, if it&rsquo;s too sensitive, especially with</p>
<p>flights, things like that, we shouldn&rsquo;t be stopping people from taking a flight if they haven&rsquo;t been</p>
<p>infectious for 60 days. And to be clear, people are only infectious for somewhere between three</p>
<p>and seven days, but can be positive on a PCR test for 30 to 70 days. So, I mean, it&rsquo;s potentially</p>
<p>a tenfold difference in terms of how long you&rsquo;re PCR positive versus how long you&rsquo;re infectious.</p>
<p>So, we don&rsquo;t want to be taking people during those 30 to 70 days and saying you need to isolate just</p>
<p>because you go and get a swab, or you can&rsquo;t go on your trip just because you had COVID last month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not good use of a test. So, the reason we don&rsquo;t have these tools right now is because</p>
<p>when we evaluate a rapid test as a medical device, the FDA says, well, this has to achieve</p>
<p>the properties that we expect from a medical device, which again, doesn&rsquo;t have to take time</p>
<p>into account, doesn&rsquo;t really have to take cost or resources or scalability or access into account.</p>
<p>It only takes sensitivity and specificity to catch molecules. And so, just by definition, I mean, it</p>
<p>is a mathematical fact, you know, that if you have a perfect public health test for COVID, which means</p>
<p>that it would be 100% sensitive and 100% specific for contagious people or for the infectious stage</p>
<p>of an infection, then it literally can&rsquo;t, it is an impossibility for that test to achieve an 80%</p>
<p>sensitivity at a population level against a medical device, which is what the FDA asks for.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re only infectious for maybe 20%. So, theoretically, it should only have</p>
<p>a 20% sensitivity against the PCR while still being a perfect medical, a perfect public health</p>
<p>test. And the test is answering the question, am I infectious? That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re testing for,</p>
<p>not for the exact counting of the virion particles in your system. That&rsquo;s exactly right. Okay. So,</p>
<p>why are we still here? So, have you had conversations with folks? You said that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of leaders that are kind of starting to wake up to this idea, but why is this taking this so</p>
<p>long? Why don&rsquo;t we still have hundreds of millions of at home tests? The reason it&rsquo;s taking long,</p>
<p>the reason it&rsquo;s taking long, I think, is because every agency and government is generally deferential</p>
<p>to the FDA. And in this context, I would argue that government hasn&rsquo;t been particularly creative.</p>
<p>So, for example, last year, when Trump was still president, I would, or in the transition,</p>
<p>and I recall talking to the White House a number of times and saying,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a plan to give us our lives back. I think that was actually the title of the Atlantic</p>
<p>article. And this plan can stop shutdowns, it can stop outbreaks, it can allow society to keep</p>
<p>running and could have prevented the outbreaks of last winter and fall and saved hundreds of</p>
<p>thousands of lives. So, when I bring that to the White House or to the government, the federal</p>
<p>government, whoever it might be, and I say, here&rsquo;s a plan, this would work. They say, what I get back</p>
<p>is, this sounds really interesting, Michael. It looks like it checks out. But there&rsquo;s one problem,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have the test, there&rsquo;s no scale. And that&rsquo;s kind of where it all dropped. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>this defeatist attitude of like, don&rsquo;t have the test, so we can&rsquo;t act on it. But now it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>changing. Well, and so that&rsquo;s really where things have been. And so nobody&rsquo;s paid attention. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always been this like esoteric thing that, yeah, maybe one day we&rsquo;ll get around to it, but really</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that important. And the pandemic&rsquo;s going away. But this was like 100% predictable, everything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening today. We predicted it last year. It&rsquo;s not, this isn&rsquo;t like rocket science or</p>
<p>anything. The variants and all those kinds of things. So the FDA, we can start to understand</p>
<p>why, but also like one question I want to ask, is it possible to go around the FDA?</p>
<p>Yeah. So why has the FDA not changed? And why has nobody tried to push the FDA to change?</p>
<p>I think what the real reason is the FDA has one job around these tests and it is to authorize</p>
<p>them as medical devices. They haven&rsquo;t been charged with doing anything else. So in their eyes,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing exactly what they&rsquo;re supposed to do. They&rsquo;re evaluating these tests as medical</p>
<p>devices and they&rsquo;re telling company after company after company, sorry, you don&rsquo;t make the cut.</p>
<p>And the only way to make the cut is really to kind of skew your clinical trials to favor</p>
<p>the rapid test being positive, which isn&rsquo;t really good practice. We shouldn&rsquo;t be trying to</p>
<p>skew clinical trials. But that&rsquo;s kind of what&rsquo;s happened. It&rsquo;s been forced upon the companies to</p>
<p>do that. And so I think the FDA truly believes from the bottom of their heart that they are</p>
<p>doing the right thing here. And I would argue that to an extent they are. I&rsquo;ve been pretty</p>
<p>hard on the FDA, but maybe the issue is a higher level issue. Like the in vitro diagnostics</p>
<p>division is they get applications and they evaluate them and the applications are for</p>
<p>medical claims. That&rsquo;s however, because there&rsquo;s been a misunderstanding of these tests and</p>
<p>the companies only know to apply for these as medical claims because there&rsquo;s nothing else in</p>
<p>this country to apply for except the medical claim. So we don&rsquo;t have a public health pathway</p>
<p>to evaluate a test and authorize a test. It doesn&rsquo;t exist. We have defunded and devalued</p>
<p>public health for so long that we literally don&rsquo;t have a language for it. We don&rsquo;t have laws,</p>
<p>a language, words. Is it called a public health test? Is it called something else?</p>
<p>I call it a public health test because I&rsquo;m trying to create a new definition here,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why nobody&rsquo;s acted because everyone says, well, there&rsquo;s no other pathway. So the FDA</p>
<p>in vitro medical diagnostics division is the only pathway. So what I am trying to do is to say, look,</p>
<p>the FDA very clearly states that they do not authorize or review public health tools</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t authorize or review public health tests for COVID. So what I want the president of</p>
<p>the United States to do is to utilize executive powers and take an executive action that can</p>
<p>simply state like one line. One line could potentially change all of this. And it&rsquo;s a pretty</p>
<p>obvious and simple line. And it is that any tools used for public health testing during this public</p>
<p>health emergency will be designated as public health tools. Like it&rsquo;s obvious, like it&rsquo;s public</p>
<p>health emergency. It&rsquo;s a tool used for public health that should be designated as a public health</p>
<p>tool. If we can do that, if we can get that language out there so that that&rsquo;s the president&rsquo;s</p>
<p>decision, then all of a sudden the FDA is off the hook. They&rsquo;re not trying to cram a square peg</p>
<p>through a round hole. They can say, look, the antigen tests are not on us anymore. At least if</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to be used for public health, like when you test a thousand people at a time or test</p>
<p>a school classroom if they&rsquo;ve been exposed, this is public health. And so then the CDC could take</p>
<p>it over. The CDC could say, okay, what are the metrics we are interested in? And they could say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re interested in a test that can catch you if you&rsquo;re infectious. So you want high viral load</p>
<p>detection. That&rsquo;s fast, that&rsquo;s scalable. And hey, if your test has been used in Europe for months</p>
<p>and has performed extremely well, then we&rsquo;ll give you a certificate by right immediately. And that</p>
<p>could actually get hundreds of millions of additional tests into the United States tomorrow.</p>
<p>So you need some kind of classification from an FDA or from somebody to call it a public health</p>
<p>tool in order for it to be manufactured. Is it possible to just go around all of this and just</p>
<p>for somebody to manufacture at scale tests? Well, if you did that and you just called them,</p>
<p>you put a claim on them that called them public health tools, the FDA has a very</p>
<p>weird view of this and they will tell you that it&rsquo;s illegal, that it&rsquo;s a crime.</p>
<p>Is there a way to say like Elon Musk did with the flamethrower, it&rsquo;s not a flamethrower?</p>
<p>Yeah. Believe me, I&rsquo;ve tried to think of all the different approaches. There&rsquo;s major</p>
<p>inconsistencies here. So it&rsquo;s not like we don&rsquo;t have a precedent for a public health test even</p>
<p>during this pandemic. There is a very strong precedent. Pooled testing, we have companies</p>
<p>like Ginkgo based out here in Cambridge that are working with 100 different labs around the country.</p>
<p>So that might mean like not a ton of quality control over those labs. I don&rsquo;t want to say</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m just saying the reality is if you&rsquo;re working with that many labs,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to say, they&rsquo;re running pooled testing of millions and millions and millions of kids.</p>
<p>So here you have a company that&rsquo;s testing in each pool five to 25 kids at a time,</p>
<p>millions of kids in a pretty distributed way across the country in all these different labs</p>
<p>and the FDA doesn&rsquo;t care at all. You don&rsquo;t need an EUA. It doesn&rsquo;t need a regulatory authority.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s collection on site. It&rsquo;s getting shipped to a lab. There&rsquo;s no oversight of it. So why does</p>
<p>that have no oversight but a rapid test for the exact same purpose? You&rsquo;re just giving people</p>
<p>immediate results instead of two day delayed pooled PCR results. So it&rsquo;s a much more effective tool.</p>
<p>Why is the rapid test used for the same purpose, not designated as a public health tool, but</p>
<p>requiring FDA authorization? It&rsquo;s a ridiculous reason and it&rsquo;s because the FDA says that if</p>
<p>a test, and this is actually CMS that says this and the FDA adopts it, if a test alters your</p>
<p>behavior, if you get a single result and it&rsquo;s going to alter your behavior, then that is a</p>
<p>medical device. But the thing that I find ridiculous is like, okay, but you can give a</p>
<p>pooled test that alters 25 people&rsquo;s behavior at once and that&rsquo;s not falling, like that&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>risky. One person turns positive in the pool and 25 people have to be quarantined.</p>
<p>And how do they evaluate the accuracy? So for people who don&rsquo;t know, pooled test</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re testing a small fraction of the people. And if one of them is positive,</p>
<p>then you basically say, we have to retest everybody in the pool.</p>
<p>Yeah. So you take, let&rsquo;s say you have a school and each classroom you might have 20 kids each swab</p>
<p>their nose in a classroom and all those swabs go into a single tube. And then you rinse that tube</p>
<p>out with some saline and you run a PCR test on that tube of 25 samples, 20 samples. And so if</p>
<p>that tube turns positive in the PCR test, then all 20 or 25 of those students are now having</p>
<p>to quarantine. And if there&rsquo;s no positive, then all 20 or 25 students are interpreting that their</p>
<p>result is negative. So it really is ridiculous decision by the FDA to say that if the test itself</p>
<p>only tests one sample at a time, it&rsquo;s medicine because it will tell you one person at a time,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re positive or if you&rsquo;re negative. But if you do it as a pool and you tell 25 people that</p>
<p>your pool was negative, then that&rsquo;s somehow different. That&rsquo;s public health, not medicine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no logic there. Was it just personalities and</p>
<p>accidents of history or something like that? For example, you talk about the public health</p>
<p>tools and CDC, you look at masks. So masks were decided to somehow be an effective tool</p>
<p>to help with the pandemic. So I&rsquo;m sure the evidence that was used there was probably not</p>
<p>as strong as the evidence supporting antigen rapid tests. I was very much reading a lot of research</p>
<p>on masks. It&rsquo;s tricky. It&rsquo;s really tricky to show how well they stop the transmission of a virus,</p>
<p>especially when you don&rsquo;t fully understand how the virus is transmitted or the viral load required,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff. But then the CDC pretty quickly decided masks or whatever,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some oscillations back and forth, but then they quickly decided, everybody decided</p>
<p>masks is a good tool. So masks being decided a good tool and then rapid antigen tests,</p>
<p>not a good tool. Is that just like certain personalities who didn&rsquo;t speak up in a meeting</p>
<p>or who did speak up in a meeting? Is this just like a weird roll of the dice or is there a</p>
<p>better explanation? I think it&rsquo;s somewhat of a roll of the dice, but I also think it&rsquo;s that testing.</p>
<p>So doctors don&rsquo;t pretend to really understand much about fluid dynamics and how well masks are</p>
<p>working. That&rsquo;s way out of their realm. Doctors do believe that they understand all aspects of</p>
<p>the tests. And so the greatest barriers to rapid tests being brought to market or being rolled out</p>
<p>heavily and supported as public health tools, the greatest barriers came from physicians saying,</p>
<p>hell no, we can&rsquo;t use a test that&rsquo;s not as sensitive as a PCR.</p>
<p>And look at what happens if you use this antigen test and not a PCR test. You get people who are</p>
<p>showing a positive on a PCR and negative on an antigen. And they just assume that that was a</p>
<p>false negative on the antigen. For public health, I would call it a false positive on the PCR test.</p>
<p>But this type of thinking literally does not exist in medicine. And I think the biggest problem here</p>
<p>is that we placed physicians in decision making power. When this pandemic hit, everyone called up</p>
<p>clinical laboratory folks and microbiologists and physicians to ask, well, what kind of test should</p>
<p>we use, that kind of thing. And there is no training in medical school for this kind of</p>
<p>public health work. You have to optimize on the right qualities of a test that have nothing to</p>
<p>do with medicine. And then sometimes, if not frequently, they&rsquo;re actually at odds. And I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>give an example why the physicians, you could see why the physicians would have been against it from</p>
<p>their perspective. And they say, if a physician is a TSA agent at the airport, you know, a TSA agent,</p>
<p>their role at any given time, and the role they think that the instruments need to play is I want</p>
<p>you to scan the bag as well as possible. This is the only bag that I&rsquo;m interested in at the moment.</p>
<p>And this is my lane, this is my bag. I want to make sure that my instrument&rsquo;s doing, I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>the crappy instrument in my lane, I want to make sure that I&rsquo;m doing everything I can. But what</p>
<p>those TSA agents don&rsquo;t have to worry about is, well, how many other instruments are there in this</p>
<p>airport? Is anyone getting through the lines here without going through security? The average TSA</p>
<p>agent doesn&rsquo;t have to worry about that. They literally have one job to do, and it&rsquo;s pay</p>
<p>attention to this lane. If there&rsquo;s a big gap in the security line and people are flowing through</p>
<p>without going through security, that&rsquo;s not on the TSA agent. That&rsquo;s not a big systematic problem of</p>
<p>that of the system. And we can&rsquo;t expect that TSA agent to have ever even thought about that. Like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not on them. They were trained to look at the bag. And that&rsquo;s kind of like physicians.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of like physicians. And probably some physicians will hear this and feel like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>insulting it. I don&rsquo;t mean to be likening the two professions or anything like that. But the point</p>
<p>is that a physician has one duty. Do no harm to this patient. Time is an of the essence. Scale,</p>
<p>how many tests can my hospital perform in a day? How many tests can my county or country perform</p>
<p>in a day? That&rsquo;s not a physician&rsquo;s training to think like that at all. And so what has happened</p>
<p>is doctors got on board early and said, oh, hell no. We&rsquo;ve seen these antigen tests before. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not particularly sensitive compared to PCR. And early in the pandemic, there was like pissing</p>
<p>matches between labs who had the most sensitive PCR. And it just distracted everything. I was</p>
<p>trying to say pretty early, like, we don&rsquo;t need sensitivity. We just need frequency. We just need</p>
<p>scale. We need to think differently because our only goal if we&rsquo;re doing frequent routine testing</p>
<p>of asymptomatic people is not medicine. It&rsquo;s to say, do you need to isolate now? And if you have</p>
<p>a PCR test that&rsquo;s taking three days to return and you&rsquo;re like, if I was currently spreading virus</p>
<p>before I walked in here and you handed me, this actually happened to me today when I walked into</p>
<p>Harvard. Today was my first day back into Harvard since February of 2020. I go in, I scan my badge</p>
<p>and they hand me a PCR tube and they say like, return this by noon or something before your work</p>
<p>day is done. And I&rsquo;m looking at it. I&rsquo;m like, what is this going to do? Like, what if I&rsquo;m super</p>
<p>spreader right now? You&rsquo;re giving me free reign to walk around and infect everyone in the school</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to give me my result to tell me I did that in two days from now? It doesn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>make sense. So who is supposed to be, so it&rsquo;s understandable that doctors kind of feel that way,</p>
<p>just like you said, do no harm. Who&rsquo;s supposed to care about public health? Is it the FDA? Is there</p>
<p>some other organization yet to be created? Is it like, just like with the military, the reason we</p>
<p>have civilian leadership when you talk about war, is it the president that&rsquo;s supposed to do like</p>
<p>override FDA, override doctors, override and basically politicians in representing the people</p>
<p>in the state of emergency make big public health decisions? Like who is supposed to do it? Besides</p>
<p>you on Twitter. It&rsquo;s like most people really thinking about solutions to COVID will mention</p>
<p>you or will mention this idea of rapid at home testing. And it&rsquo;s, you watch that happening,</p>
<p>this discussion that this is an obvious part of the solution and the solution is not happening.</p>
<p>So who is supposed to implement this idea? I think the CDC that it should start there.</p>
<p>Override the FDA? Well, I don&rsquo;t even think it needs to override it. And that&rsquo;s why I think</p>
<p>these should just be designated as a different tool so that the company is, it&rsquo;s not overriding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just saying, look, this isn&rsquo;t even, this isn&rsquo;t in your jurisdiction to the FDA. This is</p>
<p>just a public health tool. But the problem is the centers for Medicaid, Medicare services</p>
<p>designates any tool, just like FDA, they designate these as medical devices purely because they could</p>
<p>change somebody&rsquo;s behavior based on the result of one test. So to change that at this point,</p>
<p>unless you can get CMS buy in, you know, we don&rsquo;t have, there is no designation as a public health</p>
<p>tool, but the president can just say, these are public health tools. These are not to be</p>
<p>regulated as medical devices if their goal is not medicine, but public health.</p>
<p>And if he does it, he does have the authority to do that as president and to say, I&rsquo;m tasking the CDC</p>
<p>to certify these tests or, or authorize them for use in the United States. And, you know,</p>
<p>he has to say something like that. He can&rsquo;t come out and say, these are public health tools, have</p>
<p>free reign, just, you know, any company start, start shipping them in the US because that would</p>
<p>create pandemonium and we&rsquo;d have a lot of bad tests. But there&rsquo;s a lot of really good tests</p>
<p>out there. We just are taking like six to 12 months to run trials. They&rsquo;re failing because</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t keep up with PCR. And if the president were to do this, then the CDC could take it over</p>
<p>and they could say, okay, it&rsquo;s on us. We&rsquo;re going to decide. The UK actually did this. They,</p>
<p>early on, they said, okay, they laid out a very clear regimen. They said, this is how we are going</p>
<p>to evaluate rapid antigen tests because they&rsquo;re public health tools. They did it in a, in a domain</p>
<p>that was outside of their normal medical diagnostic regulatory agencies. And they, they literally just</p>
<p>had a very fast screening to say, what are the best tests? They went through a huge number of</p>
<p>different tests and they said, okay, these are the, this is the rank order of which tests are good,</p>
<p>which are bad, which are scalable, which are not. And they were able to start deploying them in</p>
<p>weeks, not years. So I think the CDC really needs to take charge. The problem is when it comes to</p>
<p>like law, if everyone currently perceives this as like fully within the domain of the FDA and they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never heard of such enough public health test idea enabling, but the, but the FDA itself has created</p>
<p>the idea by saying we don&rsquo;t regulate public health tools. So the word is out there. The FDA has said,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t regulate them. So that gives the president an opportunity to say, okay, these are</p>
<p>those, you know, these are public health tools by definition. And, and I do think that this is a kind</p>
<p>of a crisis and it&rsquo;s a crisis of testing, but it&rsquo;s also a crisis of like, really, we&rsquo;re going to go</p>
<p>through this whole pandemic and never figure this thing out. That&rsquo;s just really sad. You know, if we</p>
<p>get through this and don&rsquo;t figure out how to evaluate a rapid test. So how do vaccines</p>
<p>play with this? So one of the things that when people discuss solutions to COVID, there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>sense that once you have a vaccine COVID is solved. So how does that interplay? Like, why do we still</p>
<p>need tests if we have vaccines? Yeah, I actually wrote an op ed in New York times or Wall Street</p>
<p>Journal or something that was titled why we still need rapid tests with vaccines. And the real reason</p>
<p>is because we have evaluated our vaccines based on their ability to stop disease. In fact, most of</p>
<p>the trials didn&rsquo;t evaluate them based on their ability to stop transmission. They didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>evaluate that at all, no less put it as one of the metrics for authorization. And with a virus like</p>
<p>this, it would be a bit naive to think that it&rsquo;s really going to stop transmission well.</p>
<p>I think a lot of excitement happened right after the first clinical trials. And I&rsquo;m sure we were</p>
<p>talking about it when I was last here, I would imagine given the timing. But those first clinical</p>
<p>trials came out and everyone jumped for joy that these things were going to be the end to this</p>
<p>pandemic. But we had really short sighted vision there by not recognizing two main features. One is</p>
<p>that they might not stop transmission. Another, I guess three, another is that new variants might</p>
<p>come around that will break through the vaccine protective immunity. And the third is that we were</p>
<p>measuring the efficacy of these vaccines during the peak of their performance in the first few</p>
<p>months after people got vaccinated. And that gives a skewed view of just how effective these are going</p>
<p>to be long term. So what happened with the vaccines is that everyone got very comfortable,</p>
<p>including the CDC saying, if you&rsquo;ve been vaccinated, this is the end of the pandemic for</p>
<p>you. And let&rsquo;s keep it up. But then Delta comes along and waning immunity comes along. And both</p>
<p>of these things compound exactly as anticipated to get breakthrough cases. And unfortunately,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re seeing now is the CDC and the administration went so all in on saying that</p>
<p>breakthrough cases are rare, that transmission doesn&rsquo;t really happen if you&rsquo;re vaccinated</p>
<p>without great data, especially with Delta, that once people started seeing breakthrough cases,</p>
<p>they started interpreting that as a failure of the vaccine. The vaccines are still working to</p>
<p>keep people out of the hospital for the most part, but they&rsquo;re not working to stop transmission.</p>
<p>And if our goal is to stop transmission, which until we decide as a society that we have different</p>
<p>goals, like we&rsquo;re okay with people getting ill and letting transmission go because we don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to worry about it anymore. We&rsquo;re not there yet. So until we decide that we&rsquo;re not going to stop</p>
<p>transmission, we need other avenues besides the vaccine because it&rsquo;s not doing it. It also means</p>
<p>that herd immunity isn&rsquo;t going to happen. And unfortunately, as long as we keep letting spread</p>
<p>happen in the context of vaccinated people, we&rsquo;re kind of giving this virus a bootcamp</p>
<p>of exactly what it needs to do and mutate to get around our vaccine derived antibodies.</p>
<p>And that makes me very nervous. So the more we can do to stop spread</p>
<p>in the unvaccinated, in the elderly vaccinated, and in other people,</p>
<p>the better. We just should be focusing on that. So in your eyes, the solution would look like this.</p>
<p>You would make enough tests where every single person will get tested every single day?</p>
<p>I think that that would be&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to do that actually. I want to do a variation on that.</p>
<p>I think what we should do is have a dynamical testing program. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be</p>
<p>complicated. Every household has a box of tests in their cupboard. And if you haven&rsquo;t seen any</p>
<p>cases in your community for a long time, stop testing. Do wastewater testing to see if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>any RNA coming back. If you start to see RNA in the wastewater that represents the virus,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re still wanting to stop outbreaks, you say, hey, you know those tests that are in your</p>
<p>cupboards, households in this county, why doesn&rsquo;t each household or each person in each household</p>
<p>use one test per week? Can you start to just pause on that idea? That&rsquo;s really cool, the wastewater</p>
<p>testing. That&rsquo;s the thing? So you can get a sense of how prevalent the virus is in a particular</p>
<p>community by testing the wastewater? That&rsquo;s exactly right. And so the viral load associated,</p>
<p>the viral load that you can find in the community represents the prevalence of the virus in the</p>
<p>community, which is really quite nice. That&rsquo;s a nice way to paint like a map of the intensity</p>
<p>of the virus. Okay, so when it goes above a certain level, you can start doing much higher</p>
<p>frequency testing in each household. That&rsquo;s right. So I don&rsquo;t want people to be in testing purgatory,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s not what I want. I just want us to get through this damn pandemic. And so we can</p>
<p>monitor the wastewater or any other methods. We can monitor the hospitals and the clinics. And</p>
<p>if somebody does come in with COVID like symptoms, and then a few other people come in,</p>
<p>you realize, okay, we got spread happening in our community. Send out a text message,</p>
<p>put it on the news, put in the newspaper, whatever you need to do, tell people, tell families,</p>
<p>use your test. And if the cases get worse, because you&rsquo;re just doing it once a week,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not going to stop transmission, but it&rsquo;s going to enable you to identify where outbreaks</p>
<p>are happening. If you start to find outbreaks in pockets, then the rule is simply, okay,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s squash the outbreak real fast. So everyone in that area in certain zip code or whatever it</p>
<p>might be, test every two days for seven days or every day for seven days, and you&rsquo;ll get rid of</p>
<p>the outbreak. We can do that. And if you&rsquo;ve now gone, again, a week or two with no cases</p>
<p>identified, stop the testing again. That&rsquo;s the nice thing that everything changes when people</p>
<p>have the tests in their home. It becomes dynamic. It can become easy. You send a text message,</p>
<p>take your test today. If some people don&rsquo;t do it, that&rsquo;s fine. The only goal is to get R below one,</p>
<p>and you stop the outbreak. People think it has to be near perfect. I always hear people say,</p>
<p>oh, what if somebody doesn&rsquo;t use it? Or what if somebody lies? Well, you have 98% of people</p>
<p>testing or even 50%. That&rsquo;s a whole lot better. And another big difference that people, I think,</p>
<p>oftentimes have a problem wrapping their head around, especially to an extent physicians who</p>
<p>are used to different kinds of metrics, is that all we have to do to completely stop an outbreak</p>
<p>from spreading in a community is to get, for every 100 infected people, to get them to go on</p>
<p>and infect 95. Most people would say, oh my God, that&rsquo;s a horrible program. You&rsquo;re still letting</p>
<p>100 people go and infect 95 people. But for a virus like this, that&rsquo;s a massive public health</p>
<p>win. If you can get 100 people to infect 90, most people, doctors, I would say, like a lot of people</p>
<p>would say, that sounds like a failure, to be honest. But if you do that for multiple days in</p>
<p>a row, then in a couple of weeks, you&rsquo;ve gone from a big outbreak to a very, very small outbreak.</p>
<p>And on the other hand, if you don&rsquo;t do that, if you allow 100 people to just infect 140 people,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not doing the testing, then instead of having 20 people at the end of</p>
<p>those four weeks with the testing, you literally would have 600. Massive differences here.</p>
<p>The only goal then is to get R below one, have 100 people infect less than 100, and you stop the</p>
<p>outbreaks and everyone stays safe. From everything you&rsquo;ve seen, how cheap can these things get?</p>
<p>From like in the past year, in terms of the developments you&rsquo;ve seen with the various test</p>
<p>manufacturers, how cheap can it be to make a test, to manufacture a test? So there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>manufacturing process that could be 50 cents, maybe less. It&rsquo;s hard to really have eyeballs</p>
<p>inside these companies in terms of where they&rsquo;re producing them in China and Taiwan, a number of</p>
<p>other places. Some of them are produced here in the United States too, but 50 cents, say,</p>
<p>was a very, very reasonable, generous number for how much it costs per test.</p>
<p>You look at a place with high market competition that has actually authorized a lot of these tests</p>
<p>like Germany. Germany has 60, 70 some odd different companies of high quality rapid tests</p>
<p>authorized. You can go there and buy it for 80 cents, and they&rsquo;re still making a profit.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s extremely cheap. Market competition can drive these tests way down in terms of cost.</p>
<p>I think one of the most important features of a rapid test program is what do you do with the</p>
<p>result? Is it going to be used for you to gain entry to school or work? Is it going to be reported</p>
<p>to the public health agencies? All of these, the primary mode should be just get people tests,</p>
<p>but really if you&rsquo;re going to be using it for a workplace thing, like what Biden is now saying,</p>
<p>vaccinate or test, which is going to lead to a crisis if we don&rsquo;t fix this soon because we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have massive demand for testing in the next couple of weeks. But when he says that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s essentially saying, okay, companies need to make sure that their people are testing.</p>
<p>So are you going to base it on the honor system? I would say you probably would not base</p>
<p>testing on the honor system if it&rsquo;s like to take somebody who would otherwise be quarantined from</p>
<p>work in school. And so you can go to school as long as your test is negative. So test to stay</p>
<p>program is a big thing that I&rsquo;ve been pushing for and others have. Businesses bringing people into</p>
<p>work who need to test, they need to have verification, but they don&rsquo;t want to set up</p>
<p>nursing stations in their lobbies or in the school parking lot or whatever. Everyone&rsquo;s tired of that.</p>
<p>We need to bring the tests into the home, but that means we need the technology to enable it.</p>
<p>And so I was at a conference recently. Do you know Mike Milken? Milken Institute. He&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>wealthy billionaire, but he&rsquo;s done a lot of philanthropy and he has a conference to raise</p>
<p>money for prostate cancer research. I was at this conference recently, Francis Collins,</p>
<p>a number of other people were there. And every morning we all had to test in the morning,</p>
<p>which I thought was a great idea obviously before we walked into that conference. But you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to test there and they didn&rsquo;t base it on the honor system. Every morning I scanned a QR code on</p>
<p>the box and eMed, which is a service that provides test verification, popped up with a proctor right</p>
<p>on my phone or on my computer and said, okay, let&rsquo;s go through your tests. And they watch you,</p>
<p>they videotape you using the test. So it&rsquo;s all recorded. It&rsquo;s all a reportable type of test.</p>
<p>And at the end of it, just from your home, you don&rsquo;t actually see the proctor,</p>
<p>you know, but they&rsquo;re just verifying that you actually do it. They verify the test,</p>
<p>they verify the test results with you. And at the end of it, you&rsquo;ve then gotten</p>
<p>from your couch or from your car, wherever you are, an actual verified laboratory report that</p>
<p>can be considered proof that you yourself use the test and you yourself got a negative.</p>
<p>So the tools are out here if we want to use them at scale. And in fact, the CDC uses eMed now to</p>
<p>enable people to come back into the United States through an antigen test. So before you get on your</p>
<p>flight, you&rsquo;re sitting in the airport in Heathrow or wherever you are, you can get on your computer,</p>
<p>use your eMed test, and you get the negative and CDC will accept that, TSA will accept you to come</p>
<p>back into the US with a rapid antigen test that you did without anyone else watching,</p>
<p>except for this proctor on your phone. Super simple.</p>
<p>How much private information is being collected? So like this, you know, people have in the United</p>
<p>States, the American way, they have a hesitancy on the overreach of government in things like</p>
<p>vaccine passports, like using any mechanism of verification that&rsquo;s controlled by government</p>
<p>can lead to overreach by said government. So there&rsquo;s a concern of that. Do you see there a way</p>
<p>of achieving testing that&rsquo;s verified but does not violate people&rsquo;s privacy or sense of freedom?</p>
<p>Absolutely. I think so. The way that right now in the United States, they&rsquo;re requesting that</p>
<p>these tests get, that the results get delivered to public health agencies. But I&rsquo;ve long held that</p>
<p>while that&rsquo;s ideal, it should never be the thing that holds up somebody being allowed to know their</p>
<p>own status. But if you are going to work and you have to let your boss or your manager, whomever,</p>
<p>know that you were negative that day, or if you&rsquo;re going to school, I think it&rsquo;s going to be hard to</p>
<p>maintain complete privacy in that situation because they need to know your name. But sure, I mean,</p>
<p>could you cut off the public health reporting? Yes, you could. But I worry, I mean, can you opt</p>
<p>out? Maybe you could opt out. That should be a feature. I want to opt out of the public health</p>
<p>reporting because for whatever reason, otherwise I&rsquo;m not going to do the test. But that means that,</p>
<p>okay, then you&rsquo;re not going to go to work. So right now there&rsquo;s this serious tension and</p>
<p>I am very uncomfortable with the idea that we force anyone to do anything. But there is a tension</p>
<p>between these two things for sure. And how do you balance that during a public health emergency?</p>
<p>I think first and foremost, let people, everyone has a right to know their status.</p>
<p>Right. The fact that we have made it hard for people</p>
<p>to know their status on their terms, I think is a travesty. I mean, it&rsquo;s just so</p>
<p>terrible that we have prioritized us knowing at the expense of you. Essentially what public health</p>
<p>has long said during this pandemic is, if I&rsquo;m public health, if I can&rsquo;t know, then you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know your status. That&rsquo;s not the right way to look at public health. We need to engage the public.</p>
<p>And if some of them don&rsquo;t want to participate in the public health part, but want to know</p>
<p>their status, by default, they are participating in public health, whether they know it or not,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not going to go get their mom sick by mistake. At least most people wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And then also you can create systems where you can, individuals can form</p>
<p>relationships based on their status without ever reporting it to a centralized place.</p>
<p>So you can go to, I don&rsquo;t know, a local business owner might require that you show</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re negative, but that doesn&rsquo;t require reporting it. You can, like there might be</p>
<p>basically like an ID that&rsquo;s only in possession, you are the only person in possession of that.</p>
<p>So you literally show it, here&rsquo;s a test I took, it&rsquo;s negative and nobody else knows about that test.</p>
<p>So that could very well be done, even through a company like eMed. I think, and I might be wrong</p>
<p>here, I believe that they take the test result, and because they are considered a CLIA waived</p>
<p>laboratory, like a digital laboratory, they report their results by law out to the public health</p>
<p>agencies. But let&rsquo;s say there was something a little different. Let&rsquo;s say you were verifying</p>
<p>an over the counter test, and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a CLIA waive because it&rsquo;s over the counter,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re not bound by CLIA rules. And you could create the same service, but that just doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>report out to the public health agencies. It gives people the option to opt in or out of public</p>
<p>health reporting. And I know that public health people get a little queasy when I talk about this,</p>
<p>but as a public health person myself, I guess of course I would prefer that the data be available</p>
<p>to evaluate to know where the cases are. But first and foremost, I want to make sure that the people</p>
<p>using the test are going to use the test. And if that means that they&rsquo;re not reporting, and if</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only way that they will use it is if it&rsquo;s not reported, then that&rsquo;s better than no test.</p>
<p>Especially given that the central to the vaccine hesitancy is a distrust of authority and the</p>
<p>distrust of government. So you&rsquo;re asking people to get tested and report their status</p>
<p>to a centralized authority when they clearly do not trust that authority. It doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense. It seems like a perfect solution to let people who are hesitant on the vaccine</p>
<p>to get their own status and have full control of that information and opt in,</p>
<p>provide that information if they wish to, but they have the full control of it and have the</p>
<p>freedom to do that information what they want. I fully agree with that. I really do. I think</p>
<p>we can have the verified services and we could have the privacy if you want it. If you need to</p>
<p>go into a restaurant and there&rsquo;s a rule that you have to be a negative test, have it on your phone</p>
<p>and only your phone. And it&rsquo;s okay. Like emails you the lab report, you have it. You can say,</p>
<p>look, that&rsquo;s my name. I used it this morning. Negative. And in that case, you&rsquo;d want something</p>
<p>that just is there and is not going anywhere else. And I think that those services, I think they can</p>
<p>exist. And it&rsquo;s a struggle because for those companies, they don&rsquo;t want to fall out of favor</p>
<p>with the CDC or with the FDA. And so this is a big problem in our marketplace in general by having</p>
<p>private companies who want to be the public health agents of this pandemic. We lose a lot of control</p>
<p>because the companies ultimately have to do what&rsquo;s going to make them money so they survive and keep</p>
<p>performing the service. It&rsquo;s really just such a hard problem. And this is why last time I was here,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing I was probably really pushing for the government to be producing these tests. I think I</p>
<p>would have still been pushing for that. At this point, I&rsquo;ve decided, okay, the government&rsquo;s clearly</p>
<p>not going to do that. I&rsquo;ve been thinking, I really want Elon Musk to produce the tests. I really am</p>
<p>sort of serious that these tests are simple to make, but we&rsquo;ve been using machines to make them</p>
<p>that have been around for a long time. Scale is an issue right now, kind of. Really, it&rsquo;s the EUA</p>
<p>process and getting the companies to be allowed to market in the US that&rsquo;s the issue. But let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just say scale is the issue. And one company wants to make 20 million tests a day. These aren&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>hard. We should be able to do that. We just need a faster machine, a better machine, and a quicker</p>
<p>one. And there&rsquo;s a few folks, like you mentioned, know how to solve that problem. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of</p>
<p>discussion with Tesla folks and know with people that used to work at Tesla, like Jim Keller,</p>
<p>about how to make stuff much cheaper, much better. That&rsquo;s basically what Tesla is world class at.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, does this thing have to cost $1,000? No, it can cost $10. And let&rsquo;s figure out</p>
<p>how to manufacture it. Those folks are like the best in the world at doing that. Okay, but what</p>
<p>about this Biden action plan? So it sounds like the guy agrees with you, vaccinate or test. So</p>
<p>I think given that choice, a lot of people go test in America because there&rsquo;s like a division,</p>
<p>it seems like. So is this just politics? Is this just words? Or do you think this is actually</p>
<p>going to lead to something? And maybe can you explain what the action plan is?</p>
<p>Sure. So there&rsquo;s a number of pillars to the action plan. The two that I&rsquo;ve been most focused on,</p>
<p>I mean, some of them are we want to get everyone vaccinated. We want to get everyone vaccinated.</p>
<p>All these things. And one pillar is saying any company in the United States that has</p>
<p>more than 100 employees is now required to ensure that any unvaccinated individuals in their workforce</p>
<p>test weekly. Another pillar is that the president&rsquo;s going to reduce the cost of PCR tests.</p>
<p>By 35%, which is pretty moderate reduction. And is going to reduce the cost of antigen tests</p>
<p>and scale them up and make 280 million tests and put $2 billion into it.</p>
<p>So those are the two that I found most intriguing for the kind of mission that I&rsquo;ve been on, which</p>
<p>is to just educate people around, hey, we have really, really powerful products that we can</p>
<p>educate people around. Hey, we have really, really powerful public health tools we have yet to deploy.</p>
<p>The issue at hand though, is that now that the president has said vaccinate or test,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a problem inherent in that. It&rsquo;s essentially to coerce people around vaccinated</p>
<p>to get vaccinated. Because vaccinate or test doesn&rsquo;t make sense when the vaccinated people</p>
<p>can transmit the virus just fine. It should be vaccinate and test.</p>
<p>Exactly. The problem that I have with that vaccinate or test idea is it&rsquo;s great if you</p>
<p>want to use it as a coercive effort to get people vaccinated. I&rsquo;m not going to wade into that</p>
<p>argument. Do I agree with it or not? I&rsquo;m just not going to even put my words under.</p>
<p>I disagree with it. Let me say, I disagree. As opposed to doing great science communication,</p>
<p>this weird, people talking down to the populace as if they&rsquo;re children trying to trick them.</p>
<p>Here, have some candy. Everyone with common sense. Somebody told me I was having a conversation.</p>
<p>If the government is going to give you money to take the vaccine,</p>
<p>people that were already hesitant about the vaccine are not going to trust whatever the</p>
<p>heck you&rsquo;re doing. Don&rsquo;t trick people into taking the vaccine. Be honest and communicate</p>
<p>transparently everything that&rsquo;s known about the vaccine. Communicate the data. Inspire people with</p>
<p>transparency and real communication of all the uncertainty around it and all the difficult</p>
<p>decisions of risk and all those kinds of things. As opposed to trying to trick them like children</p>
<p>into taking the vaccine anyway. Yes. Okay. Well, I didn&rsquo;t have to say that.</p>
<p>So there we go. But you&rsquo;re saying it should not be like vaccinate or test. That tradeoff</p>
<p>does not make sense. Exactly. By saying vaccinate or test is absolutely confusing</p>
<p>because it implies for anyone who&rsquo;s thinking about it, it is implying. And I&rsquo;ve seen this</p>
<p>because I have business leaders call me, Fortune 500 business leaders who call me and say,</p>
<p>what do I do? I have 8,000 employees. Where am I going to get my tests? And a lot of people are</p>
<p>saying, they&rsquo;re calling this a pandemic of the unvaccinated. These types of divisive language</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t help. This isn&rsquo;t a pandemic of the unvaccinated. This is a pandemic of a fucking</p>
<p>virus. Don&rsquo;t ever put it on the unvaccinated who frankly are just scared. They don&rsquo;t know who to</p>
<p>trust. And we haven&rsquo;t given them a lot of reason to trust public health, to be frank. So I agree.</p>
<p>I mean, now that you&rsquo;ve opened the door, I&rsquo;ll just say my piece. Absolutely, we need to be the most</p>
<p>honest we can with all of this. This is confusing language to say vaccinate or test. We need to be</p>
<p>very upfront and say, look, vaccines aren&rsquo;t stopping transmission very well. Unfortunately,</p>
<p>this is the world we have. We have Delta. We&rsquo;re going to have new mutants. We have a vaccine that</p>
<p>wanes somewhat over time. This is biology. I&rsquo;m sorry. This is just what it is. And then we say,</p>
<p>but the vaccines are really protective for your personal health. They&rsquo;re going to keep you out of</p>
<p>the hospital. This is what you should care about as an individual. And as a population,</p>
<p>we need to figure out, okay, we have to stop transmission if that&rsquo;s our goal.</p>
<p>So we should use the tools that are going to stop transmission if that&rsquo;s our goal. And saying</p>
<p>vaccinate or test, if our goal is to actually stop transmission, that&rsquo;s confusing because vaccines are</p>
<p>not stopping it. There may be mildly lowering the risk of transmission. So I&rsquo;m just not a fan of that</p>
<p>language. I think we should be being very, very clear, like you said, and upfront about what are</p>
<p>the limitations of the vaccine and of the test. And we should be very clear that it can only help.</p>
<p>The American public in aggregate is extremely intelligent. They will figure out when you say</p>
<p>that vaccine breakthrough cases are rare, and then they start seeing story after story of whole</p>
<p>parties of people who are vaccinated have outbreaks. And everyone knows more people now</p>
<p>who are having breakthrough cases than they knew who had regular cases before the vaccine.</p>
<p>People start to wonder, hmm, well, this is weird. They say that the vaccines are working,</p>
<p>breakthrough cases are rare. Maybe the whole vaccine program is failing entirely.</p>
<p>And so it ends up shooting ourselves in the foot if we try to create false expectations,</p>
<p>because we think it&rsquo;s going to be beneficial for one thing when it&rsquo;s not for the other.</p>
<p>And so to get back to the action plan, vaccinate or test, I think, and the increase in rapid tests,</p>
<p>I do think it was a bold move. I would say that it was the most prominent sort of display,</p>
<p>encouraging display of the fact that rapid tests are indeed effective public health tools.</p>
<p>My real concern now is that 280 million tests, that&rsquo;s like less than one per person per year</p>
<p>in the United States. So that&rsquo;s not the way that he said and delivered it. And what most people</p>
<p>think of when they hear the word 280 million, you don&rsquo;t usually put a lot of thought into,</p>
<p>what does that number mean? It sounds a big number. Most people are now going to be expecting</p>
<p>that these tests are actually going to be staying in stock on the shelves at CVS and Walgreens and</p>
<p>Amazon or whatever. So that&rsquo;s crisis number one is like, now the expectation is set for having rapid</p>
<p>tests, but they&rsquo;re not going to scale that well. We won&rsquo;t have them. And then there&rsquo;s vaccinate or</p>
<p>test. And that&rsquo;s going to bring millions and millions of people who are not currently testing</p>
<p>to have to start testing. So that&rsquo;s going to overwhelm our PCR labs. And it&rsquo;s going to create</p>
<p>five day delays again with PCR, if not longer, because we&rsquo;ll have backlogs. And so the only real</p>
<p>solution to this is to just scale up the tests that are actually scalable. And that&rsquo;s the simple</p>
<p>rapid tests. And it&rsquo;s not even to scale them up through production and manufacturing here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to open the doors so that the companies that already exist here and can scale are allowed to do</p>
<p>it and to bring in the international market. Some of the biggest diagnostic companies in the world</p>
<p>are not selling their millions and millions and millions of tests in the billions of tests in the</p>
<p>United States because they don&rsquo;t want to play the game that the FDA is currently requiring of them.</p>
<p>So we have an opportunity and I am very encouraged that the president actually did put these into the</p>
<p>action plan. And I do want to say for the record that I&rsquo;m supportive of it in principle. But I</p>
<p>think now we actually are in the time where it has been set and we have to deal with the crisis before</p>
<p>it happens. Otherwise, there could be some real political points taken off. I do worry that the</p>
<p>president, if he doesn&rsquo;t pull through with this and really make the tests available and we end</p>
<p>up getting into this other test crisis this fall, there could be political consequences to that.</p>
<p>And the reason is these rapid tests are so personal, they become emotional almost.</p>
<p>They give people that empowerment that I was talking about earlier. And when people can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>that because the shelves are out of stock, they actually feel frustrated and then that converts</p>
<p>into anger and blame. And so I do think that we have to be really smart about making a policy</p>
<p>like this and then ensuring that we can carry through with what the average American is actually</p>
<p>expecting. And speaking of politics, one of the great things about testing, maybe you can correct</p>
<p>me, but from my sense, it&rsquo;s one of the only solutions to COVID that has not yet been politicized.</p>
<p>So masks and vaccines, whether you like it or not, have been heavily politicized where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>literally a red blue split on the use of those or like proud use, effective use of those tools.</p>
<p>And it seems like everybody I talked to about testing, everybody&rsquo;s on board, red or blue.</p>
<p>They are, which is why I am particularly concerned about the vaccinate or test policy.</p>
<p>Because all of a sudden we just politicized it. We just</p>
<p>brought it with this thing that was fully bipartisan, really bipartisan. I mean, I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>talked to the fully, the really right side of Congress and the super liberal side of Congress,</p>
<p>the Senate, the same politicians, governors everywhere in this country have asked me for</p>
<p>support around these rapid tests because it&rsquo;s just, you can have it reported or not. You can</p>
<p>have it in the home, in the privacy of your own home or not, or you do it at school.</p>
<p>And these tools are just so powerful to identify infectious people. They didn&rsquo;t have to be</p>
<p>politicized. They still don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t think that the action plan went so far that it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>politicize them. But I do think already it&rsquo;s starting to conjure up emotion saying, well,</p>
<p>now I have to get tested. The have to part, right. And that is where we go wrong. I have to get</p>
<p>we go wrong. I have to get tested or vaccinated. Screw that. I am independent, whatever. And</p>
<p>I do worry that this thing that was purely bipartisan, that we could have just scaled</p>
<p>up months ago. People would have, we could have delivered it to every household. Didn&rsquo;t even have</p>
<p>to ask people to request it. Just delivered packages to every home in America by now easily.</p>
<p>And if we were smart about it, you know, we could have done it. The most unpleasant thing about</p>
<p>COVID is the uncertainty. And that&rsquo;s what leads to fear on both the vaccine hesitant,</p>
<p>is the uncertainty about the vaccine and people who have taken the vaccine, the uncertainty around</p>
<p>like, am I in danger walking around? Can I go, can I walk down the hall? Like this fear of the world</p>
<p>around you. And I think testing allows you to remove a lot of that uncertainty. Like you,</p>
<p>you gain back confidence that you can operate in this world and not get infected and you become</p>
<p>like a nicer person. I find myself every time I get tested, I become a nicer person to others</p>
<p>because I know I&rsquo;m not putting them in danger. I&rsquo;m not putting people in danger.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a heavy burden to carry to worry. Am I infectious? Like I was out last night,</p>
<p>but I do want to go see my mom today, you know, like, am I infectious? I don&rsquo;t know. And this has</p>
<p>created massive anxiety and I can&rsquo;t, I completely agree that it is, it&rsquo;s a relieving feeling and,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an amazing feeling to be in a room when, and I did this in the middle of the pandemic when</p>
<p>everyone was supposed to be wearing a mask indoors and everyone rapid tests, you know, and I said,</p>
<p>everyone should rapid test before you walk into this room. And it was a wonderful experiment</p>
<p>because everyone was just so relaxed. You know, the other, the alternative is everyone, nobody</p>
<p>tests and everyone wears a mask. You have a mask that maybe gives you 20% maybe protection during,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re all in the same room together, if that, or you have a rapid test program where everyone</p>
<p>rapid test before, and that gives you like 95% to a hundred percent protection, not a hundred</p>
<p>percent, but close. And all of a sudden that allows everyone to take a big sigh and be like,</p>
<p>wow, this is the first time I&rsquo;ve seen people without masks indoors in a long time. And I feel</p>
<p>pretty good. And restaurants, like restaurants are scary right now because you just don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>who might be infectious and nobody&rsquo;s masked. And like, wouldn&rsquo;t it be great to just go into</p>
<p>a restaurant where you know that everyone just tested negative that day? It just really reduces</p>
<p>anxiety. It makes individuals feel empowered. And I mean, at the end of the day, COVID and</p>
<p>our response to COVID is a, it&rsquo;s truly an information problem. You know, why do we</p>
<p>quarantine anyone? Why did we ever close anything down? We didn&rsquo;t close things down because everyone</p>
<p>is positive. We closed things down because we didn&rsquo;t know if anyone was positive. We quarantine</p>
<p>a whole classroom of kids, not because they&rsquo;re all positive, but because we don&rsquo;t know if one</p>
<p>of them are positive. And so we just quarantine everyone when there&rsquo;s a positive in the case,</p>
<p>in the, in the classroom, like one day, we&rsquo;ll then ask the whole classroom not to come to school for</p>
<p>10 days. That&rsquo;s not a biological problem. That&rsquo;s an information problem. And the crazy thing is we</p>
<p>have the tool to solve that information problem. It&rsquo;s literally our eyes on the virus. It&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>we see this virus. And if everyone glowed green, when they were infectious, we would have never</p>
<p>had to close down anyone, any society. And we would have never had the outbreaks because we</p>
<p>would have been able to stay away from the green people, you know? And yeah, I like what you said,</p>
<p>the quarantine is an information problem. That&rsquo;s absolutely right. What, is there something you</p>
<p>can say to what people can do, like listening to this, individuals? Do you just complain like</p>
<p>loudly? Like, why can&rsquo;t we do this? Can you speak with your money somehow? What, what can people do</p>
<p>to help? God, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s amazing to think you&rsquo;re asking me this question and this video will go</p>
<p>out to, you know, the web and all the people that watch you. And last year in July, maybe</p>
<p>something like that, June, I forget exactly when it was, I was on Twiv this week in virology.</p>
<p>Shout out to Twiv. Those guys are awesome. They are awesome. I love, I love Twiv.</p>
<p>And they asked me the exact same question towards the end. They said, this makes so much sense. You</p>
<p>know, why wouldn&rsquo;t we do this? What can people do? And so I said, oh, you know, just send me an email,</p>
<p>like write to me. I&rsquo;m sure you could find my email somewhere online and get in touch and I will,</p>
<p>you know, and we can try to figure out how to make something happen. Bad idea.</p>
<p>Very smart.</p>
<p>Way too many emails. I didn&rsquo;t, I feel bad because I didn&rsquo;t end up getting back to anyone because I</p>
<p>just got inundated. But it did lead to the development of rapidtest.org where we did</p>
<p>automate the process of writing letters to congressional members and elected representatives.</p>
<p>So that helps. Fast forward to today. What can, what can people do? I honestly don&rsquo;t know. Like,</p>
<p>what can the average person at this point do? We have tried everything. The FDA is immutable on</p>
<p>this. They will not change and we shouldn&rsquo;t ask them to change because they have decided that this</p>
<p>is how they regulate medical devices and they&rsquo;re going to stick to it. So what we need to do,</p>
<p>what we need to do, and maybe this is something to do, is get, if you know people who have sway</p>
<p>over politicians, lobbyists, whatever it might be, let people know to request that the president,</p>
<p>literally the president of the United States, uses executive powers to just do a simple,</p>
<p>something as simple as designating these powerful public health tools as public health tools.</p>
<p>Allow the CDC and the NIH or whomever it must be or academic centers of excellence designated by</p>
<p>the CDC to evaluate the tests in a very fast fashion with the appropriate metrics that these</p>
<p>tests need to achieve for public health. And within two days we can have 10 new tests authorized.</p>
<p>You know, this doesn&rsquo;t have to be a six to 12 month endeavor. This could be a two day</p>
<p>endeavor. We actually did it. I judged the rapid test XPRIZE and it went great. We actually got</p>
<p>incredible metrics about how well does each test work and no clinical trials, you know,</p>
<p>just a couple days worth of work in the lab and boom. And if we actually systematize it,</p>
<p>it would be an hour or so in the lab. You know, so simple. So I don&rsquo;t know. I mean,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to really impact change. Thankfully, you know, I have a platform and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been able to start talking with people who are very close to the President and the White</p>
<p>House. And I do think that some change is finally happening because the silver bullet of the vaccine</p>
<p>has not panned out to be the silver bullet. So now we got to now I think we&rsquo;re moving from a country</p>
<p>that was a vaccine only approach to finally recognizing at the highest levels that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other tools. Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to reopen fully without solving the testing problem</p>
<p>completely? Like, do you think this vaccine approach will get us to reopen fully? I do.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think over time, though. I mean, if we a lot of people ask me, like, what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>happening? Like, what&rsquo;s the end game here? Like, where does this end? And it&rsquo;s actually not a</p>
<p>mystery. The end game is we will grow out of this virus. And by that, I mean, you and I</p>
<p>and most people who are watching this are adults, right? Adults don&rsquo;t like to get infected with a</p>
<p>virus for the very first time as adults. Babies are OK with it. And so what we have to do to</p>
<p>understand how we&rsquo;re getting out of this virus is to look at babies like at newborns and say, OK,</p>
<p>how does a baby get out of their high risk time period? They get exposed. They get exposed multiple</p>
<p>times or vaccinated, of course. And eventually they get exposed enough that they build up this</p>
<p>nice cushion of immunity that&rsquo;s sufficiently diverse that they can battle whatever gets</p>
<p>thrown at them because they&rsquo;ve seen it all already. But one exposure doesn&rsquo;t do it. I mean,</p>
<p>over the course of the first few years of life, kids get exposed to coronaviruses tons of times,</p>
<p>lots of different viruses they get. So unfortunately, what&rsquo;s happening with us,</p>
<p>why this is so bad for us, is that as we&rsquo;re adults, we don&rsquo;t regenerate tissue very well.</p>
<p>We have like overabundant inflammatory response. We have all these problems that when we get an</p>
<p>infection for the first time, it sucks. It harms us. It causes us problems. But over time, just</p>
<p>like a baby, we&rsquo;re going to start building up our immunity through vaccines and exposures.</p>
<p>And I hate to say it, but tons of people are getting exposed to Delta right now who don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know it. Tons. And if you&rsquo;re vaccinated, you don&rsquo;t know it, is my point there. And at the end of the</p>
<p>day, this is actually, I do not want this to be misconstrued as like saying, go get infected.</p>
<p>But the fact that people are getting infected will add to our level of protection later on.</p>
<p>And so&hellip; Yeah, but the question is how long that whole process takes. I think, you know,</p>
<p>my guess is probably by the end of next year, early 2023, we will probably start looking at</p>
<p>this as though it is not a particularly dangerous virus for most people. The elderly though,</p>
<p>it will still be, but that&rsquo;s because their immunity&hellip; Variants and stuff. And I&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>other people say the statement you just said a year ago about the spring, right? Well, that</p>
<p>probably was not wise. Well, I mean, it&rsquo;s because the intuition is like, okay, now that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>vaccine, you&rsquo;re either going to take the vaccine or get infected and then there&rsquo;ll be herd immunity</p>
<p>over, like it&rsquo;ll be very quick. So, you know, that&rsquo;s the intuition, but it seems like that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>happening. It seems like we&rsquo;re in this constant state of fear mongering for different reasons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like the virus got deeply integrated, not into just our biology, but</p>
<p>in the game of politics and in the fear mongering around the news because the virus now started</p>
<p>being together with the vaccine and the masks and it started getting integrated into the division</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s so effective at monetizing social media, for example. And so it&rsquo;s like, all right,</p>
<p>so how do you get out of that? Because you can always kind of present certain kinds of numbers</p>
<p>about number of cases or how full hospitals are and start making claims about that we&rsquo;re still,</p>
<p>this is as bad as it&rsquo;s ever been, those kinds of statements. And so I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what the</p>
<p>way out is except the same way out as it was originally, which is testing is information.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s information.</p>
<p>Yeah. And I think we can do that. We can keep outbreaks suppressed with testing because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>information. Like people keep thinking of tests as being medical things. They&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re information. It can allow us to control things. Just like we drive down a road and we</p>
<p>look at the cars and we don&rsquo;t hit other cars because we have the information that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in the lane next to us and they&rsquo;re moving over. That&rsquo;s just information.</p>
<p>Like you said, glow green. The problem with the virus, you don&rsquo;t see. You&rsquo;re walking around</p>
<p>and everybody is a potential infectious creature. And so if you see the world as a potential for</p>
<p>infection, you&rsquo;re going to be terrified of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right. And that is what has happened. And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been pushing so</p>
<p>hard for these tests because they can allow people, if you use them at a community level,</p>
<p>you can have enough people know that they&rsquo;re positive, enough people are good people that</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t go out and infect others. And the other great thing about them is again,</p>
<p>a 10 day isolation period, especially for a vaccinated person, but in either case,</p>
<p>is also an information problem. We don&rsquo;t have to isolate for 10 days if we&rsquo;re infected. What if</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re only infectious for two, especially if we&rsquo;re vaccinated? Why are we telling people the only</p>
<p>reason the CDC ever and the WHO ever suggested a 10 day isolation or a 14 day quarantine is because</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t know when people stopped being infectious. There&rsquo;s actually some people stay infectious for</p>
<p>14 days. It&rsquo;s rare. But there&rsquo;s a lot of people who stay infectious for like four. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a whole nother week that we&rsquo;re asking people to isolate. People would probably be much more likely</p>
<p>to comply if they only had to isolate as long as they wake up each morning and see two lines,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re actually seeing it for your own two eyes. You&rsquo;re being empowered to make your</p>
<p>own decision. You&rsquo;re not being told you need to isolate for 10 days and you&rsquo;re sitting there</p>
<p>thinking, oh, I feel fine. I don&rsquo;t know. There&rsquo;s a lot of asymptomatic spread. But if you see the</p>
<p>two lines every day, then you actually get to, you&rsquo;re doing a little experiment for yourself to</p>
<p>prove to yourself, today I&rsquo;m still infectious. Let&rsquo;s hope it&rsquo;s tomorrow. Come on immune system.</p>
<p>You can do this. And then you get to day four and boom, you start being negative.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a much more tolerable thing because you are being able to make that decision based on</p>
<p>true data that is empowering you. And it really does change, changes everything,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all fear and empowerment and these are empowering devices.</p>
<p>Well, I wanted to have this conversation with you because obviously it&rsquo;s a great solution.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s keep talking about it. People who will listen to this should,</p>
<p>I guess, pressure local politicians, federal, national politicians.</p>
<p>Write articles with the title like, Dear POTUS, please designate these as public health tools.</p>
<p>Or just start talking about it in the media. Talk about it on social media, anywhere.</p>
<p>Testing is a public health good. Testing is a public health good. It should not be considered</p>
<p>a medical device. I shouldn&rsquo;t have to pay to keep you safe. Testing should generally be free</p>
<p>for that matter, subsidized by the government. These tools exist. We should all&hellip; And I think</p>
<p>the more people that generate noise to just say, a public health test is a public health tool.</p>
<p>Period. You can&rsquo;t even argue with it. That&rsquo;s just true.</p>
<p>Yeah. I think if you talk about it enough, then certain people that have even a bigger platform,</p>
<p>like Elon Musk, Sunder Prachai, those folks that have power to really do large scale manufacturing,</p>
<p>also influence governments, will pay attention. And that&rsquo;s the hope. Enough people talk about it.</p>
<p>I think business leaders, like business leaders, obviously have so much power here.</p>
<p>Yeah. They pay the lobbyists who make things</p>
<p>happen. Let&rsquo;s be honest. There&rsquo;s people who pull levers that are not the politicians themselves.</p>
<p>And I do think business leaders have so much to gain from these tools to keep their businesses</p>
<p>safe, to not have to quarantine and lockdown. And I hope that all of them hear this message to say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s ask the president or the people around the president to designate these as public</p>
<p>health tools. Change the system. And if you can&rsquo;t change every aspect of the system,</p>
<p>then figure out how to change the system enough so that you&rsquo;re doing everything</p>
<p>in a safe way that is not endangering anyone, but it is only protective.</p>
<p>Yeah. You mentioned last time that you spent time as a Buddhist monk.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t spend much time talking about it. I just would love to talk to you about it a</p>
<p>little bit more. Maybe by way of advice, how do you recommend people can integrate</p>
<p>meditation into their lives? Or how does one meditate?</p>
<p>I think for me, meditation was really an active effort, which sounds weird because most people</p>
<p>think of meditation as the absence of activity. But just like anything, meditation requires</p>
<p>exercise. In this case, it requires exercise and quieting your mind. And the whole&hellip; Well,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of different reasons people meditate. Most people watching this podcast or this show,</p>
<p>what is this called? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Is this an interview? I&rsquo;m not even recording. This is</p>
<p>just you and I talking. It is. Most people are meditating to bring</p>
<p>some balance and bring some sanity to their life and just be able to control their feelings and</p>
<p>emotions a little bit more. And for that purpose, I think the best way to&hellip; What meditation is,</p>
<p>if you can call it what you will, it&rsquo;s just getting some alone time, some time to think</p>
<p>or not think. Whatever looks different for each person. For me, it was a very active effort to</p>
<p>try to quiet my mind with the explicit intent to detach from things, from lots of things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually&hellip; It sounds weird in our culture here to talk about detachment as a goal.</p>
<p>Detachment from loved ones, detachment from objects is easy to reconcile. People understand</p>
<p>that, yeah, I don&rsquo;t want to be too attached to my car or whatever. But detachment from</p>
<p>a loved one is a very hard thing because we want to do the opposite usually. We want to love a loved</p>
<p>one. But in a lot of Buddhist thought, it is those attachments that keep people in this cycle of</p>
<p>rebirth. Now, I don&rsquo;t personally believe in rebirth in a Buddhist sense in that you actually get</p>
<p>born multiple times. I think my personal feeling is we die and we&rsquo;re vanished. That&rsquo;s just me.</p>
<p>But I still really found meditation to be extraordinarily powerful to feel control over</p>
<p>a whole different part of my body that I never thought that it could be controlled, your mind.</p>
<p>You close your eyes and most of us immediately start seeing blotches and we start thinking about</p>
<p>things. And it&rsquo;s an amazing feeling to start getting to the point where you can actually</p>
<p>quiet your mind and close your mind down so that you can just have peace, silence of your mind</p>
<p>for a long period of time. And I loved it. But it&rsquo;s kind of a dangerous slope because you can</p>
<p>kind of get caught up in it and really start going from, okay, I&rsquo;m trying to quiet my mind</p>
<p>to almost being addicted to quieting your mind. And it was a very active exercise every day,</p>
<p>15 hours a day to just practice quieting my mind. And eventually I could. And in Buddhism,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole lot of stages that you go through too. Once you hit that point where you can quiet</p>
<p>your mind, then there&rsquo;s other psychological things that happen. And eventually the end goal for a</p>
<p>Buddhist monk who&rsquo;s spending their life meditating in the forest is to achieve nirvana, is to have</p>
<p>an absence of any attachment to the point where you&rsquo;re not even attached to your own foot or your</p>
<p>own leg. You can cut it off. So you don&rsquo;t even have an attachment to self, to ego? Do you feel</p>
<p>like a conscious being or no? Well, I never attained it, but I didn&rsquo;t really. So the goal</p>
<p>is you have to first look at it through the eyes of samsara, which is the cycle of rebirth,</p>
<p>which is suffering. It&rsquo;s a cycle of suffering is how it&rsquo;s viewed. And the idea is like,</p>
<p>if I really love this hat and then the hat gets lost, I&rsquo;m sad. So that makes me suffer.</p>
<p>And if I hate this hat and I see it, then it makes me sad or mad. And that is an emotion.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;m completely ambivalent about that hat, I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s there,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if it gets lost, if it&rsquo;s shredded, then that invokes no emotional rise out of me,</p>
<p>good or bad. And so the idea is to find the balance there where you are so detached from</p>
<p>everything that you&rsquo;re not getting a rise, negative or positive. And this is really,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really such a distinct thing in a relative to our normal lives here in America where we live</p>
<p>for rises. You want happiness and joy. And then you also, nobody wants sadness, but when you come</p>
<p>out of sadness, you feel happy. Either way it averages out. And if it doesn&rsquo;t average out,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re in a bad spot. That would be things like major depressive disorder where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>truly not averaging out. But if you&rsquo;re living a pretty happy life, that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s no right</p>
<p>or wrong. You can go up and down and you average out or you can just go that straight line.</p>
<p>So this is not necessarily the Buddhist ideal is somehow obviously the ideal you should strive for,</p>
<p>but the actual exercise of meditation that the Buddhist monks use seems like a</p>
<p>great tool for becoming aware of your own mind. And that seems to be important for</p>
<p>appreciating life. There&rsquo;s some kind of experiencing life on a deeper level.</p>
<p>I think so. I mean, that&rsquo;s my personal opinion is yes. And that I think it,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t meditate anymore.</p>
<p>Back in the capitalist Western world where there&rsquo;s meetings.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. I mean, I stopped after I was a monk and then the tsunami hit</p>
<p>and I lived in a refugee camp and that was the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004. And it just really,</p>
<p>it was really interesting in Sri Lanka. They wanted me, I asked, well, what can I do to help?</p>
<p>It was a horrible, horrible hell on earth experience in many ways. But when I said,</p>
<p>what can I do to help? The answer was, well, you could meditate. That&rsquo;s how, keep doing what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing. That&rsquo;s how we can get good karma. And to me, coming from Western roots, I just couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>deal with that. I just said that it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me. Why would I just sit and meditate</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s so much devastation happening here? And so I kind of stopped meditating then and then</p>
<p>never really recovered from that time in the refugee camp. But I do feel like I understand</p>
<p>or like I am aware of a part of me that most people never get the privilege to be aware of.</p>
<p>And that is a pretty profound feeling, I think, or just awareness to say, if I ever need to go</p>
<p>back to that, I have the capacity to do that. And I do use it. I mean, I don&rsquo;t use it a lot,</p>
<p>but I use it when I really need to, to try to settle myself, to actually calm myself, whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pain, physical or emotional pain. It is possible to make those things go away, but just</p>
<p>like anything, it takes training. If you take yourself back to that place you were, Sam Harris</p>
<p>talks about that through his meditation practice, he&rsquo;s able to escape the sense of free will</p>
<p>and the sense of agency. You can get away from that. Do you ever think about consciousness and</p>
<p>free will when you were meditating? Like, did you get some deep insight about the nature</p>
<p>of consciousness that you were somehow able to escape it through meditation or no?</p>
<p>I looked at it in a much more utilitarian way, I think.</p>
<p>The sensation, like minimizing amount of thoughts in your mind and then beginning to really</p>
<p>appreciate the sensation. You weren&rsquo;t writing a book on free will.</p>
<p>Right. I mean, maybe if I kept at it, there&rsquo;s a good chance that if the tsunami didn&rsquo;t happen,</p>
<p>I might still be sitting there on the top of that mountain.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s tsunamis, you see pain, you see, especially if you see cruelty and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>supposed to meditate through that, there&rsquo;s something in the human spirit that pushes us</p>
<p>to want to help. If you see somebody who&rsquo;s suffering, to react to that seems like to help</p>
<p>them as opposed to care less through meditation. Don&rsquo;t become attached to the suffering of others.</p>
<p>Exactly. I mean, that&rsquo;s, I do think that that&rsquo;s, you know, and they&rsquo;re two totally valid ways to</p>
<p>live life. They are, generally, I think they&rsquo;re ingrained in us pretty early in society.</p>
<p>Right. And it&rsquo;s hard to escape.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What about just in general, becoming detached from possessions, like minimalism in not having</p>
<p>many things. So, the capitalist world kind of pushes you towards having possessions and</p>
<p>deriving joy from more and more and better possessions. Have you returned back to the</p>
<p>joys of that world or do you find yourself enjoying the minimalist life?</p>
<p>A little of both. I think I really don&rsquo;t like, I find things to be a burden, to be a massive</p>
<p>burden. And to me, when you have a burden like that, you know, even if it&rsquo;s just knowing that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like boxes in your basement of stuff, you know, whatever it might be, it makes it hard to</p>
<p>focus. And so, I personally like, I mean, my ideal, like if I had a, my house, for example,</p>
<p>would be to have like nothing on anything. And that to me is like peaceful. Some people find</p>
<p>that to be not peaceful. For me, it&rsquo;s like, I love to have the idea that if needed, I could like</p>
<p>pack up and move and not worry about anything. Do I actually have that in reality? No. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about to have a baby, you know, but it&rsquo;s like, I already see it, it&rsquo;s like stressful. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like boxes of stuff showing up at the house, like bottles and clothes and all these little</p>
<p>hats and whatnot. And I do have to like sometimes go into my meditation to just say like, this is</p>
<p>okay. You know, like it&rsquo;s okay to have all of this stuff. It&rsquo;s not permanent, you know. And, but I do</p>
<p>think that it&rsquo;s easy to get lost in it all. And it&rsquo;s important to remember given all that, like</p>
<p>people who buy houses, you know, buy a home and buy a house and make a home out of it. And you</p>
<p>start a family. It&rsquo;s easy to forget that even though you have all these responsibilities,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still free. And like freedom takes work and it takes remembering, it takes</p>
<p>meditation on it, but you&rsquo;re free. You&rsquo;re born free, you live free. I mean, depends of course</p>
<p>which country, but in the United States, even with all the possessions, even with all the burdens</p>
<p>of sort of credit and owing money and all those kinds of things, you can scale everything down</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re free. But ultimately the people you love, you love each other, it doesn&rsquo;t take much</p>
<p>money to be happy together. And for me, I personally value that freedom of having the freedom to</p>
<p>always pursue your happiness as opposed to being burdened by material possessions that, you know,</p>
<p>yeah, that basically limit your ability to be happy because you&rsquo;re always paying off stuff.</p>
<p>You always catch, you know, trying to match the neighbors that are always a little bit richer,</p>
<p>that kind of pursuit. I think that pursuit is wonderful for innovation and for building</p>
<p>cooler, better things. But on an individual level, I think you have to remember that,</p>
<p>first of all, life is finite. And second of all, like your goal is not to get a bigger house.</p>
<p>Your goal is to be just content and happy in the moment.</p>
<p>I completely, completely agree with that. So in looking at our failure at scale</p>
<p>to engineer, to manufacture, to deploy tests, how do you feel about our prospect as a human</p>
<p>civilization? Are you optimistic? So this pandemic, it is what it is. It hurt a lot of people,</p>
<p>both it took lives, but it also hurt a lot of businesses and a lot of people economically.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s very likely to be a much worse pandemic down the line. There might be other</p>
<p>threats to human civilization. Are you nevertheless optimistic?</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m optimistic about it at all, I think.</p>
<p>What are you most worried about?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those things, it&rsquo;s so existential that I don&rsquo;t worry about it. But I do think,</p>
<p>I mean, in the United States, for example, so you asked about the human civilization,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s talk about like American society for a moment. I do think that we&rsquo;re probably seeing</p>
<p>the end of a really interesting experiment, like the American experiment,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re seeing its limitations. We&rsquo;re probably going to become another blip,</p>
<p>like another power that&rsquo;s in the history books that like rose and collapsed.</p>
<p>Probably that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;ll go. In terms of civilization, I think we&rsquo;re demonstrating a</p>
<p>pretty significant inability to recognize the danger, whether that&rsquo;s the pandemic or whether</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s climate change. I think it&rsquo;s extraordinary that we are not taking these things seriously.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not acting with the urgency. And I mean, in some ways, climate change</p>
<p>truly makes like this pandemic look like child&rsquo;s play in terms of like the destruction it has the</p>
<p>potential to wreak. I tend to think if you just look at the progress of human history,</p>
<p>that the people who do good in the world outpower the people that do bad in the world.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something about our minds that likes to focus on the negative, like on the destructive,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re afraid of it. It&rsquo;s also, for some reason, more fun to watch destruction.</p>
<p>But it seems like the people who build, who create solutions, who innovate, and who just put</p>
<p>like both on the emotional level, so love out there and like on the actual engineering level,</p>
<p>tools that make for higher quality of life. I think those win out if you look at human history.</p>
<p>But the question is whether the negative stuff can sometimes peak to the level where everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just destroyed. But as long as that doesn&rsquo;t happen, I tend to believe that there&rsquo;ll be like</p>
<p>a gradual, with some noise, a gradual improvement of quality of life in human civilization.</p>
<p>I do think so, to a certain extent. But it&rsquo;s that what you said, like unless there&rsquo;s like some</p>
<p>significant peak of bad, you know, the problem with bad is that it can happen like that, you know,</p>
<p>good. You can&rsquo;t build a society overnight, but you sure can kill one. Like I just think about</p>
<p>food crises and instability and just, I don&rsquo;t know. But I do hope that, I mean, I completely agree. I</p>
<p>think we can engineer our way to a healthier, better world. Like I truly do. My concern is that</p>
<p>the people who are doing that until very recently don&rsquo;t generally rule the world. Now, of course,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing non elected leaders and, you know, people who run massive corporations essentially</p>
<p>having as much or really more power than elected leaders, or than kings and queens and such. So how</p>
<p>they choose to wield that power, you know, is an interesting choice. And I do hope that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right in that over time, fear will drive companies to produce a better product or whatever, you know,</p>
<p>something like over time, it&rsquo;s just like predator prey models. You get so bad or so everything like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so revved up that all of a sudden, something cracks and they say, okay, I do want an electric</p>
<p>car or whatever. And that takes some combination of innovation, letting people know that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>an innovation, letting people know that these electric cars exist. It&rsquo;s kind of rapid test too.</p>
<p>Like you get to finally feel it and see it, have an electric car. And then all of a sudden things</p>
<p>change and everyone says, oh, this is so bad. And actually I&rsquo;m doing good for the world, relatively</p>
<p>speaking. And, you know, I guess the paradigm shift, it becomes a, for lack of a better word,</p>
<p>viral positivity does. And I mean, I believe that ultimately that wins out</p>
<p>out because I think there&rsquo;s much more power to be gained. So I think most people want to do good.</p>
<p>And if you want to wield power, you want to channel people&rsquo;s desire to do good.</p>
<p>And I think over time that&rsquo;s exactly what people will do. But yeah, this, I mean, both on the</p>
<p>natural side, the pandemic, you know, there&rsquo;s still biology at play. There&rsquo;s still viruses</p>
<p>out there trying to kill us. There&rsquo;s accidents. There&rsquo;s nuclear weapons. There&rsquo;s unintended</p>
<p>consequences of tools, whether it&rsquo;s on the nanotechnology side or the artificial intelligence</p>
<p>side. Then there&rsquo;s the natural things like meteors and all that kind of stuff and the climate change,</p>
<p>all of that. But I tend to think we humans are a clever bunch. And when there&rsquo;s a deadline,</p>
<p>a real deadline or a real threat before us, we kind of step up. I don&rsquo;t know, but maybe you have</p>
<p>to believe that until the very end. Otherwise life&rsquo;s not as fun.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. I mean, we&rsquo;ll have to see, I guess. Well, ideally we won&rsquo;t be alive to see that.</p>
<p>Well, no, Michael, I&rsquo;m glad we talk again because this has been such a difficult time</p>
<p>that feels like there&rsquo;s no solutions. And it&rsquo;s so refreshing to hear that there&rsquo;s a solution</p>
<p>to COVID. And there&rsquo;s an engineering solution on the individual level, something people can do.</p>
<p>On the government level, it&rsquo;s something people can do. On the global level, something people can do.</p>
<p>We should be doing rapid testing at scale. It&rsquo;s obvious. It&rsquo;s amazing that you still</p>
<p>are telling that story, pushing that message bravely, boldly. I really,</p>
<p>really appreciate the work you&rsquo;re doing. And I will do in my small way the same to try to help out</p>
<p>and everybody else should too until we get hundreds of millions of tests in people&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an obvious solution. We should have had it a long time ago. And I like solutions, not problems.</p>
<p>And this is obviously a solution. So thank you for presenting it to the world and thank you for</p>
<p>talking about it. It&rsquo;s something that I can&rsquo;t not do. If it saves one person&rsquo;s life, then it was</p>
<p>worth the two years of lobbying for this. And so let&rsquo;s hope we see a change. Thanks for talking today.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Michael Mina. To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from</p>
<p>Lord Byron. Always laugh when you can. It is cheap medicine. Thank you for listening and hope to see</p>
<p>you next time.</p>
