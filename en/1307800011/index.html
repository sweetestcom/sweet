    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language. In this episode, we&rsquo;re going to look at the emergence of the Germanic tribes,</p>
<p>the early Greek speakers, the first Latin-speaking tribes in Italy, and the Celtic tribes in</p>
<p>Central and Western Europe. So we&rsquo;re going to begin a shift from the original Indo-Europeans</p>
<p>to the various daughter languages, which directly influenced the development of English.</p>
<p>But before I begin this episode, let me address a couple of housekeeping matters. First, I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>not mentioned the website or the email address for the podcast lately, so let me do that.</p>
<p>The website address is historyofenglishpodcast.com, and my email address is kevin at historyofenglishpodcast.com.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve also started a Twitter account for the podcast, and that&rsquo;s English Hist Pod.</p>
<p>So with all of that out of the way, let&rsquo;s turn to this episode. Last time, I looked</p>
<p>at the factors which led to the emergence of the first Indo-Europeans in Eurasia and</p>
<p>the early expansion of some of those people into modern-day Turkey and Western China.</p>
<p>I now want to focus on the early linguistic ancestors of the Germanic languages, and also</p>
<p>the ancestors of early Greek and Latin and the Celtic languages. As you may recall from</p>
<p>earlier episodes, I&rsquo;ve discussed the distinction that many linguists make between the so-called</p>
<p>Kentum and Satum languages within the larger family of Indo-European languages. This distinction</p>
<p>actually has very little relevance today, other than identifying an early division within</p>
<p>the original Indo-European tribes. But if you will recall, the Kentum languages are</p>
<p>generally spoken in the West, and they include the Germanic languages, Greek, Latin, and</p>
<p>the Celtic languages. And as I&rsquo;ve mentioned previously, these are the languages which</p>
<p>have directly impacted the history of English. So in many respects, the history of pre-English,</p>
<p>the period before the Anglo-Saxons arrived in Britain, is really the history of the Kentum</p>
<p>languages. You may also recall that there were two Kentum languages which were not spoken in</p>
<p>Central and Western Europe, but instead were spoken far to the east in modern-day Turkey and</p>
<p>China. Those are the Anatolian languages, including Hittite, and the Ticarian language of Western</p>
<p>China. But those languages represent a very early split within the Indo-European tribes. So let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>do a quick recap from the last episode. Last time I discussed the emergence of the Indo-European</p>
<p>tribes in the Eurasian Steppe region, north of the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. And I noted</p>
<p>that these people were nomads and herders who mastered horse domestication and horse riding</p>
<p>very early on. Perhaps they were the first humans to accomplish those feats. And I noted that to the</p>
<p>west of the Black Sea in the Balkans were some of the first agricultural settlements in Europe.</p>
<p>And whereas the Indo-Europeans in the steppes were herders and nomads, these Balkan settlements were</p>
<p>based around farming and cereal cultivation. But around 4000 BC, Indo-European herders swept</p>
<p>southwestward from the Steppe region into the Balkan region, and apparently they overran these</p>
<p>Balkan settlements. And these were likely the ancestors of the Hittites, who eventually found</p>
<p>their way to central Anatolia, south of the Black Sea. It appears that all of the Indo-European</p>
<p>tribes at this point spoke the so-called Kentum dialects, with the K sound as the initial consonant</p>
<p>in words like hundred. So Hittite is classified as a Kentum language. And a short time later,</p>
<p>maybe around 3600 BC, give or take a few centuries, some linguists believe the ancestors of the</p>
<p>Ticarian speakers separated in the Steppe region and moved eastward across the steppes,</p>
<p>eventually passing east of the Caspian Sea and into the region where the Ticarian languages</p>
<p>were discovered in the early 1900s in northwestern China. Again, the Ticarian language is a Kentum</p>
<p>language, and this fact seems to confirm the early split of the Ticarian branch from the main group.</p>
<p>Around this same time, a new culture began to emerge in the northwestern corner of the Black</p>
<p>Sea, in the region between the Indo-European homeland, north of the Black Sea, and the area</p>
<p>of those Balkan settlements, which I mentioned earlier, west of the Black Sea. Remember that</p>
<p>those Balkan settlements had been abandoned and overrun about 4000 BC by the early Indo-European</p>
<p>herders. Well now, around five centuries later, a new culture had started to emerge in that region.</p>
<p>This culture is known as the Ussutovo culture, and many modern linguists and historians believe</p>
<p>that the Indo-European dialect which they spoke is the direct ancestor of the original Germanic</p>
<p>language, which eventually emerged in northern Europe. So that makes this Ussutovo dialect the</p>
<p>ultimate ancestor of English as well. So let&rsquo;s take a look at what we know about these people.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s get a handle on the specific area I&rsquo;m talking about. If you think of the Black Sea as a</p>
<p>clock, these people lived at around 10 or 11 o&rsquo;clock near the mouth of the Dniester River in</p>
<p>and around modern-day Odessa. This puts them near the southernmost portion of modern-day Ukraine and</p>
<p>in and around modern-day Moldavia and eastern Romania. Now as you move westward from the Black</p>
<p>Sea, the elevation rises as you move toward the Carpathian Mountains, and this Ussutovo culture</p>
<p>extended from the low-lying steppe region near the Black Sea westward into some of these higher</p>
<p>elevations of the eastern Carpathian Mountains. As I said, this culture began to emerge around 3500</p>
<p>BC, a few centuries after the first group of Indo-Europeans, believed to be the ancestors of the</p>
<p>Hittites, swept through the area on their way to modern-day Turkey. And not surprisingly, given the</p>
<p>location of this region, this new culture appears to have been a bit of a hybrid culture, a kind of</p>
<p>mixture between the Balkan farmers to the south and the Indo-European herders to the north. Based</p>
<p>upon archaeological research, the people who lived closer to the Black Sea in the lowland steppe</p>
<p>region were herders, much like the older Indo-Europeans to the north. But inland, in the upland</p>
<p>regions of the Balkans, it appears that those people practiced grain farming. There are about</p>
<p>50 known Ussutovo sites which have been excavated in that region. Based upon artifacts found in</p>
<p>graves, archaeologists have confirmed that these people used bronze daggers and axes, so this was</p>
<p>a bronze age society. And based upon bone evidence, it appears that their economy depended on sheep</p>
<p>and goats, but especially sheep. And this suggests that they were raising sheep for wool. Evidence of</p>
<p>looms appears more predominantly in the upland areas, suggesting that the steppe farmers closer</p>
<p>to the sea were raising the sheep and the upland people converted it to textiles. And pottery</p>
<p>impressions also indicate the presence of wheat, barley, millet, oats, and peas. Archaeologists have</p>
<p>also unearthed tools used in harvesting cereals, so this is the first evidence of cereal cultivation</p>
<p>this far north in this region of the steppes. So, as I said, we do have some basic agriculture in</p>
<p>place here, and this was likely an extension of the Balkan farming settlements to the south.</p>
<p>The pottery made by the Ussutovo culture has the shape of the upland region, but it was often</p>
<p>decorated like the steppe pottery. And a white glass bead found at a Ussutovo site is the oldest</p>
<p>known glass object in the Black Sea region, and perhaps in the entire ancient world. But it was</p>
<p>almost certainly imported. In fact, some of the pottery and other objects that have been unearthed</p>
<p>in this area have been identified as being from the Aegean region and Anatolia, including perhaps</p>
<p>the oldest site of the ancient city of Troy. And that suggests that trade was also very important</p>
<p>for these people. Now, I mentioned earlier that as you move westward from the Black Sea, you</p>
<p>encounter the Carpathian Mountains. But I should mention one other thing about that particular</p>
<p>mountain range. Notably, the way that mountain range is shaped. Again, this is one of those points</p>
<p>when reference to a map would probably help, and you can find one at historyofenglishpodcast.com.</p>
<p>Just click episode 11. But if you look at a map of the Carpathian Mountains in relation to the</p>
<p>Black Sea, something very obvious will appear. The mountain range basically forms a wedge shape just</p>
<p>to the west of the Black Sea. It basically means that any westward moving tribe has to either move</p>
<p>northwestward around the north side of the mountain range, or has to move southward underneath the</p>
<p>south side of the mountain range through the Balkans and into the Aegean region. And this</p>
<p>basic fact of geography probably accounts for the ultimate split of the various Indo-European tribes</p>
<p>as they moved westward. So, as we look at the Usotovo culture, I mentioned that the culture</p>
<p>existed near the mouth of the Dniester River. And the Dniester River extends northwestward along the</p>
<p>northern side of the Carpathian Mountains. And this appears to be the avenue for the spread of</p>
<p>the Usotovo dialect into Central Europe. Over time, the Usotovo dialect spread up the Dniester River</p>
<p>along the northern side of the Carpathian Mountains. It eventually spread into the region</p>
<p>where modern-day eastern Poland and western Ukraine meet, basically the middle of eastern</p>
<p>Europe. But the exact manner in which this happened is not known for certain. Trade was</p>
<p>probably a factor, because rivers were the ancient highways for trade. And that&rsquo;s true even to a</p>
<p>certain extent today. And, of course, trade routes also often become migration routes. So, the Dniester</p>
<p>River helped to export these people and their dialects northwestward into northern Europe.</p>
<p>So, as we turn our attention westward into the heart of Central and Western Europe,</p>
<p>we should consider what was happening there around this same time period around 3500 BC.</p>
<p>And the answer, unfortunately, is that there doesn&rsquo;t appear to be very much going on at all,</p>
<p>at least as it relates to towns or civilization. Keep in mind that, compared to the Middle East</p>
<p>and Egypt, most of Central and Western Europe was always a little late to the party when it came to</p>
<p>things like agriculture, the Bronze Age, the Iron Age, cities, and so forth. So, at this very early</p>
<p>point, what little is known about most of Central and Western Europe comes from archaeological</p>
<p>research. Now, archaeologists who have studied the earliest European cultures tend to divide Europe</p>
<p>into two general groups during this period. In the far western parts of Europe, including modern</p>
<p>France and Britain, they have identified a type of pottery shaped like beakers. And the people who</p>
<p>made that pottery are often called the beaker people or the bell beaker people. And these people</p>
<p>likely included people who constructed Stonehenge in Britain, as well as many similar hinges and</p>
<p>monuments throughout the region. And that&rsquo;s actually an important point because I think</p>
<p>we often associate Stonehenge with Celtic people, including the Druids who were part of the Celtic</p>
<p>culture. But remember that Stonehenge was built long before the Celtic people arrived. We&rsquo;ve not</p>
<p>even gotten to the Celtic speakers yet. So, when the Celtic people eventually arrived in Britain</p>
<p>many, many centuries later, they sort of adopted Stonehenge for religious and other ritual purposes.</p>
<p>So, the original construction of that monument dates all the way back to this original period</p>
<p>of the bell beaker people. Now, in Central, Eastern, and Northern Europe, archaeologists</p>
<p>have identified a completely different type of pottery which has a cord-like design wrapped</p>
<p>around the outside. And the cultures who made this type of pottery are called the Corded Ware</p>
<p>cultures. Now, the significance of these general groupings of pottery into separate cultures,</p>
<p>the bell beaker people and the Corded Ware people, is that these particular types of pottery were</p>
<p>spread over such a large region. And that suggests that there was some type of general trade and</p>
<p>communication amongst people over vast areas of Europe very early on. And that&rsquo;s why the</p>
<p>same type of pottery exists over such a large area. And as I said, the cultures of Central and</p>
<p>Eastern Europe are called Corded Ware cultures. And it appears that the westward-moving Indo-Europeans</p>
<p>of the Usotovo culture, which I mentioned earlier, encountered the people of these early Corded Ware</p>
<p>cultures in Central and Eastern Europe. And historians believe that the trade and migration</p>
<p>routes which linked these Corded Ware communities also enabled the spread of these Usotovo people</p>
<p>as they entered into and spread throughout the same region. Now, the exact nature of these links</p>
<p>and the precise manner in which these pre-Germanic dialects spread throughout the region are not known</p>
<p>for certain. As is generally the case with the early Indo-European migrations, it&rsquo;s difficult to</p>
<p>say how much of this represents a spread of language and how much involved the actual migration</p>
<p>or spread of people. As we know, or should know by now, language can expand by virtue of people</p>
<p>learning the language. And economic power or trading power can be a factor in that spread.</p>
<p>We see it in modern English today. So did these early Eastern European people learn this Usotovo</p>
<p>dialect? Or did people from this Usotovo region migrate westward into this territory? The answer</p>
<p>is probably some combination of both. Trade was probably a major factor at work here. As these</p>
<p>people migrated and traded up the Dniester River, they probably established settlements along the</p>
<p>way. And the language spread throughout this region as these people spread. So while we have</p>
<p>the Usotovo dialect spreading northwestward into northern Europe, we need to turn our attention</p>
<p>back to the Black Sea for a moment. Because around this same time period, we may be able to trace the</p>
<p>emergence of the first Indo-European tribes which eventually produced the Latin and Celtic languages.</p>
<p>Some linguists and archaeologists believe that a group of Indo-European speaking herders began to</p>
<p>move from the steppe region north of the Black Sea down through the Usotovo territory we just</p>
<p>talked about during its earliest phases of existence. And these herders continued this</p>
<p>trek southwestward around the Black Sea, eventually settling around the Danube on the western Black Sea.</p>
<p>This migration stream then continued up the Danube Valley into the Carpathian Basin.</p>
<p>Remember that the Carpathian Mountains created this wedge shape which I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>And that tended to force migrating tribes either northwestward or southward from the Black Sea</p>
<p>region. And whereas the Usotovo dialects took the northern trek into northern Europe, these other</p>
<p>migrating tribes apparently took the southern route around the southern side of the Carpathian</p>
<p>Mountains and then westward along the Danube. The general time frame here is around 3100 BC</p>
<p>to 2800 BC. As I said, some linguists and historians believe that these tribes may have</p>
<p>been the ancestors of the Italic speakers of Italy, including Latin, and the later Celtic</p>
<p>branches of the Indo-European family tree. Again, there&rsquo;s no consensus here. Other experts believe</p>
<p>the early Italic and early Celtic branches separated much later, perhaps as an offshoot</p>
<p>of the early Greek tribes who eventually settled into Greece. But regardless, it does appear that</p>
<p>these three groups, the early Greeks, the early Latin speakers, and the early Celts, they all took</p>
<p>a southward track along the Danube in contrast to the pre-Germanic Usotovo people who took the</p>
<p>northwestward track along the Dniester River. And this may help to explain why the early sound</p>
<p>shifts that we know as Grimslaw, which I discussed in an earlier episode, are found in and throughout</p>
<p>the Germanic languages, but they are not present in Latin, Greek, or the Celtic languages. So again,</p>
<p>this early split and division may account for some of that. Now this is a good time for a quick look</p>
<p>around to see what else was going on. And around this same time frame, say around 3100 BC, we start</p>
<p>to see the earliest Egyptian civilization starting to emerge from farming settlements along the Nile.</p>
<p>So again, we&rsquo;re at the cusp of civilization here. Now you may have also noticed that all of the</p>
<p>various Indo-European groups that I&rsquo;ve mentioned up to this point are kentum speaking groups. The</p>
<p>Hittites in Turkey, the Tukarians in Western China, the early Germanic dialects spreading</p>
<p>into Northern Europe, the ancestors of the Latin, Greek, and Celtic dialects which were moving into</p>
<p>the Danube Valley region south of the Carpathian Mountains. All of those are kentum languages.</p>
<p>Within a couple of centuries, say around 2800 BC, linguists think we finally get the split between</p>
<p>the kentum and satum language groups. And it probably happened when a division occurred within</p>
<p>this same western steppe region near or around where the Ussutovo culture was located. It appears</p>
<p>that one group began a migration northward and eastward. This was the satum branch, and the</p>
<p>speakers of this branch soon developed a sound shift from the K sound to the S sound, which marks</p>
<p>the distinction between those two general groups. And the tribes within this satum speaking group</p>
<p>soon divided again with some of the Indo-Europeans remaining in Northern Europe as the ancestors of</p>
<p>the Baltic and Slavic languages. Meanwhile, some of the tribes within this group migrated eastward</p>
<p>along the steppes and eventually migrated around the Caspian Sea and settled into modern Iran and</p>
<p>northern India. These were the ancestors of the tribes who brought the Indo-Iranian languages to</p>
<p>Central Asia, all of which are satum languages, as you will recall. So we now have accounted for all</p>
<p>of the major pieces of the puzzle. And let me reiterate, this is just one view of those events.</p>
<p>Once again, I&rsquo;m relying in part on David Anthony&rsquo;s book, The Horse, The Wheel, and Language for part</p>
<p>of the sequence and time frame that I&rsquo;m discussing here. But there really is no consensus of opinion</p>
<p>as to the exact timing and order of these events. Now, as we look at Northern Europe, remember we</p>
<p>have the so-called Corded Ware people who made a particular type of pottery with cord-like designs.</p>
<p>And these Corded Ware cultures existed throughout Northern Europe in the region north of the</p>
<p>Carpathian Mountains. But from the east, we&rsquo;re getting migrations of Indo-Europeans, and this</p>
<p>includes the pre-Germanic people from the Ussutova region. And now it also includes the ancestors of</p>
<p>the Baltic and Slavic speakers, which are part of that original satum group. All of these northward</p>
<p>and westward moving Indo-European people met and traded with the Corded Ware people in the</p>
<p>Carpathian foothills, and that facilitated the spread of those Indo-European dialects throughout</p>
<p>this region. And eventually, these dialects coalesced into the Slavic and Baltic languages</p>
<p>in the east, and the original Germanic language in and around Scandinavia. Archaeologists have noted</p>
<p>that during this period, many of these Corded Ware people began to adopt many of the cultural and</p>
<p>economic features of the Indo-Europeans. For example, they adopted a pastoral herding economy</p>
<p>like the Indo-Europeans, and they began to adopt certain funeral rituals associated with the</p>
<p>Indo-Europeans. So what we&rsquo;re seeing here is likely a blending of cultures and peoples.</p>
<p>But the language and dialects of the Indo-Europeans would emerge as the dominant languages, and other</p>
<p>native languages tended to disappear. We may never know exactly why that happened, but I alluded to</p>
<p>some of the possible factors in the last episode. Indo-European speech might have been emulated</p>
<p>because the chiefs who spoke it had larger herds of cattle and sheep, and they had more horses than</p>
<p>the peoples of northern Europe. The Indo-Europeans also had growing populations due to more efficient</p>
<p>herding and the invention of dairy farming. Remember that most of Europe was very sparsely</p>
<p>populated at this time, so even modest population advantages could overwhelm many of the native</p>
<p>cultures in Europe. But beyond the economic and population advantages, there was a definite</p>
<p>military advantage as well. The culture of the Indo-Europeans allowed and embraced territorial</p>
<p>expansion. When it came to raiding and warfare, the Indo-Europeans had major advantages because</p>
<p>they had domesticated and could ride horses, and they appeared to have blended their mastery of</p>
<p>horses and wheeled wagons into the creation of chariots for use in warfare and raiding.</p>
<p>In fact, chariot technology is generally considered to be another innovation of these</p>
<p>Indo-European herders around this same time period. If they didn&rsquo;t actually invent the chariot,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some dispute about that, they certainly perfected it. At around 2500 BC, horses were still</p>
<p>rarely found in much of central Europe, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent. So the</p>
<p>Indo-European tribes who were migrating into new areas had massive advantages due to their ability</p>
<p>to ride horses and especially their ability to engage other tribes with horse-drawn chariots.</p>
<p>This technology made the Indo-European tribes a formidable force. Horse-drawn chariots could</p>
<p>literally run circles around their opponents with one person driving the chariot and another</p>
<p>launching arrows. Of course, the chariot technology was quickly adopted throughout</p>
<p>the Western world, but initially it gave the Indo-Europeans a major military advantage.</p>
<p>Again, the exact details of the spread of the Indo-Europeans are not entirely known</p>
<p>and may never be completely known, but we can say with some certainty that the dialects of</p>
<p>these people were spreading throughout Europe and Central Asia during this time period.</p>
<p>So to the north, we have the early ancestors of the Germanic-speaking tribes taking position</p>
<p>in Northern Europe around Scandinavia, and the early ancestral Baltic and Slavic languages</p>
<p>are settling in and taking over most of Eastern Europe, and the eastern branch of those Satem-speaking</p>
<p>tribes continue to migrate eastward into Central Asia. The ancestors of the Indo-Iranians brought</p>
<p>their horse-drawn chariots with them, and that was definitely part of the reason why they spread so</p>
<p>far and so fast over that region, and they eventually established the Persian Empire</p>
<p>and the early Indus civilization in India. So that leaves us with those tribes, which I</p>
<p>mentioned earlier, who traveled southwest around the Black Sea to the region south of the Carpathian</p>
<p>Mountains in the Danube Valley. They had made that trek a few centuries before, and it appears</p>
<p>that they had settled in that region for a while, and these appeared to be the ancestors of the</p>
<p>Celtic-speaking tribes and the Italic-speaking tribes, which eventually produced Latin. There</p>
<p>are some strong linguistic similarities between Latin and Celtic, and as a result, many linguists</p>
<p>have always believed that the early ancestors of those language families were either part of the</p>
<p>same group or they lived in close proximity to each other, and it was around this time, around</p>
<p>2800 BC, that some of the tribes within this group in the Danube Valley began to spread northward</p>
<p>from modern Hungary into modern Austria and Bavaria, and these were the ancestors of the Celtic</p>
<p>speakers, and their linguistic descendants would eventually come to dominate much of Central and</p>
<p>Western Europe. Meanwhile, some of those Indo-European-speaking tribes remained in Hungary,</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t make the trek into Austria and Bavaria. These tribes eventually migrated westward</p>
<p>and then southward down into Italy, and these Italic tribes were the ancestors of the Italic</p>
<p>branch, and they were thus the ancestors of the Latin-speaking tribes, which eventually emerged</p>
<p>in Italy. And also around this same time, say around 2500 BC, the ancestors of the Greeks</p>
<p>separated from the main group of Indo-Europeans and began to migrate southward toward modern Greece.</p>
<p>So by this point, all of the actors have either taken the stage or they&rsquo;re on their way to the</p>
<p>theater. The next step here is the actual emergence of the various dialects in the areas where they</p>
<p>would eventually become known to the modern world. By 2000 BC, the Hittites had penetrated</p>
<p>into Anatolia, where they soon established the Hittite Empire, and within a century or so,</p>
<p>the early Hittite language and other Anatolian languages were being spoken in Anatolia,</p>
<p>modern-day Turkey. Around the same time, the first ancestors of the Greeks began arriving in Greece,</p>
<p>where they encountered an existing non-Indo-European civilization on the island of Crete,</p>
<p>which was the Minoan civilization. But within a couple of more centuries, the earliest Greek</p>
<p>dialect, the Mycenaean Greek dialect, was being spoken throughout mainland Greece and the small</p>
<p>islands surrounding it. But the Minoan civilization was still in place in Crete.</p>
<p>Eventually, those Mycenaean Greeks settled in and overtook the Minoan civilization in Crete,</p>
<p>at which point we have the early Indo-European Greek language spread throughout the entire</p>
<p>territory of Greece. A century or so later, say around 1500 BC, Sanskrit writing had appeared</p>
<p>in northern India, and the Balto-Slavic languages were being spoken in eastern Europe.</p>
<p>By about 1200 BC, the early Iranian languages were being spoken east of the Caspian Sea,</p>
<p>and over in Italy, the earliest Italic languages were being spoken,</p>
<p>including the early versions of Latin. But it&rsquo;s not until around 500 BC, several centuries later,</p>
<p>that we can finally confirm that the earliest Germanic dialects were being spoken in and</p>
<p>around Scandinavia in northern Europe. So now all of the players are in place,</p>
<p>and interestingly, those early Germanic dialects are some of the last attested Indo-European</p>
<p>languages, certainly in Europe. Like I said, the date at which we can actually confirm that</p>
<p>Germanic dialects were on the ground and being spoken in Scandinavia is around 500 BC. But the</p>
<p>Germanic dialects didn&rsquo;t just pop up around that date. There was a continuous evolution of the</p>
<p>original Indo-European language into that Ussutovu dialect, then mixing with the languages</p>
<p>of the Kordid-Wehr people, and eventually emerging as the Germanic dialects in northern Europe.</p>
<p>But beyond those general statements, there&rsquo;s just not enough evidence to give any specific time</p>
<p>frame or exact sequence of events to describe how we got there. Like much of the story of the</p>
<p>Indo-European migrations, historians think they know where it all began, and they know where the</p>
<p>languages ended up. They just have to fill in the middle part as best they can. So we&rsquo;ll just have</p>
<p>to leave it at that for now. So with all of the pieces in place, we can now start to focus in on</p>
<p>each of the language families which directly influenced English. In the next episode, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to start with the Hittites and the Greeks. Now the Hittite language didn&rsquo;t really have any</p>
<p>direct impact on English, but Greek certainly did. And the early history of these two people</p>
<p>are intertwined. So next time, we&rsquo;re going to focus on the Eastern Mediterranean, and we will</p>
<p>see how the early Greeks emerged to establish a culture and a language which heavily influenced</p>
<p>the entire Western world. And they also did something very important to all language historians.</p>
<p>They reduced their language to writing and wrote extensively in an alphabet, which we still use</p>
<p>today, albeit in a modified form. So next time, we&rsquo;ll look at the Greek influence on English,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll jump back into the language itself and see how Greek is still reflected in modern English.</p>
<p>So until next time, thanks for listening to the History of English podcast.</p>
