    <p>The following is a conversation with Grant Sanderson, his second time on the podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s known to millions of people as the mind behind 3Blue1Brown, a YouTube channel where</p>
<p>he educates and inspires the world with the beauty and power of mathematics.</p>
<p>Quick summary of the sponsors, Dollar Shave Club, DoorDash, and CashApp.</p>
<p>Click the sponsor links in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast,</p>
<p>especially for the two new sponsors, Dollar Shave Club and DoorDash.</p>
<p>Let me say, as a side note, I think that this pandemic challenged millions of educators</p>
<p>to rethink how they teach, to rethink the nature of education.</p>
<p>As people know, Grant is a master elucidator of mathematical concepts that may otherwise</p>
<p>seem difficult or out of reach for students and curious minds, but he&rsquo;s also an inspiration</p>
<p>to teachers, researchers, and people who just enjoy sharing knowledge.</p>
<p>Like me, for what it&rsquo;s worth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to give a semester&rsquo;s worth of multi hour lectures, it&rsquo;s another to extract</p>
<p>from those lectures the most important, interesting, beautiful, and difficult concepts and present</p>
<p>them in a way that makes everything fall into place.</p>
<p>That is the challenge that is worth taking on.</p>
<p>My dream is to see more and more of my colleagues at MIT and world experts across the world</p>
<p>summon their inner 3Blue1Brown and create the canonical explainer videos on a topic</p>
<p>that they know more than almost anyone else in the world.</p>
<p>Amidst the political division, the economic pain, the psychological and medical toll of</p>
<p>the virus, masterfully crafted educational content feels like one of the beacons of hope</p>
<p>that we can hold onto.</p>
<p>If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube, review it with 5 Stars and Apple Podcasts,</p>
<p>follow on Spotify, support on Patreon, or connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman.</p>
<p>Of course, after you go immediately, which you already probably have done a long time</p>
<p>ago, and subscribe to 3Blue1Brown&rsquo;s YouTube channel, you will not regret it.</p>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;ll do a few minutes of as now and no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make these interesting, but I give you timestamps so you can skip.</p>
<p>But still, please do check out the sponsors by clicking the links in the description.</p>
<p>Especially the two new ones, DoorDash and Dollar Shave Club, they&rsquo;re evaluating us,</p>
<p>looking at how many people go to their site and get their stuff in order to determine</p>
<p>if they want to support us for the long term, so you know what to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast, as always.</p>
<p>This show is sponsored by Dollar Shave Club.</p>
<p>Try them out with a one time offer for only $5 and free shipping at DollarShaveClub.com</p>
<p>slash Lex.</p>
<p>The starter kit comes with a six blade razor, refills, and all kinds of other stuff that</p>
<p>makes shaving feel great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a member of Dollar Shave Club for over five years now, and actually signed up</p>
<p>when I first heard about them on the Joe Rogan podcast, and now we have come full circle.</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;ve made it, now that I can do a read for them just like Joe did all those</p>
<p>years ago.</p>
<p>For the most part, I&rsquo;ve just used the razor and the refills, but they encouraged me to</p>
<p>try the shave butter, which I&rsquo;ve never used before, so I did, and I love it.</p>
<p>Not sure how the chemistry of it works out, but it&rsquo;s translucent somehow, which is a</p>
<p>cool new experience.</p>
<p>Again, try the Ultimate Shave Starter Set today for just $5 plus free shipping at DollarShaveClub.com</p>
<p>slash Lex.</p>
<p>This show is also sponsored by DoorDash.</p>
<p>Get $5 off and zero delivery fees on your first order of $15 or more when you download</p>
<p>the DoorDash app and enter code LEX.</p>
<p>I have so many memories of working late nights for a deadline with a team of engineers and</p>
<p>eventually taking a break to argue about which DoorDash restaurant to order from, and when</p>
<p>the food came, those moments of bonding, of exchanging ideas, of pausing to shift attention</p>
<p>from the programs to the humans were special.</p>
<p>These days, for a bit of time, I&rsquo;m on my own, sadly, so I miss that camaraderie.</p>
<p>But actually DoorDash is still there for me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a million options that fit into my keto diet ways.</p>
<p>Also it&rsquo;s a great way to support restaurants in these challenging times.</p>
<p>Once again, download the DoorDash app and enter code LEX to get $5 off and zero delivery</p>
<p>fees on your first order of $15 or more.</p>
<p>Finally, this show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>When you get it, use code LEX PODCAST.</p>
<p>Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with</p>
<p>as little as $1.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the best design interfaces of an app that I&rsquo;ve ever used.</p>
<p>To me, good design is when everything is easy and natural.</p>
<p>Bad design is when the app gets in the way either because it&rsquo;s buggy or because it tries</p>
<p>too hard to be helpful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at you, Clippy.</p>
<p>Anyway, there&rsquo;s a big part of my brain and heart that love to design things and also</p>
<p>to appreciate great design by others.</p>
<p>So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play and use code LEX PODCAST,</p>
<p>you get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, an organization that is helping</p>

<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Grant Sanderson.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve spoken about Richard Feynman as someone you admire.</p>
<p>I think last time we spoke, we ran out of time.</p>
<p>So I wanted to talk to you about him.</p>
<p>Who is Richard Feynman to you in your eyes?</p>
<p>What impact did he have on you?</p>
<p>I mean, I think a ton of people like Feynman.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit cliche to say that you like Feynman, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s almost like when you don&rsquo;t know what to say about sports and you just point to</p>
<p>the Super Bowl or something or something you enjoy watching.</p>
<p>But I do actually think there&rsquo;s a layer to Feynman that sits behind the iconography.</p>
<p>One thing that just really struck me was this letter that he wrote to his wife two years</p>
<p>after she died.</p>
<p>So during the Manhattan Project, she had polio.</p>
<p>Tragically she died.</p>
<p>They were just young, madly in love.</p>
<p>And the icon of Feynman is almost this mildly sexist, womanizing philanderer, at least on</p>
<p>the personal side.</p>
<p>But you read this letter, and I can try to pull it up for you if I want.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just this absolutely heartfelt letter to his wife saying how much he loves her even</p>
<p>though she&rsquo;s dead and what she means to him, how no woman can ever measure up to her.</p>
<p>And it shows you that the Feynman that we&rsquo;ve all seen in Surely You&rsquo;re Joking is different</p>
<p>from the Feynman in reality.</p>
<p>And I think the same kind of goes in his science, where he sometimes has this output of being</p>
<p>this aw shucks character, like everyone else is coming in with these fancyfalutin formulas,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just going to try to whittle it down to its essentials, which is so appealing because</p>
<p>we love to see that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But when you get into it, what he was doing was actually quite deep, very much mathematical.</p>
<p>That should go without saying, but I remember reading a book about Feynman in a cafe once,</p>
<p>and this woman looked at me and saw that it was about Feynman.</p>
<p>She was like, oh, I love him.</p>
<p>I read Surely You&rsquo;re Joking.</p>
<p>And she started explaining to me how he was never really a math person.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t understand how that can possibly be a public perception about any physicist,</p>
<p>but for whatever reason, that worked into his art that he shooed off math in place of</p>
<p>true science.</p>
<p>The reality of it is he was deeply in love with math and was much more going in that</p>
<p>direction and had a clicking point into seeing that physics was a way to realize that and</p>
<p>all the creativity that he could output in that direction was instead poured towards</p>
<p>things like fundamental, not even fundamental theories, just emergent phenomena and everything</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>So to answer your actual question, like what, what, what I like about, uh, his way of going</p>
<p>at things is this constant desire to reinvent it for himself.</p>
<p>Like when he would consume papers, the way he&rsquo;d describe it, he&rsquo;s, he would start to</p>
<p>see what problem he was trying to solve and then just try to solve it himself to get a</p>
<p>sense of personal ownership.</p>
<p>And then from there, see what others had done.</p>
<p>Is that how you see problems yourself?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s actually an interesting point when you first are inspired by a certain idea</p>
<p>that you maybe want to teach or visualize or just explore on your own.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re captured by some possibility and magic of it.</p>
<p>Do you read the work of others?</p>
<p>Like do you go through the proofs or do you try to rediscover everything yourself?</p>
<p>So I think the things that I&rsquo;ve learned best and have the deepest ownership of are the</p>
<p>ones that have some element of rediscovery.</p>
<p>The problem is that really slows you down.</p>
<p>And this is for my, for my part, it&rsquo;s actually a big fault.</p>
<p>Like this is part of why I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m not an active researcher.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like at the depth of the field.</p>
<p>A lot of other people are the stuff that I do learn.</p>
<p>I try to learn it really well.</p>
<p>Um, but other times you do need to get through it at a certain pace.</p>
<p>You do need to get to a point of a problem you&rsquo;re trying to solve.</p>
<p>So obviously you need to be well equipped to read things, uh, without that reinvention</p>
<p>component and see how others have done it.</p>
<p>But I think if you choose a few core building blocks along the way and you say, I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>going to try to approach this, um, before I see how this person went at it, I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>going to try to approach it for myself.</p>
<p>No matter what you gain, all sorts of inarticulatable intuitions about that topic, which aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>going to be there.</p>
<p>If you simply go through the proof, for example, you&rsquo;re going to be, um, trying to come up</p>
<p>with counter examples.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to try to come up with, um, intuitive examples, all sorts of things where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>populating your brain with data.</p>
<p>And the ones that you come up with are likely to be different than the one that the text</p>
<p>comes up with and that like lends at a different angle.</p>
<p>So that aspect also slowed Feynman down in a lot of respects.</p>
<p>I think there was a period when like the rest of physics was running away from him.</p>
<p>Um, but in so far as got, it got him to where he was, uh, I, I kind of resonate with that.</p>
<p>I just, I would, I would be nowhere near it cause I not like him at all, but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a, uh, state to aspire to.</p>
<p>You know, just to link in a small point you made that you&rsquo;re not a quote unquote active</p>
<p>researcher, do you, you&rsquo;re swimming often in reasonably good depth about a lot of topics.</p>
<p>Do you sometimes want to like dive deep at a certain moment and say, like, cause you</p>
<p>probably built up a hell of an amazing intuition about what is and isn&rsquo;t true within these</p>
<p>worlds.</p>
<p>Do you ever want to just dive in and see if you can discover something new?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I, I think one of my biggest regrets from undergrad is not having built better relationships</p>
<p>with the professors I had there.</p>
<p>And I think a big part of success and research is that element of like mentorship and like</p>
<p>people giving you the kind of scaffolded problems to carry along for my own like goals right</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>I feel like, um, I&rsquo;m pretty good at exposing math to others and like want to continue doing</p>
<p>that for my personal learning.</p>
<p>I, are you familiar with like the hedgehog Fox dynamic?</p>
<p>I think this was, um, either the ancient Greeks came up with it or it was pretended to be</p>
<p>something drawn from the ancient Greeks that I don&rsquo;t know who to point it to, but the probably</p>
<p>Mark Twain.</p>
<p>It is that you&rsquo;ve got two types of people or especially two types of researchers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the Fox that knows many different things and then the hedgehog that knows one</p>
<p>thing very deeply.</p>
<p>So like von Neumann would have been the Fox.</p>
<p>Obviously someone who knows many different things, just very foundational, a lot of different</p>
<p>fields.</p>
<p>Um, Einstein would have been more of a hedge thinking really deeply about one particular</p>
<p>thing and both are very necessary for making progress.</p>
<p>Um, so between those two, I would definitely see myself as like the Fox where, uh, I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>try to get my pause in like a whole bunch of different things.</p>
<p>And at the moment I just think I don&rsquo;t know enough of anything to make like a significant</p>
<p>contribution to any of them.</p>
<p>But I do see value in, um, like having a decently deep understanding of a wide variety of things.</p>
<p>Like most people who, uh, know computer science really deeply don&rsquo;t necessarily know physics</p>
<p>very deeply or, uh, many of the aspects, like different fields in math, even let&rsquo;s say you</p>
<p>have like an analytic number theory versus an algebraic number theory.</p>
<p>Like these two things end up being related to very different fields.</p>
<p>Like some of them more complex analysis, some of them more like algebraic geometry.</p>
<p>And then when you just go out so far as to take those adjacent fields, place one, you</p>
<p>know, PhD student into a seminar of another ones, they don&rsquo;t understand what the other</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s saying at all.</p>
<p>Like you take the complex analysis specialist inside the algebraic geometry seminar, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>as lost as you or I would be.</p>
<p>But I think, uh, going around and like trying to have some sense of what this big picture</p>
<p>is certainly has personal value for me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I would ever make like new contributions in those fields, but I do think</p>
<p>I could make new like expositional contributions where there&rsquo;s kind of a notion of, uh, things</p>
<p>that are known, but like haven&rsquo;t been explained very well.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I think most people would agree your videos, your teaching the way you</p>
<p>see the world is fundamentally often new, like you&rsquo;re creating something new and it</p>
<p>almost feels like research, even just like the visualizations, uh, the multidimensional</p>
<p>visualization we&rsquo;ll talk about.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re revealing something very interesting that, uh, yeah, just feels like research feels</p>
<p>like science feels like the cutting edge of the very thing of which like new ideas and</p>
<p>new discoveries are made of.</p>
<p>I do think you&rsquo;re being a little bit more generous than is necessarily.</p>
<p>And I promise that&rsquo;s not even false humility because I sometimes think when I research</p>
<p>a video, I&rsquo;ll learn like 10 times as much as I need for the video itself and it ends</p>
<p>up feeling kind of elementary.</p>
<p>Um, so I have a sense of just how far away like the stuff that I cover is from the actual</p>
<p>depth.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s natural, but I think that could also be a mathematics thing.</p>
<p>I feel like in the machine learning world, you like two weeks in, you feel like you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>basically mastered in mathematics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, everything is either trivial or impossible.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like a shockingly thin line between the two where you can find something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>totally impenetrable.</p>
<p>And then after you get a feel for it, it&rsquo;s like, Oh yeah, that whole, that whole subject</p>
<p>is actually trivial in some way.</p>
<p>So maybe that&rsquo;s what goes on.</p>
<p>Every researcher is just on the other end of that hump and it feels like it&rsquo;s so far</p>
<p>away, but one step actually gets them there.</p>
<p>What do you think about, uh, sort of Feynman&rsquo;s teaching style or another perspective of use</p>
<p>of visualization?</p>
<p>Well his teaching style is interesting because people have described like the Feynman effect</p>
<p>where while you&rsquo;re watching his lectures or while he reading his lectures, everything</p>
<p>makes such perfect sense.</p>
<p>So as an entertainment session, it&rsquo;s wonderful because it gives you this, um, this intellectual</p>
<p>satisfaction that you don&rsquo;t get from anywhere else that you like finally understand it.</p>
<p>But the Feynman effect is that you can&rsquo;t really recall what it is that gave you that insight,</p>
<p>you know, even a week later.</p>
<p>And this is, um, this is true of a lot of books and a lot of lectures where the retention</p>
<p>is never quite what we hope it is.</p>
<p>Um, so there is a risk that, uh, the stuff that I do also fits that same bill where at</p>
<p>best it&rsquo;s giving this kind of intellectual candy on giving a glimpse of feeling like</p>
<p>you understand something, but unless you do something active, like reinventing it yourself,</p>
<p>like doing problems, um, to solidify it, um, even things like space repetition memory to</p>
<p>just make sure that you have like the building blocks of what do all the terms mean.</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re doing something like that, it&rsquo;s not actually going to stick.</p>
<p>So the very same thing that&rsquo;s so admirable about Feynman&rsquo;s lectures, which is how damn</p>
<p>satisfying they are to consume might actually also reveal a little bit of the flaw that</p>
<p>we should as educators all look out for, which is that that does not correlate with long</p>
<p>term learning.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about it a little bit.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve done some interactive stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, even in your videos, the awesome thing that Feynman couldn&rsquo;t do at the time is you</p>
<p>could, since it&rsquo;s programmed, you can like tinker, like play with stuff.</p>
<p>You could take this value and change it.</p>
<p>You can like heroes, take the value of this variable and change it to build up an intuition,</p>
<p>to move along the surface or to, to change the shape of something.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s almost an equivalent of you doing it yourself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not quite there, but you as a viewer, um, yeah, do you think there&rsquo;s some value</p>
<p>in that interactive element?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, so what&rsquo;s interesting is you&rsquo;re saying that, and the videos are non interactive</p>
<p>in the sense that there&rsquo;s a play button and a pause button.</p>
<p>Um, and you could ask like, Hey, while you&rsquo;re programming these things, why don&rsquo;t you program</p>
<p>it into an interactable version?</p>
<p>You know, make it a Jupiter notebook that people can play with, which I should do.</p>
<p>And that like would be better.</p>
<p>I think the thing about interactives though is most people consuming them, um, just sort</p>
<p>of consume what the author had in mind.</p>
<p>Uh, and that&rsquo;s kind of what they want.</p>
<p>Like I have a ton of friends who make interactive explanations.</p>
<p>And when you look into the analytics of how people use them, there&rsquo;s a small sliver that</p>
<p>genuinely use it as a playground to have experiments.</p>
<p>And maybe that small sliver is actually who you&rsquo;re targeting and the rest don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Um, but most people consume it just as a piece of, um, like well constructed literature that</p>
<p>maybe you tweak with the example a little bit to see what it&rsquo;s getting at.</p>
<p>But in that way, I do think like a video can get most of the benefits of the interactive,</p>
<p>like the interactive app, as long as you make the interactive for yourself and you decide</p>
<p>what the best narrative to spin is.</p>
<p>Um, as a more concrete example, like my process with, I made this video about, um, SIR models</p>
<p>for epidemics and it&rsquo;s like this agent based bottling thing where you tweak some things</p>
<p>about how the epidemic spreads and you want to see how that affects its evolution.</p>
<p>Um, my, my, uh, format for making that was very different than others where rather than</p>
<p>scripting it ahead of time, I just made the playground and then I played a bunch, uh,</p>
<p>and then I saw what stories there were to tell within that.</p>
<p>Um,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>So your, your video had that kind of structure, it had, uh, like five or six stories or whatever</p>
<p>it was.</p>
<p>And like, it was basically, okay, here&rsquo;s a simulation, here&rsquo;s a model.</p>
<p>What can we discover with this model?</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s five things I found after playing with it.</p>
<p>Well, cause here, the thing is a way that you could do that project is you make the</p>
<p>model and then you put it out and you say, here&rsquo;s a thing for the world to play with,</p>
<p>like come to my website where you interact with this thing.</p>
<p>Um, and, and people did like sort of remake it in a, um, JavaScript way so that you can</p>
<p>go to that website and you can test your own hypotheses.</p>
<p>But I think a meaningful part of the value to add is not just the technology, but to</p>
<p>give the story around it as well.</p>
<p>And like, that&rsquo;s kind of my job.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just to like make the, uh, the visuals that someone will look at it&rsquo;s to be the one</p>
<p>to decide what&rsquo;s the interesting thing to walk through here.</p>
<p>Um, and even though there&rsquo;s lots of other interesting paths that one could take, that</p>
<p>can be kind of daunting when you&rsquo;re just sitting there in a sandbox and you&rsquo;re given this</p>
<p>tool with like five different sliders and you&rsquo;re told to like play and discover things.</p>
<p>Where do you do?</p>
<p>What do you start?</p>
<p>What are my hypotheses?</p>
<p>What should I be asking?</p>
<p>Like a little bit of guidance in that direction can be what actually sparks curiosity to make</p>
<p>someone want to, um, imagine more about it.</p>
<p>A few videos I&rsquo;ve seen you do, I don&rsquo;t know how often you do it, but there&rsquo;s almost a</p>
<p>tangential like pause where you, here&rsquo;s a cool thing you say like, here&rsquo;s a cool thing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s outside the scope of this video essentially, but I&rsquo;ll leave it to you as homework essentially</p>
<p>to like figure out it&rsquo;s a cool thing to explore.</p>
<p>I wish I could say that wasn&rsquo;t a function of laziness and that&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;ve worked</p>
<p>so hard on making the 20 minutes already that to extend it out even further, it would take</p>
<p>more time.</p>
<p>And one of your cooler videos, the homomorphic, like from the Mobius strip to this, yeah,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the super and you&rsquo;re like, yeah, you can&rsquo;t, uh, you can&rsquo;t transform the Mobius</p>
<p>strip into a, into a surface without it intersecting itself, but I&rsquo;ll leave it to you to see why</p>
<p>that is.</p>
<p>Well, I hope that&rsquo;s not exactly how I phrase it because I think what my hope would be is</p>
<p>that I leave it to you to think about why you would expect that to be true and then</p>
<p>to want to know what aspects of a Mobius strip do you want to formalize such that you can</p>
<p>prove that intuition that you have because at some point now you&rsquo;re starting to invent</p>
<p>algebraic topology.</p>
<p>If you have these vague instincts like I want to get this Mobius strip, I want to, um, fit</p>
<p>it such that it&rsquo;s all above the plane, but it&rsquo;s boundary sits exactly on the plane.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I can do that without crossing itself, but that feels really vague.</p>
<p>How do I formalize it?</p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;re starting to formalize that, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to get you to try to come</p>
<p>up with a definition for what it means to be orientable or non orientable.</p>
<p>And like once you have that motivation, a lot of the otherwise arbitrary things that</p>
<p>are sitting at the very beginning of a topology stack textbook start to make a little more</p>
<p>sense.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I mean that, that whole video beautifully was a motivation for topology school.</p>
<p>That was my, well, my hope with that is I feel like topology is, um, I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s taught wrong, but I do think sometimes it&rsquo;s popularized in the wrong way where, uh,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;ll hear these things that people saying, Oh, topologists, they&rsquo;re very interested</p>
<p>in surfaces that you can bend and stretch, but you can&rsquo;t cut or glue.</p>
<p>Are they?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all sorts of things you can be interested in with random, like imaginative manipulations</p>
<p>of things.</p>
<p>Is that really what like mathematicians are into?</p>
<p>And the short answer is not, not really.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s uh, it&rsquo;s not as if someone was sitting there thinking like, I wonder what the properties</p>
<p>of clay are by add some arbitrary rules about what, when I can&rsquo;t cut it and when I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>glue it instead, it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a ton of pieces of math that, um, can actually be equivalent</p>
<p>to, uh, like these very general structures that&rsquo;s like geometry, except you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>exact distances.</p>
<p>You just want to maintain a notion of closeness.</p>
<p>And once you get it to those general structures, constructing mappings between them translate</p>
<p>into non trivial facts about other parts of math and that I just, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually like popularized.</p>
<p>Um, I don&rsquo;t even think it&rsquo;s emphasized well enough when you&rsquo;re starting to take a topology</p>
<p>class because you kind of have these two problems.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like either it&rsquo;s too squishy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just talking about coffee mugs and donuts, or it&rsquo;s a little bit too rigor first.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re talking about, um, the axiom systems with open sets and an open set is not the</p>
<p>opposite of closed set.</p>
<p>So sorry about that.</p>
<p>Everyone, we have a notion of clopin sets for ones that are both at the same time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not an intuitive axiom system in comparison to other fields</p>
<p>of math.</p>
<p>So you as the student like really have to walk through mud to get there and you&rsquo;re constantly</p>
<p>confused about how this relates to the beautiful things about coffee mugs and Mobius strips</p>
<p>and such.</p>
<p>And it takes a really long time to actually see like see topology in the way that mathematicians</p>
<p>see topology.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think it needs to take that time.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s, um, this is making me feel like I need to make more videos on the topic</p>
<p>because I think you do, but you know, I&rsquo;ve also seen it in my narrow view.</p>
<p>Uh, like, um, I find game theory very beautiful and I know topology has been used, uh, elegantly</p>
<p>to prove things in game theory.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You have like facts that seem very strange.</p>
<p>Like I could tell you, you stir your coffee and um, after you stir it and like, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say all the molecules settled to like not moving again, one of the molecules will be</p>
<p>basically in the same position it was before.</p>
<p>Um, you have all sorts of fixed point theorems like this, right?</p>
<p>That kind of fixed point theorem directly relevant to Nash equilibriums, right?</p>
<p>Um, so you can imagine popularizing it by describing the coffee fact, but then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>left to wonder like who cares about if a molecule of coffee like stays in the same spot?</p>
<p>Is this what we&rsquo;re paying our mathematicians for?</p>
<p>Um, you have this very elegant mapping onto economics in a way that&rsquo;s very concrete or</p>
<p>very, I shouldn&rsquo;t say concrete, very, uh, tangible, like actually adds value to people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>lives through the predictions that it makes.</p>
<p>Uh, but that line isn&rsquo;t always drawn because like you have to get a little bit technical</p>
<p>in order to properly draw that line out, um, and often I think popularized forms of media</p>
<p>just shy away from being a little too technical for sure.</p>
<p>Uh, by the way, for people who are watching the video, I do not condone the message in</p>
<p>this mug.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only one I have, which is this.</p>
<p>The snuggle is real.</p>
<p>By the way, for anyone watching, I do condone the message of that mug.</p>
<p>The snuggle is real.</p>
<p>Okay, so you mentioned the SIR model.</p>
<p>I think, uh, there are certain ideas there of growth of exponential growth.</p>
<p>What maybe have you learned about, um, pandemics from, from making that video?</p>
<p>Because it was kind of exploratory.</p>
<p>You were kind of building up an intuition and it&rsquo;s, again, people should watch the video.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of an abstract view.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really modeling in detail.</p>
<p>The whole field of epidemiology, those, those people, they go really far in terms of modeling,</p>
<p>like how people move about.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen it, but like there is the mobility patterns, like how, like the</p>
<p>track, like how many people you encounter in a certain situations when you go to a school,</p>
<p>when you go to a mall, they like model every aspect of that for a particular city.</p>
<p>Like they have maps of actual city streets.</p>
<p>They model it really well and natural patterns of the people have it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t do any of that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just doing an abstract model to explore different ideas of simple pedigree.</p>
<p>Well, because I don&rsquo;t want to pretend like an epidemiologist, I&rsquo;m an epidemiologist.</p>
<p>Like we have a ton of armchair epidemiologists and the spirit of that was more like, uh,</p>
<p>can we through a little bit of play, uh, draw like reasonable ish conclusions.</p>
<p>Um, and also just like, uh, get ourselves in a position where we can judge the validity</p>
<p>of a model.</p>
<p>Like, I think people should look at that and they should criticize it.</p>
<p>They should point to all the ways that it&rsquo;s wrong because it&rsquo;s definitely naive, right?</p>
<p>And the way that it&rsquo;s set up.</p>
<p>Um, but to say like what, what lessons from that hold, like thinking about the are not</p>
<p>value and what that represents and what it can imply.</p>
<p>Um, so are not is if you are infectious and you&rsquo;re in a population which is completely</p>
<p>susceptible, uh, what&rsquo;s the average number of people that you&rsquo;re going to infect during</p>
<p>your infectiousness?</p>
<p>Um, so certainly during the beginning of an epidemic, this basically gives you kind of</p>
<p>the, um, the exponential growth rate.</p>
<p>Like if every person infects two others, you&rsquo;ve got that one, two, four, eight, uh, exponential</p>
<p>growth pattern.</p>
<p>Um, as it goes on and, uh, let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s something, um, uh, endemic where you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>like a ton of people who have had it, uh, and are recovered, then, uh, you, you would,</p>
<p>the are not value doesn&rsquo;t tell you that as directly because a lot of the people you interact</p>
<p>with aren&rsquo;t susceptible, but in the early phases it does.</p>
<p>Um, and this is like the fundamental constant that it seems like epidemiologists look at</p>
<p>and you know, the whole goal is to get that down.</p>
<p>If you can get it below one, then it&rsquo;s no longer epidemic.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s equal to one, then it&rsquo;s endemic, um, and it&rsquo;s above one, then your epidemic.</p>
<p>So, uh, like just teaching what that value is and giving some intuitions on how do certain</p>
<p>changes in behavior change that value and then what does that imply for exponential</p>
<p>growth?</p>
<p>I think those are, um, general enough lessons and they&rsquo;re like resilient to all of the</p>
<p>chaoses of the world, um, that it&rsquo;s still like valid to take from the video.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the interesting aspects of that is just exponential growth and we think</p>
<p>about growth.</p>
<p>Is that the one of the first times you&rsquo;ve done a video on, on, uh, no, of course not</p>
<p>the whole, uh, well there&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So</p>
<p>sure.</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;ve done a lot of videos about exponential growth in the circular direction, uh, only</p>
<p>minimal in the normal direction.</p>
<p>I mean, another way to ask, like, do you think we&rsquo;re able to reason intuitively about exponential</p>
<p>growth?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, um, I think it&rsquo;s extremely intuitive to humans and then we train it out of ourselves</p>
<p>such that it&rsquo;s then really not intuitive and then I think it can become intuitive again</p>
<p>when you study a technical field.</p>
<p>Uh, so what I mean by that is, um, have you ever heard of these studies where in a, uh,</p>
<p>like anthropological setting where you&rsquo;re studying a group that has been disassociated</p>
<p>from a lot of like modern society and you ask what number is between one and nine and</p>
<p>maybe you would ask you, you&rsquo;ve got like one rock and you&rsquo;ve got nine rocks, you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>what pile is halfway in between these and our instinct is usually to say five.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the number that sits right between one and nine.</p>
<p>Um, but sometimes when a numeracy and, uh, the kind of just basic arithmetic that we</p>
<p>have isn&rsquo;t in a society, the natural instinct is three because it&rsquo;s, uh, in between in an</p>
<p>exponential sense and a geometric sense that, uh, one is three times bigger and then the</p>
<p>next one is three times bigger than that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s, you know, if you have one friend versus a hundred friends, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in between that?</p>
<p>Ten friends seems like the social status in between those two states.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like deeply intuitive to us to think logarithmically like that.</p>
<p>Um, and for some reason we kind of train it out of ourselves to start thinking linearly</p>
<p>about things.</p>
<p>So in the sense, yeah, the early, early basic math is, uh, yeah, forces us to take a step</p>
<p>back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the same criticism if there&rsquo;s any of science is the lessons of science make</p>
<p>us like see the world in a slightly narrow sense to where we, we have an over exaggerated</p>
<p>confidence that we understand everything as opposed to just understanding a small slice</p>
<p>of it.</p>
<p>But I think that probably only really goes for small numbers cause the real counterintuitive</p>
<p>thing about exponential growth is like as the numbers start to get big.</p>
<p>So I bet if you took that same setup and you asked them, oh, if I keep tripling the size</p>
<p>of this rock pile, you know, um, seven times, how big will it be?</p>
<p>I bet it would be surprisingly big even to like an a society without numeracy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the side of it that, um, I think is pretty counterintuitive to us, uh, but</p>
<p>that you can basically train into people like I think computer scientists and physicists</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re looking at the early numbers of, um, like COVID were, they were the ones</p>
<p>thinking like, oh God, this is following an exact exponential curve.</p>
<p>Um, and I heard that from a number of people, uh, so it&rsquo;s, and, and almost all of them are</p>
<p>like techies in some capacity, probably just cause I like live in the Bay area, but, but</p>
<p>for sure they, they&rsquo;re cognizant of this kind of, this kind of growth is present in a lot</p>
<p>of natural systems and a lot of, in a lot of, in a lot of systems.</p>
<p>Uh, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen like, I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of ways to visualize this obviously,</p>
<p>but Raker as well, I think was the one that had this like chess board where, um, every,</p>
<p>every square on the chess board, you double the number of stones or something in that</p>
<p>chess board.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard, this is like an old proverb where it&rsquo;s like, you know, someone, the King offered</p>
<p>him a gift and he said, ah, the only gift I would like very modest, give me a single</p>
<p>grain of rice for the first chess board and then two grains of rice for the next square.</p>
<p>Then twice that for the next square and just continue on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my only modest ask your sire and like, it&rsquo;s all, you know, more grains of rice than</p>
<p>there are, uh, anything in the world, um, by the time you get to the end.</p>
<p>And I, I, my intuition falls apart there, like, I would have never predicted that, like</p>
<p>for some reason, that&rsquo;s a really compelling, uh, illustration, how poorly breaks down.</p>
<p>Just like you said, maybe we&rsquo;re okay for the first few piles, but after, uh, of rocks,</p>
<p>but after a while it&rsquo;s game over.</p>
<p>You know, the other classic example for, um, gauging someone&rsquo;s intuitive understanding</p>
<p>of exponential growth is, uh, I&rsquo;ve got like a Lily pad on a, on like really big lake,</p>
<p>um, like lake Michigan and that Lily pad replicates, it doubles, um, one day and then it doubles</p>
<p>the next day and it doubles the next day.</p>
<p>Um, and after 50 days, um, it actually is going to cover the entire lake.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So after how many days does it cover half the lake?</p>
<p>49.</p>
<p>So you, you have a good instinct for exponential growth.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I think a lot of, uh, like the knee jerk reaction is sometimes to think that it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>half the amount of time or to at least be like surprised that like after 49 days, you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>only covered half of it.</p>
<p>Um, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the reason you heard a pause for me.</p>
<p>Um, I literally thought that can&rsquo;t be right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So even when you know the fact and you do the division, it&rsquo;s like, wow.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve gotten like that whole time and then day 49, it&rsquo;s only covering half.</p>
<p>And then after that it gets the whole thing.</p>
<p>But I think you can make that even more visceral if rather than going one day before you say</p>
<p>how long until, um, it&rsquo;s covered 1% of the lake, right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, uh, so what would that be?</p>
<p>Um, how many times you have to double to get over a hundred, like seven, six and a half</p>
<p>times, something like that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So at that point you&rsquo;re looking at 43, 44 days into it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not even at 1% of the lake.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve, you&rsquo;ve experienced, you know, 44 out of 50 days and you&rsquo;re like, ah, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just 1% of the lake.</p>
<p>But then next thing you know, it&rsquo;s the entire lake.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re wearing a space X shirt.</p>
<p>So let me ask you, let me ask you one, one person who talks about exponential, you know,</p>
<p>just the miracle of the exponential function in general is Elon Musk.</p>
<p>So he kind of advocates the idea of exponential thinking, you know, realizing that technological</p>
<p>development can, at least in the short term, follow exponential improvement, which breaks</p>
<p>apart our intuition, our ability to reason about what is and isn&rsquo;t impossible.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s a big one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good leadership kind of style of saying like, look, the thing that everyone thinks</p>
<p>is impossible is actually possible because exponentials.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s your sense about, um, about that kind of way to see the world?</p>
<p>Well, so I think it&rsquo;s, um, it can be very inspiring to note when something like Moore&rsquo;s</p>
<p>law is another great example where you have this exponential pattern that holds shockingly</p>
<p>well.</p>
<p>Um, and it enables, um, just better lives to be led.</p>
<p>I think the people who took Moore&rsquo;s law seriously in the sixties, we&rsquo;re seeing that, wow, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not going to be too long before like these giant computers that are either batch processing</p>
<p>or time shared, you could actually have one small enough to put on your desk on top of</p>
<p>your desk and you could do things.</p>
<p>And if they took it seriously, like you have people predicting smartphones like a long</p>
<p>time ago.</p>
<p>Um, and it&rsquo;s only out of like kind of this, I don&rsquo;t want to say faith in exponentials,</p>
<p>but an understanding that that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more interesting I think is to, um, really understand why exponential growth happens</p>
<p>and that the mechanism behind it is when the rate of change is proportional to the thing</p>
<p>in and of itself.</p>
<p>So the reason that technology would grow exponentially is only going to be if, um, the rate of progress</p>
<p>is proportional to the amount that you have.</p>
<p>So that the software you write enables you to write more software.</p>
<p>Um, and I think we see this with the internet, like the advent of the internet makes it faster</p>
<p>to learn things, which makes it faster to, uh, create new things.</p>
<p>Um, I think this is, uh, oftentimes why like investment will grow exponentially that the</p>
<p>more resources a company has, if it knows how to use them, well, the more, uh, the more</p>
<p>it can actually grow.</p>
<p>So, I mean, you know, you referenced Elon Musk.</p>
<p>I think he seems to really be into vertically integrating his companies.</p>
<p>I think a big part of that is because you have the sense, what you want is to make sure</p>
<p>that the things that you develop, you have ownership of in the, they enable further development</p>
<p>of the adjacent parts, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just this, you, you see a curve and you&rsquo;re blindly drawing a line through</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s much more interesting is to ask, when do you have this proportional growth property?</p>
<p>Um, because then you can also recognize when it breaks down, like in an epidemic, as you</p>
<p>approach saturation, that would break down.</p>
<p>Um, as you do anything that, uh, skews what that proportionality constant is, um, you</p>
<p>can make it maybe not break down as being an exponential, but it can seriously slow</p>
<p>what that exponential rate is.</p>
<p>This is the opposite of a pandemic is you want, in terms of ideas, you want to minimize</p>
<p>barriers that, um, prevent the spread.</p>
<p>You want to maximize the spread of impact.</p>
<p>So like you want it to, to grow when you&rsquo;re doing technological development is so that</p>
<p>you do hold up that rate holds up.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s almost like, uh, like an operational challenge of like how you run</p>
<p>a company, how you run a group of people is that any one invention has a ripple that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unstopped.</p>
<p>And that ripple effect then has its own ripple effects and so on.</p>
<p>And that continues.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like Moore&rsquo;s law is fascinating.</p>
<p>And the, like on a psychological level and a human level, cause it&rsquo;s not exponential.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s just a consistent set of like what you would call like S curves, which is like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s constantly like breakthrough innovations nonstop.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point.</p>
<p>Like it might not actually be an example of exponentials because of something which grows</p>
<p>in proportion to itself.</p>
<p>But instead it&rsquo;s almost like a benchmark that was set out that everyone&rsquo;s been pressured</p>
<p>to meet.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like all these innovations and micro inventions along the way, rather than some</p>
<p>consistent sit back and just let the lily pad grow across the lake phenomenon.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also that there&rsquo;s a human psychological level for sure of like the four minute mile,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s something about it.</p>
<p>Like saying that, look, there is, you know, Moore&rsquo;s law, it&rsquo;s a law.</p>
<p>So like it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s certainly an achievable thing.</p>
<p>You know, we achieved it for the last decade, for the last two decades, for the last three</p>
<p>decades, you just keep going and it somehow makes it happen.</p>
<p>I mean, it makes people, I&rsquo;m continuously surprised in this world how few people do</p>
<p>the best work in the world, like in that particular, whatever that field is, like it&rsquo;s very often</p>
<p>that like the genius, I mean, you couldn&rsquo;t argue that community matters, but it&rsquo;s certain</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve been in groups of engineers where like one person is clearly like doing an incredible</p>
<p>amount of work and just is the genius and it&rsquo;s fascinating to see basically it&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of the Steve Jobs idea is maybe the whole point is to create an atmosphere where the</p>
<p>genius can discover themselves, like have the opportunity to do the best work of their</p>
<p>life and yeah, and that the exponential is just milking that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like rippling the idea that it&rsquo;s possible and that idea that it&rsquo;s possible finds the</p>
<p>right people for the four minute mile and the idea that it&rsquo;s possible finds the right</p>
<p>runners to run it and then expose the number of people who can run faster than four minutes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting to, I don&rsquo;t know, basically the positive way to see that is</p>
<p>most of us are way more intelligent, have way more potential than we ever realized.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s kind of depressing, but I mean like the ceiling for most of us is much higher</p>
<p>than we ever realized.</p>
<p>That is true.</p>
<p>A good book to read if you want that sense is Peak, which essentially talks about peak</p>
<p>performance in a lot of different ways, like chess, London cab drivers, how many pushups</p>
<p>people can do, short term memory tasks, and it&rsquo;s meant to be like a concrete manifesto</p>
<p>about deliberate practice and such, but the one sensation you come out with is wow, no</p>
<p>matter how good people are at something, they can get better and like way better than we</p>
<p>think they could.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s actually related to exponential growth, but I do think it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>true phenomenon that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s certainly no law of exponential growth in human innovation.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well kind of, there is.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very interesting to see when innovations in one field allow for innovations</p>
<p>in another.</p>
<p>Like the advent of computing seems like a prerequisite for the advent of chaos theory.</p>
<p>You have this truth about physics and the world that in theory could be known.</p>
<p>You could find Lorenz&rsquo;s equations without computers, but in practice, it was just never</p>
<p>going to be analyzed that way unless you were doing like a bunch of simulations and that</p>
<p>you could computationally see these models.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like physics allowed for computers, computers allowed for better physics, and</p>
<p>you know, wash, rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>That self proportionality, that&rsquo;s exponential.</p>
<p>So I think I wouldn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s too far to say that that&rsquo;s a law of some kind.</p>
<p>Yeah, a fundamental law of the universe is that these descendants of apes will exponentially</p>
<p>improve their technology and one day be taken over by the AGI.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s built in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll make the video game fun, whoever created this thing.</p>
<p>So I mean, since you&rsquo;re wearing a space X shirt, let me ask.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize I was wearing a space X shirt.</p>
<p>I apologize.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on point.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s on topic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first crewed mission out into space since the space shuttle and just by first</p>
<p>time ever by a commercial company, I mean, it&rsquo;s an incredible accomplishment, I think,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also just an incredible, it inspires imagination amongst people that this is the</p>
<p>first step in a long, vibrant journey of humans into space.</p>
<p>So how do you feel?</p>
<p>Is this exciting to you?</p>
<p>Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>The idea of seeing it basically done by smaller entities instead of by governments.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a heavy collaboration between space X and NASA in this case, but moving</p>
<p>in the direction of not necessarily requiring an entire country and its government to make</p>
<p>it happen, but that you can have something closer to a single company doing it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not there yet because it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re unilaterally saying like we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>shooting people up into space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a sign that we&rsquo;re able to do more powerful things with smaller groups of people.</p>
<p>I find that inspiring.</p>
<p>Innovate quickly.</p>
<p>I hope we see people land on Mars in my lifetime.</p>
<p>Do you think we will?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I mean, I think there&rsquo;s a ton of challenges there, right?</p>
<p>Like radiation being kind of the biggest one.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a ton of people who look at that and say, why?</p>
<p>Why would you want to do that?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s let the robots do the science for us.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s enough people who are genuinely inspired about broadening the worlds</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve touched or people who think about things like backing up the light of consciousness</p>
<p>with super long term visions of terraforming, like as long as there&rsquo;s a backing up the</p>
<p>light of consciousness.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I thought that if Earth goes to hell, we&rsquo;ve got to have a backup somewhere.</p>
<p>A lot of people see that as pretty out there and it&rsquo;s like not in the short term future,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s an inspiring thought.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a reason to get up in the morning and I feel like most employees at SpaceX feel</p>
<p>that way too.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll colonize Mars one day?</p>
<p>No idea.</p>
<p>Like either AGI kills us first or if we&rsquo;re like allowed, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;ll take us</p>
<p>for allowed.</p>
<p>Well, like honestly, it would take such a long time.</p>
<p>Like, okay, you might have a small colony, right?</p>
<p>Something like what you see in the Martian, but not like people living comfortably there.</p>
<p>But if you want to talk about actual like second Earth kind of stuff, that&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>way far out there and the future moves so fast that it&rsquo;s hard to predict.</p>
<p>We might just kill ourselves before that even becomes viable.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of possibilities where it could be just, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be on</p>
<p>a planet, we could be floating out in space, have a space faring backup solution that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to deal with the constraints that a planet, I mean, a planet provides a lot of possibilities</p>
<p>and resources, but also has some constraints.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, for me, for some reason, it&rsquo;s a deeply exciting possibility.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All of the people who were like skeptical about it are like, why do we care about going</p>
<p>to Mars?</p>
<p>Like, what makes you care about anything that&rsquo;s inspiring?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>It actually is hard to hear that because exactly as you put it on a philosophical level, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard to say, why do anything?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the people say like, I&rsquo;ve been doing like an insane challenge last 30 something</p>
<p>days.</p>
<p>Your pull ups?</p>
<p>The pull ups and push ups and like, a bunch of people are like, awesome.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re insane, but awesome.</p>
<p>And then some people are like, why?</p>
<p>Why do anything?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a calling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m with JFK a little bit is because we do these things because they&rsquo;re hard.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something in the human spirit that says like, same with like a math problem.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something you fail once and it&rsquo;s like this feeling that, you know what, I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to back down from this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something to be discovered in overcoming this thing.</p>
<p>So what I like about it is, and I also like this about the moon missions, sure, it&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of arbitrary, but you can&rsquo;t move the target.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t make it easier and say that you&rsquo;ve accomplished the goal.</p>
<p>And when that happens, it just demands actual innovation, right?</p>
<p>Like protecting humans from the radiation in space on the flight there while they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>hard problem demands innovation.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t move the goalpost to make that easier.</p>
<p>But certainly the innovations required for things like that will be relevant in a bunch</p>
<p>of other domains too.</p>
<p>So like the idea of doing something merely because it&rsquo;s hard, it&rsquo;s like loosely productive.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>But as long as you can&rsquo;t move the goalposts, there&rsquo;s probably going to be these secondary</p>
<p>benefits that like we should all strive for.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s hard to formulate the Mars colonization problem as something that has a deadline,</p>
<p>which is the problem.</p>
<p>But if there was a deadline, then the amount of things we would come up with by forcing</p>
<p>ourselves to figure out how to colonize that place would be just incredible.</p>
<p>This is what people, like the internet didn&rsquo;t get created because people sat down and try</p>
<p>to figure out how do I, you know, send TikTok videos of myself dancing to people.</p>
<p>They, you know, it was, there&rsquo;s an application.</p>
<p>I mean, actually I don&rsquo;t even know what do you think the application for the internet</p>
<p>was when it was, it must&rsquo;ve been very low level basic network communication within DARPA,</p>
<p>like military based, like how do I send like a networking, how do I send information securely</p>
<p>between two places?</p>
<p>Maybe it was an encryption.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m totally speaking totally outside of my knowledge, but like it was probably intended</p>
<p>for a very narrow, small group of people.</p>
<p>Well, so I mean, it was, there was like this small community of people who are really interested</p>
<p>in timesharing computing and like interactive computing in contrast with a batch processing.</p>
<p>And then the idea that as you set up like a timesharing center, basically meaning kind</p>
<p>of multiple people like logged in and using that like central computer, why not make it</p>
<p>accessible to others?</p>
<p>And this was kind of what I had always thought like, Oh, is this like fringe group that was</p>
<p>interested in this new kind of computing and they all like got themselves together.</p>
<p>But the thing is like DARPA wouldn&rsquo;t act, you wouldn&rsquo;t have the U S government funding</p>
<p>that just for the funds of it, right?</p>
<p>In some sense, that&rsquo;s what ARPA was all about was like just really advanced research for</p>
<p>the sake of having advanced research and it doesn&rsquo;t have to pay out with utility soon.</p>
<p>But the core parts of its development were happening like in the middle of the Vietnam</p>
<p>war when there was budgetary constraints all over the place.</p>
<p>I only learned this recently, actually, like if you look at the documents, basically justifying</p>
<p>the budget for the ARPANET as they were developing it, and not just keeping it where it was,</p>
<p>but actively growing it while all sorts of other departments were having their funding</p>
<p>cut because of the war, a big part of it was national defense in terms of having like a</p>
<p>more robust communication system, like the idea of packet switching versus circuit switching.</p>
<p>You could kind of make this case that in some calamitous circumstance where a central location</p>
<p>gets nuked, this is a much more resilient way to still have your communication lines</p>
<p>that like traditional telephone lines weren&rsquo;t as resilient to, which I just found very interesting.</p>
<p>Even something that we see as so happy go lucky is just a bunch of computer nerds trying</p>
<p>to get like interactive computing out there.</p>
<p>The actual thing that made it funded and thing that made it advance when it did was because</p>
<p>of this direct national security question and concern.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve read it.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve been meaning to read it, but Neil deGrasse Tyson actually came out</p>
<p>with a book that talks about like science in the context of the military, like basically</p>
<p>saying all the great science we&rsquo;ve done in the 20th century was like because of the military.</p>
<p>He paints a positive, it&rsquo;s not like a critical, a lot of people say like military industrial</p>
<p>complex and so on.</p>
<p>Another way to see the military and national security is like a source of, like you said,</p>
<p>headlines and like hard things you can&rsquo;t move, like almost like scaring yourself into being</p>
<p>productive.</p>
<p>It is that.</p>
<p>I mean, Manhattan Project is a perfect example, probably the quintessential example.</p>
<p>That one is a little bit more macabre than others because of like what they were building,</p>
<p>but in terms of how many focused, smart hours of human intelligence get pointed towards</p>
<p>a topic per day, you&rsquo;re just maxing it out with that sense of worry.</p>
<p>In that context, everyone there was saying like, we&rsquo;ve got to get the bomb before Hitler</p>
<p>does and that just lights a fire under you that I, again, like the circumstances macabre,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s actually pretty healthy, especially for researchers that are otherwise</p>
<p>going to be really theoretical to take these like theorizers and say, make this real physical</p>
<p>thing happen.</p>
<p>Meaning a lot of it is going to be unsexy, a lot of it&rsquo;s going to be like young Feynman</p>
<p>sitting there kind of inventing a notion of computation in order to like compute what</p>
<p>they needed to compute more quickly with like the rudimentary automated tools that they</p>
<p>had available.</p>
<p>I think you see this with Bell Labs also where you&rsquo;ve got otherwise very theorizing minds</p>
<p>in very pragmatic contexts that I think is like really helpful for the theory as well</p>
<p>as for the applications.</p>
<p>I think that stuff can be positive for progress.</p>
<p>You mentioned Bell Labs and Manhattan Project.</p>
<p>This kind of makes me curious for the things you&rsquo;ve create, which are quite singular.</p>
<p>Like if you look at all YouTube or just not YouTube, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just teaching content, art, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yep, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s grant, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s unique.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re teaching style and everything.</p>
<p>Does it, Manhattan Project and Bell Labs was like famously a lot of brilliant people, but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of them.</p>
<p>They play off of each other.</p>
<p>So like my question for you is that, does it get lonely?</p>
<p>Honestly, that right there, I think is the biggest part of my life that I would like</p>
<p>to change in some way that I look at a Bell Labs type situation and I&rsquo;m like, God damn,</p>
<p>I love that whole situation and I&rsquo;m so jealous of it and you&rsquo;re like reading about Hamming</p>
<p>and then you see that he also shared an office with Shannon and you&rsquo;re like, of course he</p>
<p>did.</p>
<p>Of course they shared an office.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how these ideas get.</p>
<p>And they actually probably very likely worked separately.</p>
<p>Yeah, totally, totally separate.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a literally, and sorry to interrupt, there&rsquo;s a literally magic that happens when</p>
<p>you run into each other, like on the way to like getting a snack or something.</p>
<p>Conversations you overhear, it&rsquo;s other projects you&rsquo;re pulled into, it&rsquo;s like puzzles that</p>
<p>colleagues are sharing, like all of that.</p>
<p>I have some extent of it just because I try to stay well connected in communities of people</p>
<p>who think in similar ways.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not in the day to day in the same way, which I would like to fix somehow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the, I would say one of the biggest, well, one of the many drawbacks,</p>
<p>negative things about this current pandemic is that whatever the term is, but like chance</p>
<p>collisions are significantly reduced.</p>
<p>I saw, I don&rsquo;t know why I saw this, but on my brother&rsquo;s work calendar, he had a scheduled</p>
<p>slot with someone that he scheduled a meeting and the title of the whole meeting was no</p>
<p>specific agenda.</p>
<p>I just missed the happenstance serendipitous conversations that we used to have, which</p>
<p>the pandemic and remote work has so cruelly taken away from us.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s the way to do it.</p>
<p>You just schedule those things, schedule the serendipitous interaction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, I mean, you can&rsquo;t do it in an academic setting, but it&rsquo;s basically like</p>
<p>going to a bar and sitting there just for the strangers you might meet, just the strangers</p>
<p>or striking up a conversation with strangers on the train.</p>
<p>Harder to do when you&rsquo;re deeply like maybe myself or maybe a lot of academic types who</p>
<p>are like introverted and avoid human contact as much as possible.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s nice when it&rsquo;s forced, those chance collisions, but maybe scheduling is a possibility</p>
<p>but for the most part, do you work alone?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you struggle a lot.</p>
<p>You probably hit moments when you look at this and you say like, this is the wrong way</p>
<p>to show it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long way to visualize it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making it too hard for myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going down the wrong direction.</p>
<p>This is too long.</p>
<p>This is too short.</p>
<p>All those self doubt that could be paralyzing.</p>
<p>What do you do in those moments?</p>
<p>I actually much prefer like work to be a solitary affair for me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a personality quirk.</p>
<p>I would like it to be in an environment with others and like collaborative in the sense</p>
<p>of ideas exchanged.</p>
<p>But those phenomena you&rsquo;re describing when you say this is too long, this is too short,</p>
<p>this visualization sucks, it&rsquo;s way easier to say that to yourself than it is to say</p>
<p>to a collaborator.</p>
<p>And I know that&rsquo;s just a thing that I&rsquo;m not good at.</p>
<p>So in that way, it&rsquo;s very easy to just throw away a script because the script isn&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to tell someone else they should do the same.</p>
<p>Actually last time we talked, I think it was like very close to me talking Don Knuth was</p>
<p>kind of cool.</p>
<p>Like two people that&hellip;</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe you got that interview.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the hard&hellip;</p>
<p>No, can I brag about something?</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is Don Knuth, after did the interview, he offered to go out to hot</p>
<p>dogs with me.</p>
<p>To get hot dogs.</p>
<p>That was never&hellip;</p>
<p>Like people ask me what&rsquo;s the favorite interview you&rsquo;ve ever done and that has to be&hellip;</p>
<p>But unfortunately I couldn&rsquo;t, I had a thing after.</p>
<p>So I had to turn down Don Knuth.</p>
<p>You missed Knuth dogs?</p>
<p>Knuth dogs.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>So that was a little bragging, but the hot dogs, he&rsquo;s such a sweet.</p>
<p>But the reason I bring that up is he works through problems alone as well.</p>
<p>He prefers that struggle, the struggle of it.</p>
<p>Writers like Stephen King often talk about their process of what they do, what they eat</p>
<p>when they wake up, when they sit down, how they like their desk on a perfectly productive</p>
<p>day.</p>
<p>What they like to do, how long they like to work for, what enables them to think deeply,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Hunter S. Thompson did a lot of drugs.</p>
<p>Everybody has their own thing.</p>
<p>Do you have a thing?</p>
<p>If you were to lay out a perfect productive day, what would that schedule look like do</p>
<p>you think?</p>
<p>Part of that&rsquo;s hard to answer because like the mode of work I do changes a lot from day</p>
<p>to day.</p>
<p>Like some days I&rsquo;m writing.</p>
<p>The thing I have to do is write a script.</p>
<p>Some days I&rsquo;m animating.</p>
<p>The thing I have to do is animate.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;m like working on the animation library.</p>
<p>The thing I have to do is like a little, I&rsquo;m not a software engineer, but something in</p>
<p>the direction of software engineering.</p>
<p>Some days it&rsquo;s like a variant of research.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like learn this topic well and try to learn it differently.</p>
<p>So those are like four very different modes.</p>
<p>Some days it&rsquo;s like get through the email backlog of people I&rsquo;ve been, tasks I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>putting off.</p>
<p>It goes research, scripting, like the idea starts with research and then there&rsquo;s scripting</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s programming and then there&rsquo;s the showtime.</p>
<p>And the research side, by the way, I think a problematic way to do it is to say I&rsquo;m starting</p>
<p>this project and therefore I&rsquo;m starting the research.</p>
<p>Instead it should be that you&rsquo;re like ambiently learning a ton of things just in the background</p>
<p>and then once you feel like you have the understanding for one, you put it on the list of things</p>
<p>that there can be a video for.</p>
<p>Otherwise either you&rsquo;re going to end up roadblocked forever or you&rsquo;re just not going to like have</p>
<p>a good way of talking about it.</p>
<p>But still some of the days it&rsquo;s like the thing to do is learn new things.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the most painful one?</p>
<p>I think you mentioned scripting.</p>
<p>Scripting is yeah, that&rsquo;s the worst.</p>
<p>Yeah, writing is the worst.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your, on a perfectly, so let&rsquo;s take the hardest one.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a perfectly productive day?</p>
<p>You wake up and it&rsquo;s like, damn it, this is the day I need to do some scripting.</p>
<p>And like you didn&rsquo;t do anything the last two days so you came up with excuses to procrastinate</p>
<p>so today must be the day.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wake up early, I guess I exercise and then I turn the internet off.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re writing, yeah, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s required is having the internet off and then maybe</p>
<p>you keep notes on the things that you want to Google when you&rsquo;re allowed to have the</p>
<p>internet again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not great about doing that, but when I do, that makes it happen.</p>
<p>And then when I hit writer&rsquo;s block, like the solution to writer&rsquo;s block is to read.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t even have to be related.</p>
<p>Just read something different just for like 15 minutes, half an hour and then go back</p>
<p>to writing.</p>
<p>That when it&rsquo;s a nice cycle, I think can work very well.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re writing the script, you don&rsquo;t know where it ends, right?</p>
<p>Like you have a problem solving videos.</p>
<p>I know where it ends, expositional videos.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where it ends coming up with a, with the magical thing that makes this</p>
<p>whole story, like ties this whole story together that when does that happen?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the thing that makes it such that a topic gets put on the list of like</p>
<p>videos.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s an issue.</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t start the project unless there&rsquo;s one of those and you have, you have so many</p>
<p>nice bags that you haven&rsquo;t such a big bag of aha moments already that you could just</p>
<p>pull at it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the things.</p>
<p>And one of the sad things about time and that nothing lasts forever and that we&rsquo;re all mortal.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not get into that discussion is, you know, if I see like, even when I ask for people</p>
<p>to ask, like ask, I did a call for questions and people want to ask you questions and so</p>
<p>many requests from people about like certain videos they would love you to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a pile and I think that&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s a sign of like admiration from people for</p>
<p>sure.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like, it makes me sad cause like whenever I see them, people give ideas, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all like very often really good ideas.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s such a, it makes me sad in the same kind of way when I go through</p>
<p>a library or through a bookstore, you see all these amazing books that you&rsquo;ll never</p>
<p>get to open.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>So you gotta enjoy the ones that you have, enjoy the books that are open and don&rsquo;t let</p>
<p>yourself lament the ones that stay closed.</p>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>Is there any other magic to that day?</p>
<p>So do you try to dedicate like a certain number of hours?</p>
<p>Do you, Cal Newport has this deep work kind of idea.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s systematic people who like get really on top of, you know, they checklist of what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to do in the day and they like count their hours.</p>
<p>And I am not a systematic person in that way.</p>
<p>Which is probably a problem.</p>
<p>I very likely would get more done if I was systematic in that way, but that doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>So you talk to me later in life and maybe I&rsquo;ll have like changed my ways and give you</p>
<p>a very different answer.</p>
<p>I think Benjamin Franklin like later in life figured out the rigor is these like very rigorous</p>
<p>schedules and how to be productive.</p>
<p>I think those schedules are much more fun to write.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s very fun to like write a schedule and make a blog post about like the perfect</p>
<p>productive day that like might work for one person.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know how much people get out of like reading them or trying to adopt someone</p>
<p>else&rsquo;s style.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not even sure that they&rsquo;ve ever followed.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re always going to write it as the best version of yourself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to explain the phenomenon of like wanting to get out of the bed, but</p>
<p>not really wanting to get out of the bed and all of that.</p>
<p>And just like zoning out for random reasons or the one that people probably don&rsquo;t touch</p>
<p>at all is I try to check social media once a day, but I&rsquo;m like only.</p>
<p>So I post and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>When I post, I check the previous days.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like my, what I try to do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I do like 90% of the days.</p>
<p>But then I&rsquo;ll go, I&rsquo;ll have like a two week period where it&rsquo;s just like, I&rsquo;m checking</p>
<p>the internet like, I mean, it&rsquo;s some, probably some scary number of times and a lot of people</p>
<p>can resonate with that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a legitimate addiction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a dopamine addiction and it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a problem because as</p>
<p>long as it&rsquo;s the kind of socializing, like if you&rsquo;re actually engaging with friends and</p>
<p>engaging with other people&rsquo;s ideas, uh, I think it can be really useful.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So like for sure I agree with you, but I&rsquo;m, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s definitely an addiction because</p>
<p>for me, I think it&rsquo;s true for a lot of people.</p>
<p>I am very cognizant of the fact I just don&rsquo;t feel that happy.</p>
<p>If I look at a day where I&rsquo;ve checked social media a lot, like if I just aggregate, I did</p>
<p>a self report, I&rsquo;m sure I would find that I&rsquo;m just like literally on like less happy</p>
<p>with my life and myself after I&rsquo;ve done that check.</p>
<p>When I check it once a day, I&rsquo;m very like, I&rsquo;m happy I even like, cause I&rsquo;ve seen it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>One way to measure that is when somebody says something not nice to you on the internet</p>
<p>is like when I check it once a day, I&rsquo;m able to just like, like I smile, like, like I virtually,</p>
<p>I think about them positively, empathetically, I send them love.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t ever respond, but I just feel positively about the whole thing.</p>
<p>If I check it, if I check like more than that, it starts eating at me.</p>
<p>Like it start, there, there&rsquo;s an eating thing that, that happens like anxiety.</p>
<p>It occupies a part of your mind that&rsquo;s not, doesn&rsquo;t seem to be healthy.</p>
<p>Same with, I mean, you, you, you put stuff out on YouTube.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>I think you have a million dimensions that are interesting to you, but yeah, one of,</p>
<p>one of the interesting ones is the study of education and the psychological aspect of</p>
<p>putting stuff up on YouTube.</p>
<p>I like now have completely stopped checking statistics of any kind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve released an episode a 100 with my dad, conversation with my dad.</p>
<p>He checks, he&rsquo;s probably listening to this stop.</p>
<p>He checks the number of views on his, on his video, on his conversation.</p>
<p>So he discovered like a reason he&rsquo;s new to this whole addiction and he just checks and</p>
<p>he like, he&rsquo;ll text me or write to me, I just passed Dawkins and I love that so much.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s, uh, can I tell you a funny story in that effect of like parental use of YouTube?</p>
<p>Uh, early on in the channel, uh, my mom would like text me.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, uh, the channel, the channel has had 990,000 views.</p>
<p>The channel has had 991,000 views.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh, that&rsquo;s cute.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s going to the little part on the about page where you see the total number of channel</p>
<p>views.</p>
<p>No, she didn&rsquo;t know about that.</p>
<p>She had been going every day through all the videos and then adding them up and she thought</p>
<p>she was like doing me this favor of providing me this like global analytic that, uh, otherwise</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be visible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like this addiction where you have some number you want to follow and like, yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny that your dad had this.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people have it.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s probably a beautiful thing for like parents cause they&rsquo;re legitimately,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re proud.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s born of love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>The downside, I feel one, one of them is this is one interesting experience that you probably</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know much about cause comments on your videos are super positive.</p>
<p>Uh, but people judge the quality of how something went.</p>
<p>Like I see that with these conversations by the comments.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m not talking about like, you know, people in their twenties and their thirties.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about like CEOs of major companies who don&rsquo;t have time.</p>
<p>They basically, they literally, this is their evaluation metric.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, Ooh, the comments seem to be positive and that&rsquo;s really concerning to me.</p>
<p>Most important lesson for any content creator to learn is that the commenting public is</p>
<p>not representative of the actual public.</p>
<p>And this is easy to see.</p>
<p>Ask yourself, how often do you write comments on YouTube videos?</p>
<p>Most people will realize I never do it.</p>
<p>Some people realize they do, but the people who realize they never do it should understand</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a sign.</p>
<p>The kind of people who are like you aren&rsquo;t the ones leaving comments.</p>
<p>And I think this is important.</p>
<p>A number of respects, like, uh, in my case, I think I would think my content was better</p>
<p>than it was if I just read comments cause people are super nice.</p>
<p>The thing is the people who are bored by it are, are put off by it in some way or frustrated</p>
<p>by it.</p>
<p>Usually they just go away.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re certainly not going to watch the whole video, much less leave a comment on it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a huge under representation of like negative feedback, like well intentioned</p>
<p>negative feedback because very few people actively do that.</p>
<p>Like watch the whole thing that they dislike, figure out what they disliked, articulate</p>
<p>what they dislike.</p>
<p>Um, there&rsquo;s plenty of negative feedback that&rsquo;s not well intentioned, but um, for like that</p>
<p>golden kind, uh, I think a lot of YouTuber friends I have, uh, at least have gone through</p>
<p>phases of like anxiety about the nature of comments, um, that stem from basically just</p>
<p>this that it&rsquo;s like people who aren&rsquo;t necessarily representative of who they were going for</p>
<p>or misinterpreted what they&rsquo;re trying to say or whatever have you, or we&rsquo;re focusing on</p>
<p>things like personal appearances as opposed to like substance.</p>
<p>Um, and they come away thinking like, oh, that&rsquo;s what everyone thinks, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what everyone&rsquo;s response to this video was.</p>
<p>Um, but a lot of the people who had the reaction you wanted them to have, like they probably</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t write it down.</p>
<p>So very important to learn.</p>
<p>It also translates to, um, realizing that you&rsquo;re not as important as you might think</p>
<p>you are, right?</p>
<p>Because all of the people commenting are the ones who love you the most and are like really</p>
<p>asking you to like create certain things or like mad that you didn&rsquo;t create like a past</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>Um, I don&rsquo;t, I have such a problem.</p>
<p>Like I have a very real problem with making promises about a type of content that I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>make and then either not following up on it soon or just like never following up on it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like the last time we talked, I think prom, I&rsquo;m not sure a promise to me that you&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>music incorporated into your, like, uh, I&rsquo;ll share it with you a private link, but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an example of like what I had in mind.</p>
<p>I like did a version of it, um, and I&rsquo;m like, Oh, I think there&rsquo;s a better version of this</p>
<p>that might exist one day.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s now on the, like the back burner, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s sitting there.</p>
<p>It was like a live performance at this one thing, I think next, next circumstance that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like doing another recorded live performance that like fits having that then in a better</p>
<p>recording context, maybe I&rsquo;ll make it nice in public.</p>
<p>Maybe a while, but exactly.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Um, the point I was going to make those, like, I know I&rsquo;m bad about following up on stuff,</p>
<p>uh, which is an actual problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s born of the fact that I have a sense of what will be like good content when it</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>Um, but this can actually be credibly disheartening because a ton of comments that I see are people</p>
<p>who are like, uh, frustrated, usually in a benevolent way that like I haven&rsquo;t followed</p>
<p>through on like X and X, which I get and I should do that.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s comforting thought for me is that when there&rsquo;s a topic I haven&rsquo;t promised, but</p>
<p>I am working on and I&rsquo;m excited about, it&rsquo;s like the people who would really like this</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s coming and don&rsquo;t know to like comment to that effect and like the</p>
<p>commenting public that I&rsquo;m seeing is not representative of like who I think this other project will</p>
<p>touch meaningfully.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So focus on the future on the thing you&rsquo;re creating now, just like the, uh, yeah, the</p>
<p>art of it.</p>
<p>One of the people is really inspiring to me in that regard because I&rsquo;ve really seen it</p>
<p>in persons, um, Joe Rogan, he doesn&rsquo;t read comments, but not just that he doesn&rsquo;t give</p>
<p>a damn.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>He like legitimate, he&rsquo;s not like clueless about it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, just like the richness and the depth of a smile he has when he just experiences</p>
<p>the moment with you like offline, you can tell he doesn&rsquo;t give a damn about like, like</p>
<p>about anything, about what people think about whether if it&rsquo;s on a podcast, you talk to</p>
<p>them or whether offline about just, it&rsquo;s not there.</p>
<p>Like what other people think, how, how, um, even like what the rest of the day looks like</p>
<p>is just deeply in the moment, uh, or like, especially like is, is what we&rsquo;re doing going</p>
<p>to make for a good Instagram photo or something like that?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t think like that at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s I think for actually quite a lot of people, he&rsquo;s an inspiration in that way, but it was</p>
<p>and in real life, I show that you can be very successful, not giving a damn about, um, about</p>
<p>comments.</p>
<p>And it sounds, it sounds bad not to read comments cause it&rsquo;s like, well, there&rsquo;s a huge number</p>
<p>of people who are deeply passionate about what you do.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re what ignoring them, but at the same time, the nature of our platforms is such</p>
<p>that the cost of listening to all the positive people who are really close to you, who are</p>
<p>incredible people have been, you know, I&rsquo;ve made a great community that you can learn</p>
<p>a lot from the cost of listening to those folks is also the cost of your psychology</p>
<p>slowly being degraded by the natural underlying toxicity of the internet.</p>
<p>Engage with a handful of people deeply rather than like as many people as you can in a shallow</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a good lesson for social media usage.</p>
<p>Um, like platforms in general, like choose, choose just a handful of things to engage</p>
<p>with and engage with it very well in a way that you feel proud of and don&rsquo;t worry about</p>
<p>the rest.</p>
<p>Honestly, I think the best social media platform is texting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my favorite.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my go to social media platform.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, the best social media interactions like real life, not social media, but social</p>
<p>interaction.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>No, no, no question there.</p>
<p>I think everyone should agree with that.</p>
<p>Which sucks because, uh, it&rsquo;s been challenged now with the current situation and we&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to figure out what kind of platform can be created that we can do remote communication</p>
<p>that still is effective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important for education.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important for just the question of education right now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So on that topic, uh, you&rsquo;ve done a series of live streams called lockdown math and you</p>
<p>know, you want live, which is different than you usually do.</p>
<p>Maybe one, can you talk about how that feel?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that experience like like in your own, when you look back, like, is that an effective</p>
<p>way?</p>
<p>Did you find a being able to teach?</p>
<p>And if so, is there a lessons for this world where all of these educators are now trying</p>
<p>to figure out how the heck do I teach remotely?</p>
<p>For me, it was very different, as different as you can get.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on camera, which I&rsquo;m usually not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing it live, which is nerve wracking.</p>
<p>Um, it was a slightly different like level of topics, although realistically I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>talking about things I&rsquo;m interested in no matter what.</p>
<p>I think the reason I did that was this thought that a ton of people are looking to learn</p>
<p>remotely the rate at which I usually put out content is too slow to be actively helpful.</p>
<p>Let me just do some biweekly lectures that if you&rsquo;re looking for a place to point your</p>
<p>students, if you&rsquo;re a student looking for a place to be edified about math, just tune</p>
<p>in at these times.</p>
<p>Um, and in that sense, I think it was, you know, a success for those who followed with</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>It was a really rewarding experience for me to see how people engaged with it.</p>
<p>Um, part of the fun of the live interaction was to actually like I do these live quizzes</p>
<p>and see how people would answer and try to shape the lesson based on that or see what</p>
<p>questions people were asking in the audience.</p>
<p>I would love to, if I did more things like that in the future, kind of tighten that feedback</p>
<p>loop even more.</p>
<p>Um, I think for, you know, you asked about like if this can be relevant to educators,</p>
<p>like 100% online teaching is basically a form of live streaming now.</p>
<p>Um, and usually it happens through zoom.</p>
<p>I think if teachers view what they&rsquo;re doing as a kind of performance and a kind of live</p>
<p>stream performance, um, that would probably be pretty healthy because zoom can be kind</p>
<p>of awkward.</p>
<p>Um, and I brought up this little blog post actually just on like just what our setup</p>
<p>looked like if you want to adopt it yourself and how to integrate, um, like the broadcasting</p>
<p>software OBS with zoom or things like that.</p>
<p>It was really sorry to pause on that.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, maybe we could look at the blog post, but it looked really nice.</p>
<p>The thing is, I knew nothing about any of that stuff before I started.</p>
<p>I had a friend who knew a fair bit.</p>
<p>Um, and so he kind of helped show me the routes.</p>
<p>One of the things that I realized is that you could, as a teacher, like it doesn&rsquo;t take</p>
<p>that much to make things look and feel pretty professional.</p>
<p>Um, like one component of it is as soon as you hook things up with the broadcasting software,</p>
<p>rather than just doing like screen sharing, you can set up different scenes and then you</p>
<p>can like have keyboard shortcuts to transition between those scenes.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t need a production studio with a director calling like, go to camera three,</p>
<p>go to camera two, like onto the screen capture.</p>
<p>Instead you can have control of that.</p>
<p>And it took a little bit of practice and I would mess it up now and then, but I think</p>
<p>I had it decently smooth such that, you know, I&rsquo;m talking to the camera and then we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>something on the paper.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;re doing like a, um, playing with a Desmos graph or something.</p>
<p>And something that I think in the past would have required a production team, you can actually</p>
<p>do as a solo operation, um, and in particular as a teacher.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s worth it to try to do that because, uh, two reasons, one, you might get</p>
<p>more engagement from the students, but the biggest reason I think one of the like best</p>
<p>things that can come out of this pandemic education wise is if we turn a bunch of teachers</p>
<p>into content creators.</p>
<p>And if we take lessons that are usually done in these one off settings and like start to</p>
<p>get in the habit of, um, sometimes I&rsquo;ll use the phrase commoditizing explanation where</p>
<p>what you want is whatever a thing a student wants to learn.</p>
<p>It just seems inefficient to me that that lesson is taught millions of times over in</p>
<p>parallel across many different classrooms in the world.</p>
<p>Like year to year, you&rsquo;ve got a given algebra one lesson that&rsquo;s just taught like literally</p>
<p>millions of times, um, by different people.</p>
<p>What should happen is that there&rsquo;s the small handful of explanations online, uh, that exists</p>
<p>so that when someone needs that explanation, they can go to it, that the time in classroom</p>
<p>is spent on all of the parts of teaching and education that aren&rsquo;t explanation, which is</p>
<p>most of it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Um, and the way to get there is to basically have more people who are already explaining,</p>
<p>publish their explanations and have it in a publicized forum.</p>
<p>So if during a pandemic you can have people automatically creating online content cause</p>
<p>it has to be online, but getting into the habit of doing it in a, um, in a way that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t just feel like a zoom call that happened to be recorded, but it actually feels like</p>
<p>a, a piece that was always going to be publicized to more people than just your students that</p>
<p>can be really powerful.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an improvement process there, like so being self critical and growing, like,</p>
<p>you know, like I guess YouTubers go through this process of like putting out some content</p>
<p>and like nobody caring about it and then trying to figure out like, and basically improving</p>
<p>figure out like, why did nobody care?</p>
<p>What can I, you know, and they come up with all kinds of answers, which may or may not</p>
<p>be correct, but doesn&rsquo;t matter because the answer leads to improvement.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re being constantly self critical, self analytical, it should be better to say.</p>
<p>So you think of like, how can I make the audio better?</p>
<p>Like all the basic things.</p>
<p>Maybe one, one question to ask, cause, uh, well, by way of, uh, Russ Tedrick is a robotics</p>
<p>professor at MIT, one of my favorite people, a big fan of yours.</p>
<p>Uh, he watched our first conversation.</p>
<p>I just interviewed him a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>He, uh, he teaches this course in the under actuated robotics, which is, um, like robotic</p>
<p>systems when you can&rsquo;t control everything, like when you&rsquo;re like, we as humans, when</p>
<p>we walk, we&rsquo;re always falling forward, which means like it&rsquo;s gravity.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t control it.</p>
<p>You just hope you can catch yourself, but that&rsquo;s not all guaranteed.</p>
<p>It depends on the surface.</p>
<p>So like that&rsquo;s under actuated.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t control everything.</p>
<p>The number of actuators, uh, the degrees of freedoms you have is not enough to fully control</p>
<p>the system.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really, I think, beautiful, fascinating class.</p>
<p>He puts it online.</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s quite popular.</p>
<p>He does an incredible job teaching.</p>
<p>He puts it online every time, but he&rsquo;s kind of been interested in like crisping it up,</p>
<p>like, you know, making it, uh, you know, innovating in different kinds of ways.</p>
<p>And he was inspired by the work you do, because I think in his work, he can do similar kinds</p>
<p>of explanations as you&rsquo;re doing, like revealing the beauty of it and spending like months</p>
<p>in preparing a single video.</p>
<p>Uh, and he&rsquo;s interested in how to do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why he listened to the conversation.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s playing with manum, but he had this question of, you know, um, of, uh, you know, like in</p>
<p>my apartment where we did the interview, I have like curtains, like the, for like a black</p>
<p>curtain, not this, uh, this is, this is a adjacent mansion that we&rsquo;re in that I also,</p>
<p>uh, but you basically just have, I have like a black curtain, whatever that, you know,</p>
<p>makes it really easy to set up a filming situation with cameras that we have here, these microphones.</p>
<p>He was asking, you know, what kind of equipment do you recommend?</p>
<p>I guess like your blog post is a good one.</p>
<p>I said, I don&rsquo;t recommend this is excessive and actually really hard to work with.</p>
<p>So I wonder, I mean, uh, is there something you would recommend in terms of equipment?</p>
<p>Like is, is it, do you re do you think like lapel mics, like USB mics, what do you, for</p>
<p>my narration, I use a USB mic for the streams that used to lapel mic, uh, the narration,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a blue Yeti.</p>
<p>Um, I&rsquo;m forgetting actually the name of the lapel mic, but it was probably like a road</p>
<p>of some kind.</p>
<p>Um, but is it hard to figure out how to make the audio sound good?</p>
<p>Oh, I mean, listen to all the early videos on my channel and clearly like I&rsquo;m terrible</p>
<p>at this for, for some reason.</p>
<p>Um, I just couldn&rsquo;t get audio for awhile.</p>
<p>I think I, it&rsquo;s weird when you hear your own voice.</p>
<p>So you hear it, you&rsquo;re like, this sounds weird and it&rsquo;s hard to notice it sound weird because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not used to your own voice or they&rsquo;re like actual audio artifacts at play.</p>
<p>Um, so, uh, and then video is just for the lockdown, just the camera, like you said,</p>
<p>it was probably streaming somehow through the, yeah, there were two GH five cameras.</p>
<p>One that was mounted overhead over a piece of paper.</p>
<p>You could also use like an iPad or a Wacom tablet to do your writing electronically,</p>
<p>but I just wanted the paper feel, um, one on the face.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two.</p>
<p>Um, again, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m like just not actually the one to ask this cause I like</p>
<p>animate stuff usually, but, uh, each of them like has a compressor object that makes it</p>
<p>such that the camera output goes into the computer USB, but like gets compressed before</p>
<p>it does that.</p>
<p>The, the live aspect of it, do you, do you regret doing it live?</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>Um, I think I do think the content might be like much less sharp and tight than if it</p>
<p>were something, even that I just recorded like that and then edited later.</p>
<p>But I do like something that I do to be out there to show like, Hey, this is what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like.</p>
<p>Raw.</p>
<p>This is what it&rsquo;s like when I make mistakes.</p>
<p>Um, this is like the pace of thinking, um, I like the live interaction of it.</p>
<p>I think that made it better.</p>
<p>Uh, I probably would do it on a different channel.</p>
<p>I think, um, if I did series like that in the future, just because it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a different</p>
<p>style.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably a different target audience and, um, kind of keep clean what three blue</p>
<p>and brown is about versus, uh, the benefits of like live lectures.</p>
<p>Do you, uh, suggest like in this time of COVID that people like Russ or other educators tried</p>
<p>to go like the, the shorter, like 20 minute videos that are like really well planned out</p>
<p>or scripted.</p>
<p>You really think through, you slowly design.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not live.</p>
<p>Do you see like that being an important part of, um, what they do?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, what I think teachers like Russ should do is, um, choose the small handful of topics</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to do just really well.</p>
<p>They want to create the best short explanation of it in the world that will be one of those</p>
<p>handfuls in a world where you have commoditized explanation, right?</p>
<p>Most of the lectures should be done just normally.</p>
<p>Um, so put thought and planning into it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s a wonderful teacher and like knows all about that, but maybe choose those</p>
<p>small handful of topics.</p>
<p>Um, do what beneficial for me sometimes is I do sample lessons with people on that topic</p>
<p>to get some sense of how other people think about it.</p>
<p>Let that inform how you want to, um, edit it or script it or whatever format you want</p>
<p>to do.</p>
<p>Some people are comfortable just explaining it and editing later.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more comfortable like writing it out and thinking in that setting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of sad.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>Uh, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a little bit sad to me to see how much knowledge is lost.</p>
<p>Like just, just like you mentioned, there&rsquo;s professors, like we can take my dad, for example,</p>
<p>to blow up his ego a little bit, but he&rsquo;s a, he&rsquo;s a great teacher and he knows plasma,</p>
<p>plasma chemistry, plasma physics really well.</p>
<p>So he can very simply explain some beautiful, but otherwise, uh, complicated concepts.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sad that like, if you Google plasma or like for plasma physics, like there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>videos.</p>
<p>And just imagine if every one of those excellent teachers like your father or like Russ, um,</p>
<p>even if they just chose one topic this year, they&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m going to make the best video</p>
<p>that I can on this topic.</p>
<p>If every one of the great teachers did that, the internet would be replete and it&rsquo;s already</p>
<p>replete with great explanations.</p>
<p>But it would be even more so with all the niche, great explanations and like anything</p>
<p>you want to learn.</p>
<p>Um, and there&rsquo;s a self interest to it for, in terms of teachers, in terms of even, so</p>
<p>if you take Russ, for example, it&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;s teaching something like he teaches his</p>
<p>main thing, his thing he&rsquo;s deeply passionate about.</p>
<p>And from a selfish perspective, it&rsquo;s also just like, I mean, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>publishing a paper in a really, uh, like nature has like letters, like accessible publication.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just going to guarantee that your work, that your passion is seen by a huge number</p>
<p>of people, whatever the definition of huge is, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much more than it otherwise, uh, would be.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s those lectures that tell early students what to be interested in at the moment.</p>
<p>I think students are disproportionately interested in the things that are well represented on</p>
<p>YouTube.</p>
<p>So to any educator out there, if you&rsquo;re wondering, Hey, I want more like grad students in my</p>
<p>department, like what&rsquo;s the best way to recruit grad students?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, make the best video you can and then wait eight years.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re going to have a pile of like excellent grad students for that department.</p>
<p>And one of the lessons I think your channel teaches is there&rsquo;s appeal of explaining just</p>
<p>something beautiful, explaining it cleanly, technically not doing a marketing video about</p>
<p>why topology is great.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s yeah, that&rsquo;s the, there&rsquo;s people interested in this stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, uh, one of the greatest channels like Matt, it&rsquo;s not even a math channel, but the</p>
<p>channel with greatest math content is Vsauce, like interviewed.</p>
<p>If imagine you were to propose making a video that explains the Banach Tarski paradox substantively,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Like not shying around it, maybe not describing things in terms of, um, like the group theoretic</p>
<p>terminology that you&rsquo;d usually see in a paper, but the actual results, um, that went into</p>
<p>this idea of like breaking apart a sphere, proposing that to like a network TV station</p>
<p>saying, yeah, I&rsquo;m going to, I&rsquo;m going to do this in depth talk of the Banach Tarski paradox.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s going to reach 20 million people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, get out of here.</p>
<p>Like no, no one cares about that.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s interested in anything even anywhere near that.</p>
<p>But then you have Michael&rsquo;s quirky personality around it.</p>
<p>And just people that are actually hungry for that kind of depth, um, then you don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>like the approval of some higher network.</p>
<p>You can just do it and let the people speak for themselves.</p>
<p>So I think, you know, if your father was to make something on plasma physics or, um, if</p>
<p>we were to have like, uh, underactualized robotics, underactuated, underactuated, yes,</p>
<p>not underactualized, plenty actualized underactuated robotics.</p>
<p>Robotics is under actualized currently.</p>
<p>So even if it&rsquo;s things that you might think are niche, I bet you&rsquo;ll be surprised by how</p>
<p>many people, um, actually engage with it really deeply.</p>
<p>Although I just psychologically watching him, I can&rsquo;t speak for a lot of people.</p>
<p>I can speak for my dad.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a little bit of a skill gap, but I think that could be overcome.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty basic.</p>
<p>None of us know how to make videos when we start the first stuff I made was terrible</p>
<p>in a number of respects.</p>
<p>Like look at the earliest videos I need in the YouTube channel, except for captain disillusion.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all like terrible versions of whatever they are now.</p>
<p>But the thing I&rsquo;ve noticed, especially like with world experts is it&rsquo;s the same thing</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m sure you went through, which is like, um, fear of like embarrassment.</p>
<p>Like they, they definitely, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the same reason.</p>
<p>Like I feel that anytime I put out a video, I don&rsquo;t know if you still feel that.</p>
<p>But like, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s this imposter syndrome.</p>
<p>Like who am I to talk about this?</p>
<p>And that that&rsquo;s true for like even things that you&rsquo;ve studied for like your whole life.</p>
<p>Uh, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s scary to post stuff on YouTube.</p>
<p>It is scary.</p>
<p>Uh, I honestly wish that more of the people who had that modesty to say, who am I to</p>
<p>post this?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the ones actually posting it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I mean, the honest problem is like a lot of the educational content is posted by people</p>
<p>who like, we&rsquo;re just starting to research it two weeks ago and are on a certain schedule</p>
<p>and who maybe should think like, who am I to explain and choose your favorite topic,</p>
<p>quantum mechanics or something.</p>
<p>Um, and the people who have the self awareness, uh, to not post are probably the people also</p>
<p>best positioned to give a good, honest explanation of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s a lot of value in a channel like numberphile where they basically trap</p>
<p>a really smart person and force them to explain stuff on a bronze sheet of paper.</p>
<p>So, but of course that&rsquo;s not scalable as a single channel.</p>
<p>If they, if there&rsquo;s anything beautiful that it could be done as people take it in their</p>
<p>own hands, uh, educators, which is again, circling back, I do think the pandemic will</p>
<p>serve to force a lot of people&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be making online content anyway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happening, right?</p>
<p>Just hit that publish button and see how it goes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>See how it goes.</p>
<p>The cool thing about YouTube is it might not go for a while, but like 10 years later, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be like, this, the thing this, what people don&rsquo;t understand with YouTube, at least</p>
<p>for now, at least that&rsquo;s my hope with it is, uh, it&rsquo;s a leg.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s literally better than publishing a book in terms of the legacy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it will live for a long, long time.</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s, um, one of the things I mentioned Joe Rogan before, it&rsquo;s kinda, there&rsquo;s a sad</p>
<p>thing cause I&rsquo;m a fan.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s moving to Spotify.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Nine digit numbers will do that to you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But he doesn&rsquo;t really that he was one of the person that doesn&rsquo;t actually care that much</p>
<p>about money.</p>
<p>Like having talked to him here, it wasn&rsquo;t because of money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because he legitimately thinks that they&rsquo;re going to do like a better job.</p>
<p>Like, so they&rsquo;re, so from his perspective, YouTube, you have to understand where they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>coming from.</p>
<p>YouTube has been cracking down on people who they, you know, Joe Rogan talks to Alex Jones</p>
<p>and conspiracy theories and stuff.</p>
<p>And YouTube is really like careful that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not a good feeling.</p>
<p>Like, and Joe didn&rsquo;t, doesn&rsquo;t feel like YouTube was on his side.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s often has videos that they don&rsquo;t put in trending that like are obviously</p>
<p>should be in trending because they&rsquo;re nervous about like, you know, if this concert is this,</p>
<p>is this content going to, you know, upset people that all that kind of stuff have misinformation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not a good place for a person to be in.</p>
<p>And Spotify is giving them a, we&rsquo;re never going to censor you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re never going to do that.</p>
<p>But the reason I bring that up, whatever you think about that, I personally think as bullshit</p>
<p>because podcasting should be free and not constrained to a platform.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pirate radio.</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, as much as I love Spotify, you can&rsquo;t just, you can&rsquo;t put fences around it.</p>
<p>But anyway, the reason I bring that up is Joe&rsquo;s going to remove his entire library from</p>
<p>YouTube.</p>
<p>Whoa, really?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>His full length, the clips are going to stay, but the full length videos are all, I mean,</p>
<p>made private or deleted.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of the deal.</p>
<p>And like, that&rsquo;s the first time where I was like, Oh, YouTube videos might not live forever.</p>
<p>Like things you find like, okay, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>This is why you need an IPFS or something where it&rsquo;s like, if there&rsquo;s a content link,</p>
<p>are you familiar with this system at all?</p>
<p>Like right now, if you have a URL, it points to a server.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a system where the address points to content and then it&rsquo;s like distributed.</p>
<p>So you, you can&rsquo;t actually delete what&rsquo;s at an address because it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s content addressed.</p>
<p>And as long as there&rsquo;s someone on the network who hosts it, it&rsquo;s always accessible at the</p>
<p>address that it once was.</p>
<p>But I mean, that raises a question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to put you on the spot, but like somebody like Vsauce, right?</p>
<p>Spotify comes along and gives him, let&rsquo;s say $100 billion.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say some crazy number and then removes it from YouTube, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made me, I don&rsquo;t know, for some reason I thought YouTube is forever.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it will be.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, another variant that this might take is like, uh, that, you know, um,</p>
<p>you fast forward 50 years and, uh, you know, Google or Alphabet isn&rsquo;t the company that</p>
<p>it once was.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of struggling to make ends meet.</p>
<p>And you know, it&rsquo;s been supplanted by the whoever wins on the AR game or whatever it</p>
<p>might be.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re like, you know, all of these videos that we&rsquo;re hosting are pretty costly.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re just, we&rsquo;re going to start deleting the ones that aren&rsquo;t watched that much and</p>
<p>tell people to like try to back them up on their own or whatever it is.</p>
<p>Um, or even if it does exist in some form forever, it&rsquo;s like if people are, um, not</p>
<p>habituated to watching YouTube in 50 years, they&rsquo;re watching something else, which seems</p>
<p>pretty likely.</p>
<p>Like it would be shocking if YouTube remained as popular as it is now indefinitely into</p>
<p>the future.</p>
<p>So, uh, it won&rsquo;t be forever.</p>
<p>Makes me sad still, but cause it&rsquo;s such a nice, it&rsquo;s just like you said of the canonical</p>
<p>videos.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t mean to interrupt.</p>
<p>You know, you should get Juan Bennett on the, uh, on the thing and then talk to him about</p>
<p>permanence.</p>
<p>I think you would have a good conversation.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s the one that founded this thing called IPFS that I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>And if you have him talk about basically what you&rsquo;re describing, like, Oh, it&rsquo;s sad that</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t forever.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;ll get some articulate pontification around it that&rsquo;s like been pretty well thought</p>
<p>through.</p>
<p>Uh, but yeah, I do see YouTube, just like you said, as a, as a place, like what your</p>
<p>channel creates, which is like a set of canonical videos on a topic.</p>
<p>Now others could create videos on that topic as well, but as a collection, it creates a</p>
<p>nice set of places to go.</p>
<p>Uh, if you&rsquo;re curious about a particular topic and it seems like coronavirus is a nice opportunity</p>
<p>to, uh, put that knowledge out there in the world at, uh, MIT and beyond, I have to talk</p>
<p>to you a little bit about machine learning, deep learning and so on.</p>
<p>Again, we talked about last time you have a set of beautiful videos on neural networks.</p>
<p>Uh, let me ask you first, what is the most beautiful aspect of neural networks and machine</p>
<p>learning to you, like for making those videos from watching how the field is evolving?</p>
<p>Is there something mathematically or in applied sense, just beautiful to you about them?</p>
<p>Well, I think what I would go to is the layered structure and how, um, you can have what feel</p>
<p>like qualitatively distinct things happening, going from one layer to another, but that</p>
<p>are, um, following the same mathematical rule because you look at it as a piece of math.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you got a non linearity and then you&rsquo;ve got a matrix multiplication.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening on all the layers.</p>
<p>Um, but especially if you look at like some of the visualizations that, uh, like Chris</p>
<p>Ola has done with respect to, um, like convolutional nets that have been trained on image net trying</p>
<p>to say, what does this neuron do?</p>
<p>What do this, uh, does this family of neurons do?</p>
<p>What you can see is that, um, the ones closer to the input side are picking up on very low</p>
<p>level ideas like the texture, right?</p>
<p>And then as you get further back, you have higher level ideas.</p>
<p>Like what is the, where are the eyes in this picture?</p>
<p>And then how do the eyes form like an animal is this animal, a cat or a dog or a deer.</p>
<p>You have this series of qualitatively different things happening, even though it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>piece of math on each one.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a pretty beautiful idea that you can have like a generalizable object that,</p>
<p>um, runs through the layers of abstraction, which in some sense constitute intelligence</p>
<p>is having, um, those many different layers of an understanding to something form abstractions</p>
<p>in a automated way.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s automated abstracting, which, I mean, that just feels very powerful.</p>
<p>Um, and the idea that it can be so simply mathematically represented.</p>
<p>I mean, a ton of like modern ML research seems a little bit like you do a bunch of ad hoc</p>
<p>things, then you decide which one worked and then you retrospectively come up with the</p>
<p>mathematical reason that it always had to work.</p>
<p>Um, but you know, who cares how you came to it when you have like that elegant piece of</p>
<p>math?</p>
<p>Uh, it&rsquo;s hard not to just smile seeing it work in action.</p>
<p>Well, and when you talked about topology before, one of the really interesting things is, is</p>
<p>beginning to be investigated under kind of the field of like science and deep learning,</p>
<p>which is like the craziness of the surface that, uh, is trying to be optimized, uh, in</p>
<p>neural networks.</p>
<p>I mean, the, the amount of local minima, local optima there is in these surfaces and somehow</p>
<p>a dumb gradient descent algorithm was able to find really good solutions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s really surprising.</p>
<p>Well, so on the one hand it is, but also it&rsquo;s like not, it&rsquo;s not terribly surprising that</p>
<p>you have these interesting points that exist when you make your space so high dimensional,</p>
<p>like GPT three, what did it have?</p>
<p>175 billion parameters.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t feel as mesmerizing to think about, Oh, there&rsquo;s some surface of intelligent</p>
<p>behavior in this crazy high dimensional space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s so many parameters that of course, but what&rsquo;s more interesting is</p>
<p>like, how, how is it that you&rsquo;re able to efficiently get there, which is maybe what you&rsquo;re describing</p>
<p>that something as dumb as gradient descent does it, but like the re the reason that gradient</p>
<p>descent works well with neural networks and not just, you know, choose however you want</p>
<p>to parameterize this space and then like apply gradient descent to it is that that layered</p>
<p>structure lets you decompose the derivative in a way that makes it computationally feasible.</p>
<p>Um, yeah, it&rsquo;s just that, that there&rsquo;s so many good solutions, probably infinitely infinitely</p>
<p>many good solutions, not best solutions, but good solutions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s similar to, uh, Steven Wolfram has this idea of like the, if you just look at all</p>
<p>space of computations of all space of basically algorithms that you&rsquo;d be surprised how many</p>
<p>of them are actually intelligent.</p>
<p>Like if you just randomly pick from the bucket, uh, that&rsquo;s surprising.</p>
<p>We tend to think like a tiny, tiny minority of them would be intelligent, but his sense</p>
<p>is like, it seems weirdly easy to find computations that do something interesting.</p>
<p>Well, okay, so that from like a calm agor, calm agor of complexity standpoint, almost</p>
<p>everything will be interesting.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s fascinating is to find the stuff that&rsquo;s describable with low information, but still</p>
<p>does interesting things.</p>
<p>Uh, like one fun example of this, you know, um, Shannon&rsquo;s noisy coding and theorem, uh,</p>
<p>noisy coding theorem and, uh, information theory that basically says if, you know, I</p>
<p>want to send some bits to you, um, maybe, uh, some of them are going to get flipped.</p>
<p>Uh, there&rsquo;s some noise along the channel.</p>
<p>I can come up with some way of coding it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s resilient to that noise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very good.</p>
<p>Um, and then he quantitatively describes what very good is.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s funny about how he proves the existence of good error correction codes is rather than</p>
<p>saying like, here&rsquo;s how to construct it or even like a sensible nonconstructive proof.</p>
<p>The nature of his nonconstructive proof is to say, um, if we chose a random encoding,</p>
<p>it would be almost at the limit, which is weird because then it took decades for people</p>
<p>to actually find any that were anywhere close to the limit.</p>
<p>And what his proof was saying is choose a random one.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like the best kind of encoding you&rsquo;ll ever find.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s what that tells us is that sometimes when you choose a random element from this</p>
<p>ungodly huge set, that&rsquo;s a very different task from finding an efficient way to actively</p>
<p>describe it.</p>
<p>Cause in that case, the random element to actually implement it as a bit of code, you</p>
<p>would just have this huge table of like, um, telling you how to encode one thing into another.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s totally computationally infeasible.</p>
<p>So on the side of like how many possible programs are interesting in some way, it&rsquo;s like, yeah,</p>
<p>tons of them.</p>
<p>But the much, much more delicate question is when you can have a low information description</p>
<p>of something that still becomes interesting.</p>
<p>And thereby this kind of gives you a blueprint for how to engineer that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Chaos theory is another good instance there where it&rsquo;s like, yeah, a ton of things are</p>
<p>hard to describe, but how do you have ones that have a simple set of governing equations</p>
<p>that remain like arbitrarily hard to describe?</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you, uh, you mentioned GPT three.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to ask, uh, what are your thoughts about the recently released open</p>
<p>AI GPT three model that I believe is already trying to learn how to communicate like Grant</p>
<p>Sanderson?</p>
<p>You know, I think I got an email a day or two ago about someone who wanted to, um, try</p>
<p>to use GPT three with manum where you would like give it a high level description of something</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;ll like automatically create the mathematical animation, like trying to put</p>
<p>me out of a job here.</p>
<p>I mean, it probably won&rsquo;t put you out of a job, but it&rsquo;ll create something visually beautiful</p>
<p>for sure.</p>
<p>I would be surprised if that worked as stated, but maybe there&rsquo;s like variants of it like</p>
<p>that you can get to.</p>
<p>Um, I mean like a lot of those demos, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I think, uh, there&rsquo;s a lot of failed experiments, like depending on how you prime the thing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have a lot of failed, I&rsquo;m certainly with code and program synthesis.</p>
<p>Most of it won&rsquo;t even run, but eventually I think if you, if you&rsquo;re, if you pick the</p>
<p>right examples, you&rsquo;ll be able to generate something cool.</p>
<p>And I think that even that&rsquo;s good enough, even though if it&rsquo;s, if it&rsquo;s, if you&rsquo;re being</p>
<p>very selective, it&rsquo;s still cool that something can be generated.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a huge value.</p>
<p>Um, I mean, think of the writing process.</p>
<p>Sometimes a big part of it is just getting a bunch of stuff on the page and then you</p>
<p>can decide what to whittle down to.</p>
<p>So if it can be used in like a man machine symbiosis where it&rsquo;s just giving you a spew</p>
<p>of potential ideas that then you can refine down, um, like it&rsquo;s serving as the generator</p>
<p>and then the human serves as the refiner.</p>
<p>That seems like a pretty powerful dynamic.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Have you, uh, have you gotten a chance to see any of the demos like on Twitter?</p>
<p>Is there a favorite you&rsquo;ve seen or?</p>
<p>Oh, my absolute favorite.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, so Tim Blay who runs a channel called acapella science, he was like tweeting a bunch</p>
<p>about playing with it.</p>
<p>Um, and so he, so GPT three was trained on the internet from before COVID.</p>
<p>So in a sense it doesn&rsquo;t know about the Corona virus.</p>
<p>So what he seeded it with was just a short description about like, um, a novel virus,</p>
<p>uh, emerges in Wuhan, China and starts to spread around the globe.</p>
<p>What follows is a month by month description of what happens, January, colon, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he sees it with.</p>
<p>So then what GPT three generates is like January, then a paragraph of description, February</p>
<p>and such.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the funniest thing you&rsquo;ll ever read because, um, it predicts a zombie apocalypse,</p>
<p>which of course it would because it&rsquo;s trained on like the internet, the stories, but what</p>
<p>you see unfolding is a description of COVID 19 if it were a zombie apocalypse.</p>
<p>And like the early aspects of it are kind of shockingly in line with what&rsquo;s reasonable</p>
<p>and then it gets out of hand so quickly.</p>
<p>And the other flip side of that is, uh, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it&rsquo;s onto something</p>
<p>at some point here when, you know, 2020 has been full of surprises, who knows, like we</p>
<p>might all be in like this crazy militarized zone as it predicts just a couple of months</p>
<p>off.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s definitely an interesting tool of storytelling.</p>
<p>It has struggled with mathematics, which is interesting, or in just even numbers, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>able to, it&rsquo;s not able to generate like patterns, you know, like you give it, um, in like five</p>
<p>digit numbers and it&rsquo;s not able to figure out the sequence, you know, or like, um, I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t look in too much, but I&rsquo;m talking about like sequences, like the Fibonacci numbers</p>
<p>and to see how far it can go because obviously it&rsquo;s leveraging stuff from the internet and</p>
<p>it starts to lose it, but it is also cool that I&rsquo;ve seen it able to generate some interesting</p>
<p>patterns, um, that are mathematically correct.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I honestly haven&rsquo;t dug into like what&rsquo;s going on within it, uh, in a way that I can speak</p>
<p>intelligently to, I guess it doesn&rsquo;t surprise me that it&rsquo;s bad at numerical patterns because</p>
<p>I mean, maybe I should be more impressed with it, but like that requires having, um, a weird</p>
<p>combination of intuitive and, uh, and formulaic worldview.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not just going off of intuition.</p>
<p>When you see Fibonacci numbers, you&rsquo;re not saying like intuitively, what do I think will</p>
<p>follow the 13?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve seen patterns a lot where like 13s are followed by 21s instead.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, like the way you&rsquo;re starting to see a shape of things is by knowing what hypotheses</p>
<p>to test where you&rsquo;re saying, oh, maybe it&rsquo;s generated based on the previous terms or maybe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s generated based on like multiplying by a constant or whatever it is you like have</p>
<p>a bunch of different hypotheses and your intuitions are around those hypotheses, but you still</p>
<p>need to actively test it.</p>
<p>Um, and it seems like GPT three is extremely good at, um, like that sort of pattern matching</p>
<p>recognition that usually is very hard for computers.</p>
<p>That is what humans get good at through expertise and exposure to lots of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s good to learn from as many examples as you can rather than just from the definitions</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s to get that level of intuition, but to actually concretize it into a piece of math,</p>
<p>you do need to, um, like test your hypotheses and if not prove it, um, like have an actual</p>
<p>explanation for what&rsquo;s going on, not just a, uh, a pattern that you&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, but then the flip side to play devil&rsquo;s advocate, that&rsquo;s a very kind of probably correct</p>
<p>intuitive understanding of just like we said, a few, a few layers creating abstractions,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s been able to form something that looks like, uh, a compression of the data</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s seen that looks awfully a lot like it understands what the heck it&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>about.</p>
<p>Well, I think a lot of understanding is like, I don&rsquo;t mean to denigrate pattern recognition.</p>
<p>Pattern recognition is most of understanding and it&rsquo;s super important and it&rsquo;s super hard.</p>
<p>Um, and so like when it&rsquo;s demonstrating this kind of real understanding, compressing down</p>
<p>some data, like that, that might be pattern recognition at its finest.</p>
<p>My only point would be that like what differentiates math, I think to a large extent is that, um,</p>
<p>the pattern recognition isn&rsquo;t sufficient and that the kind of patterns that you&rsquo;re recognizing</p>
<p>are not like the end goals, but instead they&rsquo;re, they are the little bits and paths that get</p>
<p>you to the end goal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly true for mathematics in general.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting question if that might, uh, for certain kinds of series of numbers,</p>
<p>it might not be true.</p>
<p>Like you might, um, because that&rsquo;s a basic, you know, like Taylor&rsquo;s like certain kinds</p>
<p>of series, it feels like compressing the internet, uh, is, is enough to figure out because those</p>
<p>patterns in some form appear in the text somewhere.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, there&rsquo;s, uh, there&rsquo;s all sorts of wonderful examples of false patterns in</p>
<p>math where, um, one of the earliest videos I put on the channel was talking about the</p>
<p>extent of dividing a circle up using these chords.</p>
<p>And you see this pattern of one, two, four, eight, 16, I was like, okay, pretty easy to</p>
<p>see what that pattern is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s powers of two.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen it a million times.</p>
<p>Um, but it&rsquo;s not powers of two.</p>
<p>The next term is 31.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like almost a power of two, but it&rsquo;s a little bit shy.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s actually a very good explanation for what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Um, but I think it&rsquo;s a good test of whether you&rsquo;re thinking clearly about mechanistic</p>
<p>explanations of things, how quickly you jump to thinking it must be powers of two because</p>
<p>the problem itself, there&rsquo;s really no, no good way to, I mean, there can&rsquo;t be a good</p>
<p>way to think about it as like doubling a set because ultimately it doesn&rsquo;t, but even before</p>
<p>it starts to, it&rsquo;s not something that screams out as being a doubling phenomenon.</p>
<p>So at best, if it did turn out to be powers of two, it would have only been so very subtly.</p>
<p>And I think the difference between like, you know, a math student making the mistake and</p>
<p>a mathematician who&rsquo;s experienced seeing that kind of pattern is that they, they&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>a sense from what the problem itself is, whether the pattern that they&rsquo;re observing is reasonable</p>
<p>and how to test it.</p>
<p>And like, uh, I w I would just be very impressed if there was any algorithm that, um, was actively</p>
<p>accomplishing that goal.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like a learning base algorithm.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like a little scientist, I guess.</p>
<p>Basically.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fascinating thought because GPT three, these language models are already accomplishing</p>
<p>way more than I&rsquo;ve expected.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m learning not to doubt, but we&rsquo;ll get there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I, I, I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;d be impressed, but like surprised, like I&rsquo;ll be impressed, but</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll get there on, um, algorithms doing math like that.</p>
<p>So one of the amazing things you&rsquo;ve done for the world is to some degree, open sourcing</p>
<p>the tooling that you use to make your videos with Madam, uh, this Python library.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s quickly evolving because I think you&rsquo;re inventing new things every time you</p>
<p>make a video.</p>
<p>In fact, I wanted, um, I&rsquo;ve been working on playing around with something.</p>
<p>I wanted to do like an ode to three blue on Brown.</p>
<p>Like I love playing Hendrix.</p>
<p>I wanted to do like a cover, you know, of a concept I wanted to visualize and use Madam.</p>
<p>And I saw that you had like a little piece of code on like Mobia strip and I tried to</p>
<p>do some cool things with spinning a Mobia strip, like continue, um, twisting it, I guess</p>
<p>is the term, uh, and it was easier to, uh, it was tough.</p>
<p>So I haven&rsquo;t figured it out yet.</p>
<p>Well, so I guess the question I want to ask is so many people love it, uh, that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>put that out there.</p>
<p>They want to, uh, do the same thing as I do with Hendrix and want to cover it.</p>
<p>They want to explain an idea using the tool, including Russ.</p>
<p>How would you recommend they try to, I&rsquo;m very sorry.</p>
<p>They try to go, they try to go by, uh, about it and what kind of choices should they choose</p>
<p>to be most effective?</p>
<p>That I can answer.</p>
<p>So I always feel guilty if this comes up because, um, I think of it like this scrappy tool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a math teacher who put together some code.</p>
<p>People asked what it was, so they made it open source and they kept scrapping it together.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot, like a lot of things about it that make it harder to work with than it</p>
<p>needs to be that are a function of like me not being a software engineer.</p>
<p>Um, I, I&rsquo;ve, I&rsquo;ve put some work this year trying to like make it better and more flexible.</p>
<p>Um, that is still just kind of like a work in process.</p>
<p>Um, one thing I would love to do is just get my act together about properly integrating</p>
<p>with what like the community wants to work with and like what stuff I work on and making</p>
<p>that, um, not like deviate, uh, and just like actually fostering that community in a way</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve, I&rsquo;ve been like shamefully neglectful of.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just always guilty if it comes up.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s put that guilt aside, just kind of Zen, like I&rsquo;ll pretend like it isn&rsquo;t terrible</p>
<p>for someone like Russ.</p>
<p>Um, I think step one is like, make sure that what you&rsquo;re animating should be done so programmatically</p>
<p>because a lot of things maybe shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Um, like if you&rsquo;re just making a quick graph of something, uh, if it&rsquo;s a graphical intuition</p>
<p>that maybe has a little motion to it, use Desmos, use grapher, use GeoGebra, use Mathematica,</p>
<p>certain things that are like really oriented around graph.</p>
<p>GeoGebra is kind of cool.</p>
<p>I did super amazing.</p>
<p>You can get very, very far with it.</p>
<p>Um, and in a lot of ways, like it would make more sense for STEM stuff that I do to just</p>
<p>do in GeoGebra, but I kind of have this cycle of liking to try to improve man and by doing</p>
<p>videos and such.</p>
<p>So, uh, do as I say, not as I do.</p>
<p>The original like thought I had in making manum was that there&rsquo;s so many different ways</p>
<p>of representing functions other than graphs, um, in particular things like transformations,</p>
<p>like use movement over time to communicate relationships between inputs and outputs instead</p>
<p>of like estimate direction and Y direction, um, or like vector fields or things like that.</p>
<p>So I wanted something that was flexible enough that you didn&rsquo;t feel constrained into a graphical</p>
<p>environment.</p>
<p>Um, by graphical, I mean like graphs with like X coordinate, Y coordinate kind of stuff,</p>
<p>but also make sure that, um, you&rsquo;re taking advantage of the fact that it&rsquo;s programmatic.</p>
<p>You have loops, you have conditionals, you have abstraction.</p>
<p>If any of those are like well fit for what you want to teach to, you know, have a scene</p>
<p>type that you tweak a little bit based on parameters or to have conditional so that</p>
<p>things can go one way or another or loops so that you can create these things of like</p>
<p>arbitrarily increasing complexity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the stuff that&rsquo;s like meant to be animated programmatically.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s just like writing some text on the screen or shifting around objects or something</p>
<p>like that, um, things like that, you should probably just use keynote, right?</p>
<p>Um, you&rsquo;d be a lot simpler.</p>
<p>So, uh, try to find a workflow that distills down that which should be programmatic into</p>
<p>manum and that which doesn&rsquo;t need to be into like other domains.</p>
<p>Again, do as I say, not as I do.</p>
<p>I mean, Python is an integral part of it.</p>
<p>Just for the fun of it, let me ask, uh, what, uh, what&rsquo;s your most and least favorite aspects</p>
<p>of Python?</p>
<p>Ooh, most and least.</p>
<p>I mean, I love that it&rsquo;s like object oriented and functional, I guess that you can kind</p>
<p>of like get both of those, um, uh, benefits for how you structure things.</p>
<p>So if you would just want to quickly whip something together, the functional aspects</p>
<p>are nice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your primary language, like for programmatically generating stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s home for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sometimes you travel, but it&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>Uh, I mean, the biggest disadvantage is that it&rsquo;s slow.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re doing computationally intensive things, either you have to like think about</p>
<p>it more than you should how to make it efficient or it just like takes long.</p>
<p>Do you run into that at all?</p>
<p>Like with your work?</p>
<p>Well, so, uh, certainly old man is like way slower than it needs to be because of, uh,</p>
<p>how it renders things on the backend is like kind of absurd.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve rewritten things such that it&rsquo;s all done with like shaders in such a way that it should</p>
<p>be just like live and actually like interactive while you&rsquo;re coding it.</p>
<p>If you want to, to have like a 3d scene, you can move around, you can, um, have, um, elements</p>
<p>respond to where your mouse is or things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not something that user of a video is going to get to experience cause there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a play button and a pause button.</p>
<p>But while you&rsquo;re developing, that can be nice.</p>
<p>Um, so it&rsquo;s gotten better in speed in that sense, but that&rsquo;s basically because the hard</p>
<p>work is being done in the language that&rsquo;s not Python, but GLSL, right?</p>
<p>Um, but yeah, there are some times when it&rsquo;s like a, um, there&rsquo;s just a lot of data that</p>
<p>goes into the object that I want to animate that then it just like Python is slow.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask, quickly ask, what do you think about the walrus operator, if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>familiar with it at all?</p>
<p>The reason it&rsquo;s interesting, there&rsquo;s a new operator in Python 3.8.</p>
<p>I find it psychologically interesting cause it, the toxicity over it led Guido to resign</p>
<p>the step down from this.</p>
<p>Is that actually true?</p>
<p>Or was it like, there&rsquo;s a bunch of surrounding things that also, was it actually the walrus</p>
<p>operator that, that.</p>
<p>Well, it was, it was a text, it was an accumulation of toxicity, but that was the, the most, that</p>
<p>was the most toxic one, like the discussion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most number of Python core developers that were opposed to Guido&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>Um, he didn&rsquo;t particularly, I don&rsquo;t think cared about it either way.</p>
<p>He just thought it was a good idea.</p>
<p>This is where you approve it.</p>
<p>And like the structure of the idea of a BDFL is like you listen to everybody, hear everybody</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>You make a decision and you move forward.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t like the negativity that burdened him after that.</p>
<p>People like some parts of the benevolent dictator for life mantra, but once the dictator does</p>
<p>things different than you want, suddenly dictatorship doesn&rsquo;t seem so great.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, they still liked it.</p>
<p>He just couldn&rsquo;t because he truly is the bee in the benevolent.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s really, he really is a nice guy.</p>
<p>He, I mean, and I think he can&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s a lot of toxicity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a difficult job.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why Linus Torvalds is perhaps the way he is.</p>
<p>You have to have a thick skin to fight off, fight off the warring masses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of surprising to me how many people can like threatened to murder each other over</p>
<p>whether we should have braces or not, or like it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s my knee jerk reaction to the walrus operators.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t actually care that much either way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to get personally passionate.</p>
<p>My initial reaction was like, yeah, this seems to make things more confusing to read.</p>
<p>But then again, so does list comprehension until you&rsquo;re used to it.</p>
<p>So like if there&rsquo;s a use for it, great, if not great, but like, let&rsquo;s just all calm down</p>
<p>about our spaces versus tabs debates here and like, be chill.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To me, it just represents the value of great leadership, even in open source communities.</p>
<p>Does it represent that if he stepped down as a leader?</p>
<p>Well, he fought for it.</p>
<p>No, he got it passed.</p>
<p>I guess, but I guess, I could represent multiple things too.</p>
<p>It can represent like failed dictatorships or it can, it can represent a lot of things,</p>
<p>but to me, great leaders take risks.</p>
<p>Even if it, even if it&rsquo;s a mistake at the end, like you have to make decisions.</p>
<p>The thing is this world won&rsquo;t go anywhere.</p>
<p>If you constantly, if whenever there&rsquo;s a divisive thing, you wait until the division is no longer</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the paralysis we experienced with like Congress and political systems.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to be slow when there&rsquo;s indecision, when there&rsquo;s people disagree, it&rsquo;s good to</p>
<p>take your time.</p>
<p>But like at a certain point it results in paralysis and you just have to make a decision.</p>
<p>The background of the site, whether it&rsquo;s yellow, blue, or red can cause people to like go to</p>
<p>war over each other, which I&rsquo;ve seen this with design.</p>
<p>People are very touch on color, color choices at the end of the day, just make a decision</p>
<p>and go with it.</p>
<p>And that, that&rsquo;s what the Walrus operator represents to me is it represents the fighter</p>
<p>pilot instinct of like quick action is more important than, than just like hearing everybody</p>
<p>out and really think it through it because that&rsquo;s going to lead to paralysis.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like if that&rsquo;s the actual case that, you know, it&rsquo;s something where he&rsquo;s consciously hearing</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s disagreement, disagreeing with that disagreement and saying he wants to move forward</p>
<p>anyway, that&rsquo;s an admirable aspect of leadership.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t have much time, but I want to ask just cause it&rsquo;s some beautiful mathematics</p>
<p>involved.</p>
<p>2020 brought us a couple of in the physics world theories of everything, Eric Weinstein</p>
<p>kind of, I mean, it&rsquo;s been working for probably decades, but he put out this idea of geometric</p>
<p>unity or started sort of publicly thinking and talking about it more, Steven Wolfram</p>
<p>put out his physics project, which is kind of this hypergraph view of a theory of everything.</p>
<p>Do you find interesting, beautiful things to these theories of everything?</p>
<p>What do you think about the physics world and sort of the beautiful, interesting, insightful</p>
<p>mathematics in that world, whether we&rsquo;re talking about quantum mechanics, which you touched</p>
<p>on in a bunch of your videos a little bit, quaternions, like just the mathematics involved</p>
<p>or the general relativity, which is more about surfaces and topology, all that stuff.</p>
<p>Well, I think, um, as far as like popularized science is concerned, people are more interested</p>
<p>in theories of everything than they should be like, cause the problem is whether we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about trying to make sense of Weinstein&rsquo;s lectures or Wolfram&rsquo;s project, or let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>say like listening to, uh, Witten talk about string theory, whatever proposed path to a</p>
<p>theory of everything, um, you&rsquo;re not actually going to understand it.</p>
<p>Some physicists will, but like, you&rsquo;re just not actually going to understand the substance</p>
<p>of what they&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>What I think is way, way more productive is, um, to let yourself get really interested</p>
<p>in the phenomena that are still deep, but which you have a chance of understanding because</p>
<p>the path to getting to like even understanding what questions these theories of everything</p>
<p>are trying to answer involves like walking down that, um, I mean, I was watching a video</p>
<p>before I came here about from Steve mold talking about, um, why sugar polarizes light in a</p>
<p>certain way.</p>
<p>So fascinating, like really, really interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like this novel theory of everything type thing, but to understand what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on there really requires digging in in depth to certain ideas.</p>
<p>And if you let yourself think past what the video tells you about what does circularly</p>
<p>polarized light mean and things like that, it actually would get you to a pretty good</p>
<p>appreciation of like two state states and quantum systems, um, in a way that just trying</p>
<p>to read about like, Oh, what&rsquo;s the, um, what are the hard parts about resolving quantum</p>
<p>field theories with general relativity is never going to get you.</p>
<p>So as far as popularizing science is concerned, like the audience should be less interested</p>
<p>than they are in theories of everything.</p>
<p>Um, the popularizers should be less emphatic than they are about that for like actual practicing</p>
<p>physicists.</p>
<p>And that might be the case.</p>
<p>Maybe more people should think about fundamental questions, but it&rsquo;s difficult to create, uh,</p>
<p>like a three blue, one brown video on the theory of everything.</p>
<p>So basically we should really try to find the beauty in mathematics or physics by looking</p>
<p>at concepts that are like within reach.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s super important.</p>
<p>I mean, so you see this in math too with, um, the big unsolved problems.</p>
<p>So like the clay millennium problems, Riemann hypothesis, um, have you ever done a video</p>
<p>on Fermat&rsquo;s last theorem?</p>
<p>No, I have not yet.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But if I did, do you know what I would do?</p>
<p>I would talk about, um, proving Fermat&rsquo;s last theorem in the specific case of N equals</p>
<p>three.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Is that still accessible though?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Actually barely.</p>
<p>Um, Mathologer might be able to do like a great job on this.</p>
<p>He does a good job of taking stuff that&rsquo;s barely accessible and making it, but the,</p>
<p>the core ideas of proving it for N equals three are hard, but they do get you real ideas</p>
<p>about algebraic number theory.</p>
<p>And it involves looking at a number field that&rsquo;s, uh, it lives in the complex plane.</p>
<p>It looks like a hexagonal lattice and you start asking questions about factoring numbers</p>
<p>in this hexagonal lattice.</p>
<p>So it takes a while, but I&rsquo;ve talked about this sort of like lattice arithmetic, um,</p>
<p>in other contexts and you can get to a okay understanding of that.</p>
<p>And the things that make Fermat&rsquo;s last theorem hard are actually quite deep.</p>
<p>Um, and so the cases that we can solve it for, it&rsquo;s like you can get these broad sweeps</p>
<p>based on some hard, but like accessible, um, bits of number theory.</p>
<p>But before you can even understand why the general case is as hard as it is, you have</p>
<p>to walk through those.</p>
<p>And so any other attempt to describe it would just end up being like shallow and not really</p>
<p>productive for the viewer&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>Um, I think the same goes for, uh, most like unsolved problem type things where I think,</p>
<p>you know, as a kid, I was actually very inspired by the twin prime conjecture, um, that like</p>
<p>totally sucked me in as this thing that was understandable.</p>
<p>I kind of had this dream like, Oh, maybe I&rsquo;ll be the one to prove the twin prime conjecture</p>
<p>and new math that I would learn would be like viewed through this lens of like, Oh, maybe</p>
<p>I can apply it to that in some way.</p>
<p>But, uh, you sort of mature to a point where you realize that, uh, you should spend your</p>
<p>brain cycles on problems that you will see resolved because then you&rsquo;re going to grow</p>
<p>to see what it feels like for these things to be resolved rather than spending your brain</p>
<p>cycles on something where it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not going to pan out.</p>
<p>Um, and the people who do make progress towards these things like James Maynard, uh, is a</p>
<p>great example here of like young creative mathematician who like pushes in the direction</p>
<p>of things like the twin prime conjecture rather than hitting that head on, just see all the</p>
<p>interesting questions that are hard for similar reasons, but become more tractable and let</p>
<p>themselves really engage with those.</p>
<p>Um, so I think people should get in that habit.</p>
<p>I think the popularization of physics should encourage that habit through things like the</p>
<p>physics of simple everyday phenomena, because it can get quite deep.</p>
<p>And um, yeah, I think I, you know, I&rsquo;ve, I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of the interest that, you know,</p>
<p>people send me messages asking to explain Weinstein&rsquo;s thing or asking to explain Wolfram&rsquo;s</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>One, I don&rsquo;t understand them, but more importantly, um, it&rsquo;s too big a bite to, you shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be interested in those, right?</p>
<p>The giant sort of a ball of interesting ideas.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably a million of interesting ideas in there that individually could be</p>
<p>explored effectively.</p>
<p>And to be clear, you should be interested in fundamental questions.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a good habit to ask what the fundamentals of things are, but I think it</p>
<p>takes a lot of steps to like, certainly you shouldn&rsquo;t be trying to answer that unless</p>
<p>you actually understand quantum field theory and you actually understand general relativity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the cool thing about like your videos, people who haven&rsquo;t done mathematics, like</p>
<p>if you really give it time, watch it a couple of times and like try to try to reason about</p>
<p>it, you can actually understand the concept that&rsquo;s being explained.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not a coincidence that the things I&rsquo;m describing aren&rsquo;t like the most, um, up</p>
<p>to date, uh, progress on the Riemann hypothesis cousins or, um, like there&rsquo;s context in which</p>
<p>the analog of the Riemann hypothesis has been solved in like more, uh, discrete feeling</p>
<p>finite settings that are more well behaved.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not describing that because it just takes a ton to get there.</p>
<p>And instead I think it&rsquo;ll be like productive to have an actual understanding of something</p>
<p>that can, you can pack into 20 minutes.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s beautifully put ultimately.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where like the most satisfying thing is when you really understand, um, yeah, really</p>
<p>understand, build a habit of feeling what it&rsquo;s like to actually come to resolution.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>As opposed to, which it can also be enjoyable, but just being in awe of the fact that you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t understand anything.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll get entertainment out of that, but it&rsquo;s not as fulfilling as understanding</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t grow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, but also just the fulfilling, it really does feel good when you first don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>something and then you do, that&rsquo;s a beautiful feeling.</p>
<p>Hey, let me ask you one, uh, last, last time we got awkward and weird about, uh, a fear</p>
<p>of mortality, which you made fun of me off, but let me ask you on the, the other absurd</p>
<p>question is, um, what do you think is, uh, the meaning of our life of meaning of life?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry if I made fun of you about, no, you didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just joking.</p>
<p>It was great.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think life has a meaning.</p>
<p>I think like meaning, I don&rsquo;t understand the question.</p>
<p>I think meaning is something that&rsquo;s described to stuff that&rsquo;s created with purpose.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a meaning to, uh, like this water bottle label and that someone created it with</p>
<p>a purpose of conveying meaning.</p>
<p>And there was like one consciousness that wanted to get its ideas into another consciousness.</p>
<p>Um, most things don&rsquo;t have that property.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit like if I asked you, um, like what is the height, all right, so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all relative.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be like the height of what you can&rsquo;t ask.</p>
<p>What is the height without an object?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t ask what is the meaning of life without like an intentful consciousness, putting</p>
<p>it like, I guess I&rsquo;m revealing I&rsquo;m not very religious, but you know, the mathematics of</p>
<p>everything seems kind of beautiful.</p>
<p>It seems like, it seems like there&rsquo;s some kind of structure relative to which, I mean,</p>
<p>you could calculate the height.</p>
<p>Well, so, but what I&rsquo;m saying is I don&rsquo;t understand the question.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of life in that?</p>
<p>I think people might be asking something very real.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand what they&rsquo;re asking.</p>
<p>Are they asking like, why does life exist?</p>
<p>Like how did it come about?</p>
<p>What are the natural laws?</p>
<p>Are they asking, um, as I&rsquo;m making decisions day by day for what should I do?</p>
<p>What is the guiding light that inspires like, what should I do?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what people are kind of asking.</p>
<p>But also like why the thing that gives you joy about education, about mathematics, what</p>
<p>the hell is that?</p>
<p>Like what interactions with other people, interactions with like minded people, I think</p>
<p>is the meaning of, in that sense, bringing others joy, essentially, like in something</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve created, it connects with others somehow and the same and the vice versa.</p>
<p>I think that that is what, um, when we use the word meaning to mean like you&rsquo;re sort</p>
<p>of filled with a sense of happiness and energy to create more things, like I have so much</p>
<p>meaning taken from this, like that, yeah, that&rsquo;s what fuels, fuels my pump at least.</p>
<p>So a life alone on a desert island would be kind of meaningless.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You want to be alone together with someone.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re all alone together.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s no better way to end it, Grant.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been, first time we talked, it was amazing again, it&rsquo;s a huge honor that you</p>
<p>make time for me.</p>
<p>I appreciate talking with you.</p>

<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Richard Feynman.</p>
<p>I have a friend who&rsquo;s an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I don&rsquo;t agree with very</p>
<p>well.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll hold up a flower and say, look how beautiful it is, and I&rsquo;ll agree.</p>
<p>Then he says, I as an artist can see how beautiful this is, but you as a scientist take this</p>
<p>all apart and it becomes a dull thing.</p>
<p>And I think he&rsquo;s kind of nutty.</p>
<p>First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe.</p>
<p>Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is, I can appreciate the beauty of a</p>
<p>flower.</p>
<p>At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees.</p>
<p>I can imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not just beauty at this dimension at one centimeter, there&rsquo;s also beauty at</p>
<p>smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes.</p>
<p>The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it</p>
<p>is interesting.</p>
<p>It means that insects can see the color.</p>
<p>It adds a question.</p>
<p>Does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms?</p>
<p>Why is it aesthetic?</p>
<p>All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement,</p>
<p>the mystery and the awe of a flower.</p>
<p>It only adds.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand how it subtracts.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
