    <p>(audience chatters)</p>
<ul>
<li>Good afternoon, everyone,</li>
</ul>
<p>and welcome to today&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dean&rsquo;s Speaker Series.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am really excited</p>
<p>to introduce today&rsquo;s guest, Dan Schulman.</p>
<p>We are really thrilled that Dan is joining us</p>
<p>and even more thrilled that he is joining us here in person.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, Dan.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>(Ann claps)</p>
<p>Dan became the president and the CEO of PayPal in 2014.</p>
<p>His current leadership role follows three decades</p>
<p>of experience in a number of leadership roles</p>
<p>and responsibilities at organizations</p>
<p>across the telecom sector.</p>
<p>Prior to PayPal, he served as group president</p>
<p>at American Express</p>
<p>and before that as founding CEO for eight years</p>
<p>with Virgin Mobile USA.</p>
<p>Dan also spent 18 years at AT&amp;T,</p>
<p>where he held a series of positions,</p>
<p>including president of the Consumer Markets Division.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly,</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s notable leadership success and impact</p>
<p>had been recognized by many organizations.</p>
<p>In 2021, he was ranked in the top three</p>
<p>of Fortune&rsquo;s list of the world&rsquo;s greatest leaders,</p>
<p>an honor that recognized individual</p>
<p>for their leadership throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been frequently recognized by Fortune</p>
<p>as one of the top-20 businesspersons of the year,</p>
<p>and Dan has been named one</p>
<p>of the top 100 most creative people</p>
<p>by Fast Company.</p>
<p>In addition to his daily responsibilities at PayPal,</p>
<p>Dan is also actively involved in the World Economic Forum.</p>
<p>He also serves on the board of directors</p>
<p>of the Business Roundtable,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a life member of the council of foreign relations.</p>
<p>Dan is a leader who goes beyond himself,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s an exemplar of the Berkeley leader.</p>
<p>He has been quoted as saying</p>
<p>that he believes social activism is in his DNA,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s uses his leadership positions</p>
<p>to push that quality forward,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m really, really looking forward</p>
<p>to having a longer conversation with him</p>
<p>about how he does that.</p>
<p>Dan, on behalf of all of us here at Haas,</p>
<p>thank you so much for being here today.</p>
<p>Please, join me again in welcoming Dan Schulman.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>Maybe just to get us started,</p>
<p>maybe we can start by looking in the rearview mirror,</p>
<p>and you could just give us an idea or a glimpse</p>
<p>into, over the years, are there certain experiences</p>
<p>or certain individuals</p>
<p>who have really affected you</p>
<p>and really changed who you became and how you lead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, that introduction did that.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was one of them.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>I wish my mom was here to see that or hear it.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>Look, I think we&rsquo;re all (tuts) products of our parents.</p>
<p>Whether that&rsquo;s good or bad,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re definitely products of them.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was fortunate to have</p>
<p>two great very socially aware</p>
<p>and very progressive parents.</p>
<p>My mom and dad taught (chuckles) me a lotta lessons.</p>
<p>I was a little bit rambunctious as a youth,</p>
<p>and my dad always said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son, you&rsquo;re born with two ears and one mouth,</p>
<p>and you should use them proportionately,&rdquo;</p>
<p>which was good advice.</p>
<p>I watched them advocate</p>
<p>for issues that were unpopular</p>
<p>in certain places in our country.</p>
<p>My dad was promoted</p>
<p>to be a plant manager.</p>
<p>He worked at a chemical corporation.</p>
<p>The facility manager down in Mississippi</p>
<p>fired this black guy</p>
<p>for drinking outta the wrong water fountain.</p>
<p>My dad went down to Mississippi to reverse that,</p>
<p>and I remember my mom;</p>
<p>this is during the whole civil rights movement,</p>
<p>where people were being beaten up</p>
<p>and people were being killed;</p>
<p>just hanging by the phone</p>
<p>wondering what was gonna happen to my dad</p>
<p>and just the catch in her voice</p>
<p>when he called and said he was okay.</p>
<p>And there are things like that that always affect you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had great mentors along the way.</p>
<p>Gail McGovern, who&rsquo;s now the head of the Red Cross,</p>
<p>mentored me for many years.</p>
<p>Richard Branson, who I worked with at Virgin,</p>
<p>was a big advocate</p>
<p>for corporations being a force for good in the world.</p>
<p>I learned a lot from him and Desmond Tutu</p>
<p>and others that surrounded us at the time,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ve had a lot</p>
<p>of fortunate encounters and mentors along the way,</p>
<p>my parents though being primary among them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you for that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for that.</p>
<p>What kind of leader do you consider yourself?</p>
<ul>
<li>You know, great one.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Ann laughs) (audience laughs)</p>
<p>(Dan laughs)</p>
<ul>
<li>[Ann] Round of applause for that.</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think leadership involves a lot</li>
</ul>
<p>of different elements to it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done martial arts my whole life.</p>
<p>For 50 years, I&rsquo;ve done martial arts,</p>
<p>this form called Krav Maga,</p>
<p>which is the Israeli martial arts form.</p>
<p>I think you learn a lot through martial arts.</p>
<p>You learn to be very, very humble</p>
<p>because no matter</p>
<p>who you&rsquo;re getting into a ring with</p>
<p>or who you might potentially be fighting&hellip;</p>
<p>First of all, a tremendous amount of respect for them.</p>
<p>And no matter who they are,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re probably gonna hit you</p>
<p>and probably gonna hurt you and could very well beat you,</p>
<p>and so you learn to be very humble.</p>
<p>You learn that you never know it all,</p>
<p>that you always have to listen intently and learn.</p>
<p>And you know</p>
<p>to not be aggressive.</p>
<p>You would think it&rsquo;d be counterintuitive</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;d martial arts for a long time,</p>
<p>but the best way to win a fight</p>
<p>is to walk away from a fight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not to get engaged in the fight,</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s really served me quite well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a quiet confidence that comes from it:</p>
<p>a lotta humility, a lot of listening, a lot of learning,</p>
<p>and a huge amount of respect</p>
<p>for not just everyone you interact with</p>
<p>but your customers, your competition.</p>
<p>The one other thing I&rsquo;ve learned in martial arts</p>
<p>is you should never ever stand still in a ring.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re fighting, you always wanna be moving,</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause the moment you stand still is the moment you get hit.</p>
<p>And I feel that&rsquo;s the same way in business.</p>
<p>You constantly need to be innovating and pushing yourself,</p>
<p>or inevitably you&rsquo;ll find out that you&rsquo;re falling behind.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you. Thank you for sharing that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your leadership qualities, it reminds me</p>
<p>of something that we&rsquo;re really proud of</p>
<p>here at Berkeley Hass.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really proud of our defining leadership principles.</p>
<p>One of them is exactly what you were talking about,</p>
<p>confidence without attitude.</p>
<p>Our students are really remarkable</p>
<p>for that confidence without&hellip;</p>
<p>I guess you could call it humility.</p>
<ul>
<li>Confidence with attitude is insecurity.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I think.</p>
<ul>
<li>Whoa. That&rsquo;s a great point.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have this idea of a Berkeley leader</p>
<p>as taking the longer view,</p>
<p>thinking about going beyond themselves,</p>
<p>another leadership quality that we really celebrate,</p>
<p>so along those lines,</p>
<p>do you think that there&rsquo;s an inherent conflict</p>
<p>between profit and purpose?</p>
<p>Or do you think those can actually be combined?</p>
<ul>
<li>I could be in the minority in thinking this,</li>
</ul>
<p>but I think more and more people are beginning</p>
<p>to think this way, at least CEOs that I&rsquo;m good friends with.</p>
<p>I think, actually, profit and purpose</p>
<p>work hand in hand together.</p>
<p>There may be a disconnect in the timing around some of that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about that in a second,</p>
<p>but I think</p>
<p>the number-one most important constituency</p>
<p>of any company</p>
<p>of any CEO</p>
<p>is the passion and the quality</p>
<p>of employees that work with them.</p>
<p>Give me a great set</p>
<p>of engaged passionate employees</p>
<p>with a mediocre strategy,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll bet on that team all the time</p>
<p>versus a great strategy (chuckles)</p>
<p>with mediocre employees.</p>
<p>And I think the best employees want</p>
<p>to work at a company</p>
<p>that is trying to make a difference in the world,</p>
<p>that has a mission that resonates,</p>
<p>and that has a set of values</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t just words on a wall but are things</p>
<p>that you actively participate in.</p>
<p>Yeah, I been called an activist CEO,</p>
<p>and there are times where people are like,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you standing up for that issue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And we could talk about those,</p>
<p>and I really think of myself</p>
<p>as a concerned citizen of the world.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any way</p>
<p>to be disconnected</p>
<p>from the communities around us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all inextricably linked</p>
<p>and tied together,</p>
<p>and so I don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s a disconnect.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s actually a connection between the two.</p>
<p>I do think that at times,</p>
<p>if people are looking to optimize profits next quarter</p>
<p>versus over the medium to long term,</p>
<p>you may be doing some things&hellip;</p>
<p>We did a $535 million commitment</p>
<p>to really do our part in advocating</p>
<p>for reducing the racial wealth gap</p>
<p>in our country.</p>
<p>That was a large amount of money.</p>
<p>This is post the death of George Floyd,</p>
<p>and it was really&hellip;</p>
<p>I felt like after talking</p>
<p>to a couple black leaders in the country</p>
<p>that this needed to be a moment over time,</p>
<p>not a moment in time,</p>
<p>and so I felt like we really needed to invest</p>
<p>in a very meaningful way</p>
<p>that obviously impacted some profits over the short term,</p>
<p>but I feel like it unleashed a torrent</p>
<p>of emotion inside PayPal and pride</p>
<p>and attracted quite a number</p>
<p>of really talented people to the company.</p>
<p>And so I feel like that was the right thing to do,</p>
<p>but if you were looking to optimize the next quarter,</p>
<p>it probably wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>A related question is</p>
<p>when does it make sense</p>
<p>for a company PayPal</p>
<p>to take a political stance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking in particular&hellip;</p>
<p>I know that PayPal canceled</p>
<p>its Charlotte, North Carolina, expansion plans</p>
<p>after a controversial bathroom law was passed there,</p>
<p>so how do you decide</p>
<p>when and if PayPal takes a political stance?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I try very hard</li>
</ul>
<p>not to take political stance.</p>
<p>I try to take values-based stance.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re often conflated,</p>
<p>but I would say we&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>in our country at least&hellip;</p>
<p>Our country has, I think, a set of values.</p>
<p>I think they can transcend the political spectrum.</p>
<p>In North Carolina, we withdrew from North Carolina.</p>
<p>It was very public.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize that it was gonna be front page</p>
<p>of &ldquo;The New York Times&rdquo;</p>
<p>and that I was gonna receive</p>
<p>multiple, multiple death threats</p>
<p>as a result of it,</p>
<p>not be able to go into a bathroom</p>
<p>without security checking the stalls.</p>
<p>That was pretty lonely at the time,</p>
<p>but I feel like that wasn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>And that was because of the so-called bathroom bill,</p>
<p>HB2, House Bill 2,</p>
<p>which I felt allowed</p>
<p>for the potential discrimination against somebody</p>
<p>for their sexual orientation or sexual identity.</p>
<p>And I felt like that was anathema to the values of PayPal.</p>
<p>Our number-one value is</p>
<p>how do we create an inclusive company.</p>
<p>I love Justin Trudeau&rsquo;s dad&rsquo;s quote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diversity is a fact,</p>
<p>but inclusion is a choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt like if that&rsquo;s our number-one value,</p>
<p>we need to stand up for it.</p>
<p>Yeah, we had had this big press conference</p>
<p>with the governor</p>
<p>of North Carolina,</p>
<p>and he gave us the bowl of North Carolina,</p>
<p>which was this wooden bowl</p>
<p>that was carved out of a tree that was struck by lightning</p>
<p>in front of the state capitol.</p>
<p>This is important &lsquo;cause we lost the bowl,</p>
<p>and after we withdrew, he demanded the bowl back,</p>
<p>and we couldn&rsquo;t find it,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Oh. (laughs) (audience laughs)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s true, Governor. We could not find it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We really were not just hiding it from you.</p>
<p>(audience members laugh)</p>
<p>Anyway, I really tried to&hellip;</p>
<p>I forgot to talk to my board about it,</p>
<p>because I felt it was so ingrained in our values</p>
<p>that we had to stand up for it.</p>
<p>And I was in front</p>
<p>of a auditorium like this</p>
<p>but full of special operations people</p>
<p>in San Diego</p>
<p>talking at one of their graduation,</p>
<p>and I was talking about this, which is really</p>
<p>around transgendered and sexual orientation.</p>
<p>And I could see everyone in the audience.</p>
<p>Their arms were crossed like this.</p>
<p>This was not a thing that they were really gung-ho about,</p>
<p>and I said, &ldquo;Look, not everybody has to agree</p>
<p>with what we did,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t feel like that was a red issue or a blue issue.</p>
<p>I felt it was a red, white, and blue issue.</p>
<p>I felt like our country is founded</p>
<p>on the principle</p>
<p>that we should not discriminate against people in any way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very slowly, they all got up</p>
<p>and gave a standing ovation on that,</p>
<p>and I felt like that was such a moment for me</p>
<p>to see what could be</p>
<p>a more conservative element in our country</p>
<p>saying, &ldquo;You know what?</p>
<p>Standing up for difficult things like that,</p>
<p>getting death threats,</p>
<p>taking a more difficult stand,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what we all should do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have the moral responsibility to do that.</p>
<p>And so I try to take stands</p>
<p>where they involve</p>
<p>the values of PayPal.</p>
<p>Not always easy to do by the way.</p>
<p>We remove a lot</p>
<p>of groups every single day every single month</p>
<p>from our platform.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t allow them to raise money</p>
<p>either on Venmo or PayPal</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re gonna advocate hatred</p>
<p>or racial intolerance or violence.</p>
<p>And I feel like that&rsquo;s our responsibility.</p>
<p>I am going to go do that.</p>
<p>Even though people will disagree with a lot of our choices</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a nobody&hellip;</p>
<p>You probably don&rsquo;t teach it here.</p>
<p>Nobody teaches where free speech and hatred</p>
<p>cross, and so you have to make</p>
<p>very difficult decisions sometimes on that.</p>
<p>You also need to know code</p>
<p>because somebody could Venmo you 88 cents,</p>
<p>and you may think that that&rsquo;s great you just got 88 cents,</p>
<p>but 88 cents is a hate trope.</p>
<p>Eighth letter of the alphabet is H.</p>
<p>Eight eight is HH which is heil Hitler,</p>
<p>so you need to know,</p>
<p>and $16.88, 16 are the 16 words</p>
<p>of the white nationalist manifesto,</p>
<p>and so there a lotta things you need to know</p>
<p>to take down different groups.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not straightforward,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s our responsibility to do that.</p>
<p>When we take down Proud Boys or other things,</p>
<p>I always get death threats after that kind of thing,</p>
<p>but I feel like that&rsquo;s who we should be as a company.</p>
<p>Once you go (chuckles) down that path,</p>
<p>you need to stay true to those values.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always easy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you for sharing that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I think I understand</p>
<p>why you have security here with you today.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Dan] &lsquo;Cause of the mean students of Berkeley, yeah.</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience laughs) (Ann laughs)</p>
<p>(Dan laughs)</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, well, our students are, I would say, amazing,</li>
</ul>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not too worried about that.</p>
<ul>
<li>I was kidding of course.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Ann laughs) (audience laughs)</p>
<p>Nobody take that outta context. Deal.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a totally different note,</li>
</ul>
<p>let&rsquo;s shift to the pandemic</p>
<p>and how that is affected PayPal.</p>
<p>The pandemic has led to some benefits.</p>
<p>Many of us have spent a lot more time at home,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also led to tremendous challenges,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s also led to tremendous inequities.</p>
<p>Different parts of our country has been affected massively.</p>
<p>Mortality rates / sicknesses are much higher</p>
<p>in the black and brown parts of our population.</p>
<p>But just out of curiosity,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just start with a simple question,</p>
<p>which is what does the future of work look like at PayPal.</p>
<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s a simple question? Okay.</li>
</ul>
<p>(all laugh)</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait for the hard question.</p>
<p>Well, overnight, we went</p>
<p>from having 67 major offices around the world</p>
<p>to having 40,000</p>
<p>because everybody had their own office now from home.</p>
<p>And if you had asked me a year before</p>
<p>could we fully go remote in two weeks,</p>
<p>close down every (chuckles) office,</p>
<p>create actually secure links, protect data&hellip;</p>
<p>If I had asked my team that,</p>
<p>they probably would&rsquo;ve come back with a two-year Gantt chart</p>
<p>and &ldquo;here are all the risks,</p>
<p>and we gotta figure out policies and procedures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So one thing it taught me</p>
<p>is when you have to, anything is possible.</p>
<p>Anything is possible,</p>
<p>and it really opened my eyes</p>
<p>to what you can do when you must do it,</p>
<p>when you have no choice.</p>
<p>The other thing is the pandemic, for employees&hellip;</p>
<p>First, our North Star</p>
<p>was the physical wellness of employees,</p>
<p>making sure if they needed ventilators,</p>
<p>we could get it to them.</p>
<p>We went all out to take care of our employees,</p>
<p>and then we realized</p>
<p>that it wasn&rsquo;t just their physical health.</p>
<p>It was their mental well-being as well</p>
<p>because mental stress went up dramatically.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t matter who you were.</p>
<p>If you were women,</p>
<p>our workforce had to juggle in many ways,</p>
<p>not just work but taking care of kids that were at home.</p>
<p>Families got fractured on this.</p>
<p>People who were single felt incredibly lonely</p>
<p>and were despondent and depressed.</p>
<p>And so every part of our population</p>
<p>was affected mentally by this.</p>
<p>We actually withdrew performance evaluations</p>
<p>because we felt it was fundamentally unfair</p>
<p>for some people who were taking care of kids and couldn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>I felt it was unfair to go and do that.</p>
<p>And the other thing we did</p>
<p>is we figured physical health, mental health,</p>
<p>and then financial wellbeing</p>
<p>because of what&hellip;</p>
<p>You mentioned this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just talk about the U.S.,</p>
<p>but this goes across the world.</p>
<p>2/3 of the U.S. population</p>
<p>struggle to make ends meet at the end of the month, 2/3.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a certain proportion of our population.</p>
<p>The vast majority of our population in the U.S.</p>
<p>struggles to make ends meet.</p>
<p>I thought that would never be true inside PayPal</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re a tech company.</p>
<p>We pay above market rates everywhere</p>
<p>for every position,</p>
<p>which is why many of you</p>
<p>wanna come and work at PayPal someday,</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>including, hopefully, our values,</p>
<p>but what I found out when we did a survey</p>
<p>is all of our entry-level employees</p>
<p>and our call center employees</p>
<p>were struggling to make ends meet.</p>
<p>And what it really taught me is that&hellip;</p>
<p>This is a bold statement</p>
<p>that I made in the middle of Wall Street.</p>
<p>It was not looked on fondly.</p>
<p>But capitalism is not working</p>
<p>for a big part of our population.</p>
<p>The market is not working</p>
<p>I would&rsquo;ve thought,</p>
<p>because as we pay above market,</p>
<p>that we would&rsquo;ve been paying fair wages,</p>
<p>but we weren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and we created this measure called NDI,</p>
<p>net disposable income,</p>
<p>how much money does somebody have after they pay all</p>
<p>of their taxes and essential living expenses.</p>
<p>And we did a study with some academia,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ll start working with you on some of these,</p>
<p>which basically said</p>
<p>for somebody to be financially healthy and secure,</p>
<p>they needed to have 20% NDI.</p>
<p>20% of their income after</p>
<p>needed to be put into savings and unexpected expenses,</p>
<p>and our NDI for all our call center entry-level employees,</p>
<p>which is 50% of our employee base,</p>
<p>was between 4 and 6%.</p>
<p>And so no wonder they were struggling to make ends meet.</p>
<p>And so we basically said</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna lower the cost of healthcare benefits by 67%</p>
<p>for these employees</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t have to choose</p>
<p>between food on the table and healthcare benefits,</p>
<p>raise wages, give everybody equity in the company,</p>
<p>and surround all of that</p>
<p>with the financial education program</p>
<p>because many didn&rsquo;t have equity before,</p>
<p>never had savings before,</p>
<p>and today the minimum</p>
<p>right now is 18% NDI inside PayPal.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this year, we&rsquo;ll get to 20%,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s definitely our targeting.</p>
<p>We will get there,</p>
<p>but those are some of the things that you had to go do.</p>
<p>Coming back to the office and what form that takes,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re well underway of thinking about that,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also of the opinion you shouldn&rsquo;t be dogmatic.</p>
<p>There shouldn&rsquo;t be a two-three or a three-two.</p>
<p>Every team needs to figure out</p>
<p>where do they need to be together</p>
<p>and where can they work remotely</p>
<p>and what form does that look like.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the direction that we&rsquo;re going.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you. Thank you for that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m gonna switch gears again</p>
<p>and think more broadly</p>
<p>about the future of fintech</p>
<p>and the future of an inclusive fintech world.</p>
<p>I used to work at the World Bank,</p>
<p>and one day I found myself in Bogota, Columbia,</p>
<p>and the president was giving a lecture to a couple of us.</p>
<p>And I was really surprised</p>
<p>because he was explaining</p>
<p>that if you wanted to withdraw money&hellip;</p>
<p>If you went to a teller machine,</p>
<p>you wanted to withdraw money,</p>
<p>just to withdraw a little bit of money,</p>
<p>that was a $5 cost.</p>
<p>You were charged $5,</p>
<p>so clearly, very expensive.</p>
<p>And one issue that we&rsquo;ve already talked about</p>
<p>is how to make the world more inclusive</p>
<p>and how to make fintech more inclusive.</p>
<p>So just by way of introduction,</p>
<p>what do you see</p>
<p>about the biggest problems</p>
<p>in the way that the financial industry is set up?</p>
<p>Why would it be the case at a place like Columbia</p>
<p>that just to withdraw a couple dollars</p>
<p>might actually cost you $5?</p>
<ul>
<li>Because it&rsquo;s expensive to be poor.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is the unfortunate truth,</p>
<p>and that is a saying that is very true</p>
<p>in the financial services industry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s backwards, completely backwards,</p>
<p>but the less money you have,</p>
<p>the more it costs you to manage and move it.</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a checking account,</p>
<p>then you have to stand in line for 30 or 40 minutes</p>
<p>to cash a check.</p>
<p>You can spend anywhere between 3 and 5%</p>
<p>of the value of that check</p>
<p>to cash it,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s if everything works right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done this.</p>
<p>I have everyone in PayPal go out</p>
<p>as if they don&rsquo;t have credit cards or anything,</p>
<p>and so I was standing in line for a cash-checking facility.</p>
<p>This is, by the way, where a lotta people get robbed</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where the money is.</p>
<p>People (chuckles) are walking out with cash afterwards.</p>
<p>And my check was written out to Dan Schulman,</p>
<p>and my driver&rsquo;s license was Daniel Schulman,</p>
<p>so they wouldn&rsquo;t cash it.</p>
<p>And they said, &ldquo;But if you wanna cash it,</p>
<p>you can go up to an apartment down the block</p>
<p>on the fifth floor, this room,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll cash it for you,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;ll cost you a lot more,&rdquo;</p>
<p>and at that point, I thought, &ldquo;Well, okay,</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t worth the exercise (laughs)</p>
<p>for me to go and do this anymore,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause I didn&rsquo;t know what was up there.</p>
<p>And then by the way, when you get that cash</p>
<p>and then you wanna pay a bill,</p>
<p>then you have to spend another line</p>
<p>to do a bill payment where you can&hellip;</p>
<p>To pay a cable bill can cost you $10</p>
<p>just to pay the cable bill</p>
<p>for the bill-pay location.</p>
<p>So this idea of it&rsquo;s expensive to be poor</p>
<p>is rampant across the financial industry,</p>
<p>and it affects those with the lowest incomes something&hellip;</p>
<p>Last year, 140 billion was spent</p>
<p>on unnecessary fees and high interest rates</p>
<p>for those who can at least afford it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about 10% of their disposable income is spent on this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same amount that they spend on food,</p>
<p>so this is crazy,</p>
<p>especially when you could use technology now.</p>
<p>You have all the power of a bank branch</p>
<p>in the palm of your hand</p>
<p>with your mobile phones, with your smartphones.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to stand in line anymore.</p>
<p>You can instantaneously do something.</p>
<p>If I sent a remittance to Columbia from here traditionally,</p>
<p>only 92 cents</p>
<p>of that dollar I sent to people who really need it</p>
<p>would get to them.</p>
<p>If you did electronically,</p>
<p>that could be done at&hellip;</p>
<p>97-98 cents would get there;</p>
<p>should be even less than that;</p>
<p>but instantaneously, too,</p>
<p>not a week to go and do this,</p>
<p>not people having to remember passwords.</p>
<p>I tried to do this with my daughter.</p>
<p>I sent her a remittance,</p>
<p>and she couldn&rsquo;t remember her password.</p>
<p>Then I sent her, and then I couldn&rsquo;t remember it.</p>
<p>It was a mess,</p>
<p>and I can send money to you</p>
<p>via PayPal or Zoom or Venmo instantaneously.</p>
<p>I can be at a stoplight and be paying my (chuckles) bills.</p>
<p>My daughter&rsquo;s always running outta money,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m always her bank</p>
<p>and sending her money (audience laughs)</p>
<p>wherever I am,</p>
<p>which she needs desperately at that moment.</p>
<p>It really can change the face of the way</p>
<p>basic transactions are done,</p>
<p>and I think this is really, really important.</p>
<p>I said 2/3 of Americans struggle to make ends meet,</p>
<p>and I talked about capitalism being broken</p>
<p>for a big part of our population.</p>
<p>I think financial health is the bedrock</p>
<p>of a functioning democracy,</p>
<p>and what do I mean by that?</p>
<p>If you struggle to make ends meet,</p>
<p>and you feel like the system is letting you down</p>
<p>all the time, no matter how hard you work,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t make ends meet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first generation</p>
<p>that thinks that their kids will not do better than they do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fundamental to part of the American dream.</p>
<p>People tend to radicalize.</p>
<p>They either drift to the right or to the left,</p>
<p>and you see this in&hellip;</p>
<p>At one point, I thought the election was gonna be</p>
<p>between Bernie Sanders on one side</p>
<p>and Donald Trump on the other side.</p>
<p>These are two extreme candidates on either side,</p>
<p>more left, more right, much less centrist,</p>
<p>much less people</p>
<p>who are thinking about things holistically.</p>
<p>My favorite quote about democracy is</p>
<p>&ldquo;it needs to be more</p>
<p>than two wolves and one lamb</p>
<p>voting on what to have for dinner,&rdquo; okay?</p>
<p>So think about that,</p>
<p>because you have to rise above your own self-interest</p>
<p>to figure out what is right.</p>
<p>The era of statesmanship seems to be</p>
<p>on the decline,</p>
<p>and a strong democracy rests</p>
<p>on people having some degree of financial health,</p>
<p>believing in the future,</p>
<p>having the ability to dream about what could be.</p>
<p>And I think</p>
<p>it is something that gets me up every single day</p>
<p>that motivates me</p>
<p>because I do think part of the solution</p>
<p>is rooted in technology</p>
<p>and what we can do to radically bring down costs.</p>
<p>That can be in electronic.</p>
<p>It could be in blockchain.</p>
<p>It could be in a number of different methodologies.</p>
<p>But I do think we play a crucial role in that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you, Dan. Oh, sorry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you, Dan.</p>
<p>In 10 minutes, we&rsquo;ll have opportunities</p>
<p>for you to ask follow-up questions</p>
<p>if you would like to ask questions,</p>
<p>so think about any questions you might have for Dan.</p>
<p>In a related issue, you talk a lot</p>
<p>about the importance of building trust</p>
<p>as a business priority,</p>
<p>and you also talk about the importance of building trust</p>
<p>with your stakeholders,</p>
<p>with the stakeholders at a broader level.</p>
<p>How do you do that as a company?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I think trust is foundational.</li>
</ul>
<p>PayPal was recently voted</p>
<p>as the number-two most trusted brand in the world.</p>
<p>And I think</p>
<p>trust is built up over years,</p>
<p>unfortunately, can dissipate in moments,</p>
<p>in days and weeks.</p>
<p>And to me,</p>
<p>for a financial services company&hellip;</p>
<p>At our heart, we&rsquo;re financial services.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re obviously a tech company.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a financial services company.</p>
<p>You need trust,</p>
<p>and trust, to me, is built on a couple of components,</p>
<p>one, that we respect your privacy,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t sell any of your information,</p>
<p>number two, that your information is secure, which is</p>
<p>a constant threat,</p>
<p>cybersecurity, as we&rsquo;re seeing today</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a constant threat.</p>
<p>Everything in our society is built</p>
<p>off of software.</p>
<p>The elevators we ride in,</p>
<p>the dams that hold back water,</p>
<p>our electrical grid,</p>
<p>our cars, our planes,</p>
<p>heart pacemakers, it&rsquo;s all built off of software.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re attacked a billion times a year</p>
<p>on people trying to get in,</p>
<p>and all of your ID and your passwords have been stolen.</p>
<p>You need to look on the dark web.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve all been stolen.</p>
<p>I would say probably 2/3 of yours, easily, have been stolen,</p>
<p>and I could find them if you want me to.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>So when you sign in to Venmo or to PayPal,</p>
<p>honestly, we pay almost no attention to it.</p>
<p>Jacks or better to open in the poker game.</p>
<p>We do about 270 checks</p>
<p>on every transaction</p>
<p>to make sure that it&rsquo;s you,</p>
<p>not who you say you are,</p>
<p>because you will sign in legitimately</p>
<p>with somebody else&rsquo;s username and password</p>
<p>but there are a ton of techniques</p>
<p>that enable me to know whether it&rsquo;s you or not.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t stop somebody from coming in.</p>
<p>Cyber used to be about these huge firewalls</p>
<p>and moats and turrets.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s all about DLP.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s making sure that your data is not leaked</p>
<p>out of the enterprise,</p>
<p>so you have to have a very sophisticated set</p>
<p>of cyber capabilities.</p>
<p>Yeah, so they&rsquo;re a number of things</p>
<p>that trust is built on:</p>
<p>security, privacy, and then transparency,</p>
<p>that if you say it&rsquo;s gonna do something,</p>
<p>it will do that,</p>
<p>that there aren&rsquo;t hidden charges somewhere.</p>
<p>We do nothing, nothing, in the world</p>
<p>without working with regulators.</p>
<p>We understand there&rsquo;s second- and third-order effects</p>
<p>of everything that we do,</p>
<p>and I consider our regulatory relationships</p>
<p>to be one of our big competitive advantages that we have.</p>
<p>The monetary system of the world is&hellip;</p>
<p>There are a lot of bad actors that try and come in.</p>
<p>We need to spot those bad actors</p>
<p>and prevent them from either taking your money</p>
<p>or doing human trafficking,</p>
<p>child sexploitation, illegal opioid, terrorist activities.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s on us to try and prevent.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you, Dan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s turn a little bit towards the future.</p>
<p>I have two daughters.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re 21, 26 years old.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always asking them when they leave the house,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have money?&rdquo; right?</p>
<p>My daughters have not carried a dollar bill or more,</p>
<p>for years, okay?</p>
<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s &lsquo;cause you pay them.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Ann laughs) (audience laughs)</p>
<p>No, I understand.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about cashless. (laughs)</p>
<ul>
<li>They don&rsquo;t have cash.</li>
</ul>
<p>Does this mean that we&rsquo;re headed for a cashless future?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, there&rsquo;s no question</li>
</ul>
<p>that the use of cash is dissipating.</p>
<p>Checks are becoming something of a yesteryear.</p>
<p>More and more is being subsumed</p>
<p>into the mobile phone.</p>
<p>10 years from now,</p>
<p>there won&rsquo;t really be credit cards or debit cards anymore,</p>
<p>that form factor.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll all be subsumed into the mobile phone</p>
<p>because tapping a card versus tapping your phone.</p>
<p>If I tap my phone, I can use all the software in that app.</p>
<p>I can delay my transaction.</p>
<p>I can split my transaction</p>
<p>between rewards points</p>
<p>or my crypto balances</p>
<p>or fiat currency.</p>
<p>Oh, I can get coupons.</p>
<p>I can get rewards points.</p>
<p>I can get a number of things if I use my phone,</p>
<p>so that form factor will evolve.</p>
<p>And by the way, when that form factor evolves,</p>
<p>a ton of things will change too.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be doing not just P2P transactions,</p>
<p>person-to-person transactions,</p>
<p>but P2M transactions, person to merchant transactions,</p>
<p>just right over our mobile phones.</p>
<p>And that will fundamentally change infrastructure</p>
<p>and rails that transactions ride on,</p>
<p>but we also need to know</p>
<p>that the death of cash has been predicted</p>
<p>by a lotta people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve always been wrong,</p>
<p>and part of that is there are privacy concerns, too,</p>
<p>that people have in the world.</p>
<p>Using cash, you can be anonymous,</p>
<p>and there are parts of the population</p>
<p>that want to remain anonymous</p>
<p>in some of their transactions.</p>
<p>I forget where it was</p>
<p>something in the Scandinavian countries.</p>
<p>A lot of alcohol is purchased through cash</p>
<p>because people don&rsquo;t want other people to know</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re purchasing alcohol,</p>
<p>which is cool,</p>
<p>whatever people want.</p>
<p>And so I think</p>
<p>privacy and digitization</p>
<p>are really interlinked,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I think</p>
<p>privacy is such an important element of trust</p>
<p>in what we try to go do.</p>
<p>But I think cash will be around for a long time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Ann] Just not my daughters using it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, I think generations will be very different,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and I also think different parts of the world</p>
<p>will be different,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s clearly reducing</p>
<p>as a percent of all transactions</p>
<p>and will continue to do so.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is my last question before I open it up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Give us a prediction</p>
<p>for a change in the fintech space in 2022.</p>
<p>What are some of the changes we&rsquo;re gonna see?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I think the pandemic</li>
</ul>
<p>clearly accelerated all things digital.</p>
<p>I think previously disparate parts of our economy</p>
<p>are coming together on apps.</p>
<p>I think payments, basic financial services,</p>
<p>budgeting tools, bill payment, high-yield savings,</p>
<p>shopping tools, couponing, rewards,</p>
<p>those were all previously disparate apps</p>
<p>and disparate systems.</p>
<p>I was talking to a person the other day</p>
<p>who used to work</p>
<p>at a company called Afterpay that does buy now pay later.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s now working at Google.</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;Well, why did you leave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he said, &ldquo;&lsquo;Cause I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>buy now pay later is a company.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s part of a service of things going forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tend to agree with that.</p>
<p>I think more and more things are coming together</p>
<p>with brands that are trusted.</p>
<p>People want a common UX across a number of things.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a super app in China terms,</p>
<p>which is very different.</p>
<p>But where things can come together,</p>
<p>you can have a single log on.</p>
<p>You can utilize data and information</p>
<p>to inform other transactions</p>
<p>and make them more seamless</p>
<p>to be able to lend responsibly.</p>
<p>If I know somebody&rsquo;s bill-pay information,</p>
<p>I know whether I can lend responsibly to them.</p>
<p>And that data and information can interact together,</p>
<p>and they can have a better experience.</p>
<p>And so I think you&rsquo;re gonna just see</p>
<p>more and more confluence, different things.</p>
<p>I think the other thing, clearly, you&rsquo;re gonna begin to see;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s this year</p>
<p>but over the next several years;</p>
<p>is a move into digital currencies,</p>
<p>into a different infrastructure.</p>
<p>the infrastructure of the current financial system</p>
<p>is very antiquated.</p>
<p>It takes too long to get to your money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too expensive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not programmable,</p>
<p>and so I think you&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>things like stable coins,</p>
<p>central bank-issued digital currencies,</p>
<p>more and more use of blockchain technology rise,</p>
<p>because I think it adds utility to what we can do</p>
<p>as a financial service industry and for customers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you so much for that.</li>
</ul>
<p>I now am going to call Ray, too, to the podium,</p>
<p>and after Ray&rsquo;s question</p>
<p>if you wanna go stand at the mics.</p>
<p>Do introduce yourselves before you ask your question.</p>
<ul>
<li>All right. Hey, everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks, Dan, for taking the time with the questions,</p>
<p>and thanks the dean and the team</p>
<p>for helping to put on this event.</p>
<p>I think as students,</p>
<p>we have access to tremendous opportunities,</p>
<p>whether we&rsquo;re thinking about going into consulting</p>
<p>or banking, healthcare, or even fintech,</p>
<p>so I have a two-part question,</p>
<p>and the first part is</p>
<p>what would be your pitch for working in your industry.</p>
<p>And then within the industry,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a ton of exciting things going on,</p>
<p>from buy now pay later to crypto,</p>
<p>and so where do you think within the industry</p>
<p>are the best opportunities?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I think I just made my pitch to all of you,</li>
</ul>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not gonna do it again.</p>
<p>No, I think&hellip;</p>
<p>Look, if I were in your shoes or any of your shoes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d look to work</p>
<p>at a company that I could be proud of.</p>
<p>When I was looking for different opportunities myself,</p>
<p>I always tell people&hellip;</p>
<p>And I mentor so many different people,</p>
<p>and they always say, &ldquo;Well, should I take this job or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What are your filters?</p>
<p>What what&rsquo;s important to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My filters at one time in my life</p>
<p>were I wanted to be able to take a job that I was proud of,</p>
<p>that I could talk to my kids about</p>
<p>and say,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad does this,&rdquo;</p>
<p>and they would say, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s cool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t wanna say this out loud,</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause it&rsquo;s probably streaming somewhere,</p>
<p>but I had an opportunity to run a company.</p>
<p>Was a big company, but it wasn&rsquo;t a cool company,</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t something that I thought</p>
<p>was gonna make a difference in the world.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t imagine telling my kids</p>
<p>Dad makes plastic cups or something.</p>
<p>I wanted it to be something that was impactful,</p>
<p>and I think you should think about that yourselves.</p>
<p>What is it that you wanna be proud of?</p>
<p>And number two, and I think this is important,</p>
<p>and I know I don&rsquo;t need to tell you this,</p>
<p>but the values of a company</p>
<p>are extraordinarily important</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause it&rsquo;s very difficult now</p>
<p>for a company not to take a public stand in some way,</p>
<p>and if they don&rsquo;t, it also says something.</p>
<p>And so you should be proud of what the company stands for</p>
<p>and what it does and what its values are.</p>
<p>I would just apply that to everything.</p>
<p>One of my things was location</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause at the time, that seemed to be important to me</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause I had small kids</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t want to take them outta school</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t wanna be someplace</p>
<p>where I couldn&rsquo;t be home for dinner with them,</p>
<p>so location was important.</p>
<p>And who I worked with was really important</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause you don&rsquo;t wanna work with people</p>
<p>that you have to walk on eggshells around,</p>
<p>who are temperamental (laughs),</p>
<p>or to me, it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s not worth it.</p>
<p>Life&rsquo;s too short.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Ray] Awesome, thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you. We don&rsquo;t have much time left.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If we have questions,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you go to the microphone</p>
<p>and introduce yourself?</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sure. Thank you so much, Dan.</li>
</ul>
<p>My name is Amman.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a third-year here at Berkeley.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m studying computer science.</p>
<p>My question for you is of all of the mentors and peers</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve worked with,</p>
<p>who was among the most innovative?</p>
<p>And what qualities or characteristics</p>
<p>made them so forward-thinking?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, hey, Amman. Thanks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Richard Branson clearly was the most innovative.</p>
<p>First of all,</p>
<p>he cannot let a dollar rest in his pocket for a second.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gotta be (laughs) investing it somewhere.</p>
<p>I remember I was doing Virgin Mobile.</p>
<p>It was during</p>
<p>one of the big downturns.</p>
<p>Richard ran a big airline, Virgin Atlantic.</p>
<p>He always joked,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the best way to become a millionaire</p>
<p>running an airline?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to start off as a billionaire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>(Amman laughs)</p>
<p>He really, really believed</p>
<p>that the established companies had a ton of vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>They were looking to maximize profit at consumer expense.</p>
<p>He really looked for how can you be a customer champion.</p>
<p>That has resonated with me from the beginning.</p>
<p>When I went into PayPal, they said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;re a financial services company?</p>
<p>Or a tech company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>and I knew this was a trick question (laughs),</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause all the tech people are gonna be angry</p>
<p>if I said financial services</p>
<p>and all the compliance people are gonna be angry</p>
<p>if I said we&rsquo;re a tech company.</p>
<p>And I said, &ldquo;What I hope we are</p>
<p>is a consumer champion company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And by the way, it&rsquo;s not easy to be a consumer champion.</p>
<p>You have to challenge your own business model.</p>
<p>We used to steer people</p>
<p>to the lowest funding instrument in the PayPal wallet</p>
<p>and then I came up with this idea:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t we give everyone choice?</p>
<p>Whatever you want to use you should use,&rdquo;</p>
<p>and the day I announced it, our stock dropped 15%,</p>
<p>and people were like, &ldquo;Urgh,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re killing the business model,&rdquo;</p>
<p>but of course, what happened is engagement went up.</p>
<p>People were happier.</p>
<p>More people spent more.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t at war with financial institutions anymore,</p>
<p>and that was about being a customer champion.</p>
<p>And Richard I&rsquo;m very close friends with today.</p>
<p>He taught me so much,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m forever grateful to him for that,</p>
<p>so clearly, Richard would be the answer for that.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Amman] Thank you, Dan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, Dan. My name&rsquo;s Ayiv Shtavay.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I study EECS and business</p>
<p>here at Haas and in the engineering school.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big motivational speeches&hellip;</p>
<p>I love that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Steve Harvey has what he talks about</p>
<p>as the turn-back moment in your life,</p>
<p>where the going gets really, really tough,</p>
<p>and at this moment, you can turn back,</p>
<p>but the guarantee&rsquo;s that whatever dream you had</p>
<p>will never happen.</p>
<p>But at that moment, you choose to keep going,</p>
<p>and you succeed.</p>
<p>Did you have a moment like that in your life?</p>
<ul>
<li>We all do.</li>
</ul>
<p>We typically don&rsquo;t like to talk about &rsquo;em, but</p>
<p>mine was clearly the death of my sister.</p>
<p>I was a young,</p>
<p>I guess, rising star at AT&amp;T,</p>
<p>and I, basically,</p>
<p>was very much all about me at the time, very much.</p>
<p>And I was leading a big team</p>
<p>with a project that was reading out to the board of AT&amp;T,</p>
<p>and my sister died.</p>
<p>Oh, it was just unbelievable.</p>
<p>It was like a bomb exploded in my head.</p>
<p>I was so mad at the world,</p>
<p>and I really couldn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>for quite some time.</p>
<p>I came back finally,</p>
<p>and we read out to the board,</p>
<p>and I wasn&rsquo;t sure I even wanted to go back to work,</p>
<p>to tell you the truth.</p>
<p>I really wasn&rsquo;t sure what I wanted to do,</p>
<p>but the one thing I knew for sure</p>
<p>is I hadn&rsquo;t done a damn thing (chuckles) in that project.</p>
<p>It was the team that had done everything,</p>
<p>and I basically said to board,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the messenger, but honestly, I&rsquo;ve been out for months.</p>
<p>This team did everything.</p>
<p>It came together when I wasn&rsquo;t around,</p>
<p>did better than (chuckles) when I was around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For whatever reason,</p>
<p>my career took off after that.</p>
<p>It was this idea of giving other people credit.</p>
<p>I thank my sister for that all the time.</p>
<p>I wish she was still here, and I wish</p>
<p>that I was still the selfish individual</p>
<p>that (chuckles) I was back then,</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause I&rsquo;d do that trade-off anytime.</p>
<p>But she taught me a huge lesson that I&rsquo;ll never forget</p>
<p>and was one of these things</p>
<p>that was that turnaround moment for me.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Ayiv] Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You bet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Ann] I think this will have to be</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>our last question for Dan.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Dan] No pressure, no pressure.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Jack laughs) (Ann laughs)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hey, Dan, thank you for being here.</li>
</ul>
<p>My name is Jack.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a junior transfer here at Cal.</p>
<p>My question is how does being the leader</p>
<p>of a publicly traded company</p>
<p>change how you act.</p>
<p>Obviously, PayPal stocks had a rough go of it</p>
<p>for the past couple months.</p>
<p>Has that changed internal operations at PayPal?</p>
<p>Does that change how you wake up in the morning</p>
<p>and start thinking about PayPal?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just curious if that influences you at all.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I&rsquo;m very, very, very competitive, so</li>
</ul>
<p>probably, it intensifies my competitive spirit,</p>
<p>but I really don&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>My daughter once asked me,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, are you different at the office than you are at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t tickle anybody at the office</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>(Jack laughs)</p>
<p>but besides that, I&rsquo;m pretty much the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think authenticity is a key leadership trait.</p>
<p>My view is there are ups and downs all the time.</p>
<p>In life, like in business,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never ever seen anybody</p>
<p>whose life has been straight up into the right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen any stock go only</p>
<p>straight up and to the right.</p>
<p>You need to be</p>
<p>pretty Zen and even-keeled</p>
<p>when things are going unbelievable,</p>
<p>which they had for seven years.</p>
<p>Last several months have not been great,</p>
<p>but you know what?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re focused. We&rsquo;ll turn it around.</p>
<p>And that sort of understanding</p>
<p>really carries through the entire company.</p>
<p>I look at things in a big-picture point of way.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, PayPal is a great company</p>
<p>operating in a great industry,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll do great things going forward as well.</p>
<p>I really try very hard not to change too much</p>
<p>because I think people know who (chuckles) I am.</p>
<p>I wanna be the same through good times and bad times,</p>
<p>and I think most people wanna see a leader who does that.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Jack] Thank you very much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You betcha.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So let&rsquo;s give a big round of applause</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>to Dan Schulman. (audience applauds)</p>
<p>(Ann claps)</p>
<p>(audience murmurs)</p>
