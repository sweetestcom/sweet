<p>story that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>heavy on my noggin</p>
<p>and i do my makeup at the same time</p>
<p>for the month of</p>
<p>october i thought</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be fun to just sit down and like do</p>
<p>halloween makeup just</p>
<p>kind of i mean</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not really like going</p>
<p>crazy cool i&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re all caught up</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in true</p>
<p>crime and you like makeup i</p>
<p>would highly</p>
<p>suggest you hit that subscribe button so this week i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna talk about peter and</p>
<p>betty fabiano</p>
<p>have you heard of them</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t think so i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t heard</p>
<p>about them either and</p>
<p>i even went on to youtube to see if there&rsquo;s any videos</p>
<p>about it nothing</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s start with</p>
<p>peter fabiano okay</p>
<p>peter was a former</p>
<p>truck driver</p>
<p>and during this time in his life is when he met</p>
<p>a woman named</p>
<p>betty and betty</p>
<p>had two children from a previous</p>
<p>marriage but she was single at this time</p>
<p>and when they met they</p>
<p>just kind of hit it off and they</p>
<p>started dating</p>
<p>and this was in the 1940s</p>
<p>he continued working as a</p>
<p>truck driver</p>
<p>while they got</p>
<p>married and</p>
<p>lived in kingston</p>
<p>new york and then</p>
<p>in 1956 the couple</p>
<p>moved to los angeles the both of them opened up</p>
<p>like two beauty shops hair salons</p>
<p>which is so</p>
<p>random like it&rsquo;s so opposite of a</p>
<p>truck driver</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>peter got to like</p>
<p>opening beauty shops</p>
<p>cause this was his idea but he got there</p>
<p>and his wife</p>
<p>betty helped him</p>
<p>manage these two beauty shops</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if he went to like</p>
<p>school for beauty or what but hey man</p>
<p>follow your dreams</p>
<p>so october 31st 1957</p>
<p>the kids are out halloween</p>
<p>night trick or</p>
<p>treating all the kids are trying to find</p>
<p>where the full size</p>
<p>candy bars at</p>
<p>as the night ended</p>
<p>35 year old</p>
<p>peter fabiano</p>
<p>his wife betty</p>
<p>and teenage stepdaughter&rsquo;s judy</p>
<p>they all decided to call it a night</p>
<p>get ready for bed and they were just all</p>
<p>gonna go go mimis</p>
<p>go to sleep</p>
<p>so they all get</p>
<p>ready for bed</p>
<p>and they go lay down and they turn out the</p>
<p>lights they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to bed</p>
<p>11 pm comes around</p>
<p>and the doorbell rings</p>
<p>betty kind of rolls over and looks at</p>
<p>peter and is like are you</p>
<p>gonna get that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not gonna get that</p>
<p>peter gets up and he&rsquo;s like okay like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll go get the door and</p>
<p>peter&rsquo;s thinking</p>
<p>these must be just late night</p>
<p>trick or treaters</p>
<p>i mean like i&rsquo;ll just get up there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>candy left i&rsquo;ll just give him the leftover</p>
<p>candy not a big deal so</p>
<p>peter gets up grabs the</p>
<p>candy bowl and goes to answer the</p>
<p>front door now</p>
<p>betty&rsquo;s laying in bed and she hears</p>
<p>peter opening up the door</p>
<p>and she hears peter say</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it a little late for this</p>
<p>end quote now betty</p>
<p>heard two other</p>
<p>voices but she didn&rsquo;t recognize them</p>
<p>and she described them as</p>
<p>sounding masculine</p>
<p>but more like men trying to</p>
<p>sound like women</p>
<p>she just thought it was kind</p>
<p>of strange then a few</p>
<p>seconds later</p>
<p>betty just hears a loud</p>
<p>pop i mean it was loud</p>
<p>so betty and her</p>
<p>daughter judy they get up</p>
<p>out of bed and they like they just</p>
<p>hurry to the</p>
<p>front door where</p>
<p>peter was at</p>
<p>now when they run to the</p>
<p>front door they find</p>
<p>peter just laying on his back just inside the</p>
<p>front door there&rsquo;s blood</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not responding they both start</p>
<p>freaking out that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>betty kind of</p>
<p>puts two and two together she&rsquo;s like oh my god</p>
<p>that was a gunshot</p>
<p>so right away</p>
<p>betty goes to the</p>
<p>kitchen she grabs the</p>
<p>phone and she calls 911</p>
<p>now judy the daughter</p>
<p>she just ran</p>
<p>two doors down to her neighbors because her neighbor</p>
<p>was a member of the los angeles police department</p>
<p>so judy just ran over there</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s knocking on the door and the neighbor answers</p>
<p>and judy&rsquo;s telling them what happened she</p>
<p>heard a loud pop her dad is like what seems to be dead</p>
<p>on the floor</p>
<p>this neighbor was just called</p>
<p>lapd and then the police arrived</p>
<p>within minutes</p>
<p>now peter was</p>
<p>taken to a nearby hospital</p>
<p>but sadly he passed away due to</p>
<p>bleeding massive</p>
<p>bleeding from the gunshot</p>
<p>wound so okay</p>
<p>what the f what the f happened</p>
<p>so detectives go to the home</p>
<p>well okay look</p>
<p>first they ask</p>
<p>betty they&rsquo;re trying to ask</p>
<p>betty like what happened do you know somebody that</p>
<p>would want to hurt him</p>
<p>can you tell us anything and</p>
<p>betty is just</p>
<p>really struggling</p>
<p>i mean she just lost her husband she&rsquo;s really upset</p>
<p>and she can&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s not any help</p>
<p>so detectives just go over to the home</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>search the home</p>
<p>or just search</p>
<p>where they found peter</p>
<p>now when they&rsquo;re there</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t find like any</p>
<p>of the shells</p>
<p>spent shells</p>
<p>ammunition shell</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t find any of that but they also</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t find any evidence</p>
<p>like any clues they don&rsquo;t find anything okay</p>
<p>so then they&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>thinking okay well</p>
<p>maybe this was like an attempt</p>
<p>attempted robbery</p>
<p>because what the hell</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t know so they&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t look like the</p>
<p>shooting was a part of</p>
<p>any type of attempted robbery</p>
<p>whenever i need to run to</p>
<p>their drugstore really quick to like grab something</p>
<p>i always seem to wait</p>
<p>until the last minute honestly it&rsquo;s like</p>

<p>so it said like</p>
<p>two days later i think it is</p>
<p>betty is able to obviously she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still grieving but she&rsquo;s able to give some some help</p>
<p>maybe some clues or something i don&rsquo;t know but</p>
<p>betty just tells them that she and</p>
<p>peter they ran</p>
<p>two beauty shops they&rsquo;ve been married since 1955</p>
<p>their shops were very successful</p>
<p>and as far as she could remember</p>
<p>he had no enemies like she couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think of anybody</p>
<p>detectives have nothing</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like okay let&rsquo;s just interview friends and relatives</p>
<p>they gotta figure something out</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>their job but</p>
<p>after interviewing a bunch of</p>
<p>friends and relatives they</p>
<p>just came up with nothing it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>sounded like this</p>
<p>peter guy was a really nice guy like</p>
<p>nobody disliked him he was hard working he</p>
<p>loved his job</p>
<p>he was very nice</p>
<p>very friendly</p>
<p>nobody had anything mean to say about him</p>
<p>suspicious there</p>
<p>are people who are too nice and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>hmm so you&rsquo;re saying nobody dislikes you okay sure</p>
<p>sure peter sure</p>
<p>so they come back to betty</p>
<p>again and they were like</p>
<p>betty betty</p>
<p>betty can you</p>
<p>think of anybody anybody who</p>
<p>would want to harm</p>
<p>peter and betty&rsquo;s like okay okay let me</p>
<p>think let me think</p>
<p>so betty&rsquo;s thinking</p>
<p>thinking okay</p>
<p>and then she comes up with the name</p>
<p>joan rabel we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna call her</p>
<p>joan because i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s rabel or rebel</p>
<p>or yeah names</p>
<p>are hard okay so joan</p>
<p>she was a friend of the family</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>maybe she would want to do something to peter</p>
<p>so police they go and they look</p>
<p>for this joan girl and they&rsquo;re like who the hell is she</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>bring her in</p>
<p>question her what not figure out what her deal is</p>
<p>so they find this joan lady and they</p>
<p>bring her in</p>
<p>they ask her some questions but they</p>
<p>they let her go because there&rsquo;s just no evidence that</p>
<p>points the finger at her</p>
<p>now police just kind</p>
<p>of keep investigating but they don&rsquo;t have any leads now</p>
<p>a month goes by</p>
<p>the police station gets a mysterious phone call</p>
<p>now someone</p>
<p>calls the station they want to remain anonymous</p>
<p>but this person says hey</p>
<p>you gotta go to this rented locker it&rsquo;s in a department</p>
<p>store in downtown la</p>
<p>i believe it&rsquo;s linked</p>
<p>to the murder of peter</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s his name fabiano</p>
<p>i believe it&rsquo;s linked to the murder of</p>
<p>peter fabiano</p>
<p>so because police</p>
<p>really don&rsquo;t have any damn leads or like all</p>
<p>right let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>check out this locker</p>
<p>now it was in a department</p>
<p>store you can like</p>
<p>rent a lock</p>
<p>rent a locker to</p>
<p>store items in</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never heard of that but i</p>
<p>guess it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>thing maybe</p>
<p>it isn&rsquo;t anymore but it was at some</p>
<p>point so that&rsquo;s good okay</p>
<p>so police go down to this locker and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re able to get inside of this rented locker and</p>
<p>guess what they</p>
<p>find inside this locker</p>
<p>they find a gun</p>
<p>now not just any old gun</p>
<p>it was the same gun that was used in the murder of</p>
<p>peter fabiano</p>
<p>we need to figure out who&rsquo;s renting this locker</p>
<p>because they obviously know something</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re responsible for this</p>
<p>right like hello</p>
<p>okay police look up who&rsquo;s renting this locker</p>
<p>and they come up with the name</p>
<p>goldeen pfizer</p>
<p>goldeen huh okay</p>
<p>so who the hell is this</p>
<p>goldeen person so they do some researching on goldeen</p>
<p>and they see</p>
<p>that she was born in illinois to german immigrants</p>
<p>and she moved to los angeles by 1940</p>
<p>she worked as a</p>
<p>secretary i</p>
<p>think she was working in</p>
<p>some kind of lab</p>
<p>as a secretary but regardless</p>
<p>she was working</p>
<p>but the thing was it&rsquo;s like she didn&rsquo;t work with</p>
<p>peter or the family</p>
<p>at all so it&rsquo;s like what did she want with this</p>
<p>they see that she was</p>
<p>married briefly in 1994 but the</p>
<p>marriage didn&rsquo;t work out</p>
<p>it only lasted a couple</p>
<p>months and then they divorced</p>
<p>after her divorce</p>
<p>ended goldeen was</p>
<p>known to date women</p>
<p>which was very</p>
<p>taboo at the time okay</p>
<p>this was in the 50s nope</p>
<p>but goldeen was out here</p>
<p>doing that so because they find this this weapon that</p>
<p>was in a locker in goldeen&rsquo;s</p>
<p>name and it&rsquo;s the same weapon that was used to kill</p>
<p>peter police go and arrest</p>
<p>43 year old goldeen</p>
<p>and then take her in for questioning now goldeen just</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m laughing because golden</p>
<p>golden&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>she just like wasted no time she was under arrest</p>
<p>and within i</p>
<p>guess just a couple minutes she was like okay i did it</p>
<p>it was me you caught me like she didn&rsquo;t even try</p>
<p>which i wish all these cases</p>
<p>would go i&rsquo;d be great</p>
<p>she wasted no time she&rsquo;s like oh you got me</p>
<p>and then she tells police officers</p>
<p>quote it&rsquo;s a relief to get it off my mind</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>so police are like</p>
<p>all right cool we caught the killer so like</p>
<p>why&rsquo;d she do it i don&rsquo;t get it goldin is just ready to</p>
<p>spill the tea</p>
<p>as you kids call it</p>
<p>so golden instantly says</p>
<p>look a friend of mine her name is joan</p>
<p>she told me to do it and police were like what the hell</p>
<p>we already questioned her like she what tell us more</p>
<p>so joan was a former employee of one of</p>
<p>peter fabiano&rsquo;s beauty shops</p>
<p>and goldeen said</p>
<p>joan is the one who talked her into committing the</p>
<p>crime goldeen said that she and joan</p>
<p>they were friends for</p>
<p>for a couple of years</p>
<p>goldeen and joan they plan the murder for three months</p>
<p>which side note</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like three months too long if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>planning a murder for three months maybe you</p>
<p>should just like let it go and move on with your life</p>
<p>you went three months to think about it</p>
<p>and realize that it wasn&rsquo;t worth it like you know</p>
<p>three months you planned it no</p>
<p>no no all that they would talk about was</p>
<p>peter fabiano</p>
<p>i mean joan was just obsessed</p>
<p>with this guy now joan is the one who described</p>
<p>peter as a vile</p>
<p>evil man and he</p>
<p>would just destroy anyone</p>
<p>who was around him anyone who is his friend he just</p>
<p>was a terrible</p>
<p>human being this is what joan told goldeen</p>
<p>so goldeen&rsquo;s hearing this and just like oh my god like</p>
<p>wow he sounds</p>
<p>awful so goldeen</p>
<p>is thinking okay this</p>
<p>peter guy is just</p>
<p>he just ruined joan</p>
<p>and joan&rsquo;s my friend she&rsquo;s been in</p>
<p>front for a long time why</p>
<p>would she lie to me</p>
<p>about this guy</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s painting this</p>
<p>picture that</p>
<p>peter is just</p>
<p>awful and goldeen said that</p>
<p>she just was developing a deep hatred for him so on</p>
<p>october 21st</p>
<p>goldeen purchased a gun</p>
<p>from a shop in pasadena</p>
<p>which is like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not far from</p>
<p>where she was at the town over</p>
<p>goldeen told the guy behind the</p>
<p>counter that she just needed a gun for home</p>
<p>protection so the guy</p>
<p>is able to get her the gun</p>
<p>and then joan is the one who actually pays for the gun</p>
<p>and she also gets two bullets</p>
<p>joan is the one who tells goldeen</p>
<p>just keep this at your house</p>
<p>and then i&rsquo;ll meet up with you on halloween</p>
<p>night goldeen</p>
<p>takes the gun home she keeps it in a safe spot and</p>
<p>waits for halloween night</p>
<p>okay look we&rsquo;ve all been there you</p>
<p>stand in front of your closet</p>

<p>so when halloween</p>
<p>night comes goldeen says that joan came over to the</p>
<p>house she has some blue jeans</p>
<p>khaki jackets hats</p>
<p>eye mask and they decided to put the gun</p>
<p>in a paper bag as if they were</p>
<p>going trick or treating</p>
<p>so they got dressed up</p>
<p>outfits i don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re supposed to be</p>
<p>but okay lame costume</p>
<p>and they drive to</p>
<p>peter&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>so they get to the home at about 9 pm</p>
<p>and they just kind of park a little bit down the street</p>
<p>but not too far</p>
<p>just where they can see the</p>
<p>house and wait for like the</p>
<p>lights to go out so they&rsquo;re just sitting there</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re waiting</p>
<p>and eventually</p>
<p>the lights to the</p>
<p>house go out</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s their cue</p>
<p>so goldeen says okay they both go up to the</p>
<p>house goldeen</p>
<p>rings the doorbell</p>
<p>and nothing happens</p>
<p>so she rings</p>
<p>again or she knocks</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>peter answers the door</p>
<p>and he asks</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it a little late for this</p>
<p>so goldin says she holds up the</p>
<p>paper bag which had the gun in it remember</p>
<p>and then she fires it and it goes off and it hits</p>
<p>peter off and it kills him</p>
<p>so once they shoot</p>
<p>peter they go running off</p>
<p>right and they get back into their car</p>
<p>and then they drive off</p>
<p>so once they get back into the car they</p>
<p>drive off to a lady</p>
<p>named margaret&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>and the reason that they</p>
<p>drove back to this lady&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house is because</p>
<p>they were actually they were borrowing her car</p>
<p>jesus i&rsquo;d be so pissed if i was margaret really</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna use my car to kill somebody</p>
<p>fucking dicks</p>
<p>anyway so they borrowed this car from margaret</p>
<p>so they drive down to margaret&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house cause they&rsquo;re like we</p>
<p>gotta return the car</p>
<p>okay so they&rsquo;re driving back to margaret&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house they get there i</p>
<p>guess at some point</p>
<p>they burn all</p>
<p>their clothes</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s kind of unclear</p>
<p>like if they burn it and then get into the car</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter i</p>
<p>guess but they burn</p>
<p>their clothes at some</p>
<p>point evidence</p>
<p>so that once they drop off the car joan</p>
<p>turns to goldine</p>
<p>and tells her</p>
<p>forget you ever knew me</p>
<p>and then just walks off now goldin</p>
<p>was upset with like by that</p>
<p>that little</p>
<p>comment is like really made goldin just stop</p>
<p>what what do you mean</p>
<p>so who&rsquo;s joe</p>
<p>who is this lady</p>
<p>well why did joan want to kill</p>
<p>peter i mean what was so</p>
<p>wrong so it all</p>
<p>started when</p>
<p>peter hired joan</p>
<p>to work at his</p>
<p>hair salon in los angeles</p>
<p>now joan was a 40 year old a freelance</p>
<p>photographer</p>
<p>she was also a writer i</p>
<p>guess but i</p>
<p>think she was hired for her</p>
<p>photography</p>
<p>skills i&rsquo;m not even sure like</p>
<p>what she was hired for but regardless she was hired</p>
<p>okay she&rsquo;s fucking hired</p>
<p>peter liked her whatever and he</p>
<p>starts to introduce</p>
<p>joan to everybody in the salon</p>
<p>he introduces joan to</p>
<p>betty his wife cause</p>
<p>betty works there as well she comes in</p>
<p>and she helps out from time to time</p>
<p>cool now betty</p>
<p>would quickly become</p>
<p>joan&rsquo;s obsession</p>
<p>so as time goes on</p>
<p>joan becomes really</p>
<p>close with peter and betty</p>
<p>and she just overall was really</p>
<p>enjoying working for peter</p>
<p>and she just really liked when</p>
<p>betty came in and worked as well</p>
<p>at the same time as her</p>
<p>she just liked her</p>
<p>she was like yay betty</p>
<p>yay now the friendship between the two of them fell</p>
<p>apart when betty and</p>
<p>peter they began to have marital problems</p>
<p>so betty thought it</p>
<p>would be best for the two of them to split</p>
<p>and for her to move out of the family home</p>
<p>i guess it was just really bad they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t getting</p>
<p>along i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sure what it was over or anything but they were just</p>
<p>bickering and</p>
<p>betty&rsquo;s like okay i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna move out because i need some</p>
<p>space by myself</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna take my kids don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>and then i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna move out</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fighting and</p>
<p>guess where</p>
<p>betty moves</p>
<p>she ends up moving it with joan</p>
<p>hmm hmm hmm</p>
<p>oh yes oh yes so this is a nineteen</p>
<p>fifty seven now</p>
<p>it was heavily frowned upon</p>
<p>remember to like do anything</p>
<p>to breathe when newspapers reported on this story</p>
<p>they would describe joan and</p>
<p>betty&rsquo;s relationship as</p>
<p>abnormal because the</p>
<p>papers would</p>
<p>never dare dare dare</p>
<p>to use the l word</p>
<p>the l word is</p>
<p>lesbians oh nene</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t use that word</p>
<p>uh huh no such</p>
<p>thing as lesbians</p>
<p>even like when researching</p>
<p>this it&rsquo;s like you can&rsquo;t ever figure out if joan and</p>
<p>betty were like a couple or</p>
<p>they were having</p>
<p>sexual relations or anything not that it&rsquo;s our business</p>
<p>they just were</p>
<p>living together</p>
<p>but i think it&rsquo;s safe</p>
<p>to say that they were</p>
<p>lovers so it was</p>
<p>never confirmed</p>
<p>nor denied if</p>
<p>the two of them were in a relationship but goldeen</p>
<p>said that they were indeed</p>
<p>lovers betty and john</p>
<p>so betty and joan were living together</p>
<p>for for a little bit</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t seem like it was that long some of these</p>
<p>older cases</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to find information on i mean they</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t even say if they&rsquo;re in a relationship or not</p>
<p>the dates are a little confused</p>
<p>yeah so betty</p>
<p>and john are living together for not even that long</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>you know betty just decides that you know what</p>
<p>i miss peter</p>
<p>peter and betty decide</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s work on our marriage</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s try and fix this and be</p>
<p>be together again</p>
<p>peter was like</p>
<p>we can be together</p>
<p>under one condition</p>
<p>you can no longer see joan</p>
<p>so betty&rsquo;s like well shit</p>
<p>thanks joan it&rsquo;s been real</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m out so betty then moves back with</p>
<p>peter as you</p>
<p>maybe are putting the</p>
<p>pieces together like a lifetime movie</p>
<p>but this ain&rsquo;t a lifetime</p>
<p>movie this is real life</p>
<p>joan is hurt</p>
<p>but she is pissed</p>
<p>she is heartbroken</p>
<p>and she became fixated</p>
<p>on removing</p>
<p>the problem</p>
<p>the problem that was preventing her from being with</p>
<p>betty and that problem baby girl</p>
<p>was a man named peter</p>
<p>now when you</p>
<p>break up with somebody somebody</p>
<p>leaves you for another person of course that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>heartbreaking</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really hard and it hurts it hurts really bad</p>
<p>it does i know</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t let yourself go to that</p>
<p>cross that line</p>
<p>to just becoming</p>
<p>a little too</p>
<p>obsessed okay and joan</p>
<p>started to just become</p>
<p>obsessed with betty</p>
<p>and getting her back she was in love with betty</p>
<p>and betty didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what she was missing</p>
<p>because betty</p>
<p>could be treated so much better if she was with joan</p>
<p>i just have to show that to her you know</p>
<p>joan is a little selfish</p>
<p>asshole when</p>
<p>betty moves out</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when joan</p>
<p>is like dude i&rsquo;m lonely</p>
<p>i need somebody</p>
<p>let me call up goldeen</p>
<p>ring ring goldie</p>
<p>nice joan and they became very close</p>
<p>now you see</p>
<p>goldie and joan</p>
<p>again they had</p>
<p>known each other for a couple of years</p>
<p>goldie had like a major</p>
<p>crush on joan</p>
<p>and joan cheat was</p>
<p>aware that golden liked</p>
<p>her but she wasn&rsquo;t really interested in her she wanted</p>
<p>betty she was in love with</p>
<p>betty right</p>
<p>so joan is just feeling lonely and she just</p>
<p>kinda needs somebody</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when she calls up</p>
<p>goldeen and then they</p>
<p>start hanging out and they</p>
<p>start officially dating now the relationship</p>
<p>between the two of them it was moving really fast</p>
<p>but it was becoming more</p>
<p>clear to goldeen</p>
<p>that joan was</p>
<p>clearly not over her previous relationship</p>
<p>so joan would constantly talk</p>
<p>about betty</p>
<p>constantly talk about</p>
<p>how peter was abusive towards</p>
<p>betty and towards the children</p>
<p>joan then would go on to say that</p>
<p>peter was doing drugs he was also</p>
<p>selling drugs out of his</p>
<p>house and that&rsquo;s how he like</p>
<p>had so much</p>
<p>money to run</p>
<p>these businesses convinced</p>
<p>goldeen that</p>
<p>peter was pure evil</p>
<p>now goldeen</p>
<p>had never met</p>
<p>peter or betty</p>
<p>but she just felt so bad</p>
<p>based off of what joan was telling her</p>
<p>and she was like oh my gosh poor</p>
<p>betty she&rsquo;s just really</p>
<p>stuck in this</p>
<p>marriage she&rsquo;s being abused by</p>
<p>this awful man</p>
<p>i just couldn&rsquo;t imagine being in her shoes and</p>
<p>joan just wants to help her</p>
<p>goldie was just</p>
<p>allowing herself to believe</p>
<p>everything that joan was saying</p>
<p>and she then was just</p>
<p>becoming controlled by joan&rsquo;s personal agenda</p>
<p>so when joan brought up the idea that</p>
<p>maybe they should</p>
<p>you know they should</p>
<p>shoot and kill peter</p>
<p>that way he&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>stop abusing people he&rsquo;ll stop abusing his children</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s the only way to get betty free</p>
<p>we have to kill him goldin just followed all of</p>
<p>jones instructions</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t she just</p>
<p>was a sheep</p>
<p>although joan gave goldeen</p>
<p>money to buy the gun</p>
<p>technically goldeen was the one who purchased a gun</p>
<p>and it would be</p>
<p>later traced back to her but it was like</p>
<p>under goldeen&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>also goldeen technically purchased the bullets</p>
<p>and then lastly goldeen</p>
<p>was technically the one</p>
<p>who pulled the trigger</p>
<p>and killed peter</p>
<p>now joan was a</p>
<p>smart little cookie</p>
<p>okay she knew</p>
<p>to have goldeen</p>
<p>put the gun in her name she knew</p>
<p>to have goldeen put the</p>
<p>the bullets in her name she knew</p>
<p>have goldeen</p>
<p>technically</p>
<p>pull the trigger</p>
<p>so if anything came back to them</p>
<p>she could be like</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t me it was all goldeen&rsquo;s idea</p>
<p>joan was smart in that sense</p>
<p>kind of i mean not really but you know</p>
<p>that part was</p>
<p>smart i guess</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>smart and i</p>
<p>would suggest</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t do that so once the murder was done remember</p>
<p>jones says to goldeen</p>
<p>forget you ever knew me and goldeen</p>
<p>that really</p>
<p>stuck with her and it just left her with so much guilt</p>
<p>guilt for killing someone</p>
<p>grief because she was officially</p>
<p>being dumped by joan</p>
<p>and now she was</p>
<p>stuck with the gun goldin was</p>
<p>so they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think of a plan</p>
<p>of what to do like with the</p>
<p>gun or like how to get rid of it or anything like that</p>
<p>or maybe joan just didn&rsquo;t give two shits</p>
<p>to really even</p>
<p>care to get rid of the gun just left it with</p>
<p>goldeen was like</p>
<p>peace out thanks</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s when goldeen rented a</p>
<p>store lockbox and that&rsquo;s why she put the gun in there</p>
<p>it just became very</p>
<p>clear to goldeen</p>
<p>that joan was just</p>
<p>using her that</p>
<p>their relationship wasn&rsquo;t even real</p>
<p>and that john didn&rsquo;t even really love her</p>
<p>goldeen was really hurt by this</p>
<p>do you blame her no</p>
<p>should she have killed somebody</p>
<p>absolutely not</p>
<p>but like i feel bad for her</p>
<p>joan just wanted somebody to do all of her</p>
<p>dirty work and then toss her to the side like trash</p>
<p>all of this</p>
<p>anger sadness</p>
<p>guilt and grief is what led goldeen</p>
<p>to confessing</p>
<p>why would she be</p>
<p>loyal to joan now i mean</p>
<p>joan just threw me aside and was like</p>
<p>thanks i bet you have joan didn&rsquo;t dump goldeen</p>
<p>maybe it would have led to her not doing that</p>
<p>police arrest</p>
<p>joan as well</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if i mentioned that and goldeen</p>
<p>was arrested</p>
<p>and put in jail as well</p>
<p>goldeen pleaded insanity and stated to one of her</p>
<p>psychiatrists</p>
<p>evaluating the case</p>
<p>that she had no motive</p>
<p>and whatever motive she had it was because of joan</p>
<p>she also went on to say that she was</p>
<p>easily influenced</p>
<p>and that she&rsquo;s always been very</p>
<p>impressionable</p>
<p>and trusting</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t sound</p>
<p>like insanity to me just</p>
<p>sounds like a lot of people</p>
<p>goldeen was just looking for a way out goldeen&rsquo;s</p>
<p>psychiatrist</p>
<p>later wrote that</p>
<p>the only thought goldeen</p>
<p>had was that</p>
<p>she had to save her friend joan from an evil person</p>
<p>joan pleaded</p>
<p>innocent okay joan</p>
<p>which no comment by joan</p>
<p>ever ever suspicious but both</p>
<p>women were sentenced to five years to life in prison</p>
<p>after taking a plea</p>
<p>deal to reduce</p>
<p>their charge from</p>
<p>first degree murder to</p>
<p>second degree murder</p>
<p>now their case landed in history as the</p>
<p>trick or treater</p>
<p>murderer and was</p>
<p>frequently cited as</p>
<p>an example of</p>
<p>women receiving softer</p>
<p>treatment in the courtroom</p>
<p>according to the la times goldeen</p>
<p>was eventually</p>
<p>released and remained in the los angeles area</p>
<p>in 1971 she was made an officer of the</p>
<p>miracle mile chapter of the professional</p>
<p>women&rsquo;s club</p>
<p>goldeen died at the</p>
<p>age of 83 in 1998</p>
<p>she seemed to live like a long</p>
<p>happy life she</p>
<p>never like gave any</p>
<p>interviews or anything</p>
<p>like girl come out with a book or something</p>
<p>write a lifetime movie</p>
<p>come on anyways</p>
<p>and then joan</p>
<p>joan was released at some</p>
<p>point and there is little to no</p>
<p>trace of her</p>
<p>after 1957 just</p>
<p>off the grid</p>
<p>nothing there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nothing on her it&rsquo;s just like what the hell</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also been mentioned that possibly joan</p>
<p>changed her name</p>
<p>which would i</p>
<p>guess would make</p>
<p>sense but it was</p>
<p>weird she never said a peep</p>
<p>nothing now</p>
<p>betty went on to live a very full life</p>
<p>and she ended up passing away at the</p>
<p>age of eighty one in nineteen ninety nine</p>
<p>now i know what you&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>thinking did</p>
<p>betty love joan</p>
<p>do the two of them ever reconnect</p>
<p>after peter&rsquo;s murder did</p>
<p>betty play a</p>
<p>role in her husband&rsquo;s murder was it her idea</p>
<p>these are questions we will probably</p>
<p>never get an</p>
<p>answer to actually we were probably most likely 99</p>
<p>never get an answer to</p>
<p>none of them talked and nobody knows nothing</p>
<p>nothing so before we sign off here on</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>final thoughts i have no idea i</p>
<p>think joan was just</p>
<p>truly obsessed with</p>
<p>betty right</p>
<p>but then i was thinking</p>
<p>cause nobody knows if</p>
<p>betty and joan</p>
<p>ended up together after</p>
<p>peter passed away</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t know like do you think</p>
<p>betty was in</p>
<p>on it i don&rsquo;t know i really don&rsquo;t know nothing</p>
<p>pointed to betty</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>think regardless</p>
<p>yes i do think that</p>
<p>their sentence was way too light</p>
<p>they got to live like</p>
<p>happy long lives</p>
<p>so what the</p>
<p>fuck happened to joan i don&rsquo;t know but she did not</p>
<p>deserve to get out of prison</p>
<p>goldie and i kind of felt bad for her</p>
<p>cause i do think she needs to be held</p>
<p>accountable for what she did she got played</p>
<p>you know like that sucks</p>
<p>when you just</p>
<p>like are being used to give</p>
<p>back an ex or whatever i hope you have a good day today</p>
<p>you make good choices</p>
<p>and please please please be safe out there</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get played</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t fall into anybody&rsquo;s little trap</p>
<p>okay if somebody tells you to kill someone you say</p>
<p>no god damn it that&rsquo;s not okay</p>
<p>anyways have a good day</p>
<p>make good choices and i&rsquo;ll be seeing you guys later bye</p>
