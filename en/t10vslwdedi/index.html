<p>anything just take it with a grain of</p>
<p>salt do your own research check with</p>
<p>your doctor before implementing anything</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s just Dive Right In there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of questions so let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s see how</p>
<p>many we can answer today all right that</p>
<p>sounds great and we&rsquo;re going to start</p>
<p>with Isaac now he&rsquo;s had a lot of trouble</p>
<p>coming on the ear so let&rsquo;s see if we can</p>
<p>hear him Isaac you are on with Dr Berg</p>
<p>if uh we can hear you try go ahead with</p>
<p>your question</p>
<p>unfortunately Isaac we can&rsquo;t hear you so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to kind of put you back on</p>
<p>hold for no not yet oh there we go okay</p>
<p>yes there we go wonderful go ahead with</p>
<p>your question for Dr Berg Isaac</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t hear you hear me go ahead</p>
<p>yeah let me know yes go ahead hi okay hi</p>
<p>doctor yes did you hear me</p>
<p>yes go ahead with your question hello</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>correlated</p>
<p>okay hi Dr Burke hi there go ahead with</p>
<p>your question Isaac we can hear you</p>
<p>okay you hear me now yes</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>okay I am diagnosed with ulcerated for</p>
<p>lifeless for a long time and I&rsquo;m taking</p>
<p>medicine at this time I&rsquo;m in Humira for</p>
<p>a long time like for since 2017.</p>
<p>now more than six years</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to stop this medicine</p>
<p>because of the side effects and as you</p>
<p>mentioned one time one of the</p>
<p>hello medicine</p>
<p>you may</p>
<p>I tell you okay I think I have enough</p>
<p>information</p>
<p>yeah let me um yeah I cut off his volume</p>
<p>go ahead doc</p>
<p>so um there&rsquo;s many different causes of</p>
<p>inflammation especially in your gut</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>and so what uh what you have to do is</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>um look at the potential causes and I</p>
<p>think the number one cause is you have</p>
<p>to relate it to the diet there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something you&rsquo;re eating obviously that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>irritating the gut</p>
<p>um and unfortunately when you take</p>
<p>medication you&rsquo;re treating the symptom</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re you got to remove the reason</p>
<p>for it and typically it&rsquo;s things that</p>
<p>irritate the colon it could be something</p>
<p>related to</p>
<p>either gluten is a big one</p>
<p>uh and the grains Okay that&rsquo;s a big one</p>
<p>it could be an allergy to something with</p>
<p>dairy but that&rsquo;s less common it could be</p>
<p>some other allergy like uh peanuts or</p>
<p>something like that but typically it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the grains and which is the most common</p>
<p>thing that people irritate the colon so</p>
<p>you must remove those uh on some cases</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s something in the vegetable that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating like it could be um some</p>
<p>oxlets were lectins or something in</p>
<p>there that is an anti-nutrient that</p>
<p>could be irritating you so and this is</p>
<p>why when someone has inflammation in the</p>
<p>gut they&rsquo;re going to be doing very well</p>
<p>if they cut out beans legumes nuts and</p>
<p>even some plants for a while and</p>
<p>especially grains</p>
<p>and then start eating um more animal</p>
<p>protein what&rsquo;s interesting one of the</p>
<p>best ways to heal the gut and this might</p>
<p>surprise everyone is beef</p>
<p>beef that&rsquo;s right because beef has the</p>
<p>most glutamine and glutamine is one of</p>
<p>the best foods for the colon cells and</p>
<p>rarely does anyone have an allergy to</p>
<p>beef now you can do lamb you can do</p>
<p>other things but that seems to be a good</p>
<p>healer for the gut and it doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>any anti-nutrients and of course I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to recommend like the grass-fed</p>
<p>things like that too</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m going to be releasing a video on</p>
<p>some new information about inflammation</p>
<p>but I I honestly for you it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>mirror mirror changing of the diet do</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>um get off these other things and watch</p>
<p>what happens you&rsquo;re going to be quite</p>
<p>pleasantly surprised with your gut</p>
<p>inflammation</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s great Isaac thanks for being</p>
<p>such a great Sport and battling the uh</p>
<p>cell towers and getting your question</p>
<p>across and so we appreciate you coming</p>
<p>on with us and with that Isaac stay</p>
<p>tuned because we&rsquo;re having our first</p>
<p>quiz question of the day this one&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>true false or doc</p>
<p>okay when you are in a state of panic</p>
<p>okay like a panic attack where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>hyperventilating uh this means that you</p>
<p>need more air is that true or false</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know all right audience climb</p>
<p>onto that that was my comic relief for</p>
<p>the first five minutes of the show and</p>
<p>then let&rsquo;s go immediately to social</p>
<p>media who&rsquo;s been so patient uh and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>start with Joanna from YouTube I&rsquo;m on</p>
<p>healthy keto and not diabetic do I need</p>
<p>to monitor myself for ketoacidosis</p>
<p>ketoacidosis is a state where your</p>
<p>ketones are way too high like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like above 10 okay now realize that</p>
<p>anyone does this that&rsquo;s not a diabetic</p>
<p>okay is never ever going to rise above</p>
<p>probably even five</p>
<p>uh but it uses between 0.5 and 3 for</p>
<p>most people unless you start doing</p>
<p>prolonged fasting and a lot of exercise</p>
<p>so um do you have to worry about that um</p>
<p>no you don&rsquo;t have to worry about that</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re a type 1 diabetic and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re forgetting to use your insulin</p>
<p>okay you&rsquo;re not regulating the blood</p>
<p>sugars and then that would be uh the</p>
<p>risk factor now there are some other</p>
<p>rare rare examples if someone is a</p>
<p>diabetic and they&rsquo;re pregnant that could</p>
<p>be an issue or they&rsquo;re taking medication</p>
<p>or they have some rare disease but those</p>
<p>are all so so rare but typically all you</p>
<p>have to do</p>
<p>is get a glucose a blood glucose slash</p>
<p>Ketone meter</p>
<p>and measure where you&rsquo;re at and I will</p>
<p>pretty much guarantee that you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to probably get above three or</p>
<p>four and at the very most five</p>
<p>all right Joanna ketoacidosis is like 10</p>
<p>11 12 uh that type of thing all right</p>
<p>good news Joanna so it looks like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in the clear and uh let&rsquo;s see we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>an answer for quiz question number one</p>
<p>and it asks true false when you are in a</p>
<p>state of panic and hyperventilation this</p>
<p>means you actually need more air well 85</p>
<p>percent of our respondents say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>false and 15 say I need more air it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>true</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;ll try to try to get more air</p>
<p>try to breathe more and see what happens</p>
<p>um when you&rsquo;re trying to get more air</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re hyperventilating you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting the wrong ratio of oxygen</p>
<p>to CO2 it&rsquo;s not just the oxygen in the</p>
<p>air you have nitrogen you have CO2 in</p>
<p>the air and so if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get enough CO2</p>
<p>what happens is that oxygen is not able</p>
<p>to be released inside your cells this is</p>
<p>why when people are in a panic attack</p>
<p>they breathe in a paper bag</p>
<p>so they can get less oxygen and more CO2</p>
<p>and finally start to calm down their</p>
<p>asthma attack or whatever they&rsquo;re into</p>
<p>so very simply if you&rsquo;re in a panic</p>
<p>attack or you have anxiety and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stressed right before sleep and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to sleep</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably noticing you&rsquo;re either</p>
<p>holding your breath or there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>breath problem so you just need to slow</p>
<p>down the breath have even</p>
<p>breaths in and breathing breaths out and</p>
<p>breathe through your nose and that&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>increase the CO2</p>
<p>and then allow the oxygen</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called the bore effect it can go</p>
<p>right into the cells and you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>actually start breathing you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>your Panic will go away and you&rsquo;ll feel</p>
<p>much better so I&rsquo;m gonna in this next</p>
<p>week release a video on this very</p>
<p>powerful breathing technique because it</p>
<p>can pull you out of a lot of stress</p>
<p>States</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s wonderful good news look forward</p>
<p>to that video and look forward to saying</p>

<p>listen I think my eyes are now crosstalk</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have to put a video out about</p>
<p>that from pushing the screen too far</p>
<p>away I&rsquo;m up in Dr Berg&rsquo;s area up in the</p>
<p>Washington DC area today visiting a a</p>
<p>different place so that&rsquo;s my setup&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little different but still love being a</p>
<p>part of everything and thank you from</p>
<p>folks all around the world for joining</p>
<p>us today let&rsquo;s go back to social media</p>
<p>Jerry from Facebook what&rsquo;s the most</p>
<p>powerful remedy to treat E coli</p>
<p>again you know I I don&rsquo;t treat disease</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to just give you some</p>
<p>recommendations to to re to research so</p>
<p>you could actually help your stuff</p>
<p>um you know there&rsquo;s several and natural</p>
<p>anti-microbial herbs out there</p>
<p>um garlic is one onion is two and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also thyme sage</p>
<p>and even like you can get an herbal</p>
<p>remedy as the black walnut Hall</p>
<p>clove these are all really good</p>
<p>anti-microbials any of the microbes and</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t seem to harm your own</p>
<p>microbes so that&rsquo;s something that you</p>
<p>can definitely use to help balance out</p>
<p>this E coli situation you have to also</p>
<p>realize that in your body you have</p>
<p>a lot of what&rsquo;s called you know</p>
<p>so-called pathogens in a kind of a</p>
<p>friendly</p>
<p>relationship they&rsquo;re not bothering you</p>
<p>like even candida you have different</p>
<p>funguses that once the environment</p>
<p>changes in your gut that relationship</p>
<p>changes and now they&rsquo;re become</p>
<p>pathogenic</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s even E coli that&rsquo;s in our</p>
<p>bodies that are not creating problems</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s when the relationship changes when</p>
<p>you maybe end take an antibiotic or you</p>
<p>have eat the wrong Foods so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the key is keeping that gut microbe</p>
<p>Flora enhanced and consuming the right</p>
<p>food so you can have the defense and to</p>
<p>keep those relationships really balanced</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t have an over</p>
<p>over a growth of the pathogenic version</p>
<p>all right Folks by the way our producer</p>
<p>Terry because we&rsquo;ve got a little late</p>
<p>start wants to make sure that the</p>
<p>audience gets their money&rsquo;s worth so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll go ahead and stay on the air dock</p>
<p>for an extra three or four minutes if</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s okay with you because we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to miss one extra second of time</p>
<p>serving all of our viewers from around</p>
<p>the world let&rsquo;s go back to social media</p>
<p>once again uh</p>
<p>I said that terribly wrong</p>
<p>sativa excuse me from YouTube have you</p>
<p>created any videos that address Eating</p>
<p>Disorders I struggle to stay on healthy</p>
<p>keto and could use some healthy tips to</p>
<p>stay consistent helpful tips</p>
<p>I think the best thing when you try to</p>
<p>find the video from from now on I would</p>
<p>search Dr Berg in the video because I do</p>
<p>have a few videos on that topic uh I</p>
<p>think the the most important thing to do</p>
<p>is to try to match the healthy version</p>
<p>of Keto as much as you can because that</p>
<p>way you get the nutrients to help</p>
<p>balance any type of</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s any physical issue that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>relating to that number one and then</p>
<p>number two keep your carbs lower that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be very important to</p>
<p>just to help balance your Chemistry</p>
<p>because when the carbs go high all sorts</p>
<p>of things go out of whack there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>couple other things I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>recommend a very high quality probiotic</p>
<p>which will really help vitamin D and</p>
<p>higher amounts and especially a natural</p>
<p>B vitamin B1 okay all of that together I</p>
<p>think will assist you in gaining more</p>
<p>control over that condition</p>
<p>as far as intermittent fasting I</p>
<p>probably wouldn&rsquo;t recommend too much of</p>
<p>that but I also on the flip side</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t recommend adding more snacks so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you just do three meals super</p>
<p>healthy and no snacks</p>
<p>um in between</p>
<p>like most people and I think that would</p>
<p>be the best bet for what you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>through</p>
<p>let me check off my snacks now so gotta</p>
<p>get rid of the tent snacks and get back</p>
<p>on it all right so uh Anyway by the way</p>
<p>folks we really enjoyed coming to you on</p>
<p>YouTube and Facebook but we&rsquo;ve had a few</p>
<p>concerns with YouTube lately but want to</p>
<p>assure you that uh you know you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to lose this there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>other venues and we intend to continue</p>
<p>here on YouTube uh but just in case we</p>
<p>would love for you to go to drburg.com</p>
<p>and make sure that you register is that</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s called you know give us your</p>
<p>email there&rsquo;s a little spot for that</p>
<p>what does that look like Doc on the</p>
<p>website we have I do I do a newsletter</p>
<p>and that way if you actually go to Dr</p>
<p>byrd.com and you sign up you&rsquo;ll at least</p>
<p>um get these a lot of information that</p>
<p>may not be on YouTube or maybe filtered</p>
<p>so you can get more data and I would I</p>
<p>would recommend that because</p>
<p>um we&rsquo;re also going to include a um</p>
<p>another live q a on on that in that</p>
<p>platform so that way it&rsquo;s like not on</p>
<p>YouTube because it&rsquo;s becoming more</p>
<p>difficult to get the information because</p>
<p>some of the information is filtered now</p>
<p>unfortunately but um</p>
<p>that way there&rsquo;s other ways to find the</p>
<p>information that you need and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great so uh if you will maybe take a few</p>
<p>minutes right now to log on to</p>
<p>drberg.com and sign up for the</p>
<p>newsletter and we will never lose track</p>
<p>of you and always feed you um all the</p>
<p>great things that come from Dr Berg and</p>
<p>his crew uh let&rsquo;s go to quiz question</p>
<p>number two and this is not a true falser</p>
<p>and there it is Doc</p>
<p>okay the food that has the highest</p>
<p>amount of vitamin A is fill in the blank</p>
<p>all right yeah this is an actual essay</p>
<p>question you have to write something</p>
<p>down and there&rsquo;s so good luck with that</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um GA from Facebook what&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>remedy to address stiffness in the legs</p>
<p>stiff legs</p>
<p>you know I think there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>reasons for that</p>
<p>um what comes to mind is you might have</p>
<p>an imbalance of calcium and phosphorus</p>
<p>and if there&rsquo;s too much calcium in the</p>
<p>body and not enough phosphorus you you</p>
<p>will tend to get stiff one remedy that I</p>
<p>used to use for that when I use standard</p>
<p>processed products is fast food liquid</p>
<p>you put a little that in some water and</p>
<p>it seems to really help kind of balance</p>
<p>out these calcium buildup also vitamin</p>
<p>K2 is also important removing the</p>
<p>calcium from the joints</p>
<p>um and keeping them in the bone and that</p>
<p>usually comes from you know different</p>
<p>cheeses that you would eat</p>
<p>um Munster cheese happens to have the</p>
<p>most but also you can get it from</p>
<p>sauerkraut as well and uh but other fats</p>
<p>fatty foods even chicken egg yolks you</p>
<p>can get it from Pate liver things like</p>
<p>that all the fatty things except for</p>
<p>fermented things you can also get</p>
<p>vitamin K2 which will help that</p>
<p>stiffness</p>
<p>all right well that&rsquo;s wonderful Laura</p>
<p>from Facebook this is not wonderful what</p>
<p>recommendations would you offer to</p>
<p>someone that has lyme disease that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>real bummer isn&rsquo;t it or can be I did a</p>
<p>video on that I I had it um and I did</p>
<p>the natural version and uh it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>nasty nasty thing but you definitely</p>
<p>need to</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>read a more detailed book about it and</p>
<p>also videos because there&rsquo;s a certain</p>
<p>protocol that you can use certain herbs</p>
<p>that you have to go gradually up because</p>
<p>you can actually start creating die off</p>
<p>when you can feel kind of like like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re detoxing too much but you use</p>
<p>things like colloidal silver you use</p>
<p>things like garlic black walnut and that</p>
<p>way you can um</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>some people have worse effects than</p>
<p>others and so it really boils down to</p>
<p>how strong your immune system is and and</p>
<p>have you been building up your health</p>
<p>Reserve or not</p>
<p>um and so whether you have lime or not I</p>
<p>guess a good tip would be to always</p>
<p>work on building up your health and</p>
<p>fitness to the point where you can</p>
<p>tolerate more stress you can handle</p>
<p>infections when you get them and you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t fall apart because if you&rsquo;re more</p>
<p>fragile boy when things hit you they can</p>
<p>really hit you hard so</p>
<p>stay tuned for more of that you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like every in every moment</p>
<p>of time you have each person that are at</p>
<p>a certain level of health and you really</p>
<p>have to</p>
<p>acknowledge where you&rsquo;re at because</p>
<p>sometimes people think that they&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>lot healthier than they really are and</p>
<p>so they they go off the program so the</p>
<p>more Health Reserve you have the more</p>
<p>flexible you are to eat things that are</p>
<p>off the program</p>
<p>but not everyone has that luxury</p>
<p>interesting well guess what I just</p>
<p>caught Zinedine from Ontario yawning so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to put him on the spot right</p>
<p>now and if you would unmute yourself and</p>
<p>now he&rsquo;s smiling he&rsquo;s very alert and he</p>
<p>is going to ask you one question and</p>
<p>belt it out in 30 seconds yawn or not go</p>
<p>ahead Senate Dean you&rsquo;re on the air with</p>
<p>Dr Berg</p>
<p>so uh thank you for uh for tr3 for the</p>
<p>audience if you I&rsquo;m a big fan and uh I</p>
<p>have a question a year ago uh she had a</p>
<p>Bruce Canon done after the</p>
<p>after that he starts having a headache</p>
<p>and cluster migraine she felt a lot of</p>
<p>pressure mainly on the right side the</p>
<p>doctor she went to prescript her</p>
<p>steroids and anti-dispersion pills she</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t take it instead of what she can do</p>
<p>to take it instead of</p>
<p>those medications daily</p>
<p>so you said one thing at the very</p>
<p>beginning that I missed what was the</p>
<p>first thing you said</p>
<p>oh root canal okay so the headache</p>
<p>started after that</p>
<p>yeah after that yeah okay so I this is</p>
<p>very interesting question because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two possibilities one</p>
<p>is that um many of these root canals</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t actually solve all the problems</p>
<p>there could still be an infection in the</p>
<p>gums so you want to find a really good</p>
<p>doctor that specializes in root canals</p>
<p>and um they may need to</p>
<p>drill out</p>
<p>um because there could be another</p>
<p>abscess or something deep underneath</p>
<p>there that they need to clean out</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a lot of people who had</p>
<p>root canals that end up kind of getting</p>
<p>some contamination of bacteria</p>
<p>underneath there and it&rsquo;s trapped and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s building up pressure and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>referring pain in your head</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s kind of like and they can do a</p>
<p>simple x-ray to look at the bone because</p>
<p>sometimes the these uh this infection</p>
<p>can actually just destroy your bone</p>
<p>right underneath that area that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>first thing I would look at look at and</p>
<p>they might have to go in there and clean</p>
<p>it out or pull the tooth second thing is</p>
<p>this when you get dental work if the</p>
<p>teeth don&rsquo;t fit right</p>
<p>boy that can create all sorts of tension</p>
<p>in your neck and cause a headache so you</p>
<p>go back to the dentist and have them</p>
<p>adjust the teeth bite and when they bite</p>
<p>down is there certain parts of your</p>
<p>tooth that are not fitting exactly right</p>
<p>so why that can create problems all over</p>
<p>your body those would be the two things</p>
<p>I think</p>
<p>you would be very fruitful in figuring</p>
<p>out</p>
<p>thank you so much you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great well that&rsquo;s rotten I hope</p>
<p>your wife feels better and they get to</p>
<p>the bottom of that you know tooth or</p>
<p>whatever it is all right let&rsquo;s go back</p>
<p>to our quiz question uh number two which</p>
<p>required a written answer and it asks</p>
<p>the food that has the highest amount of</p>
<p>vitamin A</p>
<p>is uh 64 percent of our respondents say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s beef liver 16 say it&rsquo;s eggs those</p>
<p>are great ten percent say carrots ten</p>
<p>percent say leafy greens do we have any</p>
<p>Winters among the responses we do have</p>
<p>some winners it is beef liver number one</p>
<p>um and number two would be more like a</p>
<p>cod liver and plus the cod liver oil</p>
<p>number three would be the egg yolk</p>
<p>all right very good great job uh to all</p>
<p>you folks there let&rsquo;s go back to social</p>
<p>media again Alexandra from YouTube uh</p>
<p>what are your thoughts on taking NM in</p>
<p>supplements I&rsquo;ve been taking them for a</p>
<p>while and see an improvement in my white</p>
<p>blood cell count is there a connection</p>
<p>in m in supplements did I does that make</p>
<p>sense and and yeah</p>
<p>um yes that&rsquo;s a really good powerful</p>
<p>compound for your mitochondria</p>
<p>and um without getting into too too much</p>
<p>technicality without you would</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re gonna you&rsquo;re gonna probably</p>
<p>notice two things one is that your</p>
<p>energy is going to go up because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good for the mitochondria and number two</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have less oxidative stress</p>
<p>because it really acts as a very</p>
<p>powerful antioxidant so</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;ll just feel probably less</p>
<p>inflammation in the body and as we age</p>
<p>um that becomes more relevant so</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what I would that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good supplement there&rsquo;s several of those</p>
<p>compounds that are good for the</p>
<p>mitochondria another one would be called</p>
<p>ubiquinol which is a type of um coenzyme</p>
<p>Q10 that you can take which is also good</p>
<p>for the mitochondria and especially if</p>
<p>someone is on a Statin drug</p>
<p>all right very good now I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>race against the clock I&rsquo;m putting up</p>
<p>quiz question number three because our</p>
<p>mean producer Terry always reminds me</p>
<p>well guess what Terry I got ahead of you</p>
<p>on this one and there it is Doc a true</p>
<p>falser</p>
<p>true or false some more regular</p>
<p>inconsistent your heartbeat is</p>
<p>the healthier it is</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re talking about this really</p>
<p>regular heartbeat and talking about the</p>
<p>distance between the heart and</p>
<p>everything as if it&rsquo;s the more regular</p>
<p>it is the healthier it is that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting all right let&rsquo;s see Tony</p>
<p>from Facebook what&rsquo;s the best food and</p>
<p>supplements to address a fatso liver a</p>
<p>fatty liver</p>
<p>well the best supplement is choline</p>
<p>um that is an egg yolks by the way and</p>
<p>if you get on the healthy version of a</p>
<p>keto where you&rsquo;re lowering your carb and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having a lot of vegetables uh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also probably a very good thing</p>
<p>to do to remove fat off your liver</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one study that I posted in a</p>
<p>video that you can literally remove like</p>
<p>almost 50 percent of that fat within two</p>
<p>weeks by going on a low carb diet so um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the secret</p>
<p>all right very good and then our</p>
<p>producer Terry went ahead and sent me</p>
<p>quiz uh quiz time for number three or</p>
<p>quiz number three time just to ignore me</p>
<p>thanks but I beat you to it that way</p>
<p>anyway okay back to social media let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see how about</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Eating Disorders I think we did that</p>
<p>Andrew from Facebook please address</p>
<p>remedies for sleep apnea a lot of people</p>
<p>have that issue</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;ll have to do another video</p>
<p>but I do if you type Dr Burke sleep</p>
<p>apnea you&rsquo;ll find a bunch of things</p>
<p>um usually the way to solve sleep apnea</p>
<p>is just to fix insulin resistance by</p>
<p>going on a low carb healthy Keto Plan</p>
<p>with intermittent fasting okay so that</p>
<p>usually handles it but there are some</p>
<p>other things that can greatly help that</p>
<p>condition as well</p>
<p>because we also have another</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>hormone called cortisol and cortisol if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too high from stress can really</p>
<p>create sleep apnea as well</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um how do you lower cortisol</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s many things that a great</p>
<p>breathing technique exercise eating</p>
<p>healthily removing stress are all very</p>
<p>very key but um that&rsquo;s my quick version</p>
<p>and if you want the long version you can</p>
<p>just search it out on one of my YouTube</p>
<p>videos</p>
<p>all right here&rsquo;s our Lightning Fast</p>
<p>audience already attacked the true false</p>
<p>or number three question which said true</p>
<p>false the more regular and consistent</p>
<p>your heartbeat is the healthier it is</p>
<p>that is a fascinating question and</p>
<p>eighty percent of our respondents excuse</p>
<p>me sixty percent of our respondents say</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s false and forty percent say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true so kind of a split there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s false it&rsquo;s false it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>counterintuitive you would think that a</p>
<p>healthy heart would be very very</p>
<p>consistently regular but it&rsquo;s not a very</p>
<p>healthy heart rate is varied and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking about the distance between the</p>
<p>heartbeats and it&rsquo;s very hard to even</p>
<p>visualize that because sometimes it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in milliseconds so when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking at the heart rate the</p>
<p>variability</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re looking at um how resilient</p>
<p>that heart is that nervous system behind</p>
<p>the heart basically the autonomic</p>
<p>nervous system to how flexible it is to</p>
<p>adapt to stress and recover from stress</p>
<p>and very soon I will have a device that</p>
<p>you can get which is unbelievable</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll allow you to do your own</p>
<p>research on your own body and see where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re at and then do exercise and do</p>
<p>things to see what&rsquo;s going to improve it</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re looking at this exact</p>
<p>technology heart rate variability</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s over 2000 studies on this one</p>
<p>topic it&rsquo;s very backed up by research</p>
<p>but a healthy heart is a varied heart</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>and so anyway stay tuned for that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>pretty excited about that but</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ll create a bunch of videos on how</p>
<p>to simplify it in</p>
<p>help you understand it very simply</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very valuable all right</p>
<p>well I think I I&rsquo;m going to guess what</p>
<p>you might say to Melissa from YouTube if</p>
<p>she says can a person be allergic to</p>
<p>apples even peeled organic apples I get</p>
<p>horrible hiccups whenever I swallow even</p>
<p>a piece help</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not an allergy the true allergy</p>
<p>comes from a</p>
<p>um a protein</p>
<p>but it could be a sensitivity it could</p>
<p>be an intolerance it could also be that</p>
<p>um your digestive system is doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really like to digest apples and fruits</p>
<p>like some people will eat like an apple</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll feel just all this like</p>
<p>bloating</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re introducing</p>
<p>uh something that your microbes aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>used to and there&rsquo;s a lot of fructose in</p>
<p>there as well so</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s not an allergy but it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>an intolerance so I would just avoid</p>
<p>apples right now</p>
<p>all right very good well we&rsquo;ve had a</p>
<p>bunch of boys on the show now let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>to the lovely Victoria who is from</p>
<p>Florida and make sure you unmute</p>
<p>yourself and Victoria is going to</p>
<p>demonstrate how to ask a question her</p>
<p>single question in 30 seconds go</p>
<p>good morning my question</p>
<p>for someone who hasn&rsquo;t been able to</p>
<p>recover after surgery</p>
<p>because they are struggling with issues</p>
<p>like hormonal imbalances and low stomach</p>
<p>accelerate the wound healing</p>
<p>so so you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re trying to increase</p>
<p>the wound healing but you you have a</p>
<p>couple other barriers and and those were</p>
<p>what again</p>
<p>hormonal imbalances</p>
<p>like the thyroid and low stomach acid</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>yeah I think that&rsquo;s a really good</p>
<p>question because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s some very specific things to</p>
<p>increase wound healing</p>
<p>and one big one is the zinc the zinc as</p>
<p>a supplement is one of the best ways to</p>
<p>increase wound healing and uh the other</p>
<p>one is the tocotrinos which is a type of</p>
<p>vitamin E the tocotrinos very very</p>
<p>powerful and</p>
<p>those are the two I would focus on but</p>
<p>make sure that you get on the healthy</p>
<p>version of Keto because that should help</p>
<p>your thyroid uh that should help your</p>
<p>hormones</p>
<p>and put you in a much better place but</p>
<p>uh yeah</p>
<p>um if we&rsquo;re talking about wound healing</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about also</p>
<p>um glutamine is a good amino acid too</p>
<p>for for increasing that as well you can</p>
<p>take that as a supplement but yeah zinc</p>
<p>glutamine and and vitamin E in the form</p>
<p>of tocotrenals and of course if you need</p>
<p>more stomach acid you should take</p>
<p>betaine hydrochloride</p>
<p>perfect thank you so much you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great thanks for hanging in there</p>
<p>with us Victoria uh and asking a great</p>
<p>question and uh get back with us and let</p>
<p>us know how your healing is going and</p>
<p>your hormones and all that stuff all</p>
<p>right let&rsquo;s go back to</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Steve with YouTube</p>
<p>I do two meals a day and have lost 62</p>
<p>pounds I don&rsquo;t have my bell with me</p>
<p>buddy but congratulations 62 pounds in</p>
<p>seven months but now I don&rsquo;t have uh as</p>
<p>much as much fat patting around my</p>
<p>shoulder joints and I&rsquo;m not in pain but</p>
<p>I can hear them rubbing as I&rsquo;m moving</p>
<p>around thoughts his shoulders bones I</p>
<p>guess are crunching away or something</p>
<p>I would work on not increasing fat</p>
<p>around that area I&rsquo;d work on increasing</p>
<p>muscle and that will solve your problem</p>
<p>and so start doing the shoulder</p>
<p>exercises they have a really uh these</p>
<p>great workout for that they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>clubs and they&rsquo;re heavy they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>they have them in five pound ten pound</p>
<p>fifteen pound even 20 pound clubs and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole exercise routine I</p>
<p>bought them I like it because you can um</p>
<p>do a lot of safe motions to start to</p>
<p>strengthen the shoulder muscle itself</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>and even hanging from like a a pull-up</p>
<p>bar very therapeutic for increasing that</p>
<p>little space between the AC joint and um</p>
<p>helping stretch the opposite muscles but</p>
<p>yeah you want to work on building up the</p>
<p>shoulder muscles through</p>
<p>those type of exercises very good here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>quiz question number four doc</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>what is it about exercise that helps</p>
<p>extend your lifespan</p>
<p>All Right audience that&rsquo;s a hopeful</p>
<p>question so go jog around and give us</p>
<p>your answer Mike from YouTube what do</p>
<p>you think about a possible link between</p>
<p>Cancer and parasites</p>
<p>there is a link there there&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>a link there same thing with virus and</p>
<p>cancer I think it really has to do</p>
<p>um also with your immune system</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two different immune cells</p>
<p>that crossover or they kill cancer and</p>
<p>they kill viruses and microbes</p>
<p>so it could be</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening is the immune system is</p>
<p>somehow blocked and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you may have</p>
<p>you may have um</p>
<p>kind of more susceptibility</p>
<p>to getting cancer especially with the</p>
<p>mitochondria but but typically what</p>
<p>causes cancer is damage to the</p>
<p>mitochondria and that could be from</p>
<p>anything chronic anything chronic</p>
<p>inflammation chronic stress chronic bad</p>
<p>eating chronic pollution chronic smoking</p>
<p>chronic eating junk food all these</p>
<p>things build up and so and even chronic</p>
<p>stress as well so</p>
<p>um again here&rsquo;s my suggestion don&rsquo;t wait</p>
<p>till you have cancer work on your health</p>
<p>right now build up a health reserve and</p>
<p>not just um from foods but other things</p>
<p>too by working on your exercise for</p>
<p>example and increasing your Fitness to</p>
<p>keep</p>
<p>beefing up no pun intended that Health</p>
<p>Reserve so you&rsquo;re actually have extra</p>
<p>Fitness</p>
<p>so you can go through life with uh with</p>
<p>uh Less Problems</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s quite interesting with exercise</p>
<p>because well let me just wait for</p>
<p>everyone to answer that before I get</p>
<p>into it too much all right very good in</p>
<p>the meantime simply natural from YouTube</p>
<p>what would you recommend for chronic</p>
<p>pain from lupus that&rsquo;s a nasty condition</p>
<p>best thing is the vitamin D on high</p>
<p>levels so I would take about 50 000 IUS</p>
<p>of vitamin D3</p>
<p>um as a natural anti-inflammatory for</p>
<p>any type of autoimmune problems</p>
<p>I have videos on autoimmune you can</p>
<p>check out but you&rsquo;d have to type Dr Berg</p>
<p>and autoimmune or you probably won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>find them</p>
<p>all right melona from Ghana on Facebook</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the most common cause for left</p>
<p>shoulder pain</p>
<p>I honestly I think the most common is</p>
<p>the same thing that causes the right</p>
<p>shoulder pain which is a problem in the</p>
<p>the bile ducts there&rsquo;s like bile duct</p>
<p>sludge and the remedy for that is tadka</p>
<p>Tad cut and then also some some bile</p>
<p>salts when you eat but and then</p>
<p>correcting the diet as well because you</p>
<p>have these little bile tubes that go</p>
<p>from your liver down to the small</p>
<p>intestine through you know they</p>
<p>connected the gallbladder but also they</p>
<p>do cross over right at the to that small</p>
<p>intestine</p>
<p>and the pancreatic ducts kind of join so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say for example something&rsquo;s</p>
<p>blocked it backs up into the pancreas</p>
<p>and that refers pain to your left</p>
<p>shoulder now another cause could be</p>
<p>something related to the heart</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>you know it really depends on</p>
<p>your lifestyle and what what makes more</p>
<p>sense to you so you know if you find</p>
<p>everything</p>
<p>if you like start taking takka and you</p>
<p>still have symptoms and go get your</p>
<p>heart checked to see if there&rsquo;s any</p>
<p>problem on the left shoulder because</p>
<p>that could be referred pain from your</p>
<p>heart</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re not getting free</p>
<p>all right so watch out for that Pearl</p>
<p>from Facebook I have stage three fatty</p>
<p>liver it&rsquo;s milk thistle oil good for</p>
<p>that and do I have to stop eating fat</p>
<p>Meats because I also doing healthy keto</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>yeah I think that&rsquo;s a good remedy milk</p>
<p>thistle is really good for that</p>
<p>um you may also want to take choline</p>
<p>because that helps strip the fat off the</p>
<p>liver and uh</p>
<p>um yeah you&rsquo;re eating fatty foods the</p>
<p>key with the fatty liver is cutting down</p>
<p>on the carbs so I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing that and not having anything with</p>
<p>fructose and I think that would be the</p>
<p>best thing to do with with good</p>
<p>probiotic and a good huge salad each day</p>
<p>that would be good</p>
<p>all right very good and this is good how</p>
<p>well the audience is doing with the</p>
<p>questions ripping through them question</p>
<p>number four said what is it about</p>
<p>exercise that helps extend our lifetimes</p>
<p>and the audience hang on let me get back</p>
<p>to your shot doc uh the audience 55 of</p>
<p>them uh say exercise increases</p>
<p>mitochondria Health 25 it says it</p>
<p>increases oxygen distribution to the</p>
<p>cell 10 say it improves circulation and</p>
<p>the final 10 percent say it increases</p>
<p>the growth hormones</p>
<p>out of all the things that you can do</p>
<p>exercise is is probably at the top of</p>
<p>the list as far as extending your life</p>
<p>because it it number one</p>
<p>it causes an increase in the number of</p>
<p>mitochondria and the replenishment of</p>
<p>mitochondria which most diseases are</p>
<p>mitochondria related including cancer</p>
<p>and many other</p>
<p>brain neural neurological problems and</p>
<p>even heart problems so uh that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very very important and of course</p>
<p>getting more oxygen yes you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>get more oxygen to the cells as well</p>
<p>um and you&rsquo;re also going to burn up any</p>
<p>extra sugar a really good habit is to go</p>
<p>for a walk after you eat a meal and you</p>
<p>can burn off any excess sugar that you</p>
<p>ate and kind of protect yourself but</p>
<p>this exercise thing is like quite</p>
<p>interesting because it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>action that</p>
<p>buffers disease and extends your life</p>
<p>and it allows you to get get away with</p>
<p>some of the bad things that you may eat</p>
<p>or expose yourself during the day</p>
<p>all right very good Miguel from YouTube</p>
<p>is there a connection between insomnia</p>
<p>and the carnivore diet maybe he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>chasing wildlife in the middle of the</p>
<p>night or something</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a way to do carnivore</p>
<p>correctly and healthily um but the other</p>
<p>thing is like how are you going to get</p>
<p>your how are you going to get 4 700</p>
<p>milligrams of potassium now some people</p>
<p>say well that&rsquo;s not necessary</p>
<p>but I think the requirements</p>
<p>based on some interesting</p>
<p>data that I read that or even should be</p>
<p>higher than 4 700</p>
<p>and um so if you&rsquo;re doing just meats and</p>
<p>eggs and things like that</p>
<p>how much potassium are you really</p>
<p>getting how much magnesium are you</p>
<p>really getting</p>
<p>and then because those are the two</p>
<p>minerals that really help enhance sleep</p>
<p>um calcium also enhances sleep as well</p>
<p>but you can have maybe cheese or</p>
<p>something like that so these are things</p>
<p>that I would look at and maybe you have</p>
<p>to in the meantime when you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>carnivore</p>
<p>take up potassium supplement or</p>
<p>electrolytes and see if that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>help your sleep don&rsquo;t take it right</p>
<p>before you go to bed because you&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>peeing up peeing all night but take it</p>
<p>more in the morning but I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one factor and also sometimes for</p>
<p>people uh when you eat a lot of meat you</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you might be eating too much meat and</p>
<p>also or you might be getting too much</p>
<p>phosphorus meat has a lot of phosphorus</p>
<p>so and that&rsquo;s kind of an accelerator to</p>
<p>your nervous system</p>
<p>kind of like um</p>
<p>like the race horses in Kentucky consume</p>
<p>This Grass that&rsquo;s really high in</p>
<p>phosphorus but the cows in Wisconsin get</p>
<p>a lot of calcium from all the Limestone</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re really laid back and they</p>
<p>take a lot of naps</p>
<p>some good for them Terry takes a lot of</p>
<p>naps but that&rsquo;s and I digress oslim from</p>
<p>YouTube I&rsquo;ve been on intermittent</p>
<p>fasting for six years now and recently</p>
<p>noticed I feel fatigued after I have a</p>
<p>meal what could be the cause I&rsquo;m 100</p>
<p>keto also is it okay to work out while</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re fasting</p>
<p>yes it&rsquo;s okay to work out while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fasting but I would definitely</p>
<p>um make sure you&rsquo;re getting enough of</p>
<p>the B vitamins number one make sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting electrolytes and enough</p>
<p>sea salt number two and number three you</p>
<p>might need to take something like either</p>
<p>the the coenzyme Q10 in the form of</p>
<p>ubiquinol</p>
<p>and something called NAD which is</p>
<p>another compound that is good for the</p>
<p>mitochondria to give you more energy</p>
<p>these are just things that I would I</p>
<p>would recommend but I will say and I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think this is your situation</p>
<p>um some people are tired because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not having enough</p>
<p>high quality protein</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s your problem but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something to look at</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so you just might want to juggle it</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t have enough data to</p>
<p>really know exactly what&rsquo;s going on yeah</p>
<p>and by the way he said he&rsquo;s not 100 keto</p>
<p>so forgive me for that uh maybe oh he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not not 100 well try to go 100 keto and</p>
<p>see if see how you feel then</p>
<p>all right that makes more sense that</p>
<p>explains it okay Susanna from Facebook</p>
<p>would you recommend using pork fat for</p>
<p>cooking on keto is that lard or</p>
<p>yeah yes I would totally recommend that</p>
<p>make sure it&rsquo;s a high quality pork fat</p>
<p>but yes absolutely</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I actually like taking uh bacon and</p>
<p>um I put it in a pot and I uh kind of</p>
<p>cook it</p>
<p>and um so it really cooks a lot of the</p>
<p>fat out and then it gets crispy and then</p>
<p>I pull it out so I mean obviously</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never recommending like oh let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just drink all this extra lard from the</p>
<p>bacon but I sure do like</p>
<p>um crispy baking bacon</p>
<p>um and um if you consume it without a</p>
<p>lot of carbs it&rsquo;s I I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good it&rsquo;s it also has very high levels</p>
<p>of vitamin B1</p>
<p>and because I grow my own pork</p>
<p>um you know I I don&rsquo;t have to worry</p>
<p>about those pesticides and chemicals and</p>
<p>things like that but you just want to</p>
<p>make sure you get a high quality product</p>
<p>or at the farmer&rsquo;s market find something</p>
<p>that you know is good or raise your own</p>
<p>pigs all right very good well Harry uh</p>
<p>is from lovely Las Vegas uh he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sound like he&rsquo;s in a casino right now</p>
<p>but nevertheless he has some health</p>
<p>questions here you&rsquo;re on with Dr Berg go</p>
<p>ahead with your one question please</p>
<p>hey thanks Dr Barry Harry from Las Vegas</p>
<p>um you had mentioned previously about uh</p>
<p>intracellular testing for magnesium</p>
<p>being the you know the preferred method</p>
<p>for you know a more accurate test and I</p>
<p>looked at quests and they have two tests</p>
<p>one for serum and one for red blood</p>
<p>cells and I wasn&rsquo;t sure if the red blood</p>
<p>cell was the intracellular test or is it</p>
<p>a completely different test that I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get it no no that&rsquo;s that is the the red</p>
<p>blood cell is a really good</p>
<p>intracellular test because you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>measuring</p>
<p>uh the plasma you&rsquo;re measuring the</p>
<p>actual inside that red blood cell and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a great way to measure magnesium</p>
<p>and other other electrolytes and even</p>
<p>other vitamins so yeah that would be a</p>
<p>good good thing to do absolutely</p>
<p>awesome thank you yep you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>thank you Harry sounds like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drilling into a casino safe back there I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what that noise is but anyway</p>
<p>good luck with that I won&rsquo;t say anything</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s get back to Dr Berg here</p>
<p>um and let&rsquo;s see BB from YouTube uh will</p>
<p>a chewing gum container sucralose break</p>
<p>my fast chewing gum containing sucralose</p>
<p>sorry break my fast</p>
<p>probably not very much probably not very</p>
<p>much</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a tiny bit of some some</p>
<p>things in there I I would I would prefer</p>
<p>if you did like a chewing gum with</p>
<p>Xylitol instead</p>
<p>um but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gonna break</p>
<p>your fast too much if you do either or</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s see by the way Dr Berg</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got this great app what in what</p>
<p>condition uh is that now in terms of</p>
<p>people being able to find uh videos or</p>
<p>any other details is that something that</p>
<p>we should encourage</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s nice about the app is that you</p>
<p>can find stuff easy and you can also do</p>
<p>it on my website but you use it has a</p>
<p>good Search tool on the app so you just</p>
<p>type in this whatever you want and it</p>
<p>pops right up so</p>
<p>um that would be another good way to</p>
<p>find information because what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening now is that um recently there</p>
<p>was a</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>new policy in YouTube where they um are</p>
<p>kind of censoring health information and</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um unfortunately</p>
<p>you know my viewpoint is it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a quality it&rsquo;s not healthy</p>
<p>quality it&rsquo;s not fair it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>um they&rsquo;re replacing with things that</p>
<p>are</p>
<p>um more medical even the area of Keto</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really the main thing is like</p>
<p>um when you search for keto if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>only following negative things on keto</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s not really a fair and</p>
<p>balanced way of finding information</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you know if you if you&rsquo;re getting in the</p>
<p>news like oh yeah keto is dangerous to</p>
<p>the kidneys or you hear this or that</p>
<p>um and then you find out it&rsquo;s a total</p>
<p>bogus study and they actually fed rats a</p>
<p>high fat diet but without lowering the</p>
<p>carb true story so and then you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to think oh yeah I was going to try keto</p>
<p>but I decided not to because it was</p>
<p>dangerous so</p>
<p>um if you get the right information and</p>
<p>you get and you you have a diversity of</p>
<p>viewpoints out there you&rsquo;re not just</p>
<p>going to a restaurant and all they get</p>
<p>is one thing on the menu and no other</p>
<p>options well I think based on the survey</p>
<p>that we did people do want</p>
<p>um options they want to</p>
<p>honestly the big thing they want is they</p>
<p>want alternative things they want</p>
<p>something that um is effective and um</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of people who have</p>
<p>done the healthy keto that have gotten</p>
<p>results in fact</p>
<p>keto is not dangerous it&rsquo;s not harmful</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s extremely effective and go to my</p>
<p>website sometime and just read some of</p>
<p>those 7 000 success stories and see for</p>
<p>yourself it&rsquo;s and there&rsquo;s a tab on my</p>
<p>website too on keto that I have a lot of</p>
<p>great additional researched information</p>
<p>that you can see um</p>
<p>the flip side of that deposit and</p>
<p>positives on keto so then you can make</p>
<p>an evaluation to see if you want to do</p>
<p>it or not</p>
<p>yeah and by the way Dr Burgess is the</p>
<p>great majority of what he talks about is</p>
<p>how to stay healthy and not end up with</p>
<p>some of these diseases and my health and</p>
<p>a good spirit is is directly measurable</p>
<p>not only by my observation but also by</p>
<p>my doctor by my MD by blood test Etc my</p>
<p>cholesterol is in check my sugars in</p>
<p>check I feel great I&rsquo;m doing just</p>
<p>terrifically and that&rsquo;s not Counter</p>
<p>Culture stuff that&rsquo;s mainstream medicine</p>
<p>measuring the results of my association</p>
<p>with Dr Berg and following many of his</p>
<p>dictates I&rsquo;m not perfect but I&rsquo;ll tell</p>
<p>you what anything helps and it certainly</p>
<p>helped me a tremendous amount so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry that we&rsquo;re all having to go</p>
<p>through that but once again if you have</p>
<p>a moment go to drburg.com sign up for</p>
<p>the newsletter and we will never lose</p>
<p>touch with any of um you know our folks</p>
<p>that are constantly bragging here that</p>
<p>they have lost this many pounds they</p>
<p>feel great and want to continue so</p>
<p>um so that is fantastic why don&rsquo;t we go</p>
<p>ahead with the final quiz question of</p>
<p>the day and there it is</p>
<p>okay what is the single best action to</p>
<p>help</p>
<p>you fall asleep faster if you are</p>
<p>stressed now this could be like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to just go to sleep at night and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just like you got things going in</p>
<p>your mind or you get up in the middle of</p>
<p>night and you&rsquo;re just like you start</p>
<p>thinking right and you start worrying uh</p>
<p>what would be the the thing that you</p>
<p>could do to really</p>
<p>fix that problem and put yourself right</p>
<p>back into sleep okay well here&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>perfect time to bring up this graphic</p>
<p>about talking about uh availability or</p>
<p>products internationally because Alina</p>
<p>on YouTube wants to know if you can get</p>
<p>her some stuff uh in Australia ship some</p>
<p>stuff down under</p>
<p>that is the last area that we&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>at trying to figure out because it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a slight distance from the U.S</p>
<p>so uh we&rsquo;re working that out stay tuned</p>
<p>very soon because we we have attention</p>
<p>on that</p>
<p>um for sure</p>
<p>all right well I got a</p>
<p>I can help Elena just swing by my place</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you some of my nutritional</p>
<p>yeast I&rsquo;ll give you a couple of jugs for</p>
<p>your your trouble and then soon</p>
<p>thereafter I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll have some</p>
<p>remedy for getting these great Goods</p>
<p>into Australia Gordon from YouTube well</p>
<p>apple cider vinegar help with thyroid</p>
<p>issues</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m not sure but I I know it&rsquo;ll help</p>
<p>with your digestion help with your blood</p>
<p>sugars and um with the thyroid you may</p>
<p>need uh selenium for example or you may</p>
<p>need iodine I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>um but I know it can&rsquo;t hurt so maybe try</p>
<p>and see what happens</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s see we&rsquo;re still waiting</p>
<p>for our quiz answer</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>oh here we go how about samit from</p>
<p>Facebook please share your</p>
<p>recommendations for someone suffering</p>
<p>from asthma and eczema thank you he says</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I think the best thing to take is</p>
<p>vitamin D</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll it&rsquo;ll help both of those</p>
<p>conditions but you need a little bit</p>
<p>more than you probably were taking so 50</p>
<p>000 I use take it with a</p>
<p>a meal two</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>so because that that can help</p>
<p>inflammation in your skin</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>as well as asthma in fact children that</p>
<p>that are outside in the sun</p>
<p>um that are asthmatic tend to get much</p>
<p>better really quick</p>
<p>so that vitamin D from either the Sun or</p>
<p>a supplement will help asthma</p>
<p>interesting uh here&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s hear from</p>
<p>hey one two three is the handle from</p>
<p>this person on YouTube I periodically</p>
<p>get quarter size white spots on my face</p>
<p>over the last five years or so my</p>
<p>dermatologist has no idea what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on what&rsquo;s your take on his quarter size</p>
<p>white spots and odd name</p>
<p>I mean I&rsquo;m thinking it&rsquo;s Vitiligo if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s white spots right it&rsquo;s a lack of</p>
<p>pigment which usually is an adrenal</p>
<p>stress problem</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah I think I would um</p>
<p>I would do something to help the the</p>
<p>cortisol level that could be too low and</p>
<p>I think the best remedy for that</p>
<p>especially Vitiligo is the vitamin D</p>
<p>at 40 to 50 000 I use every single day</p>
<p>and of course at the same time if there</p>
<p>is a stress situation do whatever you</p>
<p>can to minimize it or improve it</p>
<p>all right very good the audience has</p>
<p>successfully completed their entire exam</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s the final question which asks</p>
<p>what is the single best action to help</p>
<p>you fall asleep faster</p>
<p>if you were stressed 70 percent of our</p>
<p>respondents say exercise is the key to</p>
<p>better sleep I believe that 10 percent</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s deep breathing uh 10 say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>taking magnesium and the final 10 say it</p>
<p>is taking melatonin a very popular</p>
<p>remedy whether it works</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the breathing the breathing and</p>
<p>this is very very inexpensive it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>cost you too much</p>
<p>um you just change your breath and what</p>
<p>you do</p>
<p>as you uh you you do a five second</p>
<p>inhalation</p>
<p>and a five second exhalation through</p>
<p>your stomach through the nose okay and</p>
<p>you do that</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re trying to go to sleep and</p>
<p>really just focus on the breathing now</p>
<p>maybe</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s the middle of the night</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to get back to sleep and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know you don&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t feel like</p>
<p>you need to breathe that much well then</p>
<p>do a a three second in and three second</p>
<p>out but the key is keeping the the</p>
<p>breasts</p>
<p>um synchronized the same and slowing it</p>
<p>down and bringing through the nose and</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re going to notice is by the</p>
<p>next thing you know you&rsquo;re waking up and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like wow that really worked I use</p>
<p>it all the time I use it to go to sleep</p>
<p>even if I get up in the middle of night</p>
<p>I use it to get back to sleep it really</p>
<p>works if you if you find yourself not</p>
<p>being able to sleep notice what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening with your breath you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably holding your breath some way</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting all right relax folks</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get some sleep Igor from Facebook</p>
<p>what are the best foods to unclog Our</p>
<p>arteries</p>
<p>just did a video on that</p>
<p>it would be um</p>
<p>um a really good one would be uh</p>
<p>something loaded with vitamin K2 and</p>
<p>that would be sauerkraut</p>
<p>sauerkraut and also brie cheese</p>
<p>these are loaded with K2</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>one thing you want to avoid is the</p>
<p>grains and the sugars and the</p>
<p>um sweets and the junk foods and have a</p>
<p>combination of good animal meats and</p>
<p>high quality vegetables</p>
<p>with the sauerkraut being the fermented</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll give you the vitamin K2 as well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great in his promise we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>staying a little bit after the hour to</p>
<p>make up for our late start uh</p>
<p>from Facebook how long should we take</p>
<p>tadka and bile salts is there a</p>
<p>period of time to do that it&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>depends on what&rsquo;s going on so I would</p>
<p>take it for maybe I don&rsquo;t know six weeks</p>
<p>and reevaluate to see if you need it</p>
<p>then you come off of it and see if</p>
<p>things are stabilizing</p>
<p>all right very good and if they are then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re good well then you&rsquo;re good that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wonderful good news Corey from YouTube</p>
<p>can wine have an impact on the</p>
<p>gallbladder my doctor wants uh mine</p>
<p>removed should I give up wine altogether</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s really hard to give that</p>
<p>up right well unfortunately yes</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>alcohol for some reason your liver</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t like alcohol and that bile is</p>
<p>made by the liver I think it&rsquo;s stored in</p>
<p>the gallbladder and your gallbladder</p>
<p>also doesn&rsquo;t like alcohol so they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a good mix</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>oh I&rsquo;m sorry yeah and you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always are you using the cube with a</p>
<p>little tube hanging out of it you know</p>
<p>that could explain a lot so the amount</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure makes a difference uh mister</p>
<p>and A1 where do they give these handles</p>
<p>from YouTube</p>
<p>I know hateful thing it&rsquo;ll make them</p>
<p>tough though they get beat up at school</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;ll toughen them right up how do</p>
<p>we maintain our weight once we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>reached our ideal BMI number while doing</p>
<p>keto and intermittent fasting</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>well let&rsquo;s say you don&rsquo;t want to lose</p>
<p>weight you don&rsquo;t want to gain weight you</p>
<p>have to make some adjustments with the</p>
<p>amount of fats</p>
<p>um so because if you keep going you</p>
<p>might get too thin and that&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>problem so we want to add more fat to</p>
<p>the diet so that way the calories that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re burning are the dietary fat not</p>
<p>your own fat anymore and then you might</p>
<p>want to adjust the calories of just your</p>
<p>general food you know if you you might</p>
<p>just need to eat more don&rsquo;t forget to</p>
<p>add exercise too to build up the muscles</p>
<p>as part of that weight</p>
<p>and on that note Steve</p>
<p>um let&rsquo;s sign off thank you very much</p>
<p>for all your wonderful comments I will</p>
<p>see you guys next week same time same</p>
<p>flights</p>
