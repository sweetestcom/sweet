    <p>Our card this week is Maggie Long, the Four of Spades from Colorado.</p>
<p>In 2017, 17-year-old Maggie went missing in rural Park County, Colorado, only to be found</p>
<p>hours later as the victim of the most brutal murder the area had ever seen.</p>
<p>For the past five years, Maggie&rsquo;s horrific murder has weighed on law enforcement in the</p>
<p>small community, as they&rsquo;ve struggled to get any answers to the nagging questions surrounding</p>
<p>her case.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>It was around 7 p.m. on December 1st, 2017, when Connie Lewis pulled up to her little</p>
<p>sister&rsquo;s high school in Bailey, Colorado.</p>
<p>Her sister Maggie was helping with a Christmas concert that night, and Connie promised that</p>
<p>she would be in attendance.</p>
<p>She even planned to stay the weekend so the two could go Christmas shopping together.</p>
<p>But when Connie walked inside the high school, she wasn&rsquo;t met with Christmas cheer.</p>
<p>Instead, she was greeted by her younger brother, Derek, and several of Maggie&rsquo;s friends who</p>
<p>were standing around looking worried.</p>
<p>Everyone is asking where Maggie is.</p>
<p>Do you know where Maggie is?</p>
<p>Like, Maggie&rsquo;s in charge of the VIP lounge.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s supposed to bring all the refreshments and the snacks and everything.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s Maggie?</p>
<p>Immediately, a wave of concern washed over Connie.</p>
<p>Maggie was super responsible, so she wouldn&rsquo;t just not show up for something without telling</p>
<p>someone, especially if it was an event that she helped organize.</p>
<p>But before freaking out, Connie wanted to make sure Maggie hadn&rsquo;t just somehow totally</p>
<p>spaced the concert or lost track of time or something.</p>
<p>Connie stepped outside to call Maggie, but her phone went straight to voicemail, which</p>
<p>actually kind of happened a lot around there because Bailey is a pretty rural, mountainous</p>
<p>place and the reception is spotty.</p>
<p>So Connie knew it was possible Maggie just didn&rsquo;t have service wherever she was.</p>
<p>At this point, I&rsquo;m thinking she&rsquo;s at the house because sometimes she gets so busy and she</p>
<p>exhausts herself to the point where she&rsquo;ll just like take a nap for a couple hours.</p>
<p>So I was like, maybe she like fell asleep, but I waited around to see if she&rsquo;ll show</p>
<p>up and I kept my eye on the door and she, and at this time, like the opening band has</p>
<p>started and I&rsquo;m like, okay, she&rsquo;s still not here.</p>
<p>I was getting that like weird gut feeling that something was off.</p>
<p>So Connie left to go to her parents&rsquo; house, which was like this huge two-story house that</p>
<p>they owned where the family lived on the first floor and they actually rented out the smaller</p>
<p>top floor.</p>
<p>On the 10-mile drive there, Connie kept trying to call the man who was currently renting</p>
<p>out that second story.</p>
<p>His name was Robert.</p>
<p>And Robert had just been texting Connie about an hour prior, something about weird noises</p>
<p>at the house and how the lights were flickering.</p>
<p>So she knew that he was home, but now he wasn&rsquo;t picking up.</p>
<p>His phone was going straight to voicemail too.</p>
<p>So she eventually just left him a voicemail asking him to go check and see if Maggie was</p>
<p>downstairs asleep.</p>
<p>When Connie finally arrived at the family home, she turned into the three-quarters-of-a-mile</p>
<p>long winding driveway.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when her stomach dropped.</p>
<p>Even though she could hardly see the house from the end of the driveway through the layers</p>
<p>of trees, it was immediately clear that something terrible had happened.</p>
<p>There was a lot of commotion.</p>
<p>There was like a ton, a ton of sirens.</p>
<p>And I could still smell the smoke, but our house, the driveway kind of winds up into</p>
<p>the woods.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t see very plainly from the county road what was going on.</p>
<p>Like, I could just see the lights kind of, you could see it like through the trees.</p>
<p>With a pit in her stomach, Connie continued down the driveway and the scene she found</p>
<p>was overwhelming.</p>
<p>Connie&rsquo;s mom, Heather, had just arrived home too, and they were taking it all in together.</p>
<p>Patrol cars and fire trucks were crowded in front of the house, which was enveloped in</p>
<p>billowing smoke, though the house was still standing.</p>
<p>And I just stopped there and I was like, okay, what&rsquo;s happening?</p>
<p>And there was a fireman who, he like vaguely mentioned like, oh yeah, it seems like there</p>
<p>was a burglary.</p>
<p>We did like, there are some missing weapons.</p>
<p>And I remember him saying like, it&rsquo;s just really messed up.</p>
<p>And I was like, huh?</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t, I didn&rsquo;t know what was happening, I was very confused.</p>
<p>Adding to the confusion was something else Connie and her mom saw in the driveway, and</p>
<p>that was Maggie&rsquo;s car, which meant that Maggie had to be home, but they didn&rsquo;t see her anywhere</p>
<p>outside.</p>
<p>So, at this point, we don&rsquo;t know where Maggie is, because they&rsquo;re not telling us.</p>
<p>And I kept asking, like, is Maggie okay, is she in there?</p>
<p>Where is she?</p>
<p>And nobody was telling us anything.</p>
<p>All Connie knew was that there had been a fire, the home had possibly been burglarized,</p>
<p>and her little sister was still missing.</p>
<p>So with no answers in sight, Connie did what any good big sister would do.</p>
<p>She began calling people, getting the word out about Maggie&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>One of the first people she phoned was their older sister, Linna, who was living 900 miles</p>
<p>away in Minneapolis at the time.</p>
<p>Connie called me and was, you know, sounding very emotional, kind of relayed the scenario</p>
<p>that she kind of just said that somebody was wrong with the house, it seemed like there</p>
<p>was a fire, that they can&rsquo;t find Maggie.</p>
<p>Being so far away and feeling helpless, Linna did what she could to help find her little</p>
<p>sister.</p>
<p>She posted on Facebook, begging for anyone who had seen Maggie to call the police immediately.</p>
<p>Linna&rsquo;s Facebook post read in part, quote, please, anybody who is from Bailey, Colorado,</p>
<p>I need your help.</p>
<p>My sister Maggie Long is missing.</p>
<p>Time is of the essence.</p>
<p>She is 17 years old, Asian female, long brown hair with blonde highlights.</p>
<p>She was supposed to be at the high school concert tonight.</p>
<p>Any details are welcome, end quote.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to the Long family, as Linna was making that post, first responders were processing</p>
<p>a baffling crime scene inside their home that was unlike anything the community of</p>
<p>Bailey had ever seen before.</p>
<p>Just like the firefighter implied to Connie, the home had been completely ransacked, and</p>
<p>it looked like there had been a burglary.</p>
<p>A huge firearm safe that looked like it had been dragged from the primary bedroom was</p>
<p>laying in the middle of the living room, which right away told responders that they were</p>
<p>dealing with more than one perpetrator if they were able to lug that safe into the living</p>
<p>room.</p>
<p>Other items were scattered about, almost like there had been some kind of struggle.</p>
<p>And there was a trail of accelerant throughout the home, which solidified the theory that</p>
<p>they all probably had at this point.</p>
<p>They were looking at a burglary turned arson.</p>
<p>The whole home had sustained heavy smoke damage.</p>
<p>But as they searched the house, they realized there was only one room that bore the brunt</p>
<p>of the fire.</p>
<p>Wendy Kipple, who at the time was an investigator with the district attorney&rsquo;s office in Park</p>
<p>County, was on the scene that day, and she recalled that the whole room, which they determined</p>
<p>was a bedroom, was burned down pretty much to the studs.</p>
<p>Everything was really burnt in there and unrecognizable pretty much as objects.</p>
<p>Among the heaps of ashes and unidentifiable scorched objects, they saw something that</p>
<p>was recognizable, something that they would never be able to unsee.</p>
<p>Atop what looked like a bed was a severely burned human body.</p>
<p>The body was so badly burned that it was impossible to even loosely identify.</p>
<p>Parts of the limbs had even been burned off.</p>
<p>But there was one thing that was immediately clear.</p>
<p>The person had been restrained, with their arms behind their back, and a coat had been</p>
<p>pulled down over the victim&rsquo;s hands, which actually preserved them, and duct tape was</p>
<p>used to tie them together.</p>
<p>And although first responders couldn&rsquo;t identify the body right away, they knew Maggie</p>
<p>was missing.</p>
<p>So putting two and two together, they notified Connie and her mom.</p>
<p>After breaking the news to the family, authorities knew that they couldn&rsquo;t stay quiet.</p>
<p>They had to address the public.</p>
<p>Bailey is a tight-knit community of about 8,000 people, and law enforcement knew that</p>
<p>everyone was worried sick about Maggie.</p>
<p>So the Park County undersheriff wrote a statement about the situation that was posted on Facebook</p>
<p>the very next day.</p>
<p>The post is now deleted, but The Flume reported that it read in part, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;On-scene investigation is wrapped up.</p>
<p>Cause and origin of the fire is inconclusive.</p>
<p>Still no sign of her.</p>
<p>No body at the fire scene.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>And yeah, you heard that right.</p>
<p>Nobody at the scene.</p>
<p>Why the sheriff&rsquo;s office felt the need to blatantly lie to the public like that is something</p>
<p>present-day investigators still struggle to wrap their minds around.</p>
<p>I still to this day do not know why they didn&rsquo;t want to put out there that Maggie</p>
<p>was in fact found at the house.</p>
<p>Her family knew because they notified them right away.</p>
<p>They knew she was dead, but yet they were still putting it out to the public that Maggie</p>
<p>was still missing.</p>
<p>And I just, it blew my mind as an investigator with the district attorney&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>I think maybe they thought they could get whoever committed this crime before it got</p>
<p>out that she was murdered.</p>
<p>With the public still in the dark about what happened, investigators began interviewing</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>And one of the first people that they talked with was the person who called 911.</p>
<p>That upstairs tenant, Robert.</p>
<p>Robert told investigators that he left work that day at around 7.45 in the morning and</p>
<p>then didn&rsquo;t return to his apartment until 6.40 p.m.</p>
<p>When he got home, he said that he saw Maggie&rsquo;s silver Cadillac parked right out in front</p>
<p>but didn&rsquo;t notice any other strange vehicles in the driveway or anything.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until Robert got into his upstairs apartment and settled in that he realized</p>
<p>something was off.</p>
<p>He heard concerning noises from the first floor, like lots of banging and commotion.</p>
<p>Then he started smelling smoke.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s when he texted Connie.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re probably asking yourself why Robert texted Connie instead of reaching out to somebody</p>
<p>who currently lived at the Long&rsquo;s house like Connie&rsquo;s parents or even their younger brother</p>
<p>Derek or even Maggie.</p>
<p>But Connie told our reporting team that she recalls Robert actually texted her mom first,</p>
<p>but she was likely too busy at the restaurant to respond.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s when Connie and Robert started texting.</p>
<p>She said they had each other&rsquo;s numbers because they used to work at the restaurant together.</p>
<p>So anyways, as the loud noises continued, Robert told investigators that he grew more</p>
<p>and more worried.</p>
<p>So about 20 minutes after he got home, this would have been just before 7 p.m., he called</p>
<p>911.</p>
<p>And he said that after he made that call, he saw a man standing out in the driveway.</p>
<p>And he heard the sounds and he went out his door and there&rsquo;s like a small deck area and</p>
<p>then steep stairs that went down to the front of the house.</p>
<p>And he went out and kind of looked out and he saw this guy standing at the bottom of</p>
<p>the stairs.</p>
<p>But he was standing back enough that that guy, he said, couldn&rsquo;t see him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like peeking the edge and he could see him.</p>
<p>Robert said that from where he was standing, he couldn&rsquo;t see any strange cars that he could</p>
<p>offer investigators a description of.</p>
<p>But he did get a really good look at the man.</p>
<p>He described him and what he was wearing and he said he was wearing like khaki colored</p>
<p>shorts, long shorts and a t-shirt, which for December, that&rsquo;s kind of unusual, unusual</p>
<p>dress for up here.</p>
<p>While investigators were talking with Robert, other detectives were interviewing Maggie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>family, trying to piece together what Maggie had been doing that day.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the timeline that they came up with.</p>
<p>She left for school at 6.30 that morning and stayed there till around 2.40 in the afternoon</p>
<p>when she told friends that she was leaving to go home to grab snacks and water for the</p>
<p>VIP lounge at the concert.</p>
<p>That would have put her arriving home at around 3.10 p.m.</p>
<p>And we know that 911 call came in around 7, which meant that there were nearly four hours</p>
<p>unaccounted for.</p>
<p>Because so much of the evidence was destroyed in the fire, investigators were left to speculate</p>
<p>about the horrors that happened in that window.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re pretty sure she was sexually assaulted and they maybe tried to get the combination</p>
<p>of the safe from her.</p>
<p>She probably gave them the combination of her safe that they brought from her room into</p>
<p>the master bedroom.</p>
<p>But she may not have known the combination to the big safe that had the large amount</p>
<p>of cash in it and sexually assaulted her in her room, bound her hands behind her back.</p>
<p>Through talking with Maggie&rsquo;s family, authorities were also able to identify what items had</p>
<p>been stolen in what now they knew was a robbery.</p>
<p>A green gun safe and all of its contents were gone.</p>
<p>There were some jade figurines from Maggie&rsquo;s safe that were missing.</p>
<p>A pearl necklace that had been gifted to Maggie from her parents, an AK-47 style rifle,</p>
<p>a Beretta handgun and somewhere around 2,000 rounds of ammunition.</p>
<p>Now Maggie&rsquo;s parents had the serial number for the AK-47 that they could provide police,</p>
<p>but unfortunately they couldn&rsquo;t find the serial number for the Beretta handgun.</p>
<p>For the serial number that they did have though, investigators entered that into the National</p>
<p>Crime Information Center, or NCIC, so they&rsquo;d be notified if a gun with that serial number</p>
<p>was ever recovered from another crime or if it was sold legally.</p>
<p>But to this day, there have been no hits.</p>
<p>While all of this was going on, investigators were having Robert sit down with a sketch</p>
<p>artist to create a composite of this mystery man that he saw.</p>
<p>There were no security cameras or anything that saw this guy, so detectives had no choice</p>
<p>but to rely solely on Robert&rsquo;s memory.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to put that sketch that they created in the blog post for this episode, which is</p>
<p>on our website, thedeckpodcast.com.</p>
<p>The drawing is of a young white man, possibly in his 20s, with a very short haircut.</p>
<p>He had almond-shaped eyes and this square chin.</p>
<p>Now none of his features are super pronounced, so he really just kind of looks like your</p>
<p>average Joe.</p>
<p>But even after getting this sketch, investigators weren&rsquo;t done with Robert just yet.</p>
<p>They also wanted to vet his alibi before clearing him as a potential suspect.</p>
<p>I mean, on paper, he seemed like a promising person of interest.</p>
<p>He had no relation to the family at all.</p>
<p>He was a newer tenant.</p>
<p>And since he used to work for the Longs, he likely knew their schedule.</p>
<p>So investigators checked with Robert&rsquo;s employer, who confirmed that he was at work when he</p>
<p>said he was, until 6.15 that evening, which would have put him arriving home at around</p>
<p>6.40, just like he said.</p>
<p>And that wouldn&rsquo;t have given him enough time to commit the crime before calling 911.</p>
<p>So with that, he was cleared as a suspect.</p>
<p>Back at the Longs&rsquo; home, an arson investigator with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation</p>
<p>was carefully examining the scene.</p>
<p>He determined that the accelerant used to start the fire was gasoline from a gas can</p>
<p>in the Longs&rsquo; garage.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t even something that the killers had brought with them.</p>
<p>It was looking more and more like this was a crime of opportunity, like the assailants</p>
<p>had no plans to kill when they entered that home.</p>
<p>But then something changed.</p>
<p>As investigators continued sifting through the home and collecting evidence, they were</p>
<p>still being secretive about what really happened.</p>
<p>There had been no communication to the public to clear up what the undersheriff had said,</p>
<p>and authorities were unwavering in their silence, even as the days passed by.</p>
<p>Three days after the fire, which would have been December 4th, Maggie&rsquo;s autopsy got</p>
<p>underway, and it confirmed what detectives suspected all along.</p>
<p>Since both of her hands were well-preserved, the coroner&rsquo;s office was able to compare</p>
<p>fingerprints from Maggie&rsquo;s driver&rsquo;s license, and it was a match.</p>
<p>But because of the state of her body, the coroner was unable to determine if she&rsquo;d</p>
<p>been sexually assaulted, but they were able to determine how she died.</p>
<p>Wendy Kipple was present at the autopsy that day and remembers the horrifying discovery</p>
<p>well.</p>
<p>Her trachea had soot inside of it, and the only way that happens is if you&rsquo;re alive</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in the fire.</p>
<p>So she was literally burned alive.</p>
<p>This is probably the most brutal murder I have ever seen in my career.</p>
<p>And I just, I can&rsquo;t imagine the horror that that poor girl went through.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the only thing the autopsy uncovered.</p>
<p>The coroner also scraped Maggie&rsquo;s fingernails and got some possible DNA, which was sent</p>
<p>off for testing.</p>
<p>But after the autopsy, the Park County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office and the District Attorney&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>did something weird.</p>
<p>Instead of sharing the devastating news with the community that there was a body found</p>
<p>in the fire, and it sadly was Maggie, they just stayed quiet.</p>
<p>In fact, they wanted to make sure that everyone else stayed quiet, too.</p>
<p>So on the day of the autopsy, a gag order was issued, which obviously only added to</p>
<p>the confusion for the community, because to them, this was still only a missing persons</p>
<p>case and a possible arson.</p>
<p>So we couldn&rsquo;t talk about the case and we couldn&rsquo;t say Maggie&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s why they put out the gag order, to keep people, anybody close to the</p>
<p>case from saying, no, there was actually a body found in the house and it turned out</p>
<p>to be Maggie.</p>
<p>While investigators were staying quiet, waiting for the perpetrators to come forward, Maggie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>family was quietly mourning their unspeakable loss.</p>
<p>Their sweet Maggie, who was just days away from her 18th birthday, was so suddenly and</p>
<p>horribly stolen from them.</p>
<p>Linna and Connie told our reporting team that their sister was the best person to be around.</p>
<p>She was funny and smart and caring and a huge overachiever.</p>
<p>She was involved in just about everything a high schooler could be.</p>
<p>Key clubs, student council, music theater, drama club, and even speech and debate.</p>
<p>I think kind of just aside from the things that she did and the things that she participated</p>
<p>in, Maggie was always a very social and inclusive person who was very emotionally intelligent</p>
<p>and just like a social butterfly, like just a very inclusive person, just very warm and</p>
<p>super funny.</p>
<p>She was hilarious, just super nerdy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the interactions we would have with her because she would just laugh really hard.</p>
<p>Making her laugh was something that I loved to do because then she would just lose it</p>
<p>and hyperventilate and that would make me be really silly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny because me and her had a pretty significant age difference, like nine years.</p>
<p>But even despite that, it was just like, she always brought out the silliness in me.</p>
<p>She would throw her head back, throw her body back in like full body laughter.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And she would always do that.</p>
<p>She did this thing where she would say something or when somebody would respond to her in a</p>
<p>way that she thought was weird, she would kind of do a weird side eye as if there was</p>
<p>like a third party, as if there was like a camera right there.</p>
<p>She would break the fourth wall.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Kind of like in the office, you know, when Jim would just like look at the camera, she</p>
<p>would do that.</p>
<p>It was really funny.</p>
<p>She would always like apologize when she would run into inanimate objects.</p>
<p>I actually made a sorry jar for her so that every time she like said sorry to an object,</p>
<p>she had to put a dollar in it.</p>
<p>The Longs had to privately grieve, to say goodbye to those side eyes and apologies and</p>
<p>all the things that they loved about Maggie that were taken away without warning.</p>
<p>By whom?</p>
<p>Whispers were slowly spreading around the community about what had really happened to</p>
<p>Maggie, even though the authorities weren&rsquo;t talking.</p>
<p>And tips began coming in here and there with people reporting suspicious cars that they</p>
<p>saw speeding away from the direction of the Longs house on the eve of December 1st.</p>
<p>A few people saw a silver or white minivan driving away from the home, but that description</p>
<p>alone wasn&rsquo;t super helpful because in rural Colorado, that&rsquo;s like trying to find a poorly</p>
<p>described needle in a haystack.</p>
<p>As the days passed by with no word from authorities about the status of the case, the community</p>
<p>at large was becoming increasingly frustrated because with every passing day, they grew</p>
<p>more convinced that the rumors they were hearing were true.</p>
<p>And there was a lot of, I mean, chatter on social media about how the investigation was</p>
<p>being handled and that people of the community felt like the sheriff&rsquo;s office was hiding</p>
<p>stuff from the community.</p>
<p>And they were understandably upset because they felt like, well, we have a killer at</p>
<p>large and they&rsquo;re still saying that Maggie&rsquo;s just missing.</p>
<p>So a lot of people in the community were upset and still are upset about it.</p>
<p>And understandably so.</p>
<p>The community would remain in the dark about the truth until December 7th, almost a week</p>
<p>after the fire, when Park County Sheriff Fred Wegner broke the silence and issued a press release.</p>
<p>The release read in part, quote, it comes with great sadness.</p>
<p>We report that human remains discovered in the burned home of the Long family have been</p>
<p>positively identified as those of 17 year old Maggie Long.</p>
<p>We would like the community to help us in this endeavor and ask that you reach out to</p>
<p>us to report if you observed any suspicious vehicles, individuals, or activities along</p>
<p>County Road 43 in Bailey on December 1st, 2017.</p>
<p>At this time, due to ongoing activities in this case, the sheriff&rsquo;s office will not</p>
<p>comment on any details or status of the investigation, signed Sheriff Fred Wegner.</p>
<p>The community was devastated.</p>
<p>Not only was it confirmed that Maggie was gone, but also that they had been blatantly</p>
<p>lied to by the sheriff&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>The staff of the local newspaper, The Flume, asked Sheriff Wegner why his office made that</p>
<p>false claim to the public the day after the fire.</p>
<p>He replied, quote, we made our comment, we&rsquo;ll live with it, end quote.</p>
<p>The public was heartbroken, but they now knew the truth and tips began flooding in.</p>
<p>One person even called local police and said that they could give descriptions of two suspicious</p>
<p>people they saw that day.</p>
<p>Somebody said, hey, we saw this vehicle coming at a high rate of speed down the road from</p>
<p>the direction of the Long&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s December at seven o&rsquo;clock at night on a windy, narrow road.</p>
<p>They said these, these two guys they saw in that vehicle.</p>
<p>How do you see them at seven o&rsquo;clock at night in the dark on a windy road going past each</p>
<p>other at 45 miles an hour?</p>
<p>Even though it seemed unlikely that the witnesses&rsquo; memory of these two guys was reliable, the</p>
<p>sheriff&rsquo;s office was in no position to be turning away potential leads.</p>
<p>So they had the tipster work with a sketch artist to make composites.</p>
<p>You can see those images on our website as well.</p>
<p>The sheriff&rsquo;s office also caught wind of rumors that might point to a potential motive</p>
<p>for the robbery and murder.</p>
<p>Supposedly, the Long&rsquo;s were having money problems, even though they owned two popular</p>
<p>restaurants and a liquor store.</p>
<p>But the gossip was that they owed some money, and that&rsquo;s why all of this happened.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not super clear how seriously this rumor was taken, but it seems like it</p>
<p>would have been easy to brush off because, like I said, the Long&rsquo;s were successful</p>
<p>business owners and investigators were becoming more and more convinced that was actually</p>
<p>the reason they were targeted, not because of money problems, but because of their money.</p>
<p>The Long&rsquo;s had Asian food restaurants in Park County and one liquor store.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t deposit their cash that they aren&rsquo;t too trusting of the banks.</p>
<p>So they keep their cash at home.</p>
<p>And there was a large amount of cash in the big safe.</p>
<p>So police&rsquo;s theory was that Maggie got home that day and had interrupted a burglary in</p>
<p>progress.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why she was killed.</p>
<p>But it was a theory that they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to prove until they caught the killers</p>
<p>themselves, a hope that was fading more and more as the days crept by.</p>
<p>Eventually, authorities got the results back from the skin cells found under Maggie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fingernails.</p>
<p>But the results weren&rsquo;t exactly what they&rsquo;d hoped for.</p>
<p>Testing revealed that the cells were from two separate people, but the DNA was only</p>
<p>enough for partial profiles.</p>
<p>That meant that they wouldn&rsquo;t be uploaded to any databases.</p>
<p>But they were enough that if any future suspects came on their radar, they could do a direct</p>
<p>comparison.</p>
<p>But six months went by and there were no suspects, no one to compare to that DNA.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when another eerily similar case in Missouri had everyone hopeful that Maggie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>killers had been caught.</p>
<p>In June, two men broke into a 20-year-old woman&rsquo;s home in Johnson County, Missouri.</p>
<p>They tied her up, beat her, and demanded that she give them the combination to her safe.</p>
<p>She refused, so they poured gasoline on her.</p>
<p>They lit her on fire and then fled.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the woman survived.</p>
<p>She somehow managed to escape and put out the flames on her skin.</p>
<p>Just days later, law enforcement announced that they&rsquo;d caught the guys who had done</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>They were 23-year-old Antonio Bowen and 22-year-old Vincent Rist.</p>
<p>When word of this horrible crime spread to Bailey, everyone was optimistic that these</p>
<p>were the same guys who took Maggie&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>I mean, both cases were home invasion robberies that ended with a woman being lit on fire</p>
<p>that happened just months apart.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t just the striking similarities in the case that stuck out to the small Park</p>
<p>County community.</p>
<p>It was the fact that one of the suspects, Vincent, bore a striking resemblance to the</p>
<p>first composite sketch created for Maggie&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>I mean, it literally looked like a drawing of this guy.</p>
<p>We actually have the composite next to his mugshot on the blog post for this episode.</p>
<p>But just as quickly as everyone had gotten their hopes up that these were the killers,</p>
<p>their hopes were dashed.</p>
<p>Colorado investigators compared the partial DNA profiles that they had gotten from Maggie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fingernails with the two guys arrested in Missouri, and neither of them matched.</p>
<p>It was a dead end.</p>
<p>The months continued to drag by with no substantial leads.</p>
<p>The anniversary of Maggie&rsquo;s death came and went, and detectives were no closer to catching</p>
<p>her killers than they were on day one.</p>
<p>Even though the community was a year removed from the heinous crime, it was still fresh</p>
<p>in their hearts, and they wanted to honor Maggie the best way that they could.</p>
<p>So in December, to celebrate what would have been her 19th birthday, friends, family, and</p>
<p>members of the community joined together and handed out sandwiches to those in need, which</p>
<p>is exactly what Maggie had planned to do on her 18th birthday.</p>
<p>Despite Maggie&rsquo;s loved ones keeping her memory alive, and law enforcement so desperately</p>
<p>wanting to give her the justice she deserved, the case went cold.</p>
<p>Even as turnover happened and new eyes were put on the case, there was still little movement.</p>
<p>In 2019, Park County welcomed a new sheriff, and he brought on Wendy Kipple as a detective,</p>
<p>but the case was still stuck in a rut.</p>
<p>I mean, investigators chased down small leads here and there, but the next big development</p>
<p>in the case wouldn&rsquo;t come until May of 2021.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when the FBI made an announcement no one was expecting.</p>
<p>They were now investigating Maggie&rsquo;s murder as a hate crime.</p>
<p>This was huge for the case.</p>
<p>It meant investigators would have additional resources and manpower to pour into finding</p>
<p>Maggie&rsquo;s killers, but the announcement was met with confusion from the community.</p>
<p>In Colorado, a hate crime is legally defined as, quote,</p>
<p>a threat or act of intimidation, harassment, or physical force that is motivated by bias</p>
<p>against a person or group based on their actual or perceived race, color, religion, ancestry,</p>
<p>national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, and physical or mental disability,</p>
<p>end quote.</p>
<p>Now, up to this point, the public was under the impression, based on what they were getting</p>
<p>from authorities, that Maggie was killed because she interrupted a burglary.</p>
<p>She was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
<p>So were police still holding back material info that completely changes the lens in which</p>
<p>one would view this case?</p>
<p>And if so, what are they holding back?</p>
<p>It seems like this big question mark looming over the case is one that hasn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>been publicly addressed.</p>
<p>So our reporting team asked Maggie&rsquo;s sisters if they&rsquo;ve ever received an explanation</p>
<p>for the labeling of her murder as a hate crime.</p>
<p>And their answer was gut-wrenching.</p>
<p>When you look at the pattern of attacks against Asian American properties and Asian Americans</p>
<p>in that kind of COVID era, you know, you&rsquo;ll see that there was like a number of crimes</p>
<p>committed against Asian families because of the cultural differences of, you know, not</p>
<p>trusting banks, having cash at home.</p>
<p>There were patterns of Asians that own restaurants to, you know, not be at home because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>working at the restaurant during, you know, long hours.</p>
<p>So is that why we were targeted?</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s one arm of it.</p>
<p>The other is, you know, when you&rsquo;re looking at it as who is the victim here and why did</p>
<p>that person become a victim?</p>
<p>If they were somebody else, would it have escalated to this, to that level?</p>
<p>And so, you know, now we&rsquo;re talking about violence against women as a hate crime.</p>
<p>Race aside, you know, you&rsquo;re looking at an extremely violent crime and the elements of</p>
<p>the crime that occurred, would that have happened if it were a man?</p>
<p>You know, would that have happened if she were not a young woman?</p>
<p>And, you know, what are those elements that allow the crime to get to that level?</p>
<p>You know, in a situation of a burglary, why would you not just kill somebody, but why</p>
<p>would you burn them alive?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s messed up, right?</p>
<p>Wendy Kipple, who is now a sergeant with the sheriff&rsquo;s office, wants nothing more than</p>
<p>to put the assailants behind bars.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s hopeful DNA testing will advance to a point that that is going to be what cracks</p>
<p>this case.</p>
<p>I think eventually technology will get us there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to our DNA analysts down at CBI and they think within a short amount of time,</p>
<p>like two to three years out, maybe sooner, we can hope that technology will get to the</p>
<p>point that we can develop something more from the evidence that we do have.</p>
<p>But so far, we just don&rsquo;t have it, which is frustrating because we don&rsquo;t have anything</p>
<p>else at this point.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have anybody coming forward and saying anything.</p>
<p>Sergeant Kipple told our reporting team that she believes the people who killed Maggie</p>
<p>were not locals.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think that they&rsquo;re from here because if they&rsquo;re locals, somebody&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to start talking.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t keep quiet for five years and not have anybody say anything.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s several guys that are involved in this, why hasn&rsquo;t somebody come forward?</p>
<p>Why hasn&rsquo;t an angry ex-girlfriend or ex-wife or ex-friend say, you know what, I know who</p>
<p>did this and go after them?</p>
<p>But she acknowledges that there are other factors that seem to point to the assailants</p>
<p>being from the area.</p>
<p>Like, how would they have known what house to target?</p>
<p>The Long&rsquo;s place was in a really remote location.</p>
<p>How would out-of-towners have known that the family had large sums of cash stowed away</p>
<p>at home?</p>
<p>These are the questions that keep Sergeant Kipple up at night.</p>
<p>And they gnaw at Lena and Connie too, because they know someone out there holds the answers.</p>
<p>That person just hasn&rsquo;t come forward yet.</p>
<p>You know, definitely been a standstill in the investigation, and we just need people</p>
<p>to, you know, come forward and speak out.</p>
<p>And if the lead doesn&rsquo;t go anywhere, then that&rsquo;s okay, it doesn&rsquo;t go anywhere.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gone through a lot of leads, but we need more to look into in order to make any</p>
<p>progress.</p>
<p>I think just that somebody knows something, and that there were multiple people involved,</p>
<p>and those multiple people have relationships and families and connections.</p>
<p>I hope that, you know, anyone who&rsquo;s listening who has, like, a bad feeling, that they come</p>
<p>forward with it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing to say that those people aren&rsquo;t going to do this again.</p>
<p>To someone else&rsquo;s sister, to someone else&rsquo;s daughter, to someone else&rsquo;s cousin.</p>
<p>So Maggie was, in all of this experience, Maggie was truly innocent.</p>
<p>Maggie was in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
<p>In closing, I want to read something Maggie wrote after one of her classmates passed away.</p>
<p>And after Maggie&rsquo;s death, these words were featured in her school&rsquo;s yearbook to comfort</p>
<p>the people now mourning her loss.</p>
<p>She wrote, quote,</p>
<p>I think the only real cure to cope with loss is to continue to be good people.</p>
<p>Be kind.</p>
<p>Be caring.</p>
<p>Be passionate.</p>
<p>Be thoughtful.</p>
<p>Find the value of the people around you and spread good vibes.</p>
<p>But most importantly, don&rsquo;t limit your boundaries.</p>
<p>Share love and consider everyone around you, from strangers to acquaintances, to peers</p>
<p>to friends.</p>
<p>We all have our circle of close people, but it surely wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to feel the comfort</p>
<p>of everyone on your side.</p>
<p>I think enough people have experienced pain to understand that life is far more measurable</p>
<p>in joy and good memories than to be scorched with cruelty and loss.</p>
