Berg here I have another</p><p>really awesome Skype for you this is</p><p>Shane Jones so welcome Shane exactly</p><p>right</p><p>thanks for doing this hey why don&rsquo;t you</p><p>just dive in and tell us a little bit</p><p>about your story of what happened your</p><p>struggles and then how you kind of</p><p>overcame them over time sure yeah</p><p>so I&rsquo;ve struggled with my weight pretty</p><p>much my entire life I grew up in a</p><p>Filipino household so that meant a lot</p><p>of rice a lot of starches a lot of</p><p>desserts a lot of like sweetly marinated</p><p>meats and I grew up you know learning</p><p>that you know you had to finish</p><p>everything on your plate and so I think</p><p>all of that you know sort of predisposed</p><p>me to gain a weight when I was a kid and</p><p>so I pretty much just gained weight up</p><p>until about high school and I think when</p><p>I hit high school because I became</p><p>involved in a lot of high intensity</p><p>sports</p><p>and a lot of running that the weight</p><p>sort of plateaued and then we as a</p><p>little kid will you ever wait or did you</p><p>start gaining weight like when you got</p><p>into high school no so I&rsquo;ve been gaining</p><p>weight I was big when I was like four or</p><p>five and then I just got bigger until I</p><p>reached high school sort of plateaued</p><p>doing some sports and then it wasn&rsquo;t</p><p>until after college that I started</p><p>ballooning up again when the activity</p><p>sort of dwindled so now do you have any</p><p>brothers and sisters yeah I have you did</p><p>they would they overweight when there</p><p>are five and six too so it&rsquo;s two of us</p><p>are or were two of us were overweight</p><p>when we were kids and then the other two</p><p>were like sort of skinny the whole time</p><p>so it&rsquo;s just kind of half this is</p><p>interesting I&rsquo;m going to talk about this</p><p>because every time you know I talk to</p><p>people that have been overweight their</p><p>whole life I&rsquo;m always interested what</p><p>so can you tell tell me what age was it</p><p>at five or was it at four was it at</p><p>three did you start to notice in your</p><p>pictures you started gaining weight 24</p><p>and that was like about the same with my</p><p>younger my youngest sister - okay so now</p><p>the question is you know it&rsquo;s not normal</p><p>for a little kid to gain weight unless</p><p>there&rsquo;s something that happened was</p><p>there any anything that happened for</p><p>example did you have asthma or any type</p><p>of things were you had that your parents</p><p>gave you medication steroids that before</p><p>that was there anything like that I&rsquo;m</p><p>not sure for me but my youngest sister</p><p>she had asthma and she also takes when</p><p>she she has autism so she took like</p><p>abilify and like just medications that</p><p>made her more lethargic and hungry so I</p><p>think for her her weight gain was much</p><p>more rapid than mine just because she</p><p>had those medications - with anything</p><p>when you were 3 or 4 years old like</p><p>tonsillectomy and sinus issues throat</p><p>infections anything like that oh I got</p><p>my tonsils taken out pretty early but</p><p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it was that early but</p><p>yeah I did get my tonsils taken out when</p><p>I when I was kid okay was there anything</p><p>else that you recall that occurred just</p><p>before you started gaining weight mmm</p><p>not that I can remember okay with other</p><p>people when I interview them</p><p>definitely when they have the tonsils</p><p>removed or have some type of virus or</p><p>something somehow that seems to affect</p><p>the metabolism that can do it as well</p><p>but for you you&rsquo;re not sure but you</p><p>should keep looking at like keep maybe</p><p>ask your parents was there anything that</p><p>happened it would be just interesting to</p><p>find out what one client I had she&rsquo;s</p><p>tried everything to lose weight I&rsquo;m</p><p>talking everything in fact if she</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t eat she doesn&rsquo;t even lose weight</p><p>if she doesn&rsquo;t eat she&rsquo;s done marathons</p><p>triathlons she&rsquo;s tried every diet</p><p>nothing comes off and she&rsquo;s been weight</p><p>overweight her whole life so her husband</p><p>brought her in very skeptical because</p><p>they tried so many things so what I did</p><p>is I worked on her immune system</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t even change her diet I work</p><p>immune system it was the only time in</p><p>her life where she started to finally</p><p>lose weight a little bit each week well</p><p>and then after about six weeks she was</p><p>at about 1.7 pounds lost per week and</p><p>she stayed there for six months like</p><p>obviously so that&rsquo;s just kind of a side</p><p>note for those of you that are watching</p><p>that happened to have been overweight</p><p>your whole life you know you always have</p><p>to look at other things too now getting</p><p>back to your story so you&rsquo;re in high</p><p>school you started becoming more active</p><p>you lost weight and then I guess in</p><p>college you starting anyway yeah so one</p><p>it&rsquo;s funny because after I thought my</p><p>weight sort of would stabilize after</p><p>puberty because that&rsquo;s in high school</p><p>after I went through puberty I was</p><p>normal normal weight and then you know</p><p>as I went through college and you know</p><p>started tapering down on the activity</p><p>and not really paying attention to what</p><p>I was eating it just sort of sort of</p><p>crept up behind me and it wasn&rsquo;t I</p><p>didn&rsquo;t really even notice how big I had</p><p>got until about a year after I graduated</p><p>when I got a physical and I had all</p><p>these like issues with my weight and my</p><p>blood sugar and my blood pressure that</p><p>my doctor told me I should start you</p><p>know paying attention to that it wasn&rsquo;t</p><p>until much after what did you have did</p><p>you have like what kind of conditions</p><p>did they find well so my doctor told me</p><p>that you know I was pre-diabetic and</p><p>that I was pre hypertensive and that she</p><p>wanted to run a lipid panel and check my</p><p>blood glucose and stuff and that they</p><p>were all indicating that I was on the</p><p>track to you know become diabetic and</p><p>hypertensive so I wasn&rsquo;t too surprised</p><p>about the pre-diabetes because my</p><p>they&rsquo;ve run said my dad&rsquo;s had a family</p><p>but I mean it just was kind of weird to</p><p>hear at 23 like I didn&rsquo;t expect that to</p><p>be a thing right and then did you go</p><p>through a lot of stress in college yeah</p><p>that&rsquo;s funny because you mentioned</p><p>stress because I actually the first</p><p>video I stumbled upon of yours was the</p><p>adrenal body type</p><p>and how people this body type manage</p><p>stress and how that affects their weight</p><p>gain and where you gain weight and I</p><p>just like made a lot of sense that you</p><p>know that was a body type that I had but</p><p>yeah I&rsquo;m really prone to stress and I&rsquo;d</p><p>like work it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a process to manage</p><p>it what what did you study in college</p><p>biology biology yeah awesome okay so now</p><p>that you graduated then you started</p><p>becoming more sedentary and you started</p><p>game or weight and then what happened at</p><p>that point yeah so there was there was</p><p>some there&rsquo;s an event with that um one</p><p>of my younger sisters she played</p><p>volleyball and then we had a sort of</p><p>like gathering afterward and there were</p><p>like all these games at the park and</p><p>like I couldn&rsquo;t like my knee my right</p><p>knee gave out and I just felt really</p><p>were like why like I guess I would just</p><p>I haven&rsquo;t been used to running for a</p><p>while and I felt really out of shape and</p><p>I was like maybe it&rsquo;s because of all the</p><p>weight that I&rsquo;ve become sort of my</p><p>mobility is you know taking a turn and</p><p>then so at that point I was I figured I</p><p>should start losing weight because I</p><p>didn&rsquo;t want my mobility to be even more</p><p>hindered by the weight how much did you</p><p>weigh that&rsquo;s when it started what did</p><p>you weigh at that point at your peak to</p><p>44 okay and I&rsquo;ll totally I think are</p><p>anything I&rsquo;m 510 okay and in college I</p><p>weight like that when I was in shape I&rsquo;d</p><p>say like 175 there&rsquo;s no wow yeah and</p><p>where did you hold the weight mainly</p><p>around my gut and my like thighs so just</p><p>kind of in the middle section pretty</p><p>much yeah Wow okay so you&rsquo;re at your</p><p>peak you&rsquo;re over 200 pounds and what</p><p>happened at that point so it was really</p><p>weird because I so throughout my life</p><p>I&rsquo;ve tried lots of different diets per</p><p>se and you know they work to some extent</p><p>and then I gain I&rsquo;m back so I I was</p><p>really worried about going on another</p><p>crash diet</p><p>because I like I knew enough that that</p><p>wasn&rsquo;t gonna be the the solution so I</p><p>wanted some kind of lifestyle change</p><p>that would help me manage my weight and</p><p>I wasn&rsquo;t really concerned with how fast</p><p>or how long it would take to get there</p><p>so the first thing I did was just take</p><p>it easy I tried making easy lifestyle</p><p>changes that would be easy to make so</p><p>then I could make them long-term so you</p><p>know instead of eating out like five or</p><p>six times a week like I was doing cut it</p><p>down so I tried doing that kind of stuff</p><p>and then I stumbled at this point when I</p><p>was doing the lifestyle changes I did</p><p>stumble upon keto but the science made</p><p>sense to me it just there was a fear</p><p>that eating more fat to me because I was</p><p>so big already was not gonna be in my</p><p>best interest so uh it wasn&rsquo;t because</p><p>the science didn&rsquo;t make sense it was</p><p>because I just had a fear that I would</p><p>gain more weight and I was already</p><p>overweight and that would be</p><p>counterproductive to what I wanted so I</p><p>held off on keto for a while</p><p>found intermittent fasting and actually</p><p>did in a minute fasting first just made</p><p>a little bit more sense to me at that</p><p>point lost some weight then after a</p><p>month I kind of stalled and then at that</p><p>point I figured I would try keto and</p><p>keto was really hard for me it took me</p><p>probably like two or three weeks to</p><p>fully have every all the meals in my day</p><p>to be keto I felt like my body just</p><p>really needed the carbs all the time so</p><p>I had to wean myself off took a while</p><p>Wow so did you so you started working</p><p>this out and then at that point did you</p><p>find my videos or was it after that you</p><p>found no yes so I found your vid I found</p><p>your videos before and I didn&rsquo;t start</p><p>doing keto until intermittent fasting</p><p>sort of plateaued me if that makes sense</p><p>yeah so then I try Tito and I&rsquo;ve been on</p><p>keto since so it&rsquo;s been like six seven</p><p>months Wow yeah and so here you&rsquo;re on</p><p>keto you&rsquo;re combining them and then you</p><p>finally kind of</p><p>[Music]</p><p>got used to it and we will you then like</p><p>you&rsquo;re eating obviously a little bit</p><p>more fat because you had to replace with</p><p>something and then do did you find that</p><p>you started were you surprised in any</p><p>way that eating more fat would help you</p><p>lose weight</p><p>yeah so I think what I was scared scared</p><p>was is that you know fat it has more</p><p>calorie content so I was eating like the</p><p>same amount of meals with more fat I</p><p>would just be eating more calories and</p><p>like my whole equation would be off but</p><p>after you know after you eat a keto meal</p><p>like you&rsquo;re not hungry for a long period</p><p>of time so it ended up not being that</p><p>much of a factor so and so that&rsquo;s what I</p><p>was most surprised about so do you so</p><p>tell me how the weight started coming</p><p>off what did it come off gradually right</p><p>so I think once I hit once I started</p><p>keto the weight came down it was like</p><p>kind of fast like in a downward slope</p><p>and now it&rsquo;s pretty gradual like staying</p><p>at the same point so I think the first</p><p>month I did keto I dropped like 15</p><p>pounds and then after that it&rsquo;s been</p><p>pretty steady in - and right now I&rsquo;m</p><p>just kind of maintaining where I&rsquo;m at</p><p>and what do you weigh right now right</p><p>now like 188 Wow that&rsquo;s awesome</p><p>do you want to lose any more are you</p><p>happy with where you&rsquo;re at um I&rsquo;m pretty</p><p>happy where I&rsquo;m at like all of the</p><p>markers that you know the triglycerides</p><p>and high blood pressure and everything</p><p>is in normal ranges now so that that was</p><p>my main goal and I think the best part</p><p>about keto is that it doesn&rsquo;t feel like</p><p>a diet to me at this point it&rsquo;s more</p><p>like a lifestyle so I mean I&rsquo;m happy</p><p>where I&rsquo;m at I have no health to need to</p><p>get any lower but so that so doing a pre</p><p>diabetic thing all that stuff is</p><p>improved yeah yeah so I think my trick</p><p>was starts before we&rsquo;re like close a</p><p>little bit over a hundred and now</p><p>they&rsquo;re in the 70s my blood pressure was</p><p>like 135 over</p><p>five now it&rsquo;s like 120 over 80</p><p>so every all the markets are pretty much</p><p>improved that&rsquo;s awesome and then what</p><p>was your - you were into biology but</p><p>what was your actual degree - you</p><p>specialize in toxicology okay yes like</p><p>the environment and how toxins play a</p><p>role interesting I&rsquo;ll have to talk to</p><p>you later right now but the the question</p><p>so you must have taken you you had to</p><p>have taken a lot of different courses</p><p>probably on body physiology right would</p><p>you have to go into that so you probably</p><p>were indoctrinated or just basically</p><p>taught that its calories calories in</p><p>calories out is that been kinetic yeah</p><p>yeah and you know it took me a long time</p><p>to switch my thinking from you know this</p><p>caloric you know issue to a hormone</p><p>issue look at that that was like the</p><p>biggest like once that hit it made a lot</p><p>more sense to me but it took me a long</p><p>time to buy into that right especially</p><p>since bad has the most calories per gram</p><p>so you know octo you&rsquo;re gonna eat fat</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna gain weight so so looking</p><p>back now that you have this data looking</p><p>back at it where you were before</p><p>what are what are some of the what&rsquo;s the</p><p>number one key thing that you didn&rsquo;t</p><p>really get or understand back then that</p><p>now you understand that&rsquo;s like the mist</p><p>that was the missing link for you it&rsquo;s</p><p>just as far as the physiology point yeah</p><p>so I think the biggest thing for me was</p><p>that eating fat would help promote you</p><p>know fat loss and that it would in the</p><p>sense that it wouldn&rsquo;t trigger as much</p><p>of an insulin spike I just I just missed</p><p>the whole endocrinology part of it all</p><p>and I was too focused on you know the</p><p>equation of energy and versus energy out</p><p>and now I feel so I feel a little bit</p><p>dumb talking about it because it makes</p><p>so much sense to me now</p><p>but that was the biggest part for me</p><p>well it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not even your father&rsquo;s</p><p>just of the whole schooling system and</p><p>all the universities including the the</p><p>grad school that I went to and the</p><p>pre-med school is all it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s</p><p>filled with false data and they don&rsquo;t</p><p>connect the dots between physiology</p><p>anatomy and metabolism it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s kind of</p><p>all separate and people are just fed</p><p>this data but it&rsquo;s you don&rsquo;t have a</p><p>chance to apply it to see if it&rsquo;s true</p><p>or not so a lot of stuff you learn isn&rsquo;t</p><p>you don&rsquo;t even know if it&rsquo;s true or you</p><p>just have to pass the test and get</p><p>through it get your decay and like wow</p><p>okay you don&rsquo;t know if it works or not</p><p>but yeah I I had to go back and re study</p><p>it from a different viewpoint to see</p><p>okay let me just forget everything that</p><p>I learned let&rsquo;s does this really work</p><p>okay yeah that works this doesn&rsquo;t work</p><p>but yeah that&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s missing</p><p>I think is the workability the</p><p>application of these basic things</p><p>especially when it comes down to the</p><p>endocrine system and insulin I mean even</p><p>in look a lot of my friends who are</p><p>medical doctors they same thing they</p><p>don&rsquo;t they don&rsquo;t have the basic data on</p><p>insulin in fact it&rsquo;s almost scary to</p><p>know even some of the endocrinologists</p><p>don&rsquo;t even understand endocrinology that</p><p>well i&rsquo;ve talked to some of them and</p><p>they don&rsquo;t didn&rsquo;t really connect the</p><p>dots with insulin being you know the</p><p>main fat making hormone all it&rsquo;s not</p><p>even in their in their space that&rsquo;s</p><p>pretty weird</p><p>so yeah so shifting gears to toxicology</p><p>like I&rsquo;m just curious like here you are</p><p>you got into toxicology did they cover a</p><p>lot of like data on endocrine disrupters</p><p>when you were in school was that yeah we</p><p>had we had sections on that mainly was</p><p>it was issues with pollutants in the air</p><p>and how that can affect populations of</p><p>people but also the environment and life</p><p>so and did they cover any data about</p><p>phase 1 phase 2 detoxification the liver</p><p>with the set of cytochrome for 50p</p><p>hormone I mean the enzymes and all the</p><p>different detoxification systems in the</p><p>liver to help detoxify do they get into</p><p>that very much yeah I&rsquo;m like when you</p><p>said cytochrome p450 like I immediately</p><p>recognize the name if I were to try to</p><p>recall what you know that process is I</p><p>probably can</p><p>do it on top of my head so is this kind</p><p>of like it was the data but they didn&rsquo;t</p><p>really give you systems to go hey here</p><p>are the foods that you should be eating</p><p>these probably didn&rsquo;t get into that oh</p><p>no no it was much more you know these</p><p>are this is what happens in the liver</p><p>when toxins you know come in nothing</p><p>related really to nutrition and how that</p><p>impacts the whole system because there&rsquo;s</p><p>a disconnect between toxicology and just</p><p>general medicine there&rsquo;s not there&rsquo;s a</p><p>complete disconnect they don&rsquo;t connect</p><p>it and then the last question is did</p><p>they cover glyphosate herbicide in GMO</p><p>foods and all that they do they talk</p><p>about that or oh yeah we had section on</p><p>on GMOs and the use of herbicides and</p><p>pesticides and there I think when I</p><p>learned it it&rsquo;s it was still a big</p><p>debate sort of what was going on so what</p><p>we did was mainly read different papers</p><p>and sort of debate between each other</p><p>yeah yeah because right now I think I</p><p>don&rsquo;t know if you heard about the</p><p>class-action suit that the the attorney</p><p>no the judge actually released the</p><p>papers and on this case and it&rsquo;s</p><p>interesting because the apparently there</p><p>was ghost riders that were writing the</p><p>articles kind of fudging the research</p><p>and you know Nene you&rsquo;re so political</p><p>they put it out there in the</p><p>universities and then you don&rsquo;t really</p><p>get the truth on that so that&rsquo;s probably</p><p>why I didn&rsquo;t really hurt hear a lot</p><p>about it but anyway getting back to you</p><p>this is awesome but you did really well</p><p>are you adding exercise into your</p><p>program at all yeah yeah so right now I</p><p>worked out uniforms a week weight</p><p>training mainly I walk but I don&rsquo;t do a</p><p>ton of like kind at City cardio or</p><p>anything great</p><p>and then what tell me what how many</p><p>meals that you have a day one wow that&rsquo;s</p><p>awesome yeah but I I my window is about</p><p>four hours so I have a meal I can&rsquo;t like</p><p>scarf it all down like thirty minutes so</p><p>I kind of graze a little bit for a</p><p>couple hours but yeah just one it&rsquo;s</p><p>totally fine and then</p><p>tell me what you eat so it&rsquo;s a lot of</p><p>leafy greens and a lot of chicken but</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with using like</p><p>cauliflower and turning that into like a</p><p>dough for pizza and stuff it just I feel</p><p>like there&rsquo;s a lot of options out there</p><p>but I&rsquo;m just like a person of habit so</p><p>I&rsquo;ll get a bunch of greens and then I&rsquo;ll</p><p>put like apple cider vinegar with some</p><p>mustard and some salt and pepper and</p><p>just kind of be happy with that so</p><p>that&rsquo;s great that&rsquo;s awesome Shane I</p><p>think you&rsquo;ve done really well and I</p><p>think pretty much almost every single</p><p>one of my Skype interview so far</p><p>everyone has been on a one meal a day</p><p>which is kind of surprising but I think</p><p>it&rsquo;s as you do this all of a sudden it&rsquo;s</p><p>like you&rsquo;re not your hunger goes away</p><p>and you&rsquo;re like I&rsquo;m not really that</p><p>hungry and you&rsquo;re satisfied so I find</p><p>even people that are almost if they eat</p><p>too much they feel nauseous it&rsquo;s like</p><p>it&rsquo;s just like okay I don&rsquo;t really need</p><p>that so yeah yeah so there has to be a</p><p>point where you know you get all your</p><p>nutrients in in your one meal so guys</p><p>take it in yeah that&rsquo;s right well this</p><p>is awesome Shane thank you so much for</p><p>the interview I think it&rsquo;s gonna help</p><p>other people just to get another</p><p>viewpoint of what to do okay so this is</p><p>yeah thanks for calling and have a</p><p>wonderful afternoon eat you okay see ya</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section
