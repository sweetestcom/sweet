<p>that question so you&rsquo;re doing something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s finally getting getting you</p>
<p>energy and you&rsquo;re successful and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>awesome and that&rsquo;s gonna eventually help</p>
<p>you with a lot of things because the</p>
<p>high sugar the high insulin does</p>
<p>increase the growth of fibroids so if</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do the great cruciferous</p>
<p>vegetables because it blows to you you</p>
<p>can do fermented vegetables but here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the thing I would do seek out iodine in</p>
<p>the sea cow</p>
<p>is anti estrogenic it&rsquo;s really good for</p>
<p>fibrocystic breasts it&rsquo;s good for</p>
<p>endometriosis it&rsquo;s great for tumors in</p>
<p>general and fibroids which is the tumor</p>
<p>so go ahead and use that get a high</p>
<p>quality seek help and see if it can help</p>
<p>you all right but keep everything else</p>
<p>the same good question</p>
<p>okay Brooke you&rsquo;re from Tennessee you</p>
<p>had a question about fasting</p>
<p>administration go ahead I have been</p>
<p>doing keto and the last couple of months</p>
<p>I have had trouble not having my period</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have it on time last month and</p>
<p>then I ended up increasing like starchy</p>
<p>vegetables and fruit and it came back</p>
<p>later but this month I was need to have</p>
<p>it on the first and I haven&rsquo;t had it at</p>
<p>all and I&rsquo;m just wondering should I not</p>
<p>be doing fasting or should I increase</p>
<p>those starchy vegetables and stuff to</p>
<p>get my period back so so the thing that</p>
<p>I want to really kind of understand is</p>
<p>that you are doing fine and then you</p>
<p>started him in a fasting keto and then</p>
<p>you you lost your period is that what</p>
<p>happened yeah okay here&rsquo;s the thing that</p>
<p>I would do in this situation when you</p>
<p>have any side effects any side effects</p>
<p>at all whether it&rsquo;s hair loss fatigue a</p>
<p>keto rash infertility a loss of I mean a</p>
<p>loss of a period all that means is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just you need to go up with your</p>
<p>nutrients probably going to need more B</p>
<p>vitamins probably gonna need more</p>
<p>minerals and also some of the essential</p>
<p>fatty acids so I think that what you</p>
<p>need to focus on is enhancing your diet</p>
<p>with more new</p>
<p>means because so many women actually do</p>
<p>this and they actually start the cycle</p>
<p>becomes less intense and things like</p>
<p>that and so it&rsquo;s better so in this</p>
<p>situation all you need to do is just</p>
<p>kind of add more the nutrients that you</p>
<p>might be missing I would do trace</p>
<p>minerals I would do fat soluble vitamins</p>
<p>I would do the B vitamins especially and</p>
<p>try that I think that will actually help</p>
<p>you more than anything else because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically just getting your</p>
<p>hormones back in alignment and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking this dominant hormone and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dropping it okay try that and let us</p>
<p>know how that works all right Carol</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Dallas Texas you had a</p>
<p>question about liquids during fasting go</p>
<p>ahead yes the information you provide is</p>
<p>so valuable and I so much appreciate it</p>
<p>because it has helped me tremendously I</p>
<p>have a question I started that keto diet</p>
<p>Santo area this year lost about eight</p>
<p>pounds way that&rsquo;s currently 147 and I</p>
<p>started in a minute fasting in June of</p>
<p>this year started with two meals no</p>
<p>snacking down to one meal and a half</p>
<p>again and have haven&rsquo;t lost anything</p>
<p>really since June I do a raw kale</p>
<p>vegetable shake in the morning around 6</p>
<p>a.m. with half a teaspoon of MCT oil</p>
<p>collagen powder and colostrum and then I</p>
<p>have my first meal around 11:30 a.m. and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a huge salad with the fish no more</p>
<p>than 6 ounces a couple of eggs cheese</p>
<p>even I commit my own vegetables and then</p>
<p>I have like two ounces of people that I</p>
<p>make at home very nutritional and then I</p>
<p>have a side of raw vegetables that I mix</p>
<p>in my side of mixer and then at</p>
<p>five-thirty p.m. I have just a handful</p>
<p>of nuts and of course I soak them and</p>
<p>dehydrate them walnuts pecans</p>
<p>even I commit my own vegetables and then</p>
<p>I have like two ounces of people that I</p>
<p>make at home well it sounds like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing great and then you have oh and</p>
<p>doctor and dr. burr got as soon as she</p>
<p>would it was a lot of feedback and I</p>
<p>want to lose five more pounds and I do</p>
<p>incorporate apple cider vinegar and</p>
<p>lemon and I do have a half hypothyroid</p>
<p>my a 1/3 was six point two now it&rsquo;s five</p>
<p>point nine it&rsquo;s definitely going down my</p>
<p>eyebrows were going back I feel good I</p>
<p>use every one of your supplements except</p>
<p>the coast of consistent because I eat so</p>
<p>make up so much wild vegetable and I no</p>
<p>longer have any sugar cravings I may</p>
<p>have a cookie or two at the end of my</p>
<p>meal just I don&rsquo;t and I could just stop</p>
<p>I could just stop eating the cookies</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>sugar craving whatsoever the question I</p>
<p>have a question for you girl are those</p>
<p>cookies filled with sugar or no no the</p>
<p>cookies I have is your shortbread okay</p>
<p>oh my like three inches but I mean just</p>
<p>you just kind there&rsquo;s a lot of callers</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to get to this question</p>
<p>okay you&rsquo;re doing so many things right</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s working and we just want to</p>
<p>speed it up and you&rsquo;re probably maybe</p>
<p>add a little bit of a plateau but you</p>
<p>still have a little bit more to go so</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m gonna recommend is two things</p>
<p>one is because everything is working</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t change too many things maybe not</p>
<p>do two cookies maybe do you like us one</p>
<p>cookie with one of the meals not with</p>
<p>each one and then what I would do is</p>
<p>that would start pushing that first meal</p>
<p>closer in to later and later in the day</p>
<p>just a little bit and then taking the</p>
<p>second meal and pushing that back an</p>
<p>hour and I think just that alone will</p>
<p>just boost you because then that way</p>
<p>will give us more chance for your body</p>
<p>to Lawrence</p>
<p>and really heal the insulin and give you</p>
<p>the unfair advantage of enjoying the</p>
<p>food having two meals and then really</p>
<p>losing the weight a lot of people end up</p>
<p>dropping that last meal out so you</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another thing you can kind of</p>
<p>look at doing but I think you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>great Carol don&rsquo;t change too many things</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s working give it more time and I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll lose that last pound</p>
<p>and the reason I&rsquo;m just kind of cutting</p>
<p>off a little faster because we just have</p>
<p>a million callers just waiting so and</p>
<p>Karen did we have any questions from any</p>
<p>of the Facebook people out there</p>
<p>Facebook YouTube social media we have a</p>
<p>million questions already there are so</p>
<p>many great ones but here&rsquo;s a simple one</p>
<p>what are your thoughts on stevia okay so</p>
<p>number one stevia is probably the best</p>
<p>sweetener out there because it does not</p>
<p>affect blood sugars at all it&rsquo;s an herb</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some false information out</p>
<p>there that says that oh yeah stevia is</p>
<p>going to cause this and that it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>true but here&rsquo;s the catch 22 when you</p>
<p>actually buy stevia look on the back of</p>
<p>the label and make sure they don&rsquo;t add</p>
<p>multiple decks Trent there is one thing</p>
<p>that I haven&rsquo;t recommended on one of the</p>
<p>shows and I can&rsquo;t remember the brand but</p>
<p>it had hidden multi-gesture and someone</p>
<p>brought it to my attention so just read</p>
<p>the label if it just has regular stevia</p>
<p>in a liquid form or just the powder form</p>
<p>totally fine you can have as as much as</p>
<p>you want and it&rsquo;s not going to affect</p>
<p>your blood sugars the problem is it kind</p>
<p>of gives a little aftertaste so you some</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t like it monk fruit is a</p>
<p>little bit better a little more pricey</p>
<p>but go ahead and keep doing stevia</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a problem</p>
<p>hey Arlene you&rsquo;re from Delaware you two</p>
<p>question yes how are you doctor great</p>
<p>thanks good I have a question about what</p>
<p>should my husband do he has myself I am</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking a sleep aid medication I love</p>
<p>formula and sweet and I&rsquo;m taking two now</p>
<p>and it just seems like it doesn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>cheat me</p>
<p>we you know keep me sleep so I was</p>
<p>wondering about that and I also had some</p>
<p>blood work but I really can&rsquo;t find the</p>
<p>the paper to ask you a question about it</p>
<p>but anyway I&rsquo;ll actually okay great</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk about your husband first is</p>
<p>he in your diet</p>
<p>okay okay great</p>
<p>let me ask you about your husband is he</p>
<p>on the same eating plan with keto and in</p>
<p>a minute fasting he&rsquo;s going he does the</p>
<p>n-terminus fasting but he&rsquo;s not really</p>
<p>doing the keto because he likes to start</p>
<p>okay got it</p>
<p>alright so let&rsquo;s just kind of cover this</p>
<p>and then before but I just had one more</p>
<p>question before I mute you and then</p>
<p>answer the question do you are you doing</p>
<p>the keto very clean yes and and and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>having setback - I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because of stress or what but I do deal</p>
<p>with the constipation sometimes I only</p>
<p>eat like once a day but I do not eat the</p>
<p>starches I eat vegetable okay great</p>
<p>alright so let&rsquo;s talk about your husband</p>
<p>first really what kills testosterone is</p>
<ul>
<li>two hormones actually three hormones</li>
</ul>
<p>one is estrogen and that&rsquo;s in a lot of</p>
<p>the food supply unless he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>organic so that is one alright so if he</p>
<p>starts doing organic that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>help them greatly especially the GMO</p>
<p>non-gmo which would be of organic</p>
<p>secondly is the insulin insulin if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>spiked that&rsquo;ll shut down testosterone so</p>
<p>if he does the Kido I I would bet</p>
<p>anything it&rsquo;s gonna really improve</p>
<p>things for him because the Kido by</p>
<p>keeping the diet clean of sugars and in</p>
<p>a minute fasting together I mean he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna do very well make sure his</p>
<p>workouts are heavier weights higher</p>
<p>intensity full body that will also</p>
<p>increase testosterone sleep will</p>
<p>increase testosterone but I think really</p>
<p>what he needs to do is bite the bullet</p>
<p>and do the Kido within a minute fasting</p>
<p>and that that problem will be improved</p>
<p>now for you</p>
<p>sounds like you have some stress</p>
<p>and you have constipation so this leap</p>
<p>aid works like all great percentage of</p>
<p>the time but sometimes you need to pull</p>
<p>out the physical stress there&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>massage tool that I have with a little</p>
<p>instruction of how with videos online</p>
<p>you can find them but that actually</p>
<p>allows you to pull all the stress out of</p>
<p>your body and I do this</p>
<p>this technique every night before I go</p>
<p>to bed right Karen yes a massage tool</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like I&rsquo;m using that thing everything</p>
<p>like Karen&rsquo;s like would you massage my</p>
<p>back I&rsquo;m like well I&rsquo;m not done yet with</p>
<p>my own body so I have these different</p>
<p>techniques that you&rsquo;re doing acupressure</p>
<p>to yourself and it does it helped me go</p>
<p>to sleep Karen apparently yeah within a</p>
<p>few minutes I&rsquo;m just like he&rsquo;s asleep so</p>
<p>I would use the massage tool and then if</p>
<p>you have constipation one of the things</p>
<p>that you might want to try is do more</p>
<p>kale shakes because that seems to</p>
<p>actually have the potassium things to</p>
<p>kind of loosen things up and then as</p>
<p>well as the electrolyte formula that</p>
<p>that would help things be more regulated</p>
<p>because potassium helps regulate the</p>
<p>pumping action of the colon</p>
<p>all right good question hey Mike you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from Florida you&rsquo;d a question about</p>
<p>gallbladder attacks and gout when you</p>
<p>started Aikido yeah I have kind of a I</p>
<p>guess it&rsquo;s kind of a good news/bad news</p>
<p>situation I started losing weight about</p>
<p>seven weeks ago I&rsquo;m 46 years old and I</p>
<p>was about eighty pounds overweight lost</p>
<p>about 26 pounds so far and I last four</p>
<p>weeks of that has been keto and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been really tasteful to that so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the good side of things but the problem</p>
<p>is about right after I started eating</p>
<p>healthier but before I got on to keto I</p>
<p>got hit with a gallbladder attack and it</p>
<p>was the first time that had ever</p>
<p>happened and went into a specialist and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re suggesting that I&rsquo;ve got enough</p>
<p>stones that I really should have it</p>
<p>removed I haven&rsquo;t done that yet and then</p>
<p>subsequently I&rsquo;ve gotten hit with a</p>
<p>series of major gout attacks I&rsquo;ve had it</p>
<p>in both feet both ankles and my left</p>
<p>knee I&rsquo;ve kind of learned just through</p>
<p>some research that it could be related</p>
<p>and so I guess there&rsquo;s two things I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>kind of on the fence about one is</p>
<p>lowering uric acid either somehow</p>
<p>naturally or by getting on to your</p>
<p>allopurinol and then also trying to you</p>
<p>know trying to save this gall bladder or</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s kind of a lost cause yeah</p>
<p>good question now anything that I tell</p>
<p>you on the show tell anyone is just for</p>
<p>educational or research purposes or</p>
<p>entertainment and so it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>necessarily meant to diagnose you or</p>
<p>tell you to do something without your</p>
<p>doctor&rsquo;s approval so that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>disclaimer but here&rsquo;s my opinion gall</p>
<p>stones develop because usually a lack of</p>
<p>bile be il e combined with higher</p>
<p>insulin combined with higher cortisol so</p>
<p>taking a bile salt or a gall bladder</p>
<p>formula would be very very beneficial to</p>
<p>help that I don&rsquo;t know how many stones</p>
<p>you have I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s too far</p>
<p>gone I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>your state but just in general the fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing keto is great do</p>
<p>intermittent fasting which you might</p>
<p>already be doing because that&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>actually help increase more bile and</p>
<p>help the dissolving of the stones so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one thing</p>
<p>combined with a lot of the greens and</p>
<p>the vegetables which will offset allow</p>
<p>this cholesterol that&rsquo;s coming out</p>
<p>through the liver as you&rsquo;re losing</p>
<p>weight now as far as the gout goes this</p>
<p>is another complication of keto with if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re prone to it because what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening and it&rsquo;s not necessarily just</p>
<p>a lot of protein which a lot of people</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s God only comes from high</p>
<p>protein but when you&rsquo;re doing the</p>
<p>transition from kedo from circa burning</p>
<p>to fat burning the uric acid levels do</p>
<p>go up and that could lead to gout or</p>
<p>uric acid kidney stones so what do you</p>
<p>do what I would do is get some</p>
<p>high-quality organic lemon juice and</p>
<p>with every glass of liquid put about two</p>
<p>ounces of lemon juice drink with the</p>
<p>straw started doing that a lot the other</p>
<p>thing that you want to do is you do want</p>
<p>to keep your vegetables very very very</p>
<p>high which will then give you the</p>
<p>potassium</p>
<p>potassium is an alkalizer potassium</p>
<p>helps to counter the effect of gout</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s in a potassium</p>
<p>citrate form my electrolyte powder has a</p>
<p>thousand milligrams of potassium citrate</p>
<p>in the form that would be really good</p>
<p>for you so and pluses all the other</p>
<p>minerals so that might be a good option</p>
<p>but as long as you&rsquo;re doing a lot of</p>
<p>potassium citrate with the vegetables</p>
<p>and additional lemon juice I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be totally fine so I would</p>
<p>do that and to kind of counteract some</p>
<p>of the things and just make sure your</p>
<p>protein is between three and six ounces</p>
<p>okay Mike good question Karen do you</p>
<p>have any other questions from Facebook</p>
<p>coming in - there&rsquo;s so many great</p>
<p>questions I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m having trouble</p>
<p>figuring out which one and trying to</p>
<p>cram 20 of them into one question for</p>
<p>you can you give me the one question</p>
<p>that summarizes like all of them I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying I&rsquo;m actually trying to do that</p>
<p>right now but there is this concept</p>
<p>coming through several questions what do</p>
<p>you think about a cheat day mm-hmm and</p>
<p>the concept of moderation a lot of</p>
<p>people fighting for their right you know</p>
<p>to have that whatever good question so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like in a marriage would</p>
<p>your spouse allow a cheat day I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think so right Karen so that would be</p>
<p>really really bad so the thing with I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know who came up with this idea of</p>
<p>like a cheat day with eating because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>in like it&rsquo;s not on my program it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>in any of my books instead of a cheat</p>
<p>day why don&rsquo;t you make some alternative</p>
<p>healthy pleasure foods there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>recipes that we have did you go online</p>
<p>doctor bird comm watch these recipes and</p>
<p>you can make cookies you could have all</p>
<p>the junk foods that you like and with</p>
<p>good ingredients and that could be your</p>
<p>cheat day why do I say that because when</p>
<p>you go off the program you&rsquo;re basically</p>
<p>adding sugar and carbs that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>spike the insulin enough to bump you out</p>
<p>of that burning for 72 48 to 72 hours so</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re willing to not burn fat</p>
<p>for two to three days after your cheat</p>
<p>day and no ketosis then go for it but</p>
<p>just go into it with full awareness that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to affect your fat burning</p>
<p>and your ability getting ketosis now as</p>
<p>far as this whole thing of moderation I</p>
<p>mean I did that recently did a video on</p>
<p>sugar fructose I think and then someone</p>
<p>commented like I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t agree</p>
<p>because I think everything in moderation</p>
<p>bla bla bla bla bla you know as long as</p>
<p>you do the moderation well when you</p>
<p>actually I says well what&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>definition of moderation it&rsquo;s just it</p>
<p>allows to open the door for a little way</p>
<p>too much moderation think about what a</p>
<p>normal blood sugar is it&rsquo;s like 100 what</p>
<p>is that that&rsquo;s like one teaspoon for all</p>
<p>of your your body&rsquo;s blood well according</p>
<p>to a moderation you could do up to like</p>
<p>six teaspoons a day like that&rsquo;s way too</p>
<p>much so it&rsquo;s bad advice especially when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to burn fat and fix and</p>
<p>heal the body when you get to the state</p>
<p>where your body&rsquo;s in such a state of</p>
<p>health where you have an energy you have</p>
<p>a health reserve you can afford to go</p>
<p>off the program because now you can fall</p>
<p>back in the reserve but most people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get into that state so that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>viewpoint of moderation Karen and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sticking to it</p>
<p>good someone said it&rsquo;s not a cheat day</p>
<p>just a cheat meal okay well try it out</p>
<p>and see how see if see if you can get</p>
<p>away with it and see how your weight</p>
<p>loss is affected but I&rsquo;ll tell you like</p>
<p>a lot of people will come out to me says</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not losing weight I find out they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing cheat date too frequently so it</p>
<p>really depends on your goals and how you</p>
<p>if you want to create your health I I</p>
<p>pretty much got into a state where I eat</p>
<p>to live which is the new concept and I</p>
<p>get a lot of pleasure from food but some</p>
<p>people need that cheat day apparently so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna take a question from crystal</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from North Carolina you had a</p>
<p>question go ahead yes my question is in</p>
<p>regard to inconsistent bowel movements</p>
<p>in one dakedo I have been doing keto</p>
<p>since August and I have</p>
<p>awesome results Thank You dr. Berg but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little concerned as to if I need</p>
<p>to maybe start your gallbladder</p>
<p>supplement to help out with that</p>
<p>inconsistency good question do you have</p>
<p>any problem with right shoulder pain</p>
<p>headaches or anything goes up into the</p>
<p>right side of your head or shoulder um</p>
<p>no I have not experienced just recently</p>
<p>I started just a little with headaches</p>
<p>and I have just assumed it&rsquo;s because I</p>
<p>have been drinking more water just plain</p>
<p>water versus what I normally do is like</p>
<p>lemon water or you know water with a</p>
<p>little salt in it okay do you still have</p>
<p>any cravings for sugars or carbs no not</p>
<p>at all okay good so I think yeah I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking more gallbladder support would</p>
<p>be good because gallbladder as the bile</p>
<p>and helps to lubricate the colon that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one thought the other thing is the</p>
<p>potassium from the electrolytes that is</p>
<p>really good to help keep you regular and</p>
<p>I mean it has magnesium in it potassium</p>
<p>and all the electrolytes so it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>a toss-up so one of the two would be</p>
<p>good for you but yeah when you start</p>
<p>going in keto you need to start to</p>
<p>increase certain nutrients potassium is</p>
<p>the big one minerals and then the B</p>
<p>vitamins and of course the gallbladder</p>
<p>is not a bad idea too especially if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing more fats thanks crystal</p>
<p>all right do we have any do have some</p>
<p>good questions coming in yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really cool because as you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>people are constantly responding to what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying and so we&rsquo;re getting a</p>
<p>handful of people who are saying wait I</p>
<p>have right shoulder pain I have pain on</p>
<p>my right side what&rsquo;s that all about</p>
<p>okay so here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s the symptoms of</p>
<p>gallbladder and I&rsquo;m gonna actually I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>already down within a gallbladder</p>
<p>booklet that I&rsquo;m gonna put out but the</p>
<p>gallbladder is a sac that sits</p>
<p>underneath the right ribcage and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>connected to this thing called the liver</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little tube that comes down</p>
<p>and then what happens the liver makes</p>
<p>this thing called bile bile helps you</p>
<p>break down the grease or the fats so it</p>
<p>the gallbladder stores bile and it</p>
<p>concentrates bile</p>
<p>so when you eat it</p>
<p>tracks and helps you digest the fats why</p>
<p>do you need to digest fats because you</p>
<p>need them in a cell you didn&rsquo;t put</p>
<p>hormone and you need the fat soluble</p>
<p>vitamins vitamin A for the eyes d kk2</p>
<p>for the bones and calcium metabolism so</p>
<p>you can see it has really broad effects</p>
<p>so what was my question again Karen</p>
<p>right like when you start talking and be</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re sowing it full circle lately</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>memory loss no I was but the right side</p>
<p>of your neck and shoulder and even into</p>
<p>your right arm or anything on the right</p>
<p>side it&rsquo;s usually stemming from the</p>
<p>gallbladder and the way that you can</p>
<p>know that is go ahead and massage</p>
<p>underneath your right ribcage about one</p>
<p>inch down over to the right off the</p>
<p>midline and just press that for like 30</p>
<p>seconds and see if those those symptoms</p>
<p>have banished if they have there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>connection because there&rsquo;s a nerve</p>
<p>called the phrenic nerve that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>connected from the gallbladder all the</p>
<p>way up to the right shoulder because</p>
<p>when you step on a dog&rsquo;s tail he barks</p>
<p>through his mouth right okay so the hip</p>
<p>bones connected to the phrenic nerve oh</p>
<p>yeah so everything&rsquo;s connected so you</p>
<p>have to really understand the</p>
<p>relationship all this right shoulder</p>
<p>stuff which I had for 12 years I had no</p>
<p>clue it was coming from our gallbladder</p>
<p>so but when you go on the keto and in a</p>
<p>minute fasting correctly with all the</p>
<p>vegetables the gallbladder is now happy</p>
<p>and a lot of those symptoms go away so</p>
<p>just realize that if you get massages on</p>
<p>that right upper shoulder blade thing</p>
<p>and then your neck and it&rsquo;s not going</p>
<p>away</p>
<p>check the gallbladder I want to make a</p>
<p>point yeah go ahead so some people are</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;re talking about cheat day</p>
<p>and Thanksgivings coming up and how okay</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have a cheat day on</p>
<p>Thanksgiving and you know dr. Berg lives</p>
<p>to eat I don&rsquo;t I mean he eats to live</p>
<p>right right I don&rsquo;t live to eat but I am</p>
<p>nowhere near as disciplined as he is I</p>
<p>have to work on it all the time but we</p>
<p>have some recipes that are really going</p>
<p>to push us through Thanksgiving</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all on the site there&rsquo;s the most</p>
<p>amazing pecan pie</p>
<p>there are biscuits there&rsquo;s candy there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cranberry cranberry sauce which I might</p>
<p>not have on maybe I&rsquo;ll do that one maybe</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do that one today there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all kinds of things so it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>gradient rate you might not have it</p>
<p>totally as dr. Burke says clean</p>
<p>Thanksgiving dinner but there are so</p>
<p>many things that you can have and not at</p>
<p>all feel like you&rsquo;re cheating and still</p>
<p>be in Quito well I just want to say that</p>
<p>well the problem with Karen issues a</p>
<p>good cook really good and she&rsquo;ll make</p>
<p>this pecan pie it&rsquo;s highly addictive and</p>
<p>he eats it all and you you just can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stop eating it because it&rsquo;s just no I do</p>
<p>think about it but that&rsquo;s the promise do</p>
<p>you make it too good so if you made it</p>
<p>halfway good maybe we know the point the</p>
<p>point is that for Thanksgiving there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>couple things one instead of the mashed</p>
<p>potatoes you can do the cauliflower</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of different things that</p>
<p>you can do but this is what I would this</p>
<p>is my tip of the day Karen for a</p>
<p>Thanksgiving now ready for this I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>ready make a note okay here&rsquo;s the tip of</p>
<p>the day why don&rsquo;t you just turn</p>
<p>Thanksgiving into an in a minute fasting</p>
<p>day where you eat one meal okay so in</p>
<p>other words don&rsquo;t eat anything in the</p>
<p>morning I have that one Thanksgiving</p>
<p>meal and go ahead and do what you need</p>
<p>to do and go right back on your program</p>
<p>because at least that you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>stimulating in insulin as much and you</p>
<p>can like have this big meal okay just</p>
<p>the tip Karen just a tip I&rsquo;m picking up</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re throwing down good so so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s rough are you saying are you saying</p>
<p>now you can cheat</p>
<p>what do you I didn&rsquo;t say cheap you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just have one big lied that big huge I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to have people here say Dan if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna cheat eat less frequent</p>
<p>because I know not everyone is gonna be</p>
<p>as perfect a hundred percent of time as</p>
<p>you like me right okay but hey in our</p>
<p>house pecan pie and cabbies if that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t feel like cheating I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what does</p>
<p>right so it&rsquo;s Roth I from Toronto you</p>
<p>had a question I probably butchered your</p>
<p>name but anyway you had a question about</p>
<p>weight loss go ahead yes hi dr. Burke</p>
<p>thank you so much for all your tips I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been I&rsquo;ve watched all your videos now I</p>
<p>have a question for you I&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>your program for about I would say about</p>
<p>a month now with long intermittent</p>
<p>fasting now the only time I can get to</p>
<p>workout is 5:15 in the morning and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because I have a little one and</p>
<p>my husband has to go to work by 6:30 so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m usually home by 6:30</p>
<p>but then when I do my hips interval</p>
<p>training which is a program I have</p>
<p>joined it&rsquo;s called Orangetheory I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sure if you&rsquo;re familiar with it so yeah</p>
<p>I do very high intensity workout I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>eat anything up until 11:30 and 12:00</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s my last meal would be</p>
<p>probably six o&rsquo;clock in the evening so I</p>
<p>am doing anywhere between 14 to 18 hour</p>
<p>fasting now is that okay not eating</p>
<p>after a hits work Jonah and I usually do</p>
<p>it three to four times a week okay and I</p>
<p>do have been having a really hard time</p>
<p>losing weight to be honest even though</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on the ketogenic diet and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting well I do the days</p>
<p>I work out I do go to bed early between</p>
<p>8 &amp; 9 o&rsquo;clock at night so roughly</p>
<p>between I would say like 6 to 8 hours of</p>
<p>good sleep I would say okay but I&rsquo;m also</p>
<p>I have like bad PMS like not cramping</p>
<p>and all that but I have like really I</p>
<p>have I get into really really bad mood</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like a storm in my house with</p>
<p>my husband I just we argue on over</p>
<p>stupid things</p>
<p>so from what I did the quiz when I did</p>
<p>the quiz on your website it looks like I</p>
<p>have an adrenal gland body type but I</p>
<p>hold my weight all in my legs</p>
<p>not so much my stomach but it&rsquo;s my legs</p>
<p>great question I do hold on and I do</p>
<p>hold on to a lot of water weight I feel</p>
<p>bloated a lot of time yeah especially</p>
<p>around my cycle okay so before I yeah</p>
<p>like I get really bloated</p>
<p>god I know exactly what&rsquo;s going on so</p>
<p>let me just answer that out number one I</p>
<p>think that all you really need to do is</p>
<p>add some sea kelp iodine because that</p>
<p>with cruciferous will help your hormonal</p>
<p>female problems which is the menstrual</p>
<p>cycle I think that would actually really</p>
<p>help your PMS seek help</p>
<p>so take like two tablets in the morning</p>
<p>with maybe some cruciferous food</p>
<p>sometime during the day I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to help you sometimes you know</p>
<p>might need something called dim which</p>
<p>you can look that up I have it on the</p>
<p>website and videos too more strong it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually stronger but that&rsquo;s one thing</p>
<p>but the fact that you have fluid</p>
<p>retention and all that connected to your</p>
<p>cycle means that your estrogen dominant</p>
<p>so I think that is the hormone that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>inhibiting that your metabolism you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing everything great and I think I</p>
<p>would continue to do the height</p>
<p>intensity level training and and do it</p>
<p>just like you&rsquo;re saying you know like I</p>
<p>used to say in certain videos like you</p>
<p>could actually only do your workouts</p>
<p>right in the eating period but I changed</p>
<p>my mind in that because unless you have</p>
<p>a severe blood sugar it allow actually</p>
<p>help you it&rsquo;ll speed things up if you</p>
<p>exercise during the fasting period if</p>
<p>you can handle that it&rsquo;s actually a</p>
<p>really good thing in fact it&rsquo;ll speed</p>
<p>things up but for you you need to handle</p>
<p>this other health issue that&rsquo;s slowing</p>
<p>things down that&rsquo;s all and I think</p>
<p>things will speed up all right good</p>
<p>Karen you have any questions sure so</p>
<p>many here&rsquo;s one though I feel really</p>
<p>moody and agitated lately and I get</p>
<p>upset at the</p>
<p>smallest things how could I handle that</p>
<p>well this is this is brings up a really</p>
<p>good topic with hypoglycemia or low</p>
<p>blood sugars which is so common so</p>
<p>common I mean I would say the great</p>
<p>majority of the population out there has</p>
<p>a blood sugar issue and they don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>know it they&rsquo;re unaware of it so and</p>
<p>that when you have low blood sugars it</p>
<p>affects your brain and your emotions and</p>
<p>your mood more than anything else that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen so you have moodiness</p>
<p>irritable miss you get on the keto in a</p>
<p>minute fasting the problem is when you</p>
<p>get on it you know everyone&rsquo;s telling</p>
<p>you maybe to eat more frequently because</p>
<p>you have a blood sugar and you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to keep the triggers up so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>transition phase when you get on keto</p>
<p>and Emin fasting that could be one to</p>
<p>two weeks that you might have to do it</p>
<p>very very gradually so you can prevent</p>
<p>this moodiness and things but as soon as</p>
<p>you convert over and you don&rsquo;t cheat</p>
<p>between the meals your cognitive</p>
<p>function your overall emotional state</p>
<p>will be so much better I promise so and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s real the flexion of your blood</p>
<p>sugars and hypoglycemia so that is</p>
<p>really underneath the great majority of</p>
<p>problems out there that are misdiagnosed</p>
<p>and people put on medications alright</p>
<p>hey Anne you&rsquo;re from Boston you have a</p>
<p>question about a supplement I do in good</p>
<p>morning thank one so much for all your</p>
<p>help and education and information I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>watched all your videos particularly</p>
<p>about the pregnenolone field the adrenal</p>
<p>function and also how you can get stuck</p>
<p>in a stress mode and you have some sort</p>
<p>of massage technique for releasing that</p>
<p>but my concern is when I called in they</p>
<p>said that you used to have a supplement</p>
<p>for arm a blood test to show there was a</p>
<p>problem with the pregnenolone</p>
<p>I also have a high pair of thyroid</p>
<p>hormones low vitamin D and I was</p>
<p>diagnosed as being a pre-diabetic so I</p>
<p>was trying to find out what to order to</p>
<p>try to address all of these things and</p>
<p>also I watched your videos about the</p>
<p>fibroid</p>
<p>tumors and they said the pregnenolone</p>
<p>when you took a supplement that it might</p>
<p>make your menstrual cycle start again if</p>
<p>your post mental menopausal and even</p>
<p>though it had good benefits that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of the side effects that I do not</p>
<p>want right well my missile cycle to</p>
<p>start again so I was hoping you could</p>
<p>shine a light on what to do as far as</p>
<p>all of these hormonal problems and</p>
<p>actually the pregnenolone and the stress</p>
<p>factor with the adrenal problem so you</p>
<p>did you also say you at a low thyroid</p>
<p>parathyroid was a which it was high</p>
<p>excessive calcium it&rsquo;s complicated I</p>
<p>hope I&rsquo;m saying it the way the doctors</p>
<p>were saying is holy my parathyroid</p>
<p>hormone was high and they said it they</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s hard because my vitamin D is</p>
<p>low so a lot of things are out of</p>
<p>balance yeah okay so this is a really</p>
<p>great question when you have all these</p>
<p>factors that don&rsquo;t quite make sense it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>confusing you have high low high high</p>
<p>hormone over here and a low hormone over</p>
<p>here and someone comes to me what I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to do is get into the whole</p>
<p>thing where we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re correcting</p>
<p>symptoms and the reason is because we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not taking a stack stepping back and</p>
<p>looking at the whole picture because you</p>
<p>can imagine the complexities and oh yeah</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s give you a little bit more d3 but</p>
<p>that really didn&rsquo;t get rid of the whole</p>
<p>problem or the real underlying issue so</p>
<p>when you evaluate you want to look at</p>
<p>all the symptoms and try to make sense</p>
<p>out of it</p>
<p>the parathyroid gland if that is altered</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s probably a really good a good</p>
<p>idea to see if there&rsquo;s a little tumor on</p>
<p>the parathyroid gland just to make sure</p>
<p>because if there is you might want to</p>
<p>get that handle because you have four</p>
<p>parathyroids so you have it you have the</p>
<p>luxury of you know surviving on one or</p>
<p>two of them and doing fine because you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want any tumors growing but the</p>
<p>point is that what I would do in this</p>
<p>situation is go back to the basics I</p>
<p>would like to want to make</p>
<p>sure that you have the basics are you</p>
<p>doing kiddo are you doing in a minute</p>
<p>fasting are you having enough vegetables</p>
<p>are you doing enough nutrients in the</p>
<p>body and then reevaluate everything you</p>
<p>know a couple months because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna find that a lot of things will go</p>
<p>away just by getting in the basics</p>
<p>without treating any symptoms at all</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s many different causes of</p>
<p>a low vitamin D there&rsquo;s many different</p>
<p>causes of hyper thyroid issue and but</p>
<p>the fact that you have insulin</p>
<p>resistance or a pre-diabetic tells me</p>
<p>that the the ketogenic and the Newman</p>
<p>fasting will probably help you more than</p>
<p>anything and when you get that corrected</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be really curious to see how many</p>
<p>other things go back into balance the</p>
<p>fact that you have an adrenal issue</p>
<p>tells me that that probably would not be</p>
<p>a bad idea to support that because the</p>
<p>during the stress states that will raise</p>
<p>cortisol and even dump more sugar than</p>
<p>the system from that so out of anything</p>
<p>I think I would support the adrenal</p>
<p>first and then do the keto intermittent</p>
<p>fasting and then reevaluate and see how</p>
<p>many things get better okay good</p>
<p>question hey Glen you&rsquo;re from Florida</p>
<p>you had a question about diverticulitis</p>
<p>well actually I have uncommon for two</p>
<p>people okay and it&rsquo;s all about</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and keto first of</p>
<p>all you&rsquo;ve got to understand that you</p>
<p>are my hero you have saved my daughter&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like she is yeah it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s no small</p>
<p>thing</p>
<p>she is half Samoan and you know someone</p>
<p>women average about three hundred plus</p>
<p>then on top of all she is a semi driver</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s been averaging about 286</p>
<p>pounds now I&rsquo;m a nurse and a</p>
<p>nutritionist and I&rsquo;ve talked to her all</p>
<p>her life till I&rsquo;m blue in the face and</p>
<p>she just blows me off well she hit about</p>
<p>50 and she decided well okay I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>start doing something about this now the</p>
<p>thing that really amazed me and her</p>
<p>doctor she&rsquo;s always had perfect blood</p>
<p>pressure perfect heartbeat perfect</p>
<p>cholesterol perfect blood sugar and she</p>
<p>just you know and I just thought she&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>time bomb</p>
<p>the law was she got to taking care</p>
<p>taking like some super things like</p>
<p>spirulina nutritional yeast start doing</p>
<p>some really good things and then she hit</p>
<p>on your YouTube videos and she just</p>
<p>really got into you and I was so need</p>
<p>you know what she weighs now what she</p>
<p>weighs 234 pounds and still going that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something I am so relieved and you are</p>
<p>so responsible I can&rsquo;t tell you how much</p>
<p>I love I love you I just do okay now she</p>
<p>has a question she wants to know why you</p>
<p>never mentioned pistachios and are they</p>
<p>good for her okay good good let me</p>
<p>answer that pistachios I&rsquo;ll have to do a</p>
<p>video on pistachios I I think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>one of the better nuts and specifically</p>
<p>because the amount of essential fatty</p>
<p>acids in pistachios mostly the most</p>
<p>people consume they&rsquo;re roasted which is</p>
<p>fine there&rsquo;s still some nutrition in</p>
<p>there but it&rsquo;s a really good healthy fat</p>
<p>to have at the end of the meal not</p>
<p>between the meal because we don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to spike insulin because the problem</p>
<p>with nuts is this it&rsquo;s a great snack and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to just have a little bit and</p>
<p>so if the round the house and late at</p>
<p>night or between meals people just kind</p>
<p>of constantly put them in their mouth so</p>
<p>I think at the end of the meal it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>perfect thing to to help you feel</p>
<p>satisfied to go to the next meal so the</p>
<p>best nut I think personally with all the</p>
<p>phytonutrients would be the pecan first</p>
<p>pistachios are very high in that and</p>
<p>walnuts and then pistachio is probably</p>
<p>the third one but generally speaking and</p>
<p>peanuts are low low end but generally</p>
<p>speaking these nuts are very very</p>
<p>healthy and especially if you are</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re germinated correctly and you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have all the different enzyme</p>
<p>inhibitors but I&rsquo;ll have to do a video</p>
<p>on pistachios because there&rsquo;s some other</p>
<p>aspects to it that would take a little</p>
<p>bit longer but thank you so much for</p>
<p>your call and I know you have another</p>
<p>hot yeah for me I have been diagnosed</p>
<p>with I&rsquo;m in so much pain severe</p>
<p>diverticulitis</p>
<p>and my problem is that my doctor kind of</p>
<p>went off on me she didn&rsquo;t know that I</p>
<p>was doing intermittent fasting and I was</p>
<p>trying to get off sugars and and and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>working on this ketosis diet and and she</p>
<p>put me for this diverticulum Oh God she</p>
<p>put me on this bland diet that&rsquo;s got all</p>
<p>over pasta has carbs and all this crap</p>
<p>and and I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t you know I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>nursing but I I&rsquo;ve really never dealt</p>
<p>with diverticulitis delicious and</p>
<p>wherever this crap is excuse my language</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to do I&rsquo;m eating</p>
<p>pastas Rice&rsquo;s rice all this white crappy</p>
<p>mashie whatever I don&rsquo;t know how to</p>
<p>convert it to ketones</p>
<p>a ketosis a diet I I I am adding so much</p>
<p>trouble I don&rsquo;t know what to do okay so</p>
<p>let me just oh yeah let me answer that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like um you got it almost</p>
<p>be careful we get advice from and who</p>
<p>you follow even though someone&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>so-called expert in the field it&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of like the information that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>been taught honestly I think is</p>
<p>incorrect I would go back to a really</p>
<p>healthy keto and definitely in a minute</p>
<p>fasting because think about it your</p>
<p>intestinal tract when you&rsquo;re not eating</p>
<p>goes through a healing phase and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not constantly work so much so you we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to like overload it with work</p>
<p>to do when it&rsquo;s trying to heal so in a</p>
<p>minute fasting is the ultimate thing so</p>
<p>I just would not try to go get help from</p>
<p>the traditional people in healthcare for</p>
<p>that condition if it&rsquo;s not working get</p>
<p>alternative advice for maybe a whole</p>
<p>alternative practitioner or myself and</p>
<p>do in a minute fasting which is the most</p>
<p>important thing right now and then make</p>
<p>sure the foods maybe you&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>be able to digest kale and some of the</p>
<p>raw vegetables but fermented vegetables</p>
<p>like sauerkraut it should be you should</p>
<p>have at least a serving of sauerkraut</p>
<p>with a couple times a day that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to give you the vitamin C it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>give you the fermentation get probiotics</p>
<p>and I actually have some videos on that</p>
<p>one topic and I would study that but the</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing now with all the</p>
<p>grains is gonna mess you up long term</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the worst thing to do so get on the</p>
<p>the program that I told you stick with</p>
<p>that do more fermented vegetables and a</p>
<p>supplement that would be good to be</p>
<p>glutamate and I think you&rsquo;re gonna heal</p>
<p>over time so thanks for that question</p>
<p>hey Karen do we have any quick questions</p>
<p>over there the good questions the good</p>
<p>questions my team right here good</p>
<p>questions for my team there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>questions about estrogen what is dim and</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s something here I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>unfamiliar with maybe you know about</p>
<p>called maka MACC a and estrogen what are</p>
<p>your thoughts on that</p>
<p>yeah maka is like a superfood it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>green powder that people get and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>high end vital nutrients I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great I think it&rsquo;s great as they</p>
<p>phytonutrient rich thing very similar to</p>
<p>tumeric so that&rsquo;s my comment I think</p>
<p>that would be good to add to the meals</p>
<p>dim on the other hand is a concentrated</p>
<p>cruciferous it&rsquo;s like eating a lot of</p>
<p>cruciferous in a very small tablet and</p>
<p>dim is like 25 times concentrated</p>
<p>cruciferous so it has great properties</p>
<p>to balance estrogen now some people say</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s anti estrogen ik but really what</p>
<p>it does it doesn&rsquo;t lower your estrogen</p>
<p>it just loyals lowers the bad estrogen</p>
<p>and it raises the good estrogen so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really good for things like cystic acne</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good for hot flashes it&rsquo;s good for</p>
<p>excessive bad estrogen that leads to</p>
<p>issues for men that have too much</p>
<p>estrogen it&rsquo;s good for men and also</p>
<p>women as well and then I think there was</p>
<p>one more thing we said makamaka</p>
<p>dim and what else no just maca and dim</p>
<p>but I want to say to the caller and to a</p>
<p>few people who&rsquo;ve been sending some</p>
<p>questions in that I am going to be</p>
<p>looking at some more recipes for truck</p>
<p>drivers because I just learned about</p>
<p>these Road Pro appliances and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really big issue for these guys and gals</p>
<p>who are on the road all the time sitting</p>
<p>all the time</p>
<p>and they have to rely on you know these</p>
<p>these trucker stops and I&rsquo;m betting</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not kale and you know keto</p>
<p>friendly food there so we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>talk more about that and I could imagine</p>
<p>that the truck steps are very similar to</p>
<p>like a convenience store where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting just the lowest level nutrition</p>
<p>on the planet quick food yeah well I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s like a diner yeah and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to go to a diner and expect</p>
<p>keto although you know there are there</p>
<p>are some diners around here popping up</p>
<p>and serving that kind of thing but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not the common it&rsquo;s not in the main</p>
<p>right yeah there was something else I</p>
<p>was gonna throw in there but now you you</p>
<p>come up with that and I&rsquo;m gonna I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna take a question from Amanda she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>from Georgia go ahead you had a question</p>
<p>Amanda yes sir I just had a quick</p>
<p>question about your stance on t2 fuel or</p>
<p>keto OS or any of those things those</p>
<p>drinks that get you back into instant</p>
<p>ketosis yeah okay good question</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this big thing now it&rsquo;s a kind</p>
<p>of a sound that&rsquo;s all the rage on taking</p>
<p>ketone drinks or ketone supplements</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re actually just taking</p>
<p>external ketones here&rsquo;s my viewpoint</p>
<p>ketones are a byproduct of ketosis or a</p>
<p>fat-burning ketones are an alternative</p>
<p>fuel source so when people take ketones</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re missing whole point it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re taking something that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>art it kind of like an artificially</p>
<p>induced ketones now if you have not</p>
<p>changed your diet it&rsquo;s really not going</p>
<p>to do any good in fact if you look at</p>
<p>the claims for these ketones they really</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t say anything because they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no studies that show that it</p>
<p>actually helps you lose weight or it</p>
<p>does much for you at all maybe they</p>
<p>might be good for a long distance runner</p>
<p>that needs a fuel source but honestly it</p>
<p>really for me my</p>
<p>you pointed two defeats the whole</p>
<p>purpose of changing your eating to get</p>
<p>your own body into a state of ketosis</p>
<p>because this is gonna lead to I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to change as much I don&rsquo;t suppose</p>
<p>focus on the carbs or sugar I could just</p>
<p>add this and get into ketosis which</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re measuring in the urine well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just because the ketones are</p>
<p>going right through and coming out to</p>
<p>the urine that doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>ketosis it means that you&rsquo;re dumping</p>
<p>keep ketones in the presence of a little</p>
<p>bit of insulin or sugar your state of</p>
<p>ketosis will be shut down ketosis is</p>
<p>about dropping your carbs way down so</p>
<p>honestly I think I don&rsquo;t recommend it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s I have not seen the results</p>
<p>some people say well I work out and I</p>
<p>get a lot of energy but there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>people who are paying over 130 dollars</p>
<p>per month for this stuff and they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really see much change so I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the fad I think it&rsquo;ll come and go but</p>
<p>the point is I would rather you focus on</p>
<p>the root problem get the diet back in</p>
<p>and save your money I have another</p>
<p>question okay Karen this has come up a</p>
<p>couple of times</p>
<p>what about intermittent fasting in a</p>
<p>keto diet after gastric bypass surgery</p>
<p>okay gastric bypass you&rsquo;re basically</p>
<p>taking a part of the anatomy and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>reducing the size of the stomach lining</p>
<p>or the intestinal absorption truck if</p>
<p>you have this done it&rsquo;s imperative that</p>
<p>you definitely do a minute fasting in</p>
<p>ketosis because that&rsquo;s gonna eventually</p>
<p>fix the reason why you needed it in the</p>
<p>first place</p>
<p>people that have a way problem always</p>
<p>have an insulin resistance issue so</p>
<p>might as well correct the problem</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re if you do gastric</p>
<p>bypass and then you don&rsquo;t change or</p>
<p>correct the real problem you might gain</p>
<p>the way back so many women or men that</p>
<p>do this they end up having complications</p>
<p>and problems because they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>kind of like not getting to the root</p>
<p>issue the problem once you have it is</p>
<p>that you have a less surface of your</p>
<p>stomach so you can&rsquo;t absorb the</p>
<p>nutrients and proteins like you did</p>
<p>before</p>
<p>and I did a video on this so what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to do is probably enhance</p>
<p>your diet with trace minerals for</p>
<p>example liquid trace minerals 3-1</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re gonna have a hard time</p>
<p>absorbing him you&rsquo;re probably gonna have</p>
<p>to do between hundred corridor outside a</p>
<p>vinegar more to get your stomach more</p>
<p>acidic so you can start digesting more</p>
<p>protein and you might not be able to do</p>
<p>the quantities of the vegetables and the</p>
<p>food oh well still do in a minute</p>
<p>fasting as much as you can and the other</p>
<p>thing is that when you reduce the</p>
<p>stomach and intestine you also alter the</p>
<p>function of the liver and the</p>
<p>gallbladder to some degree so you may</p>
<p>have to help your gallbladder because if</p>
<p>you or if you don&rsquo;t have a gallbladder</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s even worse because you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to be able to produce the bile to</p>
<p>help you pull the fat soluble vitamins</p>
<p>so when you do gastric bypass that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really about maybe making sure that you</p>
<p>get all the nutrients and so you might</p>
<p>need to add more bile to this mix so you</p>
<p>can pull more things without Seibel</p>
<p>vitamins and trace minerals are a big</p>
<p>missing link okay so I have another</p>
<p>question from Michigan it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>the air go ahead pretty normal but after</p>
<p>that surgery he&rsquo;s having a linear</p>
<p>problem like that left you will open</p>
<p>around like 10 or sometimes like nine</p>
<p>point eight so doctor gave him some</p>
<p>supplements like then also some kind of</p>
<p>like injection in the bone marrow so</p>
<p>that I think the bone can produce more</p>
<p>ox even I guess and so this is like what</p>
<p>he can do to get out of it like</p>
<p>I mean what is the solution for this I</p>
<p>secondly he also detected with the gall</p>
<p>to gallbladder</p>
<p>yeah but those are not giving him any</p>
<p>pain okay</p>
<p>good let me just kind of I would with</p>
<p>your father he really needs to get the</p>
<p>basics there&rsquo;s a really cool keto course</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not mobile friendly right now go on</p>
<p>my site actually if you&rsquo;re on Facebook</p>
<p>right now you can type under messenger</p>
<p>kita course and get this really cool</p>
<p>course it&rsquo;s like four videos it&rsquo;s a mini</p>
<p>course free course and this is what your</p>
<p>your father needs to do to to get the</p>
<p>basics of how to get keto implemented</p>
<p>and in a minute fasting at the same time</p>
<p>watch those videos and apply that</p>
<p>information for those of you are on</p>
<p>youtube there&rsquo;s a link down below you</p>
<p>can click to go to messenger and</p>
<p>actually take the course as well again</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get people on the basics</p>
<p>here you have someone that had a stint</p>
<p>so we know there was a an artery problem</p>
<p>probably the coronary artery</p>
<p>most likely which is coming from high</p>
<p>levels of insulin that&rsquo;s grazing the</p>
<p>cholesterol creating all sorts of clots</p>
<p>and in fibrous tissue and damage to the</p>
<p>arteries and all this so if we recommend</p>
<p>anything like a supplement or anything</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to even touch it or</p>
<p>prevent it in the future unless he gets</p>
<p>these basics corrected you have to fix</p>
<p>insulin especially for the</p>
<p>cardiovascular system the cardiovascular</p>
<p>system responds so well to improving</p>
<p>insulin resistance I mean especially</p>
<p>with any type of like blood pressure and</p>
<p>cholesterol issues and just the healing</p>
<p>in general on top of that I would</p>
<p>recommend that he get vitamin k2 and</p>
<p>this is just something for the rigidness</p>
<p>and the arteries to improve that</p>
<p>something to help balance the calcium</p>
<p>buildup in the arteries</p>
<p>anyone with any type of weakness within</p>
<p>cardiovascular should really take</p>
<p>vitamin k2 you can go to my website and</p>
<p>type or you tube and just type on k2 I</p>
<p>have a lot of videos on k2 but if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not aware of it it&rsquo;s something you</p>
<p>should be aware</p>
<p>like get the basics in that&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>would do now that he had the stint</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s good but now we have to</p>
<p>get to the root cause so in a minute</p>
<p>fasting to be awesome actually so thanks</p>
<p>for that question for those of you that</p>
<p>are on Facebook I have a lot of cool new</p>
<p>information that I&rsquo;m releasing on</p>
<p>YouTube so go there and subscribe and</p>
<p>those people are on YouTube go to</p>
<p>Facebook I&rsquo;m actually releasing some of</p>
<p>some new information in there so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not all the same information on all the</p>
<p>different platforms and if you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>periscope go these other platforms and</p>
<p>subscribe or follow me because right now</p>
<p>a big question about what do I eat on my</p>
<p>site right now I have I&rsquo;m releasing like</p>
<p>a bit a new recipe every single day in</p>
<p>the right proportion of carbs proteins</p>
<p>and fats so this will give you a lot of</p>
<p>great ideas on what to eat with your</p>
<p>meals because sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>figure out like should I have more fat</p>
<p>should have more carbs or whatever or in</p>
<p>the form of vegetables or whatever so I</p>
<p>give you a lot of examples and we have a</p>
<p>really good chef that&rsquo;s helping helping</p>
<p>me with the recipes so sign up for that</p>
<p>and go to the different platforms and</p>
<p>then start being educated on these</p>
<p>basics it&rsquo;s time for Karen to ask me</p>
<p>another question well here&rsquo;s a good one</p>
<p>about iron absorption how can you</p>
<p>increase iron absorption and let me</p>
<p>throw to questions and so that seems to</p>
<p>be the gimmick today</p>
<p>Toofer yeah I have just oh shoot answer</p>
<p>that but then come back to me okay</p>
<p>iron absorption really has to do with</p>
<p>the pH of the body when the pH is</p>
<p>correct in a stomach you can absorb iron</p>
<p>the fastest way to correct an iron</p>
<p>problem would be to just drink apple</p>
<p>cider vinegar with each meal that drops</p>
<p>the pH and all of a sudden you can start</p>
<p>absorbing all these minerals and this</p>
<p>relates to a recent video I did with how</p>
<p>to never get a cavity again I mean think</p>
<p>about a child for a child to have a</p>
<p>calve</p>
<p>which comes from Latin word which means</p>
<p>decay like it&rsquo;s bizarre to me that you</p>
<p>would have someone that young having a</p>
<p>part of the body in a state of</p>
<p>degeneration or at decay enamel is</p>
<p>stronger than steel what really it has</p>
<p>to do with the pH the PFT pH becomes too</p>
<p>acidic in the mouth it should be neutral</p>
<p>which is 7 if it goes drops down to 6 or</p>
<p>5 or even 4 it&rsquo;s going to start to</p>
<p>demineralize calcium and phosphorous</p>
<p>from the teeth and break down enamel and</p>
<p>that usually comes from more bacteria in</p>
<p>the mouth from a lack of Listerine no</p>
<p>just kidding</p>
<p>it comes from excessive sugar because</p>
<p>the kids are even drinking liquid sugar</p>
<p>right now and so we got to get the sugar</p>
<p>out of the diet okay out of the diet</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get me started</p>
<p>replace replace the sugar with</p>
<p>alternative healthiest sugars like sugar</p>
<p>alcohols like xylitol but by the way I</p>
<p>had another question someone in the</p>
<p>confusion they thought that sugar</p>
<p>alcohol was an alcohol know when you</p>
<p>have sugar alcohols like a wreath rotol</p>
<p>salat all it is nothing to do with</p>
<p>alcohol you&rsquo;re not gonna be getting</p>
<p>alcohol from that at all it&rsquo;s a healthy</p>
<p>alternative especially if it&rsquo;s non-gmo</p>
<p>and and most of sugar the people are</p>
<p>consuming now come from beet sugar which</p>
<p>most beet is GMO so they&rsquo;re not even</p>
<p>getting sugar cane anymore all right</p>
<p>so Karen I think you had another</p>
<p>question yeah well we have a lot of</p>
<p>questions about skins so there&rsquo;s keto</p>
<p>rash rosacea sagging skin a lot of</p>
<p>questions about sagging skin so what can</p>
<p>we do to improve skin because women love</p>
<p>beautiful skin ok so there&rsquo;s two points</p>
<p>to this question and this is going to be</p>
<p>the last question of the evening but so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s when you go into ketosis and</p>
<p>especially in a minute fasting you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna eventually long-term go onto a</p>
<p>toffee giotto Fuji is like Auto Fei Jie</p>
<p>if you just want to type it and look it</p>
<p>up is the most amazing process condition</p>
<p>when your body is recycling old and</p>
<p>damaged cellular parts and replacing</p>
<p>with new</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like an anti-aging recycler it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>taking the junk out of the trunk it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>taking the garbage out of the house and</p>
<p>cleaning it and it cleans up old fungus</p>
<p>bacteria viruses so it&rsquo;s a really good</p>
<p>amazing thing and anyone fasting it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>powerful stimulator of that so your skin</p>
<p>is gonna look better the longer you do</p>
<p>this you&rsquo;re gonna look younger in the</p>
<p>short term though when you convert from</p>
<p>sugar to fat burning you&rsquo;re gonna go</p>
<p>through what&rsquo;s called keto deputation</p>
<p>sometimes in that case you might have a</p>
<p>rash met at a skin issue that&rsquo;s usually</p>
<p>a B vitamin deficiency that&rsquo;s why I</p>
<p>recommend nutritional yeast I have a</p>
<p>nutritional yeast tablet that&rsquo;s non</p>
<p>fortified that means that doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>any synthetic vitamins that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>easy to take because it&rsquo;s in a tablet</p>
<p>form that would be a good solution or</p>
<p>you can do the powder just make sure</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not fortified if you look at B</p>
<p>vitamin deficiencies one of the side</p>
<p>effects is always a skin problem b2 b3</p>
<p>b6 biotin b1 the side effects from those</p>
<p>deficiencies are always a skin problem</p>
<p>so by taking more you can have beautiful</p>
<p>skin so hey thank you so much for your</p>
<p>questions guys we&rsquo;re going to end up now</p>
<p>and the music is coming and thank you</p>
<p>somebody with Karen for answering the</p>
<p>million questions you&rsquo;re welcome thanks</p>
<p>guys for all your questions right see</p>
<p>you next week</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>[Applause]</p>
<p>you</p>
