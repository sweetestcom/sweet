    <p>The following is a conversation with Commander David Fravor, who was a Navy pilot for 18 years</p>
<p>and commander of the Strike Fighter Squadron 41, also known as the Black Aces, a squadron</p>
<p>of 12 airplanes consisting of several hundred people.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also famously one of the people who with his own eyes saw and chased a UFO, an</p>
<p>identified flying object in 2004 that is referred to as the Tic Tac and the incident more formally</p>
<p>referred to as the USS Nimitz UFO incident.</p>
<p>His story, corroborated by several other pilots from my perspective as a curious scientist</p>
<p>and an open minded human being, is the most credible sighting of a UFO in history, at</p>
<p>least that I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a humble, fascinating, and fun human being to talk to.</p>
<p>I put out a call for questions on Reddit and many other places and tried to ask as many</p>
<p>of the questions that people posted as I could.</p>
<p>And overall, I really enjoyed this conversation and I&rsquo;m sure if the world wants us to, and</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s more questions to be had, we&rsquo;ll talk on this podcast again.</p>
<p>Quick summary of the sponsors, Athletic Greens, ExpressVPN, and BetterHelp.</p>
<p>Please check out the sponsors in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that the world of UFOs and UAPs, unidentified aerial phenomena,</p>
<p>and aliens in general is foreign to me because of the high ratio of outlandish conspiracy</p>
<p>theorists to actual hard evidence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a scientist first and foremost, but an open minded one, often looking and thinking</p>
<p>outside the box.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m often disheartened by the closed mindedness of the scientific community.</p>
<p>And in equal part, I&rsquo;m disheartened by the lack of rigor and basic scientific inquiry</p>
<p>and study on the part of the conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>I believe there&rsquo;s a line somewhere between the two extremes that more inquisitive minds</p>
<p>should walk.</p>
<p>I think we humans know very little about our world, what&rsquo;s up there among the stars and</p>
<p>the nature of reality and the nature of our very own minds.</p>
<p>The path to understanding can only be walked humbly.</p>
<p>The very idea that there is a possibility that David witnessed a piece of technology,</p>
<p>whether human made or alien made, that moved in the way it did, should be inspiring to</p>
<p>every scientist and engineer on this earth.</p>
<p>There may be propulsion and energy systems yet to be discovered that, once understood</p>
<p>and mastered, will put distant galaxies within reach of us human beings.</p>
<p>Paradigm shifts in science and leaps in understanding can only happen, I think, if we open our eyes</p>
<p>and allow ourselves to dream, to think from first principles, and remove the constraints</p>
<p>and innovation placed on us by the scientific conventions and assumptions of prior generations.</p>

<p>This show is brought to you by Athletic Greens, the all in one daily drink to support health</p>
<p>and performance.</p>
<p>I drink it every day to make sure I&rsquo;m not missing any of the nutrition I need.</p>
<p>Now let me take a hard left turn and talk about fasting.</p>
<p>I fast often, sometimes intermittent fasting of 16 hours and then an 8 hour eating period</p>
<p>of 2 meals, sometimes 24 hours, that&rsquo;s one dinner to the next.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been even considering doing a 48 or 72 hour fast that some people I look up to</p>
<p>have done.</p>
<p>People who have done it tell me that outside of weight loss and the different health benefits,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a chance to meditate on the finiteness of life.</p>
<p>Not eating somehow is a reminder that we&rsquo;re immortal, that every day is precious.</p>
<p>I certainly experienced this with the 24 hour fast and I think it goes even deeper for the</p>
<p>48, 72, and even week long fasts.</p>
<p>Anyway, I always break my fast with Athletic Greens, it&rsquo;s delicious, refreshing, just makes</p>
<p>me feel good.</p>

<p>You probably know there&rsquo;s a show called The Office that I fell in love with, first with</p>
<p>the British version with Ricky Gervais and then the American version with Steve Carell.</p>
<p>ExpressVPN lets you pretend your location is somewhere else, choosing from nearly 100</p>
<p>different countries and then watch one of the nine totally different other versions</p>
<p>of The Office in other countries.</p>
<p>Also it protects you when you do shady things on the internet that you shouldn&rsquo;t be doing.</p>
<p>Like checking the website of this very podcast that for some reason was not available in</p>
<p>Russia for a long time, not sure if it still is, but if it isn&rsquo;t you can use ExpressVPN</p>
<p>to access it.</p>
<p>I think of ExpressVPN like a pirate ship, and regular VPN free life as a boring cruise</p>
<p>from one place to another with no excitement in between.</p>

<p>This show is sponsored by BetterHelp, spelled H E L P help.</p>
<p>Like you would try to spell if you were on a deserted island and trying to get an airplane</p>
<p>to notice you.</p>
<p>Check it out at betterhelp.com slash lex.</p>
<p>They figure out what you need and match you with a licensed professional therapist and</p>
<p>under 48 hours you can communicate by text anytime and schedule weekly audio and video</p>
<p>sessions.</p>
<p>Now, hard left turn, let me talk about desert islands.</p>
<p>Whatever you think of it, I love the movie Cast Away with Tom Hanks and the idea of spending</p>
<p>time on an island, alone, with potentially no hope.</p>
<p>The natural question is, if I could, what would I bring to this island?</p>
<p>The answer is complicated, but let me pick one thing, the first thing that popped into</p>
<p>my crazy mind which is the Introduction to Algorithms book, also called CLRS for the</p>
<p>first letters of the last name of its four authors.</p>
<p>I find algorithms beautiful, like a little toolbox for a simple world inside computers</p>
<p>when the real world outside is an impossible chaotic mess.</p>
<p>I would love pondering the puzzles in that book for months, far away from human civilization.</p>

<p>And now, finally, here&rsquo;s my conversation with David Fravor.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a graduate of the Navy Fighter Weapons School.</p>
<p>Yeah, I am.</p>
<p>Better known as Top Gun.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let me ask the most ridiculous question, how realistic is the movie Top Gun?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s funny, we used to joke, and a friend of mine who was a Top Gun instructor said</p>
<p>this, there&rsquo;s two things in the original Top Gun that are true, that are very realistic.</p>
<p>One, there is a place called Top Gun, and number two is they do fly airplanes there.</p>
<p>Other than that, I went through in 97, class 497, and there&rsquo;s actually a log of every single</p>
<p>person that&rsquo;s went through, kind of like a SEAL training.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a list.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a lot of posers out there, oh, I was a Navy SEAL.</p>
<p>No, you weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Well, I went to Top Gun.</p>
<p>You can actually go to Top Gun, and matter of fact, just to get a Top Gun patch, the</p>
<p>real patch, you have to have gone there.</p>
<p>So a lot of the patches you see running around are not real.</p>
<p>The real ones are controlled.</p>
<p>The people that make them honor that.</p>
<p>And when you go in, they look up your name.</p>
<p>If you want to get one, they look up your name.</p>
<p>You just tell them, they go, okay, here, and they&rsquo;ll sell them to you.</p>
<p>If you are not on the list, you ain&rsquo;t get no patch.</p>
<p>Because it is, it&rsquo;s a pretty big deal to go through, but for me, probably one of the best</p>
<p>experiences of flying, because everyone there is extremely competent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very challenging, but it&rsquo;s what we all signed up to do.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s just the entire group that is, when you want to be that, you know, that level,</p>
<p>you know, where you go, everyone really cares, and everyone really wants to be good.</p>
<p>Is it competitive?</p>
<p>Like, what was it, in the movie?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s, when you go through, it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s, if anything, it&rsquo;s more of the</p>
<p>students, you know, and then there&rsquo;s the instructor side, then the instructor sides are really,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re guys that, you know, they just chose to stay up in Fallon.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s extremely difficult job, because they have, they have a very small tolerance</p>
<p>for not being good.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re briefs, the guys when they give a lecture, so let&rsquo;s just say there&rsquo;s a fighter</p>
<p>employment lecture, which is one of the hardest ones.</p>
<p>It takes about two days to give the fighter employment lecture.</p>
<p>The guy who gives the lecture goes through multiple, what they call them murder boards,</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s scrutinized by his peers, and he practices, by the time they actually stand</p>
<p>in front of a class, they pretty much have their 250 PowerPoint slides memorized, and</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even turn around, they just click and they know them in order.</p>
<p>And they repeat the same thing over, it&rsquo;s, and it&rsquo;s standardized.</p>
<p>So they are extremely, extremely standardized when you go through the school, and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a reason for that, because what they&rsquo;re doing is they&rsquo;re training, so when you come out</p>
<p>of Top Gun, you&rsquo;re called a Strike Fighter Weapons and Tactics Instructor, okay?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re SFTI.</p>
<p>When you come out of that, your job is to go usually to one of the weapons schools on</p>
<p>the East or West Coast and train the fleet squadrons, and then you visit the squadrons</p>
<p>and train and do upgrade rides and all that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a reason that they are extremely particular when you go through the</p>
<p>course.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it is literally one of the best things, and it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not a rank based thing,</p>
<p>just think, oh, Navy, you can come in as a, you know, like an 04 Lieutenant Commander.</p>
<p>The lieutenants, the hierarchy, or at least to be, I don&rsquo;t know how it is exactly today,</p>
<p>but I imagine it&rsquo;s the same.</p>
<p>The hierarchy is actually based on seniority at the school, not necessarily rank.</p>
<p>So when the tactical decisions are made, which are based on fact and trying things out in</p>
<p>the Fallon Ranges, they set the top X number of folks that have been there seniority wise,</p>
<p>and I mean time wise, are the ones that actually make the decision.</p>
<p>And when the door, you may not agree, but when the door opens and everyone comes out</p>
<p>from the staff, they all speak the same language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s and it has to be that way, which is why the school has been so effective since it</p>
<p>was founded.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a, it&rsquo;s an incredible group of individuals.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bar of excellence that, that the instructors demand.</p>
<p>Oh, very much so, and they&rsquo;re held to it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a, hey, I&rsquo;m now an instructor, so I can do what I want.</p>
<p>There is a standard and they have to live up to that standard.</p>
<p>They have to, and I mean every moment of every day.</p>
<p>So if they go someplace, if they go from Fallon and they come down and do, they&rsquo;re called</p>
<p>site visits where they come down and they&rsquo;ll come to Lemoore, California, which is where</p>
<p>the West Coast Fighter Wing is at for the Navy.</p>
<p>And they go around and start flying sorties with the fleet squadrons to kind of pass on</p>
<p>some of that knowledge, that&rsquo;s that same high level of standard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s they can&rsquo;t just drop your guard because you wear the Top Gun patch.</p>
<p>And people know that.</p>
<p>And they wear light blue shirts.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pretty easy to identify them when they&rsquo;re out there.</p>
<p>And you know, and then everyone else who&rsquo;s been through the school, including them, have</p>
<p>the patch on their sleeve.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a standard that&rsquo;s expected when you come out of there.</p>
<p>So you were a Navy pilot for 18 years.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Can you briefly tell the story of your career as a pilot?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, you know, first I was in, I was enlisted, I was a Marine.</p>
<p>And then the Marines actually sent me, recommended me to go to the Naval Academy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s always better to be lucky than good.</p>
<p>But I got to go to the Naval Academy and I finished and I&rsquo;ve had that dream to fly.</p>
<p>So when I got selected,</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve always dreamed of flying.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Since 1969, when I watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon.</p>
<p>I was at that point, I asked my mom, I remember watching it, I was just prior to being five.</p>
<p>And I said, wow, yeah, it&rsquo;s so cool, mom.</p>
<p>And she said, well, you know, they were all pilots.</p>
<p>And then at that point it was like, I&rsquo;m going to be a pilot.</p>
<p>And if you knew me growing up, cause I was a little bit of a delinquent, people are just</p>
<p>like, yeah, right.</p>
<p>I used to joke, I&rsquo;m going to fly, I&rsquo;m going to fly jets, I&rsquo;m going to drop bombs.</p>
<p>And if people that knew me as a kid, they&rsquo;d be like, yeah, and they&rsquo;d be like, ah, not</p>
<p>a chance.</p>
<p>And then when I did, I actually had a, it&rsquo;s a funny story and I&rsquo;ll get to it, I&rsquo;ll finish</p>
<p>my career.</p>
<p>But I was at my cousin&rsquo;s wedding and we all grew up in the same neighborhood.</p>
<p>We kind of, they had Italian side of the family.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we grew up.</p>
<p>So it was my house right down the street.</p>
<p>It was my cousin, Chad.</p>
<p>And then right around the corner is my cousin Ray and my aunts and uncles and stuff.</p>
<p>The guy two doors down from my house, the paper boy in the neighborhood, so they all</p>
<p>knew me.</p>
<p>And I went to my cousin&rsquo;s wedding and Mr. Race looks at me and he says, David Fravor.</p>
<p>I go, Mr. Race, how you doing?</p>
<p>He goes, you fly jets, Top Gun and all that.</p>
<p>I go, yes, sir.</p>
<p>He goes, man, I figured you&rsquo;d be in jail by now.</p>
<p>And it was kind of a, to me, it was a little bit of a badge of honor going on and I kind</p>
<p>of overcame that.</p>
<p>But&hellip;</p>
<p>What do you attribute that to?</p>
<p>So you, I&rsquo;ve heard you before and just now say that it&rsquo;s better to be lucky than good</p>
<p>and you talk modestly about just being lucky, but if you were to describe your trajectory</p>
<p>maybe in a way of advice, like retrospectively, how&rsquo;d you pull it off to be like, to be truly</p>
<p>a special person?</p>
<p>The easiest way is one, never, never take no.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let anyone put you down and say you can&rsquo;t do it or those.</p>
<p>I mean, I knew, I knew what I was capable of inside, you know, and if I really believe</p>
<p>if you want something and you want to do something, then you can achieve it.</p>
<p>Not in all cases, like if I loved basketball and I really wanted to be in the NBA, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a realism that says I&rsquo;m five foot eight and I got like a really short vertical leap and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really not that good at basketball, it&rsquo;s probably not ever going to happen no matter</p>
<p>how hard I try and practice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the way it is.</p>
<p>Or for me to be in the NFL, I&rsquo;m not fast, you know, I&rsquo;m not that big, it&rsquo;s just physically</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m incapable of doing that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s things that don&rsquo;t really tie to a true physical ability as far as size and</p>
<p>strength, but it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s mental and I&rsquo;m not saying you have to be a genius and super smart</p>
<p>to be a fighter pilot.</p>
<p>Matter of fact, you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It really comes down to the ability to think very quickly, 80% solution is typically good</p>
<p>enough because if you overthink it, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re behind and then in an air to air fight,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what happens.</p>
<p>People try and overthink it and before you know it, because it&rsquo;s happening so fast, you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have, you can&rsquo;t get to the nth degree, you know, six decimal places, 80% solution</p>
<p>is good enough.</p>
<p>You have a really strong gut for the 80% solution, just yeah, I&rsquo;m a big believer in the 80% solution.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>If you get 80% you can go and then you can always adjust, which is exactly what, like</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re fighting in BFM, the 80% solution is it&rsquo;s like a chess game, but it&rsquo;s a really,</p>
<p>really fast chess game where you go, I&rsquo;m doing this and then I know that if I do a maneuver,</p>
<p>if he&rsquo;s going to counter it correctly, he should do a, if he doesn&rsquo;t do a, he does some</p>
<p>degree less like BCD and then I know how bad his, his error is and then I capitalize.</p>
<p>So my mind, I don&rsquo;t have to be perfect, you know, I don&rsquo;t have to go, I need to go to</p>
<p>47 degrees, nose high.</p>
<p>If I just kind of get above 40, then I&rsquo;m good and I can watch how it reacts and then I can</p>
<p>adjust for that.</p>
<p>And you, and you continually work that problem and you chip away because if you start neutral,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just basically chipping away and gaining advantage, advantage, advantage till eventually,</p>
<p>you know, and if you&rsquo;re really, you know, fighting, you know, just guns only rear quarter</p>
<p>where you got to get behind the guy, kind of world war II dog fight and type stuff.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s literally, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a very, very fast chess game that happens at,</p>
<p>you know, 400 knots, 300 knots depends.</p>
<p>So to get to be one of the rare individuals that are able to do that, he just had the</p>
<p>dream and didn&rsquo;t take no for an answer.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, you know, you know, part of it is family, you know, my dad was, I used to call him a</p>
<p>fire ready aim guy, you know, he&rsquo;d smack me and then asked me what I did wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Good parenting.</p>
<p>Um, back then, you know, I, I joke and people look, cause you know, at times it was kind</p>
<p>of tough, you know, cause he can be pretty demanding, but on the other side, you know,</p>
<p>I probably needed to be reined in a little bit at times.</p>
<p>Uh, but then everyone else in my family, you know, my mom was really awesome when I was</p>
<p>a kid.</p>
<p>Uh, my, uh, my grandfather who is a big, big part of it.</p>
<p>My mom&rsquo;s dad, uh, who he taught me a lot and you have a question there that we&rsquo;ll talk</p>
<p>about, uh, about him, but, uh, huge, huge influence.</p>
<p>Very, very positive.</p>
<p>And a lot of the stuff that I do today and decisions are based on things that he taught</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>Um, and, uh, you know, and I figured, you know, it was the first funeral I ever went</p>
<p>to and it was, uh, it was about three miles long and church was overfilling and people</p>
<p>were out.</p>
<p>It was a big guy, dead serious.</p>
<p>And you go, there&rsquo;s someone asked who died the Pope.</p>
<p>Um, uh, so, so a lot of people love them.</p>
<p>So back to, back to my career question, cause I&rsquo;m getting down at rabbit hole.</p>
<p>Uh, no, I, when I was at the, I was going to, I was going to stay in the Marines.</p>
<p>I really wanted to go, man.</p>
<p>I love the core.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, uh, of all services, it&rsquo;s that one, everything is in a ball and they&rsquo;re very,</p>
<p>very professional and it was a great, great organization to join.</p>
<p>Uh, but I went out to the Nimitz on my, uh, freshman cruise after your freshman year at</p>
<p>the Naval Academy, you go out on a ship and you, you&rsquo;re an enlisted person.</p>
<p>You get to experience that half when I already was enlisted.</p>
<p>So it was fine with me.</p>
<p>Because it comes up a lot.</p>
<p>You mind saying what the Nimitz is, what a ship is, what like, yeah.</p>
<p>So Nimitz is, uh, an aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, uh, four and a half acres of sovereign us territory that floats around the us oceans</p>
<p>giant thing.</p>
<p>Does it have weapons on it?</p>
<p>Uh, the air wing is really the weapons.</p>
<p>It does have defensive weapons, but for the most part it&rsquo;s a giant moving airport is what</p>
<p>it is.</p>
<p>So I was out there watching the airplanes land and take off.</p>
<p>Um, and I&rsquo;m like, Oh, and the squadrons that were out there, one of the squadrons was a</p>
<p>VF 41 and a 14 squadron, VF 84, uh, an F 14 squadron and then a couple of a six squadrons.</p>
<p>And we actually ended up part pairing up and hanging out with some of the a six pilots</p>
<p>and BNs.</p>
<p>So it was really a neat experience.</p>
<p>And I said, I want to do that.</p>
<p>And the way to do it was to not, to, to go in the Navy because there are Marine squadrons</p>
<p>that go out to the aircraft carriers, but most of them are land based, you know, to</p>
<p>support the Marines.</p>
<p>Cause there are that, that unit, that whole unit, you know, the Marine Corps is that one</p>
<p>surface has it all.</p>
<p>And, um, so when I graduated and I got to, uh, you know, I, I worked hard through primary</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where, you know, I knew Missy, uh, we were in, actually went through together,</p>
<p>Missy Cummings, uh, we went through primary together and then, uh, I went to Kingsville.</p>
<p>We all selected the same time.</p>
<p>I went to Kingsville.</p>
<p>There was another guy, Scott Weidemeyer, uh, the three of us.</p>
<p>So I went to Kingsville, Scott went to Beeville and Missy went to Meridian.</p>
<p>So the three of us that we had all went through, we got, we selected out of primary together.</p>
<p>We all ended up going jets and that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s how, besides from school, I knew her at school</p>
<p>too.</p>
<p>The long story.</p>
<p>I got done, uh, got winged.</p>
<p>It took me two years to the day from the time I graduated the Naval Academy until I got</p>
<p>my wings and, uh, through some luck, uh, I ended up getting A6s, uh, on the West coast,</p>
<p>which is a side by side, uh, bomber.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a pilot on the left seat and the Bombardier navigators on the right seat.</p>
<p>It was built in the sixties.</p>
<p>It is all weather, uh, and it flies low at night and it&rsquo;s got a terrain mapping radar.</p>
<p>How many, I guess, is that a good term to use fighter jets as a broad category for,</p>
<p>for the public?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>How many fighter jets are side by side like that?</p>
<p>That was, uh, in the Navy, that was the only one, uh, the Air Force, the F111 was a side</p>
<p>by side, but the Navy, it was the A6 and then there&rsquo;s the EA6B, which is a derivative of</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>And now that those are all gone, the EA6B is just went away a few years ago.</p>
<p>And now the, uh, E18G Growler, um, is the replacement for the A6B.</p>
<p>There was never a replacement for the A6, uh, that I flew.</p>
<p>It really became the F18, which, uh, the A6 could go quite a bit further distance wise</p>
<p>by fuel, uh, then the Hornet and, uh, the Hornet is the F18.</p>
<p>Is there usually two people in the plane, but they&rsquo;re usually like in front and behind?</p>
<p>In a, the modern two seaters, yes.</p>
<p>Uh, but most of the tactical airplanes in the world today are single seat.</p>
<p>Single seat, just one person?</p>
<p>One person, with the exception of, I&rsquo;ll probably, someone will yell at me, but really with the</p>
<p>exception of the F15E Strike Eagle and the F18F Super Hornet, which is the F is a two</p>
<p>seater and the G is also a two seater, but it&rsquo;s more of an electronic attack by say full</p>
<p>up fighter bomber.</p>
<p>So most of the time that you&rsquo;ve flown in your, like I said, 18 year career is, was it two</p>
<p>seater?</p>
<p>That was about half and half.</p>
<p>So I started off in A6 was a two seater.</p>
<p>Then I went to single seat F18s and I flew those, uh, all the way up until 2000 and let</p>
<p>me think 2001 to the end of 2001.</p>
<p>And then I shifted over and started flying the Super Hornets and I&rsquo;ve flown both of those,</p>
<p>the E&rsquo;s and the S, but I deployed when I had command of VFA 41, I had the two seat, they</p>
<p>were F squadron.</p>
<p>So you eventually ended up commanding the, the Strike Fighter Squadron 41.</p>
<p>I love the, the name, the Black Aces.</p>
<p>What, uh, is there some parts of that journey that are amazing, parts of it that are tough</p>
<p>that kind of stand out?</p>
<p>To me, it was one, it was a huge honor.</p>
<p>Uh, and I got to serve with, uh, you know, I got pulled up because the, the guy, the,</p>
<p>the people that are exos, cause we fleet up, you go from the number two guy to the number</p>
<p>one guy.</p>
<p>So the XO becomes the CEO.</p>
<p>So the executive officer becomes the commanding officer.</p>
<p>So I had worked with, uh, now soon to be vice Admiral Weitzel, uh, was the, he was commander</p>
<p>Weitzel at the time was the XO and he really wanted, because he knew there was a little</p>
<p>bit of a problem when the Super Hornets came into L&rsquo;more, L&rsquo;more had been a single seat,</p>
<p>a fighter community, uh, since the forever.</p>
<p>And now all of a sudden you&rsquo;ve got the F18F coming in, which has the weapon systems operators</p>
<p>in the back that are not pilots, they&rsquo;re weapon systems operators.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a difference.</p>
<p>Um, and Kenny is a weapon systems operator and, uh, Kenny knew because of my A6 background</p>
<p>that I have a switch that I can go one seat, two seat, one seat, two seat.</p>
<p>Because when you fly two seat, there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff that the pilot will offload and take</p>
<p>the advantage of the weapon systems operator.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not that one plus one equals two in that environment because it really, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a huge amount of capabilities that the single seat has and the autonomy that comes for the</p>
<p>ability to make decisions quickly and how well the airplane flies.</p>
<p>But it does, it does equal more than one.</p>
<p>I would say that one plus one with two people as well as a minimum of 1.5 because you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got an extra head, you&rsquo;ve got extra eyes, you&rsquo;ve got someone that can monitor systems.</p>
<p>The airplanes can do two things at once.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s an incredible amount of capability that we add when we do that.</p>
<p>Can we just pause on that just for me, from like a human factors perspective and also</p>
<p>an AI perspective, what&rsquo;s, how difficult, uh, so there&rsquo;s like when there&rsquo;s two people,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also a third person that&rsquo;s the AI part, the some level of automation like autopilot</p>
<p>maybe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>Maybe you can kind of talk about the psychology of like, you said making decisions really</p>
<p>quick, 80%, how do you deal with another brain working with you?</p>
<p>And then also the automation, is there an interesting interplay that you get to learn?</p>
<p>And also as that changed throughout your career, I imagine it got, it gotten better in terms</p>
<p>of the automation or perhaps not?</p>
<p>Well, I can tell you, so let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s start just, no, this is, this is good.</p>
<p>This is good.</p>
<p>And this is, I&rsquo;m enjoying this because now we actually get to talk about something other</p>
<p>than a Tic Tac.</p>
<p>So, um, so let&rsquo;s start with the A6.</p>
<p>The A6 was really an analog airplane, uh, that was built in the sixties.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been studies done on the crew coordination, which is the interaction between</p>
<p>the pilot and the bombardier navigator.</p>
<p>So we would fly low at night in the mountains.</p>
<p>So I was stationed up in Whidbey Island, Washington.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got the Cascades and incredible amount of time.</p>
<p>And we would get in the simulators because unlike normally people think terrain following</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s the radars, the 111, the B1 has a system like this, but it&rsquo;ll, the radar can</p>
<p>see and it&rsquo;ll fly.</p>
<p>It basically flies a straight line.</p>
<p>So it goes up and over mountains and back down and up and over mountains where the A6</p>
<p>was really manual.</p>
<p>So you do this low level routes where you&rsquo;re going to, you&rsquo;re going to fly in the mountains</p>
<p>at night.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be at, you know, 500 to a thousand feet above the ground, ripping through</p>
<p>like fog layers, cause you don&rsquo;t need to see outside.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re literally flying a little TV screen and radar.</p>
<p>What are you looking at most of the time?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re just at a screen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this really primitive.</p>
<p>If you look at it now, what we did, you&rsquo;d think, wow, that was crazy, but it was really</p>
<p>fun.</p>
<p>So is it similar to like the FLIR stuff?</p>
<p>Is that, is, no, this thing is totally radar based.</p>
<p>Now the airplane had a FLIR ball as a target recognition and multi sensor was called a</p>
<p>tram.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking at like basically like dots of hard objects.</p>
<p>No, actually what it is is the, the bomb of your navigator had a radar and he was getting</p>
<p>raw feed off of a pulse radar in front.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just basically mapping the mountain.</p>
<p>So if you look at a mountain on a radar and you&rsquo;re coming up on it, the front side is</p>
<p>going to be, it&rsquo;s going to give you a really bright return.</p>
<p>And then the backside, it&rsquo;s just going to be a giant shadow because you can&rsquo;t see on</p>
<p>the other side.</p>
<p>So the Bombardier navigators would do that and we, they would have charts and they could</p>
<p>shade their charts knowing that, Hey, if we turn a little bit left here, we can get in</p>
<p>this valley.</p>
<p>We can sneak up this valley and then go around the backside of the mountain, which is what</p>
<p>the airplane would do.</p>
<p>And so, and sorry to interrupt, I&rsquo;m going to just keep asking dumb questions, I apologize.</p>
<p>But the pilot, can you, can you at a high level say what the pilot does versus the Bombardier?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re actually just control.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m flying the jet.</p>
<p>The throttle&rsquo;s the stick and I have a, it&rsquo;s about a, probably a four inch or six inch</p>
<p>wide by maybe four inches, five inches high.</p>
<p>It looks like it&rsquo;s literally a CRT.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how old it is.</p>
<p>A CRT screen.</p>
<p>And what it would do, what the radar would do is the, the, the Bombardier navigator is</p>
<p>looking at his radar and he&rsquo;s looking out about 12 and a half miles in front of the</p>
<p>airplane.</p>
<p>So he has the range really scoped down cause the radar can see a lot further.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s looking at about 12 and a half miles when we&rsquo;re in the terrain mode where we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dodging mountains and stuff.</p>
<p>And what the pilot has is there&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re called range bins and there&rsquo;s eight of them.</p>
<p>So the very far range bin is the 12 and a half mile, you know, and the closest range</p>
<p>bin, it&rsquo;s a thing and it&rsquo;ll be like between like a half a mile and or a quarter mile to</p>
<p>three quarters of a mile.</p>
<p>And the next one might be three quarters of a mile to two miles.</p>
<p>And then it just keeps going out like that.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s a mountain in front, let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re on a flat plane and there&rsquo;s a mountain</p>
<p>out in the distance at 15 miles.</p>
<p>And we were just driving right at it.</p>
<p>So when we get to the point where it hits 12 and a half miles where the radar is going</p>
<p>to see it on his scope, my 12th, my range bin for that would pop up and it would show</p>
<p>like a big bump, like a mountain.</p>
<p>And then as I got closer to it, the next range bin would pop up and show it.</p>
<p>And I could see that that bump was moving towards me.</p>
<p>And then if I turned a little bit, you know, to go over here, I&rsquo;d see the mountain go over</p>
<p>to the right hand side and I could do that, but it wasn&rsquo;t like a video game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally like, if you think of the original Atari&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you build up, I imagine that you start to get a really deep sense of like the actual</p>
<p>3D environment based on that little Atari&rsquo;s solid display.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re exactly right.</p>
<p>And you have to, you have to train.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s been studies, as a matter of fact, a lot of the basis and people probably argue</p>
<p>with me, but it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>There were studies done watching A6 crews in our simulators, we call it the WIST, the</p>
<p>systems trainer, and it was not even a motion, it just kind of sat there and you just, you</p>
<p>could fly these things and they had terrain that they would inject into the system.</p>
<p>But the crew coordination, so you get, so my first fleet bombardier navigator, who I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>name him, his name&rsquo;s Chris Sato, he works at Apple, pretty high up, MIT grad, I think</p>
<p>computer engineering, he&rsquo;s scary smart.</p>
<p>So Chris could really work, as a matter of fact, all the guys I flew with, so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another guy, Matt, who also worked at Apple, who&rsquo;s now at SAP, we did our first night traps</p>
<p>together.</p>
<p>The bond between us, I mean, it&rsquo;s one of those things that you just, you&rsquo;re never going to</p>
<p>forget, but Chris and I, when we started flying together, we were actually the most junior</p>
<p>crew in the squadron.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d spent a lot of time training and Chris was amazing at how he could work the system,</p>
<p>one because he was extremely brilliant and he had that inquisitive mind of, oh, we can</p>
<p>do all these different things and there&rsquo;s all these degradation modes.</p>
<p>But we spent a lot of time to see how good we could actually get, because, and it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you almost talk in partials.</p>
<p>So as the BN is looking at his radar scope, Chris would say, I&rsquo;ve got rising terrain,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just what they say, showing rising terrain at 12 miles.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d see the little bump and I&rsquo;d say, got it.</p>
<p>This is going to go to your question on the autonomy and how you work with two heads.</p>
<p>So when you first get together, the interaction, it&rsquo;s almost like you have to rehearse it,</p>
<p>you have to know, and you talk in full sentences.</p>
<p>The more and more we fly together, Chris could go, I&rsquo;m showing and he&rsquo;d get like rising out</p>
<p>and before he finished, I&rsquo;d say, I&rsquo;ve got it.</p>
<p>So you end up starting to talk in partials because I have to trust him like, I mean,</p>
<p>there can be no, I can have no doubt that he knows how to do his job because I&rsquo;m literally</p>
<p>looking at this little scope that&rsquo;s not giving me this continuous picture of that mountain</p>
<p>moving.</p>
<p>Remember the mountain&rsquo;s here and then it&rsquo;s going to pop up here and then it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>pop up here because there&rsquo;s gaps in the coverage on how the system was set up.</p>
<p>Remember it&rsquo;s an analog system to where he is telling me, like, I can&rsquo;t see all the way</p>
<p>to the left and he&rsquo;s got a wider scope on the radar, but my screen doesn&rsquo;t show that.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s telling me, start a left turn, start a hard turn, you know, and we would do that.</p>
<p>So my truck.</p>
<p>And this is all happening quick?</p>
<p>Very quick.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re doing, we would typically fly between 420 and 480 knots of ground speed.</p>
<p>How many miles an hour?</p>
<p>Well, 420 is seven miles a minute.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Or eight, between seven and eight miles a minute is what you&rsquo;re flying.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fast.</p>
<p>At night.</p>
<p>I mean, I broke out of clouds.</p>
<p>I mean, I remember him and I flying, we were on, it&rsquo;s the IR, it&rsquo;s called an IR route, an</p>
<p>instrument route that&rsquo;s low, they&rsquo;re all around the country.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the IR 344 that we used to fly, which would coast in off of Oregon, you&rsquo;d fly from</p>
<p>the land, you go out over the ocean, turn around and then you could practice actually</p>
<p>coming in on a coastline and we were flying and we ended up in the clouds.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, we&rsquo;re between 500 and a thousand feet in the mountains and we&rsquo;re in the clouds.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t see anything.</p>
<p>And I had to turn off our red lights that flash, you know, they&rsquo;re called the anti collision</p>
<p>lights because it was reflecting off the clouds and it starts to bother you, just gets annoying.</p>
<p>So I turned it off and we were flying, we&rsquo;re flying, we&rsquo;re flying.</p>
<p>We break out of that coastal marine layer and poof, we break out and it&rsquo;s a decent night.</p>
<p>And this is right by Mount St. Helens.</p>
<p>This is kind of where we&rsquo;re coming in.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re coming in from the east and we&rsquo;re just north of Mount St. Helens is where the</p>
<p>route goes.</p>
<p>And you look up, you know, cause you can kind of see the silhouette of this mountain that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right next to you, but you&rsquo;re flying along.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just like, you know, you got to trust and you can see houses, you can see the lights,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re above you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re literally below people&rsquo;s houses flying down these valleys and stuff.</p>
<p>So just incredible experience.</p>
<p>So when you take that and then you move into an F18F.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re into modern technology that was actually built in this century and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>flying.</p>
<p>So now, you know, the WIZO is behind us and we&rsquo;re not doing those night low levels, but</p>
<p>that same type of crew coordination that has to happen because what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sharing the load.</p>
<p>So most of the communications that go out of the airplane, the WIZO does all the talk</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got actually, he uses his feet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the weapon systems operator in the back of an F18F.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s going to run, well, the radar kind of runs itself now, but we have a situational</p>
<p>awareness display and it&rsquo;s linked to all the other airplanes.</p>
<p>Just out of curiosity, what&rsquo;s the situational awareness display?</p>
<p>Because that term comes up a lot.</p>
<p>Think of it as a God&rsquo;s eye view.</p>
<p>So if you have the back of the Super Hornet has, well, the Block IIs has about an eight</p>
<p>by 10 display for the WIZOs that they can look at.</p>
<p>The pilot&rsquo;s is smaller.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s down between his, it&rsquo;s a six by six between his legs and they&rsquo;re getting ready to redesign</p>
<p>that Boeing is.</p>
<p>But when you looked, it&rsquo;d be like if you put your airplane and you&rsquo;re looking down.</p>
<p>So all the stuff, like if your radar seeing bad guys out in front of you, it&rsquo;d be like</p>
<p>looking down and going, oh, I&rsquo;m right here.</p>
<p>And now there&rsquo;s bad guys out here and my wingman is over here.</p>
<p>And it shows everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, it gives you, you can look at that display and go, oh, I can see where</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s at.</p>
<p>I can see if one guy&rsquo;s trying to target another guy, it shows you all this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible amount of knowledge that comes up for the crews to maintain the overall</p>
<p>picture of what&rsquo;s going on because it&rsquo;s happening so fast and this is where that autonomy piece,</p>
<p>this is the third brain.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re all looking at it and the third brain is doing fusion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pulling stuff together going, oh, this is all this guy.</p>
<p>This is this guy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sending it out through the link.</p>
<p>So all the airplanes are talking to each other through this digital network that we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even see.</p>
<p>It just says, that airplane says, hey, I&rsquo;m over here.</p>
<p>And it tells us and we go, oh, he&rsquo;s right there.</p>
<p>And then we can go, his airplane says, oh, I&rsquo;m looking at this airplane, this bad guy.</p>
<p>And it shows us, oh, he&rsquo;s over there and he&rsquo;s looking at this guy.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s an incredible amount of visual intake because your eye, you can hear a lot,</p>
<p>but when you look down at stuff, it&rsquo;s, you know, you can sell the picture really quick.</p>
<p>The third brain is doing the sensor fusion, the integration of the different sensors and</p>
<p>gives you a big picture view.</p>
<p>What about the control?</p>
<p>Like, is there, and I apologize as if this is a dumb question, but you know, people use</p>
<p>the high level term of autopilot.</p>
<p>How much is there, let&rsquo;s use a loose term of AI.</p>
<p>How much automation is there?</p>
<p>How much AI is there in helping you control there?</p>
<p>The AI piece would be more of a control loop because of the digital flight controls.</p>
<p>So the airplane actually, they had to make the airplane easier to fly.</p>
<p>And when I say easy, it&rsquo;s relative because people go, I could do it because I did it</p>
<p>on flight sim.</p>
<p>Real life is a lot different.</p>
<p>In flight sim, you have no apparent fear of death.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll do things on a simulator that you would never do in real life.</p>
<p>But the autonomy in the airplane to allow you to manage, I mean, because you think about</p>
<p>it, you&rsquo;ve got a radar that&rsquo;s feeding you data.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got a targeting pod that&rsquo;s feeding you data.</p>
<p>All that stuff is hooked to your head because you&rsquo;ve got a joint helmet mounted cueing system</p>
<p>on that basically maps the magnetic field in the cockpit so it can tell where your head&rsquo;s</p>
<p>at looking.</p>
<p>So if I turn my head to the right, the radar will actually look to the right.</p>
<p>The targeting flare will look to the right.</p>
<p>And oh, by the way, the backseater has a helmet on too, so he can look to the left and he</p>
<p>can do things.</p>
<p>So depending on what sensor he&rsquo;s controlling, so if he&rsquo;s got control of the targeting pod</p>
<p>and he looks left, the targeting pod looks left.</p>
<p>But if I have something where I want to lock a guy up that I don&rsquo;t see, that maybe the</p>
<p>radar didn&rsquo;t see, but I can get over and now point the radar, you know, get the, because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a phased array radar now, it doesn&rsquo;t really scan.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of cool stuff that that technology brings.</p>
<p>Because if you just, if you went back 30 years and said, hey, or 40 years ago and said, hey,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have this helmet and you&rsquo;re gonna be able to slew everything to your head.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean a mechanical setup, but I mean literally you&rsquo;re just gonna map magnetic</p>
<p>resonance and go, oh, look, and I can literally slew my sensors this fast and then mash a</p>
<p>button and transfer, you know, high quality coordinates from a system into a joint, you</p>
<p>know, a JDAM, which is a joint direct attack munition that is the GPS bombs that you see</p>
<p>all the time, and then let that thing fly.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m solving this problem in seconds, vice minutes, or, hey, I got it, we&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>to menstruate coordinates and, you know, you bring back the data and then they do all the</p>
<p>targeting for it and then they send another group out to get it instead of all that.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s that fast.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a, okay, I mean, we probably don&rsquo;t have enough time to talk about the beautiful</p>
<p>fusion of minds that happens when two people are flying, controlling the plane.</p>
<p>But at a high level, this is a really interesting question for people who don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about, like me, which is, what is the difference between a human being and an</p>
<p>AI system?</p>
<p>Like what can, what is the ceiling of a current AI technology for controlling the plane?</p>
<p>Like how much does the human contribute?</p>
<p>Is it possible to have automated flight, for example, like what is the hardest part about</p>
<p>flying that a human does expertly that an AI system cannot in warfare situations in</p>
<p>flying a fighter jet plane?</p>
<p>So I would say AI systems are usually black and white.</p>
<p>When you write the algorithm for an AI system, it&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s basically you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>thought and turning it into a giant math problem is really what you&rsquo;re doing, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got this logical math problem.</p>
<p>Math problems are, there&rsquo;s a line that says I can or I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very finite line, but you can go up to the line where a human, we all have</p>
<p>gray areas where we go, eh, maybe, eh, I&rsquo;ll try it.</p>
<p>So humans can operate within that gray.</p>
<p>So if you took, if you take an airplane and say, and I&rsquo;ll just take a Hornet for a while,</p>
<p>a Super Hornet, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, any airplane, and you go, here is the flight performance</p>
<p>model of the airplane.</p>
<p>So if you know what an EM diagram is, the energy, so it basically says the airplane</p>
<p>can fly as slow as this, it can go as fast as this, it can pull this many Gs, force of</p>
<p>gravity, so one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and then based on the airfoil design</p>
<p>and everything else and how it can pull, here&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s going to fly, because it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>physics based.</p>
<p>Well, if you, depending on how you write the AI, but typically AI, you don&rsquo;t want the airplane</p>
<p>to leave controlled flight, right?</p>
<p>You want to maintain it so that it is flying in a controlled envelope.</p>
<p>Where there are times, and you can go back to World War I, where people intentionally</p>
<p>departed the airplane from controlled flight in order to obtain an advantage, which is,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the human goes, can I do this?</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s outside of where I would normally go, but I can do that.</p>
<p>So you can do some crazy things now, especially since the flight control logic in modern airplanes</p>
<p>with digital flight controls, they&rsquo;re extremely forgiving.</p>
<p>So you can literally, I&rsquo;ve done things in Super Hornets that literally, even as a pilot</p>
<p>inside the airplane, you&rsquo;re just like, wow, I cannot believe it just did that.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;ll flop ends, which defies most logic, and I guess in a way you could probably program</p>
<p>it, but I still think when you get to the edges that may or may not give you an advantage,</p>
<p>there are things that a human will do that AI won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve got to the point, because how do you map illogical solutions?</p>
<p>Most AI is logical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s based on some type of premise when you write the algorithm to control it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s bounds.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s this giant mess, like you said, the difference between the simulator and real</p>
<p>life also gets at that somehow.</p>
<p>That there is somehow the fear of death, all of that beautiful mess comes into play.</p>
<p>Is there a comment you can make on commercial flight, like with Sully landing that plane</p>
<p>famously versus the simulator, all of those discussions, is there some?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s very similar to what I was talking about earlier with the A6.</p>
<p>So one is when you&rsquo;re flying with a crew, there&rsquo;s standardization.</p>
<p>So you got to remember when Sully flew, when his first officer, that&rsquo;s the co pilot, showed</p>
<p>up the first time they&rsquo;d met, and this happens all the time in the commercial world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s six, 7,000 pilots at United Airlines, your chance of flying with the same guy all</p>
<p>the time is slim and none.</p>
<p>Where in the Navy, we were crewed.</p>
<p>So I had a primary and a secondary whizzo that flew with me.</p>
<p>For months?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, for like all of the deployment.</p>
<p>Because you want to get to know, trust and all of those things.</p>
<p>It increases the capability of the airplane.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not to say we can&rsquo;t swap out, but for true effectiveness, especially in very complex</p>
<p>missions like a forward air controller, we&rsquo;re in the air actually controlling ground assets</p>
<p>and supporting ground troops.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a high threat area, which is crazy busy, you have to be melded when you</p>
<p>do that.</p>
<p>You have to have trained to do that job, otherwise you&rsquo;re going to be ineffective.</p>
<p>So when you get to the commercial world, and I&rsquo;ve got tons of friends that fly commercial,</p>
<p>there is a standardization.</p>
<p>Like we know that at this point, I&rsquo;m going to put this switch, you&rsquo;re going to do that.</p>
<p>And everyone, they know their roles.</p>
<p>Captain&rsquo;s going to do this, first officer&rsquo;s going to do this.</p>
<p>And they know that when the emergency breaks out, so in Sully&rsquo;s case, when they take the</p>
<p>birds and they know they&rsquo;ve got a problem, and if you&rsquo;ve listened to the cockpit recordings</p>
<p>of the two of them talking, you got to remember, they&rsquo;re talking to each other when you hear</p>
<p>the full tapes, but they&rsquo;re also talking to the air traffic controllers in the New York</p>
<p>area.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, we got a bird strike and the first officer already knows, hey, silence</p>
<p>the alarm.</p>
<p>They silence the alarm.</p>
<p>The first officer is pulling out the book, he&rsquo;s going through the procedures while Sully&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually flying the airplane, knowing that they&rsquo;ve lost their motors.</p>
<p>And you got to think his decision process, like they&rsquo;re trying to get him to go into</p>
<p>an airport in New Jersey, and he realizes, not happening, we&rsquo;re going to put this thing.</p>
<p>And he made a decision soon enough so that he could prepare everyone on the airplane</p>
<p>that he was going to put this thing in the Hudson River.</p>
<p>And he did it flawlessly.</p>
<p>I mean, every single person walked away from that wreck.</p>
<p>The only thing that didn&rsquo;t survive was the airplane, and it got fished out of the Hudson.</p>
<p>What is it about those human decisions you had to make?</p>
<p>Is that something you put into words or is that just deep down some instinct that you</p>
<p>develop as a pilot over time?</p>
<p>When you train, and aviation is a self cleaning oven.</p>
<p>So if you make bad decisions, and the list is long and distinguished of those who have</p>
<p>died by making bad decisions.</p>
<p>So when you look at what he did or the way we train, because the commercial industry</p>
<p>and the Navy and the Air Force, for all that, we have what&rsquo;s called, we have emergency procedures</p>
<p>that we have to know.</p>
<p>Like engines on fire, the first three steps, you just have to know what they are, right?</p>
<p>So they know.</p>
<p>The airline, same type, they go, hey, I know this is, they pull the book out because the</p>
<p>airplanes are designed, they&rsquo;re built to have some time.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a point where you have to make a decision and you can&rsquo;t second guess it.</p>
<p>So when he decided I&rsquo;m putting this in the Hudson River, he couldn&rsquo;t all of a sudden</p>
<p>halfway through it go, well, maybe I can get over to that airport.</p>
<p>He looked, he made a quick assessment.</p>
<p>This is that 80% solution where you go, these are not, it&rsquo;s like a multiple choice test</p>
<p>when you go, oh my God, I don&rsquo;t really know the answer, but I know A and D are wrong,</p>
<p>gone.</p>
<p>So the Jersey airport and going back to LaGuardia, gone.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s my next option?</p>
<p>Well, the Hudson River&rsquo;s there and that&rsquo;s probably looking pretty good.</p>
<p>Or what is my other one?</p>
<p>Can I get a restart on the motors?</p>
<p>And then if I can get a restart, now can I take it someplace else?</p>
<p>He had to make really, really fast decisions.</p>
<p>And then once they, as they go, that 80% solution, you realize, all right, I&rsquo;m going into the</p>
<p>Hudson, there&rsquo;s the 80%, get the book out.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if we can get an air start.</p>
<p>Because if you listen to the tapes, they&rsquo;re trying to get it air started.</p>
<p>The closer he gets to the water, the more he&rsquo;s going, I&rsquo;m ditching the airplane.</p>
<p>So the original decision to, this is my best option right now.</p>
<p>This is where I&rsquo;m going.</p>
<p>And you start eliminating anything that could possibly change the events, which they tried</p>
<p>to do.</p>
<p>And then he gets to that last minute, he says, we&rsquo;re going in the water.</p>
<p>They changed the plan.</p>
<p>They secure the airplane.</p>
<p>They do exactly what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And he does that basically flawless landing on the Hudson.</p>
<p>But you got to remember, it&rsquo;s every six months for commercial, they go back and they do research</p>
<p>in the airplane in the simulator.</p>
<p>Where they train to the airplane being broken.</p>
<p>You just lost a motor.</p>
<p>You just lost another motor.</p>
<p>So they go through this extensive training and all these, we used to refer to it in the</p>
<p>Navy as the pain cave where you&rsquo;re going to get in.</p>
<p>Because you know that when you get in for your check ride in a simulator, that the airplane</p>
<p>is going to break.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to lose hydro, and it&rsquo;s sometimes they&rsquo;re a problem like, oh, I just lost this</p>
<p>hydraulic system, but I&rsquo;m having an issue on the other motor.</p>
<p>Well, if I shut down this motor and I&rsquo;ve got a hydraulics, because there&rsquo;s two hydraulic</p>
<p>systems, one on each motor.</p>
<p>Well, if I&rsquo;ve got an issue with the left motor hydraulic system and my right motor is starting</p>
<p>to give me indications, do I want to shut the right motor down because that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to kill my hydraulic system that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m flying on a good motor with a bad hydraulic system and without hydraulics,</p>
<p>the airplane won&rsquo;t fly.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a really, they&rsquo;re challenging problems that you have to think through in real time.</p>
<p>And of course, the weather&rsquo;s never good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always dark.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always crappy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to break out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just all this stuff gets compiled on top of you and it&rsquo;s intended to increase the</p>
<p>level of stress because when things happen, like in Sully&rsquo;s case, we like to joke it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to STEM power, you know, where the functional part of your brain shuts down and you are</p>
<p>literally on instinct like an animal.</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;ve trained so much that that is the instinctive reaction that you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to have when the main part of your cognitive abilities start to shut down, you&rsquo;re running</p>
<p>that instinct is ingrained so much into you that you know exactly what to do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s literally how it happens.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no, how do I put it?</p>
<p>Fear of death.</p>
<p>Like in Sully&rsquo;s case, do you think he was at all ever thinking about the fact if his</p>
<p>decision is wrong, a lot of people are going to die?</p>
<p>You know, I can&rsquo;t speak for him, but I would say there was so much going on at the cockpit</p>
<p>in that time.</p>
<p>His, his mindset was probably, I can do this, I&rsquo;m trained, I&rsquo;m going to do the procedures,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve practiced this before, I&rsquo;ve done these things.</p>
<p>And I, you know, I&rsquo;m assuming that in his mindset, cause I never thought about when</p>
<p>things were really bad.</p>
<p>You know, if you&rsquo;re having problems with the airplane that, you know, that I was going</p>
<p>to mort, you know, and, and plant it into the ground, it was always, you know, maybe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an ego thing where you think I can do this.</p>
<p>I mean,</p>
<p>So you never, have you experienced fear during flight, like, I mean, one, one way we just</p>
<p>offline mentioned Mike Tyson, I mean, he talked about like, as he&rsquo;s walking up to the ring,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, he starts out basically in fear and, yeah, worried about how things are going</p>
<p>to go.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s purely to put in towards his fear, but as he gets closer and closer to the ring</p>
<p>is the confidence grows and grows until the ego basically takes over to where you think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way anybody could defeat me.</p>
<p>So like, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s his experience of overcoming fear.</p>
<p>But do you, did you experience any kind of thing like that?</p>
<p>Or is that, or do you just go to the part of the brain that goes to the training and</p>
<p>then you just go to the instinctual 80% solution?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say I was never afraid.</p>
<p>I think that would be, I can&rsquo;t, I couldn&rsquo;t tell you that anyone I know that wasn&rsquo;t afraid</p>
<p>at one time.</p>
<p>And for most of us, especially Navy carrier pilots, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s usually, especially</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re new and you got to go out and it&rsquo;s nighttime and there&rsquo;s no moon and the</p>
<p>weather sucks and the deck&rsquo;s moving, you know, the, the ship&rsquo;s going up and down because</p>
<p>it will scare the hell out of you.</p>
<p>Can I say that?</p>
<p>You can definitely say that, so it&rsquo;s about landing and take off that.</p>
<p>That is, if you, even they used to wire people up, they did it during Vietnam, you know,</p>
<p>guys would go fly missions, you know, when they were flying low and crazy stuff was going</p>
<p>on and people were getting shot down a lot.</p>
<p>The highest, the highest anxiety and heart rates were coming back to land on board an</p>
<p>aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>How hard is it to land on that?</p>
<p>It seems impossible.</p>
<p>Like for, for a civilian, I guess, like me, it just seems crazy that a human can do that.</p>
<p>The problem with night is, and there&rsquo;s different degrees of night, just like day.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s the clear full moon night, you know, where it&rsquo;s like, woo, you know,</p>
<p>this is not that bad, but you got to remember at night, I think everyone can associate with</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re driving in your car and it&rsquo;s just a, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s an overcast dark night and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on a country road with no side lights.</p>
<p>Most people have a tendency to slow down just by nature of, Oh my God.</p>
<p>Because you, what you&rsquo;ll do is you&rsquo;ll out drive your headlights because it is so dark,</p>
<p>you know, and you can get outside of, you get outside of the city and get up into New</p>
<p>Hampshire, especially when the roads are curving, you know, and the lines probably aren&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, now take that and multiply it by like a million because you have no depth</p>
<p>perception.</p>
<p>What you think is fixed, the runway is actually moving up and down and left to right.</p>
<p>Yeah, oh, and when it&rsquo;s really bad, you can actually see it move and we have two systems,</p>
<p>you know, there was a, there&rsquo;s an automatic system that&rsquo;s actually, it stabilizes with</p>
<p>the inertials on the ship and then there&rsquo;s the ILS.</p>
<p>Now civilian pilots will tell you that ILS is a precision approach, which gives you azimuth</p>
<p>and glide slope.</p>
<p>You know, you come down, it&rsquo;s like a plus.</p>
<p>On the carrier, it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s really just a beam that goes out and it&rsquo;s considered a</p>
<p>non precision approach.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not stabilized at all that, and I&rsquo;ve been where you can actually watch the needle</p>
<p>and the, and the tack and needle will move.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of stuff moving cause the base that it&rsquo;s all sitting on is doing this</p>
<p>and ships don&rsquo;t just go up and down.</p>
<p>They, they, they do this.</p>
<p>So the bow goes up and down in the tail, like you normally see a ship and then there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s pitch and then it has roll.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s doing this and then it has heave.</p>
<p>So the whole boat is going up and down while it&rsquo;s pitching and rolling and you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>land on that.</p>
<p>Um, so, and it&rsquo;s, I mean, I remember landing as I was with Chris, uh, Sato and, uh, Chris</p>
<p>and I, we were off the USS ranger, which is now decommissioned.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sitting, getting turned into razorblades, um, we&rsquo;re flying the old a six and we come</p>
<p>in and it was off of San Diego and it was just ugly night cause San Diego always has</p>
<p>a Marine layer that is about 1200 feet was lower than that, that night and it was pouring</p>
<p>down rain.</p>
<p>It was an El Nino year and there&rsquo;s thunderstorms all around.</p>
<p>It was just craziest night I&rsquo;ve ever seen out of San Diego.</p>
<p>And I remember landing and your adrenaline is so high that you&rsquo;re shaking.</p>
<p>I mean, you literally can&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>And we had spun around out of the landing area and we parked, we call it the six pack.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s right in front of the Island.</p>
<p>So if you see an aircraft carrier with the Island and the number of the ship on it, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sitting right in front of that and we&rsquo;re looking at the landing area.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like you get front row seats to the concert and, and this, this, this EA six B</p>
<p>comes in, you know, ugly pass.</p>
<p>He ends up catching a one wire, which is the first one.</p>
<p>You never want to catch the first one, which means you were not really high above the back</p>
<p>of the ship when you landed and it comes in and the exhaust on an EA six or an a six actually</p>
<p>points kind of down and it blows and it&rsquo;s blowing all the standing water on the aircraft.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how hard it&rsquo;s raining.</p>
<p>And you literally could not see across.</p>
<p>I mean, I could see the front of my airplane, his airplane, and then it was just white because</p>
<p>of the water being blown off the deck.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m shaking and I, I, I&rsquo;ll never forget.</p>
<p>I looked over at Chris and I said, Oh my God, I go, Hey dude, man, 10,000 foot runway looks</p>
<p>really good right now.</p>
<p>And I go, and I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m shaking my hands like this.</p>
<p>And I said, I&rsquo;m not even, this is, I&rsquo;m not faking this too.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s literally, I cannot stop shaking.</p>
<p>I said, that scared the Evelyn out of me, but you, but it scares you afterwards.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t, during it, you&rsquo;re not, I&rsquo;m not, you don&rsquo;t have time to think about that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>You got to do is we, you know, kind of the quote from Tom Hanks and what&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>The girls baseball movie where he goes, there&rsquo;s no crying in baseball.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s our joke.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no crying in Naval aviation.</p>
<p>I said, you can fly around and cry all you want at night, but you know, there&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>one pilot in those airplanes and you got to land it.</p>
<p>So you cry all you want, wipe the tears away, you know, put on your big kid pants and it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s time to, it&rsquo;s time to, you know, man up and, and land that, land the jet.</p>
<p>Sorry for the romantic question, but going back to the kid that dreamed to fly, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it like to fly an airplane?</p>
<p>What it looks incredible to me as a human, like a descendant of ape.</p>
<p>I sit here on land and look up at you guys.</p>
<p>It seems incredible that human being can do that.</p>
<p>You know what people ask, you know, I&rsquo;ll be sitting around with my friends and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like, how was it?</p>
<p>I said, it&rsquo;s the greatest job on the planet.</p>
<p>I said, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s an office with a view cause you&rsquo;re sitting in a glass.</p>
<p>You can do you know, it&rsquo;s like roller coasters.</p>
<p>You go, Oh, it does all these cool stuff.</p>
<p>So we take people flying every once in a while and it&rsquo;s like, Oh yeah, I like rollercoaster.</p>
<p>So I go, no, take any rollercoaster coolest rollercoaster you&rsquo;ve ever been on and multiply</p>
<p>it by a thousand.</p>
<p>And I said, it&rsquo;s an experience you know, to put your body under, you know, you know, the</p>
<p>jets rated at seven and a half, but it&rsquo;ll pull up to 8.1 before it overstresses depends</p>
<p>on fuel weight.</p>
<p>So, I mean, you routinely get up there towards eight G&rsquo;s to be able to do that to your body.</p>
<p>I mean, it takes a toll.</p>
<p>Like I can&rsquo;t really turn my head real good anymore and stuff like that, but would I trade</p>
<p>it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dream and how many people get to do that?</p>
<p>You know, professional, I want to be an NFL, you know, and you end up to the NFL, which</p>
<p>is a very small percentage with, well, I want to fly jets and to fly, you know, at the time</p>
<p>when I was flying the Super Hornets that we had in our squad and we&rsquo;re brand new at like</p>
<p>literally right out of the factory, I&rsquo;d come off our first Super Hornet cruise.</p>
<p>We had went to the Boeing factory in St. Louis where they were building my new jets that</p>
<p>I was going to get.</p>
<p>And I actually signed the inside of one of the wings while they were putting it together.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m meeting the people that are putting the jet together that&rsquo;s going to get delivered</p>
<p>to me in a couple of months that I&rsquo;m going to fly.</p>
<p>So just, I mean, I&rsquo;ll tell you what, when I left, when I decided to walk away, I told</p>
<p>myself I wouldn&rsquo;t, I promised myself that, you know, once you get through your O5 command,</p>
<p>your flying really starts to tag to come down.</p>
<p>You know, even if you, when you&rsquo;re an air wing commander, which is, we call them CAG,</p>
<p>carrier group commander, you&rsquo;re not flying as much as like the normal pilots, nor should</p>
<p>you be.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s young people that are coming up and it&rsquo;s training your relief because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the next generation.</p>
<p>So like currently I have friends of mine that we serve together.</p>
<p>Their kids are flying Super Hornets, right?</p>
<p>So to me, that&rsquo;s really neat because I watched them when they were little and now, you know,</p>
<p>one of them who was good friends, I won&rsquo;t get his last name, but Joey, who lived down</p>
<p>the street from us, was a Top Gun instructor and I&rsquo;m like, hey, Joey&rsquo;s a Top Gun.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s cool because, you know, I went there and I knew him, he would come</p>
<p>down to my house.</p>
<p>And now to see these kids that are, because typically military breeds military, you know,</p>
<p>because the kids grow up in it.</p>
<p>I mean, and I, the only reason that my son is not doing it is he&rsquo;s colorblind.</p>
<p>So it disqualifies you for being a pilot, being a SEAL because he had talked about doing</p>
<p>that because he&rsquo;s an incredible swimmer and he likes doing that stuff and water polo player.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s, you know, both of my kids are, well, my daughter is a doctor and my son&rsquo;s in his</p>
<p>third year.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a, I suppose, I mean, from my perspective, a bittersweet handover of this</p>
<p>incredible experience of flying to the younger generation.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t, you told yourself you&rsquo;re not going to miss it.</p>
<p>You miss it?</p>
<p>There are days I do.</p>
<p>When I hear jets, like if I&rsquo;m around a base or a jet flies over, but I have all the memory</p>
<p>so I can look at it and go, it can&rsquo;t go on forever.</p>
<p>You know, Tom Brady can&rsquo;t play football, but there&rsquo;s going to come a time where he has</p>
<p>to stop.</p>
<p>He seems to have done it for a long time.</p>
<p>But you know, typically when you look at it, you go, I had the opportunity.</p>
<p>And I think as automation moves on, especially with AI that, you know, when will, when will</p>
<p>the last man fighter be built?</p>
<p>You know, and that&rsquo;s that big question, you know, we just did F 35.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s over budget.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s seven years late.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of issues when we try and do it.</p>
<p>And then you look at some of the new stuff that&rsquo;s coming out that the air force is working</p>
<p>on with smaller, cheaper, uh, a trittable platforms that you can go, Oh, we can, because</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t put a man in the box or a person, because there&rsquo;s a lot of incredibly talented</p>
<p>women that do this too.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll just say that as person.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we say man and he, we mean both men and women because offline you&rsquo;ve told me about</p>
<p>a lot of incredible women that flown.</p>
<p>So I had, I had three, three female, actually four, one of them didn&rsquo;t fly anymore.</p>
<p>She actually lives right around here.</p>
<p>She, she&rsquo;s a, she ended up going into aircraft maintenance when she couldn&rsquo;t fly anymore.</p>
<p>One of the girls who everyone knows is incredibly, she&rsquo;s one of the most gifted people I&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>met in my life.</p>
<p>She is the vice president of Amazon air.</p>
<p>You can see her on TV, her name&rsquo;s Sarah, uh, incredible.</p>
<p>And then I had a page who ended up taking command.</p>
<p>She got out of fighters and went into other platforms.</p>
<p>Um, and she was a commanding officer.</p>
<p>And then the other one is a, um, teaches leadership and she is all three of them, actually all</p>
<p>four of the women that were direct.</p>
<p>Uh, I&rsquo;m hoping not forgetting, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m forgetting someone, uh, incredibly, incredibly</p>
<p>talented, uh, and a great addition to the ready room.</p>
<p>So anyone that gets into the, Oh, you know, women can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all total horse crap.</p>
<p>Hey, you know, we can talk about the original integration and stuff, which was not done</p>
<p>well by the military nor the Navy.</p>
<p>So women can fly as good as the guys.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t tell if you pass another airplane, you can&rsquo;t tell if there&rsquo;s a man or woman in</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>It comes down to, uh, stick and throttle the ability to, uh, uh, extrapolate where the</p>
<p>vehicle is going to be, where the airplane would be.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re fighting another one, you have to be able to think fast.</p>
<p>Anyone has those characteristics, uh, can do it.</p>
<p>And then I think most important besides that there has to be a desire.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying that everyone, if you took, cause we used to track.</p>
<p>So when I ran, we call it the rag, it&rsquo;s the replacement air group.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where, so the, the super Hornet training squadron, there&rsquo;s two of them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one on the East coast at one Oh six.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s one on the West coast, which is VFA one 22, one 22 is the first one.</p>
<p>So I ended up going there and I ended up being the operations officer and training officer.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So we tracked the last hundred students.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So everyone goes, ah, it&rsquo;s funny to hear students talk cause Oh, he&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>If you took the hundred, there&rsquo;s three at the top of the list that are just naturally</p>
<p>gifted aviators.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re well, well, well above average.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the person in a math class that sits down in complex math and they just get</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>You know, at the bottom, there&rsquo;s the three at the bottom that are going to struggle and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a good chance they won&rsquo;t get out.</p>
<p>And if they do get out, they&rsquo;re going to have to work really hard to just maintain kind</p>
<p>of average.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s just the way your mind works.</p>
<p>Not everyone is good at everything.</p>
<p>If you took the 94 of them in the middle, they&rsquo;re within one mean deviation of, you</p>
<p>know, it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all, you know, it&rsquo;s a, the bell curve doesn&rsquo;t look real good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a big hump and it comes back down and everyone&rsquo;s right there within one mean</p>
<p>deviation.</p>
<p>And then you have the outliers, usually not on the high side because they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>get through, but the outliers on the low side that don&rsquo;t make it through.</p>
<p>So for the most part, the Navy does a really good job, as does the Air Force, of screening.</p>
<p>So now what they do, when I went, you just showed up and you started.</p>
<p>Now what you do is you actually go fly Piper Warriors low wing to see, are you adaptable</p>
<p>to this?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an evaluation that goes through and then if you hit a certain mark, then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>good to go and then they put you into primary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like a, it&rsquo;s like a precheck, you know, like the preset, the pre SAT to</p>
<p>go, Hey, how am I going to do on the SAT?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s very similar to that, but it&rsquo;s more of a hand skill.</p>
<p>Can you adapt?</p>
<p>Because although we live in three dimensions, like this table is not, you know, we, this</p>
<p>is, you know, this is all has depth with all that, uh, where it&rsquo;s really relative to aviation.</p>
<p>We are two dimensional.</p>
<p>Very two dimensional.</p>
<p>Can you, can you explain that?</p>
<p>So our perception is actually more limited than the, than that of an aviator.</p>
<p>Very much.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we look at, uh, let&rsquo;s look at a tall building.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at one world trade center in New York cause that&rsquo;s the, everyone knows what</p>
<p>it looks like.</p>
<p>Big tall building.</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s what, maybe 1800 feet tall.</p>
<p>Even the Burj Al Dubai, which is like what 20 some hundred feet tall.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that big.</p>
<p>So a Super Hornet to do a, what a split S is, which is I&rsquo;m flying, I&rsquo;m just going to</p>
<p>roll the airplane upside down and then I&rsquo;m going to do basically a C the letter C I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to go in the top and out the bottom.</p>
<p>So and I&rsquo;m just against basically a vertical displacement of the airplane.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going from high to low.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very tight and it doesn&rsquo;t in about roughly about 2,500 feet, give or take a little.</p>
<p>So you go, that is, that is a really tight vertical turn.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>For example, the a six in order to do that was about 9,000 feet.</p>
<p>And we look at a building that&rsquo;s 2000 feet high and think that is tall.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So in, in aviation sense, when you&rsquo;re starting to do vertical displacement numbers going</p>
<p>from 35,000 feet down to 20,000 feet in a matter of seconds and maneuvering the airplane,</p>
<p>because the human brain thinks we really are.</p>
<p>We like to be flat.</p>
<p>I see what you mean.</p>
<p>We think 2d.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m fighting, how you really get an advantage when you&rsquo;re fighting another airplane</p>
<p>is to work in the vertical, because most people will do like one move in the vertical and</p>
<p>then they want to start to flatten out because that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re comfortable.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re profound.</p>
<p>Do you still think in like stacks of 2d layers or no, or do you, do you truly start to think</p>
<p>in that third dimension, like the rich 3d world of, uh, like of, of fighting that can,</p>
<p>do you start to actually be able to really experience the 3d nature?</p>
<p>You do because you have to project where you&rsquo;re going to be.</p>
<p>So you have to know the performance of the airplane knowing that, Hey, if I do this maneuver</p>
<p>that I am going to go, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s kind of like when I, when I talk about when we were</p>
<p>chasing the Tic Tac.</p>
<p>So the Tic Tacs coming up and I&rsquo;m at about, you know, and I&rsquo;ve been doing this for at</p>
<p>the time, 16 years.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m looking and I&rsquo;m going, Hey, I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s there on the other side of the circle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do a vertical displacement.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go like this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to cut across the circle and I&rsquo;m not going to him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going out in front of him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going over here because I know that by the time I get through this maneuver, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s going to be.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying to, you know, basically join up on him.</p>
<p>But I also had to look at it to go, do I have enough altitude to do this?</p>
<p>Because what I did before here and I do this, I&rsquo;m going to end up over here and he&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be above me.</p>
<p>And then, you know, I have to get that energy back to get up to him.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re doing a max performance, it&rsquo;s a trade.</p>
<p>So you have, this is, this is really important when you&rsquo;re, when you&rsquo;re fighting airplanes</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re really max performing.</p>
<p>So when you go to an air show and you see the air demo, he&rsquo;s literally playing with</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a finite amount of energy, right?</p>
<p>He can add some with the motors and stuff, but you&rsquo;re, what you&rsquo;re really doing is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a trade off and you can trade off kinetic energy, speed for altitude, which gives you</p>
<p>potential energy.</p>
<p>The other piece is, is I can trade some of that kinetic energy for performance.</p>
<p>Because I know if I do a nice, easy turn, the airplane will make it at what doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>bleed energy.</p>
<p>But I know if I do a real tight, that 2,500 foot split S, that it&rsquo;s going to cost me energy.</p>
<p>So if I enter the split S at 200 knots and I do it right, I&rsquo;m going to come out at the</p>
<p>bottom at probably 200 knots.</p>
<p>Although I lost 2,500 feet of potential energy, I converted that to that, to kinetic and that</p>
<p>kinetic was transitioned and bled off the wings in order for me to get that high performance</p>
<p>turn.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got to constantly evaluate where you&rsquo;re at and it&rsquo;s your overall energy package.</p>
<p>So you can have a guy that&rsquo;s behind you that looks like he&rsquo;s going to kill you.</p>
<p>But if this jet is at 400 knots and this jet is at 110 knots, this jet&rsquo;s just going to</p>
<p>pull away, drive around and kill him in about 30 seconds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s overall energy package and that&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;ve got to be constantly evaluating where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>And this is that 80% solution.</p>
<p>Can I afford to do this or not?</p>
<p>Yes, no.</p>
<p>And you have literally a split second to make the decision.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most incredible dance of human decision making.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just incredible.</p>
<p>I know a million people want me to talk about Tic Tac and I definitely will, but let me</p>
<p>ask the one last ridiculous, subjective question.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the greatest plane ever made in history?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get to like&hellip;</p>
<p>From Pure Speed, I would say SR71, I think it&rsquo;s an engineering marvel that was actually</p>
<p>developed in the fifties by Kelly Johnson, Skunk Works.</p>
<p>For what that was able to do, and then when you get into history of it, you know how they</p>
<p>actually built&hellip;</p>
<p>The CIA actually made like six companies in order to buy the titanium from Russia to bring</p>
<p>it back and build an airplane out of titanium that we would fly over Russia.</p>
<p>To me, that&rsquo;s an incredible&hellip;</p>
<p>Engineering marvel.</p>
<p>I think that like the X15, you know&hellip;</p>
<p>By the way, the SR71 still holds the speed record of any plane as far as I can understand.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s funny when you get into it is it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Remember, fast is relative.</p>
<p>When I say that, I mean, so if you&rsquo;re going 3000 miles an hour, a hundred feet above the</p>
<p>ground, you&rsquo;re going 3000 miles an hour through, you know, that&rsquo;s how fast you&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>When you get up to altitude, there&rsquo;s an indicated airspeed and there&rsquo;s, you know, your ground</p>
<p>speed.</p>
<p>So your indicated airspeed is really how fast the air is going past your airplane.</p>
<p>Well, the air is so thin up there, you may only be showing like 300 knots.</p>
<p>But at 300 knots, you&rsquo;re really doing 2,500 miles an hour over the ground.</p>
<p>So you know, like we would take the airplanes up to 50,000 feet when we had to do full the</p>
<p>maintenance check flights on them.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re doing 200, you know, in some odd knots, it&rsquo;s actually slow for the airplane.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, you&rsquo;re getting, you know, it&rsquo;s kind of like, it&rsquo;s not, you know, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>maneuvering speeds.</p>
<p>You know that if I hit a certain speed in a Super Hornet, that I have the full capability</p>
<p>of the airfoil.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m below that speed, I&rsquo;m going to stall the airfoil before I get to the maximum G.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>So when you look at something like that, you go, well, is it really going fast?</p>
<p>When you look at an SR71 that&rsquo;s flying upwards of, you know, 70 plus thousand feet, the air&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so thin, you know, just like the X15, you can get to a much higher speed, but the relative</p>
<p>speed of the air going over you is actually relatively low.</p>
<p>So the stresses on the airframe are not like they would be if you were down low.</p>
<p>But because you&rsquo;re going fast to get enough air over your pedostatic system to show that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going 300 knots, you&rsquo;re screaming.</p>
<p>I mean, the fastest I ever got was, I was with the, well, soon to be Vice Admiral White.</p>
<p>So we had taken a check flight and I got it up to 1.78.</p>
<p>I got a Super Hornet up to Mach 1.78 and it was, and we were just right by Pebble Beach</p>
<p>too.</p>
<p>And then&hellip;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that feel like?</p>
<p>Or is it just like&hellip;</p>
<p>When you get that fast, it started, to me, it got a little bit weird because you realize</p>
<p>in your brain, and I did, that there&rsquo;s no out.</p>
<p>If something happens, I can&rsquo;t eject.</p>
<p>The ejection would kill me.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that kind of liberating in a way?</p>
<p>Or no?</p>
<p>Okay, maybe not.</p>
<p>You always want to push the limit.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like how fast, I could have got it going faster.</p>
<p>It was literally still accelerating when I stopped, but I had, it was fuel limited and</p>
<p>space limited because I&rsquo;m off the coast of California, Big Sur, and I&rsquo;m going and I can</p>
<p>see Pebble Beach out in the distance, the whole Monterey Peninsula.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just going fast.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re doing almost 18 miles a minute.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re screaming.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>And then you have to turn&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, the airplane didn&rsquo;t have anything on it.</p>
<p>It was a slicked off Super Hornet, so it was basically just the airplane.</p>
<p>No pylons, no pods, no nothing.</p>
<p>And then we had to get it turned around because we got to go to the exit point for the area.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying to get it down below to subsonic.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a bunch of things that are disabled, like the speed brakes that normally we pop</p>
<p>out when you&rsquo;re going that fast, they don&rsquo;t, because the Super Hornet really doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>speed brakes, it deforms the flight controls.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t function.</p>
<p>So you really, you&rsquo;re trying to maneuver and when you&rsquo;re going that fast, you can&rsquo;t turn</p>
<p>because a 7G turn at 1.5 Mach is a pretty big turn.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible that a human can do this and a human can engineer the system which allows</p>
<p>another human to control that system.</p>
<p>To me, I think it&rsquo;s a great experience.</p>
<p>Was it sad to see the SR71 go?</p>
<p>I think it was during your career.</p>
<p>I mean, do you guys romanticize the different planes?</p>
<p>We would see it flying.</p>
<p>When I was flying Hornets, because West Coast flies and it&rsquo;s called R2508, which covers</p>
<p>the Navy China Lake area and Edwards.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge area.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, I think, we had a guy from Switzerland come out because they had Hornets</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like, this is bigger than our whole country, because it&rsquo;s a pretty big area in</p>
<p>California that you fly, but you would see the SR71s, they had a loop because NASA was</p>
<p>flying them out of Palmdale and they would take off and they&rsquo;d go up towards Washington</p>
<p>State and Montana and they&rsquo;d do a loop.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d see them coming back down, they&rsquo;d descend above 60,000, they&rsquo;d get contrails,</p>
<p>the white lines behind airplanes, they&rsquo;d come down and hit the tanker and then they&rsquo;d go</p>
<p>back up.</p>
<p>So it was cool to be able to see them in my lifetime flying.</p>
<p>But I think with money, age, the advent of satellites, because they&rsquo;re everywhere now,</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve got commercial companies putting satellites up, how much of that need was really</p>
<p>there?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve got to remember when those things started in the 50s, Sputnik wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>flying around.</p>
<p>It was the U2 and the SR71 that were out there doing that work.</p>
<p>So at the time it was needed, if you think about it really, it was an incredible feat</p>
<p>of aviation for that time.</p>
<p>I mean, literally we have yet to pass that and then you also ask, well, is there a need</p>
<p>to pass that?</p>
<p>I go, I don&rsquo;t know, we got stuff in space, so do we need to make an airplane that goes</p>
<p>that fast?</p>
<p>I think the next one is you get into the hypersonics where you don&rsquo;t have to put a person in,</p>
<p>it does all kinds of crazy stuff.</p>
<p>And all the work with automation, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you is you happen to be one of, at least in</p>
<p>my view, one of the most credible witnesses in history of somebody who&rsquo;s witnessed a UFO</p>
<p>literally an identified flying object.</p>
<p>And not only witnessed, but got to, how do you put it?</p>
<p>Like chase it, essentially?</p>
<p>Chase it.</p>
<p>So let me just lay out, I think it&rsquo;s easier than you telling the story.</p>
<p>Maybe me and my dumb simpleton ways trying to explain the stories, I understand it.</p>
<p>And then maybe you can correct me.</p>
<p>So on November 10th, 2004, the USS Princeton, which is one of the carriers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a cruiser.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cruiser.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t land on a.</p>
<p>No, helicopter, it has a helicopter pad on the back.</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>And it has weapons on it.</p>
<p>Okay, gotcha.</p>
<p>It shoots the missiles up.</p>
<p>But it has a nice radar.</p>
<p>It has an incredible spy one system phased array, four panels.</p>
<p>So it looks in quadrants.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>So they started noticing on November 10th that there is a few objects flying around</p>
<p>at 28,000 feet with speed of what I guess is considered a low speed of 120 miles an</p>
<p>hour.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know what that&rsquo;s in knots, but on the coast of California.</p>
<p>And they kept detecting these objects for just about a week.</p>
<p>Then comes in like your part of the story, which is on November 14th from the, I guess</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s from the USS Nimitz.</p>
<p>You flew and witnessed a 40 foot long white Tic Tac shaped object with no wings flying</p>
<p>in ways you&rsquo;ve never thought possible.</p>
<p>And in some interview somewhere, you said, I think it was not from this world.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a mysterious aspect to this object, to this entire situation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s videos involved.</p>
<p>The video of a flare forward looking infrared receiver has also the visible lights.</p>
<p>You can switch as a TV mode.</p>
<p>So that gives you visible light and then as an IR mode.</p>
<p>And Chad Underwood recorded that video.</p>
<p>And those are the videos that were released by the Pentagon later.</p>
<p>One of the three videos, the two other videos, go fast and gimbal were recorded in 2000 something</p>
<p>14 and 15 on the East coast of the United States that had different kinds of objects,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re weird in the same kind of way in terms of at least the videos and the experiences</p>
<p>that people have described were similar in the degree of weirdness.</p>
<p>But the differences is actually on the East coast of 2014 case, very few people have spoken</p>
<p>about it.</p>
<p>And even in your situation, very few people have spoken about it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a mystery to it, but it&rsquo;s in some sense, it&rsquo;s a quite simple story without much</p>
<p>resolution to the mystery.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of opinions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s division of opinions because it&rsquo;s a mysterious, I mean, it&rsquo;s truly is a UFO</p>
<p>in the sense that UAP, unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
<p>So can you maybe correct me on any of the things I&rsquo;ve gotten wrong, elaborate on some</p>
<p>key things and describe that experience in general.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what I know.</p>
<p>So yeah, we went out on our mission to go train and they canceled the mission and they</p>
<p>sent us down.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of rumors out here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of, after this has come out, so originally it was the four of us.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two jets, two people in each jet, they&rsquo;re F18Fs, okay?</p>
<p>There is no video from our event.</p>
<p>It was all four sets of eyeballs staring at this thing.</p>
<p>And then when we came back and told it when Chad and his pilot took off, that&rsquo;s when Chad</p>
<p>got the video of it.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re like, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>So when you say eyeballs, you mean literally your eyes are seeing a thing?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So as we&rsquo;re flying out, we get vectored.</p>
<p>They come up and tell us, hey, we&rsquo;re going to cancel training.</p>
<p>This is a USS Princeton.</p>
<p>So this is a Aegis Cruiser.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking to one controller who is like, hey, sir, first you ask what ordinance</p>
<p>we have on board.</p>
<p>And I laugh because we don&rsquo;t carry live ordinance in training typically because bad stuff happens.</p>
<p>Usually someone forgets to put a switch on and then the missile comes off and hits a</p>
<p>good airplane and it&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>So we had what&rsquo;s called a Catam 9, which is really just a blue two with the AIM 9 seeker</p>
<p>on the front of it, which is an IR missile.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s only two ways to get it off.</p>
<p>You can beat it off with a sledgehammer.</p>
<p>You can take this thing and you put a wrench in it and it unlocks the lugs and pulls the</p>
<p>lugs back in that hold it on.</p>
<p>When it really fires the impulse from the engine, actually throws the lugs forward and</p>
<p>breaks that release and it comes off down the rail.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>So they said, hey, well, we have real world tasking.</p>
<p>So as we&rsquo;re going out, my wingman, the other pilot, she maneuvers the airplane to the left</p>
<p>hand side of me.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s kind of stepped up like this and I&rsquo;ll use your mic box to start.</p>
<p>So as we&rsquo;re going out, they&rsquo;re calling ranges are called bra calls, bearing range and altitude.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re telling us, hey, it&rsquo;s at 40 miles or 50 miles and 40 miles and 30 miles.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re saying, hey, two, seven, zero, 30, 20,000, that&rsquo;s all they say.</p>
<p>So we got our radars and we had to mechanically scan radars at the time, APG 73.</p>
<p>Good piece of gear, APG 79, new one&rsquo;s way better.</p>
<p>But anyway.</p>
<p>And I apologize if I interrupt the story, hopefully it&rsquo;s useful, but they&rsquo;re telling</p>
<p>you a location of a thing that you should look at.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re telling us they have a contact on their radar.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know what it is.</p>
<p>They just have a blip.</p>
<p>They have a little blip.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;ve been watching these things and what he told me is they had been looking at</p>
<p>these things as we&rsquo;re driving.</p>
<p>He says, sir, we&rsquo;ve been tracking these things for about two weeks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s we had been at sea for two weeks.</p>
<p>This is the first time we&rsquo;ve had planes airborne.</p>
<p>We want you to go see what these are.</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>So they kind of interrupt the mission to say, check it out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly it.</p>
<p>So we start driving out there and as we get down to, he&rsquo;s going, you know, 20 miles, 15</p>
<p>miles, 10 miles.</p>
<p>And then you get to a point where they call merge plot, which means we are inside of the</p>
<p>resolution cell of the radar because radars don&rsquo;t see everything there.</p>
<p>So they have a range and they have an azimuth resolution, right?</p>
<p>So and it&rsquo;s basically think of a little cube so they can, and the whole sky is made of</p>
<p>all these little cubes and they&rsquo;re looking.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re inside a cube with something and you&rsquo;re both inside the same little cube,</p>
<p>then the radar can only see one thing.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>So they call merge plot.</p>
<p>Well, when we say merge plot to us, it means he&rsquo;s right around, something&rsquo;s around you,</p>
<p>get your head out.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not looking at radar scopes anymore and the wizos, the wizos can look, but everyone</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s heads out.</p>
<p>When they say merge plot, you&rsquo;re done looking at your displays inside.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing this and you&rsquo;re trying to find it.</p>
<p>So as we look out to the right and you look high and low, because he could be anywhere</p>
<p>from the surface all the way up.</p>
<p>Now keep in mind the ship is like probably 60 miles away, so it can&rsquo;t see the surface</p>
<p>and you can do your standard radar horizon calculation and go, hey, it&rsquo;s the thing is</p>
<p>40 feet off the water, the panel, can he really see, you know, there are radars that can see</p>
<p>around the curve, but let&rsquo;s just say that it can&rsquo;t at this time.</p>
<p>So you go, is it, you know, where is it at?</p>
<p>So as we&rsquo;re looking around, we see, now this is a, it&rsquo;s a clear day.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no clouds and there&rsquo;s no whitecaps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a calm, it&rsquo;s actually a perfect day.</p>
<p>If you own a sailboat, it was that five to 10 knots of wind and you just want to kind</p>
<p>of go out there and you&rsquo;re not going to get beat up and have whitewater coming out.</p>
<p>It was the perfect day to own a sailboat.</p>
<p>How many miles out do you see?</p>
<p>Like seven, like you see just, it&rsquo;s a clear day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 50, it&rsquo;s unrestricted visibility.</p>
<p>You can see literally all the way to the horizon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just clear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re basically off the coast.</p>
<p>If you look at a map and you go San Diego and then inside of Mexico, we&rsquo;re kind of in</p>
<p>between that.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re probably about, by the time this all hits, we&rsquo;re price, I don&rsquo;t know, 80, 100,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but somewhere out, it&rsquo;s pretty far off the coast, but from 20,000 feet, you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>be amazed.</p>
<p>You can do the calculation.</p>
<p>You can see stuff, you know, you&rsquo;ll see land 50 miles away, you know, you can see, you</p>
<p>know, and when you&rsquo;re looking at a continent, it&rsquo;s really easy to see you&rsquo;re not looking</p>
<p>at an island.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re looking at Mexico.</p>
<p>And you can see on the whitecaps in the water, if there is any.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, they&rsquo;re easy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>For us, we look at it because we know if it&rsquo;s natural wind or, so if it&rsquo;s a really whitecap</p>
<p>windy day, then the ships just kind of barely be moving when we land on it.</p>
<p>It makes it actually easier.</p>
<p>If the ship has to move or it&rsquo;s got a big weight because it has to make its own wind</p>
<p>when we land, which is the day that it was this day, you go, oh, okay.</p>
<p>And it creates what&rsquo;s called, we call the burble, but when the air flows across the</p>
<p>flight deck, it drops behind the ship, you know, and then it kicks back up.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re coming board to land, it&rsquo;s going to make you go up a little bit and then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to fall and you got to anticipate that to stay on glideslope.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re pretty conscious of what&rsquo;s going on out there with the waves and the wind.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no waves, there&rsquo;s no wind, there&rsquo;s no whitecaps, and we look down and we see</p>
<p>whitewater.</p>
<p>So if you put a piece of land, a seamount below the surface, like, you know, even 20</p>
<p>feet below the surface, it&rsquo;s big enough.</p>
<p>As the waves come in, you know, waves have height and length.</p>
<p>When they come in, that&rsquo;s what happens on the shore, when a wave comes in, it hits and</p>
<p>then it starts to collapse and it pushes the wave height up because it can&rsquo;t go anymore</p>
<p>and then it breaks over the top and that&rsquo;s where you get the weight.</p>
<p>So what happens is at sea, when you get a seamount, you&rsquo;ll see stuff come in, the wave</p>
<p>will crash and you&rsquo;ll get whitewater.</p>
<p>You can go out when it&rsquo;s high tide in any one of the coasts, you can go out here off</p>
<p>of Boston and go, hey, at low tide, I can see those rocks and at high tide, I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see the rocks are covered, but there&rsquo;ll be whitewater around those rocks.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to tell there&rsquo;s something underneath the surface.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what it was.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see an object because there&rsquo;s all kinds of, oh, they saw another craft below</p>
<p>the wave.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t see anything below the water.</p>
<p>We just saw whitewater.</p>
<p>But the whitewater, and I like to shape it, you can say it was a cross.</p>
<p>I say it&rsquo;s about the size of a 737.</p>
<p>So it looks like if you took a 737, put it about 15, 20 feet below the water so the wave</p>
<p>is breaking over the top and you&rsquo;re going to get whitewater where the plane is at, you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>see this kind of shape.</p>
<p>So it looks like a cross.</p>
<p>So as we&rsquo;re looking down off the right side, the backseater in the other airplane, Jim,</p>
<p>says this is that talking in partials again.</p>
<p>He says, hey, Skipper, do you?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s about what he gets out of his mouth.</p>
<p>And I go, what the hell is that?</p>
<p>In a nice way.</p>
<p>Do you see that essentially is what he&rsquo;s saying?</p>
<p>So we see the whitewater and that&rsquo;s what draws our eyes down there.</p>
<p>Otherwise we&rsquo;d have never seen it.</p>
<p>So we see this whitewater.</p>
<p>I would have loved to see the look on your face when you see that.</p>
<p>And then we see this little white tic tac because we&rsquo;re about 20,000 feet above it and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s doing, it&rsquo;s going basically north, south, and then east, west, north, and it&rsquo;s abrupt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very abrupt.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like a helicopter, if a helicopter is going sideways and it goes once, it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>sideways left and it goes right, what it&rsquo;ll do is it&rsquo;ll go, it&rsquo;s got a speed, it slows</p>
<p>down because there&rsquo;s inertia and it stops and then it goes back the other way.</p>
<p>This thing&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s like left, right, left, right with no.</p>
<p>So moving in ways that doesn&rsquo;t feel intuitive to you of the things you&rsquo;ve seen in the past.</p>
<p>So as a pilot, the first thing you think is it&rsquo;s a helicopter, right?</p>
<p>So you go, oh, what is, cause when we see it&rsquo;s moving, we&rsquo;re like, oh, helicopter.</p>
<p>So the first thing you look for to see if it&rsquo;s a helicopter when they&rsquo;re doing that,</p>
<p>because usually when they get down there towards that 50 feet, you&rsquo;ll get rotor wash.</p>
<p>You see it in the movies when the helicopter&rsquo;s by the water, it kicks, the water comes up</p>
<p>the sides cause the downdraft, you know, like a thunderstorm will do that.</p>
<p>It pushes the air down and then it has to come up the sides.</p>
<p>So you see it and you go, well, there&rsquo;s no, there&rsquo;s no rotor wash.</p>
<p>What is that thing?</p>
<p>So by this time we&rsquo;re driving around.</p>
<p>So as we&rsquo;re, if we were at the six oclock, we&rsquo;re driving around towards that nine oclock</p>
<p>position and we&rsquo;re just watching this thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s still pointing north, south, and it&rsquo;s going left, right, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of moving around the object.</p>
<p>And if it had, if I had to say it biased itself, it was biased towards the bottom half.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve got the east, west, and then the north, south kind of across, it&rsquo;s hanging</p>
<p>out on the southern thing that&rsquo;s hanging out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just kind of moving around up, down, left, and it&rsquo;s crossing over it and it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just kind of, so now we&rsquo;re like, what the hell is that?</p>
<p>So then I go, hey, I&rsquo;m going to go check it out.</p>
<p>And the other pilot says, I&rsquo;m going to stay up here.</p>
<p>And I said, yeah, stay up high.</p>
<p>Because now we get, we get a different perspective.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s up here and I&rsquo;m down here as I&rsquo;m descending.</p>
<p>She can watch, because right now all I&rsquo;m watching is the Tic Tac.</p>
<p>She can watch me and the Tic Tac.</p>
<p>So she gets a God&rsquo;s eye view of everything that&rsquo;s going on, which is really important.</p>
<p>You know, you can hear people say it&rsquo;s high cover, whatever.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s watching me, which is, it&rsquo;s perfect as the story goes on, because it gives us</p>
<p>two perspectives, you know, of a perspective that&rsquo;s about 8,000 feet above us when that</p>
<p>thing disappears.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t, you know, because if it&rsquo;s just like, oh, I lost it and they go, no,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s over to the right.</p>
<p>We can still see it.</p>
<p>We all lost it at the same time.</p>
<p>So as we come down, we get to about 12 oclock and I&rsquo;m descending and it&rsquo;s an easy descent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing about 300 knots, which is a really good airspeed for the airplane for maneuvering</p>
<p>because I have, I have everything available to me at that speed.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m coming down and as I get to 12 oclock, as the Tic Tac&rsquo;s doing this, it literally,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s aware of us and it just goes bloop and it kind of points out towards the</p>
<p>West and starts coming up.</p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s obviously knows that we&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>Whatever this thing is, it knows that we&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>So as we drive around, it&rsquo;s coming up and I&rsquo;m just coming down.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just, I&rsquo;m just watching it.</p>
<p>Now, you gotta remember this whole thing is like, this is like five minutes.</p>
<p>This is not like we saw it and it was gone or, oh, I saw lights in the sky and they were</p>
<p>gone.</p>
<p>We watched this thing on a crystal clear day with four trained observers, watch this thing</p>
<p>fly around.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re like, okay.</p>
<p>So I get over to the eight oclock position and I&rsquo;m a little, I&rsquo;m a couple thousand feet</p>
<p>above it and it&rsquo;s about, so I&rsquo;m probably at about 15 K I think it is.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s my story is about 15.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just estimating.</p>
<p>So you can see it&rsquo;s just a really easy descent because.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s 15 K?</p>
<p>15,000 feet.</p>
<p>I thought it was 8,000.</p>
<p>No, the other plane ends up about that.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re still at about 20,000 feet.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re driving around and I&rsquo;m descending.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re staying up there.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m kind of doing this as they drive around.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m looking at this thing and it&rsquo;s about the two oclock position.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re about the eight oclock position and I&rsquo;m like, oh, I&rsquo;ve got, I&rsquo;ve got enough altitudes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to, I&rsquo;m going to cut across the circle.</p>
<p>I tell the guy in my back seat, dude, I&rsquo;m going to, I&rsquo;m going to do this.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, go for it.</p>
<p>Skip.</p>
<p>Cause I was a skipper.</p>
<p>So I cut across the bottom.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m kind of almost coming out coaltitude as this thing&rsquo;s coming up, I&rsquo;m going to meet</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m driving and I get to probably it&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m probably about a half mile away, which</p>
<p>you think, well, a half mile is pretty far.</p>
<p>Half mile in aviation isn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s I mean, you can tell there&rsquo;s a pilot in an airplane.</p>
<p>You can see all kinds of stuff at a half mile.</p>
<p>You can see pretty good detail.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like right there and it&rsquo;s coming across my nose.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m basically pointing back towards east.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m cutting across cause I&rsquo;m going to the three oclock position.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at two oclock and I&rsquo;m going to meet it at three oclock.</p>
<p>So as I do this, it goes, it just accelerates and disappears.</p>
<p>So this happens at around, estimating about 12,000 feet.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re at 20.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve got about 8,000 foot of altitude above us when this happens.</p>
<p>And it just, as it crosses our nose, it just, it accelerates and literally in less than,</p>
<p>you know, probably less than a half second, it just goes and it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re like, and I had the first thing is, dude, did you guys see it?</p>
<p>The other airplane&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t, we have no idea where it&rsquo;s at.</p>
<p>So we kind of spin around real quick.</p>
<p>I go, well, let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s down here.</p>
<p>And I turn around and we&rsquo;re looking for the whitewater and we can&rsquo;t even, the whitewater&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally all blue.</p>
<p>So now you go.</p>
<p>And I remember telling the guy in my backseat, like a dude, I&rsquo;m, I don&rsquo;t know about you,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m pretty weirded out because this is, I mean, you know, I had at the time like 30</p>
<p>some hundred hours of flying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d been doing it for 18 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nothing like anything you&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>So as we turn, we go, well, let&rsquo;s just go back, you know, because now I got to put on</p>
<p>my real hat, which we have to train because we&rsquo;re getting ready to deploy to overseas.</p>
<p>So we got to get our training done.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my mindset, especially as a CEO, cause I got to get, I got to get training</p>
<p>out of the flight time because I&rsquo;m responsible to do that.</p>
<p>So, Hey, let&rsquo;s go back.</p>
<p>And the, the, the guy who&rsquo;s going to be the bad guys is the CEO of the Marine squadron.</p>
<p>And so Cheeks is at the, he&rsquo;s listening to all this happen, you know, cause he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>like, cause he, they, when he first went out, they were going to do him, but the little</p>
<p>Hornets, the legacy Hornets, the F18Cs don&rsquo;t have as much gas as the Super Hornets.</p>
<p>So he had launched first and they were going to do him.</p>
<p>And then when they knew we were off the deck, they just told him, hey, go to your cap point</p>
<p>down South, and we&rsquo;re going to send, we&rsquo;ll pass this off to the Super Hornets.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a cap point by the way?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we hold.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s called a combat air patrol point.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re just going to hold at one end.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to hold at the other end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like, Hey, you guys are going to get, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, if it&rsquo;s a football field,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to sit on one goal line.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to sit on the other goal line.</p>
<p>And when they say go, we&rsquo;re going to run at each other and then try and do something in</p>
<p>the middle of the field and then go back to our set reset points.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking to him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s listening to the, he&rsquo;s just listening.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t talk to him at all.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just listening.</p>
<p>He just dials up.</p>
<p>Cause they know that we all know the frequencies.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s listening to what&rsquo;s going on because he&rsquo;s like, cause they canceled training.</p>
<p>So what else is he going to do?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just going to hang out there and do circles while he&rsquo;s waiting for him and his wingman.</p>
<p>So they just, they&rsquo;re listening to all this go on.</p>
<p>And then at this point you move on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We come back up to train.</p>
<p>We go back as we&rsquo;re flying back the controller.</p>
<p>Cause we&rsquo;re talking to the kid on the Princeton, the, the, uh, the, uh, they&rsquo;re called OSs</p>
<p>or operations specialists.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the ones that run the radars and we&rsquo;re talking to him and he&rsquo;s like, Hey, sir, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to believe this.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, that thing is at your cap.</p>
<p>It showed back up.</p>
<p>It just popped up.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>This is like 60 miles away.</p>
<p>It just reappears.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, Oh, okay.</p>
<p>So we got the radars out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking for it.</p>
<p>Uh, we get out there.</p>
<p>We never see it.</p>
<p>We never see it again.</p>
<p>Uh, we do what we need to do.</p>
<p>We come back to the ship.</p>
<p>Of course, now we&rsquo;re like, Oh, this is going to be, we&rsquo;re going to, you know, I told him,</p>
<p>I told him, I go, dude, you know, we&rsquo;re going to catch, we&rsquo;re going to catch shit for this.</p>
<p>When we get back to the ship, word&rsquo;s going to get out and we&rsquo;re just going to catch maximum</p>
<p>shit.</p>
<p>And we did.</p>
<p>We were joking, you know, so the ship plays movies, we have movies on the boat and they</p>
<p>do 12 hours of movies.</p>
<p>So they repeat cause there&rsquo;s a day check and a night check.</p>
<p>So the same movies in the morning and night play.</p>
<p>So you never get to ever get to watch a whole movie on the boat, which drives my wife crazy</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;ll watch stuff on TV that way too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be like, Oh, Hey, I&rsquo;ve seen this and it, I&rsquo;ll jump into a movie in the middle and</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;ll pick it up later and I&rsquo;ll see the beginning and I&rsquo;ll put it all together, uh,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how we have to do it.</p>
<p>Cause we&rsquo;re so busy.</p>
<p>Well, the movies became, and I, it was men in black, aliens, uh, uh, independence day.</p>
<p>Definitely going to catch some shit, but let, let, uh, let me just ask some dumb questions.</p>
<p>So just take him, cause it&rsquo;s whatever, whatever the heck you saw, whatever the heck happened,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, you know, one of the most fascinating things, um, events in recent history.</p>
<p>So whatever it was, it&rsquo;s interesting to talk about it, different kinds of angles.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no good answers, but it&rsquo;s interesting to ask some dumb questions here.</p>
<p>Uh, so first of all, you mentioned, see, you saw at some point X, Y, and then, uh, somebody</p>
<p>in the Princeton said, you&rsquo;re not going to believe this, sir.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at your cap point that that&rsquo;s a different place.</p>
<p>How the heck did it know what your cap point is?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the one of you to no one, you know, you don&rsquo;t, we don&rsquo;t tell it, we don&rsquo;t broadcast</p>
<p>it, we have a waypoint in the system, but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe it knew where we were going.</p>
<p>Cause we use the same one day after day after day, but it, it obviously knew, but you never</p>
<p>saw it there.</p>
<p>Never saw it there.</p>
<p>Chad, when he took off, when he got the video, we landed, we told them, Hey, look, we just,</p>
<p>we just chased this thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, what?</p>
<p>I got to chase it.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, well, I go, dude, and I go, and I told him, I said, dude, get video.</p>
<p>And he goes, and so, and that&rsquo;s how he is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m going to go.</p>
<p>And he, he was, he, he was determined that he was going to find this thing.</p>
<p>So when you look at his video, and this is the stuff that isn&rsquo;t out, that they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see because not all the, all you see is the FLIR tape.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the targeting pod, the forward looking infrared receiver.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably overlay the video for people to see.</p>
<p>When he goes out, it&rsquo;s you know, what he&rsquo;s looking at on his displays is he has basically</p>
<p>two radar displays up.</p>
<p>He has azimuth and range on the right one, and he has azimuth and elevation on the left</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>So this is called the Azel display.</p>
<p>And this is called, this is basically the PPI, which is the, you&rsquo;re at the bottom of</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re at the bottom of the square.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really taken this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taken a cone because a radar really looks left and right from a point and it squares</p>
<p>it out.</p>
<p>So the entire bottom of the scope that we look at is us because they do this.</p>
<p>They square it off.</p>
<p>So, so he goes out and when he first sees it, he gets a radar return on it because when</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not trying to lock it.</p>
<p>So the radar is just throwing energy out and getting it, you know, it&rsquo;s a Doppler radar.</p>
<p>So when it&rsquo;s in search mode, that&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going, oh, I can see you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s looking for return.</p>
<p>So he gets a return.</p>
<p>So he wants to see what it is because all you get is a little green square, unless it</p>
<p>builds a track file on it, but a little green square is just sitting there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not moving because it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s sitting in one spot in space.</p>
<p>He locks it up when he goes to lock it up.</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s putting a bunch of energy on it, but he&rsquo;s telling the radar, stare down that</p>
<p>line of sight and whatever&rsquo;s there, I want you to grab it and build a track file on it,</p>
<p>which will tell us how high it is, how fast it is and the direction that it&rsquo;s going.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So the radar is smart enough that when the signal comes back, if it&rsquo;s been messed with,</p>
<p>it will tell you, it&rsquo;ll give you indications that I&rsquo;m being jammed.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s all it is, is you send a signal out, something, it manipulates the signal</p>
<p>either in range and velocity or whatever, and it sends it back and the radar was smart</p>
<p>enough to go, that is not a return that I&rsquo;m expecting.</p>
<p>Something&rsquo;s messing with me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being jammed.</p>
<p>And it shows you and it puts strobes up, it gives these lines on the radar and it does</p>
<p>some stuff.</p>
<p>So you can mean, well, it does, it goes full into, it&rsquo;s being jammed at about every mode</p>
<p>you can possibly see because everything comes up and this aspect gets along, it&rsquo;s all kinds</p>
<p>of, I don&rsquo;t want to get into details, but you can tell it&rsquo;s being jammed.</p>
<p>So and it&rsquo;s what it does.</p>
<p>As you said on Rogan, by the way, that jamming is an act of war, right?</p>
<p>Active jamming is, when you actively jam another platform, yes, it&rsquo;s technically an act of</p>
<p>war.</p>
<p>It feels like you should be freaking out at this point, I mean.</p>
<p>So well, he does it and then in the back seat, so they don&rsquo;t have a stick and throttle, they</p>
<p>have their side stick controllers so they can control all the sensors and they can just</p>
<p>toggle around and do stuff.</p>
<p>So he has the ability to just move one switch real quick and it will go from that azimuth</p>
<p>elevation on the radar to the targeting pod.</p>
<p>Well, as soon as he commanded the radar to look at that target, the targeting pod goes,</p>
<p>oh, what&rsquo;s over there?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll stare because it goes down the line of sight because all the systems are hooked</p>
<p>together.</p>
<p>You can decouple them, but they&rsquo;re going to automatically couple up.</p>
<p>So when he castles over, it&rsquo;s a switch, it looks like a castle switch, what&rsquo;s a castle?</p>
<p>So when he moves that thing to the left and he swaps the displays out and he says, instead</p>
<p>of looking at the radar, I want to look at the targeting pod, he sees it on the targeting</p>
<p>pod because the targeting pod&rsquo;s already looking there.</p>
<p>And now he&rsquo;s on a passive track because he&rsquo;s not literally sending any energy out, he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just receiving IR energy from the tic tac and then the system itself will track the</p>
<p>pixels and the contrast differences, it depends on what mode you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>So it says, oh, and that&rsquo;s where those little bars you see in the video where the bars come</p>
<p>up left and right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s doing some vision based tracking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what it is.</p>
<p>So and then he goes through.</p>
<p>Changes zooms, changes the mode.</p>
<p>He goes through all the modes, so there&rsquo;s a narrow, medium and wide.</p>
<p>So wide is far away, medium and then narrow.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the TV mode and he goes from IR mode to the TV mode.</p>
<p>The cool thing with the TV mode is narrow IR mode is only medium TV mode.</p>
<p>So you can actually get closer with narrow TV mode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a better zoom capability when you go into TV mode.</p>
<p>So he goes through all those things and that&rsquo;s when you see it going from a black background</p>
<p>to a white background.</p>
<p>So you can figure out what the heck is this?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, and he wants to get as much data as he can on it based on the different modes</p>
<p>instead of just staring at it going, what is that thing?</p>
<p>So the video has been out, it actually was on YouTube for years before the government</p>
<p>released it.</p>
<p>It was leaked in 2007?</p>
<p>No, the guy that was in my backseat sent me an email and I had retired.</p>
<p>So this is about, nope, because I was working down in San Diego.</p>
<p>So this is about 2008, early 2009, he sends me a link to strangeland.com, which is not</p>
<p>suitable for work.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, it&rsquo;s top notch.</p>
<p>And he says, I can remember the email, hey Skip, does this look familiar?</p>
<p>And I look at it, I&rsquo;m like, how the hell did that get on strangeland.com?</p>
<p>So next thing you know, it ends up on YouTube, which was cool because you can send a YouTube</p>
<p>link to someone.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t send strangeland.com to someone because you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>get.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Googling kittens.</p>
<p>So it ends up there somehow.</p>
<p>So it gets on YouTube, which was cool because I would go out with my friends and we&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>drinking and they go, dude, what&rsquo;s the coolest thing you ever saw flying?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like you were asking what it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>And I go, oh dude, I chased a UFO and they&rsquo;re like, get out.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, no, serious.</p>
<p>This is literally how it happened.</p>
<p>So I was sitting with my friend Matt.</p>
<p>So Matt and I did our, he was the guy in my right seat of the A6 when I did my very first</p>
<p>night trap.</p>
<p>And we were friends to this day.</p>
<p>Because when you do stuff like people like that, I had to have faith in him, he had to</p>
<p>have faith in me, they become like your brother.</p>
<p>And these are guys that literally, I don&rsquo;t talk to them on a regular basis, like Chris</p>
<p>who works at Apple.</p>
<p>If Chris called me up tomorrow and said, dude, I need help.</p>
<p>I need this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like, all right, let&rsquo;s figure this out and let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re like family, you do it.</p>
<p>And most Navy guys, we don&rsquo;t send letters to each other weekly.</p>
<p>You know, I have friends that I haven&rsquo;t talked to in 10 years that they showed up on my door,</p>
<p>you know, pop a bottle of wine, grab a beer, shoot the shit, take about first 10 minutes</p>
<p>to catch up.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s like old times and it&rsquo;s amazing how fast it&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m out to dinner with Matt and I&rsquo;m telling him this story and he&rsquo;s like, get out of here.</p>
<p>So he goes back and he tells our friend Paco, Paco has fightersweep.com, it&rsquo;s a blog site.</p>
<p>So Paco&rsquo;s obsessed, like he is way into UFOs.</p>
<p>So Paco calls me up, he says, dude, I was talking to Matty.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we call him.</p>
<p>He goes, I was talking to Matty.</p>
<p>He goes, dude, you got to tell me this story.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, all right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to spend a chunk of time and so he calls me one day and I&rsquo;m like, I got to</p>
<p>get a voicemail.</p>
<p>Hey, give me a call.</p>
<p>So I call him up and he answers the phone, but I could hear people in the background</p>
<p>and I go, hey dude, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>He goes, hang on, hang on.</p>
<p>I got to put you on speakerphone.</p>
<p>I go, what are you putting me on speakerphone?</p>
<p>He goes, you got to tell the story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having a dinner party.</p>
<p>You got to tell the story.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s literally having a dinner party with his cell phone in the middle of the table</p>
<p>as I tell a Tic Tac story.</p>
<p>So he calls me up again.</p>
<p>He says, hey, I got this blog and he just writes about fighter stuff.</p>
<p>Like he wrote about that we call them the shit hot break.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a guy that when you&rsquo;re laying on a carrier, comes in, turns and gets ready to</p>
<p>land really fast.</p>
<p>Like breaks it off right at the back of the ship and one of the guys, when we were junior</p>
<p>officers on the USS Ranger, one of the department heads in the other squadron is a guy, Nasty.</p>
<p>And Nasty was notorious for coming in in a Tomcat and cranking off the shit hot break.</p>
<p>So he literally wrote a thing about the shit hot break with Nasty and there&rsquo;s another guy,</p>
<p>Mav, was one of our landing signals officers for the air wing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good article on how this was and how it kind of forms you in Naval Aviation, kind</p>
<p>of being part of the club.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s like, I got to write about this thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what do you guys, I got to write about it.</p>
<p>I go, all right.</p>
<p>Because at first I would say no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, dude, I don&rsquo;t want this out there.</p>
<p>Just.</p>
<p>So you haven&rsquo;t really before then talked about it much.</p>
<p>My wife didn&rsquo;t even really know the whole story.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Just as a comment, is it just because you caught some.</p>
<p>You know, it was just, I&rsquo;ll tell you what, three days we had the incident for about two</p>
<p>days.</p>
<p>They played the goofy movies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a comic on the back of the air wing schedule that they would put.</p>
<p>It was like first one was a far side and the second one was me and the guy in my back seat</p>
<p>and it was men in black, but it had our names, you know, protecting protecting the Nimitz</p>
<p>battle group type stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just funny shit like that.</p>
<p>So to me it wasn&rsquo;t that big of a deal.</p>
<p>It was like, okay, that&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re never going to know what it was.</p>
<p>I want to get out there because this is important because there&rsquo;s all kinds of rumors.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a group of folks there.</p>
<p>No one ever came out in suits to talk to us.</p>
<p>Nobody looking like me.</p>
<p>No came out on a, no, no one came out of the helicopter.</p>
<p>No one came out on an airplane.</p>
<p>You know, you get, oh, I was told to turn over this classified.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s funny is all the COs and several of them are still in the Navy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one that is a, he, I think he just finished up.</p>
<p>He was a captain of an aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>You know, so he&rsquo;ll end up making Admiral and all that stuff.</p>
<p>Those guys are all my friends.</p>
<p>I talk to them daily.</p>
<p>Just to clarify.</p>
<p>So just for people who don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s a story that both on the Nimitz and the Princeton</p>
<p>folks in a helicopter landed.</p>
<p>They showed up, they took the data, quote unquote.</p>
<p>So all the sort of recordings associated with this incident and they took it and presumably</p>
<p>deleted it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a kind of story to that.</p>
<p>And then from what I&rsquo;ve seen, you said that you believe, just like we were talking about</p>
<p>offline, that jokes spread faster than, or just rumors spread faster than anything on</p>
<p>these ships, that it might&rsquo;ve been a joke that started and.</p>
<p>Well, they did.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the joke.</p>
<p>So they had come down, right?</p>
<p>We had the tapes and they were Chad&rsquo;s tapes.</p>
<p>So we use those tapes over and over again.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re consumable, but remember, I have a budget as a squadron, so I have a budget.</p>
<p>So I have to buy those tapes, all that stuff that we use, I&rsquo;m accountable for.</p>
<p>And the tapes are actually classified secret because of the data that&rsquo;s on them.</p>
<p>So we had the tapes.</p>
<p>So the intelligence guys, the intel officers came down from what&rsquo;s called Civic, CVIC,</p>
<p>which is Carrier Intel Center, came down and said, hey, we need the tapes.</p>
<p>These guys are gonna come, they&rsquo;re gonna come and get them.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m like, oh, whatever.</p>
<p>So we hand them the tapes and then someone, because I have, you know people, shortly after</p>
<p>they came and got the tapes, someone came to me and said, you know, they&rsquo;re messing</p>
<p>with you, they&rsquo;re playing a joke.</p>
<p>So I said, oh, well, let&rsquo;s see how well that goes because I&rsquo;m a CO and they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>So I went down to Civic and it was a, I think he was a Lieutenant or Lieutenant JG, so he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>way junior to me.</p>
<p>And I said, hey, I want my tapes back and he looks at me and I go, I know you guys are</p>
<p>pulling my leg.</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s no one came out.</p>
<p>And I go, and you have about 30 seconds to get me my tapes before I start tearing this</p>
<p>place apart.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s literally what I told him.</p>
<p>And I said, and if your boss has an issue, he can come and see me because it&rsquo;s not gonna</p>
<p>go well.</p>
<p>I said, because this is bullshit and I need those tapes.</p>
<p>Then he literally walked right over to a filing cabinet, opened it up, they weren&rsquo;t in a safe.</p>
<p>He opened up a filing cabinet and pulled them out and handed them to me.</p>
<p>I said, and I basically said a few things to him, like, don&rsquo;t ever fuck with me again.</p>
<p>And I left, I had the tapes.</p>
<p>So this, no one came out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no flying going on when all this is happening.</p>
<p>And I took the tapes back and then I copied the tapes.</p>
<p>So I took two brand new eight mil tapes and I copied the sections that I want.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a rumor or two that, oh, the original FLIR video is 10 minutes long and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some, one of these petty officers is saying, I saw it, that&rsquo;s total crap.</p>
<p>The original video is about a minute, 30 seconds long.</p>
<p>What you see on the release video is the entire video.</p>
<p>So you have mentioned, I apologize if I say stupid things, please correct me, but you</p>
<p>have mentioned that, like on Roguen, I think that you watched it on a bigger screen.</p>
<p>It felt like it was higher definition.</p>
<p>So let me ask the question, is there a higher definition version, do you think, of the FLIR</p>
<p>video that would give us more pixels and more information presumably because of the high</p>
<p>number of.</p>
<p>I would doubt it.</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t know where, the stuff that the government released, I don&rsquo;t know where</p>
<p>they got it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So the stuff that was on Strangeland and YouTube, someone pulled off of a secret, it looks like</p>
<p>a rack.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s tape machines in there and it gets converted to digital and stored on a hard</p>
<p>drive and they pulled it off that hard drive and they put it on YouTube.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s just like, anytime, even a digital media, the more you copy digital media, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some quality that gets, it degrades.</p>
<p>So this, you don&rsquo;t know how many times this has been copied.</p>
<p>So we were looking, the videos I&rsquo;ve seen are right off the original, they&rsquo;re Hi8 tapes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically pulled off the back of the display, so it&rsquo;s not filmed with cameras,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s literally a digital feed that&rsquo;s pulled off the back and put onto a Hi8 tape.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how the recorders work.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s actually digital to digital, it&rsquo;s not even on tapes anymore, it&rsquo;s a digital</p>
<p>recording system, but we were still in that process of slowly, because originally we had</p>
<p>little cameras here that shine, so if the light hit, it would wash out the displays.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a pretty good feed, when you put it on, so instead of looking at it on your tiny</p>
<p>little computer monitor or whatever, I&rsquo;m looking at it on like a 19 inch, because it was still</p>
<p>normal TVs back there, we had just put flat screens in the ready room that I had bought,</p>
<p>so we could watch movies.</p>
<p>A nice, huge 19 inch screen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s maybe 20, it was nice.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>It was gigantic.</p>
<p>I can get for like 50 bucks, you can get like 60 inches.</p>
<p>This is 2005.</p>
<p>So you look at it as this big thing.</p>
<p>You could see, so when you get to the TV mode, when I say there&rsquo;s little things coming out</p>
<p>of the bottom of it, you could see those.</p>
<p>It was very clear.</p>
<p>But in terms of the actual visual on the Tic Tac, did you get much more information from</p>
<p>the higher, from the clear?</p>
<p>Little things out of the bottom.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t see those visuals.</p>
<p>So the bottom information.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>So when you see it, because he&rsquo;s coming almost coaltitude with it, you can see the bottom</p>
<p>of it.</p>
<p>It looks like little, you know, like if you look at a Cessna, there&rsquo;s little antennas</p>
<p>hanging out of the bottom.</p>
<p>Kind of like that.</p>
<p>There was two little things out of the bottom.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing on the top.</p>
<p>There was no plume, no IR, no visible propulsions, even heat signature.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s all that stuff.</p>
<p>And then the other thing that people didn&rsquo;t see is they didn&rsquo;t see the radar display,</p>
<p>which that really raises a classification of it, especially to see what the radar does</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s being jammed.</p>
<p>You know, matter of fact, when they did the unofficial official investigation in about</p>
<p>2000 and let me think about 2009.</p>
<p>I got a call on my cell phone from a guy who government employee and said, hey, he told</p>
<p>me who he was.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still in the government.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m friends with him.</p>
<p>And he said, hey, we&rsquo;re going to investigate your Tic Tac thing.</p>
<p>This is literally five years later.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Five years later.</p>
<p>And I said, OK, whatever.</p>
<p>And he did a pretty good job.</p>
<p>I caught the unofficial official report because it was really never official.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll give you the history of why I say that and why it never came out in FOIA requests.</p>
<p>So he does the report.</p>
<p>He sent me the report.</p>
<p>And all he said is, hey, I&rsquo;m going to send you this report.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t distribute this report.</p>
<p>I said, OK.</p>
<p>The report is now out because Harry Reid got it to George Knapp and they were good enough</p>
<p>to redact it.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a few versions of it unredacted and I&rsquo;m very protective of the other people</p>
<p>that were involved in this.</p>
<p>So Jim has talked, but he&rsquo;s off the grid.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t talk to anyone now.</p>
<p>The pilot of his airplane, she has come out on unidentified, but they don&rsquo;t release her</p>
<p>name, although people are starting to do it.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s had weird shit happen around her house.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s got kids, you know, so I&rsquo;m very protective of her.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve told people like Jeremy and George, if I know that the names ever came from you,</p>
<p>I will never talk to you again about this.</p>
<p>And Jeremy&rsquo;s been really good about it.</p>
<p>And so is George.</p>
<p>And then, but George knew who the names were because he got the report from Senator Reid.</p>
<p>And then the other crew.</p>
<p>So the pilot of the airplane that took the video that Chad was in, if you talk to that</p>
<p>individual, they really don&rsquo;t have the recollection.</p>
<p>They were just out flying that day and it wasn&rsquo;t a big deal.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s you need to protect because not everyone wants people knocking.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want people knocking on my door and, you know, and there&rsquo;s rumors are you talk</p>
<p>to everyone.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re about the 23rd person that I&rsquo;ve talked to total.</p>
<p>And that includes, you know, the newspapers and stuff.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been selective because there&rsquo;s so much, I mean, if I turned down like, I turned</p>
<p>down Russian TV.</p>
<p>I can give you her name when we&rsquo;re done here.</p>
<p>She called, she not only called me, she called my wife, she called my daughter, she called</p>
<p>my son and she called my son in law because they&rsquo;re persistent.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m pretty protected.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very particular.</p>
<p>I mean, the reason I&rsquo;m talking to you is because I knew we would have a conversation that wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>based just on the tic tac and the incident, but we can actually talk about some of the</p>
<p>science and some of the theoretical to get into, to get more people involved to go.</p>
<p>Cause I think there&rsquo;s, you know, and when you talk to, you know, Lou Elizondo or Chris</p>
<p>Mellon, you know, the group at TTSA, you know, that whole thing, that&rsquo;s to the stars Academy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Tom DeLonge group that got started.</p>
<p>So you go, well, you know, cause I think Tom has caught a lot of crap for this, but he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually, when you talk to him, he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s very smart and I asked him, how&rsquo;d you</p>
<p>get into this?</p>
<p>And he goes, oh, when I was traveling around with Blink 182, he goes, you read a lot of</p>
<p>books when you&rsquo;re laying in a van as you&rsquo;re driving to your next gig before you make it</p>
<p>big.</p>
<p>And he goes, and he read, he was reading books and he read one of them on UFOs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to think of the title.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the big ones that&rsquo;s out there real popular.</p>
<p>And so he started just, he started asking more and through his fame with Blink 182 in</p>
<p>the band, he got more and more connected.</p>
<p>You know, if you talk to Chris Mellon, who is an undersecretary of defense for intelligence</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s part of the Mellon dynasty, you know, from Carnegie Mellon type, very, very smart.</p>
<p>He knows, he, he, he definitely knows how the government works cause he worked there.</p>
<p>And so when I went down to DC to talk to people, he&rsquo;s one of the first people I&rsquo;ll go to.</p>
<p>When I did Tucker Carlson about a month ago, month and a half ago, I asked, he texted me,</p>
<p>I texted him, Tom, Lou to go, Hey, cause they were like, you gotta do it.</p>
<p>Cause I turned to, I turned Tucker down a couple of times before and his, his producer</p>
<p>had called me and I&rsquo;m like, all right, I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>Because those guys like, you gotta, you gotta do this for us.</p>
<p>So from my perspective, just to give you some context.</p>
<p>So to me, there seems to be some stigma.</p>
<p>So I come from the scientific community and I really appreciate you talking to me today.</p>
<p>And I think that people who listen to this include, you know, of faculty, fellow faculty</p>
<p>at MIT and major universities.</p>
<p>And it feels like there&rsquo;s some stigma to the subject from, from the scientific community.</p>
<p>A lot of people, especially when they hear your story are like, wow, this is really interesting,</p>
<p>but you, you don&rsquo;t even know you, one, you&rsquo;re afraid to talk about it.</p>
<p>And two, you don&rsquo;t know what the next steps are, like how can we seriously try to think</p>
<p>about what you saw, how to think about how we further look for things like it, how we</p>
<p>develop systems and plans for how in the future we can immediately collect a lot more data</p>
<p>and try to react properly, you know, try to communicate, try to interpret this in the</p>
<p>best way possible from the scientific perspective.</p>
<p>And I, I just would love to remove stigma from this subject.</p>
<p>Well, I think that&rsquo;s the first step we have done in this country, an absolutely terrible</p>
<p>job with these things.</p>
<p>So you go, and I joke, you know, go back to Roswell.</p>
<p>So the first reports that came out of Roswell was we have this crash flying saucer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s literally what came out.</p>
<p>And then magically the next day it&rsquo;s a weather balloon and they&rsquo;re showing your pieces of</p>
<p>mylar and you go, well, that doesn&rsquo;t look like what they showed us yesterday.</p>
<p>Then you get into Project Blue Book, you know, so there&rsquo;s that whole series about Project</p>
<p>Blue Book.</p>
<p>But the bottom line of Project Blue Book is it really did two things.</p>
<p>It investigated sightings and it did everything it could to debunk and disprove to the point</p>
<p>where it actually went to discredit, you know, to make you look.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s always been this, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;d call it an aura around it or a mystique</p>
<p>about UFOs that if you&rsquo;re talking about them, they&rsquo;re nuts.</p>
<p>With ours, because I&rsquo;m not a UFO guy, I&rsquo;m not a junkie.</p>
<p>If you ask me, do I believe that there&rsquo;s life outside of Earth, I would say you probably</p>
<p>have a better chance of winning the mega ball lottery than we&rsquo;re the only planet that has</p>
<p>life on it in the universe.</p>
<p>The odds are against it.</p>
<p>If you do just do the math, you have to accept, because there only has to be one other planet</p>
<p>that has life on it and then I win and you lose.</p>
<p>And then more and more science is showing that there&rsquo;s habitable planets out there,</p>
<p>that yeah, everything we&rsquo;ve learned so far, we know very little, but everything we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>learned so far about the planets out there, exoplanets, Earth like planets, it seems that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very likely that there&rsquo;s life out there.</p>
<p>Intelligent life is another topic, but life.</p>
<p>Well, we as humans, you know, and even more as Americans, we have this hubris about us</p>
<p>that says, ha ha, we&rsquo;re it and you go, not so much.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;re not so intelligent.</p>
<p>Because we are, it&rsquo;s just how we learn.</p>
<p>So our main mode of transportation and what people figured out years ago was the internal</p>
<p>combustion engine, which led us to jet engines and solid rocket fuel.</p>
<p>What if you&rsquo;re in another planet where you figured out the ability to create a gravity</p>
<p>field or you used, you know, because electromagnetics are becoming bigger and bigger and bigger,</p>
<p>you know, catapults on ships were steam powered and the new Gerald Ford is electromagnetic.</p>
<p>Roller coasters used to use a chain to get you to the top of the hill.</p>
<p>Now they shoot you with electromagnetics and you&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a whole new realm of propulsion that, you know, sometimes it&rsquo;s our ability</p>
<p>to develop the technology to support theory.</p>
<p>You know, we are just now proving, you know, recently theories that Einstein had where</p>
<p>people actually joked about them.</p>
<p>And now we actually have the technology to prove that gravity can bend light.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ve proven that.</p>
<p>So you look at that way and you go, well, does that mean that, you know, 70 years ago</p>
<p>Einstein was wrong or 80 years ago Einstein was wrong?</p>
<p>Or do you go, we just didn&rsquo;t have the ability to look that deep into space to actually find</p>
<p>something that we could, to actually measure.</p>
<p>And you know, and I&rsquo;ve seen this stuff.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just a hundred years and the kind of things that can happen in a few centuries.</p>
<p>Look what we&rsquo;ve done in the last 20 years.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Let me direct, cause it&rsquo;s such an interesting topic from a career perspective, from a science</p>
<p>perspective, you&rsquo;re, I mean, you&rsquo;ve spoken, you&rsquo;ve been brave in, you know, telling your</p>
<p>story, not some dramatic thing, but just telling the things you&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>Did it encounter, did it impact your career?</p>
<p>Is that why more people haven&rsquo;t come out?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;ve mentioned Roswell, like how, what advice do you give to people, to the community,</p>
<p>to me as a scientist for ways to go forward about this topic and still have a, you know,</p>
<p>not being put in a bin in society that he&rsquo;s a loon or she&rsquo;s a loon or that person.</p>
<p>Mine is to get away from the little green men, just divorce the two little green men.</p>
<p>And you know, and I&rsquo;ve talked to Lou Elizondo about this, you know, and the group that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>working with, which is incredible.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;ve got Steve Justice who used to run Skunk Works where they built, you know,</p>
<p>projects.</p>
<p>Now, Lou Elizondo, as you mentioned, was a program director.</p>
<p>He ran the ATIP program at the Pentagon.</p>
<p>And ATIP was a program that was tasked with investigating any kind of UFOs, UAPs.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s funny is the unofficial official report that I joke about, the guy who wrote</p>
<p>the unofficial official report was actually an original member of ATIP.</p>
<p>And the original stuff that ATIP did was FOIA exempt.</p>
<p>And people go, how do you know that?</p>
<p>I go, because I stood there with the memo in my hand that said these are, it literally,</p>
<p>I watched the DOD memo that said it and it was signed.</p>
<p>So he was one.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why the, that&rsquo;s why I call it the unofficial official report.</p>
<p>It was never, it was never releasable because people go, oh, I put in a FOIA request and</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get that.</p>
<p>I go, well, just because you put in a FOIA request and get it, I go, because how much,</p>
<p>how much time do you think that guy is going to spend to get you the information that you</p>
<p>requested if he can&rsquo;t find it?</p>
<p>I actually got called by the Navy.</p>
<p>I had a commander in the Navy call me about right before the article came out in the New</p>
<p>York Times.</p>
<p>It was, this was starting to come back and she had called me because there&rsquo;s been, there</p>
<p>was a FOIA request for stuff about the Nimitz incident.</p>
<p>And I said, do you know of anything?</p>
<p>She called me, she goes, do you know of anything else besides the situation reports that come</p>
<p>off the ship?</p>
<p>And you know, and you got to remember when the situation report comes off the ship, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like third hand.</p>
<p>So we tell someone, they tell someone, that person has to write it up.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s all kinds of inaccuracies in it.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s the unofficial official report that&rsquo;s actually pretty well written.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some errors in it, but it was, you know, I didn&rsquo;t help write it.</p>
<p>I just did it.</p>
<p>And he did a really good job of researching it and figuring out who&rsquo;s who in the zoo and</p>
<p>the players.</p>
<p>So she called me and said, is there anything out there?</p>
<p>And I said, officially out there.</p>
<p>She said, yes.</p>
<p>I said, I don&rsquo;t know anything.</p>
<p>I knew of the unofficial official report, which is that one, but I&rsquo;m not, you know,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t know about it, I&rsquo;m not going to tell you because it&rsquo;s not my job and nor</p>
<p>did I care.</p>
<p>I mean, did, in that whole situation, you mentioned Lou, I mean, did you think about</p>
<p>your impact to your career?</p>
<p>Just to get back to the question, do you think others, other pilots, other thing, other people</p>
<p>like in the Roosevelt are thinking about this kind of thing, why aren&rsquo;t they talking about</p>
<p>this?</p>
<p>Why are people afraid to talk about this?</p>
<p>Well, honestly, the military and the press, there&rsquo;s a distrust.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just tell you that right now.</p>
<p>We typically don&rsquo;t like talking to the press because if I talk to you, you know, especially</p>
<p>when I do, even the TV shows, you know, cause I&rsquo;ve been on a couple of shows, when you look</p>
<p>at it, you know, they come to my house and they film me for two hours.</p>
<p>And then what you see on the screen is five minutes.</p>
<p>Well, and the other thing with the press, let me give you my perspective from Autonomous</p>
<p>Vehicles is the clipping happens, yes.</p>
<p>But also the incompetence.</p>
<p>Let me just call out journalists.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not thinking, I mean, so here&rsquo;s the thing, I have a PhD and I&rsquo;ve taken painfully</p>
<p>too many classes from like physics, math, and I also have a deep curiosity about the</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>I read a lot.</p>
<p>That seems to be missing with journalism.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking to a person who is not going to push the story forward in an interesting</p>
<p>way, not the story, but the actual investigation of perhaps one of the most amazing things</p>
<p>that humans have witnessed in history.</p>
<p>Like you, it might&rsquo;ve been nothing, who knows what you witnessed might&rsquo;ve been from a sort</p>
<p>of debunking perspective, might&rsquo;ve been some kind of trick of mind.</p>
<p>You and others have hallucinated something that could be some simple explanation, but</p>
<p>possibly it was something not of this world and to not do justice to this story from a</p>
<p>scientific perspective, it seems at best negligence.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s true for journalists, that&rsquo;s true for other scientists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a human nature.</p>
<p>If we see something that we can&rsquo;t explain, then sometimes if you just, eh, maybe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just me and you let it go away and you don&rsquo;t think about it, maybe it&rsquo;ll just, you ignore</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>The other side is the inquisitive mind that says, well, what was that?</p>
<p>And I want to dig more into it.</p>
<p>And if you look at it or you&rsquo;re going against the norm, you can get ostracized.</p>
<p>And if you look at, and Einstein&rsquo;s the perfect example, I mean, when he started coming up</p>
<p>with some of his theories, some of the top physicists in the world were like, dude, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a nut job.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s literally proving them, but he didn&rsquo;t have, you know, he proved them in theory,</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t have the means to actually do the experiment to prove his theory.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great book that I recommend people read called Proving Einstein Right by Jim</p>
<p>Gates that talks about like the hard work that people try to do years after to try to</p>
<p>experimentally validate the predictions that Einstein made with, with his theories.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>But yes, at the time, it&rsquo;s kind of crazy what he&rsquo;s saying.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you look at it back at the time, don&rsquo;t we, we look at it now and go, well, the guy</p>
<p>was a walking genius and he was, but if you go back in time when he was doing it, it was</p>
<p>like, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>But one of the challenges is your eyewitness.</p>
<p>One of the challenges is you&rsquo;re essentially an eyewitness account.</p>
<p>Like we don&rsquo;t have good data.</p>
<p>We have very limited data of the incident that you&rsquo;ve experienced.</p>
<p>So let me kind of dig in, let me just ask some questions of maybe to see if there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>just to paint more and more of the picture.</p>
<p>One you kind of mentioned, so Tic Tac Shape, let&rsquo;s break apart two situations.</p>
<p>One is the video.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the actual eye account, the eyewitness account that you saw with your</p>
<p>own eyes.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the, what can you say about the shape of the thing?</p>
<p>Is there interesting aspects outside of the Tic Tac?</p>
<p>Like, is there any appendages?</p>
<p>Is there some texture to it that, no smooth white Tic Tac, you know, we don&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see there&rsquo;s no, no wings, no visible propulsion, no windows, no probes that we could see.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t notice, like I said, we don&rsquo;t see the little things on the bottom of it until</p>
<p>we see the video in the TV mode when it&rsquo;s zoomed in, right before it&rsquo;s shortly, you</p>
<p>kind of see them zoom in.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see it typically on the YouTube stuff that&rsquo;s out there, or remember we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking at the original tape, so there&rsquo;s not, there&rsquo;s basically no degradation.</p>
<p>But when you saw with your eyes, there&rsquo;s no kind of appendages.</p>
<p>No, none.</p>
<p>What about, like somebody asked, a lot of people asked you questions.</p>
<p>So I appreciate you spending your time here.</p>
<p>Let me ask some of them.</p>
<p>Did you, I mean, you chased it, so we flew close to it, relatively speaking.</p>
<p>Was there, did you feel any wake?</p>
<p>Like any, did you feel it in any way in terms of your interaction, like aerodynamically?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>So another aspect of it, there&rsquo;s an interesting thing you&rsquo;ve developed a feel for, for objects</p>
<p>in the air.</p>
<p>Did you feel like it was surprised by your arrival?</p>
<p>Or did it, let me ask a few questions around it.</p>
<p>So did you, did it feel like the thing was surprised?</p>
<p>Did it feel like it wanted to be seen, almost to show off its capability?</p>
<p>And did it, what did it feel like relative to if you were doing a, an air fight against</p>
<p>a sort of like a, I don&rsquo;t know, a foreign jet?</p>
<p>So one, I think it, I think it knew we were there when we showed up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like an animal.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever been around deer in a field, you know, the deer will look up and if it</p>
<p>sees you and you&rsquo;re on the other side of the field, it&rsquo;ll actually go no threat and it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>start eating.</p>
<p>You know, they don&rsquo;t put their tail up.</p>
<p>As you move closer to the deer, then it goes, oh, it&rsquo;s there and I&rsquo;m going to react or I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to move.</p>
<p>So as we were up high and it&rsquo;s down doing whatever it was doing, you know, which I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if someone asks, what do you think?</p>
<p>I go, oh, maybe it was communicating with something.</p>
<p>I joked on good morning America.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s like talking to the whales, kind of like Star Trek, you know, and actually</p>
<p>use that clip.</p>
<p>It was kind of funny, but yeah, we&rsquo;re a little human centric.</p>
<p>We think like it would, it&rsquo;d show up to talk to us, but maybe he&rsquo;s talking to the dolphins.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was to whatever, you know, cause it was hanging around that whitewater and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if it was, there&rsquo;s something there as a seamount.</p>
<p>We just didn&rsquo;t find it again.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But once we started to descend and it actually reoriented its longitudinal axis and it started</p>
<p>mirroring us coming up and it was obviously where we were there and it was really coming</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>Just, you know, you figure I&rsquo;m at 20 and it&rsquo;s coming up and it ends up getting up to 12</p>
<p>where I cut across the circle.</p>
<p>I think it was very aware that we were there because it interacted.</p>
<p>We call it a two circle fight when you&rsquo;re fighting another airplane.</p>
<p>But you know, was it, was, were we afraid?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I mean, and to me it was more curious, you know, the curiosity overcomes any fear that</p>
<p>you would have.</p>
<p>And I always felt to be honest, if I was inside the airplane, especially as long as much time</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;d spent inside the airplane flying and doing stuff, I felt totally, it was like a</p>
<p>safe zone.</p>
<p>I mean, I felt totally comfortable inside the airplane as most, you can&rsquo;t, if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in the airplane and you feel scared, it&rsquo;s not the job for you.</p>
<p>You have to feel that because the airplane is part of you now.</p>
<p>You know, I am inside, I have the stick, I have the throttles, I&rsquo;ve got my wizzo in the</p>
<p>back seat, he&rsquo;s running all the displays.</p>
<p>We are a team.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the state of the art airplane, you know, brand new.</p>
<p>You feel pretty good.</p>
<p>And then you get something that, you know, can climb from the surface up and then accelerate</p>
<p>like it did, like it was like no big deal, you know, for an airplane, if you just put</p>
<p>me from a standstill, let&rsquo;s just say slow flight, just get me at a hundred knots above</p>
<p>the water.</p>
<p>And for me to, you can&rsquo;t just start a climb, I&rsquo;d have to lower the nose, I&rsquo;d have to accelerate</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;d have to start coming up and this thing just like, just did it like it was like</p>
<p>no big deal.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You mentioned that like kind of your reaction to it was, it like, it&rsquo;s something that you</p>
<p>would love to fly almost.</p>
<p>So this object, just the curiosity you experienced is like, like what it almost like, what the</p>
<p>heck is that piece of technology and I want to fly it.</p>
<p>Like what made you feel like it&rsquo;s something that you could fly?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s something that a human could fly?</p>
<p>Like in terms of interpreting what you saw as a piece of technology, because another</p>
<p>perspective on it is it was not that the thing under the water was the key thing.</p>
<p>And what you were seeing is some kind of projection or something that like, I don&rsquo;t think it was</p>
<p>a projection.</p>
<p>I think it was a real object.</p>
<p>It was an op, a physical hard object that could be flyed.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think all four of us will tell you the same thing.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t, it wasn&rsquo;t, this was not, cause you go, okay, let&rsquo;s just go on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a light projection.</p>
<p>Well, if we were both sitting next to each other and we were looking at it from the exact</p>
<p>same angle and all that, and I go, okay, there&rsquo;s a, in theory you could have that, but with</p>
<p>an 8,000 foot altitude difference flying, you know, and they&rsquo;re, you know, she&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>not directly above me.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s kind of hanging out watching this whole thing happen.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re getting two different perspectives from two different altitudes over a clear</p>
<p>blue.</p>
<p>You know, if you&rsquo;ve ever been at sea and I don&rsquo;t mean like coast, I mean like when you</p>
<p>get out at sea, the ocean is the bluest, it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;ve got a bright white object over a deep blue ocean that you got pretty</p>
<p>high contrast.</p>
<p>And for this thing just to disappear, it wasn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m telling you, I would, I mean, I know we,</p>
<p>we all have the same recollection of what happened.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s some details because it&rsquo;s so long ago, but for the most part, we know</p>
<p>what we saw and we all came back and looked at each other like, what the hell was that?</p>
<p>What if, I mean, do you think about the thing under the water that&rsquo;s not often talked about</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s something under the water, couldn&rsquo;t have been something gigantic?</p>
<p>It could be.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Like, do you ever think of this?</p>
<p>Big ship comes up.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s why as a person, so I love like swimming out into the ocean by miles</p>
<p>and Olympic swimmers.</p>
<p>Like I love that feeling, but I&rsquo;m also terrified when I swim because the abyss, it could, anything</p>
<p>could be under there.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s not enough focus on that perhaps because there&rsquo;s no visibility, but is it,</p>
<p>is there anything interesting to say about the possibility that was anything underneath</p>
<p>there?</p>
<p>Could be.</p>
<p>I mean, think about it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to hide on this planet, what&rsquo;s the least explored spot on the planet?</p>
<p>Two thirds of it&rsquo;s the ocean.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s literally, I mean, come on, the Malaysia airplane, the triple seven, it was a triple</p>
<p>seven that crashed.</p>
<p>You know, they turned, they didn&rsquo;t go where they&rsquo;re supposed to and they just disappeared</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve been searching for it and they found pieces of it, but you would think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>large objects that, you know, when that thing hit the water, depending on how it broke up,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s big pieces that would be, you&rsquo;d find something, they haven&rsquo;t found anything except</p>
<p>what floated.</p>
<p>So to hide something underwater I think would be easy.</p>
<p>So okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go a little bit in speculation land, but it&rsquo;s the best, it&rsquo;s the best we can do,</p>
<p>which is the basic question of what do you think was it?</p>
<p>So if you had to put money on it, is it like advanced human created technology?</p>
<p>Is it alien technology?</p>
<p>Is it an unknown physical phenomena?</p>
<p>You know, like a ball lightning, for example, there&rsquo;s a lot of fascinating things we probably</p>
<p>humans don&rsquo;t really understand.</p>
<p>Is it like I said, some perception cognition that led you some kind of hallucination that</p>
<p>made you to misinterpret the things you were seeing?</p>
<p>Let me put those things on the table.</p>
<p>Or is it misinterpretation of some known physical phenomena like an ice cloud or something like</p>
<p>that?</p>
<p>What do you think it was?</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s an ice cloud because ice clouds don&rsquo;t fly around and react to you.</p>
<p>Do I think it was a light?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say no, because of the aspects and what we looked and watched it do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say no.</p>
<p>What do you mean by light?</p>
<p>Like a light ball, you know, some type of perception, you know, there&rsquo;s their experience</p>
<p>like plasma, you can do plasma and you can go, oh, I can see it, but it&rsquo;s really not,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s plasma.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>So you would see distortions, I think, as it moved.</p>
<p>Maybe not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a theoretical physicist and some, you know, I&rsquo;m not an MIT.</p>
<p>I would say no, I mean, it looked from all my experience and I had quite a bit of it</p>
<p>when this happened, no, I think it was a hard object.</p>
<p>It was aware that we were there.</p>
<p>It reacted exactly like if I was another airplane and I had to come up and do something exactly</p>
<p>what I would do.</p>
<p>You know, it mirrored me.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t aggressive.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s talk, oh, it flopped behind us.</p>
<p>It was never offensive on us.</p>
<p>It never did that.</p>
<p>It just mirrored us.</p>
<p>So as we&rsquo;re coming down, it&rsquo;s just like, you know, you&rsquo;re kind of, you know, you said you</p>
<p>do martial arts, you know, or wrestling, you know, you see people out on the, when they</p>
<p>get into the ring, especially with collegiate wrestling, cause my roommate in college was</p>
<p>a collegiate wrestler.</p>
<p>So I de facto became a wrestler cause he beat me up every night and we joke.</p>
<p>I talked to him literally probably three, four times a week.</p>
<p>But you know, you see wrestlers when they get out, they kind of, you&rsquo;re kind of feeling</p>
<p>each other as you walk and boxers do the same thing.</p>
<p>It was doing that same thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s going on as it comes around, as it comes around and then it was like, Hey,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to get here.</p>
<p>And then when I got too close to it, you know, it decided I&rsquo;m out of here.</p>
<p>And then it did something that we&rsquo;ve never seen.</p>
<p>The other question is what if I didn&rsquo;t cut across the circle, what if I just kept going</p>
<p>around a circle?</p>
<p>We just keep going.</p>
<p>I could have just watched it.</p>
<p>I mean, my one regret out of the whole thing is we have a camera in our helmet and the</p>
<p>joint helmet.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little camera, but we never use it because it&rsquo;s nauseating to watch because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve ever put a GoPro on someone&rsquo;s head where they&rsquo;re looking around like this all</p>
<p>the time, it&rsquo;ll nauseate you.</p>
<p>So we never turn that on and all, you know, it&rsquo;s the one thing I didn&rsquo;t do is reach down</p>
<p>and hit the switch, you know, and then we didn&rsquo;t go back and cause our tapes didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have anything cause we didn&rsquo;t get it on radar.</p>
<p>Because I tried to lock it up because I can move the radar with my head, but I couldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t lock.</p>
<p>The radar wouldn&rsquo;t lock.</p>
<p>And so, so then the question is, and this is unanswerable, but let&rsquo;s try to get some</p>
<p>hints at it.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s human, like advanced human created technology that&rsquo;s simply top secret</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re just not aware of?</p>
<p>Or is it not something not of this world?</p>
<p>So you, if you&rsquo;d asked me in 2004, I just said, I don&rsquo;t know if you ask me now.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re coming up on 16 years ago for a technology like that, you know, and let&rsquo;s assume that</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t have a conventional propulsion system in it because I don&rsquo;t think it did.</p>
<p>I would like to think that if we had a technology that would advance mankind leaps and bounds</p>
<p>from what we normally do, then it would start coming out.</p>
<p>But to hide something like that for 16 years, you know, and I understand, you know, and</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t speak for the United States government and I never will speak for the United States</p>
<p>government, but I understand how some of that stuff works for classification levels and</p>
<p>why we classify stuff, you know, is it detrimental to national defense?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a point where you have to look and go, if we had a technology like this that</p>
<p>could literally change the way mankind travels, how we get things into space, our ability</p>
<p>to do things, you know, you talk about, you know, are we going to go to Mars?</p>
<p>Well, if you have something that has the ability to go, because remember, these things were</p>
<p>coming down when the cruiser tractor from above 80,000 feet, which is space, and they</p>
<p>would come down and they would come straight down, they&rsquo;d hang out at like 20,000 feet</p>
<p>and then three or four hours later, they&rsquo;d go back up.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have anything that can come down, hang out and once, you know, and I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>hold out in a spot.</p>
<p>Well, we all know there&rsquo;s winds.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not drifting like a balloon.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just sitting there and then they would go back up and they tracked up to the, when</p>
<p>I talked to the controller, he&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;ve seen up to 10 of these things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other guys and it was raining and all this other, let&rsquo;s just say they tracked</p>
<p>a groups of these things coming down, hanging out and going up.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just propulsion and the way it moves, it&rsquo;s also fuel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s everything.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>The whole of it indicates a kind of technology that&rsquo;s highly advanced, but you don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>in your sense that you actually don&rsquo;t know, but you know more than a lot of people, in</p>
<p>your sense, the top secret military technology, if you think about skunkworks, if you think</p>
<p>about it like that, cannot be more than 15 years ahead.</p>
<p>I would say for a leap like that, and a perfect example in modern times is the 117.</p>
<p>Because now a lot of the data on the 117 is out like it was developed at this time.</p>
<p>It flew for this long before it was actually acknowledged by the United States government.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the 117?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the stealth fighter, the original stealth fighter, not the B2, but the stealth fighter.</p>
<p>So you look at that, you know, yeah, you can, I think you can hide things for a while.</p>
<p>But I think a technology, a leap, I mean, this is not a, hey, we developed this and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re kind of pushing the edge of technology.</p>
<p>This is a giant leap in technology.</p>
<p>You know, and the other one is, do we have the basis to do that?</p>
<p>You know, because usually when you have a technology like that, universities, especially</p>
<p>the one you&rsquo;re working at, MIT, a lot of the leading edge stuff is coming out of the top</p>
<p>tier universities, you know, so you&rsquo;ve got MIT, you&rsquo;ve got Caltech, you&rsquo;ve got Stanford,</p>
<p>Georgia Tech, Virginia Tech, Carnegie Mellon, I&rsquo;m just naming schools, Naval Postgraduate</p>
<p>School is another one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s usually indicators, there&rsquo;s papers of, hey, this is where we&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of papers on developing a gravity based propulsion system</p>
<p>that literally, I&rsquo;ve got an object, because how do you, how much power would it cost to</p>
<p>create a gravity field of your own that could actually be strong enough to counter the giant</p>
<p>orb that we live on?</p>
<p>Also by the way, you mentioned gravity based.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of like the hypothesizing that people do in terms of propulsion, like what</p>
<p>kind of propulsion would have to be involved in order to result in that kind of movement.</p>
<p>To me, all the gravity discussion just seems insane from a physics perspective, but of</p>
<p>course it would seem insane until it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Because remember, we only know what we know, which is very little.</p>
<p>Someone has to think out of the box to go, is this possible at all?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying that if you had to bet money, all your money, it would be something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>alien technology, so it&rsquo;s not human created technology.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t like to get into little green men, but I would say that I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>developed it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve developed it.</p>
<p>Because the other one, someone asked me, they said, what if there wasn&rsquo;t, maybe it was just</p>
<p>a drone, maybe it was a UAV that got sent here from someplace else.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve got stuff out there flying around.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;d like to sit around and talk to some of the giant brains that think this stuff</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>I was supposed to be on a podcast with one of them.</p>
<p>Which topic?</p>
<p>Which you mean for drones?</p>
<p>Just space travel technology.</p>
<p>Because if you look at where we&rsquo;re going, because everyone talks about Mars, and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>okay, and we&rsquo;re, hey, are we going to be able to colonize?</p>
<p>And I know Elon is big into that.</p>
<p>Yeah, what do you think about Elon, SpaceX, NASA?</p>
<p>We put humans back up there.</p>
<p>My theory, so it&rsquo;s funny because I know one of the guys that was, he was one of the original</p>
<p>employees at SpaceX.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a friend of mine, and I won&rsquo;t say his name.</p>
<p>But he knows Elon.</p>
<p>And he actually worked on the entire Falcon 1 project.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the lead guys on that.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s got some great, as a matter of fact, there&rsquo;s a movie, there&rsquo;s a book coming out</p>
<p>that comes out in about a year on this.</p>
<p>The original, the first years of space, first six years of SpaceX.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s named in the book.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re supposed to make a movie on it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, hey, who&rsquo;s going to play it?</p>
<p>But what he&rsquo;s done, to me, it changed the game, and here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>Because I said, I think it was 62 when Eisenhower warned of the industrial defense complex.</p>
<p>Which it has become, everything he warned us of, it has become, and it&rsquo;s really driven</p>
<p>by, there&rsquo;s the big three in defense, which is really Northrop, Lockheed, and Boeing.</p>
<p>Those are the big, those are your biggest, and Raytheon&rsquo;s kind of right, like a subset</p>
<p>of that.</p>
<p>But Raytheon&rsquo;s pretty big too.</p>
<p>But in US defense, those are the big guys, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually where a lot of military guys go when they retire, they go do stuff like</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>And you look at that, and you go, and the way government contracting is working, and</p>
<p>how we charge, and why things cost so much.</p>
<p>And then you go, you got Elon, who&rsquo;s got an ego, and he doesn&rsquo;t like to do things a certain</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked to the guy that worked there on, because the government likes to have oversight</p>
<p>of contracts, where he was like, no, just tell me what you want, I&rsquo;ll build it, and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a bill when it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>And then if I do it for half the price, I make a ton of money, because he&rsquo;s a money</p>
<p>driven guy, which I like, capitalism at its best.</p>
<p>So now you look at the two things.</p>
<p>So you got the SpaceX, which is the Dragon capsule, right?</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got Boeing.</p>
<p>So Elon did what Boeing is contracted to do in less time for half the money.</p>
<p>And oh, by the way, because he can reuse the boosters, because they come back and land,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have to, like Morton Thicol, we&rsquo;ve reused them on the space shuttle.</p>
<p>But they had to take them all apart and do a bunch of stuff, because they landed in Saltwater,</p>
<p>and then he had to put them all back together.</p>
<p>Where Elon gets them down, because I was joking with this guy, go, what do they do?</p>
<p>Do they like rehaul, overhaul, because no, actually they clean them up, and they can</p>
<p>use them again.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re reusable systems.</p>
<p>Incredible leap in technology that no one thought of, but here&rsquo;s a private company.</p>
<p>So being able to put people in the capsule and the spacesuits, I mean, it&rsquo;s literally</p>
<p>like sci fi when you watch when they went up.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a huge fan of what he and his company have been able to do, because the fact that</p>
<p>we were paying huge amounts of money to the Russian government, and oh, by the way, if</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t know, because I have some friends that are astronauts, they all have to learn</p>
<p>Russian.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And they have to do, it&rsquo;s what, level five, where the test is a phone call, where they</p>
<p>call you up and they, because they would go, so I went to the pinning, two friends of mine.</p>
<p>The one actually had a mission date, the one got one later.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s cool when you&rsquo;re watching your friends doing a spacewalk, because I would pull up,</p>
<p>because if I knew what was going on, I&rsquo;d pull up the NASA thing.</p>
<p>I was in a meeting one day, and I&rsquo;ve got NASA on and makers out there floating around doing</p>
<p>his stuff.</p>
<p>And I saw one, he&rsquo;s in the space station while they&rsquo;re doing a spacewalk, so it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>cool when you go, oh yeah, I know that dude, he&rsquo;s up there in space, floating around.</p>
<p>So when you look at what those, they&rsquo;re capable of doing, and then you go, what Elon is bringing</p>
<p>to the fact that now it&rsquo;s back in America, it&rsquo;s actually, to me, it&rsquo;s cost effective</p>
<p>for us to be able to do more stuff.</p>
<p>I think it opens the door to, do we go back to the moon?</p>
<p>Is there a reason to go back to the moon?</p>
<p>Personally, I think if they&rsquo;re really going to go, in years from now, go to Mars, I think</p>
<p>that the moon is the stepping stone to go back, to start proving some of the technology,</p>
<p>to go, hey, we can build this, we can get on the moon, and now we can get back off the</p>
<p>moon.</p>
<p>Because we did this on less than a compact computer in the 60s, which is the whole reason</p>
<p>that I flew, because I&rsquo;m obsessed.</p>
<p>Matter of fact, I have the giant Lego Apollo at home, and the Lander, and I have one that</p>
<p>my dad built me in 1969, right after that, and Neil Armstrong&rsquo;s an Ohio boy, and so</p>
<p>am I.</p>
<p>Matter of fact, I have a picture of him in a car in Wapakonet, Ohio, at the parade after</p>
<p>he walked on the moon, because his parents didn&rsquo;t live far from my aunt and uncle in</p>
<p>Wapakoneta, and they were out at the parade.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been obsessed with this since I was a child.</p>
<p>Do you hope to, do you think, do you hope that you&rsquo;ll go out to space one day?</p>
<p>Me?</p>
<p>If I had the opportunity, I&rsquo;d go in a second.</p>
<p>I am not.</p>
<p>Because, I mean, that&rsquo;s one of the hopes of the commercial space flight, is that, you</p>
<p>know, like people like, I mean, it would be tourism, but you certainly wouldn&rsquo;t want to,</p>
<p>in terms of, you&rsquo;re not kind of a civilian, right, I mean, in a sense that you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>a normal person, you&rsquo;re not a 5G pilot currently, but it seems like if we send a civilian up,</p>
<p>there would be somebody like you in the next, like, 20 years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be, you know, if Elon wants to throw me on one of those things, I&rsquo;d be all over</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like, okay, but, you know, sometimes you gotta get your kicks while you&rsquo;re alive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear that discussion with your wife.</p>
<p>Listen, there&rsquo;s the pros and cons.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s, I mean, I&rsquo;ve known her since high school, so she, yeah, she knows how I am, you know.</p>
<p>Most people that know me are like, yeah, you&rsquo;re pretty much the same person you were in high</p>
<p>school.</p>
<p>You know, I was a class clown and I still am that way.</p>
<p>So let me ask you this question.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m talking to Elon again soon, I&rsquo;m curious to get your perspective on it.</p>
<p>If I wanted to talk to him about TICTAC, about these weird out there propulsion ideas, which</p>
<p>are obviously, just like you said, if there&rsquo;s something to it, if it can be investigated</p>
<p>somehow, it would be extremely useful for us to understand in the effort of developing</p>
<p>propulsion systems that can get us cheaply out to space.</p>
<p>What should Elon think about this stuff?</p>
<p>What should he do?</p>
<p>What should people like him do?</p>
<p>I think people need to open their aperture up and stay off of, take the next step and</p>
<p>go, you know, we are tied to fuels and either solid rocket or liquid or whatever we do,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a thrust generated where we rapidly expand gas to create thrust, which is really</p>
<p>in layman&rsquo;s terms, you know, we can get into what, but that&rsquo;s what it does.</p>
<p>If you have something that you can contain that is a fuel source that would last a significant</p>
<p>amount of time, you know, those rocket boosters go and when they&rsquo;re done, they&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s enough to get them back down and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a huge, you know, they&rsquo;re not coming back and go, oh, I still got three</p>
<p>quarters of a tank.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s bolt them on and do it again.</p>
<p>His system&rsquo;s not doing that.</p>
<p>But you know, the way contracting, especially in the government, the government has tons</p>
<p>of money, but you got to remember the government has to justify how they spend our tax dollars</p>
<p>for the most part.</p>
<p>There are times where they can hide money in the budget to get stuff done.</p>
<p>But then when you look at, and I&rsquo;m just going to throw a few out there, but if you look</p>
<p>at what Amazon, you know, does with Bezos and you&rsquo;ve got Elon, there&rsquo;s some big money</p>
<p>out there.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re talking, you know, Bezos alone could buy companies like big companies.</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s another one.</p>
<p>These companies had huge, huge amounts of money.</p>
<p>And then just go over to the Gates Foundation and they&rsquo;ve got gazillions and gazillions</p>
<p>of dollars.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got universities.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much money out there.</p>
<p>If we really wanted to do it, aside from what the government wants to do, because we do</p>
<p>live in a free society, I think there&rsquo;s enough to go, how do we do this?</p>
<p>And because when you work outside of what the government would want to do, let&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not working on this necessarily for the United States, although I am a huge giant.</p>
<p>I will be.</p>
<p>American.</p>
<p>I would never.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I am an American.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking to somebody born in the Soviet.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe you agreed to this.</p>
<p>But, but when I haven&rsquo;t killed me yet, you&rsquo;re here and you&rsquo;ve been here for a while.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m joking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an American citizen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually pretty much American.</p>
<p>But see, when you do that, so you look at, let&rsquo;s just look at American universities.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There are some brilliant minds and we&rsquo;ll just use MIT because you worked down there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some brilliant minds, but there&rsquo;s a huge chunk of those brilliant minds that</p>
<p>are not American citizens.</p>
<p>So if you want to get into government stuff and you are not an American citizen, it gets</p>
<p>really, really, really hard.</p>
<p>But if I take money like Bezos money, Elon money, and they, let&rsquo;s just say they want</p>
<p>to work together.</p>
<p>They can split it up 50, 50, the two of them when the technology gets developed.</p>
<p>But now I&rsquo;m not constrained by who has to do the work.</p>
<p>I just want to make sure that I try and keep it in the United States because technology</p>
<p>is technology.</p>
<p>And if it gets developed and gets over to where a country gets a hold of it and then</p>
<p>just basically uses it for their own, because you save them all the research time, you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to do that.</p>
<p>But if we can get to the point where we can, we do it on the International Space Station.</p>
<p>We realize that space was too expensive for one country to do alone.</p>
<p>So we made the International Space Station and we have a conglomerate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one thing that the Russians and the U.S. actually work together on.</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>We work together on space because we realize it&rsquo;s way too expensive for us to do alone</p>
<p>and effective.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got this thing that&rsquo;s been out there floating around for God, now what is it, like</p>
<p>20 years that thing&rsquo;s been up there floating around?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s getting old.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have to replace parts and do stuff.</p>
<p>But if we can pool the money together and come up with something that would literally</p>
<p>change mankind and change travel and allow us to actually do a more effective thing of</p>
<p>engineering, because if you develop that technology, you don&rsquo;t even have to send a man person.</p>
<p>If you can develop a technology that&rsquo;s so, and with our automation and where we&rsquo;re progressing</p>
<p>and our competing power to send something out that&rsquo;s not just floating around when,</p>
<p>you know, that can react a lot quicker, something that could actually go down to the surface</p>
<p>and come back up.</p>
<p>So right now, everything we get out of Mars, it goes down there and then it just sends</p>
<p>data back.</p>
<p>Get an analyzer.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;ve got a technology that can go up there really quick, I&rsquo;m not worried about</p>
<p>man.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have life support systems and all that.</p>
<p>But if it can go down, it can go, it can cruise around, it can hover above, it can take samples</p>
<p>and it can actually take Martian soil and then bring it back.</p>
<p>So we can analyze it here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a game changer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complete game changer because it opens up all the planets.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So in a sense, the Tic Tac is a symbol.</p>
<p>So whatever you think, even from a debunking perspective, there&rsquo;s a nonzero probability</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s alien technology.</p>
<p>In that sense, it serves as a beacon of hope and a reason to, like you said, widen the</p>
<p>aperture and to invest big amounts of money into thinking outside the box.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost a hope to say we can do better propulsion.</p>
<p>We can overcome physics in an order of magnitude better way and it&rsquo;s worthwhile to try.</p>
<p>I think, and I don&rsquo;t think the money, if you look at a big picture with the amount of money,</p>
<p>some that&rsquo;s out there floating around these private companies, I think if you said, hey,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got, let&rsquo;s just say a hundred million dollars, which really a hundred million dollars</p>
<p>relative to Bezos has got, what, a hundred and some billion dollars in that work.</p>
<p>So if he said, hey, a hundred million dollars, you drop a hundred million dollars and I go</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to put a, like the government will send a broad area announcement out that</p>
<p>says, hey, we&rsquo;re looking for this technology or a DARPA program.</p>
<p>But what if I just said, hey, who&rsquo;s to stop Bezos and Elon from doing that on their own</p>
<p>to say, hey, I want to go pool universities because they have fewer restrictions because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not tax dollars.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have the checks inbound.</p>
<p>They can do whatever they want.</p>
<p>So their money, sorry about that, to go, hey, I&rsquo;m going to put this out and I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to get the best physicists that are working at CERN, that are at MIT, that are at Caltech,</p>
<p>at the schools I mentioned.</p>
<p>And, oh, by the way, a few of these guys are propulsion experts and I&rsquo;m going to basically,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to fund you guys for 10 years.</p>
<p>So you get $10 million a year and I&rsquo;m going to give you your salaries and we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to do that or whatever the amount works.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s cut it down to five so we can pay you well, right?</p>
<p>To do the research.</p>
<p>But, oh, by the way, the research is, it&rsquo;s not classified, but it&rsquo;s controlled.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not going to publicly just put this out in journals, but if we make a leap that</p>
<p>we think would advance because although those, let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s 10 of them, those 10 scientists</p>
<p>come up with something and they put out a paper, there might be a number 11 at another</p>
<p>university that reads that paper and says, hey, I kind of had this idea and now you can</p>
<p>get a thought pool that pushes us in and gets us out of the mindset.</p>
<p>Because we have a tendency to, we evolve the stuff that we create, but it&rsquo;s like I was</p>
<p>joking because I know a ton of guys with PhDs and girls.</p>
<p>And I said, but how much, when a person gets a PhD in engineering, how much new math is</p>
<p>really being done?</p>
<p>I said, there&rsquo;s a handful of people in the world that are really doing, I&rsquo;m talking Stephen</p>
<p>Hawkins type brilliance that is going, I&rsquo;m really doing something that&rsquo;s totally different.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big dramatic thing now going on in physics that everybody&rsquo;s converged towards</p>
<p>this local minima or local maxima, whatever you think about it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s again, same as with the TICTAC, thinking outside the box is not accepted and it probably</p>
<p>should be.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s hard because if you go back, go back to Einstein, back to the original, he was</p>
<p>out of the box.</p>
<p>He did not think the norm.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true genius.</p>
<p>Had he not thought out of the box and came up with some of his theories, where would</p>
<p>we be?</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;re jumping around a little bit.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve talked a little bit about Elon and Mars and space, but let me jump back to a</p>
<p>few questions that folks had.</p>
<p>I have to kind of bring up some debunking stuff because I think not the actual facts</p>
<p>of the debunking, but the nature of the true believers versus the debunkers hurts my heart</p>
<p>a little bit because people are just talking past each other, but let me kind of bring</p>
<p>it up.</p>
<p>Mick West, I&rsquo;ve just recently started to pay attention just in preparing to talk to you</p>
<p>about this world.</p>
<p>And Mick West is one of the better known people who kind of makes a career out of trying to</p>
<p>debunk.</p>
<p>Sort of his natural approach to all situations is that of a skeptic.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very useful and powerful, especially for me coming from a scientific perspective</p>
<p>to take the approach he does.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s valuable.</p>
<p>And I think no matter what, I think there&rsquo;s, I hope that people, quote unquote, true believers</p>
<p>are a little bit more open minded to the work of Mick West.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s quite useful and brilliant work.</p>
<p>So let me ask, he has a bunch of videos, a bunch of ideas where he kind of suggests possible</p>
<p>other explanations of the things that were out there.</p>
<p>He has some explanations of the things that you&rsquo;ve seen in with the Tic Tac, like with</p>
<p>your own eyes.</p>
<p>He says that it&rsquo;s possible that you miscalculated the size and the distance of the thing and</p>
<p>so on when you were flying around.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t find that as, I mean, maybe you can comment on that.</p>
<p>Let me do it right now.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So, cause that comes up.</p>
<p>Like how, how did you know it was about 40 feet long?</p>
<p>I go, okay, so 16 years flying against other airplanes, know what stuff looks like.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve looked down on things.</p>
<p>So if I know, I know, here&rsquo;s the known things.</p>
<p>I know when we saw the Tic Tac, I was at 20,000 feet ish, right around there.</p>
<p>So when I look down, I know what a Hornet looks like looking down on them cause I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done it for all those years.</p>
<p>I mean, I got a good idea.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s why I said 40 feet cause it&rsquo;s about Hornet size.</p>
<p>So and as I go around, you know, you get to the point where you have to be able to judge</p>
<p>distance when we fly out of experience and you can tell if something small or big, you</p>
<p>know.</p>
<p>So I would argue the fact of, you know, peer experiences, you know, professional observers,</p>
<p>which is what we&rsquo;re actually trained to do.</p>
<p>And having done it for so long, no, it was, and everyone came back with the same thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, yeah, it&rsquo;s about size of Hornet.</p>
<p>From a human factors perspective, how often in your experience of those 16 years do you</p>
<p>find that eyes, what you see is the incorrect state of things.</p>
<p>So like how often do you make mistakes with vision?</p>
<p>You actually, you make vision issues a lot because you&rsquo;re, and the sad part is, is your</p>
<p>brain believes what your eyes see.</p>
<p>We are actually trained to do the opposite of that, especially when you instrument fly</p>
<p>because your brain and eyes can tell you one thing, but you got to trust your instruments.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to landing at night.</p>
<p>So your eyes assume that the runway and your brain assumes that</p>
<p>the runway is fixed, but you know that the runway is moving.</p>
<p>So if I try and do stuff visually, I would, you die every time, not every time, but you</p>
<p>die close to every time trying to land on a boat.</p>
<p>So we actually use instruments, which are counter to your brain.</p>
<p>So, and there&rsquo;s actually all kinds of things that we go through in training.</p>
<p>They have this thing, I think they still use it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the MSDD multi spatial disorientation device or the spin and puke.</p>
<p>It looks like a giant carousel and you&rsquo;re in these little modules.</p>
<p>And when you get out, you think the thing goes really fast and they can, you can make</p>
<p>yourself think that I&rsquo;m descending or climbing, but we were actually only going around in</p>
<p>circles at a very slow rate, as fast as a human can talk.</p>
<p>But as they spin you around in a little sub thing and slow it down and speed it up, your</p>
<p>body does this and you, you know, and then by visuals of showing you like they can spin</p>
<p>it sideways to the outside wall, but they can show like lines that are, they can make</p>
<p>the line stand still because they&rsquo;re moving the same velocity.</p>
<p>They can move the other way and you&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;re screaming.</p>
<p>You see it in amusement parks all the time.</p>
<p>You do all that because it gives you a sense of the A, but you&rsquo;re really not doing, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sitting there.</p>
<p>So we get trained on all that stuff.</p>
<p>So if you, if you want to look at it and go, well, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re disoriented or this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like, I&rsquo;d argue going, no, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>Because you know, when I&rsquo;m flying the airplane, even as I&rsquo;m looking at the Tic Tac, I&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>a heads up display that tells me what my airplane&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve got, I know what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>I can look outside.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a sense of what I&rsquo;m doing, but I&rsquo;m also looking inside to cross check of what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing is in reality, what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>You actually, your brain gotten good at combining almost adding extra sensory information.</p>
<p>You have to, you have like supervision, so you&rsquo;re combining what you&rsquo;re seeing and adjusting</p>
<p>what the sensors, what you call an instruments are giving you.</p>
<p>And that, that in turn is a loop that adjusts the perception system that like, that, that</p>
<p>adjusts your brain&rsquo;s interpretation of what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be amazed at how good, so here&rsquo;s a, here&rsquo;s another example.</p>
<p>So if we go out over the water, so there&rsquo;s no land in sight and we&rsquo;re going to fight.</p>
<p>So when we fight, you know, two airplanes, we&rsquo;re going to dog fight.</p>
<p>As an instructor and I was for all, most of my time, you have to come back and you have</p>
<p>to recreate it.</p>
<p>So we call it drawing arrows.</p>
<p>So you have to recreate that stuff.</p>
<p>So you get pretty good at going, you know, like I would take off and say, all right,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re starting heading due east and I know where the sun is at because in the short couple</p>
<p>minutes that we&rsquo;re going to fight, the sun&rsquo;s really not going to move much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be in a relative zone.</p>
<p>I know that the sun is at, you know, let&rsquo;s just say 195 degrees, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m starting going east and it&rsquo;s actually be down off my right hand side.</p>
<p>So now I know as I&rsquo;m fighting, cause in the water you don&rsquo;t have any reference.</p>
<p>Like I pass land.</p>
<p>I pass land.</p>
<p>No, you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t use clouds cause clouds do move.</p>
<p>But you got to come back cause you go, here&rsquo;s where I started.</p>
<p>And then you, when, as soon as you end, you go, all right, I ended heading 355.</p>
<p>And then you recreate the turns and the amount of turns and use the sun relative.</p>
<p>So you can create this entire battle that went on with arrows so that you can come back</p>
<p>and debrief the guy that you were teaching on exactly what happened.</p>
<p>And you get really, really good at that.</p>
<p>So when you come up and go, well, Dave, how do you know you were at six oclock?</p>
<p>And he went around and he came up here.</p>
<p>I go, because I&rsquo;m trained to do all that.</p>
<p>And I take all the notes, why I&rsquo;m flying, you can do it.</p>
<p>But usually it&rsquo;s, you memorize it all and you get done and then you, as soon as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>done, you knock it off, you look at the other airplane, you get set and you start writing</p>
<p>all your notes down.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re writing it really fast on your card and you go out with a stack of cards</p>
<p>and you stick the new one on your knee board card so you&rsquo;re ready to go and here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>next setup.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of, it&rsquo;s in some way similar to what like at the, at the highest level chess</p>
<p>players do.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re, I mean, they, they, they recap the games.</p>
<p>But the, the richness of the representation that they use in remembering like how the</p>
<p>games evolved.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s much richer than the actual moves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like these, a bunch of patterns that are hard to put into words, like, like all</p>
<p>the richness of thinking they have about the way the game evolved.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like instinctual from years and years of experience.</p>
<p>So they try to put it into words, but they really can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just.</p>
<p>I understand that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because for us, if we don&rsquo;t come back with anything, then there&rsquo;s no learning to</p>
<p>be had.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because the whole thing is the debrief when we get back and we talk about, that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>where the learning is.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same thing if you want to go back to chess, you know, when you start off,</p>
<p>you try and learn because you&rsquo;re remembering what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>If you play against someone, I&rsquo;m always a big place, play with someone better than you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you learn.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re constantly beating people, you&rsquo;re not learning anything.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just learning that they&rsquo;re not good and you&rsquo;re better.</p>
<p>When you challenge yourself against someone that is better than you, you learn.</p>
<p>So I learned how to fight an airplane with, he&rsquo;s actually one of my best friends, we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>call him Tom.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t give his call sign because I don&rsquo;t know what his name is.</p>
<p>So Tom took me out and taught me how to fight because Tom had just left Top Gun.</p>
<p>He was the training officer at Top Gun, which so that&rsquo;s the guy, the training officer is</p>
<p>the main guy at Top Gun.</p>
<p>So Tom was the training officer at Top Gun.</p>
<p>So Tom, when I learned, because I had come out of A6 and we really don&rsquo;t fight because</p>
<p>it was a bomber.</p>
<p>So I get in F18s and I want to learn how to fight because it&rsquo;s a whole other side of the</p>
<p>mission.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the F and F fighter attack.</p>
<p>The F18 is fighter attack.</p>
<p>So I had to learn how to fight.</p>
<p>So now I got one of the best fighter pilots in the world who&rsquo;s going to teach me how to</p>
<p>do it.</p>
<p>And he did.</p>
<p>And I would do something and then he would go, I&rsquo;d get to a situation where I had never</p>
<p>been.</p>
<p>And then I would go, well, I&rsquo;m going to do this.</p>
<p>And then he would destroy me and he would come back and go, here&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>And then I would take that knowledge and I would put it in my little basket of tricks.</p>
<p>And over time, because you don&rsquo;t, no one walks out into that world.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care how gifted of an aviator and go, I am the man or the woman.</p>
<p>I am it.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a learning process.</p>
<p>And so over all those years, you&rsquo;ve gotten good.</p>
<p>So what are the chances that your eyes betrays you when you saw the Tic Tac?</p>
<p>Low.</p>
<p>Zero.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I&rsquo;m not zero.</p>
<p>So maybe 90.</p>
<p>Yeah, I am ninety nine point nine percent.</p>
<p>So point one percent.</p>
<p>My eyes deceive me.</p>
<p>But remember, if it deceived me, it had to deceive the other four people.</p>
<p>So the percentage is even lower.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Look up.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t find that particular debunking case that you said, but I&rsquo;m glad you put it.</p>
<p>You you said those words out loud.</p>
<p>So for me, from my perspective, coming into this world and looking at it, I&rsquo;m a little</p>
<p>bit more skeptical.</p>
<p>So your eye account, I think, is the most fascinating story.</p>
<p>And that I think that&rsquo;s inspiring to me and should be inspiring to a lot of scientists</p>
<p>out there on so many levels, just like we said, an engineering level that maybe there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>propulsion systems we can actually build that can do some crazy, amazing stuff.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s at the very least intriguing and at the best inspiring.</p>
<p>I just want to say that.</p>
<p>But on the video side, it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s the videos for the Flir video, the go fast and</p>
<p>the gimbal video.</p>
<p>They are only interesting to me to me in the context of your story.</p>
<p>Like without that, they&rsquo;re kind of low resolution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it it&rsquo;s easier to build a debunking story to be skeptical.</p>
<p>So this is where I&rsquo;m coming from.</p>
<p>Maybe you can convince me otherwise.</p>
<p>But so to bring up Mick West one more time, he looks at the Flir video and he says that</p>
<p>one of the most amazing video parts of the Flir video for people haven&rsquo;t seen it is at</p>
<p>the end of it, the Tic Tac flies or appears to fly very quickly to the left off the screen.</p>
<p>And what Mick West says is that, you know, Mick West, probably others, that the way to</p>
<p>explain that is the tracking system.</p>
<p>Like we said, this vision based tracking simply loses the like the object.</p>
<p>The tracking loses it.</p>
<p>And so it simply allows the object to float off screen because it&rsquo;s no longer tracking</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>So I find that at least a plausible explanation of that video.</p>
<p>Looking at your face, you do not.</p>
<p>So can you maybe comment to that to that debunking aspect?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s funny how people can extrapolate stuff who&rsquo;ve never operated the system.</p>
<p>No, for sure.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like me going because I&rsquo;m a big Formula One fan.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s like me going, oh, my God, Lewis, what were you doing?</p>
<p>You could have done this with the car and you&rsquo;d have won the race.</p>
<p>You know, and Lewis Hamilton right now is, you know, defending world champion two time</p>
<p>ways, four time, four or five time world champion.</p>
<p>But that would be pretty stupid of me to try and tell Lewis Hamilton how to drive a car.</p>
<p>Or a matter of fact, anyone driving a Formula One car.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve watched.</p>
<p>You got to remember when we looked at this thing, when when Chad came back with the video,</p>
<p>we sat there and watched that.</p>
<p>I mean, I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I watched it off the original tapes going, all</p>
<p>right, right.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at this, you know, because you can look and see where the you can see where</p>
<p>the airplane&rsquo;s going.</p>
<p>You can see if it&rsquo;s looking left or right.</p>
<p>And if you actually watch all that stuff, it doesn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>It actually when the vehicle starts to move, the bars, the tracking gate starts to open</p>
<p>up and the people at Raytheon could probably add to this because they built the pod.</p>
<p>The tracking gate will start to open up.</p>
<p>And but the thing when it leaves so fast off the screen, the pod can&rsquo;t move fast enough.</p>
<p>It has gimbal rates on how fast that thing can move around because there&rsquo;s another theory</p>
<p>that, oh, the pods looking forward when the pod passes underneath the airplane.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m looking at you and you pass underneath me as it does this, the ball will actually</p>
<p>flip around to kind of finish off and it&rsquo;ll it&rsquo;ll it swaps ends because it has, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a gimbal.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t just it&rsquo;s not free floating.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a theory on one of them.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s here and it flipped over.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t do that when it&rsquo;s looking out in front.</p>
<p>It stays like this.</p>
<p>So yet another another debunker who doesn&rsquo;t know this.</p>
<p>So, you know, and Mick has had several theories on other of some of the other videos like</p>
<p>one of them, the go fast as a bird.</p>
<p>And Jeremy Corbell actually did a nice job of saying, no, it&rsquo;s not because he&rsquo;s on he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>on black hot.</p>
<p>So the white object is actually colder than the ocean.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>If they were colder than the ocean, they&rsquo;d be dead.</p>
<p>So the gimbal video to comment on the amazing aspect of that video is the rotation, the</p>
<p>apparent rotation of the object.</p>
<p>That is something that is not possible to do with systems that we know of.</p>
<p>And Mick West suggests that a flare like reflections or whatever can explain.</p>
<p>Now, because what Mick West doesn&rsquo;t see is so when they take because I&rsquo;ve talked to the</p>
<p>one of them, actually, I work with.</p>
<p>So I know him.</p>
<p>I know I talk to him all the time.</p>
<p>So and it&rsquo;s his best friend actually shot the video, one of his best friends for the</p>
<p>video, the movie and both of them that go fast in the game were shot by the same person.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>OK, so and they were in each other&rsquo;s wedding.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how well they know each other.</p>
<p>OK, so what you don&rsquo;t see is.</p>
<p>So the airplanes, airplanes still super hornets, but they have the APG 79, which is the new</p>
<p>phased array radar that&rsquo;s made by Raytheon, things incredible, OK?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t usually if it&rsquo;s if it&rsquo;s out there and it sees it, it&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>So at first they thought they were ghost tracks when they started seeing stuff.</p>
<p>And then they actually threw one of the targeting pods out there.</p>
<p>Well, the targeting pod, there&rsquo;s heat signature and you go, hey, dot heat signature, something&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not you&rsquo;re not picking up some extraneous thing.</p>
<p>So what you see in the gimbal video of the thing and it rotates and you go, holy shit,</p>
<p>look at that thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s in the wind and it&rsquo;s going against the wind while it&rsquo;s doing this.</p>
<p>You know, someone goes, oh, it&rsquo;s an airplane.</p>
<p>No, if an airplane does this, it&rsquo;s eventually going to start to change aspect because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in a turn.</p>
<p>This thing doesn&rsquo;t change aspect.</p>
<p>It just rotates.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just rotating.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>The other thing that you see when you talk to them is so they&rsquo;re on their radar.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an object that they identify is their number one priority or their launch and steering.</p>
<p>So when they designate that, that&rsquo;s where the targeting pod is going to look.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you get on the gimbal video.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s five other I think it&rsquo;s five.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kind of in a V, you know, like a geese would fly that are out in front of it and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually coming.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re out in front of it and they actually turn on the radar and go the other way while</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re filming the gimbal video, which it&rsquo;s I know Ryan has come out and talked about</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>But when you see it, you go, you know, if you take it in context because you go, oh,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the video.</p>
<p>Well, if you take the video with the radar going, no, there&rsquo;s actually other things out</p>
<p>there because there&rsquo;s at least 60 people that have seen these things on radar off the VACAPES.</p>
<p>It actually became, I called a buddy of mine who was running the wing at the time, the</p>
<p>fighter wing.</p>
<p>I said, dude, what are you guys doing about this?</p>
<p>He goes, well, we got a NOTAM out, which is a notice to airmen, which means there&rsquo;s these</p>
<p>objects out there in the warning area.</p>
<p>So anyone, you can fly a Cessna through the warning area.</p>
<p>All the warning area tells you is that there&rsquo;s high military traffic and training out here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably best not to be here, but there&rsquo;s nothing that prohibits you from going in there.</p>
<p>So these things have the right, wherever they&rsquo;re from or whatever they are, you know, cause</p>
<p>people are like, oh, they&rsquo;re balloons.</p>
<p>Well, balloons float.</p>
<p>Balloons don&rsquo;t sit in 70 knots of wind and stay in the same location.</p>
<p>They had an airplane because there was two.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the gimbal thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty big object.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also, they talk about, it looks like a cube that&rsquo;s inside of a sphere.</p>
<p>A translucent sphere.</p>
<p>What the hell is that?</p>
<p>And they almost hit one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost hit them.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another, that&rsquo;s one of the biggest, another biggest account.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like almost hit a plane, something that appeared to be a cube in a translucent sphere.</p>
<p>What do you make of that?</p>
<p>Again, you know, what, I mean, that that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the most dangerous thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>The biggest frustration is when you do that and you go, okay, so this thing passed between</p>
<p>two airplanes and it was, I think it was more than like a hundred feet or something like</p>
<p>that of the airplane that almost hit it.</p>
<p>So what they do is they come back and go, Hey, I had a near midair, what&rsquo;d you have</p>
<p>a near midair with?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of this floating beach ball with this cube inside of it.</p>
<p>And you go, huh?</p>
<p>And you know, so they send out a NOTAM again and they, they do a, what&rsquo;s called a hazard</p>
<p>report that says, Hey, there&rsquo;s these objects out there.</p>
<p>We almost hit one here and that gets sent off to the Naval safety center.</p>
<p>What was done?</p>
<p>I mean, what are you going to do?</p>
<p>Can you catch one, go out with a giant net and try and bag one?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know because they&rsquo;ve seen them.</p>
<p>They picked them up like hovering on radar.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden they&rsquo;re traveling at really high rates of speed.</p>
<p>So you know, what are you going to do?</p>
<p>Well, and that, let me ask this, cause this is what people kind of think about.</p>
<p>After you witnessed Tic Tac and after this, these incidents, as far as we know, uh, with</p>
<p>the gimbal and the go fast, it seems like people in the military did not, did not react</p>
<p>like what, like did not freak out.</p>
<p>It almost like was like a mundane event.</p>
<p>How do you explain that?</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t the people on the ship, not the higher ups, why wasn&rsquo;t there a big freakout?</p>
<p>Or as some people suggest, the higher ups knew about it all along and just were not</p>
<p>letting everyone know that there&rsquo;s some kind of secret military, uh, uh, you know, like,</p>
<p>like tests.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about, so let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve got this cool new toy, which you call it a cool</p>
<p>new toy.</p>
<p>You typically don&rsquo;t take your cool new toy out into an area where the cool new toy could</p>
<p>get damaged or what if the airplane would have actually hit your cool new toy and you</p>
<p>got two people that are ejecting or dead and you got a, you know, $80 million airplane</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s now in the bottom of the Atlantic, um, you know, tests are normally done in controlled</p>
<p>environments.</p>
<p>Just, it&rsquo;s like any test, a lab test or whatever.</p>
<p>When you take things out into the real world, you know, you&rsquo;re still going to test it in</p>
<p>an area where if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>So when they started and we&rsquo;ll go back to Elon.</p>
<p>So my friend that worked there, they had a rocket go off, they were out in Kwajalein</p>
<p>and when the rocket went up, a fuel line ruptured in the rocket and it ran out of fuel before</p>
<p>it got all the way up and it came falling back down.</p>
<p>Well, when you&rsquo;re out on an ATOL in the Pacific, if it&rsquo;s going up above you, the worst case</p>
<p>is going to land on you.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re worried about where else is it going to land and it actually crashed next to the</p>
<p>ATOL and, and, you know, Elon wasn&rsquo;t happy and threw this guy under the bus.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a test environment because you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>So cause someone said, well, when we chased the Tic Tac, well, it could have been some</p>
<p>secret government thing.</p>
<p>Well, secret government things typically just don&rsquo;t come out and test to where there&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be.</p>
<p>Unknowing pilots, you can&rsquo;t control a lot of things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re exactly right.</p>
<p>So you go, you know, it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s not the Dr. Evil scientist that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>throw shit out there to get, there&rsquo;s control and there&rsquo;s reasons that we do it because</p>
<p>a lot of stuff, especially when you get to there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s, you build something in theory,</p>
<p>you model it, you go, Hey, this is, it looks like it&rsquo;s going to work.</p>
<p>You get funding, you build it, you test it some more, you bench test it.</p>
<p>You know, you like an airplane with digital flight controls before it even leaves the</p>
<p>ground.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got things over the pedostatic system that are changing the, what the airplane thinks</p>
<p>is the airspeed talking to it and it&rsquo;s probably up on Jack.</p>
<p>So the gear up, so it doesn&rsquo;t, it thinks it&rsquo;s flying.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s sitting on Jack stands.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just changing the pressure on the pedostatic system so they can actually</p>
<p>make the flight controls move and they can get all the data back to go, Hey, it looks</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s going to work.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s wind, there&rsquo;s a bunch of stuff that they do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a control environment which you can do the testing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Throwing shit out in the middle of where people are doing exercises is the most preposterous</p>
<p>thing that I&rsquo;ve heard.</p>
<p>Is it possible?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is it more really, is it, is it, is it, is it more likely, it&rsquo;s more likely they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>doing that.</p>
<p>Then the other side of that question is why do you think people on the Nimitz and in the</p>
<p>US government in general, not freak out more at the incredible thing that you&rsquo;ve seen?</p>
<p>Freak out in the positive way, freak out in the negative way.</p>
<p>Like what are the Russians up to again?</p>
<p>Or more like what is this?</p>
<p>Like more turmoil.</p>
<p>So if you would have put a Chinese flag on the side of it or a Russian flag on the side</p>
<p>of it, and I said, yeah, it had a big Russian flag on the side of it, dude.</p>
<p>Then it would have got a lot of attention.</p>
<p>It would have went high order, right?</p>
<p>If it was, you don&rsquo;t have to say Russia or China, just say if there was another country&rsquo;s</p>
<p>emblem on the side of this thing that we saw and said, oh, it belonged to them, then it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a big deal.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re literally in the middle of workups and it was a joint workup.</p>
<p>Normally they, we go out for a month, go come back, do stuff, go out for a month.</p>
<p>This was a two month at sea period where we actually had to beg for them to let us when</p>
<p>the ship pulled in at Thanksgiving so we could run home up to the central valley, have Thanksgiving</p>
<p>with our family, and then run back down and do this, okay?</p>
<p>So when I had just taken over, I had had the squadron for a month, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a brand new CO, I&rsquo;m the most junior guy on the, as far as a commanding officer</p>
<p>goes, for time in the Navy, and actually at the time I think it was the most junior CO</p>
<p>for O5 Command in the Navy, right?</p>
<p>So you go, okay, so I&rsquo;m out here, I got my squadron, I&rsquo;m running it, I see this thing,</p>
<p>we catch shit for it.</p>
<p>I have a squadron to run.</p>
<p>I have the, the TICTAC was over here and although an extraordinary event, I have 17 aircrew</p>
<p>and 300 sailors that I&rsquo;m responsible for, right?</p>
<p>Their wellbeing, making sure they&rsquo;re fed, making sure they&rsquo;re happy, they&rsquo;re birthing,</p>
<p>you know, and I&rsquo;m working with my Master Chief and I&rsquo;m working with my XO, SNAP, and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going through all this stuff.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a lot of time to worry about the TICTAC.</p>
<p>But people need to talk to me, so you got to remember, you got the captain of the ship,</p>
<p>you got the air wing commander, and you got the Admiral.</p>
<p>Those are the top three.</p>
<p>And you got the CO of the Princeton, who is a major command guy, and that&rsquo;s really your</p>
<p>big major command.</p>
<p>And then everything else is you got all the squadrons, which are O5 Command, and you got</p>
<p>the small boys that are out there, which is O5 Command.</p>
<p>So in the hierarchy, as far as rank and responsibility of what&rsquo;s going on, I&rsquo;m pretty much in the</p>
<p>top 20 with all my peers, and then I&rsquo;ve got, obviously, the captain and the admiral, right?</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;s got some post command guys on his staff that we were friends with.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re responsible for a lot of things.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Busy schedule.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s missions.</p>
<p>You have to do a lot, get the job done, and there&rsquo;s no time for silly things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>So, and we&rsquo;re the integration, you know, when a battle group deploys, especially when you</p>
<p>go to the Middle East for what we were doing, the air power is the key.</p>
<p>We take our airport with us, we can park it anywhere we want, and we can do what we need</p>
<p>to do.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re kind of key players.</p>
<p>So when you get the theory that, oh, all these men in suits showed up.</p>
<p>So the captain of the ship never said anything to me, the admiral never saying to me, the</p>
<p>people on his staff that I was friends with never saying to me, the other COs that I talked</p>
<p>to on a daily basis never said anything to me, and no one ever came and talked to me,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m the guy that chased it.</p>
<p>So in all the theories and all the debunkers and all the stories, because I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if people think they&rsquo;re going to get rich on this because I made a big donut on this.</p>
<p>I can tell you what I got paid for.</p>
<p>I got paid to go out and spend 21 hours of my day going to LA and do a five minute talk</p>
<p>for someone.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, and it wasn&rsquo;t for the talk because I&rsquo;ll talk for free because you&rsquo;re not paying</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>I said, and then I got paid to go to the McMinnville Fest because my wife and I got to go because</p>
<p>it was just looked like fun because the whole town gets involved.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the only time I&rsquo;ve ever spoken publicly in front of a large audience about this because</p>
<p>it was just, you know, it was fun.</p>
<p>And I got asked and Jeremy and George Knappen went the year before.</p>
<p>So I went with Bob Lazar.</p>
<p>So I got to hang out with Bob and his wife and his wife and my wife and, you know, we</p>
<p>all hung out kind of, you know, talking not about UFO stuff, but just getting to know</p>
<p>each other as people because, you know, Bob&rsquo;s like me, the stuff that he talks about is</p>
<p>not the center of his life.</p>
<p>If anything, it ruined his life, you know, he&rsquo;s just a really, really smart guy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just like the rest of us trying to get through life.</p>
<p>Yeah, nevertheless, I mean, that was one of the sad things reading Lou Elizondo&rsquo;s resignation</p>
<p>note from his, he was a program director at the ATIP program.</p>
<p>One of the sad things is that he&rsquo;s mentioned that, you know, people in government just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t take this seriously as a threat, like UFOs as a threat, like you said, if it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a Russian label on it, it&rsquo;s a sad thing to think about that, that we have such a busy</p>
<p>schedule that the anomaly, it doesn&rsquo;t, is a distraction that we don&rsquo;t want to deal with</p>
<p>and it kind of just fades into history.</p>
<p>Like literally, it&rsquo;s kind of sad to think that if aliens showed up, like, and it just</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t because they&rsquo;re not, like when aliens show up, they&rsquo;re not going to be a thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>on the schedule and if they don&rsquo;t start killing people, they just kind of show up in some</p>
<p>very nonchalant peaceful way briefly.</p>
<p>People would be like, that&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t have time for this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so sad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>So, you know, go back, let&rsquo;s go back way back, way back in the time machine, you know, there</p>
<p>were people kind of scattered around the globe, you know, and Europe&rsquo;s a perfect example.</p>
<p>Why does France speak French?</p>
<p>And then right next to them, Spanish, you know, Spain speaks Spanish and then you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>kind of jump over and Germans are German and the Polish people, everyone speaks a different</p>
<p>language because if you look at the way the train kind of subdivide the original people</p>
<p>that were there, you know, thousands of years ago, they speak differently, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be like the US, but see, the US is different.</p>
<p>We all speak English because what happened?</p>
<p>We came over and we started on the east coast and we migrated west.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t get into the, you know, what happened and, you know, because the Native Americans</p>
<p>all spoke different languages, you know, it&rsquo;s that same type of thing.</p>
<p>So, but anytime we have a tendency to show up, you&rsquo;re actually, you think about, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>an alien.</p>
<p>If I went to a different area, if I just, you know, go back 500 years where, you know,</p>
<p>or a thousand years where travel, we weren&rsquo;t traveling across oceans at the time.</p>
<p>We were, well, we don&rsquo;t think we were, but the Vikings probably were because we had limited,</p>
<p>you know, we had to have supplies and the boats weren&rsquo;t as big.</p>
<p>We had to build them by hand.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have power tools and all that stuff.</p>
<p>So, you know, if you show up someplace like when the conquistadors from Spain came over</p>
<p>into South America and you&rsquo;ve got, you know, the natives, you&rsquo;re actually an alien, you</p>
<p>know, and then you look at what typically happens when aliens show up in a human alien</p>
<p>world, you know, and when I say alien, I mean, you are not from that area.</p>
<p>The other, we take what we want.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what happened.</p>
<p>I mean, we literally defuncted civilizations because that&rsquo;s how we are, you know, humans</p>
<p>are, we&rsquo;re an interesting group.</p>
<p>So you go, now what?</p>
<p>What if something is from someplace else?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just, let&rsquo;s just go off the grid and go, let&rsquo;s say there are little green men.</p>
<p>What are their intentions?</p>
<p>Lou asked me this when we were talking to Lou Elizondo and he said, what do you think</p>
<p>they were here for us?</p>
<p>I said, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>He goes, what?</p>
<p>I go, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>They were observing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d come down, they&rsquo;d hang out.</p>
<p>And he goes, well, what if they were prepping the battlefield?</p>
<p>What if they were observing to figure out what we do?</p>
<p>And you go, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>The other theory is maybe there&rsquo;s a more advanced civilization out here and they just check</p>
<p>in on us because the threat to an advanced civilization is when a civilization that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>inferior to them actually develops enough and fast enough to become equal or above.</p>
<p>Because now these, they become the threatened type.</p>
<p>So you watch us grow until we start getting too much.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s kind of like you go, well, cause they always have a tendency to hang</p>
<p>out around nuclear.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And you go, well, you know, if this is an advanced civilization, I&rsquo;m going to go science</p>
<p>fiction kind of comical.</p>
<p>They come down and watch us and go, look at the, the crazy upright monkeys now have developed</p>
<p>the atom bomb.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope they don&rsquo;t destroy themselves.</p>
<p>Yeah, if I was an alien civilization, I would start paying attention with the atom bomb.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the, I mean, there&rsquo;s certainly an uptick of, what is it, UFO sightings since,</p>
<p>since the nuclear era, since the nuclear era.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You go, hmm.</p>
<p>Let me ask a little bit out there question, maybe it&rsquo;s a speculation, but maybe touching</p>
<p>on Roswell, do you think it&rsquo;s possible that there is out of this world aircraft or beings</p>
<p>that are in the possession of one of the governments on this earth, like the US government?</p>
<p>Is it possible?</p>
<p>So the one perspective of that, if it&rsquo;s possible, is it possible to keep a secret like that?</p>
<p>I would say this.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very, it&rsquo;s highly possible because if you go, if you just look at all the sightings</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s go, just look at project Blue Book, it was what the, I forget how many thousands</p>
<p>of sightings that there&rsquo;s a percentage, it&rsquo;s like 10 or 15% of them, they still can&rsquo;t explain.</p>
<p>Like our Tic Tac is one of them that, you know, they basically, the government has come</p>
<p>out and said, we don&rsquo;t know what that was.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, so if you go, okay, of that 15% that we don&rsquo;t know, and all of these thousands are</p>
<p>still that 15% makes up a pretty big number.</p>
<p>What are the chances that not one of them crashed somewhere on the globe and was recovered?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s an intact system or you&rsquo;ve got pieces of it, of a metal that</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t explain or some, some biological matter to say the least, it could be intact</p>
<p>or it couldn&rsquo;t, but the odds of that now are starting to go down that, you know, that could</p>
<p>never happen.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not talking just the United States, I&rsquo;m talking the world.</p>
<p>So is there a chance that a foreign government actually possesses or our government or someone</p>
<p>in the, in the world on the globe of the seven plus billion people has something that is</p>
<p>not from this world?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not talking a meteor, but something that was manufactured in some way that allowed</p>
<p>transport or observation.</p>
<p>Could be a drone, could be a foreign drone, you know, like Voyager flies around and does</p>
<p>all that stuff.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got stuff that just went past Pluto that&rsquo;s out in the Kuiper belt, you know, there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s stuff out there floating around.</p>
<p>And what about ours, it&rsquo;s going to crash into Jupiter eventually or whatever, cause we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had stuff crash into planets.</p>
<p>So if that&rsquo;s the case, you would think something is out there that we have something that we</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t explain.</p>
<p>And according to Lou, there&rsquo;s stuff that we can&rsquo;t explain, you know, and I would assume</p>
<p>that Lou who ran a tip has, has seen stuff that he can&rsquo;t openly talk about because, you</p>
<p>know, cause I had a clearance.</p>
<p>When you have a clearance, you were, you sign your name, you&rsquo;re bound to that.</p>
<p>And to me, that&rsquo;s an important oath that you hold to, you know, and this is kind of where,</p>
<p>you know, people have issues with Bob.</p>
<p>So if, you know, and I leave it to you to determine if you believe Bob or not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you, Bob is a straightforward, very sane, normal, super smart guy.</p>
<p>Bob Luzaro.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There is the other side that says, well, should he have come out and talked, you know, to</p>
<p>those who will clearance who, you know, are true to the government, you would say he should</p>
<p>have never spoke.</p>
<p>He, he was under an oath to not say anything, but he did.</p>
<p>If you ask Bob, why did you say something?</p>
<p>His, his answer was, I understand there&rsquo;s an oath, but I felt that the technology could</p>
<p>benefit all of mankind and it shouldn&rsquo;t be locked away.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll leave it.</p>
<p>If you believe Bob, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s kind of what Bob says.</p>
<p>And that, that&rsquo;s such a interesting key point.</p>
<p>If there is aircraft, a technology that&rsquo;s in the possession of the, say the US government,</p>
<p>should they make that publicly known?</p>
<p>This is the question of like, do we release stuff that can potentially change the nature</p>
<p>of human civilization?</p>
<p>Like the, the way we, the way we think about our place in the world, also the, if that</p>
<p>technology is potentially useful for military applications, the nature of military conflict,</p>
<p>should we release that information or not, if you were the government?</p>
<p>So here, well, here&rsquo;s exactly how.</p>
<p>So for, for classified information, the government is the people that classify it.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t go, I can&rsquo;t look at something and go, Oh my God, this Avion bottle is now a</p>
<p>top secret.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t have the authority, the ability or anyone to do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the guard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s up to the government.</p>
<p>And I agree with that because I worked for the government for 24 years of my life.</p>
<p>So I understand that.</p>
<p>But now you go, there&rsquo;s reasons stuff is classified.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And it has to do with, uh, sometimes information is classified by how it was obtained.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like the mob.</p>
<p>If I have a spy and I&rsquo;m a mobster and you&rsquo;re the counter mobster, but I have a guy on the</p>
<p>inside that&rsquo;s feeding me information, I can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And a perfect example is if you&rsquo;ve ever seen the, uh, it&rsquo;s the Tom Cruise movie, what is</p>
<p>it?</p>
<p>Air America or whatever, but he, he plays the guy in Louisiana who was hauling drugs</p>
<p>for Pablo Escobar and he ended up getting a cargo plane and the government, the CIA</p>
<p>was kind of funding him to do stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how he got hooked up with Pablo, but they put cameras on his airplane and when</p>
<p>Reagan had come out and said, here&rsquo;s pictures, we have proof that they&rsquo;re running these drugs.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take Pablo long to figure out those pictures were taken from inside of the plane</p>
<p>of this guy he had been working with and that guy ends up dead.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>So you classify to protect the source, you classify to protect the technology because</p>
<p>if the technology would get out, it could be grave damage or there&rsquo;s levels depending</p>
<p>on if it&rsquo;s a secret or top secret.</p>
<p>There are levels of damage that can be done to the U S government and our wellbeing as</p>
<p>a country.</p>
<p>And we owe it to this because we&rsquo;re all Americans.</p>
<p>You know, to me, no matter what some people will say, even in this country, this is the</p>
<p>greatest country on the planet.</p>
<p>This is the only country that you have the ability to do what you want to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, don&rsquo;t be lazy.</p>
<p>And I have stories of people that came over here and started with nothing and they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re living the American dream and they&rsquo;ll tell you, and they didn&rsquo;t get it because of,</p>
<p>you know, like you, you came over here from Russia, you get no minority status or anything</p>
<p>else.</p>
<p>You get, you&rsquo;re a white Anglo Saxton Protestant, whatever your religion, but you come over</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>I kind of knew that from the last, but, um, but you come over here, you basically have</p>
<p>made yourself, you&rsquo;re educated, you&rsquo;re working at literally the top research university in</p>
<p>the world.</p>
<p>To be honest, um, I can do whatever the hell I can create a, with a bit of, with a lot</p>
<p>of hard work, I can do quite a, and no one gave it to you.</p>
<p>So, I mean, and I, well, I&rsquo;m a believer that like that, I mean, we are a community.</p>
<p>So like there is a social aspect to it, but the freedom and the American dream is a real</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>And this is this, I, you know, I joke about being Russian, but I, I&rsquo;m an American and</p>
<p>this is, I do believe the greatest country on earth.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a reason the nationalist pride, uh, the pride in your nation is a powerful</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>And around that, this secrecy holds value.</p>
<p>But to me, alien technology is bigger than that.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not so much a threat as a, you&rsquo;re holding back something that could</p>
<p>inspire the world, like human knowledge.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk in theory.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to go back to Bob cause I&rsquo;ve talked to Bob.</p>
<p>So Bob is a propulsion guy, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Bob has a bicycle with a rocket motor.</p>
<p>He built a rocket car, you know, so he did that.</p>
<p>So if you are trying to figure out a propulsion system, let&rsquo;s just say this is, I&rsquo;m just talking,</p>
<p>this is Dave&rsquo;s theory.</p>
<p>I am, I own, I have, I have custody of this thing from a technology that I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>And I know it&rsquo;s a propulsion system.</p>
<p>So now I got to figure it out, right?</p>
<p>So who are you going to go to, right?</p>
<p>You go find someone.</p>
<p>So you go, wait, here&rsquo;s a guy who at the time was working at Los Alamos, which they have</p>
<p>proven who is big into propulsion.</p>
<p>He designs all this.</p>
<p>He builds a shit in his garage, Hey, he&rsquo;s super smart.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we bring him in?</p>
<p>So you hire him on a contract and you go, Hey, we&rsquo;re going to brief you into a program.</p>
<p>And he goes and works on wherever he says he worked, you know, that&rsquo;s not important,</p>
<p>but you get access to the technology to try and figure it out.</p>
<p>And then you go, well, you know, Bob comes out and says, you know, like we&rsquo;re figuring</p>
<p>out these things, but there&rsquo;s a part where our technology isn&rsquo;t advanced enough for us</p>
<p>to figure the whole thing out.</p>
<p>So then, you know, and let&rsquo;s just say Bob doesn&rsquo;t come out and tell anyone he works</p>
<p>on it until he gets to the point where he&rsquo;s stagnated.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s at a, he&rsquo;s at a wall.</p>
<p>You go, I can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>You know, sometimes the best thing is to bring in a fresh mind.</p>
<p>So you go find someone else who&rsquo;s into propulsion, you bring him in and they work, they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>figure it out.</p>
<p>Or they get to the point where kind of back to the Einstein theory where, Hey, I&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>all these theories on how it works, but we don&rsquo;t have the technology.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t advanced enough to actually do what we need to do.</p>
<p>We still have to advance technology more.</p>
<p>So then what do you do?</p>
<p>You shelf it, you go, Hey, good projects over and the contract, you shelf it and you wait</p>
<p>another 10 years and you wait another 10 years until technology and our abilities and our</p>
<p>research advances more and then you go find new people to bring in that are experts in</p>
<p>that field and go, Hey, we want you to work on this thing and here&rsquo;s what we know about</p>
<p>it so far.</p>
<p>Or you don&rsquo;t tell them anything because you, cause remember if you, if you reveal someone</p>
<p>else&rsquo;s research, you can taint their beliefs.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll start to sway in that direction.</p>
<p>So you go, I&rsquo;m not going to tell you anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give you this thing and now you tell me what you think.</p>
<p>And as they progress, if they get stuck on a problem that maybe Bob and someone else</p>
<p>solved earlier, you can go, Hey, what about this?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to tell them where it came from.</p>
<p>What about this?</p>
<p>You can leapfrog and they get another two steps closer to the final answer.</p>
<p>And then we get stuck by our evolution of technology and you shelve it again.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s the right way to do it?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s heartbreaking.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, listen, I love government, but we just had this discussion about Elon and so</p>
<p>on.</p>
<p>The, the alternative approach is to release this to the world and say, there&rsquo;s a mystery</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>And then the Elons of the world, the Jeff Bezos, we talked about money, but it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>not just money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this engine that&rsquo;s within, we talked about the American dream to say, I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to be the one that cracks this mystery open.</p>
<p>And like, that&rsquo;s within a lot of us and like money aside, people in their garage just will.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re thinking like a scientist.</p>
<p>Now let me, now let&rsquo;s shift to, let me think like a country.</p>
<p>So we have country A, B, and C, and you can look at the nuclear arms race.</p>
<p>So we know that Germany was really close.</p>
<p>We know that Russia was getting pretty close.</p>
<p>We just won the race and we were the first ones with it.</p>
<p>And still to this day.</p>
<p>And Germany could have won.</p>
<p>They could have won.</p>
<p>They could have won, but someone was smart enough to not finish the equation when they</p>
<p>knew they had the answer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally what it comes down to.</p>
<p>Someone was smart enough to realize if that, that got into the hands of the Nazis, that</p>
<p>that would be the end.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s a tough call to do that, knowing that you have the answer and you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>solve the problem because it will go into the wrong end.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of the fear.</p>
<p>When you look at this, you go, okay, so if we do this, if we put it out there, we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got this technology.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t work on it kind of international space station, like we&rsquo;re all going to work</p>
<p>on it together in a, you know, like Antarctica is really supposed to be treaty free from</p>
<p>any weapons or anything.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re supposed to, you know, we&rsquo;ve got the international thing down there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all going to work together.</p>
<p>If you did it in a, in the confines of that and you could control the flow in and out,</p>
<p>because what you don&rsquo;t want is the, someone stealing information and getting it back to</p>
<p>where, and countries are notorious to do this, Hey, we&rsquo;re doing it internationally, but we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>secretly doing it ourselves to see who can come up with a solution first.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem because we have this inherent thing of power and technology like that is</p>
<p>power.</p>
<p>It would, it would literally change the game of the way the world operates and from not</p>
<p>just a transportation or mankind, but from a military aspect, it&rsquo;s got huge, huge.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I, so beautifully, beautifully presented and there&rsquo;s, I feel like there&rsquo;s a tension between</p>
<p>those two places, the scientist view of the world and the national security view of the</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>Let me, let me get to this kind of interesting point, which is a lot of conspiracy theorists</p>
<p>kind of paint a picture of government as an exceptionally, as a hierarchical system that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exceptionally competent and good at hiding secrets.</p>
<p>And then, I mean, I tend to not subscribe to almost any conspiracy theory, to the degree</p>
<p>at least that the conspiracy theorists do, but the, there does seem to be, and I tend</p>
<p>to think of government as unfortunately incompetent, at least the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>It seems that the communication, like the three videos that were released and just the</p>
<p>way of DOD in general talks about the things we&rsquo;ve been talking about, it&rsquo;s just confused.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s contradictory, it&rsquo;s not inspiring, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s suspicious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not even the way they released the videos.</p>
<p>You know, the Tic Tac, if presented correctly, could just inspire a generation of scientists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like at the, you know, us going to the moon and it&rsquo;s inspiring.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s incredible, you know, and, and the way it was released, it was suspicious.</p>
<p>It was like low resolution video on a crappy website, like with some crappy documents.</p>
<p>And I mean, why, what is it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to ask this question, but can government do better?</p>
<p>Why are they doing it this way in terms of communicating the things they do know to the</p>
<p>public?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how, especially in this topic, it&rsquo;s been hidden for so many years.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think, cause I don&rsquo;t buy off on the conspiracy stuff, I just think that, you</p>
<p>know, when it comes in, like I said, you know, the government has the right to classify stuff.</p>
<p>They classify everything cause they don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You have something, you don&rsquo;t know what it is, you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So we just go, well, it must be, it must be top secret and let&rsquo;s put it in a vault.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s kind of like the Indiana Jones where they take the ark and they put it in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the giant army warehouse.</p>
<p>You know, we don&rsquo;t even know what we have.</p>
<p>So, but I also believe that, you know, and I&rsquo;ll say this openly, I don&rsquo;t think that the</p>
<p>American people need to know everything.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a reason that stuff is classified for the protection of this country.</p>
<p>And I totally believe in that.</p>
<p>So, you know, I was joking with Joe when he was talking about the storm area 51.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, yeah, that&rsquo;s probably the worst idea you could possibly have is to just storm</p>
<p>a military installation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just stupid.</p>
<p>There are reasons, there are reasons that we have things that we don&rsquo;t just let out</p>
<p>to the public.</p>
<p>Because if we do, as soon as you do let someone know that you have something, they immediately</p>
<p>try to counter it.</p>
<p>And perfect example, the U.S. in the 60s developed a bomber, it was a Mach 3 compression lift</p>
<p>bomber called the XB 70.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>There was three of them built, three of them ever built.</p>
<p>It was a like 60,000 foot high, you know, Mach 3, it was an incredible airplane when</p>
<p>you see it, and there&rsquo;s actually the last one remaining is in Dayton, Ohio at the museum.</p>
<p>You know, it would go, the wingtips would fold on, it looks like a Concorde, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>way faster.</p>
<p>When that got out that we were developing it, the Soviet Union developed the MiG 25,</p>
<p>literally a high altitude interceptor to counter that bomber.</p>
<p>And they built an entire fleet of MiG 25s, right?</p>
<p>We built three XB 70s and we scrapped the program, right?</p>
<p>Because now you go, well, the technology is cool, we proved it, but now it becomes obsolete.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not even worth building a whole fleet of these things.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a chess game.</p>
<p>We do something, they do something, we do something, they do something, and we do something</p>
<p>and then they counter it.</p>
<p>You got to figure out how to defeat it.</p>
<p>So you go, oh, we&rsquo;ll build something.</p>
<p>So the more we keep quiet, especially from a defense standpoint, the better.</p>
<p>Actually, personally, I think we talk too much.</p>
<p>And I think the military and the DOD is starting to see that we&rsquo;re too open.</p>
<p>You announce, hey, we&rsquo;re building this because there&rsquo;s a budget line and we live in a free</p>
<p>society, but you don&rsquo;t have to release all the specs and you don&rsquo;t have to put everything</p>
<p>in open source.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a problem when we go to the universities.</p>
<p>If we want to go do work with MIT and you want to partner with MIT and you&rsquo;re a defense</p>
<p>company and you want to partner, you know, you guys have a rule that if you create it,</p>
<p>then it can be open source because the university owns it and we are an institution of learning.</p>
<p>Where the defense side might go, we don&rsquo;t really want that published in a paper in Scientific</p>
<p>America.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so heartbreaking.</p>
<p>I talked to CTO of Lockheed, Keiko Jackson, and just Concord&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Some of the best, if not the best engineering and science, but engineering really ever is</p>
<p>done in secrecy and it sucks because it&rsquo;s so inspiring and they can&rsquo;t talk about it.</p>
<p>It is, but some of it&rsquo;s due to funding.</p>
<p>The US government has deep pockets.</p>
<p>You know, some of this new technology that you develop for an open source and lesson,</p>
<p>this goes back to the original conversation.</p>
<p>We now, there&rsquo;s enough money in the private sector that individuals control.</p>
<p>Bezos, I&rsquo;m not talking Amazon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking Jeff Bezos, a single individual worth over a hundred billion dollars.</p>
<p>He has the ability to do stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what, the Gates Foundation with between Bill Gates and his wife and Warren</p>
<p>Buffett and some of the other money, because I think Bezos&rsquo;s ex wife actually donated a</p>
<p>huge chunk of her half into the Gates Foundation.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the Gates Foundation worth these days?</p>
<p>These are guys, brilliant, brilliant.</p>
<p>Some of the greatest minds that we have to go, what are they doing?</p>
<p>Because they have the ability to, it&rsquo;s a nonprofit, they can go, hey, I want to fund this.</p>
<p>I want to fund this research.</p>
<p>They can look beyond the conflict between nations.</p>
<p>You can look beyond the conflict of having to have classification.</p>
<p>You could do what you want.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, we classify how to do the whole nuclear, how to create a critical mass.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s really smart high school kids that have figured it out mathematically and</p>
<p>they do their science project.</p>
<p>And then the government comes in and says, hey, we got to classify your government because</p>
<p>we just don&rsquo;t want this out in the public domain, which I understand.</p>
<p>And they never stopped them from free thought and developing that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, hey, we really don&rsquo;t want this out there.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I understand that.</p>
<p>I totally understand that.</p>
<p>But if Bill and Melinda want to do this and go, hey, we want to do this and they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to work with Bezos and they&rsquo;re going to work with Elon and we&rsquo;re going to, I mean, you</p>
<p>think about it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a significant amount of money that could be available to R&amp;D and I&rsquo;m not talking</p>
<p>just science like this, I&rsquo;m talking medical research and all this.</p>
<p>But then you go, well, who gets it?</p>
<p>Because now you&rsquo;re competing against the companies that actually do it.</p>
<p>You go, is that, well, are they the greatest minds?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say, you know, we have a tendency to go, these are the best that we have.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d say, well, no, that&rsquo;s the best that we know we have.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s probably people out there that don&rsquo;t want to work.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s brilliant minds that don&rsquo;t want to do anything with defense because they just</p>
<p>disagree with what it does.</p>
<p>So they go to another path, they can do something else.</p>
<p>And in a sense, like the Elons of the world that Jeff Bezos actually in a certain sense</p>
<p>much better than DOD at finding the brilliant, weird minds out there.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re not tied to the government.</p>
<p>So when you work a government contract, the government writes, they tell you what they</p>
<p>want and then they work with you on the requirements and they usually have an end in mean.</p>
<p>You know, they have an idea that this is what I want it to be.</p>
<p>Where if you go to like SpaceX, where, you know, they come up with, why don&rsquo;t we just</p>
<p>land these things on a pad and reuse them?</p>
<p>Well, if the government scientist, if you&rsquo;re on a government contract says, no, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not the requirements.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not paying for that.</p>
<p>We want you to do this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re kind of controlled.</p>
<p>Or when Elon does it, his company, they can do whatever the hell they want to do because</p>
<p>they have no bounds.</p>
<p>The only bounds they have is the liability if it doesn&rsquo;t work and it lands on something.</p>
<p>So what do you do?</p>
<p>You go out to Kwajalein and you test it.</p>
<p>And if it crashes and it lands in the ocean, hey, we clean it up.</p>
<p>No big deal.</p>
<p>We lost some money, but we&rsquo;ll move on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, money makes the world go around contrary to what everyone thinks.</p>
<p>But, you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of money that&rsquo;s sitting around that you can do a lot of really</p>
<p>cool stuff with.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ll guarantee that, what is it, Blue Origin, isn&rsquo;t that Amazon?</p>
<p>You know, that they&rsquo;re doing some cool stuff because they have funny.</p>
<p>And I joke with the guy I know that worked at SpaceX and he was funny because they were</p>
<p>building the first test thing and they were limited.</p>
<p>And Elon found this like 400 acre thing, I think it&rsquo;s about 400 acres down by Waco, Texas.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, I go, how, he goes, dude, I worked, he goes, I worked with, he goes, because</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s done government contract.</p>
<p>He goes, there&rsquo;s government contract.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s working at SpaceX with Elon money.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what he refers to it as, is Elon money, where it was like, don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll throw</p>
<p>them and he would throw the money at it and make it happen.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m talking this fast.</p>
<p>I mean, he talks about, he has a great story about this.</p>
<p>I mean, this is Elon, but this is how fast you can do in the private sector vice the</p>
<p>government where there&rsquo;s the bureaucracy is.</p>
<p>They had a company that was a, basically a tool and die machine shop that did a lot of</p>
<p>their high precision parts for the rockets.</p>
<p>They had went to the guy, but he had contracts with other companies.</p>
<p>And when the economy was down, the guy was actually looking at going out of business.</p>
<p>So the guy I know, he&rsquo;s telling me the story.</p>
<p>He was talking to the guy, he had to go over there and get something.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, holy shit.</p>
<p>He goes, hang on.</p>
<p>So he calls up on the phone, SpaceX, he says, Hey, is Elon there?</p>
<p>Can you get them in the boardroom?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be there in 20 minutes.</p>
<p>So he grabs this guy who&rsquo;s literally going to fold his company.</p>
<p>They go over to SpaceX and I may be getting some of this wrong if people are going to</p>
<p>fact check me, but this is pretty close.</p>
<p>They go in the boardroom and he said, literally within like an hour or two, Elon has bought</p>
<p>the guy&rsquo;s company.</p>
<p>That guy is now a senior VP running his company.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going to pull all the stuff into the SpaceX thing so they can actually build</p>
<p>the parts and they can still contract out to make the money outside.</p>
<p>And it happened like that fast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just money, it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve witnessed it too with Elon.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s whatever the forces of capitalism that allow a person like Elon Musk to rise</p>
<p>to the top, because I&rsquo;ve also worked for DARPA for research in terms of a source of funding.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a weight of bureaucracy when I was working, being funded by DARPA.</p>
<p>And with Elon, I was literally in the presence of anything is possible, cutting across all</p>
<p>the bullshit of paperwork, of the way things were done in the past, of the bureaucracy,</p>
<p>the rules, the constraints, all of that stuff, just you can cut across immediately.</p>
<p>How much money and time do you waste dealing with your bureaucracy when you could actually</p>
<p>be doing real work?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the difference.</p>
<p>This is why I honestly, when I went back to the industrial defense complex that we were</p>
<p>warned about, when you look at it and go, SpaceX can do something for half the price</p>
<p>ahead of schedule that what Boeing, we&rsquo;re paying Boeing, and you go, oh, well, this</p>
<p>just came out.</p>
<p>And you go, well, then why are we even dealing with this side when we can deal with this</p>
<p>side?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve got a fully automated capsule that has a manual mode that they got to fly</p>
<p>around in.</p>
<p>It worked like a champ.</p>
<p>It went up, it hung out, it came back, it splashed down.</p>
<p>It worked perfectly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to dust it off.</p>
<p>And oh, by the way, unlike the Apollo capsules that were used and then put to museums, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to reuse that dragon capsule.</p>
<p>It came down, they&rsquo;re going to dust it off, put a new coat of paint on it, slap it on</p>
<p>top of another rocket and away it goes.</p>
<p>Holy cow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shift.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complete shift in mentality.</p>
<p>And for us as taxpayers, we can explore at half the cost.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exciting, especially given putting the Tic Tac in context, like then the sky or it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>limitless the possibilities we could do with this kind of mechanism.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think we live in an exciting time right now.</p>
<p>This is everything that&rsquo;s messed up in the world right now.</p>
<p>Well, this is a hopeful, like there&rsquo;s so much conflict going on, so much tension.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s to me, space exploration at the moment is a reason to get up in the morning and have</p>
<p>a hope for the future, to look up to the sky and we&rsquo;re humans.</p>
<p>We can solve so many, we can solve all of this.</p>
<p>I was talking about when I was doing the Tucker thing and I said, this would be great, because</p>
<p>then the government had come out a month ago and said, hey, this does exist.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing this and we&rsquo;re going to release more stuff.</p>
<p>And I was texting like Lou and Chris Mellon and those guys before I went on, because they</p>
<p>had called me up to be on Tucker&rsquo;s show and I&rsquo;m like, hey, I go, this would be great.</p>
<p>Just come out with this, find the relic of a spaceship, like pull out the Roswell wreckage</p>
<p>if you have it, pull out the Roswell wreckage and do it.</p>
<p>God, it would be so nice to not have to deal with the riots in the cities.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s an election year and all that, but God, it would be refreshing to not have</p>
<p>to turn on my TV and see everything that is just depressing in the world.</p>
<p>To begin, holy cow, we actually do have this and we&rsquo;re working on this technology.</p>
<p>Imagine if there is a Roswell aircraft and they pull it out, imagine the innovation that</p>
<p>happens in the next 10 to 20 years without any more information than that.</p>
<p>Just the innovation that happens, the look on Elon Musk&rsquo;s face, the look on Jeff Bezos&rsquo;s</p>
<p>face and all the brilliance in years.</p>
<p>It would change the game.</p>
<p>It would change the game completely.</p>
<p>Let me ask the big question, I apologize for the absurd romantic nature of it.</p>
<p>Outside, I mean, one of the things, the fact that you&rsquo;ve laid your eyes on a UFO probably</p>
<p>opened your eyes to the possibility that some of the other sightings, there could be other</p>
<p>sightings that have legitimacy to them.</p>
<p>What to you is the, outside of your own sighting, is the most interesting sighting or UFO related</p>
<p>event in history?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s several.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Ramassan Forest in England, the US guys that saw stuff and actually got radiation burns.</p>
<p>One guy was medically disabled, but they weren&rsquo;t going to give him and he had help from John</p>
<p>McCain.</p>
<p>His office helped get the guy&rsquo;s disability reestablished.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a big one.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s people out there that have seen stuff and I&rsquo;m talking credible because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, you got to remember, there&rsquo;s a huge chunk of the sightings that get disproven.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually explainable.</p>
<p>You had sent me the question, the Phoenix lights, I think there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m not familiar with some of these.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not either, you want a funny story on that.</p>
<p>So I was at a conference, hopefully he doesn&rsquo;t watch this and get offended, but we had this,</p>
<p>I call it speed dating.</p>
<p>So there was a table, about eight people at a table and we would go sit at the table and</p>
<p>they could ask us questions and then after 10 minutes we moved to the next table.</p>
<p>So I was speed dating all these people that are really into this.</p>
<p>It was kind of funny, but I had sat down and it&rsquo;s always funny because some people will</p>
<p>try and dominate it, but you have to kind of push the dominators away so that if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>quiet and introverted, you can ask your question too.</p>
<p>So we got into this and the guy starts naming all these, well, what about this?</p>
<p>What about the Phoenix lights?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t know about the Phoenix lights.</p>
<p>What about this event?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that.</p>
<p>He goes, he looks at me and he goes, well, you&rsquo;re not a UFO guy.</p>
<p>I go, no, I&rsquo;m not, but I chased one.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m an expert.</p>
<p>Have you?</p>
<p>And you could see him get deflated because I&rsquo;m kind of a smart ass like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean the firsthand experience from a credible, in some sense these sightings</p>
<p>have to do both with the evidence and the human.</p>
<p>Well, I think part of that is to us, that&rsquo;s a credibility piece because the four of us</p>
<p>that actually saw it, plus the other two that were in the airplane that shot the video,</p>
<p>none of us are UFO obsessed people.</p>
<p>So when we come out and say, because to me it&rsquo;s five minutes of my life, I did a lot</p>
<p>of really cool, I&rsquo;ve had really kind of neat things I&rsquo;ve been able to do.</p>
<p>But when you look at it and go, to me it&rsquo;s not the pinnacle of my life.</p>
<p>To other people that they live in the UFO world and it&rsquo;s like they, if you talk to people</p>
<p>that are really into it, who&rsquo;ve never seen one, it kills them that they didn&rsquo;t see one.</p>
<p>When here we are, and what&rsquo;s unique with ours, which kind of adds that level is we just didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see it.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like, oh look, something in the sky and it was weird.</p>
<p>We actually engaged with it, it was an engaged five minute thing.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s other stories from other countries, like there&rsquo;s a story in the back when the</p>
<p>Soviet Union existed that they actually would chase these things and one of them shot at</p>
<p>some, it shot it because they said shoot at it and it shot it and then it got shot down.</p>
<p>And then they said, don&rsquo;t ever shoot at them again and don&rsquo;t chase them, just you can observe</p>
<p>them, but don&rsquo;t go after them because obviously they have firepower that we can&rsquo;t control</p>
<p>because if you can make something float around and jam radars at will and do whatever you</p>
<p>want, modern terrestrial weapons are probably not very useful.</p>
<p>You can go to Independence Day, they had that force field around, oh, we got to, now you</p>
<p>got a cyber warfare, you got to take the bug down, you got to take the warfare, so now</p>
<p>we can actually inhibit some type of damage.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, I mean, you mentioned the Phoenix lights, somebody on I think Reddit said, ask</p>
<p>them any thoughts on mass UFO sightings like the Phoenix lights.</p>
<p>So the interesting thing, like you said with the Tic Tac is that multiple people laid their</p>
<p>eyes on this.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about the Phoenix lights where many people have seen it?</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the deal with massive sightings.</p>
<p>So the Phoenix lights is unexplainable, although I know the Air Force had said something about</p>
<p>it was an A10 drop in flares.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Flares don&rsquo;t burn that long, they just come out and they detract and they go away.</p>
<p>Although on the other hand, there&rsquo;s, because clouds can do things, so I lived in Central</p>
<p>California for 18 years and you would get, oh my God, what was that in the sky and it</p>
<p>was really Vandenberg shooting a missile off.</p>
<p>They were doing ICBM tests at one time where they shoot from Vandenberg and they fly across</p>
<p>and they go land in the Atoll at Kwajalein and then they can check the displacement,</p>
<p>the accuracy and all that stuff, it&rsquo;s stuff that we do because we&rsquo;re a superpower.</p>
<p>But when you see them go up, especially if you&rsquo;ve ever watched a rocket really launch</p>
<p>on a clear night, it&rsquo;ll have the stream, the glow, and you can tell it&rsquo;s a rocket, but</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t look up until later when it starts to get to the outer edge of the atmosphere</p>
<p>where the plume coming out of the engine is not constrained, and you can watch this on</p>
<p>TV when even the SpaceX ones go up, it&rsquo;s nice and narrow, narrow, narrow, and then it hits</p>
<p>a point where it really starts to go up and it starts to come to the sides because the</p>
<p>forces aren&rsquo;t holding that all into one unique thing and it looks really odd and then it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>go off because it burns out and then you get stage separation, then you see the next one</p>
<p>go off and then it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>And people don&rsquo;t understand that because they didn&rsquo;t watch it from launch because we used</p>
<p>to sit in our driveway and Vandenberg, it was a three hour drive, but you could sit and</p>
<p>watch it.</p>
<p>You knew they were launching at night, you&rsquo;d watch, you&rsquo;d watch and it&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t see anything, what you see is the weird clouds from the exhaust plume, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>left, the residue that&rsquo;s sitting in the atmosphere and the wind starts blowing it so you get</p>
<p>these really kind of weird shapes in the sky.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part, but when you go to Phoenix Lights and you go, hey, when a thousand people see</p>
<p>something, are you going to discredit all a thousand people or are you going to try</p>
<p>and explain it away with something else, you know, it&rsquo;s a weather balloon, it&rsquo;s a weather</p>
<p>balloon.</p>
<p>Again, just like the Tic Tac, I think is just inspiring for the limitless nature of the</p>
<p>science.</p>
<p>I think more is going to come out.</p>
<p>I think some of the stuff that the To The Stars folks have done.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a To The Stars Academy.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about them?</p>
<p>Are they?</p>
<p>I talk to them quite a bit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a part of To The Stars Academy.</p>
<p>But I talked to Lou, I just was texting him before this.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s their mission?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s their hope?</p>
<p>When they started, their mission was to try and, don&rsquo;t look at this as little green men,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s look at this as a technology and let&rsquo;s try and almost reverse engineer and</p>
<p>figure out how these things operate and how can we explain this from using our knowledge,</p>
<p>workspace knowledge to go, how would something like this operate?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really their bottom line was to try and use and then couple that with, because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got the series unidentified, couple that with television to get the word out.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re actually putting something instead of&hellip;</p>
<p>Because everyone has a theory, you know, Ancient Aliens covers all kinds of theories, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of off of, oh my God, and I&rsquo;ve seen the stuff and I&rsquo;ve seen stuff that I&rsquo;ve said</p>
<p>taken out of context on shows that I did not talk to.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s all that, because you can take a clip and go, oh, it&rsquo;s this, it&rsquo;s that, you</p>
<p>know?</p>
<p>And if I know about stuff like it, you can&rsquo;t technically use my likeness unless I tell</p>
<p>you you can.</p>
<p>So if I haven&rsquo;t signed something you can&rsquo;t do, there was a guy who put something out,</p>
<p>you know, I was in it and I told him, you can take it down and you can talk to lawyers</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not supporting you.</p>
<p>So they use it to tell some kind of narrative that&rsquo;s not connected to reality.</p>
<p>Because let&rsquo;s face it, if you&rsquo;re making TV shows, there&rsquo;s two reasons to do it.</p>
<p>One, you want to get word out, or two, you want to make money, or three, both.</p>
<p>And so usually it&rsquo;s, I would say the make money is probably the biggest thing to put</p>
<p>a TV show out.</p>
<p>And the mission of the To The Stars Academy is to not do that, is to try to get some&hellip;</p>
<p>When they started and I talked to them, because I&rsquo;ve talked to Tom and I&rsquo;ve talked to Lou</p>
<p>and those are the two main players, it was to basically demystify the fact and get rid</p>
<p>of the stigma that&rsquo;s tied to UFOs, and let&rsquo;s look at it from a science base and then use</p>
<p>TV to get the word out on the progress.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve done some pretty cool things.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, the Italian government gave them all kinds of files that had been property</p>
<p>of their government.</p>
<p>They got a bunch from&hellip;</p>
<p>It might have been Argentina gave them all kinds of stuff, like, here&rsquo;s all our records,</p>
<p>what can you do with it?</p>
<p>To try and now pull from country based to a more global based research, which is what</p>
<p>you were talking about, and then using independent scientists that are not tied to a government.</p>
<p>I mean, any government, but just using independent research agencies to start looking at some</p>
<p>of the metallurgy, because you go, oh, I found this, we had this piece of metal, what is</p>
<p>it?</p>
<p>And some of the stuff has been explained.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got some objects, artifacts that have not been explained.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s slowly coming out, you know, and I think&hellip;</p>
<p>And your hope is the US government will release some more things?</p>
<p>The US government came out a month ago and said, we have material that we cannot explain</p>
<p>the origin.</p>
<p>They have said that.</p>
<p>They just haven&rsquo;t released the records from the Roswell thing, which I keep joking about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, come on, it&rsquo;s 70 some years old.</p>
<p>I mean, like, let it out.</p>
<p>I think you put it beautifully that in this time, that will be a heck of an inspiring,</p>
<p>hopeful thing to see.</p>
<p>Like people don&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>Just to distract them.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah, the division is, I mean, nothing will unite us humans, descendants of chimps.</p>
<p>Like the idea that there&rsquo;s life out there.</p>
<p>It would literally change.</p>
<p>I said this a while ago, I think it was the London Sun Times had called me and I said,</p>
<p>you know, personally, I think this is a global issue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>If there is stuff coming down, which we&rsquo;re pretty sure there is, there&rsquo;s enough stuff</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t explain.</p>
<p>If there is stuff coming down, then this is not a country based thing and it&rsquo;s not about</p>
<p>technology and it&rsquo;s not about who&rsquo;s going to win the next war because you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So you got really a couple of theories.</p>
<p>One, you&rsquo;ve got ET or close encounters and the other extreme is you&rsquo;ve got Independence</p>
<p>Day.</p>
<p>Are you going to prepare and bet on ET and close encounters or do you actually try and</p>
<p>do stuff in case it is Independence Day, you actually have a game plan.</p>
<p>And when you get into Independence Day, that scenario, you know, and I don&rsquo;t like going</p>
<p>too much into sci fi, but let&rsquo;s just say in theory that that becomes a reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a US, Russia, China, England, France, Spain, name any country in any continent.</p>
<p>It becomes a global issue and the only way you can deny it, it&rsquo;s just like Americans.</p>
<p>We all, you know, we&rsquo;re divided.</p>
<p>We spend that way forever.</p>
<p>So if you think we won&rsquo;t get through this, we&rsquo;ll get through it because we&rsquo;ve had times</p>
<p>just like this before.</p>
<p>Until Nazi Germany pops up.</p>
<p>But Nazi Germany pops up or someone flies two airplanes into the World Trade Center</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden we&rsquo;re all like united.</p>
<p>We all also have very, very short memories.</p>
<p>Yes, we do.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when you look and go, well, we can do this and you go, no, no, if you think that</p>
<p>everyone on the planet is good, you need to stop taking the drugs that you&rsquo;re taking.</p>
<p>You know, we said this, there were people during the rise of Hitler, no, no, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>And no, no, it&rsquo;s OK.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to do.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to stop.</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s OK.</p>
<p>The only thing that stopped Hitler was his ego by going into Russia.</p>
<p>If he just stuck with the pact with Stalin and not went to the east and had to fight</p>
<p>and it was really the Russian winner that crushed him and he would have put all his</p>
<p>high troops to the other side, there would have been a totally different outcome.</p>
<p>The man in the iron, the man in the high tower, whatever, it&rsquo;s a Netflix show where Nazi actually</p>
<p>wins it.</p>
<p>And you look, you know, we didn&rsquo;t know everything that was going on, especially the atrocities</p>
<p>with the concentration camps and what he was doing to the Jews.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s you look at that going, if you really want to see evil and then there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>whole side of what Stalin did because he actually exterminated more people than Hitler did.</p>
<p>But that never gets the press.</p>
<p>And the thing is, we forget this, we forget this history in our conflicts today.</p>
<p>We forget that there is the nature of evil.</p>
<p>We forget that there&rsquo;s real evil in the world.</p>
<p>And the thing to fight that evil is to be united, to be both.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this interesting line, like you talked about Joe Rogan, of being both like</p>
<p>kind to each other, compassionate, empathetic, but also being like strong and a bad motherfucker</p>
<p>when you need to, to make sure that you, that like there&rsquo;s a balance between kindness and</p>
<p>force.</p>
<p>You use force when force is necessary, but you don&rsquo;t have to walk around like Billy</p>
<p>Badass all the time.</p>
<p>I mean, some of the toughest people that I grew up with that literally could kick the</p>
<p>shit out of whoever came near them, they never got in fights because one, even people that</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know them, because they were actually nice guys.</p>
<p>You know, they were just good dudes.</p>
<p>But you know, if you cross them, like I had a friend of mine, he&rsquo;s a nationally ranked</p>
<p>wrestler.</p>
<p>He went to Naval Academy with me, he&rsquo;s a very, very good friend of mine.</p>
<p>And he is, when you meet him and he wrestled at 190 pounds and he did not lose a match</p>
<p>his senior year until he went to nationals, he just had a bad day.</p>
<p>He actually lost to a guy he had pummeled the shit out of.</p>
<p>And he would cross.</p>
<p>It was funny, we joke about it even with him, because when you meet him, he&rsquo;s like the nicest</p>
<p>like local, hey dude, you know, hey, how are you doing?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s super nice.</p>
<p>And he would cross that ring on a wrestling mat.</p>
<p>As soon as he crossed that ring, it was like a totally different person and he would go</p>
<p>out there and just destroy people.</p>
<p>I mean, physically destroy, like put a hurt on.</p>
<p>And he would get done and he&rsquo;s like super humble and they&rsquo;d raise his hand and he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>have this blank expression, they&rsquo;d raise his hand and he&rsquo;d walk off and as soon as he crossed</p>
<p>the line, he&rsquo;d look up and smile and go, hey, hi guys, how you doing?</p>
<p>Like he literally just went and could rip someone&rsquo;s arms off.</p>
<p>But as soon as he crossed the line, he was a totally different person.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, and he&rsquo;s that way today.</p>
<p>He won&rsquo;t even tell you he&rsquo;s a wrestler.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of a symbol of the best of America.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what America is.</p>
<p>Oh, he&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>That wrestler.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a.</p>
<p>You cross the line, you can be hard, but once you&rsquo;re off the mat, you&rsquo;re just a kind human</p>
<p>being.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re super humble, saying it&rsquo;s better to be lucky than good, but your story is inspiring.</p>
<p>The entire trajectory of having a dream, of accomplishing that dream, of having one hell</p>
<p>of a career.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to a young person, to a young version of yourself today that</p>
<p>listens to this and is inspired, that wants to fly or wants to go to space and wants to</p>
<p>build the rocket?</p>
<p>Is there advice you could give them about life, about career, about anything?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>First, let me start with, and you had a question on, inspirational people.</p>
<p>My grandfather, I had mentioned him earlier, huge funeral, beer delivery guy, was delivering</p>
<p>beer in the 60s riots where the guys in the black neighborhoods where white people didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>go.</p>
<p>My grandfather&rsquo;s Sicilian.</p>
<p>He was one of the first ones in his family born in the United States.</p>
<p>My great grandmother and I had aunts and uncles that I knew growing up that actually came</p>
<p>over on the boat.</p>
<p>Huge, huge guy and just the nicest, friendliest, would give you the shirt off his back, obviously</p>
<p>proven by his funeral.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking at his funeral, the head of the Black Panthers was at his funeral in Toledo,</p>
<p>Ohio.</p>
<p>The mafia guys were at his funeral in Toledo, Ohio.</p>
<p>It was literally a mix of who&rsquo;s who.</p>
<p>He had told me once, because when you&rsquo;re little, you start looking.</p>
<p>I grew up basically, I was probably middle class, lower middle class.</p>
<p>My dad was a fireman.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not rich.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s working for the city.</p>
<p>Paycheck to paycheck living is how I grew up.</p>
<p>I was talking to my grandfather one day and he said something to me, and this is literally</p>
<p>how I run my life.</p>
<p>He said, it was about money because you&rsquo;d see back in the day, if you saw someone in</p>
<p>a Mercedes, that was rare.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t everywhere.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t lease a car, you actually bought a car and usually bought a car with cash.</p>
<p>It was a totally different than we are now.</p>
<p>He said, he goes, you know, David, he goes, they&rsquo;re no better than you and you&rsquo;re no better</p>
<p>than anyone else.</p>
<p>He goes, you got to remember that.</p>
<p>He goes, everyone&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>He goes, treat everyone with the respect and dignity that they deserve.</p>
<p>He goes, and if they&rsquo;re poor, if they&rsquo;re homeless, he goes, it doesn&rsquo;t make them a bad person.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s who they chose to be and you make choices in your life, but never ever look down on</p>
<p>someone because there will always be someone that will look down on you and you should</p>
<p>never ever do that.</p>
<p>I kept that close to me.</p>
<p>He was a huge influence, my mom&rsquo;s dad, just a big, big influence in my life and the way</p>
<p>I carried myself.</p>
<p>He was one that would say, you can be anything you want to be.</p>
<p>He grew up dirt poor and the fact that he had bought a house and took good care of my</p>
<p>grandmother and did stuff like that, to him, that was a success.</p>
<p>To me, it was always trying to better and move on.</p>
<p>He was the one, my parents were a big part of this too, was instilling that anything</p>
<p>is possible.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m four years and 11 months old in 1969 and I&rsquo;m watching Neil Armstrong walk on the</p>
<p>moon and I&rsquo;m asking my mom and she says, well, they were all military pilots.</p>
<p>We had an Air National Guard that at the time was flying F100, so I&rsquo;m dating myself.</p>
<p>I was just fascinated with flight and I just looked at that going, that&rsquo;s really what I</p>
<p>want to do.</p>
<p>I never lost sight of that.</p>
<p>There was always, I could do this or do that.</p>
<p>When I was going to go to college before I enlisted in the Marine Corps, I was accepted</p>
<p>into Natural Resources at Ohio State and I&rsquo;m like, if I can&rsquo;t fly, I&rsquo;ll go be a forest</p>
<p>ranger because I wanted to hang out in one of those towers in Colorado and look for</p>
<p>fires because that&rsquo;s just, I like that stuff.</p>
<p>It was that or be an oceanographer because I was fascinated with Jacques Cousteau and</p>
<p>actually that&rsquo;s my degree.</p>
<p>My undergrad degree is Jacques Cousteau, so influences are Neil Armstrong and Jacques</p>
<p>Cousteau.</p>
<p>I have an oceanography degree.</p>
<p>I got an MBA from University of Houston, go Cougs, got to mention them.</p>
<p>So you look and people go, what are you going to do with that?</p>
<p>And I said, I got an oceanography degree because I got, well, I&rsquo;m going to sail on the ocean,</p>
<p>so at least if the ship sinks, I&rsquo;ll know where I&rsquo;m at and that was a kind of a running joke</p>
<p>and then&hellip;</p>
<p>So these passions and underneath it is the belief that you can be anything you want to</p>
<p>be.</p>
<p>You can.</p>
<p>I told my kids this, when they were young, it was tough, especially for my son.</p>
<p>So when Nate was about five, six years, we knew Nate was colorblind.</p>
<p>My wife&rsquo;s brothers are both colorblind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really color deprived.</p>
<p>Color blind, you see black and white.</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t tell.</p>
<p>He has issues with greens, reds, browns.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny if you&rsquo;re ever around someone like that because he&rsquo;ll go, what are you looking</p>
<p>at?</p>
<p>He goes right over there by the red thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what are you looking at?</p>
<p>I go, this?</p>
<p>He had a hat on one day.</p>
<p>I go, which one are you going to get?</p>
<p>He had a hat in his hand.</p>
<p>It was green.</p>
<p>He goes, I&rsquo;m going to get the green one.</p>
<p>I go, oh, this one right here.</p>
<p>He goes, no, the one on my head.</p>
<p>I go, Nate, that one&rsquo;s brown.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, leave me alone, dad.</p>
<p>He got the brown hat because to him it looked great.</p>
<p>So he couldn&rsquo;t fly.</p>
<p>He came to me and said, I go, what do you want to do, Nate?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking to your kids and what do you want to do?</p>
<p>He goes, I want to be a pilot.</p>
<p>Now I got to tell him because he&rsquo;s looking at me because I&rsquo;m a pilot, you can&rsquo;t be a</p>
<p>pilot.</p>
<p>I go, why can&rsquo;t I be a pilot, I said, because you got eye issues, so you got to redirect.</p>
<p>The other one was because I stopped flying when I was 42 years old and it was my childhood</p>
<p>dream.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a pro athlete.</p>
<p>I know exactly what it feels like when Brett Favre has to walk away from the NFL when you</p>
<p>still can do it.</p>
<p>Good choice of quarterback, by the way, the greatest of all time, but whatever.</p>
<p>So you do and you look at it and you go, I understand what those guys feel like when</p>
<p>you have to walk away from something that you love and you think you can still do it.</p>
<p>So I told them, I said, look, I was talking to both of my kids and I said, you know, find</p>
<p>something that you want to do, that you love to do and that you can do your whole life.</p>
<p>And you should be able to do good things for other people.</p>
<p>You want to be able to help other people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I said.</p>
<p>So both of my kids and there&rsquo;s no one in my family, both of my children, one of them</p>
<p>is, my daughter is a doctor doing a residency in internal medicine right now.</p>
<p>And my son is in his third year and they&rsquo;re both going to be doctors.</p>
<p>And until I look at it as, you know, people go, oh, you got two doctors.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I told my kids, if you want to be a garbage man or you want to dig ditches, I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Just be, be the best ditch digger that you can be, I said, and be happy doing it.</p>
<p>Because what you also find is that we are in this big pursuit of money, money, money,</p>
<p>money, money, money, money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes the world go round.</p>
<p>But what you realize, and I&rsquo;ll go back to my grandfather who didn&rsquo;t have a lot of money</p>
<p>and he was probably one of the most happy people on life.</p>
<p>And unfortunately he died at, he died at 65.</p>
<p>He had a massive heart attack because he didn&rsquo;t tell that he, he kind of knew it was happening</p>
<p>and he just made the choice to do it and it was devastating to the entire family.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t, he didn&rsquo;t have a lot of money.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll tell you what, I know a lot of rich people who have funerals and there&rsquo;s nobody</p>
<p>at them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And my grandfather, who&rsquo;s a beer delivery guy had, I, I, it literally, it was like three</p>
<p>miles long.</p>
<p>The Pope.</p>
<p>It was crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Who died?</p>
<p>The Pope.</p>
<p>That was because there was like, Hey, he&rsquo;s a Catholic.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just, you know, Italian.</p>
<p>He goes, you know, who died?</p>
<p>The Pope.</p>
<p>And I go, no, that was my grandfather.</p>
<p>And then the next funeral I went to was my aunt, his sister.</p>
<p>And it was like, you know, 30 people.</p>
<p>And I looked at my mother and I said, where&rsquo;s everybody at?</p>
<p>She goes, Oh, no, this is normal.</p>
<p>This is what a normal funeral looks like.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, you know, for young kids, bottom line, one, be nice.</p>
<p>Kindness will get you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer in karma.</p>
<p>Kindness will get you a long way in the world.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s easy to be nice.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t cost you anything.</p>
<p>I said, you know, and get rid of the hate.</p>
<p>And number two is follow your dreams because everyone is capable of everything.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a self realism, like, you know, if you really have trouble with</p>
<p>math, getting a PhD in applied math is probably not something you&rsquo;re going to be able to do,</p>
<p>but understand yourself, what your own capabilities are.</p>
<p>And you know, inside your heart, don&rsquo;t let anyone ever tell you what you can and can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do.</p>
<p>Just look at yourself and go for it and, and, and you can do anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a great, the world&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>It really is.</p>
<p>Let me ask the last big, ridiculous question.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve lived much of your life, your career is kind of at the edge of life and death.</p>
<p>So let me ask kind of several different ways, the same kind of question.</p>
<p>One, do you, have you pondered your mortality, the finiteness of it?</p>
<p>And the bigger question to ask, even in the context of your, uh, tic tac encounter is,</p>
<p>uh, what do you think is the meaning of this, uh, thing we got going on here?</p>
<p>The meaning of life, human life in this sense.</p>
<p>So let me start with, have I pondered my own mortality?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Very often.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t get into my religious beliefs or what I am, but I will tell you that I do</p>
<p>believe in God.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just seen too many things in the world that I can&rsquo;t explain.</p>
<p>And some people will explain it by subconscious, so I&rsquo;ll give you a story and this kind of</p>
<p>puts in the thing of, do I fear death?</p>
<p>So I had a good friend of mine that I used to fly with, we were stationed in Japan together</p>
<p>and Japan had this incinerator that put all kinds of dioxins, so there&rsquo;s a real high cancer</p>
<p>rate for those that served on the base in Atsugi, Japan.</p>
<p>Him and his wife had one son, um, and their son passed away just before his 18th birthday</p>
<p>of cancer.</p>
<p>And I was hanging out with, I&rsquo;ll call him John, and I was hanging out with John, we</p>
<p>were in oil and gas, he had come to the same company and we were doing an event together</p>
<p>and he was opening up to me because we were actually the demo pilots.</p>
<p>We do the demonstration for air shows and stuff and him and I were sitting there talking</p>
<p>and he was giving me the whole story and how it really changed his look on life that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>only here for a finite time and that we&rsquo;re all going to die.</p>
<p>Well, unfortunately, after all that, when it was really going, him and his wife had</p>
<p>moved to a location that would fit their, you know, close to the water where they could</p>
<p>do stuff and I won&rsquo;t say where, and he was doing what he loved to do and he got diagnosed</p>
<p>with throat cancer.</p>
<p>And I was talking to him, uh, it was probably about maybe two months before he died, um,</p>
<p>and I said, dude, hey, you&rsquo;re sad, I mean, this is your friend and I&rsquo;m kind of really</p>
<p>bummed out and this is the guy, this is a guy that&rsquo;s dying of cancer and here&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>he tells me.</p>
<p>He says, Dave, dude, we&rsquo;re all going to die.</p>
<p>He goes, but I have to look at it, I have to make the best of the time that I have.</p>
<p>And I said, I understand that.</p>
<p>And he goes, with the exception of not being with my wife, who he loved dearly, he goes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m okay with dying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a really good life and, um, about, uh, cause actually the original announcement</p>
<p>when he, when he finally passed away, a buddy of mine called me cause I don&rsquo;t do Facebook</p>
<p>and his wife had put it on Facebook that he had passed and about the day before he died,</p>
<p>for some reason I was thinking about him and I had a dream or I think it was a dream or</p>
<p>an altered reality.</p>
<p>You can get into whatever, uh, but he was there, it was just him and I, and I was really</p>
<p>sad in the dream.</p>
<p>I was actually crying and he was there and he was actually in his uniform.</p>
<p>He was in his whites and uh, cause he was a Navy and we were just talking and he looked</p>
<p>at me and he said, and this isn&rsquo;t my dream.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, Dave, it&rsquo;s all going to be okay.</p>
<p>And this is, this is like, and this is a vivid conversation I have.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people are gonna think I&rsquo;m weird about this, but, um, but I, you know, I know what</p>
<p>my dream was and you know, maybe it&rsquo;s my subconscious creating the dream, but in reality to me,</p>
<p>this was real, that it was put there for a reason.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s and he basically explained everything he&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be fine.</p>
<p>My wife is fine.</p>
<p>He goes, this is, this is what&rsquo;s meant to be, you know, but you know, and the bottom</p>
<p>line was make use of every day that you have because you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And literally two days later, I find out that he passed.</p>
<p>Um, so, but ultimately he accepted the finiteness of it.</p>
<p>He did.</p>
<p>Well, you have to, and it&rsquo;s like, I talk about, you know, money and job position and this</p>
<p>and that, and I said, you can get in any, you know, you can go to a company.</p>
<p>Just remember when you want to be a VP of a company, you sell your soul to the company.</p>
<p>You have to, I said, if you look, I joke with people at work and I said, I said, you know,</p>
<p>when you ever think that you&rsquo;re important or this guy has that, I said, when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sitting on 93 or 95, one 28 and you&rsquo;re sitting in traffic and we&rsquo;re stopped, which doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>happen right now because of COVID, but normally it&rsquo;s stopped.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bumper to bumper and you&rsquo;re sitting here like I was coming down here by the gas tank.</p>
<p>Um, when you&rsquo;re sitting there, look left and look right, you know, and there can be a Lamborghini</p>
<p>or an S five 50 Mercedes.</p>
<p>And on the other side, there could be some piece of crap car.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all sitting on the same freeway at the same time, trying to do the same thing, which</p>
<p>is just get home so we can be with our family because the most important thing that we have,</p>
<p>it ain&rsquo;t money.</p>
<p>It ain&rsquo;t our job.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not our position.</p>
<p>I go, cause when it&rsquo;s all said and done, you could be, you know, you can be with the exception</p>
<p>of the presidents of the United States.</p>
<p>I mean, name the vice presidents.</p>
<p>Most people can&rsquo;t and eventually they&rsquo;re going to die or eventually you&rsquo;re going to see a</p>
<p>statue of a guy from the 17 hundreds in the Boston area and you&rsquo;re going to go, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even know who that guy was.</p>
<p>Did he impact my life?</p>
<p>He probably did, but eventually people forget you realize what&rsquo;s important now and the one</p>
<p>thing that you have is your family and your close friends and that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>You can take all the money or everything else.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re down on your luck, you know, who is going to be, we, I just joke, who are your</p>
<p>true friends?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the person.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a once that I won&rsquo;t say, but you know, Hey, you&rsquo;re broke down</p>
<p>on a road in the middle of nowhere and it&rsquo;s three oclock in the morning, who you going</p>
<p>to call is going to get in their car without complaining and come and get you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>That is life.</p>
<p>The people you love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the people you truly care about.</p>
<p>And contrary to, I have, you know, Oh my God, I got 6,000 Facebook friends.</p>
<p>You got about that many real friends that you can count on and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Everything else doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean you don&rsquo;t be nice.</p>
<p>I mean, I have, there&rsquo;s acquaintance friends that I&rsquo;ll do anything for and they can come</p>
<p>to my house and stuff, but then there&rsquo;s the people that, you know, you know, like my cousins</p>
<p>who are like my brothers that, you know, at a moment&rsquo;s notice, you know, when, when my</p>
<p>uncle passed away at a young age, you know, who lived literally right down the street</p>
<p>from me and my cousin Chad and I got two boys, there&rsquo;s 14 of us, but there&rsquo;s only two boys.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s three of us together and we all grew up in the same neighborhood, same schools,</p>
<p>play football together, all that.</p>
<p>I said, if one of those, if rare Chad ever needs me, if something happens like when my</p>
<p>uncle died, it wasn&rsquo;t a, it wasn&rsquo;t an issue if I&rsquo;m coming home.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m booking the ticket and I don&rsquo;t give a shit what it costs because I will be</p>
<p>there to be there with you.</p>
<p>And then those two guys and my college roommate is another one that I&rsquo;m very, very close with,</p>
<p>you know, you know, if there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s, I have a handful of people that, you know, I</p>
<p>will drop literally everything.</p>
<p>Even if my wife would be pissed at me at times, she&rsquo;s like, seriously, I got to do it.</p>
<p>And now she knows, and it&rsquo;s the same thing with her.</p>
<p>I mean, she knows that there are certain people in her life that if they really need her and</p>
<p>she has to go, she would go and I would let her go.</p>
<p>So given all that, I&rsquo;m honored that you would come here and talk to me and take the time.</p>
<p>Dave was one of the best conversations I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty long one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably sets the record for the longest one.</p>
<p>So I, I mean, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m a loss of words.</p>
<p>One of my favorite conversations.</p>
