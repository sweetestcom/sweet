    <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Connie Loizos. And this is Alex Gove. And this is Strictly VC Download.</p>
<p>Hi, everyone. Happy holidays. As is always the case, we&rsquo;ve waited too late in the day to put</p>
<p>this podcast together. So we&rsquo;re just going to skip straight to two quick conversations that</p>
<p>we had this week, and we hope you will enjoy. One of the chats is with serial entrepreneur</p>
<p>and investor Fabrice Grinda, whose firm is currently the most active venture firm in the</p>
<p>world, somewhat shockingly. The other is with Bradley Tusk, a former political operative turned</p>
<p>venture capitalist and philanthropist who always has an interesting take on what&rsquo;s happening at</p>
<p>the intersection of regulation and technology. We will not be pumping out another podcast before</p>
<p>the end of this year. So we want to wish you all very happy holidays and to thank those of you who</p>
<p>take the time to listen to us blather on here most weeks. We really do appreciate you so much.</p>
<p>And now on to our first conversation with Fabrice Grinda. But first, a word from our sponsor.</p>

    >www.vauban.io</a> slash Strictly VC.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we had the chance to catch up with Fabrice Grinda, a serial entrepreneur who co-founded</p>
<p>the giant free classifieds site OLX, which is now owned by Process, though he&rsquo;s also well known for</p>
<p>giving up most of his earthly possessions a decade ago ahead of turning 40. As he told the New York</p>
<p>Times several years later, it was clarifying ditching his McLaren, selling his Bedford,</p>
<p>New York estate, and getting rid of his Manhattan Pied-a-terre to travel the world with just a</p>
<p>suitcase, staying with friends and families, focusing on what was meaningful. In fact,</p>
<p>he quickly came to realize that one of the things that mean the most to him is working with</p>
<p>startups. So soon after, he created FJ Labs with fellow entrepreneur Jose Martin, and they&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>on a tear apparently ever since. Indeed, though FJ Labs debut fund was relatively small, it raised</p>
<p>$50 million in 2016 from a single limited partner. Grinda says that FJ Labs is now backed by a wide</p>
<p>array of investors and that it has invested in a stunning 900 companies around the world by writing</p>
<p>them checks of between $250,000 and $500,000, for a stake of typically 1% to 3% in each.</p>
<p>And yet, Grinda suggests the firm could pick up the pace in 2023, now that the market has cooled,</p>
<p>and founders are more interested in FJ Labs&rsquo; biggest promise to them, which is that it will</p>
<p>help them to secure follow-on funding, come hell or high water, through the firm&rsquo;s connections.</p>
<p>While that promise was probably less interesting in a world awash with capital,</p>
<p>it has likely become more compelling as investors pull back and founders find themselves facing</p>
<p>fewer options. In the meantime, the global view of Grinda, whose portfolio companies</p>
<p>are scattered around the globe, is useful to understand, so we asked him about a variety of</p>
<p>things. We talked, for example, about how FJ Labs avoids investing in nearly identical companies</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s investing in so many of them. He said that, in fact, his firm will invest in the same</p>
<p>idea in different geographies, but it will clear the decision with a founder first, to ensure there</p>
<p>are no problems down the road. He also said that FJ Labs won&rsquo;t avoid a crowded area of investment,</p>
<p>but that it will wait to pick which startup to choose. As he told me, the firm may not take a</p>
<p>call when a company is in the pre-seed or seed stage, or even A stage, if there are seven other</p>
<p>companies doing the same thing. He said, you know what, we&rsquo;re not comfortable making the bet now,</p>
<p>because if we make a bet now, it&rsquo;s our horse in the race forever. We also asked Grinda why it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>FJ Labs&rsquo; policy not to take board seats. After all, this year has seen a number of companies</p>
<p>flounder, at least in part because of the inexperience of its founders. And aren&rsquo;t VCs</p>
<p>supposed to keep founders on the straight and narrow? Here, Grinda said he thinks most people</p>
<p>are good-intentioned and trustworthy, so he doesn&rsquo;t really focus on protecting the downside.</p>
<p>He also said that having a board seat is of little help if a founder is providing information that is</p>
<p>just flat-out wrong. We also asked about valuations, fatality rates, and one hidden threat</p>
<p>to startups. On the valuation front, he said it is the season of extension rounds, that even with</p>
<p>substantial growth, startups are largely having to turn to inside investors to seal up rounds</p>
<p>that are flat. He also said to expect a wave of fatalities six to nine months from now,</p>
<p>when a lot of startups that raised during good times finally run out of money.</p>
<p>Last, we talked about a problem hiding in plain sight, which is credit lines. A lot of startups</p>
<p>turned to credit facilities extended by banks so that they could grow faster. Now, with interest</p>
<p>rates rising and banks feeling skittish, those credit facilities could turn deadly. Here is</p>
<p>Grinda with more. The issue is more the credit lines that you ‚Äì depending on the business you&rsquo;re in, you should totally use that, first of all. If you&rsquo;re a lender, for instance, you do factoring,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to be lending off balance sheet. That is not scalable, right? As you grow your</p>
<p>loan book, you would need infinite equity capital, which would delete you to zero.</p>
<p>So what usually happens if you&rsquo;re a lending business is first you land off balance sheet,</p>
<p>then you get some family offices, then you get some hedge funds, then eventually you get a bank line</p>
<p>of credit, and it gets cheaper and cheaper in scales. The issue is in a rising rate environment,</p>
<p>in an environment where the underlying credit scores, the models that you use are not as</p>
<p>successful as you think they are, those lines could get pulled and your business could be at risk.</p>
<p>So I think a lot of the fintech companies that are dependent on these credit lines</p>
<p>may see them pulled and may be at existential risk as a result. But it&rsquo;s not because they took on</p>
<p>more debt. It&rsquo;s more because I think the credit lines they use, the debt they use might be revoked.</p>
<p>Number two, inventory-based businesses, so the DTC type businesses, again, you don&rsquo;t want to be</p>
<p>using equity to buy inventory. You use credit, you use debt. And it makes sense, right? As long as</p>
<p>you have a viable business model, people will give you debt to finance your inventory. But again,</p>
<p>the cost of that debt is going up because the interest rates are going up. And because the</p>
<p>underwriters, the banks are becoming more careful, they may decrease your line, they may call it,</p>
<p>in which case your ability to grow is basically shrunken. So companies that depended on debts to</p>
<p>grow quickly, I think are going to be seeing themselves extremely constrained. So I think a</p>
<p>lot of the fintechs that depended on debt and a lot of the DTC businesses that depended on debt</p>
<p>are going to have a hard time on a go-forward basis, not because they took too much of that,</p>
<p>but just because the debt is now more expensive and less easily available.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s bad news for some startups, but Grindr will be ready for whatever comes next.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s feeling itinerant again, he told us yesterday, and he&rsquo;s recharging for the new year,</p>
<p>not by shedding his possessions this time around, but rather by taking a long,</p>
<p>cold walk to think about things, unencumbered by the tech in which he&rsquo;s immersed every day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m heading to the edge of Antarctica, and I&rsquo;m walking to the South Pole.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to take me weeks. I&rsquo;m pulling my food, my tent, my sleeping bag.</p>
<p>So why? Because I love flow states, because we live in a hyper-connected world where</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a real privilege to be in a position to not be checking emails, not be talking to anyone,</p>
<p>not be checking WhatsApp or news, and be alone with your thoughts. It&rsquo;s going to be meditative,</p>
<p>reflective, disconnected, in what I think is going to be a productive and beautiful way,</p>
<p>while being physically challenging.</p>
<p>And now our interview with Bradley Tusk, the CEO and co-founder of Tusk Ventures.</p>
<p>Bradley, we always love talking to you. Thanks for hopping on here this morning with us.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to talk about. You always make these annual predictions that I think are</p>
<p>interesting and oftentimes prove to be correct in retrospect. I just thought what&rsquo;s not on here</p>
<p>is anything about social media. And just because it&rsquo;s in the news right now, and I&rsquo;d written last</p>
<p>night about how Elon Musk had kicked some people off of Twitter, and actually some StrictlyVC</p>
<p>readers were a little irritated with me thinking that I&rsquo;m over-indexing on Musk lately. But of</p>
<p>course, it&rsquo;s hard as a journalist not to be following what happens on Twitter, which has</p>
<p>been this utility, this public forum for so long and now feels very different. But just wondering,</p>
<p>you use Twitter, although I don&rsquo;t think super heavily. Do you have any thoughts about what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening on that platform? Yeah, a few things. One is, I think what Musk did is consistent with</p>
<p>things that we&rsquo;re seeing across the cultural zeitgeist right now, which is now that we have</p>
<p>this world with 24-7 media coverage, social media activity, the people who really, really need</p>
<p>attention and can&rsquo;t get enough of it just have to keep doing more and more outrageous things to try</p>
<p>to get it. So we saw that with Donald Trump. We saw that with Kanye West. And I think the main</p>
<p>reason why Musk bought Twitter is so people will be talking about him just as we are right now.</p>
<p>So from that standpoint, I suspect he&rsquo;s achieved his goal. What worries me for him a little bit is</p>
<p>when you look at the market cap of Tesla, for example, it is significantly higher than</p>
<p>Toyota, Ford, General Motors, companies that sell a lot more cars, right? And look, Tesla makes a</p>
<p>great car and they&rsquo;re growing and it&rsquo;s okay to kind of lean into the future. But the differential</p>
<p>between what they probably should be valued at and what they are valued at is that Elon Musk</p>
<p>hype and pixie dust, right? He manages to create such an image of being so far in the future and</p>
<p>so much better than everyone else that really drives retail investment in the stock. And the</p>
<p>same thing with SpaceX, while that&rsquo;s still a private company, I saw a piece yesterday saying</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s now valued at $140 billion. There&rsquo;s no way SpaceX could be able to have revenue or very</p>
<p>little like at $140 billion. So his genius in some ways is that he manages to create this perception</p>
<p>that what he&rsquo;s doing is so innovative and so unique and that only he can do it, that it drives</p>
<p>tremendous amounts of value and investment towards his companies. I think he&rsquo;s taking a really big</p>
<p>risk with Twitter because every time he does something really high profile in public, he puts</p>
<p>that reputation on the line, right? And he&rsquo;s taken over Twitter. No one has really ever figured out</p>
<p>how to make it a successful business. And now it&rsquo;s on his hands. And so far, the ideas that he&rsquo;s put</p>
<p>out there don&rsquo;t sound that new or interesting to me, right? It feels like variations of things that</p>
<p>people have already done before in different ways. And so if he does not succeed with Twitter,</p>
<p>the question is, does it have a ripple effect to puncture the balloon for Tesla and SpaceX</p>
<p>and all those other projects? He may have paid $44 billion for Twitter, but ultimately this</p>
<p>could cost him $100 billion or more if there&rsquo;s a risk that Tesla and SpaceX and other companies</p>
<p>that he owns lose value because he&rsquo;s exposed to being a mere mortal. Do you see any opportunities</p>
<p>to come out of what&rsquo;s happening there? We covered on TechCrunch today a startup that was created by</p>
<p>some former Twitter employees that are addressing Black Twitter, which is a huge cultural phenomenon</p>
<p>that was very early on the platform on Twitter. Just wondering if VCs are saying, okay, this is</p>
<p>a little bit of a disaster here, but there are&hellip; Not really, because if that were the case,</p>
<p>then Truth Social should have really worked, right? Because there&rsquo;s unquestionably a huge</p>
<p>audience on Twitter of Trump supporters and very, very right-wing people. And in theory,</p>
<p>they should be able to take all of their business, move it to Trump&rsquo;s platform,</p>
<p>and it should be wildly succeeding, and it hasn&rsquo;t so far. So the notion of, oh,</p>
<p>if we just move this Black Twitter or journalism Twitter, whatever it is, onto another platform,</p>
<p>that will just pick up all the traffic and do well, that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case.</p>
<p>One, because there&rsquo;s fall off, but two, because there&rsquo;s just not a great revenue model for all</p>
<p>of this to begin with, right? And then to make matters worse for them, I still think that there</p>
<p>is a risk eventually that Section 230 of the Telecommunications Decency Act does get changed</p>
<p>or repealed. As others may know, 230 exempts platforms from liability from the content posted</p>
<p>by the user. So, Kanye, I could defame you on Twitter, you could sue me personally,</p>
<p>but you couldn&rsquo;t sue Twitter. And as a result, Twitter, Facebook, all the platforms,</p>
<p>their real economic incentive is to move towards negative and toxic content, because as much as</p>
<p>we hate it, that drives eyeballs, that drives clicks, and that&rsquo;s what drives advertising rates</p>
<p>and revenue. And so effectively, the lack of liability by the platforms is creating a world</p>
<p>where the internet has to be as toxic and awful as possible. And so if you were to repeal Section</p>
<p>230, it&rsquo;d be a lot like what happened with the tobacco companies in the 1980s, where all of a</p>
<p>sudden they were vulnerable to litigation, started receiving these multi, multi-billion dollar</p>
<p>judgments. And as a result, they felt real economic pain and had to finally get a hold</p>
<p>of content moderation, because it was costing them more money than otherwise. Right now,</p>
<p>Facebook will pay the little fines that it gets from the FCC, because ultimately they make so</p>
<p>much money driven by negative content, repealing Section 230 would change that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reminded that when we talked a year ago, you had talked about potentially working on a social</p>
<p>media platform for religion. Yeah, I did. It launched and failed spectacularly or quickly.</p>
<p>Spectacularly would mean that people even noticed it. We built the platform. It launched in January.</p>
<p>It was not nearly good enough. It got very little usership. We tried a few different pivots.</p>
<p>None of them worked, and I shut it down in June.</p>
<p>Radley, I understand your point about how Twitter and other social media platforms could face a lot</p>
<p>of penalties in the US, but there&rsquo;s also Europe, and it seems like Twitter is potentially running</p>
<p>afoul of some elements of the GDPR. To what extent do you follow what&rsquo;s going on in Europe and the</p>
<p>GDPR? I think the EU has really been a leader in big tech regulation. They are moving now</p>
<p>towards eliminating the liability protections for the platforms like Facebook. They&rsquo;ve already</p>
<p>enacted a national, continent-wide privacy framework known as GDPR. Their antitrust</p>
<p>efforts are a lot stronger. They&rsquo;ve really done a lot more to protect consumers,</p>
<p>and that has not happened in the US. Now, we do see in individual states efforts to do that.</p>
<p>California passed a law called the CCPA, and that does provide a privacy framework for California</p>
<p>residents specifically, but only for California residents. Other states, Texas and others,</p>
<p>are starting to take up the issue as well. We&rsquo;re seeing it piecemeal, but the reality is</p>
<p>this is a federal issue. It&rsquo;s something that the US government ought to get its act together</p>
<p>and work on. One final piece, which is we&rsquo;re in Internet 2.0 right now, and we still have all of</p>
<p>these problems of a completely toxic web and no privacy protections, and companies becoming way</p>
<p>too big with no real ability to break them up through antitrust laws. What happens when we get</p>
<p>to Web 3.0, right? It seems to me that every good thing about the Internet and every bad thing about</p>
<p>the Internet is going to be 10 times worse, and if we can&rsquo;t get the basic protections in place that</p>
<p>we should have had long ago for Web 2.0 or Internet 2.0, it&rsquo;s terrifying to think what Web 3.0 is</p>
<p>going to be like.</p>
<p>Speaking of what&rsquo;s coming down the pipe, you have a number of predictions for what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to happen next year on healthcare and the gig economy and fintech, but I was curious that</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t have anything on artificial intelligence and chat GPT, and I&rsquo;m wondering</p>
<p>how you see that impacting not only social media platforms, but also&hellip;</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>Yeah, everything.</p>
<p>Everything, right. So, a few things. So, one is I didn&rsquo;t include it almost deliberately because,</p>
<p>look, we should have had a basic GDPR-type framework in the US for 10 years now. We still</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have one. It&rsquo;s going to be a long time before there&rsquo;s any real attempt to regulate artificial</p>
<p>intelligence. So, if the predictions were policy battles in 2023, I don&rsquo;t think anyone&rsquo;s even going</p>
<p>to take it up. I wrote a paper back in January on how to regulate the metaverse in the sense of</p>
<p>trying to get a conversation started and to get regulators and legislators thinking about it.</p>
<p>I sent it around to all the mayors and governors and members of Congress that I know,</p>
<p>and people figured, hey, why don&rsquo;t you just bill on this thing? It&rsquo;ll get some attention for you.</p>
<p>And I got nowhere with it. It was way too complex. So, I think from a regulatory policy standpoint,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll see nothing around AI for at least the next year, if not the next couple of years.</p>
<p>At the same time, though, I think society will see a lot. I mean, I was joking around with my son,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s 13 last night, like, what percentage of his classmates are going to start submitting</p>
<p>their school papers just copied and pasted from chat GPT, right? College application essays.</p>
<p>When I was a senior in high school, I had, I guess, a legal side business where I was</p>
<p>getting money from people to write their college essays for them. I think I would</p>
<p>have been out of business right now because you don&rsquo;t need to pay someone like me anymore.</p>
<p>So, I think that you&rsquo;re going to see cultural impacts and changes, and then eventually that</p>
<p>leads to regulatory changes. But I think that given how complex this issue is,</p>
<p>and given how unsophisticated most regulators are, it&rsquo;s going to be a while.</p>
<p>I mean, on the one hand, I get it. Like, there needs to be more to regulate. But</p>
<p>obviously, Musk and Sam Altman, who I&rsquo;m interviewing in a couple of weeks,</p>
<p>have been talking about the need for this for a long time, and now it&rsquo;s suddenly very obvious.</p>
<p>All right. Also, it&rsquo;s very funny that you were writing essays as a high school senior. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so on brand. Exactly. It was entrepreneurial. It was a little bit on the edge. Hopefully,</p>
<p>it worked out for them. Although, one guy that I remember, like, a year or two ago,</p>
<p>I saw his name. I hadn&rsquo;t thought about him in 25 years because he went to prison. So,</p>
<p>whatever I did for him did not work. And also, our 15-year-old is very focused already on chat</p>
<p>GPT. He&rsquo;d heard about it. I was going to talk to him about it when he came home from school,</p>
<p>but I think on the day that it was released, like 10 days ago, he was talking about it,</p>
<p>and this week, it was helping him to understand some science concepts,</p>
<p>he said. So, hopefully, they&rsquo;re using it as a positive, too.</p>
<p>So, speaking of regulations, you obviously made an early fortune by advising Uber,</p>
<p>and you talk about this a little bit in your predictions, but the U.S. Department of Labor,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a proposal that could upend rules for gig workers, lower the bar for classifying</p>
<p>employees as contractors. What do you think some of the ripple effects would be if this is enacted?</p>
<p>Yeah. So, look, I think that just to give a little context here, President Biden was</p>
<p>strongly supported by organized labor in 2020. He&rsquo;s been a union politician his whole career.</p>
<p>The opportunity to organize the gig economy is really the biggest thing the private sector labor</p>
<p>has had in decades. And so, as we&rsquo;ve seen with AB5 and everything else, the unions have gone</p>
<p>after this issue over and over again, but they&rsquo;ve done it at a state level. With Biden in office,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re now proposing a rule for the Department of Labor that would effectively make it much</p>
<p>easier to classify Uber drivers, DoorDash delivery people, Instacart shoppers, whatever it is,</p>
<p>as full-time employees as opposed to independent contractors. The states would still have to reach</p>
<p>those individual determinations as well, but the federal rule will make it a lot easier for</p>
<p>blue states to classify the Ubers of the world as W-2 companies, and it&rsquo;d be harder for Uber</p>
<p>to stop it. So, if that were to all take place, and I think it probably will, what you&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>at is revival of state legislation and action on this issue. So, this was one of the most prominent</p>
<p>tech issues from, say, 2016 to 2019, culminating in AB5, which was a law passed in Sacramento</p>
<p>that basically said everyone in the sharing economy is now a full-time employee. That was</p>
<p>done because it has to organize labor. There was then Prop 22, which was a ballot referendum</p>
<p>sponsored by Uber and Lyft and all the companies that then overturned AB5, and then the issue went</p>
<p>away for two reasons. One, COVID came and it just got put on the back burner, and two, because the</p>
<p>voters responded so significantly from voting for Prop 22 and overturning AB5, it sent a message to</p>
<p>politicians all over the country that, look, voters don&rsquo;t care that much about this issue,</p>
<p>and to the extent that they do, they don&rsquo;t want you making their Uber ride more expensive, right?</p>
<p>So, as a result, politicians backed off of this, and we haven&rsquo;t seen that much legislative activity</p>
<p>in the past few years. By Biden proposing this rule, he re-engages all of it again.</p>
<p>Right. Also, obviously, the biggest story of the last month is FTX&rsquo;s blow-up. You&rsquo;ve done a little</p>
<p>bit of crypto investing, I think. People have been talking about regulation for so long. This</p>
<p>seems like it&rsquo;s the moment. What do you anticipate happening here?</p>
<p>Yeah. So, we&rsquo;re on Coinbase, we&rsquo;re on Circle. We&rsquo;ve done some crypto investment,</p>
<p>not heavily in crypto, but definitely have some exposure to it. So, when the FTX blow-up started</p>
<p>happening, my take was, okay, this is what&rsquo;s going to really lead to a lot of very harsh</p>
<p>crypto regulation that would be bad for the sector, because Gary Gensler, who&rsquo;s the head of</p>
<p>the SEC, has been pushing for this for a long time. It hasn&rsquo;t happened yet, because crypto</p>
<p>is very popular among a lot of actual real people, but FTX would give him the cover to move very</p>
<p>aggressively against the industry as a whole. In a weird way, since then, as the story gets</p>
<p>crazier and crazier, and just more and more like Sam Beckman Freed was just sort of a criminal</p>
<p>mastermind who was defrauding people out of tens of billions of dollars and not really something</p>
<p>specifically related to crypto, per se, it actually shifts the argument again from, hey,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got to fix this whole industry, it&rsquo;s out of control, to this person was out of control, and I</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s going to go to jail for 20 years or something like that. But it&rsquo;s almost gotten so</p>
<p>extreme that it&rsquo;s actually helping again. But look, a lot of the legitimate platforms in crypto,</p>
<p>the Coinbases of the world, the Paxos of the world, and whatever role they play,</p>
<p>they want smart regulation that tells them what the rules are. Here&rsquo;s what you can do,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what you can&rsquo;t do. And there&rsquo;s really just been an absence of any type of guidance at all</p>
<p>by the SEC. That&rsquo;s why you saw legislation introduced in the US Senate in 2022,</p>
<p>that was bipartisan, Loomis in Wyoming, and Gillibrand in New York, that would have moved</p>
<p>jurisdiction of regulating crypto to the CFTC, which everyone felt like would be a more friendly</p>
<p>regulator. So I think one way or another, we&rsquo;re going to see more crypto regulation coming in the</p>
<p>next 12 months. I also think that New York has something called a BitLicense, which all the</p>
<p>platforms hate, but you have to have it in order to do trading in New York. There&rsquo;s a lot of rumors</p>
<p>that California is going to move towards a similar process, and the New York BitLicense</p>
<p>needs a lot of reform. So hopefully whatever California does will be a better system than</p>
<p>New York&rsquo;s. But I think you&rsquo;re going to start to see regulation both at the state level and</p>
<p>more at the federal level too. Just as a VC, how sympathetic or not are you to FTX investors? On</p>
<p>the one hand, it seems really egregious that there was not a board there. On the other hand,</p>
<p>this guy was lying through his teeth. Although I would think with a financial business,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have some way of verifying that the metrics you&rsquo;re being given were not made of thin air.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think it was just reflective of the moment that we were in, in mid-2020</p>
<p>till the end of 2021, where it was just insane. And founders had all of the leverage. I would</p>
<p>be on calls in crypto or any other sector, quite frankly, where I&rsquo;d be on a first-time call with</p>
<p>a founder. And then I&rsquo;d be told, if you&rsquo;re interested in this deal, you have to submit</p>
<p>a term sheet today. It&rsquo;s like, what? I haven&rsquo;t even looked at the data yet. I don&rsquo;t know whether</p>
<p>I want to invest in this company. But a lot of VCs felt a lot of pressure and they&rsquo;ve deployed</p>
<p>a lot of capital. There&rsquo;s a lot of FOMO in this industry. And people, even funds as legendary</p>
<p>Sequoia, threw money at things that clearly, had they done more diligence, might have shown</p>
<p>otherwise. And so look, I don&rsquo;t feel that much sympathy because we&rsquo;re professional investors.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re supposed to be able to have the discipline to not deploy capital unless we&rsquo;ve done our</p>
<p>research and done our diligence. Now look, I understand that I&rsquo;ve got a little bit of unfair</p>
<p>advantage because in my tiny little niche of venture capital, at the intersection of technology</p>
<p>and regulation, we&rsquo;re the only ones that do it. So I&rsquo;ve got a monopoly, which gives us a little</p>
<p>more leverage and a little more deal flow. But with that said, we were definitely in a period</p>
<p>of rational exuberance, as Al Greenspan would have put it. And there was a lot of substandard</p>
<p>behavior by VCs in really not doing the work they needed to do to protect their LPs, and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>paying the price for it.</p>
<p>Briley, also, just before we let you go, I wanted to ask,</p>
<p>what types of clients are you seeing right now that you didn&rsquo;t before? What&rsquo;s changing</p>
<p>on a policy level that&rsquo;s causing people to come reach out to you?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the first thing is climate. So one of the real accomplishments of the</p>
<p>Biden administration, in my view, is that they were able to secure hundreds of billions of</p>
<p>dollars in new funding for climate innovation, climate tech, that was both in the federal</p>
<p>infrastructure bill that passed last year, and then it was the big component of the Inflation</p>
<p>Reduction Act as well, even though climate has nothing to do with inflation. And what that does</p>
<p>is it provides a lot of money and a lot of certainty because it&rsquo;s over a 10-year period</p>
<p>that this sector will now really be able to develop, and not just on the dime of VCs or</p>
<p>research institutions, but on the federal government itself. And that should really</p>
<p>propel the industry forward. It&rsquo;s still very complicated because, look, if you invest in a</p>
<p>CPG product, you can analyze it fairly simply, right? Is the product good enough? Is the</p>
<p>founder good enough? Is the marketing good enough? Is this going to work or not? And you can make a</p>
<p>bet and get an answer relatively quickly. With climate, it&rsquo;s a much deeper technical component,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not quite as easy to evaluate it, but I think you&rsquo;re going to see a lot more activity.</p>
<p>And look, I mean, if you just look at the failure of the COP26 conference in Ethiopia,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re never going to solve climate change through conservation, through human beings</p>
<p>changing their behavior to emit less. The only way we&rsquo;re going to solve it is through technology.</p>
<p>And to me, we&rsquo;re going to reach that one and a half to two degrees Celsius increase.</p>
<p>But if carbon capture really could work and we could remove carbon from the atmosphere and store</p>
<p>it deep underground, that could solve the entire problem. And so I think that this is the moment</p>
<p>where the tech sector can really step up and literally save the planet.</p>
<p>Bradley, one of your predictions has to do with drugs and the Biden administration potentially</p>
<p>removing cannabis as a schedule one drug, which you point out is why most cannabis-related</p>
<p>business activities are illegal. Once this changes, you speculate that perhaps consumer</p>
<p>giants like Unilever or Kraft or Philip Morris could jump into the space. Is that realistic</p>
<p>to think that these big brands would move into that area?</p>
<p>Look, big brands are in alcohol all of the time. Cannabis, many people would argue,</p>
<p>is a less harmful substance than alcohol. We&rsquo;ve got this real disconnect between the</p>
<p>states and the federal government where cannabis is legal recreationally and medicinally. More</p>
<p>than half the states, probably closer to two-thirds at this point, and yet it&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>schedule one at the DEA. What that means is the DEA has a list of categories that they put drugs</p>
<p>into and the penalties associated with them. And schedule one is the harshest, and things</p>
<p>like heroin and meth and cocaine are on there. But cannabis is on there too, which really doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make a lot of sense, especially as states keep legalizing it entirely. And so President Biden</p>
<p>said, let&rsquo;s remove this from schedule one. Once that happens, then all of a sudden all</p>
<p>kinds of interstate commerce that so far has not been allowed will open up. So you&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>able to have real banking, trucking of flour across state lines, advertising. So all of the</p>
<p>things that a normal, really big company, a Kraft, a Unilever, an Anheuser-Busch, a Philip Morris</p>
<p>might engage in, they can&rsquo;t really do under the current system. But once the federal restrictions</p>
<p>are loosened, then all of a sudden it opens up for them. And one reason why we&rsquo;ve never made</p>
<p>a cannabis investment is every time that we see a company in it, I ask the same question, which is,</p>
<p>how are they going to compete with Unilever? Why would Unilever choose to buy them as opposed to</p>
<p>just burying them? And most of the time, the answer is they can&rsquo;t. And so you&rsquo;re really just</p>
<p>racing against the clock to hope that the federal government doesn&rsquo;t actually do the right thing,</p>
<p>and that keeps the big players out of the market. But I think that&rsquo;s changing. I think once cannabis</p>
<p>goes off schedule one, I don&rsquo;t know if it happens in six months or in two years, but look, when</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s money to be made and it&rsquo;s legal, big companies get into the game. I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen here. And I think a lot of cannabis startups that were highly valued or</p>
<p>overvalued or traded at really high multiples on the Canadian stock exchange are going to feel a</p>
<p>lot of pain. One topic that you also tackle is healthcare, specifically digital healthcare,</p>
<p>and also the access or lack of access that women have to abortion drugs. And I understand you have</p>
<p>an investment in the space, Mayday Health. Could you tell us a little bit about it?</p>
<p>Yeah. So it&rsquo;s a nonprofit. It&rsquo;s not actually an investment. We&rsquo;ve looked at companies that</p>
<p>do tell abortion. And the reason we were never able to move towards an investment, even though</p>
<p>we like the idea and the societal benefit of it, is you want to invest in things that people are</p>
<p>using all the time, right? DoorDash or Uber or Facebook, whatever it is. Women are half the</p>
<p>population. Some subset of women do have an abortion. It&rsquo;s really important that they have</p>
<p>the right to do so, but they typically have it if they do once or twice in their lives.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a repeat product. So as an investment, it never really made sense to us. But when Amy</p>
<p>Coney Bryant was confirmed to the Supreme Court, even before the Dobbs decision was handed down,</p>
<p>it seemed pretty clear to me that Roe was going to be overturned. And the question I started to</p>
<p>ask myself is, why is this different than all of the other telemedicine stuff that we invest in,</p>
<p>in terms of how a doctor and a patient could interact? So for example, Roman, which is a</p>
<p>company that we&rsquo;re investors in, they provide different types of medication to men, Viagra</p>
<p>being the primary one. And basically, what does it entail? It&rsquo;s a conversation through some</p>
<p>technological device between a patient and a doctor or medical professional, and then it is</p>
<p>medication being sent in the mail to somebody. And I was thinking, how could that really be stopped</p>
<p>if you tried to do that around abortion? When they did the Silk Road for the dark web, the main</p>
<p>learning they took away from it was, you can mail people MDMA in the US mail and regular white</p>
<p>envelopes all day long and never get caught. It&rsquo;s basically impossible. So my thought was, yeah,</p>
<p>it might not be legal in Alabama, in Utah, in Tennessee, whatever it is, but they can&rsquo;t monitor</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s keystrokes, and they can&rsquo;t monitor everything in the US mail. And as a result,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t there still a way to get women access to abortion pills? And so along with some other</p>
<p>people in tech and VC space, we were able to create a nonprofit called Mayday Health.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an educational nonprofit that shows women in red states, how they can continue getting</p>
<p>action to abortion medication. We show them where the different providers are from telemedicine. We</p>
<p>show them how to set up mail forwarding so that the providers can send it to a place where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still legal in another blue state. And then the mail gets forwarded to the home of the woman in</p>
<p>the red state. We show them what their legal options and resources could be. And it&rsquo;s worked</p>
<p>really well. Traffic has been incredibly high. And it&rsquo;s working because now you&rsquo;re seeing states like</p>
<p>South Carolina, Texas start proposing explicit bans on importation of abortion pills in that state.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a really open question because the FDA has said, no, we have approved these. These are</p>
<p>federally approved drugs. You can&rsquo;t tell people that they can&rsquo;t take them. The states are saying</p>
<p>that this will eventually get resolved in the courts like everything does. And I have to assume</p>
<p>that if the makeup of the court stays the same, we&rsquo;ll probably lose eventually, but that could</p>
<p>be five years from now. And so if between now and then we can help women get access to the</p>
<p>medication they need, we should do so. And when you look at the other alternatives, like bringing</p>
<p>women from a red state to a blue state to get an abortion, that&rsquo;s not scalable. The only thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really scalable is technology. I have a 16 year old daughter. If we lived in a red state and</p>
<p>she got pregnant, she couldn&rsquo;t tell us. She would not have the wherewithal to figure out how to get</p>
<p>to a blue state to get an abortion, even if Planned Parenthood was facilitating it. What she knows how</p>
<p>to do, find things on the internet and buy things on the internet. And she would find Mayday and</p>
<p>through that she would find the different providers and she would be able to get it.</p>
<p>And so if we want to reach younger women and really the most vulnerable women, this is the</p>
<p>best way to do so. It&rsquo;s the only scalable way to do so. They&rsquo;ll probably be in a little bit of</p>
<p>legal limbo. We&rsquo;re working in 2023 to pass laws in the blue states to provide explicit protection</p>
<p>to medical providers who engage in this so that they can&rsquo;t be sued civilly or prosecuted criminally</p>
<p>by the Southern states that are opposing abortion. It&rsquo;s all still a little up in the air,</p>
<p>but to me, this is one of the best uses of technology to preserve people&rsquo;s rights and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re excited to do so. Bradley, speaking of your philanthropic work, you also, I noticed today,</p>
<p>published something on Fast Company about how effective altruism can move past Sam Bankman</p>
<p>Freed. Can you lay out for listeners who may not know what is effective altruism and what is your</p>
<p>proposal here? So effective altruism is really just the concept of how do we get the maximum</p>
<p>value, the maximum ROI for every penny donated to charity? I certainly love the arts. Is it as</p>
<p>important as a child in Africa getting malaria pills or a mosquito net so they don&rsquo;t die from</p>
<p>it? No, of course it isn&rsquo;t right. So effective altruism says, where can we do the greatest</p>
<p>amount of good with the money that we have? It&rsquo;s been a very popular concept, especially in Silicon</p>
<p>Valley and in the tech community. Sam Bankman Freed was a fan of effective altruism and started</p>
<p>pledging tremendous amounts of money to the movement that got him a lot of notoriety,</p>
<p>gave him a lot of influence in it. And then of course, like everything with him, it was nonsense.</p>
<p>And that gives the effective altruism movement a black eye. My proposal is as we think about how</p>
<p>to shift it from the SBF hangover into something else, one thing we&rsquo;re doing out of my foundation</p>
<p>on hunger is we fund and run bills in states to pass laws that do things like mandate universal</p>
<p>school meals, breakfast after the bowel, expanded SNAP for seniors. And so far we&rsquo;ve run bills in</p>
<p>24 states. We&rsquo;ve passed the legislation in 19 of them, 12 million more people as a result now have</p>
<p>access to food on a regular basis. And $4 million approximately of my money in these campaigns has</p>
<p>unlocked about a billion and a half in new government money for hunger programs. That&rsquo;s a 400x return.</p>
<p>And so my argument is nothing can scale like government. I was Mike Bloomberg&rsquo;s campaign</p>
<p>manager when he ran for mayor. His thesis was, yes, I&rsquo;m an incredibly wealthy person and I do</p>
<p>plan to give all the money away, but it&rsquo;s still really a pittance compared to what I could do if</p>
<p>I run the city of New York. And he was absolutely right. And the societal impact that Mike had</p>
<p>as mayor was exponentially greater than what he could have ever had as a philanthropist.</p>
<p>And so to me, if you really want to maximize philanthropic dollars, find issues like hunger</p>
<p>where for not a lot of money, you can start passing bills in states, in cities that really</p>
<p>have widespread returns. I think about if I&rsquo;d given that $4 million instead to a food bank,</p>
<p>it would help a lot of people. There&rsquo;d be absolutely nothing wrong with it, but it wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be 12 million people. It wouldn&rsquo;t even be 1.2 million people, right? It would be a fraction</p>
<p>of that. And so to me, if the point of effect of altruism is to generate the most good with</p>
<p>the resources you have, one thing they have not done yet is look at how do we leverage government?</p>
<p>How do we leverage legislation to do that? As my proposal is that the movement start</p>
<p>looking at that approach.</p>
<p>Bradley, you actually had introduced me to Vivek Ramaswamy years ago, the founder of Roivin. And</p>
<p>I saw that he moved recently back home to, well, close to his home. I think he grew up in Cincinnati</p>
<p>and he just moved to Dublin, which is a suburb outside of Columbus. And it sounds like he is</p>
<p>positioning himself to run for political office. Obviously, J.D. Vance is now Senator-elect</p>
<p>in Ohio. I think I&rsquo;ve asked you this before, but I do wonder, do you have any political aspirations?</p>
<p>No. I think I&rsquo;d be a good elected official in the sense that I would be</p>
<p>good at doing the job. When I was the deputy governor of Illinois, my boss,</p>
<p>the guy that most people have heard of because he went to jail, Rob Blagojevich,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t come to the office for a month at a clip. So I did get to run the state of Illinois,</p>
<p>the budget, the operations, legislation, the policy, the communications,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not particularly good looking. I&rsquo;m not particularly charismatic.</p>
<p>And also, look, people who run for office really, really, really need the validation</p>
<p>and affirmation that comes with it. And oftentimes they can&rsquo;t achieve it in other ways.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re willing to do whatever it takes. And look, running for office is hard. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>demeaning. It&rsquo;s brutal in many ways, but this is the way that they can get the psychological</p>
<p>benefit they need. I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to have success in other areas. So I get the affirmation</p>
<p>that I need. I get the validation that I need. I don&rsquo;t have to become an elected official to do it.</p>
<p>Look, if there was ever another 9-11 type situation and there was a need for a Mike</p>
<p>Bloomberg type to run and that person could win because of the extreme situation, might that</p>
