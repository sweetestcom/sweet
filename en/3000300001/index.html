    <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
<p>PRABHAKAR RAGHAVAN: Hello, everyone.</p>
<p>Bonjour.</p>
<p>Welcome.</p>
<p>Before we start, I&rsquo;d like to join</p>
<p>[? Mack ?] in acknowledging the tragic loss of life</p>
<p>and the widespread destruction from the earthquakes in Turkey</p>
<p>and Syria.</p>
<p>Our hearts are with the people there.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;re here in France, the birthplace</p>
<p>of seven giants of science and mathematics&ndash;</p>
<p>Blaise Pascal, Pierre de Fermat, Joseph Fourier,</p>
<p>to name just a few on whose shoulders computer scientists</p>
<p>stand today.</p>
<p>And for those on the livestream, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>coming to you from Google Paris, home of one of our premier AI</p>
<p>research centers and less than 5 kilometers</p>
<p>from the final resting place of Pascal,</p>
<p>my favorite mathematician.</p>
<p>What a fitting setting to talk about the next frontier</p>
<p>for our information products and how AI is powering the future.</p>
<p>The very first founder&rsquo;s letter said that our goal at Google</p>
<p>is to &ldquo;significantly improve the lives of as many people as</p>
<p>possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why our products have a singular focus,</p>
<p>to be helpful to you in moments big and small.</p>
<p>Think about Google Search, which would</p>
<p>celebrate its 25th birthday today, this year.</p>
<p>Search was built in breakthroughs</p>
<p>in language understanding.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we can take a complex, conversational query,</p>
<p>like delicious-looking, flaky French pastry</p>
<p>in the shape of a heart, and help you identify exactly</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>But we didn&rsquo;t stop there.</p>
<p>Through our ongoing investments in AI,</p>
<p>we can now understand information in its many forms,</p>
<p>from language to images and videos, even the real world.</p>
<p>With this deeper understanding, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>moving beyond the traditional notion of search</p>
<p>to help you make sense of information in new ways.</p>
<p>So now you can simply take a picture with Lens</p>
<p>to instantly learn that heart-shaped pastry is</p>
<p>a palmier cookie.</p>
<p>But advancements in AI are also why</p>
<p>if you need to fix your bike chain,</p>
<p>you can get directed to the exact point in a video that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>relevant to you, like when they&rsquo;re showing you</p>
<p>how to put the chain back on.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re shopping for a new accent chair,</p>
<p>you can see it from all angles right on Search in 3D</p>
<p>and place it in your living room with AR, augmented reality,</p>
<p>to see how it looks.</p>
<p>Or if you pop out of the metro in an unfamiliar city.</p>
<p>you can find arrows overlaid in Google Maps on the real world,</p>
<p>pointing you to walk in the right direction.</p>
<p>All these examples are a far cry from the early days of Search.</p>
<p>But, as we always say, Search will never be a solved problem.</p>
<p>Although we are almost 25 years in,</p>
<p>Search is still our biggest moonshot.</p>
<p>The thing is, that moon keeps moving.</p>
<p>The perfect search remains elusive</p>
<p>because two things are constantly changing, first,</p>
<p>how people expect to engage with information naturally</p>
<p>and intuitively, and second, how technology</p>
<p>can empower that experience.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re creating new Search experience</p>
<p>that work more like our minds, that reflect how we as people</p>
<p>naturally make sense of the world.</p>
<p>As we enter this new era of Search,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to understand information,</p>
<p>no matter what language it originated in.</p>
<p>Search anyway and anywhere, be it</p>
<p>on your screen or to explore the real world.</p>
<p>And express yourself and unlock your creativity in new ways.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with understanding information.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen time and time again that access to information</p>
<p>empowers people.</p>
<p>But for centuries, information was largely</p>
<p>confined to the language it was created or spoken in</p>
<p>and only accessible to people who understand that language.</p>
<p>With Google Translate, we can break down</p>
<p>language barriers and unlock information, regardless</p>
<p>of the language of its origin.</p>
<p>Over a billion people around the world</p>
<p>today use Translate across 133 languages</p>
<p>to understand conversations, online information,</p>
<p>and the real world.</p>
<p>For example, translate has been a lifeline</p>
<p>to help those displaced from Ukraine</p>
<p>adjust to daily life in new countries.</p>
<p>In the war&rsquo;s early days, Ukrainian Google Translate</p>
<p>queries grew in Polish, German, and other European languages</p>
<p>as Ukrainians seeking refuge turned to it</p>
<p>for critical information in their language.</p>
<p>We recently added 33 new languages</p>
<p>to Translate&rsquo;s offline mode, including Corsican, Latin,</p>
<p>and Yiddish, to name just a few.</p>
<p>So even if you&rsquo;re somewhere without access to the internet,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get the translation help you need.</p>
<p>And soon it will bring you a richer, more intuitive way</p>
<p>to translate words that have multiple meanings</p>
<p>and translations.</p>
<p>So whether you&rsquo;re trying to buy a new novel</p>
<p>or celebrate a novel idea, you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have the context you need to use the right turn of phrase.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll begin rolling this out in several languages in the coming</p>
<p>weeks.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s still more we can do to bridge language divides.</p>
<p>To bring the power of translate to even more languages,</p>
<p>we use zero-shot machine translation, an advanced AI</p>
<p>technique that learns to translate into another language</p>
<p>without ever seeing translation pairs.</p>
<p>Thanks to zero-shot machine translation,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve added two dozen new languages</p>
<p>to Translate this past year.</p>
<p>In total, over 300 million people</p>
<p>speak these newly added languages.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s roughly the equivalent of bringing translation</p>
<p>to the entire United States.</p>
<p>While language is at the heart of how we communicate</p>
<p>as people, another important way we make sense of information</p>
<p>is visually.</p>
<p>As we are fond of saying, your camera is the next keyboard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why back in 2017, we redefined</p>
<p>what it means to search by introducing Lens</p>
<p>so you can search what you see with your camera or photos.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve since brought Lens directly to the Search Bar.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve continued to bring you new capabilities,</p>
<p>like shopping within an image and step-by-step homework help.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to announce that we&rsquo;ve just</p>
<p>reached a major new milestone.</p>
<p>People now use Lens more than 10 billion times a month.</p>
<p>This signals that visual search has moved from a novelty</p>
<p>to reality.</p>
<p>And as we predicted, the age of visual search is here.</p>
<p>In the context of translation, understanding isn&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>about the languages we use.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also about the visuals we see.</p>
<p>Often it&rsquo;s the words with context,</p>
<p>like background images, that create meaning.</p>
<p>And so in Lens, a new advancement</p>
<p>helps you translate the whole picture, not just</p>
<p>the text in it.</p>
<p>Before, when translating text in an image,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d block part of the background.</p>
<p>Now, instead of covering the text,</p>
<p>we erase it, recreate the pixels underneath</p>
<p>with an AI-generated background, and then overlay</p>
<p>the translated text back on top of the image,</p>
<p>all as if it was part of the original picture.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to share that this is now rolling out globally</p>
<p>on Android mobile.</p>
<p>So you can use Lens to start translating text into context.</p>
<p>As you can see with Lens, we want</p>
<p>to connect you to the world&rsquo;s information one</p>
<p>visual at a time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re continuing to build upon these capabilities.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll now turn to Liz to share more.</p>
<p>Liz?</p>
<p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
<p>LIZ REID: Thanks, Prabhakar.</p>
<p>You can already use Lens to search</p>
<p>from your camera or photos right from the Search Bar.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re introducing a major update</p>
<p>to help you search what&rsquo;s on your mobile screen.</p>
<p>In the coming months, you&rsquo;ll be able to use</p>
<p>Lens to search what you see in photos or videos</p>
<p>across the websites and apps you know and love on Android.</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you get a message from your friend who</p>
<p>sent a video exploring Paris.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d like to learn what the landmark is</p>
<p>that you see in the video.</p>
<p>So you long press the power button on your phone,</p>
<p>bring up Google Assistant, and tap Search Screen.</p>
<p>Assistant connects you to Lens, which identifies it</p>
<p>as Luxembourg Palace.</p>
<p>And you can tap to learn more.</p>
<p>Pretty awesome, huh?</p>
<p>Think about it like this.</p>
<p>With Lens, if you can see it, you can search it.</p>
<p>As Prabhakar touched upon, sometimes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the combination of words and images</p>
<p>that communicate meaning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why last year we introduced Multisearch in Lens.</p>
<p>With Multisearch, you can search with a picture and a text</p>
<p>together, opening up entirely new ways to express yourself.</p>
<p>Say you see a stylish chair but you want it</p>
<p>in a more muted color to match your style.</p>
<p>You can use Multisearch to find it</p>
<p>in beige or another color of yours.</p>
<p>Or you spot a floral pattern shirt</p>
<p>but you want in it bleu rouge instead.</p>
<p>You can use Multisearch for that, too.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how that works with a live demo.</p>
<p>We are missing the&ndash;</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re missing the phone.</p>
<p>[LAUGHS] We&rsquo;ll have to&ndash;</p>
<p>we have no&ndash; we&rsquo;ll move on.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t find the phone.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do one later in the special Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>OK, so what you can do is you can spot a cool pattern</p>
<p>on the notebook, but then you can swipe up to see the text</p>
<p>and be able to search on the Search Box,</p>
<p>letting you find something like a rock</p>
<p>if you just typed in [INAUDIBLE]..</p>
<p>Or you can find wallpaper, similar.</p>
<p>This unique ability allows us to mix modalities,</p>
<p>like images and texts.</p>
<p>And it opens up a whole world of possibilities.</p>
<p>And you can imagine a future where even more modalities</p>
<p>are at play.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to share that Multisearch is now officially</p>
<p>live globally on mobile.</p>
<p>And that means Multisearch is now</p>
<p>available in over 70 languages that Lens</p>
<p>is in around the world.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve taken Multisearch a step further</p>
<p>by adding the ability to search locally on mobile in the US.</p>
<p>You can take a picture or screenshot of a food dish</p>
<p>or item and add Near Me to find where</p>
<p>to get it nearby from the millions of businesses</p>
<p>on Google.</p>
<p>In the next few months, we&rsquo;ll bring Multisearch Near Me</p>
<p>to all the languages and countries</p>
<p>for which Lens is available to.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll be able to use Near Me if you</p>
<p>want to support a neighborhood business</p>
<p>or if you just need to pick something up right away.</p>
<p>There are also times when you&rsquo;re already searching</p>
<p>and you find something that just catches your eye</p>
<p>and it inspires you.</p>
<p>So in the next few months, you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be able to use Multisearch globally</p>
<p>for any image you see on the Search results page on mobile.</p>
<p>Once you start using Multisearch,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s striking how natural.</p>
<p>It feels to be able to use multiple senses to search.</p>
<p>I hope you give it a try.</p>
<p>And with that, back to Prabhakar.</p>
<p>[APPLAUSE]</p>
<p>PRABHAKAR RAGHAVAN: Thanks, Liz.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll have to figure out who stole your phone.</p>
<p>So far today, we&rsquo;ve talked about how</p>
<p>AI is helping us more deeply understand</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s information so we can help</p>
<p>you access it more naturally.</p>
<p>But we only scratched the surface</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s possible with AI.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve long been pioneers in this space,</p>
<p>not just in our research, but also</p>
<p>in how we bring those breakthroughs</p>
<p>to the world and our products in a responsible way.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve made significant contributions</p>
<p>to the scientific community, like developing</p>
<p>the Transformer, which set the stage for much</p>
<p>of the generative AI activity we see today.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re committed to continuing</p>
<p>to bring these technologies to the world in a responsible way</p>
<p>that benefits everyone.</p>
<p>This is the journey we&rsquo;ve been on with large language</p>
<p>models, which can make engaging with technology</p>
<p>more natural and conversational.</p>
<p>Back at I/O in 2021, we unveiled our LaMDA AI model,</p>
<p>a breakthrough in conversational technology.</p>
<p>Next, we&rsquo;re bringing LaMDA to an experimental conversational AI</p>
<p>service, which we fondly call Bard.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to interact with Bard to explore complex topics,</p>
<p>collaborate in real time, and get creative new ideas.</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re in the market for a new car, one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good fit for your family.</p>
<p>Bard can help you think through different angles to consider,</p>
<p>from budget to safety and more, and simplify and make</p>
<p>sense of them.</p>
<p>Bard&rsquo;s suggestion to consider fuel type</p>
<p>might spark your curiosity.</p>
<p>So you can ask it to explain the pros</p>
<p>and cons of buying an electric car and get helpful insights.</p>
<p>We all know that once you buy a new car,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have to plan a road trip.</p>
<p>Bard can help you plan your road trip</p>
<p>so you can take your new car out for a spin.</p>
<p>You might ask Bard to help you find</p>
<p>scenic routes, interesting places to stop along the way,</p>
<p>and fun things to do when you and your family</p>
<p>get to your destination.</p>
<p>Bard seeks to combine the breadth of the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>knowledge with the power, intelligence, and creativity</p>
<p>of large language models.</p>
<p>It draws on information to the web</p>
<p>to provide fresh, high-quality responses.</p>
<p>We are releasing Bard initially with our lightweight model</p>
<p>version of LaMDA.</p>
<p>This much smaller model needs significantly less computing</p>
<p>power, which means we&rsquo;ll be able to scale it to more users</p>
<p>and get more feedback.</p>
<p>We just took our next big step by opening Bard up</p>
<p>to trusted testers this week.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll continue to use feedback from internal and external</p>
<p>testing to make sure it meets the high bar, our high bar</p>
<p>for quality, safety, and groundedness</p>
<p>before we launch it more broadly.</p>
<p>Human curiosity is endless.</p>
<p>And for many years, we&rsquo;ve helped remove roadblocks</p>
<p>to information so you can follow your curiosity wherever</p>
<p>it takes you, from learning more about a topic to understanding</p>
<p>a variety of viewpoints.</p>
<p>People often turn to Google for quick, factual answers,</p>
<p>like what is a constellation?</p>
<p>Already today, we give you fast answers</p>
<p>for straightforward queries like this.</p>
<p>But for many questions, there&rsquo;s no one right answer,</p>
<p>what we call NORA queries, questions like,</p>
<p>what are the best constellations to look for when stargazing?</p>
<p>For questions like those, you probably</p>
<p>want to explore a diverse range of opinions or perspectives</p>
<p>and be connected to the expansive wisdom of the web.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re bringing the magic of generative AI</p>
<p>directly to your search results.</p>
<p>So soon, if you ask, what are the best constellations</p>
<p>to look for when stargazing, new generative</p>
<p>AI features will help us organize</p>
<p>complex information in multiple viewpoints</p>
<p>right in search results.</p>
<p>With this, you&rsquo;ll be able to quickly understand</p>
<p>the big picture and then go on to explore different angles.</p>
<p>So say this new information on constellations</p>
<p>piques your interest.</p>
<p>You can dig deeper, for instance,</p>
<p>to learn what time of year is best to see them and explore</p>
<p>further on the web.</p>
<p>Open access to information is core to our mission.</p>
<p>And we know people seek authentic voices</p>
<p>and diverse perspectives.</p>
<p>As we scale these new generative AI features, like this,</p>
<p>in our search results, we continue</p>
<p>to prioritize approaches that will</p>
<p>allow us to send valuable traffic</p>
<p>to a wide range of creators and support a healthy, open web.</p>
<p>In fact, we&rsquo;ve sent more traffic to the web every year</p>
<p>each year than the year prior.</p>
<p>The potential for generative AI goes</p>
<p>far beyond language and text.</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, one of the most natural ways people</p>
<p>engage with information is visually.</p>
<p>With generative AI, we can already</p>
<p>automate 360-degree spins of sneakers</p>
<p>from just a handful of still photos, something</p>
<p>that would have previously required merchants</p>
<p>to use hundreds of product photos and costly technology.</p>
<p>As we look ahead, you can imagine</p>
<p>how generative AI will enable people</p>
<p>to interact with visual information in entirely</p>
<p>new ways.</p>
<p>They might help a local baker collaborate on a cake design</p>
<p>with a client or a toymaker dream up a new creation.</p>
<p>They might help someone envision what their kitchen looks like</p>
<p>but with green cabinets instead of wood,</p>
<p>or describe and find the perfect complementary pocket square</p>
<p>to match a new blazer.</p>
<p>In our quest to make Search more natural and intuitive,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve gone from enabling you to search your text to voice,</p>
<p>to images, to combination of modalities,</p>
<p>like you saw with Multisearch today that Liz talked about.</p>
<p>As we continue to bring generative AI technologies</p>
<p>into our products, the only limit to Search</p>
<p>will be your imagination.</p>
<p>Beyond our own products, it&rsquo;s important to make</p>
<p>it easy, safe, and scalable for others</p>
<p>to benefit from these advances.</p>
<p>Next month, we&rsquo;ll start onboarding developers,</p>
<p>creators, and enterprises so they</p>
<p>can try a generative language API, initially powered</p>
<p>with LaMDA, with a range of models to follow.</p>
<p>Over time, we&rsquo;ll create a suite of tools and APIs</p>
<p>to make it easy for others to build applications with API.</p>
<p>From Bard to the new AI-powered features in Search</p>
<p>to image generation, APIs, and beyond, when it comes to AI,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s critical, critical that we bring</p>
<p>these experiences rooted in the models</p>
<p>to the world responsibility.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve been focusing on responsible AI</p>
<p>since the very beginning.</p>
<p>We were one of the first companies</p>
<p>to articulate AI principles.</p>
<p>We are also embracing the opportunity</p>
<p>to work with creative communities and partners</p>
<p>to develop these tools.</p>
<p>AI will be the most profound way to expand access</p>
<p>to high-quality information and improve the lives of people</p>
<p>around the world, committed to setting the high standard</p>
<p>on how to bring it to people in a way that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>both bold and responsible.</p>
<p>So far, you&rsquo;ve seen how we are applying state-of-the-art AI</p>
<p>technologies to help you understand</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s information across languages and modalities.</p>
<p>AI is also making it far more natural</p>
<p>to make sense of and explore the real world, like with Google</p>
<p>Maps.</p>
<p>Over the Chris to share more.</p>
<p>Come on up, Chris.</p>
<p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
<p>CHRIS PHILLIPS: Thanks, Prabhakar.</p>
<p>For 18 years, Google Maps has transformed how</p>
<p>people make sense of the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a valuable tool for over 1 billion people,</p>
<p>helping them avoid traffic jams on the way to work,</p>
<p>find restaurants in a new city, and so much more.</p>
<p>And the latest advancements in AI and computer vision</p>
<p>are powering the next generation of Google Maps,</p>
<p>making it more immersive and sustainable than ever before.</p>
<p>Let me show you what I mean.</p>
<p>Before Google Maps, getting directions</p>
<p>meant physically printing them out on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>But Google Maps reimagined what a map could be,</p>
<p>bringing live traffic and helpful information</p>
<p>about places right to your phone.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re transforming Google Maps once again,</p>
<p>evolving our 2D map into a multidimensional view</p>
<p>of the real world that comes alive,</p>
<p>starting with Immersive View.</p>
<p>Immersive View is a brand-new way</p>
<p>to explore that&rsquo;s far more natural and intuitive.</p>
<p>It uses AI to fuse billions of Street View and aerial images</p>
<p>to create a rich digital model of the world,</p>
<p>letting you truly experience a place before you step inside.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re considering a visit, you</p>
<p>can virtually soar over the building, finding the entrances</p>
<p>and get a sense of what&rsquo;s in the area.</p>
<p>With the Time Slider, you can see</p>
<p>what it looks like at different times of the day</p>
<p>and what the weather will be so you know when you visit.</p>
<p>To help you avoid crowds, we want to point out</p>
<p>areas that tend to be busy.</p>
<p>So you have all the information you need to confidently make</p>
<p>a decision about where to go.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re hungry, you can explore different restaurants</p>
<p>in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>You can even glide down the street, peek inside it,</p>
<p>and understand the vibe before you book a reservation.</p>
<p>This stunning, photorealistic indoor view</p>
<p>is powered by neural radiance fields.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an advanced AI technique that</p>
<p>uses 2D images to generate a highly accurate 3D</p>
<p>representation that recreates the entire context of a place,</p>
<p>including its lighting, the texture of materials,</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s in the background.</p>
<p>You can also see if our restaurant&rsquo;s lighting is</p>
<p>good for a date night or if the outdoor view at a cafe</p>
<p>is the right place for lunch with friends.</p>
<p>Immersive View represents a completely new way</p>
<p>to interact with the map, using all the detailed information</p>
<p>in Google Maps today and visualizing it</p>
<p>in a more intuitive way.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re excited that Immersive View starts rolling out today</p>
<p>in London Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and Tokyo.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re bringing it to more European cities,</p>
<p>like Amsterdam, Dublin, Florence, and Venice</p>
<p>in the coming months.</p>
<p>Immersive View is just one example</p>
<p>of how artificial intelligence is powering a more</p>
<p>visual and intuitive map.</p>
<p>It also helps us reimagine how you find places</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re on the go.</p>
<p>You heard Prabhakar talk about how</p>
<p>your camera&rsquo;s the new keyboard.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also true for the map.</p>
<p>Search with Live View uses AI paired with augmented reality</p>
<p>to help you visually find things nearby,</p>
<p>like ATMs, restaurants, and transit hubs</p>
<p>just by lifting up your phone.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve recently launched Search with Live</p>
<p>View in several cities, including here in Paris.</p>
<p>In the coming months, we&rsquo;ll start</p>
<p>expanding it to more places, like Barcelona, Dublin,</p>
<p>and Madrid.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s head outside to where Rachel</p>
<p>will show us how it works.</p>
<p>Over to you, Rachel.</p>
<p>RACHEL: Thanks, Chris.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m out here scoping out the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Whenever I come to a new city, I&rsquo;m always</p>
<p>on the hunt for great coffee.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see what I can find.</p>
<p>Tapping on the Camera icon in the Search Bar,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m able to see coffee shops, as well</p>
<p>as other categories of places, like restaurants, bars,</p>
<p>and stores.</p>
<p>I can even see places that are out of my field of view.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m really able to get a sense of what this neighborhood</p>
<p>has to offer at a glance.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s look at coffee shops specifically because I really</p>
<p>need some caffeine.</p>
<p>All right, so it looks like we have a few good coffee</p>
<p>options right around here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m able to see if these places are open,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re busy right now, and if they&rsquo;re highly rated.</p>
<p>This one looks pretty good.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to tap on it to learn more.</p>
<p>All right, OK, this looks pretty good.</p>
<p>It has a lot.</p>
<p>It has a high star rating.</p>
<p>This looks really tasty and cute.</p>
<p>All right, and it&rsquo;s not too busy right now.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to head over there and grab an espresso.</p>
<p>Back to you, Chris.</p>
<p>CHRIS PHILLIPS: Wow.</p>
<p>Thanks, Rachel.</p>
<p>[APPLAUSE]</p>
<p>As you can see, pairing our AI with AR</p>
<p>is transforming how we interact with the world.</p>
<p>Augmented reality can be especially helpful</p>
<p>when navigating tricky places indoors,</p>
<p>like airports, train stations, and shopping centers.</p>
<p>We launched Indoor Live View in select cities</p>
<p>to help you do just that.</p>
<p>It uses AR arrows to help you find things</p>
<p>like nearest elevators, baggage claim, and food courts.</p>
<p>Today we&rsquo;re excited to announce that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>embarking on the largest expansion of Indoor Live</p>
<p>View to date.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re bringing it to 1,000 new venues in cities like Berlin,</p>
<p>London, New York, Tokyo, and right</p>
<p>here in Paris in the coming months.</p>
<p>Today, you&rsquo;ve seen how the future of maps</p>
<p>is becoming more visual and immersive.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re also making it more sustainable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about helping people make the sustainable</p>
<p>choice, the easy choice.</p>
<p>We recently launched ecofriendly routing in Europe</p>
<p>to help you choose the most fuel-efficient,</p>
<p>energy-efficient energy efficient route</p>
<p>to your destination whether you drive a petrol, diesel,</p>
<p>electric, or hybrid vehicle.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;re seeing more drivers embrace electric vehicles,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re launching new Maps features for EVs</p>
<p>with Google built in to make sure you have enough charge,</p>
<p>no matter where you&rsquo;re headed.</p>
<p>First, to help alleviate range anxiety,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll use AI to suggest the best charging</p>
<p>stop, whether you&rsquo;re taking a road trip</p>
<p>or just running errands nearby.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll factor in traffic, charge level, and the energy</p>
<p>consumption of your trip.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a rush, we&rsquo;ll help you find stations</p>
<p>where you can charge your car quickly with our new very</p>
<p>fast charging filter.</p>
<p>For many cars, this can give you enough power</p>
<p>to fill up and get back on the road in less than 40 minutes.</p>
<p>Lastly, we&rsquo;re making it easier to see</p>
<p>when places like supermarkets have charging stations</p>
<p>on site with a new EV icon.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re on your way to pick up groceries,</p>
<p>you can choose a store that also lets you charge your car.</p>
<p>Look out for these Maps features in the coming</p>
<p>months for cars with Google built in wherever</p>
<p>EV charging is available.</p>
<p>To help drivers make the shift to electric vehicles,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re focused on creating great EV experiences</p>
<p>across all of our products.</p>
<p>For instance, in Waze, we&rsquo;ll soon</p>
<p>be making it easy for drivers to specify their EV plug</p>
<p>types so they can find the right charging</p>
<p>station along their route.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not just focused on driving.</p>
<p>In many places, people are choosing</p>
<p>more sustainable options, like walking, biking, or taking</p>
<p>transit.</p>
<p>On Google Maps, we&rsquo;re making it even simpler to get around</p>
<p>with new glanceable directions.</p>
<p>For example, when you&rsquo;re walking,</p>
<p>you can track your journey right from your route overview.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s perfect for those times when you need to see your path.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll give you easy access to updated ETAs</p>
<p>and show you where to make the next turn, information that</p>
<p>was previously only available by using</p>
<p>our comprehensive Navigation Mode.</p>
<p>Glanceable directions start rolling out globally</p>
<p>on Android and iOS in the coming months.</p>
<p>Making a global impact requires everyone</p>
<p>to come together, including cities, people, and businesses.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve worked with cities</p>
<p>for years to provide key insights through Environmental</p>
<p>Insights Explorer, or EIE, a free platform designed to help</p>
<p>cities measure emissions.</p>
<p>The Dublin City Council has been using</p>
<p>EIE to analyze bicycle usage across the city</p>
<p>and implement smart transportation policies.</p>
<p>And in Copenhagen, we&rsquo;re using Street View cars</p>
<p>to measure hyperlocal air quality with Project Air View.</p>
<p>With this data, the city is designing low-emission zones</p>
<p>and exploring ways to build schools and playgrounds away</p>
<p>from high-pollution areas.</p>
<p>These are just a few ways that AI</p>
<p>is helping us reimagine the future of Google Maps,</p>
<p>making it more immersive and sustainable</p>
<p>for both people and cities around the world.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;ll turn it over to Marzia</p>
<p>to talk about the work we&rsquo;re doing in Europe with Google</p>
<p>Arts &amp; Culture.</p>
<p>[APPLAUSE]</p>
<p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
<p>MARZIA NICCOLAI: Thank you, Chris.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exciting to see how Google Maps keeps</p>
<p>getting more helpful.</p>
<p>For the past decade, our daily work at Google Arts &amp; Culture</p>
<p>has also been about finding new pathways, specifically</p>
<p>those at the intersection of technology and culture.</p>
<p>Together with our 3,000 partners from over 80 countries,</p>
<p>we brought dinosaurs to life in virtual reality,</p>
<p>digitized and preserved the famed Timbuktu Manuscripts,</p>
<p>recrafted a destroyed Mayan limestone staircase,</p>
<p>and found a way for us humans to find our four-legged friend&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doppelganger and famous artworks.</p>
<p>As for the latter, at least one of Chris&rsquo;s dogs</p>
<p>apparently spent a previous life in Renaissance Venice.</p>
<p>Perhaps you might also have heard of our work</p>
<p>through our popular Art Selfie feature, which helped over</p>
<p>200 million people find their doppelganger</p>
<p>in famous artworks.</p>
<p>But what you probably didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>is that Art Selfie was actually the first on-device AI</p>
<p>application from Google and that we</p>
<p>have applied AI to cultural pursuits</p>
<p>in our Google Arts &amp; Culture lab in Paris for over five years.</p>
<p>So today, I&rsquo;d like to show you what</p>
<p>artificial intelligence in the hands of creatives and cultural</p>
<p>experts can achieve.</p>
<p>For our first example, I would like</p>
<p>to welcome the blobs to the digital stage.</p>
<p>[OPERA MUSIC]</p>
<p>[APPLAUSE]</p>
<p>Thank you, blobs.</p>
<p>Now, some of you might recognize the hallmarks of good opera</p>
<p>right away&ndash;</p>
<p>bass, tenor, mezzo soprano, and soprano.</p>
<p>And if you aren&rsquo;t familiar with the world of opera singing,</p>
<p>this experiment, created in collaboration</p>
<p>with artist David Li, is for you and will</p>
<p>be your gateway to learn more.</p>
<p>For Blob Opera, we teamed up with four professional opera</p>
<p>singers whose voices trained a neural network,</p>
<p>essentially teaching the AI algorithm</p>
<p>how to sing and harmonize.</p>
<p>So when you conduct the blobs to create your very own opera,</p>
<p>what you hear aren&rsquo;t the voices of the opera singers,</p>
<p>but instead the neural network&rsquo;s interpretation of what opera</p>
<p>singing sounds like.</p>
<p>Give it a try and join&ndash; try and join the many people</p>
<p>from around the world who have spent</p>
<p>over 80 million minutes in this playful AI experiment</p>
<p>to learn about opera.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ve seen and heard, AI can create new and even playful</p>
<p>ways for people to engage with culture.</p>
<p>But it can also be applied to preserve intangible heritage.</p>
<p>As Prabhakar shared earlier, access</p>
<p>to language and translation tools</p>
<p>is a powerful way to make the world&rsquo;s information more</p>
<p>accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>But I was surprised to learn that out</p>
<p>of the 7,000 languages spoken in Earth, more than 3,000</p>
<p>are currently under threat of disappearing,</p>
<p>amongst them Maori, Louisiana Creole, Sanskrit,</p>
<p>and Calabrian Greek.</p>
<p>To support these communities in preserving and sharing</p>
<p>their languages, we created an easily usable language</p>
<p>preservation tool called Woolaroo, which, by the way,</p>
<p>is the word for photo in the Aboriginal language</p>
<p>of Tugambeh.</p>
<p>So how does it work?</p>
<p>Once you open Woolaroo and your mobile phone&rsquo;s browser,</p>
<p>select one of the 17 languages currently</p>
<p>featured and just take a photo of your surroundings.</p>
<p>Woolaroo, with the help of AI-powered object recognition,</p>
<p>will then try to identify what is in the frame</p>
<p>and match it against its growing library of words.</p>
<p>For me, this tool is special because it</p>
<p>shows how I can help to make a tangible difference</p>
<p>for communities and real people, like the ones shown here,</p>
<p>in their struggle to preserve their unique heritage.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s have a look of AI in the service</p>
<p>of cultural institutions and how it can help uncover what</p>
<p>has been lost or overlooked.</p>
<p>Women on the forefront of science</p>
<p>have often not received proper credit or acknowledgment</p>
<p>for their essential work.</p>
<p>To take another step to rectify this,</p>
<p>we teamed up with researchers at the Smithsonian American</p>
<p>Women&rsquo;s History Initiative and developed</p>
<p>an experimental AI-driven research</p>
<p>tool that first compares archival records across history</p>
<p>by connecting different nodes in the metadata.</p>
<p>Secondly, it&rsquo;s able to identify women scientists on variations</p>
<p>in their name because sometimes they</p>
<p>have to do things use their husband&rsquo;s</p>
<p>name in a publication.</p>
<p>And third, it&rsquo;s capable of analyzing image records</p>
<p>to cluster and recover female contributors.</p>
<p>The initial results have been extremely promising</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t wait to apply this technology</p>
<p>to uncover even more accomplishments of women</p>
<p>in science.</p>
<p>Preserving cultural heritage online is core to our mission.</p>
<p>We work hard to ensure that the knowledge and treasures</p>
<p>provided by our cultural partners</p>
<p>show up where it&rsquo;s of most benefit,</p>
<p>when people are searching online.</p>
<p>Say you search for Artemisia Gentileschi,</p>
<p>the most successful yet often overlooked</p>
<p>female painter of the Baroque period.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to explore many of her artworks,</p>
<p>including &ldquo;Self-Portrait of Saint Catherine,&rdquo;</p>
<p>that have been provided by our partner,</p>
<p>the National Gallery of London, in high resolution.</p>
<p>When you click on it, you&rsquo;ll be able to zoom into the brush</p>
<p>stroke level to see all the rich detail of the work.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll never be able to get that close in the museum.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, you&rsquo;re actually able to bring</p>
<p>this and many other artworks right into your home.</p>
<p>Just click on the View in Augmented Reality button</p>
<p>on your mobile phone to teleport Artemisia&rsquo;s masterpiece</p>
<p>in its original size right in front of you.</p>
<p>But culture doesn&rsquo;t stop at classical art.</p>
<p>So keep your eyes open for a variety of 3D</p>
<p>and augmented reality assets provided</p>
<p>by cultural institutions.</p>
<p>One of my favorite, besides the James Webb Space Telescope,</p>
<p>is one of the most popular queries for students,</p>
<p>the periodic table, for which I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>happy to announce we&rsquo;ll triple the number</p>
<p>of available languages to include French, Spanish,</p>
<p>German, and more in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>3D and AR models in Google Search</p>
<p>really unlock people&rsquo;s curiosity.</p>
<p>And in the past year alone, we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen an 8x increase in people engaging</p>
<p>with AR models contributed by Google Arts &amp; Culture partners</p>
<p>to explore and learn.</p>
<p>Those are just some of the examples</p>
<p>of what awaits at the intersection</p>
<p>of artificial intelligence and culture</p>
<p>and how we work with our partners to make</p>
<p>more culture available online.</p>
<p>I invite you to discover all of that and much more</p>
<p>in the Google Arts &amp; Culture App.</p>
<p>Thank you and back to Prabhakar.</p>

<p>PRABHAKAR RAGHAVAN: Thanks, Marzia.</p>
<p>Today you saw how we are applying state-of-the-art AI</p>
<p>technologies to make our information products more</p>
<p>helpful for you, to create experiences that are</p>
<p>as multidimensional as the people who rely on them.</p>
<p>We call this making Search more natural and intuitive.</p>
<p>But for you, we hope that it means</p>
<p>that when you next seek information,</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t be confined by the language it originated in.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t be constrained to typing words in a search box.</p>
<p>And you won&rsquo;t be beholden to a single way of searching.</p>
<p>Although we are 25 years into Search,</p>
<p>I daresay that our story has just begun.</p>
<p>We have even more exciting AI-enabled innovations</p>
<p>in the works that will change the way people search,</p>
<p>work, and play.</p>
<p>We are reinventing what it means to search.</p>
<p>And the best is yet to come.</p>
<p>Thank you all.</p>
<p>Merci.</p>
