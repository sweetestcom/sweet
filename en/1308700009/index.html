    <p>Our card this week is Donna Lemon, the Seven of Spades from Idaho. Donna was a young woman</p>
<p>working as a nurse and had a hopeful future, but her life was cut far too short. And her</p>
<p>death has been clouded in mystery for almost 50 years. But all of that could change very</p>
<p>soon. I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>On July 5th, 1973, in a beautiful area of Montana known as Gallatin Canyon, Sherry Pierce</p>
<p>was at her house waiting for her friend Donna to come over. Sherry lived about 45 minutes</p>
<p>southwest of a town called Bozeman. Nowadays, this region is a popular tourist attraction</p>
<p>because of the Big Sky Ski Resort. But back in 1973, the resort was just being built,</p>
<p>and a lot of the mountainous area was undisturbed. This particular week was the 4th of July,</p>
<p>and Sherry and Donna had made plans to go horseback riding at 4 o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon,</p>
<p>something they did for fun all the time. Well, 4 o&rsquo;clock came and went, and Sherry noticed</p>
<p>that Donna was late. After a few more minutes of waiting around, Sherry called Donna&rsquo;s</p>
<p>parents&rsquo; house, which was only about 5 miles up the road. Now, Donna didn&rsquo;t live</p>
<p>with her parents, she was 20 years old and worked as a full-time nurse at the Bozeman</p>
<p>Health Deaconess Hospital and had her own place. But Sherry figured because it was a</p>
<p>holiday week and Donna would have been going right past her family&rsquo;s house in order to</p>
<p>get to Sherry&rsquo;s, maybe Donna had stopped in to see her parents. Unfortunately, no one</p>
<p>answered at Donna&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; house, so Sherry waited a few more minutes before she</p>
<p>jumped in her car and drove around the canyon to look for her friend. Sherry did that for</p>
<p>about an hour and a half before eventually returning home and calling Donna&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>again, this time around 6 o&rsquo;clock. During that second phone call, Donna&rsquo;s parents,</p>
<p>George and Clara Lou picked up, but they told Sherry that Donna hadn&rsquo;t been by all day</p>
<p>and they hadn&rsquo;t seen her, which struck Sherry as odd. If Donna didn&rsquo;t go to her parents'</p>
<p>house and hadn&rsquo;t called to cancel with her, then where was she? This was super unlike</p>
<p>her.</p>
<p>So Sherry, along with Donna&rsquo;s parents, joined efforts and decided to retrace the</p>
<p>roads of Gallatin Valley to look for Donna or any sign of the 1969 green Mustang she</p>
<p>drove. But the longer they kept driving, the more worried they got. It was starting to</p>
<p>get dark and they had not seen any sign of Donna or her car. They retreated back to the</p>
<p>Lemons&rsquo; house and started calling around to see if any of Donna&rsquo;s other friends or</p>
<p>maybe co-workers had seen her. Detective Mike Hammer, who&rsquo;s working the case today, told</p>
<p>us that even though family and friends were worried about Donna at this point, they were</p>
<p>not in a full-blown panic mode yet. They tried to stay calm and come up with reasonable explanations</p>
<p>as to why Donna had not called.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the 70s, so communication&rsquo;s a little slow. There were some assumptions, maybe she,</p>
<p>you know, somewhere else with other friends, other family members. So there was a lot of</p>
<p>that, well, let&rsquo;s wait and see if she shows up type mentality.</p>
<p>But by the next morning, Friday, July 6th, when there was still no word from Donna, her</p>
<p>dad George went to the Gallatin County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office to officially report his daughter missing.</p>
<p>As is common in a lot of missing person cases, law enforcement at first didn&rsquo;t suspect the</p>
<p>worst case scenario. Back then, Gallatin County was not known for murder or any serious violent</p>
<p>crime. So detectives took George&rsquo;s report and said, you know, we&rsquo;ll look into it. But</p>
<p>since it was the 4th of July holiday, they figured Donna was just out and about, maybe</p>
<p>with a boyfriend or something and just hadn&rsquo;t contacted her family because she was busy.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not how the Lemon family felt though. Donna&rsquo;s little sister Verna told</p>
<p>the Montana Press Monthly, quote, we knew something was wrong. Though the protocol of</p>
<p>law enforcement for someone Donna&rsquo;s age was that she probably had a fight with her</p>
<p>boyfriend or that she had run off with a boyfriend, not to deal with it right away, end quote.</p>
<p>Donna&rsquo;s family insisted she would never take off without notice. And moreover, she</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have a serious boyfriend at the time. I mean, sure, she&rsquo;d gone on dates with a</p>
<p>few guys here and there in those last few months, but no one that she would run away</p>
<p>with. Donna enjoyed spending a lot of her free time with her family, and she was especially</p>
<p>close with her dad. He&rsquo;d raised his girls to love the outdoors and they did a lot of</p>
<p>activities together. Donna would go hunting, rock climbing and backcountry skiing with</p>
<p>her dad and siblings. And even though she&rsquo;d moved out of the family home, she usually</p>
<p>stopped by a couple of times a week. So by the afternoon of July 6th, when she&rsquo;d been</p>
<p>missing for a full 24 hours, Gallatin County authorities agreed to help kickstart a more</p>
<p>formal search. They put out an all points bulletin for the Mustang and scrounged together</p>
<p>some deputies and community volunteers to search nearby woods and canyons for her. Almost</p>
<p>everybody in that immediate area was looking for her. With the search underway, police</p>
<p>began investigating and trying to figure out who the last person was to see Donna. They</p>
<p>tried to piece together a rough timeline of her week leading up to that point, but that</p>
<p>proved challenging because you see, Donna had not been in her usual routine that week.</p>
<p>She was in the process of moving to a new apartment. Sherry told police that she&rsquo;d</p>
<p>been with Donna on July 3rd and the 4th in the nearby town of Ennis, Montana. They had</p>
<p>gone to a rodeo together and everything seemed totally fine with Donna then. She said Donna</p>
<p>was having a good time with friends and didn&rsquo;t appear to be down or in distress about anything.</p>
<p>On the morning of July 5th, just a few hours before Donna was supposed to meet up with</p>
<p>Sherry, she got together with her sister, Verna, at a restaurant called the Corral Bar</p>
<p>and they had an early lunch together. Verna said that she and Donna ordered hamburgers</p>
<p>and bottles of Coke and the whole time that they were there, nothing was out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>So the next place police turned to for clues and to pin down Donna&rsquo;s timeline was the</p>
<p>hospital where she worked. Deputies confirmed with staff there that Donna swung by around</p>
<p>1 o&rsquo;clock on July 5th to pick up her paycheck. And after that, her financial records show</p>
<p>that she went straight to the bank to deposit the check and made a cash withdrawal. Detective</p>
<p>Hammer said that the case reports indicate that Donna deposited $200 and got out about</p>
<p>$116 in cash. The next confirmed sighting of Donna was shortly after she left the bank.</p>
<p>Her cousin, a teenage girl named Patricia, ran into Donna at a boutique in town. Patricia</p>
<p>told police that Donna mentioned she&rsquo;d been looking for a new shirt or dress to wear to</p>
<p>a family reunion that was scheduled for the upcoming weekend. And then after that, the</p>
<p>last confirmed sighting of Donna on July 5th was at a place in town called Stacy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Old Faithful Bar.</p>
<p>The lady that works at the bar saw her come in somewhere between 2.30 and 4 o&rsquo;clock,</p>
<p>come in and purchase a beer. She spent about five minutes in the bar, paid for it with</p>
<p>a dollar bill. She got changed, seemed pleasant, and then walked out. So talking to her friends,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not abnormal. It&rsquo;s not a regular thing that she buys beer. It was a normal, fairly</p>
<p>common thing. She would a lot of times take the beer and then drink them, you know, stop</p>
<p>by the river and watch it according to a friend, you know, watch the river and smoke cigarettes</p>
<p>and drink a beer.</p>
<p>The bartender told police that Donna seemed fine when she came in. She just bought that</p>
<p>one can of beer and then left. There was one local woman who came forward and told police</p>
<p>that she thought she saw Donna&rsquo;s car leaving Stacy&rsquo;s Bar and heading east toward the highway</p>
<p>right before 4 p.m. The way this witness described Donna driving would have meant that she was</p>
<p>definitely headed in the direction that she would have needed to be in in order to meet</p>
<p>Sherry at her house for horseback riding. Detective Hammer has said that the case file</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the witness mentioned anything about seeing another person in the</p>
<p>car with Donna. On top of that, this woman&rsquo;s memory sort of ebbed and flowed. And today,</p>
<p>law enforcement can&rsquo;t 100% confirm that sighting of Donna. Either way, Donna&rsquo;s family</p>
<p>reunion that weekend came and went, and there was still no sign of her or her car.</p>
<p>Volunteers and deputies searched for the Mustang in all the obvious places. Her old apartment</p>
<p>that she shared with a friend, her new apartment that she was moving into, her parents&rsquo; house,</p>
<p>the hospital, and various other businesses in and around the county, but it never showed</p>
<p>up. Deputies did all they could to learn as much as possible about Donna and what her</p>
<p>life was like, particularly right before she went missing. And obviously, they looked into</p>
<p>why she was making that move to a new apartment. And it turns out it was just because that</p>
<p>friend that she was living with was about to get married. Donna had decided to get her</p>
<p>own place, which was actually closer to Bozeman where she worked. She&rsquo;d planned to continue</p>
<p>nursing school and get her advanced nursing degree to set her up for a long career in</p>
<p>health care. So police pretty much ruled out any scenario where Donna and her old roommate,</p>
<p>or really anyone for that matter, had gotten into a fight or there had been any bad blood</p>
<p>that would have led to Donna moving out. It was just time for Donna to make room for her</p>
<p>roommate&rsquo;s fiance and to get a place of her own. Police carefully searched her old apartment,</p>
<p>her new rental unit, and her parents&rsquo; house for any clues, but all of their efforts came</p>
<p>up empty. The most glaring piece of information they learned from their searches was that</p>
<p>it was obvious Donna had left personal belongings behind at both her old place and her new one,</p>
<p>which meant it was highly unlikely she&rsquo;d just gone out of town or ran away with someone.</p>
<p>As Montana police were stitching together Donna&rsquo;s timeline and making these observations at her</p>
<p>apartments, the case took a dark turn. An Idaho police officer, hundreds of miles away from</p>
<p>Gallatin, made a discovery that turned everything upside down. On the night of July 7th, just a few</p>
<p>days after Donna vanished from Gallatin County, Montana, an Idaho Falls, Idaho police officer</p>
<p>named Dennis Tremaine was working the night shift. Around 10 o&rsquo;clock he was patrolling not</p>
<p>far from the city&rsquo;s police department in the heart of downtown when he noticed a car parked</p>
<p>on the side of one of the main streets. He made a mental note of the car because it was parked in</p>
<p>kind of a weird spot so late at night, but he decided to just leave it alone. But the next night,</p>
<p>July 8th, the officer saw the Mustang again, still parked in the exact same spot, and it looked like</p>
<p>it hadn&rsquo;t been moved at all. So a Idaho Falls policeman actually stopped, looked at it, did a</p>
<p>check, noticed that the car was unlocked, noticed the keys were in it, actually put the keys in the</p>
<p>glove box for safety. Do we know why he stopped to check it out? Did someone report it as like</p>
<p>abandoned? No, it was just it&rsquo;s just in a parking lot. It was late at night and that&rsquo;s a, you know,</p>
<p>standard operation for police to kind of just check on those vehicles. The car was just the</p>
<p>first discovery. The next night, another discovery was made that confirmed everyone&rsquo;s worst fears about Donna.</p>
<p>The evening of July 9th, a man walking his dog on a dirt path in downtown Idaho Falls stopped when he saw something odd in the brush. There, laying under some trees, in a pool of blood, was a woman&rsquo;s body. Immediately, this man called 9-1-1 and reported what he&rsquo;d found.</p>
<p>The body was clothed. It was hidden under some bushes. She was laying on her back. She had a</p>
<p>stab wound in her side and her throat. It was slashed. Idaho Falls police responded to the scene, and Officer</p>
<p>Tremaine immediately wondered if this woman had any connection to the abandoned Mustang that he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>seen the two previous nights. He told the detectives working the homicide about spotting the car,</p>
<p>and they went to run the license plates. And ding, ding, ding. That&rsquo;s when they saw that</p>
<p>bulletin that was out for the car from Montana in relation to Donna Lemon. When they saw a photo of</p>
<p>Donna, there was no doubt in their minds, particularly because of the distinct eyeglasses</p>
<p>on top of the victim&rsquo;s head that were the same as the thick framed ones that Donna was always known</p>
<p>to wear. They had found her, and eventually, dental records confirmed their suspicions.</p>
<p>Idaho Falls investigators took a closer look at the Mustang, and something that wasn&rsquo;t obvious</p>
<p>to Officer Tremaine before became clear as day. There was blood in the car. Small amounts, not,</p>
<p>you know, large amounts. There&rsquo;s some on the driver&rsquo;s side door, and there&rsquo;s some inside</p>
<p>by the gearshift knob. So it wasn&rsquo;t noticeable to the Idaho Falls police officer? He did not</p>
<p>notice it. It was dark, and he wasn&rsquo;t, you know, particularly looking for it. Once they found the</p>
<p>body and kind of put it together, they went back there and then noticed it was, you know,</p>
<p>it was evident that it was there. Just wasn&rsquo;t looking for it. And was that her blood? That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of the questions we&rsquo;re still trying to answer. A bloody palm print was near the inside</p>
<p>of the driver&rsquo;s side door. Also inside was the insole of one of Donna&rsquo;s shoes,</p>
<p>which told detectives that she might have tried to get away from her killer, either by</p>
<p>running or fighting. Technology in the 70s wasn&rsquo;t as advanced as it is now, so the only testing that</p>
<p>authorities could do on the blood was typing, which isn&rsquo;t super detailed, but at the time,</p>
<p>it was better than nothing. If they could figure out the blood type, they could compare that to</p>
<p>Donna, and if it didn&rsquo;t belong to her, then it could have come from her killer. Police took</p>
<p>samples as they processed the car and lifted fingerprints, particularly the palm prints,</p>
<p>as best they could. Then Idaho police officially linked up with the Gallatin County investigators</p>
<p>in Montana, and they all got started on a homicide investigation. But the jurisdictional waters got</p>
<p>kind of muddied at this point, because neither agency could prove which state Donna had actually</p>
<p>been killed in. They just knew that her body was left in Idaho, and whoever her killer had been</p>
<p>had fled from downtown Idaho Falls, leaving her and her car behind.</p>
<p>Looking through the case file, Detective Hammer has come up with a theory that he thinks could</p>
<p>explain how the killer got away. He says that it&rsquo;s possible that whoever was responsible for</p>
<p>the crime likely walked to a nearby Greyhound bus station in Idaho Falls after ditching Donna</p>
<p>and her car. You see, the Mustang was parked just a few blocks away from the bus depot, so that may</p>
<p>be one way that he skipped town pretty much undetected. On the other hand, he said it would</p>
<p>also not surprise him if the killer hitchhiked. A lot of people did that in the 70s. Because Idaho</p>
<p>Falls is near a major highway, it wouldn&rsquo;t take long for someone to get out of sight and out of</p>
<p>mind within minutes if they got picked up. No matter how the suspect got away, what&rsquo;s important is that</p>
<p>he left some evidence behind. Detectives dug for days to find some sort of connection between Donna</p>
<p>and Idaho Falls, but they couldn&rsquo;t find anything. That family reunion I mentioned earlier that Donna</p>
<p>was supposed to go to the weekend after she vanished was in Idaho, but in Moscow, Idaho,</p>
<p>which is a completely different part of the state, like eight hours away from Idaho Falls.</p>
<p>So if Donna had no reason to be there, detectives had to wonder if maybe Donna&rsquo;s killer had some</p>
<p>connection to Idaho Falls. But who that was, who would want to kill Donna in such a brutal way,</p>
<p>was still a mystery. As the investigation continued, detectives started evaluating</p>
<p>critical clues that would help them establish a possible motive for murder. Notably, nowhere</p>
<p>around Donna&rsquo;s body or in her car did police find her purse. But remember, Montana investigators knew</p>
<p>that Donna had deposited her paycheck and withdrawn cash on July 5th. Now, they assumed she could have</p>
<p>spent some of that $116 while running errands before she vanished, and that bar where she was</p>
<p>seen before she disappeared. So they figured that by the time all of her shopping was done, Donna</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t have had a ton of cash on her, maybe like a hundred bucks or less. But here&rsquo;s the catch with that.</p>
<p>Investigators also knew that when Donna was found, she was still wearing a watch and earrings.</p>
<p>So if robbery was the motive, why didn&rsquo;t the killer take her jewelry and her car?</p>
<p>Authorities also couldn&rsquo;t rule out that Donna&rsquo;s murder was sexually motivated. The position in</p>
<p>which they had found Donna&rsquo;s body made police suspect that robbery was likely secondary to</p>
<p>some sort of sexual component. Detective Hammer said that Donna&rsquo;s legs were spread apart in a way</p>
<p>that was unnatural, like they were forced apart, not like she just fell down. But like Detective</p>
<p>Hammer said before, she was fully clothed except for one of her missing shoes. Unfortunately, back</p>
<p>in 1973, the only way to check to see if a victim had been sexually assaulted was by running a test</p>
<p>that checked for a body&rsquo;s level of acid phosphate enzymes. They didn&rsquo;t have the traditional tests</p>
<p>that we have today. One of Detective Hammer&rsquo;s colleagues at the Bonneville County Sheriff&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Office said this proved to be another challenge. She&rsquo;s badly decomposed and this even happens to</p>
<p>this day. You have a body that&rsquo;s decomposing. One of the issues is one of the enzymes you&rsquo;re looking for</p>
<p>for sexual assault matches your decomposition enzymes. When the test results for the enzymes</p>
<p>that would indicate sexual assault came back, they were highly positive. But as far as what</p>
<p>caused the enzyme results, that was inconclusive. Without a definitive motive and more than 200 miles</p>
<p>between where Donna was found and where she was last seen, police had to start weeding through a</p>
<p>massive pool of tips and potential suspects. First, there was the obvious question. Did Donna have an</p>
<p>ex-boyfriend or one of the guys she was maybe currently seeing who would want to hurt her?</p>
<p>We know she&rsquo;s dated a little bit so she had several people that she had dated and so I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if she had a steady boyfriend. Young men Donna had dated or had been seen with as recent as the</p>
<p>day before she died were all questioned, but all of them provided good enough alibis to investigators.</p>
<p>The rest of the year, police explored every possible theory and interviewed dozens of witnesses,</p>
<p>friends, family members, and people they thought could be persons of interest. But nothing panned</p>
<p>out. At one point, they even rigged up a giant magnet to a boat and dragged the Snake River to</p>
<p>see if they could find the murder weapon, assuming it was tossed into the water. But no knife surfaced.</p>
<p>And then, in 1974, to everyone&rsquo;s surprise, police made an announcement that someone was under arrest.</p>
<p>On January 24th, 1974, authorities who&rsquo;d been investigating Donna Lemon&rsquo;s murder announced</p>
<p>that they had taken a man into custody for the crime. The guy&rsquo;s name was Charles Hembree,</p>
<p>and back in July of 1973, he was a transient worker who&rsquo;d been camping in Gallatin County,</p>
<p>near where Donna lived. On the same day, Donna vanished. Police determined that for most of</p>
<p>1973, Charles had been hitchhiking his way back around the West. By the time they learned about</p>
<p>him, he was all the way in Nebraska. Detective Hammer said police found him because he had left</p>
<p>a tent, clothes, and food behind in Montana. Now, anyone could argue that Charles camping in the</p>
<p>same area at the same time Donna&rsquo;s abduction and murder occurred could just be a coincidence. But</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what Charles had in his tent and in his pockets that convinced police in Montana they</p>
<p>had their guy. Charles had two receipts from Idaho Falls, Idaho that were time stamped for</p>
<p>the exact week that Donna was found murdered. So, was it a coincidence that Charles was camping in</p>
<p>the same area Donna went missing and Idaho Falls when her body was found? Maybe. Maybe not.</p>
<p>Detective Hammer said that Charles was known to carry a knife and a pistol, which he claimed</p>
<p>were for hunting. But interestingly, he also had women&rsquo;s clothing in his tent. But out of all of</p>
<p>that, the main reason police took Charles into custody was because of a map and a disturbing</p>
<p>picture he had on him that they felt was super incriminating.</p>
<p>On the map, Charles had drawn an X where he left his tent in Gallatin County. He also marked another</p>
<p>X nearby, which made police wonder if that&rsquo;s where he killed Donna because on the back of this map</p>
<p>there was a drawing of a woman with her head cut off. With that information, Gallatin County</p>
<p>officials made sure that Charles was held in a Nebraska jail cell until they could get over to</p>
<p>interview him. When they got there, Charles agreed to take a polygraph test, but it&rsquo;s not known if</p>
<p>that test was ever completed. If it was, the results weren&rsquo;t published in any newspapers in 1974,</p>
<p>and the law enforcement agencies we interviewed for this episode don&rsquo;t have record of it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s wild is that not long after his arrest, charges against Charles were abruptly dismissed</p>
<p>because he was able to prove where he was on the day police believed Donna was killed,</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t Idaho Falls.</p>
<p>Charles said that he was driving cattle for a Montana rancher that week,</p>
<p>and his bosses confirmed he was near Billings, Montana on the day Donna was likely killed.</p>
<p>Not just that, but receipts from a tire change on the opposite side of Montana</p>
<p>also confirmed Charles was nowhere near Donna the day she vanished.</p>
<p>And as far as the women&rsquo;s clothing goes, well, Charles said that he was a crossdresser,</p>
<p>and that apparently checks out too. But what about the drawing of a decapitated woman?</p>
<p>Well, Charles admitted that he had some issues, but being creepy didn&rsquo;t make him a killer.</p>
<p>Not to mention, police were never able to prove a clear motive he would have had to kill Donna.</p>
<p>Detective Hammer also told our team that two knives found in the tent Charles left in Montana</p>
<p>were determined not to be the murder weapons. After that blunder,</p>
<p>Donna&rsquo;s case went cold, and stayed cold for the last 49 years.</p>
<p>Detectives have examined between seven and ten solid potential suspects,</p>
<p>all of whom are men who knew Donna or could have known her in passing.</p>
<p>But the investigation really ramped up just last year, when the Bonneville County Sheriff&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Office, where Detective Hammer is heading up the investigation,</p>
<p>sent some old DNA evidence in for additional testing.</p>
<p>The samples are still with the lab, but depending on what the science shows,</p>
<p>this could break the case wide open. Maybe the killer, like Donna&rsquo;s car,</p>
<p>has been hiding in plain sight all these decades. Maybe whoever did this is from Montana or Idaho</p>
<p>and still lives there. If they were the same age as Donna was in 1973, they&rsquo;d be in their</p>
<p>late 60s or early 70s today. Detective Hammer has this whiteboard up in his office that is</p>
<p>dedicated to Donna&rsquo;s case. He has scans of fingerprints taped up, maps with key locations</p>
<p>highlighted, and a diagram of the spot where Donna&rsquo;s body was found. When our reporter Emily</p>
<p>was there for this interview, Detective Hammer and his boss flipped through a binder about 10</p>
<p>inches thick, and they pondered the possibilities. If you&rsquo;ve ever driven from Bozeman to here,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s many, many places, and better places in my mind, you&rsquo;re going to commit a sexual assault</p>
<p>or burglary and dump a body. Between here and there, she would never have been found. So why there?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a point. The Snake River is a long, winding, and massive tributary in the mountains.</p>
<p>So their big question was, why did the killer leave Donna&rsquo;s body on the banks of that river?</p>
<p>Because if you wanted to get rid of a body, the Snake River would do it for you.</p>
<p>Leaving the car with blood in it and Donna in an area where she was definitely going to be found,</p>
<p>less than a mile from her car, makes investigators wonder if Donna&rsquo;s killer almost</p>
<p>wanted to leave clues behind. Detective Hammer and his colleagues are left to think about all</p>
<p>of these questions as they continue to comb through old interviews and evidence while they</p>
<p>wait for the DNA test results to come back. One piece of evidence Detective Hammer really wishes</p>
<p>they still had is Donna&rsquo;s 1969 Mustang. Back in the 70s, detectives gave the car back to the</p>
<p>Lemon family after it was fully processed, and then the Lemon family sold the car to someone</p>
<p>in Arizona. Detective Hammer says that it would be extremely helpful to re-examine that car today.</p>
<p>During all these years of investigation, and even that debacle with Charles Hembree,</p>
<p>police have never been able to truly rule out a stranger abduction and murder theory.</p>
<p>You see, in the summer of 1973 in Gallatin County, there were a lot of transient men working in</p>
<p>construction who were building that big Sky Ski Resort or working for the State Highway Department.</p>
<p>In essence, there were tons of potential Charles Hembree&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>You had people doing construction for the ski resorts, you had the roads that were being built,</p>
<p>and a lot of the infrastructure that you see now in that Gallatin Valley was being built up then.</p>
<p>Just based on what he told us, Detective Hammer is less inclined to accept a random serial killer</p>
<p>situation. Law enforcement believes Donna knew her killer. Even her family agrees with that theory.</p>
<p>The reason being Donna&rsquo;s personality. Donna&rsquo;s parents and friends said she was not the type</p>
<p>of person to pick up random hitchhikers. Though on the other hand, it might not have been out of</p>
<p>her character for her to stop and help someone who looked like they were broken down on the side</p>
<p>of the road or in need. But if she had done this, Donna&rsquo;s friends and family suspect that she would</p>
<p>have only done this for someone familiar to her. She would not have just stopped for a perfect</p>
<p>stranger if she was driving alone. Here&rsquo;s victim advocate and founder of the East Idaho Cold Cases</p>
<p>organization, Crystal Douglas, to explain a little more about Donna.</p>
<p>She was shy. She was helpful. She didn&rsquo;t engage in drama or gossip. She wasn&rsquo;t one of those type</p>
<p>of girls. She was a very close friend. She was a nurse, so she had a natural helping personality.</p>
<p>Just a kind of a down-home country girl is how people have described her, not an enemy</p>
<p>in the world. Just a nice girl from the gateway area. George and Clara Lou Lemon have passed away,</p>
<p>but Donna&rsquo;s sister, Verna, is still living. Crystal has interviewed her and lots of Donna&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other friends who were around back in 1973. Crystal has spent an extensive amount of time</p>
<p>learning about this case and even visited Gallatin County to document the key locations.</p>
<p>You can see her photos along with photos of Donna&rsquo;s car and old crime scene photos on our</p>
<p>website, thedeckpodcast.com. So knowing all she does about the case, Crystal agrees with the</p>
<p>Lemon family&rsquo;s theory that Donna could have stopped on her way to meet Sherry to help someone</p>
<p>in need if she recognized them. My theory is that driving down Mill Street as she left Stacy&rsquo;s bar,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s possible somebody maybe flagged her down or said hello and she pulled over to</p>
<p>say hello, hey can I get a ride? And that person was maybe drunk or high, violent,</p>
<p>maybe just an acquaintance or a friend or a brother of somebody maybe. And she didn&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>twice, sure I&rsquo;ll give you a ride down the road and there&rsquo;s where it happened. I&rsquo;ve always said</p>
<p>it was too thoughtful of a crime, why not run a car in the river, hide evidence, why not throw the</p>
<p>key in the river, why not use it for a few days and go have, you know, crazy fun down in Salt Lake,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make sense. Everyone, including law enforcement, has always agreed that Donna most</p>
<p>likely didn&rsquo;t see her attack coming and that whoever intercepted her on her way to go riding</p>
<p>with Sherry took control of Donna immediately. She was petite, it would have been easy to do,</p>
<p>she was like 110 pounds. They could have got her to do anything based on fear,</p>
<p>they could have verbally or with a weapon intimidated her to keep driving and nobody</p>
<p>would have thought twice seeing a couple in a car. Telling you about Donna&rsquo;s case for this episode</p>
<p>just reminds me that there is no time like the present to bring justice to a victim like Donna</p>
<p>Lemon. For almost 50 years her killer has gone unnamed and it is time we try and change that.</p>
<p>So listeners, I know this is a long shot but if you think you have her old Mustang or</p>
<p>know someone who has that car, contact Detective Mike Hammer at the Bonneville County Sheriff&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Office in Idaho Falls, Idaho. And if you or anyone you know has information about Donna Lemon&rsquo;s</p>
<p>murder, please come forward and try and help solve one of Idaho&rsquo;s oldest cold cases. All</p>
<p>information can be useful, even if you just think you have ways to help detectives fill in the</p>
<p>timeline of the last moments of Donna&rsquo;s life between July 5th and July 9th, 1973. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>encouraged to call the Bonneville County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office at 208-529-1200.</p>
