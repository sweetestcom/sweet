    <p>As you guys know, I get panic attacks at the dentist, but she was able to navigate me through</p>
<p>where I didn&rsquo;t. I only sweat through half my shirt. You have panic attacks at the dentist?</p>
<p>No, but I sweat profusely and I get very nervous. Why? What is that about? We all have weaknesses,</p>
<p>Jason. We all have weaknesses. This is my Achilles heel. My Achilles heel is a dentist.</p>
<p>Really? Yeah. I don&rsquo;t like going to the dentist either. No, the dentist really freaks. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know why it freaks me out, Sax. Have you thought about this? I had a really bad experience when I</p>
<p>was a kid. Tell us more about your childhood trauma. Have you ever seen the movie Marathon</p>
<p>Man? It was kind of like that. Is it safe? Is it safe? All right, here we go.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody. Hey, everybody. Welcome again to another episode of the All</p>
<p>In Podcast, episode 37. With us today on his noble crusade conquering Europe, Chamath</p>
<p>Palihapitiya calls us from a castle somewhere. I don&rsquo;t know. I can tell by the light switches</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in Europe. And joining us again, the two AIs, AI number one, David Sachs, and AI number</p>
<p>two, David Friedberg, are here. And of course, I&rsquo;m Jake Howell. Do we want to get right into the show</p>
<p>or I don&rsquo;t know, Chamath, if you want to talk about the dueling AIs in the group chat,</p>
<p>debating the nature of the pod? I mean, one guy told the other guy or one robot told the</p>
<p>other robot to fuck off. This is what we know. It&rsquo;s the singularity. It&rsquo;s when the robots start</p>
<p>arguing with each other. See, you don&rsquo;t even know because you don&rsquo;t have any emotions.</p>
<p>You told Friedberg to fuck off. Oh, that&rsquo;s kind of true.</p>
<p>He was drinking a beverage with 14% alcohol content. No, no, no. I just think that we,</p>
<p>I think the format of the pod is working and I don&rsquo;t think we need to turn it on its head.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all. I think my&hellip; So, just for the&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to do this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so tired and out of it right now, but let&rsquo;s do it. Just for the listeners&rsquo; benefit,</p>
<p>on our little group text where we do our incredibly well-prepped rehearsal for this</p>
<p>show by texting each other, maybe for four minutes a week, but the day before the show&hellip;</p>
<p>And insult each other for three hours.</p>
<p>Yeah, mostly other stuff is covered over the group chat. But we were kind of debating,</p>
<p>maybe throwing in a spin and, you know, doing a little group Q&amp;A kind of format.</p>
<p>Sax doesn&rsquo;t like it. And we were kind of joking with Sax that he loves</p>
<p>getting his soundbites in and then turning them into little short soundbite video clips with his</p>
<p>BFF Henry Belcaster and putting them on Twitter and promoting them around the internet.</p>
<p>And my point of view was, I don&rsquo;t think that this show should be about getting to the soundbite,</p>
<p>that this show should be about something very different, which is elevating a conversation</p>
<p>and creating the context for people to make decisions on their own.</p>
<p>And that is to give people multiple points of view and all of the data and consideration when</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big topic or a big debate underway. And it&rsquo;s too easy for us to take a soundbite</p>
<p>and then use that as the narrative to try and influence people to do things or to have a point</p>
<p>of view. And I think that is largely the problem we&rsquo;ve broadly had in the Twitter social media era</p>
<p>is we are very reductionist, we bring things down to kind of a one sentence or 140 character statement.</p>
<p>And then we use that as an emotional pivot point for people to get them to go on one side or the</p>
<p>other side, as opposed to recognizing that many of the topics we address are&hellip; that is the way</p>
<p>things are done. I get it. And here is Sax&rsquo;s response. That is a valid point,</p>
<p>Friedberg. However, humans all need to be led. They are sheeple. We need to tell the</p>
<p>sheeple what to think and to get Tucker Carlson into office. Jason, I would like to cut to</p>
<p>a segment, a new segment that I call Chamath does a dramatic reading.</p>
<p>So Friedberg did say this. And now a dramatic reading from the group chat.</p>
<p>I will be playing all characters, starting with myself. Friedberg rants, to which I say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m down with that. David Sax, you keep trying to fuck with the format of the show.</p>
<p>If it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it. Fuck off. Fuck you. Fuck her.</p>
<p>My response, I&rsquo;m down with that.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Am I going to be able to respond here?</p>
<p>Yes, go ahead.</p>
<p>Okay, Sax. In your defense, you&rsquo;re running for office, we know.</p>
<p>No, no, no. Look, I think that the Friedberg position on many issues often comes down to the</p>
<p>idea that this issue is so complicated, it&rsquo;s so nuanced, we can&rsquo;t have a definitive take.</p>
<p>And I just reject that. I think it&rsquo;s true for some issues. I think it&rsquo;s great to have the</p>
<p>conversation. But I think there are many issues where it is possible to have a definitive take,</p>
<p>to come down strongly on one side of it. And I think the audience wants us to do that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a little bit of a cop out to say, oh, we&rsquo;re just going to table all the issues.</p>
<p>So the audience can say, no, the audience wants to hear us give our point of view.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t seek Henry Belcaster out. He found us.</p>
<p>No. Yeah, but you just talk to him seven times a day and direct every frame of the animation.</p>
<p>Let him go.</p>
<p>No. Henry is one of our super fans, started making these videos, okay? I ignored the first 10.</p>
<p>And then finally, I was like, okay, I got to see what this guy&rsquo;s into, right? You did too.</p>
<p>You slid into his DMs.</p>
<p>What is this about? I hope it&rsquo;s to promote his business or something,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s just spending way too much time on this. Anyway, so now Henry does run his videos</p>
<p>by us as a courtesy, but he comes up with them. He chooses what takes he wants to run with,</p>
<p>and he puts it all together. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll have a note for him. I&rsquo;ll say, you know.</p>
<p>Oh my God. He&rsquo;s never sent me anything.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to get ahold of you. He keeps coming to me. Me and Jason are on a throne.</p>
<p>Jason, don&rsquo;t pretend you&rsquo;re not on the DM.</p>
<p>With Henry Belcaster?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes. Because he can&rsquo;t get through to you.</p>
<p>Is it okay for me to do this? And I&rsquo;m just like, go ahead. But then David&rsquo;s like, well,</p>
<p>actually, if we could change this and cut this word, and David&rsquo;s like, oh, you don&rsquo;t need any</p>
<p>editing. Just let the chip fall where they may. And then he&rsquo;s like Machiavellian back there,</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s Scorsese, changing every fucking frame of Henry Belcaster animated GIF made in San Paolo.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s a courtesy that Henry&rsquo;s running it by us. And you know, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Are you paying him?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Have you given him any compensation?</p>
<p>Okay. Well, no. Separately. Hold on.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get to his point. Here it comes.</p>
<p>Separately, I, after finding out that Henry and then his partner, Dylan, they&rsquo;ve got like a,</p>
<p>it is a business for them. Okay. So I said, listen, you guys are doing great work.</p>
<p>I think he does great work, by the way.</p>
<p>Yeah. I said, listen, why don&rsquo;t you guys start doing like product videos or videos for startups?</p>
<p>You can do the first one for a call in. So they&rsquo;re working on a video for that. I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to pay him like five grand. And if it&rsquo;s good, it&rsquo;ll be great for their business.</p>
<p>I want them to be successful.</p>
<p>No, but let&rsquo;s get to the point. Let&rsquo;s get to the point about, you know, reducing the conversation</p>
<p>to soundbites. And I want to respond to your point about not taking a position on things.</p>
<p>But, okay. So I feel like, first of all, within this group, there are hard takes within this</p>
<p>group of four people. So there are hard takes already in the show. And I think that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important in many debates and many of the topics we cover, there is more than one side to the story.</p>
<p>And we can have our formed opinion. But I think understanding what the other counterpoints and</p>
<p>counter arguments might be, is critical to get people to actually get to that opinion themselves,</p>
<p>as opposed to just telling them, this is the single point that you should believe,</p>
<p>nothing else matters. And so, I really think also many of these conversations are generally</p>
<p>two sides of the same coin. And more often than not, if you zoom out,</p>
<p>there are shared values, and many of the things that we all argue about,</p>
<p>broadly as society, and I&rsquo;m not trying to get too kind of philosophical here.</p>
<p>But if you kind of distill things down to different points of view with the same set of values,</p>
<p>or recognize that there are actually different values, you can come to a point that allows</p>
<p>people to think more progressively, and, you know, achieve a point of view on their own.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s critically missing today, broadly in society, that so much is all about</p>
<p>the good and the evil, good and bad, them and us. And we don&rsquo;t recognize that in moments where there</p>
<p>are shared values, we&rsquo;re just sitting on, you know, both sides of the same coin, or recognizing</p>
<p>that sometimes having different values doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make someone evil, it makes them</p>
<p>different. And that&rsquo;s why I try and kind of elevate the conversation a little bit and why I care so</p>
<p>much about this point, because I really think it&rsquo;s worth everyone getting a broader perspective on</p>
<p>everything that they&rsquo;re addressing, so that they can kind of go into things eyes wide open.</p>
<p>Now, sacks, I will say, on nearly everything, I actually fundamentally agree with you on many of</p>
<p>the points on the show. And so it&rsquo;s a little bit kind of, you know, gets a little echo chambery for</p>
<p>me to kind of say, I agree with sacks, like, that&rsquo;s it. I think it&rsquo;s also worth highlighting</p>
<p>why there are other points of view and why there are other arguments to be made out there. And for</p>
<p>me, I certainly have strongly held opinions. And, you know, I, I just don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s worth</p>
<p>getting to my opinion without taking the broader context of the conversation.</p>
<p>Did you notice that Friberg got a little emotional there?</p>
<p>I think it was a little emotional.</p>
<p>I was tuned out right now.</p>
<p>I was confused. I am on my iPhone.</p>
<p>Okay, let me let me try and find some.</p>
<p>Let me just ask you one question about this, because this is getting I mean, we&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>in the dugout right now. And I don&rsquo;t know if this is fabulously boring to people or not.</p>
<p>But do you frequently hold back your opinions on the show? Because you don&rsquo;t want to influence</p>
<p>people or you&rsquo;re afraid of being canceled or it having an adverse effect to your business</p>
<p>as it has to David&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a shit about that. No, I care more about the the path to an opinion.</p>
<p>Okay, and about the process?</p>
<p>No, and I care more about like, achieving the objective. So what I mean by that is,</p>
<p>if you just say this is my opinion, take it or leave it.</p>
<p>The other half that has a different opinion doesn&rsquo;t change their opinion.</p>
<p>If you if you zoom out for people, and you say, here&rsquo;s the broad set of facts and circumstances</p>
<p>and why different groups have different opinions, it ends up being a lot easier to actually get</p>
<p>people to see what may be the better path forward.</p>
<p>Listen, I want to get mad. You want to zoom out?</p>
<p>I got I have I have formed my opinion on many of these matters.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think stating my opinion changes anyone&rsquo;s mind. I think zooming out and giving people the</p>
<p>broader perspective so they can get there themselves is the way to kind of achieve change.</p>
<p>Okay, guys, enough. We&rsquo;re done. We&rsquo;re done with this topic. This is we can walk and chew gum at</p>
<p>the same time. Here&rsquo;s the point. I think that David, David Sachs has opinions. They are strong</p>
<p>opinions. But as I&rsquo;ve known him for 20 years, they&rsquo;re also weekly held and he changes his mind.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s powerful. David Friedberg, and I&rsquo;ve known you for a very long time as well</p>
<p>is great at explaining things. All of it is additive. So let&rsquo;s all just keep</p>
<p>Yeah, and of course, of course, you know, I support having a nuanced conversation that</p>
<p>gets all points of views out on the table. The point of the pod is not to, you know,</p>
<p>engage in sort of soundbites. It&rsquo;s just that what Henry creates is a result of a conversation. He</p>
<p>boils it down from 30 minutes into one minute. I think that performs a service for the audience,</p>
<p>maybe gets our takes out there in a way that, you know, that more people can hear them.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>But do you understand Friedberg&rsquo;s? I mean, I feel like I&rsquo;m I feel like I&rsquo;m a couples therapist here.</p>
<p>But do you understand Friedberg&rsquo;s position, David?</p>
<p>Yeah, he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want people to look at the podcast as reduction, a reduction down to a 60 second clip</p>
<p>or a 30 second clip of soundbites. He wants them to hear the full discourse.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, that&rsquo;s great. Well, then they can listen and do that. But I mean, realistically,</p>
<p>a lot of people don&rsquo;t have time to listen to the full 60 minutes that made sense to the clip.</p>
<p>But look, I think if there&rsquo;s a meta purpose to me being on the pod, I think it&rsquo;s to expand</p>
<p>the parameters of what people think they can say. Because actually, I agree with Friedberg that the</p>
<p>debate is shut down in a lot of contexts, and we want to open it back up. And, you know, you just</p>
<p>The Overton window needs to be reopened.</p>
<p>Yeah, like, look at what the whole Frank Slootman thing last week, where he puts out a pretty</p>
<p>mild statement about supporting diversity, but not to the point where it&rsquo;s it jeopardizes merit.</p>
<p>You know, there was a giant uproar over that he has to walk it back and issue an apology.</p>
<p>There was no discussion about the CEO of Snowflake.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s no there&rsquo;s no discussion or debate there. That was a shutting down of the</p>
<p>conversation because one side of the debate is basically engaging in moral indictments</p>
<p>against the other side. They&rsquo;re not really interested in having a serious debate about</p>
<p>the issues. I think that my meta purpose in speaking on the pod about all these issues</p>
<p>that I think are just common sense, you know, is just to kind of reopen the debate.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it is that merit versus diversity. And what is the point of a business? And should</p>
<p>the business be compromised or throttled? I think that&rsquo;s a very hard thing for people to say,</p>
<p>should we throttle this business? So that we have diversity? Should we slow down in order</p>
<p>to have more diversity? We can&rsquo;t find the right candidate, but we have a candidate here</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a white male, but God, you know, we already have seven or eight people on this.</p>
<p>Right. We&rsquo;ve talked about that. My point in giving that example is just to show how</p>
<p>shut down the debate is because the day after Slootman said, CEOs are having this conversation</p>
<p>in private. They&rsquo;re telling me this, and they&rsquo;re afraid to say it publicly. The very next day,</p>
<p>he walks it back and issues an apology, kind of buttressing his original point that people can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>say what they really think. So in my view, like part of the reason why the all-in pod is successful</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re getting issues on the table that people want to talk about, but feel they can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I think Freeberg brings a very valuable perspective to that conversation.</p>
<p>But my goal is kind of, if I have a meta goal, besides just expressing my point of view,</p>
<p>it is to expand, like you said, the Overton window.</p>
<p>All right. So speaking of the Overton window, New York City has voted for a, basically,</p>
<p>universally, both on the Democratic side and on the Republican side, for a tough on crime mayor,</p>
<p>70% of San Francisco feels worse about crime in a separate poll. And Eric Adams is the current</p>
<p>borough president and a former NYPD officer. And he is looking like he, because of this</p>
<p>stacked voting, which can take a little time to figure out who will become the mayor of New York,</p>
<p>but he has 32% of first place votes among 800,000 Democratic voters.</p>
<p>This guy is a really decent, centrist, moderate human being,</p>
<p>grew up where he was affected and touched by crime, decided to fight through that,</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t, you know, complaining, became a police officer, did that, you know, eventually borough</p>
<p>president has done that, runs for mayor, he goes on television, he gives an interview where they</p>
<p>say, what is your perspectives on stop and frisk? And the answer he gives was pretty specific,</p>
<p>which is that, you know, I believe in stopping and investigating potential crimes or some such,</p>
<p>right? Jason, you can probably find the exact</p>
<p>Well, I mean, having been in the, you know, a New York City Police Department family,</p>
<p>the and living in New York during stop and frisk, they left out a key word, it was stop question</p>
<p>frisk. So in high crime areas where there were a lot of shootings or guns, they would do</p>
<p>stop question and then possibly frisk. Obviously, all policing techniques can be</p>
<p>abused. But his feeling on it was when deployed correctly, stop in question is a great technique.</p>
<p>And I can tell you, when I lived in New York previously, 70 80% of people, including people</p>
<p>of color, including people from the toughest neighborhoods were in favor of this, this was</p>
<p>universally seen as a huge success at the time, because they were taking guns off the street</p>
<p>illegal guns constantly, because somebody would hop a turnstile. Or there&rsquo;d be people hanging out</p>
<p>on a street corner. And cops would come up and say, Hey, you&rsquo;re hanging out here at three in</p>
<p>the morning, what&rsquo;s going on? But the problem, the problem is that he gave a pretty reasonable answer.</p>
<p>Yes. And then they tried to cancel them.</p>
<p>Yep. And he would not allow himself to be canceled, which he went on the breakfast club,</p>
<p>and all kinds of other media outlets, and explained his position, and they couldn&rsquo;t cancel him.</p>
<p>Which is, I thought it was an incredible testament to what we&rsquo;re going through right now, which is</p>
<p>right now, nobody knows what to do to solve the things we feel. We&rsquo;ve tried the radical right</p>
<p>version of a candidate, it didn&rsquo;t work. We&rsquo;re now wondering to ourselves, while we have a custodian</p>
<p>in the White House, whether we go to the radical left, that&rsquo;s probably not going to work either.</p>
<p>Because unfortunately, San Francisco, I mean, unfortunately, it looks like the the</p>
<p>progressive left or the radical left is really, really judgmental. And none of these folks have</p>
<p>really done anything. And so they they are easy to complain. It&rsquo;s almost as if they know that they</p>
<p>what they want won&rsquo;t work. So they don&rsquo;t want anything else to work. And so they just want</p>
<p>everything to devolve into chaos. That&rsquo;s a shame. And so you know, people tried to literally lie</p>
<p>about what this guy said on television that was taped.</p>
<p>No, five times and clarify, I am not the way they were.</p>
<p>There were people Jason, I don&rsquo;t know if you saw that they are the video link that</p>
<p>there were people holding a press conference in front of his office,</p>
<p>literally screaming about stop and frisk when he never said stop and frisk. He said stop in</p>
<p>question is a reasonable strategy. If somebody if we think that there&rsquo;s the potential of a crime.</p>
<p>And the fact that people could not have that conversation, and had to go to basically,</p>
<p>this guy needs to either quit or be completely removed from his ability to run for mayor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s insanity.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you can people seem to have lost this ability to hold two conflicting ideas in their</p>
<p>mind. Which is, you could be for criminal justice reform, you could be against police violence.</p>
<p>And you could be for strong policing of violent crimes, and law and order. And what seems to be</p>
<p>happening in both cities, New York, San Francisco, and other places where crime is getting acute,</p>
<p>is that they, people are voting, here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s two other to be safer.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s another conflicting thoughts. You can believe that, you know,</p>
<p>Asians are awesome. But you can also believe that the coronavirus may have come from the Wuhan lab.</p>
<p>And believing the latter doesn&rsquo;t mean that you&rsquo;re supporting Asian hate. I&rsquo;m just going to put that</p>
<p>out there. Right? Okay, can I chime in on this? On this? On the on the Adams win? Because I think</p>
<p>this is this is huge news. Do you have your notes from Harry to make? Okay, go.</p>
<p>Look, I mean, Eric Adams is going to be the next mayor of New York City. And I think there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>three big takeaways from this. Number one, crime is the issue that I&rsquo;ve been saying on this pod</p>
<p>that it is for at least six months. It is the number one issue when people do not feel safe</p>
<p>in their homes and in their neighborhoods. You know, nothing else matters. And here comes</p>
<p>this really underdog candidate. He is despised by the sort of the progressive left and sort of the</p>
<p>elites of the Democratic Party. And he wins. I mean, he this is a huge underdog victory.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s only a former cop. He still carries a gun. I mean, he is packing. And that sent a message</p>
<p>to the electorate. I am going to be tough on crime. I&rsquo;m not standing for defunding the police</p>
<p>and deprosecution and decarceration, which are the hobby horses right now, the progressive left.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to protect you and the city and the voters. We&rsquo;re eating it up even in the Democratic</p>
<p>Party. So, number one, crime is the huge issue. And I think it&rsquo;s going to reverberate throughout</p>
<p>America for the next few years. Number two, it showed how out of touch these sort of progressives,</p>
<p>these and I&rsquo;d say predominantly white progressives are, how to touch they are with the constituencies</p>
<p>they claim to represent. You know, the mostly black and Latino neighborhoods who voted in large</p>
<p>numbers for Eric Adams were having none of this sort of elite woke progressive thinking around</p>
<p>decarceration, deprosecution. They are interested in real solutions for the problems that they see</p>
<p>not engaging in this sort of identity socialism. There&rsquo;s actually an interesting nugget in what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying, which I think you can broaden out, which is the radical left. I don&rsquo;t even call them</p>
<p>the progressive left, because that would mean they were making progress. And they&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just this radical left. They seem to be white, rich, affluent people. Yes. And they</p>
<p>seem to be super. And they&rsquo;re super guilty about something totally disconnected from what actual</p>
<p>people of color want. They&rsquo;re totally disconnected. Like they&rsquo;re speaking for a group of people who</p>
<p>maybe are like, that&rsquo;s not actually my position. I want my kids to be safe on the way to school.</p>
<p>I want guns off the street. If somebody, you know, and I think that I want to read the quote</p>
<p>that he had, because this is really important is to go to the source material, not the headlines</p>
<p>from, let&rsquo;s face it, the radical left is running these news publications, and they&rsquo;re determining</p>
<p>how they frame him. And here&rsquo;s the question from Vanity Fair. So you think there is a way to use</p>
<p>stop and frisk that isn&rsquo;t abusive? It&rsquo;s a reasonable question. And his answer? Well,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a word that&rsquo;s missing in there. It&rsquo;s called stop question and frisk. So two o&rsquo;clock</p>
<p>in the morning, you look out your door, you see a person standing in front of your house,</p>
<p>he places a gun in his waistband, you go to call the police, I hope that police officer responds,</p>
<p>he needs to be able to question that person. What are you doing with that gun? If we&rsquo;re telling</p>
<p>police officers, you can&rsquo;t question people, we are jeopardizing the safety of the city. I mean,</p>
<p>this is the most common sense logical framing of the discussion. It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>just pick a random person on the subway and say, empty your pockets and get up against the wall,</p>
<p>like the Gestapo, you know, somebody called something and you question people in the area.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen this in San Francisco that you&rsquo;ve got these, you know, social justice crusaders who</p>
<p>claim that they&rsquo;re helping minority communities, and you see an increase in the number of victims</p>
<p>from those communities. And what Eric Adams said is, listen, we can&rsquo;t just care about the cops</p>
<p>abusing their power, we also have to care about violence against these communities when it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>perpetrated by criminals. And people responded to that message. And I think the final point that I</p>
<p>think that the Eric Adams win represents is that Twitter is not&hellip; Or likely win, likely win.</p>
<p>Likely win, okay, fair enough, is that Twitter is not real life, okay? Eric Adams has 14,000</p>
<p>Twitter followers. Yang has 2 million, okay? Yang came in fourth, okay? And, you know,</p>
<p>Yang was sort of the darling of the, you know, sort of the Twitter elites, you know, he sort of,</p>
<p>I mean, look, when he first got into the Democratic primary for president, he was a</p>
<p>little bit of a breath of fresh air. But ultimately, he kind of adopted the generic progressive</p>
<p>positions on things that did not resonate with the people of New York. They wanted someone tough on</p>
<p>crime. And so, I think, you know, Eric Adams, he had another great quote, I think, on election</p>
<p>night, he said, social media does not pick a candidate, people on social security pick a</p>
<p>candidate, okay? Great line. And I mean, so here&rsquo;s the thing is, I think we all are distorted in our</p>
<p>thinking based on what this like very loud, but ultimately small number of voices on social media</p>
<p>says. And I think it&rsquo;s not just politicians. By the way, I mean, it&rsquo;s not just Eric Adams who won</p>
<p>because he ignored Twitter. I mean, Biden won because he ignored Twitter, right? I mean,</p>
<p>Biden was not on Twitter, and he was able to win the Democratic primary for president.</p>
<p>So, you know, I think there&rsquo;s a lesson here for politicians, which is ignore Twitter.</p>
<p>Moderates can win anything and everything as long as they show up and they do the work. But if you,</p>
<p>to your point, spend all your time trying to curate your Twitter image, all you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>do is validate a bunch of people that really, at the end of the day, are trying to punch up,</p>
<p>right? If you think about all the people that are spouting off, trying to cancel, trying to judge,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a great quote in many Drake songs, which is like, these people have more followers than</p>
<p>dollars. And what he&rsquo;s trying to say is like, you make them important when they don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>be important. Totally. Now do CEOs, right? You&rsquo;ve got CEOs of some of the biggest companies in the</p>
<p>world, like Tim Cook, like Frank Slootman, who are making their company policy based on what this</p>
<p>small number of loud voices on Twitter are saying. It&rsquo;s ridiculous. I mean, I think the Eric Adams</p>
<p>win is a watershed because it shows the emperor wears no clothes. These very loud, progressive,</p>
<p>woke voices ultimately do not have that many supporters. And all people have to do is stop</p>
<p>listening to them. Not when it goes into the privacy of the ballot box. You have a lot of</p>
<p>people, again, similar to what we saw in the Trump election in 2016, where all these people</p>
<p>quietly said, oh, I cannot support Trump. And then one in two people went into that ballot box and</p>
<p>said, fuck you to everybody. And this is the exact same thing that&rsquo;s playing out except the opposite,</p>
<p>which is now, if you are not completely progressive, at least in your posture and your</p>
<p>vocabulary, there&rsquo;s this threat of being canceled. And so you adopt this stuff almost to make your</p>
<p>life easy. But when push comes to shove, and we see it here in New York City, and we&rsquo;ll probably</p>
<p>see it all over the country, you get into the ballot box, you&rsquo;re going to go for somebody</p>
<p>moderate and reasonable that does the simple things that you want to get done.</p>
<p>And by the way, they tried to cancel the New York Times tried to cancel Andrew Yang,</p>
<p>because he had made very, he basically said, you know, that mentally ill men who are addicted to</p>
<p>drugs, basically, are punching people in the face. And, you know, we need to address that.</p>
<p>And the New York Times framed it really interestingly. And I&rsquo;ll read you the tweet,</p>
<p>watch Andrew Yang&rsquo;s response to a question about how he would handle mental health during</p>
<p>Wednesday&rsquo;s New York City mayoral debate, drew fire on social media from people who said it</p>
<p>lacked empathy or understanding. And when you look at that framing, he said how he would handle mental</p>
<p>health. He wasn&rsquo;t talking about mental health, generally and broadly. He was talking about</p>
<p>people suffering from mental health on the streets who were homeless who are addicted to drugs and</p>
<p>who punch people on the face, right massive subset. Yeah, but they framed this to attack</p>
<p>them. Let me just finish the other way they framed it. It drew fire on social media.</p>
<p>So instead of saying this person said this, they literally the New York Times is trying to get</p>
<p>Andrew Yang canceled and to get more people to subscribe by being part of the woke mob.</p>
<p>Yes, literally their Twitter handle does it he I could find 10 times as many people who said,</p>
<p>yeah, we can&rsquo;t have people who are mentally ill and violent on the street punching people.</p>
<p>It was Andrew Yang&rsquo;s. It was Andrew Yang&rsquo;s single best moment of the campaign</p>
<p>is he talked honestly about the risk to the public of mentally ill people living on the streets and</p>
<p>attacking people. It was his single best moment. The reason he did it is because he saw the</p>
<p>traction that Eric Adams was getting on the safety issue. And if Yang had done that from</p>
<p>the beginning of the campaign, he might be the next mayor. Yeah, let me let me read this.</p>
<p>He was he was Yang cared too much. Ultimately, his Achilles heel was caring too much about the</p>
<p>very online voices on Twitter, like the New York Times. And we&rsquo;ve just seen that Eric Adams has</p>
<p>proved us all a house of cards. Nobody really cares what they think. Here&rsquo;s the here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>quote from Eric Adams. If the Democratic Party fails to recognize what we did here in New York,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to have a problem in the midterm elections, and they&rsquo;re going to have a problem</p>
<p>in the presidential election. The Brooklyn Borough President said America is saying,</p>
<p>we want to have justice and safety and end inequality. And we don&rsquo;t want fancy candidates.</p>
<p>We want candidates. Their nails are not polished. They have calluses on their hands,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re blue collar people, common sense, common sense, return to common sense.</p>
<p>Freeberg, I had CCG on this thread where somebody said they found missing sequencing of the COVID</p>
<p>genes that were submitted to a database. Did you have a chance to review that at all?</p>
<p>I did. And since you sent that, it&rsquo;s become a little bit of a story. A lot of people have</p>
<p>kind of picked it up and followed up on it, because it did ignite quite a bit of interest.</p>
<p>So, the story is a guy named Jesse Bloom, who&rsquo;s a researcher at the Hutchinson Cancer Center in</p>
<p>Seattle, and has been studying, you know, COVID as a lot of scientists have kind of</p>
<p>shifted their attention over the past year, but has a background in virology.</p>
<p>He was trying to pull some early genomic samples that may have been taken from patients early in</p>
<p>China. So, what this means is, you know, when patients kind of, in the early days were emerging</p>
<p>as potentially having SARS-CoV-2, they were swabbing them, and then doing a genomic read</p>
<p>of the RNA they find from the virus in that swab. And around the world, a lot of scientists</p>
<p>contribute to this openly available genomic database. And they contribute their whole</p>
<p>genome samples when they run studies and so on. So, other scientists can use it in the future</p>
<p>for research. And what this guy found was that there were a few dozen of these samples</p>
<p>that had been on this genomics database that were now missing. And they had been pulled down.</p>
<p>And using a little technical sleuthing, he realized they had been pulled down from the directory,</p>
<p>but the raw genomic sample read data was still available on the Google Cloud. So,</p>
<p>he used the Google Cloud API to pull that actual data down from the servers,</p>
<p>and then ran a study on it. And it turns out that the interesting kind of intrigue around this story</p>
<p>is why did that data get deleted? Who deleted it? And it turns out the only way it gets deleted</p>
<p>is if the original kind of authors go in and make a request to have it removed. And these</p>
<p>were some random scientists in China who had submitted this data. And so, in the days following</p>
<p>this publication of this guy, so, this guy published this on a preprint server called</p>
<p>bioRxiv. So, it&rsquo;s not a peer reviewed journal. It basically is a place for bioRxiv is a place where</p>
<p>biology scientists can submit early versions of their research papers or to get a new finding out</p>
<p>really quickly. And then the world can kind of study it. And you don&rsquo;t have to wait for the</p>
<p>journalistic kind of cycle of getting things approved, which is common now. And so, he put</p>
<p>this thing out there. And everyone&rsquo;s kind of questioning, well, okay, where did these samples</p>
<p>go? It turns out that these Chinese scientists had submitted them. And now it has shown or it</p>
<p>has come out that apparently some US officials made the request to have it taken down after</p>
<p>being asked to do so by some Chinese officials to pull this data down. And so, there&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>weird kind of intrigue going on right now around this whole story. Now, so, that&rsquo;s kind of thread</p>
<p>number one, which is why was this request made to pull this data down? What was the motivation,</p>
<p>etc? Thread number two is what does the data show us? And what the data shows us, unfortunately,</p>
<p>is a little bit inconclusive. So, a guy named Trevor Bedford just put out a tweet earlier today</p>
<p>analyzing this. He&rsquo;s a world class virologist, also worked at the French Hutchinson Center</p>
<p>in Seattle. And he basically highlights that in the early days of the SARS-CoV-2 explosion in China,</p>
<p>you can really identify from a genomic variant perspective, two lineages of the virus. That</p>
<p>means, you know, we&rsquo;re trying to get back to origin or patient zero. And it turns out there</p>
<p>were kind of like these two families of the virus that were emerging. And even with that new data,</p>
<p>you could kind of reconstruct the family tree in such a way that the Wuhan meat market could have</p>
<p>been the origin, meaning the root virus could have come out of that Wuhan market, or the Wuhan</p>
<p>meat market could have been one of the two branches of the tree that emerged early on.</p>
<p>So, there may have been an even earlier origin. And Wuhan market was just one place where it</p>
<p>started to take off. So, you know, he said, look, he still thinks that it&rsquo;s about a 50-50,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s no clear evidence one way or the other based on these newly uncovered samples.</p>
<p>But, you know, there is still this question of does the Wuhan market kind of paint the patient</p>
<p>zero story? Or is it one of the places where the explosion happened and patient zero was,</p>
<p>in fact, much earlier than Wuhan market? I will say, a couple episodes ago, I kind of made a</p>
<p>comment, you know, with respect to the origin of this virus that I don&rsquo;t know, don&rsquo;t care. And I</p>
<p>just want to clarify, because I know that some people kind of reached out to me about that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really, my intention with that statement was that this was really meant to be,</p>
<p>I think, a little bit more of a canary in a coal mine for us broadly about, you know, hey,</p>
<p>what we should be looking forward to is what&rsquo;s next, not just about what happened in the past.</p>
<p>This has happened already. Let&rsquo;s move on to the next thing is what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>not being callous that it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I think what&rsquo;s more important is that we need to get prepared for how do</p>
<p>we prevent these things happening in the future? And what are the, you know, the key kind of</p>
<p>checkpoints we have around us in the future, because one thing I am most concerned about</p>
<p>is a huge step back, but I&rsquo;m concerned about our normalization of cancel, you know, we kind of have</p>
<p>started to cancel people, but we&rsquo;ve also, you know, these shutdowns have been normalized.</p>
<p>And the normalization where shutdown is the response to an emerging variant or emerging</p>
<p>virus is really scary. Because, you know, how is society going to function properly when there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be a proliferation of these viruses, a proliferation of risks, with new technologies</p>
<p>being made available to us, and then shutting down becomes our immediate response.</p>
<p>Well, how do you feel about shutting down borders, Friedberg as the first course of action,</p>
<p>if everybody in unison had shut down the borders in February, and said,</p>
<p>no intercountry travel, you know, it would have obviously been devastating for the airlines,</p>
<p>but it might have stopped the pandemic in its tracks.</p>
<p>There was no way to stop the pandemic. Once the genies out of the bottle, the genies out of the</p>
<p>bottle. And we saw this in states that had lockdowns and states that didn&rsquo;t have lockdowns</p>
<p>where we saw equivalent, but why wasn&rsquo;t Taiwan and Australia and those kind of places that are</p>
<p>islands that lockdown? Why were they spared? I don&rsquo;t know if you can really say that they</p>
<p>were spared. And I don&rsquo;t know if you can really say that people are happy with the life that they</p>
<p>led for that year, right? I think what we need to solve for is how do we have these vaccines come</p>
<p>to market much faster, and be much more variable in their efficaciousness, because we are going to</p>
<p>have a lot more of these kind of emerging variants over the next couple of years with SARS-CoV-2,</p>
<p>but also with potentially engineered bugs that we need to be careful about.</p>
<p>Question for Chamath and Sachs then, in Friedberg&rsquo;s sort of analysis there,</p>
<p>and what was explained on the web about the these new sequences, the US was allegedly involved in</p>
<p>taking this down with the Chinese. If the USA and I&rsquo;m just creating a hypothesis here just to do a</p>
<p>little game theory. If the US was allowing China to take this down, what would the game theory be?</p>
<p>If the US was involved in, dare I say a cover up, or being opaque, like the Chinese have already</p>
<p>been proven to be? Why would the US do that, Chamath? What would be the possible theories and</p>
<p>Sachs? Why did why did the NBA shut down Daryl Morey? But that may not be that made a sorry,</p>
<p>that may not be national policy, Jake. All right. So like a scientist, an American scientist or an</p>
<p>American official, right, could have made that request. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that it was a</p>
<p>conspiratorial process to remove this stuff. Yeah, no, I want to jump the gun. I want to</p>
<p>jump the fence and say, if in fact, the some US people were involved, so to your point, it could</p>
<p>be an individual covering it up, or it could be an organization in America, or it could be,</p>
<p>you know, some set of organizations, but Sachs, you wanted to?</p>
<p>Well, look, I don&rsquo;t believe the wet market theory, precisely because there is a cover up. I mean,</p>
<p>the wet market theory was the official CCP who party line about where the virus came from. If</p>
<p>that was the case, why would they just throw open the gates to investigators, let them go into the</p>
<p>Wuhan Institute of virology? You know, why? Why all the cover up? Why? And when they shut down</p>
<p>all wet markets? Maybe, I mean, but I mean, the logical conclusion, but why? Why obstruct the</p>
<p>investigation? Why ask these American researchers to delete these sequences of DNA or whatever?</p>
<p>And in terms of why would the researchers do it? Because they were asked to and they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got a relationship. Why would Americans be if in fact, they were?</p>
<p>Why is the WHO been carrying water for the Chinese government?</p>
<p>Because they get their paycheck from them.</p>
<p>No, because I think the WHO is stupid. I mean, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;ve all got all these, you know, institutional incentives. They all work together.</p>
<p>And, you know, there&rsquo;s money involved, there&rsquo;s sort of relationships involved,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s bureaucracy involved.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a level of incompetence.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it could be incompetence. Could it also not be that we funded that laboratory? In some way,</p>
<p>right? We had given some money towards it. That&rsquo;s, I think, established.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a if I if look, I am a better so</p>
<p>on our face, if they were, in fact, doing this, so we don&rsquo;t want to look bad, or we don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to be in conflict with them. Because I think Americans in the West might demand we be in</p>
<p>conflict with China.</p>
<p>No, I think it&rsquo;s I think it&rsquo;s what Friedberg said, which is like, look, what seemingly a</p>
<p>low level request is made to basically delete an entry in a table, you do it, you know,</p>
<p>not thinking anything of it. It, I think it&rsquo;s pretty clear that this was something that leaked</p>
<p>out of that lab. The thing that we will never ever know is how and why, and whether it was</p>
<p>purely accidental or something more nefarious than that. And I think this is why to Friedberg&rsquo;s</p>
<p>point, we just have to put a pin in all of that, and move on and try to figure out a way where we</p>
<p>set ourselves up so that the next time, for example, the like, you know, we hear about the</p>
<p>delta variant. Now, we&rsquo;re going to hear about other variants in the fall, it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>a tough winter. We cannot shut down. Yeah.</p>
<p>What happened here in order to inform our plan for the future. So I think to your point,</p>
<p>walking and chewing gum at the same time. Why can&rsquo;t we do both?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I mean, think about it if the so I&rsquo;ve never I&rsquo;ve never heard anyone seriously</p>
<p>argue that the lab leak was intentional. I mean, I think because that would have posed,</p>
<p>I think, a risk to China itself. But but let&rsquo;s say let&rsquo;s say it was an accidental lab leak.</p>
<p>What that suggests is look, the Chinese knew everything about this virus for months,</p>
<p>while we were all here pulling out our hair trying to figure this thing out. What is it?</p>
<p>Who does it affect? You know, what are the risks? We&rsquo;re all having these debates in the United</p>
<p>States and trying to get to the bottom of this thing. And they knew everything about it. And</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t telling us about freeberg. I mean, the I think I think I read this somewhere. But</p>
<p>Moderna had characterized the vaccine 48 hours after getting an email of the DNA sequence of</p>
<p>the anyone can do that. Yeah, within within 40. So this was done in January, as soon as we got</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t make it to David&rsquo;s point. Why don&rsquo;t they tell us how they made it?</p>
<p>months to understand the pathology of the virus, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s not what matters. J kal. You can read the code. It&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>readable. You can read the code within a day. And then you can pick the area that the spike</p>
<p>protein, which we already knew about. And you can say, let&rsquo;s go build some, you know, target</p>
<p>how they got there doesn&rsquo;t matter is what you&rsquo;re saying freeberg how they how they created it.</p>
<p>How they got to the Chinese, you&rsquo;re saying you&rsquo;re asking how the Chinese edited the virus in a lab?</p>
<p>Is that what you&rsquo;re saying? Yeah, how they was just like a three year project? Is this the 17th</p>
<p>version they worked on or the second? You know, like, there&rsquo;s so many things, Jason, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>speaking about, you&rsquo;re characterizing this as if it was a designed weapon. Is that what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying? Well, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m saying it was designed and not as a weapon. But they were doing what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>evolutionary function research. But gain of function means that it there was a gain of</p>
<p>function in plain English freeberg. So when they say biology in virology, they&rsquo;re going to study</p>
<p>what changes in the genome might do to biology to an animal to a biological system. And that study</p>
<p>gives them insights into how a virus may evolve, or how certain parts of a virus may affect humans</p>
<p>ultimately in different ways. And so understanding viruses and really important when you&rsquo;re studying</p>
<p>viruses is you want to understand where they&rsquo;re headed, not just where they&rsquo;re coming from.</p>
<p>And so to understand where they&rsquo;re headed, you may make genomic changes and study how those</p>
<p>genomic changes affect biology enhanced. Can I use the word enhanced or evolved,</p>
<p>you could say evolved, you could say enhanced, you could say engineered, but, but very much,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about understanding where the changes in the proteins in the virus can affect biology in</p>
<p>different ways in the future, so that we can better understand, you know, what these viruses</p>
<p>are capable of and prepare ourselves. We found out we found out the implications of COVID-19.</p>
<p>And thank God we didn&rsquo;t have to find it out for 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 1098. You know what</p>
<p>I mean? Like, yes. So that&rsquo;s my point, Friedberg, would it not be helpful to open kimono look at</p>
<p>every single enhancement they made, and what the results of those were, like, they did something</p>
<p>in that lab for the last couple of years, who&rsquo;s got that information? They knew the name is the</p>
<p>same. What this database thing represents is look, there was a cover up here, and that cover</p>
<p>up has fingerprints, and the information is leaking out. And we are seeing more evidence</p>
<p>and more information is going to come out. I actually disagree with you guys that we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to learn more about what happened. We&rsquo;re going to learn a lot more. We&rsquo;re going to learn</p>
<p>a lot more. And it&rsquo;s going to get worse and worse. It&rsquo;s going to be but sacks, where does it head?</p>
<p>So like, let&rsquo;s say we discover, that was my original question. Let&rsquo;s say we discover that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an accidental lab leak out of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a scientist got infected,</p>
<p>left the lab gave it to her boyfriend, people spread it in the street suddenly became a whole</p>
<p>pandemic. What do we do? What do you think the response is? Do you think Americans basically now</p>
<p>impose sanctions on China and we and we lead to a Cold War? Like where&rsquo;s this all headed?</p>
<p>What are the motivating principles of politicians who are going to respond as that comes out?</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s what I want to know.</p>
<p>Okay, number one, I&rsquo;ve said before, we got to reassure the whole pharmaceutical industry</p>
<p>cannot be dependent on China for our pharmaceutical supply chain or antibiotics or PPE. That is</p>
<p>insane. Second of all, I mean, we got to be more realistic about the nature of the regime</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re dealing with. They knew everything about this virus for months while we were trying</p>
<p>to figure it out. Where does it take us? Like, let&rsquo;s say we find out that to be true.</p>
<p>What happens now decoupling decoupling here. And here&rsquo;s another thing that I think needs to happen,</p>
<p>which is that to cover, but I guess that&rsquo;s sorry, come off one sec, but doesn&rsquo;t decoupling happen</p>
<p>either way? Like, why do we need all this? Because there is such a motivating principle on</p>
<p>on both sides of the aisle to decouple from China. And there is a motivating principle.</p>
<p>There is a reason to not decouple. It&rsquo;s called money. There is a group of elites who do not</p>
<p>want the decoupling to happen. No, no, no MBA to iPhones. No, the NBA and Disney do not want</p>
<p>to decouple. They want to integrate these two societies so that we can make money. I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>that decoupling is my theory of what people are scared of. No, okay. People are scared of a</p>
<p>decoupling. I just want to say two things. I don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s like a group of elites that</p>
<p>want that to happen necessarily, because I think that their lives are complicated. And what they</p>
<p>would love to have, I think, is actually two end markets. You have to remember, if you go from one</p>
<p>global market to a duopoly market, and you&rsquo;re a seller of services, you actually have more pricing</p>
<p>power in a duopoly than you do in a monopoly into a monopoly. So, you know, if you&rsquo;re Disney,</p>
<p>theoretically, and you have the ability to differentially price two different pieces of</p>
<p>content, you&rsquo;re going to do that. So I tend to think, in general, it&rsquo;s better for economic systems</p>
<p>to have this bifurcation. So the I just want to go back to the thing that I wanted to</p>
<p>bifurcation, you&rsquo;re saying two different markets, but what if there is,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re going to sanction, we&rsquo;re not going to send Disney movies, or they&rsquo;re not going to let</p>
<p>Disney and NBA and like, they don&rsquo;t let Google and Twitter in, or iPhones are not going to be</p>
<p>made there. And Apple&rsquo;s going to start making iPhones in Vietnam and Pakistan and Sri Lanka,</p>
<p>I actually think what happens is it accelerates democracy. Because again, you have an enormously</p>
<p>difficult and thorny issue inside of China, which is they have a cataclysmic demographic</p>
<p>bombshell going on. Yep, they have we have the average age in China versus the average age in</p>
<p>the United States is now the same. Yep, which is an unbelievable thing, because China was</p>
<p>China was 15 or 20 years younger in the early 90s, when all of this offshoring started to happen in</p>
<p>full scale. By the end of 21, by the end of this century, China&rsquo;s population, I think,</p>
<p>is projected to shrink to about 700 million people. So they are in a hugely difficult</p>
<p>demographic situation where there&rsquo;s no young people, people are getting older and older and</p>
<p>older. And so there&rsquo;s just going to be a lot of upheaval. You just saw people cost a lot of money</p>
<p>to much, much more money as Japan has learned China just, you know, relax their one child policy</p>
<p>to two, then within a month, they relax their two child policy to three. And they&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>paying people to have kids. I mean, we have tax incentives. Well, and now they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>floating a policy which has unlimited kids. Okay, so so that&rsquo;s why you can I just, I just want to</p>
<p>go back to what one of the practical things we can do coming out of Wuhan is all this new data comes</p>
<p>out is instead of vilifying China, or trying to enter some Cold War, which is stupid, we should</p>
<p>just go and reshore everything as Zach suggested. One thing that you can say is, wherever there is</p>
<p>this kind of research happening in the world, every single variant needs to go to some basically</p>
<p>open source repository that virologists all around the world can basically watch what&rsquo;s happening in</p>
<p>lockstep. Maybe so that well, right, I mean, what was going on here, then? Yeah, they deleted it.</p>
<p>It was deleted.</p>
<p>What are they doing?</p>
<p>That is exactly the principle. And that is exactly what goes on within the academic and research</p>
<p>communities worldwide. There&rsquo;s very open and cooperative dialogue with academics around the</p>
<p>world about these matters. And generally, that is absolutely true in the way things are done,</p>
<p>because scientists don&rsquo;t care about politics. They care about, you know, human health and progress.</p>
<p>Answer this question, please. Is every single variant of COVID that led up to COVID-19,</p>
<p>well characterized and well understood by a broad class of scientists and virologists all over the</p>
<p>world? Or? Yeah. Or a small subset of people, the plurality of which were working in the Wuhan lab</p>
<p>for virology, we didn&rsquo;t know that the argument goes, you don&rsquo;t know that you have SARS Co v2</p>
<p>in those early days. And so you see some people getting sick, and then suddenly you put your head</p>
<p>up and you&rsquo;re like, wait a second, what&rsquo;s going on here? That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m asking. Well, my point</p>
<p>is, you&rsquo;re not you&rsquo;re not running a genomic sequencing on all those people in those early</p>
<p>days. No, no, I&rsquo;m asking something else. You have this original virus that you&rsquo;ve been testing and</p>
<p>mutating and, you know, reprogramming your testing, you&rsquo;re basically doing a massive</p>
<p>Monte Carlo simulation on an original virus. Are all the intermediate instantiations of that virus</p>
<p>well characterized? Okay, that&rsquo;s my point. Yeah, okay. If they were publicly available,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t that be super dangerous? Also, also, by the way, like, wouldn&rsquo;t it make sense? And if you</p>
<p>were doing these iterations of these viruses, that that the DNA sequences should go to places</p>
<p>like Pfizer and Moderna, where you are mandated to create vaccines just in case? Well, we are</p>
<p>going to enter a stage here in the next decade, where we will have vaccine printers around the</p>
<p>world, they&rsquo;re going to be small bioreactors, you&rsquo;re going to be able to effectively ship code</p>
<p>to them, they&rsquo;re going to print vaccines, there&rsquo;s several companies pursuing this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna go to a limit. I like your idea, though. I&rsquo;m just gonna say this system</p>
<p>is immature, naive and inefficient. And I think that&rsquo;s something that we can fix.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why what matters most, in my opinion, and based on the comments I made a few episodes ago,</p>
<p>is that we need to focus on how to get there versus trying to trace back the origins. Because</p>
<p>I think honestly, tracing back the origins is just going to put kindling on a fire that&rsquo;s already</p>
<p>burning. And so my this, this has been my point about this whole, like, you know, blame China,</p>
<p>we want to get to a point where we can quote unquote, blame China for this. But the decoupling</p>
<p>in the onshore, there is already enough motivation there. And there&rsquo;s already on both sides of the</p>
<p>aisle, there&rsquo;s already kind of an obvious trajectory that we&rsquo;re headed this way. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not sure this is a catalyst, maybe, or it&rsquo;s a little bit more kindling, we&rsquo;re already headed</p>
<p>there. And it doesn&rsquo;t actually answer our forward looking question, which is how do we secure our</p>
<p>future? And how we secure our future is really where technology and industry and some of these</p>
<p>freeburg, let me let me build on Chamath idea. What if the mRNA vaccine creation, and the research</p>
<p>laboratory were the same facility, and you had a cross disciplinary approach,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re making stuff, and then they&rsquo;re curing it next door in real time so that they</p>
<p>can trade notes? Why would that be a terrible idea? It seems like a brilliant idea.</p>
<p>And you could just, you could just transfer the data from the research and print the vaccines</p>
<p>with the people that are really good at making vaccine. Right? You know, you don&rsquo;t need to have</p>
<p>an intricate understanding of the biology to actually be effective at making vaccines, right?</p>
<p>No, but isn&rsquo;t there something about scientists who are cross disciplinary sharing space and having</p>
<p>collisions building relationships? Isn&rsquo;t that part of the science process that&rsquo;s worked over the last</p>
<p>couple years, you talk about how in synthetic biology and all this you want the mathematicians,</p>
<p>computer programmers, you know, and the biologists in the same area and the chemists</p>
<p>resolving to a world where we have very cheap, very fast and distributed production of vaccines</p>
<p>is an engineering problem. And the engineering work is what is kind of being undertaken now by</p>
<p>several companies and will be fueled by this, this new bill that Biden&rsquo;s trying to get past</p>
<p>this infrastructure bill is a ton of money in there for it. And as that happens, that engineering</p>
<p>process is effectively think about them like printers, and they can take code. And that code</p>
<p>allows the printer to now print whatever you want to print, the question of what you want to print</p>
<p>is going to be determined by the research that&rsquo;s being done over here, which is okay,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re discovering, here&rsquo;s what we should print, here&rsquo;s what we should protect</p>
<p>against and why. But I think that there&rsquo;s a separate engineering exercise was, you know,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s build this distributed production system. I&rsquo;m going to go on a limb and say these labs are</p>
<p>immature, naive, and unsophisticated in the checks and balances that exist. And I think we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen that and we need to fix it. And you need to do something more than just have a bunch of</p>
<p>folks that are focused on science going ham in whatever way they want.</p>
<p>All right. So just to wrap sacks, anything else on this as we put a cherry on it?</p>
<p>Well, I just you asked the question, what do we do about China? I think that is a question.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a generational question. We&rsquo;re going to be asking that for decades. This is an area</p>
<p>where we need Friedbergian nuance because it&rsquo;s something that we&rsquo;re going to have to navigate</p>
<p>as a country for decades. A really good book about this is the Thucydides Trap</p>
<p>by Graham Allison, who&rsquo;s a Harvard professor. And he discusses different strategies we can take.</p>
<p>He quotes Lee Kuan Yew, who is the president of Singapore, who has a great quote about this.</p>
<p>Lee Kuan Yew said that the size of China&rsquo;s displacement of the world balance</p>
<p>is such that the world must find a new balance. It is not possible to pretend that this is just</p>
<p>another big player. This is the biggest player in the history of the world. That was the Lee</p>
<p>Kuan Yew quote. So we were dealing with this issue even before COVID, but I do think that</p>
<p>COVID has unmasked this regime a little bit and caused people across both sides of the spectrum</p>
<p>to look at this regime, I think, more realistically. All right. So in somewhat related</p>
<p>news, Apple obviously building all their phones over there and now having servers and data over</p>
<p>there has led to a lot of scrutiny of big tech. But the more pressing issue is the antitrust bills</p>
<p>that seem to be fast tracked. On Wednesday, US House Judiciary Committee discussed six</p>
<p>proposed antitrust bills. One bill sponsored by a Democrat from Rhode Island would call for Apple</p>
<p>to allow third party app stores, seems reasonable, and provide iPhone technologies to third party</p>
<p>software makers. So I think that means maybe opening up iMessage, which would be delightful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what they mean there. And so Apple and Tim Cook is in a panic,</p>
<p>he apparently called Nancy Pelosi and said, Can you pump the brakes?</p>
<p>Just to give you an idea of what&rsquo;s going on here. Apple&rsquo;s revenue, even though it&rsquo;s a small</p>
<p>percentage of just 10% of their $274 billion in 2020 revenue, it&rsquo;s obviously pure profit,</p>
<p>profit margins got to be in the notes here, it says 75%. But I would think it&rsquo;s even more</p>
<p>clearly services and the app store inside of Apple is I think, analogous to the AWS for Amazon</p>
<p>is money printing machine that&rsquo;s growing really fast. What do we think about Apple being forced</p>
<p>to put other app stores on their phones, just like you can on your Android phone?</p>
<p>I support it. I&rsquo;ve been blue pilled on this issue. Actually, that&rsquo;s what the that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>the commenters on of our the all in fans have said is that why sacks taking blue pills on this issue.</p>
<p>And and look, the reality is because I&rsquo;m not in the business of, of helping $2 trillion</p>
<p>market cap companies. I&rsquo;m in the underdog business. I&rsquo;m in the business of helping</p>
<p>the entrepreneur get started with a new company. And the fact of the matter is,</p>
<p>is that Apple has the market power, the same market power greater than Microsoft did in its</p>
<p>heyday with the Windows monopoly. They are total gatekeepers of what applications can be built on</p>
<p>these iOS devices. Windows Windows, you could windows was open. It was open. I mean, it was</p>
<p>open. They didn&rsquo;t have an app store. Right. So this this proposal by</p>
<p>right. So this proposal by representative Sicily and the Democrat from Rhode Island</p>
<p>would allow this side loading, it would basically loosen the grip that Apple has over the apps that</p>
<p>can be loaded onto Apple devices, it would at least, you know, create some degree some potential</p>
<p>tremendous competition. And it&rsquo;s very easy to execute. Go ahead, Jamal.</p>
<p>I think you said it really well, I am also in the underdog business. So I think the,</p>
<p>the faster they&rsquo;ve ran this thing through the better off it&rsquo;ll be. The thing that is important</p>
<p>to recognize is that Apple will make this argument that, well, look, there&rsquo;s always Android. And also</p>
<p>look, there&rsquo;s the open web. And that&rsquo;s structurally not true for a couple of reasons. The overwhelming</p>
<p>amount of development, at least in Silicon Valley, and broadly speaking in tech starts on the iPhone.</p>
<p>Sure. And it&rsquo;s only then as an afterthought, almost, I mean, you have to remember, it took</p>
<p>Snapchat three or four years of being a public company before they actually had a reasonable</p>
<p>Android app. Right. And so Android is has always been sort of the low ARPU afterthought, even</p>
<p>though it has meaningfully more users, they&rsquo;re just not average revenue per user. And so exactly.</p>
<p>And so, you know, it&rsquo;s kind of a baseless argument, the overwhelming revenue, the North</p>
<p>Star for developers, where all of the venture capital money goes into is the funding and</p>
<p>developing iOS apps. And in that worldview, iOS is a complete monopoly. And breaking up the ability</p>
<p>for them to basically dictate a 30% take rate, and also loosening the technical guardrails,</p>
<p>I think is a huge step forward. There&rsquo;s only one thing that I would say, however,</p>
<p>Apple has done an incredible job with privacy, locking down the phone,</p>
<p>sandboxing instances, and we&rsquo;ll have to find some technical alternative to fortifying.</p>
<p>Oh, no, actually, they don&rsquo;t come up. Actually, I think what they do is when you go to your</p>
<p>settings, you say unlock iPhone, you now are not protected, Apple is not responsible,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve decided to sideload stuff. And it&rsquo;s basically like putting your your phone into</p>
<p>jailbreak or dev mode, where they are not going to support you. That&rsquo;s the way I think Apple should</p>
<p>execute it is that would be like they&rsquo;re, you know, if you want to load anything you want,</p>
<p>when you get viruses, and your privacy gets hacked, it&rsquo;s not on us, you&rsquo;ve just essentially,</p>
<p>all the we have one warranty for people who are not jailbroken and sideloaded,</p>
<p>and one warranty for people who decide to jailbreak their phones.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s incredible to me the other the other point on this is how quickly these guys</p>
<p>pass this bill, and actually, actually, all six, and then how reasonably well they were written.</p>
<p>I mean, this is one topic where sometimes, you know, politicians can really kind of get it wrong,</p>
<p>or they can get lobbied in one way or the other. And these bills come out, they don&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>I mean, if you have to remember where how far we&rsquo;ve come, you know, wasn&rsquo;t the first antitrust</p>
<p>thing, where like some guy as Zuck a question about like a Model T Ford or something. I mean,</p>
<p>it was just so stupid. They were so dumb. And they&rsquo;ve gone from there to this is really incredible</p>
<p>how fast they&rsquo;ve caught up. I think this is just a terrible precedent. And I, I think if you guys</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t going to make money by weakening Apple and Alphabet, you guys put your free market hats on,</p>
<p>you kind of acknowledge that this is just a we&rsquo;re not angel investors.</p>
<p>We did not do the series A of either of those companies, Friedberg.</p>
<p>Yeah, I recognize that. And I think if you guys had a bunch of shares in Alphabet,</p>
<p>or Amazon or Apple, your your opinion would be a little bit different. But</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just observing exactly what I&rsquo;ve shared. I&rsquo;ve shares in Amazon and Facebook.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, look, I think in this particular case, he&rsquo;s in the process of selling.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, if Apple and Alphabet didn&rsquo;t make incredible products for consumers</p>
<p>and focus on consumer happiness, they wouldn&rsquo;t be as successful as they are.</p>
<p>And much of if you remember kind of the early days of the Apple App Store</p>
<p>ideology, it was about curating apps and curating the quality of those apps so that the quality of</p>
<p>the overall iPhone experience would be superior to anything else out there and consumers would</p>
<p>love it. It wasn&rsquo;t about blocking out competitors and blocking out rivals and blocking out other</p>
<p>platforms. It was about making something that consumers would absolutely love.</p>
<p>Incorrect.</p>
<p>And the same I think is true.</p>
<p>Incorrect, Friedberg. They blocked third party bookstores and book readers. They blocked browsers.</p>
<p>They want to tell the experience.</p>
<p>VLC and open source players. They did that because they wanted you to use their own products.</p>
<p>They set standards on the App Store. And as long as you met those standards,</p>
<p>those apps got in there. So YouTube&rsquo;s in there. Google Chrome is in there. You know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got Chrome installed on my iPhone. I think it&rsquo;s a better browser.</p>
<p>It took them years, Friedberg.</p>
<p>Years. And they realized they had to give that up. They had to give up the browser.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s what consumers wanted.</p>
<p>Because they knew it put a target on their back.</p>
<p>No, the only reason that Chrome is there is because</p>
<p>of the amount of money that Google pays Apple for search.</p>
<p>Yeah, I look.</p>
<p>And that was a quid pro quo in that search deal.</p>
<p>I will bet you dollars to donuts that that&rsquo;s the only reason.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think Apple is that dumb. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that these guys recognize that if</p>
<p>consumers want something, they better give it to them. And if consumers wanted a bunch of</p>
<p>shitty apps on the phone that didn&rsquo;t work and broke down all the time.</p>
<p>You will then go through the process of jailbreak. Should you be able to jailbreak</p>
<p>your phone and hack it, Friedberg?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t think that I should be telling Apple how to make their friggin hardware.</p>
<p>They should make their hardware and I as a consumer in the free market should decide</p>
<p>if I want to buy it or not. And if I want to</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a free market. It&rsquo;s a monopoly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a duopoly.</p>
<p>I can go buy a friggin Samsung or I don&rsquo;t know if HTC still makes phones or, you know,</p>
<p>Nokia or Blackberry. I guess these guys are all dead because their products suck.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, if there&rsquo;s an alternative out there, I will buy it.</p>
<p>And if you guys want to go fund a hardware company that builds a software platform on</p>
<p>top of the hardware and make it</p>
<p>Look at the monopolist over here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a monopolist.</p>
<p>Okay, Robert Barron.</p>
<p>Now I know why you didn&rsquo;t want to say your opinion.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a goddamn robber.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting that Friedberg actually on this issue is actually the free market.</p>
<p>Monster.</p>
<p>Red pill.</p>
<p>No, and everybody else is sort of blue pill.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll point out, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s about red pill, blue pill, like, you know,</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m speaking my book.</p>
<p>I completely agree.</p>
<p>I really better for startups.</p>
<p>Creative destruction.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s better for startups.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t particularly have a lot of trust or faith that these big companies when they get</p>
<p>this big are particularly well run or have the best interests of the broad market in</p>
<p>their minds.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, I&rsquo;ll be honest with you.</p>
<p>I hope these companies get broken up.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great for what we do.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great for entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s super phenomenal for the innovation cycle we could be a part of.</p>
<p>And I would hope to participate in that and make a bunch of money.</p>
<p>The best way to destroy a monopoly is to build better technology that disrupts them.</p>
<p>And that has always been the case throughout history.</p>
<p>And anytime government gets involved and tries to break up a monopoly in a way that is not</p>
<p>natural to the way the market forces might demand, you end up declining an innovation</p>
<p>standard.</p>
<p>We have to disrupt Apple.</p>
<p>We have to disrupt Amazon.</p>
<p>We have to disrupt Alphabet using technology if we want to have an advantage to go win in</p>
<p>the market.</p>
<p>And by having government come in and intervene, I feel like it ends up being like this cronyism,</p>
<p>which ultimately affects markets in an adverse way.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the problem is that the developer network effects around an operating system</p>
<p>monopoly are insuperable.</p>
<p>You cannot overthrow them.</p>
<p>There are now thousands and thousands, maybe even millions of apps have been developed</p>
<p>on the iOS system.</p>
<p>And no competitor can ever get that kind of traction.</p>
<p>It is the Windows monopoly all over again.</p>
<p>And by the way, Microsoft and Windows might have dominated the internet if it weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>for the government coming down with the whole Netscape litigation.</p>
<p>Netscape didn&rsquo;t survive, but it kind of froze Microsoft in its tracks and prevented them</p>
<p>from dominating the nascent internet.</p>
<p>And so, I think that turned out to be a good government intervention in terms of allowing</p>
<p>innovation to move forward.</p>
<p>And by the way, just on the Sicilian proposals, I think part of the reason why they make so</p>
<p>much sense is because we can&rsquo;t break up Apple.</p>
<p>How would you break up Apple, right?</p>
<p>I mean, Apple sells one product, which is iOS on different sizes of sheets of glass.</p>
<p>The only way to break up Apple is to force them to use their, let their operating system</p>
<p>be licensed to other hardware.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not breaking them up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not breaking them up.</p>
<p>So it would certainly create downward pressure on their margins if Dell could make a competing</p>
<p>Apple desktop.</p>
<p>Okay, fair enough.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m saying is there&rsquo;s no natural fault lines within Apple like there are at</p>
<p>Amazon or Google, right?</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s nothing to chop off.</p>
<p>Amazon could spin out AWS very easily.</p>
<p>Google could spin out YouTube or maybe Enterprise.</p>
<p>Instagram, yes.</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s not going to separate iPad and iOS.</p>
<p>Yes, of course.</p>
<p>So what that means is because you can&rsquo;t split up the company, if you want to address their</p>
<p>power, the only way to do it is with proposals like sideloading.</p>
<p>I feel like you&rsquo;re either looking at a capitalist monopoly or you&rsquo;re looking at a government</p>
<p>monopoly.</p>
<p>So if you think about what&rsquo;s happened in financial services in the United States,</p>
<p>the regulatory burden on being a service provider in the financial services industry is so high</p>
<p>that it is very difficult for startups to come in and compete.</p>
<p>And look at what emerged, Bitcoin, right?</p>
<p>I feel like there is always going to be a consumer innovation model that will supplant</p>
<p>the monopoly.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t just say, hey, the government&rsquo;s going to come in and sideload or break up</p>
<p>these big businesses.</p>
<p>What ultimately happens when you do that is you create a regulatory burden that makes</p>
<p>it equally difficult for competition to arise over time, or to reduce innovation that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to benefit consumers.</p>
<p>This is the Princess Leia, you know, basic theory, the tighter you squeeze, the more</p>
<p>galaxy slip through your fingers.</p>
<p>And maybe TikTok and Snapchat are examples of that with Facebook, but there aren&rsquo;t many</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s coming up to fight against Amazon at this point.</p>
<p>So Shopify and Shopify is crushing it.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re incredible.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going to create this long tail of stores that ultimately could end up competing</p>
<p>really effectively with Amazon.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen it right and consumers choose it.</p>
<p>And just because Shopify is making a lot from SaaS revenue does not mean that the majority</p>
<p>of goods are not going to go through.</p>
<p>I will tell you the consumer, the consumer experience on Shopify stores is fantastic.</p>
<p>I mean, we all don&rsquo;t realize it, but we&rsquo;re buying a ton of Shopify stores.</p>
<p>Pretty good.</p>
<p>And it has forced innovation, you know, and I will also highlight that one of the benefits</p>
<p>of these scaled businesses is that they end up having the resourcing to fund new and emerging</p>
<p>businesses that otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t be fundable.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that AWS would have emerged and therefore Google Cloud and all these other</p>
<p>alternatives wouldn&rsquo;t have emerged if Amazon didn&rsquo;t have this thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, it didn&rsquo;t have this incredible Chromium open source project.</p>
<p>And think about the industry that emerged around Waymo, Android.</p>
<p>But nobody, David, nobody&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s suggesting to have broken these thing up in 2007.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s 2021.</p>
<p>And things have changed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s down the road that we&rsquo;re going to miss out on, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I guess my point is, like, you know, let the consumer make the decision, as opposed</p>
<p>to create regulatory burden that over time has its own.</p>
<p>What is the downside to allowing somebody who wants to put an app store on their iPhone?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the downside?</p>
<p>Freeberg?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the downside to letting me have Amazon&rsquo;s app store or Android app store and me to pick</p>
<p>that I want to just have one subscript set of subscriptions.</p>
<p>And I prefer the Android store.</p>
<p>The I&rsquo;m not making it personally, the Apple argument is that the quality of the quality</p>
<p>of I think I just think it&rsquo;s a little bit short sighted for us to all jump to say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s break up big tech, like the quality of what?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Over the last decade is incredible.</p>
<p>And the new products that have come out is just mind blowing.</p>
<p>And, you know, we all kind of miss the fact that these are the beneficiaries of scale</p>
<p>businesses.</p>
<p>And, you know, you can&rsquo;t really see a startup free.</p>
<p>We are not saying break up big tech.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re saying get rid of the 30% app store fee because that negatively impacts our portfolios.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear here.</p>
<p>This is screwing with the margins.</p>
<p>And a lot of the companies we invested.</p>
<p>We want that take rate lowered.</p>
<p>I mean, this is if Apple just made the take rate 15%, this entire thing goes away.</p>
<p>Epic Games feels great.</p>
<p>Spotify&rsquo;s feel great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they should have done when you overplay your hand.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, you create a group of enemies from Netflix to Spotify to Epic</p>
<p>Games.</p>
<p>That was Apple&rsquo;s big mistake.</p>
<p>They should have given those people a lower rate and just slowly lowered the rate, which</p>
<p>is what everybody&rsquo;s doing now with creator percentages.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what YouTube should do now.</p>
<p>The 45% they&rsquo;re taking, just lower that to 30.</p>
<p>Just give up a little bit of the take rate and people will feel more reasonable about</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re taking.</p>
<p>Can I can I bring in the that Substack article by Antonio Garcia Martinez?</p>
<p>It was called.</p>
<p>You want to end on that or you want to end on McAfee getting killed by the Musad and the CCP?</p>
<p>I want to end the Apple segment on on on AGM&rsquo;s article, which was called Bad Apple.</p>
<p>Although great article.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>I mean, it was it was unbelievable.</p>
<p>David was so I just want to let people know how excited David was about this.</p>
<p>David, I think, is like ready to be in a full blown romance with Antonio.</p>
<p>I mean, which David are you talking about?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about you, Sax.</p>
<p>You are.</p>
<p>Are you in love with Antonio?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big pause.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, he got cut out.</p>
<p>We lost him on Zoom when I asked him if he&rsquo;s in love.</p>
<p>Apple came in and they pressed pause.</p>
<p>Press pause on the stream.</p>
<p>Look at the frozen look at his eyes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the look of love.</p>
<p>Jamal, did you read that article?</p>
<p>Of love.</p>
<p>I thought it was really well written, too.</p>
<p>It was well written.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a great writer.</p>
<p>Great writer.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a really, really good writer.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>He is getting paid probably 300,000 to $700,000 to write on Substack after getting fired and</p>
<p>after getting a giant settlement from Apple, whatever that&rsquo;s going to be.</p>
<p>So he is making out like a bandit.</p>
<p>But I thought the funniest part was like, I&rsquo;m not being silenced here because I&rsquo;m now</p>
<p>being paid to talk about Apple for the next year by Substack.</p>
<p>But I thought his most salient point was Steve Jobs would not have been able to exist in</p>
<p>the Apple that exists today.</p>
<p>He would have gotten run out of Apple, is what he said.</p>
<p>He would have been canceled.</p>
<p>I mean, Steve Jobs would have 100%.</p>
<p>David, you broke up when I asked you if you were in love with Antonio.</p>
<p>You just, I think you got.</p>
<p>Apple cut you off.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>No, look, I think I don&rsquo;t agree with everything AGM writes, but I do think he is a fantastic</p>
<p>writer with a lot of interesting perspective.</p>
<p>And that ending of that article, the reason I want to mention it is it goes to Friedberg&rsquo;s</p>
<p>point about how much innovation is there really at Apple now that the genius who created it</p>
<p>is gone.</p>
<p>And he ends his article by saying, when Apple launched the Mac computer in 1984, they famously</p>
<p>ran that Super Bowl ad that featured a solitary figure flinging a sledgehammer into a big</p>
<p>brother-like face spewing propaganda at the huddled ranks of some drab dystopia.</p>
<p>And then AGM says the tech titans nowadays resemble more and more the harangue figure</p>
<p>on the screen rather than the colorful rebel going against the established order.</p>
<p>Whether it be hiring policy or free speech, Silicon Valley has to decide whether it becomes</p>
<p>what it once vowed to destroy.</p>
<p>The reality is the great genius who founded Apple is long gone.</p>
<p>It is run by HR people and woke mobs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s run by a supply chain manager.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And so there is no more innovation there.</p>
<p>They are just a gatekeeper collecting rents.</p>
<p>And, you know, Friedberg, you&rsquo;re right to raise the issue of what&rsquo;s going to create</p>
<p>the most innovation.</p>
<p>But the thing that&rsquo;s going to create the most innovation is letting entrepreneurs create</p>
<p>new companies without needing Apple&rsquo;s permission.</p>
<p>I will tell you something.</p>
<p>I think that over the next decade, because of exactly what you guys said, that Apple</p>
<p>is run by managers who don&rsquo;t want to see loss but aren&rsquo;t driven to gain, you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>end up seeing Amazon in particular, and Apple likely as well, lose to the likes of Shopify</p>
<p>and Square and Stripe.</p>
<p>Shopify, Square, and Stripe are all formidable threats to Amazon over time.</p>
<p>And now that Bezos is actually going to step out, and it is going to be run by a bunch</p>
<p>of managers, and you have these founders of these three companies still running all</p>
<p>three of those businesses.</p>
<p>And all three of those businesses are going to be incredible competitive threats from</p>
<p>different angles on Amazon.</p>
<p>That is where innovation wins.</p>
<p>And you will see it because leadership driven by founders at those businesses could take</p>
<p>them to compete directly with these guys.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t need the government to come in and intervene.</p>
<p>All three of them are building and are going to continue to build better experiences for</p>
<p>consumers and for merchants that could end up disrupting the Amazon monopoly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a different take.</p>
<p>I think that all four companies are going to win, including Amazon.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re going to continue to win.</p>
<p>And I think what it shows is that Shopify and Stripe and Square had to have very precise</p>
<p>entry points in markets.</p>
<p>And in many ways, the things that they are allowed to do is still quite constrained because</p>
<p>Amazon exists.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>That should be allowed.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to get, you know, legislated and then litigated over</p>
<p>the next 10 or 15 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a handful of very specific practices that constrain what folks can do.</p>
<p>I think the app store is a constraint.</p>
<p>The algorithmic nature of Facebook&rsquo;s newsfeed and Google search are constraints, and people</p>
<p>are going to test those things.</p>
<p>And I think that in testing it, you&rsquo;re probably going to do what the government was successful,</p>
<p>as Zach said, in 2000, which is just slow these guys down.</p>
<p>You have to remember, at some point, there were probably more DOJ lawyers inside of Microsoft</p>
<p>than product managers.</p>
<p>And everything, if I remember correctly, from a feature perspective, had to go to the DOJ</p>
<p>for approval for some time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably the best thing that can happen to these companies, which is you completely</p>
<p>gum up the product infrastructure.</p>
<p>Then, you know, Friedberg, you&rsquo;re right, the human capital equation changes, people leave,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that fun to be there.</p>
<p>They go to startups.</p>
<p>But again, you needed the government to step in.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not going to necessarily solve it, but they can really slow down the overreach</p>
<p>of these companies for the next 20 years.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s net additive for the world.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s my prediction.</p>
<p>I think the pirates are assembling themselves, whether it&rsquo;s Coinbase saying we&rsquo;re not gonna</p>
<p>have politics at work or Antonio, and the end of cancel culture, the end of taking the</p>
<p>hysterical left or the historic or the trolling right seriously, I feel like that is ending.</p>
<p>And this great like nightmare of hysteria.</p>
<p>And is going to end and the Overton window is going to blossom and open up and people</p>
<p>are going to be more innovative and accepting of new ideas and be reasonable and not cancel</p>
<p>people who wrote something five or 10 or go go reasonableness.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Yeah, well reasoned.</p>
<p>All right, everybody.</p>
<p>This has been another episode of the all.</p>
<p>Nobody.</p>
<p>What am I doing today?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, you are you inviting us somewhere?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just wondering, or is this a flex?</p>
<p>Are you?</p>
<p>Are you gone?</p>
<p>Kite?</p>
<p>Did you get an electric?</p>
<p>You got an electric surfboard, didn&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a 30pm for me.</p>
<p>So I got to go hang out with my family.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got an aboard meeting and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the Mediterranean general area.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m actually conquering Europe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in Miami.</p>
<p>But I did.</p>
<p>Again, I just want to say I did go to the dentist.</p>
<p>And my film pretty good.</p>
<p>Overcame.</p>
<p>Are you hearing about people moving back from Miami?</p>
<p>This like little thing going on about people saying no, that&rsquo;s people are so happy here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you think you&rsquo;re going to end up living there?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Just maybe.</p>
<p>No, maybe.</p>
<p>Did you get orthopedic shoes when you bought that shirt?</p>
<p>Did you join a golf club?</p>
<p>Are you in a retirement community right now?</p>
<p>Guys, I&rsquo;m on a diet.</p>
<p>I predict by the end of the summer, I&rsquo;ll be thinner than Jason.</p>
<p>Is there a weight back coming?</p>
<p>Go to Dexatrim.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s bring it.</p>
<p>Go to Dexatrim.</p>
<p>No, Dexascan.</p>
<p>Dexascan, whatever.</p>
<p>Go to Dexascan.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Next episode.</p>
<p>Show your Dexascan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll show mine.</p>
<p>Oh, weigh in, weigh in.</p>
<p>Do it, do it, do it.</p>
<p>Dexascan.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll propose a bet.</p>
<p>What are you wearing right now, Jake?</p>
<p>Jake, what is your weight?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m 194.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>195, something like that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your height?</p>
<p>Five feet and a half.</p>
<p>Five nine.</p>
<p>What are you?</p>
<p>You do look thinner.</p>
<p>You do look thinner.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I&rsquo;ve lost about five pounds already.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about 185 right now.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s your height?</p>
<p>Five nine.</p>
<p>Oh, we&rsquo;re the same height and you weigh 10 pounds less.</p>
<p>You look good.</p>
<p>You want any pharmaceuticals to lose weight?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m doing intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing no carbs.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying to be as plant-based as possible.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Go Saks.</p>
<p>Nice job.</p>
<p>Good for you, Saks.</p>
<p>You do look better.</p>
<p>You feel good?</p>
<p>More energy?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I, yes, I was getting like just that extra five pounds.</p>
<p>Like kind of tipped me over.</p>
<p>I think I got like another 15 to go, but.</p>
<p>You think you could be 170?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my goal.</p>
<p>Have you cut back on drinking?</p>
<p>We had some incredible wine last night, you know.</p>
<p>Well, I thought you were a vodka guy.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t you just do like a vodka and soda and be good?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to give up.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t give up wine.</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait till we play poker and drink some more Tomas wine.</p>
<p>It was so fun.</p>
<p>Oh, I can&rsquo;t wait either.</p>
<p>Love you.</p>
<p>Love you, Saks.</p>
<p>Love you, Harry.</p>
<p>Love you, Harry videos.</p>
