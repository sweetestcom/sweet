    <p>What the ffff, what are you wearing, Jason?</p>
<p>What? Oh, Uber had a big week, so this is the Uber-Montclair crossover hat.</p>
<p>Oh, look at that.</p>
<p>And I also bought a Montclair shirt.</p>
<p>You bought that, or I sent it to you? Oh, what? You got the watch and the mug?</p>
<p>Oh, you don&rsquo;t know about the Apple-Montclair watch?</p>
<p>Or the commemorative mug?</p>
<p>Or the new tack?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know about the new neck tats that are coming from Montclair?</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say somebody got their beak wet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that I got a $100,000 sponsorship,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t have a rule in the agreement about logo placement, do we?</p>
<p>Listen, J. Cal, if anyone was willing to sponsor you,</p>
<p>every square inch of your clothing would be covered in ads like a race car driver.</p>
<p>It is. Look.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be like wearing a jumpsuit every day.</p>
<p>You know, Montclair sponsorships are great.</p>
<p>This is $5 plus $17 of shipping from France on Etsy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready to go.</p>
<p>How was everyone&rsquo;s week? What did you guys do this week?</p>
<p>Just busy, working, trying to be helpful where I can.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;ll be the extent of my comments today.</p>
<p>How is Market Street this time of year?</p>
<p>Look, there&rsquo;s all sorts of wild reports.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten all sorts of inbound from people asking me if I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>leaving Kraft Ventures to do something at Twitter.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Jason and I are just pitching in and helping out</p>
<p>while Elon establishes his permanent team at that company.</p>
<p>Elon&rsquo;s the CEO.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s running it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the decider.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s making the decisions.</p>
<p>And some of us are just kind of helping out in any way we can.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really the extent of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, you know, very much part-time thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just helping a friend.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s been like blown up by the media into something much more than it actually is.</p>
<p>It is 100% accurate.</p>
<p>I am still doing my day job, podcasting, investing in 100 companies a year,</p>
<p>just helping out on the margins.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. The end.</p>
<p>I do want to try talking about one issue that&rsquo;s already public</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s already been tweeted.</p>
<p>So Elon had a tweet this morning about how there&rsquo;s now like an advertiser boycott going on.</p>
<p>And this falls on the heels of a bunch of reports that came out over the last couple of days</p>
<p>that supposedly there&rsquo;s been a big influx of like racist tweets.</p>
<p>And Jason and I actually saw what was really going on, which was it&rsquo;s all not true.</p>
<p>I mean, what happened is that within hours of Elon taking over the company on Friday,</p>
<p>there was a 4chan attack where basically people from this message board</p>
<p>created bots to post hundreds of thousands of spam messages that contained</p>
<p>racist words and epithets.</p>
<p>And within hours, this has been detected.</p>
<p>And Yoel, who runs the trust and safety implementation,</p>
<p>he met with me and Jason and Elon directed him to shut it down.</p>
<p>And Yoel actually posted a tweet somewhere about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only reason I feel comfortable talking about it is because you already posted</p>
<p>the tweet somewhere, but maybe people haven&rsquo;t seen it or they haven&rsquo;t connected all the dots here.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s really, I think, unfair about this is that as you&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like your feed was all of a sudden filled with racist things.</p>
<p>These were spam accounts or bot accounts that were posting to zero followers.</p>
<p>They generally have zero followers, or if they do have followers,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s other bot accounts, right?</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re posting racist tweets into the ether, so to speak.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not degrading anyone&rsquo;s experience.</p>
<p>It was shut down promptly.</p>
<p>But then what happens is these activist groups, they&rsquo;re monitoring the fire hose, right?</p>
<p>And so they publish a report saying that racist tweets have gone up 500%</p>
<p>since Elon took over Twitter.</p>
<p>The truth is Elon hasn&rsquo;t even had a chance to change anything about the content moderation</p>
<p>policies.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s posted that, like, guys, I haven&rsquo;t changed anything about content moderation.</p>
<p>Whatever the rules are, they&rsquo;re the same rules that existed prior to him taking over.</p>
<p>And this is just an organized operation by people who want to create that report.</p>
<p>So then these activist groups basically publish this report, they feed it to news outlets,</p>
<p>and then somebody then takes those reports and then feeds them to advertisers,</p>
<p>and you get a boycott.</p>
<p>But I think the point here is that Elon didn&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>This is being manufactured by people who are not operating in good faith.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to manufacture an incident that they can then use to hurt the company.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it was thwarted immediately and fixed.</p>
<p>Have you guys seen episode 333 of the Lex Friedman podcast?</p>
<p>He interviews Andrej Karpathy, who is really, I mean, one of the great minds of our of our</p>
<p>time, particularly around AI and ML.</p>
<p>And the question that Lex asked, which Andrej expounded on, which I think is really interesting</p>
<p>is, what is the next generation of bots look like?</p>
<p>And I think where the problem gets very hard for all platforms, so this is not a Twitter</p>
<p>specific discussion, is that you can now generate such real lifelike human images that</p>
<p>are unique.</p>
<p>And you can also generate high quality text to things like GPT-3 that&rsquo;s also, you know,</p>
<p>that can essentially push the boundaries of, you know, a low level Turing test.</p>
<p>I think the real problem over time for bots, for spam, for coordinated attacks on any platform,</p>
<p>is that when you use these tools, you&rsquo;re going to have to become very sophisticated</p>
<p>in how you try to detect them and then to block them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really interesting discussion between, you know, two pretty meaningfully smart people.</p>
<p>Karpathy was the head of autopilot at Tesla, right?</p>
<p>Autopilot Vision.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s really smart.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that Elon is going to do a much better job stopping bots on Twitter once</p>
<p>he has a chance to do it, because he&rsquo;s got this amazing team of AI engineers, and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just going to be more focused on it.</p>
<p>You know what I like the most about what I heard this week is the idea that you can do</p>
<p>either micropayments or subscription to third party content providers, because I think so</p>
<p>much of my news feed is delivered to me through the Twitter app, and then I click on an article,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s like a paywall, or it&rsquo;s some sort of difficulty in kind of accessing the content.</p>
<p>Having some integration there or some ability to kind of make a micro purchase to read an article</p>
<p>is going to be, I think, a super feature.</p>
<p>The other thing that I would love Twitter to experiment with is if you have a micropayments</p>
<p>model to publishers, it would be great if you could publish content without a byline,</p>
<p>a la The Economist and see what that does to information quality.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You know, if you do not get any credit to your individual name for writing stuff,</p>
<p>but instead, it goes to the masthead publication, whatever it is, the Times, the post,</p>
<p>I think it could have a really important behavior change in how journalists cover the news.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth experimenting with, at least.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re paying them enough money, I think that you could probably demand that</p>
<p>Facebook could probably demand that today, you know, strip the byline away.</p>
<p>And just it just says New York Times, just like today.</p>
<p>It just says The Economist.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is a The Economist is a very polarizing gig in journalism.</p>
<p>For that reason, there are going to be actually a lot of journalists who would prefer to have</p>
<p>their byline taken off.</p>
<p>One of the problems with journalism today is even if you&rsquo;re doing reporting in good faith</p>
<p>Chamath, and you put your byline on there, harassment, you know, threats, etc, can become</p>
<p>very acute if you&rsquo;re just covering certain topics.</p>
<p>And so I actually think a lot of, you know, writers and journalists would opt into this,</p>
<p>they might prefer it.</p>
<p>I think they should, because I think the two ends of the spectrum are better than this,</p>
<p>you know, gross middle that we have the end of this.</p>
<p>One end of the spectrum is you have the New York Times, The Washington Post and The Economist</p>
<p>with no byline and no attribution to reporters.</p>
<p>The other end is if you want to build a brand that&rsquo;s based on your name, go start a sub stack.</p>
<p>And I think that there&rsquo;s a very good balance there.</p>
<p>And The New York Times could syndicate that as well.</p>
<p>But if you separate the two, all of a sudden, the news becomes more likely to be truthful</p>
<p>news versus, you know, well disguised opinion.</p>
<p>The other issue is, you know, for readers, if you do choose to do a no byline publication,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really going to need time to build trust and for people to understand what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>because they will think you&rsquo;re taking the byline off in order to pursue a certain agenda, right.</p>
<p>So that is the the that is the suspicion that can build up.</p>
<p>The Economist has been able to do this over decades with trusted reporting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And sub stack proves that you can have no reputation whatsoever.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re publishing great content, you can build a great business from scratch.</p>
<p>So, you know, you don&rsquo;t need to you don&rsquo;t need to pay your dues,</p>
<p>quote unquote, by getting a byline at The New York Times to be a clever writer.</p>
<p>You can start that business today and get paid.</p>
<p>So I think The New York Times should just focus on being The New York Times.</p>
<p>And sub stack should focus on individual people.</p>
<p>And I think if you could clean up the middle, that would be much better for all of us.</p>
<p>Anyways, I&rsquo;m excited for you guys to help out and pitch in.</p>
<p>I hope you guys do some good with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to come back and use Twitter more often.</p>
<p>Can we talk about the reporting that happened</p>
<p>with the two guys that trolled the journalists and pretended to be fired employees?</p>
<p>Because I actually thought that was such an interesting</p>
<p>moment this week that all the journalists immediately parroted it because it fed their</p>
<p>narrative.</p>
<p>But there was no fact checking done.</p>
<p>There was no reporting done.</p>
<p>And then several of them, including I think Deirdre Bosa from CNBC,</p>
<p>came out and publicly apologized for that report.</p>
<p>Folks listening aren&rsquo;t familiar with what happened.</p>
<p>These two guys came out, they pretended to be fired Twitter employees on Monday,</p>
<p>walked out with a box.</p>
<p>Oh, what&rsquo;s funny, I woke up and they were like, Hey, we just got fired.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>Life is awful.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s even worse than a wife.</p>
<p>You know, the guy&rsquo;s name was one guy&rsquo;s name is Rahul Ligma.</p>
<p>And the other guy&rsquo;s name was like Mike Johnson.</p>
<p>So the whole thing was Ligma Johnson.</p>
<p>So I now here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so funny about due diligence.</p>
<p>I read this story without giving away that punchline to my kids.</p>
<p>All my kids immediately started howling.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, Dad, if you say these two names are Ligma Johnson.</p>
<p>And I was like, Oh my God.</p>
<p>And so, you know, when, when like, you know, preteens can figure this out,</p>
<p>but the journalism industry could not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a very telling side.</p>
<p>Freeberg made the key observation, which is they didn&rsquo;t figure it out</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t want to because it fit their narrative.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t fact check things that fit their narrative.</p>
<p>This was my point about journalism.</p>
<p>It just, it was so poignant to me this week when this happened,</p>
<p>particularly as it relates to Twitter and the importance of call it open journalism</p>
<p>or citizen journalism and the integrity of kind of, you know,</p>
<p>of the voices that we all kind of trust as our kind of journalistic authorities</p>
<p>that these guys came out and they were conned right outside Twitter&rsquo;s offices</p>
<p>into telling a story that fit their sensational narrative.</p>
<p>And it was really a kind of poignant moment for me.</p>
<p>Would you remember that story?</p>
<p>I think it was originally in Rolling Stone.</p>
<p>And then Rachel Maddow amplified it where it was in Oklahoma city,</p>
<p>where supposedly all these MAGA Republicans were eating horse paste</p>
<p>because Trump told them to.</p>
<p>And they were in, this is basically, I thought it was like a COVID therapy.</p>
<p>And then they were going to the emergency rooms of all the hospitals.</p>
<p>And then they were turning away heart attack victims</p>
<p>because there were so many of these people going to the emergency room.</p>
<p>Anyway, it all turned out to be like a made up story, like a hoax,</p>
<p>but the media reported it because the story was too good, right?</p>
<p>It just, it fit too many of their preconceptions,</p>
<p>to me, there&rsquo;s also one, there&rsquo;s another vector sex, which is live coverage is,</p>
<p>you know, you really have to be careful because when doing live,</p>
<p>people will call in and say, Oh, they&rsquo;re at the scene of an accident.</p>
<p>And then they will do a baba booey or whatever, you know, kind of charades.</p>
<p>And so without fact checking, and without saying, Hey, we haven&rsquo;t confirmed this yet.</p>
<p>But these two employees are claiming this.</p>
<p>People want to get real time coverage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine to do real time coverage.</p>
<p>I think everybody in the audience has to understand so much credit.</p>
<p>What about the editor?</p>
<p>There was a picture and it said Ligma Johnson.</p>
<p>No, that is so lazy.</p>
<p>Why are you covering for these people?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not covering.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to explain it.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re missing.</p>
<p>Let me unpack the whole point.</p>
<p>Let me unpack the whole point.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also you interrupted me.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>There is a different standard for live news coverage.</p>
<p>And then there we&rsquo;ve ripped out fact checking from a lot of these publications</p>
<p>and basic fact checking and a little bit of time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m explaining why they make this mistake.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not protecting them.</p>
<p>You want to know why?</p>
<p>The reason they make it, that&rsquo;s part of it.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ve also ripped out fact checking.</p>
<p>And then they are in such a race to get the clicks on social media.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>If the story fits their priors, they run with it immediately.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t do any fact checking because they don&rsquo;t want to know that it&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>There is an element of that.</p>
<p>They will fact check a story if it&rsquo;s a narrative they don&rsquo;t like, because they&rsquo;re going to make</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to try and make sure it&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true of both sides.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll use proxies as well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one mainstream media.</p>
<p>This is the mainstream media.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the alternative?</p>
<p>Fox.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the alternative, Substack?</p>
<p>Fox is the number one news network.</p>
<p>The alternative to the mainstream media is the Substack journalists.</p>
<p>You think Substack journalists do this?</p>
<p>Tell me the writer on Substack who behaves this way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of different ones there.</p>
<p>Who got fooled?</p>
<p>What Substack writer got fooled by Ligma Johnson?</p>
<p>No, seriously.</p>
<p>Glenn Greenwald, Matt Taibbi.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not defending it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m explaining.</p>
<p>Matt Taibbi got fooled by Ligma Johnson.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not defending it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make me defend Ligma.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not defending Ligma.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re both sidesing it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not both sidesing it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you what is happening in journalism today.</p>
<p>They have ripped out fact checking and they are in a race to beat each other because the</p>
<p>first person to get the story up gets the clicks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the dysfunctional thing.</p>
<p>They tried to create a story when there was no story there.</p>
<p>They went and camped out.</p>
<p>They went and camped out outside of an office, mid-market street.</p>
<p>And they said, hey, there&rsquo;s this sensational thing happening.</p>
<p>And there was no sensational thing happening.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And so the little drop that fell into their laps, the little thing that fell into their</p>
<p>laps became the story.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the story they wanted to see created.</p>
<p>There was no story beforehand that there were all these people being fired, walking out</p>
<p>with boxes.</p>
<p>And then they said, let&rsquo;s go send live TV producers down there.</p>
<p>They sent the live TV producers down there and then the story was manifest.</p>
<p>They did the same thing in New York at Bear Stearns.</p>
<p>There was no story to cover.</p>
<p>When they had other major layoffs at Bear Stearns and stuff like that during the financial</p>
<p>crisis.</p>
<p>Of course, they sent people to do live coverage there.</p>
<p>Not defending it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just explaining to you what&rsquo;s going on in the background as well with live TV and</p>
<p>the gutting of newsrooms and having no fact checking.</p>
<p>A lot of these stories go out.</p>
<p>But what about the copy?</p>
<p>Years ago, they used to have my 11 year olds and 10 year old copy editors are better copy</p>
<p>editors than these adults at these.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Incredible publications.</p>
<p>My kids started howling.</p>
<p>They were like, Dad, do you understand what you just said?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll lick my jaw.</p>
<p>I mean, come on.</p>
<p>This is like prepubescent humor that these people fell for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s embarrassing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly embarrassing.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is embarrassing.</p>
<p>And this connects with the 4chan board.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same problem.</p>
<p>This is a grievance industrial complex, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re manufacturing grievances.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny in the case of Ligma Johnson.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not funny in the case of the 4chan board.</p>
<p>But these are people who are inventing stories because there&rsquo;s a certain area to manipulate</p>
<p>media because they know it&rsquo;s so easy to manipulate the media.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Anyways, big shout out to Rahul Ligma.</p>
<p>That was a great start.</p>
<p>Well played, sir.</p>
<p>Also happens to be a huge fan of the All In podcast, apparently.</p>
<p>Well played, sir.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s welcome on as a bestie guestie anytime he wants.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Well played.</p>
<p>Definitely not, please.</p>
<p>Well played.</p>
<p>All right, we should talk about layoffs in tech.</p>
<p>Lyft, 13%.</p>
<p>Riff, 700 employees like yesterday.</p>
<p>Stripe, 14%.</p>
<p>Riff, 1000 employees.</p>
<p>Opendoor Chime, Dapper Labs, all hundreds of employees.</p>
<p>Opendoor, the most significant there, 550.</p>
<p>18%.</p>
<p>Dapper, 22%.</p>
<p>And Twitter.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see what the riff winds up being.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s occurring as we&rsquo;re taping here.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>And then Jason, Apple did a pause.</p>
<p>Amazon did a pause.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And Google and Facebook have.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe trying, maybe signaling a pause, but haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been hiring, like, absolutely at a crazy, crazy pace.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll pull up the chart here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s instructive to look at Facebook and Google because they have not slowed down</p>
<p>by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
<p>Just by the raw numbers.</p>
<p>This all started to peak in June and now is starting up again.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a website, layoffs.fyi, that&rsquo;s been tracking all these layoffs.</p>
<p>You can see the number of layoffs.</p>
<p>These are kind of major layoffs.</p>
<p>And the number of employees impacted been pretty consistent in the third quarter.</p>
<p>It started to die down in September.</p>
<p>From the peak in May and June.</p>
<p>And now this is going to be picking up, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, it feels like this is the double dip we were talking about.</p>
<p>I think this is the beginning.</p>
<p>This is not even unpack it.</p>
<p>Well, I think that we had if you take a very balanced view of what happened this week.</p>
<p>You have to start, I think, with the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>And really what they said is rates will probably be higher than all of you think.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll be higher for longer than all of you want.</p>
<p>And again, without debating whether that&rsquo;s going to come to pass or not.</p>
<p>The thing that you can do is you can build a little sensitivity model to understand the</p>
<p>mathematical implication of it.</p>
<p>And basically what it means is that the dollar that&rsquo;s right in front of you</p>
<p>is now meaningfully more important than the dollar that&rsquo;s far, far away from you.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just assume that the Fed funds rate goes to five and a half percent or so.</p>
<p>Even five, let&rsquo;s go to the optimists and say it&rsquo;s only going to go to five.</p>
<p>Tech companies have to achieve 500 basis points above that minimum.</p>
<p>So we all have to generate 10 to 11% returns for us to be on a risk adjusted basis</p>
<p>better than a government bond.</p>
<p>The problem with that is all of a sudden, you know, if you&rsquo;re trying to generate cash,</p>
<p>even three or four years from now, it&rsquo;s not worth that much.</p>
<p>You need to generate dollars today.</p>
<p>And so, you know, they are really reprioritizing the value of short-term profits.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to affect how companies get money, the cost of capital.</p>
<p>So how much dilution you have to take.</p>
<p>So I think this is what companies are now bearing down for.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re realizing, oh man, I need to get my cost structure way in line.</p>
<p>It is way better now.</p>
<p>Just think about this contrast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s way better to grow at 20% and be profitable than it is to grow at 100%</p>
<p>and burn money because it&rsquo;s not clear where that second company is going to get the incremental</p>
<p>dollars they need for growth.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just a mathematical realization when rates are 5% risk free rates are 5%.</p>
<p>So I think this is this is that moment where you see that pivot from pivot growth to profit.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, we can talk.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been talking about it for six months.</p>
<p>But this is this is this is how it is manifest in Silicon Valley companies is</p>
<p>of scale is through layoffs and cost reductions and cost savings.</p>
<p>So the investments in future growth are reduced.</p>
<p>And the timeline to drive greater profits is improved.</p>
<p>I think what if what Elon is going to do a Twitter or what is reported.</p>
<p>So this is nothing to do with anything anyone told me.</p>
<p>Just what I&rsquo;ve read in the reporting is accurate that he&rsquo;s going to cut so deep.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to cut 30 40 50% potentially of the employee base.</p>
<p>It really sets a new standard for how profitable a tech company can get.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;ll give credit to a Twitter poster named post market who I didn&rsquo;t give credit to</p>
<p>a few weeks ago, when I read this tweet, which I think was a good one, which was that Elon&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really going to show everyone just how profitable these tech companies can be just how lean they</p>
<p>can be run.</p>
<p>And you know, when you&rsquo;re doing a 10% riff or a 13% riff, you may or may not even be getting</p>
<p>to profitability with that riff.</p>
<p>When you cut 30 40 50% deep, and you can actually turn a real profit on a business and enterprise</p>
<p>scale business, like a Twitter or like many other enterprise software companies that are</p>
<p>out there right now.</p>
<p>It really kind of sets a new standard that a lot of folks might then end up saying, you</p>
<p>know what, maybe we should go deeper.</p>
<p>And there could be the case that private equity firms take a look at this.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of these distressed mid cap and small cap software companies out there</p>
<p>that private equity firms now realize, wow, you don&rsquo;t actually need 50% of the workforce</p>
<p>in order to keep the product running and to drive to profitability.</p>
<p>And you could see a bit of a flurry of buyout activity as more folks come in, and maybe</p>
<p>try and mimic the Elon playbook.</p>
<p>So you know, that&rsquo;s one kind of prediction I think may arise if Elon is successful in</p>
<p>making Twitter a much more profitable enterprise, it could set a new model that catalyzes a</p>
<p>lot of other M&amp;A activity, a lot of other buyout activity of these distressed small</p>
<p>and mid cap companies by by other actors.</p>
<p>Can I build on what you&rsquo;re saying?</p>
<p>Nick, could you please just throw up that tweet that I sent just for all of these guys</p>
<p>to look at because I think it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>So to your point, this is an incredible slide.</p>
<p>This is an incredible slide.</p>
<p>And essentially what it shows for those folks that are not watching this on YouTube is it</p>
<p>essentially shows the private software universe, and then the public software universe at</p>
<p>different levels of valuation.</p>
<p>So as an example, right now, there are 15 companies, private companies that are valued</p>
<p>greater than $10 billion.</p>
<p>And there are 40 public ones that are valued greater than 10 billion.</p>
<p>There are 50 companies between, you know, more than 5 billion, but only 60 that are</p>
<p>public that are valued more than five.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>There are 400 companies who have an average valuation of 3 billion.</p>
<p>And then there are already 70 companies in the public markets where they have a billion</p>
<p>dollars of next 12 months of revenue.</p>
<p>And it just goes to show you to your point, Freeberg, if these folks have to generate</p>
<p>an 11% hurdle rate, their cost of capital is 11%.</p>
<p>The companies on the left will have to go through a lot of very difficult cost cutting,</p>
<p>potentially headcount reductions, you know, repricing of the product, all kinds of things.</p>
<p>And many of them have, yeah.</p>
<p>No, none of them have.</p>
<p>Oh, of these?</p>
<p>And many of these are on the layoff tracker.</p>
<p>Yeah, on the left, right.</p>
<p>400, there&rsquo;s almost 500 companies here that have to do an enormous amount of work so that</p>
<p>they have a chance to be on the right hand side of this chart.</p>
<p>The point is that you didn&rsquo;t have to do this when rates were zero, there was just</p>
<p>an abundance of free money and risk seeking and duration that is now out of the market.</p>
<p>Jamal, I think there&rsquo;s also a story that of the 200 companies that are software,</p>
<p>public software companies that you see on the right, some number of them will need to</p>
<p>go private in order to do the restructuring that the market is demanding that they do</p>
<p>in order to get rightly valued.</p>
<p>And to your point, it will happen at meaningfully lower valuations</p>
<p>than where they probably went public or their last round, which will put you guys as you</p>
<p>guys enormous pressure.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you guys look at these 200 companies on the right, how many of them do you think</p>
<p>go private over the next 18 months to get restructured?</p>
<p>Allah, what Elon is showing everyone is possible at Twitter.</p>
<p>18 is 18 months is hard to predict.</p>
<p>But to your point, freeberg, I think if you look at the number of them that are unprofitable,</p>
<p>at least half of them will have difficulty and about so I think about two thirds of these</p>
<p>companies really have no line of sight to profitability in the next two to three years.</p>
<p>And again, if you if you layer in this cost of capital argument,</p>
<p>all of those companies, David will have to raise money at very egregious terms in order to keep</p>
<p>themselves going as a public business, in which case their alternative is to go private in a PE</p>
<p>transaction.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s probably at least half these businesses.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>You think there&rsquo;s 100 PE deals to be done?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>100 by Wow, sex.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Because you know, these businesses and the models, I mean, some of them, it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>get profitable if you&rsquo;re scaling SAS business, right?</p>
<p>Like, you have to get to a certain scale before it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t that&rsquo;s like a very specific question of like, how many of them are gonna get</p>
<p>acquired by PE firms versus going public or going private after being public?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s like a very specific question.</p>
<p>I think the larger point is just that it feels to me like the economy is headed off a cliff</p>
<p>right now.</p>
<p>I mean, I can tell you within our larger portfolio of companies, like I can see the trajectory.</p>
<p>So after Q1 board meetings, I would say about two thirds of portfolio companies were hitting</p>
<p>their numbers and one third were missing.</p>
<p>And it still appeared to be like problems related to those specific companies, not a</p>
<p>macro trend.</p>
<p>I would say after Q2 board meetings, two thirds were missing and one third were hitting their</p>
<p>numbers.</p>
<p>And you could start to feel, OK, maybe there&rsquo;s like a macro trend here.</p>
<p>And I would say after Q3 board meetings, like now, the entire portfolio is reforecasting.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s like a handful of companies here or there that aren&rsquo;t if you&rsquo;re one of</p>
<p>those, congratulations.</p>
<p>But like, even the best companies in our portfolio now are seeing major headwinds.</p>
<p>And this is just, I think, an economy wide slowdown.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s restructuring possible?</p>
<p>I mean, can these companies?</p>
<p>Yeah, because let me just ask in the public markets, do you think those public companies</p>
<p>can get restructured as public companies in order to?</p>
<p>Yeah, it just takes the will.</p>
<p>Yes, of course.</p>
<p>It just takes the will.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s expensive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even think it&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just expensive.</p>
<p>Look at Coinbase as an example.</p>
<p>Like, look, take Coinbase versus Carvana, right?</p>
<p>These are both businesses that issued convertible debt sort of right before things got very,</p>
<p>very hard.</p>
<p>And if you look at where their convertible debt trades, it&rsquo;s trading basically at an</p>
<p>implied yield of about 12 or 13%, both companies.</p>
<p>Now, one is probably, you know, a legitimate bankruptcy risk, which is Carvana.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the market would think.</p>
<p>Whereas the other one, you know, I think it has a very fortified balance sheet and could</p>
<p>weather the storm, Coinbase.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, in a moment where, you know, rates are, again, the risk free rate</p>
<p>goes to five, five and a half, our cost of capital to do business goes to 10 or 11.</p>
<p>These guys have to pay 12 or 13%.</p>
<p>My gosh, it&rsquo;s really, really dilutive to be in business right now.</p>
<p>So it just goes to show you that you can stay public.</p>
<p>But if you want to get incremental money to cover your burn, the only way you can do it</p>
<p>without really, you know, blowing up your cap table and doing a massive recap will be</p>
<p>through convertible debt.</p>
<p>But it has a huge overhang and you risk turning the keys over to the debt holders of the company.</p>
<p>So the alternative for that business is to go into the hands of private equity and get</p>
<p>out of the spotlight of these public markets.</p>
<p>But public private equity is very smart.</p>
<p>And the thing that&rsquo;s happened to them is they can&rsquo;t raise debt.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So what do you think they do?</p>
<p>They just have to pay 50% less than what they would be willing to pay before because they</p>
<p>have to write, you know, 100% equity check.</p>
<p>So there is no free lunch anymore, I think is the big is the big point to point out anywhere</p>
<p>in the market right now.</p>
<p>I think one of the things I&rsquo;m most concerned about or would be is I was talking with a</p>
<p>friend who works at a private, you know, unicorn software company.</p>
<p>And we talked about the numbers of the business.</p>
<p>And I was like, Oh, that company is probably worth x.</p>
<p>And I gave him a number.</p>
<p>And then I asked him how much money they&rsquo;ve raised, and they&rsquo;ve raised more than x.</p>
<p>So I was like, dude, your options are worthless.</p>
<p>Like, you know, this is a real problem, I think that&rsquo;s probably going to become very</p>
<p>systemic.</p>
<p>For scaled unicorn software companies, what happens to these businesses sacks in the market?</p>
<p>You know, as they kind of need another round, but the value of the company is now less than</p>
<p>the total cash that they&rsquo;ve raised that all is sitting as preferred stock.</p>
<p>Listen, it&rsquo;s survival of the quickest, those who are most willing to adapt the most quickly</p>
<p>are going to survive and the ones that are stubborn and refuse to accept the new regime,</p>
<p>the market regime are going to die.</p>
<p>We showed that chart.</p>
<p>Remember that chart from Sequoia months ago on this podcast?</p>
<p>Remember that where it basically showed what happens if you&rsquo;re a company that doesn&rsquo;t cut</p>
<p>burn until the very end, then you&rsquo;re still gonna run out of money and die.</p>
<p>But if you make the cut right away, quickly, you have enough runway to weather the storm.</p>
<p>And I think that what we&rsquo;ve seen is, you know, at my firm craft, yeah, this is exactly it.</p>
<p>Yeah, we showed this months ago.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been begging our founders to embrace this.</p>
<p>We did a portfolio, a review with our entire set of founders of our portfolio companies.</p>
<p>We did one in February, when we felt the markets were changing.</p>
<p>And we did another one in May, and we showed the slide.</p>
<p>And this is the most important thing for founders to internalize</p>
<p>is you have to make the changes quickly.</p>
<p>You know, one way for them to think about it is let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re a unicorn company, okay?</p>
<p>And you raised at the peak, let&rsquo;s say second half of 2021,</p>
<p>you raised $100 million at a billion dollar valuation.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve got 50 million left in the bank, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve burned 50 million.</p>
<p>A lot of these founders are thinking that 50 million they&rsquo;ve got left is only 5% dilution.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what it was historically.</p>
<p>If you were to raise a new round today, you might only be valued at 250.</p>
<p>So that 50 million you have left is actually 20% dilution.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s if you could even raise, which might be very, very hard.</p>
<p>The most important thing founders can do is forget about</p>
<p>the historical terms on which you raise that money.</p>
<p>Forget about how much money you were burning in the past.</p>
<p>Just think about how much money you have in the bank today.</p>
<p>Impute evaluation to it.</p>
<p>So you really internalize how much dilution that money represents,</p>
<p>and then create a new plan moving forward to preserve that cash as long as possible.</p>
<p>Can I say something else quickly on top of this?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really good advice.</p>
<p>The thing that again, people should do is you should just build</p>
<p>a little spreadsheet for yourself to understand what the alternative financing</p>
<p>options are for people who are in the business of investing.</p>
<p>So David, to your point, the current three-month T-bill rate is 4%.</p>
<p>You know, you can buy munis now between 4% and 5% that are triple tax advantaged, right?</p>
<p>You can buy high-quality corporate bonds that are 6%, 7%, 8%.</p>
<p>And so by stocks that are that have a dividend yield of 5% of growth,</p>
<p>growing market leading growing, and so all of a sudden dividend yield.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And so all of a sudden, like turning around and giving it to a company where</p>
<p>there is no end in sight in terms of it doesn&rsquo;t get you to profitability</p>
<p>is a really, really hard thing to do.</p>
<p>I was talking to an entrepreneur, David Soloff, just yesterday.</p>
<p>And he said it really well.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, listen, you know, I&rsquo;m not a macroeconomist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to forecast, but he&rsquo;s like what I understood yesterday.</p>
<p>This is David talking about the Fed as an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>The angle of attack has changed.</p>
<p>The Fed has said this is not going to be some triangle sawtooth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to go up sharply and then come back down sharply,</p>
<p>which is what we would all want if we wanted things to get back to normal sooner.</p>
<p>The angle of attack is now a little bit slower,</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s going to take longer to get where we need to be.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re going to stay there for a lot longer than we want.</p>
<p>And when you roll those two things together, a lot of companies may run out of money.</p>
<p>And so if you can&rsquo;t get to default alive,</p>
<p>you have to look at your cost structure and figure out how to right size this thing because</p>
<p>the cost of capital is just going to be really, really expensive.</p>
<p>And this was the Fed&rsquo;s goal, right?</p>
<p>They wanted to take away this free capital.</p>
<p>They want to slow the economy down.</p>
<p>And it seems like they&rsquo;re making progress.</p>
<p>They did the 75 basis point hike this week, but we&rsquo;re adding jobs to the economy,</p>
<p>we have more job openings, and we had 2.6% GDP growth.</p>
<p>So I guess my question to the everybody here is,</p>
<p>what is the Fed going to have to do?</p>
<p>Or can they stop this consumer and this growth?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very strange, right?</p>
<p>Paolo Paolo said he&rsquo;d rather overcorrect and break things because he has a toolbox</p>
<p>to fix the broken bones, but he doesn&rsquo;t have a toolbox to fix if they undercorrect</p>
<p>and they have rampant inflation.</p>
<p>I mean, not more explicit, you can&rsquo;t get Jason.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s going to take rates until demand is destroyed and enough demand is destroyed,</p>
<p>such that inflation is tamed.</p>
<p>But that has huge implications to all of us because we all have to do our job,</p>
<p>trying to build a company, trying to raise money, trying to invest money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just getting much, much, much harder than I even thought.</p>
<p>So like, you know, for me, I&rsquo;m like, wow,</p>
<p>I thought that we could get through the worst of this by mid 23.</p>
<p>But now you have to plan for the worst, which means,</p>
<p>okay, now I&rsquo;m thinking that men rates could be higher for much longer,</p>
<p>which means, you know, we could be in this market till early 25.</p>
<p>And you may say, hey, that&rsquo;s way too conservative.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you have to plan for conservatism in this point.</p>
<p>So how do I invest money right now?</p>
<p>Honestly, I&rsquo;m like, hmm, I should just put more into T bills.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that crazy?</p>
<p>If a company&rsquo;s like H math can have another 10 15 20 million bucks?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, wow, I mean, I don&rsquo;t think that that gets you anywhere.</p>
<p>And oh, by the way, that 10 or $20 million, I can generate 4%.</p>
<p>What a tough trade off, right?</p>
<p>For well, for somebody who has access to private markets,</p>
<p>which should be high growth companies to take the guaranteed for over the 50 x 25 x 10 x,</p>
<p>whatever we&rsquo;re trying to bet on here.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not just the guaranteed for but if you want to take tech risk,</p>
<p>then you could go buy the corporate bonds of some high quality companies for the 10 or 11%.</p>
<p>So you take moderate risk.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re also competing with that not to zero risk.</p>
<p>Can you explain that for the listeners what that corporate debt is and why it,</p>
<p>you know, pays more?</p>
<p>Sure, there are there are, you know, high quality public companies,</p>
<p>tech companies that have bonds, and that&rsquo;s corporate debt.</p>
<p>And they obviously have to pay a higher rate than what the Treasury pays,</p>
<p>because the Treasury is is risk free, and corporations could default.</p>
<p>So there is some risk to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not zero risk.</p>
<p>But, you know, it&rsquo;s like, if you&rsquo;re willing to take tech risk,</p>
<p>then why wouldn&rsquo;t you buy a bond at 10%, meaning the equity always has to beat</p>
<p>that threshold return.</p>
<p>But But hey, can we just go back to the jobs report for a second?</p>
<p>I mean, the US government could default, but it&rsquo;s considered the least likely to default</p>
<p>of all issuers of debt in the world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I said,</p>
<p>they control the printing press.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s why people call it the risk free rate, because it is the least risky.</p>
<p>The US can always repay its debt, because the debt is denominated in dollars,</p>
<p>and the Treasury can always at the end of the day, print more money,</p>
<p>that would just be monetizing the debt.</p>
<p>Other countries that owe money in dollars, and obviously don&rsquo;t control the US Mint,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>So they could actually default.</p>
<p>But since we&rsquo;re the world&rsquo;s reserve currency, we&rsquo;re never going to default.</p>
<p>However, the dollars that you get paid back</p>
<p>by the US government might be worth a lot less in the future because of inflation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the real risk you have to think about.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no default risk, right?</p>
<p>Whereas with corporate debt, there is.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s just go back to this, the jobs picture for a second.</p>
<p>Jason, you asked about this.</p>
<p>So there is news this morning that we added 261,000 jobs in October.</p>
<p>And obviously, given that there&rsquo;s an election in a few days,</p>
<p>then the administration is eager to point to this.</p>
<p>But if you dig a little deeper in the report, I just posted the link there,</p>
<p>you see in the raw numbers that there&rsquo;s actually 328,000 fewer employed Americans.</p>
<p>And the number of unemployed Americans actually increased 306,000.</p>
<p>And the labor force participation rate declined for the third</p>
<p>consecutive month to 62.2%.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t really understand how all these numbers add up.</p>
<p>But the point is the data is very mixed.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s definitely a negativity in there.</p>
<p>And this feels to me like the last gasp of the bull market,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s this residual job creation.</p>
<p>But you look at just what&rsquo;s happened in the last week, where it&rsquo;s stripe cutting.</p>
<p>I mean, Stripe&rsquo;s probably the single highest quality.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s probably the most valuable private company in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>SpaceX.</p>
<p>No, SpaceX is.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Well, SpaceX, OK.</p>
<p>But like software, pure software company, they had a 14% cut.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re starting to see now the rifts really start to pile up.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;re at the beginning now of a long cycle of the unemployment rate going up.</p>
<p>I mean, it just feels like the economy is slowing so fast.</p>
<p>The markets are, you know, they&rsquo;ve been puking now for six months.</p>
<p>It just feels like this is the beginning of a like really serious recession.</p>
<p>Yet we had GDP growth.</p>
<p>Yet we had job openings.</p>
<p>Remember, we had two quarters.</p>
<p>We had two quarters of net negative GDP growth.</p>
<p>This is when we had the debate about what a recession is.</p>
<p>It was true that if you looked at growth in nominal terms, it appeared to be strong,</p>
<p>and then it was net negative once you subtracted the inflation rate.</p>
<p>You know, we said several months ago, my prediction was a double-dip recession,</p>
<p>where you had this shallow technical recession.</p>
<p>Then it bounced back in Q3.</p>
<p>But now I think we&rsquo;re headed into the second part of it, which is the real recession,</p>
<p>a recession characterized by joblessness.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re starting to see economists say we&rsquo;re going to go from</p>
<p>3.7% unemployment rate to, say, 5% or 6% unemployment next year.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;re just beginning to see the job cuts start to add up.</p>
<p>I think this is what Powell meant, which is, you know, he&rsquo;ll take it as far as it takes,</p>
<p>and then he can fix it on the back end by reintroducing,</p>
<p>you know, quantitative easing and reintroducing lower interest rates to stimulate demand.</p>
<p>But there is a result.</p>
<p>What are the odds he gets this right?</p>
<p>It seems to me that the Fed has a habit of reacting too slowly.</p>
<p>They were too slow to react to inflation.</p>
<p>My guess is that they&rsquo;ll be too slow to react to the recession.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll end up with a period of rates being higher than they should too long.</p>
<p>And then they will correct, they&rsquo;ll drop rates, but that could be two years from now.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, we could be in a pretty deep recession.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re probably right.</p>
<p>Here are the two charts for you to look at.</p>
<p>The GDP by quarter, and then after that, the labor participation rate.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s your GDP, q1 q2 being negative q3 bouncing back, we&rsquo;ll see what happens in q4.</p>
<p>You know, here&rsquo;s your Fed force participation rate for labor, as we discussed,</p>
<p>the thing with the labor participation rate that we&rsquo;re still not sort of like truly factoring in</p>
<p>is like, you know, we had a million Americans die because of COVID.</p>
<p>And, you know, starting in that Trump presidency, we lost like seven or 8 million immigrants.</p>
<p>So those 8 million people have a huge effect on this number.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not properly really factored in.</p>
<p>Because if, if, if you see that at the start of the Trump presidency,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just it just fell off a cliff, basically.</p>
<p>And you also have people who retired early, that was a big trend.</p>
<p>And this all peaked in 2000.</p>
<p>Labor participation hitting that like 67 68%, I think is the peak.</p>
<p>And just slowly going down as boomers retire early, because they made so much on their 401ks</p>
<p>and homes.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Chamath, we&rsquo;ve had negative, we&rsquo;ve really cut immigration the last whatever, five, six years.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s an element in here that&rsquo;s missing on how much people individually are</p>
<p>finding other ways to earn income.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t qualify and show up in the labor force numbers.</p>
<p>People have set up Etsy stores.</p>
<p>Shopify stores have tripled since COVID.</p>
<p>People are making more money on YouTube on Instagram on TikTok than ever before.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole new class of work that revolves around the individual</p>
<p>creating their own business creating their own income stream.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s simply taken off and has taken off.</p>
<p>It was it was kind of a trend pre COVID.</p>
<p>But it really took off during COVID.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an element of this that&rsquo;s really more about the transition of how people work</p>
<p>and how they earn.</p>
<p>That isn&rsquo;t reflected in these numbers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that the idea that everyone should go be an employee at a company is necessarily</p>
<p>the right way to think about labor going forward.</p>
<p>The amount of money that individuals are earning is probably the better way to frame this up</p>
<p>going forward and really thinking about the earning power and the economic health of this</p>
<p>country.</p>
<p>This is something important you&rsquo;re bringing up here.</p>
<p>Gig workers are about 9% of the workforce.</p>
<p>And Uber and Dara had they grew over 70% this year.</p>
<p>But I think the big number that I watched for was drivers are making $36 an hour in</p>
<p>the United States working for Uber.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re exactly right.</p>
<p>People are finding other options, whether it&rsquo;s DoorDash, Uber.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t qualify in labor force, right?</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re no, it does.</p>
<p>Independent contractors are counted.</p>
<p>Yeah, they are counted.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s based on my preliminary research.</p>
<p>If somebody wants to fact check us, that&rsquo;d be great.</p>
<p>But my understanding is independent contractors, which is what gig workers are classified under</p>
<p>are counted in labor participation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how they&rsquo;re counted.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll look that up and figure that out.</p>
<p>There was a story in BBC that the Bank of England has now warned that the UK is facing</p>
<p>its longest recession since records began.</p>
<p>Some of this is getting to be fear porn.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But look, here&rsquo;s what I think is scary about going into a recession is number one, you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really know how long it&rsquo;s going to take to get out.</p>
<p>We know the average recession lasts about 18 months.</p>
<p>But the truth is once it starts, you just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And the second thing is you don&rsquo;t really know who&rsquo;s been stress tested.</p>
<p>People claim that they can weather the storm.</p>
<p>But the truth is that there&rsquo;s no way to truly simulate a stress test.</p>
<p>They claim they can.</p>
<p>But the only way is to really subject an institution to that pressure and that stress.</p>
<p>And then you see if they come out the other side.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the issue.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;re just going into this, there&rsquo;s a lot of unknown unknowns.</p>
<p>And this is why I would just urge founders to be cautious is because if the recession</p>
<p>ends up being shallower and shorter than people expect, great, you&rsquo;ll be surprised</p>
<p>to the upside.</p>
<p>But if the recession ends up being deeper and longer than expected, you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>go out of business.</p>
<p>You want to be protected against that.</p>
<p>So again, we&rsquo;ve been saying this since February and May.</p>
<p>But again, I just reiterate, I think it really makes sense for founders to be conservative,</p>
<p>prioritize your survival above all else.</p>
<p>This recession probably will last about two years.</p>
<p>You want to make sure you survive it.</p>
<p>And to Chamath&rsquo;s point, if you survive it with lower growth, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>You can keep growing on the other end of this thing.</p>
<p>But if you go out of business because you grew too fast, then you&rsquo;re not going to get</p>
<p>the chance to fix that problem when the recession is over.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t see anybody rewarding hyper growth that is burning a ton of cash where you have</p>
<p>to be back in market every year because it&rsquo;s just very hard to feel comfortable that the</p>
<p>conditions on the field aren&rsquo;t going to be drastically different a year from now, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like we know that it&rsquo;s going to be better or worse.</p>
<p>And I think that that uncertainty is actually really bad for companies.</p>
<p>So to your point, it&rsquo;s just like a lot of folks have tried to shy away, David, from</p>
<p>actually revisiting their valuations.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve done these complicated converts and they&rsquo;ve tried to basically, you know, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s sort of like managing their ego or the board&rsquo;s ego.</p>
<p>And I think like the next shoe to drop has to be these founders and these boards just</p>
<p>saying, OK, let&rsquo;s just take the hard medicine.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the real market clearing price and valuation?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get a third party to price it and let&rsquo;s get new fresh equity and then move forward.</p>
<p>Because if you don&rsquo;t do that and you wait until everybody&rsquo;s trying to do it, then it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be a really tough scenario.</p>
<p>So better to your point, you know, this is why I like Stripe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so smart, better to cut now.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s always hard to let people go, but it&rsquo;s better to do that now than 18 months</p>
<p>from now, because you just have no idea how much more expensive or hard it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be then.</p>
<p>And who&rsquo;s going to even be in the business of lending money or investing money in 18</p>
<p>months?</p>
<p>And, you know, that that sounds pretty crazy.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like, I think that that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the moment that we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>To your point, Friedberg, I did a little research here.</p>
<p>And according to the Fed of St. Louis, if you counted casual workers, informal workers,</p>
<p>over doing over 20 hours a week of informal work, aka gig work, you would increase labor</p>
<p>participation between a half point and a point if you counted all of them, maybe even slightly</p>
<p>more than two percentage points higher.</p>
<p>So probably about a point seems like a realistic way to look at labor participation.</p>
<p>And of the eight points, or maybe now the six or seven points to 10%, it would then</p>
<p>account for 10 to 20% of the 10% drop in labor participation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just alarming statistics, because if most people have most of their personal net</p>
<p>worth tied up in their home asset, and their home values are declining or going to decline.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re seeing this dramatic spike in consumer credit in the US, it paints a really ugly</p>
<p>picture for the next two years.</p>
<p>Wow, guys, I&rsquo;m just looking at I&rsquo;m just looking at the markets today, get labs down 15% snowflakes</p>
<p>down 13%.</p>
<p>Monday&rsquo;s down 14% down 30%.</p>
<p>In one day, a Yelp is down 17%.</p>
<p>These are open door is down 16%.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a horror.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, the Cloud Computing Index WCLD has hit a new low for the year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s down to 23 bucks.</p>
<p>I think the previous low was 25 is down almost 8% today.</p>
<p>And this is on a day in which the NASDAQ is down less than 1%.</p>
<p>So the point is,</p>
<p>People are rotating out of growth stocks.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just brutal.</p>
<p>And so, listen, if you&rsquo;re a startup founder, you got to realize these are like some of</p>
<p>the highest quality public.</p>
<p>Twilio is down 40% today.</p>
<p>Twilio is down 37% in a day today.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>But guys, this is this is just math.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not a judgment on any of these companies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just pure math.</p>
<p>This is why I think you have to be utterly unemotional in this moment.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re a CEO, running a company, particularly a SaaS business,</p>
<p>you have to really figure out how to how to right size your cost basis and make this</p>
<p>money last profitable industrial companies are up.</p>
<p>Bill Gurley had a tweet a tweet about this a few months ago about how the biggest mistake</p>
<p>people make in riffs is they just do like a tepid riff, like a 10% ish riff, and they</p>
<p>have to come back and they do it again and again.</p>
<p>This is what I think the the Elon action this week really sets a standard.</p>
<p>He shows the entirety of Silicon Valley, that you can cut deep and you can turn a profit</p>
<p>and you can do it fast.</p>
<p>And it could set a new standard for how folks are managing this.</p>
<p>Jack Welch used to in his management principles, recommend dropping the bottom 10% of people</p>
<p>every year.</p>
<p>And so you know, the 10 13% cuts don&rsquo;t really pass muster as a public market investor kind</p>
<p>of looks at the the management across these different companies to turn a profit.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to say the folks that are making the deepest cuts, the fastest are the ones</p>
<p>that are going to get valued.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unfortunate.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a difficult circumstance for everyone in Silicon Valley to deal with from the employees</p>
<p>to the investors to the public and private shareholders.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really brutal.</p>
<p>One quick question for you guys.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really just this kind of market motivation that&rsquo;s underway right now.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the chart.</p>
<p>And my question for you is when do Google and Facebook stop this?</p>
<p>I mean, if you look at the number of employees being added, it is truly extraordinary.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the chart.</p>
<p>And this includes the latest quarter.</p>
<p>So they are not turning off hiring yet.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Hold on, didn&rsquo;t they announce a hiring freeze?</p>
<p>They announced that they were at Google, they announced that they were going to hold people</p>
<p>accountable to better performance, and they were going to go do more with less, and then</p>
<p>they added more people.</p>
<p>Facebook said they would do a hiring freeze today.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Facebook said it would do a hiring freeze.</p>
<p>And they added jobs.</p>
<p>Well, whatever.</p>
<p>They added jobs last quarter.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>They just announced a hiring freeze.</p>
<p>You look at Apple, Apple just announced in non R&amp;D functions, a hiring freeze.</p>
<p>This is Apple, like the most valuable, most profitable company in the world.</p>
<p>So if Apple basically is putting the brakes on non-engineering hiring, that tells you</p>
<p>something about how fast the economy is slowing down.</p>
<p>I think that was a huge signal.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The point Freeberg makes is so correct, which is, if you&rsquo;re doing a RIF, obviously there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a reason why, but I think we&rsquo;re seeing too many RIFs where the details of the RIF and</p>
<p>the magnitude of the RIF don&rsquo;t match up with what the objective of the RIF is.</p>
<p>The objective of the RIF for a lot of these companies should be to get them cash flow</p>
<p>positive, or at least to put them on a runway or trajectory where they can get cash flow</p>
<p>positive with their existing cash on the balance sheet, right?</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t need to raise money again.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re seeing a lot of companies where they don&rsquo;t achieve that.</p>
<p>And they have to come back again and again and hit it again.</p>
<p>And that creates more turmoil for the company.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s more unfair for the employees.</p>
<p>By the way, sex, to that point, I&rsquo;ll just say how deep these companies are cutting and</p>
<p>how quickly management is expressing to their shareholders, how they&rsquo;re going to turn a</p>
<p>profit becomes a signal for those shareholders on whether or not they want to stay in that</p>
<p>stock.</p>
<p>And the companies that are doing it fast and are doing a deep, the investors and the shareholders</p>
<p>say you do actually have a path that makes sense here, I&rsquo;m going to stay in the stock</p>
<p>cash today versus cash in the future.</p>
<p>Charles, let me ask you a question in terms of strategy for one of these companies, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say fate, the Facebook Corporation, or perhaps even Google, or Apple, even if they were to</p>
<p>cut their expenses, which might take obviously a riff.</p>
<p>And then because their stock prices are so depressed right now, maybe even a mid cap</p>
<p>one like a Twilio or an Uber or an Airbnb, they were cut costs and then start buying</p>
<p>back their shares, which some companies have been doing.</p>
<p>What would that do in terms of the markets appreciation of those stocks or management</p>
<p>teams?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s hard to tell.</p>
<p>I think that if you have not lost investor trust, I think it would be really well rewarded.</p>
<p>If you have become unreliable and undisciplined, even those cuts, I think would be met with</p>
<p>some amount of excitement, but probably not a broad based support.</p>
<p>So, you know, it then it just goes to narrative, meaning if Google did it, I think that people</p>
<p>really trust Sundar and Ruth.</p>
<p>And I think the stock would go bonkers.</p>
<p>They would they would probably move very quickly into the echelon of Apple and Apple is sort</p>
<p>of a first among equals, like they&rsquo;re just they&rsquo;re just in a different class unto themselves.</p>
<p>Facebook, I think, is a little bit harder because I think folks have gotten burned.</p>
<p>And, you know, they would have to make some really, really deep cuts.</p>
<p>But then, you know, where do you do it?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t capitulate on this meta strategy.</p>
<p>But then the other part is where you make all the money.</p>
<p>And so you have this huge morale issue that you have to manage.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a really hard game to play.</p>
<p>Just one more thought on the RIF stuff.</p>
<p>I think one thought experiment for founders is to think about what was your plan at the</p>
<p>end of 2019?</p>
<p>Why do I say that?</p>
<p>Because 2020 and 2021 were two of the most distorted years ever in the history of financial</p>
<p>markets and the economy because we had COVID and then we had the reaction to COVID.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so you saw there was this, you know, Zoom&rsquo;s market cap hit 100 billion.</p>
<p>All the e-commerce companies were doing extremely well.</p>
<p>You know, you had all this money printing, you know, you had zero interest rates and</p>
<p>so on.</p>
<p>You had SaaS companies hitting all time highs at the end of 2021.</p>
<p>So we lived through this incredibly distorted time.</p>
<p>So as a thought experiment, go look at what your plan for 2020 was supposed to be when</p>
<p>you created it at the end of 2019.</p>
<p>Because that was the last time that you were thinking without any distortions, you know,</p>
<p>that were then created.</p>
<p>And I think if you were to go back and look at your 2020 plan, again, created at the end</p>
<p>of 2019, you&rsquo;d probably see that you could get by with half the headcount you have now</p>
<p>because probably you doubled your headcount during the last two years during these heady,</p>
<p>heady times.</p>
<p>And yet, I think founders start thinking, oh, I can&rsquo;t go back to operating, you know,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t operate at half the level of headcount.</p>
<p>But you were, you were operating with half the level of headcount by definition at some</p>
<p>earlier point.</p>
<p>I also think sometimes I think what founders say is what will people think if I cut 50%?</p>
<p>Meaning all of a sudden the perceived success of my business would be different.</p>
<p>And I think that this is where you have to realize, no.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a lot of ego tied up in these things, which slows people down from doing</p>
<p>the thing that they need to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really it&rsquo;s a really hard to do.</p>
<p>I mean, look at Airbnb as an example.</p>
<p>I mean, they did this ginormous riff during COVID because they had no choice.</p>
<p>I mean, their their revenue went essentially to zero.</p>
<p>And now the business is incredibly strong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s throwing off massive amounts of free cash flow.</p>
<p>And the stock market seems to really love what Airbnb has done.</p>
<p>And a similar story over at Uber in terms of having done significant riffs and probably could</p>
<p>do significant ones going forward.</p>
<p>But Jacob, let&rsquo;s just be clear.</p>
<p>Airbnb is still down almost 75% off its high.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So when you say the stock market love it, so they&rsquo;re up today 3%.</p>
<p>So meaning they&rsquo;re not down 30% in one day.</p>
<p>But they have gone down with the rest of the market.</p>
<p>They have gone down with the rest of the market.</p>
<p>But it feels like the business, I&rsquo;m talking about the business fundamentals when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>throwing off almost a billion dollars of free cash flow.</p>
<p>Yeah, now you&rsquo;re going to start people are going to perceive that business maybe as of</p>
<p>this cohort, the flight to safety, right?</p>
<p>Or same thing with Uber throwing off free cash flow.</p>
<p>Now, I think a lot of these names are going to I don&rsquo;t own Airbnb right now, but I do on Uber.</p>
<p>I think the people throwing off the free cash flow are going to look pretty attractive</p>
<p>and be able to buy their stock back maybe.</p>
<p>All right, everybody, let&rsquo;s talk about the midterms.</p>
<p>A lot of big senate races and obviously governors, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona,</p>
<p>Wisconsin, Ohio, all really important races.</p>
<p>Sax, what do you think?</p>
<p>Well, it looks to me like there&rsquo;s gonna be a Republican wave.</p>
<p>There was an interesting article actually on CNN where they it&rsquo;s called five scary numbers for</p>
<p>Democrats.</p>
<p>And what they point to is that Biden right now has a 42% approval rating.</p>
<p>61% of the American people say he hasn&rsquo;t focused on the key problems.</p>
<p>So this is called the out of touch index.</p>
<p>51% say the economy is no one issue compared to only 15% for abortion.</p>
<p>And then 78% say we&rsquo;re on the wrong track.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve seen a right track, wrong track index that was so negative.</p>
<p>And 75% of the country says we&rsquo;re in a recession.</p>
<p>So when you look at polling numbers like that, it must translate, I think, into a Republican</p>
<p>wave.</p>
<p>And you have now real clear politics currently has the GOP gaining four senate seats.</p>
<p>So winning in Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, and New Hampshire, that&rsquo;s a big change from just</p>
<p>a couple of weeks ago and winning 31 house seats.</p>
<p>So this is kind of what it&rsquo;s looking like right now.</p>
<p>But look, the margin is still within the margin of error on the polling.</p>
<p>So Nate Silver has pointed out that within one standard deviation, you could either have</p>
<p>a Republican wave or you could have basically the Republicans fizzle out.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to be very close.</p>
<p>But ultimately, I think this breaks Republican.</p>
<p>Yeah, the to me, the way that I&rsquo;ve, I&rsquo;m looking at it right now is that it seems like most</p>
<p>scenarios, the Republicans will have the majority in the house.</p>
<p>And the real question is what happens in the Senate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, really kind of a coin flip.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to be really interesting to see.</p>
<p>So, you know, things where I thought would break Republican in the Senate, like</p>
<p>Pennsylvania are now back to almost the, you know, a statistical dead heat.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a really interesting moment, actually, it&rsquo;s, but most scenarios, David, I think you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>agree is that the Republicans win the house.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a non there&rsquo;s a plurality of scenarios where they also win the Senate,</p>
<p>the house will almost certainly go Republican.</p>
<p>But I think the Senate now the official percentages are 55% likely to tip Republican.</p>
<p>But I, I just think that in a wave year like this, where the wrong track sentiment is so</p>
<p>high, I think all these races that are a dead heat, they&rsquo;re more likely to break in one</p>
<p>direction, as opposed to like a random distribution, which is why I think you could just as easily</p>
<p>end up with, you know, instead of it being a 51 49 Senate, it could be 55 45.</p>
<p>Because all these things could break the same way.</p>
<p>So right now, so I would slightly disagree in Pennsylvania, I think Oz has improved as a</p>
<p>candidate Fetterman did that debate.</p>
<p>And since he suffered that stroke, he kind of came across as somebody</p>
<p>how do we feel about that?</p>
<p>That I, I had very, very hard to watch that happen.</p>
<p>And yeah,</p>
<p>I mean, the guy, the guy has suffered a stroke, and it&rsquo;s sad, but he, you know, he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>present as someone who can be a senator right now, I think</p>
<p>what does the science say about that?</p>
<p>Like, are we as a society?</p>
<p>Is this a good idea to have somebody post stroke be in office?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not picking any political side here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just talking about the medical issue.</p>
<p>Oz is actually doing the right thing right now, which is he&rsquo;s not actually focusing on</p>
<p>that issue, because it&rsquo;s so obvious, he doesn&rsquo;t want to be seen as beating up on Fetterman.</p>
<p>And instead, he&rsquo;s focusing on the issues.</p>
<p>And actually, Fetterman&rsquo;s issues are very unpopular in a state like Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>So I actually think for both reasons, Oz is going to win that I think Fetterman&rsquo;s manifestly</p>
<p>unqualified.</p>
<p>But also, I think his positions are fairly unpopular.</p>
<p>So I think Pennsylvania will will will almost certainly tip.</p>
<p>So let me pull up the chart here, just so people can see Ohio&rsquo;s going Republican.</p>
<p>And then Arizona, I think is really the interesting one where Blake Masters is now tied after</p>
<p>being behind Mark Kelly throughout this campaign.</p>
<p>He is now tied in Newport.</p>
<p>So popular, your guy is really unpopular.</p>
<p>And now he&rsquo;s tied.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s popular, Jake.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Peter, he was he was doing really poorly, I think, because I think, listen,</p>
<p>I think that I think that Arizona is probably gonna be the closest race in the country.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna be a nail biter.</p>
<p>But I think Blake&rsquo;s gonna pull that out.</p>
<p>Saks, what do you think are the biggest policy shifts that take place in this country?</p>
<p>host this predicted redway?</p>
<p>Is there anything that changes?</p>
<p>So just, you know, talk to folks about what&rsquo;s on the docket from a legislative point of</p>
<p>view, going into the next Congress, with all these new candidates,</p>
<p>the reality is we have a separation of powers in this country, and you&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>divided government, the republicans will will control Congress, the democrats will control</p>
<p>the presidency.</p>
<p>And so as a result, you&rsquo;re going to be largely in a gridlock situation.</p>
<p>But gridlock may be a lot better than what we&rsquo;ve had over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>So, you know, you&rsquo;ve had basically this orgy of spending and money printing, and I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to stop, obviously.</p>
<p>The other thing that&rsquo;s going to happen is republicans may not be able to pass much legislation,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re gonna be able to do investigations.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of questions that need to be answered, I think, about still about COVID,</p>
<p>you know, these lockdown policies that we had started at the top at NIH, why did they happen,</p>
<p>we need to start having accountability for some of these horrible decisions that were</p>
<p>made during COVID.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been no willingness in Washington to hold anyone accountable, at a minimum,</p>
<p>they need to have some congressional investigations and find out why we pursued such bad policies</p>
<p>over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>By the way, did you see did you see what happened this week where the CDC, you know, after this</p>
<p>entire opioid epidemic, and all of these lawsuits, the CDC came out and actually said, Hey, listen,</p>
<p>we need to really make sure that we&rsquo;re getting access, putting opioids in the hands of Americans</p>
<p>who are really suffering with pain management and whatnot.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t read the article to really understand the details.</p>
<p>But I just thought it was an incredible headline where it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s so counter to</p>
<p>the narrative of what we&rsquo;ve been told is happening, which is like, you know, over prescription and</p>
<p>misprescription.</p>
<p>If we learned anything during COVID is to question every organization, everybody and to really</p>
<p>collect your own information.</p>
<p>While, you know, looking at these organizations we trusted over time, I know I look at the</p>
<p>world differently now that you couldn&rsquo;t say COVID was possibly a lab leak without having</p>
<p>your podcast taken down or being banned on YouTube.</p>
<p>And now ProPublica has done an investigation.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re saying along with Vanity Fair, and they&rsquo;re going to win a Pulitzer for this,</p>
<p>I bet that this conspiracy theory from two years ago, is probably actually the leading</p>
<p>theory and that the Wuhan lab lab was showing, if you didn&rsquo;t see it, reporting an incident</p>
<p>in late November of last year before COVID broke 2019.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s really incredible.</p>
<p>There was an article in the Atlantic that came out over the past week called let&rsquo;s declare</p>
<p>a pandemic amnesty.</p>
<p>No, and let&rsquo;s do an investigation.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So basically, yes, all the experts who told us Jason that we weren&rsquo;t allowed to have an</p>
<p>opinion because we weren&rsquo;t expert enough, that if we raise any questions about the origin</p>
<p>of the virus, that it might have come from a lab, that that basically needs to be censored.</p>
<p>The people who said we have to do lockdowns and implement all these authoritarian tactics.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re saying that they need an amnesty.</p>
<p>And what that really means, no one&rsquo;s looking, no one&rsquo;s looking to criminally prosecute them.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re looking to do is have some accountability around the public policy.</p>
<p>What they want is they want to pull the expert card to say that they&rsquo;re the only ones who</p>
<p>get to have an opinion and make a decision.</p>
<p>But then when it all goes horribly awry, they basically want to be completely insulated</p>
<p>and unaccountable from their decisions.</p>
<p>No way, no way.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to give you full investigation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in alignment on this.</p>
<p>Can I just hold on, I just want to say sex, we&rsquo;re in alignment on this for a rare moment</p>
<p>of peace on this podcast.</p>
<p>The same thing after 911 shouldn&rsquo;t all Americans understand what happened after 911 and what</p>
<p>the failures were in our intelligence just so we can get better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not picking a political horse here.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s kind of crazy that you could people said to our podcast and other people who were</p>
<p>questioning it, forget about what political party you&rsquo;re in just want to understand how</p>
<p>the world works.</p>
<p>What are the chances that this breaks out in the one or two places where they&rsquo;re studying</p>
<p>the coronavirus that you have a lab leak?</p>
<p>It was so obvious to everybody.</p>
<p>The other reason why you need to have accountability for this is that there is still a long tail,</p>
<p>especially around the damage that we did to our kids educationally.</p>
<p>Yes, and now and now the over prescription of stimulants.</p>
<p>And so if you don&rsquo;t depression answers, you can&rsquo;t go after these problems like there was</p>
<p>a there was the like, stimulant prescription is now the single biggest epidemic in children.</p>
<p>It is now twice as prescribed as contraceptives and asthma drugs.</p>
<p>And why Chamath?</p>
<p>Why are we doing this to get them to score higher on a test to be more attentive in school?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s actually this negative feedback loop where these children were miseducated.</p>
<p>During COVID, it had huge psychological and academic damage to them.</p>
<p>Our test scores have fallen off of a cliff relative to how we used to do relative to</p>
<p>other countries.</p>
<p>I think the teachers unions have found a way to try to explain it to basically shield</p>
<p>themselves from any sort of critique.</p>
<p>And so the loop and then part of that loop is then to look at a bunch of kids that are</p>
<p>underperforming in school.</p>
<p>And instead of saying, well, maybe these lockdowns and masking and all of these things that we</p>
<p>implemented, actually had a huge impact.</p>
<p>They say, you know, you&rsquo;re misbehaving.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s put you on a stimulant.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in that loop right now.</p>
<p>Just so you guys know, the data is outrageous.</p>
<p>Twice as many prescriptions for stimulants as the sum of contraceptives and asthma drugs</p>
<p>for all American kids.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not that suddenly everybody&rsquo;s got ADHD.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s and we failed them.</p>
<p>We failed our children.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna use stimulants to have them catch up.</p>
<p>We know, but we should be doing summer schools, after school programs, weekends, whatever.</p>
<p>We failed them because of our response to COVID.</p>
<p>That is why we need answers to all that stuff.</p>
<p>Because you need to link these things together to have some real accountability.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Here is the just so we have the people see the numbers.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the 538 poll of how Joe Biden&rsquo;s popularity has switched.</p>
<p>This is 654 days into his presidency started out really strong 54% and now a little rebound</p>
<p>since the summer.</p>
<p>Obviously, that dip started with the economy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the economy stupid.</p>
<p>And if we go down a little bit on the same page, and you zoom in on the left there, you</p>
<p>can see compared to Donald Trump, he started out much more popular than Donald Trump day</p>
<p>by day.</p>
<p>And now he&rsquo;s just as unpopular as Donald Trump was at this point in his presidency.</p>
<p>Well, look, I mean, look, the setup is really interesting for 2024.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s probably going to be the case that we&rsquo;re in the middle of a recession going</p>
<p>into that election cycle.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll be sort of like getting ourselves out of it, but there&rsquo;ll be a lot of economic</p>
<p>damage, high unemployment.</p>
<p>And, you know, typically, folks in power will have to sort of be held accountable for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really interesting setup that both Gavin Newsom and Ron DeSantis have to figure</p>
<p>out now and navigate if they&rsquo;re going to get the nomination on each side.</p>
<p>And breaking news today, Saks would love to get your thoughts on this.</p>
<p>Axios says, and we&rsquo;ll go to Science Corner next, that Trump&rsquo;s going to announce on November</p>
<p>14, that he is running for president.</p>
<p>Look, I kind of have the Joe Rogan philosophy on this, which is why give it oxygen?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just wait and see.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certainly no need to talk about it before it happens.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re not even past this election yet.</p>
<p>But, but hey, I want to go back to the Biden popularity, because I think part of the issue</p>
<p>here is, what are the arguments that Biden is making to the country about why people</p>
<p>should vote Democratic?</p>
<p>And he gave another speech on Wednesday night, where he basically claimed that if you vote</p>
<p>for a different party, that that is a threat to democracy.</p>
<p>In other words, the perpetuation of single party rule is what you must do if you care</p>
<p>about democracy.</p>
<p>That is a sales pitch that&rsquo;s not going to appeal to anybody outside of the viewers of</p>
<p>MSNBC.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not talking about the issues that really matter to the country.</p>
<p>You know, what the country wants to know is that he&rsquo;s focused on the economy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s focused on inflation.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s focused on crime.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s focused on the schools and fixing this learning loss that Chamath was just talking</p>
<p>about.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not doing those things.</p>
<p>Instead, he&rsquo;s basically saying that the Democrats should be kept in power forever, because there</p>
<p>was a riot at the Capitol on January 6.</p>
<p>And look, that was a stain on the country.</p>
<p>Okay, it was terrible that that happened.</p>
<p>Disgusting.</p>
<p>That is not a reason.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>That is not a reason to keep Democrats in power forever.</p>
<p>And actually, there&rsquo;s a liberal guy, a liberal Democrat named Josh Barrow, who wrote a pretty</p>
<p>good blog about this.</p>
<p>And what he said is, the message is that there&rsquo;s only one party contesting this election that</p>
<p>is committed to democracy, the Democrats, and therefore only one real choice available.</p>
<p>If voters reject Democrats&rsquo; agenda or their record on issues including inflation, crime,</p>
<p>and immigration, they have no recourse to the ballot box.</p>
<p>They simply must vote for Democrats anyway.</p>
<p>And that argument is just not flying.</p>
<p>And actually, he&rsquo;s a Democrat who is pointing this out.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that Democrats are getting the message on this.</p>
<p>But I think they will after this election, and they&rsquo;re gonna have to find a new sales</p>
<p>pitch to the country.</p>
<p>Well, you know, and he does have a good sales pitch, doesn&rsquo;t he, Chamath, with these major</p>
<p>bipartisan wins.</p>
<p>He had the infrastructure deal got done, the technology bill, and the chips.</p>
<p>You got gas prices going down.</p>
<p>The problem‚Äî</p>
<p>You got GDP growth.</p>
<p>You got job growth.</p>
<p>The problem is that those things happened, frankly, too early in his presidency, and</p>
<p>things are getting materially worse.</p>
<p>So I just sent you a link.</p>
<p>Can you just throw this up here for a second?</p>
<p>You know, Jason, you mentioned this cheaper gas thing.</p>
<p>But the reality is, if you look at this, we have now depleted our strategic oil reserve</p>
<p>by almost 50%.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we are running out of oil that we can introduce into the market at effectively zero cost</p>
<p>to bring the price down.</p>
<p>And because we&rsquo;ve lost our relationships with folks like Saudi Arabia, there&rsquo;s no way to</p>
<p>influence them in order to produce more.</p>
<p>In fact, they&rsquo;re gonna cut supply so that they can control the prices that they have</p>
<p>which‚Äî that they can sell into the market.</p>
<p>And so now what are we left with?</p>
<p>Well, the only three places where you can have incremental supply of energy, which the</p>
<p>country still needs, is from Russia, Iran, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>And so, you know, all of these things, Jason, I think, come back and really put Biden in</p>
<p>a tough place because, as Sak says, he does have to answer to all of these things because</p>
<p>these are his decisions.</p>
<p>Look, I still believe in the Democrats.</p>
<p>You know, I am hoping‚Äî I gave a million bucks to the Senate PAC trying to sort of</p>
<p>tip the Senate.</p>
<p>I really think it&rsquo;s important that we have a split government because I&rsquo;ve kind of‚Äî I</p>
<p>gave up on the House.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s clear that the Republicans are going to win, but the Senate is still‚Äî is</p>
<p>still up for grabs.</p>
<p>And the reason is because I think that we need to sort of have stasis so that nothing</p>
<p>bad happens between now and 2024 because I think the economic conditions on the ground</p>
<p>are going to be bad in and of themselves.</p>
<p>And then the last‚Äî</p>
<p>Free burqa.</p>
<p>Sorry, and then just the one last thing I&rsquo;ll say is the instructive thing that I think</p>
<p>we should look at is what happened in Germany because what happened in Germany is really</p>
<p>interesting.</p>
<p>When the economy turns and inflation is out of control and energy is out of control, what</p>
<p>they basically did was they sidelined the European Central Bank.</p>
<p>They stepped in with their own balance sheet and said, you know what, we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>nationalize assets.</p>
<p>And I know that this sounds crazy to say, but if it can happen in a place like Germany,</p>
<p>I know most people would say it&rsquo;ll never happen in America, but I&rsquo;m not so sure.</p>
<p>And I think that you want to make sure that there&rsquo;s a split government so that these</p>
<p>things are never possible.</p>
<p>And so hopefully there&rsquo;s some, you know, common ground in a Democratic Senate and a</p>
<p>Republican House, and we just kind of get through 24 and see where the chips land.</p>
<p>And I still think it&rsquo;s going to be DeSantis versus Newsom.</p>
<p>Friedberg, any final thoughts here on politics in relation‚Äî</p>
<p>My first observation is that I think it&rsquo;s funny that Chamath and Sachs are funding opposite</p>
<p>sides of the electoral cycle.</p>
<p>Yeah, why don&rsquo;t you just guys just give the money to me and Friedberg to get a plane?</p>
<p>I could think of other ways for you guys to use that money.</p>
<p>But David and I may have cancelled each other out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I mean, so far, Peter Thiel made the better trade.</p>
<p>It looks like the Thiel wave in the Senate.</p>
<p>So look, I would say my very broad statement is democracies evolve in a cyclical nature</p>
<p>over time, right?</p>
<p>You often see swings from one political party to the other.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just the nature that once someone&rsquo;s been in office, they form the new establishment.</p>
<p>And then folks on the next election cycle want to vote against that establishment because</p>
<p>there are things that they want that they aren&rsquo;t being given today.</p>
<p>And therefore, the democracy forces a change from what is the current establishment back</p>
<p>to the other side.</p>
<p>And generally, political parties seem to kind of adopt whatever the other side is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how the cyclical evolution of democracy seems to play out.</p>
<p>The recent trend that has been more alarming, which I think we can kind of take pause to</p>
<p>notice is the rise of populism, where populism is this really kind of vehement, diehard opposition</p>
<p>to elitism and the establishments that everyone feels kept down by and everyone feels taken</p>
<p>advantage of by.</p>
<p>And the rise of Trump, the rise of Bolsonaro, the rise of Boris Johnson, and I would argue</p>
<p>even the rise of AOC, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, all similarly speak to the crying</p>
<p>voice of the democratic populations that they want to see these establishments taken</p>
<p>apart.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t feel like they&rsquo;re fair.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t feel like they&rsquo;re just.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t feel like the institutions that oversee us and are meant to service us are</p>
<p>servicing us.</p>
<p>And so there was this big rise.</p>
<p>The problem is like a normal pendulum would swing back and forth between one side and</p>
<p>the other.</p>
<p>With the rise of populism, you get such a strong push of that pendulum, it can knock</p>
<p>through a wall.</p>
<p>And I think we saw that on January 6.</p>
<p>And I think it gave a lot of people pause.</p>
<p>We saw the motion of Brexit knocking through a wall.</p>
<p>And we saw these kind of very radical outcomes.</p>
<p>And then the cost of those outcomes blow up in our face.</p>
<p>And as a result, I think we&rsquo;re seeing a bit of a receding of the tides right now away</p>
<p>from populism.</p>
<p>During this current electoral cycle, where folks are saying, you know what, maybe we</p>
<p>just need to have some sort of an establishment so I can feel safe and secure, less than the</p>
<p>volatile volatility that I&rsquo;ve experienced of late.</p>
<p>Look, I think you look at the economic mess we&rsquo;re in, okay, populist did not cause that,</p>
<p>okay, populist did not cause $10 trillion of money printing, it was modern monetary</p>
<p>theory.</p>
<p>And the experts, the Fed, who did that, it wasn&rsquo;t populist, who created the great financial</p>
<p>crisis of 2008, that caused the Zerp.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re still living with all the downstream effects of that.</p>
<p>It was the experts on Wall Street, who said they could manage all these derivatives and</p>
<p>the collateralized mortgage obligations and all that stuff that they lost control over.</p>
<p>I would argue that the CDC are the experts, yeah.</p>
<p>The CDC are the experts that caused that.</p>
<p>And on COVID, it was not populist who caused the horrible handling of that pandemic, even</p>
<p>though they were blamed for it.</p>
<p>Remember, we were told it was a pandemic of the unvaccinated, then it turns out the vaccine</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t stop it.</p>
<p>It was not populist who caused the reaction to the pandemic.</p>
<p>It was the experts, the CDC, and Fauci, and people like that who shut down our economy,</p>
<p>who caused the learning loss.</p>
<p>It was those experts.</p>
<p>So, Freeberg, listen, you may not like this populist wave that we have in the country,</p>
<p>and I get that, but it&rsquo;s in reaction to something real, which is the failure of this expert</p>
<p>class.</p>
<p>And if you want to stop having this populist wave rise up, we need to start having experts</p>
<p>in position of power who actually know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t have any opposition to the populist wave.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making the observation that the effects of some of the populist movements have started</p>
<p>to become too volatile for people to feel like they should continue forward with that</p>
<p>electoral path.</p>
<p>That was my observation.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m not kind of criticizing the populist movement.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that events like January 6, and the conditions in the UK, for example,</p>
<p>are making people say, wait a second, maybe I need to take pause on the extreme.</p>
<p>The bond market basically fired Liz Truss.</p>
<p>I mean, she&rsquo;s not a populist.</p>
<p>And Bolsonaro in Brazil, he actually just lost, and there was this big narrative that</p>
<p>somehow he was going to not relinquish power, and he just announced that he will relinquish</p>
<p>power.</p>
<p>So, some of the stuff that is about how populists pose this great danger, I think, is threat</p>
<p>inflation, and that the threat is magnified by elites who want to stay in power.</p>
<p>And the truth of the matter is, we need accountability for the people in power.</p>
<p>And when they set the wrong policies and decisions, they need to be replaced.</p>
<p>No more no more unaccountability.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, 100% just just my personal belief 100% agree accountability is what&rsquo;s lacking</p>
<p>most across all of these institutions.</p>
<p>100% agree.</p>
<p>Accountability, maybe competence, and also transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>Like, I think that&rsquo;s what the public wants.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no measured by you want to hear there&rsquo;s no modern second, hold on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to perfectly react to the pandemic.</p>
<p>But in your mistakes, owning them and explaining them would be much better than trying to</p>
<p>obscurify it and asking for amnesty Chamath.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not if you want to hear an incredibly interesting interview.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s very thought provoking of a modern progressive, but with a very different mindset,</p>
<p>or sorry, you know, maybe you don&rsquo;t want to call him a progressive, but is the</p>
<p>president of El Salvador, Naib Bukele.</p>
<p>And he did this incredible interview with Tucker Carlson on Fox News.</p>
<p>I encourage everybody to watch it on both sides of the political spectrum.</p>
<p>That man is impressive.</p>
<p>Did we just get an admission that Chamath watches Tucker?</p>
<p>I watched that interview.</p>
<p>You watched the Tucker?</p>
<p>Oh, my Lord.</p>
<p>Jason&rsquo;s head&rsquo;s exploding.</p>
<p>You know, because I try not to be a complete ignoramus.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an entertainer.</p>
<p>I like to watch things on both sides.</p>
<p>But that interview is incredible.</p>
<p>He is unbelievably impressive.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a, it double clicks into, you know, the skepticism that smart people like him,</p>
<p>the outsider class has with the insider expert class in a nutshell, if you want to see it,</p>
<p>I would encourage you to watch this interview because it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Incredible, really, really.</p>
<p>Jason, the peasants with pitchforks are rising up against this elite class who&rsquo;s put themselves up,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve set themselves up as Lords, they want exclusive control over their blue checks.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re about to overturn this establishment, because it is corrupt.</p>
<p>And it is incompetent.</p>
<p>It would be great if the people who work for us were confident and owned and were transparent.</p>
<p>You know, I think that&rsquo;s why people are opting out of this is they don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a level of competence in these institutions, nor ownership,</p>
<p>and transparency.</p>
<p>And it really is frustrating, whether it&rsquo;s education, or it&rsquo;s health, or,</p>
<p>you know, any of these topics we&rsquo;ve talked about here on the show,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go to science corner, and we can wrap.</p>
<p>What do you got free bark for us to mock,</p>
<p>I think we were going to cover the Facebook meta announcement that their AI research team</p>
<p>had generated the physical structure of 617 million proteins from these metagenomic data</p>
<p>sets. And so remember, alpha fold made this big announcement that they had</p>
<p>highly accurate predictions of protein structure, the three dimensional shape of proteins.</p>
<p>And remember, proteins are kind of the machines of biology that do everything from catalysis to</p>
<p>enzymes where they break stuff down. And they&rsquo;re like, you know,</p>
<p>they have all this structure that allows them to do specific physical things.</p>
<p>And proteins are coded in DNA, every three letters of DNA codes for an amino acid,</p>
<p>a string of amino acids makes a protein.</p>
<p>And so, you know, we have about a million species,</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;ve sequenced the entire genome of those species, only about 3000 animals, by the way,</p>
<p>including humans, half a million from bacterial species, and then a bunch of viruses and other</p>
<p>stuff, but but call it about a million species that we&rsquo;ve sequenced. And so, you know, earlier</p>
<p>this year, Google&rsquo;s alpha fold project published the 3d structure of 200 million proteins that</p>
<p>they had derived from the whole genome databases that existed, where we&rsquo;ve gone through and figured</p>
<p>out what&rsquo;s the full DNA sequence of all these different species. Now, when you look at the DNA</p>
<p>in the environment around us, you were just to take the DNA out, it turns out that we have seen</p>
<p>very little of that DNA, the vast majority of DNA that you would find in a teaspoon of soil,</p>
<p>for example, we&rsquo;ve never classified, it&rsquo;s not part of a species that we&rsquo;ve actually built the</p>
<p>whole genome around, we may not even know what species that DNA is from. And so when you take</p>
<p>a teaspoon of soil, you&rsquo;ll get about 100 billion microorganisms in that soil from about a million</p>
<p>unique species. But you don&rsquo;t see those species because the way DNA sequencing or shotgun</p>
<p>sequencing works, is DNA is chopped up into little 250 base pair likes little 250 strands,</p>
<p>and those 250 letters are read at a time. And then statistically, bioinformatics puts together</p>
<p>all of that little DNA segments and tries to create long strands of DNA to figure out what</p>
<p>the genes are, or what the whole genome is. And so shotgun sequencing gives us kind of a snapshot of</p>
<p>the DNA. But until we&rsquo;ve done the hard work of figuring out the whole genome, we don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>species that DNA comes from. So when you take a sample of soil, or you take a sample of human poop,</p>
<p>and you sequence it, or even a teaspoon of ocean water, and you just sequence the DNA in it,</p>
<p>you get all of these little segments of DNA that we&rsquo;ve never seen before. And you can string them</p>
<p>together statistically, because you get lots and lots of copies of them. And you can figure out</p>
<p>the overlap. And then you can create these genes. And a gene is a segment of DNA that codes for a</p>
<p>protein. And those genes make up the meta genome, or the combination of all the genes that we find</p>
<p>in a piece of the environment. And that meta genome comes from millions of species that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never seen before. So what alpha what they did at meta is they took all of those genes that we pull</p>
<p>out of the soil, or we pull out of the ocean, and they picked a bunch of random samples. And they</p>
<p>then predicted the physical structure of the proteins from just those genes, without knowing</p>
<p>what organism they came from. And this gives us a whole new universe of proteins that we&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>classified before, or never seen before. Now, I will just kind of speak a little bit critically</p>
<p>about it. Number one, they didn&rsquo;t do what alpha fold did. What alpha fold did is they took 3d</p>
<p>structures from typically x ray crystallography, then they took the DNA code, and they built</p>
<p>machine learn models to figure out the 3d structure from the DNA code. What these guys did at meta is</p>
<p>they took the 3d structures and the code, and they basically did a fill in the blank, they found all</p>
<p>the meta genome data out of these samples, and a lot of it was missing. And they filled in the</p>
<p>missing blanks using kind of common protein structure that existed out there in the wild</p>
<p>that we already knew from the alpha fold data. And so they kind of did a fill in the blank.</p>
<p>And as a result, it allowed them to very quickly build these 3d models versus doing the hard and</p>
<p>rigorous work that alpha fold had to do. So they claim that it was 60 times faster, but it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>an entirely different technique. And the second thing is that they represent that only about a</p>
<p>third of it is high quality, meaning only about a third of the proteins that they&rsquo;ve created</p>
<p>structure for are really useful or that could be kind of applied in terms of this is the real</p>
<p>representation. Now, why is this interesting and important proteins can form the basis of new</p>
<p>medicines. So you know, we can find proteins in the soil, a genomes in the soil and proteins in</p>
<p>the soil that can kill certain fungal pathogens that can kill bacteria, and those can be turned</p>
<p>into fungicides, they can be turned into antibiotics, we can find proteins that bind to</p>
<p>specific things, we can find proteins that fix nitrogen from the atmosphere. And those proteins</p>
<p>can be turned into new types of fertilizer. So you know, searching through this universe of proteins</p>
<p>that exists in the metagenome will allow us to find new molecules to do new and interesting things</p>
<p>with in the applied engineering world. And I will say like, this is what would the output of these</p>
<p>be is what everybody&rsquo;s going to be thinking, antibiotics, fertilizers, I mean, the idea of</p>
<p>the metagenome is rather than start with the species and then take the genes out of it,</p>
<p>just go get the genes, the genes are already there, they&rsquo;re in this, they&rsquo;re in the ocean,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in the soil. And there&rsquo;s millions of genes, hundreds of millions, billions of genes</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve never seen before. Therefore, there&rsquo;s billions of proteins. Now we could randomly create</p>
<p>proteins. But the number of proteins that could exist is more than the number of atoms in the</p>
<p>universe. Because remember, there&rsquo;s 20 amino acids. So 20 to the 200th power or 20 to the 300th power</p>
<p>or 20 to the 1000th power, meaning how many different combinations of amino acids can you</p>
<p>make? That&rsquo;s more than there are atoms in the universe. So the best place to start is what</p>
<p>evolution has already given us all the proteins that exist in the environment. So let&rsquo;s go find</p>
<p>those proteins in the environment. And then let&rsquo;s figure out what do we think they can be used for?</p>
<p>Can they be used in industrial applications? In medicine? Can they be doing them in material</p>
<p>science? You&rsquo;re saying correct material science. And so you know, a lot of drug discovery,</p>
<p>mines proteins, it tries to find proteins and figure out what can these proteins be used for.</p>
<p>And now we have all these new data sets of proteins that are being generated from these metagenomes.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s amazing. I mean, you know, look at the world around you look everywhere up and down on</p>
<p>the walls on the ground below you. There are billions of species of organisms that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never classified before that are making billions of unique proteins that we&rsquo;ve never classified</p>
<p>before. And any one of them could unlock an amazing commercial opportunity for industry. So</p>
<p>and for medicine and for human health. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really exciting about this ability to</p>
<p>kind of mine the metagenome. Silly question for you. Or maybe not silly. We have gotten</p>
<p>the precursors to DNA for meteorites. If I understand correctly, what do they call them</p>
<p>nucleobases? You clay cassettes? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, etc. Like things that exist in DNA</p>
<p>that are precursors. We&rsquo;ve never had DNA from space, obviously, but we could at some point</p>
<p>start to find DNA out there in space. And this could have an even crazier impact on what we built</p>
<p>here. Is that the next card to turn over after we know what&rsquo;s here? No, I wouldn&rsquo;t say so. Like,</p>
<p>I think, look, if there&rsquo;s DNA that&rsquo;s coming to us for meteorites, call it a couple 100 genes,</p>
<p>you could pick up a piece of soil and find over a billion genes in that piece of soil,</p>
<p>right? So we have far more to mine here on earth. And the low cost of DNA sequencing and shotgun</p>
<p>sequencing, coupled with bioinformatics, where we take all that. So just to give you guys a sense,</p>
<p>when you take a teaspoon of soil, and you get the DNA out and you read the DNA out of it,</p>
<p>sequence the DNA, that&rsquo;s potentially 10s of gigabytes of data. And then you could do that</p>
<p>millions of times over. And then you statistically can find genes, and then statistically estimate</p>
<p>what they physically look like what those proteins look like. And then you can start to build models</p>
<p>around which ones do we want to try and use for drug applications? Which ones do we want? So</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much work to do it just in terms of what we have here on earth. And the tools are</p>
<p>getting so cheap and so available. There are labs that are all over the world starting to kind of</p>
<p>spring up to do this work. It&rsquo;s super exciting. traffic. It&rsquo;s kind of, you know, just to put two</p>
<p>ideas together. I&rsquo;ve said before, like the two big investable themes that I&rsquo;m orienting my</p>
<p>organization around is this one is that the marginal cost of energy goes to zero. And the</p>
<p>second is that the marginal cost of compute goes to zero. And the second one is really about shifting</p>
<p>compute to more parallelism on GPUs and ASICs and FPGAs. But that&rsquo;s why all of this stuff is</p>
<p>possible. The fact that, you know, meta can do this, and Google can do alpha fold is largely</p>
<p>because the cost of all of this stuff is, you know, trivial for these kinds of companies. So</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really exciting. It&rsquo;s going to move science, in my opinion, out of this in vivo in vitro</p>
<p>experimentation model into silica. And so those who can actually build learning machines will solve</p>
<p>some of the most important biological problems. So I, I&rsquo;m a real believer in this stuff. I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s super exciting. When do you think this stuff actually hits Friedberg our life? That&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>when people talk about these discoveries? Yeah, a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize it. But so many</p>
<p>molecules that that are used in agriculture, like fungicides to kill fungus in the fields,</p>
<p>those are derived from this sort of work. A lot of antibiotics, a lot of medicines are already</p>
<p>derived from mining genomes, finding new proteins, and seeing what those proteins can do. Because</p>
<p>these proteins didn&rsquo;t evolve in the environment randomly, they evolved to do something. And in</p>
<p>many cases, we can take that thing that they do and then harness it into a product. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s so exciting. And this this affects everything material science. You know, agriculture,</p>
<p>human health, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a food, it&rsquo;s really profound. Awesome. All right, everybody, there</p>
<p>you have it. That&rsquo;s another all in podcast in the can. By the way, so many so many of freeberg</p>
<p>stands were afraid Jekyll that you and I were gonna make some joke. And we didn&rsquo;t know we didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so for all these stands, I just I hope you guys can exhale. Take a deep breath, man. Have</p>
<p>some, you know, eggless mayo and enjoy your weekend. Enjoy your week. Bye bye, everybody.</p>
<p>See you next time. Love you besties. Love you guys.</p>
<p>Love you.</p>
