    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Ian Hutchinson, a nuclear engineer and plasma physicist at MIT.</p>
<p>He has made a number of important contributions in plasma physics, including the magnetic confinement of plasmas,</p>
<p>seeking to enable fusion reactions, which happens to be the energy source of the stars,</p>
<p>to be used for practical energy production. Current nuclear reactors, by the way, are based on fission, as we discuss.</p>
<p>Ian has also written on the philosophy of science and the relationship between science and religion,</p>
<p>arguing in particular against scientism, which is a negative description of the overreach of the scientific method to questions not amenable to it.</p>
<p>On this latter topic, I recommend two of his books, his new one, Can a Scientist Believe in Miracles?,</p>
<p>where he answers more than 200 questions on all aspects of God and science,</p>
<p>and his earlier book on scientism called Monopolizing Knowledge.</p>
<p>As you may have seen already, I work hard on having an open mind, always questioning my assumptions,</p>
<p>and in general marvel at the immense mystery of everything around us and the limitations of at least my mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not religious myself in that I don&rsquo;t go to the synagogue, a church, a mosque,</p>
<p>but I see the beautiful bond in the community that religion at its best can create.</p>
<p>I also see, both in scientist and religious leaders, signs of arrogance, hypocrisy, greed, and a will to power.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re human. Whether Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, agnostic, or atheist,</p>
<p>this podcast is my humble attempt to explore a complicated human nature.</p>
<p>What Stanislav Lem in his book Solaris called our own labyrinth of dark passages and secret chambers.</p>
<p>I ask that you try to keep an open mind as well and be patient with the limitations of mind.</p>

<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Ian Hutchinson.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;d be nice to draw a distinction between nuclear physics and plasma physics.</p>
<p>What is the distinction?</p>
<p>Nuclear physics is about the physics of the nucleus.</p>
<p>And my department, Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering at MIT,</p>
<p>is very concerned about all the interactions and reactions and consequences of things that go on in the nucleus,</p>
<p>including nuclear energy, fission energy, which is the nuclear energy that we have already,</p>
<p>and fusion energy, which is the energy source of the sun and stars,</p>
<p>which we don&rsquo;t quite know how to turn into practical energy for humankind at the moment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what my research has mostly been aimed at.</p>
<p>But plasmas are essentially the fourth state of matter.</p>
<p>So if you think about solid, liquid, gas, plasma is the fourth of those states of matter.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually the state of matter which one reaches if one raises the temperature.</p>
<p>So cold things, you know, like ice are solid.</p>
<p>Liquids are hotter water.</p>
<p>And if you heat water beyond 100 degrees Celsius, it becomes gas.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s true of most substances.</p>
<p>And plasma is a state of matter in which the electrons are unbound from the nuclei.</p>
<p>So they become separate from the nuclei and can move separately.</p>
<p>So we have positively charged nuclei and we have negatively charged electrons.</p>
<p>The net is still electrically neutral.</p>
<p>But a plasma conducts electricity, has all sorts of important properties that are associated</p>
<p>with that separation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what plasmas are all about.</p>
<p>And the reason why my department is interested in plasma physics very strongly is because</p>
<p>most things, well, for one thing, most things in the universe are plasma.</p>
<p>The vast majority of matter in the universe is plasma.</p>
<p>But most particularly, stars and the sun are plasmas because they&rsquo;re very hot.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only in very hot states that nuclear fusion reactions take place.</p>
<p>And we want to understand how to implement those kind of phenomena on Earth.</p>
<p>Maybe another distinction we want to try to get at is the difference between fission</p>
<p>and fusion.</p>
<p>So you mentioned fusion is the kind of reaction happening in the sun.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s fission and what&rsquo;s fusion?</p>
<p>Well, fission is taking heavy elements like uranium and breaking them up.</p>
<p>And it turns out that that process of breaking up heavy elements releases energy.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be a heavy element?</p>
<p>It means that there are many nuclear particles in the nucleus itself, neutrons and protons</p>
<p>in the nucleus itself so that in the case of uranium, there are 92 protons in each nucleus</p>
<p>and even more neutrons so that the total number of nucleons in the nucleus, nucleons is short</p>
<p>for either a proton or a neutron, the total number might be 235, that&rsquo;s U235, or it might</p>
<p>be 238, that&rsquo;s U238.</p>
<p>So those are heavy elements.</p>
<p>Light elements, by contrast, have very few nucleons, protons or neutrons in the nucleus.</p>
<p>Hydrogen is the lightest nucleus.</p>
<p>It has one proton.</p>
<p>There are actually slightly heavier forms of hydrogen, isotopes.</p>
<p>Deuterium has a proton and a neutron and tritium has a proton and two neutrons.</p>
<p>So it has a total of three nucleons in the nucleus.</p>
<p>While taking light elements like isotopes of hydrogen and not breaking them up but actually</p>
<p>fusing them together, reacting them together to produce heavier elements, typically helium,</p>
<p>which is helium is a nucleus which has two protons and two neutrons, that also releases</p>
<p>energy and that or reactions like that, making heavier elements from lighter elements is</p>
<p>what mostly powers the sun and stars.</p>
<p>Both fusion and fission release approximately a million times more energy per unit mass</p>
<p>than chemical reactions.</p>
<p>So a chemical reaction means take hydrogen, take oxygen, react them together, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>and get water, that releases energy.</p>
<p>The energy released in a chemical reaction like that or the burning of coal or on oil</p>
<p>or whatever else is about a million times less per unit mass than what is released in</p>
<p>nuclear reactions.</p>
<p>So but it&rsquo;s hard to do.</p>
<p>It requires very high energy of impact.</p>
<p>And actually, it&rsquo;s very easy to understand why.</p>
<p>And that is that those two nuclei, if they&rsquo;re both, let&rsquo;s say, hydrogen nuclei, one is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, deuterium and the other is, let&rsquo;s say, tritium, they&rsquo;re both electrically charged.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re positively charged, so they like charges repel.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that, right?</p>
<p>So basically, to get them close enough together to react, you have to overcome the repulsion,</p>
<p>the electric repulsion of the two nuclei from one another.</p>
<p>And you have to get them extremely close to one another in order for the nuclear forces</p>
<p>to overtake the electrical forces and actually form a new nucleus.</p>
<p>And so one requires very high energies of impact in order for reactions to take place.</p>
<p>And those high energies of impact correspond to very high temperatures of random motion.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why you can do something like that in the sun.</p>
<p>So we can build the sun.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one way to do it.</p>
<p>But on Earth, how do you create a fusion reaction?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, nature&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Engineering wise.</p>
<p>Nature&rsquo;s fusion reactors are indeed the stars, and they are very hot in the center.</p>
<p>And they reach the point where they release more energy from those reactions than they</p>
<p>lose by radiation and transport to the surface and so forth.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a state of ignition.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we have to achieve to give net energy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like lighting a fire.</p>
<p>If you have a bundle of sticks and you hold a match up to it and you see smoke coming</p>
<p>from the sticks, but you take the match away and the sticks just fizzle out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the reason they fizzled out is that, yes, they were burning, there was smoke</p>
<p>coming from them, but they were not ignited.</p>
<p>But if you are able to take the match away and they keep burning and they are generating</p>
<p>enough heat to keep themselves hot and hence keep the reactions going, that&rsquo;s chemical</p>
<p>ignition.</p>
<p>But what we need to do, what the stars do in order to generate nuclear fusion energy</p>
<p>is they are ignited.</p>
<p>They are generated enough energy to keep themselves hot.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve got to do on Earth if we&rsquo;re going to make fusion work on Earth.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s much harder to do on Earth than it is in a star because we need temperatures</p>
<p>of order tens of millions of degrees Celsius in order for the reactions to go fast enough</p>
<p>to generate enough energy to keep it going.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;ve got something that&rsquo;s tens of millions of degrees Celsius and you want</p>
<p>to keep it all together and keep the heat in long enough to have enough reactions taking</p>
<p>place, you can&rsquo;t just put it in a bottle, plastic or glass, it would be gone in milliseconds.</p>
<p>So you have to have some nonmaterial mechanism of confining the plasma.</p>
<p>In the case of stars, that nonmaterial force is gravity.</p>
<p>So gravity is what holds the star together, it&rsquo;s what holds the plasma in long enough</p>
<p>for it to react and sustain itself by the fusion reactions.</p>
<p>But on Earth, gravity is extremely weak.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t mean to say we don&rsquo;t fall, yes, we fall.</p>
<p>But the mutual gravitational attraction of small objects is very weak compared with the</p>
<p>electrical repulsion or any other force that you can think about on Earth.</p>
<p>And so we need a stronger force to keep the plasma together, to confine it.</p>
<p>And the predominant attempt at making fusion work on Earth is to use magnetic fields to</p>
<p>confine the plasma.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve worked on for much, essentially most of my career, is to understand how we</p>
<p>can and how best we can confine these incredibly hot gases, plasmas, using magnetic fields</p>
<p>with the ultimate objective of releasing fusion energy on Earth and generating electricity</p>
<p>with it and powering our society with it.</p>
<p>A dumb question.</p>
<p>So on top of the magnetic fields, do you also need the plastic water bottle walls or is</p>
<p>it purely magnetic fields?</p>
<p>Well, actually what we do need walls, those walls must be kept away from the plasma because</p>
<p>otherwise they&rsquo;d be melted or the plasma must be kept away from them inside of them.</p>
<p>But the main purpose of the walls is not to keep the plasma in, it&rsquo;s to keep the atmosphere</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>So if we want to do it on Earth where there&rsquo;s air, we want the plasma to consist of hydrogen</p>
<p>isotopes or other things, the things we&rsquo;re trying to react.</p>
<p>And by the way, the density of those plasmas, at least in magnetic confinement fusion, is</p>
<p>very low.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s maybe a million times less than the density of air in this room.</p>
<p>So in order for a fusion reactor like that to work, you have to keep all of the air out</p>
<p>and just keep the plasma in.</p>
<p>So yes, there are other things, but those are things that are relatively easy.</p>
<p>I mean, making a vacuum these days is technologically quite straightforward.</p>
<p>We know how to do that.</p>
<p>What we don&rsquo;t quite know how to do is to make a confinement device that isolates the plasma</p>
<p>well enough so that it&rsquo;s able to keep itself burning with its own reaction.</p>
<p>So maybe can you talk about what a tokamak is?</p>
<p>The Russian acronym from which the word tokamak is built just means toroidal magnetic chamber.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a toroidal chamber, a torus is a geometric shape which is like a doughnut with a hole</p>
<p>down the middle.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s the meat of the doughnut, that&rsquo;s the torus, and it&rsquo;s got a magnetic field.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really all tokamak means.</p>
<p>But the particular configuration that is very widespread and is the sort of best prospect</p>
<p>in the least in the near term for making fusion energy work is one in which there&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>strong magnetic field the long way around the doughnut, around the torus.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got to imagine that there&rsquo;s this doughnut shape with an embedded magnetic field</p>
<p>just going round and round the long way.</p>
<p>The big advantage of that is that plasma particles when they&rsquo;re in the presence of a magnetic</p>
<p>field feel strong forces from the magnetic field and those forces make the particles</p>
<p>gyrate around the direction of the magnetic field line.</p>
<p>So basically the particles follow helical orbits following like a spring that&rsquo;s directed</p>
<p>along the magnetic field.</p>
<p>Well if you make the magnetic field go inside this toroidal chamber and just simply go round</p>
<p>and round the chamber then because of this helical orbit the particles can&rsquo;t move fast</p>
<p>across the magnetic field but they can move very quickly along the magnetic field.</p>
<p>And if you have a magnetic field that doesn&rsquo;t leave the chamber it doesn&rsquo;t matter if they</p>
<p>move along the magnetic field it doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re going to exit the chamber.</p>
<p>But if you just had a straight magnetic field for example coming from a Helmholtz coil or</p>
<p>a bar magnet then you&rsquo;d have to have ends that would come to the ends of the chamber</p>
<p>somewhere and the particles would hit the ends and they would lose their energy.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s toroidal and that&rsquo;s why we have a strong magnetic field.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s providing a confinement against motion in the in the direction that would lead the</p>
<p>particles to leave the chamber.</p>
<p>It turns out that here we&rsquo;re getting a little bit technical but turns out that a toroidal</p>
<p>field alone is not enough and so you need more fields to produce true true confinement</p>
<p>of plasma and we get those by passing a current as well through the plasma itself.</p>
<p>I can make sure it stays on track.</p>
<p>Well that what that does is makes the field lines themselves into much bigger helices</p>
<p>and that for reasons that are too complicated to explain that clinches the confinement of</p>
<p>the particles at least in terms of their single particle orbits so they don&rsquo;t leave the chamber.</p>
<p>So when the particles are flying along this this this donut the inside of the donut are</p>
<p>they what&rsquo;s where&rsquo;s the generation of the energy coming from?</p>
<p>Are they smashing into each other?</p>
<p>Yeah eventually I mean in a fusion reactor there will be deuterons and tritons and they</p>
<p>will be smashing in.</p>
<p>They will be very hot there&rsquo;ll be a hundred million degrees Celsius or something so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>moving thermally with very large thermal energies in random directions and they will collide</p>
<p>with one another and have fusion reactions.</p>
<p>When those fusion reactions take place energy is released large amounts of energy is released</p>
<p>in the form of particles.</p>
<p>One of the particles that&rsquo;s released is an alpha particle which is also charged and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also confined and that alpha particle stays in the in the in the donut and heats the other</p>
<p>particles that are in that donut so it transfers its energy to those and they it keeps them</p>
<p>hot.</p>
<p>There are there&rsquo;s some leaking of heat all the time a little bit of radiation some transport</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a neutron released from that reaction the neutron carries out four fifths</p>
<p>of the fusion energy and that will have to be captured in a blanket that surrounds the</p>
<p>chamber in which we take the energy drive some kind of electrical generator from you</p>
<p>know thermal thermal engine gas turbine or something like that and power the power.</p>
<p>You got energy.</p>
<p>So where do we stand?</p>
<p>Where do we stand?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting this thing to be something that actually works that generates energy.</p>
<p>Well there have been experiments that have generated net nuclear energies or nuclear</p>
<p>powers in the vicinity of you know a few tens of megawatts for a few seconds.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s you know 10 megajoules that&rsquo;s not much energy it&rsquo;s a few donuts worth of energy</p>
<p>okay.</p>
<p>A literal donut.</p>
<p>But we have studied how well tokamaks can find plasmas and so we now understand in rather</p>
<p>great detail the way they work and we&rsquo;re able to predict what is going to be required in</p>
<p>order to build a tokamak that becomes self sustaining that becomes essentially ignited</p>
<p>or very so close to ignited that it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And at the moment at least if you use the modest magnetic field values still very strong</p>
<p>but limited magnetic field values you have to build a very big device.</p>
<p>And so we are at the moment worldwide fusion research is at the moment in the process of</p>
<p>building a very big experiment that&rsquo;s located in the south of France.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called ITER which means the way or just means the international tokamak experimental</p>
<p>reactor if you like.</p>
<p>And that experiment is designed to reach this burning plasma state and to generate about</p>
<p>500 megawatts of fusion power for hundreds of seconds at a time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll still only be an experiment.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t put electricity on the grid or anything like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to figure out whether it works and what the remaining engineering challenges are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a scientific experiment.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be engineered to run round the clock and so on and so forth which ultimately one</p>
<p>needs to do in order to make something that&rsquo;s practical for generating electricity.</p>
<p>But it will be the first demonstration on earth of a controlled fusion reaction for</p>
<p>you know long time periods.</p>
<p>Is that exciting to you?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been an objective that is in many ways motivated my entire career and the career</p>
<p>of many people like me in the field.</p>
<p>I have to admit though that one of the problems with ITER is that it&rsquo;s an extremely big and</p>
<p>expensive and long time to build experiment and so it won&rsquo;t even come into operation until</p>
<p>about 2025 even though it&rsquo;s been being built for 10 years and it was designed for 30 years</p>
<p>before that.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s actually one of the big disappointments of my career in a certain sense which is that</p>
<p>we won&rsquo;t get to burning fusion reaction until well past the first operation of ITER and</p>
<p>whether I&rsquo;m alive or not I don&rsquo;t know but I certainly will be well and truly retired</p>
<p>by the time that happens.</p>
<p>And so when I realized maybe some years ago that that was going to be the case it was</p>
<p>a discouragement to me let&rsquo;s put it like that.</p>
<p>But if we can try to look maybe in a ridiculous kind of way look into a hundred years from</p>
<p>now two hundred years five hundred years from now and we you know there&rsquo;s folks like Elon</p>
<p>Musk trying to travel outside the solar system.</p>
<p>I mean the amount of energy we need for some of the exciting things we want to do in this</p>
<p>world if we look again hundred years from now seems to be a very large amount.</p>
<p>So do you think fusion energy will eventually sometime into your retirement will be basically</p>
<p>behind most of the things we do?</p>
<p>Look I absolutely think that fusion research is completely justified.</p>
<p>In fact we should be spending more time and effort on it than we currently do.</p>
<p>But it isn&rsquo;t going to be a magic bullet that somehow solves all the problems of energy.</p>
<p>By the way that&rsquo;s a generic statement you can make about any energy source in my view.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a grave mistake to think that science of any sort is suddenly going to find</p>
<p>a magic bullet for meeting all the energy needs of society or any of the other needs</p>
<p>of society by the way.</p>
<p>But and we can talk about that later.</p>
<p>But fusion is very worthwhile and we should be doing it.</p>
<p>And so my disappointment that I just expressed was in a certain sense of personal disappointment.</p>
<p>I do think that fusion energy is a terrific challenge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to bring the energy source of the sun and stars down to earth.</p>
<p>This does contrast in a certain sense with fission energy.</p>
<p>By contrast fission energy efficient to build a fission reactor proved to be amazingly easy.</p>
<p>You know we did it within a few years of discovering nuclear fission.</p>
<p>People had figured out how to build a reactor and did so during the Second World War.</p>
<p>Which is by the way fission is how the current nuclear power plants work.</p>
<p>And so we have nuclear energy today because fission reactors are relatively easy to build.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s hard is getting the materials and that&rsquo;s just as well because if everyone could get</p>
<p>those materials there would be weapons proliferation and so forth.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t all that long after even the discovery of nuclear fission that fission</p>
<p>reactors were built and fission reactors of course operated before we had weapons.</p>
<p>So I think nuclear power is obviously important to meet the energy challenges of our age.</p>
<p>It is completely intrinsically completely CO2 emissions free.</p>
<p>And in fact the wastes that come from nuclear power whether it&rsquo;s fission or fusion for that</p>
<p>matter are so moderate in quantity that we shouldn&rsquo;t really be worried about them.</p>
<p>I mean yes fission products are highly radioactive and we need to keep them away from people</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s so little of them it&rsquo;s that keeping them away from people is not particularly</p>
<p>difficult.</p>
<p>And so while people complain a lot about the drawbacks of fission energy I think most of</p>
<p>those complaints are ill informed.</p>
<p>We can talk about you know the challenges and the disasters if you like of fission reactors</p>
<p>but I think fission in the near term offers a terrific opportunity for environmentally</p>
<p>friendly energy which in the world as a whole is rapidly being taken advantage of.</p>
<p>You know China and India and places like that are rapidly building fission plants.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not rapidly building fission plants in the US although we are actually building</p>
<p>two at the moment, two new ones.</p>
<p>But we do still get 20 percent of our electricity from fission energy and we could get a lot</p>
<p>more.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s clean energy.</p>
<p>Now again the concern is there&rsquo;s a very popular HBO show and just came out on Chernobyl.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the Three Mile Island, there&rsquo;s Fukushima, that&rsquo;s the most recent disaster.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a kind of a concern of yeah I mean nuclear disasters.</p>
<p>Is that, what do you make of that kind of concern especially if we look into the future</p>
<p>of fission energy based reactors?</p>
<p>Well first of all let me say one or two words about the contrast between fission and fusion</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll come on to the question of the disasters and so forth.</p>
<p>Fission does have some drawbacks and they&rsquo;re largely to do with four main areas.</p>
<p>One is do we have enough uranium or other fissile fuels to supply our energy needs for</p>
<p>a long time?</p>
<p>The answer to that is we know we have enough uranium to support fission energy worldwide</p>
<p>for thousands of years but maybe not for millions of years okay.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s resources.</p>
<p>Secondly there are issues to do with wastes.</p>
<p>Fission wastes are highly radioactive and some of them are volatile and so for example</p>
<p>in Fukushima the problem was that some fraction of the fission wastes were volatilized and</p>
<p>went out as a cloud and polluted areas with cesium 137, strontium 90 and things like that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a challenge of fission.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a problem of safety beyond that and that is that in fission it&rsquo;s hard to turn</p>
<p>the reactor off.</p>
<p>When you stop the nuclear reactions there is still a lot of heat being liberated from</p>
<p>the fission products and that is actually what the problem was at Fukushima.</p>
<p>The Fukushima reactors were shut down the moment that the earthquake took place and</p>
<p>they were shut down safely.</p>
<p>What then happened after that at Fukushima was you know there was this enormous tidal</p>
<p>wave many tens of meters high that came through and destroyed the electricity grid feed to</p>
<p>the Fukushima reactors and their cooling was then turned off and it was the after heat</p>
<p>of the turned off reactors that eventually caused the problems that led to release.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a safety concern and then finally there&rsquo;s a problem of proliferation and that</p>
<p>is that fission reactors need fissile fuel and the technologies for producing and enriching</p>
<p>and so forth the fuels can be used by bad actors to generate the materials needed for</p>
<p>a nuclear weapon and that&rsquo;s a very serious concern.</p>
<p>So those are the four problems.</p>
<p>Fusion has major advantages in respect of all of those problems.</p>
<p>It has more longer term fuel resources, it has far more benign waste issues, the radioactivity</p>
<p>from fusion reactions is at least a hundred times less than it is from fission reactions.</p>
<p>It has essentially none of this after heat problem because it doesn&rsquo;t produce fission</p>
<p>products that are highly radioactive and generating their own heat when it&rsquo;s turned off.</p>
<p>In fact the hard part of fusion is turning it on not turning it off.</p>
<p>And finally you don&rsquo;t need the same fission technology to make fusion work and so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got terrific advantages from the point of view of proliferation control.</p>
<p>So those are the four main issues which make fusion seem attractive technologically because</p>
<p>they address some of the problems of fission energy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to say that fission energy is overwhelmingly problematic but clearly there</p>
<p>have been catastrophes associated with fission reactors.</p>
<p>Fukushima actually is I think in many ways are often overstated as a disaster because</p>
<p>after all nobody was killed by the reactors essentially, zero.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s in the context of a disaster and tsunami that killed between 15 and 20,000</p>
<p>people instantane more or less instantaneously.</p>
<p>So you know in the scale of risks one should take the view that in my estimation that fission</p>
<p>energy came out of that looking pretty good.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Of course that&rsquo;s not the popular conception.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yes that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>I mean with a lot of things that threaten our well being we seem to be very bad users</p>
<p>of data.</p>
<p>We seem to be very scared of shock attacks and not at all scared of car accidents and</p>
<p>this kind of miscalculation.</p>
<p>And I think from everything I understand nuclear energy, fission based energy goes into that</p>
<p>category.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the safest, one of the cleanest forms of energy and yet the PR, whoever does</p>
<p>the PR for nuclear energy has a hard job ahead of them at the moment.</p>
<p>Well I think part of that is their association with nuclear weapons because when you say</p>
<p>the word nuclear people don&rsquo;t instantly think about nuclear energy, they think about nuclear</p>
<p>weapons.</p>
<p>And so there is perhaps a natural tendency to do that.</p>
<p>But yes I agree with you, people are very poor at estimating risks and they react emotionally</p>
<p>not rationally in most of these situations.</p>
<p>Can we talk about nuclear weapons just for a little bit?</p>
<p>So fission is the kind of reaction that&rsquo;s central to the nuclear weapons we have today?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what sets them off.</p>
<p>So if we look at the hydrogen bomb maybe you can say how these different weapons work.</p>
<p>So the earliest nuclear weapons, the nuclear bombs that were dropped on Japan etc. etc.</p>
<p>were pure fission weapons.</p>
<p>They used enriched uranium or plutonium and their energy is essentially entirely derived</p>
<p>from fission reactions.</p>
<p>But it was early realized that more energy was available if one could somehow combine</p>
<p>a fission bomb with fusion reactions.</p>
<p>Because the fusion reactions give more energy per unit mass than fission reactions.</p>
<p>And this was called the super, you might have heard of the expression the super or more</p>
<p>simply hydrogen bombs.</p>
<p>Bombs which use isotopes of hydrogen and the fusion reactions associated with them.</p>
<p>Like you said it&rsquo;s hard to turn on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to turn on because you need very high temperatures and you need confinement</p>
<p>of that long enough for the reactions to take place.</p>
<p>And so a bomb actually, a thermonuclear bomb or a hydrogen bomb has essentially a chemical</p>
<p>implosion which then sets off a fission explosion which then sets off and compresses hydrogen</p>
<p>isotopes and other things, which I don&rsquo;t know because I&rsquo;ve never had a security clearance.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t betray any secrets about weapons because I&rsquo;ve never been party to them because</p>
<p>I know a lot about this problem I can guess.</p>
<p>And sets off fusion reactions in the middle.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s basically it&rsquo;s that sequence of things which produce these enormous multi</p>
<p>megaton bombs that have very large yields.</p>
<p>And so fusion alone can&rsquo;t get you there.</p>
<p>It is actually possible to set off or to try to set off little fusion bombs alone without</p>
<p>the surrounding fission explosion and that is what is called laser fusion.</p>
<p>So another approach to fusion which actually is mostly researched in the weapons complex,</p>
<p>the national labs and so forth because it&rsquo;s more associated with the technologies of weapons</p>
<p>is inertial fusion.</p>
<p>So if you decide instead of trying to make your plasma just sit there in this Taurus</p>
<p>and in the tokamak and be controlled steady state with a magnetic field, if you&rsquo;re willing</p>
<p>to accept that I&rsquo;ll just set off an explosion and then I&rsquo;ll gather the energy from that</p>
<p>somehow I don&rsquo;t quite know how but let&rsquo;s not ask that question too much.</p>
<p>Then it is possible to imagine generating fusion alone explosions and the way you do</p>
<p>it is you take some small amount of deuterium tritium fuel you bombard it with energy from</p>
<p>all sides and this is what the lasers are used for extremely powerful at lasers which</p>
<p>compresses the pellet of fusion and heats it.</p>
<p>It compresses it to such a high density and temperature that the reactions take place</p>
<p>very very quickly and in fact they can take place so quickly that it&rsquo;s all over with before</p>
<p>the thing flies apart.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And that is.</p>
<p>Heated up really fast.</p>
<p>That is inertial fusion okay.</p>
<p>Is that useful for energy generation for outside?</p>
<p>Not yet I mean there are those people who think it will be but you may have heard of</p>
<p>the big experiment called the National Ignition Facility which was built at Livermore starting</p>
<p>in the late 1990s and has been in operation since around about 2010.</p>
<p>It was designed with the claim that it would reach ignition fusion ignition in this pulsed</p>
<p>form where the reactions have got over with so quickly before the thing whole thing flies</p>
<p>apart.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t actually reach ignition and it doesn&rsquo;t look as if it will although you know we never</p>
<p>know maybe people figure out how to make it work better.</p>
<p>But the answer is in principle it seems possible to reach ignition in this way maybe not with</p>
<p>that particular laser facility.</p>
<p>Are you surprised that we humans haven&rsquo;t destroyed ourselves given that we&rsquo;ve invented such powerful</p>
<p>tools of destruction?</p>
<p>Like what do you make of the fact that for many decades we&rsquo;ve had nuclear weapons now</p>
<p>speaking about estimating risk at least to me it&rsquo;s exceptionally surprising I was born</p>
<p>in the Soviet Union that big egos of the big leaders when rubbing up against each other</p>
<p>have not created the kind of destruction everybody was afraid of for decades.</p>
<p>Well I must say I&rsquo;m extremely thankful that it hasn&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;m surprised</p>
<p>about it I&rsquo;ve never thought about it and from the point of view of is it surprising that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve we&rsquo;ve avoided it I&rsquo;m just very thankful that we have I think that there is a sense</p>
<p>in which cooler heads have prevailed at crucial moments I think there is also a sense in which</p>
<p>you know mutually assured destruction has in fact worked as a policy to restrain the</p>
<p>great powers from going to war and in fact you know the the the fact that we haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>had a world war you know since the 1940s is perhaps even attributable to nuclear weapons</p>
<p>in a kind of strange and peculiar way but I think humans are deeply flawed and sinful</p>
<p>people and I certainly don&rsquo;t feel that we&rsquo;re guaranteed that it&rsquo;s going to go on like this.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about the sort of the biggest picture view of it all but let me just ask</p>
<p>in terms of your worries of if we look a hundred years from now we&rsquo;re in the middle of what</p>
<p>is now a natural pandemic that from the looks of it as fortunately as not as bad as it could</p>
<p>possibly been if you look at the Spanish flu if you look at the history of pandemics if</p>
<p>you look at all the possible pandemics that could have been that folks like Bill Gates</p>
<p>are exceptionally terrified about we&rsquo;ve I know many people are suffering but it&rsquo;s better</p>
<p>than it could have been so and now we&rsquo;re talking about nuclear weapons in terms of existential</p>
<p>threats to us as sinful humans what worries you the most is it nuclear weapons is is it</p>
<p>natural pandemics engineered pandemics nanotechnology in my field of artificial intelligence some</p>
<p>people are afraid of killer robots and robots yeah is there do you think in those existential</p>
<p>terms and do any aspect to any of those things were you I am certainly not confident that</p>
<p>my children and grandchildren will experience the benefits of civilization that I have enjoyed</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s possible for our civilizations to break down catastrophically I also think</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s possible for our civilizations to break down progressively and I think they</p>
<p>will if we continue to have the explosion of population on the planet that we currently</p>
<p>have I mean it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s quite it&rsquo;s quite wrong to think of our problems as mostly being co2</p>
<p>if we can just solve co2 then we can go on having this you know continually expanding</p>
<p>economy everywhere in the world of course you can&rsquo;t do that okay I mean there is a finite</p>
<p>you know bearing capacity of our planet on the resources of our planet on the resources</p>
<p>of our planet and and we can&rsquo;t continue to do that so I think there are lots of technical</p>
<p>reasons why a continually expanding economy and and and civilization is impossible and</p>
<p>therefore actually I&rsquo;m as much nervous about the fact that our population is eight billion</p>
<p>or something right now worldwide as I am about the fact that you know a few million people</p>
<p>would be would be killed by COVID 19 I mean I don&rsquo;t want to be callous about this but</p>
<p>from the big picture it seems like that&rsquo;s much more of a problem over population people</p>
<p>not dying is ultimately more of a problem than people dying so you know that probably</p>
<p>sounds incredibly callous to your listeners but I think it&rsquo;s simply you know a sober assessment</p>
<p>of the situation is there is there ways from the way those eight billion or seven billion</p>
<p>or whatever the number is live that could make it sustainable you know because you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>kind of implied there&rsquo;s a kind of we have especially in the West this kind of capitalist</p>
<p>view of really consuming a lot of resources is there a way to like if you could change</p>
<p>one thing or a few things what would you change to make this life make it more likely that</p>
<p>your grandchildren have a better life than you well okay so let&rsquo;s talk a bit about energy</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s something I know a lot a lot about having thought about it most of my career</p>
<p>in order to reach steady state co2 level okay that&rsquo;s acceptable in terms of global climate</p>
<p>change and so on and so forth we need to reduce our carbon emissions by at least a factor</p>
<p>of ten worldwide okay what&rsquo;s more you know the average energy consumption and hence co2</p>
<p>emission of people in the world is less than a tenth of what we per capita of them what</p>
<p>we have in the West in America and Europe and so forth so if you have in mind some utopia</p>
<p>in the future where we&rsquo;ve reached a sustainable use of energy and we&rsquo;ve also reached a situation</p>
<p>in which there is far less inequity in the world in the sense that people have share</p>
<p>the energy resources more uniformly then what that is equivalent to would be to reduce the</p>
<p>co2 emissions in Western economies not by a factor of ten but by a factor of a hundred</p>
<p>in other words has to go down to one percent of what it is now okay so you know when people</p>
<p>talk about you know let&rsquo;s use natural gas because you know maybe it only uses sixty</p>
<p>percent of the energy of coal it&rsquo;s complete nonsense that&rsquo;s not not even scratching the</p>
<p>surface of what we would need to do so you know is that going to be feasible I very much</p>
<p>doubt it and therefore I actually doubt that we can reach a level of energy of fossil energy</p>
<p>use that is one percent of the current use in the West without totally dramatic changes</p>
<p>either in you know our society our use of of energy and so forth which actually of course</p>
<p>is much of that energy is used for producing food and so on and so forth so it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>not so obvious that we can we can get we can cut down our energy usage by that factor or</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got to reduce the human population so you run up against that number that&rsquo;s increasing</p>
<p>still and you don&rsquo;t think that could be it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not depressing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s difficult like many truths are do you have a hope that there could be a technological</p>
<p>solution in short no there is no technological solution to for example for population control</p>
<p>I mean we have the technology just you know to prevent ourselves bearing children that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a problem technology is in okay solved the challenge is society the challenge is</p>
<p>human choices the challenge is almost entirely human and sociological not technology not</p>
<p>technology and when people thought talk about energy they thought they think that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some kind of technological magic bullet for this but there isn&rsquo;t okay and and there isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>for the reasons I just mentioned not because it&rsquo;s obvious there isn&rsquo;t but actually there</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t and and in in any case that it&rsquo;s true of energy it&rsquo;s true of pollution it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>of human population it&rsquo;s true of most of the big challenges in our society are not scientific</p>
<p>or technological challenges they&rsquo;re human sociological challenges and that&rsquo;s why I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a terrible mistake even for folks like me who work at you know well the high temple</p>
<p>of science and technology in in America and maybe in the galaxy yeah I mean you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s MIT it&rsquo;s at MIT best university in the world it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a terrible mistake if we give</p>
<p>the impression that technology is going to solve it all technology will make tremendous</p>
<p>contributions and I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s worth working on it but it&rsquo;s a disaster if you think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to solve all of our problems and and actually you know I&rsquo;ve written a whole</p>
<p>book about the question of of scientism and the and the over emphasis on science both</p>
<p>as a way of of solving problems through technology but also as a way of gaining knowledge I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not all the knowledge there is either yeah I think that book and your journey there</p>
<p>is fascinating so maybe you can go there can can you tell me about your on a personal side</p>
<p>your the personal journey of your faith of Christianity and your relationship with with</p>
<p>God with religion in general yeah in my in my latest book Can a Scientist Believe in</p>
<p>Miracles I I give a first I devote most of the first chapter to telling how how I became</p>
<p>a Christian why I became a Christian I I didn&rsquo;t grow up as a Christian which is fascinating</p>
<p>I mean you didn&rsquo;t grow up as a Christian so you you&rsquo;ve discovered the beauty of God and</p>
<p>physics at the same time concurrent that&rsquo;s a very poetic way of putting it but yes I</p>
<p>would accept that I became a Christian when I was an undergraduate at Cambridge University</p>
<p>I I had you know I had gone to a school in which there was religion kind of was part</p>
<p>of the society there were prayers and at the at the at the daily you know gathering of</p>
<p>the of the students of the assembly of the students but I but I didn&rsquo;t really believe</p>
<p>it I just sort of went along with it and it wasn&rsquo;t particularly you know aggressive or</p>
<p>benign you know benign it just sort of was there but I didn&rsquo;t believe it I didn&rsquo;t didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make much sense to me but when I but I came across Christians from time to time and when</p>
<p>I went to Cambridge University two of my closest friends turned out were Christians and I think</p>
<p>it was that was the most important influence on me that that here were two people who were</p>
<p>really smart like me I&rsquo;m giving you my yeah my impressions the way I the way I felt at</p>
<p>the time and and they thought Christianity made sense and and you know testified to its</p>
<p>significance in their lives and so that was a very important influence on me and I and</p>
<p>ultimately I mean the reason I I hadn&rsquo;t I hadn&rsquo;t I didn&rsquo;t see Christianity as some</p>
<p>kind of great evil the way it&rsquo;s sometimes portrayed by the by the radical atheists of</p>
<p>this century I mean I think that&rsquo;s nonsense but but but I so I think there were certain</p>
<p>attractive things if you go to a university like Cambridge you know you&rsquo;re surrounded</p>
<p>by by by Western culture you know from from about you know the 15th century onwards and</p>
<p>that saturated with Christian art and architecture and so forth and so it&rsquo;s hard it&rsquo;s hard not</p>
<p>to recognize that Christianity is in fact the foundation of Western society in Western</p>
<p>culture most Western civilization so so I mean maybe I was in that sense favorably disposed</p>
<p>towards Christianity as a religion but as a personal faith it didn&rsquo;t mean anything</p>
<p>to me but I became convinced really of two things one is that the evidence for the resurrection</p>
<p>of Jesus Christ is actually rather good I mean it&rsquo;s not a proof it&rsquo;s not kind of some</p>
<p>some kind of scientific demonstrate or mathematical demonstration but it&rsquo;s actually extremely</p>
<p>good it&rsquo;s not scientific evidence by and large it&rsquo;s historical evidence historical evidence</p>
<p>yeah so that was one thing and the other thing that came to me when I was at Cambridge it</p>
<p>became clear that Christianity ultimately is not you know some kind of moral theory</p>
<p>or philosophy or something like that it is or elite or at least it claims to be a personal</p>
<p>relationship with God which is made possible you know by what Jesus did and on the cross</p>
<p>and his life and his teaching and and it&rsquo;s a personal call to a relationship with God</p>
<p>and that had I&rsquo;d never thought of it in those terms when I was you know when I was younger</p>
<p>and that that thought became attractive to me I mean I think most people find the person</p>
<p>of Christ and just teachings you know compelling insert in a certain sense what do you mean</p>
<p>by personal do you mean personal for you like a relationship like it&rsquo;s a meditative</p>
<p>like you specifically you Ian have a connection with God and and then the other side you say</p>
<p>personal with the actual body the person of Jesus Christ so all of those things what do</p>
<p>you mean by personal connection and why that was well so as I&rsquo;m sorry for the stupid questions</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s okay no problem as a Christian I believe that I have a relationship with God which</p>
<p>is best expressed by saying that it&rsquo;s personal and that comes about because you know Jesus</p>
<p>through his acts has reconciled me with God me a sinner me someone full of sins of failings</p>
<p>of ways in which I don&rsquo;t live up to even my own ideals let alone the ideals of a holy</p>
<p>God have been reconciled to the creator of everything and and so Christians myself included</p>
<p>believe that prayer is in a certain sense a connection with God and there are times</p>
<p>when I have felt you know that God spoke to me I don&rsquo;t mean necessarily orally in words</p>
<p>but showed me things or enlighten me or inspired me in ways that I I attribute to him so I</p>
<p>see it as a as a two way you know relationship in a certain sense of course it&rsquo;s a very asymmetrical</p>
<p>relationship but nevertheless Christians think that it&rsquo;s a two way it&rsquo;s a two way street</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not just talking into the air when we say we won&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m going to pray for someone</p>
<p>in this two way communication is there a way that you could try to describe on a podcast</p>
<p>what is God what is God like in your view if you try to describe is it a force is it</p>
<p>a set is it a for you intellectually is a set of metaphors that you use to reason about</p>
<p>the world is it is it is it kind of a computer that does some computation that&rsquo;s the infinitely</p>
<p>powerful computer or is it like Santa Claus a guy with a with a beard on the cloud like</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t mean what God actually is I mean in your limited cognitive capacity</p>
<p>as a human what do you actually what do you find helpful for thinking of what God actually</p>
<p>looks like what is God well let me start by saying none of the above okay I mean clearly</p>
<p>God in the Christian God the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob etc it is is not any of those</p>
<p>things because all of those things you just mentioned are phenomena or or or entities</p>
<p>in the created world and the most fundamental thing about monotheism as you know Abraham</p>
<p>and Moses and so forth handed it down is that God is not an entity within the creation within</p>
<p>the universe that God is the creator of it all and that&rsquo;s what Genesis first two chapters</p>
<p>of Genesis is really about is it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not about telling us you know how God created</p>
<p>the world it&rsquo;s about telling us and telling the early Hebrews that God created the world</p>
<p>okay and that therefore he is not you know simply an entity within it on the other hand</p>
<p>you know our finite minds have a pretty hard time encompassing that so so one has to therefore</p>
<p>work in terms of metaphors and images and and so forth and I think we would know very</p>
<p>little about who God is if we if it was simply up if we were simply left to our own devices</p>
<p>you know if if we were just you know here you are you&rsquo;re in the universe try to figure</p>
<p>out who made it and and so forth well you know philosophers think they can do a little</p>
<p>bit of that maybe and theologians think that they can do a little bit more but but Christians</p>
<p>think that God has actually helped us along a lot by revealing himself and and we say</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s revealed himself supremely in the person of Jesus Christ and so you know when</p>
<p>Jesus says to his disciples if you&rsquo;ve seen me you&rsquo;ve seen the Father then that is in</p>
<p>a certain sense a watchword for answering this question for Christians it is that supremely</p>
<p>if we want to help ourselves understand who God really is we look to Jesus we look to</p>
<p>what he did we look to what he said and so forth and we believe that he is one with the</p>
<p>Father and that&rsquo;s why we believe you know in the Trinity I mean it&rsquo;s basically because</p>
<p>that revelation is extremely central to Christian belief and teaching so in that in that sense</p>
<p>through Jesus there was a that&rsquo;s kind of a historical moment that&rsquo;s profound that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really powerful do you also think that God makes himself seen in less obvious ways in</p>
<p>our world today absolutely absolutely I mean it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s certainly been the outlook of Jews</p>
<p>and Christians throughout history that God is seen in the creation that we when we look</p>
<p>at the creation we see to some extent the wonder the majesty the might of the person</p>
<p>or the entity but the person who created it and and that&rsquo;s a way in which scientists</p>
<p>particularly have over over the ages and certainly over most of the last five centuries since</p>
<p>the scientific revolution scientists have seen in a certain sense the hand of God in</p>
<p>creation I mean this leads us perhaps to a different discussion but I mean it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>remarkable to me how influential Christianity and religion in generally has been in science</p>
<p>yeah most of the scientists through history as if you described I mean God has been a</p>
<p>very big part of their life and their work certainly up until the at the beginning of</p>
<p>the 20th century that was the case so maybe this is a good time to can you tell me what</p>
<p>scientism is yeah I mean the short answer is that by scientism we mean we mean the</p>
<p>belief that science is all the real knowledge there is that&rsquo;s a shorthand there are lots</p>
<p>of different facets of it and what which one can explore and the book in which I explored</p>
<p>it most most thoroughly was actually an earlier book called monopolizing knowledge and and</p>
<p>the purpose of that title is to is to draw attention to the fact that in our society</p>
<p>as a whole in particularly in the West today we we have grown so reliant on science that</p>
<p>we that we tend to put aside other ways of getting to know things and so of course at</p>
<p>MIT we are focused on science and we do focus on it very much but the truth is that there</p>
<p>are many ways of getting to know things in our world know things reliably in our world</p>
<p>and a lot of them are not science so scientism in my view is a terrible intellectual error</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s to believe it&rsquo;s the belief that somehow the methods of science as we develop them</p>
<p>with you know experiments and in the end they it relies particularly upon reproducibility</p>
<p>in the world and on a kind of clarity that comes from measurements and mathematics and</p>
<p>related types of of skills those powerful though they are for finding out about the</p>
<p>world are not all the knowledge do not give us all the knowledge we we have and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>many other forms of knowledge and the illustration that I usually use to to try to help people</p>
<p>to think about this is to say well look let&rsquo;s think about human history I mean to what extent</p>
<p>can human history be discovered scientifically the answer is essentially can&rsquo;t because and</p>
<p>the reason is because human history is not reproducible you can&rsquo;t do reproducible experiments</p>
<p>or observations and and go back and you know try it over again it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a one off thing</p>
<p>you know the history is full of unique events and and so you you know you you can&rsquo;t hope</p>
<p>to do history using the methods of science yeah I mean in some sense history is a story</p>
<p>of miracles I mean they don&rsquo;t have to do with God it&rsquo;s just uniqueness is anyway unique</p>
<p>events unique events and that science doesn&rsquo;t like that because it&rsquo;s unique events by their</p>
<p>very definition are not reproducible can I ask sort of a tricky question I don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>know what atheist or atheism is but is it possible for somebody to be an atheist and</p>
<p>avoid slipping into scientism oh yeah absolutely I mean it I mean there these are two separate</p>
<p>things okay I&rsquo;m quite sure there are many people who don&rsquo;t believe in God and yet recognize</p>
<p>that there are many different ways of we get knowledge you know some is history some is</p>
<p>sociology economics politics philosophy art history language literature etc etc there</p>
<p>are many people who recognize those disciplines as having their own approaches to epistemology</p>
<p>and to get how we get knowledge and valuing them very highly I don&rsquo;t mean to say that</p>
<p>everyone you know who&rsquo;s an atheist automatically you know subscribes to the scientistic viewpoint</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not true but it&rsquo;s certainly the case that many of the arguments in fact most of</p>
<p>the arguments of the aggressive atheists of this century people are sometimes called new</p>
<p>atheists although they&rsquo;re actually rather old most of their arguments are rather old</p>
<p>you know are drawing heavily on scientism so when they say things like there&rsquo;s no evidence</p>
<p>to support Christianity okay what they are really focusing on is to say is saying that</p>
<p>Christianity isn&rsquo;t proved or the evidence for Christianity is not science okay science</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t prove it and and you you know if you read their books that&rsquo;s what you find they</p>
<p>really mean is science doesn&rsquo;t lead you necessarily to believe in a creator God or into it in</p>
<p>any particular in religion I accept that that&rsquo;s not a problem to me because I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that science is all the knowledge there is and I think there are other important ways</p>
<p>of getting to know things and one of them is historical for example and I mentioned</p>
<p>earlier that I think I became persuaded and I were and I still am persuaded that the historical</p>
<p>evidence for the resurrection is very is very persuasive again it&rsquo;s not proof or anything</p>
<p>like that but it&rsquo;s but it&rsquo;s pretty good evidence okay yeah I&rsquo;ve um I talked to Richard Dawkins</p>
<p>on this podcast and um uh and uh I saw you debate with Sean Carroll so I I understand</p>
<p>this world it makes it makes me very curious maybe uh let me ask sort of another way my</p>
<p>own kind of uh world view maybe you can help as by way of therapy understand um you know</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve kind of said that there&rsquo;s other ways of knowing what about if we if if I kind</p>
<p>of sit here and am cognizant of the fact that I almost don&rsquo;t know anything so sort of I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sitting here almost paralyzed by the the mystery of it all and it&rsquo;s not even when you say there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other ways of knowing it um it feels almost too confident to me because uh yeah when I</p>
<p>when I listen to beautiful music or uh see art there&rsquo;s something there that&rsquo;s and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>uh that&rsquo;s beyond the reach of scientism I would say so beyond the reach of uh the the</p>
<p>tools of science but I don&rsquo;t even feel like that could be as an actual tool of knowing</p>
<p>it um yeah I just don&rsquo;t even know where to begin because it just feels like we know so</p>
<p>little like uh if we look even a hundred years from now when people look back to this time</p>
<p>humans look back to this time they&rsquo;ll probably laugh at how little we knew even a hundred</p>
<p>years from now and if we look at a thousand years from now hopefully we&rsquo;re still alive</p>
<p>or some version of ourselves or AI version of ourselves you know they they&rsquo;ll certainly</p>
<p>laugh at the absurdity of our beliefs so what do you uh so you don&rsquo;t seem to be as paralyzed</p>
<p>by how little we know you confidently push on forward but what do you make of that sense</p>
<p>of uh of just not knowing of the mystery we need to be modest or or humble if even about</p>
<p>what we know I accept that and I certainly think that&rsquo;s true not not simply because in</p>
<p>the future we&rsquo;ll know more science and and there will be more powerful ways of finding</p>
<p>out about things but simply because you know sometimes we&rsquo;re not right we&rsquo;re wrong okay</p>
<p>in what we think we know um uh so that&rsquo;s crucial but it&rsquo;s also a very Christian outlook that</p>
<p>kind of humility is what Jesus taught so I so I don&rsquo;t know whether this was in the back</p>
<p>of your mind when you were thinking about this but it&rsquo;s often the case that um people</p>
<p>of religious faith are are accused of being dogmatists okay and there is a sense in which</p>
<p>dogma teaching accepted teaching is is part of religions okay but I don&rsquo;t think that</p>
<p>necessarily uh uh that leads one to blind dogmatism and I don&rsquo;t I certainly don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that faith we can talk about this later if you&rsquo;d like but I certainly don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that faith means thinking you know something and not listening to counter arguments for</p>
<p>example um so I I think that&rsquo;s crucial yeah what is uh what does faith mean to you what</p>
<p>does it uh feel like what does it actually sort of how do you carry your faith in terms</p>
<p>of the way you see the world well I think faith is very often misunderstood in our society</p>
<p>at the moment um because uh it&rsquo;s often portrayed as being nothing other than uh believing things</p>
<p>you know ain&rsquo;t true you know um or or believing things that are are are not proven okay um</p>
<p>and um and this and faith does have a strand which is to do with you know basically believing</p>
<p>in um in concepts or um propositions but actually the the word faith is much broader than that</p>
<p>faith also means um you know trusting in something trusting in a person or trusting in a thing</p>
<p>uh the reliability of some technology for example um that&rsquo;s equally part of the meaning</p>
<p>of the word faith and and there&rsquo;s a third strand to the to the meaning of the word as</p>
<p>well and that is loyalty um so you know I have faith in my wife and and I try to act</p>
<p>in faith towards her and that&rsquo;s a kind of loyalty and so those three strands are the</p>
<p>are the most important strands of the meaning of faith yes belief in uh in propositions</p>
<p>that we might not have you know full proof about or maybe we have very little proof about</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also trust and and loyalty and actually in the in terms of the Christian faith Christians</p>
<p>are far more called to trust and loyalty than they are to belief in things they don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>know don&rsquo;t have proof of okay um but but the critics of religion generally um tend to emphasize</p>
<p>the first one and say well you know you believe things for which you have no evidence okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s what they think faith is well yeah there there is a sense in which</p>
<p>everybody has to live their lives uh believing or or or making decisions in situations when</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have all the proof or evidence or knowledge that enables you to make a completely</p>
<p>um rational or well informed or prudent decision we you know we do this all the time you know</p>
<p>my drive down here I nearly took a wrong turning and I thought which which which way do I go</p>
<p>do I keep going straight on and so my uh voice came out and I think go straight okay so so</p>
<p>you have to make decisions and sometimes you know you don&rsquo;t have a navigation system telling</p>
<p>you what to do you just have to make that decision with no with insufficient evidence</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing it all the time as a human and that&rsquo;s part of being sentient um and so</p>
<p>that kind of um action and belief on the basis of incomplete evidence is not something that</p>
<p>I feel uncomfortable doing or I feel that I feel that somehow my Christian commitments</p>
<p>are forced me to do when I wouldn&rsquo;t have had to have done it otherwise I would have had</p>
<p>to do it anyway um and and so you know there&rsquo;s a sense in which um I think it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to see the breadth of meaning of faith and and and to recognize that in certainly in</p>
<p>the case of Christianity um it&rsquo;s trust and loyalty that the the key themes that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>called to and I mean another interesting extension of that that you speak to is kind of loyalty</p>
<p>is referring to a connection with something outside of yourself yeah um so I think you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>spoken about like existentialism or even just atheism in general as um as leading naturally</p>
<p>to an individualism as a focus on the on the self and uh ideas that maybe the Christian</p>
<p>faith can um instill in you is um allowing you to sort of look outside of yourself so</p>
<p>connection I mean loyalty fundamentally is about other beings um and yeah other beings</p>
<p>and I mean I think I don&rsquo;t know what it is in me but I&rsquo;m very much drawn to that idea</p>
<p>and um I think humans in general are drawn to that idea you can you can make all kinds</p>
<p>of evolutionary arguments all that kind of stuff but uh people always kind of tease me</p>
<p>uh because I talk about love a lot and I mean there&rsquo;s a lot of uh non scientific things</p>
<p>about love right like what the heck is that thing why why do we even need that thing it</p>
<p>uh it seems to be an annoying burden that uh that we we get so much uh joy in in life</p>
<p>from a connection with other human beings deep uh lasting connections with human beings</p>
<p>same thing with loyalty why why do we get so much value and pleasure and strength and</p>
<p>meaning from loyalty from a connection with somebody else uh going through uh thick and</p>
<p>thin with somebody else going through some hard times I mean some of the you know the</p>
<p>closest friends I I have is going through some some rough times together and that seems</p>
<p>to make life deeply meaningful what is that so yeah um I that&rsquo;s that resonates with me</p>
<p>and I obviously I would I would affirm it um I think just to just to correct the implication</p>
<p>that you made I I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessarily the the consequence of atheism uh that we</p>
<p>that we lose track of those kinds of things I I mean I think that atheists can be loyal</p>
<p>okay if you like um the question more often comes up in the context of you know where</p>
<p>does morality come from and loyalty I think and duty are related to one another you know</p>
<p>if we have loyalty to someone then we have a duty to them okay as well and I think that</p>
<p>insofar as we see ourselves as having some kinds any kinds of duties or moral compulsions</p>
<p>with respect to our relationships to other people it&rsquo;s I think it&rsquo;s a question that always</p>
<p>arises well where does these where do these come from and there there are various approaches</p>
<p>that people have towards deciding what makes ethics or or morality moral okay but I do</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s the case that um it&rsquo;s very hard to ground morality um in a in any kind of</p>
<p>absolute way or a persuasive way um in mere human relationships and so it&rsquo;s certainly</p>
<p>the case that in Christianity um there is a sense in which um morality and you know</p>
<p>the morality of morals comes from a transcendent place from a transcendent deity and that we</p>
<p>um that we ground are the compelling force of of morals on God are more than we do on</p>
<p>individuals because after all you know if it if you if you&rsquo;ve got nothing but you know</p>
<p>other people why should you you know treat your neighbor well why shouldn&rsquo;t you defraud</p>
<p>your neighbor if it&rsquo;s good for you well you know you can construct all kinds of arguments</p>
<p>and some of them are you know obviously arguments that are commonplace in religion too you should</p>
<p>do as you would be done by and all this kind of thing right but none of that seems any</p>
<p>any more than mere pragmatism to most people okay and so that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>things if that Nietzsche amongst others you know really identified you know if God is</p>
<p>dead if the idea of God is grounding our moral behavior is no longer viable in the West which</p>
<p>Nietzsche thought that it wasn&rsquo;t okay then what does ground it and he had no good answer</p>
<p>for it in fact he claimed there was no answer but then he couldn&rsquo;t live with that and so</p>
<p>he invented the idea of the ubermensch you know this this superior human being okay and</p>
<p>this was a different way of trying to ground morality not a very successful one you know</p>
<p>you could argue that it&rsquo;s a forerunner of the sort of racism of Hitler&rsquo;s regime and</p>
<p>so forth that you know we&rsquo;ve in the West thankfully shied away from in the in the past</p>
<p>half or three quarters of a century but you know I think it is the case that Christianity</p>
<p>gives me a basis for my moral beliefs that is more than mere pragmatism yeah but there</p>
<p>is a stepping outside of all that there does seem to be a powerful stabilizing like we</p>
<p>humans are able to hold ideas together like in a distributed way outside of whether God</p>
<p>exists or not or any that just our ability to kind of converge together towards a set</p>
<p>of beliefs into sometimes into tribes it&rsquo;s kind of I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s inherent to being</p>
<p>human beings I hope not because now if I look on Twitter and there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s the red team</p>
<p>and the blue team right it&rsquo;s almost like it&rsquo;s a care it&rsquo;s some kind of TV show that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>living in that people get into these tribes and they hold a set of beliefs that sometimes</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t I mean they are beliefs for the sake of holding those beliefs and we get this intimate</p>
<p>connection between each other for sharing those beliefs and we spoke to the things about</p>
<p>loyalty and love and that&rsquo;s the thing that people feel inside the tribe and it seems</p>
<p>very human that within that tribe those beliefs don&rsquo;t necessarily always have to be connected</p>
<p>to anything it&rsquo;s just the fact that you know I&rsquo;ve did sports my whole life whenever you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on a team the bond you get with it with other people on the team is incredible and the actual</p>
<p>sport is often the silliest I mean I don&rsquo;t play ball sports anymore but the ball when</p>
<p>I played like soccer or tennis I mean all those sports are silly right you&rsquo;re playing</p>
<p>with a little ball but there&rsquo;s the bond you get is so deeply meaningful I just it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>to me on the sociological level that it&rsquo;s possible to me whatever the beliefs of religion</p>
<p>is whatever they&rsquo;re actually grounded in they might be they might have a power in themselves</p>
<p>I think there is tribalism everywhere and I think tribalism in the US at the moment</p>
<p>is rather difficult to bear from my point of view and it&rsquo;s I think fed by the internet</p>
<p>and social media and so forth but it&rsquo;s but historically tribalism has been a trait and</p>
<p>remains a trait in humans the genius of Christianity is that it supersedes tribalism I mean yes</p>
<p>when the Hebrews thought about Yahweh initially they thought about him as their tribal deity</p>
<p>just like the tribal deities round about about them and so but and and yet from you know</p>
<p>early on in Hebrew history the crucial thing that Yahweh came to mean or I would say revealed</p>
<p>of himself to them was that he wasn&rsquo;t just a tribal deity he was the God that created</p>
<p>the whole thing and if he is the God of the whole thing then he&rsquo;s not just the God of</p>
<p>the Hebrews or in the case of you know Americans God is not just the God of Americans he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the God of everybody okay and that is a way in a way the most amazing transcending of</p>
<p>tribal loyalties and one of the crucial you know occasions in the New Testament you know</p>
<p>when the Holy Spirit comes at Pentecost you know the the apostles and the and the disciples</p>
<p>speak in other tongues and there are people from all all the countries you know round</p>
<p>about hear them in their own languages and so you know whether whether you take that</p>
<p>as factual or not that is the a statement of the transcendent aspects of Christianity</p>
<p>or the claimed transcendent aspects of Christianity that it transcends culture and that&rsquo;s certainly</p>
<p>something which I find appealing.</p>
<p>When I kind of touch on this topic in my own mind one of the hardest questions is as why</p>
<p>is there suffering in the world do you have a good answer well I have I have some answers</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re right that it is one of the toughest questions the problem of pain or the problem</p>
<p>of suffering or the problem of theodicy as as theologians call it is is is probably one</p>
<p>of the toughest I think it&rsquo;s important to say that there are certain types of answers</p>
<p>to this question but there are aspects of this question to which there is no intellectual</p>
<p>answer that is going to satisfy and and the fact of the matter is you know when I&rsquo;m speaking</p>
<p>to an audience let&rsquo;s say at at at some kind of lecture I can be sure that there are people</p>
<p>in that audience who are either personally suffering they&rsquo;ve got illness they&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>pains there maybe they&rsquo;re facing death or someone in their family is in similar sorts</p>
<p>of situations so suffering is a reality and and there is nothing that I can say that is</p>
<p>going to solve their feeling of agony and angst and and maybe despair in those types</p>
<p>of situations there is really only one thing that I think humans can do for one another</p>
<p>in those kinds of situations and that is simply to be there to be there alongside your friend</p>
<p>or your or your colleague or or whoever you know family member or whoever it might be</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the only really sense in which we can give comfort if we try to give intellectual</p>
<p>solutions to these problems we&rsquo;re going to be like like the comforters that were in the</p>
<p>book of Job in the in the Bible who who brought no comfort to Job himself with their intellectual</p>
<p>answers but if they had been there and some of them were there they sat alongside that</p>
<p>is some level of comfort and and after all that&rsquo;s the meaning of the word compassion</p>
<p>it means to suffer alongside of somebody and I would say first off you know what does a</p>
<p>Christian say about suffering the the first thing a Christian should say is compassion</p>
<p>is all that really counts and what&rsquo;s more we say that God has acted in compassion towards</p>
<p>us that is to say he has suffered with us in the person of Jesus Christ and when we</p>
<p>see the passion of Jesus we recognize that God takes suffering deadly seriously has taken</p>
<p>it so seriously that he&rsquo;s been willing to come and be a part of his creation in the</p>
<p>person of of Jesus Christ and suffer death the most horrible death on the cross and for</p>
<p>our benefit so that&rsquo;s one side of of suffering but the question you know the philosophical</p>
<p>question remains you know surely if God is good you know and God is omnipotent benevolent</p>
<p>you know why doesn&rsquo;t he take away all the suffering why doesn&rsquo;t he cause miracles to</p>
<p>occur that will take away all this suffering I think there are some good answers to that</p>
<p>question in the in the following sense that you know we live in a world where the consistency</p>
<p>of the world is an absolutely crucial part of it you know the fact that our world behaves</p>
<p>reproducibly in the main is absolutely essential for the integrity of our lives without it</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t exist okay and so there is a sense in which the integrity of creation calls for</p>
<p>there being consistent behavior which you know these days we think of as being the laws</p>
<p>of nature okay and so the consistent behavior of nature is very very important it&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>enables us to be what we are and if you&rsquo;re calling upon God in in in in your critique</p>
<p>of why isn&rsquo;t this benevolent creator you know fixing things one answer is he&rsquo;s fixed things</p>
<p>in a certain sense to have an integrity in them and that integrity is the best thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the way we have our existence it&rsquo;s the way we live and move and have our being and</p>
<p>you know if you want something different you&rsquo;ve got to show that there is a way in which you</p>
<p>could invent a world that is better that it has the integrity that we need to exist okay</p>
<p>and and and to be able to think and and and love and and be but but you were going to</p>
<p>do it better you know and the atheists think that maybe they have got a better idea but</p>
<p>if they thought about it a bit more carefully they&rsquo;d realize no one has put forward a better</p>
<p>idea okay so the so another way to say that uh i mean is that suffering is an integral</p>
<p>part of this of um of a consistent existence so so sort of uh and the philosophical in</p>
<p>a philosophical sense uh the full richness and the beauty of our experience would not</p>
<p>be as beautiful would not be as rich uh if there was no suffering in the world is that</p>
<p>is that possible well i think you said two different things that aren&rsquo;t exactly at least</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t exactly the same one is that suffering is an integral part of our experience you</p>
<p>know that might be considered a challenge to certain types of christian theology or</p>
<p>or even uh jewish theology in other words um christians talk about the fall and talk</p>
<p>about uh adam and eve in the garden and and have have a vision of there being some kind</p>
<p>of perception from or perfection from which we have fallen and i think there is a perfection</p>
<p>from which we&rsquo;ve fallen but i don&rsquo;t think that perfection is some kind of physical perfection</p>
<p>in other words i don&rsquo;t subscribe personally to the view that some some christians do that</p>
<p>there was some state um prior to the fall in which death did not occur i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s consistent with science as we know it and i and i think that um death for</p>
<p>example has been part of the biological world and the and the universe as a whole um from</p>
<p>from billions of years ago so so just to be clear about that um you know i on the other</p>
<p>hand i do so if that&rsquo;s the case then certainly in that sense at the very least um suffering</p>
<p>or at least death okay is part of the biological existence and that probably seems so completely</p>
<p>obvious to somebody who you know is au fait with science whether they you know whether</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a scientist or not well so and i apologize if i&rsquo;m interrupting but it&rsquo;s the obvious reality</p>
<p>of of uh our life today but there&rsquo;s a lot of people i think it&rsquo;s currently in vogue</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve talked to quite a few folks who kind of see as the goal of many of our pursuits</p>
<p>as to extend life indefinitely a sort of uh you know a dream for many people is to live</p>
<p>forever uh but in the in the technological world in the engineering world in the scientific</p>
<p>world i mean that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the big dream to me it feels like that&rsquo;s not a dream it&rsquo;s i</p>
<p>certainly would like to live forever uh like that that&rsquo;s the initial feeling the instinctual</p>
<p>feeling because you know life is so amazing but then if you actually kind of like you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>presented it if you actually uh live that kind of life you would realize that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually a step uh backwards that&rsquo;s a step down from the experience of this life in my</p>
<p>sense that death is an essential part of life uh about an essential part of this experience</p>
<p>death of all things so the thing the fact that things end somehow and the scarcity of</p>
<p>things somehow create the beauty of this experience that we have yeah transhumanism doesn&rsquo;t look</p>
<p>very attractive to me either but it also doesn&rsquo;t look very feasible um but that&rsquo;s a whole big</p>
<p>topic that i&rsquo;m not exactly an expert but i&rsquo;ll say but i but you know i&rsquo;m of a certain age</p>
<p>where my mortality is more pressing or more obvious to me than it once was okay um and</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t dread that i don&rsquo;t see that as in a certain sense even the enemy okay you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not afraid of death well i&rsquo;m afraid of lots of things in a in a in a conceptual way but</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t keep me awake at night okay um i i&rsquo;m i think like most people i&rsquo;m more afraid</p>
<p>of pain than i am of death so i i don&rsquo;t want to put myself forward as some kind of hero</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t worry about these things that&rsquo;s not true but i i do think and maybe this is</p>
<p>part of my christian outlook um that there is life beyond the grave um but i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that that it&rsquo;s life in this universe or in this um certainly not in this body and maybe</p>
<p>not in a certain sense in this mind i mean you know christian christian belief in the</p>
<p>afterlife is is that we will be resurrected we will be in a certain sense be with god</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what that means and i don&rsquo;t think anybody else really quite knows what that</p>
<p>means but there are lots of ways that over history people artists and and and writers</p>
<p>and so forth have pictured it um and these are all perhaps some of them helpful ways</p>
<p>of thinking about it do you think it&rsquo;s possible to know what happens after we die um i i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think we find out by near death experiences or those kinds of things but but i but i think</p>
<p>that uh you know that we have sufficient i feel i have sufficient information if you</p>
<p>like um in terms of god&rsquo;s revelation to be confident that that i will go somewhere</p>
<p>else okay but it won&rsquo;t be here and i to me the aspirations of transhumanism are horrific</p>
<p>i mean i think it would be a nightmare not a dream a nightmare you know to be somehow</p>
<p>downloaded into a computer and live one&rsquo;s life like that i because it it completely</p>
<p>discounts the integrity of our bodies as well as our minds i mean we aren&rsquo;t just disembodied</p>
<p>minds it would not be me that was in the computer it would be something else if if that kind</p>
<p>of download were possible of course it isn&rsquo;t possible and it&rsquo;s very long way from being</p>
<p>possible but you know amazing things happen so we shouldn&rsquo;t be too certain so this is</p>
<p>this is a place that uh again maybe taking a slight step outside uh wherever philosophizing</p>
<p>a little bit uh let me ask you about uh human level or superhuman level intelligence uh</p>
<p>the artificial intelligence systems do you what do you make from um from almost a religious</p>
<p>or a perspective that we&rsquo;ve been talking about of the special aspect of human nature of us</p>
<p>creating intelligence systems that exhibit some elements of that human nature is that</p>
<p>something again like we were talking about with transhumanism uh there&rsquo;s a feasibility</p>
<p>question of how hard is it to actually build machines that human level intelligence or</p>
<p>have something like consciousness or have all those kinds of human qualities and then</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the do we want to do that kind of thing so on both of those directions what</p>
<p>do you think well okay so you know since your podcast is called ai i don&rsquo;t want to offend</p>
<p>too many of your listeners out there that&rsquo;s but i but i i think one should be a little</p>
<p>bit more modest about one&rsquo;s claims for ai than have typically been the case yeah i think</p>
<p>that actually a lot of people in ai are somewhat chastened and so there there are more modest</p>
<p>claims than are common with the transhumanists and yes and and so forth um and you know i</p>
<p>used to play chess when i was a kid i was pretty good at it okay um won competitions</p>
<p>and so on and so forth and i when i and i&rsquo;m talking about when i was in high school i</p>
<p>thought it was pretty unlikely that a computer would be able to become good at chess but</p>
<p>i was dead wrong okay and so you know um how did that make you feel by the way when um</p>
<p>t blue big i stopped playing chess seriously when i had when i encountered computers that</p>
<p>could beat me okay i still play with my grandchildren a little bit but but um but yeah it it seemed</p>
<p>like in a certain sense it became a solved problem uh when ai was able to do it better</p>
<p>than i could so i think that there are ways in which today we&rsquo;ve seen um computers do</p>
<p>things which historically were regarded as being very characteristic of human intelligence</p>
<p>and in that sense there there is some success to ai i also think that um you know there</p>
<p>are certain things which one might think of as being ai which are you know completely</p>
<p>widespread in our society i&rsquo;m thinking about the internet search engines and so forth which</p>
<p>are enormously influential and obviously do things more powerfully than any individual</p>
<p>human or even any combination of humans could do much faster and and and accessing databases</p>
<p>and so on and so forth is all of this is outstripped our human intelligence um i&rsquo;m not sure the</p>
<p>extent though to which that is really intelligence uh in the way that was traditionally meant</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s certainly amazingly um facile and um it it multiplies our ability to access</p>
<p>human knowledge and and data and so forth so is that something is that is that enter</p>
<p>the realm of something we should be concerned about so in the realm of religion you talk</p>
<p>about what is good what is evil what is right what is wrong you have set of morals set of</p>
<p>beliefs and when you have an entity come into the picture that uh that has quite a bit of</p>
<p>power if we potentially look into the future and intelligence and capability um do you</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s something that religion can say about artificial intelligence or is that</p>
<p>something you we shouldn&rsquo;t worry about until that arrives you think just like with the</p>
<p>chess program um you know religious writers have thought about this for centuries uh you</p>
<p>know there&rsquo;s been a long debate about what is what was historically called the plurality</p>
<p>of worlds and it was actually more about whether there are places where other intelligent creatures</p>
<p>live than it was about us creating them but but i think it&rsquo;s largely the same question</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like aliens like other intelligent so if there is other intelligent life in the</p>
<p>universe what is its relationship to god okay that is in a certain sense the puzzle that</p>
<p>religious thinkers and writers have thought about for a long time and there&rsquo;s a whole</p>
<p>range of of different opinions about that i mean personally you know i think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an interesting question but it&rsquo;s not a very pressing question at the moment um yeah and</p>
<p>i think the same way about the the question of what happens if we&rsquo;re able to build a sentient</p>
<p>robot for example um i think it&rsquo;s an interesting question and we&rsquo;ll have to think about it</p>
<p>when that happens um but i think we&rsquo;re still quite a ways away from that and so i i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a good answer um but i think there&rsquo;s a literature that you one could tap um to</p>
<p>think about if you want to start early on the question well let me ask you another impossible</p>
<p>question from a religious or from a personal perspective what do you think is consciousness</p>
<p>this this uh subjective experience that we seem to be having there&rsquo;s uh this there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>uh the christian religion have something to say about consciousness does your own when</p>
<p>you look in the mirror do you have a sense of what is consciousness um i think the bible</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have much in the way of answers about that directly in the sense that you&rsquo;re perhaps</p>
<p>asking it which is more like i think you&rsquo;re asking for some kind of uh quasi scientific</p>
<p>or maybe indeed scientific uh description that&rsquo;s really looking for one yes um i i think</p>
<p>that i think that there it&rsquo;s an interesting question i think it&rsquo;s actually um it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>jump too far i think we have we don&rsquo;t even know the answer to the question what is the</p>
<p>mind let alone consciousness so if you distinguish between those two things i think the question</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being addressed more directly um scientifically as well as in other ways it is what is the</p>
<p>mind um and that is certainly a very topical question even in places like mit which is</p>
<p>not historically involved with philosophical questions you know that people are doing neuroscience</p>
<p>and so forth i think it&rsquo;s a very important question and i think that we&rsquo;re going to find</p>
<p>that um we are not computers in other words i think uh the the commonplace theory of what</p>
<p>mind is is is generally speaking by analogy that we are basically wet wetware okay um</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re some computer like um entity um and that that the analogy to digital computers</p>
<p>is is is a pretty decent one i mean that that&rsquo;s of course a viewpoint which um you know which</p>
<p>drives the aspirations of the transhumanists i mean they they so much believe that our</p>
<p>minds are nothing other than you know in a certain sense some kind of implementation</p>
<p>of software in biology that they say to themselves well of course we&rsquo;re going to be able to download</p>
<p>it into a into a digital computer i don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true i think it&rsquo;s most likely</p>
<p>that quantum mechanics is very important in the brain uh it seems most unlikely that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not to me i know that that&rsquo;s contrary to the opinions of many people but but that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>view and it&rsquo;s also a view for example of people like roger penrose and and people like that</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve written about it um rather extensively and if that&rsquo;s the case then really my mind</p>
<p>is not reproduce reducible to some kind of software which can be considered to be portable</p>
<p>it is so uh connected to the hardware of my body that the two are inseparable okay and</p>
<p>so if that is in fact what we find um as i suspect will be the case then the aspirations</p>
<p>of the transhumanists will be very long incoming if at all um so i think that actually physics</p>
<p>and chemistry um you know are in a are in a sense um involved with the brain and with</p>
<p>in the mind but not in a very simple way like you know like the computer analogy um in and</p>
<p>a much more complicated way and i and i also think that um it&rsquo;s philosophically ignorant</p>
<p>to speak as if um when and if the actions of the brain are understood at the physical</p>
<p>and chemical level that will mean that the mind will vanish as a concept you know that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll just say no we&rsquo;re nothing but brains okay of course it won&rsquo;t i mean it may well</p>
<p>be that our mind is an emergent phenomenon that comes out of the physics and chemistry</p>
<p>and biology okay but it&rsquo;s also something that we have to encounter and take seriously and</p>
<p>so um you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not the case that it that the mind is reducible to nothing but</p>
<p>physics and chemistry even if it&rsquo;s embedded in you know continuously into physics and</p>
<p>chemistry as i rather suspect it is um so i that that&rsquo;s my own view i mean another way</p>
<p>of putting it is that the mind or the soul is not something added into humans as might</p>
<p>have been the viewpoint um historically i do think there is you know there is something</p>
<p>added to humans but it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not the mind it&rsquo;s the spirit and that takes us beyond</p>
<p>the physical it takes us beyond this universe but i but i don&rsquo;t think that that consciousness</p>
<p>the mind etc etc is that thing which is necessarily added in so i i&rsquo;m not be emergent in some</p>
<p>way i&rsquo;m not a substance dualist in that sense okay if you want to put it philosophically</p>
<p>i mean uh but you see your sense is um so the mind and the intelligence and consciousness</p>
<p>can be these emergent things do you do you have a hope a sense that science could help</p>
<p>us get it pretty far down the road of understanding we will get much further than we have and</p>
<p>we it&rsquo;ll be interesting um i mean right now our our methods of diagnosing the human brain</p>
<p>are extremely primitive i mean the resolution that we have you know that comes out of uh</p>
<p>out of nmr and and brain scans and so forth is miserable compared with what we need in</p>
<p>order to understand the brain at the cellular level let alone at the atomic level um but</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;re making progress it&rsquo;s relatively slow progress but it&rsquo;s progress and people</p>
<p>are working on it and we&rsquo;re going to get better at it and we&rsquo;ll find out very interesting</p>
<p>things as we do um the time resolution is also completely hopeless compared compare</p>
<p>with what we need to understand of a thought you know so um so there&rsquo;s a long way to go</p>
<p>and we will get better at it um but i&rsquo;m but i&rsquo;m not at all worried as some people are</p>
<p>and some people speak as if this is a good thing that somehow the concepts of humanity</p>
<p>and the mind and religion and and consciousness are going to vanish because we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have you know complete uh physicochemical description of the brain in the near future</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not going to have that and secondly even if we had it the mind and all these other</p>
<p>things aren&rsquo;t going to vanish because of it well i i find kind of compelling the the notion</p>
<p>that whoever created this universe uh and us uh did so to understand itself himself</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a powerful self reflection notion to this whole experiment</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re a part of i certainly think that god takes delight in his creation and that</p>
<p>it was created for that delight as much as it was um for any other reason and that you</p>
<p>know that therefore are there&rsquo;s reason to be hopeful and and awestruck by the creation</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s on the very small or on the very large i&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re familiar there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something called the simulation hypothesis well that&rsquo;s been fun to talk about with the</p>
<p>computer scientists and so on which is a kind of thought experiment that proposes that um</p>
<p>you know the entirety of the world around us is a kind of a computer program that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a simulation and then we&rsquo;re living inside it i think there&rsquo;s um i think from a certain</p>
<p>perspective that could be consistent with a religious view of the world i mean you could</p>
<p>just use different terms uh basically uh what are your but it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a it feels like a</p>
<p>more um modern updated version of that but what is what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s your sense of this uh</p>
<p>the simulation hypothesis do you find interesting useful to think about it do you find it ridiculous</p>
<p>did you find it fun what are your thoughts uh it&rsquo;s fun and it&rsquo;s been of course the subject</p>
<p>of various movies yeah um that that some of which are very well known um you know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it makes sense to think of it as a simulation hypothesis in the sense that we&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>lying in uh banks um of of uh on banks of of beds having our energy drained away from</p>
<p>us um and and the simulation is going on in our individual brains that that makes no sense</p>
<p>to me at all i don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s meant by the simulation hypothesis as you&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>it now but i think that there is a um there is very little distinction between saying</p>
<p>that a an intelligent creator has set up the universe according to his will and his plan</p>
<p>and set it in motion and is allowing it to run out maybe as christians say he&rsquo;s sustaining</p>
<p>it actually um by his word of power it says in the book of the letter to hebrews okay</p>
<p>um in in in in this amazingly consistent and um integrated way um i don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very much difference between saying that and saying that it&rsquo;s a simulation okay i mean</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s almost the same thing okay but i but i think from but i think it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to recognize that the simulation in that concept the simulation and the creation or the universe</p>
<p>are the same thing okay in other words it&rsquo;s a simulation you know that is billions of</p>
<p>light years across okay yeah um i mean there&rsquo;s a sense in which it helps one understand especially</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not religious that there is something outside of the world that uh we live in that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something bigger than the world we live in um and that i mean it&rsquo;s just another</p>
<p>perspective on uh that humbles humbles you um so in that sense one shortcoming of that</p>
<p>is is the following is of the of the analogy is this that we think of a simulation as something</p>
<p>take taking place in the universe you know when we it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s taking place in my computer</p>
<p>okay i don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the right analogy for um a christian view of creation okay i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s taking place in some other universe that god has made okay i i think</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s taking place in the mind of god christians might hypothesize also but i but</p>
<p>i think that that that it&rsquo;s important to recognize that christian theology at any rate</p>
<p>is that god is not one of the entities in the universe and and presumably therefore</p>
<p>is very different from a simulation that we might run on a computer let me ask you adam</p>
<p>and eve even adam ate of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil does this</p>
<p>is this story meaningful to you what does the story mean to you yeah i it is meaningful</p>
<p>to me um i i take the you know the writings of the bible very seriously and i think that</p>
<p>most christians regard them as having some kind of authoritative um role in their in</p>
<p>their in their faith um what do i get from it i mean i think the most important thing</p>
<p>that christians get from the story of adam and eve and they&rsquo;re eating the apple and</p>
<p>so forth is that the relationship between humans and god is broken has been broken by</p>
<p>man&rsquo;s disobedience that&rsquo;s what the the story of adam and eve and the apple is all about</p>
<p>and um that that broken relationship is for christians what jesus came to redeem came</p>
<p>to overcome that brokenness and uh restore uh that relationship with god um uh to some</p>
<p>extent at any rate on earth and and ultimately um you know in in the in eternity to restore</p>
<p>it fully so that&rsquo;s really what christians mean and gain from the story of adam and eve</p>
<p>of course lots of people ask the questions about how sort how literally should we take</p>
<p>these stories of particularly the first few few chapters of genesis which is an important</p>
<p>question but but i mean but we tend to um get bogged down with it a bit too much i think</p>
<p>we should take away the message um and i think the the the uh what the what actually we would</p>
<p>have seen if we&rsquo;d been there okay is something which is a matter of speculation and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>certainly not terribly important from the point of view of christian theology but it</p>
<p>seems like a very important moment um as a man of faith do you um do you do you wish</p>
<p>that uh i think it was eve first uh yeah well see do you wish that by the way it was just</p>
<p>a fruit as a few what you said it very carefully as the fruit fruit of the tree right uh do</p>
<p>you wish they wouldn&rsquo;t have eaten of the tree i mean this is a back to our discussion of</p>
<p>suffering was that like an essential thing that needed to happen you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>read paradise lost to get your answer to that beautifully put okay well let me ask the the</p>
<p>biggest question one that you also touch in your book but one that i asked every once</p>
<p>in a while is what is the meaning of life the meaning of my life is many different things</p>
<p>okay but it but they are all kind of centered around um relationships um i mean for a christian</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s relationship with god is a crucial part of the meaning of life but one&rsquo;s relationship</p>
<p>with one&rsquo;s family wife&rsquo;s wife parents children grandchildren in my case um and so forth those</p>
<p>are crucially important um these are all the places where people whether they&rsquo;re religious</p>
<p>or not find meaning um but ultimately um i think a person who has faith in a creator</p>
<p>um who we think has a an intention or many intentions but a but a but a will um in respect</p>
<p>of the world as a whole that&rsquo;s a crucial part of meaning and the idea that my life might</p>
<p>have some small significance in the plan of that creator is an amazingly powerful idea</p>
<p>that give that brings meaning um i i tell a story in my book that um when i was a student</p>
<p>before i became a christian i read a philosophy book with whose approximate title was um what</p>
<p>you know what is the meaning of life and you know that book basically said there is no</p>
<p>meaning to life you have to make up the meaning as you go along and i think that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>the the predominant secular view is these days that there is no real meaning but you</p>
<p>can make up a meaning and that will give you meaning into your life um i don&rsquo;t subscribe</p>
<p>to that view anymore um i think there is more meaning than that um but i do think that those</p>
<p>things which give meaning to our life are very important and we should emphasize them</p>
<p>and you you have said that as the part of the as the part of that meaning is the part</p>
<p>of your faith uh love and loyalty are key parts so can you try to say what is uh love</p>
<p>and loyalty like what what does it mean to you what does it look like if you were to</p>
<p>give advice to uh to your children grandchildren of what to look for in in looking for loyalty</p>
<p>and and and love what would you try to say well i think it&rsquo;s something like yielding</p>
<p>your will or desire to another um it&rsquo;s valuing others more highly or at least as highly as</p>
<p>yourself but that&rsquo;s just the start of it because true love you reach a point where you are</p>
<p>you feel compelled by the other uh and that i think to some people sounds very scary but</p>
<p>actually it&rsquo;s terrifically liberating um and i think that love then brings you into service</p>
<p>towards another and i&rsquo;m you know reminded of um the phrase from the anglican uh prayer</p>
<p>book where it talks about um jesus whose service is perfect freedom in other words for us christians</p>
<p>to serve god is what perfects our freedom and i think there is an amazing love is um</p>
<p>is in part kept captivity but in a kind of paradoxical sense it&rsquo;s also an amazing freedom</p>
<p>love is freedom i don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end it we started with fusion energy</p>
<p>and ending on love in there&rsquo;s a huge honor to talk to you thank you so much for your</p>

<p>christian hindu jewish and muslim friends that i am sincerely happy that the religion</p>
