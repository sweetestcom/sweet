this probably</p><p>is the most important webinar that I&rsquo;ve</p><p>ever done on weight loss you&rsquo;re going to</p><p>learn some seriously powerful tools that</p><p>are going to just crack through any</p><p>break through any plateauing you have</p><p>okay now I have a series of slides that</p><p>I want to present to you so I&rsquo;m going to</p><p>open those up right now all right cool</p><p>see if I could do this here not try to</p><p>make it bigger there we go let&rsquo;s try</p><p>this one okay does that work I think</p><p>that worked cool alright so welcome how</p><p>to bust through any weight loss plateau</p><p>and get your body amazing okay so let&rsquo;s</p><p>let&rsquo;s go through some things here now I</p><p>know you&rsquo;ve heard you know all you have</p><p>to do is eat less and move more and you</p><p>just going to lose weight this is this</p><p>is a concept that all experts do agree</p><p>but the theory has been thoroughly</p><p>disproven it&rsquo;s complete utter failure it</p><p>just doesn&rsquo;t work you know it&rsquo;s based on</p><p>this concept that one pound of fat</p><p>equals 3500 calories and if you just eat</p><p>500 calories less each day you lose one</p><p>pound a week well there&rsquo;s more to this</p><p>you know calories in versus equals</p><p>calories out so we&rsquo;re going to get into</p><p>the truth behind this thing this is it&rsquo;s</p><p>just a failure now we do know that low</p><p>carb diets do work for lots of people</p><p>but why don&rsquo;t they work for everyone</p><p>that&rsquo;s my question so we&rsquo;re going to</p><p>cover some things that go way beyond</p><p>just the low carb okay</p><p>but the main thing I want to do today is</p><p>help you bust through your Plateau</p><p>okay I&rsquo;m gonna give you a lot of stuff</p><p>just follow through the notes the</p><p>Downloads you should have them by now</p><p>and just fill it out as we go okay so so</p><p>a plateau what is a plateau it&rsquo;s</p><p>basically a weight right your body is</p><p>very comfortable and it doesn&rsquo;t like to</p><p>move it wants to stay right there okay</p><p>unfortunately the three facts are this</p><p>dieting slows your metabolism the more</p><p>you diet the slower your metabolism so</p><p>if I meet someone for the first time in</p><p>my office and they say well I&rsquo;ve never</p><p>been in a diet before those people are a</p><p>lot easier to work with than people that</p><p>have diet dieted their whole life but</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to show you some things that</p><p>we can reverse this whole set point okay</p><p>also one little tiny little note here</p><p>age slows your metabolism sure you</p><p>already figure that out but</p><p>unfortunately as we age things slow down</p><p>so we have the combination of many many</p><p>diets and a an aging which is even a</p><p>compounded effect on your metabolism</p><p>unfortunately but there&rsquo;s two main</p><p>problems number one we have the problem</p><p>you know decrease calories in you know</p><p>every time you cut your calories every</p><p>time you diet your body adapts so it</p><p>just slows your metabolism down so let&rsquo;s</p><p>say you want to get to 140 and you&rsquo;re</p><p>170 and you lose weight and all of a</p><p>sudden you stop losing weight if you</p><p>continue to try to lose weight past 140</p><p>your body will either get extremely</p><p>hungry and craving or it just will slow</p><p>your metabolism down even more it just</p><p>won&rsquo;t let you get past that point now</p><p>the second problem is that your body has</p><p>not been burning fat as fuel it&rsquo;s been</p><p>burning sugar is fuel these are the two</p><p>fuel sources and if you&rsquo;re not losing</p><p>weight and you&rsquo;re stuck then we</p><p>you&rsquo;re not burning fat okay so we need</p><p>to you know switch things over so now I</p><p>would just have a question and you could</p><p>if you could answer this this would be</p><p>great if you can or if you&rsquo;re watching</p><p>this what you can&rsquo;t that&rsquo;s fine but I</p><p>want to know do you know what hormone</p><p>effects the switch which determines</p><p>whether you&rsquo;re going to burn fat fuel or</p><p>what are you going to burn sugar field</p><p>do you know that fats which if you do</p><p>just go ahead and type it in there okay</p><p>now before I get into what the switches</p><p>I just want to quickly introduce myself</p><p>for those people who don&rsquo;t know me a lot</p><p>of you guys know me some of you don&rsquo;t</p><p>been in practice for 26 years I work at</p><p>my Northern Virginia clinic on over</p><p>45,000 people I taught at Howard</p><p>University as their associate professor</p><p>in the nutrition department best-selling</p><p>offer seven principles of fat burning</p><p>I trained over doctors and alternative</p><p>medicine so I certify them in my methods</p><p>I delivered over 4,900 seminars to all</p><p>the governmental agencies in DC and I&rsquo;ve</p><p>done some of those to churches all over</p><p>the place I have over a thousand YouTube</p><p>videos with over 13 million views and</p><p>muscle the developer of the four body</p><p>types and real quickly my story in a</p><p>thumbnail sketches I lived on junk food</p><p>and sugar I&rsquo;ve never eaten any</p><p>vegetables until I think I was 22 years</p><p>old I just didn&rsquo;t like them so I would</p><p>consume massive nuts my grandmother was</p><p>an incredible</p><p>cook she made these huge cakes for me</p><p>all the time and I would eat the whole</p><p>thing by myself so I just kept going and</p><p>I pretty much I started getting blood</p><p>sugar problems when I was 13 I noticed I</p><p>didn&rsquo;t know what it was at the time it</p><p>was very dizzy and then I got into</p><p>sports I got into wrestling</p><p>I went to state and wrestling wrestling</p><p>college but honestly my nutrition was so</p><p>bad so I would go</p><p>into the the the season undefeated and</p><p>then I start getting weaker and weaker</p><p>and weaker and weaker and weaker I knew</p><p>nothing about health and if I could only</p><p>go back in time so I got really bad to</p><p>the point where I pushed myself to the</p><p>point where my bones became actual</p><p>actually fragile and I fractured</p><p>fracturing bones fractured my neck</p><p>fractured my leg my shoulder then I</p><p>decided to go in the military so I went</p><p>into basic training and during basic</p><p>training it&rsquo;s very stressful and you</p><p>also you&rsquo;re eating his neck right you</p><p>don&rsquo;t sleep so I barely passed the PT</p><p>test when I got out of basic training</p><p>Fort Jackson South Carolina and to 1983</p><p>so that was really kind of rough on my</p><p>body too so I just kind of went through</p><p>a series of stressful events and then</p><p>when I started getting to be about 28</p><p>years old I started really starting</p><p>breaking down arthritis insomnia chronic</p><p>fatigue blood sugar issues going right</p><p>in the diabetes um</p><p>constipation oh my gosh I was a basket</p><p>case</p><p>I was always tired okay but all of that</p><p>forced me to be interested in helping</p><p>myself with nutrition and fortunately to</p><p>push push beyond points of knowledge</p><p>that other practitioners might not go to</p><p>because I personally was desperate to</p><p>figure this thing out so I really</p><p>respected tremendous amounts of data to</p><p>try to come up with solutions and to</p><p>make a long story short I figured out</p><p>what was wrong with me I started to get</p><p>better and I&rsquo;m 51 right now I&rsquo;m way</p><p>healthier than I&rsquo;m now that I&rsquo;m back</p><p>when I was 28 and so yeah your body can</p><p>we can bounce back so that&rsquo;s my story in</p><p>a thumbnail sketch now let&rsquo;s get into</p><p>this switch okay now before I just show</p><p>you something</p><p>okay this book right here guidance</p><p>physiology this is the Bible of</p><p>physiology this book I studied in</p><p>pre-med and it has incredible data on</p><p>how the body works so it&rsquo;s not</p><p>necessarily some study it&rsquo;s like actual</p><p>facts and I want to share with you on</p><p>page 9:30 some amazing information you</p><p>can see this is in college these are</p><p>coffee stains okay so I&rsquo;m going to share</p><p>with you something that actually will</p><p>blow your way okay so let me just pull</p><p>up the page and I made a little clip of</p><p>it so you can see it okay so let me just</p><p>have to go through these there we go</p><p>okay</p><p>boom okay now you can see check this out</p><p>role of insulin and switching between</p><p>carbohydrate and lipid metabolism Wow</p><p>this is down here when glucose</p><p>concentration is low insulin secretion</p><p>is suppressed and fat is utilized almost</p><p>exclusively for energy now what does all</p><p>that mean it means that insulin that</p><p>hormone that lowers blood sugar is the</p><p>switch between sugar and fat and when</p><p>your sugar concentrations low your</p><p>insulin is low and your fat is utilized</p><p>almost exclusively for energy so in</p><p>other words your fat is only going to be</p><p>utilized when we keep the glucose low</p><p>okay that&rsquo;s part of the answer but this</p><p>is the switch so insulin is the switch</p><p>okay so insulin is a switch and now what</p><p>is in some insulin is a hormone that</p><p>lowers blood sugar okay what happens</p><p>when you eat too much sugar or eat sugar</p><p>insulin secreted and it takes the sugar</p><p>out of the blood because your body</p><p>considers sugar</p><p>as a toxin okay so now your set point</p><p>which is that weight that your body</p><p>loves to be at exclusively is controlled</p><p>100% by insulin okay here&rsquo;s a picture</p><p>the pancreas secretes insulin it gets</p><p>the sugar out right very simple so how</p><p>does it do this it increases the</p><p>absorption of glucose into the cells the</p><p>muscle and the liver so it makes your</p><p>body sponge like to pull in the glucose</p><p>okay and it converts sugar into stored</p><p>sugar called glycogen in the liver and</p><p>the muscles and it also converts sugar</p><p>into fat and cholesterol fat cholesterol</p><p>and triglycerides number three it</p><p>prevents any fat from being born</p><p>I&rsquo;m served so basically insulin controls</p><p>whether you&rsquo;re storing fat or you&rsquo;re</p><p>burning fat when there&rsquo;s no insulin</p><p>there you&rsquo;re burning fat when there&rsquo;s no</p><p>insulin there you&rsquo;re not absorbing</p><p>glucose into the cells liver muscles</p><p>okay so that&rsquo;s how it works</p><p>okay so now if you look at the actual</p><p>burning of fat the actual burning of fat</p><p>is controlled by an enzyme it&rsquo;s</p><p>controlled by the enzyme and the name of</p><p>that enzyme is called hormone sensitive</p><p>lipase okay just the primary enzyme that</p><p>burns fat and guess what insulin in</p><p>activates it and it turns it on when</p><p>insulin is very low so in other words</p><p>when we get the insulin out of your</p><p>system clean it out</p><p>this enzyme will start working too how</p><p>people in fact okay that&rsquo;s how it works</p><p>so this is straight out of guidance</p><p>physiology I&rsquo;m going to give you a</p><p>little quote check this out all aspects</p><p>of fat metabolism are greatly enhanced</p><p>in the absence of insulin Wow</p><p>interesting</p><p>and the down here the most important</p><p>effect is that the enzyme hormone</p><p>sensitive lipase okay in the fat cells</p><p>become strongly activated Wow</p><p>it&rsquo;s right there so again I&rsquo;m just kind</p><p>of making a point that insulin is in</p><p>charge with this thing okay now here&rsquo;s</p><p>the problem</p><p>most people with stubborn belly fat or</p><p>stubborn weight or a stubborn setpoint</p><p>have a insulin problem okay and it&rsquo;s</p><p>called insulin resistance okay let me</p><p>explain what that is the receptors for</p><p>insulin in the cells and the muscle</p><p>deliver become blocked so if here&rsquo;s a</p><p>good analogy if you&rsquo;re let&rsquo;s say your</p><p>your house was underneath a train or a</p><p>metro and you heard these trains going</p><p>over your your house every single day at</p><p>first it&rsquo;s going to drive it crazy but</p><p>after a while you&rsquo;ll start to become</p><p>immune to it you won&rsquo;t even hear it so</p><p>the same thing with this when you have</p><p>high levels of insulin being pumped on</p><p>that pancreas over a long period of time</p><p>your body will start to reject it as a</p><p>poison and start blocking it and that&rsquo;s</p><p>what happens okay so insulin resistance</p><p>is created from high levels of insulin</p><p>being pumped out over and over over a</p><p>period of time so you have a situation</p><p>where you have high insulin and you have</p><p>low insulin in other places so you can</p><p>have symptoms of hyperglycemia which is</p><p>high sugar or diabetes and low sugar</p><p>which is hypoglycemic so it&rsquo;s really</p><p>really weird so what happens is when the</p><p>cell or the liver becomes low with</p><p>insulin there&rsquo;s a feedback loop that&rsquo;s</p><p>going to tell the pancreas to make more</p><p>insulin so even when you&rsquo;re not eating</p><p>sugar your insulin is going to be high</p><p>if you have insulin resistance okay</p><p>here&rsquo;s if you&rsquo;re curious if you have</p><p>insulin resistance okay maybe you have a</p><p>stubborn weight but maybe maybe you</p><p>don&rsquo;t have all these other issue that if</p><p>you do so here so that this is the cell</p><p>of insulin resistance okay belly fat a</p><p>fatty liver and by the way if you have</p><p>belly fat you have some fat on your</p><p>liver okay they go hand-in-hand brain</p><p>fog your belly bloats and swells either</p><p>after meal or at night not in the</p><p>morning sleepy after meals okay you need</p><p>a nap I&rsquo;ll show you why in a minute okay</p><p>not satisfied after meals why because</p><p>you can&rsquo;t pull in the nutrients</p><p>everything is stuck there it&rsquo;s blocked</p><p>high blood pressure cravings for carbs</p><p>and sweets inflammation cannot go</p><p>without eating from one meal to the next</p><p>excessive hunger having a snack at night</p><p>and even bladder problems you having to</p><p>go up and urinate in the middle of night</p><p>isn&rsquo;t a symptom of insulin resistance</p><p>now here&rsquo;s some other symptoms check</p><p>this out</p><p>polycystic ovarian syndrome if you&rsquo;ve</p><p>never heard about that that&rsquo;s usually</p><p>when a woman gets acne in facial hair</p><p>infertility that comes from insulin</p><p>resistance now if you look that up a lot</p><p>of times you&rsquo;ll say oh one of the</p><p>symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome</p><p>is insulin resistance unlike no insulin</p><p>resistance causes polycystic ovarian</p><p>syndrome resistance increases androgens</p><p>okay alright so you can also have</p><p>estrogen dominance so insulin resistance</p><p>can spike estrogen unfortunately</p><p>estrogen can then increase insulin as</p><p>well and that&rsquo;s why when women take</p><p>birth control pills they gain weight</p><p>when they have their cycle then gain</p><p>weight when they get pregnant they gain</p><p>weight which then blocks the thyroid oh</p><p>my gosh so it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a real terrible</p><p>cycle here okay so on the Left we have a</p><p>normal cell to the right we have insulin</p><p>resistance now remember insulin</p><p>resistance blocks this receptors right</p><p>so look at this the cell on the right is</p><p>literally starving of energy okay yet</p><p>you have all this energy stuck in the</p><p>blood so it&rsquo;s people with insulin</p><p>insulin resistance are kind of tired</p><p>they&rsquo;re weak you don&rsquo;t have the strength</p><p>they used to they</p><p>don&rsquo;t store sugar in between meals like</p><p>they used to and they&rsquo;re always craving</p><p>for sugar but they&rsquo;re never satisfied</p><p>that is what&rsquo;s happening to the at the</p><p>cellular level they&rsquo;re going right in</p><p>the diabetes okay so people with insulin</p><p>resistance have a higher fasting insulin</p><p>level so that means like at night when</p><p>they&rsquo;re sleeping their insulin is high</p><p>even if they&rsquo;re not eating any sugar</p><p>isn&rsquo;t that crazy</p><p>okay now I&rsquo;m sure you have heard of the</p><p>glycemic index right basically that&rsquo;s</p><p>the foods that break down the sugar</p><p>faster and they can spike your insulin</p><p>okay</p><p>so like a jelly bean is a lot higher</p><p>than um celery okay so that&rsquo;s the</p><p>glycemic index and so when you eat foods</p><p>high in sugar it spikes the insulin do</p><p>we choose things low in sugar it doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>stimulate as much but the glycemic index</p><p>is just not enough it turns out that</p><p>many people still fail at losing even</p><p>when they avoid foods high on the</p><p>glycemic index why is this because</p><p>glucose or sugar is only one of the</p><p>factors that triggers insulin in fact</p><p>glucose accounts for only 50% of the</p><p>insulin okay so let me just show you</p><p>this right here</p><p>let me just I have to leave this up here</p><p>okay so again what we&rsquo;re going to do is</p><p>we&rsquo;re going to take out my favorite book</p><p>gagging okay and right here I&rsquo;m going to</p><p>show you this right here other factors</p><p>that stimulate insulin right there see</p><p>the other factors amino certain amino</p><p>acids Wow does that mean amino acids</p><p>that&rsquo;s protein let&rsquo;s take a look all</p><p>right there is there is something called</p><p>the insolent index an insulin index okay</p><p>it&rsquo;s way more important than the</p><p>glycemic index because it covers a lot</p><p>of other things that you know that we</p><p>need to be looking at okay and one thing</p><p>is amino acids unfortunately certain</p><p>amino acids will trigger insulin okay</p><p>now here&rsquo;s the insulin index of certain</p><p>foods you can see down here beef fish</p><p>okay but eggs are pretty low and I tell</p><p>you why in a minute</p><p>okay protein can increase insulin but</p><p>not necessarily increase glucose that&rsquo;s</p><p>fascinating if you combine carbs or</p><p>sugar with protein you can increase the</p><p>insulin by 200 percent MSG triggers</p><p>insulin by 300 percent if you add</p><p>carbohydrate to fat you can also</p><p>increase insulin but guess what the</p><p>glucose goes down which is fascinating</p><p>okay so this is all really good things</p><p>but there&rsquo;s other factors that</p><p>potentiate or increase glucose and</p><p>insulin one is fructose now fructose is</p><p>in all the high fructose</p><p>corn syrups I mean the amount of the</p><p>problem right now is that almost all of</p><p>the sugar in units sold the United</p><p>States is subsidized by the government</p><p>so you can see the companies that sell</p><p>it are making huge profits and they</p><p>almost get it free because the</p><p>government pays it so you end up paying</p><p>the farmers to produce this GMO sugar</p><p>and yes it&rsquo;s GML a beet sugar is mostly</p><p>all GMO they passed this regulation that</p><p>now all the beet sugar has to be GML</p><p>unfortunately so now we have the corn</p><p>the GMO corn sugar which acts like a</p><p>pesticide and then we got the beet sugar</p><p>you see the problem oh my gosh okay so</p><p>here&rsquo;s the other thing I&rsquo;m going to</p><p>teach you whey protein whey protein</p><p>stimulates insulin a pretty-pretty</p><p>majorly</p><p>like on the insulin scale it&rsquo;s like 71</p><p>so egg white protein stimulates insulin</p><p>but egg yolks hardly at all so here&rsquo;s</p><p>the interesting point the point is this</p><p>let me just pull this up right here</p><p>so you know there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s great</p><p>articles out there on the insulin index</p><p>but you got to pay for them there rent</p><p>them I don&rsquo;t know why so I had to buy</p><p>this article and I actually read it and</p><p>I actually really read it and studied it</p><p>because I looked up probably maybe 9 to</p><p>10 or more words on every single page</p><p>and it looked them up to make sure that</p><p>it was comprehending and digesting and</p><p>it wasn&rsquo;t just reading the summary like</p><p>a lot of people do because I wanted to</p><p>really get this but I actually typed out</p><p>an insulin scale okay and what I want to</p><p>share with you is this fat does not</p><p>stimulate insulin hardly at all it&rsquo;s</p><p>very low butter being very low olive oil</p><p>being very low olives low coconut oil is</p><p>low heavy cream is low okay bacon is</p><p>really low why because bacon is mostly</p><p>fat okay so apparently the more</p><p>concentrated protein is the more</p><p>concentrated the protein powder is the</p><p>leaner than meets the low fat the meat</p><p>or the product the more that insulin</p><p>spikes Wow Wow</p><p>so these people that are going to the</p><p>store buying low fat protein low fat</p><p>carbs low fat fat all right now low fat</p><p>um actually just fat with with sugar oh</p><p>my gosh they are setting themselves up</p><p>for getting in some resistance okay now</p><p>I&rsquo;m just kind of increasing your</p><p>awareness because we&rsquo;re going to build</p><p>on this so we knew about the sugars now</p><p>there&rsquo;s certain proteins so if you take</p><p>the egg white and egg yolk and combine</p><p>them you can lower the insulin index</p><p>okay but nuts the nut that is delete the</p><p>lowest on the insulin index is pee cons</p><p>then you get macadamia nuts and the</p><p>avocados sour cream bacon peanut butter</p><p>so these are all really really low</p><p>but if you start going leader lean meats</p><p>low-fat goes higher higher and higher</p><p>and higher and higher</p><p>fascinating okay so that&rsquo;s one thing</p><p>okay so let me show you couple other</p><p>things</p><p>okay amino acids that&rsquo;s protein Peter</p><p>concentrated proteins whey protein</p><p>isolates like like the soy protein</p><p>isolates that are a lot of diet shakes</p><p>have high insulin triggering response</p><p>verses proteins with more fat so full</p><p>fat yogurt Greek yogurt is way better</p><p>than that free yogurt whey protein um is</p><p>not as good as whole milk cheese lean</p><p>meat is not as good as value me and I</p><p>kind of you can say have this reverse</p><p>but you can see the point there okay so</p><p>now when we add sugar to protein like in</p><p>barbecue breaded meat burger with bun</p><p>burgers with fries burgers with soda</p><p>burger with ketchup you&rsquo;re really just</p><p>spiking that in some way way up there</p><p>okay so I have a list here and you can</p><p>see pecans are really low butters really</p><p>level avocados Bacon&rsquo;s pretty low peanut</p><p>butters below egg yolks are pretty good</p><p>the whole egg but look at egg whites 55%</p><p>amazing Wow bananas way up there fat</p><p>free pretzels way up there holy bread oh</p><p>my goodness look at how high that is</p><p>white bread baked beans sweetened yogurt</p><p>potatoes jelly beans look at this these</p><p>are all the things that people think I</p><p>should be eating oh my goodness okay</p><p>alright so now I want to get into</p><p>something else if we&rsquo;re trying to get</p><p>rid of insulin resistance we&rsquo;re trying</p><p>to heal it we&rsquo;re trying to get your body</p><p>to recover from inside what caused it</p><p>the first place was sustained eating and</p><p>snacking because here&rsquo;s the here&rsquo;s the</p><p>other other thing that insulin</p><p>resistance can be I&rsquo;m sorry</p><p>here&rsquo;s something else that will trigger</p><p>insulin that you might not think just</p><p>basically general digestion</p><p>so there&rsquo;s hormones in your your stomach</p><p>that trigger insulin</p><p>okay so basically every time you eat</p><p>there&rsquo;s going to be some spike in</p><p>insulin that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to</p><p>communicate but very poorly of course so</p><p>if we look at this right here we got the</p><p>breakfast we got the spike of insulin we</p><p>got the snack</p><p>we got the lunch without the snack we&rsquo;ve</p><p>got the general got the snack and then</p><p>at night you if you graze you pretty</p><p>much will never ever get rid of insulin</p><p>resistance okay pre-diabetes you won&rsquo;t</p><p>get rid of it you&rsquo;re not getting rid of</p><p>your stomach so why because what we have</p><p>to do as a technique is we have to get</p><p>more recovery between the meals we have</p><p>to do a little bit of intermittent</p><p>fasting so the first thing I want you to</p><p>do is not snack between the meals okay</p><p>now if you have a hard time doing that</p><p>that just means that you have insulin</p><p>resistance we have to work on that</p><p>because you should be able to go from</p><p>one meal to the next without craving or</p><p>getting excessively hungry okay so this</p><p>would be the first step just do three</p><p>meals because look at you&rsquo;ll get a</p><p>little dip in insulin reduction between</p><p>breakfast and dinner and between lunch</p><p>and dinner and then after when you&rsquo;re</p><p>sleeping okay so that&rsquo;s a really good</p><p>thing but if you if you&rsquo;re not hungry in</p><p>the morning and you&rsquo;re only hungry let&rsquo;s</p><p>say at 12 then go for just eating two</p><p>meals a day and I&rsquo;m not trying to do</p><p>this to cut calories all I&rsquo;m trying to</p><p>do is to heal the insulin resistance</p><p>that is keeping your setpoint completely</p><p>fixated okay so we want time for your</p><p>body to recover and heal and if you&rsquo;re</p><p>constantly eating it&rsquo;s not going to work</p><p>okay so two meals is great if you can&rsquo;t</p><p>do that then do three okay but what I&rsquo;m</p><p>going to suggest is if you&rsquo;re having a</p><p>hard time going from one meal to the</p><p>next add a little fat to that meal and</p><p>it&rsquo;s not because that necessarily</p><p>dissolves fat or burns fat it&rsquo;s just</p><p>going to get get you to be able to</p><p>sustain your hunger a lot better and fat</p><p>does not trigger insulin so it&rsquo;s a safe</p><p>food and it does not cause any heart</p><p>problems and I don&rsquo;t want to get into a</p><p>too</p><p>right now but if you are concerned about</p><p>cholesterol and heart please watch my</p><p>videos and cholesterol because I</p><p>explained it thoroughly it&rsquo;s not the</p><p>cholesterol or fat that causes heart</p><p>attacks strokes or high cholesterol it&rsquo;s</p><p>the sugar okay that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s converted</p><p>all right now so you got that so we</p><p>talked about sugars proteins we talked</p><p>about snacking between meals all of that</p><p>messes you up but there&rsquo;s something else</p><p>that causes insulin resistance and that</p><p>is high cortisol levels okay high</p><p>cortisol levels now cortisol is a stress</p><p>hormone let me show you see if I could</p><p>find it right here okay this is another</p><p>book my favorite Sybil okay so in here</p><p>it talks about cortisol cortisol is a</p><p>stress hormone it&rsquo;s part of the adrenal</p><p>body type which just like right here so</p><p>check this out cortisol increases</p><p>glucose output okay so stress that</p><p>triggers cortisol increases glucose so</p><p>you don&rsquo;t end up Sara Lee have to be</p><p>eating anything or doing anything you go</p><p>through stress and your glucose goes up</p><p>okay when the glucose goes up the</p><p>insulin will go up so cortisol induces</p><p>diabetes Horsell induces insulin</p><p>resistance I have a very good friend</p><p>he had an injection of a prednisone shot</p><p>developed diabetes and he&rsquo;s just been</p><p>struggling ever since so here&rsquo;s the</p><p>here&rsquo;s the thing sometimes your friends</p><p>don&rsquo;t comply with my advice for us they</p><p>could they could overcome it because he</p><p>just can&rsquo;t give it up but the point is</p><p>this insulin lowers sugar</p><p>cortisol raises it</p><p>so when you see this belly fat right</p><p>here that is that causes so cortisol</p><p>causes this what it&rsquo;s doing it&rsquo;s causing</p><p>insulin so it&rsquo;s cortisol is indirectly</p><p>raising insulin that&rsquo;s making the belly</p><p>fat that belly fat all the fat in your</p><p>belly is controlled by insulin but</p><p>cortisol just one of the triggers okay</p><p>so that&rsquo;s an insulin belly and what</p><p>happens is that cortisol just happens to</p><p>be one of the triggers so on the scale</p><p>of insulin index that is a big one okay</p><p>so because I want to talk about cortisol</p><p>for just a little bit I wanna let me</p><p>just go ahead and switch it to the</p><p>slides again okay cortisol can cause</p><p>diabetes because it&rsquo;s constantly turning</p><p>turning on your body to make sugar</p><p>raising insulin and this is the reason</p><p>for the belly fat now there is a</p><p>difference between the visceral fat okay</p><p>in the superficial fat on your belly all</p><p>that visceral fat the fat around your</p><p>organs the fat around your heart the fat</p><p>around your kidneys the fat in and</p><p>around your liver the back fat the fat</p><p>over that surrounds the organ come from</p><p>insulin it&rsquo;s insulin derived but the</p><p>superficial fat is different it&rsquo;s</p><p>estrogen derived and that&rsquo;s why you see</p><p>women that have like in this extra layer</p><p>of fat than men like men don&rsquo;t have as</p><p>much but men do have that when a male</p><p>body gets the superficial fat what&rsquo;s</p><p>happening the estrogen is going up and</p><p>the testosterone is going down that&rsquo;s</p><p>why they get the man boobs right so the</p><p>superficial fat is the same thing with</p><p>the breast tissue and that is estrogen</p><p>estrogen inhibits testosterone so in a</p><p>male body this is not good okay but</p><p>that&rsquo;s I just wanted to point out the</p><p>difference between the two and you know</p><p>if you if you if you&rsquo;re if you don&rsquo;t</p><p>have a lot of this work that maybe you</p><p>just have some superficial fat then what</p><p>we need to do is we need to address the</p><p>estrogen piece okay</p><p>so I just want to talk about the adrenal</p><p>body type okay because many many people</p><p>this is the most common adrenal body</p><p>type and I want to cover some important</p><p>data on this the adrenal glands are the</p><p>stress gland of the body sit on top of</p><p>the kidney they create various symptoms</p><p>excessive thinking you know tired eyes</p><p>the need for coffee in the morning can&rsquo;t</p><p>wake up fatigue dispersed multitasking</p><p>but not can&rsquo;t focus on any one thing for</p><p>any period of time low stress tolerance</p><p>decrease libido that&rsquo;s this little fence</p><p>down here in the left lower corner high</p><p>blood pressure ah that&rsquo;s a inhaler</p><p>asthma allergies diabetes it&rsquo;s a</p><p>pinprick on the finger acne sleep apnea</p><p>leg cramps LP Shore hair loss brain fog</p><p>hot flashes facial hair the need to go</p><p>to the bathroom frequently sinus swollen</p><p>legs cravings for mainly salt uh breads</p><p>and chocolate okay also they get loose</p><p>skin and by the way that loose skin is</p><p>being converted into sugar by the way</p><p>loss of memory and concentration out of</p><p>breath climbing stairs a digestive</p><p>problem because when you&rsquo;re in stress</p><p>mode you don&rsquo;t digest like you should</p><p>heartburn acid reflux GERD and</p><p>irritability especially when with people</p><p>that are low calm like low I um I guess</p><p>it&rsquo;s like incompetent people people that</p><p>are slow</p><p>Oh stupid people you just they get on</p><p>your nerves easily and also the need to</p><p>take a nap after you eat and that&rsquo;s</p><p>because of the spike in sugar and</p><p>insulin okay I just showed you this book</p><p>right here but right up here it talks</p><p>about increased glucose output and</p><p>increases insulin so Wow interesting</p><p>okay so it messes with your body cause</p><p>osteoporosis a buffalo home</p><p>so this cortisol is being pumped out so</p><p>here&rsquo;s the thing the interesting thing</p><p>about the adrenals is that they don&rsquo;t</p><p>have an off switch</p><p>no they don&rsquo;t and what caused the</p><p>adrenal gland to get stuck on and pump</p><p>out cortisol is the accumulation of</p><p>stress and I want to just show you</p><p>something because all stress accumulates</p><p>the old stuff accumulates especially as</p><p>relate related to your eating I&rsquo;m sorry</p><p>related to when you started gaining</p><p>weight because take a look at how many</p><p>people have started gaining weight when</p><p>they&rsquo;re after a pregnancy hysterectomy</p><p>menopause after some change in hormonal</p><p>shift after a loss of level and injury</p><p>why is that because of stress activates</p><p>cortisol and increases insulin they</p><p>develop insulin resistance from the</p><p>cortisol interesting so if you just fix</p><p>the cortisol that you don&rsquo;t fix the</p><p>insulin resistance you may not get</p><p>better okay so the point is that all</p><p>your stress accumulates in your body so</p><p>that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to get a</p><p>history of all the past stuff that</p><p>happened to you okay I have a machine</p><p>that measures the stress in your body</p><p>and it&rsquo;s interesting because I can I can</p><p>actually see and even tell you what you</p><p>what you feel based on this graph this</p><p>person will wake up on the top you can</p><p>see that they&rsquo;re just totally jacked up</p><p>completely wired for sound they&rsquo;re</p><p>probably they&rsquo;re mine</p><p>is racing a mile a minute and they just</p><p>can&rsquo;t wind down but this person down</p><p>here has very low recovery because the</p><p>recovery should be all the way to the</p><p>right so the tall dial should be</p><p>straight up and down in the small dial</p><p>should be all the way to the right so</p><p>when someone has very low recovery they</p><p>don&rsquo;t tolerate stress there it didn&rsquo;t</p><p>sleep that well okay they have a high</p><p>degree of overwhelm okay all right so if</p><p>we look at the causes of insulin</p><p>resistance</p><p>we know the higher sugars will do it we</p><p>know lean proteins will do it especially</p><p>the concentrated whey protein and</p><p>combination so protein sugar will do it</p><p>lots of snacking and frequent eating</p><p>will do it msg and cortisol those are</p><p>the main factors okay the insulin is a</p><p>dominating hormone so even if you&rsquo;re</p><p>exercising and eating good if that</p><p>insulin is still high from insulin</p><p>resistance you&rsquo;re not losing any weight</p><p>because it inactivates all other</p><p>hormones and this is why people you know</p><p>they try to overcompensate with exercise</p><p>exercise is not going to work if you</p><p>haven&rsquo;t some resistance just try it see</p><p>how much weight you lose okay cortisol</p><p>also is a dominating hormone so in the</p><p>presence of stress it really is hard for</p><p>anything else to activate so we really</p><p>it really boils down to two things</p><p>stress and sugar and eating too frequent</p><p>okay let&rsquo;s just I&rsquo;m going to get into</p><p>now some solutions okay number one sleep</p><p>why because sleep reduces cortisol sleep</p><p>reduces insulin resistance if you&rsquo;re not</p><p>sleeping you&rsquo;re going to be more hungry</p><p>and you&rsquo;re going to want more sweets so</p><p>it&rsquo;s a really really key factor okay now</p><p>I developed a tool to help people sleep</p><p>it&rsquo;s very cool I want to show you I&rsquo;ll</p><p>show you how to calm one right here okay</p><p>so this is a little tool that I have</p><p>right here this is an um this is</p><p>developed by my hand there are certain</p><p>acupressure points on your body that</p><p>release stress and there&rsquo;s one right in</p><p>the back of the neck right here and you</p><p>can sit back on your couch or a tall</p><p>back chair and sit back and hit those</p><p>points I do this every night before I go</p><p>to bed two minutes out cold because it</p><p>hits these two points these two points</p><p>if you&rsquo;re if you know anything about</p><p>anatomy physiology are called the</p><p>parasympathetic points it&rsquo;s right by the</p><p>brainstem it triggers a relaxation these</p><p>are the sleep points back here and</p><p>there&rsquo;s about actually where is it I</p><p>have a little booklet with all the</p><p>maneuvers there&rsquo;s about 15 different</p><p>maneuvers that you can do with that tool</p><p>and it&rsquo;s basically designed to help</p><p>extract stress from the body so you can</p><p>sleep better it&rsquo;s wonderful okay so</p><p>that&rsquo;s one of the techniques that I</p><p>personally use to sleep okay now let me</p><p>just get back to this one thing here</p><p>okay okay so this is one technique</p><p>there&rsquo;s many other techniques number two</p><p>exercise exercise greatly helps insulin</p><p>resistance exercise also can help a hike</p><p>or so if it&rsquo;s low intensity but the key</p><p>with exercises you must make sure you</p><p>don&rsquo;t over train because you&rsquo;re going to</p><p>trigger cortisol but if you&rsquo;re not</p><p>exercising you need to start because</p><p>that will help insulin resistance okay</p><p>but go like that first okay zero sugars</p><p>now um</p><p>this is a this is the big one because</p><p>the purpose of fat check the sound the</p><p>purpose of fat every time I click off it</p><p>goes way back okay here&rsquo;s the thing the</p><p>purpose of fat is to protect you against</p><p>the starvation of sugar okay so it&rsquo;s a</p><p>backup fuel for sugar so in order to tap</p><p>in the fat we must bring sugar down to</p><p>zero okay so if we&rsquo;re doing a low carb</p><p>it might not be zero low carb just has</p><p>enough in sugar to keep instant high</p><p>because remember it&rsquo;s only the lack of</p><p>insulin that does this so we have to go</p><p>ultra low so now we&rsquo;re going to take</p><p>away something from you and you&rsquo;re not</p><p>going to like that so we have to</p><p>substitute it with something that&rsquo;s why</p><p>I created this book right here this is a</p><p>really good book that shows you recipes</p><p>and brownies I have a lot more in my</p><p>adrenal portal membership site which</p><p>I&rsquo;ll explain in a bit but these are</p><p>amazing recipes that allow you to</p><p>consume the foods you like but with no</p><p>sugar these are the good recipes there&rsquo;s</p><p>eighteen of them this is a good one</p><p>right here bread and also the cookie and</p><p>the peanut butter cup one so what I</p><p>suggest you do and I do this I take a</p><p>certain type of chocolate that&rsquo;s that</p><p>has no sugar and I put it with certain</p><p>salted roasted seeds or nuts like</p><p>sunflower seeds or pistachios or enough</p><p>or almonds and I&rsquo;ll put it in the</p><p>freezer and then I will just consume</p><p>this right after the meal not in between</p><p>the meal but right after as a little bit</p><p>of a snack now I don&rsquo;t need that anymore</p><p>but that was something that I did in the</p><p>past</p><p>and I do it occasionally just a little</p><p>bit but that&rsquo;s something you can do</p><p>because that way we don&rsquo;t have to</p><p>anything away from you you can just add</p><p>to it okay so there are solutions so you</p><p>don&rsquo;t have to feel deprived alright and</p><p>you can eat things and as you transition</p><p>to this if you had a recipe for a</p><p>chocolate cake for example you probably</p><p>be happy so if you had a recipe to</p><p>substitute anything like even ice cream</p><p>then you&rsquo;d be happy so that&rsquo;s what we</p><p>want to do is to give you some</p><p>ingredients but it&rsquo;s going to be a</p><p>little bit more fatty ingredients but it</p><p>tastes really good so I show you how to</p><p>make those as well okay so now let me</p><p>get back to the slides all right okay</p><p>hidden sugars fruits grains including</p><p>oatmeal yogurt especially even plain</p><p>because it has like ten grams of sugar</p><p>it&rsquo;s too much alcohol starches I&rsquo;m sorry</p><p>look at an apple has 19 grams of sugar</p><p>give me a break it&rsquo;s like eating a candy</p><p>bar yeah we can - the fiber but we still</p><p>have way too much sugar</p><p>okay so apples a nice to recommend them</p><p>but not any more</p><p>why because if you have stubborn weight</p><p>you&rsquo;re going to have to give up apples</p><p>right now I&rsquo;m sorry okay here are some</p><p>just pictures of some of the substitute</p><p>foods now all of these foods are loaded</p><p>with fat and no sugar okay so you get</p><p>the you get the pleasure you get the</p><p>sustaining from one meal to the next and</p><p>you get no insulin secretion so it&rsquo;s</p><p>really cool okay now number five one of</p><p>the things that you must do is increase</p><p>your potassium if you&rsquo;re going to reduce</p><p>both cortisol and insulin okay and</p><p>potassium will do it they will</p><p>help you but the problem is you need 47</p><p>hundred milligrams a day and that&rsquo;s a</p><p>lot</p><p>so that would eat that would be like</p><p>having ten bananas or five avocados</p><p>that&rsquo;s almost impossible so what are we</p><p>going to do we&rsquo;re going to get it from</p><p>our greens okay so one ounce equals</p><p>let&rsquo;s see one ounce of salad equals one</p><p>cup so we need about seven to ten cups</p><p>of vegetable or salad every single day</p><p>okay you what you&rsquo;re looking at is the</p><p>size of my salad</p><p>of course it&rsquo;s hard to hard to see this</p><p>but it&rsquo;s really not that hard it&rsquo;s like</p><p>a fluffy salad set in the ten cups I</p><p>have a big salad for lunch big one for</p><p>dinner I might blend kale with water and</p><p>I&rsquo;ll put a little of mine instant Cal</p><p>shake and make it taste better but the</p><p>point is you can drink your salad or</p><p>consume it but we need to increase the</p><p>salad for two reasons one is the</p><p>potassium and number two is to keep the</p><p>liver free of fat because we&rsquo;re going to</p><p>be dumping a lot of fat through your</p><p>body because you&rsquo;re going to lose weight</p><p>and the last thing I want to do is have</p><p>you end up with a fatty liver and this</p><p>is writing guidance physiology where he</p><p>talks about one of the problems with</p><p>reducing glucose is that it can cause a</p><p>fatty liver effect of insulin lack of</p><p>lack on causing a fire liver so that&rsquo;s</p><p>why the amount of vegetables that you</p><p>eat is really really really important</p><p>okay seven to ten cups every single day</p><p>okay number six if you&rsquo;re not hungry for</p><p>breakfast then make your lunch your</p><p>breakfast but this is what I consume for</p><p>breakfast this is what I did for eggs</p><p>avocado but guess what I barely have a</p><p>dinner so I really have like two and a</p><p>half miles but this gets me by and I can</p><p>go from one meal to the next I can</p><p>probably go all the way until two</p><p>o&rsquo;clock if I need to without any problem</p><p>at all</p><p>I&rsquo;m adding the fat in there to improve</p><p>the sustainability now if you&rsquo;re a guy</p><p>weigh 201 pounds right if you are</p><p>smaller just eat less you don&rsquo;t have to</p><p>have that much but it&rsquo;s very important</p><p>to have the protein breakfast because</p><p>then it sets your blood sugars in a good</p><p>place for the rest of the day and also</p><p>the fat buffers some of this protein</p><p>that you know I just love egg yolk and</p><p>bacon and avocado I just dig that okay</p><p>number seven intermittent fasting two to</p><p>three meals per day no snacking add more</p><p>fat per meal if you are hungry so you</p><p>just keep adjusting it right listen our</p><p>bodies I don&rsquo;t know whoever came up with</p><p>we need three meals a day or six meals a</p><p>day it&rsquo;s not natural to have eat that</p><p>often it&rsquo;s much better to have less</p><p>meals and just see a little bit more</p><p>until you&rsquo;re satisfied but your but you</p><p>want to be living off your own fat okay</p><p>so you say well what if I skip a meal</p><p>what am i eating well one of your meal</p><p>is your own fat on your body isn&rsquo;t that</p><p>the goal so you might initially feel a</p><p>little kind of empty but that&rsquo;s okay you</p><p>know as long as you&rsquo;re not too hungry</p><p>okay</p><p>apple cider vinegar is really good to</p><p>reverse insulin resistance so I would</p><p>recommend you can even take it in pill</p><p>form I have it on my website or you can</p><p>drink it take two tablespoons in a glass</p><p>of water and drink it with your meal and</p><p>you&rsquo;re going to see some really cool</p><p>effects also episode of vinegar into</p><p>plot gets rid of fat on your liver</p><p>additional small things lowering your</p><p>estrogen to are lowering high estrogen</p><p>because high estrogen can also increase</p><p>insulin like like I said the birth</p><p>control pills you know sediment helps a</p><p>little bit and increasing fiber does</p><p>help as well okay so I have a question</p><p>for you are you willing to make these</p><p>changes is</p><p>two of whelming if it is that&rsquo;s fine</p><p>take it on a gradient just do what you</p><p>can and work up to it I just wanted to</p><p>give you some really good solutions</p><p>because some of you already are doing a</p><p>lot of the things but you might not be</p><p>doing some of the things I&rsquo;m talking</p><p>about okay so for a lot of you you need</p><p>a little bit more help okay you need a</p><p>little bit more solution so plan a come</p><p>to my office and let us evaluate you
