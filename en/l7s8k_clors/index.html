about the rules of intermittent fasting i&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot of different videos on this topic but i just wanted to condense everything in just one video so let&amp;rsquo;s take it from the top a lot of times people want to know what can i eat with the fast what can i drink with a fast let&amp;rsquo;s talk first about drinking water is fine there&amp;rsquo;s a thing called a dry fast that&amp;rsquo;s a whole different topic but i do recommend drinking water tea is totally fine a certain type of teas can help you fast longer and decrease hunger because the herbs in tea help support your blood sugars and your liver coffee is fine i just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to overdo it but coffee will not knock you out of ketosis because tea coffee and water have basically zero calories so it&amp;rsquo;s just the amount of calories that could bump you out of fasting next question is can i take certain supplements when i&amp;rsquo;m fasting i recommend it especially vitamins electrolytes minerals b vitamins in the form of nutritional yeast trace minerals omega-3 fatty acids especially dha and so if you&amp;rsquo;re doing cod liver oil for example or fish oils the calories are going to be so small it&amp;rsquo;s going to not really interfere with your fasting ideally if you get a green drink without the fiber let&amp;rsquo;s say a wheatgrass juice powder you&amp;rsquo;re getting something that is super concentrated usually about 6 to 11 times less volume of material because it takes a lot of greens to make just a little bit of juice from that and so usually one serving when you add water comes out to less than one gram and so you get the boost of nutrition without messing up your fasting what you do want to avoid is the protein powders especially whey protein powder and there&amp;rsquo;s many other ones i would just avoid all protein powders also avoid branch chain amino acids because it will turn into sugar pretty quickly now as far as bone broth there&amp;rsquo;s mixed reviews some people do find that their ketosis actually stops for way too long and other people it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to affect their ability to generate ketones so this is mixed reviews you might want to try it out and see if you actually can do it or not get a little testing unit to check yourself now as far as mct oil which sometimes you&amp;rsquo;re going to put in your coffee to make it a bulletproof coffee you can put butter in it you can just put coconut oil or just put mct oil what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen is you&amp;rsquo;re not going to lower your ketones because those fats will turn into ketones but the only thing that&amp;rsquo;s going to happen if you do too much of this is you&amp;rsquo;re going to shift from burning your own fat to burning this fat and turning it into ketones now that&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing especially in the beginning as you&amp;rsquo;re making the transition into ketosis but at some point if you find that your weight loss is stalled then realize it could be this extra fat that you&amp;rsquo;re consuming but i actually do recommend it for a lot of people because it allows them to fast longer which is actually very very important because you want to get your body adapting and mct oil can give your brain straight ketones so there&amp;rsquo;s some other benefits to taking mct oil so it&amp;rsquo;s kind of depends on your situation okay number three don&amp;rsquo;t eat unless you&amp;rsquo;re hungry so when you start this fast and let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re gonna go 18 hours and your main goal is to lose weight and you find that you just completely have no appetite go a little longer now you don&amp;rsquo;t have to do a really long fast right off the beginning but you&amp;rsquo;re on a roll your body is eating it&amp;rsquo;s eating its own fat it&amp;rsquo;s not starving might as well ride the wave and go a little bit longer you&amp;rsquo;re going to see better results but you want to prevent the point of going too far where your body is weak and you feel dizzy so you want to be able to differentiate some slight hunger pains you&amp;rsquo;re a little hungry but you have a lot of energy and you have no cognitive problems might as well just push through that especially if it&amp;rsquo;s in the morning at eight o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning where you have this spike of cortisol where your body might be releasing more sugar but most people just push through that and then the hunger goes away but you&amp;rsquo;ve gone too far if you&amp;rsquo;re very weak and you&amp;rsquo;re fatigued and you&amp;rsquo;re dizzy and you have irritability all right number four the longer the fast the more you have to refeed slowly so if you&amp;rsquo;re fasting for 48 hours or longer make sure you consume just a small amount of food maybe a little egg a little lettuce maybe a little bit of peanut butter but not too much food too fast because what happens is that sometimes if you do a long fast especially if you&amp;rsquo;re getting like 72 hours or even longer and you have this huge meal your system is not ready for it and you can really feel kind of bloated nauseous and so i don&amp;rsquo;t recommend it so just do a little bit of food wait a little bit have a little bit more food kind of gradually go into it number five a good indication to know of the severity of insulin resistance is how long can you go without feeling like you need to eat food if you can fast easily over a period of time that means that you don&amp;rsquo;t have much insulin resistance left there&amp;rsquo;s not a problem now there&amp;rsquo;s other good indicators too like if you were to check your blood sugars and let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re fasting your blood sugars go up that means that you&amp;rsquo;re not quite out of the woods you have insulin resistance because your body is actually making more sugar it&amp;rsquo;s called gluconeogenesis because of certain mixed messages with insulin connecting to the liver and so if you can&amp;rsquo;t fast for a very long time all that means is you have insulin resistance and you have to just keep working on it you have to give it more time add more fat to the meal too which will make you more satisfied and allow you to go longer number six i recommend you always do keto with intermittent fasting i mean think about you&amp;rsquo;re getting all these great benefits with fasting why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you also want to get the benefits from keto which is also going to keep your insulin low when you eat if you&amp;rsquo;re fasting and then you go to a high carb diet you&amp;rsquo;re going to raise insulin raise your blood sugars and kind of minimize the effects of intermittent fasting all right number seven i recommend you do periodic prolonged fasting why because longer fasts give you additional benefits there are three really important benefits that most people get with just regular fasting not that long maybe 16 hours they&amp;rsquo;ll lose weight they&amp;rsquo;ll have cognitive benefits memory focus and concentration and they have mood benefits they go from anxiety or depression up to a higher level of emotion they just feel better a calm sense of well-being which is huge but when you do periodic prolonged fasting you really support your brain you grow new brain cells when you run your body on ketones there&amp;rsquo;s much less free radical damage there&amp;rsquo;s much less waste products being generated as compared to running your body in glucose where you have a lot more free radical damage and so ketones are more efficient fuel it&amp;rsquo;s less stress on your body it creates less waste and more oxygen and less co2 so it&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s good brain food also you&amp;rsquo;re going to support your immune system you&amp;rsquo;re going to be able to fight infections better you&amp;rsquo;re going to actually increase your resistance of your cell from toxins you&amp;rsquo;ll decrease your risk from cancer because one of the purposes of your immune system is to kill cancer cells this is a good benefit right and then you have the anti-aging benefits because your body is recycling old damaged tissue and definitely proteins so you&amp;rsquo;re cleaning up these cells that are dysfunctional and you&amp;rsquo;re renewing them so for repair and regeneration and anti-aging doing a prolonged fast here and there is definitely worth it all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you&amp;rsquo;re new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you&amp;rsquo;re on keto and you need a debug because it&amp;rsquo;s not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the u."><title>The 7 Important Intermittent Fasting Rules ｜ DrEricBergDC | SWIEST</title>

i&rsquo;ve done a lot of different videos on this topic  </p><p>but i just wanted to condense everything in 
just one video so let&rsquo;s take it from the top  </p><p>a lot of times people want to know what can i 
eat with the fast what can i drink with a fast  </p><p>let&rsquo;s talk first about drinking water is fine 
there&rsquo;s a thing called a dry fast that&rsquo;s a  </p><p>whole different topic but i do recommend drinking 
water tea is totally fine a certain type of teas  </p><p>can help you fast longer and decrease 
hunger because the herbs in tea  </p><p>help support your blood sugars and your liver 
coffee is fine i just wouldn&rsquo;t want to overdo  </p><p>it but coffee will not knock you out of ketosis 
because tea coffee and water have basically zero  </p><p>calories so it&rsquo;s just the amount of calories 
that could bump you out of fasting next question  </p><p>is can i take certain supplements when i&rsquo;m 
fasting i recommend it especially vitamins  </p><p>electrolytes minerals b vitamins in the form 
of nutritional yeast trace minerals omega-3  </p><p>fatty acids especially dha and so if you&rsquo;re 
doing cod liver oil for example or fish oils  </p><p>the calories are going to be so small 
it&rsquo;s going to not really interfere with  </p><p>your fasting ideally if you get a green drink 
without the fiber let&rsquo;s say a wheatgrass juice  </p><p>powder you&rsquo;re getting something that is super 
concentrated usually about 6 to 11 times  </p><p>less volume of material because it takes a lot 
of greens to make just a little bit of juice from  </p><p>that and so usually one serving when you add water 
comes out to less than one gram and so you get the  </p><p>boost of nutrition without messing up your fasting 
what you do want to avoid is the protein powders  </p><p>especially whey protein powder and there&rsquo;s many 
other ones i would just avoid all protein powders  </p><p>also avoid branch chain amino acids because 
it will turn into sugar pretty quickly now  </p><p>as far as bone broth there&rsquo;s mixed reviews some 
people do find that their ketosis actually stops  </p><p>for way too long and other people it doesn&rsquo;t seem 
to affect their ability to generate ketones so  </p><p>this is mixed reviews you might want to try it 
out and see if you actually can do it or not  </p><p>get a little testing unit to check yourself now as 
far as mct oil which sometimes you&rsquo;re going to put  </p><p>in your coffee to make it a bulletproof coffee you 
can put butter in it you can just put coconut oil  </p><p>or just put mct oil what&rsquo;s going to happen 
is you&rsquo;re not going to lower your ketones  </p><p>because those fats will turn into ketones but 
the only thing that&rsquo;s going to happen if you do  </p><p>too much of this is you&rsquo;re going to shift from 
burning your own fat to burning this fat and  </p><p>turning it into ketones now that&rsquo;s not necessarily 
a bad thing especially in the beginning as you&rsquo;re  </p><p>making the transition into ketosis but at some 
point if you find that your weight loss is stalled  </p><p>then realize it could be this extra fat that 
you&rsquo;re consuming but i actually do recommend  </p><p>it for a lot of people because it allows them to 
fast longer which is actually very very important  </p><p>because you want to get your body adapting and 
mct oil can give your brain straight ketones so  </p><p>there&rsquo;s some other benefits to taking mct oil so 
it&rsquo;s kind of depends on your situation okay number  </p><p>three don&rsquo;t eat unless you&rsquo;re hungry so when you 
start this fast and let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re gonna go 18  </p><p>hours and your main goal is to lose weight and you 
find that you just completely have no appetite go  </p><p>a little longer now you don&rsquo;t have to do a really 
long fast right off the beginning but you&rsquo;re on a  </p><p>roll your body is eating it&rsquo;s eating its own fat 
it&rsquo;s not starving might as well ride the wave  </p><p>and go a little bit longer you&rsquo;re going to see 
better results but you want to prevent the point  </p><p>of going too far where your body is weak and you 
feel dizzy so you want to be able to differentiate  </p><p>some slight hunger pains you&rsquo;re a little hungry 
but you have a lot of energy and you have no  </p><p>cognitive problems might as well just push through 
that especially if it&rsquo;s in the morning at eight  </p><p>o&rsquo;clock in the morning where you have this spike 
of cortisol where your body might be releasing  </p><p>more sugar but most people just push through that 
and then the hunger goes away but you&rsquo;ve gone too  </p><p>far if you&rsquo;re very weak and you&rsquo;re fatigued and 
you&rsquo;re dizzy and you have irritability all right  </p><p>number four the longer the fast the more you have 
to refeed slowly so if you&rsquo;re fasting for 48 hours  </p><p>or longer make sure you consume just a small 
amount of food maybe a little egg a little  </p><p>lettuce maybe a little bit of peanut butter but 
not too much food too fast because what happens is  </p><p>that sometimes if you do a long fast especially 
if you&rsquo;re getting like 72 hours or even longer  </p><p>and you have this huge meal your system is not 
ready for it and you can really feel kind of  </p><p>bloated nauseous and so i don&rsquo;t recommend it so 
just do a little bit of food wait a little bit  </p><p>have a little bit more food kind of gradually go 
into it number five a good indication to know of  </p><p>the severity of insulin resistance is how long can 
you go without feeling like you need to eat food  </p><p>if you can fast easily over a period of time that 
means that you don&rsquo;t have much insulin resistance  </p><p>left there&rsquo;s not a problem now 
there&rsquo;s other good indicators too  </p><p>like if you were to check your blood sugars and 
let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re fasting your blood sugars go  </p><p>up that means that you&rsquo;re not quite out of the 
woods you have insulin resistance because your  </p><p>body is actually making more sugar it&rsquo;s called 
gluconeogenesis because of certain mixed messages  </p><p>with insulin connecting to the liver and so if you 
can&rsquo;t fast for a very long time all that means is  </p><p>you have insulin resistance and you have to just 
keep working on it you have to give it more time  </p><p>add more fat to the meal too which will make 
you more satisfied and allow you to go longer  </p><p>number six i recommend you always do keto with 
intermittent fasting i mean think about you&rsquo;re  </p><p>getting all these great benefits with fasting why 
wouldn&rsquo;t you also want to get the benefits from  </p><p>keto which is also going to keep your insulin 
low when you eat if you&rsquo;re fasting and then you  </p><p>go to a high carb diet you&rsquo;re going to raise 
insulin raise your blood sugars and kind of  </p><p>minimize the effects of intermittent fasting all 
right number seven i recommend you do periodic  </p><p>prolonged fasting why because longer fasts give 
you additional benefits there are three really  </p><p>important benefits that most people get with 
just regular fasting not that long maybe 16 hours  </p><p>they&rsquo;ll lose weight they&rsquo;ll have cognitive 
benefits memory focus and concentration  </p><p>and they have mood benefits they 
go from anxiety or depression  </p><p>up to a higher level of emotion they just feel 
better a calm sense of well-being which is huge  </p><p>but when you do periodic prolonged fasting you 
really support your brain you grow new brain cells  </p><p>when you run your body on ketones there&rsquo;s much 
less free radical damage there&rsquo;s much less  </p><p>waste products being generated as compared to 
running your body in glucose where you have a  </p><p>lot more free radical damage and so ketones are 
more efficient fuel it&rsquo;s less stress on your body  </p><p>it creates less waste and more oxygen and less 
co2 so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s good brain food also you&rsquo;re  </p><p>going to support your immune system you&rsquo;re 
going to be able to fight infections better  </p><p>you&rsquo;re going to actually increase your resistance 
of your cell from toxins you&rsquo;ll decrease your risk  </p><p>from cancer because one of the 
purposes of your immune system is to  </p><p>kill cancer cells this is a good benefit right 
and then you have the anti-aging benefits because  </p><p>your body is recycling old damaged tissue and 
definitely proteins so you&rsquo;re cleaning up these  </p><p>cells that are dysfunctional and you&rsquo;re renewing 
them so for repair and regeneration and anti-aging  </p><p>doing a prolonged fast here and there is 
definitely worth it all right thanks for watching  </p><p>before you go if you have a question about a 
product or you&rsquo;re new to keto and you want to  </p><p>know how to begin keto or you&rsquo;re on keto and you 
need a debug because it&rsquo;s not going as smooth  </p><p>i have a keto consultant standing by to help you  </p><p>this is just for the people in the u.s. hopefully in 
the future we&rsquo;ll be able to answer everyone&rsquo;s call  </p><p>but i put the number down below
