    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Imam Dr. Omar Suleiman.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a Muslim scholar, civil rights leader,</p>
<p>founder and president of the Yaqeen Institute</p>
<p>for Islamic Research, and he&rsquo;s a professor</p>
<p>of Islamic studies at Southern Methodist University.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the most influential Muslims in the world</p>
<p>and is a fearless, kind-hearted human being</p>
<p>who I&rsquo;m now proud to call a friend.</p>
<p>As a side note, allow me to say a few words</p>
<p>about Israel and Palestine.</p>
<p>While this conversation with Omar Suleiman</p>
<p>was mostly exploring the history and beauty of Islam</p>
<p>and the Muslim community, we did delve briefly</p>
<p>into the topic of Israel and Palestine.</p>
<p>This topic is an extremely challenging one</p>
<p>and an extremely important one.</p>
<p>It has deep roots and implications in US politics,</p>
<p>in global geopolitics, in military and religious conflicts,</p>
<p>wars and atrocities, and basic struggle</p>
<p>of all human beings to survive, to protect their loved ones</p>
<p>and to flourish as individuals and as communities.</p>
<p>I did not want to cover this topic</p>
<p>in a solely scholarly fashion.</p>
<p>Much like with the war in Ukraine,</p>
<p>it is not simply a story of history, politics,</p>
<p>religion and national identity.</p>
<p>It is also a deeply human story.</p>
<p>To cover this topic in the way that my gut</p>
<p>and my heart says to do it, I have to talk to everyone,</p>
<p>to leaders and people on all sides,</p>
<p>Muslim and Jewish, Israeli and Palestinian,</p>
<p>from refugees to soldiers, from scholars to extremists.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s possible or wise,</p>
<p>but like Forrest Gump said, I&rsquo;m not a smart man.</p>
<p>And maybe you know how the rest of that goes.</p>
<p>I just like to follow my heart to whatever place it leads.</p>
<p>I ask the Muslim and the Jewish communities</p>
<p>for your patience and support as I explore this topic.</p>
<p>I will make many mistakes and I&rsquo;ll be listening</p>
<p>to all voices so I can learn and do better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve become distinctly aware that my approach</p>
<p>of talking to people from all walks of life</p>
<p>with empathy and compassion, but with backbone,</p>
<p>can create enemies on all sides.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t quite yet understand why this is,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m learning to accept it as the reality of the world.</p>
<p>Hopefully in the end, whatever happens,</p>
<p>whatever silly thing I do has a chance</p>
<p>of adding a bit of love to the world.</p>
<p>Thanks for going along with me on this journey.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got NetSuite for business management,</p>
<p>House of Macadamias for satiating delicious snack,</p>
<p>and ExpressVPN for privacy and security.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now, onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make these interesting, but if you skip them,</p>
<p>please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by NetSuite,</p>
<p>an all-in-one cloud business management system.</p>
<p>They manage financials, human resources,</p>
<p>inventory, e-commerce, and many business-related details.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much stuff involved in running a business.</p>
<p>This is something I think a lot about.</p>
<p>Because in me wanting to work for a company,</p>
<p>or me wanting to start a business,</p>
<p>you know, like a legit tech company that builds products,</p>
<p>that delivers products into the hands of people</p>
<p>and hopefully brings joy to their life,</p>
<p>hopefully adds a bit of love to the world.</p>
<p>To do that, it&rsquo;s not just about the design</p>
<p>and the engineering and the scaling</p>
<p>of the computer infrastructure</p>
<p>and even the hiring, the hiring decisions,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of stuff in the middle</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just very difficult to take care of,</p>
<p>and so you should use the best tools for the job.</p>
<p>And, you know, I have to be honest,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of aspects of that</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t understand as deeply as I should.</p>
<p>I think a lot of that you can catch up by reading books,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s just no replacement for experience.</p>
<p>Like I said, you should work with the best people,</p>
<p>but you should also use the best tools for the job.</p>
<p>You could do that if you go to netsuite.com slash Lex</p>
<p>to access their one-of-a-kind financing program.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by a sponsor</p>
<p>that brings a smile to my face every time I think about them</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re delicious.</p>
<p>Not the sponsor, but the thing they make.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s House of Macadamias.</p>
<p>They ship delicious, high-quality,</p>
<p>and healthy macadamia nuts directly to your door.</p>
<p>They have bars, whole nuts,</p>
<p>whole nuts mixed with a bunch of different stuff</p>
<p>that makes it all super delicious.</p>
<p>I mean, I try not to consume all the snacks</p>
<p>that I get from them, that I purchase from them,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m trying to actually have like a snack thing</p>
<p>for guests when they come over if they&rsquo;re sort of hungry</p>
<p>or they need a little bit more energy</p>
<p>for the longer conversations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get the House of Macadamia nuts snacks there</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re small portions, super delicious,</p>
<p>very healthy, you know, all of the,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of variety,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no way you can go wrong</p>
<p>with any of the options.</p>
<p>And so I like to be a professional adult,</p>
<p>responsible kind of human being that, you know,</p>
<p>cares about the joy and the well-being</p>
<p>of the guests that come over.</p>
<p>Yeah, so House of Macadamia nuts</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t just make me happy.</p>
<p>They provide the possibility, the infinite possibility</p>
<p>of joyous snackage for the guests that come over.</p>
<p>So I think last time see Grimes was over,</p>
<p>somebody that I&rsquo;ve gotten to know more</p>
<p>over the past few months.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a brilliant, brilliant artist,</p>
<p>but just a fascinating human being.</p>
<p>And one of the things she kind of inspires me to do</p>
<p>is to take care of the studio environment,</p>
<p>of the place that people come to to have a conversation,</p>
<p>you know, to really create an experience.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something I really haven&rsquo;t really invested on.</p>
<p>House of Macadamia is my first step</p>
<p>into creating a delicious, joyous experience</p>
<p>for the amazing folks that come over for a podcast.</p>

<p>This show is also brought to you by ExpressVPN.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used them for many, many, many, many years.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s been, I mean,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the number is.</p>
<p>I wonder when it gets to 10 years,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s been like seven, eight years</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been using them.</p>
<p>A VPN is obviously really important,</p>
<p>or maybe if it&rsquo;s not obvious to you,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t use a VPN,</p>
<p>I think you should really be using a VPN</p>
<p>for many activities that you do.</p>
<p>Protects your privacy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of features that allows you to do,</p>
<p>like if you watch Netflix and you want to get access</p>
<p>to a geographically restricted content,</p>
<p>it allows you to do that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just a good tool to have in your toolbox</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re on the internet.</p>
<p>And my favorite VPN by far,</p>
<p>the one I always recommend is ExpressVPN.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used it for many, many years.</p>
<p>Makes me super happy.</p>
<p>It works on any operating system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super fast.</p>
<p>Click a button, pick a location.</p>
<p>It just works.</p>
<p>It does one thing, and it does it extremely well,</p>
<p>which is what I love from software and from,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, from anybody.</p>
<p>I love meeting people that just are extremely competent</p>
<p>and passionate about one thing,</p>
<p>and they do that thing better</p>
<p>than anybody I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>And that sort of fills me with joy,</p>
<p>just admiring their excellence.</p>
<p>And even more than that,</p>
<p>just admiring their joy at the thing they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>their lifelong passion manifested</p>
<p>in this one very specific activity.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful to see.</p>
<p>And so ExpressVPN, in some way, represents that for me.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Omar Suleiman.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>As-salamu alaykum, Omar.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been trying to do this a long time.</p>
<p>The world tried to prevent it</p>
<p>through the funny ways that the world does,</p>
<p>but here we are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of yours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge honor to talk to you.</p>
<p>I appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thank you for making the sacrifice</p>
<p>and coming down, or coming up, I guess, to Dallas.</p>
<p>I appreciate it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a short flight, but a long journey.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the biggest question.</p>
<p>Who is God, according to Islam?</p>
<p>God is the most compassionate, the most merciful,</p>
<p>the creator of the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>He is one God.</p>
<p>He begets not, nor is he begotten.</p>
<p>He is unique.</p>
<p>He is omnipotent.</p>
<p>He is beyond the limitations of man.</p>
<p>He is beyond the constructs of our imagination.</p>
<p>But he is ever accessible through sincere supplication.</p>
<p>When you call upon him alone, one God,</p>
<p>he is closer to you than your jugular vein,</p>
<p>the Quran tells us.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s known by many names and attributes,</p>
<p>but his essence is one.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one God.</p>
<p>No human likeness, no human imperfection</p>
<p>can be attributed to him.</p>
<p>No partners, no image of him can be constructed.</p>
<p>And that is God.</p>
<p>So God represents, he is a feeling of closeness</p>
<p>that is accessible to every human being?</p>
<p>Well, God&rsquo;s not a feeling.</p>
<p>God is known by names and attributes.</p>
<p>We call upon God, but there is certainly</p>
<p>a feeling of closeness when you access him.</p>
<p>So I think the beauty of Islam is that</p>
<p>as perfect as God is described,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s also so accessible to the imperfect.</p>
<p>And so the idea of sincere supplication</p>
<p>and connection to him, we worship him alone.</p>
<p>We call upon him alone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no clergy, there&rsquo;s no barrier</p>
<p>between God and us.</p>
<p>And that encourages a sincere devotion</p>
<p>and commitment to him alone.</p>
<p>And so he is certainly described supreme.</p>
<p>And God speaks to us through the Quran.</p>
<p>And we speak to him through sincere supplication.</p>
<p>And his attributes are the furthest from us</p>
<p>in terms of their perfection.</p>
<p>But he is ever close to us through our supplication,</p>
<p>through our prayers, and through our connection to him.</p>
<p>To open the door to that connection,</p>
<p>to have a connection with God,</p>
<p>how difficult is that process?</p>
<p>How difficult was it for you?</p>
<p>How difficult is it for the people that,</p>
<p>for the many, many, many Muslims</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve interacted with?</p>
<p>Well, I think that there are different</p>
<p>layers of difficulty, right?</p>
<p>There is the personal difficulty,</p>
<p>submitting yourself to God.</p>
<p>You know, Islam requires a complete submission to him.</p>
<p>And one of the things that happens is that</p>
<p>if we project some of our bad experiences</p>
<p>with authority onto our relationship with God,</p>
<p>then we immediately perceive him in a certain way</p>
<p>that might not allow us to gain a closeness to him.</p>
<p>Because maybe we didn&rsquo;t have the best relationship</p>
<p>with our parents growing up.</p>
<p>Maybe we didn&rsquo;t have the best relationship</p>
<p>with authority figures in our lives.</p>
<p>And so this idea of an ultimate authority</p>
<p>to whom you submit yourself can be very difficult.</p>
<p>You know, Malcolm X, who was one of the most prominent</p>
<p>converts to Islam in American history,</p>
<p>talked about the difficulty of prostration</p>
<p>for the very first time.</p>
<p>Putting your head on the ground,</p>
<p>putting your face on the ground,</p>
<p>and praying to God is a very humbling thing.</p>
<p>Submitting all of your affairs to him is very humbling.</p>
<p>And ultimately, you have to relinquish control.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t relinquish control without trust.</p>
<p>So you have to learn to trust God.</p>
<p>To trust God, you have to know him.</p>
<p>And to know him is to love him.</p>
<p>And so for me personally, you know, growing up,</p>
<p>going through certain difficulties,</p>
<p>having a sick parent who struggled in her life</p>
<p>with cancer and with strokes,</p>
<p>dealing with racism in South Louisiana growing up,</p>
<p>it was important for me to learn about God</p>
<p>through my difficulties, for example,</p>
<p>rather than let those difficulties turn me away from him.</p>
<p>Many times people put a barrier between them and God</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t make sense of the things</p>
<p>that are happening in their own lives.</p>
<p>And so they project anger towards God</p>
<p>and at the same time deny their own belief in him</p>
<p>and do away with this natural disposition</p>
<p>that every one of us has to believe in him.</p>
<p>So there are intellectual barriers, certainly.</p>
<p>There are experiential barriers.</p>
<p>But I think that one of the beautiful things</p>
<p>about Islam is clarity.</p>
<p>There is an explanation for his existence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an explanation for our existence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an explanation for the existence</p>
<p>of difficulties and trial,</p>
<p>an explanation for the existence</p>
<p>of desires and distractions.</p>
<p>And it all comes together so beautifully</p>
<p>and coherently in Islam.</p>
<p>And so I think that for many of us,</p>
<p>we want to be our own gods.</p>
<p>And ultimately we create and fashion gods</p>
<p>in ways that allow us to still be the ultimate determiners</p>
<p>of our own fates, of our own story.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very unfulfilling when you fail at your own plan.</p>
<p>But when you realize that there is one who is all-knowing,</p>
<p>that there is one who is all-wise,</p>
<p>you actually find peace in submitting yourself to him.</p>
<p>And so submitting your will to him,</p>
<p>submitting your desires, submitting your own fate to him,</p>
<p>becomes actually an experience of liberation</p>
<p>because you trust the one that you&rsquo;re submitting to.</p>
<p>You trust his knowledge over yours.</p>
<p>You trust his wisdom over yours.</p>
<p>And that gives you a lot of peace.</p>
<p>And then you have direct access to him.</p>
<p>You pray to him, you call upon him, you supplicate.</p>
<p>And everything in your life suddenly has meaning.</p>
<p>You know, in our faith, everything is about intention.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an intentionality even behind</p>
<p>the most seemingly most mundane actions.</p>
<p>A morsel of food in the mouth of your spouse,</p>
<p>your family is looked at as a great charity.</p>
<p>The way that you enter into a place</p>
<p>and exit out of a place,</p>
<p>what foot you step in, what foot you step out with,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an intentionality.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a word of remembrance that&rsquo;s spoken.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a word of praise before</p>
<p>and after you engage in any action.</p>
<p>There are things that you say before you eat,</p>
<p>before you sleep.</p>
<p>There is meaning even to your sleep.</p>
<p>One of the great companions of the Prophet Muhammad,</p>
<p>peace and blessings be upon him,</p>
<p>he said that I seek the reward for my sleep</p>
<p>just as I seek the reward for my prayer.</p>
<p>Because you sleep to refresh yourself</p>
<p>so that you can once again do great things.</p>
<p>And the intentionality behind that</p>
<p>allows even the sleep to be rewardable.</p>
<p>You eat to nourish yourself so that you can do great things.</p>
<p>You seek to be in a position of independence</p>
<p>and of being sustained so that you can sustain others.</p>
<p>So the Prophet, peace be upon him, says, for example,</p>
<p>that the upper hand is better than the lower hand.</p>
<p>The upper hand is the giving hand,</p>
<p>the lower hand is the receiving hand.</p>
<p>So to seek a position where you can help other people,</p>
<p>everything becomes intentional.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no such thing as, you know,</p>
<p>something that is meaningless and without purpose.</p>
<p>So every pursuit is ultimately a pursuit of God.</p>
<p>And when you pursue God sincerely,</p>
<p>then he rewards you, not just with paradise</p>
<p>in the afterlife, but he rewards you</p>
<p>with a great sense of serenity and self-satisfaction here.</p>
<p>You mentioned part of the struggle growing up</p>
<p>was having a parent, your mom, who was sick.</p>
<p>What do you remember about your mom?</p>
<p>What are some happy, pleasant memories?</p>
<p>So my parents were, well, my father,</p>
<p>thank God, is still alive.</p>
<p>My mother was a pious woman, a beautiful woman,</p>
<p>a righteous woman, a woman who was known</p>
<p>for treating everyone with a great deal of love and respect.</p>
<p>She was a poet.</p>
<p>She used to write poetry about oppressed peoples</p>
<p>around the world.</p>
<p>From her homeland in Palestine to the genocide in Bosnia,</p>
<p>she followed every conflict before social media</p>
<p>and poured her heart into it.</p>
<p>She was a woman of great charity.</p>
<p>So when I think back to my mom growing up,</p>
<p>she was known for her smile.</p>
<p>My mom was always smiling.</p>
<p>And in fact, every picture of her, she&rsquo;s smiling.</p>
<p>And at her funeral, you know, people talked about her smile,</p>
<p>that she would smile at everyone.</p>
<p>And that was kind of her thing.</p>
<p>So if you were left out of a gathering,</p>
<p>she was smiling at you and she&rsquo;d kind of welcome you in.</p>
<p>I remember my mom to be content.</p>
<p>She was a woman of prayer and a woman of contentment.</p>
<p>So I used to see her in her prayer clothes all the time.</p>
<p>In fact, when I think back to her growing up,</p>
<p>I think of her more in her prayer clothes</p>
<p>than in her normal clothes,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how often she was engaged in prayer.</p>
<p>And I think of her making sure that everyone</p>
<p>was included in a conversation.</p>
<p>So she was very interesting in that she had several strokes</p>
<p>and each one of those strokes impaired one of her senses</p>
<p>to some extent.</p>
<p>So she was partially deaf because of one stroke.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;d be sitting in a gathering</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;d be pretty quiet with a big smile on her face,</p>
<p>very serene.</p>
<p>And she would tell me, you know,</p>
<p>alhamdulillah, which means thank God,</p>
<p>all praise be to God that I can&rsquo;t hear</p>
<p>because I can tell when people are gossiping,</p>
<p>when people are saying negative things around me</p>
<p>about other people, because she says,</p>
<p>even the look on people&rsquo;s faces changes.</p>
<p>So it was really interesting</p>
<p>because she was that spiritually rooted and deep</p>
<p>that she said like you could see</p>
<p>on the looks on people&rsquo;s faces</p>
<p>when they started to speak ill about other people</p>
<p>that their faces would change,</p>
<p>that their demeanor would change.</p>
<p>And she said, I would actually praise the Lord</p>
<p>that I couldn&rsquo;t engage in those conversations</p>
<p>and that I wasn&rsquo;t sinful for hearing them.</p>
<p>And what she would do is what people said at her funeral,</p>
<p>which was really beautiful to me</p>
<p>and it was very comforting to me.</p>
<p>And I took it as a life mission</p>
<p>that if you were new to a place</p>
<p>or if you were kind of in the corner</p>
<p>and not known to other people in the community</p>
<p>and you felt left out,</p>
<p>she was the one that literally would look around the room</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;d see who was standing in the corner</p>
<p>and who was new to the community or new to whatever place.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;d go and try to include that person</p>
<p>in the gathering.</p>
<p>So even when she had impaired speech and impaired hearing</p>
<p>with her smile and with her warmth,</p>
<p>she was able to welcome people wherever that was.</p>
<p>And so the amount of people that came to her funeral</p>
<p>and the stories that I continue to hear till this day,</p>
<p>15 years later after her passing away,</p>
<p>of people that said, no one ever treated me</p>
<p>the way your mother treated me.</p>
<p>And she connected that to God.</p>
<p>So that was actually part of my faith journey.</p>
<p>When I think of great people,</p>
<p>when I think of people of faith,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s the first person that comes to my mind</p>
<p>because despite her challenges,</p>
<p>she was always the greatest person that you would meet.</p>
<p>Anyone that met her and that knew her would say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never met anyone that kind.</p>
<p>That was her reputation.</p>
<p>And she was deeply empathetic.</p>
<p>She would shed tears over people</p>
<p>that she had no connection to.</p>
<p>This is again, before social media,</p>
<p>before the heavy exposure that we have</p>
<p>to people in conflict zones.</p>
<p>She had to engage every single human being in her life</p>
<p>in a deep and profound way</p>
<p>because she had a profound connection to God.</p>
<p>And she believed that that was her calling.</p>
<p>And none of her challenges made her bitter.</p>
<p>In fact, they only made her more connected to God</p>
<p>and they only made her a better person</p>
<p>until the last breath that she took.</p>
<p>Do you miss her?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>But I feel like everything I do is an extension of her.</p>
<p>So you try to carry what she stood for.</p>
<p>As part of yourself.</p>
<p>The prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him,</p>
<p>said that when a person passes away,</p>
<p>there are only three things that continue to benefit them,</p>
<p>that continue to extend them.</p>
<p>A continuous charity or a piece of knowledge</p>
<p>that continues to benefit people</p>
<p>or a righteous child that prays for them.</p>
<p>And I want to be that child that prays for her,</p>
<p>but also does charity in her name extends her charity,</p>
<p>extends what she taught me by being the person that she was.</p>
<p>To everyone around me.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some times</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t feel like getting out of bed.</p>
<p>Sometimes where I don&rsquo;t feel like doing for myself,</p>
<p>but I actually feel like doing for her.</p>
<p>So everything in my life that I try to do,</p>
<p>I try to make it an extension of her.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been my calling.</p>
<p>And I believe I&rsquo;ll meet her again.</p>
<p>I believe I&rsquo;ll be with her again.</p>
<p>I believe that everything I do that is good</p>
<p>will be of benefit to her.</p>
<p>And I believe that it would make her proud.</p>
<p>And so as much as I miss her,</p>
<p>as much as I am fueled to do for her.</p>
<p>And so I continue that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of become part of my life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been my life story as a child.</p>
<p>And as an adult,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been sort of the centerpiece of my life</p>
<p>to do things that extend her.</p>
<p>And ultimately in the process hopefully benefit me</p>
<p>because I believe that she&rsquo;s a woman</p>
<p>who I pray is destined for paradise.</p>
<p>And I wanna do the things that would get me there too.</p>
<p>What did you learn about death,</p>
<p>about life from losing her?</p>
<p>I feel like the facade of the material world</p>
<p>was made evident to me at a very young age.</p>
<p>Most children grow up</p>
<p>and their parents wanna protect them from everything.</p>
<p>And I felt that too.</p>
<p>My mother wanted to downplay her own tragedy</p>
<p>so that me and my brother could live a fruitful</p>
<p>and fulfilling life.</p>
<p>My father wanted to protect us</p>
<p>from the hardship of her life</p>
<p>so that we could live fulfilling lives.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d often be the only father on a field trip,</p>
<p>even though he was a distinguished professor.</p>
<p>I mean, he was a busy man.</p>
<p>He was a very busy man,</p>
<p>but he tried to show up at a field trip</p>
<p>and tried to make our lives as normal as possible.</p>
<p>But in the process,</p>
<p>we always understood that there was more to life</p>
<p>than what other children were seeing it as.</p>
<p>And now I know that as an adult,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more to life than what other adults see it as.</p>
<p>The material world disappointed early on</p>
<p>so that we could see beyond it.</p>
<p>And I often tell people that,</p>
<p>there are many that grow up in tragedy, orphan children,</p>
<p>refugees that grow up and do incredible things</p>
<p>because they immediately see past the facade.</p>
<p>They see through all of the material promises of this world,</p>
<p>the deception of it.</p>
<p>And that you can choose to be bitter as a result of that,</p>
<p>or you can choose to be better.</p>
<p>And I think that for me,</p>
<p>I had to consciously make that decision</p>
<p>that I was going to live a life of prayer.</p>
<p>I was going to live a life of charity.</p>
<p>I was going to live a life of commitment.</p>
<p>And in that process, invest in something that&rsquo;s greater,</p>
<p>invest in something that doesn&rsquo;t disappoint.</p>
<p>And so I believe in God.</p>
<p>I believe in the hereafter.</p>
<p>And I believe that God will not let any trial</p>
<p>or effort in this life go to waste</p>
<p>without it being repaid in the hereafter.</p>
<p>And so I work towards that.</p>
<p>And so life and death,</p>
<p>I understood existence to be transcendent early on.</p>
<p>That if I believed that there was nothing to life</p>
<p>except for life, I would be a very bitter person.</p>
<p>But because I know that there is more to it than this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m able to exist in it without being depressed by it.</p>
<p>Existence is transcendence.</p>
<p>What happens after we die?</p>
<p>After the material instantiation fades away?</p>
<p>Material instantiation fades away.</p>
<p>So the Quran tells us that God brought us</p>
<p>from the darkness of the womb into this life.</p>
<p>You were nothing but a dirty drop of fluid</p>
<p>and you became this fully proportioned human being</p>
<p>from the darkness of the womb.</p>
<p>You come into this life, you experience it,</p>
<p>and then you go to the darkness of the grave</p>
<p>only to be resurrected once again.</p>
<p>That we are souls with bodies, not bodies with souls.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a huge difference between those two things.</p>
<p>This is the vehicle that contains us here.</p>
<p>This is the material world that we encounter here.</p>
<p>But we are not this.</p>
<p>And this is not our entire existence.</p>
<p>And so the soul continues.</p>
<p>This is a life in which we seek to worship him</p>
<p>and seek to live in accordance with the purpose</p>
<p>that he has set out for us.</p>
<p>And after we pass away, our soul continues onwards,</p>
<p>either to reward or to punishment or to a mixture of both.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a realm of accountability.</p>
<p>And hopefully it&rsquo;s a realm of reward</p>
<p>should we exist in a way that he wants us to exist.</p>
<p>So you said that you can look to God for wisdom</p>
<p>to make sense of the world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of stuff to us humans</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s difficult to make sense of.</p>
<p>Like you losing your mother.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of cruelty in the world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of suffering in the world.</p>
<p>What wisdom have you been able to find from God</p>
<p>about why there is suffering in the world,</p>
<p>why there&rsquo;s cruelty?</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a saying that I wanted to ask God</p>
<p>about why he allows hunger and war and poverty.</p>
<p>But I was afraid he might ask me the same question.</p>
<p>God has certainly given us enough food.</p>
<p>There is enough food in the world</p>
<p>for everyone to have a 3,200 calorie diet a day.</p>
<p>God has certainly given us enough guidance</p>
<p>for us to not inflict on each other</p>
<p>the cruelty that we inflict.</p>
<p>When we look to the world around us,</p>
<p>first and foremost,</p>
<p>we have to have a sense of accountability.</p>
<p>We are accountable for our own actions.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t blame God for the evil of man.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>we understand that God and his wisdom</p>
<p>allows for certain outcomes</p>
<p>that we cannot encompass with our own.</p>
<p>And that to isolate these incidents</p>
<p>and to try to make sense of them</p>
<p>is no different than a baby in the womb</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t understand the world that it&rsquo;s coming into</p>
<p>and trying to explain to that baby</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t yet developed its own senses</p>
<p>and its own perception of this world</p>
<p>what is happening to it, right?</p>
<p>I often think of the example of a child</p>
<p>and having been at this point now</p>
<p>through the experience of parenthood,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still learning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going into having a teenager with three kids</p>
<p>and being a softie for my kids</p>
<p>when you have to tell your child</p>
<p>that they can&rsquo;t have something</p>
<p>that they really, really want.</p>
<p>And that child thinks you hate them at some point</p>
<p>because why are you stopping me</p>
<p>from putting this toy in my mouth</p>
<p>and choking myself?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t get it, right?</p>
<p>But at the same time, you prevent them out of love.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not in a position to understand</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re preventing them out of love.</p>
<p>And to isolate these incidents with God</p>
<p>and to say the wisdom, what&rsquo;s the wisdom?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to make sense of a pixel</p>
<p>when you can&rsquo;t see the bigger picture.</p>
<p>Your mind is not at a place</p>
<p>where you can make sense of the bigger picture.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t seen the bigger picture.</p>
<p>And so for him to even explain to us every incident</p>
<p>would completely defeat the purpose</p>
<p>of putting your trust in him.</p>
<p>So we believe in a God that is all encompassing</p>
<p>in his knowledge and wisdom that gives us,</p>
<p>and Islam is very specific by the way</p>
<p>that there is what God tells us to do</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s what God allows to happen.</p>
<p>So what God tells us to do</p>
<p>in terms of the roadmap towards good</p>
<p>and then what God allows to happen in his divine wisdom</p>
<p>that no outcome can escape him,</p>
<p>but at the same time we are accountable</p>
<p>for our own actions and our own deeds.</p>
<p>So when you come to someone and say,</p>
<p>why did God allow this to happen to this person?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t rationalize that for you</p>
<p>because my understanding is relegated</p>
<p>to the immediate experience in front of me.</p>
<p>But if I know God and if I learn about God</p>
<p>then I don&rsquo;t have to make sense of the plan</p>
<p>but I can tell you that I trust the planner.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s where peace is found.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of times you look for the light</p>
<p>at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the light at the end of the tunnel?</p>
<p>In Islam there&rsquo;s emphasis on God and the hereafter</p>
<p>because to try to make sense of divine decree</p>
<p>and why certain things happen in this world</p>
<p>without the existence of a God</p>
<p>or without the existence of a hereafter</p>
<p>will always fail you.</p>
<p>So the existence of a God that is all knowing</p>
<p>what we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I know what you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that understands what we don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>The existence of a God who is not subject</p>
<p>to our constrictions and the existence of a hereafter</p>
<p>where all things find recourse,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s divine recourse</p>
<p>allows for this world to be situated</p>
<p>within the existence of something greater</p>
<p>and not treated in isolation.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re trying to treat an incident</p>
<p>of this world in isolation, you&rsquo;re going to fail.</p>
<p>And when you try to treat existence in this world</p>
<p>and of this world in isolation, you&rsquo;re also going to fail.</p>
<p>And so the emphasis is the belief in God,</p>
<p>a God that is not limited like you are</p>
<p>and a belief in the hereafter</p>
<p>that is not limited like this life.</p>
<p>And so everything continues onwards</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s divine recourse for everything,</p>
<p>each and everything.</p>
<p>The prophet Muhammad peace and blessings be upon him</p>
<p>mentions that on the day of judgment,</p>
<p>a person who lived the most difficult of lives</p>
<p>will be dipped into paradise one time</p>
<p>and will be told, have you ever seen any sadness,</p>
<p>any hardship?</p>
<p>Now, when you think about the most difficult life,</p>
<p>some of the commentators in Islam,</p>
<p>they said that this is perhaps referring</p>
<p>to the prophet Job, Ayyub peace be upon him,</p>
<p>because Job lived obviously a life of great difficulty,</p>
<p>but that a person who lived a very hard life</p>
<p>would be dipped into paradise one time.</p>
<p>And just with a dip be asked,</p>
<p>have you ever seen any hardship?</p>
<p>Have you ever seen any misery?</p>
<p>And that person would say, what is sadness?</p>
<p>What is hardship?</p>
<p>What is misery?</p>
<p>Now, if you don&rsquo;t believe in the hereafter,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t believe in anything beyond this life,</p>
<p>then the recourse has to happen in this life.</p>
<p>And because we see so many people pass through this life</p>
<p>without recourse of cruelty, without recourse of suffering,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re forced to try to make sense of it.</p>
<p>And if you are someone who believes</p>
<p>that this entire world came into existence</p>
<p>through randomness, that we&rsquo;re just an existence</p>
<p>of random atoms that collide with each other</p>
<p>and that all of this comes together out of nothing,</p>
<p>then how can you put your trust</p>
<p>in anything that is greater?</p>
<p>So, you asked me as a child of a parent who suffered,</p>
<p>I believe that every moment that my mother suffered,</p>
<p>that she will be rewarded, that she will be elevated,</p>
<p>that all of that made her or contributed</p>
<p>to the beautiful person that she was</p>
<p>and will contribute to the beautiful reward</p>
<p>that she receives, and the recourse is certain</p>
<p>to me as a believer in that.</p>
<p>So, the right approach to making sense of the world,</p>
<p>especially making sense of suffering and cruelty</p>
<p>is that of humility that we as humans</p>
<p>cannot possibly understand fully.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>In fact, in the Quran, it&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>When God creates Adam, the angels say to God,</p>
<p>are you going to create a race or a species</p>
<p>that will spill blood and cause corruption?</p>
<p>And God says to the angels in response to that question,</p>
<p>I know that which you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So, even the angels have to humble themselves for a moment.</p>
<p>The angels who adore God, who love God,</p>
<p>who worship Him, who obey Him unconditionally,</p>
<p>they are told by God, I know that which you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And what we extract from that,</p>
<p>what many of the early interpretations extract from that</p>
<p>is that God knows that there are human beings</p>
<p>that will come out of this enterprise of humanity</p>
<p>that make the entire existence of it worth it.</p>
<p>And so, just as yes, there will be criminals</p>
<p>and corrupt ones, there will be prophets</p>
<p>and beautiful people that come out of this</p>
<p>and sages and saints that come out of this</p>
<p>that show that a human being, who unlike an angel</p>
<p>who has no choice but to worship God,</p>
<p>an angel has no sense of will, no sense of choice.</p>
<p>An angel is created to worship and has no desires.</p>
<p>A human being who has the choice of desire and worship,</p>
<p>the choice of righteousness and wickedness,</p>
<p>that there are human beings who will choose worship</p>
<p>and righteousness, that will choose charity over cruelty,</p>
<p>that will choose service and choose dedication</p>
<p>and devotion over death and destruction,</p>
<p>that there are human beings that will in fact</p>
<p>ascend the angels in rank because they will live lives</p>
<p>where they choose that capacity, that part of themselves,</p>
<p>and they lean into that and worship God lovingly</p>
<p>and obey him.</p>
<p>You see, some of the sages and Islam scholars,</p>
<p>they describe this as saying that the human being</p>
<p>has the capacity to be anywhere from an animal to an angel,</p>
<p>or even worse, to be a devil to an angel.</p>
<p>Not in the sense that we ever actually become angels</p>
<p>or become animals, but that an animal, for the most part,</p>
<p>seeks its desires over everything,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really think about many of the things</p>
<p>that we are supposed to calculate as human beings,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t think about which territory it&rsquo;s infringing upon</p>
<p>or how much of its appetite it should fulfill.</p>
<p>It simply exists to fulfill its appetite</p>
<p>and that many human beings simply exist</p>
<p>to fulfill their appetite.</p>
<p>And they choose that over worship or reason</p>
<p>or anything that is greater,</p>
<p>just they literally take their selves as gods in that sense</p>
<p>and their selves have no limitation on appetite.</p>
<p>So they just keep filling that appetite</p>
<p>and filling that appetite and filling that appetite.</p>
<p>Whereas a human being can also go to the extent</p>
<p>of choosing something greater</p>
<p>and disciplining their desires, disciplining their selves,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re seeking a greater reward.</p>
<p>We know many people that achieve great things</p>
<p>in the worldly sense, because they choose</p>
<p>to study over sleep, for example.</p>
<p>They choose to exert themselves towards their careers,</p>
<p>towards their education, because they believe</p>
<p>that ultimately the outcome of those pursuits</p>
<p>are more rewarding than the immediate fulfillment</p>
<p>of their desires.</p>
<p>So as believers, we choose that love of God</p>
<p>and we choose that outcome that we seek</p>
<p>and we discipline ourselves</p>
<p>to where we can even ascend past the angels in rank.</p>
<p>Now, of course, I said, we can go as low as an animal</p>
<p>or even as low as a devil.</p>
<p>And we have tyrants past and present and future as well</p>
<p>that can become satanic in their nature</p>
<p>because they allow their desires</p>
<p>to take such control over them</p>
<p>that they not only worship them,</p>
<p>but that every other existing being around them</p>
<p>simply becomes a piece of their own puzzle</p>
<p>and pursuit of their own lordship</p>
<p>and their own satisfaction.</p>
<p>They will kill, they will discard,</p>
<p>not because, and I always say this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that tyrants necessarily like killing people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that people&rsquo;s lives pose somewhat</p>
<p>of an indifference to them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re indifferent to people&rsquo;s existence.</p>
<p>And so you become either an object for or against me.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re willing to discard children,</p>
<p>discard people, discard the rights of others</p>
<p>because they ultimately have chosen</p>
<p>that the greatest pursuit of themselves</p>
<p>is the maximum position of power</p>
<p>and a place to where they can fulfill what they want to</p>
<p>of themselves without any limits.</p>
<p>And everyone else becomes either a threat</p>
<p>or an opportunity in that regard.</p>
<p>So we can be devils.</p>
<p>We can be angelic-like.</p>
<p>We can be animals.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re somewhere on that spectrum.</p>
<p>And every moment contains a set of choices you can make.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Every single moment contains a set of choices.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the intentionality comes in, right?</p>
<p>So the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him,</p>
<p>says that I saw a person strolling in paradise</p>
<p>because he removed something harmful from the road.</p>
<p>He tells us about a woman</p>
<p>that lived a life in prostitution,</p>
<p>but that repented to God when she was thirsty one day</p>
<p>and she saw a dog that was also thirsty.</p>
<p>And she said that I was thirsty and God gave me water,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m gonna choose to give water to that thirsty dog.</p>
<p>And God enters her into paradise as a result of that.</p>
<p>Sometimes the small moments with a small sincere deed</p>
<p>can have a huge impact on a person&rsquo;s trajectory.</p>
<p>So every moment is a moment of choices.</p>
<p>And when we choose belief, righteousness,</p>
<p>a pursuit of something greater,</p>
<p>then we find ways to turn things</p>
<p>that are otherwise mundane into miraculous acts, right?</p>
<p>Where we can choose God over ourselves</p>
<p>and in the process choose a better fate for ourselves.</p>
<p>How difficult is the process of knowing,</p>
<p>understanding what is the righteous action,</p>
<p>of knowing what it means to be a good man or a good woman?</p>
<p>Well, the truth has consequences.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t seek out the truth</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re willing to abide by what you find.</p>
<p>So a lot of people want to mold their journey</p>
<p>in accordance with a predetermined pursuit</p>
<p>that they already have.</p>
<p>And so when they approach religion,</p>
<p>they approach it like another product.</p>
<p>There was an article that was actually written by a rabbi.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken about this in several sermons.</p>
<p>It was called The Allure of Narcissistic Spirituality.</p>
<p>The Allure of Narcissistic Spirituality,</p>
<p>where he talks about how religion becomes</p>
<p>just another product of your own self adoration and worship</p>
<p>to where you only approach religion</p>
<p>to the extent that it gives you</p>
<p>more happiness in the worldly sense.</p>
<p>You only approach of it what is therapeutic.</p>
<p>So it becomes just as secular in its nature</p>
<p>as any other practice of meditation</p>
<p>or whatever it may be or some other product.</p>
<p>And it kind of mentions how he took that</p>
<p>from a person that is praying in a temple</p>
<p>and a guy walks into the temple and bumps into him</p>
<p>and then he curses the guy out.</p>
<p>So he didn&rsquo;t see his behavior towards that person</p>
<p>as part of his trajectory of worship.</p>
<p>He just saw his being godly</p>
<p>as the worship that he was engaged in.</p>
<p>The truth has consequences.</p>
<p>The truth has circumstances that are required of you,</p>
<p>actions that are required of you</p>
<p>that may be somewhat inconvenient.</p>
<p>So you have to be willing to engage</p>
<p>in a sincere pursuit of truth</p>
<p>and look for truth for what it is</p>
<p>and not simply look for comfort and convenience.</p>
<p>And when you engage in that journey</p>
<p>of wanting to know,</p>
<p>you have to engage it thoroughly and sincerely</p>
<p>and try your best to remove any bias.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what makes the religion of Islam</p>
<p>such a phenomenon for people</p>
<p>that with all the Islamophobia and the bigotry towards it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still the fastest growing religion in the United States</p>
<p>and the fastest growing religion in the world.</p>
<p>And no, that&rsquo;s not all birth rate.</p>
<p>Yeah, we have a lot of kids.</p>
<p>But many people, you met someone</p>
<p>just before we started this interview.</p>
<p>Many people, in fact, in a post 9-11 world</p>
<p>saw what they saw of Islam in the media.</p>
<p>And they actually went and checked out copies of the Quran</p>
<p>and started to read about the religion</p>
<p>and in their sincere pursuit of truth</p>
<p>ended up embracing a religion</p>
<p>that they believed was the greatest source</p>
<p>of destruction in the world.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s the greatest source of peace for them</p>
<p>and their own existence and their own lives.</p>
<p>And so you have to be willing to engage</p>
<p>in a sincere pursuit of wanting to know</p>
<p>and then be willing to engage in sincere commitment</p>
<p>after you know, otherwise the heart rusts.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a process in the Quran talks about this</p>
<p>of making the heart like fertile soil towards truth.</p>
<p>So you have a sincere pursuit,</p>
<p>but then at some point, if you come to know</p>
<p>and then you ignore what you come to know,</p>
<p>then the heart rusts and it becomes harder to recognize</p>
<p>it the second time around and the third time around.</p>
<p>And so when people come to me and they say,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m looking for something,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for God, I&rsquo;m looking for my purpose.</p>
<p>The first thing I tell them as I say, listen,</p>
<p>what you need to do is if you&rsquo;re really looking for God</p>
<p>and you believe in God, and there are often people</p>
<p>that say, I believe in God,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know where to go with this, right?</p>
<p>I know that there&rsquo;s something greater.</p>
<p>And in Islam, we call that the fitra,</p>
<p>a natural disposition towards the belief</p>
<p>in the existence of God.</p>
<p>But where do I go from here?</p>
<p>You know, what do I do now?</p>
<p>And I say, the first thing you need to do is</p>
<p>you need to sincerely say, oh God, guide me to the truth.</p>
<p>Call upon God sincerely, say I&rsquo;m calling upon you alone</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m asking you to guide me to the truth.</p>
<p>Show me what it is, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the heart function.</p>
<p>Then you need to actually investigate</p>
<p>and try to suspend bias, right?</p>
<p>Investigate the world&rsquo;s religions,</p>
<p>investigate the claims to truth,</p>
<p>investigate, use rational inquiry to the extent</p>
<p>that the heart becomes satisfied and suspend bias</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be surprised.</p>
<p>And so for a lot of people, when they come to me</p>
<p>and they say, you know, this, this, this about Islam,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, look, if you&rsquo;re just gonna talk to me</p>
<p>about what you&rsquo;ve seen of Islam in the media,</p>
<p>if you were serious about it, you know,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re serious about it, then you&rsquo;re not simply</p>
<p>going to be satisfied with the highly edited images</p>
<p>and distorted facts that come towards you</p>
<p>about this religion, right?</p>
<p>What are you looking for, right?</p>
<p>Are you looking for a scapegoat?</p>
<p>Islam poses a threat to many people, right?</p>
<p>Are you looking for a scapegoat?</p>
<p>Are you looking for the big, bad, scary foreign enemy?</p>
<p>Or are you looking at a religion</p>
<p>that one fourth of the world adheres to?</p>
<p>And if one fourth of us were bad,</p>
<p>the world would not exist, right?</p>
<p>So are you looking towards this religion</p>
<p>that one fourth of the world adheres to?</p>
<p>Are you going to read about the Prophet Muhammad,</p>
<p>peace be upon him?</p>
<p>Are you going to read the Quran yourself?</p>
<p>Are you going to investigate for yourself</p>
<p>what it is that this faith has to offer</p>
<p>and find in it a great sense of wisdom,</p>
<p>a great sense of beauty, a great sense of truth?</p>
<p>And I think that for a lot of people,</p>
<p>they find that Islam has such a beautiful combination</p>
<p>of the intellectual proofs,</p>
<p>as well as the spiritual experiences</p>
<p>that often combine what people seek</p>
<p>in the Western and the Eastern religion.</p>
<p>So I had an interesting two weeks.</p>
<p>Two weeks in a row, this was August,</p>
<p>two weeks in a row, I had someone who converted to Islam</p>
<p>that went from being, that started off as a Methodist,</p>
<p>went from being a Methodist to being a Buddhist</p>
<p>to being a Muslim.</p>
<p>So two weeks in a row, I had a Methodist-turned-Buddhist-</p>
<p>turned-Muslim.</p>
<p>And I called my Methodist friends.</p>
<p>I have a lot of Methodist pastors in the city</p>
<p>that I work with, and I said, what&rsquo;s going on here, man?</p>
<p>Sending people on to this interesting journey</p>
<p>of Buddhism and then Islam.</p>
<p>But both of them had a very similar story,</p>
<p>which is that they had sought in Buddhism, for example,</p>
<p>some of the meditative practices that are found,</p>
<p>that really Western religion,</p>
<p>which has been dominated by capitalism</p>
<p>and dominated by very material things</p>
<p>and can be very unfulfilling,</p>
<p>they found that in some of the Eastern philosophies</p>
<p>and the meditative practices.</p>
<p>And then they came to Islam,</p>
<p>and it combined their belief in sort of the Abrahamic way.</p>
<p>It merged their belief in one God and the prophets,</p>
<p>like Abraham and Moses and Jesus, peace be upon them all,</p>
<p>with a deep tradition of meditative practices,</p>
<p>of consciousness, of connection to God on a regular basis.</p>
<p>And they found that to be very fulfilling,</p>
<p>both intellectually and spiritually.</p>
<p>And so I was like, that&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>two people in two weeks that went through that journey.</p>
<p>So I think Islam is very wholesome, comprehensive,</p>
<p>when people actually approach it with humility</p>
<p>and appreciate what it has to offer.</p>
<p>As you mentioned, in the minds of some Americans,</p>
<p>after 9-11, the religion of Islam was associated with,</p>
<p>maybe you could say evil in the world,</p>
<p>maybe you can say terrorism.</p>
<p>How can you respond to this association?</p>
<p>How does it make you feel, first of all,</p>
<p>as a devout Muslim yourself?</p>
<p>And how can you overcome it personally?</p>
<p>How can you overcome it as a community</p>
<p>and as a religious leader?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, because 9-11 now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking over 21 years ago.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s people born after 9-11.</p>
<p>You get to talk to them all the time.</p>
<p>Yeah, so when I&rsquo;m talking to young Muslims,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about post-9-11, post-9-11,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, I was born in 2005,</p>
<p>what are you talking about, post-9-11?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, I remember being a teenager,</p>
<p>I remember being in high school when this happened, right?</p>
<p>So a lot of us that experience 9-11 as high schoolers</p>
<p>or as college students and remember distinctly</p>
<p>what it was like to be a Muslim pre-9-11 and post-9-11,</p>
<p>we can relate to that experience</p>
<p>and we could identify that juncture very clearly</p>
<p>and talk about it and speak to the change</p>
<p>in the perceptions of Islam that happened here</p>
<p>in the United States and around the world.</p>
<p>But a lot of young people are born into that reality</p>
<p>and are experiencing the aftermath of it.</p>
<p>And unfortunately have to deal with the bigotry</p>
<p>that has not just taken greater shape</p>
<p>in media constructions of Islam, but also policies, right?</p>
<p>A lot of the civil liberties of the Muslim community</p>
<p>were taken away from us.</p>
<p>You read about the Patriot Act,</p>
<p>you read about the securitization of the Muslim community</p>
<p>and some of the unfair practices</p>
<p>that have been engaged by the Bush administration,</p>
<p>the Obama administration, the Trump administration</p>
<p>and continue into the Biden administration,</p>
<p>international Islamophobia.</p>
<p>And so the hatred of Muslims and the bigotry</p>
<p>that is wielded against Muslims on the basis of this idea</p>
<p>that we are a barbaric people,</p>
<p>not ascribed to a religion of hate and violence,</p>
<p>has had immediate consequences for us</p>
<p>no matter where we are in terms of our age</p>
<p>and in terms of our experience.</p>
<p>We have dealt with that in different ways.</p>
<p>Now, the association of Islam to terrorism</p>
<p>is a lazy association.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one that ignores both the history of violence</p>
<p>as well as its everyday occurrence.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re good for how many mass shootings a year?</p>
<p>When&rsquo;s the last time you heard of a Muslim</p>
<p>carrying out a mass shooting in America, right?</p>
<p>How many of those mass shootings,</p>
<p>if you were to scrub the social media,</p>
<p>what, 400, 500 mass shootings a year?</p>
<p>If you were to scrub the social media</p>
<p>of some of those that carried out those shootings.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re good for one or two idiots a year, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unfortunate that you&rsquo;re gonna have people</p>
<p>that carry out despicable acts of violence.</p>
<p>But when we as Muslims hear someone in the media say,</p>
<p>terrorism has been ruled out as a possibility,</p>
<p>while the blood is still on the floor of that Walmart,</p>
<p>we already know that the police chief just said</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t a Muslim, don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>You know, that wasn&rsquo;t an Al-Qaeda guy or an ISIS guy.</p>
<p>It was one of our own, right?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s become frankly ridiculous</p>
<p>because the association of violence with Islam</p>
<p>is one that is used to actually carry out acts of violence</p>
<p>against Muslims worldwide.</p>
<p>It justifies bad policy towards Muslims worldwide</p>
<p>and in the United States.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just factually so lazy.</p>
<p>There was a study just about how the media</p>
<p>gives more attention to acts of violence done by Muslims</p>
<p>and immediately stamps it with Islam</p>
<p>up to 300% more than it will</p>
<p>with another act of violence carried out</p>
<p>in the name of anything else.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t hear about the acts of violence</p>
<p>that are carried out by others.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t hear about the religion of the perpetrators.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t associate terrorism with actions,</p>
<p>frankly, of state terrorism.</p>
<p>You know, when governments launch chemical attacks</p>
<p>or drone weddings and do so</p>
<p>while explicitly dehumanizing the people,</p>
<p>just because they do so with the government apparatus</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make it any less terroristic</p>
<p>than if it&rsquo;s a lone person that goes out</p>
<p>and commits an act of violence</p>
<p>trying to achieve a political goal.</p>
<p>So the association is lazy, historically speaking.</p>
<p>The Crusades, I grew up in Louisiana.</p>
<p>I saw Klan rallies, Ku Klux Klan rallies my whole life.</p>
<p>And people said, well, that&rsquo;s a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Well, guess what?</p>
<p>We see many semblances, many acts that are carried out</p>
<p>with the same vitriol that was generated</p>
<p>by the Ku Klux Klan.</p>
<p>We have people standing in front of our mosques</p>
<p>that belong to right-wing hate militias</p>
<p>carrying AR-15s talking about wanting</p>
<p>to inflict harm on Muslims.</p>
<p>I have been to Christchurch, New Zealand</p>
<p>and buried the victims of a white supremacist terrorist</p>
<p>who was inspired by the political rhetoric</p>
<p>here in the United States, in his own words,</p>
<p>in his manifesto, to go and kill 50 innocent people</p>
<p>in Christchurch, New Zealand,</p>
<p>one of the most peaceful cities in the world.</p>
<p>And by the way, Lex, I mean, it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Like with Christchurch, the man wanted,</p>
<p>and I won&rsquo;t even say his name,</p>
<p>but his next target after the two mosques,</p>
<p>had he not been stopped, was to go to a Muslim daycare.</p>
<p>So what drives someone to dehumanize people</p>
<p>to that extent that he was willing to go to a daycare</p>
<p>and murder a bunch of kids because he saw them</p>
<p>as a demographic threat to civilization?</p>
<p>So Muslims are terrorized</p>
<p>because they are falsely depicted as terrorists.</p>
<p>Muslims suffer domestically and globally</p>
<p>because of this false association.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lazy association.</p>
<p>And when someone comes around and says,</p>
<p>well, fine, not all Muslims are terrorists,</p>
<p>but all terrorists are Muslims,</p>
<p>I say that you clearly don&rsquo;t read statistics.</p>
<p>Whether we&rsquo;re talking about the 20th century,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a student of history,</p>
<p>and I believe you are as well,</p>
<p>all the isms, World War I, World War II,</p>
<p>had nothing to do with religion,</p>
<p>certainly had nothing to do with Islam,</p>
<p>fascism, Soviet atheism, right?</p>
<p>Many of these systems where people were murdered</p>
<p>in the millions, Nazism, the Holocaust, Rwanda, Cambodia,</p>
<p>I can go on and on.</p>
<p>The Rohingya today,</p>
<p>the greatest atrocity towards the Uyghurs.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s Islam fit in all of this?</p>
<p>People do horrible things.</p>
<p>They stamp it with religion at times.</p>
<p>But the only group of people that seem to suffer</p>
<p>after an act of violence is committed are Muslims,</p>
<p>because any act of violence that is committed by a Muslim</p>
<p>will immediately be blamed on Islam,</p>
<p>and two billion people will have to carry the burden</p>
<p>of the act of a single perpetrator.</p>
<p>And just to reiterate, in case the numbers are not known,</p>
<p>you mentioned Christchurch.</p>
<p>Those are two mosque shootings with 51 people killed</p>
<p>and 48 were injured in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hate manifesting itself</p>
<p>and then actual human suffering and destruction.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Is there similarities between anti-Semitism</p>
<p>and anti-Muslim hate?</p>
<p>So is there something deeper to say</p>
<p>about hate in general here</p>
<p>that is beyond just particularly hate towards Muslims?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Look, in Pittsburgh, the synagogue shooting,</p>
<p>the perpetrator particularly targeted that synagogue</p>
<p>because-</p>
<p>Tree of Life Synagogue.</p>
<p>Tree of Life Synagogue.</p>
<p>11 killed, six wounded in 2018.</p>
<p>Because he believed that they were taking in Syrian refugees</p>
<p>or supporting Syrian Muslim refugees.</p>
<p>You think about that.</p>
<p>The San Diego synagogue shooting</p>
<p>that took place shortly after,</p>
<p>he went to a mosque and then he went to a synagogue.</p>
<p>Look, the idea of scapegoating minority populations</p>
<p>and attributing to them a disproportionate sense of power</p>
<p>and a nefarious element where they can&rsquo;t be trusted.</p>
<p>And unless we wipe them out,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re going to wipe us out.</p>
<p>Underlies many of the bigotries that exist.</p>
<p>I mean, look, after Trump announced his Muslim ban,</p>
<p>there was a shooting in Canada,</p>
<p>an attack in Canada on a mosque in Quebec</p>
<p>where six people were killed.</p>
<p>The shooter explicitly said</p>
<p>that the reason why he went to that mosque in Quebec</p>
<p>and shot dead six Muslim worshipers</p>
<p>was because he was afraid that because of the ban</p>
<p>on Syrian refugees in the United States,</p>
<p>they would come to Canada</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t want them to feel welcomed in Canada.</p>
<p>So there is a connection.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s when you are able</p>
<p>to dehumanize large groups of people</p>
<p>and attribute a nefarious element to them,</p>
<p>then unfortunately in a world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s becoming more and more polarized</p>
<p>where people are able to construct their entire worldviews</p>
<p>based on an algorithm that their social media caters to,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have some of these attacks happen</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>an unfortunate connection between them.</p>
<p>So what I tell people is that,</p>
<p>I think with all of these people</p>
<p>that shoot up synagogues and shoot up mosques,</p>
<p>and even before that, actually,</p>
<p>the Charleston, South Carolina shooting at an AME church</p>
<p>you know, when he went there,</p>
<p>he actually said that before he murdered nine worshipers</p>
<p>in that church, he was taken aback</p>
<p>by how nice they were to him.</p>
<p>He sat there for two hours before he turned a gun</p>
<p>on many people who were over the age of 80 years old</p>
<p>and murdered them in cold blood.</p>
<p>So this is what I talk about when I say that</p>
<p>as human beings, we have the propensity, unfortunately,</p>
<p>to become worse than devils,</p>
<p>or we can choose to be angelic</p>
<p>when we choose worship and righteousness over ourselves.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a spiritual crisis as well,</p>
<p>and a crisis of meaning and emptiness</p>
<p>where I think people are willing to inflict great pain</p>
<p>on others when they can&rsquo;t make sense of the pain</p>
<p>in their own lives.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to try to figure out together with you</p>
<p>sort of a way out to try to decrease</p>
<p>the amount of hate in the world,</p>
<p>but maybe it&rsquo;s useful to talk about the BBC documentary</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s kind of interesting that people should check out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called United States of Hate, Muslims Under Attack,</p>
<p>and you appear in that.</p>
<p>You have conversations with people who are anti-Muslim</p>
<p>and I believe most of it takes place here in Dallas.</p>
<p>And can you just tell me about this little documentary</p>
<p>about that time, what it was like to interact?</p>
<p>What was the group in the documentary</p>
<p>and what was like to interact with them?</p>
<p>You know, in the very beginning of the rise of,</p>
<p>at that time actually, Ted Cruz, Donald Trump,</p>
<p>like when Islamophobia was at the center</p>
<p>of many of the presidential candidates&rsquo; campaigns</p>
<p>at the time.</p>
<p>This must have been 2015.</p>
<p>Yes, 2015.</p>
<p>The mayor of Irving at the time, Beth Van Dyne,</p>
<p>who is now a congresswoman, had put out the idea</p>
<p>that Muslims were operating a Sharia court in Irving, Texas.</p>
<p>And suddenly there was a hysteria,</p>
<p>because again, there&rsquo;s the idea that Muslims are here</p>
<p>to dominate, Muslims are here to overthrow</p>
<p>everything that you have in the United States.</p>
<p>There was hysteria here.</p>
<p>And it was unfortunate because what it unleashed,</p>
<p>you know, especially with the national discourse</p>
<p>at the time, again, the presidential campaign,</p>
<p>you know, Donald Trump says, I think Islam hates us.</p>
<p>When he uses those words, I think Islam hates us.</p>
<p>When Ted Cruz suggests that Muslim neighborhoods</p>
<p>could be patrolled or should be patrolled.</p>
<p>And then you have the Irving mayor saying</p>
<p>that one of the most populated cities</p>
<p>with Muslims in America, they&rsquo;re operating</p>
<p>under an alternative legal, an alternate legal system.</p>
<p>And funny enough, the year before that,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;d come to the mosque and she praised</p>
<p>the diversity of Irving.</p>
<p>And she was talking about how welcome she felt</p>
<p>in the mosque, and the next thing we know,</p>
<p>you have these crazy white supremacist groups,</p>
<p>openly white supremacists that affiliate themselves</p>
<p>with the Klan and others protesting regularly</p>
<p>in front of our mosques with their AR-15s</p>
<p>and telling people to go back home.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m from New Orleans.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not planning to move back to New Orleans.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m home, we&rsquo;re home, we&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re staying put.</p>
<p>And we refuse to be intimidated.</p>
<p>But then when the Syrian refugee crisis</p>
<p>is unfolding as well, Dallas has been</p>
<p>one of the more popular destinations, if you will.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about it like a vacation destination,</p>
<p>but where a lot of refugees have come to</p>
<p>just because of the infrastructure that we have</p>
<p>set up here to receive refugees.</p>
<p>And so that hysteria was an unfortunate,</p>
<p>perfect combustion of the national discourse</p>
<p>with the local discourse with the incoming refugees.</p>
<p>And we would do all sorts of welcome refugee events.</p>
<p>And we do that, you know, and we don&rsquo;t only do that</p>
<p>for Muslim refugees, by the way.</p>
<p>There are refugees from other parts of the world as well.</p>
<p>But we would host events at our mosques, you know,</p>
<p>to welcome refugees, to help integrate them</p>
<p>into the community, to do things for them.</p>
<p>So you have these armed protests happening, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s horrible because think about the trauma</p>
<p>to the children that are hearing about Tree of Life</p>
<p>and hearing about some of these other incidents</p>
<p>that are unfolding.</p>
<p>And really one of the first communities that was targeted</p>
<p>was the Sikh community in Madison.</p>
<p>That was one of the first shootings.</p>
<p>And then the AME church, Charleston.</p>
<p>And then you just had tons of places of worship</p>
<p>being targeted, right?</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re seeing this unfold and then they&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>these guns in front of their mosques.</p>
<p>And the result to many is, well,</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t want to get shot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to go to the mosque.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to have this happen to me.</p>
<p>So, you know, when BBC reached out and said,</p>
<p>we want to do a documentary about this.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Dallas was the only place in America</p>
<p>where you had regular armed groups in front of our mosques.</p>
<p>It was happening around the country infrequently,</p>
<p>but here it was happening every week.</p>
<p>So the BBC reached out and said, we want to interview you.</p>
<p>And he said, we&rsquo;ve got this idea.</p>
<p>We want to put you, we want to take you to a park</p>
<p>and have you meet one of the protesters</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been wielding his gun outside your mosque</p>
<p>and talk to him.</p>
<p>And it was really interesting because they&rsquo;d interviewed him</p>
<p>before meeting me.</p>
<p>And the things that he was able to utter before meeting me</p>
<p>and before meeting Syrian refugees was just awful.</p>
<p>I mean, the most dehumanizing rhetoric that you can imagine.</p>
<p>But then at the park, he meets me, talks to me.</p>
<p>He meets a Syrian refugee family.</p>
<p>One of the girls whose leg had been blown off</p>
<p>in an airstrike.</p>
<p>And he said, I feel like an idiot.</p>
<p>I mean, he expressed all sorts of regret and was teary eyed</p>
<p>that he could dehumanize people the way that he was.</p>
<p>And so my whole thing was and is come inside the mosque,</p>
<p>put your gun down, disarm yourself and learn.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll be surprised what you&rsquo;ll walk away with.</p>
<p>And only took one meeting with him</p>
<p>to completely shift his worldview at the time,</p>
<p>which was made up of heroes and villains.</p>
<p>The Muslims, unfortunately being the villains</p>
<p>that had to be wiped off the face of the earth</p>
<p>so that the earth could continue.</p>
<p>That was an interesting documentary</p>
<p>and it was an interesting social experiment.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it feel like to have all of these people</p>
<p>that hate you and others in the community,</p>
<p>people you love with guns, threatening violence,</p>
<p>basically that don&rsquo;t want you here</p>
<p>in this country, on this earth?</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s not nice, it&rsquo;s not great.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s definitely a challenge,</p>
<p>but look, there are challenges that we face as Muslims,</p>
<p>being in the United States, being in a hostile climate,</p>
<p>and there are different types of challenges.</p>
<p>And I think what we&rsquo;ve had to do as a Muslim community</p>
<p>is see beyond both the guns and the roses</p>
<p>and think about who we are first.</p>
<p>Because frankly, Islamophobia exists in different forms</p>
<p>and from different sides.</p>
<p>And we try to use this as an opportunity</p>
<p>to instill in our young people,</p>
<p>not just a sense of belonging, but a sense of purpose.</p>
<p>Do not be intimidated, and in fact,</p>
<p>show them the best of your Islam.</p>
<p>Live your life, because at the end of the day,</p>
<p>the goal that is sought through intimidation is silence.</p>
<p>And so we have to carry ourselves as proud American Muslims.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to impress anyone.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t need to relinquish an iota of our faith</p>
<p>to coexist with anyone.</p>
<p>We are satisfied with who we are.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see a contradiction.</p>
<p>Between our place of residence and our religion,</p>
<p>our nationality, our religion,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t see that as a problem, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something for them to work out,</p>
<p>not for you to work out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I would tell young Muslims.</p>
<p>That continue to live your faith fully</p>
<p>and demonstrate the beauty of it.</p>
<p>And do not let the ugliness of the world consume you.</p>
<p>But for those young Muslims, what would you say</p>
<p>how they should feel towards the people that hate them?</p>
<p>The natural human, there&rsquo;s a desire still to have anger,</p>
<p>to have resentment, to have hate back</p>
<p>at the people that hate you.</p>
<p>The Quran says,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Respond to that which is evil with that which is better.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And you will find that sometimes</p>
<p>your enemy will become your close friend.</p>
<p>So respond with that which is better.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean be passive.</p>
<p>Sometimes there needs to be a demonstration of strength.</p>
<p>Sometimes there needs to be a demonstration</p>
<p>of ignoring a people altogether.</p>
<p>But ultimately you can&rsquo;t let the way people treat you</p>
<p>shape who you&rsquo;re going to be in the world.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why I say we have to look beyond the guns</p>
<p>and the roses.</p>
<p>We have to look beyond the hostility of our enemies</p>
<p>and the temporary and opportunistic embrace</p>
<p>of some of those who claim to be our allies</p>
<p>and be us and treat the world</p>
<p>and treat the people of this world</p>
<p>in accordance with your standards, not with theirs.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t teach them, you know,</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t let them teach you bad character.</p>
<p>You teach them good character.</p>
<p>So live your life and live your faith beautifully</p>
<p>and let people see the beauty of it through your being</p>
<p>and do not let their ugliness consume you.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>sometimes you got to give people room</p>
<p>to express frustration,</p>
<p>to say that this is unacceptable,</p>
<p>to have demonstrations of strength.</p>
<p>And I think that those things</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to all contradict each other.</p>
<p>Yeah, what do you think about,</p>
<p>these kinds of protests are not allowed</p>
<p>in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>What do you think about one of the most,</p>
<p>to you directly, personally painful manifestations</p>
<p>of the First Amendment,</p>
<p>of the people&rsquo;s right to freedom of speech</p>
<p>and to protest, to say hateful things?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been at the receiving end of the worst of it.</p>
<p>What do you feel about this particular freedom</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s at the core of the founding of this country?</p>
<p>Look, I think that you have to take it away from the text</p>
<p>and look at it within reality.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be real.</p>
<p>Would Muslims be able to protest in front of churches</p>
<p>with guns on a weekly basis in this country?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a deep, pragmatically speaking,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a hypocrisy to what&rsquo;s allowed or not.</p>
<p>Major hypocrisy, major hypocrisy.</p>
<p>See, free speech is an ideal that is weaponized</p>
<p>against the Muslim community</p>
<p>and against other communities in such a hypocritical way.</p>
<p>You know, you take, for example, some countries in Europe,</p>
<p>you know, let&rsquo;s kind of move away from this</p>
<p>and look at the hypocrisy of a place like France</p>
<p>where the caricaturing and the portrayal</p>
<p>of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him,</p>
<p>in derogatory ways will be used</p>
<p>as the hallmark of free speech.</p>
<p>But Muslims that will caricature Macron</p>
<p>or challenge some of the values of France,</p>
<p>the supposed enshrined values of France,</p>
<p>will end up in prison and end up deported.</p>
<p>And so here in the United States, there&rsquo;s a great hypocrisy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that places of worship</p>
<p>should have armed protesters in front of them.</p>
<p>I think that that poses a security risk.</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s not okay.</p>
<p>And I think that free speech is weaponized</p>
<p>against the Muslim community</p>
<p>and often is held up as this great value,</p>
<p>but really to attain very lowly things</p>
<p>and is often to our detriment.</p>
<p>Yeah, just even watching that documentary,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to put into words,</p>
<p>but somehow that does not capture</p>
<p>what maybe the founders intended.</p>
<p>What I would see is the great ideal</p>
<p>of the freedom of speech.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the solution to that is.</p>
<p>I think taking it outside of words,</p>
<p>maybe that requires a community,</p>
<p>a cultural pressure to be better.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not about the law,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more about just the cultural pressure,</p>
<p>what is and isn&rsquo;t okay.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s something deeply wrong</p>
<p>about that kind of hate.</p>
<p>Yeah, because it was dehumanizing other people</p>
<p>that are here in America, that are Americans.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we have to interrogate</p>
<p>the foundations of our country</p>
<p>when our country is in such turmoil and such chaos.</p>
<p>No country in the world</p>
<p>has the mass shootings that we have.</p>
<p>No country in the world has</p>
<p>some of the polarization that we have.</p>
<p>We have to interrogate that and say</p>
<p>what it is that we&rsquo;re doing wrong that&rsquo;s leading to that.</p>
<p>And I think, again, that it&rsquo;s reaching a point</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s unsustainable.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t do better</p>
<p>and try to solve some of the rifts right now</p>
<p>that exist in our society,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re going to end up in a place</p>
<p>where we may not be able to climb out of this.</p>
<p>What do you think about, you mentioned the Muslim ban,</p>
<p>what do you think about Executive Order 13769</p>
<p>titled Protecting the Nation</p>
<p>from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States?</p>
<p>Often referred to as the Muslim ban</p>
<p>or the Trump travel ban,</p>
<p>it was an executive order by President Trump</p>
<p>that was in effect from January 27th, 2017</p>
<p>for just a few months until March 6th, 2017.</p>
<p>What was this executive order</p>
<p>and what was its effect on your life</p>
<p>and on the life of the Muslim community</p>
<p>and just the life of Americans?</p>
<p>Well, it was disgraceful.</p>
<p>It was a tactic that was used at the time,</p>
<p>very similar to the whole build the wall rhetoric</p>
<p>to play to a particular political sloganeering</p>
<p>and carrying out those types of acts</p>
<p>against the Muslim community.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to face much opposition typically</p>
<p>in any meaningful way that would be politically costly.</p>
<p>When he rolled it out at the time,</p>
<p>there were people in flight on their way</p>
<p>to the United States that were held in airports</p>
<p>around the country, children, elderly people</p>
<p>that were held in these small rooms</p>
<p>and treated awfully before being put back on a plane</p>
<p>and sent to where they were.</p>
<p>There were families that had medical needs</p>
<p>that were never able to come together.</p>
<p>He specifically targeted Muslim countries</p>
<p>to play to that idea of a complete ban of Muslims,</p>
<p>which he knew was not feasible at the time.</p>
<p>Now, personally, Dallas had the largest amount,</p>
<p>the largest number of detainees in the airport.</p>
<p>We have one of the largest airports in America</p>
<p>and we took to the airport</p>
<p>and we stayed there for a few days, stayed overnight.</p>
<p>It was one of the New York Times pictures of the year</p>
<p>when we did our prayer,</p>
<p>because when we had to do our prayer,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t just Muslims that came to the airport.</p>
<p>It was many people that came to the airport</p>
<p>of different faiths that were outraged</p>
<p>by what they had seen.</p>
<p>So when we do our prayer,</p>
<p>there was a protest chant that you pray, we stay.</p>
<p>And so the airport had to make room for us</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re like a thousand people</p>
<p>that need to have our five daily prayers.</p>
<p>So we would do our prayers in the airport.</p>
<p>We waited, we continued until the detainees</p>
<p>were freed, at least temporarily.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some elements of that legislation remained</p>
<p>and it was an ongoing struggle.</p>
<p>But look, what I&rsquo;ll say is that those are some</p>
<p>of the more obvious manifestations of anti-Muslim bigotry.</p>
<p>But again, there&rsquo;s hypocrisy on all sides</p>
<p>of the political aisle here in the United States.</p>
<p>There is Islamophobia of different flavors.</p>
<p>I think even the term Islamophobia can become contentious</p>
<p>because there are people that attack us in different ways</p>
<p>and that might not be as overtly bigoted,</p>
<p>but nonetheless are infringing on our rights</p>
<p>to be full American Muslims.</p>
<p>And Muslims find themselves in a very strange political place</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve got one side that seemingly wants</p>
<p>to annihilate you and another side that only accepts you</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re willing to assimilate,</p>
<p>but no one really allows you to be a full on</p>
<p>American Muslim.</p>
<p>And so Muslims find themselves in a very strange place</p>
<p>right now with all of the political sides,</p>
<p>with the political parties.</p>
<p>Where do Muslims sit politically?</p>
<p>Are they politically engaged in the function</p>
<p>of the United States?</p>
<p>Where do they find themselves politically as a community?</p>
<p>So Muslims find themselves in an awkward place politically.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best way to put it.</p>
<p>We are a religious community.</p>
<p>And so we don&rsquo;t find ourselves welcomed by the left,</p>
<p>which has a hostility towards religion</p>
<p>and most left spaces and most liberal spaces.</p>
<p>In general, because it&rsquo;s kind of religion</p>
<p>has many conservative elements.</p>
<p>Right, so the Muslim community is in its nature</p>
<p>conservative for what that&rsquo;s worth, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a conservative community.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a community that has certain orthodoxies</p>
<p>and practices that would make it disagreeable</p>
<p>in its nature and its practice to many on the left</p>
<p>and many on the right just see us as a group of foreigners</p>
<p>and a threat in that regard.</p>
<p>So we find ourselves in this awkward place.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the presence of sort of the pro-Israel</p>
<p>dominance of both parties.</p>
<p>The foreign policy of both parties is detrimental</p>
<p>to Muslims globally.</p>
<p>The securitization of the Muslim community</p>
<p>and the name of countering violent extremism.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Muslim community has had both Republican</p>
<p>and Democratic administrations just run over its rights.</p>
<p>So we find ourselves kind of in this awkward space, right?</p>
<p>We are a religious community that&rsquo;s also a minority.</p>
<p>The racialization of the Muslim community</p>
<p>sort of robs us of who we are</p>
<p>and how we get to engage them with different platforms</p>
<p>and different peoples around us.</p>
<p>So we find ourselves in a very awkward place.</p>
<p>Is there in general, a lack of representation</p>
<p>in places of power and in politics?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think representation is everything.</p>
<p>I think that representation</p>
<p>can actually be detrimental sometimes</p>
<p>because you can have people that represent you</p>
<p>but that don&rsquo;t actually represent your priorities</p>
<p>as a community, as a faith community.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t wanna be tokenized as a community, right?</p>
<p>We want to be engaged and engage fully as Muslims</p>
<p>and be respected as American Muslims.</p>
<p>You know, I wrote something at the time</p>
<p>actually of Muslim ban.</p>
<p>I wrote an article for CNN called,</p>
<p>I am not your American Muslim.</p>
<p>I am not your American Muslim.</p>
<p>Because we are not a tool of liberals against conservatives</p>
<p>nor are we simply to be made out to be your villain</p>
<p>or your victim.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a people of faith.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re people that have values.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re people that want to see our places of worship thrive.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re people that have something to offer to this country,</p>
<p>to the people around us of good.</p>
<p>But ultimately we want to engage</p>
<p>and be engaged with on the basis of who we actually are</p>
<p>not who you need us to be right now.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been the problem that we&rsquo;ve had.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a lack of representation</p>
<p>as much as a lack of authentic engagement.</p>
<p>You mentioned daily prayer</p>
<p>and if I may, looking at the time, this might be time.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s okay, I would love it</p>
<p>if you allow me to follow along at least in movement</p>
<p>as you pray.</p>
<p>Sure, absolutely.</p>
<p>Thank you for allowing me to join you in that.</p>
<p>Can you maybe describe what does the prayer represent?</p>
<p>What does the prayer represent?</p>
<p>What is the actual practice of prayer like?</p>
<p>What is the process like?</p>
<p>Sure, so prayer is the central pillar, if you will, of Islam.</p>
<p>It is the life of the believer</p>
<p>encapsulated into a very specific act of devotion</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s done at least five times a day.</p>
<p>So there are different types of prayer.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s prayer, there&rsquo;s supplication.</p>
<p>So the five daily prayers are called salah,</p>
<p>which is the obligatory prayers.</p>
<p>And then beyond that, there are voluntary prayers</p>
<p>that are done throughout the day as well.</p>
<p>So you can pray before and after the obligatory prayers</p>
<p>and then there are other times of the day</p>
<p>that you can pray also.</p>
<p>And the best voluntary prayer is at night,</p>
<p>in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the time that you&rsquo;re closest to God.</p>
<p>Sincere, away from the eyes of people,</p>
<p>just in the still of the night.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d pray in a similar way</p>
<p>with the standing and the bowing,</p>
<p>the prostration, reciting the Quran.</p>
<p>And then you have supplication and words of remembrance</p>
<p>that you are to do throughout the day,</p>
<p>between all of that.</p>
<p>So when people say, do you pray five times a day?</p>
<p>I say, at least five times a day.</p>
<p>What are the words of supplication?</p>
<p>Do they come from the Quran</p>
<p>or do they come from your own heart?</p>
<p>Or where do they come from?</p>
<p>So basically you say, Allahu Akbar,</p>
<p>which means I&rsquo;m going to kill you, right?</p>
<p>Or so they say, right?</p>
<p>God is greater.</p>
<p>You start off with that, an expression of God&rsquo;s greatness.</p>
<p>And then you recite the opening chapter of the Quran,</p>
<p>which is known as Al-Fatiha.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first chapter of the Quran.</p>
<p>In the name of God, the most compassionate,</p>
<p>the most merciful, all praises be to God,</p>
<p>the Lord of all the worlds,</p>
<p>most compassionate, most merciful,</p>
<p>master of the day of judgment.</p>
<p>You alone we worship and from you alone we seek help.</p>
<p>Guide us to the straight path,</p>
<p>the path of those who have earned your favor,</p>
<p>not those who have earned your wrath,</p>
<p>nor those who have gone astray.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a translation of the first chapter,</p>
<p>the opening chapter of the Quran,</p>
<p>which is known as Al-Fatiha.</p>
<p>So we recite that in every one of the units of prayer.</p>
<p>And then after that,</p>
<p>we recite something else from the Quran.</p>
<p>So some other portion of the Quran,</p>
<p>and then we say, Allahu Akbar, once again,</p>
<p>God is greater.</p>
<p>We go into bowing and in bowing,</p>
<p>we say, Subhana Rabbi Al-Azim,</p>
<p>Subhana Rabbi Al-Azim,</p>
<p>Subhana Rabbi Al-Azim,</p>
<p>which means glory be to God, the Almighty,</p>
<p>glory be to God, the Almighty,</p>
<p>glory be to God, the Almighty.</p>
<p>And then you come back up and you say,</p>
<p>Samee&rsquo;Allahu liman hamida,</p>
<p>God has heard the one who has praised him.</p>
<p>And then the response is,</p>
<p>Rabbana wa lakal hamd,</p>
<p>and to you, O Lord belongs all praise.</p>
<p>And then we go into prostration</p>
<p>and prostration is at the heart of the prayer.</p>
<p>And it is the most beautiful portion of the prayer.</p>
<p>And it is the most beloved position</p>
<p>for a servant of God</p>
<p>and that which is most pleasing to God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when you say at that point,</p>
<p>Subhana Rabbi Al-A&rsquo;la,</p>
<p>all glory be to God, the Most High,</p>
<p>all glory be to God, the Most High.</p>
<p>So while you put yourself in the lowest position,</p>
<p>you acknowledge God being the Most High.</p>
<p>And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him,</p>
<p>said that the closest that a person is to God</p>
<p>is when they are in prostration.</p>
<p>That is the time that your supplications</p>
<p>are most precious and beloved.</p>
<p>That is the time that you can cry your heart out.</p>
<p>That is the time that you really feel</p>
<p>a sense of great closeness and devotion to God.</p>
<p>And as I was telling you earlier,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a time that your mind is under your heart</p>
<p>for a change, right?</p>
<p>The only position, physical position</p>
<p>that your mind is actually under your heart.</p>
<p>And you really have a chance to pour your emotions out</p>
<p>and to connect deeply to God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the prayer of all of the Prophets,</p>
<p>Jesus, peace be upon him, is described even biblically</p>
<p>as falling on his face in prayer.</p>
<p>And so it really is, I think,</p>
<p>the most intimate moment that you get with God</p>
<p>and the deepest part of the prayer.</p>
<p>The word masjid, which is mosque in Arabic,</p>
<p>means place of sujood, place of prostration.</p>
<p>So think of the rest of prayer as an introduction</p>
<p>to that particular part of the prayer</p>
<p>where you really immerse yourself.</p>
<p>Not that you shouldn&rsquo;t be immersed</p>
<p>in your prayer throughout,</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re in sujood, when you&rsquo;re in prostration,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re really closest</p>
<p>and most connected to God.</p>
<p>So we do that.</p>
<p>And so some prayers are two units.</p>
<p>Well, the first prayer of the day,</p>
<p>which is before sunrise, the earliest prayer, is two units.</p>
<p>The second prayer, which is around noon, is four units.</p>
<p>And then afternoon, another four units.</p>
<p>And then the sunset prayer is three units.</p>
<p>And then the evening prayer is four units.</p>
<p>So each prayer has a different number of units to it</p>
<p>and some voluntary prayers that surround it.</p>
<p>When you come back up,</p>
<p>you express also a form of greeting towards God</p>
<p>and channeling your prayers and your blessings towards God.</p>
<p>You reiterate the shahadah,</p>
<p>which is the first pillar of Islam.</p>
<p>I testify that there&rsquo;s only one God</p>
<p>and that Muhammad is his servant and messenger.</p>
<p>And then you read what&rsquo;s called salah ibrahimiya,</p>
<p>which is the Abrahamic prayer.</p>
<p>So you send peace and blessings upon Muhammad and his family</p>
<p>and Abraham and his family.</p>
<p>Abraham, peace be upon him,</p>
<p>is really at the core of this religion.</p>
<p>And so at the prayer, at the end of the prayer,</p>
<p>you send peace and blessings and prayers upon, again,</p>
<p>both Muhammad and his family and Abraham and his family.</p>
<p>And then you have another chance</p>
<p>to make some of your own personal prayers.</p>
<p>And then you say,</p>
<p>As-salamu alaykum wa rahmatullah.</p>
<p>Peace be on to you and the mercy of God.</p>
<p>To your right.</p>
<p>Peace be on to you and the mercy of God.</p>
<p>To your left.</p>
<p>And that means everything and everyone to your right,</p>
<p>everyone and everything to your left.</p>
<p>So you imagine a congregation,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in worship, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sending that to the angels</p>
<p>and the human beings next to you,</p>
<p>your fellow worshipers next to you.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll even say,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll seek forgiveness from God afterwards.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s supplications that surround the prayer.</p>
<p>And you will say,</p>
<p>Allahumma anta salam wa minka salam.</p>
<p>That, oh Allah, oh God,</p>
<p>you are peace and from you is peace.</p>
<p>And to you belongs all glory and all praise.</p>
<p>Almost to say that you received something in this prayer,</p>
<p>that you receive a great sense of inner peace.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re spreading that, right?</p>
<p>So as it really comes into you,</p>
<p>then you can give to the world around you</p>
<p>what you generate in your own heart.</p>
<p>And in prayer, you generate a great sense of tranquility,</p>
<p>a great sense of peace.</p>
<p>The Quran says,</p>
<p>Verily in the remembrance of God do hearts find</p>
<p>contentment.</p>
<p>And prayer is an exercise in the remembrance of God.</p>
<p>That is, again, obligatory five times a day,</p>
<p>no matter where you are.</p>
<p>So if-</p>
<p>Anywhere in the world,</p>
<p>anywhere you find yourself in your life,</p>
<p>in different life circumstances, anywhere.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So outside a coffee shop in the grass,</p>
<p>outside of the coffee shop.</p>
<p>As we did a few days ago.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So anywhere at all.</p>
<p>And that means-</p>
<p>Airports included.</p>
<p>Given the context of our previous conversation</p>
<p>of hatred towards people of Muslim faith,</p>
<p>that means you probably,</p>
<p>through the practice of prayer,</p>
<p>it attracts people that hate-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve attracted curiosity.</p>
<p>Curiosity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve attracted hate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had people walk up to me like,</p>
<p>hey man, you okay?</p>
<p>You know, in the airport.</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>So most probably is conversations of curiosity</p>
<p>and the opportunity to actually talk about the values</p>
<p>that you represent.</p>
<p>I try to make it a point to tell people</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m about to pray in front of them.</p>
<p>So like, you know, in the airport,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say for example,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go to the corner next to a gate.</p>
<p>And if there are people sitting there like,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;m about to engage in a prayer,</p>
<p>I hope you don&rsquo;t mind.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll really appreciate the courtesy most of the time.</p>
<p>But no, I mean,</p>
<p>when those five times come in</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re kind of windows, right?</p>
<p>We have to pray.</p>
<p>And that means at work.</p>
<p>That means at school.</p>
<p>That means when you&rsquo;re traveling.</p>
<p>Although there&rsquo;s some concessions</p>
<p>that allow you to combine prayers</p>
<p>at certain times when you&rsquo;re traveling, for example.</p>
<p>But even then you&rsquo;re gonna have to pray.</p>
<p>And I think that what that does</p>
<p>to bring you back to God,</p>
<p>no matter what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually, you know,</p>
<p>you think of it this way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in a meeting,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re engaged in something,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really stressed out.</p>
<p>And you also have the ablution before the prayer</p>
<p>where you wash up,</p>
<p>wash your face,</p>
<p>wash your limbs and engage in prayer.</p>
<p>What it does for you in anchoring you</p>
<p>in something more meaningful</p>
<p>when you are in the turmoil of a lot of times,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s not so meaningful is incredible.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a gift from God and it is an obligation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that we have to do as Muslims.</p>
<p>But if you actually learn its essence,</p>
<p>then it can feel more like a joy</p>
<p>than it is an obligation.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re called to at night,</p>
<p>especially again,</p>
<p>the night prayer is a big part of who we are as Muslims.</p>
<p>Waking up in the last part of the night,</p>
<p>the prophet Muhammad peace be upon him</p>
<p>said that the best prayer and the best fasting</p>
<p>was of that of David peace be upon him.</p>
<p>So we think of David,</p>
<p>the prophet David,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a prophet in Islam as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll ask me about the whole concept</p>
<p>of prophethood.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re hearing Abraham and David and others, right?</p>
<p>So David peace be upon him,</p>
<p>he said that David used to fast every other day</p>
<p>and he used to pray the last third of the night.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d stand up and pray in the last third of the night.</p>
<p>So fasting is a big part of who we are</p>
<p>and praying in the last third of the night,</p>
<p>meaning before that early morning prayer,</p>
<p>waking up if you can at 4 a.m, 4.30 a.m, 5 a.m</p>
<p>and praying even for a few minutes</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something in the serenity of the night</p>
<p>that can unlock in you a sense of inner joy and peace</p>
<p>that nothing else in the world can give you.</p>
<p>And again, that pulls you away</p>
<p>from all the turmoil of day-to-day life.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s little things or if it&rsquo;s big things,</p>
<p>it just pulls you out of it</p>
<p>to remember what is more important in life.</p>
<p>So when we think about access,</p>
<p>in the last third of the night,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re taught that God says,</p>
<p>is there anyone seeking forgiveness that I may forgive them?</p>
<p>Is there anyone seeking refuge that I may grant it to them?</p>
<p>Is there anyone asking for anything</p>
<p>that I may give it to them?</p>
<p>So whatever you&rsquo;re calling upon him with at that time,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s responding to you in a way that befits him.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s closeness as well.</p>
<p>And you would think that you sleep less,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re probably more cranky,</p>
<p>but the happiest people in the world</p>
<p>are the people that stand up</p>
<p>in that last third of the night and pray.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a deeply meditative contemplative aspect</p>
<p>to it that I think probably strengthens your sleep</p>
<p>if anything else, once you return to it.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>See, people underestimate that.</p>
<p>There was a great sage in Islam.</p>
<p>He was asked, he said,</p>
<p>how come the people who pray at night</p>
<p>are the most beautiful of people</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re fresh in the day?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>And he said, because they secluded themselves</p>
<p>with the most merciful and he dressed them in his light.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a beauty that it generates.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re to aspire to that, really.</p>
<p>As believers, that&rsquo;s kind of your highest thing.</p>
<p>Like, don&rsquo;t just pray the five prayers.</p>
<p>If you can pray at night, pray at night</p>
<p>and connect at that time.</p>
<p>Well, a good friend of mine, Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a neuroscientist from Stanford,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a big, he has an amazing podcast called Huberman Lab,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s also a scholar of sleep among many other things.</p>
<p>And so I would love him to,</p>
<p>he probably knows the science on this too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably good science that actually studies</p>
<p>practicing Muslims to see what the benefits to sleep.</p>
<p>I would love to actually see what that says.</p>
<p>We have amazing, I don&rsquo;t want to cut you off,</p>
<p>we have amazing hygiene</p>
<p>because of how much we have to wash up for prayer.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s great for our limbs as well, right?</p>
<p>You know, and that&rsquo;s one of the added benefits, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good for us.</p>
<p>Worship that we do is not torturous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually good for us.</p>
<p>However, the core objective of worship has to remain</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s something you do out of worship</p>
<p>and something you do out of a sense of obligation</p>
<p>and gratitude to God, not because of those things.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m not going to fast because it&rsquo;s good for my health,</p>
<p>but I know it&rsquo;s good for my health to fast.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s pretty cool when you walk into,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll share this with you.</p>
<p>There was a man, he was a scholar from Turkey,</p>
<p>an Islamic scholar from Turkey.</p>
<p>And he had visited us in Dallas and he was 108 years old</p>
<p>and he could still pray, bowing and prostrating.</p>
<p>I mean, his limbs, and you think about that,</p>
<p>like someone at that age still being able to do that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s good for your limbs,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good for your health, good for your gut,</p>
<p>good for your sleep, good for your mind.</p>
<p>I think the mind one is the really one</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really, really, really the big one.</p>
<p>And in the small day-to-day psychological sense</p>
<p>and in the big philosophical sense</p>
<p>of what it means to be a human being.</p>
<p>We should also mention that during the prayer,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;ve explained, you should face Mecca.</p>
<p>So what is Mecca and what&rsquo;s the experience</p>
<p>of visiting Mecca like?</p>
<p>So Mecca is the home that Abraham, peace be upon him,</p>
<p>built along with his son, Ishmael, peace be upon him.</p>
<p>And it gives the Muslims a unified direction of prayer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of at the center geographically of who we are.</p>
<p>And when we pray towards it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that that&rsquo;s the only place</p>
<p>that you can supplicate, turn towards,</p>
<p>but it gives us a unified sense of direction,</p>
<p>it gives us a unified sense of prayer.</p>
<p>So Mecca is our Qibla, it&rsquo;s our place of direction</p>
<p>when we are alive and when we are dead.</p>
<p>So actually we pray facing towards it.</p>
<p>When we die, we are also faced towards it in our graves.</p>
<p>And it kind of gives us that unifying spirit.</p>
<p>So this is the Valley of Beqqa,</p>
<p>also in the Bible spoken about the Valley of Beqqa.</p>
<p>And where other biblical scholars</p>
<p>would also mention Mount Paran.</p>
<p>And it is the place that Adam, in the Quran,</p>
<p>Adam, peace be upon him,</p>
<p>first had a place constructed there as a place of worship</p>
<p>from the angels towards God.</p>
<p>And then when Abraham settles Hagar and Ishmael in Mecca,</p>
<p>they build this house of worship.</p>
<p>And that is where the gushing springs of Zamzam</p>
<p>are mentioned where God sends an angel</p>
<p>to give a miracle to Hagar and Ishmael</p>
<p>that they can sustain themselves from</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re not left in the desert.</p>
<p>So Ishmael being the firstborn son of Abraham</p>
<p>is given a place and there&rsquo;s a story and a history</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to unfold from that place of Mecca.</p>
<p>And then Isaac is born, peace be upon him, 13 years later.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a story and a history that comes from that.</p>
<p>But ultimately Mecca is the center.</p>
<p>Mecca is where we turn towards for prayer.</p>
<p>Mecca is where we perform the pilgrimage,</p>
<p>the Hajj pilgrimage once in our lives,</p>
<p>at least if we can physically and financially,</p>
<p>if we find ourselves capable,</p>
<p>we at least perform the Hajj pilgrimage</p>
<p>once in our lifetimes.</p>
<p>But there are other pilgrimages throughout the year.</p>
<p>You can go at any time of the day, any time of the year,</p>
<p>you will find people that will be performing</p>
<p>the pilgrimage, an iteration of the pilgrimage in Mecca.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an incredible practice.</p>
<p>It really is a place where you feel</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re no longer in this world.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>So we all go there donning what&rsquo;s known as the Ihram garb.</p>
<p>So the men will wear just these white garments,</p>
<p>which are resembling or they resemble the garments</p>
<p>that we will be buried in.</p>
<p>And whether you&rsquo;re a king or a prince or a peasant,</p>
<p>and in classical terms, whoever you are,</p>
<p>whatever distinction you have, you&rsquo;re all the same.</p>
<p>And the women will wear a simple garment as well.</p>
<p>So you go there, you relinquish all of the pretensions</p>
<p>and concerns and superficial barriers and distinctions</p>
<p>that exist in this life.</p>
<p>And we do what&rsquo;s called Tawaf, circle around the Kaaba,</p>
<p>symbolically putting God at the center of our lives.</p>
<p>We do seven rounds between Safa and Marwa,</p>
<p>the two mountains where Hagar, when she once ran</p>
<p>between those two mountains with her baby Ishmael,</p>
<p>looking for water, trusting God was provided for.</p>
<p>We too go between the two mountains of Safa and Marwa</p>
<p>to express that trust in God and to follow in that way.</p>
<p>And these are ultimately, these are the rituals</p>
<p>that Abraham himself engaged in in our tradition</p>
<p>and the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, engaged in.</p>
<p>And so we engage in the exact same rituals</p>
<p>and there are divine wisdoms to them</p>
<p>that we may not even be able to unpack and reflect upon.</p>
<p>But it really is in that place where you find</p>
<p>the most beautiful global expression of Islam.</p>
<p>You see people from all over the world,</p>
<p>people that don&rsquo;t speak the same languages,</p>
<p>people from all sorts of backgrounds,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all doing the exact same thing.</p>
<p>And in a matter of seconds, when the call of prayer comes,</p>
<p>in a matter of seconds, two, three million people</p>
<p>get arranged in perfect rows for prayer, right?</p>
<p>And it just, it looks like this perfect optical,</p>
<p>vision of just beauty when you see people in unison,</p>
<p>standing, bowing, prostrating,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know who the person next to you is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where, Malcolm X,</p>
<p>you read about the history of Malcolm X,</p>
<p>when he went to Hajj,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where his entire worldview shifts.</p>
<p>Not just his previous baggage,</p>
<p>but the dream that he then had,</p>
<p>the possibilities that he saw for people</p>
<p>to be able to overcome some of the false distinctions</p>
<p>that we have, race and class,</p>
<p>and to see God as one and to come together</p>
<p>and worship Him alone and also seeing each other,</p>
<p>equal participants in that worship.</p>
<p>If we could just linger on it a little bit,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve mentioned that Malcolm X</p>
<p>has been in part misunderstood.</p>
<p>What are some aspects of him that are misunderstood?</p>
<p>I think reading his autobiography is extremely important</p>
<p>for anyone that wants to understand him, right?</p>
<p>So you read him in his own words.</p>
<p>Malcolm lived the tragedy of being a young,</p>
<p>disenfranchised black man in America</p>
<p>who went through all of the difficulties</p>
<p>that were posed in a 1950s America towards him.</p>
<p>I mean, he went through the system and it was awful for him.</p>
<p>And he had to pull himself out of that</p>
<p>and make himself into an incredible orator</p>
<p>and incredible leader</p>
<p>that suddenly had a pretty empowering vision</p>
<p>and a calm and nonetheless courageous,</p>
<p>but a calm presence to him.</p>
<p>And was able to bring together people,</p>
<p>especially uplift black people in America</p>
<p>to believe in themselves.</p>
<p>Young men in America and in prisons in particular</p>
<p>will read the autobiography of Malcolm X</p>
<p>and see hope for themselves</p>
<p>to come out of the darkness of being in prison,</p>
<p>not just by the bars in front of them,</p>
<p>but also by what they thought to be their own worth</p>
<p>prior to that moment.</p>
<p>And so Malcolm climbs out of that</p>
<p>and he goes through multiple phases.</p>
<p>So Malcolm dies as an Orthodox Muslim</p>
<p>who does not believe in the superiority</p>
<p>of one race over the other,</p>
<p>finds great tranquility in the practice of the Hajj,</p>
<p>great clarity.</p>
<p>And I think you read his letters from Mecca</p>
<p>and he talks about his change,</p>
<p>his transformation in particular.</p>
<p>And it was a process, it&rsquo;s a process for him,</p>
<p>but he inspires the likes of Muhammad Ali</p>
<p>to become the person that he becomes</p>
<p>and inspires many other people till today</p>
<p>to really see themselves and see the world differently</p>
<p>in light of that understanding of monotheism.</p>
<p>So he was deeply a man of faith</p>
<p>and throughout his life,</p>
<p>the nature of that faith has changed</p>
<p>as he grew, as he interacted with I would say</p>
<p>a cruel society that he was living.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>You mentioned he inspired Muhammad Ali,</p>
<p>who I don&rsquo;t think is an overstatement to say</p>
<p>is probably the most, quite possibly the most famous</p>
<p>American Muslim from America.</p>
<p>Could you maybe make a few comments as an athlete yourself?</p>
<p>What impact did Islam have on Muhammad Ali&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>and what, and vice versa,</p>
<p>what impact did he have as a leader,</p>
<p>as a religious figure on the Muslim community?</p>
<p>I think Muhammad Ali, his quotes on Islam are precious</p>
<p>because he talks about how he sought the wealth</p>
<p>of this world and he found it in Islam.</p>
<p>He found a greater meaning and he attributes</p>
<p>everything that he became to his faith,</p>
<p>his sense of strength and commitment,</p>
<p>the willingness to take a stand for the truth</p>
<p>when it was extremely unpopular on the basis of his faith</p>
<p>and on the basis of his integrity.</p>
<p>I think that he inspired people with his confidence</p>
<p>and his coherence.</p>
<p>I mean, he was incredibly eloquent.</p>
<p>I mean, poetic and just unwavering, seemed unbreakable.</p>
<p>So as relentless as he was in the ring,</p>
<p>he was even more so outside of the ring.</p>
<p>The man could not be broken</p>
<p>and everything was stacked up against him,</p>
<p>but he perseveres and he does so then through Parkinson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and chooses to live a life of giving, a life of service,</p>
<p>a life of using his platform to bring up issues</p>
<p>of importance and to champion the rights of others.</p>
<p>So he wasn&rsquo;t satisfied at any point in his life</p>
<p>with simply being a boxing great, a boxing champion.</p>
<p>He uses it for so much more.</p>
<p>And so he goes down as one of the most famous Americans</p>
<p>period of the 20th century,</p>
<p>one of the most transformative Americans period</p>
<p>of the 20th century, not just American Muslims.</p>
<p>And a lot of people that loved him when he died</p>
<p>would not have loved him</p>
<p>if they were around in the 1960s and the 1970s.</p>
<p>They said they loved him when he couldn&rsquo;t speak anymore.</p>
<p>Many of those who celebrated him at the time of his death</p>
<p>would have been his greatest opponents</p>
<p>at the peak of his career.</p>
<p>And when he was taking the stands that he was taking.</p>
<p>Yeah, he was fearless.</p>
<p>And part of his faith was helping him</p>
<p>take the fearless stance.</p>
<p>But throughout all of it, given the strength,</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s also a symbol of compassion.</p>
<p>Through all the fun kind of,</p>
<p>yeah, the poetic nature of who he was</p>
<p>and the fearless nature of who he was,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always like a deep love for the sport</p>
<p>and for humanity.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing, right?</p>
<p>It was so obvious that despite everything</p>
<p>that had happened to him, he never loses himself,</p>
<p>neither to the fame nor to the fear.</p>
<p>He always stays himself.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s authentic.</p>
<p>And I went to his funeral</p>
<p>and it was one of the most beautiful things I&rsquo;d ever seen</p>
<p>because everyone in Louisville, Kentucky</p>
<p>had a story with Muhammad Ali, right?</p>
<p>The guy that he saves from committing suicide,</p>
<p>the school kids, the hotel shuttle driver,</p>
<p>the gas station worker,</p>
<p>everyone has a story of Muhammad Ali in Louisville, Kentucky.</p>
<p>And when he passes away,</p>
<p>everybody comes out and stands in front of their homes</p>
<p>and they take the casket</p>
<p>and they drive around the streets of Louisville.</p>
<p>And he had this dream.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very close to some of his children,</p>
<p>incredible people, by the way, just incredible human beings.</p>
<p>And he had this dream that he shared with them</p>
<p>that he was jogging around the streets</p>
<p>of Louisville, Kentucky,</p>
<p>and everyone had come out to wave to him.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s running around jogging</p>
<p>and waving to everybody</p>
<p>in the streets of Louisville, Kentucky.</p>
<p>Then he gets to the cemetery</p>
<p>and he says he flies into the heavens.</p>
<p>So his dream, and he had this dream years ago.</p>
<p>I mean, if you look at his funeral, it&rsquo;s such a beautiful,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t make it up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a beautiful moment</p>
<p>where it seems to come to reality</p>
<p>because everybody in Louisville just comes out</p>
<p>and just waves by to his casket.</p>
<p>And then when he gets to the cemetery, the gates close</p>
<p>and he goes off to be with his Lord.</p>
<p>And we pray that it&rsquo;s a good place for him.</p>
<p>So Muhammad Ali is probably one</p>
<p>of the great 20th century representatives of Islam.</p>
<p>For me personally, at least,</p>
<p>hopefully I&rsquo;m not showing my bias.</p>
<p>One of the great modern representatives</p>
<p>is Khabib Nurmagomedov,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a great fighter and a great human being.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to meet him.</p>
<p>I should also say you&rsquo;re friends,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re good friends with a lot</p>
<p>of really interesting Muslim people.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s such a widespread religion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just so much variety of different people</p>
<p>that are practicing Muslims.</p>
<p>So what does Khabib represent?</p>
<p>What do you like about him as a Muslim?</p>
<p>What do you like about him as a person,</p>
<p>as representative of the religion?</p>
<p>I think Khabib, first of all,</p>
<p>he is a great person, humble person.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s shown, and now Islam as well,</p>
<p>kind of following in that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really showing the beauty of faith in their lives,</p>
<p>their culture, their values,</p>
<p>everything from the way that he carried himself</p>
<p>in a principled way.</p>
<p>Every Muslim kid grew up in a public school cafeteria</p>
<p>before Islamic schools were a thing in the United States,</p>
<p>not eating pork, for example,</p>
<p>and kind of being the odd person out.</p>
<p>So when you got a fighter in the UFC scene</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t drink alcohol,</p>
<p>kind of maintains like a very consistent,</p>
<p>principled attachment to his religion.</p>
<p>It really is inspiring.</p>
<p>Growing up, we had Hakeem Olajuwon in the 1990s,</p>
<p>basketball, who was fasting in the NBA.</p>
<p>I think Khabib is that for a lot of people,</p>
<p>a lot of young people today, and people in general.</p>
<p>And I think beyond that,</p>
<p>the values, how he honored his father,</p>
<p>and how he honors his mother,</p>
<p>and how he continues to put family first.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful part of Islam.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful part of our value system.</p>
<p>We have a lot of emphasis on family.</p>
<p>Family is central to Islam.</p>
<p>And his honoring of his father was so beautiful.</p>
<p>And again, what he&rsquo;s willing to do for his mother.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so beautiful.</p>
<p>And I think that we saw it, frankly,</p>
<p>even with Morocco and the World Cup.</p>
<p>There was a lot of Islamophobia</p>
<p>in this recent World Cup episode.</p>
<p>A lot of the criticism of Qatar,</p>
<p>while no government is beyond reproach,</p>
<p>certainly no government is beyond reproach,</p>
<p>but had very obvious, blatant Islamophobic undertones.</p>
<p>And then with Morocco rising,</p>
<p>being the first African Muslim Arab team</p>
<p>to get that far in the World Cup,</p>
<p>what did you see?</p>
<p>Beyond the consistent honoring of Palestine,</p>
<p>you also saw the honoring of the mothers.</p>
<p>Every single time the game would end,</p>
<p>they go into a prostration of gratitude.</p>
<p>So just like we prostrate in prayer,</p>
<p>a prostration of gratitude.</p>
<p>And then they go and they kiss their mother&rsquo;s foreheads,</p>
<p>dance with their mothers on the field,</p>
<p>hug their moms, and honor their moms.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Islam for you.</p>
<p>Khabib, after his fight, what does he do?</p>
<p>He prostrates.</p>
<p>He points up to the heavens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s God.</p>
<p>And then he prostrates.</p>
<p>The whole Moroccan team, beautifully, prostrates.</p>
<p>Even when they lost, they prostrated out of gratitude.</p>
<p>They honored their mothers.</p>
<p>So I think sometimes athletes are able to demonstrate</p>
<p>some of these beautiful values of Islam</p>
<p>in a way that the world can maybe see them</p>
<p>in a different light.</p>
<p>The values of humility and the values of love.</p>
<p>Love broadly, but love for family.</p>
<p>And look how everyone around Khabib talks about him.</p>
<p>No one ever says he&rsquo;s a jerk.</p>
<p>No one ever says he&rsquo;s mistreated them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve all got stories, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what a beautiful Muslim does,</p>
<p>a beautiful human being.</p>
<p>You treat the people in such a way</p>
<p>that all these stories come out later</p>
<p>of how good you were to everyone</p>
<p>that came into contact with you.</p>
<p>And Khabib was that person.</p>
<p>He is that person.</p>
<p>He does a great job of treating people with a lot of respect.</p>
<p>Obviously, no one is perfect, right?</p>
<p>I mean, imperfections are for everybody,</p>
<p>but I definitely think that he did a beautiful job</p>
<p>representing his faith in those moments.</p>
<p>Beyond punching people in the face,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of a different subject.</p>
<p>Smashing faces.</p>
<p>Not the smashing faces part.</p>
<p>The prostration part and the humility.</p>
<p>I tell you, man, he&rsquo;s not humble in the ring, right?</p>
<p>He would maul his opponents, right?</p>
<p>I mean, as a practitioner, as a fan of the sport,</p>
<p>of all grappling sports, for me,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also a beauty to the art of grappling</p>
<p>and the fighting sports, but yes.</p>
<p>I think his, again, humility,</p>
<p>his honor outside the cage is exemplary.</p>
<p>And the money, the fame, the power hasn&rsquo;t changed the man.</p>
<p>No, not at all.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually, I think, the most beautiful part.</p>
<p>When I met him, I found him to be as humble</p>
<p>as he is on screen.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s always very endearing.</p>
<p>And all of the stories of the people</p>
<p>that have been around him for a much longer time.</p>
<p>Very humble man.</p>
<p>I pray for him.</p>
<p>Honestly, I pray for Islam.</p>
<p>I pray for that family,</p>
<p>that God keeps them grounded and protected and together,</p>
<p>and that they maintain that beautiful spirit.</p>
<p>Because even if you just watch the lead up</p>
<p>to the last fight with Islam,</p>
<p>just the way they carry themselves, their day-to-day,</p>
<p>they never relinquish their prayers.</p>
<p>They never relinquish their family ties,</p>
<p>the things that make them who they are to be better fighters</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t see that</p>
<p>they have to let go of those things.</p>
<p>In fact, they attribute all of their worldly success</p>
<p>to that faith.</p>
<p>And so, beautiful examples.</p>
<p>And I think that it&rsquo;s good for young Muslims</p>
<p>to see themselves in that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s good for other people to see Islam</p>
<p>through that as well.</p>
<p>When you mention the prophets,</p>
<p>you often say, peace and blessings be upon them.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What does that phrase mean?</p>
<p>Why do you say it?</p>
<p>Is it to celebrate the people?</p>
<p>Is it as a constant reminder</p>
<p>that these are figures that should be celebrated?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s part of our tradition</p>
<p>that when we say the name of a prophet,</p>
<p>at least the first time in the conversation,</p>
<p>we say, peace be upon him.</p>
<p>And then afterwards,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still praiseworthy to say, peace be upon him.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re reading an Islamic article</p>
<p>and you see in parentheses, P-B-U-H,</p>
<p>peace be unto him or peace be upon him.</p>
<p>When I was in high school,</p>
<p>I often tell this story.</p>
<p>I wrote an article about Jesus, peace be upon him</p>
<p>in Islam and Christianity.</p>
<p>And my teacher comes up to me and she says,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>And I said, what?</p>
<p>And she like slams the paper on the desk.</p>
<p>She says, you can&rsquo;t say Jesus.</p>
<p>I said, no, no, P-B-U-H, peace be upon him.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what it means.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something that we reserve for the prophets of God</p>
<p>and we honor them with.</p>
<p>So who is Muhammad?</p>
<p>So the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him,</p>
<p>is the descendant of Abraham,</p>
<p>peace be upon him, through Ishmael.</p>
<p>God promises Hagar and Ishmael</p>
<p>that he will make of him a great nation.</p>
<p>And so there are prophets that are descended from Isaac.</p>
<p>And then from the brothers of Isaac</p>
<p>comes the prophet Muhammad.</p>
<p>And he is the final prophet of a long line of prophets.</p>
<p>And we do not distinguish between the prophets</p>
<p>in regards to their role.</p>
<p>And so Islam has a very accessible theology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that resonates with a professor</p>
<p>at an Ivy League university and a person</p>
<p>who may be even illiterate.</p>
<p>This idea of one God that sent many prophets</p>
<p>and all of the prophets had a singular message,</p>
<p>worship one God and respond to the messages</p>
<p>of that one God through his messengers.</p>
<p>So Adam, through Muhammad, you have many of the prophets</p>
<p>that are mentioned in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>Moses, peace be upon him,</p>
<p>being the most spoken about prophet in the Quran.</p>
<p>In fact, Abraham, Jesus, peace be upon him.</p>
<p>Many of these prophets that are familiar to people,</p>
<p>all of them are considered prophets in Islam.</p>
<p>The prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him,</p>
<p>being the last of them.</p>
<p>He comes at a time where there was still a lot</p>
<p>of confusion about what the world had just encountered</p>
<p>in Christ, in Jesus Christ, peace be upon him.</p>
<p>So you gotta think about it this way,</p>
<p>that this is still, he&rsquo;s born in the sixth century.</p>
<p>There is still great debate about who Jesus was.</p>
<p>The Council of Nicaea happens in the fourth century</p>
<p>where you kind of have a standardizing</p>
<p>of Western Christianity.</p>
<p>But then you have Eastern Christians</p>
<p>that are still maintaining very different theologies</p>
<p>and very different conceptions of Christ.</p>
<p>There is no Arabic Bible at the time.</p>
<p>And he kind of brings together the message</p>
<p>and the mission of all of those prophets.</p>
<p>And it fits perfectly into a singular string of thought</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t have to reject Jesus, peace be upon him,</p>
<p>but Islam also is staunchly opposed</p>
<p>to the idea of a trinity,</p>
<p>the idea of a begotten son of God.</p>
<p>That all of the conceptions of the Messiah,</p>
<p>and there were many claimants of the Messiah</p>
<p>prior to Christ, peace be upon him,</p>
<p>none of them included an idea of a trinity</p>
<p>or of him actually being a part of God himself,</p>
<p>a begotten son of God,</p>
<p>but rather a great and mighty prophet</p>
<p>that would restore glory on earth.</p>
<p>So he really captures theologically,</p>
<p>or rather we would say God captures</p>
<p>through him theologically,</p>
<p>a coherence and a unifying message of all of the prophets</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s only one God</p>
<p>and that that God has sent messages and scriptures</p>
<p>to ultimately guide people back towards him.</p>
<p>And that all of the prophets are equal in the sight of God.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no distinction between them.</p>
<p>And that we are to live our lives</p>
<p>in accordance with the message</p>
<p>as best manifested by the messenger.</p>
<p>And so the prophets are exemplary human beings.</p>
<p>And this is where we kind of sometimes</p>
<p>maybe have a difference.</p>
<p>Someone will say, well, Noah did this and David did this.</p>
<p>As Muslims, we don&rsquo;t believe,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t hold many of the stories</p>
<p>that have been attributed to these prophets to be true.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t believe that the prophets</p>
<p>are capable of major sins.</p>
<p>We believe they&rsquo;re exemplary human beings</p>
<p>and that they kind of give us a manifestation</p>
<p>of the scriptures that they were sent with,</p>
<p>of how to live noble lives.</p>
<p>And the most documented human being in history</p>
<p>is the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him.</p>
<p>We know everything about him, his family life,</p>
<p>his day-to-day, the way he would greet you,</p>
<p>the way he&rsquo;d look at you,</p>
<p>everything about his physical appearance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s documented in immaculate detail.</p>
<p>And Muslims have a standard</p>
<p>that they then seek to live up to</p>
<p>with how to treat your family,</p>
<p>how to be in your community,</p>
<p>how to be in your worship,</p>
<p>how to be in your social interactions,</p>
<p>how to carry yourself with your neighbors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a full, complete guidebook through his example</p>
<p>where we have the Quran, which is the word of God.</p>
<p>And then you have the biography</p>
<p>of the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him,</p>
<p>which is a living manifestation of that word</p>
<p>that has been documented for us to live by</p>
<p>until the end of time.</p>
<p>So, Muhammad, if I may, peace be upon him,</p>
<p>is really the, like you said, the manifestation,</p>
<p>the thing to be, the example of a good man.</p>
<p>Yes, example of a good human being.</p>
<p>Is the Quran the word of God?</p>
<p>So, the Quran, and this is what distinguishes the Quran</p>
<p>in many ways from other scriptures.</p>
<p>So, as Muslims, we do believe</p>
<p>that God has sent divine revelation prior.</p>
<p>We believe that the original scriptures</p>
<p>prior to the multiple versions</p>
<p>and the changes and revisions throughout history,</p>
<p>the original scriptures that were given to the prophets,</p>
<p>whether it was the Torah to Moses or the Gospels,</p>
<p>were all original divine revelations,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve been changed over time.</p>
<p>The Quran is the word of God</p>
<p>with a promise that he will guard it for all of time.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably one of the greatest miracles</p>
<p>because in 1400 years,</p>
<p>we have the Quran preserved through oral transmission</p>
<p>and through written transmission.</p>
<p>And there are almost 2 billion Muslims in the world,</p>
<p>and they all recite this book the exact same way,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s only one version of it.</p>
<p>And so, when I&rsquo;m reciting the Quran,</p>
<p>if I say oo or ee or ah differently,</p>
<p>an Ethiopian Muslim, a Chinese Muslim,</p>
<p>a Yemeni Muslim can correct me,</p>
<p>an eight-year-old kid in any one of those countries</p>
<p>can correct me because they will know</p>
<p>that this is not how it&rsquo;s memorized.</p>
<p>And so, it was memorized from the start,</p>
<p>committed to memory in the time</p>
<p>of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him,</p>
<p>and preserved in writing and passed down</p>
<p>and memorized by millions and millions</p>
<p>of people around the world.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s 600 pages,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t go to a city in America,</p>
<p>a city in the United States of America,</p>
<p>and not find at least one person</p>
<p>or a group of people that memorize it,</p>
<p>that have committed it to memory.</p>
<p>And so, there&rsquo;s an emphasis on committing it to memory,</p>
<p>as well as understanding it and applying it</p>
<p>and practicing it as much as we can.</p>
<p>What are some maybe deep</p>
<p>or insightful differences between the Quran,</p>
<p>the Torah, and the Bible?</p>
<p>Well, like I said, so you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>the original revelations of those scriptures,</p>
<p>but there are so many versions of those scriptures,</p>
<p>and there are times throughout history</p>
<p>where there have been changes,</p>
<p>just from an objective perspective, right?</p>
<p>What is the original scripture that was given</p>
<p>to Moses, peace be upon him?</p>
<p>And what was it initially communicated</p>
<p>to Jesus, peace be upon him?</p>
<p>And those things have changed over time.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s still some truth</p>
<p>that remains even in those scriptures.</p>
<p>And so, there are still things that line up,</p>
<p>especially with the Old Testament and Islam.</p>
<p>There are still many things that line up between the two,</p>
<p>the Bible as well, the New Testament.</p>
<p>Now, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s different because these are not original scriptures.</p>
<p>These are testimonies that were obviously collected</p>
<p>around the entire phenomenon of the coming of Christ,</p>
<p>but the authors themselves, the biographies,</p>
<p>the documentation, even of those original testimonies</p>
<p>and gospels, what made the cut in terms</p>
<p>of being included within the gospels and what didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>because there were many gospels at the time in that sense,</p>
<p>is different from what we believe was scripture</p>
<p>communicated to Jesus, peace be upon him.</p>
<p>The Quran is different in several ways,</p>
<p>but it confirms what came before it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the document and preserved word of God</p>
<p>to be recited throughout time.</p>
<p>So, it confirms much of what came before it,</p>
<p>and it resides amongst us and within us</p>
<p>for the rest of time.</p>
<p>And through it, we honor those revelations</p>
<p>that came through the prophets of old,</p>
<p>because the essence, the core of what came</p>
<p>through those revelations is preserved</p>
<p>in the Quran and with us.</p>
<p>I tell people this all the time,</p>
<p>that the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him,</p>
<p>introduced Jesus, peace be upon him,</p>
<p>and even Moses, peace be upon him, to much of the world.</p>
<p>There are Muslims around the world that are named Isa,</p>
<p>that are named Jesus.</p>
<p>There are Muslims around the world</p>
<p>that are named Ibrahim, Abraham.</p>
<p>Muslims around the world named Musa.</p>
<p>And they learned of these figures through the revelation</p>
<p>that came to the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him.</p>
<p>Noah, Maryam, one of the most popular names in Islam,</p>
<p>Mary, peace be upon her.</p>
<p>Whole chapter in the Quran named after Maryam,</p>
<p>which is actually what I was reciting in the prayer,</p>
<p>was the chapter of Maryam,</p>
<p>the chapter of the story of Mary, peace be upon her.</p>
<p>So, the Quran contains the stories.</p>
<p>It contains legislation and law,</p>
<p>but primarily it was revealed over 23 years.</p>
<p>So, it actually was coming in accordance</p>
<p>with some of the events that were unfolding</p>
<p>in the life of the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him.</p>
<p>The first 13 years of that was primarily belief in God,</p>
<p>belief in the hereafter,</p>
<p>and things that surrounded the core creed of Islam.</p>
<p>And then legislation, law, stories of the prophets</p>
<p>came down in accordance with the unfolding events,</p>
<p>as well as prophesizing some of the things that were to come</p>
<p>and speaking about some of the things that just happened.</p>
<p>And it is completed in the lifetime</p>
<p>of the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him,</p>
<p>memorized and then communicated to generation</p>
<p>after generation after generation</p>
<p>so that we have it in its pristine fashions.</p>
<p>Now, billions of people, just all across the world,</p>
<p>all the different cultures, all memorizing the same words.</p>
<p>One of the pillars, or maybe I should say</p>
<p>one of the central practices is the month of Ramadan.</p>
<p>What is the importance of this month?</p>
<p>What does the process of it entail also?</p>
<p>So Islam has, I think it&rsquo;d be good</p>
<p>to maybe lay this out for people.</p>
<p>Step back, yeah.</p>
<p>The articles of faith and the pillars of Islam.</p>
<p>So the articles of faith, or six articles of faith,</p>
<p>and this kind of lays the foundation for the creed of Islam.</p>
<p>So belief in God, belief in the angels,</p>
<p>belief in the messages, belief in the messengers, okay?</p>
<p>Belief in the day of judgment</p>
<p>and belief in divine decree.</p>
<p>So these are the six articles of faith.</p>
<p>Belief in God, belief in the angels,</p>
<p>belief in the messages, being the scriptures,</p>
<p>belief in the messengers, being the prophets,</p>
<p>belief in the day of judgment and belief in divine decree.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you have to believe to be a Muslim.</p>
<p>You have to believe in those six things, right?</p>
<p>And then you go to the pillars of faith.</p>
<p>The five pillars of faith are sort of,</p>
<p>they make up the structure of those articles of faith,</p>
<p>the practice of the Muslim.</p>
<p>So to be a Muslim, you testify that there&rsquo;s only one God</p>
<p>worthy of worship and unconditional obedience,</p>
<p>and then you testify that Muhammad</p>
<p>is the final messenger of God.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first pillar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the actual testimony entering into Islam.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s the five daily prayers.</p>
<p>Practicing the five daily prayers,</p>
<p>at least as a bare minimum obligation.</p>
<p>The mandatory charity, which is called the zakat,</p>
<p>that Muslims have to give at least 2.5%</p>
<p>of their retained earnings to specific categories of charity.</p>
<p>Then it is the fasting of the month of Ramadan,</p>
<p>the mandatory fasting of the month of Ramadan.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s the hajj, if you can do so,</p>
<p>the pilgrimage, if you can do so once in your lifetime.</p>
<p>So those are the five pillars of Islam.</p>
<p>So Ramadan is a month in which Muslims engage</p>
<p>in this incredible spiritual bootcamp.</p>
<p>Now, fasting can mean different things to different people.</p>
<p>When we fast, we fast from before sunrise to sunset</p>
<p>for an entire month, and there&rsquo;s no food or water, period.</p>
<p>And no intimacy as well.</p>
<p>So you would abstain from intimacy with your spouse as well</p>
<p>in that time.</p>
<p>No food or water, no bread, no nothing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t eat or drink, even if you live in Texas,</p>
<p>where you get these long, hot days in the summer.</p>
<p>And of course, Islam is on a lunar calendar,</p>
<p>so it moves every year about 10 days earlier.</p>
<p>During that time, you restrict the intake to the body</p>
<p>so that you can focus on the intake of the soul.</p>
<p>So instead of being focused on consumption,</p>
<p>constant consumption, you are consuming words</p>
<p>of remembrance, words of prayer.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re to be hyper-conscious of not doing anything</p>
<p>that would spiritually validate your fast,</p>
<p>just as you would physically.</p>
<p>So just like you won&rsquo;t eat or drink,</p>
<p>you certainly won&rsquo;t engage in sin.</p>
<p>Though you shouldn&rsquo;t engage in sins throughout the year,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not going to speak words of evil.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to gossip or slander.</p>
<p>You try to fast with your eyes,</p>
<p>not look at things that are not praiseworthy.</p>
<p>So you try to engage in a wholesome act</p>
<p>of disciplining yourself with a consciousness of God.</p>
<p>But then channel that into engaging the soul instead,</p>
<p>exercising the soul instead.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;ll find with Muslims</p>
<p>in this act of God consciousness,</p>
<p>where they reduce the consumption,</p>
<p>is they become far more grateful for the blessings of God,</p>
<p>because throughout our lives, we just take sips of water,</p>
<p>we eat what we can, we snack.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re abstaining from that,</p>
<p>you become so much more grateful for that sip of water,</p>
<p>so much more grateful for that bite of food,</p>
<p>so much more aware of the one</p>
<p>who provided those blessings to you,</p>
<p>so much more aware of those that don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the same access to those blessings that you have.</p>
<p>So you also develop a sense of empathy for the poor</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have access to those blessings</p>
<p>on a regular basis, that can&rsquo;t help but fast.</p>
<p>And on top of that, again, spiritually,</p>
<p>you are engaged in extra reading.</p>
<p>At that time, people are listening to more lectures.</p>
<p>People are engaged in extra acts of devotion,</p>
<p>extra acts of charity.</p>
<p>Muslims are most charitable in the month of Ramadan.</p>
<p>So you just feel great.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to explain to someone that doesn&rsquo;t do it,</p>
<p>because it sounds like torture to people, right?</p>
<p>What in the world are you doing,</p>
<p>you know, at four o&rsquo;clock on a hot Texas day,</p>
<p>not eating or drinking,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably dehydrated and cranky,</p>
<p>have a caffeine headache,</p>
<p>and you probably can&rsquo;t wait for this month to be over.</p>
<p>But in reality, you talk to Muslims,</p>
<p>their favorite time of the year is Ramadan.</p>
<p>You feel amazing.</p>
<p>You feel absolutely incredible,</p>
<p>because you taste a different type of consumption.</p>
<p>You feed your soul for a change.</p>
<p>And in that process, you connect with God in a way</p>
<p>that you simply could not without the distractions</p>
<p>of the day-to-day throughout the year.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s good that it&rsquo;s one month of the year,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s honestly physically taxing, right?</p>
<p>So it gives you a chance to experience it</p>
<p>for that one month,</p>
<p>but then you&rsquo;re encouraged to fast a few days of the year</p>
<p>as well, outside of the month of Ramadan,</p>
<p>to keep that connection.</p>
<p>What are the hardest parts that maybe for people</p>
<p>outside of the Muslim faith,</p>
<p>yeah, would be curious about?</p>
<p>Well, I think the hardest part is physically.</p>
<p>Is it physical or is it the spiritual?</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>So as Ramadan goes on, your acts of worship increase.</p>
<p>So in the last 10 nights of Ramadan,</p>
<p>there is an intense period of prayer throughout the night.</p>
<p>So every night in Ramadan,</p>
<p>we have something called the taraweeh prayers.</p>
<p>The taraweeh prayers are about an hour,</p>
<p>hour and a half of prayer outside of the five daily prayers.</p>
<p>So the mosques are packed every night in Ramadan.</p>
<p>The last 10 nights of Ramadan,</p>
<p>people will engage in prayer throughout the entire night.</p>
<p>So the only sleep that you&rsquo;re probably getting</p>
<p>is actually a couple of hours in the morning</p>
<p>before you go to work.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s everything sort of put together,</p>
<p>the disruption of schedule, the disruption of diet,</p>
<p>the physically exerting yourself.</p>
<p>But the way you feel is unmatched.</p>
<p>I mean, you feel so fulfilled through that deprivation.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually the point.</p>
<p>You know, it all ties back together</p>
<p>when you talk about even tests and trials</p>
<p>that God does not deprive us of anything</p>
<p>except that he gives us something greater in return.</p>
<p>And you do not deprive yourself of anything</p>
<p>for the sake of God,</p>
<p>except that he gives you something greater in return.</p>
<p>And so fasting is an exercise in patience</p>
<p>that unlocks an infinite sense of gratitude</p>
<p>and a greater connection to God.</p>
<p>So many people predict that Islam will surpass Christianity</p>
<p>as the largest religion by the end of the century,</p>
<p>by the number of its adherents and practitioners.</p>
<p>What responsibility does that place on people like you</p>
<p>who is a religious leader, who is somebody who teaches,</p>
<p>who grows, who cares for the community,</p>
<p>for the Muslim community, but actually for all people?</p>
<p>Well, I think what that means is that</p>
<p>we have a responsibility to teach and live our faith</p>
<p>in the most beautiful of ways,</p>
<p>that its values and ideals are not just expressed by you,</p>
<p>but experienced by everyone around you.</p>
<p>And so what I often teach my community is that,</p>
<p>look at the Muslims in the area,</p>
<p>what are your neighbors experiencing of you?</p>
<p>What are people experiencing of you?</p>
<p>You know, and there&rsquo;s statistics to Muslims</p>
<p>being the most charitable communities in America.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a community of great service,</p>
<p>a community of volunteering,</p>
<p>a community that greatly enriches the world around us.</p>
<p>I think that oftentimes people forget the history</p>
<p>of Muslims being at the forefront of contributing</p>
<p>in the areas of medicine and science</p>
<p>and all sorts of ways, education,</p>
<p>really changing the world through their commitment to faith.</p>
<p>But on a deeply personal level,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s important for us to be representatives</p>
<p>of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him,</p>
<p>in a way that makes Islamophobia impossible.</p>
<p>You know, I tell people this, that it&rsquo;s very hard.</p>
<p>You know, you mentioned the United States of Hate,</p>
<p>the documentary and the one man, the protester who met me</p>
<p>and sort of changed his worldview.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard for people to believe</p>
<p>what they hear about Islam if they see you live it.</p>
<p>Now that does not excuse bigotry,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t excuse the prejudice against Muslims,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s important for us to sort of take it</p>
<p>as a responsibility, as Muslims,</p>
<p>to channel our faith in the most beautiful of ways.</p>
<p>God describes faith in the Quran,</p>
<p>in the chapter of Abraham, peace be upon him,</p>
<p>as a tree with firm foundations,</p>
<p>the firm foundation being the testimony of faith,</p>
<p>the oneness of God.</p>
<p>So the tree of monotheism with firm foundations</p>
<p>and then branches high in the sky,</p>
<p>providing shade to everything and everyone around you</p>
<p>and producing fruit at all times.</p>
<p>The tree of faith of a Muslim is not seasonal.</p>
<p>So you should be producing with your faith at all times,</p>
<p>good works and things that people can actually experience.</p>
<p>And I think that Muslims have historically contributed</p>
<p>to the world around them.</p>
<p>And I think that Muslims today are still contributing</p>
<p>to the world around them,</p>
<p>but I think that we can never do enough</p>
<p>of holding ourselves accountable to the message</p>
<p>that we hold dear to our hearts</p>
<p>and trying to be the best representatives of that message</p>
<p>and of that messenger to the world around us.</p>
<p>So not only are you a religious leader</p>
<p>in the Muslim community,</p>
<p>but you have a lot of friends who are</p>
<p>from different religions.</p>
<p>You have a lot of Jewish friends,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve talked about a lot offline,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll probably hopefully get a chance</p>
<p>to talk to as well here.</p>
<p>But on that topic, let me bring up another tragic event</p>
<p>that was just a little bit less than a year ago</p>
<p>in this very community here in Dallas.</p>
<p>There was a synagogue hostage crisis.</p>
<p>Can you describe what happened</p>
<p>and what was your experience like through it and afterwards?</p>
<p>And what were the bad things you saw</p>
<p>and what are the good things you saw in the community?</p>
<p>The Collieville Synagogue situation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of surreal that we&rsquo;re coming up on a year of that.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll actually tell you exactly</p>
<p>what happened that morning.</p>
<p>I was out with the family and that morning,</p>
<p>I kid you not, that very morning,</p>
<p>I was telling my kids the story of Muhammad Ali</p>
<p>talking that man out of committing suicide off the roof.</p>
<p>And I showed them the YouTube video.</p>
<p>My wife pulled it up on her phone.</p>
<p>Kids were sitting in the back seat.</p>
<p>We talked about that video</p>
<p>and talked about that importance of helping people.</p>
<p>We also went to visit a loved one in the cemetery that day.</p>
<p>And we went to breakfast.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re out as a family that day, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of meaning that&rsquo;s sort of coming together</p>
<p>for us and a lot of discussion,</p>
<p>deep discussion we&rsquo;re having as a family.</p>
<p>And then some of our community groups,</p>
<p>we get this message that there is a synagogue</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been taken hostage,</p>
<p>a rabbi and his congregation taken as hostages.</p>
<p>And go to this Facebook link</p>
<p>and it was the feed of the synagogue.</p>
<p>And you could hear the gunmen shouting.</p>
<p>And it became apparent very early on</p>
<p>that it was a man that was claiming to be Muslim</p>
<p>that was holding them hostage.</p>
<p>Now, all these synagogue massacres,</p>
<p>all these places of worship</p>
<p>were not attacked by Muslims, right?</p>
<p>This is a different type of situation.</p>
<p>But my first instinct was,</p>
<p>like all that happened this morning was not random.</p>
<p>So I told my wife and I told my kids,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go down there to Collieville.</p>
<p>She was very supportive.</p>
<p>Obviously there was a moment of shock.</p>
<p>Kids were like, wait, what?</p>
<p>And I said, look, remember what we talked about this morning?</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t be indifferent to the stuff.</p>
<p>We still go back and revisit that day.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s crazy how it was all falling into place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an accident, right?</p>
<p>So I dropped them off at home</p>
<p>and I started to drive to Collieville.</p>
<p>I called the Irving Police Department</p>
<p>and I asked them to call the Collieville Police Department</p>
<p>so that they could kind of know that I&rsquo;m coming down there.</p>
<p>I called some of the faith leaders in the community</p>
<p>to see if they could put me in touch</p>
<p>with those on the ground</p>
<p>so that I wouldn&rsquo;t get shot when I showed up there.</p>
<p>And eventually I had to wait out outside</p>
<p>until I got clearance to come through</p>
<p>and to just offer whatever support I could,</p>
<p>pastoral support,</p>
<p>support with trying to free the hostages</p>
<p>of the synagogue at the time.</p>
<p>I was operating out of a church</p>
<p>right across the street from the synagogue.</p>
<p>A day long, just wondering what was gonna happen,</p>
<p>looking at the family of the rabbi at the time,</p>
<p>wondering what was going to happen</p>
<p>and trying to just be as supportive</p>
<p>as I possibly could at that time.</p>
<p>Thankfully, they all got out in the evening.</p>
<p>And I think that looking back on that day,</p>
<p>like my wife actually asked me,</p>
<p>she said, would you have done it differently?</p>
<p>And I said, no, I really wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because I think that things happen sometimes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to act on your good instincts sometimes, right?</p>
<p>And we talk about like being calculated.</p>
<p>I think sometimes we&rsquo;re calculated when we shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when that good instinct comes in</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re called to do something else, so.</p>
<p>What did it feel like to be a Muslim</p>
<p>in a situation like that?</p>
<p>I mean, did you, was there, were you a human being?</p>
<p>Were you a religious practitioner?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t, see, I can&rsquo;t separate anything</p>
<p>about myself in that situation, right?</p>
<p>So when I had to pray, I had to pray to help people out,</p>
<p>to give people words of comfort,</p>
<p>to try to appeal to the senses of whoever I could</p>
<p>at the time.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see myself as like a guy trying to,</p>
<p>trying to show a particular part of Islam there.</p>
<p>I just saw myself as someone that was trying</p>
<p>to help a family get their husband and father back, right?</p>
<p>And so it was more of just like that part of me was there.</p>
<p>You know, you can kind of see yourself, right?</p>
<p>And this is the irony of it.</p>
<p>When Christchurch, New Zealand happened,</p>
<p>that was kind of our worst nightmare as Texas Muslims,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve had armed groups in front of our mosques</p>
<p>threatening to do what that man did in Christchurch.</p>
<p>And so when you see a wife and kids</p>
<p>wondering if they&rsquo;re gonna get their dad back,</p>
<p>you kind of see yourself there.</p>
<p>And so I just saw myself in that situation.</p>
<p>What would I want people to be doing for me in that moment?</p>
<p>What would I want people to be telling my family</p>
<p>in that moment?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really where I went to,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really where I dug into.</p>
<p>And I prayed a lot that day, a lot, a lot,</p>
<p>for the right words, for the right actions,</p>
<p>what I could do to just help.</p>
<p>What are the lessons now, a year later,</p>
<p>that you take away from that day and the days?</p>
<p>So many lessons, just don&rsquo;t be indifferent.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be indifferent to the suffering around you,</p>
<p>or even that&rsquo;s distant from you,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s somehow related to you.</p>
<p>So just don&rsquo;t be indifferent.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re proud that you stepped up</p>
<p>and you went there and then?</p>
<p>Yeah, look, I don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I did much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being really honest.</p>
<p>This is not me trying to be humble here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I did much.</p>
<p>I think I did what I was called to do.</p>
<p>I wish that it never happened, right, as a whole,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m glad that the relationships</p>
<p>that have been built over time</p>
<p>came into being in that day, right,</p>
<p>where we could call upon people that we knew,</p>
<p>call upon each other, and as a community,</p>
<p>really come together.</p>
<p>You know, Dallas has been through a lot, a lot of pain,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve come together through a lot of pain as well.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of one of those things</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re united in our pain.</p>
<p>You know, when you suffer together,</p>
<p>you build certain bonds together.</p>
<p>So Dallas has been through a lot as a community,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve come together through a lot as a community.</p>
<p>Yeah, the thing about violence and war,</p>
<p>it destroys, it causes so much suffering,</p>
<p>but it also sort of brings out</p>
<p>some of the best aspects of human nature</p>
<p>and unites people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting way</p>
<p>how our human civilization functions.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the beauty that you don&rsquo;t just wanna see,</p>
<p>but you also wanna be.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re living in a climate</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot of that, right?</p>
<p>So how do you actually get through that</p>
<p>and actually not allow yourself to succumb to that</p>
<p>and be another voice in that polarization?</p>
<p>It seems that throughout history</p>
<p>and still in the world today,</p>
<p>religion has been a source of some of the,</p>
<p>of a lot of polarization,</p>
<p>a lot of conflict, even war.</p>
<p>Why do you think that is?</p>
<p>Listen, I think at the essence of it</p>
<p>is always some sort of political instability</p>
<p>that leaves behind a brutalized population</p>
<p>and vulnerabilities that can be exploited.</p>
<p>As I said, in the 20th century,</p>
<p>with the bloodiest century that we&rsquo;ve had to date,</p>
<p>where does religion fall in any of that?</p>
<p>Where does religion fall in the isms?</p>
<p>Where does religion fall in the world wars?</p>
<p>Where does religion fall in much of that?</p>
<p>Even when we talk about things like the Crusades,</p>
<p>remove the Islamic framing, the Crusades.</p>
<p>The Crusades, were they really about religion?</p>
<p>The Mongols and the destruction of the Mongols.</p>
<p>Was it about religion?</p>
<p>Myanmar and the Rohingya today, is it about Buddhism?</p>
<p>So I think that these are essentially political issues,</p>
<p>political causes, where you have people that rise up</p>
<p>and that use religion to disguise things</p>
<p>that are far, far, far from religion.</p>
<p>And if you want to manipulate a religious scripture,</p>
<p>you could turn any book, any scripture</p>
<p>into a violent scripture if you have a violent aim.</p>
<p>So I think that that&rsquo;s where you find people manipulating</p>
<p>versus manipulating religion to justify sick ideologies</p>
<p>that are based and thrive in political instability.</p>
<p>So these are fundamentally political geopolitical conflicts,</p>
<p>not religious conflicts.</p>
<p>Absolutely, look, when you talk about a group like ISIS,</p>
<p>Islam has been in Iraq for a very, very long time.</p>
<p>Iraq has been bombed by now five consecutive presidents</p>
<p>or four, it&rsquo;s been bombed into the stone ages.</p>
<p>There is no political infrastructure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s devastation and destruction</p>
<p>and desperation as a result of that.</p>
<p>Many of the old Saddam loyalists</p>
<p>and Saddam&rsquo;s regime was a secularist regime,</p>
<p>are now heads of ISIS, right?</p>
<p>It just moved into that.</p>
<p>When you create that type of chaos,</p>
<p>you generate an environment where groups like ISIS</p>
<p>are bound to rise out of.</p>
<p>And so Islam did not cause this.</p>
<p>People didn&rsquo;t wake up in Iraq one day and say,</p>
<p>hey, let&rsquo;s create a group called ISIS</p>
<p>because Islam tells us to, right?</p>
<p>Iraq was bombed into this place.</p>
<p>And we have to not just free religion</p>
<p>from the responsibility,</p>
<p>from having to bear the responsibility</p>
<p>of much of the hatred and violence,</p>
<p>but we have to interrogate the political instability</p>
<p>that was caused where we justified as Americans.</p>
<p>These are our taxpayer dollars</p>
<p>where we justified with what was done in Iraq.</p>
<p>Do we even know what was done in Iraq and Afghanistan?</p>
<p>These drones that drop using our tax dollars</p>
<p>under democratic and Republican regimes</p>
<p>and kill thousands of innocent people</p>
<p>in weddings in Yemen and Somalia, are these justified?</p>
<p>And when you think about dehumanization,</p>
<p>can the average American name a single victim</p>
<p>of the Iraq war?</p>
<p>Is there a picture that comes to your mind?</p>
<p>Is there a person?</p>
<p>Absolutely not, because that&rsquo;s the dehumanization.</p>
<p>And I often talk about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,</p>
<p>his progression as a faith leader in America,</p>
<p>as a political leader in America.</p>
<p>Dr. King was deeply unpopular</p>
<p>when he took his stand on Vietnam.</p>
<p>And he mentions how first he had to see Vietnam</p>
<p>through the lens of the soldiers,</p>
<p>because many of the soldiers</p>
<p>that were lost, American soldiers, right?</p>
<p>And that was a crime that they were sent to fight a war</p>
<p>that they should not have been sent to fight.</p>
<p>And there was an injustice that was done towards them.</p>
<p>He said, but things really changed</p>
<p>when he started to see it from the other side of the bullet,</p>
<p>when he started to see the world through Vietnam,</p>
<p>through the Vietnamese child.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where he resorted to breaking the silence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where he changed his tune,</p>
<p>because we dehumanize our victims so much</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not even relevant to our discourse</p>
<p>until they become able villains to our story.</p>
<p>And then now they&rsquo;re attacking us because they hate us.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re blowing us up because they hate us.</p>
<p>Their religion tells them to do this to us.</p>
<p>What have we allowed to be done to them</p>
<p>using our tax dollars in our name, right?</p>
<p>So I think that we have to interrogate</p>
<p>the political chaos that was caused,</p>
<p>not just free religion from the groups that were created,</p>
<p>but what was done to those countries</p>
<p>and what continues to be done in many of these places.</p>
<p>Yeah, when the pride that people had about America,</p>
<p>where everybody came together after 9-11</p>
<p>and there was all the American flags,</p>
<p>that was beautiful to see,</p>
<p>but then you have to transfer that.</p>
<p>And I wish all of us Americans could go and see</p>
<p>the daughters that would lose their parents,</p>
<p>the parents that would lose their daughters and sons</p>
<p>because bombs dropped,</p>
<p>the thousands, the tens of thousands of civilians</p>
<p>that died in Afghanistan and in Iraq</p>
<p>because of the decisions made in the name of politics.</p>
<p>Like if we just met those families</p>
<p>and if we empathize with them</p>
<p>and just put ourselves in their place,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s impossible not to feel hate for America, for everybody.</p>
<p>I mean, I visited Ukraine and spoke to a lot of Ukrainians</p>
<p>and they said,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s loved ones that are Russians before the war,</p>
<p>but now all they have is hate.</p>
<p>And if you ask many of them, will they ever forgive,</p>
<p>not the regime, not the soldiers,</p>
<p>will they ever forgive Russians?</p>
<p>Many of them say never.</p>
<p>And that never feels like it&rsquo;s a generational never.</p>
<p>Hmm, I mean, look, you think about this,</p>
<p>if your grandparents were wiped out in a drone attack,</p>
<p>your parents, your brothers, your sisters,</p>
<p>all of your loved ones, and you&rsquo;re missing a leg and an eye</p>
<p>and the world does not take you into consideration,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll never be seen or considered</p>
<p>in the halls of Congress or discussed.</p>
<p>What are you gonna grow up with, right?</p>
<p>But the thing is, is that we should not be speaking</p>
<p>about this only from the standpoint of,</p>
<p>oh shoot, they&rsquo;re gonna grow up and hate us.</p>
<p>We should be thinking about what was done to them</p>
<p>and hate that, despise that, that it&rsquo;s ugly.</p>
<p>You see, when people carry out a terrorist attack,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not considering the lives of the civilians</p>
<p>in these places.</p>
<p>So those that perpetrate the 9-11 attacks</p>
<p>are not seeing the thousands of people that they killed,</p>
<p>the human beings, the lives,</p>
<p>many of whom are Muslim, by the way, actually no.</p>
<p>One of them was a very active Muslim</p>
<p>in Islamic circle of North America.</p>
<p>I mean, they didn&rsquo;t see those stories, right?</p>
<p>When you drop a bomb on this many people,</p>
<p>when you drone people and you say, oops, collateral damage,</p>
<p>we were looking for one person, killed 40 people,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no count, no names,</p>
<p>nothing that can be recalled in the American memory,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a problem, a fundamental issue</p>
<p>with how we treat the rest of the world, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m an American, I think that I&rsquo;m responsible</p>
<p>to the extent that I have to critique these policies</p>
<p>and I have to try to challenge America</p>
<p>to deal with the world differently.</p>
<p>And when I go overseas, when I&rsquo;m around Muslims</p>
<p>in the Muslim world, right, in the Middle East</p>
<p>and in the Muslim world, I have to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking as a Palestinian American Muslim</p>
<p>who grew up in South Louisiana.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a complex background here, right?</p>
<p>A lot of experiences here that I&rsquo;m grateful for</p>
<p>because they all contribute to who I am</p>
<p>and what I know and what I&rsquo;ve been,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re all enriching.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t relinquish the Palestinian part.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t relinquish the American part</p>
<p>and I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t relinquish the Muslim part.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s helping people consider what they&rsquo;re not seeing.</p>
<p>And when you can dehumanize entire groups of people</p>
<p>to where you can reduce them to chalk casualty counts</p>
<p>and not be able to recall a single story,</p>
<p>then you have to take a step back and ask yourself,</p>
<p>what are we becoming, right?</p>
<p>What are we becoming?</p>
<p>Not a single victim of Afghanistan or Iraq.</p>
<p>Millions of people, not a single person</p>
<p>can the average American conjure in their head.</p>
<p>If you apply this to a very difficult topic</p>
<p>of Israel and Palestine.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, right?</p>
<p>You have been critical of the policies</p>
<p>of the state of Israel, but as we&rsquo;ve mentioned,</p>
<p>very supportive of Jewish people.</p>
<p>You have a lot of friends, rabbis and Jews in general</p>
<p>here in Dallas and across the world.</p>
<p>What is the difference to you in that part of the world</p>
<p>between politics and religion?</p>
<p>So in this case, Zionism and Judaism,</p>
<p>both terms broadly defined.</p>
<p>Both terms broadly defined.</p>
<p>So I say that because those terms,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s technical definitions</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;re popularly used.</p>
<p>And so you have to be kind of,</p>
<p>just like we said with Islamophobia,</p>
<p>these terms, they become politicized.</p>
<p>So just generally speaking, I think Zionism</p>
<p>has to do with politics and Judaism</p>
<p>has to do with religion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the great complexity to a lot of people,</p>
<p>like wait a minute, right?</p>
<p>And you gotta take a step back and wonder why</p>
<p>there are so many Zionist anti-Semites in America.</p>
<p>And there are so many anti-Zionists</p>
<p>who are far from being anti-Semites,</p>
<p>anti-Zionism that are opposed to the ideology,</p>
<p>that are opposed to the implications of it.</p>
<p>Look, I think that it&rsquo;s fundamentally secular.</p>
<p>When you think about it, there is an ethno-supremacism.</p>
<p>There is, I am the child of Palestinians</p>
<p>that were forcibly displaced from their land.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been able to go to where my parents,</p>
<p>my grandparents are from.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been able to see that land.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been able to access that.</p>
<p>I have cousins that I&rsquo;ll never be,</p>
<p>well, I shouldn&rsquo;t say never.</p>
<p>Inshallah, God willing, I will meet them,</p>
<p>but that I&rsquo;ve only been able to speak through a phone,</p>
<p>FaceTime, Zoom.</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s important for us</p>
<p>to separate criticism of Israel&rsquo;s policies</p>
<p>from anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s an injustice.</p>
<p>It cheapens anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>When you throw every person who is opposed to Zionism</p>
<p>or opposed to Israel&rsquo;s policies</p>
<p>in the bucket of being anti-Semites, it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>It cheapens it.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t do justice to it.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s important for us</p>
<p>to have a meaningful conversation</p>
<p>about America&rsquo;s support for Israel.</p>
<p>Listen, there are terms that are important here.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna throw out these big terms, right?</p>
<p>Apartheid, occupation, ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p>These are terms that are legal terms.</p>
<p>There are objective thresholds here</p>
<p>for apartheid, occupation, ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p>The threshold of apartheid has been crossed</p>
<p>according to multiple,</p>
<p>the most respectable human rights organizations</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>Organizations that you will champion</p>
<p>and that you will use in every single other conflict</p>
<p>to justify your own policies.</p>
<p>But that threshold of apartheid has been passed.</p>
<p>According to Human Rights Watch,</p>
<p>according to Amnesty International,</p>
<p>according to the Harvard Law Review,</p>
<p>the threshold of apartheid has been crossed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a legal terminology there.</p>
<p>Two sets of laws for two separate people.</p>
<p>You have a displaced people</p>
<p>that are forcibly being removed,</p>
<p>that are being treated differently,</p>
<p>that are stateless,</p>
<p>that are undergoing daily humiliation,</p>
<p>that live behind an apartheid wall,</p>
<p>that live under a different set of policies,</p>
<p>that are routinely bombarded,</p>
<p>that have lost their ability to free movement,</p>
<p>that have lost their ability to access</p>
<p>to basic necessities of human life.</p>
<p>There are legal definitions here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how any objective human being</p>
<p>can read those reports on apartheid</p>
<p>and the threshold crossed for apartheid</p>
<p>and walk away from that and say</p>
<p>that this is just Jews and Muslims</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t like each other.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a legal definition here.</p>
<p>Occupation.</p>
<p>When Israel was created in 1948,</p>
<p>you will find many Jews who are opposed to Zionism,</p>
<p>and I think this is important,</p>
<p>to talk to Jews who are opposed to Zionism,</p>
<p>and there are many that will say</p>
<p>that we were told that it was a land without a people</p>
<p>for a people without a land.</p>
<p>The problem with that was there were people there,</p>
<p>our ancestors, 750,000 Palestinians expelled in the Nakba,</p>
<p>and many Palestinians that have been removed and harassed</p>
<p>and that are treated in horrific ways,</p>
<p>and the occupation is expanding.</p>
<p>It is an illegal occupation.</p>
<p>The settlements are still expanding,</p>
<p>and the United States enables that occupation</p>
<p>with its funding, with its unconditional support,</p>
<p>unwavering support of Israel,</p>
<p>and it does so in a way that completely undermines</p>
<p>any of its claims to being a beacon of freedom in the world</p>
<p>because it is in plain sight now</p>
<p>that the world can see what is happening in Sheikh Jarrah,</p>
<p>what is happening in Jerusalem,</p>
<p>what is happening with these expanding settlements,</p>
<p>everything that flies in the face of any claim</p>
<p>to wanting a peaceful solution.</p>
<p>The children in Gaza, when I talk about dehumanization,</p>
<p>the children that were on the face of the New York Times,</p>
<p>which is historically</p>
<p>one of the most anti-Palestinian newspapers in America,</p>
<p>the faces of the children of Gaza,</p>
<p>America and many parts of the world are now seeing it.</p>
<p>We have been saying for a very long time,</p>
<p>this is apartheid, this is an occupation,</p>
<p>this is an injustice.</p>
<p>The world needs to check it, hold it accountable.</p>
<p>South Africa, which experienced apartheid,</p>
<p>Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu,</p>
<p>all of those that fought apartheid in South Africa</p>
<p>said that Palestinians are living under apartheid</p>
<p>and that the same strategies</p>
<p>that check the apartheid in South Africa</p>
<p>need to be used to hold Israel accountable</p>
<p>for apartheid with the Palestinians.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible for us as Palestinians</p>
<p>to simply say that we should give up on this cause</p>
<p>because all the odds are stacked against us.</p>
<p>But when you have videos coming out of the Israeli armies,</p>
<p>spewing skunk water, skunk water, sewage water</p>
<p>on worshipers leaving Al-Aqsa,</p>
<p>far-right leaders now taking the government</p>
<p>and the so-called only democracy in the Middle East</p>
<p>prohibiting a Palestinian flag</p>
<p>being raised anywhere around.</p>
<p>American reporter, Shireen Abu-Akla,</p>
<p>Palestinian-American Christian reporter,</p>
<p>Palestinian-American Christian reporter,</p>
<p>one of the most prominent journalists in the Middle East,</p>
<p>shot in the face, plain sight.</p>
<p>And all America could say was,</p>
<p>all the American government could say was,</p>
<p>if it turns out that it&rsquo;s indeed Israel,</p>
<p>that Israel is responsible</p>
<p>for the death of an American journalist,</p>
<p>then we will hold them accountable.</p>
<p>Nothing, not a peep.</p>
<p>It was a shame to see that happen.</p>
<p>And it just solidified to us</p>
<p>that whether it&rsquo;s a Democratic president</p>
<p>or a Republican president,</p>
<p>unfortunately, the support for Israel</p>
<p>is enabling it to continue</p>
<p>to wipe out the Palestinian population</p>
<p>from its historic land.</p>
<p>And so we see that happening.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll say this as well.</p>
<p>People ask me about the Abraham Accords.</p>
<p>They say, you know, you are talking about faith between,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re talking about peace between communities of faith</p>
<p>and protecting communities of faith.</p>
<p>Why are you opposed to the Abraham Accords?</p>
<p>I think that the name of Abraham should not be used.</p>
<p>And I wrote an article called</p>
<p>Why I Oppose the Abraham Accords.</p>
<p>The name of Abraham should not be used</p>
<p>to justify arms deals that only further disenfranchise</p>
<p>the abused population of the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Where, you know, you have quote unquote Muslim regimes</p>
<p>making peace with Israel,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s being used against the Palestinian people</p>
<p>who are only further disenfranchised</p>
<p>from having a voice in their own fate</p>
<p>for the sake of American arms deals</p>
<p>and security and economic benefits.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s despicable, it&rsquo;s repulsive.</p>
<p>Talk to the people, speak to people on the ground there,</p>
<p>see what&rsquo;s happening with your own two eyes</p>
<p>and think about the injustice</p>
<p>where our taxpayer dollars are being used</p>
<p>to suppress a people and what legally meets the definition</p>
<p>by every objective standard of apartheid,</p>
<p>of occupation, of ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s ongoing and it&rsquo;s happening in real time</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s becoming more blatant with a regime now</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s unapologetic of even expressing</p>
<p>what the policies have already done.</p>
<p>And that is the removal of a people</p>
<p>and the forcible removal of a people</p>
<p>because the government knows</p>
<p>that the United States support is unconditional.</p>
<p>Do you have hope that Jews, Muslims,</p>
<p>and Christians on this land</p>
<p>will live in peace one day together?</p>
<p>Have a basic respect for each other&rsquo;s humanity?</p>
<p>Look, this isn&rsquo;t a religious conflict.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s fundamentally one of the problems.</p>
<p>So even the question is not the correct question?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the correct question.</p>
<p>This is not a religious conflict.</p>
<p>Yes, religion is invoked.</p>
<p>Yes, there are religious elements,</p>
<p>but there are many Jews that are opposed</p>
<p>to what is happening right now towards the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Many.</p>
<p>And I would recommend a serious discussion</p>
<p>with even people whose perspectives have grown.</p>
<p>Peter Beinart being an example.</p>
<p>Rabbi Simone Zimmerman started If Not Now.</p>
<p>Beit Islam, an Israeli human rights organization</p>
<p>that also classed it as apartheid recently.</p>
<p>There are many Jews that are opposed</p>
<p>to what is happening right now.</p>
<p>Palestinians are also not exclusively a Muslim population.</p>
<p>Sharina Barakallah was Christian.</p>
<p>There are many Palestinian Christians</p>
<p>that are also being denied entry</p>
<p>into their historic churches</p>
<p>and that are completely bewildered</p>
<p>or absolutely lost in regards to why American evangelicals</p>
<p>have this ironclad support for the occupation</p>
<p>and have ignored the plight of Palestinian Christians.</p>
<p>Of course, I believe Muslims, Christians,</p>
<p>and Jews can coexist.</p>
<p>Of course, I have hope</p>
<p>because I have to have hope as a person of faith.</p>
<p>But as much hope as I have,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a great sense of urgency</p>
<p>for people to open their eyes,</p>
<p>learn what&rsquo;s actually happening on the ground,</p>
<p>read the reports,</p>
<p>stop letting these commentators</p>
<p>and these companies that are able to generate propaganda</p>
<p>own the narrative.</p>
<p>There are objective standards here.</p>
<p>There are objective measures of oppression</p>
<p>that need to be considered here.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening to Gaza</p>
<p>is one of the greatest atrocities of our time.</p>
<p>Learn about it, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d tell people to just watch the Vice documentaries,</p>
<p>for example, the mini documentaries.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d sent them to you as well</p>
<p>inside the battle for Jerusalem.</p>
<p>I mean, think about it.</p>
<p>A guy from Long Island, New York can fly to Israel, right?</p>
<p>Fly into Tel Aviv and walk into a home</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been occupied by families for generations</p>
<p>and throw the people out</p>
<p>under the full protection of the military there</p>
<p>and spit on them, historic homes.</p>
<p>And when people come up to me and say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re opposed to Islamophobia,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re opposed to Islamophobia, but they support that.</p>
<p>I tell you, you&rsquo;re not opposed to Islamophobia.</p>
<p>How can you be opposed to Islamophobia</p>
<p>when you traffic in the same framings</p>
<p>and dehumanization that enables the viciousness</p>
<p>towards Muslims here and Palestinians over there</p>
<p>that they do not deserve to be treated</p>
<p>like equal human beings, like full human beings.</p>
<p>And that based on historic claims,</p>
<p>a guy can fly from New York</p>
<p>into a historic neighborhood in Jerusalem</p>
<p>and kick out generational families</p>
<p>with military guns next to them.</p>
<p>What does that sound like?</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that normal, right?</p>
<p>And so I think that if people take the time to read,</p>
<p>people take the time to investigate,</p>
<p>then they come to this conclusion themselves</p>
<p>that this is unacceptable and that you can&rsquo;t put,</p>
<p>and this is one of the problems</p>
<p>with the framing of Israel-Palestine</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re equating occupier and occupied.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re equating the two sides of the conflict</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not a conflict, it&rsquo;s an occupation.</p>
<p>There is such a disparity of power here</p>
<p>that you cannot equate the two sides.</p>
<p>Malcolm X would say, you clip the bird&rsquo;s wing</p>
<p>and then blame it for not flying as high as you do.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do that to a people</p>
<p>and just equate them with their occupier</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an atrocity, it requires us to challenge it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m hopeful at the current movement</p>
<p>of Muslims, Christians, and Jews,</p>
<p>and people of all faiths that are saying enough is enough,</p>
<p>that thresholds have been crossed here,</p>
<p>that this is an atrocity that cannot continue.</p>
<p>This is very personal to me because this is happening now.</p>
<p>What I anticipate, and this is what America did,</p>
<p>this is what Nelson Mandela actually predicted</p>
<p>with the United States.</p>
<p>What I anticipate is that 10 years from now,</p>
<p>20 years from now, every American will say,</p>
<p>how could we have supported this?</p>
<p>And this was terrible.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll pay symbolic homage to the Palestinian cause.</p>
<p>But there are people now that are clinging on for dear life,</p>
<p>access to their places of worship,</p>
<p>access to their generational homes.</p>
<p>Right now, there are children that are in detention</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a bill in Congress to just stop,</p>
<p>I mean, wherever you stand on this issue,</p>
<p>child detainment, child detainment,</p>
<p>child detention should be a red line, right?</p>
<p>Congresswoman Betty McCollum has put this bill</p>
<p>on the floor of Congress, she can&rsquo;t even get that passed,</p>
<p>right, just to at least censure child detainment by the IDF.</p>
<p>So people need to look into this deeper.</p>
<p>They need to consider the human element of this</p>
<p>and consider the urgency of it as well.</p>
<p>With this new regime, it&rsquo;s only going to, unfortunately,</p>
<p>get much worse in the immediate term</p>
<p>and so we have to do something about it.</p>
<p>If I may ask you for some advice,</p>
<p>for a reason I&rsquo;ll explain maybe in a little bit,</p>
<p>or maybe I should just explain now,</p>
<p>which is, I think, because you&rsquo;ve talked about Islamophobia,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve been at the center</p>
<p>of so many catastrophic events,</p>
<p>because you sort of jump into the fire</p>
<p>to try to help people, you&rsquo;ve been attacked a lot,</p>
<p>just in general, you&rsquo;ve been under stress,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, you&rsquo;re not immune to stress.</p>
<p>So a part of me wants to ask</p>
<p>just how psychologically difficult it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>and where you draw strength,</p>
<p>and would you advise, if the opportunity is there,</p>
<p>for a person like me, for a silly kid in a suit,</p>
<p>to go to that part of the world</p>
<p>and take seriously conversations?</p>
<p>I would divide it into two categories.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s leaders and there&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>The leaders are sort of these political entities</p>
<p>that have their interests, but they also have power</p>
<p>and they want to hold on to power</p>
<p>and then people are just regular people</p>
<p>that have families that just want to</p>
<p>have basic rights and freedoms</p>
<p>and continue to love their families</p>
<p>to pursue different jobs and careers</p>
<p>and lives that they can flourish and so on.</p>
<p>Those are very kind of different dynamics at play.</p>
<p>And if given the opportunity to speak to leaders, for me,</p>
<p>would you advise I do it or not?</p>
<p>And when I say leaders,</p>
<p>I mean leaders that would make the case,</p>
<p>the pro-Zionist case and the anti-Zionist case.</p>
<p>And in both cases, I would make it</p>
<p>a very challenging conversations for both of them.</p>
<p>Unlike today, our conversation today,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re an inspiring, incredible person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of yours.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve spread so much love to the Muslim community here,</p>
<p>to the Jewish community, just everybody loves you.</p>
<p>Not everybody.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Not everybody.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But a lot of people love you, yes.</p>
<p>But this was kind of an inspiring</p>
<p>and a positive conversation.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t very challenging,</p>
<p>although we did touch challenging topics</p>
<p>and you did exceptionally well there.</p>
<p>But I would do very challenging conversation</p>
<p>with those leaders in that part of the world.</p>
<p>Is that a bad idea?</p>
<p>All right, well, let me tell you from now,</p>
<p>first and foremost, the first part,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t wanna lose the first part</p>
<p>of your conversation.</p>
<p>Is it psychologically stressful?</p>
<p>Very, very.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re a person of faith</p>
<p>and you believe that good work will always be rewarded</p>
<p>and that doing the right thing</p>
<p>will always be rewarded eventually,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to weather that storm quite a bit.</p>
<p>So your wife told you.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the second thing.</p>
<p>The holly bill was okay, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the second thing I was gonna mention</p>
<p>is honestly supportive, a supportive family.</p>
<p>My dad&rsquo;s 80, man, and he&rsquo;s been through a lot.</p>
<p>He was born in 1943, five years before Israel</p>
<p>was even created.</p>
<p>He was born in Palestine.</p>
<p>He suffered displacement.</p>
<p>He has been around the world</p>
<p>and somehow built himself up</p>
<p>to be a distinguished professor of chemistry,</p>
<p>an author, an inventor, grew up taking on</p>
<p>some of the most difficult challenges</p>
<p>and was just always a man of principle.</p>
<p>I always admired my dad being a man of principle.</p>
<p>And like, he just tells me, man, stay the course,</p>
<p>stay the course, don&rsquo;t be afraid, don&rsquo;t back down.</p>
<p>I have a supportive family.</p>
<p>I have a supportive wife.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got supportive kids.</p>
<p>So I have amazing people around me</p>
<p>that keep me grounded for sure.</p>
<p>And ultimately, obviously faith.</p>
<p>And also I&rsquo;ll say this, slander doesn&rsquo;t stand.</p>
<p>What do you mean by that?</p>
<p>When people slander you and it kind of comes</p>
<p>with the territory of a public figure,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to stand throughout time</p>
<p>because eventually any sincere person will find the truth.</p>
<p>And the only people that will regurgitate that</p>
<p>will continue to do so.</p>
<p>So when I get portrayed as an anti-Semite</p>
<p>because of my strong takes on Israel</p>
<p>and challenging Israel, and I will continue to do so,</p>
<p>it takes just people in doubt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we know him, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>So slander doesn&rsquo;t stand,</p>
<p>at least with the people that are important to you.</p>
<p>It might reside on the internet.</p>
<p>It might have great rankings and social media bots</p>
<p>that give it traction.</p>
<p>But ultimately-</p>
<p>But is that psychologically difficult to you</p>
<p>to have that-</p>
<p>Of course, yes, it is difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult and it&rsquo;s hurtful,</p>
<p>especially when it comes from quarters</p>
<p>that you would hope that it doesn&rsquo;t come from.</p>
<p>But you take a step back, you reevaluate,</p>
<p>you lean into your faith and you lean on the people</p>
<p>that are closest to you and then you keep going.</p>
<p>You learn the lessons.</p>
<p>Could I be doing something better?</p>
<p>Could I be doing something different?</p>
<p>Could I be saying something better?</p>
<p>Could I be saying something different?</p>
<p>Are the noble causes that I want to achieve,</p>
<p>am I doing justice by those causes?</p>
<p>How do I grow out of this, right?</p>
<p>You become wiser through these things as well.</p>
<p>The second part of your question though</p>
<p>about what you should do,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna talk to people,</p>
<p>talk to people from a place of inquiry.</p>
<p>I would say talk to people more so than leaders</p>
<p>and especially some of those who have been erased</p>
<p>from the media commentary.</p>
<p>Benjamin Netanyahu gets a lot of airtime</p>
<p>here in the United States.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s well-spoken.</p>
<p>He speaks perfect English.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an American as well.</p>
<p>I would challenge him on some of the things</p>
<p>that he has said and done.</p>
<p>He has an ongoing corruption case.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s a fascist.</p>
<p>I think that he&rsquo;s a person who has done much evil.</p>
<p>I think that he has a lot of blood on his hands</p>
<p>and I think that one day he will be prosecuted for that.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d say talk to people on the ground</p>
<p>and people that have been erased.</p>
<p>Talk to the families that are being displaced.</p>
<p>Sheikh Jarrah, I don&rsquo;t care about the political leadership.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d much rather you talk to the people on the ground</p>
<p>in East Jerusalem that have been displaced.</p>
<p>The families.</p>
<p>Talk to Palestinian Christians.</p>
<p>Talk to the sister of Sharina Abu-Akla,</p>
<p>Lina Abu-Akla, who was extremely disappointed</p>
<p>and let down when Joe Biden went to the region</p>
<p>and did not take her calls, did not meet her,</p>
<p>which was an absolutely disgraceful move.</p>
<p>He should have met with her.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the sister of an American journalist</p>
<p>who was murdered in cold blood.</p>
<p>Talk to Lina Abu-Akla.</p>
<p>Talk to Mitri Rahib.</p>
<p>Mitri, interesting person, for example.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a Lutheran.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the head of the Lutheran Church in Palestine.</p>
<p>He comes to Dallas sometimes and talks about</p>
<p>the plight of Palestinian Christians.</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;re talking to people in leadership,</p>
<p>obviously there are some that&rsquo;ll be able</p>
<p>to represent themselves in English.</p>
<p>Hanan Ashrawi is a very eloquent person, for example.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re gonna have any luck</p>
<p>getting into Gaza, but I&rsquo;ll pray for you if you do.</p>
<p>But obviously, if you wanna talk to everybody,</p>
<p>you gotta talk to everybody, man.</p>
<p>Well, and I also wanna say,</p>
<p>this is very important when you say whitewashing,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve heard this a lot also with Ukraine and Russia.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting line between whitewashing,</p>
<p>which is something you definitely should not do,</p>
<p>and a deep empathy for a large number of human beings.</p>
<p>A large number of human beings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really tricky line to walk.</p>
<p>And I also disagree with you about,</p>
<p>well, I think, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a disagreement,</p>
<p>but I think I disagree about leaders.</p>
<p>I think I agree 100% that the most important people</p>
<p>are the people on the ground.</p>
<p>But I think those are extremely important people</p>
<p>to understand, not just as leaders, but as human beings too.</p>
<p>And in many cases, to have a challenging conversation,</p>
<p>but from a place of empathy,</p>
<p>from understanding a human being.</p>
<p>So if you plan to talk to right-wing,</p>
<p>the current leadership of Israel,</p>
<p>my only request to you is talk to the victims themselves,</p>
<p>not the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>Talk to the victims.</p>
<p>I know you want to, right?</p>
<p>So I appreciate that.</p>
<p>Talk to the victims themselves.</p>
<p>Talk to those people that are being</p>
<p>thrown out of their homes.</p>
<p>Subjected to the daily humiliation.</p>
<p>Go to a checkpoint and walk through the checkpoint</p>
<p>the way that a Palestinian walks through a checkpoint</p>
<p>and tell me that&rsquo;s not apartheid.</p>
<p>Walk through that checkpoint,</p>
<p>crammed in in cages, and tell me it&rsquo;s not apartheid.</p>
<p>So I think you&rsquo;re a very sincere person.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re gonna do your best.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be praying for you.</p>
<p>Some of these things are harder than others,</p>
<p>but yes, I feel like we&rsquo;re in the middle of a negotiation</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve come to a point where we both agree.</p>
<p>Everyone deserves to be,</p>
<p>not everyone deserves to be,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s great value and benefit.</p>
<p>Let me say I agree with you in hearing people,</p>
<p>even tyrants, hearing them so that you can properly</p>
<p>deconstruct and decipher what you&rsquo;re hearing.</p>
<p>But just think of the voices that don&rsquo;t get heard.</p>
<p>And a lot of times what&rsquo;s been done to the Muslim world is,</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s being done right now</p>
<p>in the name of the Abraham Accords,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s wrong with the Palestinians?</p>
<p>The other Arabs are making peace with them.</p>
<p>Let me tell you something,</p>
<p>those regimes that are signing onto the Abraham Accords,</p>
<p>the people are not happy,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re terrified of challenging those regimes.</p>
<p>So if you go talk to the leaders of some of these countries</p>
<p>that have signed onto the Abraham Accords,</p>
<p>and that are in some twisted way</p>
<p>making this about religion and peace,</p>
<p>you can greatly skew the narrative</p>
<p>to where Palestinians are just</p>
<p>an inherently disagreeable people that don&rsquo;t want peace.</p>
<p>They just want to live in their homes.</p>
<p>They just want to live as full, equal human beings.</p>
<p>They want the things that everybody wants.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re only being further disenfranchised</p>
<p>in the name of peace now,</p>
<p>because voices are being amplified in the name of peace</p>
<p>that are suffocating voices for justice.</p>
<p>You said hope.</p>
<p>As a man of faith, you have hope.</p>
<p>What gives you hope about this part of the world</p>
<p>and our world in general,</p>
<p>when you look across and see so much conflict,</p>
<p>so much division happening?</p>
<p>What gives you hope?</p>
<p>I think that if you look through history,</p>
<p>we have been through points as a world</p>
<p>where we almost were not going to exist anymore.</p>
<p>If you lived in the time of the Crusades,</p>
<p>if you lived in some of these darker moments of history,</p>
<p>World War I, World War II,</p>
<p>you probably thought you weren&rsquo;t going to come out of this</p>
<p>as a world.</p>
<p>I have hope in God.</p>
<p>And I have hope that godly people,</p>
<p>people that are devoted to God and people of righteousness</p>
<p>can shift things with his help.</p>
<p>I also believe that younger people,</p>
<p>I hope they&rsquo;ll be different.</p>
<p>I think younger people,</p>
<p>hopefully, we&rsquo;re using the word hope a lot.</p>
<p>You might hear, inshallah, God willing,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll see the path that we&rsquo;re heading</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll seek to disrupt this bleak trajectory</p>
<p>and bring it back to something else.</p>
<p>We live in a time of hyperexposure.</p>
<p>That hyperexposure could paralyze you</p>
<p>or it could empower you.</p>
<p>It could make you completely shut down and say,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the point of even trying to help these people out?</p>
<p>Why even talk about the Palestinians?</p>
<p>You got these people here, the Uyghurs, the Rohingya,</p>
<p>you got what&rsquo;s happening in Honduras, Guatemala,</p>
<p>El Salvador, Brazil, South America, Africa, Ethiopia,</p>
<p>Somalia, it&rsquo;s so much and it can be overwhelming</p>
<p>to a person who cares.</p>
<p>But you ultimately realize that the difference</p>
<p>that you can make can become a much greater difference</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s after your lifetime.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you actually a story that,</p>
<p>I remember the first time I went to Syria,</p>
<p>Syrian refugee camps, and you deal with people</p>
<p>in this deeply human way.</p>
<p>For me, the most clarifying parts of the world</p>
<p>are the refugee camps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where I feel the most clarity in life</p>
<p>about what I&rsquo;m supposed to be doing in life.</p>
<p>You go to the refugee camps and then after you&rsquo;re interacting</p>
<p>with these people and maybe giving a few people</p>
<p>some trailer homes and some food</p>
<p>and something to sustain themselves,</p>
<p>some coats and blankets, you drive out of the refugee camps</p>
<p>back to where you&rsquo;re staying and the camps get bigger</p>
<p>and bigger and bigger and bigger and the people get smaller</p>
<p>and smaller and smaller and smaller.</p>
<p>But then you realize that it might be</p>
<p>that that small section that I touched</p>
<p>is going to be the change that affects all of them.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s gonna happen to that 12-year-old boy</p>
<p>that has seen the horrors of this world</p>
<p>and that is absolutely committed to uplifting his people</p>
<p>and bringing about a change,</p>
<p>being responsible for the plight of his people.</p>
<p>And so when I look at any section of devastation</p>
<p>in the world, you never know which part of it</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to touch that&rsquo;s going to change everything</p>
<p>by the grace of God, by the help of God.</p>
<p>So you keep trying to do your part.</p>
<p>The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him,</p>
<p>said that the most beloved of deeds to God</p>
<p>are the consistent ones, even if they&rsquo;re small.</p>
<p>That small act of charity, that small smile,</p>
<p>that small act of kindness, that small prayer</p>
<p>might go a long way if he blesses it.</p>
<p>So keep chipping away, chipping away, chipping away.</p>
<p>You never know.</p>
<p>Do not be paralyzed by the scale of the division,</p>
<p>just chip away at it.</p>
<p>Chip away at it.</p>
<p>One small step at a time.</p>
<p>I suppose all of us can do that.</p>
<p>Young people can do that.</p>
<p>Just one person at a time, try to help.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>Omar, you&rsquo;re an incredible person.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an inspiration.</p>
<p>I think you mentioned you came to Dallas for a podcast</p>
<p>and instead you got a friend.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an honor to be your new friend.</p>
<p>Appreciate it.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s time to go pray.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah, I hope it&rsquo;s okay that I join you</p>
<p>in at least in movement, in prayer.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>I appreciate you coming down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been an absolute pleasure.</p>
<p>He said,</p>
<p>I am a servant of Allah.</p>
<p>He gave me the Book and made me a prophet.</p>
<p>And made me blessed wherever I may be.</p>
<p>And enjoined upon me prayer and charity</p>
<p>as long as I am alive.</p>
<p>And was good to my mother</p>
<p>and did not make me a tyrant or a wretch.</p>
<p>And peace be upon me on the day I was born</p>
<p>and on the day I die</p>
<p>and on the day I am raised alive.</p>
<p>Allah.</p>
<p>Allah.</p>
<p>Allah.</p>
<p>Peace be upon you and Allah&rsquo;s mercy.</p>
<p>Peace.</p>
<p>Peace.</p>
<p>Peace.</p>
<p>Peace.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So much.</p>
<p>You sure you don&rsquo;t want to come back?</p>
<p>Do round two?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Thank you, man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great having you here.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Omar Suleiman.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Muhammad Ali.</p>
<p>Impossible is just a big word</p>
<p>thrown around by small men</p>
<p>who find it easier to live in a world</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been given</p>
<p>than to explore the power they have to change it.</p>
<p>Impossible is not a fact.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an opinion.</p>
<p>Impossible is not a declaration.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dare.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening</p>
<p>and hope to see you next time.</p>
