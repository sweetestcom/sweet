    <p>The following is a conversation with Eric Weinstein, the second time we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>spoken on this podcast, he&rsquo;s a mathematician with a bold and piercing</p>
<p>intelligence, unafraid to explore the biggest questions in the universe and</p>
<p>shine a light on the darkest corners of our society.</p>
<p>He is the host of the portal podcast, a part of which he recently released his</p>
<p>2013 Oxford lecture on his theory of geometric unity that is at the center of</p>
<p>his lifelong efforts to arrive at a theory of everything that unifies the</p>
<p>fundamental laws of physics.</p>
<p>This conversation was recorded recently in the time of the coronavirus pandemic</p>
<p>for everyone feeling the medical, psychological and financial burden of</p>
<p>this crisis, I&rsquo;m sending love your way.</p>
<p>Stay strong.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in this together.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll beat this thing.</p>
<p>This is the artificial intelligence podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, review it with five stars and apple</p>
<p>podcasts, support it on Patreon or simply connect with me on Twitter</p>
<p>at Lex Friedman spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>This show is presented by cash app, the number one finance app in the app store.</p>
<p>When you get it, use code Lex podcast.</p>
<p>Cash app lets you send money to friends by Bitcoin and invest in the stock</p>
<p>market with as little as $1.</p>
<p>Since cash app does fractional share trading, let me mention that the order</p>
<p>execution algorithm that works behind the scenes to create the abstraction of</p>
<p>the fractional orders is an algorithmic Marvel.</p>
<p>So big props to the cash app engineers for solving a hard problem that in the</p>
<p>end provides an easy interface that takes a step up to the next layer of</p>
<p>abstraction of the stock market, making trading more accessible to new</p>
<p>investors and diversification much easier.</p>
<p>So again, if you get cash app from the app store, Google play and use code</p>
<p>Lex podcast, you get $10 and cash app will also donate $10 to first an</p>
<p>organization that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education for</p>
<p>young people around the world.</p>
<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Eric Weinstein.</p>
<p>Do you see a connection between world war II and the crisis</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re living through right now?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>The need for collective action, reminding ourselves of the fact that all of these</p>
<p>abstractions, like everyone should just do exactly what he or she wants to do</p>
<p>for himself and leave everyone else alone.</p>
<p>None of these abstractions work in a global crisis.</p>
<p>And this is just a reminder that we didn&rsquo;t somehow put all that behind us.</p>
<p>When I hear stories about my grandfather who was in the army.</p>
<p>And so the Soviet union where most people die, when you&rsquo;re in the army,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a brotherhood that happens.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a love that happens.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;re going to see here?</p>
<p>Uh, since we&rsquo;re not there, I mean, what the Soviet union went through, I mean,</p>
<p>the enormity of the war on, uh, the Russian doorstep, this is different.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re going through now is not, we can&rsquo;t talk about Stalingrad and</p>
<p>COVID in the same breath yet.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not ready.</p>
<p>And the, the sort of, uh, you know, just the sense of like the great patriotic</p>
<p>war and the way in which I was very moved by the Soviet custom of,</p>
<p>of newlyweds going and visiting war memorials on their wedding day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the happiest day of your life.</p>
<p>You have to say thank you to the people who made it possible.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re just restarting history.</p>
<p>We, you know, I&rsquo;ve called this on the Rogan program.</p>
<p>I called it the great nap, the 75 years with, um, very little by historical</p>
<p>standards in, in terms of really profound disruption.</p>
<p>And so when you call it the great nap, meaning lack of deep global tragedy,</p>
<p>well, lack of realized global tragedy.</p>
<p>So I think that the development, for example, of the hydrogen bomb, you know,</p>
<p>was something that happened during the great nap.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t mean that people who lived during that time didn&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>feared and no anxiety, but it was to say that most of the violent potential</p>
<p>of the human species was not realized.</p>
<p>It was in the form of potential energy.</p>
<p>And this is the thing that I&rsquo;ve sort of taken issue with, with the description</p>
<p>of Steven Pinker&rsquo;s optimism is that if you look at the realized kinetic</p>
<p>variables, things have been getting much better for a long time, which is the</p>
<p>great nap, but it&rsquo;s not as if, uh, our fragility has not grown our dependence</p>
<p>on electronic systems, our vulnerability to disruption.</p>
<p>And so all sorts of things have gotten much better. Other things have gotten</p>
<p>much worse and the destructive potential is skyrocketed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tragedy.</p>
<p>The only way we wake up from the big nap.</p>
<p>Well, no, you could also have a, you know, jubilation about positive things, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s harder to get people&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>Can you give an example of a big global positive thing that could happen?</p>
<p>I think that when, for example, just historically speaking, uh, HIV</p>
<p>went from being a death sentence to something that people could live with</p>
<p>for a very long period of time.</p>
<p>It would be great if that had happened on a Wednesday, right?</p>
<p>Like all at once, like you knew that things had changed.</p>
<p>And so the bleed in somewhat kills the, the sort of the Wednesday effect</p>
<p>where it all happens on a particular day at a particular moment.</p>
<p>I think if you look at the stock market here, you know, there&rsquo;s a very clear</p>
<p>moment where you can see that the market absorbs the idea of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>I think that with respect to, um, positives, the moon landing was the best</p>
<p>example of a positive that happened at a particular time or, uh, recapitulating</p>
<p>the Soviet American, uh, link up in terms of, um, Skylab and Soyuz, right?</p>
<p>Like that was a huge moment when you actually had these two nations connecting.</p>
<p>Uh, in orbit.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, there are great moments where something beautiful and wonderful</p>
<p>and amazing happens, you know, but it&rsquo;s just, there are fewer of, that&rsquo;s why,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why as much as I can&rsquo;t imagine proposing to somebody at a sporting event,</p>
<p>when you have like 30,000 people waiting and you know, like she says, yes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty exciting.</p>
<p>So I think that we shouldn&rsquo;t, we shouldn&rsquo;t discount that.</p>
<p>So how bad do you think it&rsquo;s going to get in terms of, um,</p>
<p>of the global suffering that we&rsquo;re going to experience with this, with this crisis?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t figure this one out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not smart enough.</p>
<p>Something is going weirdly wrong.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re almost like two separate storylines.</p>
<p>We in one storyline, we aren&rsquo;t taking things nearly seriously enough.</p>
<p>We see people using food packaging lids as masks who are doctors or nurses.</p>
<p>Um, we hear horrible stories about people dying needlessly due to triage.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very terrifying story.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there&rsquo;s this other story, which says there are</p>
<p>tons of ventilators someplace.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got lots of masks, but they haven&rsquo;t been released.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got hospital ships where none of the beds are being used.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very confusing to me that somehow these two stories give me the feeling</p>
<p>that they both must be true simultaneously, and they can&rsquo;t both be true in any kind</p>
<p>of standard way, whether I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;m dumb, but I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get one or the other story to quiet down.</p>
<p>So I think weirdly, this is much more serious than we had understood it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not nearly as serious as some people are making it out to be at the</p>
<p>same time and that we&rsquo;re not being given the tools to actually understand, Oh,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s how to interpret the data, or here&rsquo;s the issue with the personal protective</p>
<p>equipment is actually a jurisdictional battle or a question of who pays for it</p>
<p>rather than a question of whether it&rsquo;s present or absent.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the details of it, but something is wildly off in our</p>
<p>ability to understand where we are.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s policy that&rsquo;s institutions.</p>
<p>What about, do you think about the quiet suffering of millions of</p>
<p>people that have lost their job?</p>
<p>Is this a temporary thing?</p>
<p>I mean, what I&rsquo;m my ears, not to the suffering of those people who have</p>
<p>lost their job or the 50% possibly a small businesses that are going to go</p>
<p>bankrupt, do you think about that?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s suffering.</p>
<p>Well, and how that might arise itself could be not quiet too.</p>
<p>I mean, right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the, could be a depression.</p>
<p>This could go from recession to depression and depression could go</p>
<p>to armed conflict and then to war.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a very, um, abstract causal chain that gets us to the point where</p>
<p>we can begin with quiet suffering and anxiety and all of these sorts of things</p>
<p>and people losing their jobs and people dying from stress and all sorts of things.</p>
<p>But, um, look, anything powerful enough to put us all indoors in a, I mean,</p>
<p>I think about this as an incredible experiment. Imagine that you proposed,</p>
<p>Hey, I want to do a bunch of research.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s figure out what changes in our emissions, emissions profiles for our</p>
<p>carbon footprints when we&rsquo;re all indoors or what happens to traffic patterns or</p>
<p>what happens to the vulnerability of retail sales, uh, as Amazon gets stronger,</p>
<p>you know, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>I believe that in many of those situations, um, we&rsquo;re running an incredible</p>
<p>experiment and I, am I worried for us all?</p>
<p>Yes, there are some bright spots.</p>
<p>One of which is that when you&rsquo;re ordered to stay indoors, people are</p>
<p>going to feel entitled and the usual thing that people are going to hit when</p>
<p>they hear that they&rsquo;ve lost your job, you know, there&rsquo;s this kind of tough,</p>
<p>um, tough love attitude that you see, particularly in the United States, like,</p>
<p>Oh, you lost your job, poor baby.</p>
<p>Well, go retrain, get another one.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s going to be a lot less appetite for that.</p>
<p>Um, because we&rsquo;ve been asked to sacrifice, to risk, to act collectively.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the interesting thing.</p>
<p>What does that reawaken in us?</p>
<p>Maybe the idea that we actually are nations and that, you know, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fellow countrymen may, may start to mean something to more people.</p>
<p>It certainly means something to people in the military, but I wonder how many</p>
<p>people who aren&rsquo;t in the military start to think about this as like, Oh yeah,</p>
<p>we are kind of running separate experiments and we are not China.</p>
<p>So you think this is kind of a period that might be studied for years to come.</p>
<p>From my perspective, we are a part of experiment, but I don&rsquo;t feel like</p>
<p>we have access to the full range of knowledge.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t feel like we have access to the full data, the full data of the</p>
<p>experiment, we&rsquo;re just like little mice in a large, does this one make sense to you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m romanticizing it and I keep connecting it to world war II.</p>
<p>So I keep connecting to historical events and making sense of them through that way</p>
<p>or reading the plague by Camus, like almost kind of telling narratives and</p>
<p>stories, but it might, I&rsquo;m not hearing the suffering that people are going</p>
<p>through because I think that&rsquo;s quiet there.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s numb currently.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not realizing what it means to have lost your job and</p>
<p>to have lost your business.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s kind of a, I don&rsquo;t, I, um, I&rsquo;m afraid how that fear will materialize</p>
<p>itself once the numbness wears out.</p>
<p>And especially if this lasts for many months, then if it&rsquo;s connected to</p>
<p>the incompetence of the CDC and the WHO and our government and perhaps the</p>
<p>election process, you know, my biggest fear is that the elections get delayed</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>So the, the, the basic mechanisms of our democracy get slowed or</p>
<p>damaged in some way that then mixes with the fear that people have that</p>
<p>turns to panic, that turns to anger, that anger.</p>
<p>Can I just play with that for a little bit?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>What if in fact, all of that structure that you grew up thinking about, and</p>
<p>again, you grew up in two places, right?</p>
<p>So, uh, when you were inside the U S we tend to look at all of these things as</p>
<p>museum pieces, like how often do we amend the constitution anymore?</p>
<p>And in some sense, if you think about the Jewish tradition of Simha Torah,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got this beautiful scroll that has been lovingly hand drawn and</p>
<p>calligraphy, um, that&rsquo;s very valuable.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very important that you not treat it as a relic to be revered.</p>
<p>And so we, one day a year, we dance with the Torah and we hold this incredibly</p>
<p>vulnerable document up and we treat it as if, uh, you know, it was Ginger</p>
<p>Rogers being, uh, led by Fred Astaire.</p>
<p>Well, that is how you become part of your country.</p>
<p>In fact, maybe the, maybe the election will be delayed.</p>
<p>Maybe extraordinary powers will be used.</p>
<p>Maybe any one of a number of things will indicate that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually living through history.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a museum piece that you were handed by your great, great grandparents.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re kind of suggesting that there might be a, like a</p>
<p>community thing that pops up like, like, um, as opposed to, uh, an angry revolution.</p>
<p>It might have a positive effect of, well, for example, are you telling me</p>
<p>that if the right person stood up and called for us to sacrifice PPE, uh, for</p>
<p>our nurses and our, our MDs who are on the front lines, that like people wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>reach down deep in their own supply that they&rsquo;ve been like stocking and carefully</p>
<p>storing them just say, like, say here, take it.</p>
<p>Like right now, an actual leader would use this time to bring out the heroic</p>
<p>character and I&rsquo;m going to just go wildly patriotic cause I frigging love this</p>
<p>country, we&rsquo;ve got this dormant population in the us that loves leadership</p>
<p>and country and pride in our freedom and not being told what to do.</p>
<p>And we still have this thing that binds us together and all of them,</p>
<p>the merchants of division just be gone.</p>
<p>I totally agree with you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, I think there is a deep hunger for that leadership.</p>
<p>Why hasn&rsquo;t that, why, why hasn&rsquo;t one of us, we don&rsquo;t have the right search</p>
<p>surgeon general, we have a guy saying, you know, come on guys, don&rsquo;t buy masks.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t really work for you.</p>
<p>Save them for our healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>No, you can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>You have to say, you know what, these masks actually do work and they more</p>
<p>work to protect other people from you, but they would work for you.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll keep you somewhat safer if you wear them.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got somebody who&rsquo;s taking huge amounts of viral load all the time</p>
<p>because the patients are shedding.</p>
<p>Do you want to protect that person who&rsquo;s volunteered to be on the front</p>
<p>line, who&rsquo;s up sleepless nights?</p>
<p>You just changed the message.</p>
<p>You stop lying to people.</p>
<p>You just, you level with them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s a little bit specific.</p>
<p>So you, you have to be just honest about the facts of the situation.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But I think you were referring to something bigger than just that inspiring,</p>
<p>like, you know, rewriting the constitution, sort of rethinking how</p>
<p>we work as a nation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think you should probably, you know, amend the constitution once</p>
<p>or twice in a lifetime so that you don&rsquo;t get this distance from the foundational</p>
<p>documents and, you know, part of the problem is that we&rsquo;ve got two generations</p>
<p>on top that feel very connected to the U S they feel bought in and we&rsquo;ve got three</p>
<p>generations below it&rsquo;s a little bit like watching your parents riding the tricycle</p>
<p>that they were supposed to pass on to you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re now too old to ride a tricycle and they&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>whooping it up, ringing the bell with the streamers coming off the handlebars.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re just thinking, do you guys never get bored?</p>
<p>Do you never pass a torch?</p>
<p>Do you really want it?</p>
<p>We had five septuagenarians all born in the forties running for president of the</p>
<p>United States when Clovis sure dropped out.</p>
<p>The youngest was Warren.</p>
<p>We had Warren Biden, Sanders, Bloomberg, and Trump from like 1949 to 1941.</p>
<p>All who had been the oldest president at inauguration and nobody&rsquo;s, nobody says</p>
<p>grandma and grandpa, you&rsquo;re embarrassing us except Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>Let me put it on you.</p>
<p>You have a big platform.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re somewhat of an intelligent, eloquent guy.</p>
<p>What, what role do you somewhat, what role do you play?</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t you that leader?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re, I mean, I would argue that you&rsquo;re in, in ways becoming a leader.</p>
<p>In ways becoming that leader.</p>
<p>So I haven&rsquo;t taken enough risk.</p>
<p>Is that your idea?</p>
<p>What should I do or say at the moment?</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re a little bit, no, you have taken quite a big risks</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll, we&rsquo;ll talk about it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re also on the outside shooting in, meaning, um, you&rsquo;re, uh, dismantling</p>
<p>the institution from the outside as opposed to becoming the institution.</p>
<p>Do you remember that thing you brought up when you were on the view, the view?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>When you were on Oprah, I didn&rsquo;t make, I didn&rsquo;t get the invite.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>When you were on Bill Maher&rsquo;s program, what was that thing you were saying?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know we&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>They may watch us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They may quietly slip us a direct message, but they pretend that this</p>
<p>internet thing is, uh, some dangerous place where only lunatics play.</p>
<p>Well, who has the bigger platform, the portal or Bill Maher&rsquo;s program or the</p>
<p>view, Bill Maher and the view in terms of viewership or in terms of what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the metric of size?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, the key thing is, um, take, take a newspaper and even</p>
<p>imagine that it&rsquo;s completely fake.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s very little in the way of circulation.</p>
<p>Yet imagine that it&rsquo;s an a hundred year old paper and that it&rsquo;s still part of</p>
<p>this game, this internal game of media.</p>
<p>The key point is, is that those sources that have that kind of, um, mark of</p>
<p>respectability to the institutional structures matter in a way that even if</p>
<p>I say something on a very large platform that makes a lot of sense, if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>outside of what I&rsquo;ve called the gated institutional narrative or gin, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry, institutional narrative or gin, it sort of doesn&rsquo;t matter to the</p>
<p>institutions. So the game is if it happens outside of the club, we can</p>
<p>pretend that it never happened.</p>
<p>How can you get the credibility and the authority from outside the, the</p>
<p>gated institutional narrative?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, you and I both share, um, institutional credibility coming</p>
<p>from organizations. So you, we were both at MIT, were you at Harvard at any</p>
<p>point? Nope. Okay.</p>
<p>Well, I lived in Harvard square.</p>
<p>So did I, but you know, at some level, the issue isn&rsquo;t whether you have</p>
<p>credentials in that sense.</p>
<p>The key question is, can you be trusted to file a flight plan and not deviate</p>
<p>from that flight plan when you are in an interview situation, will you stick to</p>
<p>the talking points?</p>
<p>Not, and that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re not going to be allowed in the general</p>
<p>conversation, which amplifies these sentiments, but I&rsquo;m still trying to, um,</p>
<p>so your, your point, it would be, is that we&rsquo;re, let&rsquo;s say both.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve done how many Joe Rogan for I&rsquo;ve done for two, right?</p>
<p>So both of us are somewhat frequent guests. The show is huge.</p>
<p>You know, the power as well as I do, and people are going to watch this</p>
<p>conversation. A huge number watched our last one, by the way, I want to thank</p>
<p>you for that one. That was a terrific, terrific conversation.</p>
<p>Really did change my life. Like you&rsquo;re brilliant interviewer. So thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you. That was that you changed my life too.</p>
<p>That you gave me a chance. So I was so glad I did that one.</p>
<p>What I would say is, is that we keep mistaking how big the audience is for</p>
<p>whether or not you have the kiss and the kiss is a different thing.</p>
<p>Yes. Yeah. Well, it doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s not an acronym yet. Okay. Um,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uh, but thank you for asking. It&rsquo;s a question of,</p>
<p>are you part of the inter interoperable institution friendly discussion?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the discussion which we ultimately have to break into.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to get at is how do we, how do you,</p>
<p>how does Eric Weinstein become the president of the United States?</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t become the president of the United States. Not interested.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for asking. Okay.</p>
<p>Get into a leadership position where I guess I don&rsquo;t know what that means,</p>
<p>but where you can inspire millions of people to, uh,</p>
<p>the inspire the sense of community, inspire the,</p>
<p>the kind of actions required to overcome hardship,</p>
<p>the kind of hardship that we may be experiencing to inspire people,</p>
<p>to work hard and face the difficult,</p>
<p>hard facts of the realities we&rsquo;re living through all those kinds of things that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about. That leader, you know,</p>
<p>can that leader emerge from the current institutions or</p>
<p>alternatively, can it also emerge from the outside?</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s what I was asking.</p>
<p>So my belief is,</p>
<p>is that this is the last hurrah for the elderly centrist kleptocrats.</p>
<p>Can you define each of those terms? Okay. Elderly.</p>
<p>I mean people who were born at least a year before I was,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a joke. You can laugh. Uh, no,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m born at the cusp of the gen X boomer divide. Um,</p>
<p>centrist they&rsquo;re pretending, you know,</p>
<p>there are two parties, Democrat and Republican party in the United States.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s easier to think of the mainstream of both of them as part of a,</p>
<p>an aggregate party that I sometimes call the looting party,</p>
<p>which gets us to kleptocracy, which is ruled by thieves.</p>
<p>And the great temptation has been to treat the U S like a trough.</p>
<p>And you just have to get yours because it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re doing anything</p>
<p>productive.</p>
<p>So everybody&rsquo;s sort of looting the family mansion and somebody stole the silver</p>
<p>and somebody is cutting the pictures out of the frames and you know,</p>
<p>roughly speaking, we&rsquo;re watching our elders, uh,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll live it up in a way that doesn&rsquo;t make sense to the rest of us.</p>
<p>Okay. So if it&rsquo;s the last hurrah,</p>
<p>this is the time for leaders to step up.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not ready yet. We&rsquo;re not ready.</p>
<p>I just disagree with that. I call, I call out, you know,</p>
<p>the head of the CDC should resign, should resign.</p>
<p>The surgeon general should resign. Trump should resign. Pelosi should resign.</p>
<p>De Blasio should resign. I understand that. So that&rsquo;s why. So we&rsquo;ll wait.</p>
<p>No, but that&rsquo;s not how revolutions work. You don&rsquo;t wait for people to resign.</p>
<p>You, uh, step up and inspire the alternative.</p>
<p>Do you remember the Russian revolution of 1907? It&rsquo;s before my time,</p>
<p>but there wasn&rsquo;t a Russian revolution of 1907.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re thinking we&rsquo;re in 1907. I&rsquo;m saying we&rsquo;re too early.</p>
<p>But we got this, you know, Spanish flu came in 17, 18.</p>
<p>So I would argue that there&rsquo;s a lot of parallels there or there were one.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not time yet. Like John Prine, the, uh,</p>
<p>uh, the songwriter just died of COVID. That was a pretty big,</p>
<p>really? Yeah. By the way, you, yes, of course. I, um,</p>
<p>every time we do this, uh,</p>
<p>we discover our mutual appreciation of obscure brilliant witty</p>
<p>songwriter. He&rsquo;s really, he&rsquo;s really quite good, right? He&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>Yeah. He died.</p>
<p>My understanding is that he passed recently due to complications of Corona.</p>
<p>Yeah. So we haven&rsquo;t had large enough,</p>
<p>enough large, large enough shocking deaths yet,</p>
<p>picturesque deaths, deaths of a family that couldn&rsquo;t get treatment.</p>
<p>There are stories that will come and break our hearts and we have not had enough</p>
<p>of those. The visuals haven&rsquo;t come in, but I think they&rsquo;re coming. Well,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll find out.</p>
<p>But that you gotta, you have to be there. He has to be there when they come.</p>
<p>I mean,</p>
<p>but we didn&rsquo;t get the visual for example of falling man from nine 11.</p>
<p>Right. So the outside world did, but Americans were not,</p>
<p>it was thought that we would be too delicate.</p>
<p>So just the way you remember Pulitzer prize winning photographs from the Vietnam</p>
<p>era,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t easily remember the photographs from all sorts of things that have</p>
<p>happened since because something changed in our media.</p>
<p>We are in sense that we cannot feel or experience our own lives and the tragedy</p>
<p>that would animate us to action.</p>
<p>Yeah. But I think there, again,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s going to be that suffering that&rsquo;s going to build and build and</p>
<p>build in terms of businesses,</p>
<p>mom and pop shops that close. And I, like,</p>
<p>I think for myself, I think often that,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m being weak and,</p>
<p>and like I feel like I should be doing something.</p>
<p>I should be becoming a leader on a small scale.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, this is not world war II, and this is not Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>Why not? Why not?</p>
<p>Because our internal programming,</p>
<p>the malware that sits between our ears is much different than the propaganda is</p>
<p>malware of the Soviet era. I mean,</p>
<p>people were both very indoctrinated and also knew that some level it was BS.</p>
<p>They had a double mind. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There must be a great word in Russian for being able to think both of those</p>
<p>things simultaneously.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think people are actually sick of the partisanship,</p>
<p>sick of incompetence.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I called for revolt the other day on Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>People found it quixotic.</p>
<p>Well, because I think you&rsquo;re not, I think revolt is different.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s like, okay, I&rsquo;m really angry. I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m furious.</p>
<p>I cannot stand that this is my country at the moment. I&rsquo;m embarrassed.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s build a better one. Yeah. Right. That&rsquo;s the, I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p>Okay. So, well, okay, so let&rsquo;s take over a few universities.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start running a different experiment at some of our better universities.</p>
<p>Like when I did this experiment and I said, what,</p>
<p>at this, if this were 40 years ago, the median age,</p>
<p>I believe of a university president was 51 that would have the person in gen X</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d have a bunch of millennial presidents, a bunch of, you know,</p>
<p>more than half gen X it&rsquo;s almost 100% baby boom at this point.</p>
<p>Um, and how did that happen?</p>
<p>We can get into how they changed retirement,</p>
<p>but this generation of people are not going to be able to do that.</p>
<p>But this generation above us does not feel for even even the older generous</p>
<p>silent generous. I had Roger Penrose on my program.</p>
<p>Excellent. And I thank you. I really appreciate that.</p>
<p>And I asked him a question that was very important to me. I said, look,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in your late eighties.</p>
<p>Is there anyone you could point to as a successor that we should be watching?</p>
<p>We can get excited. You know, I said,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s an opportunity to pass the baton and he said, well, let me,</p>
<p>let me hold off on that. It was like, Oh,</p>
<p>is it ever the right moment to point to somebody younger than you to keep your</p>
<p>flame alive after you&rsquo;re gone? And also like, I don&rsquo;t know whether,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to admit to this.</p>
<p>People treat me like I&rsquo;m crazy for caring about the world after I&rsquo;m dead</p>
<p>or wanting to be remembered after you&rsquo;re gone. Like, well,</p>
<p>what does it matter to you? You&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this deeply sort of secular somatic perspective on everything where we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t, you know, that phrase in a, as time goes by,</p>
<p>it says it&rsquo;s still the same old story, a fight for love and glory,</p>
<p>a case of do or die.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people imagined then that there wouldn&rsquo;t be a story about</p>
<p>fighting for love and glory.</p>
<p>And like we are so out of practice about fighting, you know,</p>
<p>rivals for love and and and and fighting for glory and something bigger than</p>
<p>yourself.</p>
<p>But the hunger is there.</p>
<p>Well, that was the point then, right? The whole idea is that Rick was,</p>
<p>you know, it was like Han Solo of his time. He&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>I stick my neck out for nobody. You know, it&rsquo;s like, Oh, come on, Rick,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just pretending you actually have a big soul. Right.</p>
<p>And so at some level, that&rsquo;s the question. Do we have a big soul or is it just</p>
<p>all bullshit?</p>
<p>So yeah, I think, I think there&rsquo;s huge Manhattan project style projects,</p>
<p>whether you talk about physical infrastructure or going to Mars, you know,</p>
<p>the SpaceX NASA efforts or huge,</p>
<p>huge scientific efforts.</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>we need to get back into the institutions and we need to remove the weak</p>
<p>leadership that we have weak leaders and the weak leaders need to be removed and</p>
<p>they need to seat people more dangerous than the people who are currently sitting</p>
<p>in a lot of those chairs.</p>
<p>Yeah. Or build new institutions. Good luck. Well,</p>
<p>so one of the nice things of, uh,</p>
<p>from the internet is for example,</p>
<p>somebody like you can have a bigger voice than almost anybody at the particular</p>
<p>institutions we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true. But the thing is I might say something.</p>
<p>You can count on the fact that the, you know,</p>
<p>provost at Princeton isn&rsquo;t going to say anything.</p>
<p>Yeah. What do you mean to, to afraid?</p>
<p>Well, if that person were to give an interview,</p>
<p>how are things going in research at Princeton? Well,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hesitant to say it,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re perhaps as good as they&rsquo;ve ever been and I think they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>get better. Oh, is that right? All fields? Yep. I don&rsquo;t see a weak one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, okay, great. Who are you and what are you even saying?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just used to total nonsense. 24 seven.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What do you think might be a beautiful thing that comes out of this?</p>
<p>Like what is there a hope that like a little inkling,</p>
<p>a little fire of hope you have about our time right now?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think one thing is coming to understand that the freaks, weirdos,</p>
<p>mutants, and other, uh,</p>
<p>near do wells, uh, sometimes referred to as grifters. I like that one.</p>
<p>Grifters, uh, and gadflies were very often the earliest people on the coronavirus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really interesting question. Why was that?</p>
<p>And it seems to be that they had already paid such a social price that they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t going to be beaten up by being, um,</p>
<p>told that, Oh my God, you&rsquo;re xenophobic. You just hate China, you know,</p>
<p>or wow, you sound like a conspiracy theorist. Um,</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;d already paid those prices, you were free to think about this.</p>
<p>And everyone in an institutional framework was terrified that they didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to be seen as the alarmist, the, um,</p>
<p>chicken little. And so that&rsquo;s why you have this confidence where, you know,</p>
<p>the Blasio says, you know, get on with your lives,</p>
<p>get back in there and celebrate Chinese new year in Chinatown.</p>
<p>Uh, despite coronavirus, it&rsquo;s like, okay, really?</p>
<p>So you just always thought everything would automatically be okay if you,</p>
<p>if you adapted, sorry, if you adopted that posture.</p>
<p>So you think, uh,</p>
<p>this time reveals the weakness of our institutions and reveals the strength of</p>
<p>our gadflies and the weirdos and the.</p>
<p>No, not necessarily the strength, but the, the, the value of freedom,</p>
<p>like a different way of saying it would be, wow,</p>
<p>even your gadflies and your grifters were able to beat your institutional folks</p>
<p>because your institutional folks were playing with a giant mental handicap.</p>
<p>So just imagine like we were in the story of Harrison Bergeron by Vonnegut and</p>
<p>our smartest people were all subjected to, uh,</p>
<p>distracting noises every seven seconds. Well,</p>
<p>they would be functionally much dumber because they couldn&rsquo;t continue a thought</p>
<p>through all the disturbance.</p>
<p>So in some sense, that&rsquo;s a little bit like what belonging to an institution is,</p>
<p>is that if you have to make a public statement,</p>
<p>of course the surgeon general is going to be the worst because they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just playing with too much of a handicap.</p>
<p>There are too many institutional players are like, don&rsquo;t screw us up.</p>
<p>And so the person has to say something wrong.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to back propagate a falsehood. And this is very interesting.</p>
<p>Some of my socially oriented friends say, Eric,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re on about. Of course masks work,</p>
<p>but you know what they&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to get us not to buy up the masks for the doctors. And I think,</p>
<p>okay,</p>
<p>so you imagine that we can just create scientific fiction at will so that you can</p>
<p>run whatever social program you want. This is what I, you know,</p>
<p>my point is get out of my lab, get out of the lab.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t belong in the lab. You&rsquo;re not meant for the lab.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re constitutionally incapable of being around the lab.</p>
<p>You need to leave the lab.</p>
<p>You think the CDC and WHO knew that masks work and we&rsquo;re trying to,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re trying to sort of imagine that people are kind of stupid and they would</p>
<p>buy masks in excess if they were told that masks work.</p>
<p>Is that like, uh,</p>
<p>cause this does seem to be a particularly clear example of mistakes made.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re asking me this question. No, you&rsquo;re not. What do you think, Lex?</p>
<p>Well, I actually probably disagree with you a little bit. Great. Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not so easy to be honest with the populace when the danger of</p>
<p>panic is always around the corner.</p>
<p>So I think the kind of honesty you exhibit appeals to a certain class of brave</p>
<p>intellectual minds that, uh, it appeals to me,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know from the perspective of WHO,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s so obvious that they should,</p>
<p>um, be honest 100% of the time with people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying you should be perfectly transparent and 100% honest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that the quality of your lies has to be very high and it has to be</p>
<p>public spirited. There&rsquo;s a big difference between, so I&rsquo;m not,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a child about this. I&rsquo;m not saying that when you&rsquo;re at war,</p>
<p>for example,</p>
<p>you turn over all of your plans to the enemy because it&rsquo;s important that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>transparent with 360 degree visibility. Far from it.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is something has been forgotten and I forgot who it was who</p>
<p>told it to me,</p>
<p>but it was a fellow graduate student in the Harvard math department and he said,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>I learned one thing being out in the workforce because he was one of the few</p>
<p>people who had had a work life in the department as a grad student.</p>
<p>And he said, you can be friends with your boss,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re going to be friends with your boss,</p>
<p>you have to be doing a good job at work.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an analog here,</p>
<p>which is if you&rsquo;re going to be reasonably honest with the population,</p>
<p>you have to be doing a good job at work as the surgeon general or as the head of</p>
<p>the CDC. So if you&rsquo;re doing a terrible job,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to resign.</p>
<p>And then the next person is supposed to say, look,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to lie to you. I inherited the situation.</p>
<p>It was in a bit of disarray.</p>
<p>But I had several requirements before I agreed to step in and take the job</p>
<p>because I needed to know I could turn it around.</p>
<p>I needed to know that I had clear lines of authority.</p>
<p>I needed to know that I had the resources available in order to rectify the</p>
<p>problem.</p>
<p>And I needed to know that I had the ability and the freedom to level with the</p>
<p>American people directly as I saw fit. All of my wishes were granted.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m happy here on Monday morning. I&rsquo;ve got my sleeves rolled up.</p>
<p>Boy, do we got a lot to do.</p>
<p>So please come back in two weeks and then ask me how I&rsquo;m doing then.</p>
<p>And I hope to have something to show you. That&rsquo;s how you do it.</p>
<p>So why is that excellence and basic competence</p>
<p>missing?</p>
<p>The big net. You see,</p>
<p>you come from multiple traditions where it was very important to remember</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>The Soviet tradition made sure that you remembered the sacrifices that came in</p>
<p>that war and the Jewish tradition we&rsquo;re doing this on Passover,</p>
<p>right? Okay. Well, every year we tell one simple story.</p>
<p>Well, why can&rsquo;t it be different every year?</p>
<p>Maybe we could have a rotating series of seven stories because it&rsquo;s the one</p>
<p>story that you need. It&rsquo;s like, you know, you work with the men in black group,</p>
<p>right? And it&rsquo;s the last suit that you&rsquo;ll ever need.</p>
<p>This is the last story that you ever need.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think I fell for your neuralyzer last time.</p>
<p>In any event, we tell one story because it&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>get out of Dodge story.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a time when you need to not wait for the bread to rise.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing, which is even if you live through a great nap,</p>
<p>you deserve to know what it feels like to have to leave everything that has</p>
<p>become comfortable and, and unworkable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad that you need, you need that tragedy.</p>
<p>I imagine to have the tradition of remembering</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s sad to to think that because things have been</p>
<p>nice and comfortable means that we can&rsquo;t have great competent leaders,</p>
<p>which is kind of the implied statement.</p>
<p>Like, can we have great leaders who take big risks,</p>
<p>who are, who inspire hard work,</p>
<p>who deal with difficult truth, even though things have been comfortable?</p>
<p>Well, we know what those people sound like. I mean, you know, if,</p>
<p>for example, Jaco Willink suddenly threw his hat into the ring,</p>
<p>everyone would say, okay, right.</p>
<p>Party&rsquo;s over. It&rsquo;s time to get up at four 30 and really work hard.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got to get back into fighting shape. And yeah,</p>
<p>but Jaco is a very special, I think,</p>
<p>that whole group of people by profession,</p>
<p>put themselves in the way of, and into hardship on a daily basis.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s not, I don&rsquo;t, well, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s probably not going to be, well, could Jaco be president?</p>
<p>Okay. But it doesn&rsquo;t have to be Jaco, right? Like in other words,</p>
<p>if it was Kai Lenny or if it was Alex</p>
<p>Honnold from rock climbing, right. But they&rsquo;re just serious people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re serious people who can&rsquo;t afford your BS.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But why do we have serious people that do rock climbing and uh,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have serious people who lead the nation? That seems to.</p>
<p>Because that was a,</p>
<p>those skills needed in rock climbing are not good during the big nap.</p>
<p>And at the tail end of the big nap, they would get you fired.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you think there&rsquo;s a fundamental part of human nature that desires to,</p>
<p>to excel, to be exceptionally good at your job?</p>
<p>Yeah. But what is your job? I mean, in other words, my, my,</p>
<p>my point to you is if you,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a general in a peacetime army and your major activity is playing war</p>
<p>games,</p>
<p>what if the skills needed to win war games are very different than the skills</p>
<p>needed to win wars? Because you know how the war games are scored and you&rsquo;ve,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve done money ball, for example, with war games,</p>
<p>you figured out how to win games on paper.</p>
<p>So then the advancement skill becomes divergent from the, uh,</p>
<p>ultimate skill that it was proxying for.</p>
<p>Yeah. But you create this, we&rsquo;re good as human beings to, I mean,</p>
<p>I, at least me, I can&rsquo;t do a big nap.</p>
<p>So at any one moment when I finish something,</p>
<p>a new dream pops up. So going to Mars,</p>
<p>what do you like to do? You like to do Brazilian jujitsu?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I like to do every, you like to play guitar,</p>
<p>guitar, you do this podcast, you do theory. You&rsquo;re always,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re constantly taking risks and exposing yourself. Right? Why?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve got one of those crazy, I&rsquo;m sorry to say it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got an Eastern European Jewish personality, which I&rsquo;m still tied to,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a couple of generations more distant than you are.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve held on to that thing because it&rsquo;s valuable to me.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a huge percent of the populace,</p>
<p>even in the United States. That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s that might be a little bit dormant,</p>
<p>but do you know Anna Hatchian from the red scare podcast?</p>
<p>Did you interview her? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I listened. Yeah, yeah, she was great.</p>
<p>She was great, right? Yeah. She&rsquo;s fun. She&rsquo;s, she&rsquo;s terrific.</p>
<p>But she also has the same thing going on.</p>
<p>And I made a joke in the liner notes for that episode,</p>
<p>which is somewhere on the road from Stalingrad to forever 21,</p>
<p>something was lost. Like how can Stalingrad and forever 21 be in the same</p>
<p>sentence? And, you know, in part it&rsquo;s that weird thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like trying to remember even words like I&rsquo;m in Russian and Hebrew things,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s like what pom yet then the score, you know,</p>
<p>these words have much more potency about memory and I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I do, I think, I think there&rsquo;s still a dormant populace that craves leaders on a</p>
<p>small scale and large scale.</p>
<p>And I hope to be that leader on a small scale.</p>
<p>And I think you sir have a role to be a leader.</p>
<p>You kids go ahead without me. I&rsquo;m just gonna,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do a little bit of weird podcast.</p>
<p>I see now you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re putting on your, uh, Joe Rogan hat.</p>
<p>Uh, he says, I&rsquo;m just a comedian. Oh no, I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;m just a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that if I say I want to lead too much because of the big nap,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a group, a chorus of automated idiots and their first thought is</p>
<p>like, ah, I knew it. So it&rsquo;s a power grab all along. Why should you lead?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>and so the idea is you&rsquo;re just trying to skirt around,</p>
<p>not stepping on all of the idiot landmines. It&rsquo;s like, okay,</p>
<p>so now I&rsquo;m going to hear that in my inbox for the next three days.</p>
<p>Okay. So lead by example, just live. No, I mean, the issue platform, look,</p>
<p>we should take over the institutions. There are institutions.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got bad leadership.</p>
<p>We should mutiny and we should inject a, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>15% 20% uh, disagreeable, dissident,</p>
<p>very aggressive loner, individual mutant freaks,</p>
<p>all the people that you go to see Avengers movies about or the X men or whatever</p>
<p>it is and stop pretending that everything good comes out of some great giant</p>
<p>inclusive, communal, uh, 12 hour meeting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, stop it. That&rsquo;s not how shit happens.</p>
<p>You recently published the video of a lecture you gave at Oxford presenting</p>
<p>some aspects of a theory, uh,</p>
<p>theory of everything called geometric unity.</p>
<p>So this was a work of 30, 30 plus years.</p>
<p>This is life&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Let me ask her the, the silly old question.</p>
<p>How do you feel as a human? Excited, scared,</p>
<p>the experience of posting it.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s funny. One of the, one of the things that you,</p>
<p>you learn to feel as an academic is, um,</p>
<p>the great sins you can commit in academics, uh,</p>
<p>is to show yourself to be a non serious person to show yourself to have</p>
<p>delusions,</p>
<p>to avoid the standard practices,</p>
<p>which everyone has signed up for.</p>
<p>And you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird because like, you know that those people are going to be angry.</p>
<p>He did what, you know, why would he do that? And,</p>
<p>and what we&rsquo;re referring to, for example,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s traditions of sort of publishing incrementally,</p>
<p>certainly not trying to have a theory of everything,</p>
<p>perhaps working within the academic departments, all those things.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s true. And so you&rsquo;re going outside of all of that.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I was going inside of all of that and we did not come to terms</p>
<p>when I was inside and what they did was so outside to me was so weird,</p>
<p>so freakish, like the most senior, respectable people at the most senior,</p>
<p>respectable places were functionally insane as far as I could tell.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s like being functionally stupid.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re the head of the CDC or something where, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re giving recommendations out that aren&rsquo;t based on what you actually</p>
<p>believe. They&rsquo;re based on what you think you have to be doing. Well,</p>
<p>in some sense,</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s a lot of how I saw the math and physics world as</p>
<p>the physics world was really crazy and the math world was considerably less</p>
<p>crazy, just very strict and kind of dogmatic.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ll psychoanalyze those folks,</p>
<p>but I really want to maybe linger on it a little bit longer of how you feel</p>
<p>because yeah, so this is such a, such a special moment in your life.</p>
<p>I really appreciate it. It&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>So that if we can pair off some of that other, those other issues. Um,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s new being able to say what the observers is,</p>
<p>which was my attempt to replace space time with something that is both closely</p>
<p>related to space, time and not space time. Um,</p>
<p>so I used to carry the number 14 as a closely guarded secret in my life and uh,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re 14 is really four dimensions of space and time plus 10.</p>
<p>Extra dimensions of rulers and protractors or for the cool kids out there,</p>
<p>uh, symmetric two tensors.</p>
<p>She had a geometric,</p>
<p>a complicated, beautiful geometric view of the world that you cared with you</p>
<p>for a long time. Yeah. Did you,</p>
<p>did you have friends that you, um, colleagues, essentially? No.</p>
<p>Talked. No. In fact, part of these, part of some of these stories are me,</p>
<p>coming out of the world,</p>
<p>to my friends, um, and I use the phrase coming out because I think that gays</p>
<p>have monopolized the concept of the closet.</p>
<p>Many of us are in closets having nothing to do with our sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Um, yeah, I didn&rsquo;t really feel comfortable talking to almost anyone.</p>
<p>So this was a closely guarded, uh, secret.</p>
<p>And I think that I let on in some ways that I was up to something and probably</p>
<p>I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was,</p>
<p>I was up to something and probably, but it was a very weird life. So I had to,</p>
<p>I had to have a series of things that I pretended to care about so that I could</p>
<p>use that as the stalking horse for what I really cared about. And to your point,</p>
<p>um, I never understood this whole thing about theories of everything.</p>
<p>Like if you were going to go into something like theoretical physics,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that what you would normally pursue?</p>
<p>Like wouldn&rsquo;t it be crazy to do something that difficult and that poorly paid if</p>
<p>you were going to try to do something other than figure out what this is all</p>
<p>about?</p>
<p>Now I have to reveal my cards,</p>
<p>my sort of weaknesses and lack and understanding of the music of physics and</p>
<p>math departments.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s an analogy here to artificial intelligence and often folks come in</p>
<p>and say, okay,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a giant department working on quote unquote artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>right? But why is nobody actually working on intelligence?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re all just building little toys, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not actually trying to understand. And that breaks a lot of people. Uh,</p>
<p>they, it confuses them because like, okay, so I&rsquo;m at MIT,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at Stanford, I&rsquo;m at Harvard, I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>I dreamed of being working on artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Why is everybody not actually working on intelligence?</p>
<p>And I have the same kind of sense that that&rsquo;s what working on the theory of</p>
<p>everything is that strangely you somehow become an outcast for even,</p>
<p>but we know why this is right. Why? Well, it&rsquo;s because let&rsquo;s take the artificial,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s play with AGI for example.</p>
<p>I think that the idea starts off with nobody really knows how to work on that.</p>
<p>And so if we don&rsquo;t know how to work on it,</p>
<p>we choose instead to work on a program that is tangentially related to it.</p>
<p>So we do a component of a program that is related to that big question because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s felt like at least I can make progress there.</p>
<p>And that wasn&rsquo;t where I was, where I was in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny there was this book of a called Frieden Uhlenbeck and it had this</p>
<p>weird mysterious line in the beginning of it.</p>
<p>And I tried to get clarification of this weird mysterious line and everyone said</p>
<p>wrong things. And then I said, okay, well,</p>
<p>so I can tell that nobody&rsquo;s thinking properly because I just asked the entire</p>
<p>department and nobody has a correct interpretation of this.</p>
<p>And so, you know, it&rsquo;s a little bit like you see a crime scene photo</p>
<p>and you have a different idea.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a smoking gun and you figure that&rsquo;s actually a cigarette lighter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really believe that. And then there&rsquo;s like a pack of cards and you think,</p>
<p>Oh,</p>
<p>that looks like the blunt instrument that the person was beaten with. You know,</p>
<p>so you have a very different idea about how things go.</p>
<p>And very quickly you realize that there&rsquo;s no one thinking about that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few human sides to this and technical sides,</p>
<p>both of which I&rsquo;d love to try to get down to. So the human side,</p>
<p>I can tell from my perspective, I think it was before April 1st, April Fools,</p>
<p>maybe the day before, I forget,</p>
<p>but I was laying in bed in the middle of the night and somehow it popped up,</p>
<p>you know on my feed somewhere that your beautiful face is speaking live and I</p>
<p>clicked. And you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of weird how the universe just brings things together in this kind of</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden I realized that there&rsquo;s something big happening at this</p>
<p>particular moment. It&rsquo;s strange. On a day,</p>
<p>like any day and all of a sudden you were thinking of,</p>
<p>you had this somber tone, like you were serious,</p>
<p>like you were going through some difficult decision and it seems strange.</p>
<p>I almost thought you were maybe joking,</p>
<p>but there was a serious decision being made and it was a wonderful experience</p>
<p>to go through with you.</p>
<p>I really appreciate it. I mean it was April 1st.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was, it&rsquo;s kind of fascinating. I mean it&rsquo;s just the whole experience.</p>
<p>And so I want to ask,</p>
<p>I mean thank you for letting me be part of that kind of journey of decision</p>
<p>making that took 30 years, but why now?</p>
<p>Why did you think,</p>
<p>why did you struggle so long not to release it and decide to release it now?</p>
<p>While the whole world is on lockdown on April Fools,</p>
<p>is it just because you like the comedy of absurd ways that the universe comes</p>
<p>together?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I think that the COVID epidemic is the end of the big nap.</p>
<p>And I think that I actually tried this seven years earlier in Oxford.</p>
<p>So I, uh, and it was too early.</p>
<p>Which part was too, is it the platform?</p>
<p>Cause your platform is quite different now actually the internet. I remember you,</p>
<p>uh, I read several of your brilliant answers that people should read for the</p>
<p>edge questions. One of them was related to the internet.</p>
<p>And it was the first one. Was it the first one? Yeah.</p>
<p>An essay called go virtual young man. Yeah. Yeah. That seemed,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like forever ago now. Well that was 10 years ago.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what I did is I decamped to the internet,</p>
<p>which is where the portal lives, the portal, the portal, the portal.</p>
<p>Well, so the whole, the theme, that&rsquo;s the ominous theme music,</p>
<p>which you just listened to forever.</p>
<p>I actually started recording a tiny guitar licks, uh,</p>
<p>for the audio portion, not for the video portion. Um,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve kind of inspired me with bringing your guitar into the story,</p>
<p>but keep going.</p>
<p>So you thought, so the Oxford was like step one and you kind of,</p>
<p>you put your foot into the, in the water to sample it,</p>
<p>but it was too cold at the time. So you didn&rsquo;t want to step in.</p>
<p>I was just really disappointed.</p>
<p>What was disappointing about that experience?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, it&rsquo;s a hard thing to talk about.</p>
<p>It has to do with the fact that, and I can see this,</p>
<p>this, you know, this mirrors a disappointment within myself.</p>
<p>There are two separate issues.</p>
<p>One is the issue of making sure that the idea is actually heard and explored.</p>
<p>And the other is the,</p>
<p>I is the question about will I become disconnected from my work because it will</p>
<p>be ridiculed. It will, it will be immediately improved.</p>
<p>It will be found to be derivative of something that occurred in some paper in</p>
<ol start="1957">
<li>When the community does not want you to gain a voice,</li>
</ol>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit like a policeman deciding to weirdly enforce all of these</p>
<p>little known regulations against you. And you know,</p>
<p>sometimes nobody else. And I think that&rsquo;s kind of, you know,</p>
<p>this weird thing where I just don&rsquo;t believe that we can reach the final theory</p>
<p>necessarily within the political economy of academics.</p>
<p>So if you think about how academics are tortured by each other and how they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>paid and where they have freedom and where they don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I actually weirdly think that that system of selective pressures is going to</p>
<p>eliminate anybody who&rsquo;s going to make real progress.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So if you look at the story of Andrew Wiles, for example,</p>
<p>with from our last term, I mean, he,</p>
<p>as far as I understand,</p>
<p>he pretty much isolated himself from the world of academics in terms of the big,</p>
<p>the bulk of the work he did.</p>
<p>And it from my perspective is dramatic and fun to read about,</p>
<p>but it seemed exceptionally stressful. The first step he took,</p>
<p>the first steps he took when actually making the work public that seemed to me</p>
<p>it would be hell, but it&rsquo;s like so artificially dramatic, you know,</p>
<p>he leads up to it at a series of lectures.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t want to say it. And then he finally says it at the end,</p>
<p>because obviously this comes out of a body of work where, I mean,</p>
<p>the funny part about from us last theorem is that wasn&rsquo;t originally thought to</p>
<p>be a deep and meaningful problem.</p>
<p>It was just an easy to state one that had gone unsolved.</p>
<p>But if you think about it,</p>
<p>it became attached to the body of regular theory.</p>
<p>So he built up this body of regular theory gets all the way up to the end</p>
<p>announces. And then like, there&rsquo;s this whole drama about, okay,</p>
<p>somebody&rsquo;s checking the proof. I don&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s going on in line 37,</p>
<p>you know, and like, Oh, is this serious?</p>
<p>It seems a little bit more serious than we knew.</p>
<p>I mean, do you see parallels?</p>
<p>Do you share the concern that your experience might be something similar?</p>
<p>Well, in his case, I think that if I recall correctly,</p>
<p>his original proof was unsalvageable.</p>
<p>He actually came up with a second proof with a</p>
<p>colleague, Richard Taylor.</p>
<p>And it was that second proof which carried the day.</p>
<p>So it was a little bit that he got put under incredible pressure and then had</p>
<p>to succeed in a new way, having failed the first time,</p>
<p>which is like even a weirder and stranger story.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an incredible story in some sense. But I mean, are you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get a sense of the kind of stress.</p>
<p>I think that this is okay, but I&rsquo;m rejecting what I don&rsquo;t think people</p>
<p>understand with me is the scale of the critique.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t, you, people say, well,</p>
<p>you must implicitly agree with this and implicitly agree. It&rsquo;s like, no,</p>
<p>try me ask before you,</p>
<p>you decide that I am mostly in agreement with the community about how these</p>
<p>things should be handled or what these things mean.</p>
<p>Can you, can you elaborate? And also just why, um,</p>
<p>does criticism matter so much here?</p>
<p>So you seem to dislike the burden of criticism that it will choke away all</p>
<p>different kinds of criticism.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s constructive criticism and there&rsquo;s destructive criticism.</p>
<p>And what I don&rsquo;t like is I don&rsquo;t like a community that can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>first of all, like if you take the physics community,</p>
<p>like just the way we screwed up on masks and PPE, uh,</p>
<p>just the way we screwed up in the financial crisis and mortgage backed</p>
<p>securities, we screwed up on string theory.</p>
<p>Can we just forget the string theory happened or sure,</p>
<p>but somebody should say that, right? Somebody should say, you know,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t work out. Yeah. But okay.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re asking this,</p>
<p>like why do you guys get to keep the prestige after failing for 35 years?</p>
<p>Yeah. That&rsquo;s an interesting question. You guys, because to me,</p>
<p>look these things, if there is a theory of everything to be had, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a relatively small group of people where this will be sorted</p>
<p>out. Absolutely. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not tens of thousands.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably hundreds at the top.</p>
<p>But within that, within that community,</p>
<p>there is the assholes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the, I mean, they, you have,</p>
<p>you always in this world have people who are kind, open minded.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a question about, okay,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s imagine for example,</p>
<p>that you have a story where you believe that ulcers are definitely</p>
<p>caused by stress and you&rsquo;ve never questioned it.</p>
<p>Or maybe you felt like the Japanese came out of the blue and attacked us at</p>
<p>Pearl Harbor, right?</p>
<p>And now somebody introduces a new idea to you, which is like,</p>
<p>what if it isn&rsquo;t stress at all?</p>
<p>Or what if we actually tried to make resource star of Japan attack us somewhere</p>
<p>in the Pacific so we could have cast this belly to enter the Asian theater</p>
<p>person&rsquo;s original idea is like, what, what are you even saying? You know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like too crazy. Well,</p>
<p>when Dirac in 1963</p>
<p>talked about the importance of beauty as a guiding principle in physics and he</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t talking about the scientific method, that was crazy talk,</p>
<p>but he was actually making a great point and he was using Schrodinger.</p>
<p>And I think it was Schrodinger was standing in for him and he said that if your</p>
<p>equations don&rsquo;t agree with experiment, that&rsquo;s kind of a minor detail.</p>
<p>If they have true beauty in them,</p>
<p>you should explore them because very often the agreement with experiment is</p>
<p>that it is an issue of fine tuning of your model of the instantiation.</p>
<p>And so it doesn&rsquo;t really tell you that your model is wrong.</p>
<p>And of course Heisenberg told Dirac that his model was wrong because that the</p>
<p>proton and the electron should be the same mass if they are each other&rsquo;s</p>
<p>anti particles.</p>
<p>And that was an irrelevant kind of silliness rather than a real threat to the</p>
<p>Dirac theory. But okay. So amidst all this silliness,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that we could talk about the journey that geometric unity has taken</p>
<p>and will take as an idea and an idea that we&rsquo;ll see the light.</p>
<p>Yeah. That. So first of all, let&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of writing a book called geometric unity for idiots. Okay.</p>
<p>And I need you as a consultant. So can we, first of all,</p>
<p>I hope I have the trademark on geometric unit. You do. Good.</p>
<p>Can you give a basic introduction of the goals of geometric unity?</p>
<p>The basic tools of mathematics use the viewpoints in general for idiots.</p>
<p>Sure. Like me. Okay. Great. Fun.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the goal of geometric unity?</p>
<p>The goal of geometric unity is to start with something so completely bland that</p>
<p>you can simply say, well,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a something that begins the game is as close to a mathematical.</p>
<p>Nothing is possible. In other words, I can&rsquo;t answer the question.</p>
<p>Why is there something rather than nothing?</p>
<p>But if there has to be a something that we begin from,</p>
<p>let it begin from something that&rsquo;s like a blank canvas.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s even more basic. So what is something, what are we trying to describe here?</p>
<p>Right now we have a model of our world and it&rsquo;s got two sectors.</p>
<p>Two sectors. One of the sectors is called general relativity.</p>
<p>The other is called the standard model.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll call it GR for general relativity and SM for standard model.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between the two? What are the two described?</p>
<p>So general relativity gives pride of place to gravity and everything else is</p>
<p>acting as a sort of a back, a backup singer.</p>
<p>Gravity is the star of the show. Gravity is the star of general relativity.</p>
<p>And in the standard model,</p>
<p>the other three non gravitational forces.</p>
<p>So if there are four forces that we know about three of the four non</p>
<p>gravitational, that&rsquo;s where they get to shine. Great.</p>
<p>So tiny little particles and how they interact with each other.</p>
<p>So photons, gluons and so called intermediate vector bosons.</p>
<p>Those are the things that the standard model showcases and general relativity</p>
<p>showcases gravity. And then you have matter,</p>
<p>which is accommodated in both theories,</p>
<p>but much more beautifully inside of the standard model.</p>
<p>So what, what is a theory of everything do?</p>
<p>So, so first of all, I think that that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the first place where we haven&rsquo;t talked enough.</p>
<p>We assume that we know what it means,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t actually have any idea what it means.</p>
<p>And what I claim it is, is that it&rsquo;s a theory where the questions beyond that</p>
<p>theory are no longer of a mathematical nature.</p>
<p>In other words, if I say, let us take, um,</p>
<p>X to be a four dimensional manifold</p>
<p>to a mathematician or a physicist. I&rsquo;ve said very little.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve simply said there&rsquo;s some place for calculus and linear algebra to,</p>
<p>to, uh, to dance together and to play.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what manifolds are. They&rsquo;re the most natural place where,</p>
<p>where our two greatest math theories can really, uh,</p>
<p>intertwine.</p>
<p>Which are the two? Oh, you mean calculus and linear algebra. Right. Okay.</p>
<p>Now the question is beyond that. So it&rsquo;s sort of like saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an artist and I want to order a canvas.</p>
<p>Okay. Now the question is, does the canvas paint itself?</p>
<p>Does the can, does the canvas come up with an artist</p>
<p>and paint an ink, which then paint the canvas? Like that&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the hard part about theories of everything,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t think people talk enough about.</p>
<p>Can we just, you bring up Escher and the hand that draws itself.</p>
<p>Is it the fire that lights itself or drawing hands, the drawing hands. Yeah.</p>
<p>And, uh, every time I start to think about that, my mind like, uh,</p>
<p>shuts down. Well, don&rsquo;t do that. There&rsquo;s a spark and this is the most beautiful</p>
<p>part. We should do this together. No, it&rsquo;s beautiful, but, uh,</p>
<p>this robot&rsquo;s brain, uh, sparks fly.</p>
<p>So can we try to say the same thing over and over in different ways about what,</p>
<p>what, what you mean by that having to be a thing we have to contend with?</p>
<p>Sure. Like why,</p>
<p>why do you think that creating a theory of everything,</p>
<p>as you call the source code are understanding our source code require a view</p>
<p>like the hand that draws itself. Okay.</p>
<p>Well here&rsquo;s what goes on in the regular physics picture.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got these two main theories, general relativity and the standard model.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Okay. Think of general relativity as more or less,</p>
<p>the theory of the canvas. Okay.</p>
<p>Maybe you have the canvas in a particularly rigid shape.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ve measured it. So it&rsquo;s got length and it&rsquo;s got angle,</p>
<p>but more or less it&rsquo;s just canvas and length and angle.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all that really general relativity is,</p>
<p>but it allows the canvas to warp a bit.</p>
<p>Okay. Then we have the second thing,</p>
<p>which is this import of foreign libraries where,</p>
<p>which aren&rsquo;t tied to space and time.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got this crazy set of symmetries called SU three cross SU two cross U</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got this collection of 16 particles in a generation,</p>
<p>which are these sort of twisted spinners.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got three copies of them.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;ve got this weird Higgs field that comes in and like Deus ex machina</p>
<p>solves all the problems that have been created in the play that can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>resolved otherwise.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the standard model of quantum field theory just plopped on top.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a problem of the double origin story.</p>
<p>One origin story is about space and time.</p>
<p>The other origin story is about what we would call internal quantum numbers and</p>
<p>internal symmetries.</p>
<p>And then there was an attempt to get one to follow from the other called</p>
<p>Kaluza Klein theory, which didn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>And this is sort of in that vein.</p>
<p>So you said origin story. So in the hand that draws itself,</p>
<p>what is it?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s as if you had the canvas and then you ordered</p>
<p>up also give me paint brushes, paints, pigments, pencils, and artists.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying that&rsquo;s like, if you want to create a universe from scratch,</p>
<p>the canvas should be generating the paintbrushes and the paintbrushes and the</p>
<p>artists, right? Like you should, who&rsquo;s the artist in this analogy?</p>
<p>Well, this is sorry.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;re going to get into a religious thing and I don&rsquo;t want to do that.</p>
<p>Okay. Well, you know my shtick, which is that we are the AI.</p>
<p>We have two great stories about the simulation and artificial general</p>
<p>intelligence. In one story,</p>
<p>man fears that some program we&rsquo;ve given birth to will become self aware,</p>
<p>smarter than us and we&rsquo;ll take over in another story.</p>
<p>There are genius simulators and we live in their simulation and we haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>realized that those two stories are the same story. In one case,</p>
<p>we are the simulator. In another case,</p>
<p>we are the simulated and if you buy those and you put them together,</p>
<p>we are the AGI and whether or not we have simulators,</p>
<p>we may be trying to wake up by learning our own source code.</p>
<p>So this could be our Skynet moment,</p>
<p>which is one of the reasons I have some issues around it.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll talk about that cause I,</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s the issue of the emergent artist within the story just to get back</p>
<p>to the point. Okay. So,</p>
<p>so now the key point is the standard way we tell the story is that Einstein sets</p>
<p>the canvas and then we order all the stuff that we want and then that paints the</p>
<p>picture that is our universe.</p>
<p>So you order the, the, the paint,</p>
<p>you order the artist,</p>
<p>you order the brushes and that then when you collide the two gives you two</p>
<p>separate origin stories.</p>
<p>The canvas came from one place and everything else came from somewhere else.</p>
<p>So what are the mathematical tools required to,</p>
<p>to construct consistent geometric theory?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, make this concrete.</p>
<p>Well, somehow you need to get three copies,</p>
<p>for example,</p>
<p>of generations with 16 particles each,</p>
<p>right? And so the question would be like, well, there&rsquo;s a lot,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of special personality in those symmetries.</p>
<p>Where would they come from? So for example,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got what would be called grand unified theories that sound like,</p>
<p>um, SU five, uh, the George I.</p>
<p>Glashow theory. There&rsquo;s something that should be called spin 10,</p>
<p>but physicists insist on calling it SO 10.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something called the petit salon theory that tends to be called SU four</p>
<p>cross SU two cross SU two, which should be called spin six cross spin four.</p>
<p>I can get into all of these.</p>
<p>What are they all accomplishing?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all taking the known forces that we see and packaging them up</p>
<p>to say, we can&rsquo;t get rid of the second origin story,</p>
<p>but we can at least make that origin story more unified.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re trying grand unification is the attempt to.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a mistake in your, in your.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a mistake that the problem is, is it was born lifeless. When,</p>
<p>when George I.</p>
<p>And Glashow first came out with the SU five theory, um,</p>
<p>it was very exciting because it could be tested in a South Dakota, um,</p>
<p>mine filled up with like, I dunno, cleaning fluid or something like that.</p>
<p>And they looked for proton decay and didn&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>And then they gave up because in that day,</p>
<p>when your experiment didn&rsquo;t work, you gave up on the theory.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t come to us born of a fusion between Einstein and,</p>
<p>and, and bore, you know,</p>
<p>and that was kind of the problem is that it had this weird parenting where it</p>
<p>was just on the bore side. There was no Einsteinian contribution.</p>
<p>Lex, how can I help you most? I&rsquo;m trying to figure,</p>
<p>what questions do you want to ask so that you get the most satisfying answers?</p>
<p>Uh, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a bunch,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of questions I want to ask. I mean, one,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to sneak up on you somehow to reveal</p>
<p>in a accessible way, then the nature of our universe.</p>
<p>So I can just give you a guess, right?</p>
<p>We have to be very careful that we&rsquo;re not claiming that this has been accepted.</p>
<p>This is a speculation, but I will, I will make the speculation that what,</p>
<p>I think what you would want to ask me is how can the canvas generate all the</p>
<p>stuff that usually has to be ordered separately? All right. Should we do that?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go there. Okay.</p>
<p>Okay. So the first thing is,</p>
<p>is that you have a concept in computers called technical debt.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re coding and you cut corners and you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to do it right before the thing is safe for the world,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re piling up some series of IO use to yourself and your project as</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going along.</p>
<p>So the first thing is we can&rsquo;t figure out if you have only four degrees of</p>
<p>freedom. And that&rsquo;s what your canvas is.</p>
<p>How do you get at least Einstein&rsquo;s world? Einstein says, look,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just four degrees of freedom,</p>
<p>but there need to be rulers and protractors to measure length and angle in the</p>
<p>world. You can&rsquo;t just have a flabby four degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>So the first thing you do is you create 10 extra variables,</p>
<p>which is like if we can&rsquo;t choose any particular set of rulers and protractors to</p>
<p>measure length and angle, let&rsquo;s take the,</p>
<p>take the set of all possible rulers and protractors.</p>
<p>And that would be called symmetric non degenerate two tensors on the tangent</p>
<p>space of the four manifold X four.</p>
<p>Now because there are four degrees of freedom,</p>
<p>you start off with four dimensions.</p>
<p>Then you need four rulers for each of those different directions.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s four that gets us up to eight variables.</p>
<p>And then between four original variables, there are six possible angles.</p>
<p>So four plus four plus six is equal to 14.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;ve replaced X four with another space, which in the lecture,</p>
<p>I think I called you 14, but I&rsquo;m now calling Y 14.</p>
<p>This is one of the big problems of working on something in private is every time</p>
<p>you pull it out, you sort of can&rsquo;t remember it. You name something, something new.</p>
<p>Okay. So you&rsquo;ve got a 14 dimensional world,</p>
<p>which is the original four dimensional world plus a lot of extra gadgetry for</p>
<p>measurement.</p>
<p>Yeah. And because you&rsquo;re not in the four dimensional world,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have the technical debt.</p>
<p>No, now you&rsquo;ve got a lot of technical debt because now you have to explain away</p>
<p>a 14 dimensional world, which is a big,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking a huge advance on your payday check, right?</p>
<p>But aren&rsquo;t more dimensions allow you more freedom to, I mean,</p>
<p>maybe, but you have to get rid of them somehow because we don&rsquo;t perceive them.</p>
<p>So eventually you have to collapse it down to the thing that we perceive or you</p>
<p>have to sample a four dimensional filament within that 14 dimensional world known</p>
<p>as a section of a bundle.</p>
<p>Okay. So how do we get from the four 14 dimensional world where I imagine a lot</p>
<p>of, oh, wait, wait, wait. Yep. You&rsquo;re cheating.</p>
<p>The first question was how do we get something from almost nothing?</p>
<p>Like how do we get the,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;ve said that the who and the what in the newspaper story that is a theory</p>
<p>theory of everything are bosons and Fermions. So let&rsquo;s make the who,</p>
<p>the Fermions and the what the bosons think of it as the players and the</p>
<p>equipment for a game.</p>
<p>Are we supposed to be thinking of actual physical things with mass or energy?</p>
<p>Okay. So think about everything you see in this room.</p>
<p>So from chemistry, you know, it&rsquo;s all protons, neutrons and electrons,</p>
<p>but from a little bit of late 1960s physics,</p>
<p>we know that the protons and neutrons are all made of up quarks and down quarks.</p>
<p>So everything in this room is basically up quarks, down quarks,</p>
<p>and electrons stuck together with, with the, the, what the equipment.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Now the way we see it currently is we see that there are space time indices,</p>
<p>which we would call spinners that correspond to the who that is the Fermions,</p>
<p>the matter, the stuff, the up quarks, the down quarks, the electrons.</p>
<p>And there are also</p>
<p>16 degrees of freedom that come from this in this space of internal quantum</p>
<p>numbers. So in my theory,</p>
<p>in 14 dimensions,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no internal quantum number space that figures in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all just spin oriel.</p>
<p>So spinners in 14 dimensions without any festooning with extra linear algebraic</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a concept of a, of, of, of spinners,</p>
<p>which is natural if you have a manifold with length and angle and Y 14 is almost</p>
<p>a manifold with length and angle. It&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so close. It&rsquo;s in other words,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re looking at the space of all rulers and protractors,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s not that surprising that a space of rulers and protractors might come</p>
<p>very close to having rulers and protractors on it itself.</p>
<p>Like can you measure the space of measurements and you almost can&rsquo;t in a space</p>
<p>that has length and angle.</p>
<p>If it doesn&rsquo;t have a topological obstruction comes with these objects called</p>
<p>spinners.</p>
<p>Now spinners are the stuff of of our world.</p>
<p>We are made of spinners. They are the most important,</p>
<p>really deep object that I can tell you about. They were very surprising.</p>
<p>What is a spinner? So famously,</p>
<p>there are these weird things that require 720 degrees of rotation in order to</p>
<p>come back to normal. And that doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>And the reason for this is that there&rsquo;s a knottedness in our three dimensional</p>
<p>world that people don&rsquo;t observe. And you know,</p>
<p>you can famously see it by this Dirac string trick.</p>
<p>So if you take a glass of water,</p>
<p>imagine that this was a tumbler and I didn&rsquo;t want to spill any of it.</p>
<p>And the question is if I rotate the cup without losing my grip on the base,</p>
<p>360 degrees and I can&rsquo;t go backwards,</p>
<p>is there any way I can take a sip? And the answer is this weird motion,</p>
<p>which is</p>
<p>go over first and under second.</p>
<p>And that that&rsquo;s 720 degrees of rotation to come back to normal so that I can</p>
<p>take a sip. Well, that weird principle,</p>
<p>which sometimes is known as the Philippine wine glass dance because waitresses</p>
<p>in the Philippines apparently learned how to do this.</p>
<p>Um,</p>
<p>so that that move defines if you will,</p>
<p>this hidden space that nobody knew was there of spinners,</p>
<p>which Dirac figured out when he took the square root of something called the</p>
<p>Klein Gordon equation, uh, which I think had earlier,</p>
<p>um, work incorporated from Cartan and killing and company in mathematics.</p>
<p>So spinners are one of the most profound aspects of human existence.</p>
<p>I mean, forgive me for the perhaps dumb questions, but, uh,</p>
<p>would a spinner be the mathematical objects that&rsquo;s the basic unit of our</p>
<p>universe?</p>
<p>When you, when you start with a manifold,</p>
<p>um, which is just like something like a donut or a sphere circle or a Mobius</p>
<p>band,</p>
<p>a spinner is usually the first wildly surprising thing that you found was</p>
<p>hidden in your original purchase.</p>
<p>So you,</p>
<p>you order a manifold and you didn&rsquo;t even realize it&rsquo;s like buying a house and</p>
<p>finding a panic room inside that you hadn&rsquo;t counted on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very surprising when you understand that spinners are running around on</p>
<p>your spaces.</p>
<p>Again, perhaps a dumb question,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re talking about 14 dimensions and four dimensions.</p>
<p>What is the manifold we&rsquo;re operating under?</p>
<p>So in my case, it&rsquo;s proto space time. It&rsquo;s before,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s before Einstein can slap rulers and protractors on space time.</p>
<p>What do you mean by that? Sorry to interrupt is space.</p>
<p>Time is the four D manifold.</p>
<p>Space time is a four dimensional manifold with extra structure.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the extra structure?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called a semi Ramanian or pseudo Ramanian metric.</p>
<p>In essence,</p>
<p>there is something akin to a four by four symmetric manifold.</p>
<p>Four symmetric matrix from which is equivalent to length and angle.</p>
<p>So when I talk about rulers and protractors,</p>
<p>or I talk about length and angle,</p>
<p>or I talk about Ramanian or pseudo Ramanian or semi Ramanian met manifolds,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m usually talking about the same thing.</p>
<p>Can you measure how long something is and what the angle is between two</p>
<p>different rays or vectors?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what Einstein gave us as his arena, his place to play, his his canvas.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bunch of questions I can ask here.</p>
<p>But like I said, I&rsquo;m working on this book, Geometric Unity for Idiots.</p>
<p>And and I think what would be really nice as your editor</p>
<p>to have like beautiful, maybe even visualizations that people could try to</p>
<p>play with, try to try to reveal small little beauties about the way you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking about the score.</p>
<p>Well, I usually use the Joe Rogan program for that.</p>
<p>Sometimes I have him doing the Philippine wine glass dance.</p>
<p>I had the hop vibration.</p>
<p>The part of the problem is that most people don&rsquo;t know this language about</p>
<p>spinners, bundles, metrics, gauge fields.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re very curious about the theory of everything, but they have no</p>
<p>understanding of even what we know about our own world.</p>
<p>Is it, is it a hopeless pursuit?</p>
<p>So like even gauge theory, right?</p>
<p>Just this, I mean, it seems to be very inaccessible.</p>
<p>Is there some aspect of it that could be made accessible?</p>
<p>I mean, I could go to the board right there and give you a five minute lecture</p>
<p>on gauge theory that would be better than the official lecture on gauge theory.</p>
<p>You would know what gauge theory was.</p>
<p>So it is, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s possible to make it accessible, but nobody does.</p>
<p>Like, in other words, you&rsquo;re going to watch over the next year, lots of</p>
<p>different discussions about quantum entanglement or, you know, the multiverse.</p>
<p>Where are we now?</p>
<p>Or, you know, many worlds, are they all equally real?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not going to hear anything about the hop vibration except if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s from me and I hate that.</p>
<p>Why, why can&rsquo;t you be the one?</p>
<p>Well, because I&rsquo;m going a different path.</p>
<p>I think that we&rsquo;ve made a huge mistake, which is we have things we can show</p>
<p>people about the actual models.</p>
<p>We can push out visualizations where they they&rsquo;re not listening by analogy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re watching the same thing that we&rsquo;re seeing.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;ve said to you before, this is like choosing to perform sheet music</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t been performed in a long time.</p>
<p>Or, you know, the experts can&rsquo;t afford orchestras.</p>
<p>So they just trade Beethoven symphonies as sheet music.</p>
<p>And they, Oh, wow, that was beautiful.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like, nobody heard anything.</p>
<p>They just looked at the score.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s how mathematicians and physicists trade papers and ideas is that</p>
<p>they, they write down the things that represent stuff.</p>
<p>I want to at least close out the thought line that you started, which is how does</p>
<p>the canvas order all of this other stuff into being so I at least want to say some</p>
<p>incomprehensible things about that.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll, we&rsquo;ll have that much done.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And that just point, does it have to be incomprehensible?</p>
<p>Do you know what the Schrodinger equation is?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Do you know what the Dirac equation is?</p>
<p>What does no mean?</p>
<p>Well, my point is you&rsquo;re going to have some feeling that, you know, what the</p>
<p>Schrodinger equation is, as soon as we get to the Dirac equation, your eyes are</p>
<p>going to get a little bit glazed, right?</p>
<p>So now why is that?</p>
<p>Well, the answer to me is, is that you, you want to ask me about the theory</p>
<p>of everything, but you haven&rsquo;t even digested the theory of everything as</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had it since 1928 when Dirac came out with his equation.</p>
<p>So for whatever reason, and this isn&rsquo;t a hit on you, you haven&rsquo;t been motivated</p>
<p>enough in all the time that you&rsquo;ve been on earth to at least get as far as the</p>
<p>Dirac equation.</p>
<p>And this was very interesting to me after I gave the talk in Oxford new scientist.</p>
<p>Who had done kind of a hatchet job on me to begin with sent a reporter to come to</p>
<p>the third version of the talk that I gave.</p>
<p>And that person had never heard of the Dirac equation.</p>
<p>So you have a person who&rsquo;s completely professionally, not qualified to ask</p>
<p>these questions wanting to know, well, how does, how does your theory solve</p>
<p>new problems and like, well, in the case of the Dirac equation, well, tell me</p>
<p>about that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>So then the point is, okay, I got it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not even caught up minimally to where we are now.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not a knock on you.</p>
<p>Almost nobody even knows where you are.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not a knock on you, almost nobody is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But then how does it become my job to digest what has been available</p>
<p>for like over 90 years?</p>
<p>Well, to me, the open question is whether what&rsquo;s been available for over 90 years</p>
<p>can be, um, there could be, uh, a blueprint of a journey that one takes to</p>
<p>understand it, not to do that with you.</p>
<p>And I, I, one of the things I think I&rsquo;ve been relatively successful at, for</p>
<p>example, you know, when you ask other people what gauge theory is, you get</p>
<p>these very confusing responses and my response is much simpler.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, oh, it&rsquo;s a theory of, uh, differentiation where when you calculate</p>
<p>the instantaneous rise over run, you measure the rise, not from a flat</p>
<p>horizontal, but from a custom endogenous reference level.</p>
<p>What do you mean by that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay.</p>
<p>And then I do this thing with Mount Everest, which is Mount Everest is how</p>
<p>high then they give the height I say above what then they say sea level.</p>
<p>And I say, which sea is that in Nepal?</p>
<p>Like, oh, I guess there isn&rsquo;t a sea cause it&rsquo;s landlocked.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, well, what do you mean by sea level?</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s this thing called the geoid I&rsquo;d never heard of.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s the reference level.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a custom reference level that we imported.</p>
<p>So you, all sorts of people have remembered the exact height of Mount</p>
<p>Everest without ever knowing what it&rsquo;s a height from.</p>
<p>Well, in this case, engage theory, there&rsquo;s a hidden reference level where</p>
<p>you measure the rise in rise over run to give the slope of the line.</p>
<p>What if you have different concepts of what, of where that rise should be</p>
<p>measured from that vary within the theory that are endogenous to the theory.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what gauge theory is.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>We have a video here, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to use my phone.</p>
<p>If I want to measure my hand and its slope, this is my attempt to</p>
<p>measure it using standard calculus.</p>
<p>In other words, the reference level is apparently flat and I measure the</p>
<p>rise above that phone using my hand.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>If I want to use gauge theory, it means I can do this or I can do that, or</p>
<p>I can do this, or I can do this, or I could do what I did from the beginning.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>At some level, that&rsquo;s what gauge theory is.</p>
<p>Now that is an act.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ve never heard anyone describe it that way.</p>
<p>So while the community may say, well, who is this guy and why does he</p>
<p>have the right to talk in public?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m waiting for somebody to jump out of the woodwork and say, you know,</p>
<p>Eric&rsquo;s whole shtick about rulers and protractors, uh, leading to a derivative.</p>
<p>Derivatives are measured as rise over run above reference level.</p>
<p>The reference levels don&rsquo;t fit together.</p>
<p>Like I go through this whole shtick in order to make it accessible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard anyone say it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to make Prometheus would like to discuss fire with everybody else.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to just say one thing to close out the earlier line, which is what I</p>
<p>think we should have continued with.</p>
<p>When you take the naturally occurring spinners, the unadorned spinners, the</p>
<p>naked spinners, not on this 14 dimensional manifold, but on something very closely</p>
<p>tied to it, which I&rsquo;ve called the chimeric tangent bundle, that is the object</p>
<p>which stands in for the thing that should have had length and angle on it,</p>
<p>but just missed.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>When you take that object and you form spinners on that and you don&rsquo;t adorn them.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re still in the single origin story.</p>
<p>You get very large spin oriel objects upstairs on this 14 dimensional world.</p>
<p>Why 14, which is part of the observers.</p>
<p>When you pull that information back from Y 14 down to X four, it miraculously</p>
<p>looks like the adorned spinners, the festoon spinners, the spinners that</p>
<p>we play with in ordinary reality.</p>
<p>In other words, the 14 dimensional world looks like a four dimensional world</p>
<p>plus a 10 dimensional compliment.</p>
<p>So 10 plus four equals 14, that 10 dimensional compliment, which is called</p>
<p>a normal bundle, generates spin properties, internal quantum numbers that look like</p>
<p>the things that give our, our particles personality that make let&rsquo;s say up quarks</p>
<p>and down quarks charged by negative one third or plus two thirds, you know, that</p>
<p>kind of stuff, or whether or not, you know, some quarks feel the weak side.</p>
<p>Quarks feel the weak force and other quarks do not.</p>
<p>So the X four generates Y 14 Y 14 generates something called the chimeric</p>
<p>tangent bundle chimeric tangent bundle generates unadorned spinners.</p>
<p>The unadorned spinners get pulled back from 14 down to four where they</p>
<p>look like adorned spinners.</p>
<p>And we have the right number of them.</p>
<p>You thought you needed three.</p>
<p>You only got two, but then something else that you&rsquo;d never seen before</p>
<p>broke apart on this journey and it broke into another copy of the thing that you</p>
<p>already have two copies of one piece of that thing broke off.</p>
<p>So now you have two generations plus an imposter third generation, which is, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know why we never talk about this possibility in regular physics.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got a bunch of stuff that we haven&rsquo;t seen, which has descriptions.</p>
<p>So people always say, does it make any falsifiable predictions?</p>
<p>Yes, it does.</p>
<p>It says that the matter that you should be seeing, um, next has particular</p>
<p>properties that can be read off like, like a weak ISIS spin, weak hypercharge,</p>
<p>like the responsiveness to the strong force.</p>
<p>The one I can&rsquo;t tell you is what energy scale it would happen at.</p>
<p>So you would, if you can&rsquo;t say if those characteristics can be</p>
<p>detected with the current, but it may be that somebody else can.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a physicist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a quantum field theorist.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know how you would do that.</p>
<p>The hope for me is that there&rsquo;s some simple explanations for all of it.</p>
<p>Like, should we have a drink?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re having fun.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m trying to have fun with you.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a bunch of fun things to talk about here.</p>
<p>Anyway, that was how I got what I thought you wanted, which is,</p>
<p>if you think about the fermions as the artists and the bosons as the brushes</p>
<p>and the paint, what I told you is that&rsquo;s how we get the artists.</p>
<p>What are the open questions for you in this?</p>
<p>What were the challenges?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not done.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s things that I would like to have in better order.</p>
<p>So a lot of people will say, see, if you&rsquo;re going to do this, you have to</p>
<p>say, see, the reason I hesitate on this is I just have a totally different</p>
<p>view than the community.</p>
<p>So for example, I believe that general relativity began in 1913</p>
<p>with Einstein and Grossman.</p>
<p>Now that was the first of like four major papers in this line of thinking.</p>
<p>To most physicists, general relativity happened when Einstein produced, uh,</p>
<p>a divergence free, um, gradient, which turned out to be the gradient of the,</p>
<p>of the so called Hilbert or Einstein Hilbert action.</p>
<p>And from my perspective, that wasn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>This is that it began when Einstein said, look, this is about, um, differential</p>
<p>geometry and it&rsquo;s the final answer is going to look like a curvature tensor</p>
<p>on one side and matter and energy on the other side.</p>
<p>And that was enough.</p>
<p>And then he published a wrong version of it where it was the Ricci tensor,</p>
<p>not the Einstein tensor.</p>
<p>Then he corrected the reach, the Ricci tensor to make it into the Einstein</p>
<p>tensor, then he corrected that to add a cosmological constant.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stand that the community thinks in those terms.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some things about which, like there&rsquo;s a question about</p>
<p>which contraction do I use?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an Einstein contraction.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a Ricci contraction.</p>
<p>They both go between the same spaces.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what I should do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure which contraction I should choose.</p>
<p>This is called a shiab operator for ship in a bottle and my stuff.</p>
<p>You have this big platform in many ways that inspires people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>curiosity about physics and mathematics.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Now, and I&rsquo;m one of those people and, but then you start using a lot of words</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t understand and, or like I might know them, but I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s unclear to me, if I&rsquo;m supposed to be listening to those words, or if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, if this is one of those technical things that&rsquo;s intended for</p>
<p>a very small community, or if I&rsquo;m supposed to actually take those words and start,</p>
<p>you know, a multi year study, not, not a serious study, but a, the community</p>
<p>study, but the kind of study when you, you&rsquo;re interested in learning about</p>
<p>machine learning, for example, or any kind of discipline, that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little bit confused.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve, you&rsquo;ve speak beautifully about ideas.</p>
<p>You often reveal the beauty in math, in geometry, and I&rsquo;m unclear in what</p>
<p>are the steps I should be taking.</p>
<p>I, I&rsquo;m curious, how can I explore?</p>
<p>How can I play with something?</p>
<p>How can I play with these ideas?</p>
<p>And, and, and enjoy the beauty of not necessarily understanding the</p>
<p>depth of the theory that you&rsquo;re presenting, but start to share in the</p>
<p>beauty, as opposed to sharing and enjoying the beauty of just the way,</p>
<p>the passion with which you speak, which is in itself fun to listen to, but</p>
<p>also starting to be able to understand some aspects of this theory that I can</p>
<p>enjoy it to, and start to build an intuition, what the heck we&rsquo;re even</p>
<p>talking about, because you&rsquo;re basically saying we need to throw a lot of our</p>
<p>ideas of, of views of the universe out.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying to find accessible ways in, not in this conversation.</p>
<p>No, I appreciate that.</p>
<p>So one of the things that I&rsquo;ve done is I&rsquo;ve, I&rsquo;ve picked on one</p>
<p>paragraph from Edward Witten, and I said, this is the paragraph.</p>
<p>If I could only take one paragraph with me, this is the one I&rsquo;d take.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost all in prose, not an equation.</p>
<p>And he says, look, this is, this is our knowledge of the</p>
<p>universe at its deepest level.</p>
<p>And he was writing this during the 1980s.</p>
<p>And he has three separate points that constitute our deepest knowledge.</p>
<p>And those three points refer to equations, one to the Einstein field</p>
<p>equation, one to the Dirac equation, and one to the Yang Mills Maxwell equation.</p>
<p>Now, one thing I would do is take a look at that paragraph and say, okay,</p>
<p>what do these three lines mean?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a finite amount of verbiage.</p>
<p>You can write down every word that you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And you can say, what do I think done now?</p>
<p>Young man.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a beautiful wall in Stony Brook, New York built by someone</p>
<p>who I know you will interview named Jim Simons and Jim Simons.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not the artist, but he&rsquo;s the guy who funded it.</p>
<p>World&rsquo;s greatest hedge fund manager.</p>
<p>And on that wall contain the three equations that Witten</p>
<p>refers to in that paragraph.</p>
<p>And so that is the transmission from the paragraph or graph to the wall.</p>
<p>Now that wall needs an owner&rsquo;s manual, which Roger Penrose has written</p>
<p>called the road to reality.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s call that the tome.</p>
<p>So this is the subject of the so called graph wall tome project that is going</p>
<p>on in our discord server and our general group around the portal community, which</p>
<p>is how do you take something that purports in one paragraph to say what the deepest</p>
<p>understanding man has of the universe in which he lives, it&rsquo;s memorialized on a</p>
<p>wall, which nobody knows about, which is an incredibly gorgeous piece of, uh, of</p>
<p>art.</p>
<p>And that was written up in a book, which is, has been written for no man.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe it&rsquo;s for a woman.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but no, no one should be able to read this book because either</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a professional and you know, a lot of this book, in which case it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>a refresher to see how Roger thinks about these things, or you don&rsquo;t even know that</p>
<p>this book is a self contained, uh, invitation to understanding our deepest</p>
<p>nature.</p>
<p>So I would say find yourself in the graph wall tome transmission sequence and join</p>
<p>the graph wall tome project if that&rsquo;s of interest.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>Uh, now just to linger on a little longer, what kind of journey do you</p>
<p>see geometric community taking?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the thing is that.</p>
<p>First of all, the professional community has to get very angry and outraged and</p>
<p>they have to work through their feeling that this is nonsense.</p>
<p>This is bullshit or like, no, wait a minute.</p>
<p>This is really cool.</p>
<p>Actually, I need some clarification over here.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s going to be some sort of weird coming back together process.</p>
<p>Are you already hearing murmurings of that?</p>
<p>It was very funny.</p>
<p>Officially I&rsquo;ve seen very little.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s perhaps happening quietly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You, you often talk about, we need to get off this planet.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Can I try to sneak up on that by asking what in your kind of view is the</p>
<p>difference, the gap between the science of it, the theory and the actual</p>
<p>engineering of building something that leverages the theory to do something?</p>
<p>Like how big is that?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Gap.</p>
<p>I mean, if you have 10 extra dimensions to play with that are the rules of</p>
<p>protractors of the world themselves, can you gain access to those dimensions?</p>
<p>Do you have a hunch?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get ahead of myself because you have to appreciate, I can</p>
<p>have hunches and I can, I can jaw off.</p>
<p>But one of the ways that I&rsquo;m succeeding in this world is to not bow down to my</p>
<p>professional communities nor to ignore them.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m actually in the middle of a world where I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to ignore them, like I&rsquo;m actually interested in the criticism.</p>
<p>I just want to denature it so that it&rsquo;s not mostly interpersonal and irrelevant.</p>
<p>I believe that they don&rsquo;t want me to speculate and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need to speculate about this.</p>
<p>I can simply say I&rsquo;m open to the idea that it may have engineering prospects</p>
<p>and it may be a death sentence.</p>
<p>We may find out that there&rsquo;s not enough new here that even if it were right, that</p>
<p>there would be nothing new to do.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t tell you that&rsquo;s what you mean by death sentences.</p>
<p>There would not be exciting breakthroughs.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be terrible if you couldn&rsquo;t, like you can do new things in an</p>
<p>Einsteinian world that you couldn&rsquo;t do in a Newtonian world, right?</p>
<p>You know, like you have twin paradoxes or Lorentz contraction of length or</p>
<p>any one of a number of new cool things happen in relativity theory</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t happen for Newton.</p>
<p>What if there wasn&rsquo;t new stuff to do at the next and final level?</p>
<p>Yeah, that would be quite sad.</p>
<p>Let me ask a silly question, but we&rsquo;ll say it with a straight face.</p>
<p>Impossible.</p>
<p>So let me mention Elon Musk.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about he&rsquo;s more, you&rsquo;re more on the physics theory side</p>
<p>of things, he&rsquo;s more on the physics engineering side of things in terms of</p>
<p>SpaceX efforts, what do you think of his efforts to, uh, get off this planet?</p>
<p>Well, I think he&rsquo;s the other guy who&rsquo;s semi serious about getting off this planet.</p>
<p>I think there are two of us who are semi serious about getting off the planet.</p>
<p>What do you think about his methodology and yours when you look at them?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t, and I don&rsquo;t want to be against you because like I was so excited that like</p>
<p>your top video was Ray Kurzweil and then I did your podcast and we had some</p>
<p>chemistry, so it zoomed up and I thought, okay, I&rsquo;m going to beat Ray Kurzweil.</p>
<p>So just as I&rsquo;m coming up on Ray Kurzweil, you&rsquo;re like, and now Alex Fridman</p>
<p>special Elon Musk and he blew me out of the water.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to be petty about it.</p>
<p>I want to say that I don&rsquo;t, but I am.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the funny part.</p>
<p>Um, he&rsquo;s not taking enough risk.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s trying to get us to Mars.</p>
<p>Imagine that he got us to Mars, the moon, and we&rsquo;ll throw in Titan and nowhere</p>
<p>good enough, the diversification level is too low.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a compatibility.</p>
<p>First of all, I don&rsquo;t think Elon is serious about Mars.</p>
<p>I think Elon is using Mars as a, as a narrative, as a story, as a dream to</p>
<p>make the moon jealous to make the, uh,</p>
<p>uh, I think he&rsquo;s using it as a story to organize us, to reacquaint ourselves</p>
<p>with our need for space, our need to get off this planet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a concrete thing.</p>
<p>He shown that, um, many people think that he&rsquo;s shown that he&rsquo;s the most</p>
<p>brilliant and capable person on the planet.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what he showed.</p>
<p>I think he showed that the rest of us have forgotten our capabilities.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s like the only guy who has still kept the faith and is like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s wrong with you people?</p>
<p>So you think the lesson we should draw from Elon Musk is there&rsquo;s, uh, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a capable person within, within a lot of us, Elon makes sense to me in what way</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing, what any sensible person should do.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying incredible things and he&rsquo;s partially succeeding, partially failing</p>
<p>to try to solve the obvious problems before, you know, when he comes up with</p>
<p>things like, uh, you know, I got it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll come up with a battery company, but batteries aren&rsquo;t sexy.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll, we&rsquo;ll make a car around it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, great, you know, or, um, any one of a number of things.</p>
<p>Elon is behaving like a sane person and I view everyone else is insane.</p>
<p>And my feeling is, is that we really have to get off this planet.</p>
<p>We have to get out of this.</p>
<p>We have to get out of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>To linger on a little bit.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s a physics problem or an engineering problem?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a cowardice problem.</p>
<p>I think that we&rsquo;re afraid that we had 400 hitters of the mind, like Einstein</p>
<p>and Dirac and that, that era is done.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re just sort of copy editors.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s some of it money, like if we become brave enough to go outside the</p>
<p>solar system, can we afford to financially?</p>
<p>Well, I think that that&rsquo;s not really the issue.</p>
<p>The issue is look what Elon did well, he amassed a lot of money and then he,</p>
<p>you know, he plowed it back in and he spun, spun the wheel and he made more</p>
<p>money and now he&rsquo;s got F you money.</p>
<p>Now the problem is, is that a lot of the people who have F you money are not</p>
<p>people whose middle finger you ever want to see.</p>
<p>I want to see Elon&rsquo;s middle finger.</p>
<p>I want to see what he&rsquo;s doing by that.</p>
<p>Or like when you say, fuck it, I&rsquo;m going to do the biggest possible.</p>
<p>Do whatever the fuck you want, right?</p>
<p>Fuck you.</p>
<p>Fuck anything that gets in his way that he can afford to push out of his way.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying he&rsquo;s not actually even doing that enough.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m he&rsquo;s not going, please.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go.</p>
<p>Elon&rsquo;s doing fine with his money.</p>
<p>I just want him to enjoy himself, have the most, you know, Dionysian, but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying Mars is playing it safe.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t know how to do anything else.</p>
<p>He knows rockets and he might know some physics at a fundamental level.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I guess, okay, just, let me just go right back to how much physics do you really,</p>
<p>how much brilliant breakthrough ideas on the physics side do you</p>
<p>need to get off this planet?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know whether like in my most optimistic dream, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>whether my stuff gets us out of this.</p>
<p>Like in my most optimistic dream, I don&rsquo;t know whether my stuff gets us off the</p>
<p>planet, but it&rsquo;s hope it&rsquo;s hope that there&rsquo;s a more fundamental theory that</p>
<p>we can access that we don&rsquo;t need.</p>
<p>Um, you know, whose elegance and beauty will suggest that this is probably</p>
<p>the way the universe goes.</p>
<p>Like you have to say this weird thing, which is this, I believe, and this,</p>
<p>I believe is a very dangerous statement, but this, I believe, I believe that my</p>
<p>theory, um, points the way now, Elon might or might not be able to access my</p>
<p>theory.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what he knows, but keep in mind, why are we all so focused on Elon?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really weird.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of creepy too.</p>
<p>Why he&rsquo;s just the person who&rsquo;s just asking the, the obvious questions</p>
<p>and doing whatever he can, but he makes sense to me.</p>
<p>You see Craig Venter makes sense to me.</p>
<p>Jim Watson makes sense to me, but we&rsquo;re focusing on Elon.</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s somehow is rare.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the weird thing.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;ve come up with a system that eliminates all Elon from our pipeline</p>
<p>and Elon somehow, uh, snuck through when they weren&rsquo;t quality adjusting</p>
<p>everything, you know?</p>
<p>And this, this idea of, uh, of disc, right?</p>
<p>Distributed idea suppression complex.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is that what&rsquo;s bringing the Elans of the world down?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s so funny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, he&rsquo;s asking Joe Rogan, like, is that a joint, you know, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>well, what, what will happen if I smoke it?</p>
<p>What will happen to the stock price?</p>
<p>What will happen if I scratch myself in public?</p>
<p>What will happen if I say what I think about Thailand or COVID or who knows what?</p>
<p>And everybody&rsquo;s like, don&rsquo;t say that, say this, go do this, go do that.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s crazy making, it&rsquo;s absolutely crazy making.</p>
<p>And if you think about what we put through people through, um, we, we</p>
<p>need to get people who can use FU money, the FU money they need to insulate</p>
<p>themselves from all of the people who know better, because the, the, my</p>
<p>nightmare is, is that why did we only get one Elon?</p>
<p>What if we were supposed to have thousands and thousands of Elans?</p>
<p>And the weird thing is like, this is all that remains you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>at like OB one and Yoda, and it&rsquo;s like, this is the only, this is all that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>left after X, uh, order 66 has been executed.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing that&rsquo;s really upsetting to me is we used, we</p>
<p>used to have Elon&rsquo;s five deep.</p>
<p>And then we could talk about Elon in the context of his cohort.</p>
<p>But this is like, if you were to see a giraffe in the Arctic with no</p>
<p>trees around, you&rsquo;d think why the long neck, what a strange sight, you know?</p>
<p>You know, how do we get more Elans?</p>
<p>How do we change these?</p>
<p>So I think the use, so we know MIT and Harvard, so maybe returning to our</p>
<p>previous conversation, my sense is that the Elans of the world are supposed</p>
<p>to come from MIT and Harvard, right?</p>
<p>And how do you change?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s think of one that MIT sort of killed.</p>
<p>Have any names in mind?</p>
<p>Aaron Schwartz leaps to my mind.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Are we MIT supposed to shield the Aaron Schwartz&rsquo;s from, I don&rsquo;t know, journal</p>
<p>publishers, or are we supposed to help the journal publishers so that we can</p>
<p>throw 35 year sentences in his face or whatever it is that we did that depressed</p>
<p>him? Okay.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s my point.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I want MIT to go back to being the home of Aaron Schwartz, and if you want to</p>
<p>send Aaron Schwartz to a state where he&rsquo;s looking at 35 years in prison or</p>
<p>something like that, you are my sworn enemy.</p>
<p>You are not MIT.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You are the traitors, uh, irresponsible, middle brow, pencil pushing green</p>
<p>eyeshade fool that needs to not be in the seat at the, at the presidency of MIT</p>
<p>period, the end, get the fuck out of there and let one of our people sit in that</p>
<p>chair.</p>
<p>And the thing that you&rsquo;ve articulated is that the people in those chairs are not</p>
<p>the way they are because they&rsquo;re evil or somehow morally compromised is that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just the, that&rsquo;s the distributed nature is that there&rsquo;s some kind of aspect of</p>
<p>the system that people who wed themselves to the system, they adapt every instinct.</p>
<p>And the fact is, is that they&rsquo;re not going to be on Joe Rogan smoking a blunt.</p>
<p>Let me ask a silly question.</p>
<p>Do you think institutions generally just tend to become that?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>We get some of the institutions, we get Caltech.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re supposed to have.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re supposed to have Caltech.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re supposed to have a read.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re supposed to have deep springs.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re supposed to have MIT.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re supposed to have a part of Harvard.</p>
<p>And when the sharp elbow crowd comes after the shelf, sharp, uh, mind crowd,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re supposed to break those sharp elbows and say, don&rsquo;t come around here</p>
<p>again.</p>
<p>So what are the weapons that the sharp minds are supposed to use in our modern</p>
<p>day?</p>
<p>So to reclaim MIT, what, what is the, what&rsquo;s the future?</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>First of all, assume that this is being seen at MIT.</p>
<p>Hey everybody is okay.</p>
<p>Hey everybody, try to remember who you are.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the guys who put the police car on top of the great dump.</p>
<p>You guys came up with the great breast of knowledge.</p>
<p>You created a Tetris game in the green building.</p>
<p>Now, what is your problem?</p>
<p>Is your problem they killed one of your own.</p>
<p>You should make their life a living hell.</p>
<p>You should be the ones who keep the mayor memory of Aaron Schwartz alive and all</p>
<p>of those hackers and all of those mutants, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s either our place or it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And if we have to throw 12 more pianos off of the</p>
<p>roof, right?</p>
<p>If Harold Edgerton was taking those photographs, you know,</p>
<p>uh, with slow mo back in the forties,</p>
<p>if Noam Chomsky is on your faculty,</p>
<p>what the hell is wrong with you kids?</p>
<p>You are the most creative and insightful people and you can&rsquo;t figure out how to</p>
<p>defend Aaron Schwartz. That&rsquo;s on you guys.</p>
<p>So some of that is giving more power to the young, like you said,</p>
<p>no, it&rsquo;s taking power from taking power from the feeble and the middle</p>
<p>Brown. Yeah. But how do you, what is the mechanism to me?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. You, you have some nine volt batteries, copper wire.</p>
<p>I, uh, I tend to, do you have a capacitor?</p>
<p>I tend to believe you have to create an alternative and, uh,</p>
<p>make the alternative so much better that it makes MIT obsolete unless</p>
<p>they change. And that&rsquo;s what forces change. So as opposed to somehow,</p>
<p>okay, so use projection mapping, what&rsquo;s projection mapping,</p>
<p>where you take some complicated edifice and you map all of its planes.</p>
<p>And then you actually project some unbelievable graphics,</p>
<p>re skinning a building, let&rsquo;s say at night. That&rsquo;s right. Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p>So you want to do some graffiti art with like basically want to hack the system.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m saying, look, listen to me. Yeah. We&rsquo;re smarter than they are.</p>
<p>And they, you know what they say? They say things like,</p>
<p>okay, I think we need some geeks. Get me two PhDs.</p>
<p>Right. You treat PhDs like that. That&rsquo;s a bad move.</p>
<p>Because PhDs are capable and we act like our job is to peel</p>
<p>grapes for our betters.</p>
<p>Yeah. That&rsquo;s a strange thing. And I,</p>
<p>I you speak about it very eloquently is how we treat basically</p>
<p>the greatest minds in the world, which is like at their prime,</p>
<p>which is PhD students like that. We pay them nothing.</p>
<p>Uh, I&rsquo;m done with it. Yeah. Right. We got to take what&rsquo;s ours.</p>
<p>So, so take back MIT, become ungovernable,</p>
<p>become ungovernable. And by the way, when you become ungovernable,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do it by throwing food.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do it by pouring salt on the lawn, like a jerk,</p>
<p>do it through brilliance, because what you Caltech and MIT can do,</p>
<p>and maybe Rensselaer Polytechnic or Worcester Polytech, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Lehigh. God damn it. What&rsquo;s wrong with you technical people?</p>
<p>You act like you&rsquo;re a servant class.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear to me how you reclaim it except with brilliance,</p>
<p>like you said. Uh,</p>
<p>but to me that the way you reclaim it with brilliance is to go outside the</p>
<p>system.</p>
<p>Aaron Schwartz came from the Elon Musk class.</p>
<p>What are you guys going to do about it? Right.</p>
<p>The super capable people need to flex,</p>
<p>need to be individual. They need to stop giving away all their power to,</p>
<p>you know, a zeitgeist or a community or this or that you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not indoor cats. You&rsquo;re outdoor cats. Go be outdoor cats.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;re going to see this, this kind of one asking me, you know,</p>
<p>before, like what about the world war II generation? Right.</p>
<p>Oh,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to say is that there&rsquo;s a technical revolt coming here&rsquo;s you want</p>
<p>to talk about it, but I&rsquo;m trying to lead it. I&rsquo;m trying to see,</p>
<p>no, you&rsquo;re not trying to lead it. I&rsquo;m trying to get a blueprint here.</p>
<p>All right, Lex. Yeah.</p>
<p>How angry are you about our country pretending that you and I can&rsquo;t actually do</p>
<p>technical subjects so that they need an army of, uh,</p>
<p>kids coming in from four countries in Asia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about the four countries in Asia. It&rsquo;s not about those kids.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about lying about us that we don&rsquo;t care enough about science and</p>
<p>technology that we&rsquo;re incapable of it as if we don&rsquo;t have Chinese and Russians</p>
<p>and Russians and Koreans and Croatians. Like we&rsquo;ve got everybody here.</p>
<p>The only reason you&rsquo;re looking outside is,</p>
<p>is that you want to hire cheap people from the family business because you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to pass the family business on. And you know what?</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t really build the family business. It&rsquo;s not yours to decide.</p>
<p>You the boomers and you the silent generation, you did your bit,</p>
<p>but you also fouled a lot of stuff up and you&rsquo;re custodians.</p>
<p>You are caretakers. You were supposed to hand something.</p>
<p>What you did instead was to gorge yourself on cheap foreign labor,</p>
<p>which you then held up as being much more brilliant than your own children,</p>
<p>which was never true.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m trying to understand how we create a better system without anger,</p>
<p>without revolution, not, not,</p>
<p>not by kissing and hugs and, and,</p>
<p>but by any,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand within MIT what the mechanism of building a better MIT is.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to pay Elsevier. Aaron Schwartz was right.</p>
<p>JSTOR is an abomination.</p>
<p>But why, who within MIT, who within institutions is going to do that?</p>
<p>When just like you said,</p>
<p>the people who are running the show are more senior.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, get Frank Wilczek to speak out.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re, it&rsquo;s basically individuals that step up. I mean,</p>
<p>one of the surprising things about Elon is that one person can inspire so</p>
<p>much.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got academic freedom. It just comes from money.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with that. That you think money. Okay.</p>
<p>So yes, certainly. Sorry.</p>
<p>And testicles. Yes.</p>
<p>I think that testicles are more important than money or guts.</p>
<p>I think I do agree with you.</p>
<p>You speak about this a lot that because the money in academic institutions</p>
<p>has been so constrained that people are misbehaving and horrible.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that if we reverse that and give a huge amount of money,</p>
<p>people will all of a sudden behave well. I think it also takes guts.</p>
<p>No, you need to give people security. Security. Yes.</p>
<p>Like you need to know that you have a job on Monday when on</p>
<p>Friday you say, I&rsquo;m not so sure I really love diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>And somebody is like, wait, what? You didn&rsquo;t love diversity?</p>
<p>We had a statement on diversity and you wouldn&rsquo;t sign.</p>
<p>Are you against the inclusion part or are you against diverse?</p>
<p>Do you just not like people like you?</p>
<p>Like actually that has nothing to do with anything.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making this into something that it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to sign your goddamn stupid statement and get out of my lab,</p>
<p>right? Get out of my lab. It all begins from the middle finger.</p>
<p>Get out of my lab. The administrators need to find other</p>
<p>work.</p>
<p>Yeah. Listen, I agree with you and I hope to seek your advice</p>
<p>and wisdom as we change this, because I&rsquo;d love to see&hellip;</p>
<p>I will visit you in prison if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re asking.</p>
<p>I have no&hellip; I think prison is great.</p>
<p>You get a lot of reading done and good working out.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask something I brought up before is the Nietzsche quote</p>
<p>of beware that when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster.</p>
<p>For when you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss gazes into you.</p>
<p>Are you worried that your focus on the flaws in the system</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve just been talking about has damaged your mind</p>
<p>or the part of your mind that&rsquo;s able to see the beauty in the world</p>
<p>in the system that because you have so sharply been able to see</p>
<p>the flaws in the system, you can no longer step back and appreciate its beauty?</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;m the one who&rsquo;s trying to get the institutions to save themselves</p>
<p>by getting rid of their inhabitants, but leaving the institution</p>
<p>like a neutron bomb that removes the unworkable leadership class,</p>
<p>but leaves the structures.</p>
<p>So the leadership class is really the problem.</p>
<p>The leadership class is the problem.</p>
<p>But the individual, like the professors, the individual scholars&hellip;</p>
<p>No, the professors are going to have to go back into training</p>
<p>to remember how to be professors.</p>
<p>Like people are cowards at the moment because if they&rsquo;re not cowards,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re unemployed.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s one of the disappointing things I&rsquo;ve encountered is to me, tenure&hellip;</p>
<p>But nobody has tenure now.</p>
<p>Whether they do or not, they certainly don&rsquo;t have the kind of character</p>
<p>and fortitude that I was hoping to see.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;d be gone.</p>
<p>See, you&rsquo;re dreaming about the people who used to live at MIT.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re dreaming about the previous inhabitants of your university.</p>
<p>And if you looked at somebody like, you know, Isidore Singer is very old.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what state he&rsquo;s in, but that guy was absolutely the real deal.</p>
<p>And if you look at Noam Chomsky, tell me that Noam Chomsky has been muzzled.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now, what I&rsquo;m trying to get at is you&rsquo;re talking about younger energetic people,</p>
<p>but those people&hellip;</p>
<p>Like when I say something like, I&rsquo;m against&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m for inclusion and I&rsquo;m for diversity, but I&rsquo;m against diversity and inclusion TM,</p>
<p>like the movement.</p>
<p>Well, I couldn&rsquo;t say that if I was a professor.</p>
<p>Oh my God, he&rsquo;s against our sacred document.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, in that kind of a world, do you want to know how many things I don&rsquo;t agree with you on?</p>
<p>Like we could go on for days and days and days, all the nonsense that you&rsquo;ve parroted inside of the institution.</p>
<p>Any sane person like has no need for it.</p>
<p>They have no want or desire.</p>
<p>Do you think you have to have some patience for nonsense when many people work together in a system?</p>
<p>How long has string theory gone on for?</p>
<p>And how long have I been patient?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking about&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a limit to patience.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about like 36 years of modern nonsense and string theory.</p>
<p>So you can do like eight to 10 years, but not more.</p>
<p>I can do 40 minutes.</p>
<p>This is 36 years.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve done that over two hours already.</p>
<p>No, but I appreciate it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s been 36 years of nonsense since the anomaly cancellation in string theory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what are you talking about about patience?</p>
<p>I mean, Lex, you&rsquo;re not even acting like yourself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to stay in the system.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to see if perhaps&hellip; So my hope is that the system just has a few assholes in it,</p>
<p>which you highlight, and the fundamentals of the system are broken.</p>
<p>Because if the fundamentals of the systems are broken, then I just don&rsquo;t see a way for MIT to succeed.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t see how young people take over MIT.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how&hellip;</p>
<p>By inspiring us.</p>
<p>You know, the great part about being at MIT, like when you saw the genius in these pranks,</p>
<p>the heart, the irreverence, it&rsquo;s like, don&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>We were talking about Tom Lehrer the last time.</p>
<p>Tom Lehrer was as naughty as the day is long.</p>
<p>Agreed?</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>Was he also a genius?</p>
<p>Was he well spoken?</p>
<p>Was he highly cultured?</p>
<p>He was so talented, so intellectual that he could just make fart jokes morning,</p>
<p>noon and night.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, in part, the right to make fart jokes, the right to, for example, put a functioning</p>
<p>phone booth that was ringing on top of the great dome at MIT has to do with we are such</p>
<p>bad asses that we can actually do this stuff.</p>
<p>Well, don&rsquo;t tell me about it anymore.</p>
<p>Go break the law.</p>
<p>Go break the law in a way that inspires us and makes us not want to prosecute you.</p>
<p>Break the law in a way that lets us know that you&rsquo;re calling us out on our bullshit, that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re filled with love, and that our technical talent has not gone to sleep, it&rsquo;s not incapable.</p>
<p>And if the idea is that you&rsquo;re going to dig a moat around the university and fill it with</p>
<p>tiger sharks, that&rsquo;s awesome because I don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;re going to do it.</p>
<p>But if you actually manage to do that, I&rsquo;m not going to prosecute you under a reckless</p>
<p>endangerment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautifully put.</p>
<p>I hope those, first of all, they&rsquo;ll listen, I hope young people at MIT will take over</p>
<p>in this kind of way.</p>
<p>In the introduction to your podcast episode on Jeffrey Epstein, you give to me a really</p>
<p>moving story, but unfortunately for me, too brief, about your experience with a therapist</p>
<p>and a lasting terror that permeated your mind.</p>
<p>Can you go there, can you tell?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I mean, I appreciate what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>I said it obliquely, I said enough.</p>
<p>There are bad people who cross our paths and the current vogue is to say, oh, I&rsquo;m a survivor,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a victim, I can do anything I want.</p>
<p>This is a broken person and I don&rsquo;t know why I was sent to a broken person as a kid.</p>
<p>And to be honest with you, I also felt like in that story, I say that I was able to say</p>
<p>no and this was like the entire weight of authority and he was misusing his position</p>
<p>and I was also able to say no.</p>
<p>What I couldn&rsquo;t say no to was having him re inflicted in my life.</p>
<p>Right, so you were sent back a second time.</p>
<p>I tried to complain about what had happened and I tried to do it in a way that did not</p>
<p>immediately cause horrific consequences to both this person and myself because we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the tools to deal with sexual misbehavior.</p>
<p>We have nuclear weapons, we don&rsquo;t have any way of saying this is probably not a good</p>
<p>place or a role for you at this moment as an authority figure and something needs to</p>
<p>be worked on.</p>
<p>So in general, when we see somebody who is misbehaving in that way, our immediate instinct</p>
<p>is to treat the person as Satan and we understand why.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want our children to be at risk.</p>
<p>Now I personally believe that I fell down on the job and did not call out the Jeffrey</p>
<p>Epstein thing early enough because I was terrified of what Jeffrey Epstein represents and this</p>
<p>recapitulated the old terror trying to tell the world this therapist is out of control.</p>
<p>And when I said that, the world responded by saying, well, you have two appointments</p>
<p>booked and you have to go for the second one.</p>
<p>So I got re inflicted into this office on this person who was now convinced that I was</p>
<p>about to tear down his career and his reputation and might have been on the verge of suicide</p>
<p>for all I know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But he was very, very angry and he was furious with me that I had breached a sacred confidence</p>
<p>of his office.</p>
<p>What kind of ripple effects does that have?</p>
<p>Has that had to the rest of your life?</p>
<p>The absurdity and the cruelty of that?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no sense to it.</p>
<p>Well, see, this is the thing people don&rsquo;t really grasp, I think there&rsquo;s an academic</p>
<p>who I got to know many years ago, um, named Jennifer fried, who has a theory of betrayal,</p>
<p>which she calls institutional betrayal.</p>
<p>And her gambit is, is that when you were betrayed by an institution that is sort of like a fiduciary</p>
<p>or a parental obligation to take care of you, that you find yourself in a far different</p>
<p>situation with respect to trauma than if you were betrayed by somebody who&rsquo;s a peer.</p>
<p>And so I think that my, in my situation, um, I kind of repeat a particular dynamic with</p>
<p>authority.</p>
<p>I come in not following all the rules, trying to do some things, not trying to do others,</p>
<p>blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>And then I get into a weird relationship with authority.</p>
<p>And so I have more experience with what I would call institutional betrayal.</p>
<p>Now, the funny part about it is that when you don&rsquo;t have masks or PPE in a influenza</p>
<p>like pandemic and you missing ICU beds and ventilators, that is ubiquitous institutional</p>
<p>betrayal.</p>
<p>So I believe that in a weird way, I was very early, the idea of, and this is like the really</p>
<p>hard concept pervasive or otherwise universal institutional betrayal where all of the institutions</p>
<p>you can count on any hospital to not charge you properly for what their services are.</p>
<p>You can count on no pharmaceutical company to produce the drug that will be maximally</p>
<p>beneficial to the people who take it.</p>
<p>You know that your financial professionals are not simply working in your best interest.</p>
<p>And that issue had to do with the way in which growth left our system.</p>
<p>So I think that the weird thing is, is that this first institutional betrayal by a therapist</p>
<p>left me very open to the idea of, okay, well maybe the schools are bad.</p>
<p>Maybe the hospitals are bad.</p>
<p>Maybe the drug companies are bad.</p>
<p>Maybe our food is off.</p>
<p>Maybe our journalists are not serving journalistic ends.</p>
<p>And that was what allowed me to sort of go all the distance and say, huh, I wonder if</p>
<p>our problem is that something is causing all of our sensemaking institutions to be off.</p>
<p>That was the big insight and that tying that to a single ideology.</p>
<p>What if it&rsquo;s just about growth?</p>
<p>They were all built on growth and now we&rsquo;ve promoted people who are capable of keeping</p>
<p>quiet that their institutions aren&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve, the privileged silent aristocracy, the people who can be counted upon, not to</p>
<p>mention a fire when a raging fire is tearing through a building.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, it&rsquo;s how big of a psychological burden is that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crushing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, it&rsquo;s very comforting to be the parental, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I treasure, I mean, we were just talking about MIT.</p>
<p>We can, until I can intellectualize and agree with everything you&rsquo;re saying, but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a comfort, a warm blanket of being within the institution and up until Aaron Schwartz,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, in other words, now, if I look at the provost and the president as mommy</p>
<p>and daddy, you did what to my big brother?</p>
<p>You did what to our family?</p>
<p>You sold us out in which way?</p>
<p>What secrets left for China?</p>
<p>You hired which workforce?</p>
<p>You did what to my wages?</p>
<p>You took this portion of my grant for what purpose?</p>
<p>You just stole my retirement through a fringe rate.</p>
<p>What did you do?</p>
<p>But can you still, I mean, the thing is about this view you have is it often turns out to</p>
<p>be sadly correct.</p>
<p>Well, this is the thing.</p>
<p>But let me just, in this silly, hopeful thing, do you still have hope in institutions?</p>
<p>Can you within your, psychologically, I&rsquo;m referring not intellectually, because you</p>
<p>have to carry this burden, can you still have a hope within you?</p>
<p>When you sit at home alone and as opposed to seeing the darkness within these institutions,</p>
<p>seeing a hope.</p>
<p>Well, but this is the thing.</p>
<p>I want to confront, not for the purpose of a dust up.</p>
<p>I believe, for example, if you&rsquo;ve heard episode 19, that the best outcome is for Carol Greider</p>
<p>to come forward, as we discussed in episode 19, and say, you know what, I screwed up.</p>
<p>He did call.</p>
<p>He did suggest the experiment.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t understand that it was his theory that was producing it.</p>
<p>I was slow to grasp it.</p>
<p>But my bad.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to pay for this bad choice on my part, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>For the rest of my career, I want to own up, and I want to help make sure that we do what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right with what&rsquo;s left.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one little case within the institution that you would like to see made.</p>
<p>I would like to see MIT very clearly come out and say, Margot O&rsquo;Toole was right when</p>
<p>she said David Baltimore&rsquo;s lab here produced some stuff that was not reproducible with</p>
<p>Teresa Imanishi Kari&rsquo;s research.</p>
<p>I want to see the courageous people.</p>
<p>I would like to see the Aaron Schwartz wing of the computer science department.</p>
<p>Yeah, wouldn&rsquo;t, no, let&rsquo;s think about it.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that be great if we said, you know, an injustice was done and we&rsquo;re going to write</p>
<p>that wrong just as if this was Alan Turing?</p>
<p>Which I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ve righted that wrong.</p>
<p>Well then let&rsquo;s have the Turing Schwartz wing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re starting a new college of computing.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be wonderful to call it the Turing Schwartz wing.</p>
<p>I would like to have the Madame Wu wing of the physics department.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d love to have the Emmy Nerder statue in front of the math department.</p>
<p>I mean, like you want to get excited about actual diversity and inclusion?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s go with our absolute best people who never got theirs because there is structural</p>
<p>bigotry, you know?</p>
<p>But if we don&rsquo;t actually start celebrating the beautiful stuff that we&rsquo;re capable of</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re handed heroes and we fumble them into the trash, what the hell?</p>
<p>I mean, Lex, this is such nonsense.</p>
<p>We just pulling our head out.</p>
<p>You know, on everyone&rsquo;s cecum should be tattooed, if you can read this, you&rsquo;re too close.</p>
<p>Beautifully put and I&rsquo;m a dreamer just like you.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t see as much of the darkness genetically or due to my life experience, but I do share</p>
<p>the hope.</p>
<p>From my teeth, the institution that we care a lot about.</p>
<p>You both do.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And a Harvard institution I don&rsquo;t give a damn about, but you do.</p>
<p>So I love Harvard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>I love Harvard, but Harvard and I have a very difficult relationship.</p>
<p>And part of what, you know, when you love a family that isn&rsquo;t working, I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to trash.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t bring up the name of the president of MIT during the Aaron Schwartz period.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not vengeance.</p>
<p>I want the rot cleared out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to go after human beings.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just like you said with the, with the disc formulation, the individual human beings aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t necessarily carry them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s those chairs that are so powerful that in which they sit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the chairs, not the humans, not the humans without naming names.</p>
<p>Can you tell the story of your struggle during your time at Harvard, maybe in a way that</p>
<p>tells the bigger story of the struggle of young bright minds that are trying to come</p>
<p>up with big, bold ideas within the institutions that we&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>You can start.</p>
<p>I mean, in part, uh, it starts with, uh, coffee with, uh, a couple, uh, of Croatians in the</p>
<p>math department at MIT.</p>
<p>And, um, we used to talk about, um, music and dance and math and physics and love and</p>
<p>all this kind of stuff as Eastern Europeans, uh, love to, and I ate it up and my friend</p>
<p>Gordon, uh, who was, uh, an instructor in the MIT math department when I was a graduate</p>
<p>student at Harvard said to me, I&rsquo;m probably gonna do a bad version of her accent, but</p>
<p>here we go.</p>
<p>It, um, will I see you tomorrow at the secret seminar?</p>
<p>And I said, w what secret seminar, Eric, don&rsquo;t joke.</p>
<p>I said, I&rsquo;m not used to this style of humor.</p>
<p>Then she&rsquo;s Eric, the secret seminar that your advisor is running.</p>
<p>I said, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>Ha ha ha, uh, you know, your advisor is running a secret seminar on this aspect.</p>
<p>I think it was like the churn Simon&rsquo;s invariant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what the topic was again, but she gave me the room number and the time and</p>
<p>she was like not cracking a smile.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never known her to make this kind of a joke.</p>
<p>And I thought this was crazy and I was trying to have an advisor.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want an advisor, but people said you have to have one.</p>
<p>So I took one and I went to this room at like 15 minutes early and there was not a soul</p>
<p>inside it.</p>
<p>It was outside of the math department and it was still in the same building, the science</p>
<p>center at Harvard.</p>
<p>And I sat there and I let five minutes go by, I let seven minutes go by, 10 minutes</p>
<p>go by.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nobody.</p>
<p>I thought, okay, so this was all an elaborate joke.</p>
<p>And then like three minutes to the hour, this graduate student walks in and like sees me</p>
<p>and does a double take.</p>
<p>And then I start to see the professors in geometry and topology start to file in and</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s like very disconcerted that I&rsquo;m in this room.</p>
<p>And finally the person who was supposed to be my advisor walks in to the seminar and</p>
<p>sees me and goes white as a ghost.</p>
<p>And I realized that the secret seminar is true, that the department is conducting a</p>
<p>secret seminar on the exact topic that I&rsquo;m interested in, not telling me about it.</p>
<p>And that these are the reindeer games that the Rudolph&rsquo;s of the department are not invited</p>
<p>to.</p>
<p>And so then I realized, okay, I did not understand it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a parallel department.</p>
<p>And that became the beginning of an incredible odyssey in which I came to understand that</p>
<p>the game that I had been sold about publication, about blind refereeing, about openness and</p>
<p>scientific transmission of information was all a lie.</p>
<p>I came to understand that at the very top, there&rsquo;s a second system that&rsquo;s about closed</p>
<p>meetings and private communications and agreements about citation and publication that the rest</p>
<p>of us don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>And that in large measure, that is the thing that I won&rsquo;t submit to.</p>
<p>And so when you ask me questions like, well, why wouldn&rsquo;t you feel good about, you know,</p>
<p>talking to your critics or why wouldn&rsquo;t you feel the answer is, oh, you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Like if you stay in a nice hotel, you don&rsquo;t realize that there is an entire second structure</p>
<p>inside of that hotel where like there&rsquo;s usually a worker&rsquo;s cafe in a resort complex that isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>available to the people who are staying in the hotel.</p>
<p>And then there are private hallways inside the same hotel that are parallel structures.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I found, which was in essence, just the way you can stay hotels your whole</p>
<p>life and not realize that inside of every hotel is a second structure that you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>supposed to see as the guest.</p>
<p>There is a second structure inside of academics that behaves totally differently with respect</p>
<p>to how people get dinged, how people get their grants taken away, how this person comes to</p>
<p>have that thing named after them.</p>
<p>And by pretending that we&rsquo;re not running a parallel structure, um, I have no patience</p>
<p>for that anymore.</p>
<p>So I got a chance to see how the game, how hard ball is really played at Harvard.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m now eager to play hard ball back with the same people who played hard ball with</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>Let me ask two questions on this.</p>
<p>So one, do you think it&rsquo;s possible, so I call those people assholes, that&rsquo;s the technical</p>
<p>term.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible that that&rsquo;s just not the entire system, but a part of the system?</p>
<p>Sort of that there&rsquo;s, you can navigate, you can swim in the waters and find the groups</p>
<p>of people who do aspire to the openness.</p>
<p>The guy who rescued my phd was one of the people who filed in to the secret seminar.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But are there people outside of this, right?</p>
<p>Is he an asshole?</p>
<p>Well, yes, I was, it was a bad, no, but I&rsquo;m trying to make this point, which is this isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>my failure to correctly map these people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s yours.</p>
<p>You, you have a simplification that isn&rsquo;t going to work.</p>
<p>I think, okay.</p>
<p>If I asked what was the wrong term, I would say lacking of character and what would you</p>
<p>have had these people do?</p>
<p>Why did they do this?</p>
<p>Why have a secret seminar?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the exact dynamics of a secret seminar, but I think the right thing</p>
<p>to do is to, I mean, to see individuals like you, there might be a reason to have a secret</p>
<p>seminar, but they should detect that an individual like you, a brilliant mind who&rsquo;s thinking</p>
<p>about certain ideas could be damaged by this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that they see it that way.</p>
<p>The idea is we&rsquo;re going to sneak food to the children we want to survive.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that that&rsquo;s highly problematic and there should be people within that room.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to say this is the thing, the ball that can&rsquo;t is thrown, but won&rsquo;t be caught.</p>
<p>The problem is they know that most of their children won&rsquo;t survive and they can&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>You mean that the fact that the whole system is underfunded, that they naturally have to</p>
<p>pick favorites.</p>
<p>They live in a world which reached steady state at some level, let&rsquo;s say, you know,</p>
<p>in the early seventies and in that world before that time you have a professor like Norman</p>
<p>Steenrod and you&rsquo;d have 20 children that is graduate students and all of them would go</p>
<p>on to be professors and all of them would want to have 20 children, right?</p>
<p>So you start like taking higher and higher powers of 20 and you see that the system could</p>
<p>not, it&rsquo;s not just about money, the system couldn&rsquo;t survive.</p>
<p>So the way it&rsquo;s supposed to work now is that we should shut down the vast majority of PhD</p>
<p>programs and we should let the small number of truly top places populate, um, mostly teaching</p>
<p>and research departments that aren&rsquo;t PhD producing.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to do that because we use PhD students as a labor force.</p>
<p>So the whole thing has to do with growth, resources, dishonesty, and in that world you</p>
<p>see all of these adaptations to a ruthless world where the key question is where are</p>
<p>we going to bury this huge number of bodies of people who don&rsquo;t work out?</p>
<p>So my problem was I wasn&rsquo;t interested in dying.</p>
<p>So you clearly highlight that there&rsquo;s aspects of the system that are broken, but as an individual,</p>
<p>is your role to, uh, exit the system or just acknowledge that it&rsquo;s a game and win it?</p>
<p>My role is to survive and thrive in the public eye.</p>
<p>In other words, when you have an escapee of the system, like yourself, such as, and that</p>
<p>person says, you know, I wasn&rsquo;t exactly finished, let me show you a bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>Let me show you that, uh, the theory of telomeres never got reported properly.</p>
<p>Let me show you that all of, uh, marginal economics, uh, is supposed to be redone with</p>
<p>a different version of the differential calculus.</p>
<p>Let me show you that you didn&rsquo;t understand the self dual Yang Mills equations correctly</p>
<p>in topology and physics because they&rsquo;re in fact, uh, much more broadly found and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>only the mutations that happen in special dimensions.</p>
<p>There are lots of things to say, but this particular group of people, like if you just</p>
<p>take, where are all the gen X and millennial university presidents?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all, they&rsquo;re all in a holding pattern.</p>
<p>Now where, why in this story, you know, was it of telomeres?</p>
<p>Was it an older professor and a younger graduate student?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this issue of what would be called interference competition.</p>
<p>So for example, orcas try to drown minke whales by covering their blow holes so that they</p>
<p>suffocate because the needed resource is air.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, what do the universities do?</p>
<p>They try to make sure that you can&rsquo;t be viable, that you need them, that you need their grants.</p>
<p>You need to be, uh, zinged with overhead charges or fringe rates or all of the games that the</p>
<p>locals love to play.</p>
<p>Well, my point is, okay, what&rsquo;s the cost of this?</p>
<p>How many people died as a result of these interference competition games?</p>
<p>You know, when you take somebody like Douglas Prasher who did green fluorescent protein</p>
<p>and he drives a shuttle bus, right?</p>
<p>Cause he, his grant runs out and he has to give away all of his research and all of that</p>
<p>research gets a Nobel prize and he gets to drive a shuttle bus for $35,000 a year.</p>
<p>What do you mean by died?</p>
<p>You mean their career, their dreams, their passions?</p>
<p>Yeah, the whole, as an academic, Doug Prasher was dead for a long period of time.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So as a, as a person who&rsquo;s escaped the system, can&rsquo;t you at this, cause you also have in</p>
<p>your mind a powerful theory that may turn out to be a useful, maybe not.</p>
<p>So can&rsquo;t you also play the game enough?</p>
<p>Like with the children, so like publish and, but also if you told me that this would work,</p>
<p>really what I want to do, you see, is I would love to revolutionize a field with an H index</p>
<p>of zero, like we have these proxies that count how many papers you&rsquo;ve written, how cited</p>
<p>are the papers you&rsquo;ve written.</p>
<p>All of this is nonsense.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>What do you mean by field with an H index as your, so a totally new field.</p>
<p>H index is count somehow.</p>
<p>How many papers have you gotten that get so many citations?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say H index undefined, like for example, um, I don&rsquo;t have an advisor for my PhD, but</p>
<p>I have to have an advisor as far as something called the math genealogy project that tracks</p>
<p>who advised who, who advised whom down the line.</p>
<p>So I am my own advisor, which sets up a loop, right?</p>
<p>How many students do I have?</p>
<p>An infinite number.</p>
<p>Um, your descendants, they don&rsquo;t want to have that story.</p>
<p>So I have to be, I have to have formal advisor, Raul bought, and my Wikipedia entry, for example,</p>
<p>says that I was advised by Raul bought, which is not true.</p>
<p>So you get fit into a system that says, well, we have to know what your H index is.</p>
<p>We have to know, um, you know, where are you a professor?</p>
<p>If you want to apply for a grant, it makes all of these assumptions.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m trying to do is in part to show all of this is nonsense.</p>
<p>This is proxy BS that came up in the institutional setting.</p>
<p>And right now it&rsquo;s important for those of us who are still vital, like Elon, it would</p>
<p>be great to have Elon as a professor of physics and engineering.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It seems ridiculous to say, but just as a shot, just as a shot in the arm.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, like it&rsquo;d be great to have Elon at Caltech even one day a week, one day a</p>
<p>month.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, why can&rsquo;t we be in there?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same reason.</p>
<p>Well, why can&rsquo;t you be on the view?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t you be on bill Martin?</p>
<p>We need to know what you&rsquo;re going to do before we take you on the show on the show.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t want to tell you what I&rsquo;m going to do.</p>
<p>Do you think you need to be able to dance the dance a little bit?</p>
<p>I can dance the dance fun to be on the view.</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>So you can, yeah, you do.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not, I can do that.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where the place that it goes south is there like a set of questions that get</p>
<p>you into this more adversarial stuff.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve in fact asked some of those more adversarial questions, the setting, and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not things that are necessarily aggressive, but they&rsquo;re things that are making assumptions.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So when you make a, I have a question is like, you know, Lex, are you avoiding your critics?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s just like, okay, well why did you?</p>
<p>You frame that that way.</p>
<p>Or the next question would be like, um, do you think that you should have a special exemption</p>
<p>and that you should have the right to break rules and everyone else should have to follow</p>
<p>them?</p>
<p>Like that question I find innervating.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really come out of anything meaningful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like we feel we&rsquo;re supposed to ask that of the other person to show that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not captured by their madness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the real question you want to ask me.</p>
<p>If you want to get really excited about this, you want to ask, do you think this thing is</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Weirdly I do.</p>
<p>Do you think that it&rsquo;s going to be immediately seen to be right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to, it&rsquo;s going to have an interesting fight and it&rsquo;s going to have</p>
<p>an interesting evolution and well, what do you hope to do with it in nonphysical terms?</p>
<p>Gosh, I hope it revolutionizes our relationship of well with people outside of the institutional</p>
<p>framework and it re inflicts us into the institutional framework where we can do the most good to</p>
<p>bring the institutions back to health.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like these are positive, uplifting questions and if you had Frank will check,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t say, Frank, let&rsquo;s be honest, you have done very little with your life after</p>
<p>the original, a huge show that you used to break onto the physics scene.</p>
<p>Like we weirdly ask people different questions based upon how they sit down.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very strange, right?</p>
<p>But you have to understand that.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>I get these days, a large number of emails from people with the equivalent of a theory</p>
<p>of everything for AGI and I use my own radar, BS radar to detect unfairly, perhaps whether</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re full of shit or not, because I love where you&rsquo;re going with this, by the way.</p>
<p>My concern I often think about is there&rsquo;s elements of brilliance in what people write</p>
<p>to me and I&rsquo;m trying to right now, as you made it clear, the kind of judgments and assumptions</p>
<p>we make, how am I supposed to deal with you who are not an outsider of the system and</p>
<p>think about what you&rsquo;re doing because my radar is saying you&rsquo;re not full of shit.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m also not completely outside of the system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve danced beautifully.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve actually got all the credibility that you&rsquo;re supposed to get, all the nice little</p>
<p>stamps of approval, not all, but a large enough amount.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s hard to put into words exactly why you sound, whether your theory turns out</p>
<p>to be good or not, you sound like a special human being.</p>
<p>I appreciate that and thank you in a good way.</p>
<p>So but what am I supposed to do with that flood of emails from AGI?</p>
<p>Why do I sound different?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And I would like to systemize that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Look, you know, when you&rsquo;re talking to people, you very quickly can surmise, like, am I claiming</p>
<p>to be a physicist?</p>
<p>No, I say it every turn.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a physicist, right?</p>
<p>When I say to you, when you say something about bundles, you say, well, can you explain</p>
<p>it differently?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m pushing around on this area, that lever over there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to find something that we can play with and engage.</p>
<p>And you know, another thing is that I&rsquo;ll say something at scale.</p>
<p>So if I was saying completely wrong things about bundles on the Joe Rogan program, you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think that we wouldn&rsquo;t hear a crushing chorus.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And you know, same thing with geometric unity.</p>
<p>So I put up this video from this Oxford lecture.</p>
<p>I understand that it&rsquo;s not a standard lecture, but you haven&rsquo;t heard, you know, the most</p>
<p>brilliant people in the field say, well, this is obviously nonsense.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know what to make of it.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going to hide behind, well, he hasn&rsquo;t said enough details.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the paper?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the criticism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten the same kind of criticism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve published a few things and like, especially stuff related to Tesla that we did studies</p>
<p>on Tesla vehicles and the kind of criticism I&rsquo;ve gotten, which showed that they&rsquo;re completely.</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>Like the guy who had Elon Musk on his program twice is going to give us an accurate assessment.</p>
<p>Next.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just very low level.</p>
<p>Like without actually ever addressing the content.</p>
<p>You know, Lex, I think that in part you&rsquo;re trying to solve a puzzle that isn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>your puzzle.</p>
<p>I think, you know, that I&rsquo;m sincere.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know whether the theory is going to work or not.</p>
<p>And you know that it&rsquo;s not coming out of somebody who&rsquo;s coming out of left field, like the story</p>
<p>makes sense.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s enough that&rsquo;s new and creative and different in other aspects where you can check</p>
<p>me that your real concern is, are you really telling me that when you start breaking the</p>
<p>rules, you see the system for what it is and it&rsquo;s become really vicious and aggressive.</p>
<p>And the answer is yes, and I had to break the rules in part because of learning issues</p>
<p>because I came into this field, you know, with a totally different set of attributes.</p>
<p>My profile just doesn&rsquo;t look like anybody else&rsquo;s remotely, but as a result, what that</p>
<p>did is it showed me what is the system true to its own ideals or does it just follow these</p>
<p>weird procedures and then when it, when you take it off the rails, it behaves terribly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really what my story I think does is it just says, well, he completely takes</p>
<p>the system into new territory where it&rsquo;s not expecting to have to deal with somebody with</p>
<p>these confusing sets of attributes.</p>
<p>And I think what he&rsquo;s telling us is he believes it behaves terribly.</p>
<p>Now, if you take somebody with perfect standardized tests and you know, a winner of math competitions</p>
<p>and you put them in a PhD program, they&rsquo;re probably going to be okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that the system, um, you know, breaks down for any everybody under all circumstances.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying when you present the system with a novel situation at the moment, it will almost</p>
<p>certainly break down with probability approaching 100%.</p>
<p>But to me, the painful and the tragic thing is it, uh, sorry to bring out my motherly</p>
<p>instinct, but it feels like it&rsquo;s too much.</p>
<p>It could be too much of a burden to exist outside the system, maybe, but psychologically,</p>
<p>first of all, I&rsquo;ve got a podcast that I kind of like and I&rsquo;ve got amazing friends.</p>
<p>I have a life which has more interesting people passing through it than I know what to do</p>
<p>with.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And they haven&rsquo;t managed to kill me off yet.</p>
<p>So, so far, so good.</p>
<p>Speaking of which you host an amazing podcast that we&rsquo;ve mentioned several times, but should</p>
<p>mention over and over the portal, uh, where you somehow manage every single conversation</p>
<p>is a surprise.</p>
<p>You go, I mean, not just the guests, but just the places you take them, uh, the, the kind</p>
<p>of ways they become challenging and how you recover from that.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, uh, there&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s full of genuine human moments.</p>
<p>So I really appreciate what you&rsquo;re, it&rsquo;s a fun, fun podcast to listen to.</p>
<p>Uh, let me ask some silly questions about it.</p>
<p>What have you learned about conversation about human to human conversation?</p>
<p>Well, I have a problem that I haven&rsquo;t solved on the portal, which is that in general, when</p>
<p>I ask people questions, they usually find their deeply grooved answers and I&rsquo;m not so</p>
<p>interested in all of the deeply grooved answers.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a complaint, which I&rsquo;m very sympathetic to actually that I talk over people</p>
<p>that I won&rsquo;t sit still for the answer.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s weirdly sort of correct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m not interested in hearing other voices.</p>
<p>That I&rsquo;m not interested in hearing the same voice on my program that I could have gotten</p>
<p>on somebody else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And I haven&rsquo;t solved that well.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve learned that I need a new conversational technique where I can keep somebody from finding</p>
<p>their comfortable place and yet not be the voice talking over that person.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>I can sense like your conversation with Brett, I can sense you detect that the line he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going down, you know how it&rsquo;s going to end and you think it&rsquo;s a useless line, so you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>just stop it right there and you take them into the direction that you think it should</p>
<p>go.</p>
<p>But that requires interruption.</p>
<p>Well, and it does so far.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t found a better way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for a better way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I don&rsquo;t hear the problem.</p>
<p>I do hear the problem.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t solved the problem.</p>
<p>And you know, on the, on the bread episode, um, I was insufferable.</p>
<p>It was very difficult to listen to.</p>
<p>It was so overbearing.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, I was right.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like funny.</p>
<p>You keep saying that, but I didn&rsquo;t find it maybe because I heard brothers, like I heard</p>
<p>a big brother.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was pretty bad.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think it was bad.</p>
<p>Well, a lot of people found it interesting.</p>
<p>And I think it also has to do with the fact that this has become a frequent experience.</p>
<p>I have several shows where somebody who I very much admire and think of as courageous,</p>
<p>um, you know, I&rsquo;m talking with them, maybe we&rsquo;re friends and they sit down on the show</p>
<p>and they immediately become this fake person.</p>
<p>Like two seconds in there, they&rsquo;re sort of saying, well, I don&rsquo;t want to be too critical</p>
<p>or too harsh.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to name any names.</p>
<p>I wanted this story.</p>
<p>He was like, okay, I&rsquo;m going to put my listeners through three hours of you being sweetness</p>
<p>and light.</p>
<p>Like at least give me some reality and then we can decide to shelve the show and never</p>
<p>let it hear, uh, you know, the, the, the call of freedom in the, in the bigger world.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve seen you break out of that a few times.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen you to be successful that, uh, I forgot to guess, but she was dressed with,</p>
<p>um, um, you were at the end of the episode, you had an argument about Brett.</p>
<p>I forgot.</p>
<p>Agnes Callard.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She was one of the philosophers for at the university of Chicago.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve continuously broken out of her.</p>
<p>Uh, you guys went, you know, uh, I didn&rsquo;t even seem pretty genuine.</p>
<p>I like her.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m completely ethically opposed to what she&rsquo;s ethically for.</p>
<p>Well, she was great.</p>
<p>And she wasn&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re both going hard.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a grownup.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And she knows that I care about her.</p>
<p>So that was awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying that some people are difficult to break out.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s just that, you know, she was bringing the courage of her convictions.</p>
<p>She was sort of defending the system and I thought, wow, that&rsquo;s a pretty indefensible</p>
<p>system that you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great though.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s doing that.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I mean, it made for an awesome, it&rsquo;s very informative for the world.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You just hated.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t stand the idea that somebody says, well, we don&rsquo;t care who gets paid or</p>
<p>who gets the credit as long as we get the goodies.</p>
<p>Cause that seems like insane.</p>
<p>Have you ever been afraid leading into a conversation?</p>
<p>Gary Kasparov.</p>
<p>By the way, I mean, I know I&rsquo;m just a fan taking requests, but I started, I started</p>
<p>the beginning in Russian and in fact I used one word incorrectly.</p>
<p>Is that terrible?</p>
<p>You know, it was, it was pretty good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty good Russian.</p>
<p>What was terrible is I think he complimented you.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Did he compliment you or was that me?</p>
<p>Did he compliment you on your Russian?</p>
<p>Well, he said almost perfect Russian.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like he was full of shit.</p>
<p>That was not great Russian, but that was not great Russian.</p>
<p>That was great.</p>
<p>That was hard.</p>
<p>That was, you tried hard, which is what matters.</p>
<p>That is so insulting.</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>But I do hope you continue.</p>
<p>It felt like, I don&rsquo;t know how long it went.</p>
<p>It might&rsquo;ve been like a two hour conversation, but it felt, I hope it continues.</p>
<p>Like I feel like you have many conversations with Gary.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I would love to hear.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain conversations I would just love to hear a long, much longer.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s coming from a very, it&rsquo;s this issue about needing to overpower people in a very dangerous</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>And so Gary has that need.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t, he was interrupting you.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>It was an interesting dynamic.</p>
<p>It was a, it was an interesting dynamic.</p>
<p>Two Weinsteins going at you.</p>
<p>I mean, two powerhouse egos, brilliant.</p>
<p>No, don&rsquo;t say egos, minds, spirits.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have an ego.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the most humble person I know.</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s a complete lie.</p>
<p>Do you think about your own mortality, death?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Are you afraid?</p>
<p>Well, I released a theory during something that can kill older people.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Oh, is there a little bit of a parallel there?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want it to die with me.</p>
<p>What do you hope your legacy is?</p>
<p>Oh, I hope my legacy is accurate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to write on my accomplishments rather than how my community decided to ding me while</p>
<p>I was alive.</p>
<p>That would be great.</p>
<p>What about if it was significantly exaggerated?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>You want it to be accurate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got some pretty terrific stuff and whether it works out or doesn&rsquo;t that I would like</p>
<p>it to reflect what I actually was.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll settle for accurate.</p>
<p>What would you say, what is the greatest element of a Eric Weinstein accomplishment in life</p>
<p>in terms of being accurate?</p>
<p>What are you most proud of?</p>
<p>The idea that we were stalled out in the hardest field at the most difficult juncture and that</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t listen to that voice ever that said, stop, you&rsquo;re hurting yourself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re hurting your family.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re hurting everybody.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re embarrassing yourself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re screwing up.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a failure.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a fraud.</p>
<p>Turn back, save yourself.</p>
<p>That voice, I didn&rsquo;t ultimately listen to it and it was going for 35, 37 years.</p>
<p>Very hard.</p>
<p>And I hope you never listen to that voice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re an inspiration.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I appreciate that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just infinitely honored that you would spend time with me.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been a mentor to me, almost a friend.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine a better person to talk to in this world.</p>
<p>So thank you so much for talking to me.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait till we do it again.</p>
<p>Lex, thanks for sticking with me and thanks for being the most singular guy in the podcasting</p>
<p>space.</p>
<p>In terms of all of my interviews, I would say that the last one I did with you, many</p>
<p>people feel was my best and it was a nonconventional one.</p>
<p>So whatever it is that you&rsquo;re bringing to the game, I think everyone&rsquo;s noticing and</p>
<p>keep at it.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Eric Weinstein.</p>
