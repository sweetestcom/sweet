about vitamin b5 pantothenic acid your adrenals and the quality of your sleep the first thing you need to know is that vitamin b5 is essential for the production or synthesis of acetylcholine which is good for your focus and memory it&amp;rsquo;s also essential for making the cortisol hormone this is the stress hormone it&amp;rsquo;s also essential for making epinephrine that&amp;rsquo;s adrenaline another adrenal hormone serotonin and melatonin so as you can see it&amp;rsquo;s very important in creating the stress hormones as well as the hormones involving sleep as well as the hormones involving your mood b5 can directly support the cell that controls the circadian rhythms okay that&amp;rsquo;s the central clock in your brain that helps you keep your circadian waves in check and this clock is called a suprachiasmatic nucleus so b5 is necessary to support that clock and by the way you not only have this central clock in your brain you have other clocks in virtually every single cell in your body they&amp;rsquo;re called peripheral clocks and they&amp;rsquo;re all linked up with your major clock in your brain and so this way when you&amp;rsquo;re asleep you have the rest of the body also asleep so you&amp;rsquo;re not having things like restless leg syndrome as you&amp;rsquo;re trying to sleep or other conditions and so if you&amp;rsquo;re low or deficient in vitamin b5 these are the symptoms that you can experience number one irritability number two fatigue athlete numbness in the hands and the feet muscle cramps especially at night restlessness okay that&amp;rsquo;s going to affect your sleep as well as sleep disturbances in general and so when you take vitamin b5 it actually helps to regulate cortisol let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at how cortisol is produced you have the hypothalamus okay in your brain that&amp;rsquo;s like the master gland and then you have the middle man which is the pituitary okay a lot of times people call the pituitary the master gland but really it&amp;rsquo;s the middle man the via between the master gland and the actual gland that it&amp;rsquo;s going to and so we have the hypothalamus pituitary and the adrenals okay so we have various hormone communications throughout this pathway and so the whole goal is that the environment like stress for example activate certain hormones in your brain through your receptors that signal down to the pituitary and the adrenal to release its hormones to adapt the body to stress now if you&amp;rsquo;re trying to sleep at night and you&amp;rsquo;re trying to adapt the body to stress you&amp;rsquo;re not going to sleep and so when cortisol is produced it sends also a signal back up to the pituitary and the hypothalamus letting those two glands know that that function was carried out and so this negative feedback turns off the pituitary and the hypothalamus so that hormone doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to keep being generated okay now the important thing to note is that vitamin b5 makes the hormone from the pituitary called acth more sensitive now what does that mean more sensitive what that means it just makes that hormone work better and more complete so when the cortisol is produced and it&amp;rsquo;s and it comes back around to turn off this pituitary it&amp;rsquo;s able to turn it off and so vitamin b5 helps this communication pathway to help regulate cortisols and also b5 is needed to make cortisol which then allows cortisol to come around and turn off the switch as well so when you think about b5 think about a vitamin that helps to regulate the amount of cortisol you need so it&amp;rsquo;s not too high and not too low when you&amp;rsquo;re trying to sleep on top of high cortisol you&amp;rsquo;re not going to be able to sleep okay especially the second half of the sleep where you have the rem which is the superficial type sleep you&amp;rsquo;re just not going to get a quality of sleep you&amp;rsquo;re going to get up usually around 2 2:30 3 o&amp;rsquo;clock and so you can take pantothenic acid as a supplement but there&amp;rsquo;s another version of pantothenic acid that might be more powerful and this is called pantothene which is kind of like the active form of b5 so panthenic acid has to convert into this active form called pantothene and so some people have a problem with vitamin b5 because they can&amp;rsquo;t make this conversion and for those people they definitely need the pantothene version of this vitamin and so if you have adrenal problems or sleep problems you may want to add between 500 and a thousand milligrams of vitamin b5 to help you with lowering your corsol so you can get a better sleep now if you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen my recent video on sleep i want you to check that out too because there are several other factors that you want to combine in improving the quality of your sleep hey before you go if you&amp;rsquo;re benefiting from any of my content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below"><title>Vitamin B5, Adrenals & Your Sleep ｜ DrEricBergDC | SWIEST</title>

your adrenals and the quality of your sleep  </p><p>the first thing you need to know is that vitamin 
b5 is essential for the production or synthesis  </p><p>of acetylcholine which is good for your focus and 
memory it&rsquo;s also essential for making the cortisol  </p><p>hormone this is the stress hormone it&rsquo;s 
also essential for making epinephrine that&rsquo;s  </p><p>adrenaline another adrenal hormone serotonin and 
melatonin so as you can see it&rsquo;s very important  </p><p>in creating the stress hormones as well as the 
hormones involving sleep as well as the hormones  </p><p>involving your mood b5 can directly support 
the cell that controls the circadian rhythms  </p><p>okay that&rsquo;s the central clock in your brain 
that helps you keep your circadian waves  </p><p>in check and this clock is called a 
suprachiasmatic nucleus so b5 is necessary  </p><p>to support that clock and by the way you not 
only have this central clock in your brain  </p><p>you have other clocks in virtually every single 
cell in your body they&rsquo;re called peripheral clocks  </p><p>and they&rsquo;re all linked up with your major clock in 
your brain and so this way when you&rsquo;re asleep you  </p><p>have the rest of the body also asleep so you&rsquo;re 
not having things like restless leg syndrome as  </p><p>you&rsquo;re trying to sleep or other conditions and 
so if you&rsquo;re low or deficient in vitamin b5  </p><p>these are the symptoms that you can experience 
number one irritability number two fatigue athlete  </p><p>numbness in the hands and the feet muscle 
cramps especially at night restlessness  </p><p>okay that&rsquo;s going to affect your sleep as well 
as sleep disturbances in general and so when you  </p><p>take vitamin b5 it actually helps to regulate 
cortisol let&rsquo;s take a look at how cortisol is  </p><p>produced you have the hypothalamus okay in your 
brain that&rsquo;s like the master gland and then you  </p><p>have the middle man which is the pituitary okay a 
lot of times people call the pituitary the master  </p><p>gland but really it&rsquo;s the middle man the via 
between the master gland and the actual gland  </p><p>that it&rsquo;s going to and so we have the hypothalamus 
pituitary and the adrenals okay so we have various  </p><p>hormone communications throughout this pathway 
and so the whole goal is that the environment  </p><p>like stress for example activate certain 
hormones in your brain through your receptors  </p><p>that signal down to the pituitary and the adrenal 
to release its hormones to adapt the body to  </p><p>stress now if you&rsquo;re trying to sleep at night 
and you&rsquo;re trying to adapt the body to stress  </p><p>you&rsquo;re not going to sleep and so when cortisol 
is produced it sends also a signal back up to  </p><p>the pituitary and the hypothalamus letting those 
two glands know that that function was carried out  </p><p>and so this negative feedback turns off the 
pituitary and the hypothalamus so that hormone  </p><p>doesn&rsquo;t have to keep being generated okay now the 
important thing to note is that vitamin b5 makes  </p><p>the hormone from the pituitary called acth more 
sensitive now what does that mean more sensitive  </p><p>what that means it just makes that hormone work 
better and more complete so when the cortisol is  </p><p>produced and it&rsquo;s and it comes back around to turn 
off this pituitary it&rsquo;s able to turn it off and so  </p><p>vitamin b5 helps this communication pathway to 
help regulate cortisols and also b5 is needed to  </p><p>make cortisol which then allows cortisol to 
come around and turn off the switch as well  </p><p>so when you think about b5 think about a vitamin 
that helps to regulate the amount of cortisol  </p><p>you need so it&rsquo;s not too high and not too low when 
you&rsquo;re trying to sleep on top of high cortisol  </p><p>you&rsquo;re not going to be able to sleep okay 
especially the second half of the sleep where  </p><p>you have the rem which is the superficial type 
sleep you&rsquo;re just not going to get a quality of  </p><p>sleep you&rsquo;re going to get up usually around 2 2:30 3 o&rsquo;clock and so you can take pantothenic acid  </p><p>as a supplement but there&rsquo;s another version of 
pantothenic acid that might be more powerful and  </p><p>this is called pantothene which is kind of like 
the active form of b5 so panthenic acid has to  </p><p>convert into this active form called pantothene 
and so some people have a problem with vitamin  </p><p>b5 because they can&rsquo;t make this conversion and for 
those people they definitely need the pantothene  </p><p>version of this vitamin and so if you have 
adrenal problems or sleep problems you may want to  </p><p>add between 500 and a thousand milligrams 
of vitamin b5 to help you with lowering your  </p><p>corsol so you can get a better sleep now if 
you haven&rsquo;t seen my recent video on sleep i  </p><p>want you to check that out too because there are 
several other factors that you want to combine  </p><p>in improving the quality of your sleep hey before 
you go if you&rsquo;re benefiting from any of my content  </p><p>i would love to hear about your success
