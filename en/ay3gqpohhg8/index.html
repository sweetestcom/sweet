<p>this book it was called eat rich live</p>
<p>long mastering the low carb keto</p>
<p>spectrum and I said I&rsquo;ve never seen that</p>
<p>before I just noticed a hot over 100</p>
<p>reviews 97% 5/5 star so I&rsquo;m like what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen that high percentage</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s amazing so I had to</p>
<p>get it had to read it I was thoroughly</p>
<p>impressed and so and then I started</p>
<p>watching your videos so I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>honored to have you to interview you</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m I I really were on the same</p>
<p>wavelength</p>
<p>so mr. Cummings is a engineer and what I</p>
<p>like about that is that you think in</p>
<p>logics</p>
<p>you look at cause and effect honestly I</p>
<p>believe that medicine really does not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not very scientific</p>
<p>conventional medicine it&rsquo;s not very</p>
<p>logical it&rsquo;s mainstream is just like</p>
<p>completely illogical so unfortunately</p>
<p>you know other people from the outside</p>
<p>have to come in to try to figure this</p>
<p>out and dissect it and you looked at</p>
<p>this from an engineer standpoint cause</p>
<p>and effect to make it really simple for</p>
<p>people to understand so I really</p>
<p>appreciate that</p>
<p>hey thanks a lot Eric and I&rsquo;m delighted</p>
<p>to be a to be in an interview here so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an honor for me also for sure</p>
<p>awesome well we&rsquo;re just gonna dive right</p>
<p>and I have some questions the first</p>
<p>question I have is them from your</p>
<p>experience from your research what is</p>
<p>the single common denominator with most</p>
<p>health problems chronic health problems</p>
<p>nowadays the use you&rsquo;re seeing like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the com</p>
<p>if you had to like pick one thing</p>
<p>yeah well Eric it&rsquo;s hard to big warm</p>
<p>thing because I find that multifactorial</p>
<p>is often used as an excuse like in heart</p>
<p>disease it&rsquo;s multi factors as 300</p>
<p>factors and that kind of gets people off</p>
<p>the hook would be but not clarifying</p>
<p>what you need to do but in fairness this</p>
<p>health problem is multi-factor too but</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to pick a few of the top</p>
<p>items or Pareto items we like to call</p>
<p>them so the Pareto principle is the top</p>
<p>20% of causes that lead to 80% of your</p>
<p>problem so I think the triumvirate for</p>
<p>myself and dr. Jeff Gerber my co-author</p>
<p>is processed food and bringing as it</p>
<p>brings in refined carbohydrates sugars</p>
<p>and vegetable oils so industrial seed</p>
<p>oils so if you&rsquo;re allowed to dodge the</p>
<p>question you&rsquo;d say those three together</p>
<p>are the Nexxus that&rsquo;s driving a lot of</p>
<p>modern chronic disease if you had to</p>
<p>pick I&rsquo;d say sugars refined carbs as</p>
<p>being a head of the vegetable oils but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very hard call because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great science on both as to how they can</p>
<p>drive dysfunction obesity and liver</p>
<p>problems and insulin resistance over</p>
<p>time but I think the key message is for</p>
<p>people if you eliminate sugars refined</p>
<p>carbs and the industrial seed oils the</p>
<p>vegetable oils if you just did that</p>
<p>alone you&rsquo;d be way ahead of the puffy oh</p>
<p>yeah so then what so for those viewers</p>
<p>that are under trying to trying to grasp</p>
<p>their wits around this what do those</p>
<p>consuming vegetables and triggers do to</p>
<p>the body like what what do they</p>
<p>influence what&rsquo;s the thing that it does</p>
<p>to the body right well the vegetable</p>
<p>oils there&rsquo;s many many hypotheses and to</p>
<p>a greater or lesser extent some of them</p>
<p>are proven out so one thing about the</p>
<p>vegetable oils is their promise to</p>
<p>oxidation in the body so their own</p>
<p>stable polyunsaturated aaalac put it</p>
<p>very well we need some of these</p>
<p>polyunsaturated vegetable oils and the</p>
<p>percentage you need in your diet is very</p>
<p>low because they act as signaling</p>
<p>molecules and cell men</p>
<p>brain fluidity molecules so they&rsquo;re kind</p>
<p>of technical components that you need</p>
<p>but you should not be using them as fuel</p>
<p>because when you take in excessive</p>
<p>amounts you have excessive</p>
<p>polyunsaturated in the body a proneness</p>
<p>oxidation and damage and oxidative</p>
<p>stress and then inflammatory cascades</p>
<p>which dr. K&rsquo;s in deep nutrition Ventris</p>
<p>in great detail and all of the evidence</p>
<p>behind us so there&rsquo;s the whole</p>
<p>instability of these molecules when</p>
<p>taken to excess certainly when you cook</p>
<p>them and eat them even more so and then</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also emerging theories that they</p>
<p>drive obesity through enhancing</p>
<p>influence sensitivity of your adipocytes</p>
<p>or your fat cells and enabling them to</p>
<p>enlarge and gather more fat than</p>
<p>otherwise would occur so I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some great animal model experiments on</p>
<p>vegetable oils that people may not be</p>
<p>aware of in one area they did rat</p>
<p>experiments where they gave high</p>
<p>percentages of vegetable oils like</p>
<p>soybean oil and linoleic acid is another</p>
<p>big component and they found that when</p>
<p>you fed them quite a lot of vegetable</p>
<p>oil in their diet</p>
<p>if you subjected them to alcohol they</p>
<p>got massive liver damage but in the same</p>
<p>experiments when they had very low poly</p>
<p>on a trip and high saturated animal fat</p>
<p>like beef tallow they gave the same</p>
<p>large amount of alcohol but had almost</p>
<p>no liver damage that&rsquo;s just that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>interesting one so one of those papers</p>
<p>was entitled that vegetable oils are</p>
<p>essentially required for liver damage</p>
<p>from alcohol not just that they make it</p>
<p>worse but you almost need to have them</p>
<p>in the diet and they went through all</p>
<p>the mechanisms and then you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>obesity so there&rsquo;s many recent</p>
<p>experiments quite recent on mouse models</p>
<p>where they fed 8 to 10 percent of these</p>
<p>vegetable oils versus one percent which</p>
<p>is what humans traditionally had and</p>
<p>they saw hugely increased liver fat</p>
<p>obesity and other issues in the mice at</p>
<p>the 8 to 10 percent and they raised the</p>
<p>issue that we&rsquo;ve been told to eat</p>
<p>vegetable oils</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re eating eight to ten percent we</p>
<p>tested this in an animal model and we</p>
<p>see it causes obesity and liver fatty</p>
<p>liver the very things that humans are</p>
<p>experienced in the last 40 years as weed</p>
<p>more vegetable oils Wow so one could go</p>
<p>on but there&rsquo;s so so much evidence and</p>
<p>we have it in the book especially in the</p>
<p>appendix we don&rsquo;t want to go too heavy</p>
<p>and the main body of the books who even</p>
<p>appendix from vegetable oils going</p>
<p>through this and much much more and</p>
<p>human human trials the Sidney Hart trial</p>
<p>had the data was essentially perfectly</p>
<p>put aside thirty years ago and it was</p>
<p>basically rediscovered by a team in the</p>
<p>UK in the British Medical Association</p>
<p>and they published that the people on</p>
<p>the higher vegetable oil had twenty to</p>
<p>thirty percent more cardiovascular death</p>
<p>and all cause mortality and in the yeah</p>
<p>the Veterans Administration trial they</p>
<p>saw a slight improvement in</p>
<p>cardiovascular events from the man with</p>
<p>the high vegetable oil but no</p>
<p>improvement in all cause mortality and</p>
<p>quietly a year later they published a</p>
<p>paper explaining that the reason there</p>
<p>was no improvement in all cause even</p>
<p>though the heart events reduced a little</p>
<p>whilst there was an increase in cancer</p>
<p>and cancer death which was significant</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s all of these human trials to</p>
<p>but as you well know the ones that go</p>
<p>against the dogma that the Polly&rsquo;s are</p>
<p>gods and the satyrs babs they quietly</p>
<p>disappear and that&rsquo;s the way the bias</p>
<p>works Wow amazing and then as far as the</p>
<p>and you you talked extensively</p>
<p>extensively about this the topic between</p>
<p>some people people consuming high</p>
<p>cholesterol foods and heart disease can</p>
<p>you touch on that a little bit because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been ingrained in almost</p>
<p>brainwashed into our minds that oh yeah</p>
<p>cholesterol oh my gosh you&rsquo;re eating all</p>
<p>those eggs it&rsquo;s gonna cause a heart</p>
<p>attack well yeah at the forty lead off</p>
<p>Eric I&rsquo;m sure you see the recent report</p>
<p>coming out showing that eggs actually</p>
<p>cause no harm for heart disease even in</p>
<p>diabetics and the whole the whole</p>
<p>literature is a bit of a mess but very</p>
<p>simply at many</p>
<p>kids go and Sookie&rsquo;s decided he was</p>
<p>researcher that saturated fat drove up</p>
<p>cholesterol in the blood and the</p>
<p>cholesterol in the blood was a causal</p>
<p>driving factor for heart disease now</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all kind of a half truth and not</p>
<p>correct but hey it even Ansell thirty</p>
<p>years ago or forty years ago he realized</p>
<p>quite quickly that dietary cholesterol</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t change your blood cholesterol so</p>
<p>even that guy simply a wiped dietary</p>
<p>cholesterol intake off office table and</p>
<p>yet you&rsquo;re right the myth still is here</p>
<p>i think the u.s. is one of the last</p>
<p>countries in the civilized world to</p>
<p>remove cholesterol as a cause for</p>
<p>concern in the diet just a year or two</p>
<p>ago the rest of the world knew this for</p>
<p>decades so the dietary cholesterol is is</p>
<p>meaningless because if you eat less</p>
<p>cholesterol you&rsquo;re never will make more</p>
<p>cholesterol the crucial components as</p>
<p>you know and if you eat more cholesterol</p>
<p>you will either passage into bile salts</p>
<p>or whatever our annular liver will make</p>
<p>less so it makes no difference so the</p>
<p>remaining question is of course the</p>
<p>dietary fat is that a problem yeah mmm</p>
<p>yeah and that brings up the next</p>
<p>question relating to you have this whole</p>
<p>group of plant-based people and then you</p>
<p>have the meat eaters and there&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>know several so-called credible doctors</p>
<p>who are saying no it&rsquo;s the fat it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>fat that&rsquo;s causing the insulin</p>
<p>resistance it&rsquo;s not the sugar what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your thoughts on that</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s a tricky one because this is</p>
<p>a complex topic and it is relatively</p>
<p>easy for people to twist data so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a hint of truth in that that if you eat</p>
<p>large amounts of fat and they&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>this in human experiments especially in</p>
<p>people who have some insulin resistance</p>
<p>or overweight and they hit them at a</p>
<p>large amount of fat</p>
<p>often with a little bit of sugar</p>
<p>alongside you do see a spike in insulin</p>
<p>resistance but there are mechanisms by</p>
<p>which if you take a large bowl of so</p>
<p>fast</p>
<p>and your body has to become infamous</p>
<p>a cellular level right to keep sugar out</p>
<p>as a fuel source and to use the fat for</p>
<p>fuel so there&rsquo;s an element of truth in</p>
<p>us but the key thing is that chronically</p>
<p>over time it&rsquo;s the refined carbs and</p>
<p>sugars which really cause the insulin</p>
<p>spikes that with time lead to insulin</p>
<p>resistance and through their action in</p>
<p>the liver and one of the best ways to</p>
<p>show the falsehood in what you&rsquo;ve just</p>
<p>mentioned about those doctors is</p>
<p>Professor vol ik and professor Finney</p>
<p>have done many human trials and they do</p>
<p>know that if you eat a lot of fat with a</p>
<p>lot of refined carbohydrate the</p>
<p>carbohydrate must be metabolized first</p>
<p>the fat does not get metabolized</p>
<p>properly and it tends to go into storage</p>
<p>or arrays energy levels or fats in the</p>
<p>blood however when they switch people</p>
<p>who are challenged like diabetic people</p>
<p>are obese people and they switch them to</p>
<p>a very low carb with a very high fat</p>
<p>diet then they get dramatic improvement</p>
<p>in their body markers blood markers over</p>
<p>the following week four months and their</p>
<p>blood fat levels actually drop right</p>
<p>down by eating a very high fat diet but</p>
<p>the key is they&rsquo;re not eating sugars and</p>
<p>refined carbs they&rsquo;re switching to a fat</p>
<p>metabolism absolute absolutely I mean if</p>
<p>you I think people they&rsquo;re not gonna</p>
<p>read the studies themselves but you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re aware of the the rodent that my</p>
<p>studies they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re high fat diet is</p>
<p>not really standardized it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s oh hi</p>
<p>sugar and high fat well in they calling</p>
<p>an eye fat so right there you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>you know alter the data there that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>massive kind of scam I I so strong word</p>
<p>to use but to be quite honest Eric it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an incredible scam I have gone through</p>
<p>endless medicine rat studies and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>absolutely right the high-fat diets</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re called hft they got an Akram hft</p>
<p>we we put in hft and oh look they got</p>
<p>fast oh look they got in so resistant</p>
<p>which are absolutely right there full of</p>
<p>dextrose and vegetable oils or an 8%</p>
<p>soybean oil a mixture of sugar and</p>
<p>vegetable oils along with a load of</p>
<p>large an absolute toxic bomb and but</p>
<p>then they blame it all on the fashion</p>
<p>friendly to all the people well no you</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t eat eggs it&rsquo;s insane it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>insane it&rsquo;s totally insane and and then</p>
<p>the other thing is that you&rsquo;ll see this</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s behind it but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pushing this thing where oh well yeah</p>
<p>kudos good for weight loss but we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know the long-term effects it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>dangerous long-term I&rsquo;m like what what</p>
<p>why do you say that where does that come</p>
<p>from like mm-hmm</p>
<p>they try to you know they&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>different angles of course you know you</p>
<p>have something that&rsquo;s so powerful but we</p>
<p>have thousands of people with amazing</p>
<p>results but then you have you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have the opposing side you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>you know mainstream and you&rsquo;re gonna put</p>
<p>these little doubts in people and so</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a little scared well I want to</p>
<p>do it long-term I&rsquo;m like what are you</p>
<p>gonna go back to the carbs like sugars</p>
<p>it yeah it&rsquo;s crazy and one way they</p>
<p>Trude out on keto as well was the</p>
<p>epileptic kids over the past decades</p>
<p>they were in ketogenic diets and they</p>
<p>showed some evidence of some issues over</p>
<p>time but I went through those studies</p>
<p>and I challenged people to give me clean</p>
<p>studies and they&rsquo;re not out there they</p>
<p>have a fused studies and the kids had</p>
<p>lots of Polly&rsquo;s because of course these</p>
<p>poor guys believe the fat fat is bad so</p>
<p>they put a lot of poly in there as</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fast which we&rsquo;ve already said is</p>
<p>not a good idea they&rsquo;ve also got</p>
<p>medications concurrent they&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>multiple medications so you look at</p>
<p>these kids that maybe don&rsquo;t do so great</p>
<p>over time but it&rsquo;s a really bad</p>
<p>your diet under on multiple meds and</p>
<p>they already have medical issues by</p>
<p>definition because they had epilepsy and</p>
<p>other somewhat comorbidities so using</p>
<p>that as evidence is farcical but they do</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right they do users along the</p>
<p>long term thing you see the onus of</p>
<p>proof is on them at to say there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>long term problem because it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>perfectly natural diet proven</p>
<p>evolutionarily and in many many</p>
<p>populations very healthy populations</p>
<p>with no chronic disease traditionally so</p>
<p>the default is it&rsquo;s fine prove it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re right they bring this thing</p>
<p>up they bring up doubt but they&rsquo;re pass</p>
<p>that they said high carb low fat has</p>
<p>been proven to fail at the population</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;ve done that experiment yeah it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t just to fail I did it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>catastrophic explosive fail and we got</p>
<p>60 52 percent of the adult American</p>
<p>population last year in the paper are</p>
<p>acknowledged to be pre-diabetic or</p>
<p>diabetic now they&rsquo;re all essentially</p>
<p>diabetic Wow you know yeah they all have</p>
<p>hyperinsulinemia they have glucose</p>
<p>metabolism issues hypertension which</p>
<p>goes with us all the classic stuff so</p>
<p>the majority of adult Americans are now</p>
<p>essentially essentially diabetic more if</p>
<p>you measured with insulin and we tell</p>
<p>them to eat more carbohydrates even</p>
<p>though by definition their carbohydrate</p>
<p>intolerance because they&rsquo;re diabetic</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the most obvious thing to me I</p>
<p>just like sometimes I&rsquo;m like is it Maya</p>
<p>a planet an alien plan here can&rsquo;t people</p>
<p>see it I want to bring up this point dr.</p>
<p>Kraft you were able to interview him</p>
<p>before he passed away this guy he wrote</p>
<p>I mean did the research for I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how many years can you can you just tell</p>
<p>us a thumbnail sketch about dr. Kraft</p>
<p>and who he was and what he discovered or</p>
<p>observed right Eric yeah so dr. Kraft we</p>
<p>discovered in 2014 I think from</p>
<p>professor&rsquo;s grand show field in New</p>
<p>Zealand and when I looked him up I</p>
<p>thought wow I gotta talk to this guy</p>
<p>because what he found</p>
<p>with me so powerful from my five years</p>
<p>of research I&rsquo;m basically was a medical</p>
<p>captain in World War two would you</p>
<p>believe actually stationed in Panama he</p>
<p>came back he was a pathologist and he</p>
<p>became a doctor of nuclear medicine</p>
<p>which the running a few in the states in</p>
<p>the 50s and 60s trained to use radio</p>
<p>nucleotides and radioactive substances</p>
<p>in the body so very special guy and</p>
<p>pathologists are amazing generally I</p>
<p>find because they really root cause and</p>
<p>they do the analysis Nate they go deep</p>
<p>so long story short he found he had</p>
<p>access to the new insulin tests he</p>
<p>researched diabetes massively he</p>
<p>discovered that diabetes type 2 is a</p>
<p>disease of high-end forum and that this</p>
<p>was known from the 60s with the work of</p>
<p>yellow and Bernstein and he realized</p>
<p>that the whole diabetes world was</p>
<p>treating it as a disease of high glucose</p>
<p>but that was only a symptom so what he</p>
<p>did was he eventually went on to test</p>
<p>15,000 patients with a five-hour glucose</p>
<p>insulin assay where he fed them glucose</p>
<p>and he measured the glucose and insulin</p>
<p>over five hours around seven</p>
<p>measurements and he realized after a</p>
<p>thousand patients that there were five</p>
<p>special patterns that people had even</p>
<p>though he had thousand people there are</p>
<p>only five patterns of insulin response</p>
<p>you could have and he realized Truths</p>
<p>research only one of those patterns was</p>
<p>healthy non-diabetic and all the other</p>
<p>ones were a form of diabetes</p>
<p>he called it diabetes in situ and</p>
<p>basically he realized that we are not</p>
<p>diagnosing the vast majority of</p>
<p>diabetics because the glucose measures</p>
<p>they used to diagnose for the time the</p>
<p>low glucose has gone up your way down</p>
<p>your diabetes journey it&rsquo;s the rising</p>
<p>insulin after eating carbohydrate that</p>
<p>shows you when you&rsquo;re first diabetic and</p>
<p>he realized essentially that 90% of the</p>
<p>people who had passed a fasting glucose</p>
<p>test could fail his insulin test Wow and</p>
<p>yeah and even 50% of his people who</p>
<p>would pass a glucose tolerance test</p>
<p>could fail his insulin test so he</p>
<p>realized was an enormous amount of</p>
<p>diabetes out there and his test was the</p>
<p>one to use yeah he&rsquo;s a great we</p>
<p>interviewed a man couple years ago he</p>
<p>died at 95 last year but an amazing man</p>
<p>Christian nine children devout hugely</p>
<p>wanting to get the message out but he</p>
<p>was he was robust no one wanted to hear</p>
<p>the American Diabetes Association no one</p>
<p>wants to hear I mean just the fact that</p>
<p>you know doctors rarely ever check</p>
<p>insulin if ever and to know that you can</p>
<p>have diabetes with normal blood sugars</p>
<p>which is so bizarre it&rsquo;s high insulin</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the chain at the first chain of</p>
<p>event that occurs BAM hi yeah that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>and and after time some people down</p>
<p>across their insulin will flag as their</p>
<p>pancreas becomes problematic so they</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t show up at high insulin because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re further down their journey but</p>
<p>the beauty is by looking at insulin</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll always catch people at the</p>
<p>earliest stage you are heading into</p>
<p>trouble because yeah and he his other</p>
<p>statement which was a little strong was</p>
<p>those with cardiovascular disease not</p>
<p>identified with diabetes are simply</p>
<p>undiagnosed though is essentially saying</p>
<p>that most cardiovascular disease is</p>
<p>diabetic type dysfunction it&rsquo;s just for</p>
<p>not diagnosing it and now I think myself</p>
<p>and dr. Garber there are many many other</p>
<p>drivers but I think it&rsquo;s in fairness to</p>
<p>dr. Kraft the line share of of</p>
<p>cardiovascular disease problems</p>
<p>particularly severe ones are tied to</p>
<p>this physiology and the euro aspire</p>
<p>study last year in Europe or two years</p>
<p>ago they essentially found out that just</p>
<p>measuring glucose seventy-five percent</p>
<p>of heart disease victims from ages 18 to</p>
<p>80 across 25 countries 75% have diabetic</p>
<p>abnormality which is incredible</p>
<p>three-quarters and they didn&rsquo;t measure</p>
<p>insulin so a huge amount of</p>
<p>cardiovascular disease is diabetes</p>
<p>not all of</p>
<p>that in the US or a world water that was</p>
<p>across 25 European countries and ages</p>
<p>yeah and they picked cardiovascular</p>
<p>disease patients from ages 18 to 80 so</p>
<p>in engineering world we call that a</p>
<p>really good pole you&rsquo;re pulling all the</p>
<p>ages randomly all the countries and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting a big picture of you and</p>
<p>they wanted to see how much glucose</p>
<p>metabolism issues like diabetes is in</p>
<p>heart disease victims and they found out</p>
<p>they got a shock</p>
<p>I think together shark I didn&rsquo;t right</p>
<p>yeah so what&rsquo;s your what&rsquo;s your kind of</p>
<p>guess at how many people have higher</p>
<p>levels of insulin one of those patterns</p>
<p>in the US what do you think it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>he he found this in the seventies in me</p>
<p>he did and it&rsquo;s very important he was</p>
<p>taking in many patients who had</p>
<p>suspected diabetes but we&rsquo;re not failing</p>
<p>the tests in fairness he was taking</p>
<p>walk-in patients so he didn&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>random sample so his group proved his</p>
<p>methods they were a great group to prove</p>
<p>his methodology in his test but they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t represent the states so myself</p>
<p>and dr. Gerber if 52% are published as</p>
<p>being pre-diabetic or diabetic and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s two years ago and they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really look too closely an insulin or</p>
<p>anything we reckon and many other</p>
<p>doctors in this low carb field in our</p>
<p>network estimate 60 to 65 percent of</p>
<p>adult Americans have not got normal at</p>
<p>you insulin emia or good healthy insulin</p>
<p>response so you may be up to two-thirds</p>
<p>would not pass our criteria and I guess</p>
<p>we see that when we walk out in the</p>
<p>street race you know it you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a shock and the other countries are</p>
<p>all catching up you know Mexico massive</p>
<p>issue Brazil enormous issue particularly</p>
<p>in the population centers China has gone</p>
<p>from 1% in the decade I think to 12%</p>
<p>full-blown and their papers talking</p>
<p>about a catastrophe coming</p>
<p>so this this is blossoming all over the</p>
<p>world Wow</p>
<p>when I tell clients they want to know</p>
<p>they want to get the insulin test even</p>
<p>the doctor doesn&rsquo;t want to do it or they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even never even heard of it I mean</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why this test isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it more available yeah I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s well craft found he was</p>
<p>swimming upstream and all the guys on</p>
<p>his side the the ear nose and throat</p>
<p>doctors actually got involved because</p>
<p>some of those guys discovered that 98%</p>
<p>of their Meniere&rsquo;s disease and kinases</p>
<p>are tinnitus patients ninety-eight</p>
<p>percent plus were failing the craft test</p>
<p>so they discovered all there&rsquo;s many</p>
<p>errors in balance and tinnitus is</p>
<p>massively to do with glucose metabolism</p>
<p>issues but all of those guys were</p>
<p>pushing and having conferences but the</p>
<p>established Orthodox world doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really want to look at insulin insulin</p>
<p>is problematic if you start looking at</p>
<p>insulin you find your way towards low</p>
<p>carb you find your way towards keto if</p>
<p>you look at insulin too much you begin</p>
<p>to say well hold on a minute what are</p>
<p>their cholesterol their cholesterol is</p>
<p>far they&rsquo;re all comfortable focusing</p>
<p>even though insulin is vastly more</p>
<p>important so I&rsquo;d only get the conspiracy</p>
<p>I just think all of the industrial</p>
<p>pharmaceutical food industry and even</p>
<p>research and medical research are all</p>
<p>kind of gently always pushing towards</p>
<p>the bad cholesterol and the high carb</p>
<p>guidelines and this stuff all is</p>
<p>uncomfortable to them and I think we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>seeing it unfolding now it is they have</p>
<p>a great inability to be wrong and I have</p>
<p>to be right they really have to be right</p>
<p>about this like just because it would</p>
<p>just be devastating if they were wrong</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s have to maintain this logical</p>
<p>rightness even though it&rsquo;s completely</p>
<p>insane yeah and they&rsquo;ll die right</p>
<p>exactly I reckon I reckon they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll change slowly they can&rsquo;t change</p>
<p>quickly for the exact reason you said</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll see the guidelines changing</p>
<p>will see more insulin focus but it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have to be slow to protect essentially</p>
<p>all the reputations so</p>
<p>everyone fill out 30 years in the</p>
<p>orthodoxy has been you know going from</p>
<p>warm him she&rsquo;s and it&rsquo;s suddenly over a</p>
<p>year or two we say hold on a minute</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re completely wrong to look at</p>
<p>cholesterol we talk about the moments</p>
<p>the the blood cholesterol and we should</p>
<p>have been looking at insulin</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re completely wrong about high carb</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crazy we should have been looking</p>
<p>at just vegetable carbon fibers real</p>
<p>food carb and higher healthy fats it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all that changed within a year or two I</p>
<p>mean everyone has egg in their face</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s so bad like I would like to</p>
<p>be them either would I in fact you know</p>
<p>I do a lot of educational videos and one</p>
<p>of the where I get a lot of my material</p>
<p>is I basically get it from mainstream</p>
<p>medical sites health care sites because</p>
<p>they basically you just look at their</p>
<p>data and you could you know for a fact</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s 180 degrees backwards I mean</p>
<p>like you just do the opposite you&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>very successful it they always have it</p>
<p>wrong it&rsquo;s just very ironic so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>incredible and it came up the other day</p>
<p>actually that I mentioned to someone</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said this before the only thing</p>
<p>they were really correct on on the big</p>
<p>series of things like cholesterol fat</p>
<p>carb you know salt all of these big</p>
<p>things they talked about the only thing</p>
<p>they were really right about was smoking</p>
<p>right hiccups alright but even then it</p>
<p>took them 30 or 40 years after the data</p>
<p>was in to get it right so they were</p>
<p>slowed down yeah all of the other ones I</p>
<p>mean it couldn&rsquo;t happen by chance that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be wrong on six seven things in a</p>
<p>role like it&rsquo;s six coin tosses heads and</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s where it just sue should</p>
<p>everyone to go with the initial</p>
<p>hypothesis and just be an echo chamber</p>
<p>and stick with us and then together all</p>
<p>wrong well even you being an engineer I</p>
<p>wanted to be an engineer but I was</p>
<p>terrible at math and you have to know</p>
<p>math so you&rsquo;d be engineer you you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t survive if you didn&rsquo;t get it</p>
<p>right I mean you you couldn&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t function you have to be able to</p>
<p>find the truth the causing the foot I</p>
<p>mean like so if they got away with it</p>
<p>for this long it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s insane yeah</p>
<p>well end</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re absolutely hit the nail on the</p>
<p>head you to succeed in the engineering</p>
<p>business you must get root cause and you</p>
<p>cannot just do band-aids or mitigating</p>
<p>fixes like you know the drugs that hope</p>
<p>your blood pressure that will never</p>
<p>succumb header will kill you</p>
<p>so everyone is forced to to be violently</p>
<p>going after the route calls find out the</p>
<p>mechanisms find out what&rsquo;s causing it</p>
<p>and eliminate the calls there&rsquo;s no point</p>
<p>putting a bandaid on us or sticking a</p>
<p>drug on it it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not good enough to</p>
<p>survive but in the medical business</p>
<p>ironically it&rsquo;s kind of the opposite</p>
<p>because the business booms if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>prevent and if you have to do procedures</p>
<p>and you have to do stents and you have</p>
<p>to do bypasses and it&rsquo;s kind of driven</p>
<p>the opposite way it&rsquo;s not anyone&rsquo;s fault</p>
<p>in a way it&rsquo;s just the way it is the</p>
<p>business booms if you steer clear of</p>
<p>Route cars and unfixed paths show up</p>
<p>after the event mostly as long as I</p>
<p>medication lasts for 24 hours we&rsquo;re good</p>
<p>we can just take the next pill yeah</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your thought about the calcium</p>
<p>score son with the vascular system and</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s good with where does that come</p>
<p>from you think yeah well that&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>important one and one of my big goals</p>
<p>when dr. Gerber as well and we features</p>
<p>in the book and explained there is the</p>
<p>calcium scan as the ultimate test for if</p>
<p>you have significant arterial disease so</p>
<p>just briefly for people a calcium scans</p>
<p>a high-speed x-ray it sees the calcium</p>
<p>in your coronary arteries and the</p>
<p>calcium is brought in by your body to</p>
<p>repair essentially shore up or repair</p>
<p>inflamed arteries that are in danger of</p>
<p>of tearing and causing a clasp on a</p>
<p>heart attack</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a natural evolutionary process a</p>
<p>response to injury where basically the</p>
<p>exact same mechanisms that create bone</p>
<p>are used in the artery to strengthen</p>
<p>areas that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>the beauty is the CAC scan the CT scan</p>
<p>of the heart is a five minute scan low</p>
<p>radiation nowadays like a mammogram</p>
<p>really hundred dollars and in a moment</p>
<p>you can see the calcium and when you see</p>
<p>the amount of calcium you know the</p>
<p>amount of disease you</p>
<p>going on four years and your risk with a</p>
<p>zero score compared to a very high score</p>
<p>but a few percent of middle aged people</p>
<p>will have you can have a 30 plus times</p>
<p>higher risk of a cardiac event or death</p>
<p>with a high score so a view of a high</p>
<p>blood pressure you might be two or three</p>
<p>times more likely or if you have a</p>
<p>really high cholesterol or some blood</p>
<p>sugar two times three times more likely</p>
<p>in the next ten years if you have a high</p>
<p>calcium score it can be 30 times more</p>
<p>likely so hopefully people realize that</p>
<p>gives you the answer so we feel very</p>
<p>strongly a middle-aged person you know</p>
<p>the calcium scan will immediately tell</p>
<p>you your risk level and if you really</p>
<p>got to work hard but if you do work hard</p>
<p>and you go low-carb you get some</p>
<p>exposure low stress sleep magnesium and</p>
<p>all the things that you&rsquo;d be very well</p>
<p>aware of keto fasting all the good</p>
<p>things done together and they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>hard and you&rsquo;ll feel better and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>lose weight and you&rsquo;ll feel fantastic</p>
<p>all of that together can actually stop</p>
<p>the calcification increasing so even a</p>
<p>high scoring person like my support or</p>
<p>David Bob at an Irish entrepreneur he</p>
<p>had to score 4000 but he is practically</p>
<p>not risen over the last six years with</p>
<p>exactly the things we know about and if</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t do those things he would have</p>
<p>kept rising at 20 or 30 percent a year</p>
<p>until the event happened so the beauty</p>
<p>is even a high score you can take action</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the fantastic thing so</p>
<p>I guess there&rsquo;s a movie the Widowmaker</p>
<p>if people&rsquo;s gonna ask about that motion</p>
<p>yeah yeah well my my supporter David</p>
<p>Bobbitt and the Irish heart disease</p>
<p>awareness charity set up they founded a</p>
<p>big-budget movie the Widowmaker and if</p>
<p>you google my name and Widowmaker you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>pretty quickly hear a version you can</p>
<p>watch straight away and it tells a</p>
<p>fascinating story after calcium scan and</p>
<p>high for 30 years it didn&rsquo;t get adopted</p>
<p>a bit like insulin and it&rsquo;s narrated by</p>
<p>Gillian Anderson and Larry King as in us</p>
<p>and all the professor&rsquo;s of imaging so so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a great watch Wow</p>
<p>that is I recently saw the magic pill</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>I want to put I&rsquo;ll put a link down below</p>
<p>for for that movie and I do want to</p>
<p>mention to everyone</p>
<p>I rarely recommend books you guys need</p>
<p>to get eat rich live long mastering a</p>
<p>low-carb keto spectrum for weight loss</p>
<p>longevity I&rsquo;ll put a link down below</p>
<p>check this out because it&rsquo;s just filled</p>
<p>with incredible data all the secrets are</p>
<p>right there and I was impressed what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your thoughts on in a minute fasting I</p>
<p>interpret a five-second reaction I love</p>
<p>and I guess it gives to do i IC fasting</p>
<p>as essentially a performance drug and I</p>
<p>know that sounds funny but I&rsquo;ve said it</p>
<p>before when people resonated when I go</p>
<p>on stage speaking at a big event or</p>
<p>anything big coming up or I need to be</p>
<p>at my best</p>
<p>I almost never eat for 24 hours before</p>
<p>that event I go into it 24 28 hours and</p>
<p>to be quite honest I&rsquo;d I&rsquo;d actually feel</p>
<p>not so happy if I didn&rsquo;t do that because</p>
<p>the edge it gives the mental acuity is</p>
<p>the feeling of energy and vibrancy it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>huge so that&rsquo;s just warm advantage and</p>
<p>fasting basically for longest periods</p>
<p>brings down your insulin brings down all</p>
<p>your hormone levels allows your body to</p>
<p>normalize especially for people who have</p>
<p>high insulin or diabetic dysfunction</p>
<p>fasting is very reparative or are very</p>
<p>helpful and over longer periods we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>bring in our top adji so it&rsquo;ll kind of</p>
<p>use up old damage less healthy cells and</p>
<p>recycle them break them up reuse them</p>
<p>for new proteins a beautiful process of</p>
<p>self-healing basically and and fasting</p>
<p>it just you can&rsquo;t really do it when you</p>
<p>are on a high-carb food pyramid diet</p>
<p>because when you&rsquo;re a car burner and you</p>
<p>go without food you know you feel bad</p>
<p>but the beauty is when you become fat</p>
<p>adapted and you&rsquo;ve been a low carb or</p>
<p>keto diet for a while and all the</p>
<p>enzymes have been made to smoothly burn</p>
<p>your body fast fluidly then you can fast</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>unity and I I just love happy Hallows</p>
<p>berg I love us I love the feeling in the</p>
<p>afternoon when I haven&rsquo;t eaten since the</p>
<p>night before and I know the meal I get</p>
<p>at 6:00 p.m. it&rsquo;s gonna be really good</p>
<p>ancestral healthy fats you know some</p>
<p>vegetables low carb and it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>delicious</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be even more delicious</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been fasting in in Ireland</p>
<p>we used to say hunger as a good sauce</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re a fat adapter the hunger</p>
<p>is very manageable you feel great but a</p>
<p>little bit of hunger though does make</p>
<p>the meal when you when you have a</p>
<p>special and you relish it</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m kind of rambling but I just love</p>
<p>fasting it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m all over it might as</p>
<p>well myself a cognitive function</p>
<p>elevation of mood I mean it&rsquo;s like and</p>
<p>then you start eating and I was like no</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel as good now I&rsquo;m like you</p>
<p>know I can go longer so yeah I am I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>all over it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in termina fasting and keto and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>did you have anything else that you</p>
<p>wanted to talk about in your recent</p>
<p>studies things that you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>researching or any interesting things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re involved with well yeah I</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m gonna be in Prague actually next</p>
<p>week at a conference food news and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be fun and Czechoslovakia</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a sign that things are moving</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s essentially a low-carb</p>
<p>biased conference they&rsquo;re not calling a</p>
<p>low-carb too much they&rsquo;re trying to keep</p>
<p>it as an healthy food and question</p>
<p>processed food then in the public health</p>
<p>collaboration PHC in the UK in London a</p>
<p>few days later and then there&rsquo;s loads of</p>
<p>events in the US this year going to</p>
<p>quito fest and north carolina</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s July and ancestral health</p>
<p>and low-carb USA and San Diego and</p>
<p>Keyshia Kahne in Texas so I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great that really the whole low-carb</p>
<p>keto thing is blossoming and the forces</p>
<p>that try to push against that the</p>
<p>invention derly ER they&rsquo;re beginning to</p>
<p>have an issue I think so it&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>times</p>
<p>but I will just mention one other paper</p>
<p>I got the other day 2014 and I was</p>
<p>amazed I didn&rsquo;t have it already and</p>
<p>actually I&rsquo;ll send it on to you if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have it and it was the metabolic</p>
<p>syndrome it&rsquo;s much bigger than you think</p>
<p>by a team of doctors and profs and what</p>
<p>they did was they knew that the</p>
<p>metabolic syndrome which is huge in the</p>
<p>world was kind of defined by insulin</p>
<p>even though they don&rsquo;t even measure</p>
<p>insulin and that they measure HDL and</p>
<p>glucose so they said well let&rsquo;s go and</p>
<p>look at all the metabolic syndrome</p>
<p>papers and pull out the ones where they</p>
<p>measured insulin because like you said</p>
<p>Eric they don&rsquo;t measure insulin much so</p>
<p>they had six hundreds they got to answer</p>
<p>sixty or seventy where they have insulin</p>
<p>measurements and they were addressing</p>
<p>all different diseases cardiovascular</p>
<p>disease cancer you know if you think you</p>
<p>can rheumatoid arthritis all these</p>
<p>inflammatory diseases and what they</p>
<p>found out insulin stood up as being</p>
<p>higher for the people with the problems</p>
<p>and I think around fifty eight hundred</p>
<p>sixty-one papers in other words</p>
<p>hyperinsulinemia which is metabolic</p>
<p>syndrome which is type 2 diabetes</p>
<p>syndrome is all kind of the warm thing</p>
<p>you measure what high insulin and high</p>
<p>insulin showed up in nearly every paper</p>
<p>as being highly linked to all these</p>
<p>different diseases and they basically</p>
<p>said this is huge and are correct but</p>
<p>like you say Eric very few doctors</p>
<p>realizes this is the big thing in the</p>
<p>next ten years is to put</p>
<p>hyperinsulinemia at the center of</p>
<p>chronic disease and get everyone looking</p>
<p>others and the likes of the calcium scan</p>
<p>for middle-aged people to find out where</p>
<p>they are and then take action yeah there</p>
<p>are two big things I I&rsquo;m just like when</p>
<p>I go over a metabolic syndrome II</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this oh there&rsquo;s associated high</p>
<p>in sign I&rsquo;m like no it&rsquo;s causing it why</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t you see that it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>ironic and it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s frustrating</p>
<p>especially since people are going</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to them for advice Wow</p>
<p>oh yeah I want to get that paper for</p>
<p>sure</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll pick it onto your straightaway</p>
<p>awesome well I want to really thank you</p>
<p>for your time and your what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>telling the story of you know giving</p>
<p>people the truth about their health I</p>
<p>also want to recommend everyone needs to</p>
<p>get the book I&rsquo;m gonna put a link down</p>
<p>below watch Widowmaker got to check that</p>
<p>out I haven&rsquo;t watched the whole thing I</p>
<p>watched the preview I&rsquo;m gonna is it a</p>
<p>Netflix - or is it Amazon yeah the full</p>
<p>movie is it might be still on Netflix</p>
<p>but I did the short version is is</p>
<p>accessible they give you a link for that</p>
<p>and of course the full version is on a</p>
<p>couple of different formats I think but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of been out a couple years and</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t get really widely circulated</p>
<p>there was a very ironic twist where it</p>
<p>was put in for the Oscars a few years</p>
<p>ago and there was a mistake made it was</p>
<p>put in for Maine fella instead of Maine</p>
<p>documentary and it could have worn</p>
<p>what unfortunately was put in the wrong</p>
<p>category anyway so that&rsquo;s an aside but</p>
<p>yeah and the book we go into CAC</p>
<p>in detail in the book and cholesterol</p>
<p>and answers other questions about why</p>
<p>people believe cholesterol is important</p>
<p>and why it has some importance but but</p>
<p>not what people think and I think we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on iTunes or on Amazon or in Costco</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in Barnes &amp; Noble it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>available all over I think awesome</p>
<p>Wow well thank you so much I appreciate</p>
<p>this thank you so much Eric and and</p>
<p>thanks for you having me on I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>delighted pleasure absolutely great</p>
<p>and then of course you have the I guess</p>
<p>here the only thing I know about Ireland</p>
<p>is the butter Kerrygold yeah we take</p>
<p>that for granted but the other thing in</p>
<p>Ireland is the nature of Ireland with</p>
<p>its enormous amount of grass fields and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s economically viable and default to</p>
<p>just have cattle on the grass so not</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re amazing green people we</p>
<p>just happen to have grass Felda fed as a</p>
<p>default and we have to carry gold</p>
<p>grass-fed butter as a default it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>just default now I&rsquo;m sure in the coming</p>
<p>years corporates and unfarmed</p>
<p>corporations will try and turn it into</p>
<p>something even more profitable but for</p>
<p>the moment you leave amazing food and</p>
<p>interest in Eric you love this it&rsquo;s ten</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s ten dollars let&rsquo;s say for two</p>
<p>pounds of lean premium mince or ground</p>
<p>beef so say say it&rsquo;s ten dollars for two</p>
<p>pounds right beside that there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>high fat generic same cattle same cows</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s high fat it&rsquo;s not healthy not</p>
<p>lean and that&rsquo;s four dollars for two</p>
<p>pounds so it&rsquo;s less than half the cost</p>
<p>for the very product that I will have to</p>
<p>get crazy it&rsquo;s reversed and eggs are</p>
<p>quite cheap because of the feeling that</p>
<p>eggs are not so healthy it keeps the</p>
<p>price down it&rsquo;s basically you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>all this high fat high quality product</p>
<p>for a really good deal essentially yeah</p>
<p>and if the world turns it&rsquo;ll get a</p>
<p>little more expensive but in fairness</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a small price to pay to</p>
<p>the curb the epidemics but but yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>Wow yeah I&rsquo;ll pay more for the more fat</p>
<p>any day absolutely nutrient density and</p>
<p>healthy fats exactly</p>
