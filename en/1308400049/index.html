    <p>Hi friends! So this week I&rsquo;m going to give you all my tips for how to not get attached to people so fast.</p>
<p>Because my Pisces ass, please. I used to get attached to people like that.</p>
<p>Like it was so annoying how quick I would like plan my future with someone.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;d meet them, I would see them across the room and be like, boom, we&rsquo;re dating, we&rsquo;re married.</p>
<p>I found the one! Like I used to get so attached to people so goddamn quick.</p>
<p>And I would hurt my own feelings a lot because I would like get excited by a situation or get excited by a person</p>
<p>and then it wouldn&rsquo;t work, you know.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to give you all my tips on how to not get attached so quick.</p>
<p>Because a lot of you guys deal with that and a lot of you guys have written in and asked me to cover this.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to do it.</p>
<p>But I have a little announcement to make.</p>
<p>I made a Facebook community for all of us.</p>
<p>So I made a page on Facebook.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a Facebook group where all of you guys can join it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be free.</p>
<p>But all of you guys can join it and it&rsquo;s going to be a private group.</p>
<p>So anything you post in there or I post in there, it&rsquo;s like only for the group to see.</p>
<p>But I wanted to make a little community so that you guys could go in and like talk to each other, make some friends, one.</p>
<p>But two, if you ever need advice on something or you just want to like get another opinion on a situation that you&rsquo;re going through</p>
<p>from someone who&rsquo;s not in it and from someone who fucking gets it.</p>
<p>Because if you listen to this podcast and you&rsquo;re like me, your brain just works right, babe.</p>
<p>Love you for it.</p>
<p>But I made the Facebook group so that you guys could go in and talk to each other.</p>
<p>So if you have a situation or you want advice on something, go in and post in the Facebook group.</p>
<p>And like comment back to each other.</p>
<p>Shoot shit back and forth.</p>
<p>Like give your two cents.</p>
<p>Help people out with their situations.</p>
<p>And like when you&rsquo;re going through something, feel free to go in there and vent and like get advice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like we all get it and we can all be there for each other.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go in and I&rsquo;ll be like commenting back and shit too.</p>
<p>And I wanted to give you guys a sense of belonging and feel like you have somewhere you can go and someone you can talk to at all times.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a lot of you guys that watch this and follow me.</p>
<p>So I wanted to give us all a space where we can like belong and like be friends.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll put the link to where you can join the Facebook community in the description of this podcast.</p>
<p>Just click the link.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be on Facebook.</p>
<p>I know we don&rsquo;t like Facebook.</p>
<p>Facebook&rsquo;s kind of weird.</p>
<p>But I feel like this is the best place to do it because it&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to make a fucking discord.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s too goddamn difficult.</p>
<p>Like a little chat room.</p>
<p>No, this is not fucking kick.</p>
<p>So the Facebook group just makes it easy.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m really excited about it.</p>
<p>And I hope you guys are too.</p>
<p>So go join as soon as you see this.</p>
<p>And start posting, bitch.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be scared.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be scared to post in there.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be scared to comment back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a safe goddamn space.</p>
<p>And if I see a little fucking rat in there running their mouth or being rude, I&rsquo;m booting you the fuck out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a privilege to be in our little community.</p>
<p>So be polite.</p>
<p>Check each other politely when you need to be checked.</p>
<p>Like if someone puts a situation where they&rsquo;re the asshole, politely let them know.</p>
<p>But if someone&rsquo;s in there just talking shit or dogging you, I&rsquo;m going to boot them the fuck out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not playing no bullying shit.</p>
<p>And most likely we&rsquo;re going to bully them back.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s our community.</p>
<p>We can do whatever the fuck we want.</p>
<p>But like I said, don&rsquo;t be scared to post in there.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be scared to be vulnerable.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be scared to be vulnerable because it&rsquo;s just a community of people who fucking get it.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re all there for each other.</p>
<p>We all understand our emotions.</p>
<p>We understand how to be there for each other.</p>
<p>We all know how to comfort people.</p>
<p>We all listen to this.</p>
<p>Like all of you have like an advanced level of awareness.</p>
<p>So I want to make a little place where we can all hang out.</p>
<p>So the link is in the description to join it.</p>
<p>Go fucking join it.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>And post in there.</p>
<p>Shoot shit.</p>
<p>Make some friends.</p>
<p>Talk to some people and give some advice.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll be in there too, like I said.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be watching you.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be watching for these little motherfuckers that want to bully people that I care about.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re done for.</p>
<p>But anyway, let&rsquo;s jump into how to not get attached to people so quickly.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve got you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a list of tips and some situations and some things.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to have to be vulnerable and share some of my personal shit.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m going to do it because it&rsquo;s going to benefit you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to embarrass the fuck out of me.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s going to benefit you.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll share it.</p>
<p>So with not getting attached to people too fast, it&rsquo;s totally normal to get excited by someone new.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s a friend or like someone you&rsquo;re interested in to date.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s totally normal to be excited about it.</p>
<p>And be like, oh my god, like you&rsquo;re going to feel a lot of things.</p>
<p>And my punk ass used to take it too fucking far.</p>
<p>Like I said, like I would be attached to you immediately.</p>
<p>And then I would feel like a sense of betrayal when someone didn&rsquo;t like me back.</p>
<p>Or they didn&rsquo;t like live up to the image I just like made up in my head of them.</p>
<p>And like what we could be.</p>
<p>Like I would hurt my own fucking feelings all the time.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;d feel betrayed.</p>
<p>Like how did you not like me this much?</p>
<p>Like we were supposed to be together.</p>
<p>Like as soon as I decide that I like you, whether I told you or not.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want you talking to nobody else.</p>
<p>Not a single soul, bitch.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t look at nobody but me.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t talk to nobody but me.</p>
<p>You better only love me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of kidding, but like I&rsquo;m kind of not.</p>
<p>Like I still am very like territorial.</p>
<p>And like if I like you, I&rsquo;m going to get upset by every fucking thing you do.</p>
<p>But these are my ways to kind of like knock this out.</p>
<p>So my first two little tips.</p>
<p>The first one is be realistic.</p>
<p>What is the situation at hand?</p>
<p>Like what is going on right now?</p>
<p>Like let&rsquo;s say I just met some person.</p>
<p>And I like feel all these things about them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, oh my God, they could be the one.</p>
<p>Like you know how your brain just kind of like flips into like overdrive</p>
<p>and starts convincing you of all this shit and makes things bigger than it is?</p>
<p>This is going to help you stop that and like re-let the fuck back in.</p>
<p>Because don&rsquo;t go too far.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to hurt your own feelings like I do, okay?</p>
<p>Just trust me.</p>
<p>Get realistic about what the situation is at hand.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you meet someone and you&rsquo;re super attracted to them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re super interested in them.</p>
<p>You feel very drawn to them.</p>
<p>You like them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re obsessed with them.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s how I get.</p>
<p>Like I will be obsessed with someone in like ten seconds.</p>
<p>I would say five.</p>
<p>But ten seconds.</p>
<p>It takes me to know if I&rsquo;m obsessed with you or not.</p>
<p>And I have a weird thing where like I can feel people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it.</p>
<p>But like I can just feel someone&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s their energy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s their heart.</p>
<p>But I know intentions and I can feel it.</p>
<p>Like I can feel who people are at the core.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like if I look into someone&rsquo;s face, I can see like the wall.</p>
<p>And then I can see what&rsquo;s behind it.</p>
<p>Like I see people for who they are and it scares the fuck out of people.</p>
<p>Like my friends, when we have like deep conversations, and any of the people that I coach one-on-one,</p>
<p>like they understand I just know shit I&rsquo;m not supposed to know.</p>
<p>And I see things I&rsquo;m not supposed to see.</p>
<p>Like my friend Randy and me had a talk the other night.</p>
<p>And I was like looking in his eyes.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, can you stop looking at me?</p>
<p>I feel like you&rsquo;re looking into my soul.</p>
<p>I just have this thing I can do that.</p>
<p>Like I just like see past everything and then I see everything unfold.</p>
<p>Like when someone describes a situation that they&rsquo;re in or what they&rsquo;re feeling,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I can automatically just like see everything that unfolded to get them there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the weirdest fucking shit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s intuition.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s clairvoyance.</p>
<p>But I love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>But it hurts my feelings a lot.</p>
<p>Because like I said, I can see through people.</p>
<p>But back on track with being realistic about someone.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you meet someone and you feel all these things toward them.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re obsessed with them.</p>
<p>You like them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like oh my god.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like everything you want.</p>
<p>You enjoy being around them.</p>
<p>Get realistic with the situation.</p>
<p>What is going on currently?</p>
<p>Like I just met someone.</p>
<p>I see a lot of things in them that I like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in them.</p>
<p>I care to get to know them.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know them yet.</p>
<p>Like you feel all these strong emotions toward somebody.</p>
<p>You still don&rsquo;t know who the fuck that is.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>And it seems kind of like mean to say.</p>
<p>But you can meet someone and feel some things there.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But to immediately be like I love you.</p>
<p>I care about you.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know them to care about them.</p>
<p>You can care about their well-being.</p>
<p>You can be interested in them.</p>
<p>You can like things about them.</p>
<p>You can appreciate things about them.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not just in love with them.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t immediately just care about them.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t immediately just like have a grip on your heart.</p>
<p>I know it feels like that sometimes.</p>
<p>But I want to set your mind at ease from that.</p>
<p>Like get realistic with the situation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve just met bags.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Like step one was a situation at hand.</p>
<p>You met this person you feel strong feelings for.</p>
<p>You feel like you appreciate a lot of things about them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re attracted to them.</p>
<p>You like them.</p>
<p>You want to get to know them.</p>
<p>You feel drawn to them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all fine things to communicate.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on inside you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all the shit that&rsquo;s like running around in your brain and in your little heart.</p>
<p>But getting clear with the situation at hand is going to help you kind of like get back in the moment</p>
<p>and detach your brain from like going forward and like running with the fucking story of like,</p>
<p>oh, my God, what this could be.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s like if you just let yourself meet someone,</p>
<p>you meet them a couple of times, whatever it is,</p>
<p>and then you automatically start assuming like, oh, my God, we&rsquo;re going to date.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to that.</p>
<p>And then you find out they&rsquo;re talking to somebody else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like stab in the heart.</p>
<p>Bitch, I know it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been there.</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t assume shit.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really what it does.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like getting clear on what the situation is and like speaking it to yourself of like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just met this person.</p>
<p>I feel these vibes.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>It like knocks out all of your assumptions of how things are going to go,</p>
<p>and it kind of removes your expectations of like what&rsquo;s going to come from the situation.</p>
<p>Because if you immediately meet somebody and you like them a lot</p>
<p>and you like convince yourself of a certain thing or something&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t behave accordingly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to fuck with you.</p>
<p>Like when I like somebody and I haven&rsquo;t said anything yet,</p>
<p>but I really like somebody at a party or some shit,</p>
<p>like I meet someone out and I really, really like them,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t know me yet and they&rsquo;re like talking to other people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re floating around the party.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing whatever they want.</p>
<p>Old me would have secretly been like, what the fuck?</p>
<p>Like pissed off, like butthurt that you&rsquo;re not like coming up to me.</p>
<p>Like, don&rsquo;t you know that I love you?</p>
<p>I wish I was being fucking dramatic, but I used to get attached to people quick.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a big thing is just get in the reality of the situation.</p>
<p>What is actually going on right now?</p>
<p>Not what could happen, not what should happen,</p>
<p>because your expectations are going to get caught up into it too.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re not going to expect them to behave a certain way or do anything.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to keep you from feeling betrayed.</p>
<p>Like so just get clear what the fuck is going on right now.</p>
<p>My next tip, tip number two,</p>
<p>is once you already like are getting to know someone</p>
<p>and you feel like you&rsquo;re getting attached very quickly,</p>
<p>this is my go-to fucking tip to check myself.</p>
<p>And I have one of these personally.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m about to talk about is a boyfriend scoreboard.</p>
<p>I literally have a fucking scoreboard for every guy that I meet</p>
<p>that I might be interested in.</p>
<p>I have an entire list of every single trait</p>
<p>that I would have in my ideal partner.</p>
<p>Like everything I want in a partner,</p>
<p>I have, it&rsquo;s a literal like three or four page word document.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s long as fuck.</p>
<p>And what I do with this document is every guy that I meet,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make them their own copy of it.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll put, like it&rsquo;s in a table.</p>
<p>So like everything that I want is listed here.</p>
<p>And then their name is at the top.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a blank checkbox on the side.</p>
<p>Everything that they are, I&rsquo;ll check it off.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ll put an X in the thing that everything that they are.</p>
<p>And having the scoreboard with like everything that I want in a person,</p>
<p>when you feel like you like someone a lot</p>
<p>or you feel like something&rsquo;s like going on very strong,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, oh my God, this is going to put you in the reality</p>
<p>of who the fuck is in front of you and what you&rsquo;re dealing with.</p>
<p>Because your emotions will misguide you.</p>
<p>They will make you feel like you&rsquo;re up this person&rsquo;s ass.</p>
<p>Like obsessed with them more than you actually are or should be.</p>
<p>So this is a good like a reality check.</p>
<p>So I literally will score each guy I&rsquo;m potentially interested in</p>
<p>against my scoreboard.</p>
<p>And I see how much you fill in.</p>
<p>And I have a promise to myself,</p>
<p>I will not trip over somebody who does not fill out the scoreboard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to let myself get upset over them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to let myself freak out because they&rsquo;re not what I want.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll entertain it. I&rsquo;ll have fun with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll see how much they fill it out.</p>
<p>If they fill it out most of the way,</p>
<p>eh, we&rsquo;re going to take some leeway.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to like go for the bitch.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not fully going to let myself like freak out</p>
<p>or like bug out over someone</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t at least fill in like 90% of my scoreboard.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a lot of shit on there, girl.</p>
<p>But doing this will help you see the person in front of you.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re going to be convinced</p>
<p>and like blinded by your emotions</p>
<p>thinking that they&rsquo;re so great.</p>
<p>But when you put them on paper next to everything you want in a partner,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to see,</p>
<p>oh fuck, like they don&rsquo;t actually match up</p>
<p>as much as I thought.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to kill some of that excitement,</p>
<p>which is good.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s going to make you hesitate</p>
<p>with feeling so attached to them.</p>
<p>And I know that&rsquo;s kind of like fucked up</p>
<p>and like, what&rsquo;s it called, cynical?</p>
<p>Is that the word?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like putting a negative nelly.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s putting a damper on things when you do that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a good reality check</p>
<p>when you feel yourself getting attached too quick</p>
<p>or you feel like you&rsquo;re moving too fast</p>
<p>or you feel too strongly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good reality check because it&rsquo;s not being negative.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s being realistic.</p>
<p>What the fuck&rsquo;s actually going on here?</p>
<p>Because you can sit here and play in your emotions</p>
<p>in the way that you feel all you want.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to fuck you up, alright?</p>
<p>So put the motherfucker next to your scoreboard.</p>
<p>Make a full list of everything you want in a partner</p>
<p>and then score them against it.</p>
<p>Or a girlfriend&rsquo;s scoreboard.</p>
<p>Or a VVM scoreboard.</p>
<p>Whatever you&rsquo;re fucking into.</p>
<p>Make a little scoreboard and score this person up</p>
<p>against everything that you want in a partner.</p>
<p>And the next tip I have about reality of something</p>
<p>is what I&rsquo;m going to talk about.</p>
<p>A situation I recently went through</p>
<p>where I got a crush on a straight boy.</p>
<p>So after you face reality,</p>
<p>you see what the situation is for what it is.</p>
<p>You make a scoreboard.</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t make the boyfriend&rsquo;s scoreboard, whatever.</p>
<p>Assess the situation.</p>
<p>Tell yourself what is actually going on.</p>
<p>Get in the reality of it.</p>
<p>And then you have to assess,</p>
<p>are we actually even compatible?</p>
<p>What actually could come from this?</p>
<p>Because I met someone a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>And upon meeting him,</p>
<p>I was obsessed with him.</p>
<p>I loved everything about his energy,</p>
<p>his personality. He was fun as shit.</p>
<p>He was cute. I was like, hell yeah!</p>
<p>I was down with the get down.</p>
<p>I was like, what the fuck?</p>
<p>People like this don&rsquo;t come across my path often.</p>
<p>So it caught my attention a lot.</p>
<p>I love the fuck out of this man</p>
<p>from the moment I&rsquo;ve seen him.</p>
<p>So I felt this extreme and very intense</p>
<p>interest in this dude.</p>
<p>I was like, oh my god. I was so fucking excited.</p>
<p>But I had to give myself</p>
<p>a reality check with</p>
<p>asking if we&rsquo;re actually even compatible.</p>
<p>Because the motherfucker</p>
<p>was straight.</p>
<p>Number one. Number two.</p>
<p>He does not live in this country.</p>
<p>So with those two things,</p>
<p>what the fuck am I supposed to do with that?</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>You gotta get in the reality and see if you&rsquo;re actually compatible.</p>
<p>Because one, you&rsquo;re straight.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not interested</p>
<p>in me. And two,</p>
<p>you do not fucking live in this country</p>
<p>like they were visiting.</p>
<p>Being realistic, where do I actually think</p>
<p>this will go? Bitch, it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>stop here. It&rsquo;s not fucking going nowhere.</p>
<p>But the way I used to be is I would</p>
<p>still get hopeful. I would still get excited.</p>
<p>I would allow myself to</p>
<p>start thinking I had feelings</p>
<p>for this person and get so involved</p>
<p>and then break my own heart</p>
<p>when I faced the reality that</p>
<p>he was fucking straight. Girl,</p>
<p>face that shit at the beginning and save yourself.</p>
<p>Get your emotions in check</p>
<p>and reel it in.</p>
<p>You have to accept things are what they are.</p>
<p>You really just have to accept</p>
<p>the situation for what it is and acknowledge</p>
<p>it up front. Because if you just</p>
<p>feel intensely towards someone and you just</p>
<p>put blinders on and you don&rsquo;t want to face reality</p>
<p>and you just go forward into it,</p>
<p>one day you&rsquo;re going to get too far down the line</p>
<p>involved emotionally</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re going to take those blinders off</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to have to face the reality of</p>
<p>the motherfucker&rsquo;s straight and don&rsquo;t live here.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s going to feel like a fucking dagger</p>
<p>through your chest because you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to fucking hurt ten times worse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a matter of when do you want to face the reality of it.</p>
<p>Do you want to do it after you&rsquo;re already emotionally</p>
<p>invested or do you want to go ahead and fucking</p>
<p>rip the bandaid off in the beginning</p>
<p>and face it for what it is so that you don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>hurt. And I&rsquo;m not saying this is like an</p>
<p>avoidant thing, it&rsquo;s just a realistic thing.</p>
<p>Like don&rsquo;t be scared to like people</p>
<p>and scared to like</p>
<p>fall in love and stuff. I&rsquo;ve never been in love</p>
<p>so don&rsquo;t fucking ask me about that.</p>
<p>This is not an avoidance thing. This is just</p>
<p>a reality thing. Because you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>let your emotions run wild. Like you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just like put your blinders on and like go</p>
<p>with shit. It&rsquo;s going to hurt you</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not going to lead to anything good.</p>
<p>Trust me. Been there.</p>
<p>Done that. Plenty of times.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>And another way I kind of help myself with this</p>
<p>process of like accepting what it is</p>
<p>and like accepting the compatibility is</p>
<p>like play the tape forward.</p>
<p>Play the tape forward of the situation with</p>
<p>this person. What the fuck is it going to</p>
<p>turn into? Like think</p>
<p>into the future. Not about you</p>
<p>with them. Okay? Not you together.</p>
<p>You separate. Like just look at the situation</p>
<p>and play the tape forward.</p>
<p>Add time to it. What</p>
<p>is the likely possibility like going to</p>
<p>come out of it? And</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m someone that like even</p>
<p>if this motherfucker like</p>
<p>questioned his sexuality and turned out</p>
<p>to be gay and wanted to come out,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not willing to get with</p>
<p>someone who is freshly out. You gotta</p>
<p>go fuck around and explore and go</p>
<p>get in touch with yourself and do all that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not being no one&rsquo;s fucking like hand</p>
<p>holder and like leading them through this</p>
<p>shit. They need to go experience</p>
<p>things and then want to settle down for</p>
<p>a relationship. Like to live your life</p>
<p>hiding with your sexuality and then you finally get the</p>
<p>freedom to explore it and expect to just jump</p>
<p>into a relationship with someone is unrealistic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not willing to take that chance.</p>
<p>Depends.</p>
<p>Cause I don&rsquo;t ever know who&rsquo;s going to come across my path.</p>
<p>And if you write one motherfucker, I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>But I will fucking hit you.</p>
<p>But play the tape forward. Even if he did come out,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want to go for it.</p>
<p>Like you need to go do your shit and explore</p>
<p>and experience things so that you know</p>
<p>what you want in a relationship, one. And two,</p>
<p>know what your type is. Know what you&rsquo;re into sexually.</p>
<p>You gotta go play around. You gotta go try</p>
<p>all that out. And then you can come back.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not compatible. It&rsquo;s not going to go nowhere.</p>
<p>So adding time to the</p>
<p>situation and adding like other possibilities,</p>
<p>I saw that in reality it&rsquo;s not going</p>
<p>to work. There&rsquo;s like not really any chance</p>
<p>for it to. So even if he is straight</p>
<p>it ain&rsquo;t going to work. Even if he is gay, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not into that. I&rsquo;m not going to go down that</p>
<p>road with you if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just discovering your sexuality.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m too grown for</p>
<p>that shit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that makes sense or not.</p>
<p>Like is it that I&rsquo;m grown or is it just that I</p>
<p>fucking know better? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So my next tip with not getting</p>
<p>attached to someone that you&rsquo;ve just met.</p>
<p>Like this is someone that you&rsquo;ve met recently</p>
<p>or you don&rsquo;t know that well.</p>
<p>Right there. You don&rsquo;t know them that well.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t fucking know them.</p>
<p>So get to know them.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just start assuming that they like</p>
<p>you as much as you do. Don&rsquo;t just start assuming</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re compatible. Like if I meet a dude</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s gay and he&rsquo;s my type and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>his type and it&rsquo;s like great, okay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still so much to explore</p>
<p>about each other to see if we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually compatible. What are you like</p>
<p>emotionally? What are you like physically? What are you like</p>
<p>sexually? There&rsquo;s so much to discover.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many things that can make you</p>
<p>incompatible besides just like</p>
<p>sex, sexuality, and like</p>
<p>physical appearance. There&rsquo;s so much more</p>
<p>that you have to discover about a person.</p>
<p>If you have like some weird quirks or if you snore,</p>
<p>no, it&rsquo;s not happening. I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sleeping with earplugs and I&rsquo;m not dealing with no</p>
<p>in my fucking ear when I&rsquo;m sleeping.</p>
<p>My sleep is very important to me. Don&rsquo;t fuck with it.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s so many different aspects</p>
<p>you need to assess and evaluate</p>
<p>if you actually are gonna</p>
<p>work out with this person. So</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re getting to know someone, you have to</p>
<p>understand you have to get to know them first.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a fucking stranger.</p>
<p>You have to realize that. I don&rsquo;t care how</p>
<p>strongly you feel about someone.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still a fucking stranger. They&rsquo;re still someone you have to</p>
<p>learn. Like my best friend Alyssa.</p>
<p>I met her when I first moved to Houston</p>
<p>and from the moment</p>
<p>that we fucking met. It was like me, her,</p>
<p>and my friend Randy. It&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re the little trio.</p>
<p>Like we met and we all</p>
<p>meshed so well.</p>
<p>So fucking fast. Like we became</p>
<p>so close and we were so</p>
<p>comfortable after just spending like</p>
<p>10 minutes together. It was like I knew them</p>
<p>my whole fucking life. Like my nipples are hard and I</p>
<p>have the chills talking about it because it freaks me the fuck out.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re so close</p>
<p>so fast and we felt so comfortable</p>
<p>with each other so fast.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something I hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>experienced before and my like</p>
<p>red flags and like my trust issues were not</p>
<p>flaring up. Like typically they do.</p>
<p>So it was very weird to me</p>
<p>that I felt so trusting</p>
<p>of these people I had literally known</p>
<p>for 24 hours. It was the strangest</p>
<p>fucking experience. But we&rsquo;re all very tight</p>
<p>today. Like they&rsquo;re my two best friends. I have a lot</p>
<p>of other close friends but like</p>
<p>the closeness shit that happened.</p>
<p>Why y&rsquo;all moving the trash can right now?</p>
<p>Why y&rsquo;all gotta move the trash can right fucking now?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making a podcast.</p>
<p>Thank you for doing your</p>
<p>job. It just wasn&rsquo;t a convenient time for me.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Back to my fucking little thing. I felt so</p>
<p>close to these people so fast.</p>
<p>But I had to remind myself, Leo</p>
<p>yes you&rsquo;re friends with them.</p>
<p>Yes you feel very close with them and very</p>
<p>comfortable with them. And you guys</p>
<p>work together so well. All your energies</p>
<p>blend. Like they&rsquo;re socially aware.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re emotionally aware. Like they just fucking</p>
<p>get it. And</p>
<p>I had to remind myself, yes you feel</p>
<p>this way toward them but at the same time</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t fucking know</p>
<p>them. Though I talk about testing</p>
<p>people a lot. I test everybody.</p>
<p>Like I test a lot of different things.</p>
<p>I do things to test if people are gonna steal</p>
<p>from me. I do things to test their intentions.</p>
<p>I do things to test what type of person they are</p>
<p>and their character. Like I have all kind of tests.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll probably do an episode about like ways that</p>
<p>I test people because y&rsquo;all need to start doing it.</p>
<p>But I still have</p>
<p>to get to know</p>
<p>Randy and Alyssa. Like I have to get to</p>
<p>know them even though I feel like</p>
<p>so close to them so fast. And the same thing</p>
<p>happened with my friend David. It was fucking strange.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying. You still have to protect</p>
<p>yourself and watch your own fucking ass</p>
<p>and just understand you have to get</p>
<p>to know this person. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>care how good you feel about them. You don&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>know them. Alright?</p>
<p>And being too trusting</p>
<p>and being too like</p>
<p>hopeful and having too good of a heart</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>will fuck you.</p>
<p>It will.</p>
<p>I wish that wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>true. But I have too many experiences</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>giving people the benefit of the doubt</p>
<p>and they fuck me over.</p>
<p>I have no experience</p>
<p>of giving someone the benefit of the doubt</p>
<p>and them doing me right.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>my own situation and my own experiences</p>
<p>and my own like limiting shit</p>
<p>like my perception of the thing but</p>
<p>you have to watch your own fucking ass and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>care how good you feel about somebody. You have</p>
<p>to get to know them first. I&rsquo;m just gonna leave it there</p>
<p>because if you haven&rsquo;t had that experience</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy for you and I don&rsquo;t want to speak like</p>
<p>fear into you but</p>
<p>I will speak reality at you</p>
<p>of like you don&rsquo;t know people regardless</p>
<p>how good you feel about them or how much you feel</p>
<p>like you know them because I felt like I knew these motherfuckers</p>
<p>my whole life. But I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I had to remind myself of that. Of like okay Leo</p>
<p>you got the feelings but you have to have</p>
<p>the logic too. You have to CYA</p>
<p>cover your ass. And this whole</p>
<p>get to know them situation applies</p>
<p>to people that you&rsquo;ve also</p>
<p>already known. So like let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>friends with someone for a while and you guys are</p>
<p>pursuing a relationship or you&rsquo;re pursuing something</p>
<p>more than a friendship.</p>
<p>Who you know of them is who they</p>
<p>are as a friend. You don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know who they are in a relationship.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know how they are in a relationship. So</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another thing you have to check yourself on.</p>
<p>You might know this person</p>
<p>but this is a whole other side you&rsquo;re going to have to</p>
<p>get to learn if you&rsquo;re going to take it farther than a friendship.</p>
<p>You have to get to know who they are in a relationship</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;re going to treat you, what&rsquo;s going to change</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to shift. They&rsquo;re a whole different</p>
<p>fucking person. So I want you to look at it</p>
<p>like that. So you don&rsquo;t go into it</p>
<p>thinking of like certain expectations</p>
<p>you have of them as a friend and then throw</p>
<p>it into the relationship because it might set you up</p>
<p>for disappointment. But you have to</p>
<p>get to know people in the new</p>
<p>role. So like if you have a friend that you&rsquo;re switching</p>
<p>to a relationship you have to take on</p>
<p>the attitude of like I&rsquo;m getting to know this</p>
<p>new side of you. I&rsquo;m getting to know</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s like to experience you in this way.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another reminder.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care how long you&rsquo;ve been friends with someone</p>
<p>you have to get to know them in a relationship also.</p>
<p>So just keep your eyes open with that and</p>
<p>like remind yourself you have to get to know them</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re not as attached as you feel.</p>
<p>And with</p>
<p>me saying you&rsquo;re not as attached as you feel</p>
<p>bitch look at the time</p>
<p>look at the fucking time</p>
<p>of how long you&rsquo;ve known this person.</p>
<p>Like when I met Randy and Alyssa</p>
<p>and we hung out for like the first weekend together</p>
<p>I knew them two days.</p>
<p>And I felt so strongly connected</p>
<p>to them and I was like oh my god</p>
<p>if I lost them I&rsquo;d be sad.</p>
<p>But if I lost them would</p>
<p>I be that fucked up and that</p>
<p>damaged by it? No girl.</p>
<p>I knew them for two fucking days. Luckily</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re still friends. We&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>friends. We&rsquo;re all very close. We&rsquo;re all very good. But</p>
<p>my point is like the time thing. You have</p>
<p>to check yourself. Like</p>
<p>how long have you actually known them? How long have you</p>
<p>actually had a crush on them? Like</p>
<p>look at this shit like for real.</p>
<p>Like be fucking for real. BFFR.</p>
<p>Leon what the fuck?</p>
<p>So my next tip for not getting too attached too</p>
<p>quick is do not tie anything</p>
<p>up with this person. Like</p>
<p>make their ability to live your</p>
<p>life seamless</p>
<p>and easy</p>
<p>for a good while. I want</p>
<p>to say like six months but</p>
<p>I know people are going to freak the fuck out if I say that</p>
<p>but like I&rsquo;m not saying do this</p>
<p>as like an avoidant attachment</p>
<p>style thing. Hi.</p>
<p>But do this to protect</p>
<p>your own ass and like to cover</p>
<p>your own bases.</p>
<p>Like don&rsquo;t get too</p>
<p>enmeshed and like legally</p>
<p>associated and like</p>
<p>involved. Like don&rsquo;t be making</p>
<p>no fucking commitments of like getting a</p>
<p>house together. Getting married. Signing</p>
<p>a fucking lease together. Don&rsquo;t mesh</p>
<p>anything that&rsquo;s going to bind</p>
<p>them to you and make shit difficult</p>
<p>if you guys do agree to leave.</p>
<p>Because like I said you&rsquo;re still getting to know each other.</p>
<p>You still have to assess so many things</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re compatible or not. So if you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>committed to a fucking lease and you&rsquo;re going to move in together</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve moved into an apartment after three months. That&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>the gays work. We move fast.</p>
<p>But if you commit to all that</p>
<p>and then you realize okay this person&rsquo;s not actually</p>
<p>like who I thought they was</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m not actually as into them as I</p>
<p>thought or we&rsquo;re not compatible.</p>
<p>What you going to do now bitch?</p>
<p>Now leaving is going to be ten times harder.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d say give it a minute.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll know when. Because a</p>
<p>situation you won&rsquo;t be making a decision</p>
<p>off of your emotion. You&rsquo;ll be making a decision</p>
<p>off of logic. And those</p>
<p>are the decisions to make. Like if you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>known someone for a month don&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>buy a house with them. Unless it&rsquo;s a sugar daddy</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re putting it in your name. Let them buy you a house.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>go get yourself like tied up with people too</p>
<p>quick. That&rsquo;s going to make you feel a lot</p>
<p>more attached a lot quicker. Because</p>
<p>when you move quicker and you do a lot of</p>
<p>important things it makes you feel more attached.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re setting this foundation of like</p>
<p>security and stability with a motherfucker you barely</p>
<p>know. That&rsquo;s going to trick your brain into</p>
<p>thinking you&rsquo;re way more attached and you care about them</p>
<p>way more than you think. So slow it down</p>
<p>bitch. Hold the voice. Okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one to talk though.</p>
<p>Because I like to move quick.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m very certain and sure.</p>
<p>And I know how to judge people&rsquo;s character</p>
<p>and like you know. Well it&rsquo;s not about me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really fucking not. Let me shut up.</p>
<p>But let me just reiterate my point. Make it</p>
<p>as easy as possible for you to</p>
<p>walk away for at least the first</p>
<p>like six months.</p>
<p>Three or four if you can bitch.</p>
<p>Okay? But you still don&rsquo;t know someone that well.</p>
<p>Like you have to see a lot about a person</p>
<p>to decide that you actually know them.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t get involved</p>
<p>with them. Don&rsquo;t do shit too quick</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to bind you to them. Allow for the</p>
<p>potential of you guys splitting to be as easy as</p>
<p>possible. Just remember me saying that.</p>
<p>For like a little bit.</p>
<p>So the next thing I want to talk about is before you do</p>
<p>something for the person that you like</p>
<p>you gotta cut all the</p>
<p>strings that you have attached to it.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t want to do something for someone with hidden</p>
<p>expectations or hidden hopes or like</p>
<p>anything like that. So a way to weed</p>
<p>that out is ask yourself</p>
<p>before you buy them a gift, before you</p>
<p>book a trip with them, before you do</p>
<p>anything for them or like</p>
<p>with them.</p>
<p>Ask yourself. If we</p>
<p>were to split up and break</p>
<p>up after this, would</p>
<p>I still feel comfortable doing it?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;ll know if you actually want</p>
<p>to do something and if you feel comfortable doing it.</p>
<p>Because a lot of people only like to do</p>
<p>shit with the thought of like, oh, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>investing in the relationship.</p>
<p>But you have to see</p>
<p>are you willing to invest in the person</p>
<p>not the relationship. Don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>anything for them if you&rsquo;re not willing</p>
<p>to do it for them and their well-being</p>
<p>and their happiness. Don&rsquo;t invest shit</p>
<p>or do shit if you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be comfortable with them still having</p>
<p>it if they walk away or if you guys</p>
<p>split up. Like that&rsquo;s just a thing to</p>
<p>protect you and also to protect</p>
<p>you from doing things that will lead you to feeling</p>
<p>betrayed. Because if you do shit</p>
<p>expecting like you guys stay together</p>
<p>and then you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re going to be pissed.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a good way to know</p>
<p>like if you should or shouldn&rsquo;t do something. Am I still</p>
<p>comfortable doing it even if we break up?</p>
<p>Am I still comfortable with investing this energy,</p>
<p>time, money, gift, whatever it is</p>
<p>into this person even if I don&rsquo;t get to share</p>
<p>it with them. And that&rsquo;ll bring you a lot</p>
<p>of clarity if you should do something or not.</p>
<p>Oh God. Okay, this next one&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>controversial. I</p>
<p>personally can&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m going to say is</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t cut off all of your options.</p>
<p>Like play the field a little. Like if you</p>
<p>find someone that you like and you go on a first date</p>
<p>and it goes good, like don&rsquo;t immediately cut</p>
<p>off everybody else that you&rsquo;re talking to</p>
<p>or interested in. Because it&rsquo;s going to help you not</p>
<p>like fixate on them.</p>
<p>Like if you meet this one</p>
<p>person and everything goes good</p>
<p>for like the beginning and you&rsquo;re just like,</p>
<p>you have nothing else going on, you&rsquo;re just going to be fixated</p>
<p>on them and you&rsquo;re going to put all of your hope</p>
<p>and effort into like making that work.</p>
<p>And if it doesn&rsquo;t work, it&rsquo;s going to feel a lot more devastating.</p>
<p>But I personally cannot</p>
<p>do this. I don&rsquo;t talk to people</p>
<p>like that. If I find someone</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in, I&rsquo;m 100% there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to split my focus and my attention.</p>
<p>But a lot of people like to date around.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re someone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s comfortable with like dating around and having</p>
<p>a lot of options, do it</p>
<p>until it gets to a point where you&rsquo;re ready</p>
<p>and certain like, okay, this is the person. Then cut</p>
<p>everybody else off. Don&rsquo;t do anything disrespectful.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re not the type</p>
<p>like me to</p>
<p>have a lot of options at once,</p>
<p>I want you to stay fucking</p>
<p>busy. And that&rsquo;s my next tip is</p>
<p>stay busy with what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>in your life. Like keep</p>
<p>yourself and your goals your priority.</p>
<p>Work on your own shit.</p>
<p>Go to your fucking job. Do what you need</p>
<p>to do for you. Take care of yourself. Keep going with</p>
<p>your fitness goals. Keep going with whatever goals you</p>
<p>have, whatever you like to do. Stay</p>
<p>consistent with it and keep doing it.</p>
<p>Like maybe do a little bit more because</p>
<p>when you find someone that you&rsquo;re really interested</p>
<p>in, if you hyper fixate</p>
<p>on them, every little move they</p>
<p>make is going to fucking hurt. It&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to like hurt your little heart. Like God</p>
<p>forbid they don&rsquo;t answer your text fast enough or like</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t answer your text all day</p>
<p>because they got busy. It&rsquo;s like, oh my God, what have I done</p>
<p>wrong? Like I get it. I get it, bitch.</p>
<p>I was like that. So staying</p>
<p>busy and staying in your own shit is going to allow</p>
<p>you to not like hyper fixate on</p>
<p>every move that they make. Like every little action</p>
<p>that they do, if you don&rsquo;t have anything going</p>
<p>on for yourself and anything that you&rsquo;re doing, all</p>
<p>you have to do is sit here and overanalyze</p>
<p>everything and it will hurt the fuck out of you if you do</p>
<p>it. Stay busy with your own shit.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t overanalyze every text,</p>
<p>every move, every everything. Like by being</p>
<p>busy, you have less effort</p>
<p>to shove into them and like</p>
<p>watching every move that they make and</p>
<p>like how they might not like you and then oh they</p>
<p>do like me and they don&rsquo;t like me. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t go through all that mental fucking turmoil.</p>
<p>Stay consistent with what you&rsquo;re doing. Stay busy.</p>
<p>Allow yourself to have other things to</p>
<p>focus on and not just them. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>totally fine to be excited by them. It&rsquo;s totally</p>
<p>fine to go for them</p>
<p>and like put your effort and energy into them, but</p>
<p>like have other shit you&rsquo;re doing that with also</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t one, lose</p>
<p>yourself and two, hyper fixate</p>
<p>and get hurt by every little fucking like</p>
<p>slight change in behavior.</p>
<p>And my last tip, my last little point</p>
<p>I want to make is enjoy liking someone</p>
<p>and enjoy the heartbreak of it.</p>
<p>Enjoy getting your feelings hurt</p>
<p>bitch cause nothing makes me thrive more</p>
<p>than getting my feelings hurt.</p>
<p>Like when I like someone, I get</p>
<p>like a boost of energy to be</p>
<p>better, to do better, to look better, to get</p>
<p>more serious about myself, to improve myself</p>
<p>more. Like I get that nice</p>
<p>boost and like rush and inspiration.</p>
<p>So enjoy that.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s very rare</p>
<p>that I find somebody I like, but when</p>
<p>I do, I feel so good.</p>
<p>So enjoy that while you&rsquo;ve got it.</p>
<p>Like tap into it. Use it to your advantage.</p>
<p>Use it to level yourself up. Like enjoy</p>
<p>having someone there. Enjoy having</p>
<p>someone that you&rsquo;re interested by</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re like enamored by and that you just want to look</p>
<p>at and like touch and squeeze and hug.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s so fun. So just enjoy</p>
<p>that aspect of it and then also enjoy</p>
<p>the fucking heartbreak. Enjoy that shit going south.</p>
<p>Enjoy losing them</p>
<p>because everything that you</p>
<p>lose in that person is going to give you clarity</p>
<p>about everything you want in the next one. So</p>
<p>even if you lose one, you gain insight</p>
<p>about what you truly want out of a person</p>
<p>and like it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>good. It&rsquo;s going to be a good learning moment, but enjoy the heartbreak</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;ll give you that motivation</p>
<p>of like finding the next one</p>
<p>and like leveling yourself up and improving yourself.</p>
<p>Like be a selfish prick like I am.</p>
<p>Like use it to your advantage</p>
<p>because I love some emotional</p>
<p>like fucking willpower.</p>
<p>Like when I&rsquo;m upset or sad and I go</p>
<p>work out or like I start working on something, I&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>heartbroken like</p>
<p>getting so much done like fucking</p>
<p>opening new businesses and shit</p>
<p>and fucking like working out like hard as hell because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like lifting out of pure emotion. Like put on some Lana Del Rey</p>
<p>and fucking cry. Put on a little Ethel Kane</p>
<p>and fucking just like rage. Like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the best shit. So literally just</p>
<p>enjoy the process</p>
<p>of it, even if it doesn&rsquo;t go anywhere.</p>
<p>Like with the boy that was straight that didn&rsquo;t live here,</p>
<p>like I just enjoyed being</p>
<p>in his company and just I enjoyed the</p>
<p>fact that I liked him. Like I just enjoyed</p>
<p>that sensation of what it&rsquo;s like to</p>
<p>be enamored with someone.</p>
<p>And then it ended. Like homie left</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m fucking on my own shit now. Like</p>
<p>just enjoy that feeling when you&rsquo;ve got it because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nice. Okay, so now let&rsquo;s jump</p>
<p>into what would Leo do. So that&rsquo;s where you</p>
<p>guys write in and ask me for advice on your</p>
<p>situations about what I would do if I</p>
<p>was you. So the first</p>
<p>one is how can you</p>
<p>stay consistent in the gym</p>
<p>when your family doesn&rsquo;t support you?</p>
<p>So what I had</p>
<p>to understand when I started getting into</p>
<p>fitness is other people are not</p>
<p>going to get it. Your family&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not going to understand. And they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to. People do not have</p>
<p>to understand what you&rsquo;re doing for you to do</p>
<p>it. People do not have to support you</p>
<p>for you to do what you want to do.</p>
<p>If you have a goal, don&rsquo;t expect</p>
<p>people to understand. Don&rsquo;t expect people to</p>
<p>support you. It&rsquo;s nice to have support.</p>
<p>But if someone doesn&rsquo;t want to support you, don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>try and force them to. You don&rsquo;t need support.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t need people to understand</p>
<p>for you to do what you want to do.</p>
<p>So what I will say is set boundaries</p>
<p>around what your goal is.</p>
<p>So if you have a fitness goal</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re talking about, if you have</p>
<p>a certain time you&rsquo;re going to go to the gym,</p>
<p>or going to the gym is a non-negotiable</p>
<p>for you to get to where you want to go,</p>
<p>make it clear that you have a</p>
<p>boundary around, I will be spending</p>
<p>this time every day at the gym. On</p>
<p>holidays, if I decide to go to the gym,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go early or later so I can still</p>
<p>spend time with everyone. I used to do that.</p>
<p>I was in the gym every fucking holiday.</p>
<p>Because my family didn&rsquo;t really celebrate holidays.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t give a fuck. Even if it was someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>birthday. Bitch, I&rsquo;m still going to the fucking gym.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still doing my own shit. On my own birthday,</p>
<p>I go to the goddamn gym.</p>
<p>Just set boundaries around what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to do. So if working out is</p>
<p>something that you want to do, set a boundary</p>
<p>around it. You&rsquo;re going to do it. It&rsquo;s not up for</p>
<p>fucking discussion. You have a goal. You&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>work toward it. Same with eating and diet.</p>
<p>If you have a certain goal for</p>
<p>how you want to start eating, set that</p>
<p>boundary. Make it a non-negotiable.</p>
<p>People will offer you food. You don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to take it. You don&rsquo;t have to eat</p>
<p>what everybody else is eating. And I&rsquo;m Albanian.</p>
<p>So I know what that fucking</p>
<p>shit is like. My parents love to try and</p>
<p>force-feed me. My cousins be eating</p>
<p>like crazy. Maybe, do you want some? Eat some.</p>
<p>Come on. Come on. They give you a guilt trip</p>
<p>for not eating. I love it. I appreciate</p>
<p>them. But you have to have self-discipline</p>
<p>and self-control to say no.</p>
<p>You can politely say no. I appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thank you. I&rsquo;m eating clean right now. Whatever it is.</p>
<p>And after you say it a few times, they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>fucking get it. And they&rsquo;re going to shut the fuck up</p>
<p>and stop offering you shit. Because my friends be offering</p>
<p>me cookies all the time. And I&rsquo;m like, I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do it. But that&rsquo;s it. Just set</p>
<p>boundaries around what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t ask for people to</p>
<p>support you. Tell people</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d like their support. Sure.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t need their support. You&rsquo;re going to do it</p>
<p>regardless. All you need people to do</p>
<p>is respect your boundaries and not give</p>
<p>you shit. So they don&rsquo;t have to support you</p>
<p>but they can shut the fuck up and let</p>
<p>you do what you want to do. You&rsquo;re not hurting them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not ruining anything for them. You&rsquo;re not making their</p>
<p>life difficult. You&rsquo;re doing your own shit.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. And I&rsquo;m fucking proud of you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to be difficult, but</p>
<p>you got this shit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been through the same thing.</p>
<p>At 12 years old, I started getting into dieting</p>
<p>a little bit. And then 14, I started P90X</p>
<p>and working out. I didn&rsquo;t know what the fuck I was doing.</p>
<p>But my family was trying to feed</p>
<p>me certain shit. And I&rsquo;m like, no, I&rsquo;m going to have a salad.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what the fuck I was doing.</p>
<p>But I got a lot of judgment from everyone around me.</p>
<p>But I still just did it anyways.</p>
<p>Because I was the one that had to be fat, not them.</p>
<p>So I wanted to fix it.</p>
<p>And another thing with that,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m going to shut up and move to the next one,</p>
<p>is when you are around</p>
<p>people who are not doing what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing, they&rsquo;re going to make you feel weird as fuck</p>
<p>for it. So me with my diet and</p>
<p>exercise, I&rsquo;ve always felt weird</p>
<p>and other people just don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>Until I started hanging out with people and being friends</p>
<p>with people who get it. All of my</p>
<p>friends now are into fitness. They&rsquo;re all into</p>
<p>meal plans, working out, dieting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all about that shit.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t feel weird</p>
<p>at all. And when I go to their</p>
<p>houses, I can actually eat shit when I&rsquo;m there</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all healthy shit. It&rsquo;s all the same shit</p>
<p>that I eat. As soon as you get around people</p>
<p>who are doing the same thing, you&rsquo;ll feel</p>
<p>supported. You&rsquo;ll feel understood. They&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>it. But people that are not doing</p>
<p>it, you can&rsquo;t expect to feel like</p>
<p>they get it or understand</p>
<p>or going to support you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m going to say on that. It does get easier.</p>
<p>I promise. So our next situation</p>
<p>is another one about a fitness-y lifestyle.</p>
<p>Someone said, how do I eat on my</p>
<p>meal plan and not miss going out</p>
<p>to eat with friends and family?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that I have to deal with a lot.</p>
<p>Everything is about going out to eat.</p>
<p>Anytime you&rsquo;re going to hang out with someone, it&rsquo;s like, oh, let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>get food. Let&rsquo;s go get drinks. Let&rsquo;s go this. Let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>that. Everybody has to be eating something all</p>
<p>the time. And when you&rsquo;re on a meal plan, it&rsquo;s very hard</p>
<p>to do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a couple of tips that I use.</p>
<p>One is if I go to my</p>
<p>friend&rsquo;s house to hang out, I&rsquo;ll take a meal</p>
<p>with me so I can just eat it when I&rsquo;m there.</p>
<p>Another thing that I do</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;ll eat before</p>
<p>I go hang out with people.</p>
<p>Or if my friends invite me to dinner,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll eat before dinner so that</p>
<p>I have my meal in and I don&rsquo;t have to worry about fucking it up.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll go to dinner with them</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just get a water or</p>
<p>get a Diet Coke or whatever the fuck and just hang out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m there to share the experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m there in the atmosphere. We get to hang out.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to eat just because you&rsquo;re at a restaurant.</p>
<p>People might look at you like you&rsquo;re fucking weird,</p>
<p>but fuck up. Let them mind</p>
<p>their own goddamn business. You can go still</p>
<p>hang out with people and be around them</p>
<p>and not</p>
<p>fuck up your goals. But another thing that</p>
<p>I do with going out to eat, because it is</p>
<p>a little weird to sit there and just</p>
<p>not eat.</p>
<p>Something that I&rsquo;ll do, and I do this all the time.</p>
<p>You can ask anyone that fucking hangs out with me.</p>
<p>I will go eat at a restaurant</p>
<p>with a friend, but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take two protein bars</p>
<p>with me. Because that&rsquo;s 40 grams of protein.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll literally go to the restaurant</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll eat the protein bars</p>
<p>at the restaurant. And I don&rsquo;t give a fuck that people look at me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a fuck that people think it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>Yeah, I bring my goddamn protein bars to the restaurant.</p>
<p>Leave me alone. But I&rsquo;ll order a salad</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll get like whatever</p>
<p>salad that they have, but I will get</p>
<p>the dressing on the side.</p>
<p>And I usually ask if they have like oil and vinegar</p>
<p>and I get that on the side because vinegar</p>
<p>has zero calories. I don&rsquo;t put the oil</p>
<p>on it, but I&rsquo;ll put vinegar on it. But I get a salad</p>
<p>with no dressing, no</p>
<p>croutons, no cheese. It&rsquo;s literally just a plate</p>
<p>of fucking vegetables if you do that.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll put vinegar on it. And then like a little</p>
<p>salt and pepper. Whatever I want. And I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>eat my protein bars, and like I get the experience</p>
<p>of going out with</p>
<p>people, hanging out, getting to be in like</p>
<p>the restaurant atmosphere, because I love a restaurant.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t have to fuck up</p>
<p>my goals. Like I still get to go and</p>
<p>eat something, and I still get to like stay</p>
<p>on track with everything. There&rsquo;s a way to balance it.</p>
<p>I promise. People might think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little fucking weird, but</p>
<p>who gives a shit?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re the one you have to answer to.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the one that has the goals.</p>
<p>And your goals don&rsquo;t give a fuck about who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>judging the goals. It&rsquo;s like you have to do what it takes to get</p>
<p>there, so do it. Even if people</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re a little wacko. Because bitch,</p>
<p>see something, say something. Yeah, I&rsquo;m eating</p>
<p>protein bars and a salad. Who gives a fuck?</p>
<p>Okay, so the last situation</p>
<p>for what would Leo do, is this</p>
<p>person is dealing with phone addiction.</p>
<p>And when they&rsquo;re studying, like they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get on their phone. Like if something gets hard,</p>
<p>or they get bored, they just get on their phone.</p>
<p>And they get on their phone non-fucking</p>
<p>stop. And they can&rsquo;t like get off of it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fucking with every aspect of their life.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a whole emotional</p>
<p>side you can go touch on</p>
<p>with addiction, and like phone</p>
<p>addiction and distraction from like something that you</p>
<p>feel. I get it, but it sounds</p>
<p>like you just need more self-control</p>
<p>and like things</p>
<p>to navigate having more</p>
<p>discipline around it. So I&rsquo;m going to give you those.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in learning about the emotional side of addiction,</p>
<p>look it up.</p>
<p>I would do a video about it, but like</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to touch on that subject.</p>
<p>Like addiction is like</p>
<p>so touchy, and people are going to fucking try and attack</p>
<p>me for it. But my tip for studying,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to study or do</p>
<p>school work, and you keep getting on your phone,</p>
<p>babe, put your phone in</p>
<p>another fucking room while you study.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to feel uncomfortable. You&rsquo;re literally</p>
<p>going to have times, like when I used to have to study,</p>
<p>I would have all my books and shit in front of me, my laptop.</p>
<p>And then I would have like my phone</p>
<p>usually sitting here. And once I would start putting my</p>
<p>phone in another room, I would catch myself</p>
<p>like reaching for my phone and it wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>Like my body was just so used to being in the</p>
<p>habit of doing it. You&rsquo;re going to feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to feel weird. But as</p>
<p>you do it more, your brain&rsquo;s going to start to</p>
<p>associate study time. Your phone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not in the fucking room, and you allow yourself</p>
<p>to focus. But if you have your computer in front</p>
<p>of you too, watch it, bitch. Don&rsquo;t be playing</p>
<p>on other shit. You need to fucking study. But another</p>
<p>idea for like social media addiction on the phone</p>
<p>is you can set time limits</p>
<p>on your apps. So you can set</p>
<p>a certain amount of time that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>allowed to like be on social media apps throughout</p>
<p>the day. So you can set like one hour,</p>
<p>two hours, five hours, whatever you want to set it</p>
<p>as. Like let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve been on Instagram for</p>
<p>like two hours today, and your time limit is two</p>
<p>hours. It&rsquo;s then going to</p>
<p>lock all of your other social media</p>
<p>apps, or whatever ones that you add into the restriction.</p>
<p>And every time you go to open</p>
<p>the app, it&rsquo;s going to come up with a</p>
<p>screen with like a little timer on it and be like, you&rsquo;ve exceeded</p>
<p>your screen time for the day. You can</p>
<p>click OK, and it will close it, or you can click</p>
<p>Ignore, and it will let you open the app.</p>
<p>And what I found that to be so useful</p>
<p>for is a lot</p>
<p>of the times when you&rsquo;re on your phone, you&rsquo;ll just click an app</p>
<p>like out of habit, but</p>
<p>that screen puts a buffer,</p>
<p>and it puts like one step</p>
<p>extra in front of</p>
<p>your habit and your pattern of like just clicking</p>
<p>onto Instagram on your phone. It&rsquo;s like if you ever move</p>
<p>shit around on your phone, move the apps around,</p>
<p>your brain&rsquo;s going to naturally just click where Instagram</p>
<p>was, or click where TikTok was, just by</p>
<p>habit. So having that screen flash</p>
<p>up with the screen time,</p>
<p>it like breaks that moment of like</p>
<p>OK, that was just autopilot, and it puts you like</p>
<p>OK, hang on. But even if you want to</p>
<p>ignore the time limit and get on the</p>
<p>app anyways, I want you to realize</p>
<p>and remind yourself when</p>
<p>you see that screen, and you click</p>
<p>Ignore, I&rsquo;m choosing this</p>
<p>right now. Like put yourself</p>
<p>in a place of power whether you choose it or</p>
<p>not. That&rsquo;s my same idea with binge</p>
<p>eating. Put the shit in front of you</p>
<p>and choose it. Don&rsquo;t just be like</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m so powerless to my emotions.</p>
<p>Like don&rsquo;t take an unempowered</p>
<p>action. Reminding yourself that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in control puts you in a place of power</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re free to choose it if you want, but you get</p>
<p>to avoid that guilt. It&rsquo;ll also make you more</p>
<p>accountable and disciplined because if you look at</p>
<p>it like OK, here&rsquo;s my screen time limit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already exceeded what I&rsquo;ve wanted to be</p>
<p>on for the day. I can choose to</p>
<p>do it or I can choose not to. You&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>just powerless to it. Like oh, I just can&rsquo;t stop</p>
<p>scrolling. It&rsquo;s like nah bitch, you chose it.</p>
<p>So what now? Like why are you</p>
<p>going to complain when your actions are right in front of you</p>
<p>of why you&rsquo;re not getting the results that you want?</p>
<p>You see? Another tip I have</p>
<p>for social media addiction and like spending</p>
<p>too much time on it and just scrolling is</p>
<p>unfollow accounts that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fucking like. And unfollow</p>
<p>accounts that just distract you for no fucking reason.</p>
<p>Like I follow a lot of quote pages and I follow</p>
<p>a lot of people that are like my friends and influencers</p>
<p>that I like, sure. But</p>
<p>I unfollowed a lot of pages that was just like</p>
<p>mindless bullshit. Like I love a meme though.</p>
<p>I be having tons of memes. But</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m able to like control myself</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;d say if you feel like you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>unfollow a lot of pages that are just</p>
<p>mindless distraction. If it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>a motivation thing, a quote, or like something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to help you feel better</p>
<p>then don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>watch it. Don&rsquo;t like have</p>
<p>everything that you enjoy so much</p>
<p>readily available to you. Like just kind</p>
<p>of like cut back on it because you&rsquo;ll start</p>
<p>opening your phone and be like, eh, I&rsquo;m bored. And then you&rsquo;ll close</p>
<p>it. And then you have to find something else to do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s my next tip.</p>
<p>Is if you&rsquo;re going to set a time limit for how much</p>
<p>you can be on your phone, do not</p>
<p>just expect yourself to quit doing</p>
<p>something without something else to</p>
<p>like fill it in or take up your attention.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re used to spending it on social media</p>
<p>and then you have nothing to do now</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just sitting here like expecting</p>
<p>yourself to be fine with it, you&rsquo;re most likely</p>
<p>going to jump back into it. So have something</p>
<p>else planned that you want to do. Get busy with something</p>
<p>else. I don&rsquo;t want to say read</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s so fucking cliche.</p>
<p>But like go read, go do something like</p>
<p>go watch a different type of YouTube video.</p>
<p>Go watch some self-development shit. Like go watch</p>
<p>something that is going to help you</p>
<p>with what you&rsquo;re doing and not just</p>
<p>be mindless social media. Because you can use</p>
<p>social media to learn things. Like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>certain YouTube videos where while</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m eating, I love to watch a YouTube video.</p>
<p>Every fucking meal of the day, I like to have</p>
<p>a YouTube video and I like to watch it while I eat. I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been like that since I can remember since I&rsquo;m little. I grew up on</p>
<p>YouTube. But, oh my god,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on YouTube now. Hey, if you&rsquo;re eating.</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m watching videos on YouTube, sometimes</p>
<p>I like like mindless shit</p>
<p>and then sometimes I like things that</p>
<p>are like business related or like coaching</p>
<p>related or like psychology related.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll allow myself to watch these videos</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t beat myself up mentally because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>learning something from them. So I still</p>
<p>get to be on social media and like be entertained</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not useless</p>
<p>like mindless social media.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another thing that I would suggest.</p>
<p>But also give yourself something else to do</p>
<p>or watch and like something else to do with your</p>
<p>time. Like studying or like whatever you</p>
<p>need to fucking get done. Go to the gym. Go on a god damn walk.</p>
<p>Listen to some music. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Give yourself something else to do to occupy your</p>
<p>time because you</p>
<p>have a known way of</p>
<p>filling like voids and</p>
<p>like empty time slots in your</p>
<p>day. So if you just remove</p>
<p>that, you&rsquo;re going to be faced with what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>running from. So have</p>
<p>something else that&rsquo;s like more productive or more</p>
<p>healthy that will help you</p>
<p>to do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I got for What Would Leo Do. If you want to be</p>
