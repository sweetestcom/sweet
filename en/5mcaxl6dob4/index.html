<p>and you&rsquo;re on with Dr Berg</p>
<p>hello I can&rsquo;t tell you how excited I am</p>
<p>and if you would please tell Karen and</p>
<p>your daughter the recipes are fabulous</p>
<p>my husband&rsquo;s very happy</p>
<p>um but I don&rsquo;t think you want me to list</p>
<p>hopefully you have what I sent in I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think you want me to list</p>
<p>everything that I&rsquo;m taking but my</p>
<p>question is with my health improving do</p>
<p>I really need to keep taking everything</p>
<p>or do you take it you know maybe less a</p>
<p>week or every other day or you know that</p>
<p>kind of thing I&rsquo;m just not sure if I</p>
<p>should just keep taking everything</p>
<p>forever</p>
<p>yeah that is a that&rsquo;s a very good</p>
<p>question it&rsquo;s really hard to know that</p>
<p>um without getting a lot more</p>
<p>information about let&rsquo;s say um</p>
<p>your weaknesses</p>
<p>um one thing that I&rsquo;m doing a deep dive</p>
<p>now is on genetics which um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of confusion and uh but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s tests that you can do to find</p>
<p>out</p>
<p>um maybe where you have</p>
<p>um some susceptibility to certain</p>
<p>problems in which case yeah you want to</p>
<p>be staying on certain things long term</p>
<p>especially if they&rsquo;re like related to</p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acids something related to</p>
<p>maybe detoxifying the liver</p>
<p>um but you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s I think a good</p>
<p>way to um</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend taking like just a ton</p>
<p>of things all the time so what you might</p>
<p>want to do is as you get better</p>
<p>you know omit one at a time and just see</p>
<p>how you feel and see if you&rsquo;re like oh</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling great um there are other</p>
<p>things especially if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>fasting you know like the electrolytes</p>
<p>and B vitamins that are kind of like a</p>
<p>requirement</p>
<p>um and other things that are hard to get</p>
<p>like vitamin D but you know there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>other things that should not be taken</p>
<p>long term the goal is to get your body</p>
<p>into a state of uh Power where it can</p>
<p>handle</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>a lot a lot of stress and you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to take all these you know nutritional</p>
<p>things but the problem is that trying to</p>
<p>find food that will give you everything</p>
<p>is not easy as well</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s another factor and then the</p>
<p>other one is like how close are you</p>
<p>following the diet how close are you</p>
<p>um how good are you with your habits</p>
<p>like you know</p>
<p>um we have some people that drink a lot</p>
<p>of alcohol other people that have these</p>
<p>cheat days so these are all factors to</p>
<p>look at I guess</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m not really answering your</p>
<p>question but I&rsquo;m just kind of giving you</p>
<p>a some things to think with</p>
<p>no that really kind of does because for</p>
<p>example I had</p>
<p>um fatty liver and I had sleep apnea and</p>
<p>I had gallstones and everybody tells you</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get rid of gallstones well</p>
<p>your gallbladder support and your trace</p>
<p>minerals I did get rid of gallstones so</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s kind of like wow and so in</p>
<p>that sense for example since I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have gallstones anymore do I need to</p>
<p>keep taking both of those or should I</p>
<p>just take all the trace minerals and</p>
<p>maybe take the gallbladder support like</p>
<p>every other day I mean I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>that works or not yeah that does work I</p>
<p>would I would try to uh start weaning</p>
<p>off things and just test the waters it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely going to be a</p>
<p>testing the waters so you see here&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>of the big problems that I ran into when</p>
<p>I started getting into nutrition I</p>
<p>started going to all these seminars</p>
<p>right and nutrition is great</p>
<p>because it has less side effects but</p>
<p>most</p>
<p>um most of the methods of teaching how</p>
<p>to use nutrition are are like oh just</p>
<p>matching a nutrient with a symptom</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not like correlating all the</p>
<p>data connecting all the dots and going</p>
<p>okay what&rsquo;s really causing the</p>
<p>underlying problem and that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>I keep pushing this idea</p>
<p>um before someone starts loading up in a</p>
<p>bunch of supplements make sure you get</p>
<p>this basic eating plan and intermittent</p>
<p>fasting implemented correctly long</p>
<p>enough for it to impinge and then that</p>
<p>way let&rsquo;s see what you really need</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really at the heart of it</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s under emphasized so much</p>
<p>especially in medicine they don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>talk about this basic eating plan so um</p>
<p>and this would explain too why certain</p>
<p>nutrition won&rsquo;t work if your if your</p>
<p>diet&rsquo;s not correct</p>
<p>um that being said as far as the</p>
<p>genetics which is another interesting</p>
<p>topic there are some people like even</p>
<p>myself</p>
<p>um I do not absorb choline that well so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always going to be deficient in</p>
<p>choline unless I take a good amount of</p>
<p>it so that&rsquo;s one supplement that I had</p>
<p>no clue that I needed until fairly</p>
<p>recently that I&rsquo;m taking now and um</p>
<p>because that can lead to all sorts of</p>
<p>cascaded issues with building you know</p>
<p>transmitters affecting sleep energy this</p>
<p>and that so uh stay tuned for a lot more</p>
<p>information on that because the problem</p>
<p>with genetics is like trying to</p>
<p>understand it so I&rsquo;m going to be</p>
<p>creating a lot of videos just on another</p>
<p>channel that just to simplify it so</p>
<p>you know you really can get it and don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to be</p>
<p>um falling asleep with all these</p>
<p>complexities and things that you</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t have to be exposed to well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great Kathy listen thank you so</p>
<p>much for that and folks don&rsquo;t you just</p>
<p>hate hearing from people that are having</p>
<p>success with a program of course you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t so let&rsquo;s go to another one Mary</p>
<p>from YouTube I can&rsquo;t thank you enough</p>
<p>for totally changing my life I got off</p>
<p>prednisone and cured my poly</p>
<p>maglia oops rheumatica good grief all</p>
<p>these uh ten dollar words I can&rsquo;t read</p>
<p>got rid of my Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a big one I lost 40 pounds in the</p>
<p>process I have more energy and I also</p>
<p>sleep better you&rsquo;re a lifesaver Dr Berg</p>
<p>just like Kathy mentioned her gallstones</p>
<p>are gone so yeah we do love that and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to continue to push that</p>
<p>every time you folks speak about it and</p>
<p>uh we&rsquo;re also going to continue to push</p>
<p>questions because you guys keep</p>
<p>answering them so let&rsquo;s look at the</p>
<p>first one for today and it asks the</p>
<p>audience what is the most blubbery he</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t say that fattiest organ in your</p>
<p>body I uh let&rsquo;s see and uh here&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>you said 75 percent say it&rsquo;s the brain</p>
<p>interesting uh 20 say the liver and five</p>
<p>percent say the breasts and Dr Berg</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t your skin and all that in Oregon</p>
<p>can I throw that in could that be you</p>
<p>fat yeah yeah that&rsquo;s an organ I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>throw that in so anyway who&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>hopefully me</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the brain</p>
<p>your brain is like 60 fat wow is it</p>
<p>interesting yeah so um you know here you</p>
<p>are concerned about uh fat well you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to be um having a lean brain</p>
<p>you want to have as much fat in your</p>
<p>brain as possible for for everything to</p>
<p>work because we it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s especially the</p>
<p>the type of fat that the brain needs is</p>
<p>which</p>
<p>DHA that&rsquo;s the omega-3 that&rsquo;s why the</p>
<p>fish oil is the cod liver oil is so</p>
<p>important</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and um so yeah that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>um your brain is a very fatty organ only</p>
<p>it only comprises of two percent of the</p>
<p>weight of your body but it Hogs 20 of</p>
<p>all the energy and the calories</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s an energy hog and um as far to</p>
<p>part of the survival so it gets the</p>
<p>Lion&rsquo;s Share of energy more than</p>
<p>anything else because we need the brain</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not an extra thing that we can you</p>
<p>know just slide by with so yeah</p>
<p>sometimes we need a brain sometimes we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t yeah so calling someone fat head</p>
<p>is not really a disparage in common</p>
<p>anymore you&rsquo;ll have to think of</p>
<p>something else that&rsquo;s right that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>compliment all right well uh we&rsquo;d like</p>
<p>to compliment everybody around the world</p>
<p>for watching this and let&rsquo;s find out</p>

<p>these United States and let&rsquo;s see he</p>
<p>also wanted to point out that the host</p>
<p>of World Cup Guitar World Cup so thank</p>
<p>you for that Terry and thank you for</p>
<p>your um just thankless job of typing all</p>
<p>this stuff out I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s much harder</p>
<p>to type it than it is for me to read it</p>
<p>so thank you everybody and as usual</p>
<p>stand by because some other people will</p>
<p>chime in afterwards being sad that they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t mentioned and we&rsquo;ll get to you</p>
<p>as well okay let&rsquo;s go to social media</p>
<p>and re retoo from YouTube the skin on my</p>
<p>joints started to Blacken during puberty</p>
<p>and it has been the same ever since I</p>
<p>have very dark elbows knees and Knuckles</p>
<p>any suggestions doc</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s usually a</p>
<p>a symptom of blood sugar issues insulin</p>
<p>resistance I&rsquo;m not saying you are</p>
<p>diabetic you might be I don&rsquo;t know but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s definitely One symptom as you</p>
<p>start getting</p>
<p>um darker</p>
<p>um pigmentation in certain places uh</p>
<p>folds of skin in your tissue I did a</p>
<p>video on this and there&rsquo;s other reasons</p>
<p>as well</p>
<p>um what if it&rsquo;s not that then what you</p>
<p>can do to change the color of that skin</p>
<p>if you want to try something as a the</p>
<p>vitamin C serum tends to work good on</p>
<p>Aging spots pigmentation sunspots and</p>
<p>also other</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know extra pigmentation in certain</p>
<p>parts of the body so you might want to</p>
<p>try that as a remedy</p>
<p>um but typically it&rsquo;s related to blood</p>
<p>sugar issues</p>
<p>very good okay here&rsquo;s an off-ask concern</p>
<p>Sunshine from YouTube I cannot fall</p>
<p>asleep easily my thoughts start going</p>
<p>here and there and my thinking gets</p>
<p>foggy uh at times what can I do to fix</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>simple simple I used to have this</p>
<p>problem too</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>this is a problem with your autonomic</p>
<p>nervous system you have kind of probably</p>
<p>your heavier amount of sympathetic or</p>
<p>flight of fight versus the</p>
<p>parasympathetic or the rest and digest</p>
<p>and could potentially be more cortisol I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know but the remedy is vitamin B1</p>
<p>you take B1 nutritional yeast</p>
<p>um and uh wow it should just turn off</p>
<p>the excessive</p>
<p>solving problems 24 7. that was me years</p>
<p>ago</p>
<p>but the ideal goal would be just to be</p>
<p>able to go to sleep and not have to</p>
<p>think while you&rsquo;re sleeping or trying to</p>
<p>go to sleep that&rsquo;s the goal but when</p>
<p>your body&rsquo;s in that fight or flight it</p>
<p>has to be</p>
<p>surviving by solving problems and um</p>
<p>unfortunately it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>start just increasing the B1 and find a</p>
<p>natural version of it and then watch</p>
<p>what happens it&rsquo;s just kind of like</p>
<p>calms right down it&rsquo;s a really good</p>
<p>thing to take before bed too okay very</p>
<p>good and that begs go ahead doc I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry</p>
<p>I was just going to say um</p>
<p>like now I&rsquo;ve gotten to the point where</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s not any thoughts going</p>
<p>through my my mind right before bed I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just going boom I&rsquo;ll wake up and then I</p>
<p>start thinking but uh not before bed</p>
<p>anymore so it does work encouraging okay</p>
<p>but anyway you mentioned nutritional</p>
<p>yeast so let&rsquo;s go with the next question</p>
<p>that relates to that there you have it</p>
<p>all right what what is the primary</p>
<p>reason</p>
<p>for bad side effects when taking</p>
<p>nutritional yeast it could also be</p>
<p>brewer&rsquo;s yeast as well</p>
<p>so some people when they take it they</p>
<p>boy they feel racing racing mine anxiety</p>
<p>mood problems they don&rsquo;t feel right and</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re like why is that well let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see if you guys know the answer</p>
<p>wow interesting well don&rsquo;t be hitting on</p>
<p>my nutritional yeast but it doesn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>that to me but anyway Patrick from</p>
<p>YouTube uh his wife my wife he says</p>
<p>experiencing blotches on her lower leg</p>
<p>that are very sensitive to the touch her</p>
<p>physician looked into her or and her</p>
<p>vitals are are all good excuse me do you</p>
<p>have any ideas doc blotchy legs</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re talking about a</p>
<p>neurological thing or was it when you</p>
<p>blotchy you&rsquo;re talking about was there</p>
<p>bruising or discoloration on the legs</p>
<p>well it says experiencing blotches so I</p>
<p>would think it was something visible</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>yeah so um I have videos on that um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s usually related to again the</p>
<p>blood sugar issued you see that in a lot</p>
<p>in diabetics because we&rsquo;re getting poor</p>
<p>circulation and then the circulation</p>
<p>shows up as um</p>
<p>a lack of blood flow to the capillaries</p>
<p>and so you see a lot of</p>
<p>like purple and um bluish</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>brownish Dots and a lot of circulation</p>
<p>issues in the in the extremities and</p>
<p>this also happens with the the</p>
<p>circulation that goes to the nerve too</p>
<p>this is why you end up with a peripheral</p>
<p>neuropathy which is a kind of a the</p>
<p>nerves start causing tingling burning</p>
<p>numbness in the bottom of the feet and</p>
<p>then the hands so um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so I mean it&rsquo;s such a an easy thing</p>
<p>to fix you just change the diet get the</p>
<p>sugar Out start doing intermittent</p>
<p>fasting and it that&rsquo;ll clear right up um</p>
<p>depending of course how much damage is</p>
<p>there but I&rsquo;ve seen it clear up very</p>
<p>nicely in fact even myself right</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I had pitting edema at one point in my</p>
<p>life I mean you press that&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>bit different but you press your finger</p>
<p>into the lower leg and it left it dead</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m like that is a major problem</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t have that anymore so um that</p>
<p>also can be corrected if you change the</p>
<p>diet but of course when they had the</p>
<p>pitting edema</p>
<p>the only thing green that I ate was</p>
<p>pistachio ice cream and lime green Jello</p>
<p>I never ate any vegetables or any any</p>
<p>good quality protein I was um I think</p>
<p>that was when I was a</p>
<p>vegetarian but I was really a</p>
<p>granitarian so</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>wow interesting well I certainly hope</p>
<p>that works because Patrick is</p>
<p>threatening to date his wife&rsquo;s sister</p>
<p>who is blotch free so I sure hope this</p>
<p>clear no I&rsquo;m just teasing Patrick I hope</p>
<p>that works out for you uh so let&rsquo;s move</p>
<p>on to the next one Stephen from YouTube</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m starving on keto what</p>
<p>else should I be doing</p>
<p>you you haven&rsquo;t adapted yet you haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>adapted to ketosis there&rsquo;s something not</p>
<p>right I would check your carb levels</p>
<p>your carb levels might be too high and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you may not be doing intermittent</p>
<p>fasting so you want to combine that</p>
<p>because there is going to be a</p>
<p>transition where you&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>hungry but we want to convert things to</p>
<p>fat burning and when you burn fat boom</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just your hunger goes away and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the biggest indication that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>working so</p>
<p>um I would re-watch the video compare</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing find out what it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>doing correctly but the hunger</p>
<p>is the thing to go away if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>it right lower carbs</p>
<p>um moderate protein and doing</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>cool okay so the uh frisky audience has</p>
<p>already answered question number two</p>
<p>which asks what is the primary reason</p>
<p>for bad side effects of taking</p>
<p>nutritional yeast and 65 of our</p>
<p>respondents say yeast overgrowth or</p>
<p>candida and 35 say a simply digestion</p>
<p>issues</p>
<p>so this is interesting because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating a yeast that&rsquo;s inactive it&rsquo;s dead</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to cause a yeast</p>
<p>infection in fact it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>impossible to cause a yeast infection</p>
<p>from eating nutritional yeast</p>
<p>um the more likely reason is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the added synthetic</p>
<p>B vitamins okay like here&rsquo;s an example</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>something and this is my own and it says</p>
<p>this is</p>
<p>non-fortified okay but most nutritional</p>
<p>yeast is fortified or enriched with</p>
<p>synthetic vitamins okay B12 folic acid</p>
<p>maybe B6 right well what happens um a</p>
<p>great percent of the population like 30</p>
<p>percent at least have a problem with</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>inability</p>
<p>to take those synthetics and turn them</p>
<p>into the active form</p>
<p>and the term for that is like</p>
<p>methylation they can&rsquo;t they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>methylate very well so and you need</p>
<p>these vitamins to do that and so</p>
<p>if they are deficient</p>
<p>in foods like in these natural forms of</p>
<p>these vitamins which they usually are</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not converting too well</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re also taking the synthetics</p>
<p>either from a supplement which is like</p>
<p>pretty much all of them or nutritional</p>
<p>yeast which has the enrichment</p>
<p>boy they&rsquo;re going to not feel too well</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a genetic issue and a lot of</p>
<p>people have a problem with it</p>
<p>um I think in in Blacks it&rsquo;s only one to</p>
<p>two percent and whites and Hispanic it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>20 to 40 percent it&rsquo;s very high have</p>
<p>this problem but um if someone has side</p>
<p>effects then we want to</p>
<p>um make sure they never take</p>
<p>uh anything with enrichment okay</p>
<p>enriching or fortifying anything but you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to worry about of course with</p>
<p>mine because I don&rsquo;t enrich it but</p>
<p>sometimes you get even breweries yeast</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s enriched but a lot of times it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>non-fortified so as long as you do the</p>
<p>non-45 you&rsquo;re going to be fine you won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a reaction so that&rsquo;s just a side</p>
<p>note but an important one since so many</p>
<p>people have this problem and um there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>I did a video on it so you can watch</p>
<p>that very good well uh here&rsquo;s a young</p>
<p>lady in our green room that has a cool</p>
<p>name Anastasia</p>
<p>and uh she is up next and she just took</p>
<p>a big hit from her coffee so I think</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s probably all jazzed up and ready</p>
<p>to go there you go you&rsquo;re on with Dr</p>
<p>Berg for your one question if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mind</p>
<p>thank you yes I&rsquo;m so excited to be here</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually brand brand new to</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and keto not brand</p>
<p>new to eating uh non-conventional</p>
<p>food but um</p>
<p>is I have an 18 mile nursing and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to conceive I also have um an</p>
<p>autoimmune issue the reason I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>intermittent fasting in keto is to keep</p>
<p>the inflammation down but I&rsquo;m wondering</p>
<p>if I have to use intermittent fasting</p>
<p>and the keto diet differently during</p>
<p>different phases of my menstrual cycle</p>
<p>to support the different hormones that</p>
<p>are uh</p>
<p>um yeah so are you you&rsquo;re um you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to conceive right now right</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not pregnant yet I am yes</p>
<p>okay well on a positive note not yet</p>
<p>okay when in a positive note when you do</p>
<p>become pregnant</p>
<p>um autoimmune diseases tend to turn off</p>
<p>which is cool they turn off so all of a</p>
<p>sudden I don&rsquo;t have this thing anymore</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s great so as long as you stay</p>
<p>pregnant you&rsquo;re fine so you can just</p>
<p>keep having kids for the next I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how many years but</p>
<p>um in the meantime the B vitamins</p>
<p>um you know what I&rsquo;m gonna just get</p>
<p>something here okay so doc had a little</p>
<p>technical issue but uh not a problem</p>
<p>because I had a backup battery I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>going to just put this in there that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great in the meantime Anastasia we need</p>
<p>you to carry the show so maybe a little</p>
<p>soft shoe dancing something intermittent</p>
<p>little music we&rsquo;ll see what um we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>talk about your babies if that goes on</p>
<p>though yeah okay and you have a baby</p>
<p>though right you already have an 18</p>
<p>month right</p>
<p>she makes my life very fun isn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>wonderful well uh we have the good</p>
<p>doctor back uh okay there we go oops</p>
<p>wait a minute let me just uh yeah let me</p>
<p>just fix it okay</p>
<p>this is on camera triage and uh I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re good there we go</p>
<p>I always come with a backup battery</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>the first thing is any autoimmune</p>
<p>disease you need to be taking a good</p>
<p>amount of vitamin D3 and I would take a</p>
<p>maintenance dose at least 10 000 I use</p>
<p>on a regular basis that&rsquo;ll keep the</p>
<p>inflammation down and you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>change that anytime during your cycle</p>
<p>um I would definitely during pregnancy</p>
<p>and before this is the most important</p>
<p>most important time</p>
<p>to um eat healthy to have this baby</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be a super baby so that</p>
<p>means like a combination of I would do</p>
<p>two meals a day intermittent fasting and</p>
<p>I would do the healthy version of the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet and I would definitely</p>
<p>take the key nutrients which is zinc</p>
<p>vitamin D of course all the B vitamins</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>um and cod liver oil because it&rsquo;ll give</p>
<p>you the omega-3 that you need and all</p>
<p>this is very important for fertility and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also important for once you become</p>
<p>pregnant is give the baby everything</p>
<p>that needs unfortunately so many um</p>
<p>mothers are taking</p>
<p>um prenatals that are synthetic I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t recommend that</p>
<p>um get get something that&rsquo;s food based</p>
<p>and then um maybe when you&rsquo;re pregnant</p>
<p>um don&rsquo;t do too much intermittent</p>
<p>fasting but don&rsquo;t snack so have like</p>
<p>three good meals with enough calories so</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to snack and that way the</p>
<p>child would be less susceptible to</p>
<p>having insulin resistance and blood</p>
<p>sugar issues but so many mothers too</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t stop the the junk food while</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pregnant and then that just</p>
<p>creates a whole bunch of issues now once</p>
<p>you be deliver</p>
<p>um this is when</p>
<p>the immune system for that child really</p>
<p>starts and um</p>
<p>I mean even in the womb I mean they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done studies on this and found it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a sterile environment that um</p>
<p>that fetus is basically have has</p>
<p>microbes and the amniotic fluid and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the placenta placenta so all these</p>
<p>microbes are are inoculating and</p>
<p>starting the uh the digestion system and</p>
<p>as well as the immune system so</p>
<p>hopefully you will breastfeed for a good</p>
<p>period of time too because that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>you get the microbes and hopefully</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have a natural birth and not</p>
<p>C-section because</p>
<p>um now the child will have the best</p>
<p>immune system for future life and so</p>
<p>these are all things that you can you</p>
<p>can then prevent the child from needing</p>
<p>braces down the road and having</p>
<p>scoliosis and flat feet and all these</p>
<p>other issues just by these basic things</p>
<p>that are so simple so inexpensive but I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily alter it for your</p>
<p>menstrual cycle</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>is that did that answer it sort of</p>
<p>yeah I think so I</p>
<p>you know of course you get</p>
<p>the whole and you&rsquo;re doing your research</p>
<p>about whatever and so you know I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>definitely read in different places that</p>
<p>throughout the amendment</p>
<p>natural cycle estrogen and then</p>
<p>progesterone and then you know ovulation</p>
<p>to treat intermittent fasting and keto a</p>
<p>little bit differently during those</p>
<p>different phases and so</p>
<p>um I guess I just want to make sure that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the in the right space uh you</p>
<p>know and optimizing fertility that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>main goal right now so yes just wanted</p>
<p>to make sure there wasn&rsquo;t anything</p>
<p>different that I should be doing okay</p>
<p>two points I just want to bring up since</p>
<p>you brought that up is that</p>
<p>um these studies that you&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>reading about</p>
<p>um you know the type of the ketogenic</p>
<p>diet that they&rsquo;re doing is definitely</p>
<p>not the healthy version it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um because keto is just basically low</p>
<p>carb so who knows what diet they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really on and also if you&rsquo;re just doing</p>
<p>three meals or two meals with no snacks</p>
<p>um that is not in any way going to</p>
<p>reduce fertility in fact think about</p>
<p>even women that have insulin resistance</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>um what do they get they get polycystic</p>
<p>ovarian syndrome they come very</p>
<p>unfertile so there&rsquo;s a huge Factor</p>
<p>relationship to having insulin problems</p>
<p>and infertility so if you&rsquo;re just doing</p>
<p>cut out the snacking and do a little bit</p>
<p>of intermittent fasting now that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>best chance you have becoming fertile</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple other things too you</p>
<p>can take to increase the fertility a</p>
<p>good quality of vitamin E is also good</p>
<p>because we know vitamin E deficiencies</p>
<p>will cause infertility in animals and</p>
<p>humans but the other thing is which I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sure you&rsquo;re going to love is fish eggs</p>
<p>are a really good remedy for fertility</p>
<p>um poor thing like caviar right but</p>
<p>um you may not need that but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something you can yeah I don&rsquo;t mind</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>wow well that&rsquo;s great well listen best</p>
<p>of luck to you uh and show off your new</p>
<p>baby once you have the healthy keto baby</p>
<p>you know uh Dr Berg&rsquo;s always bragging</p>
<p>about his grandchild or grandchildren</p>
<p>and uh just white brussels sprouts and</p>
<p>all that right and just loves that kind</p>
<p>of thing is that right to Dr bird</p>
<p>yes yes it is correct and uh you know we</p>
<p>just we&rsquo;re starting a um this child Out</p>
<p>on Just without all the the tons of</p>
<p>candies and sugars and Ultra processed</p>
<p>foods that most kids are raised on which</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>so bad</p>
<p>um people people just say Well they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not they&rsquo;re not overweight I&rsquo;m like that</p>
<p>is not the reason why you should</p>
<p>um feed kids healthy foods but don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wait till they&rsquo;re 18 before you change</p>
<p>their diet I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>noticed this it&rsquo;s very difficult once</p>
<p>they become teenagers to try to change</p>
<p>their diet</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>ideally what I&rsquo;d like to do is just um</p>
<p>start over with some new kids and go you</p>
<p>know what they&rsquo;ve never even heard of</p>
<p>sugar until they&rsquo;re 18. that would have</p>
<p>been a lot easier that&rsquo;s right I shun</p>
<p>all of my children that have had any</p>
<p>sugar so that leaves none anyway uh</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see uh this is sad Isabella from</p>
<p>YouTube started keto which is not sad</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s created acne on her back and</p>
<p>chest what&rsquo;s going on with her</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just a there&rsquo;s something else</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s either the type of Keto you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing it&rsquo;s not the healthy version or</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re missing</p>
<p>nutritionally</p>
<p>um with acne</p>
<p>um usually acne goes away when you do</p>
<p>the healthy version of Keto but vitamin</p>
<p>A is one of the most important things</p>
<p>for to prevent acne if you ever think of</p>
<p>Accutane it&rsquo;s like a synthetic version</p>
<p>of vitamin A which you don&rsquo;t want to do</p>
<p>but the natural version</p>
<p>um is in egg yolks it&rsquo;s in liver</p>
<p>in butter it&rsquo;s in some Dairy cheeses and</p>
<p>things like that so vitamin A the</p>
<p>retinal form not the pre vitamin A from</p>
<p>vegetables but that would that would</p>
<p>greatly help</p>
<p>terrific next question sir this is a</p>
<p>true falser</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>true or false a sedentary lifestyle is</p>
<p>the fourth leading risk factor for</p>
<p>mortality</p>
<p>audience true or false on that one in</p>
<p>the meantime let&rsquo;s go back to our great</p>
<p>audience on social media uh let&rsquo;s see I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t even pronounce this but I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to try Maggie from YouTube My granuloma</p>
<p>annulera will not go away it&rsquo;s on my</p>
<p>back and legs doctors can&rsquo;t help me what</p>
<p>do I do did I say that right doc have</p>
<p>you heard of that</p>
<p>yeah I just love these questions because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a medical doctor I can&rsquo;t can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give you a medical treatment but I could</p>
<p>just suggest a couple things to research</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um anytime you have</p>
<p>any skin disorder whatsoever there&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>things to look at one is the gut</p>
<p>your gut lining there&rsquo;s obviously</p>
<p>probably some problems with that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some problems in your gut could be</p>
<p>related to your food</p>
<p>um the surface area of all of your in</p>
<p>the inside of your digestive intestines</p>
<p>if you were to stretch it out would be</p>
<p>the size of a tennis court so it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>huge surface area that constantly is</p>
<p>being exposed to Foods pollution</p>
<p>microbes this and that so I would go</p>
<p>back to the simple basics of uh watching</p>
<p>my basic videos and what to eat and</p>
<p>doing the healthy version of Keto okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one thing and then the other</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s really good for any skin</p>
<p>conditions would be fasting but period</p>
<p>with periodic prolonged fasting so you</p>
<p>have intermittent fasting and then</p>
<p>um maybe once a week or every two weeks</p>
<p>you do a three day fast boy your skin</p>
<p>will be so good after that if you could</p>
<p>do that</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to recommend</p>
<p>versus trying to take some Remedy or</p>
<p>some lotion that</p>
<p>you know the skin is really from the</p>
<p>inside out you have to focus on that</p>
<p>interesting okay Jamila from YouTube is</p>
<p>there such a thing as eating too much</p>
<p>broccoli I could eat it every day with</p>
<p>no issues are there any drawbacks from</p>
<p>eating too much broccoli</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so I don&rsquo;t think so I</p>
<p>think if you&rsquo;re feeling good with it I</p>
<p>would also make sure you have other</p>
<p>Foods other than broccoli but no I I</p>
<p>wish I could eat more broccoli that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one thing I can&rsquo;t eat because it tears</p>
<p>up my stomach but you&rsquo;re getting a lot</p>
<p>of sulforaphane which is a phytonutrient</p>
<p>to help prevent cancer it&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>most researched phytonutrients</p>
<p>so um and there&rsquo;s a lot of other things</p>
<p>in broccoli that can help you of course</p>
<p>um you know if you have some raw some</p>
<p>steamed that would be good a little bit</p>
<p>better than um you know overly cooked</p>
<p>but no the breakfast is fine having it</p>
<p>in good amounts especially if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>react to it yeah and especially if you</p>
<p>throw some Gorgonzola cheese sauce over</p>
<p>it oh so good that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>for Christmas with our filet uh Doc and</p>
<p>by the way yeah the the birds are so</p>
<p>gracious they send us this fantastic</p>
<p>keto uh meat each year and uh we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>in heaven with that and again it forces</p>
<p>compliance on keto if you have that</p>
<p>greater quality of meat you might as</p>
<p>well do the deal and we&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>it with some Gorgonzola cheese sauce on</p>
<p>the broccoli you know Steve speaking</p>
<p>about meat I have I haven&rsquo;t ever had</p>
<p>venison before instead until recently</p>
<p>and I actually I really I&rsquo;m impressed</p>
<p>with the deer meat and it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>so healthy and it&rsquo;s so good I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>really enjoying it I think I might have</p>
<p>it more on a regular basis and it&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m liking it now can we plug that</p>
<p>company is it the same company that uh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called go out and get your own deer</p>
<p>in the woods oh okay good for you all</p>
<p>right I get that that&rsquo;s uh no fresher</p>
<p>than that Odette from YouTube I have a</p>
<p>red swollen right foot and ankle please</p>
<p>help that doesn&rsquo;t give any more detail</p>
<p>well was there an injury yeah I mean it</p>
<p>was an injury believe it or not the um</p>
<p>people go for ice I don&rsquo;t recommend ice</p>
<p>because ice slows down the healing think</p>
<p>about the blood is coming in there then</p>
<p>you get rid of the healing response it</p>
<p>delays the injury uh the best thing to</p>
<p>do is to do infrared get one of those</p>
<p>infrared</p>
<p>um little pads you can put on the injury</p>
<p>that works a lot better but ice is not</p>
<p>not the best thing this is different</p>
<p>than probably what you&rsquo;ve heard but um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s um it makes sense when you think</p>
<p>about it because</p>
<p>um the only time I would use ice is if I</p>
<p>had severe pain</p>
<p>okay and then you maybe want to use to</p>
<p>get rid of the pain but other than that</p>
<p>it does not increase the healing very</p>
<p>interesting well oh Dad if you get a</p>
<p>chance why don&rsquo;t you give us a little</p>
<p>more detail in case we&rsquo;re off um</p>
<p>you know off what&rsquo;s really going on with</p>
<p>you and we wish you well on that uh</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see Sarah from YouTube can you</p>
<p>recommend a generic test that would</p>
<p>indicate if I am absorbing nutrients</p>
<p>efficiently or</p>
<p>how do you think about it well that&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really good that&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>good question I think um there are</p>
<p>some GI tests that you can do</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t know of the names that&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>for the gut</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know unfortunately some of the other</p>
<p>tests are involve a scope scoping you</p>
<p>and looking at the lining of the</p>
<p>intestine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty invasive Sometimes some</p>
<p>because they have to sometimes put you</p>
<p>out in Scopia which will give you a lot</p>
<p>of good data</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>whether this is inflammation or maybe</p>
<p>Celiac or damage to the lining</p>
<p>um but that being said</p>
<p>um there is</p>
<p>a video I did on I mean I think it was</p>
<p>gut permeability it was called a leaky</p>
<p>gut with a doctor from Hungary which did</p>
<p>have a test</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s something that you can measure</p>
<p>for leaky gut which is uh which kind of</p>
<p>indirectly will help you understand</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on with the lining of the</p>
<p>colon which could tell you a lot</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so search out that video</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the other thing</p>
<p>would be to get a DNA test because that</p>
<p>will pick up if you have</p>
<p>genetic weaknesses that are not allowing</p>
<p>you to absorb vitamin D vitamin A B12</p>
<p>folic acid and a lot of other nutrients</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another good test to figure</p>
<p>things out</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so yeah that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s my answer and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sticking to it Steve okay and here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>audience&rsquo;s answer to our true false or a</p>
<p>sedentary lifestyle is the fourth</p>
<p>leading risk factor for mortality uh and</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s their claim 65 percent say that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s absolutely true 35 percent say no</p>
<p>way it&rsquo;s false winners please</p>
<p>I was surprised it&rsquo;s actually true now</p>
<p>if you think about the word sedentary</p>
<p>which means sitting too much it comes</p>
<p>from the Latin word which means sit and</p>
<p>um that means you&rsquo;re not getting</p>
<p>physical activity right so</p>
<p>um when I started to do a deep dive into</p>
<p>that topic I was actually very very</p>
<p>surprised in the studies they&rsquo;ve done uh</p>
<p>just comparing people that get two and a</p>
<p>half hours of exercise or physical</p>
<p>activity per week versus people that</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>oh my goodness your risk for cancer goes</p>
<p>up cardiovascular disease deaths from</p>
<p>diabetes like all these things get</p>
<p>really bad just from not moving you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying well what&rsquo;s that how is that</p>
<p>possible because our bodies were</p>
<p>designed genetically to move with motion</p>
<p>so in our environment we don&rsquo;t move as</p>
<p>much as</p>
<p>um our ancestors moved and because there</p>
<p>are so many genes connected to motion</p>
<p>and exercise and physical work</p>
<p>that are related to</p>
<p>reducing inflammation helping blood</p>
<p>sugars helping your cognitive function</p>
<p>so when you stop moving as much</p>
<p>boy you start really turning on</p>
<p>inflammation all sorts of problems</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m going to do a video on this</p>
<p>um I think it&rsquo;s fascinating and</p>
<p>it just is going to convince someone</p>
<p>that regular consistent exercise is</p>
<p>going to really prevent a lot of a lot</p>
<p>of problems from your brain your blood</p>
<p>sugars</p>
<p>longevity</p>
<p>very important simply because now we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>activating genes that promote health</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re inhibiting the ones that cause</p>
<p>disease</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>if and here&rsquo;s just a survey question if</p>
<p>you can put this in the in the comment</p>
<p>section</p>
<p>um tell me how much physical activity or</p>
<p>exercise that you get</p>
<p>in the comments section right now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>curious you know you can</p>
<p>you know just kind of describe what you</p>
<p>do</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but so many people I think 30 of the</p>
<p>population doesn&rsquo;t really do much I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t do anything between the ages of I</p>
<p>think 29 and 41 or two I did not</p>
<p>exercise</p>
<p>very much and I had a lot of body</p>
<p>problems</p>
<p>of course I&rsquo;m 43 right now so I am much</p>
<p>better isn&rsquo;t that something a youthful</p>
<p>doctor for us we&rsquo;ve got a lot of years</p>
<p>left in him and next up is Raj he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coming to us from Raj Rod Chester excuse</p>
<p>me New York and Raj is right on the</p>
<p>money he put his camera back on go on</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re with Dr you&rsquo;re on with Dr Berg</p>
<p>for one quick question if you mind Raj</p>
<p>hi doctor uh so basically I&rsquo;m feeling</p>
<p>like a lot of thirsty actually uh for</p>
<p>the past two three months so I went to</p>
<p>hospital like they did all the great</p>
<p>work they checked the potassium calcium</p>
<p>and sodium everything is normal and the</p>
<p>tasted A1C also it&rsquo;s like 5.1 which is</p>
<p>normal</p>
<p>so they were saying it could be sucrose</p>
<p>or something uh autoimmune disease but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not clear so I&rsquo;m feeling more</p>
<p>thirsty throughout the day actually like</p>
<p>night time before sleeping right I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>drinking like four to five liters of</p>
<p>water continuously</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not sure what to do here</p>
<p>okay if you did the A1C and it came out</p>
<p>um normal then the other reason for</p>
<p>excessive thirst would be what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>hypercalcemia so you may want to get</p>
<p>your parathyroid tested or your calcium</p>
<p>levels tested</p>
<p>um because there could be a problem</p>
<p>somehow with that of course in the</p>
<p>meantime</p>
<p>um realize that the water that you drink</p>
<p>is retained with salts and you you also</p>
<p>may need a bit more salt to hold the</p>
<p>water in your body</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and to adjust the thirst so make sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking at least a level teaspoon</p>
<p>of sea salt in your diet every single</p>
<p>day within your food and things</p>
<p>um and of course I&rsquo;m assuming that you</p>
<p>are on keto and you&rsquo;re not consuming</p>
<p>you know the breads pasta cereal</p>
<p>crackers biscuits waffles pancakes rice</p>
<p>um things like that I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not consuming that because that could</p>
<p>create</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>a problem with your fluids um because it</p>
<p>tends when you what happens when you do</p>
<p>eat refined carbs or sugar you retain</p>
<p>a lot more uh water and that can also</p>
<p>cause imbalances with the sensors for</p>
<p>your your fluids and um also your um</p>
<p>thirst and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>as well as your urination do you have um</p>
<p>problems with urination do you urinate</p>
<p>frequently or not</p>
<p>oh yes I&rsquo;m doing frequently</p>
<p>yeah you know there&rsquo;s also another type</p>
<p>of diabetes insipidus that you should</p>
<p>check as well so I think you need a a</p>
<p>deeper test check the parathyroid check</p>
<p>your calcium and check for uh find a</p>
<p>doctor that can check with diabetes</p>
<p>insipidus and see if there&rsquo;s any problem</p>
<p>in that area and then watch my videos</p>
<p>on whatever they found to to get uh</p>
<p>maybe a natural solution</p>
<p>all right well please let us know about</p>
<p>that Roger kind of short on time so but</p>
<p>please do get back with us and let us</p>
<p>know how that goes and we wish you all</p>
<p>the best health in the coming new year</p>
<p>and stick with that great keto stuff or</p>
<p>whatever that is going to continue to</p>
<p>increase your health and let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s just go straight over to Eric</p>
<p>uh he&rsquo;s in Boston and he was just</p>
<p>stretching his arms so I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got carpal tunnel or something or</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve just kept him on hold for too long</p>
<p>go ahead with your one question for Dr</p>
<p>Berg please Eric</p>
<p>hi Dr Eric thank you for the opportunity</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m usually a healthy person with</p>
<p>perfect BMI but back in January I had a</p>
<p>panic attack because of uh major</p>
<p>Financial loss and suddenly some other</p>
<p>health problems uh appeared like I had</p>
<p>uh I had like gerd reflux shortness of</p>
<p>breath a lot of digestion issues a lot</p>
<p>of bloating constant dry coughing all</p>
<p>the time and of course anxiety</p>
<p>so you know it has been like almost like</p>
<p>10 11 months now I&rsquo;m doing much better</p>
<p>than it was before however uh</p>
<p>my GI doctor told me that I have IBS</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m using Duloxetine 20 milligrams</p>
<p>every day it&rsquo;s like anti-depression</p>
<p>medication and it&rsquo;s also helping my uh</p>
<p>bloating issues as well because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>recommended by uh my GI doctor so it</p>
<p>looks like uh I will have to be using</p>
<p>this medication forever this is what my</p>
<p>uh behavioral</p>
<p>behavioral uh</p>
<p>doctor told me</p>
<p>so I was wondering if there is any</p>
<p>replacement for this medication because</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to use this medication</p>
<p>because of side effect over long term</p>
<p>is there any special diet or lifestyle</p>
<p>change or any type of food any type of</p>
<p>system that can replace this medication</p>
<p>by the way I asked this this question to</p>
<p>my GI doctor and she told me that oh if</p>
<p>you find that kind of like replacement</p>
<p>just let me know so I&rsquo;m asking you</p>
<p>great</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it could be and it&rsquo;s very commonly</p>
<p>that you would have some of these</p>
<p>symptoms related</p>
<p>to the side effects of your medication</p>
<p>um I would check all the side effects</p>
<p>see if they correlate but as you were</p>
<p>talking you know I was just kind of in</p>
<p>my mind seeing if there&rsquo;s any Common</p>
<p>Thread between some of the symptoms and</p>
<p>there definitely is when you experience</p>
<p>losses</p>
<p>of any sort which that&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>worst stress</p>
<p>our bodies can experience which creates</p>
<p>such a shock to the system that you</p>
<p>become</p>
<p>depleted with some really key nutrients</p>
<p>the biggest one being vitamin B1 and it</p>
<p>just happens vitamin B1 is the antidote</p>
<p>to a panic attack</p>
<p>it calms the nerve it pulls you out of</p>
<p>the flight or fight you know fear</p>
<p>sensation and it&rsquo;s great for nightmares</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>um for worry which is kind of like um</p>
<p>anxiety and uh not having a solution to</p>
<p>a problem</p>
<p>and so B1 is what you need to take a lot</p>
<p>of I would find a natural one but then I</p>
<p>would also find</p>
<p>um probably nutritional use with more B1</p>
<p>would probably be the best thing you</p>
<p>could do right now and you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>feel calmer and so then you can work</p>
<p>with your doctor to kind of make the</p>
<p>adjustments and wean off that medication</p>
<p>um the other thing is that watch my</p>
<p>video my two videos on panic attack</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>your breathing is very very important to</p>
<p>actively slow down your breath in and</p>
<p>out especially when you&rsquo;re sleeping you</p>
<p>can actually change your autonomic</p>
<p>nervous system and pull yourself right</p>
<p>out of a panic attack just by</p>
<p>slow breathing which is interesting</p>
<p>um so B1 vitamin D is important as well</p>
<p>but B1 is the key one and the other</p>
<p>interesting thing about B1</p>
<p>is that if you&rsquo;re deficient</p>
<p>you are not going to be able to make</p>
<p>this hormone another hormone it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>neurotransmitter called acetylcholine</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s going to affect something</p>
<p>called the vagus nerve</p>
<p>which calms down the heart and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to affect your digestion big time</p>
<p>so just by not having a B1 can create</p>
<p>all sorts of problems with the valve on</p>
<p>your stomach</p>
<p>um creating</p>
<p>um increasing your risk for all sorts of</p>
<p>GI gastrointestinal problems even the</p>
<p>production of hydrochloric acid is going</p>
<p>to be off so I think B1 is going to be</p>
<p>your best friend coming in the near a</p>
<p>few months that&rsquo;s what I would recommend</p>
<p>and then watch my recent video that I</p>
<p>talked about that which is the</p>
<p>the consequence of having a B1</p>
<p>deficiency and how it relates to</p>
<p>digestion I don&rsquo;t even know the name of</p>
<p>that video that I recently did but I</p>
<p>released it from the last week it&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>digestion and it&rsquo;s quite massive and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll give you some data and then also</p>
<p>watch um other videos that I had on B1</p>
<p>so you have the full understanding but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really what you need right now</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great well listen Eric get back</p>
<p>with us and let me tell you something</p>
<p>Eric here is a remedy on screen now and</p>
<p>for the whole audience and that&rsquo;s Dr</p>
<p>Berg&rsquo;s uh wonderful app now available uh</p>
<p>on from the Apple store or Google Play</p>
<p>and these are organized not to say that</p>
<p>the doctor is disorganized but YouTube</p>
<p>apparently is a tough place to research</p>
<p>and find different stuff but not on this</p>
<p>app so you have the power of Health</p>
<p>right at your fingertips whether you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Android or uh iPhone so go get that</p>
<p>folks and uh you&rsquo;ll probably knock out</p>
<p>these questions 20 times faster there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a an audio part of</p>
<p>that so what&rsquo;s great is if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>driving you just click the audio on the</p>
<p>videos and just listen to me listen to</p>
<p>certain videos that you&rsquo;re interested in</p>
<p>that way it&rsquo;s kind of like a an audio</p>
<p>book I listen to a lot of</p>
<p>audiobooks when I&rsquo;m driving</p>
<p>um so um it&rsquo;s nice so I would recommend</p>
<p>that very good okay next question</p>
<p>another true false or doc</p>
<p>okay true or false gluten is the only</p>
<p>protein we don&rsquo;t digest completely</p>
<p>all right folks climb on that let us</p>
<p>know what you think uh let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>oh here we go uh coins and ghouls is the</p>
<p>handle that this person&rsquo;s going uh from</p>
<p>on YouTube do breath Ketone meters</p>
<p>actually work</p>
<p>I think they do work they give you some</p>
<p>data but here&rsquo;s the thing as soon as you</p>
<p>adapt to ketosis you&rsquo;re going to be more</p>
<p>efficient at Burning ketones and less</p>
<p>efficient at wasting well you just</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not you&rsquo;re not going to waste as</p>
<p>many ketones like that&rsquo;s why the urine</p>
<p>Ketone test or the breath test are good</p>
<p>in the beginning of Keto but when you</p>
<p>start burning it it might not show up in</p>
<p>your urine anymore because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>utilizing these ketones you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>wasting them</p>
<p>um so the best one is a blood test but a</p>
<p>urine test is you know it&rsquo;s a good good</p>
<p>indicator roughly especially in the</p>
<p>beginning but probably not when you get</p>
<p>fully adapted</p>
<p>okay very good let&rsquo;s go to uh Saint</p>
<p>Augustine who got roughed up from a</p>
<p>hurricane I think and we&rsquo;ve got uh Dana</p>
<p>on and Dana we&rsquo;re running a little on</p>
<p>time but we want to get you in here so</p>
<p>let us know quickly what your question</p>
<p>is for Dr Burke</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been dealing with</p>
<p>um a phlegm or mucus for over a year now</p>
<p>and I just can&rsquo;t figure out what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on I have been to an ENT they&rsquo;ve scoped</p>
<p>me I&rsquo;ve been to an allergist I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>allergic to any environmental allergens</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m currently working with my primary</p>
<p>doctor and he has me on some nasal</p>
<p>sprays</p>
<p>um an allergy pill for a couple weeks to</p>
<p>see if that might help but nothing seems</p>
<p>to be working and I&rsquo;m not sure what to</p>
<p>do I have watched your videos</p>
<p>um and I&rsquo;ve done a couple of the things</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just stuck on what to do what to</p>
<p>try is it originating from the back of</p>
<p>the throat somewhere or is it coming</p>
<p>from the post nasal it seems like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>post nasal uh because when I wake up in</p>
<p>the morning I&rsquo;m having to blow my nose</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having to clear my throat</p>
<p>but I also find that throughout the day</p>
<p>I have to clear my throat it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>like a frog like it changes my voice</p>
<p>and I have to almost like gag to to</p>
<p>clear this</p>
<p>have you ever had uh mono or</p>
<p>epstein-birs that you know of not that I</p>
<p>know of</p>
<p>okay have you ever had really bad sore</p>
<p>throats</p>
<p>I get sore throats but I I think maybe</p>
<p>just with a common cold</p>
<p>have you do you have a history of</p>
<p>um having tonsil issues</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve had I&rsquo;ve never had my tonsils</p>
<p>out so not that I know of yeah we have a</p>
<p>history of taking antibiotics</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken a lot of antibiotics</p>
<p>I mean I have two young kids so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>always sick</p>
<p>yeah what happens though um you know</p>
<p>when people become sick and they have</p>
<p>this uh immune it&rsquo;s really think about</p>
<p>it like this wow my immune system is</p>
<p>actually working</p>
<p>and people don&rsquo;t like to be sick so they</p>
<p>instantly take something right when you</p>
<p>take antibiotics and a lot of them you</p>
<p>kill off bacteria and unfortunately</p>
<p>you end up with more uh fungus and yeast</p>
<p>that can grow because the bacteria there</p>
<p>to keep the yeast in check and the</p>
<p>fungus in check and a lot of people have</p>
<p>this chronic um fungal infection in the</p>
<p>sinuses and then they get that treated</p>
<p>and then it just comes back with a</p>
<p>vengeance so I think a good approach</p>
<p>for you would be to watch all of my</p>
<p>videos on the sinus and the to find</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s several remedies that you can</p>
<p>use and one would be actually a diluted</p>
<p>juice of kimchi if you take some of that</p>
<p>and put up in the nostrils it tends to</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s even supplements there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>certain microbe that can help uh</p>
<p>reestablish the the microbes in your</p>
<p>sinuses</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s also the Halo um it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a salt therapy it&rsquo;s a device I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;d be good for you that runs at</p>
<p>night in your room it&rsquo;s dry salt it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not sea salt sodium chloride that seems</p>
<p>to really uh purify your sinuses it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like being at the beach and that&rsquo;s Salt</p>
<p>Air and it&rsquo;s really good for uh sinuses</p>
<p>and also inhibiting pathogens things</p>
<p>like that</p>
<p>um and then also I would get on</p>
<p>my basic healthy eating plan and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to reduce</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>mucus in general especially if you might</p>
<p>be doing too many carbs and then fasting</p>
<p>is going to help the immune system the</p>
<p>acupressure tool or technique will</p>
<p>probably help you</p>
<p>drain but you&rsquo;re going to have to deal</p>
<p>with what&rsquo;s going on deep inside and</p>
<p>unfortunately</p>
<p>the medication route always ends up</p>
<p>making it worse with time because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re not looking at what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening with this this microbiome</p>
<p>inside your sinuses they&rsquo;re kind of like</p>
<p>well let&rsquo;s use this they&rsquo;re stronger and</p>
<p>stronger and stronger and then now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>developing resistant microbes that you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t kill no matter what so you want to</p>
<p>go in the area of uh probiotics eating</p>
<p>more probiotics Probiotic foods um</p>
<p>reestablishing that in your sinus is</p>
<p>doing Natural Things</p>
<p>um like um I list a whole bunch of them</p>
<p>you can start doing that</p>
<p>um but I do understand where you&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>I mean you probably had a lot of</p>
<p>treatment so whatever you do try not to</p>
<p>get any more antibiotics if unless you</p>
<p>absolutely have to because that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to take you in the wrong direction okay</p>
<p>thank you you&rsquo;re welcome that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>doc you&rsquo;re so generous with all your</p>
<p>time with these people it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking to your niece there giving a</p>
<p>great counsel and thanks so much you</p>
<p>know I was I was the poster child for</p>
<p>antibiotics every year I mean I took it</p>
<p>and uh so I have a lot of experience</p>
<p>with um what not to do</p>
<p>um you know of course I was like oh my</p>
<p>gosh I&rsquo;m getting sick I have to I have</p>
<p>to just suppress the symptom I&rsquo;m getting</p>
<p>a fever I have to take this but um that</p>
<p>immune system boy that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like your friend and getting sick</p>
<p>is actually a training for your immune</p>
<p>system when you&rsquo;re younger especially</p>
<p>um you know let your body go through</p>
<p>this whole cycle and you become stronger</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t live too much in a</p>
<p>sterile environment that&rsquo;s just as bad</p>
<p>yeah well I I sure didn&rsquo;t when my kids</p>
<p>were I don&rsquo;t know two or three are going</p>
<p>to so they&rsquo;re preschool or Center four</p>
<p>or five whatever the age goes I was sick</p>
<p>for two years straight with each of</p>
<p>their new strains they come home from</p>
<p>that slobber all over me which I love</p>
<p>but then I got sick</p>
<p>helping you now become very very strong</p>
<p>to uh pathogens yeah I&rsquo;m pretty tough</p>
<p>right now uh okay let&rsquo;s go back to uh I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;ll probably be our last</p>
<p>question for to this week true false</p>
<p>gluten is the only protein we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>digest uh completely and our respondents</p>
<p>said uh sorry I it kind of jumped up on</p>
<p>my screen 55 say false 45 say true who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true now if you look this up you</p>
<p>will say oh no we can digest it and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s usually uh put out by various uh</p>
<p>sites that don&rsquo;t are not credible</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a really good researcher this</p>
<p>guy is the top guy in the field of um</p>
<p>gluten intolerant celiac disease</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Dr Fasano wrote a book on gluten</p>
<p>fascinating book I&rsquo;m reading I mean this</p>
<p>guy is it really put put Celiac on the</p>
<p>map</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s done massive research has</p>
<p>massive success very credible and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the one that said gluten does not fully</p>
<p>digest because our we don&rsquo;t we have not</p>
<p>developed the enzymes yet to fully break</p>
<p>it down so then we end up with this</p>
<p>incomplete breakdown and also it has the</p>
<p>ability to dilate or open up or make our</p>
<p>gut more permeable permeable whether</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re allergic or not</p>
<p>so when you&rsquo;re eating wheat you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>basically creating a a version of leaky</p>
<p>gut because of these proteins are not</p>
<p>digesting and</p>
<p>because some of the other chemical other</p>
<p>the the Cascade of things that can</p>
<p>happen and that leads to</p>
<p>um a lot of problems especially if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing it chronically</p>
<p>gluten is an interesting protein because</p>
<p>first of all over the last two decades</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just like we&rsquo;re increasing the</p>
<p>concentration of gluten in the wheat so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot more than it used to be and</p>
<p>um this is tearing up our colons and and</p>
<p>even</p>
<p>um because it&rsquo;s not digested it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>providing a lot of health benefits other</p>
<p>than that wonderful texture that bread</p>
<p>gives you that wonderful gooey</p>
<p>bread dough you know that we love so</p>
<p>much but oh my gosh it comes with a a</p>
<p>package I remember</p>
<p>um not thinking twice consuming</p>
<p>uh French bread a huge uh loaf of French</p>
<p>bread that&rsquo;s just like and just Downing</p>
<p>it just without even thinking it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a problem at all and I always wondered</p>
<p>why I shortly after was just doubled</p>
<p>over with this serious digestive issue</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>these the gluten or byproducts of gluten</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>our bodies interpret that</p>
<p>um like certain components of microbes</p>
<p>and so it does create an immune reaction</p>
<p>very commonly and so we have this uh</p>
<p>setting the person up for a potential</p>
<p>autoimmune disease because all these</p>
<p>autoimmune start in the gut and</p>
<p>something</p>
<p>had to have created a permeability issue</p>
<p>one really important thing with small</p>
<p>children or babies like if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>for you know between being born in four</p>
<p>months or five months do not give them</p>
<p>any grains at that age you&rsquo;re gonna set</p>
<p>them up for all sorts of problems their</p>
<p>immune system and their their microbiome</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t strong enough to</p>
<p>really deal with it so that&rsquo;s really the</p>
<p>problem is that we don&rsquo;t have the the</p>
<p>microbiome to deal with the enzymes that</p>
<p>are necessary to break down certain</p>
<p>things so creates a lot of issues by the</p>
<p>way can we put you on the spot just</p>
<p>before the show in uh this gentleman uh</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see wants to know when your last</p>
<p>cheat day was and what did you have this</p>
<p>is coming from ward he dares to ask you</p>
<p>what your last cheat day when I mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a holidays he probably suspects</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having some sugar cookies or</p>
<p>something</p>
<p>well here&rsquo;s the thing I don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>cheat day but</p>
<p>um I have gone off the program of course</p>
<p>so I was in uh I think I was in um Italy</p>
<p>and definitely had had to experiment</p>
<p>with um something called um Pizza</p>
<p>and so that was probably the last time</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>you know I I can afford to do that</p>
<p>occasionally I don&rsquo;t do it a lot but um</p>
<p>I do enjoy a high quality pizza and so</p>
<p>um yeah that was it that was it Ward</p>
<p>your suspicions were your suspicions</p>
<p>were correct but look he&rsquo;s still healthy</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s great anyway thanks for that</p>
<p>last little tidbit I guess we&rsquo;re out of</p>
<p>time doc so if you take us away</p>
<p>appreciate appreciate all your wonderful</p>
<p>comments and thank you for your</p>
<p>attention I really uh appreciate that</p>
<p>and uh stay tuned for some really</p>
<p>interesting videos coming up this next</p>
<p>week uh which are even I think are going</p>
<p>to be even more interesting the last</p>
<p>week have a wonderful weekend we will</p>
<p>see you next week same time same place</p>
