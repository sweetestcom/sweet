    <p>Hi friends, we&rsquo;re starting this episode off with a shot and y&rsquo;all know I hate</p>
<p>whiskey for the fucking life of me but I saw this thing about when you&rsquo;re sick</p>
<p>that like the old-time remedy is like to take a shot of whiskey so I bought some</p>
<p>whiskey I took a shot last night I don&rsquo;t know if it helped or not I felt good but</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna do a shot okay cuz I&rsquo;m sick like a fucking child over here I&rsquo;m all</p>
<p>like snotty and gross so let&rsquo;s start this episode off with a shot and then</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna get into talking about trauma that still fucks with you and I</p>
<p>talked to my mom about this before so I have an example with my life and what</p>
<p>happened to me recently I&rsquo;m gonna tell you my kind of story about how I kind of</p>
<p>got I don&rsquo;t like the word triggered but I got triggered from what happened in</p>
<p>Berlin like I thought getting jumped in Berlin didn&rsquo;t really fuck with me but I</p>
<p>had a situation happen similar that kicked my body into fight-or-flight mode</p>
<p>and I was ready to fucking go again with a group of like five dudes I&rsquo;m gonna tell</p>
<p>you how I got through all that how I handled it whatever and then I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>tell you a situation that happened with my mom recently I literally had a full</p>
<p>call conversation with her before this because I wanted to make sure one she</p>
<p>was okay with me talking about it and two I wanted her to teach me how she got</p>
<p>herself through it so I could give you two perspectives about how to deal with</p>
<p>anxiety attacks your body getting triggered your mind getting triggered</p>
<p>like panic attacks anxiety attacks all that so let&rsquo;s take this fucking shot</p>
<p>okay oh my god I hate this shit</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t the worst thing in the world it wasn&rsquo;t good it wasn&rsquo;t tequila okay</p>
<p>you better fucking heal me and save me now get out of camera we&rsquo;re not doing a</p>
<p>free fucking promo I don&rsquo;t know what whiskey to buy I just bought that cuz it</p>
<p>looks cute like with the drip on it I just thought it was cute you know so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s start off with what happened to me so I made a video about when I got</p>
<p>jumped in Berlin it&rsquo;s a couple of podcast episodes ago if you haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>watched it go watch it if you&rsquo;re not watching this episode on YouTube why</p>
<p>bitch I have this podcast on Spotify and Apple podcasts also so you can have</p>
<p>audio versions or you can have like visual versions but I invested a lot of</p>
<p>money into this fucking equipment so watch the video version but basically</p>
<p>what happened in Berlin was me and my friend got jumped by like five guys and</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think it bothered me I truly did it like I&rsquo;ve been through shit like</p>
<p>that before I&rsquo;ve been through worse than that like physical attacks and fights and</p>
<p>shit like I grew up fighting I grew up with a lot of shit grew up getting</p>
<p>bullied really bad but I truly didn&rsquo;t think what happened in Berlin with</p>
<p>getting jumped fucked with me that bad but it was a traumatic situation and I</p>
<p>just thought I was like above it all you know so I didn&rsquo;t realize how bad it</p>
<p>fucked with me until I was in Pensacola visiting my family and I went out so I</p>
<p>just came back from Florida that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m sick I&rsquo;m fucking dying I went and</p>
<p>visited my family for the holidays but when I was there I went out downtown</p>
<p>where I used to go out in Pensacola and the situation that happened was I saw a</p>
<p>lot of old people I used to see I saw a lot of my old friends all the people I</p>
<p>used to party with and this girl came up to me and hugged me she was so excited</p>
<p>she ran up and hugged me and we like chatted for a second and then her</p>
<p>fucking straighty tough stuff ass boyfriend came over to me and tried to</p>
<p>do that shit where I like trying a big dick you like come up and shake your</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s your name like he&rsquo;s a fucking hick so he does that straight boy</p>
<p>intimidated shit I play that game very well my straight boy act goes on very</p>
<p>fast and I will intimidate you right the fuck back I don&rsquo;t back down no matter</p>
<p>how big strong scary tough I don&rsquo;t give a fuck that you play with horses for a</p>
<p>living you hick shit oh my god cool it but this dude comes over being like mad</p>
<p>aggressive so I match it like bitch you&rsquo;re not gonna play with me like that</p>
<p>so I kind of like shut the situation down I was like alright let me just get</p>
<p>the fuck away from this before it becomes a problem because he didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I was gay you cannot tell that I&rsquo;m fucking a faggot by looking at me you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t fucking tell so especially when I&rsquo;m out like I put on my tough exterior</p>
<p>of like let&rsquo;s not have no fucking problems but the more you get to know me</p>
<p>the more I like sis it up with you you know but when I&rsquo;m first meeting people I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t play that and especially seeing Hicks and people who when I mean by Hick</p>
<p>is like a redneck like a country motherfucker like they&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>closed-minded they don&rsquo;t typically like gay people so I try to like prevent that</p>
<p>from even being a topic of discussion like I&rsquo;m very chameleon with my</p>
<p>sexuality I&rsquo;ll let you know if I want to let you know or I hide it and keep it to</p>
<p>my fucking self he didn&rsquo;t know I was gay so he tries me with that shit I got</p>
<p>fucking annoyed so I was like alright I&rsquo;m going outside to have a cigarette</p>
<p>and I was with my best friend Genevieve so me and her go outside to have a</p>
<p>cigarette we&rsquo;re standing out there minding our fucking business and all of</p>
<p>a sudden the girl that saw me came running outside to me like after a few</p>
<p>minutes like came to talk to me and was like oh my god hey I&rsquo;m so sorry he acted</p>
<p>like that he doesn&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;re gay and he was like just doing the</p>
<p>typical like protective shit and I was like no I get it I fully respect it I</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t fucking like him now it is what it is you made a bad first</p>
<p>impression I don&rsquo;t give a fuck what the situation was I understand being</p>
<p>protective but you were an aggressive little shit about it there&rsquo;s a way to do</p>
<p>it calmly that I execute and he just didn&rsquo;t do it right and it pissed me the</p>
<p>fuck off so like I get it it is what it is the situation happened whatever then</p>
<p>he comes outside after her apparently she yelled at him and cuts his fucking</p>
<p>ass out and taught him to behave and told him to like be nice because Leo&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gay he&rsquo;s not a fucking threat you dumb shit but this dude is like almost my</p>
<p>height so they love to get pissy when I&rsquo;m fucking taller than them and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>cuter than them and their bitch wants to hug on me but anyway he comes walking</p>
<p>out to me and he comes at me with some shit again he comes at me with a</p>
<p>fucking attitude and when he comes walking out the door toward me he comes</p>
<p>to me he&rsquo;s like hey I want to talk to you and I said oh what the fuck do you</p>
<p>want now I&rsquo;m standing there with my cigarette I&rsquo;m like what the fuck do you</p>
<p>want now and I just look at him and he comes up and he tries to be mr. fucking</p>
<p>nice guy oh I just wanted to apologize and say I&rsquo;m sorry like she told me you</p>
<p>were gay I don&rsquo;t want to say names and she was like she told me you were gay</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m John I just want to come apologize like I made myself look like a</p>
<p>dick he like owned up to the situation and was fine but he was playing like</p>
<p>this passive-aggressive shit behind it like he was trying to be cool but also</p>
<p>being passive-aggressive still trying to be tough stuff and intimidate me you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not gonna do it fucker and then he went to hug me and I was like uh-uh I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>shake your hand but I&rsquo;m not hugging you and he apparently didn&rsquo;t like that so he</p>
<p>just like played it off and then he&rsquo;s like the conversation died down whatever</p>
<p>and then he said some shit and was like and don&rsquo;t try me like that again boy and</p>
<p>I said try you like what and his girlfriend like the girl that I knew was</p>
<p>like ah shit here we go cuz the bitch knows how I am like try you with what</p>
<p>bitch try you with what don&rsquo;t call me fucking boy and don&rsquo;t come at me with</p>
<p>no fucking attitude like that I don&rsquo;t know who the fuck you think you are and</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care who the fuck you are like he plays that little passive shit and</p>
<p>then I would match it just stronger and then he&rsquo;d slip back and he was like oh</p>
<p>no like rejecting my hug like I just want to hug you I want you to know that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re friends now and I was like okay fine and at this point I&rsquo;m just like</p>
<p>frustrated I&rsquo;m annoyed with this motherfucker I just want him to get away</p>
<p>from me like just go I don&rsquo;t care that you made yourself look a dick I have no</p>
<p>interest in hearing you out get the fuck away from me like you&rsquo;re ruining my</p>
<p>night you&rsquo;re ruining my time this is the first bar we went to the first bar the</p>
<p>start of the night is a fucking problem can I just have a cigarette in peace you</p>
<p>know can you just leave me the motherfucker alone so I&rsquo;m standing there</p>
<p>talking to Genevieve and then someone that recognized me from tik-tok comes up</p>
<p>to me this guy he was like really sweet he was a country guy too and he was</p>
<p>basically like come up to talk to me about how what I&rsquo;ve posted online about</p>
<p>being gay has like opened his perspective and he had an uncle that was</p>
<p>gay and it&rsquo;s helped him understand him more and the whole family shunned him</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve like helped him whatever it was super sweet it was super nice love</p>
<p>talking to him but he&rsquo;s standing here to my right Genevieve is to my left and</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re at is like a circular seating thing so like if you&rsquo;re at the</p>
<p>front there&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like a u-shape and I&rsquo;m kind of like at this back corner</p>
<p>Genevieve&rsquo;s right here and the guy that I know is right here and then the girl</p>
<p>that I know is kind of like near him talking to her fucking boyfriend and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a giant seating thing in the middle so there is no quick exit out</p>
<p>of this and I don&rsquo;t fucking like that I&rsquo;m very paranoid I&rsquo;m very scared</p>
<p>everything so I&rsquo;m already a little like all right whatever but I do have</p>
<p>Genevieve I have this guy that recognizes me we&rsquo;re all friendly we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all fine and then homeboy had his brother come outside and introduce</p>
<p>himself to me he walks straight up to me and tries to do that fucking shit</p>
<p>that straight men do where they try and shake your hand too strong I&rsquo;ll break</p>
<p>your fucking hand and shove it up your ass do not do that to me because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna shake your shit back worse and you&rsquo;re gonna look like a fucking rattled</p>
<p>little dog I don&rsquo;t like that oh my god it literally pisses me the fuck off but</p>
<p>homeboys brother comes out and he does that shit and I just fucking look at him</p>
<p>in his face and then his friend comes out introduces me and now all these</p>
<p>people are standing around me and my body remembered what happened in Berlin</p>
<p>and I fucking freaked out like internally I started having like really</p>
<p>bad anxiety I started kicking in like all my like fear all my paranoia</p>
<p>assessing the situation I&rsquo;m trapped in this corner</p>
<p>Genevieve&rsquo;s next to me it&rsquo;s a girl and there&rsquo;s these fucking men around and I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t see like the guy that followed me and like recognized me as someone on my</p>
<p>side I didn&rsquo;t fucking know so I just saw a bunch of men around me and I was in a</p>
<p>corner and we already had that like underlying like aggressive shit going on</p>
<p>so my body freaked out my body remembered what happened to me in Berlin</p>
<p>with like a bunch of men around and all of a sudden there&rsquo;s a giant fight and</p>
<p>you get kicked in the fucking face so I kick into fight-or-flight mode and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>literally like standing there trying to smoke this fucking cigarette like I</p>
<p>pulled out another one because this interaction lasted too long so I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>trying to like smoke my cigarette and I realized how bad I&rsquo;m shaking so I just</p>
<p>held my hands down and I was just standing there and like I already saw</p>
<p>the situation for what it was my body went into full fight-or-flight mode my</p>
<p>mind was still logical but quickly after my body started freaking out my mind</p>
<p>started freaking out and it sent me into a fucking like panic attack kind of but</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t like a panic attack where it cripples you it was like a panic attack</p>
<p>of like let&rsquo;s get this shit over with I literally was thinking in my head can</p>
<p>someone just do something so we can fight already just standing there</p>
<p>anticipating it was fucking with me so bad I was about to just swing on my own</p>
<p>to just start this fucking shit show and get it over with I just didn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>deal with it I didn&rsquo;t like the anticipation I saw the situation for</p>
<p>what it was my mind convinced me we&rsquo;re getting jumped again so I was like let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just do it then let&rsquo;s get it over with let me just fucking swing let&rsquo;s just get</p>
<p>this party started bitch because standing there and anticipating it and</p>
<p>having my body ready and just being so anxious I was like I just want it to be</p>
<p>over let&rsquo;s just fight but I look over at Genevieve and she&rsquo;s like talking to</p>
<p>somebody else like in the corner and I looked at her and I was like I want to</p>
<p>get the fuck out of here and she saw it in my face and she was like okay do you</p>
<p>want to go inside and I was like yes so she grabs me and we walked inside and I</p>
<p>kind of like cooled off for a second and I just had to like walk myself</p>
<p>through everything and I had to calm myself down but I didn&rsquo;t want to like</p>
<p>give away that I was like as triggered I hate to say that but like my body was so</p>
<p>triggered and I was trying not to give away how like antsy and like anxious I</p>
<p>was to everyone else around me I didn&rsquo;t want to ruin their night but Genevieve</p>
<p>saw me like shaking and saw me like ready and she was like alright let&rsquo;s get</p>
<p>the fuck out of here so we went inside found my sister and I just like chilled</p>
<p>for a second I went off to the corner by myself with my people and we fucking</p>
<p>just stood there for a second and then my other friends that I recognized</p>
<p>walked in and I was like okay but I want to run you through what I was telling</p>
<p>myself in my mind to calm myself down because a lot of you guys ask me how I</p>
<p>deal with anxiety attacks or like panic attacks or shit or like you have a</p>
<p>traumatic event happen and it fucks with you again I was basically telling myself</p>
<p>like I assessed the situation for what it was I was aware my body was reacting</p>
<p>the reason I didn&rsquo;t just swing is because I asked myself is there an</p>
<p>actual threat right now is anyone acting aggressive is anyone doing anything that</p>
<p>you think is gonna lead to a fight and attack anything are you okay in this</p>
<p>moment and I said yes is there a threat no that I could know I&rsquo;m like aware of I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel like there&rsquo;s an actual threat but I was trying to like talk myself</p>
<p>through my emotions and I was like okay once I saw there was no threat I talked</p>
<p>to Genevieve and I was like I want to get the fuck out of here because it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter if there&rsquo;s no threat or not if you&rsquo;re triggered like that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not thinking rationally it would have taken one crooked look from one of them</p>
<p>and I would have just went to town you can&rsquo;t let yourself just stay in a</p>
<p>situation where you&rsquo;re fucked up like that you need to get away from it you</p>
<p>need to get out of it so like yes there was no threat but did I want to get the</p>
<p>fuck away yes so I told Genevieve and we got the fuck out of there and I went</p>
<p>inside but when I was trying to calm myself down I was just like okay Leo</p>
<p>what happened in Berlin fucked with you more than you thought but we&rsquo;re not in</p>
<p>Berlin you&rsquo;re not getting attacked you&rsquo;re okay you&rsquo;re safe you&rsquo;re with your</p>
<p>people around you just take a minute breathe go have a cigarette out the</p>
<p>other door which I did I went outside and just fucking chilled for a second</p>
<p>with Genevieve and I was like just cooling it and I just had to like bring</p>
<p>my emotions back and I had to like breathe I had to focus on breathing</p>
<p>because you want to bring your heart rate down when you&rsquo;re having an anxiety</p>
<p>attack or when you&rsquo;re in fight-or-flight mode touch your neck that calms your</p>
<p>central nervous system if you touch your mouth with something like a cigarette or</p>
<p>like you can literally just bite your nails or whatever it is it&rsquo;s a pacifying</p>
<p>behavior that will calm your nervous system touch your neck hug someone like</p>
<p>I literally grabbed Genevieve&rsquo;s hand because skin-to-skin contact with</p>
<p>another human being calms your nervous system and releases endorphins so these</p>
<p>are a couple of things that I was doing to calm myself down but I had to</p>
<p>reassure myself there was no threat if I wanted to get the fuck out of there</p>
<p>because I was uncomfortable that&rsquo;s fine I don&rsquo;t care about ruining everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>night I don&rsquo;t give a fuck what y&rsquo;all want to do if y&rsquo;all want to do it stay</p>
<p>here I&rsquo;m gonna go somewhere else like you need to prioritize yourself and take</p>
<p>care of yourself when you are in that emotional state because it&rsquo;s not a fun</p>
<p>one to be in it&rsquo;s very hard so don&rsquo;t worry about considering other people</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not okay consider yourself but don&rsquo;t be that friend that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>fucking obnoxious and annoying that every time you do something you have a</p>
<p>fucking panic attack get it together bitch hold your shit in and like hold it</p>
<p>together okay like you don&rsquo;t want to be that friend that&rsquo;s just always got a</p>
<p>motherfucking problem you know like I&rsquo;m never that friend I can handle fucking</p>
<p>anything but when I&rsquo;m having like an issue like that like Genevieve saw it</p>
<p>and like was like all right let&rsquo;s get the fuck out of here but the thing I</p>
<p>want to explain with leaning on someone you&rsquo;re with is people know what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like to be upset every single human being has been upset they&rsquo;ve wanted</p>
<p>comfort and haven&rsquo;t had it so if you give someone the chance to be comfort</p>
<p>for you they will appreciate it and they will love it don&rsquo;t feel bad about</p>
<p>voicing something to your friends about something that fucks with you and</p>
<p>bothers you like if Genevieve started having a panic attack I would want to be</p>
<p>there for her I would want to take control of a situation and get her out</p>
<p>of wherever we&rsquo;re at I would like to take that pressure on because I know how</p>
<p>it feels to need it basically people want to be there for you and I promise</p>
<p>they do just open up about what you&rsquo;re experiencing use your words as best as</p>
<p>you can if you can&rsquo;t speak really because I know that like anxiety attacks</p>
<p>are very very harsh and you can&rsquo;t like get words out sometimes so if you can</p>
<p>talk or communicate to a friend do it but another thing I suggest with going</p>
<p>out or like being around people if you have someone you&rsquo;re close to warn them</p>
<p>and let them know and be like hey if this happens let&rsquo;s set up some kind of</p>
<p>code word or a situation like something I can do to like touch your elbow or if</p>
<p>I do this certain movement or I say this certain thing it means get me the</p>
<p>fuck out of wherever we&rsquo;re at so that you guys have something set up when you</p>
<p>go into a situation because the next night we went out again and we were on</p>
<p>the way out I told all my friends I told my sister I told everybody I was like</p>
<p>look if I say I&rsquo;m gonna go have a cigarette that means I&rsquo;m gonna go have a</p>
<p>cigarette I&rsquo;m fine I just want to go fuck with smoke if I say I&rsquo;m gonna go</p>
<p>take ten that means I&rsquo;m overstimulated and something&rsquo;s wrong so I&rsquo;m gonna go</p>
<p>outside and so they know how to differentiate when I&rsquo;m walking away</p>
<p>because something&rsquo;s wrong or I&rsquo;m walking away to go have a cigarette you know you</p>
<p>need to set that up with your people you need to do it and you need to bring</p>
<p>people in on it because forcing yourself to just sit there and deal with the</p>
<p>anxiety attack by yourself makes it ten times harder trying to be dealing with</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re feeling trying to calm yourself down and then also be aware and</p>
<p>considerate of like how you&rsquo;re looking on the outside and who you&rsquo;re impacting</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too much to take into consideration when you&rsquo;re not in a logical mindset so</p>
<p>do things to take that pressure off of yourself and those are just a couple of</p>
<p>things that I like to do and all of my friends know whenever one of us is</p>
<p>freaking or bugging the fuck out you tell me I&rsquo;ve got you I&rsquo;m getting us out</p>
<p>of wherever we are I will take the lead and get us out and I had a big</p>
<p>realization around this when I was at a festival a few months ago and I was</p>
<p>tripping on shrooms I just love to look around when I&rsquo;m on shrooms like I just</p>
<p>love to look around because like realizations just hit me in the fucking</p>
<p>head so this girl was standing up and like she was too far away from me to get</p>
<p>to her but it&rsquo;s like basically when you&rsquo;re waiting on a set to happen</p>
<p>everybody sits down where you are so it&rsquo;s like a giant sea of people and this</p>
<p>one girl was standing up like looking around and I could tell she was like</p>
<p>panicking and she was trying to look around and couldn&rsquo;t find places to step</p>
<p>to get out of the giant field of people she was just trying to like get out of</p>
<p>it but I had the realization when you are panicked when you are upset when you</p>
<p>are anxious if I would have just walked up to her or somebody would have walked</p>
<p>up to her grabbed her hand and said I got you and started walking even if I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know where I was going if I just grabbed her hand that relieves her of so</p>
<p>much stress and pressure because for you to be freaking out emotionally like that</p>
<p>and then still be trying to find a way out to go like get by yourself for a</p>
<p>second to cool yourself off if you just can hand that pressure off to someone</p>
<p>else it doesn&rsquo;t matter if I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;m going just the fact that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re holding my hand and I feel like someone is there to help me will relieve</p>
<p>so much of your anxiety trust me because as soon as Genevieve grabbed my hand and</p>
<p>got me the fuck out of there I could have got out of there on my own but just</p>
<p>having her there meant so much and it helped so much so that was kind of the</p>
<p>realization with my shrooms thing about an anxiety attack but with this girl</p>
<p>even if the girl was like walking her pace out of the people and someone</p>
<p>grabbed her hand in like they were still walking the same pace it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>how quick you get out of it it just matters if you feel like you have</p>
<p>support and someone with you to do it so it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re going the</p>
<p>same pace it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re helpful or not but just having someone</p>
<p>there with you and getting to let go of some of that pressure of trying to</p>
<p>figure out how to get out of where you are will help so fucking much trust me</p>
<p>just imagine it just literally fucking imagine it you&rsquo;re having an anxiety</p>
<p>attack you&rsquo;re freaking out I see it you told me you want to get the fuck out of</p>
<p>there I grab your hand if we&rsquo;re in the middle of a club and I get you out of</p>
<p>the club just having me guide you just allows you to cool down and like it</p>
<p>gives you relieves you of so much so if you can set that up with someone your</p>
<p>friends with or close to or someone you&rsquo;re with do it even if you meet a</p>
<p>fucking stranger at a party if they seem in tune if they seem with it if you meet</p>
<p>someone like me good luck reading it I don&rsquo;t fucking know how to tell like I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know how to tell like you could just feel people&rsquo;s energy but if someone</p>
<p>came up to me at a pregame and was like hey I just want to let you know like I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to be the weird one of the group but I get really bad anxiety</p>
<p>attacks so like if I have something happen do you mind if I come to you and</p>
<p>I would say abso-fucking-lutely like I would set up a code word I would set up</p>
<p>a like a thing that we could do for her to communicate it like verbally and then</p>
<p>like a touch signal I&rsquo;ve like get me the fuck out of here and then I would do</p>
<p>it because I know what it&rsquo;s like to need that so don&rsquo;t be scared to talk to a</p>
<p>stranger talk to your friends talk to anyone everyone knows what it&rsquo;s like to</p>
<p>need comfort everyone knows what it&rsquo;s like to have anxiety so they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>want to be there for you just trust me give people the chance to be that</p>
<p>comfort for you and you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll be shocked you&rsquo;ll genuinely be shocked oh</p>
<p>one thing else I want to talk about is my thumb I know it looks fucked up and</p>
<p>dirty and gross I&rsquo;m sick over here so I was trying to make a salad earlier and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like cutting up my lettuce and I sliced my fucking thumb oopsie but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just trying to eat healthy take care of myself cuz I&rsquo;m fucking dying of I&rsquo;m sick</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m trying to like fucking eat good and I slice my thumb open but I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>putting no band-aid I&rsquo;m just gonna let it bleed you literally I want to cut it</p>
<p>off like just do your fucking thing and leave me alone like why am I like this</p>
<p>when I get injured but anyway let&rsquo;s move into what happened with my mom because I</p>
<p>just gave you a situation where I had people to lean on and the situation with</p>
<p>my mom she had no one she had no one to go to she had no one to help her she</p>
<p>know what a turn to so I&rsquo;m gonna tell you how she got herself through the</p>
<p>fucking panic attack of everything that happened but I have to give you a little</p>
<p>bit of a background story of what caused it so a couple episodes back I talked</p>
<p>about my stepdad Josh and that&rsquo;s who my mom was with at the time he used to like</p>
<p>torture us and physically abuse us in the weirdest fucking ways but one of the</p>
<p>main things that he would fucking do is he would attack us without us knowing to</p>
<p>prepare us like he was very protective of us but he would attack us to teach us</p>
<p>so something he did to my mom one night this is just one of the many fucking</p>
<p>things he&rsquo;s did it to both of us like he got the weirdest enjoyment out of seeing</p>
<p>people in fear and knowing he caused it so with my mom one night she was at</p>
<p>Walmart and she walks out with her groceries and her shit she goes to her</p>
<p>car and she&rsquo;s like putting shit in her car he came up from behind her put her</p>
<p>in a headlock and choked her out cold she didn&rsquo;t know who it was he just</p>
<p>attacked her and like knocked her out and she said that she woke up sitting in</p>
<p>her car with all the groceries in the trunk she didn&rsquo;t know what the fuck</p>
<p>happened she just knew like someone grabbed her come to find out it was him</p>
<p>but he always told her bitch be ready have your fucking gun in your purse have</p>
<p>your fucking gun in your hoodie you need to walk out of a store with your hood up</p>
<p>you need to be aware of your surroundings shoot through your purse</p>
<p>shoot through your hoodie literally do not ever have your guard down and then</p>
<p>he would test us after he would prepare us and this is something that he did to</p>
<p>her one night and nothing scared this man like this man was literally</p>
<p>invincible and he didn&rsquo;t care that he had my mom like carrying a gun and told</p>
<p>her to shoot like he wasn&rsquo;t scared of a gun I&rsquo;d seen him get guns pulled on him</p>
<p>and he would laugh and still attack the person and beat them with their own gun</p>
<p>like he wasn&rsquo;t scared of anything so he literally was like attacking her even</p>
<p>though he knew she had a gun on him and if she did shoot him he&rsquo;d have been</p>
<p>proud but the same way he taught her how to be there and like protect herself</p>
<p>with the gun he taught me how to do it with a knife because I wasn&rsquo;t of age yet</p>
<p>to be carrying a gun so he prepared me of how to knife fight and like protect</p>
<p>myself so he always made sure I had my shit on me and uh so the night happened</p>
<p>where he choked my mom out in the parking lot and then put her in the car</p>
<p>and left so that&rsquo;s one situation but another situation he used to do to her a</p>
<p>lot is my mom is claustrophobic so he would like lay her on the bed and get on</p>
<p>top of her and he was like 6 foot 5 and like 240 pounds like he was bigger than</p>
<p>me I&rsquo;m 6 foot 7 but like I&rsquo;m like 230 now but like back then he was always</p>
<p>bigger than me we&rsquo;re like around the same size now but he would get on top of</p>
<p>her hold her down until she would start freaking out hyperventilating and crying</p>
<p>like he would send her into a full panic and got enjoyment from it like he just</p>
<p>liked to take your fear and put it against you he got enjoyment out of</p>
<p>seeing that so he like would hold her down and not let her move and so she</p>
<p>would freak the fuck out and cry and hyperventilate and would like full-on go</p>
<p>into a panic attack like thought she was gonna die and there&rsquo;s been a lot of</p>
<p>situations where he did like shit with me we&rsquo;re like he would prepare me while I</p>
<p>was sleeping so like he would attack me while I was sleeping so that I was</p>
<p>always ready and he would like have a knife to my throat while I&rsquo;m asleep and</p>
<p>wake me up and like expect me to protect myself but like he taught me how to be</p>
<p>on guard even when I&rsquo;m asleep so I don&rsquo;t sleep now like my friend Randy the other</p>
<p>day like I fell asleep at his house and I was on the couch because we were like</p>
<p>drunk from going out and I&rsquo;m over here knocked out on the couch but Randy like</p>
<p>comes up to me with a blanket and tries to put it on me and I woke up out of my</p>
<p>sleep like kicking and like ready to like fight cuz that&rsquo;s what I was trained</p>
<p>to do that&rsquo;s what I was taught to do like I don&rsquo;t sleep out of other people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>houses I never fucking do but that&rsquo;s like night I just needed to I was too</p>
<p>drunk you know what I mean but even my drunk ass like I was in that was</p>
<p>ingrained in me to be aware and be ready even when you&rsquo;re sleeping and it took a</p>
<p>long time it took me getting my fucking ass beat a lot it took a lot of scary</p>
<p>ass shit with a knife sitting over my fucking face when I wake up or like a</p>
<p>knife to my throat or just getting beat in the fucking head to wake up it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>about me it&rsquo;s not about that I&rsquo;m just trying to paint a picture of what this</p>
<p>man would do and how he would fuck with you so he&rsquo;s been dead for around four</p>
<p>years now and I need to tell you that because it&rsquo;s important one of the things</p>
<p>that my mom wanted me to make sure I said was it&rsquo;s been years but when a</p>
<p>panic attack happens it&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s standing right in front of me because a</p>
<p>lot of the things that trigger her and the same thing with me a lot of things</p>
<p>that trigger her she knows it&rsquo;s been four years she knows he&rsquo;s dead but when</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s happening and when that fucking shit hits you it&rsquo;s literally like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>standing right there doing it all over again because of the way that you feel</p>
<p>so one thing I need to give you like background on before I get into my mom&rsquo;s</p>
<p>panic attack I know I&rsquo;ve given you a lot of background but just hang the fuck</p>
<p>on so my mom never wears clothes under her scrubs she never has she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>always been like weird about she&rsquo;s like what the fuck that&rsquo;s weird so scrubs are</p>
<p>like loose-fitting and I&rsquo;m almost claustrophobic so she always wears the</p>
<p>scrubs and it&rsquo;s like loose-fitting it&rsquo;s comfortable it&rsquo;s whatever and then she</p>
<p>works but the day she had a panic attack it was so fucking cold outside she</p>
<p>literally walked into work and was like fuck this shit and she left her</p>
<p>long-sleeved shirt on and she left her pants on under her scrubs so she puts</p>
<p>her scrubs on on top of her clothes for the first time and she went into work</p>
<p>and she said when she was working she literally started having a fucking panic</p>
<p>attack because her clothes were tight she couldn&rsquo;t move and it started</p>
<p>triggering her from the past of like the claustrophobic shit and the shit that</p>
<p>Josh would do to her so she had a full-blown panic attack at work and the</p>
<p>way she describes it was she said her heart was racing she was like full of</p>
<p>fear panic anxiety her chest was tight and she felt like she drank battery acid</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s how bad her anxiety attacks get when she like gets triggered and has</p>
<p>to relive shit but she was really like freaked out and my mom is very tough</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a very tough woman and she&rsquo;s able to handle a lot emotionally and</p>
<p>physically so when she gets overcome by some shit it&rsquo;s a lot like she knows how</p>
<p>to manage it like there&rsquo;s certain times well she&rsquo;ll be able to manage it and be</p>
<p>fine and there&rsquo;s certain times where she has to fucking take a Xanax but this is</p>
<p>one of the days where she had to take a Xanax so I asked her like how did she</p>
<p>fucking like deal with it so she said that she realized what was happening her</p>
<p>heart was racing she got into fight-or-flight mode she was having a</p>
<p>fucking panic attack so she went to the locker room took a fucking Xanax their</p>
<p>prescription shut the fuck up all right when you live with shit like this you</p>
<p>got to have something here and there I used to be prescribed them too because</p>
<p>of what happened with my ex and what happened with Josh and I like dealing</p>
<p>with all that I used to be prescribed Xanax for like when I had panic attacks</p>
<p>too but I don&rsquo;t take them no more I&rsquo;m like over it I just like to freak out so</p>
<p>she went in the locker room at work she took a Xanax and she took her clothes</p>
<p>off out from under her scrubs she put her scrubs back on she got rid of the</p>
<p>thing that was making her feel claustrophobic which was the clothes</p>
<p>underneath her scrubs so she got that off but that doesn&rsquo;t do anything when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re already having a fucking panic attack like once it&rsquo;s triggered there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no stopping it a big thing she does and a big thing that I do is we like to get</p>
<p>the fuck away from people so she went outside and sat down on a curb outside</p>
<p>and just was trying to calm herself down she said that she needs quiet when she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>having a panic attack she needs quiet she needs no distraction and nothing</p>
<p>else to take into consideration like I said before trying to take other people</p>
<p>into consideration other things into consideration you need to get rid of</p>
<p>that shit like when you&rsquo;re having an episode like that you just have to limit</p>
<p>it all so she went outside and the thing that she said that she had to do first</p>
<p>was like look at her surroundings right now and she had to start giving herself</p>
<p>a talk like she has to talk to herself and talk herself through it but she said</p>
<p>that she looked at the clouds she would look at the birds as they would fly by</p>
<p>because she says your brain you cannot stop it you cannot stop negative</p>
<p>thoughts but you can switch what you&rsquo;re thinking and you can switch where your</p>
<p>attention is if your attention is on the memories you&rsquo;re going to relive them and</p>
<p>she says the more that you entertain the memories of the situation that</p>
<p>happened like the more she would think about him attacking her the more anxious</p>
<p>she would get and the worse it would feel so you can&rsquo;t stop negative thoughts</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like right now if I tell you to think of a fucking coke what did you</p>
<p>think of bitch a coke you can&rsquo;t not think of things just because you tell</p>
<p>your brain don&rsquo;t think of it you&rsquo;re gonna think of it so she understands</p>
<p>that and she said her advice is make yourself have something else to think</p>
<p>about or focus on and direct your thoughts in a different way you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stop your thoughts but you can direct them and if you want to try and come at</p>
<p>me and say try and meditate to stop your thoughts shut the fuck up i&rsquo;m so glad</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been through nothing in your life bad enough where you can just solve</p>
<p>things with meditation it don&rsquo;t fucking work when you&rsquo;re having a panic attack</p>
<p>okay so she did start focusing on her breathing and then she started talking</p>
<p>to herself like she&rsquo;s the same as me like you have to talk to yourself you</p>
<p>have to get your breathing in check because your heart is fucking racing</p>
<p>like you have to get your breath in check focus on that and then she had to</p>
<p>start talking to herself and reassuring herself</p>
<p>focusing on the birds focusing on the clouds what you think you&rsquo;re experiencing</p>
<p>is not real what you&rsquo;re feeling is real but the situation is not happening</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not being attacked you&rsquo;re safe you&rsquo;re okay</p>
<p>josh is dead and there is no real threat like these are the things that she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>having to talk to herself and tell herself like look around your</p>
<p>environment see with your eyes that what is</p>
<p>happening is not the attack that you remember</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a different environment it&rsquo;s a different situation you&rsquo;re being</p>
<p>triggered from the past but it&rsquo;s not happening again</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what she had to reassure herself of but a big thing my mom said</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re gonna have to train your brain and this is something that she&rsquo;s had to</p>
<p>do and i&rsquo;ve had to do you have to train your brain how to</p>
<p>shift your thoughts when this is happening like you have to learn how to</p>
<p>observe what you&rsquo;re thinking what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>feeling and then train your brain to pick different thoughts like if you</p>
<p>start thinking of memories of like her getting choked out by josh or her</p>
<p>getting like smothered by him she had to start thinking of other</p>
<p>memories with him because it&rsquo;s too hard to not</p>
<p>think of the person if it was a person that did something to you</p>
<p>she started thinking of good memories with him and seeing him in a different</p>
<p>light and trying to do that and then she likes to start thinking of</p>
<p>things that make her feel joy like memories thoughts that make her feel</p>
<p>better make her feel good but the whole thing is is like while</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing this you&rsquo;re paying attention to your surroundings</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re aware what you&rsquo;re feeling is not the situation that happened it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>happening again you&rsquo;re safe now you&rsquo;re safe this time it&rsquo;s like with me</p>
<p>thinking back to berlin and i&rsquo;m over here like ready to fucking get jumped</p>
<p>i was not in that same situation i was like leo you&rsquo;re not in berlin</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in pensacola you&rsquo;re fine these people are not like attacking you it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nothing like that they&rsquo;re just standing there</p>
<p>you have to reassure yourself and remind yourself there is no threat and you are</p>
<p>safe in this moment my mom did it by looking at the clouds</p>
<p>watching the little fucking birds fly it sounds stupid but it&rsquo;s what fucking</p>
<p>works it&rsquo;s what helps pay attention to the way that the</p>
<p>weather feels on your skin what&rsquo;s the wind like what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>temperature feel your ass on the pavement feel your ass in your chair</p>
<p>like feel your feet on the ground literally touch yourself touch your hand</p>
<p>like i said touch your neck do something to like pacify yourself and</p>
<p>like bring yourself back to the moment right now of like okay</p>
<p>you are okay and you have to like calm your body down</p>
<p>and give your brain time to realize and fathom the fact that you&rsquo;re not reliving</p>
<p>it it&rsquo;s not happening again it just feels</p>
<p>like it is and don&rsquo;t expect this shit to be quick like you just have to let your</p>
<p>mind catch up as you calm your body down but</p>
<p>this is the way that we&rsquo;ve both found to go about it</p>
<p>so after my mom calmed herself down she said that she went back inside</p>
<p>back into work and she went into an operating room with no one else in it</p>
<p>because she didn&rsquo;t want to go be around people yet she went in and just started</p>
<p>getting busy she started doing busy work and tasks</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t require other people because when you&rsquo;re coming down off of</p>
<p>like an emotional high like that you don&rsquo;t need to be in an operating</p>
<p>room making life-altering decisions and being under all that pressure</p>
<p>she needed to warm herself back up to that so she went into a room and started</p>
<p>like organizing shit doing busy work and giving</p>
<p>herself a distraction and a task to do to divert her focus but also</p>
<p>nothing that was too like straining on like pressure so she</p>
<p>was just trying to distract herself get herself back adjusted to being back at</p>
<p>work she&rsquo;s good she&rsquo;s fine and then she felt</p>
<p>okay to go get back and be around people go back to work and go back in the</p>
<p>operating rooms and do her shit and one other thing that my mom says</p>
<p>that she does when she&rsquo;s having really bad anxiety attacks</p>
<p>i know this sounds like a weird ass plug but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of why i created it my app positive focus</p>
<p>she says if she just opens the app and scrolls through the quotes like if you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get a grip on what your brain is thinking like if you can&rsquo;t force</p>
<p>yourself to focus and think in a different direction</p>
<p>you need to be prompted go into my app and scroll through the different</p>
<p>questions scroll through the different quotes it&rsquo;s gonna flip your perspective</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not something that you&rsquo;re gonna intentionally have to do all you have to</p>
<p>do is open the app and reading the questions will do it for</p>
<p>you because it is a lot of effort to try and guide your focus when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>panicking or when you&rsquo;re going through it if you&rsquo;re not really good at handling</p>
<p>it it&rsquo;s a really good distraction for those</p>
<p>moments it will help you shift your perspective</p>
<p>and give you a distraction like i said so my mom actually uses the fuck out of</p>
<p>my app she loves it like whenever a notification comes through</p>
<p>of a quote like she&rsquo;ll be like oh my god like if she likes it she&rsquo;ll screenshot</p>
<p>it to me and send it to me and i&rsquo;m like mom i know i made the app</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;s so cute about it but she really does say that my app like just</p>
<p>having it there to scroll through helps a fucking ton but if you do want to</p>
<p>download that i truly think it will help you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s available for iphone and android the links will be in the description</p>
<p>check it out but you do have to be gentle with yourself you have to guide</p>
<p>yourself back through this and like i said</p>
<p>my mom has been at points where she couldn&rsquo;t handle it</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s had to teach herself how to so these are the biggest tips that she had</p>
<p>that she wanted me to share and i wanted to share</p>
<p>and then i gave you some of the tips that i had but one other thing that my</p>
<p>mom said when we were on the phone is she said</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crazy because you would literally walk by us</p>
<p>on the street and have no clue what the fuck we deal with like you would look at</p>
<p>me and never know what i deal with and what i go through</p>
<p>you would never look at her and think that</p>
<p>but everybody deals with it in some way shape or form</p>
<p>and it is worse for some people and it isn&rsquo;t as bad for some</p>
<p>but every single person you see has their own shit</p>
<p>has their own feelings has their own like chaos and like their own stress</p>
<p>moments every single one of us have them so do</p>
<p>not judge a book by its cover and like i said before people are going</p>
<p>to be a lot more understanding than you even realize</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t force yourself to sit with that shit alone</p>
<p>allow someone to help you allow someone to be there for you even if they&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>shit comfort person just be like just hold</p>
<p>my hand rub my back literally just stand there</p>
<p>with me when i&rsquo;m freaking the fuck out because a lot of people don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>to comfort they don&rsquo;t know how to fucking do it like or they&rsquo;re gonna fuck</p>
<p>it up and be weird make things worse but allowing people to be a space of</p>
<p>support trust me more people will want to do it</p>
<p>for you then you realize all of my friends if i turn to any of</p>
<p>them at any moment and said hey if i bug the fuck out we gotta go</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re totally gonna get it they&rsquo;re gonna be fine with it because they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>all dealt with similar things and i haven&rsquo;t talked to most of them</p>
<p>about things that they&rsquo;ve been through or anxiety attacks or panic attacks</p>
<p>or whatever it is but i just know and i fully believe they&rsquo;d all be there</p>
<p>for me because i&rsquo;m aware of human psychology</p>
<p>like you allow people to be of use to you and they like it</p>
<p>like if someone let me be the comfort for them when they were freaking out oh</p>
<p>my god like it&rsquo;s gonna make other people feel</p>
<p>good so allow them that give them that gift to be support to you and be your</p>
<p>comfort i don&rsquo;t know if that shot helped me</p>
<p>feel better or not i&rsquo;m just hot like am i sweating out the fever or what</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s where i&rsquo;m gonna leave this episode off we talked about a whole</p>
<p>bunch leave me a comment if you thought this was helpful and if you like this</p>
<p>video leave it a thumbs up and if you&rsquo;re listening to the audio</p>
<p>version leave me a five star rating bitch don&rsquo;t skimp me on the five stars</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re important and also if you do download my app</p>
<p>positive focus leave that a five star of youtube because those help</p>
<p>so much more than you fucking know but all of my links to all of my things and</p>
<p>everything you can keep up with me everything you need from me will be in</p>
<p>the description so check all that out if you&rsquo;re new here</p>
