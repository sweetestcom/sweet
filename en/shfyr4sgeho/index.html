we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about is being acid unhealthy I hear this so much where everyone needs to alkalize or you&amp;rsquo;re going to die right that we need to alkalize the body because acid is unhealthy first of all you need to know that your body has different acid and alcohol levels it&amp;rsquo;s not just one for example your saliva ranges between 6.5 and 7.5 so just realize 7 is neutral anything higher is alkaline anything lower is acid okay so we got six point five that&amp;rsquo;s slightly acid seven point five it&amp;rsquo;s slightly alkaline so your saliva should range and by the way when you go from a seven to an eight that&amp;rsquo;s by a factor of ten times more alkaline or seven to six is ten times more acid so it&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s magnified so it&amp;rsquo;s a lot of is slightly alkaline side slightly acidic small intestine seven to eight point five so your small intestine is usually slightly aklan but the large intestine is between four and six that&amp;rsquo;s acid interesting so check out the blood it&amp;rsquo;s a very very narrow range between seven point three five slightly alkaline and seven point four or five which is a little more alkaline it&amp;rsquo;s such a narrow range that&amp;rsquo;s interesting to me that it&amp;rsquo;s that tight of a controlled pH so I guess when people talk about being acid or alkaline or alkalosis or acidosis they&amp;rsquo;re really talking about the pH and the blood so if your pH is between like seven point four six or seven or eight you&amp;rsquo;re going to basically be have alkalosis if it&amp;rsquo;s seven point three four or seven point three three you&amp;rsquo;re going to be have acidosis even though it&amp;rsquo;s off just slightly okay but that&amp;rsquo;s a whole different seminar the point I want to make is that your body has different ph&amp;rsquo;s in different fluids your stomach should be between one and three you realize how acid that is it&amp;rsquo;s like seriously like acid it&amp;rsquo;s like battery acid your urine should be between four point five and six point O acid so we got the large intestine the stomach and the large and that urine should be acid a lot of the other fluids to be Ocwen so this whole thing that everyone should be alkaline is kind of like what tissue you talking about the purpose of having the right pH is that it allows the body to then release or activate enzymes let me give an example if your stomach is not acid enough it will not release the enzyme pep case the most powerful Pro T attic or protein enzyme so you&amp;rsquo;re not going to digest protein so what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen with that you&amp;rsquo;re going to get undigested protein allergies if the stomach is not asked enough you&amp;rsquo;re not going to be able to kill off viruses and bacteria and microbes if the stomach is not acid you&amp;rsquo;re not going to absorb minerals you&amp;rsquo;ll become anemic so there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of issues with just not activating enzymes also you need these differences in pH is to move fluid through the body to have things move if your body was just one pH things would just be stagnant they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t move that well so we need the diversity so the next time someone says oh yeah you&amp;rsquo;re too acid you need alkalis you&amp;rsquo;re like ask them what tissue are you talking about what fluid are you talking about on the blood and then it&amp;rsquo;s really hard to test the blood pH so you can soon as you take it on the body it oxidizes with air and it changes the pH so rarely does anyone ever test it so you got to go by symptoms basically but the pH that does change probably the only pH that doesn&amp;rsquo;t change dramatically out of all these fluids is the stomach pH as you age from twenty to thirty to forty to fifty to sixty seven years old look at how far down your stomach pH goes down you lose the acid in your ph in your stomach becomes more alkaline so the danger of that is that you&amp;rsquo;re going to lose the digestion so red meats going to be hard to assimilate so you&amp;rsquo;re going to get kind of like gas and bloating if you have too much you&amp;rsquo;re going to have gas is a perfect indication of low stomach acids floating as well also you need the strong pH to act to release the enzymes from the pancreas and the gallbladder it releases bile so you just don&amp;rsquo;t get those digestive secretions and then you end up with more bloating if you combine to many different foods at once especially with sugar you&amp;rsquo;re going to get some Suton and you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough acid your stomach gonna get some serious bloating in your stomach so we need a really strong pH so the older you get the worse the pH is in the stomach and then because the valve doesn&amp;rsquo;t close you get GERD and things like that but what do people take when they have indigestion acid reflux or heartburn they take anti acids so the older you get and the more you&amp;rsquo;re taking any acids what are you doing you&amp;rsquo;re taking that last bit of acid that you had and you&amp;rsquo;re making a go bye-bye so the older you are the more acidic you need to start you need to start putting things back in there like that&amp;rsquo;s why I recommend outside of vinegar so it&amp;rsquo;s so important if you just took everyone over the age of 50 and put them on opposite of vinegar you would see some amazing changes in digestion but but over time your blood peach doesn&amp;rsquo;t go you don&amp;rsquo;t lose acid in your blood pH you don&amp;rsquo;t lose in this lab or small intestine it&amp;rsquo;s mainly in the stomach so that&amp;rsquo;s the area that I would recommend focusing on so being too acid unhealthy no not if you&amp;rsquo;re talking about the stomach if you don&amp;rsquo;t like taping up a side of inner because of irritate your teeth whatever you can take it as a pill form episode of vinegar plus I&amp;rsquo;m changing the name to digestion digest support but this is good to take right before meal to help improve the completeness of your digestion specifically with proteins and to help support a healthy pH in your stomach all right thanks for watching hi guys hey listen I created a pretty amazing evaluation quiz down below that actually analyzes your symptoms to find the cause the root cause of all of your symptoms the most likely cause so take the quiz now and we&amp;rsquo;ll send you report"><title>Is ＂Acid in Stomach＂ Unhealthy？

unhealthy I hear this so much where everyone  </p><p>needs to alkalize or you&rsquo;re going to die right 
that we need to alkalize the body because acid  </p><p>is unhealthy first of all you need to know that 
your body has different acid and alcohol levels  </p><p>it&rsquo;s not just one for example your saliva ranges 
between 6.5 and 7.5 so just realize 7 is neutral  </p><p>anything higher is alkaline anything lower is acid 
okay so we got six point five that&rsquo;s slightly acid  </p><p>seven point five it&rsquo;s slightly alkaline so your 
saliva should range and by the way when you go  </p><p>from a seven to an eight that&rsquo;s by a factor of 
ten times more alkaline or seven to six is ten  </p><p>times more acid so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s magnified so 
it&rsquo;s a lot of is slightly alkaline side slightly  </p><p>acidic small intestine seven to eight point five 
so your small intestine is usually slightly aklan  </p><p>but the large intestine is between four and six 
that&rsquo;s acid interesting so check out the blood  </p><p>it&rsquo;s a very very narrow range between seven point 
three five slightly alkaline and seven point four  </p><p>or five which is a little more alkaline it&rsquo;s 
such a narrow range that&rsquo;s interesting to me  </p><p>that it&rsquo;s that tight of a controlled pH so 
I guess when people talk about being acid  </p><p>or alkaline or alkalosis or acidosis they&rsquo;re 
really talking about the pH and the blood so  </p><p>if your pH is between like seven point four six 
or seven or eight you&rsquo;re going to basically be  </p><p>have alkalosis if it&rsquo;s seven point three four or 
seven point three three you&rsquo;re going to be have  </p><p>acidosis even though it&rsquo;s off just slightly okay 
but that&rsquo;s a whole different seminar the point I  </p><p>want to make is that your body has different ph&rsquo;s 
in different fluids your stomach should be between  </p><p>one and three you realize how acid that is it&rsquo;s 
like seriously like acid it&rsquo;s like battery acid  </p><p>your urine should be between four point five and 
six point O acid so we got the large intestine  </p><p>the stomach and the large and that urine should 
be acid a lot of the other fluids to be Ocwen so  </p><p>this whole thing that everyone should be alkaline 
is kind of like what tissue you talking about the  </p><p>purpose of having the right pH is that it allows 
the body to then release or activate enzymes let  </p><p>me give an example if your stomach is not acid 
enough it will not release the enzyme pep case  </p><p>the most powerful Pro T attic or protein enzyme 
so you&rsquo;re not going to digest protein so what&rsquo;s  </p><p>going to happen with that you&rsquo;re going to get 
undigested protein allergies if the stomach is  </p><p>not asked enough you&rsquo;re not going to be able to 
kill off viruses and bacteria and microbes if the  </p><p>stomach is not acid you&rsquo;re not going to absorb 
minerals you&rsquo;ll become anemic so there&rsquo;s a lot  </p><p>of issues with just not activating enzymes also 
you need these differences in pH is to move fluid  </p><p>through the body to have things move if your body 
was just one pH things would just be stagnant they  </p><p>wouldn&rsquo;t move that well so we need the diversity 
so the next time someone says oh yeah you&rsquo;re too  </p><p>acid you need alkalis you&rsquo;re like ask them what 
tissue are you talking about what fluid are you  </p><p>talking about on the blood and then it&rsquo;s really 
hard to test the blood pH so you can soon as you  </p><p>take it on the body it oxidizes with air and it 
changes the pH so rarely does anyone ever test it  </p><p>so you got to go by symptoms basically but the pH 
that does change probably the only pH that doesn&rsquo;t  </p><p>change dramatically out of all these fluids is 
the stomach pH as you age from twenty to thirty  </p><p>to forty to fifty to sixty seven years old look 
at how far down your stomach pH goes down you lose  </p><p>the acid in your ph in your stomach becomes 
more alkaline so the danger of that is that  </p><p>you&rsquo;re going to lose the digestion so red meats 
going to be hard to assimilate so you&rsquo;re going  </p><p>to get kind of like gas and bloating if you have 
too much you&rsquo;re going to have gas is a perfect  </p><p>indication of low stomach acids floating as well 
also you need the strong pH to act to release the  </p><p>enzymes from the pancreas and the gallbladder 
it releases bile so you just don&rsquo;t get those  </p><p>digestive secretions and then you end up with 
more bloating if you combine to many different  </p><p>foods at once especially with sugar you&rsquo;re going 
to get some Suton and you don&rsquo;t have enough acid  </p><p>your stomach gonna get some serious bloating 
in your stomach so we need a really strong  </p><p>pH so the older you get the worse the pH is in 
the stomach and then because the valve doesn&rsquo;t  </p><p>close you get GERD and things like that but what 
do people take when they have indigestion acid  </p><p>reflux or heartburn they take anti acids so 
the older you get and the more you&rsquo;re taking  </p><p>any acids what are you doing you&rsquo;re taking that 
last bit of acid that you had and you&rsquo;re making  </p><p>a go bye-bye so the older you are the more acidic 
you need to start you need to start putting things  </p><p>back in there like that&rsquo;s why I recommend 
outside of vinegar so it&rsquo;s so important if  </p><p>you just took everyone over the age of 50 and 
put them on opposite of vinegar you would see  </p><p>some amazing changes in digestion but but over 
time your blood peach doesn&rsquo;t go you don&rsquo;t lose  </p><p>acid in your blood pH you don&rsquo;t lose in this lab 
or small intestine it&rsquo;s mainly in the stomach so  </p><p>that&rsquo;s the area that I would recommend focusing 
on so being too acid unhealthy no not if you&rsquo;re  </p><p>talking about the stomach if you don&rsquo;t like 
taping up a side of inner because of irritate  </p><p>your teeth whatever you can take it as a pill 
form episode of vinegar plus I&rsquo;m changing the  </p><p>name to digestion digest support but this is 
good to take right before meal to help improve  </p><p>the completeness of your digestion specifically 
with proteins and to help support a healthy pH  </p><p>in your stomach all right thanks for watching 
hi guys hey listen I created a pretty amazing  </p><p>evaluation quiz down below that actually analyzes 
your symptoms to find the cause the root cause of  </p><p>all of your symptoms the most likely cause so 
take the quiz now and we&rsquo;ll send you report</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
