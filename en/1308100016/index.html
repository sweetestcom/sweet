    <p>Well, what have you had it with this week?</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve had it with is the inefficiency of people in the self-checkout line.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that hard to do it.</p>
<p>So this is what happened the other day.</p>
<p>I need like three things.</p>
<p>So I run in, I don&rsquo;t even get a cart, I just am holding them in my hand.</p>
<p>I go to the self-checkout, 25 or less, so I&rsquo;m thinking this will just be a one-minute</p>
<p>deal.</p>
<p>There are two guys, one girl and one old man.</p>
<p>They were at least 100 years old, they were so old.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t the problem.</p>
<p>There was this girl that I would say was probably 30-ish.</p>
<p>She had her cart.</p>
<p>She was getting like one item from the cart, walking over to the scanner, scanning it.</p>
<p>The two old people finished before her.</p>
<p>I finished before her, but while I was waiting on her, I envisioned that I was taking my</p>
<p>items and like chunking them as hard as I could at her, and they were hitting her on</p>
<p>the head, and it was knocking her down because I was just homicidal of how inefficient she</p>
<p>was.</p>
<p>I mean, why the fuck does it take so long?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you have all your stuff ready to bar scan?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go back to your cart every time.</p>
<p>Pull your cart up there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some serious self-checkout at it that needs to be instituted across the board.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I think what I find most remarkable about this is that you are good at self-checkout.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the best.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve gotten better.</p>
<p>In the beginning, I was really hard, but now I can probably &hellip; I know where the labels</p>
<p>are and all that, but I&rsquo;m efficient.</p>
<p>I have it all lined up and ready.</p>
<p>I am not going to go back and forth to my cart for every item like a fucking bozo.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like two senior citizens, one foot in the grave.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve taken to the technology.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a millennial, and you can&rsquo;t check any faster?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s disturbing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s horrible.</p>
<p>I relate to the homicidal rage that you felt.</p>
<p>Homicidal.</p>
<p>I feel that often out in the public.</p>
<p>General public.</p>
<p>With people.</p>
<p>You know, when you go to a store or a retailer, and somebody bumps into me, or you&rsquo;re kind</p>
<p>of walking down an aisle somewhere, and somebody just stops, and then you&rsquo;re about to bump</p>
<p>into them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It just &hellip; I feel that often.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad grocery store etiquette.</p>
<p>It really, really is bad grocery store etiquette.</p>
<p>And what do you do when somebody&rsquo;s like yahooing the yogurt?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to make an informed decision about the yogurt.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re reading the labels.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re basically hogging up the entire thing.</p>
<p>Do you wait?</p>
<p>An aisle hogger.</p>
<p>Or do you just move in?</p>
<p>I move in.</p>
<p>I move in, too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, excuse me, slow poke.</p>
<p>I give about five to seven seconds to see if they&rsquo;re going to go in, get their item.</p>
<p>But if they&rsquo;re just eye-fucking all the yogurts, you have to go in.</p>
<p>You have no choice but to go in and get your stuff.</p>
<p>And I think if you&rsquo;re struggling this hard on which yogurt to buy, the bigger mountains</p>
<p>you have to climb in life, it&rsquo;s tough on them.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>An aisle hogger at a grocery store really irritates me.</p>
<p>And then sometimes I find this very irrational rage.</p>
<p>Like I go to turn my cart to make a U-turn from one aisle to another, and there&rsquo;s a cart</p>
<p>right there.</p>
<p>They really haven&rsquo;t done anything wrong.</p>
<p>But in my mind, I think, God damn it, get out of my fucking way.</p>
<p>Like this super entitled, like I&rsquo;m turning here and your cart&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really irrational.</p>
<p>So I experience a lot of irrational, homicidal rage at the grocery store, which is why most</p>
<p>of the time I do the grocery delivery.</p>
<p>Because then I just, I don&rsquo;t have to deal with that experience.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s a nice feature.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what I&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical commercials, side effects maybe, diarrhea, vomiting, suicidal thoughts, homicidal</p>
<p>rage.</p>
<p>Constipation.</p>
<p>Cancer.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just like by the end of it, I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t fucking want this.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t want to take that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want this at all.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, it starts off very innocent.</p>
<p>Like here&rsquo;s, here you are at the park pushing your kid on a swing and you have sinus problems,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And then it shows like, you know, kind of like dust swirling or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, but your eyes get runny.</p>
<p>We have this new drug for you and it&rsquo;s going to be so great, except for it&rsquo;s probably going</p>
<p>to make you shit yourself and want to kill yourself.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, how on earth is this such a great, A, marketing plan and B, I do think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of weird that like our medical system is so geared for profit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird that medicine, because I can&rsquo;t just go in and say, hey, I want Viagra.</p>
<p>You have to have a prescription.</p>
<p>And I say Viagra because I just, the only medical commercial that I remember is the</p>
<p>erection for lasting more than four hours.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like, are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s like the worst side effect ever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather just throw up for days.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve touched on that on episodes in the past where men are juicing, you know, and</p>
<p>skirting the system.</p>
<p>But I agree.</p>
<p>I mean, that is just, that is too long of a time to have an erection.</p>
<p>I mean, even if Brad Pitt came at me with that, I would say no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too long.</p>
<p>Every time I see these commercials, every time I see them on the television, I get so</p>
<p>irritated by it, by the whole process of it, that it causes all these side effects, that</p>
<p>these pharmaceutical companies are making gajillions of dollars to where they&rsquo;re advertising,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re hustling doctors, you know, taking them on trips.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a whole racket, the whole thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like other countries, you just have medical care.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not perfect.</p>
<p>Your doctor just tells you.</p>
<p>But ours isn&rsquo;t either.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this massive for-profit thing.</p>
<p>Like I think, you know, those little cups, pill cups, that if you&rsquo;re in the hospital,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just these little tiny paper cups.</p>
<p>Time Magazine or somebody did some expose on the medical.</p>
<p>The insurance companies bill like $15.</p>
<p>For those little cups?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Emily had a New Year&rsquo;s Eve party at my house.</p>
<p>With jello shots?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a thousand of those cups.</p>
<p>You could be making a shit ton of money.</p>
<p>A millionaire-ess.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>With my little hospital cups.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>See, that&rsquo;s such a racket.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a total racket.</p>
<p>And I think all of these side effects, I don&rsquo;t need to hear when I&rsquo;m watching television.</p>
<p>I want to hear about people having diarrhea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not-</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Convulsive.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Then it makes me not want to ever take it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But do you ever remember the names?</p>
<p>I never remember the names.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always like-</p>
<p>Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s like, you know, like, Futurista.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s always some weird, you know, kind of new-agey kind of medical-</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Just a whole bunch of consonants with a vowel thrown in.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Just like words you could never roll off the tongue.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I completely agree.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about today.</p>
<p>You know what we have to do?</p>
<p>Welcome to our podcast.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Welcome to our podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called I&rsquo;ve Had It, where we air the pettiest of grievances.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re also a podcast about positivity and homicidal rage.</p>
<p>Make sense of it what you will.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jennifer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Angie.</p>
<p>A.K.A.</p>
<p>Pumps, Angelina Pumpkatina.</p>
<p>We have Kylie, Jen, Nellie, and Richard with us today.</p>
<p>Today we are going to talk about something that is so important, and it is the issue</p>
<p>of fake food allergies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taking over the world.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Because there are real food allergies, and those are real.</p>
<p>And those people hardly ever talk about them.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the fake food allergy people that are the worst, that are causing a lot of problems</p>
<p>for all of us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been asked so many times in my life when I order food if I have food allergies.</p>
<p>That is so weird that they do that now at restaurants for the most part.</p>
<p>Which I think the burden falls on the person.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the afflicted, then it falls on you to make sure they know that.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Our guest today is spectacular.</p>
<p>In every way.</p>
<p>In every single way imaginable.</p>
<p>She is a boss bitch.</p>
<p>Big titty energy, big pussy energy, big dick energy, big bad boss bitch energy.</p>
<p>She is amazing.</p>
<p>Her name is Ashley Longshore.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s an artist from Mississippi, but now has her studio in New Orleans.</p>
<p>Fabulous artist.</p>
<p>Incredible artist.</p>
<p>And you can always spot what&rsquo;s hers.</p>
<p>Immediately.</p>
<p>Immediately.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so unique.</p>
<p>Happy art.</p>
<p>Colorful.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>No, she is the shit.</p>
<p>She is the shit.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get Ashley on here.</p>
<p>Ashley motherfucking Longshore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so happy to see you guys.</p>
<p>We are so happy to see you.</p>
<p>We are so happy to see you.</p>
<p>And what we want to do is be happy with you bitching about shit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we want to do.</p>
<p>We want to just-</p>
<p>Oh, let&rsquo;s go on rants.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s fucking go off.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go off.</p>
<p>I genetically am blessed.</p>
<p>I come from a long line of ranters.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really just in my blood.</p>
<p>Well, okay, Ashley, why don&rsquo;t you, first of all, this is Pumps.</p>
<p>You know me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jennifer.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>And so what we want to talk to you about today is just tell me the top two things right off</p>
<p>the top of the bat that you&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>Right now, I don&rsquo;t have on any underwear.</p>
<p>Actually, I threw away all of my underwear.</p>
<p>I think underwear is a scam.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>But also, I don&rsquo;t like thong.</p>
<p>Thong underwear hurts my asshole and I don&rsquo;t know how people do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like what it does to your taint, it ain&rsquo;t right.</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t like being forced by media into thinking that I have to eat foods to be thin</p>
<p>that are just going to make me shit in my pants or sneeze or laugh really hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if I&rsquo;m not eating foods that give me diarrhea, then I&rsquo;m not eating correctly.</p>
<p>So off the top of my head, I&rsquo;m kind of mad at those things.</p>
<p>Well, I can tell you I&rsquo;ve totally had it with any sort of diet trend.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re all rackets and they trot one out every 30 to 60 days.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, here&rsquo;s the new diet racket.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ll run into somebody and they&rsquo;re like, oh no, I&rsquo;m doing this diet.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s some like crash diet, 30 days, they lose 10 pounds.</p>
<p>Then you see them three months after that and they put back on 20.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, these things don&rsquo;t fucking work.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And also, I wear a necklace most days, I don&rsquo;t have it on today, that says, I would fuck</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>I wake up in the morning and I do naked jumping jacks in front of the mirror because nothing</p>
<p>else the rest of the day can be that horrific, first of all.</p>
<p>Second of all, it&rsquo;s like, you know what?</p>
<p>I love me some motherfucking me.</p>
<p>Goddamn, I love me.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want anybody telling me why I can&rsquo;t just like, boom, this is what it is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also never had a hard time getting a man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been with my man for 17 years.</p>
<p>He ain&rsquo;t never turned it down.</p>
<p>All they want is a fucking titty and a hank of hair anyway.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>I got that for you.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so let&rsquo;s talk about the faking fakers that say they&rsquo;re allergic to gluten until</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 2 a.m. and they&rsquo;re drunker than Kuda Brown.</p>
<p>I mean, absolutely schnockered out of their minds.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, somebody orders a cheese pizza and Julie, you know, the tri-delt is</p>
<p>scarfing down the whole fucking pizza, not even sharing any.</p>
<p>So what are your thoughts on that?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I have to say I&rsquo;m not friends with anyone that&rsquo;s gluten free.</p>
<p>Are they just removed?</p>
<p>No, I just I know I&rsquo;ve had it with that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just had it with that.</p>
<p>I have to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just had it with that, you know.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s exhausting because there is a small percentage of the population, like point zero</p>
<p>one percent, that have celiac disease, which is real and it is fatal and they can&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>gluten. They don&rsquo;t fucking talk about it.</p>
<p>But these these the other ninety nine point nine percent of these people are lying</p>
<p>liars.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I think that they&rsquo;re self-diagnosed.</p>
<p>A lot of 100 percent.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not allergic to gluten.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just a cunt.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t feel good because you are a cunt.</p>
<p>Gluten ain&rsquo;t got nothing to do with your issues, baby.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s so true.</p>
<p>I mean, we were just talking about earlier when I go to order food at a restaurant,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re always like, is there any food allergies we need to be made aware of?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, enough, enough with the food allergies.</p>
<p>People who have food allergies, genuine food allergies, because I have a couple of</p>
<p>friends that do, they handle that shit on their own with the waiter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m tired of constantly being asked about the food allergies.</p>
<p>They have to ask that because of the lawyers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true. Yeah, it&rsquo;s because of the lawyers.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re exactly right.</p>
<p>Whenever they ask me if I have any allergies, I say, well, I&rsquo;m allergic to bad service</p>
<p>and shit that&rsquo;s really basic.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s sassy.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>I know. I know.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably I probably had like a personality drink before I got to dinner,</p>
<p>which is why I would say something like that.</p>
<p>But when I but I mean it, you know.</p>
<p>OK, here&rsquo;s another one I have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just built up about this one.</p>
<p>OK, fucking almond milk.</p>
<p>I hate it.</p>
<p>You cannot milk an almond.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>I hate it.</p>
<p>How do you milk a fucking nut?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly.</p>
<p>It tastes like fucking cardboard.</p>
<p>And look, look, I drink it.</p>
<p>I drink gallons of it.</p>
<p>OK, like I drink it because because I hated fucking soy milk.</p>
<p>OK, and I don&rsquo;t have like a lactose allergy or any kind of shit like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like, it&rsquo;s got less calories and fucking milk and maybe it&rsquo;ll give me</p>
<p>diarrhea and I&rsquo;ll feel skinny all day.</p>
<p>I hate almond milk.</p>
<p>I hate it from the bowels of my soul.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how much I hate it.</p>
<p>I do love oat milk.</p>
<p>And let me tell you, I do have this really amazing friend.</p>
<p>God bless her.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s so fucking gorgeous.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s got the longest legs I&rsquo;ve ever seen on a human being.</p>
<p>She she&rsquo;s all into like health food, but she&rsquo;s not annoying about it.</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t talk about that.</p>
<p>You know, she just she&rsquo;s healthy on her own.</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t push it in by his face.</p>
<p>She used to make homemade cashew milk.</p>
<p>Have you ever had that?</p>
<p>Never. Oh, that is that is worth talking about.</p>
<p>Cashew milk is the like it&rsquo;s sweet and rich and decadent and unbelievable.</p>
<p>It is everything any other nut would want to be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, give me that nut, baby.</p>
<p>Give me that. No, give me that.</p>
<p>But I hate I hate almond milk.</p>
<p>I hate it. Yeah, it&rsquo;s stupid.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Actually, actually, I&rsquo;m about to start an Instagram page</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just about how much I fucking hate almond milk.</p>
<p>Almonds are dead to me. Dot com.</p>
<p>So let me ask you about going commando all the time.</p>
<p>So you go you go commando downstairs all the time.</p>
<p>What about free the net, free the tip bras?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on there?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a bra on right now.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. So bad shit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to go to Palm Beach for a show in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>You know, you can&rsquo;t go to Palm Beach without fucking underwear. Right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain there&rsquo;s certain etiquette you have to follow.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go to Palm Beach with your pussy hanging out.</p>
<p>Everybody knows that I&rsquo;m in a relationship.</p>
<p>Now, if I was trolling for an 80 year old billionaire, honey, you best believe</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be flapping these pussy lips all over.</p>
<p>No. And I actually one of the things I have to wear is a white dress.</p>
<p>I have a fucking thong.</p>
<p>And so my asshole is just going to have to take a beating</p>
<p>for the sake of capitalism.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, sacrifices have to be made at times.</p>
<p>Yes, honestly.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I&rsquo;m an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m running a company. I don&rsquo;t have time for all of this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t. I think you can start.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just I&rsquo;m supposed to have diarrhea.</p>
<p>Right. And be conscious of my you&rsquo;re not supposed to think about your butthole.</p>
<p>Right. Right.</p>
<p>Like, why am I wearing something that I&rsquo;m like?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m painfully aware of my asshole all day long, you know,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to be a lady at all these art shows and stuff.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m like, oh, my God, do I have a hair on my chin?</p>
<p>Did I wax my nose?</p>
<p>Is my gray hair showing or my eyelashes long enough?</p>
<p>Is my am I going to have to put on a bathing suit?</p>
<p>Have I waxed my fucking muskrat?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p>So many hairs that come in different places as you age.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>But I think you&rsquo;re kind of talking to because we both work pumps as a lawyer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an interior designer, as you know, because I buy Ashley&rsquo;s art for my projects.</p>
<p>But as a woman, you have to do so many more things.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many more things you have to be aware of when you&rsquo;re running a</p>
<p>business. And and I think it&rsquo;s just a lot.</p>
<p>And you paint a lot of amazing women.</p>
<p>And she has this Diane von Furstenberg.</p>
<p>I was walking around New York and I just happened upon that fabulous show</p>
<p>by accident. I didn&rsquo;t know it was going to be there.</p>
<p>Josh and I go in.</p>
<p>It is like this whole gallery full of all these powerful boss</p>
<p>bitches that Ashley has painted.</p>
<p>And I think that is what that is.</p>
<p>My favorite vibe of all of your artwork are the powerful boss bitch paintings.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re amazing. Mine, too.</p>
<p>They make me brave.</p>
<p>They make me very brave.</p>
<p>Those are just you know, and Diane, I worked with her and she curated those.</p>
<p>And God, she&rsquo;s so amazing.</p>
<p>And yeah, I&rsquo;m so glad you got to see that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually in a museum now and it&rsquo;s going to be traveling around.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m amazing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m adding to it, actively adding to that to that collection.</p>
<p>But, you know, you see all those women and the things that they accomplished</p>
<p>and the things that they didn&rsquo;t and how they handled their failures.</p>
<p>And right now and then, you know, they are women at a different time.</p>
<p>A lot of them than where we are right now.</p>
<p>And and, you know, they are going through the same shit that we&rsquo;re going through.</p>
<p>And, you know, we just we just got to do the fucking best we can.</p>
<p>Right. That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But I do feel like, you know, I&rsquo;m forty seven.</p>
<p>And I do and I was saying this to my man the other night, I said, you know.</p>
<p>You get to be this age and you&rsquo;re running a company and you&rsquo;re fighting</p>
<p>the hair battle and you&rsquo;re painfully aware of your asshole.</p>
<p>You may or may not give you diarrhea if you&rsquo;re lucky.</p>
<p>And people are trying to give you a fucking almond milk latte.</p>
<p>And, you know, you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re battling people with gluten disorders.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a fucking jungle out there.</p>
<p>You get to this point and it&rsquo;s like you realize why nobody says,</p>
<p>damn, I really want to go out there and find me like a 48 or 49 year old woman.</p>
<p>That is the God&rsquo;s truth.</p>
<p>Because you know what? I&rsquo;ve just had it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just I&rsquo;ve just had it.</p>
<p>Yes. And I know what I don&rsquo;t like and I know what I love.</p>
<p>And, you know, I take care of myself.</p>
<p>But, you know, shit, man.</p>
<p>Actually, I relate to that because I think when because I built a business as well.</p>
<p>And so when you&rsquo;re doing it, you&rsquo;re in this just grind mode.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing it. You&rsquo;re like, OK, I&rsquo;m going to make it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do it. And everything&rsquo;s happening so quickly.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden you reach a level of success and you can exhale</p>
<p>and you can look back and go, OK, I have financial security.</p>
<p>I have built something here.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden I noticed a little bit of homicidal rage</p>
<p>set in, not actively throughout the day, but like I just my tolerance</p>
<p>level for bullshit is completely diminished.</p>
<p>I mean, completely diminished.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m much happier with me.</p>
<p>I like the 48 year old version of myself much better than I did.</p>
<p>The 28 year old version or the 38 year old version, 100 percent I did.</p>
<p>But I just when people are, you know, selling some form of bullshit,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s their gluten, fake gluten allergy or fake busy people,</p>
<p>fake busy people really fucking irritate me.</p>
<p>And we all know fake busy people.</p>
<p>And I just feel this like, oh, God, put a sock in it.</p>
<p>But I I can&rsquo;t tell you how many people I know</p>
<p>that literally have fucking nothing to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking. They don&rsquo;t have jack shit to do.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve got to get away from those people.</p>
<p>Those are the scariest people.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, they are. And they tell you how busy they are.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, this is a complete fake busy person.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have a job doing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. You don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have a job.</p>
<p>Kids all day. I know what they do.</p>
<p>I know exactly what they do.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re chronic masturbators.</p>
<p>They are absolutely that busy.</p>
<p>They are absolutely.</p>
<p>It has to be. It&rsquo;s the only thing that makes them charging all those devices.</p>
<p>Yes. Double D batteries.</p>
<p>These people go through like Amazon boxes piling up on the curb.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, they&rsquo;re chronic masturbators.</p>
<p>I mean, they have got to be chronic masturbators.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Pumps was talking about how before you came on, how she was at the checkout</p>
<p>counter at the grocery store.</p>
<p>And there was somebody that was an inefficient self checker outer.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s just like taking no tolerance.</p>
<p>None. I don&rsquo;t even go to that lane.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even go to that lane because I also have the rage.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I can&rsquo;t watch you try to do this. Right.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>No, I am so with you on that.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t really thought about how much that irritates me.</p>
<p>But when I even see the self checkout, I roll my eyes back in my head.</p>
<p>So far, like I roll my eyes so far back, I can feel it in my gut. Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can&rsquo;t stomach it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>I mean, they have to have a self checkout helper</p>
<p>because everybody always fucks it up.</p>
<p>Yes. And so I&rsquo;m like, what is the logic behind this?</p>
<p>You already have the helper there anyway.</p>
<p>Just make another lane.</p>
<p>Yes, because it is really the self check.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m like, can we just continue just a little bit of services</p>
<p>that we had like remember back in the day when you could pull up</p>
<p>and somebody would pump your gas and you&rsquo;d pay more for full service?</p>
<p>I want that back.</p>
<p>I want that back.</p>
<p>In some states, they have that, I believe, in Oregon for environmental issues.</p>
<p>You can only get full service.</p>
<p>Yeah. But yeah, I do remember that because when I was 16,</p>
<p>my father had an account at a gas station like that,</p>
<p>and I was not supposed to be using it.</p>
<p>And I did. And I got in big trouble.</p>
<p>I got in real big trouble.</p>
<p>Those were the days when you could go and get gas, buy beer,</p>
<p>all on your parents gas card.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t know how sweet it was.</p>
<p>We had no idea.</p>
<p>What do you think about a person that goes on to like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say that let&rsquo;s say they watch this podcast or listen to a clip of us.</p>
<p>And instead of not liking what we&rsquo;re saying, they just scroll on.</p>
<p>They go ahead and go into the comments</p>
<p>and tell you specifically why they don&rsquo;t like you</p>
<p>and then also announce their departure, that they&rsquo;re going to unfollow you.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re talking about this long of a of a sentence.</p>
<p>What do you think about those types of trolls?</p>
<p>Well, chronic masturbators get on the Internet.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of times they&rsquo;re dehydrated.</p>
<p>Chronic masturbation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I would like to invite them over to my home for an almond milk latte.</p>
<p>We could talk about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to offer them a a selection of thongs from skims.</p>
<p>You know, I guess they&rsquo;re just some people that are just fucking assholes.</p>
<p>Instead, I take my energy and I make art about it.</p>
<p>And then I get paid.</p>
<p>Then I go get fucking naked on a yacht.</p>
<p>And some cashew milk.</p>
<p>You know, let&rsquo;s talk about how empowering it is as a woman</p>
<p>to have your own money in your own career and be beholden to no penises.</p>
<p>I ain&rsquo;t sucking a dick unless I want to.</p>
<p>I am. Should I? Preach.</p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of things I would suck dick for.</p>
<p>OK, let&rsquo;s hear him.</p>
<p>I mean, a fucking Gulfstream.</p>
<p>A hundred percent. Yes.</p>
<p>With a maintenance package and three pilots.</p>
<p>A hundred percent.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;ll give you a pinky up to the second knuckle.</p>
<p>There is no doubt.</p>
<p>No doubt. That is the best luxury on the planet.</p>
<p>Sometimes as an entrepreneur, because this shit is motherfucking hard.</p>
<p>On some days, I think, oh,</p>
<p>I just wish I wish I could just suck Uncle Sam&rsquo;s dick</p>
<p>instead of pay taxes.</p>
<p>Yeah. Oh, I would give Uncle Sam the meanest fucking blowjob.</p>
<p>I would cut the balls.</p>
<p>I mean, I would I would I would give it, you know, like a thumb.</p>
<p>If you wanted the thumb on that thing, you know, seriously.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. That is so good.</p>
<p>Ashley, I love it.</p>
<p>So what tell us what you&rsquo;re working on now?</p>
<p>Oh, well, I&rsquo;ve got that show coming up in Palm Beach.</p>
<p>So, you know, I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;ve finished the collection for that.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;ve started on a new collection</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m releasing right before Valentine&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve got a little champagne collaboration that I did.</p>
<p>So, you know, there will be bubbles down there in Palm Beach.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re launching that there.</p>
<p>And, you know, I&rsquo;ve just got my overall madness that I&rsquo;m working on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got some secret projects and something wild that I&rsquo;m doing soon.</p>
<p>Oh, I love it.</p>
<p>I saw your drunk royals loved them.</p>
<p>That is so good.</p>
<p>And people message us a lot and are like, what&rsquo;s your opinion on Harry and Megan?</p>
<p>And like and I&rsquo;m like, OK, everybody has a fucking opinion on it.</p>
<p>But I want to tell you guys mine.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the person I&rsquo;m most pissed off at</p>
<p>about the whole thing is King Charles.</p>
<p>King Charles needs to fucking step up to the plate and say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not taking the title away from my son.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing that. He is my son.</p>
<p>He will come to my coronation. He will be next to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sorry you&rsquo;re hurting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sorry that you feel hurt by your family.</p>
<p>But I am your father and I&rsquo;m here to love you and be with you</p>
<p>and be close to your children, my grandchildren.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s just completely excluded from that,</p>
<p>because if it were my cubs, I have two sons</p>
<p>and one of my sons was pissed off at me and felt aggrieved by something</p>
<p>that happened in their childhood,</p>
<p>which everybody has fucked up components to their childhood.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot of shit I&rsquo;m going to be hearing about in the future.</p>
<p>And I know that, you know, my husband, their dad is a recovering drug addict.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in recovery now.</p>
<p>And so we have some some issues there.</p>
<p>But if Dylan or Roman, one of my sons felt aggrieved</p>
<p>and felt hurt by our family of origin,</p>
<p>so much so to move out of the country,</p>
<p>I as the adult, even though he&rsquo;s 30, I would still be the mom and say,</p>
<p>listen, that is my son. I am so sorry he is hurting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not taking his title away. He will always be my son.</p>
<p>This is his birthright.</p>
<p>He will be front and center at my coronation, period.</p>
<p>End of story. Fuck you, British press.</p>
<p>Leave them alone.</p>
<p>And I just that has not happened.</p>
<p>It has not happened at all.</p>
<p>That is the antithesis of being a royal.</p>
<p>Right. Charles, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s ever been loved and nurtured.</p>
<p>Right. And you&rsquo;re a loving, nurturing, you know, mother.</p>
<p>He he wouldn&rsquo;t begin to know how to do that.</p>
<p>I mean, you heard Harry say that even after his mother died,</p>
<p>you know, he he would never even cry about it. Yeah.</p>
<p>And he went to school, you know, by himself and was kind of just thrown</p>
<p>to the wolves to deal with it without therapy or counseling.</p>
<p>I mean, I think as little girls where we grow up and think,</p>
<p>oh, wow, to be a princess or a queen. Right.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re really learning what that shit really means</p>
<p>on lots of different levels.</p>
<p>And I think it would just suck.</p>
<p>So it would suck so bad.</p>
<p>I think individually we all do what we want to do to be happy</p>
<p>in the very short amount of time that we&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>Kudos to Harry and fucking Megan.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I think, too.</p>
<p>Also, Harry&rsquo;s mother was was killed by the paparazzi</p>
<p>in the British media and all that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t blame the child for fucking me and having PTSD</p>
<p>and not wanting his woman.</p>
<p>And if you if you notice in my drunk royals collection,</p>
<p>Harry and Megan are not in that.</p>
<p>I noticed that I did notice that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I brought it up, too, because I figured that was why.</p>
<p>You know, the human existence is certainly a fascinating one.</p>
<p>That is the truth.</p>
<p>And you you like to go to bed really early and wake up super early, right?</p>
<p>I do do that a lot of times when I&rsquo;m not just on a full blown,</p>
<p>you know, wildness bender.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being productive, man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stacking up my fucking paper.</p>
<p>I got shit I want to do.</p>
<p>You got to sew.</p>
<p>You got it. You got a Gulf Stream.</p>
<p>You got to buy. That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Or or second deck putting it out here right now.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m pretty sure I can convince my man that it won&rsquo;t be an issue</p>
<p>more than happy.</p>
<p>And I know he wouldn&rsquo;t mind if he got to fly on it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more than happy to give someone an unbelievable fucking hummer</p>
<p>or a Gulf Stream.</p>
<p>I need it new and I need to pick out the interior.</p>
<p>I agree. Pilots and a full maintenance package.</p>
<p>For.</p>
<p>Let me look, I would like a butthole for that.</p>
<p>How many how many how many blowjobs in a row</p>
<p>consecutively would you give to get that Gulf Stream?</p>
<p>Oh, God. I mean, to get to get a Gulf Stream.</p>
<p>Yeah. Oh, bitch, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go. Bring them on. Bring them on.</p>
<p>I mean, for a Gulf Stream, I don&rsquo;t need a yacht. Right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even need a big ass mansion.</p>
<p>But to me, to be able to fly around on a PJ and for God&rsquo;s sake,</p>
<p>let me preface this.</p>
<p>I would also appreciate and I&rsquo;ll give somebody a pinky up</p>
<p>to the second knuckle to make this happen.</p>
<p>Please, can we have the Earth friendly fuel?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to take down the planet with this Gulf Stream.</p>
<p>OK, I&rsquo;m just trying to see my friends</p>
<p>and not have to go through security line. Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a miserable experience.</p>
<p>Miserable. Yeah, I need a Gulf Stream.</p>
<p>I need a soul douche. That&rsquo;s what it would do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it would do.</p>
<p>Well, Ashley, I cannot tell you.</p>
<p>This has been the highlight of our day.</p>
<p>We love you. We love your art.</p>
<p>We love the girl power shit.</p>
<p>We love the hadits with the fucking thongs,</p>
<p>the butt floss. Ashley has the best I&rsquo;ve hadits.</p>
<p>Yeah, your I&rsquo;ve hadits are I mean, they&rsquo;re going to go down</p>
<p>in our I&rsquo;ve had it Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only just gotten started. There&rsquo;s a lot more.</p>
<p>We might. A reoccurring segment.</p>
<p>Ashley&rsquo;s had it. I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to be a regular because this is the kind of I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here for this. I&rsquo;ve lived for this right here.</p>
<p>OK, this is the kind this is the kind of shit that we need.</p>
<p>This is the kind of shit that our listeners.</p>
<p>Yes, because when you get to be our age,</p>
<p>we have earned the right to say we have had it.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not going to sit around and pump unicorns up your ass all the time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all about positivity.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re also we find it therapeutic to get shit off our chest.</p>
<p>Yeah, like we didn&rsquo;t even get to talk about how we&rsquo;ve had it</p>
<p>with sneezing and pissing in our pants.</p>
<p>Exactly. And that&rsquo;s going to that is what we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to have you on for the next episode.</p>
<p>Ashley, go crush it in your white thong, in your white dress, in Palm Beach.</p>
<p>Please tell our listeners where they can find you.</p>
<p>Well, they can find me at Ashley Longshore Art.</p>
<p>They can find me if you need a PG version, which if God help you,</p>
<p>Ashley Longshore World,</p>
<p>go to my just fucking Google me, my God.</p>
<p>Ashley, we love you, you&rsquo;re the best.</p>
<p>If anybody can find me somebody that can get me a fucking Gulfstream,</p>
<p>bitch, I&rsquo;ll get you a painting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be my best friend forever. Yeah.</p>
<p>Love you, bitch.</p>
<p>We love you, Ashley. Bye.</p>
<p>Ashley almost killed me. She&rsquo;s so funny.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to kill you.</p>
<p>Ashley almost killed me. She&rsquo;s so funny.</p>
<p>She is so funny.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh. I want to go to New Orleans and be her best friend.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so refreshing.</p>
<p>Yes. Just to be around somebody who&rsquo;s so uninhibited</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re that way.</p>
<p>And I just I find it so refreshing to not worry about tiptoeing</p>
<p>and walking on eggshells and just saying, this is how I feel.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like it, fuck off. Fuck off.</p>
<p>Just fuck right on off. And her art&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Ashley&rsquo;s art is incredible.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s she has I mean, she&rsquo;s basically a celebrity artist.</p>
<p>And I am so grateful that we had her on our show.</p>
<p>And perhaps maybe she could do a painting of you.</p>
<p>Absolutely. I think for sure.</p>
<p>Powerful woman.</p>
<p>No bra with your fucking Stanley Cup.</p>
<p>I have to bring my Stanley with me.</p>
<p>And Ashley, if you listen to this episode, the next time we have you on,</p>
<p>I forgot to talk to you about these fucking Stanley Cups.</p>
<p>I wonder if she has one.</p>
<p>If she does, I&rsquo;m going to be so happy.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>You make me so happy.</p>
