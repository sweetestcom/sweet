    <p>fact that sacks his greatest moment in life was beating Peter</p>
<p>TL in a multi game chess. You ever see that picture of? Yeah,</p>
<p>of him with his arms raised. I can&rsquo;t believe he beat Pete. I</p>
<p>mean, tell us about that moment. Nick, show that picture of</p>
<p>sacks. I mean, listen, here&rsquo;s what I say when I saw when I</p>
<p>saw that picture. I had a couple thoughts. Number one, I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>this picture somewhere else. And then number two is oh my god,</p>
<p>it was on NBC&rsquo;s to catch a predator.</p>
<p>I mean, I have never seen sacks happier. I like the birth of his</p>
<p>children. Oh my god. This moment, I&rsquo;ll tell you that was</p>
<p>the day of PayPal&rsquo;s IPO. And so we did a party in the it was</p>
<p>like a keg party in the parking lot. That was the extent of the</p>
<p>celebration. And Peter did it off. He did a 10 game</p>
<p>simultaneous, which means he&rsquo;s playing against 10 people at</p>
<p>the same time, and he goes board to board makes his move. And I</p>
<p>was the only one out of the 10 that beat him. And somebody I</p>
<p>guess on the left, I put money down, I put like 20 bucks down</p>
<p>or something on the game, which is a foolish thing to do against</p>
<p>Peter because he&rsquo;s like a chess master. And and I somehow I won</p>
<p>and you can see I&rsquo;ve got the money in my hands. Great stuff.</p>
<p>Look at the look on Peter Thiel&rsquo;s face. It&rsquo;s losing. Look</p>
<p>at the look on p I mean, he&rsquo;s so angry. He and he but he sees</p>
<p>the joy in your face and he can&rsquo;t process it. And look at</p>
<p>Max Max is to my right and roll up and they&rsquo;re so pure joy.</p>
<p>Yeah. But this was a few seconds before Peter smashed all the</p>
<p>pieces off the board. And yeah, he flipped the board. He always</p>
<p>does that when he loses and his motto is when you call him a</p>
<p>sore loser. He says show me a good loser and I&rsquo;ll show you a</p>
<p>loser. Wow, such a great line. But I just want to also comment</p>
<p>on the pleats on sax&rsquo;s pants and how high that way</p>
<p>holster and the cell phone holster. Zoom in on the</p>
<p>cell phone holster. Is that a blackberry? It just keeps</p>
<p>giving. It&rsquo;s a free iPhone, guys. This is like, I mean,</p>
<p>this is like late 90s fashion. The gift that keeps on giving.</p>
<p>I do have to say Roloff&rsquo;s hair game. I mean, strong hair.</p>
<p>Roloff&rsquo;s always had incredible hair. His hair is incredibly</p>
<p>great hair to this incredible thick. Yeah, it&rsquo;s still thick</p>
<p>like that. Beautiful hair. Never noticed.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Sacks.</p>
<p>Alright, everybody. Welcome to another episode of the All In</p>
<p>podcast. With us again today, the dictator Chamath</p>
<p>Palihapitiya, Rain Man, David Sacks, and the Sultan of</p>
<p>Science, formerly known as the Queen of Quinoa. He&rsquo;s out of</p>
<p>that business. David Friedberg, we got a lot on the agenda.</p>
<p>However, one thing that we&rsquo;ve had a hard time figuring out is</p>
<p>the state of the supply chain. And it&rsquo;s confounding. It seems</p>
<p>like nobody knows what the hell they&rsquo;re doing. But there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>guy who&rsquo;s been on Twitter. And we happen to know him. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been on my pod and Friedberg knows him. And his name is Ryan</p>
<p>Peterson. And he&rsquo;s a bit of an expert on this. And we thought</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d have a bestie guestie come on. We don&rsquo;t do this too often.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s the third or fourth bestie guestie. And welcome to</p>
<p>the pod, Ryan Peterson from Flexport. What&rsquo;s up, guys?</p>
<p>Thanks for having me on. What&rsquo;s up, Ryan? Ryan, did you tell</p>
<p>Olivia you&rsquo;re doing the show today? No, I didn&rsquo;t tell her.</p>
<p>So, she&rsquo;s gonna, she&rsquo;s a huge fan. Oh, don&rsquo;t tell her. Where</p>
<p>is she right now? Is she like not there? She was in the room</p>
<p>next door but I told her, leave me alone. I&rsquo;m doing a podcast.</p>
<p>She knows I&rsquo;m doing a podcast. She doesn&rsquo;t know which one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome. Fantastic. She&rsquo;s a super fan. She&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>big fan. She&rsquo;s literally wearing the wet your beaks hoodie right</p>
<p>now. It&rsquo;s awesome. Fantastic. By coincidence, she doesn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on the show. Fantastic. So, what you&rsquo;re not gonna tell her,</p>
<p>right? She&rsquo;s just gonna watch my next show and you&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>on it? We&rsquo;ll listen to it. Yeah, we&rsquo;ll probably listen to it</p>
<p>together tonight whenever it comes out. Ryan, what is the</p>
<p>state now? Should we be worried about the supply chain? Is it</p>
<p>getting better? Is it getting worse? What&rsquo;s 2022 gonna look</p>
<p>like? Yeah, I mean, I think the supply chain means a lot of</p>
<p>things and it&rsquo;ll depend what your industry is, what&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>happening but it goes for everything from manufacturing</p>
<p>products, which means sourcing all the subcomponents like</p>
<p>semiconductors through logistics and final delivery all the way</p>
<p>to a customer store and where Flexport focuses on that is</p>
<p>sort of picking goods up from factories around the world and</p>
<p>delivering them into fulfillment centers all over the</p>
<p>world. So, kind of that global mile is what we sometimes call</p>
<p>it. There, you&rsquo;re seeing real disruption and it starts really</p>
<p>with the pandemic shift in consumer behavior where people</p>
<p>started buying more goods because they couldn&rsquo;t go to</p>
<p>restaurants and travel and things and so, a lot of spend</p>
<p>shifted onto goods and imports are up almost 20% imported</p>
<p>container volumes. So, that&rsquo;s the start of it all and then</p>
<p>what we learned is our infrastructure is dilapidated</p>
<p>and unable to handle a 20% increase and by infrastructure,</p>
<p>I mean, the number of ships in the world, the capacity of</p>
<p>throughput of the ports, the number of trucks and</p>
<p>availability of trucks and chassis, which is the trailers</p>
<p>that haul containers around. We just didn&rsquo;t have enough of</p>
<p>these things or the port capacity, you know, like, look</p>
<p>at American ports operate. This, I just learned the</p>
<p>statistic pretty recently and I keep saying it because it</p>
<p>appalls me. Our ports operate with a lower throughput and</p>
<p>productivity level than Mombasa, Kenya and you know, we</p>
<p>just do not have modern port infrastructure. Rotterdam&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been fully automated for 20 years. So, if they want to run</p>
<p>24-7 and keep containers flowing through the port, they</p>
<p>can do that with self-driving trucks and everything. Is that</p>
<p>a technology issue or do you think that&rsquo;s a regulatory</p>
<p>capture and union issue? Like a labor issue, like a labor. The</p>
<p>tech is there, you know, it&rsquo;s existed for a long, long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really about labor getting together with</p>
<p>management, negotiating these things and allowing it to</p>
<p>happen and the the way that our our ports are run is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty crazy when you look at it. They treat labor as a</p>
<p>fungible commodity is in the the port terminal operators</p>
<p>will say, I need this many workers tomorrow and the union</p>
<p>provisions that many workers but there&rsquo;s different people</p>
<p>every day doing operating complex, you know, heavy</p>
<p>machinery that you can&rsquo;t like the number one thing in</p>
<p>business is like, what did we learn today and how are we</p>
<p>going to do better tomorrow every day with your team? But</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a new team every day, like that&rsquo;s not even possible.</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t know how you can drive a productivity</p>
<p>improvement when it&rsquo;s different workers every single day of</p>
<p>the week, right? So, wait, they&rsquo;re not full-time</p>
<p>employees. They&rsquo;re like staffed by the hour. They&rsquo;re union</p>
<p>workers. They&rsquo;re paid by they have annual contracts. The</p>
<p>union decide who goes to work every day and who gets shifts.</p>
<p>Yeah. And where and so they&rsquo;ll show up at different</p>
<p>terminals and there&rsquo;s like fifteen different terminals.</p>
<p>So, they just kind of move around do different jobs.</p>
<p>Essentially, what we saw it on the waterfront. Yeah. Where</p>
<p>like the union decides you get to work today. These other</p>
<p>people didn&rsquo;t whatever. It&rsquo;s like literally like that movie.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. It&rsquo;s literally like that. Even going further back</p>
<p>in supply chains to manufacturing centers. How much</p>
<p>are you hearing about and seeing kind of labor shortages</p>
<p>because people are out for COVID and hey, someone&rsquo;s sick.</p>
<p>They got to take 10 days off. And when 10% of the employees</p>
<p>get sick and they lose 10 days of work, the facility sees a</p>
<p>decline in productivity to 70-80% of normal. And then all</p>
<p>of the output of that facility goes way down. Are you hearing</p>
<p>about more of that stuff happening, particularly during</p>
<p>this Omicron wave, where the real effect of that hasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really hit the supply chain system yet. And we&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>kind of seeing a buildup of demand and we haven&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>kind of hit the problems. So, for the last 18 months, China</p>
<p>had this total zero tolerance policy and was very successful</p>
<p>in keeping COVID out of their country. And so, manufacturing</p>
<p>just kept running as if not no problem in China, which is the</p>
<p>majority of this manufacturing. With Omicron, you&rsquo;re starting</p>
<p>to see that it is still taking hold in a zero tolerance policy.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t yet seen major shutdowns and waves of</p>
<p>shutdowns, but a little bit. You&rsquo;re seeing that here and</p>
<p>there. The zero tolerance policy has shown up, for example, at</p>
<p>least twice where one port worker in a Chinese port got</p>
<p>COVID and they shut the whole port down for like three weeks.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Which is really extreme. I mean, US workers have been getting</p>
<p>COVID nonstop and the ports keep operating, even though we</p>
<p>have lower levels of productivity, but they&rsquo;ll shut</p>
<p>the whole port down. That happened both at Yantian, which</p>
<p>is the largest port in China, or second largest, and Ningbo,</p>
<p>which is the third largest. So, it&rsquo;s been very, very</p>
<p>disruptive. It&rsquo;s also happened at the airports over there.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ll definitely keep an eye on here</p>
<p>over the next couple of months, or even next several weeks.</p>
<p>Are we still having this like, we&rsquo;re ordering too many goods</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re backed up? Or is it that we&rsquo;re backed up for six</p>
<p>months just trying to fulfill all those pandemic orders?</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s the state of the backlog today, if you could</p>
<p>describe it?</p>
<p>So, volumes are high, but they&rsquo;re sort of flat. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>year over year, they&rsquo;re flat now. They&rsquo;re much higher than</p>
<p>pre-pandemic, but they&rsquo;re pretty much flat year over year.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what has me so worried here, is that you have</p>
<p>increasing delays, even though the input&rsquo;s the same. And we</p>
<p>have a complex system where the same amount of input&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>in, but the delay&rsquo;s getting longer and longer. That&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>worrisome sign. Like, if you&rsquo;re ever building a technology</p>
<p>system, you&rsquo;re building this system and you&rsquo;re sending the</p>
<p>same amount of bits in and performing the job is taking</p>
<p>longer and longer. That would be a very alarming sign that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to want to send some of your best engineers in</p>
<p>here to debug the thing.</p>
<p>But I think we&rsquo;re seeing that because a lot of companies,</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t realize when they buy capital equipment, like</p>
<p>machines that are either sold to end users or machines that are</p>
<p>used in their own production systems, capital equipment is</p>
<p>typically assembled last minute. It&rsquo;s not like there are</p>
<p>companies that own huge pieces of equipment, and then they</p>
<p>ship them and they just get plugged in and turned on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s usually components associated with them. And in</p>
<p>businesses I&rsquo;ve been involved in over the last couple of</p>
<p>years, we&rsquo;ve got a lot of lab businesses and hardware</p>
<p>businesses. And just getting capital equipment has been like</p>
<p>delays like we&rsquo;ve never seen. It&rsquo;s like a year to a year and</p>
<p>a half for something that used to take four to six weeks to</p>
<p>arrive, because the company that makes that equipment is</p>
<p>having delays with each of their component suppliers.</p>
<p>And then all of this stuff backs up into the system. And</p>
<p>it plays out where the end user is now stuck waiting a year,</p>
<p>year and a half, and the business doesn&rsquo;t make progress.</p>
<p>And a lot of hardware companies in Silicon Valley right now are</p>
<p>facing these significant shortages, where they can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>the equipment they need to ship product to their customers.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re sitting around burning money every month. And</p>
<p>so the when the result will actually show up down the road,</p>
<p>when all of a sudden they miss revenue three, four quarters</p>
<p>down the road. And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been saying for, you know,</p>
<p>a couple shows now, that the biggest thing I&rsquo;m concerned</p>
<p>about is when the revenue shortfall start to hit the</p>
<p>companies that are dependent on these supply chains, but you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t actually see the revenue shortfall for a couple of</p>
<p>quarters after the supply chain problems hit them. And just</p>
<p>this quarter with the quarterly earnings, we&rsquo;re now seeing that</p>
<p>the company yesterday that reported called ingredient on</p>
<p>their big food ingredients company, and they just reported</p>
<p>how supply chain problems have now backed up to effect and the</p>
<p>stock was down like 10 11% yesterday. And this is like a</p>
<p>very stable, very mature, third largest producer of starch in</p>
<p>the United States, and their business got totally hammered,</p>
<p>but it took a while before that hit them. And so you know, it</p>
<p>feels to me, Ryan, I mean, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but</p>
<p>like, a lot of the the business level and market level risk</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t going to show up for a while after the supply chain</p>
<p>problems really persist within their organization.</p>
<p>This is the thing that has me most concerned is what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happened is it&rsquo;s now taking 115 days on average across our</p>
<p>customer base, from when the factory says, hey, these goods</p>
<p>are ready, come pick them up to when they finally get delivered</p>
<p>to a warehouse in the United States, 115 days, before the</p>
<p>pandemic, that was 50. And 50 even felt high, like the ship is</p>
<p>only taking 15 days, like what the heck is going on? A lot of</p>
<p>inefficiency, a lot of customs processing, hard to find a</p>
<p>truck, etc. Even in normal times, when you go to 115, all</p>
<p>of a sudden, these companies are so much less agile, like</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve placed the orders and you&rsquo;re expecting</p>
<p>forecasting demand is so hard. And now you&rsquo;re forecasting</p>
<p>demand for twice as long of a time period, you&rsquo;ve already</p>
<p>placed all that inventory, if your demand goes down, guess</p>
<p>what, you&rsquo;ve already ordered the goods. So I&rsquo;m really worried</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to find out in six months or in some time</p>
<p>period in the future here, that people have ordered way too</p>
<p>many goods that these companies expected demand to stay high</p>
<p>and keep booming. At some point, consumers start going to</p>
<p>restaurants and start traveling a lot more, you get pre COVID</p>
<p>consumption patterns. And all these companies get stuck with</p>
<p>way too much inventory that they paid way too much to ship</p>
<p>and get delivered and they can&rsquo;t sell it. And so I&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>very worried for like, middle market kind of retail,</p>
<p>directed consumer econ, these types of businesses that aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>very sophisticated in demand planning and end up with way</p>
<p>too much inventory. I think that there&rsquo;s been this weird</p>
<p>dispersion, actually. And I think that like the supply</p>
<p>chain issues are not broadly distributed. So if you bear with</p>
<p>me for a second, if you watch the earnings reports, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how closely you watch them Ryan this past couple weeks,</p>
<p>but like, Apple and Tesla basically said, it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>reasonably well managed, particularly on the chip side.</p>
<p>And we see the whole thing using q4 q1 of next year. Amazon</p>
<p>last night basically said, Yeah, there&rsquo;s some, you know,</p>
<p>toughness in the system, but we think it&rsquo;s sort of like, you</p>
<p>know, reasonably achievable. And they&rsquo;re past it. And so it</p>
<p>seems like the bigger companies who have influence, we&rsquo;re able</p>
<p>to manage through it, these smaller companies, to your</p>
<p>point, who really do rely on many actors in the supply chain</p>
<p>have been really thrown left and right, they probably don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know where demand really is. So is that sort of the more</p>
<p>nuanced actual the way that it&rsquo;s running out? Yeah. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sort of, it&rsquo;s very interesting to see this flip. So pre</p>
<p>pandemic, the biggest companies paid the least for freight,</p>
<p>because they buy the most freight. So they negotiate good</p>
<p>rates. Now they&rsquo;re paying the most. And the biggest companies</p>
<p>for a reason, they have the best businesses, they either have</p>
<p>the best margins, the best, you know, they just built something</p>
<p>that people want at scale to be huge. Well, when times are</p>
<p>tough, and you need to spend extra to prioritize your freight</p>
<p>to get loaded, to sign a contract and make sure that</p>
<p>these ship owners and airlines honor their commitments and</p>
<p>serve up step up. It&rsquo;s the big companies that can afford it.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re not paying extra for freight. But they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>around these problems. And freight is a really interesting</p>
<p>market, because it&rsquo;s pretty inelastic, like you&rsquo;re either</p>
<p>going to ship the thing or you&rsquo;re not the whatever the</p>
<p>price is, you probably still shipping it. And so like, you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t ever looked at an apple at this level. But I&rsquo;m sure that</p>
<p>if you did, you&rsquo;d see that it&rsquo;s a percent they spend on freight</p>
<p>is just negligible. So if they doubled it, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>But to Chamath&rsquo;s point, it seems like and I think we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>this a lot, the bigger companies can actually afford to integrate</p>
<p>their supply chains, whereas before it didn&rsquo;t make sense to</p>
<p>vertically integrate. Like I think Walmart announced that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve spent like 11 or $12 billion kind of rebuilding their</p>
<p>supply chain themselves. Apple obviously has captive</p>
<p>facilities all the way down to the fab, where they&rsquo;re driving</p>
<p>the whole supply chain from fab to components. All these Foxconn</p>
<p>facilities that are operated for them are captive facilities.</p>
<p>But Tesla, obviously, has a very deeply integrated supply chain</p>
<p>team, whereas GM probably relied on subs who relied on subs who</p>
<p>relied on subs. And that&rsquo;s why GM delivered like no electric</p>
<p>cars, but Tesla was able to keep volume up. The guys that are</p>
<p>winning are the ones that are integrating supply chains.</p>
<p>And do you think that that kind of becomes a persistent</p>
<p>solution here where bigger companies, their competitive</p>
<p>advantage becomes, hey, we&rsquo;re going to own our whole supply</p>
<p>chain all the way through, we&rsquo;re going to own more of the</p>
<p>infrastructure all the way through, like Amazon&rsquo;s done with</p>
<p>delivery vans, and ultimately be able to kind of, you know, have</p>
<p>a true competitive advantage because of this disruption</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on right now?</p>
<p>Yeah, potentially. I mean, I think my vision for Flexport is</p>
<p>that we become that layer and we allow small businesses, medium</p>
<p>sized businesses to get access to world class logistic services</p>
<p>and get them, you know, sort of almost be a union that can</p>
<p>represent them at the table against these bigger guys. I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s very interesting to see a company&rsquo;s like the biggest</p>
<p>companies have gone out and chartered their own ships.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Wild experiment to watch for my sitting here with popcorn.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re bringing up a really important effect of all of this,</p>
<p>which is what happens now in six or nine months to your point,</p>
<p>when the consumption of hard physical assets turns towards</p>
<p>the consumption of services, which it typically does, right?</p>
<p>If you revert back to the mean here, you know, people aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>going to be buying as many Pelotons and all of that stuff</p>
<p>because they bought them all, right? They bought all the</p>
<p>physical goods they need. And to your point, these companies have</p>
<p>over ordered all this inventory. Actually, Peloton is a perfect</p>
<p>example, because they basically shut down their entire supply</p>
<p>chain last at the end of this past quarter and essentially</p>
<p>said, our inventory turns will be more than enough to meet,</p>
<p>you know, existing demand for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an enormous capital problem that these companies now</p>
<p>all of a sudden will face, right? So like, the next step</p>
<p>beyond all of the supply chain issues could be, and I think</p>
<p>Saks has been talking about this a lot, like a pretty bad</p>
<p>recession, if these companies have all this inventory, and</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know how to get working capital.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;d be really ugly. And the other factor is the price</p>
<p>has gone crazy. So the price of shipping a container, long run,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve been in this business and been a customer of this</p>
<p>business for 20 years, and you can just rule of thumb, it costs</p>
<p>you 2000 bucks to ship a container from China to the West</p>
<p>Coast. During 2016, that price collapsed. So you have these</p>
<p>booming bus cycles of an asset market. 2016, it was 550 bucks.</p>
<p>Last year was $20,000. So it&rsquo;s up 10x over normal, it&rsquo;s up 40x</p>
<p>over or more right over just a few years ago. And what that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>done is create a real barrier to entry. Like for a DTC ecom</p>
<p>business, you used to be able to just go to China, find some</p>
<p>product, put your slap your label on it and go sell it on</p>
<p>Amazon, and you&rsquo;re in business. And there&rsquo;s like a huge number</p>
<p>of people doing this. Right now, you have to come up if you</p>
<p>want to ship 10 containers, it used to be you needed 20 grand.</p>
<p>Now you need 200 grand. That&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s a real barrier to</p>
<p>entry. So actually, I&rsquo;ve talked to some companies in this space,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re really happy. Like if you have an established business,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, great. Now, it&rsquo;s much harder for Joe Schmo to</p>
<p>show up in China and start competing with me. So I was</p>
<p>really surprised to hear that. I thought that was, I guess,</p>
<p>pretty sophisticated take.</p>
<p>What dollar point does air freight compete with containers</p>
<p>because when we start hearing about chips, I was always</p>
<p>wondering, and again, I&rsquo;m no expert. But putting a bunch of</p>
<p>chips on a plane versus putting them in a container, given how</p>
<p>much those chips are valued by a Tesla, whoever&rsquo;s putting them</p>
<p>into, you know, a car isn&rsquo;t what was the break?</p>
<p>Certainly, but air freight price has just gone in line. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gone up five as well. And one thing to remember is that</p>
<p>50% of all the world&rsquo;s air freight flies in the belly of</p>
<p>passenger planes, which should kind of horrify you if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>ever flying on a passenger plane from from East Asia, but</p>
<p>to the United States, there&rsquo;s probably a whole bunch of stuff</p>
<p>down in that belly. And those are grounded. So the supply of</p>
<p>why are they grounded? Nobody&rsquo;s flying to China right now.</p>
<p>Oh, I see. So now we&rsquo;re seeing kind of the backlog play into</p>
<p>commodity cycles, right, Ryan. So we&rsquo;re seeing like a lot of</p>
<p>these commodities because of these discontinuities in the</p>
<p>supply chains. Suddenly, commodity prices are spiking</p>
<p>all over the place. And I mean, do we think that that settles</p>
<p>down? Or do you think it kind of continues for, you know, the</p>
<p>foreseeable future until this all works its way out?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not the right person to ask about commodity prices.</p>
<p>Maybe Chamath has a view on that. But I, you know, on the</p>
<p>logistics market, I don&rsquo;t see it sorting itself out for the</p>
<p>next year, the next couple of years.</p>
<p>In fact, you&rsquo;ve you&rsquo;ve warned that it might get worse, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve I mean, I saw in Bloomberg, you said that there</p>
<p>could be a union strike in maybe October. What are the</p>
<p>prospects for that? And what happens if that takes place?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s on July 1st. The West Coast Union, it&rsquo;s called the</p>
<p>ILWU. That union extends from the southern border. So from</p>
<p>Mexico all the way to Alaska, and it includes Canada. So the</p>
<p>whole West Coast of the United States is run by this one union</p>
<p>at the ports. And their contract expires on July 1st. And in</p>
<p>years past, so the last time this happened was in 2015. This</p>
<p>is a contract that was signed then and extended at some point.</p>
<p>But in 2015, I had a three month period where nobody could</p>
<p>import anything on the West Coast. And some major companies</p>
<p>missed Christmas that year. So that&rsquo;s July 1st. Typically,</p>
<p>these, there&rsquo;s kind of slowdowns in the months leading up to</p>
<p>that. And we&rsquo;ve already had slowdowns for a couple of years</p>
<p>with hundreds of ships are now waiting offshore. So yeah, I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t make a prediction.</p>
<p>This is a slowdown, basically a negotiating tactic by the</p>
<p>unions.</p>
<p>In the past, it has been I&rsquo;m not convinced that that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen over the last year versus, you know, they are</p>
<p>there are legitimate problems, staffing, people getting COVID,</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>So is there a role for presidential leadership in</p>
<p>sorting out these union issues, or just sorting out the issues</p>
<p>with the port more generally, or avoiding a strike in July?</p>
<p>I mean, it seems to me that if Biden wants to get reelected,</p>
<p>this inflation supply chain issues are pretty top of mind</p>
<p>and in the news and are going to be on people&rsquo;s, you know, you</p>
<p>want to be seen doing things. And I do think there are things</p>
<p>that can be done. So yeah, there&rsquo;s a role.</p>
<p>And as far as union negotiations, Biden&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>pretty as equipped as any president&rsquo;s ever been to</p>
<p>negotiate with the union and get them to play nice and not</p>
<p>screw up his reelection with a with a strike. He&rsquo;s known as a</p>
<p>union friendly president, and go sit down and do a deal with</p>
<p>them where Trump would probably never be able to do a deal with</p>
<p>the union because they know that they&rsquo;re sort of natural</p>
<p>adversaries. So there&rsquo;s something there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more to be done. And I, you know, I got some</p>
<p>arguments with people that are like, you know, that&rsquo;s not in</p>
<p>the President&rsquo;s power to do such and such. I&rsquo;m like, yeah,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s the President of the United States pick up the phone</p>
<p>like you can do things that aren&rsquo;t legally in your power</p>
<p>just by asking for favors. And other people do them. And</p>
<p>negotiating when unions a good idea, a good example.</p>
<p>Convincing to change the zoning laws in LA, so you can stack</p>
<p>containers higher would be another Yeah, that&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>president of the United States jurisdiction. But if he calls</p>
<p>the mayor of LA or the city council,</p>
<p>can you explain that? So what does that mean?</p>
<p>So in Southern California, you can&rsquo;t stack a container more</p>
<p>than two high in a truck yard, by law. Well, we got no place to</p>
<p>put these containers.</p>
<p>But is that is that a danger issue? Or is that like a site</p>
<p>issue site lines? Like what?</p>
<p>I see a little bit of us. I think there&rsquo;s some safety</p>
<p>issues, although they&rsquo;re stacked six high all over the world. So</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not that legitimate to my in my view.</p>
<p>And in California, it&rsquo;s what four or something</p>
<p>to too high.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too hot. Oh, wow.</p>
<p>At the truck yards at the port, you see them stacked up six</p>
<p>high, but in the truck yards to is the limit. Okay. And so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a it&rsquo;s also an eyesore, especially in California,</p>
<p>containers are a sign of free enterprise. And it&rsquo;s just the</p>
<p>people in California can&rsquo;t stand to see them. Right? They</p>
<p>really just object to the idea of capitalism in their</p>
<p>neighborhoods like that.</p>
<p>But there could be like some kind of temporary waiver that we</p>
<p>do just to get through all of this backlog, which is to say,</p>
<p>okay, let&rsquo;s just ease all of these small little things that</p>
<p>slow the process down just to get all these ships, you know,</p>
<p>unloaded, right? Yeah, off into the world where they need to be.</p>
<p>And then we could revert back to what we are after things, you</p>
<p>know, kind of normalize. Yeah, so we did that. So like, I wrote</p>
<p>about this, this zoning law. And what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening then</p>
<p>is if you can&rsquo;t stack the container three high, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nowhere to put that third container. So you leave it on</p>
<p>the trailer. And now you have one less trailer in rotation</p>
<p>servicing the port to unload. And that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s true across</p>
<p>Southern California right now, there are 1000s of trailers</p>
<p>with containers on them, because they&rsquo;re not allowed to stack</p>
<p>them, they&rsquo;ll get fined if they do. So I tweeted about this. And</p>
<p>the the city of Long Beach actually responded. I tweeted</p>
<p>about it at 6am. By 3pm, the city of Long Beach had changed</p>
<p>the zoning law to allow stacking up to five high, I believe. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>told the fastest response by any government to citizen action,</p>
<p>like ever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible. You must feel great about that.</p>
<p>It was great. But unfortunately, only Long Beach did that LA</p>
<p>never followed through. Other and there&rsquo;s not that many</p>
<p>truckyards in Long Beach. A lot of them are in Los Angeles,</p>
<p>Compton, Rancho Dominguez, etc. So I saw this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, Joe Biden could call these mayors and say, hey,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s work on this, right? Yeah, but let&rsquo;s face it. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super union Joe, right? Like, I mean, he wouldn&rsquo;t even say the</p>
<p>word Tesla over the number, Jason, isn&rsquo;t that more pro union</p>
<p>because won&rsquo;t these won&rsquo;t folks be working more and getting</p>
<p>paid more. And I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a reluctance to pay.</p>
<p>Right? Because clearly, like, you&rsquo;re gonna have to put some</p>
<p>money into the system. And where the money comes from, we can</p>
<p>figure that out later. But the point is that there&rsquo;s a there</p>
<p>should be a desire to actually get the people on the ground to</p>
<p>be working. There wasn&rsquo;t even a third shift shift, Ryan, right?</p>
<p>Like that was another thing you were working on on top of the</p>
<p>stacking of these containers to get, you know, more of these,</p>
<p>you know, to alleviate the problem. You were also talking</p>
<p>about they don&rsquo;t even have a third shift some nights, but</p>
<p>they seem to have added a third shift. Did that become</p>
<p>permanent or not?</p>
<p>No, they do have a third shift, but nobody&rsquo;s showing up is the</p>
<p>problem. So truck drivers don&rsquo;t work in the middle of the night</p>
<p>warehouses aren&rsquo;t open in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>But is that a compensation issue? Right? Like if we paid</p>
<p>more folks show up, like, is that just a supply demand issue</p>
<p>that never underestimate incentives. There&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>a lot of factors and a lot of a lot of it is it&rsquo;s so easy to</p>
<p>point fingers at somebody else and blame someone in the chain,</p>
<p>right supply chain, you&rsquo;ve got all these different people. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s everybody has their own opinion. You know, we at one</p>
<p>point, I wanted to hear what the union&rsquo;s opinion was, what are</p>
<p>they saying? Because everyone else is calling them lazy, and</p>
<p>not working hard, what&rsquo;s really happening. So we I said to taco</p>
<p>truck down to the port a couple of months ago, just because we</p>
<p>figured we&rsquo;re getting free tacos, they&rsquo;ll talk to us. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a game changer right there. Yeah, that really works.</p>
<p>Well, we got, they loved it. These are the only business ever</p>
<p>to send tacos to the port. And then they told us all about what</p>
<p>their viewpoint was, they viewed that the truckers are screwing</p>
<p>up that 50% of all the appointments, where a truck is</p>
<p>supposed to come and pick up a container, they&rsquo;re missing their</p>
<p>appointments, right? And because and then and then so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what sent me investigating, wait, why are</p>
<p>they missing the appointments? That&rsquo;s when I learned, oh, they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have any trailers, these chassis, because they&rsquo;re stuck</p>
<p>under containers and can&rsquo;t be unlocked. So a lot of it is</p>
<p>going here, it&rsquo;s the supply chains kind of like this, that</p>
<p>metaphorical elephant in the dark room, right? And everybody</p>
<p>sees their own aspect of it. But you got to synthesize all those</p>
<p>perspectives and kind of take a systems view and see if you can</p>
<p>get some real understanding. I&rsquo;m not convinced I have it yet. By</p>
<p>the way, I think it is more complex. And I&rsquo;m really beware</p>
<p>simple narratives. If someone, even including me says, Oh, this</p>
<p>is exactly what&rsquo;s happening. Like, there&rsquo;s really a lot of</p>
<p>complexity in all of this, right?</p>
<p>And how much how much of this is sort of the the, the extreme</p>
<p>end of the other spectrum, which is basically the US</p>
<p>exceptionalism view that says, Okay, we just need to really</p>
<p>in house more of the stuff that we need so that we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>actually have to rely on some of these arcane methods of just</p>
<p>transporting goods for, you know, from point A to point B,</p>
<p>in my view, that would be a shame. If we have the best</p>
<p>companies in the world, who need to be able to source raw</p>
<p>materials, components, finished goods, anywhere on planet Earth,</p>
<p>and we should have a modern infrastructure that makes that</p>
<p>possible instead of being like, Oh, we can&rsquo;t trade with the rest</p>
<p>of the world. So we&rsquo;re going to become like, self sufficient,</p>
<p>you know, we might as well go back to everybody being a farmer</p>
<p>on subsistence farmer on our own land. Like, I think we should</p>
<p>have global infrastructure that&rsquo;s really great and</p>
<p>seamless and makes it really easy. But you&rsquo;re right, that</p>
<p>might be an end result is people can&rsquo;t rely on these</p>
<p>supply chains and start saying, Hey, let&rsquo;s manufacture at home</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s manufacture in Latin America. Let&rsquo;s manufacture</p>
<p>closer to home. That to my perspective, that would be a</p>
<p>shame.</p>
<p>Well, I think the I think the prod the pendulum always starts</p>
<p>from one extreme to the other. And I think the the middle</p>
<p>ground is probably that you need to have some heterogeneity,</p>
<p>right? You have to have some amount of it that is not just</p>
<p>singularly reliant on China, maybe it&rsquo;s maybe it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>central or Latin America, right? Some that&rsquo;s domestic,</p>
<p>but that domestic production probably has to be subsidized</p>
<p>by something because we&rsquo;re never going to be able to run as</p>
<p>efficiently and as cost effectively as, you know,</p>
<p>cheaper international labor, you know, unless we invent</p>
<p>something really, you know, incredible. So the balance is</p>
<p>probably in the middle. But it&rsquo;s going to take us a long</p>
<p>time to kind of get there. I think I saw Governor Abbott was</p>
<p>pitching people on, hey, just send your containers to Texas</p>
<p>were cheaper and more central in the country. Is that true? Is</p>
<p>that a solution takes much longer cost much more. When if</p>
<p>the union goes on strike on the west coast, it&rsquo;ll be one of</p>
<p>your only options bringing stuff through the canal. What</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll very quickly see is that the canal is going to back up.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t move that many more ships through the canal that are</p>
<p>currently going to the west coast. So a lot and you&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>that a lot where the bottleneck just moves for a while. Last</p>
<p>summer, the for example, the trains that were going into</p>
<p>Chicago, they were really having a hard time staffing the</p>
<p>railroads out there. And it was taking them a long time to</p>
<p>unload containers at the at the port at the terminals inland in</p>
<p>Chicago. And drivers, a lot of the truck drivers are owner</p>
<p>operators. So these are entrepreneurs are on their own</p>
<p>truck, work for themselves. And they were able pre pandemic to</p>
<p>do three loads per day at the Chicago railheads. Go drop it</p>
<p>off, come back at another one three times. With the delays</p>
<p>and the traffic jams that resulted, they were only able</p>
<p>to do one a day. And so you opt out, because you can go drive</p>
<p>for UPS or FedEx or take your truck and do something else. So</p>
<p>we had this huge reduction in drivers. And that&rsquo;s the kind of</p>
<p>a feedback loop that we should all be really mindful of here,</p>
<p>where a problem begets more problems, and you get these</p>
<p>positive feedback loops in the system, that really vicious</p>
<p>cycles. And so you know, bottlenecks move, and you&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>as soon as they everybody started to ship to Houston,</p>
<p>guess what, Houston port won&rsquo;t be able to handle the volumes</p>
<p>either. It&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s magically better just because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a republican state or something.</p>
<p>Do we need more ports? Or do we just need to run them more</p>
<p>efficiently? And then who determines who runs the port?</p>
<p>Because I know that they I&rsquo;ve seen some tweets of yours where</p>
<p>they license the government, I guess own supports, but they</p>
<p>license it to people to have the franchise there. More ports,</p>
<p>better run ports. And then what&rsquo;s the business model of</p>
<p>ports?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say better run ports is the answer. I don&rsquo;t think we need</p>
<p>more ports. You can&rsquo;t really create ports out of thin air</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only a handful of geographic locations that</p>
<p>actually make sense for a port. And we have, we have great</p>
<p>geography, like the San Francisco Bay, like this is</p>
<p>probably the best natural harbor in the world, or one of</p>
<p>them. And the Oakland port is perfectly fine. It&rsquo;s who owns</p>
<p>it is the city of Oakland, or the city of Long Beach, the</p>
<p>city of LA. So the local cities own the ports in the United</p>
<p>States. That is a difference between United States and</p>
<p>Europe, for example, where they&rsquo;re sort of national</p>
<p>strategic assets, they&rsquo;re still government owned, but it can be</p>
<p>operated as a sort of public good for everybody, instead of</p>
<p>what are the odds, given what&rsquo;s going on in Oakland, that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the big priority of the mayor of Oakland to like, run a better</p>
<p>port, like she&rsquo;s got a lot of other things on her, on her</p>
<p>list. And so that&rsquo;s one problem with our system. And then</p>
<p>second, they do rent it. So the government owns it and then</p>
<p>rents it to a private company that operates it. And then but</p>
<p>those as a condition of renting the port, you must agree to</p>
<p>hire the ILWU. You can&rsquo;t run a non union port in the United</p>
<p>States. Should the government buy the federal government by</p>
<p>the port from Oakland by the port from Long Beach, offer</p>
<p>them some, you know, trillion dollars or billions of dollars</p>
<p>and buy it out from them. It&rsquo;s not a terrible idea. I mean, as</p>
<p>long as you&rsquo;re forcing everyone to use union labor, it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>really like a private sector endeavors. It&rsquo;s like you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>especially with the way that the unions run, so you can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>that much. But like, here&rsquo;s an example where technology could</p>
<p>flex what already made this technology, we could 10x the</p>
<p>throughput of one of these ports overnight, which is today, a</p>
<p>truck driver shows up looking for a specific container. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like, I got this container number. So they have to make an</p>
<p>appointment at that hour. And as I said, they&rsquo;re missing 50% of</p>
<p>their appointments. Well, on the back end inside the port, they</p>
<p>got to go find that container in this in the needle in the hay</p>
<p>stack and make sure it&rsquo;s at the front during that one hour when</p>
<p>the guy shows up for it. And you could we already have this</p>
<p>tech to make it what we call a free flow stack, where you just</p>
<p>have this the truck pulls up and you give them the first the</p>
<p>first container off the line. And then the mobile app tells</p>
<p>them where to take it. And he doesn&rsquo;t have to come for a</p>
<p>specific container. And if you did that, you just be every 30</p>
<p>seconds coming out of here, instead of every 1015 minutes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d easily 10x the throughput. And this is we already have this</p>
<p>tech. So it&rsquo;s a matter of implementation, deployment, and</p>
<p>how do you get around a lot of people that don&rsquo;t really want to</p>
<p>see better running ports. And it&rsquo;s pretty sad to sit where I</p>
<p>sit, they don&rsquo;t benefit from better running ports, although</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the good point. Although at the back end, they they</p>
<p>suffer from higher prices and inefficiency and not getting the</p>
<p>things they want on time.</p>
<p>Well, if you listen to Elon talk about unions, and why Tesla</p>
<p>is not a union shop, it&rsquo;s got nothing to do with wages, you</p>
<p>know, he said, we&rsquo;ll pay you the union rate or better. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not about mistreatment, because he said, Listen, if someone</p>
<p>mistreats you, we&rsquo;re gonna have a no assholes rule, and we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get rid of them. The issue is inflexibility, right? He wants</p>
<p>to drive continuous process improvement at Tesla. And he</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t do that with a union shop, because every change has to be</p>
<p>negotiated. And then if there is a worker who&rsquo;s not living up to</p>
<p>the performance bar, you can&rsquo;t get rid of them. And they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>repurpose workers and have them work a different line. So that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why Elon has always resisted being a union shop, not the</p>
<p>wages, not mistreatment, purely inflexibility. And it seems like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re seeing in the ports as well is we can&rsquo;t drive</p>
<p>changes and improvements, because everything&rsquo;s so highly</p>
<p>contractually negotiated. That&rsquo;s my comment, Ryan, what do you</p>
<p>think about that?</p>
<p>No, I mean, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s worth studying a little history</p>
<p>here is that, like, you know, we went through the container</p>
<p>revolution in the 60s and 70s, and the union agreed to it. And</p>
<p>they that dramatically transformed the waterfront of</p>
<p>these guys, like, you see the photographs from that era, they</p>
<p>would put it on their back, like burlap sacks full of stuff, like</p>
<p>hauling it on and off these, these ships, and the kind of</p>
<p>load them by hand, it was a real art. And it was a massive</p>
<p>employment driver. And by the way, we&rsquo;ve still barely</p>
<p>recovered from this, like the West Side Highway in New York is</p>
<p>finally like a nice park. But it sat there for 50 years, like</p>
<p>dilapidated piers and ugly ass buildings. And some of those</p>
<p>are still there. San Francisco waterfront still mostly like</p>
<p>that south of the Bay Bridge, it&rsquo;s still like these old</p>
<p>dilapidated buildings. So it&rsquo;s kind of funny to see how long it</p>
<p>takes like that infrastructure to change. But there was, and I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m not like the world&rsquo;s expert on this history.</p>
<p>But somehow they convinced the union to adopt containerization,</p>
<p>which is about, it&rsquo;s far more radical than anything we would</p>
<p>be proposing now, in how you would change their workflow, or</p>
<p>change their work. Like that was complete change, where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really these giant automated, or these giant cranes that replace</p>
<p>the worker.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t Biden deploy his commerce secretary? Or I mean,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t there some cabinet official he could deputize to</p>
<p>say, go solve this problem, go bring the parties together?</p>
<p>Yeah. And I think I suspect that&rsquo;ll happen over the coming</p>
<p>months, because July 1, is pretty bad timing for a</p>
<p>midterm election if they were to go on strike. And I think</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a lot of incentive to make sure that he does have the</p>
<p>incentive. It just seems like I mean, you&rsquo;ve been tweeting about</p>
<p>this for months, that nobody&rsquo;s paying attention in the</p>
<p>administration. I mean, we&rsquo;ve all been reading your tweet</p>
<p>storm saying like someone in Washington really should be</p>
<p>paying attention to these ideas over two administrations now,</p>
<p>right, right. It&rsquo;s both administrations have been out to</p>
<p>lunch on this.</p>
<p>The union is a really big issue that&rsquo;s going to come up this</p>
<p>summer. There&rsquo;s in my view, an even bigger issue that&rsquo;s gotten</p>
<p>even less attention, which is on January 1 of next year,</p>
<p>January 1 2023, which is tomorrow in shipping terms, that</p>
<p>all the ships in the world will have to reduce their carbon</p>
<p>emissions by 13%. And these are internal combustion engine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not right, right, right. Hold on a second. Wait, just</p>
<p>explain what that means. But who&rsquo;s mandating that? And how is</p>
<p>that enforceable? And why is that have to?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the International Maritime Organization. It&rsquo;s part of the</p>
<p>United Nations. And it&rsquo;s the group that is overseeing global</p>
<p>ocean freight. It&rsquo;s the regulatory body for ocean freight</p>
<p>in the world. And it&rsquo;s the United Nations group. So any</p>
<p>member state of the United Nations must follow the rules of</p>
<p>the IMO. And they&rsquo;ve all said they will. And so the IMO has</p>
<p>said, all existing ships in the world must reduce their carbon</p>
<p>emissions by 13%. And again, it&rsquo;s an internal combustion</p>
<p>engine, we don&rsquo;t know how to make it 13% more carbon</p>
<p>efficient, or we would have done that already.</p>
<p>Can you actually buy indirect offsets? Like, can you go and</p>
<p>buy some Amazonian rainforest credits and offset the</p>
<p>No, you can&rsquo;t offset it. And it&rsquo;s not about the fleet either.</p>
<p>So some of these fleets have LNG, liquid natural gas. So the</p>
<p>fleet might be more efficient, but it&rsquo;s no it&rsquo;s down to the</p>
<p>individual ship. And it has to. So there is one way to reduce</p>
<p>the emissions of a ship. And that&rsquo;s to go slower. And if you</p>
<p>go 30% slower, then you can achieve a 13% reduction in</p>
<p>reduction in carbon emissions. Well, if you look at it on a per</p>
<p>container basis, by the way, it&rsquo;s the same amount of carbon</p>
<p>emitted because the ship is still carrying the same number</p>
<p>of containers just go slower. But it will reduce the supply of</p>
<p>shipping capacity and slow everything down another 30%.</p>
<p>That that takes place January 1 2023. It&rsquo;s getting very little</p>
<p>attention. But to my view, it&rsquo;s going to be massively disrupted</p>
<p>if we slow everything down, reduce the capacity of the</p>
<p>network that much further prices are going to go to the moon.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like really asinine law because it doesn&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>achieve any carbon reduction. The fuel type correct me if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>wrong. Is this like MGO MDO? Like it&rsquo;s dirtier fuel? Is that</p>
<p>correct? So the same group IMO actually passed a new logic</p>
<p>January 1 of 2020. And it got totally it was supposed to be a</p>
<p>huge deal in our industry and then COVID hit and we all kind</p>
<p>of ignored it. But that eliminated the worst kinds of</p>
<p>fuel. sulfur used to be you could have this bunker fuel that</p>
<p>was up to 3% sulfur, she led to crazy amounts of sulfuric acid,</p>
<p>which is like apparently like 15 times worse than carbon as a</p>
<p>greenhouse gas. And so that was eliminated. And now it&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>kind of ugly bunker fuel, but it&rsquo;s not like it used to be the</p>
<p>reputation is probably still carried over from from pre 2020.</p>
<p>If you could wave your magic wand as we wrap up here and</p>
<p>change two or three things that to you seem like layups, and I</p>
<p>think you kind of hinted at them in order, what would be the</p>
<p>changes just based on your intuition and your knowledge of</p>
<p>the supply chain? What two or three things are the layups we</p>
<p>got to do right now?</p>
<p>I think first off, it&rsquo;s got to start with some with metrics</p>
<p>like what, if you care about something, measure it, the</p>
<p>metric that the government&rsquo;s been using for ocean freight</p>
<p>delays has been how many ships are waiting offshore at the port</p>
<p>of Long Beach. And this is like one of the most mischievous, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if it was just like outright fraud or incompetence.</p>
<p>But one of the worst things I&rsquo;ve seen from government in terms</p>
<p>of PR is they they pass this rule that the ships have to</p>
<p>wait 150 miles offshore, so that the carbon so that the</p>
<p>pollution wouldn&rsquo;t hit LA like reasonable good. But then they</p>
<p>kept using the same metric for how many ships are waiting right</p>
<p>outside the port. And it went way down and they started</p>
<p>celebrating that success. So like, let&rsquo;s actually use the</p>
<p>right metric, which is how long is it taking cargo to transport</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just hide the ships and celebrate that there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>ships there. If we get the government,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying that the government pushed the ships</p>
<p>beyond the measurement window and then said they don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Yes, basically, the transportation secretary and</p>
<p>the port of LA director got up there. This government</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like when I went to an XL sweater to hide my gut. And I</p>
<p>was like, I&rsquo;m thin. Yeah, look, better to look at the scale.</p>
<p>So if we at least get them focused on the right metric,</p>
<p>which I think we have the best metric right now, we call it the</p>
<p>flexport ocean timeliness indicator. It&rsquo;s how long is it</p>
<p>taking the cargo to from when the factory says it&rsquo;s ready to</p>
<p>when it can be delivered. Now, any solution that we create,</p>
<p>we have a metric, we know, okay, there&rsquo;s a KPI here door</p>
<p>door. Yeah, door to door.</p>
<p>You mentioned the transportation secretary was part of that press</p>
<p>conference where they&rsquo;re taking credit for changing the metric.</p>
<p>So I assume that&rsquo;s Buddha judge who&rsquo;s in charge of dispersing</p>
<p>the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill. Is there any money in the</p>
<p>infrastructure bill to solve this problem?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s $17 billion allocated to ports. I went and</p>
<p>read it and I couldn&rsquo;t find any money that was going to be</p>
<p>spent on building ports. It was like, study, here&rsquo;s a crazy</p>
<p>thing. We just had this trillion dollar infrastructure bill</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s supposed to modernize and update the infrastructure of</p>
<p>the country. And it&rsquo;s doing nothing to solve the most</p>
<p>pressing supply chain issue in the country, which the bottleneck</p>
<p>at the ports, which is driving inflation, which is causing</p>
<p>interest rate increases and wrecking the economy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a term in Washington, which is called the Christmas</p>
<p>tree bill. And the infrastructure bill is an example</p>
<p>of that, which is this is not a directed shot on goal. What this</p>
<p>is, is a random, you know, tree that you go and hang little</p>
<p>things on top of and eventually the whole thing is covered. So</p>
<p>it kind of looks beautiful from afar. But when you get really</p>
<p>close to it, it&rsquo;s a little bit chaotic and you don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on. And so to your point, the fact that Ryan can</p>
<p>say there&rsquo;s $17 billion allocated to something like</p>
<p>ports, but it&rsquo;s unclear to him who&rsquo;s an expert in the space</p>
<p>where that money goes and how it&rsquo;s spent gives us zero chance</p>
<p>of figuring this out.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, it was like, it&rsquo;s like things like, oh, each state</p>
<p>must create our supply chain readiness report about is like,</p>
<p>what, what are you talking about? Like, Singapore put $20</p>
<p>billion to build a badass automated port. Like, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a reasonable thing to do. Like, let&rsquo;s spend $20 billion</p>
<p>to make the most automated, amazing port in the world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be a good use of government money, but like to</p>
<p>then create studies and consultants, I don&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>any of it&rsquo;s going to hit the ground and shovel.</p>
<p>Right. So you&rsquo;re saying you&rsquo;re saying that $17 billion that</p>
<p>goes to, you know, studies and consultants could actually get</p>
<p>redirected and we could pick a port where there&rsquo;s an amenable</p>
<p>city and actually completely modernize it to set the example</p>
<p>of what modern shipping should look like in the United States</p>
<p>that at a minimum matches what&rsquo;s happening in the rest of</p>
<p>the world.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;d be pretty awesome. And doesn&rsquo;t seem to me</p>
<p>like science fiction, like when government wants to build a</p>
<p>port, who&rsquo;s going to stop the government?</p>
<p>That seems too, too logical and too obvious, right?</p>
<p>Well, I could have something else compete for who gets to get</p>
<p>that $20 billion to be the modernized port, like,</p>
<p>Well, if you put it to your point, Jason, put the put the</p>
<p>mayors in competition and see which mayor wants us in their</p>
<p>backyard. Does Greg Abbott want it? Does Long Beach want it?</p>
<p>Does Oakland want it? Who wants to fight to be the most modern</p>
<p>port that should be?</p>
<p>DeSantis wants it. I&rsquo;ll tell you that.</p>
<p>DeSantis, Miami. Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure DeSantis and Greg Abbott want it. I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that California&rsquo;s two incredible ports want it. And those are</p>
<p>the two that are closest to China, by the way, spoiler</p>
<p>alert.</p>
<p>You guys remember when Google Fiber ran that competition and</p>
<p>they got, like, the mayor of Pittsburgh to swim in, like, a</p>
<p>frozen lake. And it was awesome, right?</p>
<p>Like, government, yeah, please bring us stuff.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I think I don&rsquo;t have a lot of faith. Even if that</p>
<p>came around, it would take five, six years, right? Even if it</p>
<p>was done right, you don&rsquo;t get a port overnight.</p>
<p>There are some very simple solutions like this, changing</p>
<p>the zoning law, adopting technology to go with a free</p>
<p>flow out of the port, put some metrics in here, like, have</p>
<p>someone focus on this.</p>
<p>A key part of problem solving is make sure the problem doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get worse. So let&rsquo;s assign someone to go work with the</p>
<p>union and the and the company terminal operators, make sure</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t go on strike and make sure and then someone</p>
<p>needs to go look at this IMO, UN thing and figure out if the</p>
<p>United States is really going to go through with that because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty crazy.</p>
<p>Well, listen, Ryan, you&rsquo;ve been incredibly generous with your</p>
<p>time and knowledge and your leadership watching you as, you</p>
<p>know, a CEO and a leader go out there on a boat and go visit</p>
<p>and buy the frickin tacos and actually boots on the ground</p>
<p>figure this out. Like the country owes you a debt, the</p>
<p>world owes you a debt to really keep this, you know, problem</p>
<p>down to first principles and figure it out. And our</p>
<p>government should be taking notes and really the other</p>
<p>leaders who are importing whether it&rsquo;s Apple or Tesla, you</p>
<p>know, it&rsquo;d be great for all of them to be supporting you. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;ve reached out, but maybe the you know, a</p>
<p>half dozen of you can then sit with this administration and the</p>
<p>next one and just tell them where to point the money cannon.</p>
<p>Well, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like they know where to point it.</p>
<p>We have a lot of people in Washington that listen to this</p>
<p>pod, please. Yes. Just reach out to Ryan and just reach out</p>
<p>to Ryan and have lunch and just sit there and please just goes</p>
<p>for these. Let Ryan buy you a taco guys. Ryan, bring your</p>
<p>taco truck to Washington. One of the big common denominators</p>
<p>of both business and politics is that leaders have to focus on</p>
<p>the right problems. And when they&rsquo;re not focused on the right</p>
<p>problems, like bad things happen. And, you know, we know</p>
<p>that inflation is a huge problem. The Fed now is raising</p>
<p>rates are projecting raising rates very quickly, which is</p>
<p>creating, it was created a huge market downturn, it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>blunt instrument, it could cause a downturn or recession. So</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the big problem. And yet there are specific solutions and</p>
<p>fixes to the inflation problem by updating or modernizing the</p>
<p>ports that Ryan suggested, but who&rsquo;s focusing on it. And now</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be more strategic, right? sacks, it&rsquo;d be a more</p>
<p>strategic sniper shot, as opposed to this blunt</p>
<p>instrument, like, right, exactly. So, you know, and so</p>
<p>what have they been focusing in Washington on? Definitely not</p>
<p>this, you know, absolutely. And then I see Ryan posting</p>
<p>suggestions on Twitter, and then all these people come in,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all like fatalistic. Oh, well, the President can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>anything. You know, the President can emergency war</p>
<p>time. If there was ever a time for presidential leadership,</p>
<p>this would be it. What I worry about is that if you&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>union leader, and you know that you&rsquo;ve got Biden in the White</p>
<p>House, who&rsquo;s always going to take their side? Why wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you make your demands more unreasonable? Yeah, they should</p>
<p>be asking for triple time to keep it open overnight. Why</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t they? Do you really if you&rsquo;re the leader of that</p>
<p>union? Biden&rsquo;s gonna break your strike? No way. No way.</p>
<p>Ask for quadruple time. Yeah, just make it painful. You</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t make the most of the crisis. egregious as possible.</p>
<p>I mean, this is your max leverage right now. Max</p>
<p>leverage. Never waste a crisis. Yeah, this is your time. All</p>
<p>right, man. Listen, right. Thanks a lot. Great. Thanks,</p>
<p>my pleasure. I&rsquo;m a big fan of the show. So being a guest he</p>
<p>means a lot to me. So thanks. Yeah. And we&rsquo;ll continue the</p>
<p>discussion perhaps at the all in summit in May. Exactly. See</p>
<p>you in Miami. Facebook stock has dropped over 25% after</p>
<p>reporting negative user growth for the first time and not only</p>
<p>$10 billion or maybe even $12 billion lost a year on their</p>
<p>AR VR headsets and project, but also a $10 billion decrease in</p>
<p>projected 2022 revenue thanks to Apple&rsquo;s privacy features. I</p>
<p>guess we got to go to PayPal drop 25% to Yeah, we have to pay</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;ll and then Snapchat had a whipsaw back and forth. But</p>
<p>Chamath when you see this, you call this with your spread</p>
<p>trade. Maybe you could walk us through what you saw, you know,</p>
<p>whatever it was three, four or five months ago. And then what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re seeing now and at this level with $250 billion wiped</p>
<p>off the market cap, what do you what do you think about the</p>
<p>future of this as a trade and as a company? Well, I think the</p>
<p>trade did what it was supposed to do, which is in a period of</p>
<p>a lot of volatility, I saw an opportunity to, you know, just</p>
<p>reduce my risk exposure. Look, I&rsquo;m generally long, very risky</p>
<p>assets, right? I mean, all of us are in the business of building</p>
<p>companies that have huge volatility, because all of our</p>
<p>companies generate earnings very far in the future. And so,</p>
<p>you know, in November of last year, I was trying to figure</p>
<p>out what I could do to shield myself. And the reason I wanted</p>
<p>to shield myself was because I saw Elon and Jeff in part</p>
<p>selling, but also I saw that clearly, we were going to go</p>
<p>through a period where that high growth tech was going to</p>
<p>trade down. So I sold some of that high growth tech. But then</p>
<p>I also wanted to figure out a way where I could be less</p>
<p>exposed to some of that volatility by continuing to</p>
<p>hold what I had. And the best way that I figured out how to</p>
<p>do that was to do the spread trade. And so, you know, what I</p>
<p>saw at the time was that there is one business above all</p>
<p>others that I think is immune amongst big tech, from any sort</p>
<p>of real long term issues. And that&rsquo;s Microsoft. And I think</p>
<p>David expressed the reason well, is that it&rsquo;s an enterprise</p>
<p>business. Now, you know, politicians generally don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>tend to care about enterprise businesses, they have enormous</p>
<p>longitudinal growth in front of them. And they&rsquo;re able to do</p>
<p>things on the margins, specifically around M&amp;A to keep</p>
<p>building their business with very little oversight. And we</p>
<p>saw this because they had the courage to do this Activision</p>
<p>deal. You know, just a few weeks ago, if you could imagine</p>
<p>again, no other company in big tech could even dare try to do a</p>
<p>$70 billion acquisition because of the scrutiny.</p>
<p>In this climate, it was a bold move. Yes. Yeah.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not a bold move. I actually think it says the</p>
<p>obvious, which is Microsoft is beyond the level of regulatory</p>
<p>scrutiny that the rest of big tech actually has, because they</p>
<p>are consumer businesses. The second safest company is Google.</p>
<p>And the reason is that Google has the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both a platform because of Android. But then where they</p>
<p>are at risk of being an app, they have an incredible deal</p>
<p>with Apple that blunts that effect. And so when Apple talks</p>
<p>about all their push to privacy, you still have this very</p>
<p>specific relationship and Facebook called it out in their</p>
<p>earnings release, they said, we believe that Google has</p>
<p>preferential treatment relative to the rest of the internet in</p>
<p>that Apple deal because they pay Apple 15 or $20 billion a year.</p>
<p>And for people who don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s for search, the default</p>
<p>search on your iPhone goes to Google, Google pays $15 billion</p>
<p>to Apple. And the accusation explain the accusation there of</p>
<p>why that would give them preferential in case people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re paying somebody 15 or $20 billion a</p>
<p>year, they&rsquo;re less likely to do bad things to you, they may do</p>
<p>bad things to other people, but they&rsquo;re not going to do as many</p>
<p>bad things to you. Did you believe that? Yeah, that</p>
<p>allegation from Zack? Yeah. Well, no, I don&rsquo;t believe the</p>
<p>allegation. But I think that general character, that general</p>
<p>thing is true. Like you&rsquo;re not going to screw over your</p>
<p>partners, you&rsquo;re going to screw over other people before you</p>
<p>screw over your partners. Got it. Whether this applies here,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll have to be borne out in some kind of lawsuit or state</p>
<p>AGs or blah, blah, blah. But anyways, the I think the point</p>
<p>is that every other company has a lot more headwinds than</p>
<p>Microsoft and Google and big tech. And then the third thing</p>
<p>is was a market observation from Gavin Baker, which I thought</p>
<p>was incredibly brilliant. And what he said was, when you see a</p>
<p>drawdown, meaning when the markets go down, it&rsquo;ll affect</p>
<p>high growth tech first. It ended up touching a bunch of</p>
<p>other areas second, like biotech. But he said this key</p>
<p>thing, which is big tech will be the last to crack. But when</p>
<p>they do, they are going to get shot. And so I spent a bunch of</p>
<p>time just trying to figure out when big tech gets cracked,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s going to get cracked the hardest. And I just kind of</p>
<p>wanted to create a spread between those who were the most</p>
<p>inoculated to those that were the most at risk. As it turned</p>
<p>out, Netflix puked it up, Facebook puked it up. Amazon</p>
<p>actually got really crushed, even though this past day, they</p>
<p>had a pretty decent rally because of their earnings, but</p>
<p>they really got crushed. So in any event, the trade is what the</p>
<p>trade is, the bigger thing is what is going on at Facebook.</p>
<p>And I think what you see are three really important headwinds</p>
<p>that Facebook called out explicitly. One is that when</p>
<p>they talked about usage, kind of flattening, and starting to</p>
<p>decay, what they&rsquo;re really talking about is tick tock. And</p>
<p>I think what we learned is that tick tock is an enormous threat</p>
<p>and a huge competitive force now in the consumer social app</p>
<p>ecosystem. The second is that Facebook is fundamentally an app</p>
<p>that sits inside of an ecosystem that is subject to the rules of</p>
<p>the platform owner. And that&rsquo;s Apple and Google. And so this</p>
<p>IDFA change, so the change in how you can track advertisers,</p>
<p>Facebook said is going to have a $10 billion impact in 2022.</p>
<p>And then the third thing, which was more implicit, is in order</p>
<p>for them to grow, if you can&rsquo;t grow organically, the only other</p>
<p>way to grow is inorganically. And unfortunately, as we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>seeing, the regulatory focus on this company is really enormous.</p>
<p>And so it was a, you know, it was a pretty watershed moment in</p>
<p>I think that company&rsquo;s discussion of their future. And</p>
<p>Mark actually kind of said that as much in the in the press in</p>
<p>the sacks, you look at this business, you made a interesting</p>
<p>observation, Facebook rebranding itself as meta before meta</p>
<p>exists, it may be looked at as another sort of sign that maybe</p>
<p>they got a little tilted, maybe what we should take on the sort</p>
<p>of changing the name of the company before that business</p>
<p>really is at scale or exists.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s a bubble move. Because look, when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in an up market, and the market is super frothy, we had in</p>
<p>hindsight, last year was a giant asset bubble funded by all this</p>
<p>liquidity coming out of the Fed and the federal government. So</p>
<p>yeah, in a bubble like that, all investors care about is the</p>
<p>growth story. And so Facebook went all in on the story around</p>
<p>metaverse. But in the cold light of day, you know, once the</p>
<p>once the sun came up, yeah, once the punchbowl has been taken</p>
<p>away, and you&rsquo;re in the hangover, and you&rsquo;re in sort of a</p>
<p>very volatile, potentially packed it in bear market,</p>
<p>investors go, wait a second, you know, this VR division is</p>
<p>losing 10 billion a year.</p>
<p>It might even be 12, by the way, because they said it was a</p>
<p>little higher. So</p>
<p>they lost 6 billion last year, they lost 10 billion this year.</p>
<p>So the losses are escalating. And so in that kind of market,</p>
<p>investors are like, wait a second, do I do I want to invest</p>
<p>in a company that whose future is that unclear? I mean, if you</p>
<p>look at this, at this market, we&rsquo;ve seen that the growth</p>
<p>stocks are down 60. Today&rsquo;s an update yesterday was a horrible</p>
<p>day. So they&rsquo;re bouncing around 60 70% down off the highs in</p>
<p>early November, okay, but the fangs are only down like 14%,</p>
<p>or something like that, right. But Facebook basically took</p>
<p>themselves out of the the sort of the market leader bucket and</p>
<p>put themselves in the growth bucket.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re like, treat us like Peloton. We&rsquo;re speculative.</p>
<p>Why would why would they want to do that? You know, it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>terrible strategic decision, you&rsquo;re saying?</p>
<p>Well, it was a it was a decision. It was the kind of</p>
<p>decision where you look back with 2020 hindsight, and you</p>
<p>say, look, that kind of decision could only be made in a bubbly,</p>
<p>frothy market, you would never make that decision in the kind</p>
<p>of down market you have today and other decisions look stupid</p>
<p>as well. So PayPal was just down 25%. Okay, why was it down?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, they just, well, no growth and users. It was mostly</p>
<p>on the forecast. And yeah, they revised their forecast down</p>
<p>considerably. And of course, they tried to blame it on the</p>
<p>economy. But other companies, you know, Amazon just had a huge</p>
<p>beat relative expectations. Yeah, they&rsquo;re up 15% today. So</p>
<p>not everybody is blaming the macroeconomic picture of the way</p>
<p>that PayPal did any event. My point is, you go back six months</p>
<p>ago. And you know, what was PayPal doing? I wrote a story</p>
<p>for Barry Weiss, for her sub stack about how PayPal was</p>
<p>taking the lead in financial de-platforming. They were</p>
<p>working with the ADL and the SPLC to kick to identify groups</p>
<p>to kick off their platform. So that&rsquo;s what management was</p>
<p>spending their cycles on figuring out how not to grow</p>
<p>how to kick people off their platform and trying to figure</p>
<p>out how to get more people on it.</p>
<p>Sounds familiar. Who else is trying to</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the kind of thing you do, when you&rsquo;re in a frothy market</p>
<p>and your stock is up and you&rsquo;re trying to find, you can waste</p>
<p>your management cycles on stuff like that. Now their stock is</p>
<p>down 25%. You have to wonder, gee, do we wish we had spent our</p>
<p>time on other things?</p>
<p>Okay, so Friedberg, I have a question for you about the</p>
<p>future. Obviously, Facebook has bet the farm on meta, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>betting on VR. And I guess eventually AR or what</p>
<p>collectively is called XR. And then we have news that Apple has</p>
<p>a seemingly brilliant goggles product coming out, developers</p>
<p>are getting into it, and they are the masters of hardware. So</p>
<p>now, Zuckerberg has decided he will be on a collision course</p>
<p>with a company that just took $10 billion in revenue from them</p>
<p>by doing the non tracking. And that is the masters of hardware.</p>
<p>So we have this collision course coming. And then just two weeks</p>
<p>ago, Google said, Hey, by the way, remember that Google Glass</p>
<p>thing? We&rsquo;re not giving up on VR, AR either. And of course,</p>
<p>Microsoft, we all know, has their HoloLens. So when we look</p>
<p>at that four horse race, if you were to bet and rank who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to win, Apple, goggles, Google Glass, whatever they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to call the new thing, HoloLens and Metas Oculus, who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to win? And what do you how do you look at that</p>
<p>competition between the big four?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a race you want to be in.</p>
<p>So I like that answer. Race to nowhere.</p>
<p>Have you guys used the Oculus Quest device?</p>
<p>Absolutely. I have two of them. Try. Oh, my.</p>
<p>Have you played the games where you like move continuously</p>
<p>through space? And like, when you do that, it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna throw up, you&rsquo;re gonna throw up. I mean, I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>that this notion that that becomes the new computing</p>
<p>modality is like a fair and true notion. And so, you know,</p>
<p>there may it may end up becoming kind of a niche entertainment</p>
<p>device, almost like a Nintendo Switch where there&rsquo;s a, you</p>
<p>know, a mode when you&rsquo;re using it, but I&rsquo;m not sure it</p>
<p>replaces traditional static two dimensional computing in front</p>
<p>of you. The jury&rsquo;s still out. I don&rsquo;t see like a computer</p>
<p>sentiment that says these things will ultimately kind of</p>
<p>prevail over the current mode. So, you know, if it does work,</p>
<p>who would win? In your mind, who&rsquo;s got the best chance? Well,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s assume we&rsquo;re all going to use it every day for two hours</p>
<p>as our desktop, we&rsquo;re going to put it on, we&rsquo;re going to find</p>
<p>workout apps to use whatever it&rsquo;s going to become. Let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s assume, you know, that I think you just answered your</p>
<p>own question in, in, in all of these things, when you build</p>
<p>hardware, I think you can take a lot of parallels from what</p>
<p>happened in the PC space. If you have commoditized PC</p>
<p>manufacturers, compact, Dell, IBM, right, their innumerable</p>
<p>number 1000s of companies that made PCs, the value created to</p>
<p>the application layer to the operating system, and the people</p>
<p>that can actually build ecosystems are typically the</p>
<p>ones that win. And the people that already have an ecosystem</p>
<p>and all they have to do is port somebody from, you know,</p>
<p>platform A to platform B has a meaningful advantage over</p>
<p>somebody that has to convince you to come to a new platform</p>
<p>altogether. And so, you know, if you&rsquo;re a Microsoft, and you</p>
<p>have 1000s or 100s of 1000s of developers, or if you&rsquo;re Google,</p>
<p>and you have 100s of 1000s of developers, or if you&rsquo;re Apple,</p>
<p>and you have millions of developers, it&rsquo;s just a smaller</p>
<p>bridge to cross in order to convince them to that for one</p>
<p>extra endpoint, iOS versus Android, you know, versus</p>
<p>Microsoft. And by the way, it seems like the obvious</p>
<p>transition, whereas like Facebook is like, you got to go</p>
<p>build all this stuff. And Apple made an incredibly important</p>
<p>set of decisions a few years ago, which I didn&rsquo;t think a lot</p>
<p>of people talked about, but they had an OS tree that was</p>
<p>branching far too widely, right? They had a different</p>
<p>operating system for the phones, they had a different</p>
<p>operating system for iPads, desktop for watches, and they</p>
<p>started to try to converge and shoehorn these things into into</p>
<p>a set of basic primitives, so that it&rsquo;s more controllable. And</p>
<p>I suspect the reason is because that gives them more</p>
<p>optionality to go into a car to go into a headset, without</p>
<p>having to do an entire developer, even better than that</p>
<p>Chamath is a great point you bring up, because they also</p>
<p>started investing in their own chipset. And I think all of</p>
<p>that chipset innovation gives them a dramatic advantage in</p>
<p>having smaller batteries and more processing power in a</p>
<p>headset if it does work, which what chips does what chip asset</p>
<p>does Facebook have none. So I don&rsquo;t want to I don&rsquo;t think we</p>
<p>should say that Facebook is down or not. But let&rsquo;s just qualify</p>
<p>what we think can win. So that&rsquo;s one thing. The other thing to</p>
<p>remember is when you look at the PC industry, how did Intel</p>
<p>become so dominant part of what Intel was able to do to out</p>
<p>compete AMD and everybody else was that program called Intel</p>
<p>inside, which is effectively these co marketing pass through</p>
<p>dollars that they would use to actually give an incentive for</p>
<p>Dell and for compact and for all these other folks to</p>
<p>basically build the spec. And that was the Wintel monopoly,</p>
<p>right, Microsoft and Intel. If you play that out in VR, what</p>
<p>you really need is just a bag full of cash. Because if you</p>
<p>give developers a subsidized incentive to build for your</p>
<p>platform, they&rsquo;ll do it. So then, again, if you rank the</p>
<p>companies, you just need to look at how much cash do they have,</p>
<p>because those with the most cash. So again, I think the best</p>
<p>way to think about this is how many developers do you have</p>
<p>today? How much cash do you have today? How much cash will</p>
<p>you have in the future? And you can probably rank and just do a</p>
<p>reasonable expected value to think about who has the best</p>
<p>chance of winning assuming the platform is roughly equal. Now,</p>
<p>if the if the if the if the company on that list with the</p>
<p>fewest developers and the least money has a superior device, if</p>
<p>that device is superior enough, they can overcome those things,</p>
<p>right? And Facebook has the least money and Facebook has the</p>
<p>least if you have rough parity. I think the person with the</p>
<p>most money and the most developers probably has the</p>
<p>best chance of winning sacks. Facebook has the least</p>
<p>developers, they have no relationship with developers. In</p>
<p>fact, they kind of screwed them over with Facebook Connect a</p>
<p>couple times they have the least money, but they do have the</p>
<p>largest user base of profiles. So does that give them some</p>
<p>advantage here? And how would you rank who&rsquo;s going to win</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s going to lose? Well, I think it gives them an</p>
<p>advantage and Tomas framework of porting over their app onto</p>
<p>whatever the you know, dominant platform is going to be but</p>
<p>probably it&rsquo;s the operating system players who are probably</p>
<p>gonna be able to extend their operating system into this new,</p>
<p>you know, VR, AR world, probably. What I wonder about</p>
<p>is, would Facebook have been better off if they were going to</p>
<p>run a $10 billion a year money losing division that&rsquo;s highly</p>
<p>speculative? Would they have been better off gambling that on</p>
<p>building their own phone, or maybe their own like forked</p>
<p>version of an Android phone with and the reason why I say</p>
<p>that is project that I started, I was about to say. We&rsquo;ve now</p>
<p>seen we&rsquo;ve now seen let&rsquo;s not redig that. Well, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>losing, they&rsquo;re losing 10 billion a year now, because of</p>
<p>this one permissions change that Apple has made, right,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re completely dependent on Apple&rsquo;s operating</p>
<p>system for a big portion of their revenue. So what is their</p>
<p>defense against that? I mean, they&rsquo;re really pretty helpless.</p>
<p>If you look just to make a comparison, if you look at the</p>
<p>strategic brilliance of Google, what was it first of all, after</p>
<p>they came up with this cash cow, the idea of search, and</p>
<p>then they combined it with the sort of keyword auction they</p>
<p>got from overture, they said that, listen, the next</p>
<p>strategic move is we can&rsquo;t let anybody disintermediate us. So</p>
<p>what do they do, they started moving upstream. The first, the</p>
<p>first sort of upstream player was the portal, right? So they</p>
<p>start competing against Yahoo, they gave away Gmail, then it</p>
<p>was the browser. So it was Microsoft Explorer. So they</p>
<p>gave away Chrome, then it was the operating system, they gave</p>
<p>away Android, they said, we&rsquo;re not going to let anybody else</p>
<p>be upstream of us. And so they started replacing all those</p>
<p>layers of the stack, giving away free products with free, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, sorry, and a good free product.</p>
<p>Yeah, great. I mean, all those have billions of users.</p>
<p>Also say a big part of the monetization lock in was Google</p>
<p>then extended into the publishers very quickly with the</p>
<p>acquisition of AdSense. And the publishers then allowed Google</p>
<p>to offer the greatest CPM that those publishers could have over</p>
<p>any other advertising network. And as a result, Google built</p>
<p>their network and then built their advertiser base. And they</p>
<p>effectively, you know, got this huge lock in. The only</p>
<p>disruptive threat to Google was what Facebook did, which is to</p>
<p>create demographic profiles where instead of targeting ads</p>
<p>based on keyword or search intent, you could now target</p>
<p>ads based on demographic and then Facebook took it a step</p>
<p>further and did retargeting. So basically following you across</p>
<p>multiple sites, but Facebook always knew. And as we just</p>
<p>discovered, that was always going to be a weak point for</p>
<p>them, because they were dependent upon hardware devices</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to let them do that tracking across apps and</p>
<p>across sites. And that&rsquo;s why Google always had this kind of</p>
<p>key, you know, lock in advantage that, you know, will</p>
<p>persist. And the network is just so big on both sides, you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>compete to sacks is thought bomb. If they had invested in a</p>
<p>phone, let&rsquo;s say they made $1,000. Let&rsquo;s say they made a</p>
<p>phone with a bomb of $800. By the way, just remember the fire</p>
<p>TV. And he gave a bunch of great speeches, you can watch</p>
<p>these and what happened with that. And just, you know,</p>
<p>despite his extraordinarily large user base, his committed</p>
<p>loyal users, all these reasons, his magical, talented technical</p>
<p>team, he hired the best people. He also tried to do the same</p>
<p>with search, by the way, with a nine. And remember, Apple also</p>
<p>tried to do the same with search, all these guys tried to</p>
<p>kind of compete. It&rsquo;s not easy to execute. Yeah, it&rsquo;s not easy</p>
<p>to execute. And you get a lock in with the network value. But</p>
<p>you also get a lock in with the talent. And you know, this was a</p>
<p>really hard thing to pull off. And you have to get it all</p>
<p>right. So let me ask him off the question based on what sack</p>
<p>said, could that should they have deployed 10 billion into</p>
<p>phones? If we go back two years, and they did deploy 10</p>
<p>billion into phones, they take an $800 bomb, which is probably</p>
<p>what the best iPhone cost, I think it costs 700 for Apple to</p>
<p>make and they sell it for 1500. They could basically give the</p>
<p>phone away for half price, maybe give it away for four or $500.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what fire phone was. And if they gave away for $400, and</p>
<p>you had to be a Facebook user, you buy it, they get the credit</p>
<p>card of the person that would be they could put 25 million</p>
<p>phones into the market every year. That&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>Amazon thought. And I don&rsquo;t think that moves the needle. So</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think it would work and create a better user</p>
<p>experience for users, users got a better experience with the</p>
<p>iPhone, okay. And then they got a better experience with</p>
<p>Android. The window of time was in 2009 10 and 11, when there</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t lock in. And, you know, I think that&rsquo;s, look, that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>well discussed about what we were doing and what we tried to</p>
<p>do. So there&rsquo;s no point rehashing. But why did Facebook</p>
<p>give that up? Because there wasn&rsquo;t an initiative, right? It</p>
<p>was it wasn&rsquo;t that it was it came down to, you know, an ask</p>
<p>that I made that we didn&rsquo;t get, and it didn&rsquo;t happen. So it</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t happen. We&rsquo;ll leave it at that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that would have been successful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying neither did I, we didn&rsquo;t get to the starting</p>
<p>line. So we&rsquo;ll never know.</p>
<p>In fact, I think it&rsquo;s unlikely that it would have worked,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what Facebook&rsquo;s value prop</p>
<p>would have been. My point is just if you&rsquo;re going to lose $10</p>
<p>billion a year on a division, wouldn&rsquo;t it be better for it to</p>
<p>be something strategically vital, as opposed to something</p>
<p>that feels a little bit optional,</p>
<p>even if the majority chances you don&rsquo;t win? The question is,</p>
<p>if you had a 2030 35% chance of being a player in smartphones,</p>
<p>would you take that chance? And I think you have no choice but</p>
<p>to take that chance that it would be worth it the expected</p>
<p>value.</p>
<p>Yeah, one thing I&rsquo;ll say in defense of Facebook is I think</p>
<p>that all of this like antitrust scrutiny is a little bit</p>
<p>ridiculous today. And it looks pretty ridiculous. And let me</p>
<p>just explain why, like, it seems that capitalism is pretty much</p>
<p>working as intended. Because if you looked at Google&rsquo;s results,</p>
<p>if you looked at snaps results, at Pinterest&rsquo;s results, at</p>
<p>Amazon&rsquo;s results, there is a vibrant and growing advertising</p>
<p>ecosystem, by no means, could you claim that Facebook has any</p>
<p>real monopoly on that number one. And when you fold in TikTok,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s absolutely true. And then if you think about the usage</p>
<p>curve of TikTok, there&rsquo;s a check and balance there on usage.</p>
<p>And so anybody that thinks that Facebook is a monopoly today,</p>
<p>I think is a little misguided. So really, I think what</p>
<p>politicians need to do today, you know, February 4, is be a</p>
<p>little bit more honest about what they really care about,</p>
<p>which is really around section 230. And the misinformation</p>
<p>disinformation fears that they have related to Facebook&rsquo;s</p>
<p>distribution power, because now if you&rsquo;re going to try to</p>
<p>legislate this company, it&rsquo;s really unfair, like, especially</p>
<p>going back 10 years to litigate an acquisition, you&rsquo;d never do</p>
<p>that to any other company that you know, is sort of maybe on</p>
<p>the back half of their growth cycle, it just doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense.</p>
<p>It would be like going after Google now for the YouTube</p>
<p>acquisition is like $31 billion of advertising revenue crazy,</p>
<p>there is a vibrant, diverse advertising ecosystem, Facebook</p>
<p>is not in control of that ecosystem. And so trying to</p>
<p>legislate them as a monopoly in that ecosystem is insane today.</p>
<p>What do you think, Saks? Do you think this regulation is based</p>
<p>on the fact that Facebook kicked off Trump and is scaring</p>
<p>politicians over actual competitive reality?</p>
<p>I think that politicians are using the threat of regulation</p>
<p>to try and drive the, the speech policies they want on these</p>
<p>social networks. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really going on. I mean, the</p>
<p>merits.</p>
<p>So you agree with me, it&rsquo;s nothing to do with the business.</p>
<p>Yeah, look, who should get regulated on antitrust grounds,</p>
<p>Apple, you know, Apple is that maybe Google, I mean, well,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the big monopolists. I mean, they control the</p>
<p>operating system. I mean, those guys percent of search, and I</p>
<p>would say Amazon with respect to the verticals where they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>competing with their own, with the basic exactly. So in other</p>
<p>words, when you control an operating system, and then</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s developers or other, you know, downstream players on</p>
<p>that ecosystem, you have to treat them fairly, you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>privilege your own policy to then dominate vertical after</p>
<p>vertical. So yeah, there are real antitrust concerns with</p>
<p>those three companies, the Facebook way less so. And yet</p>
<p>they get the brunt of the attacks. Why? Because the</p>
<p>people in Washington are trying to coerce Facebook into</p>
<p>controlling what they call misinformation, which is really</p>
<p>just speech they don&rsquo;t like. And that is highly inappropriate.</p>
<p>Perfect segue. Last week, we didn&rsquo;t jump into the Rogan</p>
<p>Spotify debate, maybe we should have. But we&rsquo;ll talk about it</p>
<p>now with a lot more context. Obviously, Neil Young and some</p>
<p>other folks that were pulling our music off, Joni Mitchell,</p>
<p>whatever, some actual high profile blogger said they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to be on there. And then Joe Rogan and Daniel Eck both</p>
<p>decided to talk about this. Joe Rogan said, Listen, I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>comedian, I don&rsquo;t prepare for these interviews. And I just see</p>
<p>where they go. But this show has gotten very influential. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the number one podcast in the world&rsquo;s got a ridiculous</p>
<p>listenership. So maybe I should write about having right now,</p>
<p>maybe I should have it labeled. And his and maybe I should have</p>
<p>people on afterwards. And maybe I should do some extra fact</p>
<p>checking. I thought it was the best nonpology. You know,</p>
<p>explain ology of an apology, because he did say, I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t like it. But he did kind of say that he would do</p>
<p>better. And then Daniel X said, and then I&rsquo;ll let you guys</p>
<p>comment. Daniel, I said, Listen, we produce shows, and we</p>
<p>approve guests for the ringer. And for gimlet, which we own</p>
<p>those studios, we license Joe Rogan, we don&rsquo;t do any editing</p>
<p>on his show. And we will remove ones after the fact, but it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>licensing, they&rsquo;ll therefore we&rsquo;re not a publisher. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>curious what you thought. Friedberg on the nonpology and</p>
<p>culpability for someone like Joe Rogan having guests on who are</p>
<p>anti vax, or, you know, maybe are debatable in terms of</p>
<p>science. Because yeah, he is a comedian. But as he says, like</p>
<p>the show is kind of big now. So maybe I should do a little fact</p>
<p>checking. What do you think he should do when he has scientists</p>
<p>and people and people on I&rsquo;ll make two points. One is I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that journalism is regulated, in the sense that,</p>
<p>you know, we have freedom of speech. So anyone can stand up</p>
<p>and they can say, I have this belief, or I have discovered</p>
<p>this fact. And you may not actually hold that belief. And</p>
<p>that fact may not be true. But you&rsquo;re still allowed to stand up</p>
<p>and say it and you&rsquo;re still allowed to have someone come on</p>
<p>and say it. And so I don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s any disclosure</p>
<p>obligation, he&rsquo;s putting on a show, it&rsquo;s the same as any new</p>
<p>show or entertainment show. I don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s a clear</p>
<p>line or boundary. I mean, what the heck do we do here? We&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>all got opinions, we try and talk about the news, we talk</p>
<p>about our perspectives on the future, you know, what the heck</p>
<p>is it that we&rsquo;re doing here? You know, there&rsquo;s no kind of</p>
<p>clear line there. So I don&rsquo;t think that he has any</p>
<p>obligations to do anything he doesn&rsquo;t want to do, except if</p>
<p>and when his audience tells him, or the listeners that he cares</p>
<p>about, tell him his customers tell him, this is what we expect</p>
<p>and want from you. And then he responds to his customers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way the market works. And that&rsquo;s the way the</p>
<p>enterprise system should work. I think the separate bigger</p>
<p>question here, that&rsquo;s really important and worth noting.</p>
<p>You know, and I just want to speak about this for one second,</p>
<p>all of the great internet companies started with this</p>
<p>notion that they were creating democratization, that they were</p>
<p>creating access to information that didn&rsquo;t exist, whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>access to media or access to search results or access to</p>
<p>content or whatever, that may not have been available to you.</p>
<p>And that was a driving force for the entrepreneurs and the</p>
<p>founders that started all these businesses. And all of them had</p>
<p>these very idealistic points of view that we&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>censor, we&rsquo;re not going to take a point of view, we&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to put our foot down and say what is and isn&rsquo;t going to be</p>
<p>displayed or shown or made available to our users, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to let users choose what they want to get access to and</p>
<p>what they want to hear and listen to. And in all these</p>
<p>cases, from Google, to YouTube, to Twitter, and now to Spotify,</p>
<p>the idea of being just an access, a platform for access is</p>
<p>proving to be wrong. All of them are de facto publishers,</p>
<p>they ultimately have to make decisions about what they do and</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t let on the platform. And de facto, if you let something</p>
<p>on the platform, you&rsquo;re giving it permission, you&rsquo;re giving it</p>
<p>a voice, you&rsquo;re giving it amplification, and you&rsquo;re giving</p>
<p>it access. And so all of them are now getting caught up in</p>
<p>this problem that I don&rsquo;t think anyone from Larry or Sergey, or</p>
<p>Jack Dorsey or Daniel ever wanted to be in, they all wanted</p>
<p>to be these democratization platforms. And now they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>finding that there is no way to avoid being treated like a</p>
<p>publisher and a publisher has someone that&rsquo;s called an editor.</p>
<p>And an editor decides what is and isn&rsquo;t put on that publishing</p>
<p>platform, as has always been the case in old media. And now</p>
<p>in new media, they&rsquo;re all kind of stumbling into this problem.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not set up for it. And it&rsquo;s creating issues where</p>
<p>people on the right are saying you&rsquo;re censoring us. And people</p>
<p>on the left are saying you&rsquo;re not giving us access to</p>
<p>information we want. And it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s just kind of the</p>
<p>I think the transition that none of them expected, but we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>seeing happen.</p>
<p>Chamath, if Daniel Lack is giving $100 million to Joe</p>
<p>Rogan, can he claim listen, it&rsquo;s just we&rsquo;re a platform when</p>
<p>you know, listen, we&rsquo;re on Spotify as well, but they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>pay us. Doesn&rsquo;t it change the relationship when they give him</p>
<p>the 100 million? Or can Daniel say, you know, intellectually,</p>
<p>honestly, like, hey, listen, we&rsquo;re not responsible for this.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re backing up the brinks truck. And they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>promoting it like heck. Are they a publisher or not in your</p>
<p>mind?</p>
<p>I read yesterday that Barack and Michelle Obama&rsquo;s deal with</p>
<p>Spotify just expired, and they&rsquo;re going to shop it. I</p>
<p>suspect that somebody will pay them 10s of millions of dollars</p>
<p>to produce content. That&rsquo;s not illegal. And it&rsquo;s a sign of a</p>
<p>free market that&rsquo;s working. Spotify has a business to run.</p>
<p>And that business is to get content in front of the users</p>
<p>that are paying them a lot of money on a monthly basis to get</p>
<p>access to that stuff. And so who are we to say how Spotify</p>
<p>should run their business? I think you have a choice. Neil</p>
<p>Young expressed his choice. There was a person in the New</p>
<p>York Times, she took her podcast off of Spotify. Yep. There are</p>
<p>subscribers that probably left, but then there are also</p>
<p>subscribers that probably joined. Yep. And paid. Yeah. And</p>
<p>paid. And so the reality is, that&rsquo;s the free market, being</p>
<p>allowed to choose, and being allowed to vote with their feet.</p>
<p>And I think that all sides of that are in the right. So I</p>
<p>think Spotify should be allowed to run their business. I think</p>
<p>Joe Rogan should be allowed to say what he wants. If Spotify</p>
<p>chooses to put a disclaimer in front of that podcast, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>their right. And that&rsquo;s good, too. And if Joe Rogan decides</p>
<p>that he wants to have, you know, point counterpoint across</p>
<p>podcasts or within a podcast, that&rsquo;s laudable as well. And</p>
<p>that should be his decision. But I don&rsquo;t think people should</p>
<p>be forced to make these decisions by law, because I</p>
<p>think we get into a very slippery slope. Because you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t totally understand the incentives of the lawmaker</p>
<p>there. And we have a free market, as you&rsquo;re pointing out,</p>
<p>the framework is working perfectly. And more people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like this free market. More important than the free</p>
<p>market. We have a founding document of principles that we</p>
<p>all agree to. Yes. Yeah. And unfortunately, there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>people who don&rsquo;t agree. That says we have a right. So here</p>
<p>we go. Let&rsquo;s go to our constitutional attorney</p>
<p>counselor. Take us there. If you&rsquo;re talking about the</p>
<p>principle of free speech, there&rsquo;s a lot of people who</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t believe in it. That&rsquo;s the problem. First of all, you have</p>
<p>this geriatric hippie. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just Jerry, can I</p>
<p>finish? Let me finish my rant. You got this geriatric hit. I</p>
<p>love Neil Young. No, you know what happened here? Wait, sorry,</p>
<p>sex just there. That was J Cal seeing Oh shit, he&rsquo;s gonna get</p>
<p>a bell claster clip. He had to interrupt you there. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really brutal. J Cal. I thought you were talking. I thought</p>
<p>you were talking about Joe Biden. Can I explain what</p>
<p>happens? I think frankly, you guys are completely missing it.</p>
<p>The wheel of censorship broke on Joe Rogan this week. They</p>
<p>tried to Alex Jones him and it failed. Okay. First, you have</p>
<p>this geriatric hippie Neil Young, who somehow has turned</p>
<p>into a narc, and he plants a flag and he tries to get all</p>
<p>these people behind him. And the very online crowd says, Yes,</p>
<p>we got to cancel Rogan. And then you got Jen Psaki from the</p>
<p>White House, weighing in bringing in the coercive power</p>
<p>of the administration on the side of censorship. Okay. And</p>
<p>what happens? Rogan comes out with this nonpology, like you</p>
<p>said, and he seems so reasonable. He&rsquo;s a guy who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>inquisitive. He&rsquo;s on the side of just asking questions. He&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>the side of balance. He says, Yeah, look, I want to present</p>
<p>both sides of the issue. And everybody was like, there is no</p>
<p>reason to be censoring this guy. Rogan is an every man. And if</p>
<p>they would censor him, they would censor every man. And that</p>
<p>is why there was enormous backlash to it. And everybody</p>
<p>has opposed this. And so I think this is the week that this</p>
<p>ridiculous idea of censorship has broke. Now, it would be</p>
<p>nice if everybody to Chamath&rsquo;s point, did agree with this</p>
<p>principle, but they don&rsquo;t. The fact of the matter is, Jay Cowell</p>
<p>that censorship is now the official position of the</p>
<p>Democrat Party. And you see it in the poll numbers. There was a</p>
<p>great tweet that Glenn Greenwald Glenn Greenwald posted, where</p>
<p>he showed the polling numbers on this. So okay, you go back to</p>
<p>the days of the Obama administration, both Democrats</p>
<p>and Republicans agreed that the US government and tech</p>
<p>companies should not get involved in this type of</p>
<p>censorship. But today, there&rsquo;s been a bifurcation. Democrats or</p>
<p>lean Democrats versus Republicans who lean</p>
<p>Republicans. It&rsquo;s 6528 in favor of government taking steps to</p>
<p>restrict info online. And it&rsquo;s 7637. Democrats versus</p>
<p>Republicans on tech companies. So Congress, the First</p>
<p>Amendment is no longer a consensus. And that is</p>
<p>fundamentally the issue. But I gotta tell you, I think there</p>
<p>is a backlash against this. And I think that most of the</p>
<p>country now, and I think this is where they went too far is</p>
<p>that Rogan is not Alex Jones. He&rsquo;s not Trump. He&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>Milo Yiannopoulos. He seems like a reasonable guy. He is the</p>
<p>biggest figure in independent journalism. He gets 11 million</p>
<p>viewers every week. And I think there&rsquo;s a lot of people,</p>
<p>especially young people who are going, this has gone too far.</p>
<p>And by the way, I do not think Obama ever would have made this</p>
<p>political blunder of effectively denouncing Rogan</p>
<p>because Obama tried to appeal to young voters. And I think</p>
<p>Jen Psaki, by putting the administration on the side of</p>
<p>the censorship, they&rsquo;ve made a huge mistake. And the same week,</p>
<p>we saw that Tucker Carlson now gets more young Democrats</p>
<p>listening to his show than CNN and MSNBC. And I&rsquo;m telling you,</p>
<p>this is the reason why</p>
<p>Okay, Henry, you can put in the roaring crowd of applause at</p>
<p>this point. The best the best</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got big problems. I&rsquo;m telling you, Jacob, you got big</p>
<p>problems.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an independent. Stop making me the democrat. I&rsquo;m an</p>
<p>independent.</p>
<p>There are now more Tucker Democrats, okay? Among the key</p>
<p>young demographic.</p>
<p>In your writer&rsquo;s room or on Tucker&rsquo;s writer room? Which one?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Tucker Democrat, Jacob.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a Tucker. You are. You love, you love Obama. You love</p>
<p>Clinton. I think what&rsquo;s happening is that, I mean, and</p>
<p>Chamath, you&rsquo;ve said this over and over again.</p>
<p>Chamath?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, Chamath Palihapitiya.</p>
<p>You had on one side, you know, the right when lost their mind</p>
<p>in the all right, now they&rsquo;ve come a little bit more center.</p>
<p>And then you may not have the the democrats have lost their</p>
<p>minds. The fact that anybody can&rsquo;t look at Joe Rogan and say</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a comedian. He worked on a show where they fed people</p>
<p>shakes of blended insects, feel factor, and he&rsquo;s taking</p>
<p>mushrooms. And he&rsquo;s like, Why are you taking me so seriously?</p>
<p>Well, wait, I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Hold on. I think you&rsquo;re being super dismissive of Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s actually, as Zach said, a pretty reasonable,</p>
<p>curious person. And then yeah, he does the stuff that</p>
<p>everybody else does.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t prepare for the show. He literally said, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>prepare for the show. I don&rsquo;t do any preparation.</p>
<p>Maybe he doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>No, he said explicitly he doesn&rsquo;t. And he fact checks in</p>
<p>real time. So you got to keep your expectation at a certain</p>
<p>level with Joe Rogan, I think.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s a dig. I think that that&rsquo;s implausible to</p>
<p>believe. I know that that&rsquo;s what he said. But, you know, 11</p>
<p>million people a week, $100 million deal, I do suspect</p>
<p>that he does some sort of preparation. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a, he&rsquo;s completely winging it. Okay.</p>
<p>He literally said he wings it. But okay.</p>
<p>I understand that. But I think that&rsquo;s not the point.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay. The point is, whether he prepares or not, the excuse</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t sorry, the dog ate my homework. It&rsquo;s Hey, listen, I</p>
<p>have a right to have this guy on my show. Just like I have the</p>
<p>right to have this other guy on my show. You can listen to</p>
<p>both. And then you can decide for yourself.</p>
<p>You could change the channel.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s the important point. So Jason, I would not</p>
<p>like try to make this whole argument about whether he was</p>
<p>prepared or unprepared as the excuse. It&rsquo;s whether you</p>
<p>believe there&rsquo;s a fundamental right to free speech, or</p>
<p>whether you believe that people who disagree, can disavow</p>
<p>people and get them canceled and get them.</p>
<p>I obviously don&rsquo;t agree. I don&rsquo;t agree. Anybody should be</p>
<p>canceled. I think he should keep going.</p>
<p>Whatever Rogan&rsquo;s level of preparation, which I think is</p>
<p>actually pretty high, the people who are accusing him of</p>
<p>putting out misinformation are far more guilty of it</p>
<p>themselves. And I think one of the best points in Rogan&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nonpology, as you called it, is he said, Listen, a lot of the</p>
<p>things that we used to consider misinformation are now the</p>
<p>truth. For example, we&rsquo;ve talked about it on the show.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, we&rsquo;ve been ahead of the curve and calling all this</p>
<p>stuff out. You know, we could have been accused of</p>
<p>misinformation. So examples, the lab leak theory used to be</p>
<p>considered information. The cloth mask not doing anything.</p>
<p>Listen, Dan Bongino was kicked off YouTube two weeks before</p>
<p>the CDs for saying that Dan Bongino, he&rsquo;s a pretty big</p>
<p>conservative commentator. Okay, he&rsquo;s got an audience of</p>
<p>millions, you can be dismissive, but a lot of people like him.</p>
<p>Yeah, Jake out. But look, my point is, he was kicked off</p>
<p>YouTube for saying cloth masks don&rsquo;t work. Then the CDC comes</p>
<p>out two weeks later, and says the same thing, right?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a valid point.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, it&rsquo;s the key point.</p>
<p>I personally like you know, for example, we&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>this thing where like, if you look at like the top</p>
<p>distributed links on Facebook, who do you see Ben Shapiro?</p>
<p>Yeah, Dan Bongino? You know, bright Joe Rogan, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My takeaway with all of these things is there are people of</p>
<p>those things, if I listened to, I&rsquo;d probably find abhorrent.</p>
<p>But there are people there that are probably I would be, you</p>
<p>know, I would, I would, I would, they would appeal to me. In all</p>
<p>cases, they should all exist, though, because the whole point</p>
<p>is let me spider my way through this stuff and figure out for</p>
<p>myself. Yeah, what works and what doesn&rsquo;t work?</p>
<p>Yeah, more speech is the best counter.</p>
<p>The summary of this that makes the most sense is Elon tweeted</p>
<p>this out, Nick, you can put this because I gave you the image,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a meme of Neil Young, where it says, if you</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t censor the guy I don&rsquo;t like, I won&rsquo;t let you listen to</p>
<p>keep on rocking in a free world.</p>
<p>Practical, yeah.</p>
<p>And, and it&rsquo;s, and it&rsquo;s just so true, which is like, on the one</p>
<p>hand, you know, you are a standard bearer. Now, maybe what</p>
<p>we should really do is talk about what has happened to this</p>
<p>boomer generation over the last 50 years, where they were, you</p>
<p>know, sex, drugs, rock and roll, no war in Vietnam, let&rsquo;s fight</p>
<p>for our rights, let&rsquo;s fight for equality, then punk rock, you</p>
<p>know, no, I&rsquo;m talking about just those, those, those folks back</p>
<p>then, who are now 50 years later, you know, sitting on $70</p>
<p>trillion of wealth, and who are basically like, you can&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>this, you can&rsquo;t say that. Don&rsquo;t do this. Don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Wear masks, don&rsquo;t leave your house.</p>
<p>You know, yeah.</p>
<p>Fauci is right.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re scared, because they&rsquo;re old.</p>
<p>Wear masks, don&rsquo;t or you&rsquo;re getting a pangolin.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, this is, I mean, that generation, I think we</p>
<p>all have some soul searching to do about what happened to that</p>
<p>generation.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re scared, because they&rsquo;re old, and they feel like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to die from COVID.</p>
<p>Is it that generation, or is it the fact that every generation</p>
<p>rebels against the prior and ultimately becomes conservative?</p>
<p>And, you know, that&rsquo;s the, that&rsquo;s just how life goes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ve become conservative.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;ve become authoritarian.</p>
<p>I think that what happened is they&rsquo;re now in power.</p>
<p>The boomers are in power.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been making the decisions for the last 20 years.</p>
<p>I think there is enormous popular discontent with the way the</p>
<p>country&rsquo;s been run over the last two decades, the futile,</p>
<p>pointless wars in the Middle East, the debt, the economy,</p>
<p>the unfairness that goes on and on.</p>
<p>And what, and especially with COVID, I mean, this COVID policy</p>
<p>over the last two years has been a fiasco.</p>
<p>And the point of this censorship of misinformation is to suppress</p>
<p>the debate.</p>
<p>I mean, what ultimately is the point on take, for example,</p>
<p>COVID of saying that people cannot take a point of view, it</p>
<p>is to stifle the debate that&rsquo;s to prevent an honest debate on</p>
<p>these issues.</p>
<p>And the people have an interest in doing that are the people who</p>
<p>are in charge and are failing.</p>
<p>And if you gave people the information, they&rsquo;d be voted out</p>
<p>of office.</p>
<p>If you look when I asked what are the specific claims that</p>
<p>either Joe Rogan or his guests made that people are objecting</p>
<p>to a lot of the people who are objecting and wanted him</p>
<p>censored, really didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And one of them was he said early on, I don&rsquo;t know for a</p>
<p>young person who&rsquo;s in shape, if I would advise them to take the</p>
<p>vaccine.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people who have that position, which is like if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re young, and I think actually, Friedberg, you might</p>
<p>have said mRNA early on in this podcast is a very new</p>
<p>technology.</p>
<p>And I could see people wanting to wait and see.</p>
<p>Did you not say that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get you canceled here.</p>
<p>But I think we did have that discussion, have that</p>
<p>conversation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a valid conversation.</p>
<p>mRNA is a new technology, right?</p>
<p>Freeberg, you should think about it.</p>
<p>And we should be cautious.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t draw me into your cancel.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I said we I just changed it to we were talking</p>
<p>about that.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you remember that discussion we had like, and I</p>
<p>asked you, I think, mRNA, what do you think of this versus the</p>
<p>regular one, the J&amp;J?</p>
<p>I think generally, we&rsquo;ve seen science being used as a way as a</p>
<p>term to discredit what I think would arguably and typically be</p>
<p>scientific principles, which is inquiry, challenging</p>
<p>hypotheses, and having, you know, vigorous debate to resolve</p>
<p>to some sort of objective truth.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you&rsquo;re having some sort of subjective belief.</p>
<p>And more often than not, we&rsquo;ve seen politicians and others</p>
<p>grab on to the term science and saying, this is science, it says</p>
<p>this, when in fact, the process of science is inquiry, and it is</p>
<p>to challenge, you know, again, a hypothesis and what might be</p>
<p>kind of a thesis.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I think generally, this has been a pretty scary</p>
<p>time to watch, because it&rsquo;s almost like gaslighting, you</p>
<p>know, it&rsquo;s like, hey, you know, you&rsquo;re using the term science</p>
<p>to discredit the notion of science.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been pretty brutal.</p>
<p>I sent you guys this, this cartoon link, by the way, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so funny.</p>
<p>Oh, I just got an old left versus the modern left.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Volkswagen bus with a bunch of hippie dippy flowers.</p>
<p>And it says free speech, free love 1971.</p>
<p>No CIA, screw the establishment, resist authority.</p>
<p>And then it shows like a modern SUV with 2021.</p>
<p>It says masks up, I heart the CDC, obey the establishment,</p>
<p>no free speech, do what you&rsquo;re told obey.</p>
<p>Basically, you have another poll you want to share sex?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, this is a really interesting one.</p>
<p>It says a majority of voters 55% say COVID should be treated</p>
<p>as an endemic disease, while a majority of Democrats say it</p>
<p>should be continued to be treated as an emergency.</p>
<p>And then there was a similar poll, the Monmouth poll just</p>
<p>came out where 89% of Republicans 71% of independents</p>
<p>say that it&rsquo;s time we accept we accept COVID is here to say</p>
<p>we need to get on with our lives.</p>
<p>Only 40% of Democrats.</p>
<p>So the reality is that the rest of the country I think has</p>
<p>moved on, it&rsquo;s ready to move on.</p>
<p>The split is not between Democrats or Republicans anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s within the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party is now divided on this question of</p>
<p>whether we should move on as a country past COVID.</p>
<p>Half of the Democratic Party still believes that COVID</p>
<p>should be treated as this emergency.</p>
<p>Do you think that it&rsquo;s cut by age?</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a bias by age?</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>I think yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>Old people are more scared.</p>
<p>But I think I think the media and the party they&rsquo;ve programmed</p>
<p>their soldiers to be, you know, to treat COVID as an</p>
<p>emergency, and they can&rsquo;t deprogram them.</p>
<p>And this is why I think we&rsquo;re seeing Tucker&rsquo;s Tucker is now</p>
<p>the biggest demographic among young Democrats.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s insane to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>The idea that idea is insane.</p>
<p>This does not bode well for the on top of everything else</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening in the country.</p>
<p>This is not bode well for the Democrats in November.</p>
<p>And then you had this crazy thing at the, you know, the</p>
<p>Magic Johnson party at that held my breath.</p>
<p>I took a picture of Magic Johnson.</p>
<p>I held my breath so I wouldn&rsquo;t get the virus with Garcetti</p>
<p>and Newsom Newsom claims the new I didn&rsquo;t inhale.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And then he says that he was only photographed at the exact</p>
<p>moment where he took off his mask for two seconds, you know,</p>
<p>you know what, if you go to the ski slopes, there is nobody</p>
<p>with a mask on and nobody&rsquo;s enforcing it and no restaurants</p>
<p>and this is in democratic country.</p>
<p>Everybody has moved on at this point.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s willing to why haven&rsquo;t they why haven&rsquo;t why</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t the media and the politician because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>virtual signaling and they want to keep power.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You tell me that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>Well, I think they&rsquo;re dumb.</p>
<p>They should take the position that we reopen.</p>
<p>Yeah, they should just take the rails but wouldn&rsquo;t take in</p>
<p>the reopening position get you more voters at this point.</p>
<p>People are tired of this.</p>
<p>They want to move on.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making a bad political decision.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re holding to their base.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point is I think I think the whole country has</p>
<p>moved on even most Democrats have moved on, but the</p>
<p>democratic base has not moved on.</p>
<p>And that is why, you know, Newsom and Garcetti have to</p>
<p>pay lip service to this.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, and these guys have been telling everybody</p>
<p>gotta wear a mask, gotta wear a mask, and they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>wearing masks.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s face it.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t wearing masks at the front French laundry.</p>
<p>They have never worn masks.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been throwing their own parties with no masks.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a bunch of hypocrites.</p>
<p>The whole lot of them.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>In other news, Xi Jinping and Putin got together and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>apparently besties.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the quote some actors representing, but the</p>
<p>minority on the international scale.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s us continue to advocate unilateral approaches</p>
<p>to addressing international issues and resort to force.</p>
<p>They interfere in the internal affairs of other states</p>
<p>infringing their legitimate rights and interest and incite</p>
<p>contradictions, differences and confrontation.</p>
<p>The statement said, I am willing to work with President</p>
<p>Vladimir Putin to plan a blueprint and guide the</p>
<p>direction of Sino Russian relations under new historical</p>
<p>conditions.</p>
<p>Mr. Xi said he added that China and Russia should act like big</p>
<p>countries as they intensify coordination on fighting the</p>
<p>Coronavirus pandemic, yada yada.</p>
<p>Any feedback from our squad?</p>
<p>I mean, you could have rewritten that press release as you know,</p>
<p>we will we want to try to destroy us hegemony and replace</p>
<p>it with ourselves.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of the end of US cultural and economic</p>
<p>influence globally, or dominance, rather influence</p>
<p>globally.</p>
<p>And I think that it&rsquo;s, you know, something that we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about quite a lot.</p>
<p>You know, I mentioned in the prediction episode that I</p>
<p>thought that Putin was going to play a major role this year.</p>
<p>And, and, you know, he&rsquo;s clearly not just, you know, out</p>
<p>for his own interests, but he&rsquo;s going to play a really</p>
<p>important role in China&rsquo;s rise to economic and cultural</p>
<p>dominance.</p>
<p>You agree, Chamath, is this the sign that they&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>running the show?</p>
<p>Or does this look like something else to you?</p>
<p>No, no, no, I don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s a show to run.</p>
<p>I think the point is that there was a first among equals for</p>
<p>the last many decades in the world order where, you know,</p>
<p>America was it was that first among equals.</p>
<p>And I think what they&rsquo;re saying is that it&rsquo;s time for that to</p>
<p>change.</p>
<p>And, and, and they&rsquo;re going to tie that to their ability to</p>
<p>influence foreign policy in countries the way that we have</p>
<p>historically.</p>
<p>So, you know, this is sort of basically putting a marker on</p>
<p>the table that says, this is going to be about, you know, a</p>
<p>different cohort of people that are also going to have an equal</p>
<p>say.</p>
<p>And if you think about where this all plays out, it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>in economics, right?</p>
<p>And this is where, again, you have to think about what China</p>
<p>has done, which is they have while we were fighting wars,</p>
<p>you know, putting trillions of dollars into the Middle East,</p>
<p>they took their trillion dollars and bought resources all</p>
<p>through Africa.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>They built infrastructure, they bought infrastructure all</p>
<p>through South America.</p>
<p>They put infrastructure all through Southeast Asia, you</p>
<p>know, that say, call it $15 trillion that we spent in one</p>
<p>direction, they spent another, that&rsquo;s a $30 trillion gap,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to create a resource imbalance that they</p>
<p>will use to create even more influence in the future.</p>
<p>And we have to figure out a way to counteract that.</p>
<p>Sax, what do you think?</p>
<p>Is this a changing moment in the world order?</p>
<p>Should we be worried that these two dictators are going to act</p>
<p>in unison, and then maybe one gets the Ukraine, one gets</p>
<p>Taiwan?</p>
<p>Is this like really earth shattering news?</p>
<p>Or do you think it&rsquo;s saber rattling and not that big of a</p>
<p>deal?</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s a dramatic statement and photo that was</p>
<p>was put out.</p>
<p>It was a continuation of what we&rsquo;ve seen where they have, you</p>
<p>know, Xi and Putin have been getting and Russia and China,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been getting friendlier and friendlier.</p>
<p>What saddens me and sort of sickens me as really an American</p>
<p>patriot who would like to see the American world order</p>
<p>continue is the way that we have blundered and created this</p>
<p>type of situation.</p>
<p>So, to Chamath&rsquo;s point, first of all, we wasted 20 years</p>
<p>trying to do nation building in the Middle East, we wasted</p>
<p>$6 trillion on that.</p>
<p>How did China, you know, lose by not being part of that?</p>
<p>They benefited, they were building Belt and Road while we</p>
<p>were, you know, engaged in this foolish interventions in the</p>
<p>Middle East.</p>
<p>And now more recently with Putin, we&rsquo;ve really driven Putin</p>
<p>into Xi&rsquo;s arms because we keep threatening to add Ukraine to</p>
<p>NATO, which is not something that&rsquo;s in America&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>If we would just give up on that position, or just reaffirm</p>
<p>that Ukraine should not be admitted to NATO, it would</p>
<p>enormously help defuse tensions with Russia.</p>
<p>And by the way, your point that these are dictators or</p>
<p>natural allies, that&rsquo;s not historically been true.</p>
<p>So, during the days of the Soviet Union, you know, you had</p>
<p>Nixon and Kissinger make the great opening to Mao and China,</p>
<p>and we were able to cultivate a relationship there because</p>
<p>China and Russia were natural antagonists.</p>
<p>And it was a major move in the Cold War that we were able to</p>
<p>cultivate Mao.</p>
<p>And we did so even though he was a dictator with blood on his</p>
<p>hands.</p>
<p>So Russia and China are not natural allies, we should be</p>
<p>doing a better job of not so thoroughly alienating Putin that</p>
<p>he is rushing into his arms.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the blunder I see here.</p>
<p>By the way, after this summit, they&rsquo;re going to meet with</p>
<p>Iran.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tripartite think access of dictators.</p>
<p>This is like the Legion of Doom.</p>
<p>We need to be playing our cards a lot in a much smarter way.</p>
<p>Yeah, we need to play our cards.</p>
<p>What is the strategy?</p>
<p>I mean, look, we want the American led world order to</p>
<p>continue, but we got to be much more selective about picking</p>
<p>and choosing our battles.</p>
<p>Yeah, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, they were huge mistakes.</p>
<p>And now on top of it, what about Ukraine?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Yeah, looking forward, like you keep bringing up the past,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the look forward strategy in your mind?</p>
<p>The look forward strategy, I think, is to diffuse and</p>
<p>deescalate the situation in Ukraine, exactly the way Obama</p>
<p>did it, which is to recognize that America does not have a</p>
<p>vital national interest the way that Russia does to hold on to</p>
<p>reaffirm that the nations of the caucuses that have border</p>
<p>disputes with Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, they are not</p>
<p>eligible candidates for NATO at the present time, kick that</p>
<p>can down the road by 10 years.</p>
<p>Okay, we talked about that last time.</p>
<p>Taiwan is a much more complicated situation.</p>
<p>I do think we have a vital national interest there.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Okay, so two very different situations.</p>
<p>I actually agree with you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think Taiwan, we have to hold the line.</p>
<p>Yeah, we have a responsibility in the United States.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re starting to do it.</p>
<p>So I think there is good news where, you know, part of the</p>
<p>strategic vital interest for Taiwan is because they have</p>
<p>critical resources that we need.</p>
<p>And we depend on and specifically, those are</p>
<p>semiconductors.</p>
<p>You know, we have now I think, allocated, you know, 50 $100</p>
<p>billion of capital of capex across a bunch of companies</p>
<p>that have committed to building domestic capability.</p>
<p>And so we have to make sure we follow through on that, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>successful.</p>
<p>And the reason is that it gives us optionality, it allows us to</p>
<p>breathe, it allows us to actually make rational decisions</p>
<p>and be patient in our decision making.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s going to be really important over the next</p>
<p>10 or 20 years.</p>
<p>And so we have to invest in the United States.</p>
<p>So the solution to all of these things is we cannot be overly</p>
<p>dependent on any one country, any one shipping lane, any one</p>
<p>product, any one natural resource, you just</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t do that anymore.</p>
<p>We have to be strong at home.</p>
<p>And we have to build strong relationships with other</p>
<p>countries.</p>
<p>And yeah, I think I think we&rsquo;ve got a an operating philosophy</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>All right, listen, let&rsquo;s wrap there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see everybody on the next episode for the dictator</p>
<p>Chamath Palihapitiya, the Sultan of Science, David Friedberg,</p>
<p>and the rain man himself triumphant versus Peter Thiel and</p>
<p>that PayPal match.</p>
<p>Great moment.</p>
<p>David sacks.</p>
<p>Love you boys.</p>
<p>Love you besties.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just like this like sexual tension that</p>
<p>they just need to release somehow.</p>
