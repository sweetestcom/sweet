    <p>It&rsquo;s Hardcore History, Attention!</p>
<p>So last October 2019, right around Halloween, I was in Toronto to do a promotional event</p>
<p>for The End is Always Near, the book I got out last year.</p>
<p>And I went to the theater and I met the guy who was going to be the interviewer, it was</p>
<p>a Q&amp;A set up, which works really well in these kinds of environments.</p>
<p>And I sat down and just had the best time for a little while before the actual event,</p>
<p>getting to know Canadian broadcaster Jeff Merrick.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know Jeff, it&rsquo;s probably because you live in the United States or somewhere</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s not, well he&rsquo;s a hockey savant, so you know, knowing about hockey or being</p>
<p>in a country where hockey&rsquo;s important might help.</p>
<p>Jeff is a host on Roger&rsquo;s Sportsnet, he&rsquo;s a co-host of the 31 Thoughts podcast and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just an awesome guy.</p>
<p>So we hit it off right away, and then we went on stage, and I do these things from</p>
<p>time to time, and most of the events you hear the same questions over and over, and Jeff</p>
<p>had just great questions, different questions, he knew my stuff, he&rsquo;d done his homework,</p>
<p>we just had a great time.</p>
<p>And I said afterwards, let&rsquo;s not lose touch, and he got a hold of me a couple months later</p>
<p>and said, you know, I&rsquo;ve been looking on the internet at some of the interviews you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done over the years, and I just think, you have a free show or two of your own, you could</p>
<p>just crank out really quickly if somebody just interviewed you, you know, maybe on</p>
<p>your hardcore history addendum feed or something.</p>
<p>And I said to him, I said, listen, it ain&rsquo;t always that good, it depends on the questioner</p>
<p>and all these kinds of things, and I basically told him, you know, it was great, Toronto</p>
<p>though, if somebody wanted to do it again, and long story short, Jeff was willing to</p>
<p>get roped into this a second time, and long story short again, if you don&rsquo;t like this</p>
<p>program, remember Jeff works at Rogers Sportsnet, and there&rsquo;s probably an email you can get</p>
<p>in touch with him to complain on their website, so Jeff, that&rsquo;s my thank you for hosting this</p>
<p>and being such a good guy, all the complaint mail goes to you.</p>
<p>So let me just tell you that this was a coronavirus-inspired program, meaning we did things a little differently</p>
<p>than normal on both ends of the interview, so there are a couple of digital glitches</p>
<p>or dropouts, I apologize, there was no way to fix them, so you&rsquo;ll notice them in there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have some conversation for you, a few notes, a few updates, and some teases maybe</p>
<p>even at the end of the show.</p>
<p>So without further ado, Jeff Merrick returns, and hopefully only the second out of many</p>
<p>times in the future, to discuss whatever the heck he wants to for the next, what, hour</p>
<p>and something.</p>
<p>So Jeff, take it away.</p>
<p>Today, you&rsquo;re the host.</p>
<p>You know what I wouldn&rsquo;t mind talking about to kick it off, Dan?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I would like to talk about the title of your book, which I love because I was a huge Doors</p>
<p>fan.</p>
<p>Now, true or false, The End Is Always Near is a tribute to Jim Morrison and the Doors.</p>
<p>Well, I think the broad answer is true.</p>
<p>I wanted to have, I always like those books that have sort of the, in italics, a quote</p>
<p>or a famous phrase or something to lead off each chapter.</p>
<p>And so at one point in my book design, I was going to have one of those leading off each</p>
<p>chapter.</p>
<p>And I had the Jim Morrison line, the future&rsquo;s uncertain and the end is always near, before</p>
<p>finding out how expensively copywritten that whole phrase was.</p>
<p>But so somehow, as these things tend to go, you know, somewhere down the line, these things</p>
<p>find their way back in a transmuted form or another, and the fact that it became a partial</p>
<p>title of the book is a little bit surprising, but that&rsquo;s how it was originally going to</p>
<p>be.</p>
<p>And so in a roundabout way, the answer is yes.</p>
<p>Because I was a huge Doors fan as well, and I think, you know, for a period of time there,</p>
<p>that was pretty much all that I listened to.</p>
<p>I was fascinated with Jim Morrison, was an on-ramp to a lot of poetry, a lot of literature,</p>
<p>a lot of brainy, geeky kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And the music was fantastic as well, and it made me appreciate something about myself</p>
<p>with music.</p>
<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;re similar, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Things that have a brooding undercurrent, I find that I really enjoy.</p>
<p>That type of music.</p>
<p>You can, I&rsquo;ve always believed you can write in two separate moods.</p>
<p>You can write in either bloom or you can write in brood.</p>
<p>And for me, the Doors, as far as American bands go, whether it&rsquo;s Riders on the Storm,</p>
<p>The End, or even The End is Always Near, which is just a great bar tune at the end of it</p>
<p>as well, had that element of brooding.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, when I first saw the book, Dan, I said, okay, this is going to hit me</p>
<p>where I live.</p>
<p>Carlin gets it.</p>
<p>You know, this is, I&rsquo;m flashing back to our conversation in Toronto, because you asked</p>
<p>the most interesting, different questions.</p>
<p>Because normally when you talk to people and they ask questions, you get the same ones</p>
<p>all the time.</p>
<p>And nobody ever asked me about things like music and stuff, but boy, I feel exactly like</p>
<p>you do.</p>
<p>And I want to add something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to add a different emotion to the brooding versus the blooming.</p>
<p>A friend of mine used to say, when we were growing up, he said that he was a Pink Floyd</p>
<p>fan and he said that there was something about the rhythm of Pink Floyd&rsquo;s music that synced</p>
<p>up with his internal heartbeat or his rhythm or something, right?</p>
<p>And I remember thinking that it would had to have been turned up to like 78 speed on</p>
<p>my record album to have synced up with mine.</p>
<p>And so I always gravitated towards something that was, Iggy Pop said he had a heart full</p>
<p>of napalm instead of a heart full of soul.</p>
<p>And so, yes, I like the darker stuff, but I like the Stones, Give Me Shelter, right?</p>
<p>If you go look at the Rolling Stones, I always tell people, go online, look at them in like</p>
<p>1971, 72, live in that era, 1970.</p>
<p>To me, that sounds like a punk band, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very stripped down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, I mean, it sounds like what it really is, what punk really is, too.</p>
<p>What the Doors really were, too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a stripped down kind of rock and roll where the brooding slash edge comes through.</p>
<p>And I should say this, this isn&rsquo;t as much with the punk stuff as with the Stones and</p>
<p>the Doors, but there&rsquo;s also a little bluesy thing going on there, too, that I think really</p>
<p>ties it together.</p>
<p>And so in answer to your question, yes, when I was a kid, there was a lot of music that</p>
<p>was popular in the 70s, Peter Frampton, Foreigner.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t speak to me at all.</p>
<p>And so I went back and listened to the stuff that you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>And then when the stuff that was similar in sort of tone, feel, vibe came again with 77,</p>
<p>78, 79 and the punk and the new wave stuff, that spoke to me, too, the same way that Nirvana</p>
<p>and all that grunge stuff spoke to the people who liked the early punk stuff.</p>
<p>See, but I think what we&rsquo;re talking about, too, is sort of music.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve written about this and you&rsquo;ve talked about this on various podcasts as well.</p>
<p>This idea of studying behavior at the extremes, when you stretch the elastic to the point</p>
<p>at which it can no longer stretch, you know, what&rsquo;s the behavior around that?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated with that as well.</p>
<p>And I see that, you know, this comes out and I think we have a mutual admiration for the</p>
<p>sport of boxing, for example, sports like MMA, these types of events where really I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>always wondered, you know, why am I attracted to things like boxing?</p>
<p>Why am I always attracted to Shakespearean slasher plays, you know, Titus Andronicus,</p>
<p>heads rolling all over the stage, blood all over the stage.</p>
<p>And I am King Curtain.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like, why am I attracted to that?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m a pretty left left wing leaning kind of guy.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m a typical Canadian, you know, always looking to apologize and make accommodations</p>
<p>for everybody.</p>
<p>Where does that come from?</p>
<p>And I find myself in a situation where I think I&rsquo;m attracted to events and sports and situations</p>
<p>that exist without metaphor, where everything you say you want to do is what you want to</p>
<p>do.</p>
<p>Everything you intend to do.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no, you know, in some sports they&rsquo;ll say, oh yeah, I really want to kill</p>
<p>this guy.</p>
<p>Well, no, you really don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But then there are sports where you really kind of do like there are sports where that</p>
<p>metaphor doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>It is a metaphorless environment.</p>
<p>And I think maybe that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m attracted to music that speaks there and sports that</p>
<p>speaks there as well.</p>
<p>There is, um, I pulled it off of my bookshelf just now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a Latin phrase I read and I, I hope it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those things I&rsquo;ve learned in my line of work, not to just blithely quote or</p>
<p>assume any quote is true.</p>
<p>So I always, I always disclaim it a little bit, but it&rsquo;s an inscription in Latin that</p>
<p>says it will give you pleasure to look back on this scene of suffering.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s about sort of the love of history, kind of right.</p>
<p>The fact that, isn&rsquo;t it weird that people like you or people like me who are such, um,</p>
<p>you know, I like to think of myself as sort of a humanist, right?</p>
<p>Why would I enjoy seeing scenes from history involving suffering?</p>
<p>Why would I enjoy watching Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier at the Thrilla in Manila come as</p>
<p>close to death as Muhammad Ali said, as he&rsquo;d ever been?</p>
<p>Why is that interesting, entertaining, uh, why would I go back and watch it again?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I mean, what is it about our character?</p>
<p>I had a professor, uh, the late great Robert Poise at the university of Colorado.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s famous there.</p>
<p>They planted a tree after he died.</p>
<p>Uh, he, he, he had said almost the same thing you did.</p>
<p>He said, why?</p>
<p>He called himself a lily hearted, bleeding heart liberal.</p>
<p>And he said, why would a lily hearted, bleeding heart liberal like myself be so fascinated</p>
<p>by these right wing strong man dictatorial?</p>
<p>He was like a Nazi history professor in terms of what he focused on a Bismarck and those</p>
<p>guys.</p>
<p>And he questioned himself, why am I interested in this stuff?</p>
<p>Um, I don&rsquo;t think we have an answer, but I do think there&rsquo;s the wonderful side of it</p>
<p>where we can enjoy it.</p>
<p>Like that Latin inscription says, look back on this play and not have to be a part of</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same sort of vicarious thrill we could have at the time where I wrote my book</p>
<p>talking about how strange it would be to live in a pandemic and how science fiction</p>
<p>like that might be an, Oh wow.</p>
<p>Can you even imagine?</p>
<p>And then to have it happen where you kind of go, Oh yeah, I, I much more liked the theorizing</p>
<p>back in the day when this was a theoretical than I do now.</p>
<p>And now we find ourselves, you know, all, you know, various Edward Hopper paintings</p>
<p>or at least that&rsquo;s how we feel right now.</p>
<p>It is bizarre, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bizarre.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, um, and, and, but the, the interesting thing about it, um, to me, and, and again,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re all on quarantine, you know, I&rsquo;m removed from my job and surrounded by</p>
<p>my family 24 hours a day and, um, I love it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so much sure that they do, but you know, I, I, I look at this and I say, is this</p>
<p>bizarre?</p>
<p>Is this weird?</p>
<p>Is this freakish or have the last, I don&rsquo;t know, 150 years been the freak?</p>
<p>And is this just sort of what reality always has been?</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s caught up to us.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s exactly what I couldn&rsquo;t have phrased it better myself.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s exactly, I think, uh, uh, to paraphrase, uh, uh, I think it was Samuel</p>
<p>Huntington when he said the end of history, we&rsquo;ve been living in a break, uh, a break</p>
<p>from a rhythm that our forebears knew so well and here, and this is the part that, uh, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard to get your mind around as crazy as everything&rsquo;s been.</p>
<p>They never had the luxury of only having one bad disease out there, right?</p>
<p>When they had all the bad diseases you can think of, they had all the other bad diseases</p>
<p>at the same time.</p>
<p>So you didn&rsquo;t just have cholera, right?</p>
<p>You had smallpox, you didn&rsquo;t just have plague, you know, you had typhus, it was all there</p>
<p>together.</p>
<p>And you had measles and mumps and all the childhood diseases that killed you once upon</p>
<p>a time.</p>
<p>So I think about this as the tiniest little taste of what it used to be like.</p>
<p>And I sit there and shudder because look at what it&rsquo;s done to us with just the tiniest</p>
<p>little taste.</p>
<p>And I could say that the reason it&rsquo;s done this much to us is because we haven&rsquo;t been</p>
<p>accustomed to feeding on this sort of problem for a while and maybe you grow a little bit</p>
<p>more calloused and a little bit more resilient or maybe your system has become a little bit</p>
<p>less fragile over time if the disease rates higher and more lethal than it traditionally</p>
<p>is like now.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is a, you know, what I said in the book, people are saying all</p>
<p>the time, I had an Israeli reporter to me the other day say, is this helping book sales</p>
<p>as though this is a good thing, right?</p>
<p>We have a pandemic and I was talking about it.</p>
<p>But you know, every major thinker, expert, I mean, heck, Bill Gates for the last decade</p>
<p>has been saying something like this was coming.</p>
<p>What I think is fascinating from the history side of it, though, because all I did in the</p>
<p>book was pick out these historical situations to show sort of how humans have behaved in</p>
<p>those circumstances before and that seems remarkably instructive for sort of how we</p>
<p>behave today.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the part that&rsquo;s kind of interesting where you go, you know, times change, medicine</p>
<p>evolves, but we human beings are about as panicky and predictable as we&rsquo;ve always been</p>
<p>in groups.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting about that comment, you know, how is this helping book sales?</p>
<p>And I think of the old Carney saying, what we lose on the swings, we gain on the roundabouts</p>
<p>through all of this.</p>
<p>You mentioned resiliency there a second ago, when we were in Toronto together, we talked</p>
<p>you and I about the difference between, you know, Canada and the United States and where</p>
<p>the United States is more based on an ethic of conquer.</p>
<p>Canada is traditionally based more on the idea of survival.</p>
<p>And I do wonder if what we&rsquo;re seeing right now is a clash between business and institution.</p>
<p>And always the default has been business can solve this, business can be bloated, only</p>
<p>necessary things, chop it right down to the bone.</p>
<p>I mean, business hates excess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about bottom line.</p>
<p>It has no time for something like institution.</p>
<p>Institution is slow.</p>
<p>Institution is bloated.</p>
<p>Institution is a waste of money.</p>
<p>But right now we find ourself in the situation, Dan, where it&rsquo;s the institutions that are</p>
<p>probably going to get us out of this thing, not business.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re starting to see that clash each and every day.</p>
<p>I wonder how, I really do wonder where this one ends up.</p>
<p>And if at the end of all of this, there&rsquo;s more of a, there&rsquo;s more of a premium placed</p>
<p>on not chasing speed, not chasing a fast dollar, but maybe we slow down a little bit.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;re a little bit more deliberate in what we do.</p>
<p>Maybe we think a little bit more about our choices.</p>
<p>I mean, right now we&rsquo;re looking at, I think this battle between efficiency and endurance.</p>
<p>And right now what we need more so than efficiency is that type of institutional endurance that</p>
<p>business has always had nothing but contempt for.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a fantastic analysis.</p>
<p>I said to somebody else recently, too, we were talking about maybe the way something</p>
<p>like the current situation we&rsquo;re going through makes us simply reframe the lens through which</p>
<p>we view some of this stuff.</p>
<p>So whereas a business institution running a hospital might see a lot of ventilators</p>
<p>that no one is using and a lot of hospital beds that are empty as waste, at a time like</p>
<p>now that looks more like insurance.</p>
<p>And when you look at the costs of what we&rsquo;re going through now, it looks like relatively</p>
<p>cheap insurance.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s simply something that comes into play as part of the, I would call it the give</p>
<p>and take.</p>
<p>My stepfather&rsquo;s metaphor for it was a tug of war.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a tug of war.</p>
<p>I would call it the institutional side, that&rsquo;s a good way to put it, and the business side.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re pulling, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both pulling in opposite directions.</p>
<p>And sometimes I would argue we&rsquo;ve lived through, and I don&rsquo;t think I have to make much of a</p>
<p>point on this, an amazing growth stage in terms of the information revolution, the 1990s,</p>
<p>the 2000s, the phones, the texting, the social media, the whole thing, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a giant, huge boon on the business side of things with institutions playing catch-up.</p>
<p>So imagine that tug of war leaning heavily toward the business side of things for a while.</p>
<p>And then the realities of existence, like plagues, coming into play to force some correction</p>
<p>on the institutional side of things, pulling the rope back towards the center a little</p>
<p>bit.</p>
<p>If only because one is theoretical, on the business side of things, you can push, you</p>
<p>can push, you can push, maximize profits, maximize gain, maximize stock price until</p>
<p>something stops you.</p>
<p>Now that could be the market.</p>
<p>That could be your own business model.</p>
<p>That could be what it is you sell not being desired anymore.</p>
<p>Or it could be a black swan event like what we&rsquo;re going through now, right?</p>
<p>Or a 9-11 attacks or anything like that where all of a sudden, okay, you have to stop and</p>
<p>think for a while.</p>
<p>Your momentum, your forward momentum is slowed for a reason, and you have to ask yourself</p>
<p>whether or not this is a temporary break on things and we can continue to do things just</p>
<p>the way we did after a slight pause, or whether, as you were suggesting, this is a lesson,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And the lesson is let&rsquo;s not get caught again.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s build in some resiliency, some redundancy, and some ability to counteract what this plague</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going through right now has exposed in terms of our systemic fragility, maybe</p>
<p>is a good way to put it.</p>
<p>So I think I would make the case that there&rsquo;s always the balance between the institutions</p>
<p>and the business side of things, and that it&rsquo;s been slanted toward the business side</p>
<p>of things because the pace of change has been such that it would be crazy, I think, to imagine</p>
<p>the institutions keeping up with it.</p>
<p>And by the way, not just that, but they inherently move more slowly because, I mean, the pace</p>
<p>of change on the business side slash tech side of things, I&rsquo;m not sure how brick and</p>
<p>mortar things can keep up with it.</p>
<p>So I think maybe what you&rsquo;re suggesting makes some sense, at least from the vantage point</p>
<p>where we can see it here in the midst of it.</p>
<p>It seems like it&rsquo;s exposed something where you go, well, let&rsquo;s not get caught without</p>
<p>enough ventilators again, you know, things like that.</p>
<p>And then what becomes of us at the end of all of this is another question.</p>
<p>Elliot Friedman, who I do the 31 Thoughts podcast with, his grandmother always had the</p>
<p>best saying, you plan, God laughs.</p>
<p>We all have an idea of what this is going to be at the end of all of it.</p>
<p>But I can&rsquo;t, Dan, help but feeling, I guess we all try to figure out who we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be when all of this is done.</p>
<p>I kind of feel like we&rsquo;re all sort of, I don&rsquo;t know, kittens chasing laser pointers for information</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>What do the medieval map makers always write when they had, you know, unknown territory?</p>
<p>Here be dragons.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t help but thinking that there&rsquo;s this area that we&rsquo;re all headed to where here</p>
<p>be dragons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>And what are we when we go through this, you know, calm waters make poor sailors.</p>
<p>Is this like, how is, we know we&rsquo;re going to be different people at the end of all of</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>We know our technology is going to be different.</p>
<p>We know how we consume, what we consume, how we live is all going to be different.</p>
<p>How are we going to be different people?</p>
<p>My gut on it, Dan, is to say that we&rsquo;ll all understand how interrelated we all are from</p>
<p>person to person and also person to nature.</p>
<p>You know, you look at the tree outside your window and you realize, oh, hang on a second</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>Now that I really had to think about my health for the last 12 months, maybe now I do understand</p>
<p>that half my lungs are hanging in that tree.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that we have more of an appreciation how everything is joined, how everything is</p>
<p>linked.</p>
<p>But again, I don&rsquo;t know, because here be dragons.</p>
<p>We did a show a long time ago now, old style, hardcore history, short light by modern standards</p>
<p>where we talked about the Great Depression.</p>
<p>And there was a quote that we used by a New York Times economic writer, Robert Samuelson,</p>
<p>and the gist of it was that we make fun these days or economic experts make fun these days</p>
<p>of the stupid, silly mistakes that the money experts back in the great before the Great</p>
<p>Depression era made, right?</p>
<p>Laugh at their stupidity and their naivete of markets and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But his point was, before you get too haughty about it, realize they were doing the best</p>
<p>that they could with what they knew at the time.</p>
<p>And they got blindsided by something they didn&rsquo;t see or know about.</p>
<p>And that can always happen again.</p>
<p>And of course, before Samuelson, after Samuelson said it, we got hit by the dotcom crash and</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>The point being that it&rsquo;s always something that you can&rsquo;t see coming that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>get you because if you can see it coming and you could plan for it, you know, it&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>less likely to hurt you.</p>
<p>But those things are reliably out there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the black swan idea, right, that you don&rsquo;t know that something&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>But you can imagine that something out there that you can&rsquo;t plan for is going to hit you.</p>
<p>So like you said, and God laughs, right?</p>
<p>So you see, that&rsquo;s what your idea about the fragility and all that sort of stuff comes</p>
<p>into play.</p>
<p>Also, when you&rsquo;re talking about excess hospital beds, the excess hospital beds are not there</p>
<p>for no reason.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re there in case.</p>
<p>So when you say changing us, that right there might be an example of how it changes us in</p>
<p>the same way that the headstrong rush towards business moving forward might get slowed by</p>
<p>the reality of something like a plague.</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s forward thinking and continual momentum toward the next goal, I think, takes a hit</p>
<p>here where everybody is just forced.</p>
<p>My kids are at home.</p>
<p>My kids have no, they can&rsquo;t do anything but just think about kind of and try not to think</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going on here.</p>
<p>I would make the case that there is some value in thinking about things like this.</p>
<p>And especially if you want to get into stereotypes about generations, you know, always looking</p>
<p>at their phone, five seconds of attention span, never thinking about deep subjects.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re thinking about deep subjects now, if only because it&rsquo;s affecting their</p>
<p>day-to-day existence in a way that just it preempts thinking about other things.</p>
<p>Would I have wished this on us in order to get that benefit?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give the commencement speech at my alma mater in like a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>And the whole point of it is to try to point out that there might be some good sides to</p>
<p>this, but I&rsquo;m not saying I wanted it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not glad your commencement was canceled.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, kids.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s going to be canceled anyway, maybe there are some side benefits.</p>
<p>And to answer your question sort of at the end of it a little bit about, you know, does</p>
<p>it change us?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a chapter in the book and we did a podcast, Do Tough Times Make Tough People.</p>
<p>It sounds like an MMA style phrase, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t mean it that way.</p>
<p>It literally is just the same thing one would wonder about seeing in the animal kingdom</p>
<p>or the plant kingdom or any sort of like life&rsquo;s reaction to adversity.</p>
<p>And I mean, if we&rsquo;re this adaptable species, right, if that&rsquo;s the number one thing we bring</p>
<p>to the table, we don&rsquo;t have sharp teeth.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have long claws.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the we&rsquo;re the smart ones who can adapt like coyotes.</p>
<p>Does adaptation require adversity?</p>
<p>Like you said, if it does, then this is a this is going to be something that helps create</p>
<p>a more formidable generation down the road.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, there&rsquo;s to extend that, you know, there&rsquo;s that there is that feeling that</p>
<p>at the end of all of this, we&rsquo;re going to see in this tough situation who got tough</p>
<p>and who cut the laces on their shoes when the fight was about to start.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s and we talked about, you know, why are we so attracted to these these</p>
<p>brutal dictators?</p>
<p>Why are you so attracted to, you know, the macabre?</p>
<p>Why are you so attracted, you know, to behavior at the fringes of the extremes when you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>you know, a pretty middle of the road kind of person, maybe left leaning, maybe a little</p>
<p>bit of a humanist, a little more understanding.</p>
<p>Someone looks for different looks for similarities instead of differences.</p>
<p>You know, just because you&rsquo;re a pacifist doesn&rsquo;t mean you don&rsquo;t appreciate the value of passing</p>
<p>the fist is something that I&rsquo;ve always maintained.</p>
<p>And I think in this situation here, you know, and other generations have gone through it</p>
<p>before and you&rsquo;re right about you laughing at these, you know, kids playing Fortnite</p>
<p>all the time.</p>
<p>And, you know, the closest thing to a, to a fist fight is a, is a nasty tweet, um, that</p>
<p>they, they send to someone in, in anonymity on a, on a eggshell Twitter feed.</p>
<p>But I think at the end of this, we&rsquo;re gonna, we&rsquo;re gonna find out, you know, whose, whose</p>
<p>spine got hardened, um, through all of this.</p>
<p>And, you know, you&rsquo;re going to find out, I think through all of this, um, who can endure.</p>
<p>Cause I know I keep coming back to this, the Margaret Atwood survival, uh, uh, issue or</p>
<p>the Margaret Atwood, you know, survival aesthetic here, but, um, you know, we&rsquo;re going through</p>
<p>something that is not just physical, but is mental as well.</p>
<p>And already we&rsquo;re seeing people that have, you know, completely abandoned themselves</p>
<p>and everything that they believed in or perhaps prepared for because they want to get back</p>
<p>to normal quickly.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an attractiveness to getting back to normal quickly.</p>
<p>And I all understand, and I understand that all too well.</p>
<p>Um, you walk into the front door of my house, there&rsquo;s a two Kanjis and it&rsquo;s a Japanese saying</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a Taoist saying it says unlearn something daily.</p>
<p>And I really feel that that has that one saying, Dan, more than anything else has helped me</p>
<p>in my life at every single stage unlearn something daily.</p>
<p>And I think if we&rsquo;re going to survive through all of this, and if anyone&rsquo;s going to survive</p>
<p>through all this, I think we need to unlearn things from the past because this is all going</p>
<p>to be different.</p>
<p>Uh, as we mentioned, the media is going to be different.</p>
<p>The way we go shopping is going to be different.</p>
<p>The way we greet each other is added for handshakes.</p>
<p>Everything is going to be different.</p>
<p>And I really think that one of the keys to survival with all of this, if we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to get tough and not cut the laces is to start on learning things as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Being the cynic that I am, I want to know what you mean when you say the people that</p>
<p>are going to survive this, the people, I mean, let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s define the term.</p>
<p>What is a person who doesn&rsquo;t define this or survive this or a society that doesn&rsquo;t survive</p>
<p>this in your mind?</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>Um, I think people that can come out at the end of this and can still have, how do I say</p>
<p>this properly here?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to offend anybody, um, surviving both literally, um, uh, and I also think surviving</p>
<p>and still being able to work within a society, still work within a group of people.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t just have to be immediate.</p>
<p>Um, that can also be online, but still, you know, what did, what did Nietzsche always</p>
<p>say?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a monster, it&rsquo;s important not to become the monster at the same time.</p>
<p>At the end of it, not become the monster.</p>
<p>Um, what&rsquo;s a great Twilight Zone episode, the monsters who do on Maple Street, you know,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s never about the monsters, it&rsquo;s about how we treat each other.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always been a big lesson for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my favorite Twilight episode, Dan.</p>
<p>And when I say survive all of this, you know, survive in the sense that we don&rsquo;t turn on</p>
<p>one another.</p>
<p>You know, we have this ritual in my family now after the day is done, um, our three-year-old</p>
<p>goes to bed and I stay up with my 10-year-old and my eight-year-old and we watch Walking</p>
<p>Dead.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen the Walking Dead series before, so we&rsquo;ve started at episode one and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>now plowing through the fifth season.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I should be showing my 10 and eight-year-olds the Walking Dead.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m going to be on the cover of next month&rsquo;s edition of Today&rsquo;s Parent</p>
<p>Magazine, Dan, but it&rsquo;s a nice tradition that we have.</p>
<p>And the one thing that I&rsquo;ve learned through all of it is the lesson from that Twilight</p>
<p>zone episode, which is it&rsquo;s not about the zombies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about us.</p>
<p>And the greatest threat comes from us.</p>
<p>If we can come out and survive this by that, I mean, if we can still not turn on one another</p>
<p>on the last common sense podcast, you talked a lot about partisanship and what partisanship</p>
<p>is doing to us.</p>
<p>And I, I couldn&rsquo;t agree more, um, with the points that you were making because at the</p>
<p>end of this, if we can&rsquo;t get along, if we can&rsquo;t all survive with one another or come</p>
<p>up with some, and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be like this Matthew Arnold idea of, you know, Elizabethan</p>
<p>England is the absolute model of how things have to be.</p>
<p>We have to come up with this idea of, we have to come up with a way that we can all get</p>
<p>along with one another and not let this tear us apart.</p>
<p>Not let that monster separate us from one another.</p>
<p>I hope that makes sense.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>I think tough times are, are points of a fracture.</p>
<p>In other words, one of two things happens, they bring you closer together and heal some</p>
<p>of those things.</p>
<p>I mean, you have a war and everybody unites, you know, in a common cause and forgets their</p>
<p>partisan differences, for example, or crisis can make the fault lines larger and fracture</p>
<p>them more.</p>
<p>I mean, we see that too.</p>
<p>So, so this could go, things like now could break in a number of different fashions.</p>
<p>When I have conversations with people, people get angry at me after the last common sense</p>
<p>shows a perfect example.</p>
<p>And for those in the history audience, you don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ve done a current events podcast</p>
<p>for longer than they&rsquo;ve been podcasts.</p>
<p>I was doing it when it was a radio show, didn&rsquo;t used to be as hard as it is now because everybody</p>
<p>is so angry that trying to find this ground that Jeff&rsquo;s talking about, where you can actually</p>
<p>try to talk to people who disagree strongly about things with each other and speak to</p>
<p>both of them tends to get the same treatment that a police officer showing up at a domestic</p>
<p>violence quarrel with a drunk couple runs into where they might&rsquo;ve been trying to kill</p>
<p>each other five seconds ago.</p>
<p>But the minute the cop tries to come in and bring peace to the situation, they both turn</p>
<p>on him.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I kind of feel like the cop in the domestic violence situation sometimes,</p>
<p>but moments like now are tests.</p>
<p>And so when you say we have to be able to get along, cause I keep asking myself, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the alternative?</p>
<p>I mean, if you, I tell everybody, regardless of where you are on the political spectrum,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to win now.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where we are.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t think of the now what, then you&rsquo;re planning for some, I don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re planning for a perpetual political war that will continue long after you&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>And what did it get you?</p>
<p>Um, maybe, maybe that&rsquo;s short sighted and you know, but, but at the same time, I&rsquo;m looking</p>
<p>at it now going, um, I&rsquo;d like to save reality a little bit because when you jump off the</p>
<p>edge in terms of, of going off the deep end with say political realities, I mean, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny, we have a plague now in a sense that we haven&rsquo;t seen in a very long time.</p>
<p>What if we started to see political outcomes of the sort that seemed to be the things that</p>
<p>are consigned to your history books, right?</p>
<p>What if all of a sudden those didn&rsquo;t seem so strange and abnormal and out of the blue?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to avoid that, shall we?</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s kind of how I try to think about it.</p>
<p>And that sounds like you.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of people who form what I would consider to be sort of the ballast</p>
<p>of society, these people that might want reform, might want change, might disagree with each</p>
<p>other over specifics, but sure as hell want to keep the boat intact.</p>
<p>What do you, what do you think happens, um, with technology and all of this?</p>
<p>You know, last time we were together in Toronto, we talked a lot about, uh, Marshall McLuhan</p>
<p>and the idea that, you know, technologies have these hidden agendas, you know, they</p>
<p>shape the way, um, they, they shape the user in ways that the user never would have imagined.</p>
<p>You know, we see major events, you know, dictating, you know, what type of media gets</p>
<p>consumed and how it gets consumed.</p>
<p>Not that I want to couch this in wins and losses, but I do wonder what type of media</p>
<p>wins here.</p>
<p>You know, we think of the Vietnam war and we think of television, you know, we think</p>
<p>of, you know, the, uh, the first Iraq war.</p>
<p>And we think of cable news in this situation, Dan, what wins, what comes out of it in your,</p>
<p>in your estimation?</p>
<p>I obviously think a lot about this.</p>
<p>Uh, I, and I consider myself to have a tiny little bit of, of responsibility in making</p>
<p>it worse maybe, uh, because in, in the 1990s, late 1990s, I was working in a company.</p>
<p>I started with some friends and one of the things we were pushing was amateur content.</p>
<p>And one of the ideas behind this was some of how, how the idea of how it was going to</p>
<p>change news.</p>
<p>And I thought it was going to be something for the better.</p>
<p>It was going to be opening up news to all sorts of views and opinions and journalists</p>
<p>and reporters on the ground.</p>
<p>And you didn&rsquo;t have to be, you know, I was a reporter and I was saying you didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to be a reporter to report on a news story.</p>
<p>You just, all you have to do is at the time I was saying, have a tape recorder or a cam</p>
<p>quarter and take it out there and record what&rsquo;s going on around you.</p>
<p>And I thought this is going to democratize news.</p>
<p>But you know, it&rsquo;s funny, it&rsquo;s got me thinking about a lot of things, uh, in, in, in including</p>
<p>something that I&rsquo;m uncomfortable with.</p>
<p>I was thinking the other day, not to jump around, but, but, uh, it&rsquo;s such a multifaceted</p>
<p>issue.</p>
<p>I was wondering about the value of a, um, a shared view of reality, even if the shared</p>
<p>view of reality wasn&rsquo;t true, right?</p>
<p>Is there a vet?</p>
<p>So like if you&rsquo;re having the water cooler discussions and it&rsquo;s 1975 and you&rsquo;re in an</p>
<p>office in Los Angeles, uh, discussing what you read in the news that day, about 85 to</p>
<p>90% of the people around that water cooler are going to accept the same facts, uh, from</p>
<p>the New York times and the Washington post and the, and the, the nightly newscast and</p>
<p>Walter Cronkite or whatever, and all those people, not in 75, but you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Maybe in 75.</p>
<p>Um, but, uh, but, but now a person today might say, well, you know, that was a bunch of BS</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t know what was really going on here and there, and they might be right,</p>
<p>but there was a shared idea that about 85 to 90% of the people had on reality, which</p>
<p>allowed them everything from the ability to debate things to have, I mean, it was</p>
<p>something that passed for truth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Fiat money.</p>
<p>People always tell me, you know, the money you hold in your hand is just paper.</p>
<p>The only thing that matters is how much stock people actually put into it, right?</p>
<p>Cause you believe it.</p>
<p>Well, the same thing was true of reality.</p>
<p>It always is true of reality.</p>
<p>You believe it.</p>
<p>But if 85 or 90% of the people believe on the same reality, you can kind of work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a Fiat currency of its own, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s information Fiat currency.</p>
<p>What we have now though, is nobody believes the same reality.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re into these camps.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all reading different stuff.</p>
<p>And the first thing you say in a discussion with anyone is you question their sources.</p>
<p>Um, this is a democratized news environment, but it&rsquo;s also a democratized truth</p>
<p>environment.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m finding that this is a situation that, um, I&rsquo;m not finding good historical</p>
<p>analogies to use as, um, as guideposts on how something like this might go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating human experiment.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to navigate through it myself.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I remember Jello Biafra, um, once said, don&rsquo;t fear the media, be the media.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s always stuck with me.</p>
<p>And I think that that hits where you live when you&rsquo;re talking about creating</p>
<p>amateur content and democratizing media.</p>
<p>Um, you know, it&rsquo;s interesting when you talk about, you know, look, okay, so</p>
<p>what, you know, where are you?</p>
<p>Are you left wing?</p>
<p>Are you right wing?</p>
<p>You know, what are your media biases?</p>
<p>You know, what&rsquo;s the old, what&rsquo;s the old journalist saying?</p>
<p>If your mother says she loves you get confirmation.</p>
<p>It kind of feels like we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re at that point now, um, with all of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious, um, because you know, that point about having a, you know, if 80% of</p>
<p>people are on the same page about history, about current events, and there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>accepted, um, media, there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s an accepted version of the news that we</p>
<p>all agree upon, then we can have the conversation.</p>
<p>You know, I think that that has, um, that has really done a disservice to</p>
<p>television now because it is demonstrated the limits of that, of that format.</p>
<p>Um, and by how an hour is divided in, in, in TV time, because as you well know, in</p>
<p>every segment you have between six to eight minutes to speak, and unless you.</p>
<p>Go along the same lines as those that have come before with all the basic</p>
<p>assumptions, if you try to paint outside the lines a little bit, you spend the</p>
<p>entire segment trying to explain the premise of your point without actually</p>
<p>ever getting there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think, honestly, and I know that I&rsquo;m saying this on a podcast.</p>
<p>I know that I have a podcast myself as well, but honestly, I see as, as, as far</p>
<p>as the, the big winners through all of this, I think this is going to be, cause</p>
<p>I still believe we live in the golden age of audio.</p>
<p>I think the big winners of all this is going to be podcasts.</p>
<p>I really do.</p>
<p>I think at the end of this, this is where ideas can get, um, can, you know, like a</p>
<p>symphony, you know, the melody can, can rise and can fall and can come back again</p>
<p>and can turn into something else.</p>
<p>And you aren&rsquo;t limited by the authority of time, or you aren&rsquo;t limited by a</p>
<p>certain programming formats.</p>
<p>I think, you know, really at the, at the, uh, to be self-serving here,</p>
<p>considering I do have a pod, I think that this is going to be yet another moment</p>
<p>where podcasts demonstrate that this is the ultimate media to consume right now.</p>
<p>And of course, not all podcasts are created equal.</p>
<p>Uh, not all podcasts are the same.</p>
<p>And yes, I do understand that, you know, right now we look for, you know,</p>
<p>we have these, these biases.</p>
<p>We only want to what&rsquo;s the line.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to hear other people&rsquo;s opinion.</p>
<p>They just want to hear their opinion in different sounding voices.</p>
<p>Um, that&rsquo;s kind of, kind of, kind of where we&rsquo;re at right now.</p>
<p>Um, but I do think that this is the place where, you know, the</p>
<p>revolution will not be televised, right?</p>
<p>The revolution is on podcasts.</p>
<p>And I really do believe that this is going to be another brick in that wall for pods.</p>
<p>I hope this is the hope.</p>
<p>I hope that, um, deep conversation and in-depth, um, looking at things the way,</p>
<p>you know, a lot of podcasters like to do it, by the way.</p>
<p>I mean, when you have a three-hour podcast, you have time to go into</p>
<p>depth on issues, right?</p>
<p>Um, I think that it&rsquo;s a little like vegetables, even to some kids where if</p>
<p>you give them cake long enough, even some of the most anti-broccoli oriented</p>
<p>kids start going, you know, a few carrots might be okay right now.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe, maybe, maybe it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a pendulum swinging</p>
<p>back and forth, or there&rsquo;s always a segment of humanity that craves.</p>
<p>This is the other possibility that we&rsquo;re all created differently.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s always a segment of humanity that craves looking at things</p>
<p>through a different lens, a higher zoom perspective, or a more granular one.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a personality question.</p>
<p>Uh, and so something like that, rather than the five second</p>
<p>quick hit, uh, appeals to them.</p>
<p>I always said one of the great things about podcasting is it is a giant</p>
<p>pie of listening audience size.</p>
<p>And if you appeal to just a tiny little sliver of it, that can still</p>
<p>be a heck of a lot of human beings.</p>
<p>And that allows you to pick some topic that might be extremely</p>
<p>narrow that 90%, you know, 90, uh, Mexican science fiction, comic</p>
<p>books from the 1950s or something.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Uh, but the, the small segment of that slice of the pie that finds</p>
<p>you may be a huge number of people.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all going to be fanatically cult driven like folk because they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been waiting for someone like you their whole lives, you know, I think podcasting</p>
<p>has innate advantages over that.</p>
<p>I also think, and this is just, I find this all the time, you</p>
<p>know, all about this too, Jeff.</p>
<p>And, and by the way, that your insider stuff on the industry is absolutely</p>
<p>dead on and we can go there if you want.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a lot of people in the audience who are</p>
<p>actually in the industry, so they would understand it too.</p>
<p>Um, but I would, I would like to point out that it is, there is a huge</p>
<p>difference between creativity with a large group of people and creativity</p>
<p>with a small group of people or a single individual, you and I were</p>
<p>talking before we started here about how interesting it is to watch all the</p>
<p>late night talk show hosts do their, uh, Corona virus at home versions of</p>
<p>their shows without the lights and the, and the camera angles and the glitz</p>
<p>and the band and the audience and the whole thing, and they look remarkably</p>
<p>like the rest of us, which makes some of the better podcasters who do similar</p>
<p>stuff to them, uh, look that much better by comparison, right?</p>
<p>When you take away all the lights and everybody&rsquo;s equal,</p>
<p>those guys might be funnier.</p>
<p>So, so I think, uh, maybe your point is well taken.</p>
<p>I think there, last time I heard there were 750,000 podcasts.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s really something for everybody.</p>
<p>And what I do love about it, it is, is a natural place for genius talent to be</p>
<p>found, uh, Eddie Murphy, Richard Pryor, uh, any, any people who are like great</p>
<p>talent, uh, Robin Williams, none of those people today would have had anywhere</p>
<p>near as tough of a struggle as they did in their day, because they would just</p>
<p>have to have a podcast and everything else would take care of itself from</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>The tech, the talent would, would move mountains.</p>
<p>You know what, you know, a lot of it is too.</p>
<p>I think Dan, well, first of all, there&rsquo;s going to be a whole new star system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s created through all of this.</p>
<p>You know, once everything is equal, then, okay, it&rsquo;s the best ideas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, the best shows it&rsquo;s the most creative people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most engaging, thoughtful people.</p>
<p>Uh, those are going to be the ones that end up coming out shining, uh, at</p>
<p>the end of all of this.</p>
<p>I think one of the failings of, uh, of media right now is this idea that</p>
<p>everything needs to be multi-platform.</p>
<p>Well, you know, we&rsquo;d love to on-ramp this television show.</p>
<p>How can we repurpose it as well?</p>
<p>Uh, how can we repurpose it as well for radio or for podcast?</p>
<p>And you can tell the difference.</p>
<p>I mean, I know you have all people specifically know the difference when</p>
<p>you are listening to a radio show that&rsquo;s been podcasted versus doing a pod cast.</p>
<p>And even though it&rsquo;s subtle, the difference is huge radio.</p>
<p>And you talked about this on the last common sense and you&rsquo;re bang on this</p>
<p>idea of heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, and yell and scream and choose, you know,</p>
<p>confrontation over conversation that&rsquo;s going to get those people that generally</p>
<p>on their radio will only be listening.</p>
<p>You know, what&rsquo;s the average TSL for a time spent listening for radio listener?</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re lucky six to eight minutes while they&rsquo;re in their car, before they</p>
<p>get out of the car, they do something else.</p>
<p>You just want to capture that one slice.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t work for a podcast that doesn&rsquo;t work at all.</p>
<p>One of the things that I think a lot of people have always appreciated about</p>
<p>other common sense or hardcore history.</p>
<p>And I try to do on every podcast that I&rsquo;m part of is the respect and</p>
<p>acknowledgement that you&rsquo;re broadcasting generally when you&rsquo;re doing a podcast</p>
<p>right into someone&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p>And the last thing that people want to hear in their ears is screaming and</p>
<p>yelling.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think, um, as far as, you know, what&rsquo;s going to be that media</p>
<p>that helps to define this generation after this pandemic is, is all done.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be the medium that chooses conversation and is easy to</p>
<p>listen to.</p>
<p>And to the earlier point has the best ideas, has the most, you know, interesting,</p>
<p>uh, observations and is easy to listen to and doesn&rsquo;t scream at the, uh, uh, at</p>
<p>the listener, you know, radio is generally broadcast into a car.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re still broadcasting to the back seat.</p>
<p>Television is broadcast into a living room, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still that old theater idea of talk to the person in the last row.</p>
<p>Podcasts go right into your brain.</p>
<p>They should be listenable and quiet and not jarring.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve always believed.</p>
<p>Jeff, I&rsquo;m going to try to not assume that this is some sort of passive aggressive</p>
<p>attack on me personally, because I am well known for, for going in a nice low</p>
<p>tone of voice, and then all of a sudden screaming in the ear of the listener.</p>
<p>That is almost like one of my known traditional styles.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to take this as a personal slam against me and my approach to</p>
<p>podcasting, because that&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m known for doing that and just, and listen, this is</p>
<p>a good time to address the issue.</p>
<p>Cause I did, uh, I did, uh, a virtual reality thing, a world war one, uh,</p>
<p>exhibit in Skywalker sound, uh, George Lucas&rsquo;s company did the sound and they</p>
<p>were nice enough to have me up to their facilities in Northern California.</p>
<p>Gave me the grand tour.</p>
<p>I got to meet the staff and, and when I met the staff, one of their real</p>
<p>fantastic, great sound engineers comes up to me and says, I&rsquo;m this big fan.</p>
<p>I really want to tell you how much I love the show.</p>
<p>Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Have you ever thought about using any compression on your voice though?</p>
<p>Cause it just gets, you know, and I got, I came back and if there&rsquo;s a band, I told</p>
<p>him, I said, well, everybody&rsquo;s still talking about the compression issue.</p>
<p>And just so everyone knows in radio, when you&rsquo;re on the air at a traditional</p>
<p>station, they have compression, which is, you know, it squashes your voice</p>
<p>between the highs and the lows.</p>
<p>They have it for all sorts of reasons built right into the soundboard.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s nothing you think about when we got off radio and we</p>
<p>got the freedom of podcasting.</p>
<p>Uh, it, it, it became like Nuke and Jeff, you&rsquo;ll understand this.</p>
<p>It became like new audio colors to paint with all of a sudden, you know, and I</p>
<p>was always in the VU meter red anyway.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I was never, I was never a good boy anyway.</p>
<p>Um, but all of a sudden I had these, you know, with the, with the compression</p>
<p>giving me sort of a light pink or a, or a pale blue, all of a sudden I had dark,</p>
<p>angry blues and bright reds.</p>
<p>And now the, the downside of that is you could clip a little bit with the</p>
<p>software, you could bother people&rsquo;s hearing or whatnot, but the, the ability</p>
<p>to go soft and low and high and loud and mix it all together, those are the tools</p>
<p>of a traditional oral storyteller in any society around the world.</p>
<p>And so, uh, we do some compression, but every time people want to push for more,</p>
<p>I keep thinking I become the, the, um, selfish, uh, PV artist who doesn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>you messing with my most extreme colors in any direction, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a slight, uh, first of all, because one of the great things about</p>
<p>what you do and how you couch all of your podcasts is you do all that.</p>
<p>My, my main point was this wall of sound in radio that we normally get, which is,</p>
<p>you know, scream at people for five or six minutes to capture their attention</p>
<p>and ignore something, which I think is perhaps one of the most important things</p>
<p>in either radio or podcast.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s silence.</p>
<p>You know, what&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s one of the great things that can get people</p>
<p>to lean forward right now?</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Silence is a note, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great, wow.</p>
<p>What a, that&rsquo;s a great way to free.</p>
<p>It is a note.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t make, I didn&rsquo;t make it up.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a musician thing.</p>
<p>I did not make, I&rsquo;m not taking credit for that.</p>
<p>That is, that&rsquo;s a wonderful, I gotta write that down.</p>
<p>Silence is a note, but I mean, it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>When I listened to your podcast, the one thing that I appreciate is that you use</p>
<p>all those different paints and all those different brushes, but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>overwhelming, you know, it, it&rsquo;s well-placed like, listen, there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>wrong with a great scream.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I can take five minutes of it when I&rsquo;m trying to listen to</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s point or trying to, to, to learn something here.</p>
<p>Um, but again, this goes back to part of the early, earlier conversation.</p>
<p>We had to talk about, you know, blooming and brooding, you know, these two things.</p>
<p>Um, what are the Taoists say?</p>
<p>They arise mutually.</p>
<p>Um, that which is, um, explicitly two is implicitly one.</p>
<p>They go together.</p>
<p>So you need both.</p>
<p>Um, I think where a lot of radio tends to go wrong and certainly talk radio, which</p>
<p>is the background that I&rsquo;m from and you&rsquo;re from as well, uh, there&rsquo;s this idea</p>
<p>that we only have them for four minutes, make it loud, make it aggressive, really</p>
<p>grab their attention because they&rsquo;re not going to be in the car long enough to hear</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>And, oh yeah, we&rsquo;ve got to get to traffic and we&rsquo;ve got to get to weather and we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got to get to the stop sets.</p>
<p>Oh, well, I mean, no argument there.</p>
<p>I, as I said, I, I don&rsquo;t really even hold, I don&rsquo;t hold anybody accountable for that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the format.</p>
<p>And within the format, as you said, you&rsquo;ve got, you know, this is what was, and I</p>
<p>always, when, when people ask me about podcasting, I always talk about how</p>
<p>attractive all the creative white space was, because when you come from radio or</p>
<p>television, as you said, at the beginning of our conversation, you have these little</p>
<p>blocks where you can be creative and there&rsquo;s six minutes or four minutes or</p>
<p>eight minutes, and then somebody gives you a podcast and you open up a, and you</p>
<p>look and you, and it&rsquo;s just a giant, big, complete white space.</p>
<p>And, and my whole early career was listeners helping me to understand that that</p>
<p>white space was even less constrained than I thought it was.</p>
<p>I mean, I always say that we, we issued an apology to hardcore history listeners on</p>
<p>the show the first time we went over an hour long, because it just seemed like</p>
<p>some horrible transgression, you know, on their time.</p>
<p>And they would write back and say, and obviously this is the very early years,</p>
<p>but they would write back and say, we have pause buttons.</p>
<p>And this became a way for them to teach me the unlimited size and scope of this</p>
<p>white space that we were working with.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s no limits at all.</p>
<p>And so once you do that, I told years ago, I mean, we were probably into podcasting</p>
<p>only about a year and a half before I turned to somebody and I said, I can never</p>
<p>go back to radio again.</p>
<p>I said, I can never go back to radio again because one, I lose this white space.</p>
<p>And two, how, you know, you know this too, Jeff, every radio station I&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>worked in, you have a map.</p>
<p>And on that map is a, is a bunch of concentric circles emanating from your</p>
<p>transmitter, showing you how far the broadcast signal reaches on a map.</p>
<p>Um, yep.</p>
<p>Podcasting is global.</p>
<p>I mean, it reached North Korea may not hear us, but I mean, if I do a show about</p>
<p>Iran, I&rsquo;m going to get letters from Iranians and emails from Iranians.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, I could go to New York, which is the number one radio station, uh,</p>
<p>market in America.</p>
<p>And it would be like a downgrade in terms of, of, of who could hear me.</p>
<p>So when we talk about podcasting being the better medium in terms of format and what</p>
<p>it gives you in creativity and depth and all those things we talked about, how about</p>
<p>just the old fashioned metrics?</p>
<p>You can reach more people, which is what the advertisers and the radio station owners</p>
<p>and the broadcasters always cared about the most to, you know, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>I was making that point, uh, on a previous podcast a few years ago and, and someone</p>
<p>sent me in, um, an Edward R.</p>
<p>Murrow quote, and it was, it was perfect.</p>
<p>I always love these moments where I get grounded from listeners.</p>
<p>Um, and she said, uh, what was the quote?</p>
<p>Edward, uh, because your voice goes across the world now doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re any</p>
<p>wiser than when it only went to the end of the bar.</p>
<p>It was such a wonderful, such a wonderful, like, oh, wow.</p>
<p>Good for you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got a podcast.</p>
<p>You have people are texting you in and emailing in from Australia and all over</p>
<p>the place in Sweden.</p>
<p>Uh, let&rsquo;s not forget this doesn&rsquo;t make you any smarter.</p>
<p>Uh, it just means your reach is that much longer.</p>
<p>Um, the only, the only other big, um, event sort of historical dividing, uh,</p>
<p>event, Dan, that this generation has gone through was nine 11 and, and, and couched</p>
<p>in the area of, of media and what we&rsquo;re watching and what we&rsquo;re consuming.</p>
<p>I can recall, you know, September 10th, the headline stories were still shark</p>
<p>attacks and then nine 11 happened and somehow sharks stopped attacking people.</p>
<p>But do you remember what the big television shows were pre nine 11 was</p>
<p>travel shows everywhere.</p>
<p>You, every, every time you turned on the television, it was travel, go here, go</p>
<p>there, this fantasy, you know, this wonderful voyage, this exotic play was</p>
<p>all trial and even on radio, you know, a lot of travel shows all, you know,</p>
<p>sponsored in order to, to, to sell you, uh, various trips.</p>
<p>Um, but it was travel shows.</p>
<p>And then after nine 11, it seemed as if Dan, that entire industry, that travel</p>
<p>show industry was over and it all became about home improvement.</p>
<p>People stayed home, people nested, people feathered their nests.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they wanted to do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how they felt.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m too scared to go anywhere right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take care of this little plot of land and this pile of sticks</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve sort of cobbled together here and call a home and try to make it as</p>
<p>nice as possible because the world out there is really scary again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to ask a question.</p>
<p>I have no even remote clue what the answer might be, but what do you think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be interested in at the end of this pandemic, whether it&rsquo;s six months,</p>
<p>12 months, 18 months from now, I mean, I think programmers are all asking</p>
<p>themselves the exact same question.</p>
<p>I, I mean, I, I&rsquo;m pretty sure we&rsquo;ll all take more of an interest in our own</p>
<p>health, um, but I, I, I wonder what, what we&rsquo;re going to be consuming, like,</p>
<p>as far as, you know, people that watch television, listen to podcasts.</p>
<p>What do you think people are going to want?</p>
<p>I mean, they wanted travel shows pre nine 11, but after nine 11, the last</p>
<p>thing they wanted was to travel.</p>
<p>Well, in, in, you know, I might not be a historian, but I can sure hedge like one.</p>
<p>Uh, let me give you some examples of how it might go.</p>
<p>So it kind of depends.</p>
<p>Um, the first big variable is how quickly does this thing go away, right?</p>
<p>So if, if this, uh, if this Corona virus is significantly better in two and a half</p>
<p>months, then this chance of simply trying to bounce back and return to some level</p>
<p>of normalcy seems more likely to me.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the natural human desire is just to get back to the way things</p>
<p>were and forget this ever happened.</p>
<p>But well, one, obviously that&rsquo;s going to be hard to do for people who&rsquo;ve lost</p>
<p>their jobs and businesses that have gone under and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Um, but if it doesn&rsquo;t go away like that, if it goes away more slowly, or if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s several reoccurrences and respikes, say when the weather gets cold</p>
<p>in the Western hemisphere, again, things like that, well, then this is going to</p>
<p>be more of a scattered thing, more of a, no, you&rsquo;re not going to be allowed</p>
<p>to just pretend this never happened.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to really have to make this part of your longterm.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have to build this into your thinking longterm.</p>
<p>Um, you know, you don&rsquo;t, my family is so beset the news.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny with the bet, not to change the subject, but the bad news itself</p>
<p>begins to get to people after a while.</p>
<p>Um, and the way that the media sort of, uh, is always weighted towards</p>
<p>whatever&rsquo;s going to get the most eyeballs, extra, extra read all about it.</p>
<p>The bad news right now is what people are interested in.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re seeing a predominance of disaster.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not out there, but, but it&rsquo;s what people are getting.</p>
<p>And so I think there&rsquo;s this desire for bounce back.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the, the nature of this virus is going to allow for that.</p>
<p>And I think if it doesn&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re going to see the changes that you</p>
<p>were talking about more because we&rsquo;re living in a new world and that you just</p>
<p>have to write.</p>
<p>So like the media thing we were talking before we turned on the recorder about</p>
<p>your new reality, which is like my old reality.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re all just podcasters to me.</p>
<p>Now, all you professional guys, uh, you don&rsquo;t know what you were missing, being</p>
<p>able to work from home in your sweats.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;ll never go back.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll never have you back.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to pay for those free croissants and donuts anymore.</p>
<p>Uh, no insurance, no liability.</p>
<p>You just work from home, Jeff.</p>
<p>And, uh, and I, and I&rsquo;m going to make you work twice as hard.</p>
<p>Um, but I, I think that this is, this is going to be heavily dependent on the way</p>
<p>we come out of this.</p>
<p>Um, I do think, and I always feel this way, but this is sort of, I&rsquo;m a, I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>devil&rsquo;s advocate person.</p>
<p>So when things are good, I&rsquo;m always a doom caster.</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re bad, I&rsquo;m always a silver lining guy.</p>
<p>But this has always been the idea behind the, the, the, uh, there&rsquo;s a capitalistic</p>
<p>idea that when times get crappy like this, um, there&rsquo;s a, you remember Ray</p>
<p>Arcel, the boxing, um, the great boxing trainer, and he had a line.</p>
<p>He said, he said, um, hard times make monkeys eat red peppers.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, it, it was a, it basically, cause monkeys won&rsquo;t eat red peppers</p>
<p>unless they have to, cause they&rsquo;re starving.</p>
<p>So the idea here being that there are going to be a bunch of people that will</p>
<p>find, and I don&rsquo;t mean to sound unicorns and rainbows about it, but this is true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be a bunch of people that find their path to success in life</p>
<p>right now, because they have to, uh, because something that might&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>comfortable and easy is no longer comfortable and easy, and they have</p>
<p>mouths to feed at home or whatever it might be.</p>
<p>Uh, this does not legitimize or make okay, or ameliorate the suffering of</p>
<p>all the other people that don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Uh, but I&rsquo;m suggesting that this is all part of how people individually are</p>
<p>going to respond to their own circumstances and how we respond as a</p>
<p>society is going to depend, to depend in large part about how, how all of us as</p>
<p>individuals do, and that&rsquo;s going to depend in large part about how this damn</p>
<p>virus leaves us or doesn&rsquo;t leave us.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>And I wonder if too, if we start to see and not this, you know, we&rsquo;ve, you</p>
<p>know, uh, Shakespeare, for example, you know, wrote King Lear, um, during a</p>
<p>pandemic, you know, a pox on both your houses, Romeo and Juliet.</p>
<p>I mean, all this type of, of, of speak is all something that William Shakespeare</p>
<p>was, uh, was going through.</p>
<p>And a lot of this great, um, you know, a lot of, uh, a lot of Shakespearean</p>
<p>tragedy was, you know, written, um, uh, in, in the time of a plague.</p>
<p>Um, but I wonder if at the end of this too, or through this, to your point</p>
<p>about people finding out what they should do and, and charting a new path</p>
<p>and discovering more about, about themselves and figuring out where they</p>
<p>should be going and solving that finally.</p>
<p>Um, considering that there are, you know, you can, you know, there are ways</p>
<p>that we live and then there are reasons why we live and now that we&rsquo;re all in</p>
<p>quarantine, um, it&rsquo;s a lot more about music and art and books and paintings</p>
<p>and poems, like we&rsquo;re learning a lot about the arts and perhaps we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>realizing too, that as much as, you know, we chase the dollar every day,</p>
<p>chase the dollar every day.</p>
<p>Um, you can&rsquo;t live without the arts.</p>
<p>And I think people are realizing that this is, you know, one of the reasons</p>
<p>why you stay alive more so, uh, more so than ever.</p>
<p>So I, I do wonder if at the end of all of this, there will be some type of</p>
<p>creative Renaissance because doesn&rsquo;t that normally happen, Dan, when we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all asked to look inside as opposed to just chasing something externally, when</p>
<p>we look inside of ourselves and, you know, realize, you know, what&rsquo;s in our</p>
<p>hearts and what&rsquo;s in our minds and how do we want to express ourselves?</p>
<p>And now we have the time to do it.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t that generally lead to some type of artistic Renaissance?</p>
<p>Oh, my answer on this is going to be multi-pronged because the first thing</p>
<p>is, is yes, I absolutely think that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a great thing.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m, uh, art is one of those things that some people are born</p>
<p>appreciating and some people really learn to appreciate as they grow older.</p>
<p>And I fall into that category more and more and really understanding, uh, well,</p>
<p>first of all, the timeless nature of it.</p>
<p>I mean, Cicero, I think it was, who said, you know, writing is</p>
<p>the only true form of immortality.</p>
<p>Art is a form of chasing immortality of having a piece of you, the artist live</p>
<p>on in some way beyond your mortal existence.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Uh, but, but let me, this is why it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a complicated answer because I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want us to, to smudge or besmirch the purity of creative art with money and</p>
<p>finances and personal gain and all that.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d like to point out, and this is something that I tell college students.</p>
<p>I have two children who lean toward the creative rather than the engineering</p>
<p>side of the temperament also.</p>
<p>And what I try to point out is when I was a kid, everybody would try to talk you</p>
<p>out of the creative pursuits because you thought you were going to be waiting</p>
<p>tables at some restaurant and that was going to be the end of your life.</p>
<p>And you were going to be, you know, you&rsquo;re gonna be on welfare because</p>
<p>you, you spent all your time with a theater degree from some school.</p>
<p>But, but I try to explain to my kids now, look at the enormous amounts of</p>
<p>money that people who create in the entertainment world get, I mean, I</p>
<p>always say JK Rowling, look at how&rsquo;s that for a good idea?</p>
<p>How many people have made the living of their entire lives off her idea?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the power.</p>
<p>I mean, Jay Tolkien, look at all the, now I&rsquo;m picking individual, but, but this</p>
<p>is what I say, if you are creative, that is ground zero for everything.</p>
<p>Everybody else in the entertainment world does all the lawyers, all the</p>
<p>attorneys, all the agents, all the cameramen, you know, and, and you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>I had, um, uh, there was a South Park episode once.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going from memory here.</p>
<p>So I hope you&rsquo;ll forgive me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a South Park episode.</p>
<p>It was, it was the making of South Park and they showed you how they made it</p>
<p>and they showed the facilities and they have this place where all the artists</p>
<p>who do it and everything, uh, are playing ping pong and they have a green room</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all, but there&rsquo;s only one guy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s Stone or Parker that comes up with the actual</p>
<p>ideas and because they&rsquo;re on a tight schedule and because it&rsquo;s all out of</p>
<p>his head, nobody can work until he comes up with the idea.</p>
<p>And so the camera follows him around the hallway and you can just see this</p>
<p>look on his face.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve got to have an idea.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to come up with, everybody&rsquo;s waiting for an idea.</p>
<p>And as he passes by the green room, everybody in the green room stops and</p>
<p>looks out in the hallway to go, you know, has he got an idea yet?</p>
<p>Cause nobody can do anything but play ping pong until the guy who is creative</p>
<p>gets the engine humming with the ideas.</p>
<p>And so what I point out is yes, we can all be unpublished poets in our house</p>
<p>with the Corona virus going on and be inspired and that&rsquo;s fabulous and we need</p>
<p>it and it&rsquo;s beautiful and it&rsquo;s artistic and it, many of the greatest artists of</p>
<p>all time fall into that category.</p>
<p>At the same time, let&rsquo;s not pretend that it&rsquo;s not a great way to get ahead in</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>Uh, these days, the people that make the really big money are the showrunners.</p>
<p>You know, those are basically the writers, the people who come up with</p>
<p>these ideas, the people that have, I&rsquo;m going to use the term IP, the</p>
<p>intellectual property, come up with intellectual property, who comes up with</p>
<p>intellectual property?</p>
<p>Do lawyers come up with intellectual property?</p>
<p>Do agents come up with intellectual property?</p>
<p>Do you need all those people?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all creative and they&rsquo;re all wonderful, their jobs, but nobody works</p>
<p>until the South Park guy comes up with the idea.</p>
<p>And so what I always say is the creative people are the genesis of the entire</p>
<p>entertainment industry.</p>
<p>And so to think about it as some job where you&rsquo;re going to be waiting tables and</p>
<p>wasting your college degree to me seems ridiculous.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be out there, JK Rowling, you know, J.R.R.</p>
<p>Tolkiening up the place, right?</p>
<p>And so in my mind, this is a great opportunity for a bunch of people who,</p>
<p>because of their jobs, never had time to sit at home and work on their poetry or</p>
<p>their music or their play that they&rsquo;re writing or their YouTube videos.</p>
<p>I mean, do it now, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great opportunity.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Take advantage.</p>
<p>It might change your life.</p>
<p>You know, I can recall very specifically, do you remember a guy by the name of</p>
<p>Jim Rose, Dan?</p>
<p>Yeah, vaguely.</p>
<p>Who was he again?</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t he like a table guy or something, right?</p>
<p>Jim Rose Circus.</p>
<p>The Jim Rose Circus was that, uh, that, um, uh, then I&rsquo;m not sticking to the same</p>
<p>guy.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So Jim, so Jim Rose was the, um, uh, was the architect of something called the</p>
<p>Jim Rose Circus, uh, toured with Lola Palooza, grunge circus, crazy things, guys</p>
<p>getting darts thrown into their backs.</p>
<p>Um, you know, various piercings, lifting weights from different body parts.</p>
<p>It was like a chaotic circus that you would imagine traveling around with, you</p>
<p>know, Trent Reznor, um, and nine inch nails.</p>
<p>And so when I first started my career in 1994, uh, it was me and my buddies, Bob</p>
<p>Mackwoods and George Trombolopoulos.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re doing a late night show on Friday nights and sports radio, which</p>
<p>had nothing to do with sports.</p>
<p>And we got to spend an entire afternoon with Jim Rose, did an interview with him</p>
<p>one, one and a half hour.</p>
<p>Then Jim and I went out for lunch.</p>
<p>I was a big fan of Jim Rose, still am.</p>
<p>And he said something to me that always stuck with me and there&rsquo;s no right answer</p>
<p>to it, but it&rsquo;s a place that everybody sort of comes into, into conflict.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that, that choice moment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two paths, which way are you going to go?</p>
<p>Um, we&rsquo;re having lunch.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re having a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>And he said to me, so you&rsquo;re just starting your career, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah, but I&rsquo;m not sure about that.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s, if it&rsquo;s going to work out, you know, I still have these, you know, dreams</p>
<p>of, of going back to university, chasing a PhD, who knows?</p>
<p>And he said, well, if you decide to chase this, if you decide to go this media route</p>
<p>or whatever route you take for that matter, realize one thing, as you begin, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be a place in your career where you&rsquo;re going to get to a crossroads that</p>
<p>we all get there, but just be aware that it&rsquo;s coming and here&rsquo;s the crossroads.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to make a decision whether you need to quit or work harder.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no right answer.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no obvious answer.</p>
<p>And you won&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the right answer until many years later, should you</p>
<p>quit or should you work harder?</p>
<p>And I wonder now in this situation where people are forced away from their natural</p>
<p>existences and their natural to further to your point, this is your opportunity to do</p>
<p>this. This is a chance where you don&rsquo;t have to face this dilemma, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two types of freedoms in the world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a freedom, you know, there&rsquo;s a freedom to do anything and there&rsquo;s a freedom</p>
<p>from having to choose to do anything.</p>
<p>And right now we have more of freedom from having to choose to go out and do work.</p>
<p>I wonder if through all of this right now to your last point, Dan, this is the</p>
<p>opportunity where you don&rsquo;t have to face this dilemma of quitting or working harder.</p>
<p>It is wide open for you to your point.</p>
<p>Go for it now.</p>
<p>This might be your best opportunity.</p>
<p>Well, and I can say from a personal side, the hardest thing for me as a younger guy</p>
<p>was when somebody would say, OK, after you&rsquo;ve worked hard all day at your job, right?</p>
<p>I was at KBC in L.A., for example, working on the assignment desk after you worked hard</p>
<p>all day at your job and you come home exhausted, then put time into your side gig.</p>
<p>Right. And I always thought, oh, my God, that&rsquo;s so hard.</p>
<p>I have nothing left and I especially don&rsquo;t have the best of me left.</p>
<p>Right. And so I always found that to be so hard.</p>
<p>This is the opportunity, though, to do that.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re I always said boredom is a wonderful motivator to go do something.</p>
<p>And I always thought that&rsquo;s kind of the problem with the kids that I have.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re never they think they&rsquo;re bored, but they&rsquo;re not bored.</p>
<p>Like we we were like little rascals bored.</p>
<p>Like, you know, I was I was throwing anvils off of my garage door roof onto a onto a</p>
<p>board that I&rsquo;d set up on a fulcrum to imitate something from a cartoon I saw that I</p>
<p>left a dent and a chip that&rsquo;s still in the Toluca Lake sidewalk in front of that house</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t lived in in 40 years because we were so bored.</p>
<p>We were just trying to.</p>
<p>But my point is, from that boredom stems a bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>And I can think of a bunch of things I did throughout all those bored times that I have</p>
<p>a buddy I&rsquo;ve known since I was four years old.</p>
<p>And he said all that crap you were doing when we were kids somehow wove into your</p>
<p>modern life today.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s weird how all that I have nothing to do.</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;ll do this.</p>
<p>And your mind coming up with something from nothing to make this.</p>
<p>So you could be entertained, plays into something down the road.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of bored people right now who are binge watching and doing all these</p>
<p>things. Eventually, they&rsquo;re going to get tired of doing those.</p>
<p>Well, then do something you would do on your side gig time if you weren&rsquo;t so tired</p>
<p>when you got home from work.</p>
<p>Right. What would you do if you had the energy?</p>
<p>Maybe without your job now you have the that sounds awful.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t mean it that way. But but you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>That that from these terrible kinds of limitations we&rsquo;re under now, there are</p>
<p>potential opportunities that some people in lucky situations, right, who aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>caring for a sick loved one, for example.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re sitting around bored, wondering what to do, this might be</p>
<p>something you could take advantage of.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s a better way to put it.</p>
<p>Truth, and I&rsquo;m with you on that one.</p>
<p>And folks, to Dan&rsquo;s point, do it now because the plants are farming us.</p>
<p>They give us oxygen until we decompose and then they consume us.</p>
<p>So you got one shot at doing what&rsquo;s it what&rsquo;s the old saying, Dan?</p>
<p>Everybody is born with two lives and your second life begins when you realize you</p>
<p>only have one.</p>
<p>I think that this is that that moment where we&rsquo;re all starting to get that.</p>
<p>Do you mind if we do a couple of questions from the Toronto show?</p>
<p>No, no, no. We can we can do anything.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t want you to ever feel compelled to do a Q&amp;A type of format.</p>
<p>Please jump in and add or subtract anything you want to after we start talking.</p>
<p>Sure. Well, usually there&rsquo;s a jumping off point.</p>
<p>Okay, well, see, there&rsquo;s so when we did the Toronto show, I get a handful of these</p>
<p>cue cards, and I think we only were able to get to maybe five or six questions for</p>
<p>you, but some of you were awesome there, by the way, I had to just tell the</p>
<p>audience they didn&rsquo;t hear it.</p>
<p>You were awesome there, by the way, the best questioner I&rsquo;ve ever run into ever at</p>
<p>one of these things.</p>
<p>Oh, I have you fooled, Dan.</p>
<p>I thought you were so much smarter than that.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll take the prove me wrong, Jeff.</p>
<p>Prove me wrong.</p>
<p>That was a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Like when I&rsquo;m going to look back on this on this year in my career, that was the</p>
<p>highlight going away.</p>
<p>Remember all the audience thinking I was drinking beer throughout the whole thing?</p>
<p>Well, they gave us beer bottles full of water and they had me what I thought was</p>
<p>a beer and I said, oh, no, thanks.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t drink. And they&rsquo;re like, oh, no, this is why they like Heineken bottles.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re like Heineken bottles full of water.</p>
<p>And I was like, OK, these two guys are getting are getting pickled up there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few questions that I wanted to that, you know, I drive home and I get</p>
<p>back to my office and I pull these out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh, you know what?</p>
<p>I wish I would have looked through these.</p>
<p>I wish I would have looked through these a little more closely because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some really good ones here.</p>
<p>So if you don&rsquo;t mind, Mr.</p>
<p>Carlin, I would like to interview you on your podcast.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>It was your idea.</p>
<p>Let the audience know you you&rsquo;re the one who came up with this plan.</p>
<p>I just sent Dan a text saying, hey, you know, it&rsquo;d be really cool if you just</p>
<p>grabbed a bunch of questions from Twitter and did a Q&amp;A on your own podcast.</p>
<p>So here we go.</p>
<p>This one going back to the Toronto event from Sean.</p>
<p>You tell it in a dramatic, captivating and succinct way.</p>
<p>Whom and what experiences do you credit as influencers of your style?</p>
<p>I got lucky because the times changed on me.</p>
<p>I have a vivid memory of</p>
<p>a radio station I worked at and meeting my boss at the urinal, you know, when I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like on a break, the show&rsquo;s in a commercial run to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>The boss walks right next to me.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s that awkward silence for a minute, you know, never see the</p>
<p>boss and here I am within here and I&rsquo;ve got to get back upstairs before the</p>
<p>breaks over and all of a sudden out of the out of the silence as we&rsquo;re both</p>
<p>standing there looking up, he says, ever thought about getting your adenoids out?</p>
<p>Um, because, because those were the days when you wanted to have the big Gary</p>
<p>Owens voice, you know, the whole wall and everybody sounded the same and I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t sound like that.</p>
<p>Um, so in the time that I was doing radio, the desirable sound of, of a male</p>
<p>broadcaster&rsquo;s voice changed.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden it wasn&rsquo;t about all sounding the same.</p>
<p>It was about all sounding distinctively individual.</p>
<p>And I was already there, right?</p>
<p>I was the guy who needed his adenoids out.</p>
<p>Well, fast forward, you know, uh, uh, getting older, uh, whiskey, everything</p>
<p>else that comes with age and, and my brain slowing down and I just sound like</p>
<p>a, a less speedy, uh, uh, probably less smart, certainly less quick, uh,</p>
<p>a lower voiced version of myself.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t a style that developed.</p>
<p>This is just how I talk.</p>
<p>And luckily the industry came around and made it okay for me to talk</p>
<p>this way without surgery.</p>
<p>You know, there was a, um, you know, mentioning, you know, having a, a</p>
<p>squirt beside a program director.</p>
<p>We used to do this segment on this old show that, uh, that I just referenced</p>
<p>with, uh, with Strombo and Mako, uh, called celebrities I&rsquo;ve urinated next</p>
<p>to, and the most famous person for me, the most, it was, it was late at night</p>
<p>at a, uh, a club down a bar downtown Toronto called Bistro 990 during the</p>
<p>film festivals, like three 30 or four o&rsquo;clock in the morning and a very</p>
<p>inebriated Sean Connery pulled up next to me.</p>
<p>So that was my big celebrity.</p>
<p>Do, do you have one Dan Carlin, the most famous person</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve urinated next to?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t think it was most famous, but it was certainly</p>
<p>most cringe worthy response on my part.</p>
<p>Um, so I&rsquo;m one of these people.</p>
<p>I was, I was born in a family, uh, where, you know, you ran into famous</p>
<p>people pretty often, and so normally I&rsquo;m pretty good about not losing</p>
<p>my mind or anything like that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s always a few people, right?</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s got, it doesn&rsquo;t matter who you are.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s got a few people where you just lose it.</p>
<p>Uh, and I was, uh, when I was a kid, I was a baseball fan and for some</p>
<p>reason that is absolutely, I have no connection to the city.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it ever happened.</p>
<p>I was a Baltimore Orioles fan in the 1970s when, when, you know, it was</p>
<p>those great teams and everybody else in the, and the pitcher I liked</p>
<p>so much was Jim Palmer, um, you know, who does a, yeah, he does a great,</p>
<p>great, uh, job broadcasting everything today.</p>
<p>And when I was a kid, uh, my stepdad who was in radio also got me on the</p>
<p>field to meet all these guys.</p>
<p>I got, I was totally mute.</p>
<p>I mean, I was stunned.</p>
<p>And he said, I&rsquo;ve never heard you not talk for like two hours.</p>
<p>I just, I couldn&rsquo;t even speak around these people.</p>
<p>So I got all their autographs.</p>
<p>I was about 10 or 11 years old or something.</p>
<p>So fast forward, I&rsquo;m working at ABC and they have those morning that the</p>
<p>cheesy, well, I guess they&rsquo;re not cheesy.</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t even say they&rsquo;re cheesy, but you know, they had those local</p>
<p>LA morning shows with, you know, Tawny Little and Steve, uh, whatever his</p>
<p>name was.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;d have those guys and they&rsquo;d always have, you know, uh, Evander</p>
<p>Holyfield is on or, or, uh, and you know, all the morning stars or whatever.</p>
<p>So one day they have Jim Palmer on, but I didn&rsquo;t know it.</p>
<p>Um, but I walked into the bathroom down there, got myself a croissant or</p>
<p>something off their set, walked into the bathroom down there and Jim Palmer</p>
<p>walks up right next to me at the urinal.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what I was thinking.</p>
<p>Cause there can&rsquo;t be a more inappropriate time.</p>
<p>Maybe like when they&rsquo;re going into surgery is worse.</p>
<p>Uh, but, but there can&rsquo;t be a more inappropriate time to say something like,</p>
<p>Hey, by the way, you know, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>And, and, uh, and I, you know, I want to say to his credit, he was awesome</p>
<p>about it, but he wasn&rsquo;t happy.</p>
<p>Uh, and, and I understand it totally.</p>
<p>He was like, really?</p>
<p>It was something like that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really, you would do this now.</p>
<p>And I was kind of thinking to myself later, I don&rsquo;t know, but now even, you</p>
<p>know, I always say I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m not famous, Jeff, unless I&rsquo;m at an event that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s there specifically for me.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I have no, no ability to know how to behave, uh, in those situations.</p>
<p>So I, I did a speaking engagement once at Stanford and I was there like 15 minutes</p>
<p>early and I said, um, is there a place I can get some coffee?</p>
<p>And they said, Oh yeah, the Stanford place where coffee is right,</p>
<p>right around the corner.</p>
<p>So I go there not thinking at all.</p>
<p>I walk in and the entire place freezes.</p>
<p>And it took me a minute to realize that every single person that was going to see</p>
<p>me 15 minutes from now was in that coffee place waiting for the thing to start.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d walked into one of the few places in the entire world where I was famous</p>
<p>and it got, and it got, and it got weird right away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bizarre right away.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not that people aren&rsquo;t cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that I don&rsquo;t know how to behave.</p>
<p>Do you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m uncomfortable with them being so glad to be around me.</p>
<p>You got to treat me more like my wife and kids treat me a certain level of</p>
<p>disdain and, and, and, uh, and impatience and, and rolling of your eyes for me to</p>
<p>be comfortable, people being nice.</p>
<p>And I just, but, but it&rsquo;s funny because it&rsquo;s that same sort of thing where you go,</p>
<p>God, I just, if somebody had come up to me in the urinal next to me,</p>
<p>would I have even been as nice as Jim Palmer?</p>
<p>But you know what though, at that, at that event that we did at the, uh,</p>
<p>the hot dogs theater, the Ted Rogers theater, I mean,</p>
<p>you were like Beatles come to America when, when they got off the plane,</p>
<p>like the places sold out.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a huge lineup for books afterwards.</p>
<p>And you know, a couple of people, uh, on the way out, you know,</p>
<p>just sort of turned to me and said, I can&rsquo;t believe how, you know,</p>
<p>gracious and nice and genuine, like to every single person.</p>
<p>I get a lot of these, a lot of these events, you know, just grab the stamp</p>
<p>and Dan Carlin, Dan Carlin, thanks for coming, Dan Carlin, thanks for coming.</p>
<p>But I mean, Dan, you stayed and talked to everybody and then the next event was</p>
<p>coming on and you took everybody out in the lobby to talk with them some</p>
<p>more and sign more books.</p>
<p>Like, was that an, I don&rsquo;t want to say overwhelming, but was that a unique</p>
<p>experience for you, that packed house in Toronto?</p>
<p>Were you ready for something like that?</p>
<p>They may be a, an honorary Canadian citizen, you know, that day, just so</p>
<p>you know, and they said it was because of all the apologies I made on stage.</p>
<p>They said that, that obviously I have Canadian blood.</p>
<p>Um, here&rsquo;s the way I looked at it, to be honest, Jeff, I feel like those</p>
<p>people see normally, normally I&rsquo;m a person, uh, that you don&rsquo;t have to pay to</p>
<p>hear, uh, my shows.</p>
<p>I mean, we, we obviously after several years put the archives in a paid area,</p>
<p>but I mean, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m a free guy.</p>
<p>Uh, so I don&rsquo;t owe you anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re listening, but I mean, you didn&rsquo;t have to pay anything.</p>
<p>Normally I don&rsquo;t have to worry about that.</p>
<p>So, so the Toronto event that we went to was a paid event.</p>
<p>Uh, I don&rsquo;t do those really.</p>
<p>And so these people paid money to come and see me.</p>
<p>And I just sort of felt, you feel a little guilty about that.</p>
<p>Cause normally I&rsquo;d be fine.</p>
<p>I mean, the podcast is the equivalent of walking in there on stage and just</p>
<p>letting anybody come in and sit down.</p>
<p>And, and then if they don&rsquo;t like it or if they want to leave or whatever, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel sort of beholden to them to the same degree I do if they plunk down</p>
<p>12 bucks or whatever it was.</p>
<p>Um, so I feel like I, I, I felt a real sense of, um, uh, well, both camaraderie</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s weird to, uh, as a podcaster when you, and you know</p>
<p>this too, when you speak into a microphone, you don&rsquo;t see the people on</p>
<p>the other end and it is always, it is always, um, I&rsquo;m not sure what the word</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure the adjective quickly springs to mind.</p>
<p>It is an interesting and unique experience to all of a sudden have all</p>
<p>these people that you have a relationship with, but you&rsquo;ve never met together.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>You do understand.</p>
<p>I mean, you get this as much as anybody else who does pod.</p>
<p>I mean, those are one-on-one relationships that you are creating.</p>
<p>Now, as we talked about earlier, radio, you&rsquo;re broadcasting into a car,</p>
<p>television, you&rsquo;re broadcasting into a living room full of people.</p>
<p>But podcasts, like, I don&rsquo;t know how many times that you have ever said,</p>
<p>cause I know the number for me is zero.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve ever said, Hey, come on, let&rsquo;s all listen to a podcast together.</p>
<p>Like it is a real intimate bond that you form with people, you know, especially</p>
<p>when you have something as compelling as you present in either hardcore or common</p>
<p>sense, like that is a real, like none of that surprised me.</p>
<p>Like when I, when, um, when Harper Collins called me and said, Hey, would</p>
<p>you like to, we understand you&rsquo;re a big Dan Carlin fan, would you like to host</p>
<p>this event?</p>
<p>I was like, I hope it&rsquo;s a big theater.</p>
<p>Cause I know how popular this guy is.</p>
<p>And I know how much people love him.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a real intimate relationship you make in this medium.</p>
<p>You know what, can I circle back to something we talked about earlier when</p>
<p>we were talking about people, maybe at home, maybe working on some creative</p>
<p>idea, not sure what they want to do and all these kinds of things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to sound like something out of some pep talk, um, you know, Tony</p>
<p>Robbins, you can do it video, but to hear you say that Jeff, and to have come from</p>
<p>a place where, like you said earlier, when you&rsquo;re talking about the Trent</p>
<p>Reznor advice or whatever it was, where it was like, uh, you know, where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a time where you go, am I doing the right thing?</p>
<p>Should I continue to do this?</p>
<p>And now looking back on it, saying, you know, having Jeff say that I&rsquo;m going,</p>
<p>wow, you know, uh, what if I hadn&rsquo;t stayed and done what I did?</p>
<p>I mean, I think when you get to the end of your life, whether you&rsquo;re happy with</p>
<p>your life or not happy with your life or, or have mixed feelings about it, I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s normal for a lot of people to look back at it and go, what if, right?</p>
<p>And a lot of times it&rsquo;s what if I made a better decision somewhere, but I mean,</p>
<p>what if I made a worse decision somewhere?</p>
<p>What if I didn&rsquo;t do this?</p>
<p>Or what if I, what if I had all these same qualities, but lived in a time period</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t conducive to podcasting, right?</p>
<p>What if it&rsquo;s 30 years ago or 40 years ago?</p>
<p>So to hear you say that, um, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a unique feeling.</p>
<p>I always say that, that, um, you know, when you get to be my age, I&rsquo;m 54 now,</p>
<p>you see a lot of people who, you know, whose dreams have not panned out, whose</p>
<p>lives have not gone the way that they would have hoped.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of regret that creeps into some people in older age.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have that, you just feel so fortunate.</p>
<p>And you look around and you say, well, why do I not have that?</p>
<p>And a huge part of the reason why are those people that showed up to the</p>
<p>show in Toronto, uh, the people that listened to the podcast.</p>
<p>I mean, I tell them all the time and it must sound like some sort of just, you</p>
<p>know, thing you say at the end of the show.</p>
<p>Uh, but if not for the collective audience and much more than say a big</p>
<p>broadcast network or something like that, if not for the audience, my whole</p>
<p>life is different and not in a good way.</p>
<p>So, uh, I think about it a lot actually.</p>
<p>And, and so the relationship between the audiences, I may be speaking in their</p>
<p>ear and I might have a personal relationship with them, but the reason I</p>
<p>stay afterwards and I would have stayed afterwards at that show, whether or not</p>
<p>they plunked down the 12 bucks is because I&rsquo;m aware every day that this</p>
<p>life I have is because of them.</p>
<p>It sounds cliche, but it&rsquo;s literally true.</p>
<p>I mean, we, we exist on donations and people who buy the old shows.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t get any more personal and connected than that.</p>
<p>There is a real freedom to that too.</p>
<p>I know it, it tends to be harder work.</p>
<p>Like I work for Rogers, you know, a major communications company.</p>
<p>Um, and, and you&rsquo;re one of the great independents and there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>different and harder work that comes a lot that comes along with it.</p>
<p>Could you ever see yourself not as an independent?</p>
<p>Well, the first thing I&rsquo;d like to point out is that I&rsquo;m not good at a lot of</p>
<p>the other stuff that comes with being an independent.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a couple of ways you can go.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people always want to know about the business, uh, that I</p>
<p>operate here and, and there&rsquo;s a, I could have gone the route where you hire a</p>
<p>lot of people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of work to be done, but if you do that, you become a people</p>
<p>manager and I&rsquo;m not good at that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m what I&rsquo;m doing here now.</p>
<p>See, this is what the great, this is the great thing of working for say a radio</p>
<p>station or a broadcast outlet.</p>
<p>They do all that stuff for you, right?</p>
<p>They sell the airtime.</p>
<p>They promote the show.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the infrastructure and you get to be the tip of the spear that just</p>
<p>focuses on what you do.</p>
<p>If the infrastructure is not there, you have to provide it and you have to</p>
<p>provide it by hiring people to do it.</p>
<p>In which case you&rsquo;re the boss of a bunch of people or doing it yourself.</p>
<p>A financial advisor told me a while back that we&rsquo;re leaving a lot of money on</p>
<p>the table.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s no doubt we&rsquo;re leaving a lot, but I mean, in order to get that</p>
<p>money, the things we would have to do would destroy the creative side of what</p>
<p>we do here, which is what&rsquo;s both what we enjoy and what makes it good on the</p>
<p>listener&rsquo;s end of it.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So you say to yourself, uh, I&rsquo;m not going to make as much, I mean, listen, we</p>
<p>could do a lot of ads, uh, but I think it spoils, you know, some of the, the</p>
<p>quality of the experience, you know?</p>
<p>So, I mean, I feel like, um, what, what&rsquo;s the question again, bring it back to</p>
<p>the point for me here.</p>
<p>Jeff, we talked about this in Toronto.</p>
<p>Remember?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We, we talked about, you know, could you, could you see yourself existing as</p>
<p>anything outside of an independent?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, uh, well, listen, the one, the one thing that, that, um, that I&rsquo;ve gotten</p>
<p>out of practice of is, and I started to talk about this earlier and I got off on</p>
<p>a tangent where we were talking about, uh, collective creative work versus</p>
<p>individual creative work when I was starting to talk about the South Park</p>
<p>guys and stuff.</p>
<p>Um, you know, if you&rsquo;re Jimmy Kimmel or, or, or whatnot, uh, you&rsquo;ve got a whole</p>
<p>huge staff of people and you&rsquo;ve got writers and everybody&rsquo;s part of the</p>
<p>creative, uh, contributing staff, right?</p>
<p>Um, so you get sort of a creativity by committee and when it works, you have a</p>
<p>Seinfeld, right?</p>
<p>Or something really magical.</p>
<p>Um, but I find that when I do creativity by committee, me being the persnickety,</p>
<p>very specifically weird person I am, I like it less than when it&rsquo;s my own baby</p>
<p>sort of.</p>
<p>And so being an independent allows me to not have to do anything I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>do.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t, we make no allowances at all for anything for, I mean, at this</p>
<p>point, this is the wonderful, you know, we talked about regrets earlier.</p>
<p>The wonderful part of my life now is to be able to sit here and go, I don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>about any of the, I&rsquo;m going to do the show the way I want to do it.</p>
<p>If I have some, there&rsquo;s just, there&rsquo;s nothing that comes into it other than,</p>
<p>uh, cause I, here&rsquo;s the way we figure it.</p>
<p>We figure that this stuff outlives us, right?</p>
<p>The stuff we&rsquo;re making, the stuff you&rsquo;re putting online, uh, this stuff will be</p>
<p>around longer than we will.</p>
<p>And so we have to live with it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s going to be the best representation of who the hell you were</p>
<p>when you were alive that you could find.</p>
<p>Can you imagine having, um, a podcast of the kind that we do with hardcore</p>
<p>history or common sense from any of the great figures in history centuries and</p>
<p>centuries ago?</p>
<p>Think about how much of their soul would be transmitted.</p>
<p>I mean, Cicero, we said earlier, said that writing&rsquo;s the only true form of</p>
<p>immortality.</p>
<p>Well, think about if it was on YouTube instead.</p>
<p>Think about the other nuances of that guy&rsquo;s personality you&rsquo;d get if you could</p>
<p>see him, hear him.</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a three-dimensional, uh, transmission of one&rsquo;s soul, personality,</p>
<p>and, um, and sort of character.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, I&rsquo;ve often said I feel like my great-grandchildren will get a</p>
<p>chance to have a sense of who I was if they simply listen to these podcasts.</p>
<p>Now, that, that boomerangs back, though, when you&rsquo;re doing them and you think</p>
<p>about, okay, how much should we tweak this or exactly how right does it need</p>
<p>to be before we release it and all this?</p>
<p>Because you have two audiences.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when you&rsquo;re writing a book.</p>
<p>You have an audience if you&rsquo;re serializing it in a magazine, right?</p>
<p>Chapter one in June, chapter two in July, chapter three in August, right?</p>
<p>Uh, you&rsquo;ve got an audience waiting for each of those.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one audience.</p>
<p>But then you have an audience who&rsquo;s not going to find your book for five years,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s not going to have to wait for any of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a different audience.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ve got people waiting on the next show for us that are, you know, when&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>coming out?</p>
<p>When&rsquo;s it coming out?</p>
<p>And so, we&rsquo;re trying to make a good show for them.</p>
<p>But we know that there are going to be people that don&rsquo;t find this for years and</p>
<p>years and years.</p>
<p>And we have to make a show for them, right?</p>
<p>That, that, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, they don&rsquo;t care how long it took five years from now.</p>
<p>They just care how good it is.</p>
<p>So, these are the kind of things we think about.</p>
<p>And to dovetail it with your point about independent versus corporate, can you</p>
<p>imagine going to a giant corporation that invested in this and has a publicity staff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s working in line with their promotional side and, you know, to get this out</p>
<p>of the, you can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t function that way.</p>
<p>And I, and it&rsquo;s not a slam on them.</p>
<p>They have to coordinate the activities of all kinds of people.</p>
<p>I have to coordinate the activities of me.</p>
<p>And it changes how I approach this creatively and how I can make something that</p>
<p>hopefully my grandchildren are happy with, you know?</p>
<p>You know, there was, there is a feeling, and I believe this, that things like music,</p>
<p>for example, where at their most vibrant, when the people that ran the shops didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what they were serving up, when there were the program directors that got a new</p>
<p>album across their desk and said, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe the kids will like it, put it</p>
<p>on there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what happens.</p>
<p>And some of it&rsquo;s crap, as we&rsquo;ve heard before.</p>
<p>But a lot of it is good when you just admit that, well, I don&rsquo;t know, let&rsquo;s just try</p>
<p>something here.</p>
<p>You can, you go back and listen to, I&rsquo;m going to sound like an old guy here.</p>
<p>Oh, everything was better in the, in the olden days.</p>
<p>But if you go back and listen to music in the late sixties, in the early seventies,</p>
<p>like every song, you know, on, on any top 30 list, every song was distinct from the</p>
<p>very next song.</p>
<p>There was, there was a vibration of so many vibrant sounds and different types of music</p>
<p>that made its way onto radio.</p>
<p>It was fantastic.</p>
<p>And then things like, you know, formats got tighter and program directors who thought</p>
<p>they knew what the kids wanted became more of a things and focus testing, which is still</p>
<p>the bane of, of a lot of, uh, of a lot of radio people&rsquo;s, uh, existence.</p>
<p>Um, do you find that you&rsquo;re the kind of person that is more willing to just try things because</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know, or Dan, do you already have this idea of a focus test in your mind before</p>
<p>you put it out?</p>
<p>You know, William Butler Yates, I&rsquo;m one of my favorite poets used to talk about killing</p>
<p>skepticism because in his mind, it was the acknowledgement of a limit.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t want to have that with his art.</p>
<p>Do you feel similar?</p>
<p>Are you the type of person that embraces the let&rsquo;s just try this and see what happens</p>
<p>type vibe?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s one of the reasons the shows take so long.</p>
<p>And, and, uh, one of the things I don&rsquo;t ever want to do is have a template for this.</p>
<p>I mean, once you say you&rsquo;ve got this giant creative white space that we talked about</p>
<p>earlier, and once you acknowledge this is something you really like about the medium,</p>
<p>well, why do anything that then creates your own boxes that you&rsquo;re then constrained by</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Radio used to give you those boxes.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to put your own boxes in there.</p>
<p>So when I try to figure out how to weave a narrative together, one of the things I ask</p>
<p>is, is this something we do all the time?</p>
<p>Or is there a way we could switch that?</p>
<p>Can we tell the end of the story first and then switch it around?</p>
<p>So not only does that keep that fresh from a listener standpoint, it keeps it fresh from</p>
<p>a storyteller standpoint and helps you help.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess I, there was a friend of mine and he&rsquo;s probably going to listen to this</p>
<p>who, who, who described what I do.</p>
<p>Cause, uh, we used to just do this entirely.</p>
<p>Like all my shows, I would walk in and record it and we&rsquo;d be done.</p>
<p>Um, and, and we can&rsquo;t do that with six hour podcast or three hour podcast or whatever.</p>
<p>So we started, um, editing them.</p>
<p>And I always said that one of the things I didn&rsquo;t like about live talk radio was that,</p>
<p>as you know, you&rsquo;re juggling ads and you&rsquo;re juggling news and you&rsquo;re juggling the next</p>
<p>guest and you have to, you have 900 things to think about while the caller is talking</p>
<p>with you, but then you have to live with whatever political statement then comes out of your</p>
<p>mouth over three hours, over 15 hours a week, over all those months.</p>
<p>And I used to say, God, I just would love the, the freedom that an editor has at a newspaper</p>
<p>when they write a column to go, Oh, that&rsquo;s the wrong word there.</p>
<p>Strike that and put the words you really want there so that when, when it goes out to the</p>
<p>public, you can say, I&rsquo;ve signed off on this.</p>
<p>This is really what I meant to say.</p>
<p>And I feel like the way our podcast developed has given me that freedom.</p>
<p>Now, what that does though, is, you know, and you, you know, this, but the audience</p>
<p>maybe doesn&rsquo;t, this is not a scripted program.</p>
<p>So my friend who I was just mentioning had, had described what I do as edited performance</p>
<p>art.</p>
<p>And that kind of is a good way to put it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because we get up, I get up here and I just sort of riff.</p>
<p>I know what I want to say.</p>
<p>Usually if I&rsquo;m, if it&rsquo;s the history show, I have a couple of quotes usually marked that</p>
<p>I want to include.</p>
<p>And then as soon as I run out of steam or it starts falling apart, or we tried some</p>
<p>experiment and it didn&rsquo;t work or it did work, we cut off for the day and then stitch it</p>
<p>to whatever last worked.</p>
<p>And then by the end of it, you have a bunch of improvisational sessions that hopefully,</p>
<p>you know, tell a story in a way that keeps it fresh and moving.</p>
<p>And hopefully if you&rsquo;ve heard a bunch of my shows, doesn&rsquo;t sound like all the other shows,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Has all the things you like from all the other shows, but keeps you guessing in terms of</p>
<p>show design, narrative, the way the story is approached and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So in answer to your question, we experiment all the time and it is one of the things I</p>
<p>like most about the gig.</p>
<p>So let me follow that up then with this question and this audience member didn&rsquo;t put his or</p>
<p>her name on it, but it dovetails your idea about learning.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the old saying?</p>
<p>When one teaches to learn.</p>
<p>Dan, what podcast did you learn the most from?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tough one for me for two reasons.</p>
<p>One, when we started podcasting, there weren&rsquo;t all that many podcasts, 2005, June or July</p>
<p>2005.</p>
<p>The second reason why is I don&rsquo;t listen to much in the way of podcasting because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>a reader.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what I, that&rsquo;s my medium.</p>
<p>And in part because of the speed at which I read.</p>
<p>So conversation often goes too slowly for me.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have a, I live in a place where I don&rsquo;t have this long commute.</p>
<p>So my lifestyle isn&rsquo;t conducive to lots of radio or broadcasting.</p>
<p>So the podcasting answer is going to be more.</p>
<p>I mean, the podcasts that we learned from in 2005 were the, I mean, Adam Curry had the</p>
<p>daily source code.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s an example when you would listen to go, well, what the hell is Adam Curry</p>
<p>doing?</p>
<p>I mean, so, but at this stage we were at, you weren&rsquo;t sitting there trying to pick up</p>
<p>little tricks.</p>
<p>You were sitting there going, uh, now does he have an email linked to this on a webpage?</p>
<p>I mean, it was really, really basic stuff you were trying to learn.</p>
<p>Um, I remember when people were trying to figure out how to ask for donations and that</p>
<p>kind of stuff, we would look at what other podcasters were doing and say, okay, did they</p>
<p>put a note on their front page or are they running ads in their shows?</p>
<p>And so it was more trying to get a sense of where the industry was and where trends were</p>
<p>moving rather than, oh, this host had an approach I like, or, uh, I liked the way that that</p>
<p>show did intro music.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel like in a lot of ways, everything from, uh, the imaging to the branding to the</p>
<p>show announcer, the, the, the buffered, I mean, all the, I think we, you know, hoping</p>
<p>in a non-arrogant way, but I think we introduced some standards on those things that hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>been around before.</p>
<p>I mean, we brought a big voice in a friend of mine I&rsquo;ve worked with for many years, the</p>
<p>great Bill Barrett.</p>
<p>Um, and all of a sudden, you know, podcasting sounded like your radio show.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean we invented that, but that was one of the things that we just said, okay,</p>
<p>well, we have access to a big voice.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use them.</p>
<p>Um, we named all the episodes.</p>
<p>So instead of a lot of shows, we&rsquo;re just doing numbers when we started, right?</p>
<p>Show number 140.</p>
<p>And, um, the feeling was, is that if you name these shows, it&rsquo;s like a Star Trek episode,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>It gives it a personality and it has, it&rsquo;s not show 127.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trouble for tribbles, you know?</p>
<p>And you go, oh yeah, I know.</p>
<p>So we thought the same thing.</p>
<p>And then the history show was the same sort of deal too, where you turn around, you go,</p>
<p>um, that&rsquo;s the idea behind the artwork with the history shows to our wonderful artist</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s Canadian.</p>
<p>Nick Lay said, um, uh, I think all the shows should have individual artwork for the same</p>
<p>rationale that having an individual name was thought of, right?</p>
<p>It gives them even more of a personality, even more of a, of a standalone sense of,</p>
<p>uh, this is a book, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a podcast where, uh, all the shows are the same.</p>
<p>This is a, this is a, a, a piece of art that is a standalone piece of art.</p>
<p>Uh, and, and I don&rsquo;t mean the art of the cover or the album art.</p>
<p>I mean, the entire package wrapped in the art, right?</p>
<p>The art in the art.</p>
<p>Um, and, and so when you say, what did you learn from other podcasts?</p>
<p>Well, most of what I learned was trying to figure out, and I think they did the same</p>
<p>with me.</p>
<p>We were all watching each other to try to figure out what&rsquo;s everybody doing, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the newest thing, what works, what doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I remember when some guy, I don&rsquo;t remember when it happened.</p>
<p>One of these podcasts tried to make it, uh, was the first guy that tried to make it a</p>
<p>members only thing, or you have to pay for it thing.</p>
<p>And I forgot who it was, but they had a lot of listeners, whatever that time period considered</p>
<p>to be a lot of listeners, because it&rsquo;s probably 2006 or 2007.</p>
<p>And they went like pay and everything dried up instantly.</p>
<p>And I remember they came back and said, okay, rule number one, don&rsquo;t ask him to pay.</p>
<p>But I mean, but nobody knew until somebody tried.</p>
<p>So what I learned most was we were watching this develop and, and, and you didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to have to learn everything by trial and error yourself.</p>
<p>So you kind of watch what everybody else was doing and try to figure out what was adaptable</p>
<p>for you and what wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>A lot of what other people were doing wasn&rsquo;t adaptable for, for our particular style of</p>
<p>stuff.</p>
<p>But, um, but I think everybody watching everybody, that&rsquo;s how, that&rsquo;s how the early industry</p>
<p>sort of moved forward.</p>
<p>Let me follow up with a question about reading.</p>
<p>Cause you talked about that off the top of that answer.</p>
<p>I can recall specifically, cause you know, like you, I was a big reader when I was a</p>
<p>kid, always have been.</p>
<p>I can remember my mom saying to me once, never make fun of anyone who mispronounces a word</p>
<p>because that means they learned it from a book and didn&rsquo;t just hear it.</p>
<p>And we should be encouraging more people to read.</p>
<p>How do you talk to your kids about reading?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, that, that&rsquo;s the kind of statement I can completely, um, get behind.</p>
<p>Cause you know, when I mispronounce words, that&rsquo;s why I mispronounce them.</p>
<p>Thank God, the audio pronunciations online are getting so much better.</p>
<p>Uh, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s easier to work with.</p>
<p>I, it&rsquo;s funny too, cause Jeff, I always get these wonderful offers from people all around</p>
<p>the world to help me with pronunciation.</p>
<p>If I ever am in, am dealing with anything from their neck of the woods, but, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny cause you go, oh, you know, I had that Japanese guy five years ago who told me he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>helped me.</p>
<p>You do what are you going to do?</p>
<p>Find the email, look the guy.</p>
<p>It just isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So, so thank God for the audio pronunciation things because that, that&rsquo;s been a, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been difficult for a lot of history show people, uh, over time.</p>
<p>Um, how do I teach my kids about reading?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tough one because, um, I happen to be a person who probably, uh, assumes some</p>
<p>level of magical power comes from reading.</p>
<p>I do think that, that, that statement in the, um, in the world of the blind, the one eyed</p>
<p>man is King.</p>
<p>I do think that as less people do things, the people who still do those things become</p>
<p>more valuable.</p>
<p>There was an interesting book out, uh, head in the cloud.</p>
<p>I think it was called something like that, where the author was talking about how important</p>
<p>it is to still know things, even in the era where everything is look up a bull.</p>
<p>Uh, and in part, because you don&rsquo;t know what you don&rsquo;t know, uh, the reading is the same</p>
<p>thing where, um, I think, and I talked to a guy who said, cause he knew I was a big</p>
<p>reader.</p>
<p>And he said, can&rsquo;t you just get everything a college can give you from reading it yourself?</p>
<p>And I said, yes and no, you don&rsquo;t know what you don&rsquo;t want to read though.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know what you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what sometimes the professors are there to guide you, right?</p>
<p>If they said here, make sure you read this.</p>
<p>Well then maybe yes, but if you&rsquo;re just reading, what&rsquo;s interesting to you, you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>find that your knowledge is, is somehow limited by that, right?</p>
<p>Your choices on what you find interesting has determined the parameters of what you</p>
<p>know.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t learn what you didn&rsquo;t want to know.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s skewed your image.</p>
<p>So when I look at my kids, I&rsquo;m trying to figure out how much the term reading applies to what</p>
<p>they do now.</p>
<p>So when you say reading, are we talking about the greats or are we talking about they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on the iPad and they&rsquo;re, you know, I mean, so I think we have to define, are we talking</p>
<p>about the, what they&rsquo;re not getting with the great pieces of literature or the ancient</p>
<p>classic scholars, or do you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s all kinds of reading, there&rsquo;s trashy novels and there&rsquo;s Steinbeck,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And do you get the same from both of them?</p>
<p>So, um, I think all the kids today read a lot.</p>
<p>They just are reading little snippets here or there on, on, in a, in a digital format.</p>
<p>The question is, is that, is that giving them the benefits that we always associated with?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m using air quotes with my fingers reading.</p>
<p>Is there enough water to the village?</p>
<p>If you do it that way is what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, look, if I&rsquo;m reading, uh, if I&rsquo;m reading a digital piece on TMZ right now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading, uh, but did it, did it improve, uh, did it provide any of the qualities we</p>
<p>associate with bettering us as human beings that, you know, when I was a kid, they say,</p>
<p>you know, readers, this and readers that, well, what if I&rsquo;m reading the national inquirer?</p>
<p>See, from my, I mean, my kids are 10, uh, 10, eight and three.</p>
<p>So we try to encourage things that encourage the kids to ask questions.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;ll always, okay, so sit down and read and then we&rsquo;ll sit and talk to them about it</p>
<p>and ask them about the questions just to sort of trigger the idea of a questioning things</p>
<p>that you read, finding things that are interesting.</p>
<p>Um, cause that&rsquo;s what I always did when I was a kid feeling that eventually that type</p>
<p>of curiosity in reading will lead to all those things that you talk about.</p>
<p>Eventually, if you can understand that, you know, through, you know, even just, you know,</p>
<p>reading a book about like right now, my kids are, what are they reading now?</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re reading the walking dead, you know, graphic novel series, but they have</p>
<p>a million questions about them and they&rsquo;ll come to us with like ethical questions about</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>And although you can&rsquo;t talk to your kid about utilitarianism when they&rsquo;re eight years old,</p>
<p>those same questions still do exist.</p>
<p>So for us, as long as they&rsquo;re still asking questions based on what they&rsquo;re reading,</p>
<p>then I think they&rsquo;re heading in the right direction.</p>
<p>I always try when I&rsquo;m talking about education reform to, to, to focus on taking what the</p>
<p>child&rsquo;s already interested in and then trying to figure out a way to help them distill value</p>
<p>based on what they already find interesting.</p>
<p>So for example, um, I have a daughter who&rsquo;s not going to like any of those kinds of, who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not going to get into those kinds of questions with you, but she&rsquo;s going to be very interested</p>
<p>in the way a story is told.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s got a very good head for story development and how the pieces fit together, right?</p>
<p>Some of the stuff we just talked about with how I like to try to switch it up with our</p>
<p>show.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s got a very good sense of that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s when we read, I break the stories down that way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say, well, do you see how the author tried to tell this story this way?</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;ll say, yeah, but they could have done this also.</p>
<p>And so she&rsquo;s not necessarily getting, she might not be absorbing whatever the message</p>
<p>that the writer was trying to get to her was.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s more absorbing the way that the writer, uh, decided to tell the story.</p>
<p>There was a, I read a story about John Belushi once, and I think it was, uh, Lauren Michaels,</p>
<p>uh, the Saturday Night Live, the Canadian Saturday Night Live, um, a producer who was</p>
<p>saying that he was giving John Belushi one of these speeches about cleaning up his act</p>
<p>for his health purposes and all that.</p>
<p>And he goes, but he&rsquo;d already heard that story before.</p>
<p>He says, when you tell a comedian like that, something like that, they&rsquo;re more probably</p>
<p>trying to work out an impression of you and how you raise your eyebrow and how you, how</p>
<p>your voice talks and all that sort of stuff.</p>
<p>Instead of hearing the content of the message.</p>
<p>Well, my daughter wasn&rsquo;t hearing necessarily what that, what that writer was trying to</p>
<p>impart in terms of data and story and information, but she was paying close attention to the</p>
<p>way the eyebrow went up and the tone of the voice and the way the story was told.</p>
<p>So in answer to your question, I try to find out what it is that they&rsquo;re finding appealing</p>
<p>from the work.</p>
<p>And then I try to examine that.</p>
<p>Um, I, I did, I wrote a piece once for Edutopia, which is, um, it&rsquo;s an education reform, uh,</p>
<p>online, uh, resource.</p>
<p>And, and, uh, I didn&rsquo;t want to write it cause a lot of teachers use it and I didn&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>qualified to tell teachers how to teach.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in the classrooms every day.</p>
<p>So I try to just say, um, isn&rsquo;t it silly to teach kids a bunch of things if they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>remember it later?</p>
<p>Because the whole idea behind teaching say names and dates is it&rsquo;s important stuff for</p>
<p>a citizen to know these things, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter if they don&rsquo;t retain that knowledge.</p>
<p>And so I was trying to point out that maybe if you started with the fact that we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>interested in history innately, but just not the same history, you find out what your kid</p>
<p>likes and then you teach them the history of that, right?</p>
<p>They like hockey.</p>
<p>Hockey has a history.</p>
<p>They like fashion.</p>
<p>Fashion has a history.</p>
<p>You can teach how, you know, historical evolution and historical processes and all these things</p>
<p>by sticking with the subject the kid already likes.</p>
<p>And so when we talk about books and my kids, they aren&rsquo;t necessarily getting, you know,</p>
<p>you could say here, read this book, you&rsquo;ll learn a lot kid, but they might learn a lot.</p>
<p>It just might not be what you think they should learn.</p>
<p>So I try to craft, um, what works in the piece with what the child, what resonated with the</p>
<p>kid.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually a follow up, another question here that sort of follows that up.</p>
<p>Again, from someone unknown, they didn&rsquo;t write their name.</p>
<p>Dan, I have a three-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t yet play her your podcast.</p>
<p>What do I do until I can?</p>
<p>How can one gradually or best introduce children to history?</p>
<p>Again, I think this is something that you tailor to the personality of the individual.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we all that&rsquo;s why we all choose.</p>
<p>If you go to a history section at a bookstore, if there are any old brick and mortar bookstores</p>
<p>left or in the future, different people are going to pick different books.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all history, but different.</p>
<p>I mean, for a while, one of my kids was interested in the life of pioneer women on the frontier</p>
<p>in the middle of the United States.</p>
<p>And she was really taken with their stories.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;d read these novels or these pieces that would include a lot of the primary sources</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;d hear, you know, what it was like growing up in little house on the prairie</p>
<p>type situations.</p>
<p>And that resonated with her.</p>
<p>And so you find something you go, well, if you like that, you might like this.</p>
<p>All you&rsquo;re trying to do there is awaken a love of the past.</p>
<p>Again, this is what I said in the education article.</p>
<p>If you can manage to turn that spark on, if you could appetize someone for the love of</p>
<p>history, they still may not know what year Columbus discovered the new world from the</p>
<p>old world, but they will be continually reading historical things, be interested in it.</p>
<p>And they will begin to fill in.</p>
<p>This is what I always hope that you start to fill in broad areas of knowledge.</p>
<p>Oh, before our own time, you had this era.</p>
<p>And then before that era, you had this era.</p>
<p>And so you begin to form a framework for how the broad eras of humanity have fit together.</p>
<p>But you have to do it like a jigsaw puzzle.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re talking about your kids, you start with whatever piece of the puzzle first</p>
<p>is attractive to them.</p>
<p>That is, you know, my parents did that with me in one very specific way, Dan, every year,</p>
<p>at least once or twice.</p>
<p>This is before, obviously, you know, the internet and, you know, they have various books about</p>
<p>hockey, but as a kid, I was always fascinated with hockey, still am to this day.</p>
<p>They would take me to the Hockey Hall of Fame in downtown Toronto and leave me there.</p>
<p>I had a notebook in my little knapsack.</p>
<p>Jeez, Dan, I was eight, nine years old, and I would write everything down.</p>
<p>I would sit there and watch all the videos and make notes.</p>
<p>And I come back with my notebook all filled up with observations and just regurgitation</p>
<p>of facts that I knew about hockey.</p>
<p>And honestly, afterwards, I would start to ask questions about what was happening around</p>
<p>the games that weren&rsquo;t just the games.</p>
<p>Who are these guys?</p>
<p>Where did they go?</p>
<p>What was the circumstance?</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t they play this game?</p>
<p>Why did this person get arrested?</p>
<p>Different things like that.</p>
<p>So I can, from personal experience, that&rsquo;s how my parents did it with me.</p>
<p>Now, maybe they just thought the Hockey Hall of Fame was going to be the world&rsquo;s cheapest</p>
<p>babysitter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but they would just plunk me down at the Hockey Hall of Fame, and I would</p>
<p>stay there the entire day.</p>
<p>I got one more for you.</p>
<p>This is a really interesting one.</p>
<p>Um, how does our tendency to gloss over the carnage gore and unforgivable aspects of</p>
<p>history affect how we interpret our past?</p>
<p>Well, obviously, we do the opposite in the Lord Gore History Program.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t gloss over it.</p>
<p>You know, I think it&rsquo;s an interesting question because I would argue that we don&rsquo;t gloss</p>
<p>over it.</p>
<p>We zoom in and zoom out in a way that gives us quick hits of the nastiness without any</p>
<p>of the long-term contemplation that you would hope comes with it, right?</p>
<p>So if you look at both World Wars, any major events like that, you&rsquo;ll see that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a period of almost like international reflection afterwards, where everyone&rsquo;s trying to absorb</p>
<p>the enormity and the lessons and everything of what just happened because it&rsquo;s so fresh</p>
<p>and so enormous.</p>
<p>I think that there may be almost an evolutionary self-defense mechanism that allows us over</p>
<p>time, if not to forget that, then to not feel it at the same levels of intensity.</p>
<p>I mean, imagine if human beings still felt with the same intensity all of the great traumatic</p>
<p>events of history.</p>
<p>Over a couple generations, it fades, and that may be like a protective measure, right,</p>
<p>to allow us to move forward unburdened by all of the trauma of the collective past.</p>
<p>But of course, it comes with the downside, too, which is without the trauma and without</p>
<p>it being fresh in your mind, that contemplative reform period, that period where you say,</p>
<p>what did we learn from this?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make sure this never happens again.</p>
<p>That fades, too.</p>
<p>I was talking to somebody the other day.</p>
<p>We were talking about a line.</p>
<p>I forgot where I heard it, but it&rsquo;s about the smell of the bodies.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re talking about the concentration camps at the end of the Second World War,</p>
<p>where some of the Allied generals made some of the local Germans from the nearby town</p>
<p>walk around the camp with all the dead bodies out.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s film of this, by the way.</p>
<p>And one of the generals had said something like, you know, I want them to smell the bodies.</p>
<p>I want them to remember the smell of the bodies, something like that.</p>
<p>And so that became almost like a term that you use to say when the smell of the bodies</p>
<p>is fresh, we&rsquo;re in one frame of mind.</p>
<p>But after a couple of generations, when you don&rsquo;t smell the bodies anymore and you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>remember them and you know those people and they&rsquo;re not even real to you, it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>like, OK, well, the contemplative and reform side that came as a result of the smell of</p>
<p>all those bodies also seems to fade.</p>
<p>So, you know, one might say that there, you know, when the person who asked the question</p>
<p>was asking, he&rsquo;s basically sort of asking, isn&rsquo;t he?</p>
<p>How can we how can we maintain the benefits that come when somebody smacks humanity in</p>
<p>the face with something like a world war long afterwards?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the old line about people forgetting history, right?</p>
<p>It seems as if as well, my buddy Bob phrase it to me the other day like this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like trying to do a Rubik&rsquo;s Cube that fights back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful line.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s like playing a game of cards where every two minutes a new deck is introduced.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked a couple of different times in a couple of different places about this</p>
<p>idea that history doesn&rsquo;t teach us what we think it can.</p>
<p>Can you expand on that?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure, because I think everybody winces when they hear somebody trying to say something</p>
<p>like, well, 1938 at Munich teaches us you can&rsquo;t appease dictators or something like</p>
<p>that, because that&rsquo;s exactly what history doesn&rsquo;t teach us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly the line that somebody had once said about it being like a river where</p>
<p>you can put your toe in the river and it&rsquo;s the same river, but it&rsquo;s not the same water,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not the same water at the same place at the same time.</p>
<p>So what I always say about the Hitler analogy is what 1938 really teaches you is you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>appease that dictator at that time over that subject.</p>
<p>So it really doesn&rsquo;t teach you much of anything.</p>
<p>But what history does seem to teach us is certain things involving, well, for example,</p>
<p>the herd stuff.</p>
<p>So we talked earlier about how we&rsquo;re all reacting humanity-wise to what we&rsquo;re facing now with</p>
<p>the coronavirus and that some of that stuff was that if I brought anything in the recent</p>
<p>book I wrote to the table, it&rsquo;s certainly not the Nostradamus-like prediction about</p>
<p>a coronavirus, because all the experts were predicting that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about how people behave once they have a threat of a virus, though.</p>
<p>So the 1938 analogy doesn&rsquo;t work, but it does teach us the herd stuff, right?</p>
<p>The stuff like we were talking about in the book, the Nostradamus-type thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not Nostradamus to predict a COVID virus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s predicting how we&rsquo;re all going to react.</p>
<p>And truthfully, we reacted a little like you&rsquo;d expect a mass group of humans to react, whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the 21st century or the 10th century.</p>
<p>So I found that to be something where you could say, OK, history doesn&rsquo;t teach us how</p>
<p>to behave in any given situation, but history shows us how large groups of us might behave</p>
<p>in certain situations.</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s a little bit less about specific lessons and a little bit more about</p>
<p>big picture, broad trend reactions, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Dan, we started this conversation by me asking you about the title of your book, The End</p>
<p>Is Always Near.</p>
<p>If you release this book now, as opposed to last fall, would chapter six be chapter one?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure chapter six, and that&rsquo;s the pandemic prologue chapter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it would be in the book at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those things where you look at it now and you would almost say, well, why</p>
<p>would you put that here?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, we it&rsquo;s almost like we understand it&rsquo;s only interesting to me because it hasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>happened.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I would suggest that if I wrote the book today, that probably wouldn&rsquo;t even be in there</p>
<p>because you would sit there and go so often, you know, well, what&rsquo;s the I mean, we know</p>
<p>right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking about all these science fiction like things that might happen during a pandemic</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re sitting here going, it&rsquo;s not science fiction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing it now.</p>
<p>One guy wrote me an interesting line.</p>
<p>It was on Twitter, I think, where he said, I thought you were jumping the shark when</p>
<p>you said that, you know, would society shut down again with a modern pandemic?</p>
<p>And yet here we are.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m as surprised as everybody.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say this.</p>
<p>I asked it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I was asking a bunch of questions throughout the whole book.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no answers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bunch of questions.</p>
<p>So when you ask a bunch of questions about what if a pandemic happened and then a pandemic</p>
<p>happens, it&rsquo;s almost like, well, why would I put those questions in the book?</p>
<p>That chapter is moot.</p>
<p>One final one from me.</p>
<p>The themes you tend to talk about a lot, end of the world, technological regression.</p>
<p>What interests you right now, Dan, as we record this podcast?</p>
<p>What is top of mind outside of pandemic, which is on the top of everybody&rsquo;s mind?</p>
<p>Certainly.</p>
<p>What else interests Dan Carlin right now?</p>
<p>I think, listen, I think like a lot of Americans, I&rsquo;m watching the political situation.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s something that that has become so unpredictable that I think it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>take your eyes off of it very long and focus on other things.</p>
<p>So I would say that right now and obviously this is highlighted by the situation we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in.</p>
<p>But if you recall before this situation, we had a not as significant, but another significant</p>
<p>crisis.</p>
<p>So I feel like even if you want to focus on other things right now, at least in the United</p>
<p>States, but I would imagine worldwide, your attention is is drawn away from those things</p>
<p>towards the the bigger show going on right now.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s a way to put it.</p>
<p>Dan, you&rsquo;re the best at this.</p>
<p>How do we end this one on a positive note?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m out of cue cards from the the hot docks event.</p>
<p>You know, somebody was saying to me the other day, I was having a conversation with somebody</p>
<p>the other day and we were talking about worst case scenarios and they were saying, well,</p>
<p>and they were saying that they thought the worst case scenario would be when somebody</p>
<p>did something really drastic, right?</p>
<p>Terrorism or somebody bombed something or just some big, awful thing.</p>
<p>And I said, yes, I said, that does sound pretty darn bad.</p>
<p>And you might be right.</p>
<p>I said, although we should understand something, that there&rsquo;s another way it can go when that</p>
<p>happens, right?</p>
<p>The other way it could go is that it&rsquo;s like a slap in the face towards society.</p>
<p>So let me use the example of the late 1960s, early 70s and what was called the new left</p>
<p>back then and what became the edge of the violent left back then, the weather underground,</p>
<p>those kind of people.</p>
<p>When SDS went to the weather underground or when the Symbionese Liberation Army was running</p>
<p>around and all these things, those people took the political rhetoric of the time, which</p>
<p>seemed pretty extreme to the logical conclusions, and started planting bombs.</p>
<p>When we had hundreds of bombings in a couple of years, the average Americans, who might</p>
<p>have been some of them anyway, open to some countercultural message.</p>
<p>Remember the John Lennon line, you know, if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao,</p>
<p>you ain&rsquo;t going to make it with anyone.</p>
<p>And you have that.</p>
<p>There was something about, hey, man, right on.</p>
<p>This all sounds great, the revolution and all that.</p>
<p>But when people are getting bombed a lot, it wakes.</p>
<p>It could go the other way, too.</p>
<p>Like we said, the burning of the Reichstag enables Hitler.</p>
<p>And you have the Nazis.</p>
<p>You can go that route, too.</p>
<p>But it can also go, wait a minute now, time to get real here, right?</p>
<p>It has a way of waking up the ballast of society, or what did Nixon call them?</p>
<p>The silent majority.</p>
<p>Does this mean the silent majority?</p>
<p>We just have to just wait for a good terror attack and all this will be over?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>You can have the Reichstag burning thing we just mentioned.</p>
<p>But for your silver lining here, there is a possibility that the way you get a correction</p>
<p>is when something goes too far.</p>
<p>So if something goes too far, that would be called looking at the bright side.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to tell you how to do your podcast, Dan, but that is a perfect line to end it.</p>
<p>A thousand thanks to my friend Jeff Merrick for being willing to do this,</p>
<p>not once, but twice for me.</p>
<p>Check out his work on Rogers Communications&rsquo; Sportsnet.</p>
<p>You can also find his stuff.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the co-host of the 31 Thoughts podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an awesome guy.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re Canadian, you don&rsquo;t need me to tell you about Jeff Merrick.</p>
<p>You probably heard about me from Jeff.</p>
<p>In any case, he&rsquo;s a wonderful guy.</p>
<p>I enjoy him a lot.</p>
<p>And hopefully we can do this again and make it a trifecta at some point.</p>
<p>Also, just a little update on Supernova Progress.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say more than two-thirds of the way done.</p>
<p>Sorry for the wait.</p>
<p>But you know how I roll.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got multiple feeds and I like to put out just a trickle of content out on each one of them.</p>
<p>And sort of trickle down economics.</p>
<p>This is trickle-out podcasting and we are just, you know, reverting to form here.</p>
<p>I should point out just a little announcement.</p>
<p>If you ever want to find out where the shows are in terms of,</p>
<p>you know, when we release them and make sure you&rsquo;re on,</p>
<p>we do have a Twitter feed at Hardcore History.</p>
<p>And we make sure that anytime we put anything out, we announce it there.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll never miss a show release.</p>
<p>Also, if you&rsquo;ve had any problems accessing the paid archives.</p>
<p>And for those who don&rsquo;t know, we keep the recent shows up free for years.</p>
<p>And then after several years, we move them to the paid archive.</p>
<p>And you can get them off our website or iTunes or some other places.</p>
<p>And apparently we had an OS update that broke something</p>
<p>that we didn&rsquo;t know about on Apple Podcast or iTunes.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve had problems getting shows recently, that should be fixed.</p>
<p>And I wanted to make sure we thank you all</p>
<p>because you telling us about it helped us to find it.</p>
<p>So once again, we&rsquo;re like a little community here.</p>
<p>And I do want to say that as a little community here,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little weird during this whole period we&rsquo;re living in right now.</p>
<p>This whole coronavirus era.</p>
<p>I feel like we&rsquo;re getting, I feel like that line, you know,</p>
<p>the end of history or sort of a respite from history</p>
<p>that they used to say about geopolitical concerns</p>
<p>after the Cold War and before the 9-11 attacks.</p>
<p>I think that kind of applies to us now in a germ virus disease kind of sense maybe.</p>
<p>Like all of a sudden we&rsquo;re getting the tiniest little taste of what it was like.</p>
<p>We probably deal with it differently.</p>
<p>But what it was like to live in fear of communicable disease</p>
<p>is in a way we haven&rsquo;t done in a while.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a crappy way to have to have some empathy with people in the past, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a weirdly human thing to kind of almost need something like this</p>
<p>to remind us that we&rsquo;re all in this together, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I mean, do you have to have a world war to create national unity?</p>
<p>Do you have to have a coronavirus to remind us that we&rsquo;re all connected?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll tell you what.</p>
<p>I never feel disconnected from you folks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny because everybody&rsquo;s lives have been totally put upside down</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m still working the way I always do.</p>
<p>And because my life is not disrupted as much as most people&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I constantly am thankful for the fact I&rsquo;m able to do this.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all your fault.</p>
<p>So thank you.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;re all doing okay.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to, you know, ease out of this thing, I think, together.</p>
<p>Stay safe, everybody.</p>
<p>And, you know, we&rsquo;ll be trickling out our content to you</p>
<p>at our normal torrid pace in the near future.</p>
