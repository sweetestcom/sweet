<ul>
<li>So, we have waited longer than we ever thought possible</li>
</ul>
<p>to say the following words;</p>
<p>distinguish guests, members of the faculty and staff</p>
<p>and friends of the graduates</p>
<p>and members of the graduating classes of 2020</p>
<p>and 2021, on behalf of our esteemed faculty and staff,</p>
<p>I welcome you to Berkeley Haas</p>
<p>full-time MBA commencement ceremony.</p>
<p>(audience cheering)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ann Harrison, Dean of the Haas School,</p>
<p>it is my duty and great pleasure</p>
<p>to officiate at today&rsquo;s ceremony.</p>
<p>To our full-time MBA graduates of the classes of 2020</p>
<p>and 2021, I welcome you to the Paramount Theater,</p>
<p>a landmark treasure that provides a stage</p>
<p>only for the most accomplished and celebrated creative minds</p>
<p>from around the world,</p>
<p>no wonder we are here.</p>
<p>I congratulate you on your remarkable achievement,</p>
<p>against the turbulence of the past two years,</p>
<p>you managed to complete</p>
<p>your Master of Business Administration</p>
<p>at one of the best business schools in the world,</p>
<p>and we are incredibly proud of you.</p>
<p>(audience cheering)</p>
<p>I would like to take this moment to recognize spouses,</p>
<p>significant others, parents, children,</p>
<p>extended family members and friends</p>
<p>who supported our graduates during what I imagine</p>
<p>were the most challenging few years of their lives.</p>
<p>All of you are true partners in the achievements</p>
<p>of our graduates, who we celebrate today.</p>
<p>Would the graduating students please join me</p>
<p>in a round of applause to honor these very special people.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>When you join Berkeley Haas,</p>
<p>you joined a world class institution</p>
<p>at the epicenter of innovation.</p>
<p>You were already accomplished professionals</p>
<p>before coming to Haas,</p>
<p>but you decided to invest in yourselves</p>
<p>to become indispensable business leaders.</p>
<p>You did all of this while balancing your careers,</p>
<p>family responsibilities and personal lives.</p>
<p>And suddenly, your world was upended.</p>
<p>The global pandemic disrupted your MBA experience</p>
<p>in the middle of your programs</p>
<p>and it disrupted everything else.</p>
<p>You were unable to family members or friends.</p>
<p>You worried about elderly relatives.</p>
<p>And if you had children of your own,</p>
<p>you added homeschooling to your already long, long list.</p>
<p>I know that this was not the experience you had expected.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not what we wanted for you either.</p>
<p>We could see the heartbreak on your faces, even on Zoom.</p>
<p>We really missed seeing you in person, getting to know you.</p>
<p>We all missed out on a lot of things</p>
<p>over the last two years,</p>
<p>but through everything, you showed a grit and a resilience</p>
<p>that was unparalleled,</p>
<p>you showed courage and conscience,</p>
<p>simply put you showed leadership.</p>
<p>If you ever doubted whether you could lead through a crisis,</p>
<p>overcome impossible odds, breakthrough barriers,</p>
<p>you have your answer.</p>
<p>Through the crucible of these years,</p>
<p>you were tested with your fierce intelligence, compassion,</p>
<p>strength, you have demonstrated to the world</p>
<p>just how much you can do in the most difficult of times.</p>
<p>I could not be more proud.</p>
<p>You have graduated with a degree in business</p>
<p>from the number one public university in the world.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>You will make an impact on that world.</p>
<p>And over the course of your careers,</p>
<p>you will find yourselves among the very top of wage earners</p>
<p>among your peers, from the other leading business schools.</p>
<p>And wherever you go,</p>
<p>you will always have the power of Haas behind you.</p>
<p>What you have been through together</p>
<p>is unlike anything Haasies have experienced before,</p>
<p>but through it, you have forged a bond unlike any other.</p>
<p>And now you join a dynamic network of over 42,000 Haas alums</p>
<p>and over 500,000 Berkeley alumni around the world.</p>
<p>They are there for you.</p>
<p>They will open doors for you.</p>
<p>All you need to do is reach out.</p>
<p>So, lean on your Haas community and contribute to it.</p>
<p>Answer calls from perspective and current students</p>
<p>who need your advice.</p>
<p>Hire Haas, come to the Haas reunion celebrations,</p>
<p>the very first one starts this weekend.</p>
<p>Our alumni teams work to make the timing happen.</p>
<p>We hope to see you there, you are our newest alumni.</p>
<p>The more you connect, the stronger the Haas network becomes.</p>
<p>Now, it is my great honor to introduce you</p>
<p>to one of those alums.</p>
<p>One of the great traditions at the Haas School</p>
<p>is the selection of our commencement speaker.</p>
<p>Every year, we call upon an individual</p>
<p>of uncommon distinction to address</p>
<p>the MBA graduating classes.</p>
<p>Someone who personifies our defining leadership principles.</p>
<p>This year, we are delighted</p>
<p>that the Berkeley Haas MBA commencement speaker</p>
<p>is such a leader, a role model whose career</p>
<p>shows the power and the impact of what we mean</p>
<p>when we say students always.</p>

<ul>
<li>Well, good afternoon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you so much, and thank you Dean Harrison</p>
<p>for such a kind and generous introduction,</p>
<p>and for the opportunity to speak at this ceremony.</p>
<p>To the members of the faculty and staff, alumni, family,</p>
<p>friends, loved ones, and most importantly,</p>
<p>the illustrious members of the full-time Haas MBA classes</p>
<p>of 2020 and 2021, congratulations to you.</p>
<p>This is a wonderful time to rejoice and celebrate.</p>
<p>This is your day.</p>
<p>I hope you can indulge me for a moment</p>
<p>and pause to acknowledge challenging social economic</p>
<p>and civic events to we have experienced.</p>
<p>Our hearts go out to those who have been adversely affected</p>
<p>and we stand with and for them.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s appreciate how seriously fortunate we are</p>
<p>to be here together and to be associated</p>
<p>with this world renowned institution.</p>
<p>It is indeed an incredible honor for me to return</p>
<p>to my Alma mater as your commencement speaker.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a true privilege to personally congratulate</p>
<p>all of you on earning your MBA from Haas.</p>
<p>While this is a commencement, let&rsquo;s be real,</p>
<p>we are beyond commencement, the journey has already begun.</p>
<p>You are now pursuing postgraduate studies</p>
<p>about how to learn, live and lead in this new world,</p>
<p>addressing inequity and injustice,</p>
<p>providing care for yourself and your families</p>
<p>and communities and working in a hybrid environment,</p>
<p>and through incredible reservoirs of resilience</p>
<p>and resolve making a difference.</p>
<p>If there is anything that we&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>since your graduation, it is how we as leaders,</p>
<p>each have a critical role to play</p>
<p>in changing the world for the better.</p>
<p>And we play that role with purpose,</p>
<p>and in the tradition of Haas.</p>
<p>Four leadership principles are at the core</p>
<p>of this tradition beyond yourself,</p>
<p>question the status quo, confidence without attitude</p>
<p>and students always.</p>
<p>These four principles represent a process for investigating,</p>
<p>understanding and changing the world.</p>
<p>But let me begin with purpose.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like me, you love &ldquo;Ted Talks&rdquo;</p>
<p>and Simon Sinek did a talk on &ldquo;Start with why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And his talk has had millions and millions upon views</p>
<p>and the premises that people won&rsquo;t buy a product</p>
<p>or a service or embrace a movement or idea</p>
<p>unless they understand the why behind it.</p>
<p>Every organization has its why, its mission statement,</p>
<p>and Simon Sinek encourages us to find our own personal why.</p>
<p>When I was a vice president at Microsoft,</p>
<p>our goal was to build teams that could accomplish</p>
<p>any challenge and take on any kind of issue.</p>
<p>So, we collaborated with an organization</p>
<p>called Compete to Create,</p>
<p>and they designed a training program</p>
<p>to help us develop those high performing teams</p>
<p>and creating your own personal philosophy statement</p>
<p>was absolutely critical to it.</p>
<p>So, we completed this exercise, we developed this statement,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s your purpose, it&rsquo;s your set of guiding principles.</p>
<p>And we were creating it using words that we selected</p>
<p>from a sheet of paper to craft the statement.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m gonna share my personal</p>
<p>philosophy statement with you.</p>
<p>It is to live life in an exemplary manner,</p>
<p>in all that matters with courage, curiosity, compassion,</p>
<p>humility, integrity, and optimism.</p>
<p>And each one of those words has a story behind it.</p>
<p>Each member of my team created</p>
<p>their own personal philosophy statement,</p>
<p>and you could come up to them anytime and ask them</p>
<p>what theirs were and they would share it with you.</p>
<p>When we needed to mobilize or activate the team,</p>
<p>all we need to do is leverage those statements.</p>
<p>One day, Dean Richard Lyons visited with me</p>
<p>when I was at Microsoft.</p>
<p>He was doing a listening tour, visiting with alumni</p>
<p>and prospective students.</p>
<p>And he and I both noted how closely aligned</p>
<p>my personal philosophy statement was</p>
<p>with the Haas&rsquo; leadership principles.</p>
<p>We both believe it was evidence about how you can gain more</p>
<p>than just a classic from the business school here at Haas,</p>
<p>we realize how deeply impactful the curriculum is,</p>
<p>and it really helped to shape our purpose</p>
<p>and also the values as an expression of our leadership.</p>
<p>So, let me share with you just a few examples</p>
<p>of that alignment.</p>
<p>The word exemplary for me, has two meanings,</p>
<p>and one is about being your very best,</p>
<p>and the other is about being a role model for others.</p>
<p>And the story behind exemplary for me begins with my parents</p>
<p>who were born and raised and Colon, Panama.</p>
<p>My mother is here today, Barbara Joan Clayton,</p>
<p>(speaks foreign language)</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>And my father, Sylvester Valentine Clayton, Jr,</p>
<p>unfortunately could not be here,</p>
<p>he had passed away, sadly, may he rest in peace.</p>
<p>But my parents, like many others,</p>
<p>wanted to come to the United States</p>
<p>because they wanted to pursue the American Dream.</p>
<p>And one of the ways to do it is to join the military,</p>
<p>which is what my father did,</p>
<p>and the first place he was stationed was Bermuda,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where I was born.</p>
<p>My parents sacrificed a lot to come to the United States,</p>
<p>many things they left behind,</p>
<p>their native language, Spanish,</p>
<p>their culture, family, friends,</p>
<p>and they placed the wellbeing of their children</p>
<p>ahead of themselves.</p>
<p>As a result, I&rsquo;ve always felt that I need to honor</p>
<p>that sacrifice by being my very best</p>
<p>and through the teaching of my parents,</p>
<p>they gave us the belief</p>
<p>that we needed to be responsible for others,</p>
<p>and that is how it informs the Haas leadership principle</p>
<p>for be beyond yourself.</p>
<p>And as you heard, I have volunteered</p>
<p>and worked with the Belfer Center of 92 Y</p>
<p>in helping in a program called Women in Power,</p>
<p>and that is a program for training and networking with women</p>
<p>to help them become leaders.</p>
<p>As leaders in the Haas tradition,</p>
<p>when we are doing our very best work,</p>
<p>we are shaping the world for others to be better.</p>
<p>The next leadership principle</p>
<p>is about questioning the status quo.</p>
<p>And there are many stories about what happens</p>
<p>to a company when they do if you resist that change,</p>
<p>if you maintain the status quo,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;re not gonna go very far.</p>
<p>But questioning the status quo often requires a willingness</p>
<p>to take a risk, which brings me to my next story</p>
<p>about the word courage in my personal philosophy statement.</p>
<p>After Bermuda, my father was stationed</p>
<p>at Travis Air Force Base in Northern California.</p>
<p>And because my family was growing,</p>
<p>my brother Sylvester Valentine Clayton III,</p>
<p>my sister who is here, Jennifer Florence Clayton,</p>
<p>we were running out of room, we needed a new place to stay.</p>
<p>My mother called around</p>
<p>and learned of several potential options,</p>
<p>made an appointment to go see a place.</p>
<p>And when she and my father arrived,</p>
<p>turns out that no places were available,</p>
<p>they were no longer available.</p>
<p>Well, what a surprise?</p>
<p>You can imagine how that felt to be treated in that matter.</p>
<p>So as immigrants to the United States,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s many things that you could do.</p>
<p>You could do nothing, don&rsquo;t make any waves,</p>
<p>or you could pursue a course of action</p>
<p>that could be costly and could be risky.</p>
<p>Well, my parents showed courage,</p>
<p>they filed a complaint and they won.</p>
<p>And I will say to you, that was a defining moment for me,</p>
<p>because that was from then on the reason</p>
<p>why I wanted to be a lawyer, I wanted to give voice</p>
<p>to those who wanted to protect their rights.</p>
<p>And so, I enrolled at UC Berkeley,</p>
<p>pursuing the MBA-JD joint degree program,</p>
<p>and later leveraged both of those degrees</p>
<p>to provide a support and form of pro bono work to women</p>
<p>and people of color who wanted to start their businesses.</p>
<p>Maintaining the status quo</p>
<p>can seriously weaken growth potential,</p>
<p>and leaders need to have a growth mindset.</p>
<p>A state of mind that doesn&rsquo;t settle for the minimum,</p>
<p>instead looks for how things can be improved</p>
<p>and what I am so proud of is that my family</p>
<p>is support of that.</p>
<p>My husband, Ed McDonald, my children, Clayton Hutchins,</p>
<p>Taji Hutchins, and Megan Ludlow,</p>
<p>they believe in that and they live their lives that way.</p>
<p>And as leaders in the Haas tradition,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s our responsibility,</p>
<p>to have the courage, to create a culture</p>
<p>where questioning the status quo is encouraged.</p>
<p>Confidence, that&rsquo;s a powerful trait,</p>
<p>that belief that you have in yourself and your abilities.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve all heard the saying, seeing is believing,</p>
<p>but that starts with a foundation of doubt.</p>
<p>And our family, we switch it around,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s believing is seeing.</p>
<p>Believing in your self, your hope, optimism,</p>
<p>your perseverance, your dreams will come true.</p>
<p>And given the world in which we live,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to have that level of confidence,</p>
<p>but also it without attitude, to be humble.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the words</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in my personal philosophy statement too,</p>
<p>approaching opportunities, challenges with an open mind,</p>
<p>valuing others, their opinions and perspectives</p>
<p>is absolutely key.</p>
<p>And the last that I&rsquo;d like to share</p>
<p>is really about the word curiosity,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s in my personal philosophy statement,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s an alignment with students always.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be an astronaut one day,</p>
<p>that was my 10 year old self declaring to my parents,</p>
<p>and they said, of course you will.</p>
<p>You could do anything that you want to.</p>
<p>And what I love about it is that I had an opportunity</p>
<p>with loving parents that said, you know what?</p>
<p>Every astronaut needs to have a telescope.</p>
<p>So you know what?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna build one.</p>
<p>So, my father got a copy of &ldquo;Scientific American Magazine,&rdquo;</p>
<p>and there were instructions about how to build a telescope,</p>
<p>and so we did, we bought the lens,</p>
<p>we bought the PVC pipe for the tubes, but I gotta tell you,</p>
<p>when we set it up to look at the stars, it didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Oh well, and my father said, wait,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve missed the point here,</p>
<p>this is a learning opportunity.</p>
<p>This is where you challenge your boundaries,</p>
<p>you stretch your limits, you&rsquo;re gonna try,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna fail, but you&rsquo;re gonna learn.</p>
<p>And what I love about that lesson</p>
<p>is so in line with students always,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re gonna be able to do as folks</p>
<p>that are in the Haas tradition,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re gonna change the world.</p>
<p>For me, the four Haas leadership principles</p>
<p>have always been a way to guide my journey</p>
<p>and multiply my impact in the world.</p>
<p>And it is my sincere hope that leveraging the principles</p>
<p>in your journey will allow you to do the same.</p>
<p>Again, congratulations to you classes of 2020 and 2021,</p>
<p>thank you for allowing me to share in your celebration.</p>
<p>I wish you the best of luck as you accomplish great things,</p>
<p>change the world and lead in the tradition of Haas.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you so much, Laura.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would now like to acknowledge the graduates</p>
<p>of the full-time MBA classes of 20 and 21</p>
<p>who have earned the honor</p>
<p>of being named &ldquo;Berkeley Haas beyond yourself fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These students have completed 60 hours or more</p>
<p>of community service, while completing their MBA degrees.</p>
<p>All beyond yourself fellows</p>
<p>are listed in the commencement program.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s take a moment and give them a round of applause.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>So now, we&rsquo;re going to turn to the full-time class of 2020.</p>
<p>You graduated during the pandemic</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure your personal and professional lives</p>
<p>were turned upside down.</p>
<p>I applaud you for managing this uncertainty</p>
<p>and leaning into the defining leadership principles</p>
<p>to help you navigate this new reality.</p>
<p>Many of you went beyond yourselves</p>
<p>with selfless acts of kindness.</p>
<p>Others questioned the status quo</p>
<p>and found new ways to thrive in uncertain times.</p>
<p>All of you made us proud.</p>
<p>We would now like to recognize the winners</p>
<p>of the class of 2020 Defining Leadership Principles Awards</p>
<p>and the Berkeley Leader Award.</p>
<p>Your class has nominated classmates</p>
<p>who have made outstanding contributions</p>
<p>to your MBA experience and who best embody the DLPs.</p>
<p>Now, I am going to announce the recipients of each principle</p>
<p>and Berkeley Leader Awards.</p>
<p>As I do that, can that individual please stand,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m going to ask that our guests hold applause</p>
<p>until I&rsquo;ve read all the names</p>
<p>and ask our award recipients to continue standing</p>
<p>when you hear your name called and remain standing</p>
<p>until all the awards have been announced.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;ll start with Question the Status Quo,</p>
<p>this award recipient champions bold ideas,</p>
<p>takes intelligent risks and accept sensible failures.</p>
<p>Someone who&rsquo;s willing to speak their mind,</p>
<p>even when it challenges convention,</p>
<p>and the recipient of that award is Evan Wright.</p>
<p>(audience applauding)</p>
<p>Okay, I won&rsquo;t say anything about following directions.</p>
<p>So, in Evan, his classmates saw an unstoppable leader,</p>
<p>always encouraging others and building community,</p>
<p>the thoughtfulness and skill in guiding discussions</p>
<p>around diversity, equity and inclusion he showed</p>
<p>in week zero continued throughout his formal roles</p>
<p>as a student government leader</p>
<p>and facilitator for the dialogues on race course.</p>
<p>The next award is for Confidence Without Attitude,</p>
<p>someone who makes decisions based on evidence and analysis</p>
<p>and leads through trust and collaboration.</p>
<p>And the award goes to Celeste Faaiuaso.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>Celeste, her classmates said made Haas a kinder,</p>
<p>more inclusive and connected community.</p>
<p>Brilliant, driven, and accomplished,</p>
<p>Celeste was always friendly and humble.</p>
<p>By treating others with empathy,</p>
<p>she unfailingly displayed a quiet confidence and power.</p>
<p>The Student Always Award is given to the student</p>
<p>who stands out for engaging with others</p>
<p>in continuous pursuit of knowledge and growth.</p>
<p>And that individual is Nina Ho.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>Many of the nominations for Nina used the word always.</p>
<p>Always prepared for group projects</p>
<p>and worked harder than anyone else,</p>
<p>always seeking to gain new skills,</p>
<p>always seeking to learn more about our chosen field.</p>
<p>In other words, a student always.</p>
<p>The next award for Beyond Yourself</p>
<p>goes to the person fellow students saw as leading ethically</p>
<p>and responsibly, putting larger interests above their own.</p>
<p>For the class of 2020,</p>
<p>The Beyond Yourself Award recipient is Benny Johnson.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>So, the sheer number of nominations</p>
<p>and their consistency in appreciation</p>
<p>for all Benny did for others was overwhelming,</p>
<p>proof of his personal belief that life is more meaningful</p>
<p>when it is lived in service.</p>
<p>Next one, Berkeley Leader, this award recipient demonstrates</p>
<p>sharing our defining leadership principles,</p>
<p>aspiring to live our principles</p>
<p>and putting them into practice.</p>
<p>We have two recipients in the 2020 class.</p>
<p>First, Molly Zeins.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>And secondly, Ezgi Karaagac.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>Both our Berkeley leaders served in student government</p>
<p>and both were focused, fierce and thoughtful advocates,</p>
<p>both went above and beyond themselves,</p>
<p>Molly with her support to our community,</p>
<p>as we pivoted to remote learning.</p>
<p>And Ezgi, for helping attain the STEM designation</p>
<p>for MBA degrees.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>And by the way, your Dean worked on that too.</p>
<p>Now, international students</p>
<p>who graduate from the full-time MBA program</p>
<p>are eligible to apply for a two year work permit extension</p>
<p>in the US.</p>
<p>And we want to recognize two other graduates</p>
<p>of the class of 2020.</p>
<p>The Awards Committee felt the work called</p>
<p>for an all new award, and honored Francesco Dipierro,</p>
<p>and Santiago Freyria with the first ever Haas Legacy Award</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>Love that STEP T-shirt.</p>
<p>They co-founded STEP, a student run incubator</p>
<p>that helps students who want to start their own companies</p>
<p>get matched with mentors, improving the odds</p>
<p>that they will see their ideas and dreams come to life.</p>
<p>So, congratulations to all the honorees</p>
<p>and you may now give them a round of applause.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>You may be seated.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one more award for the class of 2020,</p>
<p>it is my pleasure now to present</p>
<p>the class of 2020 outstanding Academic Achievement Award.</p>
<p>The Academic Achievement Award is presented to the student</p>
<p>with the highest GPA in the class.</p>
<p>That student is Brian Shain.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>Brian had a very impressive GPA of 3.91,</p>
<p>congratulations Brian.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>We will now hear from the graduating student</p>
<p>who was selected by his classmates</p>
<p>to represent the full-time MBA class of 2020, Joe Sutkowski.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>Wow, at Haas, Joe won a teaching award</p>
<p>for Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor</p>
<p>and was a tech peer advisor.</p>
<p>He is now a strategy and operations lead at Google,</p>
<p>though he claims to have his eye</p>
<p>on that Google daily doodle coordinator spot.</p>
<p>He might even be serious about that,</p>
<p>you can never be sure with Joe.</p>
<p>So, please join me in welcoming Joe Sutkowski,</p>
<p>class of 2020.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh man.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Joe Sutkowski or Jojo, the 2020 class speaker.</p>
<p>Woo!</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m here to finally remind you</p>
<p>about your car&rsquo;s extended warranty, pick up the phone.</p>
<p>Seriously though, I can&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re actually finally here.</p>
<p>Scheduling this graduation was like running into</p>
<p>that one friend of a friend at a bar and saying like, yes,</p>
<p>like we should totally get brunch tomorrow.</p>
<p>And then tomorrow comes, and you&rsquo;re a little hungover,</p>
<p>but you think it might be COVID</p>
<p>so you just text them shamefully saying like,</p>
<p>sorry, something came up next week, next week for sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that, but for two years.</p>
<p>Just imagining a crazed Pete Johnson,</p>
<p>manually moving that Google calendar,</p>
<p>invite 100 times, going like any week now,</p>
<p>any week, this will be the one.</p>
<p>But yeah, COVID was wild, it is still wild.</p>
<p>We as a collective, just aged in dog years</p>
<p>during this period,</p>
<p>sneezing in public is now legally assault.</p>
<p>And I personally gained 20 pounds to COVID 19</p>
<p>and moved into my mom&rsquo;s basement.</p>
<p>So you could say things are going pretty well for me.</p>
<p>Oh man, I feel like my 12 year old self would be like,</p>
<p>where did we go wrong?</p>
<p>Like, what is Haas, is that a jail?</p>
<p>Is that rehab?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>But now that COVID is ending,</p>
<p>it means we have to go back to the office</p>
<p>and stop re watching the British bakeoff</p>
<p>or the Beatles documentary, if it&rsquo;ll ever end.</p>
<p>Basically, we just need to go back because of culture,</p>
<p>but I ask you the culture of what?</p>
<p>Ashamedly pooping next to my boss,</p>
<p>who I&rsquo;ve identified by their shoes?</p>
<p>Lodging little test farts masked by coughs</p>
<p>to try not to be too loud,</p>
<p>but the saddest part, no, they&rsquo;re all great things,</p>
<p>the connection, the human experience is great,</p>
<p>but the saddest part is that now that we&rsquo;re de masking,</p>
<p>ugh, I have to go back to brushing my teeth every day.</p>
<p>Segue, Fede is here today, woo!</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the other speaker from the class of 2021,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s amazing, I know him a little bit.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure if I knew him more, I would still think that,</p>
<p>but I met him when I was a peer advisor</p>
<p>and I reviewed his resume during my tenure,</p>
<p>and after seeing it, I was like, seriously impressed.</p>
<p>It was so good.</p>
<p>It was like startup co-founder, adjunct professor</p>
<p>at like 25, and basically he was a straight A student,</p>
<p>and he asked me, he was like, Jojo,</p>
<p>do you know how I can get a job in big tech?</p>
<p>And I was like, do you?</p>
<p>Like, do you have any advice?</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Anyways, so, woo!</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>So, when my class elected me as their speaker,</p>
<p>and this part&rsquo;s serious,</p>
<p>amid the most like unique period of our lives,</p>
<p>during like in an unprecedented global health crisis</p>
<p>in COVID with like record economic uncertainty,</p>
<p>incredible Black Lives Matters protest.</p>
<p>My first thought was we really need Kamala or someone else</p>
<p>to weigh in on this</p>
<p>and like balance this whole thing out, okay?</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t know if you notice,</p>
<p>but generic white male, all right,</p>
<p>my name is literally Joe twice, okay?</p>
<p>Oh, where did he grow up?</p>
<p>The suburbs. Did he have a golden retriever as a pet?</p>
<p>Yes, it wore an American flag bandana,</p>
<p>like how could I possibly opine on like this?</p>
<p>Like where is Kamala, can we get Kamala?</p>
<p>Geez.</p>
<p>But Haas, the world needs direction,</p>
<p>the world is to heal,</p>
<p>and this 29 year old white guy who still quotes SpongeBob</p>
<p>is exactly what we need, okay?</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m ready, we&rsquo;re clearly questioning the status quo</p>
<p>with that one.</p>
<p>Man, but FYI, Haas originally told me</p>
<p>that I have five minutes for this speech, nice try.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>Oh my Lord.</p>
<p>For every day this speech was delayed,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve added one more minute, okay?</p>
<p>So, I hope you all ate before this,</p>
<p>except for the one person whose chair</p>
<p>I taped a cliff bar underneath,</p>
<p>you all should check, paging Rogigi 118, it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>So, my first hour is just gonna be improv work,</p>
<p>which everyone will love.</p>
<p>Hour two is gonna be,</p>
<p>hour two is gonna be prop comedy including now.</p>
<p>Oh man, and hour three is solely dedicated</p>
<p>to a live reading of my fan fiction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Boy with the Ring who Lived,&rdquo;</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the story about Frodo Baggins</p>
<p>slowly turning into Harry Potter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently working out a few kinks, but if you&rsquo;d like,</p>
<p>I can give a little bit for you.</p>
<p>You shall not pass,</p>
<p>portion&rsquo;s cast.</p>
<p>And the funny thing is that was actually my sixth word essay</p>
<p>to get into Haas.</p>
<p>Morgan loved it.</p>
<p>Haas is a funny place, it&rsquo;s a great place.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t even agree</p>
<p>on how to pronounce our school&rsquo;s name, okay?</p>
<p>Is it Haas or Haaz, is a classic Libiosa-Labiosa dilemma.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s equally as challenging as the trolley problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually not sure why Haas teaches us that.</p>
<p>Does Haas note the lack of Z in my pronunciation?</p>
<p>Because there is no Z.</p>
<p>Does Haas know the decisions</p>
<p>that post MBA jobs require us to make?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically should I use V lookup</p>
<p>or Google how to do index match again?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it, there&rsquo;s no in between.</p>
<p>As such, it&rsquo;s time I reveal the fifth defining principle.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the greatest hits like question the status quo,</p>
<p>and students always, and now analyst for one year post MBA,</p>
<p>at least, okay?</p>
<p>Oh God.</p>
<p>And this is where about where I planned</p>
<p>to like receive my own slap from like the faculty,</p>
<p>the Will Smith slap.</p>
<p>Man, but truly, Haas such a special, incredible place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the birthplace of Pokemon go,</p>
<p>and unfortunately, that one guy from Theranos</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s home of amazing people</p>
<p>and those who went into investment banking.</p>
<p>Kidding.</p>
<p>kidding, kidding.</p>
<p>Haas, the suits think we&rsquo;re hippies</p>
<p>and the hippies think we&rsquo;re suits,</p>
<p>where do we fit?</p>
<p>The other colleges at Berkeley will be like,</p>
<p>we invented gene editing,</p>
<p>which represents the literal next step in human evolution,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crisper, and then Haas says over here,</p>
<p>we run Annie&rsquo;s Crispy Mac and Cheese,</p>
<p>now available for the low cost of 3.99,</p>
<p>Clearly beyond yourself.</p>
<p>Okay, so, time for some themes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve already had the memes, it&rsquo;s time for themes.</p>
<p>This graduation and reunion is not just about our time</p>
<p>at Haas, it like literally can&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>We saw the death of 6 million people world wide</p>
<p>and a million in the US alone from COVID.</p>
<p>So, how do you move forward?</p>
<p>How do you keep going?</p>
<p>How do you celebrate our accomplishments</p>
<p>without it being a self-serving pat on the back?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s war, racism, income and gender inequality,</p>
<p>capital insurrection, refugee displacement</p>
<p>and climate change that continues to rage on.</p>
<p>What are our answers?</p>
<p>Did y&rsquo;all read this case?</p>
<p>Did Elon tweet out a solution yet?</p>
<p>Like how could anyone possibly summarize an answer?</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t, but you, the individual don&rsquo;t have to,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t have to do it alone.</p>
<p>Behind countless heated exec Zoom calls</p>
<p>is a working totally drained parent</p>
<p>from managing a household of kids,</p>
<p>who after the call sizing into their chair saying fudge.</p>
<p>At hospitals, text nurses, doctors are all burnt out.</p>
<p>They might find themselves returning home to a parent</p>
<p>or loved one just to have to care for them again.</p>
<p>Restaurant workers saw their lives flipped upside down</p>
<p>as shops closed, and their stability fell to jeopardy.</p>
<p>People just like you and me</p>
<p>had to postpone seeing at risk family members for years,</p>
<p>missing holidays, birthdays and time together,</p>
<p>which is way more valuable than Bitcoin will ever be.</p>
<p>And COVID, in this time period has stripped us down</p>
<p>to our core, our exposed vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>And one second.</p>
<p>And our last walls, we&rsquo;ve built to preserve</p>
<p>our outward appearances are starting to crumble.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m in MBA, I got promoted,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on LinkedIn, do you agree?</p>
<p>Those walls have begun to crumble and it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;re tearing down these walls</p>
<p>and inviting strangers in,</p>
<p>sometimes into our literal homes to see our humanity,</p>
<p>the good, the bad, the screaming baby</p>
<p>or parent in the background.</p>
<p>And then there was this realization.</p>
<p>There were shared flaws, worries, anxieties</p>
<p>that although they&rsquo;re not the resume highlights</p>
<p>we proudly share on LinkedIn</p>
<p>or the ones we shared with Haas to get in,</p>
<p>they are just as much a part of you and arguably more so.</p>
<p>And from there, I think we can see each other as humans</p>
<p>with more or less the same struggles, goals, and hopes.</p>
<p>Now I ask to raise your hands if you have struggles.</p>
<p>Like look around,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably like every hands,</p>
<p>now I ask to keep that hands raised if you got them,</p>
<p>and if you have hopes, and it&rsquo;s basically everyone,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re basically the same in this way.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s see if this works,</p>
<p>yeah, so I&rsquo;ll break this down real quick.</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all can hear?</p>
<p>So, Haas, it&rsquo;s students faculty,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s principles and it&rsquo;s community taught me</p>
<p>to show up as my most authentic self</p>
<p>and to be a more empathetic person and friend,</p>
<p>and brother and son and leader.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m still technically an analyst, just to be clear,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the fifth defining principles.</p>
<p>And the lessons I learned at Haas taught me in COVID</p>
<p>to tear down my own walls and invite people in</p>
<p>and see them as complex three dimensional beings</p>
<p>that they truly are off the screen.</p>
<p>Because in Berkeley, you have to walk a mile</p>
<p>in someone&rsquo;s Birkenstocks to see who they are.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve gotta try to make this big, scary world</p>
<p>a little more familiar, a little smaller.</p>
<p>Now, we can&rsquo;t do it alone,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve all got to do is try to help each other</p>
<p>and decide what to do with the time that&rsquo;s given to us.</p>
<p>So, congrats Haas and thank you for your time.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>Lot of stuff up here now.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<ul>
<li>So, I think Joe is definitely Dean material.</li>
</ul>
<p>So now we turn to the full-time MBA Class of 2021.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>You spent the second half of your MBA program</p>
<p>studying remotely, working remotely,</p>
<p>taking meetings by Zoom and then studying remotely at night</p>
<p>or over the weekend, it was not for the faint of heart,</p>
<p>but you persevered and you made it work,</p>
<p>showing the kind of confidence</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t require attitude,</p>
<p>you nourished your connections to your classmates</p>
<p>and built a community that will serve you a lifetime.</p>
<p>We are proud of you.</p>
<p>You also went above and beyond yourselves.</p>
<p>So, let us recognize these fearless leaders</p>
<p>with our Defining Leadership Principle awards.</p>
<p>Again, as I announced the recipients of the DLP awards,</p>
<p>will they please stand.</p>
<p>Again, I ask our guests to hold your applause</p>
<p>until I&rsquo;ve read all the names.</p>
<p>I also ask our recipients to remain standing</p>
<p>until all of the awards are announced.</p>
<p>The recipient of the Question the Status Quo Award</p>
<p>is Fayzan Gowani.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>Fayzan served as VP of education for Q{Haas</p>
<p>and work diligently to build expertise in understanding</p>
<p>and mitigating bias in artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>As part of the Q community,</p>
<p>as a South Asian who has lived outside the United States</p>
<p>and as a Muslim, Feizan amplified the voices of others</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t always feel comfortable raising their own.</p>
<p>The next award is for Confidence Without Attitude.</p>
<p>For the class of 2021,</p>
<p>the recipient of that is Fede Pacheco.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>Fede was a story salon coach who put his whole heart</p>
<p>into helping speakers tell their best stories.</p>
<p>He consistently took the initiative</p>
<p>to bring people together,</p>
<p>for his classmates, he was a mentor always.</p>
<p>Finally, Students Always,</p>
<p>and the recipient of that award is Jose Ramon Avellana.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>In nominating Jose, his classmates said you could feel</p>
<p>how deeply committed Jose was to the learning of others.</p>
<p>He served as a consortium liaison,</p>
<p>a member of the Diversity Admissions Council,</p>
<p>a dialogues on race facilitator,</p>
<p>a leadership communications GSI,</p>
<p>and a Haas undergraduate URM mentor.</p>
<p>Actually, I have one more award,</p>
<p>the Beyond Yourself Award.</p>
<p>The Beyond Yourself Award goes to Kendall Bills.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>Kendall served in numerous formal roles</p>
<p>that reflected her commitment to equity and inclusion.</p>
<p>But her classmates also spoke of the informal ways</p>
<p>in which she engaged personally in showing compassion,</p>
<p>building community and in her advocacy and allyship</p>
<p>for social and racial justice.</p>
<p>Congratulations to all our award winners.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>You may be seated.</p>
<p>And now the academic achievement award for the student</p>
<p>with the highest GPA of the class of 2021,</p>
<p>this award goes to Devan Courtois.</p>
<p>Devan.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>Devan had a GPA of 3.974.</p>
<p>So now, we will hear from the graduating student speaker</p>
<p>for the full-time MBA class of 2021, Fede Pacheco.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>Fede is now a partner and channel marketing manager</p>
<p>at Microsoft.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s bringing the confidence without the attitude</p>
<p>that he unfailingly showed at Haas.</p>
<p>About Fede, one of his classmates wrote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I think about someone who has most contributed</p>
<p>to my learning and my growth at Haas it would be Fede,</p>
<p>and I am positive I am not alone in saying that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Please join me in welcoming Fede Pacheco.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<ul>
<li>This is so cool.</li>
</ul>
<p>I told my mom, if I start speaking in Spanish,</p>
<p>like wave at me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a couple of days ago,</p>
<p>it feels that</p>
<p>I hear in the school of defining principles</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your defining moment?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s week zero.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually week minus one,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in the fourth day of Matt Verbal Camp,</p>
<p>and I gotta share my defining moment with someone</p>
<p>in the room, no idea who it is,</p>
<p>I only known everyone for a week or so.</p>
<p>So, I subconsciously start walking towards the left</p>
<p>of the Anderson auditorium towards the exit, unvoluntarily.</p>
<p>And I see, Aisha, standing right next to her,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not worried about what I&rsquo;ll say.</p>
<p>I know exactly the story that I could share,</p>
<p>and Don Moore told me once that I was too trusting,</p>
<p>so I wasn&rsquo;t concerned about sharing the story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m mostly concerned with is it a story worth sharing?</p>
<p>Is this something that she&rsquo;ll remember?</p>
<p>Would it means something to her?</p>
<p>And then she goes, you go first.</p>
<p>I wish I could tell myself so many things at that moment</p>
<p>about all the defining moments</p>
<p>that I would have from that moment,</p>
<p>and everybody in the room would have from that moment,</p>
<p>and for the next two years.</p>
<p>Only a couple of weeks later,</p>
<p>I would find myself in microeconomics class,</p>
<p>the professor would say, talk amongst yourselves,</p>
<p>what would you do?</p>
<p>And I turn right, and naturally,</p>
<p>that person is already talking to the other person.</p>
<p>So, I turn left and I see David Brown-Dawson, DBD.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, no, no, you weren&rsquo;t my plan B, let me explain.</p>
<p>But I naturally started thinking,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re gonna get caught cold here,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve also never introduced myself,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who he is, like, how do we do this?</p>
<p>Like I read the case, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna sound like too nerdy,</p>
<p>but also, like I&rsquo;m not, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>like so many thoughts in my head at that moment.</p>
<p>I wish I could tell myself that it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>what happened in that moment.</p>
<p>First of all, because if we get caught cold,</p>
<p>Oski will clap anyway.</p>
<p>And mostly because I would run into him</p>
<p>many, many more times in the MBA journey,</p>
<p>through serious negotiation classes about selling a bike</p>
<p>that had to be yellow or light green or something.</p>
<p>And also in some breakout rooms</p>
<p>where we would all both admit that we did not read the case</p>
<p>and maybe just catch up after long, long time</p>
<p>having not seeing each other there.</p>
<p>It feels like it was the exact next day</p>
<p>when my phone vibrates and I&rsquo;m all trapped in my apartment</p>
<p>and I get a message from Ade saying,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, I got the job, I&rsquo;m so happy.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I think that I&rsquo;m so happy for her,</p>
<p>as an international student getting your first job in the US</p>
<p>at Microsoft and same OPT.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just a perfect journey for her,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m so grateful,</p>
<p>especially cause I feel like I did nothing,</p>
<p>I only told her what I did to get rejected.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cause I had the interview like the week before</p>
<p>and it starts coming to my head</p>
<p>that I am still not there yet.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s quite the journey that I would face</p>
<p>for the next weeks and months</p>
<p>and what seemed like ages until I find my own path.</p>
<p>And we all find our own struggling path</p>
<p>across canceled internship, canceled interviews</p>
<p>and all that craziness.</p>
<p>I wish I could tell myself that it&rsquo;ll all right</p>
<p>at the end and we will all find our own path.</p>
<p>And just time flies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s April, 2021, and I am entering this packed bar</p>
<p>for the first time in century maybe.</p>
<p>And I see my PowerPoint magic crew, Johnny and Kevin,</p>
<p>and I see stories on coaches and my study team</p>
<p>and cohort friends,</p>
<p>and I just see everybody and I&rsquo;m so overwhelmed</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause there&rsquo;s so many people I want to catch up with.</p>
<p>It feels like that sunny shining courtyard in first year.</p>
<p>It actually feels like that today,</p>
<p>even with the second years here.</p>
<p>So memorable because I remember that feeling of,</p>
<p>oh, I actually have friends,</p>
<p>I actually have a couple of people I could talk to here</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t met him for more than a week.</p>
<p>And what I remember the most about that night</p>
<p>is that in April of 2021,</p>
<p>we were all talking about how exciting it would be</p>
<p>and how we would survive the next following weeks,</p>
<p>and not talking about all that we missed</p>
<p>and all that we could have had</p>
<p>and all the things that should have been better,</p>
<p>and if only this or that,</p>
<p>and we would hop on a bus to go to camp</p>
<p>and have the Haas roast</p>
<p>and the rematch of the cohort Olympics</p>
<p>and the Backstreet Boys one more time,</p>
<p>and to listen to the lyrics of the Red Haas Chili Peppers</p>
<p>one more time.</p>
<p>I wish I could slow down every second of those weeks</p>
<p>until that truly remarkable Haas boats for one last time</p>
<p>that not that powerless, crooked sinking boat would ruin,</p>
<p>not at all, not a story worth sharing today.</p>
<p>So many little but significant defining moments</p>
<p>through two years, that we could characterize</p>
<p>as many things, unprecedented, or any other buzzwords.</p>
<p>I wish I could tell myself all that and more</p>
<p>when I hear you go first, and especially when I hear,</p>
<p>I should say you go first,</p>
<p>I wanna tell myself how defining that conversation,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter again what I say,</p>
<p>it would form such an important bond in only a few minutes</p>
<p>that would define not only my friendship with that person,</p>
<p>but how I see Haas, how I see our class</p>
<p>and how I would trust all of you so much.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I want to remind myself when somebody asks,</p>
<p>what was your MBA like?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s so, so, so, so, so hard to separate that joy</p>
<p>with pain and the grieve of the what could have been</p>
<p>or how it could been.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve chosen to do and decided to do,</p>
<p>this is very important, so I&rsquo;m gonna at channel all of you,</p>
<p>sorry Bing, sorry ADT.</p>
<p>It is a defined moment all ready.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all here today</p>
<p>deciding whether we choose to relive it with joy</p>
<p>or with a little bit of something else.</p>
<p>And I know what I want,</p>
<p>what I feel when I see all of you from here</p>
<p>is that I&rsquo;m so excited to have one more weekend</p>
<p>today, tomorrow,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so excited to listen to the Oski chant one more time</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m so excited for one more (speaks foreign language).</p>
<p>thank you.</p>
<p>(students clapping)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you so much Fede,</li>
</ul>
<p>I will also think about what you said,</p>
<p>to remember the moments of joy</p>
<p>and not dwell on the moments of pain</p>
<p>and sacrifice and the challenges.</p>
<p>So, the moment you have all been waiting for,</p>
<p>at least, I think some of you have been waiting for</p>
<p>has arrived, we will now recognize the full-time candidates</p>
<p>for the class of 2020 and 2021</p>
<p>for the degree Master of Business Administration,</p>
