It&amp;rsquo;s Hardcore History Addendum.
‚ô™‚ô™
I have threatened for a long time
to introduce a bunch of sort of niche subjects
into the Hardcore History Addendum feed.
That&amp;rsquo;s why we established this alternative,
uh, feed to begin with, right?
So instead of having to have a show that could,
you know, hold one&amp;rsquo;s attention for four or five hours
or multi-parts in a series,
something we could just do as a throwaway&amp;hellip;'>

    <p>‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Hardcore History Addendum.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>I have threatened for a long time</p>
<p>to introduce a bunch of sort of niche subjects</p>
<p>into the Hardcore History Addendum feed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we established this alternative,</p>
<p>uh, feed to begin with, right?</p>
<p>So instead of having to have a show that could,</p>
<p>you know, hold one&rsquo;s attention for four or five hours</p>
<p>or multi-parts in a series,</p>
<p>something we could just do as a throwaway&hellip;</p>
<p>you know, sort of a, it&rsquo;ll be somebody&rsquo;s favorite show</p>
<p>someday kind of show, but not necessarily</p>
<p>a broad appeal show when we release it.</p>
<p>And I think today&rsquo;s might fit that bill.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been threatening to do a show on boxing</p>
<p>for a long time, and this is a show on boxing.</p>
<p>But I think the way we&rsquo;re gonna frame it</p>
<p>might drag a bunch of you non-boxing fans</p>
<p>into the conversation also.</p>
<p>And I was trying to think of the logical starting point</p>
<p>to this, and I&rsquo;m gonna say maybe the middle 1990s,</p>
<p>where I had one of those conversations</p>
<p>that every one of you out there that&rsquo;s a sports fan</p>
<p>has probably had at one time or another.</p>
<p>It just happened to be with somebody</p>
<p>who I thought was particularly, uh, well-suited</p>
<p>to explain to me the intricacies of the situation.</p>
<p>In the middle 1990s, I was, um, I had a radio show</p>
<p>that bumped up against a sports show right afterwards.</p>
<p>And the sports show right afterwards was hosted</p>
<p>by a former NFL football player who played</p>
<p>in the 1970s and the 1980s.</p>
<p>And this, as I said, was the 1990s.</p>
<p>Uh, the football player&rsquo;s name was Russ Francis,</p>
<p>and Russ was a tight end with the New England Patriots,</p>
<p>and then with the San Francisco 49ers.</p>
<p>And he won a Super Bowl with the 49ers.</p>
<p>And Russ and I would often just sort of chit-chat</p>
<p>between the shows a little bit.</p>
<p>And then one day we got into this subject,</p>
<p>and he became so heated, and so into the conversation</p>
<p>that he just said, because his show was about to start,</p>
<p>um, and normally we would have cut our conversation off</p>
<p>by that point, you just need to come on</p>
<p>and we just need to continue this discussion</p>
<p>from where we&rsquo;re having it.</p>
<p>Because he was so worked up over it.</p>
<p>But I understand why, especially because it did,</p>
<p>it literally was questioning whether or not</p>
<p>he was good enough to play, you know, currently.</p>
<p>Now, currently at that time was like the middle 1990s,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a 20th century currently,</p>
<p>as opposed to the 21st century now.</p>
<p>But the subject is timeless, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Could the people from the past match up today</p>
<p>with the modern baseball players,</p>
<p>or basketball players, or football players,</p>
<p>or track and field athletes, right?</p>
<p>Just standard conversation.</p>
<p>And the general attitude out there,</p>
<p>if I could, um, you know, sum up the majority viewpoint,</p>
<p>is that they could not.</p>
<p>Or, conversely, that the very best of an earlier era</p>
<p>would be an average player today.</p>
<p>So, yes, maybe some people from the 1950s or 1960s</p>
<p>could play in the NFL today, right?</p>
<p>The great Jim Brown could play in the NFL today,</p>
<p>but he wouldn&rsquo;t be the great Jim Brown,</p>
<p>he might be the more average Jim Brown.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how that line of thinking goes.</p>
<p>Now, Russ Francis&rsquo; viewpoint, as you might imagine,</p>
<p>was, you&rsquo;re darn right the people from the 70s,</p>
<p>at least, could play in the middle 1990s.</p>
<p>And Russ got really animated about what makes</p>
<p>a good football player and all these things.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t always, as you might imagine,</p>
<p>the measurables, the weight, the height, the speed,</p>
<p>how high they jumped, all that stuff.</p>
<p>A lot of it was the intangibles, right?</p>
<p>The attitude, the toughness, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But I mean, I remember specifically,</p>
<p>we mentioned Jack Lambert, who, even in the 1970s,</p>
<p>was an undersized linebacker for the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>
<p>I think he was like 215 or something.</p>
<p>And, um, you know, Russ was like,</p>
<p>are you telling me Jack Lambert can&rsquo;t play?</p>
<p>And maybe you moved Jack Lambert to a different position, right?</p>
<p>Maybe today he&rsquo;s a strong safety, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But in a sport like football, at a certain point,</p>
<p>the players from the past are just gonna be</p>
<p>too slow to compete, right?</p>
<p>Or you&rsquo;re either big or you&rsquo;re fast,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not big and fast, and today,</p>
<p>they are big and fast.</p>
<p>So, football&rsquo;s a perfect example of a sport</p>
<p>where the players of yesteryear, on average,</p>
<p>were a lot smaller, a lot slower, maybe less athletic.</p>
<p>Certainly, not taking advantage of the latest nutrition</p>
<p>and training methods and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And I think you could pretty much make a case</p>
<p>that that same sort of state of affairs</p>
<p>is the same situation you will find in 99 percent</p>
<p>of the sports and athletic competitions out there.</p>
<p>Except for one exception.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I think makes it kind of an interesting</p>
<p>conversation today, and that exception</p>
<p>is amongst boxers.</p>
<p>Professional fighters who box.</p>
<p>And I say that because MMA and all those things</p>
<p>are very big today, but that&rsquo;s not boxing.</p>
<p>Boxing, by the way, is an age-old sport.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s understand that. I mean, you can go to your&hellip;</p>
<p>I was just at the, um&hellip;</p>
<p>art museum, the Met in New York, and they had a statue</p>
<p>of a Greek Olympian boxer from like the 400s BCEs.</p>
<p>And you see from a distance that he&rsquo;s a boxer.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still got&hellip; They didn&rsquo;t wear boxing gloves,</p>
<p>they would just sort of wrap their knuckles and stuff,</p>
<p>but you see it from a distance, you know,</p>
<p>wow, that&rsquo;s a boxer.</p>
<p>So it goes back a long way.</p>
<p>And boxing has certain elements in the sport</p>
<p>that make it inherently exciting,</p>
<p>and something that it&rsquo;s hard to take your eyes off of.</p>
<p>So forget what&rsquo;s involved in terms of the fighting part</p>
<p>for a minute, and just look at the rules of the game</p>
<p>and see how different boxing is.</p>
<p>So, for example, I can&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>and maybe I&rsquo;m overlooking an obvious example,</p>
<p>so I apologize if I am, I can&rsquo;t think of another sport</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s no minimum time limit.</p>
<p>Where you can sit down at a match or a game,</p>
<p>and it can be over in one second.</p>
<p>Right? You buy the ticket, you take the commute,</p>
<p>you buy the popcorn, you sit down,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re ready to enjoy the show,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s over right when it starts.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of another sport that does that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s boxing.</p>
<p>Famously, happens all the time.</p>
<p>First round knockout.</p>
<p>How quickly did Mike Tyson knock out Michael Spinks?</p>
<p>Was it like 90 seconds?</p>
<p>That happened to Floyd Patterson twice</p>
<p>against Sonny Liston, right? Boom, over.</p>
<p>And you might say, well, that&rsquo;s a rip-off,</p>
<p>yet at the same time, it forces you to be interested.</p>
<p>Anything could happen at any time, right?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just take your eyes off it</p>
<p>like a tennis match for a while.</p>
<p>You might miss a point. No, you might miss the fight.</p>
<p>And that works very well with the other part</p>
<p>of the rules of boxing that make it inherently more watchable</p>
<p>than a lot of other sports, and that is that you can never</p>
<p>get so far behind that you can&rsquo;t instantly win.</p>
<p>You could be down the equivalent of a hundred to nothing,</p>
<p>with, you know, 30 seconds left, and win.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s happened a lot of times, too.</p>
<p>I mean, most famously, and I had a friend</p>
<p>in the bathroom when it happened,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a perfect example to use,</p>
<p>was when George Foreman won his second</p>
<p>heavyweight championship of the world,</p>
<p>and he was in, like, mid-40s, 45 years old, I think,</p>
<p>so that was part of the storyline.</p>
<p>And he was fighting a much younger fighter, of course,</p>
<p>much better shape, more modern and trained,</p>
<p>the whole thing, and, uh, George lost every round.</p>
<p>I mean, it was a wipeout. My friend goes to the bathroom,</p>
<p>the fight&rsquo;s almost over, and George Foreman,</p>
<p>with, well, as far as the audience was concerned,</p>
<p>with two punches, puts the heavyweight champion</p>
<p>of the world down on his back.</p>
<p>The heavyweight champion of the world does not get up,</p>
<p>and George Foreman is the champion.</p>
<p>After losing, a hundred to nothing</p>
<p>would have been the equivalent.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s gonna make the kind of sport right there,</p>
<p>regardless of what it is you do in the sport,</p>
<p>inherently kind of interesting and dramatic.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m going to sound like a NASCAR fan when I say this,</p>
<p>because the car racing fans always tell</p>
<p>the non-car racing fans, you know,</p>
<p>I know you think we&rsquo;re watching for the crashes,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not. Um, it&rsquo;s the same way with me and boxing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not watching for the violence.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s hard to believe. I don&rsquo;t like the violence.</p>
<p>And fights where it gets too violent,</p>
<p>I look at as the kind of things you stop.</p>
<p>Right? When one person is outclassed, you stop it.</p>
<p>But I got interested in boxing like so many</p>
<p>of my generation did, when there was a transcendental figure</p>
<p>in the sport. Somebody that just pulled, famously,</p>
<p>pulled in non-boxing fans.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, Muhammad Ali was huge.</p>
<p>He was probably the biggest sporting figure,</p>
<p>arguably the biggest sporting figure who&rsquo;s ever lived.</p>
<p>Top five, certainly. And so, during the time period</p>
<p>when I was growing up, I might have had no interest</p>
<p>in boxing at all, but I had an interest in him.</p>
<p>And, you know, you combine some of the things people like</p>
<p>about someone like Conor McGregor and all these,</p>
<p>you know, quippy, funny, can&rsquo;t take your eyes off him,</p>
<p>very entertaining, you like him, he sets up, or you hate him,</p>
<p>and he sets up the drama for the fight.</p>
<p>One of his idols, or one of the people he modeled</p>
<p>his whole shtick after, was the professional wrestler,</p>
<p>Gorgeous George. So there was all of those elements</p>
<p>in play where he got you wanting to watch the fight.</p>
<p>And then over time, as you watch enough Muhammad Ali fights,</p>
<p>you start noticing the intricacies of the sport,</p>
<p>which is always sort of the key, right?</p>
<p>The pathway to becoming a fan of any sport,</p>
<p>understanding the little things, the chrome.</p>
<p>And for me, what A.J. Liebling referred to</p>
<p>as the sweet science, became endlessly fascinating, right?</p>
<p>The idea of brain over brawn, of people who were smaller,</p>
<p>or weaker, or less athletic, but because they were</p>
<p>better craftsmen, could beat the, um, you know,</p>
<p>the bullies in the ring.</p>
<p>I mean, it was, there became a lot of reasons</p>
<p>to find the sport attractive.</p>
<p>And over time, I&rsquo;ve found myself looking at it</p>
<p>more and more like, um, the old line.</p>
<p>There was a fight fan, a famous fight fan,</p>
<p>who said that boxing was his guilty pleasure.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s more and more guilt and a lot less pleasure.</p>
<p>Especially nowadays when, um, to quote Mike Silver,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a famous, uh, knowledgeable boxing historian</p>
<p>and writer, uh, it&rsquo;s like a human demolition derby</p>
<p>out there now, and that&rsquo;s not what I watch it for.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t wanna see a bunch of guys</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t have any good defense, uh, getting hit</p>
<p>all over the place, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the sweet science anymore at that point.</p>
<p>In any case, that&rsquo;s how I got into the sport.</p>
<p>And like everything I do, and I know many of you,</p>
<p>once I get into something like this, the history of it,</p>
<p>and learning about the early days,</p>
<p>and how we got from there to here,</p>
<p>all that stuff becomes endlessly fascinating to me.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve long read a lot about the subject</p>
<p>and paid attention to old fight films</p>
<p>and tried to educate myself.</p>
<p>And in reading one of my favorite books</p>
<p>on the entire subject of boxing, I came across</p>
<p>that Russ Francis, could the athletes of the past</p>
<p>compete with the athletes of today argument,</p>
<p>in a book that I just thought made</p>
<p>the most counterintuitive case you&rsquo;ve ever heard</p>
<p>on the subject.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re into boxing, especially,</p>
<p>any kind of combat sports, or the subject in general</p>
<p>of, you know, human athletic performance over time,</p>
<p>um, you might really enjoy Mike Silver&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>The Arc of Boxing, The Rise and Decline</p>
<p>of the Sweet Science.</p>
<p>Now, Silver is a famous guy in the boxing world.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been a promoter, an inspector</p>
<p>with the New York State Athletic Commission,</p>
<p>lots of articles on boxing,</p>
<p>everything from the New York Times, Ring Magazine,</p>
<p>Boxing Monthly, ESPN.</p>
<p>Um, the guy is a known boxing expert.</p>
<p>And what he does in this book, is try to make a case</p>
<p>that boxing is the one athletic competition</p>
<p>in the modern world, where the people of the past</p>
<p>are superior to the people who do it today.</p>
<p>And the argument isn&rsquo;t just fascinating,</p>
<p>but the way he makes it is too.</p>
<p>He went, as anyone, you know, when you step out</p>
<p>and think about it, and say,</p>
<p>well, who&rsquo;s qualified to make this case?</p>
<p>And the answer is, no one person is.</p>
<p>So, Silver went out and got multiple,</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s like 20 to 30, uh, trainers,</p>
<p>former champions of the past, promoters,</p>
<p>experts on the subject,</p>
<p>and brought them into the conversation</p>
<p>in a kind of a blended oral history,</p>
<p>where they help make a lot of the points.</p>
<p>And it is absolutely fascinating.</p>
<p>The first part to understand is that in most of boxing,</p>
<p>it is absolutely a perfect setup to have comparison</p>
<p>of performance over the eras,</p>
<p>because most of boxing has weight classes, right?</p>
<p>So, if you are fighting in the 140-pound weight class today,</p>
<p>well, we can compare you to a boxer fighting</p>
<p>in the 140-pound weight class 50 years ago, right?</p>
<p>The whole bigger, stronger, faster dynamic</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t apply as much when you&rsquo;re taking into account</p>
<p>people of the same weight over eras, right?</p>
<p>In football today, your average offensive line</p>
<p>is probably like six-foot-six,</p>
<p>whereas 50 or 60 years ago, it was probably like six-foot-two.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no rule on that,</p>
<p>so it just keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>But a 140-pound weight class is a pretty hard limit, right?</p>
<p>So, the fact that boxing has weight classes like that</p>
<p>is a better apples-and-apples comparison</p>
<p>over the different eras,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re wanting to get into training</p>
<p>and nutrition and all the intangibles.</p>
<p>But even, and I find this to be perhaps</p>
<p>the most shocking aspect of what Mike Silver is saying</p>
<p>in the art of boxing, even in the one category</p>
<p>where there, you know, it&rsquo;s everything like 190</p>
<p>or 187 in the old days and above,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t matter how big you are,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s suggesting that the people of the past</p>
<p>would destroy the people of the present.</p>
<p>I mean, look at the size of the world today.</p>
<p>Look at the present. I mean, look at the size differences.</p>
<p>And I, you know, when you want to talk about something</p>
<p>as nuanced and as intricate,</p>
<p>and that involves as many different factors,</p>
<p>including the history of the sport as this,</p>
<p>you want to get experts on the same way</p>
<p>that Mike Silver wanted to get experts on</p>
<p>to help make his case.</p>
<p>I want to get experts on to help make my case.</p>
<p>So, we talked to Mike Silver for a little bit</p>
<p>about some of this stuff.</p>
<p>For example, giant heavyweights of today</p>
<p>fighting not-so-giant heavyweights of the past.</p>
<p>I was watching a fight the other night on YouTube,</p>
<p>and an older one, it&rsquo;s funny saying older one,</p>
<p>about a Tyson Fury, Deontay Wilder fight.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a six-foot, nine-inch tall guy</p>
<p>with an 85-inch reach against a six-foot, seven-inch guy</p>
<p>with an 83-inch reach.</p>
<p>How could somebody like a Joe Lewis,</p>
<p>from one of the great ages of boxing,</p>
<p>and one of the great heavyweight champions,</p>
<p>at like six-foot, one-and-a-half, 76-inch reach,</p>
<p>could a guy like that compete</p>
<p>with those two massive modern boxers?</p>
<p>Okay, well, Joe Lewis did fight two opponents</p>
<p>who were pretty much the same size.</p>
<p>Um, one was Primo Carnera,</p>
<p>who was about six-foot, six inches,</p>
<p>weighed 270 pounds.</p>
<p>And Lewis annihilated him in six rounds.</p>
<p>The fight&rsquo;s on YouTube, you can check it out.</p>
<p>Another was Buddy Bear,</p>
<p>who I believe was six-foot, seven inches tall,</p>
<p>weighed about 250 pounds.</p>
<p>And, uh, Lewis stopped him first time in the sixth round,</p>
<p>and the second time in the first round.</p>
<p>Okay, the problem is that many people think that&hellip;</p>
<p>size is everything in boxing.</p>
<p>If somebody&rsquo;s&hellip; Let me put it this way.</p>
<p>The old adage, a good big fighter</p>
<p>can always defeat a good little fighter,</p>
<p>provided they are equal in ability, okay?</p>
<p>But in the case of these big heavyweights,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll give Tyson Fury his due,</p>
<p>he moves very unusual for a guy his size.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s light on his feet, he moves around,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not a stationary target.</p>
<p>But, you know, he was dropped twice,</p>
<p>two or three times by Wilder.</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s a question of,</p>
<p>can the smaller fighter,</p>
<p>who is more accomplished as a boxer,</p>
<p>knows how to get under the punches, get inside?</p>
<p>Um, a guy that size, you could say,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s say somebody 200 pounds, six-foot-one,</p>
<p>a really outstanding heavyweight is fighting</p>
<p>a larger opponent who doesn&rsquo;t have his skill.</p>
<p>That smaller opponent will see that big guy</p>
<p>as just a bigger target.</p>
<p>He would actually have&hellip;</p>
<p>Lewis had more trouble with smaller quick fighters</p>
<p>than he did with huge monsters like, um,</p>
<p>uh, Carnera and Buddy Bear.</p>
<p>The same thing with Jack Dempsey,</p>
<p>whose nickname was the Giant Killer.</p>
<p>Uh, Jack Dempsey, when he won the title,</p>
<p>beat, he weighed about 185 pounds.</p>
<p>Tremendous puncher, very fast.</p>
<p>And he annihilated, uh, Jess Willard,</p>
<p>who was six-foot, six, over six-foot, six inches tall,</p>
<p>and 250 pounds.</p>
<p>That film is available on YouTube.</p>
<p>LAZARTE You quote Georgie Benton saying,</p>
<p>famously, too, that if you&rsquo;re over 200 pounds,</p>
<p>you have all the power you need,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t matter how much bigger</p>
<p>the opponent gets at that point.</p>
<p>FUCHS That&rsquo;s true. It&rsquo;s a matter of physics.</p>
<p>Now, look, if you&rsquo;re gonna match</p>
<p>a 125-pound featherweight against a 160-pound middleweight,</p>
<p>then you got a problem.</p>
<p>Because that 125-pound featherweight</p>
<p>just doesn&rsquo;t have enough mass to, uh,</p>
<p>and musculature to generate, to hurt that 160-pound fighter.</p>
<p>Uh, you know, it just would be uneven.</p>
<p>But Benton is right. Once you get to 200 pounds,</p>
<p>you have enough mass and muscularity and strength</p>
<p>to hurt anybody.</p>
<p>Especially if you can put that 200 pounds</p>
<p>into a punch, as Joe Louis did.</p>
<p>And so, as a Marciano, who weighed about 190 pounds&hellip;</p>
<p>LAZARTE Had about a 68-inch reach.</p>
<p>FUCHS Right, the short-shortest reach</p>
<p>of any heavyweight champion in history.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s, you know, I, in my book,</p>
<p>in the arc of boxing, I, I went into boxing history</p>
<p>and listed about 50 fights, 50.</p>
<p>Where, down through the years,</p>
<p>where a fighter, a heavyweight, was outweighed</p>
<p>from anywhere from 25 to 100 pounds.</p>
<p>Okay, where the smaller opponent defeated</p>
<p>the heavier opponent.</p>
<p>And in, in, in each case, these, you know,</p>
<p>nowadays, if you would look at those matches on paper,</p>
<p>you would say, no way is that 195 to 210-pound heavyweight</p>
<p>going to take apart this 275-pound heavyweight.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not the way it happened.</p>
<p>Boxing is an art and a science.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s speed involved, there&rsquo;s, uh, technique,</p>
<p>and, very important, heart, the ability to take a punch.</p>
<p>Um&hellip;</p>
<p>LAZARTE Experience.</p>
<p>FUCHS And, of course, experience,</p>
<p>naturally, experience.</p>
<p>All these come into play&hellip;</p>
<p>LAZARTE To give you an idea of how much</p>
<p>this taller, faster, stronger dynamic has been around,</p>
<p>this idea that if you just get bigger people,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll naturally be the heavyweight champion</p>
<p>of the world. There was a fight that almost came off</p>
<p>that was going to happen between Muhammad Ali,</p>
<p>I think it was the early 70s, I&rsquo;m guessing here,</p>
<p>between Muhammad Ali and professional basketball player</p>
<p>Wilt Chamberlain.</p>
<p>Now, Wilt was a great all-around athlete,</p>
<p>over seven foot tall, and the idea was</p>
<p>that an over seven foot tall, great athlete</p>
<p>will give a professional boxer, who&rsquo;s more like six foot three,</p>
<p>a really hard time.</p>
<p>And the press conference gets set up,</p>
<p>and I guess the story is that Ali was being very good</p>
<p>on his best behavior, because he wanted the fight</p>
<p>to come off too, and when Wilt Chamberlain</p>
<p>entered the room, he stood up in front of the cameras,</p>
<p>pointed at him, and just yelled,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Timber!&rsquo; And the book I read said</p>
<p>Chamberlain&rsquo;s whole demeanor and color changed.</p>
<p>He turned around, walked out, the fight was off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So maybe even the bigger guy realizes</p>
<p>that size is just one factor when you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about something like boxing.</p>
<p>The experience question is much more fascinating</p>
<p>to me, though, and gets into some of these other issues</p>
<p>that take this out of the realm of a simple boxing,</p>
<p>or even a simple sports examination.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about human craftsmanship</p>
<p>involved here, and how deeply someone&rsquo;s knowledge</p>
<p>and how much experience can count.</p>
<p>So let me give you an example of what I mean.</p>
<p>And Silver is all over this in his book.</p>
<p>If I had to name the number one thing</p>
<p>that he considers the most important difference</p>
<p>for why a boxer of the past can overcome</p>
<p>any of the things, any of the advantages</p>
<p>a modern boxer would have, experience is the number one thing.</p>
<p>Because it is so incredibly different.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not a little bit more experience,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s multiples of the amount of experience.</p>
<p>So, for example, in the early days,</p>
<p>you had, just like you do today, you&rsquo;d have amateur boxing,</p>
<p>and a lot of these people would fight a lot of amateur fights,</p>
<p>like three-rounders.</p>
<p>And then they would move into the pros,</p>
<p>and they would fight unbelievable numbers of fights.</p>
<p>Harry Greb had 299 fights.</p>
<p>299 professional fights.</p>
<p>He won more than 260 of them, by the way.</p>
<p>Guys win championships today with 18 fights.</p>
<p>19 fights, 20 fights.</p>
<p>Now, you can be the greatest athlete</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ever been produced,</p>
<p>but a guy with 299 fights is going to have some tools</p>
<p>in his toolbox to offset your God-given natural abilities.</p>
<p>It just&hellip; First of all, to say that that&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>is to ignore how much better the modern-day fighter</p>
<p>with 18 or 20 fights would be</p>
<p>if you gave them 200 or 300 fights, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to be that much better, too.</p>
<p>So, the experience counts for something,</p>
<p>and you got a lot more of it back then.</p>
<p>Then you add another element that silver is all over,</p>
<p>and it is the kind of experience you get.</p>
<p>This is another aspect of sports training</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fascinating, far beyond just the niche of boxing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this idea about how much better competition</p>
<p>makes you better, right? How steel sharpens steel,</p>
<p>as the saying goes.</p>
<p>I think silver uses the analogy of playing tennis</p>
<p>with some people that are not as good as you are.</p>
<p>And over time, that means you&rsquo;re getting away with mistakes,</p>
<p>and your game gets sloppy, because it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re playing poorly, you&rsquo;re still going to win,</p>
<p>as opposed to playing against people</p>
<p>that are better than you are.</p>
<p>And simply to not embarrass yourself</p>
<p>and to have a chance of competing,</p>
<p>you have to really tighten your game up, right?</p>
<p>It encourages a better performance, right?</p>
<p>Steel sharpens steel.</p>
<p>But boxing doesn&rsquo;t even pretend to do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only sport I can think of where the idea</p>
<p>of having the best face the best</p>
<p>is not necessarily a hundred percent good thing.</p>
<p>There might be some downsides.</p>
<p>Do I really want my undefeated guy fighting</p>
<p>that really tough challenger who can beat him,</p>
<p>when I can have him fight a bunch of stiffs</p>
<p>who have no chance of beating him,</p>
<p>and make even more money, and not lose the championship?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a&hellip; Let&rsquo;s just say there&rsquo;s cross-purposes</p>
<p>on the question of steel sharpening steel</p>
<p>in boxing in a way that there isn&rsquo;t in most other sports.</p>
<p>Everyone understands that we&rsquo;ve expanded</p>
<p>the number of weight classes since the old days.</p>
<p>It used to be like eight, now there&rsquo;s a lot more than eight.</p>
<p>And we have more sanctioning bodies than ever, right?</p>
<p>You know, I can think of some off the top of my head,</p>
<p>WBC, WBA, IBC, IBF, I mean, just&hellip;</p>
<p>And all of them with their own champions,</p>
<p>and so we have a lot more challengers in the old days,</p>
<p>and a lot fewer championship slots.</p>
<p>Today, we have a lot more championship slots</p>
<p>for fewer challengers.</p>
<p>It means that the talent pool is diluted.</p>
<p>And in the old days, by the time somebody got a chance</p>
<p>to face the champion, to try to win the title,</p>
<p>they had had usually dozens more fights on average</p>
<p>than the people today, and they had fought people</p>
<p>who were, on average, themselves more battle-tested,</p>
<p>more experienced, and better fighters.</p>
<p>The steel had sharpened the steel,</p>
<p>and by the time you had people facing off at the top levels,</p>
<p>these were people who not only had tons of experience,</p>
<p>who not only had fought people that forced them</p>
<p>to up their game,</p>
<p>these are people that fought so often</p>
<p>that their skills were sharp.</p>
<p>And this is another one of those really unquantifiable things.</p>
<p>How do you try to figure out the difference</p>
<p>between a fighter that fights every three weeks,</p>
<p>and a fighter that fights twice a year?</p>
<p>You know it&rsquo;s going to have an impact,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t really quantify how much.</p>
<p>If a tennis player, to go back to the tennis analogy,</p>
<p>only had two tennis matches a year,</p>
<p>even if you practiced a lot, I&rsquo;m going to assume</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to be as sharp as if you had</p>
<p>three tennis matches a month, right?</p>
<p>In the old days, these guys fought a lot.</p>
<p>Nowadays, they don&rsquo;t fight much at all.</p>
<p>How much does something like that impact</p>
<p>what would happen if we could bring a fighter from the past,</p>
<p>out of the time machine today,</p>
<p>and put him in a ring with the fighters of the present?</p>
<p>Mike Silver had some thoughts about this question of sharpness</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s known as ring rust,</p>
<p>and what a difference it might have made.</p>
<p>‚ô™</p>
<p>And you brought up sharpness, too.</p>
<p>A lack of sharpness, because some of these fighters</p>
<p>back in the day, who were more like lunch pail,</p>
<p>go-to-work, hard hat type, blue collar guys,</p>
<p>are fighting every three weeks or something.</p>
<p>And these days, one of the great fighters</p>
<p>is probably going to have one or two fights a year.</p>
<p>How much does the ring rust kill you</p>
<p>in those kinds of situations?</p>
<p>I mean, if you bring your fighter back out of the&hellip;</p>
<p>If you bring Harry Greb out of the time machine today,</p>
<p>put him in against a welterweight or a middleweight today,</p>
<p>what are we going to notice?</p>
<p>I mean, is he a much better defensive fighter</p>
<p>than the modern guy?</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that going to look to us?</p>
<p>Harry Greb is not the perfect example to do that.</p>
<p>Harry Greb, like Muhammad Ali, like Henry Armstrong&hellip;</p>
<p>He was singular?</p>
<p>&hellip;had a style of his own.</p>
<p>It couldn&rsquo;t be duplicated.</p>
<p>He was an outlier.</p>
<p>He just&hellip; He had a style that nobody could solve.</p>
<p>Nobody could even imitate him successfully.</p>
<p>So, I would say go back to the more traditional fighters.</p>
<p>Tony Canzaneri.</p>
<p>Tony Canzaneri, Barney Ross, Mickey Walker.</p>
<p>Tommy Loughran.</p>
<p>Or even, you know, those type of fighters.</p>
<p>Ike Williams.</p>
<p>Benny Leonard, who looked like an insurance salesman.</p>
<p>Yes. Exactly. Exactly.</p>
<p>Just didn&rsquo;t look like a fighter at all.</p>
<p>But these&hellip; When you say about, you know,</p>
<p>fighting twice a year as opposed to, you know,</p>
<p>twice a month, which a lot of those guys did.</p>
<p>Well, one of the most important aspects</p>
<p>of being successful in boxing is timing.</p>
<p>Your ability to time a punch.</p>
<p>Okay? And there is such a thing as ring rust.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen it with&hellip;</p>
<p>when Muhammad Ali came back after three and a half year layoff.</p>
<p>He was rusty. He was getting hit with punches</p>
<p>that he never would have gotten hit with.</p>
<p>You know, you have to start fighting more often</p>
<p>to get your timing down,</p>
<p>your sense of judgment and distance.</p>
<p>This&hellip; With repetitive fights,</p>
<p>if you fight space not too far apart, this is automatic.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re only fighting two or three times a year,</p>
<p>fight space four or five months apart,</p>
<p>it becomes more difficult to get the timing down.</p>
<p>So, of course, the fighters who fought more often</p>
<p>would have a&hellip; That would be a distinct advantage.</p>
<p>Just in their sense of timing and ability to judge distance,</p>
<p>just because they were more active.</p>
<p>As I say, like anybody, whether it&rsquo;s a surgeon,</p>
<p>a doctor, a salesman, anybody who is doing it more often</p>
<p>will be more proficient at it.</p>
<p>In addition to the part where he&rsquo;s quoting</p>
<p>these many different expert voices,</p>
<p>which is extremely effective,</p>
<p>one of the other things that Silver will do sometimes</p>
<p>in the book, The Arc of Boxing,</p>
<p>is really utilize photographs in a way</p>
<p>that make his point for him.</p>
<p>And one of the ones that&rsquo;s the most jarring</p>
<p>is he has two photographs on opposite sides of the page</p>
<p>and on the left side is a picture of Sylvester Stallone</p>
<p>from one of the Rocky movies.</p>
<p>Not Rocky 1, one of the later ones.</p>
<p>And he looks like a giant, you know, bodybuilder.</p>
<p>Six-pack abs, big, you know, arms, the whole thing.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s flexing in the shot with a&hellip;</p>
<p>I think he has a championship belt around his waist.</p>
<p>This is the conception, right, of a boxer.</p>
<p>But on the right-hand side of the page</p>
<p>is an actual photo from the 1930s, I think,</p>
<p>of Jack Dempsey, the ferocious Jack Dempsey,</p>
<p>the guy Mike Tyson liked so much.</p>
<p>And with the exception of the peek-a-boo style,</p>
<p>which was a custom auto thing,</p>
<p>he often said he influenced his approach to, you know,</p>
<p>how he went after opponents,</p>
<p>to what Jack Dempsey did with both hands, right?</p>
<p>Punching with bad intentions.</p>
<p>But when you look at Dempsey&rsquo;s body,</p>
<p>especially juxtaposed next to the Rocky image,</p>
<p>which is our popular conception,</p>
<p>Jack Dempsey doesn&rsquo;t look like he&rsquo;s got a boxer&rsquo;s build</p>
<p>at all. And yet, Jack Dempsey has the right build</p>
<p>for boxing in the same way that there&rsquo;s a build you want,</p>
<p>or that you acquire naturally if you just swim</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re a swimmer.</p>
<p>In boxing, if you just do the boxing,</p>
<p>and the exercises that boxers have always done,</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things, you look like Jack Dempsey.</p>
<p>It was the introduction of a whole bunch of things</p>
<p>that boxers never did, like weight training,</p>
<p>that would turn, you know, somebody into</p>
<p>the Stallone, Hollywood caricature.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s weird. Silver says in his book</p>
<p>that people saw the Rocky movies, you know,</p>
<p>young boxers, and decided when they went into boxing</p>
<p>that they wanted to look like that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, you have this growth starting</p>
<p>in about the early 1980s with these, um,</p>
<p>real sort of fatty, let&rsquo;s call them fatty,</p>
<p>nutrition and strength experts. And don&rsquo;t get me wrong,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s real experts who go to school</p>
<p>for many, many years to do this job,</p>
<p>but what Silver points out is that unlike every other sport,</p>
<p>because of the interplay and all the different things</p>
<p>that go into boxing, it&rsquo;s really hard to just simply say,</p>
<p>wow, well, you need this muscle strength,</p>
<p>and so we&rsquo;ll develop a machine that just works that much.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really work that way.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, you&rsquo;re trying to do something in boxing</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t lend itself to most of the sort of strengthening</p>
<p>kinds of exercises that work out so well</p>
<p>in so many other sports. For example,</p>
<p>have you ever played a game of hot hands?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we call it in the U.S.,</p>
<p>although I know that the other countries</p>
<p>have different names. But it&rsquo;s the game</p>
<p>where you put your hands, palms up,</p>
<p>and then somebody puts their hands, palms down,</p>
<p>on your hands. And then you, the person</p>
<p>with the hands facing upward, try to slap the hands</p>
<p>of the person whose hands are touching yours</p>
<p>before they can pull their hands away.</p>
<p>If they pull their hands away and you fake them out,</p>
<p>you get to slap their hands. If they get slapped,</p>
<p>they have to keep playing. If they can pull</p>
<p>their hands away before you can slap them,</p>
<p>you have to exchange positions with them.</p>
<p>But that game is based on quick reflexes,</p>
<p>movement, and speed. You know, speed of using</p>
<p>your hands, right? That&rsquo;s a good analogy</p>
<p>for what boxing does well. And anything that would</p>
<p>slow down how quickly you could get your hands</p>
<p>out of the way in a game of hot hands</p>
<p>would also hurt you in a boxing match.</p>
<p>And interestingly enough, on another page,</p>
<p>Silver has a photo of a ballet dancer,</p>
<p>a male ballet dancer, who also used to happen</p>
<p>to be a boxer. And the ballet dancer talks about</p>
<p>how the very same sorts of strength and musculature</p>
<p>that a ballet dancer has is exactly the kind</p>
<p>that makes a killer boxer. And it looks much more</p>
<p>like Jack Dempsey than Rocky Balboa looks like,</p>
<p>you know, any of the boxers from the golden age</p>
<p>of boxing. The other thing that you don&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s another one of these aspects</p>
<p>of the lost martial arts. If you&rsquo;re a fan of, say,</p>
<p>Western sword fighting from the Middle Ages,</p>
<p>which I am, you&rsquo;ll know that that&rsquo;s a lost art.</p>
<p>That somewhere along the line, we stopped teaching people</p>
<p>the, you know, thousands of year old techniques</p>
<p>of fighting with a Western-style sword.</p>
<p>And experts have been trying, and reenactors</p>
<p>have been trying, through the use of the few</p>
<p>technical manuals that existed from back then,</p>
<p>to try to piece together what it must have been like, right?</p>
<p>Something that the Kendo swordsmen in the Far East</p>
<p>have managed to keep alive in terms of their timeline</p>
<p>of historical, you know, knowledge, the craft,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been lost in Western longsword fighting.</p>
<p>In the same way that the old trainers who used to train</p>
<p>all the great champions in what is universally acknowledged</p>
<p>as the golden age of boxing, their skills have died out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nobody to teach the young boxers today</p>
<p>the conditioning and the art itself.</p>
<p>The finer points is the way Mike Silver puts it, right?</p>
<p>The little teeny things that, you know,</p>
<p>when you add up all the little teeny things,</p>
<p>make all the difference in a big fight,</p>
<p>those people aren&rsquo;t around anymore.</p>
<p>They have literally gone the way of the dodo.</p>
<p>And because of that, even if you wanted to try</p>
<p>to recreate this being from 50, 75 years ago,</p>
<p>you know, that if you could take the DNA</p>
<p>and bring them back to life, you couldn&rsquo;t recreate this person</p>
<p>because we wouldn&rsquo;t have anybody to impart the skills to them</p>
<p>that they learned in their formative years.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the other thing that modern technology</p>
<p>brings to the table, steroids.</p>
<p>You know, artificial chemical enhancements</p>
<p>that someone today might employ.</p>
<p>And there was some interesting material</p>
<p>that was in Silver&rsquo;s book about this, too,</p>
<p>where he talked about some boxers who may or may not,</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t generally advertise this stuff,</p>
<p>have tried to take the shortcut of something like steroids</p>
<p>to help them in the ring, only to find out</p>
<p>that it looks like, that&rsquo;s the best way to phrase this,</p>
<p>there are no studies, but it looks like what happens</p>
<p>to boxers who use steroids is they run out of gas.</p>
<p>And some of these boxers that were rumored to be on the stuff</p>
<p>ran out of gas, famously, in some of these fights.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s an interesting aspect, too.</p>
<p>So, you say, well, these days, they&rsquo;d be using</p>
<p>human girth hormone, still might not let you beat</p>
<p>Tony Zale back in the day.</p>
<p>Or Sugar Ray Robinson. I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re gonna do</p>
<p>to beat Sugar Ray Robinson.</p>
<p>And that whole question of the hot hand skill,</p>
<p>like, what do you need to play hot hands?</p>
<p>Um, if you&rsquo;re just born, like, good at that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just born good at it. Muhammad Ali had one</p>
<p>of the fastest jabs you ever saw.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t fix that with weights, right?</p>
<p>Push-ups and chin-ups aren&rsquo;t gonna make that faster.</p>
<p>And Sugar Ray Robinson had the same thing.</p>
<p>That sort of punch speed, or punch power.</p>
<p>Silver has a line in his book where he goes over</p>
<p>all these great old punchers, people that were</p>
<p>absolute murderers. Um, and then says none of them</p>
<p>ever touched a weight. He writes, quote,</p>
<p>Old school trainers understood that pumping up the size</p>
<p>of arm, back, leg, and shoulder muscles</p>
<p>with an aggressive weight training program</p>
<p>did not correlate to an increase in power.</p>
<p>Punching power, he writes, is a function of balance,</p>
<p>leverage, coordination, speed, and timing.</p>
<p>A boxer has to be able to snap his punches.</p>
<p>The most effective punchers in the history of the sport,</p>
<p>Joe Lewis, Jack Dempsey, Rocky Marciano,</p>
<p>Sonny Liston, Jimmy Wilde, Bob Fitzsimmons,</p>
<p>Stanley Ketchel, Sugar Ray Robinson,</p>
<p>Sandy Sadler, Archie Moore, Henry Armstrong,</p>
<p>Bob Foster, Alexis Arguello, Roberto Duran,</p>
<p>never included weight training in their daily workout routines.</p>
<p>None of these super punchers had the type of unnatural</p>
<p>bulging muscularity one often sees among today&rsquo;s boxers.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>Boxing, the key is to develop speed.</p>
<p>And most fighters, when they go into it,</p>
<p>they have enough strength through their regular training.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need weightlifting.</p>
<p>The old-time trainers disdained weightlifting.</p>
<p>It was damaging to the fighter.</p>
<p>It slowed them up.</p>
<p>And just to give you an example,</p>
<p>if I can quote from my book here</p>
<p>about athletes today being bigger, stronger, faster,</p>
<p>why doesn&rsquo;t that apply to boxing?</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t all athletes better today?</p>
<p>Boxing is on a different level.</p>
<p>On a superficial level, the newer is always better</p>
<p>attitude towards athletic excellence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quoting here from my book, appears to be valid,</p>
<p>except for one important caveat.</p>
<p>A boxer&rsquo;s performance, unlike that of a swimmer,</p>
<p>track and field athlete, or weightlifter,</p>
<p>cannot be defined in terms of finite measurement.</p>
<p>Boxing&rsquo;s interaction of athleticism, experience,</p>
<p>technique, and psychology is a far more complex activity</p>
<p>than just running, jumping, lifting, or throwing.</p>
<p>And to blithely state that today&rsquo;s top professional boxers</p>
<p>are better than their predecessors</p>
<p>simply because measurable athletic performance has</p>
<p>improved in other sports whose winners are determined</p>
<p>by a stopwatch, ruler, or scale is analogous to suggesting</p>
<p>a singer is great only because he</p>
<p>is capable of reaching a higher note than anyone else.</p>
<p>Of course, no reasonable person would</p>
<p>agree with that statement because it totally</p>
<p>ignores the complex nuances of the singer&rsquo;s craft,</p>
<p>such as timbre, inflection, vocal range, and phrasing.</p>
<p>Yet many people, without even realizing it,</p>
<p>apply the same logic to boxing, oblivious</p>
<p>as they are to the complex nuances of the boxer&rsquo;s craft.</p>
<p>See, when you have people, a lack of quality teachers,</p>
<p>people who don&rsquo;t really know what to do,</p>
<p>they begin to grasp at certain ideas</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t really understand.</p>
<p>So crazy as it sounds, the Rocky films</p>
<p>influenced these younger trainers who said, hey,</p>
<p>football players are using weight training.</p>
<p>You know, why shouldn&rsquo;t boxers?</p>
<p>They need to get stronger.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t understand that with weight training,</p>
<p>the boxers begin to throw their punches in a wider arc.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t get them off fast enough.</p>
<p>But the old-time trainers who lived this sport day in</p>
<p>and day out, their whole lives, they understood</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t to be done.</p>
<p>Nobody trained better than Rocky Marciano, okay?</p>
<p>Or Joe Lewis.</p>
<p>As Joe Frazier, I quote Joe Frazier in my book,</p>
<p>he said, if it was good enough for them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good enough for me.</p>
<p>And he trained in the old-school way.</p>
<p>So modern methods don&rsquo;t necessarily mean better.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s certainly the case in boxing,</p>
<p>which has devolved, not evolved.</p>
<p>What that Joe Frazier quote by Silver points out, though,</p>
<p>is that when it comes to something like</p>
<p>physical conditioning, that&rsquo;s all recoverable</p>
<p>or preservable stuff, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s information that someone can write down,</p>
<p>and you could open the gym tomorrow like Frazier did</p>
<p>and say, we&rsquo;re only going to build you up</p>
<p>the old-fashioned way and have enough information to do it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not lost information.</p>
<p>It might be considered outdated by some, but it&rsquo;s known.</p>
<p>What is truly lost, though, is the stuff that would have made</p>
<p>the boxers of the past so much better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the technique, right? It&rsquo;s the little things.</p>
<p>And this is in Silver&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>and he has several different quotes.</p>
<p>I mean, for example, he quotes one of his experts</p>
<p>in the book is Mike Capriano, Jr.,</p>
<p>who was the son of one of these great trainers,</p>
<p>the guy who trained Jake LaMotta, the Raging Bull,</p>
<p>in addition to a lot of other people.</p>
<p>And then Jr. followed in his father&rsquo;s footsteps,</p>
<p>becoming an amateur fighter, trainer, manager.</p>
<p>He was the head coach for the Camp Lejeune</p>
<p>Marine Corps boxing team.</p>
<p>And he says about the little techniques,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s not talk in generalities.</p>
<p>What do we mean when we say little techniques?</p>
<p>And Capriano, Jr. says, quote,</p>
<p>There are no super skilled boxers like Tippi Larkin,</p>
<p>Billy Graham, or Maxie Shapiro.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see them around.</p>
<p>There were many different types of fighters,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d see many different styles,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s probably what made them better fighters.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see anyone with that type of skill today</p>
<p>in any weight division.</p>
<p>Some of today&rsquo;s fighters look good,</p>
<p>and they seem to have the natural instincts,</p>
<p>and maybe somebody is teaching them,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t see the moves.</p>
<p>They need more seasoning.</p>
<p>He continues, quote,</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see a fighter bend and weave in anymore.</p>
<p>I mean, we might see somebody bob back and forth</p>
<p>and move in, but that&rsquo;s not your classic</p>
<p>bend and weave move.</p>
<p>Even Tyson never did that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d bob back and forth, but he just distracted you,</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;d throw one of those overhand punches.</p>
<p>Tyson bullied his way in.</p>
<p>He bobbed, but he didn&rsquo;t weave.</p>
<p>He tried to overpower you,</p>
<p>and then when he couldn&rsquo;t overpower you,</p>
<p>he got stymied.</p>
<p>Tyson really had no moves.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see fighters today sliding in, he says.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see the feints, the hook-off a feint,</p>
<p>step to the right and uppercut,</p>
<p>moving, grabbing the elbow and spinning the fighter.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see any of that today because it&rsquo;s gone,</p>
<p>and nobody knows how to teach it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see any of these fighters making the same moves</p>
<p>as the old-time fighters, absolutely not.</p>
<p>The fans today never saw these fighters.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>He then says that craftiness is missing.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s ring craftiness.</p>
<p>He says, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Craftiness&rsquo; is missing.</p>
<p>Moore,&rdquo; meaning Archie Moore,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Moore was crafty. Dempsey was crafty.</p>
<p>Roberto Duran had great instincts and was crafty.</p>
<p>Not feinting, no body punches, and no craftiness.</p>
<p>These are the hallmarks of today&rsquo;s top fighters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>Now, this all kind of sounds like sour grapes when you hear it,</p>
<p>but these guys all know it sounds like sour grapes,</p>
<p>and so they continually say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just some old man saying they were better in my day.</p>
<p>Ask anybody.</p>
<p>Well, one of the people, and again,</p>
<p>this is one of the things I really like about the book,</p>
<p>these experts, in air quotes,</p>
<p>come from a wide variety of backgrounds,</p>
<p>but they usually box themselves at one time or another.</p>
<p>But one of these guys in the book, Ted Linsky,</p>
<p>is a PhD neuroscientist who also used to box.</p>
<p>And he has an interesting way of addressing the questions</p>
<p>that I often come up with in my own mind,</p>
<p>which is, I&rsquo;m kind of a humanitarian kind of nice guy,</p>
<p>so why would I like a sport with so much,</p>
<p>you know, human demolition?</p>
<p>And his point is,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not what the sport&rsquo;s supposed to be.</p>
<p>And the fact that it is human demolition now</p>
<p>is a perfect example that shows you right to your face.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not what it used to be.</p>
<p>And Linsky, the neuroscientist, says, quote,</p>
<p>If today&rsquo;s fans were shown some full-length films</p>
<p>of Sugar Ray Robinson,</p>
<p>they would think that it&rsquo;s something different and unusual,</p>
<p>but they wouldn&rsquo;t understand what he was doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different language.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always been fighting, he says,</p>
<p>but boxing was something different.</p>
<p>I very rarely watch fights anymore these days.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t watch an entire fight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of depressing to watch.</p>
<p>But if this was what boxing was when I was a kid,</p>
<p>I would be embarrassed for having spent so much time watching it,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s nothing but brutality.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no beauty in this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fighting, nothing else.</p>
<p>There used to be skill and grace</p>
<p>in conjunction with the brutality.</p>
<p>Even sluggers were smart.</p>
<p>Take a look at Reuben Hurricane Carter.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t take a punch to land a punch.</p>
<p>You know, he says,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had discussions about people</p>
<p>being actually knowledgeable about boxing.</p>
<p>If you watch fights nowadays as a fan,</p>
<p>if you can sit through an entire fight,</p>
<p>then you don&rsquo;t know boxing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if you know statistics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if you could give me the history back to the Romans.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t understand boxing itself.</p>
<p>If you can sit and watch this thing,</p>
<p>what boxing has become, and what fighting is,</p>
<p>then you don&rsquo;t like boxing.</p>
<p>You like fighting.</p>
<p>You like brawling.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not the same thing.</p>
<p>If you compare what boxing once was,</p>
<p>and what it has become,</p>
<p>this is checkers in comparison to chess.&quot;</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>But in the same way that</p>
<p>the training of these boxers</p>
<p>is a lost art, right?</p>
<p>The institutional memory is gone.</p>
<p>You can actually say the same thing</p>
<p>about the people who watch the sport,</p>
<p>as was implied in the quote we just read.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s boxing fan not only wouldn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what they were looking at,</p>
<p>they might not like it when they saw it.</p>
<p>And I asked Mike Silver about that too.</p>
<p>‚ô™</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if they would like what they saw,</p>
<p>if they saw a good match, because you had mentioned,</p>
<p>you used a phrase that I like and I&rsquo;m gonna steal,</p>
<p>a human demolition derby,</p>
<p>when you were talking about some of these brawls</p>
<p>where it might be a bloodlust enjoyment kind of thing,</p>
<p>but you mentioned yourself,</p>
<p>and I believe you quote somebody else saying,</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t want to watch that.</p>
<p>That you might think that race car fans</p>
<p>are watching for the crack-ups,</p>
<p>but boxing fans who in the old days were watching for,</p>
<p>can a guy hit and not be hit back?</p>
<p>Is he defensively skilled? Can he move well?</p>
<p>These days, if you saw a fight like that,</p>
<p>modern fight fans who grew up in the post-Tyson era</p>
<p>might think that that&rsquo;s a boring fight,</p>
<p>that what you want are two guys with no defense.</p>
<p>Would a modern fight fan enjoy a well-fought fight</p>
<p>from the 1940s?</p>
<p>No, no, very few would.</p>
<p>In fact, if they watched Willie Pepp in the fight,</p>
<p>they might not know what he&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>To them, being used to Slugfest</p>
<p>and the Arturo Gatti type fighter,</p>
<p>not to diminish him, he had great heart,</p>
<p>but the skill level was basically that of a tough guy</p>
<p>that just tried to out-punch his opponent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure they would recognize</p>
<p>what Willie Pepp was doing in the ring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the younger fans, and again,</p>
<p>a lot of it has to do with the fact</p>
<p>that mixed martial arts is gaining in popularity,</p>
<p>that the fight fans today want to see knockouts.</p>
<p>And home runs in baseball,</p>
<p>and I mean, you can take it across the board.</p>
<p>You got it, and power serves, and, you know,</p>
<p>tennis, and they just want to see the power.</p>
<p>They want to see the knockouts.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s exciting to them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not interested in seeing a guy flitting,</p>
<p>you know, moving in and out, jabbing, not getting hit.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a shame because boxing is an art,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a brutal sport.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not diminishing the danger of it at all.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m writing a current book</p>
<p>that deals with the danger of boxing</p>
<p>and how to mitigate those dangers</p>
<p>under the current circumstances.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s certain things that can be done.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the sport will allow it or do it,</p>
<p>but, um, no, your premise is correct.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s not what they want to see.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sad because it just means more damage.</p>
<p>In addition, and this applies to all sports,</p>
<p>but more so in boxing,</p>
<p>the intangibles are such a huge part of things, right?</p>
<p>Maybe not more than the measurables.</p>
<p>It depends on the sport, right?</p>
<p>You can say that the five-foot, nine-inch kid</p>
<p>who wants to be an NBA center</p>
<p>has everything you want but the height,</p>
<p>but that might not be enough.</p>
<p>But you might say the reverse</p>
<p>about the seven-foot, five-inch tall person too, right?</p>
<p>That he&rsquo;s got all the measurables,</p>
<p>but none of the intangibles.</p>
<p>In boxing, the intangibles are, well,</p>
<p>more important than in any other sport you can think of</p>
<p>because one of the intangibles</p>
<p>is somebody is hurting you&hellip; physically.</p>
<p>And what that means is the kind of people</p>
<p>who can be good athletes in boxing</p>
<p>have to have something that most other sports don&rsquo;t require.</p>
<p>You have to be able to take physical punishment, damage,</p>
<p>and somebody attacking you&hellip;</p>
<p>and still perform at a high athletic level.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s both mental and physical toughness involved.</p>
<p>And part of the reason why this earlier era</p>
<p>may actually have an advantage&hellip;</p>
<p>is the unquantifiable question,</p>
<p>something we talk in the history shows about a lot,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s clearly there,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t measure it or quantify it,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the question of toughness.</p>
<p>I was intrigued by one of the points made in the book,</p>
<p>that the reason defense was so much better back in the day</p>
<p>is not just because it&rsquo;s something you want to have</p>
<p>and nobody wants to get hit,</p>
<p>but because these people fought so often</p>
<p>and needed the money so badly, right?</p>
<p>You could just make enough for rent with a fight, maybe,</p>
<p>in some of these eras, that you had to be able to fight</p>
<p>in three weeks or a month to pay your next rent,</p>
<p>so you couldn&rsquo;t be too beat up in this fight.</p>
<p>Same thing with the trainers.</p>
<p>They had to make sure their boxer could box</p>
<p>because they needed to eat.</p>
<p>So there were all these economic incentives</p>
<p>to perform a certain way athletically.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>The mental toughness part, though,</p>
<p>is unlike, you know, anything else I&rsquo;ve run into</p>
<p>in any other sport.</p>
<p>And think about, I remember when I was watching a film on,</p>
<p>it was NFL Films film, about the sort of football players</p>
<p>that they had in the 1950s.</p>
<p>And they made a big deal to point out</p>
<p>that so many of these people had actually been</p>
<p>in the Second World War and seen combat.</p>
<p>And that after combat, the sport of football</p>
<p>had a sort of a different feel to it</p>
<p>than when they were college players</p>
<p>and young, wide-eyed kids.</p>
<p>Well, you could make the same case about all these fighters.</p>
<p>I mean, the greatest eras in boxing</p>
<p>are after both World Wars.</p>
<p>If these people weren&rsquo;t combat veterans themselves,</p>
<p>they came from a society that produced those kinds of people,</p>
<p>and then a depression.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two quotes from this book that stood out to me.</p>
<p>The first one was by one of Muhammad Ali&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Olympic teammates in the 1960 Rome Olympics</p>
<p>that fought for the United States,</p>
<p>Wilbur Skeeter McClure.</p>
<p>And I like his because he lays out the entire premise</p>
<p>of this conversation we&rsquo;re having.</p>
<p>The idea that in every other sport you can think of,</p>
<p>the athletes have gotten better, except this one.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s quoted by Mike Silver in the book as saying, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Boxing, in my opinion, is the only sport</p>
<p>in which the participants haven&rsquo;t gotten better</p>
<p>since the 1930s, 40s, and 50s.</p>
<p>Football players today are better than the ones</p>
<p>who were playing in the 50s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same with basketball and baseball.</p>
<p>The fighters of today couldn&rsquo;t even hold a candle</p>
<p>to the fighters of the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p>They just couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>They were too tough and too strong</p>
<p>and too savvy and too skilled.</p>
<p>Part of the reason is owing to the fact</p>
<p>that they fought more frequently.</p>
<p>You have champions today who fight once or twice a year.</p>
<p>Anybody who applies his craft to any trade or profession</p>
<p>and performs it only twice a year can&rsquo;t be good.</p>
<p>You just cannot develop that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>The other quote, and I read this one to Mr. Silver</p>
<p>and got his reaction in the next sound clip,</p>
<p>was from boxing trainer Teddy Atlas,</p>
<p>who, by the way, once upon a time,</p>
<p>started with a very young Mike Tyson, right?</p>
<p>And Teddy Atlas is trying to address this preoccupation</p>
<p>that we all have, and we&rsquo;re trained to have, right?</p>
<p>We live in the era of measurables.</p>
<p>How high did that guy jump? What&rsquo;s his height?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s his weight? What&rsquo;s his 40 time?</p>
<p>And Teddy Atlas is basically saying,</p>
<p>forget about that.</p>
<p>You have people here who are mental monsters</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going up against in the sport,</p>
<p>where that&rsquo;s a key&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s your key measurable, right?</p>
<p>Are you a mental monster?</p>
<p>And how much of a mental monster are you?</p>
<p>And Atlas says, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So my question to the guys of today&rsquo;s era</p>
<p>that say that size is too much</p>
<p>is where are these big heavyweights</p>
<p>ever gonna find a way to deal with that experience?</p>
<p>Where are they ever gonna find a way to deal with that size?</p>
<p>Where are they ever gonna find a way to deal</p>
<p>with that mental toughness?</p>
<p>Because today&rsquo;s fighters are depleted of these qualities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now italicized, depleted of it.</p>
<p>The old timers had all of those qualities</p>
<p>in that earlier era.</p>
<p>They had the experience,</p>
<p>and they knew how to deal with these things.</p>
<p>So my question would be, who&rsquo;s in danger here?</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>He means the very big super heavyweights of today,</p>
<p>or the relatively small heavyweights</p>
<p>of the earlier era,</p>
<p>or the relatively small heavyweights of the earlier era.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;d mentioned, though,</p>
<p>that heavyweight&rsquo;s a little bit different,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the only weight class</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s no maximum.</p>
<p>In the other weight class, a 140-pound fighter in 1940</p>
<p>would still be fighting a 140-pound fighter today.</p>
<p>So that might even make things like mental toughness</p>
<p>and all that an even, you know, larger determinant</p>
<p>of how things turned out.</p>
<p>But Atlas continues about this size question</p>
<p>in the super heavyweight division. Quote,</p>
<p>Before you talk to me about the 240-pounder</p>
<p>versus the 190 or 205-pounder,</p>
<p>my first question would be,</p>
<p>before we could even sanction this match,</p>
<p>to explain it to me,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think it would be fair</p>
<p>to the bigger fighter.</p>
<p>Explain to me how this 240-pound brat,</p>
<p>this spoiled brat,</p>
<p>is going to deal with this monster,</p>
<p>he means from the past,</p>
<p>who has 160 fights,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s fought every good fighter in the world</p>
<p>since he&rsquo;s been fighting,</p>
<p>who knows every trick in the book,</p>
<p>and who&rsquo;s as mentally tough as a piece of steel.</p>
<p>Explain that to me.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>Mike Silver had a few thoughts about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so true. So true.</p>
<p>Teddy hit it right on the nail on the head with that.</p>
<p>Um, the fighters were not only&hellip;</p>
<p>Again, this is an aspect that&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>than other sports. You could be</p>
<p>a legendary, great basketball player, okay?</p>
<p>Um, and yet,</p>
<p>not have what we would call in boxing,</p>
<p>a heart, you know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sport that requires great skill.</p>
<p>But, you know, what a boxer&rsquo;s trying to do athletically,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s also getting hit in the face while he&rsquo;s doing it.</p>
<p>Or he&rsquo;s getting a terrific punch</p>
<p>to the solar plexus or to the liver.</p>
<p>Um, he has to accept that type of pain</p>
<p>and keep going.</p>
<p>And it takes&hellip; That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve always admired boxers.</p>
<p>It takes a certain type of individual</p>
<p>to have that within them</p>
<p>and to be successful in this sport.</p>
<p>It is the toughest sport in the world, bar none.</p>
<p>And the fighters,</p>
<p>if you can go into the technique, the greater technique,</p>
<p>the more experience.</p>
<p>But, as you mentioned the phrase,</p>
<p>greatest generation,</p>
<p>they also had the mental toughness.</p>
<p>And that is a huge part of boxing.</p>
<p>And to go through the type of monsters</p>
<p>they had to go through to become&hellip;</p>
<p>Not champion, just to become a contender.</p>
<p>The depth of competition was so severe</p>
<p>that when you made it,</p>
<p>you know you had an accomplished fighter there.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t have a guy coming out of the amateurs</p>
<p>fighting 12 fights and winning a title.</p>
<p>No, you had to go through 40, 50, 60, 70 fights minimum.</p>
<p>Experience all type of styles.</p>
<p>And he had to display the heart.</p>
<p>Or in bare knuckle days, they used to call it bottom.</p>
<p>So I love that phrase, the head bottom.</p>
<p>So, these are aspects that must be taken into account</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re judging a great fighter.</p>
<p>And I think, to give a modern day example,</p>
<p>Mike Tyson had all the physical assets</p>
<p>of any great fighter that ever lived.</p>
<p>I mean, he was just, you know, just a&hellip;</p>
<p>a solid physical specimen</p>
<p>that was just really impressive.</p>
<p>Tremendous puncher, could take a great punch.</p>
<p>But in the words of Customato, Teddy Atlas&rsquo; mentor,</p>
<p>he really lacked the character.</p>
<p>When the going got tough, he bit an ear, okay?</p>
<p>Looking for a way out.</p>
<p>So, having the great physical skills,</p>
<p>which might get you by,</p>
<p>which will get you by in another sport,</p>
<p>it will keep you from attaining greatness as a boxer.</p>
<p>I mean true greatness, not what they call in greatness today.</p>
<p>There are very few, very few great boxers</p>
<p>over the past 25, 30 years. A few.</p>
<p>However, in the days when the competition</p>
<p>was much more severe, you can&hellip;</p>
<p>Those fighters were genuinely great.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re talking about, we know who they are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that we do, though.</p>
<p>And this gets back to my earlier question</p>
<p>about if we saw true boxing greatness,</p>
<p>would a modern audience even recognize it?</p>
<p>I mean, go to some of the boxing discussion boards</p>
<p>out there, and the fighting message boards,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll read a lot of people who will think</p>
<p>that Mike Tyson would beat anybody ever.</p>
<p>Now, I say this as a person that really enjoyed</p>
<p>Mike Tyson fights, and he was quite a breath of fresh air</p>
<p>when he first showed up. We&rsquo;d had a lot of years</p>
<p>of fights without spectacular knockouts,</p>
<p>at least at the highest levels of the heavyweight division.</p>
<p>And so, he was a very sort of a different vibe.</p>
<p>And like Ali, there was a lot to the guy</p>
<p>that made him compelling, either for good or bad reasons.</p>
<p>You wanted to root for him or against him.</p>
<p>And his fights, once again, sort of reawakened</p>
<p>a wider interest in boxing than just amongst</p>
<p>the so-called boxing fans. But here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Eddie Futch, who was one of the last</p>
<p>of the great golden age trainers.</p>
<p>I have a bunch of books about boxing trainers.</p>
<p>And Eddie Futch is like one of the last of the people,</p>
<p>you know, in some of the chapters of these books,</p>
<p>right? Sort of the last of an era.</p>
<p>And Futch is one of these guys who boxed himself</p>
<p>as a lighter weight guy in the era of Joe Louis.</p>
<p>And he sparred with Joe Louis, and they were friends.</p>
<p>So he remembers that era. But then he stayed</p>
<p>as this great trainer, you know, for many,</p>
<p>many years afterwards. He was training</p>
<p>heavyweight champions, you know, long after</p>
<p>Mike Tyson was on the scene. He trained</p>
<p>Riddick Bowe, for example. And Mark Cramm,</p>
<p>who was one of the great boxing writers,</p>
<p>when he was writing for Esquire magazine,</p>
<p>cornered Futch and asked him, basically,</p>
<p>was Mike Tyson one of the best five heavyweights</p>
<p>of all time? So we&rsquo;re not talking about,</p>
<p>you know, any weight class. We&rsquo;re just saying,</p>
<p>you know, top five heavyweights.</p>
<p>And this, again, from a man who boxed them,</p>
<p>coached them, all the way into the modern era,</p>
<p>knew Tyson&rsquo;s style very well. And he said, quote&hellip;</p>
<p>No. Joe Louis had too much in either hand for Mike.</p>
<p>Short, deadly combinations that shake you to your shoes.</p>
<p>With Muhammad Ali, Mike wouldn&rsquo;t hit him</p>
<p>with a hand grenade. Jersey Joe Walcott</p>
<p>would have been too smart for him.</p>
<p>Sonny Liston was too big and powerful,</p>
<p>and had a jarring jab. Rocky Marciano would be hit,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for sure. But Mike would see violence</p>
<p>in spades. End of quote.</p>
<p>Well, let me add that I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d be able to handle George Foreman either.</p>
<p>So&hellip; I&rsquo;m not sure we&rsquo;re in a position</p>
<p>in this day and age, because for the same reason</p>
<p>that these boxers can&rsquo;t fight like the boxers of the past,</p>
<p>because of the lost knowledge, we can&rsquo;t judge a fight</p>
<p>like fight fans of the past, for the exact same reason.</p>
<p>This is obviously a discussion like sports top ten lists are,</p>
<p>that is designed to provoke conversation,</p>
<p>maybe even a friendly argument over appetizers,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s sort of what makes this wonderful.</p>
<p>As I said at the very beginning of this show,</p>
<p>this is the kind of subject sports fans</p>
<p>have enjoyed talking about forever.</p>
<p>You could get Russ Francis to preempt the topic</p>
<p>on his show, if you could get him, you know,</p>
<p>engrossed in a conversation like this.</p>
<p>The one thing I will suggest, though,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s not a great conversation to have</p>
<p>until you&rsquo;ve read Silver&rsquo;s book.</p>
<p>And I asked him what the reaction was</p>
<p>amongst the fight fan audience,</p>
<p>and he says it was a generational reaction.</p>
<p>Older fans agreed with him, younger fans were almost</p>
<p>insulted that the modern fighters that they liked</p>
<p>are being denigrated.</p>
<p>But he said they also tended to be people</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t read the book, that they came to that conclusion</p>
<p>by simply, you know, thinking bigger, stronger, faster.</p>
<p>Of course, they&rsquo;re better today.</p>
<p>So I would suggest reading the book,</p>
<p>but then I&rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts</p>
<p>on Twitter at Hardcore History.</p>
<p>And we can talk about this a little bit,</p>
<p>because to me, this is one of the most fascinating</p>
<p>sports-related topics out there,</p>
<p>and I think boxing is the only one</p>
<p>where you could really make the counterintuitive argument</p>
<p>that in this one case, maybe it&rsquo;s the exception</p>
<p>that proves the rule, right?</p>
<p>Did I use that phrase properly? I think I did.</p>
<p>If you like the arc of boxing, though,</p>
<p>you might be interested in some of Mike Silver&rsquo;s other books.</p>
<p>And you can go to his website, by the way,</p>
<p>at MikeSilverBoxing.com if you want to see any of this.</p>
<p>But he wrote The Night the Referee Hit Back,</p>
<p>Memorable Moments from the World of Boxing.</p>
<p>He also wrote Stars in the Ring,</p>
<p>Jewish Champions in the Golden Age in Boxing.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s another ethnic group amongst the many,</p>
<p>many ethnic groups you forget has a permanent standing,</p>
<p>you know, claim to a chunk of boxing history.</p>
<p>You think of all, it&rsquo;s such an international sport,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it? I mean, you go from guys like Manny Pacquiao,</p>
<p>who is a hero in his home country in the Philippines,</p>
<p>a guy like Roberto Duran, who&rsquo;s a hero in, you know, Panama,</p>
<p>to the Eastern Bloc boxers who weren&rsquo;t really a part</p>
<p>of the pro years during the Cold War,</p>
<p>to boxers in Germany. I mean, which country?</p>
<p>Italian boxers are world-famous Irish boxers.</p>
<p>I mean, has there ever been a sport like that?</p>
<p>Let me add one more caveat that might suggest</p>
<p>that the best boxers who ever lived were from a long time ago.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the color barrier that existed for a while.</p>
<p>And Silver brings this up, too,</p>
<p>that affected African-American fighters.</p>
<p>Because, and this is an interesting socio-cultural aspect</p>
<p>of American sporting history also,</p>
<p>but boxing was one of the first areas</p>
<p>where African-Americans were able to dominate.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, you had the very early era,</p>
<p>the Great White Hope era, where a guy like Jack Johnson</p>
<p>can become heavyweight champion of the world</p>
<p>around the time of the First World War.</p>
<p>And then Joe Louis can become, I believe,</p>
<p>the first big African-American hero</p>
<p>to the whole country. These are huge things.</p>
<p>But some of the greatest boxers who ever lived,</p>
<p>maybe the greatest boxers who ever lived,</p>
<p>according to many people, never got a chance at the title.</p>
<p>Both for racial reasons, because there was a time</p>
<p>when some of these white boxers wouldn&rsquo;t fight black boxers,</p>
<p>but not just that, but because they were so good.</p>
<p>And in boxing, you can ditch people who are good.</p>
<p>Look at a guy like Charlie Burley or Holman Williams.</p>
<p>These are guys who, um&hellip;</p>
<p>some of the great boxers ducked.</p>
<p>Black boxers, too. Sugar Ray Robinson,</p>
<p>when somebody suggested he fight,</p>
<p>I think it was Charlie Burley and not Holman Williams,</p>
<p>he said, I thought you were my friend.</p>
<p>Right? Don&rsquo;t tell me to box that guy.</p>
<p>So, what ended up happening is, these boxers</p>
<p>that nobody would fight would often have to fight</p>
<p>each other over and over again.</p>
<p>You know, you wanna fight, well, Charlie Burley&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still available, because no one will fight him.</p>
<p>So, Williams and Burley would fight a bunch of times.</p>
<p>And you wanna talk about steel, sharpening steel?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very possible you bring one of those champions,</p>
<p>uncrowned champions, never allowed to fight</p>
<p>for the title champions, no one wanted a piece of them</p>
<p>champions back from 40, 50, 60, 70 years ago.</p>
<p>And no one would want a piece of them today, either.</p>
