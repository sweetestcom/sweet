<p>it should absolutely be a</p>
<p>sport or spitting in the gaping hole like a</p>
<p>basketball type</p>
<p>thing for accuracy yeah</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s hard to do</p>
<p>especially when you have a</p>
<p>chest cold because it</p>
<p>sticks to the everything</p>
<p>none of this</p>
<p>existed when i was a child</p>
<p>no it did just</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>people knew</p>
<p>about it do you</p>
<p>think it did do you</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of assholes</p>
<p>touching there</p>
<p>spitting in assholes</p>
<p>if we had flipcams back</p>
<p>in the 1800s you&rsquo;d see victorian gaping it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>worse victorian era</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>of it that&rsquo;s so bad like that guy that max hardcore guy</p>
<p>he went to jail for it</p>
<p>mean you gotta do something really fucking creepy</p>
<p>for them to be wanting to lock you up in jail in</p>
<p>2011 or 10 whether or</p>
<p>maybe it was even nine for porn</p>
<p>but this fucking guy man he was</p>
<p>opening girls assholes up</p>
<p>and with like</p>
<p>like speculums is that what it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>whatever medical instrument little</p>
<p>thing that you stretch it</p>
<p>apart with and then</p>
<p>peeing in there</p>
<p>and then making girls</p>
<p>drinking out with a</p>
<p>straw allegedly</p>
<p>the leaky basement</p>
<p>they were talking</p>
<p>about this sal</p>
<p>was talking</p>
<p>about this on the stern show</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s true but it is</p>
<p>true i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>doubt it i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>doubt it at</p>
<p>all i&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>a lot of shit</p>
<p>but see i was seeing shit back in the bulletin</p>
<p>board dial up days when i was like 9 10 years old</p>
<p>which explains a lot</p>
<p>oh right and</p>
<p>the russian soldier putting</p>
<p>his foot on a head and cutting a neck open and going</p>
<p>oh it would be</p>
<p>steamy because it was cold outside</p>
<p>like that analysis of fucked up shit at the</p>
<p>age of 9 or 10</p>
<p>so i believe it was all out there but what i don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>are how girls are making</p>
<p>money off of non porn</p>
<p>because guys are</p>
<p>sexually objectified by it like</p>
<p>the crushers that will</p>
<p>crush a cell</p>
<p>phone with a heel</p>
<p>or pump a gas</p>
<p>pedal on a car there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of fucked up there&rsquo;s out there they can get i mean</p>
<p>we do a what the fuck segment on our show</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>girls that get in pools wearing jean jackets</p>
<p>and they make like 30</p>
<p>a month off</p>
<p>subscriptions</p>
<p>cause some dude&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>oh look at that</p>
<p>dent i&rsquo;m getting wet</p>
<p>oh mommy would have</p>
<p>spanked me whoa</p>
<p>now i gotta clean my</p>
<p>flashlight or the minion have you ever seen the minion</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a website we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about this before</p>
<p>where this crazy ugly</p>
<p>nasty fat guy just fucks</p>
<p>these hot porn stars but who wants</p>
<p>i mean i can see</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>kinda cool i forgot</p>
<p>about this one but</p>
<p>like who wants to subscribe to that</p>
<p>guy well that was always the detramer of ron jeremy</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>anybody all the time i kind of</p>
<p>like it was</p>
<p>a girl the beginning was</p>
<p>sort of a normal looking guy but then he became hideous</p>
<p>took time but</p>
<p>clearly he&rsquo;s in the hideous realm i mean everyone goes</p>
<p>bad eventually</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s fucking hideous</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s part of the charm</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about the internet man and</p>
<p>technology in general that has</p>
<p>accelerated porn</p>
<p>to just and</p>
<p>accelerated depravity and just</p>
<p>decadence into just like really fucking intense levels</p>
<p>that have never</p>
<p>existed before i mean at</p>
<p>first it was seen as this bastion of hope that was</p>
<p>going to elevate</p>
<p>discussion and</p>
<p>bring intellectuals together and further</p>
<p>everything and it has done that to an extent</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really just created hardcore porn</p>
<p>like really hardcore porn i</p>
<p>think the thing is</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna change</p>
<p>young people</p>
<p>before good or bad and probably both</p>
<p>but i think once you&rsquo;re old</p>
<p>and you already have like a pattern set in your head</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way easier</p>
<p>to just jerk off to more and more fucked up shit</p>
<p>than it is to</p>
<p>look at the latest findings on</p>
<p>hypernovas or</p>
<p>look deep into</p>
<p>the real possibilities created by the</p>
<p>large hadron collider</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s too much man fuck that no pink ladder</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going exactly</p>
<p>i wanna watch some guy shit in some</p>
<p>chicks mouth</p>
<p>because i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know i mean there&rsquo;s guys that like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so angry at women they</p>
<p>wanna shit in</p>
<p>their mouth</p>
<p>like you fucking</p>
<p>bitch you fucking ugh</p>
<p>what could she have done</p>
<p>just exist exist</p>
<p>exist and be unattainable</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it is that&rsquo;s mom issues</p>
<p>right just dudes</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of weak bitches out there that&rsquo;s what it is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of dudes mom issues are not you</p>
<p>gotta fucking</p>
<p>look at the</p>
<p>whole world around you</p>
<p>make an assessment look</p>
<p>go on your instincts what is positive what is negative</p>
<p>what is admirable what makes you jealous</p>
<p>go towards that</p>
<p>and i always say</p>
<p>aspire to be the man</p>
<p>that you pretend to be when you&rsquo;re trying to get laid</p>
<p>okay aspire</p>
<p>to be that guy for real actually become that guy</p>
<p>you know just you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to use your mama&rsquo;s issues and all that stuff</p>
<p>get your shit together bitch</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i got an</p>
<p>m three because i want to be the guy that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t need a personality that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about i want to be the guy</p>
<p>are you moist yet plus</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the shit and there they handle awesome</p>
<p>i love cars man</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m so fascinated by the engineering that</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t possibly</p>
<p>be responsible for myself i look at something like a</p>
<p>m3 or something like that</p>
<p>thinking about all the fucking shit that&rsquo;s involved</p>
<p>with all the different</p>
<p>settings the</p>
<p>m setting and also the</p>
<p>suspension changes you feel it set a</p>
<p>macro for your car and all of a</p>
<p>sudden it&rsquo;s like the car is sucking</p>
<p>you by the asshole and just holding you to action</p>
<p>just the engineering</p>
<p>i believe that there&rsquo;s 30 german engineers</p>
<p>that shed a single tear whenever i put the top down</p>
<p>like i believe they&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>proud of their work and the time and</p>
<p>all the effort that went into making a</p>
<p>piece of plastic fold</p>
<p>i believe that they&rsquo;re crying</p>
<p>about it i love that that&rsquo;s not plastic wow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the coolest</p>
<p>things about the top of the</p>
<p>mt3 convertible</p>
<p>mm3 convertible rather</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all one</p>
<p>piece and metal that&rsquo;s like the coolest</p>
<p>thing and they figured out how to</p>
<p>do recently it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>transform it goes into like</p>
<p>three little</p>
<p>sections you have two sections in the window it&rsquo;s dope</p>
<p>watch when he does it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing like it&rsquo;s like an orchestration of</p>
<p>mechanical engineering you</p>
<p>hear the foam</p>
<p>you hear them</p>
<p>break easily isn&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>like oh you know</p>
<p>just more shit you know the more moving parts yeah</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s my life that&rsquo;s everybody&rsquo;s life now</p>
<p>right we get more shit so that it</p>
<p>could break so</p>
<p>that we can get pissed that it&rsquo;s shit and it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>how reliable</p>
<p>those things are</p>
<p>you know the most</p>
<p>unreliable car i ever had was a porsche i had a 911</p>
<p>turbo that broke down five times it was</p>
<p>ridiculous bmws i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never had a problem japanese cars i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never had a problem it&rsquo;s amazing how many</p>
<p>miles you can put on a car these days</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no problem</p>
<p>like back when you had like a</p>
<p>1970 barracuda</p>
<p>or something like that yo</p>
<p>hundred thousand</p>
<p>miles that thing&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>all right you get your</p>
<p>bearings are</p>
<p>blown and fucking</p>
<p>transmissions</p>
<p>gone some missing gears and the engine</p>
<p>smells like shit</p>
<p>i mean you have to rebuild</p>
<p>everything those</p>
<p>things just didn&rsquo;t last remember</p>
<p>those supras we had with the</p>
<p>lights that popped up and</p>
<p>mine did one of yours</p>
<p>break no i didn&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>one yeah i had the one with the</p>
<p>fixed i had a 92</p>
<p>or 93 toyota supra</p>
<p>when they went to that</p>
<p>space shape that was the</p>
<p>first really cool car that i got</p>
<p>that was my newsradio money</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something about</p>
<p>just the engineering of</p>
<p>these fucking cars</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s accelerated as well like</p>
<p>the m3 like the m</p>
<p>this m3 that i have is 420 horsepower</p>
<p>well the 911</p>
<p>turbo that i had was like</p>
<p>somewhere around the same like 420 horsepower</p>
<p>but it was all</p>
<p>turbo charged and it was</p>
<p>like all tweaked</p>
<p>down yeah and it&rsquo;s a different sort of a feeling</p>
<p>well this car is that with a full v8 with an 84 000 rpm</p>
<p>you know rev</p>
<p>limit i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking incredible is it eighty</p>
<p>four thousand eighty</p>
<p>eight thousand</p>
<p>four hundred</p>
<p>eight thousand</p>
<p>four hundred yeah</p>
<p>but when it hits</p>
<p>eight thousand</p>
<p>four hundred man that</p>
<p>whale it&rsquo;s like a formula one race car it</p>
<p>sounds awesome have you done launch control yet</p>
<p>no that sounds like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna kill the</p>
<p>transmission yeah</p>
<p>well if you warm your engine up you have to</p>
<p>drive for x amount of</p>
<p>miles at certain</p>
<p>speeds or whatnot you can drop it into</p>
<p>first shut off traction control</p>
<p>and if you hold</p>
<p>one of the shifter paddles in</p>
<p>or you put it in neutral</p>
<p>slam on the gas</p>
<p>while holding a</p>
<p>shifter paddle like</p>
<p>a checkered flag will appear</p>
<p>on the dash</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s launch control</p>
<p>yeah no there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>total easter eggs in the software</p>
<p>and then you can use</p>
<p>like your cruise control actual controls to</p>
<p>boost up the</p>
<p>rpm so when you let go</p>
<p>it engages that clutch</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re already at you know</p>
<p>7000 8000 rpm</p>
<p>screams and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>break your neck</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s badass</p>
<p>how&rsquo;d you find out</p>
<p>about that internet oh it&rsquo;s pretty common</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s common</p>
<p>the nissan actually did it for</p>
<p>their gtr and when people used it</p>
<p>it violated the warranty</p>
<p>what they say</p>
<p>the bmw if you do it over</p>
<p>twice apparently it</p>
<p>counts how many times you</p>
<p>do it it violates your warranty test wow that&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>make a better</p>
<p>thing don&rsquo;t give me something that</p>
<p>breaks stupid</p>
<p>the nissan one was</p>
<p>particularly</p>
<p>ridiculous because it&rsquo;s a goddamn race car</p>
<p>i mean what nissan was bragging about was</p>
<p>the 0 to 60 time was</p>
<p>ridiculously low</p>
<p>and the handling of the car is insane</p>
<p>fucking amazing car</p>
<p>i drove it but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about it it&rsquo;s like yeah it&rsquo;s really fast and yeah</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s ugly</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>goofy looking</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got some sort of a techno godzilla</p>
<p>thing going on that i&rsquo;m not really into</p>
<p>it stands out too much</p>
<p>but for all the</p>
<p>like if a ferrari stands out</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>stands out but it</p>
<p>stands out it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s beautiful</p>
<p>that car stands out like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on our</p>
<p>car stand out</p>
<p>cause they look like baby</p>
<p>sneakers on</p>
<p>wheels it&rsquo;s not a good stand out</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s an odd</p>
<p>stand out like i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t particularly i</p>
<p>tried to like it i looked around it and stared at it i</p>
<p>tried to like it but</p>
<p>the engineering though is</p>
<p>stunning what</p>
<p>about electric cars like the tesla</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not ready</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m interested in them eventually but i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>interested in something that you have to charge for 18</p>
<p>hours after you drive 250</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s stupid</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m interested</p>
<p>in the gallons though i get 15 gallons of gas per</p>
<p>you have a big</p>
<p>truck i know but that shit&rsquo;s</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s disgusting well it makes you mad when it</p>
<p>starts hitting 4 30 and</p>
<p>i mean what is it now 420 for regular</p>
<p>premiums like i</p>
<p>think 450 at chevron</p>
<p>by my point was</p>
<p>about the bmw is that</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>shocking is how much</p>
<p>better engineered they are just over a few years ago</p>
<p>compared to my supra</p>
<p>like the supra</p>
<p>was a really good handling car was like</p>
<p>but this m3 is like</p>
<p>glued to the fucking ground i</p>
<p>love it it&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>track first</p>
<p>nice car that i&rsquo;ve ever had in my life and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you turn the</p>
<p>wheel and the car just goes yeah it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t ask questions it&rsquo;s so connected to the road</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s so like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the word i mean precise</p>
<p>you know like the way it handles and moves and</p>
<p>the germans are</p>
<p>known for their precision and shit in</p>
<p>the mouth videos</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s up with that why the germans into</p>
<p>those scat videos</p>
<p>germans and japanese i don&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>point fingers now with the internet everybody&rsquo;s into</p>
<p>everything yeah yeah</p>
<p>mmm they just wanna</p>
<p>but wasn&rsquo;t at the root</p>
<p>i mean behind</p>
<p>every stereotype</p>
<p>well they just had an awesome word for it</p>
<p>is that what shaza</p>
<p>shaza shaza</p>
<p>point wow and who</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t like to yell that shaza</p>
<p>is shit that&rsquo;s what it is yeah shaza</p>
<p>is shit had a good word i don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>shaza itself is or if that&rsquo;s just an exclamation you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>make when you&rsquo;re actually crapping on someone but wow</p>
<p>yeah enough that they had to fucking</p>
<p>label it so</p>
<p>often like there&rsquo;s one porn when a guy shits in his</p>
<p>mouth oh no no no we have a</p>
<p>whole category of that yeah what</p>
<p>a guy shits on someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mouth and there&rsquo;s a category</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what people are into</p>
<p>well where else do you put it on the</p>
<p>shelf at the</p>
<p>adult video</p>
<p>store you know</p>
<p>yeah there is no more of those</p>
<p>they still exist do</p>
<p>they exist i</p>
<p>went to a sex shop the other day</p>
<p>just a lube run</p>
<p>stand up run to the mill</p>
<p>and feel like we</p>
<p>should be hearing</p>
<p>music why don&rsquo;t you just go to albertson people</p>
<p>were there do</p>
<p>special taste</p>
<p>no but this guy comes up to the</p>
<p>counter and he buys</p>
<p>like a card he&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>five dollars in</p>
<p>the booth and</p>
<p>a dude went and got a plastic card and they had a</p>
<p>whole adult</p>
<p>video arcade back there</p>
<p>and i saw at</p>
<p>least 10 different people come in in the</p>
<p>short time that i was there</p>
<p>to buy video cards to go in the back and beat off wow</p>
<p>and maybe there was something way cooler</p>
<p>maybe there was the</p>
<p>glory hole action or</p>
<p>maybe it was a unicorn ride</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening back there</p>
<p>like maybe there was some</p>
<p>crazy shit going on</p>
<p>my friend johnny</p>
<p>god rest his soul he used to go to new york</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s an addict and he used to</p>
<p>smoke crack</p>
<p>and go to those peep shows</p>
<p>that was his</p>
<p>thing when he would</p>
<p>smoke crack you</p>
<p>would want to go hide and</p>
<p>go to peep shows peep</p>
<p>shows hide in</p>
<p>those places all day and just</p>
<p>give the girl</p>
<p>money tell me</p>
<p>these horror stories</p>
<p>about what kind of</p>
<p>women are on the</p>
<p>other side like showing you</p>
<p>their asshole</p>
<p>do you think like girls</p>
<p>are like in</p>
<p>those glass</p>
<p>boxes like behind like you</p>
<p>know that hotel</p>
<p>where they have a girl in the</p>
<p>glass box behind the</p>
<p>checkout that&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>sunset have you ever seen that yes</p>
<p>i know what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about do you</p>
<p>think standard is the</p>
<p>standard do you</p>
<p>think like that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like the upgraded version of the peep show</p>
<p>girls like oh my god they like they</p>
<p>fight with each</p>
<p>other i work in the box of the</p>
<p>standard this weekend it&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>people that don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about when you go to the</p>
<p>standard as you go into the lobby</p>
<p>the standard</p>
<p>hotel in hollywood has the desk</p>
<p>where they check you in and</p>
<p>above the desk there&rsquo;s like a fish tank</p>
<p>like a big fish tank</p>
<p>with a woman in it</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s hot and she&rsquo;s in her</p>
<p>underwear and she&rsquo;s reading a book or she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>checking her</p>
<p>email and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird yeah and she&rsquo;s not supposed to interact with you</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t look at you and</p>
<p>smile and wave</p>
<p>cause that would be so anti la</p>
<p>right in la no</p>
<p>one pays attention to you it&rsquo;s not like she&rsquo;s there to</p>
<p>greet you like in</p>
<p>vegas if they were</p>
<p>gonna hire a hot</p>
<p>chick they&rsquo;d hire you</p>
<p>hello welcome to the casino</p>
<p>nice to meet you</p>
<p>do you need help with your bags yeah in la</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s in her</p>
<p>underwear reading her</p>
<p>email and you&rsquo;re like looking at her</p>
<p>i was with doug benson in</p>
<p>vegas and they had one of the same</p>
<p>things but the girls were so</p>
<p>excited to see doug benson they got out of character</p>
<p>and got out of the</p>
<p>glass box to take a</p>
<p>photo with him</p>
<p>awful duck benson</p>
<p>did that end with benson in the box</p>
<p>shaking it for people making out</p>
<p>with glassy</p>
<p>eyed bone neck</p>
<p>i love that dude i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>so jealous and envious of people that can perform well</p>
<p>stoned listen you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stoned right now stop</p>
<p>lying allegedly</p>
<p>stop lying on</p>
<p>those people allegedly</p>
<p>stop lying to america</p>
<p>you know you said something</p>
<p>in your twitter when you were</p>
<p>tweeting about coming here</p>
<p>that you were</p>
<p>worried about ruining your career</p>
<p>i thought that was hilarious not</p>
<p>worried i was</p>
<p>excited by the possibility</p>
<p>of ruining not my current like</p>
<p>i could get</p>
<p>pretty much caught doing whatever i need to on g4</p>
<p>right i mean the audience gets it you know they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>young dudes too</p>
<p>but if i&rsquo;m on the precipice</p>
<p>of either homelessness or</p>
<p>potentially</p>
<p>legitimizing myself and</p>
<p>this might be a nudge in one direction</p>
<p>you think so man i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a nudge towards the</p>
<p>right direction no i&rsquo;ve always said</p>
<p>i have always said</p>
<p>that if i can&rsquo;t say or do something that i want to do</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m in the wrong business yeah you know</p>
<p>or i&rsquo;m doing the wrong show</p>
<p>well you can</p>
<p>do you can back yourself</p>
<p>into a corner and not even realize it&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>you know you get</p>
<p>on a certain show and that certain show wants a certain</p>
<p>standard of behavior</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s a reason why charlie sheen is</p>
<p>bouncing back like this</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like a girl that&rsquo;s been molested</p>
<p>you know a girl that&rsquo;s been molested they bounce</p>
<p>back the other way</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>victim it&rsquo;s like when you do</p>
<p>something that you don&rsquo;t want to do</p>
<p>and you have to pretend to be some of them you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>when you get pushed in one way</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an elasticity to life</p>
<p>and it makes you bounce in the other way</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like you know like we were talking to dana</p>
<p>diamon and she was talking</p>
<p>about her family was like you know hey</p>
<p>smoke pot do whatever you want but don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>drink so i will fucking drink</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a you push someone</p>
<p>in one direction you to controlling one direction</p>
<p>they rebel you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not agree agree and</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>like i said if i can&rsquo;t say or do</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve absolutely lost</p>
<p>endorsement deals</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve lost all sorts of</p>
<p>stuff from i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna say that i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna do that and</p>
<p>well it may have cost me a</p>
<p>short term i</p>
<p>think long term it&rsquo;s the way to go so if we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about shizer porn and bmws</p>
<p>so be it cheers</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a matter of time before there is no more</p>
<p>sensors and</p>
<p>standards and all that nonsense like the internet is</p>
<p>pretty much kind of squashed</p>
<p>a good huge</p>
<p>chunk of that shit</p>
<p>i worry you</p>
<p>could put your content out</p>
<p>yeah i worry</p>
<p>about that ending at some</p>
<p>point yeah me too</p>
<p>especially as</p>
<p>the notion of iptv internet tv</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll get to the normal</p>
<p>thing probably at some point but</p>
<p>the notion that</p>
<p>that the distribution method</p>
<p>the way you&rsquo;re getting the content is</p>
<p>going to matter in five years it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>so when people turn on the tv and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching the internet</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be calls for</p>
<p>regulations and</p>
<p>clamp downs just the way there is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll still be able to</p>
<p>self distribute always</p>
<p>that avenue will be there to an extent well there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>regulation on</p>
<p>cable you know</p>
<p>cables not just</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>regulated by the expertise</p>
<p>yeah yeah but then</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t use advertisers i mean isn&rsquo;t that what</p>
<p>motivates it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be very difficult to rationalize imposing</p>
<p>some sort of standards</p>
<p>would have something really fucked up happening</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what you really have to</p>
<p>worry about and this is fucking</p>
<p>tin foil hat conspiracy theory</p>
<p>101 okay it</p>
<p>sounds absolutely</p>
<p>ridiculous but</p>
<p>if you were the government and you realize that hey</p>
<p>what have all these</p>
<p>rebellions all across the</p>
<p>world have in common</p>
<p>well they have in common</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>organized on the internet in a way that was</p>
<p>never possible before</p>
<p>okay how do we stop that from happening well</p>
<p>we have to figure out a way that the internet&rsquo;s evil</p>
<p>and so then</p>
<p>the internet gets used for something or blamed for</p>
<p>something and there&rsquo;s some sort of a terrorist attack</p>
<p>that was coordinated by the internet</p>
<p>okay there is a way around this and you can</p>
<p>still enjoy your internet but</p>
<p>now you have to log</p>
<p>in i mean there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been legislation proposed the internet kill</p>
<p>switch which people were talking</p>
<p>about like mad and it was actually</p>
<p>right before</p>
<p>egypt happened</p>
<p>right and then</p>
<p>they actually discussed it</p>
<p>right as egypt was happening</p>
<p>the main revolt</p>
<p>the notion that up it&rsquo;s for your</p>
<p>safety security there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>going on the</p>
<p>switch is now</p>
<p>flipped and there goes your internet</p>
<p>we have no idea how much of crises sees and political</p>
<p>overthrowing of governors</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>fucking warlords and</p>
<p>and and mayors and and</p>
<p>we have no idea how much of this shit is engineered</p>
<p>how much of foreign dictators</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>overthrown is engineered and engineered by the cia</p>
<p>general wesley clark</p>
<p>was talking</p>
<p>about this was a</p>
<p>video that i was</p>
<p>watching i put it on my twitter a couple of days ago</p>
<p>but he was talking in two thousand seven</p>
<p>okay in detail</p>
<p>about the plans that are in place</p>
<p>to overthrow</p>
<p>dictatorships throughout the</p>
<p>world including libya</p>
<p>gaddafi was here yeah</p>
<p>they were supporting gaddafi up</p>
<p>until that bitter end and then they said okay now we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna arm the</p>
<p>rebels yeah</p>
<p>so that they</p>
<p>could eventually</p>
<p>become al qaeda and hate us as well once they get into</p>
<p>power the whole</p>
<p>thing is completely</p>
<p>ridiculous but</p>
<p>our reputation</p>
<p>squandered it&rsquo;s gone</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t there a</p>
<p>point i remember being younger and being told</p>
<p>usa number one and believing that okay that&rsquo;s what the</p>
<p>world thought they all aspired but now</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>bunch of scared old men</p>
<p>a bunch of scared old men that want to keep</p>
<p>everybody down i mean that&rsquo;s what it seems like i mean</p>
<p>this whole country</p>
<p>seems like a</p>
<p>bunch of meddling fucks</p>
<p>you know and when it comes to the rest of the world</p>
<p>if i wasn&rsquo;t american and i didn&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>most of us here are</p>
<p>as much victims as the people around the</p>
<p>world that&rsquo;s just not happening to us physically</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just as</p>
<p>taken apart by this machine and pushed into a direction</p>
<p>outside of our control</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like we want this to happen</p>
<p>the disparity between rich and poor in this country</p>
<p>is far greater than the disparity of rich and poor</p>
<p>in many middle eastern</p>
<p>places well</p>
<p>yeah man listen</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>started on that</p>
<p>again i&rsquo;ll go on an inside job</p>
<p>you know rampage</p>
<p>about the financial institutions let&rsquo;s talk</p>
<p>about fucking into</p>
<p>socks let&rsquo;s talk</p>
<p>about anything let&rsquo;s talk</p>
<p>about google</p>
<p>tv i watched</p>
<p>inside job the</p>
<p>other day steven</p>
<p>have you seen it have you seen it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s mind nulling it&rsquo;s also brutal</p>
<p>but what we&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>financially is the same</p>
<p>thing we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>with other parts of the</p>
<p>world as far as</p>
<p>with resources and</p>
<p>invading countries and dominating things</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>things with</p>
<p>no regard whatsoever to the consequences and</p>
<p>no regard whatsoever</p>
<p>in how we&rsquo;re viewed</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>about this inside job</p>
<p>all these guys</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>problem walking with hundreds of millions of dollars</p>
<p>looking absolutely</p>
<p>ridiculous looking horrible</p>
<p>if they can get away with it they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do it and that&rsquo;s exactly the same shit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>with america and</p>
<p>these other parts of the</p>
<p>world what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in iraq</p>
<p>where no one is mentioning the fact that</p>
<p>literally a million people are</p>
<p>dead over there a fucking million people died in iraq</p>
<p>and we know for a fact there was no real</p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction</p>
<p>we know for a fact</p>
<p>i mean just the</p>
<p>fact that everybody&rsquo;s like yeah yeah yeah yeah whatever</p>
<p>keep going forward</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re not addressing that no</p>
<p>because joe we have to</p>
<p>focus on the important</p>
<p>things killing funding for</p>
<p>planned parenthood</p>
<p>and early education</p>
<p>because we have to do some serious cuts yeah we have to</p>
<p>we can only</p>
<p>drop so many billion dollar bombs isn&rsquo;t the government</p>
<p>shut down right now is there no</p>
<p>government to</p>
<p>is this a part of armageddon</p>
<p>is this just one more</p>
<p>thing like those</p>
<p>dolphins died</p>
<p>at all in 2012 i thought</p>
<p>like the mines just got lazy and they didn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>count anymore</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like fuck it alright much more</p>
<p>common kid than that it&rsquo;s way more</p>
<p>complicated</p>
<p>when i seen</p>
<p>the procession of the</p>
<p>equinox it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>based on the 26 000 year cycle</p>
<p>but you know it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s the end of the</p>
<p>world that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>crazy thing is</p>
<p>nowhere in the mayan</p>
<p>calendars does</p>
<p>it sends the end of a long count</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a new era that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean anything i mean</p>
<p>it could just mean that</p>
<p>you know generally</p>
<p>speaking humanity</p>
<p>develops in</p>
<p>cycles you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what the</p>
<p>hindus believe too the yugas</p>
<p>the whole idea of the yugas that there was</p>
<p>cycles of humanity and that we eventually</p>
<p>just by virtue of our design</p>
<p>we get to a</p>
<p>point of laziness and sloth once we have it all down</p>
<p>like we do today</p>
<p>and then eventually it</p>
<p>would spiral</p>
<p>out of control and then be the dark ages again</p>
<p>well either we&rsquo;re heading towards dark ages or like</p>
<p>transhumanism</p>
<p>one of the two yeah</p>
<p>or both right</p>
<p>fucking you hoarding</p>
<p>all the information inside some gigantic electric city</p>
<p>where everyone&rsquo;s in some hive mind</p>
<p>state just call this ion</p>
<p>barbarians outside the gate i mean</p>
<p>even if you connect to the hive mind i mean</p>
<p>if that does happen this</p>
<p>transhumanism actually does manifest itself</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>gonna have people</p>
<p>that are living in guam</p>
<p>right how are we</p>
<p>gonna get them and put</p>
<p>chips in them</p>
<p>no they&rsquo;re gonna be used to mine</p>
<p>the materials</p>
<p>necessary to make the</p>
<p>chips that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>they go some of them but in the</p>
<p>pacific islands you</p>
<p>gonna go and kidnap them we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna enslave them is it</p>
<p>gonna be some terminator shit</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be some people i</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still gonna be living old</p>
<p>school yeah</p>
<p>no matter what you do i met some of</p>
<p>those guys i met</p>
<p>a group of ex vietnam</p>
<p>vets in the emerald triangle</p>
<p>that are living in a box canyon</p>
<p>northern california</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s oh that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where baby counties</p>
<p>where they grow the weed dog</p>
<p>so what happened</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m up there and i&rsquo;m chatting with this guy bea</p>
<p>smith who&rsquo;s an ex vietnam</p>
<p>vet he was the</p>
<p>first guy busted by the feds after</p>

<p>only one road in one road out it takes like two hours</p>
<p>to drive it</p>
<p>and they all live</p>
<p>there in a community growing acres and acres of weed</p>
<p>and are they doing it</p>
<p>legit are they doing it like on the</p>
<p>sneak tip dude it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve interviewed so many people</p>
<p>about this and even the most</p>
<p>legit guys have some shady shit</p>
<p>going on it</p>
<p>still seems like</p>
<p>no matter what</p>
<p>loopholes they try to pretend they&rsquo;re exploiting</p>
<p>we take donations and we&rsquo;re a caregiver yeah</p>
<p>yeah dude you have some shady</p>
<p>shit in your past and you have two sets of books like</p>
<p>every other dispensary operator out there</p>
<p>so don&rsquo;t preach holy dude</p>

<p>cause here no</p>
<p>throwing these guys</p>
<p>under the bus</p>

<p>these dudes i love the</p>
<p>cause but i do not like people there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>wrong with wanting to get fucking</p>
<p>baked there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>wrong with weed</p>
<p>what is wrong are people that are co opting the</p>
<p>medicinal marijuana movement</p>
<p>and claiming that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>stoners that are trying to make money</p>
<p>or like getting loaded</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re pretending it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>their medicine</p>
<p>right and i&rsquo;m like you know there&rsquo;s no that&rsquo;s me</p>
<p>are you are you</p>
<p>claiming it&rsquo;s medicine</p>
<p>oh yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>medicine i need it</p>
<p>why can&rsquo;t you just like to</p>
<p>get high i do that too</p>
<p>i do that too but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about but i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>seeing all these</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re right i</p>
<p>agree with you i know what you&rsquo;re saying i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to these conventions and seeing</p>
<p>these guys that have like new like oh yeah</p>
<p>sativa benoit</p>
<p>balls now it&rsquo;s the coolest</p>
<p>medication you&rsquo;ll ever get it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you just found out a new way to get ripped or on high</p>
<p>for your asshole don&rsquo;t pretend whoa</p>
<p>that sativa benoit</p>
<p>balls is this something you just made up yeah</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m sure it is that would</p>
<p>be awesome if it was real</p>
<p>if the dot com is available let&rsquo;s go down</p>
<p>here this is belladonna&rsquo;s new</p>
<p>video right</p>
<p>sativa benoit</p>
<p>people find</p>
<p>a way to keister</p>
<p>everything from champagne to</p>
<p>ecstasy to i&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>video online of a</p>
<p>young lady i think</p>
<p>her youtube name is nero soup</p>
<p>and she took dmt up her ass yeah</p>
<p>dmt up your ass</p>
<p>absorbs directly</p>
<p>into the bloodstream</p>
<p>like dmt didn&rsquo;t get any harm i</p>
<p>wonder if you</p>
<p>could do that if you snorted</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>you know what i</p>
<p>think that the internet&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen like how the government&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get involved instead of the doing the kill</p>
<p>switch i almost</p>
<p>think that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do what</p>
<p>like web hosts have been doing lately which is</p>
<p>yeah that used to be the old days web hosts were like</p>
<p>unlimited bandwidth unlimited this blah blah blah 20</p>
<p>bucks a month</p>
<p>neutrality yeah yeah</p>
<p>and i think the government&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>gonna release hey we have internet too</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to sign up for this internet too</p>
<p>but if you want to it&rsquo;s like a thousand times faster</p>
<p>but the only</p>
<p>stipulation is</p>
<p>because now web hosts are doing the same</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s like hey</p>
<p>if you switch to</p>
<p>cloud based servers</p>
<p>you still get</p>
<p>everything else but now you have to pay for ram but</p>
<p>the way they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do that is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna turn the internet</p>
<p>you know now into that with net</p>
<p>neutrality or the lack thereof</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s gonna be you pay for the internet you get</p>
<p>premium superfast bandwidth access to the</p>
<p>stuff we want</p>
<p>you to have access to how important is the message</p>
<p>to people that we need to keep the internet free it has</p>
<p>most people&rsquo;s one of them is</p>
<p>gonna be one</p>
<p>of the most important debates of our time i</p>
<p>agree you know</p>
<p>and the fact</p>
<p>that they were trying like i thought google was</p>
<p>gonna be good on this</p>
<p>i really thought they were</p>
<p>gonna be the good guy in the fight</p>
<p>and the deal that they did with verizon and the fcc</p>
<p>is insane it</p>
<p>basically says listen</p>
<p>your traditional</p>
<p>broadband not</p>
<p>gonna fuck with it bro</p>
<p>net neutrality you guys are good</p>
<p>that wireless spectrum space</p>
<p>we can totally</p>
<p>clamp that down</p>
<p>well how many people believe wires are in our future</p>
<p>none it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>going high speed wireless and that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be delivered</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re pretending like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna totally</p>
<p>clamp down on that so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna pay</p>
<p>for your internet it&rsquo;ll probably be provided wirelessly</p>
<p>and then if you want</p>
<p>access to really good stuff</p>
<p>so at amp t</p>
<p>and paying more</p>
<p>at amp tm bing for life right well</p>
<p>my concern is censorship my concern isn&rsquo;t just over</p>
<p>control of bandwidth and</p>
<p>stuff like that my concern</p>
<p>control of bandwidth is it</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re right you know</p>
<p>you know yeah the ability to disseminate information as</p>
<p>quickly as possible is one of the most important parts</p>
<p>about it you know</p>
<p>i think that eventually</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have to figure out</p>
<p>how much control we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>allow the government to have over us because</p>
<p>people as a group</p>
<p>collectively</p>
<p>have to realize that there has never been</p>
<p>one thing in</p>
<p>human history</p>
<p>responsible</p>
<p>for more access to information than the internet</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s because of the free nature of it the free</p>
<p>you could put up a website</p>
<p>right now and</p>
<p>just put up the craziest fucking shit you want</p>
<p>and people will go to it and then it gets oh hey</p>
<p>check this out and</p>
<p>virally it spreads</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s never been anything like that ever in life</p>
<p>except rumors</p>
<p>rumors were the only</p>
<p>things that had</p>
<p>been spread</p>
<p>like it took years</p>
<p>to go from one</p>
<p>place to the</p>
<p>other now it&rsquo;s instantly</p>
<p>yeah like the richard gear</p>
<p>gerbil and the butt rumor</p>
<p>right that shit</p>
<p>spread over the</p>
<p>whole country</p>
<p>you know that</p>
<p>took it took a long ass time for that to happen</p>
<p>no pun intended yeah</p>
<p>no pun intended</p>
<p>but when you talk</p>
<p>about that&rsquo;s the only</p>
<p>thing that you</p>
<p>know the the internet anything is</p>
<p>just like the richard gear gerbil of the but story any</p>
<p>literally anything can be</p>
<p>any new item that happens like</p>
<p>literally gets to your twitter like almost instantly</p>
<p>like my twitter is responsible for</p>
<p>like 80 of the</p>
<p>shit i read online</p>
<p>is like someone</p>
<p>tweets me stuff</p>
<p>you know like dude you</p>
<p>gotta check</p>
<p>this out it&rsquo;s now and i just retweeted back it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>people are tweeting me the most fascinating shit</p>
<p>if i lived 30 years ago</p>
<p>this would have</p>
<p>never happened you</p>
<p>would have to</p>
<p>live in a university town and you</p>
<p>would have to either</p>
<p>teach or you&rsquo;d have to be around students all</p>
<p>the time or you&rsquo;d have to be in some sort of a really</p>
<p>challenging job</p>
<p>where the other people that around you were like really</p>
<p>creative and constantly reviewing information</p>
<p>right in order to get this kind of a</p>
<p>kind of a richness</p>
<p>in like what comes in</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>lucky man and yet</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d say what 7</p>
<p>of internet users take advantage of that</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the hardest part</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s being it&rsquo;s so convoluted you have no idea</p>
<p>where that information is coming from</p>
<p>is it remotely reliable</p>
<p>the internet&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s also a clusterfuck it</p>
<p>is tricky because there was one</p>
<p>thing that i read yesterday</p>
<p>it was really fucking there&rsquo;s a couple that i&rsquo;ve read</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>about this this is the fbi freedom of information act</p>
<p>oh that website we can go and see all the</p>
<p>articles that are up there i</p>
<p>printed this one because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous it&rsquo;s a guy</p>
<p>named guy hotel</p>
<p>h o t t e l</p>
<p>i believe is his name and</p>
<p>yeah and he put out some fucking</p>
<p>freedom of information act thing</p>
<p>about ufos man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>but listen to what it says</p>
<p>an investigator for the air</p>
<p>force stated that</p>
<p>three so called flying</p>
<p>saucers had been recovered</p>
<p>had been recovered in new mexico</p>
<p>they were described as being circular in</p>
<p>shape with ray</p>
<p>centers approximately 50 feet in diameter</p>
<p>each one was</p>
<p>occupied by</p>
<p>three bodies of human</p>
<p>shape but only</p>
<p>three feet tall</p>
<p>dressed in metallic</p>
<p>cloth or a very fine texture</p>
<p>each body was bandaged</p>
<p>in a major it&rsquo;s hard to read that</p>
<p>blogging to the</p>
<p>blackout suits used by</p>
<p>speed flyers</p>
<p>and test pilots</p>
<p>this is some pretty crazy shit</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if this is a hoax</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if this is horse shit</p>
<p>what year was this</p>
<p>it happened in 1950 40</p>
<p>no 196 roswell that they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about or yeah</p>
<p>yeah a bunch of</p>
<p>midgets out</p>
<p>midgets trying to take over the world</p>
<p>crashing their shit</p>
<p>i just don&rsquo;t know if this is</p>
<p>horseshit but</p>
<p>it is on the fbi fucking page it&rsquo;s on the fbi</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the the the</p>
<p>the page on this guy</p>
<p>i mean all saying is that investigator</p>
<p>said right someone said something yeah that&rsquo;s all it</p>
<p>really says i imagine that if there was if that was</p>
<p>any more concrete of proof it</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be out there</p>
<p>still it&rsquo;s one of my favorite</p>
<p>stories man</p>
<p>the the roswell</p>
<p>stories one of my favorite stories</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s pretty universal</p>
<p>that everyone saw something</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s so many people like</p>
<p>general philip corso</p>
<p>and the these or</p>
<p>admiral whatever the fuck is</p>
<p>title is but</p>
<p>all these people that were in the military</p>
<p>that saw things and testified</p>
<p>after the fact</p>
<p>and their stories are so similar</p>
<p>you know after like 10 20 30 years go by</p>
<p>who the fuck knows what you&rsquo;re really remembering</p>
<p>right now who the fuck knows i mean</p>
<p>you pick up a</p>
<p>piece from someone else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>story yeah i mean you talk to oj simpson right now</p>
<p>that guy didn&rsquo;t do it he</p>
<p>might have some</p>
<p>crazy fucking</p>
<p>story in his head</p>
<p>where he really didn&rsquo;t do it i mean who knows</p>
<p>but this new mexico</p>
<p>thing to me is fascinating because they</p>
<p>printed in the paper</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve recovered a</p>
<p>crash flying disc</p>
<p>that the air</p>
<p>force had communicated</p>
<p>to the newspaper we have recovered a ufo</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean it wasn&rsquo;t some sort of a russian</p>
<p>thing it doesn&rsquo;t mean it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>one of their own</p>
<p>things it also</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean it wasn&rsquo;t a fucking flying</p>
<p>saucer either</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>who was saying all this like</p>
<p>maybe the reporter just like</p>
<p>asked some dummy that was like</p>
<p>or saw an alien no</p>
<p>i could tell you because i have it in the oh</p>
<p>yeah in the hallway i have the actual law</p>
<p>thing frame</p>
<p>paper article yeah because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating but no it was</p>
<p>a high level</p>
<p>guy and then the next day he had to come out and do a</p>
<p>press release and they brought pieces of</p>
<p>weather balloon wreckage</p>
<p>and they were saying oh</p>
<p>it was just this</p>
<p>i used to do a joke about it</p>
<p>they said what</p>
<p>about the aliens</p>
<p>all those are mexicans</p>
<p>they were up in a balloon they were</p>
<p>drinking some shenanigans took</p>
<p>place apparently they</p>
<p>mistook the balloon for a pinata</p>
<p>nothing to worry about</p>
<p>by the way we</p>
<p>just invented transistors with very little research</p>
<p>yeah yeah you don&rsquo;t know that one</p>
<p>yeah that was my</p>
<p>the crashed</p>
<p>ufo that they&rsquo;ve recovered the roswell thing</p>
<p>that was yeah that&rsquo;s on 99</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s to go along with my seti one</p>
<p>the seti one is it takes like</p>
<p>three million years for a signal radial signal</p>
<p>reach outside the galaxy</p>
<p>so you send out hello is anyone out there</p>
<p>three million years later what oh yeah yeah</p>
<p>man that&rsquo;s been a while did you ever do the seti</p>
<p>search at home</p>
<p>where your computer would help analyze data</p>
<p>that they got back i thought</p>
<p>about doing it but i&rsquo;m like you&rsquo;re just gonna</p>
<p>hog up my fucking computer yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the dumbest shit ever</p>
<p>what are you gonna do</p>
<p>listen if they want to talk to us they can talk to us</p>
<p>stupid you know i mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s dumb</p>
<p>the idea that</p>
<p>we need to sit around monitoring some fucking</p>
<p>radio spectrum</p>
<p>i think that if anything is</p>
<p>gonna be able to communicate with us from that far away</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna be so fucking far advanced all you</p>
<p>would have to do is be in a different environment</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t have the threat of asteroidal impact</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it that&rsquo;s the big one</p>
<p>asteroid impact in a</p>
<p>stable planet</p>
<p>a planet that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have all the crazy shit</p>
<p>going on this planet does with</p>
<p>super volcanoes and</p>
<p>shifting of the polarized caps and stuff like that</p>
<p>which you know we know happen</p>
<p>i do get the</p>
<p>notion of listening though for the same way that we</p>
<p>might be broadcasting something out like if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna roll your dice</p>
<p>yes there are probably bazillions of</p>
<p>light years</p>
<p>ahead of us in advanced and intelligent but</p>
<p>least common denominator</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>human being species out there that is</p>
<p>still broadcasting i love lucy episodes and</p>
<p>hitler&rsquo;s olympic</p>
<p>opening and you can listen for that i get that notion</p>
<p>yeah i get the notion too but i feel like if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get to us they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get to us</p>
<p>right not to be</p>
<p>you know it just seems</p>
<p>like i love that</p>
<p>woman who the jodie foster</p>
<p>movie contact</p>
<p>with based on</p>
<p>fascinating that</p>
<p>woman is really doing that she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really out there in the middle of the fucking desert</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we need an</p>
<p>alien attack</p>
<p>nothing too drastic to happen but just a common</p>
<p>enemy to unite us all so we&rsquo;ll realize that we are</p>
<p>human beings and get</p>
<p>along if we</p>
<p>could all band together then we</p>
<p>could really research some cool</p>
<p>space travel shit</p>
<p>and teleporters or wells we need</p>
<p>the most trippy</p>
<p>thing would be if we realized that</p>
<p>aliens came from not another planet</p>
<p>but another</p>
<p>dimension oh</p>
<p>from here but in another dimension that they were</p>
<p>dimensional</p>
<p>travelers and you know the concept</p>
<p>of dimensions is pretty fucking squirrely to people</p>
<p>but i always try to explain it</p>
<p>as if it&rsquo;s a radio</p>
<p>think of it</p>
<p>life as a radio and we are currently</p>
<p>tuned in to 971</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s not a 1011</p>
<p>right down the dial that&rsquo;s just as vibrant we just</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t tuned into it</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just not</p>
<p>picking up that frequency</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very possible isn&rsquo;t that what they were</p>
<p>trying to achieve with the hadron collider is obviously</p>
<p>studying black holes and whatnot but</p>
<p>the notion that they</p>
<p>could control that explosion</p>
<p>like if they</p>
<p>built one in space they</p>
<p>could control the explosion and that explosion</p>
<p>would actually be a portal or a wormhole</p>
<p>wow i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about that i know that</p>
<p>the black hole</p>
<p>thing was sort of</p>
<p>that sort of residual</p>
<p>effect of trying to create the higgs boson</p>
<p>particle and</p>
<p>what that is</p>
<p>is a particle a theoretical particle that only</p>
<p>existed milliseconds</p>
<p>after the big bang</p>
<p>which is also theoretical right</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>basically doing is seeing what happens in</p>
<p>the extreme</p>
<p>conditions of the universe</p>
<p>and trying to recreate it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a trippy</p>
<p>thing because</p>
<p>you know the idea is that they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to stop with this</p>
<p>the idea is whatever</p>
<p>findings they</p>
<p>learn from the</p>
<p>large hadron collider will be</p>
<p>applied to the next to the next</p>
<p>giant devices</p>
<p>yeah i mean when they</p>
<p>first came up with</p>
<p>atomic bombs you know that</p>
<p>was the peak of science</p>
<p>and since then it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>accelerated and gotten bigger and crazier and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some shit i&rsquo;m sure that they&rsquo;re working on</p>
<p>right now that we can&rsquo;t even wrap our heads around like</p>
<p>when you hear</p>
<p>about quantum computing are you a computer guy</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a geek squad</p>
<p>member you&rsquo;re a geek web member</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker i can fix your modem when you hear</p>
<p>about quantum computing i have</p>
<p>tried to i&rsquo;ve read</p>
<p>many papers on quantum computing</p>
<p>i take a deep breath and i read them</p>
<p>again and i take a deep breath and i read them</p>
<p>again i try to wrap my fucking</p>
<p>brain around</p>
<p>exactly what they&rsquo;re saying but it&rsquo;s so squirrely</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like whoa this is getting</p>
<p>awful lot like magic</p>
<p>you know this is yeah</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>magic that&rsquo;s the beauty</p>
<p>the notion that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also</p>
<p>going to control</p>
<p>biology they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>wrangle cells to do calculations instead of</p>
<p>creating artificial</p>
<p>leaves have you seen that</p>
<p>is the latest</p>
<p>thing they&rsquo;ve created an artificial leaf that actually</p>
<p>has actual artificial</p>
<p>photosynthesis</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s amazing future</p>
<p>power and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dude yeah the future i mean</p>
<p>i love that you</p>
<p>know i thought disasters</p>
<p>not to bring this to a much</p>
<p>lighter note but i thought disasters in japan</p>
<p>would lead to</p>
<p>of finely intelligent</p>
<p>adult conversation</p>
<p>although i hate the term</p>
<p>adult conversation</p>
<p>about energy in this country i thought</p>
<p>maybe would get us to solar and</p>
<p>looking into</p>
<p>photosynthesis and</p>
<p>other stuff and it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t you know what it&rsquo;s done it&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>started a scare fucking</p>
<p>scare tsunami</p>
<p>you know this</p>
<p>whole country is terrified</p>
<p>in orange county there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>fault line and there&rsquo;s a nuclear</p>
<p>power pen right there what happened</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what everybody&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>about but it&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>to be scared by nuclear energy that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great but channeled that paranoia into</p>
<p>creating positive</p>
<p>technologies instead of relying on coal</p>
<p>and deep sea</p>
<p>drilling see that</p>
<p>would require enlightenment</p>
<p>and we are children</p>
<p>human beings are as</p>
<p>childish as we are allowed to be</p>
<p>you know and i i i see that</p>
<p>everyday i see that in having kids</p>
<p>i see that in just in</p>
<p>human being in lazy behavior people are as childish</p>
<p>and indulgent as they have to be</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re so fascinating when we hear</p>
<p>about some amazon</p>
<p>tribe that goes out and gets</p>
<p>their own fucking water with</p>
<p>you know hollowed out coconuts and</p>
<p>you know they fucking shoot</p>
<p>monkeys with</p>
<p>spear guns and that&rsquo;s what they eat you know like</p>
<p>you read about that and you go</p>
<p>how resourceful like what a</p>
<p>grind they&rsquo;re putting like there&rsquo;s no room for</p>
<p>laziness in that</p>
<p>culture like</p>
<p>these motherfuckers are out there doing it</p>
<p>because we know what&rsquo;s possible with</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>but we also know how we are inclined to sloth</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s so easy for people just be like</p>
<p>yeah who cares</p>
<p>about japan they&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>bunch of faggots</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s so easy it&rsquo;s so easy to</p>
<p>think like that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry it&rsquo;s just i</p>
<p>i have to listen i was</p>
<p>watching a video of a guy</p>
<p>squad on a mason jar and it popped in his ass</p>
<p>what we saying</p>
<p>about we say</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the most disturbing</p>
<p>thing i&rsquo;ve ever seen</p>
<p>one guy one jar</p>
<p>love it right up there with mr hands</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s right up there</p>
<p>have we touched on</p>
<p>well you mentioned something</p>
<p>earlier that i wanted to get back to about</p>
<p>what will we as a society</p>
<p>accept from our government in terms of control when</p>
<p>you revolt and all that stuff</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m still amazed</p>
<p>every damn flight i take</p>
<p>when i look at the tsa</p>
<p>procedures and i see people</p>
<p>just standing in those x ray boxes and</p>
<p>just filling</p>
<p>their bodies with gamma rays to prove that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not a terrorist what do you do do you opt out</p>
<p>no i opt out</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>you got a pat down every time</p>
<p>absolutely wow</p>
<p>absolutely and</p>
<p>there was just a</p>
<p>study recently that they have to retest</p>
<p>a whole bunch of machines because it was like 47</p>
<p>was the number</p>
<p>more radiation was coming out per machine</p>
<p>than what they estimated</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t need some dude getting a fucking</p>
<p>image of myself</p>
<p>on some box that he</p>
<p>could send around i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know and i&rsquo;m a little</p>
<p>dick don&rsquo;t be lying huh</p>
<p>i would i would</p>
<p>never lie i if i were</p>
<p>if i were hung any better i</p>
<p>would be in jail because i would show it off every five</p>
<p>seconds and i like the way you think</p>
<p>yeah i just what you think</p>
<p>constantly constantly depressed at the sad</p>
<p>state of affairs down there there was a guy with a</p>
<p>micropenis that i got in an argument with</p>
<p>about male feminism</p>
<p>yeah and long story but the point is that you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s become like a point of debate</p>
<p>where like some guys have been upset at me like what is</p>
<p>your issue with male feminism</p>
<p>my issue is the same thing as</p>
<p>women that are masculinisms</p>
<p>you know or masculinist throughout it</p>
<p>i mean any women who&rsquo;s only into men</p>
<p>like men power and manpower</p>
<p>or even into it to the point where you&rsquo;re promoting it</p>
<p>just promote equality amongst</p>
<p>human beings as far as the way we treat each other</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something creepy about</p>
<p>male feminists</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why i wanted you to pull up that</p>
<p>video brian and i tweeted this</p>
<p>yesterday it&rsquo;s by</p>
<p>these guys that call themselves the conscious men</p>
<p>okay and it is like</p>
<p>an apology and</p>
<p>a manifesto</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll read the description</p>
<p>an apology on behalf of men or</p>
<p>apology two women</p>
<p>apology to women</p>
<p>and on behalf of men to</p>
<p>women because</p>
<p>they are conscious and they were trying to get in</p>
<p>touch with their femininity</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never seen a bigger group of</p>
<p>what look like date rapists and</p>
<p>creeps and just</p>
<p>annoying fucking weak ass bitches have you been to</p>
<p>comic con no i haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>is it different</p>
<p>is it worse</p>
<p>watch this though you must see this</p>
<p>you have to see this</p>
<p>for folks living</p>
<p>living don&rsquo;t listen to me no matter what i say</p>
<p>listen even if you</p>
<p>agree with me i&rsquo;m an</p>
<p>idiot listen</p>
<p>listen to this</p>
<p>stand before you</p>
<p>today is men committed to</p>
<p>becoming more conscious</p>
<p>in every way</p>
<p>we feel deep love</p>
<p>great respect</p>
<p>and a growing</p>
<p>by the way the man talking</p>
<p>his name is gay hendrix</p>
<p>we also feel deep sorrow</p>
<p>about the destructive actions of the</p>
<p>unconscious</p>
<p>masculine in the past and present</p>
<p>we want to apologize and make amends for</p>
<p>those actions today</p>
<p>so that we can move forward together into a new era</p>
<p>of are they peeing on a</p>
<p>spoon what is</p>
<p>that sound of that</p>
<p>you know what that is that&rsquo;s a fountain bro</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re calm they&rsquo;re enlightened</p>
<p>while listen to the music</p>
<p>listen to me</p>
<p>in you and in all of life</p>
<p>i know that we all have access to the full spectrum</p>
<p>of these energies if you</p>
<p>see this guy you realize how fucking creepy this sounds</p>
<p>awareness this has got to be a</p>
<p>viral for skittles</p>
<p>all dualities free</p>
<p>i admit it i can only</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>kevin ripon</p>
<p>and livian munn</p>
<p>i can work with this big dick</p>
<p>and this was the</p>
<p>music i&rsquo;d play when i was doing</p>
<p>that look at</p>
<p>these guys look at</p>
<p>these i know</p>
<p>that in order to</p>
<p>truly honor you as a</p>
<p>multi dimensional woman</p>
<p>i must stand</p>
<p>fully present by myself</p>
<p>and owen the gifts</p>
<p>i bought drugs from him</p>
<p>absolutely look at this guy</p>
<p>rapist by inerturing each</p>
<p>other in a conscious way</p>
<p>clearly look at his eyes</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got an</p>
<p>ankle bracelet</p>
<p>or two respect</p>
<p>and by worshiping a divinity expressed</p>
<p>in the masculine</p>
<p>and the feminine</p>
<p>that guy&rsquo;s full of shit that guy&rsquo;s just looking for</p>
<p>pussy look at his little</p>
<p>smile at the end has</p>
<p>often been unconscious i feel so</p>
<p>these all look like people that went to a camp to pray</p>
<p>their gay away</p>
<p>you know i mean like that</p>
<p>stare the eyes they all</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s reformed he&rsquo;s totally into</p>
<p>pussy now yeah</p>
<p>whoa what the</p>
<p>is that from wicker man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a woman burning at the</p>
<p>stake they&rsquo;re showing a</p>
<p>woman burning</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like women burning at the</p>
<p>cross here&rsquo;s what you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand fucko that burning at the</p>
<p>cross thing was explained</p>
<p>relegated you to subservient chores</p>
<p>force you to hide your faces and even cut off your</p>
<p>organs of sexual pleasure</p>
<p>well that i</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m getting a little extreme though i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>aware of the</p>
<p>forces of the</p>
<p>unconscious</p>
<p>masculine psyche</p>
<p>pouty there</p>
<p>this guy does not have a</p>
<p>masculine psyche</p>
<p>many of the men who have oppressed this guy&rsquo;s masculine</p>
<p>psyche in his mouth</p>
<p>among the living</p>
<p>many men may</p>
<p>not be able to apologize because they remain shackled</p>
<p>in a prison of anger fear</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a shitty poet dude on behalf of my gender</p>
<p>i apologize to you don&rsquo;t you say shit</p>
<p>on my behalf</p>
<p>i know when we were</p>
<p>angry scared</p>
<p>and then the grip of destructive forces</p>
<p>in our psyche</p>
<p>i choose to no longer</p>
<p>contribute to</p>
<p>those forces</p>
<p>his room smells like it&rsquo;s wood</p>
<p>paneled and stained</p>
<p>with tears and</p>
<p>blood now he</p>
<p>smells like faggotry</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not gonna stop is that</p>
<p>the poker player guy</p>
<p>i acknowledge</p>
<p>is this the most</p>
<p>ridiculous shit ever yeah so what</p>
<p>a thousand years</p>
<p>been mainly</p>
<p>founded by this guy propagated</p>
<p>by men we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>often acted as if we</p>
<p>had brody stevens</p>
<p>and god in the spiritual life</p>
<p>now we are present</p>
<p>with an invite to guys</p>
<p>this has got to end with an invite to a drum circle</p>
<p>this be contest</p>
<p>he just got done selling meth</p>
<p>inclusive spirituality</p>
<p>to honoring the stand away</p>
<p>the hard limit</p>
<p>i honor your deep connection</p>
<p>to the earth</p>
<p>as man all right so i have an any now was that</p>
<p>the point all these guys</p>
<p>just crawled back into my stomach all</p>
<p>these guys are willing to roof you domination</p>
<p>we mistakenly believed</p>
<p>that expansion</p>
<p>would protect us from encroachment</p>
<p>and in the process we violated</p>
<p>the sanctity of the earth</p>
<p>okay stop it</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t watch it right</p>
<p>i understand that they have</p>
<p>good intentions and i&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re not really rapists</p>
<p>but you gotta understand</p>
<p>folks you&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>what we would</p>
<p>classify as</p>
<p>weak ass bitches</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re feeling this way and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why you&rsquo;re feeling like you need to go out and save the</p>
<p>world and make</p>
<p>these women</p>
<p>look women are</p>
<p>gonna be fine yes but what if they</p>
<p>should all be nice to</p>
<p>women absolutely</p>
<p>other than making youtube</p>
<p>videos they&rsquo;re trying to look cool they&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to get really broken</p>
<p>women to like them</p>
<p>you know the kind of</p>
<p>women that like they can&rsquo;t attract</p>
<p>them they&rsquo;re not interesting they&rsquo;re probably not</p>
<p>successful they&rsquo;re not intelligent</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not swole</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>sexually attractive</p>
<p>they probably have nothing</p>
<p>going on those guys</p>
<p>have a mistress</p>
<p>that puts them</p>
<p>in a diaper in a cage and whip them i don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think that that</p>
<p>would be too exciting</p>
<p>they have less than that and they i</p>
<p>think they have that i</p>
<p>think they pay for that really out the nose i</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re just fucking speculating at this</p>
<p>point well aren&rsquo;t we all</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what the</p>
<p>world is right</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s speculate away but what they</p>
<p>are is weak ass bitches and we don&rsquo;t need that what</p>
<p>those men need is</p>
<p>stakes and squats and boot camp</p>
<p>and someone who gets them a fucking interest</p>
<p>whatever the fuck it is man so let&rsquo;s make an apology</p>
<p>video on behalf of men for them we</p>
<p>should that&rsquo;s what it</p>
<p>should be we</p>
<p>should dear</p>
<p>weakass pictures of the</p>
<p>world dear women</p>
<p>dear women who have been</p>
<p>you know compromised by these</p>
<p>knuckleheads that try to</p>
<p>pretend that</p>
<p>men aren&rsquo;t men and</p>
<p>women aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>women and there&rsquo;s some sort of a hybrid that you can be</p>
<p>you can appeal to the</p>
<p>women and embrace your</p>
<p>feminine energy</p>
<p>dude i&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;ve had a</p>
<p>crate and barrel</p>
<p>magazine humping douchebag to walk over your whole life</p>

<p>i mean who am i to tell you</p>

<p>you can do it she&rsquo;s a man now i just got</p>
<p>i thought it was the</p>

<p>i was like okay cool</p>
<p>dude she sent you a text yeah she texted me</p>
<p>oh no i love that how long you been</p>
<p>dating a girl</p>
<p>i think officially</p>
<p>about two years now</p>
<p>two year pimp</p>
<p>music dude so you</p>
<p>never dated olivia</p>
<p>mcmahon you were dating the</p>
<p>whole time to another girl what did you call olivia</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got just</p>
<p>mud dicks in his mouth</p>
<p>were you in that apology video i think</p>
<p>a lot of the internet always</p>
<p>was kind of jealous of you that we never dated</p>
<p>you never dated never messed around never did oh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a distinctly different thing okay</p>
<p>if you want to have you&rsquo;re pretty</p>
<p>lucky that you can&rsquo;t you cannot mix you cannot</p>
<p>mix those parents</p>
<p>you gotta treat them like they&rsquo;re your sisters man</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never had a</p>
<p>sister and i swear to god by the end of that run</p>
<p>i was like i know exactly what it&rsquo;s like to have a</p>
<p>sister yeah</p>
<p>absolutely felt that way what does she smell like</p>
<p>vaginas and flowers dreams wishes burnt salmon</p>
<p>not salmon but you&rsquo;ve been really</p>
<p>successful over at g4</p>
<p>that whole network</p>
<p>pretty much centers around a couple people you and</p>
<p>extended play</p>
<p>people or whatever it&rsquo;s called nowadays but</p>
<p>how did you even fall into that because i mean</p>
<p>when i first</p>
<p>moved to california</p>
<p>i had no friends</p>
<p>zero friends and it was when the</p>
<p>screen savers just</p>
<p>moved to la</p>
<p>and pretty much</p>
<p>i had nothing to do i had no friends so i</p>
<p>would just go to live tapings all the time</p>
<p>just for fun because</p>
<p>i was a huge nerd</p>
<p>yeah that was</p>
<p>a cool show yeah so i got to hang out with like</p>
<p>the kevin rose and</p>
<p>yoshi and all them and</p>
<p>it was the only</p>
<p>thing i did</p>
<p>and how did</p>
<p>you were kind of looked as the bad guy i guess</p>
<p>yeah from the tech tv side of things</p>
<p>i was somehow lumped into</p>
<p>the evil empire that came and absorbed this network and</p>
<p>and we explained to everybody who</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know the history</p>
<p>all right so there was</p>
<p>a network called tech tv</p>
<p>based out of san francisco</p>
<p>which i was a huge fan of super nice</p>
<p>green savers</p>
<p>screen savers</p>
<p>call for help</p>
<p>and what was the dude with the</p>
<p>white hair that</p>
<p>would review games leo</p>
<p>no your tech no</p>
<p>adam sesler</p>
<p>adam sesler</p>
<p>yes yeah he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still on g4 he&rsquo;s on x play</p>
<p>our game show</p>
<p>megan but there was this</p>
<p>weird sort of</p>
<p>buyout of tech tv it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t like some hostile takeover or anything like that</p>
<p>and unfortunately i</p>
<p>think that at the time</p>
<p>the merger was mismanaged it was sort of like well</p>
<p>i think network interests were buying distribution</p>
<p>and not buying content and that was the problem</p>
<p>and so it was just sort of like</p>
<p>okay we have all this distribution now let&rsquo;s just merge</p>
<p>these networks and we&rsquo;ll figure it out let it fly and</p>
<p>so unfortunately i got</p>
<p>stuck in a situation</p>
<p>where they were</p>
<p>transitioning a show that i loved the</p>
<p>screensavers</p>
<p>into this other show</p>
<p>without thinking that the audience</p>
<p>might not like that</p>
<p>you turn on the</p>
<p>dial one day</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the same time the same kind of program</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a different name with</p>
<p>some of the nerdiest</p>
<p>stuff stripped out and all that stuff</p>
<p>and so it got a lot of bad</p>
<p>blood which unfortunately</p>
<p>still exists</p>
<p>today on the</p>
<p>internet like i get it i always tell people</p>
<p>when i meet them that we&rsquo;re tech tv fans that go like</p>
<p>screensavers i go listen dude i love that show too</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>i hope that people realize now it is a different show</p>
<p>and unfortunately the</p>
<p>transition was</p>
<p>rough and awkward and</p>
<p>i still take lumps</p>
<p>for it all the time when i go out what are they upset</p>
<p>about the most like</p>
<p>you said that the geekier elements were</p>
<p>taken away like what</p>
<p>they took away everybody all the people that we like</p>
<p>one of the coolest</p>
<p>things is that</p>
<p>before it all happened the</p>
<p>screensavers</p>
<p>used to have webcams they just put all webcams in</p>
<p>and the day it happened alex put on</p>
<p>this image which is</p>
<p>alex saying</p>
<p>goodbye everyone</p>
<p>and pretty much everyone on the internet</p>
<p>found out about it</p>
<p>first what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy is though i had the same hat</p>
<p>as him and the same</p>
<p>shirt as him</p>
<p>so i put i put</p>
<p>tss is canceled under it</p>
<p>and i had the same outfit and same hat on there</p>
<p>and that got around the internet so everyone thought at</p>
<p>first the screensaver was canceled</p>
<p>and stuff like that and you just do that as a scam</p>
<p>it was a troll as a troll</p>
<p>and then and then</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how fucked up this guy is let me tell you one of the</p>
<p>things he did your fortune</p>
<p>he owned he owned</p>
<p>pepsispice com</p>
<p>okay when pepsi</p>
<p>spice came out</p>
<p>pepsi spice was like this</p>
<p>innovative new beverage yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pepsi but it&rsquo;s spicy</p>
<p>well this asshole</p>
<p>found out that pepsi</p>
<p>spice hadn&rsquo;t gotten their own</p>
<p>domain they didn&rsquo;t secure the domain</p>
<p>so brian starts a</p>
<p>daily blog on</p>
<p>pepsi spice</p>
<p>about going on a</p>
<p>pepsi spice</p>
<p>only diet and he</p>
<p>starts we&rsquo;re only allowed to</p>
<p>drink pepsi&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>to deteriorate your</p>
<p>body it&rsquo;s fucking horrible tell people</p>
<p>is it still up anywhere</p>
<p>no i took it down</p>
<p>cause i was</p>
<p>pepsi so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna sue me or something like that</p>
<p>but it lasted</p>
<p>i said in 30 days i&rsquo;m only</p>
<p>gonna have pepsi</p>
<p>spice so it</p>
<p>started off</p>
<p>where you know the</p>
<p>first couple days i&rsquo;m like i&rsquo;m really hungry but you</p>
<p>know whatever</p>
<p>then it became</p>
<p>like i started getting open sores</p>
<p>i was fucking</p>
<p>pissing blood</p>
<p>and then it got to bad</p>
<p>where my dick is falling off</p>
<p>i was losing like 10</p>
<p>pounds a day or something like by</p>
<p>the way this is like 2000</p>
<p>right yeah this</p>
<p>is this is a while ago</p>
<p>a long time</p>
<p>ago it was probably</p>
<p>like 2004 or something was it 2004 were you here</p>
<p>yeah i was here</p>
<p>when i had nothing to do</p>
<p>except go to the</p>
<p>screensavers no thank</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll get it on but what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy is that i even had</p>
<p>radio interviews they interviewed me on</p>
<p>radio stations because they thought it was real</p>
<p>and then pepsi</p>
<p>started getting in contact and they saying</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re threatening me so i had to kind of</p>
<p>i made my character die</p>
<p>and i took it down</p>
<p>but you can find it</p>
<p>still in google cache and stuff</p>
<p>but you know the</p>
<p>other thing how does that work</p>
<p>how does google cache</p>
<p>work google cache</p>
<p>is kind of like</p>
<p>rss feeds they grab your website</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s not like an rss feed they go out and they</p>
<p>crawl your site</p>
<p>whether you put it out there or not</p>
<p>and so they</p>
<p>crawl your pages</p>
<p>looking for keywords and images or whatever</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re caching all that shit</p>
<p>so they basically have the</p>
<p>whole internet</p>
<p>saved kind of</p>
<p>to an extent yeah they really kind of to</p>
<p>a lot of broken images though but</p>
<p>sure but yeah definitely</p>
<p>done the internet wayback machine yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s internet archive</p>
<p>internet archive</p>
<p>yeah way back machine is so fun you can go</p>
<p>that work it</p>
<p>saves kind of a</p>
<p>thing based off the cache</p>
<p>it saves now</p>
<p>shots of sites there&rsquo;s broken images and whatnot</p>
<p>but you can go back and look at yahoo back in the day</p>
<p>if you had an</p>
<p>old website you can go back and look at it</p>
<p>they can still</p>
<p>do i had a website 98 that was my</p>
<p>first website</p>
<p>thank god youtube wasn&rsquo;t yeah</p>
<p>i was 10 years</p>
<p>old your old websites on there yeah me too</p>
<p>your old websites on there</p>
<p>but this is a question i wanted to ask because you used</p>
<p>to work with</p>
<p>laura foy yeah</p>
<p>i was her pa</p>
<p>laura slash</p>
<p>laura foy who&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>really hot blonde</p>
<p>chick that used to be on a really cool show with</p>
<p>scott rubin and tina woods it&rsquo;s called g4tv com</p>
<p>scott ruben does</p>
<p>live anyways she forgot</p>
<p>one day that her webcam it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>right when they put on webcams so i caught her all</p>
<p>these times just sucking her thumb</p>
<p>and she didn&rsquo;t know the webcam</p>
<p>was on is this</p>
<p>something that</p>
<p>she like openly did around the office because</p>
<p>i even got photos of her when</p>
<p>she found out that the webcam was what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to do dude</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re supposed to do dude is not let that out</p>
<p>and find her</p>
<p>and put honey on your dick</p>
<p>what you supposed to do you remember i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i don&rsquo;t i</p>
<p>think foy would rather have the the</p>
<p>thumb sucking</p>
<p>photos online yeah</p>
<p>then suck honey off a</p>
<p>member personally oh yeah you don&rsquo;t know that she</p>
<p>might be really into that i&rsquo;ve been willing to put</p>
<p>money on it oh you&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>wrong i guarantee you let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in front of a webcam come on dude</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s hoping the fbi is</p>
<p>tuning into that</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s sending that message</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re frigging</p>
<p>our fucking</p>
<p>thumb you&rsquo;re sucking a cock</p>
<p>okay if you&rsquo;re not three</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sucking a cock</p>
<p>remember when kat schwartz put out</p>
<p>a bunch of photos and then somebody</p>
<p>learned about the</p>
<p>thumbnail being</p>
<p>saved in photoshop</p>
<p>what are you talking</p>
<p>about who&rsquo;s cat sports cat</p>
<p>sports used to be also on</p>
<p>the screensaver playboy</p>
<p>like i personally signed pink slips or some shit</p>
<p>that right there</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t see that</p>
<p>used to also</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s my fault</p>
<p>yeah he is very</p>
<p>sensitive i just</p>
<p>got what i meant</p>
<p>you are reacting to all the vile</p>
<p>from the internet</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m actually pretty good friends with</p>
<p>or i&rsquo;m friends with kat and her</p>
<p>baby&rsquo;s daddy and</p>
<p>everything baby&rsquo;s</p>
<p>daddy works for</p>
<p>south park and that&rsquo;s how is</p>
<p>she the girl that was on she did</p>
<p>playboy or something no</p>
<p>no no this is what she did she released some photos of</p>
<p>herself like</p>
<p>model photos</p>
<p>and there were not not new</p>
<p>rc photos taken</p>
<p>by a friend</p>
<p>but what happens is like</p>
<p>when you put in</p>
<p>photoshop it saves like a</p>
<p>thumbnail of the</p>
<p>photo like inside like the information of</p>
<p>like the data inside the</p>
<p>photo like each</p>
<p>photo has data in it</p>
<p>like a lot of times it</p>
<p>has gps information or it has you know what camera was</p>
<p>taken on with the settings</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>extra data in addition</p>
<p>to just the</p>
<p>image yeah so they</p>
<p>she cropped it before she put on the internet but what</p>
<p>it saved the original as a thumbnail</p>
<p>so when she released all these</p>
<p>photos people</p>
<p>found out they opened it up in</p>
<p>photoshop the preview showed the full original</p>
<p>photo of her naked</p>
<p>and so there was all these</p>
<p>photos of cat naked</p>
<p>which was awesome for it kind of like</p>
<p>paris hilton</p>
<p>to her career</p>
<p>but they were</p>
<p>not some of them were not the most flattering of</p>
<p>so explain this to me</p>
<p>again what happens is the original images were</p>
<p>naked it was like</p>
<p>photoshop to them</p>
<p>photoshop had a</p>
<p>feature where you</p>
<p>could publish</p>
<p>a web gallery</p>
<p>publish it directly to the web i think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been a long</p>
<p>while but i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s how the story went</p>
<p>so it actually published</p>
<p>layers that were shut off and</p>
<p>she had cropped one and</p>
<p>again the thumbnail was sort of</p>
<p>saved of the full</p>
<p>image even though she cropped it within the program</p>
<p>oh so how&rsquo;d they access it</p>
<p>they opened it up in</p>
<p>photoshop to look at it and the information</p>
<p>transferred over in</p>
<p>photoshop so you can see the preview</p>
<p>and so then she just pretty much leaked all</p>
<p>these naked photos and</p>
<p>sue the fuck out of photoshop</p>
<p>for her own</p>
<p>ignorance i mean</p>
<p>it benefited</p>
<p>her it benefited you know</p>
<p>there was a program that</p>
<p>would look at people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>photo bucket accounts back in the day and then</p>
<p>procedurally</p>
<p>changed the file names looking for files that were sort</p>
<p>of hidden or not publicized and so many girls had</p>
<p>private photos that they were storing or sending to</p>
<p>their long distance</p>
<p>boyfriends exposed</p>
<p>just by crawling that</p>
<p>there were so many cool</p>
<p>things back in the day when the internet was</p>
<p>still like people were</p>
<p>still figuring out when the</p>
<p>barrier to entry was high</p>
<p>the internet was fucking dope like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll never forget the bulletin</p>
<p>board days we had to</p>
<p>know how to do a dial out telex program</p>
<p>and call some shady dudes computer in a basement</p>
<p>who was hosting porn and</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s games and all that</p>
<p>stuff we were talking</p>
<p>about that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>well and good</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s way better today</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all nice</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very nostalgic</p>
<p>to go back to</p>
<p>those bulletin</p>
<p>board days on a</p>
<p>14 4 moan on cement</p>
<p>it was pavlovian</p>
<p>pavlovian i</p>
<p>would hear those</p>
<p>noises and immediately get erect</p>
<p>cause i knew that man</p>
<p>porn was coming</p>
<p>right doo doo</p>
<p>doo remember</p>
<p>we were talking</p>
<p>about wetricks how we were both</p>
<p>dreamcast fans but remember</p>
<p>going on aol&rsquo;s message</p>
<p>boards and stuff and getting all like</p>
<p>every single</p>
<p>video game possible burnt onto a disc</p>
<p>and that was irc for that it was the best for</p>
<p>dreamcast you ever go into irc rooms that</p>
<p>was a real creepy shit yeah well i used to be a big</p>
<p>quake player</p>
<p>so i used to get on the irc all around were you in</p>
<p>the room when they released q test one</p>
<p>yeah no that was</p>
<p>quake one i was a quick</p>
<p>one i came in at quake two</p>
<p>yeah and i followed it</p>
<p>through quake</p>
<p>iii and into</p>
<p>quake iv quake iv</p>
<p>is when i really had to stop and grow up now it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>quake arena on a web</p>
<p>browser yeah quake</p>
<p>arena is a shit all of it is fucking fun as hell man</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>super time consuming we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about it a hundred times on this podcast it&rsquo;s for the</p>
<p>drinking game</p>
<p>quake quake</p>
<p>quake quake</p>
<p>quake quake haha</p>
<p>blacking out</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re drunk now bitches</p>
<p>next thing you know</p>
<p>so google tv dude</p>
<p>yeah tell me</p>
<p>about yes please</p>
<p>you need to get in on it explain me this it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re in the kitchen</p>
<p>you pop this up and i made you stop talking</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>this is too good threaten me with a butter knife</p>
<p>you have to stop we</p>
<p>need to talk</p>
<p>about this on the podcast</p>
<p>google is going to try to own the living room</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to be them</p>
<p>apple potentially comcast time warner and a few</p>
<p>others that are really</p>
<p>going to be making the play for being the gateway to</p>
<p>media and google is</p>
<p>crushing it</p>
<p>right now basically</p>
<p>google tv you can buy i have the logitech review box</p>
<p>and it has an hdmi pass through</p>
<p>what does that mean that means if you have a</p>
<p>cable box or a</p>
<p>satellite box</p>
<p>you connect that instead of</p>
<p>going directly to the tv or receiver</p>
<p>you plug that into the logitech box</p>
<p>and that goes to your tv and what</p>
<p>that does which no</p>
<p>other box really does is gives you</p>
<p>ability to layer information on top of your tv</p>
<p>all these other</p>
<p>boxes you gotta</p>
<p>switch to another</p>
<p>input and you lose the tv side of</p>
<p>things and it&rsquo;s a different</p>
<p>experience and then you go back to your tv</p>
<p>this one at any</p>
<p>given time you have an argument about</p>
<p>oh what was that actor in</p>
<p>boom you hit the</p>
<p>search button</p>
<p>on your iphone your android</p>
<p>phone or the keyboard</p>
<p>type it in there&rsquo;s imdb</p>
<p>up and running while your</p>
<p>stuff&rsquo;s in a</p>
<p>picture in picture window</p>
<p>you want access to podcasts and</p>
<p>videocasts you hit the home button</p>
<p>go to their spotlight</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>a website that&rsquo;s doing an app</p>
<p>where you watch</p>
<p>models go down a runway</p>
<p>and it tells you</p>
<p>about the fashion they&rsquo;re wearing and if you want you</p>
<p>press ok and it pulls up the website</p>
<p>while the video is</p>
<p>still going you can</p>
<p>order it right from there</p>
<p>on your tv and it&rsquo;s got a full web the box is a little</p>
<p>underpowered</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a little netbook in there it&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>underpowered</p>
<p>but this as a step one is</p>
<p>there one that&rsquo;s coming out soon that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>better one or is there a</p>
<p>better google tv than the</p>
<p>other is the sony</p>
<p>one the best i</p>
<p>think the logitech</p>
<p>is a little better than</p>
<p>the sony because of the remotes and the apps themselves</p>
<p>but as long as content providers don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>completely fuck this platform over</p>
<p>which they&rsquo;re trying to do left and</p>
<p>right because they&rsquo;re also scared</p>
<p>it will be amazing</p>
<p>how are they trying to fuck it over by</p>
<p>blocking their content</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s doing this</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if i can name names name name says</p>
<p>boycott let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>start a fucking revolution together</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll tell you what i wanted to watch the</p>
<p>south park episode the</p>
<p>other day and i went and pulled up</p>
<p>south park&rsquo;s website and</p>
<p>now again if i had my laptop</p>
<p>i can pull it up</p>
<p>right there and</p>
<p>watch the full high def</p>
<p>south park episode</p>
<p>sit through commercials or whatever be</p>
<p>right there when i</p>
<p>tried to pull it up on my tv it popped up and said oh</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to access this from a google tv device oh</p>
<p>sorry wait is that comcast your</p>
<p>block right now no that&rsquo;s it was</p>
<p>south park so i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s viacom i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m safe</p>
<p>to make fun of them right</p>
<p>but it also did</p>
<p>on who blocks</p>
<p>it so does hulu</p>
<p>which is fucking frustrating</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>annoying because</p>
<p>the same ads that</p>
<p>their worry is that the google</p>
<p>experience is too good you&rsquo;re sitting on your</p>
<p>couch and this content that&rsquo;s for free on the internet</p>
<p>is easily accessible</p>
<p>and i go well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same ads and the same content that i&rsquo;d have if</p>
<p>i turned over here if you had a mac mini hook up your</p>
<p>tv and use my laptop</p>
<p>or use my whatever someone over there is not getting it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m willing to sit through the ad i&rsquo;m willing</p>
<p>to make it worth your while</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like when i try to go</p>
<p>watch a movie</p>
<p>these days i don&rsquo;t know if you</p>
<p>i tried to legally acquire content now</p>
<p>actually tried it the</p>
<p>other day i wanted to</p>
<p>watch jurassic park</p>
<p>so i checked my xbox</p>
<p>i checked my</p>
<p>video on demand</p>
<p>i checked the sony network</p>
<p>i checked netflix</p>
<p>i checked amazon</p>
<p>i went through service</p>
<p>after service</p>
<p>and finally said fuck it i went looked at bit torrent</p>
<p>there was the high def</p>
<p>rip there was the blu ray rip with all the</p>
<p>extras i clicked</p>
<p>and an hour</p>
<p>later i&rsquo;m watching it on my tv</p>
<p>i tried to give somebody</p>
<p>money for that movie</p>
<p>and was unable to same shit happened to me the</p>
<p>other two it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically the old guard</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t really accepted the new technologies</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s this new</p>
<p>thing and they&rsquo;re scared of it and jurassic park that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous well i mean that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>jurassic park that</p>
<p>should be on netflix</p>
<p>streaming that</p>
<p>should do yeah</p>
<p>exactly i mean that</p>
<p>should be everywhere</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible when you get google tv man</p>
<p>it will satirize</p>
<p>you it&rsquo;s that good</p>
<p>wow it&rsquo;s really that good and it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>frustrating that people are</p>
<p>blocking content though</p>
<p>super frustrating</p>
<p>i mean look there&rsquo;s ways around it but</p>
<p>is there a reason do they have a</p>
<p>legitimate argument</p>
<p>well is there a bill burr rss feed</p>
<p>interaction in here no there&rsquo;s nothing that makes</p>
<p>sense just like that argument</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re worried that</p>
<p>again the experience is too good</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t just give that content away how can we charge</p>
<p>extra for that</p>
<p>content like hulu says they&rsquo;re working with google</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna try to charge for hulu plus</p>
<p>on the google tv or something like that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fuckers</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s nickel and diming left so you&rsquo;d have to</p>
<p>pay for google tv</p>
<p>do you have</p>
<p>is it a subscription</p>
<p>based service or is it</p>
<p>free see that&rsquo;s the beauty of google tv is free google</p>
<p>is free it&rsquo;s terrifying and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great overlay if</p>
<p>we really found out</p>
<p>that artificial intelligence actually does</p>
<p>exist and what it is is google</p>
<p>and that google</p>
<p>figured out a way to fucking program the universe</p>
<p>and own everything</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s so weird</p>
<p>i use a government chrome browser</p>
<p>i use gmail</p>
<p>i mean come on man it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>apple and google and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be the big</p>
<p>fight for all of your data and all your</p>
<p>media access and all your management</p>
<p>maybe google amazon but</p>
<p>fuck man it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>right in there did you see the onion bit about</p>
<p>facebook being created by the cia</p>
<p>as a data mining tool</p>
<p>no fucking brilliant that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny they basically said that you</p>
<p>know facebook was launched as a</p>
<p>secret program and it took off widely</p>
<p>successful they</p>
<p>never imagined that</p>
<p>citizens would give up all</p>
<p>their photos</p>
<p>their likes</p>
<p>their dislikes</p>
<p>their locations</p>
<p>checkouts it&rsquo;s like imagine</p>
<p>forget google that&rsquo;s the data set that&rsquo;s scary</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that google long</p>
<p>longitude or whatever</p>
<p>where it just</p>
<p>tracks you all day that&rsquo;s even</p>
<p>worse to me that&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>yeah we were talking</p>
<p>about street</p>
<p>view longitude</p>
<p>you know what that is</p>
<p>what is that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where your</p>
<p>phone pretty much so</p>
<p>tells your friends</p>
<p>where you are exactly</p>
<p>where you are you</p>
<p>could track your</p>
<p>girlfriend exactly driving down the street</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just sending it to google</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a great idea</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird how it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>creeping up on us if it leads to better ads and my</p>
<p>email cool but it&rsquo;s just amazing how fucking ambitious</p>
<p>google is they&rsquo;re so ambitious</p>
<p>i mean that do this and the</p>
<p>browser and cars that</p>
<p>drive themselves</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t they working on an operating system</p>
<p>they already have</p>
<p>chromium it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>based on chrome yeah</p>
<p>and honeycomb for</p>
<p>tablets which is</p>
<p>gonna be awesome</p>
<p>their operating</p>
<p>system is available</p>
<p>right now you can download</p>
<p>chromium for certain</p>
<p>netbooks you can hack</p>
<p>it right now have you</p>
<p>tried it yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not where it needs to be net</p>
<p>the idea is that in the future</p>
<p>cloud computing is</p>
<p>going to lead to i mean we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>laugh at the</p>
<p>fact that this has a processor that has a processor</p>
<p>that computer behind you has ram</p>
<p>and chips in it we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna laugh at that what a</p>
<p>waste of resources it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be oh yeah</p>
<p>your phone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be streaming</p>
<p>basically yeah</p>
<p>basically all you need</p>
<p>is whatever</p>
<p>technology needs to happen to</p>
<p>stream a high def</p>
<p>signal at 60 or 30 to 60</p>
<p>frames a second to whatever device there is</p>
<p>so the idea is that in the future</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll just have a</p>
<p>screen or you&rsquo;ll walk into a</p>
<p>hotel you&rsquo;ll sit at a terminal</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll punch in your info or it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>scan your retina</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ll pee in a cup however they&rsquo;ll do it</p>
<p>and all of a</p>
<p>sudden your desktop appears like that</p>
<p>all of your shit&rsquo;s on it you</p>
<p>leave you pick up your</p>
<p>phone your desktop appears</p>
<p>on it like that&rsquo;s the future of</p>
<p>cloud computing</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be stored</p>
<p>and processed in servers that we don&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll be beamed</p>
<p>quick enough and it already</p>
<p>exists today</p>
<p>and phantom&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to bring it to you</p>
<p>phantom phantom</p>
<p>yeah that was a</p>
<p>vaporware console</p>
<p>but like if you look at onlive</p>
<p>which is a gaming service it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>quite there</p>
<p>yet but the idea is that you buy one box well</p>
<p>did you guys just geek the fuck out</p>
<p>shit yeah you did</p>
<p>right phantom was</p>
<p>a i just wanna</p>
<p>check phantom was supposed to be a console that</p>
<p>would sit in your living room</p>
<p>and pull games out of the</p>
<p>cloud essentially</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d never have to buy a disc or whatever you</p>
<p>could play from the comfort of your</p>
<p>couch and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>streaming video games yeah</p>
<p>and it was fast enough supposedly to be able to play</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s no drop in</p>
<p>frame rate where you</p>
<p>could actually you know</p>
<p>and that was all bullshit that was all a</p>
<p>money laundering</p>
<p>scheme so some dude</p>
<p>could crash ferraris down to pan</p>
<p>canyon or whatever oh is that guy yeah yeah</p>
<p>but i remember that there&rsquo;s a company called onlive</p>
<p>that is one of many there&rsquo;s another app called iq that</p>
<p>was pretty legit</p>
<p>we used it the</p>
<p>other day and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got its hiccups but imagine when</p>
<p>you log into service you&rsquo;d see thousands of windows</p>
<p>streaming call of duty and streaming</p>
<p>gears of war and all this stuff</p>
<p>and you can go and</p>
<p>click on it and</p>
<p>those are actually people playing live</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re spectating all</p>
<p>their games and they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>streaming in real time</p>
<p>and then if</p>
<p>you want to play the game they&rsquo;re playing you</p>
<p>press a button</p>
<p>it pulls you out of it and launches you</p>
<p>right into that game</p>
<p>wow that exists</p>
<p>today now it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a five out of five just yet what is it now four</p>
<p>three probably a</p>
<p>three two or three</p>
<p>i think is what we gave it</p>
<p>but the promise is there</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s what google&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to make this operating system where</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t store shit locally it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>google docs and google paint and</p>
<p>google image</p>
<p>video editor and all that shit it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>gonna live in the cloud</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so ambitious</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so creepy they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right they&rsquo;re absolutely right on that one you know</p>
<p>like microsoft always</p>
<p>creep me out too bill gates always creep me out like</p>
<p>anyone who&rsquo;s that ambitious</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying that hard</p>
<p>like come on man</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>why does that creep you out i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>cause they have so</p>
<p>many different products and they&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>successful you&rsquo;re very ambitious</p>
<p>no no not in that</p>
<p>way i don&rsquo;t want to control anybody else&rsquo;s information</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>thing that always bugs me like here&rsquo;s a perfect example</p>
<p>like the ipad like</p>
<p>or the iphone</p>
<p>exactly i made a</p>
<p>video a long time ago</p>
<p>where it pretty much</p>
<p>broke down like one of the two</p>
<p>iphones and you guys actually played it on your show</p>
<p>where it remember when i had that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m an old iphone and i&rsquo;m an old cell</p>
<p>phone from three years ago</p>
<p>it was like i have a camera and jessica</p>
<p>did that yeah</p>
<p>yeah it was a pretty big</p>
<p>video and stuff like that but</p>
<p>it was based on</p>
<p>basic things like the ipad</p>
<p>where the first ipad didn&rsquo;t have a camera the</p>
<p>second one has a camera and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>things like do you think</p>
<p>that apple is actually doing that on purpose</p>
<p>is that a part of</p>
<p>their market</p>
<p>totally i mean</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll do the research</p>
<p>and do enough</p>
<p>focus groups to</p>
<p>find out what features they have to include to make it</p>
<p>amazing palatable</p>
<p>magical revolutionary</p>
<p>whatever yeah so then they go okay</p>
<p>the next version will have all</p>
<p>these things just like when this launched without</p>
<p>picture messaging and all sorts of</p>
<p>stuff right yeah like</p>
<p>they know what the consumer is willing to put up with</p>
<p>especially those early</p>
<p>adopters that</p>
<p>picture messaging thing was</p>
<p>typing in the code that was the most</p>
<p>ridiculous thing ever</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;d get</p>
<p>you go to at</p>
<p>amp t wireless</p>
<p>dot whatever and put in this</p>
<p>login in this past and it was a tiny ass little</p>
<p>image too wasn&rsquo;t the full</p>
<p>image it was ridiculous</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>to me and not to get on a nerdy</p>
<p>rant but that&rsquo;s all i really have to offer this world</p>
<p>is the fucking fact that if let&rsquo;s say i have verizon</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m paying 40</p>
<p>bucks a month for</p>
<p>their data plan and at amp</p>
<p>t is no better</p>
<p>and then if i want to</p>
<p>tether that</p>
<p>phone to my laptop</p>
<p>to use this as a modem</p>
<p>i gotta pay an extra fee</p>
<p>but it still</p>
<p>eats away at the bandwidth that i&rsquo;m paying 40 bucks for</p>
<p>is that because</p>
<p>the fcc and</p>
<p>senators don&rsquo;t realize that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all the same bandwidth</p>
<p>no i think it&rsquo;s verizon</p>
<p>making money</p>
<p>yeah well of course</p>
<p>verizon&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of shitty with the fucking</p>
<p>if we get that</p>
<p>changed at amp</p>
<p>t does the same they charge you</p>
<p>extra at a tether but it&rsquo;s the same bandwidth</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m paying</p>
<p>monthly for</p>
<p>verizon is shity</p>
<p>screwed to use that</p>
<p>their data service is not very good</p>
<p>i had a at amp t</p>
<p>phone of iphone and then i got a verizon</p>
<p>iphone recently</p>
<p>and one thing</p>
<p>i noticed is that i&rsquo;ll have a full 3g signal on verizon</p>
<p>and then i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>start downloading something</p>
<p>like an app or something and it&rsquo;ll kick off 3g</p>
<p>at amp t kicks you off it kicks you</p>
<p>off better than verizon</p>
<p>yeah have you seen their lte</p>
<p>network long term</p>
<p>evolution no</p>
<p>that shit is fast</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s new</p>
<p>right yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where is it</p>
<p>where is it have it</p>
<p>verizon&rsquo;s is out no</p>
<p>but i mean where oh</p>
<p>can you get it</p>
<p>everywhere i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about here you can get in los angeles</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>pretty it&rsquo;s pretty common spotty</p>
<p>spotty spotty</p>
<p>by the end of the year htc</p>
<p>thunderbolt has that right</p>
<p>that looks pretty badass</p>
<p>i mean like we were</p>
<p>even in our little</p>
<p>studio which is like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kryptonite to all signals it&rsquo;s a little shoebox</p>
<p>but in there the lte</p>
<p>was as fast as a</p>
<p>cable modem was</p>
<p>wow and so the idea is</p>
<p>again the whole net neutrality</p>
<p>thing that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>worried about</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll buy a verizon</p>
<p>wireless lte router</p>
<p>for your home</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll wirelessly pull down your bandwidth and</p>
<p>share it with everybody else</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s that fast now wireless wow yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>things i have to change a cell</p>
<p>phone so like i have batteries</p>
<p>palm pre plus</p>
<p>i got stuck with the verizon</p>
<p>i went out so bad and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna cost me now</p>
<p>350 to cancel</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve had it for a year and</p>
<p>a half almost a year and i just want to cancel i just</p>
<p>yeah that phone seemed real</p>
<p>promising before</p>
<p>it actually came out and i was like well it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>shitty and wonky they</p>
<p>dropped it dude i got</p>
<p>a new droid a droid 2 global because</p>
<p>i love verizon</p>
<p>service i had a</p>
<p>blackberry before</p>
<p>and i wanted to get verizon</p>
<p>service but i wanted it to be global</p>
<p>so i said oh well here&rsquo;s a solution</p>
<p>all these people love the droid i mean i</p>
<p>heard howard</p>
<p>stern talking</p>
<p>about how he loves his droid</p>
<p>i got it it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a drunk retarded iphone it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>stupid and like</p>
<p>the first time i used it i go to</p>
<p>slide the screen to open it up</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>shake stutter</p>
<p>shake stutter</p>
<p>shake stutter</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like whoa whoa whoa whoa really</p>
<p>this does dude</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t even know how to harness</p>
<p>how much power it has that</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s scared by its own ability i</p>
<p>played with it for 20 minutes and the battery was half</p>
<p>drained and i was like you</p>
<p>gotta be fucking kidding me i mean that&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>like i can&rsquo;t even fuck around and just</p>
<p>play with it i went online i</p>
<p>checked what it looks like on one website i</p>
<p>checked my email</p>
<p>20 minutes and it was half</p>
<p>dead i was like that&rsquo;s just preposterous</p>
<p>and people like oh no you</p>
<p>gotta get a</p>
<p>mobile application command</p>
<p>a power command and</p>
<p>shut off this and do this it&rsquo;s like no i didn&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna hack my devices anymore i just want them to work</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>fundamental there&rsquo;s so many people that have this</p>
<p>thing about</p>
<p>fuck jailbreaking man that&rsquo;s too complicated</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many people though that have this anti</p>
<p>apple sentiment</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a real like</p>
<p>these threads come up on a message</p>
<p>board all the time and it&rsquo;s so dumb</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the dumbest conversation ever</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>metroverse bags</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the number one argument max</p>
<p>if i was a fucking fag and i</p>
<p>could use a</p>
<p>mac i didn&rsquo;t know how to use a real computer</p>
<p>but if you want to buy a</p>
<p>tesla at the</p>
<p>genius bar you can by swallowing</p>
<p>really it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little non</p>
<p>what about girls it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>apple care what</p>
<p>about those girls the genius</p>
<p>alright i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna swallow them too absolutely</p>
<p>swallow whatever they&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>whatever you got</p>
<p>the biggest</p>
<p>shoot the biggest</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m hardcore unix guy command lines only</p>
<p>switch to windows</p>
<p>i was a network administrator back in the day</p>
<p>when i switched to mac i&rsquo;m like listen</p>
<p>shit works and if i really want to</p>
<p>drill down and get deep i can</p>
<p>pop open a terminal window and do whatever i need to do</p>
<p>the people that</p>
<p>are anti mac just like the mac people who are anti pc</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a team</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a dumb team</p>
<p>thing and the macs are the</p>
<p>liberals the macs are the weak pussies and then</p>
<p>for macs the pcs are all</p>
<p>sarah palin&rsquo;s</p>
<p>same thing with consoles like playstation owners like</p>
<p>fuck you 360 fanboy</p>
<p>xbox owners like</p>
<p>playstations for douchebags</p>
<p>no one wants to be</p>
<p>wrong no one wants to</p>
<p>admit that they</p>
<p>might have bought the</p>
<p>console that has a problem or</p>
<p>spent money on the game</p>
<p>that had a problem they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t wanna be</p>
<p>right and it&rsquo;s like you know what you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna be right all the time that&rsquo;s with</p>
<p>everything so</p>
<p>shut the protestant</p>
<p>versus the catholics</p>
<p>you know that whole</p>
<p>mac versus pc</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s such a strange one though to me</p>
<p>i wonder how</p>
<p>many people like whether they&rsquo;re politicians or</p>
<p>people trying to appeal to a certain</p>
<p>class of society</p>
<p>will choose</p>
<p>a pc over a mac</p>
<p>to let you know hey i&rsquo;m a part of the proletariat</p>
<p>like obama saying hey i got an ipad</p>
<p>when he made a big deal out of that</p>
<p>yeah like i use an ipad i&rsquo;m a president of the united</p>
<p>states yeah must</p>
<p>be right yeah sending</p>
<p>a message this is a higher end president this is</p>
<p>a more connected a</p>
<p>multi touch sensitive</p>
<p>he was the first</p>
<p>president to</p>
<p>bring a laptop to the</p>
<p>white house</p>
<p>are you serious yeah</p>
<p>yeah well i remember he</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t give up his</p>
<p>blackberry at the time</p>
<p>which i thought</p>
<p>was cool yeah because it wasn&rsquo;t secure yeah</p>
<p>one thing i wish the ipad had was i can&rsquo;t believe it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have is multiple</p>
<p>users i hate it when people want to like borrow</p>
<p>my ipad i&rsquo;m like okay i&rsquo;m logged into facebook twitter</p>
<p>email everything i mean girls</p>
<p>yeah girls why</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t that that seems like a basic</p>
<p>thing that i</p>
<p>should have by now this is what you say listen</p>
<p>bitch get your own</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you</p>
<p>gotta say you</p>
<p>gotta fuck her correctly</p>
<p>okay leave her all</p>
<p>panting and</p>
<p>sweating then she goes can</p>
<p>i can i use your ipad you</p>
<p>listen bitch you know i love you</p>
<p>get your own fucking ipad</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;ll giggle</p>
<p>haha and she&rsquo;ll drop it</p>
<p>why cause you fucked her correctly brian</p>
<p>okay is that therein lies the</p>
<p>issue yes or get another ipad you can have mine</p>
<p>and just fucking use it all right deal</p>
<p>give it to her tell her she</p>
<p>could use it as long as you&rsquo;re looking over her</p>
<p>shoulder because she&rsquo;s in like a downward dog</p>
<p>position yeah</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re behind her</p>
<p>then you can play all the fucking</p>
<p>dungeon raid you want did you</p>
<p>learn to play the drums</p>
<p>using rock band or have you always been a drummer</p>
<p>self taught been drumming for a</p>
<p>while have you been in a band before</p>
<p>several several</p>
<p>shitty bands jazz bands hardcore rap</p>
<p>metal bands</p>
<p>everything yeah really what kind of jazz</p>
<p>you name it i mean we did we</p>
<p>take five what</p>
<p>bands have the biggest percentage of douchebags in them</p>
<p>what music well i mean they all do it just a christian</p>
<p>douchebag you are</p>
<p>christian rock</p>
<p>jars of clarified christian</p>
<p>rock rules dude they</p>
<p>all you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about they all have</p>
<p>douchebags in them but i mean i think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the number one</p>
<p>issue though with bands</p>
<p>right i mean</p>
<p>eddie bravo has been in bands his</p>
<p>whole life and he said the number one issue</p>
<p>has always been</p>
<p>dealing with</p>
<p>trying to manage</p>
<p>all the egos in the band it&rsquo;s like hurting cats</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what kills so many bands not cats it is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re running around like that</p>
<p>like i heard cats yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s perfect</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve seen that with many bands that i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>in but it&rsquo;s just man it&rsquo;s fucking hard to make music</p>
<p>these days as easy as it gets</p>
<p>with distribution and the tools to make it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still really fucking hard to make good</p>
<p>music these days has that always been your</p>
<p>dream to be in a band or what was you</p>
<p>think i would</p>
<p>quit it all in a</p>
<p>second yeah i&rsquo;d quit</p>
<p>everything in a</p>
<p>second to go make</p>
<p>music for a living</p>
<p>of life really</p>
<p>theoretically yes but obviously i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t done that yet so how old are you</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m 28 oh you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still okay no</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still young</p>
<p>tread on my tires no</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re young if you were 38 i</p>
<p>would go ooh yeah</p>
<p>good luck of music</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>i fancy myself a non judgmental person</p>
<p>but i fucking</p>
<p>judge people when they</p>
<p>look at me and tell me that they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>appreciate music</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve met a surprising number of them</p>
<p>recently who</p>
<p>tells you they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>appreciate music</p>
<p>i know a lot of people who say</p>
<p>i just don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>music explain</p>
<p>give me one</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t wanna hear your songs</p>
<p>you want me suck your dick or what</p>
<p>i hear you listening to your</p>
<p>music that&rsquo;s the kind of hooker</p>
<p>kevin gets to</p>
<p>really really whiny hooker that doesn&rsquo;t like the house</p>
<p>music i laugh that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>crackhead hugh grant type hooker</p>
<p>none of that that girl became famous for a little bit</p>
<p>yeah after hugh grant got that blowjob</p>
<p>so what like</p>
<p>explain i&rsquo;ve met people that will say they&rsquo;re not into</p>
<p>music and i don&rsquo;t get that</p>
<p>cause to me it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a universal language just as much math but i think even</p>
<p>more so than math</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s inherent</p>
<p>there should be a love or a</p>
<p>sense or an</p>
<p>understanding of</p>
<p>rhythm there&rsquo;s something special</p>
<p>about it there&rsquo;s something unique</p>
<p>about it that we&rsquo;re not really addressing</p>
<p>right it changes</p>
<p>the way your physical body feels it makes you more</p>
<p>excited it does</p>
<p>things to you inspires you it makes you feel good</p>
<p>brings you back to moments of your childhood</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the most incredible</p>
<p>works of art forms of art that we have i agree</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so weird and</p>
<p>the science behind some of it</p>
<p>i wanted to know why</p>
<p>house music</p>
<p>was something that persistent thump</p>
<p>got me up and</p>
<p>made me want to move and it seems to move some people</p>
<p>and whatnot</p>
<p>and its lower end</p>
<p>frequencies are</p>
<p>triggered to primal portions of our</p>
<p>brain that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sensitive to hearing</p>
<p>approaching animals and elephant herds and all that</p>
<p>stuff so it</p>
<p>triggers that</p>
<p>oh i better wake up be</p>
<p>alert gotta get</p>
<p>going and so that persistent thump</p>
<p>drives you and keeps you</p>
<p>going there&rsquo;s so much craziness</p>
<p>going on so tribal</p>
<p>music like literally like fires up shit in your brain</p>
<p>you should wake that up to that morning</p>
<p>i play stampede elephants when i wake up that&rsquo;s all i</p>
<p>listen to dude you need to get on a podcast with</p>
<p>eddie bravo we need to have you and him together</p>
<p>cause he&rsquo;s got some</p>
<p>crazy theories</p>
<p>about music and</p>
<p>the 12 notes and the 12 astrological series</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t there a 13th</p>
<p>astrological sign i</p>
<p>think we just</p>
<p>found one yeah and it</p>
<p>shifted people</p>
<p>they were like oh my horoscopes have been</p>
<p>wrong i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>yeah let me</p>
<p>google that real quick</p>
<p>but i like being a leo i don&rsquo;t want to be</p>
<p>a whatever i forget what i&rsquo;m now</p>
<p>if with the new method are you really something</p>
<p>different yeah it</p>
<p>changed a lot of</p>
<p>people you were a leo before of course you&rsquo;re a leo too</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re both leo</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s yours what is your date</p>
<p>august 4th and</p>
<p>your august 11th yeah you&rsquo;re not a real leo i like to</p>
<p>think mrs leo cut you off</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m still a leo</p>
<p>they cut you off are you serious</p>
<p>they cut you off bitch</p>
<p>let me say august 10th nope you&rsquo;re cut off son</p>
<p>through september 16th</p>
<p>you were august 9th is that what you said</p>
<p>august 4th august 4th it&rsquo;s over bitch i</p>
<p>know right now</p>
<p>like something gay you&rsquo;re cancer</p>
<p>you guys subscribe to this perfect</p>
<p>oh i don&rsquo;t know not really</p>
<p>i think miss cleo</p>
<p>got a panel together in her ivory</p>
<p>tower and said listen astrology&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kinda we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using the google</p>
<p>searches let&rsquo;s create a new sign</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s check this new</p>
<p>crafty one though</p>
<p>o p h i u c</p>
<p>h u s how&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>spell what do</p>
<p>you say that how do you pronounce that oh perfect</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the new one that&rsquo;s november</p>
<p>twenty ninth to december seventeenth</p>
<p>so if you you have that crafty new zodiac sign</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know you know how the moon affects</p>
<p>like the ocean</p>
<p>right like you know the</p>
<p>tides the tides and</p>
<p>everything like that have you ever thought that</p>
<p>maybe the moon</p>
<p>changes us because we&rsquo;re like what 99 percent water</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>fuck with us too</p>
<p>like we would have some own tide and shit</p>
<p>going on and everything</p>
<p>does but but</p>
<p>is that a yearly thing is there the moon cycle</p>
<p>yeah the moon cycles year that&rsquo;s what seasons is</p>
<p>right the real problem is it would have to be a real</p>
<p>radical drastic change for them to measure it</p>
<p>like it might just</p>
<p>because it changes the way you feel statistically it</p>
<p>might not show a significant jump as far as like</p>
<p>you know like disease or</p>
<p>heart attacks</p>
<p>or assaults or anything</p>
<p>crazy because i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ever been anything statistically connected</p>
<p>to lunar activity but</p>
<p>when you hear something like lunatic</p>
<p>you hear like the</p>
<p>expression lunatic</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s connected to</p>
<p>full moons and</p>
<p>lunar that is</p>
<p>lunar that is the moon i mean that is ancient</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something to it there&rsquo;s something to it</p>
<p>and it might be as simple as</p>
<p>when the moon is out people</p>
<p>start freaking because you can see at</p>
<p>night you can see at night</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a full moon</p>
<p>great i can see who i&rsquo;m mugging exactly</p>
<p>i can see who i&rsquo;m raised to asshole yeah</p>
<p>i could yeah</p>
<p>it could be that easy</p>
<p>they really</p>
<p>could i mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a big difference</p>
<p>or you grow up with imagery of oh full moon</p>
<p>and you hear that&rsquo;s when the crazies come out in the</p>
<p>little towel and you go all</p>
<p>right now&rsquo;s my time well that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>things i was</p>
<p>throwing off</p>
<p>mma shirts and go</p>
<p>punch them ladies</p>
<p>that dear woman</p>
<p>fucking no explode this dear</p>
<p>woman thing one of the things that pisses me off is the</p>
<p>women they&rsquo;re not crosses excuse me burning</p>
<p>women at the</p>
<p>stake the witches burning witches at the stake</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve connected that to ergot</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve connected that to</p>
<p>fungus that grew on wheat because they had a late frost</p>
<p>and then it fucked up their crops</p>
<p>and the wheat</p>
<p>was frozen and then when you have wheat that you know</p>
<p>like if food</p>
<p>you like freeze food and then thaw it out and freeze it</p>
<p>again it&rsquo;s really dangerous</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s not good yeah</p>
<p>and all of a sudden yeah and fungus and</p>
<p>one of the things that they&rsquo;ve shown in</p>
<p>grain samples from that era</p>
<p>from that time the</p>
<p>salem witch trials was that</p>
<p>these fucking people were high on lsd</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t even know it</p>
<p>they were eating ergot</p>
<p>they were eating this</p>
<p>bread that has this fungus on it and it has a massive</p>
<p>psychological effect</p>
<p>so of course they thought there was witchcraft</p>
<p>of course they thought they were</p>
<p>under spell you know</p>
<p>they were so confused they were high as fuck on lsd</p>
<p>probably massive</p>
<p>crazy almost psychotic doses</p>
<p>right well in</p>
<p>daily doses yeah on doses</p>
<p>upon doses of that i mean it&rsquo;s not like that should</p>
<p>i mean the half life is there but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll compound in your</p>
<p>system and by the way there&rsquo;s modern</p>
<p>versions of</p>
<p>what the cia</p>
<p>did in france</p>
<p>where they dosed up an entire town</p>
<p>they put it in</p>
<p>their bread</p>
<p>and they monitor</p>
<p>these people and</p>
<p>dude people died they committed suicide they jumped off</p>
<p>buildings i mean</p>
<p>people lost</p>
<p>their fucking minds</p>
<p>some people</p>
<p>never came back and they did this across the</p>
<p>board they did this to children</p>
<p>they did it to old people</p>
<p>so we know that you can cause</p>
<p>mass chaos and</p>
<p>hysteria by just dosing everybody up with acid</p>
<p>and you know back then you didn&rsquo;t pass on</p>
<p>bread there was no like um</p>
<p>you know gluten no i&rsquo;m good</p>
<p>thanks yeah</p>
<p>you ate your</p>
<p>bread because</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>might not get anything i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>south beaching i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry it&rsquo;s cleansing</p>
<p>do you hate do you go</p>
<p>crazy when you hear people</p>
<p>cleansing i&rsquo;m coming to</p>
<p>cleanse yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not for me i&rsquo;m not cayenne</p>
<p>pepper cayenne</p>
<p>pepper and lemon juice</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all i got</p>
<p>right now and i go to boot camp and then hate myself</p>
<p>but buy a purse and</p>
<p>throw up into it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cleansing just everybody wants to</p>
<p>fix what they&rsquo;ve already fucked up i did that shit for</p>
<p>seven days where you just</p>
<p>drink lemon</p>
<p>water charcoal</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>eat anything it&rsquo;s charcoal</p>
<p>wait a minute wait a</p>
<p>minute wait a</p>
<p>minute yeah</p>
<p>charcoal is</p>
<p>one of the things you have to do you have to like</p>
<p>before you do anything you have to buy all this fucking</p>
<p>shit from gnc and one of the</p>
<p>things was charcoal</p>
<p>melt thistle</p>
<p>like all this bullshit</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know why i</p>
<p>guess i would show you so you don&rsquo;t die and i</p>
<p>think the charcoal maybe</p>
<p>absorbs shit</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t they make you do that for poison i</p>
<p>think for poison yeah</p>
<p>it absorbs stuff</p>
<p>i remember that for dogs when dogs eat something poison</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna make them eat a fucking briquette</p>
<p>whenever i&rsquo;m at the grill i</p>
<p>crack a little one and just pop it just in case like</p>
<p>5hdp you want to have it in your</p>
<p>system is that really good for you</p>
<p>brian i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like it i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it is</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t seem good for you what happened to</p>
<p>your what did you do with this cleanse</p>
<p>it pretty much made you lose weight</p>
<p>did you lose weight yeah</p>
<p>i was fucking</p>
<p>throwing up you&rsquo;re eating charcoal</p>
<p>no no you&rsquo;re just not eating anything except</p>
<p>lemon water</p>
<p>it was like 12 i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>shitting on the</p>
<p>lever and we&rsquo;re making dinner what people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand is that</p>
<p>completely fucks with your metabolism</p>
<p>but when you do something like that and you lose weight</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re just not eating anything</p>
<p>your metabolism</p>
<p>gets jacked and then when you eat things</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s harder to burn them all your body don&rsquo;t have as</p>
<p>much and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not gonna have it anymore so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it all it just</p>
<p>locks it all up</p>
<p>super lethargic</p>
<p>too but the beautiful</p>
<p>thing about that diet is</p>
<p>is that if you reintroduce food into your system</p>
<p>after 12 days you can find out allergies a lot more</p>
<p>accurately than</p>
<p>if say you just tried</p>
<p>might be afraid of rice or something</p>
<p>like you first start</p>
<p>off but people do it it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>doing it to find out if you have an</p>
<p>issue with people</p>
<p>no wait what it</p>
<p>does is it does</p>
<p>kind of it does</p>
<p>reset your system it resets</p>
<p>everything for you so then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re slowly introducing food back into your diet</p>
<p>so i think you</p>
<p>start off with rice</p>
<p>and you see and you immediately</p>
<p>could tell if</p>
<p>anything affects you with this rice and then you</p>
<p>bring in like you know whatever and then it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kinda cool for that way you analyze your diet</p>
<p>slowly yeah</p>
<p>and then you apologize on behalf of</p>
<p>all men on youtube that&rsquo;s the next step yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>i apologize</p>
<p>and immediately on</p>
<p>behalf of all men</p>
<p>for selfish behavior</p>
<p>please take me into your bosoms</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just so</p>
<p>ridiculous yeah what</p>

<p>hours or call</p>
<p>you have to google it we need to go i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna pretend</p>
<p>like i don&rsquo;t have that one up the top of my head</p>
<p>yeah but there is a site just for that</p>
<p>which is great</p>
<p>yeah i used</p>
<p>to work at gateway computers and the day that joe</p>
<p>called me up was like hey you</p>
<p>wanna move to</p>
<p>california and do</p>
<p>videos for a living and all this shit</p>
<p>i was like okay</p>
<p>and so i go</p>
<p>to my boss and i&rsquo;m like hey giving him a two</p>
<p>week notice he goes actually i need to talk to gateways</p>
<p>closing all their</p>
<p>stores i&rsquo;m like</p>

<p>really well</p>
<p>he was putting up these</p>
<p>funny videos</p>
<p>on my message</p>
<p>board and this is fuck man i was like</p>
<p>was it 200 was</p>
<p>free youtube i was just really good at concumc</p>
<p>compression</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all it took back in the day man i made shit</p>
<p>videos on the internet but i knew how to</p>
<p>access to servers from my internet provider that i</p>
<p>started so we just</p>
<p>streamed all sorts of shit on real player</p>
<p>and brian you know</p>
<p>comes off very strange</p>
<p>on the podcast sometimes and some people complain</p>
<p>about them but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the reason for that</p>
<p>is he&rsquo;s just very</p>
<p>weirdly creative he&rsquo;s a very odd guy</p>
<p>and these videos were fucking hilarious</p>
<p>we have to put them somewhere</p>
<p>some of them up somewhere</p>
<p>the one that you did were</p>
<p>you there was</p>
<p>a guy who this was</p>
<p>after he already moved here</p>
<p>who was giving him a hard time because this guy</p>
<p>was kind of jealous that he got this job working for me</p>
<p>so brian made this</p>
<p>video goofing on him that</p>
<p>yeah it was like</p>
<p>yeah he had a baby</p>
<p>he just recently had a baby he was</p>
<p>married to this girl that looked like</p>
<p>from the girl from</p>
<p>look like harry potter</p>
<p>and so i just made this pretty much</p>
<p>what two minute</p>
<p>video a minute and a half video that</p>
<p>that just was like oh you want to fight here</p>
<p>i was good at</p>
<p>flash animation at the time because when flash</p>
<p>first came out when it was like</p>
<p>shockwave instead of</p>
<p>shockwave is what it was called</p>
<p>macramedia shock</p>
<p>radio yeah they</p>
<p>loved my videos i did so</p>
<p>some person from adobe used to send me</p>
<p>flash like flash</p>
<p>10 20 like this really expensive software</p>
<p>no one had access to this because it was too expensive</p>
<p>so i used to</p>
<p>learn that shit back in the day so i had to make all</p>
<p>these flash videos</p>
<p>now i can&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>touch flash it&rsquo;s so fucking impossible</p>

<p>sequel somehow</p>
<p>so i don&rsquo;t know you</p>
<p>wanna hear something funny</p>
<p>something someone</p>
<p>wrote on twitter</p>
<p>about this conversation</p>
<p>he wrote consumerism with all</p>
<p>these exclamation points</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s ugly talk</p>
<p>about deeper shit you whores</p>
<p>oh what you know listen you dumb fuck</p>
<p>okay we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about fantastic</p>
<p>technology and the creation like</p>
<p>human innovation the creation of an m3 or</p>
<p>an apple laptop or anything</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>spectacular new</p>
<p>things that are in our</p>
<p>world right now it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>about consumerism</p>
<p>and getting</p>
<p>wrapped up in this whole</p>
<p>hey i&rsquo;m not into money man</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not into consumerism man</p>
<p>like just shut the fuck up okay how did he</p>
<p>how did he send that</p>
<p>tweet yeah did you not</p>
<p>yeah what is your</p>
<p>phone what is it computer stupid</p>
<p>yeah you live in a</p>
<p>house you dumb cunt</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d like to</p>
<p>see what it&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t care he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a piece of shit</p>
<p>i just want to address this</p>
<p>whole retarded</p>
<p>mentality to criticize</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s interests</p>
<p>especially other people&rsquo;s interest when it comes to</p>
<p>things that you can&rsquo;t attain</p>
<p>so all of a</p>
<p>sudden these</p>
<p>things that you can&rsquo;t attain become</p>
<p>evil things or bad</p>
<p>things or negative</p>
<p>things we all have fucking</p>
<p>transportation whether it&rsquo;s a bus</p>
<p>or whether you</p>
<p>drive your own fucking car</p>
<p>we all have</p>
<p>transportation okay no one</p>
<p>unless you are living</p>
<p>in a solar powered</p>
<p>house and you ride a fucking</p>
<p>horse everywhere</p>
<p>okay everyone&rsquo;s contributing nobody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s listening</p>
<p>to this broadcast</p>
<p>right now exactly who</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>access to something you got a carbon footprint</p>
<p>motherfucker all</p>
<p>right and this idea that</p>
<p>somehow or another like looking into this</p>
<p>technology and</p>
<p>objects and things</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not being obsessed with create or</p>
<p>acquiring diamonds and walking around and</p>
<p>covered in jewels that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not what we&rsquo;re doing what we&rsquo;re doing is looking at</p>
<p>the incredible shit that</p>
<p>human beings are creating</p>
<p>and how nuts this is and</p>
<p>how different this is in just a few years ago that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>all right you</p>
<p>stupid fucks</p>
<p>it makes me it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>trolled man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a mentality</p>
<p>that comes up over and over and over</p>
<p>again and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mostly a justification of failure</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a justification of either the lack of ambition or</p>
<p>their lack of participating in some sort of</p>
<p>a materialism quest</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>in the game at all so they criticize the game you know</p>
<p>i give a fuck</p>
<p>when i see there&rsquo;s a guy in the hamptons it&rsquo;s got some</p>
<p>180 million dollar</p>
<p>house it&rsquo;s the most expensive</p>
<p>house ever and it&rsquo;s gigantic</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>fuck that guy</p>
<p>that fucking</p>
<p>capitalist i go wow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible like that guy went for it you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i think</p>
<p>now here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>maybe that guy</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t subscribe to the game</p>
<p>maybe he is capable</p>
<p>of playing this game</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s on twitter</p>
<p>criticizing you so</p>
<p>again unless he you sent a</p>
<p>carrier pigeon</p>
<p>to deliver that fucking message</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s playing</p>
<p>the game somehow exactly he&rsquo;s just not playing the game</p>
<p>using a fucking computer</p>
<p>you know look we&rsquo;re all a part of this weird</p>
<p>thing called capitalism</p>
<p>or this weird</p>
<p>thing which</p>
<p>capitalism is just sort of an operating</p>
<p>system that</p>
<p>runs society i mean that&rsquo;s really what it is</p>
<p>yeah and i might</p>
<p>like apple better and you</p>
<p>might like windows better they&rsquo;re all operating</p>
<p>systems we&rsquo;re also</p>
<p>clicking the</p>
<p>same damn icon</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t believe that</p>
<p>capitalism is perfect by</p>
<p>any stretch of the imagination nor</p>
<p>do i believe as communism works</p>
<p>i think socialism is a</p>
<p>ridiculous idea because it goes</p>
<p>completely against</p>
<p>human nature</p>
<p>and when you start</p>
<p>criticizing people for</p>
<p>things that they&rsquo;ve acquired</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dumb</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s things out there that are amazing</p>
<p>a big screen</p>
<p>television is amazing</p>
<p>brian&rsquo;s got 3d tv in his bedroom that shit&rsquo;s</p>
<p>amazing oh that was a mis purchase let&rsquo;s be honest</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way no no no</p>
<p>no here you</p>
<p>wanna have your</p>
<p>throws hold on</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna roll my</p>
<p>sleeves up step back here&rsquo;s my conversation</p>

<p>i found the tv i wanted</p>
<p>it also had 3d</p>
<p>hot no no just a normal tv</p>
<p>and i was gonna get it then i</p>
<p>checked on my</p>
<p>amazon i&rsquo;m like how much is this tv and they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t like the tv on there was pretty much the same</p>
<p>but then they were like they had the 3d version for 100</p>
<p>more i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>fuck that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna get the 3d version for 100</p>
<p>more so i ordered on the amazon got the tv</p>
<p>right then you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never spend</p>
<p>then you get to</p>
<p>spend an extra 150</p>
<p>per pair of goggles then you get to</p>
<p>spend an extra 100</p>
<p>bucks a month or whatever for the special</p>
<p>receiver that can</p>
<p>deliver that amazon had this</p>
<p>had a deal if you bought it it</p>

<p>or at best buy</p>
<p>we went to see and they had</p>
<p>monsters and</p>
<p>aliens playing</p>
<p>i think it might be</p>
<p>worth it just to</p>
<p>watch that movie</p>
<p>dude tronch</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only</p>
<p>movie like when hd</p>
<p>first came out people were like dude you</p>
<p>gotta get hd</p>
<p>why you can</p>
<p>watch flamingos fuck</p>
<p>and the sun rise and high</p>
<p>death and that&rsquo;s all there was for it</p>
<p>which i get you know your eyes widening</p>
<p>cause you like</p>
<p>watching flamingos fuck</p>
<p>but after three</p>
<p>months that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all there was have you played call of duty in 3d</p>
<p>i have played 3d games yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cool the on</p>
<p>screen display</p>
<p>is a little further out in</p>
<p>front of your face you still wear</p>
<p>glasses you</p>
<p>still get a fucking headache you</p>
<p>play online</p>
<p>i play call of duty</p>
<p>gives you a headache for some people at</p>
<p>first at first the</p>
<p>first 10 minutes</p>
<p>you have your eyes then you rewire your</p>
<p>brain to go</p>
<p>cross eyed without</p>
<p>giving a headache</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re totally gold</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>crazy is this new nintendo 3ds</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;m watching kids</p>
<p>holding up their 3ds right to</p>
<p>their face with this 3d shit and they&rsquo;ve already</p>
<p>admitted it in</p>
<p>japan that or dr drew</p>
<p>admitted that that could</p>
<p>cause your eyes to bleed</p>
<p>and like people are already getting</p>
<p>fucked up from it and you know how kids are with</p>
<p>their fucking game boys they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna put it in their face</p>
<p>hours on end</p>
<p>smash who knows what this is</p>
<p>gonna do to</p>
<p>their fucking eyes man you&rsquo;re gonna get</p>
<p>bluetooth or some fucking shit at the airport dude</p>
<p>but no no i don&rsquo;t recommend 3d tv</p>
<p>augmented reality though</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that shit</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>would you be able to in the very near future</p>
<p>you know google goggles have you</p>
<p>heard of google goggles yes</p>
<p>amazing so you</p>
<p>point it you</p>
<p>point google goggles at a restaurant or a landmark</p>
<p>and it analyzes what you&rsquo;re looking at and then spin</p>
<p>gets you out a</p>
<p>search result</p>
<p>based off that so you</p>
<p>point at the golden gate bridge oh yeah</p>
<p>the history</p>
<p>that yeah so</p>
<p>extrapolate</p>
<p>from that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy right now for augmented reality stop and</p>
<p>think about that for a second the</p>
<p>translation went up</p>
<p>think about that you</p>
<p>can take a photo of a</p>
<p>building and tells you what the</p>
<p>building is oh yeah</p>
<p>yeah you could create a message</p>
<p>board off of just that</p>
<p>photo it could</p>
<p>translate text in real time you</p>
<p>could have a</p>
<p>check in you</p>
<p>could have a menu</p>
<p>pop out of a coaster that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be a contact</p>
<p>lens at one point</p>
<p>right so well that&rsquo;s yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shifting 20 or</p>
<p>what but so that is step one</p>
<p>so step two is they have these</p>
<p>augmented reality markers that you can</p>
<p>throw down and look at with a webcam or with a cell</p>
<p>phone application</p>
<p>and it will</p>
<p>make like on the 3ds it makes like a dragon appear</p>
<p>and you can walk around and look at it in 3d and shoot</p>
<p>arrows at it that&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>now the next</p>
<p>phase of that is doing that without markers</p>
<p>so imagine this</p>
<p>and i know some people that are working on this</p>
<p>right now and i&rsquo;m trying to get into space</p>
<p>you launch the app on your cell</p>
<p>phone you look around and it analyzes in real time</p>
<p>in the cloud</p>
<p>it looks at this</p>
<p>table and goes all</p>
<p>right there&rsquo;s a coconut water</p>
<p>nutritional info do you want to purchase by now</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a wine</p>
<p>bottle oh i know what vintage that is from the</p>
<p>fucking thing you can look at the</p>
<p>microphone and tap it there&rsquo;s information on it</p>
<p>everything that the</p>
<p>barrier between internet and real life is</p>
<p>visual rapidly</p>
<p>dissipated that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the next step and it&rsquo;s yeah but it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>gonna have real time</p>
<p>tracking too so imagine hiking up to a</p>
<p>point at a mountain</p>
<p>looking over</p>
<p>a city and tapping it and having information on</p>
<p>that city come out having a communal game pop out of it</p>
<p>all that shit&rsquo;s happening that&rsquo;s incredible that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be awesome i love</p>
<p>technology and it&rsquo;s happening now</p>
<p>so fuck you</p>
<p>anti consumerism twitter dick yeah fuck that guy</p>

<p>fucking shit in the line</p>
<p>i know a lot of cops but with that respect</p>
<p>for cops the notion of not being able to film them</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re performing</p>

<p>woman comes</p>
<p>along and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pulling the girl away</p>
<p>and she pulls him away she grabs a hold of him</p>
<p>and he turns around and</p>
<p>blasts her right in the face</p>
<p>and then you know</p>

<p>me keep exploring</p>
<p>you gotta look it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gushers must buy and it&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>young kid on his webcam and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>where are the fucking</p>
<p>parents man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>where are the fucking parents</p>
<p>christy alley just</p>
<p>never got over diane i</p>
<p>think is that what it is yeah</p>
<p>yeah man shit happens dude</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a problem when you&rsquo;re in a reality or</p>
<p>a big hit sitcom</p>
<p>or do you ever</p>
<p>ever have a weight</p>
<p>issue being in</p>
<p>front of camera like being</p>
<p>on camera did it ever get to you and like you have</p>
<p>to look a certain way or feel a certain way to be no</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m fatter now than i&rsquo;ve ever been in my life</p>
<p>for sure i could see it in my</p>
<p>fat face and i</p>
<p>could see it in my gut like i can i can</p>
<p>pinch i can pinch</p>
<p>fat around me it&rsquo;s really because i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>traveling a lot and i hurt my back</p>
<p>i popped what&rsquo;s called a rib head</p>
<p>a rib head is a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what connects like</p>
<p>some shit on your back anyway</p>
<p>point is when i did it i couldn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>jiu jitsu for like two months</p>
<p>and i didn&rsquo;t lift</p>
<p>heavy for two</p>
<p>months either</p>
<p>all i did was just hit the bag</p>
<p>and i didn&rsquo;t even do that all that consistently</p>
<p>so i tried to let myself heal up and in the process i</p>
<p>ate just like i always do isn&rsquo;t that the</p>
<p>bitch of it yeah like you</p>
<p>you kick your eyes off the</p>
<p>prize one second and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gone yeah it&rsquo;s gone and muscle memories bullshit</p>
<p>but fortunately for me no it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s totally</p>
<p>real but not when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in that two weeks recovering from an injury or</p>
<p>something else like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing worse</p>
<p>yeah injuries are brutal</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s part of the game my</p>
<p>whole back is fucked up and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>still training through</p>
<p>it like an asshole really i need to go get it looked at</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s wrong with your back</p>
<p>great question</p>
<p>yeah when you say</p>
<p>training like what are you doing i</p>
<p>started recently getting into weightlifting</p>
<p>yeah yeah just</p>
<p>heavy weightlifting i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never been in</p>
<p>shape my entire life kettlebells yeah i did</p>
<p>was that kettlebells no</p>
<p>no just traditional</p>
<p>teach you the ways of kettlebells son</p>
<p>but i teach you the ways of men i did one of</p>
<p>those 23andme tests</p>
<p>where you spit in the vial and they analyze your dna</p>
<p>and tell you what your</p>
<p>predispositions are</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>and it was like</p>
<p>morbid obesity</p>
<p>was 999 percent</p>
<p>repeating whoa</p>
<p>and that was like a</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a genetic issue yeah</p>
<p>well i mean</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m predisposed to it obviously</p>
<p>predisposed</p>
<p>to more but obesity but looky you&rsquo;re so lean but</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m kind of the only one</p>
<p>in my family that is though and i kind of developed a</p>
<p>neuroses about it at one</p>
<p>point i&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>worked out so much i</p>
<p>never had to</p>
<p>worry about my weight on tv</p>
<p>but you know that idea that</p>
<p>it puts 10 pounds on you that&rsquo;s complete</p>
<p>total horseshit that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>fat girls who don&rsquo;t know what they really look like</p>
<p>and they see themselves on camera oh my</p>
<p>god have you</p>
<p>ever have you ever seen a</p>
<p>standard death</p>
<p>a standard death</p>
<p>stream stretched out on an hdtv</p>
<p>that will put down</p>
<p>that will fuck you</p>
<p>up real fast that&rsquo;s like a heart</p>
<p>video but in reverse</p>
<p>you remember</p>
<p>those videos</p>
<p>heart remember this is the</p>
<p>first time they</p>
<p>experimented like how do we get this fat</p>
<p>bitch to look hot</p>
<p>we gotta fucking</p>
<p>we gotta distort her</p>
<p>frame and make</p>
<p>it look like we&rsquo;re looking at her through like</p>
<p>alice in wonderland</p>
<p>seeing eyeglasses i saw a demo of software now that</p>
<p>for actually you don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>tracking markers or any</p>
<p>green screen bullshit but you film an actor doing</p>
<p>their performance like you normally</p>
<p>would and it</p>
<p>kinda does an xbox connect</p>
<p>style analysis of</p>
<p>their frame and</p>
<p>builds a skeleton</p>
<p>and then does</p>
<p>pixel detection</p>
<p>to see where they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>i call them</p>
<p>renaissance fair arms</p>
<p>where the turkey leg hangs</p>
<p>right it sees where the</p>
<p>ren fair arms</p>
<p>ends right and</p>
<p>where the scenery</p>
<p>begins and you can real time dynamically</p>
<p>slide how fat thin tall or</p>
<p>short a person is</p>
<p>and it will re</p>
<p>render the video</p>
<p>to make actors seem bulkier</p>
<p>to make them seem thinner so</p>
<p>whatever there&rsquo;s demos of it on youtube</p>
<p>right well that 300</p>
<p>shit what they did with 300</p>
<p>i mean a lot of people they showed the 300 workout</p>
<p>this is what they did to get in such amazing shape</p>
<p>no they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do you know what kind of a fucking diet you</p>
<p>would have to be on and how long you</p>
<p>would have to be on it and how consistent you</p>
<p>would have to be</p>
<p>the best shape</p>
<p>of your life</p>
<p>it would take years</p>
<p>and years of hard</p>
<p>training to</p>
<p>reach like wow</p>
<p>gerald what is the name gerald butler gerard</p>
<p>butler gerard butler</p>
<p>which if you see him now who did like</p>
<p>snl recently he&rsquo;s fat</p>
<p>dopey and soft</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s totally i</p>
<p>showed my girlfriend that i was like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what that ends up like</p>
<p>what spartan looks like he actually got in</p>
<p>shape for that</p>
<p>movie i&rsquo;m sure no</p>
<p>he did and they</p>
<p>added all that</p>
<p>other cgi shit</p>
<p>to him to make him look better than he really did but</p>
<p>shit shit that guy i&rsquo;m not into him man i</p>
<p>fucking loved him in that</p>
<p>movie i haven&rsquo;t seen it yet</p>
<p>i loved him in that</p>
<p>movie and then</p>
<p>everything i&rsquo;ve seen in him</p>
<p>since then i&rsquo;m like god man why are you</p>
<p>annoying me</p>

<p>first movie i saw her in what was that what was her big</p>
<p>movie the fucking</p>
<p>movie with seth rogen</p>
<p>she was oh that was a</p>
<p>i liked her</p>
<p>maybe i liked her because she was fucking a fat guy</p>
<p>i was like oh that&rsquo;s really sweet</p>
<p>fuck that guy and then</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>never really</p>
<p>got a shit together and did read the baby books and</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s kind of hot and cool and</p>
<p>at the end that one</p>
<p>night stand</p>
<p>slash pregnancy totally worked out</p>
<p>yeah knocked out</p>
<p>beautiful that&rsquo;s how it works</p>
<p>you know that</p>
<p>um that other one that she did recently with</p>
<p>josh duhamel</p>
<p>that was his name is</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not gonna feel</p>
<p>the guy from vegas</p>
<p>the guy from</p>
<p>vegas very nice guy i did an episode of</p>
<p>vegas he&rsquo;s cool as fuck</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the one who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>married to fergie</p>
<p>from the black eyed peas</p>
<p>okay anyway</p>
<p>he did some</p>
<p>movie with her and it looks so i didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>watch it i just</p>
<p>watched it on tv</p>
<p>on the movie on the</p>
<p>screen on a plane</p>
<p>i watched on a plane</p>
<p>while i was writing</p>
<p>and i would look up and get angry</p>
<p>angry i get</p>
<p>angry to help my writing</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m listening to fucking hendrix</p>
<p>i would look up at this</p>
<p>stupid shit</p>
<p>and all these</p>
<p>slack jawed business face douchebags</p>
<p>watching this</p>
<p>stupid ass fucking</p>
<p>movie when you know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen like there&rsquo;s not a goddamn</p>
<p>shocker in this</p>
<p>movie it was no</p>
<p>devil wears prada</p>
<p>i always accidentally</p>
<p>watched the porn version of that movie</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m always with a girl and they&rsquo;re like oh my god</p>
<p>devil&rsquo;s wear prada</p>
<p>and then we turn it on</p>
<p>devil&rsquo;s wear nada</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s on like</p>
<p>every day and it&rsquo;s always the same on what what channel</p>
<p>showtime showtime</p>
<p>always watching that i love that i had an oh man</p>
<p>i was so close to doing one of</p>
<p>those i had an offer to be in one that was</p>
<p>a porn yeah it was like softcore cinemax whatever</p>
<p>and i was gonna play like brad</p>
<p>like the camera guy who gets decapitated in an attic</p>
<p>after getting blown</p>
<p>and i so wanted to do it and just did not pan out</p>
<p>a girl that i dated</p>
<p>a long time ago i saw her once</p>
<p>in one of those</p>
<p>so i was on another date</p>
<p>i was at this</p>
<p>chick&rsquo;s house i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>flipping through the channels</p>
<p>and all of a</p>
<p>sudden out of nowhere like a</p>
<p>girl i did like a year before that was on this fucking</p>
<p>this softcore porn</p>
<p>movie it was like so cheesy and so bad</p>
<p>it was so stupid</p>
<p>it was but it was</p>
<p>weird you know</p>
<p>what was the setting was it</p>
<p>tennis instructor</p>
<p>i barely remember</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going way back more than 10 years ago</p>
<p>it was probably like</p>
<p>96 or something did</p>
<p>you finish i just</p>
<p>moved to la</p>
<p>so like i didn&rsquo;t it was too it was a much bigger</p>
<p>much bigger</p>
<p>shock to me</p>
<p>because like just knowing someone and seeing them on</p>
<p>television like</p>
<p>being around</p>
<p>famous people when you</p>
<p>first you know like</p>
<p>moved to hollywood it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>weirdest thing like you don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>expect them to be real</p>
<p>you think they&rsquo;re like holograms and</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>then when you meet someone in real life then all of a</p>
<p>sudden they&rsquo;re on television</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>still fucking</p>
<p>weirds me out man</p>
<p>now i&rsquo;m getting used to it i&rsquo;m pretty used to it now</p>
<p>but back then i was really and it was a girl you dated</p>
<p>then all of a</p>
<p>sudden you&rsquo;re seeing her in some fucking</p>
<p>stupid movie or she&rsquo;s making out with some guy</p>
<p>she was a girl that was in a show called</p>
<p>hardball with me</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s it i just saw</p>
<p>a preview for hardball the</p>
<p>other day it&rsquo;s just confused</p>
<p>two stories</p>
<p>just confused</p>
<p>two stories</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another one this is another</p>
<p>girl from hardball is not a girl</p>
<p>that i didn&rsquo;t i&rsquo;m like i didn&rsquo;t date that girl</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t date that girl it&rsquo;s a different</p>
<p>girl but that was another girl that i also saw</p>
<p>around the same time also in a soft car</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m still waiting to come across like on a</p>
<p>euges or a red tube or something like that i&rsquo;m waiting</p>
<p>to come across</p>
<p>something in x</p>
<p>and fucking high</p>
<p>school i know you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never had this</p>
<p>bound to happen</p>
<p>i know me too they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>playing the numbers</p>
<p>game and believe me i</p>
<p>watch enough to try to get through that</p>
<p>every day still not</p>
<p>found it imagine if you didn&rsquo;t notice and you were like</p>
<p>cause like sometimes like you know when if someone</p>
<p>especially as time goes on</p>
<p>like ten years ago you forget people</p>
<p>you forget people you forget</p>
<p>you forget everything</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re beating off</p>
<p>and then like halfway in the middle of the</p>
<p>video like i fucked her real life</p>
<p>oh my god why did</p>
<p>she let me do that to her back then i had a blab</p>
<p>yeah yeah your asshole&rsquo;s sore</p>
<p>no wonder it&rsquo;s sore</p>
<p>now i know why</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just happy that that</p>
<p>when i used to</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s been a couple times</p>
<p>where i fucked on camera before</p>
<p>and it was back when like webcams</p>
<p>first came out</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>happy that that didn&rsquo;t that so it got on the internet</p>
<p>you fucked on the internet like</p>
<p>twice well that fucking what about that</p>
<p>thing man that can</p>
<p>and go back in time and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>record that</p>
<p>imagine if it</p>
<p>could though</p>
<p>why that&rsquo;s not outside</p>
<p>the realm of possibility i was just</p>
<p>drunk and i&rsquo;m like did you</p>
<p>watch this you imagine if</p>
<p>streaming was</p>
<p>all recorded somewhere because it&rsquo;s really just one</p>
<p>zero is going through a fucking computer if they</p>
<p>figure out how</p>
<p>to go back in time and</p>
<p>look reprocess your</p>
<p>fbi absolutely</p>
<p>have machines that are taking all the</p>
<p>copies of ones</p>
<p>and zeros that are spitting through the internet</p>
<p>right now so</p>
<p>right now data centers at at amp</p>
<p>t and little garden all that shit</p>
<p>they have machines that are</p>
<p>mirroring all that</p>
<p>damn machines that are i bet</p>
<p>this is true this is not</p>
<p>conspiracy theory</p>
<p>would you think</p>
<p>would you think</p>
<p>absolutely your documented proof</p>
<p>would you think like</p>
<p>15 years ago they were doing that too though like</p>
<p>not to that</p>
<p>level but where do you</p>
<p>think that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be</p>
<p>technology to go back and somehow you know</p>
<p>get that somehow</p>
<p>that could be amazing</p>
<p>yeah i mean i don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>i believe from</p>
<p>here on out whatever here is not this year or not</p>
<p>today but there has been there was a turning</p>
<p>point from that</p>
<p>point on all</p>
<p>those ones and zeros</p>
<p>exist somewhere</p>
<p>absolutely do yeah</p>
<p>well the really</p>
<p>crazy idea is that at one</p>
<p>point in time there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be some sort of a computer that&rsquo;s so fucking</p>
<p>powerful and that</p>
<p>computing power and</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s capable</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re capable of extrapolating from any</p>
<p>given circumstance</p>
<p>is that what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be able to do is see the</p>
<p>world in every aspect like</p>
<p>every single</p>
<p>thing about the</p>
<p>world today</p>
<p>and literally</p>
<p>put into a computer how did this get into</p>
<p>place how did this get into</p>
<p>place in relationship with that and go back in time</p>
<p>and literally</p>
<p>be able to recreate the entire</p>
<p>model of life on this planet</p>
<p>and life in the universe</p>
<p>everything from the very beginning to end</p>
<p>until they get back to</p>
<p>jesus creating it</p>
<p>which is only</p>
<p>ironically a few thousand years ago it&rsquo;s that easy</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have to go back very</p>
<p>slow six grand</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>already figured out how to record memories</p>
<p>right they can really</p>
<p>they believe they can</p>
<p>put people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>heads and devices and record those</p>
<p>electrical impulses and see</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going off in the</p>
<p>brains and then glean</p>
<p>the ones and zero data from that</p>
<p>right so i did not know this</p>
<p>how can you transfer it from you to me</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still working on</p>
<p>they know how to record it</p>
<p>they can gather that data</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s putting that data back into somebody that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>issue so imagine a near future</p>
<p>where you put on a cap</p>
<p>or you have your johnny</p>
<p>mnemonic neural implant and you go</p>
<p>i want to go skydiving</p>
<p>today double</p>
<p>click and you pay 4 99 for that adventure</p>
<p>and it plays back somebody&rsquo;s memory that was recorded</p>
<p>of them free falling</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s up what&rsquo;s up</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember what you know the one julia yes</p>
<p>that was all</p>
<p>about that where they</p>
<p>put in memories</p>
<p>strange no yeah</p>
<p>strange something okay</p>
<p>yeah remember it&rsquo;s like a man</p>
<p>like yeah i thought</p>
<p>i never remember johnny mnemonic</p>
<p>which was a</p>
<p>great shot of</p>
<p>netflix someone someone on</p>
<p>twitter i&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>knows what the fuck this is come on</p>
<p>it was weird</p>
<p>the whole the</p>
<p>whole idea of the</p>
<p>movie was that that that&rsquo;s what you do you</p>
<p>would like put memories in</p>
<p>your head and</p>
<p>stuff like that well they can already record them</p>
<p>now the issue is playback so once they have that down</p>
<p>imagine an app</p>
<p>store for experiences</p>
<p>well you know i thought</p>
<p>about that the</p>
<p>other day when i was looking at my iphone strange</p>
<p>days strange days</p>
<p>knuckles bam powerful</p>
<p>i was looking at my iphone and it was</p>
<p>something that my</p>
<p>daughter did that was hilarious and i was</p>
<p>watching and i was like okay this happened</p>
<p>you know it happened five minutes ago now i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>watching on this</p>
<p>video it&rsquo;s so simple and so easy like</p>
<p>this is seriously like a time capture yeah</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s some it&rsquo;s a very remedial</p>
<p>rudimentary form of time capture so imagine all the</p>
<p>senses we have</p>
<p>right all the</p>
<p>stuff that we can perceive that this</p>
<p>thing just captures a 2d</p>
<p>image of right yeah so imagine</p>
<p>infrared with sonar with feeling sent</p>
<p>with feeling potentially</p>
<p>right so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna capture</p>
<p>scenes but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna capture</p>
<p>every aspect of a</p>
<p>scene so that when you</p>
<p>wanna play it back</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be just like you&rsquo;re living in that moment</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll tap into all those</p>
<p>senses you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done the isolation tank i have yeah you&rsquo;ve done it</p>
<p>at the same place the</p>
<p>float lab in venice</p>
<p>and because we were talking</p>
<p>about crash the mad scientist down there that creates</p>
<p>these fucking things but</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s working on that</p>
<p>whole screen</p>
<p>setup you know</p>
<p>about all that</p>
<p>right yeah what do you</p>
<p>think about all that no it&rsquo;s flat concept i</p>
<p>agree with it in theory</p>
<p>for those who don&rsquo;t know the idea is that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>floating in an isolation tank so you&rsquo;re isolated from</p>
<p>light sound</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where your skin ends and</p>
<p>where the warm body temperature</p>
<p>water begins</p>
<p>and because of that your body and your</p>
<p>senses are zeroed out</p>
<p>right so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>completely open to everything</p>
<p>and the idea is that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be an lcd</p>
<p>screen in front of you that&rsquo;s projecting</p>
<p>the perfect golf</p>
<p>swing or projecting how to</p>
<p>function like</p>
<p>rocco or how to</p>
<p>drive a race car like andretti</p>
<p>you went rocco dude you went 90s</p>
<p>rocco animal freddy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>classic that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>classic he&rsquo;s not even</p>
<p>dirty anymore</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s still a</p>
<p>classic he tapped out when he did too</p>
<p>the point is</p>
<p>his notion is that you&rsquo;ll be able to</p>
<p>watch that in a dept tank</p>
<p>and because</p>
<p>your brain is so in</p>
<p>tuned and open to all</p>
<p>these memories</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna flood</p>
<p>right in the problem is that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a pure</p>
<p>input method to the</p>
<p>brain you&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>aware in that moment that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching an lcd</p>
<p>screen there&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>light beaming into your eyes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll defeat the</p>
<p>whole purpose</p>
<p>of sensory deprivation yes and no</p>
<p>but it also</p>
<p>instead of just</p>
<p>sensory deprivation it minimizes the sensory</p>
<p>input and allows you to have more</p>
<p>mental resources to concentrate on the</p>
<p>video that is true</p>
<p>now that&rsquo;ll give so if you</p>
<p>wanna watch</p>
<p>documentaries</p>
<p>yeah if you want</p>
<p>to numb your</p>
<p>senses and just be</p>
<p>focused into one</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to somehow reprogram your</p>
<p>brain that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pitched to me that</p>
<p>it will change your</p>
<p>brain to do that it</p>
<p>might make you more</p>
<p>aware of something that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>i think it allows your</p>
<p>brain to use more resources</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>brian i mean i&rsquo;m not necessarily willing to</p>
<p>i mean look i&rsquo;m a huge proponent of nothing</p>
<p>of the sensory deprivation tank in and of itself being</p>
<p>emptiness nothing nothing there i don&rsquo;t want any</p>
<p>input at all i want no hearing no seeing no</p>
<p>touching i want to</p>
<p>untether my body from my mind visually</p>
<p>physically in</p>
<p>every single</p>
<p>way and that&rsquo;s you know that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m all</p>
<p>about with the isolation tank</p>
<p>experience but i&rsquo;m willing to listen</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m willing to like</p>
<p>it might be</p>
<p>maybe maybe i&rsquo;ll try</p>
<p>here so it just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t sound</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t you know i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>fully on board for that vision i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>down i&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>wrap that thing in</p>
<p>tinfoil because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still 3g signals and</p>
<p>wi fi hitting your body in there yeah you&rsquo;re gonna die</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not down with this little</p>
<p>screen well i&rsquo;m down with doing it in some sort of a</p>
<p>large circular thing</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s much much larger what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking of is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the center</p>
<p>almost like in like a</p>
<p>giant circular</p>
<p>pod and above you</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a screen sort of like</p>
<p>an imac screen</p>
<p>and that is the</p>
<p>input and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>large and circular and when</p>
<p>like say if you have some sort of a</p>
<p>video on space</p>
<p>it literally</p>
<p>would become the</p>
<p>whole sky right</p>
<p>you know that i</p>
<p>think is possible and that&rsquo;s very fascinating to</p>
<p>me i&rsquo;m waiting for someone to create</p>
<p>technology that beams the</p>
<p>image into your eye</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s the only way you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna really be able to fully</p>
<p>flood someone&rsquo;s periphery</p>
<p>right is to beam it in there so imagine like so you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t see your own nose you don&rsquo;t see anything right so</p>
<p>imagine a projector that&rsquo;s locked in that</p>
<p>can quickly and dynamically response to your eyes</p>
<p>maybe moving around or shifting</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s adjusting focal</p>
<p>levels beaming</p>
<p>image a and image b</p>
<p>into your eye giving you that shutter effect</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to</p>
<p>completely zone</p>
<p>out on something and your periphery</p>
<p>would be flooded</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>get in on the ground</p>
<p>floor of that one</p>
<p>yeah you don&rsquo;t want to be fucking blind</p>
<p>the nintendo 3ds you don&rsquo;t want the</p>
<p>first you want</p>
<p>to like see what happens</p>
<p>in six months like the</p>
<p>first dudes who</p>
<p>tried wi fi or the</p>
<p>first dudes who</p>
<p>tried or like microwaves</p>
<p>yes i was just trying to make a salisbury</p>
<p>steak now i have a vagina</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s weird lasix lasik</p>
<p>surgery the</p>
<p>first guys to get in there and get</p>
<p>their eyeballs cut open</p>
<p>you know yikes</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t always work</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pretty</p>
<p>goddamn good now now they do it in like it&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>seconds right and you get a</p>
<p>video of it you get like a souvenir photo</p>
<p>like like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>splash mountain</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s where we</p>
<p>lasered your eyeball jesus</p>
<p>we corrupted</p>
<p>the lens right</p>
<p>how many how did they figure that out man</p>
<p>how many people did they have to practice on before</p>
<p>they got that technique down they use cadaver eyeballs</p>
<p>probably goats eyeballs and shit yeah</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s yeah what&rsquo;s the closest to</p>
<p>human eyeballs in an animal</p>
<p>i think pig</p>
<p>what if you</p>
<p>could transfer pig eyes to people</p>
<p>well they&rsquo;ve already got now</p>
<p>again it harkens back to</p>
<p>transhumanism where</p>
<p>they can let</p>
<p>blind people see</p>
<p>rough shapes and hard edges with light</p>
<p>you go five years from now they&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>same site that we do you go ten years from now they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have infrared</p>
<p>heat vision for</p>
<p>all that stuff</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a matter of</p>
<p>time because then it&rsquo;s just a lens as long as they can</p>
<p>beam it right into your brain</p>
<p>contemplate</p>
<p>like where this is all headed</p>
<p>when you look at this whole</p>
<p>transhumanism</p>
<p>thing you say well what happens</p>
<p>if everybody lives forever what happens if there is no</p>
<p>death i mean what happens and what</p>
<p>about the resources man</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re already at max you know we&rsquo;re already</p>
<p>are we though</p>
<p>are we really at</p>
<p>max we&rsquo;re not really we kind of exaggerate that right</p>
<p>well we say we&rsquo;re at max</p>
<p>based off future projections</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;re not at max like tomorrow we&rsquo;re fucked</p>
<p>we know at the current rate</p>
<p>with babies being born and ozone depleted and</p>
<p>so much oil in the ground</p>
<p>we know that in 15 20 25 years</p>
<p>we might be</p>
<p>fucked so that&rsquo;s why we need to investigate it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>i mean how much of our energy is projected</p>
<p>and used towards making food</p>
<p>and how much of it is towards</p>
<p>fucking war and politics and nonsense and how the ways</p>
<p>we manufacture</p>
<p>food right now are making us sicker and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole</p>
<p>thing there but regarding</p>
<p>transhumanism</p>
<p>in 15 20 years from now we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be alive</p>
<p>for debates</p>
<p>that would be</p>
<p>previously unheard of</p>
<p>should someone with a</p>
<p>cybernetic implant</p>
<p>be allowed to run in the olympics or run</p>
<p>for office or</p>
<p>should your kid go to the same elementary</p>
<p>school when he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>infrared vision and that helps him with kickball</p>
<p>like that we don&rsquo;t know i have</p>
<p>these conversations with people when it comes to the</p>
<p>ufc when they</p>
<p>start talking</p>
<p>about how do you feel about</p>
<p>banned substances</p>
<p>because so many people keep getting busted</p>
<p>tiago silva just got busted for turning in non</p>
<p>human urine</p>
<p>because apparently he</p>
<p>yeah no way</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not a human he</p>
<p>took something</p>
<p>for his back because he hurt his back but he looked</p>
<p>fucking swole</p>
<p>in his last</p>
<p>fight and he was</p>
<p>super aggressive</p>
<p>to its roles on one podcast whoa</p>
<p>dog there&rsquo;s four crazy</p>
<p>new clothing line that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>yeah swole it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a cock it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>from gaydemon com what i do is i just take the the best</p>
<p>gay cock picture</p>
<p>dude that&rsquo;s what you need a rip deep v neck</p>
<p>with like a silhouette</p>
<p>giant cock coming out of the</p>
<p>waist like i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>thinking i need</p>
<p>that too and i&rsquo;m so glad somebody confirmed</p>
<p>you just gesture to it that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>the fuck was i</p>
<p>saying before we got in this i don&rsquo;t know but i&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>into my bladder what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>up good enough</p>
<p>what we just saying</p>
<p>uh gay demons</p>
<p>oh banned substances</p>
<p>sorry what dragons</p>
<p>fucking cars yeah it didn&rsquo;t pull up man oh here it goes</p>
<p>one of the um</p>
<p>what banned substances anyway</p>
<p>what i was saying</p>
<p>is that what people have to realize is look at this</p>
<p>dragon fucking a barracuda that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>first one i&rsquo;ve tuned into</p>
<p>see now that&rsquo;s pretty sweet</p>
<p>dragon&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>car start too</p>
<p>look at that pink cock</p>
<p>going in that muscle</p>
<p>so weird man that is</p>
<p>weird that&rsquo;s really fucking</p>
<p>weird whoever put</p>
<p>those two together i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>people are strange man but</p>
<p>what i was saying</p>
<p>about substances</p>
<p>is what we&rsquo;re dealing with now is fairly simple</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re dealing with people putting</p>
<p>chemicals in</p>
<p>their bodies</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re dealing with people</p>
<p>like did you take steroids did you take growth hormone</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t even test for growth hormone</p>
<p>yet they can test for testosterone they can test for</p>
<p>a bunch of different types of steroids that all work</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a reason why</p>
<p>barry bonds got better as he got older</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a reason why</p>
<p>roger clemens got better</p>
<p>stayed good as he got</p>
<p>older there&rsquo;s a reason why</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>these athletes that are well into</p>
<p>their 40s that are competing and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s chemicals</p>
<p>and what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>basically doing is</p>
<p>a low level form of genetic engineering</p>
<p>and what they&rsquo;re supposed to tell you is that well</p>
<p>depending on what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking at whether you&rsquo;re looking at old people</p>
<p>who are doing it hormone replacement therapy a lot of</p>
<p>people have different takes on that and they say well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>because what they&rsquo;re doing is just</p>
<p>allowing their body to operate as if a</p>
<p>young body did</p>
<p>and allows them to continue to compete</p>
<p>that way you get to see</p>
<p>you know guys play baseball well into</p>
<p>their 40s and do well</p>
<p>but then you get</p>
<p>guys who are like okay well this guy&rsquo;s taking</p>
<p>you know epo</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>twice as much red</p>
<p>blood cells as the average</p>
<p>person and he has incredible endurance because of that</p>
<p>and then this guy&rsquo;s taking</p>
<p>you know antivar and he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>amazing muscle density and he&rsquo;s a fucking anime</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting to</p>
<p>superhuman levels and</p>
<p>right now they&rsquo;re doing it through</p>
<p>chemicals and they&rsquo;re injecting themselves with things</p>
<p>but eventually</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be much more complicated than that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be genetic engineering</p>
<p>what eventually it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to do is they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be able to genetically</p>
<p>manipulate the code of a</p>
<p>human being</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be able to create</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>that are superhumans</p>
<p>so we have to figure out man</p>
<p>when it comes to</p>
<p>performance enhancing drugs and trying to</p>
<p>level the playing</p>
<p>field so they say</p>
<p>as far as like steroids and sports</p>
<p>what you have</p>
<p>to realize is this is just the beginning it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to get way way way more complex</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re working on mile stat inhibitors</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;ve used</p>
<p>these in mice and the mice</p>
<p>live longer and they jump fucking</p>
<p>three feet in the air and they look like superman</p>
<p>i mean this is</p>
<p>going to happen and people are</p>
<p>going to start taking this</p>
<p>stuff and athletes are</p>
<p>going to start taking it because regular people are</p>
<p>going to start taking it too</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s like fuck i want to live</p>
<p>three times as long i want to be able to jump over</p>
<p>buildings and if someone came along</p>
<p>and they have a pill</p>
<p>and they say hey</p>
<p>brian would you like to take this</p>
<p>super athlete pill there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>you actually live longer you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be healthier</p>
<p>because of it there&rsquo;s no repercussions physically</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s 100</p>
<p>bucks 250 bucks</p>
<p>and just changes you forever</p>
<p>fuck you of course you take it</p>
<p>we would kind</p>
<p>of first i let</p>
<p>other people take</p>
<p>our first at</p>
<p>first but there</p>
<p>would be a day</p>
<p>where we would do</p>
<p>the podcast</p>
<p>first athletes are on the</p>
<p>forefront of that and trying to</p>
<p>tweak and hack</p>
<p>their bodies yes</p>
<p>slowly disseminate down to the general public</p>
<p>where every day</p>
<p>your grade school is taking a pill because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna make them better at</p>
<p>tetherball exactly and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be able to genetically engineer your</p>
<p>child from birth eventually</p>
<p>gambia will say</p>
<p>i want a six foot six you know</p>
<p>super athletic</p>
<p>super mesomorph son</p>
<p>with incredible iq</p>
<p>talk about class wars that is when it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>the shit is</p>
<p>gonna hit the fan</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s like talk</p>
<p>about the haves and haves not your kids have</p>
<p>everything they&rsquo;re born with</p>
<p>supervision</p>
<p>super speed and</p>
<p>super metabolism</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very good</p>
<p>point how can i</p>
<p>keep up with that that&rsquo;s a very good point</p>
<p>but people have to</p>
<p>understand that the inequality and</p>
<p>the inequity of the</p>
<p>world is what fuels</p>
<p>innovation and</p>
<p>what fuels people</p>
<p>competing and competition and</p>
<p>it fuels like change it fuels growth and</p>
<p>evolution and in all forms of</p>
<p>art in all forms of</p>
<p>technology in all forms of anything</p>
<p>where people are</p>
<p>comparing their work to</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s work and trying to compete</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>i mean i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it needs to be complete and</p>
<p>total inequality where</p>
<p>some people are</p>
<p>dying of starvation and</p>
<p>other people are eating diamonds</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a balance to be achieved</p>
<p>there but you have to realize that in competition</p>
<p>is growth and that&rsquo;s how all this that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>motivation the energy behind all this</p>
<p>i just imagine kanye west</p>
<p>starting the new</p>
<p>trend of yeah i&rsquo;m eating pure diamonds</p>
<p>i just mix it into my fucking</p>
<p>smoothies from jamba</p>
<p>juice that&rsquo;s diamonds</p>
<p>motherfuckers</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>drinking yeah</p>
<p>he wouldn&rsquo;t be far behind that</p>
<p>did you hear about</p>
<p>the kids that are</p>
<p>dying off of taking bath salts and plant food</p>
<p>yeah weak ecstasy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called like diamond dust yeah</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about that and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re calling it bath salts to sell it</p>
<p>we were totally confused</p>
<p>when we first did it we thought that basalts</p>
<p>it was actual</p>
<p>basalts and someone figured out that you get high</p>
<p>out of it yeah</p>
<p>but they just</p>
<p>labeled it that way and</p>
<p>apparently the chemical</p>
<p>structure of it is not technically illegal</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like a cousin of something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>illegal yeah it&rsquo;s off it&rsquo;s called methadron i believe</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t put meth in the</p>
<p>it even if it&rsquo;s a ph</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t put meth in the name</p>
<p>of something if you want someone to really try it but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>them to get into it they&rsquo;re making them illegal and</p>
<p>one of the ways they&rsquo;re making them illegal is there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a law that</p>
<p>allows you to make</p>
<p>things illegal that are</p>
<p>next door neighbors cousins to</p>
<p>things that are illegal</p>
<p>you know they use that with</p>
<p>dimethyltryptamine and 5 methoxy dimethyltryptamine</p>
<p>you know 5 methoxy</p>
<p>dmt nn dimethyltrypdine it was the big one that was</p>
<p>used in the 60s and that was</p>
<p>the army research</p>
<p>lab used to fucking they had buckets of this shit</p>
<p>and scientists were getting a hold</p>
<p>of it and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how a mechanic got a hold of it and a lot of</p>
<p>other people got a hold of it</p>
<p>well when they locked that shit down in 1970</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about 5 methoxy dimethyltryptine</p>
<p>which is actually more potent</p>
<p>gram for gram than regular and you</p>
<p>could buy it online man i bought this shit</p>
<p>from american chemical company i</p>
<p>ordered it online</p>
<p>really many many years</p>
<p>ago would it arrive as a powder or</p>
<p>a powder in</p>
<p>a little vitamin bottle</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s enough in that</p>
<p>thing to get barbecued for the rest of your life</p>
<p>you could cook your brain how</p>
<p>do you regulate</p>
<p>and make something illegal that your body</p>
<p>naturally produces and</p>
<p>secretes well you know that&rsquo;s a good point</p>
<p>but you know your body also</p>
<p>naturally secretes testosterone</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s the question</p>
<p>should testosterone</p>
<p>be available</p>
<p>for everyone</p>
<p>well like sad</p>
<p>effects for weed</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like well</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve heard of sativax</p>
<p>right what is that</p>
<p>pharmaceutical form of sativa</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>trials with it in the uk and they</p>
<p>find that oh</p>
<p>these medicinal</p>
<p>marijuana yeah we can regulate it and put it in pill</p>
<p>form and we&rsquo;ll call it sativax and it&rsquo;ll give the same</p>
<p>effects as smoke in a bowl of sativa weed</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve managed to isolate work</p>
<p>yeah it does its</p>
<p>synthetic thc</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re managed to</p>
<p>make a naturally</p>
<p>produced product illegal</p>
<p>right and then sell you the pill form of it</p>
<p>which is created in a lab</p>
<p>right how long before monsanto</p>
<p>starts you know genetically</p>
<p>engineering marijuana and making you know its</p>
<p>strains right</p>
<p>you know bacteria resistant</p>
<p>this and then</p>
<p>throwing johnny</p>
<p>apple seeds</p>
<p>out so everybody&rsquo;s growing it so they can sue you later</p>
<p>so you yeah how</p>
<p>crazy is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re patenting nature</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>bizarre i mean</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to patent pig parts and pigs and</p>
<p>and human organs i mean that&rsquo;s next</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll find a way to</p>
<p>slightly tweak</p>
<p>modify and then patent the</p>
<p>human genome sure</p>
<p>exactly they&rsquo;ll own a certain</p>
<p>level of person and this type of person</p>
<p>you know they can call them like artificial people or</p>
<p>yeah if you want a designer baby that&rsquo;s fine</p>

<p>you know i mean there&rsquo;s the mckinley</p>
<p>to there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>kurtz will do you think so</p>
<p>i hope not do you are you of</p>
<p>familiar at all</p>
<p>with any of</p>
<p>these people like the graham hancocks or</p>
<p>john anthony west to the</p>
<p>world these people that believe that there was</p>
<p>a distant civilization that was</p>
<p>super advanced that somehow or another</p>
<p>everything fucked up</p>
<p>whether it was because of natural disasters</p>
<p>or whether it was because of something man made</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>literally another</p>
<p>generation or</p>
<p>we have rebuilt from 6 000</p>
<p>plus years ago</p>
<p>right like they sent dna</p>
<p>or sent embryos or whatever and shotgun</p>
<p>blast them out into</p>
<p>space no no no</p>
<p>no no oh i&rsquo;ve heard that</p>
<p>theory yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another theory that&rsquo;s pansperia i mean</p>
<p>that well no</p>
<p>i think you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about something differently i&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>stuff that came in on asteroids</p>
<p>but what i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about by this by this</p>
<p>john anthony west and</p>
<p>robert schock</p>
<p>and all these other</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re subscribing to</p>
<p>graham hancock is another one</p>
<p>is that civilization at one</p>
<p>point in time whether it&rsquo;s ten thousand</p>
<p>five hundred</p>
<p>twelve thousand</p>
<p>five hundred</p>
<p>you know bc somewhere else</p>
<p>was like very advanced</p>
<p>right okay so like we are pyramids</p>
<p>and mayans they figured it out and then they somehow</p>
<p>fucked it up</p>
<p>and we survived out of that well i</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re pretty sure that the pyramids were</p>
<p>built at 2 500 bc</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>some other shit</p>
<p>around the pyramids</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s confusing</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>stuff there&rsquo;s like certain</p>
<p>styles of building</p>
<p>and some of them they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>found that are like deep deep</p>
<p>underground that they&rsquo;ve had to</p>
<p>like dig out</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>covered in sand</p>
<p>like you know</p>
<p>the sphinx when they</p>
<p>initially found it</p>
<p>was covered in sand and even back in</p>
<p>the hieroglyph</p>
<p>days sphinx was</p>
<p>covered in sand</p>
<p>like one of the</p>
<p>who it was tut</p>
<p>moses the third i</p>
<p>think almost</p>
<p>had to uncover it</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s part of the hieroglyphs</p>
<p>i think what they&rsquo;re trying to say is that at one</p>
<p>point in time we had achieved</p>
<p>great heights</p>
<p>whether or not</p>
<p>exactly parallel with the way we live</p>
<p>today with technology i mean it</p>
<p>might have been something different</p>
<p>right it might have been harnessing the</p>
<p>power of sun with</p>
<p>mirrors and limestone in a way</p>
<p>that created a nuke blast</p>
<p>as opposed to</p>
<p>or it might have also been a</p>
<p>psychedelically</p>
<p>based society</p>
<p>where we were</p>
<p>much more into shamanic rituals and</p>
<p>communicating with</p>
<p>the spirit world or whatever the fuck that is</p>
<p>it could have been a lot of that too</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s very possible it&rsquo;s very very</p>
<p>possible our</p>
<p>ancestors could have been</p>
<p>candy flippers yes</p>
<p>that could happen yes well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s a lot of evidence to that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of evidence to that i believe that so</p>
<p>you know when you go to the vedic text and you know</p>
<p>i mean they all talk</p>
<p>about a different</p>
<p>psychedelic bruise it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>clear they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about something that you take</p>
<p>you know and look that stuff</p>
<p>existed forever we know that</p>
<p>we also know that ancient</p>
<p>cultures have been worshipping cows</p>
<p>since the beginning of time</p>
<p>and not even eating them even when they&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>starving and that to me</p>
<p>reeks of some deity</p>
<p>why is it a deity oh because we use</p>
<p>their milk and</p>
<p>they plow the</p>
<p>field towards bullshit</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting cow shit and there&rsquo;s mushrooms that grow</p>
<p>that cow shit and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tripping your fucking balls off that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>going on you&rsquo;re worshipping these cows</p>
<p>the worship that they have is not</p>
<p>indicative of anything</p>
<p>other than the consumption of</p>
<p>psychedelics</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like this weird love</p>
<p>for this cow</p>
<p>like to me that&rsquo;s producing</p>
<p>that door that</p>
<p>allows you to unlock</p>
<p>things in your</p>
<p>brain for that to happen</p>
<p>to me that seems</p>
<p>people naturally</p>
<p>identify with</p>
<p>their own type and are as</p>
<p>cruel to animals as they need to be</p>
<p>and when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>starving you need to be</p>
<p>cruel to animals</p>
<p>but yet they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this disconnect from</p>
<p>their actual physical needs</p>
<p>and this love that worships on this</p>
<p>deifying this animal</p>
<p>and we also know that they&rsquo;re big on fucking</p>
<p>psychedelics we know that</p>
<p>their past has lots of</p>
<p>references in the ancient text to</p>
<p>psychedelics and</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>mushrooms grow better on cow shit than anywhere in the</p>
<p>world that&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>power by the way</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s that on a maui you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t know it</p>
<p>right on the island</p>
<p>really you find</p>
<p>them up there you just take the road to hana</p>
<p>and when you&rsquo;re there like the hana</p>
<p>maori resort</p>
<p>the big old hill you just</p>
<p>climb it at</p>
<p>about 6 00 in the morning</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s everywhere</p>
<p>you know the entire pacific</p>
<p>northwest of the united</p>
<p>states the entire pacific northwest</p>
<p>literally is like a mind</p>
<p>of spores it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>one gigantic organism life form like a base of spores</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>everywhere up there</p>
<p>psychedelic mushrooms like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people</p>
<p>that go up there and find them and grow them but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all connected with some i mean</p>
<p>literally if you believe that</p>
<p>psychedelic mushrooms</p>
<p>are some sort of a life form from somewhere else</p>
<p>which a lot of people believe</p>
<p>they believe that</p>
<p>much like they believe that</p>
<p>the pants barrier theory that we were talking</p>
<p>about earlier that</p>
<p>amino acids and all sorts of</p>
<p>water and different</p>
<p>things came from asteroids</p>
<p>hit earth and that started in</p>
<p>seeded life they believe that somehow or another these</p>
<p>spores came from</p>
<p>other planets</p>
<p>you know because</p>
<p>spores can survive in a vacuum and</p>
<p>spores can survive the deep radiation of space and</p>
<p>and to fact that this is like some</p>
<p>something that permeates one entire part of the country</p>
<p>you know i remember</p>
<p>watching or</p>
<p>reading something</p>
<p>about it about</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>if you like</p>
<p>connected it all together like you know</p>
<p>the how far and how wide it is</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>these mushrooms</p>
<p>keep growing in the same space</p>
<p>the same air and then</p>
<p>just know that they</p>
<p>made me see words come out of somebody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mouth once really</p>
<p>that was the fucking</p>
<p>trip of my life</p>
<p>do they look like english words yeah</p>
<p>it was at a moment</p>
<p>i could hear conversations in the</p>
<p>other room i couldn&rsquo;t hear them but i</p>
<p>could literally see words in</p>
<p>3d text form</p>
<p>floating over the partitions in this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>loft in downtown la</p>
<p>i was like what</p>
<p>and i looked at them like</p>
<p>and i started recalling to my friend who was there</p>
<p>granted this is all</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all fucked up</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m like they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about such and such in there</p>
<p>how do you hear that the</p>
<p>music&rsquo;s so loud</p>
<p>i can see it and went in there</p>
<p>and was literally as people were talking to me i was</p>
<p>watching their</p>
<p>mouths open up</p>
<p>and the words that</p>
<p>they were saying were physically coming out as text</p>
<p>their mouths were warping around it</p>
<p>and so i must have looked like a</p>
<p>tweaker and a half watching</p>
<p>these words go by because i was trying to read it</p>
<p>like a ticker</p>
<p>as they were talking so</p>
<p>the outside</p>
<p>where i was scratching and</p>
<p>going like this</p>
<p>they probably</p>
<p>thought they&rsquo;d fuck me up did you ask them if you were</p>
<p>right well i was</p>
<p>absolutely right we talked</p>
<p>about it to</p>
<p>this day like i saw words coming out of people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mouths and was reading</p>
<p>maybe i was hearing it and it was like some</p>
<p>your head was just</p>
<p>yeah like a synesthesia my</p>
<p>brain was going this is what they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know but you</p>
<p>checked with</p>
<p>them about what</p>
<p>they were saying yeah</p>
<p>what were you on</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just mushrooms how much</p>
<p>not that much</p>
<p>lightweight</p>
<p>two couple stems couple caps</p>
<p>really peanut butter</p>
<p>see see what&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>kevin is that</p>
<p>lightweight a lot of people</p>
<p>especially that i met through joe</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re firm believers of like you just</p>
<p>gotta eat a shitload of mushrooms</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never done this my</p>
<p>whole life it&rsquo;s always been like half an eighth</p>
<p>maybe you know</p>
<p>and i just took a that even</p>
<p>sounds like</p>
<p>crazy yeah i just took like</p>
<p>half of a half of the eighth recently</p>
<p>and had probably the</p>
<p>most hardcore visuals i&rsquo;ve ever had in my life really</p>
<p>like mushrooms when</p>
<p>i have friends at</p>
<p>smoke salvia</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>visual distortions in the room</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll look up and the ceiling&rsquo;ll rip apart and</p>
<p>like snow will come in i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cool that</p>
<p>sounds fun when i</p>
<p>smoke it i go to another fucking dimension to</p>
<p>another dimension</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>right the first time i did it</p>
<p>yeah i only did it once and i didn&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>right and i just</p>
<p>did what they did i was like an out of body experience</p>
<p>but you know what you guys are talking about</p>
<p>you absolutely can get a brilliant and beautiful</p>
<p>experience from just a little bit of mushrooms yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no doubt</p>
<p>about it but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the same</p>
<p>experience you</p>
<p>take a lot how do you know that</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;ve done both</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;ve done a little and you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>a lot yeah but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a point of it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about the mushrooms i think</p>
<p>why are you saying how do you know that dude this is</p>
<p>documented throughout</p>
<p>human history people have been doing it the shamanic</p>
<p>way where they take this</p>
<p>large dose in</p>
<p>silent darkness</p>
<p>and they do it and they have a different</p>
<p>experience than when you take</p>
<p>smaller doses and</p>
<p>they know what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve had no</p>
<p>physiologically the different</p>
<p>effects that it has on the</p>
<p>human body but i&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>the most i&rsquo;ve ever had was probably</p>
<p>maybe a quarter of mushrooms before okay but</p>
<p>are you not listening to what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying because if you&rsquo;re saying the most i&rsquo;ve ever had</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have experience</p>
<p>about taking five</p>
<p>grams or six</p>
<p>grams i know you don&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>experience no</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m saying in a different way</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve had a quarter before</p>
<p>and yes i&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>a crazy ass shroom</p>
<p>experience i had</p>
<p>half of an eighth the other day</p>
<p>and it blew that shit out of the</p>
<p>water times a million</p>
<p>then it was just different mushrooms it</p>
<p>could be that it also could be</p>
<p>where you are physically</p>
<p>it could be what you had in your stomach it</p>
<p>could be you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of different</p>
<p>things but that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean anything because you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t had the full</p>
<p>blown experience of the big</p>
<p>to compare it to yeah</p>
<p>but does it even do anything when it gets to a certain</p>
<p>point i was gonna</p>
<p>say for me at some</p>
<p>point i don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s beyond that because i</p>
<p>would have pissed myself and vomited</p>
<p>one of those</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t go any</p>
<p>further than that physically</p>
<p>mckenna did a</p>
<p>lecture once and he was talking</p>
<p>about a friend of his that</p>
<p>who chose to</p>
<p>remain anonymous but he was like this</p>
<p>crazy psychedelic guy who</p>
<p>every time he did mushrooms</p>
<p>his goal was to try to tolerate more</p>
<p>and he would go to like 10</p>
<p>grams and have</p>
<p>these like god knows</p>
<p>what you do is you literally</p>
<p>completely dissolve you cease to</p>
<p>exist and you</p>
<p>make contact</p>
<p>with whatever the fuck it is that you&rsquo;re making contact</p>
<p>it seems like</p>
<p>at first it seems</p>
<p>like another life form it seems like some sort of a</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s communicating with you and then somewhere</p>
<p>along the line</p>
<p>it becomes like another world</p>
<p>it becomes like</p>
<p>this goes away</p>
<p>and you go into this next</p>
<p>sort of dimension</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible it&rsquo;s so religious and beautiful</p>
<p>and when i say religious it&rsquo;s like iconic imagery</p>
<p>but almost indescribable because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>morphing and</p>
<p>changing around you but it&rsquo;s all like</p>
<p>love and wisdom and</p>
<p>warmth and septance</p>
<p>as powerful</p>
<p>as what it&rsquo;s not poison the ld50 rate</p>
<p>is ridiculously high</p>
<p>you have to eat like</p>
<p>shitloads of mushrooms to die</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not poison to</p>
<p>die yes but probably not i mean mushrooms is a mushroom</p>
<p>it is a poison to your body no it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>mushroom&rsquo;s not poison brian it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>salt is poison is salt poison</p>
<p>well if you eat a half</p>
<p>pound of salt you fucking die</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not salt is not a poison</p>
<p>strict nine&rsquo;s a fucking poison what</p>
<p>psychedelic drugs are is there something that</p>
<p>allows your</p>
<p>body to tune into whatever the fuck it is to change</p>
<p>the chemical composition of your</p>
<p>brain to fuck with your</p>
<p>neurochemistry to the</p>
<p>point where you</p>
<p>but to be fair some</p>
<p>would define</p>
<p>that as a poison</p>
<p>we would say you&rsquo;re poisoning your body</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no negative</p>
<p>health effect</p>
<p>everything is</p>
<p>reacting but you don&rsquo;t but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t wreck</p>
<p>your butt it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shocking some</p>
<p>people have</p>
<p>worn out mushrooms and psilocybin</p>
<p>to depressiveness bipolarism</p>
<p>manic states now i&rsquo;m not yeah</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not good</p>
<p>studies exactly</p>
<p>those people</p>
<p>could&rsquo;ve easily get</p>
<p>which is why they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>which is psychedelic</p>
<p>hardcore drugs just like they</p>
<p>say salvia killed some kid but</p>
<p>he was having issues and i&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>of course so yeah</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m saying is</p>
<p>you know i i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>absolutely with you that</p>
<p>small doses can give you beautiful</p>
<p>experiences but it&rsquo;s a different thing</p>
<p>than the high doses the high doses are ego</p>
<p>obliterating i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never achieve that</p>
<p>no you scared oh yeah scared</p>
<p>homie from that last time man</p>
<p>i know i had a flight the next day and i</p>
<p>ended up at</p>
<p>lax swiping my credit card from terminal to terminal</p>
<p>in the machines hoping one</p>
<p>would recognize my</p>
<p>itinerary and spit it out</p>
<p>oh this was really unprofessional</p>
<p>i probably shouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>eaten all those mushrooms the</p>
<p>night before a flight to new york in a</p>
<p>shoot but you figured out how to get there how</p>
<p>could you not figure out how to look at your</p>
<p>phone in your</p>
<p>email that tells you</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re supposed</p>
<p>to go one of</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>i good shit</p>
<p>i had a really</p>
<p>strong dmt trip</p>
<p>which is the last one that i had and i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t done anything</p>
<p>like that in a couple of years</p>
<p>because it was so</p>
<p>powerful that for like</p>
<p>a couple weeks afterwards</p>
<p>nothing seemed normal</p>
<p>i mean everything worked</p>
<p>i could read i</p>
<p>could watch tv i</p>
<p>could have conversations i</p>
<p>could talk to people no one would know</p>
<p>that behind the surface i was like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t believe in the</p>
<p>world anymore i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>trust in this dimension</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re waiting for</p>
<p>morpheus to load a</p>
<p>patch to fly a helicopter to your brain yeah</p>
<p>believe now you&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>matrix it was so</p>
<p>it was so humbling and so</p>
<p>crazy and moving and people go</p>
<p>bro it&rsquo;s just fucking drugs man</p>
<p>just doing drugs</p>
<p>and you get your heads getting all fucked up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all you doing is you doing drugs</p>
<p>maybe maybe</p>
<p>maybe not you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not really sure what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on but i guarantee you that</p>
<p>changed my life</p>
<p>i can guarantee</p>
<p>you that whatever that is if it&rsquo;s just drugs</p>
<p>that just drugs</p>
<p>changed me as a</p>
<p>human being and made me reevaluate everything</p>
<p>you know n is</p>
<p>still to this day like</p>
<p>haunted that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s just religion</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just something you believe in that changes</p>
<p>every facet</p>
<p>of your life that</p>
<p>has given you visions and made you appreciate</p>
<p>things in a new way that&rsquo;s all it is well it&rsquo;s just the</p>
<p>real it&rsquo;s the real religion the real religion is the</p>
<p>psychedelic experience</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s a john</p>
<p>marco allegro book they&rsquo;re all just israel</p>
<p>that used to prescribe to them</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a john</p>
<p>marco allegro book who is</p>
<p>one of the scholars that reviewed the dead sea</p>
<p>scrolls he deciphered the dead sea</p>
<p>scrolls for 14 years worked on it</p>
<p>and at the end of 14 years he said</p>
<p>that the entire</p>
<p>christian religion was a huge misunderstanding</p>
<p>and what it really was</p>
<p>about was the consumption of</p>
<p>psychedelic mushrooms and fertility cults and he</p>
<p>wraps it all up it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>almost impossible to follow to follow</p>
<p>the origins of the words and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>trippy shit but</p>
<p>the fact that this guy&rsquo;s got it locked down</p>
<p>to this one mushroom this</p>
<p>psychedelic mushroom that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>taken throughout europe constantly</p>
<p>and we know that the vikings</p>
<p>took mushrooms and they</p>
<p>would go on berserkers</p>
<p>you know they</p>
<p>would call they</p>
<p>would get fucked</p>
<p>up on mushrooms and then go attack villages</p>
<p>you know i mean that&rsquo;s how they were</p>
<p>yeah man they</p>
<p>would get high on</p>
<p>mushrooms i</p>
<p>still maintain i</p>
<p>found my spirituality on salvia</p>
<p>i started with</p>
<p>small doses and then i&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>about six times and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna do it</p>
<p>again because the last time i did it was so fucking</p>
<p>powerful and</p>
<p>magical very</p>
<p>similar to your dmt</p>
<p>experience but</p>
<p>salvia&rsquo;s super potent</p>
<p>i flew out of my</p>
<p>brain you know</p>
<p>and just went kind of can atomic and</p>
<p>i saw parallel universes</p>
<p>parallel dimensions</p>
<p>spiraling out of the corner of my eye</p>
<p>like i was just sort of floating</p>
<p>in this abyss</p>
<p>and i saw it was rotating it was making a</p>
<p>noise it had gravity to it</p>
<p>and it was almost like i</p>
<p>could see wedges of reality</p>
<p>if i couldn&rsquo;t look directly at it it</p>
<p>would blind me</p>
<p>but out of my peripheral i</p>
<p>could see these</p>
<p>wedges of reality</p>
<p>going by and i was like what is that what is that and</p>
<p>something said just fucking go for it and so</p>
<p>i remember reaching out my hand</p>
<p>what it felt like my hand at the time</p>
<p>and it slowed the</p>
<p>sphere down</p>
<p>and then it sucked me into one of</p>
<p>those wedges and</p>
<p>i felt like i was a kid</p>
<p>running around in what felt like a russian stadium for</p>
<p>whatever reason holding a flag and there was confetti</p>
<p>and i was with a</p>
<p>bunch of other</p>
<p>kids like it was a halftime celebration or some shit</p>
<p>and i was like yeah we</p>
<p>it felt as real</p>
<p>as any other</p>
<p>experience i had in my life and i shotgunned</p>
<p>out of it and then it was rotating and i went</p>
<p>oh what can i do that</p>
<p>again and i reached down and slowed it down</p>
<p>and i went in and i was driving a</p>
<p>it was like another reality</p>
<p>that i could have been living</p>
<p>and it was just</p>
<p>all dimensions and you can&rsquo;t tell me what</p>
<p>you can tell me it was drugs drugs drugs cause it</p>
<p>totally was to some extent</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t tell me it wasn&rsquo;t as real as any</p>
<p>other experience that i had when i came to on the couch</p>
<p>i just went holy shit you&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>freaking me out man</p>
<p>did you record all these</p>
<p>like a good</p>
<p>salvia user</p>
<p>well yes yes i did actually</p>
<p>everybody was running it down</p>
<p>i had one in the tank</p>
<p>where i had</p>
<p>eaten some pot</p>
<p>and when you eat a lot of pot</p>
<p>especially if you eat the really</p>
<p>strong shed you can have some incredible visuals man</p>
<p>have you ever</p>
<p>eaten in on a</p>
<p>plane then closed</p>
<p>your eyes and see like cartoons and like</p>
<p>not a pot i</p>
<p>see things just not</p>
<p>too long ago on some edibles</p>
<p>i had a very similar</p>
<p>vision whatever it is hallucination</p>
<p>a parallel dimensions and you have</p>
<p>what mine with</p>
<p>mine they were i was in the center of what it</p>
<p>started out with me what it</p>
<p>started out with is like</p>
<p>with the tank</p>
<p>how many times you done the tank</p>
<p>only like three or four</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never done it high</p>
<p>oh she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what the fuck is</p>
<p>wrong with you</p>
<p>son you met some dude named</p>
<p>crash on the</p>
<p>boardwalk who was trying to tell me</p>
<p>about vibrating my spirit</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;s like yeah hop in my tank yeah he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy but he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right he&rsquo;s right about</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t but grudge me smoking pot before i happen to</p>
<p>crash his time machine</p>
<p>i played too many</p>
<p>point and click adventure games to know that</p>
<p>that could end with race with me</p>
<p>it started out it</p>
<p>started out just getting to the center</p>
<p>relaxing letting go</p>
<p>and then once i let</p>
<p>go then it always feels like once i get to a certain</p>
<p>point of relaxation and i</p>
<p>completely calmed my mind</p>
<p>and then it</p>
<p>starts to take</p>
<p>me away almost like as if i feel like i&rsquo;m in a river</p>
<p>i feel like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>awash in so</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sort of</p>
<p>invisible yeah</p>
<p>well as i was doing this</p>
<p>i came to a point</p>
<p>where i recognized</p>
<p>my space and then the</p>
<p>space of the planet and then the planet in the</p>
<p>space of the galaxy and the galaxy and the</p>
<p>space of the universe</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>whole universe became like this bubble</p>
<p>that was trapped inside some gigantic infinite</p>
<p>like ball of yarn</p>
<p>and each thread</p>
<p>of this ball of yarn</p>
<p>was like one universe</p>
<p>after another universe and they were all together</p>
<p>swirling in this moving ball of yarn</p>
<p>of universes connected like circles connected</p>
<p>even with a tube like they connected them all together</p>
<p>and it was all</p>
<p>luminescent and it was all</p>
<p>i was trying to take in all the information that was</p>
<p>going on all</p>
<p>these different various</p>
<p>worlds but it was all different and all the same</p>
<p>and it was all happening</p>
<p>simultaneously</p>
<p>and as i was trying to figure out</p>
<p>how big this</p>
<p>this ball of yarn is</p>
<p>it got literally too big</p>
<p>for me to wrap my head around then i snapped out of it</p>
<p>and i lost it how long were you in the tank</p>
<p>couple hours couple</p>
<p>hours yeah the deeper i get</p>
<p>the longer i&rsquo;m in there the more i can</p>
<p>relax and it&rsquo;s almost like you achieve</p>
<p>different wavelengths different mind</p>
<p>frequencies you know</p>
<p>i mean i know that you do in</p>
<p>meditation and extreme</p>
<p>meditation like they&rsquo;ve taken</p>
<p>monks and they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done studies i</p>
<p>am so jealous and envious of that shit</p>
<p>monks well just the people that can deep</p>
<p>meditate and get to that</p>
<p>place versus needing to take salvia or needing</p>
<p>some dmt i got</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not capable of shutting it all off like that but</p>
<p>if you do that</p>
<p>deep meditating like</p>
<p>every day yeah if i did it</p>
<p>every day and that was my only</p>
<p>existence then sure that it&rsquo;s fine but</p>
<p>i got a mortgage</p>
<p>yeah dude i got a</p>
<p>cheat to get to</p>
<p>space you want to get laid</p>
<p>okay you wanna watch tv</p>
<p>fuck all that monks i need</p>
<p>netflix and cartoons</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll find the universe by smokin it</p>
<p>you can get it there though you can</p>
<p>i had a conversation with my ego on salvia that wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i found it inside the visualizer of my xbox 360 of all</p>
<p>places that son of a</p>
<p>bitch was hiding</p>
<p>down there i</p>
<p>put that on and</p>
<p>what happened at the time you</p>
<p>could use the vision cam so when you move around it</p>
<p>would make the visuals on the</p>
<p>screen go nuts</p>
<p>jeff minter is a genius</p>
<p>remember the 3</p>
<p>geo when it</p>
<p>get do you remember the 3do</p>
<p>at all you saw the video</p>
<p>the console yeah 3do</p>
<p>he used to come with a</p>
<p>trippy game</p>
<p>where you can control this</p>
<p>kaleidoscope and when i used to be a kid do i love acid</p>
<p>that was like the</p>
<p>first lava okay get to your ego well i</p>
<p>we took a rip and handed the bowl</p>
<p>to a friend was like oh shit and there it went and i</p>
<p>started dissolving the similar</p>
<p>single molecule</p>
<p>oh and within my</p>
<p>couch now my</p>
<p>couch is made of molecules</p>
<p>cool get out of that</p>
<p>projected forth and was like oh the xbox looks pretty</p>
<p>sweet right now why don&rsquo;t i just fly into that</p>
<p>and i did and there was this</p>
<p>pulsating ball</p>
<p>after i went through all</p>
<p>these little wormholes and</p>
<p>tunnel and it was</p>
<p>pulsating to the beat of the</p>
<p>music that was happening</p>
<p>and i knew that i</p>
<p>could go further but i was like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on here and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>oh i&rsquo;m every</p>
<p>issue you have</p>
<p>right now you know exactly what i am</p>
<p>and i was like oh fuck</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s in my xbox visualizer what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on bro</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like you know you need to get an</p>
<p>order you know you need to fucking fix</p>
<p>your shit i was like yeah i know i know he&rsquo;s like so</p>
<p>relax and fix it</p>
<p>all right we had a</p>
<p>whole conversation and i was like</p>
<p>cool can i go swim around the visuals now he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>party on bro like totally</p>
<p>gave you the</p>
<p>permission to go flying around</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the most amazing and</p>
<p>underappreciated</p>
<p>aspects of any</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>experience is the work that you do on your</p>
<p>own personality in your mind and uncovering all the</p>
<p>bullshit that&rsquo;s fucking with you that&rsquo;s why people have</p>
<p>not everybody</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>some of my friends have had bad trips</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s obvious</p>
<p>oh i reached a</p>
<p>point where i felt like i was</p>
<p>gonna die and</p>
<p>i felt like no you were getting deconstructed as a</p>
<p>human being and you</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t ready to come to grips with the fact that there</p>
<p>might be something bigger than you</p>
<p>that there might be something real</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about to experience and you couldn&rsquo;t let that go</p>
<p>yeah absolutely that</p>
<p>was the issue</p>
<p>paranoia i mean</p>
<p>we had this conversation many times and someone</p>
<p>recently brought this up</p>
<p>on the message</p>
<p>board they were talking</p>
<p>about the people that get paranoia</p>
<p>the people that aren&rsquo;t dealing with their life</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got some shit that they don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>about themselves</p>
<p>they feel fucking creepy</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the reason why they freak out</p>
<p>every time they get high</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the marijuana does not</p>
<p>allow you to have secrets</p>
<p>marijuana turn some</p>
<p>lights on the corner in the attic of your</p>
<p>house and goes</p>
<p>hey what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s all this shit over here</p>
<p>what are you hiding over here was that</p>
<p>kid&rsquo;s scatter</p>
<p>out through your</p>
<p>mouth and your eyes and</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house i had my internal monologue</p>
<p>switched with my external monologue once on</p>
<p>on mushrooms and i remember like looking at</p>
<p>him like why the fuck are you looking at me right now</p>
<p>like what are you doing</p>
<p>is that a red</p>
<p>watch why the fuck are you staring at me</p>
<p>like that right</p>
<p>now and i was saying it all out loud</p>
<p>it was completely</p>
<p>switched for</p>
<p>about 30 minutes people</p>
<p>were chatting with my internal monologue and i was</p>
<p>everything i wanted</p>
<p>to externalize was swallowed inside it was like fuck</p>
<p>like thankfully i&rsquo;m a decent enough person</p>
<p>to i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>admit to the</p>
<p>bodies in the basement but</p>
<p>that could have been</p>
<p>bad do you believe</p>
<p>do you think that</p>
<p>psychedelics</p>
<p>have you ever even considered</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>agents of human</p>
<p>evolution and that they&rsquo;re here to rocket</p>
<p>rocket you forward</p>
<p>and rocket us forward and the reason why we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>monkeys i mean i</p>
<p>i believe in a mixture of all</p>
<p>those things but i certainly can</p>
<p>understand an animal taking something and</p>
<p>thinking about</p>
<p>a rock in a different way and</p>
<p>going that could be a</p>
<p>spear to kill an animal</p>
<p>right you know like why the fuck not</p>
<p>if i could see</p>
<p>other planets and have a chat with my xbox visuals</p>
<p>why couldn&rsquo;t a gorilla</p>
<p>in a forest have realized a better way to keep warm</p>
<p>yeah psychedelic mushrooms have been around the current</p>
<p>state for thousands and thousands and</p>
<p>thousands of years long predating what we know of as</p>
<p>human civilization</p>
<p>we know monkeys we eat anything they&rsquo;ll try shit out</p>
<p>you know they try anything out they&rsquo;ll pee in their own</p>
<p>mouths in a tree it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>greatest video ever</p>
<p>it is pretty good they&rsquo;ll do whatever</p>
<p>they want it&rsquo;s almost as good as the one where he</p>
<p>flashlights the frog</p>
<p>oh my god that poor</p>
<p>frog i love it</p>
<p>he goes through</p>
<p>that frog he goes</p>
<p>through like the gorilla sutra like he</p>
<p>tries different positions with it it&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna sit on my back</p>
<p>nah that&rsquo;s not enough</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna teabag him for a</p>
<p>while like he really puts that frog</p>
<p>to its taste</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s amazing that people are sitting there</p>
<p>watching too</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>laughing and filming</p>
<p>it and joking around families are there and shit</p>
<p>and this chimp is just</p>
<p>mouth fucking the shit out his front</p>
<p>meanwhile hide your</p>
<p>eyes from real sex and turn your eyes</p>
<p>towards all the slaughter</p>
<p>and murder on tv</p>
<p>yeah you know we talked</p>
<p>about this before but i&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>bring it out one more time before we get out of here</p>
<p>a video website that had</p>
<p>this horrific</p>
<p>video of a drug killing in mexico</p>
<p>and this guy had been</p>
<p>chopped up into all sorts of</p>
<p>pieces they showed</p>
<p>everything in</p>
<p>graphic detail</p>
<p>except they cut his hands off</p>
<p>and in one of the hands was his</p>
<p>dick and balls and his dick and balls they blurred it</p>
<p>like what got a</p>
<p>pixel like that we can&rsquo;t let the kids know</p>
<p>what else a</p>
<p>ridiculous weird</p>
<p>world do you</p>
<p>think that do you</p>
<p>think i mean you hear</p>
<p>about the protests</p>
<p>going on right now in mexico do you</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about to boil over really really fast what is</p>
<p>going on what are the</p>
<p>thousands of people in the streets</p>
<p>about the drug cartels and the violence</p>
<p>on the same day that they discovered mass graves and</p>
<p>yeah they discovered another mass</p>
<p>grave yeah this is the same</p>
<p>place where there&rsquo;s 72 people recently this is over</p>
<p>50 people it&rsquo;s terrifying man but i mean that&rsquo;s really</p>
