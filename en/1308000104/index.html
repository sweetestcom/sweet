    <p>Just a couple of questions</p>
<p>before we kick off.</p>
<p>OK, look, it&rsquo;s what I told you before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad bitch o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>OK, it&rsquo;s thick 30.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been through a lot</p>
<p>sacks right now, but I&rsquo;m still 30.</p>
<p>OK, is everybody back up</p>
<p>in the building sacks?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a minute.</p>
<p>Tell me how you&rsquo;re healing</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m about</p>
<p>to get into my feelings.</p>
<p>How you feel on sacks?</p>
<p>How you feel right now?</p>
<p>What language are you speaking right now?</p>
<p>Is that what you&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called hip hop sacks.</p>
<p>You right.</p>
<p>Remember when you had</p>
<p>at your 50th?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, when you had</p>
<p>and she sang</p>
<p>and she sang.</p>
<p>And your.</p>
<p>Was dancing to.</p>
<p>Delete that.</p>
<p>Delete that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start executing</p>
<p>the insta strike with Jake.</p>
<p>Why insta strike?</p>
<p>Well, when he says something</p>
<p>that we just insta strikes,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have to edit it later.</p>
<p>Just insta strike.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because I am</p>
<p>taking back my power.</p>
<p>I was in therapy the other day</p>
<p>and they told me</p>
<p>I need to take back my power.</p>
<p>Insta strike.</p>
<p>But he apparently reads</p>
<p>the comments section</p>
<p>because he knew Friedberg</p>
<p>that you won the episode last week.</p>
<p>Oh, big time.</p>
<p>Which I agree with.</p>
<p>I thought you did a great job.</p>
<p>It was big Friedberg energy.</p>
<p>Finally, I honestly do not</p>
<p>like the competitive</p>
<p>nature of the show.</p>
<p>I think it makes us all hate each other</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not a good dynamic.</p>
<p>We should just fucking do</p>
<p>the show with each other.</p>
<p>I know, but the point is</p>
<p>your performance</p>
<p>after I threatened to fire</p>
<p>if the show has gone up.</p>
<p>You know who also doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like the competitive nature?</p>
<p>Jake out because he&rsquo;s losing.</p>
<p>Yeah, totally.</p>
<p>The fact that I&rsquo;m even still here</p>
<p>is winning.</p>
<p>I love how Jake out</p>
<p>thinks he can threaten to fire Friedberg.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the janitor at Staples Center</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s going to fire LeBron</p>
<p>because he played poorly in a game.</p>
<p>This is a motivational technique.</p>
<p>I got the best out of him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like Michael Jordan.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s my Dennis Rodman.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like the hot dog dealer.</p>
<p>OK, pal.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like LeBron James.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the hot dog dealer.</p>
<p>I do not insta strike these comments.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain man, David.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going.</p>
<p>And instead, we open source it to the fans</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>I squeeze.</p>
<p>All right, everybody.</p>
<p>Welcome to the all in pod with us again.</p>
<p>David Friedberg took a break</p>
<p>from playing his stray video cat game.</p>
<p>Saks is here in his deposition.</p>
<p>Apparently, Chamath.</p>
<p>By the way, do you guys want to see this?</p>
<p>Look at the size of this.</p>
<p>Jekyll&rsquo;s apparently playing no comment today</p>
<p>on the comments.</p>
<p>So I will open the show.</p>
<p>I will open the show by asking David Saks,</p>
<p>would you like to tell us</p>
<p>about what you&rsquo;re holding in your hand?</p>
<p>Yeah, OK.</p>
<p>So I got this subpoena from Twitter.</p>
<p>This is a non party subpoena for didn&rsquo;t Twitter subpoena your tweets?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Let me get to that.</p>
<p>Wait, is this a peanut?</p>
<p>I thought they&rsquo;re public.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>These nitwits have walked</p>
<p>to lift and billing them a probably two thousand dollars an hour</p>
<p>to subpoena tweets that are public.</p>
<p>Brilliant strategy.</p>
<p>But this is called a subpoena for production of business records</p>
<p>in an action pending outside California.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not a party to the laws.</p>
<p>At least they&rsquo;re not suing me</p>
<p>because I have no involvement in this thing.</p>
<p>But they sent me the broadest ever subpoena.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 30 pages of requests.</p>
<p>And now I got to hire a lawyer to go quash this thing</p>
<p>because they basically want any of my communications</p>
<p>with any of my friends over the last six months.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>Saks, can you just explain to the audience</p>
<p>and to us like this is a court sanctioned subpoena.</p>
<p>The court is basically allowing the lawyers to demand</p>
<p>that you hand over these communications.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Yeah, but I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to fight it yet.</p>
<p>So now at my own expense, I got to hire a lawyer</p>
<p>and go send them to fight it</p>
<p>because this is a ridiculous, overbroad subpoena.</p>
<p>And by the way, I&rsquo;m not even involved in this thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a commenter on Twitter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any.</p>
<p>Let me just save</p>
<p>Wachtell Lipton a lot of time right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in possession of nonpublic information about this.</p>
<p>And the craziest thing is, yeah, like you mentioned,</p>
<p>they cite my tweets as an exhibit here</p>
<p>and they say they want all documents</p>
<p>and communications concerning your statement</p>
<p>in a tweet dated April 16th</p>
<p>that the quote new Twitter CEO checklist</p>
<p>includes eliminate all bots and fire useless employees.</p>
<p>50% question mark.</p>
<p>So obviously they didn&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>Your statement in a tweet dated April 25th.</p>
<p>Crazy thought, what if Jack masterminded this whole thing?</p>
<p>Your statement in a tweet dated July 18th</p>
<p>that quote randomly sampling 100 accounts a day</p>
<p>is not a serious effort.</p>
<p>And or your statements in any other tweet</p>
<p>concerning the merger, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Let me just save them time right now.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have documents and communications</p>
<p>concerning my tweets.</p>
<p>Now I know to a lawyer at Wachtell Lipton</p>
<p>that looking at my tweets and how brilliant they are,</p>
<p>you may think that I have extensive documentation</p>
<p>and source material for them.</p>
<p>But let me tell you what happened.</p>
<p>I went to go take a shit</p>
<p>and I basically tweeted off the cuff</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how that tweet ended up in the public record.</p>
<p>There are no documents and communications</p>
<p>concerning my tweets.</p>
<p>And this idea that somehow,</p>
<p>I guess what they&rsquo;re trying to get at</p>
<p>is that somehow I was tweeting on behalf of someone</p>
<p>or at someone&rsquo;s behest, not true.</p>
<p>Go look well before this year at my public tweets and blogs</p>
<p>about the topic of free speech.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a critic of Twitter&rsquo;s for a long time</p>
<p>on the issue of free speech.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written a content moderation policy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about what I think a content moderation policy</p>
<p>for a social network that cares about free speech should be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written all these posts on Medium going back years now.</p>
<p>I was a critic of Twitter</p>
<p>throwing Donald Trump off the platform.</p>
<p>So these views that I&rsquo;ve publicly stated are,</p>
<p>the reason I&rsquo;ve stated them is they&rsquo;re just my views</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s just nothing more nefarious</p>
<p>or something behind them other than that.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just, I think they&rsquo;re just trying to</p>
<p>chase a there that&rsquo;s, there is no there there.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So let me just say that in a lot of time.</p>
<p>You and I can talk</p>
<p>because our friends have no comment on this matter.</p>
<p>I just have one question.</p>
<p>I have a follow up question.</p>
<p>During this movement that you had</p>
<p>and you composed the tweet,</p>
<p>is there any documentation of the movement?</p>
<p>No, but you know, next time that I compose a tweet</p>
<p>on the can, I will document it thoroughly</p>
<p>and I will send it to the lawyers at Wachtell Lipton.</p>
<p>Zach, what happens if you don&rsquo;t respond in 20 days?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I gotta, I mean, now I&rsquo;ve hired a lawyer,</p>
<p>but by the way, just so people understand,</p>
<p>you may think that because of my position in business</p>
<p>or something that these things happen all the time.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been maybe subpoenaed like three times</p>
<p>in my entire career and I&rsquo;ve never been subpoenaed</p>
<p>in my capacity as an individual.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always been in connection with a company</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve gotten one of these</p>
<p>in over five years.</p>
<p>So this just does not happen that often.</p>
<p>These guys are totally chasing at straws</p>
<p>and it leads me to believe they&rsquo;re wasting my time</p>
<p>and Twitter&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re trying-</p>
<p>So somebody at Twitter should just rein in their lawyers</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re, I&rsquo;m sure,</p>
<p>racking up a fortune in legal fees.</p>
<p>It sounds like, Zach, the case is that they&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to make that Elon used his network of friends</p>
<p>to help wash away the deal</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t like the price anymore</p>
<p>and had his friends kind of tweet about bots</p>
<p>and other stuff to support his case for killing the deal</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t like the price.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re trying to see if there&rsquo;s any communications</p>
<p>that he specifically said he didn&rsquo;t like the price.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, look, in addition to my tweets,</p>
<p>they want all my documents and correspondence</p>
<p>related to my appearance on Megyn Kelly,</p>
<p>my appearance on the Will Kane podcast</p>
<p>and other media appearances that I&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>Look, I had no coordination with Elon</p>
<p>before appearing on any of those shows.</p>
<p>I just went on those shows and said what I think.</p>
<p>I mean, look, it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m a guy</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t have hot takes every single week</p>
<p>on various issues.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been doing this podcast for years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been tweeting for years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a commentator on this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been in possession of non-public information</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve tweeted my takes based on the public information</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been available about this dispute.</p>
<p>Now, after I appeared, for example, on Will Kane,</p>
<p>I remember Elon tweeted in support of my appearance,</p>
<p>but there was no coordination before I appeared</p>
<p>or after for that matter.</p>
<p>He just liked the appearance.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just me spouting off doing what I&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>on this pod and tweeting for years.</p>
<p>Now I can understand if maybe they&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to read something into it,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on a fishing expedition,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve just told you what the truth is.</p>
<p>I think the whole thing is just such</p>
<p>an enormous waste of time.</p>
<p>Just get into court, adjudicate the thing and move on.</p>
<p>I was reading yesterday,</p>
<p>this guy who follows the Delaware courts pretty closely,</p>
<p>he had a bunch of commentary</p>
<p>and he mimicked some of the stuff</p>
<p>or the judge apparently on the case said some stuff</p>
<p>about preserving the integrity of the court,</p>
<p>meaning that the interpretation people are making</p>
<p>is that ultimately they don&rsquo;t wanna,</p>
<p>the court is unlikely to try and force the merger</p>
<p>because if the merger then doesn&rsquo;t get consummated,</p>
<p>it damages the reputation of the court&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to make enforcement action.</p>
<p>And therefore it&rsquo;s more likely</p>
<p>that they just impose a fine.</p>
<p>But what is the enforcement action if,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, we should ask somebody who&rsquo;s a-</p>
<p>Force the merger.</p>
<p>No, but-</p>
<p>Force Elon to buy Twitter.</p>
<p>But what does that mean, force?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that.</p>
<p>Okay, all I know is that this discovery request</p>
<p>is overly broad, it&rsquo;s a fishing expedition,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s harassment of me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna cost me time and money to get rid of this thing.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t do anything to deserve it or prompt this.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t part of the transaction, I just wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve never said anything in regards to the transaction</p>
<p>that should lead anyone to believe</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m in possession of non-public information.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So this is harassment as punitive</p>
<p>and the fact that they&rsquo;re citing my tweets</p>
<p>in which I criticize Twitter&rsquo;s management,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just petty and vindictive.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>I mean, look-</p>
<p>Can you get your legal fees reimbursed?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably not.</p>
<p>Good luck, no.</p>
<p>Five or six years ago, I approached Twitter</p>
<p>about what I would have called a friendly activist,</p>
<p>myself and another large fund.</p>
<p>And the reality is there&rsquo;s a lot of data</p>
<p>that sits in the public domain</p>
<p>that you can use to get a very clear view</p>
<p>of Twitter&rsquo;s advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>And so all of these issues that Twitter is dealing with</p>
<p>has been known for a long time</p>
<p>to people that spend any time analyzing the stock,</p>
<p>comparing it to other social media stocks.</p>
<p>So I just don&rsquo;t understand what all of this is about.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, a person that had a point of view</p>
<p>has changed their mind,</p>
<p>get to the bottom of what that person thinks,</p>
<p>but going on these broad fishing expedition,</p>
<p>I think is just really stupid.</p>
<p>And then what was Joe Lonsdale subpoenaed for?</p>
<p>I mean, he just appeared-</p>
<p>For being at the All in Summit.</p>
<p>For being a guest at the All in Summit.</p>
<p>So that just shows you how silly this is too,</p>
<p>because Elon, we did an interview,</p>
<p>the four of us interviewed Elon at the All in Summit</p>
<p>in Miami back in, was it May?</p>
<p>When did we do that?</p>
<p>Yeah, May.</p>
<p>So Elon appeared, but he dialed in by Zoom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like he was walking around the hallways,</p>
<p>bumping into people and talking.</p>
<p>He did not communicate with anybody else at the summit.</p>
<p>He was a guest by Zoom.</p>
<p>So if you want to know the communications that we had,</p>
<p>just go watch that public recording of us interviewing Elon.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just, again,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no need for this fishing expedition.</p>
<p>Guys, this is the record</p>
<p>for the longest amount of time in his life.</p>
<p>J. Cal has not spoken.</p>
<p>So I want to acknowledge this moment</p>
<p>and we can move forward.</p>
<p>Sax, did you do any prep work</p>
<p>for the interview with Elon while you were?</p>
<p>Wow, good question.</p>
<p>In the commode?</p>
<p>In the commode?</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s no prep work.</p>
<p>I showed up.</p>
<p>Barely.</p>
<p>I barely showed up.</p>
<p>Barely.</p>
<p>I barely showed up.</p>
<p>You guys remember.</p>
<p>Barely.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>See, and you guys don&rsquo;t want to do All in Summit 2022.</p>
<p>Come on, 23.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Why do I need another one of these?</p>
<p>I actually want to have</p>
<p>Friedberg stands create an event honoring him</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to appear there as the keynote speaker.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Sultan of science con.</p>
<p>Actually, I should really thank you, J. Cal.</p>
<p>Yeah, totally.</p>
<p>For throwing this summit.</p>
<p>Thanks, J. Cal.</p>
<p>First, I blame Twitter&rsquo;s executives.</p>
<p>Then I blame you.</p>
<p>I think you could put, listen,</p>
<p>if we do another All in Summit,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s profitable and we can pay our legal bills.</p>
<p>Can I just say like as a user,</p>
<p>just as a user, okay?</p>
<p>Commentary.</p>
<p>The bot issue is really real.</p>
<p>Like how many accounts are there</p>
<p>which have like 20 or 30 followers</p>
<p>that just spew vitriol,</p>
<p>either positive or negative constantly.</p>
<p>Every time you tweet anything,</p>
<p>it makes tweeting impossible.</p>
<p>I used to be an ardent user of Twitter.</p>
<p>And I think in the last year</p>
<p>it has become exceptionally unusable.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And so they should just fix it.</p>
<p>They should fix that product quality problem.</p>
<p>In fairness to Saks,</p>
<p>he did pay $10 per account to have those created</p>
<p>and to troll your replies.</p>
<p>But it is true.</p>
<p>If you, I always screenshot it.</p>
<p>I look at who&rsquo;s like trolling me in replies.</p>
<p>And inevitably it is a six month old account</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s following a hundred people</p>
<p>and has no followers or five followers.</p>
<p>And it has like some, you know,</p>
<p>large string of numbers at the end of the name.</p>
<p>Every time you say something,</p>
<p>every time I say something,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like every other comment is about a stock.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about a crypto thing that they want you to click on.</p>
<p>And so, you know, this last month</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started to experiment with turning comments off</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been the best because I can still communicate out.</p>
<p>It gets the same reach.</p>
<p>Millions of people will see what I have to say,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t have to deal.</p>
<p>And all of the other people that follow me</p>
<p>theoretically for useful information</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to deal with all of the bullshit</p>
<p>that comes with it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you can also pick, you should try.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a real problem on that platform</p>
<p>that needs to get fixed.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easily fixable because if you go to LinkedIn</p>
<p>or Facebook or Instagram, you don&rsquo;t see this.</p>
<p>So if the other platforms can figure it out</p>
<p>across many different companies,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s some secret sauce here.</p>
<p>You just have to put up, you know,</p>
<p>a couple of reasonable gates</p>
<p>and have some reasonable reporting</p>
<p>and you take a little friction out</p>
<p>and people will not be able to create bots on mass.</p>
<p>Yeah, I noticed that problem, you know,</p>
<p>in the early days of the Ukrainian war</p>
<p>when I would tweet out my opinion,</p>
<p>my contrarian opinions,</p>
<p>my non-consensus opinions on the Ukrainian war.</p>
<p>You get attacked.</p>
<p>I saw, I remember you were getting attacked.</p>
<p>Oh my God, it was ruthless.</p>
<p>Those are not real people.</p>
<p>Those are not real people.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>Those are algorithms.</p>
<p>Yeah, when you would go click on those accounts,</p>
<p>you would see that they were accounts created that month.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Zero followers, zero following,</p>
<p>and they were brand new accounts without any history.</p>
<p>And they were all tweeting the same thing,</p>
<p>accusing me of being devil Chamberlain.</p>
<p>It was all just, you know,</p>
<p>Putin talking points or whatever.</p>
<p>So there were, you know,</p>
<p>I think particularly when you speak out</p>
<p>against the current thing,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, you know, an organized effort</p>
<p>to try and drown you out.</p>
<p>And, but look,</p>
<p>the Washington Post had a story about this,</p>
<p>that Ukraine was really good</p>
<p>at what they called strategic communications.</p>
<p>Yeah, misinformation.</p>
<p>We used to call that propaganda,</p>
<p>but in any event, yeah, I mean, look,</p>
<p>there is absolutely a problem there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now a playbook.</p>
<p>If you, I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw the Zack Snyder</p>
<p>recut of Justice League,</p>
<p>supposedly there were bot armies</p>
<p>that put the pressure on Warner Brothers</p>
<p>to release his cut of that movie</p>
<p>and that he might have in some way been involved</p>
<p>was the insinuation.</p>
<p>And it actually drove commerce.</p>
<p>They gave him the whatever,</p>
<p>30, $40 million to recut the film.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s talk about markets</p>
<p>since that&rsquo;s what everybody really comes here for.</p>
<p>Looks like inflation is finally</p>
<p>maybe getting a little pushback gas</p>
<p>and oil is way down.</p>
<p>Big win for Americans</p>
<p>and obviously the administration.</p>
<p>There clearly is an upper bound</p>
<p>to how much people will pay for a gallon of gasoline.</p>
<p>Consumption is actually going down, which is interesting.</p>
<p>Human&rsquo;s pretty adaptable there.</p>
<p>Jobs, and we&rsquo;ve talked about this every month</p>
<p>as we watch it, finally dipped under 11 million</p>
<p>as Sachs predicted.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re gonna shed three or 400,000 jobs</p>
<p>it seems every month,</p>
<p>which should take this, you know,</p>
<p>10, 11 million number over the next year</p>
<p>down to maybe five or six,</p>
<p>which would still be an unbelievable number.</p>
<p>So put us at very robust, full employment,</p>
<p>which has been a big question.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a number of open job,</p>
<p>the number of job wrecks,</p>
<p>it went down by something like half a million in one month.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s been going down three or 400.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of been pretty consistent,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s clearly something going on here.</p>
<p>And the stock market, interestingly,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve started to see a little bump here,</p>
<p>even crypto, which the most speculative of all assets,</p>
<p>I guess, Bitcoin bounced as well,</p>
<p>you know, hitting 22, 23 now.</p>
<p>So what do you think Chamath about markets?</p>
<p>You may have called the bottom here on the program</p>
<p>a couple of months ago,</p>
<p>and I started J trading three weeks ago</p>
<p>based on our discussions here,</p>
<p>thinking we&rsquo;re bouncing along the bottom.</p>
<p>Is it a head fake right now?</p>
<p>I think at the time, initially,</p>
<p>I think I said, you know, it rallies to around 4,000.</p>
<p>I was a little off rally.</p>
<p>What rallies to 4,000?</p>
<p>The S&amp;P.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Probably gets to 4,200, 4,300.</p>
<p>Look, it&rsquo;s always important from my perspective.</p>
<p>Trading at 4,150 today, just so people know.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s always important from my perspective</p>
<p>to just take the other side</p>
<p>and just intellectually debate with oneself</p>
<p>why the other side could be right.</p>
<p>So at this point right now,</p>
<p>what people would say is,</p>
<p>okay, the Fed&rsquo;s gonna capitulate</p>
<p>at the beginning part of 2023.</p>
<p>We have a pretty clear forecast</p>
<p>for all the rate increases that have to happen.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s doing the work that&rsquo;s necessary,</p>
<p>either raising prices, cutting costs,</p>
<p>or doing both, letting people go, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So maybe we&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>Okay, so what&rsquo;s the other side of that?</p>
<p>Well, I think, again, as I&rsquo;ve stated before,</p>
<p>the other side starts with energy.</p>
<p>And the reason why I think it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>is that it really is the conflation of an economic system</p>
<p>and a political system using an instrument.</p>
<p>And if you look inside of what&rsquo;s happening in Europe,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of complexities here</p>
<p>that I think need to get unpacked.</p>
<p>So for example, a couple of days ago,</p>
<p>the French government basically said</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to start producing less nuclear energy.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d say, well, why would they do that?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out because the temperatures are so high,</p>
<p>you cannot use the water to cool these nuclear reactors</p>
<p>because the exiting water is then so hot</p>
<p>that it would actually destroy the ecosystem</p>
<p>of the lakes and rivers that they use</p>
<p>to feed natural fresh water in to cool the nuclear reactor.</p>
<p>Second, because it&rsquo;s so hot,</p>
<p>all the rivers are below their natural level,</p>
<p>barges that carry coal and that gas</p>
<p>are getting stuck on the Danube.</p>
<p>The Po, which is the longest river in Italy</p>
<p>that feeds all the fields,</p>
<p>actually is below the level where it can actually</p>
<p>offload the water.</p>
<p>So farmers can&rsquo;t basically do what they need to do</p>
<p>to produce a food supply.</p>
<p>So if you play all of that out,</p>
<p>you start to see an issue where by October,</p>
<p>November of this year,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re back into the same complexity</p>
<p>where energy is the tip of the spear</p>
<p>around which everybody starts to debate</p>
<p>all of the national security issues</p>
<p>that we have to deal with,</p>
<p>the Ukraine war, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve made a lot of money this year</p>
<p>by basically doing the following,</p>
<p>which is the exact opposite of everybody else.</p>
<p>When everybody else was freaking out,</p>
<p>had you bought, you would have made a ton of money.</p>
<p>Now everybody&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>And you can tell that by looking at the VIX,</p>
<p>which is the volatility index.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re about to get into the high teens.</p>
<p>You have systematically, it has been true</p>
<p>that when the VIX is in the teens,</p>
<p>you tend to basically buy volatility,</p>
<p>which is essentially you get short stocks.</p>
<p>And when the VIX is in the thirties,</p>
<p>you tend to basically sell volatility</p>
<p>and you buy equities because we&rsquo;ve hit the bottom.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been doing that for the last year,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve made a ton of money.</p>
<p>So there you have it.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen from here,</p>
<p>but I tend to think things still have to get a lot worse</p>
<p>to flush everything through the system.</p>
<p>And for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>the VIX is the ticker symbol that you can look up yourself</p>
<p>for the CBOE&rsquo;s volatility index,</p>
<p>which measures the stock market&rsquo;s expectation of volatility</p>
<p>based on the S&amp;P index&rsquo;s options trading.</p>
<p>If you look at oil, SACS,</p>
<p>we are now down to 87 bucks for a barrel.</p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t been here since, gosh, looks like,</p>
<p>yeah, February maybe.</p>
<p>And so, and gas prices plummeting,</p>
<p>something going well in this regard?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that particular commodity is coming down.</p>
<p>I still think we have a big inflation problem.</p>
<p>Why do you think it&rsquo;s going down?</p>
<p>I guess production&rsquo;s stepping up.</p>
<p>I mean, in response to higher prices,</p>
<p>people increase production and the price comes down.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, there&rsquo;s less demand.</p>
<p>The crazy sad thing about this whole thing with Biden</p>
<p>was that OPEC came back and they basically said,</p>
<p>we can increase like 600,000 barrels a day.</p>
<p>But the only two countries that are able to do it</p>
<p>were I think Kuwait and Saudi.</p>
<p>And the total number of barrels is about 100,000.</p>
<p>So with all the bluster and all of this stuff.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, actually.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no surprise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because the interest rate increases</p>
<p>are actually having an effect.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>You know, these rate increases are like chemotherapy.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s on the economy.</p>
<p>The gas demand is lower than the summer of 2020</p>
<p>in the middle of the pandemic in the United States.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>The commodity prices are reflecting expectations</p>
<p>that the economy is slowing down and, you know,</p>
<p>maybe in a recession.</p>
<p>So supply modestly up, demand massively down equals,</p>
<p>hey, we want to get people to buy this commodity</p>
<p>that will lower the prices.</p>
<p>Well, lo and behold, the same thing is happening</p>
<p>a little bit with groceries.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll see what happens with travel.</p>
<p>Homes also spectacularly falling down in price</p>
<p>and the inventory spiking as well.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your take here?</p>
<p>Unpack the 75 basis point increase in the chemotherapy</p>
<p>that you were going down that road.</p>
<p>Well, let me just speak to this rally</p>
<p>in the market for a second,</p>
<p>because I think there was a really interesting chart</p>
<p>that Philippe Lafon showed at that CO2 summit</p>
<p>that we talked about on the spot a few months ago.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just put it on the screen.</p>
<p>I put it in the chat.</p>
<p>What it basically shows is that during, you know,</p>
<p>protracted bear markets,</p>
<p>you can still get substantial bear market rallies.</p>
<p>And so during the 2000, 2001 dot-com crash,</p>
<p>you had these plus 32%, plus 41%, plus 45% rallies,</p>
<p>but even while the market as a whole was going down.</p>
<p>And so they ended up being sort of sucker rallies.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know if that is what&rsquo;s happening here,</p>
<p>but it is a possibility.</p>
<p>One interpretation, Sax, of this could be</p>
<p>people are picking the winning stocks</p>
<p>while the losers continue to lose.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s causing this, you know,</p>
<p>jagged edge or the dead cat bouncing, as they say,</p>
<p>which is what we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>in a lot of these public companies, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re watching, but Uber, you know,</p>
<p>obviously I&rsquo;m still a big shareholder,</p>
<p>had a massive print and other companies</p>
<p>have been doing equally as well, Apple included.</p>
<p>I think two things happened last week.</p>
<p>One is there were a number of companies</p>
<p>that reported good earnings.</p>
<p>And I think even more importantly, has strong forecasts.</p>
<p>So that helped.</p>
<p>And I think it was just,</p>
<p>there was so much pessimism and negativity</p>
<p>that just companies reporting decreases</p>
<p>that weren&rsquo;t as bad as people were expecting</p>
<p>created some room to move up.</p>
<p>But the other thing that drove the rally</p>
<p>is that the Fed made these comments</p>
<p>on the heels of that 75 basis point rate increase</p>
<p>that we were close to neutral.</p>
<p>And so the market seemed to get really optimistic</p>
<p>that we wouldn&rsquo;t get much more</p>
<p>in the way of rate increases.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;d be a 50 basis point rate increase</p>
<p>towards the end of the year,</p>
<p>which would bring the Fed funds rate</p>
<p>up to about the two-year bond rate.</p>
<p>So the idea was we&rsquo;re close to neutral</p>
<p>and markets really reacted to that.</p>
<p>The thing about that is though,</p>
<p>that I think what Powell and what the Fed says today</p>
<p>about rates is way less important</p>
<p>than what the inflation data will actually show</p>
<p>in a few months.</p>
<p>If we still have 9% inflation three months from now,</p>
<p>then I don&rsquo;t think the rate increases are done.</p>
<p>So at the end of the day,</p>
<p>I think that the data here is gonna be a lot more important</p>
<p>than what the Fed says,</p>
<p>because certainly the Fed has said a lot of things</p>
<p>over the past couple of years</p>
<p>that turned out not to be true.</p>
<p>You would agree they seem to be doing something correct</p>
<p>here with the 75 BPS,</p>
<p>you know, and taking it a little more seriously.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s having an impact.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say it again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it now five pods in a row.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never seen a moment in history, in American history,</p>
<p>where when CPI has printed successively above 5%,</p>
<p>that it got under 5% without Fed funds</p>
<p>getting to that same number.</p>
<p>So we should all hope that this is the exception</p>
<p>that proves the rule,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s an enormous amount of data</p>
<p>that would tell you that we have to take rates</p>
<p>to double what the equilibrium rate</p>
<p>is thought to be right now.</p>
<p>There was no print in August.</p>
<p>They take the month of August off.</p>
<p>They could do an emergency print,</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re expecting 50 or 75 BPS in September</p>
<p>if they do that.</p>
<p>Sachs, Chamath, Freeberg.</p>
<p>I think 50 is the expectation for September.</p>
<p>But look, I think it&rsquo;s appropriate now</p>
<p>after all the rate increase they&rsquo;ve done to take a pause.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna get two full months now of inflation data</p>
<p>before the September Fed meeting.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s appropriate to let the economy digest</p>
<p>these rate increases and see where we&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s see where the next two months inflation print</p>
<p>is, and then that&rsquo;ll determine what happens next.</p>
<p>Freeberg, based on all this,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your outlook for the economy?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s more&hellip;</p>
<p>We all try and be predictive</p>
<p>based on the current set of conditions in the world.</p>
<p>And there are a number of conditions in the world</p>
<p>that the switch could flip very quickly.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s enough of those triggering events right now</p>
<p>that the probability of any one or any set of them happening</p>
<p>in the next couple of months is probably pretty high.</p>
<p>You know, I kind of talked about it on the show</p>
<p>a few weeks ago that it&rsquo;s like a bunch of tortoises</p>
<p>sticking their head out of the shell.</p>
<p>And, you know, there&rsquo;s a few that might pop out here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s obviously a massive problem</p>
<p>with getting gas to Western Europe for this winter.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an emerging problem with food insecurity</p>
<p>in Africa, South Asia, around the world.</p>
<p>There is obviously continuing escalating conflict</p>
<p>in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>This NATO situation may or may not help.</p>
<p>The Taiwan visit may or may not help.</p>
<p>Is it escalating?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I think, you know, Sweden and whatnot joining NATO</p>
<p>is going to be viewed as provocatory.</p>
<p>And, you know, it could not make things cooler</p>
<p>and calmer over there, but make them more tense.</p>
<p>I mean, we view it as a security issue,</p>
<p>but it really is a conflict escalation issue.</p>
<p>And then I think that there are emerging markets problems.</p>
<p>You know, Argentina is facing 60% inflation.</p>
<p>Brazil has a criminal as their president right now.</p>
<p>And he has said publicly in the last couple of days</p>
<p>that he will not leave office if he loses the election</p>
<p>because the election is fraudulent.</p>
<p>And if that happens,</p>
<p>then you could see massive civil unrest.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been encouraging the population in Brazil</p>
<p>to go to the streets and fight back.</p>
<p>And there are a number of these flashpoints.</p>
<p>And by the way, that&rsquo;s a massive,</p>
<p>you know, food supplier,</p>
<p>as well as a massive holding in EM credit portfolios</p>
<p>around the world.</p>
<p>US consumer credit is a problem.</p>
<p>You know, we just had the largest number</p>
<p>of new credit card accounts open since 2008 in Q2</p>
<p>from the New York Fed report yesterday.</p>
<p>All of these things I&rsquo;m painting as pictures</p>
<p>of potential flashpoints</p>
<p>for what could quickly become wildfires or brush fires</p>
<p>that spread very quickly in markets</p>
<p>and could escalate some of the consideration.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t feel like I look around and say,</p>
<p>everything is good, we&rsquo;re in a good place.</p>
<p>There are some indications</p>
<p>that some of the stagflationary considerations</p>
<p>and concerns we may have had</p>
<p>in the way that markets are behaving right now</p>
<p>gives us a pause, gives us a respite, makes us feel okay.</p>
<p>But there are also a lot of things</p>
<p>that could go wrong.</p>
<p>And any one of those things could be a triggering point.</p>
<p>So I always think in terms of probabilities,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of low probability things.</p>
<p>But when you have enough low probability things,</p>
<p>the probability that something</p>
<p>in the set is triggered becomes high.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I kind of say, look,</p>
<p>the probability of something being a flashpoint</p>
<p>for us this year is high.</p>
<p>I also still think that globally,</p>
<p>we are very primed for conflict right now.</p>
<p>And we feel like,</p>
<p>and are hoping that the Russia Ukraine thing resolves,</p>
<p>but there are other points of escalation.</p>
<p>Look at what&rsquo;s happening with Pelosi visiting Taiwan.</p>
<p>Everyone that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>even well-informed is scratching their head saying,</p>
<p>what the heck is going on here?</p>
<p>There is currently an indulgence in conflict.</p>
<p>And I think that that indulgence will, you know,</p>
<p>cause more harm than good,</p>
<p>particularly for these financial markets</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re commenting on right now in the months ahead.</p>
<p>So look, you know, like I&rsquo;ve always said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to be one to time markets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like trying to time social behavior.</p>
<p>Like who&rsquo;s going to say some word first.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer in a population of people,</p>
<p>you know, you can kind of guess how people are gonna behave,</p>
<p>but markets are the output,</p>
<p>the manifestation of social behavior.</p>
<p>And so timing markets is very difficult.</p>
<p>I think you can do a good job analyzing businesses</p>
<p>and the quality of businesses</p>
<p>and how they will perform over time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that anyone over time</p>
<p>can do a good job timing markets.</p>
<p>And I think that there&rsquo;s a lot of these things</p>
<p>that could really shift anyone&rsquo;s perspective</p>
<p>on what you believe right now,</p>
<p>very rapidly in another direction,</p>
<p>based on any one of these things happening.</p>
<p>Chamath, do you feel the world is,</p>
<p>as Dr. Doom here is, you know, setting it up?</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;m not being negative.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just pointing out that there are a set of things</p>
<p>that could flip things the other way, right?</p>
<p>Absolutely, I&rsquo;m being slightly facetious here,</p>
<p>but you paint a pretty stark picture of,</p>
<p>hey, there&rsquo;s all these tipping points around the world.</p>
<p>Chamath, do you feel like this is how the world works?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always a bunch of potential tipping points.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always going to be wars, sadly,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s always going to be countries</p>
<p>that are dealing with dictators or insolvency,</p>
<p>especially in frontier markets and emerging markets,</p>
<p>or is this chaos really acute</p>
<p>and people should be anxious and in a panic?</p>
<p>I think both of you guys are right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always stuff going on in markets</p>
<p>and markets represent the collective sum</p>
<p>of our wishes and expectations and also the realities.</p>
<p>This is why I think, for me at least,</p>
<p>the way that I process this information</p>
<p>is not trying to have an opinion on any one of those things,</p>
<p>because I just, I find it too hard</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have enough depth of understanding</p>
<p>of any of those things.</p>
<p>For me, I&rsquo;d rather go back to the historical trends</p>
<p>because those, I find a little bit easier to parse</p>
<p>and whether any of those things are true</p>
<p>and baked into inflation right now or not.</p>
<p>Can they turn that radio down?</p>
<p>Jason, we&rsquo;re just docking something.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, no problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a little, we can&rsquo;t hear you, sorry.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>The second helicopter is replacing the first helicopter</p>
<p>because of a fuel leak issue on the first helicopter.</p>
<p>Oh, the helicopter pilots are swapping out.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>The helicopters are switching on the helicopters.</p>
<p>I mean, it takes a team to park this boat,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just be honest with you.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re trying to get it done, it&rsquo;s gonna be a little.</p>
<p>No, but listen, so the real problem is that like,</p>
<p>if I go back to the historical artifacts,</p>
<p>have there been issues in the past,</p>
<p>the way that, you know, Freeberg described?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So this is why I think you can look at the fact</p>
<p>that whenever there&rsquo;s inflation and whenever it&rsquo;s spiked,</p>
<p>this is what has had to happen by the Fed</p>
<p>is you have to take rates above that key 5% threshold</p>
<p>when CPI is above 5% to break enough demand</p>
<p>so that the economy&rsquo;s reset.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s where we are.</p>
<p>So instead of trying to figure out whether, you know,</p>
<p>I mean, the Brazil thing as an example</p>
<p>that Freeberg said is crazy.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s basically, you know,</p>
<p>he said publicly in a press release,</p>
<p>the army&rsquo;s on my side and it&rsquo;s ready to help me,</p>
<p>you know, keep in staying, just the craziest thing.</p>
<p>So what are you supposed to do?</p>
<p>The fighters need to take to the streets.</p>
<p>So what are you supposed to do?</p>
<p>In my opinion, I&rsquo;m like, you know what?</p>
<p>A version of Brazil has happened before.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know enough history, quite honest,</p>
<p>to know the specifics of what happened then</p>
<p>and how that could translate to now.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t wanna spend the time understanding</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s gonna happen in Brazil right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather just say there are 20 or 30 things</p>
<p>that could very much complicate the world economy.</p>
<p>I think the reality is that governments need</p>
<p>to flush all this excess money out of the system</p>
<p>so that we can really find out what equilibrium demand is</p>
<p>and get back to normal.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also, by the way, a really important trend, Chamath,</p>
<p>on like, that I think is playing out</p>
<p>and will play out for the next decade on deglobalization.</p>
<p>So as the US tries to build</p>
<p>its own semiconductor manufacturing capacity,</p>
<p>as China loses key trade partners,</p>
<p>as all of these markets stop trading with each other</p>
<p>and start to build redundancy,</p>
<p>there is a massive, longer-range economic effect</p>
<p>of deglobalization.</p>
<p>Globalization enables efficient pricing.</p>
<p>It enables labor and energy and everything to be done,</p>
<p>you know, to go to the cheapest source.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way globalization has benefited us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been able to get cheap energy and cheap labor</p>
<p>in overseas markets to do work for us.</p>
<p>And as a result, we&rsquo;ve gotten access to cheap products.</p>
<p>So when you deglobalize,</p>
<p>you end up having to pay more for labor, more for energy.</p>
<p>You have to build infrastructure,</p>
<p>and the price for everything goes up.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve said this on the pod for two years now.</p>
<p>That era of cheaper, faster, better is over.</p>
<p>And what comes with that is better national security,</p>
<p>but the cost of that better national security</p>
<p>is higher prices.</p>
<p>Higher prices, less growth.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing that we can do to avoid that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I agree with the less growth.</p>
<p>I actually think that there&rsquo;s enough excess slack</p>
<p>to be absorbed by all of this free money</p>
<p>that I think you can still have sustained growth,</p>
<p>but it will come with higher interest rates</p>
<p>and higher inflation and higher input costs.</p>
<p>Everybody will have to do their part to absorb some of this,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>And I think we should just deal with the medicine</p>
<p>as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>This is why the people that actually think</p>
<p>that the Fed should just be very aggressive</p>
<p>and get this over with quickly,</p>
<p>I suspect on the margins are right.</p>
<p>The problem is they don&rsquo;t want to look</p>
<p>at the historical artifact</p>
<p>because the historical artifact would say,</p>
<p>wait, I need to raise interest rates</p>
<p>by another 250 basis points.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just way too disruptive</p>
<p>for what the world is ready to hear right now.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to incrementally plot along.</p>
<p>And I think what Friedberg says is right,</p>
<p>which is that there&rsquo;s going to be a whack-a-mole that emerges.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to tilt the markets.</p>
<p>Then the consumer credit thing will implode.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to tilt the markets.</p>
<p>Then Jair Bolsonaro will try to take over Brazil.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll tilt the markets and we&rsquo;ll go back</p>
<p>to this inflationary, fragmented,</p>
<p>de-globalized view of the world</p>
<p>that just frankly takes higher interest rates to normalize.</p>
<p>All right, and Sax, I&rsquo;ll bring you on this.</p>
<p>I mean, counter to Friedberg&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>the counter obviously would be,</p>
<p>hey, we will have less dependency on dictators</p>
<p>like Putin, Xi Jinping, MBS, et cetera.</p>
<p>And that would be great for humanity</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d have resiliency in our supply chain.</p>
<p>And the West now becoming unified,</p>
<p>say what you will about the NATO membership</p>
<p>and the timing of it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably a great thing that the West is saying,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re going to get together as a group,</p>
<p>I think you would agree,</p>
<p>and stand against dictators invading other countries.</p>
<p>And if everybody pays their fair share to be part of NATO,</p>
<p>which is an important point-</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not what they said.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what they said.</p>
<p>Well, it is a fair point.</p>
<p>Well, I mean-</p>
<p>No, that is not, but be intellectually honest.</p>
<p>We all said the first part.</p>
<p>Which is?</p>
<p>And nobody talked about that second part.</p>
<p>And the only person who,</p>
<p>which is Josh Hawley,</p>
<p>who is not exactly my favorite person in the world,</p>
<p>but maybe Sax wants to comment,</p>
<p>was the only one that actually said,</p>
<p>which is probably the fair thing,</p>
<p>which Jason, you are saying is part of the deal,</p>
<p>it is not part of the deal.</p>
<p>No, no, it should be part of the deal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying it should be part of the deal.</p>
<p>And for people who missed what we said there,</p>
<p>United States spends three and a half percent</p>
<p>of our GDP on military.</p>
<p>Other places in NATO might be spending one or 2%,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re trying to get them all to 2%</p>
<p>to be a little closer to us.</p>
<p>And then this obviously trip to Taiwan,</p>
<p>strengthening our relationship with that country,</p>
<p>but at what cost and why are we doing it now,</p>
<p>all come into play here, so.</p>
<p>Do you actually think that this trip to Taiwan</p>
<p>actually strengthened our relationship with Taiwan?</p>
<p>Did we come out with a deal for chips</p>
<p>that DSNC all of a sudden said?</p>
<p>In what way?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious.</p>
<p>Well, because they are, I mean,</p>
<p>did you not see their statements and giving Pelosi awards?</p>
<p>And Taiwan very much wants to strengthen</p>
<p>their relationship with the West.</p>
<p>That is their goal.</p>
<p>They want to strengthen the West.</p>
<p>They want the protection of the West.</p>
<p>So yes, it&rsquo;s trying to-</p>
<p>Do you think that this was a coordinated-</p>
<p>Hold on, let me finish.</p>
<p>It does strengthen our relationship with Taiwan.</p>
<p>The question is, does it provoke China?</p>
<p>And was it necessary at this point in time in history</p>
<p>when the world does feel like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit of a powder keg?</p>
<p>No, but so six months from now,</p>
<p>when all the fruits and vegetables</p>
<p>that have been embargoed and not sent to Taiwan,</p>
<p>and then the sand that allows them to make chips</p>
<p>continues to not flow,</p>
<p>do you think that they&rsquo;ll still be positive</p>
<p>about the trip?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to Sax.</p>
<p>He likes to comment on these things, so.</p>
<p>All right, well-</p>
<p>I want to break Saxon.</p>
<p>I want to dismantle everything you just said.</p>
<p>I know, that&rsquo;s why I set you up for it.</p>
<p>So on Pelosi, I mean, look,</p>
<p>once it came out that Pelosi was going to Taiwan</p>
<p>and China threatened her and the US saying you can&rsquo;t go,</p>
<p>obviously we couldn&rsquo;t back down from that</p>
<p>because we can&rsquo;t let China dictate</p>
<p>which of our officials can go to Taiwan.</p>
<p>So at that point, we had to back her play.</p>
<p>And you saw that everybody from Fox News</p>
<p>to 25 Republican senators got on board, okay?</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the issue.</p>
<p>The real issue is, should she even have been going?</p>
<p>I think this trip was self-indulgent.</p>
<p>It was reckless.</p>
<p>She was told by the Biden administration,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t go, this is not the right time.</p>
<p>This is a sensitive time.</p>
<p>The CCP&rsquo;s got their party conference</p>
<p>in the next couple of months.</p>
<p>There was no reason to basically provoke</p>
<p>this showdown right now.</p>
<p>And she just dismissed what the administration,</p>
<p>Biden and what the Pentagon told her to do</p>
<p>because she wanted to make some sort</p>
<p>of valedictory tour to Taiwan.</p>
<p>So look, Nancy Pelosi does not deserve</p>
<p>any credit for this trip.</p>
<p>Did we have to defend her once China threatened her?</p>
<p>Yes, of course, we had to, like I said, back her play,</p>
<p>but this was reckless and it was self-indulgent</p>
<p>and it didn&rsquo;t need to happen.</p>
<p>And it really makes you wonder</p>
<p>who is calling the shots in this administration</p>
<p>when Pelosi won&rsquo;t even respect the wishes</p>
<p>of a president in her own party.</p>
<p>And what is she doing going over there?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not the secretary of state.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not the president.</p>
<p>Had the same questions, like why now?</p>
<p>Why now?</p>
<p>Thomas Friedman had, well, because it&rsquo;s all about her</p>
<p>making this valedictory tour before.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s gonna hand over the gavel.</p>
<p>Look, the Democrats are gonna lose the House in November.</p>
<p>Once she passes the gavel to a new Republican speaker</p>
<p>of the House, I think she&rsquo;ll be announcing</p>
<p>her retirement shortly after that.</p>
<p>So this is all part of her farewell tour.</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t need to happen.</p>
<p>And the fact that she did it in violation of the wishes</p>
<p>of a president of her own party makes you wonder</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s calling the shots over there.</p>
<p>And it kind of reminded me, you know, a few weeks ago,</p>
<p>Gavin Newsom was over at the White House</p>
<p>when Biden was over in Europe and everyone was speculating,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s he doing over there?</p>
<p>Is he measuring the drapes?</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s measuring the drapes.</p>
<p>So, you know, it just goes to show</p>
<p>does this administration have control over anything,</p>
<p>over the members of their own party?</p>
<p>Over 60% of Democrats say they want someone different</p>
<p>to run in 24.</p>
<p>So yes, there was a surface level of consensus</p>
<p>and backing of Pelosi.</p>
<p>But if you scratch beneath the surface,</p>
<p>you see that the trip was unnecessary</p>
<p>and reveals a president who doesn&rsquo;t seem completely</p>
<p>in control of our foreign policy.</p>
<p>So in a statement, almost universally,</p>
<p>the leadership of the Republican Party said,</p>
<p>for decades, members of the US, United States Congress,</p>
<p>including previous speakers of the house</p>
<p>have traveled to Taiwan.</p>
<p>This travel is consistent with the United States</p>
<p>one China policy to which we are committed.</p>
<p>We are also committed now more than ever</p>
<p>to all elements of the Taiwan Relations Act.</p>
<p>So one China, if you don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>is that Taiwan and China are all part of one unified entity.</p>
<p>So the Republicans seem to be supporting this</p>
<p>in a cynical way, you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>or it is consistent that other members</p>
<p>of the United States Congress have gone</p>
<p>including other speakers of the house.</p>
<p>I think there is bipartisan support now to defend Taiwan.</p>
<p>I actually think that that is in the cards.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a very high probability</p>
<p>that we actually end up in a war with China.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>This century. Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I think Taiwan is the biggest flashpoint in the world.</p>
<p>I would agree with that.</p>
<p>But explain why you think there&rsquo;s going to be a war</p>
<p>because I think a lot of people think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s way too much at stake here</p>
<p>for there to be a war.</p>
<p>So there is going to be some sort of negotiated settlement</p>
<p>in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>So why would you think you think the majority case</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s going to be a war really?</p>
<p>You have to look at it first of all,</p>
<p>from the Chinese point of view,</p>
<p>they view Taiwan as sacred territory.</p>
<p>And for decades now, they have said in every single meeting,</p>
<p>diplomatic meeting with the US,</p>
<p>Taiwan is always their number one issue.</p>
<p>They are hell bent on</p>
<p>recent reunification of mainland China with Taiwan.</p>
<p>And they would like to do it peacefully</p>
<p>through coercion if they can,</p>
<p>but I think they will do it militarily if they must.</p>
<p>And the only question is when they feel</p>
<p>that they will be strong enough</p>
<p>to basically take the island by force.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I think, the Chinese point of view.</p>
<p>And I think America is increasingly committed</p>
<p>to the defense of Taiwan.</p>
<p>So, you know, we have contradictory statements on this.</p>
<p>The one China policy says that we respect</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s one China,</p>
<p>but on the other hand,</p>
<p>the Taiwan Relations Act commits us</p>
<p>to help in the defense of Taiwan.</p>
<p>So we have a contradictory policy on this,</p>
<p>but if you really want to understand-</p>
<p>And by the way, as does Sachs, you would agree,</p>
<p>China has flip-flopped on this.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s only the last hundred years</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve really considered Taiwan strategic.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t care about it two or 300 years ago.</p>
<p>They were kind of like, this is worthless.</p>
<p>You guys do what you want.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because Taiwan was part of China until 1895,</p>
<p>when Japan took it from them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They have been-</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t want it at that time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other thing.</p>
<p>They were like, this is worthless real estate.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only-</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Taiwan is extremely important strategically.</p>
<p>And if you want to understand why,</p>
<p>I think you need to look at this map of the island chains.</p>
<p>Can we pull that up, actually?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a really interesting discussion</p>
<p>because 200 years ago, they didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden they were like, wait a second,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re going to be in wars with the West</p>
<p>and Japan&rsquo;s going to be a democracy,</p>
<p>we do actually have something at stake here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d like that island back.</p>
<p>The island chain strategy was originally created</p>
<p>by John Foster Dulles.</p>
<p>This one of the, Secretary of State,</p>
<p>I think under Eisenhower,</p>
<p>who was one of the initial architects</p>
<p>of our containment policy against the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>but also came up with this idea</p>
<p>of how we would contain China in East Asia.</p>
<p>And the basic idea is that China is surrounded</p>
<p>by a series of island chains.</p>
<p>The first island chain goes down</p>
<p>from the Southern tip of Japan to Okinawa,</p>
<p>to Taiwan, to I think there&rsquo;s some islands</p>
<p>in the South China Sea, the Spratly Islands.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got the Northwest tip of the Philippines.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first island chain.</p>
<p>Second island chain goes out to the Eastern part</p>
<p>of the Philippines.</p>
<p>No, Vietnam&rsquo;s all the way down in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>But I think the second island chain includes,</p>
<p>you know, it goes down to Indonesia.</p>
<p>And then I think there&rsquo;s even a third island chain</p>
<p>that includes Guam.</p>
<p>Although Guam actually might be in the second,</p>
<p>somewhere around there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a heavily fortified American base.</p>
<p>So the idea is if you want to bottle up and contain China,</p>
<p>you do it by controlling these island chains.</p>
<p>And Taiwan is really the central one.</p>
<p>It sort of divides this East China Sea</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve got South Korea and Japan</p>
<p>from the South China Sea,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve got Vietnam and Malaysia.</p>
<p>If we distance between Vietnam and Japan,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s literally, if you were to draw a center line</p>
<p>of China&rsquo;s coastal access, that is it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the bottom line is this.</p>
<p>If you want to pursue a policy of containment</p>
<p>against China, you really want to control</p>
<p>these island chains.</p>
<p>Another way to think about it is that these islands</p>
<p>are unsinkable aircraft carriers.</p>
<p>They allow America to project power 6,000 miles away</p>
<p>into the Pacific.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we saw it during World War II</p>
<p>is we had all these island hopping battles.</p>
<p>And as we took these islands,</p>
<p>they would then become a runway for the next stage of,</p>
<p>to project American power to get all the way to Japan.</p>
<p>So, you know, if you believe that we&rsquo;re headed for,</p>
<p>or we already are in Cold War II with China,</p>
<p>and I think we are.</p>
<p>I think China is really the geopolitical threat,</p>
<p>not Russia.</p>
<p>The way that you would contain China</p>
<p>and keep them bottled up is to have these islands</p>
<p>in the American alliance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be very hard for China,</p>
<p>which is now building a huge blue water Navy,</p>
<p>has actually more ships than the United States.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be very hard for them to project their power</p>
<p>all over the world if they are contained and bottled up</p>
<p>and have to watch their own backs.</p>
<p>One note on the number of ships though,</p>
<p>in East Asia is, you know, they have a lot of small ships.</p>
<p>The tonnage wise, we have much more tonnage.</p>
<p>And if you were to look, you know, even the perfect setup,</p>
<p>as you explained through these islands</p>
<p>is very similar to NATO and what&rsquo;s happening with Russia.</p>
<p>You know, we have Korea, we have Japan,</p>
<p>we have Vietnam, the Philippines,</p>
<p>we have an incredible alliance in this area.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a great thing for America.</p>
<p>And Taiwan obviously is a jump ball here.</p>
<p>But this is a setup for China, you know, having&hellip;</p>
<p>Jason, what do you think about the repercussions</p>
<p>of her visit?</p>
<p>So CATL, which is Tesla&rsquo;s biggest battery supplier,</p>
<p>basically, you know, delayed the announcement of a factory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear whether they&rsquo;re gonna put it</p>
<p>into the United States.</p>
<p>They may actually pick a city in Mexico.</p>
<p>But the decision that was supposed to happen now</p>
<p>has now been delayed until September or October.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all of these crazy military drills that happened.</p>
<p>Was it all worth it?</p>
<p>I mean, that is the question.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m asking why now?</p>
<p>Was it worth it?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have enough information, I think,</p>
<p>to know why this was done now.</p>
<p>Was it a freelance?</p>
<p>Hold on, he asked me a question.</p>
<p>Let me finish.</p>
<p>Is it a freelance and Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s completely freelance</p>
<p>or is there a bigger strategy here is the question.</p>
<p>Is China weak now?</p>
<p>Are we trying to send a message to them?</p>
<p>And one could equally take the side of the argument</p>
<p>that the United States supporting Finland,</p>
<p>supporting Sweden, supporting NATO,</p>
<p>you know, supporting the Ukraine</p>
<p>and supporting the Pacific is actually the right move here</p>
<p>to contain the dictators.</p>
<p>I agree, but we have a, I agree,</p>
<p>but we have two people to do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the president and the secretary of state.</p>
<p>Well, that would be a much bigger provocation,</p>
<p>I think is the issue.</p>
<p>So if you sent the president,</p>
<p>that would be a very big provocation.</p>
<p>The Thomas Friedman article that Saks mentions</p>
<p>was pretty explicit that, you know,</p>
<p>Blinken and Biden both told her, please stand down.</p>
<p>Yeah, the NSC and the joint chief said, please stand down.</p>
<p>You are way over your ski tips here.</p>
<p>And she said,</p>
<p>I agree, I agree.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been very public.</p>
<p>What is the point of doing this now?</p>
<p>Is the question.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t have information.</p>
<p>Once China tried to dictate to Pelosi that she couldn&rsquo;t go,</p>
<p>of course we had to back her play,</p>
<p>but you have to be kind of a fool</p>
<p>to fall for this in the first place.</p>
<p>This was self-indulgent by Pelosi.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t need to pick this battle.</p>
<p>The administration asked her not to.</p>
<p>And look, let me give Biden some credit here.</p>
<p>Biden has the right policy on Taiwan,</p>
<p>which was stated this way.</p>
<p>He says that we support the status quo</p>
<p>and we are against unilateral changes to the status quo.</p>
<p>We want the United States to be a status quo power</p>
<p>with respect to Taiwan</p>
<p>and force China to be the revisionist power.</p>
<p>And we need to be very careful</p>
<p>that we do not come across as the revisionist power</p>
<p>that would give China an excuse.</p>
<p>So we want to just maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>That should be our policy.</p>
<p>All right, everybody, we&rsquo;ll see you next time</p>
<p>on the All In Pod.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>‚ô™ I&rsquo;m going all in ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Let your winners ride ‚ô™</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Sachs.</p>
<p>‚ô™ I&rsquo;m going all in ‚ô™</p>
<p>And instead, we open-sourced it to the fans</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you, Estes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the queen of Kinwan.</p>
<p>‚ô™ I&rsquo;m going all in ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Let your winners ride ‚ô™</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>I hope they&rsquo;re not that bad.</p>
<p>That is my dog taking a notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>Sachs.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room</p>
<p>and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension</p>
<p>that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>Let your beat be.</p>
<p>Let your beat be.</p>
<p>Let your beat be.</p>
<p>Let your beat be.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
