<p>good morning everyone we have Karen here</p>
<p>and spirit and she&rsquo;ll be asking me</p>
<p>questions but she&rsquo;ll be here next week</p>
<p>we have a lot of callers we have a lot</p>
<p>of questions in social media so</p>
<p>definitely we&rsquo;ll rapidly get through</p>
<p>your questions anything that I say is</p>
<p>not meant to diagnose you or even cure</p>
<p>you because that&rsquo;s illegal in the state</p>
<p>of Virginia of course we&rsquo;re in Maryland</p>
<p>so if you happen to be cured don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mention our name because we can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>that here all right so let&rsquo;s jump right</p>
<p>to the caller&rsquo;s rows for you from New</p>
<p>York City you had a question go ahead hi</p>

<p>is because of kovat and we have to watch</p>
<p>how much we you know spend and what we</p>
<p>pick for food um he has a sensitive</p>
<p>stomach and he&rsquo;s lactose intolerant</p>
<p>he says that he can&rsquo;t even have like</p>
<p>coconut any coconut products and he</p>
<p>takes those pills you know and they</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t been working so I think he had</p>
<p>he might have to double up that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>my my cousin&rsquo;s say but they&rsquo;re experts</p>
<p>supposedly at it</p>
<p>um so my question is like two parts so</p>
<p>the first part is from the shakes that</p>
<p>you offer what they what&rsquo;s okay for him</p>
<p>to drink you know for a vegetable</p>
<p>replacement and also what sugar can he</p>
<p>you know because I tried monk fruit and</p>
<p>he he kind of had a reaction from that</p>
<p>so what kind of sugars can yield so have</p>
<p>a substitute right well you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>find that as he does keto and in a</p>
<p>minute fasting especially over time</p>
<p>these sensitivities will get better and</p>
<p>better and better but in the meantime</p>
<p>lactose is in the milk product so</p>
<p>anything with milk you might have to</p>
<p>avoid now realize too that the longer</p>
<p>that cheese is aged the more that</p>
<p>lactose is</p>
<p>eaten up by the bacteria so there&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>low amounts of lactose in cheese however</p>
<p>if you have sensitivities it could be</p>
<p>allergic to the casein in the cheese the</p>
<p>protein in the cheese so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something you have to watch now as far</p>
<p>as coconut oil and things like that if</p>
<p>you sensitive to that that&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>a lack of bile so yes you want a</p>
<p>double-double up on that take two two or</p>
<p>maybe even three of the gallbladder</p>
<p>support after he eats but the other</p>
<p>thing that will help release his own</p>
<p>bile is his stomach acids so I would</p>
<p>definitely add in there some some</p>
<p>digestive formula before he eats or</p>
<p>maybe some episode of vinegar pertaining</p>
<p>to chloride just to kind of acidify the</p>
<p>stomach now let&rsquo;s say you do all that</p>
<p>and you still have a problem then he</p>
<p>probably also needs enzymes because</p>
<p>think about this bile breaks down the</p>
<p>fat to a certain level but then the</p>
<p>pancreas releases lipase which is an</p>
<p>enzyme to take into the completely to</p>
<p>the smallest level so it might need he</p>
<p>might need also pancreatic enzymes</p>
<p>specifically lipase to really put this</p>
<p>in good put them in good shape</p>
<p>and then the other question as far as</p>
<p>the shake I think the the part of the</p>
<p>safest thing that I have for people with</p>
<p>sensitive stomach would be the veggie</p>
<p>solution because that has a very high</p>
<p>quality green in there that you can have</p>
<p>it tastes pretty good because it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little touch of stevia and a little bit</p>
<p>of flavoring but that one usually makes</p>
<p>everyone feel really really good so I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;ll be safe with that as far as</p>
<p>a shake in a veggie alternative but I</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s going to just have to start</p>
<p>consuming foods like one at a time like</p>
<p>the worst the digestive system is or the</p>
<p>more sensitivities you have the more you</p>
<p>want to just do like one food okay wait</p>
<p>a little bit add another food versus</p>
<p>mixing everything together just to</p>
<p>really help this system alright Rose</p>
<p>thanks for your question</p>
<p>all right so let&rsquo;s go to Jenny from New</p>
<p>York</p>
<p>are you there Jenny hi I am oh yeah</p>
<p>great thanks</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;m so I&rsquo;ve been doing for a couple</p>
<p>months and I&rsquo;m using into you know keep</p>
<p>those diet going well but I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>breaking out along the jaw lines and I</p>
<p>thought it was the HEA that I was taking</p>
<p>so I stopped that and I thought your EIN</p>
<p>product and I&rsquo;ve been I&rsquo;m on my second</p>
<p>bottle of that and I&rsquo;m taking you know I</p>
<p>have a topic that I&rsquo;m using like retin-a</p>
<p>and stuff like that but I&rsquo;m freaking out</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand I&rsquo;m young so unbreak</p>
<p>it out I don&rsquo;t know I need that I&rsquo;m only</p>
<p>got a packet so yeah yeah so you&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>basically saying you&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>through puberty it&rsquo;s more of a possibly</p>
<p>a menopausal pre menopausal type thing</p>
<p>right well here&rsquo;s some things here</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re yes like cystic acne could come</p>
<p>from astringent dominance for sure if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking dim which is a</p>
<p>concentrated cruciferous and it didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get rid of your acne then we know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something else there&rsquo;s a couple of</p>
<p>things about acne that I especially if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not fully on keto there&rsquo;s a thing</p>
<p>called polycystic ovarian syndrome which</p>
<p>basically is a high level of androgens</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the other hormone that can cause</p>
<p>acne definitely in premenopausal acne so</p>
<p>I would definitely get on keto more</p>
<p>strictly to bring your carbs down</p>
<p>because that excess insulin will convert</p>
<p>to androgens and cause acne now let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say you do that and you still have acne</p>
<p>then we we know it could be something</p>
<p>else related to either dairy which is</p>
<p>another contributor to inflammation and</p>
<p>acne or fluoride in the water supply if</p>
<p>you just get a um and this is so such a</p>
<p>simple no-brainer you put this little</p>
<p>filter on your shower</p>
<p>and of course drinking water as well to</p>
<p>get the fluoride out I have a whole</p>
<p>house filter for chloride chlorine as</p>
<p>well as fluoride is huge one and oh my</p>
<p>gosh your skin quality little acne stuff</p>
<p>just completely goes bye-bye so those</p>
<p>are some things that I would look at and</p>
<p>I think well that will solve it right</p>
<p>there thanks for your call Jenny all</p>
<p>right and you know Steve since we&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>the topic of acne Steve what is the the</p>
<p>number one reason why patients go to</p>
<p>doctors to cure acne you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually correct oh my I don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>you guessed that but it&rsquo;s skin disorders</p>
<p>and acne is the top one that&rsquo;s why so a</p>
<p>lot of people are going for skin issues</p>
<p>I mean I remember I was like driving to</p>
<p>Florida and I was like at every corner</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a dermatologist I&rsquo;m like what is</p>
<p>going on here a lot of skin issues</p>
<p>interesting well my beautiful complexion</p>
<p>is spared from that yeah quite Steen it</p>
<p>was pretty bad</p>
<p>hey join a club I had a lot of skin</p>
<p>problems too little did I know at that</p>
<p>time that sugar was really a big big</p>
<p>problem hey Susan you&rsquo;re from California</p>
<p>you had a question go ahead yes I did</p>
<p>Bob ensign for pain I take a lot of them</p>
<p>24 a day I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 25 years</p>
<p>and it works better than my and</p>
<p>everything</p>
<p>what enzyme you take me what type of</p>
<p>enzyme you take again it&rsquo;s dying yes yes</p>
<p>okay good and I used to take I option it</p>
<p>works better than Vioxx so I just want</p>
<p>to know if that&rsquo;s gonna mess with me um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to start taking down but I just</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t seem to do it okay well that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really simple answer because yeah that</p>
<p>product has absolutely no side effects</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s totally natural you can do that all</p>
<p>that long without any problem at all</p>
<p>so I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about that at all</p>
<p>but what I would also look at for if you</p>
<p>have pain or inflammation especially</p>
<p>within the nervous system and the spine</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where you have it the</p>
<p>vitamin D is probably one of the best</p>
<p>things as well as fasting you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably already trying that but if you</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t fasting and vitamin D are my</p>
<p>go-to for inflammatory conditions</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s inflammation like</p>
<p>stenosis type stuff of the spinal column</p>
<p>so many people have that yeah so yeah</p>
<p>thanks for your call so Steve um so you</p>
<p>know there&rsquo;s still some things in the</p>
<p>news about how dangerous high-fat diets</p>
<p>are and I want to just mention that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a real interesting video that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be doing on on the immune</p>
<p>system and how to strengthen probably</p>
<p>the most important immune cell which I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to do a video on which you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to learn real quick next week and</p>
<p>as I was researching this one of the</p>
<p>things they said that worsens this</p>
<p>immune cell is a high-fat diet so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like wait a second let&rsquo;s take a look at</p>
<p>that that study that they&rsquo;re quoting so</p>
<p>there is of course on mice right and</p>
<p>mice live on high-fat diets so we know</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s connected so then I find out</p>
<p>the the mice Chow that they were</p>
<p>consuming and it&rsquo;s from bioserve F three</p>
<p>to six or eight - right so I look at</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a high-fat diet for a mouse diet</p>
<p>and then I look at wait a second what is</p>
<p>this little thing it says carbohydrates</p>
<p>36.7% 36.7% carbs in this high-fat diet</p>
<p>now Steve roughly do you know the</p>
<p>percentage of carbs that you&rsquo;re supposed</p>
<p>to be within when you&rsquo;re doing keto do</p>
<p>you do you know that day about 20 right</p>
<p>actually that&rsquo;s protein excuse me okay</p>
<p>carbs should be 5 percent 5 percent yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re close but okay so the mice were</p>
<p>on donuts</p>
<p>the mice were unknown &lsquo;it&rsquo;s and so that</p>
<p>you know the ingredients in this mice</p>
<p>food this high-fat diet</p>
<p>lard casein which is probably the worst</p>
<p>protein it&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s from China as well</p>
<p>malted dextran which is the worst sugar</p>
<p>sucrose but then they have some</p>
<p>synthetic vitamins in there so and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re using as their data</p>
<p>to tell people that high-fat diets are</p>
<p>dangerous useless data yeah so I would</p>
<p>say you know if you&rsquo;re gonna feed your</p>
<p>mice make sure you don&rsquo;t put them on</p>
<p>that that that program right there okay</p>
<p>by the way I think we should check in</p>
<p>now that Karen is invisible I will speak</p>
<p>for her and we wanted everyone to know</p>
<p>that we have viewers checking in from</p>
<p>Iraq from London from Cairo Albania</p>
<p>Boston Serbia Canada Nigeria Cyprus and</p>
<p>Japan that&rsquo;s just fantastic</p>
<p>how many people all over the world from</p>
<p>every nationality and background want to</p>
<p>stay healthy that&rsquo;s great when you have</p>
<p>some questions just I&rsquo;m ready for you</p>
<p>okay okay we&rsquo;ve got some so on Facebook</p>
<p>Kelly has leg cramps and she wants to</p>
<p>know what sort of treatment without a</p>
<p>cure that you might yeah okay</p>
<p>what would we put potentially recommend</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re not going to try to cure her of</p>
<p>those leg cramps if you&rsquo;re in Quito the</p>
<p>the biggest thing that pops up for leg</p>
<p>cramps would be potassium or magnesium</p>
<p>deficiency especially if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>keto that will usually handle it like</p>
<p>that but it could also be a problem with</p>
<p>some calcium issues but usually not but</p>
<p>it could so you may want it to take</p>
<p>something that has all the electrolytes</p>
<p>the other thing you know that&rsquo;s an a</p>
<p>rare situation to be you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re low</p>
<p>in vitamin E and that can cause leg</p>
<p>cramps as well so those are the those</p>
<p>are the things that I would look at and</p>
<p>the other thing too is if you ever hear</p>
<p>about people have a little twitching and</p>
<p>then with the left eye or this little</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>yeah that is a calcium buildup because</p>
<p>your pH is off see you too alkaline you</p>
<p>need to acidify your body with apple</p>
<p>cider vinegar okay speaking of balance</p>
<p>we need to go to youtube questions and</p>
<p>andreas is that right andreas wants to</p>
<p>know how she can adjust or macros well</p>
<p>she can adjust it going to a</p>
<p>chiropractor that will actually give you</p>
<p>a good adjustment but the macros you</p>
<p>want to get 5% carbs 20% protein now</p>
<p>that gives us 25 right and then the rest</p>
<p>fat so that&rsquo;s 75% but I&rsquo;m but I would</p>
<p>actually do 70% fat okay and then an</p>
<p>extra 5% purely vegetable carbs why</p>
<p>first of all 5% of your whole diet on an</p>
<p>average of 1,800 calories per day 5</p>
<p>percent of that vegetable would give you</p>
<p>about 7 to 10 cups of vegetable because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s hardly any carbs and vegetables</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re not even counting the carbs in</p>
<p>in the we&rsquo;re not counting the vegetables</p>
<p>in the carb</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re actually counting them as an extra</p>
<p>thing that you don&rsquo;t have to worry about</p>
<p>it we want to include that so that would</p>
<p>be the macros 5% carbs 5% vegetables the</p>
<p>other vegetables in salads and then 20%</p>
<p>protein and 70 percent fat but realize</p>
<p>the fat has more than double the</p>
<p>calories what does that mean it means by</p>
<p>volume you&rsquo;re not going to be doing like</p>
<p>70 percent by volume it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>buying calories so if you look at a</p>
<p>plate it&rsquo;s really 25 percent of that</p>
<p>plate being fat and we&rsquo;re not talking a</p>
<p>stick of butter we&rsquo;re talking about the</p>
<p>fat that is within the protein that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating so like if you have you</p>
<p>ever have hamburger Steve just had</p>
<p>meatloaf yeah well you&rsquo;re gonna actually</p>
<p>have in that hamburger it maybe it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll sell it like 90 percent 70% you</p>
<p>want to buy the fattiest hamburger you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to buy ninety percent but at</p>
<p>7 percent that&rsquo;s a 30 percent fat so now</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually the percentage but then</p>
<p>the calories are double that</p>
<p>so in other words I wouldn&rsquo;t even worry</p>
<p>about trying to measure anything just</p>
<p>follow my videos and then we show you</p>
<p>what to eat and you&rsquo;re good make dinner</p>
<p>Roger</p>
<p>okay all right Sandra you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see Florida what&rsquo;s your question</p>
<p>hi hi I had a question regarding I said</p>
<p>right now okay I&rsquo;m for like five years</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for dr. just so my problem</p>
<p>obviously blurring and indigestion and</p>
<p>everything and then I&rsquo;m glad a friend</p>
<p>returned your videos and then I find out</p>
<p>you know everything you talk in the</p>
<p>videos it was Mike&rsquo;s income and then we</p>
<p>centrally I did HIV a scan</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got gall bladder injection</p>
<p>fraction and then the result was the</p>
<p>midship dimension it gall bladder</p>
<p>injection we see gall bladder dyskinesia</p>
<p>singly my question is it is possible</p>
<p>doing here o fix it because the doctor</p>
<p>said I had to take it out and then I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what to do it now yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of confusions on the gall</p>
<p>bladder I&rsquo;m going to do a video on I</p>
<p>mean not a video I&rsquo;m going to do</p>
<p>actually write a book on the gall</p>
<p>bladder simply because there&rsquo;s some real</p>
<p>important things you need to know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re describing is a</p>
<p>problem with a dysfunctional gall</p>
<p>bladder which relates to part of the</p>
<p>autonomic nervous system okay and if you</p>
<p>try to look up that data you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to find anything like your there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no data like there&rsquo;s so many unknowns</p>
<p>about that even with the diagnosis that</p>
<p>you found so I&rsquo;m not telling you not to</p>
<p>take the gall bladder all I&rsquo;m telling</p>
<p>you is that if you get on strict keto</p>
<p>and you do in a minute fasting you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna instantly see improvements in the</p>
<p>gall bladder your relief in bloating and</p>
<p>then over time you&rsquo;re going to see more</p>
<p>and more</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m saying you should try</p>
<p>it out the other thing to take in</p>
<p>consideration is that the autonomic</p>
<p>nervous system affects a lot of</p>
<p>different valves in the body as it</p>
<p>constricts and days and dilates and one</p>
<p>of the best remedies for that is vitamin</p>
<p>b1 so if you&rsquo;re taking the nutritional</p>
<p>yeast like you should you may find also</p>
<p>additional improvement in that area of</p>
<p>your body stress and high drean or</p>
<p>cortisol stress will also shut down the</p>
<p>gallbladder high levels of estrogen will</p>
<p>interfere with the gallbladder in the</p>
<p>bile production but if you just change</p>
<p>the diet just see what happens there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another condition that gastroparesis</p>
<p>which is a real sluggishness of</p>
<p>digestion which is part of the autonomic</p>
<p>nervous system that don&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>what causes it well that&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>sluggish digestive system if you put</p>
<p>back in these basics nine times out of</p>
<p>ten you&rsquo;ll see improvements I&rsquo;ve seen it</p>
<p>over and over and over again that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I would do if I were you</p>
<p>thanks Sandra all right Steve do we have</p>
<p>another question on social media we sure</p>
<p>do and we are gonna be extraordinarily</p>
<p>fair today by going back and forth</p>
<p>between Facebook so Patti&rsquo;s up next she</p>
<p>has no gallbladder Terry was there any</p>
<p>other news maybe she just wants to know</p>
<p>what they have to do</p>
<p>well they do we do have some that you</p>
<p>can buy we actually sell them on the</p>
<p>website they come in different models</p>
<p>the plastic titanium steel you get that</p>
<p>replaced you&rsquo;re good to go she said she</p>
<p>was medium/large so okay yeah just a</p>
<p>medium or large would be fine I would</p>
<p>get one with you know durable because</p>
<p>they you don&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t want to have</p>
<p>those give out but if you actually have</p>
<p>the gallbladder removed what that means</p>
<p>is now you have a direct tube from your</p>
<p>liver where it drains into the small</p>
<p>intestine so there&rsquo;s no longer a storage</p>
<p>facility which means the concentration</p>
<p>that bile is not going to be as</p>
<p>concentrated as it was which means that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be have a deficiency to</p>
<p>some degree which means that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to not be able to have the full</p>
<p>capacity to extract the full benefits</p>
<p>vitamin-a d e k omega-3 fatty acids eh a</p>
<p>and a lot of the other fats that you</p>
<p>need so at some point i would basically</p>
<p>start taking purified bile salts over</p>
<p>time you&rsquo;re going to need that</p>
<p>especially if you notice like the stool</p>
<p>starts floating your vision starts going</p>
<p>bad at night because you&rsquo;re starting to</p>
<p>show deficiency but that it might not</p>
<p>show up right away so i would take like</p>
<p>one purify bile salt tablet right after</p>
<p>you eat just to maintain that that bile</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s also a lubricant for the</p>
<p>colon so if you don&rsquo;t have enough file</p>
<p>then you make it constipation just some</p>
<p>advice well that&rsquo;s interesting and you</p>
<p>know i think that&rsquo;s encouraging because</p>
<p>i bet a lot of listeners share my</p>
<p>ignorance I thought when you got your</p>
<p>gallbladder out that you no longer had</p>
<p>any bile but it&rsquo;s just a storage spot is</p>
<p>that right so it&rsquo;s all just a sack no</p>
<p>idea it&rsquo;s a little sack that just stores</p>
<p>and concentrates bile to twenty times so</p>
<p>you and that&rsquo;s for a reason and what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting is some people do even grow</p>
<p>the gall bladder back or at least</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re remnants of the gall bladder so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another possibility too yeah all</p>
<p>right so let&rsquo;s go to Erin from Virginia</p>
<p>Fairfax right down the street</p>
<p>Erin are you there yes dr. Burke thank</p>
<p>you so much for your work</p>
<p>I actually was in Alexandria before ten</p>
<p>minutes from your location I have moved</p>
<p>to Fairfax then I came to know you okay</p>
<p>I have a couple questions yeah um I&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>ketosis and while eating more protein</p>
<p>I get Kaylee an itchy scalp how to get</p>
<p>rid of it and probably it&rsquo;s a related</p>
<p>question the next one how to get rid of</p>
<p>fungus or the bad bacteria from body and</p>
<p>only have good bacteria</p>
<p>okay so there&rsquo;s this constant battle in</p>
<p>your immune system between the good and</p>
<p>bad fungus and bacteria and yeast and</p>
<p>Candida and this whole thing the best</p>
<p>way to do it there&rsquo;s a couple ways you</p>
<p>want to make sure that your stomach is</p>
<p>very very acidic so I would start taking</p>
<p>the taint how to chloride or</p>
<p>outside of vinegar well both of them</p>
<p>probably and other certifiers too you</p>
<p>can do kombucha tea but we need to start</p>
<p>acidifying the stomach what will that do</p>
<p>that will allow or prevent the pathogens</p>
<p>from entering from the food into the</p>
<p>rest of the digestive tract so you</p>
<p>probably want to take that before the</p>
<p>meal and the other precursor for</p>
<p>hydrochloric acid would be just sea salt</p>
<p>so don&rsquo;t omit salt the other thing to do</p>
<p>is to take a very good probiotic one</p>
<p>that I would recommend liquid and it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get destroyed of the stomach</p>
<p>level because that probiotic will start</p>
<p>flourishing and prospering and not allow</p>
<p>the pathogens to have any space to live</p>
<p>anymore so it outcompetes the bad</p>
<p>bacteria a couple of things to take on a</p>
<p>regular basis would be regular oregano</p>
<p>thyme garlic these are herbs that you</p>
<p>can take to make the unfriendly bacteria</p>
<p>go bye-bye and the fact that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>bringing your carbs down way down low</p>
<p>will starve off definitely the fungus is</p>
<p>and the candida that live with sugar so</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re putting sugar in there</p>
<p>they will keep keep growing as far as</p>
<p>the protein goes that&rsquo;s just a good</p>
<p>indication that you you need to lower</p>
<p>them out a protein that you eat increase</p>
<p>more vegetables I think your you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>start changing things around right off</p>
<p>the bat thanks Erin okay so how about</p>
<p>YouTube yeah</p>
<p>Android and that&rsquo;s not a misspelling</p>
<p>that might be a nan de plume or</p>
<p>something but anyway Android as having</p>
<p>negative effects from daily coffee</p>
<p>consumption something that I can often</p>
<p>relate to</p>
<p>Wow that&rsquo;s interesting because coffee is</p>
<p>supposed to be good for you now I I / I</p>
<p>abuse coffee in college and I drink pots</p>
<p>of a Cuban coffee</p>
<p>and at first I can get away with it and</p>
<p>then all of a sudden you know the amount</p>
<p>of coffee that I have now is literally</p>
<p>the smallest little cup and I do great</p>
<p>on that if I do more not good so I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the over consumption of coffee I</p>
<p>always make sure it&rsquo;s organic coffee by</p>
<p>putting cream in it it&rsquo;s organic cream I</p>
<p>do not do anything else but that</p>
<p>but coffee has caffeine and has other</p>
<p>things in it</p>
<p>it also has tannins that can irritate</p>
<p>certain people so you can try tea herb</p>
<p>tea green tea is probably a lot better</p>
<p>but I would definitely cut down the</p>
<p>amount just one a day yeah that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m out key and general black tea that</p>
<p>you you know get R is that do you love</p>
<p>it and coffee yes it has less caffeine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s better for you and it is still a</p>
<p>stimulant so you can&rsquo;t just keep</p>
<p>drinking it you know cuz you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to keep you up at night Steve</p>
<p>you know any any friends you know that</p>
<p>have lower urinary tract type symptoms</p>
<p>like with urination prostates frequency</p>
<p>at night incomplete voiding well I&rsquo;m 66</p>
<p>so without giving you TMI yes I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>that camp and you know it is an issue</p>
<p>especially with clearing you know I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>up seven times a night that</p>
<p>do you know that 50% of all men that</p>
<p>reach 60 have those symptoms and 90% of</p>
<p>all men who are hit 90 basically wait</p>
<p>how did it go if you&rsquo;re 90 years old</p>
<p>like 90% of men will have that symptom</p>
<p>so and that is interesting I&rsquo;m gonna do</p>
<p>a video on that but I&rsquo;m telling you that</p>
<p>is a problem with too much insulin and</p>
<p>insulin resistance so I want you to do a</p>
<p>scientific experiment Steve okay we</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t get in the details but here&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I want you to do between now and next</p>
<p>week okay you ready for this first of</p>
<p>all you know monitor your urine how many</p>
<p>times you get up at night and bring your</p>
<p>carbohydrates down below 10 grams per</p>
<p>day it&rsquo;s like almost like nothing no</p>
<p>carbs right all right and then notice</p>
<p>how many times you get up at night</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna find that it&rsquo;s less and</p>
<p>less and less if any it completely just</p>
<p>handles that getting up at night thing</p>
<p>and for those of you that are listening</p>
<p>that are new to my channel just start</p>
<p>watching on my dr. burgher calm on the</p>
<p>blog channel it&rsquo;s the first video how to</p>
<p>do keto how to do min fasting step one</p>
<p>two three watch those videos apply it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you for men&rsquo;s bladder issue</p>
<p>and urination issue it&rsquo;s such a simple</p>
<p>simple thing to fix if you know how I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t hear you</p>
<p>sorry I&rsquo;m going to start the experiment</p>
<p>right away and get into my lab coat and</p>
<p>begin the petri dish study you mean</p>
<p>after your last supper tonight now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna start like right now all right</p>
<p>okay good all right so we&rsquo;re gonna go to</p>
<p>Surrey from Toronto Kelly not California</p>
<p>Canada</p>
<p>are you there yeah what&rsquo;s your question</p>
<p>I want to know like I&rsquo;m teaching they</p>
<p>have formula capsules from your one yes</p>
<p>sir I do one meal a day sometime so if I</p>
<p>take that during the fasting time will</p>
<p>that be interrupting my fasting period</p>
<p>does it have Carol</p>
<p>wait good question absolutely not those</p>
<p>supplements you&rsquo;re taking they have less</p>
<p>than one calorie so there is not going</p>
<p>to be any problem with interfering in</p>
<p>fact I recommend take your supplements</p>
<p>on an empty stomach</p>
<p>most of them and you&rsquo;ll find that and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s relate it to digestion they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>probably work a little bit better so</p>
<p>yeah no problem you can take them</p>
<p>whenever you want so I can I have to</p>
<p>take it two times a day like a morning</p>
<p>and an evening would be fine</p>
<p>that would be fine yes fine that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>doctor I have been watching your videos</p>
<p>and you are just awesome I I was trying</p>
<p>to convey this in many ways like email</p>
<p>but I could not reach you in any way so</p>
<p>finally I somehow it is the first time</p>
<p>that I have ever gone and alive or I</p>
<p>have tried doing this in my entire life</p>
<p>why would you ask such a great person</p>
<p>and then I made all the effort that I</p>
<p>could do reach and talk to you you are</p>
<p>just awesome your videos are like a</p>
<p>biology like I always have been</p>
<p>interesting learning a lot of things and</p>
<p>then learning science and stuff but your</p>
<p>clouds your videos are like really</p>
<p>awesome I wish you all the factors that</p>
<p>may you live longer like doing all the</p>
<p>good things to everybody you are such an</p>
<p>awesome for something it&rsquo;s so much I</p>
<p>appreciate all what you&rsquo;re doing you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be healthy so that you can help a lot of</p>
<p>other people so I got to give you a</p>
<p>longer healthier life so that you can</p>
<p>help so many other people out there you</p>
<p>deserve that doctor thank you so much</p>
<p>thank you well I care what first</p>
<p>first-time caller Siri has done</p>
<p>tremendously well you know the thing</p>
<p>about you know she just she started keto</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s getting results the benefits what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing now Steve is we&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>putting together these really many</p>
<p>little courses putting a lot of them</p>
<p>together and we&rsquo;re gonna have him on the</p>
<p>site very soon so we can kind of</p>
<p>organize the information in a way that</p>
<p>you can find it easier and retain it</p>
<p>better so right now my main focus is on</p>
<p>little courses that you can do digital</p>
<p>courses so stay tuned and if anyone is</p>
<p>you know interest in a specific topic</p>
<p>let me know because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>always open to creating different</p>
<p>courses and in areas that you know you</p>
<p>might be too interested in so thank you</p>
<p>so much all right Steve you have a</p>
<p>question I certainly do</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say wait I&rsquo;m gonna go to the main</p>
<p>sheet here and that&rsquo;s Brian and he wants</p>
<p>to know what a good substitute for</p>
<p>yoghurt might be well do you know they</p>
<p>have the the yogurts that are made out</p>
<p>of almonds and things like that cashews</p>
<p>but you still have to they add a bunch</p>
<p>of stuff in there like a lot of the gums</p>
<p>to make them thicker you could try a</p>
<p>kefir that is plain maybe from a</p>
<p>goalkeeper you can try some of that that</p>
<p>would be alternative to yogurt yogurt</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really give you as many benefits</p>
<p>I mean that you might think it&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of its digested at the stomach level</p>
<p>kefir is much much better and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I would go for if I were you if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking for the the microbes the</p>
<p>friendly bacteria alright let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>Susan from st. Paul Minneapolis are you</p>
<p>there</p>
<p>or Minnesota hi dr. Berg hi I&rsquo;m calling</p>
<p>feeling just a little panicky I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>doing keto and intermittent fasting</p>
<p>since last August and I have yet to be</p>
<p>in ketosis recently I was at my doctor&rsquo;s</p>
<p>office my mom and I know about</p>
<p>cholesterol I know about the different</p>
<p>kinds and the measurements but mine has</p>
<p>gone from in December from 385 to 471 so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m really scared about and</p>
<p>December my triglycerides were actually</p>
<p>good at 122 they have doubled and my</p>
<p>good cholesterol has gone down and</p>
<p>recently I have had been when I first</p>
<p>started keto I was off of my blood sugar</p>
<p>I took myself off my blood sugar</p>
<p>medication my diabetes medication and</p>
<p>was doing very very well but mine now my</p>
<p>blood sugars have gone up and I have</p>
<p>gamed waved back okay I just don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what to do from here okay so I have a</p>
<p>question from you yeah yesterday how</p>
<p>many meals did you eat yesterday I ate</p>
<p>one meal and what did you eat that meal</p>
<p>I had salad and I had some spaghetti</p>
<p>squash and that was all that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>is there anything that you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>that borders on like not that great I</p>
<p>think yes I haven&rsquo;t introduced one thing</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know that I can mention the</p>
<p>product name but it is a weight-loss</p>
<p>product that is very low in carbs but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s high in fact okay what is your</p>
<p>blood Sugar&rsquo;s running your you check</p>
<p>your blood Sugar&rsquo;s yes morning of course</p>
<p>I understand about dawn phenomenom they</p>
<p>are now regularly over 200 and any time</p>
<p>after I eat they&rsquo;re well over 200 ok and</p>
<p>then do you when you have that one meal</p>
<p>a day are you hungry or not um actually</p>
<p>I have not been no but once I start</p>
<p>eating them I feel hungry</p>
<p>right ok so this is this would be my</p>
<p>advice for you ok you&rsquo;re ready that are</p>
<p>you ready for this I am ok there&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>things I there&rsquo;s one principle that I</p>
<p>always always always recommend and that</p>
<p>is don&rsquo;t eat unless you&rsquo;re hungry ok so</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening is you&rsquo;re not hungry</p>
<p>guess what your body is trying to burn</p>
<p>your fat and then you eat and it stops</p>
<p>burning fat because it&rsquo;ll increase</p>
<p>insulin you obviously your system is</p>
<p>very very sensitive right now and you</p>
<p>probably still in the woods not out of</p>
<p>the woods with related to insulin</p>
<p>resistance so you I would bet anything</p>
<p>if you went to the doctor and get a</p>
<p>fasting insulin test it would be high</p>
<p>and with severe insulin resistance so</p>
<p>but probably because the pancreas is</p>
<p>getting tired too the blood sugar is</p>
<p>going up up up so two things one is I</p>
<p>would fast longer so you&rsquo;re eating once</p>
<p>every other day and then keep checking</p>
<p>your Sugar&rsquo;s and see what happens from</p>
<p>that but make sure you take the neutral</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re fasting B vitamins vitamin</p>
<p>D trace minerals and also beaver just</p>
<p>two regular minerals - because we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if you&rsquo;re deficient so that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I would do number one and number two I</p>
<p>would get coaching from someone like the</p>
<p>group that they have let&rsquo;s see some of</p>
<p>the key dough doctors out there and I</p>
<p>have a I might have some of my website</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some like this cardiologist</p>
<p>that will coach people I would hire some</p>
<p>one of those guys and maybe dr. Fung has</p>
<p>a group that you can be connected and</p>
<p>have that backup doctor to you know</p>
<p>regulate things and you know help you</p>
<p>with your medication and then also</p>
<p>attend our summit because I have two</p>
<p>cardiologists are going to talk about</p>
<p>this that&rsquo;s what I would do right now</p>
<p>because I think the blood sugars are the</p>
<p>main issue to try to resolve that but I</p>
<p>think the long-term longer-term fasting</p>
<p>is going to help you but you need more</p>
<p>of a a coach on this to handle some of</p>
<p>the medical questions but I think it&rsquo;s I</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s a way to do this so you</p>
<p>can actually control things but you just</p>
<p>need to tweak it and you need more</p>
<p>supervision thanks Susan for your call</p>
<p>all right Steve ready for your question</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re right absolutely so oops we</p>
<p>better go to face book of Marguerite is</p>
<p>Quito good for an underactive thyroid</p>
<p>underactive yes yeah it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>that people are so concerned about the</p>
<p>thyroid with keto and intermittent</p>
<p>fasting that the main thing is that your</p>
<p>your thyroid won&rsquo;t have to work as hard</p>
<p>when you start doing the keto and I mean</p>
<p>fast and because you&rsquo;re using a fuel</p>
<p>source that&rsquo;s more efficient and your</p>
<p>your requirements for calories go down</p>
<p>because your metabolism is is just it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not excessively burning glucose anymore</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re burning fat which has more energy</p>
<p>per volume so your your system is gonna</p>
<p>be more efficient so the the thyroid</p>
<p>need to work is going to come down and</p>
<p>if you the key thing is making sure you</p>
<p>have the right nutrients when you eat so</p>
<p>make sure it&rsquo;s the healthy version of</p>
<p>keto with all the nutrients and I think</p>
<p>that should benefit a thyroid what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>usually behind most thyroid conditions</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Hashimoto&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s autoimmune and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not even a thyroid problem per se</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an immune problem and the fasting</p>
<p>is like that one of the best things you</p>
<p>can do for that with some additional</p>
<p>things zinc selenium and vitamin D and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m saying about that Steve</p>
<p>okay well we&rsquo;ll keep rolling let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>Mohammed on YouTube and he wants to know</p>
<p>the best treatment for a SIBO whatever</p>
<p>that is SIBO is small intestinal</p>
<p>bacterial overgrowth and that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>situation where the microbes the</p>
<p>friendly microbes that should be in the</p>
<p>large intestine now have moved up to the</p>
<p>small intestine and they shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>there because if they&rsquo;re there then when</p>
<p>you eat especially like fiber or even</p>
<p>probiotics then what&rsquo;s gonna happen is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re gonna get a lot of</p>
<p>bloating and gas from in the wrong place</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna feel oh my gosh this</p>
<p>feels terrible what happens with those</p>
<p>microbes now is they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>competing for all your food and</p>
<p>nutrients so they kind of create</p>
<p>nutritional deficiencies because most of</p>
<p>the digestion and absorption of</p>
<p>nutrients happens at the small intestine</p>
<p>so not on the large intestine so you</p>
<p>basically have the microbes kind of</p>
<p>robbing this nutrition so you alright to</p>
<p>make a long story short what do you do</p>
<p>about it what you do is you go on</p>
<p>carnivore for about one to two months</p>
<p>you bring cut out the vegetables</p>
<p>increase the acid in the stomach</p>
<p>hydrochloric acid like pertain how the</p>
<p>chloride do a lot of that and then also</p>
<p>take a natural antibiotic like oregano</p>
<p>tablets and that will help to kill off</p>
<p>some of this these microbes but the key</p>
<p>is fasting you need to fast like one one</p>
<p>meal a day that will that will help all</p>
<p>right okay sounds great so let&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>move on to Facebook Deann I have low</p>
<p>tolerance for veggies any suggestions</p>
<p>please yeah there&rsquo;s a lot of things in</p>
<p>vegetables that people may be sensitive</p>
<p>to but not the great majority of the</p>
<p>population just certain people for</p>
<p>example there are lectins in certain</p>
<p>foods I&rsquo;ve done videos on this there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>oxalates and other like spinach and</p>
<p>rhubarb Kiwis which you&rsquo;re not supposed</p>
<p>to be eating and almonds too in</p>
<p>chocolate which is you know not what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably talking about but</p>
<p>vegetables themselves you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>to find something that that agrees with</p>
<p>you especially if there&rsquo;s a digestive</p>
<p>issue now some people do better without</p>
<p>vegetables in which case you need to</p>
<p>maybe do carnivore for a while until you</p>
<p>can do your system in place but the if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re bloating all the time then don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>keep eating them but you could try</p>
<p>fermented you can try a lesser amount</p>
<p>you can try different types like some</p>
<p>people have no problem with like some</p>
<p>romaine lettuce or leafy greens but they</p>
<p>have a huge problem with kale</p>
<p>I personally can do very well on cabbage</p>
<p>cabbage is probably one of the best</p>
<p>things for someone with ulcers or</p>
<p>gastritis but I cannot do broccoli at</p>
<p>all so I avoid it interesting okay so</p>
<p>this is so interesting maybe only</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m interested this is on</p>
<p>YouTube Mimi wants to know how people</p>
<p>who are slim get insulin resistance and</p>
<p>I always thought it was sort of a</p>
<p>blubber issue well if you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>because your metabolism is fast doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mean you can&rsquo;t get insulin resistance I</p>
<p>mean I was I had insulin resistance and</p>
<p>I was like a beanpole and in high school</p>
<p>in college so it&rsquo;s how much sugar you</p>
<p>consume what&rsquo;s gonna happen is you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna you&rsquo;re going to burn off some of</p>
<p>that but it&rsquo;s also you&rsquo;re gonna get</p>
<p>visceral fat that&rsquo;s hidden and tucked</p>
<p>away</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called skinny fat deep into the</p>
<p>liver and around the organs that you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t really see until later in life so</p>
<p>but so many people have</p>
<p>some resistance and are thin and think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fine because they don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>weight problem it&rsquo;s not always the</p>
<p>weight a good test to determine this is</p>
<p>can you go from one meal to the next and</p>
<p>feel comfortable or do you feel oh my</p>
<p>gosh I need a snack right there we know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a problem versus looking down</p>
<p>and having a gut it&rsquo;s not always the</p>
<p>best indicator if it&rsquo;s the it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>hunger and the ability not to be hungry</p>
<p>that is the biggest thing</p>
<p>okay now I&rsquo;m the social media advocate</p>
<p>today so forgive me if I&rsquo;m being a</p>
<p>little pushy but I&rsquo;m just gonna roll</p>
<p>through so we&rsquo;re gonna go back to</p>
<p>Facebook and go to Nene is that right</p>
<p>Nene wants to know the best treatment</p>
<p>for deep vein thrombosis well you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never getting pushy with those questions</p>
<p>today but that&rsquo;s fine deep through a</p>
<p>vein thrombosis</p>
<p>anytime you deal with something like</p>
<p>that the first thing I&rsquo;m gonna ask you</p>
<p>is are you on keto are you doing in a</p>
<p>minute fasting if not get those in don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even worry about the the vascular issues</p>
<p>one of the best things to support the</p>
<p>veins would be foods high in vitamin C</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m talking about leafy greens and</p>
<p>good amounts of them what will block</p>
<p>vitamin C from your tissue Steve is</p>
<p>consuming glucose or sugar if you have</p>
<p>glucose or sugar with vitamin C vitamin</p>
<p>C will not go in your body why because</p>
<p>there are similar chemistry the other</p>
<p>thing is that if you have like deep vein</p>
<p>thrombosis or other issues with</p>
<p>circulation the liver could be involved</p>
<p>especially even when you have a like</p>
<p>this venous issue like a hemorrhoids for</p>
<p>example that&rsquo;s a liver issue so it all</p>
<p>comes back to the liver doesn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>all right you get some more questions</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go tuturro from Calgary Canada</p>
<p>are you there yes I am hi hi my question</p>
<p>is actually I&rsquo;m sitting here with my</p>
<p>wife and she is experiencing extreme</p>
<p>exhaustion and no matter what is that</p>
<p>just terribly she get really really</p>
<p>tired and we watch one of your videos</p>
<p>last night and you talked about what</p>
<p>needs to be done so in the video you</p>
<p>mentioned high dose vitamin</p>
<p>and I just want you to talk about how</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna go taking that and maybe</p>
<p>chicken as well so I have a question is</p>
<p>she on keto and or in a minute fasting</p>
<p>yet we did we started doing it and then</p>
<p>when we want to test the doctor told we</p>
<p>she actually got a really high</p>
<p>cholesterol and then she instead of</p>
<p>taking the cholesterol medications you</p>
<p>stop doing the keto for now okay so let</p>
<p>me just talk about that for a second</p>
<p>because the first thing and I hope you</p>
<p>can see my video but this is I want to</p>
<p>make sure you&rsquo;re doing it the healthy</p>
<p>version of keto because if you do it</p>
<p>includes a lot of high quality foods and</p>
<p>a lot of greens that will counter some</p>
<p>of the cholesterol issues and watch my</p>
<p>video on cholesterol because it could be</p>
<p>that the the fat self what the goal of</p>
<p>one of the cute goals Iquitos to lose</p>
<p>weight right Steve so we want to</p>
<p>actually lose weight and when when you</p>
<p>lose weight your fat cells actually</p>
<p>shrink and what&rsquo;s in the fat cell is</p>
<p>both triglycerides and cholesterol and</p>
<p>guess what&rsquo;s going to have to come out</p>
<p>of the hot cells eventually cholesterol</p>
<p>so your cholesterol might go up so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good thing and so you if you</p>
<p>actually are successful in doing that</p>
<p>and you think there&rsquo;s a problem and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unsuccessful and then you stop because</p>
<p>of that that&rsquo;s a big mistake</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many programs with the</p>
<p>Advocate is sort of lumpy or something</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really hard to take them</p>
<p>seriously but you guys have full heads</p>
<p>of hair your skin looks great you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>healthy weight you&rsquo;re energetic so</p>
<p>clearly if you&rsquo;re following the</p>
<p>recommendations of your program which we</p>
<p>can see that you are this really can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>improve people&rsquo;s lives and looks and</p>
<p>those that don&rsquo;t probably are missing</p>
<p>something because you guys are a hundred</p>
<p>percent the how do you measure up models</p>
<p>of is</p>
<p>Hey would you want to go to a dentist</p>
<p>that has miss has really bad teeth okay</p>
<p>would you want to get marriage</p>
<p>counselling from some of us never been</p>
<p>married no okay so here&rsquo;s the other</p>
<p>question because tyrs had a question</p>
<p>about this fatigue his wife is tired so</p>
<p>yet you want to get back on key don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to lower the carbs okay for sure</p>
<p>because the blood sugar issue will</p>
<p>instantly cause you to be tired but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a couple of the reasons</p>
<p>why you might be tired one would be a</p>
<p>severe vitamin D deficiency so I would</p>
<p>start taking about 20,000 I use about</p>
<p>M&amp;D daily for a while make sure you take</p>
<p>the key to in there and I have videos on</p>
<p>that but that should help you now let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see it doesn&rsquo;t then there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>chronic infection going on probably</p>
<p>epstein-barr virus and that is related</p>
<p>to stress some stressor is in the</p>
<p>background that is keeping the immune</p>
<p>system suppressed that&rsquo;s like so common</p>
<p>so if there is a stressful situation you</p>
<p>need to isolate it nip it in the butt as</p>
<p>fast as possible there&rsquo;s other things</p>
<p>you can do too like you could take them</p>
<p>oregano oil garlic to help this chronic</p>
<p>infection usually it&rsquo;s epstein-barr it</p>
<p>affects the fatigue you&rsquo;re like always</p>
<p>tired but I&rsquo;m telling you the stress</p>
<p>thing is at the top of the list so those</p>
<p>are some things I would do and don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>forget to try also vitamin b1 because b1</p>
<p>will really bring your energy up that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a nutritional yeast all right thanks for</p>
<p>your question</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s see we want to go to</p>
<p>crystal from Pennsylvania are there</p>
<p>crystal yes hi dr. Berg thanks taking my</p>
<p>call sure um so my question is actually</p>
<p>about your supplements you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>wheatgrass juice the electrolytes and</p>
<p>the nutritional you tonight consume all</p>
<p>three of these while I&rsquo;m in my fasting</p>
<p>window okay go ahead no I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>let you answer that and then I&rsquo;ll come</p>
<p>back to my second make you that question</p>
<p>so absolutely yeah</p>
<p>the new supplements that you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>have hardly any calories even the</p>
<p>wheatgrass juice powder has so small</p>
<p>calories because it&rsquo;s so concentrated</p>
<p>like less than one gram per serving so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to affect your fasting in</p>
<p>fact it&rsquo;s going to prevent you having</p>
<p>problems with fasting especially like</p>
<p>symptoms and especially fainting any of</p>
<p>that so it&rsquo;s gonna fortify it because we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know going into that fast if you</p>
<p>have all the nutrients you need because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to eating so you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>lot of times if it&rsquo;s everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>magnified when you do fasting so yeah</p>
<p>you can take them for sure okay great</p>
<p>thank you back on question when is the</p>
<p>best time to take all those three I</p>
<p>guess especially the electrolyte because</p>
<p>I I have been experiencing with in my</p>
<p>instrument and fasting window</p>
<p>tachycardia which is common for me so I</p>
<p>just wanted to know should I be drinking</p>
<p>my electrolytes first thing in the</p>
<p>morning yeah yeah what I do is I mix the</p>
<p>electrolytes with the wheatgrass juice</p>
<p>powder in the morning I take those in</p>
<p>the morning and that way okay they kind</p>
<p>of work there&rsquo;s one more thing about</p>
<p>tachycardia or palpitations or even</p>
<p>arrhythmias that I do want to mention</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re in Quito and I will</p>
<p>be releasing a video on this yes it</p>
<p>could be definitely could be the lack of</p>
<p>electrolytes for sure potassium</p>
<p>magnesium however there&rsquo;s a couple other</p>
<p>things when people deal with keto they</p>
<p>sometimes eat more chocolate even though</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s keto friendly and chocolate has</p>
<p>theobromine in caffeine which tends to</p>
<p>create this arrhythmia issue that people</p>
<p>have it could even increase the pulse</p>
<p>rate also if you&rsquo;re deficient and be one</p>
<p>that can also increase the pulse rate</p>
<p>FYI so you want to take the nutritional</p>
<p>yeast there&rsquo;s also if you&rsquo;re doing a lot</p>
<p>of coffee that can increase the pulse</p>
<p>rate but there&rsquo;s one more thing and that</p>
<p>is related to gall bladder they&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>EKGs CG readings on this whether looking</p>
<p>at the endocardial gram and they found</p>
<p>abnormal patterns with this heart Tracy</p>
<p>that are related to a sluggish gall</p>
<p>bladder gall stones some issue with the</p>
<p>GALT the bile ducts and I already knew</p>
<p>that and being in practice so a lot of</p>
<p>times if you are doing too much fat or</p>
<p>maybe doing like added fat that can put</p>
<p>stress in the gall bladder and create</p>
<p>tachycardia or rhythm problems so just</p>
<p>be aware of that and watch my video on</p>
<p>the gall bladder to do the flushing on</p>
<p>that and don&rsquo;t forget don&rsquo;t forget about</p>
<p>the gall bladder okay all right good</p>
<p>question what this is an interesting and</p>
<p>timely question from Facebook saiad</p>
<p>Syed&rsquo;s gives me should people with kovat</p>
<p>19 stop hito an if&rsquo; and of course i can</p>
<p>jump in there real quickly I could not</p>
<p>eat a thing so in terms of intermittent</p>
<p>fasting you know I could have done a</p>
<p>two-week fast because I just second I</p>
<p>put something in my mouth I just didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want another bike so and then of course</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any reason why I should have</p>
<p>stuffed down donuts during Kobe which I</p>
<p>did not do well when you when you get</p>
<p>the covet then you need to go back to</p>
<p>carbs right listen what what is the</p>
<p>print what is the biggest risk factor</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s people with metabolic problems what</p>
<p>is that that is a problem with insulin</p>
<p>resistance that&rsquo;s a problem with sugar</p>
<p>like if you want to worsen the kovat</p>
<p>experience start doing carbs I just did</p>
<p>a video on the relationship between high</p>
<p>blood sugar and your immune system when</p>
<p>you watch that video you&rsquo;re gonna find</p>
<p>that high blood sugar literally</p>
<p>paralyzes and shuts down your immune</p>
<p>system take a look at a diabetic they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting infections all over the place</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re susceptible to viruses and</p>
<p>bacterial infections why because of the</p>
<p>high sugar so I will be doing more</p>
<p>videos on that but no you want to stay</p>
<p>on keto now intimate fasting the reason</p>
<p>why your appetite goes away is your body</p>
<p>is naturally trying to fight it off and</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s very very important that you if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not hungry don&rsquo;t eat especially</p>
<p>if you have a virus infection you know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s interesting about that I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>looking at some other additional</p>
<p>research on</p>
<p>starvation and even people that have</p>
<p>anorexia not that you should do that at</p>
<p>all but the point is that when someone</p>
<p>is enter X anorexic their immune system</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t seem to have immune problems</p>
<p>at first anyway until later which is</p>
<p>interesting you would think if you start</p>
<p>to like not eat that your immune system</p>
<p>would you start having getting sick</p>
<p>apparently what happens when you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>eat there&rsquo;s so many different survival</p>
<p>mechanisms in place it activates this</p>
<p>survival gene that then turns off like</p>
<p>it like makes your immune system not not</p>
<p>necessarily be weak again I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>recommending that okay let&rsquo;s go to Noel</p>
<p>from Virginia are you there yes I have a</p>
<p>always had a strange reaction to</p>
<p>fermented liquids specifically apple</p>
<p>cider vinegar your probiotic kombucha</p>
<p>alcohol and I just get like on like an</p>
<p>instant headache or neck ache sometimes</p>
<p>it can go down my whole body have you</p>
<p>ever heard of that</p>
<p>yes that sounds like you have a</p>
<p>histamine intolerance do you ever hear</p>
<p>that yeah yeah I will release a video on</p>
<p>that it means that there&rsquo;s an enzyme</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re missing in your liver and so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not able to break down these</p>
<p>histamines which are basically higher in</p>
<p>fermented foods okay and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of going to create the headache so</p>
<p>there is something you can do about it</p>
<p>you can wait till I release the video or</p>
<p>you can just basically there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>things you can do that enzyme is present</p>
<p>in a couple supplements out there one</p>
<p>would be a it&rsquo;s a kidney extract an</p>
<p>actual kidney bovine kidney and you</p>
<p>would take that grass-fed of course you</p>
<p>can eat kidney and it has an enzyme to</p>
<p>help lower the histamines there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>several other things I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>recommend but probiotics are very very</p>
<p>important</p>
<p>avoiding that right now is what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to do to prevent the high</p>
<p>histamine this is just something that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you know it&rsquo;s a liver thing and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just hitting it&rsquo;s called histamine</p>
<p>and tolerance okay so for now just avoid</p>
<p>those and then that do the grass-fed</p>
<p>kidney bovine it yeah yeah there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>mend a couple things so in fact I will</p>
<p>release that video probably tomorrow or</p>
<p>Monday sustained stay tuned and then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll see exactly what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on okay alright thank you so much you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>welcome okay doc so Katherine has been</p>
<p>waiting very patiently in YouTube land</p>
<p>and she wants to know what normal blood</p>
<p>sugar levels are please well normal</p>
<p>blood sugar levels if you&rsquo;re not on keto</p>
<p>should be like eighty eighty would be</p>
<p>perfect okay but once you get in Quito</p>
<p>in a minute fasting they come down</p>
<p>fasting blood sugars come down to like</p>
<p>seventy even sixty and that&rsquo;s the new</p>
<p>normal</p>
<p>why because you&rsquo;re not eating sugar so</p>
<p>your body is adjusting it&rsquo;s not a bad</p>
<p>thing now some people say oh you have</p>
<p>hypoglycemia yeah but you feel fine and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re running on ketones</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s between like sixty and eighty</p>
<p>now as it starts to go up I&rsquo;ve done some</p>
<p>earlier videos that your blood sugar</p>
<p>should be a little higher like ninety or</p>
<p>hundred but I changed my viewpoint that</p>
<p>when you start keto and fasting it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to come down but pre-diabetes gets</p>
<p>like from 100 to like 125 and then over</p>
<p>126 or more then you get into the</p>
<p>diabetes now what&rsquo;s happening now Steve</p>
<p>well before you get pre-diabetes and</p>
<p>diabetes what happening what happened</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening is you have this high</p>
<p>level of sugar in the diet but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>being buffered by this filter it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called insulin but glucose is toxic of</p>
<p>course but so is insulin too much of it</p>
<p>so your body starts developing</p>
<p>resistance to the insulin so now your</p>
<p>body has to make more to penetrate this</p>
<p>barrier to regulate the blood sugars so</p>
<p>if per</p>
<p>10 to 15 years your blood sugars are</p>
<p>normal and you got this filter going on</p>
<p>insulin resistance with all these other</p>
<p>issues you&rsquo;re getting all the symptoms</p>
<p>until eventually your pancreas goes down</p>
<p>oh my gosh I&rsquo;m just so tired and then it</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t pump out the insulin anymore and</p>
<p>then the blood sugars go up there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>more control</p>
<p>no more filter so that&rsquo;s really what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening so just because you have</p>
<p>normal blood sugars does not mean</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s cool the main thing is get</p>
<p>on keto intermittent fasting right off</p>
<p>the bat and that way you can prevent</p>
<p>this whole pre and pre-diabetes</p>
<p>situation all right so I&rsquo;m gonna go to</p>
<p>Hamidah</p>
<p>and yeah okay hi how are you hi dr.</p>
<p>Burke sorry thank you for taking my call</p>
<p>sure I have a baby 11 months and I</p>
<p>wanted to know if I can give him</p>
<p>nutritional yeast and fermented food</p>
<p>like kefir</p>
<p>also how to deal with his adenoids and</p>
<p>heart murmur because he sweats a lot</p>
<p>when I feed him and when he plays the</p>
<p>Lord okay you know I did a video on that</p>
<p>if you have excessive sweating that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>usually he needs more sea salt that</p>
<p>should actually calm that down or</p>
<p>actually handle that as well as</p>
<p>b-vitamins which is nutritionally so yes</p>
<p>you can give him nutritional yeast for</p>
<p>sure are you breastfeeding formula but I</p>
<p>just give him to two bottles a day only</p>
<p>only okay yeah that&rsquo;d be good yeah the</p>
<p>problem with the formulas are it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>so high in carbs it&rsquo;s so bad honestly</p>
<p>this is just between you and me and the</p>
<p>four walls don&rsquo;t mention anyone I told</p>
<p>you this but if I were you I would find</p>
<p>out the local LH a leak and get some</p>
<p>actual real breast milk I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>tell you why breast milk for infants and</p>
<p>up to six months minimum</p>
<p>but even two years with the ideal is one</p>
<p>of the top things you can do for that</p>
<p>future of your child&rsquo;s health because of</p>
<p>the amount of immune factors and the</p>
<p>body&rsquo;s going through support friendly</p>
<p>bacteria that just prevents so many</p>
<p>other issues unfortunately the the</p>
<p>formulas are just pure garbage so some</p>
<p>of the best foods that you can give your</p>
<p>child right now of course if you can get</p>
<p>some of that breast milk I I would not</p>
<p>personally do anything synthetic like</p>
<p>formulas that have chemicals in them or</p>
<p>a lot of glucose</p>
<p>I would instead do eggs with egg yolk</p>
<p>especially I would do maybe some stews</p>
<p>with some there&rsquo;s a really good summer</p>
<p>sausage that has no glucose or dextrose</p>
<p>that we give glue see so it has like</p>
<p>different combinations it&rsquo;s higher in</p>
<p>fat do really really good on that</p>
<p>occasionally we do berries for Lucy but</p>
<p>she does cheese grass-fed cheese she</p>
<p>does some pate sometimes like liver</p>
<p>would try to do that some meats and</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s just thriving of course she is</p>
<p>doing a still some breast milk but not a</p>
<p>lot but she&rsquo;s weaning off but she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still doing that it&rsquo;s incredibly strong</p>
<p>immune system so nutritional yeast is</p>
<p>very very important and seeking go to</p>
<p>call that to a little HEA League down</p>
<p>the street alright so anyway I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>heartbroken social media has trusted me</p>
<p>today and I tried to get as many of</p>
<p>their questions as I could but I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>fallen short there&rsquo;s still some left but</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got good news I&rsquo;m gonna pop up</p>
<p>right now</p>
<p>the doctor Berg comm site where they can</p>
<p>find</p>
<p>answers to many of the questions as you</p>
<p>said routinely correct doctor yeah so</p>
<p>all these questions guys are actually in</p>
<p>my YouTube videos the problem is finding</p>
<p>them if you&rsquo;re gonna find them a much</p>
<p>better if you go to dr. Byrd calm the</p>
<p>blog and do in the search bar because</p>
<p>you know in YouTube unfortunately and</p>
<p>like this started last October it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>harder to find my videos even if you</p>
<p>search by my name they put a bunch of</p>
<p>other doctors out there so I&rsquo;m a little</p>
<p>bit like curious what&rsquo;s going on with</p>
<p>YouTube it&rsquo;s just finding the right</p>
<p>information even when you type my name I</p>
<p>need to go to Mohamed he&rsquo;s been waiting</p>
<p>patiently Pennsylvania are you there yes</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here doctor thanks for taking the</p>
<p>call sure my quick question is that I</p>
<p>heard a lot of videos and you told us</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a deficiencies of different</p>
<p>vitamins you know and but because most</p>
<p>of them have a 7 a deficiency you told</p>
<p>us you know how many minimum</p>
<p>deficiencies can indicate you are</p>
<p>deficient for that vitamin and also my</p>
<p>question is that if we have only one or</p>
<p>two symptoms it&rsquo;s mean that we are start</p>
<p>deficient for that special supplement</p>
<p>you know how do you how do we know that</p>
<p>we are deficient or this one if you have</p>
<p>one or two symptoms there&rsquo;s somebody</p>
<p>maximum it&rsquo;s a very very very difficult</p>
<p>question because you have two types of</p>
<p>deficiency you have what&rsquo;s called a</p>
<p>franc deficiency or your classical which</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like severely you know deficient</p>
<p>in certain things like scurvy for</p>
<p>example Pro leg rub berry berry these</p>
<p>are all major deficiencies vitamin d and</p>
<p>vitamin b2 and b1 those you just have to</p>
<p>understand the symptoms okay but the</p>
<p>ones that are way more common are the</p>
<p>subclinical deficiencies and you mean</p>
<p>unless you understand the symptoms you</p>
<p>may not know that you even have it so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really a matter of understanding</p>
<p>the symptoms and then trying it out</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re fatigued for example</p>
<p>that could come from like 20 or 30 or 40</p>
<p>different things because that could be</p>
<p>come and invited my C deficiency about a</p>
<p>B deficiency so you want to be able to</p>
<p>kind of</p>
<p>get clues and try things out but you</p>
<p>know instead of doing that you just get</p>
<p>your diet right and and then you go from</p>
<p>there because that should solve things</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the problem the RDAs are only</p>
<p>meant to prevent a deficiency not</p>
<p>maintain a healthy body so here you are</p>
<p>trying oh I got my this much nutrition</p>
<p>for this vitamin these RDAs but guess</p>
<p>what if you have other problems blood</p>
<p>sugar issues stress inflammation lack of</p>
<p>sleep the requirement for that nutrient</p>
<p>is much higher so when I do videos when</p>
<p>I talk about nutritional efficiencies or</p>
<p>I keep hammering over and over vitamin D</p>
<p>potassium b1 the reason I&rsquo;m doing that</p>
<p>is because these are the ones that</p>
<p>people need the most and they&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>most efficient and you need to emphasize</p>
<p>those versus other ones you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to worry about too much like iron</p>
<p>deficiency with men because they hope</p>
<p>they retain that sodium deficiency</p>
<p>usually you don&rsquo;t worry about that so</p>
<p>these are just points to think with I</p>
<p>will be doing more videos on vitamins</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s an interesting topic but</p>
<p>thanks for your call guys before we go I</p>
<p>want to say that we&rsquo;re doing this</p>
<p>amazing summit digitally it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be remote virtual at the end of November</p>
<p>definitely sign up the speakers now are</p>
<p>are getting ready for this event it&rsquo;s</p>
