<p>Ôªø[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>welcome back everyone we&rsquo;re here with</p>
<p>another q a anything that I say is</p>
<p>definitely not going to diagnose or</p>
<p>replace your medical care check with</p>
<p>your doctor before implementing any of</p>
<p>these</p>
<p>ideas that we talk about</p>
<p>we have a great room today of uh in the</p>
<p>green room we have great guests that are</p>
<p>on that we&rsquo;re going to answer the</p>
<p>questions as well as on social media so</p>
<p>Steve Dive Right In let&rsquo;s get started</p>
<p>well I I sure will now slightly</p>
<p>prejudiced because our first guest is</p>
<p>from Winston-Salem North Carolina</p>
<p>arguably the racing capital of America</p>
<p>anyway and I&rsquo;m going to unmute her and</p>
<p>this is Mary from North Carolina Mary</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re wrong with Dr Byrd</p>
<p>good morning I&rsquo;m 65. I have no</p>
<p>gallbladder for 28 years uh they told me</p>
<p>I have a fatty liver a long time ago</p>
<p>um I have abdominal fat</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a pre-diabetic</p>
<p>um and my biggest problem is I have</p>
<p>blood sugar drops two or three times at</p>
<p>night that wake me up I have a</p>
<p>continuous glucose monitor with an alarm</p>
<p>so I feel better about that and um I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>like to sleep through the night</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good goal have you started keto</p>
<p>yet or intermittent fasting</p>
<p>I have increased my fasting time to 10</p>
<p>hours and then I found that just the</p>
<p>last two nights I had all the symptoms</p>
<p>but not the blood sugar drop and that</p>
<p>was confusing to me</p>
<p>wow so so something is changing have you</p>
<p>started to reduce your carbs yet</p>
<p>oh sometimes I try to eat something low</p>
<p>carb like a healthy salad with grilled</p>
<p>chicken on top and then I have like</p>
<p>severe carb Cravings after that so I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>tried but not real successfully</p>
<p>probably what you&rsquo;re running into is</p>
<p>without that gallbladder we just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have enough bile to extract some of the</p>
<p>fat soluble nutrients and things that</p>
<p>could satisfy your brain so you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>okay good I can do this I think um</p>
<p>one thing that I would do if I were you</p>
<p>is I would um</p>
<p>add the apple cider vinegar like a</p>
<p>tablespoon of water which will automatic</p>
<p>before in the evening</p>
<p>um somewhat before bed because that will</p>
<p>actually right there help give you</p>
<p>energy directly you can use it as fuel</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t spike your blood sugars it can</p>
<p>help stabilize things when you wake up</p>
<p>in the morning also through the night</p>
<p>the other thing is berberine is a</p>
<p>natural kind of a natural metformin that</p>
<p>can help with insulin resistance which</p>
<p>you probably have some pretty severe</p>
<p>insulin resistance but if the goal is to</p>
<p>handle these issues that you mentioned</p>
<p>um we want a combination of</p>
<p>both intermittent fasting and keto the</p>
<p>problem that you&rsquo;re running into is you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you probably can&rsquo;t go for a long</p>
<p>without being hungry or craving so the</p>
<p>way to go longer is to lower your carbs</p>
<p>so maybe you start off with some</p>
<p>replacements for the carbs like some</p>
<p>healthy versions of the you know</p>
<p>pleasure Foods or sugary foods that you</p>
<p>eat and then you start to lower the carb</p>
<p>which then will allow you to uh</p>
<p>start to shift the body more to fat</p>
<p>burning while you add more fat to your</p>
<p>meals to make you more satisfied to go a</p>
<p>little bit longer with fasting so now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re at 10 hours and you&rsquo;re at 12 15</p>
<p>18 and then 20. and I think you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>right in the the transitional phase</p>
<p>where if you just push through that and</p>
<p>you keep tweaking things</p>
<p>with the things I mentioned you&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>to a point where when you&rsquo;re burning fat</p>
<p>you have absolutely zero cravings and</p>
<p>zero hunger and once you have that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>working it&rsquo;s going to be a lot easier</p>
<p>because trying to do this with Cravings</p>
<p>is really tough so</p>
<p>um you also probably would benefit by</p>
<p>taking some bile salts after your meals</p>
<p>because that way we&rsquo;ll give the bile to</p>
<p>start to</p>
<p>replace what&rsquo;s missing too</p>
<p>um and then one last thing which I think</p>
<p>is going to be the icing on the cake I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to mention cake but another</p>
<p>product you can order is called tadka</p>
<p>tud cup and tadka is a type of bile soap</p>
<p>that I recommend taking between meals</p>
<p>just just to help with your liver help</p>
<p>blood sugars help a lot of things and</p>
<p>help kind of keep your bile ducts open</p>
<p>and free-flowing so that&rsquo;s t-u-d-c-a</p>
<p>tadka just take two of those on an empty</p>
<p>stomach</p>
<p>um somewhere in the day not with the</p>
<p>meal</p>
<p>and then um I think those actions will</p>
<p>um put you in good shape</p>
<p>oh okay okay</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah in those artificial sweeteners yeah</p>
<p>yeah I would start doing those as your</p>
<p>uh replacement so that way you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>deprived that way you get the the</p>
<p>sensation of sweet but without the</p>
<p>actual sweet without the actual sugar</p>
<p>okay okay I&rsquo;ve been working on those</p>
<p>oh okay all right I thought that the</p>
<p>berberine would lower my blood sugar and</p>
<p>make it worse at night</p>
<p>what happens is that it&rsquo;ll help to uh</p>
<p>regulate insulin resistance which is a</p>
<p>little different and so it makes insulin</p>
<p>just work better</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re eating carbs</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re still gonna have a problem</p>
<p>through the day if you had carbs but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>what normally happens</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>with someone like you is that your liver</p>
<p>will start making</p>
<p>more sugar at night</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s called gluconeogenesis it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>make sugar and then the insulin comes in</p>
<p>there and pushes your blood sugars down</p>
<p>at night that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>counter that</p>
<p>um effect</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s really what what uh what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably running into it&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>sugar is not low because you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>low sugars it&rsquo;s coming from the insulin</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s too high because you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>carbs and also you have insulin</p>
<p>resistance so yeah</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>like 500 milligrams what time of day</p>
<p>I would do that you should probably do</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>um towards the late part of the day that</p>
<p>way all night long</p>
<p>because your your problem is like you</p>
<p>want to sleep through the night right so</p>
<p>we want to really fix this sleeping</p>
<p>because that alone will help your blood</p>
<p>sugars just by taking that stress</p>
<p>and getting you have to have a nice</p>
<p>rejuvenating sleep</p>
<p>because I know if I don&rsquo;t sleep I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>crave carbs</p>
<p>well mayor we&rsquo;re going to have to move</p>
<p>along but we appreciate your question</p>
<p>and hope that you would get back with us</p>
<p>and let us know how some of these</p>
<p>suggestions might Aid you in getting a</p>
<p>good night&rsquo;s sleep which is essential so</p>
<p>thank you so much for joining us and uh</p>
<p>you know speaking of uh bringing up cake</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t but having to do with having</p>
<p>your cake and eating it too if you look</p>
<p>up uh discipline in the dictionary you</p>
<p>will not find my picture I&rsquo;ve been one</p>
<p>of those that struggle my whole life and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting Beyond everything</p>
<p>else puts you in a position I think</p>
<p>where maybe even sticking to keto is</p>
<p>easier because you&rsquo;re confining it to a</p>
<p>certain period of time I don&rsquo;t eat until</p>
<p>the afternoon everybody has a different</p>
<p>routine I&rsquo;m not the least bit hungry</p>
<p>right now and it&rsquo;s 11 A.M my time and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like again having your cake and</p>
<p>eating it too because I&rsquo;ve never found a</p>
<p>system where I could be satisfied and</p>
<p>not torture myself all today with</p>
<p>wanting to eat anything much less junk</p>
<p>food and it&rsquo;s a terrific thing so if you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t tried intermittent fasting Dr</p>
<p>Berg style then you&rsquo;re really missing</p>
<p>out on a fantastic tool to maintain your</p>
<p>health lose tons of weight</p>
<p>etc etc</p>
<p>uh Steve just on that topic it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting because I have a friend who</p>
<p>uh is doing what he calls uh I guess he</p>
<p>coined it it&rsquo;s called Dirty fasting</p>
<p>dirty fasting that dirty kid outside so</p>
<p>I said what&rsquo;s that so he basically uh</p>
<p>eats the Nutella with the bread and uh</p>
<p>might go to McDonald&rsquo;s whatever and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll chew it enjoy it but he won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>swallow it okay so spits it out and so</p>
<p>he he said that works in fact he&rsquo;ll say</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;ll get to a point where he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>full</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not swallowing anything so he gets</p>
<p>the because a lot of the scent the The</p>
<p>receptors for these foods are in your</p>
<p>mouth right and so</p>
<p>um it works for him he does it</p>
<p>apparently he does it he can fast for a</p>
<p>whole week doing this so I probably</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t do a video on it but you know what</p>
<p>if it works um you know if you need to</p>
<p>do that</p>
<p>you have dirty intermittent fasting wow</p>
<p>audience if you see a guy spitting out</p>
<p>his french fries in line at McDonald&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll know who he is</p>
<p>right all right let&rsquo;s get on to a</p>
<p>fascinating quiz question and this is um</p>
<p>the first one of the day doc there you</p>
<p>go</p>
<p>all right uh let&rsquo;s see why do uh the</p>
<p>majority of people with gluten</p>
<p>intolerance</p>
<p>at 0 GI symptoms like they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>bloating they don&rsquo;t get abdominal pain</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have diarrhea</p>
<p>interesting okay well listen in addition</p>
<p>to our guests in The Green Room from</p>
<p>around the world let&rsquo;s go ahead and give</p>
<p>a shout out to the rest of them uh so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d like to say a good morning to all</p>
<p>of our viewers joining us today from the</p>
<p>UK thank you uh Barry we&rsquo;ll be with you</p>
<p>embry-owned guy I think I screwed her</p>
<p>name up but she&rsquo;ll straighten this out</p>
<p>in a little bit okay so from the UK</p>
<p>Canada Mexico Norway Chile the</p>
<p>Philippines Jordan Barbados the Czech</p>
<p>Republic Nigeria France India Poland</p>

<p>the longest list ever Uganda Qatar</p>
<p>Cyprus Jamaica Finland Cameroon Algeria</p>
<p>United Arab Emirates Pakistan Armenia</p>
<p>Ireland the Singapore Aruba and all</p>
<p>across the East United States I think we</p>
<p>could have a whole show and just naming</p>
<p>people that are listening but I think</p>
<p>that would get a little monotonous so</p>
<p>there you have it audience thank you all</p>
<p>so much for joining us from around the</p>
<p>world and enjoying among other things</p>
<p>intermittent fasting it&rsquo;s just so great</p>
<p>okay why don&rsquo;t we go to social media</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ve neglected thus far Louise</p>
<p>from Facebook can we order from tatka</p>
<p>and berberine from your website do you</p>
<p>have such a thing no I don&rsquo;t have those</p>
<p>products you can get them anywhere</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very available so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>certain products that are easy to get</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re pretty good quality</p>
<p>so I I wouldn&rsquo;t need to have no I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have any need to create those</p>
<p>products my the products I create are</p>
<p>mainly um either difficult to get or the</p>
<p>quality is really bad out there so um</p>
<p>but yeah you can get these anywhere</p>
<p>wonderful okay let&rsquo;s go back to social</p>
<p>media again or rather stick there for a</p>
<p>while and uh scroll up a little Kappa</p>
<p>Kappa from YouTube do you have any</p>
<p>advice on how to heal severe leaky gut</p>
<p>syndrome in an ASD child whatever that</p>
<p>is with lots of food intolerance issues</p>
<p>well the first thing you have to do is</p>
<p>avoid the things that are causing the</p>
<p>problem and I would say out of anything</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>gluten is at the top of the list so you</p>
<p>have to avoid grains</p>
<p>and start following the healthy version</p>
<p>of ketogenic diet now to heal that area</p>
<p>bone broth is something</p>
<p>um glutamate is a supplement that you</p>
<p>can get to help heal the gut and cabbage</p>
<p>juice believe it or not has uh</p>
<p>properties in there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually a little glutamate as well</p>
<p>to help heal the intestinal lining</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>uh there&rsquo;s also as far as the diet I</p>
<p>would recommend doing carnivore because</p>
<p>the fibers are going to irritate your</p>
<p>gut</p>
<p>um so that would be the best advice for</p>
<p>someone that is younger or older that</p>
<p>has leaky gut</p>
<p>if you have leaky gut you&rsquo;ve lost the</p>
<p>pneumucosal barrier that that layer of</p>
<p>mucus that um</p>
<p>makes It Wide Open to have certain food</p>
<p>particles get into your</p>
<p>body through the lymphatic system there</p>
<p>and then create all sorts of immune</p>
<p>reactions and allergies and and even</p>
<p>autoimmune problems</p>
<p>all right very good again to YouTube</p>
<p>Alma from YouTube I&rsquo;ve been on keto on</p>
<p>and off for a while thank you for your</p>
<p>honesty and I&rsquo;ve been having a lot of</p>
<p>joint pain and fatigue lately my new</p>
<p>doctor recommends going vegan do you</p>
<p>have any thoughts on the vegan diet</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s very difficult to to do and if</p>
<p>you have inflammation I I wouldn&rsquo;t go in</p>
<p>that direction simply because the uh</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of things on the vegan</p>
<p>diet that can irritate your gut and</p>
<p>increase more inflammation because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s high amounts of omega-6</p>
<p>in grains and other Foods so um and also</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re not going to be doing</p>
<p>um fish or fish oil so how are you going</p>
<p>to get your omega-6 I mean three and</p>
<p>there are you can do algae but that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little bit different</p>
<p>um as far as your your DHA and your</p>
<p>Omega your omega-3 so it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>possible uh it&rsquo;s not uh something I</p>
<p>recommend if you&rsquo;re just trying to</p>
<p>resolve inflammation</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and um vitamin D is another good</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory nutrient and high</p>
<p>amounts for inflammation</p>
<p>but watch my recent video on joint</p>
<p>inflammation because I cover all the</p>
<p>different sources and I think you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>benefit from that</p>
<p>very good okay again from social media</p>
<p>um this is a sweeping statement Holly</p>
<p>and from YouTube should high glucose</p>
<p>corn syrup be banned from American food</p>
<p>ingredients and Supply question mark</p>
<p>that would be a good idea because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in all these foods and uh it&rsquo;s so badly</p>
<p>processed and it&rsquo;s uh loaded with um</p>
<p>all sorts of things that I have no</p>
<p>benefit to your health whatsoever and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>so super concentrated</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah I I would unless you&rsquo;re putting on</p>
<p>your pancakes and using it that way I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it I&rsquo;m being very</p>
<p>sarcastic very good will Holly Ann Dr</p>
<p>Berg is on your side uh omwinga from</p>
<p>YouTube would you recommend using</p>
<p>activated charcoal when treating low</p>
<p>stomach acid and sibo</p>
<p>no I would use that more for uh toxicity</p>
<p>uh and like let&rsquo;s say you have um</p>
<p>some poison if someone&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>poison you or whatever I would take that</p>
<p>or you ate something food poisoning I</p>
<p>would take that or maybe some bloating</p>
<p>but sibo uh that&rsquo;s usually you want to</p>
<p>increase the hydrochloric acid in the</p>
<p>stomach okay so we wanted HCL</p>
<p>um butane hydrochloride and then or some</p>
<p>apple cider vinegar that will start to</p>
<p>sit up on the stomach and decrease the</p>
<p>microbes coming through the other thing</p>
<p>that I would take is some bile salts</p>
<p>because chances are you probably don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have enough and the bile salts actually</p>
<p>go through the small intestine to act as</p>
<p>a detergent to kill off these microbes</p>
<p>because you have microbes growing in the</p>
<p>wrong place and then they&rsquo;re fermenting</p>
<p>so if you add more fiber that would be</p>
<p>bad so you want to probably do carnivore</p>
<p>for a while and take the betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride but I don&rsquo;t think charcoal</p>
<p>would be the best thing to take on that</p>
<p>okay very good and Teresa this time from</p>
<p>Facebook can babies be fed whole eggs</p>
<p>now I think they would choke on it I</p>
<p>would recommend cutting up first Dr Berg</p>
<p>yeah if a baby is very very young you</p>
<p>know like I mean the breastfeeding is</p>
<p>going to be the best thing honestly and</p>
<p>then maybe when they get uh to the age</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>um 18 or a year old</p>
<p>then maybe start introducing some really</p>
<p>high quality eggs</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah at that point but um if you could</p>
<p>do breast milk that&rsquo;s going to be the</p>
<p>best thing um that you especially to</p>
<p>prevent um all sorts of problems on the</p>
<p>road like immune problems allergies and</p>
<p>uh have the best chance of um</p>
<p>having a good health</p>
<p>incredible okay uh quiz question number</p>
<p>one asked why did the majority of people</p>
<p>with gluten intolerance have zero GI uh</p>
<p>symptoms and 90 percent of our</p>
<p>respondents say it is because gluten can</p>
<p>cause inflammation in the gut and 10</p>
<p>save because the large intestine process</p>
<p>is improved by gluten-free foods no</p>
<p>answers at all excuse me that&rsquo;s it on</p>
<p>any other topic so there&rsquo;s your 100</p>
<p>percent</p>
<p>so Brett I mean uh Steve you probably uh</p>
<p>know there&rsquo;s people like bread and pasta</p>
<p>right and cereal crackers and biscuits</p>
<p>and things like that and so as soon as</p>
<p>you start getting into that area and you</p>
<p>tell people oh you shouldn&rsquo;t eat that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>literally it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re taking away a</p>
<p>big part of their life so I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>tell you something about this uh topic</p>
<p>on um on gluten that goes beyond just</p>
<p>the sugar effect the turning into sugar</p>
<p>and the weight gain and glyphosate which</p>
<p>is herbicide that&rsquo;s in the wheat and</p>
<p>things like that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>even if you do gluten-free you still</p>
<p>have those problems but gluten in</p>
<p>general is like one of the only uh</p>
<p>proteins that can&rsquo;t be fully digested</p>
<p>um and so gluten is really a complex of</p>
<p>different proteins one being a series of</p>
<p>gladness and that protein has a real</p>
<p>fascinating effect in the gut in the</p>
<p>brain</p>
<p>it stimulates the opioid receptor giving</p>
<p>you a morphine-like action</p>
<p>now why do people take morphine it&rsquo;s for</p>
<p>pain relief right</p>
<p>so what they found and I have a I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to do a video on this is that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really kind of stimulating like</p>
<p>this pain relief in your gut so you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel the symptoms going on but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going on</p>
<p>and then that gives you this idea that</p>
<p>wow maybe I&rsquo;m okay maybe I can eat that</p>
<p>bread without a problem</p>
<p>yet you have all these other issues that</p>
<p>you might not think are connected but</p>
<p>they are</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s really what&rsquo;s going on with</p>
<p>gluten and um I have a video release on</p>
<p>that and um in Europe</p>
<p>um they ferment</p>
<p>grains longer so there&rsquo;s less gluten</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s probably less issues</p>
<p>um and also they have less enrichment</p>
<p>like the iron that&rsquo;s in a lot of these</p>
<p>um grains it creates a lot of bloating</p>
<p>as well but that being said just because</p>
<p>you know you don&rsquo;t have a digestive</p>
<p>reaction doesn&rsquo;t mean that there could</p>
<p>be a problem going on and so and the</p>
<p>only reason I&rsquo;m bringing this up is</p>
<p>because I um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing a lot of DNA testing and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>finding the great majority of people</p>
<p>have gluten intolerance from a genetic</p>
<p>level</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually more common than I thought</p>
<p>interesting yeah we don&rsquo;t have a lot of</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have a lot of bloating or</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>GI problems huh which is interesting oh</p>
<p>well poor things Liberty yes from</p>
<p>YouTube here&rsquo;s some good news I have</p>
<p>been on healthy keto since November and</p>
<p>have lost 50 pounds my physician says</p>
<p>all my numbers are perfect which was not</p>
<p>the case a year ago and why I went on</p>
<p>keto 25 pounds to go uh go Liberty and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re rooting for you and of course says</p>
<p>thank you Dr Berg and as by the way tons</p>
<p>of these things flying by on the</p>
<p>comments from YouTube and Facebook we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have time to put them all and of</p>
<p>course we want to get to the things that</p>
<p>interest you but that good news should</p>
<p>be interesting because this stuff really</p>
<p>does work as is evidenced by people all</p>
<p>over the world turning in tuning in</p>
<p>excuse me okay Fannie from YouTube I</p>
<p>have kidney disease and I am on dialysis</p>
<p>what should I be doing to help heal my</p>
<p>kidneys thank you</p>
<p>I I have had several people even in my</p>
<p>clinic come come to me um on dialysis</p>
<p>usually from being a diabetic for a long</p>
<p>time and so um it really depends on what</p>
<p>stage you are as far as kidney disease</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a stage five then</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a situation you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>work with your doctor to um</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t really do you know the same</p>
<p>diet necessarily because you have to</p>
<p>avoid phosphorus and potassium and</p>
<p>things like that but if it&rsquo;s not a stage</p>
<p>five</p>
<p>um I would definitely go low carb Dr</p>
<p>Fung who&rsquo;s a kidney specialist I mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what he recommends for his</p>
<p>diabetic patients you can you know start</p>
<p>cutting down the sugars and you know you</p>
<p>might be surprised how</p>
<p>um you have kidney Improvement uh one</p>
<p>gentleman that I did work with that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not gonna</p>
<p>make any claims he was on dialysis and</p>
<p>he got to a point where he didn&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>it anymore and his doctor said you know</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re not going to do it anymore so</p>
<p>and we worked with his diet I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to say that that happens to you or</p>
<p>anyone but I think it can help and you</p>
<p>want to go low carb and do intermittent</p>
<p>fasting immediately</p>
<p>all right very good well listen up boys</p>
<p>to this question and here&rsquo;s question</p>
<p>number two Dr Burke</p>
<p>all right what is the best Trace mineral</p>
<p>to raise testosterone</p>
<p>right my pen is quivering over the paper</p>
<p>dying for the answer so answer that as</p>
<p>you always do audience and why don&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>go back to a phone call that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>gotten today from Stephanie uh and</p>
<p>Stephanie I forget where you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from Austin Texas Austin Texas good</p>
<p>for you don&rsquo;t mess with Texas and once</p>
<p>you go here with your question for um Dr</p>
<p>Berg</p>
<p>hi Dr Burke so the question is actually</p>
<p>for my mom she&rsquo;s 58 she&rsquo;s five foot five</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s 155 pounds she&rsquo;s really clean</p>
<p>salads every day lean meats intermittent</p>
<p>fasting the 18 sticks she&rsquo;s really like</p>
<p>she tries to be really healthy but</p>
<p>um the question is is that the other day</p>
<p>randomly she had said I would love to</p>
<p>experience the sensation of feeling full</p>
<p>and when we talked about that I was like</p>
<p>what do you mean and essentially she</p>
<p>said that she&rsquo;s never eaten anything in</p>
<p>her life and felt full like she can feel</p>
<p>hungry with the growling and the hunger</p>
<p>pain but she&rsquo;s never felt full before</p>
<p>like even as a child it like never even</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a full three-course meal with</p>
<p>seconds and third she doesn&rsquo;t feel full</p>
<p>when I would feel sick after all of that</p>
<p>she just doesn&rsquo;t so I was wondering</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s up with that and what she could</p>
<p>do about that so so I have a question</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>is it the feeling full or is it feeling</p>
<p>satisfied because you know eventually if</p>
<p>she keeps eating she&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>more food that can fit in there right so</p>
<p>I just asked her and she said it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>satisfied it&rsquo;s feeling satisfied yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s uh that&rsquo;s interesting um there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a couple things uh that I would bring up</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>just with animals and in insects uh if</p>
<p>you feed uh carbs to them they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna feel satisfied until they have</p>
<p>enough protein I&rsquo;m assuming that she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>eating enough protein and if she is if</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s not then that could that can</p>
<p>actually satisfy her especially the</p>
<p>amino acids especially if he has enough</p>
<p>stomach acid to break it down but the</p>
<p>typical</p>
<p>um reason for not feeling satisfied is</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s her situation but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s not uh the nutrient</p>
<p>dense foods they&rsquo;re very hard to find</p>
<p>nowadays I&rsquo;ll give you one example I</p>
<p>live in a farm</p>
<p>um I have my own chickens we have eggs</p>
<p>when my son comes over when he eats</p>
<p>those eggs he&rsquo;s a very fast metabolism</p>
<p>he can&rsquo;t he can&rsquo;t even finish like four</p>
<p>of them normally he could just keep</p>
<p>eating so when you&rsquo;re eating foods from</p>
<p>usually in the grocery store that are</p>
<p>just not as</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not grown like even the</p>
<p>vegetables aren&rsquo;t grown on soil they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>hydroponic it&rsquo;s going to be hard to be</p>
<p>satisfied because the the density of</p>
<p>nutrients aren&rsquo;t in there to satisfy</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s one thing</p>
<p>so going to Farmers Market finding</p>
<p>nutrient dense foods important</p>
<p>the other thing is if you she might need</p>
<p>more bile salts so at the end of the</p>
<p>meal</p>
<p>um adding more like adding some bile</p>
<p>salts that might help increase uh the</p>
<p>bile to extract more nutrients from the</p>
<p>fat so you get the fat soluble nutrients</p>
<p>I know I I know that that alone can</p>
<p>cause someone to just not feel satisfied</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so those are the things that I would</p>
<p>look at and then um</p>
<p>the other thing is that um</p>
<p>you know your microbiome also helps with</p>
<p>a lot of digestion and she may need more</p>
<p>probiotics too so adding probiotics at</p>
<p>night before bed or even after the meal</p>
<p>in the form of kefir playing kefir</p>
<p>um might be the ticket with some fat so</p>
<p>she has a little dish of kefir at the</p>
<p>end of the meal put some walnuts in</p>
<p>there</p>
<p>um or even</p>
<p>um macadamia nuts or even pecans and I</p>
<p>think that will that might help her</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s been listening thank you so much</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome that&rsquo;s great Stephanie</p>
<p>thanks for a great call and we&rsquo;re well</p>
<p>wishes uh to your mother and let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um we&rsquo;re waiting for some quiz question</p>
<p>answers but in the meantime the early</p>
<p>bird house what a what a handle from</p>
<p>YouTube could you please explain the</p>
<p>pros and cons of bentonite clay I am low</p>
<p>on in iron and enjoy the clay but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>feeling uh very tired these days I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how you can enjoy the clay but I</p>
<p>hope it works</p>
<p>peace</p>
<p>you know when people crave iron</p>
<p>um sometimes they crave dirt and even</p>
<p>clay</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t know if bentonite clay is the</p>
<p>best source of iron but um bentonite</p>
<p>clay is um it works</p>
<p>by not absorption by ads absorption so</p>
<p>things stick on the outside like 2 000</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>times the weight of that molecule of</p>
<p>bentamic clay just can accumulate around</p>
<p>it by kind of acting as a magnet so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really good</p>
<p>to help detox you pull toxins out reduce</p>
<p>toxicity get rid of the um</p>
<p>reactions from</p>
<p>any type of detox but it&rsquo;s also good as</p>
<p>a microbial</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>antimicrobial and so that&rsquo;s what I would</p>
<p>use it for but the fact that you are</p>
<p>iron deficient you should probably do</p>
<p>like red meat or liver and if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like that have them in a get them in a</p>
<p>like a grass-fed liver pills</p>
<p>um that would that would pretty much</p>
<p>handle anemia</p>
<p>but of course you want to find out why</p>
<p>your anemic in the first place is it uh</p>
<p>menstruating is it a problem with</p>
<p>needing</p>
<p>betaine hydrochloride which will help</p>
<p>you absorb the iron so these are all</p>
<p>things all these things that I would</p>
<p>look at</p>
<p>um first like why why you have the</p>
<p>problem in the first place but I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have enough data so we will just</p>
<p>we won&rsquo;t go there but um that that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>short answer</p>
<p>okay very good why don&rsquo;t we go to Nona</p>
<p>uh now who&rsquo;s in New Hampshire and I hope</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s warming up up there at this point</p>
<p>and Nona you are hang on let me click</p>
<p>the right button here Nona you are on</p>
<p>with Dr Berg</p>
<p>Dr Burke thank you for giving me this</p>
<p>opportunity to ask you questions</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ve started to begin with I&rsquo;m 59</p>
<p>years old I have hypothyroid I have</p>
<p>diabetes I&rsquo;m diabetic 2 type type 2</p>
<p>diabetic for almost 30 years</p>
<p>uncontrolled very very bad sugars you</p>
<p>even though I dieting all my life never</p>
<p>changed my sugar levels and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>also um so I was kind of you know very</p>
<p>worried about my health and uh 19 days</p>
<p>ago I found on a YouTube your lecture</p>
<p>about intermittent dieting and keto</p>
<p>healthy keto and you know what I so much</p>
<p>believed in you that that very next day</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>oh we lost her audio doc I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>why</p>
<p>your videos</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>my sugars for 18 days</p>
<p>I have this little meter and there is a</p>
<p>green zones so that this is a normal</p>
<p>Zone my sugars are within this</p>
<p>green</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>because I have never had it never</p>
<p>my sugar was as low as 100 yesterday and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like before if I would have it I I</p>
<p>would feel like a hypoglycemic but I</p>
<p>felt just great I eat and my sugar does</p>
<p>not go up right so I thank you for that</p>
<p>I have a question now the uh I am doing</p>
<p>uh I&rsquo;m kind of rotating one day I eat</p>
<p>one meal and another day I eat two meals</p>
<p>uh uh so when I eat two meals I eat</p>
<p>about between 11 and 12 and the next</p>
<p>meal is between four and five</p>
<p>and the uh one one meal day I ate</p>
<p>between twelve and one so I was</p>
<p>wondering does that uh this</p>
<p>inconsistency does it interfere with the</p>
<p>intermittent dieting uh is it okay to</p>
<p>have this different times like 18 and 23</p>
<p>hours yeah let me answer that because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s an important question I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s actually even better to do it</p>
<p>that way than to be</p>
<p>always exact in the same time if you</p>
<p>rotate it and you you can change it up</p>
<p>that actually will help you because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>uh if you think about</p>
<p>um our bodies were developed um not from</p>
<p>this consistent eating right or long ago</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t eat at the same time we ate</p>
<p>when we found food so our bodies are</p>
<p>designed and they do really well at uh</p>
<p>switching it up not keeping it the same</p>
<p>all the time some days two meals someday</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one meal it&rsquo;s totally fine you can</p>
<p>rotate it I mean the times I think you</p>
<p>should experiment with that but I&rsquo;m glad</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing better two-bedroom uh</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve had it for so long but yeah this</p>
<p>is the answer to</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um diabetes I&rsquo;ll tell you that so well</p>
<p>done thank you for uh coming on Nora</p>
<p>yeah we appreciate it Nora so much and</p>
<p>continue to keep in touch with us so we</p>
<p>can hear some follow-up stuff from you</p>
<p>some great answers let&rsquo;s go back uh Nora</p>
<p>and I know you&rsquo;re able to see this too</p>
<p>to our second question which asks what</p>
<p>is the best Trace mineral to raise</p>
<p>testosterone and um I&rsquo;m sure the boys</p>
<p>are particularly excited about this 75</p>
<p>percent of respondents say it&rsquo;s zinc 20</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s selenium and five percent say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s calcium</p>
<p>okay and the answer is zinc wow zinc</p>
<p>yeah zinc is uh</p>
<p>um is the best way to increase uh</p>
<p>testosterone and uh zinc has a it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably one of the most important trace</p>
<p>minerals for immune system but it also</p>
<p>helps with the sense of smell and taste</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re low in zinc there&rsquo;s a real</p>
<p>simple</p>
<p>test to determine that and it&rsquo;s called a</p>
<p>zinc test and you can get it online and</p>
<p>you just take a little bit of zinc on</p>
<p>your tongue and if you&rsquo;re deficient you</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t even taste it it&rsquo;ll taste like</p>
<p>water but if you if you have enough</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll it&rsquo;ll be like this really like</p>
<p>metallic bitter taste so that&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>really simple simple test but yeah</p>
<p>testosterone can be elevated when you</p>
<p>have zinc</p>
<p>okay very good I&rsquo;m not sure how to</p>
<p>construct this question but just sort of</p>
<p>interesting Michelle from Facebook what</p>
<p>are your thoughts about people drinking</p>
<p>their ketones from people that are</p>
<p>selling on social media does that make</p>
<p>sense can you drink ketones yeah you can</p>
<p>um you can you can get uh two different</p>
<p>types of ketones that you can buy them</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very expensive so</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s kind of um unnecessary</p>
<p>you can also take MCT oil to get ketones</p>
<p>which is a lot less expensive and</p>
<p>um or just allow your body to create its</p>
<p>own ketones from your own fat because</p>
<p>when you take ketones realize you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting the benefit</p>
<p>from ketones on your brain for sure</p>
<p>and maybe for energy but you don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>the benefit of using your own fat so you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>burn fat because your body is going to</p>
<p>use those ketones as fuel before it Taps</p>
<p>into your own fat</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ve experimented with it uh I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done the liquid ketones before</p>
<p>workouts you know you might see a little</p>
<p>change a little Improvement here and</p>
<p>there but I think it&rsquo;s not significant</p>
<p>significant enough to spend the money</p>
<p>for those ketones all right very good</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s hop on to the next question this</p>
<p>one a great relief for the audience is a</p>
<p>true false so you have a 50 chance of</p>
<p>being brilliant there you are doc</p>
<p>true or false osteoporosis is a Calcium</p>
<p>deficiency</p>
<p>okay climb on that audience and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see we talked about the ketones</p>
<p>oh here&rsquo;s one Barb from Facebook what</p>
<p>are your thoughts about using colostrum</p>
<p>to boost skin Health instead of collagen</p>
<p>well it depends if it&rsquo;s immune related</p>
<p>anything immune related you want</p>
<p>colostrum</p>
<p>collagen is not a bad thing if you want</p>
<p>to improve your gut or you know if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re not doing like a nose</p>
<p>to tail type thing you&rsquo;re not doing</p>
<p>organ meats and let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>chicken but without the skin that type</p>
<p>of thing then maybe collagen can help</p>
<p>you but the point is that the colostrum</p>
<p>is um an awesome thing for the immune</p>
<p>system you just have to be careful if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re um</p>
<p>allergic to casein or have severe</p>
<p>lactose intolerance which there could be</p>
<p>potentially some of that in there this</p>
<p>comes from dairy it could create a</p>
<p>little bit of a reaction but if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a problem with that I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really good remedy for uh severe</p>
<p>immune problems um especially if you</p>
<p>have a history of taking a lot of</p>
<p>corticosteroids and things like that or</p>
<p>prednisone</p>
<p>all right last but certainly not least</p>
<p>and I hope by pronouncing the name</p>
<p>correctly aberra is in the UK and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>unmuting her in a bear you are on with</p>
<p>Dr Berg with your one question in 30</p>
<p>seconds go</p>
<p>hi our doctor thank you so much for um</p>
<p>all your work I watch all your videos I</p>
<p>need to sometimes pull myself away and</p>
<p>just get on with my work because I can</p>
<p>watch you from morning to night</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ve just started I&rsquo;m a 52 year old</p>
<p>woman and just stopped um HRT since I</p>
<p>started the ketogenic diet and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>um what I&rsquo;m calling about today is my</p>
<p>back pain I&rsquo;ve got this back pain on the</p>
<p>upper left</p>
<p>I know you talk a lot about back pain</p>
<p>and how when you started your</p>
<p>intermittent fasting ketogenic it</p>
<p>stopped and all of that and you kind of</p>
<p>have linked it in one of your videos to</p>
<p>the to deliver right if I&rsquo;m if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>correct however</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why um I also get some kind</p>
<p>of pain at the lower</p>
<p>part of my um my abdomen</p>
<p>the lower the lower side towards the</p>
<p>right and then this back pain towards</p>
<p>the left</p>
<p>okay and just to quickly say I started</p>
<p>getting some little rashes and I know</p>
<p>you said that kind of links too</p>
<p>the liver and all of that so I just want</p>
<p>to see if you could help me okay good so</p>
<p>do you have any problems with um</p>
<p>with um endurance up going up a hill</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>um not really I don&rsquo;t live in a hilly</p>
<p>area so I haven&rsquo;t really tested that</p>
<p>okay do you have any pumpkin Walker if</p>
<p>that actually helps okay you have any</p>
<p>problems with sleeping</p>
<p>I used to but I&rsquo;m getting better</p>
<p>um since I started a keto and stopped</p>
<p>eating late</p>
<p>so last night was a bit funny but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>I I I usually don&rsquo;t sleep after teaching</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s because I get</p>
<p>all hyped up</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m an academic so but um so I I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>pinning that down to getting all hyped</p>
<p>up when I teach so uh yeah</p>
<p>yeah so that um that&rsquo;s uh more of the</p>
<p>sympathetic nervous system the flight or</p>
<p>fight which</p>
<p>um can definitely counter or inhibit the</p>
<p>digestion</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>um rare</p>
<p>um link between</p>
<p>right shoulder</p>
<p>or neck or back and heart I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your case I think what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening is that it&rsquo;s um maybe a little</p>
<p>sludge in the bile ducts because they do</p>
<p>cross over into the pancreatic ducts and</p>
<p>that could kind of create a little back</p>
<p>up into the pancreas and and the refer</p>
<p>pain because you have the phrenic nerve</p>
<p>is on both sides the right and left so</p>
<p>that can go right to the left shoulder</p>
<p>um so the remedy is the same it&rsquo;s Tut</p>
<p>cut on an empty stomach you take two in</p>
<p>the morning and then two in the</p>
<p>afternoon Tucka and that will open up</p>
<p>the bile ducts and allow things to drain</p>
<p>and that pain should go away unless</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an old injury in the area then</p>
<p>you have to you know work on the</p>
<p>opposite muscle</p>
<p>um you can do that by hanging uh with</p>
<p>your arms and stretching the latissimus</p>
<p>dorsi underneath the arm for the upper</p>
<p>back that would help that</p>
<p>um and then for the for the lower</p>
<p>abdomen I would just start working on</p>
<p>maybe a good probiotic uh working on</p>
<p>Probiotic foods like sauerkraut and</p>
<p>start to include that because that</p>
<p>sounds like there could be some some</p>
<p>help needed in that area</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s kind of what comes to mind</p>
<p>um off the bat so</p>
<p>yeah why don&rsquo;t you try that and then the</p>
<p>The Rush that I was the little rush that</p>
<p>I was saying it seems to not be going I</p>
<p>thought it was going away but it somehow</p>
<p>it comes back it&rsquo;s just a little rush</p>
<p>but I I know you talked about the skin</p>
<p>and connections with you know things not</p>
<p>working properly on the inside well yes</p>
<p>but there is a little bit of a</p>
<p>subclinical loss of bile salts which is</p>
<p>causing some of these issues</p>
<p>um one of the problems is it tends to</p>
<p>back up in the system and it can create</p>
<p>some skin rashes as well as itching</p>
<p>okay all right so like like and because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find that even the um the tank</p>
<p>cut actually is good for the skin so it</p>
<p>might kill two birds with one stone very</p>
<p>good bear thanks so much for being a</p>
<p>great representative of the UK you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>welcome and uh let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s move on</p>
<p>by the way audience I tried to wrap up</p>
<p>all our other duties except for</p>
<p>questions so we can have a</p>
<p>um a marathon of social media but let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go to the next question doc</p>
<p>okay so true or false osteoporosis is a</p>
<p>Calcium deficiency and then what did</p>
<p>everyone say</p>
<p>oh let&rsquo;s see excuse me</p>
<p>um I was worried about that uh answer</p>
<p>number three we don&rsquo;t have it yet so let</p>
<p>me put that on pause and uh</p>
<p>go back to something else</p>
<p>all right doc let&rsquo;s see uh Tina from</p>
<p>YouTube My uncured beef hot dogs contain</p>
<p>hydrolyzed corn protein and potato</p>
<p>starch are they bad for the body please</p>
<p>advise</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why they have to add those</p>
<p>fillers in there yes it&rsquo;s bad when you</p>
<p>start combining these starches</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not correct I might be wrong with</p>
<p>this but</p>
<p>I do know for a fact</p>
<p>um modified food starch</p>
<p>cornstarch maltodextrin</p>
<p>have a loophole and you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>list those as uh sugars you can list</p>
<p>them under the carbohydrate to then</p>
<p>allow you to say hey we have no sugar in</p>
<p>our food</p>
<p>um but those all three of those items</p>
<p>respond</p>
<p>way worse than sugar okay like table</p>
<p>sugar which is on the glycemic index</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s 64. well these like are in</p>
<p>the like high 90s or even over a hundred</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t help your blood sugars and</p>
<p>when you combine that with protein in</p>
<p>the hot dog not a good combination</p>
<p>um definitely not keto and um</p>
<p>probably could affect your your</p>
<p>digestion a lot I know in the past when</p>
<p>I combined meat with bread or or even</p>
<p>like meatloaf or whatever boy I would</p>
<p>just</p>
<p>not feel good or even barbecued uh ribs</p>
<p>with all the sauce the sugar sauce with</p>
<p>protein</p>
<p>I always get so tired after I&rsquo;d eat that</p>
<p>and so now I know why because it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really mix it creates a problem with</p>
<p>digestion so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t I wouldn&rsquo;t buy those hot dogs</p>
<p>very good all right well now I&rsquo;ve caught</p>
<p>up with the audience and the question</p>
<p>was true false osteoporosis is a Calcium</p>
<p>deficiency and 95 of our respondents say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s false and five percent say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>true that&rsquo;s a quite a spread there</p>
<p>well to the five percent</p>
<p>um the question is can you correct</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s true that osteoporosis is a</p>
<p>calcium efficiency can you correct</p>
<p>osteoporosis with calcium and the answer</p>
<p>is no you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;ll you you probably end up with</p>
<p>calcified</p>
<p>arteries</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>osteoporosis is a combination of</p>
<p>hormonal issues with low estrogen</p>
<p>a problem with a lack of vitamin K2 a</p>
<p>problem with a lack of</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>vitamin D</p>
<p>lack of trace minerals so it&rsquo;s a whole</p>
<p>package you can also develop</p>
<p>osteoporosis by consuming too much</p>
<p>phosphoric acid in soda</p>
<p>you can also develop it from stress so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of factors I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>release a video on this coming soon but</p>
<p>you realize Steve that over 50 percent</p>
<p>of women over the age of 50 have what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called osteopenia which is the precursor</p>
<p>to osteoporosis I I thought that was</p>
<p>excessive that&rsquo;s too many people are</p>
<p>having this problem and they might not</p>
<p>even know it they&rsquo;re not at risk for</p>
<p>fractures but it&rsquo;d be good to know if</p>
<p>you have that so you can then quickly</p>
<p>reverse it and watch stay tuned for that</p>
<p>video on how to do that coming up</p>
<p>probably sometime next week okay very</p>
<p>good now this uh next question a true</p>
<p>falseh will be of interest to people in</p>
<p>saloons around the world and there it is</p>
<p>Doc</p>
<p>okay true or false if pure alcohol</p>
<p>has zero carbohydrates okay does this</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s keto friendly</p>
<p>you folks think about that uh let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>so Ellie from YouTube what do you</p>
<p>recommend is a natural way to treat</p>
<p>someone with undifferential connective</p>
<p>tissue disease wow I I don&rsquo;t want to go</p>
<p>on any prescriptions no drugs</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s possible I think um I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the specifics on</p>
<p>the treatment or what&rsquo;s involved with</p>
<p>that but if you have</p>
<p>some disease that&rsquo;s genetic which I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>assuming it&rsquo;s genetic</p>
<p>um it doesn&rsquo;t mean you have you could</p>
<p>have that problem it really has to do</p>
<p>with the epigenetic factors mostly</p>
<p>um so I would I would um</p>
<p>Implement all the basic things that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been telling people for a long time you</p>
<p>know healthy keto with intermittent</p>
<p>fasting</p>
<p>um more fasting than usual and then see</p>
<p>what happens it just might help you</p>
<p>um many times it&rsquo;s not just a matter of</p>
<p>just consuming more protein or amino</p>
<p>acids especially with the collagen</p>
<p>disease I think you can pull off</p>
<p>Miracles if you do</p>
<p>um intermittent fasting for a lot of</p>
<p>these</p>
<p>disease is because your your genes your</p>
<p>DNA starts to kind of start surviving</p>
<p>when you start to not feed it so often</p>
<p>and this is why we see the results with</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and also the cold</p>
<p>therapy the cold bath</p>
<p>immersion tank which I&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>daily which is very interesting I like</p>
<p>it it really it&rsquo;s amazing results</p>
<p>cognitive wise inflammation wise it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>something I&rsquo;m going to be doing on a</p>
<p>daily basis so if you haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>got any information on that watch my</p>
<p>video on that all right well the</p>
<p>audience for quiz question number four</p>
<p>has thrown all their money on one number</p>
<p>and the question was true false if</p>
<p>alcohol has zero carbs does it mean that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s keto friendly and a hundred percent</p>
<p>of respondents say nah it&rsquo;s false can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get away with that</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s uh that&rsquo;s correct so we got</p>
<p>it finally got everyone had a correct</p>
<p>answer on that</p>
<p>um because it&rsquo;s keto it&rsquo;s true like if</p>
<p>keto friendly has to have low carb right</p>
<p>but um the question is is alcohol a</p>
<p>carbohydrate and the answer is no huh um</p>
<p>does alcohol have calories the answer is</p>
<p>yes it has</p>
<p>almost as much many calories as fat per</p>
<p>gram but the way the liver cells do with</p>
<p>alcohol is that it considers it a poison</p>
<p>which it is and then it it has to deal</p>
<p>with it and it has to detoxify it and so</p>
<p>it has to break it down</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>indirectly you start developing</p>
<p>um fatty liver</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>inflammation which then leads to insulin</p>
<p>resistance in the liver and then you</p>
<p>start developing</p>
<p>um scar tissue and eventually cirrhosis</p>
<p>but other than that I think you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be totally fine but um that is the</p>
<p>problem with the alcohol it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those things that people say well I&rsquo;m on</p>
<p>keto I&rsquo;m doing low carb I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>intermittent fasting then you find out</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also doing wine every other day</p>
<p>and so they in their mind they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not much sugar in there</p>
<p>but the alcohol is keeping you from</p>
<p>getting results so just another factor</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not sugar</p>
<p>that could be stopping you from getting</p>
<p>to your goal</p>
<p>all right very sorry I&rsquo;m sorry to</p>
<p>mention that because it&rsquo;s not a popular</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to become popular when</p>
<p>you tell people to stop drinking new</p>
<p>anyway but they&rsquo;re 100 correct</p>
<p>congratulations audience and here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>final true falser for the day</p>
<p>okay so true or false since the brain is</p>
<p>mostly fat</p>
<p>then photo mean that fat soluble B1</p>
<p>vitamin is good for your brain and the</p>
<p>in the brain issues</p>
<p>all right what say you audience now uh</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s do a marathon of uh social media</p>
<p>oh here we go gender from Facebook</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the best way to break a 48-hour</p>
<p>fast</p>
<p>you want to go slow have a little bit of</p>
<p>maybe a little maybe a half like a maybe</p>
<p>an egg or a little bit of salad and then</p>
<p>wait</p>
<p>for maybe a couple hours have a little</p>
<p>bit more food wait</p>
<p>and have a small portion of something</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t have carbs don&rsquo;t pig out</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you can have some issues with that I I</p>
<p>made that mistake I think I was fasting</p>
<p>48 hours and</p>
<p>I was like okay I&rsquo;m ready to eat and I</p>
<p>just started eating like way too much</p>
<p>thinking oh</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m okay and then I I got really sick so</p>
<p>um you don&rsquo;t want to do that you want to</p>
<p>ease into it especially if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>even longer fast</p>
<p>all right very good Romana from Facebook</p>
<p>has a twofer for us how can I recover</p>
<p>from PCOS and tremendous hair loss and</p>
<p>how can my mom recover lung fibrosis and</p>
<p>tongue ulcers boy that poor family</p>
<p>well the tongue ulcers can come from</p>
<p>gluten that&rsquo;s one of the symptoms gluten</p>
<p>intolerance so you have to avoid grains</p>
<p>or a B12 deficiency</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>the first problem remind me</p>
<p>PCO is trying to get rid of recover yeah</p>
<p>yeah so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s too much androgens</p>
<p>coming from too much insulin it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>simple problem to solve because you just</p>
<p>need to reduce insulin through going on</p>
<p>a low carb intermittent fasting and that</p>
<p>will bring your androgens down nicely</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the connection behind that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>inositol is a really good remedy for</p>
<p>PCOS but if you don&rsquo;t cut your carbs</p>
<p>down I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to do</p>
<p>anything for you it&rsquo;s going to be a</p>
<p>waste of money to get that but take a</p>
<p>good amount of inositol with the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet and you can say bye bye</p>
<p>to the PCOS</p>
<p>um I think that will help you greatly</p>
<p>all right once again the audience is</p>
<p>rolling the dice putting it all on one</p>
<p>number and the true false was since</p>
<p>brain is mostly fat benphotamine the fat</p>
<p>soluble B1 is good for brain tissues a</p>
<p>hundred percent of them say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>absolutely true</p>
<p>interesting because benphotamine is a</p>
<p>fat soluble B1 right</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really good for peripheral</p>
<p>neuropathy that&rsquo;s uh nerve pain in the</p>
<p>bottom of your feet or your hands</p>
<p>but apparently it doesn&rsquo;t seem to cross</p>
<p>the blood-brain barrier so it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>affect the brain it doesn&rsquo;t create any</p>
<p>significant changes in the brain</p>
<p>dysfunction that comes along with a B1</p>
<p>deficiency I recently found this out by</p>
<p>just doing a deep dive into another</p>
<p>video that I&rsquo;m going to be releasing</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um if you have</p>
<p>a lot of the deficiencies that are</p>
<p>associated with the B1 deficiency which</p>
<p>are in the brain like</p>
<p>um especially the hippocampus like</p>
<p>memory loss</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>difficulty learning brain fog</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>also Ataxia which is a gait problem</p>
<p>instead of gate and sleeping issues</p>
<p>insomnia</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;d be better taking a natural form</p>
<p>of B1 and of course I&rsquo;m not biased of my</p>
<p>own natural B1 but I do have one and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>lathionine and apparently this natural</p>
<p>B1 which is you can extract it from</p>
<p>garlic</p>
<p>is also fat soluble and it does</p>
<p>penetrate the brain and it does create</p>
<p>some cool effects</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>recently I had someone who had uh took</p>
<p>like four of them that&rsquo;s 200 milligrams</p>
<p>before bed and had the best sleep</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve ever had</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s also good for that excessive</p>
<p>thinking</p>
<p>nervous anxiety worry uh a person needs</p>
<p>B1 and get it in the natural version if</p>
<p>you take the synthetic version you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>have to take a lot more and some of the</p>
<p>synthetic B1 can actually give you</p>
<p>paradoxical type symptoms or opposing</p>
<p>additional</p>
<p>worsening of symptoms and so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some issues with that so I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>recommend that unless</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking for very short term</p>
<p>all right very good well the last</p>
<p>question of the day audience no offense</p>
<p>but wow wow wow didn&rsquo;t get that one but</p>
<p>the previous 100 correct makes it a wash</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re all great Pamela from Facebook</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that a drop of castor oil a</p>
<p>few times a day can get rid of cataracts</p>
<p>what are your thoughts I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>she was Dripping in her eye or in her</p>
<p>tongue but anyway</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t have any data on that I mean</p>
<p>it could</p>
<p>um but I know it&rsquo;s good for</p>
<p>um getting your eyelashes back</p>
<p>um so that&rsquo;s one one thing that is good</p>
<p>for I&rsquo;m not sure about cataracts</p>
<p>um but the liquid MSM is good for</p>
<p>cataracts</p>
<p>um and sometimes even floaters</p>
<p>but it penetrates the eye and it can</p>
<p>actually help</p>
<p>um but</p>
<p>yeah I I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t have any data on</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>if it can help or not very good well</p>
<p>Faith from YouTube and again our</p>
<p>thoughts and prayers go out to you what</p>
<p>would you recommend for someone with</p>
<p>stage four metastasized cancer in the</p>
<p>liver can you help with this um you know</p>
<p>for healing that&rsquo;s a terrible diagnosis</p>
<p>so if I was in that situation uh what I</p>
<p>would do as the most important action is</p>
<p>I would um</p>
<p>start fasting and it has to be the worst</p>
<p>of cancer and stage four is is bad uh</p>
<p>the longer the fast I would fast for</p>
<p>three weeks starting yesterday</p>
<p>21 days I would do that and if I could</p>
<p>go longer I would go up to even 30 days</p>
<p>or even longer the only problem is if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re very very fragile and thin and</p>
<p>old trying to do that is going to be</p>
<p>really hard because you don&rsquo;t you need</p>
<p>some fat on your body to fast</p>
<p>so um but if you can fast for a long</p>
<p>period of time you&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>creating some really powerful epigenetic</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>resistance to this cancer spreading in</p>
<p>fact I&rsquo;ve done interviews with several</p>
<p>people who had stage four cancer then</p>
<p>they did this and uh there they should</p>
<p>have been dead a long time ago and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re surviving guy tandem balm is one</p>
<p>of them and he even wrote a book on it</p>
<p>he said I interviewed him and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also a protocol that um</p>
<p>that I uh helped sponsor uh a very</p>
<p>expensive study in Europe</p>
<p>of a protocol that was very significant</p>
<p>as far as the results and you can watch</p>
<p>my video on that as well search that and</p>
<p>I talk about the results but um it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>protocol that doesn&rsquo;t have toxicity so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it was comparable the results were</p>
<p>comparable to chemotherapy wow now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not making any claims I&rsquo;m just telling</p>
<p>you what happened on mice the mice study</p>
<p>that we did so if you do have any pet</p>
<p>gerbils or hamsters that have cancer you</p>
<p>can apply that protocol interesting okay</p>
<p>well Faith we&rsquo;re certainly pulling for</p>
<p>you or your loved one that is in that</p>
<p>condition and we hope that you were able</p>
<p>to resolve that that&rsquo;s from Facebook</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been lactose intolerant since I was</p>
<p>little can you explain why magnesium</p>
<p>makes me feel sick all of the time</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know I don&rsquo;t know I think it</p>
<p>could be the form of magnesium or maybe</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need it</p>
<p>um the other thing with magnesium</p>
<p>if you are deficient in potassium and</p>
<p>you take magnesium that could make your</p>
<p>potassium efficiency a little bit worse</p>
<p>so maybe what you do is you just take</p>
<p>more potassium to see if that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>put things Back in Balance</p>
<p>all right very good</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re about to wrap up doc</p>
<p>and um well</p>
<p>yeah so um we&rsquo;re back on track we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gone for two weeks</p>
<p>um I have a lot of uh interesting videos</p>
<p>coming up uh please comment down below</p>
<p>if you have any ideas the videos that</p>
<p>you want more data on and um</p>
<p>thanks for your attention if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>listening this long and this far into</p>
<p>this show I appreciate you and have a</p>
<p>wonderful weekend we will see you next</p>
<p>week same time</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
