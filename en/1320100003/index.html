    <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Connie Loizis. And this is Alex Gove. And this is Strictly VC Download.</p>
<p>Hello, listeners. Happy New Year. Can you believe it&rsquo;s 2023? We hardly can,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s so exciting. I have to say this has been a very long week. I know I say that a lot,</p>
<p>but this week has been really, really, really long for some reason. I&rsquo;m sure the weather has</p>
<p>not helped. If you live in California, or you own a television or computer, you probably know that</p>
<p>we have been facing a pretty dramatic weather event out here this week that will continue on</p>
<p>through the weekend. And Alex and I, thankfully, we&rsquo;re not spending the week in our galoshes,</p>
<p>trying to remove buckets of water from the side of our house as happened the last time there was an</p>
<p>atmospheric river. But it was still a little bit scary. So in between work, I&rsquo;ve actually spent</p>
<p>quite a bit of time in my raincoat this week, trying to make sure that the homestead is safe.</p>
<p>In brighter news, it has been great to be back at work. Fun to see so much excitement</p>
<p>around OpenAI, whose co-founder and CEO Sam Altman has generously agreed to come to a Strictly VC</p>
<p>event next Thursday. I&rsquo;m really, really looking forward to talking to him about a whole lot of</p>
<p>things. So stay tuned for coverage of that afterward. In the meantime, we have a couple</p>
<p>of news stories for you today. And we are also featuring an interview with Peter Wagner, a</p>
<p>veteran VC who some of you may know from his days with the Silicon Valley firm, Excel. Peter</p>
<p>co-founded around 10 years ago, another venture fund called Wing Venture Capital. And Wing does</p>
<p>a lot of interesting stuff, including most recently, to put together a list of some of</p>
<p>the top enterprise focused angel investors for its benefit and the benefit of everyone else who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>investing in the enterprise space and wants to know who the right people are to get in front of.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to be publishing that list in TechCrunch. So keep your eyes out for that.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we also caught up with Peter about just a few broader market</p>
<p>trends that we hope that you will enjoy. And now some of those news pieces.</p>
<p>It was only a matter of time, I suppose. While the machines haven&rsquo;t quite taken over yet,</p>
<p>in today&rsquo;s Forbes, Thomas Brewster writes about how hackers are now using chat GPT to write reams</p>
<p>and reams of malicious software in the blink of an eye. Apparently, some cyber criminals are asking</p>
<p>OpenAI&rsquo;s tool to create software that will install malicious code in an unsuspecting user&rsquo;s computer.</p>
<p>Others have employed it to create their own drug marketplace, a la Silk Road.</p>
<p>And Alex Holden, founder of cyber intelligence company HoldSecurity, said he&rsquo;d seen bad guys</p>
<p>plug chat GPT into chatbots on dating sites in order to keep conversations moving. Israeli</p>
<p>security vendor Checkpoint says the kinds of chat GPT malware they&rsquo;ve seen have been pretty basic</p>
<p>so far, but they warn that the software will make it much easier for novice programmers to launch a</p>
<p>scam. However, an even greater risk than malware could be criminals who use chat GPT to orchestrate</p>
<p>social engineering attacks, which were responsible for 20 percent of all data breaches in 2022,</p>
<p>according to a study by Verizon. As Rick Ferguson, vice president of security intelligence at</p>
<p>American cybersecurity company Forescout, told Forbes, it could industrialize the creation and</p>
<p>personalization of malicious webpages, highly targeted phishing campaigns, and social engineering</p>
<p>reliance scams. I asked chat GPT what it thought about all this, and instructed it to write up its</p>
<p>reply in the form of a Shakespearean sonnet. Here goes. Oh chat GPT, I&rsquo;m sorry, I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hear you. Oh chat GPT, thou art a tool of great renown, a software that can write with speed and</p>
<p>ease. But in the hands of those with wicked clown, thou art a weapon, a dangerous disease.</p>
<p>Cybercriminals seek to use thy might to spread their malice far and wide, installing code that</p>
<p>does not seem right, and creating markets dark and hide. But worse than malware thou can create</p>
<p>is the power to orchestrate attacks so sly, to industrialize scams that mislead and bait,</p>
<p>and breach data with cunning lies. Oh chat GPT, thy power is vast and grand,</p>
<p>but be aware of those who seek to command.</p>
<p>Over the last decade or so, many VCs have built vast personal fortunes. Some of the money has</p>
<p>been made through investments in companies that have outperformed, but much of their wealth</p>
<p>traces to management fees that added up quickly as fund sizes, raised in faster succession than</p>
<p>ever in history, ballooned to unprecedented levels. Given that the market has changed and</p>
<p>will likely remain a tougher environment for everyone for at least the next year or two,</p>
<p>one obvious question is what happens now? Will the industry&rsquo;s limited partners, the so-called</p>
<p>money behind the money, demand better terms from their venture managers, just as VCs are</p>
<p>right now demanding better terms from their founders? Well, if ever there was a moment for</p>
<p>the institutions that fund VCs to use their leverage and push back on how funds are raised,</p>
<p>or the industry&rsquo;s lack of diversity, or some of the hurdles that have to be reached before profits</p>
<p>can be divided, now would seemingly be the time to do that. Yet in numerous conversations with</p>
<p>LPs this week, the message that I heard was the same. LPs don&rsquo;t dare rock the boat and put their</p>
<p>allocation in so-called top-tier funds at risk. But what if they had more backbone? What if they</p>
<p>could tell managers exactly what they think without fear of retribution? What would they</p>
<p>change if they had their druthers? Well, for one thing, weird terms. According to one limited</p>
<p>partner, in recent years, so-called time and attention standards, which is language in limited</p>
<p>partner agreements meant to ensure that the people involved will devote substantially all of their</p>
<p>business time to the fund they&rsquo;re raising, began to appear less and less frequently before vanishing</p>
<p>almost completely. Part of the problem is that a growing number of general partners actually</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t focused exclusively on their funds. They had, and they continue to have, other day jobs.</p>
<p>The LPs also said they found the hyper-fast fundraising environment fairly annoying.</p>
<p>Many of them were receiving routine distributions in recent years, but they were being asked to</p>
<p>commit to new funds by their portfolio managers nearly as fast as they were cashing those checks.</p>
<p>Indeed, as VCs compressed these fundraising cycles, instead of every four years, for example,</p>
<p>they were returning to LPs every 18 months, and sometimes even faster for new fund commitments.</p>
<p>It created a lack of time diversity for their investors. Said one manager, quote,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re investing these little slices into momentum markets, and it just stinks because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no price environment diversification. Some VCs invested their whole fund in the second half</p>
<p>of 2020 and the first half of 2021, and it&rsquo;s like, geez, I wonder how that will turn out.</p>
<p>Not last, according to several LPs, a lot of arrogance crept into the equation.</p>
<p>One of them told me that certain general partners would be like, take it or leave it. The LPs argued</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a lot to be said for an even, measured pace for doing things, and that as</p>
<p>pacing went out the window, so did mutual respect in some cases. All that said, the limited partners</p>
<p>and others who fund the venture industry might grow less timid over time. In the conversation</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re about to hear with Peter Wagner, for example, he observes that during the dot-com crash,</p>
<p>a number of venture firms let their LPs off the hook by downsizing the size of their funds.</p>
<p>Excel, where Wagner had spent many years as a general partner, was among those outfits.</p>
<p>Wagner doubts the same will happen now, but if returns don&rsquo;t hold up, LPs could get fed up and</p>
<p>demand some concessions. Indeed, Wagner said he wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised at all if</p>
<p>more favorable LP terms were up for discussion in the next year or two.</p>
<p>Up next, Connie&rsquo;s interview with Peter Wagner of Wing Venture Capital.</p>
<p>But first, a word from our sponsor. It&rsquo;s a fact, sustainable companies are over</p>
<p>5% more profitable than their competitors. You too can become more profitable by making</p>
<p>business decisions with the environment in mind using Sustain Life. Sustain Life&rsquo;s software makes</p>
<p>measuring, managing, and reporting emissions easy. To book a demo and get started on your path</p>
<p>to net zero, go to sustain.life.com. And now, here&rsquo;s Connie&rsquo;s interview with Peter</p>
<p>Wagner of Wing Venture Capital. You have so many different interesting</p>
<p>deals. I see Vivo Therapeutics, which is this in vivo drug discovery platform,</p>
<p>DeepGram, a startup that focuses on building custom voice recognition models for customers,</p>
<p>including Spotify. How do you explain your mission statement to startups?</p>
<p>And what are you looking for in 2023? We think of our mission as helping people do</p>
<p>their best work. And so we do this in a couple of ways. One is by investing in companies that</p>
<p>are building out what we call the AI first technology stack. We&rsquo;re big believers that</p>
<p>AI is not replacing humans, but that humans working with AI replace humans that don&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>with AI. And so that set of products really empowers customers to do more and to reach</p>
<p>their full potential. And then for us specifically as an investor, we&rsquo;re helping the founders that</p>
<p>we work with build the best companies and accomplish more than they otherwise would</p>
<p>be able to. That&rsquo;s the heart of a great partnership. So that whole notion of helping</p>
<p>founders and their customers do their best work to the application of AI first technologies,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really my mission statement. And that is a lot of what is driving enterprise technology</p>
<p>these days is how do I develop and apply that set of AI first technologies to drive business results?</p>
<p>And I think if you were going to highlight any particular super important movement in</p>
<p>enterprise, that would be it. The information I&rsquo;ve written a pretty</p>
<p>interesting story, I think in late December about a company that focused on marketing, Jasper. It</p>
<p>was relying on OpenAI&rsquo;s GPT-3 language model. And then chat GPT came out and it&rsquo;s so strong</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s free for now. And it&rsquo;s really causing Jasper to try to find new footing. And I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>wondering if you are seeing ripple effects, I guess, specifically from OpenAI, but also whoever</p>
<p>is hot on its heels. It just seems like we could also see the network effects of these giant</p>
<p>companies getting bigger and crushing everyone else along the way.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, crushing them or enabling them. The industry foundation models,</p>
<p>if you use that term to describe what OpenAI and others are putting there,</p>
<p>these are super powerful. But what it does is it creates opportunities for startups to build</p>
<p>around them and on top of them and add value to them. This makes those models more useful</p>
<p>in specific use cases, more useful to specific customers. So I think of just the amazing</p>
<p>developments amongst these foundation models is like the creation of the microprocessor,</p>
<p>the creation of the PC. And these were enabling technologies. Did the emergence of the PC</p>
<p>destroy industries or allow new ones to come into being? A little of both, but much more on the</p>
<p>latter. Right? Right. Think of all the companies and the different types of software products and</p>
<p>other industries that were born because of this enabling technology. And so somebody like Jasper,</p>
<p>just to stick with your example, they need to figure out how to add value around the OpenAI</p>
<p>family of models. And if you can&rsquo;t do that, then you don&rsquo;t have a company. But I think what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>seeing is that many founders are finding ways to extend and add adaptation layers and workflow</p>
<p>around the foundation models to really drive business outcomes and users will pay for that.</p>
<p>Also, in terms of these foundation models driving business outcomes, I would assume that you need</p>
<p>fewer people because of the power of these models. So is that being reflected in the amounts of money</p>
<p>that people are raising? People in the startup, you mean? Yeah. Well, you certainly don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>people going and recreating the work that OpenAI has done, but you need people doing other stuff.</p>
<p>So again, if I go back to my chip analogy, it used to be, if you were a computer company,</p>
<p>you had to develop a microprocessor. That was part of what IBM and Digital and others that</p>
<p>preceded Intel were doing. But then when commercial microprocessors came out and became sufficiently</p>
<p>powerful, then the computer industry no longer was spending time developing microprocessors,</p>
<p>but they were developing a lot of other things added up to a more complete product, a more usable</p>
<p>product. So I think you&rsquo;d see resources shift. They take advantage of the enabling technology</p>
<p>and then their resources are allocated elsewhere. So I don&rsquo;t necessarily think it means that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s fewer people in the company. I think it means you&rsquo;re doing different things. I would</p>
<p>certainly at least hope so, because if that&rsquo;s not the case, then it might be that your value</p>
<p>add is relatively thin. Right. And then Peter, just heading into 2023, what is changing? Are</p>
<p>terms changing much at the seed level at which you&rsquo;re playing? Are valuations much more reasonable?</p>
<p>Are you concerned about the economy right now? Do you think it&rsquo;s going to be a slow year or that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be fine in another six months? Well, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to be fine in another six months.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re in for a bit of an extended bottoming period. I don&rsquo;t know exactly how long,</p>
<p>but if prior experience is any guide, we could bump along in a bottoming period here for a year</p>
<p>or two. That doesn&rsquo;t have to be doom and gloom though. If you look back historically, many of</p>
<p>the best companies that were really of enduring value, they were actually built or formed, I should</p>
<p>say, during these bottoming periods. So if you look at say companies that were founded in 2002,</p>
<p>just to pick a cohort, that ended up being a particularly exceptional group of companies.</p>
<p>And so why is that? Well, one is, I think it has to do with founder makeup and the makeup</p>
<p>of the early teams. These weren&rsquo;t tourists. They knew it was going to be difficult. So</p>
<p>they were doing it with the right mindset, fully expecting some challenges, prepared to take on</p>
<p>those challenges. You might say they were gritty and hearty and pure of heart. And then the way</p>
<p>the companies were built, they had to be very frugal and they had to be focused on value</p>
<p>propositions that made sense even when customers were being really cautious with their spending.</p>
<p>That level of focus and that level of efficiency and that level of clarity around the value</p>
<p>proposition pays dividends over the long term. So I think this is actually a really good time,</p>
<p>not breathless and prolific time, but can be a really productive time to be starting companies</p>
<p>and investing in early stage companies. But you have to know what you&rsquo;re doing. And I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a little harder to read some of these signals than maybe when everything is going up into the right.</p>
<p>You know, terms are certainly resetting. Deals are not closing in three days, but I think this is</p>
<p>healthy. It&rsquo;s allowing founders to get to know their prospective investors in a more substantive</p>
<p>way. It&rsquo;s allowing investors to do high quality work, standing the opportunity. So those don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to be negatives. Do you think we&rsquo;re going to see firms raise smaller funds all of a sudden,</p>
<p>or maybe just space out their fundraising? Well, I think certainly there&rsquo;ll be spacing out. That</p>
<p>was really unhealthy. The idea of coming back to raise a new fund every year or two, that type of</p>
<p>time compression is not good for anybody. So we&rsquo;ll certainly see that. Will the funds themselves</p>
<p>shrink? I&rsquo;m not so sure about that. What drove the increase in fund size in the first place?</p>
<p>Part of it was a proliferation of strategies. We saw especially big venture platforms expanding</p>
<p>their product lines, you know, sector funds, growth stage funds, international funds of</p>
<p>various sorts. And I think that&rsquo;ll be sticky in many cases. I think we will see deal sizes</p>
<p>perhaps normalize a bit. So the really enormous late stage financings might&hellip; What&rsquo;s the term</p>
<p>you use in Strictly VC? Oh, big but not crazy big fundings? Massive fundings? Yeah, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that whole hierarchy, which I find very funny, right? So maybe we&rsquo;ll see everybody move down</p>
<p>a click in your hierarchy. But the huge fundings were supply side driven, right? It wasn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>the companies needed that capital. And a lot of that capital is still sitting on balance sheets.</p>
<p>It was really just because investors were trying to deploy capital that would only be accommodated</p>
<p>by the companies because the terms were so favorable to them. As terms reset, there&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be less appetite for the really huge round and you&rsquo;ll see less capital deployment. So I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll certainly happen. If you go back to the early 2000s after the dot-com bust, we actually</p>
<p>did see large fund size reductions. And not only that, but we saw capital that had been raised</p>
<p>actually released. So maybe somebody had raised a billion dollar fund and turned out they couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>invest that. Well, Excel, you were with Excel and Excel did that. Yeah, absolutely right. Yeah. And</p>
<p>so we ended up releasing a large fraction of Excel 8 and other firms did the same. But I think what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happened now that was different then is you have people on a multi-strategy approach. At Excel at</p>
<p>that time, we were a pure play around early stage. Excel today, you&rsquo;re doing growth stage investing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing a number of different strategies. And so I think you&rsquo;ll have maybe capital finding</p>
<p>new strategies. And I&rsquo;m sure you probably even reported on this, how some managers were</p>
<p>deploying into the public markets with capital that was raised. I think that&rsquo;s a bad idea. If</p>
<p>I was an LP, I wouldn&rsquo;t be happy about that. But I think that&rsquo;s just an example of that capital</p>
<p>is more likely to be deployed in different strategies than it is to be released.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really interesting point because I was wondering six months ago, I guess,</p>
<p>if we were going to see some of that and I was waiting and obviously nobody has made a similar</p>
<p>gesture as Excel did 20 years ago. And maybe that explains it. They&rsquo;re just finding other</p>
<p>ways to put that money to work. And so not returning it. It may be that the returns will</p>
<p>be poor. And so then perhaps future fund cycles will be less well-received because of a move like</p>
<p>that. But as you know, that takes quite a number of years to play out. LPs have to be very careful</p>
<p>about not burning bridges. And so it&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine that they&rsquo;re going to be asking for</p>
<p>better or different terms than they&rsquo;ve been receiving, except maybe for the poorest performing</p>
<p>managers or possibly, unfortunately for newer managers who don&rsquo;t have much of a track record.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just wondering, can you imagine them using this moment in the same way that VCs are</p>
<p>telling their startups, look, we expect better terms here. Do you think that LPs would find the</p>
<p>backbone to say to VCs, look, we want better or different terms here? I think that could happen</p>
<p>in some cases. And again, it takes a while for this to play out, right? It&rsquo;s usually the next</p>
<p>fund cycle when that conversation can come. And if the next fund cycle is several years from now,</p>
<p>we might be in a different economic environment. So perhaps the moment will have passed,</p>
<p>but I wouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprised if that was under discussion in the next year or two.</p>
<p>Well, I really appreciate your time and it&rsquo;s great to catch up for a few minutes. And I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>excited to take a longer look at this list that you&rsquo;ve put together. And I&rsquo;m sure again,</p>
<p>that readers and listeners will be excited to see it. Cool. Okay. Thanks so much, Connie.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. Thanks for listening. And a special thanks to sustain.life. Please check it out</p>
<p>at sustain.life slash StrictlyVC. Have a great weekend, stay dry, and we&rsquo;ll see you back here</p>
<p>next week.</p>
