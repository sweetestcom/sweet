<p>thank you</p>
<p>hey everyone welcome back we&rsquo;re here for</p>
<p>another q a anything that I say is not</p>
<p>going to replace your medical care or</p>
<p>cure you check with your doctor before</p>
<p>implementing any of these suggestions</p>
<p>these alternative natural suggestions</p>
<p>um so that&rsquo;s my disclaimer and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sticking to it Steve what&rsquo;s the latest</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on over there well as you</p>
<p>know we have all sorts of wonderful</p>
<p>things each week on the show we have our</p>
<p>quiz questions which are very exciting</p>
<p>we have a brilliant audience that</p>
<p>answers them quickly we have people in</p>
<p>the green room and then of course your</p>
<p>monologues and all of social media we</p>
<p>really love hearing from them but in</p>
<p>this case we&rsquo;ve got one person</p>
<p>participating Glory I&rsquo;m not going to try</p>
<p>to say her last name but I do know she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>from Pennsylvania she&rsquo;s a school teacher</p>
<p>and she has a little monster somehow in</p>
<p>the back room so we&rsquo;re going to get to</p>
<p>her first so that she can get back to</p>
<p>the very Noble work that she does in</p>
<p>educating America&rsquo;s Youth and with that</p>
<p>Gloria you&rsquo;re on with Dr Berg</p>
<p>hi Dr Berg thank you for having me sure</p>
<p>my question is my alkaline phosphatase</p>
<p>have been very elevated for three years</p>
<p>now and they&rsquo;ve been treating me with a</p>
<p>prescription called your cidal and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>to water down the bile because they said</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s backing up that gets in my system</p>
<p>um there I&rsquo;ve had many tests many blood</p>
<p>work and no one can tell me exactly</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s causing that so I want to heal my</p>
<p>body naturally and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m coming</p>
<p>to you because I love your videos and I</p>
<p>and I admire everything that you do</p>
<p>hey thanks I appreciate that</p>
<p>um when did you first notice did you</p>
<p>what kind of symptom did you initially</p>
<p>noticed to find out wow I need to go</p>
<p>test my my liver I just went for a</p>
<p>regular blood work three years ago and</p>
<p>it has really no symptoms no</p>
<p>and still no symptoms my weight goes up</p>
<p>and down I&rsquo;m 118 now but it I went up to</p>
<p>137 it comes back down to 120 so I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if the weight has anything to do</p>
<p>with it as well okay and did they find</p>
<p>um uh</p>
<p>they just found this uh positive enzyme</p>
<p>liver problem but they didn&rsquo;t do any</p>
<p>other test right they did tests on my</p>
<p>bones to see if it was a bone disease</p>
<p>they said that either it&rsquo;s a bone</p>
<p>disease or a liver disease they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>calling it liver disease but because</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t give me a diagnosis they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>calling it fatty liver disease</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not really what I have</p>
<p>okay the one thing about the the liver</p>
<p>um is it really doesn&rsquo;t give you any</p>
<p>symptoms until later so</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s kind of good that this showed up</p>
<p>just so you can start working on your</p>
<p>liver a liver is the only organ that uh</p>
<p>can completely 100 percent rejuvenate</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uh rough it&rsquo;s rugged so I would</p>
<p>start taking milk thistle right away</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one thing and tadka which will</p>
<p>help to thin the bile because that liver</p>
<p>enzyme is usually involved with with a</p>
<p>backup of more of the bile ducts and the</p>
<p>that which the the Tucka is a natural</p>
<p>way of thinning the bile but then the</p>
<p>milk thistle will actually protect</p>
<p>uh the liver and bring down those</p>
<p>enzymes and then of course I&rsquo;m assuming</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing the healthy version of</p>
<p>ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting</p>
<p>hopefully you are and you can</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;ve been intermittent fasting all</p>
<p>my life and didn&rsquo;t even know it so</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t eat lunch until maybe 12</p>
<p>1 right that&rsquo;s great if you get in a</p>
<p>ketogenic diet you&rsquo;re going to find your</p>
<p>liver enzymes probably will be much much</p>
<p>better in a couple months because</p>
<p>um reducing the carbs is going to take a</p>
<p>big stress off the inflammation in the</p>
<p>liver and one thing that&rsquo;s cool if you</p>
<p>do have any fat and liver which I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if you do you have to do an</p>
<p>ultrasound for that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find that within even two weeks</p>
<p>you can reduce uh like 50 of the fat off</p>
<p>the liver if you do the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>correctly so</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a lot of things you can do</p>
<p>for the liver but I would stick with the</p>
<p>tadka the milk thistle and I would do</p>
<p>low carb and then uh then get it</p>
<p>retested I think that enzyme will come</p>
<p>down but um there&rsquo;s not a lot of things</p>
<p>you can do medically</p>
<p>to reverse liver disease because</p>
<p>everything is involving toxicity so</p>
<p>um really the natural way is the best</p>
<p>way to approach this and a lot of the</p>
<p>foods that are good for the liver are</p>
<p>like the precipitous vegetables the</p>
<p>micro greens the Sprouts um and and</p>
<p>healthy proteins like eggs and uh things</p>
<p>like that too eggs are really good for</p>
<p>the liver</p>
<p>um and so is grass-fed beef that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really good for liver too because it has</p>
<p>the choline which will protect the liver</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>uh yeah those those are the things that</p>
<p>I would suggest and I think that that</p>
<p>can turn things around for you now</p>
<p>because the uricidal does water down the</p>
<p>bile should I stop that and just take</p>
<p>the tatka you know it&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>of the that&rsquo;s a really good question</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t tell you not to take it but</p>
<p>I would just research the side effects</p>
<p>from that and then research tadka and</p>
<p>then you make make up your own mind</p>
<p>based on the data because I I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be pleasantly surprised uh if you</p>
<p>look look at the wider viewpoint on this</p>
<p>and uh you know side effects and</p>
<p>benefits</p>
<p>okay and my one last thing how many</p>
<p>milligrams of each of milk thistle and</p>
<p>Tucka</p>
<p>well I don&rsquo;t they they always come in</p>
<p>different amounts so I would just simply</p>
<p>follow the directions on the label and</p>
<p>whatever it&rsquo;s recommended I would take</p>
<p>that okay thank you which I appreciate</p>
<p>your advice sure no problem that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>Gloria it&rsquo;s always sort of you know</p>
<p>upsetting to hear that your liver</p>
<p>enzymes uh are kind of elevated but</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s truly horrifying is middle school</p>
<p>kids so good luck to you as you go back</p>
<p>to them or whatever grade you are</p>
<p>dealing with that&rsquo;s a wonderful Pursuit</p>
<p>and uh we&rsquo;re going to bounce right over</p>
<p>to this week&rsquo;s first quiz question and</p>
<p>Dr Burke here it is</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>if women have a genetic mutation for</p>
<p>breast cancer</p>
<p>why do some women get cancer and others</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>I mean if you have a genetic problem for</p>
<p>cancer that</p>
<p>increases the risk well I mean what</p>
<p>determines what is that determining</p>
<p>Factor whether you get it or you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get it</p>
<p>is it just luck or is there another</p>
<p>reason</p>
<p>well I hope you all find out okay let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go to social media and this is from</p>
<p>YouTube kicking off from YouTube Monica</p>
<p>wants to know are there any solutions to</p>
<p>getting rid of granuloma annular</p>
<p>sickness ever heard of that Don</p>
<p>you know uh just vaguely but I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have any experience and I actually I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know other than the fact that I</p>
<p>would recommend</p>
<p>implementing the basic basic eating plan</p>
<p>as a as the most important thing for any</p>
<p>of these conditions just simply because</p>
<p>um the significance and the importance</p>
<p>of that diet is like way way more than</p>
<p>the average person thinks so I would I</p>
<p>would get on the basics and then see</p>
<p>what happens but I don&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>experience in or any results in that</p>
<p>condition at all so unfortunately I have</p>
<p>no comment on that all right well Monica</p>
<p>best of luck on that do your research</p>
<p>and then let&rsquo;s stay on YouTube with Amy</p>
<p>uh I am now 50 and taking 300 milligrams</p>
<p>of niacin to lower my cholesterol can I</p>
<p>take it every day for the long term is</p>
<p>that good stuff she&rsquo;s doing yeah yeah</p>
<p>you can you can because uh</p>
<p>um this very minimal side effects at</p>
<p>that amount at that amount I mean and um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really a a very uh well-researched</p>
<p>molecule</p>
<p>in the area of cholesterol and lipid</p>
<p>profile so</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s just a lot a lot behind that</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a great thing I I honestly</p>
<p>um I would also add to that a natural B</p>
<p>complex because and I&rsquo;m not biased of my</p>
<p>own in the keto energy but the B complex</p>
<p>helps to</p>
<p>you know anytime you take one B vitamin</p>
<p>out of the complex</p>
<p>you know we don&rsquo;t know but there could</p>
<p>be like um some alteration in some of</p>
<p>the other factors so as long as you take</p>
<p>some some base of bees I think you&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>even better off than just taking one</p>
<p>specific vitamin to address that that</p>
<p>cholesterol</p>
<p>wonderful wish you all the best okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s stay on social media and</p>
<p>um my thing just flip down oh here we go</p>
<p>chocolate chip from YouTube my husband</p>
<p>um cookie dough no I&rsquo;m kidding my</p>
<p>husband has three simple cysts on his</p>
<p>liver uh we&rsquo;ve reviewed your liver</p>
<p>videos but can&rsquo;t find any that address</p>
<p>this condition can you please address</p>
<p>this issue</p>
<p>I think this is another reason to</p>
<p>download that free app because I uh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard to find my videos sometimes on</p>
<p>YouTube but I did several videos on cyst</p>
<p>the the body&rsquo;s trying to wall off some</p>
<p>infection or microbe or toxin or</p>
<p>something like that it&rsquo;s a protective</p>
<p>mechanism</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the best thing to do is to search out my</p>
<p>videos I think it might be under uh</p>
<p>biofilms but that being said</p>
<p>um I would follow the protocols</p>
<p>or the liver body type and I have videos</p>
<p>on that and do that for a period of time</p>
<p>because uh sometimes those cysts can go</p>
<p>away sometimes they don&rsquo;t because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re benign at least you won&rsquo;t grow</p>
<p>new ones but it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s the body&rsquo;s</p>
<p>protective</p>
<p>mechanism and people get them in the</p>
<p>kidneys as well</p>
<p>um by the way tatka has some interesting</p>
<p>research also relating to decreasing</p>
<p>cysts as well</p>
<p>But realize that&rsquo;s just a remedy you</p>
<p>want to implement the diet make sure the</p>
<p>diet is the first thing you implement</p>
<p>all right very good well we have others</p>
<p>in The Green Room that are all across</p>
<p>the contiguous United States but guess</p>
<p>who else is joining us and we&rsquo;d like to</p>
<p>say a hearty welcome to uh people</p>
<p>calling in or watching or listening from</p>
<p>the UK Canada Mexico Cambodia Australia</p>
<p>Romania the Virgin Islands Colombia</p>
<p>Slovenia Poland Spain Norway the</p>
<p>Dominican Republic Autry uh Tria thank</p>
<p>you Terry</p>
<p>um he&rsquo;s always giving me phonetically</p>
<p>spell things because he knows me a South</p>
<p>Africa France Nigeria the Netherlands</p>
<p>Japan Ethiopia Germany Belgium Greece</p>
<p>Italy Egypt Sweden Brazil Bermuda</p>
<p>Portugal Nepal India Pakistan</p>
<p>aubergine he put here at well moving on</p>
<p>Kazakhstan Peru Russia Taiwan</p>
<p>Switzerland and all across the United</p>
<p>States as I mentioned thanks to</p>
<p>everybody and no doubt we&rsquo;ll have some</p>
<p>more people chiming in to say hi from</p>
<p>their various country Nations around the</p>
<p>world okay as we expected the audience</p>
<p>is very Adept and leaps right on these</p>
<p>questions and the first question asked</p>
<p>if a woman has a genetic mutation for</p>
<p>breast cancer why do some get cancer and</p>
<p>others luckily do not seventy percent of</p>
<p>our respondents say lifestyle and</p>
<p>dietary choices under like Mr a</p>
<p>chocolate chip cookie up there</p>
<p>and 15 say environmental influences and</p>
<p>15 say a diet high in sugars</p>
<p>are they under something</p>
<p>you know they are they&rsquo;re all onto</p>
<p>something and it&rsquo;s really the epigenetic</p>
<p>that means above phonetic those are the</p>
<p>things that control it that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>lifestyle the environment and even the</p>
<p>and believe it or not the mindset of the</p>
<p>person that&rsquo;s like a huge huge probably</p>
<p>the most important thing because if you</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Steve have you ever</p>
<p>heard about that experiment where you</p>
<p>take two separate plants grown by in the</p>
<p>same soil</p>
<p>same seed same environment but with one</p>
<p>plant</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re giving it compliments all day</p>
<p>long and the other one you&rsquo;re in you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just critical fault finding whatever</p>
<p>this other plant and you know there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>huge difference in the growth of just by</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s saying these things to the</p>
<p>plan so just think about what people do</p>
<p>themselves right they um sometimes they</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have positive thoughts about</p>
<p>themselves so that mindset being</p>
<p>positive and having a good um strong</p>
<p>will over things uh control over your</p>
<p>mind is a probably the most important</p>
<p>thing this is probably why some people</p>
<p>can get away with</p>
<p>smoking drinking</p>
<p>um and they don&rsquo;t seem to have any</p>
<p>problem other people do</p>
<p>but um the point is that the epigenetics</p>
<p>which is a is like your lifestyle it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what you your environment the stress</p>
<p>your foods</p>
<p>that is the stuff that um you can&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>with breast cancer they don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>emphasize it it&rsquo;s all about well let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>get early testing let&rsquo;s remove the</p>
<p>breast tissue let&rsquo;s put you in drugs</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>do more testing mammograms and create</p>
<p>more trauma it&rsquo;s like what about the</p>
<p>epigenetics let&rsquo;s focus on that I really</p>
<p>think you could literally</p>
<p>um bring down that risk factor close to</p>
<p>zero if you just change your lifestyle</p>
<p>um so whether you get a test for these</p>
<p>genes or not</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s a good idea just to change your</p>
<p>lifestyle right now</p>
<p>um but sometimes Steve this might be</p>
<p>hard to believe some people don&rsquo;t always</p>
<p>change when you tell them the first time</p>
<p>um you must have to kind of repeat it a</p>
<p>few times</p>
<p>uh Lori my wife&rsquo;s been trying out her</p>
<p>entire course of our marriage good luck</p>
<p>right I know it&rsquo;s usually your spouse&rsquo;s</p>
<p>but uh</p>
<p>we know personally we just jump right on</p>
<p>at the first time we&rsquo;re told absolutely</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always compliant although my house</p>
<p>plants appear to be staring at me now</p>
<p>Doctor Who made me nervous all right so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go on with another question since</p>
<p>they did so well with that and here it</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>okay what is the best</p>
<p>food to eat if you have a genetic marker</p>
<p>for breast cancer</p>
<p>okay folks jump on that</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s go back to social media</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many great questions on there</p>
<p>I wish we could get to all of them but</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take Carolyn from Facebook do you</p>
<p>have an opinion on internal parasites</p>
<p>and diatomaceous earth</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good remedy it&rsquo;s a very good</p>
<p>remedy for parasites it works um these</p>
<p>parasites are exposed to this thing and</p>
<p>it literally</p>
<p>Cuts their internal if it just destroys</p>
<p>them from the inside out so it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really good um</p>
<p>crystallized powder that will you can</p>
<p>use for insects and even parasites um</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a good remedy um but</p>
<p>parasites we all have them to a certain</p>
<p>degree it&rsquo;s just a matter of keeping our</p>
<p>our defenses against them and so the</p>
<p>best thing is to take</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>a good probiotic Reed foods that are</p>
<p>filled with probi probiotics like the</p>
<p>sauerkraut the kimchi um kefir those</p>
<p>type of things but there&rsquo;s other</p>
<p>remedies to</p>
<p>um the black walnut Hall extract garlic</p>
<p>a really good remedy for parasites but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s many different plant-based herbs</p>
<p>that are anti-parasitic but build up</p>
<p>your gut and then also good stomach acid</p>
<p>by maybe taking the supplement butane</p>
<p>had a chloride is another really good</p>
<p>thing too make sure you don&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>parasites that slip through the barrier</p>
<p>of the stomach acid when you eat Foods</p>
<p>all right very good a gi7 is a moniker</p>
<p>from this person on YouTube I&rsquo;ve been on</p>
<p>omad for almost a year now but I find</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m cold all the time what can I do</p>
<p>to overcome this reaction I could she</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t mention or they didn&rsquo;t mention</p>
<p>whether they lost weight or not but</p>
<p>skinny people get colder faster</p>
<p>typically if you&rsquo;re on keto and you get</p>
<p>cold you just need more B1 B1 tends to</p>
<p>handle</p>
<p>um the tolerance to extreme temperatures</p>
<p>as well as to help increase the if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re too cold so like let&rsquo;s say for</p>
<p>example for some reason</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve heard about this great therapy of</p>
<p>an ice bath that ice bath therapy right</p>
<p>and for some reason you just can&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just too painful uh it could be</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re B deficient</p>
<p>um or you go on the sun and you you get</p>
<p>overheated easily that&rsquo;s a B1 deficiency</p>
<p>so we got B1 and then also iodine so</p>
<p>from sea kelp might also help you those</p>
<p>two things</p>
<p>okay here&rsquo;s an interesting question Gail</p>
<p>from Facebook do you have any advice for</p>
<p>someone who has to take meds at a</p>
<p>certain time while trying to do keto and</p>
<p>if she didn&rsquo;t mention the medications</p>
<p>you got to be pretty healthy to take</p>
<p>medication nowadays so um what I would</p>
<p>do</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and I had a video on this for those</p>
<p>people who take medication you should</p>
<p>also</p>
<p>you know and I don&rsquo;t have any specific</p>
<p>advice when you should take it maybe</p>
<p>with meals or without I think more</p>
<p>importantly is to take things that will</p>
<p>help</p>
<p>decrease the complications of</p>
<p>medications to especially your liver and</p>
<p>kidney and that would be</p>
<p>um some of these uh these phytonutrients</p>
<p>like milk thistle milk thistle is a</p>
<p>plant that has a certain</p>
<p>uh phytonutrient that kind of</p>
<p>counteracts</p>
<p>all the free radical damage and toxicity</p>
<p>and things like that so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I like milk this so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the it&rsquo;s a perfect antidote for</p>
<p>poisoning like if you happen to be</p>
<p>poisoned for some weird reason just gets</p>
<p>to milk thistle real fast or if you had</p>
<p>a snake bite</p>
<p>milk thistle or maybe a tarantula you</p>
<p>know you have around the clock crawling</p>
<p>in your house</p>
<p>make sure you have plenty of milk</p>
<p>thistle to counteract the the Venom</p>
<p>very good by the way Dr Burke had a</p>
<p>lighting expert come into his uh place</p>
<p>there in his camera shot just looks</p>
<p>fabulous good for you doc so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>worth their uh their time okay we leave</p>
<p>no one out shout out to our viewers also</p>
<p>in the Philippines Jordan Sri Lanka</p>
<p>Israel the United Arab Emirates Trinidad</p>
<p>and Tobago Amman Kuwait and last but not</p>
<p>least Guyana so welcome folks if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>any other there</p>
<p>shout out Terry we&rsquo;ll type your name in</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll make sure we acknowledge you</p>
<p>Andrea can hyperthyroidism excuse me</p>
<p>hypothyroidism poison I&rsquo;m not doing it</p>
<p>today turn into Hashimoto&rsquo;s I said that</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>well it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily turn into it</p>
<p>but you can have uh most lost 90 percent</p>
<p>of the time it&rsquo;s if you have</p>
<p>hypothyroidism it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s so it&rsquo;s really it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>really a thyroid issue it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>autoimmune problem that&rsquo;s affecting the</p>
<p>thyroid so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>is a little different</p>
<p>correction that I would recommend so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d want to take more selenium than</p>
<p>iodine for that but you all some iodine</p>
<p>will be helpful but not too much so I</p>
<p>did a whole video on that but really</p>
<p>many times it starts in the gut and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s definitely this interesting</p>
<p>connection between the gluten in the</p>
<p>grains and things things like that that</p>
<p>you definitely need to avoid like the</p>
<p>plague</p>
<p>okay very good Judy from YouTube why am</p>
<p>I experiencing diarrhea on the carnivore</p>
<p>diet I was on ketovor if you acknowledge</p>
<p>that DOC for a year and then switched</p>
<p>over to carnivore it&rsquo;s been easy except</p>
<p>for the pesky diarrhea</p>
<p>the only connection that I can think of</p>
<p>with that is that um</p>
<p>your microbes are are not able to</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>be supported like maybe some of the</p>
<p>fiber in the vegetables because these</p>
<p>microbes tend to eat fiber as the</p>
<p>primary fuel they can eat some collagen</p>
<p>and things like that but uh</p>
<p>but the fiber is what helps to give to</p>
<p>feed them and to help</p>
<p>um as a Prebiotic you know you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really think of meat as a Prebiotic</p>
<p>um and also um if you&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>carnivore</p>
<p>um are you on it because you have gut</p>
<p>issues if you are then you better find</p>
<p>out how to do it correctly because</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to just have</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>um animal meats you want to have like</p>
<p>the eggs a fish you want to have like</p>
<p>organ meats you might want to do um</p>
<p>shellfish Seafood things like that</p>
<p>and that should help you</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah uh that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what I would</p>
<p>recommend</p>
<p>all right well the audience had a</p>
<p>recommendation for answers for the</p>
<p>second question today which asks what is</p>
<p>the best food to eat if you have a</p>
<p>genetic marker for breast cancer</p>
<p>and the audience wasted no time with 65</p>
<p>65 percent of our respondents saying is</p>
<p>cruciferous vegetables 20 say grass-fed</p>
<p>beef ten percent say oregano oil and</p>
<p>ginger and then the final five percent</p>
<p>say sulfurophane</p>
<p>well everyone is right for sure and</p>
<p>sulforaphane is one of the</p>
<p>phytonutrients in like broccoli sprouts</p>
<p>and cabbage but the cruciferous</p>
<p>vegetables some hands down have the most</p>
<p>potent uh potent remedies based on</p>
<p>research for cancer especially breast</p>
<p>cancer why because</p>
<p>from many angles one it acts to inhibit</p>
<p>this uh this little enzyme called</p>
<p>aromatase</p>
<p>is responsible from converting</p>
<p>testosterone and testrogen so if you can</p>
<p>inhibit that you&rsquo;ll get less estrogen</p>
<p>also</p>
<p>um the phytoestrogens in the cruciferous</p>
<p>act two</p>
<p>um balance the estrogen so you go from</p>
<p>the stronger estrogen to the weaker ones</p>
<p>and the more protective ones and the</p>
<p>cruciferous have stimulate</p>
<p>um your own body&rsquo;s genes to detoxify</p>
<p>things that can cause cancer so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>very on many different levels it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>best thing and I think it&rsquo;s not hard to</p>
<p>do and let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>I know this might be shocking some</p>
<p>people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like vegetables in which case they</p>
<p>can do the the sprouts and all you need</p>
<p>is a small amount of sprouts to equal</p>
<p>the the same phytonutrient benefits as a</p>
<p>large amount of adult</p>
<p>vegetables so anyone can do that</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what I would recommend</p>
<p>okay here&rsquo;s an important question I</p>
<p>think from YouTube what are the best</p>
<p>foods to address depression what a</p>
<p>rotten condition that is</p>
<p>the first thing that comes to mind would</p>
<p>be vitamin D</p>
<p>a vitamin D</p>
<p>um there is another remedy</p>
<p>that has been known to be very very</p>
<p>effective and it&rsquo;s called methyl</p>
<p>methylene blue</p>
<p>methylene blue I&rsquo;m going to release a</p>
<p>video on that</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s the first synthetic drug that</p>
<p>ever was developed in medicine</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some interesting properties</p>
<p>um it will make your urine turn blue but</p>
<p>apparently it&rsquo;s really good for</p>
<p>depression</p>
<p>but vitamin D D is uh really key</p>
<p>um also light therapy</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and that would be the most potent so</p>
<p>what foods are high in vitamin D well</p>
<p>you have you have salmon cod liver oil</p>
<p>things like that but there&rsquo;s not a lot</p>
<p>of foods that have vitamin D in them so</p>
<p>um enough anyway so you might want to</p>
<p>just take that as a supplement like at</p>
<p>least 20 000 IUS</p>
<p>now if that is your problem right and</p>
<p>you take like</p>
<p>2 000 I use a vitamin B3 and you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>yeah I tried vitamin it didn&rsquo;t work well</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of</p>
<p>evaluations in um people that have DNA</p>
<p>problems and I&rsquo;m finding hands down the</p>
<p>great majority of the great majority of</p>
<p>them nearly always have problems with</p>
<p>vitamin D in the converting the inactive</p>
<p>to the active in the absorption which</p>
<p>means that the average person that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>tested at least needs to take a larger</p>
<p>amounts of vitamin D than they were</p>
<p>before to create the effects that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to create so depression</p>
<p>anti-inflammation immune system</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>very very important</p>
<p>be very good and folks I do recommend uh</p>
<p>Dr Berg&rsquo;s D3 and K2 because it&rsquo;s 10 000</p>
<p>IUS a lot of times you&rsquo;d have to eat a</p>
<p>whole handful of stuff from the uh you</p>
<p>know the local supermarket to achieve</p>
<p>that level and uh Dr Berg&rsquo;s done a lot</p>
<p>of research on this and there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>that supports it online so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great one and again Dr Burke&rsquo;s so shy to</p>
<p>push his own products but we all think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re great and so uh you know go to</p>
<p>drberg.com and get a bucket full of that</p>
<p>stuff like I did and I feel great and</p>
<p>Braun we really hope that you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re well supported and Overcoming</p>
<p>Depression because that is no way that</p>
<p>is no fun it&rsquo;s no way to go throughout</p>
<p>the day so we wish you well and hope</p>
<p>that you write us back and let us know</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we go out to California and</p>
<p>talk to uh shradda cool name she&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>California it&rsquo;s very early out there so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to put her on the ear now</p>
<p>please go ahead with your one question</p>
<p>in 30 seconds strata you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>hello Dr Berg</p>
<p>um my question for you is for the past</p>
<p>four months I&rsquo;ve been having a</p>
<p>distressed gut</p>
<p>um a lot of bloating inflammation</p>
<p>multiple things might be going on my</p>
<p>general physician was suspecting</p>
<p>diverticulitis some kind of sibo</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ve been on keto intermittent</p>
<p>fasting prolonged fasting on and off</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m vegetarian and it&rsquo;s hard for me</p>
<p>to sustain just on keto</p>
<p>I wanted to check with you I&rsquo;ve lost a</p>
<p>ton of weight in the past four months</p>
<p>four months like about 15 pounds or so I</p>
<p>wanted to get your opinion on how I can</p>
<p>heal myself naturally especially given</p>
<p>that I have that vegetarian restriction</p>
<p>and going forward with keto for my</p>
<p>natural healing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably the hardest question the</p>
<p>hardest the biggest problem to solve is</p>
<p>if someone has gut issues typically they</p>
<p>they have inflammation in the gut</p>
<p>possibly and that they do they need to</p>
<p>do carnivore but they want to do</p>
<p>carnivore but they&rsquo;re a vegetarian or a</p>
<p>vegan so how do we do carnivore being a</p>
<p>vegan that is the question but you said</p>
<p>vegetarian right so you&rsquo;ll eat eggs</p>
<p>right I&rsquo;ll eat eggs yes</p>
<p>thank you you just solved the problem</p>
<p>there yeah</p>
<p>um if you just you should do an</p>
<p>experiment for two days just eat eggs</p>
<p>only and see if your gut problems go</p>
<p>away</p>
<p>and if they do</p>
<p>then I need to</p>
<p>um dense you</p>
<p>to change a little bit but are you doing</p>
<p>it for what what&rsquo;s the main reasons why</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>um this vegetarian diet</p>
<p>tried I&rsquo;ve tried giving giving it a</p>
<p>chance but it just makes me nauseous I</p>
<p>mean I&rsquo;m just not very I have a mental</p>
<p>block I&rsquo;m not able to</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about nauseousness</p>
<p>that you just don&rsquo;t like I&rsquo;m not able to</p>
<p>ingest any kind of meat at all I give it</p>
<p>a shot it doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>so so</p>
<p>um this is a better reason than some</p>
<p>other reasons simply because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some other reasons it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>hard it&rsquo;s harder to overcome but I I did</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>evaluate someone fairly recently</p>
<p>same exact problem and they just every</p>
<p>time they meet they they just have</p>
<p>problems right they have like a reflux</p>
<p>or they have nausea or they have well</p>
<p>guess what</p>
<p>that means that they don&rsquo;t have the pH</p>
<p>in the stomach to tolerate me to digest</p>
<p>meat and if you try to eat meat without</p>
<p>enough acid oh my goodness you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to reject it like crazy you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>feel terrible and then you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>decide to become a vegetarian</p>
<p>um what happens is that stomach pH is</p>
<p>not acid you also can absorb minerals so</p>
<p>you become anemic you can&rsquo;t um</p>
<p>tell off microbes so there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>problems so here&rsquo;s what I would do if I</p>
<p>were you I would start taking betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride</p>
<p>as a supplement maybe two or three with</p>
<p>a male just before you eat just like</p>
<p>maybe spread it out like with one bite</p>
<p>pick another one chew it swallow it take</p>
<p>another one pick three and then each</p>
<p>meal increase one more of that retained</p>
<p>hydrochloride until</p>
<p>this bloating thing goes away I think</p>
<p>your main problem is just not enough</p>
<p>stomach acid and that&rsquo;s creating all the</p>
<p>digestive issues</p>
<p>and then what might happen over a period</p>
<p>of two months is you may be able to</p>
<p>start adding more different types of</p>
<p>protein into your diet whether it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>fish maybe some type of lamb or meat</p>
<p>but do it slowly because I think without</p>
<p>that stomach acid you&rsquo;re going to have a</p>
<p>problem</p>
<p>um that might be the biggest clue what</p>
<p>you just told me but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah because of what you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>through right now is um there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>things so many things in the diet if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a vegetarian that are going to</p>
<p>bloat you right</p>
<p>um let&rsquo;s assume if I want to start from</p>
<p>right now you said I should start the</p>
<p>butane hydrochloride two or three pills</p>
<p>per day if I&rsquo;m just doing eggs</p>
<p>um how many eggs can I do like I mean</p>
<p>for my weight 100 pounds</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>how many meals a day you&rsquo;re doing two</p>
<p>meals</p>
<p>um I try to do two meals but when I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing intermittent fasting on omad</p>
<p>um for the rest of the days uh but for</p>
<p>two or three days I&rsquo;m doing two meals</p>
<p>okay so um see how much see how you feel</p>
<p>by having three or four eggs and you do</p>
<p>can that would that be enough uh meal</p>
<p>for you or would you need currently I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing up to two eggs</p>
<p>um and so far it&rsquo;s working okay uh good</p>
<p>you can increase it to three to four and</p>
<p>see how you feel uh maybe you put some</p>
<p>ghee on it yeah you can do me right yeah</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s salt and pepper and uh</p>
<p>actually it&rsquo;s sounding pretty good to me</p>
<p>um yeah that&rsquo;s what I would do um but I</p>
<p>really think eggs are really easy to</p>
<p>digest but um</p>
<p>that betaine hydrochloride I think</p>
<p>probably</p>
<p>has been missing for your whole life and</p>
<p>so now it&rsquo;s like okay your body is just</p>
<p>not designed to do that so you want to</p>
<p>acidify that slowly over a period of</p>
<p>time and then Watch What Happens you</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t you won&rsquo;t react to protein in fact</p>
<p>you might even crave it great thank you</p>
<p>so much Dr Borg you&rsquo;re welcome our</p>
<p>guests are behaving so well with their</p>
<p>concise question which keeps things</p>
<p>interesting we have time for things like</p>
<p>this now I sent this picture to Dr bird</p>
<p>bragging last night about my final if</p>
<p>meal and uh hoping for some uh you know</p>
<p>great praise he said where&rsquo;s where&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>salad</p>
<p>Dr Burke have you seen that have you</p>
<p>seen the price of lettuce these days</p>
<p>well done Steve you&rsquo;ve done good that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great okay the the brownie was just off</p>
<p>screen no I did quite well yesterday so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very proud of that okay let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>really good yeah wonderful that&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>was looking for here&rsquo;s our next question</p>
<p>so why does a vitamin B1 deficiency</p>
<p>cause a per cause a person more stress</p>
<p>more flutter flight mode</p>
<p>so why does that deficiency create more</p>
<p>stress in your body when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deficient</p>
<p>okay what&rsquo;s happening climb on it</p>
<p>audience I know you got an answer let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see</p>
<p>um bill from YouTube what&rsquo;s the best way</p>
<p>to treat colitis</p>
<p>by uh avoiding something not by taking</p>
<p>anything and this is this is an</p>
<p>interesting thing with the gut</p>
<p>inflammation</p>
<p>the only people I say what can I take</p>
<p>for it no it&rsquo;s what to avoid because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating something that&rsquo;s creating</p>
<p>inflammation and usually it could be</p>
<p>some</p>
<p>um something involving like the omega-6</p>
<p>fatty acids like oils soy oil canola</p>
<p>corn things like that and that would be</p>
<p>in fried foods stuff like that or the</p>
<p>grains</p>
<p>um or beans</p>
<p>or possibly even certain grains and</p>
<p>vegetables so</p>
<p>um watch my videos on that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a process of elimination start</p>
<p>eliminating things and see what makes</p>
<p>you better</p>
<p>um I had</p>
<p>mysterious inflammation in my gut as I</p>
<p>was</p>
<p>consuming on a regular basis one of</p>
<p>those long French bread you know</p>
<p>baguettes whatever you call them I mean</p>
<p>I would just down one of those and you</p>
<p>know without even thinking twice not</p>
<p>even connecting that could be causing</p>
<p>inflammation when I was severely</p>
<p>um intolerant to gluten so gluten in the</p>
<p>grains</p>
<p>is one of the only proteins that humans</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t Digest</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t digest it it and you have a</p>
<p>lot of it</p>
<p>even though it makes that bread nice and</p>
<p>gooey and delicious boy it just it comes</p>
<p>with a price</p>
<p>um sourdough bread has a lot less of it</p>
<p>because of the fermentation so this is</p>
<p>why like um</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t react as much with the</p>
<p>sourdough not that I&rsquo;m recommending it</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just kind of giving you</p>
<p>how you reduce it</p>
<p>all right very good Linda from YouTube</p>
<p>is 73 and has been diagnosed with</p>
<p>crohn&rsquo;s ouch I&rsquo;ve been taking d3k2 and</p>
<p>your gallbladder formula since I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have one but I&rsquo;m experiencing a lot of</p>
<p>joint pain uh what do I need to do</p>
<p>a lot of the absorption of the omega-3</p>
<p>fatty acids like from cod liver oil</p>
<p>or fish oils happens in the gut so you</p>
<p>might have some malabsorption so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking the the bile salts that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some other things that could</p>
<p>be causing this stiffness and arthritis</p>
<p>Etc</p>
<p>it could come from oxlets from spinach</p>
<p>or almonds or certain nuts</p>
<p>so if you have arthritis or stiffness I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re going to be the most uh</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be safest if you stick</p>
<p>with um</p>
<p>like some really Basic Foods</p>
<p>like certain types of salad that are</p>
<p>like a wide variety of different salads</p>
<p>and um meat</p>
<p>um grass-fed grass finish beef you know</p>
<p>sardines</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Seafood shellfish and then keep it like</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t add too many nuts don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>add too many other things and um Dairy</p>
<p>might even be an issue with you so keep</p>
<p>it simple and see if it doesn&rsquo;t go away</p>
<p>from that</p>
<p>okay very good let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um Rachel from Facebook when I&rsquo;m fasting</p>
<p>should I just stop taking vitamins</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s if you&rsquo;re doing long-term</p>
<p>fasting</p>
<p>um you you want to take vitamins because</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know if you have that Reserve</p>
<p>left in your body if you&rsquo;re low on</p>
<p>especially like</p>
<p>um electrolytes for example or the B</p>
<p>vitamins and you do a fast and you do it</p>
<p>for three days what&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re going to be very deficient</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to do as well you take</p>
<p>the vitamins and nutrition while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fasting then you&rsquo;re protected now</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>intermittent fasting is completely</p>
<p>different you know because you could</p>
<p>potentially you eat certain foods can</p>
<p>get the majority of your</p>
<p>nutrients from those foods but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>easy you gotta really know you know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s in what I mean especially like</p>
<p>the food nowadays like where are you</p>
<p>getting your iodine where are you</p>
<p>getting your selenium</p>
<p>um things like that are not easy to get</p>
<p>okay very good uh audience as usual is</p>
<p>on it are recent our number three</p>
<p>question asked why does vitamin B1</p>
<p>deficiency cause a person more stress</p>
<p>more flight or fight mode and the</p>
<p>audience is in complete agreement 100 of</p>
<p>our respondents say B1 calms the nervous</p>
<p>system and helps control our cortisol</p>
<p>levels thus the deficiency a deficiency</p>
<p>naturally creates stress</p>
<p>yes but there&rsquo;s another mechanism that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually very interesting I want to</p>
<p>share with you I&rsquo;ll do a video on this</p>
<p>as well a B1 deficiency</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>creates huge problems in certain parts</p>
<p>of your brain especially the brain stem</p>
<p>the brain stem is very vulnerable to a</p>
<p>vitamin B1 deficiency and the symptom</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to get is almost</p>
<p>identical to a hypoxia in the brain</p>
<p>which is a lack of oxygen</p>
<p>so think about this Steve</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t get enough oxygen let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>being choked or you&rsquo;re underneath water</p>
<p>um wouldn&rsquo;t that necessarily trigger the</p>
<p>stress response a little bit ugh</p>
<p>certainly would</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s what happens so if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not getting B it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>getting oxygen and it&rsquo;s like panic panic</p>
<p>attacks adrenaline not sleeping can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>breathe that well</p>
<p>this is why when you&rsquo;re under stress B1</p>
<p>is like I would get a natural one is the</p>
<p>best thing to take</p>
<p>the nutritional yeast or or some other</p>
<p>way but it really brings the stress down</p>
<p>very quick pulls people out of this the</p>
<p>sympathetic dominant flight or fight</p>
<p>mode and um</p>
<p>in addition to controlling your</p>
<p>breathing B1 is like the next best thing</p>
<p>for stress</p>
<p>okay uh let&rsquo;s do our first true Foster</p>
<p>today and it&rsquo;s asking the following</p>
<p>there you go Dr Berg all right here we</p>
<p>go true or false apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>helps prevent and break down kidney</p>
<p>stones</p>
<p>is that true or false well I hope it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>true that sounds great</p>
<p>okay Loretta from Facebook is coconut</p>
<p>oil high in omega-6</p>
<p>no no it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it&rsquo;s a good thing</p>
<p>to cook with</p>
<p>um and so no it&rsquo;s not high in six</p>
<p>um more of a saturated fat and then the</p>
<p>unsaturated fat the ones that are very</p>
<p>susceptible to oxidation are like um the</p>
<p>soy the corn the canola the cotton seed</p>
<p>the safflower the sunflower those are</p>
<p>very very</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um inflammatory</p>
<p>um and they&rsquo;re um they go bad real quick</p>
<p>and they can go rancid but we process</p>
<p>the heck out of them and when you eat</p>
<p>those oils you&rsquo;re eating something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really refined in a concentrated</p>
<p>amount it doesn&rsquo;t have like the</p>
<p>phytonutrients</p>
<p>um that it started out with to counter</p>
<p>all these complications of oxidation for</p>
<p>radical damage and that type of thing so</p>
<p>um just like even with with fruit people</p>
<p>say well uh what&rsquo;s so wrong with high</p>
<p>fructose corn syrup if you know fructose</p>
<p>is in corn I mean I&rsquo;m sorry fructose is</p>
<p>in fruit</p>
<p>uh why why</p>
<p>um why can&rsquo;t I have fructose in high</p>
<p>fructose corn syrup because fruit also</p>
<p>has the phytonutrients to protect you</p>
<p>from all the side effects from that</p>
<p>fructose</p>
<p>interesting uh for the benefit of our</p>
<p>audience could you expand on omega-6 I</p>
<p>take it that&rsquo;s not good and where would</p>
<p>you find that what foods</p>
<p>omega-6 is one of those things one of</p>
<p>those types of fats that has been</p>
<p>introduced in our diet fairly recently</p>
<p>um because of the shift of saying well</p>
<p>saturated fats are bad so everyone needs</p>
<p>to switch to unsaturated footpaths but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the problem we need a ratio of</p>
<p>like a one to one</p>
<p>of omega-6 to Omega-3</p>
<p>omega-3 I like the cod liver oil the</p>
<p>fish oil right</p>
<p>so we need this ratio but an average</p>
<p>American has it&rsquo;s like I think it&rsquo;s at</p>
<p>least</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t correct me but I mean correct you</p>
<p>can correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong but I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 25 to 1. it&rsquo;s up there it could be</p>
<p>it could be 50 to 1 for some people but</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re so heavy on the omega-6 fatty</p>
<p>acids that um</p>
<p>they can it competes with the Omega-3</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why not only do you have to</p>
<p>take more omega-3 but you also have to</p>
<p>avoid the omega-6</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s really easy to do and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being very sarcastic because if you</p>
<p>go to the grocery store try to find a</p>
<p>food that doesn&rsquo;t have omega-6 in it so</p>
<p>um the salad dressings the mayonnaise</p>
<p>all these other Foods they have like</p>
<p>even um</p>
<p>um hummus</p>
<p>no longer do they put olive oil they put</p>
<p>safflower oil or corn oil in there where</p>
<p>soy oil and here you are consuming so</p>
<p>much of that so we&rsquo;re consuming way too</p>
<p>much of this six and this is creating uh</p>
<p>problems with um your eyes called uh</p>
<p>macular degeneration creating artery</p>
<p>problems</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s the thing these omega-6s are</p>
<p>fats and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re worse than sugar because they</p>
<p>get lodged in our cell membranes in our</p>
<p>brain brains for a lot longer than sugar</p>
<p>sugar doesn&rsquo;t really get stored</p>
<p>at all it&rsquo;s like you can exercise it off</p>
<p>but these oils can stay in your body for</p>
<p>up to 600 days ouch so you can imagine</p>
<p>it takes a while to get it out of the</p>
<p>system okay very good well uh boy the</p>
<p>audience is astute as always they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>ripping through these questions and this</p>
<p>is a true false or apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>helps prevent and break down kidney</p>
<p>stones and the audience 95 of them</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>uh say it&rsquo;s true and five percent are</p>
<p>holding out and say nope</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true it&rsquo;s I found a really good</p>
<p>study on that and because I&rsquo;ve been I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been really promoting</p>
<p>um when if you have a kidney stone add</p>
<p>that lemon juice right the lemon juice</p>
<p>because the citrates which are really</p>
<p>important and um and avoid oxalates</p>
<p>but apple cider vinegar just happens to</p>
<p>which is acetic acid</p>
<p>happens to affect the genetics your</p>
<p>genes it&rsquo;s an epigenetic factor to</p>
<p>greatly improve the reabsorption of</p>
<p>citrates</p>
<p>the citrates are the thing that will</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s kind of like a chelator it kind</p>
<p>of binds with the calcium in your urine</p>
<p>and then it makes it so it can&rsquo;t bind</p>
<p>with the oxalates so now you don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t develop kidney stones so if you</p>
<p>have a kidney stone usually you have a</p>
<p>high oxalate high calcium and low</p>
<p>citrate those are the three things</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>this is a really uh simple thing to do</p>
<p>so you have this in the in the morning</p>
<p>when you have your water or whatever and</p>
<p>you put the lemon in it</p>
<p>um just add the apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>always with it too because there&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>the combination is going to help you and</p>
<p>then I I put my um electrolyte powder</p>
<p>not that I&rsquo;m biased at all but the</p>
<p>electrolyte powder also has um</p>
<p>several forms of minerals and the</p>
<p>magnesium and potassium come in a</p>
<p>potassium citrate magnesium citrate so</p>
<p>you get you get this alkalization</p>
<p>fact</p>
<p>um which will actually help you even</p>
<p>more because a lot of times these Stones</p>
<p>develop in an acidic environment and so</p>
<p>if we alkalize it with the citrates now</p>
<p>we now we have this powerful effective</p>
<p>compounding effect over kidney stones</p>
<p>okay very good uh audience we have 15</p>
<p>minutes left and here&rsquo;s the plan we want</p>
<p>to make sure we get to all our questions</p>
<p>so first off we&rsquo;re going to have Dr uh</p>
<p>Berg read this out then we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>go to our green room and get Natalia and</p>
<p>Kim and then we&rsquo;re going to have a uh</p>
<p>absolute marathon of social media so if</p>
<p>you all can rip this out quickly we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to get back to social media and</p>
<p>wrap the show up with that so Dr Berg</p>
<p>there is our final question for the day</p>
<p>okay why is milk better than water in</p>
<p>kind of neutralizing this Burning effect</p>
<p>when you after you eat hot peppers</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;ve ever eat some hot have you</p>
<p>ever eaten hot peppers Steve oh my God I</p>
<p>love it burn my lips off</p>
<p>yeah and then you ever drink water right</p>
<p>after that well yeah it&rsquo;s been as a kid</p>
<p>I got trapped you know suckered into</p>
<p>eating something gruesome but in the</p>
<p>meantime I&rsquo;ve really been able to</p>
<p>tolerate I love spicy food and I guess</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really bad for you is it yeah</p>
<p>on average</p>
<p>right and then the water actually makes</p>
<p>it worse out so uh the question is why</p>
<p>would milk uh help reduce this burning</p>
<p>sensation versus water that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>question and I want to</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an interesting answer so I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to see if you guys know it already I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>just bet you the audience knows that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific okay now uh Kim we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to go to you in Los Angeles and</p>
<p>Kim asks you to be brief with our short</p>
<p>time left so one question in 30 seconds</p>
<p>go</p>
<p>hello I&rsquo;m so excited okay so basically</p>
<p>for about the last four months or so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been waking up with heart</p>
<p>palpitations and uh it was kind of worse</p>
<p>in the beginning and then</p>
<p>um I went to the doctor they did blood</p>
<p>tests and then he said oh I also have</p>
<p>high blood pressure or not high blood</p>
<p>sugar and high cholesterol so</p>
<p>um and they&rsquo;re sending me to a sleep</p>
<p>study and they&rsquo;re also sending me to a</p>
<p>Cardiologist just to make sure</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s okay so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my story</p>
<p>um but I&rsquo;m wondering like trying to be</p>
<p>brief so like I&rsquo;m wondering like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>literally waking up and I have to</p>
<p>breathe it down it got it was worse but</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s getting a little bit better</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m trying to you know take some</p>
<p>of your stuff that you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>okay good so um here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>would recommend</p>
<p>um I would recommend</p>
<p>um potassium a lot of potassium and</p>
<p>magnesium it&rsquo;s an electrolyte powder</p>
<p>that would I think that&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>important but if we take a look at</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s behind that usually what</p>
<p>depletesio potassium is that either</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not consuming enough of the right</p>
<p>Foods or you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>assuming too many carbs which deplete</p>
<p>your potassium so I would definitely get</p>
<p>on the healthy version of Keto</p>
<p>immediately with the electrolyte powder</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to help softening</p>
<p>soften the arteries to help blood</p>
<p>pressure but more importantly it&rsquo;ll feed</p>
<p>the um the pacemaker</p>
<p>the electrolytes that you need to keep</p>
<p>the heart in rhythm</p>
<p>so that being said</p>
<p>um yeah it&rsquo;s only I&rsquo;m sorry it&rsquo;s only at</p>
<p>night is there a reason why it&rsquo;s only at</p>
<p>night yeah there is uh there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the other reason why</p>
<p>people get more cramps at night you know</p>
<p>and they have more problems with uh</p>
<p>breathing at night there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>circadian rhythm effect that</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t want to go into the</p>
<p>complexity of it but that affects your</p>
<p>mineral levels more in the night during</p>
<p>the day and that&rsquo;s probably why</p>
<p>everything is exaggerated at night yeah</p>
<p>and sometimes also</p>
<p>some people don&rsquo;t even feel them at</p>
<p>night</p>
<p>um one last thing to check for</p>
<p>um with heart palpitations is that I</p>
<p>have an EMF tester I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>around here an EMF tester I wish I had</p>
<p>it I could show you but um yes I did</p>
<p>that I watched one of your videos and I</p>
<p>did that I&rsquo;m sleeping on the opposite</p>
<p>side of my bed now like my head&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>my feet are and I noticed I was using my</p>
<p>computer a lot and there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>frequency coming from this huge plug-in</p>
<p>thing so I&rsquo;m like oh gosh that I mean so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another thing I&rsquo;m paying</p>
<p>attention to so yeah</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s um I had the I had electric</p>
<p>I had this hard Rhythm thing and I I</p>
<p>realized</p>
<p>um it the wall right in back of me had</p>
<p>electromagnetic fields that extended</p>
<p>eight feet from the wall so I literally</p>
<p>ripped all these wires out of the wall</p>
<p>and had them fixed and it was like</p>
<p>instantly</p>
<p>gone because I was doing all these other</p>
<p>things first and I&rsquo;m like why do I still</p>
<p>have this thing but I will say that that</p>
<p>computer or anything with a large</p>
<p>battery</p>
<p>um and you&rsquo;re next to it gonna affect</p>
<p>the heart</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>okay thank you thank you Dr bird you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>welcome that&rsquo;s great thank you Kim uh</p>
<p>for participating so</p>
<p>um succinctly that really helped the</p>
<p>show okay let&rsquo;s see now</p>
<p>um oh boy we got to all of our quiz</p>
<p>questions and here the final one asked</p>
<p>why is milk better than water and</p>
<p>helping the burning sensation of eating</p>
<p>hot peppers uh and 85 percent of our</p>
<p>respondents say the fat and the milk</p>
<p>coats the stomach and the throat and</p>
<p>helps neutralize the spiciness 15 say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the protein in milk that</p>
<p>accomplishes</p>
<p>um the same thing and all of our Indian</p>
<p>Latino folks say who cares burnt it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>delicious me I agree with them love that</p>
<p>stuff but for the rest of us do so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually the the protein not the</p>
<p>fat the protein tasting</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s really a chemistry thing the</p>
<p>chemistry uh interacts with the</p>
<p>receptors and it helps to neutralize the</p>
<p>the burning effect on your receptors so</p>
<p>casein so that being said something</p>
<p>better</p>
<p>um than milk would be like cottage</p>
<p>cheese which has way more concentrated</p>
<p>casein and if you have some cottage</p>
<p>cheese around there put that in your</p>
<p>mouth and you&rsquo;ll find that um The</p>
<p>Burning will go away a lot faster</p>
<p>okay very good let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>social media&rsquo;s promise then we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to get to you uh Natalia uh just a</p>
<p>moment so let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Hein uh omega-6 we all learned about</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s see here sorry</p>
<p>uh 73 year old</p>
<p>oh here we go Cassandra from Facebook I</p>
<p>have half of an operating thyroid due to</p>
<p>goiter the other half is enlarged ouch</p>
<p>the only marker out of range is the TG</p>
<p>antibodies I want to preserve the</p>
<p>remaining portion of my thyroid any</p>
<p>suggestions Dr Berg</p>
<p>um yeah of course I&rsquo;m going to say</p>
<p>um you might need some iodine</p>
<p>um the thyroid will enlarge if if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>low in iodine but</p>
<p>that being said if we&rsquo;re dealing with uh</p>
<p>an autoimmune or Auto antibody situation</p>
<p>um you might benefit from</p>
<p>a product that I&rsquo;m not associated with</p>
<p>this company standard process but they</p>
<p>have a product called thyroid</p>
<p>thyrotrophin PMG which</p>
<p>um is interesting because you take it</p>
<p>uh and it goes into the stomach next</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a decoy so your antibodies that are</p>
<p>attacking your thyroid now go hey wait a</p>
<p>second let&rsquo;s go after the ones in the</p>
<p>stomach and they leave your thyroid</p>
<p>alone that way the inflammation can</p>
<p>start coming down and you can also at</p>
<p>the same time start taking more vitamin</p>
<p>D3 to reduce inflammation and now we</p>
<p>just have a better strategy for this</p>
<p>this autoimmune thyroid problem</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific hey uh Natalia thank you</p>
<p>so much for being so patient with us as</p>
<p>we try to get to everything uh in our</p>
<p>last few minutes uh if you would quickly</p>
<p>give us a one question 30 seconds Dr</p>
<p>Berger is going to change your life</p>
<p>oops I think you&rsquo;re muted deer if you</p>
<p>could unmute yourself</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s see it still says muted I think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a button on the lower right</p>
<p>there we go right now</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>can you hear me yes</p>
<p>my questions about my husband I hear</p>
<p>some healthy Keta intermittent fasting</p>
<p>fasting since June 2022 and he lost 80</p>
<p>pounds</p>
<p>my question about uh he did the address</p>
<p>BP profile and my questions are about</p>
<p>his blood test can I read his blood test</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m still I had a hard time</p>
<p>understanding the questions about a</p>
<p>blood test</p>
<p>Natalia were you talking about a blood</p>
<p>test for your husband</p>
<p>but yes my husband had a blood test test</p>
<p>uh he did in advance lipid profile</p>
<p>and uh</p>
<p>can I read the result and I want to know</p>
<p>doctor prescribed statins</p>
<p>and I want to know your opinion about it</p>
<p>you see he&rsquo;s on a Statin now</p>
<p>okay and is it just a problem with</p>
<p>cholesterol right yes yes</p>
<p>yeah can I give you uh</p>
<p>this test can I read this test the</p>
<p>problem is I didn&rsquo;t want to get into</p>
<p>like lab results because that&rsquo;s a long</p>
<p>answer to evaluate but I&rsquo;m going to tell</p>
<p>you something right I&rsquo;m assuming that he</p>
<p>had high cholesterol or it could be high</p>
<p>LDL or triglycerides whatever</p>
<p>um first the first thing is</p>
<p>um easy on keto is he doing a lot of</p>
<p>carbs</p>
<p>um if he if he he&rsquo;s on keto and he had</p>
<p>this cholesterol problem they want to</p>
<p>put him on statins what I would uh do is</p>
<p>I would</p>
<p>I would um do another test</p>
<p>called the advanced lipid profile test</p>
<p>and look at</p>
<p>he did that</p>
<p>okay okay so did he find that the the</p>
<p>large buoyant LDL is higher than the</p>
<p>small dense LDL lipoprotein</p>
<p>or was it just what</p>
<p>a slow dance</p>
<p>particle LS 19.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>High densely property</p>
<p>C 89</p>
<p>so the um the large buoyant is 89.</p>
<p>small low density particle was 19. no I</p>
<p>got that but it&rsquo;s the large buoyant LDL</p>
<p>particle size</p>
<p>uh large</p>
<p>buoyant</p>
<p>yes 89.</p>
<p>large a large densely property size</p>
<p>22.2 yeah good so it&rsquo;s higher so</p>
<p>um this is what this is what you want to</p>
<p>see</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so the the the</p>
<p>large buoyant is not pathogenic it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t create ethyl</p>
<p>atherosclerosis uh like the small dense</p>
<p>particle size does so even though</p>
<p>um see they&rsquo;re looking at the total LDL</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not not focusing in on the</p>
<p>the ratios and uh it looks like it has a</p>
<p>good ratio which means that um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it sounds like he&rsquo;s fine and so and then</p>
<p>if you put him on a Statin now we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to um and I&rsquo;m not telling you not</p>
<p>to take I can&rsquo;t tell you that but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>telling you that the statins have a lot</p>
<p>of complications with</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>with myopathies muscle problems fatigue</p>
<p>and increased risk of calcified arteries</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s just the data out there so you</p>
<p>have to make your own mind but</p>
<p>um the other thing is when someone takes</p>
<p>a Statin uh it depletes or coenzyme Q10</p>
<p>which then uh they don&rsquo;t get as much</p>
<p>heart protection and they better be</p>
<p>taking the cons on Q10 because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really</p>
<p>um what takes it&rsquo;s kind of like it it it</p>
<p>binds with the LDL and that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>transported through the body so now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to eliminate that eliminate</p>
<p>the coenzyme Q10 now we have all these</p>
<p>side effects</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s I would not watch my latest</p>
<p>videos on the LDL because there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>so much confusion on this area and</p>
<p>sometimes the doctors</p>
<p>um are stuck on the old theories that uh</p>
<p>they need you need to find a doctor that</p>
<p>is that really understands even if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s cardiologists out there that you</p>
<p>can get Consulting for from that will</p>
<p>give you the true picture of this LDL</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great well thank you so much</p>
<p>Natalia and just I I brag to the</p>
<p>audience who are going to try to get</p>
<p>back to social media how about one more</p>
<p>question and this comes from Felipe from</p>
<p>Facebook I get a pain in my left</p>
<p>shoulder uh when I eat too much how do I</p>
<p>fix this problem that sounds odd</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t eat too much there you go</p>
<p>drum roll please</p>
<p>oh I think that makes sense well doc</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re about out of time</p>
<p>so um yeah we have one minute left I</p>
<p>just want to tell you I did a study I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing a lot of studies now</p>
<p>um did a study on</p>
<p>on sprouts or micro greens okay and I</p>
<p>was just</p>
<p>I wanted to know</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s going on in a micro green as</p>
<p>far as the microbiome bacteria and uh</p>
<p>and and other microorganisms inside</p>
<p>plants right you might not think that</p>
<p>they have a microbiome but they sure do</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m looking at these results and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re sorting it out and I was just I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>do a video on this but I was literally</p>
<p>shocked to find out</p>
<p>how many different species of microbes</p>
<p>that are in plants that you eat in your</p>
<p>salad I mean it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really interesting it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>a probiotic so when I saw that list I</p>
<p>was like if an average person really</p>
<p>knew that um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>about the microbes inside the plants</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like wild so stay tuned for a</p>
<p>video on that with a lot addition a lot</p>
<p>more videos on on interesting topics but</p>
<p>I want to thank everyone for sticking</p>
<p>around this long have a wonderful</p>
<p>weekend we will see you soon and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>almost at 10 million subscribers on</p>
<p>YouTube so</p>
<p>um I will release the video out when we</p>
<p>hit that Target</p>
<p>but um thank you and have a wonderful</p>
<p>weekend</p>
